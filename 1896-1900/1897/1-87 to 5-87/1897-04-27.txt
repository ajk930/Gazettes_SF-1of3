BRAVE GREECE
MUST NOW BE
HUMILIATED
Cold-Blooded Policy of the
Powers in Dealing With
the Hellenes.
CROWN PRINCE CONSTANTINE
IS RELIEVED.
Ignorance and Cowardice on the Part of
the Greek Commander Said to Have
Caused an Unnecessary Retreat
From Mati.
;CopyrlentÂ«d 1897 by thÂ» New York Sun.l
LONDON, ENG., April 26. â No humiliation is to be spared the
unhappy Greeks. The only mercy they will receive will be such as
the infuriated Turks may grant. The stern decision of the powers is
that no hand will be interposed on behalf of Greece until she humbles
herself in the dust and craves pardon and help from Christian
Europe.
Balfour, leader of the Government party in the House of Com
nnounced this cold-blooded policy in the House to-day in
milder words than these, but the meaning is the same and is fully con
firmed by news from other capitals.
Friends of Greece in London profess to believe she will retrieve her
fortunes, and they credit the disaster to inexperienced leaders. The
latter is apparently the belief also in Athens, for a change is just
announced in the Greek command, but the country has no military
leaders of proved ability. The best war authorities of Europe all
agree that Greece is now at the mercy of the Turkish troop.-.
There is some reason to believe, however, the Turk will soon
stay his hand. Latest dispatches from Turkish sources indicate that
Edhem Pasha has reached the limit of his instructions in capturing
Larissa, and the Sultan's real mentor did not intend he should go
beyond Thessaly. Unless, therefore, the Turks are intoxicated with
victory and break loose from Russian and German control, a halt will
soon be called.
CONSTANTINE RECALLED.
Relieved From tha Command of
tho Greek Army-Panic Among
Refugees at Volo.
ATHENS Greece April 2Â«.â A royal
decree h&s been issued recalling Crown
Prince Constantine from command of ihe
Greek army in Thessaiy, together w;th
his entire -taff. Premier Delyannis had
several lone conferences with the King
last eren-.nz, the results of whic:i are not
made public.
News received from Volo is of a most
serious character. Upward of 10,000 panic-
Firicfcen refueees are assembled there.
They expect Edhem Pasha will attempt
to capture the town on account of the im- I
mense quantities o: Greek stores accumu
lated there. The Government has sought I
to allay the panic by pointing out the
presence of tue Greek fleet, which the j
authorities say is abundantly able to as- i
sure protection.
Premier Delyannis has issued a state- I
ment describing the situation and in
forming the public the alarm felt in regard
to the safety of the refugees and other
occopanta of Volo is needless, as there is
not tin sliehtest reason to fear the Turks i
will occupy the place now that 40,000
Greek troops are occupying Pharsaia.
CONSTANTINOPLE. Turkey. April i
26. â The Greeks are fortifying the town of
VeiÂ«Btinos, near Volo, fearing the Turk*
Trill attack the latter place. It is said
mnofa credit for the success of the Turkish j
operations is due to Seifullah Bey, for- !
merly l'arkisli Consul at Volo, who knows !
the territory of Thessaiy and rendered !
valuable service to the Turkish forces by
bis description of the topography of the I
country.
LONDON, Exg., April 26.â The Athens
correspondent of the Daily Mail says Colo
nel Bmolenitz has been appointed chief of
Â§taff in Thessaiy. The dispatch adds, the
engine, with a teieeraph clerk aboard, has
been sent to Larissa to learn the condition
of affair? there. The correspondent rte
clares there is an air of mystery in the I
whole matter, and that it is insisted that
.Larissa has not yet been occupied by the
Turks.
REVEALED BY RALLI.
Cowardice and Incapacity of Con
stantine and Stobb Caused
the Disaster.
ATHENS, Gbsbcb, April 26. â Ralli,
Jeader of the ojijjo>ition, arrived from the
front last nielit. He makes the startling
statements of utter confusing ignorance
and lack of plan characterizing the con
fleet of the war. He declares the country
hag been the victim of a series of deplor
able blunders which have demoralized the
arruy, and vehemently condemns the at
tempts bf the ilinisters to hide the bitter
truth from the people. Colonel Smolen
i'.i'i appointment as chief of staff was
made to satisfy Ralli, who threatened to
Luaea proclamation exposing the farce of
the military organization.
LONDON, Exc, April 26.â The Tele

A dispatch to the Standard from Athens
i describes the feeling there as one of pro
| found discontent and disappointment.
: The people are pntihed by the statement
that the Crown Prnce has been recalled.
The populace ascribes the disaster to the
i blundering of tne royal family. The pos>
â  tior. of the latter is undeniably critical.
1 The correspondent says he is credibly
! assured an arrangement has been made to
enab.e them to leave the country with
speed if necessary. The populace is de
manding that they be armed. They wouid
not tamely consent to a conclusion of
peace.
The Times' Athens correspondent, tele
graphs that some person-* believe that
Ralli aims to lill the roil of a Greek Gam
betta and has already succeeded in con
centrating public attention on himself.
In an interview with the Times' corre
spondent he denies there was any real
battle at Mati and accuses the Crown
Prince and staff of cowardice and inca
pacity. He details the mistakes made in
Friday's enpagemeat, including an error
which caused the foreien legion to come
in contact with the squadron of Greek
cavairy, believing tl;e latter were Turk?.
The foreign legion fired upon the Greeks,
thus increasing the panic. One Greek bal
talion, entering Turnavo aiter the Turk
ish occupation, was compelled to surren
der. Ralli estimates the entire Greek loss
since the outbreak of hostilities at 2000
killed and wounded.
GREAT ARTILLERY DUEL.
Vivid Description of the Fierce
Fighting at Matl, Where the
Greeks Blundered.
LONDON, Enq., April 26 âThe corre
spondent of the Daily New" with the
Greek army sends a dispatch from Tur
navo, dated Friday, giving a d scription
of the lighting between Mati and Dereh,
and estimates the Turks who participated
at over 12.000, while the Greeks oniy num
bered "000. Tue latter were re-en;orced
by 5000 in the eveninp, but it was then too
late to share in the battle.
The Greek headquarters was on a hill
at Kriiiri. near Miluuna Pass. The in
faniry lay concealed tw-hind the hill. The
enemy first made a combined cavalry and
infantry attack, but was repulsed with
little difficulty. Then began an artillery
duel which lasted, with few intermissions',
from 8 o'clock in the morning until 5 in
the evening. Continuing, the correspond
ent says:
"For hours I he air was full of screaming
shells, chiefly shrapnel. Fortunately
for the Greeks the thousand odd shells
fired by the Turks resulted in barely
twenty casualties Toward 8 o'clock in
the afternoon it became evident that the
enemy had withdrawn the artillery into a
ravine at Ligaria. Tie Greeks' mountain
battery, under command of Captain
PiakoÂ«, especially attracted the enemy's
fire. Bhel:s rained upon this devoted
band, which occupied the extreme Greek
left and which, ignoring the Turkish rire,
continued shelling Gritzovali with ad
mirable precision.
"Indeed, a special feature of the duel
was ;he surprising steadines* of the Greek
batteries, in which, with shells bursting
around, I rtid not see â  man start or horse
plunge. About 3 o'clock the enemy* ri re
began to come only from Ligaria. The

ALL MEN HONOR THIS HERO'S MEMORY.
During the Dedication of the Monument to General U. S. Grant
There Will Be the Grandest Military, Naval and Civic
Parade Ever Witnessed in This Country.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 26â All New York blossomed like a flower-garden to- I
day. Hags and bunting decorated the hotels, stores, clubs an<i houses, and gayly
i appareled soldiery made gorgeous the sidewalks and roadways. There was every
Kind of soldier this Nation affords and a pretty considerable smattering of foreigners.
All arrangements for the dedication of the monument to General Grant on River
side Drive tc-morrow are complete. There will be one of the grandest military,
naval and civic parade? the country has ever witnessed. It is nearly twelve years
since General Grant s body was placed in the temporary vault at Riverside Drive.
Tlie raiting of the fund has been largely due to the unflagging real of General Horace
Porter, chairman of the monument committee, now Embassador to France. General
Granville &!. Dodge has been chosen grand marshal of the parade, which will be
memorable in the annals o; the Republic Governors of nearly all the States will De
present in person or proxy.
The G. A. R. will send post after post from ail quarters of the country. The en
tire National Guard of New York, 13,000 strong, ana of New Jersey, will take pa-t,
and Pennsylvania will send 5000 men and nearly 10,000 members of uniformed veterans
of the war. Ten thousand more In civ.c bodies of all kinds will swell the total to at
Uast 50,000 men, who will pass in review. About 4000 regular troops, including half a
dozen batteries of artillery, will be in line.
The programme calls for the movement of the line at 10:30 a. m. The exercises at
tho tomb will oecin between 11 and 12. It Is expected the exercises will be finished
by 12:30, irhen lunch wiil bf> served to 500 or more euestf. The services at the tomb
will be simple. Mothodis; Bisiiop Newman, General Grant's former pastor, will make
the opening prayer, and then General Porter wiil turn the monument over to the city.
Mayor fctronp wiil receive it. President McKinley will deliver an address of eu
logy.
The nava! parade, of which New York has become fond of lÂ»te years, will be an
important feature. Great Britain will have two warships in line; Italy, Spain,
I Mexico, Germany and France one each. The following American ships wiil take
part: The cruiser New York, the flacship of the squadron; the Columbia, Maine.
Texas, Amphitrite, Puritan, Fern, Dolphin, Ericsson and Porter, in addition to the
Brooklyn and Indiana.
In the evening the fleet will be illuminated. All the boats will pass up the river
and fire salutes in front of the tomb. After reviewing the land forces the President
will review the fleet, which promises to be nearly as extensive as that of the Colum
bian parade of 1893.
Prosident McKiuley, accompanied by his wife, Cabinet and the whole diploma
tic corps, arrived this afternoon in a sp?cial train escorted by Squadron A in gor-
Greeks turned tiieir fire exclusively in
that direction, firing battery volleys,

there and hoping to pound them up
a_a:nsl a craggy ascent of the Miloutia
Pass, but under cover of this ostensible
artillery re'reat the wily Turkish intantry
rushed rapidly nlong tiie foot of the
mountains toward thÂ« entrance of Tempe
Pass and occupied the village of Derail in
time to forestall General Marromichaiis,
who was marching on the village with two
infantry batallions and three squadrons of
cavalry.
"Mavromicbalis thereupon retreated
precipitately without faring a shoi. Al
most concurrently with his retreat the
commander at Los Faki heliographed to,
geous uniforms, and were driven rapidly to their hotels amid the cheers of thousands
gatnered along the route. Among tlie first of the reception committee at the
Pennsylvania depot was Cuauncey M. Depew, to whom was piven the task of taking
care of the British Embassador. When the train arrived there was considerable
confusion until the members of tne reception committee could find the guests al
lotted to them. Whitelaw Reid took charge of Patenotre, the French Embas
sador, and the Mayor's secretary (Hedges) of De Lome, the Spanish Minister. The
president ot the Board of Alderman (Jorolman) had a dreadful time. The Aus
trian Mioister had been allotted him, out could not be found. Jerolman rushed
around with the hat on the back of nis head piteously inquiring for his charge.
He did not find him until the ferry-boat was reached, and after that he did not al

President McKinley wore the usual black and seemed bright and cheerful, al
though dark rings around his eyes showed the strain of office and office-seekers has
had its effect. Leaving the majority of the narty at the Fifth-avenue Hotel the
President and suite were driven to the Windsor, over which the President's flag
floated for the first time in a New York Hotel since 1832, when Jackson was here.
President and Mrs. AlcKinley went direct to their rooms. Mrs. McKmley was ex
hausted by the journey and the excitement of the reception, and word was given out
that the President would see no one. But the President counted without his host.
Senator Hanna appeared and was ushered into the President's apartments. Then
there was muÂ«ic to me tune of "Dixey," by the Stonewall Brigade band of Staunton,
Va., heading a camp of the Sons of Confederates, which stopped in front of the hotel.
This is the band whose members Grant told at Appomattox to keep their instruments,
and to them was given the honor of serenading the President. They were cordially
received by McKinley. The President will stay here until Friday. All the rest of the
party will return Wednesday forenoon.
General Grant's rive surviving classmates at West Point were dined to-night by
General James Grant Wilson. They are General Christopher Augur, General William
Franklin, General Samuel French, General Joseph Reynolds and Rev. Dr. George
Deshon. The Confederate Gen-rals Buckner and Lor.estreet also had a paity. Henry
Irving to-day cabled to General Porter: "Love and greeting. All honor to the mem
ory of the great soldier, statesman, patriot and friend which you celebrate to-day."
The busiest piaca in the immediate vicinity of the to mb to-day was the pavilion,
where the official luncheon will be served, immediately north of the tomb. Two
hundred men and girls have b2en at work there three days preparing food for
the luncheon. They worked all to-night, making 30,000 sandwiches, 25,000 chicken
croquettes and cooking 17,000 hams in addition to the preparation of several barrels
of coffee.

a Decisive Battle.
NEW ORLEANS, La., April 26.â The
steamer Breakwater arrived to-day, bring
ing the latest news of the Honduras revo
lution. The vessel aho brought several
American refugees. They compiain that
Dr. Miller, the American C'onsui at Puerto
Cortez and San Pedro, is not vigorous
enough, and allowed the commandant at
Puerto Cortez to carry things with a high
hand over the American railroad conduc
tors and employes there and threaten
them in his presence.
The revolutionary movement, the Amer
ican passengers say, is directed by ex.
President Desoto, who is said to be in
Belize, ready to land in Honduras wben
the occasion is promising.
The attack on Puerto Cortez was sudden
and vigorous and took the Government
completely by surprise. Tue attacking
party was composed mainly of American*
and Englishmen, led by an Englishman
named Drummond. The party was well
armed with Winchester rifles and had two
Gatline guns, to which much of their suc
cess was due.
Drummond became involved in trouble
at New Orleans and Mobile recently for
shippine rifles in bales of hay to Guate
mala. He then took a hand in tb? Cuban
revolution, and finally inspired Desoto's
revolutionary movement. Oniy fourteen
men were in the revolution at the begin
ning, but they were determined men.
They were nearly all foreigners, and when
they appeared befoie C*bildo and opened

ber, fled to the Koods.
Enriched by the custom-house receipts.
Drummond and his army captured all the
neighboring villages, attacked tho town
of San Pedro, where Government forces
300 in number were put to flight, and
captured two entire trains and loco
motives. Findinjr a large proportion of
the population dissatisfied *vuh the
Bonilla regime, Drummond and his army,
now swollen to 1000 men, started last
week to Tegucigalpa. The revolutionists
expect to gain recrufts on the march and
appear before the capital with a consider
able army, deciding the fate of the re
public by a big battle there.
GOMEZ ON THE AGGRESSIVE.
Two Large Forces of Insurgents Prepar

vation and Fnancial Chaos.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 26.â Cuban Gen
eral Mayia Rodriguez is marching to in
vade the province of Pinar del Rio with
3000 men. He was seen yesterday between
Batabano and Guines, near the military
line made there by the Spaniards to pre
vent his invasion. A big battle is expected.
Rodriguez is acting under strict orders
from Gomez to make the war lively in the
west of the island, while he harasses the
strong Spanish columns in Santa Clara.
Another strong body of insurgems under
Genera! Alejandro Kodriguez is also mov
ing to the west in order to protect the ad
vance of the other column.
Much comment is occasioned by an ar
ticle in Diaria de la Marina, in which it is
asked how the Government can meet be
fore the end of the year the war expenses
and general obligations of the treasury.
The article is founded on an official
report of the condition of the island,
which shows that all the revenues
of the island this year will only amount to
$15,000,000 in gold, silver and paper
money. On interest of the debt alone the
Government will have to pay $30,000,000
in gold, and in addition the expenses of
the army, navy and other items of the
budget. The deficit will be more than
$100,000,000.
Fifty persons died yesterday from hun

WICHITA, Kanp., April 26.â Mrs. Mary

legarding the charges of corruption that
have been preferred against her by ex
fcenator Kelley. He charges her with sell

repiments were scattered by companies
over the battlefield when the order for re
treat arrived, and as me order was urgent
the retreat became very disorderly.
The sudden retreat of the Greeks vras a
surprise to everybody on the Turkish
staff. The latter expressed astonishment
ihat the Hellenes should relinquish the
defense of a position in which they were
strongly entrenched, and which appar
ently was tenable against a larger fores
than the Turks possessed. Ralli in Ath
ens confirms the reports that the staff or
dered the retreat without reason. Sol
diers are asking despairingly, "Why
hhould we retreat? We are not beaten."
The Turks did not pursue the Greeks.
They were not prepared for a pursuit, not
â¢ â .reaming after a single engagement that
Thessally would be left at their dis
posal. Ralli put-s the total Greek loss at
100 killed and 300 wounded.
ATTITUDE OF NEUTRALITY.
England, However, Willing to Do
Everything Possible to Mediate
Between the Combatants.
LONDON, Ew., April 28.â The House
of Commons resumed sittings to-day,
after the Easter recess. There was a
very small attendance. Sir William Har
court asked tha Government to i eiir.e
their policy in regard to Turkey. Baifour,
First Lord of the Treasury, said tne Gov
ernment, like the rest of the powers, had
agreed the attitude of neutrality was de
sirable. When occasion arose, he added,
they would do everything possible to me
diate between the combatants.
In regard to Crete Baifour said that the
powers had determined the littoral of that
island should be neutral. The Foreign
Grace throughout the afternoon has main
tained a constant interchange of dis
patches with the diplomats of the powers.
The reported advance of the Greets
upon Janina has been arrested and Colo
nei Manos, commander of the forces oper
ating in Epirus, has returned to Ar:a.
The Turks declare there is not a single
Greek soldier in Turkish territory. A
dispatch from the headquarters of the
Turhish army near Turnavo says after the
retreat of the Turks was begun EJhem
Pasha seated in a tent abandoned by the
Greeks said in French to a war correspond
ent, "It is finished."
Edhem Pasha posted sentinels at the
doors of Greek churches in Turnavo and
kept strict order everywhere. All the
Greek prisoners were treated humanely.
Edhem hoped to entrap and crush the

Albanian troops sinking as they advanced,
gave warning to Prince Constantino that
it was time to retreat.

BIG SHIPMENT CF GOLD.
In Doing So a New York Firm Violates
the /greem;nt Made by Foreign
Bank mg- Houses.
NEW YORK, >'. V., April 2ftâ Mailer,
Scball ifc Co. witndrew to-day from the
United Srates Assay Office $977,000 in gold
barsfor shipment to Bremen by the steam
ship Trave to-morrow. The immediate
effect of the withdrawal was thedissolution
of the agreement recently entered into by
large foreign banking-houses not to export
gold until the price for the demand for
sterling bills reached 48S^. The order on
which the gold was snipued reached this
city Friday. It came hr*t to Heideibacn
lckelrnier & Co., who declined to execuie
it, giving the agreement as a reason, but
Muller, Schall Â»fc Co. to whom the order
next carve. made arrangements Saturday
to ship the gold, placing the bills at the
highest, rates obtainable. Th ir corre
spondents will stand any possible loss on
the transaction and pay a commission in
addition.
The Dills were sold chiefly to Lazard
Freres, another firm in the agreement,
who were much surprised when they dis
covered it had been Hiding in the arrange
ments for shipments of gold. Members
of foreign bankinc houses, who are parties
to the agreement, expressed surprise at
the action of Muller, Scball <fc Co., and
went so far as to call it a "breach of
faith."
On news of the dissolving of the agree
ment between the foreign banking houses
the sterling exchange market weakened
to-day, with actual closing rates for de
mand sterling at 457?^ anu 483. It is re
ported, mc uding the amounts already
announced, that gold exports for the week
would probably aggregate $3,000,000. The
existing premium for gold abroad is be
lieved to be an important factor in caus
ing the gola shipment at present when
there is a decided trade balance in favor
of this country. In London the bar sell
ing price is 77a llj^l to 7Sa an ounce,
which is virtually a i w rniuni of Id.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 27, 1897.
Map of Part of Greece, Showing the Principal Routes to Athens
From the Northern Frontier and the Gulf of Patras on the West.
With the Greeks' navy in control of the coasts and the nature of the country
traversed by the roads from Larissa to Athens considered, the Tursish army is very
far as yet in point of time, if not distance, from Greece's capital city. From the
frontier to Larissa, and even as far as Pharsala. the advantage afforded by the char
acter of the country was with the Turks. From the frontier to Lariss:i their march
was down hill all the way, and with the numerous roads traversing the ' Thessalian
Piain" in every direction between Larissa, Trikala, Karditza and Pharsala they could
easily flank and cut off any Greek force attempting to make a permanent stand on
the way from Larissa to Pharsala. Not so is it below, however. The plains of Thec
j saly are bordered on the south and west sides by the foothills of the Orthrys and
I Pindus Mountains, making a natural barrier, which, starting with a heicht of from
j two to four hundred feet, slops backward and upward to the crests of the parent
! ranees.
Two good roads lead from the plains over the Arthrys to Lamiaâ one from Kar
â  ditza on the west, which ascends the valley of the Sophaditikos River, and the other
j the main road to Athens. These two come close together in Phourka Pass, something
| over LWO feet bigb. Here are strong fortifications commanding both roads and
! flanked by others at intervals for some twenty miles or more commanding every road
'â  crossine the ranee. On the right the precipitous character cf the mountains, which
| continue to ascend until they culminate in the paak of Guokavani, over 5509 feet high,
; admits of but few roads, and these not practicable for wheeled vehicles.
Pharsala lie 3 on the southern side, nsar tae extreme eastern end of the plain,
j whic is there about live miles broad and traversed by tha Empeios and Fharsalitis
i rivers, and at the foot of a spur of Knassidiari Mountains, which rises from the
j edge of the town very abruptly to a height of 380 feet. Strong by nature, tlie position !
commanding the ascent of the hill can be male impregnable.
The lines at Pharsala can be successfully defended by half the number of troops
! required on the line north of Larissa, with proper generalship. Lamia lies at the loot
I of the Orthrys on the northern side of the level plain of the Sphercheios River, and
i within live miles of the coast. From it the road to Athens crosses the nver and plain
|to Thermopy!;* 1 . In the days of Leonidas there was here an easily closed defile not
! over fifty feet wide. Now there is between the mountains and the a plain one to
three miles broad, formed by the deposits of the Sphercbeios River and several moun
tain torrents, and by action of earthquakes which have changed the course of the
river and tbo shore line. It is still a very defensible Place, not only from the heights
overlooking the plain, bnt by vessels in the culf and the channel of Talontas. and
likewise for mile 3 beyond until the road leaves the coast, and even then all the nar to
' Thebes it is full of natural facilities for disputing tbe passage of a hostile army. The
same may be said of the other road which, leaving Lamia in a southerly direction,
crosses the mountains to the valley o! the Mavro Neri River, and which it follows to
Thebes, there joining the main roai.
Should the Turks succeed in forcing the Greek lines at Pharsala and getting to
Lamia and beyond, their progress will necessarily be very slow. Cut off from Salonika
by sea, they will have to maintain a lone line of communication by land which will
require the protection of quite a large number of troops, and the further they come
i the greater will te this disadvantage, which the Greeks should be prompt to make the
> most of.
In case of necessity tbe Greeks can brine thair army from Arta and Epirusina
j very short time to Edbeni Pasha's front or to Athens, by sea to the eastern cxtrem
; ity of the Gulf of Corinth or to Patras and thence by rail, or from Arta to Maupaktos
by land and thence east by water or rail.
"With the aid of their fleet the Greeks should ba able to hold Volo and keep open
, the line of railroad by Velestino to Pharsala.
THEODORE HAVEMEYER DEAD.
From an Humble Beginning He Became
the Greatest Sugar Refiner
in the World.
NEW YORK. N.Y., April 26.â Theodore
Havemeyer, vice-president of the Ameri
can Sugar Refining Company, died at 3
o'clock this morning from a sudden at
\ tack of typhoid fever, following a two
| weeks' siege of the grip and eenerally
j shattered health, His death was totally
! unexpected by the outside world, although
I intimate friends had known for a week
hi 3 illness was dangerous. Not until Sun
day night did the physicians believe the
! patient beyond hope.
Mrs. Havemeyer is a devout Catholic,
and knowing the end was near her hug
band requested that be be baptized into
that faith. A priest baptized him five
hours before he died. H. O. Havemeyer
heard of his brother's dangerous condi
tion Sunday evening at his home in Stam
ford, Conn. He chartered a special train to
arrive in time. Havemeyer was 58 years
of age and all his life had been identified
with the sugar interest. He entered his
father's refinery when a boy and worsed
with other employes. Step by step he ac
quired a perfect knowledge of each branch
of the business until, when his father died,
he was competent to tt:ke entire charge of
the business, whicli he practically did. H.
O. Havemeyer took the financial branch
and Theodore the refinery. Under the old
firm the title was Havemeyer &. Elder,
and the brothers became the greatest su
gar refiners in the world.
Since the establishment of the trust the
deceased had the entire supervisou of all
practical details of the refineries operated
by the company. His fortune is estimated
at about $20,000,000.

THE TARIFF BILL
ABOUT COMPLETED
Californians Working
for the Interest of
the State.
Making a Strong Effort for
Increased Duty on
Fruits.
A Conflict Between Growers and
Manufacturers Over tho
Wool Schedule.
WAfeHINGTON, D. C, April 26. -The
Californians, re-enforced by telegrams
from John D. Spreckels, /rank McLaugh
lin, Colonel Otis and prominent citizens
and commercial bodies in all parts of Cal
ifornia, are still pegging away at the
Finance Committee in an attempt to in
crease the duty on California products,
especially fruits.
The Republican members of the Finance
Committea expect to Jay the result of
their revision of the Dinpley tariff bill be
fore the full committee during tne present
week, provided the organization of the
committee snail be completed. Those en
gaged in the revision have been very reti
cent touching the changes made, am this
policy has been followed simiily to avoid
the annoyance and importunities that al
ways follow when details of a revision of
the tariff are made public. They admit,
however, that many changes have been
mace and that as a rule the chances are
on a descending scale. Increases have
been made, but these are not numerous,
and as a rule have been made upon the
demands of Senators whose votes were
considered to be contingent upon securing
the desired change;.
The wool schedule has not been per
fected and it is not likely to be until the
bill reaches the Senate. The conflict be
tween the growers, the manufacturers ana
those who claim to represent the consum
ers can only be settled after a protracted
struggle and discussion in the Senate. It
might be determined in the full commit
tee, but such a result is not anticipated.
Lumber, coal, su^ar and lead ore sched
ules are also unsettled.
There is a proposition that the bill
shall be brought from the Finance Com
mittee without the usual detailed exam
ination and consideration, and that the
time for talcing up the bill in the Senate
shall be determined by the Democratic
members ot the Finance Committee. The
purpose of this movement is lo avoid the
importunities that would follow the pub
lication ot the bill v ben 'laid before the
committee. It is the desire of the Repub
lican managers that the bill shall come
from the committee to the Senate with as
few changes as possible and within the
shortest possible time.
When reported to the Senate those per
sons who are dissatisfied with its pro
visions and desire to eS?ct changes will be ;
obliged to apply to the Senate, and in
this way the members of the Finance
Committee would be relieved of impor
tunity. It is doubtful whether the Demo
cratic members of the committee will con
sent to surrender any advantage and de
prive themselves of the privilege of becom
ing familiar with the provisions of the bill
and the reasons that impelled cbangest n
rates simply to relieve their Republican
colleagues from the importunities of the
business men who are to be affected by the i
proposed changes Moreover, with the j
Finance Committee depending for a ;
majority upon the vote of one member
who is not in full accord with t.'.e Repub
licans, the Democrats see and appreciate â 
the advantage of their position, and will
naturally insist that the "measure shall be
regularly con>idered in the committee.
There are several leatures of the bill
which the Democrats and several other
Senators in opposition desire to bare
eliminated. One of these is the retroac
tive section. It would be easier to knock
this out in committee behind clos d doors
than to do bo In open Senate. Whether
the Democrats will consent to the bill re
ported from the Finance Committee with
out the usual examination and consid
eration will depend upon the changes
whicn the Republicans will consent to
have made before it is reported.
BELGIAM MJMSTEit UTOBEK.
Hi* Jjipointm-n' UinUtrb* the Plans of
Several Slatetnakers.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 26.â The
long-expected nomination of ex-Congress
man Bellamy Siorer to bo Minister to
Belgium went to the Senate to-day, thus
putting a quietus on De Young's pros
pects, as predicted in The Call.
Some of his friends now say: "De
Young did not want to go abroad, any
how." But it is a case of sour grapes.
Toe selection of Bellamy Storer for the
Belgian mis-ion has disturbed several
slates that had been fixed by Senatois and
Representatives. For example, ex-Rep
resentative Aldrich of Illinois was bsing
urged for the Belgian mission, and in ad
dition to the I.linois delegation had the
powerful backing of Speaker Reed. Mr.
Aldrich was the "arithmetic man" for Mr.
Reed during the ante-convention period
and performed for the Speaker similar
Bervice, but not so effective as that per
formed for Major McKinley by Repre
sentative Grosvenor. For this personal
labor and devotion to his Presidential in
terests Speaker Reed desired the Presi
dent to reward Mr. Alurich with one of
the best foreign missions, and as the Illi
nois man selected Belgium he was pushed
for that place.
Now comes Bellamy Storer with the
Belgium plum, requiring that Aldrich
shall seek elsewhere in the diplomatic
orchard for the desired fruit. This brings
him in contact with others in tearch of
diplomatic appointments, and in conflict
with Senators and Representatives with
"claims" npon th't President much
stronger than those of Mr. Aldrich and
his friends. Whether Aldrioh will be
able to break through the lines of those
who have been directing their efforts in
securing the missions to The Hague, Den
mark, Switzerland, Portugal, Norway and
Sweden remains to be seen.
The Russian mission is still at the dis
posal of the President, but so far as can
be ascertained there are no very strong
and anxious claimants for a four years'
residence at 'he capital of the Czar. This
isa tirst-class mission, with a salary equal
to that of London, Paris and Berlin, but
St. Petersburg is an expensive capital, and
its climate la undesirable to one who has
spent the years of his life in tho temperate
zone. Hence, there are fewer applicants
for that than for any of the smaller Eu
ropean missions.
As a matter oi fact, no man caa affoid
to accept one of the first-class mission!
and represent the United States witn
credit and dignity who is not posses-ed of
large wealth and who is not willing to ex
pend from $25,000 to $50 COO per annum.
Until Congress makes proper appropria
tions for the payment of Erubassadors
and Ministers to foreign countries, poor
men and men of moderate mÂ°ans, no
matter what their merits and qualifica
tions, are practically excluded from the
diplomatic service, so far as the principal
missions are concerned.
Tiie salary of an American Embass&dor
is $17,500 per annum. The British Em
bassador to th* United States is allowed
for additional expenses a sum twice that
allowed an American Embassador for
salary, and in addition the fornief is fur
nished with a large and commodious
residence, servants, etc.

SPALHI\G'S I i ABLE PLIGH.J.
Neither JZata JV'or Bl**p* and !>eems on the
fertfo of Innanity.
CHICAGO, 111., April 26.â The condi
tion of Charles W. Spalding, formerly
president of the Globe Savings Bank and
treasurer of the University of Illinois, is
most pitiable and unless something can
be done to quiet him he will undoubtedly
become insane. On Saturday he was or
derclinto the custody of the Sheriff and
was tafcen to th* County Jail. A warrant
had been issue i for his arrest on a charge
of ?ml'czz.ing $100,000 from the university
and he had been unable to secure $-50, 000
bnil, the amount required.
Up to the time of His actual committal
ho had maintained an appearar.ee of com
posure, but when he entered his cell he
broke down completely ami since that
time has neither slept nor eaten. He
seems on the point of collapse, both
physical and mental, and frequently
breaks down and cries like a child.
Spaldicg's friends say that his present
unfortunate position is due largely to his
infatuation for his typewriter, Sarah
Louise Krvin, for whom he deserted his
wife and family. The necessary bonds
would have been given to secure his re
lease if i c had consented to leave the
woman, but he refused to do so.

ATLANTA, Ga.. April 26.â There wts a
sensation in the Romeyn court* martial

of the spectators was enthralled until tbe
adjournment.
The testimony of the two preceding wit
nesses, Captain Bowen and Lieutenant
Kimball, was merely a rehash of the wit
nesses if the past three days, expressing
general disapproval at the garrison at the
relations of Lieutenant Bamford and Mrs.
O'Brien.
Miss Romeyn testified that she and Barn
ford had been engaged for over a year, and
her father, acting jointly with her, had
broken off the engagement on account of
the scandalous attentions Bamford was
bestowing on Mrs. O'Brien. She said:
"I have frequently seen him leave
O'Brien's house late in the evening when
all the lights were out. 1 knew Mrs.
O'Brien was unfit for any young man or
woman to associate with, for In the pre
ceding summer she told me she considered
a young man had a perfect right to fall in
iove with a married woman. Batuiord
made several desperate attempts to marry
me secretly. He was deeply in debt and
feared he could not avoid a court-martial
very Jong."

Startling Development* in the < assin
Defalcation Ca*e.
ATLANTA, Ga., April 26.â Startling de
veiopmems Have succeeded the reported
compromise in the Harry A. Cassin defal
cation case. Twenty-four hours ago Cas
sin, by his own confession, was short in
his accounts $45,000. Up to to-ni^ht an
amicable settlement seemed possible. Now
a meeting of the board of directors of the
crippled inst tution has discovered that
the alleged amount of shortage will be
multiplied several times, and that another
prominent official is implicated. A re
ceiver has been asked. This action pre
cipitated the application for a receiver for
the United Stales Bond ComDany, which
has branches in about 400 cities, the bonds
of which have been reearded as gilt-edged
securities in prominent centers of tee
North. Inspection of the books shows
mat the affairs of both concerns are in a
frightful condition.
Formal Se**ioni of Both Home*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 20â The
House to-day held a purely formal session.
Many of the members had gone to New
York to attend the Grant exercises, and
under the arrangements of Friday after
the readini of the journal an adjourn
ment was immediately taken until Thurs
day. Less than fifty members were pres
ent.
The Senate held a short session, which
was poorly attended, and formally ad
journed until Thursday.QUEEN`S JUBILEE
SPECIAL ENVOY
Rear-Admiral Miller Is
to Represent This
Country.
Embassador Hays' Court Cos
tume Causing Some
Discussion.
Cold Lace and Brass Buttons Sild
to Bo /bout the Proper
Caper.
WASHINGTON, 0. C, April 26.â 1t is
understood that Hear- Admiral Joseph N.
Miller of 'he navy lias been selected
spocia! envoy to represent the United
States at Q ueen Victoria's jubilee. Ad
miral Miller was r?cently ordered (o re
lieve Admiral Beardslee from the com
mand of the Pacific Naval fcMation. Last
week the orders directing lieardslee to
return home in May were revoked and his
tour of duty on the station extended until
July. The revocaiion is due, it is now
â said, to the intention of the Government
to send Miller to the jubilee. By detail
ing an officer of the navy to attend the
function the Government will, in a meas
ure, avoid embarrassment over any ques.
tion relating to the proper official uni
form to be worn by the representative of
the I* nited States.
Miller is entitled to wear a uniform of
the lushest grade in the naval service,
and will probably look as well a- any high
functionary of other countries, despite
the more modest showing of gold lace
and absence of decoration?.
At the coronation of the Czar last year
M:iior-General McCook represented the
United States as special envor, and wore
the uniform of his rank. Minister BrecK
inridge, who was obliged to attend the
coronation, had no military rank, and re
ceived a polite hint from the Russian
Government that he would bo expected
to appear in something a little more
showy than conventional evening clothes.
Breckinridge communicated with the
S - ate Department, and Cleveland and
Olney linally made a concession to the
monarchical ideas of the Czar's aress cen
sors by agreeing that Breckinridge could
wear .-omething less somber. The Min
ister appeared in a coat with long tails,
decorated with metal buttons, and knee
breeches.
No suggestion concerning an appropri
ate costume for Embassador Hay at the
jubilee has been made by the British
Government. It is unlikely that Hay
will receive a hint like that given Breck
inri ige. The British court has been very
lenient with representatives of the United
h-taies on the uniform question. Once,
while Buchanan was Minister to Sr.
James, there was a slight friction over the
decision that he must wear silver-buckled
pumps on state occasions.
As in the case of the lately mooted sub
ject of embatsadorial precedence, the
Btate Department avoids the issue, but
some officials of tiie department believe
tin C tne matter of gold lace and brass bat
tons for civilian dipoinatic representa
tives of the United States will soon come
to a crisis where a final decision will be
necessary.
FACTIONAL FEUD ENDED.
Suspended Knights of Labor Assemblies
Are Again Taken Into the General
Organization.
Washington, d. c, April 26.âGen
eral Secretary-Treasurer Hayes of the
Kni/jhts of Labor to-day reported as a re
sult of his recent visit to Pittsburg a set
tlement of the fight which has lasted
about three years between the General
Assembly and District Assembly No. 3,
Independent Order. This will increase
the membership of the Knights by about
20,000, and. it is said, wipe out the exist
ence of the Independent Order, which has
bren a source of considerable annoyance.
Hayes declares that within the past
year the Knights have doubled their mem
bership. Last week District 30 of Boston,
numbering 10,000 members, was rein
stated. The Southern miners have also
come baci into the order, and new dis
tricts have been orsanized in lowa, Michi
gan and Indiana. Last year only fifty- j
nine delegates Here seated in the Generai j
Assembly. Now he says more than a
hundred delegates are entitled to seats,
meaning that the order has gained more
than 50,000 members.

Chtcago'* Lake Front Came Before t.and
Committionrr Herman.
WASHINGTON, D. C. ADril 26.â
celebrated McKee scrip case from Chicago,
which involves the title to lake front prop- j
erty of untold millions, and upon which !
the homes of many of Chicago's leading
men are erected, came up to-day before
Commissioner of the Land Office Herman.
This is the case in which the decision of
former Commissioner Lamoreaux of Wis
consin, in favor of tne scrip-holders, was
set aside by Secretary of the Interior Bliss,
immediately after the latter's induction
into office, under circumstances that cre
ated something of a sensation.
At that time ex-Secretary John G. Car-
Jislo had agreed to accept a retainer of
$20,000 from the scrip-holders, but since
looking into the case he has decided to
leave it alone, upon the ground that it
â would not be proper for liiiu to appear aÂ»
counsel in a matter that he had indirectly
b*en concerned in while a Cabinet officer.
If Commissioner Herman poeÂ«s into the
matter in detail, as he is likely to do, the
hearing will be a prolonged one and may
be replete with sensational developments.

Information In addition to the notice of
Saturday from As&istantTriasurer Jordan
has been received about the heavy with'
drawalÂ« of gold from the sub-treasury at
New York. The department presumes
that the gold was withdrawn to-day, in
order that it mioht be shipped abroad to
morrow. It is believed the gold is going
to Japan or Austria.
Part of t lie Chinese indemnity fund was
placed to the credit of the Japanese Gov
ernment in Lomion, and Japan has been
drawing heavily on this Icr several wrek?.
Last Saturday Japan withdrew Â£25,000
sterling gold from the Bank of England.
It is said at the treasury that the move
ment oi gold toward Vienna indicates that
Austria will soon go on a gold basis. This
is practically but not entirely accom
plished. Large shipments of gold have
been made from London to Vienna, and
London is probably seeking to replenish
from the United States.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 26.â
Phillippe Edouard Marsan, a Frenchman
just arrived from the island of Tahiti, in
the South Seas, reports to Washington
officials that the insurrection of seven
weeks ago was only quellad by the arrival
of a French war vessel and a British gun
boat. The mnlcontent!" of the island, who
complain of the taxes levied by the French
republic, have formed a confederacy with
a disreputable refugee class known as
''beach combers," and this last party is
the disturbinj* element tbat is constantly
advocating a change of government. The
insurrectionists want either autpnomy or
annexation to the United States. They
believe that the island would be a strate

a Brief Session of the Grand
Lodge.
KEDWOOD CITY, Cal., April 26.-Red
wood is giving the glad hand to the Na
tive t>ons of the Golden West. Every in
coming train re-enforces the delegation
already assembled. Arxommodatioi.s, so
far as rooms aro concerned, seem to be
exhausted, and cots may command a
premium within the next twenty-four
hours.
There is a pretty fight on for grand
orator. This position is four annual
] blocks removed from the presidency of the
i State organization, but a custom estab
j lished some fiveyears ago decrees tbat the
I president shall ascend to the grand ter
i minal station through the way stations of
grand orator, grand lecturer and grand
vice.JgMany alert sons contend that an
i orator should be chosen for his ability to
! orate on September 9 without reference to
I the qualities that should adorn the presi
dential chair, but the custom honored in
the breach bids fair to be honored in fu
j ture observance.
Judge Davis of Amador is here con
ducting the campaign on behalf of R. <j.
Rust of hi* county for orator. C. M. Bel
l shaw, ex- Assemblyman and himself an
I orator of no mean pretensions, is on the
i ground holding aloft the banner of Frank
I L. Coombs of Napa. Mr. Coomb* was
Speaker of the Assembly of the last ses
| sion of the Legislature and was highly
; recommended lor the office of United
j States Minister to Japan. To u-<e a politi
cal term, il may be said that Mr. Coombs
was "turned down" in Washington, but as
politics cannot enter the Grand Parlor of
i the Native Sons, the Napa orator may be
j elected to the office to which he now as
j pires. Judge Davis, however, is supremely
j confident that h.s candidate, Mr. Rust,
I will win out.
The panic, a mile from town, this after
noon, was really an Odd Fellows' affair,
and perhaps something a little in the line
of politics may have been introduced on
emerald sward under the branching oaks,
I but nothing of the kind i% permitted in
! the Grand Parlor.
When the State organization was called
to order in the Alhambraâ the beautiful
house that Page Brown designed and C.
I Josselyn builtâ l4o parlors were repre
sented and 230 delegates responded to the
call of the roll. Henry C. Gesford, ex-
State Senator and grÂ«nd presid nt, pre
sided with grace, di.-nitv and firmness.
Leonard S. Calkins of Nevada City was
appointed official reporter of the sessions.
' As Mr. Calkin* is a newspaper man who
i guides the destinies of tlie Nevada City
j Transcript the scribes sent here for duty
i may approach him on terms of easy
1 familiarity. In an emergency, whicu
might present itself during the penic sea

a Concert.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., April 26.â
Native Sons were the guests of Redwood
City Odd Fellows at the picnic in Finger's
Grove, adjoining Wellesey Park, this
afternoon, and a happy time they had.
The scene at the grove was delightful.
Thousands of people clustered about In
groups under the ample treea.
But the central feature of attraction for
the youth and beauty was the pavilion,
where music of the waltz, polka and
cotillion was discoursed all the afternoon.
The pavilion was crowded by dancers
until the iiour for leaving the grounds
and then they departed reluctantly. The
decorations were in good taste.
To-night the city is handsomely illum
inated in honor of the Native Sons. Bridge
street, near the intersection of Main, is
spanned by a beautiful evergreen arch,
-upported on either side of the roadway
by double columns in the Corinthian
style. The word "Welcome" is illum
inated.
Rows of Chinese lanterns running par
allel with the bridge and Main streets and
crossing the thoroughfare give a radiant
effect. The decorations and illuminations
are extended to the suburbs of the city.
Visitors compliment Redwood City on the
publ.c spirit exhibited in the arrange
ments for entertaining guests.
An immense concourse of people
listened to an open-air concert in front of
the Courthouse to-night The indoor
exercise in the spacious pavilion Degan
shortly after 9 o'clock. At that time the
house was packed. Introductory remarks
were made by Joseph F. Coffey, president
of Redwood Parlor. The stately and stir
ring State song, "Hail California," was
sung by the High School chorus, led by
Miss Alyce Gates of San Francisco and
accompanied by the Roncovieri band.
The patriotic composition evoked earnest
applause.
George C. Ross welcomed the Native
Sons to Redwooc" City, and in reply H. C.
Gesford, the graua president, spoke in
fitting terms.
The press quartet â Fletcher Tilton,
Samuel Tucker, Frank Coffin and W. J.
Batchelder â entertained the audience,
and vocal solos were contributed by Miss
Alyce Gates, Miss Annie Rooney and Wil
liam McDonald.
F&RRX SUE It AT TACOMA.
Divorce* Wife of the Col* nil Bring*
Action for Alimony.
TACOMA, Wash., April 26.â The sepa
ration of Colonel and Mrs. C. P. Ferry,
which caused such a sensation in Paris in
1889, is recalled by a suit for alimony tiled
by MrÂ«. Ferry's attorneys last evening.
Mrs. Ferry, who now resides at 712 Taylor
street, San Francisco, makes affidavit that
Colonel Ferry, since December, 1895, has
failed to pay this alimony of $.~>o a month
for the support of his child, which is iv
the custody of its mother. She alleges
that the child is still living and is now 11
years old, that it is entirely dependent
upon its mother for its support, and tiiat
Mrs. Ferry, since December 1, 1895, has
supported it by her own efforts.
\\ hen the alimony was collected in 1895
Thomas A. McGowan of San Francisco,
then Mrs. Ferry's attorney, came here to
assist at the trial. He stated that Mrs.
Ferry and son were then living with the
family of a prominent San Francisco
judge, who were much attached to her.
She then resided on Bush street. Her
friends here understand that she has re
cently been keeping a boarding-house on
Taylor street.
Colonel Ferry stopped paying alimony
in December, 1895. * Yesterday his attor
ney asked Mrs. Ferry's lawyer to postpone
hearing on the suit for a week to i*ive him
time to raise money. This will be done.

Stockton Woman Brings
Suit Against Her
Rival.
Mrs. Humphrey Claims That
Mrs. Pope Robbed Her of
a Husband.
They Were Once Divorced, but Re
married. Only to Separate
Again.
STOCKTON, Cal.. April 26.â Attorney
James A. Louttit this afternoon filed a
novei and sensational suit, which adds
another chapter to the matrimonial his
tory of Mr. and Mrs. W. G. Humphrey.
Mrs. Humphrey sues Louisa C. Pope, the
widow of the late Tom Pope, the capital
ist, for $20,000 damages for alienating the
affections of her husband.
The suit is said to be the first of its kind
ever brought hi re. For|a full understand
ing of it.it is necessary to revert to the
upa and downs of the married life of the
Humphrey;:. They were wedded on No
vember 1. 1879, and lived happily together
for several years. They have two children
livingâ lnez and Ethel â girl twins, aged
eight years. A decree of divorce was
granted to Mrs. Humphrey on December
'JO, 1894. on the ground of cruelty. They
subsequently became reconciled, and on
the bin of March, 1895, were again mede
man and wile by a contract marriage.
The document was tiled for record on Feb
ruary 12 of this year, and created not a
little surprise, as that was the first Dublic
notice of the reconciliation. They got
along most harmoniously after their sec
ond marriage until late last summer, when
Mrs. Pope, it is said, "appeared on the
scone." Since then Mr. Humphrey has
been living on the Poperancn as foreman,
and Mrs. Humphrey has been alone.
The complaint recites the fact of the
marriage and states that Mrs. Humphrey
has been deprived of the support, affection
and fellowship of her h utband by Mm.
Pope and is thereby damaged to the
amount sued for. The case will be vigor
ously fought on both sides.

Why Your
| Nerves Are Weak.
mHERE ARE TWO KINDS OF
-I- nerves: Motor and Sensory. The motor
j nerves are nerve.* of motion, while the
I sensory nerve 3 are nerves ol" sensation.
Eveiy organ, every tissue in the body,
contains molor and sensory nerve 3.
These nerves are derived from the brain
and spinal cord.
The brain is nourished by the blood,
which nourishment comes from properly
digested food. Of course, the food must
contain the elements necessary to create
or build up brain tissue.
A poor dicestion makes poor blood;
poor blood makes a dull brain; a dull
brain makes weak nerves.
Joy's Vegetable Sarsapacilla jrives good,
j rich, red blood, good digestion and strong
nerves.
Nerves are always weak when you have
i indigestion, impure blood- torpid liver,
inactive kidneys and constipation of the
bowels.
' By the moderate use of Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla your digestion will be perfect,
pour blood pure, your liver active, your
I kidneys and bowels regular.
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla is purely a
j vegetable preparation; contains no corro-
i sive poison, such as salts of mercury and
potash.
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla acts mildly
on the different organs of V\q digestion,
making pore blood, a clear brain and
btrong nerves.
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla relieves
neuralgia, rheumatism, nervous dyspep-
sia, insomnia, headache, nervousness,
fainting spells, dizzy spells, staggering
spells, weak â â  spells, pa.ns in the back,
dragging sensation* in the hip, brow
pains, spots before the eyes, fou! stomach,
bad breath, rincing in ear, eructation of
gase , water brash, a disgust for food,
rush of blood to tho he-Â«<l and gnawing
j sensation in stomach. When you want
j to begin to get well iry Joy's Vegetable
j Sarsaparilla. It touches the rignt spot.

DUEL TO SETTLE
A LOVE AFFAIR
Two Rich Mexicans to
Fight With Pistols
Near Nogales.
Ex-Governor Izabal and Senor
Gonzaies of Sonora the
Principals.
The Husband of the Woman In
the Case Will Challenge
the Victor.
NOG ALES, AM7.., April 36.â 1t is re
ported here that a telegram from Her
mosillo, Sonora, was to-day received oy a
man named Joffroy asking him to select a
secreted spot in the United States BOt far
from the international boundary line, and
near this city, and to attend to other pre
liminaries to a due!, lie was cautioned
to use the utmost secrecy, bat darin the
day it leaked out that ex-Governor K:ifae!
lzabal of the State of Soaora, Mexico, and
Senor Ponisio Gonzales, one of the
wealthiest and moil prominent men of
Sonera, intend to cross the line to richt.
The challenge was given and accepted
two weeks aso. I.c causes .iing to it
created a sreat sensational HermosUlo,
and the affair has been the talk of the
whole St.stÂ« cf Sonora ever since. Al
though not a Roniero-Verastegul affair,
the prominence and character Oi the two
men suggest an approximate parallel.
Both gentlemen, it is said, b&ve been smil
ing upon the wife of Bertotomt A. S.ilido,
unknown to each otber until a week ago
last Tuesday, when Izabal learned that
he had a rival in Senor Gonzales.
When next they met the ex-Governor
began questioning Gonsales. and a heated
conversation ended in Izabal calling Gon
zales several names which, translated into
Knglish, would be represented by dÂ»Â«nes
and stars. Goasalea strnck the ex-Gov
ernor in the face. Both men then went at
it hammer and tones, and when they fin
ished Izabal haa a swollen eye and was
minus several teeth. His opponent sus
tained a sprained wrist and lacerated
knuckles, the result of forcibly coming in
contact with the other gentleman's
anatomy.
lzabal declared he would be revenue!
ana sent to Gonzaies a challence to fight a
duel. This was accepted, but tney have
not come toceiher ye;, as Izabal has been
almost blind and Gonsales' wrist has been
in bandages. They have also had consid
erable trouble over the choice of weapons,
the challenging pa:ty want::-.c to ficht
with swords, as Governor Izabal has the
reputation of being tbe best shot in So
nora, but they have finally concluded to
at revolvers.
In the mear. SaUdo, who is a prom
inent State official and was formerly a j
member of the Sonora Legislature, states
thai he intends to challenge the victor i
because the two had alienated the aifec- j
tions of his wife.
lzabal and Gcnzalet are both married
Bier., and to make the affair more compli
cated, their wives are sisters, Gonzales
is a rrandsoa of Franetsoo Serna, the
famous Mexican general, and is the owner i
of one of tae best sad richest haciendas
in Mexico. He is well liked by all who
know h:m, while on tne contrary, Izabal
iÂ« unpopular. Last year, when Qeneral
Escobedc was visuinc Sonora at the insti
gation of I'resident Diait, he was tendertd
* banquet by the Bcials at Hermosillo,
during which Izabal created a sensation
by throwing a lighted bur.en of cracK
ers under the table. He was Governor of
Sonora tor two yearsâ USHaadlS
The object In having the affair oi honor
tafca place near Nogales is to evade the
dueling law, which is very strict in Mex
ico. They believe that they can cross the
boundary, right on American soil, and the j
victor and taose implicated will be able to j
return to Mcx: unmolested.

The speaKer sitid that the Independent
Order ot Oda Fellows wss one of the frater

he.d to its tenets tnrocgh the war. Whi'e
the churches of the North and South were
dir.ded acainst each other and remained
so for years after the cose of the war. the
Odd Fellows remii'.ed true, and at the
assembling of the Grand Lodge at BÂ»lt
more at the close ol the xrar the boutbern
States wÂ«re promptly requested to send ur
theil representatives. They did so. and
were received witnout a dissenting voice.
On tbe desks of the Southern members

This statement provoked rounds of ap
plause from the big andi-nce.
At that meeting of the Grand Loace the

grown remarkably and has spread all over
the world.

OLD NAT FULMER`S
MEED OF SORROW
I Poverty Confronts One
of McKinley's Army
Comrades.
Barred â  From a Position to
Which the President Ap
' * pointed Him.
Lacks Educational Qualifications
Required of an Arizona
:^v*' 'Llna-Rlder. " "
PHCENIX, . Ariz., April 2ti.â A good
! deal of interest i* lelt here in the melan
j choly case of Nat Fulmer of Nogales. He
| was a member of President McKinley's
J regiment, tbe Tweniy-thlrd Ohio, but j
being in straitened circumstances he i
' could not afford tbe trip to Washington i
and was not present, along with the other
surviving numbers of the regimen, at
the inauguration ceremonies. He wrote
a friendly letter to the new President, how
ever, expressing his rearet at being un
able to attend, and -explaining -that his
abser.ee was dne to th<s fact that a neigh
bor who owed him $500 failed to pay on
time.
The President is said to have answered
i Fulmer's communication with an auto
graphic letter, in which' he thanked his
old comrade for rememberins him, ex- i
pressed his regret at not being able to
shake him by the hand and asked him if
he could do anything either personally or
officially to "promote his comfort and '.
welfare."
Nat Fulmer wrote back asking the
| President to appoint him Customs Inspec
' tor at Nogales. This is a subaltern posi
j tion under the Collector and the com
j pensation is Â§S0 a month. The duties of
the office are those of a "line rider" and
j t: c chief educational requirements are
I tnose of riding horseback, shooting a Win- i
! Chester and a General fcnowltdgeof the!
j contour of the conntry where the riding '
1 and snooting is to be done.
PreÂ».dent McKinley made the appoint
i meat unhesitatingly, and yet Nat Fulmer '
i has not assumed office, for the reason that
j he is deficient on Asiatic geography and
not fully informed upon the location of
Cape Finisterre or on the chemical com
position of coal gaÂ«.
It turns out that this position is under
j civil service rule, and a scholastic exam
! ination is necessary for all applicants. An .
examination was held at Noga!eÂ« not long
ago, and only a decrepit schoolteacher, ;
physically incapable of sitting on ahorse,
succeeded in answering enough of the ,
questions to pass.
NÂ»t Fulmer was with McKiuley in the
regiment when the latter received his first
start in life. This was after the battle of .
Antietair, when, through the sfeui and .
enerjsy of Commissary Sergeant William
McKinley in" hastliag off the wagons, the
members of the Twenty-third were the
only ones who had a cap of cofTee and a
crust of bread apiece to satisfy tneir hun
ger before turning in for tbe night. It j
was for this bit of -service that Colonel j
Rutherford B. Hayes promotea William I
McKinley to a second lieutenancy, ana
Nat Fulmer was his chief assistant on that j
occasion.
A good deal of interest is taken in Ful- j
mer's case here, and the matter has been
discussed a great deal in tbe local press,
while some of the Eastern newspapers
have also commented upon the peculiar
state of aftairs which prevents the Presi
dent's regimental comrade from serving
in such a minor position simply because
te lacks in scholastic attainments.

The flrnt keynote of the Woman's [

At iinrr the, happy phrÂ«Br "caught

voting in Ita favor and pi ending for its I
adoption.
"The congre s will please come to order. \
I will ask the janitor if he will kindly !
close the'doors during the prayer." With i
these wor.is Mrs. John F. Swift, president ;
of the Woman's Congress of the Pacific j
Coast, opeued their fourth annual Â«ession ]
yesterday morning and started the flow of '
reason and tie feast of deep thought and !
cultured observation.
The congress was a bit late in coming to !
order. The shift of the place of meeting j
from the First Congregational Church to
the GoMen Gate H.wl at such short notice
found the iadie* somewhat unprepared for
the reception of their interested adherents j
and euests. Ready hands, however, came
quickly to the rescue and by the time a!l
rose in silent reverence to join in prayer
the stage was bright with palms and fair
caila lilies, witn a touch of color added by
means of draperies 01 yellow bunting. On
the president table rested a huge bunco
of snow-white rose-, and everywhere was
discernible thai touc. of woman's hand i
that beautirie- and adorns even the cheer- I
less lecture platform.
In spite 01 the cheery bustle of prepara
tion and the natural pxcitement conse
quent UDon a ereat work carrying with it {
such tremendous results, the opening
fres>ion of the congress found the aotivb
members sa I with painful memor
ies.- On evÂ«ry tongua was the name, in
every mind the thought of the dear de
pared, revered late president, Mrs. Sarah
B. Cooper.
Judsing by the first day's session this I
congress will lack that spirit ot resiless
excitement of the suffrage coneress. There
â¢will probably not be ao much burning
eicquence and spirited rhetoric, but m re
of the general result of the union of
thought and heart that the object of thi*
congress, general education, inspires. Ii"
tliÂ« fourth congress has not brought such
well-known workers as the worthy Susan j
B. Anthony and her witty lieutenant, Miss i
Bhiiw, it has given in their stead such j
distinguished guests as Mrs. Helen Gar- j
dener and the Hindoo sage, Brahma- |
cnarin Bodhabhikshu.
The first day ression afforded no op
portunity for a lengthy discourse from I
these widely known orators, but their j
sententious responses to some of the dis- j
courses gave a foretaste of tne pleasures |
in store.
Mr?. Gardener's timely answer to Mayor j
Phelan showed her possessed of that j
ready wit, an apropos answer. She i
speaks in quick, clear-cut tones, each word '
carrying us weight and adding to the '
force of the whole. Her tribute to Cali
fornia was glowinu ana immediately cap
tured ail h- arts.
"I am not surprised at anything I see j
in California," she said. "The only thing |
that astonishes me 1- how all the | eDple !
happen to be rich. Wliere do they get
the tirue to make their money? They
certainly spend all their time, according
to my observation, in being courteous to
strangers."
. The Braumacharin thou^ri following
this neatly turned compliment, managed,
however, to win the sincere respect, if not
t.ne hearts, of all his audnors. Hfe voieod
his sentiments in excellent English,
rounding his sentences with a sonorous,
musical voice and impassioned gestures.
"Woman, as a daughter, is the heavenly
flower stolen from Paradise to adorn the
me," he poetically exclaimed. "As the
BRAHMACHARIN BODHABHIKSHU GRATIFIED.
It gives me much pleasure to see how the woman power is working for the good
of humanity in this Western World. It seems that the corruption on the part of the
men in America, due to too much commercialism and consequent thoughtlessness,
is to be remedied by the women.
I have watched very closely since my arrival in this country how men, in order
to make money, have forgotten even the simplest rules of moralityâ how they adver
tise things on the streets, telling wholesale lies, simply to get money; how they
introduce into the market intoxicating liquors and other rubbish and poisons, such as
chewing gum and chewing tobacco, only to corrupt human nature. This makes one
really very sad. Oh, how great is the degradation! When, however, the visitor
looks to the other side of societyâ the circle of ladiesâ hope at once comes to him.
It is indeed gratif ying to see how the ladies are doing their best to spread the cause
of temperance and to save women from the barbarism of men. From these facts it
is quite evident that the woman power is to save America, though at the
same time the woman power has to work here in a way which is
hardly in accordance with the laws of nature, for the woman power il
really the sustaining power of society, like the mother principle of nature. In fact
It is one and the same power which plays the part of the mother both in physical
nature and human society. But in physical nature the power works silently yet
steadily and surely. To be effective it must also net in the same way in human
societyâ silently, gently, but surdy. The main power must work to influence the
Lome. There it is that the woman has to hold the rein of society in her hands as
daughter, sisttr, wife or mother. This is the most natural way.' Unfortunately
however, the woman here has to walk out into the outside world and to cry for
woman's suffrage, so as to check the immoral legislation of men, showing evidently
that she has little influence at home. Had she any she would have hardly any
necessity of going out and cry for a vote. For the legislators are fathers, brothers
husbands , and sons, and the woman could lead them in any way she liked in her
fourfold influence.
However that may be, inside or outside, by natural means or unnatural, it is
the woman power, let me repeat, which will save America.
Therefore, I am glad to see the ladies of California meeting together to discuss
points leading to the good of humanity. I hope they will do so in the real spirit of
selflessness and not only as a show and a fashion.

The afternoon session fiund things
more in readiness and a larger audience
assembled. The morning had been ue
voted to weicoruiiiK the strangers and
mapping out the work. Afternoon found
the worKers ready to begin. "Child Life
and Child Study" was ably discussed by
such well-known and able educators as
Professor T. B. Bailey of Berkeley, Miss
l.ucy M. Wash OQra of San Jose, Kabbi
Nieto and Mrs. Wilson Gould of Oak
land.
The speakers were a bit tardy and the
order ot the programme had to be re
versed, Dr. Nieto -"peaking first instead of.
last as originally arranged. Miss Wash
burn and Rabbi Nieto's address caused
considerable discussion. Rev. Dr. Walk
took exception to accepted ideas and
made a |lea for tlie uncultured parent
and the neglecied child. Dr. Nieto mis
understood Dr. Walk's drift and again
took the platform to make matters intel
ligible. Tnis brought Dr. Walt again on
the stage to explain and a cood-natured,
all-roun 1 explanation followed.
Mrs. Gardener was called upon to tell
about the Mothers' Congress at Washing
ton and graphically describe! the enthu
siasm that prevailed at this famous con
gress.
"CHILD PSYCHOLOGY."
Interesting First Day's Work of
the Fourth Annual Woman's
Conjjr ss,
With a prayer by Rev. Dr. Adams the
I fourth annual Woman's Congress of the
Pa> ific Const Association wa* inaugurated.
To the Rev. Dr. Walk fell the proud
privilege, as he him?elf expressed it, of
j wecoming the coapress. "When the
i ladies first asked me to addrrss them,"
said the reverend gentleman, "I was fully
j conscious of the honor they wished to con
-1 fer upon me. As the son of the first
j Southern clergyman in the Uni;ed States
I who lifted his voice more than thirty
i years a^o in the State of Kentucky in be
j half of equal rights for all and exclusive
i privileges for none, 1 felt I might accep:
! the proud distinction of assisting at the
| fourth annual meeting of the Woman's
I Congress. And X have come with the feel
| ing that every honorab.e effort made for
;he uplifting of woman and of man de
strves my best endeavor, most earnest
prayers and warmest interest-'.
"Let us stand together, and, if it must
j be. fall together. To-day there is no
! loiter a woman's question. It j 9 human
ity's question â the question of equal
rights lor ail, exclusive privileges for
none." Aiter dwtling upon the *Ã¼bjct
of equ.il remuneration for eaual services
j performed. Dr. Walk thus fervent'y con
: cludeil his addre3s: "Welcome to the City
; by the sea. I give you God speed and beg
to assure you that in all your rfTorts 1
pray that the blessings of him rest upon
you."
On behalf of the City, Mayor Phelan ex
tended the hand of welcome to the con
gress and *he visitors from near nn<l f;>r.
As befkied the official representative of
j the peouJe, he dwelt witii longinp praise
i upon the glories o: ;his preat Western
City. He recalled to his auditors that the
great march of civilization is westward
and that the City that made him its of
ficial head is the farthest in the West.
Said the Mayor: "We owe a debt of grati

in contact with distinguished strangers.
It is our duty to extend the hand of iios

ladies themselves for the movement they

Dr. David Starr Jordan, president of
Stanford University, was the next speaker.

In the past women have been acting under
sealed orders, consequently they had to deal
with the lit He things of life; they hud no choice
as to the large ones, so it was uiieu hupposed
that women were frivolous.
It was only the natural result of acting under
sea'ed orders. A woman might have been
one-third noet, but the rest was what chance
and marriace ma<ie her. The spirit of democ
racy Is the breaking ol these orders. The lime
has come for women to think and act for them
selves. Here I may say it would be bitter il
â¢ome men were working under sealed orders
all :he time.
Democracy does a great deal for personal de
velopment. It is making better men and
women, not better government- It is not right
to just do the best one knows how; it must be
the best that it is possible for any one to do.
There has been a great deal of misery caused
by good women who do the best they know
how, butâ they ought to know better. Now
the influence of women is as important at the
work of men.
Mrs. John F. Swift, president of the
Connies , followed Dr. Jordan in an ap
propriate aadress. She said:
Since our last meeting I have been called
npon to preside over this congress owing to
the death of our dear president. Mrs. Sarah B.
Cooper. We bare all sustained a great 10-s
and many o' vi a personal bereavement. It
has been a great privilege to have been associ
ated with Mirh a noble woman in the work of
the congress and mher association*. Si.c was
one of the promoters and organizers of the
Woman's Congress of the Pncitic Coast and
our guide and friend â one o! the purest and
noblest of women. The subject of this con
gress was selected by the late president at the
close of the last one, and we have endeavored
to carry out her plan.
Since the last session of the congress much
has been done toward the end we have in
view, end the prospect of ultimate success is
good. The subject t hi* year is "Education,"
on its broadest lines. Every effort has been
put forth to in".kc this Congress a success by
those in charge, and we hope that you may
carry away to your hÂ«mes much of benefl t and
pleasure from the deliberations of earnest
thinkers here assembled.
Professor T. B. Bailey of Berkeley
opene-i the afternoon session v, ith his
paper on "Child Study and Reverence."
Hi- addiess proved that he spoke from
experienceâ an experience gained by work
in a tield where love held full sway. He
said:
The beginning of child study is in Interest
ing children. We need two virtues in child
studyâ continuity nnii patience. Tne person
who studies children arid givt-s it up not only
has done himself no good, but has done the
children harm. The way to study a child is
to get holJ of its soul, its heart, its mind.
Say to it. "My child, give me your heart."
All who are interested iv child study should
become b^opraphirs. As we must first be
amateur naturalists before we bicome men
fli!<l woruc-u of science so we must become
better mothers, laihyrs, Drothers and sitters
before we en in for scientific en i Id study.
With these two virtues, patience and con
tinuity, tod<>ther with observation and com
paris/ii, tnkiiiK tne chlid as a basis, we should
arrive at splendid results. Love and interest
for chid re n is also necessary. Love without
interest is not wanted. Child study devolops
tact, child study is life. It is part of
the ordinary study of humanity. It
oug'..t to be reverential. To those who
would make the stu<iy of children I
would say, get closer to the children. Woman
is peculiarly fitted for the education of chiN
â¢Ir^n, it !â  said. If this he so, let them show
;lieir unturp.l intuition, their power of love in
influencing other lives, by increasing their
knowledgo of thos3 they can help most. Oniy
by months and yeirs of patient observation
can we accomplish something.
Miss Severence took the platform to dig
cuss this able address of Professor Bailey
and made an earnest plea for the co-oper
ation of teacher and parent.
Mrs. Washburne of Ban Jose read a pa
per on "The Relation of Parents and Chil
dren to School Wurk." Her paper, which
was listened to most attentively, con
tained the following:
My talk has all been made forme, so there
is but little to Bay that has not already been
said. My subject is "Tho Relation of the Pa
rents to Hie hiidren's Work tv 8chool." I
speak of the co-operation so sadly needed iv
our schoolsâ co-operation of the teacner
anJ pnrent. It seems incredible that so few
parents are at all acquainted with the teach
ers of their children. The chi.dren pass from
grade to grade and sometimes right through
the schools without the parents once seeing
any of the teachers.
Thero seems to be a notion that school is
exclusively for the children, and except on
exhiDliion days parents arc rarely seen in the
schoolhouse. This should not be. The parent
nnd the teacher should be on lamiliar terms
always. If a child is not strong do not send
him to school for the whoie session; half a
day is enough. The child may not get through
so soon, but in the end it will accomplish far
more good than it ho wore forced to spend in
doors the time that should be spent in the
sunshine. I Rpenk from experience, for up to
my sixeenth year I went to school only a
naif of each day, and there wns not a day
passed but thai either my mother or father
and sometimes both visited my schoolhouse.
Afu-r Miss Washburne, Rabbi Nieto was
introduced. Ilia paper treated of "The
MoratWraining of Children." He aaid in
part:
A child is not born, as some people assume
with a conscience all ready mnde, but if
healthy nnd with a normal brain, the child
comes into the world with the raw material
out of which it is our duty to construct a con
science.
Never make a promise you do not intend to
keep, n.na always perform what you promise
Do not disappoint without reason ana desirov
â¢ child's natural faith in its parents Trust
begets trust, and if you wish to have confi.
deuce in jour children, to rely upon their
word, le 1 . them be able to rely on you. Never
converse lightly of the absent in the presence
of children; it destroys their respect for the
elders and incidentally for their parent*. A
child has a lense of strict Justice which unfor
luiiaiely is too often blunted by ihosa who
should strive to render it more keen. The
child, though it at first recognizes the mean
ness of adversely criticising those absent
grows used to it after hearing it often.
Mr*. Wilson Gould of Oakland doted
the afternoon **w-on with an address on
"Child Culture." "When wo reach ttie
sacred precinqts of child culture," Mm.
Gould eiplaine4. "Â«e are touching upon
dangerous ground. The problem of proper
child culture implies mother culture,
parent culture, and of that echo an Â«wers,
Where?* Many good women, even in this
day and generation, sneer at the proposi
tion of parent culture, and stand prepared
10 trust all to blind instinct, euphoniously
termed mother's love. But in these days
nothing can escape the searching eye and
trained thought of the scientist, and
mother love and mother intuition must
bear the searching light of science. And
!-o .we see that the day is coming when
motherhood -fiali no longer be recognized
as an Instinct, but as an education per
fected." v
EVENING SESSION.
Child Study In Several Different
Phases Are Elaborated
Upon.
The evening session began with the
reading of a paper by Mrs. Louise Mait
land of Stanford, entitled "The Develop
ment of Children, as Seen in Their Draw-
trig*."
The lecturer exhibited a large number
of colored drawings, illustrating the sub
ject of her paper. From experiments
made by young children in Nebraska
schools it was ascertained that boys are
far be md girls in recognizing colors, and
that the order of preference in colors by
young children ia as follows: Black,
white, red, yellow, blue and orange. Pro
fessor Earl Barnes made experiments w itb
1300 Oakland school-children, which
showed a decided preference for the
brighter colors â red, yellow and blue.
(i. W. Lucky, professor of pedagogy in
the University of Nebraska, ascertained
that the ability to see certain colors is
rery defective in young children. Pro
fesior Joseph Jastro made experiments on
4500 people at me World's Fair between
the ages of 6 and 70 years. Among these
blue was the least selected by those be
tween 6 ana 18 years old. Light red is
preferred by tbo&e below 18 years old.
Children from 6 to 12 years old delight
in laying on bright colors in large masses
without much regard to detail. Realism
begins to assert itself after the age of 12
years.
A very small number of young children
use color realisticaly, and this number in
creases with age.
Miss Grace Barnard read an interesting
paper on "Modifications of the Kindergar
ten System in the Light of Child Study."
One of the ablest papers of the day was
thai of Miss Mary Donnelly, a teacher in
the San Francisco School Department.
The r>apÂ«r was entitled, '"Unconscious
Tuition." She began by saying that it
lay largely in the power of home to make
or unmake the school. Courtesy, patience
ana cheerfulness are the unconscious
teaching of home. The speaker said that
the time was not far off when the home
and the school would be so much alike
that there will .'â â¢ but little transition from
one to the other. Miss Donnelly added :
"Tho teacher's strongest power lies in
her unconscious teaching ; her personality,
which is a Dower for good or for evil that
reaches out into infinity. It is a marvel
that our young folks are as good as they
are when we consider the influence of the
iconoclastic press so often teeming with
slander, vituperation, sensationalism and
maliciouf caricatures."
Professor Earl Barnes of Stanford fol
lowed with a paper on "Children's Ideas
of Punishment."
President Swift advised tbe women in
ttie audience not to wear large hats or
waring plume-* while attending the con
gress â or take them off like a man.
The congress will resume work at 10
o'clock this morning.
WHAT THEY SAY.
Influence of the Woman's
Congress on the Com
munity for Good.
One of the most promising features of
the congress seems to be the absolutely
impartial spirit with which they seek for
and admit evidence from all sides, and
weigh and consider it before they formu
late any general theory. This is a very
pleasing feature, because women are very
often accused of being prejudiced and one
sided. The spirit of dogmatism is ab
sent.
They are asking us to bring our evi
dence before them, as far as we have
worked it out, and let every hearer judgo
for himself or herself.
MRS. LOUISE MAITLAND
of Stanford University.
Women as Te achers.
Women are rapidly coming to dominate
the work of public school teaching. Ninety
per cent of our army of 400,000 teachers
in the United States are women. Judge
Draper, president of the Illinois State
University, says, as a result of long ex
perience, that the greatest weakness in
our American women teachers is their
inability to play a part in public affairs,
to give and take in public discussion in
which lies the very basis of American
life.
Such meetings as this present congress
must do much to correct this weakness,
and if nothing more is accomplished than
to bring to the women engaged in teach
ing, facility in giving and taking in public
affairs tbe present congress will be fully
justified.
PROFESSOR EARL BARNES,
of Stanford University.

ever come to it. It has done more than
anything else I know to brighten the
life of both women and men. It is of
my personal knowledge that a large
number of people are thankful beyond
expression because of the existence of
the congress. People who had been ac

ever since, and they live from year to
year upon the remembrance of the ses

I regard the congress as of vital In

Food for the Mind.
I think that the Woman's Congress
has done wonderful work in the line of
dictating to women, especially to mothers,
the necessity for their taking a lively
interes: in not only the things within
the four walls of home, but the outside
influences which have a direct bearing
upon the safety or the destruction of the
home.
At one time women thought that they
had nothing to do but to get up in the
morning to see that their children's faces
were washed and that they had enough
to eat, without even looking to see what
kind of food was furnished to their
homes. This congress has taught us
that we must know what kind of food
for the mind as well as for the body is
being furnished to our children.

DRUM'S MANLY DENIAL
The Victorious Young Athlete
Repudiates Any Recourse
to stimulants.
He Gives Strong Credit for Berkeley's
Field-Diy Triumph to Man
agers and Trainer.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 26.â Wi1l P.
Drum, who covered himself and his uni
versity with glory at Saturday's great in
tercollegiate field day, is indignant over
the insinuation that bis victory was due
to the use of stimulants. Mr. Drum is
well Known as consistently opposed to the
use of stimulants on any pretext, and his
manly and emphatic denial should set at
rest forever any rumors to the effect that
be had recourse to such extraneous and,
as he deems them, illegitimate spun to
effort. He writes as follows:
Editor Call: In your account of Drum's work
in the California-Stanford field nay on laat
Saturday uppetirs this statement:
"It is to be regretted, however, if true, that
dangerous stimulants were used to force this
young athlete to his utmost speed."
The main statement in this sentence is abso
lutely false. No stimulants were tised by
Drum before nor during nor after the field
day. I beiieve that The Call would not will
ingly lend its columns to the circulation of a
Blunder.
I mii: tit also add that Ido not believe that
any of â  the plucky team that represented
Stanford in the recent contest, and tor whom
our respect is in nowise decreased, would ap
prove 01 this method of depriving an oppoueut
of the credit of his victory.
And. if it is true, as it is elsewhere Implied
In The Call's article, that some of the Stan
ford team were not in good condition, I hope
that next year they may have better managa
ment and trainingâ even to the second best in
the State.
For Berkeley recognizes the fact that to
Manager Barnes and Captain Everett Brown,
who sacrificed themselves lor the sake of the
team, and to their trainer. Al Lean, than
whom there is no better on the coast. Is due
in largest measure the credit of their victory.

EDITOR MARRIOTT
ON HIS DEFENSE
Says He Will Justify the
Alleged Libelous
Article.
Is His Declaration Through
Samuel M. Shortridge, His
Attorney.
Scathing Review of People's Home
Savings Bank Litigation That
Caused This Dispute.
8. M. Shortridge startled Judge J. C. B.
Hebbsrd and his friends yesterday when
he announced in Judge Daineerfield's
court that in the Marriott libel case he
proposed to prove that Judge Hebbard
had not been libeled when the News Let
ter spoke of him as a "creature" and a
"tool" who was a dhgrace to the bench
and who ought not to be elected.
Mr. Shortridge was making his opening
statement to the jury after Judge Dainger
field had denied the motion to dismiss the
charge of libel which is pending against
Editor Frederick Marriott. In presenting
this statement on behalf of his client Mr.
Shortridge gave a detailed history of the
troubles that lea up to the present pro
ceedings. They grew out of the failure of
the Pacific Bank and the People's Home
Savings Bank, both controlled by Dr.
R. H. McDonald and his sons.
The article in question was based on a
statement made by a committee of the
savings bank depositors, in which they
claimed that Judge Hebbard had caused
poor men, widows and orphans to lose
their savings by his unfair acts in main
taining General J. H. Sneehan in the posi
tion of receiver of the savings bank when
it had been proved that the interests of
the depositors were jeopardized thereby.
Mr. Shortriage remarked that the record
here purports to show that the State of
California is the plaintiff, yet as a matter
of fact it will be made to appear that J. C.
B. Hebbard is the complaining witness
and persecutor, and that this actually is
properly a civil suit and not & criminal
proceeding.
The serious accusation that Judge Heb
bard was unfit for the position he sought
would be plainly proved by the records of
the court, and would be sustained and
overproved by oral testimony from the
witness chair.
No malicious intent on the part of Ed
itor Marriott had been proved, and the
detense will show that so far troni there
being any malice, Mr. Marriott did not
write the article, and knew -nothng of it
until after it was published. But even if
he bad known of it, there would be no
difficulty in proving that it was published
from praiseworthy and justifiable mo
tives, such as ought to actuate every hon
orable man in a free country. Further
more, it is a privileged communication,
such as one voter has a right to address to
other voters in discussing the claims and
character of a candidate for office.
The State ou^ht to be compelled to
prove actual malice on the part of a citi
zen publishing bis opinion 01 a candidate
for office before such citizen mar be im
prisoned. The presumption of the inno
cence of tha defendant is established by
law, and must be overcome by the attor
neys for the prosecution before a convic
t.on can be bad.
In determining the question of the un
fitness of Judge Hebbard for the office he
sought, it would be necessary to go into
Judge Hebbard'a record even when he
was a Justice of the Peace. Technically
speaking, he was a qualified Judge, for he
held a position on the bench, but as to
whether he was really qualified for the
place as to his learning, his mental attri
butes, his temper, his disposition to be
partial to hi* friends and those who influ
ence and control bis acts, would be proper
subject of inquiry, said Mr. Shortridge.
An investigation will be made into his
decisions as a Justice of the Peace to see
whether be was guided by reason and
justice or whether he was swayed by petty
spite and paltry considerations. When
Judge Hebbard came to the Superior
Court his record would be examined to see
whether he discharged his duty there as a
broad-minded Judge or whether be acted
more like a small politician in a large
place. \\ nether he was disposed to pur
sue and tmnish men he did not like or to
reward bis favorites.
With a fine touch of humor Mr. Short
ridge referred to the extravagant praise
and the sickening adulation that had
been heaped on Ju<i..e Hebbard by some
of his henchmen. He was by them held
up for the admiration of a staTtled world
in terms more complimentary than had
ever been bestowed on Chief Justice Mar
shall or Lord Eldon. On the other band,
there had been some harsh criticism of
Judge Hebbard, and citizens had as much
right to one form of expression as the
other. Mr. Marriott had only exercised
that right, and no American jury would
send him to jail.
After reading the editorial article on
which the charge of libel was based, Mr.
Shortridge referred specially to the word
"creature," and added: "I may prove
that Judge Hebbard was the creature of
the most immoral 'boss' that was ever
known in San Francisco."
Attorney Julius Kahn, as special coun
sel for the prosecution, objected to Mr.
Sbortridge stating what he "may" prove.

Mr. Kahn wanted to know what he ex*
pected to prove.
In this position Deputy District Attor
ney HinkJe joined, curtly referring Mr.
Shortridge to the language of the com
plaint wben asked for a statement of what
tbÂ« State expected the defendant to jus
tify.
Mr. Shortridge said he rather expected a
parrot-like answer of this kind, so would
not waste time in further inquiries, though,
the defendant was entitled to a manly,
straightforward rey>ly.
In commenting on the failure of tha
McDonald bank- Mr. Shortridge said ho
would show that Judge Hebbard, as pre
siding Judge of the Superior Oourt, as
signed all that litigation to himself, in
order that he might heap the patronage
growing out of the appointment of the
receiver on John F. Siieehan, his personal
and political friend, and that when bis
acts were overruled by the Supreme Court
he appointed the same man, John F.
Sbeehan, to the same place, not only
twice but three time*. Sheehan received,
in round numbers. $20,000 Irom tnose ap
pointments, and finally he was relieved
of all responsibility and his bondsmen
were exonerated without an accounting.
The names on those bonds might throw a
light on the suggestion that Judge Heb
bard was the creature of some person in
this community. One of the bondsmen
was a note ? sta;esman, sometimes known
as Colonel Dan Burns.
It was in this sense that the defendant
would justify the use of the worda
"creature" and "tool," it beine his inten
tion to produce evidence to prove that
Judge Hebbard was either wittingly or
unwittingly used by designing men for tha
accompiis ment of their sinister pur
poses. Mr. Shortridge maintained whether
he knew it or not the fact remains that
Judge Hebbard "stood in" with John F.
Sneehan and his attorneys and associates,
and in that regard had shown himself a
partisan and therefore an unlit person to
occupy the bench as a Judge of ttie Su
perior Court. Mr. Marriott had thought so,
ana as a citizen he had a right to say so.
This being true the jury would be asked
to give an immediate acquittal.
Mr. Sbortridge occupied the afternoon
aei-ion reading documentary evidence.
The taking of testimony will occupy the
remainder of the week.
THE ODD FELLOWS` DAY
Celebration of the 78th Anniver
sary of the Founding of
the Order.
A Brilliant Gathering in Odd Fallows'
Hall in Which the Patriarchs
Militant Wr-re a Feature.
The seventy-eighth anniversary of tha
founding of Odd Fellowship in the United
States was observed last night with a
great deal of eclat in Odd Fellows' Hall by
Oriental Encampment and Canton San
Francisco No. 5, Patriarchs Militant. The
hall, decorated in pale blue and white in
the midst of which stood out prominently
the "all-seeing eye" under tne "three
links," was well filled and the galleries
were crowded. The canton represented
by fifty members in brilliant uniforms
and gay-plumed chapeaus entered the
hall under command of Captain A. J.
Duncan and presented a very fine appear
ance, and after salute broke ranks and dis
tributed themselves over the ball; their
handsome uniforms showing here and
there in the midst of tha handsome gowns
worn by many of the ladies added to the
brilliancy of the scene.
There were present: General J. F.
Crosett and staff. General E. H. Black,
Colonel H. O. Brower, Lieutenant-Colonel
\V. S. Potter, Captain A. J. Duncan,
Grand Treasurer George W. Lemont,
Chief Patriarcn Joe Adams. Captain John
Thompson, District Deputy J. A. Foster,
Assistant Grand Secretary Clifford, Fred
Fillmore, W. J. Phillips. George K. Wil
son, Captain Wilson of Tulare and many
others who are prominent in the order.
The Kebekah lodges wero also well rep
resented. The most notable of these were
Mrs. Mary E. Donoho. grand secretary,
and Mrs. Helene J. Peterson, elected
deputy grand master of District No. 5,
composed of California. Templar, Oriental,
Amity and Loyal lodges. She was ao
companies by her staff of officers.
General J. W. Harris, master of ceremo
nies, introduced Past Grand Master George
H. Morrison, who delivered a short ad
dress of welcome and made a few remarks
appropriate to the day. Then followed
the several numbers on the programme as
announced in yesterday's Call, each be
ing warmly applauded and an encore de
manded.
The ball followed the programme, and
the grand march was led by General Cro
sett and his daughter Lucille.
The refreshment booth was in charge of
the ladies of the Rebekah lodges, and the
proceeds will be divided between the Or
phans' Home and tne other pro rata to
the contingent fund of each lodge.
CRUSHED BY MACHINERY.
John Gomez's It : ghr Leg So Badly Hart
It' Had to Be Amputated,
John Gomez, a lad of 17 years, was
frightfully mangled yesterday morning in
the machinery of the H. J. Layng shops
at 107 Fremont street.
His duties called him to oil tha shafts
every morning, and while doing so yester
day he became tangled so that the ma
chinery tossed him from side to side, and
but for the quick action of the engineer in
stopping the engine he would have event
ually been beaten to death.
As it was, however, his left forearm was
badly shattered and he received a couple
of scalp wounds. His right leg was crushed
and had to be amputated at the Receiving
Hospital.

IHI- CALL &PE-AKS FOR ALL.
To-day the Nation recalls the services of
Grant and does Honor to his memory.
It took New York a long time to erect
the Grant mausoleum, but she has done it
well.
When we have completed Balboa avenue
we will not envy New York the possession
of Riversi Je.
Cleveland's speech at the Reform Club
banquet can be summed up in four words:
It was a croak.
In the meantime Crete is still on the
map even if she does appear to have been
put out of ti.e ring.
The farmers are praying for April
showers, so we might as well look out
for thÂ»ni and expect them any day.
The Mississippi Hoods have broken all
the records, nearly all the levees and most
of the farmers along the river banks, and
atill the rise goes on.
The Kaiser says peace shall be main
tained among the creat powers, and yet,
like the rest of us, perhaps he can't most
always sometimes tell.
The people along the Mississippi should
take to the industry of raisinz ducks and
drakes and enable themselves to be la
the swim when the floods come.
Some people are making fun of the
whiskers of our new Minister to Turkey,
but they may prove useful lo him if he
ehonld ever have to beard the Sultan.
The Senate Finance Committee is not
mnktng much noise on the tariff question,
but it is doing good business and prepar
ing the way for every industry to do like
wise.
If our sympathies ire torn by the con
flicting reports from the war in Greece we
can turn for consolation to the fight in
Cuba. The American favorites are win
ning there.
The success of the Turkish armies in
battle seerus to be due mainly to the skill
of the Geiman officers who direct their
artillery, and rarely has the science of
Germany been worse applied.
It is to be hoped the Washington Port
is correct in saying "Secretary Bliss is
about to de-Hoke Smithiza the Interior
Department." The jib if well done will
have merit enough to justify that phrase
or any other way of putting it.
Pennsylvania has decided to build a
Cnpitol to cost $550,000. and expects to
have it ready in two years' time, and if
she gets off with double the money and
twice the time she may count herself
lucky.
Don't forget that the meetings of the
Woman's Congress will be worth attend
ing. Important subjects are to be dis
cussed, and there are plenty of able and
eloquent speakers in the congress to deal
â with them.
It was Â«aid that Edhem Pasha had been
superseded in command of the Turkish
army, then that he was wounded, and
row lhat he is still to the front and is to
be decorated for his victories. Edhem
seems to be a man of versatility.
As Arthur Balfour attended a meeting
of the British Cabinet wearing a full golf
costume Jerry Simp3on ought not to be
abused for wearing golf stockings in Con
press. The American statesman ia en
titled to a3 much liberty as the Britisher.
The Tammany chiefs have decided to
adopt in New York at the next municipal
campaign the same tactics which the
Democrats used in Chicago, and we shall
Bee whether the gold-brick swindle in
politics can be worked with success twice
inside of a year.
A Pennsylvania statesman has intro
duced into the Legislature a bill providing
that all oleomargarine offered for sale
Etaall be colored deep green, so tbat every
body can recopnize it. The idea is capable
of unlimited expansion. Why not have
a.i adulterated wines, oils and jellies col
ored the same wny?
In magnitude and in greatness of rrnsan
ing the dedication of the Grant monument
in New York to-day will surpass the cele
bration of tlie Queen's reign in London,
and yet many New Yorkers will turn their
b'.cki npon the grand demonstration in
their ow:> city to cross the ocean and pay
a large prtce to see the lesser one abroad.
It is said that during tLo last twenty
five years over 300 monuments to dis
tinguished persons have been erected in
France and committees are now soliciting
money for 127 more. It is not strange
that the art of the sculptor flourishes in a
In:: d of lti*t kind. Even the patience of
the people in receiving favorably so many
eolicitors may be regarded as truly monu
tnrntal.
No recent issue of State concern has no
engaged the minds of tbe people gen
erally as the crusade against adulterated
foo'i?, and the convention to be hela in
this City to devise means for dealing with
the subject will have abundant support If
it devices any practicable plan for ridding
tn of the evil. City and country are at
one on this point, and we shall soon ace
what can be done by a united California
in putting a check to one of the worst de
lects of modern civilization, as tbe adul
tÂ»ration of lood undoubtedly is.
ULYSSES S. GRANT.
The solemn, impressive and patriotic services attending the dedication of the
! Grant monument in New York will attract the attention of the whole people of the
United States to-day. It will he another occasion for manifesting the esteem of the peo
ple for the character of the great commander of the Union armies during the Civil
War and the honor in which his memory is heid throughout the country.
Although General Grant was a hero of a sectional war, the celebration of the dedi
cation of his monument will not be sectional. Men who served under Lee will take
part in the procession to-day and march with the men who served under Grant Pub
lic sentiment in the South will be responsive to that of the North, and there will be
no trace or suggesiion of bitterness remaining from former hostilities and war between
thÂ« sections in thr^e services which are designed to do honor to the great commander
who led the Union army to victory, and maintained the supremacy and integrity of
the Union in the tierce strife which divided the sections in the past.
The honor to be paid to General Grant on the part of the people of the Northern
States is not widely different from that which has been given to great military lead
ers in other nations. Men of all countries and of all ages have delighted to honor
those who maintained the success ot their arms and achieved for them triumphs in
the battles in which they were engaged. The presence of Southern men in ihe pro
cession, however, and the thousand manifestations of Southern admiration for tne
great hero of the wnr for the Union is something different to what the world has
hitherto seen, and is a striking illustration of the completenees of the success of the
Union army. It is an unmistakable evidence that General Grant not only conquered
the arms ot the South but won the beartt of her people, and is as illustrious in peace
as in war. \
In all the eulogiums that will be spoken concerning Grant to-day there will be
nothing said with which the people are not already familiar. His character has been
long studied, and much has been said and written concerning it by men of the Highest
eloquence with tongue and pen among our people. He therefore needs no praise at
this time, nor any orator, however eloquent, to bear witness to the American people
concerning his services to the Union or the nobleness of his personal character.
The people of the United State?, in the South as well as in the North, have come
to regard this hero of Appomartux, w.o at the cose ot the war expressed his own
policy in the statement, "Lot us have peace," as in the truest sense an ideal American.
AÂ» he represented the ardent intensity of Northern patriotism during the war and
ihe fnll force of Northern resolution to preserve the Union, so also he represented
after the war was over the desire for a complete restoration of an era of good feeling
between the hostile sections. He was no believer in a nation held together by
bayonets. He desired a union of hearts a3 well as of lands, and t lie latter years of his
life were consecrated to the purpose of bringing about the great resu t.
The tomb in which his body lies on Riverside avenue in New York will share with
that of Mount Vernon and that of Springfield the honor of the American people. It
is a great and noble mausoleum which New York has erected to this great and noble
man, and it will be long tha shrine toward which American pilgrims will make
their way. â¢
CREAMERIES IN CALIFORNIA.
A rapidly gathering industry which
hitherto has failed to attract a.iy con
certed attention from the State press is
that of the establishing of creamerits
tnrougbout California. There have been
creameries in California for a number of
years, but lately the number has increased
at a pace which makes the toinl at the
present time a rather astonishing one to
contemplate.
There are something like 250 estab
lished and in lull running order, while
additional ones are in view in Red
Bluff, Watsonville, Soledad, Lodi, Mon
terey and other places. In fact, tne in
crease of these butter and cheese factories
has been so prominently forced upon pub
lic attention that the last Legislature took
particular cognizance thereof and enacted
some cast-iron laws for the direction of the
industry upon proper lines, looking prin
cipally to the maintenance of purity in
the products. Tne State Dairy Lureau
has been authorized and instructed to
furnish free of cost to those who apply in
writing certain molds with the imprint of
legalized brands to fit the various pre
scribed kinds of cheese whicii they are
permitted to turn out under the pure-food
clause.
Noting the full significance of this tidal I
wave of cream, the Western Creamery rises ;
to assert that this State Has no longer any
practical reason lor importing either but
ter or cheese, and it would seem that its
assertion is just. There is quite as much
of the principle of protection in the
patronizing of local industries such as the
creamery movement, to the exclusion of
outside products which are scut In and >
offered side by side with the home prod- i
ucts, as there is In the passing of laws to
keep outside proiucls from comine in.
In the present case ibis kind of protection
is so obviously feasible and opportune
that no one who claims to be a protection-
ist can consistently ignore it. Our house
wives may become protectionists to a very
practical degree by following this ele
mentary principle and insisting on hav
ing butter and cheese of California manu
facture.
RIVERSIDE AND BALBOA.
The dedication of the Grant monument
on Riverside avenue to-day will call pub
lic attention to the beauty of that grand
avenue and prove the wisdom of the city
of New York in devising it and carryine
it out to a completion so perlect in every
respect. New York will be honored as
much for the grand driveway which she
has constructed as for the greet monu
ment which stands beside it, and the peo
ple throughout the country will be forcibly
reminded of the importance of such thor
oughfares to all great and enterprising
communities.
It is natural that from this attention to
Riverside drive the minds of the peo
ple of San Francisco should revert to the j
great avenue which is being constructed
at home. Balboa avenue can never be- i
come to ban Francisco exactly what River
side is to New York. Tne configuration
of the two cities and the relation of the 1
two driveways to the genera! plan of the
municipality are too widely different for â 
them ever to become much alike in Ren- |
erÂ«l respecti. Nevertheless tliey have these !
points in common, that each constitutes
the most picturesque driveway of the
community to whicn it belongs, and each
is accounted as one of the chief orna
menls of its city.
New York has fairly completed River
! side avenue to the extent originally de
signed, and is now talking of extending
it. Snn Francisco has but begun Balboa
. avenue. The New Yorkers are realizme
j benefits and pleasures which with us are
j only to be looked for in the future. The
1 success attained there will be a stimulant
to us to rapidly advance the work here.
; When we read of what has been accom
-1 plished in New York we will have new in
ducements to subscribe money to the Bal
boa-avenue fund so that the work can be
prosecuted vigorously and the avenue
I opened as speedily as possible.
Until we have completed this work
j urgent solicitations for contributions to
the fund to defray tb* cost will be always
in order. The Call has iterated and re
j iterated the importance of the enterpriso
in tbe past and will continue to do so un
'il complete success has been attained.
j The amount of money now noetled is com
paratively small, and every dolinr con
tributed maKes it just so much less. Let
us not balk in the work at this point. Let
us go. forward and open that driveway
which, while inferior to Riverside in some
respects, will be so far superior to it in
others that we can rightly challenge the
metropolis of the East to a comparison.
-
Tbe eagerness with which David Ben
nett Hill is engaging in the task of re
organizing the Democratic party in New
York may be merely the result of a rest-
Jess spirit, but, all the same, it looks like
iin attempt to get himself into a position
from which he can make another jamp for
the Senate before the world forgets Uim.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 27, 1597.
CLEVELAND'S SPEECH.
The much advertised New York Reform
Club banquet has taken place, the long
expected speech of Grover Cleveland on
â¢Present Problems." has been delivered,
and the people who were waiting with
curiosity for the outcome have found
themselves in the position of those who
watched the mountain in labor and saw it
bring forth a ridiculous mouse.
If the banquet was designed to advance
the prestige of the Cleveland wing of the
Democratic party, or to lay the founda
tion for a campaign for the re-election of
Mr. Cleveland to the Presidency, it has
wholly failed. Nothing was said at the
banquet of sufficient importance to live in
the memory of those who read it even for
a single day, and beyond the general de
nunciation of the supporters of Mr. Bryan
and the administration of McKinley, the
great mass of the American people could
not recall this mornuig anything of Mr.
Cleveland's speech which they read on
Sunday.
'1 lie solo effect of the address of the ex-
Pres.dent seems to have been to give occa
sion to tlie verbose Mr. Bryan to write |
another letter, and to the irrepressible
Henry Watterson to reutter with his
usual wit and vindictiveness his hostility
to Cleveland, Clevelandism and all that
appertains to the "cuckoo" party. These
responses to the address may have added
something to the amusement of the
people, but beyond that Mr. Cleveland
effected nothing by the ponderous plati
tudes which he so seriously read to his
admirers at the banquet.
If Ihe Cleveland faction of the American
people can achieve nothing more exciting
or stimulating than what was put forth at
the New Yurk meeting, we may account
the possibility of the reappearance of Gro
ver Cleveland as a serious factor in our
politics as not only out of the ll*t of possi
ble dangers but among ihe least of our
public annoyances. There is no possible
cnance that such orations and such senti
ments as emanated from the banquet can
nave the least effect upon the American
people, other than that of increasing their
weariness with Cleveland and his party.
The issues of politics to-day and for the
future are to be made up by the McKinley
administration and that wing of the Dem
ocratic party which supported Bryan dur
ing the campaign and is now represented
in Congress It is the issue between con
strvatism and radicalism, between protec
tion and free trade, between genuine bi
metallism and the Mexicanizalion of our
currency, between the statesmanship
which is represented by McKinley and all
the cirut'.c vagaries which are advocated'
by Bryan. Mr. Cleveland la out of poii- |
tic?. We have seen the last of the cuck- j
oos, and the speeches made at the Reform â¢
Club banqu-t have passed into the list of
speedily forgotten funeral oraiions.

that a love of candy is not a proof of lunacy.
It was in the case of Amanda E. Mackintosh,
who wanted to have her marriage with John

that the defendant was insane at the time of
his marriage. This the court denied her, al
though she averred that one of the symptoms
of meutal aberration of the defendant was
that he used to sit alone for hours at a time
before his marriage eating candy, of which he
seemed never able to get enough.
WHAT HAS NEW GREECE LONE?
The weakness of old Greece was its lack of
unity. Tnis new Greece, arisen since 1823,
has been fu-ed in a terrible furnace, wilics
Charles D. Roberts in the UluMratea Ameri
can. It has acquired homogeneity. Its crav
ing for racial unity will never rtst umatifrfieJ.
Greeks are no more Spartan. Athenian, The
ban, Samiau, they are only Greek. In three
quarters of a century of new life what
has been accomplished by that clipped
faction of them which the powers per
mitted to constitute the kingdom of Greece?
It has lifted itself from the slough of four cen
turies of bondage to an advanced and efficient
civilization. Ii has shown that the arts of
self-government survived ta the blood. It hns
even, miraculous as ti may seem, set itÂ»eli in
the forefront of tin* nations at standing for a
principle in scorn of odds, as daring to chal
lenge alone a gigantic iniquity which others
were too coldly prudent* to engase.
Athens, seventy-live years ago a squalid

An Appeal for the Greeks.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir:' In taking the liberty to appeal to the benevolent
hearts of our citizens, especially to the ladies of California, I know that many appeals in be
nalf of good causes have been made of late. But none has been of greater Importance than the
cause of the heroic peoplo of Greece struggling in a tremendous war against the most barbar
ous power of Europe, the Turkish empire, which is assisted by the so-called great powers, or
rather by their rulers. r .iV:
Greece, once the cradle of civilization, originated the law systems of the civilized countries,
formed regulated states, which even to-day stand as the unexcelled work of great statesmen.
Her skill in arts, especially poetry, sculpture, architecture, et al., are the fundamental stones
of studies of scientists and artisans in our days.

Elrenia was tovred into port by the steam
schooner Protection yestcraay and was
anchored off the seawall in a water-logged
condition. She is a complete wreck and
will never go to sea a^ain. The K.venia
sailed from Caspar for San Pedro on
April -i with 180,000 feet ot redTood lum
ber. At the time a fair easterly wind was
blowing and all the conditions seemed
good for a successful trip.
"When close inshore an anchor was
dropped, but the weight, holding the E:
venia steady fora few moments only, be
gan to drag," said Captain Johnson yes
terday. "A heavy swell was running anJ
it carried the schooner rapidly toward the
beach.
"The Etvenia struck the rocks and tore
away her rudder and sternpo^t. the
slewed around slightly and held fast. The
crew then got an anchor astern and hove
i he vessel off the rocks, but she was leak
ing badly and seemed to be severely
strained. The lumber in her hold was a.l
tnat kepi her afloat.
"The second anchor dragged, and for a
second time the schooner traveled land
ward on the cr*Â«t of a bis? swell. SShe
struck heavily, smashing in her bottom
planks and sending her main and fore
mast over tLe side. The vessel was a
complete wreck and was temporarily aban
doned by the crew. Wr.en the swell was
less heavy the nulk was hove off the rocUs
for the third time and made fast to a
luiy. The Protection, Captain Ellefr-en,
tlien took hold of her and towed her to
li.i- City."
Nearly half the load of lumber was lost,
and on it there was no insurance. There
is $IW3 insurance on the ball. The
Elvenia was built at Humboldt in 1872.
biie is 140.99 tons net burden, ana is o wised

ru:i in the hard sand in Oak'rand Creek,
and the lumber discharged into huhters.
Owners of gasoline schooners u;e very

Two of the boats have already been with
drawn and others will follow in rapid suc
cession. J. S. Kirn ball, wi o was tne first
to introduce \ln* kind of craft into t be
roasting trade, is very much incensed over
the matter. l lt is class legislation," he
said, "and looks as thou?h Congress \rs;j
trying to do all in Its power to ruin me
shipping trade of the country.
'â¢According to the new rules each of
these small boats must carry a licensed
captain and licensed first mate, a licensed
engineer and a licensed assistant engi
neer. Then on top of that we cannot
carry passe ngers l-ecanse we use gasoline,
and that, they rule, is carrying combusti

as soon as she gets in from this run.
There iÂ« no danger from the use of gaso

introduced until the present there has
never been an accident."
It is understood that an appeal for the
niouiheation of the present rulings will
be made to the Supervising Inspectors.

The Investigation of the
Yaquina Wreck by
Inspectors.
Captain H'nkle aod Others Tell
How She Struck at
Hueneme.
Sudd.'Q Fomation oor. r a H thertc Ua
known Smcbir On? Hundred
F.-st From the W.iarf
United States Local Inspectors Phillips
and Bohl yesterday took testimony in the
matter of the wreck of the Yaquina on
April 11 this year.
Captain C. E. Hintle, master of the ves
sel, testified that the steamer Coos Bay, i
which draws thirteen fret of water as
against fourteen feet draught of tiie Ya
quina, stopped at Huenerne wharf the day
before the Yaquina arrived there ana did
not strike the bar, Dut he touched it when
backing out for tbe return trip. Ships
! had been ir. the habit of eoing right up to
i the wharf and had never experienced any
! difficulty in doing so.
When the Yaquina grounded on the
sandbar she was 100 feet outsido of the
end of the wharf, heading directly for the
I wharf. !?he stopped when she struck and
j pounded three or four times, and Captain
! Hinkle backed up at full speed. At that
I time the steamer was approaching very
I cautiously and stopped when she touched
the sandbar. The witness found out aftir
! ward that there was ten feet of water at
j the wharf. The water poured into the
I vÂ«sÂ«el'!< hold at a great rate and the en-
I gines failed to wort, so that it was not
| possible to get tliÂ© st6a>ner Yaquina into
, deep water. She had 240 tons ot' canto on
i bourd and was valued at about $15,000.
The atTnlavit of C. B. Greonwe 1, for the
I past ten years wharfinger at lluenemr,
was read. He said a sandbsr hud sud
denly formed at a point 100 feet from the
\ end uf tne wharf and that its existence
j was unknown to him until after the wreck
j of the Yaquina.
An affidavit, was read also from D. T.
Perkins, for seven years superintendent oi
the warehouse at Htienenie. He said tue
Pacific Coast Steamship Corspany's steam
ers had oeen land.ng there lor four days
before the wreck, and had not discovered
the b.sr.
Cl. li. Whitney, hrst mate of the YÂ«
quina, Miid the vessel bumpÂ«>i four or live
j times and bej;an to take in water rapidly.
I He had never Known of the existence of
th<" sandbar.
G. D. Parson", master of the Eureka.
testifi d that his vessel uad just grazed
I bottom where the Yaquina struck. The
! water at that point vuried in depih and is
I treacherous. Ti.e bar was o! recent occu
rence, and might disappear when the
spring freshets Ktibsiilcd.
W. H. Picrson, engineer of the Yaquina,
testified that the '-shoe" of the vessel
locked the wheel, and the engines Â«ould
not work after the vessel struck.
Tho inspectors took the matter under
advisement.

IS IT FOR CHARITY?
The Tollce Are In ventignt in X a Scheme
Promoted by Private Detective
Mullen.
The police are investigating the motives
that prompted C. A. Mullen, a private de
tf ctive, to place glass receptacles in a lar>:e
number of saloons for donations to be di
vided among the "Associated Hospitals"
in tne City.
Detcc iveo Gibson and Wren were de
tailed by Captain Bohen yesterday after
noon to visit the saloons and instruct the
proprietors not to hatul ever the recepta
cles to Mullen or any one representing
him until Chief Lee< had an ffportuntty
of investiKtt'iug the matter. When Mol
ten hamie 1 the receptacles to the differ
ent saloon-keepers he told them that iiii
wife was detoteJ to charitable purposes
and she had taken that means to 'urti.er
hrr ends.
It is claimed that none of the hospitals
in tue City authorized Mullen to collect
money for them, either personally or
through glass receptacles, but the detect
ives have nol yet seen the uili ials of these
institutions.
Mullen arrived in the City from Brook
lyn, N. V., four or live months ago and lie
broufcut with h-m a letter of introduction
from the Chief uf Police there to Captain

MINING STOCKS
CAUSED HIS RUIN
Cripple Creek's Defaulting
City Clerk Is in
Town.
Marshal P. Eales Will Return
W.th Him Probably This
Mm ing.
HurJ Frankly Ackcow!edg?s His
Crime and Kerry Feels His
Pos tion.
Marshal P. Eales of Cripple Creek, Colo.,
arrived at the City Prison yesterday aftei
noon with Joseph T. Hard, the defaulting
City Clerk of that municipality. Thi>
Marshal is on his way to Cripple Creefc
with HurJ and will probably leave this
morning.
Hurd wr.s arrested in Sonoma County
by Marshal Orr and was taken from
Cloverdak' to the County Jail ut Sauta
RoÂ«a Sunday morning.
He is a man of education and refine
ment and feels hi* position keenly. He is
a native of Canada, :?S years of age and
held important positions on the leading
Eastern newspapers before settling in
Cripple Creek. Hefore his election as City
Clerk he was connected with a Colorado
uews, aper.
He spenks frankly of his fall from grace
and attributes it to his infatuation lor
gambling in mining stocks.
"Just before the Presidential election
last November,' he said yesierdav, "1 put
all the money I had on hand and all I
could borrow into minir.e stocks, expect
ing that after the elections stocks would
go up in value.
"Contrary to my expectation stocks de
clined and I :oo!isnly took about $2000 of
the City funds to meet the deticieticy.
vainly hopinc that a turn in the wheel of
fortune would come to help me out of my
ditiiculties.
â 'Nothing of the kind happened, and
realizing that I would go out of office in a
shori time and could only corer up my
defalcation until my term expired, 1 took
$2000 of the City's funds and fled.
"My original intention was to make my
way to Ja; an, but afier arriving hero I
changed my mind and decided to take to
the mountains, and here 1 am."
Â£p?aki'ig of his urre-t by JMamhal Orr
he nimed that if he had been nrni'-d ;â  <â¢
Marshal would not hnve pot him without
a lit: lit, but he philosophically concludes
now that it was'oetier he was unarmed.
He has been married sewii years and
.-ay* he never had any family troubles.
His downfall wa> <lue solely to his iniatu
alion for speculating in minim storks.
When Hurd was arrested $890 was found
in is pocketf. H<> told Marshal Eiles
that he had given $500 to E. P. Atkinson,
tue Pullman conductor on the train from
Ogden.
Hurd reiterated the statement last
night. Ho said: "The conductor took me
for a Pinkerton man and kept his eyÂ«
upon me. When I went to sleep he |
opened mv gripsack and searched through .
it, but found no papers to give him a clew â 
10 my id entity. He examined me closely â 
ns I ->!ei't and noticed that I wore a wig. I
Then he searched through my clothes '
and found a false mustache in my vest- i
pocket.
"Next morning he told me that I wns a
fugitive from justice, and hinteu that he
could deliver ma up. I naw that denial
would be useless, and as he might carry
out bis threat* 1 told him I \rould give
him $300 to get me safely out of the coun
try. He told me he could not do that, but
he could give me some cood advice which
â would bÂ« worth the (500, and I gave him
the iiiim .Hi in five f 100 Liils.
"It was through his advice that I laft
ttie traia at Sui-un and went over the
mountains to Calistoga. "
Maraliai Eales and Detective Reynolds
saw Conductor Atkinson at bis residence,
111 Alpine street, last nieht. Atkinson
emphatically denied that llurd ha<l given
htm any money, and if he saia 90 he was
not telling the truth, adding that bis
word should bi takon in preference to thai
of an embezz er. He admitted that be
>jw Uurd on '.be train and talked with
him a good deal on usual topics, but not
a cent passed between them.

United Slates Judge Mor
row Rendered a Deci
sion to That Eff?ct.
Six Thousand Dollars Damages
Awarded to an Injured
Stevedore.
Employers Must Care for the Safjty
of Tiieir Hired Help or Be
Mulcted.
United States Judge Morrow rendered a
very important decision yesterday morn
ing in the case of Jens P. Jensen against
the ship Joseph B. Thomap, J. F. Chap
man and others, to recover $10,000 damages
for injuries received by Jensen caused by
a keg falling upon him through a hatch
way, while Ue was working in the hold as
a sievedore.
Judge Morrow's opinion shows prodi
gious research, and foots up 12,000 words,
most of the space being taken up with
references to a wide range of authorities
settling similar points of disputes in other
case*.
It was set up in the defense of the case
that the keg had been tipped into the
hatchway by another stevedore, and not
by a member of the ship's crew. The court
after summarizing the testimony pro
ceeded to say :
I conclude, therefore, that it was one of
these young men, and not one of the steve
dores, who stepped on the hatch-covers, up
setting the keg, and in no view of the case can
the act of tipping the ha ch-cover and causing
the keg to roll Into the hatchway be construed
as the act of a ieilow-servant. But it is imma
terial, in my opinion, whether the person who
stepped on the batch-cover was one of the
young men connected with the vessel or
whether it was one ot the stevedores, if the
act of placing the keg at the huch-cover to
dry was a failure to observe ordinary care, or,
in other words, was culpable negligence on the
part of those connected with the vesÂ«el. For
it is no defense in an action for a negligent in
jury that the negligence of a third person, or
mi inÂ«vitable accident, or an inanimate thing,
contributed to cause the injury of the plain
tiff, if the negligence of the defendant was the
efficient cause of the injury. (It) American
and English Encyclopedia ana cases there
ciied.)
In Benjamin vs. Metropolitan street Rail
way Company (MÂ»>. Sup.), 34 H. \V. 590, it was
held that where the plaintiff was injured by
the tilting oi ttie cover of a manhole main
tained by the defendant in the sidewalk in
front of hi;: premises, tlie fact thta au inde
pendent contractor, who aelivered roal to the
defendant, negligently failed to replace the
cover properly will not relieve defendant
irom liability if the negligent construction <>i
the cover directly contributed to plaintiff's
injury.
I'nder these ru es of law the important in
quiry, manifestly, ta whether the ac-, by those
in cncrge ot the vessel, in placing the keg on
the hatcn-covers to dry at such close proximity
to the hatchway was "negligence, and whether
such negligence concurred with the accidental
tipping of the haich-uovers to produce the in
jury to the libe;ai.t. To es:ablis!i the defend
ant's liability his negligence need not neces
sarily hÂ»ve been the immediate cause of the
injury; provided it be a substantial pnrt of
the cau^e he will be none the less liable be
cnuse the injury may have been contributed
to by the intervening negligence of a third
pergon.
Judge Morrow quoted to the same effect
n large number of authorities, and con
cluded by calling attention to the severity
of tbe Injuries received by Jensen. His
| skull was iraciured by the blow, resulting
| in paralysis and permanent injury of a
very grave character.
The court added: "I think that under
all the circumstances of tbe case, and par
i ticnlarly in view of tbe fact that his earn
ing capacity hai been destroyed, the libel
-1 ant shouldbe allowed the gross sum of
| $15000. A d cree in that amount will be
! entered in lavorof the libelant withcosti."

perhaps you have never seen

The reasons are :
(1) you insist that your

(2) you don't know what
extract can be ;
(3) your grocer doesn't
quite dare ask you to pay more
for extracts ;
(4) last but not least, your
grocer makes more money on
the watery sort, and sells it to

commanding her to appear before thÂ« Jus
tice at 2 o'clock and explain whether or
not she has anything to satisfy a judg
ment for f^so, obtained by J. J. Raver.
The necessity of Mrs. Dimond's appear
ance in court grew out of her connection
with one Mcore, who passed as her mana
ger in the theatrical world.
Mrs. Dimond, alter the divorce, an
nounced her intention of going on tho
stajje, believing that the notoriety she
had received in connection with the di
vorce case would advertise her sufficiently
to pain lucrative engagement?. She gave
Aloore a promissory note for $250 to coyer
certain expenses incurred, ranking it
payable at any bank in San Francisco
within sixty days of its date.
Either engagements did not materialize
or Mrs. Dnnor.d changed her mind, for
the note was not paid and Moore sued
through the collector. The case went to
the plaintiff by default, and now the ex
manaeer proposes to find out whether
Mrs. Dimond nas anything with which to
satisfy the claim. Airs. Dimond, when
served with the order, said that if she was
forced to take the stand she wouid tell
some interesting matters concerning her
proposed theatrical career that would
cause a sensation. She declared that
Moore's action was taken because she had
refused to retain him as manaeer.

Salaxar, Past the Wire.
Race-goers to Ingleside yesterday were
treated to a miid sort of a surprise in the
way of seeing a 200 to 1 shot in the betting
stop over the finishing line first. Don
Gara, a colt owned by Mrs. A. Archer,
whose string of victories is about as long
as an Englis-h | u^ dog's nasa! appendage,
won tbo third race on the card at these
long odas. Outside of one fortunate specu
lator he was scarcely nibbled at in the
ring, and after opening at 100 went to 200
to 1. He was secend to Emma D into tlie
stretch and then, gradually forging ahead,
beat the roan mare out a neck, covering
the six furlongs in I:lsJÂ£. Olive finished
third, with the 9 to 20 choice Mobalaslta
back in the ruck.
Of the other events decided, favorites in
the betting took three. The day was cold
and foggy, which militated against very
fast time, though the track wai in fair
condition.
Fashion Plate, a filly by Racine, carry
ing Joe Harvey's colors and 50 to 1 in the
belting, came within a short bead of land
ing the openine event tor maiden three
year-olds. Rufalba, with Willia Martin
up, was a consistent 6 to 5 favorite
throughout the betting, but never looked
dangerous during the running. Fashion
Plate led all the way, and after tiring
about a furlong from the wire, came again
and was beaten out the narrowest of
margins by the 2% to 1 second choice
Fiorlmel, carrying the Spreckels colors.
The six-fur:ong selling run that fol
lowed looked a gift for Perhaps with
Shaw in the saddle, yet he was allowed to
drift back in the betting from 3 to 5 to
even. The brown gelding led from the
jump, winning easily ai the finish, a
length ahead of Doubtful, the second
choice. Jack Martin, a 12 to 1 shot, run
into *ho\v.
Willie Martin piloted the even|money
choice Cabrillo to victory in the fourth
race decided, a mile and a sixteenth run,
under selling conditions. Taking him at
once to the iront, he never relinquished
the lead and parsed the judges a nock in
advance of San Marco, with Morte Fonse
tii rd a head further away. The time,
I:-*:* I ,', was fast, considering|tho unfavor
able climatic conditions.
The starl to the next event, a six-fur
lone sprint, was an unfortunate one,
Palmerston, Howard and Major Cook be
ing left at the post. Strathrol, the 4to 5
choice, wÂ»? away first, and making all the
running won easily from Una Colorado, a
15 to 1 shot excellently ridden by Patsy
Freeman. Midas, well played at long
odds, finished third.
Tne tinal five-furlong scramble was cap
tured by the Burns and Waierhouse entry,
Elsmore, at sixes in the betting, which
ouisprimed the even money favorite, Rey
Salazar, at the last furlong and won
handily by less than a length in 1:03*.^.
Siva, a 15 to 1 shot, was a good third.
NOTES.
The number of bookmakers wtighing in
was reduced to fourteen yesterday. They
were not overburdened with business.
Eddie Ames rode a very good race
astride Don Gara and should be able to
get more mounts in future.
Joe Harvey increased hs bank roll con

CHINESE GAMBLERS.
Another Ingenious Point in Their Favor
Sprang Upon Judge JoachinmtD,
Judge Joachimsen is haying novel
points sprung upon him in regard to
Chinese gambling cases.
Attorney Richards, in the case of Woo
! Bing, charged with visiting a gambling
j place at 815 Washington street, argued
: some days ago that it must first be proved
! that the place was a gambling-house and
! second that the person went there for the
| purpose of earn bunt:.
Tne Judge decided that the point was
not well taken, in view of recent decisions,
and ordered Woo Bing and forty-five
others to appear for sentence to-day, when
appeal papers will iiicely be filed.
Yesterday Attorney C. J. Campbell, in
i the case of Ah Poy, cnargpil with visiting
I a gambling place at 12, r > Waverly place,
: sprang another point upon the Judge,
i which he has tauen some days to think
I over.
Attorney Campbell contended that sub
division 3 of section 33 of the ordinance
1587, under which the arrest was made, was
unreasonable and void, ma-much as it
made the penalty for visiting the same as
for keeping or maintaining a gamollng
house. lie quoted numerous decisions in
support of his contention.
The subdivision reads that any person
keeping, maintaining or visiting any place
for the purpose of gambling is liable upon
conv.ction to a fine not exceeding $r>oo or
imprisonment for six months, or by both.
Affection TVmÂ» a I'oor Collateral.
Andrew J. Weir is on trial in Judge Wal
lace's court, charged with obtaining $200 by
false pretenses from Louise Peter, an unsophis
ticated German girl. Although a married
man, Weir made love to the young woman,
and she says he promised to marry her. In
order to show thai nis Hff..-ctioa was recipro
cated, she <aye him all her money. Several
of his love-letter* were read to the jury. They
were exceedingly affectionate m tone and
greatly interested Mrs. Weir, who was present
in court. Further testimony will be heard to
day.

Supervisor Smith Wan s Quincy-

to Fall Into DfCky.
Mayor Phelan came out first best in his
tilt with District Attorney Barnes over
the hiring of assistant counsel at the
nveiing of the Board of Supervisors
yesterday. His veto of Attorney James
J. Dunne's appointment was upheld al
most mi â ii!:m<.'ii ly au I the authorization
for services already performed was also
sustained.
The Mayor made the following reply to
the recent letter of District Attorney
Barnes in relation to the employment of
special counsel:
.. San Francisco, April 24, 1897.
. To the Honorable th, Hoard of Svpirvisor* of
the City and Cnunty of San l-'ranciscjâGentle
men: Jn his liter of April 17, ihe District
Attorney, in jusliiication ol his demand for
special assiatau counsel, lays that tlio Board
of Supervisors is authorized to provide add
tional assistance to the various departments
ot the municipal government and that this
power has beea conspicuously exercised In
Uie matter ot the Assessor's ottice, the Recor
der's cflice, the County Clerk's office, etc. I
find that this as done by rxpreu i-tati'tory
enactment. (See act of March 30, 1872, and
act ol March 9tt, 1595. )
The cases cited by the District Attorney nave
no application to the matter before us, for tne
reason that they affirm the right of Boatus of
Supervisors to employ additional counsel in
civil matters and not Id criminal enses. In
the case of Modoc County vs. encer & Raker
(103 Cal., 4!Â»8). decided in 1894. |tbe Supreme
Court held that "Boards of Supervisors are
creatures of the statute, and the authority for
any act on their part must be sought In the
statute"; that "unaer the county government
act Boards of Supervisors have no power to ,
employ counsel on behalf of the county to
prosecute or assist in the prosecution of crim
inal cases prosecuted in the name or on behalf
of the people of the Slate," and that the "al
lowauce by the Board ol Supervisors to attor
neys for asÂ»iÂ«iiiig in the prosecution of crim
inal cases is void, and creates no legal claim
against the county."
In this connection I desire to call your at
tention to the fuct that ihe payment of the
salary oi the Assistant District Attorney,
allowed by the last Board of Supervisors lor
sixteen months, terminating January, 1897,
and amounting to; 4000, was paid according
to this decision in violation of law. The court
in the case cited above says that the couuty
has no concern as to tin- prosecution of
criminal cases, and if the District Attorney
needs ass stance he must call on the Attorney-
General under section 470 of the Political
Code.
As to the prosecution of pure food cases I
wouid remind your honorable board that you
have employe<i*in the I'oiire Courts lour pros
ecuting attorneys at $3000 a yÂ«ar each and
four assistant prosrcuung attorneys, whose
duty it is generally to prosecute all such cases,
and that a demand for special counsel is a
rcllectiou upon their competency and upon
the wisdom of your selection.
The board completed its vote of confi
dence to the Mayor by sustaining two
vetoes of privileges granted shopkeepers
to extend their show-windows over the
sidewalks.
Supervisor Delaney introduced a resolu
tion turning over the $3000 appropriated
for the celebration of independence day
to the boulevard fund, out it was objected
to by Supervisors Bntt and Lackmann,
who thought that the celebration of July
4 should be fostered in every way, an d
that if the City wanted 10 contribute to
tne boulevard expenses it should do so in
some other way.
It was suggested that perhaps the
transfer would not be legal, and tue mat
ter was finally referred to the Finance
Committee.
Mark Lane presented a vigorous protest
again-t the fund being diverted from the
purpo-e for which it was originally in
tended. He declared that the safety of
the Republic rested on keeping alive the
fires of patriotism and Jove of country in
the hearts of its citizens, particularly the
rising generation, and that evrry fire
cracker if not every grain of powdei used
on Independence day performs iti office
in keeping up precious patriotism.
A resolution permitting alterations and
repairs to a building on Bacon place, for
merly Quincy street, brought a strong
i rotest irom Supervisor Smith. He de
clared that no improvements of any kind
should be permitted on houses used for
the purposes Quiccv-s-reet structures are
used, saying tliat they -hould be allowed
to decay as early as possible. They
were a disgrace to the City, he said, and
their owners should not be civen any en
couragement. Supervisor Rottanzi took a
hand in the discussion, and then Super
visor Delaney moved that the entire mat
ter be postponed for one week. He stated
that some cnanges in the names of streets
were contemplated and that Bacon place
might be renamed Rottanzi street. The
matter was postponed a week.
The board voted to past Supervisor
Rottanzi's high-hat ordinance to print,
but Supervisor Smith gave notice of a re
consideration, wuich bars the progreis of
the measure for the time being.
Proposals for printing delinquent tax
lists wern submitted as follows: Evening
Post 41 14 cents per naraa, Report 8 cents
per name, Bulletin 7 2-5 cents per name.
Bids were referred to the Printing Com
mittee.
The matter of permitting the erection
of high fences about town for advertising
purposes was referred to the City and
County Attorney for a legal ODinion on
the question.

A Plan for Giving the School-Tenchers
Their Back ray Undar Consideration.
The teachers whose salaries were held
out during the last hall of November and
during June will receive their delayed pay
during July according to Chairman Wal
ler of the Finance Committee of the Board
of Education.
In order to protect the teachers a war
rant covering the indebtedness in the ag
gregate will be made out and tiied for
auditing, and then the amounts due the
various contractors will be paid.
Under the law teachers must receive
their pay whether other h Us are settled
or not, and ihe teachers, being thus pro
tected, are believed to be satisfied with the
arrangement.

KEW 10-DAT.
CHANGED HER MIND.
Then Changed Her Body.
"Some people fail to arrive at correct
conclusions because they are too hasty,
and I have to watch myself on that very
point," s:iiii a lady. "1 said to a friend
the other day that I didn't fancy the grain
coffee, Postum, although nearly all my
friends use it. We tried it once, bin it
didn't taste as good as I had been told it
would, so we didn't serve it any more."
My friend asked pleasantly whether we
ever hud trouble with our coffee or tea,
and was toltl that now and then the cofft'.'
was "'sloppy" or burned, and occasionally
the tea was unlit to drink, but then, you
know, I said, we know coffee and tea can
De made good, so it is some faiiure with
I the cook i: tney come to the table unfit.
| "Ah, there's the point." my friend ex-
claimed. "Now we have been using
Postum steadily for about a year and we
know its magnificent qualities as a nour-
ishing beverage; but, mind you, 1 have
seen it served at my table onceÂ«or twice
almost unfit to drink, and we got one
package last summer that was overcooked
jat the factory and was not eooil, but
| which ihe grocer replaced; the*e inci-
dents do not change the lact that Postum
is a delicious, healthy and .nourishing
beverage, as proven day after day in our
fumily. .
"You should not hastily condemn a new
thir.g upon one imperfect trial, as you de-
prive yourself of benefit! which a fair test
would make yours."
"These comments made an impres-
sion, and, acting on her advice, I
hunted up the package . of Pos-
| turn, brewed some myself for breakfast
the next morning, and it really was as de-
licious to my taste as a high-grade coffee.
I noticed that morning that the heavy,
disagreeable feeling (usual after breakfast
with coffee) was absent This set me
I thinking and wondering if it was true,
i after nil, that'eoffea did slightly poison
my liver and stomach and make me feel
so. I concluded to quit coffee and t9a
a white, anyhow, and try Postum, and am
glad to say that lor that, or some other
reason, I never felt better in my iife than
I have since the change."
"Just as good" as Postum Cereal are-
words used to defraud the public.

Attorney Dalmas Toys With
Them in the Fair
Trial.
THE SAN RAFAEL STORY
UNCORKED.
Efforts to Prove That Mrs. Cra
ven Must Have Mixed
Her Dates.
DEFENSE'S OPENING ADDRESS
POSTPONED.
The Failure of Mr. Delmas to Speak
Proved Quite a Disappointment
to the Crowd.
The litigation over Mrs. Nettie Craven's
deeds to the valuable property claimed by
the estate of the Jate Senator Fair re
opened yesterday morning, but with a
sore disappointment for the public.
D. M. Delmas, leading counsel for the
defense, did not make the opening ad
dress, as had been promised. The well
earned reputation of this gentleman for
eloquence and lo?ic had the effect of at
tracting au immense crowd early to Judge
Slack's courtroom, all with the expecta
tion of enjoying a rare treat, and the un
welcome announcement that he was not
iroinji to speak caused many a long-faced
Jook aud sigh. Mr. Delmas made this an
nouncement himself, and further that
there would be no opening address for the
defense at al' at this particular time. His
side would wait until after the plain
tiffs had put in all of their direct testi
mony.
Mr. Delmas went on to explain that his
reason for not making an opening address
at this time was that he and his associ-
ates did not wish to jeopardize their right I
to move for a nonsuit after the other side
had put in its evidence. He asked, how
ever, that the court instruct tne jury to
tne effect that Attorney Pierson's openinp
address for the plaintiffs, made last week,
should be in no way considered as evi
dence and that no opinions should be
formed until both sides had been heard.
Judge Slack said he had so frequently
.Â«pofcen totbe jury on this point that he
thought it was scarcely necessary to refer
to it again.
The ions: table at which sit the attor
neys for Mrs. Craven was craced by an ad
d.uonal legal champion yesterday in the
person of Judge Curtis of New York, the
celebrated "will smasher." The Judge's
participation in the proceedings of the
day consisted chiefly of taking a part i:i
t he conferences which took place now and
then among his associates. He did no
talking, but took copious notes, and will
doubtiess be heard from later in the ses
sion.
Mrs. Craven and her daughter Margaret
were in court ail day m company with
two lady lr.ends. Over in the opposite
side of tt|e room sat Mrs. John Martin of
wili-conteat fame. She; was brilliantly at
iire<l and plumed and proved a most
attentive listener.
The attorneys for the executors hnve
chosen as their opening attack an effort
to prove that (Senator I-'air spent the L'4th
of September, 1894, in San Rafael, and
therelore could not have written the pen
cil will at Mrs. Craven's house in this
City end given her the disputed deed 3 on
that day. They produced three witnesses
wuo swore they saw tae deceased mil
lionaire in San Rafael. Their memories
were very fertile as regards that particular
date, but they cut rasher an unenviable
spectacle when Mr. Delnuas got at them
unJer crosfc-exaniination, and demon
strated that ihey couid remember little or
nothing else except that one date.
Mr. Delmas al?o iound considerable
Fan-faction in bringing out the fact,
through these witnesses, that *.he Sat!
Francisco Police Department, instead of
devoting its energies to the taxpayers,
who are assessed for the support of the
department, has been doing nearly all of
the evidence-hunting and witness- buzzing
for the plaintiffs in this case; that it has
been strangely active in assisting one side
in a purely civil case. He found out that
it was generally Detective Seymour, who
brushed up the memories of tnese wi;
nesses and caused them to remember so
accurately the commonclace eventsof one
quiet day nearly tbree years ago.
mour also served the subenas lor the j
p aintiffa and paid the witnesses their fees j
and mileage*
At t lie opening of the morning session j
Mr. rierson offered to place in evidence
Â«n age-stained deed showing that on
March 10 1877, James C. Flood conveyed
the property on Sansome and Fine streets
to Jatuef G. Fair.
Mr. Dilmas promptly objected to this
on the ground that the document had
nothing to do with the real issue of the
case.
The court thought the paper was admis
sible, aud upon this Mr. D-liaas declared
! thul the only i*sue in the case wa-< whether
i or not the deeds held by Mrs. Craven was
1 genii. ne. Ha thought that this was a
i matter that should be settled at once |
I and not be allowed to hang lire and de
velop into a matter of serious annoyance
, later on.
Judge Slack acknowledged that the is- j
I sues to be presented to the jury should be
I agreed upon as soon as possible, and he
' instructed the attorneys on both sides to
; be prepared to elucidate on this point im-
I mediately after recess.
Mr. Delmas tden objected again to the '
! deed. 'I his time he argued that tue '
j plaintiffs really had no ri<;ht to introduce j
any evidence at all, because the averments
In the answer to the cross-complaint did :
not constituto an equitable defense. This J
' was a technical point, he said, and he of- j
f-fred it for the purpose of getting a ruling !
I on the recorJ.
The court formally overruled the objec- |
j tion and an exception was noted. Tnen 1
! the deed was admitted, as were several |
others, all of which went to make up the j
; valuable parcel o; land at Pine and San- j
some streets claimed now by the execu- ;
: tors of the Fair estate. Then the disputed j
, Craven deeds were introduced and went j
; into evidence without eoecitic objection. ;
I These deeds were handed to the jury and ;
; the inspection of them consumed consid- ;
: erable time.
This done the iirst witness was called to ;
; the stand. He was Attorney Eugene W. j
j Levy, before whom Mrs. Craven made a ;
I deposition on August 28, 1896. Mr. Levy j
j simply identitied the deposition and the |
â¢ lady's signature. Mrs. Craven, he said, j
I was ill and in bed when he administered j
! the oath to her and was similarly situated j
! when she signed the document.
Mr. Pierson then announced that it was S
! the intention ot the plaintiffs to call at- ,
; tention to some of the admissions made I
; by Mrs. Crave" in giving that opposition, j
. and he called upon his associate, Charles j
8. Wheeler, to read excerpts from the dep- [
, osiiion.
Mr. Wheeler began by reading that part !
; oi the htatements that referred to the con- i
â  versation between Senator Fair and Mrs. I
- Craven on the day when he handed her I
j tfce now disputed deeds. In this state
j meat she that the Senator bad just
j finished writing the pencil will and. its ink
, copy, when Mrs. Haskell called his atten
tion to the fact thai he had not proviied
i for Mrs. Craven. The Senator said he had
I taken care of her in another manner, and
with that lie produced the two deeds from
his pocket and handed them to her. These j
I were relumed to him that day, with there
j quest that he have them properly acknowl
! edged. He did this and returned them to
I her later on.
At the afternoon session Mr. "Wheeler
: resumed his reading of Mrs. Craven's de
! position. He was particular to irive such
j emphasis as mi.rht possibly have a ten
'' dency to discredit the ssaiement, and read
j in detail everything the ir.dy had said re
' garding the events surrounding and con
nected with the writing of the pencil and
ink wilis and the delivery by Senator Fair
to Mr . Craven of the deeas.
Mr. Wheeler finally finished, and then
1 turning to tha attorneys for the defense
I said: ''Gentlemen, are you ready now to

THE ACTORS OF A DAY IN .THE CELEBRATED FAIR LITIGATION.
! produce the letter of Decembsr lfi, 1801,
â  purporting to have been written by Sen
; aior Fail to Mrs. Craven?'
"Certainly, sir," replied Mr. DelmaÂ«.
Mrs. Craven had the let;er, and handed
it over to Judge Den?on, the latter in turn â 
i giving it to Mr. Delmas. It was carefully j
! wrapped in tissue paper, so as to protecc j
; tho writing from being obliterated.
This is the letter which Senator Fair
j sent to Mrs. Craven, and in which he said
I he was a very sick, old man, a?ked Mrs. '
Craven to "take good care of the will I !
gave you," and said, in conclusion, '"I I
want to knock out all the papers those !
j fellows doeged me into signing."
The letter was precious to the defense, ;
; and when admitted into evidence a spe- '
j cial r* quest wi.s made that unusual care i
Ibe taken to see that nothing should '
I befall it.
Mr. Wheeler next announce*! that lie j
I wished to offer the "pencil will" in cvi- j
clence. He expect d to be immediately
stopped by the defense, but none of the
attorneys interrupted and he read the j
document to the jury.
Then, after the jurors had had an op
portunity to look at the document lor
themselves, George D. Shearer, a real es- â¢
tate agent o: fian Rafael, was called to the
witness stand. He said hewas an airent
during September. 18fÂ»4, and had an ofiice I
in the Parisian Hot<l building.
"Did you know James G. Fair in his i
lifetime?" asked Garret McEnerney, who i
was now conducting the examination for
the plaintiffs.
"I did." replied the witness.
"Did you see him in San Rafael during
the month of Sep.emOer, loUi?
"I did," was tha answer.
â¢â¢When?"
'On Hie 24th, and again on the morning
Of tne 25th."
The witness then went on to relate that
on the 24 h of September, Fair passed his
! ofiice and went ut> the street with his i
| valet, a Mr. Clark. "The witness did not
| -ice him again on that day, but he did *cc j
j him the following morning, when Fair |
and his valet took the broadgau^e train ]
to San Francisco. The witness saw iiiem i
corns out of the Parisian Hotel and get i
into the hotel bus. Shearer said l:e al-o !
took that train ajid rode across the bay â 
with them.
"That is all," said Mr. McEnerney.
The attorneys for thiÂ« deense held a i
conference, and then Mr. Delmas said they I
would postpone the cross-examination,
and would ask that the witness be in
structed to remain in court.
The other side objected to this method j
of procedure, but the courtdecided in favor â 
| of the defense.
W. H. Jeweij, a livery man, also of San j
â¢ Rp.fael, succeeded Shearer in the witness j
j rhair, and said he too had seen Beaator I
Fair in that city during September, 1894. j
He was quite sure that the millionaire j

valet, leaving for San Francisco on the
25tb. On the latter day the witness sad
he received a message to call for the Sena
tor and take him to the depot.
Jewell said he remembered seeing Sena
tor air in the convent grounds on Mon
day, the24tb of September.
"â¢What impresses it on your nr'nd that
that day was Monday asked Mr. Mc-
Enerney.
. "Only my memory," replied the wit
ness.
But this was not exactly what Mr. Mc-
Enerney wanted. He desired Jewell to say
more, and essayed 10 cross-examine him.
This, of course, elicited an objection from
the defense and resulted in the striking
out of considerable of Jewell's evidence.
There was some clever fencing between the
attorneys before McEnorney succeeded in
givinsi his witness tbe cue under the pre
text of enlightening tbe court as to what
he intended to prove by the witness.
Jewell now proceeded to remember. â¢ He
had received an order on the previous
day, he said, to have the bin call for Sen
ator Fair on Monday in time to catch the
l"2:4-5 train. The boy who drove the bus
reported to the witness that when he called
for him the Senator could not go, as he
was not well. Jewell said that later in
the Uav he saw the Senator in the con
vent ground*, and was surprised to see
him out, in view of the boy's report.
"Who was that boy?" asked. Mr. Mc-
Enerney.
"Connolly â Tim Connolly," replied
Jewell.
That finished the direct examination,
and Mr. Delmas took i lie witness in hand.
The attorney's first "inauiry was regard
iug a conversation Jewell had had with
Attorney McEnerney during recess, and in
rep y tlie witness said he had been asked
a. number of questions by that gentleman
regarding the Connolly boy.
Further questioning brought out the
fact that Detective John Seymour of the
regular San Francisco Police Department,
and who is supposed to be giving his serv
ices to the City rather than to private liti
gation, ha i subpenaed the witness and
had paid him his fee. More than this,
Seymour had been spending a great deal
of time in San Rafael, hunting up evidence
for the plaintiff's sido of this case. Sey
mour also subpenaed the witness to attend
the probate proceedings conducted several
months &20 in connection wifih Senator
Fair's estate.
"Did you have any particular conversa
tion with Mr. Seymour?" asked Mr. Dol
man.
"Yes, he paid me %b," was the response.
"Well, that was more eloquent than
words, but what I want to know is what
conversation you had with him," said the
counsel, and the sally caused quite a little
laugh.
'1 he only particular conversation Jewell
couid remember having had with Sey
mour was when the latter told him last
winter tuat there would be no more liti
gation in the Fair case for several months
after the probate proceedings.
Jewell was very hazy in his recollection
o! dateg and events during Fair's stay in
San Rafael with the exception of tnat 24th !
of September. He gave his questioner to
understand that he was very positive
about that day, but, of couse, not because
that was the day the Senator if >-aid to
have written the pencil will and delivered
the d eds to Mrs. Craven over on this side
of the bay.
â¢'What day did the 19ih of September,
1894, fall on?" asked Mr. Del ma?.
Jewell started in to figure it up and was
so long about it that everybody in the
courtroom began to snicker. When he
d:d finally hit :t Mr. Delmas wanted to
know how it was that the witness could
remember that the 24th fell on Monday
and had to do so roue i thinking and
head-scratchinir to get the day of the 19th
straightened out in his mind.
"Oh, 1 looked it up on the calendar,"
said Jewell. From this on Jewell found
himself in deep water and floundered
about considerably. He confessed that
Seymour probably reminded him of ihe
date; tnat Bhearer ha.; also impressed it
upon bin that the 24th of September fell
on Monday and the 25th on Tuesday, nnd
further, that in order to help along his
memory he had hunted un the San Rafael
newspaper files. He admitted that if he
had not gone through this process he
would not have remembered much about
the affair at all.
D. N. Schneider, a lad who had just
reached his majority and who acts as a
clerk in his father's cigar-store in San
Rafael, was the next witness. He testi
lird that he saw Senator Fair in San Ra
fael on the 24th of 8 ptember. He re
membered distinctly and could not be
mistaken as long as Mr. McEnerney asked
the questions, but when cross-examined
by Mr. Delmas he showed that his mind
was a counterpart of Jewell's.
He could not remember within three
months the date of any other event in
wtiich he and the Fair case were identi
fied. His mind was almost a b:ank as to
the ilntes on which he received his sub
penas and, in fact as regarded anything
else except t!ie clay he said he saw Senator
F:;ir. He. too, had seen a good deal of
Detective Seymour and had visited Cap
tain L?es' office to receive aia fees and
mileage.

tute of the sentiment of religion. He
concluded with the sentiment that the
greatness of religion is its recognition of
the preatness of life and the splendid pos
sibilities of a future.
Bi-hop William Ford Nichols dealt cau
tiously with the theme assigned him,
statin? that he couid readily raie a dis
pute should he venture to state some
things te believed which others would
bitterly deny. "But good fences m:ike
good neighbors," he said, "but there is a
handgrasp and a lieartgrasp which we
can indulge in without talking bosh and
without pretending that we all believe in
the same tilings."
Bishop Nichols told many eood stories
and kept his auditors in a nlea-ant mood.
President David Starr Jordan's paper
was heard with marked attention. He
said: "Every tie on the Panama Railroad
is said 10 have cost a human lite, and
every step in the progress of science has
cost a human life, ami the lives thus lost
have been of the wisest and best that
mankind has produced. It takes a life
time in the battle of science to discover a
fact, and when discovered it has always
been found that society i 3 conservative,
its natural inertia repelling new notiona.
"But it ib true that thera is a religious
sentiment in man, and if every fragment
of the church and creed were destroyed
to-morrow a new church would spring
out of the conditions of life. Thus it is
seen that much of the struggle of science
with error has wrongly been called its
right with religion. It has been said that
theologians lie strangled about the giant
Science as strangled snakes were found
about Hercules, but it should be said
rather that science has thus strangled
error and made advances. Much of the
reiigion of to-day is only the debris of our
grandfathers' science. A study of the
growth of knowledge is the besi antidote
10 bigotri". To come in when it rains is
the basis of meteorology, and to separate
the sheep from the goats is the basis of
zooiogy."
Professor Howison did not agree with the
views of President Jordan. He believed
that it ought to be the function of uni
versities to teach true theology and that
the churches ought to take their theology
from the universities, the use ot the
cuurches being for edification.
"Ii 3'ou judge religion wholly by its
historic r>hasei, ?I he said, "it has been a
failure, for it has not unified the race, but
has, rather, led to war and bitterness, as
Christ promised when he said he had
come to bring, not peace, but a sword.
Tuere is more dissension and there
are more schisms in the churches to-day
than at any time in their history. The
whole question of belief is approached in
the wrong way. It is wrong to believe in
one unchanging interpretation, but inde
nendent research ought to reach one con
clusion in religion, as it dews in science."
Professor Josepn Le Conte drew a
graphic picture of what the world would
oe if the moral side oi man were up to his
intellectual ieve! â a kingdom of peace,
truth, justice, lova and freedom.
"The mission of science is in a great
measure the discovery of truth," he said,
'and science shows the gradual growth oi
the universe .o higher conditions. It has
come from death to life, then to reason,
then to freedom. Science has solved the
great problems one after another, and will
yet solve tne problems of sociology and
uood povernm nt â highest of all prob
lems. Some day when coal gives out and
threatens to overthrow our industrial sys
tem science will use the tides and winds
and rivers to do iifiy times the work of
the world.
"If the preachers would only keep up
with ;ha scientists ail would be well.
Tney must pull together in lifting the
platform that holds humanity and the
rtp.v of good things will be at hand."
Rev. Dr. William Alger spoke chiv
alrously of women as "ihe ideal eiement
in life." He said the preponderance in
women is of the affection*, self-sacrifice,
conscience and esthetics, while men excel
In will, intellect and physical power. He
classed them as potent factors in uplifting
the race.
HOWARD CHURCH AGAIN.
Ihe Shadow of a Rot* Falls Athwart
the Presbytery.
The presbytery of San Francisco was in
â¢ession at the Mis ion Home on Sacra
mento street yesterday afternoon. The
proceedings were almost entirely of a
routine character, though one or two
portant matters came to lipht.
Thero was considerable discussion r
'.he report of a committee charged u h
investigating certain matters chart by
Elder J. B. Roberts of the Howard . e-.
--byterian Church against the pasto lev.
F. R. Farrand, and others, concerning
what he called the illegal use of $50C0
ci'-urch funds.
The committee reported that the alle
gations contained in Elder Roberts' letter
were not in proper form to De legally be
fore the body, and it recommended that
the letter be not read in the y.re3bytery.
Roy. J. Woodworth and others at once
argued that nothing ought to b 1 done in
s.'crecy and that the letter ought to be
read, particularly because of the writer's
long service in the church ; but the com
mittee's report was finailv adopted, much
to the regret of Elder Rober.s, who at
once arose and Â«a?d :
"Several members have suggested that
Ibe invited to speak. May I now be ac
corded that privilege ?"
"Not without the consent o! the presby
tery," said the moderator.
Then several members objected to open
! inp the question again, and Elder Roberts
j -inkr up sLarply, saying: "Then give
I me my letter and I'll trouble you no
further. I should also like a copy of the
committee's report."
He then put on his hat and left the
room with some feeling.
There was an important report by the
committee on narration, the theme being,
in a general way, the status of religion.
From the report it appeared that there
have been regular meeting* of all the
church societies, Sunday-schools and
churches during the year, but tne report
deprecates the tallinz off of interest in re
i lipion ar.d concludes in this way:
Some encouraging indications arc manifest
in a lev. of ihe churches, but oil the whole
â .here does not tetm to be any real advance.
Some of the churches report no new members.
One rcporis a single new member and another
two. The number Riven by two of the Urgest
and strongest churches is elevon and twelve.
â while the Japanese church reports twenty and
the Chinese seventeen.
The ihi tips reported as militating Against
the growth of religion are, "the float. ng popu
lation, lack of employment, and a prevniung
apatny concerning religion, with a growing
love of worldiy pleasure."
Rev. Mr. Mathena reported on Sunday
schools, recommending (hat the shorter
catechi&m be used in Sunday-schools and
that the Presbyterian Union be indorsed.
After this the presbytery adjourned sine
die.

VERY LOW RATE
TO CALIFORNIA
The Southern Pacific Agrees
to the $25 Single
Fare.
This Will Insure a Large At
tendance at the Endeavor
ers' Convention.
It Is Expected That the Adoption oi
This P.an Will Effectual. y Pre
vent Scalping.
By the action taken by the Southern Pa
cific Company yesterday it is as good as
settled that a $25 rate from Chicago to San
Francisco mil be fixed for the Endeavor
ers 1 convention.
Ever since it had been announced that a
$50 round-trip rate had been agreed upon
there had been more or less apprebension
that it would be rescinded, owing to the
danger of wholesale scalping that such a
rate would probabiy engender. And when
the Supreme Court decided against rail
road combinations and pools it was
thought that this combination rate would
come under the ban of illegality. Such^
however, was not the case.
But the scalping danger continued
prominent in the minds of some of the
roads, and quiet efforts were made by
some of them to have the $50 rate re
scinded. One of the strongest opponents
to such action was the Southern Pacific.
Its representative declared that this rate
bad been promised; that the Jocal people
interested had made all t:.eir preparations
in anticipation of the low rate bringing
large numbers to San Francisco, and that
hundreds of intending excursionists all
over the United States based their coming
on the same proposition.
The Southern Pacific even went so far
as to threaten to cut loose from all the
Eastern roads on this particular matter,
and to carry intending visitors to this City
for $50 for the round trip over its Sunset
route, via New Orleans.
Several days ago the suggestion was
made by some of the Western roads to sel;
tickets from Chicago to San Francisco for
i-->. and to also charge the same figure for
the return passage. At lirst. the Southern
Pacific felt disposed to oppose this ar
rangement, but was finally induced to
consent. The rate already has the approval
of most of the interested road*.
It is expected that this plan of selling
tickets separately each way will effectually
suppress all scalping in connection witn
the Endeavorers' convention.
It is also likely to bring many to this
coast who would not otherwise come. As
ibis low rate will be obtainable at a date
more than two months from the present
time, it will give time for many horne
beekers to take advantage of it, so that
with the influx of Endeavorer delegates
there may also come an army of immi
grants.
Returning visitors will be granted stop
over privileges in California, so thai they
will have nniple time to learn by personal
experience the advantages and beauties
of life in the Goloeu State.
To the Yoaeinite Via Merced.
As the roads to the Yosemiie Valley via
Merced are now in tirst-class condition,
the Valley road will begin taking Yosem
ite tourUis to Merced on Wednesday even
ing. There close connection will be made
with stages lot the valley.

APPALLING FIGURES.
Which Prove the Oreat Caro That
*"- Should Bo Exnrcisert by Those
Who Lore rife.
Thevnverase number oi deaths in New
York City for five years has been G9O eacli
week. Of this number 2SS, or neariy one
half, have been from pneumonia, consump
tion or sor^e pulmonary trouble. This is
not theory, but actual figure 3 made by the
Board of Health. Nearly eight;/ thousand
people in live years in New Yorlc City
alone have ' died from throat and lung
troubles! When we think of the thou
sands who had throat and lung diseases
and who have recovered how terrible an
array of facts does this present.
Doctors have said in the past that most
of these troubles were incurable; they aro
now finding that such is not the case." The
best physicians deciare that a man or
woman, even in an advanced stage of con
sumption, can livo for years and even to old
a c by a careful and constant use of pure
whisky, but it should be remembered that
â the word pure is always used by physicians.
There is but one absolutely pure whisky,
and that is Duffy's malt. In its purity
resls its great power, although it has other
qualities possessed Dy no other whisky.
A child can take it witi ont any evil effects,
and for restoring partially consumed
lungs, building waste tissue and giving
health and strength in the place of disease
and weakness, it stands absolutely without
a rival. Care should be taken to secure
only tue genuine. Do not trust any dealer
who tries to substitute something in the
liace of Duffy's, but insist on having what
you call for.

CHICAGO MARKETi.
CHICAGO. 11.1,, April 26.â 1t was the bears'
turn to ride the wheat market this morning, and
they did so with a vengeance. May dropped from
74%ct073%c against Saturday's rlos ne price.
76* /B e. In a wild rush to unload many ("toj-lois
orders were received. The excitement did no: last
over fifteen minutes, but the pit was as active as
it Is ever seen. After reaching 73% c the market
reacted with a jerk and a slow recovery to 74 5/Â»c
took place. The war news started the fun. the
prospects of a speedy settlement of the GraDCO-
Turklsh war creating an universal Jesire to unload
wheat. The cables were also be.irisii.
In provisions tne lar^e r- ceipta of hogs and lower
grain markets had a depressing effect. Packers
were the principal se.lert and prices dpclined.
The trading se.lors Saturday were the best buyers
tc-day. The cash market continues very dull.

A Chinese writer 13 waging war against
the practice of loot-binding. "Meu should
not despise girls with natural feet," he
says; "Chinese women nave bouiid feet
and are too weak even to bear the weignt
of their own clothes. They think it looks
nice, but in reality it does not look nice,
and weakens toeir bodies, often causing
death. "

A Nugget of Gold Found
in a Chicken at

Scores of Pecp'e Go Out to a
Ranch in the Homestead
and Prospect.

Oaklanp Office San Fkancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 26. j
Thero is great excitement in Haywards
to-day, and in tne vicinity of the Home
stead score? of people are eagerly examin
ing tne ground hunting for a gold mine.
On several occasions during the past
few years there have beÂ»n indications that
gold exists in some parts of this county,
iat although camp? have often been
formed, nothing of value has been dis
covered.
Yesterday Mr. Sieboldt, the proprietor
o;" the Hay wards Villa, lound a fmall ring
get of gold in the stomach of a cuicken
that his cook was preparing for th- Sab
bath menu. It contained about $3 worth
of pure gold and naturally there was
great excitement in the quiet town. An ,
investigation was made to discover the
origin of the chicken, and it was soon
learned that it was one of a batch bought
from a Portuguese rancher in the Home
stead.
Ti;e rancber, on learning that his
chicken had been eating gold, at onca
commenced to do some prospecting. He
hunted all over his rancb looting for the !
mine from which his hen had eaten her
golden meal, tie did not find it, however,
but the search was not given up. This
morning several Portuguese went out to {
t!.e ranch and began carefully examining j
me stones and er.ivel to try to tind some I
gold. Other'- more venturesome pulled
up w> eiis and cabbaces and carefully ex
amineri t c roots, expecting to rind some
yeliow dust upon tiiem.
A- there are about fifty acres of the j
ranch there was plenty of opportunity for j
lite prospectors to put in a hard day's
work without getting in each other's way. i
and, when they compared conclusions at i
the und of the day, all were equally dis
appointed.
The facts, however, are declared to be j
absolutely true regarding tha nnding of
the nugget in the cnicken's stomacn, and
there is no explanation to be made oi the
manner in wn:ch it tot there. Local in
â .ere-t in the prospective gold mine from
*h:ch t *j*s nugeet came is not, however,
killed, and diring the next week there !
will no doubt bs all kinds of people prod- !
ding and scraping ali.over the Homestead. |
Plan t> Connect Two lioadi.
OAKLAND, Cal.. April 26.â A plan is
now b ing arranged by which it is hoped
to build a loop from Trestle Glen around

piece of c ectric road would connect the

road with the Grove-street system, and, as
both these lines are now Controlled by |
the realty syndicate, the plan will proba- j

OAKLAND, t'At... April 26.â Bernard J.
Stokes, the fireman who died Saturday as
the result oi injuries sustained while an
swering an alarm, was buried by his com
rades to-day.
As the procession turned from Twelfth
etrtet out Broadway a little scene was wit
nessed which waa a surprise to the crowd
cÂ°. the sidewalk and which caused much
comment. The red-shirted fire laddies
were passing iha City Hall Park as the fire
beil from the adjoining engine-house was
beinj; solemnly tolled. A party of English
people, evidently from some shiD on the
estuary, we:e watcning Uie procession,
ami, according to the custom of their
country, they very respectfully bared tne;r
heads until tne hearse had passed. This
lit le tribute to tiie dead fireman whom
none of them knew was paid so unosten
tatiously that none of the Britishers were
aware ot the fact that their action caused
any attention.
The funeral service* were held at the
house of the deceased, where Father
Gleason officiated. The pallbearers were:
George Molfitt, Harry Moffitt, John Ho
gerty, William Kennedy, George Mul

CHIEF LLOYD'S IDEAS.
They Provoke Warm Critlclam From a
Prohibitionist.
OAKLAND, Cau, April 26.â The re
marks of Chief L'.oyd regarding the grow
ing of grass in Oakland if prohibition were
enforced is likely :o create an interesting
controversy between tne saloonistÃ and
anti-saloonists. A correspondent writing
to the Enquirer to-night makes the fol
lowing strong comments on Chief Lloyd's
article:
Chief Lloyd is an honest and capable officer,
unquestknuoly, bat he ta:ts too mach in
print, and hi* public views nre singularly de
ficient in good judgment Â»nd breadth of ob
servation. Whether ,ne total abolition of the
saloon in Oakland Is a wise policy or not may
bo a dcbatab;e <iuÂ«s'. on, but Chief Lloyd's re
marks on the subject are both absun and mis
chievous. To say that if saloons were Closed
"grabs would crow in the streets of Oakland"
and business tic ki.ied Tould be excusable in

union, but is singularly unbecoming a public
official.
His duty Is to enforce the law, not to print
commentaries upon it. Grass has not grown
in Cambridge, Miss., nor in a. dozen other
towns in New England, whose population
"and manufactures excelled thoÂ«e 01 Oakland.
On the contrary the facts and figures of these
towns show a decided increase In prosperity,
virtue and happiness. Woe be to h town
whose principal trade is the retail liquor busi
ness, and which must gaugs its prosperity by
the number cf its saloons. Contrast Sutler
County, without a single saloon for ten years
past, and also for an insignificant expense lor
criminal administration, with Yuba County,
which maintains saloons spends thou
sands annually in criminal conrts and
prisons, not to estimate the moral harm in
curred.
Chief Lloyd would do well to stick to his po
lice duties and spare us those semi-occasional
outbursts of unwisdom and new-fangled meth
ods for bringing in the millennium, especially
through the medium of the open saloon.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 27, 1897.
ST. MARY`S WANTS
TO BREAK RECORDS
Prefect Lastian Has Se
cured Some Valuable
Prizes.
The Annual Field Day Will Be
an Event of Unusual
Importance.
Athletes Who Will Make New Records
Have Already Gone Into
Training.
Oakund Officb Ban Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 26. j
The athletic association oi St. Mary's
College intends to make heroic efforts to
beat some existing records at its annual
field day to be held May 6.
For more than a month the leading ath
letes of the college have been earnestly
training, anc . they are determined that
nothing on their part shall be lacking to
uphold the honor of their college, so that
if they do not make any new records it
will be beer.use they are physically unable.
Brottier Lastian, the prefect of tbe col
lege, is personally taking a great interest
in the field aay, and be has obtained
many valuable prizes for the successful
competitors. A handsome cold medal
will bs awarded to the winner of the 105
--yard championship, which race always
eiciies great interest at 6t. Mary's. One
oi the most interesting features of the day
will be a tug of war between two team 9 to
be selected from the students, and as
there is a good number of athletic young
fellows to select from the contest cannot
possibly be tame.
Frank bilva '98 will be in chartre of one
team and William McCartney will captain
tbe other side. An additional attraction
will be provided this year by the college
brass band. It has been considerably aug
mented and new interest has been >hown
in it by the student?, and under the direc
tion of Professor Fchorcht it has attained
a hi-_'ii degree of prchciency. The band
will be on the campus during theexercises
und will enliven the proceedings with a
cuoice programme.
In the evening a musical and literary
programme will be given by the pupils in
the college auditorium. This will be fol
lowed by the distribution of prizes to the
successful athletes. The day's proceed
ings will terminate with the annual ban
quet, which will be held in the dining
hall.
The officers of the College Athletic Asso
ciation wo ure in charge of the Held day
exercises are; J. "VV. Solen '97, Redwood
City, president; J. F. Cone '97, Montana,
vice-president; B. J. Fiood '97, Hollister,
secretary; T. H. Donovan '98, Hollister,
treasurer; William J. Rattigan '98, San
Francisco, field captain.
President Solen is very anxious that the
club should distinguisn itself on this occa
sion, for after several years' connection
with college athletics he will sever his
connection with St. Mary's this year, it
beinn the time for his class to graduate.
"We have some excellent material at
the college," he said to-day, "and we shall
be very much disappointed if we do not
set some new marks lot others to reach."
LOOP L HES.
The Knllroad Willing to Consider a
Plan to So Aw:Â»v With a
Bridge.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 26.â The rail
road company has given out an intima
tion that it is ready to consider a proposi
tion looking toward the operation of its
trains in Alameda by a loop line, Â«o as to
avoid the necessity for a:i expensive
briiige across the estuary, as at present.
It is willing to consider the matter and
put an engineering force in the field at
once to ascertain just how the problem
can be me:.
Briefly, the plan is to lay a third rail on
the local roads and to extend the [ recent
narrow-gauge from the west end of the
San Leandio Bay bridge around to a junc
tion with the broad-gauge line from Park
street to Fruitvale. With tht* connection
trains over the brond and narrow eauee
lines would start from the present narrow
eauge pier. The broad-gaugo would de
flect from the narrow-gauge road at Rail
road avenue and make the same stops as
at present; but instead o! stopping at
Park street ami going back, it would keep
on aronnd to Fruitvn'e, and then over the
Oakland local to the mole. Other trains
would leave the broad-gauge mole and
come to Alameda over the route just de
scribed, bringing up at the nurrow-gauge
mo'e.
Over the present narrow-gauge line the
same lystem would be followed, so that
no matter which way a train was running
through Alameda it would finally arrive
at one of the moles. Much time lon in
waitin : for trains would thus be *BV<Â»d,
there would be an absence of the over
crowding at certain hoars of morning and
1 night and no bridge would be required
j acrossthe estuary.
It is probable that tho trustees will ap
point a committee to confer with the rail
-1 road about the matter. The people of the
| eastern portion of this city are strongly in
favor ot the plan, as it would give them
transportation facilities of which they aro
ai present deprived.
M.ifii.-d i City Trustera
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 26.â A resolu
tion wa* introduced at the meeting of the
City Trustees to-night calling upon the

the Ab.-psb jr'i salary has been recently
increased and his work only takÂ«s up four
or fire months during the yenr he should
pay the salary ot the second deputy out of
his own pocket. Mr. Schulte maintained,
furthermore, that for the timp employed
the Assessor is the best-paid officer in the
city. The salary of the deputy was re

panies besides the battalion drill. The
officers of inspection consisted of Colonol
J. <'. Currier assistant adjutant-general,
M. G. <\, and Captain F. de L. Carrington,
U.S.A.
A feuture of the drill was the execution
by the second division of the Roman hol
low-square. Its excellent work drew a
loud ourst of applause from the bleachers.
The university bannsr and colors which
had been carried by Company D, under
Cnptnin Bau-r, for the last "year, were
awarded to Company H, under Captain
Son. for tho excellence and precision with
which his company executed tha various
orders.
The competitive drill having come to an
end, the field was cleared in preparation
for the blank-cartridge battle. Not a
soldier-boy was in sight for a few min
ute?, when suddenly the rifles of the
sharpshooters from the First Division,
who had been stationed along the south
ern boundary of the campus, began to
crack. This was the signal for the on
slaught of the Second Division, which had
taken refuge in the grove of tree< along
the northern border of the battlefield.
Immediately two companies, supported
by the artillery detachment with two
guns, emerged frcm their covert and be
gan firing. A skirmish line was sent out,
advancing at intervals upon the enemy,
which remained stationary.
Presently the enemy poured down upon
the advnncini: columns a heavy volume of
smoke, causing a hasty retreat.
The second battalion then advanced to
within clo^e range of the tirst.when with a
sudden movement they captured the guna
and won the day.
The iriendly tight was short but fierce.
It would have been longer and more de
tailed had the cadets been supplied Â«vitn
more ammunition. As it was only six
rounds each were allowed the young sol
diers, and tweniy rounds for the cannons.
This wa* LieutenantWinn's last regu
lar day of service at the university, his
term of three years having expired. He
will probably be succeeded next term by
Lieutenant Sidney Cloman, now in New
Mexico, who has bce-i recommended to
the Government by the regents for ap
pointment to the university.
During the morning drill Left-fielder
Hoaz of the Varsity baseball nine caught
the third ringer of his right hand In the
brake of one of the guns, lacerating it
seriously. It is feared he will not be able
to play ball in Saturday's game against
Stanford us a result. Ho already has one
"baseball fineer" on the same hand.
T)lÂ«eafted Cows
BERKELEY, Cal, April 26.â D\ H. N.
Rowell, Berkeley's Health Officer, haÂ» be
gun his raid on diseased cows. He bus
already condemned and ordered to bÂ»
killed eight cows out of the seventeen he
ha- examined.
"List Friday and Saturday." said Dr.
Rowell, "we used the tuberculin test on
the cows or Dairyman Morris Cohen and
found that eight out of the seventeen
were diseased. We officially tagged the
animals and ordered that they be Killed
and turned over to us for post mortem ex
amination. This he refused to do, and so
to-dny I had aim arrested for refusing to
comply with the hiw. Cohen's piece is on
the border line of the town, and It is
probable that in bib defense he will main
tain that Berkeley officers have uo juris
diction over him.
"There is a county law as well as a city
ordinance which requires t: at persons
holding cattle affected with tuberculosis
shall kill the same at the order of the
proper authorities. "We are engaged in
the exaruinr.tion of the second dairy now,
I Bid it is probable that more cattle will be
ordered killed very soon.
"It is a strange fact that some ot the
fattest and sieekest cattle in the drove are
consumptive, while many of the thin and
6crawny ones are wholly free from the
disease."
University Election.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 26 âAt the
annual election ot the Assoc ateJ Stu
dents to-day, Philip Thayer, '93, was
elected president of that body; Meliville
Dczier, president of the athletic associa
tion, and 11. J. Cross, baseball manager.
A Lecture and lliillr.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 26.â A well
attended lecture and entertainment un
der tho auspices of the Laague of the
Cross was s;iven to-night at Elite Hall.
Captain Hynos made a neat little speech
of introduction, in which he outlined the
purposes and aims of the league, and
Thomas Allen followed with a vocal solo.
The Ideal Banjo Ciub proved to ba a
clever little baud, and Miss Ai;ne- Far
rell, whose song followed, was warmly en
cored.
Rev. J. P. Ferguson then delivered his
lecture on "The Church and Free Insti
tutions." His arguments and points were
similar to those expressed by him in Met
ropoir.an Temple some months att".
Geor c UaywarJ, tne Athenian Quartet,
Miss May Gilbert. Miss Emily We. is, and
Joy Laughter rendered numbers which
completed the programme. The affair
was in charge of the following committee
of arrangements: John F. Mullins (chair
man), Charles 8. Higgins. J. Henry
Long, James Collins, Walter Smith, John
Haves.

true to yon nnd who are false, what hopes you
may havi- winning' your d?Mres and what obsta-
cles are In your way and how to remove them.
How to make tne best of your talents and pros-
per. How to gÂ»t money. I find lost articles and
locate hidden treasure. Before en ering into bust-
ness, law, divorcr or marriage consult me. Drive
away evil spe:ls, â¢uunti.lni; blocks, bad luck and
habits, anil overcome ail evil works, rivals and
enemies. I never fail. I have brought abont
more happiness than hII oth. indiums. thers
are be helped; why not you? If you are going to
see a medium, why no at>e the very best? It costs
no more. Nothing to be paid in advance, and if
not entirely satisfactory nothing at all. Do you

SPRECKELS
TALKS OF
THE TREATY
Was Opposed to Hawaiian
Reciprocity From
the Start.
WAS A SCHEME OF THE
TRUST.
Has Never Been and Is Not
Controlled by the Sugar
Combine.
WORKING FOR THE INTERESTS
OF HIS COUNTRY.
Money Paid for Hawaiian Sugar F.ows
Mostly Into the Coffers of
Europeans.
CUraa Bpreckels has every reason, he de
clared in an interview yesterday, to be
lieve that the Hawaiian reciprocity treaty
will be abrogated. His confidence in such
an outcome, he said, was due to the facr
that right ami reason were on the side of
these who favored the discontinuance of
the existing convention.
â¢'Reciprocity." he continued, "means an
exchanee of benefits that have some ap
proach to being equal on both sides. No
one. I believe, will attempt to controvert
such an interpretation of the terra. Now,
I claim, and existing facts and circum
stances will bear me out fully, that the
treaty in force between this country and
Hawaii is reciprocal in name only, and
that all the advantages arising under it
are enjoyed by Hawaii, or rattier the for
eigners resident there.
"At the present time the balance of
trade between the United States and
Hawaii is $-\ OOO,OOO per annum, and no
effort i< made by the Hawaiian Govern
ment to encourage more trading with the
United States. On the contrary, every
thing that is done tends to the encourage
ment of trade with other countriesâ
notably Canada, Germany and England.
They have even withdrawn the subsidy
formerly paid to the Oceanic Steamship
Company, an American line which has
done more to develop the islands than
any other transportation company.
"I noticed a statement in one of the local
papers that our commerce with Hawaii
was a great factor in givinc employment
to American vessels, and that the Ameri
can shipping engaged in this traffic has a
valuation of $1S 000,000. Any one who will
take the trouble to look over the Custom
house records can lsarn lor himself that
the value of all vessels carrying between
tiiis port and Hawaii wiil not exceed
$2,000,000.
"Much has been said about the trust
beinc interested in the beet-sugar factory
at Watsonville and of its being opposed to
the Hawaiian reciprocity treaty. It is

cia.raed by the advocates of the treaty
that if the Hawaiian free sugar is pre
vented from coming here the trust would
be able to shut down one of the refineries.
That is simply nonsense. The Watson
ville factory is turning out 20.C00 tons of
sugar annually, and the Salinas factory,
in course of construction, will have a
capacity of 60,000 tons. Thus these two
factories alone will be capable of manu
facturing enough sugar to supply the peo
ple ot the Pacific Coast, and all this sugar
will be refined on the coast.
"But in addition to these factories there
are two others, which produce between
20,000 and 30,000 tons per year. All this
will also be relined here, and t'hU will
mean not a curtailing of the refining ca
pacity but an increase of it. It would not
pay to ship the raw sugar East, have it
refined tnere and then have it sent back
to the consumer.
"The result will be the establishment of
more refineries in California. And in
stead of the California product being used
a* a supply for the Pacific Coast States
and Territories it will go to consumers in
t'e Missouri River territory and perhaps
eventually as far East as Chicago.
"This means employment in CalifDrnia
of additional thousands of people, tlie
great enhancement in value of farming
properly in the sugar-beet sections and
added prosperity for the State at large.
''Let me call attention to a phase of the
situation that is entirely lost sight of.
We are taking from Hawaii its entire
crop of sucar, which will this year be
about 233,000 tons, for which we will pay
in round rigr.res $10,000,000. Of this prod
uct not to exceed 70,000 tons are turned
out by Americans, while the money for
the remaining l(>5,000 tons is paid to Ger
man and English planters and manufac
turers, and out of the 70,000 tons credited
to Americans 45,000 tons are produced
from the plantations in which I am inter
ested.
"Mv course in this matter iÂ« prompted
simply and solely by my desire to see the
sugar industry of California fostered and
improved. My opposition to the Hawaiian
reciprocity treaty is inspired by the de
sire to encourage the investment of Ameri
can capital in ibis State instead of paying
millions each year to the foreigners â not
Hawaiian* â who largely control the sugar
product of the islands. Not even the
workmen emplo}*ed on the sugar planta
tions and in the factories are native
Hawaiian s, but Chinese and Japanese
coolies and Portuguese, who receive from
$I to $lo a month and must and them
selves.
"Those who are standing for a continu
ance of the treaty I am sure are not aware
of the fact that the money we pay for Ha
waiian sugar does not benefit the islands,
for it eventujfty mostly flows to England,
Germany, China and Japan. My conten
tion is that the money can be and should
be kept in this country, and this can be
accomplished by the abrogation ot the ex
isting treaty with Hawaii and by placing
the same duty on Hawaiian sugar that is
placed on any other similar foreign
product.
"Another popular fallacy that is being
circulated is that I was always strongly
in favor of this treaty. That is not so.
No one was more bitterly opposed to it
when it wns under consideration than I,
and I spent at one lime about $2800 in
sending a petition with a long list of sig
natures attached to Washington in I^7o in
opposition to it.
"At that time I was importing the raw
material from Manila and Batavia and
had to pay duty on it. There was a com
bination at that time between the sugar
trust, with Searles at its head, the sugar
planters of Hawaii and the owners of 'he
American Sugar Refinery of this City
against me because I would not go into
the tru*t.
"For self-protection 1 proceeded to the
islands and soon became the largest sugar
raiser there, with the ultimate result of
not only beating the trust and its combi
nation on the coast, but of invadinS its
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 27, 1897.
best territory in the East and erecting a
refinery in Philadelphia. I have never
allowed the trust to control me in the past
and it does not control me now. While it
has an interest in the Watsonville factory
that fact still leaves me an independent
factor in the sugar market, and this posi
tion I propose to always maintain.
â¢'While still owning large interests in
Hawaii, I began experimenting with
sugar-beet growing in California, as I
never felt just right to have my capital,
mostly made in California, invested in a
foreisn country. My experiments proved
highly successful and the result is now be
fore the world.
"I have sacrificed large interests in
Hawaii, and stand ready to make further
I sacrifices. I feel that I owe my first duty
to this country, and have always endeav
ored to perform it to the utmost of my
ability. I have at last succeeded in trans
ferring the major part of my interests to
I this State, and the benefits that have ac
crued to the commonwealth I think 1 can
safely leava to the people of the San Joa*
quin, Pajaro and Salinas valleys to tell.
"I am confident that when the people of
| the United States are put in possession of
I the facts connected with the Hawaiian
! treaty there will be an almost unanimous
sentiment in favor of its abrogation. If
we continue the treaty it will be equiva
j lent to putting at least $15,000,000 annu
! ally into the pockets of a number of Eng
; lish and German sugar producers and the
I coolies whom they employ, instead of
j keeping this vast amount of money in
i this country to be distributed among our
j farmers and the people employed in our
own sugar plantations, factories and re
fineries."
O`SULLIVAN GETS
A CHARIVARI
The Barytone's Friends
Welcome Him at the
Tivoli.
14 Shamus O'Brien " Makes a
Great Hilâ Dramatic Music
and Plot.
It would be hard to say which made the
bigger hit at the Tivoli last night Denis
j O'Sullivan or "Sharaus O'Brien," the
opera in which he created the title role in
' London a year ago.
The California barytone's friends went
1 to give him a charivari and very thor
j oughly carried out their purpose, but
! O'Fulllvan's work was so connected with
the delightful opera that both were ap
plauded ana honors were about equally
divided.
The house was crowded with the most
j responsive audience that has neen Been in
i this city for a long time. The complete
I success of the opera and its performance
j no doubt added fuel to the ardor of O'Sul
j livan's friends. At the end of the sec
i ond act people rose to their feet and made
I the buildine ring with cries of "O'Sulli
! van," "Shamus O'Brien."
"Sharaus O'Brien" is an opera that
I keeps spectators on the continual quivive.
The book, by George 11. Jessop, tells the
story of Sheridan Le Fanu's celebrated
! poem in a way that is full of movement
. and color, the action fairly dashes along,
'â  and it abounds with sentiment and fun
' strengthened by powerful dramatic move
. ments. as, for instance, when the banshee
I is heard wailing without to portend the

Round the thrilling plot of "Shamus
O'Brien," Villiers Stanford has written a
delightful score that abounds with melody
and is staged in a thoroughly modern
and effective manner. The music is al
ways appropriate to the situation, nnd to
a certain extent the orchestra transcribes
the emotions that are passing on the
stage.
Choruses and solos alike are telling and
the melody is Irish in type, though the
comt>o*er has only used two traditional
folk songs, "Father O'Flynn" and an old
marc" tune known as "The Glory of the
West,"
O'Pullivan was an ideal Shamus O'Brien.
His heroic appearance and sympathetic
acting, aided by the attraction of his fine
voice, made hin> everything 'hat could be
desired for the dasintiir Irish hero.
In concert he is afflicted with a vibrato
thai border? on a tremolo, but in opera
this defect is scarcely apparent, and oth
erwise his singing leaves nothing to be de
sired. His two great songs brougtu him
thunders of applause. "I'veShrapened the
Sword" is a dashing maritial air, and the
song by Stanford, interpolated in the sec
end act, was rendered with sympathetic
feeling.
Miss Myra Morella has a <=weet voice and
made an arch and charming Kitty. Two

Big Hit in "Shamus O'Brien "
Last Night.
of the prettiest bits in the score are her
duets with the capiain, "Well, He'd Take
Me by the Hand" and "So It's Kisses
You're Cravinp." Miss Morella and Uhys
Thomas did full justice to both.
Rhys Thomas was in his element as the
British captain of dragoons, and for his
song, "I Can't Let Him Goâ l Can't Give
Her Up," he pot a periect ovation.
Another member of the Tivoli company
who rose brilliantly to the occasion was
Maurici Darcy us Mike Murphy, the in
former. Bacb a wretch as Mike scarcely
deserved the fetching solo. "Ocbone, Wnen
I Used to Be Youne." Darcy garnished
this solo with some tellinp humor.
W. H. West was a good Father O'Flynn,
and Miss Laura Millard made a successful
Nora. Ihe choristers sang the (lashing
choruses well nnd acted very cleverly,
particularly in the jig-dancing scenes, and
ihe orchestra, conducted l>y Carl Martens,
added to th<' success of the performance.
"Sbamus O'Brien" is very well staged
and costumed. Judging :rom last nimbi's
enthusiasm, it i* booked for a long run.
Baldwin Theater.
The principal feature of Primrose aud
Wesfi minstrel performance last night was a

were introduced. The big sugared cfce wft s

"A Run on the Bank," with those popular
entertainers. Ward and Yokes, that opened at
the Columbia last evening, has all the qualifi
cations necessary for a successful farce-comedy.
First and foremost, there is noc even the laint
est thread to hang a piot on. But then there
are plenty of pretty girls in abbreviated skirts
and big hats who sing well and dance grace-
I fully.
'A Run on the Bank" is crammed to the full
! with clever specialties and Dew jokes. Each
performer in the cast is an artist in his or her

Lucy Daly, who was here last with the "Pass

people, are bound to make maay lauehins
friends. *
At the Grand Opera-House.
"The Smugglers" is one ot those plays that
is warranted to give one so many shivers per
minute. There is beauty in distress, suffering
virtuous maidens, a noble hero and a despic
able villain, who at last meets with his just
deserts. '
The play is handsomely staged, and the
scenes In -The Smugglers" are realistic to the
extreme. Miss Euith Lvndou is a charming
Mamie Wolford, and is especially stunning in
her natty boy's suit. All the cast is in good
hands, and the play moves smoothly lrom
start to linish.
Alcazar Theater.
"A Nob'.e Rogue" held the boards at the
Alcazar last night. The "swinging bridge"
was undoubtedly the hit of the evening.
Melodramas are noted for their wonderful
mechanical effects, and though "The Noble
Rogue" crowds its best effects into one act
they are none the less startling for that. A
huge swinging bridge opens and a steamer
passes up the river. Miss Virginia Jackson
made her first appearance at this theater and
promises to establish herself as a favorite.
Mrs. F. M. Bates effectually disguises herself
In a black make-up and appears as Phillis

Of George Osbourne's Jack Adams, the hon

repeat praise already bestowed. Baby Lewi9
plays Teddy, a wail, ana sings and dances her
self into high favor.
At the Orpheum.
Six new people opened at the Orpheum last
night. The Midgleys, juvenile cnaracter de
lineators, made a distinct hit. Their act is
full of mirthful songs and good dancing, so
they succeed in delighting their audiences.
Alexander Tacianis, the phenomenal male
soprano, did some clever work, as did Al and

BALDWIN STANDS
BY HIS BATTERY
Lillian Ashley Is a Hyster
ical, Nervous Woman
Amid Defeat.
The Gay but Grim Millionaire
Will Not Part With a
Dollar
i
Will Go East Soon and the Girls Who
Played Tramps and Lost My
Do as They Can.
Lillian Ashley yesterday retrieved
nothing from the defeat she suffered the
day before in her campaign against
"Lucky Baldwin for the support of the
little blue-eyed girl, who she and Judge
Slack say is his.
The gay millionaire was ahead in the
dramatic game at nightfall, and is likely
to remain so while Lillian remains on a
sickbed in St. Luke's Hospital, at leant.
There are no indications that E. J. Bald
win intends to pay one sou markee to the
adventurous woman, who is cutting bo
big a figure in his present career, and
there is no clear prospect of what is going
to become of Lillian, Sister Emma and
little Beatrice Anita in the near future.
The hack that whirled them to the Mis
sion night before last dodged about and
whisked into Dorland street, a little, tin
kempt, ungraded and still side thorough
fare that lays open a short row of blocks
between Seventeenth and Eighteenth
streets, north of Guerrero. It stopped in
the sand before a neat little double Hat,
and into the lower one, at No. 216 V* two
of the three trunks were carried. Tuat is
where Sister Emma and the baby are now
wondering what is going to happen next.
Lillian Ashley is at St. Luke's as a
patient of Dr. \V. H. Mays, who is attend
ing her. Dr. Mays was her physician
beiore and during the trial of her auit
against Baldwin.
"She has wasted greatly since that
time,' 1 said Dr. Mays yesterday, "and is
but a shadow of her former self. She is
now suffering from complete nervous pros
tration and also lrom something which
requires a severe surgical operation which
might enable her to recover her health. I
know of no friends here and of no re
sources which *he has. If she has any
friends, they ought to come to her aid, for
she badly needs medical and surgical
care."
It's worry and not bittterness that Lucky
Baldwin is getting, but Mr. Baldwin is
keeping his end up, and he can face a
whole lot of worry.
"Of course there's no telling what will
happen," said one of his private detectives,
"and Mr. Baldwin will simply have to
keep on ins guard. But Mr. Baldwin
won't have a bodyguard going around
wild him. We wanted him to, but he
wouldn't."
'Mr. Baldwin is doing nothine, noth.
ing," declared his attorney, Reuben H-
Lioyd, indignantly yesterday. 'The wo
man lihs been put oat of the hotel and
Mr. Baldwin has nothing to do witd her.
Settlement of the matter? Never! I
wouldn't give her a 5-cent piece," and the
brisk lawyer snapped a linger contemptu
ously. "They will never blackmail Mr.
Baldwin out oi a cent. They can't scare
hint. He's been through the war too many
times. Why, when he was shot at in the
courtroom I was twice as scared as he
was. He was cool as a cucumber."
Baldwin is going East. He was going
anyway, and he may find it necessary to
go in a day or two.
It transpires that when the Ashley girls
arrived at the Baldwin as Mrs. and Miss
Lay of Chicago they had drawn up a doc-
I ument by which Baldwin was to agree to
pay $10,000 in satisfaction of all claims.
They came to make the bold and dramatic
play on the advice of a Pasadena lawyer,
not counting on finding Baldwin out of
town. They intended to request him to
call on Mrs. Lay in her room and then
play trumps.
They would have failed in that, for
Lucky Baldwin has adopted lately a new
and wise rule for all such cases. He sends
word that he will see the lady in the re
ception-room, as be did three week-4 ago
when a stranger sent a winning summons
from her suite in the hotel.
Attorney Kowalsky says that he acted
wholly in behalf of the hotel people, who
wanted to get the women out of the house,
and that since they are gone his interest
in the matter has entirely ceased.
The situation is a drama of hate, with
grim determination in the bating hearts.-
