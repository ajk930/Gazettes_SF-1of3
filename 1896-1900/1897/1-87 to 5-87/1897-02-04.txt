TKIAH, Cain, Feb. 3 âBenjamin Hen
derson, a pioneer of this county and one
of its wealthiest and most influential citi
zens, was killed this morning by a Mexi
can sbeepherder wno had been in his em
ploy lor Borne time. News of the affair
first reached here about 11 o'clock,
when James Cleveland, a rider on the
Howard ranee, reported the murder at the
Sheriff's oiiicp.
A party, consisting of Sheriff J. R. John
son, Under Sheriff Philo Handy, District
Attorney George A. Sturtevant, Coroner
J. H. Barker and several others, at once
left for the scene of the tragedy, about
three miles northeast of Ukiah. The
Russian River bank was full and it was
hardly deemed advisable to attempt to
ford it norm of this place, therefore the
party crossed on Clark bridge, southeast
of town. Upon its arrival at the scene of
the affray tne posse found an old Mexican
on the place. He had previously been de
scribed as the murderer and the officers
took him in charge. He was brought to
town and placed in jail by Sheriff John
son and Under Sneriff Handy.
When the jail was reached there was a
iargre crowd surrounding it, and cries of
"Bring a rope," and "Hang aim" were
hea-rd. This demonstration had been an
ticipated by the officers, and preparations
to effect a speedy transfer of the prisoner
.ac horse he was riding to the build
l id been made. The man was hurried
I j the jail and placed where no one
could reach him. No danger of mob law
is anticipated at this time.
At the jail the prisoner stated that his
name was Gregorie Ybarra. He had come
to this county three months ago from
Point Orford, Or., and had for the past
four weeks been in the employ of Hen
derson, cutting- wood and doing chores
about the ranch. This morninj;, accord
ing to his story, he asked Henderson to
pay him some money tnat was due him.
The rancher stated that Ybarra would
have to wait until he went to town to get
some money from the bank. A dispute
then arose as to the price to be paid for the
cutting ot some wood, Henderson claim
ing tnat he was to pay 75 cents for two
tiers, while Ybarra maintained that he
â¢yras to be paid that amount for each tier
of wood cut. Later the dispute was re
newei wien Henderson carried some of
the wcod into the house. Ybarra de-
mnrred and -hot words were exchanged.
Ybarra states that he was sitting down
peeling potatoes at the time, and that as
Henderson came at him with a three-foot
stick ol woort he jumjed up and, in self
defense, inflicted the wounds that subse
quently caused Henderson's death. There
were, so far as can be learned at this
time, one wound on the dead man's body
and one on the left <i !e of the neck, ex
tending from the left ear around under
the chin and severing the jugular vein.
Henderson, after lie had been stabbed,
ran toward the house, eighty yards dis
tant, and after addressing a few words to
a man who was present fell over on the
floor and expired.
William Owens, an employe on the
Henderson ranch and who was present
when the rancher expired, was an eye
witness of the killing. He teils substan
tially the same story as the prisoner. Im-
ately after bis arrest, however,
. Ybarra, in a statement to the Sheriff, de
nied any knowledge of the affair.
Benjamin Henderson was a man about
70 years' of age, and was well known and
respected throughout the county. He
was a prominent member of Abell Lodge
No. 146, F. and A. M., of this place. He
settled at Sherwood Valley in the north
era part of this county in 1859, shortly
after bis marriage at San Francisco. He
has accumulated lar?e interests in the
.valley and owns considerable town prop
erty, as well as timber land and sheep
ranges. Thirty thousand dollars would
probably be a low estimate of the value of
his holdings. He has for the last thirty
rears lived alone on the ranch where he
was killed, he never having married after
he and his wife separated in 186 L His
estate, by a will executed some time since,
is bequeathed to Robert McGarvey Jr. and
Mrs. Victor McMullen, children of <-x-
Superior Judge McGarvey of this county.
The prisoner, Ybarra, is a stranger in
this part of the country. About two
months ago he was brought to Ukiah by
Deputy Sheriff Martin Hart from West
j.on to be examined on a charge of in
sanity, but at that time after an examina
tion he was pronounced sane and dis
charged. Shortly after his discharge he
. entered the employ of Henderson. He is
a Mexican, 50 years of age, very slight in
|u;ure, but exiremely muscular. He
#i eajes very lit'.le English.

learned that the famous little steamer
Dauntless nad left port Tuesday night,
and was supposed to have slipped by the
warships and gone to sea.
At noon, however, his anxiety was re
lieved, for the Dauntless came steaming
into port and tied ap at Clarke's wharf.
The steamer was tied to the dock Tuesday
night and this morning she was gone.
. The explanation is that the owner of the
Dauntless had applied for permission for
the tug to encage in the towing and
wrecking business on the Florida coast
and last Saturday made affidavit that the
steamer would not violate the neutrality
laws.
Tne affidavit was forwarded to Washing

last Tuesday night, when Collector Bisbee
received a teleeram from the Secretary of
the Treasury saying that the affidavits
were not satisfactory and directing him
not to allow the vessel to go outside of the
river without an officer of a revenue cut
ter on board.
When the collector started to call on
Captain Gilgore of the revenue cutter
Boutwell this morning he found that the
cutter had gone down the river, and that
the Dauntless had taken time by the fore
lock and skipped out. The return of the
alleged filibuster greatly relieved his
mind.

.Vl\/.N7-f;/;.s jhÃcuss REFORMS.
Canovaa' Scheme started Upon at a Meet
ing of the Cabinet.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 3.â The Standard
to-morrow will print a dispatch from its
Madrid correspondent, saying that at a
Cabinet meeting held to-day the Minis
ters discussed for several hours the
scheme of reforms for Cuba prepared by
Senor Canovas del Castillo, the Spanish
Premier, and Colonial Minister Castel
lano.
The reforms include a broader municipal
and provincial administrative decentrali
zation than the recently sormuiated re
forms for Porto Kico.
Tho principal feamfe of the plan is the
creation of a local assembly styled the
council of administration, consisting of
twenty -one members, part of wnom shall
be elected by direct limited franchise and
part by corporations and commercial in
terests in a similar manner to that in
which the Spanish Senate is elected.
The powers of the Governor-General are
much developed under the scheme, but
the Cuban chamber will be empowered to
make a colonial tariff on the condition of
always securing a high protection for
Spanish imports.
Apart from this concession, the chamber
will only have the control of local affairs,
the Cortez continuing to vote the budgets
and conclude all legislative treaties.
The Cuban representation in the Senate
and Chamber of Deputies will remain un
altered.
A dispatch received by a new? agency
here says the scheme of reforms was
finally agreed upon by the Ministers and
will be signed by Queen Regent Christjna
t o-morrow (Febmary 4). This dispatch,
however, gives no details of the reforms
proposed.

CRAIG AND FRANK
IN WARM DEBATE
Heated Argument on the
Pilotage Bill in Com
mittee.
Representatives of Contending
Interests Almost Come
to Bows.
Final Action on the Measure Will {
Be Taken in Executive
Session To-Day.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 3.â Aside
from the Duckworth episode the meeting !
of the Senate Committee on Commerce to
night to hear further argument on the
pilotage bill introduced by Senator j
G;eaves, who is the chairman of this com
mittee, was the most exciting and sensa
tional of the present session. A large
delegation of what is designated the San
Francisco committee of commerce, headed
by Hugh Craig, was present, and also two
of the pilots, who were represented before
the committee by Attorney Frank.
The hearing had not advanced far when
the first altercation between Messrs. Craig
and Frank was precipitated. These be
came more frequent as the proceedings
advanced, and it looked at one tlnle as if
the affair might be made thoroughly dis
graceful by an exchange of biows.
Trhougbout the whole trying ordeal Frank
remained imperturbable, while Craie was
kept in almost a continuous state ol deep
choler.
Hugh Craig secured the ears of the com
mittee first when the pilotage bill came
up and stated that a conference had been
held by tne Committee on Commerce with
thre pilots, but that the latter had refused
to make any concessions look me: to a com
promise bill.
Nathan M. Frank, the attorney who
was present to represent the pilots, denied
that any conference had been asked for.
All that hud been done bythe committee
of which Mr. Craig was spokesman, he
said, was to send to the Pilot Oommis
missioners â not the pilots â for certain
statistics, which could be obtained only at
the Custom-house, to which office Mr.
Craic was referred. Continuing Mr.
Frank said:
"We asKed them to state the cause of
their making this trouble, but they could
not give us any answer. The reason, how
ever, appeared later when we ascertained
that they wanted us to exempt American
vessels from the payment of pilotage.
After consulting with my clients I found
that such a thing was not feasible."
Here came one of the outbursts of pas
sion on the partoi Craig that subsequently
frequently disturbed the proceedings.
"The gentleman has misstated the
facts," he broke forth, "and we want to
place ourselves right before the commit
tee."
He said that tbe concession asked for
was that no compulsory pilotage should
be charged when no pilot was employed.
Frank said this was exactly what he had
stated â it was practically free pilotage,
for every one expected to pay for services
that were actually rendered.
Figures on compulsory pilotage were
asked for by Senator Gillette, and they
were given for sailing vessels only by Mr.
Frank, who stated that the pilots had not
had time to get out those for steamers.
The statement submitted showed that
$349,396 had been collected for the eleven
years ending with and including 1594.
Tben Frank threw another and success
ful bomb into the camp of the Craigites.
"These gentlemen come before you," he
quietly, slowly and significantly said,
'purporting to represent certain organi
zations of San Francisco. Ostensibly you
have before you the Chamber of Com
merce ol San Francisco, represented in
the person of its president, but in reality
that gentleman is not authorized to repre
sent that body here in this matter. I have
a letter here from the secretary of the
Chamber of Commerce which will bear me
out."
He produced and read the following let
ter addressed to Louis Sloss, one of the
trustees ot the Chamber of Commerce, who
had asked the secretary for information
on the subject:
At your request I have examined the
minutes of the Chamber of Commerce for 1896,
and find that no action has been taken either
oy the Board of Trustees or the chamDer on
the pilotage question, except to petition Con
gress to enact a Federal pilotage law, which
will control pilotage at all United States ports
to the exclusion 01 State control, under the
provisions of the constitution of the United
States that Congress shall legislate on all
matters connected with interstate and foreigu
commerce, the chamber holding that pilotage
and quarantine are distinctly included in this
provision. With much respect, your obedient
servant, William L. Merry,
Secretary and Treasurer.
Inm under the impression tnat the mem
bers of the chamber generally are of the opin
ion that pilotage rates should be reduced, but
no action of the chamber has been proposed,
as above stated.
After Frank had reail the signature,
and before he had time to read on, Craig
was up and asked him to please read on.
Frank, without deigning to even glance
in Craig's direction, said he would finish
reading the letter if he were not unneces
sarily interrupted. He added that the
postscript was put on the letter at the
personal solicitation of Craig, and then
took another center shot at his wily ad
versary.
"i had a talk with a number of mem
bers of the Chamber of Commerce," he
said, "on this subject, and I found none
who s emed to be in favor of the bill be
fore this committee. One of them went so
far ss to say that he considered it to be
nothing more than an unadulterated cinch
on the pilots."
Mr. Nayior, one of the members of the
San Francisco Committee on Commerce,
arose m wrath and said he thought the
action of Frank was discreditable.
Craig's iace became scarlet, and in a
frenzied manner he exclaimed that he was
the gentleman whose veracity had been
questioned. He then attempted to show
that be was the delegate of the body he
claimed to represent.
He said action had been taken by the
Chamber of Commerce in 1893 looking to
a reduction of pilotage charges, but be
failed to show that he was present on be
half of the Chamber of Commerce, unless
he as president of that organization had
appointed himself without the knowledge
and consent of that Dody.
But Frank had another "stem-winder."
as the street gamin's vernacular would
phrase it. He charged that neither George

alleged to be representatives of the San

RAWLINS GOES
TO THE SENATE
End of the Deadlock in the
Legislature at Salt
Lake.
The Ex-Congressman Wins the
Contest by a Narrow
Margin.
Thatcher's Defeat Finaly Encom
passed by Leaders of the
Mormon Church.
SALT LAKE, Utah. Feb. 3.âEx-Con
gressman Joseph L. Rawlins was elected
United States Senator this afternoon by
the Utah Legislature, receiving thirty-two
votes, the minimum necessary to elect.
Thatcher, the other leading candidate, re
ceived twenty- nine, and two votes were
scattering. The breaking of the deadlock
came suddenly, and was the result of an
arrangement with the supporters of Judge
Henderson, who, seeing they could not
elect their candiaate, flopped to Rawlins
almost immediately.
Thatcher owes his defeat to the action of
the Mormon church leaders, who opposed
him bitterly during the entire campaign.
Henderson was the church candidate, but
despairing of electing him, they com
promised on Rawlins, not because they
wanted Rawlins, but because they would
have taken almost anybody to defeat
Thatcher. The four Populists and one
Republican voted for Thatcher; one Re
publican voted for Brown and the other
voted for Ra*rlins.
J. L. Rawlins was born in Salt Lake
County, Utah, March 28, 1850, and lived
upon his father's farm until he was 18
years old. He completed a classical
course in the University of Indiana, but
returned to Utah before graduation. He
was professor in the University of Deseret,
in Salt Lake City, for two years, until
1875, when he was admitted to the bar,
and be has followed the profession of law
ever since.
He was elected delegate to Congress
from the Territory of Utah in 1892 on the
Democratic ticket, defeating Frank J.
Cannon, now United States Senator.
While in Congress he did great service in
support of the act enabling Utah to form
a constitution and be admitted to state
hood. He also obtained the passage of a
special act of Congress providing ior the
return to the Mormon church of about
$500,000 worth of property escheated by
the Government ten years ago and other
wise distinguished himself. He is a Gen
tile and one of the ablest lawyers at tne
bar of the State and is a cultured and
refined gentleman.

to the Colonies.
As a moral monstrosity Murderer But
ler, who now occupies a cell at the City
Prison, ranks above any criminal that ha 3
ever been seen in this City, not excepting
Theodore H. T. Durrant.
Though his perusal of the daily papers
has shown him that the meshes of the
law are tight about him, he bears a brazen
front, and answers even the most search
in? questions with a nonchalance that
amazes his hearers.
The cruel fiend of the Australian bush
seems to take particular deiight in telling
stories that, in the beginning, sound lite
confessions, but later on turn out to be
jokes at the expense of his auditors. He
pretends to take a Using to some visitor
who has given him a cigar, and after
puffing awhile at the weed says:
"Now, I say, this talk about my mur
dering Lee Weller has some foundation
after all. Of course. I did not kill him,
but I know something about the matter
just the same.
"He went out on a prospecting tour
with me and my mate and my mate killed
him. That's bow I got theae things. My
mate went away and the trinkets were
left in camp and they fell to me."
He told this story to Constable Conroy,
the dramatic Australian sleuth, yester
day afternoon, and when the latter be
came so interested that be knocked bis
own hat off trying to get his head throueh
the bars and catch every word ButJer
quietly confided tbat the murder was
done in Chile.
This is on a par with the other stories
that Butler tells, and all are given with a
twinkle of the eve that betrays his joke
to those who watch him closely.
He seems entirely oblivious to the
hangman's noose and laughs when the
subject of his reception in Australia is
mentioned.
"It will be all right when I get there,"
he says, with a heavy accent on the last
four words. "At present lam doing first
rate. Frisco is a great place."
his main concern yesterday was to get
pipe and tobacco and a change of clothes.
"With all thefe nice ladies calling 1 to
see me," be remarked, "I ought to have
some decent duds to receive them in. I
want white shirts and some clothes that
will make me look like a gentleman."
Butler did a rushing business yesterday
selling his autographs to those who called
at his cell. He was not high priced, but
signed for all who cared to pay half a dol
lar for a name scribbled on a piece of
paper or card.
"I sign any name they like," he said.
"Butler or Weller; it is all the same to
me. Most people want the name I used
on the ship, and they get it all right when
they put up half a dollar."
To the Australian detectives Butler is
particularly pleasant in hi? general de
meanor, but the expression of his eyes as
he glances at them through half-closed
lids is not pleasant to look upon. The
glance plainly says, "I wish I had you out
in the bush alone."
He spent several hours during the after
noon in conversation with Constable Con
roy and told a different story every half
hour. He denies knowing Conroy except
since his capture, and takes particular de
light in refusing to remember incidents
that the young Australian tries to recall to
his recollection. Detectives Roche and
McHattie spent some time yesterday in
trying to convince Butler that it was no
use to fight against going to Australia.
They told him that they could take
him back by the steamer that sails to
morrow if he was willing, but if ho
allowed his lawyer to conduct his case it
would be at least a month before the long
sea voyaee could be begun.
Butler shrugeed his shoulders and re
marked that the matter was out of bis
hands and that his attorneys were doing
all his legal business and bad told him
not to bother his head about his case.
"I'll make the best of it here until I see
my way clear," be said, "but I may a3
well tell you now that I am as anxious to
go back as you are to take me."
Butler was in the midst of his auto
graph-writing yeateraay afternoon when
he was called out of his cell to interview a
press representative. His cellmate, who
is also a hard-looking customer, took ad
vantage of the murderer's absence to
write Lee Weller several times on carda
presented for that purpose at 50 cents a
signature and those who paid the money
went away none the wiser.
NOT BUTLER'S WIFE.
A Woman From Napa Who Could
Not Identify the Australian
Fiend.
Mrs. Butler, tha woman from Napa who
believed she had found her truant hus
band in Lee Waller, alias Butler and othei
names, the accused of many ruurdero in
Australia, called upon Captain Lees yes
terday morning at the City Prison.
She is a comely woman of about 35 years
of ace, fair ot face and of fine proportions.
She again related tne story of hÂ«r mar*2
riage some four years apro to a m an who
deserted her and his ciiild, and told bow
the portraits of the prisoner in the news
papers made her think that he waÂ« the
man she had sworn to love and obey.
''Did your husband have any distin
guishing marks about him?" asked Cap
tain Lees.
"Yes," she answered, '*there was a scar
on his neck."
"Nothing elÂ«e?"
"No, but bis mannerisms were such that
I would know him the moment I saw
him, no matter what he had done to him-
Belf for the sake of i> disguise."
"Was he tattooed about the body or
limbs, feet or hands?"
"No, not a single marr on him of that
kind."
"Didn't he have tattoo rings around his
fioners?"
"Nothing of the kind."
After this conversation Butler was
brought into Lees' office and confronted
with bis alleged wife.
"Madam, is this your husband?" asked
the aetective, waving his hand toward
the prisoner, who stood between two offi
cers.
Mrs. Butler hesitated. She was not
sure, evidently. She stuttered and said:
"No; unless he isfl very much altered."
Looking at the prisoner a few seconds
longer she said: "No; I'm positive now
he's not my husband, because Butler was
fully 5 feet 10 inches in height, ana this
man is much shorter."
Bailar was made to show his hands,
which are tattooed, and the lady from Xapa
subsided. She retired and left the City for
her Napa home a: 3 o'clock in tise after
noon.
Butler spent most of the day in his ceil.
He received many visitors, who, as a ruie,
offered him cigars, which he accepted, and
asked nim questions about himself, which
he politely refused to answer. To one in
quisitive newspaper man he declared posi
tively that he was tired of answering ques
tions in the negative. He calmly sat oack
on his bench when the inquiry was made
if he woulj not write a confession of tne
crimes of which he was accused and
laughed most heartily.
â 'I teH you what to do," he said. "You
write out the confession and I'll sign it
â with any of the names I have been called
in this case."
SHREWD DETECTIVES.
How the Australian Sleuths Fast
ened Butler's Crimes on Him.
ThÂ« story of how Captain Lee Weller's
murder was fastened on Frank Butler and
the murderer followed to this City forms
one of the most interesting incidents in.
connection with the case.
Two of Australia's keenest detectives,
John Roche of Sydney and James Me-
Hattie of Newcastle, worked up the
case, and tney never left tbe trail from
the day that it became apparent that
Butler was the man wanted until they
saw the handcuffs snapped on his wrists
on the Swanhilda's alter deck.
Captain Lee Weller, with whole murder
Bntler is particularly charged, went to
Australia a year ago with his wife, the
conpie taking passage from Cape Town on
tne ship South Esk. Mrs. "Weller died
suddenly on board the South Esk of heart
disease, and in September last Captain
Weller went to Sydney.
Tnere he was attracted by an advertise
ment in a Sydney paner, calling for a mate
to go Drospecting. kobert A. Luck â¢am,
Â» reporter on fie Sydney Bulletin, was n
friend of Weller's, and arranged that the
latter should write him each week 10 lell
of his success in the gold fields. Weller
left Sydney on October 28 and on Novem
ber 20. not 'laving hard from the mariner,
Luckham told tne police that he suspected
his friend had been made away with, as
be had gone out with a stranger and had
not sent any word of his whereabouts.
The Inspector-General picked out Jolin
Koche, who is generally called wnen im
portant cases are on hand, and sent h.m
to loofc the matter up.
He was not long in finding that Wel
ler's male had returned to Sydney on No
vember 1, ttiree day? after leaving, and he
quickly identified tne man who had ad
vertised Â»s Buter and within a day or
two had 500 piiotographs copied from an
original, sent all over the colonies.
It was found that Butler had passed at
different places as Frank Harwood, b.
Burgess, Sampson, Llair and other names
and that te had left Sydney as Lee Weller.
One of the phntograpns readied Detec
tive McHattie at Newcastle and from the
description that accompanied it tiiat as

whom tie had seen on tbe streets of New
castle a number of times.
Within six hours he had located his

Then came the long race across the
ocean to head of the big four-master,

Koche going the other way in order to

Butler's extradition. â 
It isevnient that Butler intended to ply
bis horrible vocation in Newcastle, for on
November 17, two days after he arr ved
Â«here, one oi hs fatal "ads" appeared in a
Newcastle paper, asking for a mate with
Â£10 to go prospecting. He evidently took
ttlarm before his plans were matured,
however, for he did not call for the
answer*, but sailed on November 230n the
Bwanhilda. At least filty letters, answers
to the advertisement, are now awaiting
him at the office of the Newcastle paper.
BUTLER AS ASHE.
He Admits Certain Facts to Captain
Leesâ His Canadian Life.
During the conversation Captain Lees
toad with Butler on Tuesday, Butler said
he arrived in this city on the Star of Rus
sia, but he could not fix the date. There
was trouble on board the ship, and he
deserted by swimming ashore. He was
then known as Richard Ashe. A few days
Jater he went to work In a French laundry
on Thirteenth street, .near Howard, and
they were beginning to remodel the build
ing when he left.
After leaving the laundry he went by
boat to Vancouver Island, thence to Port
land, where he signed papers as sailor on
a ship whose name was something like the
Btrathmore. The ship sailed from As
toria with a cargo of wheat for Europe.
He signed as Hie ard Ashe. '.'
The captain asked him why he went
under the name of Richard Ashe at that
time, and be said he was only following
the usual custom of Bailors by changing
his name when it suited him.
Yesterday the captain made inquiries,
and ascertained that the Star of Russia
arrived here on October 31, 1891, and on
November 17 Butler went to work at the
Le Grande laundry on Twelfth street,
woich has also an entrance for employes
on Thirteenth street, between Howard
and Folsom. Superintendent Bouton of
the laundry tola the captain that the
name of Richard Ashe appeared on the
timebooks in the capacity of fireman and
engineer from November 17, 1891, to Feb
ruary 8, 1892. He could not recollect
the appearance of the man, but he
'thought Mr. Glenn, one of the employes
of the laundry, might be able to identify
him.
â  As Butler, alter leaving the laundry in
February, 1892, went direct to Portland
via Vancouver island and shipped on the
vessel at Astoria it is possible that the
sailed from there some time in March.
Butler was seen in the City Prison last
night, but be said be could not remember
the name of the ebip that sailed from As
toria,
"What do you want to know for?" he
asked testily. "That has. nothing to do
with my arrest."
Gradually be became talkative and said
be bad been at one time in Canada in the
province of Manitoba. Then he said be
had been in Quebec in 1888.
"Were you a sailor then?"
"No, I wasn't." said Butler. "I was
only a sailor when I wanted to go from
one country to another."
. . He .would not say what employment he
followed in Quebec. He told a visitor
Tuesday that be had been a policeman, in
Canada, but when nsked about it last
night he simply smiied and parried the
question. Ju-t then some sightseers came
along and stared at Butler and he refused
to enter into any further conversation.
Butler during conversation remarked
that the representative of a paper had
yesierday offered him $500 for the publica
tion of an exclusive story of hi? confession
of the murders of which he is charged,
but he had laughed at the offer.
Captain Lees has been unabiÂ« to find
where Butler was born. He told the cap
tain that he was born in London, Ens
land, but his voice is not thai of a Lon

kNEW BUTLER'S GIRL.
How Constable Conroy Curiously
Came to Figure In the Case.
Constable Conroy and Butler were
acquainted with the same waitress, the
pne to whom Butler pave the picture of
himself that was "borrowed" from her
home by Detective Roche, ana which
proved so effective In tracing Butler to the
Swanhilda, on which he had shipped from
Newcastle.
Conroy's connection with the case is
peculiar. He was living in Sydney at the
time Butler's mining expedition adver
tisements were appearing occasionally in
the local papers. Conroy was then a pro
fessional athlete; he had been for fi teen
years, although bÂ« is now but 2G years of
age. Sometimes he took his meals at the
restaurant where this waitress worked,
and he formed a speaking acquaintance
with her. Incidentally he told her that
lie came from Aibury, a mining town.
She remarked to Butler that she
knew a young fellow from Albury, wnere
Butler claimed to own a mine. He said
that he would like to meet him. Tne
meeting was arranged.
Butler then asked Conroy to trace on
a map he submitted to him the tnrÂ«>e cold
bearing districts aboui Albury. Conroy
did so. At that time Butler showed
Conroy the certificates from the Ballarat
School of Mines, that Conroy has identi
fied among Butler's effects examined
Here by the police. He also identified
some of the jewelry now in the possession
of the police here, and said that it had
been made from nuggets he had picked
up on bis prospecting tours.
He wanted Conroy to accompany him.
It 'would requ re but Â£10, or about $50.
That was about September 10. on a
Wednesday. On the following Friday
Conroy gave his answer. He had decided
not to go. A business proposition in Syd
ney and the looks of Butler deterred
him.
Butler soon thereafter took out young
Preston and murdered him, and perhaps
six weeks later took Lee WeJler out to his
death.
On November 23, the very day Bntler,
then unsuspected by the police, sailed
from Newcastle in the Swanhilda Conroy
joined the Sydney police. Detective
Roche, then on the so-called "Mountain
Muider Mystery' three days, had learned
that Conroy had met Butler. The
next day Conroy was put on the case to
assist in tracking the man, whom he had
not before suspected, but whom he
could easily identify. So it was that
Conroy came here to identify Butler.
And he did.
He not only identified Butler as the
man he had talked with and arranged a
map for, but during the examination he
obtained a bit 01 suspicions evidence that
frizhtened him a little.
In taking with Butler at that first
meeting in September Conroy had re
marked that he had a brother-in-law and
a sister living at Albury. Butler said
that he would take pleasure in calling
upon the brother-in-law when he went
down to look at % mine he owned near
Albury â a mine for which he had been
offered, he said, Â£3000 pounds, or $15,000,
but he wanted Â£4000.
Butler was absent from Sydney for a
couple of weeKs after that, but later Con
roy saw him on several occasions, on all of
whicn Butler stood treat â insisted upon
it â and always showed money.
Not until the day of Butler's captors,
however, did Conroy dream that Butler
had called at bis married sister's home in
Albury, as he had Intimated he wouli.
Among Butler's effects was found a
checkbook belonging to Conroy's married
â ister. Her name (Mrs. C. O'Connor) and
the name of Conroy's unmarried lister
were written inside the cover. The only
inlerence that Conroy could draw was that
Butler had stolen the book when fte
had called on his brother-in-law.
ROCHE'S LUCKY TRIP.
Sped Nearly Round the World in
Bast Time Yet Made.
Detective John Roche of Sydney, Aus
tralia, in pursuing Butler, established a
new record for fast travel between Syd
ney, N. S. W M and San Francisco, by way
of Melbourne, Australia; Adelaide, Aus
tralia; Colomo, island of Ceylon; Port
Said, Suez Canal; Naples, Italy; Paris,
France; Calais, France; Dover, England ;
London, England; Liverpool, England;
Queenstown, Ireland; New York, Jersey
City, Washington and Chicago.
He was fortunate in , making all his rail
road and steamship', connections without
having to wait.
He made the trip in 49 days, 16 hours
I
and 15 minutes. The best previous record
was two days longer than 1 1 is. Ho left
Sydney on December 7at 5:30 p. m. He
arrived in San Francisco on January 26 at
9:45p M.
Had it not been necessary for him to go
out of his way to visit Washington and
thereby lose three hours he would have
arrived here thirteen hours earlier, as he
could easily have cot the fast train from
Chicago that reached here Monday at 8:45
p. m., wheieas the slower train diU not get
here until Tuesday at 9:45 A. M.
He traveled by train from Sydney to
Melbourne, and "thence by train a^uin to
Aueiaide, where he arrived just in time
to catch the Koyal Mail steamer Austral,
which sailed at noon on December 9 for
Naples, Italy. The Austral, by the way,
is the big steamship that went down in
the Sydney harbor in 1892 and was raised.
For fourteen day* and fourteen nights tbe
great vessel steamed across the trackless
ocean before sue once halted, and then
she had cone only half her journey to
Naples. That first stop was at Colomo.
on the island of Ceylon, and it was made
two days before Christmas. On January
3 the Austral stopped again. This time at
Port Said, on the Suez canal, to take on
coal, after steaming night and day for
nearly a month. Christmas and New
Year had been spent somewhere on tne
Indian Ocean.
Up through the Suez canal and across
the Mediterranean Sea the big Austral
plowed her coarse. On January 7, at 9
a. m., she landed at Naples.
Roche took the train thence to Paris,
where he arrived at 6 a. m. two days alter
ward. The same aay he went by trttin to
Calais, arriving there at 3:30 p. it., and
going at once on the boat bound across
the channel for Dover, England. He
reached London at 7 o'clock that same
evening.
It was Saturday, and he could not see
the Government "officers to obtain the ex
tradition warrants until tho following
Monday. But that mattered little, for the
next steamer for New York would not
leave Liverpool until Wednesday, as the
last had sailed from Liverpool at noon
that very day, ten minutes before he left
Paris.
On Wednesday, January 13, he left Lon
don on the passenger special for Liver
pool. Four hours later arrived at Liver
pool, just-a half hour before the Teutonic
sailed at 3p. M. for New York. At mid
night the Teutonic stopped at Queens
town, Ireland. But the mails from Dub
lin for America were late and the steamer
had to wait.
Roche, whife at Queenstow*n, was within
seventy miles of the home of his boy
hood, of his aged parents, whom he
had not seen since he left for Australia
seventeen years before, and yet he dared
not take chances of arriving here too la:e
to extradite Butler. Then he did not
know that Detective Mcllattie had come
to and was even then in San Francisco.
At 2 p. m. on January 14 the final start
was made for America. On January 20
at 5 p. m. the Teutonic landed at New
York. The next morning Roche left for
Washinsrton, arranged for the extradition
papers after 3 p. M. and on to Chicago at
7:10 that night. The next nignt he ar
rived at Chicago at 9 o.' clock. The fast
train had leit at 6. He took tbe next
train at 11:30 and came straight through
to this i ity in three days and a half.
He left bydney fourteen days after But
ler left Newcastle on the Swanhilda, and he
Deat him here a whole week, after almost
circling the globe.
A LOS ANGELES BUTLER.
People tn the Southern City Think
They Knew the Murderer.
LOS AXGELE3, Cal., Feb. 3.â The
Australian murderer, Frank Butler, it is
asserted by persons who knew ' him at
Seattle and other places, resided for a time
on East Fourth street, in this city. He
i lived with a woman, but it is not known
' whether or not he ever made any
claim that she was his wife. He dressed
very "loudly" and attempted to play
! masher on matinee days at the entrance
' (o the local playhouses. An intimate ac
iquaintance of Butler, whoknew him well
â¢ in Seattle and afterward in this city, refer
ring to his career in the northern town, -
said of him:
"At that time Butler was playing in the
Court Theater band in Seattle. He waa
di*iiked by his comrades, and was
eenerally regarded as a sneak and a thief.
Afterward, Butler went into the business
of selling jewelry. Where he got the
jewelry to dispose of to s-econd-band men
is not known and was not known then,
but it was surmised that he was either a
fence lor San Francisco thieves or was
doing the larcenous work on his own ac
count. Butler often boasted In Seattle
that if he could make a living no other
way he would hold up a man ior all that
he had. He tried to blackmail several
prominent people. He would watch people
with sporty predilections, and then alter
shadowing them, endeavor to extort
money for preserving silence on their
doings. He received a whipping once
from the hands of a railroad man for try
ing to blackmail him."
All of Itis acquaintances agree that
Butler was a tough, unscrupulous charac
ter, yet they did not think that he bad
the courage to murder.
FISH AND GAME LAWS.
The Sportsmen's Association Want the
Open Season for Duck-Shooting
Lengthened.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
met last evening and rescinded the reso
lution of a previous meeting, to lease a
section of marsh land for the purpose of
establishing a preserve. The association
will continue to live under the laws that
were established several years ago until
such time as it shall decide to disband.
A committee was appointed to procure
grounds and make arrangements for a
picnic, which will be held in Ap il or
May. The s-cretary was instructed to
forward to the Committee on Fish and
Game at Sacramento an amendment to
the present game and fish laws, extending
the open season on wild ducks one month
longer than it is at present, and including
the English snipe in the general law of
protection to game birds. In its letter to
tbe Committee on Fish and Game the as
sociation will sueeest that the open sea
son for trout-fishing remain as it is at
present. It does not approve of the season
remaining closed until May 1, as such a
law wouM be an injustice to the anglers
of this City.

THIEF ARRESTED
Fifty Thousand Dollars'
Worth of Stamps Found
on His Person.
The Government Robbed at the
Rate of $ioo,coo a Year
for Many Years.
Messengers Sent Out to Look for
Bondsmen for a Schemer Now
in ths Law's Clutchrs
..'â¢NEW YORK. N. V.. Feb. 3. â After
years of hard work, it is now said that the
postotfice authorities have succeeded in
. running to earth a band of tnieves which
has been robbing the Government of
stamps at the rate of about $100,000 a
year for many years.
The first arrest was made to-day in this
cliy, and it will be followed up, it is fur
ther said, by the arrest of the others in
. the gang. The man who was arrested in
this city is Hamilton E. Coleman, a clerk
in the cnief clerk's department in the
a "eneral Land Office, He was arrested on
* elegram from Washington. Over $50,
--worth of stamps were found on his
person.
These stamps are known as periodical
â¢ stamps. They ranged in value from one
cent to $60.
A number of three sets of stamps are
s*ent to each Postmaster every year.
When a publishing-house presents one
thousand pounds of published matter, for
instance, the Postmaster gives it a. re
ceipt for the postage paid and cancels
stamps, amounting in full value, to that
sum These stamps are returned can
celed to headquarters in Washington.
A n*w issue of these stamps was ordered
in 1894. Before that time issue had not
been made since about 1875.
â¢The collectors of postage stamps are
eager for the stamps and always have
been, so the stamp* have been stolen and
.sold to them. The face value of the
stamps is $204 57. The market price, it is
raid, has broupht almost twice that
much, so thieves who have been stealing
them have been making sniaii fortunes.
It is"again>t one of the statutes of the
United States to have these stamps in
one's possession, the supposition beinp
naturally that as they are not for circula
' 'uon ani not intended to leave the hands
of the authorities, the persons who have
them must necessarily have stolen them.
Coleman waÂ« taken before Commissioner
Shields. . Postottice Inspector Morris
.made an affidavit that Coleman had re
ceived these stamps from one Randolph J.
Aibn.-t.-ht, and that he had them in his
possession in violation of the United
States laws. The Commissioner set his
examination for next Wednesday and
lixed his bail at $"2000. He sent several
-.messengers out looking for bondsmen.
Coieinan said that he was innocent, that
the stamps were his property and tnat he
> aid prove his innocence.
The detectives in mis city said to-day
that they knew but little about the true
nature of the story behind the arrest.
Ttiey refused to tell who Albrecht was.
. Among other tbinss found in Coleman's
Dockets were a number of envelopes bear
ing the imprint of Burger & Co., dealers
in stamps at 53 Nassau street. Mr. Burger
said to-day thai he did not know Coleman.
KILLING KANSAS JACKS.
Premium on Praire Rabbits Promises to
Make the Race Extinct as Speedily
as Was (he Buffalo.
WICHITA, Kans., Feb. 3.â A new in
dustry has sprung up in Kansas within
the nast few weeks, that of hunting jack
rabbits for their pelts. The pelts find
ready sale at numerous points in the
State, where they are collected and shipped
to hat manufactories in the East. The
discovery that the gay and festive jack
has a commercial value will undoubtedly
lead to the ultimate declaration of a war
of extermination upon him.
The buffalo throve and multiplied upon
the Western plains sa that his numbers
were as i he sands of the sea until he be
came a commodity. Then the market
hunters declared unrelenting war upon
him, and he disapt>earde as in a night.
The Kansas jackrabbit is not constructed
on graceful lines, but, despite his ugliness
and ungainliness, he is one of the pictur
esque features of all typical Drairie scenes,
and he is a great favorite with the coursing
clubs down East on account of his won
derful fleetness. The fur of the jack rab
bit, it has been ascertained, is better
adapted to hat-making than any other
material, and it is because of this fact that
it will soon cease to decorate tne Kansas
landscape. Heretofore no effort has been
k made to save the hides of the millions of
It.i^cks that have been slain by Kansas
hunters. Rabbit-hunters now find added
zest in their favori'e sport, for they are
enabled to dispose of the hides for enough
to yield them a nioe profit, in addition to
â¢ having the usuai amount of enjoyment.

â¢ and Navigation 5 per cent bonds has re
ceived a bid of 45 for all stock neld
by it. conditional upon its acceptance by
.holders of at least $3,000,000, is practically

SNAKES BREATHE DEATH.
They Crawl Up Through a Hole at Night
and Kill Four Members of a
Family.
WICHITA, Kans.. Feb. 3.â A strange
story comes from Buxton in Seward
County. A farmer named John Hastier,
who has a large family, has been four
times bereaved within the last six weeks
from some hitherto inexplicable cause.
First his 3-roonth'3-old daughter was
taken suddenly ill in the night ami died
in convulsions the next tlav. The next
victim of the strange malady was a son.
The following weeK a daughter died, and
within three days another daughter was
taken.
The family was crazed with grief and
feai lest other members should be taken.
Mr. Hastier and some neighbors set
about making investigations to ascertain,
if possible, the reason for the numerous
deaths in the family. One peculiar
feature noted of each case was that the
sickness came upon t he viciirus at night.
The men took up part of the floor and,
while Investigating underneath, came
upon a nest of snakes of a variety known
as blow snakes, whose breath is said to be
a deadly poison. They ki lea seven large
snakes which averaged seven an I a half
feet in length, and there is little doubt
but that ttie snakes were the cause of the
deaths in Mr. Ha>tiers family. It is sup
posed that the snakes crawled up through
a hole in the floor at niglit, attracted by
the warmth, and breathed upon the sleep
ers their noxious breath.

Taylor. On the strength of this Sheriff
Lewis telegraphed to the California

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1897.
AN ASTOUNDING
CRIMINAL CASE
A Young Man's Many Un
successful Attempts
at Murder.
Hired by One Lawyer to Blow
Up the Residence of
Another.
Also Tries to Kill His Stepmother
by the Most Dastardly
Methods.
BLOOMSBURG, Pa., Feb. 3.-One of
the most remarkable criminal cases in
Pennsylvania was brought into court here
yesterday. On September 10 last an at
tempt was made to blow up witL dyiia-,
mite the residence of Hon. Levi E. Waller,
a prominent lawyer of this place. The
attempt vras traced to Clifton Knorr, a
young man of goo 1 family, butof disso
lute habits. Knorrconfessed on his arrest
that he had been hired by Lloyd S. Win
terstein, a lawyer prominent ai tue bar of
this county, and interested in many busi
ness ventures, to blow up Waller's resi
dence for the purpose of killing Waller
and his family.
Winterstein was arrested, and yester
day the Grand Jury lound seven true bills
against Winterstein and Knorr, charging
them with several times attempting to
kill.
A still more dastardly attempt at murder
was confessed by Knorr to-day. He made
a confession that prior to the attempt he
made to blow up Waller's family, Winter
stein nad induced Dim to attempt the
assassination of Waller by shooting him.
Knorr laid In wait for Waller, but the
latter's life was saved by his unexpected
departure from town.
As if this were not enough, Knorr con
fessed to an attemrjt to kill bis step
mother, Mrs. Knorr, and that, too. by
means that only the wildest nctionists
would have thought of. Knorr says that
he twice attempted to poison his step
mother by putting poison in her tea, but
each time by a fortunate chance the at
tempt was frustrated.
Then, on the suggestion of Winterstein,
he wrote to a certain place in New York
City, and there procured the bacilli
of diphtheria with the purpose of
imparting the disease to bis step
mother. When the bacilli arrived
Knorr learned that the only way the
disease could be imparted was by inocula
tion. It was impossible for him lo do this
without his stepmother's knowledge, bat
in the hope that she would contract the
disease, anyhow, he scattered the germs
tbrdugh her clothing. All the-e attempts
at murder arise from a business trans
action in which Winterstein was worsted
by Waller, and in which Mrs. Knorr was
interested.
When the bills from tbe Grand Jury
were returned to court yesterday Winter
stein's counsel aÂ«ked for a continuation.
Tbe prosecution wanted to know on what
grounds tbe continuance was asked for,
but the attorney refused to state, and his
refusal vras sustained by tbe court.
Judge Ikeler, father of coun sel for the
defendant and formerly an intimate friend
of Wintersiein's, is the 3itting Judge. On
this account he telegraphed to Judge
Metz^er of Williamsport to come here to
day and hear the argument for a contin
uance of tbe case.

sented an application for the Italian em
bassy. Mr. Porter is cordialiy indorsed by

Philadelphia Exchange* Action on a
BUI .Vote Before Conrjrctt.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Feb. 3.â At a
special meeting of the directors of the
Maritime Exchange to-day there was a
lengthy discussion on the discriminating
duty bill, now before Congress, and its
probable effect on the shipping interests
of the country. â¢
As a result, it was decided to send a
memorial to the United States Senate pro
testing against the passage of . the bill.
The memorial adopted says:
In the opinion of the Philadelphia Mari
time Exchange, the provisions of this bill, if
enacted, will be disastrous to the shipping
not having the effect sought to be accom
plished, and would destroy rather* than build
up the American merchant marine.
The discriminating duty would encourage
importations Into the United States by rail,
and thus not only build up foreign lines run
ning to Canadian and Mexican ports, but also,
by shutting out foreign steamers at San Fran
cisco, drive traffic from the American trans
continental railways to the Canadian Pacific
Railway. -

only mirth that was provoked during the
session.

About $29,000,000 Will Be Re

Plan for Syndicate Subscriptions and
Reorganiz ition Outlined by
Boston Interests.
BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 3â The Boston
News Bureau say- : Another interest be
sides ttie Union Pacific reorganization
committee will bid for the Union Pacific
property at the foreclosure sale, though
who this party may be is not yet dis
closed. Tliero are no indications that the
Chicago, Burlington and Qnincy Railroad
Company contemplates any such pur
chase, nor does the Chicago and North
wesieru expeci to be a bidder, as it is well
satisfied with present trarncarraiiKements,
which it is expected will be continued
after the sale.
The terms of the syndicate subscrip
tions formed for the reorganization of the
Union Pacific are about as follows: The
subscribers to the first $10,000,000 syndi
cate, and who put up money some time
ago for reorganization expenses, payment
of coupons, etc., are to get bacK their
money with 6 per cent interest and a
bonus of 50 per cent in new preferred
stock. The terms of the second subscrip
tion, made up for $4.000 000, were that
subscribers were to receive new Union
Pacific 4 per c^nt bonds at par and a
bonus of 50 per cent in stock. The recent
modification of the Union Pacific plan,
by which the issue of first mortgage 4 per
cent bonds for the new company is to be
so cut down as to place $25,000,000 bonds
in the treasury of the new company and
leave only $75,000,000 outstanding, was
designed to strengthen the situation of
the new company and give a better posi
tion to botu the bonds and preferred
stock.
Although the reorpanizers of the Union
Pacific have 90 per cent of the first mort
gage bonds purchased O r on deposit, they
had not secured a majority of the sinking
fund 8 per cent bonds at the last meeting
of the committee. But there is reason to
believe that there will be no contest over
the reorganization of the sinking-fund
eights and the Kansas Pacific consols.
Of the latter bonds, the committee held a
majority.
Boston people are the owners of the
largest blocks of these bonds, and they
recognize that, since October, 1595, the
position of junior securities and Nebraska
lands has not improved.
The sinking-fund bonds are secured by
land notes which have diminished in
value the past fifteen months, and the
Kansas Pacific line is still in default on its
first mortgage.
It has not yet been arranged as to how
the United States treasury sinlcing bond
will be pnt up at vendue in the fore
closure 3ale, but about 129,000,000 of net
money from the reorganizes will, it is be
lieved, purchase the entire Government
interest. The first-mortgage bonds will
be taken care of under the plan, so that
not so much money as appears upon the
face of the syndicate subscriptions will be
needed for the reorganization.
SHIPPING LEAD IN BOND.
A New Move That Staggers the Trust
and Revolutionizes Railroad
Transportation.
DENVER, Colo., Feb. 3.â The Times
this afternoon says: Under the supervi
sion of the United States Surveyor of cus
tom foi the port of Denver, a slow but
sure revolution in transcontinental freight
moves is going on.
Last night the Globe smelter shipped
1000 tons of pig lead through the custom
house in bond to Liverpool. On January
18 the Pueblo Smeltin- and Refining
Company shipped 800 ions of pig lead to
Liverpool via Galveston, and these ship
ments have continued at the rate of about
six carloads a day.
Tnis morning* the Gnggenneims, the
Philadelphia Smelting and Retining Com
pany, had their ore house bonded, and
will at once join the movement to Liver
pool of large quantities of lead.
Back of the whole movement is a
scheme to break thtj backbone of the great
and ail-powerful lead trnÂ»t, and millions
oIF dollars are at stake. The trust sought
to freeze out the English owners of the
ereat silver and lead mines in British Co
lumbia.
It declined to buy the output of the
mines, and at the same time advanced the
price of lead the wor.d over. This was a
deiianceand it was substantially backed
by closing the markets in America and
endeavoring to influence the railways and
make it so expensive for the British
Columbia mine-owners that they would
be killed off.
The trust succeeded for a while in keep
ing the ore out of the market, but develop
ment of the country was delayed until
some big syndicate took charge of the
mines in the Kootenai and Slogan dis
tricts and with barrels of cash began the
fight.
Tre mine-owners finally found one road
which has iewer strings on it than the
trans-continental lines, and favorable
rates were made with this line, the Den
ver, Union Pacific and Guil, which made
a special rate on condition that the ship
ments should be made via Galveston, so
as 10 give them a long haul.
Arrangements were made with the
United Stales Custom-house officials so
that the ore. as soon us it crossed the
American line, came under the provision
of the customs officials. Government in
spectors accompanying each shipment
from the international boundary line to
the smelters of Denver and Pueblo.
At the smelters the ore is placed in
bonded warehouses and is smelted and
ref.ned under the eyes of customs officials.
Then, transformed' into bars of pig lead,
it is placed upon the cars of the Union
Pacific. Denver and Gulf, taken to Galves
ton, and under Government inspection 13
placed on board slips.
At Liverpool the market is uncontrolled
by the lead trust, and, being shipped and
bmelted while in bond, it relieves the
owners of the United States duty on the
inipjrted lead.
According to information obtained at
the custora-honse the ore is arriving in
Denver at the rate of about six carloads a
day. Of these two cars go to the Globe
smelter and four are forwarded to the
Pueblo smelter. The ore runs on an
average 100 ounces in silver to the ton, at
the same lime being 80 per ceut lead.

judgment of the court condemning him to
nine months' imprisonment for entering
his trotting mare Bethel in races on Ger

which Kneebs claims is not identical with
tbe mare Nellie Kneebs, was called to the
witness stand.
Professor Eggline testified that the

JOHNSTON'S REPLY
TO THE GOVERNOR
Says Every State Printing
Office Employe Earned
His Wage.
Given LayOffs Only When They
Had Worked Overtime
Without Pay.
Bookkeeper Wallis Declares Johnston
Saved Thousands of Dollars
to the State.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Feb. 3.â State
Printer Johnston, in reply to the charge
made by the Democratic partisans of Gov
ernor Budd to the effect that he had pre
sentt 1 a bill lor work in his office during a
period when the office was shut down, ex
plained to a Call reporter this morning
that during tho busy seasons foremen and
heads of departments worked overtime at
night after doing the full day's work, es
pecially during sessions of the Legisla
ture. For this overtime they were not
paid by the Stale, and in order that the
hard-working employes mightbe compen
sated for the work actually done by
them, Mr. Johnston, who is recognized by
labor organizations as a true friend of the
workingman, ordered that eacn employe
so contributing should be granted a lay-off
without deduction of pay. That had been
the rule of tl.e office as far back as Mr.
Johnston could remember, and it was the
rule in other offices.
These men often worked up to 11 or 12
o'ciock at night and or. Sundays without
extra pay.
Talbot H. Wallis, bookkeeper for the
State Printer, went into the details of the
matter, and showed that by laying off the
men instead of paying them cash for over
time the State had saved between $18,000
and $19,000 during Mr. Johnston's admin
istration, whicii otherwise would have
been paid out for extra time. As a matter
of fact no man had received one dollar
on the payroll without working for it.
With reference to the charge that the
State Printer had discretionary powers
and could refuse to do certain work when
requested, Mr. Johnston said that ?orae
time ago the Legislature passed an act by
which the State Printer was granted dis
cretionary power to revise, cut down, or
refuse to print certain worlf. The Attor
ney-General shortly afterward rendered a
written opinion to the effect that this law
did not affect the reports of State officers
and that the State Printer had no disore
tion whatever with regard to the printing
of such reports. All that was required
was that the work must be ordered by the
State Board of Examiners.
"Wherever there has been an oppor
tunity offered to cut down printing work,"
continued Mr. Johnston, "I have always
done it, but the necessary work must be
performed, because the law requires that
all State printing must be done in the
State Printing Office. With reference to
the charge that I had printed 10,000 school
grammars unnecessarily, I wish to state
that in doing so I simply obeyed the law,
which requires the State Printer to keep
constantly on hand a sufficient quantity of
schooliooks to till all orders. The fact is
that those grammars were printed nearly
a year before the copy for the new
grammar was received at my office. I
rannoc afford to be without textbooks. I
have already sold a large quantity of that
10,000 edition and am receiving orders for
them every day, as they are being used in
the schools at the present time. They
will all be disposed of.
"In making out my bills I fulfill all the
requirements of the law, otherwise they
would not be allowed by the Board of
Examiners, Governor Hudd'j opinion to
the contrary notwithstanding."

CLOSING PLEAS
FOR DUCKWORTH
Evidence All Taken in the
Temporary Roll In
vestigation.
Judson C. Brusie Speaks in
Justification of the Chief
Clerk's Course.
Committee Will Meat in Executive
Session To-Day to Pass Upon
the Findings.
SACRAMENTO, Cai,., Feb. 3.â Tbe
temporary roll scandal investigation was
practically ended this evening by the con
clusion of the taking of testimony. About
half a dozen witnesses were examined.
F. C. Jordan, County Clerk of Alameda,
told bow the appointment ot Wesley
Dixon had been recommended to Mr.
Duckworth, (irant Towle narrated the
manner in which Clerk Duckworth had
stopped payment of the warrants of
Gunzendorfer and Rodriguez, after he had
learned that they had not taken part in
the organization of the Assembly. R. R.
Duckworth and a letter from A. Campbell
of San Francisco explained to the satis
faction of the committee how the name of
Campbell had been omitted from the roll.
Mr. Emmons said that the resolution
creating the committee simply authorized
it to get at the truth ana report it to the
Assembly. It had no authority to find a
verdici or to take any final action in the
matter.
It was decided that, ten minutes would
be sufficient time for the arguments on
each side, and Mr. Chynoweth opened for
the committee. He began by stating that
he desired to call the attention of the com
mittee to a portion of the testimony given
by Mr. Duckworth. The original Jist was
sent to the printer and appeared in the
Journal with one or two names added to
it the next morning. Then he wished to
call attentiou to a letter sent by Duck
worth to the State Printer asking him to
add another name which had been omitted
â that of Rodriguez. The list sent to the
State Printer by Duckworth was the otlicial
list. Afterward he directed the btate
Printer to change the list by the insertion
of another name.
"The point is," continued Mr. Cbyno
wetb, "whether or not that is a mutilation
or an alteration of a public document, and
I would refer you to section 110 of the
Penal Code."
Judson C. Brusie followed with an elo
quent address, in which he poured honey
over the committee and the reporters.
"Not one single question,' 1 he said, "in
the whole course of this investigation has
been asked by us with the hope of bring
ing that response that would shift the
responsibility onto the shoulders of
others. That list, gentlemen of the com
mittee, is more to the credit of the men
â¢who remembered their friends than it is
to their dishonor. It was introduced
against our protest ; it was never intenued
by Mr. Duckworth as a defense, and I will
Bay here that if his defense had depended
upon introducing that iist, it never would
have been introduced by us. He has con
fessed frankly to you that under the so
licitations of the members ana under the
great pressure or the moment, those
names were placed there to pay the debt
of gratitude. He has tried to present his
case without involving any one else, and
we believe that he has succeeded."
Brusie proceeded to say that the sec
retary of the Senate, the clerk of the
Assembly, the minute clerks of both
houses and the two eergeants-at-armb
were obliged by law to go to the Staie
Capitol at each succeeding session and per
form the duties of their offices until their
successors were elected. It designated
those who must return, but it did not
mean that those three alone should par
ticipate in the ceremonies of the occasion.
The statute provided that the permanent
organization of the House should be
effected with eighteen officers and attaches.
Duckworth appointed 108, yet on the per
manent roll tnere are 155.
"Wluo is to say," continued Brusie,
''that you don't know how many are re
quired? and as one honorable gentleman
said, 'There is plenty ot room lor economy
elsewhere during the session besides stop
ping that trifling reward that falU drop
by drop into tue pockets of poor and de
serving men.'
"The people of this State are looking
for general results, not as to who shall be
held responsible for the number of people
appointed under the temporary organiza
tion. There is only one man on ihe
face of the earth who can suffer from the
findings of this committee, and that man
ie S. J Duckworth. Ii there is any pen
alty, if there is a reputation to be sacri
ficed, if there is a pood name to be lost, he
alone mu-t stand it."
The speaker asked that the committee,
when it came to the findings, should not
go behind the question as to whether or
not he committed a fraud. That was ail
that the resolution provided for. Duck
worth had made a fuil, honest confession
to the effect that he had listened to the
importunities of friends in the Assembly
until he himself was appalled by them.
Many men seomed to delight in putting
the blame somewhere, and it unfortun
ately seemed that Duckworth was the
man selected to bear the blame. In mak
ing these appointmeuts tho evidence
showed that Duckworth hat not gained
any advantage in his canvass for 'he cnief
clerkship. Not a single witness had said
tuat the chief clerk had ever approached
him on the proposition of voting for him.
Mr. Brueie justified the practice of reward
ing political friends.
â¢'From the office of President of the
United State?," he added, "down to the
distribution of patronaee in the Cabinet
political services are rewarded. The man
who forgets bis friends is despised by all
men. We know how these men come and
importune us. To go on the temporary
roll is an advantage where there :ire
â everal candidates, and to put one and
not all on the roll would be giving that
one an unfair advantage over his rivals,
and there is no course open to the clerk
except to put them all on. If 108 were
put on, and there are 155 now, it is to
your credit that they are there. It is the
very means by which we are all elected,
and Jt is the very means by which this
country is eoverned. It is true to-day, as
it has ever been, that 'to the victor belongs
thÂ« spoils,' notwithstanding the purity of
elections law. It is a human impulse,
and no law on this earth can prevent it.'
Members of the Legislature, like the
honorable gentlemen that they are, went
upon the stand and acknowledged that
they made these reauebts of the chef
clerk."
On motion of Dr. KeableÃ the commit
tee decided to go into executive session to
morrow to consider the findings of the
committee.

Resolution* to Remedy a Suiaance in
the Yon etui to Valley.
SACRAMENTO, Ca*.., Feb. 3.âAssem
blyman U click this morning introduced
Assembly joint resolution 25, relating to
the purchasing and making free to the
United States Government of the toll
roads passing over the Yosemite National
Park in the State of California. The reao
lutions recites that in 1885 and 1889 the
State purchased and made free portions
of three tollroads in the Yosemite Val
ley, and that in 1890 an act of Congress
was passed establishing the Yosemite
National Park, but it did not provide for
tne making free of the said three tollroads
passing over the National Park and into
theYoseraite Valley, or for the making
tree of the fourth tollroad passing through
the park but not into the valley.
The resolution recites further that the
United States Senate in 1896 authorized
tne purchase and making free of the three
tollroads from their beginnings at the
public highways outside of the National
Park to where they cross the boundary
line of the Yosemite Valley grant, and of
the fourth tollroad from its beginning in

requests the Governor to forthwith trans

WATER TO It THE LAWMAKERS.
Will I>Â« Supplied HUH an Abundance
of Aqua Pur a.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 3.â Waterâ
Blue Canyon water â was the subject of
much persiflage and merriment in the
Senate to-day. Senator Pedlar yesterday
introduced a resolution providing for au
appropriation of $5 a day to provide the
Senate chamber with drinkable water
during the remainder of the session. Toe
resolution was reported favorably to-day
by the committee to which it was referred.
Senator Bulla moved an amendment
that the amount bo reduced to $3 50 a day.
He thought that was a sufficient amount
of money to be expended on water, when
there was no apparent danger of the sun
ply of other thirst-quenching beverages
and liquids giving out.
Senator Morehouse said he was not en
tirely in accord with the resolution, as he
still retained sufficient Democratic prin
ciples to want to take an occasional drink
of something other than â even Blue
Canyon water.
Senator Voorheis also scented danger to
his personal predilections. He mentally
and rapidly figured up that $3 50 would,
at the rate chargedâ 2 cents a gallonâ pay
for 175 gallons of water per day. This, he
pointed out, was in the proportion of about
four and a half gallons of water per day
for each member of the Senate. He con
cluded by saying that the infliction of
such a quantity of water on the members
was a piece of cruelty that would be sure
to evoke indignant protestations from
every humanitarian throughout the State.
The resolution was ultimately passed by
a vote of 27 to 8.
TOO MA* I CLER&&.
ftraunharf* Bill Affecting San Fran
eiteo County Office*.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 3.â By the
bill introduced to-day by Senator Braun
hart several important changes are pro
vided for in the matters of the clerical
force and salaries in the county offices of
San Francisco.
The number of reeister clerks drawing
$175 per month is reduced from twelve to
four, those drawing $150 per month are
reduced lrom twenty-four to thirteen, and
the number of copyists is changed from
thirty-six to fiftesn, but the salaries of the
latter are increased from $3 per day to $100
per month. Two changes are contem
plated in the Sheriff's office: Tho book
keeper's salary is to bo reduced from $JSO
to $.'OO, and the assistant bookkeeper's re
muneration is to be increased from $100 to
$150. These changes would effect a saving
to the county oi $4250 per month, 0r551,000
a year.
Another important new feature is in
cluded in the measure which provides
that when clerks are not engaged in their
regular duties they may be aesigned to
other work.
ZXTO THE WAHIKBASKBT. '
One of Senator Bert* Bill* Cornea to an
Ignoble l.n I.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 3â Senator
Bert made a public confession of lack of
judgment or incompetency on the floor
to-day. His bill providing for the ap
pointment of a Japanese interpreter for
the criminal courts of San Francisco at a
salary of $150 a month came up for third
reading. It had been attacked on second
reading as being unnecessary and aÂ« sim
ply providing a soft place for Â»<>me fa
vored individual. Bert made a strenuous
defense ot the measure at that time and
was most emphatic in declaring that the
need of a Japanese interpreter was most
urgent.
There promised to be another attack on
the Dill on third reading, so making a vir
tue of necessity Bert, when his bill was
reached on the file, asked permission to
withdraw it. He remarked that a con
ference with some of the Police Judges of
San Francisco had convinced him that
his bill wouid not provide for "a long-felt
want." There being no objection the biil
was unostentatiously dropped into the
wastebJuket.

CARSON, Nev., Feb. 2.â The dispatches
from San Francisco announcing that
United States Judge McKenna and others
bad declared mat the Federal Government
had no right to interfere to prevent the
Corbett-Fitzsimmons rieht in Nevada has
caused great rejoicing here. Nothing now
stands between Carson and the great pu
gilistic event that will bring thousands of
visitors and thousands of dollars to the
city.
Virginia City is putting in a strong bid
for the right, offering $10,000 caoh. The
Enterprise prints a list of hotel and lodg
ing-houses on the Comstock and the num
ber of people they can hold, giving an es
timate of 15,000 in all. The lighters tdem
selves, however, are to be considered, and
neither will consent to iiirbt at such a great
elevation. It is nearly 7000 feet above the
â ea level, and the pugilists would be com
pletely winded in a few rounds.
Tbe bill introduced by Senator Mills to
reduce the rate of admission will probably
be allowed to sleep its sleep in the com.
mittee and never be called up.
To-day James Gordon Bennett of the
New York Herald engaged rooms at the
Ormsby House for three of his staff, to be
occupied on March 1, and the suite usually
set apart for United States Senatorial can

Old Article* of Agreement Destroyed at
Hi* /!<q%i**t. - , "
NEW YORK. S. V., Feb. 3.â There was
an exciting scene in the cafe of the Hotel
Bartholdi to-night in which Bob Fitzsim
.mons, Martin Julian and a friend of Al'
Smith were the central figures. . ._ - t
The upshot of the matter was the -tear?
ing up of the original articles of asree> ..
ment signed by Corbett and Fitzsimmons
on September 12 of last year. Julian de
stroyed the articles. "'*." '"' '
Al Smith, who is final stakeholder, sent
the old articles by a friend to Julian to
ask if they, as amended, were agreeable to
Aim, ana if the clause in the articles rela
tive to the payment of certain money due
sixty days prior to the contest waa satis
factory. The amendment, which -waÂ»
written on the articles outside this State,
reads as follows:
By mutual consent theie articles are hereby
changed to cover the contest set for March 17,
1897, to take place in the State of Nevada or
elsewnere, under tbo supervision of Daa
Stuart. Jamls J. Corbett.
Per William A. Brady.
Fitzsimmons -wishes to go on record as say
ing that he will be ready to fight Corbett at
any place and time Dan Stuart may select on
March 17, 18'J7.
[signed.] Martin Julian,
for Bob Fitjzimmons.
Julian, who was with a parly of friends
in the cafe of the hotel, read the amend
ments carefully and said that they were
perfectly satisfactory to him. The gentle
man delegated by Smith to convey the
articles to Julian placed the papers in bis
pocket and was about to leave when Fitz
simmons came in.
He asked to see the articles. They were
passed over to him and he read them.
"I don't approve of those articles at all,"
said Fitzsimmons, turning to Julian after
he had finished reading, "and I wish you
to tear them up."
Julian took the papers in his band and
tore them in pieces, while Smith's repre
sentative stood by, lookine slightly embar
rassed. He remonstrated, but it was too
late; the articles were already destroyed.
So the only thing left for him to do was
to take it good-naturedly and depart
empty-handed.
Later Smith and Julian had a confer
ence, and both said afterward that every
thing had , been arranged satisfactorily.
The articles destroyed will not affect the
coming battle in Nevada. The articles
governing the contest aro in the posses
sion of Dan Stuart. After destroying the
articles Julian eaid:
"When those articles were signed there
were five copies iv existence. Four were
destroyed ; for what reason and by whom
I do not know. I tried to secure a copy,
but up to the present time was unsuccess
ful. Fitzslmmons is under $1000 bonds
for signing articles in the State of New
York, .and says he has no desire for fur
ther trouble."
Julian will leave for Carson City on
Sunday to select training quarters for
Fitzsimmons. The latter will start for
the battleground on Wednesday.
"Bill" Edwards offered to bet $1000 to
$800 that Corbett would defeat Fitzsim
mons.
CRAIG AND fRAIK
111 WARM DEBATE
| Continued from Tirtt Foot. \
Francisco Board of Trade, were accredited
delegates of that body. He read the fol
lowing letter addressed to Captain T. H.
Barber, one of tbe pilots, ia proof of his
sensational charge:
In reply to your question I will state that
the committee, composed of George Dickey
and J. N. Knowles, appointed to confer with
tho Ship-owners' Association regarding a re
duction of pilotage, dues, charges, etc., is not
au eppointment irom the Board of Trade of
San Francisco. This board has not appointed
any committee for any such pnrpoie. Yours
respectfully, H. l. Smith, Secretary.
Craig again assumed the appearance of
being threatened with a stroke of apo
plexy, and attempted to explain the pres
ence of these gentlemen's names on tbe
San Francisco committee of commerce by
saying they represented the Manufactur
ers' and Producers' Association. Frank
led and landed again by asking who were
the representatives of the Board of Trade.
"X decline to answer," blurted out the
now thoroughly exasperated and confused
insurance agent. Being courteously
pressed for a civil answer to a civil ques
tion, he stated that T. J. Parsons and Mr.
Esberg of Esberg, Bachrnan & Co., repre
sented the Board of Trade, despite the
fact that the official communication from
that organization distinctly stated that no
such delegates had been appointed.
Craig lost control of his temper entire ly
at this juncture, but was recalled to a
calmer state by Chairman Cleaves of the
Senate Committee on Commerce suggest
ing that he take a Sunday off and settle
his personal differences. Craig pleaded to
be recognized as being properly before the
committee, and his prayer was granted,
more to humor him than because of any
impression made on the committee by his
representations.
Frank then argued that the present
pilotage system was no hardshipon Amer
ican shipping, and showed by authentic
statistics thai less than 5 per cent of all
tbe sailing vessels engaged in grain-carry
ing, coming ana going from San Fran
cisco, were of American register. He
claimed that any reduction mad* in pilot
age fees would only be patting that much
more money into the pockets of Ameri
can ship-owners. He ahowed also that
the principal business of vessels owned in
this State was the carrying of lumber, and
that for more loan a year past not a score
of lumber vessels had sailed from San
Francisco, while several hundred had
sailed from other coast towns.
He also demonstrated how the reduction
of pilotage charges would benefit the
foreign vessels now engaged in the coal
carrying trade between this port and
Nanaimo, B. C, to the detriment of the
American vetsels bringing coal to this port
from Seattle.
'â¢The present Jaw," he went on, "is
working satisfactorily, except to few dis
gruntled ship-owners. I don't impute any
bad intentions or bad faith to the gentle
man who is here advocating the new law s ,
but I do think be is an enthusiast and has
been misled. HÂ« has got into a fight, and
U I mistake not a fight to him is as the
breath to his nostrils. I am afraid he is
being carried off his feet."
When the langhter that followed these
effectively mollifying words had subsided
he submitted the following letter, ad
dressed to one of the pilots, from a gen
tleman who, he said, had for years been
master of one of the White Star steamers
and was now Lloyd's agent at San Fran
cisco:
Being requested by you to express an opin
ion as to the merlin of tbe pilotage system and
pilou of this portl beg to say that I consider
your body aÂ« second to none in its standing
and the service good and sufficient, and I am
â ure the pilots of San Francisco have been of
great assistance to the shipping entering this
port on many occasions.
I should be sorry to see its efficiency im
paired by any reduction in the income of the
pilots of this port, whose duties are trying
and hazardous, especially during the winter
months, and I think experience generally
shows that a service that Is poorly paid will
In time degenerate into a poor service and so
Increase the risk of entering this port, which
I take for granted is extremely undesirable.
J am, yours faithfully,
1. Metcalfe, Marine Surveyor.
When Frank concluded, Craig again
took the floor and read a petition from a
number of San Francisco shipowners in
favor of the proposed bill. He was asked
wny some of the most prominent ship
owners and largest payers of pilotage had
Dot signed the document. Hie answer was
a tirade of abuse on those who bad de
clined to let an insurance agent be tpeir
spokesman in a matter about which he
could not nave, by reason of his calling,
any practical knowledge.
Senator Gillette asked Craig what the
pilotage charges were in Boston, but
Craig was not prepared with this informa
tion. Instead be submitted the pilotage
charges of such Insignificant ports as
Pictou, Nova Scotia, Leghorn, some port
in Iceland to which a ship possibly came
twice a twelve month, and others of equal
unimportance.
It was developed, however, by inquiry
among the members of the Senate Com
mittee themselves that Boston. New York
and Philadelphia bad the same system
ami the name charges as San Francisco.
In conclusion, Frank showed that there
were over 100,000 tons of disengaged ship
ping in the harbor of San Francisco. He
cited this to prove that vessels were not
de. erred in any degree from going to that
harbor by reason of the pilotage charges.
it was now 11 p. m. and the committee,
in hopes of being able to dispose of the
bill to-night, went into executive session,
but after sitting for three-quarters of an
hour, decided to let the matter go over
until 3 p. m. to-morrow.

Slurring Tjtinguage Used by â  Ita Author
in Defending the Meature.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. aâ Cinch
bill No. 336 was the subject of prayerful
consideration to-night by the Assembly
Committee on Public Morals, Sig. Bett
man chairman. The bills is aimed at
the industry of breeding thoroughbred
racing horses, and' is in the interest
of the breeders of standard- bred trotting
stock.
Running races have become so popular
by reason of the dash and excitement
which attend the derby and other holi
day gatherings when contrasted with the
cameness of trotting race*, which often
tause so much disappointment - when the
favorite breaks, that the trade in trotters,
ezceDt for the plow and sand-cart service,
has languished.
Mr. Emmous' bill is ostensibly, with a
diagram, designed to prevent gambling
on horse racing by allowing horses to race
in California during the summer for but
thirty days at a time in any one county.
From the first of December until the
first of March, the season of the crack
mud-runners, when crackerjack trotters
from Bakerstield are under a serious dis
advantage, no horses will 'be allowed to
run in the mud of San Francisco or Ala
meda or on the alkali but fertile plains of
Bakersneld.
Emmons wept rhetorical tean over the
vice of gambling. He argued, without
choking or laughing outright, that, the
stoppage of racing during the winter
season would prevent gambling, and pa
thetically mentioned as a fact that at the
Ingleside and Oakland racetracks twenty
Dook making firms each pay $100 per day
to the management for the privilege of
allowing sporting people to bet on their
favorites.
During; the course of his remarks, Mr.
Eramons mentioned the names of Daniel
M. Burns, Adolph Spreckels, Thomas H.
Williams and Ed Corrigan in what Chair
man Bettman considered a slurring way,
and when Mr. Emmona asked that the
committee should report favorably upon
the bill, Bettman said that the committee
would take no action until tbe gentlemen
representing tbe San Francisco and Ala
meda County racetracks had a hearing
before the committee.
Bettman was very indignant over the
matter and said to a Call reporter after
the meeting that he thought more of the
gentlemen mentioned by Mr. Emmons
than he did of the people wno favored the
bill.

SHACKLED AFTER A
FIERCE STRUGGLE
New Hop 3's Desperate Dual
Murderer Landed in
Prison.
Thrilling Experience of Constable
McCulloch, Who Made the
Arrest.
Fight for Lifa Turned in Favor of
the Officer by the Arrival of
Two Citizens.
â¢
STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. 3.â Sheriff Cun
ningham ana Constable McCulloch re
turned at about 11 o'clock this forenoon
by train, bringing to the county jail Mur
derer Kleapfer, who is without doubt one
of the most desperate criminals that have
ever been in custody in this county.
The story of his capture is thrilling
enough for the most blood-curdling of
yellow-covered novels. Constable McCul
loch showed himself to be a man of
the bravest type, and it was owing to his
fearlessness and cunning combined that
Kleupfer was made a prisoner.
After the shooting the murderer walked
up to the bar of the saloon from whicn he
had been shortly before ejected and in a
tone of bravado called for a drink. Robert
Kirkland happened to be behind the bar
in that momsnt of confusion and, hastily
and nervously passing out a bottle of
whisky, he told Kleupfer that he could
have anything in the place. The assassin
took a big drink of whisky. Kirkland
does not know how much he drank, but
he was sure that it was good- measure.
The murderer then went over to his own
barrrom and reloaded his revolver.
Constable McCullough was on his way
back from Lodi while the shooting was go
ing on and he arrived at New Hope about
ten minutes afterward. By that time
Kleupfer had returned to his own barroom
and, with pistol In Hand, was waiting for
whatever might Happen. McCullough
entered the saloon, but he could not draw
his gun and very discreetly left it in bis
pocket, for Kleupfer would have killed
him the moment he entered the place had
he made any show of fighC
For nearly two hours Kleupfer com
pelled the Constable at the point of a pis
tÂ«l to tend bar. At the expiration of that
time Kleupfer and McCullough found
themselves sitting beside each other, about
four or rive feet apart.
Kleupler was next to the bar and the
constable was sitting to his left. Kleupfer
held nis pistol in his left hand, pointing
it at the officer. Nothing was said and
both men were motionless. For a mo
ment Kleupfer took his eyes off the offi
cer and they seemed to droop. It was the
first reiaxaiion he had had for over an
hour. It was just momentary, but long
enough. In an instant ne reeled from the
chair, muttering 'â¢You've got me."
The constable had snatched his own
pistol with his right band from the front
leftside of bis trousers, and, swinging his
right arm from him, struck the murderer
a stunning blow just above the ayes.
A big gash was cut and one of the eyes
was badly discolored and lacerated.
Kleupfer was dazed, but only for an in
stant. He made a desperate effort to re
gain his feet, fumbling in the meantime
witn his revolver. But the officer, al
though a pretty old man, was agile and
dextrous, and Kleupfer no sooner reeled
from his chair than the officer was upon
him, the two struggling for their lives on
the floor.
Just then two of the townspeople.named
A. W. Fitzgerald and Walter Rutherford,
came to the porch of the saloon, and see
ing the murderer and the officer strug
gling inside rushed to the Constable's as
sistance.
Others also hastened to the scene, and
soon Kleupfer was overpowered. He
fought to the last with all his mignt ana
main, not giving in while any strength
was left him, and not being a bit affected
by the hopelessness of his struggle.
After he was handcuffed he stilJ fought,
and when Sheriff Cunningham and
Deputy Wall arrived three men were
exerting their full strength to hold him
down. If he had broken away he might
have done deadly wort by striking right
and left with the handcuffs.
After his arrest the murderer said he
intended also to kill his two partners in
business, Louis Landecker, a Bavarian
ana Cerf Coblentz, a Frenchman. The
latter went to San Francisco yesterday,
and tbe former hid when he heard what
Kleupfer had done.

Why the University Should He Exempted
From Taxation.
SACRAMENTO, Cai*. Feb. 3.â Senator
Voorheis is in receipt of a forcible argu
ment from Professor David S. Jordan of
the Stanford University on the subject of
exempting that institution of learning
from taxation. It will be utilized on the
first opportunity by the recipient. The
communication, which is a model of terse
ness, logic and philosophy, is as follows:
The basis on which the Stanford University
asks exemption from- taxation is that under
the law it is a public school and under the
constitution it ought not to be taxed â 
Stanford University is founded under an act
of the Legislature which provides that its en
dowment funds shall only be used for public
education. The act prohibits sectarian teach
ing, and provides that the Institution shall be
open to all alike and as nearly as may be free
of cum* go.
The act further provides that if the trusts.
shall not faithfully manage the trust the si"
shall take direct possession of the iustUutioa
and manage it as a State university. Its prop-
II"?? are thus held in trust for State purposes
By its foundation It is a public scnoofand
comes within, the clause of the constitution
referring to the establishment of technical
schools. The position of its board of trusees
?hÂ«i?^"h PU .K UC f CorporÃtlon is '""herem
phasized by the fact that under the grant of
endowment the Individual trustees are re
movable by a State court of equity, and they
are required to file annually with the Gover
"Â°onrforth S eVe ar. Btatement Â° f tbeir Â«â
These facts take the Stanford University out
of n the category ot v private institutions and
range it alongside the BUte University the es
sential difference being that it has i,ot and
should not ask appropriation's from the State
- The question of taxing private institutions
and denomination^ schools Is another UeÃ
tion. As to this I need : only say that Cavort
nlais the only State that taxes college* .No
community has ever suffered from the excel
lence of its schools, and every dollar the col
leges spend in the State helps its development
more than a hundred dollars spent lath*
course of business. Â° Â» n the

CAPTURE OF SUM BIRCH.
T \N::or/eus Alaskan Desperado Taken
â¢'â¢ .: ifter Killing One Officer and
'. Wounding Two Others.
â¢ ; FORT TOWNSI.ND, Wash., Feb. 3 â
â¢ â J-jH'tri â  irci>, one of Alaska's most notorious
: desperadoes, Â»no escaped from jail at
Juneau a .month ago on the eve of his
â  transportation 10 San Quentin prison in
Caltlornia to serve a three-year term under
â¢ sentence on a charge of mayhem, has been
recaptured, but this undertaking cost
â Alaska the life of one of her bravest and
best known officers and entailed the seri
ous bounding of two others who partici
pated in the bloody pitched battle that
â¢followed the meeting of pursuers and pur
sued. ' â¢
Oh the night before the Al-Ki sailed on
her trip previous to this one three masked
men cailed at the jail in Juneau where
Birch was confined and forced the jailer
not only to unlock Birch's cell but to go
- in and oe locked up himself.
Since the sensational jail delivery an
I bine c the search has been kept up with
-1 -eminent search has bet-u kept up with
out results until the middle of last week,
when- the prisoner and his three com-
panions were reported by an Indian to be
occupying a cabin on a small island thirty
miles, irom Juneau. A posse was at once
â â¢formed, headed by Marshal Hale and in
cluding Deputy 'William Watts, Jailer
'' Lndquist and an Indian policeman, who
-' went to the island in a steam launch.
â¢. The laborious trip over the roughest
kind of country covered with snow and .
fee brought the party to the cabin. Watts
. went to -.the door and demanded admit
tance. ' The reply was four ride bails, two
of which pierced the unfortunate man,
who reeled down behind two logs for pro
tection. While lying there he was shot
.â¢gain by two of the outlaws, who in the
, excitement were allowed to escape from
the cabin to a rocky eminence near by, j
from which they poured a leaden shower 1
en the beads of the officers.
â¢ The fusillade continued five minutes,
when, the posse broke and ran for the
. launch, three miles distant, returning
post haste to Juneau and leaving poor
Watts at the mercy oi the desperadoes
.and 'severe weather, from the effects of
wbicij, iater developments showed, the
: brave fellow died.
Next day a second party left Juneau,*
â¢but returned the following morning
*B>pty-iianded and frost-bitten. A gen
eral man hunt was then inaugurated, par
ticipated in by the people of Juneau,
Â£itk\a and the neighboring canneries. To
two big fellows employed in a cannery,
named Olson and Cheney, belong the
credit and reward, $500, for making the
capture.
â¢' â¢ Alter the killing the desperadoes sepa
rated". Slim and a man named Shell, who
robbed the Tread well mill some years
ago. going together to the upper end of
the island, where they sought reÂ«t and
.food at an Indian cabin, and later making
their way to a narrow gully where both
went asleep, each with a revolver in hand
ready for use on a moment's notice. To
this retreat O.son and Cheney tracked
'them, effecting the capture in a novel
.mariner.
." First assuring themselves that both men
a^irep the cannery nun climbed by
\^ roundabout trail to a point twelve feet
'^above and then jumped bodily on to the
Ble<>pinjr murderers, wno were manacled
"before they had recovered from their sur
prise at the human avalanche which
struck them. The men were relieved of
tbe weapons with which they were armed
and hurried over to the United States
Kramer Pinta, upon which they were
taken â¢â  to Sitka, fear* of a lynching bee
prompting < be oflicera not to attempt to
re; urn to Juneau.
Â°" When the Al-Ki left the excitement was
at a lujjh pitch, and it is very probable
that both men have bern hanged ere this.
W atjts, the murdered man, was looked
upon as the bravest marshal in the Terri
tory. Marshal Hale was shot through the

Lot Angela' Mayor Appeal* in Behalf j
of thr Unemployed,
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 3.â Mayor ]
Snyder seems determined to redeem his
ante-election pledges to all he could to
ameliorate the hard lot or the poor and
needy of the city. He sent a message to
the City Council yesterday, which, in part,
was as 'follows:
The question of providing work for the un
empio>ed of the city is becoming â¢ serious
one. It is a question thai appeals to the hearts
of all and which should, in my opinion,
receive early and serious consideration at
your hands. While the percentage of unem
ployed in Los Angeles is very small, as com
pared with other coast and Eastern cities, yet
there is destitution enough to make It abso
lutely necessary that we act In this matter and
as early ms possible.
I see no reason why the streets in the busi
ness portion of the city should not be swept by
hand, thus giving employment to a larger
number ot men than are now in the street
sweeping service. The cost of the work would
probably be not much more than under the
present system. The streets of many of the
large Eastern cities are swept by hand. This
system hat been found to be economical and
very satisfactory, and, besides, gives employ
ment to many men. I sincerely trust that
your honorable body will take* steps at once
in this matter of street sweeping, and tha: you
will see to it that only married men, deserv
ing and industrious, are employed.
Tbe voting of bonds for improving our park
system Is a question which presents itself
most seriously to us at this time when so many
are seeking employment. If bonds were voted
for this purpose, the serious problem now con
fronting us would be solved to a considerable
extent. - .

Mrs. Jltar't Â«T Pierce Become* the Owner
of a Piece of Valunbte Property.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Feb. .3.â An im
portant decision has been handed down by
Superior Judge F. SI. Angellotti'of Mann
County, by which Mrs. Mary J. Pierce
becomes the 'owner of one of the finest
ranches in California, known as the Pierce
ranch, and containing 2500 acres of land.
The case of Jewell et al versus Pierce et al,
in which the decision was rendered, con
tained interesting legal complications, and
eminent counsel was employed to conduct
the proceedings.
Abram Pierce, when he died, was sur
vived by a widow and by William S.
Pierce, a son by a former marriage. He
owned at tliat lime one-half of the ranch
which he bequeathed to his widow, the
other half being owned by his motner,
Sarah C. Pierce. William S. Pierce suc
ceeded to the property of his grandmother,
Sarah C. Pierce, on her death. When
WlUiam G. Pierce died at Petalurna a
year ago Mrs. Mary J, Pierce, his step
mother, succeeded to the property under
his will. Thus Mrs. Pierce has co'aie into
full possession of the great ranch. She is
at present in Australia, whither she was
compelled to go on account of her health,
and does not know of the decision which
places her in possession of the big ranch.
LOS ANGELES CHARITY ASTRAY.
Chief of Police Glass Dec/ares That the
Good Samaritan Hospital Is
an Evil.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 3.âAccord
ing to the views expressed by Chief Glass
at a meeting of the Police Commissioners
of thus city yesterday, the Good Samari
tan Hospital, conducted by Captain Fra
zier, and over which some of the Jocal
newspapers have employed so much ink
of late, Is a veiled and disguised evil. Re
â¢pecting this philanthropic institution
Chief Glass said:
"Gentlemen. I recognize the humane
idea of the manager of the institution anl
the fact that he believes he is doing what
is best, but to mind it is a mighty bad
thine for the city. It is advertised ail
over the land to the beggars, toughs and
tramps that they can get a meal and bath
there for 5 cents, and the result is an in
flux of a most undesirable element to our
already large quota of unemployed. We
never liad so many beegars in tn'is city as
have now. If it could be arranged to help
only our own resident poor, who deserve
â¢and should receive help, it would be an
other matter, but as it is the Samaritan
institution is a bid thing for Los An eles."
General Forman emphasized the Chief's
ideas, fully concurring, and remarked
that the public was misplacing much of
it* sympatoy ior such cause?, especially
where unemployed were shouting for $2 a
day if they worked for the city. Mayor
Snvder agreed with General Forman, as
did Commissioner AlcLain. The latter
complained that from a half dozen to ten
beggars came to his bouse each morning
from the institute. If they could beg 10
or 25 cents that fixed them for a couple of
days at the institute.
FRESNO JURORS DISAGREE.
Unable to Decide Whether or Mot Sanders
Forged the Name of William
Wootton.
FRESNO, Cal.. Feb. 3.â The case of the
people against Professor W. A. Sanders,
charged with forgine William Wootton 's
name to a $1400 draft, was submitted to
the jury without argument this forenoon.
The jury is still out and it is almost cer
tain that it wiii not agree.
It is reported that it stands eight for
conviction and four for Acquittal. The
inability of the jury to reach an agree
ment is commented on generally as a sur
prise. Few people believe in the inno
cence of Sanders. The prosecution Is now
very sorry that it did not argue the case.
"But we thought that the facts were so
plain," said Attorney Hinds to a Call
correspondent, "that the jury would
not think of any doubt as* to the
defendant's guilt. District Attorney Snow
and I were convinced that the twelve
men would see tne case in our light, and
we therefore were willing to submit with
out argument "
The attorney then went on to express
the opinion tnat the jury system was Â»
arce anyway. The jury retired until
morning after reporting this evening to
the court that there was little prospect 01
agreeing.
This was the third trial of Sanders. In
the rim the jury disagreed, but in the sec
ond it convicted him. The District Attor
ney has several other charges of forgery to
prefer against :he man who is suspected
of having murdered William Wootton,
and Sanders will in all likelihood De kepi
behind the bars for the remainder of his
days.

CONGRESSIONAL
PROCEEDINGS
Senator Thurston Discusses
the Question of Fore
closure.
Vilas Makes a Long Argument
in Opposition to the Nica
ragua Canal Bill.
By Concurrent Resolution Wednesday
Next Is Set for Counting the
Presidential Vote.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.â ln the
Senate to-uay an enormous floral struc
ture, on which the word "Honor"' was
marked, stood upon the desK of Dubois
I K. ) of Idaho, who had just returned
froDi his unsuccessful campaign for re
election, and who was warmly welcomed
back by Senators of ali parties.
A bill permitting Major-General Alex
McCook and Captain Georee Schnver,
U. S. A., to accept medals from the Rus
sian Government was passed.
The resolution heretofore offered by
Allen (P.) o i â¦Nebraska looking to the de
lay or prevention of the judicial sale ol
the property of the Union Pacific .Rail
way Company was taken up, and Tnurs
ton (R.) of Nebraska aadre-sed the Senate
on the subject. He quoted decisions of
the Supreme Court of the United States
to the effect that the Thurman act applied
only to those portions of the Union and
Central Pacific roads on which guarantee
bonds had been issued.
The Government of the United States
bad never issued guarantee bonds on the
Kansas Pacific or on the Denver Pacific,
wlio-c united lines extended from Kansas
City tv Cheyenne, and therefore, in deal
ing with the present situation there was
but one corporate entity (the Union Pa
cific), while there were three separate and
distinct legal entities. In regard to the
Omaha bridge and its approacbes, a new
act of Congress had authorized tbe Union
Pacific Company to issue $2,500,000 in
bonds for that purpose. Tne bridge had
cost about that sum, but a new doable
track bridge costing about $1,000,000 had
lx>en built nine or ten years ago. These
bridge bonds had been paid from time to
time, until now only about $1,000,000 of
tiiem was due. It therefore happened
that the Omaha bridge and all the ap
proaches on the east side of the Missouri
River were not covered by any Govern
ment lien, and all the terminals, all the
sidetracks and all tbe bridges were cov
ered by the iirst-mortgage bor.ds of the
company. The Jien of the Government,
Mr. Thurston asserted, was subordinate
to tbe lien of the first mortgage, which
had the right of foreclosure and tbe right
to take possession of the property.
He had no doubt that the United States
could supplement its lien by subrogating
itself for the mortgage, but that was to be
looked at from a business point of view.
The offer made to tbe Government, Mr.
Thurston said, would amount to some 56
or ">7 per cent ol its entire claim and the
question was whether it would not be bet
ter to accept than offer to pay $36,000,000
for 1032 miles of railroad in ordtr to go
into the railroad business.
Morgan (D.) of Alabama asked Thurs
ton whetber be held that the executive
branch of the Government had the right
to make any bargain or agreement such
as had been suggested.
Tburston said he made no such claim.
He had serious doubts whether Con
gre*s could create a new Federal cor
poration to operate the Union Pacific
railroad. When tbe original incorpora
tion was made the roa.i was run through
the Territories of the United States. Now
all those Territories were sovereign States,
rind in them, at least, there were consti
tutional prohibitions against the owner
snip of land or the operation of railroads
by any other than a domestic corporation.
In the discussion of the question of fore
closure suits be was asked by Allen (Pop.)
of Nebraska whether the Attorney-Gen
eral had a riant, by virtue of his office and
without any authority from Congress, to
bind the Government by putting in an ap
pearance in these foreclosure suits.
The reply of Thurston was that the
right of the Attorney-General to appear
in anr suit in which the Government bad
an interest was absolutely beyond ques
tion, irrespective of any of the legislation
on tbe subject. He added that the Gov
ernment could be brought into court by
order of the court, and that that had been
done in these foreclosure suits. He ad
mitted that Congress might take jurisdic
tion over these suits from the Circuit
Court, but what a wanton, unauthorized,
despotic use of power that would be. Now,
when the uttermost rights of the Govern
ment were in possession of its own courts,
who was it, or what business interests was
it, that said. "No, no; bring this back into
Congress. Make it once more a theme of
political agitation, as it has been for tne
pa*t twenty years?"
Thurston was still speaking when tbe
morning hour expired (at 2 o'clock), and
the unftnished business â the Nicaragua
catial bill â was laid before the Senate.
Notice was given by Lodge (R.) of Mas
sachusetts that he would ask action to
morrow oi: the conference report to the
immieration bill.
Under the rules the Allen resolutions
would have gone to the calendar, but Al
len asked that they remain on the table.
It was well understood, he said, that no
other business but appropriation bills
would be transacted this session. The
bankruptcy bill was in the last stages of
consumption, and the Nicaragua canal
bill was about ready to be nailed up and
put in itscotfni.
Allen's request met with no objection,
and the resolutions remain on the Vice-
President's table.
Gear (R.) of lowa, chairman of the Pa
cific Railroads Committee, cave notice
that as soon as the Nicaragua canal bill
and the bankruptcy bill were disposed of
he would ask the Senate to consider the
biil for a settlement of the Pacific rail
roads indebtedness.
The consideration of the Nicaraguan
canal bill was then proceeded with.
Morgan (D.) of Alabama, in charge of
tbe bill, accepted with some slight modifi
cations the amendment offered yesterday
by Teller (R.) of Colorado, providing that
no bonds should be guaranteed until after
a survey was made and a complete plan
was accepted by the President and that no
liability should be assumed by the Gov
ernment if the coÂ«t of the canal should
appear to exceed $150,000,000.
Vilas(D.)of "Wisconsin resumed his ar
gument against the bill. In the course of
an hour and a half there were three calls
of the Semite in ord^r to compel Senators
to hear the areu men t. but just as soon and
as often us a quorum was obtained it laded
away again.
Vilas. however, went on with his speech.
In the course of it he was reminded by
Morgan t..at the Nicaragua canal project
had been indorsed by s veral Democratic
National conventions. This fact was
brusbed aside contemptuously by Vilas,
as "an idle expression introduced into a
party platform," and he said that a simi
[ lar indorsement iiati been put in Kepub>
lican platforms. Most probably the agents
of the company had been working upon
the resolutions committee of the conven
tions; but siich declarations were utterly
without binding force upon anybody.
"Tnen lam glad, 1 ' Morgan remarked,
'that! never was a member of a National
convention; but I still hope that I would
come out of it au honest man."
Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts put a ques
tion to Vilas as to whether Presidential
nominations in political conventions were
effected in a similar manner.
"Never, 10 my knowledge," Vilas re
plied. "Candidates are sometimes nom
inated under excitement, but in no con
vention that I ever attended was any can
didate nominated whom I did not cor
dially support and favor." After a pause
he added, "Except one."
Alter two or three calls of the Senate,
each disclosing the presence of a quorum
the presiding officer laid before the Senate
the House concurrent resolution for tha
counting of the Presidential vote on
Wednesday next, and it was agreed to.
Subsequently Turpie (D.) of Indiana
took exception to the wording of the con
current resolution, which is that the per
son receiving the highest number of votes
shall he "declared president," while the
constitution, he said, read he should "be"
President; but Mr. Hoar explained that
that point bad been made eight years a^'O
by Senator Edmunds of Vermont and had
been overruled.
Turpie did not press his objection.
Vilas then went on with his speech, in
which he treated at considerable length
and with much detail the provisions of
the Clay ton-Bulwer treaty and how they
affected the question of an isthmian canal,
and discussed various other historical in
cidents having a bearing on the same
Question.
After another half hour a motion to ad
journ was made by Daniel (D.) of Vir
ginia and was defeated â ayes 17, noes 24.
As the vote indicated the absence of a
quorum â several Senators who were pres
ent being paired â the roll was anain
called and forty-one Senators responded â
still four less than a quornm. The usual
motion directing the serjeant-at-arms to
request the attendance of sbsent BenntOrs
was made by Aldrich (R.) of Rhode
Island and agreed to, and pending its
execution all business of the Senate came
to a standstill.
After a short wait Aldrich said it was
very evident that a quornm could not be
pqt to-night, and then at 5:20 o'clock the
Senate adjourned until to-morrow.
SWAXSOS Sl.AIl.If JA TBE BOUSE.
A. Confuted .Election Cast That Occupies
a Day* Station.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3â The
discussion of the contested election casa
ot George W. Cornett vs. Claude A. Swan
son, from the Fifth District of Virginia, oc
cupied nearly the whole of to-day's
session of the House, and by an over
whelming vote Swanson's title to the seat
was confirmed by the House. The case
cam 3 from the Committee on Elections
No. 3, which reported in favor of Swan
son. Three Republicans, half the ma
[ jority membership, however, recom
- mended that the seat be declared vacant
\ on the ground that the Walton law, un
der which the election was held, was un
constitutional, and that therefore there
was no valid election. This view was advo
cated by Thomas (R.) of Michigan and an
tagonized by Daniels (D.)of Virginia) and
McCall (R.) of Massachusetts. The dis
cussion was enlivened by a short speech
by Gibson (R.) of Tennessee, who re- I
sented the remark made by JlcCail last
week, in the consideration of the Yost-
Tucket case, that Southern Republicans
hud been "coddled to their destruction,"
and that they needed more robust treat
ment.
Thomas was unable to get an aye and
no vote on tbe question, only 21 second
ing his demand for such a vote and 127
being against it.
INTERNATIONAL BANKING.
Remarks on a Legislative Bill Shew
There Is Not an American Bank
in South America.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.-Repre
sentative Brosius (R.) of Pennsylvania
to-day addressed tbe House Banking Com
mittee on the bill providing for interna
tional banking. He said that the purpose
of tbe measure was to carry into effect the
recommendations of the international con
jerence ol 18S9, by the incorporation of an
international American bank. The resolu
tion of the miernational conference was
in these words:
Resolved, Tnat the conference recommends
to the governments here represented thÂ«
grr.niing of liberal concessions to facilitate
international American banking, and es
pecially such as may be necessary for the es
tablishment of nn international" American
bank, with branches or agencies in the sev
eral countries represented in this conference.
Mr. Brosius in the course of his remarks
said: "The people of the United States, in
common with those ot the Central and
South American republics, feel the neces
sity of increasing commercial intercourse
between the different portions of the
American continent, and they believe the
development of such intercourse has been
retarded by the lack of adequate facilities
for exchange between the several coun
tries, and their hope for a revival in trade
is based in part upon the establishment
of improved banking facilities, which
will emancipate these growing countries
from i heir servitude to the bankers of
London and the continent of Europe. We
do $150,000,000 worth of business with
South America in a year, and yet our bal
ances nave to be settled through English
or European banking-houses. In the
great trade centers of South America, the
English, German, French and Italians
have their banks, and 1 think I am right
in saying there is not an American bank
in all South America. Manifestly this is
a serious hindrance to our trade.
"I am advised by a New York house
which has been doinf business wita South
America for twenty - seven years that
nearly all their transactions were carried
on through credits on London. The reason
is obvious. No matter how good my cus
tomer is in South America, it is not pos
sible for me to negotiate on him at any
reasonable rate of exchange. Our people
nave no means of ascertaining nis stand
in? and credit, and hence a draft on him
must go begging in the United States."
TME PACIFI lIAILROADa.
CongreaMtneu Do >ot Ink* Kindly to the
Commission Scheme.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.âChair
man Powers of the Pacific Railroads Com
mittee of the House said to-night that he
thought his committee would azree upon
a bill to report to the House. He thought
this agreement might be reached by to
morrow, when the committee will hold a
meeting. The Harrison and the Hubbard
bills are the ones before the committee.
Mr. Powers and a majority of the members
of the committee are opposed to the plan
of Representative Hnboard, which pro
vides for a commission of thirteen, each to
receive $10,000 as compensation for ser
vices. This com mis-ion is to have full
power to settle tne indebtedness of all the
Government bond aided railroads.
The commission is specifically instructed
to ascertain whether the lease of the Cen
tral Pacific to the Southern Pacific is a
monopoly, burdensome to the people of
the Pacific Coast, If the commission de
termines that this iv the case it is in
structed to break the lease and prevent its
re-establishment.
Chairman Powers this morning said
that he was aware that the commission
would have no power to deal with the set
tlement ot the case of the Union Pacific,
on which the Government has already or
dered foreclosure, but it would apply to
other Government aided roads. He is de
termined to push whatever bill is reported
by the committee. He docs not know
whether action can be had in the House,
but thinks he can bring this about.
Representative Hubbard is oprosed to
a Cabinet commisMon. and unless he can
get through his bill for what he terms a
non-partisan comanasion he will fight any
new bill reported by the committee. He
does not believe that a bill of any kind can
be put through the House- this session,
and is making no efforts to pusn his own
bill.
Among the men who voted against tha
funding bill there is a sentiment that the
commission will be mereiy an instrument
for further delaying settlement with the
Government by all the roads. Western
members are giving this opinion freely.
This idea will greet the new bill, if it is re
ported, and will probably defeat it.
WANTS A CABINET COMMISSION.
Attorney- Genera/ Harmon's Plan to Sett/9
the Indebtedness of the Pacific
Railroads.
WASHINGTON, D. Q, Feb. 3.âAttor
ney-Generai Harmon appeared before the
House Committee on Pacific railways to
day and expressed at some* length his
views with reference to the bill to settle
the indebtedness of the Pacific railways to
ihe Government by a commission consist
ing of three Cabinet officers. Speaking
generally, he favored the proposition. Ha
would give the committee full authority
to act according to their best judgment,
and would not bind them to the acceptance
of a certain minimum sum, for beyond
that sum they would not be likely to re

of a maximum sum might handicap tnem
because of their failure co receive so large
an amount. He deprecated the sugges
tion of a comnii^sio* of private citizen*,
as the personnel of such a commission
could not be known in advance to Con
gress, or the considerations which had led
to their selection. Moreover, outsiders
would demand pay for their services,
while the members of the Cabinet would
discharge this duty without remuneration,
and merely as an addition to their daily
routine. The country would be better
satisfied with a Cabinet commission.
Moreover, the Cabinet officers were a part
of the Government, and had access
through their subordinates, to all matters
in the possession of the Government.
THIS AX2I-SCALFIAG BILL.
A Law Designed to Force Railroads to
Jiedeem lickets.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.âAmend
ments intended to popularize the anti
scalping bill were agreed to by the Senate
Committee on Interstate Commerce to
day.
As amended, and as the bill will prob
ably be reported to the Senate, the rail
road companies will be required, within
thirty days after the law r.ces into effect,
to redeem all legal tickets offered for re
demption. This is done to protect those
brokers who may have secured iickets by
private arrangements with any railroad
company.
The bill will also be amended so as to re
quire the companies to redeem not only
the unused portion of any ticket in the
hands of the public, but the whole ticket
if it should not be used. It is believed tlie
bill will be_ reported at the next meeting of
the committee.

Mate of an Aynerienn linrk Confined it*
a Cnllao Prison.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.â The
State Department has sustained the
United States Charge d'Affaires in his
protest against the confinement of S. G.
Treanor, mate of the American bark Unc c
John of San Francisco, at Callao, Peru,
and has instructed that official to demand
Treanor's release.
Treanor, who was naturalized at San,
Francisco in 1891, took a drink or two
a*hore on the night of December 16, and
in a subsequent row betwuen twenty
seamen and the police, he resisted arrest.
He got no hearing until December 24,
when, according to a report received at
the State Department, little or no evidence
was developed against him. Confidencn
is expressed that trie man will be released
in compliance with the department's ca
bled demand on January 27.

Regulaiintj Sale of Seized Opium.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.â The
Committee on Ways and Means to-day
agreed to report favorably the bill to
amend the laws regulating the saie of
opium seized for failure to pay the duty
on that article. The luw requires that
such forfeited opium shall not oe sold for
less than the amount of the duty, $10 a
pound. As the market price of opium is
but $t> or $7 a pound, the treasury officials
cannot oi course secure the duty price.
The amendment proposes that the opium
shall be sold to the highest bidder.
Strengthening thn Copyright Late.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 3.â The
House Committee on Patents to-day
ordered favorably reported the bill amend
ing the copyright law so as to prevent the
fraudulent use of the word "copyrighted"
and to strengthen the law in that direc
tion. It gives the courts the remedy of
injunction as well as penalty in such,
cases.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL,
It is a bad year for cinch bills.
Just one month more of Grover.
The rain threatens to be too much of a
good thins.
When prosperity begins to come it Trill
come a-humrning.
Every new appointment to the Cabinet
adds to its strength.
American seamen have rights which
Congress must respect.
A month from to-day we inaugurate the
administration of prosperity.
Willie Hearst, will have to dig up the
stuff in New York. Long Green is non
plused.
Which will be the next corporation to
follow the example of the Southern
Pacilic and expose the blackmailers?
Here lies the body of Ambrose Blerce;
His soul, now gone, was always scarce.
Lie heavily on him, earth, lor he
Kid long and meanly lie on tbee,
It is in vain the Examiner tries to hide
itself from public scorn behind the coats
of honest men. The foxy effluvia betrays
its presence.
The arm of our law is as strong and as
Jong as that of Australia when it comes to
arresting criminals, but there are differ
ences later on.
It is hard to tell from the debates in the
Senate on the Nicaragua canal bill whether
the Senators think they ara holding a
consultation or an inquest.
"The funds of Wasteful Willie I squander not."
Long Green said. "All squandering is rot.
'Tis true I strip him, but no waste Is ahowu;
His purse I empty but to till my own."
Governor Pingree of Michigan insists
upon his right to serve also as Mayor of
Detroit, and for the first time in his life
lias become a questionable official.
The Examiner continues to support
cinch bill legislators, but we notice that
in trying to escape the lash of The Call
it is always careful to dodge behind honest
men.
By compelling the lampooners and
libelers of George K. Fitch to publicly
acknowledge his honesty The Call has
won the praise of every honorable man in
California.
The long-protracted discussion as to
â whether Pennsylvania should have a new
Etate Capitol is no longer a burniDg
isrue. She will either have one or legis
late in ashes.
The Kansas legislator wfyo has intro
duced a bill making it a misdemeanor to
swear has probably just enoueh sense to
know that he is one of the cranks Kansas
is swearing at.
Harvard students are complaining that
the faculty has begun to treat them like
little boys, when, really, the action of the
faculty seems directed to bad boys, with
out regard to size.
The assertion of the Examiner that The
Call is "ringing the fire alarm" is an
other attempt to delude the people. It is
not the firemen but the police that are
wanted for blackmailers.
One of the encouraging signs of the
(situation is the presence of the Republican
State Central Committee at Sacramento.
The members of that body can be counted
on to promote good legislation and right
cinch bills.
The bill now before the Legislature de
claring it unlawful to make a contract in
this State "providing for payment in any
particular or specific kind o! money issued
by the United States" furnishes a very
good piece of paper with which to line a
vastebasket.
"If reputable citizens are to be induced
to take part in the City government they
must be assured of immunity from abuse
when they try to do their duty to the
public." This sneer of the Examiner we
repeat with earnestness. Ask the Park
Commissioners.
The defense made by the Sacramento
Typographical Union No. 46 of the women
employed In the State Printing Office
against the attacks "of a sensational
press evidently inspired from interested
pources" was timely, manly and vigorous.
The working people of California are
rau;dlv learning to understand the
Examiner and to know what its motives
Â»re.
The mass-meeting in this City to pro
mote the passage of the bill securing
better treatment to oar seamen revived
the sentiment of the days when the
American people went to war with Eng
land to protect sailors' rights. If we
were willing to fight to save our own sea
men from imprisonment under a foreign
flag we should at least secure them liberty
under our own.
In republisbing yesterday an editorial
from The Call of May, 1895, commending
"Willie Hearst the Examiner recalled what
was seemingly a great offense on our part.
The offense, however, was not bo bad as
it looks. It must be remembered that
up to that time Hearst had not been ex
posed as a subsidized agent of the South
ern Pacific nor had he given any signs of
turning Long-Green Lawrence loose to
loot the town.
THE REAL ISSUE.
The manacers of tne Examiner ha%'ing been oxposed in their attempt to levy
bJackmaii on the water and the gas companies, as they did at one time on the South
ern Pacific, liave resorted to a bold ruse to escape public indignation. They now assert
that tney attack these and other corporations in the interest of the public and that
their sole object at present is to obtain for the people lower rates for the U3e of water
and gas.
As a means of carrying this ruse to a successful conclusion the Examiner charges
The Call with antagonism to popular interests. It tries to hide its own depravity by
alleging that The Call is as abandoned as itself. It seeks to evade tne real issue by
raising a false one and hopes by vicious attacks upon honesty to deprive The Call of
that public confidence which is necessary to enable it to overcome the banded powers
of blackmail journalists and cinch bill lobbyists.
The readers oi The Call are well aware that it has never opposed a reduction in
the charges for water or for gas; it has simply opposed an attempt to extort money
from corporations by cinch bills and blackmail. The position of Tiie Call is the
same that is taken on this subject by every honest man in Pan Francisco. It is the
duty of the Supervisors to carefully jnd exhaustively examins the accounts of the
water and gas companies and determine what rat- of charges will enable them to earn
a fair and legitimate profit on the investment. That duty every honest Supervisor
will conscientiously endeavor to perform, and he can count upon The Call and all
honest men to support him in doing it.
The real issue between The Call and the managers of the Examiner is not whether
gas and water rates shall be reduced, but whether they shall be reduced in accordance
with law and justice, or whetner a threat of arbitrary and spoliating reduction shall
be held over the corporations in order to force them to pay big money to have the
agitation stopped.
The present controversy is simply a repetition of the contest against the funding
bill. The Call made that fight solely for the purpose of having the public interests
maintained by enforcing the law. The Examiner entered the ficht solely to extort
money from the railroad company. When the subsidy of $1000 a month was paid the
Examiner bad no further fight to make. When the subsidy was cut off the Examiner
immediately began to get up a petition just as it is doing now. Had the Southern
Pacific renewed the subsidy the Examiner' 3 petition against tho funding bill would
have been dropped in the wastebasket. If the water and the gas companies
should put up the price "Long Green" Lawrence demands, the petition he is now
ostensibly getting up would be torn into strips and thrown into the kennel to make
beds for the pups. â¢
The whole issue in the controversy is the simple one of law against blackmail.
The people are concerned in it, because they can never have good government,
either State or municipal, as long as invested capital is compelled to pay bluckmnil
or subsidies of any kind to corrupt officials and horseleech journalists. When such
offenders are permitted to s;o un whipped of public justice large corporations are com
pelled to expend great sums of money to defend themselves against the predatory
rascals, or to buy their silence. This condition of affairs disturbs legitimate enter
prise, imperils capital and corrupts politics.
The evil has grown from bad to wor3e and has now become intolerable. It is
time to crush it out. Every intelligent man in San Francisco knows that under its
present management the Examiner has been exposed and convicted of extorting
subsidies from corporations. Why then should any man permit himself to be de
ceived by its professions of regard for public interests? Why should any man hesi
tate to exclude the paper from his housenold and to refuse to give even an indirect
support to the gang of blackmailers who control it and profit by it?
THE PUBLIC GOOD.
The action of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee in establishing head
quarters at Sacramento, to be maintained
during the continuance of the legislative
session, is decidedly a good innovation in
politico. No men are better titte.l to as
sist in shaping and directing legislation
than the men who represent the Republi
can organization of the State, and who
are charged with the responsibility of
guiding the party in the conduct of pub
lic affairs, so that its prestige with the
people will be increased and its hold upon
public confidence retained.
The headquarters will serve asa general
gathering place for .Republicans of all sec
tions of the State, and in the informal
discussions held there men can learn
what is needed for the State as a whole,
as well as for their own counties, and
what is expected by the people at large as
well as by their local constituencies.
From these discussions much good will
result. The rej^resentatives of the party
in the Legislature will be brought into
harmony with one another and enabled
to act unitedly for the best interests of the
commonwealth.
One of the chief dnties of the committee
will be to defeat the schemes and machi
nations of cinch bill legislators. Some of
the tricks of these men are so cunningly
concealed that a new legislator, unversed
in the intrigues of politics, may readily
be deceived by them, and, with the best
intentions in the world, be deluded into
supporting them.
The members of the State Central Com
mittee form an excellent corps of Buper
vision over legislation generally, and can
be counted on to assist in exposing and
defeating the schemes of nefarious lob
byi-ts, blackmail journalists and what
few allies tiiey may have either in the
Assembly or the Senate.
Major Frank McLaughlin, chairman of
the committee, is to be congratulated
upon the move which has been made
nnder his direction. He won high honors
by the skill and energy with which ho
conducted the Republican party to suc
cess in California during t lie campaign,
and proved himself to be the ideal man
for that position. Not content with serv
ice already rendered, he now goes for
ward to undertake lurther duties to the
party and to the people. "What he has
undertaken is an innovation in politics,
but it will be approved by all who have
the welfare of the State at heart.
The chairman is fortunately supported f
by strong and able members of the com- â 
mittee, and there can be no Question but '
what bis new work will be as successfully
carried out as was the victorious cam
paign of last fall. It is one of the good
signs of the situatifn that Major Me-
Laughlin and his colleagues have had the
public spirit to give their attention to the
legislation which is now proposed, and
the innovation thus begun will no doubt'
prove so satisfactory to the people that it '
will be continued as a permanent part of '
our politics.
THE TEEATY SIGNED
The long dispute over the Venezuelan
boundary and over the right of the United
States to interfere in all controversies of a
similar nature between an American
country and a foreign power lias baen
virtually settled. The treaty of arbitra
tion arranged under the direction of the
Secretary of State of our Government
has been signed by the representatives of
England and Venezuela, and what is left
to be done is a matter of detail, involving
no principle of importance between the
two countries or between them and our
own.
The fortunate issue of this controversy
will constitute one redeeming feature of
the Cleveland administration. It can be
seen now that Mr. Cleveland was fortun
ate in selecting the successor to Secretary
Gresham. If Mr. Olney has not played
his part with tac:, he has certainly done
so with firmness. The results prove the
wisdom of his course. He may be accused
by future mugwumps as he has been by
those now living of being too rude and
too little diplomatic in the famous letter
to Congress on the Venezuelan question,
but t *ir criticisms cannot affect the fact
that he succeeded where milder-mannered
men have failed. It is evident that a little
"jingoism" now and then is by no means
harmful to diplomacy.
The amount of territory involved in the
dispute, while of great value perhaps to
Venezuela, was of no importance to us.
Our interest in the affair has bpen se-
cured by compelling or winning British
recognition of our right to practically ap
ply the principles enunciated in the Mon
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1897.
roe doctrine. What Great Britain has
conceded no other nation is likely to seri
ously dispute. Any question hereafter
between an American .-tate and a Euro
-I'i-an nation involving a claim against the
territory of the American state will be
submitted to our interference as a matter
oi course.
This does not mean war on our part, but
it doe? mean arbitration. It means that
no European state, however powerful,
shall wrongfully despoil an American
country however weak. It means that
the United States is to stand as the de
fender of the independence of American
soil. It is no slight thing to have gained
a recognition of this right on our part,
and the American people will regard Sec
retary Olney as one of those who has
served his country well and illustrated in
an otherwise weak Cabinet the dignity of
American statecraft and the honor of the
American RÂ§public.
AMEBICAN SEAMEN.
The mass-meeting held in this City to
urge the enactment by Congress of a bill
providing better security in the law for
the rights of American seamen gave
utterance to what is undoubtedly the
sentiment of a great majority of the
American people.
It is difficult to see why there should be
any opposition to the proposed bill. It
was passed by the House of Representa
tives after lull discussion, and has thus
received the indorsement of that portion
of Congress which most directly repre
sents the people and is in closest aym
pathy with their aims and desires. The
opposition made to it in the Senate is
Bomewhat extraordinary, and the people
have acted rightly in urging its passage
and expressing indignation against those
who obstruct it.
The American people in years past en
tered upon a war with Great Britain to
maintain the rights of American sailors.
At that time our fathers wera willing to
right in order to secure our seamen from
impressment under a foreign flag. We
would be unworthy of sucu sires if we
were not willing now to secure our sailors
by law of nghtiul liberty and a just pro
tection under our own Hag.
The United States of right should be the
greatest maritime power on tbe globe.
Our commerce, if not our navy, should ex
ceed that of any other country. Our ships
should be in every sea aim the men who
man them and defend the flag that floats
over them should be Americans. It is In
vain, however, that we hope to gather the
youth of our seacoast States into our com
mercial marine if we subject them as sail
ors to a condition whicti ia so near abso
lute servitude as to almost merit the name
of slavery.
There is no reason why the Americaan
seaman should not enjoy the same rights
and privileges as the American worker on
land. It is something of a National dis
grace that he does not already enjoy them,
and it is the duty of Congress to right his
wrongs as speedily as possible.
The bill whose passage the seamen ad
vocate is not revolutionary in its nature,
nor evan radical. It hardly goes further
than to extend to seamen engaged in for
eign commerce the same rights which
have been already given to those engaged
In the coasting trade. It aims to put an
end to certain practices which are well
recognized as evils. It is thoroughly
Amencun in meaning and intent and is
designed solely to guarantee to Americans
who work on the deep seas the same per
sonal rights which are enjoyed by Ameri
cans at home. Thepa% B ageof the bill will
have a tendency to encourage youne men
along our seacoasts to enter our commer
cial service, sad will be a benefit to the
ship-owners as well as to the seamen.

Letters From the People.
THE "BUG BIBLE."
Many Copies of It Said to Be in Â£*lst-
ence in. This Country.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
I have seen in the papers repealed accounts
of the 'Bug tfib'.e" and its rarity. The writers
o! these paragraphs teem to have but an in
sufficient knowledge of their subject. There
are probably scores of "Buz Bibles" in the
United States. I myself brought one to this
country more than twenty years ago (I used
to have several), which I gave to a friend, and
which I suppose is still in existence some
where. I believe it will be found that ail the
bibles printed by Barker, whether in black
letter or in plain Roman, contain this syno
nym for the word "terror," and it is also found
in other versions. The word occurs often In
seventeenth century literature, a well-known
example being in Shakespeare's "Hamlet,"
and remains in use in our words "bogey" and
â¢â¢bugbear,' and 'bug, M Bs applied by Ameri
cans to any unpleasant animal of the worm
grub or insect kind. It is more difficult to
understand how the English came to confine
it entirely to insects of the family of cimieidjp
the members of which are always ill-smelling
but often gayly colored, and in" other lespects
less offensive than most of the insect tribe.

The Year 1900â E. A. S., Alameda. CaL The
best authorities do not agree with you in re
gard to the year 1899 closing the nineteenth
century. In the Century Dictionary is the
following:
The first century of the Christian era began with
the year A. D. land extended to the end of the year
100: the third century began with the rear 201 and
ended with the year 300, and the eighteenth cen
tury began with 1800, the year completing the 100
year pÂ»rlod In each Instance Giving name to the
the century, l&t&a
Thus the nineteenth century began with
1801 and will close with 1900, and the year
1901 will be the beginning of the twentieth
century and not the nineteenth century as
announced in thii department through an
error ol transcription a lew days since.
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Messrs. Friedlander, Gottlob & C.\ announce
that they have almost completed arrange
ments for the appearance of Bror.islaw Hub.r
man at the California Theater. The child
prodigy has been very much overdone of late
years, but this boy violinist seems to be the
most remarkable child wonder since the
appearance years ago of little Joseph
Hoffman. Before Huberman came to this
country he was announced as "Not a prodigy
but an artist," and his concerts have proved
that the statement was no exaggeration. He
came to New York with very little prelim
inary puffing, and made his American debut
at Carnegie Hall on November 19 with tne
Seidl Orcnestra. Since then the boy has been
the sensation of the concert season, '96 and '!)7,
both in New York and Boston. Ail tho vio
linists Â«nd pianists who have come this
season in search of American dollars, and
have been photographed and paragraphed
and had weird stories told of their doings to
excite public curiosity, have not risen to tho
top crest of popularity, as little Huberman
has done. The boy is described as possessing
BRONISLAW HUBERMAN, the Child Wonder Violinist, Who
Will Probably Be Heard at the California Theater.
precocious mind in every
way. To converse with him is to converse with
a full-fledged adult of remarkable mentality,
ana then to glance at his young face, framed
in its mass of black curls, is almost a shock.
A few years ago the poetess queen, Carmen
Silva, painted Huberman's portrait as an
angel. Those who have seen him recently
say that there are flashes of demoniacal
power and passion in the boy's expression
now that would ill become an angel. After
his American tour, which will end in May,
Huberman pere will send his son to school in
Vienna in order that he may enjoy the com
panionship of children of his own age, a
thing he has hitherto never done.
Miss Sibyl Sanderson is going down to pos
terity in a unique and interesting way as the
personification of one of the three most suc
cessful French operas of modern times. The
city of Paris is building itself a magnificent
new Opera Comique (or Salle Favart, as it is
often called, after the founder of the Prench
opera comique). The edifice is nownearing
completion, and the frescoing of tue great dome
has been intrusted to the celebratad painter,
Benjamin Constant A representative of Le
Matin interviewed the painter the other day re
specting his work, and this is what he said :
"The base of the design will consist of the
three most celebrated operas comiques of the
French contemporary school. In the center
will be Mignon, Goethe's heroine, who has be
come that of Ambroise Thomas; she will be
standing uprlgnt, with Lothario at her feet
and Wilhelm Meister at her right. To the
spectator's right will be seen the three chief
characters in Bizet's 'Carmen,' and to the left
will be Maisenet's Manon, alighting frqm her
sedan chair while the Chevalier dcs Urleux
gallantly kisses her hand."
'â¢Shall you give your figures the traits of the
artists who have created or given the best in
terpretation of the leading roles? 1 ' asked the
representative of Le Matin aud Constant re
plied:
"Assuredly. Thus you will see Miss Sibyl
Sanderson as Manon, for I consider that the
revival of Massenet's opera by that artist can
be looked upon as a very remarkable one.
Carmen will be Emma Calve, who ha* tri
umphed most in the role, and Mignon will be
Ualli-Marle, who created the part, and vho
has never been approached in it.
When one considers that the Salle Favart is
a national building and that the artistic deco
rations of such buildings have an almost sacred
significance in France, it is quite a remarkable
fact that a singer from far-away California
Rhou'd be placed there with two of the greatest
French artists of modern times.
Melba has gone back to Europe an invalid,
but it is halt believed that she will return
before the end of the grand opera season.
There are various reasons assigned for her in
disposition. New York papers have been air
ing the statement that she caught cold at the
draughty Academy of Music while lying in her
tomb in "Romeo and Juliet." Melba's failure
in the role of Brunhilde is also given as a
reason for her temporary withdrawal, as Jeau
ac Reszke persuaded her to aing the part,
assuring her that she could do as well as or
better than Nordica. De Keszke is now accused
of having done this in order to reap all the
glory lor the part of Siegfried instead of
sharing the applause with Nordica's Brun
hilde. If this is true, Melba must feel that she
has been made a tool of. A newspaper corre
spondent has calculated that on the evenings
when Melba appears in opera in New York,
she is paid at the rate of $70 a minute. 'At
that calculation at & recent performance she
received over $1 a second. But meanwhile,
the tenor had something to do, and by exact
computation Melba sang only ten minutes, so
she earned $150 for each minute ot actual
work. Continuing this investigation further,
we find that every lime the diva exhaled her
breath she made $50. Yet she began her
musical career at Penny Readings in Australia
for a compensation of 62 cents, or two and six
ponce a night. No romance by Stanley Wey
man or Anthony Hope can equal the astonish
ment of grand opera."
A colossal fiasco has marked the opening
of the Ecala season at Milan with "The
Duekof the Gods." A Milanese newspaper,
speaking of Wagner and hit music in Italy,
says: "How many of us are believers? Tha
coming performances will no doubt toll us.
Of the nay, glittering, multi-colored crowd
which filled the theater and listened very at
tentlve:y on the first night, certainly nine
tenthi were abominably bored, and snowed
once again by their silence to what extent
Wagner Is accepted in Milan. 'The Dusk of
the Gods' may ba a masterpiece, and may pre
sent a veritable intellectual delieht for those
who are versed in the music of the German
master, and wnoare seekers after philosophy
For the moment though the music seemed
very wearisome to our public, ana the man
agers had better not abuse its patience, if they
do not want to see a repetition of the memor
able exceas which marked the performances
of 'The Valkyrie* a few years ago."
Mile. Antoinette Trebelli has had some rather
unique exceriences during her world's tour
On one occasion she visited the Interior of Zu
luland, and the Zulus hearing of her fame
came in thousands to see if she would sing for
them, as they had never heard a white singer.
She was viaitujg the wile oX me commander ol
the British garrison, ana at her request agreed
to give the Zulus an open-air concert. Tho
warriors came in thousands to the appointed \
spot outside the fort, and squatting on the!
ground, with their black faces upturned, ex- '
pressed their approbation of Mile. Trebelli's
singing by deep guttural grunts. On another
occasion the young vocalist sang "Home,
Sweet Home" to a thousand Cornish miners
in Australia six hundred feet below the sur
laco of the earth.

One of tho artists who will come to America
this year is Sims Reeves, the veteran English
tenor. Reeves won renown in Italian opera a
generation or more ago, and has made and
lost a fortune since then. About two ycirs
ago he took a second wife in the person of a
young pupil of his, who had been named
Maud in her infancy by her parents on ac
count of their admiration for the way in
which Sims Reeves saDg the ballad "Come
Into the Garden, Maud." Reeves will make

"They dragged ray baby from my arms,
and now they are going to take her away
so far that I'll never see her again,"
sobbed Mrs, Lucinda Holstrom in Judge
Troutt's court yesterday when the Judge
declared that he had np power to help the
grief-stricken woman who stood before
him.
It was one of those scenes so common in
the courts of the land, when a tender
hearted magistrate does not see his way
clear to extend the assistnnce he would
like to give, and when even if he did so
his act would entail sorrow on others, for
there are always two sides to a case like
this.
Mrs. Holstrom had suod out a writ of
habeas corpus for the recovery of a sweet
littis baby girl who is now something
more than 4 years oid.

Holstrom, to hei foster mother.
Airs. Holstrom in presenting her peti
tion for the writ alleged : "That said child,
who is now a little over 4 years of age, was
given to your petitioner in said City and
County when it was only six days old "by the
mother, who was an unmarried woman,
I and your petitioner for more than
i four years lasi past has nur
tured, maintained and carei for
said child; and said child iias never known
any other mother than >our petitioner;
that on the Ist day of February, 1897. Frank
j J. Kane, under the fraudulent and fa!>e
i pretense that your petitioner was not a fit
and prorer person to have the custody of
said child, forcibly and without richt and
without cause seized and carried away said
child from the custody of your petitioner
to the great detriment and injury of said
child."
In Mr. Kane's reply he said he was not
! able to comply witn any order of Judpe
j Troutt to produce the body of the chiid in
i court for the reason mat ne gave the lit
â  tie one to its mother on the Ist of Febrn
j ary at the corner of Seventeenth and
Howard streets, before Mrs. Holstrom be
gan her habeas corpus proceedings.
Attorney Daley wanted to have the
writ dismissed at once, but the court
I allowed Attorney Leonard S. ClarK to
I cross-examine Mr. Kane. The officer tes
i titled that he gave the little girl to her

I Howard utreet* last Monday. He doesn't
know the mother's present name, doesn't
know where she lives, does't Know where
the child is now, and could not find her.
The child's mother is now married and
wants her child.
"So you put this child into the custody

of a person unknown to you?' demanaed
Mr. Clark.
"Yes."
"Is that your way of doing business for
the Society of Prevention of Cruelty to
children?" again sneered Mr. Clark.
Mr. Kane objected to the question, and
he was sustained by the court. He did
not like to tell what the name o: the
child's mother was before lier marriage.
He did not know that she was ever photo
graphed at a Mission gallery in a nude
condition.
"All these niattors will come up before
Jud<:e Coffcy in the application for guar
dianship, I suppose, and it is therefore
not necessary to go into them here," said
Judge Troutt, ami the writ was dismissed.
That was why Mrs. Hol^troru was weep
ing as if her heart would break, and why
between her sobs she vowed that she
would never give up the struggle to regain
possession of the little oue who was torn
so ruthlessly from her arms.
Ii Mrs. Holstrom'e story is true, and it
is supported by the testimony of half â 
dozen witnesses, Mr. Kane does not ap
pear in a very enviable light, so far as this
occurrence is concerned.
ThÂ« grief-stricken woman said: "Mr.
Kane came in and said be wanted to see
me, and when he got sight of the child, he
grabbed her by the back of her clothes in
a rude and furious manner. He was as
fierce as a tiger, and the baby was almost

scared to death. She clung to me and
screamed with lright tili she was black in
the face. On my Knees 1 bogged permis-
I lion to kiss my baby good-byâ tny little
I baby that I had taken to my heart when
, its own rnotner cast it offâ and he refused
Ime even that. He yelled for mo to stand
, back, "For you are not its mother,' he
said. But lam \\a molner in love, and
the little one knows it, for she clung to me
with bo.h hands, and he lmi to pound
her liitle amis wich his great lists belore
j he could make her let go. Oh, it was
dreadful, but he showed me his tiricer's
I star, and threatened to call tne patrol
wagon and "bundle us all to the jus,' as
he expressed it, if we didn't quit talking to
i him.
"It wa? only about 8 o'clock in tne
morning, and my little one was not
dressed to go out, but this man wouldn't
even let me put on her cloak or her bood.
He teemed awfully anxious to get nold of
the child. My fat: c.- was there and I
asked him to go with them, for Kane
brought the baby's mother to the door.
When thÂ° little one saw my father it was
comforted somewhat, but it held out its
hands to me an 1 wanted me to take it.
"I was so dazed an I so intimidated that
I didn't know what to do. 1 ought to nave
tracked them to see what they did with
my darling, but I let them pet away, and
now we may never meet again."
The lady's friends gathered uround her
and attempted to comfort her, but she
seemed inconsolable, for she Oelieves the
child will be spirited out oi San Francisco
and beyond the jurisdiction of the Probate
Court. Mrs. Holstrom haa the appear
ance of being a good, respectable woman
and the testimony of her friends is that 1
she leads a blameless Ufa.
William A. Lightfoot, a fine-looking old
gentleman, whose eye- were tear-stained,
corroborated the lady's statement. "This
is ray daughter," he said, placing his
hand affectionately on Mrs. Ilolstrom's
shoulder. "She lives with me and my
wife at 4761Â£ Eighth street, where Kane
found the baoy. She is a good woman,
industrious, gentle and everything that a
mother should be. She is periectly de
voted to her little baby, and you ought to
see the big supply of baby clothes that she
lias made with her own hands for our
Eva. We all love the little thing as much
as if she were our very own, as in feet she
seems to be, and I say it is an outrage lor
Kane to drag her from her home in that
brutal manner.' 1
"Yes, aittr all these years," said Mrs.
Ho. strom, "it seems strange that tne
mother should so suddenly want her
back. AVhen I took her I told her that
she might see the baby whenever she
wanted to, but .-he renlied that she never
wanted to see it or hear of it ngnin."
Attorney Clark is not satisfied with
Judjje Troutt's decision and will take out
another petition for habeas corpus, prob
ably before Judee Carroll Cook. He thinks
that asOmcirKane took the chila from
its home that he'is the proper person to
produce it In court. He will cite some de
cisions of the higher courts to sustain this
position. If any cflicer could shirk re
sponsibility in thit way, Mr. Clark says,
the purpose of the writ of habeas corpus
could ba defeated by any person who was
venturesome enougn to commit acts like
that of Otlicer Kane.
Mrs. Holstroin's petition for guardian
ship and adoption will, be called for hear
ing in Judge Coffey's court 011 the 9th
mat. In addition to otuer matters she
will ask the court to enter a judgment of
abandonment as against the mother
of the child. In some cases it ha
been held that a year's neglect has been
sufficient to establish legal abandonment.
Mrs. Holstroni exhibited a photograph
of the chiid Eva. The picture was taken
about a year ago, and shows as pretty a
baby as one would wish to see. There is
no wonder that two mothers desire the
ustody of such a chilj.

No More Prize Packages.
The Treasury Department has issued an
order relative to a practice prevalent among
foreign shippers of tea intended for this coun
try, of placing dutiable goods in the same
packages with tea. These articles consist of
chinaware, transparencies, etc., and are
intended as gifts to the retail purchasers.
This practice the department holds to be un
lawful under the tariff laws, inasmuch as it
prevents an examination of the goods and fa
cilitates frauds upon the revenue. The in-
ructions are to take possession of packages
of tea containing merchandise and notify me
persons concerned that no such packages wilt
be admitted to entry except for immediate
exportation.

HER DEATH ACCIDENTAL.
The Police Believe Mrs. Hal!
Took an Overdose .of
Poison.
H r HtnbaDd, Who Was Arrested
Pi- I. ding an Investigate n, Was
Discharged.
The police made an inveatieation Into
the death of Mrs. Robert Hill Tuesday
with the result that her husband was,
by order of Captain Lees, discharged from
custoJy.
Mr*. Hall had been t ubject to periodical
spells of intense puin, and foi her relief
Dr. J. \V. Frost prescribed about a year
ago morphine and ntrophine tablet*.
Her husband is employed as a teamster
for the Morton Delivery Company, and
Monday morning he and his wife had
breakfast together at their home on Dia
mond and Surrey streets, near Bunnyside,
and then he left for his work.
Mrs. Hall came into the City and called
upon her sister-in-law, agreeing to see
her again yesterday afternoon. About 7
o'clock Monday niulit she went into a
butcher-shop on Thirtieth street, near San
Jose avenue, and bought some meat.
6he asked for a glass of water, and it is
supposed she put scmo of the tablets in
the water, probably too many.
Tliree hours later she was discovered in
a doorway nenr the butcher-shop in an
unconscious condition and was tnken to the
Seventeenth-street station in the patrol
wagon. Captain Litten sent her to the
Receiving Hospital and when her pockets
were searched a vial, which had contained
tho tablets was found tnd a prescription
from Dr. Frost dated February 2, 189&
A memorandum book was aho found in
her pocket which contained her address.
Dr. l*i izjjibbon came to the conclusion
that the woman was suffering from mor
i nine and atropbine j o:son and that sLa
won't! die.
Captain Giilen was notified about the
prescription and address and He sent an
officer to Dr. Frost, Â«rho at once suspected
the woman was Mr?. Hall. The enptain
also sent to Diamond and Surrey streets
and Hall was foun 1 asleep in bed. He
hurried to tlie hospital, arriving thore
shortly before 1 o'clock yesterday morn
ing. He at once identified his wilt, and
her father E N. Bush, 417 Hayes street,
was sent lor. Hall Also sent a back for
Dr. Frost.
Dr. fltzgibbon interrogated Hall and.
notified Captain Gilien that he had made
contradictory statements, and that the
case was mysterious. The captain thought
it advisable to hold Hail pending an in-
vestigation, and be telephoned Lieutenant
BirdsalJ to place Hail under arrest. Po
iiceman McShune came to the hospital,
arrested Hail, put the handcuffs on him
and took him to the Central Police Sta
tion. Lieutenant BirdÂ«a!l ordered the
handcuffs taken off Hall's wrists, and,
after communicating with Captain Gilleu,
Hall was sent b.ick to the Receiving Hos
pital in charge of Policeman Coogan, so
that he could be at the bedside of his dy
ing wife. After her death he was locked
up in the tanks.
Hull said he knew his wife was taking
something to relieve her pain, but he did
not know whether she took 'ablets or not.
They had been married for seven years.
His wife became addicted to drink to re
lieve her pain, and finally she had to take
medical advice.
When he got home Monday nisht after
his day's work hit wife wad not there, and
thinking she might have pone dovntown
and would not return till late, as she had
often done before, he cooked his supper,
ate it nnd went to bed. There was nothing
to lead her to commit suicide.
Detective Reynolds was detailed on the
case, and Captain Gilien detailed Corporal
Shanahan also to make an investigation.
After hearing Shanaiian's report Captain
Gilien advised that Uall should be dir
charged, and as noon as Captain Lees, who
was engaged in the Cooney case, was noti
tied of the circumstances he at once signed
an order for Hall's release.
Mrs. Hall's body was taken to the
Morgue and her stomach will be subjected
to a chemical analysis, after which an in
quest will be held.
JUDGE WALLACE SCORED.
Attorney Dunne Presents the Case of
Creegau anil Becker Before the
Supreme Court.
Attorney Josepn Dunne made an elab
orate argument before the Supreme Court
yesterday on the appeal of James Creegan
and Charles Becker, the Nevada Bank
forgers, who were sentenced to life im
prisonment by Judge Wallace.
The law and facts of the case were dis
enssed at length, and many alleged error 3
of Judge Wallace were held up to view.
Judge Wallace was characterized as rul
ing against the defendants at every oppor
tunity, thus preventing them from intro
ducing considerable evidence in their
favor. Accomplice Dean was represented
as a man of inveracity, and his evidence
as a consequence worth nothing at all.
Furthermore Dunne was of the belief that
it had been presented only to please the
police.
Numerous points of law were presented
in conclusion, when a new trial of the
men convicted as forcers was asked.
The arguments of Attorney Dunne were
replied to by a representative of the Attor
ney-General. The prosecution believes
j the appeal will not be needed for three or
! four months.
Meanwhile Creegan and Becker grow fat
in the County Jail from inactivity and
good living, while Dean lives well at tne
City Prison. Tue latter hopes that when
! the cases of his associates are finally dis
i posed of he himself will be permitted to
! breathe the air of freedom.

GONE TO JOIN
HIS FATHERS
The Marquis de Beauharnais
Dies Destitute and
Alone.
H? Failed to Profit on a Good
Invention by His Im
postures.
Remarkable Career of Him Who
Claimed Relationship With
Empress Josephine.
Eugene de Beauharnais, "Marquis" and
adventurer, is no more. Death Has ended
a career marked with genius but marred
by imposture.
De Beauharnais' real name wag A. P.
Chamberlain, and he was an ex-Confed
erate soldier, but for years past the
i man's escapades and peculiar claims have
made him an object of discussion on two
continents.
Little ia known about his life's history
other than that he was a Southerner and
77 years of age. During the war he served
as a blockade runner and claimed to have
I a general's commission.
When the war ended he hied himself to
I Europe, where he lived principally by the
exercise of shrewd wits. Here and about
this time it was that he pounced into the
title of Marquis and held with it tena
ciously even till his soul crossed the Sty
cian river into the boundaries of another
worid.
His father, he said, was cousin to the
first husband of the Empress Josephine,
and he also claimed possessions of that
family in dispute in Louisiana.
This claim was a fertile source of In
come to Dim, as he used it in all ilia busi
ness dealings. He found many persons
incautious enough to listen to his smooth
tongue, and as a result they were kept
cnasing the ignis famus of tteir hopes.
When Cnamberiain lir^t arrived in this
City, in 1895, he was accompanied by John
If. Beatty and his son, Herbert Beatty.
1 The trio stayed at the Palace Hotel and re
, ceivcd daily columns in the local press.
When it was discovered that in reality
| the self-styled Marquis was an itinerant
! peddler of a process for utilizing crude
I petroleum in developing power, however,
he was given a wide berth.
The tide of his fortunes gradually fell
to low-water mark. Either the climate j
suited him or he was never able to secure
, enough coin to leave San Franchco, for
i here he remained until" the day of his
i death. He was put out of lodgings on
McAllister street for failure to pay his
; bills and his trunk held as security.
t?inca that time he has lived at the Alex
andria, on Sutter street, the proprietor of
which was not only too kind-hearted to
' turn him out upon the streets, but even
advanced $35 to redeem his trunk.
Last autumn ho wÂ»-nt to Oakland and
I was wooed by Mrs. Virginia Conrad t. a
I demented woman who thought he was
| iroing to marry her, and when he failed to !
! put in an appearance at the hour she iin- I
agined the ceremony was to take place, !
! Mrs. Conradt's dementia assumed so vio- ]
lent a form that it was found necessary to
incarcerate her in the Stockton Insane
| Asylum.
The "Marqii'Y " invention for the utili
zation of petroleum as a development of
power is pronounced excellent by experts,
but he n?ver tried to matte it pay ss he
! should. Evidences of his own insanity
are shown in the fact that he insisted that
mew to-pat:
You can get good tea
from your grocer, and he
will return your money in
full if you don't like it.

Hamilton Smith's Sudden Return to
Londonâ -Buying of th: Siiv.r Bow
Basin and Tomboy Mines.
Eugene Hoefer of South Africa, the con
fidential lieutennnt of Hamilton Smith in
many mining affairs and manager of great
properties on the LU.k Continent, is at the
Palace, accompanied by Mrs. Hoefer. Mr.
Hoefer is a Califoniian by long residence
and education. He came here in early
boyhood, attended the Washington Gram
mar .School and the Boys' High School,
linally graduating at Berkeley. In IS-<8 he
left here for South Africa and hasnoi been
l>hck till now. During his absence he has
acquired a comfortable fortune.
liv is absent from South Africa on a
six months' leave of absence, and will
probably be in California two or three
months, He haa not come on mining
business, but if there should be any reason
way lie should visit any mine or district
here he will do so. Mr. Iloefer is general
manager of the Transvaal CioJJ Mining
Estates, tho Giynns Lyenburg Limited
and other companies in me Pilgrims Rest
district, 260 miles eaut of Johannesburg.
'J his property is owned by Wehner, Beit
& Co. of London. Mr. Jseii is3aid to be
the wealthiest of all the men who have
made intestmenU in Houth Africa.
Mr. Iloefer when he left here went first
to Johannesburg and then to Damaraland,
where he was connected with some iiu
purwint copper properties. Then he went
to Johannesburg and finally went on an
extended trip of exploration through
Matab.leland. He accompanied John
Hays Hammond on i>art of bia trip
when he Â«et out for Buluwayo. Altogether,
he has ha>i many interesting experiences.
"The excitement over South African
mining share- in London and Paris has
died down a good deal." said Mr. Hoefer.
"They were too high, of course; but
when 1 was in Paris 1 took occasion to
assure some of the stockholders there that
bo i'ar as the investments in I'ilgrims
ll'-s; properties were concerned they were
all right. I told them that they would
come out all right on them, and they will.
"The main reason why 1 have been en
abled to i>et away to California at this
time is because of a disease among the
caale wheie I am engaged in mining.
Pilgrims Kest is about sixty miles from
tne railroad, and we have to use bullocks
to haul the freight. As the Cattle in trav
eling spread the disease it was deemed
best to put a sort of quarantine on them.
Am we coul'i get no ireight through, and
therefore could not do much, we con
cluded to close down for a little while.
"While the interest among London min
ing investors has not changed toward
Boath Africa and Australia it has greatly
increased as regards California. A few
years aso, when I first went over there,
almost no attention was paid the Califor
nia mines, but now it is very different.
The gold mines htfe stand well in Eng
land, and much caoital will be invested
hern I have no doubt.
"Thomas Mem is the resident represent
ative here of the powenul British invest
ors headed by the Rothsctiilds. These
people have late y bougnt two mining
properties here. One is the Silver Bow
Basin property in Alaska, and the other
is the Tomboy in Colorado. 1 have no
doubt they will buy other properties
whenever they are convinced they are
getting eood ones.
"Hamilton Smith, who has been in the
United States for some time â mainly in
the Eastâ sailed from New York for Lon
don on January 20. I had expected to
come over here in the same boat with
him, and we exchanged .some dispatches
regarding it, but I could not get reÂ»dy in
time. Ido not know whether he expects
to return and come to the Pacific Coast or
not. Mr. Mem, however, has charge of
everything here."
Mr. Hoefer looks on California as a
great held lor investment. He has mar
ried during his absence, nis wife bein,r an
English lady, and she is here for the first
time. Mr. Hoefer says the improvement
in San Francisco, especially as regards
the erection of treat buildings, is very
marked. He says, 100, that goods are
sola here very cheaply, much cheaper
tnan he expected, and some even cheaper
than in Europe.
Mr. Hoefer's relatives reside here and
he will spend some time in visiting them,
and he will before bis return visit different
parts of the Slate.
Wehner, Beit & Co., who own the mines
of which Mr. Hoeier has the general man
agtment, are part purchasers of the Silver
Bow Basin and Tomboy mines. Mr.
rioefer. though in South Atrica during
tiie famous Jameson raid and all that led
up to it, kept clear ot it all. He met John
Hays Hammond frequently in London,
but does not know wheu he may come to
this country.

DR. COYLE DEFENDS THE REVIVAL.
The Eloquent Pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Oakland
Likens the President of Stanford University to a
Chameleon*
Dear Sir : In your address at Berkeley last Sunday morn ing you are reported to nave said: "Stimulant* produce tem
porary insanity; whisky, cocaine and alcohol brin^ temporary insanity, and bo does a revival of religionâ one of those revivals in
Â«h:ch men 10.-c all their reason and self-control. This is simply a form of drunkenness no more worthy of respect than the I
drunkenness which lies in putters." That, I submit, is very remarkable language wnen the man making it and his subject are j
considered. It would be difficult to imagine anything more full of prejudice and misrepresentation, not to say ignorance. "The I
sober mind" is well balanced; free from heat and extravagance in utterance, fair
and honest and impartial in its judg mentsâ qualities wholly wanting in your
contemptuous flmg at revivals. It is of a piece with the superficial and disdainful
remark you made two or three ye tr* ago in the course of your address before the
State Teachers' Association in thiÂ« City. In that address you declared, in substance,
that religion i 3 only the debris of the dreams of our grandmothers.
When the time and place and occa sion of your latest deliverance as touching
revivals are taken into accourt the ut most charity finds it hard not to conclude
that it was made with malice aforethought. Does it belong to the "sober mind" to
pour contempt upon the feelings and scoff at the wort and ihe cherished beliefs of a
very Jnrsre number of excellent people? Or does it argue the possession of that finely
["i,- (1 judgment and calm kindliness of spirit which characterize treat souls to in
duige in a learn- d sneer in the presence of young men and women from Christian
homes â young men and women to who>e parents that religion wi.ich believes in re
vivals is still most precious? To these, air. and tens of thousands ot evangelical
Christians in California and elsewhere your words are an insult, without pallia
tion or excuse. I have been in a good many revivals, and I have yet to see one
in which "men lose all their reason and seif-control." But I have known some
â cofbng criiics to employ language in condemnation of them which did not con
tain the remotest sugeestion of "the sober mind."
If tliere were nny undue excitement 'or any loss of reason and self-control in re
ligious matters in this section of tbe coun try your wholesale sneer might have some
point. Bal when the moot marked thing about religion in thia entire region is its
deadness, when rev.vals on tins coast are so few and far between and so much
needed, we can only conclude that you went to Berkeley last Sunday mornine pre
pared to attack just such a religious move ment as the one now in progress in Oak
land and to cast a slur upon ah revivals and all revival effort in which evangelical
Christians engage. Their religious earnestness in trying to arrest men In their sins by unusual methods, to reclaim the wander
ing, to woo the drunkard from his cups and turn the straying about with their faces toward God you characterize as "a form of
drunkenness no more worthy of respect than the drunkenness which lies in gutteis." Words more untrue, more unmanly, more
un?cien:ific, more lmmoderataand more unbecoming the president of a university it would indeed be difficult to conceive.
Bat, learned sir, permit me to remind you tbat your deliverance on revivals is not only void of truth, but lacking even in
the merit of originality. On a certain memorable occasion long ago, when Christianity was about to launch away on its world
conquering career; when, after ten days of praying and waiting in the upper room, Pentecobt came with Its baptism of fire, and
the disciples "spake in other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance," there were scoffer* present, self-righteous men, Scribes
aud Pharisees, proud, no doubt, of their superior culture and attainments, intellectually puffed up, who mockingly said, "These
men are full of new wine." You see, therefore, how history repeats itself and tbe lineage in which yon stand. Your scornful
strictures upon revivals agree exactly with what those ancient mockers felt and thought as they bebe.d that wonderful Pentecostal
awakening. They said in effect, "This is simply a form of drunkenness, no more worthy of respect than the drunkenness which
lies in gutters." How much came out of their mockery to bless mankind you are intelligent enough to know. They went away
into oblivion, as the mocker always does sooner or later, but that which in the exercise of "the sober mind" they called drunken
ness went on growing in power and beneficence and i* to-day immeasurably the most uplifting force among men.
Yon, sir, are a scientific man, thoroughly wedded to thÂ» scientific method; and hence I may be allowed to inquire whether
in your scientific judgment it is a mark of "the sober mind" to attribute great effects to unworthy causes. Christianity is no
small thing. Kven by university presidents and learned men in general it is acknowledged to be the grandest movement of the
ages. It is doing infinitely more than anything else at this hour to lift and save and purify mankind. Wherever this stream
finds its way it makes the desert and solitary place rejoice; new fields of love are fertilized by iti life-giving waters; new motives
and inspirations take possession of human breasts; new enterprises are inaugurated for the welfare and happiness of the race.
This is not rhetoric but fact. And yet with your sober and scientific mind you ask us to believe that this movement had its
origin in "a lorm of drunkenness no more worthy of respect than the drunkenness which lios in gutters." Dr. Philip Scbaff,
whose learning and sober-mindedness you will hardly question, calls Pentecost "the birthday of the Christian church." Now if
this is historically correct and Pacifir Coast Christians are to accept the ipse dixit of Piesident Jordan it follows that the Chris
tian church is the is -tie of a sort of temporary insanity, a species of drunkenness "no more worthy of respect than the drunken
ness which lies in gutters."
It is a good deal the fashion for men of your way of thinkineâ self-styled sober-minded menâ to explain the conversion
of Paul as being a kind of mental distemper and the resurreciion of Jesus as having no other basis than that of hallucination,
and to account for the most tremendous effects by pointing to utterly trifling and inadequate causes. How far this accords
with a candid and faithful application of the scientific method I leave you to soberly judge.
The merest tyro in history knows that the Protestant Reformation was more than anything else a series of revivals, many
of them much more exciting. I venture to say, than any you have ever witnessed; and yet out of that drunkenness, "uo more
worthy of respect than the drunken.iess which lies in gutters," see what has come. Methodism, with its church-s on every
shore, with i's institutions of learning, with its schools and colleges and literature, with its myriads of benevolent agencies came
out of the revivals of the Wesleys and Whitfields something over a century ago. A more sober mind than John Wesley, a man
of finer balance of judgment, of greater learning and imperial strength of character, I may safely challenge you to indicate. From
your point of view, however, this celebrated Oxonian, tnis man of splendid power, was temporarily insane when, under God,
he produced those revivals which shook Great Britain and rolled their waves of religious enthusiasm over seas and continents.
And the great Methodist denomination has continued the drunkenness which its immortal founder communicated to itâ "a
drunkenness no more worthy of respect than the drunkenness which lies in gutters."
It is commonly supposed that Jonathan Edwards was a man of some learning. Indeed it is no disparagement of any pro
fessor in any university on the Pacific Coast to say that in intellectual strength, in penetration of thought, In logical acumen, he
has still a few rounds in the ladder to climb ere he reaches tin; level of Jonathan Edwards. Of all the great presidents of
Princeton College and University he stands at the head, and yet Jonathan Edwards was a revivaiiat. He sometimes got drunk
on religion with "a drunkenness no more worthy of respect than that which lies in gutters." Indeed, sir, the great foreign mis
sionary movement of this age, which has sent its pioneers to every land and made i: possible for men lika yourself to study seals
in Alaska and fishes in the islands of the sea. and has done so much to enrich the sciences of geography and ethnology and phi
lology and prepared the way for commerce, is the child of revivals. It was born in a great religious awakening and by great re
ligious awakenings its heroisms and sacrifices have been inspired and its wonderful victories achieved.
In still further elucidation of the "sober mind" you sneered at conversion and, if correctly reported, affirmed that "it is an
absolute impossibility to undergo the transition from a wicked to an upright life in five minutes." Now, sir, lam bound to say
that a sobsr, well-informed mind would neyer have made such a rash and intemperate statement. No evangelical church, no
evangelical Christian, teaches such a doctrine. Conversion on the human side is an act of will, a decision, a choice, and'is it
according to "the sober mind" an "absolute impossibility" for a man to make a decision in five minutes, or less? If a man is
going east, can he not turn squarely ab;>ut and face toward the west fn the twinkling of an eye? That, so far in man's agency is
concerned, is conversion. It means simply that â¢ man start* upon an upright life; that he enters the school of Christ and begins
Christ's lessons. But is not a man lust as much in school when learning the alphabet as when poring over the mysteries of physical
science? It is astonishing tbat a man of your supposed caliber could put up such a man of straw as this and then proceed to beat
itdown for the edification of the sober minds of Berkeley Unitarianism. For you are aware that there are some "sober minis" par
excellence in that learned retreatâ minds tbat have "taken filial leave of suuiraiition. of blank authority, and of miraculism in
every form." So sober, forsooth, that they rush into print with untruthful introd'ictio.is to learned books, and then at the last
moment hasten to take back their sweeping and ill-consiiiered assertions.
I am only an obscure pastor, a believer in revivals and in in stamaneous conversions, a man sometimes given to that kind o f
religious drunk- nuess which "is no more worthy of respect t han the drunkenness whicli lies in gutters." But obscure aa lam
and unlearned, lam accustomed to think of ttio "sober mind" as characterized by firmness, by force, b/ staying qualities. It is
not one thing to-day and another to-morrow-a weather vane swinging In the wind. The chameleon, it is said, lanes on the color
of its environment; and so. it would seem, do certain scientiiic m-n of prominence, especially in matters of' religion You sir
are very well acqua.nted with a man wno. as professor in Butler University, at Indianapolis. w,as evangelically orthoJox in the'
Indiana State University was semi-orthodox, and to-day ai the hea l of Stanford University is ultra-radical and in outspoken an
tagonism to all orthodoxy. Hi, beliefs, you observe, have changed with nis surroundings; hi 9 cony ction* havebeen gelatinous
enough to accommodate themseives to circumstances, and all this in the exercise of "th 9 sober mind." Where the next evolution
will land him God only Knows, but evidently this man believes in doing in Rome what tha Romans do I need not add that the
great epoch-making men of the world have never been men of that stripe. Men who make history are neither m.n who drift nor
men who sneer. Yours, w.t respect, R â rOYr F

Jeffries, the champion heavy-weight
pugilist of Los Ang<-les, telegraphed to
his iimna er, Tom McDonald, of this City,
yesterday thai iJ the California Club
would have no objection he would train
for his light with Steizner in the southern
country.
One of the directors of the club who had
seen the message said that Jeffries must
train at some of the stations near tuis
City, as the committee which was ap
pointed to look i-fter the fighters and
report progress to the club must be within
courenient distance oi the men and .he

docs not fee! at ail anxious regnrdinc

which they propose to live up to, and the
rule reads mat the lighters matched l>y
the club must train at some place within

a|>i>ears thai the Irisii champion received
a letier Irom a friend in this City some
time u^o which stated that Sbitrkey posi
tively refused to meet a man of Maher'a
standing, who had b-en whipped by
second-ciass men, ami that lie would not
KSin anything by whipping second-raters.
The saaior champi >n had an idea once
upon a time that by touring through the
country towns giv.ng exhibitions of box
ing wiih one Jack Me AuMffe money would
fluv into his treasury box, ns the entire
country foik would turn out to see Cham
pion Tom in action.
The first exhibition of importance was
given m Sacramento, and ttie pr< ceeds of
the bouse amounted to something like
$200 dear of expenses. Jack McAuliffe
claiaifd $150 as his share, and the balance,
so it is mid, wan divided equally Ijetwet-n
Sharkey and his manager â a gentleman
known to the sporting fraternity as
"Bright Eyes."
Tom crew disgusted with the exhibition
business and refused to journey any
further with hi> company. On bis" return
to this City Sharkey held an interview
with Lynch and Needham, and n scheme
was concocted by which McAuiiife was
to get the worst ot the play. The story
goes that Tom happened accidentally, as it
were, into Corbett's emporium of sport,
and there he discovered Jack McAuliffe in
the act of quenching his tnirst
81appinc Jack on the back, Sbarkey put
on his best smile and si id:
"Jack, I've got a match for you, an*l we
can make a heap ol bluff out of it. What
do you think?' 1
"Weil, 1 would like to know who gave
you any authority to make a mutch for
me?" retorted McAuliffe, scornfully.
Sharkey knew enough to let well enough
aione when he saw that McAuliffe would
not stand any foolishness, so turning
quickly on his heels be left the sporting
quarters to report to bis friend Danny
tiittt the scheme would not work "i or "a
cent."
Those who are in the pugilistic swim
say that it whs Needham's intention to
meet McAuliffe in a six-round go "for
stuff," and that as Jack was in no condi
tion to "go" a speedy gait be would fall
very easy game to such a man as Needham.

able to put McAuiiffe to sleep when the
time arrived lor the closing scene.
But McAulifTe is too old a bird to be
caught napping and the scheme fell flat.
It is said mat McAuiiffe intends to re

entertainment which will be given to
him in New York in the very near future.

Session.
Motion Regarding Car-Rate Bills
Provokes a Heated
Debate.
Subj ct of G ades and Assessment
Commission Referred to Two
Committees.
The San Francisco Association of Im
provement Clubs held a meeting last night
in the B'nai B'rith Hall for the purpose
more particularly of considering a recom
mendation of the street committee oppos
ing the enactment of any street law wbich
provides for a commission to assess dam
ages, as proposed in Assembly bills 90 and
151 now before the Legislature.
The entire subject matter of street
grades, included in both bills, was referred
to the legislative and street committees,
with instructions for those committee!
to report to a special meeting of the asso
ciation next Saturday evening. There
was a large attendance of members, and
the discussion occasionally became so ani
mated tbat personal hostilities seemed
almost unavoidable.
This was especially the case when Vice-
President Grady, who presided, dfdared
out of order a resolution proposed by
Major McKinne, praying the Legislature
not to pass the Assembly and Senate
tramcar bills now being supported by As
semblyman Treacy and Senator Braun
hart, as substitutes for bills 30 and 270,
and providing that "no street rail
road within the corporate limits of muni
cipal corporations of the first class, within
the State, shall during the hours from 6
o'clock to 8 o'clock of the forenoon and
from 5 o'clock to 7 o'clock of the afternoon
charge or collect a higher rate of fare than
2}4 cents for each passeneer per trip over
any distance in one direction alone any
part of the whole length of the road and
its connections."
The pas age of these bills, the resolu
tion asserted, weald cause great injustice
and injury to the people of San Francisco
and the whole State of California.
Vic-President Graoy contended that
the association had already dealt with the
same question at a previous meeting.
Major McKinne appealed from his ruling.
Dr'C. D. balfield took the chair, and on
the question of reconsideration of the sub
ject referred to in the resolution a tie vote
resulted.
The chairman pro tern, gave a casting
vote in favor of consideration amid ter
rific uproar. Vice-President Grady de
clared a two-thirds majority was neces
sary to authorize reconsideration, and it
was then that a wild scene of disorder and
mutual recrimination endued. The matter
ended in the defeat of the motion to re*
cunsider, and the meeting adjourned in
confusion and at midnight.
On the reading of the street commit*
tee's recommendation, Judge Van Reyne
gom moved that this resolution be laid on
the table, Decau-e the subject-matter bad
already been laid before another commit
tee of the association, and the street com
mittee, therefore, had nothing to do with
it, and had in dealing with it acted in an
ex-parte manner.
This proposition provoked emphatic op
position and was voted down on division.
Mr. O'Leary then moved that the report
of (he committee be adopted.
T. F. Heggarty proposed as an amend
ment to the amendment that the bill pro
posed by the Merchants' Association and
indorsed by the Civic Federation be ap
proved as a snbstitute.
Mr. O'Leary moved that the entire sub
ject-matter of street grades included in
uoth bills be committed to the legislative
committee and committee on streets, said
comtn ittees to render a report at the next
meeting.
At this juncture Mr. Scheerer rose ex
citedly and addressing Mr. Kosentbal
asked that gentleman if his complaint of
unfair treatment referred to himself, Mr.
Scheerer?
Mr. Kosenthal â You and the street com
tee?
Mr. Scheerer then proceeded to roast
the bill, which he characterized as a
measure which neither a layman nor a
lawyer conld understand.
Mr. O'Leary's motion then carried, to
gether with an additional resolution, re
questing the legislative and street com
mittees 10 report to a special meeting next
Saturday.
A communication received from prop
erty - owners and residents on Point
Lobos avenue and tbe Cliff House road,
pi'titionini? the association to look into
the matter of the improvement of the
driveway from First avenue to the Cliff
House, was Indorsed.
The following petition was supported by
Judge Van Reynegom and unanimously
adopted as the sense of the association:
To the Honorable Senate and Assembly of the
State of Californiaâ Gentlemen: The under
signeu citizens of California, who are engaged
iv industrial pursuits, respectfully remon
strate against the passage Oi any law which
brines convict labor in competition with free
while labor. We respectfully remonstrate
iu-ainst the pasÂ«aee of any measure providing
for the crushing of rock at Folsoui prison to be
used for street or concreting purposes within
any town or city of the Stale.
We object to this because there are a large
number of our fellow-clttzens now engaged in
quarrying ttone and preparing it for macad
amizing and concreting purposes in the vari
ous rim-s of this Stnte, and who thus support
their families; and such labor cannot com
pete with convict labor in Hint line.
We do not object to the sale of rock by the
State for county road purposes.
A series of resolution? from the Iroquois
Clu'> opposing increase of official expendi
tures on the part of the Legislature except
in tne case of tbe Fire Department was
discussed, and a motion finally passed to
the effect that tbe Iroquois Club be com
municated with and informed that the
association has already taken action in
this matter and is opposed to tbe increase
of salaries whatsoever, and that the secre
tary be notified to instruct every member
of the San Francisco delegation in both
houses to this effect.
A resolution moved by Dr. Sal f eld was
unanimously adopted extending the
thank a of the association to the Board of
Supervisors, and particularly to Super
visor Kotlanzt, for "the stand they have
taken in favor of the people in advance
ment of their rights and against the bold
and outrageous attempt to rob them of
their rights."
C. D. Mark, B. Joost, M. F. Taylor and
Vice-Presulent Grady were recommended
to the Mayor to be placed on a committee

Most people, hardly realize that headaches and dyspepsia and r.
other miseries all oome from one cause, and that taking- a separate . J !
remedy for each symptom is like pioking the leaves off an obnoxious \a i
tree instead of striking at the root. Headache, or sluggishness, or f n
disordered stomach or constipation or offensive breath show that A I
either the etomach or bowels or the liver are not doing their natural A
work, and : . p
R SPANS TABULES %
Go to the root of all these, difficulties by immediately correcting . I 'l
the stomach and gently stimulating the liver and bowels to healthy i fir.
action. These Tabules are the accurate prescription of a regular ' 1 S 111
physician; they are a simple remedy, as mild yet certain as If I* ' /
nature itself. To people of sedentary habits, professional and busi- '1 .i ~â  - >

many a serious illness with its long train of suffering and expense. / \Ajf

Water and Water Supply Com
/ mittee Arranges th.3 Pre
liminaries.
The â¢ Company's Report Obj cted To
Yesterday, and Additional De
:. " ' tails Demanded.
. The Water Committee of tho Board of
Supervisors held an important session yes
terday afternoon preparatory to initiating
'an inquiry into the affairs of the Spring
"Valley Water Company for the purpose of
"fixing rates for the ensuing year.
â ' Dr. C. A., Clinton, who presided, drafted
a request for a series of detailed statements
from the company which will be forward*
ed forthwith. The committee also recom
mended -the board to instruct that an in-
, vestigatio.n be made into the outside
â sources of water supply for the purpose
.oT reporting upon and acquiring the same.
f will be moved at the next meeting of
the board that the latter meet as a com
mittee of the whole to discuss these mat
ters in detail, and at yesterday's meeting
the chairman of the board was empowered
to procure the services of a stenographer
to take evidence on behalf of the City.
The. other members of the committee
-.present yesterday were Supervisors Dodge,
'â¢'Britt, Rivers and Rottanzi. and Mayor
Plie'aawas also in attendance.
Â°Â° '.The report submitted by the Spring
j Valley Water Company was first dealt
with and objected to as mucn too vague
in character. Mayor Pheian pointed out
.that.' the information given as to receipts
and disbursements was. insufficient, and
that the names of ratepaverswere no ar
ranged in alphabetical order.
It was at this juncture that Dr. Clinton
suggested that the following communica
tion, requesting additional particulars be
â¢forwarded to the company:
â Charles Webb Howard Esq., President Spring
â  Valley Water Companyâ Dear Sir: At a meet-
. lug- of the Committee on Water and Water
Supply of the Board of Supervisors, held this
day, the following detailed information was,
. pursuant to the statutes, required to be fur
nished by your company, to enable the board
to intelligently pass upon and determine the
water rates to be fixed and established for the
year commencing July 1, 1897. As the Board
of Supervisors will meet in committee of the
. whole In the first part of next week I am me
e .ructed to request you to furnish these state
ments on or prior to Wednesday, the 10th
lnÂ»t., to wit:
â¢ .Detailed statement of the expenditure in
curred under the heading 01 operating ex
penses; detailed statement of taxes paid in
the different counties, and the assessed value
of property belonging to the company; de
.ailed statement of the real property owned by
the- company, used in the supply of water,
together with its original cost and its present
valuation; detailed statement of improvements
owoe'd by the company, their valuation and
the uses to which they are devoted; detailed
statement of the personal prop rty owned by
the; company. Its valuation, condition and the
tises to which it is applied; detailed statement
of the pumping: plants, location, capacity, va -
uation and the cost of maintenance; d tailed
i -lenient of the amount of water drawn from
*â¢ 1 ;urnishea from the different sauries for j
. ..; supply of the city and county and its in- i
habitants; detailed statement of the amount
paid on account of new construction and for
permanent improvements; detailed statement
Â©i the amount of bonds issued, outstanding
and.the rate of interest paid :hereon ; detailed
statement of the stock issued, and by whom
li*ld, and the amount of dividends paid there
en during the year; detailed statement ot the
amount of bonds and stock bold durinsr the
year 1896 and the amount realized thereon
tna-ii-s. disposition.
The committee further requests you to ex
plain your system 01 keeping the ratepayers'
account-, in order to enable tnis committee to
verify your statements and the reason why it
is not arranged in alphabetical order for refer
ence. Charles a. Clinton.
Chairman Committee Water and Water Supply.
â  â¢ The foregoing was adopted. The Mayor
â Eaid that the company bad failed to com
ply with the statute, inasmuch us the
names of some of the largest ratepayers
did not appear in the report.
On motion of Supervisor Dodge, the
clerk of the board was directed to have
the figures piven in the report added, in
order to ascertain if the totals given were
correct.
Dr. Clinton informed the committee
that last Sunday, accompanied by As
eistant Chief Engineer ShaUEhnessy, he
had- Jiiven over the creater portion of the
City, and that during the tour they found
quite a number of hydrants which, in the
engineer's judgment, could - be dispensed
wijtb ; notably at the old racegrounde. In
the course of a block and a half they
found .ten hydrants protecting three or
lour empty shed*. Six at least, in the en
gineer's opinion, conld be removed, and
thereby effect a savins of . $30 a month.
Throughout the City fifty or .sixty could
be done away with on three or four inch
mains.
The clerk said that the Fire Department
would not recommend anything smaller
than a six-incn main, except in isolated
' cases. As to the hydrants at the race
track, Bbausrhnessy Lad explained that the
old sheds referred to were occupied by a
lot of stock kept there until recently.
In the course of further discussion, Dr.
Cinton stated that in his opinion all the
hydrants recommended by Chief Sullivan
â wera really needed, and though * there
Ss ; ere sixty hydrants of insufficient capa
city, it would not be wis* to deprive the
"GUy of them, but that larger mains should
â be laid to these hydrant?, as the Engineer
advised. The latter was now engaged in
preparing a map, whicn would show the
location of every hydrant in the City.
I)r. Clinton also informed the committee
that in New York the hydrants were not
more than 250 feet apart, while Here the
'Interval was three times as great.
. An examination of the company's rate
schedule revealed the fact that no dis
tinction was ma ie between rates as ap
plied to public or private dwellings- and
in this connection it was stated that the
.Girls' High School was charged $24 for
â water last month.
"Supposing." said Dr. Clinton, "we
placed, a meter in one of these schools
and" found that it registered only $10 or
$15. Would we be compelled under con
tract to pay $24 or $25?"
Toe clerk replied affirmatively.
The Mayorâ To apply the same rate to
Vublic buildings and dwelling-houses is
preposterous. In ihe one case no water is
used except for drinking. There should
be a separate schedule.
Finally on the motion of Supervisor
Britt it was decided to recommend the
board to" instruct the Water Inspector to
place meters in the following institutions:
'en man, Horace Mann and Wtiittier
schools, the City and County Hospital
and the Alta plaza.
George Maxwell, secretary of the Fire
Department, waited on the committee to !
give the members verbal information re
specting the bill now before the State Leg
islature providing for a fireboat to be
built at the expense of the State and as
signed by. the Governor to any municipal
i-ty desirous of using it, in which case
such municipality will be required to man
and operate it at its own expense. .Mr. j
Maxwell said that the present boats bo
longing to the State were nothing but tug
boats, and, as. they drew twelve feet of
water, they could not run into .shallow
places. The bill Drovides lor a boat of
The Water and Water Supply Committee of the Board of Supervisors as It Sat in Session Yesterday
and Discussed Water Rates*
8000 gallons capacity per minute, or equal
to nine of tbe City's first-cia-s steam hre
engines, and for a speeJ of twenty miles
an hour. The post of such a boat would be
$75,000.
The Mayor declared that the expense of
maintenance should properly be support
ed out of the shipping tolls, which were
collected by the State. It would be prefer
able for the City to buy the boat 11" the
State would maintain it.
Mr. Maxwell said an arrangement of
that kind would result in perpetual clash
ing between the Harbor Commissioners
and the Fire Department.
The Mayor â Let the City pay for it only j
on the understanding that the Fire De- i
partrnent issues all orders. .
Mr. Maxwell thought that Sm Fran
cisco should both provide and maintain
a boat itself, as o:her large cities do.
Trie Mayorâ And other citips collect toll
and wharfage, which are a great source of
revenue.
In the absence of further business the
committee adjourned.

NATIONAL BANK STOCK.
Tbe Supreme Court Decides That It
Canuot Be Taxed in This
State.
Shares of National Bank stcck are not
subject to assessment for purpofes of
taxation. That was the decision handed
down by the Supreme Court yesterday.
An agreed case was brought before the
court by O. McHenry and various other
stockholders of tbe First National Bank
of Modesto, against the Tax Collector of
Stanislaus County, W. A. Downer.
McHeury'B and Ins associates' stock was
assessed and the Tax Collector tried to
make collection.
His authority to do this was questioned

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1897.
NO MORE, SAYS
JUDGE SEAWELL
There Is a Sufficient Num
ber of Superior Judges
at Present.
Any Increase Would Be In
jurious to the Public
Interests.
Mayor Pheian Will Present This
Opinion to tbe Legislators at
Sacramento To-Day.
Presiding Judge Seawell of the Superior
Court has given his opinion to Mayor
l'aeian that there is no necessity for an
increase in the number of Judges of tbe
Superior Court in this City and Couuty.
Moreover, he says that such increase
would be injurious to the public interests,
"and would impair rather than promote
the efficiency of the court."
This opinion was elicited by a letter
written to Juiite Seawell by Mayor
Pheian. The proposed increase in ex
penses for salaries, in one way and an
other, for this City and County amounts
in round figures to $125,000 per annum.
This amount has attracted much atten
tion and Mayor Pheian has set. about to
see what the situation is, and on the Ist
of the month he addressed the followine
letter:
San Francisco, February 1, 1897.

there is now a bill pending tor three addi
tional courts for this jurisdiction. Yours,

TYLER NOT ILL USED.
Hi* Attorneys, After Investigating His
Story, Refuse to Institute Suit
for Damages.
The suit for damages which Llewellyn
Tyler threatened to institute against tne
Facinc Coast Steam-hip Company on ac
count, of alleged ill treatment received on
a recent trip on the steamer Walla Walla
from Seattle to this City has been aban
doned.
Delmas it Bhortridge, wbo were retained
by Tyler to press his claims, withdrew
from the case yesterday. After investi
gating his story, which was published in
the newspapers, the a torneys are satis
lied that the steamer officials did all in
their power to assist the inval.d on the
voyage. They have learned from Captain
Wallace that Tyler was removed from
tne steerage apartments to a place on the
deck at tbe advice of a physician who was
summoned in the case. Steerage Steward
James Parks says that Tyler misrepre
sented the tacts in tbe case. He gave out
thÂ« following official statement oi the in
cident yesterday:
1, being steerage steward, was among one oi
the first to accost him of ills ailment, and the
answer was that he Had blood-poisoning iv his
knee. Leaving Seait.e on Tuesday morning
at 8 o'clock, he came up to the table at every
meal up to Thursday morning, and dined
heartily, wnen about 10 o'clock he took a con
vulsion fit.
Every one laid the cause to the blood-poison
ing iv his knee, lie continued taking fits
every hour all day. Wheu in the aueruoon
the captain hud him carried up to the 'tween
decks tor better ventilation, and also that two
men could attend to him, as it took two men
to hold him down and to attend to htm prop
erly; also the captain ana chief steward both
attended to him considerably all that after
noon, iv the way of getting chopped ice and
chicken broth, beef lea and also brandy, and
an v thing else they thought of, to help allay bis
sufferings for humanity's sake, and In their
official capacity did everything iv their power.
The chief steward was Inquiring about his rel
atives, when one ot the PHssengers gave him &
letter be had taken from his pocket, in view of
the passengers, because we ail thought that be
could not live, but there was no one looked for
any money. All the belongings he had visible
were v pair of blue pants wrapped la a paper,
besides what he wore.
He was laid on two good mattresses with
covers on and two pillows with covers, with
two double heavy gray blankets to cover him.
I waa attending to litm until 12 o'clock that
night with the assistance of others, when I
weuf to my room, leaving the night watchman
with three or lour other men to attend to him
the balance of the night. When I got up
In the morning tney told me he had six
convulsions from 4 to 6, and ao on up to 7
o'clock. The ship arriving In port, the sur
geon of the port came and made an examina
tion to see if there was any Infectious dis
ease; he found none, but said he wotud have
to be taken to the hospital. The chief
steward having his father's address
from the letters he had Jo bis pocket
sent a waiter after his father, and It took
about two hours to flud him. When his father
cume he was pleased to recognize me and
.shook me by the hand, as be had known me
some years previous. Later, when he took his
sou away in the ambulance, he shook hands
with me very cordially and thanked me very
much for what I had done for his sod, instead
of, as stated iv your paper, almost having a
tijtht. In fact, he received ah the kind treat
meu t that human bauds could give. Evidence
of the truth of ay statement can be glvea;
therefore, in justice to my employers and also
tome, 1 request you to contradict tbe iase
statements made in your paper by inserting
mv testimony. Respectfully yours,
James Parks, Steerage Steward.
I certify that the above statement is correct,
Thomas Wallace, Master.

DEATH IEOM TWO CAUSES.
Heart Disease and Cm Asphyxia Oxer
take Mrs. Catherine Chenot.
Mrs. Catherine Chenot, a widow resid
ing at 921 Valencia street, was found dead
on the floor of her room yesterday by her
son, Eutene Chenot, who, noticing the
odor of gas in the hallway, went to bis
mother's room, which was filled with tne
gas, which flowed from an open jet. Near
by was another jet, which was lighted.
The young man ran for Dr. Cook, who
lives near by, but the woman bad ap
parently been dead several hours.
Dr. Cook stated that Mrs. Chenot had
been Buffering for months with a compli
cation of heart troubles. He believes that
she must have lighted one of tbe jets and
was overcome by her heart troubles and
failed to reach the other jet with toe
match. Death was due partly to heart
troubles and partly to asphyxia. The de
ceased was possessed of considerable prop
erty. She wae 65 years of age and a na
tive of Ireland.
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
COLONEL YOUNG
AGAIN VICTIMIZED
Cashier E. W. Schubert
Is a Heavy De
faulter.
An Expert Has BeeD Examining
His Books for Several
Days.
Schubert Fled Last Tuesday, but Has
Bsen Arrestei in Yuma,
Arizcna
Colonel Young, proprietor of th a Russ
House, seems to be singularly unfortunate
with the men be employs as casftier.
la October, 1895, E. W. ScLubert was
strongly recommended to him as a suitable
person to occupy tbe position of cashier,
and he was promptly engaged.
Every tuing went well till about ten days
ago, when Young's suspicions were aroused
that something was wrong with Schubert's
account?. He asked him several times to
get his books in shape for inspection, but
on each occasion Schubert feigned sick
ness, until Young's patience became ex
hausted.
Thursday last an expert was called in
and Young introduced him to Schubert
and asked Schubert to render him every
assistance in straightening out his books.
That night Schubert sti.l feigned sickness,
but promised to be at bis desk the follow
ing rnornine. be appeared Friday morn
ing, but left almost immediately afterward
and did noi return.
The expert continued working on the
books, and Tue day morning he reported
to Young that so far he had discovered a
deficiency in Schubert's accounts of be
tween $800 and $1000.
Captain L -es was at once notified, and
Detective Ross Whitaker was detailed on
the case. He procured the assistance of
Policeman J. B. Freel, and they found
that Schubert had gone to Alameda Mon
day evening. From there they traced him
to Seventh street and Broadway, Oakland,
and found that he purchased a first-class
ticket for Ei Paso.Tex.
Chief Crowley wired to Los Angeles,
Yuma, Ariz., and Â£1 Paso, giving a full
description of Schubert, and asking that
he be arrested for felony embezzlement.
La-t night a dispatch was received from
J. J. Kenna, City Marshal of Yuma, that
Schubert had been arrested on the train
there, and was being detained pending the
arrival of an officer.
Detective Wtiitaker will leave for Sacra
mento this evening with the paper-* for
Schubert's extradition to be signed by
Governor Budd and he will then continue
hia journey to Arizona to bring Schubert
back.
Schnbert went to Alameda Monday
night with one Hosmer, a guest of the
Rusb House, and according to the story
they occupied the same room. Hosmer
returned and it was with difficulty he
could be made to teil of his connection
with Scl'ubert.
The dedication in all will amount to
about $1200. Schubert was a very obliging
man, and it is a mystery to everybody
why he has got hiraaeli into such trouble.
Two attaches beiore him, in a compara
tively recent time, went the same road,
both being defaulters. One. A. W. Seeley,
fled to Stfhta Clara, let his beard grow and
married again, lie is now serving a term
in the State prison.
Scnuoert was in the employ of Colonel
Young first during the Midwinter Fair.
Then he returned to Colorado, where he
had been before. He was at one time
manager of the Hotel Oxford in Denver
and later of the Grand Central at Pueblo.
Prior to this he wac for some years man
ager of tlie Tretnom House, Red Bluff.
"He gave perfect satisfaction when he
was with me first as room clerk," said
Colonel Young, "and 1 readily employed
him afterward as cashier and bookkeeper.
I believed implicitly in his honesty."
It seems that during the past few
months Schubert has been living far be
yond his means. The American Surety
Company had a $2000 policy guaranteeing
the young man's honesty. Inspector
Seybold has been looking up the matter
in conntction with Mr. Atkinson, the ex
pert.
Schubert was about 40 years old and
was unmarried. He had purchased a first
class limited ticket for Â£1 Paso. He had
allowed his cash book to remain for about
two months unposted, and when Colonel
Young spoke to him about it he pleaded
be had been unwell.

THE BROTHER SUED
HIS AGED SISTER
Claimed That She Owed
Him Money for Services
Rendered.
She Testified She Had Practically
Supported Him Thirty
Years.
Justice Groezinger Listened Astonished
to tha Testimony and Found
for the Sister.
A strange suit was on trial yesterday
afternoon before Justice of the Peace
Groezinger. It was of sufficient interest
to bring to the courtroom a large number
of residents of the Potrero, who filled all
the chairs of the court, and the overflow
formed a ragged shaped human fringe of
men. who stood as spectators for some
time.
The story which was the motive in the
proceedings was drawn out by the examina
tion of several witnesses. It was a simple
story, but replete with a pathos, involv
ing the traditional long suffering and end
less patient affection of woman and the
ingratitude of man. The litigants are
brother and sister. He was the plaintiff
and she the defendant. The title of the
nuit was James Delmera against Catherine
T. Williams.
Mrs. Williams is an elderly woman, a
widow, who is the proprietress of the
Pennsylvania Hotel at 226 Michigan
street. James Delmere is also elderly.
He was a soldier in the Civil War. At
times he has been in the Soldiers' Home
at Yountville, in this State. Both are
well known In the Potrero, one for the de
voted care she has bestowed upon her
brother during a period exceeding a gene
ration in length.
The chief interest in the case was when
Mrs. Williams took the witness-stand.
She testified that >he had practically sup
ported her brother thirty years. He had
been at Yountviile for a time. He broke
his collar-bone. She welcomed him to her
home because he was helpless. She nursed
him, gave him spending money and was
kind to him. She supported him. Con
cerning the claim he made agsinst her to
recover $249 for services, she testified that
he had performed no services for her. He
had spent much of his time drinking, she
said, and she supplied him with tobacco.
The woman looked weary as she detailed
these facts.
Justice Groezinger decided the case for
the defendant sister in a very few words.
"The case is all one-sided," he said, "and
I will bnd for the defendant, with costs."
The brother bad no money with which to
pay the cost?, and they were waived.
WHITE GOES TO PRISON.
The Supreme Court Affirms tbe Deci
siou of an Attempt to Commit
Burglary.
Tbe case of William White, convicted ol
an attempt to commit burglary in tbe
first degree, was finally disposed of by the
Supreme Court yesterday. It came before
that tribuoal on appeal from tne judg
ment an I an order denying a new trial.
Tbe indictment charged a burglarious
entry of a bouse situated at 45 South Park,
this City, beionging to John Doe. Tbe
evidence showed conclusiy- y thai White
was guilty of tbe crime, but tbe point was
made that tbe indictment was defective,
inasmuch as the evidence snowed th
property to be that of one Letitia Bagnall.
The court considered tbe mere statemeut
of the point a sufficient answer to it.
Another poinr, that tbe trial Judge bad
refused tbe request of the defendant to
send a jury to view tbe premises, was de
cided to be a matter depending entirety
on the Judge's discretion.
Other minor points made were also con
sidered irrelevant. Therefore no error was
found in tbe record and the judgment
and order appealed from were affirmed.

Oregon Navigation stock had been sold to parties
â¢ friendly to t*e Northern Pacific-Great Northern-

be no cutting of rates or diversion of traffic in the

CHICAGO MAKKETS.
CHICAGO, li.v. Feb. 3 The bulging pro
pensity of wheat was evident In the market for
that grain this morning. Prices were not essen
tially different from the closing ones of yesterday,
but shor.ly after the opening there was a shooting
upward, the strength giving some concern to the
bear raiders who were prominent on the recent
break. .St. Louis led tee bull movement, and an
advance of Vi e at that place started â¢â¢shorts" to
buying here. Liverpool quoted 8/id advance,
thereby coinciding with the strength on this side
of yes.erday.
. Reports that the French crop will bo one-third
less than last year had a strei g:henlng eff â¢ c .
Receipts at Chicago were 28 cars and 20,830
bushels were withdrawn from store. The Nortli
west had 224 cars againu 62 last Wednesday
and 416 a year a.o. The strength disappeared
irum the market before noon, prices settling be
low yesterday's closing, with business becoming
dull and almost stagnant. Closing Berlin and
Paris cab.es were higher and Antwerp unchanged.
Export clearances were ridiculously small, at
26.1t>7 bushels, that fact counting against prices
very plainly and causing a break at the close.
May wheat opened from 76c to 75*4& sold be
tween 76% c and 74 yg's7sc, closing at tue Inside,
s s*&~n c uuder yesterday. Estimated receipts for
to-morrow, 17 cars No. 2 red spot wheat ranged
from t<4c to 86% c, closing about. 84@&5c.
CORN- Opened quite firm, eased off and then
became ste, dier. Owing to the very small busi
ness, prices changed but slightly. The strength
in wht at early in the session did not set m io exert
much Influence in corn. Very poor grading of
corn has a depressing effect on the cash market,
and that In turn affects the futures. Receipts to
day were 336 cars, and - 100,766 bushels were
taken trom store. Liverpool cables were quiet
and unchanged. Export clearances were 166.519
bushels. The slump In wheat near the close car
ried corn off, and the final quotations were tee
lowest of the day. May corn opened at 24% c. de
clined to and closed at 24c, s/ 8 c under yesterday.
Estimated receipts (or to-morrow 575 cars.
u.Â»iS>â The oat market dragged and was from
steady to easy In tone. The feeling was. to some
extent, governed by that of wheat. Trading was
local and without feature. Receipts were 181 cars.
There was none withdrawn from store. The close
was weak; May oats closed 3/s@%c under yester
day. Estimated receip.s for to-morrow 264 cars.

was a revival of sentiment, early buyers turning
sellers and other purchasers deserting tne market.

UNION STOCKYARDS. 111.. Feb. 3.-There
is ho decrease In cattle receipts, only 29,600 arriv
ing for the first half of the week. Expectations
were for a good run to-day, but only 12,000 bead
came in. The quality of most of .he offerings
were very poor, showing a lack of feeding. The
light supply imparted strength to the market, but
with the exception of choice stock, which was 10c
higher, prices were no belter. The ret jrn of mild
weather causes a freer movement of hogs, over
107,000 head arriving during the firs half of the

week, and 63, 608 for the corresponding three days
a ear ago. The market wat active at from 2 V?@

COALâ A circular for Australia says: "The very
small receipt o Coals for the pas' thirty days have
aided to materially reduce the present stocks of
Australian la yard, still there has been no change
in values, as there Is an ample' quantity of other
gruic â . on hand to supply all immediate demands.
The total amount- of Australian to arrive In the
next sixty days does not fool up 20. 000 tons, so
that arrivals of Colonial cannot disturb the mar
ket. There have been liberal engagements of Coal
tonnage from Newcastle tor late loading at about
12s 6d per ton. Most of iheitecareoe* have been
uUpo.edof some time since to some of our Urge
consumers. Tne difference In freight rate* be
tween English and Australian Coal shipments will
seriously diminish sales of the former and lead to
liberal contracts being made for the Utter. The
present outlook for a bounteous harvest Is very
encouraging, signifying a lar<e number of carriers
;to transport our crop. This will necessarily lean to
an Influx of vessels, tnree- fourths of which will be
Coal carriers, thus assuring us a full supply of for
eign coal (principally Australian) the latter por
tion of the year. The Increased rate of Insurance
placed on Wallseud Coal Is causing liberal ship
ment of lower-priced grades from Newcastle! Wel

Alameda Has a Kindly
Interest in Little Crip
.. . pled Georgie.
His Father, Who Is Not an
. American, Is Required to
â¢. Make a Promise,
Agrees That He Will Not Strike His
Boy Until th-2 Tay After
Disobedience.
Oakland Office Saw Frakcisco Call,)
â¢ Â° â¢ â¢ â¢jOS Broadw..y, Feb. 3. j
"A delegation of people from Alameda
visited Mrs. Prescott, secretary of the
"Children's Society, yesterday in the inter
est of a little cripple boy named Georgie
.Campbell, both of whose legs were cut off
below the knee by a train.
A few nights ago little Georgia ran into
the, home of Mr. and .Mrs. Hanson, who
live near by, and told them he was afraid
lo : go to his own home, because his parents
wjt uld beat him. Mr. Hanson took him
â jÂ¥tnic and pleaded lor him, but notwith
|<i:i:i>iine Georgie'a father was about to
VrWka him in Hanson's presence, when
*.-:>.Â» latter staled that no one should strike
a cripple in his sight. Hanson left, but he
ho sooner got outside the door than he
/heard the boy screaming, and knew what
had Happened. The people of Alameda
â¢consider that they have an interest in
little Georgie, because the coalyard which
-his father manages bears the sign, "Little '
Georgia's Coalyard," and they have fre
quently patronized it from feelings of
sympathy and charity.
. Campbell's father is proud of two
.'things and frequently boasts of them:
! One is that he is a Scotchman, another is
that he is not an American, and he resents
. any. interference with his family affairs,
even by those who are commissioned to
carry out American law.
â ; Mrs. Prescott went to Alameda and in
vestigated the case and left word for Mr.
Campbell to come over and see her. His
wile stated that he most certainly would
not come, but nevertheless he appeared at
the office of the society this morning.
.After a conversation witn Mrs. Prescott,
he very defiantly stated that he would
manage his children in his own way, al
thougn he acknowledged that his other
two boys had already run away from
home and ihat Georgie could not for want
of legs. Mrs. Prescott told Campbell that
nhe would require from him a guarantee
that Georgie should not be ill treated lor
the next three months or else she would
prosecute. Campbell haughtily turned
and went out of the office.
A few minutes later he returned and
asked' what kind of a guarantee was
meant. He was told that his word would
be considered sufficient, and after a little
conversation he promised that he would
not strike the boy, no matter what he did,
when- he was angry, and would not punish
him for any offense till the day after it oc
curred', and at the end of three months he
promised to- again come and see the sec-
I Te\ary.
i .".Mr. Campbell is a firm believer in de-
Liaanding certain things of his children,"
paid Mrs. Prescott. "According to our
idea he carries this thing 100 far, and as
long as he has put up a sign that appeals
to the charity of Alamedans, because of
his son.- misfortune, they were naturally
hurt when they knew that little Georgie
h:.d gone to some one's house for protec
â¢ tion. Campbell is a very stern parent,
.but I believe he* is a trustworthy man,
"â  and I have every confidence that he will
keep his word regarding his boy. From
what he tells me, Georgie is a long way
from.being an angel and certainly de
serves punishment, but being a criprle
â¢Ire. is certainly deserving of a little
cnarity."
â  ' Meanwhile, the friends of little Georgie
are congratulating themselves that his
stern father, who boasts of not being an
' American, has been given to understand
that so long as he lives here certain little
legal ideas must be obeyed.

. little gathering of houses near the foot of Broadway that constituted the Oakland

known engineer. During all her life Mrs. Hougbam has been known as a chari

LEGISLATORS ON RECORD.
Tell the Equality Society Their Ideas
of Suffrage.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 3.â The Political
Equality Society of Alameda County held
a very lively meeting yesterday afternoon.
There was a heated debate over some
points of parliamentary law, which the
president, Mrs. Isabel Baldwin, very
quietly settled, according to a ruling
made by Susan B. Anthony. The
trouble arose over the election of the new
recording secretary, and Mrs. Alfred
Stebbins was elected. Mrs. Morris Wood
hams and Mrs. Olive Babcock figured in
the debate, but their points of order were
either not well taken or wer â¢ considered
as being out of order, for they received no
recognition from the chair, and when the
minutes of this meeting are submitted for
approval at the next gathering there will
likely be a strenuous effort made to have
them altered.
The following resolution, which was
passed at a previous meeting, has been
sent to the Alamedn delegation at Sacra
mento: "Resolved, that members of the
State Legislature wh ) represent tin
county of AhimeJa be and nereby are
most earnestly requested to uÂ«e their in
fluence in favor of ;i resubmittini: oi the

were in favor ol'resuhjmissiun. Assembly
man North said he would give the mailer
consideration and Assemblyman Leavitt
promised to <Jo the same, nltbough he
frankly confessed he was opposed to the
amendment.
MONEI AGAINST MEMBERS.
The Question Agitating the Centennial
Prrsbytefian <â  hurch.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 3.â The meeting
of the Oakland Presbytery last evening at
the Centennial Presbyterian Church has
left a bad state of affairs and more will be
heard of the mattor in a short time. Tne
Rev. R. X Coyle, D.D., in speaking of the
affair, says: "From what I can gather,
not being acquainted with ihe details, I
think there must be a wide division in
the church. There seems to be a pre
ponderance of money on one side and a
lar^e majority of the members of the
church on the other."
Dr. Ellis made the following statement
to-day:
In the matter of the Centennial Church
the status is that after preaching two monihs
to tae congregation the elders a->ked Dr. Ellis
to write hit terms upon which he would accept
a call. One tnintr he specified which has be
come the bone of contention, to wit: "I will
not consent to be installed until the congrega
tion can pay the salary of $2<KK)." He has ad
hered to that as the basis of contract and
steadily declines to be installed up to this
time. The majority of the trustees and a mi
nority of the elders, together with that por
tion of the church bearing the financial bur
den, stand with Dr. KUiÂ». The complainants
are the same as those who opposed Rev. Camp
bell Coyle two years ago, from which the
church nas not recovered. The result of the
meeting of the presbytery last evening was to
refer the matter to the congregation In the
Immediate-future and then the presbytery for
final action.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1897.
FERRO DENIES IT ALL
His Boy Was Not Shot to
Death at the Whittier
Reform School.
Portuguese Greatly Concerned
Over the Story About One
of Their Number.
An Editor Was Cruelly Imposed Upon
and Wi 1 Publish a Full
Explanation.
Oakland Office Sait Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 3. )
The Portuguese residents in the vicinity
of Haywards are considerably worked up
over a story that was published in th*
Portuguese Daper last weeK. The article
that has aroused their indignation refers
to the son of one of their number, who
recently died at the Whittier Reform
Fchodi.
It states that Frank Ferro, the son of
Frank and Mary Ferro of Haywards, was
shot and beaten to death at the echooi.
The Dumps and Stagnant Pools Which Threaten the Lives of 500 Schoolchildren and Which the
Board of Health Has Been Asked to Improve.
This story has been denied by the parents
and an investigation is being made and
the editor of the paper has promised that
he will publish the explanation next
Saturday.
The translation of the article is as fol
lows: "Was buried last Sunday Frank
Ferro, aged 15 years, son of Frank and
Mary Ferro. The boy died at the Reform
School, where he was sent on correction
on account of his bad habits. He at
tempted several times to run away and it
is said his death was not natural, but from
being s.ot and the beating be received at
the school. There was no autopsy, but
the fact of his beine sent in the coffin
already dressed for burial indicates a
suspicion."
Mr. Ferro indignantly denies that his
son was ill treated. He say-, that death
was due to natural causes and that his son
was sent home in a coffin decently pre
pared for burial. He is of the opinion
that some one imposed on the editor of
the Portuguese paver to gratify some pri
vate purpose, and he is making earnest in
quiry to get at the bottom of the whole
matter.

A BOG ADJOINS
THE SCHOOL HOUSE
It Menaces the Health of
Five Hundred School
Children.
Parents Petition the Board of
Health to at Once Give
Them Relief.
Microbes From a Stagnant Lake and
Garbage Float Through the
Windows.
Oakland Ottick San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 3. )
The Board of Health has been asked by
the parents of 500 school children to pro
tect the lives of their little ones by abat
ing as soon as possible the unsightly bog
and dumuine-ground that is located di
rectly to windward of the Tompkins
School.
The petition expresses in a very mild
manner the feeling of the people in the
neighborhood. For several yearsj^tbc
whole block surrounded by Seventh,
Fifth, Adeline and Chestnut streets has
been a dangerous pond of filth, and the
opposition to it manifested by the resi
dents and the baneful effect it has had
upon the health of the children and
teachers of the school have hitherto had
no effect.
Principal Markbara of the Tompkins
School has moved in a very guarded man
ner in the premises and has been instru
mental in bringing the matter to the at
tention of the Board of Health, and now
the matter of abating the nuisance has
been thrown directly on the shoulders of
the Health Officer, Dr. Bradley.
The City Attorney has advised the
Health Officer to commence a criminal
action against the owners of the property
for maintaining the nuhance. "I believe
this is the safest thing to do," said City
Attorney Peirsol. "The city should po
ahead and fill the pond with good soil,
but it might be hard to collect the cost
from the owners. There are other ways
of abating the nuisance, bat the quickest
and safest way would be to arrest the
owners ol the property for maintaining a
public nuisance."
Councilman Heitman obtained a prom
ise some time ago from the owners that
they would till in the bog when the city
graded and macadamized the streets
around it. This was don;, but the prom
ise was not kept, and Mr. Heitman said
to-day that if it were necessary he would
do his best to secure an appropriation
from the Council for the purpose of prose
cuting a criminal action against the
owners.
The petition, which people are readily
signingâ especially those whose children
are attending the school â is as follows:
To the Board of Health of the City of Oaklandâ
Gentlemen: We, the undersigned residents
and property-holders in the vicinity of the
stagnant pond situate! between Third and
Fifth streets and Chestnut and Adeline streets,
do earnestly petition you to take immediate
steps to have this long-standing nuisance
abated. We respectfully recommend that the
pond, or bog, be filled in with good, clean
Boil. All attempts to drain the pond are of no
avail. It is a quagmire, covered with green
scum, and for many months in the year the
vile odors arising from it are very obnoxious.
We also wish to call your attention to the
vncant blocks in our neighborhood between
Fifth and Seventh streets and Linden and
Adeline streets. These blocks are being made
a dumping ground for garbage. Can these
dump piles be removed and the practice
stopped?
Hut the pond and the garbage are not only
very unsightly, but they are also a constant
menace to the health of over 500 school chil
dren, as well as a menace to the health ol the
community and the town.

WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TAXING THE BENEVOLENCES?
California, According to Rev. F. D. Bovard, Has Had a Fair
Opportunity of Deciding the Question.
A grent many people are under the impression that California has taxed her benevo
lences from, the first. I have in my possession a written opinion from one of the strong law
firms in Sau Francisco to that effect A writer iv the Overland Monthly for March, 1896,
seems to labor under that impression.
It is true that the constitution of 1850 upon the face of the document included 'â¢all
property" under taxation, but it was considered so manifestly contrary to the spirit of the
Constitutional Convention that the Legislature of 1853 passed a revenue act by which
educational and church property was exempted from taxation. Chief Justice Murray In
1854 says: "The power of the Legislature to exempt the property of religious and elee*
mosynary corporations has not been doubted." (People vs. Coleman, 4 Cal. 46.)
In 1857 the revenue act was amended and the provision exempting the property of re
ligious and educational institutions was continued. (Stats. 1857, Sec. 2.) Concerning these
acts of the Legislature Chief Justice Norton, in 1863, alter quoting the above paragraph
from Chief Justice Murray, says; "We think they are, forreason given in this case, acorrect
interpretation of the constitution, and theomission to tax a portion of the land in the State
does not render the revenue act of 1857 void." (High vs. Snoemaker, 22 Cal. 363.) These
opinions are cited not because we approve them but to show that public opinion was
strong enough to sustain the Legislature, and the highest courts of the State were not will
ing to face the universal feeling of every State in the Union, although the letter of the law
was plain, and render a decision whereby properly used exclusively for charitable, educa
tional and church purposes should be taxed.
It wai not until 1868, after many abuses had crept into the system of legislation, that
charitable institutions were taxed. Chief Justice Khodes overruled the former decision of
the Supreme Court. In the course or that decision he admits that injustice and hardship
would fall upon the churches and eleemosynary institutions. (People vs. McCreery, 34
CaL 432.) The Assessors' records will show that tne minimum valuation was assessed
againat all such property from 1868 to 1880, because it was generally understood that the
benevolent institutions of the State were victims of an unintentional injustice.
The original mistake was on the part of the Legislature of 1853 in not submitting en
amendment to the constitution instead of attempting to construe its meaning contrary to
the plain letter of the document. Any legislative enactment that apparently strains the
constitution, though plainly in accord with justice, weakens reverence for law. From 1876
to 1884 might be called the dynasty of demagogy. A wild spirit of excitement and discon
tent not only passed over the face of California society, but entered into the very blood of
the people like a contagion and broke out in violence, which 6very Callfornian would
gladly forget. It was when this feeling of discontent had reached its highest mark; when
the tongue oi the demagogue was most abusive, when it seemed almost impossible to do
anytning in a cool, impartial ana judicial manner, that the members of the Constitutional
Convention were iramiug the constitution.
Notwithstanding over forty petitions from nearly every county in the State asking for
the exemption of property used exclusively for charitable, educational and church pur
poses from taxation, and only one petition and that from a local organization in San Fran
cisco, which protested against the "recognition of the Christian's Qod and His so-called
revelation and the exemption of church property" in the new constitution, yot such was
the pressure and excitement 6^ the day that the voice of religion and morality could not
be heard and every charitable and benevolent institution in the State, even free libraries
and free museums, were lea to struggle under the burden of taxation.
I was glad to read Bishop Montgomery's words of approval recently published in The
Call, but I want to assure him that the records will not bear out his suspicion that the
Methodist Episcopal church is i^any degree responsible for the insertion of the taxation
clause. In 1887 the president of oneoi the Methodist Episcopal colleges in this State wrotea
very strong pamphlet against, the taxation of church and college property and in company
with some of the leading ministers of the denomination went to Sacrameu to and pleaded
the cause before the Legislative committee, and so far as I know had the unanimous sup
port of his denomination.
My contention is that California had no intention of taxing her benevolences under
the old constitution. There was no State in the Union where the missionary and pioneer
preacher met with such a warm welcome as in California. The first Methodist church
building in Sacramento was taken from the shipâ having been shipped around the Hornâ
and put in its place and made fit for services in one week from the day it landed, mostly by
the hands of those who were not members of the church, and that same kindly spirit every
where prevailed. I think I have clearly shown that the real cause of this attitude of Cali
fornia toward her private charities in taxing them is not the result of any properly tested
policy of the State, but in the wild tumult oi those unhappy days when the new constitu
tion was adopted, when the true statesmen had all they could do to fight perilous and des
perate measures and many other unsifted matters this burden was still left upon the
churches and educational institutions.
It Beems to us that the only fair way to settle the matterâ and in fact that the time has
fully arrivedâ is to submit an amendment to the constitution and let the people declare by
vote whether it iÂ« their desire to tax property used exclusively for charitable, educational
and church purposes. F> D Bovard
BUTTERS AS A LECTURER
The South African Mining Ex
pert Talks to Berkeley
Students.
He Says There Is More Opportunity
for a Mining Expert E sewhere
Than in America-
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. B.â Charles
Butters, the mining expert who has just
returned from South Africa, where he has
been engaged in extensive mining opera
tions on the Rand for the past ten years,
delivered a lecture to the students in the
department of mines at the State Univer
sity this afternoon. Butters' graduated
from the mining department of the uni
versity in 1879, and after a brief period of
experience on this coast went to Africa,
where within a few years he accumulated
upward of $1,000,000 through mining and
commercial industries. He said that a
young man, in order to make a living at
mining, must have faith in himself and a
knowledge of bis profession.
"Tbe held is limitless," said he, "and
mining engineers are wanted to-day as
they were never wanted before. To be a
successful engineer it is necessary to be a
specialist, either in metallurgy or me
chanics. Now is your time for develop
ment. The effect of ihe association with
great minds, such as are in t.ie university,
will make an entirely different man of
you.
"In this country a lucky few own the
mines. It is different in Europe. There
large corporations own tbe mines, and in
order to carry them on successfully com
petent men, and many of them, have to
be employed. There you are placed in
authority by men of means, but of no
mining education, while in this country
it la different to a great extent. But little
confidence is placed in college educated
minim: men in this country, as compared
with the European countries."
The speaker then gave his hearers some
what of a technical review of various pro
cesses of gold mining, drawing from his
experience in Atrican gold-fields.
Opposed to Tree-Planting.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. B.â Contrary
to the general expectation, the proposition
to plant trees along the streets of Berkeley,
which was brought up before the Floral
Society last evening, met with strenuoui
opposition on the part of several promi
nent residents and property-owners. Con
sequenily, a debate lasting two hours or
more was precipitated. Professor Carl C.
Plehn of the State University, Rev. H. H.
Dobbins and Attorney J. M. Whitworth
led the opposition.
Professor Piehn objected particularly to
the tree-planting act as not being legally
justifiable, and declared that the growth
of many trees would materially impair
the healthfulness of the town.
Atter a period of cross-firing two resolu
tions were adopted. The first of these was
that the planting of trees "is beneficial
and desirable for the town ot Bertceley,"
and the second that "the town of Berkeley
comes under the provisions of the plant
ing act."

The Bay Horse Broke Down
in the Last Race at
Ingleside.
Satsuma the Oaly Winning Fav
orite During the Afternoon's
Sport
Ladies' Day Mirred by FOS and Rain.
Reddington Made a Costly Mis
take in the Hurdle Event.
Rain and foe combined contributed to
making ladies' day at Ingleside yesterday
about the most disagreeable afternoon yet
passed by race-goers at the local track.
The inclemency of the weather, though,
did not deter a large number of the
fair sex from attending, for the grand
stand was well tilled.
The muddy going again played havoc
with the favorites, Satsuma, a mild choice
in the first race, beinp; the only one on
which the regulars cashed. Several warm
stable tips went astray, and tbe book
makers trudged off for home light in
heat and heavy in sack at the conclusion
of the sport.
In all probability the racing days of the
great mudlark. Bright Phoebus, owned by
Walter Hobart, are over. The big bay
was associated in tbe final race ovar a mile
â with a most ordinary lot of company and
naturally was a prohibitive 1 to 5 choice.
On account of fop little could be seen of
the horses until the paddock was reached,
when it was observed Bachelor, an 8 to 1
phot, wa- leading the favorite, who
seemed to be swerving and in difficulties.
The outsider won by nearly a length, and
as the horses returned to the &tand the
cause of the defeat was made apparent.
Bright Phconus had broken down and the
race undoubtedly marks his retirement.
For the opening six-furlong dash Dr.
Rowell's chestnut horse Saisuma was
touted as the proper thing, and, going to
The post a 9 to 5 favorite, he won handily
in m Two Cheers, a 7 to 1 shot, ridden by
Bpencer.
Tod Sloan had the mount on Moylan in
the next event, also at six furlongs, and
the Corrisan entry carried the bulk of the
coin at odds of" 6 too. Off well he fell
back and was unable to again get to the
front. Yemen, with 99 pounds up and 6
to I in the betting, led Caliente, the second
choice, out two lengths at the wire. Sport
McAllister was, as usual, inside the money.
BJoan again had the lee up on another
favorite in the seven-furlong handicap.
Although giving away weight Geyser, with
108 pounds un, ha-t lirst call in the ring at
oddÂ« of 6to 5. The colt was away none
too well and ncv.-r was a dangerou3 -factor
during the running. David, the 13 to 5
second choice, bad the race well in hand
at the paddock when McHueh stopped
riding to look wise, and Schiller, coming
fast, snatched the pnrse by a shurt end.
Wawona was an indifferent third.
An unfortunate stumble wbile taking
the last obstacle lost the mile and a fur
long hurdle event for the 3to 5 favorite,
Keddington, ridden by George Ccctiran.
The bay horse looked a sure winner to the
last jump, which he struck and upset.
Tuis enabled Tuxedo, the third choice, to
take the lead, and he downed the favorite
by five lengths, with t'i Fi a good third.
The winner of the three-and-a-half lur
long scramble for two-year-olds turned up
in Aluminum, a chestnut gelding carry-
Ing the Spreckels colors. He went to the
post J8 to 5 and passed the wire two
lengths in advance of George Lee. The 2
to 1 favorite, On Gua Nita, finished out
side of the coin.

About three forlones now seems to b as
far as William Pinkerton appears capable
of carrying his old-time burst ol speed.
The cause is laid to catarrhal fever.
While being galloped on the inside track
prior to his race, Moylan fell with his ex
ercise boy and this shnfceup may hare
contributed to his defeat.

CUBANS SEEK
THE MAYOR
Colonel Ethan Allen of
New York Addresses
Him on Liberty.
PHELAN TO BE INVITED
TO AID.
Jones and Mascherini Will Call
on the City's Chief 0 ficer
at Once.
LOCAL PATRIOTS ACCORDED
RECOGNITION.
The National League Reaches Out to
Crystallize Sentiment in San
Francisco.
There is joy at the headquarters of the
Cuban sympathizers. L'OOtj Mason street,
for word has at last come from New York
tfcat the aid proffered by Messrs. Mas
cberini and Jones, and their many follow
er?, will be accepted.
General Palma has been too busy to
answer the telegrams and letters sent to
him by the enterprising friends of Cuba
here, but Colonel Ethan Allen, president
of the Cuban League of the United States,
sent them a letter which has inspired re
newed efforts on behalf of the struggling
Cubans.
"General Palma depends largely on our
league in this work," runs Colonel Allen's
letter, and continues thus: "Before re
ceiving your letter we had written to the
Mayor of San Francisco, asking him to
apDoint a committee to organize a Cuban
league in your City. We would be pleased
if you would call upon him at once, tell
him the progress you have made, co
operate with him so that he can give to
what you have done the added strength
of his influence."
Messrs. Jones and Mascnerini will call
on Mayor Phelan to-day and endeavor to !
tret him to act in conjunction with the |
National League. The foilowing are the i
vice-presidents of the National League: I
Hon. Charles A. Dana, Hon. Cbanncey M.
l>epew, lion. Roswell P. FiOwer. Hon.
Thomas F. Gilroy, Hon. George Hoadly,
J. Edward Simmons Esq., Hon. Thomas ;
L. James, Hon. Theodore Roosevelt. John '
R. Dos Passos Esq., Charles H. Denison
Esq.
The following constitute the executive
committee: Hon. Paul Dana, Colonel '
John Jacob Astor, General Daniel Butter- i
field, John D. Kelley, Frank B. Carpenter, \
Hon. Jonn C. McGuire, EL C. Alexander,
Colonel Frederick D. Grant, Ervin Ward
man, Constaut A. Andrews, Hon. Waller '
Â£. Logan, Thomas E. Stewart.
The address which the league desires
Mayor Phelan to aid in circulating states j
that the object of the league is "10 secure i
for Cuba by all lawful, peaceful and hon- j
orable means the political independence ;
which her patriots are now endeavoring,
by tremendous sacrifice of treasuie and
life, to gain; to encourage them by our;
sympathy and moral support and to ;
arouse the whole Nation to demand the
end of the campaign of murder and de- ;
struction in that island.'"
DENTAL STUDENTS' TEIOKS.
Secretary Holbrook totnplaing of Them
as a Source of Annoyance.
A Society for the Prevention of Dental
Students. How does that 3ound?
Secretary Holbrook of the Society for
the Prevention oi Cruelty to Animals is
convinced that there is pressing need of
such an institution. The boys are accused
of breaking out again as they did last
year, and the avenger is again ou their
trail.
Holbrook was obliged to â write the re
gents of the university last year and com
plain of the students' tricks. This time
he has communicated with the agents of
the Donobue building.
A lease of three rooms on the third floor
was recently granted the college. On the
same floor the office of the society is situ
ated. Since that time Holbrook states the
boys have acted in a manner totally unbe
fitting gentlemen, and that their presence
js especially intolerable to ladies.
The agents are told tfcat the boys are
generally boisterous and undignified, and
the agents of the building are requested
either to. give the college rooms on some
other floor or cancel the leafe altogether.

AN AWFUL SORE
A Babe's Untold Suffering
And Mother's Many
Sleepless Nights.
CUTICURA WORKS WONDERS.
I herewith write out in full the beginning
and end of that terrible disease, Eczema,
which caused my babe untold suffering, and
myself many sleepless nights.
My baby was born seemingly a fair, healthy
child, but when she was three weeks old a
â welling appeared on the back of her head, and
in course of time broke. Every one called it
a boil, and, now it had broken, would soon heal,
but that was only the beginning of the trouble.
It did not heal but grew worse, and the sore
spread from the size of a dime to that of a dol-
lar. I used all kinds of remedies that I could
think of but nothing seemed to help, in fact
it grew worse, her hair fell out where the sore
was and I feared it would never grow again.
â¢ It continued until my aged father came on a
visit, and when he saw the baby he told me
" to get Ccticcba Soap and Ccticcka oint-
ment right away." To please him I did so,
and to my surprise, by their use the sore be-
. gan to heal over, the hair grew over it, and
to-day she has a nice bead of hair, her skin
is as fair as a lily, and she has no scar left to
recall that awful sore.
CtrriccÃA soothes and allays all itching and
burning that cause a child to fret and the
mother to worry, and gives rest and comfort
both to parent and child.

VAN NESS TO BE
AN IDEAL DRIVE
A Progressive Spirit Being
Manifested in the
Northwest.
Large Sums of Money Expended
in Beautifying the Boulevard
and Adjacent Streets.
A Prospective View of the Future
Importance cf This Section by
Pres dent Law.
The promoters of the extension of Van
Ness avenue from Broadway 10 the waters
cf the bay are more than satisfied with the
result of the large sura of money expended ;
in cutting, grading- and bitutninizing that '
portion of the boulevard.
The Van Ness Avenue Improvement
Club was among the iirst organised In th s
City having for its object the better pav
ing nf the streets, as also urging the Su- j
pervisors to declare tnat avenue a boule
vard In connection with Golden Gate j
aveuue. Having accomplished so much, j
it proceeded stili further, and by soliciting j
the military authorities at Fort Mason
obtained their co-operation in d promise
to open up a roadway through the reÂ«er- i
vation from its junction with Lombard :
street to a western point where a contin ua- j
tion of the roadway will lead directly into j
the grounds of the Presidio, and thence |
into Golden Gate Park by the way of First
avenue. This was intended to give the
still further advantage of tapping the
water front at Bay street, and thus open
ing up a more convenient route to the
business portions of the City over which
heavy nauling can be done without en
croacnine; on the Van Ness avenue boule
vard ordinance.
This partly completed and contemplated
line of improvements has* led to the cut
ting through of the "hog's back 1 ' on Polk
street, on which the work has already
begun.
The amount of $70,000 has already been
expended on the improvements on Van
Ness avenue, and there remains $90,000 to
be expended on the ctttinz, grading and
paving of Polk street. There will be a
further expenditure of $8000 in bringing
I-iombard street into connection with Van
Ness avenue at a point joining the Govern
ment reservation at Fort Mason. This
outlay of $li;S,GOO distributed among labor
ing men has given employment to those
probably in need besides enhancing the
value of properly in that section of .the
City.
The originators of the Van Ness avenue
improvements were the property-owners
on the northern end, who, with the co-op
eration of all the residents on that avenue,
assisted in securing the boulevard or
dinance.
The officers of the club are: Herbert E,
Law, president; P. Ghirardelli, vice-presi
dent; John AlcGovern, secretary; Vai
fcchrnidt, treasurer; with Dr. Hartland
Law, Dr. Alexander Warner, Dr. Ghirar
delli and W. M. Pierson as an executive
committee.
The future of tbis section of the City as
forecast t>y President H. E. Law is ex
pressed by tiim in an interview witii a
Call representative yesterday. He said:
Last Week decided the future of one of the
most desirable movements that has occurred
iri the last twenty years in the northern sec- I
tion of the City, viz.: The removal of Polk
sireet hill. It has had many stumbling blocks j
and notably the direct objection of ex-.Super- j
visor Denrnan, re presenting the Polk-sireet j
Improvement Club, who protested it at-!
last Thursday's ine<tiii(? of the board. The i
obstructions have finally proven unavailing I
aid this work assured. This has been of the
greatest detriment to this end of our City by
reason of preventing any outlet. That the
hill is now to be graded is due to the splendid
efforts of the Van Ness Avenue Improvement
Club, on whose petition and by whose efforts
this work was started ana finally brought to
a successful termination.
It will be remembered that one year ago
Van Ness avenue was bitiunimzcd for seven
blocki, a result of the efforts of this organiza
tion. The Supervisors, Miter the luilest inves
tigation and personal review, have granted
the petition for bituminiziriK Lombard
boulevard from Van Ness avenue to the I'rc
hidio, m us making one of the finest drives the
City nas. This insures a boulevard bystem of
over three miles and provides the nucleus of
the granuest driveway of this future great
City.
There now remain but two blocks on Van
Ness avenue to be opened, which will give
access to the water front and provide out- of
the most beautiiul views in the entire City.
The Government has agreed to terrace Fort
Mason, a park of sixty acres, to the Van Ness
boulevard grade and to provide serpentine
drives skirting the water front. This gives to
the City this beautiiul park at no expense, the
maintenance thereof being borne by the
Government- If this same rate of improve
ment continues for the next five years San !
Francisco will have made a progress propor- 1
tionatcly equal to tbe great city of Chicago. '
11 this spirit can be inculcated in one district
it can be inculcated in every district.
Development of the City and commercial
strength go band in hand. The one needful
element to accomplish this is to secure earnest
activity on the part of the business men, and
especially the rising generation, who have
much greater examples and opportunities
than was the case with their fathers, who
pioneered the establishment of this City.
When we stop for a moment to reflect over the
grand possibilities of this most maguificent
City, situated on the great ocean, capable of
enormous traflic, blessed by one of the best
harbors in the world, provided with a climate
unsurpassed and backed up by a State capable
of producing almost every product and in
ereat abundance, we have before us a future
which it is reasonable to assert is not con
ceived even by the mustenthu*iastlc. No suc
cess ot busincba or of a city ever comes by

chance; it is the result of effort, and we can
hope and calculate with certainty of the
Juiure, providing we accomnany the calcula
tions with corresponding effort. Everything
is possible to us. We can do what we will.

UNCLE SAM'S HARD KICK
General Forsyth Says the City
Has Not Lived lo Its
Agreement.
Requests That Conditions on Which
Fart of the Pres id o Was Ceded
B? Faifi led.
Brigadier-iGeneral Forsyth of the United
States army, commanding the depart
ment, has called to the attention of the
Mayor the conditions under which the
Government of the United States relin
quished certain lands at the I'r sidio to
the City and County, He shows that the
conditions have been violated, and he
takes the occasion to read to the City
authorities a lecture about the con
dition of certain streets and to ask
that something shall be done. The
communication, which was received yes
terday by Mayor Phelan, is in part a3 fol
lows:
I have the honor to invite your attention to
the condition of the City streets on the east
ern borders of the l'residio reservHtton. By
the act of Congress Hpprovud May 9, 1876. cer
tain land* belonging to the I'resulio military
reservation were relinquished to the City and
County <>] San Franeifeu, provided that Lyon
street, as indicated in this act, shall be ex
tended to the hay of San Francisco, 80 feet
wide and dedicated for a public highway lor
ever.
Provided further that Broadway, VaUeJo,
Green, Union, Filbert, Greenwich, Lombard,
Chestnut, FranciÃco, Buy, North Point. Jeffer
son, Tonquin and Lewis streets, as laid down
on the official map of the City and County of
Sim Francisco, be extended westerly to inter
sect the easterly line ot Lyon street and dedi
cated as public streets and highways forever.
Accordingly, in the year 1870, the line on the
easterly line oi the reservation was removed
from its tnen location and placed in its proper
line further west, where it now is.
Lyon street has not yet been opened by the
City authorities, as provided by the net above
referred to. It is ob-truct"d at the north end
by several buildings, lences and a shooting
gallery. Neither have Green, Chestnut, TVn
qiiiu and Lewis streets beÂ«n opened, as pro
vided in the act. Tuesu streets are all ob
structed. t
Before the lhte Senator Fair commenced to
fill his property fU the east of the Presidio
Reservation the natural outlet of the slough
on the north side of the reservation was east
wardly across Lyon and Baker streets. Baker
street and the property east of it has been
filled in by the property-owners. TheGovern
maut is now tilling the marsh on the north
east of the reservation, but the elevation of
the surface after the tilling is completed wih
be lower than that east of Baker street. There
will be lett a depression between Baker street
and the east side of the reservation in which
water may collect, and it may overflow ou to
the reservation.
The Baker-street sewer has been filled upÂ»
with sand for a distance -above us outlet, and
instead of having the obstruction removed,
the City authorities have constructed v box*
drain at the crossing ol Baker and Francisco
streets, which furnishes an outlet for the sew
age into the depression referred to.
In view of these facts I request. that you do
mettie kindness, it it be within your power,
to cause such measures to be taken as will re
sult in the opening of the streets referred to
and in the grades on Lyon street being re
established, south of Filbert street, in such
manner as will make both Lyon street and
the reservation accessible along the eniire
eastern part of the reservation, and in Lyou
â treet being graded.
It is especially important that the portion of
Lyon street, north of Lombard, sliall be
opened, and that the box drain which now
forms the outlet for the Baker-street sower
shall be removed and the tewÃge uirected in
its proper channel, which is along Balser
street; as it now constitutes a menace to the
health ot the neighborhood, and, when the
drill plain on the reservation, which is now
being graded near this vicinity, shall be com
pleted and used by the troops lor drill pur
pose", the dnnger to the health of the troops
will be largely increased.

Fortunes.
SHE TRACKED MEIGGS TO
CALLAO.
One of the Most Romantic Char
acters in Early San Fran
cisco History.
WAS ALMOST ONE HUNDRED
YEARS OLD.
Her Savings as a Washerwoman En
abled H r to Die Wealthy at
That Advanced Ag_-.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 3.â One of the
most interesting women known years ago
to the whole Western coust died at her
residence in East Oakland to-night. She
Is Mitt Julia Kpaulding, who only lacked
three years of completing a century of'iife.
She is known to early Caiifornians as the
woman who followed Honest Harry
Meicrgs to Mexico in 1855 and succeeded in
recovering from him all the money she
had loaned l.im witu interest and ex
penses.
In 1850 Harry Meiggs was in the hey
day of his power in San Francisco. He
was building wharves and halls and was
known to the young city as "Honest
Harry." Confidence in him was unlim
ited and everybody held his notes.
Among those from whom Meipgs bor
rowed all their earnings was Miss Julia
Spaulding. In W>l she was a washer
woman on Sieuari street and had been
all her life a hard-working industrious
woman. Those were the days when a
laundry bill was about equal to a week's
salary at ihi? time. Miss Spaulding had
implicit confidence in Meiggs and readily
loaned him all her savings of a lifetime in
return for his note. One night in 1855
Meigg> disappeared. He had busied him
fcelf lor several days borrowing ail the
money he could cet and when the bark
America hove up her anchor and sailed
for Cullao Henry Meiggs and his victims'
money were aboard. Just before leaving
he borrowed the last installment from
Miss S i>a v Id ing.
l^oiiie lime later Miss Spaulding learned
that, Meiggs was coining a vast fortune in
Peru and she decided to go and try to re
cover her money. She was looked upin
as toolish, as she was then 58 years of age,
but she was not to be turned from her pur
pose.
She persuaded Captain Wakeman of San
Antonioâ now Enst Oaklandâ to take her
as a passenger to Cailao. Ho was only
going to call there for order?, so he could
no. wait to hear the resultof Miss Spauld
ing's mission.
The iadv soon found "Honest Harry's"
casa and discovered that he was rapidly
adding to ti is richet. He received Ins old
washerwoman with open arms and pro
vided her with sumptuous quarters, and
without hesitation he refunded her the
amount of her notes with interest and also
pa;d the expense of her voyage.
Miss Bpaulding relumed to California,
but never admitted to any one ihatshe had
met with suen marked success, this having
been suggested to her by Meiggs, who did
not want to see too many friends at his
Peruvian caÂ«a.
Miss Spauhling, however, commenced
to make some valuable investments and
suspicion was aroused and Meiggs received
many visits. He finally paid every cent
he owed and a bill was passed by the Cali
fornia Legislature according him im
munity from all criminal proceedings be
cause of his actions of 1855. All those who
benefited by the trip lo Peru used to
admit that but for Mi-s Spaulding's ven
turesome journey and discovery th.it
Meigcs was rich "they would never have
received a cent.
Miss Spaulding never married and it is
not known whether any relatives reside
here or not. She has live>l in one of her
own houses at Eighth avenue and East
Seventeenth street for several years and it
was there she died.

MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Modjeska Revives Her Old
Success in " Mary
Stuart."
Bertha Fo z Applauded in "A Legal
Tangle" at the Alca
zar.
The rain did not prevent a large audi
ence from attending the Baldwin last
night to see Modjeska's second perform
ance of "Mary Stuart."
This play has revived the Polish ac
tress' glory more than auything she has
riven this season, and the audience again
showed its' appreciation by frequent ap
plause.
This evening Modjeska will play her
first San Francisco success, "Adrienne
Lecouvreur," for the first time in eight
year*. On Friday evening and at the
matinee on Saturday "Mary Stuart" will
be repeated tor the last times. "Mac
beth" will close the engagement on
Saturday night.
On Monday Louis James, supported by
his own company, will open a season at
the Baldwin.
There ar* only a few more days of "The
Prodigal Father" at the Columbia Thea
ter. Or. Monday "Cnimmie Fndden,"
with Charles Hoppc- in the title role, will
be the attraction. fck> gre.it was the suc
cess of this piece in New York that it run
all last winter and only ended its engage
ment when the hot weather came in June.
Several members of the Alcazar com
pany are a little under the weather in tne
matter of colds, but such afflictions are to
be expected at this season. The perform
ances of "A Legal Wreck" are going very
smoothly otherwise. May Buckley is still
ill, buther part is being very acceptably
tilled by Miss Bertha Folz, who in the
role of Olive Gray is thoroughly natural
and effective.
Next week William Gilette's comedy,
"Ttie ProfeÃSOr," will be played at the
Alcazar.
The excitement of the stock board and
the enthusiasm incident to ''playing the
races" and following baseball continue to
pervade Morosco'3 .Grand Onera-house in
"The Westerner." This play has its last
perlormance on Sunday night. On Mon
day* evening a new melodrama, with a
strong dash of comedy, will be given its
hist production at the Grand.
"Aladdin," with its many specialties, is
filling the Tivoli. Some of the attractive
features that are nightly encored are the
dance of the six little tailors, the electric
uance of the flowers anl Ferris Hartman's
a real ballet, in which he is assisted by
Master Robinson disguised as a youthful
Sandow. Hart raan and his little collab
orator also provoke plenty of laughter by
bobbing up serenely in unexpected parts
of the auditorium and sinking "Miss
Maria Johnson's Going to Marry Me."
What with the Hungarian orchestra and
the Tenor Guille the Orpheum is well pro
vided with good music this week. The
ballets are announced as drawing to the
end of their engagement.
Interest is growing in the Trebelli con
cert, which takes place at the California
Theater next Tuesday. The sale of seats
commences this morning. Gustav Hin
rich's symphony orchestra will ass st
Trebelli. who will sing the Cavativa from
"Semiramicle," the Salome air from Mas
sevei's "Herodiade" and several other
grand arias.
The first Hinrichs-Beel symphony con
cert of the season of 1597 will take place
this afternoon at the Columbia Theater.

WHALERS FITTING
FOR THE NORTH
Barks and Steamers Towed
From Their Winter
Quarters.
Wind-Jammers Ready to Sail
and Steamers Being Over
hauled.
Three Stowawiys Discovered on the
Bark C D. Bryant From
Honolulu
The whalers are getting ready for next
season's cruise. The bark Andrew Hicks
sailed for the southern seas yesterday and
the Horatio will probably follow her to
day. The most interesting scene on the
water front yesterday was the towing of
steam whalers oat of the mud Hats near
the Arctic Oil Works. Yesterday the
Thrasher, Balaena and Narwhal were all
hard and fast and the tugs Sea Witch and
Liberty were sent to take them to the
Union Iron Worns. All three vessels are
steam whalers and will require a general
overhauling before they can sail for the
Arctic. The three steamers were In ttie
mud alongside tne old-time coaster Ajax,
and they made a pretty picture aa they
gradually moved out of the mud in tow oi
the tugs.
The steam whaler Karlut is also going
into commission in a lew days and Cap
tain McGregor wili arrive from the East
to-morrow to take command of her. Tiie
captain's home is here and his children
are at school in Oakland, so he is anxious
to get back to the coast. He and his wife
have bepn on a visit to their old homes
and their old friends in New Bedford,
Mass.
The fastest trip of the season from Hono
lulu to San Francisco has been niaue by
the brig W. G. Irwin. She made the run
in eleven days, beating the C. D. Bryant
by at least seventy-live Hours. While the
trip ia a very ."mart one for this time of
the year, nevertheless it doos not be^'in to
compare with the record of the J. D.
Spreckels, which is nine and a half days.
Captain Lee, on the bark C. D. Bryant,
had considerable trouble during the voy
age from Hawaii. When the vessel was
well under way turee stowaways were dis
covered. Two of them refuted to work,
and were put in irons, while tne third
worked like a Trojan, and was finally
rated as an A. B. on the ship's books.
The men were deserters irom the Ameri
can ship Henry B. Hyde, and 3hipped in
this port for a trip to New York via Hon
olulu. On the lirst oyportucily they de
serted and Jeft the captain in the lurch.
The two men whom Captain Lee put in
irons were William Conroy and Gus
Lurulquist.
The schooner S. Danielson, wnich got
in yesterday, nad a very rough experi
ence during the recentsouiheaster. When
forty miles west-southwest of Mendocino
City a violent squall struck the vessel,
and tbe wave* carried the entire deck load
overboard. The railing of the schooner
was also carried away, but otherwise no
damage was done.
The ship Big Bonanza is potting a thor
ouj:n overhauling on the Oakland ways.
New timbers have been put in and she
will be caulked and recoppered and when
she again appears in the bay will be
as good as new. From here the Bi^ Bo
nanza will go to Pnget Sound in ballast to
load lumber for Australia. Captain Alec
Bergman will go out as master, having
bought out the interest of hia brother,
Captain Adoiph Bergman.
lne Hags of the steam schooner North
Fork and bark Coiusu and all thÂ« other
vessels of the Simpson line were at half
mast yesterday. The wile of James Ty
son, general manager of the concern, died
at her home in Alameda yesterday. Her
husband is one of the best-known mana
geis of steam and sailing vessels on the
water front and when the news of the
death of his wife became public all the
coasters in port flew their flags at half
mast. Mr. and Mrs. Tyson had only been
jnarried about twelve months, so her
death strikes the husband with double
force.
The schooner Norma has been pat on
the line for Tahiti. So much cargo has
been offering that there is an overflow
from the City of Papeete, the maiiboat,
ana the Norma will be loaded to the gun
wales with what 13 left.
The bark Colusa will be an addition to
the fleet that will load lumber for Aus
tralia. She has been overhauled ami will
leave for the Sound nÂ»xt Sunday to load
lumber for Sydney, N. S. \V.
"What has become of the schooner
Vine?" is the general inquiry along the
Iront. Six months ago slie left nere tor a
cruise amone the South Sea Islands. On
September 16 last sue was in Corinto, Cen
tral America, and from that day to this
she has never been heard from. The J. F.
Cunningham Company, agents of the ves
sel, are very anxious for btfr safety. Tne
chances are, however, that some news of
the schooner will arrive on thÂ« steamer
City of Peking, due here from Cfcina to
morrow. ,
The American ship Sterling, seventy
four days from Newcastle, N. S. W., gotin
yesterday. The captain reports contrary
winds and heavy weather throughout the
entire trip. The Swanhilda was seven ty
oue days making the run and the Olive
bank is out seventy-six days. No fast
voyages have been made from Australia

CALVARY WILL
MOVE WESTWARD
The Corporation Empowers
the Trustees to Go
Ahead.
They Have Decided on North
west Corner of Fillmore
and Jackson.
A Blanket Mortgage Will Be Put On
the Old Powell-Street
Site.
Calvary Presbyterian Church will lo
cate ou the northwest corner of Fillmore
ana Jackson streets. This change was
finally decided on at a meeting of the
church niember3 last nigbt.
At the conclusion of the evening ex
ercise the Rev. Dr. John Heniphili briefly
outlined the status of the property about
to be purchased lor the church. At a
previous meeting of the congregation it
was decided to purchase 100 feet fronting
on Jackson street and 89 feet 4)^' inches
on Fillmore, belonging to the estate o!
the late Eme'.ine Wallace, at $33,000, sub
ject, however, to a mortgage of $28,000,
also 25x125:4^ on the line of Jackson
street from Ida V. Butler for $7500.
The question beiore the meeting last
night and the one that caused considera
ble discussion was the purchase of 27x100
feet on the north line of Fiilmore, adjoin
ing thn Wallace property and owned by
M. J. Cameron, for $8000, which would
give for the new church a site 125 feet
square.
On this latter lot there are two tenement
dwellings, paying a good rental. Besides
there are buildings on all of the property,
the rental of which will pay the interest
on the mortgage, but it will take from
$1000 to $1500 to make necessary repairs
on the houses in order to make them hab
itable.
There was some discussion on the meth
od of securing the twenty-seven feet on
Filliuore street and how to raise tne
money to pay for it and to provide for the
floating debt of the present church. Some
of the memoers were adverse to taking a
mortgage on the property on Powell and
Geary streets, while others thought that
the elders could give their individual
notes for the amount necessary lor this
proposition.
Dr. Hemphill and Thomas Magee vol
unteered to become responsible, but this
did not seem to be the way out. Then
anally Dr. Hemphill offered a motion, as
a substitute for the whole, that the con
gregation authorize the board of trustees
and the elders oi toe church to use their
best judgment in providing sufficient
money with which the twenty-seven feet
on Fiilmore street is to be purchased and
also to lift the mortgaee off the Wallace
estate by placing a blanket mortgage on
the present church property. This sub
stitute went through on a run, with only
one dissenting vote.
