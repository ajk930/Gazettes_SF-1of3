PRESIDENT McKINLEY PAYS A
RINGING TRIBUTE.
Instead of Mourning There Is Rejoicing of
Nation in the Memory and
Example of One of the Greatest
Soldiers in History.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 27.â T0 do honor to the man who led
the Nation's armies thirty years ago, when defeat meant the dismem
berment of the Nation, the Nation's soldiers and sailors of to-day, and
those ready to be her soldiers and sailors to-morrow should the neces
sity ;ome, united to-day in one of the most imposing pageants ever
seen in this city.
The President and Vice-President of the United States, the Gov
ernors of many States and other men high in office witnessed the
formal transfer to the city of the stately tomb its citizens have built
for General Grant. Representatives of the most powerful foreign
nations came from Washington in official pomp to honor, in behalf of
their countries, our great captain in his grave.
In the river, which the tomb looks down upon, the powerful fight
ing ships of our navy, the warships of other navies and many other
craft, brilliant with flags and banners, floated, while for many hours
the steady tramp of the foot soldiers passing the reviewing stand was
interrupted only by the beat of horses' hoofs and the rumbling of
artillery. The widow of the dead commander, with her children and
grandchildren, viewed the pageant from the tomb where his re
mains lie.
It was in no sense a ceremony of mourning, though in a certain
sense it was a second funeral ceremony. It was rather the rejoicing of
the Nation in the memory and example of one of the greatest soldiers
in history. In that spirit the city was brave with flags and bunting.
Crowds beyond the powers of the city's means of transportation filled
the streets and vied in friendly rivalry for the best places to see the
spectacle. Only a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands were
able to hear the exercises at the tomb in the morning, but they were
indeed unfortunate who could no! find some place from which to view
one of the most brilliant parades ever seen here.
Uncounted multitudes assembled about the tomb and along Riverside
Drive, where they Witnessed the display both by land and water. A
nobler theater could not well be found for a spectacle so fine. It is not be
yond the mark to say a million people saw the spectacle. Half the city
seemed to be there, and the city was multitudinous besides with her
neighbors and strangers, so the throng was a spectacle also.
PLENTY OF SPECTATORS.

partially, but tn*t me ins of getting to
them were sadly lacking.
Ths West Side elevated roads were sim
piy congested during the morning, and
there was one hour when an ajule mnn
could have traveled over the cable-car
roois from the City Hall Park to Fifty
third street without ever touching foot to
th*Â» pavement.
Fora holiday the city was extremely
busy. When all those who had some
thing to sellâ buttons or badeeF, or pic
tures or sonesters, or frankfurters, or
tickets to Â»tands, or toy balloons, or soap
boxes to stand on, or programmes of the
performance, or any one of a few thousand
other thingsâ advertised their wares
vociferously, there was no lack of back
ground for the martial racket of the day.
It couldn't have been a worse day, from a
speculator's standpoint, barring a cyclone.
There was wind cold enough to take the
comforting warmth out of a flask of
whisky and piercing enough to penetrate
ihe fl:isk. It made life on the unpro
tected stand a gamble against pneumonia,
grip and kindred ills, with odds on the
UN. i
Notwithstanding these discomforts, the
spectators, once there, clang to their
places, hats and any other movable prop
erty which they wished to preserve.
Every time a particularly fierce gust came
considerable personal property changed
hands, the general trend of trade being
invariably with the wind.
There never was a more joyous looking
lot of people on a summer picnic than
those who tat in the big stand opposite
the President, ana on their own hook
sang patriotic songs to keei> the soldiers in
marching time when the band wasn't
playing.
It is computed that there were 60,000
men in the line of the land parade, and
the procession took six hour-" and fifteen
minutes to pass tiie dismissal point. At
the end there was a rnichty retreat, the
common enemy (cold) making itself feit
again. The soldiers joined the civilians
in the rout. The city's highways were
filled with nurrying infantry and scurry
ing cavalry, making what haste it might
to get inside a warm room.
AgaiM streets were gay with color*, but
this time in flecks and streaks, instead of
masses. There was another mighty block
ado tif traffic, and it tool:, besides the cus
tomary nickel, great energy and tirele s
patience to get anywhere on the surface

AT THE TOMB OF GRANT.
Impressive Services Include Sink
ing: by a Thousand Voices and
the President's Address.
NKW YORK, N. V., April 27â The I
"Star-spancled Banner" marked the be
ginning and end of the cpremonies at the
mmb. At sunrise the largest American ''
flae ever unlurlei, 86x50 feet, was hoisted i
on a pole at the tomb. Seven hours later,
when the Mayor had accepted the monu
ment for Greater Now York from the
Monument Association a thousand voices
led by 100 musicians sang the National
anthem. Though the ceremonies began
at 11 o'clock, not half the seats on the
stands were then occupied.
The speakers' ?tand from which the
Pramdent was to speak was adorned with
1200 American beauty rose?. The low
fence of pine boa.ds which separated the
President's party and distinguished
euests from ttio main assembly at the
front of the tomb was shrouded with royal
purple cloth, over which hung continuous
wreaths of laurel leaves.
A beating wind whistled through the leaf
less elms west of the tomb on the banks of
tiie Hudson. The river was muddy and
rutrlod, and the warships, decorated with
the flags of all nations, rose and fell at
anchorage. The clouds overhead were
alternately white and leaden, but peeoine
through was the clearest blue sky and the
brightest ran New York has had in many
days. Spectators arrived slowly, the id en
wearing heavy overcoats, while the women
were enveloped in fur wraps and spring
bonnets. Just In front of the speakers'
stand was a. little army of newspaper cor
respondents reprpsenting ail nations.
Soon after 11 o'clock, by scemiDgly pre
concerted arrangements, thousands upon
thousands rushtU in to lake seats. Tuey
were just in time, as the boomintr guns on
the warships announced the President
had arrived. Up from the river, amid the
booming of Runs, came the strains of
"The Star-spangled Banner" from one of
the warships.
Squadron A, with prancins horses and
â¢â abers drawn, came rushing along amid
great cheer?. Mayor Stront:, escorting
President McKinley, came down the aisle
to the speakers' s;and. followed by the
Vkx-Pfakl eat and Cabinet. Tue Presi
dent repeatedly iilted his hat in recogni
tion of cheers, and the wind made his
hair stand on end.
In a moment ex-President Cleveland
joined the Pr. sidential party. He ac
knowledged a cheer and then shook Mc-
Kinley's and Paunceiote's hands, bowing
low to the latter.
Mrs. Grant, escorted by her son. Fred
erick, and followed by all the members of
her iamilv, was shown to seats in iront of
Mrs. McKlnier. The President turned to
Cleveland and said laujrliincly : "It's a
irood diiy lor spepKing," to wiiich Cleve
land replied, "Yes, if you speak witn the
wind; don't speak against it."
Bisiiop Newman, who was at Grant's
deathbed, was scheduled to deliver the
prayer. Just before the ceremonies
opened the Bishop was asked by Presi
dent McKinley if he hadn't better abbre
viate, but the latter shook his bead.
Nevertheless Newman cut the prayer to
only a lew words, following with the
Lord's prayer, while all the men in the
great assembly aiood uncovered in the
Oiling blast.
After a thousand voices had sung the
National anthem President McKinley was
introduced amid great cheers. The Presi
dent removed his bat as he stood up to
speak, and a score yelled "Put on your
hat." The President shook his head and
used his si.k hat to bang the speaker's
deirk to punctuate the points of his speech.

nant. His iiair was tossed and tumbled
by the wind. His coat was tightly but
toned. All through the speech he was in
terrupted by applause, and when he Had

the Vice-President and Cleveland shook
his hand in congratulation. The Presi
dent said :
"Fellow-citizens: A great life dedicated

providence he was called upon to do,
clothed with almost limitless power, he

powerless to swerve him from the path of

arbitration of differences was the best

After "My Country, 'Tis of Thee." by
t lie great chorus of a thousand voices, the
Mayor introduced General Porter, -aying:
"The present president of the Grant Mon
ument Association, who raised the money
to build this monument." The new Era
bassador to France received a hearty wel
come and creparatory to making a speech
took off his hat. The crowd yelled:
"Keep on your hat. We want you in
Paris." Porter thrust his hat back upon
his head and said: "Thank you for the
suggestion."
General Porter sketched the rise and
prosress of the movement which had cul
minated in the erection of the memorial
and gave samo financial and other stat
istics.
So blustery was the weather during the
oration that Governor Black and bis pri
vate and military secretaries left the

GRAND MILITARY PARADE.
Veterans, Regulars, Mllltla and j
Cadets Join in Making a Most
Impressive Spectacle.
NEW YORK, H. V., April 11. -The
military parade started at 10:30 o'clock
from Madison square in a cloud oi dust,
which harasseJ it throughout the lonu
mar"eh nortnward to the tomb. From the I
top of Ninety-nrat-stieet Lill on Riverside j
drive lh3 first idea was obtained of the j
crowd's macnit'ide. Stretching into the j
Hollow and up hill beyond was a vast sea :
of faces. Away off at the top of tbe sec- j
ond hill beyond stood the tomb, and the j
grand stands there could just he seen biack |
with people. The greeting of this assem
bly was thunderous. It bejran when the I
wiiite plumes of the Thirteenth Regiment ,
band were sighted. It swept down and
over the hill beyond and back again. In
two minutes acres tnd acres of people
were ail standing, waving tlags, hats, i
handkerchiefs and yelling and screeching )
as ii their luncs would si>lit. They did
not quiet down until the paraders were
right among them.
Wnen the line mounted the last hill, on
top of which is the tomb, at 12:40 o'clock,
as the President was at lunch a twenty
minute halt was ordered. Then the line i
re newed its march alon^ the west drive
north to One Hundred and Twenty- j
seventh street, thence around and down
along the east side of the tomb past the
reviewing-stand.
With tiie grand marshal. General Gran
viile Dodge, rode General Broorue in j
Hawaiian uniform, the first ever worn in ,
tliij country. Chief Joseph of the Nez j
Perccs and Buffalo Bill Cody.
At the head of the military grand
division rode -Major-General Wesley Mer
riu, followed by General William Graham,
commanding the first division of United
Stales forces. To ihe West Point Cadets
was given the honor of being thefiistin
line. Liberal applause greeted them as j
they marched past the stand with beauti- '
ful precision of a machine, but without ;
the easy, confident swing of the service- 1
trained regulars who came just after.
There was a battalion of engineers, then a i
rcciment of regulars. Next came a regi
ment of artiilery. Then the light artil
lery was followed by the famous Sixth ;
Cavalry of Indian fighting fame. Follow- j
ing the regulars came the marines and '
teamen.
The militia brigades followed. As the j
f<e o::i brigade came up the band played
"Dixie," and the rebel yell sounded be- â

a hundred spectators. During the gap in I

NEW YORK, N. V., April J7.-Never \
was the American flag carried by filter
siap-5 than the war fleet participating in
the naval parade to-day. Just opposite
the tomb lay the cruiser New York, and !
astern lay the big black Talbot with the â 
white ensign of the English navy at taff
rail ai.d Oid Glory at the fore truck.
Tugging at the cables still further astern
lay the yellow ensigned Infanta Isabeile
and the >farie Theresa of the BpanUh
navy. No iess conspicuous in their deco
rations were these than the others, while
the Fulton, with the tri-coior of France,
and the Italian Dogali, that, in the order
named, completed the line, were as hand
some, if smaller, than all the rest.
fco stretched the line adjoining the New
York shore. Outside there v.as another
column composed exclusively of Uncle
Sam's shipsâ the Maine, Texas, Raleigh,
Columbia and monitors Amphitrita and
Terror. Lighthouse and excursion fleets
gayly decorated began to form in line
early in the afternoon.
Shortly before 5 o'clock President Mc-
Kiniey was escorted aboard the launch
and carried to the dispatch-boat Dolphin,
amid the mighty shouts of the crowd.
While the whole fleet belched forth the
President's salute, the Dolphin steamed
down between the long lines of warships.
An hour later the President had landed at
Fifty-second street, the President's flag
was hauled down from the Dolphin and
the parting Presidential salute marked

EVENING RECEPTION.
President McKlnley's Busy Day
Closed by Fitting: Honors
and a Banquet.
SEW YORK. N. V.. April 27.-From
the time President McKinley left the
Windsor Hotel at 0 o'clock in the morn
is.;; until he returned at half-past H, be
â was the recipient of an extremely cordial
welcome irom the crowds that swarmed
along the seven miles or more of streeis,
from the throngs about the tomb, and
irom the crowded decks of tugs and ex
cursion boats. His d.iy was busy and
trying, but he seemed brighter and more
animated when he returned to the hotel
than when he leit it.
At 9 o'clock to-nicht General Porter es
corted him to the Union L?ague Clnb for
the day's closing ceremony. Many of
those at the Union League in the after
noon saw a long table beautifully decor
ated, at which the President and friends
were to dine. It contained a confection
.model of the White House and Capitol
with the figures of the President and
Vice- President.
But when the time came for the guests
to be escorted to the dining-room, the
beautifully decorated table was missing.
In its placa W6re several tables la rj;o
enough for only four persons. The whis
pered explanation was that somebody had
a row over whether the English Embassa
dor should sit at the President's right.
To settle the dispute the big table was
hastily removed.
The reception was a most impres-ive
affair. Rarely has such a distinguished
company been gathered together, and
never has the Union League Club at
tempted anything so elaborate. The
decorations of bannsrs, flags and plants
were profuse, brilliantly showing the gold
and blue uniforms of army and navy offi
cers and diplomatic corps. A huge crowd,
anxious to see the President, surg?d to the
clubhouse doors. The police drove them
to the opposite side of the street, from
which they could just catch a climpse of
the people as they lelt the carriages. De
termined to bestow applause where due,
tt.e crowd cheered each carriage.
A bind whicii escorted somebody to the
clubhouse was obliged to bang around
outside until after the reception, so the
crowd induced it to play "Hail to the
Chtol" each time a carriage le:t guests at
the door. The police finally quelled the
band and the crowd. The band played
"Hail to the Chief" as tne President en
tered, leaning on the arm of General
Porter. Close behind came Vice-President
Hobart, with Embassador Pauncefote and
Mr. Depew.
The line behind them was very long.
Each guest was accompanied by a mem
ber ot the club. Among them, besides the
Presidential party, which included the
Cabinet and diplomatic corps, were: Gen
erals Schoneld, Howard, Miles, Meiritt aim
Dodge. Rear- Admirals Brown and Bunce,
Speaker Reed, Mayor Strong, Senator
HiniiÃ, Governors Cook of Connecticut,
Lowndes of Maryland, Walcou of Massa
chusetts, Ramsd'.ul of New Hampshire,
Bushnell of Ohio, Hastings of Pennsyl
vania, Lippitt of Rhode Island, Grout of
Vermont and Black of New York, Sen
ators te.vall, Wetmore, Frye, Proctor,
Gallinger, Fairbanks, Waltham, Carter,
Turner and EiKins.
These guests and many others marched
slowly up tne stairs, which were guarded
by a company of the Thirteenth Infantry.
In the larce meeting hail on tbe second
floor the reception was held. Tais room
was decorated with flags of all nations.
In it is a collection of portraits of many
noted generals and most of the President*,
including a new one of Mr. MiKinley by
Theodore Chartran. The walls around
and b.ick of these portraits were hung
with Virginia smilax, relieved in snois by
clusters of red, white and blue (lowers.
Under the portrait of Grant was a wreath
of white roses and violets and above it an
Appomattox flajr which belongs to General
Porter, who as pres.dcnt of the club stood
b?sicte President McKlolty during the
reception and introduced him to the
members. The reception lasted until 11
o"ciock, when the Presidential party went
to supper in an alcove of the dining-room.
The other guests ate in the main dining
room.
THE GRANT FAMILY.
Although Weighted With Yaars. the
Widow cf the Great General
Bcre Up We!!.
NEW YORK, N. V.. April 27- â It was a
long day for the (iraut family, but they
bore the strain well. They were scheduled
to start from the Fifth-avenue Hotel ut 9
a. m., but were all up eariier, and Mrs.
Grarji was holding an informal reception
before breakfast, and for almost an hour
before the lime to start.
Notwithstanding the ueicht of advanc
ing years the widow of the National hero
is active and vivacious. She ate a hearty
breakfast, and shook hands heartily with
most of those who called.
At 9:15 o'clock the whole family tooli
seats in the seven carriages provided for
them. Mr 3. Grant cirae out first, leaning
| upon the arm of her son, Frederick. As
soon as she appeared Squadron A, drawn
up in front of the hotel, saluted.
The whole famiiy was then driven to
the tomb. They were lustily cheered
alone the route. After the dedication
ceremonies ana luncheon Mrs. Grant
viewed the parade until 4 o'clock, then,
fearing the effects of the chilling wind,
leaning upon the arm of her eldest son
and followed by nil the family, she in
spected the interior of the tomb and gazed
| in silence for a moment upon the sarcopha
gus which contains the dust of her illus
trious husband.
Z After dinner Colonel Fred, Ulysses S.
and Jesse Grant attended the Union
League Club function, and the rest of the
famiiy spent a quiet evening at the hotel,
retiring early. They will not leave the
city lor a couple of days.

m
WHY NEW YORK WAS
SELECTED.
Grant Preferred It Because Its
People Had Befriended Him
in His Need.
The ffedioation of the Grant mouumenj
recalls many interesting events in the ca
reer of the greatest American soldier. It
brings again to public notice the early
Btrugi.'l'!s and the many vicissitudes of the
New York Monument Association. There
was a widespread feeling at one time that
the remains of General Grant should re
pose in a crypt of the National Capitol,
but the Grant family, bearing in mind
certain preferences expressed by the hero
while his life was slowly ebbing away at
Mount McGregor, decided to accept, a
proposition made by New York and pace
all that was mona! of the great captain in
a mausoleum on the Hudson. In the
West the hope was expressed that Galena,
111., should be the resting-place of the
man who went from there as a simple cit
izen to perform a patriotic duty, and sub
sequently game i such isme and honor as
fpw men ever achieved. Veterans oi the
Union army, AC many of them in all parts
of the country, hoped that bis remains
might be laid to rest in tue National Cem
etery at Arlington on the banks of toe Po
tomac.
When New York was chosen the public
waited to see if a city so bent on gaining
comme rcial prestige would appreciate the
patriotic honor btstowed and fulfill the
expectation of the country.
A week or two before bis death General
Grant expressed seme views to his sou.
Colonel Freuerick D. Grant, in regard to
bis burial. The disease bad made such
progress that his power of articulation
had almost ceased, and it was only by su
preme effort that he could whisper articu
late words; he therefore used pencil and
paper to communicate with those about
him. When he began to write the general
named Galena, his old home, then paused
and shook bis head. He then wrote West
Point, Out expressed the fear that the
rules Eoverriisig interment there wouid
prevent the burial of Mrs. Grant by his
side. He finally referred lo New York,
wi.ere he had foumi such kina ana de
voted friend?, but added ttiat he wished
no plac- selected where his wile couU not
bo buried by his side. He was apparent, v
attempting to write more when a
paroxysm seized him and the subject was
not renewed.
Here are the memoranda on the subject
left by General Grant for inÂ« guidance of
his family in the selection of his last res 1.
--ing-place:
West Pointâ l prefer this above others, but
for the fact that my v.ife could not be placed
beside me there.
Galena or some other place in IllinoisâBe
cause from that State I received my first gen
eral's commission.
New Yorkâ B-.- cause the people of that city
befriended sne in my need.
As New York was the last place he mi
i dicated a sentiment in favor of that ciiy
| was created. It was accepted as the gac

THE MEMORIAL MEDAL.
the present monument in Riverside Park
was selected.
It is an iaral location for a monumental
tomb, the ground being on the bank of
the Hudson, nt a height of about 100 feet
above the wat*r. It was seen that a monu
ment of suitable proportions would he vis
ible from prominent parts of tne city, from
points many mi c.-> up the river and from
decks of vessels in portions of the harbor.
A temporary tomb of brick masonry
was immediately constructed. The re
mains were brought to New York, receiv
ing marked tributes of ie>pect from offi
cial bodies and masses of the peoi !â¢â¢.
After the body had lain in state at Al
bany, the capital, and at the City Hail,
New York, the funeral took place on Sat
urday, August 8, 1885. The demonstration
as the cortege pass d from the City Hall
to Riverside Park was the most impressive
that the city had ever wit'ies^ed. It is
estimated that the procession was viewed
by more than a million people.
(ieneral Gram's spirit passed away at S
o'clock on ihe morning of July 23. 1885.
On July 28, live dnys later, a meeting of
citizens of New York was called by the
Mayor. A committee was appointed to
begin the movement for a suitable monu
ment to the memory of the illustrious sol
dier. The next day a permanent organi
zation of the committee was effected.
Ex- President Chester A. Arthur was
chosen chairman, la February of ilie
following year the Grant Monument As-
Koclation was organized with Chester A.
Arthur as president. A week later Mr.
Ar hur was stricken with fatal illness and
h resigned and Sidney Dillon whs elected
to succeed him. Up to tuis time the con
tributions received amounted 10 $114,000.
In April, lsÂ«7, Cornelius Vanderbilt be
came president of the association and was
succeeded in February, 1888, by ex- May or
William R. Grace.
Various measures for providing a proper
sepulchre were considered, and competi
tive designs from leading aichitects in
vited. In September, 1890, the plan fur
nished by J. H. Duncan of New York for
a structure to cost between $500,000 and
$<JOO,OOO was accepted.
In due time a contract was made for
i building a foun lation, and on April 27,
j 1801, t.'e anniversary of General Grant's
. birthrtay. ground was broken with appro-
I printe exercises. Comrade Charles H.
Freeman, commander ot the department
of New YorK, Grand Army of the Repub
lic, was the presiding officer. An oration
was delivered by Genera! Horace Porter.
A contract was subsequently made for the
i construction of the lower course of the
granite work, which would bring the

structure to a heighth of ten feet above
the suriace of the ground.
The sum raised up to this time was
about $155 000, and efforts to get more
money seemed lo be unavailing. It
seemed lo the country tiiat the stock of
New York patriotism was exhausted, and
if the Graut monument was to bi com
pleted the people of the whole United
States would have to take hold of the
work. As the fund did not increase the
impression obtained that New York would
fail to give the remains of the illustrious
comrcander of the Union armies a proper
resting-place, so a bili was introduced in
Congress providing for a removal of the
body to the National capital. This pro
po&ed measure aroused the patriotic citi-
zens of New York to a sense of their re
sponsibility. They were also quickened
by the stinging criticism of the press of
other cities. The old soldiers felt that
Grant'? memory had not been respected,
nntl began to cast reproach on the com
mercial metropolis of the Nation. They
thought that seven years was ample time
to finish the work, and refused to conoidcr
the time that bad been taken to build the
Bunker Hill monument at Boston and the
Washington monument at the Natioual
capital.
It was demanded of the city of New
York that her citizens who had sought the
honor of erecting the monument should
carry out the enterprise at once, or aban

don the project. New Yorkers then be
gan to look around for a leader â for a
man of organizing ability to direct af
fairs. AÂ» this period General Horace Por
ter was urged to t.-.ke charge of the affairs
of the association. He was found to be
the man for the work. The monument, as
it stands completed and paid for tc-day,
is a striking tribute to his genius. He
had been General Gram's chief of staff,
nnd he knew New York a3 few soldiers
knew it.
General Porter undertook to raise more
than twice as much money in a few
months as had been secured hy his pre
decessors in years He inaugurated an
eight weeks' financial campaign in honor
of his chief that was characterized by
amazing ability, industry and success.
The movement began March 21, 1892,
and in a few weeks General Porter an
nounced:
An auxiliary committee has been ap
pointed in nearly every branch of busi
ness, trade or profession in the city. The
club?, the churches, the newspapers, co
operated ana the business interests of the
metropolis were carefully organized to
rai c money.
In the final days 215 committees, num
barine 2487 people, were aiding in secur-
ing subscriptions, and when President
Harrison laid the corner-stone on April
27 General Porter announced that in four
weeks $202 800 had been contributed, most
of it lrom Manhattan Island. By Memo
rial day, a munth latter, the total amount
needed had oeen subscribed and a gigan
tic work had been accomplished.
The monument as it Hands to-day rep
resents an expenditure of nearly $600,000.
This came from 00.000 American citizens,
and it includes the widow's mite and the
poor man's modest offerine, as well at the
large subscriptions of the rich.
It is a genuine tribute of tha people, un
like the great monuments of Europe.

York represents the loyai love and patri

AN ORIGINAL CREATION.
The Design of the Tomb Is Digni
fied and Imposing.
The design provided by Architect John
H. Duncan is not a mare copy of a Eu
ropean model, but an original creation,
dignified, imposing, suggestive of the
strength and fortitude of a warrior, and of
the simple force of General Grants char
acter. The general style of the work is
Grecian Doric.
The tomb is massive, yet well relieved
by pillars ana other embellishments. The
eround upon which it rests is 140 fee;
abovu the river, ana tha structure lifts it
self 175 feet in the air.
The exterior of the building isof a light
granite, aud all of the interior is finished
in white marble. The porch is ap
proached by a grand flight of steps sev
enty feet wide.
After a diligent search of seven months
in order to find a granite of light color
which would be entirely flawless and of
duraole quality, a granite singularly well
adopted for the purpose was found in
North Jay, Maine, and this stone was
usea in completing the structure. It is so
light in tone that in strong sunlight it is
hardly distinguishable from marble. One
of the most difficult problems presented
was tne selection of a matorial suitable
for the sarcophagus. About a year ago,
writes General Horace Porter to the Cen
tury Magazine, there was found in the
quarries at Montello, Wisconsin, a por
phyry of fine texture and brilliant led
dish color which famished a sarcophagus
of great beauty and appropriateness. To
comply with tne frequently expressed wish
of Generai Grant th:u his wife should be
laii to rest by his side, a sarcophagus the
exact duplicate of the one desciibed, will
be provided, in which the body of Mrs.
Grant will repose.
The work is entirely completed. The
lower portion of the tomb is a square
structure of the Grecian Doric orJer, meaÃ
urine 90 feet on a side. The entrance is
on the south side, and is protected by a
portico formed of double lines of columns.
The square portion is finished with a cor
nice and parapet at a height from
grave of 72 feet, and above this is a circu
lar cupola 70 feet in diameter of the lonic
order, surmounted with a pyramidal top
termiuatin at a height of 150 feet above
grade, or 280 feet above hieh water of the
Hudson River. The interior is cruciform
in plan, 76 feet at the greatest dimension,
the four corners bein<; pieces of masonry
connected at the top by coffered arches,
the crowns of which are 50 feet from thÂ«
floor level. On these arches rest an open
circular gallery of 40 feet inner diameter,
culminating in a paneled dome 103 feet
abov9 the level of the floor. The surface
between the planes of the faces of the
arches and the circular dome form pen
dentives, which are decorated in highest
relief sculpture by J. Massey K!Â»ind, and
emnlematic of the birth, military and
civic life, and death of General Grant.
The sarcophagi is placed inacryptdi-j
rectly beneath the center of the dome, j
The approach to the crypt is by stair- \
ways, wnich give access to a passage en- j
circling the space dedicated to the sar- j
cophagi, which space is surrounded by I
square columns, supporting paneled mar- j
ble ceilings and entablature. A circular
opening in the main floor gives an unob
strncied view of the sarcophagi from that j
floor and from the gallery, in the work ;
of construction tne builders liau in mind
that strength and enduring qualities were
ot paramount importance; therefore, no
undue haste was made. Occasional delays
occurred from finding specks or flaws
upon the surfaces of some of tlie iarge
stones after they had been dressed down
to completeness; and as the association!
reserved the right under the terms of the j
contract to reject sucu material, new :
stones had to be prepared to take the
placet of those which exhibited defects.
SITE OF THE MONUMENT.
It Is of Surpassing Beauty and Com
mands a Magnificent View.
The site of the monument is one of sur
passing beauty and commands a magnifi
cent view. There is no place in New York
or vicinity better fitted for the location of
such a monument than the one where it
stands. Tue Hudson River flows silently
within a stone's throw. Directly opposite
and across the waters the glorious
Fa!i<ades loom in a grandeur that has
given them world-wide fame. Looking
north tne Hudson may be seen as far as
Tappan Zee. 'lhe immediate surronnd
ings of the monument itself are very
beautiful. To the rear and south are lo
catefa the stately buildings of the new
Columbia University. Adjoining them
will stand, as soon as time and labor
permit, the great cathedral of St. John,
which is to cost $10,000,000. All around is
emerald sward, ami from the background
the monument stands out in eminent re

lief. The locality needs to be seen to be
enjoyed. It is a part of upper and newer
New York. It is near the northern ter
minus of New York's most fashionable
river drive, the daily resort of many people
in carriages. A generation hence the,
Riverside drive will be in the center of â¢'
completely built up residential section.
Fifty years from now it may be the center
of N*w York.
The Riverside drive has enormously in
creased in popularity with the upward
growtn oi the city and the general Intro
dtction of the bicycle, and is rapidly be
coning the fashionable drive. Eleven
years aeo, when the remains of General
Grant were placed in the nastily con
structed temporary tomb, which now
seems a trifle beside the imposing struct
ure of white granite, the Riverside drive
was scaicely known to a tenth of the
people of New York. Now it enjoys a
National reputation. For centuries to
come it is sure to be a shrine of patriotic
devotion.
While the Grait tomb is completed and
dominates the landscape it by no means
realizes the complete ideas of those who
have had it in charge. Five years hence
it will be grander than it is to-day. Elab
orate pieces of brooze statuary are to be
placed along the parapets and the top is
to be graced with a large allegorical group.
The time from the laying of the corner
stone to the completion of the tomb has
been, according to General Hoi ace Por
ter's calculation, five years. A shorter
period than this has been consumed in
the building of no conspicuous memorial
in history. The Kunker Hill monument,
which cost $150,000, was not completed
until seventeen years after the corner
stone was laid, in the case of the Wash
ington monument, which cost $l,l&7,710,
the time consumed was thirty-seven years.
The tomb o? General Grant, dedicated yes
terday, was delivered to the city o: New
York and will be placed in the custody of
the Park Department. S:nc the transfer
of Napoleon's remains from St. Helena to
France and their interim nt in the Hotel
dcs Invnlides no similar function has
equaled in importance and solemnity the
dedication of the 10mb on the Hudson.
REMOVING THE CASKET.
How the Remains Were Trans
ferred to the New Tomb.
On Saturday, April 17, in the presence
of tLree members of the hero's family,
and without pomp or ceremony, the cas
ket containing the body o.f Ulysses S.
Grant, twice President of the United
States and the commanding general of tua
Union armies in the Civil War, was trans
ferred to the beautiful new monument.
Colonel Frederick D. Grant, eldest son
i of t;:e general, whose likeness to the
great chieftain becomes more marked as
the years roll on, superintended the re
j moval. With him were his brother,
â  Ulysses S. Grant Jr., and his son, Ulysses
I S. Grant. The guard of honor which es
â  corted the body of tne great leader from
Mount McGregor to ><ew York twelve
years ago â old, grizzied veterans who
served under Grant â conveyed the re
; mains to the new tomb.
Of tbe original twelve men who served
as the escort in 1835, the following acted
in the same capacity in the transfer: Wil
liam J. McKeivey. Superintendent of Po
lice of Brooklyn ; Senator George W. Bush
of Brooklyn, George F. Tait, Robert F.

enthusiastic meetings were held in the
chief cities and towns of the loyal States.
Among ihose one met in Galena, 111., at
which Grant said: "lam in for the war
and shall stay until this wicked rebellion
is crushed at the cannon's mouth."
In Grant's lirst battle of the war he said :
''Don't lire until you see the enemy, and
then take good aim."
When the Confederate commander pro
posed an armistice at Fort Donelson
Grant wrote: "No terms except an imme
diate and unconditional surrender can be
accepted. I propose to move immediately
upon your works." This message electri
fied the North and made Grant a central
tigure in the group of Union generals.
At Shiloh Grant said to Sherman: "Re
form your ranks and attack the enemy in
front at break of day. It is always an ad
vantage to be the attacking party and we
must fire tne first gun to-morrow morn
ing."
At Vicksburg Grant said to Femberton:
"I demand an unconditional surrender."
Alter the glorious victory at Chattanooga
Grant congratulated bis troops in these
stirring words: "You dislodged him from
Ms great stronghold at Lookout Moun
tain; drove him from Chattanooga Val
ley; wrested from his determined grasp
the possession of Mission Ridge; repelled
with heavy loss to him his repeated as
saults upon Knoxvillo, forcing him to
raise the siege there; driving him at all
points, utterly routed and discomfited,
beyond the limits of the State.
In May, 1861, he said to Sherman:
"Rebel armies are now the strategic po.nts
to strike. In a communication to Meade
he wrote: ''Lee's army wih be your ob
jective point. Wherever Lee's army goes
you will so also."
At the close of the first day's fighting in
the Wilderness, with its heavy losses of
thousands killed, wounded or captured, a
young officer from a distant part of the
hattlelield presented himself, bringing
bad news and. a gloomy countenance to
the chief; but nothinar daunted or dis
heartened the indomitable Grant re
plied: "It's all right, Wilson. We move
forward at 4in the morning. We are go
ing through; there is no doubt about iL"
Later on he wrote the letter to Halleck,
which contained the now famous sentence:
"I propose to ficht it out on this line if it
takes all summer."
In another message he wrote: "The
whole captures since the army started
out sunning will not amount to less than
12,000 and fifty pieces of artillery."
To Lee he said: "Take your horses
home, for you will want them for spring
plowing." Later on he said to the coun
try, "Let us have peace."
MAJOR - GENERAL DODGE.
War Record of the Man Who
Marshaled the Hosts Yes
terday.
Major-General Grenville M. Dodge, the
grand marshal of the Grant procession in
New York, was a distinguished soldier
daring the war, and subsequently a mem
ber of Congress from lowa and chief en
gineer in the construction of the Union
Pacific Railroad. Grant and Sherman bad
a high respect for Dodge's ability as a
tighter and his skill as an engineer.
Dodge organized the Fourth iowa In
fantry, one of the historic regimeuu of
the war, and as colonel conducted it to
the field of battle. At Pea Ridge he gained
a star for gallantry in action. He was
subsequently promoted major-general,
and placed in command of the Sixteenth
Army Corps. As commander of that corps,
in front of Atlanta on July 22, 1864, be
made a splendid record for bravery and
endurance when assaulted in dank and
rear by General Hood. The highest tribute
is paid to Dodge in Sherman's official re
port of this engagement, in which the
brave Mcl'herson, commanding the Army
of the Tennessee, was slain.
ATLANTA'S BANKING PANIC.
A Third Concern Forced to the Wall by

Directors' Meeting.
ATLANTA, Ga., April 27. â Another
institution, hitherto supposed to be one of
the stancbest in the city, has gone to the
wall, a third victim to the defalcation of
Cashier Cassin. An attorney representing
the Washington Loan and Investment
Company to-day secured tbe appointment
of receivers for the concern, the manage
ment of which is clo?ely connected with
the Georgia Loan and Banking Company
and the United States Bond Company.
Tne latter and the Washington Company
conducted a far-reaching installment
bond business, being the depositories of
the sayings of families in nearly every
city of importance in the United States.
The personnel of the board of directors
and stockholders included the leading
capitalists of this State.

directors to-day th* re was a lively row be
tween President G. V. Gress and Judge
R. T. Dorsey, who is Atlanta's foremost
lawyer. Dorsey asserted that he had writ
ten Gress in January asking that he call
a meeting of the directors to examine the
books. Gress replied that he nad just
concluded a personal inspection of tri
bank's affairs and that there was nothing
whatever to warrant the inconvenience
of calling a board meeting. High words
followed until Dorsey in a rage knocked
the president under a table.
An amendment has been filed by Mor
gan Gress, son of the president, to his
original petition which precipitated the
receivership, in which he claims that his
lather obtained large sums of money on
inadequate securities. He also prefers
charges against other officers for employ
ing the funds of the defunct institution
in private ventures. He implicates some
of Atlanta's foremost citizens.

FOUR SURVIVE
THE DISASTER
Terrible Wreck of the
Brigantine Vaillant
on Icebergs.
It Is Believed That Sixty-Nine
Fishermen Met a Fearful
Death.
Four Man Badly Frost- Bitten Picked
Up In a Boatâ They Had Eaten
a Dead Comrade.
ST. JOHNS, N. F., April 27.â The
French barkentine Victor Olgene arrived
at St. Pierre Miquelon bringing survivors
of the brigantine Vaillant, Captain Pierre,
which struck an iceberg on the Grand
Banks on the night of Wednesday, April
14. and sank within twenty minutes.
The survivors believe their sixty-nine
comrades perished. Their ship was nearly
four weeks out from St. Malo, when, -with
out an instant's warning, she struck full
speed against a low-lying iceberg. Her
stem and bows were split to pieces and
tbe hold was speedily flooded. Many of
those aboard were drowned outright by
the inrushing waters or crushed by falling
timbers as they tried to reach the deck.
The ship wa9 en her way from France
to St. Pierre for bait to begin the summer's
codtishing on the banks, and was carrying
fifty fishermen to join the St. Pierre fleet
She had altogether seventy-three persons
aboard. After the collision those who
reached the deck, mostly clad in ni.-ht
robe?, realizing the ship was soon to sink,
wildly began to launch tbe dories. The
boats, being insufficient for all, a brutal
scramble for places in them ensued. The
rescued dory was one of the first to clear
tbe snip.
The survivors are ignorant of now many
others got away, but fear very few, be
cause the ship sank within twenty min
utes, and the screams which accompanied
tier disappearance proved only too clearly
how many were carried down to death.
The rescued dory had seven men aboard
when she left the ship. Only one, Gren
ville, the boatswain, was fully dressed,
and the party pushed off in such haste
that they neglected sails, oars, provisions
or water. For four days they were adrift
in this frail craft, every sea sweeping
over them, drenching them to the skin
ana forcing them to continuous bailing,
until they were too feeble to throw out
any more water, and careless whether
they perished or not they packed them
selves closely along the boat's bottom for
warmth. But the keen frost and the sur
rounding icebergs and floes rendered
warmth impossible, and hunger soon
added its terrors. Qeath cut short tbe
sufferings of two of them on the second
day. A few hours later they sighted the
captain's boat, also without oars, drifting
with half a dozen occupants. She re
ported that one of the party was already
dead, and as none of the rest bad since
been heard of it is believed ail were lost.
The boats soon drifted apart. The next
day Grenvllle's boat lost a third man by
death. Tntit night the famished survi
vors ate the flesh Irom the corpse. 'I he
next evening when the party was rescued
the body was almost half eaten. So rav
enous had they become that Captain Eve
and crew of the Victor Olgene, which res
cued them a week ago yesterday, were
horrified at the sight and sank the body
and boat at once.
The four living men were all bereft of
reason and so exhausted that they had to
be hoisted over the snip's side swathed in
blanket-, their bodies being masses of
frott-bitten flesh. When found they were
all lying unconscious in the bottom with
six inches of water surrounding them and
could not stand or speak for days. When
tney reached St. Pierre to-night they had
to be carried ashore on stretchers. Their
limbs are useless, and amputation is
necessary unon every one. This work was
begun by the doctors to-night. It is an
nounced that three may recover, but the
lourth cannot live. Even if the others
pull through it will be legless and arm
less.
The rescuers could leaÂ»n few details
from the survivors. The Victor Olgene
cruised about two days looking for the
other boats, but failed to see any sign of
them, and it is believed they were crushed
by the ice or swamped by heavy storms
which frequently raced since the day of
the disaster. All hope has been virtually
abandoned of other rescues, though nego
tiations have been opened for a sealing
steamer from here to proceed to the sec
tion of the banks where the ship sank.
AFTER THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC.
Kentucky's Attorney- General Opens His
Suit Against the Big Corporation
at Frankfort.
FRANKFORT, Kt., April 27.â The case
of the Commonwealth of Kentucky against
the Southern Pacific Railroad was called
in the Franklin Circuit Court this even
ing before Judge Cantrell by Attorney-
General Taylor. General Taylor stated
that the case was one involving $136,000
against the Southern Pacific for failure to
report, and damages and penalties; that
the corporation had defied the State au
thorities and had refused to comply with
the law; that the statute in the case
against them was plain; that the attorney
for the Southern Pacific had requested
that it be postponed until Friday, as the?
bad expected to settle by that time; that
they bad made the same promise before
and had failed to do so; that their delays
were based upon the advice of some big
official who was quartered away from the
borne office on a technicality; that the
road had repeatedly shirked in this man
ner before and lie would inform tne court
as to its methods; that he would agree to
the delay to Friday, but no longer; that
they were a foreign corporation, having
their existence from the Kentucky Legis
lature, and were subject to the laws of the
State as other such corporations in the
State and were liable to a franchise tax as
other lite corporations, in addition to the
tax on real property; that the Southern
Pacific was one of the most wealthy cor
porations in the United States; that no
estimate could be placed on their fran
chise by reason of the fact that the com
pany had failed and refused to report, but
that its property couid be estimated from
statistics gathered in the various standard
guides or "statistician-," and that he
would not argue the case further than
this brief statement.
The road will demur to his petition and
argument will be made on the demurrer.
THE KOhESHANITY TROUBLE.
Racy Developments in the Case of Editor
Hoyt Against the Alleged Hypr.o
tizer o fHis Wife.
HAVERHILL. Mass., April 27. â The
famous case of Â£ditor Hoyt of the Bulletin
against Mrs. Dr. Vienna Parsons â mor*
popularly known as the "Koreshanity
Scandal" â was heard before Judge Car'
penter to-day. Startling revelations re
garding this mysterious religion were
made. Mr. Hoyt charges Mrs. Parsons
with hypnotizing his wife and securing
goods on his credit. Mrs. Parsons re
talitates by charging him with improper
relations with a woman noc his wile. Ac
tion for malicious prosecution is now
threatened, as the devotee of Koresnanity
was discharged after making restitution of
the goods in question.
Mrs. Parsons is one of the victims of the
big Koreshauity fiasco in Florida. She
met Dr. Teed of Chicago, the originator
and leader of the new religion, at Mrs.
Hoyt's house, and claims to have given
him $2000, her entire fortune. She then
went to Florida and joined the deluded
colony. Now she has returned penniless,
like lots of other women, all of whom
were more or less wealthy.
Koreshanity ia nothing more nor less
than Dr. Teed. He is head of the church
and took all of the money. Singularly
enough, all of bis flock were women.
He compelled them to take awful vows
o: submission and implicit obedience to
hfm, vows of perpetual poverty, and to
actually worship h:m in ways which
would not bear publicity. Having se
cured all of their money, the worshipful
Teed departed forever, leaving the pov
erty-stricsen converts to beg their way
back to their homes as best they could.
It is said that Teed landed in Boston,
the home of countless other i-ms and
creeds, and is still working on the cred
ulity of some of the wealthy blue-stock
inged women of the modern Athens. Mr.
Hoyt propones to investigate further and
bring about an official expose of the re
ligion in the courts, if possible.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 27.â "0w.
ney, " the famous postal dog, is not dead,
as reported, but in St. Louis at the uonie
of J. Melvin, a postal clerk, who will keep
the dog until he dies. Owney has been
a subject of official correspondence be
tween the Postoffice Department and some
of its officials. When Captain White, gen
eral superintendent of the railway mail
service, read that the doc had been killed
by a policeman in Cleveland for attempt
ing to bite a man he wrote Superintendent
Pepper in Cleveland requesting j>n official
report and asking whether the skin could
be mounted for the postal museum here.
Pepper's response, which was received
to-day, says that the dog mentioned was
not Owney, and that the poiicem,:in killed
an ordinary car. The last heard of Owney
rvas that he had gone to Cincinnati to
meet the new superintendent, from which
point he was "routed" to the exposition
at Nashville.
Postal Clerk Melvin saw the story
about Owney's death a few days a^o and
to-day Captain White received from him.
a letter saying that the dog had been m
Melvin's possession for three weeks. Ha
joined Melvin while returning from the
Postal Clerks' Convention at San Fran

year.-*. He tries to bite everybody ha
doesn't know. Melvin, in his letter, said,
he would like to Keep the dog for the bal

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 27.â N0
action has yet been taken by District At
torney Davis toward enforcing the sen
tence passed upon Elverton Chapman, the
contumacious Sugar Trust witness who
was sentenced to pay a fine of $100 and to
be imprisoned for thirty days. The Dis
trict Attorney has not yet had an oppor
tunity to read the decision of the Supreme
Court denying the petition for release, as
the opinion has not been released by the
court. It is thought that Davis will en
force the sentence and then bring the re
maining defendants â Havemeyer, Sey
mour, Searles, McCartney, Schriver and
Ed wards â to trial. Counsel for these
claim that their cases cannot, be brought
within the terms of the Supreme Court
decision, but the Chapman case has all
along been held to be a teat one, and it is
believed that the President will not grant
an application for pardon.

Edhem Pasha Signifies His

Creek Fleet Sighted Off Salonlca,
Where the Wildest Excite
ment Prevails.
LONDON, EKB., April 27.â The Athens
correspondent of the Daily Mail tele
graphs that he learns from a credible
source that a suspension of hostilities has
been decided upon to enable the Ministers
to reconsider their position. He adds
that the Government has already decided
to withdraw the Greek troops from Crete
and to inroue the powers to extricate it
from its difficulty. The correspondent.
declares this sudden change of front
arises from the fact that Edhem Pasha
has signified his resolve to march upon
Athens.
Advices from Arta are to the effect that
the advance of the Greek army into
Epirus has been suspended.
A Cabinet council was held at the For
eign Office to-day for the purpose of dis
cussing the Eastern question. Salisbury,
who is in attendance upon the Queen in
the Riviera, was virtually present through
the courtesy of the French Government,
which placed at his disposal a private
â wire over which was a constant exchange
of cipher dispatches between the Premier
and the Ministers.
The Standard's Athens correspondent
telegraphs an interview to-day with
Delaynnis. When questioned whether it
â¢was true that the war would be continued
Delyannis said it was the popular decision
that the campaign should be continued,
if by doing so the national honor could
be vindicated. When asked if the Govern-
rr.ent would cease to claim Crete and con
cur in the autonomy of the island under
s European guarantee, Delyannis de
clared thnt this would be contingent npon
Greece obtaining a rectification of the
Thessaiian frontier in accordance with the
treaty of Berhn.
A dispatch to the Daily Telegraph says:
The crisis in the Ministry of Marine arose
from the reception of a telegram from
Kororakis, a naval officer, saying: "Dur
ing the four days the fleet has spent at
Skiathos (at the entrance to the Gulf of
Volo) we have been betrayed." No ex
planation of the dispatch is given, and
there is much conjecture regarding its
meaning.
ATHENB, Geeece, April 27.â Colonel
Bairaktaris, with 2000 re-enforcements, will
sfart for Epirus immediately.
The King bas assembled the Chamber of
Deputies in i xtraordinary session ana re
quested the leaders of tne opposition to
hoid a conference at the palace.
While the opposition leaders were
closeted with the King in the palace this
afternoon large crowds assembled, cryine
"treason." After the conference Scou
loudis, one of the leaden of the opposi
tion, said that all present at the meeting
had agreed that it was the first duty of the
Government to reorganize the army, what
ever should follow.
A semi-official note has been issued to
the newspapers stating that the King has
informed Prime Minister Delyannis that
ha would refrain in future from interfer
ing with the direction of the campaign.
Levides, Minister of Marine, who is dis
satisfied with the course events have
taken and with the adverse comments of
the populace, resigned his office, but the
King brought pre: sure to bear upon him
and he consented to retain his post for
the present.
The situation early this evening, before
the conference adjourned, was extremely
critical, and the fall of the dynasty is
believed to be seriously threatened.
Crowds of excited people are flocking to
the gunmakers, and there is scarcely a
man to be met who is not armed. Mean
while many prominent men of the capital
are frantically exhortin- the people to
remain calm and preserve order, but with
indlffere.it success.
The downfall of the Ministry seems im
minent. Premier Delyennis declared this
afternoon that the Greek Cabinet would
resign if public opinion continued to
demand more from the King, who has
already done all possible to meet the
requests oi the people.
To-day numerous disorderly outbreaks
occurred at PirseuÂ«, where the pÂ°ople in
vaded cafes and smashed portraits of the
King.

A Speedy Termination of the War Would.
CJianae Jilt Proaratntne. â 
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 27â A
JPreas Asiociatiou dispatch, sent from
Washington last Saturday night, stated
that the President had issued orders to
General Miles, commanding the army, to
visit the seat of the Greco-Turkish war.
Ttie Press Association was premature, for
the President has not signed the order
yet, and in view of the speedy termination
of the war may not do bo at all.
Last Sunday's Cali, stated the situation
correctly. General Miles is anxious to go
and Is enthusiastic about it. It may be
that the Secretary of War will send Gen
eral Miles whether the war closes or not,
as the eeneral has expressed a wish to
observe modern military methods in
Europe. If General Milesshould go it is
possible that General Brooks would com
mand the army during his absence.
It lÂ« now conceded mat upon the retire
ment of General Wheaton, in May, Brooks
will be made a major-general. General
Merritt. who is also anxious to observe the
Greco-Turkish war, has ben granted
leav.! tn do so, but in a private capacity.
He is to defray all his own expenses.
WHAT RUSSIA WANTS.
An Interesting ArMclo From a
Sem:-O:f'.clal Organ of the
Czar.
Russia's position in the Creto-Greco-
Turkish situation has puzzlad many, says
the Liter lry Digest. At first she was sus
pec:ed of secret sympatny with Crete and
Greece, but her readiness to resort to coer
cion in the interest of the integrity of the
Sultan's empire has dispelled those euspi
cions. It is believed that she is playing a
waiting name, and \vant9 a greater share
of Turkish territory than immediate dis
solution of the Ottoman empire could
bring her. She is believed to have her eye
on Constantinople. In view of this im
pression, the following editorial from the
<=emi-omcial Novoye Vremya of St. Peters
burg will be read witli interest. That
or^an charges England with duplicity and
bad faith and repels insinuations against
Ruseia. It says:
It Is assumed by many European observers
and politicians that Russia eternally dreams
of occupying Constantinople. In truth,
| Russia's ultimate designs iv the Eastern ques-
I t:on by no means blind her to the immediate
! conti quences of her conduct. To occupy
Constantinople, it is necessary to occupy first
the Bosporus, and this can be done iv one of
these three ways: 1. By force, against the
oonseatof Turkey; 2. with the consent of the
Sultan's Government; and 3, with the con
sent of the powers as well as of the Sultan.
Let us asi, what would become of Constan
tinople in either of these cases? Ofcourse.it
is not always possible to forecast the develop
ment of things, but probability allows us to
make the following suppositions: If we Rus-
I sians should succeed in taking possession of
i the Bosporus by iorce, anarchy would at once
! be inaugurated i:i Constantinople, and the
I Turks would be compelled to emigrate to
j Asia. The signal would be given for appall
j ing massacres and atrocities. At the same
time the various and numerous claimants for
different portions of the Ottoman empire
would hasteu 'o grab the coveted territory.
Turkey would, in fact, be dividedâ but not
; permanently divided. At first the minor gov
i ernir.euts would acquire their slices, and thea
the great pretenders would step in and effect
a second division. What sort of a Constanti
nople would this situation place in our tos
session? The home and storm-center of civil
war and disorder, requiring the expenditure
oi untold treasure and energy in the interest
of pacification. The whole Turkish empire
would be in a state of anarchy and violent
conflict, with the powers quarreling and
threatening each other over the spoils. Does
anyone seriously imagine that Russia Is at
tracted by such a prospect?
To occupy the Bosporus with the consent
of Juriey is an alternative which we un
doubiedly deem the hipiies; solution of the
present difficulty, so full of menace to both
governments. To Russia it wouid mean the
de'.ivery to Russia of the key to her own
house, while to Turkey it wou'd mean secur
ity and safety. The Sultan's authority would
' be confirmed and assured, and he would be
i freed from the danger of malicious and sub
| terranean plotting. An end would be put to
that incredible situation under which the ab
i surd grimaciug of little Greece is sufficient to
threaten the fall of the empire, But, clearly,
this solution wouM not give us Constanti
nople. Onthecontrary.it would perpetuate
and strengthen the rule of Turkey in that
world-metropolis.
There remains, then, the possibility of oc
j cupying the Bosporus with the consent of the
| European powers. Iv the first place, no such
| consent can be expecteil. England, as a con
| sileratlon for her acquiescence, would de
i mand a compensation which Russia could not
| grant her. In the second p'.ace, supposing this
obstacle to be removed, the occupation of tbe
! Bosporus by Russian furues would involve the
| forcing of the Dardanelles by European fleets;
j aud the effect of such startling news on the
subjects of the Sultan can be realized by Rus
sia alone. European diplomacy is at bottom
incaoableof comprehending the Turkish ques
tion. To it the division of that empire pre
sents itself as a rearrangement of the map;
I but we, who as a nation still live more by feel
| ing aud instinct thaa by reasoning and calcu
lation, know that to dismember Tarkey is to
quarter a living Deinsr. If the Sultan should
fail to raise the banner of the Prophet soino
new Madhi would do it and the tanatlcal
i Turks would fight as they have never fonitht
I yet It is idle to think that a bold nnd united
fronton the part of European Governments
would inspire terror in the Mussulmans and
cause them to hesitate and submit. No. at a
critical period of the supremacy of their race
and faith they would be found united, disci
plined%nd determined to resist to the end.
Moreover, we will say frank;y that Russia
would not trust the European powers in that
supremo emergency. We have witnessed the
European occupation of Crete not without
misgirings and this first experiment in the
direction of concerted action has not been al
together reassuring. How would we regard
tho appearance of European fleets before Con
stantinople? We should Inevitably ask what
European interests were Involved and the
answer would be that the fundamental con
cern of Europe was simply to hamj er Russia
and interfere with her success. The integrity
of no other power is really dependant on the
fate of Constantinople, but it U slmpiy a ques
tion of prestige, and Russia must reserve her
right to Insist on the priority and superiority
of her claims. She is willing to co-operate
with Europe, but it must be understood that
she does not abandon her risht to supremacy.
Russia wants peace and the maintenance of
the status quo, and it is aq error to suppose
that she is insincere on account of her designs
with reference to Constantir.ople. But she
wishes one thing understoodâ that in the
event of division her claim on Constantinople
is superior to all other claims, chiefly because
in no fewer than six wars Russia, and no other
power, has crushed out Turkish might, eman
cipated millions of oppressed Christians and
dictated the terms of peace right under ihe
walls of the capital. Tliere waÂ» a time when
some dreamed of removing the capital of the
Russian empire to Constantinople, but they
overlooked the fact that in that city there are
850,000 Turks, Greeks, Armenians and for
eigners. Wo cannot make it our capital, but
it does not folio w thot it belongs to any other
power. Russia alone can solve and decide the
fate of Constantinople.

At Ottumwa, lowa, Six Hundred
Families Are Driven From
Their Homes.
NEW ORLEANS, La., April 27.â The
first break in the lower line of levees oc
curred to-day on the Melrose plantation
at Pinquernine, thirty-nine miles below
New Orleans, on the west bank of the
river. The creva3?e is not large, being
only tifty feet wide, but will do a
deal of harm if left open. Officers of the
La Fourche Levee Board, believing that it
can be closed, began work immediately.
Engineers have made an examination of
the Biggs and Reid crevasses of Mason
Parish, which are close together and part
of the same crevasse. Thoy find that the
two breaks are daily discharging 24,682,
--800.000 cubic feet of water into the Tensas
basin. The water is running through the
Reid ctevasse at the rate of six miles an
hour and through the Biggs break at five
miles an hour.
Officers of the United States relief boats
wnich made trips through the overflowed
parts of Louisiana and .Mississippi report
great destitution in the latter State.
The local levee board to-day borrowed
1100,000 to raise the New Orleans levee.
The La Fourche and Aichaffalaya levee
lines, which have already been raised
once this season two feet, will be raised
another two feet. In the Atchaffalaya
district forty miles of levee will have to be
raised its entire length.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., April 27.-Only twice
within the authentic history of Northern
rivers has the waier been higher than dur
ing the flood which was beginning to .sub
side last week. But Saturday and Sunday
heavy rains fell throughout the central
and northern valleys of the Mississippi,
and all the rivers were again swelled be
yond high-water mark throughout that
region. The Dcs Kotnm River, Upper
Mississippi, MiÂ«souri, Illinois, Platte and.
numberless minor streams have over
spread their already water-soaked valleys,
spreading destruction broadcast. At 8t!
Louis this morning the gauge read 28.6
feet â within a foot of the record.
OTTUMWA, lowa, April 27.-The Dcs
Moines River is still dangerously high,
and the gravest fears are felt for the safety
of the city. Nearly (300 families have been
compelled to move because of the levee
breaks.
Work on the levees before the city has
been progressing since last Friday, but the
sudden rise this morning destroyed a great
part of the labor. Large forces are em
ployed to-night in an endeayor to prevent
further breaks. The suburbs have so far
been the worst sufferers, aside from the
railroads. West Ottumwa, a lar<re resi
dence section, is entirely flooded and the
water is still rising. The inoabitants cling
to their homes, howevbr, hoping that the
worst is over.
Rich farming landsaboveand belowthls
city are inundated. The flood there has
not reached a high stage, but has spread
out in many places to a width of five to
mx mile*. No loss of life has been re
ported, but the damage to property will be
very large.
WARSAW, 111.. April 27.â A break oc
curred in the levee of the Hunt Drainaee
District this morning and from a crevasse
of six feet quickly widened to 100 yarJs
to-nieht. A great volume of water is
pouring into the Hunt and Lima Lake
districts, and 20,000 acres of farm land
will be submerged. There are also thou
sands of bushels of corn cnbbsd in the
district. On the Missouri side the Dcs
Moines River to-day cut through the
Egyptian levee six miles above the river's
mouth and is now flowing across the
country, threatening to cut a new chan
nel to the Mississippi. The latter stream
is now live miles wide at this point.

WASHINGTON. D. C, April 27.â A
special from Cuariottesville, Va., says:
The condition of Colonel John S. Mosby,
who lies ill at the University Infirmary,
due to an accident on Friday in being
thrown from a buggy, seems to have im
proved. The medical attendant in charge
considers that he is decidedly better. He
is conscious and has been discussing his
business affairs this morning. He is suf
fering no rain and there is greater hope
for his recovery than has existed at any
time.
Dr. Hunter McGuire of Richmond came
up and spent the afternoon in consulta
tion with Dr. Hueh T. Neison, the physi
cian in charge. Ether was used to admit
of an examination of the fracture of the
frontal bone, and the result was that the
physicians deeMed that there was no
ne<?d for an operation.
Dr. MiGuire expressed the opinion that
the patient stood about an equal chance
somewhat in favor of recovery, if any
thing.
Colonel Mosby passed a comparatively
easy day yesterday and is resting quietly.
During most of the time since the acci
dent tie has been conscious, but his mind
has appeared to wander at frequent inter
vals. His two sonsâ Beverly 0. Mosby of
Salt Lake City and John S. Mosby Jr. of
Denver, Colo.â have both been wired to
come on, as Colonel Mosby's condition is
not as promising as the family had hoDed
it would be at the present time. The
other members of his family are now
here, and the entire infirmary building
hat Deen turned over to them lor their use
while at the university.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 27.â There
is no doubt in the minds of the treasury
officials charged with the conduct of the
customs revenue service that the new
Canadian tar.ff, with its features preferen
tial to Great Britain, will largely develop
the practice of smuggling British goods
into the United States. Tariff changes in
the United States or Cannda always have
an effect on smuggling.
"It is an inevitable law that an increase
in tariff rate* produces smuggling," said
a treasury < frichil to-day. "Small articles
easily handled will form the bulk of
smuggled wares"
The customs officials say that diamonds,
sealskiru and opium are the principal
things for which they must watch. It is
likely tnat the force of special customs
agents along the frontier will be increased.

MONTEREY. Cal., April 27.â Joseph

has suddenly blossomed into an inventor
o! no mean ability, and his inventions (of
which there are two) seem destined to
be of great benefit to the world at large

an automatic clock rpgulator, and patents
have been anDlied lor in this country,
Canada and Great Britain.
Shulte's oiher invention aIHO relates to
clocks, and is an automatic beater. By it
a pendulum clock will remain in perfect
beat no matter whether it hangs on the
waU, Bt*ods upon a shelf or is tipped to
one side till the ball of the pendulum
strikes the wall or ihe side of the case,
and this resalar . beat is automatically

PETALUMA'S LADY MINSTRELS.
Gratifying Success of the "Imprudent

Cork Art: sis.
PETALUMA, Cal., April 27.â "Coiffure
sans chapeaux" was the rule of the bril
liant house which greeted the ladies of
the "Imprudent Club," as they have
styled themselves for the minstrel season
in their advent into coondom. After the
orchestral overture the curtain roll
ing up disclosed two tiers of ladies in
burnt cork, save the interlocutor, who
was au naiurel, all in remarkably fetching
costumes. That of the six "end-men" was
of brilliant-colored cheese cloth skirts, a
la skirt-dancers, white shirt fronts, choker
collars with lon- pointed ends ana mon
strous pointed cuffs to match, while the
costume of the chorus consisted of white
duck skirts, shirt waist with broad, black,
horizontal strifes and mammoth buttons,
all so suitable and attractive in appear
ance that even the most critical could find
nothing i.nmodest about the garb.
The whole performanca was remarfcablv
good; the local hits told every time and
encores were frequent. The greatest se
crecy wa<Â« observed as to the identity of
the individual performers. All of the
specialties were fine.
Great credit is certainly due to the lady
managers, for the performance went along
as smoothly o.s though the performers
were old hands Â«t the business. After the
performance a large part of the audience
adjourned to Armory Hall, where dancing
was indulged in and the ladies served re
freshments.

One of the Most Dastardly
Crimes Since the War

Capture a Portion of the

HAVANA. Cub\, April 27.â A Spanish
battalion under General Soria has com
mitted one of the most shocking crimes in
Cuba since the beginning of the war. The
Cuban hospital at La Guana Matagua,
province of Matanzas, was attacked last
Friday by the battalion and sixty wounded
and sick men, together with three women
and five children, were slain by the sol
diery. To destroy all proofs of their bar
barity the Spaniards burned the bodies of
their victims *nd the house in which the
hospital was established.
Colonel Hernandez raided the small
town of Nicolas, ten miles from Havana,
Sunday night, capturing four officers and
eighteen privates from the earrison and
killing fourteen. He secured a large
amount of supplies. The Spanish garri
son was drawn out of the fort by false in
formation and the insurgents swept down,
putting them to rout. The blockhouse
was burned.
Of the $15,000,000 which, as reported yes
terday, will be the sum total of revenues
collected in Cuba by the Spanish Govern
ment this year, only $5000 is assigned to
taxes raised in the country districts,
which proves how completely the Span
iards have lost all control over the island
outside of the fortified towns.

Murdered.
MAN HE BEFRIENDED IS
UNDER ARREST.
Ed McCamish Charged With
the Death of the Brave
Constable.
BACK OF THE CRIME IS A TALE
OF LOVE.
The Accused Prisoner Said to Have
Been Enamored of His
Friend's Wife.
VENTURA, Cal., April 27.â The arrest
of Kd McCamish and the developments
which warranted it put a new and sensa
tional face upon the murder of Constable
McCoy Pyle of Castaic Saturday morn- ;
Ing. Very strong evidence indicates that |
McCamish deliberately planned the roar- ;
der of the man who was his best and clos- !
est friend and carried out the plan in j
cold blooi. The theory of the arresting j
officers in regard to the motive is that Mc-
Camish was in love with I'yle's wife. The
odd feature of this story, the theory being
correct, is that Mrs. Pyle enjoys the best
of reputations and is not believed to have
returned the murderer's affection, but on
the contrary to have been thoroughly in
Jove with her husband.
McCamish is in jail in this city. From
extreme self-confident volubility his man
ner has changed to morose suilenness. Con- I
fronted with the evidence that ttie story !
he told of having been sandbagged and j
robbed was false, he declined to mate j
any explanation, nor does he now insist )
upon the truth of his original story of the I
murder of Pyle.
McCoy Pyle wa3 a constable living in
Fillniore. He was awakened early Friday
morning by McCamish, who, apparently
laborinc under excitement, declared be
had been beaten into insensibility by two
men who had broken into his cabin while
he slept; that they had robbed him of his :
clothes and jewelry and made their es
cape. He said the robbers had cut their j
way through a wire screen over his win- j
dow; that in their assault upon him they i
had used a sandbar, and that he had lain
for two hours insensible.
Pyle had made somewhat of a reputa- j
tion as a trjlef-c^tcher and found much I
satisfaction in it. Eacer for an oppor- â 
tunity to add to it he accepted McCam- i
ish's story without suspicion, for he
looked upon the man as his friend. The
two started at once to search for the j
robbers. At McCamish's suggestion they |
role on a train to Sausus, some twentv
five miles south of Fillmore, with the in
tention of waiting the track back toward
that place. That night they camped at
the little box station at Castaic,
According to McCamisb, the killing of
Pyle came about in this way: They had]
arranged that one should stand guard j
while the other slept At about 4 o'clock '
in the morning, while he (McCamisb) was \
on guard, two men came down the track,
both carrying bundles. McCamish awak- |
ened Pyle, and the latter commanded the !
two to throw ud their hands. They did i
6o and McCamish stepped forward and
snapped handcuffs upon one of the men.
At this the other tired and Pyle fell. The
robber fired upon McCamish and then he
and his companion started to run. Mc-
Camish shot four times, and one of the
fleeing roobers, when some distance away,
cried that he was shot, dropped his i
bundles, stopped to pick them up again,
continued running and both made their
escape.
McCamish says he returned to Pyle to
discover that he had been shot ttirough
the eye and killed instantly. He made
his way to ths ranch of John Arnot, about
a half mile away, and gave the alarm.
Twenty-five vaqueros stationed there took
to tne field and began ih* search that con
tinued until Sheriff Chariebois of this
city, upon evidence tuat. he be.ieves war
ranted it, arrested McCnmish himself for
the muruer.
Officers from this county and from Los
Angeles went at once to the scene of the
murder and began a thorough and sysie- I
matic search for evidence. They found the i
tracks of two men about the little station [
box at Castaic. They could find no sign j
of four. The Stone brothers, famous for â 
their knowledge of woodcr..tt, dec'ared i
their inability *.o find the trail of more
than two men. Under Sheriff Andrew
Snodgrass, with Ed Miller and John S
Graham, went to the scene from this
place, interviewed McCamish and re
turned here to impart suspicions that had
been created in their minds to Sheriff j
Charlebois. They could find no mark
upon McCamish of the rougti usage he
had received, according to bis own story,
at the hands of the burglars. They dis
covered that the wire netting over the
window of liis shanty had been cut from
lbÂ«* inside.
Then, too, McCamish was not acting
jusi as ).e imjcht be expected to under the
circumstances. He was accompanied by
& brother of the dead man in his search
for the supposed murderers, and the reck* j
less manner i:i which he traveled tbroach I
the brush caused surprise. His comments j
about the number of crows in tiie sky and '
the height of the alfalfa through which
they passed caused young Pyle to remark !
that he seemed to be giving little thought
to the serious business in which they were
engaged.
AH these things coming to the ears of
Sheriff (Jnarlebois, he went to Fillmore
yesterday. The Coroner's inquest had
been held, the murdered man.* remains
had been buried the day before, his widow
and three children had gone to live with
Mrs. Pyle's mother at Santa Pauia and
the sensation of the hour was quieting
down. McCamish had given some inti
mation of an intention to leave the coun
try. Dally Lindburger engaged him, by
direction of the Sheriff, to look after some
Btock. by way of keeping him in tne
neighborhood, allaying any suspicion he
might have while engaged in the hills
wi;h his new occupation.
The .Sheriff effected an entrance to Me-
Camitb'a cabin and male a thorouch
search of the premises. He had first pro
cured from McCamish a iist of the ar
ticles alleged to hare been stolen from
him. He found hidden away in corners
nearly all of the articles so listed, nmone
ihem a hat, a necktie, a shirt, a pair of
sleeve-buttons, ami, down at the bottom of
a trunk, the handcuffs belonging to Pyle.
which lie had declared the rnbber had
carried away on his wrists. This, to
gether with some information that
seemed to offer a motive for the killing,
deci-Jed the Sheriff upon making the ar
rest. He took John Graham with him.
Tfcey expected t:ie mini in irom the hills
at -io'cock. He usually tied his horse at
a stable in front of an old churcl: on the
I main street at Fillmore. The officers took
a station just Inside the doors of the
| church and waited. McCamish came up
: on the horse, but he did not tie up at the
j church, lut continued down the street. A
I man stepped up to speak to him and he
. stopped.
â¢â¢This is as good a time as any," said
Charlebois, and the two walked out to
where McCamish sat on his horse. Plac
ing his hand on the bridle and pulling his
revolver the Sheriff told him to t^row up
his hands. Instead of doinsr so McCÂ«tniÂ«U
reached for his revolver. The Sheriff put
! his weapon up for action, and called upon
! the fellow to put up his hands quickly.
j He did so and then under orders climbed
i down irom his horse.
In an instant, almost, the street was
crowded with people, who seemed to un
derstand about the circumstances. MO
i Caruish, wearing hanicnft-, was put into
i the Sheriff's bogey, and the otiicers
brought him over the twenty-hvf miles
intervening between this city and bill
more in two hours and a half. He did
not deem it wise to leave the man In r ill
more for the three hours that he would
have to writ for a train, as the old
ranchers, who had been hunting for the
I murderers for several days under Mc
taraish s directions, were already talking
violence. ......
During his long ride McCamish made
no renioTistrance. nor did he ask any ques
tions as to tne cause of his arrest. AS hen
visited to-day at the jail by The Call
correspondent be threw himself upon his
cot, drew a blanket over him, so that even
his face was hidden, and refused flatly to
discuss the subject from any standpoint,
: saying that he would tell his story "at
; the proi)er time." He is a strongly built
young fellow of about i>4, with Hght hair
and eyes and complexion. His dress is
that of a cowboy, with top boots and som
brero.
Under Sheriff Snodgrass said to-day:
[ "The evidence nil indicates that McCam
i isu shot Pyle while the latter was asleep.
I Pyle was a man who could sleep soundly
; under any conditions if he wanted to. He
â  would drop off to sleep in a moment. I
; am convinced that this fellow deliberately
h hi a revolver to his face while he was
insensible and pulled the trigger. The
j face was marked with powder, showing
that the revolver was close to it. Mc-
Camish would never have done it while
Pyle was awake, for Pyle was a brave
man, quick as a flash, while McCamish
has the reputation of being an arrant
coward. Pyle, under the impression that
ho was hunting down the men who had
beaten and robbed McCamish, was led by
the latter to his death."
It is common talk in Fillmore and has
I been for a long time that Ed McCamish
| was deep y in love with Mrs. McCoy Pyle.
j Mr?. Pyle is a remarkably line looking
! young woman of about -A. She is of a
I sunny disposition and admired by every
body. She is equally respected. McCam
ish. however, sought to ingratiate himself
into her favor by every means possible.
All this time Pyle reckoned him am >ng
his friends, and when McCamish became
sick and thÂ»re was no woman in his bach
elor quarters to look after him he had him
brought to his own home. For tv. o
months he lay there, waited upon and
| nursed by Mrs. Pyle. The physic. an who
I was called in was unable to discover what
! ailed the man, or that anything ailed him.
As week alter week went by and he did
j not get well, nor was found to be sick, it
j came to be whispered that he was adopt
i ing this extraordinary mean*, of working
' upon the sympathy of ihe woman he loved.
i McCamish left the PyJe household only
a few weeKs ago to return to his little
J bachelor den, just across the street. He
â  lived in a lutie room back of a cobbler's
i shop, where he "batched." The room is
i rilled witn all sorts of odd* and ends, that
i make it look like a junksbop. lie has
! lived this way for years.
Well buiU, rather good-looking. Me
| Camish has not been a favorite with
j women. It is recalled that some time ago
he was desperately in love with a young
Spanish woman of Fillmore, and pursued
her with attentions, despite her constant
effort to suppress him. From her he turned
to Mrs. Pyle, and if the theory of the offi-
I cers be correct his passion there led him
j under the shadow of the gallows.
The scene of the murder is just three
I miles over the county line, and ail the
! parties to the tragedy belong here. The
1 murderer will be taken to Los Angeles for
trial. The olliceri will take him down on
the morning train.
BERING SEA CONDITIONS.
Dr. Jordan of Stanford University Believes
the Remnant of the Seal Herd
Will Be Protected.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cal., April
27.â Dr. Jordan was seen to-day regarding
the proposed trip to Alaska in connection
with the fur seal?. He expects to leave
early in July and return on August 25.
The two commissions which investigated
the subject last year have not disagreed
as to tne facts of the case, so far as
known. Great Britain asks that the ratio
of decrease should be definitt-ly known,
as a factor in the ultimate settlement.
It is apparent, first, that the fur seal
herd is already practically commercially
ilestroyed both on land and sea. This
has brought with it the ruin of the seal
skin industry. Only especial care of the
herd and the exercise of great business
sagacity can ever restore this business.
The killing of the females is the
oulv element that has entered into the
destruction of the herd. If the Christian
peopie of England and America realized
th<Â» full meaning of pelagic sealing, its
cruelty to noble animal life and its cross
wastefulness, not another schooner would
be allowed to clear from any civilized port
for this unnatural quest.
C. S. Harnlin, late Assistant Secretary of
the Treasury and now special comraissoner
of the treasury, is in consultation with
I> . Jordan and Professor Chirk on the
subject. Both Mr. Hamlin and Dr.
Jordan are confident that ample protec
lion will be eventually accorded the seal
j herds.

FROM PRISON TO
MARRIAGE ALTAR
Arizona Assassin Weds
a Divorcee From San
Francisco.
The Woman Attracted by His
Portrait in the Daily
Papers.
Seeks Out the Murderer and Be
comes His Wife After He
Is Liberated.
STOCKTON, Cal.. April '21.â 0n De
cember 1 last Nashville Franklyn Leslie,
civing his residence a 9 San Carlos, Ariz.,
took out a license in this city to marry
Mrs. Belle Stowell, whose residence was
put down upon the license as Warren
County, I!l. Ho and the woman there
upon sought out Justice Parker and wore
wedded. L?slie told the Justice a roman
tic story, but it was not half as romantic
as the truth would have been. He eaid
that he was an Indian scout, and stated
further that he and his bride were going
to China for a honeymoon trip. He
promised to send the Justice a curiously
wrought cane from the Orient as a me
mento.
Nothing more was heard of the couple
until this forenoon, when a San Francisco
detective walked into the County Clerk's
office and asked to see the stub of the li
cense-book. He then called upon Justice
Parker and the true romance became
known.
Lsslie was an Indian scout, as he repre
sented himself to be, but he came to Stock
ton direci from the Territorial prison in
Yuma County, Arizona. He exchanged
the stripes for a wedding dress. He had
just served eight years for murder. The
detective who was looking up Mr. Leslie's
record uid not remember whether he mur
dered his wife or a man whom he found
with her, but he was under the impression
that it was his wife whom he killed.
At that time the San Francisco papers
published accounts of Leslie's exploits,
and in the biography of the murderer re
produced pictures of him. Mra. Belle
Stowell, who then lived in San Francisco,
and who was the ex-wife of a prominent
man in the employ of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company, read the narrative of
the scout's adventures, and though she
had never seen him she became infatu
ated. She had just been divorced from
her husband, and she began to correspond
with the murderer. Fiowers followed the
letters, ana then fruit was sent. The
murderer reciprocated, or pretended to,
and ihe only hindrance to the marriage
was his incarceration.
Mrs. Stowell obtained a railroad pass
to Yuma, Ariz., from her ex- husband. He
little thought that she was going to join
a murderer upon the latter's release from
prison, but such was her mission. When
Leslie bad served out his time he and bis
briue-to-be came direct to this city, where
the license was obtained and the marriage
toot place.
Mrs. Stowell has been and is still draw
ing $40 monthly alimony from her former
husband. The latter tired of paying her
this sum, and the detective's mission here
was to obtain evidence whereby the order
of alimony might be revoked.
Mrs. Leslie is at present in this Stale,
but it is said that her husband cannot be
located, although it is believed that he
might be in Randsburg. It is not known
whether they have separated or not, but
it is believed that they have.
MARIN ADMINISTRATOR ACCUSED.
Heira of Anne Magolr.ck File Charges
of Fraud Against Dcr.ms
Donohue.
SAN RAFAEL,, Cal., April 27.- Mary
Dacy and Lizzie Thomas have brought
suit in the Superior Court of Marin County
aeainst Dennis Donohue, as administrator
of the estate of Anne Magolrick, deceased.
In the complaint iiled with County Clerk
Thomas Bonneau Monday afternoon, the
plaintiffs make serious charges against
the administrator, alleging that he well
knew that Anne Magoirick left an estate
in California other than a lot with im
provements thereon in Healdsburg, and
that Donohue, for the sole purpose of fraud
ulently and unlawfully imposing upon the
court, falsely alleges and sets forth in his
petition that personal property consist
ing of lUO shares of the cajntal slock of
the Queen Bee Mining Company, 100
shares in the Ameer Mining Company,
aiid ten shares in the Chieftain Gold and
Silver Mining Company were left by the
deceased in the hinieoi California.
The plaintiffs declare that Anne Magol
rick never at any time owned or possessed
any of the snares of Â«tock; that she leit
no shares of stock in tins .State, and that
the sole purpose of Douonue in represent
ing to Judge Angellotti that Anne Magol
rick left the ."hares of mining slock in the
county of Marin was to impose upon the
good faith of the court, and by artifice and
fraud to prevail upon the court to assume
jurisdiction over the settlement of the
estate.
The complaint, after making these
charges against the administrator, sets
forth 'hat the plaintiffs are daughters and
lawful heirs and next of kin of Anne Ma
golrick, otherwise Known as AnneGoldeu,
and are entitled to share in the distribu
tion oi the estate.
It is claimed that Anne Magolriek died
at County Cavan, Ireland, and left no es
tate in California except a lot in llealds
burg. On April 9, 185)6, the administrator
filed a paper purporting to be the last will
of the ueceased, with a petition praying
that the copy of the will be admitted to
probate. On April 27 the will was ad
mitted to probate, and letters of adminis
tration were issued to defendant on April
30. The complaint alleges that no testi
mony was offered in behalf of the petition
other than the testimony of defendant,
wnich was reduced to writing and filed,
bu: defendant has not signed the same,
although requested to do so by the cierk
of the court, and he still refuses to do so.
When the estate proceedings were before
Jvdge Angellolti some time ago Lewis F.
Hyington and Dennis Donahue almo-t
came to blows in the courtroom and were
separated by Donohue's attorney, Jud^e
E. H. Mahon. after they had laiu down
their coats and prepared for hostilities.
There has been considerable fee .ing shown
daring the estate proceedings.

LCVED THE SAME TYPEWRITER.
Two Stockton You'.hs Journey to a Roman-
tic Spot and Lambaste Each
0 her.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 27.â Down to a
romantic spot on the bane of Stockton
channel below the Crown mill, where
Diablo looms in the distance and the sky
to the west is enough to make a poet
versify, and where, by the way, policemen
do not patrolâ down there went two
romantic young men last Friday night.
They were Joseph Moore, a tailor em
ployed at the woolen-mills, and Richard
Tumeliy, a bridge-builder. They walked
thither in sullen silence not because they
were en rapport with the beauty of the
natural scenery but because they were
bent on shedding biood.
The irHilan'. young men bore the very
inimical relation of rivals, and each had
a score or ruore of grievances that he was
det-rmined t> settie with the other in
that picturesque soot, where the blinking
old moon would be the oniy leferee and
the little cattish the only spectaiors. Each
was resolved to lambaste the other until
he madly loved some other girl or hated
the sex so hard that he would die a
bachelor.
A pretty little typewriter who cannot
help oeing charming ana who is equally
unable io help captivating Joseph Moore
and Richard Tumelty was the fair prize
for wnich the valiant lovers Rtood up
acainst each other to be punched. After
t!ie fisht both were so beautifully deco
rated that they looked like circus posters
in tliree colors, and the girl could not be
blami-d now if she would lavish her affec
tions upon a third young man whose eyes
nave not been artificially beautified and
who curries all his facial cuticle around
with him.
No spectators witnessed the battle, and
the declaration of each man that he was
not the loser must be taken ior what it is
worth.
PUYALLUP RESERVATION POLITICS
In'eres'ing Story of Intrigue Back of the
Rzsignation of Agent Ncw
berne.
TACOMA, Wash., April 27.â Dr. R. E.
L. Newberne, who has been in charge of
the Puvallup Indian Reservation near
here for a number of years, has made
public his resignation. Frank lerry of
Montana, at present in charge oi the Crow
Indian Agency, will succeed him.
Back of Dr. Newberne's resignation is
an interesting story. On January 11 of
this year he was promoted to the position
of Superintendent of Indian Schools in
the Northwest. This left the charge of
the Puyailup Reservation vacant, and
Colonei J. J. Anderson, who had shortly
before lost a job as Commissioner of In
dian Lands, applied for the piace.
Hiirli Wallace opposed him, and he did
not get it. Nothing daunted, he applied
for Dr. Ncvberne'a new position, and two
days berore Clevelnnd went out of office
was given the place, and Dr, Newberne
was relegated back to his old position on
the reservation.
Dr. Newbprne would not stand this, and
on Marco 6 tendered his resignation,
which iias now been accepted. The pecul
iarity of the transaction is that Illinois
Democrats who supported the gold stand
ard and General Palmer espoused Ander
son's cause, while Anderson was one of
the hardes: workers in this city in sup
port of Bryan and the iroe-silver move
ment, speaking against the Cleveland ad
ministration ana acting as one of the
Central Committee of the People's party
forces.
Dr. Newberne will go East and enter the
medical service of the Government.
DIES PENNILESS AT PORTLAND.
Fate of a Young Englishman Who Was
a Protege of the Prince
01 Wales.
PORTLAND, Or , April 27.â bidney Old
field, a young Englishman wi o has pa
pers in his possession showing that the
Prince of Wales had defrayed the cent of
his education, died almost penniless at a
hospital here last Sunday.
Oldfield was of a quiet, retired disposi
tion, and, while he was an agreeable young
man, he took no one into his confidence,
except Charles P. McManns, a man past
50. McManus was one of the young man's
chief mourners yesterday.
Mi Manus stated that Oldfield told him
of his young life's history. This lea him
to wonder what possibly could have
brought him to so low an estate as to
linger about the North End. To him the
voting man one evening said that he was
the son of a younger s>on of an English
Earl, but he retrained from mentioning
thÂ«Â» name.
There were five brothers in his family,
all of whom were compelled to learn'a
trade, for which in later years he was
quite grateful. His father and the Prince
of Wale were warm personal friends, al
though the young man's father was a
poor man, so to Bpeak. In view of this
fact, and also in consequence of some
pr<>at personal service Oidfield's father
had rendered the P.-ir.ce, his Royal High
ness defrayed the cost of aducating the
live boys.
McWanus added that this was as far as
his young friend would take him into tiis
confidence, beyond the statement that an
nffair of the heart induced him to leave
England for this country. There had
bren a mutual love between hinvelf and
a girl of noble birth, but as he was poor,
with no prospects, the idea of entertaining
a proposal from him was ridiculed by her
parents.

STRANGE CASE OF
A UKIAH CRIPPLE
Ferdinand W. Browback
Refuses Surgical
Assistance.
Writhing Under the Pain of
Fractured Limbs, He js
Awaiting Death.
Convicted in San Francisco of Send
ing Obscene Matter Through
the Malls.
URIAH, Cal., April 27.â Fenlinand W.
Brow back, the crippled son of a wealthy
resident of this city, whose case when he
was convicted several months ago of sand
ing obscene matter through the mails at
tracted much attention, li dying of his
obstinacy.
BrowbacK and a companion started to
drive to Hopland on Saturday last and
when near Largo Station a passing freight
train frightened ths team and it started to
run. The road is very narrow at this
point, winding around a hillside, and after
running a few yards the maddened horses
dashed over the bank, carrying the vehi
cle with them. Browback's companion
jumped as the wagon went over aud saved
himself, but the unfortunate cripple could
not aid himself and was thrown violently
to the bittom of a small gulch, both ot his
legs b>ing broken and a deep gash cut
in 11 is head.
Browback was conveyed to his father's
handsome home in this place and a phy
sician sent for, but he refused to have the
limbs attended to, saying that he wa
useless to himseif and every one else and
that he might as well die as not. Tue in
jured man paid no attention to the plead
ings of his relatives that he allow the sur
geon to operate upon him. Unless he
changes his mind soon his days are num
bered, for the fractures are bad ones and
gangrene will set in before lon;.'.
Browback has had a strange career. His
family is well supplied with this world's
goods and gave him every opportunity for
advancement. Notwitnstanding this he
left home several years ago and became a
cowboy, a vocation that ne followed for
some time. Finally an accident tnat crip
pled both legs compelled liirn to return
home, and he was a familiar sight about
Ukiah, driving a little go-cart, into which
ne could climb without assistance.
About a year aco a number of com
plaints were received by the United
States postal inspectors of San Francisco
that obscene printed matter was being
sent through the mails and the manufac
turer was finally located in Ukiah. He
proved to be young Browback, who, un
known to his father, was printing thou
sands of vile books in a little printing of
fice that he operated at the home place.
Browback senior supposed that he was
merely printing a few billheads and cards
for friends, for amusement more than any
thing else.
He was arrested by Postal Inspector Er
win while in the act of packing uu for
shipment a large quantity of ob-cene
books. His father would not at first be
lieve in his guilt, and prepared for a stufc
born defense, but the evidence against
him, showing that he was the most ex
tensive manufacturer of obscene literature
in this State, was complete, and when he
came up before the United States District
Court in San Francisco he pleaded guilty
to the charge.
The United States Judge, in considera
tion of his infirmities, let him off with six
mouths in the Mendocino County Jail
and a fine of $500. His father paid the
tine and he was recently released after
serving the sentence of imprisonment
MILL VALLEY'S MAD-DOG SCARE.
V cious Canine Lies in Wait for School
Children and Springs Upon
Them.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., April 27.â There
was considerable excitement at the Mill
Valley Public School to-day when a dog
made an assault upon several children.
Walter Bowering, the young son of F.
Boweripg, who does business in San Fran
cisco and resides in Mill Valley, was bit
ten in the thign and the lad was sent
home, where it was found that the teeth
of the doc had left their impression and
drawn blood.
Young Bowering left the schoolroom at
11:30 o'clock, according to the stories told
by the scholar-, and was In the hallway
of the building when the dog flew at him
and bit him. The animal next attempted
to bite a pupil named George Aukers. The
lad picked up a large rock, and just as the
dog jumped towaid him threw it with
considerable force, striking the brute be
tween the eyes and stunning him.
One of the young sons of ex-Supervisor
Vincent KingwelJ, who attended school
in Mill Valley, also narrowly escaped being
bitten by the dog.
For a short time there was plenty of ex
citement, but the boys finally chased the
animal away from the school grounds.
The matter was brought to the attention
of Justice Fottrell this evening, and the
dog will be located and shot. It is owned
by one of the residents of the mill above
the schoolhouse. The injury received by
the Bowering lad is not serious.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
New York has a right to be proud of that
monument.
The dedication festival was local to New
YorK. but the sentiment which inspired it
was National.
Greece bit off a great deal more taan she
could chew, and now the powers insist
that she shall digest it.
Bland and McMillln are determined the
Democrats ot the country shall know that
Boy Bailey is not leading them.
60 long flÂ« Balboa avenue is incomplete,
so long will it be timely to urge subscrip
tions to the fund for completing it.
There is wit, wisdom and eloquence at
the Woman's Congress, end it will be j
worth anybody's while to attend it.
Now that the metropolis of the East has <
dedicated the long-promised monument
to Grant, it will be quite appropriate to
recognize her as Greater New York.
It is reported that the Spanish Govern- I
ment in Cuba will have to face this year a
deficit of $100,000,000, which looks very
maefa as if Weyler had been running a !
Cleveland administration there.
It is said of a certain Kansas State Sen- >
ator that whenever he saw anything ha .
did not lite he would introduce a biJl j
abolishing it, and he seems to have riis- j
jiked about everything hesaw in the State.
A3 ex-Governor A! t^-Id seems to be
badly mixed un with tue Globe Savings
Bank failure, hi^ political career may be ;
considered cio=ed unless the anarchists
choose to take him up and make the most
of him.
No tributes to the rnernors' of Grant are
more grateful to the Nation than those
which came from the South, since they
afford a proof that \h? magnanimity of the j
hero has awakened the honor and love of
his foes.
Washington City has been clever enough
to set her police to work to take a census |
while the office-seekers are in town, and â¢
as a result lays claim to a population of j
277,483, being an increase of about 5000 I
since 1895.
One advantage was gained by New
York by being slow in the completion of
the Grant monument. She has had Mc-
Kinley for the chief figure of the day in
stead of Cleveland, and that was well !
worth waiting for.
The powers were prompt to interfere J
whÂ«n Greece sent an army to the relief of !
Crete, but they will not interfere when j
Turkey invades Greece, and thus does !
diplomacy redeem itself from the charge j
of being monotonous.
The duties imposed upon President Mc-
Kinley at the dedication of the Grant
monument were undoubtedly fatiguing, j
but as they relieved him for a time from
office-seekers he probably regarded the
occasion as a holiday.
According to a Washington correspond- i
ent the strength of the Maine delegation i
in Congress Is due to the fact that it has
not been changed in fourteen years, but it
WOUid be jun as accurate to say that the
reason it has not b;en changed is because
it was strong to start with.
It is asserted that many of the Kansas
Populists who howled against capital in
the Legislature have gone home with more
money in their pockets than they ever had
before, and as a result neariy every otner
Populist in the Slate has become a strong
advocate of rotation in oflice.
The London 'Awes recently* stated: "In
no case will Turkey be allowed to gather
the frqits of victory over a Christian peo
ple." If that statement expressed the set
tled conviction of the powers it is full
time for them to interfere, for it is now
evident that Tuckey has the longer pole,
and if it is not taken away from her she
will soon have the persimmon.
Shipments of gold to Kurope have be
gun again, but this time they disturb no
body. Business men know that we have
now at Washineton a business adminis
tration, and that within a comparatively
short time we will have a tariff which will
provide a revenue for the country and a
decree of protection which will put an end
to heavy importations, and that then gold
shipments will turn the other way.
It is said at Washington that some of
the petitions for office filed by applicants
for positions are more elaborately pre
pared and decorated than the essay of a
sweet girl graduate. I:i some cases they
are written on vellum, and are engrossed
and illuminated in the most elegant style,
so that the cost can hardly have been less
than JlUOeach. Itreraains, however, now,
as heretofore, that it is not the petition so
much as the plain pull that gets away with
the pie.
It has been suggested that all convicts
in the prisons of the States affected by the
Mississippi floods should be set to work on
the levees and other un<leraki;igs to pre
vent similar Hoods hereafter and the sug
gestion seems to be well received. By the
prooosed plan convicts would not only be
removed from competine with free labor,
but they would assist in makinc the work
of free laborers more remunerative
throughout the whole region subject to
overflow.
THE GRANT MONUMENT.
If any further evidence had been needed tliat the aspiration for a restored union
J of loto and loyalty, South as well as North, which General Grant expressed in his
memorable words, "Let us have peace," has been amply and abundantly realized be
fore the generation which took part in the war has passed away, it was furnished
during the ceremonies which attended the solemn and patriotic dedication of his
mausoleum on Riverside drive yesterday.
The procession, which began the ceremonies and formed the most imposing part
of its brilliant spectacle, was made up of men from ail parts of our common country,
and equaily conspicuous among those most prominent were men of the South as
well as of the North. Nor was it by their presence only that these Southern men
attested their veneration for the memory of the great leader of the Union army.
They uttered words of eulogy so infused with genuine feeling that their sincerity can
not be doubted. These words, widely read, will carry throughout the country the
gratifying conviction that the bitterness of a civil war has passed away even from the
beateu side, and that hereafter the war will be to us a glorious page of history from
which we shall learn lessons of patriotism, free from any feeling of sectional differ
ences or distrust.
What Lord Bacon said of himself, "I leave my fame to foreign nations and to
future ages," might with truth bo said of almost every great man. His countrymen
of his own generation see him too near to comprehend the full outline of the great
I roportions of his character, and are too much involved themselves in the struggles
in which he is engaged to impartially estimate the value of his services or the con
trasted features of his excellencies and his defects.
For that reason final judgment upon Grant cannot be said to havo been yet pro
nounced. We have had eulogiums upon l;im from the ablest orators now living ; from !
personal friends; from profound students of current history, and from ardent I
patriots, who i'eel deeply the vast importance of his services to his country. All these, j
however, have but furnished the facts which are yet to be fused into one perfect whole !
to make the true and rightful character of Grant known to the American people. We !
can be satisfied with the knowledge that when this true record of his life is made
public it will but add praise to praise and Jift our great general and ereat .President
higher yet in the esteem of the world.
The mausoleum which has been raised to him on that noble site of the principal
city of our country is one of the greatest and most beautiful structures ever dedicated
to such a purpose. It takes rank among the great tombs of the world, and worthily
manifests by its imposing architecture the esteem in which the present generation of
Americans hold the memory of their greatest general. Its impressive beauty will
never fail to awaken in the minds of all who see it a remembrance of the loyalty and
patriotism of the great man whose body lies entombed within it, and it will be a
mecca for patriotic pilgrimages for all time to come.
New York may well be proud of the patriotism which she has displayed in erect
ing such a monument and the Nation at large will be gratified with this evidence that
the people of the metropolis are not so wholly given over to commerce or so tubject
to the influence of European fashions and society as to be indifferent to ths noblest
sentiments of patriotism or lacking in the fervor of a spirit that is thoroughly
Americaa.
THE WHEELMEN'S DUTY.
The suggestion made by The Call some
time a?o that the wheelmen of San Fran
cisco should come to the front ami take an
active part in raising money lor the com
pletion of Balboa avenue has met with a
response sufficiently favorable to encour
age the hope of good results in the imme
diate future. Several wheelmen have
shown a willingness to take the leadership
in a movement to interest all the bicycle
clubs in the work, and there can be no
doubt they will receive a cordial support
from their fellow cyclists.
To assist in the work of constructing tbe
avenue and to taue a leading and prom
inent part in raising the money necessary
to complete it is a duty which the w'aeel
men owe to themselves and to the City.
The proposed avenue will be largely
for their benefit. They will de
rive more pleasure from it, perhaps,
than any o.her class of citizens.
It i=, therefore, with justice and reason
that the peop'e of the City look to
the wheelmen to bear a share of the
cost of constructing the road and to per
form a laree partof the task of raising the
required money.
Where many men are engaged in an
undertaking of this character not much
will be required of any one person if all
do their share. The number of wheel
men in San Francisco is so large that if
each would contribute but a very small
sum of money the amount now needed to
put the avenue into good condition
throughout its extent would be very small.
If, therefore, the bicycle clubs take up the
subject vigorously they would not have to
ask heavy contributions from their mem
bers in order to make a good showing of
civic patriotism by raising a sum which
would assure the completion of the work
oa the avenue without delay.
The work that has been thus far done in
promoting the enterprise has been in the
highest degree gratifying. The contribu
tions of money have been prompt and
liberal, and have come from sources suffi
ciently widespread to attest that the in
terest taken in tue subject is shared by
the people generally, and that the move
ment is in the fullest sense of the word a
public enterprise. By means of the money
thus raised employment has been afforded
to many industrious men, who would
otherwise have been without work and
wages, and whose families in many cases
would have been left destitute. The City
has made headway in the construction of
a thoroughfare which will be one of the
most famous in America. These are good
results and the wheelmen of tbe City
might take a just pride in allying them
selves with such an enterprise, and giving
it such aid and assistance as will render
its completion assured yi the near luture.
RESTORED CONFIDENCE.
A complete proof of the restoration of
confidence in iinancial and commercial
circles throughout the country is afforded
by the fact that the recent heavy ship
ments of gold to Kurope have occasioned
no alarm whatever, and that the people
everywhere read the reports of such ship
ments with undisturbed serenity. It will
be remembered that a very different feel
ing prevailed in the country when gold
shipments occurred under the Cleveland
administration, and in the contrast be
tween public sentiment now and what it
was then we have a standard by which to
measure the extent to which the McKin
ley administration has revived confidence
and restored t lie hopefulness of the people.
It is not difficult to understand why the
present gold shipments create none of the
alarm which was occasioned by similar
shipments before the Republican success
in the elections of last year. Tiie people
arc now aware that we i.aye at AYashing
ton an administration of statesmen who
understand the needs of the country and
are capable of rightly directing its legisla
tion. The deficit tariff, which has been
the cause cf so many ills in the past and
which compelled the Government again
and again to borrow money to pay its
running expenses and to maintain the
gold reserve, will soon be replaced by a
new tariff, which will not only supply an
ample revenue for the Nation, but will
afford protection lo American industry
and put an end to those heavy importa
tions of foreign goods which now draw
money away from us to Europe.
It was announced yesterday in New
York that there would be shipped from
that port to Bremen $977,000 in gold bars,
and on the sajne day it was announced
that from Boston a shipment would be
made on Thursday of $500,000 in gold.
From both cities, however, came the lur
ther statement that these shipments are
based solely on business lines and have
been received in financial circle? with an
entire absence of tho disquieting uncer
tainties of last year. Even the report
that the entire gold exports for the week
will probably aggregate $3,000,000 lias not
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 28, 1897.
in any way unsettled tbe money market
in either city.
It seems clear that we have at last
reached the period of restored confidence.
After this it wiil not be a long step
towaid the revival of prosperity. Now
that business men are so well satisfied
with the outlook that they can watch the
aram of gold without feeling any uneasi
ness we may be sure it will not be long
before they will begin to engage la those
enterprises which are needed to afford
employment to our people and to develop
the resources of the country. As soon as
tue tariff bill is enacted and uncertainty
in regard to import duties is over we may
I'<ok for renewed activity in all lines of
business. The McKinley administration
is doing its work well and the country has
no reason to complain of the results
which have been accomplished.
THE WOMAN'S CONGRESS.
In reply to the welcome which was ac
corded her by the audience at the
Woman's Congress on the opening day,
Mrs. Heien H. Gardener stated that,
while she lived and was educated in the
! East, she had noted and has repeatedly
i stated at gatherings in all parts of the
! country that the most progressive wcrk ol
; the time in being done in the West. We
I may rightly accept this as something
more than a complimentary phrase. The
i greeting given to Mrs. Gardener was sin
cere and it is but just to accord to her an
| equal sincerity in her response to it.
If the most progressive work of the
, time is being done in the West and if this
fact has been noted by observant and re
flecting leaders of thought and action in
; tue Kast, then we have encouragement to
jgo forward in what we have oegnn. It is
| time for the West, as well as for women, to
| open what Dr. David Starr Jordan so aptly
j called "the sealed orders" under which
jwe have been working in the past. It is
time for us to read the signs of tbe age, to
] know whe/e we are going and to work
j energetically to reach the destined port
by the nearest courses and the most favor
able winds which science and experience
can reveal to us.
It goes without saying that the men of
California and of the Greater West count
much upon women to aid them in the
great tasc of attaining all which destiny
promises. We are so near to the pioneer
days that we have not forgotten the emi
nent services which were rendered in the
unbuilding of our young commonwealth
by those brave women who shared all the
dangers, trials and hardships of tboso
struggles which were necessary to convert
the West from its former condition into
its present staÃe of civilization and pros
perity.
Knowing these things accomplished by
women in the past it is easy for us to
understand how much help can bo given
by women in solving the problems of the
future, and in the West, therelore, it is
inevitable that woman should be accorded
a recognition in every arena of human en
deavor into which she was willing to ven
ture ana in whose struggles she was
ready to take part
The Woman's Congress will therefore
receive in this City the attention which it
so well merits. Our people recogniza that
among those who are to take part in its
debates and discussions are some of the
most earnest leaders of the time, and that
among the problems which it will under
take to solve there are many which rank
among those of the greatest importance
both to society and to individuals. We
have received from Mrs. Gardener the
praisa that the most progressive work of
the time is being done in the West, and it.
is our dnty to see to it that this com
mendation will be deserved in the future
as in the past.

AMERi AS ARMY.
New York Herald.
Every year seems to make it more probable
that the close of the nineteenth century will
mark an epoch in the history of the world.
The thoughts of the nations have for some
time now been turned to the subject of war,
ana, incredible though it may Eeem, in the
event of a general call to arms, nearly
40.000,000 men could be placed in the field.
According to the London Daily Mail's esti
mate, the United Slates can call' upon a
greater number of trained toldiers than any
other oouutry in the world. Although the
standing army numbers only 27.000 men,
eaoh State has to support its own militia, and
should it bpcomÃ'necessary as a last resource
upward of 7.500,000 men could assist in main
taining the independence of the States.
I'o defend the coast there would be a navy
of some uevemy ships, wiih 10.000 men.
Of tiic European armies the biggest is that
of France. Thu number of men m the active
army and Us reserve is '2.350,000. The terri
torial army is 900.000 strong, Miid its reser-e
1,100.000, making a total of some 4,350,000,
It is not likely, however, that under *ny con
ceivable c.rcumsiances more than 2,500.000
men could be called ou ( . The navy, with 451
ships, also has n reserve of 114,000 men, of
whom about 25.500 are serving at the present
time with tlie fleet.
Next inpoiutof numbers on a war footing
comes Germany. The penre strength of the
standing army ig about 520,000. There has
been no late return of the war strength, but
in the last extremity Germany would have an
army of not far short of 8.000,000 trained
men, while 22.000 men coulu man the 220
odd vessels constituting the navy. The third
great power is Russia. The total peace foot
ing of this country is 900,000.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Frank W. Hawiey of New York, who is well
known upon this coast as an organizer of elec
trical enterprises, came up irorn the south
yesterday with a party of friends on a tour of
inspection of various electrical plants on the
Pacific Coast. Mr. Hawiey is vice-president of
the Cataract General Electric Company and
general manager of the Erie Canal Traction
Company, which distribute and use electricity
generated at Niagara Falls through the
State of New York.
Mr. Hawiey was asked aa to the use of elec
tricity as a motive power upon the Erie canal,
and replying said:
"Yes, electricity will be in use upon the
canal* of New York withiu the next two years
and will furnish the motive power for the
transportation of 4.0C0.000 tons of traffic from
Lake Erie to tidewater. It will operate 3000
canal-Doats in this work, doubling the nnm
ber of trips per season and greatly reduce the
cost of transportation. It Will give to the
ports of the Great Lakes extraordinary facili
ties for marketing the products of iho North
west in the city of New York and revolution
ize the movement of freight as it has the
transportation of passengers upon street sur
face railr >nds."
Mr. Hawiey was asked as to the electrical
development in general, and in replying said:
"Electrical development to-day is in its in
fancy. We have just come to know how to
generate it economically and how to put it in
service at the least possible expense. Even
the young can recollect when it lirst served the
purpose in transmitting a message. To-day it is
inaJe available in the factories of the world. It
is especially serviceable in your State, and put
to work can greatly reduce the cost of develop
ing mining properties. A current oÂ£ electri
city can be generated in nearly every canyon
iv the Rockies, and the power thus developed
transmitted many miles upon an economical
and commercial basis. It can perform as effi
cient service two hundred miles away as at the
point of generation."
Mr. Hawiey was asked as to how the power
could be used In the mining districts, to which
he said:
"A method of applying the power which
most commends itielf to me is by the use
of the cable way system. This is simply the
carrying of a load by an electric motor oper
ating upon a cable instead of a track. The
cable is suspended from a pole line and the
motor draws the carrier, which is also sus
pended. It is most simple in construction
and. most efficient in service. The current of
electricity passes through the very cable that
carries the load, and it thus furnishes the
power to operate drills, derricks and elevating
macninery at the mine, as well as the
motive force which propels the car contain
ing the ore in its transportation to the smelter
or Doint of shipment. The cable crosses tne
canyon and follows the lines of the gullies
through the mountains. It may be horizontal
at pouith and perpendicular at others. The
motor, however, maintains a uniform rate of
speed and operates with absolute safety and
certainty. The moterman may control a dozen
of these motors and thus reduce the cost of
transportation to a minimum."
Mr. liawley was asked as to whether the
water in irrigation ditches could be used to
generate power, to which he said:
"It certainly can be put to such a service,
provided at its source it can be carried to a
point where it can operate turbine wheels.
The water after operating the wheels can find
its way into the irrigation trenches, and the
electricity thus generated can operate pump
ing equipment which can be made mest ser
viceable in some sections of this mountainous
country. There ere many pumps operated
electrically which are available in reclaiming
valuableland."
Mr. Mam-ley was requested to express his
opinion upon the electrical development
which he has seen in this country.
"California," he said, "can well be proud of
what it has done in the way of the transmis
sion of power over long distances. While ex
periments have been made in this and foreign
countries, the first long-distance power trans
mission to operate upou a commercial basis
was installed within the limits of your own
State. I have visited several c'.anis in the
South, where I find power being transmitted
over long distances at a very moderate cost
and at a very much less price than a current
could be generated by wood or coal. The time
has passed when steam can be used to make
electricity in competition with water power."

The sealing schooner Luisa D, which

yesierday with 729 skins, all caught on the
coast. Their va. ue is about $5000, but the
money due the hunters and crew on their

the venture.
The captain of the schooner reports that

The Public Buildings Committee of the
Board of Supervisors dragged Baleman
Brothers, the contractors tor the Hail of
Justice, over the coals yesterday and de
manded an explanation o! th? alow prog
ress of the work on the new municipal
building.
Architect Sbea reported that the
amount of work so far accomplished v,-a*
far from satisfactory, and Chairman Shee
ban called upon a member of the con
tracting firm for the reasons for dolay.
Bateman said that the firm was hesitating
whether or not to make a contract with
ti.e Colusa Sandstone Company or open a
quarry of its own. He stated that th
i -.tone selected wan the s;ime as usetl on
lie new ferry building, .-md that the com
pany seomed to have tiiflkn ty in furnish

Architect Shea deniwii this statement.
He said that he had called on the presi
dent o! the stone company and hau
learned that Bateman BrotbÂ«rs had not
made any effort to let a contract for the
stone. The president haa informed him
that the company had a bie plant at the
quarry a:ul couid turn out as much stone
as was desired. He would iigree, Mr. Shea
said, to begin delivering stone in this City
within three d;iys after signing a contract.
Considerable surprise was expressed by
the coramitteemen at this state of affairs,
and Bateman was given distinctly to un
derstand that the-e deiuys were rendering
hii chances of getting an extension of
time on bis contract, should one be asked,
lesÂ« and less.
Bateman said that his brother was
handling the matter and that he was eat
isfied that it would be BottleJ up La a few
days. .

The promoters of the pure-food congress, to
be held on Friday and Saturday, hare received
a little setback. It was iheir hope to be able
to sÂ«cure from the Southern Pacific Company
n reduction of passenger rates for the dele
gates to the congress. The transportation
committee, consisting- of Julian Son n and
h. N. Kuwiey, called upon the official! of the
road to secure the desired reduction, but the
company declined to make any concession,
arguing that the ticket scalpers would get
hold of the half-rate tickets and sell to per
sons not entitled to the privilege* that go with
the aame. .

REVERES LINCOLN
Governor Budd Also Does
Honor to the Model
Citizen.
Gratifying Words of Praise
From Two Rpresenta
tive People.
"In This Money AgÂ»," S ys Miss
Willard, " Unco n's Character
Stands Ser.n ."
In these da ys when the grand figure of
Grant is being ilistinguished en tne East
ern coast by the eli:e of the Nation it
seems pecu iarly appropriate that the
Western project for honoring the ruar
tyrpd President, Lincoln, suouid be re
ceived wuh open hands and hearts.
The two monuments â twin sentinels of
patriotismâ would rightly stand on the !
Eastern and Western seaboards of the Na
tiou. At Riverside will tower the stately
meraorial to the patient, rugged genius
that could fight "all summer" if necessary
to achieve the purpose of a concentrated
srenius. In Golden Gate F ark may rise a
fitting tribute to ttie great raii--<plitterand
far-sighted war President, whose steady
paze was always fixed on the permanent
honor and glory of his darling republic.
Tuo consummation of this poetical and
practical project of commemoration may
well lend itself to earnest effort, and it is
evident that "the people" by their most
prominent repreÂ«entauves are eager to
iielp the realization of the twofolu crown
ine of patriotic genius.
Among; the latest letters on the subject
received are two from Frances E. Wlllard.
president of the World's Woman's Chris
tian Temperance Union, and from Gover
nor James H. Budd of Califo. nia, re

WILL EXPLOIT TRADE
Commercial Travelers tn Go From GÂ»I-
Tefton to the Spanish Main, Ceutral
America and Mexico. ;
For some time past the papers of Cali
fornia have been urging the merchants of
Oregon, Washington and this State to ex
tend their busine-s to Mexico and Central
American States. While the merchants
of the Northwest have been dreaming the
matter nas been taken up by people in
Galveston, Tex., and the following circu
lar has been sent to almost every merchant
in the three States named:
Acting on the suggestion of gome Northwest
ern manufacturer:- who are, de*' rous oi ex;eud

the ship to all purposes a floating commercial
Hotel. A stenograpnor. : a doctor and two
Spanish scholars to interpret and to teach the
Sgauish if desired, as well as one conversant
with custom-house routine, accompany the
expedition, which is calculated to rxtend over
six months at ieast. First, bacause the ship
stay* in each port sufficiently .long to give an
opDortunity to visit all important interior
towns. This also gives any one belated at a
preceding port the chance to catch up. and
thus meets the objection which the writer has
experienced on the roadâ that in a crowd of
travelers one often Â» has to await the others'
convenience. Second, the methods ot business
men in the tropics are different from and
vastly more delioerate than ours. Business
there cannot be rushed. : : ...
Alfred Tliier of San Francisco starts for
Galveston in a couDie of weeics. Ue wil]
be chM officer of the ship that is to carry
the expedition. He says that the cost of
the six months' trip to each drummer will
be about $800.

PORTLAND, Or., April 27.â City and
Suburban car 52, containing thirty pas- j
gengers, coming i:i from Mount Tabor, j
cscaited the control of Motorman John G. j
Kitffcr at 7 o'clock this morning, left the i
rai a on East Morrison street, a few f?et j
east of the corner of East Eighth, plowed ,
its way across the bridpe with a quick i
pwerve to the south, struck the sidewalk !
ami, carrying away planking and string- I
era, plunged into the slough below, taking j
with it a score or more of passengers. Of i
tho=e aboard thro? are dud:
W. W. Blakcharo, engineer of the Acme 1
Flouring-mills, 46 years of age, living at I
East Thirty-fourth street.
Nobtos Uaxsen, US years old, employed
in ihe Great l-.astern lea Company and
residing at Sunnyside.
Mibs Catherine Baili.ie, aged 25 years, of
ll.iiKu*, who was visiting Mrs. Alexander j
at Mount 'labor.
Others of the passengers have been taken !
to their homes badly injured. They were: ;
Miss Lizzie Lawrence, employe of the
Troy Laundry, living at Giencof, injured I
internally.
Larsen brothers of Glencoe, one with
an arm broken and the other bruised
about the shoulders.
Andrew Gatzka, living at Glencoe, arm
broken and legs slightly bruised.
J. N. Casey of 111 East Thirtr-fifth
street, employed in Gadsby'a furniture \
store, injured slightly on the right leg j
and arm.
Ernest Brown, an employe of the cigar
box factory on Front street, received a few â 
client scratches.
J. C. Butler, living at 1067 East Morri
son street, injured on the right shoulder
nnd severely bruised about the limbs.
Earl Hunter, a Sunnyside groceryman,
s tghtly bruised on the back.

jured.
Conductor Guthrie, arm broksn and re- j
ceived internal injuries which may possi
bly result fatally.
Motorman Kieffer, slight bruises.
A. Teller of Mount Tabor, injured on
right shoulder and arm.
Plunging and tearing alone over the '
ear hen pavement, the car flew on to the i
bridge crossing the slough. There was a ;
rattle and crushing of planking, and then, {
when about sixty feet from the bank, the j
car swung off to the left. With a crash !
the iront truck struck the wooden curd- I
ing of the bridge walk. Like so much j
pasteboard it gave way, and, pushing tba
sidewald to its own width ahead of it, the
car plunged head downward into the
slough twenty feet below.
There was one agonizing scream from
the doomed passengers as the car toppled
over, above which rang the cry of Con- i
ductor Guthrie, "Jump or you'll be
killed." The brave fellow remained at
his post and went down with the car.
The scene was horrifying. Aside from :
the bodies of the dead there were to be â¢
seen those still living but nnconscious
and slowly drowning, their struggles,
momentarily growing more feeble, driv
ing the rescuers to giant efforts in the
endfavor to Bare those pinioned under ,
the wreck.
The first victim extricated was young j
Norton Hansen. Ha;iÂ«en was frightfully j
mangled, his left thigh, left arm and back i
being broken, while a gasb had been cut
in his groin from which the lifeblood j
welled in a flood.
The next one removed was little Andy
GatzKa, an Evening Telegram newsboy.
He had received a crashing blow on the
head, cutting t tie scalp in a long deep gash
and stunning him.
Following little Gatzka came the still
inert body of W. W. Blanchard. He was
dead. The frothy ioamon bis lips plainly
denoted drowning, althougn a sharp line j
ol bruises on the right side of the face
would indicate that a blow had produced
unconsciousness as Blanchard reached thÂ»
water.
The next body drawn from the wrecked
r.jid submerged car was that of a hand- !
some, well-dressed woman, apparently 26 j
years of age. Her- appearance and every
part of iier apparel denoted culture and
refinement. When taken irom the water
tho.body was still warm and every effort
was made to resuscitate it, but all efforts
proved fruitless. This woman had re
ceived severe bruises about the right side
of the face. She was Miss Catherine
Baillie.
Patrol waeons were soon on hand, and
â within rifieen minutes the last injures
survivor had been thken from the scene.
Then the car was raised to make certain
that all of the passengers had been ac
counted for.
The survivors say the car was running
down the grade at a speed of at least
fifteen mileian hour, ur.d when it reached
Eleven'h street, about three blocks from
the scene of the accident, the niotorman
lost control by reai-on of the br:iK?s refus
ing to work. Wnen he realized that the
car was beyond his conirol, and when a
?p?ed of twenty-tive nitres an hour had
been attained, the motorman jumped nnci
left the car to dash down the grade with
its passenger*. The conductor attempted
to stop it with i he rear brate, but the
speed was too ereat. About li ty feet
from the bridge there is B curve, ami when
the runa flay car reached this it jumped
t lie track. After the car had run about
sixty feet it struck the railing of tlie
briige which cave way, precipitating the
pat-seiiKers and car into the slough.
Before the crash came several pa>sencfrÂ«<
jumped and escapeu with only a slignt
shaking up. Fortunately, when tiie acci
dent occurred me water in me slough was
not deep, nr.d one end of the car remained
above water. Had tiie car run twenty Icet
iurther before going through it is probable
that every p.'rson remaining inside would
have teen drowned, as the water thÂ«re is
twenty feet deep.
'I he Coroner's jury will attempt to place
the blame lor the seemingly avoidable
disaster.

LOS ANGELES WIDOW'S DEFEAT.
Decision Against Mrs. Spencer in the
Suit Brought by Her Late Hus
band's Children.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 27.â Judge ,
Van Dyke to-day deeded the bitterly con- '
tested ca?e of Isabel .Spencer vs. Anna P. i
Spencer et al. The interests at stafce In
the litigation were extensive, consisting i
largely of real property which had been
deeded to young Mrs. Spencer during the ;
lifetime of her husband, Ambrose H. I
Spencer. The property is estimated to be j
worth from 1150,000 to $200,000.
It was upon the validity of the-e deeds
that the controversy arose. The children j
of Mr*. Spencer believed themselves to j
have been badly dealt with, and contended j
that Widow Spencer had obtained the !
deed? to all the property by undue influ- j
ence over their father.
The testimony introduced was of a re
i martab.e nature. It showed that Mrs.
Spencer was a very vigorous woman men- i
tally an 1 physically, and tnat her husband .
wits old and feeble during the later years ;
lof their married life. It became incum- j
; bent on Mis. Spencer to show that she had
treated her husband as a dutilui, loving j
wife, and she was key:t on the witness-,
stand for many hoar?.
A number of the most prominent peo- '
\ pie in the city were witnesses at one time j
I or another in the case, and tho decision
i has been awnited with great interest.
Judge Van Dyke, in his opinion filed '
this morning, gives an elaborate review of '
the testimony and comments in passing I
upon the many incongruities in the state- !
mentsof Mrs. Spencer and her failure to
make good her claim-. The Judge con
cluded bis decision as follows:
"My conclusion is, from all of the testi
mony and circumstances, tnat the plain
ilff has made out a case, and, further, that j
the action is not barred by the statute of
limitation*. This result will still ieave I
the defendant in possession of the prop- {
erty in question, Ambrose H. Spencer |
having died Intestate and she being one
of the three heirs."

REDWOOD CITY, Cal., April 27.-
The twentieth annual session of the
Grand Parlor, Native Sons of the Golden
West, was re-enforced to-day by the ar
rival of Mayor James D. Pbelan of San
Francisco and State Senator Thomas
Flint Jr. of San Juan, past grand presi
dent of the order. Political topics cannot
be introduced into the Grand Parlor, but
in the newspapers it may be said that
neither Flint nor Phelan would get out of
the way if a nomination for Governor of
California should be coming straight
toward him.
Senator Flint arrived during the fore
noon and was warmly greeted by a throng

of fellow-delegates. Mayor Phelan had to i
open the Women's Congress in San Fran
i cisco, hence he came late in the day, but
j the warmth of greeting extended to him
I wan not diminished by the lateness of his
I coming.
Leonard S. Calkins of Nevada City won
I hi? flzht to-dÂ«y for h;s mountain town,
' and the Grand Parlor will go to Nevada
I City in 1898.
The Grand Parlor met at 10 o'clock this
] morning. Charles M. Belshaw called up
i the following resolution offered by him in
! 1896, a<* an amendment to the resolution
I providing that the next session of the
: Grand Parlor should be held in Nevada
! City:
ftatolred. That article IV, grand constitution,
< t>" aiii'Mi'j"<l astollows: Strike out the wordi
I "and shall continue to meet at auch lime and
place as may b 1 agreed upon," and iusert "at
i â¢. lie City and County of rian Francisco, and
1 shall continue to meet at said City."
The resolution to amend was declared
! out of order.
On motion of Leonard S. Calkins the
resolution fixing Nevada City as the
, place for holding the session of 1893 was
, adopted.
L. W. J Milliard of Santn Rosa intro
| duced tne following resolution:
Rrtotred, That the general Admission day
celebration on September 9, 1897, be held at
the city of Santa Kosa.
The resolution was unanimously
adopted.
Tbe committee on state of the order
| reported recommending thai the several
I reports submitted be received and referred I
{ to appropriate committees. In conelu-
I sion the report says:
"We have carefully examined the re
ports of the various giand officers and
district deputies, and from them we find
' the ordÂ»r to be in a nourishing condition
j financially and otherwise. There has
; been a considerable increase of member
ship throughout the State, but owing to j
, the laxity of the secretaries of some of the !
' subordinate parlors in tiling their reports j
â¢â  with the grand secretary, we have been j
unable to arrive ai an accurate conclusion
relative to li.c increase or decrease of the j
; (lnafWss of the order. We earnestly rec
ommend that the members of the visiting
board impress upon the secretaries of sub
j o-dinate parlors the importance of filing
| accurate reports with the grand secre
j tary,"
The following amendment to article 11, j
! section 1, of the constitution, relating to
membership of subordinate lodges, was i
submitted :
Section 1. Its members shall be confined to
white mules who were born within the State
of California prior to the year 1900 and to
theii male descendant* born within said State.
Mr. Deccer moved that the amendment
be printed and distributed to eaci subordi
nate parlor of the order for its action, and
their reports transmitted to the grand
secretary, and that final action be taken
thereon at the next Grand Parlor.
At firstglance ono mieht infer that the
! color line was involved in the foregoing
amendment, but the change refers to a
limitation of time, and is designed to ex-
I elude from the order those not corn in the
j nineteenth century. The Pioneers drew
! the limit at 1849. Even the Pioneers
| themselves recognize tnat many estimable
| people came here as late as the "spring of
'50," but the line had to be marked, and
it was run close to the center of the cen
tury.
The Native Sons will talk over the 1900
! proposition during the year to come, and
i may decide to estaDlish an exclusive or
der. Should that policy be adopted an in- j
stunt effort will be made to provide for
tbe abolition of the beneficial system.
Benefits cannot be fixed on a sound and ,
paying basis unless assessable youngsters '
are annually recruited, to take tha place !
of the old boys who are crossing tue range j
and Roing down on the shady side.
H. G. W. Dinkelspi?l and Eugene M.
I^evy. delegates irom Bay Cuy Parlor No.
104, proposed an amendment to the con- \
stituiion dfKignatinj the following as '
elective ofiicers: Grand president, grand
vice-presiiient, grand second yice-presi- |
dent, grand secretary, grand treasurer, J
grand orator, grand marshal, grand inside j
sentinel, grand outside sentinel and seven I
grand trustees.
At the atternoon session of the order
the advocates of tlie measure to make San
Francisco the place for permanent s siions
of the Giand Parlor a*ked leave to with
draw a pending resolution to ame the
constitution in this regard and submit the
question to the i>ntiTe Sons in the form of
a circular to each subordinate parlor.
The interior decorations of the Alham-
Itii, where the sessions of the Grand Par
lor are held, preient some pleasing as
pects. Art is displayed in the blending of
soft tints in drapery. The festooning is
in pink, white and blue. Hears, *Â»agles
and shields are exhibited. Each shield is
surmounted by a gilded eagle and flanked
by American flap*. Star-spangled streamers
radiate from a canopy in the center of the
auditorium at the height of the chande
lier. The atage is partially screened by
two large flags.
Tne op;n-air concert in front of the
Courthouse this aiternoon brought many
people to town from the surrounding
country. This festure of the celebration
has attained great popularity, an the
ather is delightful.

ARIZONA CONVICT PARDONED.
Murderer Apsey, Who Killed and Cremated
an Employe, Leaves State
Prison.
PHOENIX, Ariz., April 27.â 1n order to
restore him to <itzenÂ«Â»hip Governor
Franklin has pardoned Robsrt O. Apsey
out of the Territorial penitentiary at
Yuma. ApÂ«ey was committed from Pinal
(Jounty in 1890 on a ten years' sentence
for manslaughter. The crime for which
he was convicted was a most revolting
one, and the verdict of the jury has al
ways been a marvel to the understand
ing of ordinary men. According to the
evidence, Apsey was caught in the act of
cremating the body of a man whom he
had murdered.
The discovery was made by Captain J.
W, Watson, U. S. A., nn.i a party of In
dian scouts from San Carlos, who were
out after renegade Indians. When they
reached Apsey's ranch, seven miles below
the Deer Creek coal field, they detected
I the oder of burning flesh. In reply to a
] question from Captain Watson, Apsey
said he was roasting a hog. "Rowdy,"
I the noted scout, who was with the party,
declared that the odor was that of Durn
me human flesh.
Captain Watson ordered an investiga
tion, and the charred remains of a man
were discovered. These were at once
identified as the remains of a man who
, worked for Apsey and to whom Apsey
owed $100. The theory of the prosecution
i was that Apsey killed: the man to avoid
his frequent demands for payment, and
this was borne out by both direct and
circumstantial evidence.

NEW YORK, N.Y.. April 28.â The Press
says: Al Smith, stakeholder in the Car

a prominent hotel to-day by declaring
that Fitzsimmons didn't receive a cent of

"More than that," said Smith, "I can
tell you this, and yon know what my word

ring to fight for the purse. Before i?oing
into the ring he agreed with Dan -Stuart
to waive all right to the purse and accept
instead 25 percent.
"I have - hesitated about speaking of
this, Bmith added, "because I didn't
wish to discount Fit ziimmons' victory iv
anyway. All other arguments aside .hÂ«

FRESNO, Cal., April 27.â The annual
spring race meeting of the Fresno Jockey
Club openea at the track to-day with an
excellent days's sport. The attendance
was fairly pood, but not up to what the
races deserved. The meet will continue
during the remainder of the week and
every one is waiting for the last days,
when they expect to see the b"si events.
Tiie track is not in as good condition as
it ought to be. It has always been con
sidered one of the best in the State, and
with a small amount of work It could
have been placed in as good shape as it
ever has been. A large number of horses
have been entered for the meet and some
line racing i* assured.
To-day's events were interesting and
fairly uood time was made. Tbe betting
was lively, considerable money changing
hands. The new starting-gate was used
on the track for the first time. It is oper
ated by electricity and proved a very ac
ceptable innovation.
There were three running events on the
programme. Jim IJozeman won the
three-quarters of a ini:e dash in 1:17. The
quarter of a mile and repeat was won by
fcontag, a third heat being required be
tween the winner and Lady Kern. In
the final heat Lady Kern's rider pulled
up for some reason at the start and the
judges declared all pools off. The times
were :2.{, :23 and :24. The third race, a
iive-eigaths of a miie clash, was a pretty
one. All broke io a perfect start. Quick

ONE DAY MORE IN
MARRIOTT`S TRIAL
Testimony in Regard to
the People's Home
Case.
The Whereabouts of Judge Heb
bard, Mr. Sheehan and
Mr. Watt.
Counsel for the State Did Not Want
Mr. Watt's Actons Inquired
Into.
There was some interesting testimony
in the Marriott libel case in Judge Dain
gerfielri's court yesterday, and the court
room was crowded, showing that the in
terest of the people has been aroused in
this struggle for the freedom of the press
that is going on.
In the morning session an effort was
made by Samuel W. Sbortridge, attorney
for the defendant, Editor Frederick Mar
riott of the News- Letter, to show that
there was a certain understanding between
Judge J. C. B. Hebhard of the Superior
Court and Attorney James Alva Watt and
John F. Sheeban in reeard to the manage
ment of the defunct People's Home Sav
ings Bank, said understanding having fo
its purpose the keeping of Mr. Sheehan in
his place as receiver for the bang, and in
cidentally the retention of Mr. Watt as
attorney for the receiver.
In view of the court's rulings Mr.
Shortr.dge found it expedient to tempora
rily withdraw his first witness and to call
Attorney X. Carl Spelling, who, fhough a |
par.icuiar friend of Judge Hebbard, Mr. |
Sbeehan and Mr. Walt, made some start- |
ling disclosures, which, Mr. Sbortridge ex
plaiued, were fores It a dewed in his open
ing statement when he said that he would
prove that Judge Hobband "stood in"
with the persons who helped to waste the
substance of the bank's depositors, and
that to that extent Judge Hebbard was,
as tiie News-Letter said, the "creature"
and â¢tool" of designing men.
Mr. Spelling ie-titied that he was em
ployed as an attorney to bring a suit in |
the name of Goldtree and others against
the Home Savings Bank, but that bis j
clients did not pay him anything for that I
service. Subsequently he was paid $600 i
by the directors ot the People's Home !
Savings Bank, but he did not understand
that it was for bringing the Goldtree suit.
He was rather hazy in his i.ieas on tiint
point, but thought he gave the People's |
Home Savings Bank managers some kind
of advice. He acted as counsel in their
litigation.
Mr. Shortridge pressed the questions to
show that the Goldtree suit was instituted
at the de-ire of Mr. Sheehan and his
friends.
Mr Shortridgeâ Was it late at night when
you riled that Goldtree suit T
The witnessâ l think it was about 9 o'clock
at night.
You rode out in a carriage from the Palace
Hotel to the City Hall after 9 o'clock to tile the
papers, did you not?
Yea.
Who rode out in the carriage with you?
I rode out with James Alva Watt and John
11. Durst.
D:<i you find Judge Hebbard at the City
Hall?
Yes.
Where?
In Ills chambers.
Did Judge Hebbard sign an order that night
appointing some one receiver for the bank iv
me Goldiree tuii?
res.
What did he do with the order?
I think he gave it to Mr. Durst. He might
have given it to Mr. Watt, lam not sure about
that.
Attorney Julius Kahn and DeDuty Dis
trict Attorney Hinule attempted to ex
plain how Judge Hebbard happened to
be at the City Hall at 9 o'clock at night,
although everybody could see that it was
a handy thing for Mr. Watt to have been
there.
'â¢Wasn't i he clerk of the court present?"
asked Mr. Kahn.
"1 think not, 1 ' replied Mr. Spelling. "I
don't remember seeing him there."
T. H. McCartny, vice-principal of the
Washington Grammar School, a member
of the depositors' committee, gave an out
line of the efforts made to secure the
money of the depository and to keep it
from being wasted by litigation.
Mr. McCarthy said: "We obtained at
that B'nai B'rith Hall meeting about 1600
signatures r.| depositors, aggregating be
tween $300,000 and $400,000 of the money
deposited. The peopie giving those sig
natures authorized us in writing to pro
ceed in every way possible to advance ihe
interests of depositors, with the exception
of drawing money, which we did not at
| tempt."
In reply to a question by Mr. Short
i ridge the witness saiJ : "The tirst thing
the committee tried to do was to get a
board of directors that would do some
thing for the benefit of the depositor*.
We were particularly anxious to accom
plish this, and had conversations with the
members of the old board. Five of them
saiu they were willing to resign, but taid
that the injunction issued by Judge Heb
bard prevented them from meeting for
any purpose. We called on Judg> Heb
bard and he promised to modify tbe in
junction so as to allow the old board to
resign and to have the directors, chosen by
NEW TO-DAY.

"The comn'ittee serured the consent of
! P. B. Fliiit, Dr. M. H. Loean, W. P. Wil
son and S. A- McDonell to act on ihe
board of directors, ;:nd we called on Judge
Hebbard to have him fix a time for tho
carrying out of his promise to allow the
old board to resign, biit Ju ige Hebbard
refused to keep his promise."
"Did any persons present give fhetr as
sent to the resignation of the old board?"
i asked Mr. Shortridge.
"Yes. Attorney W. H. Hutton was
there us attorney tor the committee and
the depositors. Ho asked that the old
boarl should be permuted to resign.
D. M. Delnias and S. M. Slioriridge, as at
torneys for the old board, made a similar
request."
"Did any one risa up and object to
JudEre Hebbard kpenin? his promise?' 1
"Yes. James A'va Watt an-1 John H.
Dtir-'t objecte I. Mr. Watt was attorney
foi John H. Sheehan, the receiver."
"Do you know why Mr. Watt objected
and what induced judge Hebbard to ig
nore his promise?"
"I think I do."
"Please state what you know of it."
Attorneys Kahn and Hmkie objected.
Mr. Kinkle said it would not bs fair to
Judge Hebbard, the prosecuting witness.
Mr. S ortrulse said th?re seemed to bo
a very tender regard for the prosecuting
witness, and Mr. Hinkle wanted to know
who was the injured party, to which Mr.
Sliortridce referred counsel to the indict
ment, which alleged that the State has
been injured.
Then roliowed a sharp debate as to the
proper procedure. Judge Daingerfield
raid it wa- evident that counsel lor the
State objected to any testimony regarding
the acts or motives of Mr. Watt unless
they could be connected with tho acts or
motives of Judge HebbarJ. The court
was inclined to sustain the objection un
less Mr. Shortrid<Â»e could fir^t show that
there was somÂ»Â» connection or understand
in" between Mr. Watt and Judge Heb
bard.
Mr. Shortridee wanted to have this testi
mony recorded and said that he would
connect it all with Judge Hebbard. He
argued that this testimony tended to and
would prove that Judge Hebbard know
ingly or unknowingly was the mere in
strument, the creature or 100 l of men who
were antagonistic to the depositors. Under
the court's ruling the defense must first
call Mr. Watt and ass him as to his rela
tions with Judge Hebbard, and then re
call Mr. McCarthy.

OF THE LAST YEAR
Over Seventeen Millions

Wealth.
Nevada County's Spend d Rec

Looms Up.
A F w Couaties Show Decreased Out
put-The Grea'est Yield ii
Thirt ea Years.
The statistician of the mint completed
his labors of ascertaining the production
of gold and silver in the State yesterday,
and estimates that for the Year ending
December :il. 1896, $17,181,902 70 in gold
and Hâ.-lt' ! 70 in silver, or a total of
$17,604.0:20 0, was ad aed to the wealth of
the country from this source only. Com
pared with the result for 1895 there has
be^n an increased production of gold in
1896 of $1 847,243 01, and a decrease in the
value of Â»ilver produced of $177,326 10.
Owing to the large number of new
mines opened and the delay of many of
the large producers in forwarding results
of the year's work the report of the
statistician is at least three weeks behind
that of former years. Some of the miner<
eaem to have a repugnance to furnishing
the mint with the desired information,
and many cannot be induced to do so at
all, and therefore the totals can confi
dently be relied upon as the minimum of
the State's productiveness, as the results
are in no case estimated, but compiled
from actual reports of the mines. Tnis
difficulty can only be remedied by statute.
So long as a report of a mine is not made
obligatory there will be many who will
Dot report at all.

Nevada County is more firmly in
trenched as the banner county of the
State than ever before. The remarkable
advance shown in the pnst year is aue to
the increased interest shown and comes
almost entirely from the old producers.
The splendid record of Tuolumoe County
is due to the same cause.
San Diego, with an increased production
of $216.270 43, is a surprise, though the re
sult astonishes no one familiar with tne
activity displayed in the opening of new
mines in the rich new Colorado River re-
Eion.
KÂ«rn County, with an increased output
of $359,433 41, makes a notable record and
one that will amaze many who are uuac
qnainteJ with its resources. The increase
conies wholly from the new Randsburg
district, and establishes that rich poriiou
cf the State as a gold-producer:

The list of counties showing a decreased
roduciion of gold includes some from '
â¢viicti a different result was anticipated.
alavoras, which has the Utica mine as
its largest producer, comes short of expec
tations, but this is easily understood by
those' who are nware of the immense
f.niount of work being done among the
mines of the county preparatory to open
ing np new territory in Tiew of a larger
output in tbe futrre. " The same explana- ]
tion hold* good in the case of Shasta, Plu
t.at and Mono counties.
Ihe result of the whole State, though
less in amount than predicted by the more
sanguine, it regarded as a most encour
aging one and is an indication of the new
-'ile which has been injected into the in
dustry throughout thÂ« entire area of the
fitate. Tne outlook is regarded as cheer
ing. A very large number of old mines
*"ill be reopened thii year and the vast
tSi.'Uat of deyelcpmect work being done
on new mines assures a great increase in
the gold producers of the State.
The output oi gold for 1896 is the larpest
in thirteen yearÂ«.

CHINESE THICKEST.
Another Defeat of the Revenue Officials
br Wily Chinese.
About & week ago revenue officials seiied
14,000 cigars and 500 pounds of tobacco in
the factory of the Tong Yen Company at
722 Washington street and arre-ted Lee
Suie on a charge of violating the revenue
laws by using cigar boxes a second time
without canceling the stamps and obtain
ing new ones.
Suie wan released on giving bonds in the
sum of $250, with Lee Lung of 715 Dnpont
street and Lee Fung of 716 Wellington
street as sureties. The revenue officers
locked up the factory and placed the seal
of thedepartmenton the lock. Last Mon
day nignt the lock was broken and the
place was robbed. Nine hundred cigars
and some tobacco we c taken, the burglar
evidently having been scared off before he
could secure all the plunder.

DRUMMOND'S
DASHING FORAY
Personality of the Man Who
Is Making a Conquest
of Honduras.
Ambiticus to Rule a Fair Land
Tw C 9 as Large as San
Bernardino.
His Intrepid March Toward Teguci
galpa â An Imitator of the Famous
Filibuster Wa k-r-
The special to The Call yesterday from
New Orleans saying the steamer Buck
note had arrived there from Honduras
wit ii the news that an Englishman named
Drummond was, by the assistance of some
twenty English and American follower?,
making a complete conqi.est of Honduras,
was read here with much interest. Drum
mond, the dispatch said, had marched on
Puerto Cortez, captured it and moved on
The Gty of Tegucigalpa, on Which Filibuster Drummond Is
Leading His Forces.
[Drawn from a late photograph.}
to San Pedro, which place he also cap
tured, and after taking possession of the
two trains on the railroad, struck across
the country to make a conquest of Teguci
galpa, the capital of the little republic.
Ex-President Desoto was said to be look
ing on complacently from Beiize, which
is the capital of British Honduras, and
near at hand. Druramond recently
shipped a lot of rifles in bales of hay from
New Orleans, and got into the papers at
the time. He seems an intrepid, daunt
less sort of fellow, much like General
Walker, the famous filibuster of Nica-
iaeua
What adds to the keenness of the
interest regarding tue end of his foray is
i he statement that "enriched by the
custom-house receipts, Dnimmond and
his array captured all the neighboring
villages before attacking the town of San
Pedro, wnere Goyernnient forces, 300 in
number, were put to flight."
But more than this, he captured two
entire trains and locomotives. Tho attack
ing party waÂ« armed witn Winchester
rifles and" two Gatling Rims. By the time
Drummond and bis followers had reached
I and conquered San Pedro, ihis force had
| swollen to fully 1000 men, those who joined
1 then being aUsatislied with the admin.s
tratlon of President tfonilla. It was with
this force that Druramond struck out for
Tegucigalpa.
Puerto Cortez, which he first took, is
the important coast town nearest British
Honduras. Fioru them D.-urarnond and
nis li'tle band proceeded up the Charmeli
j con River to San Pedro and took that
! place. They had previously taken the
town of Cabiido, and they now took

Drummond and His Line of March Toward the Capita.
formal possession of the railway between I
Puerto Ccrtez, witb all the cars and loco
motives. This railroad Is thirty-seven
miles long, and is very important when
the subjugation of the republic is consid
ered.
It appears that as Drurnmond advanced
with his determined lollowers he had
things virtually his own wny. Tne troops
deserted their standards, and at one time
600 men fled to the woods.
Dr. E. Calderon, the Consul-General of
Honduras, Nicaragua and Salvador, was
considerably interested in the foray of j
Drummond. He said the last correspond- j
enoe he had was to the effect that affairs
were quiet in Honduras. It costs 70 cents I
a worj by telegraph and cable to get news
from Tegucigalpa. All the dispatches
come by way of Galveston.
"I have heard a number of times about
this man Drummond," sail F. de Mi
randa, one of the owners of the ship Mad
elaiue and operator of big oil wells in
I'eru. "The troub'.e is the same that baa
been agitating the country at times for
several years. It originated at Belize. I
never met Mr. Drummond, however."
Honduras is a beautiful little country,
about twice as big as Ban Bernardino
County, has very good mines, a fine cli
mate and rich soil adapted to the growing
of coffee, tobacco, corn and tropical fruits, j
The bigceÂ«t town is Teeucigalpa, witb
about 16.000 people. The whole popula- j
tion is about 450,000. or a little more than '
ban Francisco. Puerto Cortez, the coaÂ»t j
lowu wliick Druuimoud touK asa sw.rt.off, '
has about 8000 people, so Dr. Calderon
stated.
The results of Drummond's campaign
ing will be watched with interest. If he
succeeds tv making the country entire and
holding It permanently, he will do what
has not been accomplished by Â«o j-mall a
force on this or any other continent proo
ably in a hundred years, or at least noth
ing like it sinre California was wrested
from the Spanish by our people.
THE SCUOLA ITALIANA.
The Little One* Had a Pleaiant Outing

RATES TO POINTS
IN MARIN COUNTY
Reductions Asked in Single
Fares and Commu
tations.
The Investigation of the Matter
Held Be .'ore the Railroad
Commission.
Two Railroai Presidents oa the
Witness-Stardâ McCue Conduct-,
the Examination.
Shall the round-trip fare between San
Francisco and San Rafael and all inter
mediate points be reduced to 25 cents, and
shall the men's monthly commutation
tickets between the same points be re
duced to ?3, the amount charged for
women, were the two issues that were pre
sented to the Railroad Commission yes
terday.
The-?e questions were raised in the com
plaint filed seme weeks ago by James S.
McCue against Ihe San Francisco and
Nonh Pacific Railroad and the North
Pacific Coast Railroad. This charged that
Corte Madera was discriminated against,
ns the lare from San Francisco to San
Rafael, a considerably longer distance
than from San Francisco to Corte Mndera,
was the same as bitween SÂ»n Francisco
and Corte Madera; ttiat discrimination
was practiced in charging men ?5 for
monthly commutation tickets and women
only $3, and that discrimination also ex
isted in maKing a round-trip rate of 25
cents between San Francisco and San Ra
iael to members oi the Scbuetzen Club.
McCne was present in person and was
permitted to conduct the examination.
Jesse W. lilienthal represented the Snn
Francisco and North Pac:fio X nil road and
C. P. Eells appeared for the North Pacific
Coast.
President A. W. Foster of the San Fran
cisco and North Pacific was the first wit
ness called, lie at once put McCue on
record as having inaJe a statement that
the road of which witness is president was
not making any money. On this ground
alone, he claimed, the complaint so far as
it concerned the road ought to be dis
missed.
In response to questions by McCue,
Foster teatined that the fare from San
Francis-co to San Clemente, four miles ihis
side of San Rafael, was 50 cents, the same
as the fare Irom San Francisco to San
Rafael; that the same rate was charged
to Greenbrae and to Ban Quentin; that
the share of the railroad in ttie fare to San
Quentin was 25 cents, the other 25 cents
going to the stage line between Greenbrae
and San Quentin ; that an excur.-ion rate
of 25 cents for the round trip between San
Francisco and San Rafael was granted to
the members of the Scbuetzen Club, the
members atul attendants of the military
academy at San Rafael and the inmates
of the convent at the same place; that a
$5 commutation rate was charged for men
between San Francisco and San Rafael,
and a $3 rate for women between the same
points.
The reason women were e ranted a lower
rate than men, he explained. waÂ» because
many women did not use their tickets
more than ten or a dozen times a month.
He uNo explained hit the reason for
charging haif-rates on Sundays for return
tickets to points north of San Rafael and
lull existing rates to San Rafael and
points ti-is side of it was that San Rafael
had already been given the benefit of such
a reduction. The reduced rale- on Sun
day were made to encourage suburban
travel.
J. B. Stetson, president of the North
Pacific Coast Railroad, was next sworn.
In the course of his examination he stated
thai the fare from San Francisco to Corte
Madera was 50 cents and from Sf n Fran
cisco io Mill Valley it was 40 cents,
although the distance was about the same
from San Francisco to either point. He
also tes:ified that men.-* monthly commu
tation tickets between ban Francisco and
Corte Madera were sold for $5 and be
tween San Francisco and Mill Valley for
$4. This difference in the charge, he said,
was due to the greater cost of construc
tion of the main line on which Corle Ma
dera is located. The tunnel through
which the road passes beiore reaching
Corte Madera, he in ormed the commis
sion, cost about $160,000; the branch to
Mill Valley runs along bottom land.
President Stetson also admitted to favor
ing the ladies who traveled over his road
with a $3 r.ue for commutation tickets be
tween San Rafael and San francisco.
McCue took the stand and attempted to
show by figures, wh.cii he said had been
prepared by an expert, the cost of con
struction of IbcNortb Pacific Coast road.
An objection was made by Attorney Eells
to the introduction of these figures unless
it was fitst shown that the person who
prepared the statement was qualified to
testify as an expert. McCue did not have
his expert present nor did he condescend
to name him. The commission sustained
the obioction and McCue abandoned all
ntteinpi to go into construction cost, in
terest charges and other similar data. He
.;iiil he was willing to leave the whole
matter to the judgment and discretion of
the commission.
This closed the presentation of testi
mony.
McCue opened the argument. He
claimed there waa discrimination against
Corte Madera and against ma:e passen
gers on the North Pacific Coast road, and
asked that the round-trip rate between
San Francisco and San Rafael and all in
termediate points be reduced to 25 cents,
and that the discrimination against malt
passengers be properly adjusted by re
ducing commutations to them to $3. He
also made the same pica in reference to
the San Francisco and North Pacific road.
He made the claim that the commutation
rate to women could not be raised, and
that the Sunday half rate should be made
to apply to all points. He asserted that
there would be 10,000 mire people in
Marin County in two years if fares were
reduced.
Atiorney Lilienthal claimed that so far
as me To.-iii he represented was concerned,
McCue was not a resident of any point on
tbe road, and therefore had no standing
before the commission. He denied there
was any discrimination, and held that in
asmuch as it bad been admitted by the
prosecuting witness that tbe road was los
ing money the commission could not
justly reduce any of its rates. He con
tended that as the women commuters
used their tickets only a small portion of
the month, they would bs properly con
sidered a different c!as- of passengers
from men, who used their tickets daily.
Eells argced on the same lines and
claimed further that the constitution gave
tbe companies the right to make ex
cursion and commutation rates without
regard to the clause prohibiting discrim
inations.
McCue closed tbe argument without
making any new point, and tbe matter
was taken under advisemen .
The railroad people claim that the sale
of commutation tickets is not a rate ac
cording to the constitution, and that they
hare tbe right to withdraw such tickets
and put in a new schedule for commuters.
If the $3 rate to women is held to be a
discrimination it in probable that it will
be raised to $5. and the representatives of
both companies claim ihey could not
stand a reduction of the commutation rate
to men.

Health Officers Want Sarah
Sheehan's Death In
vestigated.
Dr. George Adam, the Family
Physician, Reported the
Case.
Developments in the Loring Case
Made the Officials Sus
picious.
Poor Sarab Sheehan, for her sin, now
lies on a slab in tbe Morgue. She is the
18-year-old daughter of a bard working
laborer living xt 210 Moulton street, tbU
City. Last Sunday morning she d:ea, and
when tbe relatives brought tbe deatb cer
tificate signed ty Dr. George Adam to the
office of the Board of Health, the Health
Officer declined to issue a burial permit,
the cause of death being stated as peri
tonitis.
Experience in the case of Mrs. Loring
had mnde the Health Office more careful
about issuing permits in suspectable cases.
The body was accordingly taken in charge
by the Coroner and conveyed to the
Morgue.
Dr. George Adam, whose office is room
149 Pbelan building, made the following
statement to a Call reporter yesterday
afternoon:
"I have been the family physician of the
Sheehan* for several years continuously.
On March 29, Miss Sheeban's brother
telephoned to me to go oat to the honse
and attend her, she being ill. I afterward
learned that it was against her express
wish that 1 had been called in.
"I found, on making an examination,
that she bad been sick for from five to
seven days before I vas called, ana that
decomposition had set in, cither from nat
ural causes or following a criminal opera
tion. I relieved the patient and she got
well in a few day* and was np and abont
for two weeis after that. After that pe
riod I was called again and found her dy
ing from peritonitis.
"When I saw that she was dying I
made her confess to her mother. She
said that she had been keeping company
with a conductor on the >illniore-street
cars and that he gave her $2 50 to go
downtown and see some physician. She
refused to tell me the name of tbe doctor
whom she went to see. She died on Sun
day morning, and the cause of her death
was probably flora catching cold after she
got up."
Dr. Gallagher performed an antopsy
yesterday Afternoon and found that peri
tonitis was the cause of deatb.
BACTERIA MAY KILL FLEAS.
Hopeful Speculations of a Kansas
Microbe Professor.
Professor George W. Bond of Leaven
worth, Kas., passed tbrongh the City yes
terday on his way to Los Angeles. Pro
fessor Bond has for many years made a
study of chinch bugs and like pests that
destroy crops.
"I think you might get rid of your flea
pest hero," he said last night, "just aa
we got away with the chinch bugs â
namely, by infecting them with lomi
kind of microbes that would destroy
them. You see. we spray our fields with
a harmless-looking fluid, but it is a
bacillus culture of a gelatinous nature,
and it contains enough germs to make a
whole field full of chinch bugs fatally 111.
In some such way you might discover the
bane for fleas and, by spraying a room]
with the material, drive them all into a
disease that would soon finish them."

The second day's session of the great
congress of women differed materially
from that of the opening day. It was a
restful session. Tne atmosphere of "un
settlednes-" hnd been dis.-ipated, and
visitors, members and officers alike en
joyed the peaceful culm begot of satisfac
tion and recognized success.
The>e were no "stars" to be introduced.
Mrs. Gardener did not appear till late in
the at:ernoon, and tne picturesque figure
of the Erahruacharin was missinc.
Tlie committee had fixed up a bit.
There were brjgh:, fresh flowers on the
stage, and that absence uf a suitable
'â¢background" that had worried the more
esthetic members was supplied by a grace
ful bunching of palms and the shining
leaves of tne rubier tree.
Many new faces were noticed in the au
dience, and none were missin.2. The new
comers were nearly all voting, pretty and
gay, lending to the session that touch of
essential iighines?, without which no
woman-gathering seems complete. Some
of the ladies in the audience were con
siderate enourh to remove their hats, and
many carried notebooks to jot down those
gems of thought that fell iroiu the lips of
the gified speakers.
Tiiere were a larger number of men
present than on the opening day, and
they contri bated a spirit of combativene-s
to the proceedings.
Mayor Phelan's paper especially aroused
them to action. While two arose to con
gratulate and comment, two others in
eloquent outburst? Dicked holes in his
theories and in turn tir >;>oanded ques

The Mayor advanced the theory that
closing tne avenues of one branch of in
dustry was invariably the means of open
ing another and frequently in a more re
munerative channel EL T. Mclver made
a strong ofjjectioi to this fashion of
reasoning, Â»r.d declared that it was wrong;
to oncourcge the youth to become artisan-.
for what work had we to offer Liie skilled
workman of to-day? "Wnat would we
have to offer the workmen of the future V '
Encouraging applause spurred Mclver on
to a more detailed discussion and rewarded
him at the close iur his noble, well-put
loijic.
Mrs. Swift, as on the opening day, did
the nonors of the convention with :i grace
ful tact. Each speaker was introaucea
with kindly courteous words that imme
diately established a feeling of sympathy
between lecturer and auditor.
In the morning there was no session.
The board of lady managers met and dis- '
cusseo. finances, and incidentally tlie sub
ject of providing a ball for Friday night.
Golden Gate llall is let for a dance on
Friday evening, and consequently it be
came a matter of securing another
meeting-place or of ppstponia* the Fri
day programme to Sunday. The latter
was finally decided upon.
While the ladies were deliberating the
many ladies interested in tlie congress
were auending a meeting of mothers at
the First Unitarian Church.
The exact purpose of the meeting was
set fonh 10 be to form an organization
"to unite all nersons, and especially
mothers, who wisn to keep in touch with
the new movement in child study; to
stimulate mothers to study their children
and educate themselves in the principles
ana facts that underlie the wisest child
training; to unite home and school ino:e
intelligently in the work of education ; to
make the kome a recognized educational
Institution, in line with the kindergarten,
the school and the university."
To-dny there will be three sessions,
morning, afternoon and evening.
THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS.
They Are Discussed at the
Woman's Congress. J; . .
The industrial arts occupied the atten
tion of the speakers at the Woman's Con
gress yesterday. Each Jecturer dealt with
the subject In that concise manner that
denotes a profound thinker and deep ob
lerver.
George Merrill was the first speaker in
troduced. His excellent paper was listened
to and solemnly applauded. Among other
things the gentleman sail:
" The man ual-tralning idea came to America
througn the Russian educational exhibit at
trie Centenn.al Exposition, I'hiludilphia,
1876. It whs first pui to test in the Massa
cuusette Institute of Technology. Its general
intioduction, however, was by means of cer
tain newly established institutions of higti
school grade. The St. Louis Ma:.ual Trninmg
School wan the first of its kind in America.
The development oi the inanual-training
idea from this earliest stage to its creaent
status presents various phases, of which the
following is a convenient synopsis:
â¢1. Multiplication of schools of the St. Louis
type and the extension of their programmes
to include courses for girls.
2. Extension of woodwork into the higher
erammar grades, and for ordinary grades
knifework exercises of American origin.
3. The Sloyd movement, ol Swedish origin.
4. The amalgamation of tooUvork, drawing,
sewing, cookery and the kindergarten into a
continuous graded course of ma-ual â¢ training,
or all grades from the kindergarten to college.
Manual training and trades schools have
little in common, except their equipments.
In methods, scope and purpose they are radi
cally different. Mnnual training has extended
its resources ereatly within ihe last few years.
It was originally a training, not in, but by
means of, or through the agency of, exercises
borrowed here and there from various indus
trial pursuits. It almn primarily to educate,'
not to give a knowledge per se of thiÂ» thing or
that thing, but simply to train and develop;
that is, to educate, in the ordinary and broad
est sen.-c of that term. It is a matter of the
acquisition of intellect' by means of in
struction in toolwork, drawing, seiving, cook
ery, or any other handworkâ â  it does not
matter whether this instruction is given in the
kindergarten, the common school or the high
school. In the trades school this discipline is
purely inciden ;if aimed at at all it is made
a matter of secondary importance. What is
Bought in the trades school is the acquirement
Of fckll; in the use of the materials, tools and
npphances that pertain to some one pursuit
Surely for the sake o: the dollars *nd cents to
be, acquired afterward from this particular
knowledge, In this cÂ«Â«e uxe uujuuctioa given
SPEAKERS AT THE WOMAN'S CONGRESS YESTERDAY.
is in itself the end nouglrâ an industrial end ;
in manual training, on the contrary, tne in
dustrial training serves on.y as a means to a
h:glierend â a means of educating. With this
difference Implied in its limitations, the ad
jective industrial is apjuied to both.
ihe extent to which manual training has
been incorporated in the course of study is
very different In different localities, but in
nearly every Instance it has won recognition
on purely pedagogical grounds. By this I
mean to say that it has been accepted* by edu
cators only alter it has sntisned their notions
of the tneory of educatiou. But with all this
it is a question whether it would have nad a
fair trial to show its pedagogical sounduess
hod ii not been barged up by the moral and
financial support of the general community,
which has not been altogether favorably dis
posed toward educational theories. There
was a time when schools were supposed to
exist tor the role purpose oi diffusing useful
knowledge. But nowaday-, this Is regarded
by educators as a ser-oudarv consideration;
with them the first thorght is the training
and development of the cnitd. And there is
the root of the co troversy between the
schoolmen and the more practical people.
The educational importance of a subject iÂ»
measured by its dis-ciplinary value; its eco
nomic iujpo:tnnce <iepen<is upon the amount
of useful knowledge ii contains. I'ntn the
advent of manual training the educational
tneory seemed iv trend more and more away
from economic considerations, and the com
mon-school curriculum became more iind
more a subject for adverse criticism, until
there seemea to be some truth in the parody
that defined a school as a plÃce for ''the con
fusion of useless knowledge."
In conclusion, it is the general consensus of
opinion among those most intimately con
cerned with the industrial affairs of the
American people that our schools should be
productive oi more practical results; that
through them an industrial instinct should be
developed as the predominant trait of Ameri
can citizenship. And in response to this de
mand I believe thftt the thtory of education
will witness a reversion to economic consider
ations. If it is the business of the schools to
moke citizens then the economic and educa
tional cannot be divorced. In many ways are
they affiliated, ana the closeness of this affilia
tion will increase rather than diminish, so I
am convinced that the present tendency
toward industrial education will continue at
an accelerated rate, and that Us progress will
lead to the introduction of an industrial ele
ment of some kind into every grade of tlie
common school.
By this I mean merely to point out the di
rection tn which we are trending; as regards
particulars of the conditions that will prevail
ten or twenty years hence I would not venture
too strong an opinion. Thus far the import
ance of industrial education has been urged
by extremists, and likewise it has been op
posed by extremists. Both Sides are right aud
both are wrong. Each proclaims the truth,
but not the whole truth. The major portion
ot the ola-time curriculum is valuable and
should be preserved aguinst all innovations;
but It is equally true that the industrial
branches have in them a large element of
good. In time the best of eacn will be ex
tracted and combined, and thus will there be
evolved a new education, the ultimate details
of winch It seems not in the power of the
human mind to predict, but surely it will
te&d to harmonize with the Industrial activ
ity that promises to be the ruling spirit of the
twentieth century.
Mayor Phelan followed Mr. Merrill.
Mrs. Swift introduced him by sayine:
"Our worthy Mayor, who always doe tne
graceful thing and says the wise one."
Mayor i'helan's address was as follows:
What interests men and women who are
hard at. work in a great city, in whose life and
whose development tney are wrapped up and
of which they become consciously or uncon
sciouÂ»v a part, is the industrial possibilities
of the place and what the luture holds. From
the beginning the peaceful destiny ot America
nas been its most, prominent characteristic.
Waen the Old Wond was torn wlih turmoil,
wars and social upheavals, blighted trade and
scattered commerce, America was looked upon
as the certain future field of the world's great
est industrial and commercial achievements.
It appeared, indeed, an inviting, field lor
man's enterprise aud industry, where he
could work without molestation. Napoleon,
after the cessiois of Louisiann, expressing a
sentiment which no doubt inspired him to
make favorable terms with Jefferson, ex
clttimed, "I have given to England a rival
which will sooner or later humble her prid-."
When the social fabric of France was shattered
and an exhausted people, drained of appar
ently every resource, stood with empty hands
us the gaunt. monuments of destroyed indus
tries, Carlyle, mocking Burkes words, said.
â¢The age of chivalry is gone and could not but
co, having now produced the still more in
domitable age of hunger." All eyes were
turned toward the New World. At that time
there were practically no manufactures. Life
was comparatively simple. Amusements were
few. Agriculture was the principal occupa
tion of the people.
But by degrees, with the growth of manu
factures, cities developed wonderfully in pop
ulation, numbers and extent, until the habit*
of the raco were changed and' the status of
man as a tool-using animal was re-established
on new lines. Machinery fostered thu new
tendency by cutting down the numbers en
gaged in and the remuneration paid for agri
cultural employment on the one hand and by
giving enormous scope to the manufncturlne
enterprises on the other. And those crianpes
are going on to-day. Men lose employment in
the cities by reason ot labor-saving devices,
and skilled mechanics have to learn n<- w arts
or. trades in order to subsist. While this
works great individual hardship in many in
stances, still it is â¢ometning that cannot and
will not be restrained, and which will ulti
mately, by cheapening the cost of production
and adding to the comforts of life, compensate
for apparent injury and loss. Another field
opens from the one that is closed. And yet it
Is hard to convince the disemploved man of
these lacts. In the lite of ; Benjamin Franklin
you will read' a curious story of how one
morning,' whilo Franklin was in London, ihe
King decided to wear bis own natural hair.
Up io lit tv time every genUemau wots a wig.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 28, 1897.
At once the wigmakers held a meeting and
petitioned his Majes;y to cease from wearing
nis own natural hair, because their trade
would be destroyed.
They enumerated the number of men
engaged in ii and said, as a filial
and conclusive argument, that in their
places French barbers and hair-dress
ers would come across the channel and
take the bread out of their mouths and the
shingles off their roofs. Now, what would
you have done in thai case? The King con
tinued to wear lv- natural hair, and every
gentleman in the land iollowed his example,
and the wigmakers lost their employment.
Km ma short lime the wiguiakers' sons be
came barbers ana hair-dressers, and lound a
more extensive employment, because whereas
a wig would last for a very long time the hair
of a man will grow and be in need of dress-
Ing. And probably in the limed Kingdom a
great deal more money was spent lor this rea
son in tne barber's chair t.,an formerly ever
had been spent in the wlgmaker's simp. So
men engaged in industrial employments may
be short-sighted in their demands, and re
cently 1 saw, to my surprise, that au axsovia
tioii (of the Brotherhood of Engineers aud
Trui.iiju-ii. 1 believe) petitioned the Legisla
ture of one of the Middle Western States* not
to reduce fares and irelghti because their
wages would possibly be reduced. Ido not
know w_hal the Legislature did, but 1 am sat
iMi<:l (hat if they reduced fares ana freight*)
the increased volume of business would com
pensaie for the loss which the petitioner! had
ituag ned woula ensue.
Jt is always a safe rule to consider the inter
ests of the greatest number in all these mat
ters, because, in case railroad fares and freights
are. oppressive, a man caunot get hia goods to
market, or, in gelling them to market, makes
a forced contribution to the common carrier,
which abs-'rbs his prolit and visits the com
munity with chronic depression and peren
nial hard times; and no employe is either
safely secure or rewarded in his employment
when- whole coinmuuities of men suffer from
a real grievance or wrong.
With these changing times, fashion inviting
and invention compelling change, there is no
certainly in employment unless a deep foun
dation in technical knowledge is laid, or a
man's versatility be broad and his adapta
bility to new conditions be easy. A man must,
in these days, be progressive and move with
the age iv which he lives. There is nothing
so staple that is not subject to the law
of change or to the exigencies of accident.
Yon will remember in â¢â¢Hamlet" how the two
oiu grave-diggers conversed. One propounds
the coiiundrum ; "What is he that builds
stronger than either the mason, the
shipwright or the carpenter?" Â»nd the answer
is, "The grave-digger, because the house tnat
tie makes lasts tin doomsday." That seemed
a good answer In Hamlet's time, but in our
modern cities we move even the graves of the
dead; cemeteries change their locations, and
even the grave-digger himself is superseded
by the fireman who attends the crematory.
Certainly c Â»c of the great duties of a well
ordered municipality thatabsorbsin its greedy
maw such vast populations, tempting the farm
er's boy irom his naiive fields, and bringing up
a progeny of its own which throng its streets, U
to keep everyone if possible well employed.
Tne trades unions limit the number of appren
tices in the industrial trades an: the hard lift;
of the seaman keeps the city bred boy a^ home.
Here employment on the sea has Its draw
backs, on the land its limitations. Now, the
city must overcome these limitations and
arawoacks. In this great port training-ships
should accustom the boys to the sea and teach
them the duties of a sailor, so that they wilt
ultimately take the piace of the hardened
jack tar (who is now ruled by brutality ana
lorce) and give the merchant marine service
ac^s of men worthy that fascinating and
venturesome, honorable and heroic vocation,
which in alt ages has been the forerunner and
thu ieeding stream of national prestige and
commercial supremacy.
Bui in order to have trade we must give as
well as receive, and the city that produces
nothing, nothing shall she get. Tne com
merce of San Francisco is with the islands of
the Pacific and the great Oriental shores be
yond, and their wantx we must studiously cul
tivase. Hut in order to compete in the mar
kets oi the world, we must produce the Dest,
or as good as the best, and in order to give
employment to our pecpie and bring wealth
to our community we cannot continue as we
have been doing, in purchasing goods made in
Germany and in France and iv England, or
continue to import skilled labor whenever any
manufacturing enterprise is projected. The
secret of the success of the great European
cities, among other things, consists very
larg.ly in something that we have not fos
tered, nor has any American community con
spicuously encouraged, and that is the estab
lishment of schools to give trade and vVshnl
chl education. When we mention the name
of Paris we at once conjure up in our imagina
tion everything that is dainty, beautiful and
arlistic, and looking for the source oi Parisian
success we at once see that even in the pri
mary schools manual training, ihe rudiments
of design and familiarity with tools are incul
cated.
From the primary school the pupil may go
ai 13 into h tr.u)c as au apprentice, and pro
vis, oa is made for the continuance of bis
studies either in the cvery-day classes or In
night schools. If he desires to"quuliiy for the
civil service of his country tnere are high
schools lor that purpose. It he goes in tor a
skilled trade, there ace professional colleges
to impart technical . knowledge, and tney all
bear directly on the trades which are profit
ably conducted in France." They teach work
in wood and iron and in the decorative arts
They teach chemistry and physics, iurnltur*
and upholstery, making printing, lithogra
phy, bookbinding, photography, photogravure
and muny new mechanical branches ot the re
productive arts. There are schools for girls in
which dressmaking and millinery and various
other industrial arts as well as domestic occu
pations are made the subject of patient care.
But the peculiarity of these schools is that they
teach tho.-e industries which are best adapted
to tne localities in which the, schools are es
tablished, as at Lille, in the north ot France,
for example, young men are trained in the
kDOwledce of the preat textile and mechanical
industries which thrive in that region.- And
what we say of France can also bÂ« said of Eng
land and itoiinuo. :,;â¢-.
In Glasgow trades schools directly promote
the shipbuilding, the cnemicnl and the tex
tile manufactures of the Ciyde valley. The
Manchester municipal technical schuols in
clude a great spinning and weaving sctiool, in
wnich everything pertaining to those indus
tries is taught in Â«uch a manner as 10 assure
the maintenance of Manchester's supremacy
in the textile industries A scnool ot art and
design aud several important schools of me
chanical arts and engineering and practical
tr Â»<H'S are also established.
The most recent authority on tnese subjects
says that England now fee.s that hhe hii6 louud
in technical education thu best f'>mi of protec
tion lor her industries. Certainly ;hÂ«i pro
tection which come- from the merit of the
artic.e itself, commanding a purenaser by 111
superiority, is h protection Hint Will be su

Tue complaint which has been jnÂ»de about
- our education is that it i- of such a character
| that it unfit* men for manual toil rather than
j qualifies iliein for it, and as productive or
I other mbor must be the lot of the vast lnajor
j ity of men, and a- i: |i desirable that ii be so
i iot the individual's owu good and for the ud-
I vonceinent and prosperity ot 'he country, the
â  character and form 01 education become a
; matter of most vital importance to the welfare
:01 city and State. The CniverÃiiy of Caliior
nia was the recipient of land grants condi
tional upon its devotinK a iarge part of its
workâ wnich it is doingâ to the application ot
: scientific knowledge to the commercial, agri
cultural and manufacturing employments.
The Lick School in Franci.-co, with a
I small capacity, it is true, is working on these
hues, and recently, oy the death of two
| philanthropists, J. fc. WilmtTdiuK Â»"d Charles
j Lux, other schoois of a similar cintricier win
be provided, and hence the future gives
glimmeriugs 01 promiso But the munici
pality is doing practically nothin:;. Iv your
lime probably there were no facilities to ac-
i quire a knowledge of a trade or a profession or
an art in schoo-s where men are uncon
sciously guided and where young bo.M and
girls apply themselves to studies in the selec
tion of which they have no choice, and hence
probably you received a general education,
which, whiit* extremely desirable i:i itseli, is
not inconsistent with the knowledge of some
useful handicraft, trade or profession, winch
would be a delight and a pleasure, a ready
means of livelihood and a substantial coutri-
Dutlon to tin: wealth and prosperity of the
place in which you live.
The productive industries of a community
yield the best returns. It is the -nan. who
makes the blade of grass grow where none
grew before, who creates something uselul or
beautiful out of the crude material, who is in
the best sense a benefactor. Toward such
benefaction ii is possible for every man to
contribute, no matter what may be his means
or his condition. Tne producer cannot stand
a. one. In every scheme of industrial employ
ment there is provision made, even by the
cold political economist-, lor the wages of
superintendence. Yet the farmer in the in
terior calls the merchant of San Francisco ths*
toll-gatherer ut the gate. The producer looks
with suspicion, never appreciating their value,
upon what he calls the middlemen ; but the
middlemen are as necessary a part of the <-con
omic machine as the producer himself. What
avails production unless that which is pro
duced in exchanged for something of value, I
and the producer cannot boih produce and
become his own agent in the markets of the
world, which is properly the Held of com
merce and trade. Sovr every man who is en
gaged m the store or shop or the commercial
house who aids in bringing the buyer and the
seller together performs a vital and im
portant function, and his employment Is just
as honorable ana just as useful as any other.
The hopes ot mankind have not been disap
pointed in America. She has vindicated her
destiny of peace. Wide acres and weak neigh
bors have made the task easy.
She has given dignity to labor and destroyed
the false pretensions of the "age of chivalry."
Not only is :abor made honorable, but every
honorable American seeks, rather than shuns,
labor; and every community skould see that
the labor of its citixens Is made uÂ«â lul. and be
directed into channels which will be the most
remunerative to the man and the most advan
tageous to the State.
These are the tendencies of the times, and
let us hope thai out of them great good win
come; and that the hero of the futme will not
necessarily be "the man on horseback" â not
alone the man who on occasions fights for his
country, but he who, in whatever capacity he
may be employed, whether it be afoot or
ahorse, makes his country worth lighting fur.
After Mayor Pbelan's paper, which
caused considerable discussion, Mrs. Eva
V. Carlin was introduced. Her paper on
"Child Labor" waa in part as follows:
The air is full of new cries for the better
ment of human life; there is a sound of the
gmhering ana remarshaling ol new .orces and
the reorganization of oid oik-s, impelling all
practical, sweei-soulea humanity to remedy
the present social situation, and tnere is no
â¢â¢all mi instant und relevant as that raided in
the Interest of wage-earning chi.dhood. The
problem of the children is the problem of tne
State. In child-saving lies social redemption:
in childhood's freedom is unfolded the life of
the future freedom of the race.
"Saturday's child must work for its living,"
and the fact that thousands ol children en
gaged in continuous toil Â»nd deprived of ail
that makes UJe happy is accepted as the in
evitable sentence, from which there is no
escape. Need put* the child to work when he
should be at school. His labor causes low
wages for adults, thus increasing the need
and greed ol parent*, and employers complete
tne injustice. Ctlifornlii nnows children to
be employed ten hours per day, and the num
ber of such toilers ia on the increase among
Professor Elmer E. Brown brought the
aiernoon session to a clo-e by his paper
on "Technical Schools of California."
Among other things Professor Brown
said:
We are a Nation of idealists. Our pnblic
school system ig evidence of our idealism,
hren those who insist that our education be
made more practical insist that first of all
It shall oe broad and liberal. It Is a great
thing for our democracy that it has had this
insight.
But there ia another aspect of our education
which is not so generally understood, but is
worthy of the most serious consideration. It
may be stated in the tormof a nrinciplo sup
plementary to that broad and libeial idea of
our education. 1 may venture 'o elate that
principle in the fjliowing words: Public edu
cation in each of ita main divisions should
terminate in the mastery of some occupatiou
in lite.
The of the paper was occu
pied with the exposition of this principle
and its application to California condi
tions.
EVENING SESSION.
Two Speakers Held the Audience
Spellbound Until the Close.
Woman, lovely woman and otherwise,
married and single â mostly single, but
self-reliant and independent; intellectual,
sympathetic, refined, non-giggling women
for the greater part; the new woman of
brain and bravery to solve life's problems
and to battle with life's ills, filled every
inch of aittmg room during the evening
session.
Miss Kitherine Felton read a paper on
the subject, "The Importance to Women
?*j a knowledge of Economic Laws and
industrial Conditions," and her tieat
ment of the subject was all that couid be
desired, although the nine-year-old sta
tistics quoted by her would hardly apply
to the prauont industrial condition brought
abont by the increased output of labor
saving machinery.
Miss Pelton devoted considerable time
to the discussion of the matter of the en
croachment by women upon tue domains
of labor hitherto man's own. Their com
petition in certain lines had reduced
wages, and men had been forced to accept
like wages or abandon their work.
There was, however, one notable excep
tion â the Lancashire weavers, who took
women into their union* and demanded
for them the sarue wages that were being
paid to the men.
The speaker quoted from the statistics of
Carroll D. Wri^-iu of the Depnriment of
Labor, which statistics were collated in
1888. to illuminate certain dark problems
of the labor is-Â«ue. Inquiry of 17,47*2
women, textile workers, brain workers
and domestic servants excluded, gavo the
average a?e at 22 years ana 7 months,
showing that tbe working women in our
great cities are working girls. Of the
i whole number only 745 were married and
living with their huÂ»bMnd<;.
Tue average atre of 1032 working women
in Boston was 24 years, only seven of
whom were married, not including
widows, but including those who bad
been separated iroin their husbands. In
1889 of the working women of Massa
chusetts two-thirds were under 30 years
old and only 11 per cent married, includ
ing widows.
It appears from these old statistics that
married women formed but an insignii
| cant proportion of the whole numbe en
gaged In work, aud that tbe number of
married men permanently displaced by
women had not increased.
Women Â«eemed destined to take the
routine mental work, and m-n would have
to seek for something hgher. As the
introduction ot machinery had been con
ducive to the weii being of society, so
would the introduction of woman into the
field of labor be conducive to that end
likewise.
Helen Gardiner, the popular authoress,
whose works breathe the spirit of the
newer and the freer age. was intro
duced l>v the chairwoman. Miss Gardiner's
appearance is not at all suggestive of blue
stocking". On t c contrary, -he is a sweet
faced, swee. -voiced little woman, all gold
and no brass. Her manner suggests the
proverbial modeitrof merit.
She began by taking issue with Miss
Felton's statement that women were not
and would not be successful as civil en
gineers. It happened to be a matter of
knowledge with her that one of the great
est engineering feats ever performed in
the world was by a woman, the deÂ« ; ening
and construction of the Brooklyn Brmge.
It was not generally known that a woman
did it. The man who undertook the task
b-oke down and lost his sight, and all the
mathematical work and calculation and
engineering were done by a woman. It
was not wise to tell it at the time, bat it
was a fact.
It was not wiÂ«e at the time to tell that
Miss Carroll of Maryland planned Grant's
campaign in Tennessee, but Grant ad
mitted that such was the fact. Had it
been announced at the time it was feared
that the soldiers would not have had con
fidence in the plun of campaign and that
this lack of confidence would have had a
very bad effect.
A large part of the most skillful work
of the great New York Aqueduct was
done by a woman.
This ended Miss Gardener's little talk,
and then a most d stressing thing hap
pened. A poor male of middle age, a
demi-brunetie, arose out of a cloud of
women in the rear of the hall and asked
whether the woman who did the work for
the Brooklyn bridge was not the wife of
the engineer who weut blind, and whether,
if that were true, it should not redound to
the mati'i! glory.
There was a smile on the face of the
wretched man as he asked the que-tion.
Hia manner was respect:ul and deferen
tial, 'is it should be, but his presumption
in daring to ask the question of a Woman's
Congress was met with a thousand
pouud horsepower Icy glare from the of
ficer? on the stage which put him on cold
storage. Nobody noticed the miserable
wretch and he was left to take what con
solation he could out of a few gipglesfrom
n knot of good-looking young women who
bad never attended a Woman's Congress
before.
Professor Henry T. Ardley of Berkeley
wa- the next speaker, ill's subject was
"Art in Industry," and bis remarks were
illustrated with a big portfolio of draw
ings, colored and in b.ack and white.
The professor's lecture was really three
lectures condensed into one, and the hour
and a haf allotted to him was really too
short for the scope of tbe subject.
He spoke of decorative art and illus
trated the manner in which natural ob
jects, particularly flowers and foliage,
were conventionalized so as to conform to
the laws of dual symmetry, and to tit the
panel, the vase or the fame which they
were designed to fill. His hearers were
surprised to learn la.it $7,000,000 was sent
out of this country last year for designs
made in Europe for decorative purposes.
This money should have been earned by
American men and women. England,
France and Germany were filling our
stores with drapery, china and jewelry
that should be made at home.
The Br*t atep toward a knowledge of de
signing is iree-hand drawing, and it
should be taught in all our schools. One
dues not have to be borne an artist in or
der to learn to draw, nor must one be
born a ooet to learr. to write. After free
hand drawing come designing and historic
ornamentation.
Geometry, nature and history are the
subjects of designs. Designs are often the
outgrowth of accident, and contrast, repe
tition and symmetry were the essentials.
In iron pyrites, crystallized quartz and
snowtlakes could be tound every geomet
rical design t-ver made or that ever would
be made by the hand of man.
Stress was laid upon the value of tan
gential curves. The Egyptians 3000 years
ago understood this principle, and as
proof of thia statement the lecturer ex
nibited the picture of a conventional
papyrus plant carved at that time.
Copies of designs on Greek vase*, mosa
ics from Pompeii, designs from the Al
bambra and examples of the Rococo style
which marked the decadence of the Re
naissance, and wnicn would give the
spectator the delirium tremens to look
upon, were exhibited.
At the close of the evening session the
chairwoman announced that Dr. Beecher

HARDINGER'S LUCK.
He Gets Rich Placer Sllnos in the Can

Chile.
P. de Miranda, one of the owners of the
steamer Madeleine, now in nort, and own
ing interests in larue oil wells in Peru,
who is nt the Palace, kas received a letter
from a personal friend in Chile, which
s>ays that Mr. Hardinger, long interested in
oil wells at Los Angeles an d elsewhere,
has made a big gold discovery in Chile.
"It is at Cuzco, in the Carabaya S.india
placer district in the department of Puno,
in the interior, or rather away from tha
coast," soid Mr. de Miranda. "His mines
are placer, too, and are said by my cor
respondent to be phenomenally rich.
Mr. Hardinger is well known, not only in
Mm .Krancisco, but in other parts of Cali
fornia. Ue operutod in oil for a long time
at Los Angeles.
"Thousands of men have for some time
past been leaving lquique to go to these
goldmines. lquique is very duli. Noth
ing almoÂ»t iÂ« being done in the nitrate
business. There were from 40,000 to 45,000
workmen having their headquarters in
lquique and about there, anu many of
these neve left Jor the gold mines. Thou
sands are leaving now. There is a big
excitement tijere.
"Some half dozen big English syndicates
are operating in the Carabaya Sandia dis
trict. There appears to be lots of gold
there."
Mr. de Miranda's steamers operate on
the west coast and carry oil from his
we!lÂ°, which are at Grau, in the province
of Tumbez, Peru.

Great strides are being made in Ger
many in the way of applying machinery
to many lines of industry.
But perhaps most remarkable of all is
j the application of dynamos to agriculture
; supplying the three elements of heat'
light and productive energy, as well as
labor. :-.*:/.â ,
On one of the new electric farms a tur-Â»
bine drives a dynamo which lights the
barns, yards and dwellings, and furnishes
a current of low tension to work pumps
run straw-cutter, lathe, grindstone, large
handsaw and thrashing-machine. One
machinist attends to the entire plant
which experience proves hns reduced the 1
expenses of the farm in considerable de
gree. ;.â¢;;.:
This new method of farming has already
displaced labor to an extent that is mak
ine farm laborers very anxious. Not only
<loe? the "electric farmer" coinnete dis
astrous y with the old-tinier, but the elec
tricity so stimulates the growth of his
crops by night that he reaps a double ad
vantage. -; - j

Four Choices Over the
Line First at Ingle
side.
Caesarian Da'eated a Trio oi
Speedy Oaes in Fast
Time.
Mis> R m en Finally Scored Brackets-
Imp Trance, With Bergen Up,
Bat St. Aignoa a Nose.
The weather was cold and the sport
dull and uninteresting at Inpleside yester
day. The attendance was fair, and as
four favorites led their company past the
wire, the books, with few exceptions, quit
behind on the day's speculating.
The best race of the afternoon from a
time standpoint was the six-furlong
sprint, with Zamar 11, Cresarian, Tor
sina and Vinctor as starters. Caesarian
was a 7 to 10 favorite, and, passing Zamar
af ;er a quarter had been covered, led that
sprinter out a neck in 1:135Â£. Torsina
w.is a poor third.
Miss Remsen caDtured the opening four
and a iialf furlong scramble for two-year
olds, going to the post at odds of 6 to 1.
H. Brown sent her out in front, and at the
end sne won, hard ridden, a neck in front
of the 5 to 2 favorite, Front de BoGuf,
whicn was shut off on one or two occa
sions and should have won.
Pat Dunne's gelding Tulare scored an- ]
other win in the niiie Felling run. With
Willie Martin up he was heavily played i
at odrtÂ« o! 4to 5. and won rather easily j
irom Nebuia. heating the Brutus filly a
neck in L:42JÂ£. Inflammator, at 15 to 1, :
was a good thud.
The third event on the card, at seven
furiongs, decided underselling conditions,
was easy for the 4 to f> choice Montallade,
carrying B. C. Holiy's colors. Slaughter, !
who had the mount, allowed Blue Bell
and Kicardo to make the running into the
sireien, where the favorite assumed the
lead and won, easing up, with Blue Bell
taking the place, two lengths bsfore Trap
pean.
Refugee looked to have struck a soft
soot in the eeven furlong selling event
next decided, but Kowalsky after trailing
h:ni for nearly half the distance shot to
the front an 1 in a hard drive defeated the
on choice a head in 1:23)^. The
winner, ridden by Stevens, was klO to 1
tbance in the betting.
The Jinal race on tha card, over one
rj:iie and a furlong, resulted in a very
c ose finish between the 6 to 5 choice imp.
Trance and the 10 to 1 shot St. Aignon.
The latter horse cut out the pace and was
only beaten through Marty Bergen on
:!:e favorite outfinishine H. Brown, who
i iloted the outsider. Peter the Second
linished in the show.
NOTES.
Saai Hildreth was not very much pleased I
at Piggott's handling of Refugee. Other j
people have been afflicted the same way
at the performances of horses trained by
Hildreth when their runs called for no
complaint from the owner.
Ey Holly thought the one his horse
Montallade bad to beat was Trappean.
The latter has been working well of late, i
but hardly ran up io early morning form. '
Little Stevens rode an excellent race i
asiride Kowalsky as far as good judgment I
was concerned. He has still considerable
to learn, but is young yet.
It was reported that Earl Cochran had
been sent over the wires to Eastern play
ers. Many here wished after the last race
the horse liad been sen; along also with
Hie message.
On Saturday next there will be a special
purse of $750 hune up lor a mile race and

leged pulline of the borse Governor iiudii, |
a3O to 1 shot in the betting, was yester
doy reiiisttited by the stewards at Ingle
side. There is not the slightest doubt but
that the suspension of Martinus was an
unjust one, and the cleverest rider in this
part of the country bas been compelled to j
stay on the ground all this time. It is
claimed that Mnrtinus is an honest rider
and that this fact did not suit well a
"push" which has virtually controlled
and directed, both in weights and condi
tions, the jumpine-horse game at Ingle
side. In substantiation of this statement
comparison is called to the races of the
horse Governor Budd both belore and
since the rider's suspension.

TURNED ON THE GAS.
A Thief Robbed LouUa Warren and
Alniont Caused Her to Be
Asphyxiated.
Louisa Warren claims to have been
robbed of $900 worth of diamond rings
and other jewels while she was asleep. In
consequence she has caused the arrest of
Nellie Martell on a charge of grand
larceny.
It appears from the complainants' state
ment that both women met casuall on
! Monday and after drinsiug many times
I Louisa Warren felt com pelled to lie down
in her room for a few brief moments.
She says that the Martell woman took
, advantage of her condition to despoil her
! of her valuables.
The case came up before Police Judge
i Campbell yesterday morning and Trent
! over until next Friday. â¢
The detectives are investigating the
case, as a charge of attempt to murder is
under consideration.
When the Warren woman was found in
her room, despoiled of her valuables, lour
gasjets were fully turned on and the room
j was so fully charged with gas it is a won
der she was able to crawl to the push
button and get assistance.
The polite believe that the thief,
whether the prisoner in charge or some
one else, proposed to murder the woman
j a3 well as to rob her of her diamonds.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, DAY, APRIL 28, 1897.
THE FOUNDATION
Professor Soule's Report
on the Aifiliated
Colleges.
University Regents Talk of
New Buildings and In
surance.
McKilliken Retains.! as Inspector.
Ju!ge Foote Hits Free Trade
a Heavy Whack.
The foundation of the Affiliated Col
leees is all right.
That is the opinion of Professor Frank
SoiUe of tne University of California, and
his report was Lauded in at the meeting
of the university regents held yesteraay
afternoon at the llopkins Institute of Art.
He was appointed to do this at the last
meeting, and his favorable report lifted a
great weight off the minds of the regents.
Processor Soule stated that iv accord
ance with instructions ne had carefully
examined the foundation â the concrete
part especially â on April 16, and on April
21 he had hired iwo stonemasons and
sounded the walls for weak spots in
twenty different places. As a result they
were found substantial and solid in all
parts. Though large holes had been chis
eled in them they were found to be in a
solid state, notwithstanding that they are
so new.
The concrete beneath the walls, reached
by excavation in ten different places, was
found to be well mixed and there were no
voids. The stone, gravel and cement were
good. It id not yet perfectly hard, but
will become so in time.
The profes-or was not quite satisfied
with the sand that had been used. He be
lieved it contained too mucti earth and
thi3 might have a tendency to retain
dampness. In spite of this fact, however,
he believes the foundation sa:e and able
to stand a vastly greaser amount of pres
sure taan wouJd ever be required of it.
Regent Houghton stated his gratification
that the foundation had been found essen
tially good. Ue Mad been on the site and
examined it himself several times and was
entirely satisfied that no fault could be
found.
Then the question arose of selecting Su
perintendent Robert McKilliken as the
official inspector of buildings oi the uni
versity. Governor Budcl did not believe
the fund would permit it, but believed
that he might receive, his money out of
the university fund. After some discus
sion Regent Foote c.ive it as his opinion
that the board had authority to do thi-, if
it saw nr, and by unanimous vote McKil
liken was selected as such superintendent
and inspector, witn salary fixed at $159 a
month, payment to date ironi the time of
his service.
The question which caused the most
j heated consideration of the session was a
I proposition re,ad by President Kellogg,
â¢ which emanated from Professors String
ham and Rising of the University. Their
suggestion was that a communication be
sent Senators vVhite and Perkins, re
{ questinc them to use their influence
j against any tariff being placed on books
I and apparatus imported lor scientific pur
! poses.
Regent Foote was on his feet in an mi
i stant. He did not believe in free trade in
\ any particular and would vote against
j such a proposition on general principles,
j Governor Buud voiced his sentiment)
J that the members of the board might use
their influence in this direction as in
' divtduals if not otherwise. Regent Foote
; replied that the Governor's power was
' pretty strons, but he himself was not in
, side the walls of San Quentin yet and
; v.ould express his opinion the same now
â  as ever; that it was bad for the Univer
i sity to take any stand that would make it
i appear to tnke tides with any politi
! cal party, and he would "ri,'ht it out on
: that line all summer," if necessary.
Regent Reinstein was of the same
I opinion, inasmuch as he believed it would
I appear as if the university was taking
j sides on a political question. The matter
j was dropped without coming to a vote.
, It was here moved that the board go into
executive session to consider the question
of raising the salaries of professors at the
university, but Jud&e Wallace did not be
! lieve an executive session necessary for
such a purpose. He thought there was no
necessity of hurrying in such a matter as
that anyway. Regent Rodgers thought
i otherwise, and wanted the question dis
-1 posed of at once.
President Kellogg was asked if any of
; the professors had demanued a raise of
i salary, and replied that they had. He
j iurther volunteered the information that
the raises contemplated meant only $4900
j additional expense. This question, to
i gether with the securing of new instructor*
; in added branches, d'd not reach a definite
', conclusion and will be disposed of later.
A report from the Academic Senate
recommending that a degree of bachelor
of sciences and medical doctor be conferred
on students after completing a three
years' course was referred to the commit-
I teo on internal administration.
A petition from the College of Physi
cians and Surgeons and one lrorn "the
Cooper Medical College, making similar
requests, were referred to the same com
mittee.
The general proposition of insuring
university property, after a lengthy argu
ment, was referred to the committee on
law and legislation. The question of hav
ing an inventory taken of State University
properties was referred to the same body.
When the question of putting up tem
porary buildings to replace the loss of the
agricultural building came up, Regent
Pnicke put himself on record as oppos
ing lite construction of a single hie "lire
box," and wanted several smaller ones
buut instead. Tue contractor was on
band and believea that what was required
could be built for $6000. ihe proper com
mittee was given charge of the matter.
This committee, which also has in charge
the matter of erecting the temporary
buildings rendered necessary by over
crowding, had its limit of expenditure
raised from $33,000 to $40,000.
The sum of $250 was ordered appro
priated for the expense of defraying the
expenses of commencement day .May 12,
the exercises to be held in Berkeley.
Some di<cussion arose over the proposi
tion to build a reservoir at the university
for use m case of tire. It will probably be
sealed at the next meeting.
it was further decided to improve the
ineeting quarters of the board in the Hop
kins Institute of Art building. New mat
ting will be laid, tables and chairs placed
in the committee-room and a stove and
fuel provided.
The board then went into executive ses
sion, <luring which the apportionment of
the 50 per cent additional of the 1 cent
tax levy appropriated at the last session
of the legislature was referred to tbe joint
committee on finance and internal admin
istration.
OFF FOE HAMBURG.
California Will Be Well Represented at
the German Kipoai t inn.
J. A. Filcner, manager of the State Board
of Trade and recently appointed by Gov
ernor Budd as one of the commissioners
to represent the State at the Hamburg
International Exposition in Germany,
will leave tor Hamburg to-day or at
the end of tne week. He sakes the place
of Charles Edelman, resigned. Tbe other
commissioner* are Robert Hecto of New
castle, .PJac r County, and Henry Forte
man of the Alaska Pack ne Company.
Several carloads of California products
of all kinds have beeu forwarded and more
will follow soon.
It is Mr. Filcher's purpose to artistically
install these exhibits and then retcrn, at
Mr. Hecto will relieve him. Mr. Filches
wilt be absent several weeks. A near
pamphlet is being prepared in the Ger
man and English languages, descriptive
of California's industries and the products
of the State. It will contain many recipes
for the preparation of food from t ie fruits.
The last Legislature appropriated $tiooo
and the counties are adding to that
amount in order that the Stale shall be
properly m resented. The transportation
of the goods is free.
TIRE IN A LUMBEfi-YABD.
The Department Called Out Twice to
Extinguish Burning Timber,
A second-hand lumber-yard at 1166
Mission street, owned by J. O'Connor,
gave the fire department considerable
trouble last evening. At 5:30 o'clock
flames broke out in one of the piles of
lumbar and an alarm was sounded
through box 183. After half an hour's
labor the flames were extinguished and
tne engines returned to tbeir houses.
At 8 o'clock in the evenim; the lumber
was again found to ba in flames and an
other alarm was sounded. This time the
lumber was thoroughly drenched and
every lurking spark extinguished.
The cause of the first tire is enknown.
It is presumed that the socond was
caused by a bit of wood left smoldering
from the first tiro. The loss will not ex
ceed $150.
GANS AND LEONARD MEET
The Fighters Foregather at the
Olympic Club and Sign
Articles.
Parson Davies Left for the East L st
Evening With Barry and
Armstrong.
Quite a lar;;e gathering of pugilists and
the admirers of lighting men met on
Monday afternoon in the Olympic Club to
converse on matters pugilistic.
Among the distinguished ring genera's
were Joe Gans, the colorrfd champion
lightweight of Baltimore, and his
manager, All King; Mike Leonard, the
swell-dressed pugilist of New York, who
13 to meet Gans in a passage-at-arms on
the evening of May 18 at Mechanics' Pa
vilion; Jimmy Barry, the cbampion ban
tam-weight pugilist of America; Lon Ag
new, the clever exponent of the game of
hit and miss; George Green, the local
welter-weight, and the crack amateur
sprinters, F. Foster and H. M. Collins.
Superintendent Billy Kennedy was to
have put in on appearance at 2 o'clock,
according to an agreement ho had entered
into with Alf King, but it was past -1 p. m.
wheu Kenuedy and his quasi amiie ar
rived.
"You will excuse me, gentlemen, " said
Kennedy, addressing the pugilistic in
vaders who were awaiting his coming, "I
have just arrived from the Seal Rock
House, where Baker Qas been training :or
the past week. I lound it necessary to
change liis training quarters and climate
as the attractions were too numerous and
too warm for him out by the sea, you
know. He ia now located at Bianken's
six-mi!e-house rendezvous, at which place
h<- will complete his training for his con
test with Jeffries.
"I must keep an eye on those fellows,"
remarked the boxing matcii maker of the
Olympic, "or they will give us a jolly
wliicu we can't stand, you know."
Leonard is a most iasniouably dressed
fellow. He would pans in any company
fbr a bank clerfc or a university stuuent.
He changes dress three times a day and
contends that a pugilist who can earn a.
few thousand a year by the power ot his
lists has just as much right to dress
'swell" and look lovely as a dry-goods
clerk who earns $600 a year.
Leonard and Guns left yesterday for
their respective trailing stations. The
iorraer will "rusticate" at the Seal Hock
House, and the colored champion will
bas-punch under tne watchful eve of his
manager, Al King, at the Terrace baths in
Alameda.
Gans said that he was not bound flown
by a contract to remain under the
instructions of his old manager, Al Her
ford, for any definite time, and that in
future he will be managed by his present
handler A! King, whom he thinks a good
money-maker.
Steve O'Donnell, who is matched to
fight Greggains under the auspicao of the
Olympic Club in June, will arrive next
week. The boxing committee of the club '
is now n^urinj on a bout between McCoy '
and Creedon, but this match will entirely
defend upon the financial success of the
Mmv entertainment.
"Parson" Davies and his stable of
lighters, viz. : Jimmy Barry and Bob Arm
strong, wnl leave for New YorK this even
ing. Mr. Davies is very anxious to be at
tue ringside when Choynski will meet
Denver Ed Smith. Davies has an interest
in Choynski's welfare and for that reason
he will be on hand to instruct his man
when a few words of good advice are
necessary.
According to a diÂ«r-atch from New York
the managers of Peter Maber and Tom
Sharkey met the representatives of one of
>iew York's sporting clubs yesterday and
accapted a proposition for a light between
the principals for a $10,000 purse, to take
place some date to be hereafter arranged
between May -â¢> aud Jane 10.
Al King says that it would be almost
impossible to get Tommy Ryan, "Spike"
Sullivan and many o;hei riphters of note
to journey to this City. "You see, ail
thoae fellows play favorite to some of the
Eastern clubs, which are run more for
politics than anything eise. Ryan will
not light outside of Syracuse, aud Sulli
van is the pet of a New York club, which
has him under its thumb.
â¢'By the way, this fellow Sullivan is a
curiosity. He has something like $6000
in bank, and of course is as independent
as tne proverbial hoe on ice. He will not
tight any man unless he is conn lent of
whipping him. He sÂ»lects his own game,
and wheu the whim catches him he will
go forth on the hunt for a good thing.
Finding some fellow, suitable to his
lancy. 'Spike' will immediately open
tire on him in this wise: "Say, I want to
fight youâ see; are you ready to siga
articles in so and so's club?'
"If the pug who is challenged on sisht
refuses to accept the offer Sullivan threat
ens to have him roasted in the papers,
and as a rnrting shot he 'yanks' from biÃ
inside pocket his bankbook, which speaks
for itself. He also carries a checkbook
purposely to "write out a check' in case a
side bet is necessary, and he tears up
dozens of checks daily just for the fun of
the tning. Ha ia the most erratic char
acter I have ever met, and rather than ex
pend 25 cents for a square meal he lives
on the cheapest food obtainable."
MISSION BUEGLAES.

F. Hess, 3225 Twenty- first street, and his
wife left home last nigbi about 7 o'clock.
When they returned about two . Hours
later they found that the bouse had been
entered during their absence and thor
oughly ransacked.
The only thine they found ruiÂ«sing was
a plain gold rim;, but it was apparent that
the burglars had been scared away; as
â¢everai articles iia i been se ected for car

DIDN'T WIT TO
BE VACCINATED
Two Venturesome Runners
Operated On at Angel
Island.
Boarded an English Bark Ee
fore Either of the Quar
antine 0 ficers.
Days Crowley Jr and J.m^s Sennstt
Will Not Forget Their Expe
rience in a Hurry.
Dave Crowley Jr. and James Sennett
will lone remember the arrival of the
British bark Sumbawafrcm Hongkong.
The vessel was from an infected port and
the Custom-house officers would not allow
anybody ashore until the quarantine
officeis had passed upon the crew. Even
Pilot Fred Malliieson bad to remain ou
boar i all night.
After the customs launch had left the
bark Crowley and Sennett launched their
boat and went out to her. They were
soliciting orders for the Go:den Shore
Market and thought to steal a march on
the opposition. They succeeded in get
ting aboard end were busy taking an
order when the customs boat steamed
alongside again. Some one at Meig.s
wharf had told Boarding Officer Sprague
about the trip of the two young men and
he determined to catch them.
Sprague succeeded. Crowley and Ben
nett were seated in the cabin when
Sprague entered and placed them both
under arrest. They were placed on board
the Hartley and tak- n to Angel Island,
where they spent the nigh tin quarantine.
Yesterday they were stripped and bathed,
next they were put in the tank and fumi
gated, and lastly they were vaccinated.
Their clothes were thoroughly fumigated
end then they were sent ashore on the
quarantine boat Siernberg, sadder but
wiser y oung men.
'*I don't care a continental about being
kept in quarantine all Bight, because I got
an order out of Captain Garner," said
Dave Crowley. "Neither did I mind be
ing washed and fumigated, but I made a
most vigorous kick when they started in
to vaccinate me. Why, hang the thing,
1 was vaccinated when I was a youngster,
and why did " they want to do it over
again? Now, in two or three days I'll
have an arm like & boiled lobster, and I
suppose it will be a week before Sennett
and I are able to row a boat again. I sup
pose if the Marathon came in from Hong
kong to-nigut and I went aboard her be
fore the quarantine oiiicer they would
yank me over to Angel Island and vacci
nate me again."
It is safe to say. however, that neither
Sennett nor Crowley will board the Mara
thon until both Dr. Bleu and Dr. Chal
mers have passed her.
The Sunibawa had a fair weather pas
sage up to the 9th inst. On that date sue
ran into very heavy weather. A succes
sion of westerly to southwest gales, with
squalls, were encountered. The thunder
and ligntning were continuous and there
was a very high confused sea. Sails were
blown out of the bo'.t ropes and the sliip
labored heavily. Some of the men were
washed into the scuppers, but were res
cued by their comrades Defore they were
seriously injured. Captain Garner says it
was one of the heaviest gales he has en
countered in many a day.

know what was the matter with me. * My husband went to our family physi-
cian and described my. symptoms, and he said I had displacement and falling
of the. womb. He sent me some medicine, but it did little good. I let it go
on about two years, and every time I did any hard work my womb would
come down. Finally a lady friend advised me to try Lydia E. Pinkham
Vegetable Compound, which I did. The first bottle helped me so much, I con-
tinued to take it right aiong. My back was almost the same as no back. I
could not lift scarcely any weight. My life was just a drag to me. To-day
I am well of my womb trouble, and have a good, strong back, thanks to

A LECTURE ON ART.
Dr. William R. Alger Speaks at the
Hopkins Institute.
Dr. William R. Alger delivered an inter
esting ieeture on art at the Hopkins Art
Institute yesterday afternoon, the audi
tors being chiefly women.
The speaker put sculpture as an older
art than architecture, contrary to the usu
al idea. After architecture he placed
painting as the third of tha arts, then
music, uext poetry and finally acting.
The seventh and highest of all arts he
named a* "the formation of character
and the conduct of life."
"The lirst three arts are silent," he said,
"and the lirst to speak is music, which
cannot be toucued or 3sen, yet an orches
tra is a transcendent personality and sugÂ«
crests vast experiences. There are thinps
in Beethoven that humanity will first ex
perience a thousand years hence."
The speaker thought the drama the
highest of all the arts snve ttiat which be
called the conduct of life.

A Wild Man at Haywards
Is Now Being Pursued
by Hunters.
Approached a Lady's House and
Demanded a White Robe
of the Cook
After Hii D m nJ W.s Satisfid He
R?n Througj tie Town and
Disappeared.
Oakland OrricE Sax Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, April 27. \
' A genuine wile man of the wildest kind
is at this time roaming the hills back of i
Haywardi att red in nothing, but an ordi- j
nary sheet. He made his escape last night,
and it was thought that the bitter weather
and the cold wind of tho last twenty-four !
hours vould have forced him to seek shel- ,
ter before this time, but he is apparently
insensible to personal inconvenience and
desires lo roam the hills.
Last evening about 6 o'clock an mdi- ',
vidual, who was undoubtedly crazy, went
into Hay wards Park and divested himself I
of his clothing. He carefully roiled it up ,
and put it in a little hut whereiu are kept
the keeoer'a tools and then started to 'â 
Walk toward an adjoining house. i
Mrs. Hastings and lira. Qarretson, who â 
conduct the hostelry near the park, saw j
an uncanny object among the trees aad â 
Bent the Chinese cooÂ£ to make an inspec- !
tion. The cool: was ratlier frightened, j
not knowing what he niipht rind, tut at j
lensth, after much talking, he was Der- i
euadeJ to go. The crazy man told him
that the Lojd had orderel him to wrap
h.s doming np and put it in the barn
and apply at the hotel for a _sheet or a '
large white tablecloth. The Chinaman
arjrued with t.'ie man and tried to induce
him to put on his garment?, but without |
success, and finally he returned to the '
Jadiei and toid them oi the only terms by
â which they could rid the park of its un- â¢
welcome guest.
A short council of war was held be- ;
tween the ladies and the cook, and it was
liually decided that if the lunatic could be !
bought off with a sheet the sacrifice would
be weli made. The Chinaman was given |
a clean white sheet and sent t6 the shiver
ing madman. The fellow received it,
wound it looÂ«ely over what few garments !
i.c was then wearine, and then walked |
through the main street of the town.
Soon the news spread that he was wild,
and an attempt was made to capture him,
Out be tied up B street and was able to
get away from all his pursuers.
To-day all the young fellows that have
nothing else to do organized themselves j
into little posses and went up in the can- ;
yons in the hope tLat they micht capture
the man robed in a sheet, but when night '
feli they had been unsuccessful. A couple
of deputy con-tables also joined in thÂ«>
chase, ont accomplished no more than the >
other man-hunters.
PREPARING FOR A WAR.
>ynrr Batten ltecflrei Advice* of a
Startling Nature From the
Transvaal.
OAKLAND. Cal., April Henry Bat
ter?, the well-known mining man of the
Transvaal, who now resides in Oakland,
has received dispatches from South Africa
that are ominous. He has large interests
in that part of tiie world, and is kept well
posted on passing events in the Trans
vaal.
"I have received some advices from the
Transvaal," said Mr. Butters to-night,
"that are not at al! indicative of ] eace.
Tne people of Johannesburg are preparing
for an uprising. The Boers are fortifying
the country and are gathering in arms and
ammunition, and several gentlemen are
sending their wives away, realizing that
there is every indication of grave dangsr.
The popular d monstrations with which
Cecil Rhodes has been received do not
surprise those who have lived in South
Africa. He is the head and front of the
Cape Colonies, and his popularity is very
extensive. He is a great oreanizer, and
thoÂ«e who bave already critic. zed the fact
that i.c plecid Schreiner in bis Cabinet
are mistaken, for the move showed his
snrewdness. Schreiner is a representa
tive of the anti-English, anti-progressive,
Hnti-everything element, and Rhodes pnt
him in the Cabinet with the object of win
nin- him and his people over.
. "My advices tell me that the conditions
at Jo. annesburg are far from assuring
just now. There is great depression of
business and bankruptcy stares many of
ihe dealer* in the face. A 1.-rge class of
idle men is in the town and the lack ol |
confidence prevents Industrie" from push- i
ing ahead. The fear of impending war
lias of course much to do with thiÂ«, and
there must also be considered the change
in the plans resulting from this distrust.
For instance, the minine corporations ,
Biade their plans for 1807 on a basis of '
turninp out $500,000 in gold a month, !
â¢tvhereaa, owing io the uncertainty, they
arÂ«> not handling half of that amount.
"1 don't think Kruger is statesman
f-noush to rea.ize the present dangers that
are about him. He lias no advisers either
whose counsel would open his eyes, for he
is surrounded by oi ots who have an in
tense hatred for the Engiigh. His Secre
tary of State is an importation from Hol- .
land B J her ".* s not * progressive man
in his Cabinet.
MRS. CLUNE IS ANXIOUS.
Has Turned Detective and Hints at a
Great Story.
OAKLAND, Cal, Ap.il 27.-Mrs. Clune
is still working to try to discover who is
anxious that she should ba murdered.
Sne has a very complete theory as to tne
plot that underlies the mysteriou-s offer
to the Chinaman of $5000 to take her life.
"I shall do a liMie private detective
work myself," said Mrs. Clune thiÂ» morn
ing, "and 1 do not doubt that I will bring
the proper person to jus'ice. This is no
trifl.ng matter. a:;d I know rnough to con
vince me that I must take good care of
luyself. Tnere .s an interesting story be
hind ull this, but I am not going to tell it
at present."

OAKLAND, Cal., April 27.â Samuel M.
Spackman. who was Injured while at work

that lam still alive. I am a descendant
of the seven tribes of Israel," and some
other Biich remarks. Then he left. To
night he called at The Call office and
maie the same announcement.
He has been wandering ever since the
accident, and often leaves home unknown
to his relatives. He was recently pro
nounced safe to be at laree by the Sanity
Commissioners. His family is said to be

President T. H. Williams of the California
Jockey Club.
JUDGES ARE AT WAR.
Ilrrkele.v Justices' Fees Too Small.
Two Jiidgen Who Do Not Get Knnu h
to Pay Their Monthlj Expenses.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 27.â The war
of the Berkeley Justices os the Peace for
the fees of trials has again broken out.
Each of the Justicosâ C. R. Lord and J.
Gentryâ claims that he does not make
: enough out of trying th^ criminals that
are caught in the university town to sup
port himself, and Judge Lord declares
that Marshal Lloyd is boycotting his
court in favor of that of Judge Gentry.
The latter, however, itates that his entire
monthly income is little more than $20.
Judge Lori has written to the Town
Trustees asking them to appoint him
Justice on salary, to try ail caÂ«es involv
j ing violations of town ordinances. In
this way he hopes to secure enough busi
; ness to pay for the time he gives to the
i business, but Justice Gentry has emphatic
objections to such procedure.
ihe two Berkeley Jast:c?s ara now on
fees. The amount *o' their incomes de
pends upon how many cases Marshal
â  Lloyd takes to their courts, and it is al
leged that the Marshal, who is a Demo
crat, has been taking an unfair proportion
of bis cases to the Democratic Judge
I Gentry.
j Jud^e Lord's proposition that he be put
; on salary has been referred by tne Town
Trustees to the Town Attorney and the
Finance Committee of the board.
i Fire Department.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 27.â Fire Chief
A. L. Olt last night submitted to the
Town Trustees a report recommending
that a fire-alarm system be placed in the
town at once, to consist of at least twenty
boxes, also that two assistant chiefs be
appointed. Tne Chief declared that much
of the damage at recent fires could have
been avoided had proper preparation been
made beforehana.

C!andÂ°stinely.
Uakiown to Her Paren s the BniJe
Is L?d to the Altar in 0. Is
land.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 27.â A pretty
ittle sensation was sprung to-day in the
line of matrimonial ventures. As a result
there is an anxious mother and a deter
mined father in Berkeley to-night. Miss
Emma Earl, who is well known in the
college town, wedded Potter Woods, a
railroad man, in Oakland this afternoon,
and after the ceremony the bride sent
word to her family that she had been mar
ried, and that by thÂ« time the message
reached them the and her "hubby" irouli
be on their way to San Francisco. The
news came as a great shock to the mother,
who had been planning on a delightful
horue-weddine for her daughter. "As it
turned out. Miss Emma was wedded away
from home by i\ stranre minister, witli a
married sister, Mrs. F. W. King, as the
only family representative.
The enga2ement was to have|been pub
licly announced last Sunday morning by
consent of the parents, but the pair
changed their minds and did not give it
out. The bride's mother was much
enevod at the news of her daughter's
strange proceeding and in an interview to
night said that she was wholly at a loss to
know why Emma ran away to marry
Woods. "They have changed their minds
several times," said the mother, "about
their wedding arrangement and I hope
that they ore finally satisfied."

Peaqe once more reigns in the hall
where the Supervisors meet and do busi

no open hostilities, and gradually the
chairs of Mr. Church and Mr. Koeth,
It h Now "Mr." Rceth and "Mr." Church.
which were pushed as far apart as possible
mx weeks ago, arc now coming together.
This morning when the Supervisors en
tere I tbe chamber there was not even a
suggestion of tbe naughty language and
threats used iast month, and tho two com
batants of the board addressed each other
as "Mr."
The veteran of the board, Tom Wells of
Dublin, looked with surprise at the greet
ing of the olj-time enemie?, and County
Clerk Jordan scratched his head with
amazement and would have torn his hair
but for the fact that he has none. â¢
When the Supervisors cot down to busi
ness a series of resolutions was introduced
honoring the memory of ex-Supervisor
Bart Morgan. After being read they were
passed unanimously, and an eneros-ed
copy will be setn to the dead man's
friend?.
A petition was presented by Judge Gib
son asking that a board c* horticultural
commissioners be appointed and that A.
D. Pryal be named on the board. James
P. Taylor, president of tbe Board of Trade,
spoke of the necessity of such a board and
the matter was taken under advisement.
County Auditor Whidden asked the
board to grant him additional clerks, aa
the new county government act places
much extra work on his office with uo
extra compensation. He also stated ho
would like to be given tor his quarters the
lower floor of the annex to tho Hail of
Records. This floor has so far been used
by the Board of Trade for a partial county
exhibit, but the ma.eriai already placed
there is so small that there would be
plenty of room f or both it and tbe Auditor.
The matter of tne county bridge across
the estuary was not taken up, but will be
considered during the week at a special
meeting. There is nothing new in the
proposition, but the time is limited when
work must be undertaken and as tbe rail
road and the Supervisors cannot a?ree on
NOT MUCH FIELD FOR RECRUITING.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 27.â There are two inconsistencies in this city at present which
certainly make it appear that Oakland is not a favorable field for the organization of an
array of unemployed. On the steps at the City Hall 'ieneral Kelly of Industrial army fame
nUhtly proclaims the injustice ex sting which causes men to be out of work when they

For the past three wees* th!a woodyard has been closed bec-auss there were no people offer

PTOMAINE POISONING.
j A r.l'l Meets Itw Death From Using
CoudenÂ«ed Milk Containing
Poisonous Germs.
ALAMEDA, CaI., April 27. âThe death of
the infant child of Mr.and Mrs. Jared Dodge
of 1424 Willow B'reet, in this city, from
the effects of being led condensed milk
containing poisonous germ?, has caused
quite a sensation. It appears that it be
! came necessary to feed the child almost
from its b.rth, and condensed milk was
used. One can was consumed, and then
a second was opened. Soon after the
child was taken violently ill and a doctor
was called, who after muuiry treated the
infant for ptomaine poisoning, but with
out avail, and it died. For some reason
t c matter wai kept very quiet. No death
tiotice was published, the undertaker did
not give out any information, ana it was
by the merest chance that the facts be
came public. The death certificate stated
plainly that death was due to "hemorr
hage enteri'is and acute bemorrhagic
nephritis with shock, all occasioned by
Ptomaine poisoning from change in con
densed milk."
No report was made to the Coroner,
! however, anl that official only learned of
â  the case by the publication. The heaith
j authorities have acted promptly in the
' matter to-day. The can of milk has been
{ obtained and wiJl be analyzed, and in the
â  meantime . n interdict has t,een put on
| ihat brand of the art.cle and its sale will
j not be permitted until the facts are aÂ«cer"
tuined. Samples of the same brand will
be procured from al. the stores dealing
therein, so that no precaution may dÂ« left
unfulfilled.

SAY HE LOOKS
LIKE EDWIN BOOTH
Rev. Dr. Boyer Forced to
Defend Himself From
the Press.
Should N.t Be Held Responsible
for His Un qm Facial
Expressioa.
His Dress Suit Has Not Offenied the
Tastes of the People <f the
Wild West.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,!
908 Broadway, Apnl 27. f
The notoriety given to Rev. Dr. Boyer
of Chicago by the Eastern pros*, whicn her
alded his coming to the coast by pro
claiming him to be the 'Edwin Eootn of
the pulpit,' has caased ihat gentleman
much annoyance. Every newspaper in
the State has bad something to say about
htm, mostly in the line of ridicuie, and a
poet of Fresno named Waterhouse broke
into verse a few days ago, all of which
has been calmly endured by Dr. Boyer
until to-day.
This afternoon he decided that the time
had come to call a halt, and when seen
â¢.:;:- afternoon lie said:
"Because of the unpleasant publicity at
tached to my appearance in this city, I
think lam justified in refuting some un
just insinuations. I am not responsible
lor tbe pseudonyms that the Eastern
press may have appended to ruy name,
nor am I reiponsible for any faciai resem
blance to the illustrious Booth. The an
nouncement that I was to appear with
diamond! is a financial incons;sience,
even were it my bad taste so to appear.
I have worn here a dress suit in
my ministrations, whicu is a common
custom in ihc East, and, to the credit of
the taste of the ueotÂ«le of the West it has
caused no notice. For many years this
has been my manner ol apparel in Dublic
appearances. I regret that the super
ficiality of clothes couid have been pre
sumably my depenuenco on success.
Though a minister for ten years, I have
increasingly depended on the gospel of
Jesus Christ in the salvaiion of m;m, and
am confident that my continuance here
will at least impress my associates with
my absence of arrogance. I have not
been ambitious to be an actor. I have not
been ambitious to surpass tbe humblest
minister. My only ambition has been to
uplift the Christ."
"For many months my congregation
has succeeded without undue publicity, 1 '
said Rev. Edwards Davis, the pastor.
"The glaring announcements of ihe ad
vene 01 Dr. Royer of Chicago mortified
myself, because of a knowledge of the dis
pleasure that they would occasion my
friend. Since his arrival, tbongh there
have been comp.imentary notices of his
ability and worth, I fell confident that
with the constituency already secured
there nÂ«ed be no resort to unusual adver
tisements. His ii'st Sunday nicht service
was attended by at) immense audience.
Throuchout the" week, though less than
â in the Sunday evening, the andiences
represented a cont nual increase, and on
the second Sunday many stood through
out the service. There have nlrrady been
about ten additions to the church, and by
the continuance of the present efficient
ministry of our evangelist I am confident
there will be a great ingathering of souls
for Christ.
"A man, though young as Dr. Boyer is,
who has held remarkable meetings in the
great citie* of our Nation, whose additions
have amounted in ten years to more than
8000 to the church, a man of scholarly elo
quence, with the united support of my
congregation and myself, cannot fail of
remarkable success in our city. As 1
have done h.therto, a;am I gladly ylve
unqualified indorsement and appreciation
of his power in the proclamation of the
gospol of God."
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.
A Question a* to Huw It la AflVcted by
the I a iv Panned l.\ the L.agt
Legislature.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. April 27.â For some
unknown reason and through tome at
present unknown influence the last Legis
lature { asseu an act making the fire de
partments in all cities of ilia fifth class
volunteer organizations. Alameda be
longs to that class, and her Fire Depart
ment, as it has been conducted for many
years, is part volunteer and part paid.
Parties who have been looking the matter
up have been to the city officials and
raised the question whether under tbe law
those charged with dispensing tbe funds
of the city have any authority to ray out
any money to any member of tbe paid
department. They rotnt to the statute,
which is very explicit on the question.
In order to obtain information on the
matter tbe Attorney-General was com
municated with, and he replied that it
was tne business of the District Af.orney
to famish opinions on such questions,
and that if that official desired further in
formation he could apply to the Attornty-
General. No further steps were taken in
ihe premises, but a movement of some
sort is looked for.
If the law shall be upheld and tbe
authorities be forbidden from paying the
expenses of the paid department the city
wiil save about f 15,000 a year which It is
now paying out. The maintenance of the
department would tail upon the insurance
companies, so it is claimed, until such
time as the law cau be repealed or
amended.
So far nothing has been done beyond
discussing the probable scope of the law,
though some decided move is looked for
ere long.
FAVORING EOME TALENT.
Alameda Girls to Have Preference As
City School Teachers
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 27. âThere is a
rule in the echoo; department of this city
not to employ any one as a teacher who
has not had at least two year? of practical
experience as a teacher. Director Brown
at the meeting of tiie Board of Education
this evening suggested doing away with
this rule so as to give the preference,
whenever a vacancy may occur, to Aa
tneda giris, graduates ol the Normal
School, even though they may not hare
had the practical experience as substitute
teachers. His idea was to uive theai posi
tions at $40 a month and take tnem on
trial for a year, as it were, such experi
ment to be essayed in primary rÂ« well as
grammar grades The matter was referred
to the Committee on Rules for considera
tion, and no doubt will be favorably acted
upon by it.
To Exemplify a Sy tern
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 27â Miss Stone,
the teacher ot music in the scnools of this

department of AlameJa city.

SUPERVISORS WILL
TRAMP THE ROOFS
Metal- Workers Ask for
Changes in the Present
Specifications.
Claim Tbat the Fire- Proofing
Ordinances Are O.ten
Vioiated.
A Lively Meeting of the Fire Com
mittee Results in an In
vestigation-
Within a few days the strange fight of
a committee of the Board of Supervisors
trooping over the roofs of the business
portion of the City looking for defective
roofs and studying up specifications for
fireproof asphalt work may be seen.
The representatives of various com
panies that manufacture aspbaltnm roofs,
a number of metal-roofers ana the com
mittee held a protracted conference yester
day discussing the ordinance regarding
fireproof roofs with a view of amending
and improving it so as to be satisfactory
to all parties.
The metal-roofers claimed that the
aaphaltnm roofs permitted by the pr tsent
i ordinance are not fireproof and are so
tiimaily constructed as to be dangfcrous.
They said that in order to make roofs of
j that character thoroughly fin-proof :hey
I should be laid on a foundation uf til*, and
â  that a regulation to that effect should be
: added to the present specifications. One
I representative declared that Eastern com
panies were taking contracts for roofs at
! so low a figure that they could not live up
' to the specifications without losing money,
and that they haa cut wages to such an
, extent in their competition that metal
roofers could r.ot compete with them.
The speaker declared that several sam
j pies of asphalt work presented by the as
i phalt-workers had been specially prepared
j for the occasion, and that they were not
fair samples of the work done.
They produced several samples cut from
! the roofs of buildings, that they claimed
; were not goodâ up to specifications. One
j speaker claimed that tin roots were far
better and more durable than asphalt
1 roofs and that they would withstand heat
that would melt or entirely consume an
asphalt roof.
The asphalt roofers, on the other hand,
j claimed that their roofs were constructed
i according to specifications and when
! so laid were entirely firepro -f and that
j the proposed changes in the specifications
' would work a hardship on them.
Contradictions ana controversies be
tween the opposing partie* grew so warm
, that Chairman Britt of the committee hsd
j to use h'.s gavel frequently to preservo
j order.
Supervisor Devany finally moved that
the matter be laid over for two weeks to
give the committee an opportunity of
making a pe:sonal inspection of various
mo.s that had been cited as defective, and
this course was decided on.
Delegations from both the metal and as
phalt roofers will accompany the commit
tee when it makes its rounds.
MORGAN HAS A SCHEME.
He Will Op?n Kindergartens
for Religious Teach
ing.
Judga Talcott Says a Lawyer's Duty
Is to Prevent Litiga
tion.
Rev. Henry Victor Moraan has a plan
for evaneelizing this City by means of
Christian kindergartens. Mr. Morgan is
the pastor of the C'hr.stian Church of Ala
rue-ia, and Monday he laid hia kinder
garten scheme before the Christian Minis
ters' meeting, and a motion of indorse
ment was passed.
"My idea," said the Alameda pastor,
"is to open free kindergartens in various
pnrts of this City, where the children shail
receive religious a* well as secular instruc
tion. All the teachers will be certificated
kindergarteners, but they will he profess
ing Christians as well. In connection
with this a headquarters will be opened,
where working women can leave their
children during the day, and where chil
dren and adul:s can have access to a li
brary of religious iiterature."
Mr. Morgan is raising the money for his
scheme by monthly subscriptions, varying
from 25 cents to $150. He will open the
nrat kindergarten when the subscribers
number 1000, and he stated yesterday that
lie expected soon to reach the required
number. Rev. Edward T. Nesbet, for
merly pastorof the First Christian Church
of Oakland, is Mr. Morgan's organizer j
and assistant In the kindergarten scheme.
They will open an office in this City in n
few days, but its location is not yet deft*
nitely settled.

SUICIDE IN THE BRUSH.
Bcdy of an Unknown German
Anarchist Found in thÂ°
Sand.
Left a Letter Glorying in the Red
Flag-He Was a Man of Some
Education.
John Sullivan of 228 Day street and
William Graham o! 419 Twenty-ninth
street while waiting yesterday among the
sand-dunes back of the Affiliated Col
leges found the badiy decomposed re
mains of a man lying in the bruÃh.
Close to the right hand of the coipse lay a
nickel-plated revolver that told a story of
suicide.
The features of the dead were unrecog
nizub'p, the unfortunate man having tak
en his life about two months before. The
body was taken to the Morgue and the
clothing searched. Three tickets of admis
sion to the World's Columbian Exposition
at Chicago, bearing different dates in the
month of October, 1893, werelound. Also
a letter wrkten in German evidently by
she deceaÂ»ed an i dated San Francisco,
February 10, 1897. not addressed to any
one and anarchistic and incoherent in
tone. Ii is signed "P. B."or "R, B." or
"U. B."
The handwriting is evidently that of an
educated man and one used to handling a
pen, the German characters being very
neatly formed and fluently written. The
letter speaks of the glory of the scarlet flag
of anarchism, and here and there are sen
tences in English reading as follows and
dovetailed into the German:
Inquiry Into the proper mode of rendering
the word of God In translating the sacred
scriptures into the Chinese language.
Also the following:
Francis Buchanan on the religion of the
Bramas in the Asiatic researches.
A Yn'.e key and a dark tortoise-shell
penknife were aiso found upon the body.
The clothing was of dark diagonal goods,
gaiter shoes and while shirt. The hair of
the deceased wa3 dark brown and curly.

BONDS OF THE WICKED.
The Grand Jury Begins a Vigor
ous N sing Into Pol.cc
Court Affairs.
Cierk Foley's Chinese Bonds and the
Who c F. miliar M^ss Is Being
Gone; Into.
Tue Grand Jury yesterday began an in
vestigation of the giving and receiving
of bomis which have to do with the liber
ties of the multitude of the wicked who
have business with policemen and the
police courts.
Police Court bonds are always a mesa of
law. politics and pulls to which mystery
clings and which are good for an "investi
gation" any day. Out of the rights and
rivalries of Police Court attorneys has
come i he nerve force which has catib6cl
tbÂ«- Grand Jury to strike as it has done.
There lias been bruitod about a story
that James Foley, a clerk in J udue Con
lan's Police Court, has been accepting
good-for-nothing bonds in ca-es of Chi
nese arres-ted by the police during raids
on gambling aena and so on. In all of
these cases the defendants have secured
dismissals or paid $3 fines, and there is no
charge or evidence that the City bus lost
any good money because oi the alieged
irregularities. However, the Grand Jury
i* goins; into a rigid investigation of Mr.
Foley's bonds and also into a more or les*
thorough investigation of the whole Police
Court bond business. ThiÂ« will p obably
take up a good deal of the Grand Jury's
attention for a lew weeks.
The Grand Jury at its session yester
day took the new matter up by unani
mous consent. Clerk Foley responded to a
summons with all the bonds tie has issued
during March and April. But six of these
were gone 'horoueh.y into at the session.
Foley testified that in ai! aes he was
duly satisfied of the suffic encj of the
security. Pong Ding, the offic al investi
gator of Cliinese bonds, was examined for i
a IsW minutes.
It :s said that the bonds issued by Foley
will show technical irregularities, due to
carelessness and so on, which would in
validate some of them if an action for re
covery were brought, but that iie and
his bonds are no better or worse th:in the
rest of the Police Court bond mess, which
generally deserve a shaking up and a

SHE WILL
FOLLOW
BALDWIN
Emma Ashley Says She
Is Ready to Go
East.
LUCKY CANNOT LOSE HER
THAT WAY.
She Has a Friend Who V, i .
Telegraph Her All the Money
Necessary.
WANTS TO MEET HIM FACE TO
PACE.
If Ha Will Only Prov.d? for the Cbiid
the Sisters Say They Will
Let H m Alone.
Even should "Lucky" Baldwin take
himself to the East he will not be rid of
his Nemesis in the person of Emma Ash
ipy, the sister of Lillian, who has seem
ingly devoted her life ar:d energies to
securing wiiat she claims to be justice,
not so much for her sisier as for Beatrice
Anita, her sister's child.
Emma and Baby Beutrice are still at
tne home of Mis. H. G. Woodman, 216' i
Porland street, where they found a refuge
Sunday night after leaving the Baldwin
Hotel. Mrs. Woodmau is a well-known
temperance and prison wcrker. and made
the acquaintance of the Ashley sisters at
the City Prison after Emma's attempt to
shoot Baldwin in court.
Commenting on there-port that Baldwin
was preparing to sro East to avoid any
further annoyance from the Ashleys,
Emma remarked :
"He can't escape me by going East. He
won't be there iong before I toliow. 1
have no money, but 1 still have a few
friends left, and one of them In ihe East
has Wiitten to me that whenever I wi.beii
to go East she would telegraph me the
money necessary to pay mv expenses. I
know sll the haunt 3 of 'Lucky' Baldwin
in the East. He generally goes 10 St.
.Louis, Saratoga and the places where
racing is going on. He shan't evade me.
Ho need not think he can escape me.
"I want to find him and make him face
me. 1 want to have a talk with him and
see if 1 can't make him do something for
the child and aci like a man. I only want
to have an interview with him. I think
he â will listen to me if 1 can only meet
him face to face.
"Jusl imagine the situation. Here is
the child of a millionaire, whose mother is
too sick to earn her living, let alone doing
anything for her child, who is dependent
on charity for its maintenance. Can you
expect a woman to rest quiet under such
cruel wrongs?
"He is so contemptibly mean that I
suppose he would spend millions on law
yers rather than give anything to support
his child. Neither mv sister nor myself
want any of his money. We only want
him to provide for the b.iuv. A child is a
great deal of care. She is always needing
something. She must be educated, sne
must be clothed and fed and housed and
must have some one to take charge of her.
"I tried to have the child placed in the
Orphaus' Home- on Haight street, but
they told me they could not take her in,
as their rales permitted the admission ol
orphans and liali-orphans only. They
said it was a great shame that there was
no law ir. this State which compelled the
father of an illegitimate child to provide
for it. They promised to place the mat
ter before the Doaid of directors, which
will meet a week from Friday.
"I hardly know what I shall do. All
winter I worked and supported us all; but
now my sister is sick and I must take care
of the oaby, so there is no one to earn a
dollar for us.
"But Mr. Baldwin need not think we
are through with him yet, for we are not
by any means. We will bound him until
he decides to be a man. If he don't do
something he won't iive in peace.
"I see that Reuben Lloyi, one of his at
torneys, says we are blackmailers. I can
only repeat that we don't want a penny of
his money for ourselves, but simply for
his child. To think of a millionaire's
child being thrown upon charity ! It is
more than any one with any grain ol
feeling can bear. It is certainly more
than lean bear. If he had only a. little
courage he would face the situation like a
man.
"I hardly know which way to turn.
To-morrow I shall again see what I can
do lor the child and shall incidentally
continue to find Mr. Baldwin and have a
talk with him."
When Miss Ashlev paused Mrs. Wood
man, who is a iady 70 years of age, re
marked in a supcestive, questioning,
sympathetic w:iy: "J wonder if he could
not be induced to pay $"> a month for the
child's care at the Boys' and Girls' Aid
Society. Don't you think he would?"
Before any repiv could be made by the
reporter Miss Ashley remarxed in nope
less, weary tones:
"Hardly; I think he is too mean to do
anything unless he is compelled to. Even
if he were disposed to aid the child, his
lawyers would advise him against it."
FRESH WATER FISHES.
Professor Gibsrt of Stanford
Lectured Before the Fly-
Casting Club.
The Ichthyologist Said That the Trout
of the Coast Streams Were the
Biggest Puzzi- of AH.
Prosessor Gilbert, the ichthyologist of
Stanford University, lectured last evening
in the room of tho Fish Commissioners,
Flood building, t-eiore a large and en
thusiastic gathering ol sportsmen.
His subject was the "Fresh-water
Fishes of the Pacific Coast," but the
speaker gave the better part of the even
ing to discussing ihe peculiarities of the
salmon and trout families.
He said that there were live varieties of
the salmon, namely: The king, blueback,
silver, don and humpback, uiict that the
blueback salmon, which are very plenti
ful in Alaska, do not spawn la the streams,
but work their passage through the rivers
and tributaries until they reach the lakes,
where thfy reproduce their species.
â¢He continud: "Xliere ia a lake named
Allowa in Northern California where the
bluebacUs are very plentiful during certain
months of trie ysar. The Sacramento
salmon, which is known as the qninnat,
is a very common lish and can be found
in riiv of the large rivers north of this
place, "but the bluebaces do not get down
as far as our waters.
"In Idaho there is a variety of the
salmon family known fls the K-dti-h,
which affords "irraiut sport to anelers. It
has a companion which is n -mall nsh
that re-em it in almost every par
tienhtr and is known to Idahnans as the
Yank. Tho 'Yanks' spawn and live all
the year round in tJie lake, and 1 presume
that ihe reason why they UO not grow
to a large size.
"I think that the Fish Commissioners
of this State struck the righ; idea when
thÂ»y decided to plant the young of the
salmon in the Bireantft contiguous to the
ocean. I'he recent planting of s-veral
thuusand salmon try in the Olema and
Paper-mill creeks and \l\e Russian River
has already shown si^ns of vast improve
ment over the old style of planting^ wnich
was in the headwaters of rivers distant
hundreds of miles from the ocean.''
A bottle containing two salmon iry was
exhibiten. One of the liÂ«heÂ«, which was
only a lew days ago taken from tho
Olema. hatchery, measured about one
inch in length; the other, taken in the
tidewater of Paper-mill Creek, measured
three inches in lengin and was singularly
<leep ,n i oj>ortion toitsmze. Two months
ai o i lie young quinnat salmon were liber
ated irom the Olema hatchery, and if all
or a good p'srt of the ones that were given a
chance to reach their native element, have
done at< well as the fry which was caught
a few days a>so in the brackish waters of
the stream, i. is safe to say that the Fish
Commissioners have experimented with
remarkably good success.
Tne professor said that four varieties of
silmon are founil in the Sacramento River.
The dog salmon â worthless li-<h â enters
the river in S ptember and spawns in
October and November. In fact, he re
ceived some fry of the dog salmon which
were taken from Scott Creek, a small
stream in Santa Cruz County.
"YeÂ«, we can segregate the salmon fam
ijy and distinguish the varieties easily,"
said the professor, "but I cannot say the
same for the trout of the coastwise
streams.
"Professor Jordan and myself have
time and time again discussed this trout
question, but candidly speaking we are no
nearer to an opinion than we were w;.en
we commenced.
"Possibly tne steelhead and the so-called
rainbow are one ar.d the same kind, but I
cannot say positively ;that this is a tact.
People Who Were Prominent at Yesterday's Session of the Fair
Trial.
The fish you call a rainbow an<l which is
generally known now throughout the land
as such is not a rainbow at all.
"It is a steelheao. and the fishes in the
Truckee and other inland rivers would
immediately depart lor the ocean if they
had an opportuniiy to reach salt water.
"I can give you no authentic informa
tion on this coast-trout .subject, as it has
been a puzzle to me since I commenced
the study ot it, but possibly the informa
tion you desire is locked up in the vault
of the Fish Commission."
The shot sent Commissioners Babcock
and Vogelsang from their respective
chairs, but they came aro'ind all rigtit i n
the course of time.

Does Not Deny That Fair

A Fe ling Rife That the Defense Is
Preparing to Explcde a
Bombshell.
The whereabout! of the late Senator
Fair on the L'4th of September, 1594, was
the flitting shadow airain pursued yester
day by the attorneys engaged in the Fair
caÂ«=e.
That was the eventful day on which Mrs.
Nettie Craven asserts that the millionaire
miner made out two wiils in her house in
this City and also gave her the two valua
ble deeds, the genuineness of which con
stitutes the basis of the preent litigation.
Counsel for the Fair estate are essaying
to prove that Senator Fair suent ti.at day
in San Rafael and therefore could not
have been over on this >ide of the bay, too.
D. M. Delmas' cross-examination of the
witnesses who have so far testified to hav
ing seen the Senator in San Rnfael has
not as yet allowed to slip an inkling as to
just what method is to be em ployed to off
set this evidence. It is more than mani
ie*t, however, that the defense has "some
thing up its sleeve" in this regard. The
countenances of the attorneys for Mrs.
Craven plainly indicate this, and it is
causing the other side no small amount of
worry.
The frequent exchange of significant lit
tle smiles and winks up and down the
line seems to have a harrowing effect upon
them. And something more happened
that rather deepened the mystery. This
was an announcement made by Mr. Del
mas at a time when Lawyer McKnerney
was putting in his strongest, efforts to
show the jury, by means of his witnesses,
that Senator Fair arrived at San Rafael
on the 19th of September and, took rooms
at the Parisian Hotel. Mr. Delmas smil
ingly said that there was no necessity for
all the ostentation that was being dis
played in adducing this evidence, for the
reason that the defense had not disputed
that the Senator went across the bay on
that date, and, furthermore, was not go
ing to dispute it.
This deprived the other side of much of
its thunder. What is coming next is what
everyhodv is guessing about.
W. J. McMullen, assistant general pas
senger and freight agent of the San Fran
cisco and North Pacific Railroad, was the
first witness called when court was called
to order yesierday morning. All he was
askea by the plaintiffs' counsel was in ref
erence to the lime schedule of the road
he represents during September, 1894.
J. A. Schneider, a barber and tobacconist
of San Rafael, was then called. Schneider's
son testified Monday that he saw Senator
Fair in San Rafael on September 124, and
now the father was summoned to add
corroboratiou. He had a book which he
said had entries that assisted him in re
membering .li.it he, too, saw the Senator
on that day, but Judge Slack would not
permit the use of this book in court.
Schneider resorted to his memory then,
and said the Senator bought some cigars
from him on the 24th.
Mr. Del mas proceeded on cross-ex? ru
ination to test ihe witness 1 ability to re
member events other than Fair's alleged
visit to San Rataelâ to test him in the
same manner that caused the witnesses
of Monday's session so much discom
fiture. Schneider had only vat;ue recol
lections as to the dates on wjich ho was
served with aubpenas, when he talkea
with Detective Seymour, what the latter
had to say, and various other matters ol
that sort. But as regards the L'4tu of Sep
tember, 1894, he said his mind -was as
clear as a bell, even though the events of
that day were not of a character calcu
lated to make much of an impression
on anybody, so ordinary were they.
Mr. Del mas wrung irom Schneider an
admission that as soon as he found him
self on this side of the bay yesterday
iuorning he went directiy to the oflice of
the Chief of Police, and there he met De
tective Seymour. First he said he wa<
told to report there, and then when he
found that this statement caused the at
torneys for vie plaintifts to scow! he
equivocated. Now he was sure that he
lukJ only wandered into the Chief's ollice
accidentally during his search through
the City Hall for Judge Slack's court
room.
James W. Harris, superintendent of the
Calif ornia-s'reet cable road, was called to
testify simply as to tho time consumed by
one ot bis cars to travel from t lit* ferry
terminus to Uuchanan street. Fourteen
minutes, he said, was the average run.
Henry Cassou, now a lr.undryman in
this City, but formerly proprietor of the
Parisian Hotel in San Rafael, was then
called to the stand, and t here he stayed
all day lor the reason doubti -ss that he
is the plaintifts' most important witness
in connection with the San Rafael story.
He testified (bat Senator Fair came to his
house on the l!)th of September, 1894, and
remained there six days. Before he went
any further the court Indulged in the
u-tial noon recess.
Tbe examination of Cassou waÂ» re
sumed when court reconvened for the
afternoon session.
'â¢How do you remember that Senator
Fair went to your hotel on the 19th of
September, 1894?" was Mr. McEnerney's
question.
"Well, I had a btr: party coming to the
house at ;hat time," replied Cassou. "I
wai taking care of the Masons, who were
having a time there. I was arranging a
banquet for them. I was very busy at the
time, and remember very well that I
conld not give Senator Fair the rooms he
wanted."
"How do you know that he left the
house on the lisih of September?"
"Oh, it's down on the book â I remem
ber it very well."
Here Mr. Delmas arose and asked Cas
sou if he was swearing that the alleged
fact that Senator Fair left on that date
appeared on his book.
"No, it's not on the book," said Cassou,
contradicting himself. "But I remember
so very well."
The hotel register was ben produced
and Mr. McEnerney marie an effort to have
it introduced in evidence. He met with
an objection, however, from the defense,
the ground taken being that, while the
lact that Senator Fair registered there
was not disputed, the allegation that he
did so on the linh of Sev>teniber, 1894, did
not appear in the book. Mr. Delmas, who
presented the objection, called attention
to the fact that a marginal menioratidum,
written long after Fair registered, was all
there was In the booK to show that he did
so on the date in auestion. This
memorandum was acknowledged not to
bo in the handwriting of Fair.
"Nobody lias denied that Senator Fair
was in Rafael on the 10th of Septem
ber," said Mr. Deimas. 'This will not be
disputed, either, so why all this parade?"
Quite a little talk followed, in which
the court and Messrs. Delroas.and McEner
ney participated, and it was all about the
admissibility of the register. Judge Slack
finally decided that he would allow me
book in, but said he would reserve the
right to cunnge his ruling and strike out
the evidence if he should discover later
on that he waa in error.
Mr. McEnerney then read off the names
appearing on the'pace where that of James
G.Fairand his valet appeared. The page also
showed that Judce J. V. Coffey and "Mere"
Coffey were cavorting over in San Rafael
about that time, and must have been hav
ing sport with the native*, judging from
the manner in which they registered.
1 ne distinguished jurist who presides over
the destinies of ttie Probate Court first
gave bis residence on the book as the
"southeast corner of McAllister and Lar
kin streets," which woulJ be the City
Hall, and Jere's was given as Siicramento.
Their names appeared airoin on the same
page, lower down, but this time as hailing
from Silver City, Idaho.
Mr. McEnerney now essayed to hand the
book over to the iury, but Mr. Del mas op
posed this course because, he said, he be
lieved the plaintiffs were not sincere in
their statement us to what, was intended
to be proved by the i-ignatures 1 .
"I am not quite so blind as the gentle
men on the oi her side evidently think,"
he said. "They are not ollering this book
in evidence for the purpose of showing
that Senator Fair was at the Parisian
Hotel on Septemb?r 19, for if they were
they would not be so persistent in present
ing it after we have admitted that he was
there on that date. What they are trying
â¦o do is to show that Judge Coffev was
there."
"As I understand it," said Judge Slack,
"it is being offered to prove ttiat Senator
Fair was tbere."
"Very well tben, if that will hold Rood
we will offer no further objection to the
register," said Mr. Delmas. "All we
wanted to know was just what the other
aide was endeavoring to do."
The register was passed over to the jury
for inspection and tben the examination
of (Jassou was resumed. In answer to
further inquiries be said ne nad a distinct
recollection of the 25th ol September â his
memory b*ing br;;siied up Dy a reference
to his cashbook â because Jon that day be
ran ont of 'olack ink and made all of his
entres In red ink. He pioduced the cash
book and showed these entries. There
was also an entry there dated September
19 and written in black ink, meant to show
thai Senator Fair was given two rooms on
that date, and opposite this in red ink
'"?<j," the amount Cassou claims he was
paid by the Saaator on the 25th for his six
days' lodgings at the hoiel. This book
was also suown to the jury, the uefense
offering no objection.
Cassou seemed to be productive of all
sorts of reminders of the '_'4th oi Septem
ber and the days immediately pr ceding
and succeeding it as long ns he remained
in tbe hands dt Mr. McEnerney. After the
cashbook and us vari-colored entries he
produced a document showing that he
registered as a qualified voter in San Ra
ise! on the 24ui of September, and this
also went into evidence without encoun
tering any objection, Mr. Delmas re
marking that, as it could liave no bearing
upon Mrs. Craven's deeds, its introduction
co-ild certainly do no harm.
Mr. Delmas "now took hold of tho hotel
man, and learned from him that it was
not the custom of all persons stopping
at the Parisian Hotel to put their signa
tures on the register. Tne witness said
they could register if they wanted to or
leave the book alone, as he was not par
ticular.
Counsel then went after the witness re
garding his memory. Cassou sintered
like other witnesses in this respect. While
he could remeniDer vividly nearly every
thing that transpireit during those six
linya that Senator Fair was ;it the hotei,
even to the details of n conversation he
hau had with Judge Coffey, still he could
not guess within two weeks when the
Judge next visited San Rafael, and could
recollect absolutely nothing of subsequent
conversations tie had with him.
The register was again leferred to, and
Mr. Delmas warned to know something
about the signatures of W. P. Lawlor and
n San Rafael lawyer, which appeared just
beneath the signature of Senator Fair.
Ca^sou said these names were written
there some time after the death of the
millionaire. They said they represented
the executors of the Fair estate. Alter
their visit the witness wrote- the marginal
entry opposite Senator F.iir's signature.
This late entry comprised the disputed
date "September 24, 1591," and was vrrit
ten. as near as Cassou coul i remember, on
the Ist of June, 1865.
â¢'Was Senator Fair a well man when he
was at your house that time?" asked Mr.
Delmas.
"No, be was sick sometimes," was the
reply.
"Wliat was the nature of his sickness?"
'He had the asthma â he couid not
brenthe. One night he wr.s pretty bad."
''Was there anything else the matter
with him that you* know of?"
"I knew of nothing."
Cassou was still on the stand when court
adjourned, so he will probably be asked a
few more questions to-day.
SANG THE "MESSIAH."
First Concert of the California
Music Festival Asso
ciation.
Handel's Oratorio G v n With a G cd
Chorusâ To-Night' s Can
cert.
It was a very small audience that Mme.
Gonevra Johnstone-lJishop captured at
Metropolitan Temple last nig. it, but such
as it was the Chicugo singer may be said
to have owned it from the time she sang
her tirst solo in Handel'a good old "Mes
siah."
Mme. Bishop is the star attraction of the
California Musical Festival Association,
but so modestly has that organization
hidden its light under a bushel that the
general public was scarcely aware that a
musical festival was to be given at all.
Even amateurs of oratorio had scarcely
realized that Mme. Bishop had already
arrived. The quiet way in which the asso
ciation has tone about its work was no
doubt lesponsible for the homeopathic
quantity of audience present last night.
Tiio^e who did attend can congratulate
themselves upon having heard a rarely
accomplished j'inger.
Last night's concert consisted of the
"Messiah," with a chorus augmented by
contingents ot vocali ts from San Jose,
Sacramento, Alan.eda and Oakland.
James Hamilton Howe, who conducted,
had drilled and arranged the chorus,
which was unusually well balanced for
an organization consisting chiefly of ama
teurs. All four parts did good work, the
trebles never being too much in evidence,
and the teuors and altos bearing their
lull share of the work.
Tmc chorus that went with the best pre
cision, spirit and attack was. "All We
Like Sheej> Have Gone Astray, 1 ' but all
the choruses reflected credit on the singers
and on the conductor.
In addition to the full chorus, there was
a senn-cborus, consisting of twenty-four
voices.
Mme. Genevra Johnstone-Btshop, who
made her first San Francisco appearance
last nigh i, is a soprano of whom very flat
tering accountH have been heard, and >he
soon proved that nothing too much had
been said in her favor. Her Voice is full
and sv.eet. with n wide compass, and both
in cantabile and in florid pasÂ«aÂ£res she
uses it excellently. In the florid embroi
deries of 'liejoce Greatly" she was as
much at home as in the more feeling
"Come Unto Him." Every note was
rounded and sweet, and the execution was
brilliantly clear cut.
In addition to her natural and technical
endowments, Mine. Bishop bus the true
oratorio breadth and dignity of style. It
was a matter of regret that she omitted
"How Beauti'ul Are the Feet," for al
though the "Messiah" is almost invari
ably given with cuts, that gem is seldom
omitted.
Mmo. Moeller, the contralto, has a syrc
patnetic voice of true contralto quality,
and she sang well, but her voice was
scarcely powerful enough for the build
in c.
Thf bass role presents vocal difficulties
with which Homer Heniey was not able
to compete successfully. He sang '"The
People That Walked in Darkness" well,
but the more florid roles were rendered in
a slovenly manner.
Frank Coffin, the tenor, sang with ex
pression nnd good intentions, but liis
vibrato unfits his voice for oratorio.
Tnere will be concerts both thii after
noon and evening at Metropolitan Temple,
when Mme. Bishop will be tho cine:
attraction.
A NEW CATHOLIC CHURCH.
The People of St. Charles Parish Will
Build n Fine Kdiflce.
Rev. P. J. Cummins of St. Charles
Church is very hopeful that money will be
forthcoming before long with which to be
gin the new church on tho lot 140x245 feet
at Seventeenth and Shotwell streets.
"Wo intend to make a school of the old
church," ?awl he last night, "and the new
church, though the funds are not yet in
sight, will be a superb structure.''
As tho parish is bounded by Mission,
Thirteenth and Twenty-first streets, the
territory is surh'cient to warrant the build
ing of a fine structure. The population in
that vicinity is increasing raDiilly, and
there will be need for a ;arÂ«e church.
Mullen's HnspitHl Scheme.
C. A. Mullen, the privnte detective, and his
wile cailed upon Captain Bohen last night and
declared that their scheme to procure funds
by nu'Hiis of gluss receptacles placed in sa
loons lor the benefit of "associated hospitals"
was periectly legitimate. They further stated
that they had consulted with the different
hospital authorities as to the scheme and had
secured their approval. Detective Wren will
call upon the hospital authorities to-day to
ascertain what tbey have to say on the snb
ject.

WILD ANIMALS TO
ROAM AT WILL
Latest Plans of the Pro
moters of the New
Mission Park.
They Want Acres of Land Along
the Hillsides of the
"Warm Belt."
Permanent Organization of Tbose
Interested n the Plan Has
B-en Effect d.
There was a meeting yfsterday of those |
most interested in the Mission Park j
project, and as a result permanent ortjani- j
zation was effected. There was ulso a j
discussion of the kind of park to be pro
vided, should the present movement
prove successful, und gradually the idea ]
of a zoological garden is shaping itself, j ,
and before the promoters are ihrouph the i
Mission may have its park peopled with I
specimens of wild animals from all over '
the world. j ,
The idea is to have a place of about 500 i
acres inclosed within a stout iron railing '
and to allow the animals to roam at large, ]
almost as in their native state.
A. B. Maguire objected at first to the
proposition of permanent organization, as j
he said it wai better to fo organize at a !
masa-meeting instead of a small meeting!
of the promoters. It was decided to go |
ahead, however, and so the following per- j
manent officers were elected:
President. Genr e D. Shadburne; first |
vice-president, W. M. Bunker; second i
vice-president, George Center; secretary, I
J. J. McEwen; recording secretary, J. H. i
Grady; honorary vic-presidents â Mayor:
I. D. Phelan, C. 0. Bemis, Colonel John
O'liyrne, A. B. Maguire, Major B. Me- I
Kinne, W. EL Crim, William Metzner, [
| Professor A. P. Tornilli, John A. Buck' I
George R. Fietrher anrt P. W. Donrmann.' '
The treasurer will te ciecieu at, ihe n ext
meeting.
The president appointed J. J. McEwen '
Colonel John O'Bvrne, W. M. Bunker T*. ;
V. O'Brien and William Metzner a com- â 
lniuee on constitution and declaration of i
principles.
W. L. Williamson, Major McKinne an 1 j
John H. Grady were appoited a committee
to secure the co-oi>er:ition of tne associ
ated cuibs at the next meeting.
It is intended to make i her ark a people's j
pleasure-ground in every sense of the !
word, not merely a square among a lot of i
houses. It will occupy acre? or land along
the hillsides and will be mado a credit to ;
the Mission.
BASS FOR SAN JOAQUIN.
The Maters of tlie Valley to Be
Well Stocked With
Fish.
The State Board of Fish and Game Com
missioners are making extensive prepara
tions to stock tlie waters of the ban Joa
quin Valley witn large and small mouth
black basts. That section isconsiderd the
besl in lue State, as In waters are spe
cially adapted to this kind of fish. Be
sides there are no very good food or game
tiÂ«h in the main watersol the valley.
The wonderful propagating qualities of
ihese fiUfa may be illustrated by one of the
official report". Several years ago the
United States Fish Commissioners placed
thirty mature bass in a large pond near
Washington, D. C, and late in the fall the
old ones were seined out. The little ones
were then taken out and found to number
37,300. In their natural state the old fish
pio-ect their young until they are able
to care for themselves.
It is the wish of the California commis
sioners to stock the streams of the valley
with not only a game fish, but a food fish,
that will be a feature in the i"cal and in
terior markets within a few years.
The first move in this direction was
made by the commissioners leasing
Colonel George Sperry's large lake at
Alta, known as Aha Lake, in Placer
County. This body of water covers
twenty-seven acres. In thia will be placed
seventy-five full-grown bass, and it is ex
pected that by the time the lease expires
in tnree years, thousands of fish c*n be
taken from the lake.
The. commissioners have also rented an
artificial body of water one and a half
miles from Niles. This is known as Clear
Lake and it is live ac:es in rise, Into this
will be put 105 black hass. These two
lakes will be distributing or shipping
points. The baÂ«s to be placed therein will
be taken from the retaining pond at the
Sisson hatchery. There the waters are
too cold for propagating purposes for the
bass.
A large number of small mouth black
bass will be placed in the watÂ«rs of the
San Joaquin Valley at once. Tiiene will
be gathered by Deputies Wiison and Cross
in the sink-holes or pools of the Russian
River and distributed at once.
Russia's penal statistics show that in
the dominion of the Czar the women
criminals outnumber the men by nearly
50 per cent, just the contrary being the
case in other countries. Most of the
women criminals are unmarried, and tlie
majority come from the laboring classes
in me citios.
