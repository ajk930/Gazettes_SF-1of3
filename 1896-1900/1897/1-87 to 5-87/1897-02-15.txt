BRITISH COMMANDER ENTERS
A PROTEST.
It Is Said That the Opposition to the
Greek National Sentiment Will
Endanger the Throne.
â¢ ATHENS, Gbebce, Feb. 14. â Advices
have been received giving details of the
detention at Candia of Turkish vessels by
a Greek warship. The vessel which was
stopped and compelled to return to her
anchorage was the Turkish ' transport
Fuad, bound for Canea with munitions
for the besieged garri-on at that place.
As the Fuad moved from her anchorage
and started to leave the harbor the Greek
â¢warship headed in Â«uch a direction as to
intercept her and ordered her to stop.
No attention being paid to this order the
(ireek vessel fired two shots across the
Fuad's bow and the transport, being un
armed, put about and returned to her
moorings. It is reported that the com
mander of the British fleet protested
against the action of the Greeks and
ordered the vessels of that nation to
make no further attacks upon the Turks.
The army reserves of 1*!Â»3 and 1894 have
been called out and ordered to hold them
selves in readiness to join their colors at
forty-eight hours' notice. A number of
detachments of infantry, artillery and
engineers have embarked at the Pirseus for
Crete. Their departure was attended with
great enthusiasm.
It is understood that the orders of the
troops are to protect the Christian fami
lies in Crete and to restore order. This is
looked upon as tantamount to the occu
pation of the island, Greece has notified
the powers that she will willingly hold
herself answerable for the steps she has
tafcen.
Colonel Vassos, chief aid-de-camp to
King George, commanded the troops,
which numbered 1500. As the men
man- .ed aboard the vessel which was to
convey them to Crete large crowds of peo
ple who had gathered to witness their de
parture cheered them a;ain and again.
â¢ CANEA, Cbete Feb. 14. â Prince George
of Greece, who arrived here on February
12 in command of the Greek flotilla, after
receiving visits from the commanders of
the foreign warships returned to MiJo.
It is reported that the Beys of Canea
have requested the commanders of the
foreign warships here to land men from
their vessels to occupy the city. Tne in
tense excitement v, hich has prevailed here '
recently has not at all abated.
Georte Bs rovitch Pasha, the Christian
Governor of Crete, who having been men
aced by the Moslems, recently took refuge
at the Greek Consulate, and the Greek
Consul embarked this evening on differ
ent warships. They were accompanied
by their families. The Consuls and com
mander of the Turkish forces have re
moved to the military post. The insur
gents continue their bombardment from
inside of the fortress, and the Turks are
returning their fire, with sanguinary
results.
The troops who are already styled the
"corps of occupation" reached Milo to
day.
A regiment of artillery has been or
dered to start at once for the Thesaalonian
â frontier. This regiment will be accom
panied by Prince Nicholas, King George's
third son.
LONDON, Eno., Feb., 14.â The Stand
ard to-morrow will publish a Constantino
ple dispatch saying that the impression
prevails in diplomatic circles there tbat
the opposition to the Greek national senti
ment will endanger the Greek throne.
Mr. Gladstone to-day telegraphed to the
Chronicle the following message:
"I do not dare to stimulate Greece when
I cannot help her, but I shall profoundly
â¢rejoice at her succeas. I hope the powers
will recollect that they have some charac
ter to redeem."
The Daily Telegraph will publish to
morrow a dispatch from St. Petersburg
saying that the military division of Odessa
will concentrate 5000 Cos-acks, with a view
to being in readiness to meet any emer
gency tbat may arise.
MALTA, Feb. 14.â The three British
gunboats sailed hence for Greece to-day.

London Journal* Concur 7ha: There Will
Rti a Gr'co-Turiiish Conflict.
LONDON, Ekg., Feb. 15.â The London
papers this morning concur in the opinion
that a Greco-Turkish war is imminent.
The Liberal organs impJore the Govern
ment not to impede the action of Greece
In any way, while the more moderate
Journals urge the powers to occupy Crete
and to decide the ultimate destiny of the
island when matters shall have become
more quiet. The Standard declares that
the powers mast pacify Crete, since
they have decided to restrain Greece and
Turkey.
The Times publishes a dispatch from
Canea saying that George Berovitcn
.Pasha, the Christian Governor of Crete,
Mook refuge on the flagship of the Russian
J&dmiral and that the entire force of Mon
tenegrin gendarmes which have hitherto
been em ployed in guarding the Governor's
residence have been transferred to the
Russian warships. The Russian and
French admirals, the dispatch says, have
received identical instructions, but the
nature of their orders is not known.
The diplomats at Constantinople have
The San Francisco Call
accepted Great Britain's proposals for a
jo nt naval occupation of Canea, Retimo
and Heraklion, the removal from Cretan
waters of the Greek tiVet and the forbid
dance of the dispatch to Crete of Turkish
reinforcements, and it is thought proba
ble that the orders of the French and
Russian admirals are in accordance with
the programme.
The refugees who sought shelter at the
Greek Consulate have been placed under
the protection of the British Consul. The
Greek Consul at Heraklion embarked
upon one of the warships after requesting
the British Consul to protect the Greek
subjects there. The closing of the GreeK
consulates indicates that a definite rup
ture lias taken place between Greece and
Turkey.
The Times will print a dispatch from
Canea to-morrow saying it believes that
Berovitch I-:isha left aia post without per
mission.
Tiie Times also prints a dispatch dated
Canea, February 14, midnight, saying that
a Turkish troopship has just put to sea
and that a Gieek warship has started in
pursuit of her.
CANEA, Crete. Feb. 14.â The resigna

COX CERT OF THIS POWERS.
They Will Deride to Prevent Greece From
Ocr.ttppinff Crete.
BERLIN, Germany, Feb. 14.â The last
conference between the powers concern
ing the new complications which have
ariÂ«en in retard to Crete point to an im
mediate concert of action to restore order
in Crete and restrain Greece from further
pursuing the course she has taken, which,
if persisted in, must inevitably result in
hostilities be; ween the kingdom of the
Hellenes and the Turkish Empire, which,
it is believed, without the ultimate inter
ference of the powers, could have but one
outcome, the defeat and humiliation of
the former.
As the situation appears now it is proba
ble tbat foreign occupation will be decided
upon, which has lately caused an increase
in the gendarmerie on the island and the
co-operation ot the foreign fleets con
trolling the ports.
Among the numerous communications
bearing directly unon the Cretan situation
which have passed during the last week is
a letter from the King of Greece to the
Emperor of Russia, in which the King ex
plains to the Czar that the action of
Greece in sending a flotilla to Crete was a
demonstration necessary to the preserva
tion of internal order. The King states
that he is no longer willing to trust to the
powers for justice in respect to the de
mands of Greece in Crete. Though the
situation has created a feeling or alarm in
some quarter?, those entertained in official
circles, throughout the continent that Euro
pean peace will be maintained aro becom
ing strong through the belief that what
ever hghtin; may occur will be locanze.i
and tinaliy die out as the result of its con
tinemeut to small limits.

The Greeks of San Francisco are deter- I
mined to stand by the mother country !
in the eveni of a war with Turkey. All of
them have more or less money, and every
man who hails from the home of Socrates
is willing to spend his last cent in defense
of the home country.
A meeting was held on the water front
yesterday and considerable money was
subscribed toward the relief of the suffer
ers in Crete. The name^ of the commit
tee, with M. D. Vamvales as president,
have already been published in The Call,
and all sympathizers with the cause of
Greece shou.d communicate with them.
Before the trouble arose in Crete the
Greeks of San Francisco and British Co
lumbia were anxious to form a company
and go to Cuba. Now the company is
formed, and on the first note of war the
members will sail for Europe ana an
nounce to King George that they are will
ing and ready to strike a blow for the
fa r . henand.
"We are the walls of Sparta," said a
Greek, with flashing eye, yesterday.
"Every man is a brick, and every Drick

BACK TO THE FATAL SCENE.
Although M. Navok Was Separated From
Justice by the Ocean He Returned
and Was Arrested tor Murder.
WICHITA, Kans., Feb. 14.â After being
for years a fugitive from his native coun
try, whence he fled to escape military
duty, M. Navok, a Bohemian, finally sei
tl-'d in northern Oklahoma. Hii cousin,
likewise a fugitive, lived near him and
about four years ago the two quarreled
over a woman whom both of them loved.
Navok stabbed his cousin to death and hid
the body in a well. His neighbors grew
suspicious and the officers began to in
vestigate the disappearance of his rela
tive. Navok sought safety in fli*nt before
the body of his murdered relative was
found, and did not stop until he had put
the ocean between himself and the scene
of his crime. He returned under an as
sumed name to his native country, but
Government spies recognized him and he
was again forced to flee to escape pnnith
ment for desertion !rom the army. Drawn,
as he declares, by an irresistible impulse
lie returned to Oklahoma, and no sooner
had he arrived there than he waa arrested
for his cousin's murder. The woman for
whose love his cousin was murdered had,
in the meantime, married another.
Navok is a fine-appearing, well-educated
man and has money. He seems like one
dazed and it is believed by many that he
has become insane. His bold return
created a sensation in the community.

SUNDAY RACING
CAUSES A BREACH
Western Wheelmen About
to Go Out of the
League.
Receot Decision of the National
Assembly Means Two Sepa
rate Bodies.
Delegates We eh and Kerrigan of
California Can See No O:h-r
Course Open.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 15.â A special to
the Tribune from New York says: There
will be a division of the racing interests of
America inso two separate bodies within
the next three months. This division will
be the result of adverse decisions of the
National Assembly of the League of Ameri
can Wheelmen on the Sunday racing loea;
option question.
California sent on three able delegates
from her northern portion to bring about
favorable action on her request, wbicn
was made without a threat of what might
happen. Two of these delegates â Robert
Welch, the California member of the
racing board, and Frank Kerrigan, one of
San Francisco's judges, chief counsel ot
the North California division and presi
dent of the Bay City Wheelmen of that
city â were seen in New York to-nighi and
gave out the following interview:
"We do not see how a division of the
League of American \Vheeimen racing in
terests can well be avoided, now that the
question of Sunday racing has been so
disastrously settled .'or the coming season
by the assembly. We cannot see that
there is any possible way in which that
action can be annulled, and the fact of the
matter is that we do not aivise the tracks
of Northern California or the West to stay
in the league. Our fight was made to the
best of our ability and lost because the
members of the assembly thought more of
what Deople might say than of the rights
in the matter.
"We lost the fight through the failure
of Mr. Potter to keep his promise to turn
over to us forty-five of the votes of New
York State in return for the seven votes
of our division, the Louisiana vote and
that of Oregon and Washington. We car
ried out our compact and New York did
not keep its promise by a loner way. We
voted lor Keenan who was on the Elliott
ticket, for first vice-president, in thtr ex
change for that State's vote on the ques
tion that interested us, and there we got
thrown down.
"Now ii is a case that lies with' the
track-owners of tne preat West, and we
think that they will at once make prep
arations to go out of the league. Nothing
will be done in â¢ hurry iv the matter.
Our country's great need is Sunday sport,
and other portions of the West are like
situated in this matter. Tbe National
circuit will start in California just the
same, and there will be over a dozen days
of racing between tbe 20: h of April and
May 10 when the circuit chafers leave for
tbe East.
"The Eastern racing men will be given a
grand time when they do come to Califor
nia for the spring races, for it will be two
year? before they can come again. Tbe
National Assembly will, we aie sure, at
tbe next meeting adopt the measure for
tbe success of which we were sent East
and we will then regain our old places in
the controlling body.
''Meanwhile it will mean a separate body
and that hody will be well and ably man
aged, tbe rules being quite as strict in all
respects and similar to the rules of the L.
A. W., except that prize limits may be
raised and the principal part of the rac
ing will be on Sunday."
Kerrigan and Welch left for the coast
to-day and say that they wilt do all they
can do consistently to prevent the ruption,
but they must go with the majority in
this matter and the majority can lake but
the one stop.

LAST OF A BAD
GANG IN JAIL
Harry Davis Betrayed by
His Brother to the
Police.
Was the Only Member of the
Notorious Stratton Band
At Liberty.
Having Made His Way to Freedom
by Bribery H? Continued a
Criminal Career.
DENVER, Colo., Feb. 14.â The last
member of the Stratton gang of robbers,
tbe toughest and smoothest gang of crim
inals known in the West for many years,
now lies in the Denver City jail, betrayed
to the officers by his brother. This rem
nant, Harry Davis, is wanted in North
Baltimore, Ohio, for the murder of Night
Watchman Joseph Baker on the 21st of
last June.
Davis was not one of the original Strat
ton gang, but was admitted after the last
breaking up of the outfit by the arrest and
imprisonment of several members. His
qualities of toughness and his expertness
in all kinds of crime led Bob Curry and
Doc I-.ee, two of the men who bail escaped
incarceration for long periods, to pick him
up. They were operating through Ohio,
and one night tried to rob the postoffice
at North Baltimore. They were discov
ered by Omcor Baker and killed him in
attempting to escape. - The three were
taken to the Toledo (Ohio) jail,
whence Lee and Curry were sent last De
cember to the Ohio penitentiary for life,
but Davis had previously bribed two ol
tae guards and was allowed to escape.
He escaped on the morning of Novem
ber 11, and took a train out of that town
for Cincinnati, wliere he was joined by his
brother Gus, and the two went down
through the Southern States, through
Tennessee, Alabama and into Texas, from
where they crossed over into Mexico, then
back into Arkansas and up into Colorado.
The brothers arrived here last Monday
and engaged a room on Arapahoe street,
near Twentieth, and have lived there since.
Yesterday afternoon Gus, who is a mere
lad of 20, quarreled with Harry, and fear
ing violence at the hands of Harry, de
cided to betray him to the police and he
was promptly placed under arrest.
During the extended trip the brothers
have made iir.ee the escape of Harry in
November, Gus says he has been tbe un
willing accomplice of nis brother iv a
number of crimes.
The Ohio authorities have been notified
of the capture and ne will be returned to
Toledo at an early day.
The titratton gang was one of tbe most .
desperate, bold and successful that ever
existed, but every one is either behind the
bars or dead. "Sheeney" Armstrong is
serving three years in Indiana ; Prentice
Tiller, seven years in Michigan; lorn
Boalen, two years in Canyon City, Colo. ;
Frank Bruce died in the Jefferson (Ind. )
prison; James K. Stratton is serving
twenty-one years in Canyon City; Bob
Curry and Doc Lee, life in Columbus, Ohio.

CANTON, Ohio, Feb. 14.â feunday was

home. In the morning Major McKinley
attended divine services at the First Pres
byterian Church, accompanied by Hon.
Charles A. Checkering of CopenhaKen.
N. V., and Congressman D. K. Watson of
Columbus.
In the afternoon Mr. and Mra. McKin

day visit with Mother McKinley. Mrs.
McK'.nley, who has been indisposed, has
recovered sufficiently to receive her inti

Jerome Carty, a leading patent attor
ney of Philadelphia, ia in the city to pre
sent the indorsements of Colonel John A.
Wiedensheim, a candidate for the position
of Commissioner of Patents. Colonel
Weidensheim is indorsed by Senators
Quay and Cameron and Senator-elect Pen
rose; by the Philadelphia delegation to
Congress, and by many prominent Re
publicans of the Keystone State. Mr.
Carty is of the opinion that Weidensheim
will receive the appointment if Pennsyl
vania does not secure a representative in
the Cabinet, which at present does not ap
pear probable.
It is probable t.iat Major McKinley will
go to Cleveland during the present week,
but the exact time of departure has not
been decided upon. He will be in Cleve

CANTON, Ohio, Feb. 14Lâ The people
of Canton are oeniuning preparations for a
farewell reception to the President-elect
to be held on Washington's birthday.
While his neighbors will look after the
details the whole of the surrounding
country will be included in the invita
tions, and it is expected several thousand
persons will attend.
What is bothering the major and the
committee of arrangements most is to
rind a place large enough to bold the
crowd. The reception might be held in
the opera-house, but that belongs to the
McKinley estate and it would not be in
good taste to hold it there. Tue Siarx
County courthouse is the only available
building for the function, and it is proba
ble it will be given there.

Four Armed 9Ten Relief* the Customers
of a retried Saloon:
CHICAGO, li,u, Feb. 14.â Four robbers
armed with revolvers entered J. Meyers
saloon at Fourteenth place and Newberry
avenue last night and held up the place.
The barroom was crowded with customers
at the time and the robbers ordered, with
drawn weapons, every one to line up in
the rear of the saloon and hold up their
hands. No one attempted to disobey and
while three of the men kept them covered
with their pistols the fourth leisurely
went through the pockets of each man in
line, securing several watches and some
money. He then took $15 from the cash
register and the men were driven into a
small room at the rear of the bar. After
fastening the door the robbers ran back
into the street and escaped before the im
prisoned victims could release â¢ them
selves.
An Apparently Unfounded Rutnor.
CANTON, Ohio, Feb. 14.â The call of
Hon. D. K. Watson upon Major McKin

Sherman. The Jriends of Mr. Watson
consider him an excellent compromise
candidate. The Columbus Congressman
declined to taik regarding the report and
the rumor is apparently unfounded.

WASHINGTON, D. C.,' Feb. 14.â The
Washington Times, referring to the con

stance of a sum of money received by the
officials of that society being returned to
the sender on account of the condition of
its tender being coupled with the injunc
tion thai no portion of it should be used
for the relief of Spaniards. Such a con
tribution is in no wise consistent with the
meanings and rules of the Red Cross So
ciety, which in its ministrations to the
suffering makes no distinction whatever
as to any creed or nationality, and dona
tions tendered to the society coupled with
requests that they be only used in one di

purposes of the organ ization. -..'"/V

XO SUCCOR FOR CUB ASS.
It la tiaid hat JMm Barton Cannot Vitit
7hrir Hospital!.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 15.â A World
special from Jacksonville, Fla., says it
seems incredible that Miss Barton should
fall into the cunning trap arranged for
her by Spanish Minister de Lome.
Colonel Freaerico Perez Carbo, who was
chief of General Maceo's staff, speaking of
Miss Barton's acceptance of permission
given her by Minister de Lome to go to
Cuba and form a Red Cross society, says
she may go to Cuba, but the Spanish Gov
ernment will not allow her to po out
into the country and succor the Cuban
wounded or to go into Cuban hospitals.
"Miss Barton may go to Havana," he
said, "and that is just what they want.
She may help Spaniards in their hos
pitals and assist in caring for their
wounded, but she will not be permitted to
assist Cubans."

SUCCESSFUL OPERATIC SEASON.
Metropolitan Company Coming West Be
fore Sailing tor England â Takes a
Mint to Pay Salaries.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 14. -After a
successful season of fourteen weeus the
Metropolitan Opera Com pan v will give its
concluding performance in this city Sat
urday and the big organization will pack
up its belongings and move westward for
a short tour of grand opera.
The company has appeared so far this
season in twenty-four different operas,
several of which were new to America's
lyric stage. Besides the noted European
artists heretofore identified with the com
pany, such as Calve, Melba, Eames, Nor
dica, Banermeister, De Reszkes, Piancon,
La Salle, Ancona. Campanani, etc, the
soloist corps was recently strengthened by
the addition ot Alme. "Litvenne, Mme.
Clementine de Vere, Mme. Lili Ltnmann,
Paul Kalish anJ D-ivid Bis.ipbam.
Mme. Melba, wno went to France a few
weeks ago for her health, will join the
company early in March. On April 24
the artists sail for Europe, being engaeea
to apv ear for eleven weeks this summer
at Covent Garden. London, which is to
be managed by Mr. Grau, the American
grand opera magnate. In speaking of the
season just ended Manager Grau said to
day:
"Despite the annoying vicissitudes al
most necessary to grand opera, which we
have to contend with, I can trutiifuliy say
the season has been a success financially
and artistically. Of the operas the public
seemed to prefer 'Lohengrin,' 'Faust,'
'Carmen, 1 'S.egfried' and 'Metistofele.'
We have also an organization consisting
of artists, a chorus atid ballet of 100, forty
seven on our business staff, Lbreeconduct
ors and seventy musicians, all of which
requires a fortune to maintain. The ap
preciation, however, shown our endeav
ors has been encouraging and we are al
ready arranging lor next season's grand
opera."
COLLAPSE IS rttEDICIED-
Mow the Window- Gin tit Trust May He
JJi.iMmlvect,
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 14.â The Times-
Herald says: An open market for window
glass and the collapse of the trust con
trolling it is predicted. A conference be
tween the National executive committee
of the trust and thÂ» Eastern investors and
jobbers has been called for next Wednes
day at the Hotel Imperial in New York,
and the fate of the combination hinges on
the result. If the mission of the trust
representatives is unsuccess!ul, the win
dow-glass trade may see a collapse in
prices similar to that which the steel-rail
men have experienced, as values are now
40 per cent higher than when the com
bination took control 01 ihe markets.
If the trust saves its organization it can
only be by a lowering of prices to the
Eastern trade. It is estimated that there
were in the hands of the manufacturers
and unsold March 1 at least 900.000 boxes
of glass. As the consumptive demand
since the factories were put in blast has
been practically nothing, tbe jobbers are
also as well supplied as the trade prospects
warrant. For these reasons dealers gener
ally are disregarding the notice of an ad
vance of 2}4 per cent, and say that the
trust will do as well as it can reasonably
expect if it maintains prices in view of
prevailing trade conditions. Foreign
manufacturers stand ready to supply all
wants at the announced advance, and
this robs it of its terrors with those who
are expecting an active spring trade.

objections in the family, but the young
couple went to St. Louis and were mar

IN THE DOMAIN
OF THE KAISER
Military Proceedings Code
Again Excites Official
Circles.
Berlin Season at Its Climax and
Country Aristocracy Fill
ihe City.
Brilliant Court Function Arranged for
February 24â Swindling Insur
ance Company Broken Up.
BERLIN. Germany, Feb. 14.â The regu
lations of the military proceedings code
are again attracting official and political
attention. it was predicted that tbe
lleicustag would see some perfected bill
before it during the present session, but
it transpires tbat the divergence of views
between the Federal S:ates which were
announced as being on trie point of agree
ment has become accentuated and broad
ened. Tbe measure elaborated at Berlin
confides to tbe military authorities the
preparation and control of all prosecu
tions. Bavaria and Wurtemberg object
to this and bold tbat legal functionaries
skilled in jurisprudence ought to initiate
and carry out tr.als which come under
the military procedure code.
The War Minister of Wurtemberg cams
to Berlin last week and tried to get Minis
ter yon Gossler to accept bis proposals.
The Wurtemberg Minister pleaded that
the bill as prepared by General yon doss
ier is not a reform, but a retrogressive
measure, and this is also the Bavarian
contention. But yon dossier is backed
by the Kaiser, who has particularly inter
ested himself in tne matter, insisting tbat
tbe military authorities ouent to and
must originate and control tne prosecu
tions.
It will be recollected that when General
Bronsart yon Scbellendorf resigned the
Ministry of War in August last year, his
action was partly owing to intrigues con
nected with tbe now notorious Tausch
scandal, but it was also because the
Kaiser found him taking a stand on tue
necessity of liberal reform in tbe mili
tary.
General yon Gossler, who succeeded
him, proved Limself, on his earliest ap
pearance in the Reichstag, a man after
the Kaiser's own heart â the incarnation
of unyielding temper. The bill as drafted
by yon Gossler and approved by the
Kaiser has bitterly disappointed tbe hopes
of the more moderate members of tbe
Reichstag of all pariies. in ali that re
iates to publicity of ti ials, freedom of de
fense, competence oi Judges and right of
appeal it prebenis restrictions which
make it of siuaii practical value. The late
public clamor for the limitation of mili
tary privileges which arose over the
Brusewitz case has abate. i, and tue spirit
of militarism is as brutal as arrogant.
AltnougU a year mus> yet elapse before
the present Iteicuataj; shall surcease by
limitation, internal party movements are
already afoot preparing for tbe general
elections. The leaders of the two liberal
groups â the Freirinniee Volkspartei or
Rictiterites and the Freisinnige Vtreini
gucg or Reickertneâ have made over
tures to each other for coalition on a com
mon electoral platform, but as yet have
not succeeded in agreeing. Still, in their
aims they have much in common, and
under prudent guidance could no; only be
ieunited, but could also work an electoral
campaign in conjunction with tue more
democratic Volkspartei.
From the tendencies displayed by the
various factions during the debates on
economic and financial questions, such as
the Bourse laws, protection and other
agrarian matters, it can sa;ely be pre
d.c.ed, remote though the elections are,
that the campaign will be foug ton line 3
of industry and free trade against agrari
antsm and protection. The Liberals are
absorbed by the agrarian Conservatives,
and the Fieisinnige Volkspartei and the
Socialists will lorm the opposition.
The Kaiser has appointed the most
prominent professors of tbe Royal Acad
emy to design the costumes for the fancy
dress ball fixed for F u bruary 24 at the
Royal Castle. The officers are to appear
in tbe uniforms of tueir regiments as
worn at the perio 1 represented, viz., 1797.
Thus the Garde dv Corps will wear gen
darme unitorins, and some of them cui
rassier and Cossack uniforms. For all
regiments formed since 1797 the artist
painter, gkxrbind, has designed historic
costume-*. Professor yon Heyden will de
sign the costumes for members of the
court circle, which are to be representa
tive of court styles at the end of the last
century. Count Ferdinand Herrach, the
coun painter, sketches the costume of the
Kaiserin. The Kaiser will wear an extra
copy of the uniform of Marschall "Vor
waerts," Old Blucher. Herrach s design
for the Kaisi-rin recalls some well-known
paintings of Marie Antoinette. Nobody i
attempts to form an estimate of tue cost
of this great social function, which is to
outrival in magnificence of display all
previous court letes.
The court ball which was given at the
Schloss Hall in honoi of Archduke Otto of
Austria was a grand affair, over 600 euests
having been invited. In the grand march
Archduke Oito led with the Empress, who
was attired in a eeagreen robe trimmed
with beaver at tbe bottom and sides of
skirt and upon tbe shoulders. The front
was of the heaviest brocade covered with
numberless diamonds. T c Emperor's
partner was Princess Frederick Charles,
who wore red velvet. Princess Frederick
Leopold, sister of th* Em press, was attired
in a pink satin gown with silver gray
trimmings.
Tbe season is at its climax and Berlin
society has never been so failed with coun
try aristocracy. For the lan two years
the court mourning has interfered with
society functions and toned down court
costumes. Hereafter it is ord red that
civilians attending ihe court fetes must
wear white silk escarpins (pumpi), which
go well with ordinary court dress, but aru
not liked by tbe wearers.
The Kaiser and Kaiserin are giving the
Btrlmers irequent opportunity of seeing
them, as they drive about freely in every
direction. During tbe recent coid weather
they were to be seen aimost daily driv
ing along U nter den Linden in a two
wated rig with coachman ani footman.
They always drive at a rapid pace and
seem to enjoy the exhilaration.
The recent presence nere of Count Cas
sini, tbe Russian Minister at Peking, was
overlooked by the German press. He
arrived before Count Muravieff, stayed
about eight days and dined at the chancel
lerie with Muravitff. The official bulle
tins given out by (he chancelleries men
tioned him simply as Envoy Cassini at the
end of the Hit of guests and not among
the Russian names placed after Mura-
Vlfff S.
His presence in Berlin is associated
with some important negotiations affect
ing German commercial interests likely
to be disturbed by the Russo-Chine>e
Railway. His mission it said in official
quarters to have completed work of
hi -her political value than anything
Muravieff accomplished at Paris or Ber
lin. The Chinese Minister, Chn Kung
Chen, accredited to St. Petersburg and
Berlin, reached here several days before
Count Cassini arrived.

NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 14âJoseph A.

ton, who was arrested at the Albemarle
Hotel on Saturday nig >t by central office
detectives on information wired to them
from Boston that he was an embezzler of
$8000 from Peter Charles Derieux, was ar
raigned in the Center-street court to-day.
Lawyer Richards of the firm of Coudert
Brothers moved Magistrate Cornell that
lasigi be discharged from custody on the
ground that the complainant was not in
court to prosecute charge. Magistrate
Cornell promptly denied the motion. Law
yer Richards then made another motion
for the discharge of his client on the
ground that he, being a foreign Consul,
was exempt from arrest. The magistrate
said:
"I have nothing todowitb that, as I am
omy a committing magistrate. If this
arreat was made illegally you have your
remedy in a higher court on habeas cor
pus proceedings. I accordingly deny your
motion."
Lawyer Richards, after searching the
Code, made a third motion for !he dis
char of his client on the ground that the
affidavit on which he was arraigned was
made "through information, not belief."
The magistrate denied this motion also.
Then Lawyer Richards asked that bail be
made as light as possible.' Magistrate
Cornell saM that t lie charge was so serious
that a heavy bail would have to be fixed
and he accordingly held lasigi in $10,000
bail for examination Monday aiternoon.
Everybody connected with the case re
fn ed to talK, saying they preferred to
wait until to-morrow, when Mr. Drleux
would be present.

CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 14.â The fever of
the stpe.-rail war subsided somewhat in
this district to-day, due to the falling off
in the demand and the stiffening of prices
by order of the Carnegie Company. TvÂ«
Eastern prict went up $1 to $18, and Illi

same; but no large sales were made by
either concern, unless with the injunction
of secrecy.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Feb. 14.âOffi
cers of the Pennsylvania Steel Company

speaking of the war of rates in the steel

been a change for the better to-day and
prices were steadying in the East and West.
An understanding has been reached by
tlie Cambria, Pennsylvania and Bethle

NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 14-Stny

authorized the purchase of 25,400 tons of

neer for this year's renewals, but also
availed themselves of the low price to buy
24 600 tons additional.
"Last year the prices inChicago were $10
for old rails and $29 for new ones, which
made the ratio of U. 9 tons of old for one

BERISO SB A ARBITRATORS.

Mr. Dickinson to-day, when asked for

SHERMAN IS NOT
DISPOSED TO QUIT
Will Continue to Urge a
Vote on the Arbitra
tion Treaty. .
But Ratification a' the Present
Session Seems Oat of the
Question.
Immigration, Bankruptcy, Hawaiian
Cable and Oilier Measures
Pending in Congress.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 14.â When
the Senate adjourned yesterday, after an
other afternoon of useless discussion on
thÂ« general arbitration treaty, the impres
sion bad by many Senators was that Sher
man had become convinced there was
little, if any, chance of getting action dur
ing this session of the Senate. The belief
now appears to be tt.at be will make one
or two more efforts to press a vote after
devoting an afternoon to discussion, and
tbat then, without formally announcing
his determination, he will permit the
treaty to remain on the calendar without
seeking to press it for consideration.
The friends of the treaty believe it would
be ratified if a vole could be had. But this
claim is denied by others, who, however,
appear to be better satisfied to have action
postponed tiiau to permit the bill to be
taken up now. It is now evident that a
determined effort is being made by a few
Senators to prevent ratification. For this
reason it is thought the treaty will go over
until after the 4tn of March, when there
will be abundant time for the Senate to
discuss it thoroughly while considering
the nominations the new President may
send u-..
To-morrow Chandler will address the
Senate on the resolution introduced by
him declaring tbat it is the sense of the
Senate that the United States should not
permanently acquiesce in the iingle sold
standard. Chandler is not in entire har
mony with his party on the financial
question and is much incline! to make
Himself a free lance in the debate.
The immigration bill, which has come
back from conlerencd the second time,
will not take up much of the time of the
Senate, an agreement having been reached
to vote on it on Wedne-day at 4 o'clock.
The bill as it now stands removes the ob
jec.ions raited to the first report and Las
already been agreed to in the House. It
will doubtless pass the Senate without op
position.
The bankruptcy bill is the unfinished
business, but no one beiieves there will
be any serious effort to pass this measure.
The friends of tlie voluntary bankruptcy
bill are alraid the advocates of the invol
untary plan have a major. ty of votes and
bo will talk against time, if any attempt
Is made to get a vote. The Western Sen
ators ook upon the involuntary plan as
being in the interest of the East or the
creditor class, and argue tbat their bill,
when provides for involuntary bank
ruptcy in case of iraud only, gives all the
protection to both creditor and debtor
thai either class should ask.
The Hawaiian cable bill is clamoring for
recognition, but not witn any prospect of
passing at this session. The mends of
this measure want the Senate to recognize
ti.e importance of the scheme and give it
moral support by passing the bill. ThiÂ«,
they say, will induce the Hawaiian Gov
ernment to extend the concessions already
granted to a private company and whlcn
will expire belore Congress can again have
time to consider the proposed cable
|chÂ«M.
Ti.e House to-morrow will resume con
sideration of the sundry civil appropria
tion bill. It will be in order to move that
the rules be suspended and the bill passed
without further reading or am-ndment.
Cannon (R.) of Illinois, in charge of the
bill, gave notice Saturday afternoon that
he would test the sense of the House upon
this proposition. Should thi3 motion not
prevail the bill is likely to remain the un
finished business before the House for the
re*t of the we k.
The navai appropriation bill wiil be re
ported Wednesday or Thursday. Chair
man Boutelle believes, and it will be
taken up as soon as possible.
AM RICA* LUMHt.It IS CniXA.
Great Demand for Oregon fine and
t alifornia Hedtroodt.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 14.â An
important articie of import at Shanghai is
American lumber, according to a report
from Consul-General J. Erniean at that
port just received at the State Department.
It is generally pine from Oregon, although
considerable redwood from California
nnds an appreciative market there. East
ern China is almost denuded of trees,
causing its native supply of lumber to bo
very limited. The region back of Foo
Chow furnishes cocsiderable, but it is not
suitable for building purposes in a general
sense, yet it affords the means of a large
traffic between the natives. It is from the
too Cnow re-ion that the wood for mak
ing coffins is mostly obtained, the super
stition of tne Chinese permitting only
certain kindg to be used for this purpose.
From Bunan and other parts of West
ern China large quantities of pine are cut
and rafted down the Yangtse River, but
as a rule it is of a very inferior quality.
Some wood also finds its way from the in
terior to Canton. Teak and other vari
eties of hard wood are imported from the
East Indies, Siam and Burmab, and some
pine comes from Japan. Rtcemly a lot
of railroad ties were brought from Japan
to Tientsin. Between 20000,000 and '30,
--000,000 square feet 0/ lumber were im
porteu in 189G : of whicfc 14,000,000 came
from the United States, against about
9,000,000 for 1895.
The mills for which most of this was
needed are now comdete, but more will
be needed for railroads and houses, and
Americans are advised to make an effort

The J896 Supply Is Plentiful, but tlir
Quality In I'nur.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 14.â'-Quan
tity Jarge, quality poor" is the description
of the Rhine vintage for 1896 seat to the
State Department by Consul Barlow at
Mayence. In many districts the dealers
had great dfficultv in getting casks enough
to hold the product, but the desirab.e
characteristics of the wine is decidedly in
ferior to that of other years. The 1896
wine, it is predicted, will be very light and
very cheap, and a great deal ol sugar will
have to be u*ed to make it palatable. A
general estimate of the Rhine wine crup
in recent years, in millions of gallons, is
as follows: 1896, 130; 1895, 139; 1894, 74,
and in 1893, 100.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 14.-Secre
tary of Agriculture Morton asserts that
the design of Arbor Lodge, which was re
cently the subject of some caustic com
ment by Senator Vest, was not the result
of any outlay of Government money; and
further referring to that matter Mr. Mor
ton applauds the beniricence of tne an
nual ot Arbor day, which tie says is now
celebrated In every State of the American
Union. The condemned illustration of
Arbor day, he say-, was borrowed from a

bulletin referred to by SenHtor Vest cost
the Government of the United States a

SEATTLE FORGER'S CONFESSION.
Bobbed a Friend and Passed Bogus
Checks to Obtain Money to
Squander.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 14.â Tne xnys
tery surrounding the robbery of John
Fry, who was relieved of $600 in gold by
his supposed friend, George H. Krumm,
at the Grand Central Hotel several months
ago, has been cleared away, and Krumm,
who is in jail in Seattle, has admitted the
crime. He was arrested there for passing
forged checks and confessed his wrong
doings. He says tbat infatuation for two
women, one of whom he married, caused
his troobies.
In September Krumm succeeded in get
ting John Fry to come down from Fort
Wrangel to go into the meat business
here. Fry came with $1000, but luckily
pui $400 into a Seattle bank. Just beiore
the partnership was completed Krumm
invited Fry to visit Tacoma on a pleasure
trip. Then it was that be stole the $600
from Fry's pockets. He went to Seattle
and kept quiet while the search was hot.
After that he spent his time and part of
his lii-gotten gains with his wile and Mai-
Winters.
His next move was to go to Spokane
with his wile, whom he left there, and
went to Vancouver, B. C. He worked at
Vancouver a while. He went to Olympia
last week, and was joined there by May
Winters. In order to get money he forged
checks that were cashed by an Olympia
merchant. He aad the woman landed in
Seattle w.th SO cents, and the next day he
raised $20. May got it. The following
morning he cashed more checks and then
was arrested.
MARIPOSA GROVE'S VISITORS.
Myriads of Beautiful Butterflies Make
Their Home Among the Pine
Trees.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal.. Feb. 14.â Just
back of Poini Pinos Lighthouse there is a
grove of pine trees, locally known as
Moriposa Grove, "mariposa" being the
Spanish word for butterfly. Butteifl.es
are always to be found there, but never
have they congregated in such great
numbers as are to be seen since the recent
raius. They began appearing Jast Sun
day, and their numbers have steadily in
creased until now there are so many that
they hang in great clusters from the trees
and fly about like fallin â¢ leaves in an
autumn gust|of wind. As they rest upon
the dark green of the pine needles or i.ang
from the long gray moss, they present a
strikingly beautiful appearance, their
gorgeous brown and gold wines opening
and shutting slowly against the more
somber background. Many people, es
pecially Eastern tourists, walk and ride to
Mariposa Grove to enjoy the pretty and
novel sight. The question is, why at this
particular time of the year and in that
one small area, there are so many of one
variety of butttrfly. No one has suc
ceeded in discovering but the one kindâ
that which has large brown wings dotted
with a rich yellow.

SACRAMENTO, Cal,, Feb. 14â A
special train bearing an excursion party
of 400 people, consisting of legislators and
their friends, pulled out of the depot here
shortly after 9 o'clock thi- morning and
came to a stop in the foothills at lone
about two hours later. The destination
of the invaders was the Preston School ot
Industry, about half a mile out of town,
to which they had been invited by the
trustees of the institution. Trie party
was in charge of Senator Voorheis and
Assemblyman Caminetti.
The morning opened cloudy, but the
sun soon broke through the clouds and
made an ideal day for the jaunt. At lone
the hospitable people of the town and the
trustees awaited the visitors with vehicles
of all kinds to convey them to the school.
The procession was a motley one, com
prising nearly every description of thing
on wheels, from the pliant and bouncing
buckboard to the swaying and lumbering
coach.
When all had been safely disembarked

MARIN COUNTY ELECTION CONTEST
Great Interest Evinced in Political Circle*
Because of the Intricate Questions
Involved.
SAN RAFAEL. Cat,., Feb. 14.â The
election contest brought in the Marin
County Superior Court by Adolph Sylva,
the defeated candidate for Supervisor,
against George E. Ring, his successful op
ponent, will come up before Judge F. M.
Angellotti on Tuesday. The case has ex
cited considerable interest in political cir
cles, and various questions aiising in re
gard to the purity of election laws will be
settled. Svlva was defeated by thirty-two
votes, and in due time filed notice of his
intention to contest the election, claiming
that the election laws were not carried
out properly and that Ring had violated
the purity of election act.
The case had neen on hearing for some
days before Judge Angeliotti, when oneV|'
morning the Judee ordered the proceed- Â¥*
ings stopped and announced that after
mature deliberation he had concluded
that evidence relative to the violation of
the purity act could not be urged in a
civil case against a candidate not declared
elected, ana he would so hold. The only
procedure possible was criminal prosecu
tion. He therefore ordered all evidence
touching violation of the purity act to be
stricken from the record, but at the same
time called the attention of District At
torney E. B. Martinelli to the nature of
the testimony.
Sylva introduced evidence to show that
in Bolinas precinct the election booths
were so arranged that one could easily
look over a voter's shoulder and see the
manner in which he stamped his ballot.

SAN LUIS OBISPO
In Climate, Resources and
Soil the County Is
Not Surpassed.
Gteat Stock Ranges and Fruit
Orchards Yield Wealth to
Its Residents.
Picturesque Towns Nest ing in Val
leys Between tbe Mountains
and the Pacific
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., Feb. 10.â
Chart-makers place ban Luis Obispo in
tha first rank with notable localities of
th i world. Projecting the isothermal line
westward across tbe ocean it strikes land at
Yeddo on the eastern shore of Japan,
thence on it touches Jerusalem, the
sacred city of the lard of Canaan; thence
â¢on it crosses the Mediterranean, on the
northern shores of which lie Asia Minor,
Grerce, Italy and Spain, countries cele
brated the dawn of history for their
climate, their productions, their land
scape and their people; thence on the
line crosses the Atlantic to Cape Hattere.s,
then over North Carolina, Tennessee,
Arkansas, New Mexico, Arizona and back
'to Sin Luis Obispo in California.
But the mean temperature of the six
coliiest months of the yoar is still more
satisfactory in comparison with other fa
mous places of the world. In San Luis
Obispo it is 56.15 degrees; in Santa Bar
bara, 56 55 dtgrees; in Nice, Italy, 48 45
degrees; in Mentone, France, 53.21 de
grees; in the City of Mexico, 56.03 de
grees. In a word, so far as climate goes
toward making life enjoyable San Luis
Obispo compares favorably with the most
famous localities of the world.
In soil and natural resources San Luis
Obispo may well claim to equal any other
county in the State, The topography of
the county presents many striking fea
tures. The Santa Lucia range of moun
tains, rising near Monterey Hay, divides
the county into two parts, about one-third
on the western side and fronting the
ocean, and two-thirds on the eastern side
iv the interior. But this mountain range
itsell invites consideration.
1 It is broad and comparatively low. The
general elevation is about 2000 feet. Many
parts of it have gently sloping sides cov
ered with grass and oak trees or chaparral,
and the soil is good. On the flat summits
in some parts the soil is superior. Within
tbe range are beautiful valleys and pla
teaus of excellent land. It has a pro
nounced thermal belt, covering fine bench
lands and secludd valleys, where frost is
almost unknown and semi-tropical plants
Sourish. The lower foothills are usually
broad and rolling and are separated by
small, deep valleys, in which water flow's
from the mountains.
On tne western side facing the ocean
there are no iarge tracts of level land.
Undulating mesas comprise the greater
'part. Small rica valieys Jie along tbe
streams which find thei: way to the ocean.
Ihe most noted of these is the Arroyo
Grande. A never-failing stream of pure
water divides this valley of wonderful fer
tility, unsurpassed by the soil of the Nile
Ya.ley. The yalley land proper embraces
about 13,000 acres and is about a mile
wide. Even well-read Californians who
know nothing of this valley will stare
wide-eyed over sober every-day facts of
production in this valley. The writer
himself saw carrots which weiphed 30
pounds; cauliflowers, 34 to 3B pounds; cab
bages, 85 to 90 pounds, and sunflowers
which measured 23 inches across the face.
Strawberries yield and ripen every month
in the year. But the readers' credulity is
already sorely taxed no doubt, and otner
parts of tbe cuunt;y deserve attention.
The northwestern portion ot the county
is given up mainly to dairying and raising
stock, though there are quite a number of
line old apple orchards near Cambria, and
some cherry trees also. The writer meas
ured one cherry tree which was tweniy
bix inches iv diameter five feet from the
ground. He also found apple trees a foot
in diameter, and a pear tree fourteen
inches through the center. AH these
tree* bear heavy crops. The celebrated
Hearst ranch of ~900 acres, devoted to
blooded horses, lies about two rniies from
Cambria.
Nearly all the fruits grown in Cali
fornia may be found in perfection on tne
western slopes of the mountains, and most
of them flourish even down to the shore
line of the ocean in the south ena of the
county, though but few large orchards
â¢have been planted in this part of the
county, the land, .ike the Cambria coun
try, being devoted mainly to stock-raising
and dairy farms. Tne apple, apricot ana
vroinut seem to have been favorites with
those who have put out the larger or
chards.
Grapes of the highest quality are pro
duced in abundance on the higher laiid I
nvar the mountains wherever vineyards
are to be found. The olive, the lemon and
tue oiange are urown successiuMy, and
. fiÂ«s also ripen in perfection in the vicinity
of the city.
On the eastern side of the mountains
grain-growing and sheep-raisin â¢â : . were
Tormerly and are still the chief industries.
* In early days sheep-raising was tie lead
ing business. But fruit-crowing is grad
ually displacing tbese older occupations
since this portion of the couniv is found
to.be one of the best fruit-prouueiug sec
tions in the State. Here are found Â«ome
laree tracts of level land, more especially
on the eastern side of the county. In the
vicinity of Templeton, Pasj lloblea and
ban Miguel are some of tue best of the
â mailer orchards in the State.
The olive seems to thrive here as if in
Its own Habitat, so far as one may judge
by the growth of the young trees, which
have been quite extensively planted over
a considerable portion of lhis larger half
of the county in small orchards at various
points. Apricots, pears and peaches also
grow to perfection. The prune, however,
seems by odds to be the favorite tree ol
orchardists in ail this region where it
grows with a vigor and thrift not excelled
in any part of the State and is as prolific
a bearer as the most avaricious coulu
reasonably desire.
The reader will be misled if he infers
from what has been written of this region
that it is thickly settled and the land
mostly under cultivation. Reference has
beer, made only to various settlements in
different portions of this immense tract of
country. True, the land has long since
passed into t;ri>ate ownership, but Is stili
largely devoted to pasturage.
One cattle ranpe alone is inclosed by a
"ire lence forty miles long, an average of
ten miles on each side if in the form of a
square. This is the famous Cressey cattle
ranch, which the writer parsed :n a ride
of twenty-five miles easi from Templeton
>io the great Kstrella Valley, where the
San Juan and Cuoiame .rivers unite to
form the Estrelia River, which in turn is
lost in the Salinas River at San Miguel,
twenty miles below. On this trip but lew
habitations were passed after leaving
Crtston, twelve miles east of Templeton.
Nature yet reigns supreme in silent soli
tudes Â»>f undulating plains, rolling hills
and fertile valleys in the greater part of
this eastern portion of tne county, which
is girt about on the east, the south and
the west by verdure-clad or tree-crowned >
or bald, ru^ced mountains, standing. a3
huge walls of defense for this favorite and
secluded recion.
The writer has gazed in hushed awe
from the summit of a snowclad peak in
far Alaska upon a hundred miles of ma
jestic mountain? robed in eternal ice and
snow, and has felt the all-subduing power
of nature in her unspeakable sublimity,
her enchanting distances and her mighty
grandeur, but here in eastern San Luis
Obispo he has met her in nearness, tender
ness and loveliness, with a smiling wel
come fur all who have found her at home
here and have taken up their abode with
her among these hills and in these val
leys, showerin? her bountiful gifts upon
them and crowning all with her rarest
blessing, exuberant health and a spirit of
contentment, making one long to be of
the har>T y number who have here found
prosperity and peace as tillers of the soil.
The climate of eastern San Luis Obispo
is decidedly different from that on the
western side of the mountains. There is
some frost in winter and the beat of sum
mer sometimes reaches 90 degrees, but is
not oppressive, while, the nights are cool.
Though the air is dry it has a touch of
the sea breeze, which imparts a sense of
freshness quite unlike the parch heat
of the interior on the Mojave plains. Peo
ple afflicted with asthma and pulmonary
ailments find it a most satisfactory and
agreeable climat*. Tbese climatic condi
tions make this region peculiarly favor
able for ripening anu curing prunes, rigs
and raisins in perfection. In summer
time the mornings and evenings possess a
charm seldom found elsewhere. The
bracing air and clear sunshine of the â¢
colder months give health and vigor to
the most delicate constitutions.
As already indicated, the county of San
Luis Obispo bai not reached a high state
of industrial and commercial develop
ment. This is owing to its comparative
isolation from the great thor ughiares of
travel until within a short time; but the
railroad has finally penetrated tne center
of the county, and population and de
velopments will now increase more
rapidly, particularly as land values do not
range nearly so high as in other favored
portions of the State, which will invite
thrifty settlers to locate here unless the
blight of land speculation interferes with
the settlement of the people who are con
tent with small holdings thoroughly
tilled.
Templeton, Paso Robles and San
Miguel, on the line of the railroad, are
tne chief centers of population on the
east side of the mountains. San Luis
Obispo, the county seat, and Arroyo
Grande are tne two larger towns on the
western slope fronting tbe ocean. The
chief town, San Luis Obispo, hps a popu
lation of about 3000. It is situate! near
the base of the mountain in a charming
valley, within a semi-circle of lesser
mountain peaks which stand as guard in
sentinels about the quiet little city. It is
but nine miles to tidewater in the snug
harbor, where the steamships meet the
railway train on the wharf at Port Har
ford.
Fame assuredly awaits this beautiful
little city as a place of homes for cultured
people of means and as a health and
pleasure resort On the delightful slopes
above the town some cozy homes are al
ready seen. The writer strolled in the af
ternoon up to one of these abodes of peace
and ease. Trees and vines surround it.
About the doors in lavish profusion are
flowers and shrubs in endless variety.
Tender plants from the tropics nourish
here in the open air. The noble poinsetta
is here in all the glory of its royal gleam
ing red:
Kegal In its splendid glow,
Seeming Dice to her we know,
Who in ages lon* since fled
Lifted up her queenly head
By the river of the .Nile,
Winning kingdoms by her smile,
Egypt*! sun within her eyes.
In her hair the midnight dyes,
In tier cheeks tbe sunset flame,
In her lips or deathless fame,
In the brightness of her face
All tne rIo y of her raceâ
â¢ lropatia-like to stand
Queen of all our blooming land.
But space woul i fail me to tell of the
tropical vigor and luxuriance of a scarlet
passion-vine covering t c eastern end of
the two-story residence, and of the stateli
ness of a ereat royal Gold of Ophir rose
bush, and of its charming Rive dOr
neighbor, and of the scarlet hybiscus, the
camphor and a hundred other rare plants.
I conclude by saying that I have only
half told the story of what should be
written of San Luis Ooispo County, assur
ing the reader that he will not be disap
pointed when he goes there to see for him
self, provided, only, that his eyes are
trained to see and appreciate the country.

VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. 14.â British
Columbia now numbers among Its free
miners registered at New Westminster a
real live duchess and a rich baronet's
wife. The former is Millicent St. Clair
Erskine Leveson-Gower. the youne wife of

latter Lady Ross of Croniarty, Scotland.
Both took out miners' license* by proxy,
and their names will doubtless facilitate

CARSON, Nev.. Feb. 14.â There is a lull

Most of the population attended church.
> Dan Stuart, who loves to have his mind at
ease on one day in the week, slipped
quietly into a pew in tbe Episcopal house
of worship and remained during the ser
vice unobserved by any one. When the

tained a shining gold piece.
Stuart was brought up iv the Episcopal
faith, and his calling as a promoter of

a line bass voice and joined in the singing
of the Gregorian chants with great gusto.
The kolak fiends complain of the queer,

more exposuie to tbe light, which, while
appearing very bright, is not quite so
bright as it seems. Its peculiarity is fully
understood only when the negatives taken
in it are developed and founJ to be "under
exposed." This is due to the atmospheric
conditions at this altitude.
It was odd to note that one of the first
carpenters to be hired on the building ot
the handball court at fcnaws Springs was
a fierce opponent oi the prize-fight bill.
He accepted the job at $4 a day, and when
asked to work on Sunday made no objec
tion.
Dan Stuart was paralyzed when he
started to order his lumber at being con
fronted with a $16-a-thousand rate. He
thought he was being "worked," but as a
matter of fact this has for years been the
price of rough lumber in Carson. It is
understood that Stuart will rent his lum
ber and return it, as the building is to be
| only a temporary structure. The site of
the permanent building has not yet been
selected.
The rumor comes from Reno that the
people will charge Corbett $1000 to box on
the stage, under the same law that allows
him to fight on the 17th, and if he refuses
a test case will be made. It is even hinted
that an injunction will be put on the
fijjht to prevent it for six months, but this
talk is not seriously considered. The li
cense has been issued, Stuart nas paid his
$1000 for it and lawyers say that the ac
ceptance of the money settles all further
talk. Stuart said tl.is evening that the
rumored threats were giving him no con
cern wnatever. The tight would positively
come off at the time advertised. Hia ring
would be ready for the men and the men
ready for the ring.
District Attorney McGowan of Amador
County was interviewed this evening re
garding the possibility of charging Cor
bott $1000 ii he put on a play witn a box
ing scene in it. McGowan said such a
play could not be stopped.
â¢â¢Joe Murphy was here not long ago
with 'Kerry Gow,' " said he. "It contains
a horseshoeing scene, and it requires a
municipal license in this city to rnn a
blacKsmitn-shop. As well might we rush
in and stop the play or ask the main scene
to be cut because he had no blacksmith's
license as to cut Corbett's boxing scene.
The legal principle is as old as the hills,
and has frequently been decided by the
courts."

CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 14.â A special to
the Tribune from Denver says: "I saw
pictures of particles cf Corbett's blood
and a dead man's, and I must confess
that the blood of the corpse looked the
healthier," said Bob Fitzsimmons this
evening at the Windsor Hotel, when
asked about the recent examination of
Corbett by a New York physician named
o' Bryan; who pronounced the champion
physically perfect.
Fitzsimmons arrived this morning from
Pueblo, accompanied by Dan Hlckey,
Ernest Roeber and Ed Cole. Julian lett
the party at Pueblo and started directly
for Nevada to arrange for the training
quarters. . VV
"I feel absolutely confident as to the
result of the fight at Carson," said Fitz
simmons,. "and I do not think that there
will be so very many rounds fought. â¢ Of
course, things may not go exactly as I
think they will, '\ but I will be all right
financially either way. Whether I win or
lose, I will < tour the country with my
vaudeville company, managed by Julian,
and according to my notion I will get
more money it I lose. Did not Sullivan
make money after the Corbett fight?
And look at Peter Maher, whom I licked
i in one round."
< Fitzsimmons appears to be in even
better condition than when he was here
some weeks ago, and weighs about 185
pounds. He expects to take off about six
pounds in training.
"I believe that if Erne and Dixon meet,"
continued tne pugilist, "tbe colored
man will win without a doubt, as he is the
cleverest man in his class in the world.
Sharkey and Maher? Why, Peter will
knock him out in two rounds â possibly
one. I knocked him out in the second
round in our so-called tight in San Fran
cisco, but the combination allowed him to
resume. I would not figiit with Sharkey
again, for I don't care to rapet such people,
but if I ever do meet him I'll guarantee to
kill him stone dead before he leaves the
ring."
There ha? been considerable talk in the
Eastern newspapers as to the Kangaroo
lander having dreamed that he had
"licked" Corbett, and that previous to
each of his big fights he always had the
result announced to him white sleeping.
This Fitzsimmons denies, but he says
that twice on his trip West he has dreamed
that he had beaten the champion.

BUFFALO, N. V., Feb. 14.â Peter
Maher will box six rounds with C. C.

Empire Athletic Club to-morrow night.
Maher arrived to-night and says he never
felt better in his life. Brightly Dayton,
Mahcr's manager, stated to-night that
Peter would go after the winner of the big
tigiit at Carson and would have $10,000 to
$15,000 for a side stake. Maher would also
light Sharkey at Carson if Stuait could
arrange iv Dayton was emphatic in say
ing that but . Corbett and Fitzsimmons
were afraid of the Irish champion, but
that the one who won in their fight would
be compelled to meet him or quit the
ring. The Maber party will leave here

some period of secret negotiations, the two
universities hare reached a definite under
standing, and for five years at least the
crimson and the blue will contend on
water, track and Held, just as they did in
the good old days before the breach was
made in the summer of 1395. The final
agreement directly resulted from the visit
of Walter Camp of Yale to Dr. William A.
Brooks Jr. of Harvard, Saturday evening.
After several hours' conference these two
delegates of the athletic interests of the
two leading universities signed the follow
ing agreement:
"It is hereby agreed by and between the
Harvard Athletic committee and the Yale
athletic management that there shall be
annual contests in rowing, football, base
ball and tracE athletics between the repre
sentative organizations of Yale and
'Harvard, beginning March 1, 1897, and
ending March 1, 1902, the details of these
contests to be left to the managers and
captains. It is also agreed that all con
tests with the exception of rowing races,
shall take place on college grounds and
that the net gate receipts shall be equally
.divided between the two contesting or
ganizations. This agreement ii condi
tional upon the appointment on or before
April 1, 1897, of a committee to consist of
one graduate of each university, to whom
shall be referred all disagreements in any
way relating to athletics and all questions
of eligibility. The decision of tuis com
mittee is to be final.
"In case of a disagreement between the
members of this committee it shall have
the power to call upon a third person to
sottle the particular question in dispute.
Exception to clause 1: Owing to Har
vard's present boating agreement Yale is
willing to make a thirl party in the Har
vard-Cornell race at Poughkeepsie in 1897
if Harvard so arranges.
"Yale is to be definitely informed of the
decision regarding and the date of the race
on or before March 1, 1897. If the race for
1897 is arranged Yale is to have the privi
lege of naming either .Poughkeepsie or
New London for the race of l!>98, tha races
of succeeding years to be eoverned by the
main body of this agreement. If the race
for I.*d7 is not arranged that failure shall
in no wise affect the general agreement,
and th*Â» place tor the race of 1898 shall
then be governed by the terms of the gen

The announcement of a five years'
agreement with Yale has filled Harvard
with joy. Graduates and undergraduates
at Harvard square are delighed with sÂ«o

RICHEST STRIKE
AT RANDSBURG
Ore Yielding Six Thousand
Dollars in Gold to
the Ton.
Discovery Made in a Mine That
Was Regarded as of Little
Value.
Is Owners Were About to Bond I
With Two Others at a Nom
inal Figure.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 14. -The
roosi intense excitement yet created by a
discovery in tuat camp of marvels â
Randsburg â has followed a little desul
tory investigation by one of the owners of
the Monfcey Wrench mines, which de
veioped ore capable of producing $8000 of
gold to the ion. On the day of the strike
Hit- mine was visited by over 500 people,
all anxious to get a specimen ot the rock,
which the generous owner permitted each
one to take away with him. The discov
ery was made on a location filed upon a
year ago by Oren Osborne, J. L O->borne
and Louis Maynard. They believed it a
good claim, but bad not done much work
on it, nor had they ever found much
float on its surface.
The Osborne boys were in the office of
James I*. McCarthy at Randsburg last
Wednesday, and were about negotiating a
bond on the J I C, Big Wed^e and
Monkey Wrench properties. The princi
pal value was believed to attach to the
former two, and the Monkey Wrench was
simply thrown in to complete the group.
While waiting for the papers to be made
out. J. L. Osborne took a stroll across to the
mines, which are on the hill north of the
town.
In going up the hill he found a piece of
rock weighing, perhaps, two pounds, with
gold visible all over it. lie then traced
up the hill some 300 feet and found the
ledge almost on topoi the ridge and facing
Garlock and the valley below.
The vein shows only about four inches
on the surface, but widens to double that
width at a depth of three feet, which is
the greatest depth attained. The ore is
fabulously rich and shows very coarse
gold â the coarsest, in fact, of any yet
found in the camp.
A bond for uiteen days was given on
these properties some time ago, and they
were reported sold by Attorney Shinn,
but the sale was never consummated. At
the time of this strike John Crawford hela
a written agreement to sell them at a
stipulated price, but he generously re
leased the owners from the agreement.
Crawford did, however, buy Louis May
nard's one-fourth interest in the Monkey
Wrench and Big Wedge for $1000 on the
evening of the day on which the strike
was made. This claim adjoins the Wedge
mine, owned by Rogers, Pepper and Allen
on the northeast. The Big Wedge ad
joins t*ie Good Hope on the west, the Lit
tle Butte lying immediately south of it,
while tue Monkey Wrench lies just west
of these two, adjoining about half of each.
Just south of the Monkey Wrench is the
Little Butte, and just south of this the
Ist. Charles. These mines and their con
tiguity to the rich Good Hope, Wedge and
Butte mines, now being worked, consti
tute them one of the most valuable groups
on the Rand.

I- OK A HIGHER IAHIFF.
Southern California Ornnge - Grower*
' Continw the Campaign.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. *14.â The
movement made iv behalf of citrus-fruit
culture for a higher tariff upon imported
oranges is â¢ being â¢ pushed 1 at Riverside,
Red lands, Highlands and Ontario. At a
meeting of growers held Saturday night
to hear the report of the .. committee ' ap
pointed at a previous . meeting to solicit
funds with which to send a representative
to Washington, to work for a high protec
tive tariff, the committee reported that
1793 48 had been subscribed and $203 06 of
this sum paid in. The meeting adjourned
until to-morrow, when a delegate will be
selected. There is a feeling among many
of the growers that tiie representative
should be a practical orchardist and land
owner, ana should be chosen more for his
knowledge of the business and its needs
in the way of tariff.

TACOMA'S CUBAN SYMPATHIZERS.
Spanish Flag Dragged Through the Streets
by Workingmen and Then n^
Destroyed by Fire.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 14.â About 200
workingmen paraded the business streets
in the rain this afternoon, trailing in the
mud a Spanish flag. The crowd assem
bled at the corner of Twelfth and Pacitic
avenues, where several speakers made in
flammatory addresses, denouncing Cano
vas del Castillo, the Prime Minister of
Spain, as a villain, assassin and despot,
and protesting in the strongest language
against the cruelties practiced in Cuba
and the Philippine Islands.
Resolutions were read in which regret
was expressed that Canovas coul.i not be
put under the same torture as his hench
men. Lieutenant Portas and Judge Marzo,
have put Ashen Mollas, Simhe Nias and
tne other 380 unfortunates now moaning
in the cellars of Mont Jinish Castle.
Then, amid groan?, hisses and jeers, the
Spanish flag was ignited and burned, men
trampling on the last of it as it was being
consumed.
Among many of the bystanders the
whole affair was regarded as a huge joke,
but the participants, many of whom were
well known, were decidedly in earnest.

Sholto Douglas Plans for
the Future of His
Descendants.
â¢
Should Children Bless His Home,
They Must Be Born on
British Soil.
Cause for the Hasty Trip of the Eng
lishman and His Wife to
Vancouver.
TORTLAND, Ob., Feb. 14. â Sholto
Douglas and wife a few days ago, says to
day's Oregonian, passed through Portland
on their way to Vancouver, where for the
present they are settled, and it is said that
the object of the trip was to avoid having
an heir born on other than British soil.
Gossip had it that such a precaution was
necessary to avoid compromising any
rights of a son and heir should Sholto
ever be brought in the line of succession.
The assertion that an heir to the Mar
qui -ate of Queensborry must be a native
born Uritisher was apparently fortified by
the hurried removal of Douglas and bis
young American wife to British Colum
bia. There are some peculiarities of the
old English common law relative to the
riehts of succession, such as gavelkind, by
which the youngest son instead of Iba
eldest is the heir, but such a requirement
as that which is ascribed to the Queens
berry succession is unknown to those
familiar with the common law.
The sisters of Lady Douglas, Miss
Helena and Miss Madge Addis, are at
present in this city filling an engagement.
They afe intelligent and attractive girls
and tafte considerable interest in the
Douglas family, with which they have be
come connected through the accident of
marriage. Miss Helena Addis yesterday
gave an explanation of Sholto's trip to
Victoria. She said:
"That story is partly true and partly
untrue. The reason, I believe, why Lord
Douglas moved to Vancouver was because
be preferred not to have a child of iiis
born upon American soiJ. You know he
has been rather unkindly treated by the
American press. They will remain in
British Columbia fora time â until he has
made some money â and then he and his
wife intend going to Germany, where his
mother is living. Lord Douglas is his
mother's favorite son, and she has been
anxious to have him and my sister come
and visit her. She has always written
very kind letters to Loretra."
ORANGE COUA'TI'S sUOAJt OUTPUT
A'ftarly Two Million Pound* From a
Sitirjle Factory in a Tear.
ANAHEIM, CAX.,.Feb. 14.â 1n addition
to the large beet-sugar factory at Los
Aiamitcs, in this county, another is guar
anteed at Cerritos, and two more are to bo
built â one at Santa Ana and another near
Anaheim. It will require at least 7000
acres planted to sugar-beets to keep each
factory running during the season, which
means that 28,000 acres will be planted to
beets.
The Chino factory, in San Bernardino
County, began the first year of its exist
ence by turning out 1,946,000 pounds of
refined sugar, and now its yearly output
runs up to 22,000,000 pounds. The four
new factories, one of which is more than
half finished, and articles of incorporation
filed with the Secretary of State for the
erection of another, and the remaining
two equally sura to materialize, will have
a capacity equal to that of Chino.

HOW EIGHT PEOPLE PREACHED
FRATERNITY TO TWO BILLIONS
Crusading Theosophists Tell of the Faith Which Con
siders the Beliefs of All and Exacts
, Only Tolerance.
FIRST PAID A VISIT TO
SAN QUENTIN.
Convicts Told That Their
Salvation Rests With
Themselves.
CRTJBADERS BANQUETED THE
POOR.
Over Two Hundred Men Fed an 3
Lectured on the Power of
Universal Love.
Circling the globe on a mission of love
that is what the Theosophical crusaders
ar<i doing. They have lessons to teach of
brotherhood, toleration and peace as con
ceived by the members of the Theosophi
cal Society, and they are seeking hearers
in the highways and byways. They claim
to have accomplished on their journey,
which isnearing completion, things which
will accrue to the great good of mankind.
They have hopeful projects for the future
which are rich in fraternal charity.
It was a strange audience that these
eminent exponents of the mystic faith ad
diessed yesterday, yet not strange for
these travelers who have labored much
among the lowly. True to the custom
which Mrs. Kathenne A. Tinpley, leader
of the theosophical movement throughout
the world, has observed on her journey,
she and her party spent yesterday after
noon at San Quentin.
Nearly 1000 prisoners attended the meet
ing held within the walls. Dr. Griffiths of
this City presided and all the members of
the crusading party made brief addresses.
Mrs. Tineley, who has had large ex
perience in addressing such gatherings,
made an affecting address. She spoke of
the universal liability of mankind to err,
and told the men that they had it in
themselves, by exercise of will-power and
self-control, to become better men.
At the conclusion of her address, Mrs.
Xingiey said that she would probably per
manently reside in California soon, and
then she hoped to make frequent visits to
the prison.
E. X. Hargrove spoke of the power
which each man had within himself to
ignore his surroundings and be in heaven
or in hell as the mind willed. He de
clared that men live only in the mind
and even within prison walls by the con
centration of the mind upon things noble
and beautiful a light of ]oy could be let
in upon their lives.
Other epeakers followed in a similar
strain and from the apparent interest
shown by the audience, the crusaders con
sidered the meeting a most successful one.
CROWDS IN THIS CITY.
Ten-Minute Addresses by Several
of the Crusaders.
The demonstration at Odd Fellows' Hall
in the evening was an event which will
always be a landmark in the society's his
tory on this coast. The hall was crowded
to the doors and every available nook was
tilled with extra chairs. In spite of the
extra accommodations many were turned
away who were unable to obtain standing
room. The only attempt at decoration
was an arrangement of flags of numerous
nations at tne rear of the stage and a ban
ner suspended from the speakers' stand
bearing the words "Truth, Light, Liberty
for discouraged humanity."
Gl&ude Wright orv
Modem Theosophy.
Â£. B. Rambo, treasurer of the local
branch, after a brief speech of welcome to
the crusaders, who he declared were
now nearly home from the world-wide
wandering, introduced Claude Falls
Wright, president of the New York Theo
sophical Society.
"It Is necessary in an advanced gather
ing of this kind," he said, "that what we
mean by tboosophy should be generally
understood. if you look around the
world in the present day you will fini vast
numbers of people differing on questions
of religion and daily life. We are not as
narrow as we were a few years ago, but we
have not yet realized the true philosophy.
"I suppose in this audience to-night
there are represented 100 different sects. I
think 1 could show you tnat none of you
are really standing upon firm ground.
Now is it not a fact that each one of these
is an insult to the remainder? If I
tell you this of Methodists you who are
not Methodists will smile. If I cay it of
Baptists you who are not .Baptists will
smile, but what if I go over all tDe sects
and mention each of them ? What then ?
"Let us suppose you are a little more
enlightened or broadened and will admit
that every Christian sect will see salva
tion. What of the vast hordes of other re
ligions? What of the Buddhists and the
Brahmins? If you say they are all lost I I
say it is not brotherly, and il you will be-
Here me it is unchristian.
"Is there any man Here who can answer
the momentous question, Why am I here
at all? Can any man say positively that
he is not living in a dream ?
"We of the Theosophical Society are not
at all inclined to cay this thing is true or
that thing is true, but we are willing to
consider all things. When you act hold
of any new thing we are willing to listen
to it, but all we ask of you is that you
listen with tolerance to the opinions which
others advance."
Hargrove Speaks
For Reincarnation.
President Hargrove spoke of "Reincar
nation." "Before dealing with my sub
ject to-night," he said, "I wish it dis
tinctly understood that the Theosophical
Society, as such, has no beliefs. Some
times theosophy is said to be a system of
atheism, which is absurd. Sometimes it
is said to be a kind of spiritualism, which
is not the case. Tueosophy is as old as
man himself, and no matter how far you
' will go bacK in history there yon will find
theosophy being studied. It is believed in
to-day by two-thirds of the human race.
The speaker then spoke of his individual
belief that the soul is reincarnated after
the death of the body.
"At first sipht," he said, "this' view
may be strange to many, and foolish peo
ple are apt toscoff at things which they
do not understand, and especially with
any new thing which tbey do not under
stand. Reincarnation can be proved by
simply carefully examining the known
facts.
"There is no disputing the fact that the
world looked at inexplicably is a strange
chaos. We seem to see injustice every
where. Such a well-known saying as
'The sins of the father are visited upon
1 the child,' must appall and strike with
wonder the thinking man.
"Most people here will believe in the
immortality of the sou!. According to all
great teacheis the soul is the ego. the real
man, using the corporal body. You, per
hai s, believe that it is immortal in the
future only.
''Not if you take the teachings of the old
philosophers. They teach that it extends
indefinitely into the past as well as the
future.
"The soul must have its daytime of ac
tivity and its night time of rest; just as
the day follows the night time and an
[ other day comes aeain, so after death,
! which is the night time of the soul, must
| come another day. Wnat is the object of
I life if it is not to learn how to live? Can
we learn this in fifty or in a hundred
year*? We have countless experiences
which we cannot profit by. We want one
more chance, and we will have itâ c Lance
afur chance.
"I ask you to follow me one step fur
ther â man is his own master. Is not that
a lesson which humanity to-day needs to
learn? Have we not been too long told
that man is a miserable creature born to
sin? Instead of being told that man is a
little lower than the animals, who at least
have the privilege of being born innocent,
we hold that man has a hope of risinir by
his own efforts to greater and higher
things, where he may not only be a joy to
himself, but a benefit to his fellows."
What the Grusade
J4as Accomplished.
H. G. Patterson, president of the Brook
lyn Theosopnical Bociety, spoke of the
work of the crusade.
"After leaving Great Britain," he said,
"wo went through Europe, to Africa,
India, Australia, Samoa and the Sand
wich Islands. One of the things we saw
was a great amount of suffering every
where. We have it here, but we have in
a form that bears no comparison to what
it is elsewhere. We found also a great
amount of disbelief. Why?
"Because there is a great influx of light
that allows us to see things as we never
saw them before.
"We *aw more than this. Wherever we
went, whether the people had dark or
white skins, whether they wore one gar
ment or such clothing as we are accus
tomed to, we found the same people with
the same hopes and aspirations. We
found that there is only one humanity.
"The crubade has, I believe, done its
part in the history of the world.
"The crusaders going about with no
dogma to teach have pointed out a com
mon platform upon which these little
clusters of men can stand together for a
common end. The future is coming to us.
We cannot tee it in its glory, but we feel
confident that it will transcend anything
we can ever conceive."
"J\ Blending of
Religions."
Rev. W. Williams of England spoke of
"Brotherly Love." He said, in part:
"The question will present itself to many,
'Why is an English minister seen on s
Theosophist platform?' My clerical
brethren may consider that by so doing I
am barred and banned from the church
and am something of a heretic.
"This may be, but yet I am wiiiine to
accept truths wherever I may find them
that will tend to the uplifting of tne hu
man race and the realization of a greater
and purer divinity. This is a religion
which blends and unites all other re*
ligions and makes men one whose hearts
are good and true, no matter what may be
their creeds or their exterior appearance.
It is, 1 believe, one of the teacniags of
philosophy that the universality of broth
erhood is one of those instincts which, if
rightly directed, will lead to a realization
of that day of which seers and prophets of
old have spoken when they said the time
would come when the world would be
ruled not by gold but by love.
"If you ask why this condition has not
come about before, I say that universal
brotherhood has never yet been allowed
full play. If we would that our lives
should become good and pure and harmo
nious in their character they must be ac
tuated by universal love and not by the
selfish philosophy which can be expressed
in the sneer, "Am I my brother's keeper?' "
America's Qrand
Opportunities.
Mrs. Katherine A. Tingley, leader of
the theosophical movement of the world,
spoke next.
"I cannot talk about the general theo
sophical topic which I had in mind," she
said, "until I tell you that not until I
reached San Francisco did I realize what it
was to be an American. It was not that I
believe that you are Â»ny greater than
other people, because I believe all
souls are divine, and so I cannot
call you greater than others in
that sense. But I do say you have
glorious opportunities. Here as long as
you respect the Government you can
think with perfect liberty. I tell you
there are thousands of people who are ab
ject slaves, devoid of every rieht which a
true man should have. The hearts of
Americans thrill with that spirit of free
dom and toleration which has been
handed down to them from their ances
tors.
"In nine months we have established
twenty-one National branches. One of
the things that distressed me was the
ignorance wliioh the people of India and
Egypt have of America. They know
nothing of its educational institutions,
with its industries, with its spirit of lib
erty.
"I very much regret to recur to this
matter, but I feel that I should call your
attention to the great .distress which ex
ists in the world to-day. All over â not so
much in America, but in other countries â
there is a pall. It seems to me that we
cannot make any great advancement in
the human race unless we instill into the
hearts of men a larger sense of justice.
"When each individual is dignified with
the fact that he is an immortal soul, a
part of a universal wjioia, the very idea of
it will be his inspiration to seek for better
things. If every suffering individual in
the streets to-night could realize this he
would be filled with a hope that would
carry him throngh the hardest trials.
Then there will be no drunkenness, no
crimes, no hopelessness, and out of the
chaos will rise a mighty manhood that
will raise the whole world."
Alice L. Cleather of London spoke of
"The Final Perfectibility of Man," as an
end supremely desirable and possible.
Dr. Jerome A. Anderson, one of the
most prominent of the local theosophisiÃ,
closed the evening gathering with a few
appropriate remarks that sent the people
away in a congenial mood. He was
greeted with general applause.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1897.
TO THE PUBLIC OF SAN FRANCISCO.
The significance of the present theosophical crusade in our midst
lies deeper than a superficial observer might suppose. The presence
here of some of the most eminent theosophists of the world and their
project for a temple on this coast indicate a remarkable extension of
the world religion of brotherhood. In this movement the north
stretches its hand to the south and the east kisses the west. The
Pacific shore is honored by its selection as a site for a permanent
s hrine to encourage the cult of the mysteries of antiquity. Here will
be united the gray-haired wisdom of the Orient and the genius and
energy of the golden young Occident. Hand in hand they will be
invincible and together scale the heights of true God-wisdom.

ABOUT THE NEW WOMAN
Rev. A. J. Wells Heartily
Believes in Letting the
Ladies Vote.
Thinks Tennyson's Treatment of the
Subject in Sportive Style
Is Salutary.
The Rev. A. J. Wells, pastor of the Sec
ond Unitarian Church, preached last
night on the subject, "The J^ew Woman
of Tennyson's Day and Ours." Although
he favors woman's suffrage there are cer
tain types of the new women to which the
speaker expressed strong disapproval.
"Deliver me," he said, "from the brainy
woman with a mission."
In the introduction of his sermon Dr.
Wells said: "We are to-night to look at
some phases of what is called 'the woman
question. 1 If we iink the discussion with
a famous poem it will give it interest,
while the poet will serve to shield us from
the suspicion of being impertinent. The
phrase 'woman question* is itself almost
an impertinence. Why not 'man ques
tion'as well? But it is not the business
of either sex to theorize about the sphere
of the other.
"It is rather the duty of each to secure
the liberty of both and to act on the basis
of the essential unity of life. Gibbon has
called man 'the usurping sex' â and this
is his place in historyâ and the stigma
that civilization mast still place ucon
him."
The speaker thought that Tennyson : s
half sportive treatment of the woman
question was wise, and that we are tak
ing it too seriously. In the Princess, he
Baiu, we have Tennyson's view of the inter
dependence of the Bexcs and a poet's deep
insight into this question of the day. It
has this to commend itâ it does not take
the matter too seriously. He explained
that Tennyson's final appeal is to great
nature: There are limits beyond which
plans for woman's co-operation in the
world's work cannot co.
The chief end of all women, he said, is
not the home. Woman suffrage is a step
up and deserves our support. Her votes
will represent her finer self, and, counter
acting the vicious and brutal part of the
masculine vote, will raise the virtue of
our government. He thinks the advanc
ing independence of women by making
them free from the necessity of marriage
will result in the further ennobling of the
marriage relation.

WANT THE MAYOR
TO STUDY IT UP
Big Sunday Afternoon
Meeting of the Labor
Exchange.
Long List of Merchants and
Others Willing to Accept
Labor Checks at Par.
Would Undertake City Improvements
Without Creating an Interest-
Bearing Debt.
It came very near being an overflow
meeting of the Labor Exchange that was
held at Pythian Hall yesterday afternoon.
Standing room was in demand, and the
keenest interest was manifested in the
proceedings, which were simply directed
at an exposition of the methods of the
exchange and the problem of how the un
employed of the City and of the State and
of toe country may be put to work at
good wages by thete methods.
Several members of the Socialist Labor
party were present, and endeavored to
disconcert the president by asking a series
of questions considered very hard in social
economics, but they were answered ao sat
isfactorily that in every instance the big
audience broke iuto applause.
The question of underlaying public im
provements under the Labor Exchange
system â that of issuing vouchers for the
labor and material, the vouchers to be
made acceptable in payment of taxes â
was discussed. The following resolution
was unanimously adopted:
Rttolvtd, That we call tne attention ol the
Mayor and the Board of Supervisors of t:ie
City and County of San Francisco to the new
financial system under which public Improve
ments can be made without creating an inter
est-bearing debt.
Bttolved, That under this new system there
is always plenty of money to carry on public
improvements, thereby lessening poverty,
want and distress among those who are most
useful to society, viz., the working class.
Jtetolved further, That tae Mayor and Board
of Supervisors be requested to study this sys
tem with a view of adopting the same for the
purposes above set forth.
The secretary was directed to mail the
resolutions to the members of the board
and to the Mayor and to inclose with
them a list of the business houses that
accept Labor Exchange checks at their face
ralue as being as #ood as money. The
list was printed in the form of a "Labor
Exchange directory" and includes almost
every line of business and profession as
follows:
Architect?, 1; artists' materials, 1; attor
neys, 2; bakeries, 1; baskets, 1; blacksmiths,
2; bicycle-shops, 1; boots and shoes, 2; cur
pet cleaning and laying, 1 ; cigars and tobacco,
wholesale, 1; coal and wood, 2; coffee, tea,
spices, extracts, 1; commission and produce,
2; cloth, retail, 1; cloth, wholesale, 1; crock
t-ry and glassware, 2; dentists, 1; dried fruits
and nuts, wholesale, 1; doctors, 5; dry-goodg,
1; fire insurance, 1; furnished rooms 3;
fruit stores, 2; electric works, 1; furni
ture, new and second-hand, 4; gro
ceries, wholesale, 1; groceries, retail, 7;
gloves, gauntlets, mittens, 1; household uten
sils, 2; hatters, 2; horseshoeâ¢, 2; liquors
and cigars, 1; locksmiths, 1; photographers,
1; printing, 3; picture frames, 1; portraits,
1; poultry an J game, wholesale and retail. 5;
machinists, 1; music - teacher, 1; rubber
stamps 1; restaurants, 2; sewing-machines,
1; sewing-machine repairs, 1; sign painters,
2; house Daintors, 1; shoemakers, 4; shoe
makers, wholesale, 1; tailors, 2; teas and
coffees, 2; watchmakers, 3; wagon-makers, 2;
wines and liquors, wholesale, 1; wood and
willow ware, wholesale, 1; wood carpet and
inlaid floors, 1; washing-machines, 1.
This list, President Henry Warfield ex
phdned, almost if not quite completes the
circuit of the necessities of men, so that
the holders of Labor Exchange checks are
in a position to supply their wants with
out reference to money.
As these checks come more and more
into use tne list may be rapidly and inde
finitely extended, he said. The boot and
shoe manufacturer, for instance, he said,
had visited the headquarter" at 322 Davis
street, repeatedly asking for an increase
of business through the Labor Exchange;
he wanted more of tne checks. The whole
system of contemplated municipal public
improvements, the streets and sewers, he
declared, could be undertaken through
the medium suggested, and accomplished
without a bond being issued or a cent of
debt for interest incurred.
State Organizer Clark delivered astir
ring address on the pressing need of the
reform as shewn in the vast numbers of
the unemployed and the prevalence of
distress among the poor.
"There is no reason for it," he ex
claimed, "except the inadequacy of money
to effect exchanges. The world is big
enough and fruitful enough to supply
every human being bountifully. All that
is necessary is a correct system of ex
change that cannot be controlled and
monopolized, but which is open and free
at all times. This system has been dis
covered and is embodied in the Labor
Exchange and once adopted will bring
about a condition of liberty and plenty for
all such as has never been dreamed of on
earth.
"Thi3 is no fancy, but is a fact capable of
demonstration by that which has been al
ready accomplished and is now in daily
operation in this City. If they are per
mitted the workingmen can turn this into
the most beautiful City iv the world," he
said.
It ia expected that a larger hall will have
to be engaged for the regular Sunday aft
ernoon meetings, as the interest in the
movement is spreading in such fashion
that the present quarters are already alto
gether inadequate.

Mrs. Julia Moffitt of 125J^ Rincon place,
who was arrested on Saturday afternoon
by C. P. Welch of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children, is indig
nant at the treatment she received at the
hands af Secretary Welch.
She denies having neglected or abused
her children, but, on the contrary, she
claims to have nursed them with all the
tenderness and affection of a good mother
through their recent illness.
She also denies that she it addicted to
the use of intoxicating liquor or has in
any way neglected her household duties.
She claims that she was roughly handled
by the arresting officers, who dragged her
from tier home without permitting her to
dress herself or her children, who were in
bed at the time of her arrest.
She states that she resides in the flat
below that of her mother, and that when
Secretary Welch visited her he refused
her the privilege of communicating with
the members of her family who were at
home at the time, but forced her into the
patrol wagon and had her taken to the
Central police station with her two chil
dren. They were wrapped in blankets.
She is also ignorant of who made the
MISS EDNA LISSON.
QNE OF THE PRETTY YOUNG MISSE3
of Bakersfield is Miss Edna Lisson.
The above portrait gives but a partial view
of this beautiful girl. Her mother, Mrs.
A. Lisson, vouches for the following:
About two years ago Edna was suffering
from eruptions of the skin. Her face, her
hands, her body were at times all com
pletely covered with blotches of small
pimples. Many were the remedies tried to
no avail. All kinds of soaps, ointments
and doctors' prescriptions availed not.
About this time Joy'a Vegetable Sarsa
parilla was recommended. The first bot
tle was used and the only*- change for the
better was the regularity of the bowels and
tb . e bright clearness of the eyes. After the
second bottle Edna began to get well.
She not only became strong and hearty,
but all the facial blemishes disappeared,
and is now the beautiful younsc lady you
see before you.
This story is not colored just to boom
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. The above
story is about the mildest way of telling
the actual facts concerning the blood
remedy, Joy's Vegetable SarsaDarilla.
Doctors have often been puzzled and "give
it up"-about Joy's. It is a peculiar herb
remedy. It contains no mineral poisons.
It is made entirely of heros. The only
people who speak against the remedy are
the druggists who have "A BETTER
PROFIT" sarsaDarilla. When you want a
good blood medicine that produces no
complaint against her charging her with
cruelty to her children. She says it 1*
false and can' be disproved by her neigh

CHINESE GAMBLING RAID
The Police Claim They Have
Sufficient Evidence to
Convict.
A L3rge Number of the Chiness ArÂ«
rested Were Admitted to
Bail Yesterday.
The successful raid made by the police
Saturday night under the direction of
Captain Wittman upon clubs in China
town, where gambling has been carried
on, was the biet*est of the kind since the
Chinese settled in this City. In all 238
Chinese were arrested and nearly $1300
in coin seized as evidence.
The raid was admirably planned and
executed and showed the work of a mas
ter mind tnat knows how to strike when
the necessity arises.
The City Prison yesterday loosed as if
there had been a general exodus from Chi
natown. The cells and corridors wera
filled with chattering Mongolians and a
large crowd stood in front of the entrance
waiting their turn to bail their frieuds
out. The work of registering the arrests
devolved upon Sergeant Bidwell, and ha
got through with expedition and dispatch.
Then Sergeant Lindheimer and Door*
keeper Shaw had tneir hands full in ac
cepting bail and releasing the prisoners.
They were assisted by a Chinese interpre
ter. Over half the number were released
before 4 p. m. and the work went on.
Attorney Patrick Keddy released
twenty-seven and he will defend them in
court. Fifty-two were released on bonds f
accepted by Clerk Foley of Judge Conlan'a
court. Chief Crowley warned Foley that
if the men he was releasing on bonds
which had not been passed upon by LMng
Gong, the Chinese employed for that pur
pose, did not appear in court this morning
he would hold him personally responsible.
The police say that besides the money
seized they are in possession of evidence
sufficient to prove that the law against
gambling had been violated, and that the
Chinese cannot protect themselves under
the pretext that the clubs are incorpo
rated. The police had provided them
selves with search warrants, so they were
actinp within their rights.

Dam BittersNATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
A number of the officers connected with
the National Guard visited Sacramento
during the pa-t week and appeared before
the Military Committee. They found the
members very attentive listeners to all
thai : ai to be suid in lavor of and against
the several propositions that have been
presented to the Legislature. The indica
tions are that a number of amendments
will be passed, Jsome of which will be of
benefit to the Guard, but others, if adop'
ed. will do neither good nor harm.
W'L ether there will be an encampment
or encampments this year or not is still in
the line of creat uncertainty. There is a
?trong move in Sacramento for camp sites
and it is thought that if the Legislature
gives the $40,000 a>ked for for this purpose
it wiil hoi make any appropriation this
year for encampments and trie men will
have to wait another year before enjoying
the pleasure- of a week or ten days on the
tented rield. It the meantime the men
will f.iil in knowledge of camp instruction
and will continue to confine themselves to
indoor drill.
There is a great deal of comment over the
fact tiiat the guardsmen are not trained for
btutÂ«i:iou or regimental arllls occasionally.
The men by such drills can become acquainted
â with the maneuvers that are necessary and
thoroughly understand the nature ot the com
mands that are given during outdoor evolu
tions. As it Is, they are now versed In the
thcorj of outdoor work, but they lack prac
tice and it is practice that makes perfect. Pos
sibly when "the war at Sacramento" is over,
the brigadier-generals will turn their atten
tion to that part of the school of the-soldier.
The announcement In Thi; Call last Monday
that the naval battalion at this point his
started a school of instruction for petty offi
cers and a lyceum lor the officers and men h*s
attracted some attention to a subject that
would result in a great deal of good if the
other branches of the service would follow the
example set. There is a necessity for the in
struction of the non-commissioned officers oi
the guard, and a uniform instruction at that,
for it certainly is not a credit to the organiza
tion that each officer is permitted to place
whatever construction he desires upon any
clause in the regulations.
In Illinois these schools of instruction have
met with good success and nave resulted in
improving the standard of the officers and
men of trie guard. The Illinois First Infantry
nas organized a course of military instruction
and discussion with blackboard illustration.
These Mre given twice a month in one of the
large halls of the armory.
Major-General Snowden, commanding the
Pennsylvania Division of ihe National Guard,
has ordered some material changes in the
drill regulations. In recent orders he soys:
"Funber exercise in the extended order drill
is a waste oi time which enn be put to more
p:ofitable use." He has ordered that the men
shai know sometning beyond mere drill, and
has directed the commanding officers to prac
tice their troops In outpost duty, Cossack
po*;s, marching with advance and rear guards,
flankers, as it In the presence of an enemy,
and they are to be practiced in the escorting
of supply tram* and making reconnoissauces.
A little ot tiittt kind ol work for the Nations.
Guardsmen of California would make better
soldiers.
The first Brigade.
BALIKAB, CAL., Feb. 14 âThe boys of Troop
C have supplied the Armory Hall with a full
gymnasium outfit, and the armory is not only
used by the troop on drill night, but nearly
ever? night in the week some oi the members
oi the troop may be found e:ther in the gym
rasiura or reading-room, or the more musi
cally Inclined at the piauo. The armory is
fitted and suDpiied wltii Â«. ; the comfort* oi a
modern home, and is bea iqunrters for many
memcprs of the troop nearly every evening.
Tbe De pa rime nt Kucmnpment >>i tte G. A. R.
[or the States oi < aiuornia and Nevada meets
here April 21-23, and Troop t; has ranted
ov>-r tne use oi Armory Hal! to the locai com
mittee to be used by the encampment during
the week.
The regular drill night of the troop has been
changed irom Thursday night to Monday
night. The at endance at regular du.ls has
increased of iÂ«te.
. T.'.e troop ha? now taken up the study of the
manual of the ca'b'.n^, their attention having
been given mostly to ihe sword practice here
tofore.
The horsemen of Monterey County have
agreed to donate horoei to the troop, and
premises will either be leased or purcha>cd Dy
the troop, so that it will have
datioris for tlie horses -o donated. This will be
cif grunt advantage to the ir^-op and make
it much more efficient, lor heretofore
nearly every member of the troop has had a
o;ffprent horse every time of mounted drill,
but with the new arranxeinent we shall soon
have armed hr.se>. ns well as troopers.
Tlit- rMTontl Brigade.
It was decided at the meeting of the board
of officers of tbe Second Brigade last Thurs
day to abandon for the time being the idea of
an evolution day on the 'J2l. Instead there
will be a parade 01 the brigade on that day
and a review in this City by the Command r
in-Chiei and tne legislative committee. The
. order for the parade will shortly be issued.
No order with reference to the day will be
issued from division headquarters, so the
commanders will be at liberty to call out their
commands in honor of tl;e dm-.
The election for colonel of the First Infantry
will be held on the lltd of March. Up to date
there is no change in the condition of affairs
aÂ» 10 who may succeed Colonel MacdouaUL
tenant-Colonel Duboce will accept the
command if it comes 10 him from the officers
in such.a manner as to show that he ib the
man they want, or, at least, the great majority
want him. Ii not, he will content himself to
retain the position he has his commission for,
namely, lieuteiiani-colonel. Then the only
real candidate In the held is Major lluber,
who, it is claimed, has only the officers of two
companies that were lormerly connected with
the command of which he was major.
Tne First Infantry has concluded to accept
the challenge issued by the Filth Infantry
three week-, ago to shoot a match with rifles,
but it is with an if, and that is, thai iho match
Is not 10 < ome oil until May. The Filth does
not like the idea of such a delay and it is
j'iobnb!e its board of officers will hold a meet
ing to determine if it will consent 10 wait that
] '>'â >Â£ One of the terms of the challenge is
that no man shall be permitted to take part
in the- shoot who was not a member of the
guard on the first of the current year.
No >;. >- have yet been taken to secure a site
lor a ra^ge on which to conduct the State
shoots according to the new regulations which
are to go Into effect on the 30th of June.
There is s,onie talk about securing new quar
ters for Troop A. The commander, wants a
place where there is' sufficient space for
mounted drills.
The members of company A, Captain Con
nolly, win give a minstrel entertainment and
dance in Union-SquareHall on the 2-lth.
The Third Brigade.
FRESNO, Cal , Feb. 13.â The election in the
', Blxth Kej,'laicnt of the National Guard of Call
fornia, occasioned by the resignation of
Colonel J. J. Nunan, will be held in Fresno
next Monday evening. Considerable Interest
in the result is being manifested in this city,
and particularly among the local militiamen.
There will in all probability be three vacan
cies to till, and th> raisin center has candi
dates for every one of these, with the as
surance that two of them will be elected.
The various company officers of the regiment
who will take part In the election are the fol
lowing: From Stocktonâ Major G. G. Grant.
Captain W. R. Johnson and Captain Bruce
(retired). Lieutenants Elliott, Heath, Duffy
and Dasher. Fresnoâ Lieutenant-Colonel S. S.
Wrignt, Major Colin Chisholin. Captain George
W. Jones and Captain George O. Duncan. Lieu
tenants E.T. Wolcott, S. K. Lemon. J. M. Col
lins and J. D. Jones. Modestoâ Mor
ris, Lieutenants Johns and Freitas. Mercedâ
Captain J. R. Graham, L eutenants Smith Â«nd
Guthrie. ViÂ«nliaâ Captain Fred W. Ward,
Lieutenants Klb er and Adams. Bakersfieldâ
Captain Cook, Lieutenants Blodgett and Mun
zer.
There is little doubt but that Lieutenant-
Colonel S. S. Wright of this city will succeed
Nunati as colonel of the regiment. AÂ» yet no
opposition has developed against him, and he
stands directly in line for promotion to the
command of the regimen:. Colouel WriEht
has been connected with tne National Guard
for many years, and fully deserves the honor
which will no doubt be conferred upon him
next Monday evening. He takes a deep inter
est in military affairs, and no more capable
man to command the regiment could be
found.
Major Colin Chisholm of this city will in all
probability be advanced to Lieutenant-Colonel
Wright's present position. He is the only can
didate in the field, and his election is con-
I ceded as he is entitled to the place through
promotion.
For the vacancy to be created by the ad
vancement of Major Chis.ho.rn there are sev
eral aspirants, a number of captains would
like to be major of the Ninth Battalion, and a
lively conteft is in prospect for next Monday
evening in the election for this position. The
candidate-, bo far as known at tne present
time, are Captaiu Johnson of Stockton,
Captain Whitmore (retired) of Modesto,
Captain Graham of Merced, Captain Scribner
of Fresno and Captain Byrnes of Visalia, with
others in prospect.
The election will be held at the armory and
will be presided over by Colonel Nunan. A
full attendance of all the company officers of
the regiment is expected, and the meeting
will be quite an event in military circles of
the valley.
In addition to the election the officers will
discuss matters concerning the National
Guard, particularly in reierence to proposed
legislation for the benefit of the organization.
Several other matters of importance will come
up. Among these is the question of holding a
regimental encampment next summer.
WOODLAND, Cal, Feb. 13 âNews in mili
tary circle-, is very scarce. The company had
two good drills in the last two weeks and the
men show a marked improvement nt each
drill. They seam to be taking more interest
in the welfare of the company than hereto
fore. Forty-two men were Â«t drill on the 3d
and forty-five on the 10th.
The ball given by the company on the sth
was a success socially and financially.
Tne 300 and 600 yard ranges are us far away
as they ever were. The captain has tried very
hard to get a suitable place, but as yet has
failed to do so. He hopes, though, to have a
range in the near future. The date of the
match with the Honolulu team has not a* yet
been set, but it will be some lime uext month.
i The boys are practicing regularly and soon
j the ten men will be picked to represent this
company in the match.
A baseball team is to be organized out of
the company soon. There is plenty of good
material and there is no reason why the com
pany should not have a crack club. * The loot
ball team is practicing every day and is pet
ting in line shape. Next Sunday a game will
tie played with the Fair field team and prom
ises to be a very exciting game.
It good. howling will win a game the Com
pany F team ought to surely win. There will
De a game on the 22d if nothing prevents.
The company is increasing m membership
every week and the new members are of the
best class of men.
The Naval Battalion.
The officers of the battalion, Second Division,
have been notified that there will be an ex
tended order drill and battalion inspection
to-morrow evening on the Spreckel- dock.
The battalion has not received any order
from division headquarters to parade on the
1 22d, and as uo order will be issued from bead
' quarters it is probable that Lieutenant-
Commander L. H. Turner will order his com
mand on board of the Cnmanche ana have it
inspected by the Legislative committee, that
will be in the City that day to inspect the
Second Brigade.
Lieutenant-Commander Turner will shortly
leave for Los Angeles, to be present at a session
o) the examining board. Great preparations
are being made for his visit, as it will be the
first that the division in the southern part of
the Stata has received from the commanding
officer. _________________

A THICK MIST
Many Riflemen Make Many
Poor Scores at Shell
Mound.
The Wet Weather Prevented
Good Work With Rifle
and Pisto'.
Cash Pr:z s Prcv a Great Attraction
in Three Clubsâ The Musket
Shooters
Shell Mound was the scene of much life
and activity yesterday. Riflemen from
all directions congreeated at the range to
compete for cash prize*, medals and hon
ors, and from early in the morning until
dusk there was a deafening roar of tire
arms. The weather was very bad, for a
drizzle or Scotch mist fell continuously
and clothed the targets in the distance
with a blue haze that made very good
shooting almost impossible. But tbis did
â¡ot discourage the marksmen â nothing
doesâ for they banged away in spite of the
difficulties, and a few managed to run up
scores tliat they were not ashamed of.
There was a large outpouring of the
members of the Columbia Pistol and Rifle
Club, and there was a keen rivalry for the
possession of goad scores, particularly in
all of the re-entry matches, as there are
valuable medals and cash prizes on each.
In order to aiioot under the best possible
conditions nearly all of the Columbias are
searching for the very best ammunition
money can buy. Many Have adopted a
combination that gives good results. They
load their shells with a nitro-powder prim
ing and the body of the charge of black
powder. This prevents fouling and in
sures reenlarity.
Of course mtro primers are necessary.
Thus by degreei the marksmen of rifle
and revolver are working toward the new
ntro or smokeless rifle powder.
A. H. Pane is determined to win the
Bushnell ntie medal, and he has a splen
did start on this race. F. O. Young and
F. H. Bushnell had a lively race in the
afternoon for high score in the Glinder
mann military medal match, and the for
mer was successful only by a Creedmoor
count. Botti made 47.
C. M. Daiss is back again with the rifle
shots. For two years he had devoted his
energies to pistol shooiin.-, and with
ma need success.
On the 50-yard pistol range there was
good shooting at times when the weather
cleared. A. B. Dorrell in revolver prac
tice made the bÂ«-st six-shot run ever shot
on the range, 20 points in six shots, Co
lumbia target. That is averaging to place
six shots in a 3^-inch circ.e.
More revolvers are in use now than for
years past. For the first time in rifle club
history on this coast the ladies shot on an
equality with the men, ladies having been
admitted to full membership. The high
est scores made on both ranges, Columbia
target, were at follows:

SPOKE ON THE BIBLE.
Mrs. R. S. Lillie's Address Before
the Society of Progressive
Spiritualists.
The Scriptures, She Says, Support
Spiritua ism and Tell of Its
Phenomena.
The Society of Progressive Spiritualists
held services at Scottish Hall, 105 Laricin
street, last evening. Mrs. R. 8. Lillie of
Boston spoke upon "The Bible and Spirit
ualism." She was introduced by Presi
dent Rider and spoke substantially as fol
lows:
Spiritualists as a rule search everywhere^for
truth and unbind shackles. They treat "the
Bible rationally with the mind free on this as
on any other subject. The parent church-
Catholicismâ held in its charge the Bible in
its oiiginal form. Its books were written
thousands of years ago by authors whose
names are practically unknown. It has been
taucht that the Bible was the very word of
(jod. It is now known that it i> of human
origin Hiui contains many imperfections.
The Bible, as some one has said. Is like an
old fiddle, you can play any tune on it; and
we can play Suiritualism as well as any other
tune. We will lake the lirst few chapters of
the book and find that the first spiritual
seance was the one held^on Mount Sinai. It
was a slate-writing and trumpet seance. The
law was written on tablets of stone up there
on the mountain amid the thunders and light
ning, by the hand of Jehovah himbelf. Spirit
ua ism lms taught from its inception that it
was wrong to kill. Human life should be held
sacred and as a most precious gift.
Christianity claims to nave done much for
the elevation of woman, and yet It teaches
that she is the author of evil and the source of
sin and death in the world. Spiritualism de
nies the slander and claims the equality of the
sexes. By and by we shall know how to rear
children from the foundation so that crimln
a.s shall not be born. Jails and prisons will
be vacant and insane asylums tenantleas.
Next Sunday tne subject will be, ''Spir
itualism, the PerishaDle and Imperish
able." _

NOT IN FAVOR
OF RECIPROCITY
Viticulfurist Bowen Thinks
That It Would Be
Ruinous.
Says Chicago His Been Selfishly
Dickering Wi h France and
Germany.
One of the Leading Qnestions to Come
Up at the Wine Convention on
Tuesday.
At the Viticaltural convention to be
held in tbe Chamber of Commerce to
morrow the active wine men will discuss
many questions of local importance.
Amon gthese are tliejtariff, tbe bottlinp'of
brandies in bond and i c possible reci
procity of France and Germany as to wines
and brand es.
Speaking of the lntter point Charles E.
.Bowen, a practical vineyardist, said yes
terday:
"The question of reciprocity with France
and Germany as to wines and possibly
braniiies is one of the most important that
has been brought to the attention of viti
uultunsts and wine merchants since the
California wine industry assumed any
commercial proportions. A careful can
vass among tbe wine merchants of San
Francisco and of those wine-makers of the
interior of the State who have visited the
City within the p tst ten days convinces
me that an organized effort should be
made at once to stave off any movement
looking toward reciprocity with the coun
tries named. Many of tbe merchants and
growers evince a genuine alarm at tbe
situation which has recently developed,
and justly so, it seems to me.
"The present movement looking toward
reciurocity has its origin with the leading
packet s and meat shippers of Chicago.
For a number of years it has been their
aim to ship their meats and provisions to
Germany in particular, and to a less de
gree to Fiance, under more favorable trade
conditions than now exist. With this
end in view they are working to have re
ciprocal inducements offered to the Ger
man and French governments, and have
selected wine as one of the articles which
those countries can ship to the United
States at reduced rates of duty or none at
all. These meat men have an enormous
influence both in Washington and out,
and as the trade of Germany and France
in their lines can be built up to millions
of dollars annually in value, they will
naturally ex><rt all their influence to at
tain their ends.
"I do not believe that the majority of
California wine-growers realize wiiat reci
procity with Germany and France would
mean to them. For many years they
have made little or not ing from ihe
products of their vineyards. It is only
within the iast two years that vineyard
property has become of any commercial
| Viilue as an investment, and now It is pro
posed to open our American wine niar-
I kets to French and German products for
i the bent-fit of a few Chicago millionaire
butchers and pork-packers.
â 'Some years ago when new wines were
selling at the vineyards of this State at
from seven to eight cents per gallon, and
there was a general over-suppiy of wines,
an experimental shipment of ten carloads
of wine was made to Cette in France. The
wine was selected solely because it was
high in alcohol and big bodied and was to
be used in blending with the lighter French
growths. Even at the low price of seven
or eight cents per gallon to tbe producer
it was found that the trade could not be
made to pay tbe shipper, as cheap Spanish
and Algerian wines (red wines ior blend
ing) could be bought at a les3 figure than
the California wines laid down in France.
"This condition still exists in France to
day. I quote from Le Moniteur Vinicole
of January 22, 1897. giving the following
market report of blending wines atÃcrcy,
the greut entrepot for wine 01 Paris.
This market report is as follows:
Buyers are few. some speculators are offer
ing at this time Algerian wines at 21 francs
and even 120 lraucs per hectoliter without
much success. However, slocks are low, and
it will soon become nece: ? sary to replenish
ihriii. At this moment wines may be quoted
as follows:
Aramon 24 to 29 francs per hecto'lter
Mm* rvols -7 to 'i'l traucs per hectoliter
.Montagu.- i! 7to 3J francs per he tollter
r. nil -si urn -5 to 35 francs per nectolker
Algerian 20 lo i.'7 fiancs per hectoliter
P.HS---B mrgogne. 25 lo 30 francs p*r hectoliter
1 ouralne 25 to Hi) francs per hectoliter
i iii-r -" to 32 traucs per litc.o.icr
"California wines if sold in France
would come in direct competition with
the heavy Algerian an:l Spanish wines.
Estimating the franc at 18VÂ£ cents and the
hectoliter at 26% American gallons, we
wouid thus get nearly 14 cents per Amer
ican gallon ior our wmes laid down in
Bercy, this beiug tbe same price as now
quoted for Algerian wines. Practically
the same price would rule at Cette, Mar
seilles, Bordeaux and other wine-blending
centers of France.
"To arrive at a proper estimate of the
price wiiicb wou.d be realized at tbe Cal -
iornia vineyards, we would have to deduct
at least 4 cents per gallon for cooperaee, 3
cents at a low estimate for freight, and
other charges for insurance, commissio; s,
etc. All things considered, we would be
lucky if under the blessings of reciprocity
we obtained Gcei.ts per gallon for our new
wines, and all to suit thewishesof achque
of Chicago millionaires. Our vineyardi^ts
and winemakers are now holding out for
20 cents per gallon. How do they like the
prospects under reciprocity ?
"This is but half of thestory. Our wine
shipments to the Eastern States in 1896
were about 15,000,000 callous. The total
value of our wine and brandy shipments
was ciose to ($8,000,000. In the same year
me imports ot French and German wines
in bulk at New York were as follows, ac
cording to Bonfort's Wine and Spirit
Circular:
Bordeaux and Burgundy 274, 150 gallons
Cette (French) 1M, 565 gallons
German and Hungarian 681,180 gallons
"This takea no account of the wii.es im
ported in cases.
"If French and German wines were ad
mitted into tbe United Stales without the
payment of duty (for this 1 is what reci
procity means), we would at once lose our
large markets in New York and New Or
leans, to say nothing of other cities, on
account of the cheap price, at which
French and German wines could be sold
and on account of the existing prejudice
against domestic wines and in favor of
the imported. We would become reduced
Ito the necessity of competing in tue
foreign markets for the sale of our wines
as blending material, exactly as the Span
iards and Algerians are doing to-day. In
other words, our industry, instead of being
fairly profitable, as it is to-day, would be
simply ruined.
"Tuis, then, is the situation confront*
ing us.
"Wtia* is to be done?
"That will be discussed at the conven
tion to be held Tuesday. In past years
matters of National legislation were at
tended to by the late Viticultural Com
mission, but it iÂ« no more. Governor
Budd, in bis desire to abolish 'useles com-
I missions,' succeeded in having it done
away with after compromising with its
members, although he afterward signed
bills creating more commissions, as wit
ness the State Bureau of Highways and
the Code Commission. Liberal-minded
men in the industry, ho wever, uayo seen
to it that an industry which represents
$60,000,000 in capital shall not be jeopard
ized in Washington. They recognize
that their business, though considered
legitimate in California, is condemned by
public sentiment la some other States
and for this reason they will have more
difficulty in securing justice than the
fruit, wool and other agricultural tailings
oftheS'ate. It behooves every vijrneron
to inierest himself in this movement and
to use bis influence and contribute his
share toward having proper representation
at the National capital.
"The timt) is short. The Ways and
Means Committee of the House of Repre
sentatives is meeting daily for the purpose
of preparing a tariff and revenue bill to
be introduced at the special bession of
Congress, which, if report be correct, will
convene on March 15.
"We ought to be represented in Wash
ington now, and I trust that we will be
before it is too late. Every merchant and
grower is interested In this matter and I
hope that before ten days pass by the wine
industry will have such representation as
us importance deserves."
D. O. MILLS IS IN TOWN.
The Miilionair- Owner of Mills Build
ing and of .Vi libra* Arrives From
New York.
Among the arrivals here yesterdny from
the East was D. O. Mills, the millionaire
wlio lounded his fortune in Sacramento,
who has his headquarters in New York,
who is building two large economical ho
tels in that city, who owns the Mills
building in San Francisco, and who owns
a country home in Sun Mateo County at
Miilbr.ie, which is named after him.
Mr. Mills came here by way of Arizona,
where he spent a few days, as is his cus
tom, in visiting his son-in-law, Whitelaw
Reid, at his winter borne. Mr. and Mrs.
Reid will shortlr come here to visit at
Millbrae, where Mr. Mills will spend his
time unul April.
Then he will start on his return to New
Yorfc. He will arrive there just about the
time that his large hotel is completed and
ready to be opened for the 1600 roomers it
is designed to accommodate. The sepa
rate apartments are small, Dut furnished
with all moiern conveniences, including
electric light and artificial heat. They are
intended lor men, and together witti board
will cost the individual less than 50 cents
a day, though equaling the accommoda
tions to be had at ordinary hotels. Rooms
will be rented by the month. Mr. Mills
says that the enterprise is not intended as
a money-making scheme, but that it wili
pay expenses and provide neat sanitary
quarters for men of small moans. Such
hotels, he thinks, would pay expenses in
any large city.
An to the financial outlook, Mr. Mills
declares that there will be an awakening
immediately upon the arrangement of the
National income with respect to protec
tion.

THE FAKE JSD THE FACT.
THE FAKE
The Examiner published for several days at the
top of its title page the following fake:
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
249,757 Inches
Of Ads During 1896.
5964 More
Than were published by any
other San Francisco newspaper.
In the publication of this fake the Examiner
was probably not aware that a careful record was
being kept of the actual amount in inches of Its
advertising and thai in consequence It could be
confronted with the following fact.
â THE FACT
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
236,528 Inches
Of Ads During 1896.
That is one fact and here is an-
other :
THE CALL PUBLISHED
239,551 Inches
Of Ads During 1896.
3,023 More
Inches were published in
THE CALL than in the
Examiner during 1896.
It Is to be remembered that during 1896 the
Examiner published approximately 800 inches of
Illegal lottery advertisements, of which The Call
did not and would not publish one.
The monarch of the falters has doubtless suc-
ceeded In securing thousands of Inches of adver-
tising during the past year by dupinx and deceiv-
ing advertisers through false and arrogant asser-
tions of the character of the foregoing fake. It
would seem, however, from the facts tbat the
merchants as a rule have not been misled by its
iraudulent pretenses.
The Examiner boasts that Its books are open to
Inspection, tint we suggest that it Inspect Its own
rooks before it venture) UDOn the publication of
another fake.
We congratulate the public on the fact that the
rxrosure of this fake led the Examiner to drop 1L
In this the Examiner was discreet, and if It is wise
li will make no more such bold attempts to
ri twelve the public.

It is stated that the number of persons

It is said there are 8000 families in want
of bread in Chicago, and yet the bins of the

The dramatic critic of the Boston Herald
asserts the people in that city have
adopted a fad of applauding everything in

ing a performance just to show their style.
A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.
The investigation of ike question of water rates will be taken up by the Board of
Supervisors again this evening, and will be continued at tri-weekly meetings as long
as may be necessary for a full and official ascertainment of the facts essential to a just
regulation of water rates.
The right of the people of any community to inquire into the equity and fairness
of the rates which corporations holding public franchises for the supply of such neces
saries of civilized life as water, light and the like are entitled to charge the in
dividual user has been conceded by economists and established by law. The statutes
of the State of California provide for such annual statements on the part of water
companies of their properties, business and income as may enable Boards of Super
visors to determine whether their water schedules are fair and just.
It will be seen at a glance that in this matter each municipality stands alone in
the midst of its own conditions and that the rates rightly chargeable in one section
are little guide to those which the water company of another may be entitled to
receive. This being so, there is all the more reason why the investigation of water
rates by our Board of Supervisors should be so complete, detailed and exhaustive
that the schedule which they finally agree to fix shall satisfy the public mind as
being fair and just.
It is to be expected that the Mayor and Board of Supervisors will enter upon and
wiil conduct the present investigation in tne spirit above suggested, and that during
its progress they shall keep themselves above the suspicion of either dishonesty or
demagoguery. To a man of large and diverse interests and of wide culture liKe
Mayor Phelan, the first of these vices is not supposable, and the second of them ought
to and doubtless is detestable. The members of the board have thus far escaped the
imputation of either offense against their oath of office, and it is to be hoped that the
present investigation shall give no ground for public belief in the existence of either.
The dishonesty of the demagogue is hardly less in degree than that of the bribe
taker and is much more dangerous to the health of the body politic.
In the matter of the pending inquiry into the equity of existing water rates there
is no necessity for hysterics and no place for a aisplay of the soap-chewing tactics of
the demagogue. It is the duty of the Mayor and of each and every member of the
Board of Supervisors to bring to the subject that sober and practical sense which they
employ in their personal aftairs; to require from the water company the same sort of
detailed statement which they would receive from their agents, and to apply to the
whole matter those practical rules of eveiy-day business â which govern the subject of
capital in its investment and in its rightful, reasonable and just returns.
AN AMERICAN CAUSE.
Before the present week closes the work
of organizing a movement in this City for
the promotion of the cause of free Cuba
should be virtually completed. We should
put ourselves into line with the other
cities of the Union and pive evidence not
only of our sympathy with the Cuban
people, but of our determination to aid
them by every lawful means.
The cause 01 Cuba is the cause o! Ameri
ca. Tue struggle oi the Cuban patriots is
the same as that which our forefathers
waged apainst England in 1771j. It is
another effort on the part of an American
people to emancipate themselves from
European control and establish their right
to self-eovernment.
The time has come when all America
should be free from the domination of the
Old World. We may concede as much as
can be justly claimed by the older nations
of what is due to (hem for colonizing this
hemisphere, but such claims cannot go to
the exient of a right to perpetual govern
ment over any part of our continent or
their adjacent islands. America is of
right entitled to self-government, and no
European power can seek to dominate an
American country any more justly than
the United States might seek to conquer
and annex the territory oi some of the
weaker nations of Europe.
The United States is not an aggressive
Nation. We do not make war lor the an
nexation of territory or for the power of
domination. We have never sought to
take from any European country any of
its possessions iv our hemisphere. We do
not seek to do so now. When, however,
an American people revolts against Eu
ropean control and shows through years
of war its ability to maintain itself avainst
all the power of its former musters, then
it ia not only our right but our duty to
intervene and give to the struggling pa
triots the aid necessary to re-establish
peace within their borders.
If Spain had any possible cnance of re
asserting her supremacy and her laws in
Cuba there might be reasons why we
should hesitate to interfere in the war and
put an end to it. It is certain, however,
that Spain cannotconquer Cuba. All that
she can do is to destroy property and
shed blood. We have therefore the com
mon right of humanity as well as the po
litical right of an American people to in
tervene and compel Spain to retire from
this continent and leave the Cubans free
to govern themselves.
San Francisco if she stood alone could
not do much to promote the cause cf Cu
ban independence. She does not stand
alone. Nearly every city of note in the
United States has organ. zed a committee
to promote the cause, and we will be but a
co-operative force with others when we
begin the work here. It is right and fitting
that we should manifest our willingness
to co-operate in the work, and before the
week closes we should have made it evi
dent that we intend to do so.
A FARMERS' CLUB.
Asa result of the Farmers' Institute,
held in this City, it has been decided to
organize a Farmers' Club to be made up
of residents of San Francisco. The de
! cislon is in no way surprising, it is known
j there are more farmers, vineyardists and
orchardists living in the county of San
Francisco than in any other in the State.
It is natural, therefore, that these should
unite and organ ize, as have done the farm
ers in other cities, in order to advance
their welfare by discussions and by organ
ized action where sucn is necessary.
Since such a club is to be organized, it
should be the aim of the promoters to
make it of more than ordinary strength,
vigor and importance. A club of farmers,
resident in the metropolis, can be of great
service, not only to its own members, but
to farmers throughout the State. As was
stated by Alfred Hoiman at the session of
the institute on Thursday evening, a San
Francisco Farmers' Club could aid in the
establishment of a satisfactory market for
rural products, and could also facilitate
the exchange and dissemination of current
new?, which would be of great value to
the farming industry.
Mr. Hoiman pointed out an instance of
recent occurrence where such a olub
wouid have been of great benefit to the
farmeis. The wheat-growers of California,
be said, failed to profit by the recent rise
in wheat because, though the circum
stances which led up to it were known to
a few persons here and to the department
at Washington, there was no way in which
that knowledge could be conveyed to those
most vitally interested. If there had been
a strong Fanners' Club here, with special
sources of information, the farmers would
have been benefited to the extent of a sum
I so large as to be difficult to estimate.
The proposed club begins under propi
. tious circumstances. The men and women
| who have started the movement and given
iv their names as members are persons of
influence and energy. We can reason
ably look forward to good results from
their work, and may, therefore, in all cer
tainty count on a Farmers' Club as one of
the established institutions of .the City.
It is altogether right and fitting that the
banquet to be given Judge McKenna
should be a non-partisan gathering. The
guest of the evening will represent all
California in the Cabinet and *all Califor
nians are ready to congratulate him on his
selection.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1897.
SECEETAEY MOETON.
Of ail the members of the Cleveland
Cabinet the one who has been the subject
of most adverse criticism is the Secretary
of Agriculture. This fact is due mainly to
the personal defects of the Secretary. The
business of his office has little or no re
< lation to the great issues which divide
I political parties, and therefore if he had
acted with an ordinary degree of prudence
and sagacity be could have gone through
his term with no partisan denunciation
and little or no condemnation from any
class of the people.
The first Secretary of Agriculture, Mr.
Rusk, made the office one of the most im
portant in the Cabinet and won for him
self in the condnct of its affairs sucn a
reputation among the people as made him
a prominent candidate for the Presidency.
His successor, Mr. Morton, has been the
opposite of all that made Secretary Rusk
popular. lie has attended more to poli
tics than to agriculture, has engaged in
more forms of "pernicious activity than
any other Cabinet officer on record, and
has either injured or irritated every farm
ing industry in the country.
Some illustrations of Morton's lack of
official propriety as well as of political
sagacity were given in the debate in the
Senate on Wednesday on the agricultural
appropriation bill. Senator Vest pointed
out that among the agricultural bulletins
sent out by the Secretary were a number
which from so far relating to matters of
agriculture were not only strictly political,
but were of the worst kind of partisan poli
tics at tbat. Ha noted one in particular in
which the Secretary had arraigned the
people of the States which were carried by
Bryan as ignorant and illiterate. The
statements made by the Secretary in this
bulletin were accurate enough, Dut cer
tainly they were not matters of agricul
ture and were not calculated to give in
struction to farmers or to advance farming
interests.
Another foolish bulletin contained a
picture of Secretary Morton's country
residence in Nebraska, and was made up
of an address which the Secretary had de
livered at a college before he had entered
the public service. Senator Chandler
called attention to s till another of these
agricultural bulletins, in which the Secre
tary had turned aside from farming and
proceeded to discuss the financial ques
tion. Senator Stewart declared the Secre
tary to be "the most picturesque specimen
he had aver Known." Thus one after
another Senators of all parties united in
giving a severe roasting to the extraordi
nary egotist who for four years has been
posing and drawing pay as Secretary of
Agriculture, but who has done nothing In
the office except to irritate the country by
repeated demonstrations of his disregard
for public welfare and his seeming con
tempt for everybody who disagrees with
him on any subject whatever.
THE SONOMA PAIR.
The county of Sonoma has long since
demonstrated that the northern citrus
belt has advantages peculiar to itself
which are in no wise inferior to any pos
sessed by the southern counties. This
proof is to be confirmed and made amply
manifest in the citrus fair which is coon
to open. All reports show that the dis
play will be one of tne best ever made in
the State and fully equal in many respects
to any which has been exhibited at River
side, San Diego or Los Angeles.
The cultivation of oranges in Sonoma
was at first treated as a joke, and when
the orchardists of the county showed that
they intended it seriously, many people
regarded it as a hazardous experiment.
Both the joker? and the doubters, how
ever, have now been silenced. Sonoma
has shown that it can produce oranges of
the finest quality and in large quantities.
It has entered the market as an orange
producer, has drawn therefrom large
profits and has every prospect of larger
profits in the years to come.
The display to be made at the coming
fair will serve to demonstrate something
more than the ability of Sonoma and the
districts around it to produce oranges.
It will make evident the fact tnat the
foothills of California are far richer than
has been generally supposed. They pos
Â«ess a soil equal to the best and have a
climate which can hardly be surpassed.
It would be b,ard to set limits to the va
riety of productions which may be ob
tained from all the lootbill region, when
thorough and comprehensive experiments
have tested and made known the utmost
which can be produced there.
There are other counties in Northern
California which can profitably imitate
the example set by Sonoma. It needs
nothing more than well-conducted ex
periments to sbow that they also may
make themselves rich in orchard products
of all Kinds known to the temperate zone.
The display to be shown at the coming
fair will tend to encourage the making of
these experiments la fruit-growing in
other sections, and it is safe to predict
that ere long the northern citrus belt will
be as prosperous and as renowned as that
of the south. Such fairs are benefits to
the whole State, and should be liberally
patronized not only by the people of the
section where they are held, but by the
State at large. Certainly the people of
San Francisco should do much to promote
and advance them, and every one who can
afTora it ought to visit the Sonoma fair
and extend to it the fullest patronage pos
sible.
COASI LXCHAhGES.
The Hollister Bee has changed hands, Harry
Johnson retiring from its editorial manage
ment, and being succeeded by Edward Series.
The policy of the paper remains the same.
Angels Camp is being agitated on the sub
ject of incorporation and the Mountain Echo
is earnestly pleading with the people of that
prosperous mining town to move in the mat
ter without delay, to the end that many
needed public improvements may. be the more
speedily secured.
The Fresno Expositor has begun war on the
Chinese lottery games of the Raisin City. It
remarks that conservative estimates of the
amount drained from that cUv annually into
the coffers of the shrewd heathen sharps,
place the sum at no less than $400,000. The
Expositor should be commended for its stand
in behalf of law. ;. > '
The Merced Star having recorded the fact
that one of the citizens of that city owned a
hog which weighed 350 pounds at two and a
half years of age, the Los Banos Enterprise in
dulges in a stage laugh and speaks thus;
"William Birch, our lumber-dealer, has a
Berkshire only fourteen months old which
weighed one week ago 506 pounds. Size ud to
that with your Merced River porker."
The Santa Cruz Sentiml is jubilant over the
prospect of the establishment of a woolen mill
in city. It says: "Colonel Humbert, who
desires to establish a woolen mill in this city,
wants a donation of land besides buildings
sufficient to accommodate machinery for the
manufacture of 100 pairs of blankets daily.
An effort is now being made to comply with
the terms upon which Santa Cruz can secure
the mill. Already the F. A. Hihn Company
has offered to donate two acres of land on
River street and 75,000 feet of lumber- W. H.
Lamb, who has the matter in charge, says
that offers of land, money, material and labor
will be accepted." -.
Los Gatos wants a new drainage system, a
new Town Hall and an electric-light system of
her own. In order to get those things the
Mail favors the issuance of bonds. It declares
that "the people of Los Gatos to-day will favor
anything in the bounds of reason that will
tend to better the condition of the place ; any
legitimate enterprise that will have a tend
ency to give employment to the unemployed,
to enhance the value of our properly, to bring,
capital to the place and to put Los Gatos where
she has been and where she belongsâ the
foremost rank of the live* interior towns of
California."
The Santa Monica Outlook, in its 1897 special
edition, has outdone all its previous efforts
and has issued a number that will compare in
general excellence with the best product of
any paper outside the big cities. Its illustra
tions are superb, and the printing and paper
first-class. The history of Santa Monica is told
in a manner full of interest, and many an
Easterner will open his eyes in wonderment
as he reads of the transformation of a sheep
range into one of the Eden spots of California.
Editor D. G. Ho.t has earned distinguished
praise by that edition, and his work, will be of
great benefit to Santa Monica in attracting at
tention to her numerous advantages.
Auburn wants a cannery. The Argus of that
place observes that all indications point to a
splendid fruit crop in the coming season. The
paper continues:
"It is early to talk of this, but not too early.
The tun will very coon begin to 'ride high,'
and his mellowing influence will bring the
blossoming and the fruiting before very long,
and every element of economy calls for a can
nery as a necessary adjunct to the fruit in
terests of our county.
â¢'Another thingâ Auburn should develop a
'pay day' of good dimensions. Every month
brings to Lincoln through her pottery and
cannery (in the season) a very well padded
pay roll. The same is true of Rocklin,
through her roundhouse and her quarries.
Auburn must try to develop something to
correspond with her sister cities. A few
thousand dollars to well-paid' laborers every
month in a city like ours is a consummation de
voutly to be wished. In what better way can
this be attained at present than by opening a
cannery?" - : â '- ;" ; * i ''>\v""
The Wstsonville Pajaronian, in its interest
ing "Sugar Beet" items, Informs us that "the
last beet of toe campaign went into the mill
elevator last Saturday afternoon, and the big
whistle proclaimed the end of the cutting sea
son. A large part of the mill crew was laid
off at the close of the week, only enough be
ing retained to handle the closing syrup. It
is expected that the last of the sugar will be
run out to-morrow. It has been a long and
successful campaign. The mill handled a
greater tonnage of beets than ever before, and
the production of sugar was over 50 per cent
I greater than the big run two years ago. In
mill and on. fields the run and season were
about as perfect as they could be, and the re
cord made is apt to be a star ono for years.
Tne crop of 1894-05 was surpassed by the
1896-97 crop, the latter beinjt about 10,000 tons
greater. In sugar showing the difference was
more striking, the crop just milled showing
7000 tons of sugar in excess ot the crop two
years ago." ____^^^_^^^____^

The first lot was snipped to the Palmer yard
February 9, 1850, and 200 tons, ranging in
thickness from 3 to 4^ inches, were delivered
in seven weeks. The plates went on the floating
ironclad battery called the Terror.
Japan intends to spend a vast amount of
money in establishing or extending dock
yards at Hyogo, Moji, Uxaga, Hakodate and
Yokohama. The latter is well advanced
toward completion. Twenty million dollars
have already been expended on the harbor at
Osaka, which is ol great military importance.

The Russian Naval Reserve is, so far as the
personnel goes, in a very unsatisfactory con

Minister of Marine had heard about the
Reserve and wanted to set) what it was like, so
1 he Issued summons for eighty-Mx men to

reported, and of this only eleven were able to
speak their own language fluently; fifteen

Swedish. As a result of the examination,
only eleven men were accepted by the Minister
of Marine at lit for service in the navy.
The sinking of the French torpedo-boat No.
86, in consequence of & collision, is the fourth
boat of that class which has had bad luck.
Sixty-three of these boats, ranging from 54 to

1885 and 1892. Their contract speed was
twenty knots, with 520 horsepower, but the
first lot of thirty-five boats were found too
slow, and heavier boilers were put in. This
reduced their stability and led to accidents.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS
For a day or two past it has been rumored
that the distinguished Japanese naval officials
who arrived here recently to supervise and
partly superintend the construction of the
new Japanese cruiser at the Union Iron Works
had bad a row with the Scotts and the contract
was off. It was said that the gentlemen from
the land of the chrysanthemum were very
hostile indeed.
No interview could be gained with the naval
officials, and for a little while it looked as if
it might be true. But Lieutenant Kro Aoki of
the commission came to the front yesterday
and denied it utterly. He is at the Occidental.
"The Union Iron Works," he said, "is build
ing us a cruiser of the same class as the fam
ous Yoshlno, used in the Chinese-Japanese
LIEUTENANT KYO AOKI of the Japanese .Naval Commission, Who Is Watching
the Work on the New Cruiser at the Union Iron Works.

will be about 400 feet long.

the others of the commission. Work has only
just begun and it is going along very -well It
will take about two yean ft> complete her. It
is expected when she is finished she will be
one of the finest ships afloat.
"There are four of us who havo been sent to
note the progress of the work on this ship and
the one the Crampt are making in Philadel
phia. Myself and T.Tukakura are to attend to
the latter vessel, which is also to be a cruiser,
and S. Sakura and Y. Wadogaki are to specially
follow the work here.
"We are now having three cruisers built in
England, one cruiser and fouror more torpedo
boats in Germany and two cruisers in France.
"The work on the cruiser here is progressing
steadily. We are getiing nothing but the fin
est of war vessels. After we have been here
a while and visited the East we will probably
go to Europe.
"I have no idea yet what we shall call the
cruiser that is being made here. It is too
early." __^_____^__

And said s' ed ever cling to me

ARBITRATION WiTH ENGLAND
OtFR Actual Experience With Efropean
Umpires.
Army and Navy Journal.
We observe that Ex-Senator Edmunds says:
â¢â¢The third and last objection to the ai bi tra
tiOQ treaty I have heard is the supposed dan
ger of leaving it to any European power to
name an umpire in certain contingencies. It
is enough to say that, so far as our consider
able experience has gone in such matters,
we have never had occasion to complain of the
action of auy sovereign in naming an umpire
or in deciding a dispute."
Mr. Edmunds' recollections are certainly
very much at fault in thi9 case. We had the
most righteous reasons for objecting in the
case of the selection of the third Commissioner
to determine the fisheries dispute. By the
twenty-third article of the treaty of Washing
ton it was agreed that the question as to the
amount of money to be paid by the United
States for the alleged excess in value of what
they received over what they gave should be
referred to Commissioners, one to be named
by eacn party, and the third by tne President
and the Queen conjointly.
li was further agreed that if the choice of
the third Commissioner was not made in three
months he should be named by the Austrian
Minister in London. Earl Granville insisted
that the choice should be referred to the Min
ister of the United States and the Minister of
England at the Hague to see if they could not
agree upon "some Dutch gentleman " This
was a clear departure from the treaty and
would, as Mr. Fish allowed, require the con
clusion of a new treaty in constiu t onai fom
before the proposition could be assented to
by the United States. He added that "it is
deeply to be regretted that her Majesty's Gov
ernment has made no effort to comply with
that provision of the twenty-third article of
the treaty, whereby it was agreed that the
third Commissioner should be named by the
President of the United States and her Britan
nic Majesty conjointly."
By this subterfuge, for it can be called noth'
ing else, Great Britain threw over the selection
of the Commissioner to the end of the three
months, and then insisted that the Austrian
Minister should select him. He selected Mr.
Delfosse, the Belgian Minister at Washington,
the representative of a kingdom owing ita
origin to the armed interposition of Great
Britain, and its continuauce to ber friendship
and favor; a kingdom ruled over until within
a few years of that time by Leopold, the uncle
of Queen Victoria, the father of her husband,
Prince Albert, the son-in-law of the Prince
Regent of England, and a marshal in the
British army. King Leopold was in the yearly
receipt of $250,000 from the British ex
chequer, and was naturally on the most
affectionate terms with the Queen of England
and was her confidential auviser.
This selection threw two of the three arbi
trators into the hands of England. Such was
the "impartial" tribunal to which was re
ferred the fisheries question. As a result we
were obliged to pay in money or remitted du
ties $9,700,000 for fishery rights that belonged
to us already, and whicn were not in any case
worth over $1,500,000, estimating mackerel
at the extravajan' price of $10 a barrel. As a
matter oi fact they were not worth half a mil
lion. Mr. Edmunds must be familliar with,
these facts. How can he, in view of them,
say: "We have never had occasion to com.
plain of the action of any sovereign in namÂ«
ing an umpire or in deciding a dispute."
In view of past experience are we not quite
right in objecting to the selection in advance
of a minor European sovereign as an arbi.
trator between us and Great Britain concern
ing we know not what? If we will put our
Heads into the lion's mouth in this lashion v,q

Letters From the People.
CUBA AND THE CUBANS*
The Standard of Intelligence Higher on
the Jtland Than in Spain.
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear tin: In view
of recent events the following may be inter
esting:
The Cubans who are fighting are not "mostly
half-breeds." The population of Cuba is 1,000,
--000. of which 65 per cent are white and 33
per cent colored and Chinese (Gaceta Official
deHabana, 1890). The island is divided into
six provinces, viz.: Habaua. Matanzas, Plnar.
del Rio, Santa Clara, Puerto Principe and San
tiago de Cuba. At the head of each province
is a -Gobernador civil," appointed by the
Spanish crown and subordinate to the Uov
ernor-General, who is the Viceroy. Each of.
the provinces sends two Senators to the Span*
ish Cortes, who are elected under manipula
tions of the royal rulers, who take good cara
to return only desirable parties. The Univer
sity of llnba.ua and the Royal Economic Soci
ety each elect an additional Senator. Cuba
as Cuba, has no real representation in the
Cortes.
As between the oppressor ami the oppressed
the factors of intelligence stand thus: In
Cuba 35.11 percent whites and 12.28 percent
half-breeds can read and write, while in Spain
I the ratio of adults to total population unable
I to write is 72 per cont.
Cubes' autonomy is far from being ridicu
lous. Some of the brightest men in Spain, sucb,
as Castelar and Morel, advocate it.

WERE IN COMPANY
OFF CAPE HORN
i Nordlyset and the Black
braes Had a Hard
Time of It.
I Che Put Into Port in Distress
and the Other Had H r
Cargo Heated.
Arrival cf tha Mail Company's City
of Para From Panama and
Way Ports.
1
The Norwegian bark Nordlyset and the
J British ship Blackbraes, now in port, had
I a bard time of it on the way here from
I Europe. The latter had tv out into a South
American rort and discharge part of her
cargo, while Nordlyset was in a num
ber of storms and had several narrow
escapes. Off the Horn the two vessels
! were in company and the accompanying
sketch was made from a description fur
nished by Captain K. P. Olsen of
Nordlyset, showing his vessel speaking
the Blackbraes.
A smarter or prettier vessel than
Nordlyset never came into port. She was
as trim as a yacht before the work of dis
[ charging coal began and even now the
] captain's cabin looks more liuo a drawing
! room than a master's quarters aboard a
regular trader.
Nordlyoet is just six years old and
j this is her second trip to San Francisco.
; The last time she was here she loaded
! wheat for Manchester and was one of the
| Brat vessels that unloaded above the
j bridges. From Manchester Nordlyset
went to Ardrossan, on the Firth of Clyde,
and there loaded coal for 6nn Francisco.
When IS7 days out the Blackbraes was
sighted, but at that time me ship was
not thought to be in danger. Later on,
however, she had to put into Montevideo
ana discharge part of her cargo.
NorJlyset has not always been as
fortunate as she was on this voyage. Two
years ago her coal cargo caught lire and
nearly 2UO tons of it had to be thrown
overboard before the vessel was out of
danger. During the trip just ended the
cargo heated, but Captain Olsen was able
to use the ventilators in such a manner
as to obviate all risk of the coal bursting
i into Dime. Nordlyset belongs to the
sine company that owns the Breideblik,
Viidanden and other well-known traders
, to fcan Francisco.
Captain K. F. Olsen will be remembered
j as me ma>ter of thtt ship Gerda that was
j wrecked on Sable Island. "We had a ter
| rible time of it," said the skipper yester
! day. "I knew we were off the coast of
I Nova Scotia, but just where I could not
j tell until Bable Island loomed up before
j us. A few minutes later we struct. Su- j
j perintendent Butelier of the life-saving j
; station was on watch all night and the
next morning he had the live-saving ap
paratus in working order and we were
i taken off. The Gerda went to pieces, but
I we were saved antf in consequence there is
not a sailor who was on tne vesso! but
who has a warm spot in his bosom for the
life-saving men."
Nordlyset is not chartered and the
chances are that as soon as she finishes
discharging at Beale street she will go to
Oakland Creek and will there lay up until
the new wheat crop comes in.
The Pacific Mail Company's City of Para
got in from Panama ana way ports yester
day. "There is no change in the situation
in San Salvador, Guatemala, or Nicar
agua." sad the purser of the steamer yes
terday. '"The people are too busy to fake
any interest in politics just now. Toe
coffee season is in full blast, and as it is
unusually heavy there are not enough
men to harvest it. In ban Salvador there
ara no laborers, and the overflow Chinese
and Japanese in San Francisco would be a
godsend down there at the present time.
The crop 13 a particularly good one, and
the City of Para is almost entireiy loaded
with the stuff."
G. M. Hersey, general secretary of the
Young Men's Christian Association lor
the New England States, was a passenger.
He was landed early in the day and at
once went to Y. M. C. A. headquarters.
He is here in tne interest of the Christian
Kndeavor Convention and will make all
the necessary arrangements for the com
fort of tne delegates that will come from
Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massa
chusetts, Connecicut and Rhode Island.
The City of Para has over 1700 tons of
cargo in her hoid and the bulk of it is
coffee convened to the Eastern markets.
The landinc-float at Folsom-street wharf
is in a dangerousccndilion end the sooner
vis repaired the better. During the last
storm the swinging steps broke away
irorn the wharf, and now whenever any
man or woman has to use the landing
they have to make a break-neck jump to
the ladder or clamber up on hands and
knees to the wharf in order to make con
nection.

this office was not prompted by necessity,
but rather was designed tor the particular
benelit of Mr. Wagner, as a reward lor his
past services on behalf of the Board of
Health. These allegations are wholly
E. L. Wagner, the New Inspector
of the Dependent Poor.
denied by SuDenntendent Reddy of
the Alrushouse and by Mr. Wagner
uimseif, who Doth state emphatically
that the office has been rendered necessary
by the continual increase in the number
of the Alms ho use inmate?, many of whom,
it is suspected, are not justly entitled to
live at the expense of the city. To this
category belong military pensioners, luna
tics and alt those who have relatives and
freinds well ab e to contribute partially if
not entirely to their support.
It will be the duty of the inspector to
determine as to the eligibleness of all ap
plicants for admission and in this way, it
is argued in defense of the appointment,
a great saving ia likely to bÂ» effected In
the administration of the affairs of the in
stitution.
"1 know very little about Mr. Wagner
myself," said Superintendent Reddy yes
terday. "He was sent here by the Board
of Health and he seems to me a very able,
energetic and honorable man. It is
claimed that he belonged to the Solid
Seven in the last Board of Supervisors.
All I know is that he was one ot the few
Democrats elected, and that being so I
fail to see where be got his pull, if it is
true that be made such a good thing out
of bis position I can't see why he should
desire an office of this kind.
"1 can state with regard to the office
itself that it is by no means a sinecure.
We nave 042 inmates at the present mo
ment, and the heads of the various de
partments have enough to do to look after
them in the ordinary sense of the term.
Mr. Wagner's duty is to investigate the
antecedents and circumstances of new
comers, and particularly whether they
have any relatives able to take care of
them. Neither the Mayor nor his clerk
Uas time to attend to these matters, and
something must be done to check the in
crease in the number of inmates. We
have nothing to say against the admission
of those who are really deserving, but
there is no reason why the City should
support impostor"'.
"The Board of Health considered that the
creation of an office of this kind would
eventually result in a saving to tbe city.
Neither my cierK nor I have time to run
down town continually to institute the
necessary investigations. Mr. Wagner
has been in constant attendance ever since
his appointment and is likely to prove a
valuable acquisition to the staff.
"Anybody at all familiar with the sub
ject must know how rediculous it is to
suppose that lam responsible for the at -
pointment. I merely obey the instruc
tions of the board and did so in this case.
The board appoints everybody from my
self downwards, and it is, therefore, ab
surd to say that either Dr. Morse or Dr.
Hart urged me to appoint Wagner. As to
the Jatter's predecessor in oflice, Mr.
Boyle, I certainly discharged him because
j saw fit to do so. but was not then aware
that Mr. Wagner would be his successor."
Mr. Wagner also had something to say
regarding the much-discussed appoint
ment and the alleged causes thereof.
"It is not true," tie said, "that my cast
ing vote gave the $30,000 appropriation to
the Board of Healt , because there were
more than seven votes in favor of it,
Furthermore, the appropriation was given
in good faith, and might even have boen
greater than it was with advanta c. The
board has done its duty in protecting the
lives and the health of our citizens, and
in my opinion at least double the amount
should have been given to it There ought
to be four ambulances instead of two, and
the scope of the board's activity should
not stop short at tue inspection of the
milk supply, but should extend to all de
partments of food production.
"The position of Inspector of the De
pendent Poor is a real necessity. It ena
bles us to discover the relatives of the un
fortnnaie inmates, and in cas* of death
preserves many of them irom a pauper's
crave; by which means a great deal of
money can be saved.
"Then, too. if there are people out there
living at the expense cf the (jovernment
as pensioners.the fact should be known and
they should be expelled from the Alms
nouse. Insane persons", also, belong prop
erly to the asylums, which the city helps
to support. My duty as Inspector also ex
tends to the supervision of the wards, and
to seeing that the rules providing for the
comfort of the inmates are adhered to. I
have attended to these duties from 8 to 5
o'clock ever aince my appointment, and
any statement alleging otherwise is un
true. The appointment was made by the
Board of Health, and Superintendent
Reddy had nothing to dc with it. The
recommendation came from Dr. Hart and
Dr. Morse, those gentlemen, no doubt,
consinering that I wasquaiitied to fill such
a position, while as a Democrat it was
only natural that the. boardâ other things
being equal â should favor that recommen
dation.
IDLE OHEISTIANS.
ReT, Dr. Spalding Asks "Why Spend
Ye AH the Way Idle?"
The Rev. Dr. Spalding, rector of St.
John's Church, preached last night about
idle Christians. The gospel for the day,
''The vineyard and the laborers," sug
gested the theme. The text was, "Why
stand ye here all the day idle?" The
doctor stated that in one sense no one
could accuse our people of idleness. All
around us is the hum of busy life. But
worldly industry and Christian idleness
may go hand in hand. "Is it so with any
of us?" Merely earthly aims he said end
with the grave. The stiffening fingers
cannot draw a check upon the million* it
once controlled. But death cannot close
work for God. For the salvation of our
souls and the souls of others we must
weed out the vineyards of our lives. Bo
assured some enemy has sown tares in
each of our lives.

lief I hud long been seeking. 1 am nearly 70 years of age, and like many other men have
burned the candle at both end?, and up to a short time ago suffered the consequences. lam
proud to say your belt has cured me after the failure of nil other remedies. Among ona of the
worst features of my troubles was constipation, but by the use of your belt my bowels are
again normal; also my stomach. My sexual power has returned and 1 feel liKe a new man In
every respect. The above is but poor praise to express my gratitude to you and your Belt for
the good you have done. I will be pleased at any time to interview those who may wish to in-
quire what your treatment has done lor me, and remain, your* very truly,
JESSE M. SMITH, E street, Pico Heights.
IT IS AN INVIGORATOR.
For young men, middle-aged men, as well as old men, the life-giving power gen-
erated by this wonderful Belt is the grandest of ail benefits. To feel the life blood
flowing through your veins once more, to knon that years have not brought declining
power, to know that the hands on the dial of life nave been turned back a score of
years! Wiiat a precious thought 1 Man, if you appreciate but the half that this
famous Belt has done no man would longer endure the lacK of the power of manhood.

Music, Oratory and a Ball Will Be
Striking Features of the
Day.
The St. Patrick's day convention at
Knigut'Bof Red Brancti Hall yesterday
afternoon was largely attended and con

arrangements for a grand celebration on
the 17th of March.
The committee on music, speaking and

the members for some time with songs
and recitations and Patrick Nichols re
cited an Irish patriotic poem.
Speeches were made by a number of
delegates and all favored making the
demonstration this year greater than
heretofore. All of the local Irish societies
are working for the success of the move
ment, and the convention will be in ses

THE CUBAN LEAGUE
IS GROWING FAST
Letters Come In and Com
mitteemen Are Added
Each Day.
A Los Angeles Sympathizer
Tells of Interest in the
South.
The Local Organizatkn Will Probably
Be Perfected in Every Detail
This Week.
The committee of organization of the
Cuban League will go forth to-day to add
new names to its lists and perfect the local
society. The progress of the. past week
has been great and it is believed that an
other week will add hundreds of names to
the roll. â¢â¢ -
"We have received a ereat many new
names for the roll during the past two
days," said Secretary Faust Mascherini
yesterday, "and we have had many offers
of aid from farmers, mechanics and the
public at large."
The following letter is a sample of the
way the movement strikes the people of
the State:
Los Angeles, Feb. 12.
To Mascherini and Jones, Cuban Leagueâ
tlemen; I nave been greatly interested in
The Call's accounts of your meetings and
plans, first called to my attention by an edi
torial in the Herald here, commending Thk
Call and your league.
You may write nic down as one in full sym
pathy with the movement in every way. I
stand ready to give reasonable financial aiu
and to do everything in my power, within the
limits of the law. We often bear flippant,
light-headed people speak disparagingly of
Cuba's cause and call the Cubans half Indians
or savages; but it strikes me that a people
who have already begun to sow the seeds of
liberty are a lorg distance from barbarism,
and their appeal ought to be heard and re
sponded to by the masses in this country. Re
spectfully, - John W. Wilson.
Major W. Fahey of the Cosmopolitan
Hotel called yesterday and agreed to serve
the committee in any lawful way. Speak
ing of the struggle of the Cubans he said:
"Certainly it seems to me every Irish
patriot must sympathize with Cuba in her
great battle for freedom. No matter how
bumble or ignorant the Cubans may be,
they know enough to despise slavery and
crave for liberty, and they ought to be en
couraged."
When the local league is fully organ
ized along the lines of the New York or
der it will act in conjunction with the
National League, and it is proposed to
have something like a concerted move
ment in whatever is done throughout the
Nation.
The Grand Army of the Republic at
Oakland. has taken action and passed reso
lutions of sympathy with Cuba, and runny
members 01 the City posts have expressed
themselves in the same way. It ii hoped
that the Pioneers and other societies will
: take similar action.
TREBELLI'S VOICE AGAIN.
Oace More Its Beauty Charmed
Over a Thousand
Hearers.
The Gifted Soprano Gave a Splendid
Rendering of thi Palacca
From "Mignoa."
The programme presented at the Cali
fornia Theater last night was in every re
spect admirably selected, and appealed
both to the cultivated ear of the trained
musician and to the general public ignor
ant of technical terms.
Mile. Trebelli's popularity and claim to
distinction as a soprano vocalist of the
foremost rank were more than confirmed
in the estimation of her hearers, and if
any doubt lingered in the miuds of the
latter during tiie earlier part of ttie even
ing her exquisitely finished renderine of
the difficult palacca from Thomas' "Mig
non" must have dispelled it.
The bigbly romantic aria, "Caro Nome,"
from Verdi's 'Rigoletto," though partic
ularly distinctive in character, is aimost
as florid and difficult as tne palacca, and
was equally well Ming by the diva. In
strone contrast to the foregoing; were her
encore numbers and Particularly so
Bishop's "Love Has Eye?," Grteg'a
"Spring Song" and the ever popular
"Home, Sweet Home," all of which sne
pang to her own accompaniment. The au
dience sustained one disappointment in
her substitution of Bishop's "Bid Me Dis

de l'lnfante" from "Le Cid," announced
on the programme. : !.
Her other selections Jast nijrht were a
dainty Swedish polska sons by Danstrom;
Victor Masses chanson, "Petite Abeille,"
from "La Reinc Topaze," a charming
melody, ana a Scotch gong which needs
no introduction, "I'm Ower Young to
Marry Yet," which was sung with attrac
tive vivacity, although the national ac
cent was a trifle beyond her.
Loui Crepaux, the basso, and Arthur
Weiss, the 'ceilist of Messrs. Vert &
Haurwitz's trio of artists, helped to divide
the honors of the evening. Herr Weiss
really played magnificently, anil in Pop
per's delightful gavotte in D, a spinning
song and a Spanish dance by the same
composer, he perfectly exemplified his re
markable command of technique and ex
pression. Chopin's melancholy second
nocturne, Lindner's "Tarantelle" and
Thome's "Simple Aveu," all three re
ceived the same degree of finished inter
pretation at his hands.
M. Crepaux was. perhaps, heard to
the greatest advantage in Hess* melodic,
"Nous Vous Verrons,'' Grieg's "Plus
b'.anche est mon amour," Victor Harris'
"Madrigal," and an ana from Saint-Saens*
"Henry VIII." The first-named pos
sesses a typically original motif, whoso
tender and melancholy sugeestiveness
â was most pleasingly interpreted by the
singer. The "Evocation of the Nuns,"
from "Robert le Diable," loses much of
its distinction wiien deprived of scenic
accessories, and was for that reason
hardly so successful as the balance of the
basso's selections.

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
I Trade Journals From All
Quarters Report Increas
ing Business.
Land of Any Real Merit Touched
the Bottom Notch Dur
ing 1896.
An Expert's Opinion on the Condition
cf th? Market ard the Pros*
pects for the Future.
Among the real estate dealers there is a
growing conviction that their business is tend
ing upward and the market has assumed a
more satisfactory tone.
The noticeable improvement in the business
outlook which lollowed the election has con
tinued, though it cannot De said that 'the
prospects of a general rise of prices is very
brilliant. In other words, while the gloom
and uncertainty which hung over American
industry and commerce, as a result of the tariff
agitation and threats of the Democratic party,
while the paralysis resulting from uncertainty
in this regard has been largely relieved by the
defeat of the Administration and its policy,
still it must not be forgotten that the univer
sal depression which rests upon the whole in
dustrial and commercial world cannot be en
tirely removed as to this country by any local
political event.
Nor did the Republican leaders or press
promise during the campaign that a Repub
lican victory would immediately restore prices
and values, without which it cannot be ex
pected that production and trade will assume
a rapid upward tendency. What the Repub
licans did promise was that a repudiation of
the Democratic party and its free-trade policy
would dissipate the gloom and uncertainty in
that regard and to that extent effect a revival.
That result has been achieved by the Repub
lican victory.
In a- recent; interview with Thos Mapee, the
well-known real estate agent, who is consid
ered an authority on all matters pertaining to
landed interests he spoke rather cheeringly
of the prospects for better times. "I think,"
said he, "that all real estate having any real
merit touched bottom in 189t>. This -City,"
he continued, "is entering upon a new era,
and the Pan Joaquln Valley Rond will be a
very decided factor in this change. San Fran
cisco can. before long, compete with the East
when railroad rates will have been reduced in
other parts of the State as they have been
through portions of the San. Joaquln' Valley
since the Inauguration of the Valley Road.
"The old rule of all hat the traffic will bear
has been permanently broken, and the old
monopoly and the new road alike will aid all
sorts of development in the great valley by
charging reasonable freight rates. The next
most important aid to City and State growth
and progress is the growth of beets and sugar
beet manufactories.
"The revival of gold mining on a legitimate
basis 1* another strong factor in favor of prog
ress. And last, but by no means least, in the
line of advance, is the subdivision of large
acreage into small tracts. When- the next
exodus of farmers comes here from the East,
they will be accommodated with farming
lands at farming prices.
"The outlook for better prices for wheat,
fruit and wine is good, but perhaps the most
cheering fact of all is that the water injected
into the prices of farming lands by booms and
boomers has been nearly all squeezed out.
Hard times, low prices tor land products and
many foreclosures of mortgages did this. All
of these things were recorded as misfortune*,
and they were misfortuntts, too, but mis
fortunes not without some compensation.
"The real estate outlook is that the prices of
all lots in the dwelling regions that are within
convenient reach of c ble or electric cars will
not fall further. The tendency will be up
ward, although we look for little advance In
prices of any Kind of dwelling property, of
either the first, second or third class this year.
Prices of the two latter kind's of property "have
fallen since May, 1891, 25 to 40 per cent.
Many new houses, costing $1500 to $5000
each, have within that time been erected in
the districts â There these reductions occurred,
and several fast electric-car lints have been
built out to them. These aids to progress and
increase of improvements, of course, tend to
advance prices, and they would have so ad
vanced last year, but the pernicious effects of
the inflation of 1839 and 1891 have not yet
been wholly erased, and no immediate ad
vance of prices can therefore yet be looked for
â¢Business properties of a yki d, present or.
prospective, paving anything like a fair net
I income, Trill hold their own this year. The
best business properties on Market street cer-
t ainly will, and the next bÂ»st. near to Market
street, whether wholesale or retail, but espe
cially the latter, will not all be likely to show
weaker prices."
The most important transfer in realty re
ported during the past week has been the sale
of the property at the north corner of Second
and Mission streets to Wells, Fargo & Co. for
the sum of 5125.000. as it is reported. The
lot has a frontage of 157 feet on Second by 112
feet ou Mission and New Anthony.
W. H. Meeks, Gnstav C. L&ndis and George
A. Low are the sellers.

OITY HALL MARBLE WORK.
Union Workmen Declare it Is Not Up
to Specifications.
The Marble Cutters and Finishers' As
sociation objects seriously to the charac
ter of work and to the workmanship De
ing performed upon the new interior mar
ble walls in the City .Hall tower. Ii is
claimed by the men of the Union that tbe
marble is not being polished and tbe con
struction is not according to plans and
spe cincations tiled in the City Architect's
office; in other words that the taxpayers
are not petting their moneys worth, and
the local skilled marble-workers are made
subservient to workmen little used to the
particular work they are doing.
A meeting of the association was held
yesterday afternoon at 1019 Market street,
and the committee that had waited on the
City Hall Commissioners last Saturday re
ported that it had been authorized to ap
point a good workman to polish a large
sample of marble in the proper way no
that it might be compared with the work
beitiÃ done in the City Hall. ;
The sense of the meeting was that each i
individual member of the union should do
his utmost to push the investigation to a
final issue. Speeches on the subject were
made by President Henken of the Build
ing Trades Council, and by Mr. Hughes of
the Metal Roofers' Union.
James Sullivan, John T. McCann and
John J. McCann were appointea delegates
to the Building Trades Council.
Another meeting of the marble-workers
will be held next Sunday at 1019 Market
street. . â¢ v>^

durint the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect po!n s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted linen, equal temperature. The
word "hleh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
rtfers to low presMure. and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloud v weather and rains.
"hows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure Is high In the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low- is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "hlsrh" In the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce anVpposite result.

FOR CHARITY
Only Two Years of Fancy
Salaries for the County
Officers.
Why the Municipal League
Should Have Indorsed the
Park Project.
Except to the Regular Politician the
Municipal Campaign Is Very
Dull.
Oakt.anb Office Pax Francisco Calx,,*
908 Broadway, Feb. 14. j
The cutting, down of the salaries of
county officials cannot help but have a
good effect. For several year* legislators
have been pledged to economy and have
thrown their pledges to the wind. A dele
gation four years ago pledged to economy
actually added to the cost of this county.
While the work in the several offices is
much about the same, and involves about
trre same amount of responsibility, the
salaries under the plan cf appropriating a
Jump sum for each department has been
bo varied that while one man cleared
Â£ j2600 a year, another would clear not less
1 ;ian $10,000.
The argument is now made that the
saiaries allowed are such as would be paid
under the same conditions in the com
mercial world, and tnis is what they
â¢ .-nould be. There is, however, one thing
4o be considered, tnat so long as the fancy
. salaiies are no longer the legitimate prey
of office-holders they must not be ci
â¢ pected to nave an open purse from which
all manner of political and jihilanthroDic
ringers can be tilled at random.
Under the new regime this much con
sideration must be shown. But it is as
'well to bear in mind that the new sched
ule does not affect the present incumbent,
so the retrenchment will have no excuse
to commence until the next board of
county officers assume their duties in 1899.
The Merchants' Exchange is consider
ing a plan to advertise Oakland to the
world. All kinds of schemes have been
placed befora them, but the desired end
has not been gained, and the complaint is
still made that in the different parts of
.the country it is difficult to learn any
thing of Alameda County.
At this time when the matter of public
parks is leing agitated the desire of the
Merchants' Exchange to let outside States
know of Oakland is very timely. Tnou
sanos of people have heard of the beauty
of Golden Gate Park who know nothing
in detail of the City of San Francisco, and
should Oakland acquire an immense pub
lomain and show some liberality in
adorning it it would do far more to' ad
vertise this city than will be done in many
years by sending out pamphlets contain
ing matter of varied degrees of excellence.
It is to be regretted that the Municipal
League in the platform which it framed
at its convention two woeks ago should
â brave thrown cold water on the scheme to
acquire parks. Nothing can be accom
plished in any city wnen the leading
mercantile bodies are opposed by a reform
political movement o/ which better things
. might reasonably be expected. The league
. platform, while it did not so state, con-
L veyud more than a hint that the scheme
f to provide a public park might develop
into a job by which some one might bene
fit. It is absolutely certain that a large
. acreage of property will not be "found"
anywhere and cannot be acquired except
by purchase, and as it is equaliy certain
tnat the matter will have to be submitted
to the people at a special election before
bonds can be issued for the purchase it
can reasonably be inferred that any 'job"
would be unearthed long before it was un
.loaded on the people.
A park of fifty acres that could be
reached by the many electric roads now
â¢ running out to the foothills would do
more to advertise Oakland and attract
people to this city ti.an the sending out of
any'amountof statistical literature.
The average citizen of Oakland is now
- thoroughly surfeited with politics, and
never was a municipal campaign launched
in a quieter manner than tbe one now
suDposed to be waging.
"What with primaries, conventions and
â¢ elections, the city has been disturbed
since last August, and the commercial
element views with immense satisfaciion
the fact that after March 8 there will be at
least a year and a half before politics
again- disturb normal conditions.
At the preient lime, outside of the same
old company with whom politics means
bread and butter, the interest in the local
â  campaign is very smali. The great ma
jority of voters have already decided upon
their choice, and it is a matter of some
difficulty to get a reasonable attendance
at campaign meetings. As a matter of
fact, politics has become somewhat of a
farce on local lines. Each element is di
vided, and even the solid Republican front
shown last November does not exist la the
present conflict.
The whole Republican ticket is certainly
worthy of support, and if the Republicans
themselves desire it they could, of course,
elect it from top to bottom. Judging by
the present outlook, however, there will
be some serious breaks, and unless great
discretion is exercised by tbe body politic
/ ; ere will be a repetition during the next
J^ ~> years of the municipal farce that has
TTÂ£;;raced the City Hail during the term
. now so r.ear its close.
Auditor Snow has issued a report which
is sorhewhat remarkable inasmuch an
there is no item in any of the departments
charged to 'â¢sundries." Jn this connec
tion he made the following explanation a
lew days ago: "When I rim took office,"
said the Auditor, "I had considerable dif
fjculty in knowing just what people spent.
The report- from the different depart
ments would come to me and the largest
item would be sundries. I gave the boys
a hint and told them that I would not
audit any more accounts for sundries, and,
although there may have been a diminu
tion in the number of cigars smoked
around the ball and in the strength of the
' jer.umoon official handkerchiefs, there
lias also beer, a diminution of the expense
of the various departments; and after an
f.xperiencp of eight years I feel that I can
truthfully say that this city is supplied by
contractors on as honest and economical
a basis as any city in the Union."

OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 14.â Robert
Smilie of Oakland, who was referred to in
an article published in Thz Cam. of yes
terday, has prepared the following state
ment for publication:
t Editor Morning Call, San Francisco: For the
â  m rpoi>e of giving a lair statement of condl
â W His a* they exist in t:ie right-of-way affairs
<&t â  the San Francisco and San Joftquin Valley
. tllroad, i W i Ã h to give a brief outline of our
position in this matter.
I consider myself unjustly attacked by the
writer of me article on the above subject in
your columns of to-day. Allow me to state
our position in thin matter from the beginning.
Our company is the owner of 580 acres of
land, with improvements which have cost us,
â¢with interest, upward of $200,000. The right
of way runs diagonally across our land a little
v#-Â«t of center of section. We nave been to

considerable expense Irvine to get a change of
survey which would move the road about 700
feet west of present survey. By making this
change'the road would run across on* quarter
of section and leave two quarters almost in
tact.
1 â¢as given to understand by authority of
the comj any's chief engineer and managing
directors at all times since our first interview,
which was last August, that if the right of
way would not cost more on the quarter angles
thai they would make ti.e ci.anpe. I have
canvassed the distance and have demonstrated
thnt'the change of line would make a consid
erables aviug In the liurcliat- of right of way
over land not ownei by our company, and
agreed for my company to give a half interest
in eighty ncres, to be used for toivn-slie pur
poses, and a free right of way across our place,
â which would be over a mile in length. .
1 have been given to understand in the last
few days that they will not consent to the
moving of survey as intended, but propose to
run on the line which causes us much damage,
and further want a right of way 100 feet wide,
with the privilege of removing trees andvines
and of making burrow pits to procure earth to
grade high enough to clear irrigating ditches
; which are above the general level of the land.
We proposed to them either to syphon the
ditches or briug in earth to build up their
proposed grade. This requirement we cannot
consider a $7000 Improvement to our place, i
On the other hand, making burrow pits
.would cause much more than that amount In
damage to our property, and would leave a
perpetual nuisance in the form of weeds and
stagnant water. We have not given a price as
much as we consider the damage on the pres
ent proposed line, and hare directed our en
ergies to trying to make the damage less to our
property and cheapen the right or way for the
railrond company. As this property Is situ
ated between two lines, with a station four
miles and another six miles to the west, and
our products are all for Eastern shipment, wo
cannot consider ourselves benefited as much
as many that have properly a greater distance
from stations. Your re:erenie to the feeling of
Fresnoltes J cannot give connderr.tion. as it is
well known ihat they have uot paid for what
they have received from us. As evidence of
this 1 hold an unpaid judgment against that
county of over $3000. Yours respectfully,
Robert Smilik.

Divided.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,]
903 Broadway, Feb. 14. j
Some well-known sporting men have ar
ranged for a prizefight at PJeasanton, and
the auiet little town does not intend to
allow it if it can be helped. The Trustees
are not unanimous on the advisability ot
stopping the tight, which has been the ab
sorbine topic of conversation in the town
for two weeks. A special meeting cf the
Trustees failed to accomplish anything.
A petition against prize-fightinc; being
allowed in the town has been drawn up
by Rev. Mr. Wilson of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, Charles White, Philip
Kolb, C. H. Wise, George Detjens and J.
N. Arendt, and It has numerous signa
tures.
Trustee Martin does not think any
action should be taken. He says there is
no town law governing prize-fights and he
can see "no harm in a colored ruau and a
white man battering each other for the
amusement of a crowd.that likes that kind
of sport." I
Mr. Gray, another Tiustee, takes a dif
ferent view of tho matter, and Trustee
Hortenstine would like to stop prize
righting, but cannot quite see the way.
The matter will be decided at the next
meetinp of the Trustees.
The affair that is creating such a dis
turbance is the Turner-Nichol contest be
fore the Antelope Athletic Club next
Wednesday.

ligion as Taught in
Oakland Churches.
Salvationists and Seventh-Day
Adventists Ccme Within â¢
Its Scope.
Ha Declares That the Union Revival j
Acts Most on Weak
Intellects
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,) ,
908 Broadway, Feb. 14. )
. Dr. C. W. Wendte's announcement that
he would handle fearlessly the doctrine
of fear and hell as taught in the Oakland
churches was fully justified this morning.
The Unitarian divine delivered an address
that will rank as one of the most remark
able ever heard from a local pulpit.
With only a few personal references, Dr.
Wendte forcibly attacked the revival now
in progress in this city, defended Pro
fessor Jordan, answered Dr. Munhall's re
cent references to Voltaire, and made a
casual allusion to other creeds, including
the Seventh-day Adventists and Salva
tion Army.
Dr. Wendte opened his address with a
description of the two distinct portraits of
Christ found in the New Testament â one
the avenging Christ of Revelations, the
other the loving Christ of the gospels â
and be declared that any attempt to
reconcile the two must of necessity be
futile and farcical. After defining the
two great schools of Christian thought as
those of fear and of love, he said:
It is a curious and suggestive fact that two
Sundays ago a dramatic version of the parable
of tne Foolish Virgins was rendered in Hie
chancel of a Protestant church in San Frau
ciico. I'oung girls from the congregation,
suitably arrayed, fmpertonated the unhappy
victims and rent the air with the'.r anguish at
finding the door shut against them. This was
one of the favorite miracle plays of the middle
ages.
In the local case the devil and his imps were
indeed wanting, but were probably supplied
in the sermon of the minister, who improved
the opportunity, the gas being turned down,
to impress upon his hearers the awful nature
of divine judgment and the terrible danger to
which their obduracy exposed them.
It is the simple truth to My that to-day, as
in former times, fear is the sentiment most
appealed to in the prevailing churches.
The revival now in progress iv Oakland Is a
striking confirmation o: the statement. To
show the necessity of salvation Dr. Munhall,
the revivalist, pictures hell In the most cross
and materialistic fashion, as a literal Jake of
fire and brimstone, and seeks to terrify his
hearers into an acceptance of the terms of
grace. Verily, he has his reward. Youug
people, whose imagination is more keenly de
veloped than their reason, and all who feel,
but do nut think, are agitated and alarmed.
Even if not fully convinced they respond to
his sophistical pleading to be on the safe side,
or are carried away by the excitement sur
rounding them. lean imagine a revival based
on charity toward our neighbor and an eternal
hoi for all, but a revival based on mac's cow
urdly fears and selfish hopes I have little re
spect for. I admit that It corresponds to some
elements In human nature, especially in its
', earlier stages of moral and spiritual develop
ment. The feebler in intellect, the weaker in
will a man is, thb more powerful will be the
dominion of fear over his Imagination and
conscience. A higher development of his
mental and moral powers is required, ere he
can rise superior to the tremors of his flesh, the
morbid fancies of his imagination, and breathe
the purer atmosphere of faith, hope and love.
Unquestionably, the notion of Jesus as an
angry and implacable judge of the world is I
foreign to the real spirit of the gospel. It is i
to be found chiefly in the book of Revelations, j
which, in Lie opinion of leading critics of the j
new and rising school of biblical science, is '
either a Jewish apocalyptical writing, re
vamped and directed against Nero and other '
persecutors of the early Christian?, or else Is I
a palpable imitation. of later Jewish scripture !
like the books of Daniel. Krdras and others.
Yet this religion of fear is preached daily in I
our midst. The Salvation Army makes It its
main reliance in its religious work, or would,
but for the great human loving heart in its
rank and tile. This overcomes even its harsh
doctrine and symbols of war and bloodshed,
symbols which, in themselves, are so foreign
to a true Christianity.
The Seventh Day Adventists are a most ex
cellent people, but their doctrine of Christ
and the last judgment Is not based on the
gospel of Jesus, but on a Jewish-Christian per
version of his character and teachings.
The prevailing spirit in Oakland churches
should be joy and not fear, hope and not de
spair. No man was ever truly converted by
iear. Hell is a fiction of theologians, an in
vention of - priests, a "scare-head" of revival
ists. Let this "rawhead and bloody bones" of
theology, as Historian Aleor calls it, be rele
gated to deserved and odious oblivion.
DEVILS SURPASS MAN.
Professor Bacon on the The
ology of Evil
Spirits.
Ha Says There Is No Virtue in a
Belief in th? Unity of
God
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 14.â Professor
Thomas R. Bacon of the State University
preached to the Unitarians in Stiles' HalJ
this morning on the text, "Thou believeth
that there is one God; thou doest well;
the devil also believes and trembles. But
wi It thou know, O vain man, that faith
without works is dead !"'
"Devils seem to be great theologians at
times," said Professor Bacon. "At the
perioa when James wrote the wonis of the
text the belief in the unity of God was a
rare one, but it appears that the dcv.l had
grajped it, not merely one or a few of
them, but all. We do not really know
a grt-at deal about the devils. Only in the
Bible do we learn that they exist and then
our information is vague.
"All is inference and conjecture beyond
the simple fact that they exist â that
somewhere in the moral universe are dis
eniimdied spirits given over to evil.
"Unhampered by ihe obscurations of the
flesh such beings would naturally be ac
quainted with spiritual truthÂ». They
Know that God is one as a fact and as eas
ily as we see and know thai graÂ«-s is green.
Doubtless the theology of the devil is
tar more accurate than that of any men.
"Qur knowledge that God is one is little
to our credit. Our fathers found it out
long ago and handed it down to us as the
multiplication table or the fact of the
rotundity of the earth."
Professor Bacon announced that the
pulpit would be occupied next Sunday by
Professor Griggs of Stanford and that Dr.
Altrer, the new pastor of the church, is
expected to arrive during the following
week.
Kan Over and Killed.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 14.â A man
known as "Indian Thomas" was killed by
ttie Livermore Jocal train at Pleasanton
this evening. Thomas was one of the best
known characters in that neighborhood,
and had lived there for many years. It is
not known bow be came to be on tbe
I track. The case was reported to Coroner
Baldwin, who will hold an inquest to
morrow afterncon.
SCORE SENATOR BEARD.
{ He Kills the Annexation Scheme of the
Knclnal City Fathers in the
Senate.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 14.â The citizens
! of this place are wrathy over the action of
\ Senator Beard of Warm Springs, and they
believe that he gives them good cause
I to be.
On the north side of the city, situated
along the southern shore of the tidal
canal, is a strip of land thirty feet in
j width, known as Harrison street. It i
I not down on the original city grant, be
longs to no one seemingly, and if any on
has jurisdiction over it it is the Board o
I Supervisors.
The city applied to the Legislature fo
|an enabling act to annex it. There being
j no inhabitants on it an election could not
I be held.
Assemblyman Waymire introduced the
bill in the House and requested Senator
, Beard to do likewise in the Senate. He
[expressed his willingness, and up to the
j first of last week it was supposed that he
j had. But one of the city oilicials", on look
ing the matter up, found that the biil was
not there. Bear lis said to have declar
, that the City Trustees could go where it
' never freezes.
The only hope the bill now has of pass-
Ime is in the shape of sn emergency
! measure, and as it is not probable that
any such action will be taken Harrison
j street must remain out in the cold another
j two years.

NEW SHOOTING GROUNDS
A Very Picturesque Spot Se
lected by the Olympic
Gun Club.
A Trial Shoot-Getting Ready for a
Tournamentâ Electricity Ap
plied to Traps.
Preliminary to a two-day open-to-ail
bluerocfc and live-bird tournament to bo
given, beginning next Sunday, by the
Olympic Gun Club, a number of members
braved the rain and went out to Ingleaide
yesterday to have a first shoot and trial on
the club's new grounds.
Picturesque is exactly the word tbat de
scribes the new grounds. They are the first
for live-bird shooting in San Francisco,
and are naturally as fine as can be found
in this country. Both the bluerock and
live-bird sections command a view ol Lake
Merced and the Pacific Ocean. Two bulk
heads, score boxes, platforms and traps
are in, and a shed has been erected for the
shelter and convenience of marksmen.
"The tangle shot pull," an electric con
trivance for the release of traps, was tried
the first time yesterday at the grounds.
This is the invention of Thomas R. Bar
ney of the Olympic Club and it the first
practical application of electricity to live
bird traps in the United States. Trie
shooter has no knowledge of which one of
five or any number of traps Is going to be
released, and it further prevents possibil
ity of collusion. A nian stands behind
the shooters, and by levers on a sort of a
dial arrangement releases the traps. It
worked yesterday to perfection. In the
forenoon there was a little live-bird shoot
ing, but no attempt at scores was made.
In tne afternoon the following scores at
bluerocks were made:
Otto Feidiier 12, A. Blank 6, Kaurman 11,

In subs. Â«nee the bil.'s pÂ«s;ed or in a fa. way
to be phss d are these relating to minimum
oomoeiatti n. citizens' belp, ight-hour day
audL-brDiv. The amendments to the civ-
Â»hip aid eight-hour bills practically de
stroy their effect.
bo far as the crmml'tee had been able to
Wrn everything ;Â»..^ible has been dons to
further the lnbor bills, rurther work by the
committee wouid be unnecessary. Great difii
culiywas f Una in geitine thi- committees ot
both house.s to meet, ami when they d:d there
were usually so few members present that no
definite action could Le taken toward report
inn the bills.
Teg ea est difficu'ty wa> experienced with
the b li ior the estab.isnment of a department
of labor on account of the political compo
sition of the LegMn'ure and the option of
the employment agents. Great di UDt was ex
p essed as to passage of the m nsr.re.
The committee, in < onelu->Â». n, recommended
that the work of the Lubor convention be con
tinued dn ing the present se>ision of the Legis
lature for the benefit of labor.
H. A. Knox, a delegate from the rail
road employes, placed before the conven
tion some facts and figures calculated to
prove that legislation for the reduction of
streetcar fares to 2% cents during the
early morning and evening hours would
practically amount to confiscation of the
property of the railroads, because they
could not under such conditions pay ex
penses. He read a statement of .he case
made by the Ban Francisco and San Ma
teo Railroad Company, which was practi
cally an assertion that should the bill pass
the Legislature the company would have
to stop business and the employes would
be out of work. Similar statements with
additional arguments were made by ex-
Mayor Butro, in which he explained that
the Sutter-street Railroad Company and
the Sutro Railroad Company by a system
of transfers actually get but 2% cents on
a fare, and would under the proposed re
daction get but \yÂ± cents a fare.
The Union-street Railway Company was
aJso quoted as one of the roads that would
be forced to shutdown. ' â¢
In conclusion, Mr. Knox declared that
these four companies would be materially
injured to t; c extent probably of furnish
ing no further employment to all the men
now earning a livelihood from them as
operatives, while the complicated South
ern Pacific rail road system would
not necessarily suffer, for it could stop
transfers, charge extra for small parcels
carried by patrons, and could buy up the
smaller roads forced out of business, and
might ultimately profit from the bill
which it alone of all the companies is not
opposing. He said finally that be pur
posed to go to Sacramento this morning
to work personally agiinst the bill.

DEAR SIR: ~"~~
Yes. it's a fact (because of Inevitable private
reason-;). I'm compelled to offer my lund agency
business for sr le, and in order to effect a quic<
deal am wliling to make a great sacrifice and give
some one a great b irgaln and finest business oa
Pacific Coast for almost nothing. You may think
it strange (and so it is) that after 16 years of valu-
able experience In the business, having spent
thousands of dollars In advertising and traveled
the Stare over with horse and ou.-gy inspecting
and appraising nearly every rancn on the Pacific
Coast, and now having secured the agency of
about 3000 choice properties offered for sale and
exchange, earned $30,000 commissions In last five
years, still I've rea ly decided to sell everything
Just as it stands, Including my enormous list of ac"
curate. y written descriptions, together with all con-
tracts, complete set of blanks, specially designed!
and primed set of booKs, diagrams, maps, nun- VI
dreds of photographs, thousands of letters, Hat of If
prospective, purchasers, all furniture, etc., V
in fact, the most complete and best system-
ATIZKD LAND AGENCY IS AMERICA, Occupying
three elegantly furnished f.oul rooms, secured by
long lease at reasonable rent. Everything is In
p rrect condition ajid though having cost thou-
sands of dollars and years of hard work all goes
lor a few hundred dollars^ which should easily ba
made back from deals now in progress within one
month. In conclusion I will say that as the busi-
ness is simple to conduct and prospects were never
belter any wideawake business man can take my
place and make much more in the future thau I
have in the past. Pleasant, profitable and genteel,
with unlimited possibilities. Thorough investiga-
tion invited by yours truly,

RAISED TWENTY
THOUSAND DOLLARS
The Congregation of St.
Luke's Subscribes
Liberally.
The New Church No Longer a
Dream, but a B'issful
Reality.
The New Structure to Cost $50,000
It Will Be Erected on the Present
Site, Van Ness and Clay.
It took but a few words and a few min
utes at St. Luke's Church yesterday morn
ing to raise $20,000 toward the erection of
a new building for the congregation.
At the meeting, which was held just
after the morning services, Senior Warden
A. N. Drown took the floor and explained
the reason for the necessity of a new build
ing. Ha said the object of the meeting
was to discover the feeling of the congre
gation toward the plan proposed.
"The church,'' said he, "is but poorly
ventilated, there is Dot room enough and
I'm sure there is not a person who enters
the building who does not feel apologetic.
Other parishes have put up elegant new
buildings, and are we less abie to build a
new cburcti than these other parishes? It
is not to be understood mat all the money
must be paid at once. Take a year or two
years, or even longer if you like.
"Now, without saying any more, there
are just two questions to be asked: Do I
want a new church? and. How much do I
want it? Now all tho^e in favor of the
new church so sisnifv by rising."
The whole congregation rose as one,
and the new ctiuicti was decided upon.
Henry Scott then rose and said that, al
though he was not a member of the Epis
copal church, lie loved St. Luke's, and
was willing to lend ail the assistance he
possibly could. "This church Is thirty
years old, and thai is about the life ot a
wooden building," said he, "'and I'll sta-t
the ball a-rolling and subscribe $2000 for
myself and $1000 for my wifn. ''
Mr. Drown subscribed $3000 and his
wife $2000, and in less than half an hour
over $20.0u0 was raised.
A committee of rive was appointed to
co-operate with the vestrymen. The
members are Captain Simpson, A. H.
Phelps, J. P. Lanehorne, Ralph Daniels
and A. B. Ford. They will meet Tuesday
evening and discuss other plans lor rais
ing mo'e money.
The present church was built thirty
years a;o on Pacific avenue as a mission
ary church; thirteen years ago it was
moved to i:s present site. Ii is a low
wooden building, and looks rather out of
place among the beautiful residences
springing up all around it. Several plans
for the new cnurch have been submitted
by different architects, but none have
been accepted.

IS HOME FROM
HER TRAVELS
Miss Margaret Craven
Brings Stories of a
Pleasant Journey.
She Liked Egyptians and Also
the Belligerent Sou*
danese.
Times Are Hard in Italy Because So
Few Americans Are Go ng
Abroad.
Mri. Nettie Craven was one of the hap
piest women in San Francisco last night
because of the arrival of her daughter,
Miss Marearet, from a three months' tour
through Italy ana Egypt.
Miss Craven had a delightful tour, but
was pleased to return to her home once
more. She made a careful study of noted
places while away, and particularly of the
races of men she met.
"I found every body in Italy complain
ing of hard times," she said, "and the rea
son given was queer, being a sort of re
flex action from America. Tbe Italian
beggars would say to one, 'Times are hard
here because Americans are not travel
ing.' The old rule enunciated by Mark
Twain in 'Innocents Abroad' still held
true. Everywhere the price of an article
is one llliltji for an American and another
for the remainder of mankind. It seems
to me the Italians are in a bad way finan
cially, and tne lower classes are dishonest
aud vindictive as well."
Mi-.- Craven was particularly delighted
with her voyage up the Niie, where she
was fortunate in meeting many travelers
whose advice was of considerable value.
"I went trom Cairo up the Nile as far as
the first cataract," she said, "and on the
voyage l saw a number of English soldiers
from Khartoum. Our party took great
care to study the tombs and ruins, noting
as wÂ« went the multitudes of camels and
donkeys. We tislied in tbe Nile and
caught catti-hes in large numbers. On
Christmas day we decorated our boats
with palms."
The young lady tourist was much pleased
in studying the various races she en
countered, particularly the Soudanese,
Bedouins aod Ethiopians.
"The Soudanese are black little bow
legged chaps," she said, "particularly
noted for their righting qualities. They
are as savage as bu.ldogs and the sight of
Llood in battle makes them uncontrol
lable. They call themselves black English
men, and it was too funny to see each
black soldier with red fez and white linen
uniform marching to the tune 'Her Golden
Hair Was Hanging Down Her Back,' Dut
few saw the humor of it."
Miss Craven thinks tbe Egyptians a
superior race. "The men are tall and
line looking," she said, "and the women
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1897.
are graceful little creatures, all heavily
veiledâ and their feet are small. A strange
fact is that the eyes of many of them are
bad because they are neglected when
small and the flies abounding in Egypt
are allowed to molest them. I met a
donkey-boy wno got me to do him a great
service. He was about to marry and he
was anxious to know what kind of a
looking girl his wife was, the cus
tom being that he could not see her.
He was taKing her on the word of
her grandmother and hi* own parents.
'But you go and look for me,' he said,
'for when she lifts her veil ?he may have
bad eyes or be ugly. It will cost me Â£15
to marry and I do not want to be de
ceived.'
"Well, I went and looked for him,"
said Miss Craven, "and I beheld the
sweetest kind of a little KgyD'ian girl, so
I said: 'I don't know just how much
girls are worth, but if you can get her lor
Â£15 i 's a bargan,' and I believe they were
married. He took my word."

THE CHAMPION
AT THE CHUTES
James J. Corbatt Is Cheered
by Thousands of
Admirers.
His Perfect Condit : on Is Dis
payed in a Bout With
Jack McVey.
The Men Who Will Box on Wash
ington's Birthday Are Now in
Training.
James J. Corbett, apparertly a perfect
specimen of physical manhood, intro
duced himself yesterday afternoon and
night to many thousands of people who
crowded at the Chutes to greet him.
It was not the "Pompadour" Jim that
they saw some months ago in an unsatis
factory fistic encounter with Tom Shar
key, but a tine, active, powerful and weJl
traincd athlete.
These two Corbetts are so different that
it aimost passes comprehension that they
can be the same man.
When Jim was here before and he gave
Snarkey an opportunity to make a Dame
in the pugilistic world which name Dan
Stuart, the great fight promoter, values at
$5000. he held the sailor lad too cheaply.
! He did not train in the least for the en
gagement, or if he did, as be said him
self, it was on French dinners.
An hour before the contest Jim ate a
dish of shrimp salad, and Sbarkey's terri
fic onslaught caused the champion to re
gret he had indulged in tha delicacy at
such an undue hour.
However, that was Corbett of the past,
and the Corbett of the present is the
other.
He is in great fettle, such as a thorough
bred might be on the eve of a big race.
The people who crowded about him yes
terday realized this and by their cheers
â  and plaudits evinced the delight they felt
j at the observance.
It was truly a day at the Chutes.
Before noon it was doubtful whether
Corbett would keep his engagement to
spur with jack McVey, his partner. The
log and drizzling rain maae everybody
uncomfortable, and the srounds were
soggy in the extreme. Under ordinary
circumstances, they would not have been
opened at all, but it was different this
time. A couple of thousand people, men,
boys and women, tramped through the
slu>h and clamored for admittance. They
were allowed inside the enclosure without
pay, for it was almost positive then that
the champion DUgilist would not put in an
appearance.
Later on the clouds rolled by and sun
shine brightened things up. Press Agent
Phil Hastings, who had been running the
town over for Corbett, found him and re
ceived his assurance that he would fulfill
his engagement. This glorious news was
telephoned to the grounds, whereupon the
3000 deadheads were herdpd and marched
outside to face the ticket-sellers.
By the time the sparring event of the
day was ripe there were 10,000 people on
the grounds, every soul of them crushing
and jamming to get near the platform in
the open air. It was a good-natured
crowd, withal, and hundreds stood bare
headed so as to give those behind them a
better view.
Of course where there is such a throng
of anxious humanity, pushing and shov
ing on the border of a late, some few un
fortunates fell in and were fished out wet
and forlorn. But this only added to the
enjoyment of theothers.
The usual programme of amusements
was cr.rried out and shortly before 5
o'clock Corbett and McVey put in an ap
pearance in ring costume, excepting that
they wore tights.
It was only an exhibition that they
gave, just such a passage at arms as the
two men have given scores of times.
There was no righting, nor were there any
hard blows. Corbett showed his wonder
ful ducking powers and his speedy leg
action. McVey did his rart well. He
made some awful swings, first telegraph
ing them to his partner, who always got
his head out of roach.
The public was pleased, however, with
tbree rounds of this kind and they were
liberal with their praise.
Corbett leaves this evening at 6 o'clock
for Reno, where he will give an exhibition
to-morrow night. He will be accompanied
by his brother Harry, Jack McVey and
Joe Corbett.
Billy Delaney, who is Corbett's chief
trainer, will not leave here until the night
of the 23d, when he will be accompanied
by big Jim Jeffries, the Los Angeles
heavyweight, who is to be the main
sparring partner of the cnampion.
There is not much betting on the com
ing contest and there is not likely to be
yet for a while, until the gladiators are
located at wort in their respective train
ing quarters. In the meantime, parties
are being formed to leave this City, Oak
land and San Jose a day or two before the
fight, in special cars, so as to arrive tbeie,
take the mill in and return home all
inside of four days.
FIGHTERS IN TRAINING.
The Men Who Will Box on the 22d
Are Rapidly Getting Into
Condition.
The fighters who are signed to box at
the California Club's entertainment at
Woodwaraa Pavilion on the evening of
Washington's birtnday are rounding into
shape and are beginning to wear the
drawn faces that teli of good condition.
At the Six-mile House on the San Bruno
road Jeffries, the genial and quiet Los
Angeles lad who is to go to Carson to aid
in training Corbett as soon as his engage
ment with Stelzner is settled, puts in
twelve to fifteen miles a day on the road
in addition to the gymnasium work, and
says that be is getting into better fix
everyday.
Under Patsy Corrigan's watchful eye he
has taken off twenty-six pounds in the
last five days, and will reduce still further
betorn the building-up process begins.
Soldier Walker and Jack Goff went out to
re-enforce Corrican yesterday and will be
with the Los Angeles fichter in the ring.
Billy Smith, the willing Australian
boxer, is also at the Six- Mile House, witu
Jack Hill as trainer, and looks fit to fight
to-night if necessary. Smith is a glutton
for work, and feels confident ot winning
whether the match ends in a knockout or
a decision.
Tbe two men and their trainers form a
jolly combination that beeps things going
at a lively pace in the usually quiei resort.
Spider Kelly, who is to tight ten rounds
with Lon Acnew. is working like a beaver
at the Ocean Beach, and thinks that he
will be in as good condition as he ever was
in his life when the appointed day arrives.
He has a grievance against Agnew that
hÂ« hopes to settle satisfactorily to himÂ«e!f.
When the pair were matched some time
a^o Kelly developed a tine collection of
"Job's comforters" tbat prevented him
from going on with the match, and Aenew
insinuated that Kelly's affliction was put
on to get out of the fight.
The Spider feels tbat he must have re
venge for this, and intends to take it out
of tiie Cnicago boy's biae.
Henry Peppers, who is matched with
Smith, is with Kelly and training more or
less. The colored man does not take
kindly to hard worlr, but has little super
fluous fiesh and gen-rally appears in "the
ring in lair condition.
Lon Agnew, always in eood condition,
is putting on the finishing toucbes and
improving his wind at tbe Acme Club,

COMMUNE'S ANNIVERSARY
It Will Be Specially Celebrated
by the Socialists of San
Francisco.
"Governmental Paternalism" Dis
cussed Last Night at the Regular
Weekly Meeting.
The new and larger hall now occupied
by the socialists at ,35 Eddy street was
packed at the regular Sunday night meet
ing. The speaker of the evening was G.
Benham and his topic was, "Government
Paternalism."
He criticized work in penitentiaries, say
ing: "If you commit a crime in this
country we will see that you are. given
work and are properly cared for. That is
the position of the States of North Caro
lina and South Carolina to-day."
By several illustrations the speaker
sought to show that the Government is
now to a limited extent paternal. Owner
ship of railroads, he said, had saved in
Germany 20 per cent of the lives of em
ployes, and he said that for no other rea
son the system is worth adopting in this
country. One hundred ana fifty pounds
of newspapers were carried across the con
tinent by railroads for 1 cent a pound, but
it cost a man who weighed the came or
less $75 to $100 to make the trip.
The reason, he said, that parcels by mail
are limited to four pounds in weight, was
that the monopolistic express companies
wanted to carry the heavy packages.
The topic was then thoroughly dis
cussed.
The Socialists are making arrangements
to celebrate the anniversary of the rising
of the Paris commune on March 14 next.
There will, in all probability, be no parade,
but Metropolitan Temple, or some other
large hall, will be rented and a literary,
musical and oratorical programme suit
able to the occasion will be rendered.

Lecture on Heaven.
Rev. J.S. David of the Swedenborg Mission
said in his sermon at Red Men's building yes
terday: "Heaven is not in sun, moon or star.
It is said to be on high, but height in scripture
does not refer to space, in which there is really
no up or dowa. U is symbolic language re
ferring to the soul. The only real ud ana
down is elevation and degradation in moral,
intellectual and spiritual .ife. Heaven is not
a location, but a state of the inneripan, a state
of love for God and love for man, a state of
illumination and wisdom, s state of unselfish
love of use. He who has attained to a heav
enly state in this life is already in heaven,
and when he lays off the garment of flesh he
will come into a wo rid that harmonizes with
nis inner life."
