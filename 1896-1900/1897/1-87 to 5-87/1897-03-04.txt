THE MAJOR VISITS THE WHITE
HOUSE.
Makes a Formal Call, and Is in Turn
Called Upon by the
President.
WASHINGTON. D. C, March 3.-The
President-elect passed a very active day
He received a large number of callers,
made a format risk at the White House
and took dinner to-night with Colonel
John Hay.
Major McKinley's most important call
ers, from a political point of view, this
morning were Messrs. Platt, Bliss and
Banna. Mr. Hanna and Mr. Bliss met at
breakfast ana had a long talk about the
New York situation. Mr. Bliss, who had
steadily and stouily declined up to that
time to reconsider his determination not
to become a member of the â  Cabinet,
finally agreed to do so and authorized Mr.
Ha:i;ia to say to Major McKinley that
Mr. Bliss would accept the position of
â  Secretary of the Interior if it were offered
â¢ ' to him.
Mr. .Hanna went over to the Ebbitt
House at once and in a short lime Mr.
. Bliss was summoned, and a few moments
later Mr. Plutt. A full, frank discussion i
lolloped, and then Mr. Bliss was offered a |
. portfolio in the Cabinet of Major McKin
ley.- .He will be Secretary of the Interior
unless Governor John .D. /Long, of ;
t !Â£Â«<â¢Â«;â¢ Inisffilli "â¢'a&'tniJd'rmdiviite a willing
ness to take that place, and if he does Mr.*
Bliss will probably be Secretary of ' the
,-. Navy.
i " Mr. Platt and Mr. Bliss understand each
pt'her thoroughly, and it is said they will
â  be jointly consulted about all important
â¢New. York appointments. Tiie Republi
- can lenders here express great satisfaction
over the appointment of Mr. Bliss. J-.v
, At 11 clock the Presiden .-elect diove
up 'to the White House in the rain
to. make the customary formal. call. Quite
a crowd had collected near tho portico in
â anticipation of his arrival, and hats were i
' removed with a slicht cheer when he j
alighted. Mr. McKinley acknowledged I
the ovation by smilingly lifting his hat
â¢ and nodding to the assemblage and then
quickly walked into the main corridor, ;
whence he was at once ushered through I
the crcat stained-glass screen to the blue '
'. room, .where President Cleveland and Sec
. retary Thurber stood expectantly. â¢
The hand-grasp of the retiring chief ex
.' BC*utive was noticeably cordial in greeting
his successor. Within two minutes after
his entry the President-elect and those
â accompanying him drove away.
â  'It lacked three minutes of the noon
hour when President Cleveland left the j

of the President, closed to suit the con
dition of tne weather, waited under a
portico for Mr. Cleveland's appearance,
while about a hundred people, held in
check by tbe policemen on duty at the

mansion, hovered near to see tne retiring
executive.
The President and his secretary, Mr.
Thurber, soon made their appearance
through the glass doors separating the
public lobby from the private apartments
of the White House family. When the
well-Known figure of the chief executive
was seen by the many visitors inspecting
the ea3t room a rush was made by them
in his direction, but the guards pre
vented Mr. Cleveland's progress from bo
ing interrupted. The President walked
with a perceptible lameness, consequent
on his attack of rheumatism, but made
rather rapid progress through the lobby
and across the portico to the waiting car
riaue. When Mr. Cleveland and Mr.
Tburber bad entered the door was
slammed by a policeman and the carriage
started off to the Ebbitt House. Com
paratively few people saw the President
alight, but while he was paying his duty
call the news spread around the hotel
tiint he was. there.
Major McKinley received President
Cleveland in the reception-room of his
apartments. With him was his secretary,
Mr. John Addison Porter, who extended
greetings to Secretary Thurber.
Tbe well-known figure and livery of
Breckett, the White House coaenman,
bad given the cue to others that Mr. Cleve
land was at tbe Ebbitt, and when the
President stepped from tbe elevater he
found a crowd of a couple of hundred
people assembled around the entnance of
tbe hotel. As be walkel through the lane
of humanity a round of hand-clappine
greeted him, and Mr. Cleveland responded
by taking off his bat. Then be and Mr.
Thurber were whirled off to the White
House, .where they ran tbe gauntlet of a
larger crowd.
During the short absence of tlie Presi
dent admission to the mansion had been
suspended, and as a consequence quite a
fair assemblage was awaitins his return â
more anxious, however, to see the retiring
President than to :et a glimpse of the
interior of his official home. They watched
him eagerly as he walued across the por
tico and Jobby and passed through the
glass doors.
Tben tbe entrance was thrown open
again and the President disappeared from
public view.
In tbe afternoon tbe Charles L. Kurtz
Republican Club of Columbus, Ohio, a
handsomely uniformed political organiza
tion, accompanied by the Columbus Glee
Club, serenaded Major and Mrs. McKinley.
The President-elect and bis wife came out
on the balcony to acknowledge the salute.
Mrs; McKinley was slightly indisposed
early in the afternoon, but. later took a
drive for an hour and a half with three of
her friends. This evening she was quite
in her usual healtb.
Among Major McKlnley'a callers this
afternoon were: Colonel J. J. McCook,
Senator-elect Fairbanks of Ind ana, John
E. Milbollaml, Congressman C. P. Taft of
Cincinnati, Vice- President Stevenston,
Henry Clay Evans and General H. F. De

the A. C. Hamer Club of Philadelphia ser
enad?d the President-elect.

The Supreme Court Decided
Against Durrant
Yesterday.
JUSTICE BEATTY DID NOT

He Is Now Preparing a Separate
Decision, to Ba Handed
Down Soon.

*; courts.
Justice McFar!and's Viewsâ The Pris
oner Re.'uses to Ste Reporters.
The Grieved Parents.
"We find no errors In the whole cave
which would substantially prejudice the
rights of the defendant." '. ;^v' '
Only one sentence, stior*. and worded so
as to be easy of comprehension by a child,
yet it sealed the fate of W. H. T. Durrant
and marked him as with the brand of
Cain for the gallows.
At last the revolving wheats of jus
tice have done their work and' by the final
decision of the Supreme Court of the State
of California the murderer of . Blanche
Lamont and Minnie Williams will meet
his deserts. â¢ -â -
As soon as the decision left the hands of
the Supreme Court Justices, about 4 p. M.
yesterday, the news was telephoned . to
Chief Jailer Satier at the County JaiL .
Proceeding to the cell of the doomed man
be informed Durrant of the decision
reached. _. . f, 'Â
"What is that? Who said so?" asked i
the prisoner eagerly, for a moment drop
ping that habitual air of ' coolness anil .
bravado which has distinguished ' him as
one of the most remarkable .'criminals jj of
the century. â¢' J --Â« ,: â â â -.â "''â  - ' . ' â  :^
--"Sailer informed him that ttie new? ha-1
just been received from the clerk's office
of the S; pi cm 3 Court, and that there
could be no doubt as to its authenticity.
In spite of this Durrant was loth to be
lieve that the court had decided against
him. .
When he came to realize its truth, ha
made the request that no reporters be ad
mitted to interview him. To this resolve
he firmly adhered, and refused to hold
any conversation at all with press repre
sentatives. , ''^
The decision was signed by all the court
except Chief Justice Beatty. When the
Chief Justice was questioned in regard to
bis refusing to sign the decision, he said:
"I canno t state why I refused to do so, .
for the reason â  that I am at work on a
separate opinion, now nearly finished. I
do not care to say whether it concurs or
not. However, as the majority of tha
court was in favor of denying the judg
ment and appeal, there was no use in my
delaying matters." '
Justice McFarland wrote a short conÂ«
curring opinion, although he had already
signed the principal decision. He said it
would have baen more satisfactory if the
trial had been held where the force of
public opinion was not so strong. The
main decision was written by Justice
Henshaw.
The trial of Durrant for the murder of
Blenche Lamont was one of the most
famous criminal cases in the history of "
the country and consumed many months.
He is also accused of the murder of Mm- â¢
nic Williams, both occurring in tha
Emmanuel Baptist Church of this City. t
Every effort possible was made to sara
the accused murderer by his counsel,
Eugene Deuprey and John H. Dickinson,
but the skein of evidence was too com
plete and woven in too strong and skillful
a manner by the District Attorney.
The case was tried before Judge D. J.
Murphy,, whose ; rulings on technical
points were so just that the Supreme Court
could find no flaw. JUurrant was convicted
and a petition for a new trial was denied.
Counsel for Durrant took an appeal from
both the judgment and denial of a new
trial. Altuough the public has in great
measure paid little attention to the case of
late owing .to the great lapse of time it
has engrossed the attention of the court
in bank for two weeks. The consideration
of the arguments presented crystallized in
yesterday's decision.
The decision in full is as follows: .

Deienoani and Appellant, J
The defendant, convicted of the murder of
Blanche Lament, prosecutes these appeals
â¢from the judgment and the order denying
him anew trial. .
Reviewing the specifications of error in
their natural sequence rather than in tha
order of their presentation ' in argument, tha
first which invite attention are, defendant's
challenges to the panel."' He- claimed that the
list of trial jurors had not been selected or re
turned as required by sections 20-1-209 of the
Code of Civil Procedure. In support of this
claim he offered the record of the proceedings
of the Jndues.of the Superior Court in, the
matter. This record, kept by the secretary of
the Judges, was incomplete. Under direction â â 
of the presiding Judge the secretary amended
his record, and as amended his minutes
showed a compliance with the law. The pre
si ing Judge likewise testified to the facts at
tending the selection and listing of the trial
jurors, from which it eared that tno pro
ctedines or the Judges were due and regular.
Defendant's claim that : the original ; minutes
of the secretary! were the sole evidence admis
sible upon the question-. cannot be sustained.
It was the inherent right of the court to cor
rect 1 its records to : make . them comport
with verity. (Kaufman v. Shain,; lll Cal.,
16 )- The secretary's minutes are now made
exclusive evidence of < the proceedings they
undertake to record. :It was the duty of the
trial Judge to determine the facts, and no bet- ,
ter evidence; could have been offered than .
that of the presiding Jud^e himself, an actor
in and creator of them. /
- Tue further objection that the Judges failed
IWP2
to comply with the law, in that of the
jurors selected some did not posses? tne requi
site qualifications, is equally untenable as a
.ground of challenge to tue panel. .(People v.Â«.
Young, 108 Cal., 12 ) To hold mandatory the
provisions of section 205 oi the Code of Civil
Procedure, and unis to require of the Judges
the strictest compliance with the law in the
matter of ill- selectiou of jurors, would M to
tho last degree unreasonable. They would
then be obliged to lay aside ell other business
and devote their time for day.*, and perhaps
weeks, to personal inquiry, inspection and
examination of 3000 men (the number of
jurors called for), and after this labor to de
oidÂ« at t4ioierilof a rejection of the whole
panel, thai io the final name Upon the list
fHC.'i uian possessed nil the qualifications of a
juror. The provisions of the Motion are di
rectory, and a suDstantial compliance with
them is Here shown and is all thai may be de
manded.
â Rrj;ardiiie Trial Jurors.
â¢ Section 204. of the Code- of Civil Procedure
provides that in counties and cities and coun
ties of more than 100.000 inhabitants the
Juiigos of the Superior Court shall select and
return trial jurors. Though the. section was
amended In 1881 and again in 1893 the pro
visions relative to cities and counties of over
100,000 inhabitant* remain unchanged so far
us affects this consideration. Before the pres
ent constitution went into operation the
jurors were selected by the District Judges of
.the several judicial districts within the City
and County of Sun Francisco, the County
â¢ Judge, the Probate Judge and the Judge of the
Municipal Criminal Court. The amendments
to the section made after the adoption of the
present constitution were designed to meet
' the new judicial system provided for by that
instrument. This section was a part of the
code beiore adoption of our present con
stitution,' and by that instrument (article
XXII, section 11) all laws relative to the judi
cial system tneu la force were made applica
ble to tho new system provided by the consti
tution/ Section 204 of the Code of Civil Pro
cedure was not unconstitutional under our
earlier organic law, and did not become un
constitutional by force of the present one. To
tne contrary, iho section was expressly re
â  tamed in force.
The court summoned jurors Dy special ve
nire. To iho panel thus lormed defendant ob
jected. The objection was not base.i upon
section 1064 of the Penal Code, but upon the
ground that the regular jury list had not been
exhausted. This is not a around for challenge.
(C. C. P., sections 220-227; Levy vs. Wilson, 09
Cal., Ill; Peop.o vs. Vincent, 95 Cal., 425).
"The court may summon jurors by special ve
nire without exhausting all of the names upon
the regular list.
Disallowed < hallenges.
To the jurors Crocker and Nathan chal
lenges were interposed for i dual bias, nnd"r
subdivision 2 61 lion 1073 of the Penal
â¢ ode. The challenges were disallowed.
.Whether or not the jurors Crocker and Nathan,
, or either of them, were shown to, be disquali
fied by actual bias against the defendant, and
therefore whether or not ttie trial court erred
in disallowing the challenges interposed to
them, is not under the facts presented by the
record a subject for consideration by this
court. The challenges lor cause having been
disallowed, the defendant d:d not see fit to ex
ercise his right of peremptory challenge I'pon
either of the jurors, but accepted them both.
When the jury was completed, defendant stilt
had in reserve and unemployed eight of Ins
twenty peremptory challenges. It bus in this
state been beid in numerous Instances that,
even if the Judge errs in disallowing a chal
lenge for cause, and. the defendant thereafter
excuses the obnoxious juror under a peremp
tory challenge, and the jury is completed
without the exhaustion by lac defense of all
of Its peremptory 'challenges, the error of the
court will, not be reviewed upon appeal, be
cause no injury could have resulted to the de
fendant. (People vs. Galewood, 20 Cal., 140;
â¢ People vs. rannt, '-':> Cm.. 15(5; People vs. Weil,
40 -Hi., 258; People vs. McGungill, 41 Cal.,
429.)
. I ie situation here presented differs some
what from that presented by the cases last
. above cited, but the reasoning which gov
erned the decisions in those cases is strictly
applicable to the one at bar. The defendant
may not have reviewed an error which he has
invited or has Galled to avoid by the legal
means at his command. If the defendant
.feared to put himself on trial bÂ«fore the jurors
whom ho had challenged, it whs his duty to
avail himself of the liberal aid which the<iaw
affords him and to have excused them from
the box. (i in so doing he lessened the num
ber of his peremptory challenges to such an
extent that it appears that they -were ex
hausted before the completion of the jury, he
may well be neurd to urge in argument that
by reason of the erroneous ruling the number
/of his peremptory challenges was improperly
curtailed and ho was deprived of a legal right;
but when it is show., a* here, that Ihe two
jurors in question were accepted and allowed
to remain, when the defense could have exer
cised peremptory challenges upon them, and
'further, thai at the time when the jury was
completed there was-still held in reserve by
the defense nearly half of its peremptory chal
lengesâ under these circumstances error
was committed by the trial court, it was either
acquiesced in by the defense or permitted by
its failure to exercise its legal right, and the
ruling will not be reviewed.
The Rule Overwhelming. -â ~
There will be found in the cases some slight
diversity of opinion upon the question, but
the great weight of authority is in support of
the view above expressed. Thompson on
"Trials, tien 120, thus declares the princi
ple: "It is a rule of paramount importance
that errors committed in overruling chulenges
for cause are not grounds for reversal, un
less it be shown an objectionable juror was
forced upon the challenging party after he
had exhausted his peremptory challenges; it
his peremptory challenges remain unex
hausted, so that he might have excluded the
objectionable juror by that moans, he has no
ground of compialnt." The rule above staled
finds overwhelming support from the authori
ties, of which a low maybe cited: State vs.
Gooch, 94 N. C. 987; Williams vs. the State,
30 Tex. App. , 354; State vs. Le Huff, 40 La.
An., 540"; State vs. Yetzer(!a), ('>â¢! X. W. Rep..
737; State vs. Hartley (New), 40 Pac Rep..
372; People vs. Aplin, Sti Mich., 393; Brura
back vs. German National Bank. 4(5 Nob , 540;
Prewitt vÂ«. Lambert, It) Colo., 7; Spies vs. The
People, 122 111., 1.
Nine jurors had been sworn to try the case.
At this stai:e of the proceedings the District
Attorney asked and obtained permission of
the court to reopen the examination of one
of these (Brown), and to question him upon
matters which had come to his knowledge
since his acceptance 1 as a juror, Permission
was granted over objection and exception of
defendant. At the conclusion of the examina
tion the District Attorney asked leave to in
terpose a peremptory challenge to the juror.
Leave was given, and this ruling was assigned
as error. Section 1068 of the Penal Code pro
vides that a challenge (either peremptory or
for causÂ«i must be taken when the juror ap
pears, <i:id before he is sworn to try the cause,
but the court may for cause permit it to be
taken after the juror is sworn, and before the
jury is completed. It was not error, there
lore, for the court to permit a re-examination
of the juror upon matters coming to the
knowledge of the people or defendant' after
his acceptance, and beiore the completion of
the jury. The course here pursued was that '
toll owed in People vs. Bemmerley, 87 Cal.
117, and approved by this court. â¢
Brown and the Unwell Case.
The uew matter upon which the juror Brown
was questioned touched his connection with
the case of one Ho well, who hud been tried in a
Federal court for passing counterfeit money.
Brawn had been a juror in the case, and with
others had voted for Howel.'s acquittal. The
result was Â« disagreement of the jury, and a
mistrial. Rumors thai the Howeil jury had
been approached and corrupted were current,
and toe next Federal Gratia Jury instituted an
investigation. Brown was summoned before
it and interrogated as to his knowledge of the
natter, but in justice it should be added that
the record before us does not disclose that his
own integrity was under assault.
There was undoubtedly not enough in this
to warrant the interposition of a challenge for
cause, .but section 1063 of the Penal Code con
templates also the taking of a peremptory
challenge, as one does in this case. When the
code bays that the court may tor cause permit
the challenge to be taken it means as the
language has been interpreted thÂ» t it is no; a
matter of right to either parly, but may be
permitted in the exercise of a sound discretion
(People vs. Reynolds, 16 CaL. 123; People vs.
Montgomery, 53 Cal., 576: People vs. Bern
merly, 87 UaL, 117); and as said 111 People
vs. 'Montgomery, in granting or refusing
permission. It will not be presumed that the
court has abused us discretion. As in ail mat
ters not ordered by inflexible rule, 110 set for
mula applicable to every case maybe laid
down to govern and measure the exercise of
discretionary power. As each MM arises its
determination must rest upon its peculiar
facts and what might be an abuse under one
set 01 circumstances mignt be a fair exercise
under another. In every case careful regard
will be had to see whether or not the subs'.an
tial rights of a defendant have been jeop
ardized or impaired, but. if they have not,
then the ruling iÂ« not to by disturbed, for at
ihc worst it could be but a technical error
which the court* are commanded to disre
gard. (Penal Code, Sec 1404) Having in view
the r. a. ure ot the District Attorney's inquiry,
and hi.> manifest suspicion that the juror was
or had been approachable and venal, it 'might
well be that Â«.s a result of the inquiry the
juror was loft i.i a stale of extreme hostility
to ihe prosecuting officer. ...
No Abuse of Discretion.
He upon bit pur: had tailed to establish
ground lor a challenge lor cause, ond if he
iouid net exercise a peremptory challenge he
would be compelled to try and argue his case
before a jiir>r wteOM attitude naturally was
one of bitter an t agon ism to him. It may
SRlely be said that, liowover disinterested it
juror might be as between the liUgfcaU, Do
advocate cberlstiinii lu.s client's interests
would willingly accept oue whom he believed
.o be hi* personal enemy. These obvious con
ideratiuui were m the miud of the trial
Judge. Moreover, tho defendant had not ex
hausted his peremptory challenges. Four
other jurors were obtained, to > none of whom
was auy challenge, taken by Ihe defense, and,
as has been said, when the: jury was. finally
completed there remained to tho defense
uuexerclsed eignt-ofiiis twenty peremptory
challenges. The ruling by which the prosecu
tion was allowed to interpose the peremptory
challenge worked no hardship 10 the defen
dant, liis right was to a fair and impartial
jury, not to a jury composed of any particular
individuals. Where it appears that a fair and
impartial jury was obtained it is the general
rule that an error of the court in allowing a
challenge and permitting a juror to be ex
cus dis not subject to review. (Territory vs.
Roberts, 9 'Mom. 12; State vs. Kleuman, 33
Minn. 341; State vs. Chin Ling, 10 Or. 410;
Snow v . Weeks, 75 Mo.. 103; Thompson vs.

Younsr. 1 Porter. Ala., 293: Richards vs. The
State, Nebr. 53 N. W. Pop. 1028.)
It cannot be said under t tie circumstances
shown that any injury resulted to defendant
from the ruling, or tuat any abuse of discre
tion is shown. (People vs. Arcot, 33 Col., 40;
People vs. Murray, 35 Cal., 350; People vs.
Murphy, 45 Cal., 137.)
The Evidence Juntifles the Verdict.
The contention of appellant next to be con
sidered Is that the evidence is insufficient to
justify the verdict, ana that tho verdict is
contrary to tno evidence in this, that the evi
dence fails to show how, when or where
Blanche Lamont was murdered, or that the
deiendani in any way was instrumental in
causing her death.
No small part of appellant's argument herein
is devoted to an attack upon the credibility of
the witnesses for the prosecution. In this at
tack the tersonal characters of many are as
sailed, and the unreliability of me evidence
of nearly all is insisted upon. It here again
becomes necessary to repeat that these argu
ments touching the credibility of witnesses
eminently proper'to be addressed to the jury
or to the Judge upon motion for a new trial,
are not for our consideration. This court sits
in criminal cases solely for the correction of
errors at law. If in any criminal case there
be evidence adduced logically tending and le
gally sufficient to prove the guilt of a defend
ant, this court cannot and will not disturb the
jury's determination, even under a claim that
there is conflicting evidence which might
have raised a reasonable doubt of his guilt.
The province of the jury in weighing evi
dence and determining the credibility to be ac
corded the testimony of witnesses isunder the
rules of law conclusive. A Judge mny not in
struct upon matters of fact. If a witness
should absolutely discredit his own testimony
by swearing to opposite statements, so that
one or the other must be false, under our laws
his testimony is not of necessity to be rejected.
It is still evidence in the case. Under such cir
cumstances the jury must receive and weigh it.
They are bound to look upon it with suspicion
and distrust and may reject it. But, upon the
other hand, they may as nicy determine accept
as true one or the other of the contradictory
asseverations. Thus, upon a review of the evi
dence by this tribunal, we may not examine
with minuteness claims that witnesses are dis
credited, or that their evidence is unworthy
of belief, or look to see whether some other
conclusion might not have been wnrranted by
the evidence. (Blythe vs. Avers, 102 Cat., 254).
Ad questionein juris respondeant judices, ad
quesiionem facM re-pondeant duratoresâ Â»nd
than this no maxim of the old law has been
more carefully preserved in its integrity under
our system.
Where It is not clear that tho verdict must
have been rendered under the influence of
pession or prejudice, our examination of the
recoid is only to determine whether legal evi
dence has been offered sufficient to warrant a
conviction, for the verdict of the jury is their
declaration that it is this evidence which has
been by them accepted. (People vs. Ah Loy,
10 CaL, 301; People vs. Vance. 21 Cat., 400;

Fact* of the Murder.
The following facts were presented in evi
dence: Upon April 3, 1895, Blanche Lamont
was living with her aunt, Mrs. Noble, in the
City and County of San Francisco. She was in
person rather tall and slight, and weighed
about 120 pounds. Her age was 21 years. She
was a schoolgirl attending the High school,
and upon the morning of April 3 left nor
home, with her sfap of books, to join her
classes. She met defendant while on the way
to school (such is his testimony), and
he accompanied her for a part of
the way. She was at ." school .during
the day's session, and at its close, about 3
p. m., left with the other pupils. She did not
return borne, and never after that day was
seen alive. Shortly after 9 o'clock upon the
morning of April 14 two police officers and the
janitor attempted to open the door leading to
the belfry of the Baptist Emmanuel Church.
They were prosecuting a search for Blanche
Lamont. The knob of the door was gone and
! the lock mutilated so that the janitor's key
could not open it. Taey forced the door
ana one of the officers ascending the stairs
found iho body of a girl lying on tho top
landing, in the southeastern corner of the
belfry. It was that of Blanche Lhmont. Thu
body was naked, lying upon its back, tho feet
close together, the hands folded upon the
breast, the head inclined a little to the left.
There were two small blocks, apparently em
ployed to hold the head in an ; upright posi
tion. Decomposition was well advanced, and
by medical testimony life had been extinct for
about two weeks. An examination and
autopsy of the corpse revealed seven finger
i nail incisions upon the left side of the throat
and five upon the right, a depression of the
larynx and a congestion of the trachea,
larynx, lungs and brain. Strangulation was
the cause of death. A search brought to light
the clothing and apparel of the girl hidden in
and about the rough underwork of the belfry
and also her bootstrap and schoolbooks.
Arrest of Durrant.
Upon April â the defendant was arrested
and charged with this murder. At that time
Durrant was a young man 24 years of age, a
student of the Cooper Medical College of San
Francisco, and a member of the Signni Corps
of the National Guard of trie State. He was
interested in religious work, was an attend
ant, it not a member, ol the Baptist Emman
uel church, was a member ot the Christian
Endeavor Society, was assistant superintend
ent of the Sunday-school, and was librarian of
the church library. As is abundantly testified
to, ne bore the esteem of his fellows as a zeal
ous, earnest and upright youug man of com
mendable character, and of sincere Christian
life. When arrested he was upon service of
the Signal Corps to. which he was attached.
Upon his trial his defense was an alibi. He
declared that he had won Blanche Lamout in
the morning of April 3, when she wa* on her
way to school, hut never again thereafter; that
he himself had gone to bis medical college,
and there had attended a lecture at the time
when by the claim of the prosecution the girl
hfld be/n by htm murdered in the church.
rpr.i the part of the prosecution it was
shown that Blanche 1.-amont was a regular at
tendant of Emmanuel Church, and belonged
to the society of Christian Endeavor, of which
Durrant was also a member. The two wero
well acquainted. Indeed, they seemed 10
have stood in their intercourse upon 'enns of
cordial and trusting friendship. They met at
social and religious gatherings, to or from
which Durrant frequently escorted the girl, in
company with her sister and other* of their
social circle. Durrant had a key to the side
door of the church, and whs thoroughly fami
liar with the building ana premises.
Some Important Witnesses.
Mrs. Hugh Vogel lived across the street from
the school which Blanche Lamont was attend
ing. S:ie saw defendant a little after 12 o'clock
o: the atternoon of April 3, in front of the
schoolhouse, walking up and down, apparently
In waiting. When school closed she noticed
two girls coming out together. One of them
carried books in a strap. They walked to the
corner cf the street, where ttoy stopped for
a car. The defendant joined them as they
were about to board it. One of the girls went
insidu. The other sat outside upon the dummy.
Toe defendant joined this girl and seated
himseli beside her.
Minnie Edwards testified that it was she
who accompanied Blanche LimoDt from
school that aiternoon. They wero Joined by
Durrant at the corner. Blanche Lamont and
he &at together outside, wiiiie she found a
â eat within the car. Banche Lamont had
her schnolbooks with her.
Mrs. Alice I 'organ at the time of these occur
rences was a pupil of the same school. Upon
that afternoon she, too, saw Blanche Lamont
upon th-j dummy in company with the de
fendant.
May Lanigan, another ot the schoolgirls,
also saw the two upon the dummy. This was
from fly.> to ten minutes after 3 o'clock.
Mrs. Elizaieth Crossett hud known the de
fendant for about four years. Between half
past 3 and 4 o clock of this afternoon, while
she was npon a Valencia-street car traveling
toward Twenty-fifth street, she saw detendant.
He was seated upon the dumm>* of her car in
company wMÂ». a young lady whom she did
not Know, but wnose description answered to
that of the mur lered giri. The two were in
convcrsniion and left ihe car at Twenty-first
or Twenty-second street and walked in the
direction of Bartleu street. The Emmanuel
Baptist Churcu is situated upon Bartiett
street, between Twenty-second and Twenty
third.
Martin Quinlan, between ten and ; twenty
minutes past 4. o'clock of this afternoon, saw
the defendant and the young lady whose de
scription corresponded -to that of the girl,
and who carried a loose package in her hand
by a string or strap, walking along Bartlett
street from Twenty-second street toward
Twenty-third street. - They -Â were Â«.: upon the
same side of the street as the church and were
walking toward it. - ;"- ; â  ' â
Mrs. Caroline Leake lived upon Bartiett
street, almost directly opposite the church.
Sue had been an attendant there at divine
service for many years. She had kuown de
fendant for the pant three or four years. She

also knew Blanche Lamont. Between 4 and
4:30 of this afternoon she saw Durrant and a
young lady pass though the gate into the
churchyard and on . toward the side door.
His pa lion she could not Identify posi
lively, but from her appearance thought at
the time that it was Blanche Lamont, or an
other young lady of similar- size and height.
This young lady testified that she was not
with 'defendant at any time upon that day
and no claim is made that she was. , ;
George King** Testimony.. .;
George King was a member of the church
and its organist. He knew defendant and the
two were very friendly. At 5 o'clock on this
afternoon he entered the church by the front
door, letting himself In with : his key. He no
ticed a strong smell of gas and went forthwith
to the library to see if it was escaping there,
He failed to find the leak. Thence, closing the
library door, he proceeded directly to the
Sunday-school room and sitting at the piano
began -to play. He played for two or three
minutes, when defendant came through the
toMing d'lors to the rear and stood looking.
Â«t him. "I asked him what was the matter,
because of his pale condition. Ho had his coat
off and his hat off. His hair was somewhat
disheveled: He came through and 'â  then told
me that he had been fixing the gas above
the auditorium and had been overcome by it
to such a degree that he could hardly descend j
the ladder. Ha seemed ill. Ho handed me a
50-cent piece and asked me to ; go and
get some broino-seltzer." Witness procured the
seltzer upon his return found the defend
ant either standing in the lobby or lying upon
the platform in the Sunday-scnool, room. He
think*, however,' that defendant- was -lying
down. : Defendant took a dose of the seltzer,
which seemed to nauseate him somewhat.
The two sat and talked together for a few
minutes, then went upstairs to the choir loft
and carried down a sum II organ. Peiendant
appeared weak and hed to stop two or three
times to rest. Then they went to the library
door, which Durrani unlocked, and entering
put on his hat and coat, which were lying on a
box in the corner. Witness, had not seen the
hat or coat when he went' into the library the
first time that afternoon. They then left the
church and walking some distance together
separated and went to their respective homes.
It was then about 0 o'clock. . â  â¢â 
Upon the morning of April 13, ten days after
the disappearance of Blanche Lamont and one
day before the ' discovery of her body, her
aunt, Mrs. Noble, received through the mail a
package which contained alt of the rings worn
by her when she left her home. The rings
were inclosed in a copy of the Examiner, and
upon the paper were wriue i-' the names of
George King and Professor Scnernst.'in. King
was a common friend of Durrant and Blanche
Lemon t. ; Professor Schernstein was her music
teacher. Neither of the two wrote th>* name.
The paper and wrapper were exhibited to the
jury, â  together- with admitted exemplars of
defendant's writing.
Sale of the Ring. . .
Upon a morning between the 4th and 10th
of April Adolph Oppenheimer, a pawn-broker,
was offered for i=a!e a gold ring containing a
diamond chip. The ring was identified as one
worn by Blanche Lament at the time of her
disappearance, and subsequently returned to
her aunt through the mail. The person offer
ing the ring for sale was the defendant.
William Phillips testified that some time in
the first port of April he saw defendant stand
ing in front of Oppenhctmer's place between
10 and 11 o'clock in the morning. â 
" Dr. G. F. Graham ; was ' a student ' and' class
mate of Durrant's at - the Cooper Medical Col
lege. From 3:30 to 4:15 p. M. of April 3 Dr.
Cheney of : thai college delivered a lecture to
his class upon the sterilization of 'milk. Dr.
Graham attended that lecture and took notes
of it. The defendant, in support of. his alibi,
claimed to have attended the lecture, and like
wise to have taken original notes, which were
admitted in evidence. Dr. Graham testified
that alter Durrani's arrest, and before the
trial, he visited him with a friend. Durrant
requested his companion to withdraw that he
mi;.; Nt talk to Dr. Graham alone. When he
had done so defendant iiuormed Dr. Graham j
that he had no notes of the lecture, and re
quested the doctor to- lend him hi*, saying
that if be could get them he in -a e-tubllsh an
alibi. Defendant told him that he could take
the notes to purrant'i house, get his book and
put them in it, and the oook could be brought
to him in jail, or that the witness could com
mit his notes to memory, come to the jail and
repeal them to him. -
Summary of the Evidence.'' 'â 
This summarization of the evidence is not
designed to bo exhaustive.. Much that is
cumulative upon the part of the people is
omitted. No analysis is made ol the alibi of
the defense, or of the claim of the f>ros?cu lion
that, when not completely demolished, it
stnuils upon the unsupported word of the de
fendant. Enough has been set forth to show
that the verdict and judgment finds support
from legal and sufficient evidence, and when
that point is reached the inquiry of this court
comes to an end. saving in those: exceptional
ca>cs, of which this is not one, where the evi
dence against the defendant is so slight as to
make clear the inference that the verdict must
have been ; rendered . under the ," influence of
passion or prejudice, (People, vs. Vance. 21
Cal., 400; People, vs. Manning, 48 Cat., 335.)
By this evidence thtÂ» defendant and Blanohe
Lamont, she with her strap of books, entered
the Emmanuel Church at about half-past 4
o'clock in â¢ tho : afternoon of April ; 3.. At 5
o'clock defendant is seen there, and explains
his distressed : condition as caused by t:ie in
halation of gas. : At 6 o'clock he leaves the
church. Blanche Limont is never again .-ecu
alive. . Two weeks nfter her nude and decom
posing: body Is found in the church. She had
been strangled and her corpse dragged to the
belfry. The clothes which she wore on. leav
ing home are secreted about the floors and
rafters. Her books are found, still tightly
strapped. Tr.ese tacts, with the others set
forth, are sufficient to justify the hypothesis
of defendant's guilt nnd to exclude every
other reasonable hypothesis than that of his
guilt. ; Such evidence is clear sufficient "to
warrant | and uphold the determination that
the girl was strangled to death at the hands
of the defendant up.in the afternoon of Aprils.
The evidence of defendant's previous good
character, so fully established, \va-> a circum
stance making; strongly in his favor. " We are
asked to say that the jury disregarded it in
reaching their verdict, but this we cannot do.
They were fully .and fairly instructed upon
the matter, and it must be. presumed that the
instructions were regarded. 'V ;t ' '.'
Moti^ for the Crime.
Appellant further urges that the evidence
fails to . disclose â :â  any motive i for the crime ;
that proof of motive is essential to support a
conviction, nnd that, therefore, the judgment
must 'be reversed. vlf by this is meant % that
proof of a particular . motive must be as clear
and cogent as the proof of tha crime the prop
osition finds no support either In reason or
authority. To the act of every rHtional human
being pre-exists a motive. In every criminal
case proof of the moving cause is permissible,
and oftentimes is valuable; but it is never es
sential. When the perpetration of a crime
has been brought home to a defendant the mo
tivo for it' commission becomes unimportant.
Evidence of motive is sometimes of assistance
in removing doubt and completing proof which
might otherwise be unsatisfactory, and that
motive may either be shown by positive evi
dence or gleaned from the facts and surrouud
iugs of the act. The motive then becomes a
circumstance, but nothing more than a cir
cumstance to be considered by the jury, and
its absence is equally a circumstance in
favor o f the accused, to be given
sucr: weight us they deem proper. But proof
of moiive is uever indispensable to a convic
lion. (People vs. Bennet', 49 N. V., 13V;
Pointer vs. United States. 151 I". 5..39H; John
son vs. United States, 157 U. 8., 157; Cliiton vs.
Stnte, 73 Ala., 473; Bumnsr vs. *'.ate, 5 Blackf.
Ind., 579.) The uel [springs of human cotiducl
are infinite, and infinitely obscure. An act
may owe its performance to complex ana mul
titudinous promptings.
Who knows each chord, its various tone,
Each spring, its various bias.
Or the deed may be due to a single motive,
so black, *o horrible, so monstrous, that even
when thts books i>i the learned cnminologist
have been studi- ! the no-mtil mind still
shrinks from a beiief in the possibility of its
existence. In this case, what the motive may
havo been it is not th* province oi this court
to inquire.
Attitude of the Press.
Purina the lmpanelment of the jury, the
defense made application for citations ngainst
certain newspnper editors to show cause why
they should not be punished lor contempt
because of their publications relative to the
trial. The court refused to interrupt the pro
ceedings to consider the matter ti.en, and post
poned action, statins that at a proper time it
would upon request take such steps tis might
bo contemplated by law. Again, during the
impaneiment of the iury. the application was
renewed, and the ccuri's response whs the
same. No further request was. made, and th.-re
the niÃt.er was allowed to stand. This is
urged as reversible error.
While a contempt proceeding for convenience
is presented in the cause out oi which it grows,
it is a separate and distinct matter, aud no
part of the original case. (Ex parte Ah Mon,
77Ca1.,196.) l-ower to punish for contempt
is vested in oi>urts for their own protection.
Its object and purpose is to iusure respect for
their rules and orders, obedience to their pro
ceÃses, and fre dom from disturbance or inter
ference with the due and regular course of
their proceedings. (5 Am. anil Enc. Enc. of L.,
p. 780; Thompson on Trials, Sec 124.)
A publication during the course of a trial
which reflects on the court, or assails the liti
gants, or seeks to intimidate witnesses, or
spreads before the jury an opinion upon the
merits of the controversy, or threatens them
with public odium, or attempts to dic:ate the
decision, or in any improper way endeavors
to influence the determination, is unquestion
ably a contempt ot court (in re. Shortrid *c. 99
Cu1.,532); but at the same time & litigant bus
no appeal from the action of the Judge m
dealing with the matter. The litigant may
not control thiÂ» process, which is dcs gned ior
the protection of the court, and which is to be
invokod or not, us its discretion may diciate,
but which should be employed freely where
the interests of justice or the rights of liti
gants demand it. '-The doctrine is well nigh
without exception that the issuance vel non
of contempt proceedings lies ia every inÂ«:ance
in the scuud discretion of the coun." (4 Enc.
Plead, and Prac, p. 774.) if by tne failure of
the court ;o proceed ngainst the editors orany
of them defendant has failed to obtain the fair
and impartial trial to which the law entitles
him, he may make that appear upon his mo
tion mr a new trial, and the question will thus
pome before us properly for review, In this
ca*^ the question is raised in the manner indi
cated, and It will be considered upon the nier-
Us in its proper place.
Killing* of the Court.
Numerous objections were made and excep
tions reserved o the court's rulings in admit
ting and rejecting evidence. Thege rulings
have been suijcctedto critical examination,
including those which in appellant's briei re
ceive no discussion, but are grouped by num
ber and co.lectively assigned as error. While
none, therefore, have been ignored, we will
here consider only such as merit particular
mention.
a. Dr. Barrett was shown to be a practicing
physician uud surgeon. He perf. rmed the
autopsy- upon the body of the dead girl, gave
evidence of its condition, and expressed his
judgment that the cause ot death was strangu
lation. He was then asked, "Wnat in your
judgment was the means used for the strangu
lation ?" Objection was made upon the sole
ground that no proper foundation had been
laid for the quesuo- . The objection was :
properly overruled. The objection does not
present the point that the fact sought to be
elicited va- not the subject of expert |
inquiry; nor is that proposition argued '
in the briefs. That being coucede<l, theobjec- j
tion that a proper foundation for the question I
nad not been laid, could not be sustained,
when the witness was a physician and (surgeon,
whose competency had been abundantly
shown. Theuitn-'ss answered: "I think toe
raet.ns used were hands." The appellant in
sists that tne court erred in refusing to strike
this answer out, a- the question called for the
v. ituess' judgment, ana he only gave his
thought. The expressed thought ot the ex
pert was clearly his judgment.
b. 'I he clothing of Blanche Lamon t admitted
as exhibits was draped upon a dressmaker's
frame, winch itself was not in evidence. It
was not claimed that the frame represented
the height, size or figure of the girl. Error is
predicated upon :he use of the frame and the
refusal of the court to order the garments fe
moved Iron it. Tne frame tfforded a con
venient mode for displaying the we: r ng ar>
parei, concerning which mucn evidence was
taken. We can discern no more impropriety
or irreKwarlty in the plan pursued than if the
garment* had been hung upon a clothesline
or huddled into a corner.
c. Mrs. Vogel, cross-examined by the defense
and a-<ke'\ how she fixed the date* upon which
sne saw Durrant as being April 3, replied that
it was because of a postal card which her hns
band receive! that day and which had been
directed to 732 Nntoma street. "That place
we own, but is occupied by tenants. 1 have
never lived there."
"Q.â Well, is that your property or your hus
band's property?
"A.â What he got is mine; what I got is his.
"Q.â Do you understand my question? I
H-kt-.l you in whose name doet the title to this
t property on Naioma street rtandT" Her* the
Judge interposed, and stating that he could
see no possible materiiUitv or relevancy to the
question, instructed ihe witness that she need
not answer. There was in this no error. In
deed, it is the duty of a court, nnd one not
often enough performed, to expedite business
by curtailing cross-examinations upon imma
terial and irrelevant matters. We cannot per
ceive the slightest pertinency to the !â¢ quiry.
No question of right or title to property \vas
even collaterally or remotely involved, and
had tho witness answered, the subject being
immaterial matter educed on cross-examina
tion, the defense would have baen Dound by
her statement, without right to impeach it,
even hnd it been false. (C. CL P., Sec. 2408.)
d. Mrs. Crossett declared that to the best of
her recollection the young lady whom she
saw with defendant wore a broad-brimmed
hat, light, with large bows and feathers in
front. She did not recognize the hat exhibited
to her, which ha<t been proved to be the one
worn by the dead girl. She was then asked:
"Can you tell whether it was .a hat similar to
that tnis young iady wore?" Objection was
made that the witness iiad already stated that
she could notrecognize it. The court permitte<!
the question, snying: "I think they have a
right to ask whether there is any similarity,
and, if so, what similarity there is betwee'u
the hat shown to her a:id the hst &ho saw the
young lady wear." Tho manifest soundness of
the ruling renders comment unnecessary.
The same witness wits interrogated on cross
examination as follows:
"Q.â Have you seen him (Durrant) at all
since last September, 1894?
"A. â Yes, sir
"Q. â That is, you imagine you have?
"Mr. Barnesâ l object to the question.
"The Courtâ That would not be proper. The
lady is telling what she has seen. Ido not
mink when a lady says 'I nave seen him since
September' that counsel has a right to say
'You imagine you did.' * * â¢ It disconcerts
t..e witness and Ihrowa a very serious doubt
upun the statement. You should have the
right to cross-examine this witness and all
other witnesses, but I do not coucede that this
is a proper way to do it.
â¢ "Mr. Deuprey â We will have to take an ex'
cepion.
"The Courtâ You have your exception, cer
tainly, to every ruling of the court, but 1 say
that this and all witnesses in this court are to
be treated fairly.
"Mr. Deupreyâ l did, sir, treat this witness
fairiv.
"Tho Courtâ The court does not believe you
have.
"Mr. Deuprey â I take an exception to the
court's remarks."
Upon this rilling and these remarks error is
affirmed. It is the richt of a witness to be
protected from irrelevant, improper or insult- '
ing quest'ons and from harsn and insulting ;
demeanor; to be detained only so long as the
interests of justice require it; to be examined
only as to matters legal and pertinent to the
issue. (C. C. P., Sec. i2O6t>.) The protection
which the Code thus affords to witnesses could
be more often extended by Judges wiih a sal
utary effect upon judicial proceedings. The
witness, a lady, had testified courteously and
positively that she had seen defendant str.ee
the date named. The interjection ot counsel
was not legimate cross-examination and jusil.
fled the interposition of the court.
E. Blanche Lamont's si-tor Maud was living
with her at the time of her ilis:ippearanca.
She was a picture of Blanche taken
about three years before tne dftte of her testi
mony and was asked whether or not the pho
tograph was a fair representation of her sister
as she was upon April 3. Over objection and
exception slie was permitted to answe. It is
a general rule without contradiction that
where the photograph is shown to be a faith
ful representation of what it purports io r. pro
duce it is admissible as an appropriate aid to
the jury in applying tho evidence, ami this is
equally true whether the photoeraph be of
perse ns, things or places. (Rice. Crim. Ev ,p.
154; Wharton, Crim. Ev., Ninth Ed., section
544; Thompson on Trials, section 869) The
fact that the photograph whs taken two or
more years before the date of the nirl's di^np.
pearance did not justify its exclusion after
the testimony of the sister that it fairly repre

mony, and c.indidly exp.a ns ii as arisins
from a doubt created by his former cross-ex
amination. There was here no imnropiieiy,
and no injury to defendant.
The Janitor's Statement.
C. The janitor ot the cliurch was asked,
upon direct-examination, U uny one besides
h'mself had a key to his room. He replied:
"I have sometimes left my room door locked
and found it open ; therefore, I concluded that
some one hud a key to it." The refusal of the
court to strike this answer out is assigned hs
error, "because by*ts nature the answer only
had a tendency to cloud the minds of the
jury," and "necessarily injured the case of de
lendant." \\e are unaoie to porceive any force
in these objections.
H. The body of Blanche Lament wns found
nude and prune upon its bur k, with- a small
wooden block upon each side of the head, ap
parently us^d to hold it in an upright posi
tion. Dr. Charles E. Farnum was culled for
the people and testified that he was the
Demonstrator of anatomy at the Coopei- Medi
cal College, whioh defendant attended, and
that wooaen bi> cks were used Jor purposes in
relation to deÃd bodies. He was next asked:
"For what purpose ure they used?" Ot jeetion
was made mat the question was irre.evant,
Immaterial and incompetent for any purpose.
Thelii.e of proof sought to be established
by the prosecution whs quite ttpparent. It
was an endeavor to show by me demonstrator
of anatomy under whom defendant was study
ing some technical and peculiar use of wooden
blocks in connection witn dissecting-room
corpses similar to the use made of blocks about
the heÂ«d of the body of the dead girl. The
court could not foresee the answer and prop
erly overruled the objection ; for if the propo
sition could De establisned. it was clenrly com
petent lor the psi p.e to do so. In this, how
ever, there was a signal failure. The answer
disclosed no possible coi. section between the
facts in the case ot the dead girl aad the cus
tom of tne dissecting-room. Wliiie the ques
tion was pertinent, the answer therefoie failed
to luruish the required proof. It would un
questionably have been stricken out en mo
tion 01 the defense. But no motion was made â
doubtless because the answer not only worked
no Injury to the defense, but was an affirma
tive advantage to it
A Hypothetical Case.
The record next discloses the following ques
tion, objection, exception aud answer:
'â¢Q. Let me put a hypothetical case to you
for a moment: Suppose you had in your cus
tody or care a body which hail but recently
died, and it was still almost warm with nio.
You are acquainted with anatomy and sur
gery, and you know that in a certain length of
time rigor mortis would set in, when the body
and the members of the Dody would become
â stiff. Mow, II yon wanted to keep the neadâ *â 
tho face and neck â in an upright p jsit.oa, in
a straight position, not turned to one side or
the other, what would you do in order to keep
it in that position ?
"Mr. Deupreyâ Wo object to that a? net a
hypothetical question involving any elements
iv this case.
"Objection overruled.
"Deiendaut excepts.
"A. I would place it first in the position in
Which 1 wanted it, and if it did not remain
there I would prop it by supports in the de
sired position. My lust answer is what las an
individual would do."
The objection, it wiil be noted, is not upon
the ground tint the inquiry is not a subject
of expert evidence, but is based upon the one
proposition "that the hypothetical question
does not involve any elements in the case."
In strictness, therefore, this consideration
might begin andemt with a disposition of tne
sineie ground of objection urged, and when it
appears, us by fair inference it diu-s, thnts me
one hwd murdered the girl, and that some
one was present with her still warm body, and
that some one placed the blocks for the pur
pose of holding the head upright.it certainly
cannot be said that none of the elements of
the ease were involved in the hypothetical
question. Indeed, while counsel for tne ap
pellant, arguing this proposition, strenu
ously insist that, "There is no evidence
in the record that any person wanted to keep
the head, the face or the neck in an up
right or any position, or in a straight posi
tion, not turned to one side or ;he other;
there was nothing in the way of circumstance
or in the wuy ot iact established that would
permit the presumption of the conditions
lorced into the so-called hypothetical ques
tion," we need but tur.i bacK four pages of
their brief to find the curiously destructive
dec aration that, "The fancy struck tne mur
derer ot this girl to place the heart in a cer
tain position â and he did the most natural
thine in the world, picked up a couple of
sma. 1 blocks, evidently lying near, to hold the
head iv the position desired."
Moreover, a hypothetical quertiou need not
embrace all the facts in evidence, or even be
limited to facts proved. It must be based
upon facts tn evidence, but inny be addressed
to any reasonable theory which may be taken
ol them. In Filer t?. N. Y. R. Co., 49 N. V.,
46, it is is well said: I- It is the privilege of
counsel to assume, within the limits ot the
evidencp, a:iy state of facts which he claims
the evidence justifies and base the opinion nf
experts upon the facts thus assumed. The
facts are assumed for the purpose of the ques
tion, and fo- no other purr>o<e."
In â¢Thompson on Trials" (Seo. 604) the rule
is thus aptly and succmtly ,-tated : â â¢Ttte rule
then is that the hypothetical questions must
be baseu either upon the hvp,,thesis of the
truth of ail the evidence, or upon a hypothesis

TO OFFER PROOF
The Monarch of the Fakers
Has Naught to Say
of Bribery.
Trying to Turn Aside the In
vestigation Begun by the
Legislature.
Will Attempt to Cover Its Dishonesty
by Clouim^ tbe Issue Before
the Committee.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 3.â Fred
Lawrence, brother of the managing editor
of the Examiner, came up from Ban Fran
cisco last night with the Examiner corres
pondent who had made a flying trip to the
Ciiy to receive instructions as to the man
ner in which the interests of the Exami
ner should be guarded belore committees
appointed by both houses to investigate
the faked libel recently published by that
paper. Mr. Lawrence came flying into
the Golden Eagle Hotel with wnat is
known aa "a fine front."
"The Examiner is going to make a big
fight on this matter," he said.
"It is not making any fight in its
editorials," was suggested. "It appears
to be retracting its original statement on
the installment plan."
Mr. Lawrence's reply was an intimation
that the apparent weakness of the Exami
ner was only on the surface.
The correspondents and others on the
Examiner's payroll are making a big fight
here, after the lines laid down by Mr.
Caminetti the other day. The plan of ac
tion is to cloud the issue and to swerve
the investigation off in the direction of
the merits of the bill. An attack will be
made upon it. The statement will bs
prominently put forward that Alvinza
Hay ward is interested in the bilJ, aud that
Mr. Hay ward is a millionaire, as is Mr.
Hearst, who is interested in the defeat of
the bill. There will be elaborate argu
ments concerning the reason why the bill
should not become a law, but when the
Examiner's witnesses will be asKed what
ttiey know about Senators being bribed
for from $350 to $500, and Assemblymen
being bought in droves at $150 each, they
will be as innocent and as ignorant as the
babe unborn. Only one of them will know
anything of his own knowledge as to now
the article came to be published.
Two stories in relation to the matter are
current here. One is that the chief of staff
received from the editorial rooms of the
Examiner on Mission street a tip to send
down the story for the purpose of making
a sensation and of preventing the approval
of the bill by the Governor. The other
story is that the matter was written
wholly in the editorial rooms of the
Examiner in San Francisco for the pur
poses outlined and because of the fact that
that paper had been "scooped" so often by
Ins ,Caz,l and Chronicle oo ; legislative
t>Â£w* <vat it vas necessary to make a Ping
Yang play to the gallery in E .order to brace
up its shattered reputation.
It is reported also that agents of the
Examiner have withdrawn from the tele
graph offices all telegrams passing between
the Exammer and its correspondents in
relation to the bribery libel. If the article
was written in this City the correspondent
will raise tha point that he cannot be com
pelled to betray the secrets of his em
ployer and the paper will place him in the
role of a martyr.
But these tactics will be met by a few of
the determined investigators in the only
honest and direct way. The manager of
the paper will be asked to prove the
charges of bribery against members of the
Legislature. If he cannot do this, and
odds of a thousand to one are offered that
he cannot, the lie and the iake will be
crowded down the throat of the Monarch
of. Fakers.
The committees feel that this is the only
issue to be investigated. The merits of
;ne bill have nothing to with the case.
Did the Examiner tell the truth when it
stated that legislators had been bribed?
That is the only issue before the commit
tees.
.Mr. Caminetti and his friends in both
houses may be relied on to do all in their
power to prevent an investigation on these
lines. Mr. Caminetti outlined that idea
in his remarks on personal privilege, for
he neither denied that members had been
bribed nor did he address himself to that
phase of the case at all.
Both committees will meet to-morrow
afternoon at 2 o'clock in separate apart
ments for the purpose of taking testi
mony. Each will devote its inquiry to the
charge of bribery made against its own
particular department of the Legislature.
. "I regard Assembly bill 273 as a very
meritorious one," said J. D. Sullivan, ex-
District Attorney of San Francisco.
"There are many lawyers who would be
glad if the biil became a law, because it
would protect their clients in their rights
against biased and dictatorial Judges, of
which there are more than one in the va
rious counties of this State."
Andy Lawrence arrived on the late
train to-night and declined to be inter
viewed. Immediately after hi 3 arrival he
went into consultation with A. J. Clunie
ansi (rarre: McEnerney, the attorneys for
the Examiner.
It was learned to-night after Andy
La^ rence's arrival (hat the Examiner will
attempt by a bold bluff to div rt the efforts
of the Investigating Committee Jrom ex
posing its fake story b/y demanding that
the private books of those interested in
the Haie & Norcro^s suit be brought into
the case and that the owners of tbe books
be also summoned as witnesses. Nothing
more impudent and audacious was ever
proposed to a court or any investigating
body. After direct and specific charges of
i/ribery have been made, and the strongest
kind of suspicion cast upon scores of legis
lators, who were mentioned by name, it
w;il now be sought by the manager of a
newspaper to shield himself and his sheet
from wtll deserved contempt and puni h
ment by a still more cowardly expedient.
The consensus of opinion to-night is that
absolutely nothing will be developed to
prove that bribery was resorted to in se
curing the passage of the Caininetti bill,
and that the only result of tbe investiga
tion will be to prove once more that tbe
Monarch of the Fakers cannot yet shake
off the habit acquired and become second
nafure by long years of uractice.

SACRAMENTO, Cal.. March 3.âDen

and incorporated athletic clubs to conduct

not more that twenty rounds was defeated
in the Assembly to-iiiuht.
ADJOURNMENT NOT IN SIGHT.
Assembly Rsiuses to Concur in the Report
Fxing March 13 as the
Closing Day.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 3.âAd
journment is the question that leads all
others in interest just, now in the Capitol,
and no one appears to have any definite
idea when it is to come. For tha past few
days the Senate and Assembly have vainly
endeavored to come to an understanding
relative to tlie matter, but the two bodies
are still at loggerheads.
The differences between the two houses
arose over the proposition to abrogate
joint rules 40, 48 and 49. Rule 40 provides
that joint resolutions, constitutional
amendments, deficiency bills, claim?, the
general appropriation bill and the tax levy
bill shall be considered only during the
last twelve days before adjournment.
X ule 48 provides that no bill shall be pre
sented to the Governor for approval sub
sequent to the tweitth day preceding the
day of adjournment sine dio, excepting
revenue bills, deficiency bills and bills for
claims against the State. Rule 49 pro
vides that adjournment sine die shall
only be made oy concurrent resolution,
and that at least tweive days' notice shall
be given of adjournm-nt sine die.
The main oojÂ°cts aimed at in all these
rules is the prevention of vicious legisla
tion during the nurly-burly of the la^t
days of the session, and also the preven
tion of pocket vetoes by the Governor.
During the session of the Legislature
the Governor has ten days with which to
signify his approval or disapproval of a
measure, and should he fail to act at all
on any bill, it becomes a law at ;he ex
piration of the ten-day limit. But any
bill presented to the Governor subsequent
to the ten days preceding adjournment
sine dine, must receive his signature to
become a law. Should he fail to sign such
a bill within ten days after its receipt by
him, it fails to become a law, without
placing upon the Governor the responsi
bility of vetoing it.
As the matter now stands both houses
have agreed to abrogate these rule?, but
the members of the free conference com
mittee included in the report recommend
ing the suspension of these rules a resolu
tion providing for adjournment sine die
on Saturday, March 13. The Senate
adopted the report as a whole, but the
Assembly refuses to concur iv the resolu
tion to adjourn.
The motive of the Assembly is said to
be to force the Senate to adopt the gen
eral appropriation bill without amend
ment, as passed by the Assembly. The
Assembly had this bill in charge ior
three weeks, and the Senate proposes to
act on it with equal deliberation and to
consider it witn all the care that such an
important measure deserves and demands.
rhe leaders in the Assembly have given
out the information that the question of
adjournment will not be taken up in the
lower house until March 12, unless the
general appropriation is rushed back from
the Senate.
While all the members are anxious to
adjourn on March 13, many fear that the
session will have to be extended to the
20th, as there are stiii a large number of
bills to be considereii, many of great im
portance, which are likely to bring on
lone debates.
Among the latter are the general appro
priation bill; the county government bill,
which has been extensively amended in
the Assembly; the Bridgford bill, whicn
makes radical ana sweeping amendments
to the Wright irrigation law; the bill pro
viding lor a system of State roads, wh.ch
appropriates about $287,000 and is sure to
lead to a uot fight, aud tne coyote scalp
bill.
Both houses have still plenty of busi
ness on their hands, and even if tiie
session runs alone until the 20th, many
bills wiiJ aie on the files. The Senate lias
about forty bills on its third reading tile,
225 on the second reading tile and nearly
140 measures to be considered within the
laÃt twelve days, besides the consideration
of Assembly bills. The Assembly has
about 100 measures ready for third read
ing, 340 for second reading and lorty as
special orders.
In order to Rive the members an oppor
tunity to rescue their pet measures from
the danger of being smothered to death
under the heap of bills still on the files, a
special urgency file was made up to-night.
Each Senator will be allowed to select one
of his bills and place it on this tile, which
will be considered at the night sessions.
The rnpasures will be taken up in revers*
alphabetical order of the names of the
Senators who introduced them.
TO PROTECT GAME.
Both Houses Pass the Measure Making
Sweeping Changes in Existing
Laws.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 3.â After
being shunted back and forth between the
Senate and Assembly for more than a
month, and amended thrice in the former
body and twice in the latter, the new
game bill was fanally passed by the Sen
ate to-day and is now ready to be placed
in the hands of the Governor for his nc
tion. It makes sweeping chances in the
existing law* by repealing sections 626 a,

SENATOR BULLA'S VICTORY.
Assembly Refuses to Reconsider Its Vote
on His Land Transfer
Registry Act.
SACRAMENTO, Cau, March 3.-Sena
tor Bullu was happy this afternoon when
the Assembly voted down Toland's mo
tion to reconsider the vote by which his
land transfer registry act had been finally
passed on the day before. Toland made a
great fight against the bill and repeated
all the stock objections against it. Mead
iji reply said that he could get a shrewd
lawyer to prove that "the eleven com
mandments" were looiely drawn and un
constitutional. The matter had been fully
discussed by the press during the last two
years.
Hill of Humboldt raised the point that
the Supreme Court of Illinois had de
cided that th-? law was unconstitutional
because it authorized the taking of private
property without compensation and with
out due process of law. Valentine of Los
Angeles contradicted the statement. The
decision of the Illinois court was based
npon the fact that the law in that State
conferred judicial authority upon the
Registrar; Dut that objectionable feature
had been eliminated frum the California
law.
There were 27 ayes and 42 noes on the
motion to reconsider, an 1 the bill was
started on its wav to the Governor.
Tnis bill was foug: t by u strong lobby,
headed by Thomas F. Barry and ex-Mayor
Ellert of San Francisco, bacted by makers
of abstracts and searchers of records all
over the State; but Senator Bulla, single
handed, succjeded in allowing the Senate
and the Assembly that the objections
urged against the bill had no merit what
ever.
BELSHAW S BILL DISCUSSED.
Exciting Debate Over the Appropriation to
Pay Railroad Commissioners'
Experts.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 3.â There
was an exciting discussion this evening
in the Assembly over Assembly bill 320,
introduced by Belshaw, to appropriate
$30,000 to pay the experts and the costs of
litigation in tne case of the feouthern Pa
cific Company against the Railroad Com
missioners. In the course of his remarks
Austin of San Joaquin sa d that the South
ern Pacific Company had declared that it
could not afford a reduction of Ã percent,
yet wtien the San Joatjuin Valley road
made a reduction of SO to 50 per cent the
Southern Pac.fic Company voluntarily
made a similar reduction.
Leavitt of Alameda informed the House
that the proposition was to send East for
experts, and for that reason he was
opposed to the bill. He believed that
there were as good experts in California
as anywhere else, and he could not see
why home talent should not be employed.
Belshaw said that experts were bÂ«ing
looked for in the Eist, because there was
not a competent expert in the State who
was not in the service ot the Southern
Pacific Comoany.
Cross objected to the bill, because the
Attorney-Gt-neral had informed the Rail
road Commissioner* that he was able to
handle the case alone, but this did not
suit the Commissioners ai.d they ran ud a
$2J,000 attorneys' bi.l for some one else.
The bill was ordered engrosssd and sent
to third reading.
IX IBE Vri'KK BOUSE.
Review of the Day's Proceeding* in the
California Senate.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 3.â Tne
Senate this mornine was occupied with
the discussion of the bill to exempt the
Stanford University endowment from tax
ation. Stratton favored the bill. Simp
son said no legislation could affect the
status of the institution. He suggested
that if it was exempt from taxation, as
had been said, then that it refuse to pay
taxes, and so let the tribunals decide the
question. WithinÃton favored the bill,
iie said he owed ins own education to the
fact that Massachusetts academies and
Harvard University were exempted from
taxation. Dickinson said he could not vote
for the measure, ns it was clearly uncon
stitutional. Boyce favored the bill. He
said the constitutional point was a false
issue. Shippee opposed the bill; Voorheis
favored it. It was defeated by a vote of
25 to 14.
A bill was passed abolishing the offico
of attorney to the State Board of Health
after July 1.
Bulla of Los Angeles arose to a question
of privilege. Ha said he had been mis
quoted by Judge Lamme of that city on
Assembly bill 273. He said he thought it
was a good measure and he had no apolo
gies to make.
Bills were finally passed and now go to
the Governor providing for the organiza
tion of drainage districts; reducing sala
ries of Supreme Court, officers, and remov
ing girls from the Whittier Reform School
to the ofd home for the feeble minded at

Gillette moved to reconsider the pilot
bill, which was lost yesterday. Dickinson
opposed, and the motion was lost by a
vote of 17 to 2l. This effectually kills the
measure.
The Senate concurred in the Assembly
amendments to tbe rock-crn>hing and
Torrens land acts, thus disposing of two
bills which caused the hardest fighting of
the session.
The resolution providing for the ad
journment on the 13:h was reconsidered.
Wolfe moved to take up the Assembly
joint resolu;ion opposing the appointment
ot a commission by Congress to settle the
funding bill question. Smith raised the
point of order that the bill must under
the rules go into the twelve days' file.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 3.â An
interesting ceremony took place this
morning in the parlors of the Ebbitt
House, by whicn President-elect McKin
ley was made the recipient of a beautiful
diamond- set badpe, the official emblem of
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
President-elect McKinlcy id a member
of this Greek-letter college fraternity and
still takes great interest in it. When ho
was inaugurated Governor of Ohio he wore
on the lapel of his coat a very pretty
badge, and now, on his inauguration as
President, he will again wear his college
fraternity pin. This time, however the
badge, though similar in general design,
is more elaborate and costly, and is the
gift of the fraternity at large.
The National convention of the order at
St. Louis in December last provided for
the purchase and presentation of the
badge, and it is probably the handsomest
and most costly possessed by any mem

AXOTHER ifKVITLBSS CHASE.
The Lauradn Again Gets Away With
Arm* for Cuba.
NEW YORK. N. V., March 3.â The
revenue cutter Manhattan, which left her
pier last night on orders from Washing
ton for the purpose of overhauling a
Cuban filibustering steamer wnich was re
ported to be off Barnegat, N. J., returned
to this port thia evening after a fruitless
search for the vessel.
The Manhattan proceeded as far as
Barnegat, but did not sieht tbe suspicious
steamer, which is supposed to be the
Laurada. Tne Manhattan, while on her
return trip, blew out two of her boiler
tubes and had to be towed to her pier.
The famous filibuster Laurada, which
the cutter was reported to De in search of,
cleared from Baltimore Friday iast for
Philadelphia. She should have reached
the latter port on Sunday, but at iast ac
counts she had not yet arrived there.
Early on Monday morning a barge, a
schooner and a tug were sighted lying-to
off Barnegat.
In the course of the day tnis little fleet
was joined by a steamer, supposed to be
the Laurada, A laree number of boxes,
which probably contained arras and am
munition, were quickly transferred to the
steamer, and a number of men were also
seen to board Ler. This accomplished,
the steamer turned her nose to the south
ward and sailed, presumably for Cuba.
In Cuban circles here it is stated that
Carlos Roloff, who recently forfeited his
bail by not appearing for trial in Balti
more when his case was called, was in
command of toe expedition.
Tfl Ã SAVCI 1 11. 11l US TEB.
Jeers the Pinkertona White Taking on
Her Cargo.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 3.â lt was
definitely learned to-higbt that the steamer
which took aboard a cargo of arms and
ammunition off Barnegat was the Lau
rada. The news that the expedition was
off the New Jersey coast was brought to ;
port by two Pinker ton detectives, who were
aboard the Philadelphia tug Protector.
It was on their report that the Washing
ton authorities ordered the cutter Man
hattan out. These facts leaKed out to
night, and in addition the statement Is
made that the .filibusters on the Laurada
had fun with the Pinkerton men. r , â 
The Laurada anchored ten miles due
east of Barnegat on Sunday evening. The
brig Volunteer, with a schooner and
bars;e, were transferring munitions of war
to the steamship just as if L'ncie Sam had
nothing at all to say in the matter when
the tug Protector, which nad left Phila
delphia with the Pinkerton men on board,
hove in sight. There was much excite
ment on board of the Laurada before the
character of the tug was made out, but
when that was done the Cubans resumed
work.
The Protector steamed up and circled
about the Laurada two or three times,
while her officers got the name of the craft
that had bi ouch t out the arms and ammu
nition.
In the meantime, 100 dark-visaged fili
busters crowded the Laurada's deck and
taunted the dete ctives with jeering re
marks that the Laurada was seven miles
out of- the three-mile limit and that the
Protector's men had no authority to ar
rest those on board the vessel.

NEW YORK, N. V., March 3.âDis

Spanish 700. The Cubans were at first
victorious, but Spanish re-enforcements
arrive:! from Casiqua and the Cubans
withdrew into the woods. Nearly 200
Spanish were killed. The Cubans lost
fifty killed.

LONDON, Exg.. March 3.â Details of the
damage done by the gale continue to come
in, but owing to the general prostration of
the wires, they are still meager.

others the crews were rescued by hard work
on the part of the lifesayers.
The pier at Framington has been
crushed to pieces by the tremendous
seas, and a lartre number of wrecks are re
ported on the Devonshire coast.
The cale is still raging with no indica
tion of abatement in fury.
Reports of havoc wroueht by the gale
are continually being received. A dis
patch from Cardiff says a boat containing
six workmen was wrecked in the harbor
and its occupants drowned.
A number of trees in a churchyard at
Tiverton were torn up by tne roots, dis
placing great quantities of earth and ex
posing to view several coffins which, from
the inscriptions on the plates, had re
mained in the cemetery for a century.
The schooner Amaranth arrived at

acted that "flogging on board of vessels of
commerce is hereby prohibited."
. Dubois (Silver) of Idaho, chairman of
the Committee on Public Lands, pre
sented the report of that committee in
the case of the inquiry into the issue of
pantents for lands in the Perrine grant
in Florida, and Pettigrew (Silver) of South
Dakota presented a minority report. The
majority report justifies the action of
the department, while the minority re
port lavors the annullment of the pat
ents and the opening of the lands to
public settlement. Both reports were or
dered printed and went over without ac
tion.
Tne conference report on the Postoffice
appropriation bill (rinal) was presented
and agreed to.
The partial conference report made on
the Indian appropriation bill was agreed
to. TÂ«e points still left open are the Sen
ate amendments to contract schools to the
live civilized tribes; to the Uncompahgre
Indian reservation in Idaho, and to tne
fees of the attorneys of the old settler?, or
Cherokee Indians. A further conference
was ordered.
Consideration of House bills on the cal
endar unobiected to was resumed, and a
bill was passed to set apart a portion of
certain lands in the State of Washington,
now known as the Pacific forest reserve, as
a. public park, to be known as the Wash
ington National Park.
Hale(K.)ot Maine presented a partial
conference report on the naval appropria
tion bill and made an explanation of it.
He said all the general items in dispute
.h:id been arranged and that the contro
verted matters which were still open were
as to the increase of the navy by torpedo
boats and as to the price of steel armor for
ships.
Cuandler (R.) of New Hampshire, who
had offered tbe amendment-reducing the
pr.ee of armor to $CÂ»00 a tor., expressed his
regret thai the House conferees had not
apreed to it. Ho asked Hale whether the
couferees had had before them the ofier
of the Illinois Steel Company to suppij
the armor at $240 a ion.
Hale announced that it bad not been be
fore the Conference Committee in any for
mal manner, but thai it had been referred
to. Considering tne question of whether
it would be possible to get armor at that
price, which he considered doubtful, the
attitude of the Illinois Steel Company was
a fair consideration.
Chandler remarked that he had inquired
yesterday as to the time in wuich it would
be necessary for the builders of the battle
ship to have the armor-plates and learned
that it would De in about eight months
from this time. He had also been led to
believe that the new plant for the construc
tion of armor-plates could be put in opera
tion by that tims.
Gorman argued against a Government
manufacturing establishment, declaring
that with it the plate instead of costing
$400 a ton would cost $1000.
Seawell (R. ) of New Jersey said that as
a memler of the Naval Committee he had
favored the reduction of the price of armor
plate to ?4<X) a ton. The reductions which
had recently taken place in the price of
steel rails showed that the reduction in
the prico of armor plate was fair. He
risked Culiom whether the Illinois Steel
Company had made application to supply
armor at a les* price.
Culiom (R.) of Illinois said that he did
not know of any specific proposition hav
ing been made by that company in writ
ing. There h:is been a bill introduced in
the House to supply armor at $250 a to n
on certain conditions.
'What are the â¢conditions?" Seawell
aÂ«ked.
"Tnat they shou'd have the contract for
thirty years," Culiom replied.
After further discu-sion the report was
agreed to, and a further conference was
ordered. Other bills on the calendar were
passed, among them settlement of judg
ment agaiiifct William Locke and James
H. Tinsley, of Louisville, Ky., as con
tractors mr a mail contract oti pay
ment of $1102; denning jurisdiction of
United States courts in cases of infringe
ment of patents; to authorize the Pitts
burg, Monongaheiaand Wheeling Railroad
to construct a bridge over the Monon
g.iheia River; granting rights of wav to
the Galveston and Great Northern Rail
way through Indiun Territory, with an
amendment.
The filial conference report on the for
tifications bill was made and agreed to.
The immigration bill, which was to-day
passed over the President's veio by the
House, was laid belore the Senate. The
veto message was read, and with the bill
referred to the Committee on Immigra
tion.
A motion was made by Chandler (R. ) of
New Hampshire to submit the credentials
of Henry Heitfe-d, Senator-ftlect from
. Idaho, to the Committee on Privileges
and Elections, together with certain me
morials and proiests from Idaho against
nl. owing Mr. Heitfeld to taKe his seat on
account of alleged frauds in hia election.
This motion pave rise to numerous points
of order and considerable discussion, but
the rpotion was withdrawn without action
in order to resume the regular order â
consideration of private pension bills â
Hill (D.) of New York pleading for this,
saying that It was â¢ l m*T or never."
An oDstacle was struck in several vetoed
pension cn&es, the ground of disapproval
being that the proposed beneficiaries are
remarried widows.
Ailen (Pop.) of Nebraskt, in criticizing
the President's action, referred to the
President as the person who was repre
sented -jo gallantly by proxy during the
war, and who had referred to Union sol
diers as "coffee-coolers.' 1
F.efore aciion could be bad on the bills
the hour of 6 o'clock arrived, and accord
ing to previous agreement the Senate took
a recess until 8 o'clock.
The Senate resumed its session at 8 p. m.,
but in the absence of a quorum there was
.10 attempt to transact business. The
Senators who were present beguiled the
time in chatting with each other and the
crowds in the galleries sat waiting pa
tiently for the proceedings to begin.
Senator Kyle (Pod.) of South Dakota
made bit tirst appearance in the Senate
since his re-election and Sherman cele
brated his last night in the fcenaie by put
tine in nn early apuearance. Pugh(D. )
of Alabama, Hill (D.) of New York and
Palmer (D. ) of Llinois were others of the
retiring Senators who were not absentees.
It was just 9 o'clock when a quorum
was announced to be present. Hoar(R.)
of Massachusetts and Walthall (D.) of
Mississippi weie appointed by the Vice-
President visitors to the West Point Mili
tary Academy and Carter (R.) of Moniana
and Lindsay (,D.) of Kentucky to the
Annapolis Naval Academy.
A vote was taken on the bill vetoed by
the President granting a pension to
RacheJ Patton, and resulted: Ayes 38,
ncÂ«s 12. So the bill was passed over the
President's veto.
Cullom(R.)of Illinois announced that
he would forego iuriher attempt to pass
the anti-scalping bill, owing to the strain
under which Senators had been or late
and the certainty that the bill could not
pass without material amendment.
Quay (K.) of Pennsylvania having sev
eral times suggested the absence of a
quorum, thus necessitating a rollcaW. and
a quorum each time appearing, led Hoar
(R.) of Massachusetts to enter a vigorous
protest against his dilatory tactics.
"It was never intended." he said, "that
the rules should put it into the power Ol
one man to prevent eighty-nine men doing
business â one man who in some conceiv
able case might be under the influence of
liquor; and I think â "
Quayâ l desire to say to the Senator
from MasÃachuÂ»etts that if he intends to
intimate that I am under the influence of
liquor â
Hoarâ l make no such intimation, Mr.
President.
Quay â He n a lunatic or a iiar, and I will
not tolerate a suggestion of that sort from
the Senator from Massachusetts or any
one else. lam doing what lam doing in
the interest of ray constituents.
Hoar repeated liis disclaimer of any per
sonal allusion to Quay, to which the
Pennsylvania Senator replied with a re
mark, sotto voce, that the mere suggestion
was a "nithy one."
Quay then went on to say that when the
repeal of the Sherman law was pending in
the Senate dilatory tactics were em
ployed, and the Senate was powerless to
prevent it.
This reference to ancient history brought
Dubois (Sil. ) of Idaho to his feet with the
assertion that during that right he never
once called for a quorum when there was
a quorum ol Senators in their seats.
The final conference reports on the In
dian and the District of Columbia appro
priation bills were presented and
agreed to.
Then the Senate took up the bill for the
appointment of a labor eotnmisstoti. It
was debated by Senators Hawley, Sboup,
Perkins, Squire and Hoar. The latter de
ciared that he was heartily in favor of
some such commission as that proposed
by the bill, but the passage of the pending
bill would prove to the laboring classes to
be merely "apples of Sodom," and as soon
as they had plucked the fruit it would
turn to dust and ushes.
The debate dragged alone and at 2 a. m.
was still going on. The bill was then
passed, with an amendment providing for
a report by the commission within two
years.
A resolution offered by Allison was
agreed to providing that the standing and
â¢elect committees of the Senatf as now
constituted be continued until their suc
cessors are elected.
gDuring the evening the final report on
the naval, Indian and District of Colum
bia bills were agreed to. The presiding
officers of the two houses to-night signed
the postoffice and fortifications bills. The
army bill was approved 10-day, but up to
to-night no notice had been received of
the approval by the President of the agri
cultural bill.
In the final report on the sundry civil
bill the Senate recede? from its amend
ment increasing the approprmtior> for the
Omaha exposition from $200,000 to $275,
--000.
The appropriation of $1.~>0,000 for a new
I survey of the Nicaraguan canal remains.

I aeraed to, while that relative to Buite,
j Moiit., $30,000 for the site, is stricken out.

The final conference report on the sun

At 3:30 the Senate went into secret
executive session.
LAST SESS/0N OF THE HOUSE.
Much Unfinished Work Remains â The Im-
trig radon Bill Passed Over the
President's Veto.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 3.-The
galleries were well filled when the House
met at 10:30 o'clock to-day. Considering
the early hour this morning at which the
House took a recess (3:10 a. m), the attend
ance of members on thu floor was very
good.
A disagreeing conference report on the
Indian appropriation bi(l was presented.
Flynn (R.) of Oklahoma opposed the Sen
ate amendment, which detaches the 4,000,
--000 acres of land belonging to the Osnge
Indian reservation and transfers it to the
Indian Territory. He made an earnest
pica against dismembering the Territory
of Oklahoma, and read from the clerk's
desk a strong protest against the amend
ment which was adopted yesterday by
the Legislature of the Territory.
Mr. Curtis (R.) of Kansas, who de
fended the amendment, asserted that all
the leading chiefs of the Osage tribe
favored the transfer. They were attached
to Oklahoma without their consent, and
if made a part of the Indian Territory
would secure a measure of justice that is
denied them now by tl<e ci:izens of Okla
homa. He referred" specifically to several
cases of alleged injury to the Indians, and
declared with much earnestness that they
were being robbed by settlers along the
border.
Cannon (R.) of Illinois said that if there
was an organized hell on earl i it was
among " the five civilized tribes of the
Indian Territory. He expressed his
amazement at the insertion of the amend
ment and hoped that the House conferees
would be instructed to reject it
By a vote of 57 to 100 the House rejected
the report of the conference and a further
| conference was agreed to.
Cannon moved to suspend the rules and
1 nonconcur in all the Senate amendments
j to the general deficiency bill.
Mabon (K.) of Pennsylvania wanted the
i House to vote on the amendment making
j payment for the Bowman act judgments,
amounting to nearly $1,000,000. /
Wellington (R.) of Maryland made a
i forcible plea 'or the payment of these
j claims, due the loyal men of the South
for their contributions to me cause of the
Union.
Sayers (O.) of Texas antagonized the
payment of the claims, saying he had no
I confidence in them.
Cannon snid these claims, some of them
dating back before the war and some of
them purporting to be what they are not,
were trying to steal their..- way through
Congress in the closing hours of the ses
sion. If the House should refuse to adopt
bis motion; Mr. Cannon said in conclu
sion, a single point of order would throw
the bill into the committee of the wholeâ
"and then it will be more certainly tost
than the vilest sinner on the day of judg
ment." [Laughter.] â¢
The roilcali resulted, ayes 182, noei 75.
So the rules were suspended and the
House non-concurred in the Senate
amendments and conferees were ap
pointed. ; â  â¢
i Grout (R.); of Pennsylvania presented
the conference report on the District of
Columbia bill. The Senate made 135
amendments, increasing the total of. the
bill $1,658,916. Of these the conferees
have disposed of 105 amendments, rec
ommending thjit the- Senate recede from
amendments amounting to $728,670, and

TLe report was agreed to. The House ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 4, 1897.
insisted upon its disagreement to the
amendments still involved.
Danford (R.) of Ohio moved that the
House pass the immigration bill over the
veto of the President, and without dis
cussion the roll was called for a vote. The
jtnnonncement of the vote â ayes 193, noes*
37_ W as received with applause..
Partial agreement of the conferees on
the Indian appropriation bill was re
ported and agreed to and a further con
lerence ordered. The Senate receded
from its amendment to the Indian bill,
transferring the Osage Indian reservation
to the Indian Territory.
A final agreement of the conferees on
the postoffice bill was reported and -agreed
to. The bill carries a total of $95,623,338.
The conference report on the bill to
amend the tariff law so as to authorize the
sale of forfeited smoking opium to the
highest bidder was at: reed to.
A short recess was taken at 5 o'clock
and at its expiration Boutelle (R.) of
Maine reported a partial agreement of
conferees on the naval appropriation bill.
Fourteen of the twenty-eight amendments
made by the Senate were disposed of in
the report, but the conferees reported a
disagreement on the remaining amend
ments relating to the increases of the
navy proposed by the Senate and the re
duction of the price for armor piate from
$400 to $300 per ton. The report was
agreed to.
Hoptins (R.) of Illinois moved that the
House concur in the amendment limiting
the price to be paid for armor plates to
$300 a ton. It was agreed to tain a vote at
9 o'clock.
The House agreed to the conference re
port on the fortifications bill, disposing of
all amendments. The bill carries a total
appropriation of 19.517,143. The House
then, at it :40 o'clock, took a recess until
8:30 p. M.
Tne House reassembled at 8:30 o'clock
in the presence of galleries crowded
almost to suffocation with throngs of peo
ple curious or interested In the proceed
ings of the closing uour of Congress 1 , and
there was much disorder both in the
chamber aivi in the galleries. Speaker
Reed was lorced, in his efforts to secure
quiet and obedience to the rules, to re
quest the aergeaut-at-arms to enforce
tnem.
The House then by a vote of 131 to 52
concurred in the amendment to the naval
appropriation bill limiting the average
price of armor plate to $300 a ton.
Upon the announcement of this vote
P'outelle, chairman of the Committee on
Naval Affairs, stated that for hiiuselt lie
did not feel justified in further delaying
the work of Congress by insisting upon a
disagreement to the remaining amend
ments of the Senate â those providing for
the construction of three torpedo-boats
and a small practice yessal for the naval
academy. He therefore moved a recon
sideration of the vote by which the House
insisted on its disagreement, and asked a
further conference. This was agreed to.
He tnen moved that the House concur in
the Senate amendments, and this was
agreed to, and thus unexpectedly the na
val appropriation bill was completed,
ready for the approval of the President.
The third conference report on tiie In
dian appropriation bill was presented.
The conference had reached an agreement
on all items of difference Out two â the
paragraph authorizing the use of sectarian
contract Indian schools to the extent of

ing preference to certain settlers upon
mineral lands. The report was aerreed to.
The report of the conference on the Dis
trict of Columbia bill (final) ended con
sideration of this bill.

eral deficiency, ana the House at 10:20
took a recess until 11 o'clock to await the
action of the conferees on these bills.

RUSH TO THE CAPITOL
Thousands of Excursionists Clamor for an
Opportunity to Witness the Closing
Scenes.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 3-The
Capitol building was the central noint to
ward which thousands of excursionists
drifted to-night. Not one-twentieth of
the peopie who clamored for entrance to
the galleries were able to get in.
Political clubs in uniform and stragglers
of' all sorts and conditions pushed and
jammed each other in the halls and corri
dors. Everybody was moved by a desire
to see the two bouses of Congress in
session before the hour of dissolution
arrives.
In the Senate the galleries wera crowded
throughout the entire uigbt. Long after
midnight men stood in rows 100 deep,
patiently waiting the chance that would
permit them to peep in. The private gal
lery of the Senators was filled with a gay
throng during the wholo evening, and late
at night a large contingent of the diplo
matic corps appeared on the scene and re
mained some time, the ladies especially
appearing to enjoy the scenes.
The proceedings on the floor were not of
the most edifying character. While wait
ing for the reports of conference com
mittees members called up various meas
ures and urged their passags with as much
confidence in the final outcome as though
there was ample time for the passage of
the biils in the House and their approval
by the President. Perhaps not one in ten
of these measures will ever become laws,
even should they be rushed through the
house under a suspension of the rules.
For this reason much of the proceedings
of to-night resemble*! a moctery.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 3 âAn

this case being William P. Brawley on

brings meaner details of his escapade,
which is not connected with pecuniary

A GREAT CRISIS
HAS ARRIVED
The Powers Order Greece to
Evacuate Crete in Six
Days.
Many Believe That a Monster
European War Is Inevi
table Now
A Demonstration in Athens To-Day
Will Urge the King to Re
main Infl xible.
LONDON, Em, March 3.â A dispatch
from Canea, Crete, says that an engage
ment was fought last evening between
Bashi-Bazouks of two villages and tho
Greeks on the heights of Malaza, and
lasted two hours.
A dispatch from Athens says that the
representatives of the powers there who
last evening presented a note to the Greek
Government demanding the evacuation of
Crete by Greece now admit that their in
structions from their respective Govern
ments were to warn Greece in the most
serious terms that the powers had irre
vocably determined to resort to the most
forcible measures of compulsion unless
the Greek fleet and troops were withdrawn
in six days.
The dispatch also says that the Greek
commodore, Sachtouris, has started for
Crete on board the torpedo-boat Mikaeli.
The Post to-morrow will publish a dis
patch from Constantinople to a news
agency here, laying that the collective
note from the powers presented to the
Porte yesterday mentions the gradual
withdrawal of the Turkish troops from the
island of Crete, and suggests a military
convention between the powers and the
Porte for the settlement of details.
The dispatch also says that negotiations
are proceeding; between the powers' repre
sentatives and the Porte regarding the
appointment of a governor for Crete, who,
it is said at the Porte, shall be a Turkish
subject.
The Daily Chronicle will to-morrow
publish a dispatch from Athens saying
that the content* of the joint note ad
dressed by the powers to Greece have
caused a solemn realization of the critical
moment which has arrived. Toe palace
square, the dispatch says, is constantly
crowded with groups discussing the situa
tion. Tnc people are absolutely unan
imous and everybody seems to have per
fect confidence in the King's firmness.
On all sides are heard declarations that if
the King should order the withdrawal of
the Greek troops from Crete Colonel Vas
sos, who commands the army of occupa
tion, alone would return and that all the
other officers would join the forces of the
insurgents.
A great demonstration, the dispatch
states, has been arranged for March 4 to
u7_e the King to remain inflexible in the
stand he has taken.
It is recognised here that the situation
with reference to Crete is Decoming ex
tremely grave, end there are many who
believe that affairs have alrendy\ pro
gressed so far as to make a great European
war in the near future inevitable. The
action of the powers has por>tponÂ«d the
crisis for a few days, and it is hoped that
within that time something of a more
pereeful character will take place.
The note sent to Athens requested
Greece to withdraw its forces from Crete
within six days, and was accompanied
with hints that a refusal would not be
tolerated.
The general opinion is that Greece will
refuse to do as requested and that when
the time has expired a more peremptory
note demanding immediate compliance
will be sent. This it is also believed that
Greece will refuse to notice.
Then if the powers attempt to enforce it
Greece will declare war against Turkey
and will transfer the scene of hostilities to
the borders of the two countiie?.
What will happen then cannot be pre
dicted. It is known that the connection
between the great powers is of a very
slender character, and that but little force
would be needed to break it. Here in
England there is a very strong sentiment
in favor of Greece and in favor of the an
nexation of Crete to that country. Should
a rupture among the powers occur it
would not be a surprising matter if Eng
land bacKed up Greece. Should it decide
to do so, it will be in readiness to eive ef
fective help, for work in the various dock
yards is proceeding with feverish rapidity,
and a great fleet of warships will very soon
be ready for business.
A dispatch from Athens says that Com
modore Reinick, commanding the Greek
warship Hydra, who, in reply to a de
mand by the foreign admirals at Canea
that the Greek warships withdraw from
Cretan waters, declared that be would
only obey the orders of his own (iovern
mpiit, has been recalled for his failure to
fire upon the Turkish warship Faud when
that vessel joined with the foreign war
ships in the bombardment of the Cretan
Christians.
A dispatch from Athens to the Central
News says that the Greek Metropolitan
has telegraphed to the Archbishop of
Canterbury invoking the support of the
Anglican church for the Greek cause.
The Standara will to-morrow publish a
dispatch from Constantinople paying that
the Sultan has issued an order directing
that the 72,000 troops already mobilized
be increased to a total of 170,000.

WJLXT TUtS AIC RAOVA. CAS Ah.
President Zelava OiÂ»Â«Â« n Gentle Bint to
Unel* Sam.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 3.â The
President to-day sent to the Senate copies
of tne correspondence or official commu
nications relating to the Nicaragnan canal
since 1887 with the Government of Nicar
agua, or any Minister thereof, between the
Government of the United States and its
Ministers accredited to the Government of
Nicaragua.
The most important communication,
perhaps, is a note from Minister Baker to
Secretary Olney, under date of February
3, 1896, inwnich, at a conference held with
President Zslayn of NiCHragna, tdat. offi
cial is quoted assaying the Government
bad taken the opinion of a committee of
three of tneir ablest lawyers as to whether
the canal company had forfeited their
rignts by noi having done auy work for
many years, and aiter a most careful ex
amination of the question in all its bear
ings the committee came to the conclusion
that the company had broken its contract
withtbe Government.
"But," added the President, "we will
not throw any obstacle in the way of the
company if it will in good faith try to
raise the money and go on with the work.
If, however, the company continues inac

TO CALIFORNIA
San Pedro's Friends Exult
Over Their Victory at
Washington.
Leading Men of Los Angeles Say
It Gives an Impetus to
Business.
Confident That the Railway From
Salt Lake Will Now Be
Constructed.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 3.â The
magnitude of yesterday's victory in be
half of California's people as against a
powerful corporation in the matter of tbe
deep-water harbor decision is beginning
to be realized. After yesterday's delirium
of delight a sober second thought pos
sesses the mind 3 of the populace, and
they foresee tbe benefits that will accrue
from the commission's act. The decision
has given an impetus to business here un
known before for years.
The Call has been the recipient of
man; eulopiums here to-day from those
i. have been active in the late battle
.1 in behalf of the people's harbor.
They declare thai. The Call's course has
been consiitent from the start and there
fore of inestimable value in the contest
just closed. One incident is especially
noteworthy in this connection and has
been the subject of comment as well as
praise from all sides. It is the fact that
without display of trumpets or claim to
extraordinary foresight it was the first
newspaper on the coast to name the win
ning site, San Pedro, even designating
the one Commissioner (Morgan) who
would refuse to sign tbe report with the
others. This was the first and only tangi
ble information published on the subject
prior to the public and general press an
nouncement of yesterday.
The Call published on tbe morning of
February 25 substantially all that has
been vouchsafed since upon the sub
ject, viz.: that San Pedro had won the
Lar.bor fight, and that the result had been
accomplished by the concurrent agree
ment of four members out of a total of
;.ve, Morgan favoring Santa Monica.
Hon. T. E. Gibbon, vice-president of the
Terminal Railway Company, referring to
this bit of good news in The Call, which
antedated by several days the same in
formation in its contemporaries, said:
' Ihe Call has just reasons for being
â proua ot iis record in this harbor matter,
lor it was to my certain knowledge the
r.r-r newspaper which came under my ob
servation to name the site for the deep
water harbor."
The ssme sentiments were expressed by
pz- Mayor W. H. Workman, Hon. J. F.
Humphreys and a score of others.
A number of business enterprises have
been *-et on foot at Sun .Pedro as a result
of this decision. Next Tuesday the local
officers of the Terminal Railway Company
wil! conduct an excursion to San Pedro in
.donor of, and as an expression of grati
> (â _â . tne three commercial bodies of
V this cityâ the Board of Trade, the Charo
-1 ber of Commerce and the Merchants' and
" Manufacturers' Association.
Leading citizens who were seen this aft
ernoon gave the following expressions of
their sentiments:
Mayor Snyder â The people of Los An
geles are to be congratulated that the j
ereat appropriation of $3,000,000 is avail
able at last for a harbor in thi3 vicinity.
San Pedro should matte an ideal harbor.
Charles Dwight Willard, secretary of
the Chamber of Commerce â This is a great â¢
event in the history of Los Angeles. Such !
results come once in a lifetime. A great
victory has been achieved for the people
and a free harbor against individual in
terest. We are proud to be on the win
rilng siae, on the side tiiat firmly and con-
Bistintiy stayed with the struggle from j
the beginning, seven years ago. It means I
everything for Los Angeles.
W. C. Furry, of the Furry Hardware !
Company â This city is the business center
of this southern country, and will necces
sarily reaD all the benefits to be derived
from a deep-water harbor. There is no
doubt whatever about the Salt Lake road
being built. It will pass through a rich
mining country, and will direct business
to our doors.
Major Kiokke â I am glad to think that
it is all ended ; glad it was decided for San
Pedro four to one. I hope work will begin
at once.
Chief, of Police Glass â I have always
been in*favor of San Pedro, and think that
the decision will do a great deal for the
city. With the harbor and tbe proposed
Halt Lake Railroad, Los Angeles and this
entire section will experience aucb a boom
as has never before been known. Let the
work be hurried along as fast as possible.
President H. W. Frank of the Mer
chants' and Manufacturers' Association â
I am highly gratified at the result of the
' harbor commissioners' decision, and feel
that prosperity cannot be a stranger to
our section when this great work is com
plcteJ. San Pedro is the natural site for
a deep-sea harbor, and the commissioners
iiave but seen the matter In the same
lir;ht as those of us who have lived here
!r years and Know that the right spot
as at last been selected,
councilman E. L. Hutchinsonâ The de
... on of the commission is a great victory
for the people. Now if Congress will only
tsKe the matter up andstart work as soon
as possible, letting thecontracts if possi
ble in Southern California, it will furnish
employment for thousands of men who
badly need work. Times will improve at
once and this section will experience an
era of progress such as has never been seen
opre before.
President George H. Bonebrake of the
Los Angeles National Bank â It means the
expenditure of the immense appropria
tion made by Conpress. It will be a splen
did thin<? for tbe business interests of this
city. I have no doubi whatever about the
building of the Salt Lake road. The selec
tion of San Pedro for the harbor maybe
the means of connecting the Terminal
road with the San Joaquin Valley road.
The heavy owners of the terminal road
reside in the East, are men of influence
and are right in tbe center of the financial
circle. A deep-water harbor will attract
EhippiDg to this southern coast and it will
greatly stimulate business in this section.
The benefits that will be derived from
this great enterprise cannot be overesti
mated.
Hon. J. F. Humphreys â I always
thought it would go to San Pedro, as that
.is the natural place for a harbor. I
worked for ii, and am delighted to know
the matter has been settled. The impor
tance of this public improvement cannot
be overestimated. It will have a tendency
to dnect capitalists in this direction, and
frill have an important bearing on all our
material interests. The mero announce
ent that the harbor matter has been
ttled will draw the attention of wealthy
men on the outside to this section. It
will boost along the building of the pro
' posed road to Salt Lake, which will form
the eastern outlet for the terminal road.
Ex-Mayor Workmanâ The biggest thing
in the history of the city. It marks a new
era in the prosperity and progress of Los
Angeles. Thf> Salt Lake road will follow
as a natural sequence.
Hiabop Montgomeryâ lt is a great thing
for Southern California. The expenditure
of $3,000,000 or any part of it in tnis sec
tion at this time will result in uniold pood.
"The terminal road, 1 said Vice-Presi
dent Gibbon, "was built originally to af
ford facilities to Los Angeles and open
the future d^ep-water harbor of Los An
gelea at San Pedro to a line of transconti
nental road which the projectors of the
terminal believe would be constructed
from Salt Lsko to this city. The five-year
delay in the definite location of the har
bor,'which was caused by the opposition
at once arising upon its becomme ap
parent that the construction at ban Pedro
would attract another transcontinental
road, caused the postponement of the
building of tbe new line. Now that the
harbor matter is definitely settled in favor
of Sen Pedro, where it will be free to com
peting lines of railway, it would appear
that the Salt Lake project would very
shortly materialize."
President of the Council Herman Silver
Like every other good citizen lam glad
that the harbor question is bottled. I
think that the commission acted wisely,
and its decision will be generally in
dorsed.
General Charles Formanâ lt is a ereat
thing for the city. While I always
thouerbt the decision would be for San
Pedro. I am glad that it is settled and I
hope that actual work will Legin in the
near future.
Councilmun Nickell â We should all be
glad that the question is settled. It is
worth millions to Soutnern California and
will be a great factor in our luture
progress*.
Councilman Ashmanâ l was always a
San Pedro man and am glad that my
judgment has received such a big indorse
ment.
Councilman Tollâ l don't see how it
could have been otherwise. Of course I
am glad that the question is settled.
Councilman Mathnss â I favored San
Pedro first, last and all the time. The re
port is a matter for general congratula
tion.
THE VOLCANO IN THE LAKE.
Sinking Natural Phenomenon in Great
Salt Lake Confirmed by a Farmer
Hho Saw />.
SALT LAKE, Utah, March 3.âEviden
ces that Borne very striking natural
phenomena are at work in the great Salt
Lake a few miles west of Brighom City,
continue to appear. A Herald special from
Brigham City, received late this evening,
says that Martin Rhauer, an old citizen
residing near Corinne and close to the
shore of the lake, confiinrt the reports of
the recent volcanic disturbances in the
island sea.
In fact, he not only confirms the first
story sent out to The Call, but adds to it
the startling intelligence that the eruption,
or upheaval, is not a geyser, but a volcano,
as at first reported, from which smoke
and possibly fire ascends. He claims to
have seen the smoke arising, an.l locates
the scene about four miles southwest of
Corinne, a station in Utah on the Central
Pacific Railroad.
He says large volumes of smoke are
emitted/but that the volcano setms to be
particularly active in the forenoon or a
few hours previous to sunset. This may
be due to the fact that tbe smoke is at
that time in front of the sun.
Mr. Khauer, however, not only con
firms the existence of the first upheaval
reported, which he says he believes has
formed a cone or mound, but also reports
that be has discovered another upheaval a
short distance away.
The Great Salt Lake has fallen several
feet within the last three years, and the
water between the Brigbam City shore
and the island is very shallow compara
tively at present, so that it would not re
quire much sediment to form a mound,
A Call representative will join another
expedition to the lake to make an investi
gation.
SECRET COXCL i Y ES AT STOCKTOS.
Mystery Surround* tne Doing* of the A.
i*. A. Convention*.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 3.â The sec
ond day of the conventions in this city of
the A. P. A. and the W. A. P. A. was
characterized by the same secrecy as was
observed on the opening day. The dele
gates actually go as far as to say that the
convention is going on, but that is the
extent of the communicativeness on the
subject.
State President Hndelson waÂ« asked at
the noon recess to-day whether the elec
tion of officers would take place to-day,
and he replied that it would very proba
b!v not. He said that the names of the
officers would be given to the p:ess when
they were elected. When asked whether
there was any business done to-day that
might be made public ho replied nega
tively.
The session reconvened this afternoon
and the delegates were still working in
Becret.
Last evening an entertainment was
given by the women delegates to their
brothers of the A. P. A., but it was as se
cret as the sessions, and not even the
members of tbe local councils were in
vited, which has caused some feeling
among the latter.

STOCKTON. Cal., March 3.â The fol

here.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 4, 1897.
TACOMA BROKER
FATALLY SHOT
G. M. Bearce Got the Worst
of a County Warrant
Quarrel.
0. S. Robinson Took H mself
and His Pistol to the Police
Station.
The Trouble Said to Date Back Two
Tears Concsmin; Other Fiaan*
cial Dealings.
TACOMA, Wash., March 3âo. S. Rob
inson, a former clerk in the office of the
County Auditor, this morning shot and
probably fatally wounded George M.
Bearce in the latter's office in the Gross
block.
Bearce is a broker in warrants, and tbe
trouble between them arose regarding
some claims they had purchased against
the county, although, accordinz to Robin
son, the true cause of the trouble is busi
ness dealings, which dated back for two
years.
Immediately after the shooting Robin
son went to the police station and gave
himself up, while Bearce was taken to
Fannie Paddock Hospital, where an un
successful effort was made to locate the
bullet. To-morrow another attempt will
be made. It entered his upper lip, crashed
through the facial bones and is imbedded
somewhere between the roof of his mouth
and his brain. *
Their claims against tbe county bad
been shaved down $25, and each wanted
the other to stand the loss. Robinson
claims Bearce made a lunge at him when
he, in turn, fired in selt-defense. Bad
feeling existed previously over an invest
ment of about $2000 made by Bearce for
Robinsoc, to whom money had been sent
by a friend in New York. The friend
wanted a settlement some time ago, but
Robinson claims Bearce still retains about
$500. This has caused the former much
worriment, and lately be has been treated
by a physician for melancholia, which
rendered him unfit for business.
When Robinson appeared at the police
station he was in a state of almost total
collapse. For several minutes he could
not control himself sufficiently to make
known his identity. Mrs. Robinson was
sent for, and immediately summoned a
physician. Robinson lost an arm years
ago in railroad service. He was once
chief c!erk at the wharf for the Northern
Pacific Railroad, but was let out during
the strike three years ago. He has al
ways been popular among his acquaint
ances. Bearce has bad trouble over finan
cial matters before and is considered very
aggressive in his business dealings.
V UNA'S GOLD EXCITEMENT.
Tales of Fabulous Strikes Cause a Bush
of Prospectors to the Moun
tains.
YUMA, Ariz., March 3 âThe excite
mintoccasioned here by fabulous strikes
in the mountains seventy-five miles north
east of Yuma is increasing daily and
scenes enacted in tbe early days of Cali
fornia may be repeated. None of the ore
brought in from the rich strikes runs less
than $2000 to the ton, and much of it goes
a great deal higher. A store has been
opened at the place and a stage line es
tablished at Sentinel, a point on tbe rail
road nearest to the scene, for the accom
modation of the excited men who are
rushing to get some of the valuable
ground.
The efforts of the discoverers to keep
the location secret were frustrated by a
prospector named Kane. He was at Gila
City, fifteen miles east of here, when the
discoverer, Edward Eichelberg, returned
from Yuma with mining expert Frank
Guerra, He started on their trail,
mounted on a burro and with nothing to
eat but a box of sardines and a can of
corned beef; but he followed their waeon
tracks for forty miles through the hills,
arriving in the middle of the night, foot
sore and hungry.
The following morning Kane discovered
and located some claims which prospect
well up into the thousands. Then he pre
pared to return, only to find that his burro
had deserted. He was compelled to walk
the entire distance back and was for two
days without food.
IRRIGATION 1M ARIZONA.
Work Jitgun on a Canal That Will Make
the Desert Itlootn.
YUMA, Abiz., March 3. â A company
has been formed and has begun work on
tbe Gravity Canal in the Lower Colorado
Valley, fifteen miles below Yuma, which
will turn the waters of tbe Colorado River
on 8000 acres of rich land for which Yuma
County Is beginning to become famous. It
is tbe first to be consummated of half a
dozen enterprises of like character, though
all of greater magnitude, which have been
hanging tire in this section for many years.
Owing to tbe fact that a large portion of
tbe richest land in tbe county has been in
volved in litigation between the Govern
ment and parties claiming it as a grant
from the Mexican Government, the imme
diate prospect of a settlement of the ca?e
is turning the tide and several monster ir
rigation enterprises will soon go through.

PORT TOWNSEND MOURNS.
Dea'h of Hon. Charles HI. Bradshaw,
Prominent as Pionetr and
Politician.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., March 3 â
Hon. Charles M. Bradshaw, one of the
most prominent and highly respected pio
neers of this section, died last evening
at his home in this city after a lingering
illness from Bright's disease.
Bradshaw was born in Pennsylvania in
1831, and twenty years later came across
the plains to Washington, locating first at
what is now known as Dungeness, and
later at Port Townsend, where he had
since resided. He was the first represen
tative from this county in the Territorial
Council. In 1886 he was the Repubiican
candidate for delegate to Congress, but
was defeated through the workings of
women's suffrage, which was at that time
undergoing its initial experiment in this
State.
In 1889 Bradshaw was appointed Col
lector of Customs for the Pucet Sound dis
trict. His incumbency was tbe most sen
sational in the history of the district,
scandal following scandal in. rapid suc
cession, most of the trouble being occa
sioned by dishonest and careless officers
in the service. The climax came in 1891,
when Bradshaw resigned and was suc
ceeded by Andrew Wasson, at that time
a new arrival in the State. Immediately
after relieving him-ell of the cares and
worries of public life, Bradsbaw was at
tacked by an illness which (or seven years
struggled to gain a victory over his vigor
ous constitution and remark able vitality.
ABERDEEN DEPOT MOBBED.
Masked Bandit Fell* the Agent With a
(luh and Hobs the Safe.
TACOMA, Wash., March 3.â A. C. Clark,
station agent of the Northern Pacific at
Aberdeen, was discovered by the baggage
man lying on the floor in the depot at 3:15
yesterday afternoon, with an ugly wound
on his head, from which the blood had
run out over the floor.
Shortly before 3 o'clock, while he was at
work at his desk, a lar^e, heavy-set man
came in, with a mask over his face and,
when Clark looked up, struck him over
the bead with a club, rendering him un
conscious.
He then took tbe day's freight and pas
senger receipts and the private money of
Clark's out of the safe, the whole amount
ing to about $500.
A man answering the description given
by Clark had been hanging around the
town several days. T c Sheriff is out
with a posse and the robber cannot get
out of the country unless he walks out
over some of the bark country roads.
Clark's injuries will not prove serious.
He is 46 years of age, has a large family,
and has been agent at Aberdeen for six
years.
WASHIHGTOA FOREST RESERVES.

SEATTLE, Wafh., March 3.â Much in

W. Atkinson of the Aivarado Beet Sugar
Refinery was in town making contracts
with the farmers in this vicinity for rais
in v sugar beets. The factory will pay
$3 40 a ton, while the prevailing price last
year was but $3. About 600 acres will be
cultivated. Mr. Atkinson states that ex
cepting Chino and Watsonville the bean
raised here last season contained a greater
percentage of sugar than tho3e raised in
other counties. Atkinson says that if the

tariff put on sugar the beets will be worth
ut least $4 per ton next season.

in tbe Good Hope for about six weeks.
Fresno W inert/'* Xeto Method*.
FRESNO, Cal., March 2.â The Cali
fornia Wine Association will soon begin the
construction of a $10,000 addition to its big
winery and distillery south of town. It is

stead of running the grapes up an eleva
tor and crushing them they will be crushed
on tbe ground floor and the must pumped

TURLOCK'S BONDS
HAVE BEEN SOLD
Noy7 No Further Bar to
Irrigation Around
Modesto.
San Francisco Syndicate's Bid
at 90 Cents on the Dollar
Accepted.
Completion of the Systems in Stan
islaus County Will Now
Be Hastened.
MODESTO, Cal., March 3.â The Tur
lock Irrigation District's bonds have been
sold and now there is nothing standing in
the way of completing thÂ« irrigating sys
tem and running water upon the lands of
the district. The new board of directors,
recently elected, met yesterday at Turlock
for the first lime.
The principal business was opening the
sealed bids for the remaining bonds of the
district, amounting to $472,500. There
were two bids presented, one from Gen
eral W. H. H. Hart, which provided for
the purchase of bonds as the progress of
work required, the other from Robert A.
Friedrich, representing a San Francisco
syndicate of wealthy men. It bid for the
bonds at 00 cents on the dollar, uncon
ditioned. The latter bid was accepted
and the news soon spread throughout the
country that the sale of the bonds, so long
delayed, had at last been made.
Judge Waymire of San Francisco ad
dressed the board at length. He entered
into a contract some time a^o to finish the
district's system for these same bonds,
but when the Supreme Court handed
down the decision known as the Hughson
vs. Crane deci3.on, it practically pre
cluded the idea of ins taking the bonds as
pay, because this decision was to the
effect that no Donds could be exchanged
for work, but must be advertised and sold
accoraing to law.
The new board of directors announced
their intention of proceeding with the
work, and the general supposition is that
Judge Wayniire will push the work of th 6
district immediately. He now has a small
force of men tunneling near Big Dam.
In Modesto irrigation district the new
board of directors met, organized and
tiansacted routine business. As with the
Turlcclc board, the Modesto directors ex
pressed a desire to immediately proceed
with the completion of the system, al
though part of tne board were formerly
the most active anti-irrigators in the dis
trict. After appointing an attorney for
the district they gave him explicit in
structions regarding any further district
litigation. Heretofore the first thing done
by counsel in litigations has been to file
demurrers, ask for continuances and make
all other kinds of delays known to the legal
prof ssion.
The board adopted a resolution aimed
at all these delays. Hereafter when suit
is brought against the district the attor
ney of the district will be expected to im
mediately prepare an answer to the com
plaint and force the case to trial on its
merits, without allowing th* heretofore
long-winded technical objections. Had
this proceeding been established many
years ago litigation would have long since
been ended and the full legal status of tne
districts been fully and definitely deter
mined. The resolution reads:
Resolved, That it be the sense of this board
thai no continuance be granted in pending
litigation, ana ttiat all cases wherein the in
terests of the district are affected they be
prosecuted as speedily as possible.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
THURSDAY MARCH 4. 1897
â¢ During the week ending Sat-
urday last THE CALL published
4429 inches
of advertisements, which is
Q X Q inches more
than was published by any other
San Francisco newspaper during
the same time.
Hail President McKinley.
Hurrah for Prosperity Bill.
To-day the Republic rejoices.
Good-by, old Grover, good-by.
It is the inauguration of a new era.
Now for an American administration in
all things.
Democracy has lost its incubus, and
rejoices with ths rest.
Debt, deficit, depression and disaster
will soon be things ol the past.
It is hard to tell whether Cleveland feels
eicker over his gout or his go out.
In going- into retirement Mr. Cleveland
â will for once be the right man for the
place.
For this forenoon Cleveland is still
President, but oh, what a difference in the
morning.
The wine with which Los Angeles will !
cheer herself for the new era will be her j
new port.
Â» â 
"Where Cleveland tore down McKinley i
will build up. Aiter the destruction comes
the reconstruction.
Canton will now resume its former posi
tion as a way station and cease to be a
political Etorm center.
Now as for the venerable mother of
McKinley, all the people in the country
Will rise up to do her honor.
McKlnley's inaugural address will be
awaited with eagerness, but not with
anxiety. The people know him.
â¢
As a matter of fact this ought to be a
public holiday, for the people have rarely i
felt co much like making a jaDiiee as they
do now.
Let us push the demand for immediate I
wort on the Federal building. Let us be
among the first to start the enterprises of
the new era.
The bill providing the payment of the
Southern Pacific ciaim of $1,310,427 has
been defeated in the Senate. Mr. Hunt
injrton will attend the inaugural with a
black eye.
Cleveland's veto of the immigration bill
was his iast lick at the prosperity of the
country, but, fortunately, we shall soon
have an extra session of Congress and can
pass the bill again.
With the coming of McKinley capital
will have its protection, labor its oppor
tunity, industry its reward, and confi
dence long banished lrom the couutry
will return at once.
"With a strong, cheerful, sanguine, pa
triotic man at the head of affairs we shall
coon have a better feeling among the peo
ple, and business will go forward with
confidence and enterprise.
After the Democrat comes the Republi
can, after the free-trader comes the pro
tectionist, after the egotist comes the
patriot, after the blunderer comes the
statesman, and after the depression comes
good times.
Every throb of joy at Washington to
day will be responded to tbroughout the
country, and the people everywhere will
be in sympathy with the joyous thou
sands who cheer the arrival of the ad
vance agent of prosperity.
Don't forget to attend the mass-meeting
at the Chamber of Commerce to inaugu
rate the movement for speeding the work
on the new Federal building. Ii will be
San Francisco's way of celebrating the in
coming of the new administration.
The Call was the first to announce that
Ihe Government Commission would ren
der an award in favor of San Pedro harbor,
and the official report published yester
day confirms our announcement in every
detail. It is always so. There are never
any fakes in The Call.
There will be hardly even as much ai a
serious factional antagonism to the Me-
Kinley administration in tbe next Con
gress. An era of good feeling has re
turned, as it was in the pleasant days of
President Monroe, and the pc Â»ple can
look forward to a period of rest from po
litical agitations and disturbances of our
economic and industrial system.
Hvnton Rowan Helper, whose book,
â¢â¢The Impending Crisis," was one of the
sensations of the anti-slavery contest, is
still living and ha 9 written a letter to the
> T ew York Times declaring that Senator
Sherman bai entered "deeply into tbe de
plorable dotage of dangerous deficiency."
He meant merely that the Senator is too
old to be a good Secretary of Slate, but
the pnrase sounds as if he desired to wipe
the Ohio man off the earth.
PRESIDENT McKINLEY.
The accession to office of President McKinley will mean something more to the
people of the United States than a mere change of administration, or even a change
in governmental policy. It will mean a change in the personal influence of the chief
executive of the Republic, and that is of more importance than is generally sup
posed.
The influence of the personal character of a ganeral upon the temoeramant of an
army is well Known. It has been a proverb ever since the day of iEsop that an army
of hares commanded by a lion would overcome an army of lions commanded bf a
hare. It has not been so generally noted, but it is none the less true, that a people is
largely affected by the personal characteristics of its chief executive. With a strong,
confident, cheerful man at the forefront of a nation, all business, eren of a private
nature, is conducted more vigorously and more confidently than when the high office
is occupied by a man of less sanguine character.
Grover Cleveland has been a pessimist in his views of the economic conditions of
the country. He has regarded our industrial system as radically wrong. He has
spoten of onr great corporations as a "communism of pelf." In all his messages to
Congress he has a-sailed the existing order of things and has disturbed the people by
nis incessant agitations for a chance. He has denounced not only the tariff, out the
currency, and has as seriously disturbed the financial as the industrial world. As a
result of his "pernicious activity" he has produced during his term of office an inces
sant strife between labor and capital, between debtor and creditor, and has injuri
ously affected the welfare of every class of people.
President McKinley differs from Mr. Cleveland not only in his politics but in per
sonal characteristics. He is not a pessimist, but an optimist. He regards our in
dustrial system as right and not wrong. He believes the interests of labor and capital
are identical. He holds that the welfare of debtors and creditors can be subserved by
the same measure*. He has faith in the destinies of America. He nas confidence in
the Impulses of its people. He trusts in the common sense of his fellow-citizens.
His influence, therefore, will tend to promote a more cheerful and a more harmonious
feeling among all classes of Americans, and, as a result, will have a beneficial effect
not only upon public affairs but upon private interests.
The contrast between the two men was shown eariy in life by the attitude which
they assumed toward the Nation in its period of civil war. Cleveland, indifferent to
the country, sent a substitute to ihe army when he was drafted for service. McKinley,
without waiting to be drafted, volunteered among the earliest to fight for the preser
vation of the Union. The dfferent characteristics thus displayed have grown stronger
in each man with advancing age. Cleveland has never been a patriot. McKinley is
pre-eminently a patriot above everything else. He is a man who so loves his country
that he is willing to fight for it, and has so much confidence in its usefulness to the
world that if need be he would give his life for it.
The American people may well rejoice on the day which sees the change from the
pessimist to the optimist, from the disturber to the harmonizer, from the egotist to
the patriot in the high office of the Presidency. We have much to expect from the
change in the administration and from the change in policy, but when all has been
accounted for it will be found that the chief benefit which the American people will
receive from the inauguration to-day will be the removal of the influence upon public
life of Grover Cleveland and the substitution of that of the soldier statesman, William
McKinley.
THE MASS-MEETING.
The mass-meeting which will be held at
the Chamber of Commerce to-day for the
purpose of requestine our Senators and
Representatives in Congress to urge the
United States Government officials to im
mediately issue orders for the con
struction of the new Federal building in
this City is one which has a rightful
claim upon the attention of every public
spirited citizen. The object is important
and it is imperative that it should be
strongly supported here, in order that the
desired end may be accomplished.
The Call began a new agitation on this
subject c short time ago, because it recog
nized the importance of prompt action at
this juncture. It is known that the delay
in the construction of the work has been
due partly to the action of a newspaper in
this City, which opposed the construction
of the building, and partly to the determi
nation of the Cleveland administration
not to carry on any public work which it
could avoid. At the present time boih
these obstacles to success have ceased to
be of any great potency. The newspaper
which opposed the building is now com
pelled to resort to indirection in conduct
ing its warfare. It no longer dares to di
rectly antagonize it. The administration
of delay and deficit goes out of office to
day. The people are united and a new
administration comes into power. If,
therefore, we act with due vigor at home
and induce our delegates in Congress to
act with equal vigor in Washington we
can be reasonably sure of immediate suc
cess.
The importance of the wort cannot be
denied by any one. There are many in
dustrious men belongins to the building
trades who are out of work and who would
find employment if the proposed building
were began. There is need also for an in
creased activity In business, which would
bo brought about by the circulation of
money expended by the Government in
the construction of the building. There is
the further fact that such an edifice is
needed by the Government officials in this
City for offices. Ail these things taken
together constitute a strong reason why
the construction of the building should be
speedily undertaken, and it is reasonably
certain that if prurer representations are
made to the official* of the new adminis
tration the work will begin witfcout fur
ther unnecessary delay.
This being the situation of affairs, it
seems hardly necessary that any urging
should be needed to bring out a large at
tendar.ca at the proposed mass-meeting.
The movement begun by The I'all is
supported by the State Board of Trade,
the Supervisors and the Mayor, the Cham
ber of Commerce, the Labor Council and
all men of public spirit in the City.
Under such leadership no citizen should
hesitate in co-operating with the work.
Let us nave a grand mass-meeting to-day
and inaugurate in San Francisco a move
ment which will put us into perfect har
mony and make us sharers in the work of
the new administration which is to be in
augurated simultaneously at Washington.
THE MONOPOLY BEATEN.
The announcement made exclusively by
The Call some days ago that the Govern
ment commission appointed to select a
site for a deep-water harbor in Southern
California would give its drcision in favor
of San Pedro was confirmed by the official
report, which wns published yesterday.
This confirmation is another evidence that
The Call never publishes fakes. It asserts
nothing positively which it has not inves
tigated. When it reports a thing as true
the public can rely upon it.
Notwithstanding the announcement pre
viously made by Tns Call the pubiic was
well pleased yesterday to receive official
confirmation ol the success of the people
in the struggle with the monopoly. A
deep-water harbor at San Pedro will be a
benefit to all California. The immediate
gain from the money expended in the
construction of the work will be great,
but far more valuable will be the gain de
rived from a good harbor opposite Los
Angeles free from monopoly control and
open to the commerce of th- whole coast,
of the Orient and of the islands of Aus
tralasia. California has, therefore, good
reason to rejoice in the award of the Com
missioners and may riehtiy look forward
to immediate and far-reaching beneficial
results from it.
The decision given by the Government
commission in favor of the harbor at San
Pedro was not the, only defeat of the
Southern Pacific Company announced
yesterday. It will be remembered that
when the claim of the Southern Pacific
for $1,310,427 was approved by the House
of Representative* and a sum appropriated
for its payment The Call predicted the
claim would be defeated in the Senate.
This prediction was also continued by the
dispatches yesterday. The Senate adopted
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 4, 1897.
an amendment to the bill providing that
the money appropriated for the claim
should be turned into the United States
treasury and held there until the settle
ment of the claim of tin Government
against the Pacific roads.
This was another triumph of the people
over the once all-powerful monopoly.
Taten with the emancipation of the
whole of the Ban Joaquin Valley from
monopoly freight rates by reason of the
construction of the competing rond, these
two successes may be fairly considered as
the be inning of the end of the Southern
Pacific's domination in California. We
are now on a right road to commercial
and industrial freedom, and have only to
persevere in order to obtain a complete
triumph. Let the people remain united,
harmonious and resolute, and the new era,
which dawns to-day witn tiie inauguration
of the McKinley administration, will be a
most prosperous one for California in
evtry sense of the word.
THE BUILDING TRADES.
The Call publish d yesterday a review
of the condition of the building trade in
this City, which shown that, while the
present condition is not altogether satis
factory, the prospects for better things
are bright. It did not, of course, give a
full statement of all the work of construc
tion now under way, for much of it is in
private hands, and therefore not available
for publication. Enough was shown,
however, to make it evident that while
the construction of baildings is not so
active now as it has been in the past, yet
there are evidences that a large increase
will be seen in the near future.
According to a table just completed by
the Building Review ol Ban Francisco the
most prosperous year at this season for
building in San Francisco was 1891, when
during January and February 210 edifices
were erected at a total cost of |1,777,636.
The record for the first two months o; this
year is only $012,535. This is a tremen
dous falling off and shows the effect of
the depression brought about by the free
trade Congress and the Cleveland admin
istration. If it stood alone there would be
reason for discouragement among work
ingmen who are engaped in building, but
fortunately there is ample reason for be
lieving that a change is at hand, and that
with the incoming of the new administra
tion there is to be a new era in building
as well as in other industries, and that
before t>>e year closes there will be an
abundance of wort for all who need it.
Among the new structures which we
may expect to be undertaken in a com
paratively short time are t c Hall of Jus
tice, Am iated Colleges, the Mission Hirh
School, the Menlo Park Academy of the
Sacred Heart, and the new Federal build
ing. In addition to these there will of
course bj a large number of homes, stores,
offices and shops of various kinds erected
by private parties. The ferry depot and
the great Spreckels building will continue
to employ many men for some time to
come, and when these are completed there
will be others begun to givo work to those
who have been engaged on those struc
tures.
In an interview published in The Call
yesterday Vice-President Butcher of the
Builders' Exchange expressed himself as
decidedly hopeful of the outlook. "There
are many private and public building!
under way now," said Mr. Butcher, "and
the prospect is that within a month sev
eral hundred or even a thousand men may
find lucrative employment in these lines
of industry." This opinion is shared by
others, who are in a position to know not
only the present condition of building
trades, but the prospects of the future,
and their assurances may be taken as
significant of the coming of better times
for all wuo are engaged in building trades.
DOING GOOD WORE.
A lamed* Argns.
The Call is doing good work In agitating
for a new Postoffice for Ban Francisco. The
land has been bought, the appropriation has
been madeâ it is The Call's self-imposed task
to ascertain why the work of erecting the
building does not co on.
THE TWEN * V Â» OUR hOUR SYSTEM
Atlanta Constitution.
On the Ist of May next the twenty-four-hour
system of time measurement wi i be adopted
by the railways, postomces and telegraph sta
tions of Belgium.
In order to meet the national demand for
new timepieces the clockmakers of Belgium
have been hard at work for several months
cast. Of course, the new system will be uni
versally adopted throuxhou' the country, as
the action of the railways alone would render
this inevitable. If it proves to be successful, as
it no doubt will, other European countries
will follow the example of Belgium, and In
course o( time the uew system will find its
way across the Atlantic.
There is nothing in the least repugnant
about the new system, and since the day is
twenty-four hours in length there is no good
reason, either practical or scientific, why the
divisions oi the clork should not correspond
with nature's measurements. As the twelve
hour system has been in use so Ion? ihere
are thousands of people who will be loath to
give it up, but t-entimental considerations
should not outweigh practical advantages,
and if the new system is a better one the old
system should be discontinued by all means.

The War in Cubaâ W. S. 8., Mare Island,
Solano County. Cal. The war in Cuba began
in March, 1895. Between the 6th and the 9th
of that month there were daily encounters
between revolutionists and Spanish troops,
but these were mere skirmishes. On the 9th
of March General Garrish reported an attark
made on him by the revolutionists in the
vicinity of Los Negroa, and on the 12th there
was a sharp engagement between the revolu
tionists and the roeular*. About the middl*
of the month was received an account of the
first engagement of any magnitude. It was
that the revolutionists iinder General Mnsso.
some 2000 men, had attacked 2500 Govern
ment troops under General Saldo while the
Spaniards were marching from Manzanillo to
Bayamo, and that the engagement took place
near mat town. Tue date ot the engagement
was not piven, but the Spanish loss was re

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Mme. Camilla Urso, the famous violinist,
supported by her own company, will give sev
eral grand concerts here at the end of this
month. Mme. Urso is too well known in San
Francisco to need introduction, for she is
bound up with the musical history of this
S:ate. In 1869 she came here diract from
Paris, which she left in tne midst of her
triumphs to institute a great music festival.
There were at that time no regular choral so
cieties, and to secure a chorus she had to find
recruits from interior towns in tbS State and
from Nevada. The festival was a great suc
cess and lasted for five days, thousands of peo
ple attending on each day. The proceeds,
which amounted to $27,000, were given to the
Mercantile Library Asaociation. Although
that was so many years ago Mme. Urso has
continued to maintain her high rank amoug
the greatest violinists of the world. ' Iv Sep
tember, 1895, she finished a world's tour in
New York, and since then she has repeatedly
appeared in leading concerts with all her old
time success. In these days, when women
work on an equality with men, it is interest
ing to remember that Camilla Urso was the
fir3t girl who opened the doors of the Paris
Conservatory to members of her sex. She
whs only a child ot eight when she
first gave such undoubted proofs oÂ£ genius
that it was decided she must go to Paris and
enter the Conservatory of Music. Auber, the
composer, was at that time tÂ»e director and
when he was applied to he declared it was im
possible to let in the little Urso; no girl had
ever been admitted nor ever would be; besides
MME. CAMILLA URSO.
she was too young, not even a boy could enter
till 10. People of influence were consulted
in vain and Camilla began to realize what a
very unhappy thing it was to be a girl, still
gne would not despair â nor relax one effort to
tha way of practicing. The winter passed and
spring came, bringing no hope. There were
nine places in the conservatory and seventy
six applicants, every one of them boys. Per
gistance finally carried the day, Mr. Urso
worried th<Â» officers of the conservatory into
hearing his child, though the irritable little
Auber lost hii temper and said: "Well, bring
the girl, we'll hear her play, but she is sure to
fail." At the examination she was admitted
Into the presence of the juryâ sight solenfn
looktng men, each with an inkstand and
paper. TherewereAuber, the director; Rossini,
the great composer; Carrufa, ALard and lour
others. She waa given the "andante" and
"finale" from the Fourth Concerto by Rode.
When she began to play the solemn judges
made no sign of pleasure or surprise, some of
them scratched with their pen*, others looked
at her tn a severe manner, but at the conclu
sion of the child's performance Â«>ach one
voted for her and she wus admif.ed to the con
servatory.
The Camilla TJrso Grand Concert Company
includes, besides the star, Miss Minnie Methot,
soprnno; Edwin H. Douglas, tenor; and George
H. Wesley, pianist. Since she was last here
Mis.- Minnie Methot has been studying in
Europe for two years with Mme. Marchesi, and
appearing frequently in concert in Purl's,
wnere she was often al'uied to by the press as
"La tres jolle Amerlcaine" (the very pretty
American). Kdwin H. Douglas, who has never
been heard here before, is a native of Cleve
land, Ohio. Mme. Urso heard him at one of
the royal coneer's in Dresden last year and his
singing struck her fancy s>o mucn that she at
once engaged him for an American tour. He
MISS MINNIE ME 1 HOT.
has made a specialty of German songs, Eng'.ish
ballads and oratorio work. Before M rm-. Urso
discovered him he had been studying and
singing for three years in Germany. George
H. Wesley is an American pianist who has
made a specialty of studying Chopin. It is
expected that the Urso Concert Company will
open their season about the time that the
French opera season is drawing to a close.
The dates are not yet definitely settled and
the locations for the concert have not been
decided upon, but probably some leading
theater will be selected. It is Intended during
part of the season to engage an orchestra in
order that Mine. Urso may have an opportunity
of playing concertos.
Milan has the monopoly of most of the great
first nights in Italy, for It is at the historic
Scala that the composers when they become
famous produce their operas. This season It
is not an opera, but a ballet, "Sport," that is
creating a musical sensation. Even the first
production of Verdi's "Falstaff" did not create
the interest that this ballet is arousing. There
is some reason in this, for 'Sport" was com
posed by Manzotti, whose score of "Excelsior"
is probably the most attractive and popniar
biLet music of modern times. The plot of
"Sport" is very simple: An ex-danseuse and
a titled English lady are rivals for the love ot
a French Viscount who has ruined himse.f on
the racetrack through the treoson of c jockey.
This trio of lovers pursue one another over
two hemispheres.. The first scene represents
r -n a?cons;on of the Sierras, made by the ex
danseuse in a terrible storm, and when the
clouds that hide the snowy summits are torn
asunder the scene suddenly changes to an ice
palace in Montreal, with a skating ballet,
which ends in a whirlwind of snow, the whole
corps de ballet teine buried in flakes of daz
zling whiteness. The next change ato Long
champs, on the day oj the Grand Tt.x, with a
startlinglv realistic reproduction of the fam
ous racetrack. The waltz in this sceue is taid
to be one of the gems of the score. There are
many other brilliant tableaux, and it is said
that both in the scenario and in the music
Manzoiti has surpassed his "ExC9lsior."
The new operas continue to deviate more
and more from set form. The latest work ot
the untrammeled description is mi "idyle l^ In
three acts by Camille Krlanger, which has just
been produced at the Paris Opera Comique
and which is considered a very curious and in
teresting manifestation ol yric art. "Ker
maria" is not an opera at all In the accepted
sense of the word, neither is it. an oratorio; it
Is a lyric fantasie in which with considerable
melodic ingenuity the composer has tried to
draw tone pictures, not only of characters and
of dramatic action, but of scenery. The poem
of '-Kermaria," which is mystic in character,
was written by If. Uheuci, wbo has laid his
scene in Brittany at the end of the last cen
tury. Kermaria is a haunted aastle crumbling
to ruins on the wild Breton coast. It is ten
anted by the spirit of the Blue Lady who helps
virtuous lovers and makes a mysterious organ
in the castle do miraculous deeds. In spite of
his weird subject and the strange and daring
way in which he has treated it, the French
press hails Camille Erlanger as a coming musi
cian.
It is stated that Jessie Bartlett Davis will
retire from the cast of the Bostocians next
season and star on her own account. Frank
L. Perley, the manager of the Bostonians, re
fusel to disensa the question, but the deacly
work which Mrs. Davis' press aeent is accom
plishing looks ominously like a desire to scar.
This indefatigable man has bombarded the
papers lately with doggerel, ascribed to the
famous contralto, and with puns which she is
s;id to have composed. The following is a
brilliant sample: "Jessie Bartlett Davis says
that the favorite music of dog-fanciers shoufo"
be barcarolles (bark-arolles) " The latest an
nouncement is that Miss Davis eats carrots
instead of bonbins and that she is never with
out a bunch on her dressing-table. When an
actress does strange things of this kind and
proclaims the fact abroad, it is safe to predict
that sue dreams of starring.

A RARE PRESENT.
County Clerk Curry RecoWed a Seattle
of Coal From the Supervisor*
Ye sterility.
County Clerk Curry was the recipient of
a present of a scuttleful of coal from the
Board of Supervisors yesterday. It was
in the nature of a surprise, for such a
thing was altogether unexpected. But
Mr. Curry had come to his office prepared
to resist the attacks of the cold and the
inclement conditions that have for so long
ruled in hia office, and as he was protected
by a Dr. Nansen overcoat, with ear
protectors and fur cap to match, he de
cided to foreeo the comforts of a lire in
his private office and to s are tbe priva
tions and tne general chilliness to wh eh
his deputies and the eeneral public are
subjected.
It is estimated that about 3000 people
daily visit the office of the County Clerk,
including men, women and children, law
yers, liiieants, widows, orphans, wards of
the Probate Court, pensioners, process
servers and others of like character. These
have all complained of <he arctic condi
tions that have made life in the County
Clerk's office almost unbearable for sev
eral month*. _ ...
Kar.y in the season Mr. Curry applied
to the Board of Supervisors for a modicum
of calonr, but he was informed that the
heatins- pipes were in bad con Hionand
that the register would not work, binca
then a long and wearisome winter ha* ""
draased away, an-1 not a day has passed
without dozens of cit zens who had busi
ness there contracting colds, many ot
whioh led to caaesof pneumonia.

OPPOSED TO ANY CHANGE.
Sanchez-Street Property-O\vnerÂ« Aro
>ot in Favor of Mill-Cutting;
The organization of Liberty Heights Im
provement Club is the outgrowth of a dif-
ference of opinion between certain prop
erty-owners on Sanchez, Twenty-first,
Twenty-second and Twenty-third streets
as re., ards the changing of the grade acro-s
the cap of those streets.
Joseph Sheerer and others have peti
tioned the Supervisors for a change of
grade at the points mentioned, which if
granted would make a cut of about twenty
feet. This sweeping gap certain other
property-owners on the heights oppose on
the ground that it would be equal to a for
fe.'ure of their lots, as the &-s*s*.jjients,
would be more than the property is worth.
In order to fight this proposed grade the
Liberty Heights Improvement Club was
organized about two weeks aeo, and at a
meeting held on Tuesday evening the fol
lowing named members were elected a3
the officers of the club: President, Horace
G. Piatt; firsl vice-president, Rolla V.
Watt; second vice-president. J. W. Rug
gles; third vice-president, John E.der;
secretary and treasurer, John J. Wood
house. The question of incorporating was
debated for some time with the result that
it was agreed to have the necessary ar
ticles drawn up, and in addition thereto
to engage the services of an attorney to
enjoin any action that may De taken to
change the grade.
The following were appointed as an ex
ecutive committee: Horace G. Platt, J.
W. Ruggles and J. J. Wood bouse.
The grade on the line of Sanchez street
has been a bone of contention between the
property-owners in that section for a num
ber of years.
The official grade as it now stands had
been established by a former Board of
Supervisors, but on a judicial hearing be
fore Judge Hunt this grade was declared
to be erroneous in consequence of some
informality in passing the ordinance.

THE FACTS NOT
FOR THE PUBLIC
The Water Company De
mands a Pledge of
Secrecy,
But the Â£up?rvisors Are Net
Disposed to Comply Off
Hand.
Private Conference Yesterdayâ The
Board Will Meet A;ain To-
Mcrrow Evening.
The Supervisors met by appointment
yesterday morning at the private office of
Charles Webb Howard, president of the
Spring Valley Water Works Company, for
the purpose of hearing the company's
reasons for declining to unswer certain
questions recently propounded by the
board as a committee of the whole. The
conference was strictly private, repre
sentatives of the press being excluded. It
was learned, however, that the officers of
the company would not retreat from their
original position, which was that the
board might acquire any information it
desired if the members would pledge
themselves not to divulge the same to the
public. The ground taken by the com
pany was that the publication of details,
w.th respect more particularly to the
present valuation of real and personal
property and the holders of stock, would
redound to the injury not only of the
company, but of the public generally. The
Supervisors refused to assume the respon
sibi ity of accepting the company's infor
mation under any such conditions with
out further deliberation as a board, and
adjourned, therefore, to meeTapain at the
City Hall to-morrow evening at 7:30.
An invitation extended to the Supervi
sors by President Howard to visit the
company's works on Saturday morning
was accepted.
In discussing the result of the conference
Dr. Clinton, the chairman of the Water
and Water Supply Committee, said:
"They have already piven us a detailed
list of expenditures' under various head
inps which wi:l be taken up at the next
meeting, when an attempt will be made to
iind out the meaning ot each item. The
company is willing to answer every one of
our questions under a seal of secrecy, but
ii claims that to make public its replies to
certain questions would militate not only
against the best interests of the company
but also of the Cky. It will be for the
board to decide, as a board, whether this
is a valid excuse or not.
"When the company's determination waÂ«
first made known to the Water Committee
we so reported to the board, being quite
unprepared to comply with such a de
mand. It was moved and carried at ihe
last meeting of the board that, the Super
visors should meet to-day as a committee
of the whole to bear the company's reasons
for refusing detailed replies to our ques
tions. We were also to consider whether
these were valid reasons and of sufficient
importance to justify the assertion that
the publication of such information would
be detrimental to the City.
"The company 'ook the same ground
to-day. The first question relative to ex
penditures incurred under operating
expenses includes information concern
ing the amounts expended for sal
aries, legal expanses, recent purchases,
etc., nnd part of this they may or may
not refuse to disclose. The second ques
tion regarding taxes paid in different
counties and the assessed value of the
company's property they l:nve answer.cd
in writing. To enumerate the remaining
questions:
"Third â Of the real property owned by
the company used in the supply of water,
location, the original cost and its present
valuation.
"This has already been answered In
part. Tbe present valuation, however,
they refuse to give on the ground that the
Assessors in the different counties would
probably increase their assessment*,
which would hurt the public as much
as the company. They also contend that
it would be impossible in the absence of
â¢he necessary data to give the original
cost of real property.
"Fourthâ Ot improvements owned by
the company and their valuation.
"The same objection holds good In this
case. They will pive us a list of improve
ments, but may possibly refuse to give us
the valuation ; ,-imilarly with resp ct to
the next question as to the company's
personal property. The next four ques
tions they will answer, viz.:
"Sixthâ Of the pumpmg plan's, loca
tion, capacity, valuation, condition and
the cost of maintenance.
"Seventh â Of the amount oF water
drawn from and furnished from different
sources and supplied to this City and
County.
"Eighth â Of the amount paid on ac
count of new construction and for per
manent improvements.
"Ninthâ Of the amount of bonds issued
and outstanding and the rate of interest
paid thereon.
"The company will eive us the amount
of stoclc issued, but dec ines to divulge
tne names of the stockholders for the
reasons previously mentioned. The lust
que-tion, relative to the amount of bonds
and stocks sold during 1896 and the
amount realized thereon, they will, no
doul>t, answer.
"The majority of the Suneryisors would
not consent to receive the information
under a pledge of secrecy, and as the offi
cers refused to give it without that pledge,
we adiourmd to report to the board and
ask for further instructions on Friday
evening."
THEY ASK FOR A BEIDGE.
I airm-unt Residents Petition the Su-
pervisorg for a Southern Outlet.
The residents on the Fairmount and
Sunnyside ridge complain of the difficulty
they Jjave in reaching the Mission road in
consequence of the deep cut through the
hill at Thirty - fourth street, through
which tne Southern Pacific Railroad runs.
A like obstacle presents itself on Bernal
and College heights in approacnlng the
Fairmount and Sunnyside district, and to
correct these inconveniences the property
owners and residents have joined in sign
ing a petition to the Supervisors to ap
propriate a sufficient sum to build a bridge
over 'his cut.
There is a steel bridge on the line of
Cortland avenue running into Randall
ptreet, on the north of the cut. But this
does not meet with all the requirements
of the people living further west, who
must make a roundabout journey to
reach the Mission road.
The crossing on the line of the railroad
is considered dangerous and a number of
accidents have occurred there. Hence the
necessity of n bridge.

GETTING READY
TO ASSEMBLE
The Postoffice Meeting Will
Be Held This After
noon.
Great Enthusiasm Is Manifested
by All Classes in the
City.
Unanimous Sentiment Is That the
Construction Should Be Bsgun
Without Delay.
All of the arrangements for the mass
meeting, in the Chamber of Commerce at
2 o'clock to-day, that has for its object the
early commencement of the work on the
new Postoffice building in toil t'ify, have
been completed.
Everything indicates that there will be
a very large attendance of representative
citizens of all wa.ks ol life. The six prin
cipal bodies calling the joint meeting rep
resent several thousand business men.
The membership ot the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association comprises
about 650 â mostly firms. The Chamber of
Commerce is composed of 406 names of
business men and firm?. The member
ship of the Builders' Exchange embraces
SSO firms and contractors. In the Mer
chants' Association there are tne names
of 850 firms representing probabl yfour
times that number of people. The San
Francisco and the California State Boards
of Trade will add at least 2500 to the rep
resentation of the meeting. While it is
not expected that every one of these wll
be present, a su fiicient number promised
to fill the Chamber of Commerce Hall to
the doors.
It is believed that either Hugh Craig or
Julian Sonntag will preside, and the sec
retaryship i- likely to fall to either
Captain W. L. Merry, J. A. Filcher or
Oscar Lewis. If Mayor Phelan is able he
will be present. As stated in The Call
yesterday there wiil be plenty of weli-in
formed and able speakers present who
will present the proposition in clear and
concise language, but it is the desire of
those most active to have these speeches
short, crisp and to the point.
In these addresses, however, several
prominent points, already emphasized in
The Call, will be discussed. Among
these are: First, that San Francisco now
has an antiquated old brick and plaster
structure that is sadly showing the rav
ages of time and the accommodations of
forty years ago. It is a constant source
of expense for repairs and alterations, so
that it can be used at all. It is not fit
for the transaction of the volume of busi
ness that goes through it.
A lot for a new Federal building has
been purchased and there is about $240,000
over the amount of the appropriation for
the purchase of the lot witn which to start
the work. With an additional appropri
ation of $2^0,100, that should be made by
the incoming administration, the work
could be continued after the first stated
sum is exhausted for excavation and put
ting in the foundation.
There is no intention of censuring any
of the officials at Washington or the rep
resentatives iv CongreÂ»3 for the already
long delay in tbe commencement of oper
ations, but a respectful memorial will be
presented in which the foregoing facts
will be set forth accompanied by the re
quest that the work be started and means
provided for its continuance.
There is another class in the community
that has not passed without notice and
consideration in this question. The Call
at the earnest stage of this agitation drew
attention to the fact that in this City at
the present time is a large number of un
employed, and the construction of the
new Federal building will give employ
ment to several hundreds of ueserving
people. Whoever obtains employment
thereon will relieve the labor market,
whether he be a skilled mechanic, union
artisan or common laborer without organi
zation. At this particular time any help
in this direction will be of great general
and special relief, because it will place in
circulation a goodly sum of money.
Tho efforts of The Call in starting this
agitation have been appreciated by all
classes, and particularly by the working
people. The San Francisco Labor Coun
cil has gone on record in this matter and
at its last meeting passed strong resolu
tions in keeping wUh the movement.
These will be forwarrted by tde council to
the authorities at Washington.
Thus it is seen that the demand for the
work to begin is made in all directions,
and there is so much sincerity in it that
there is no doubt but what the meeting
to-day will be a grand success
THE MERCHANTS IN LINE.
A Large of the As
sociation Will Beat the Maetlnor.
Early yesterday morning the Merchnnts'
Association issued to its members a call
for them to attend ttie mass-meeting and
join with the otner bodies in an effort to
have the work on the new Postofflce
started at once. The officers of the body
desired before issuing the summons 10
learn if there are any reasons why the
work of construction should not be begun
at once and wired to the Pacific Coast
delegates at Washington for information.
For come reason the information desired
has not come to hand, but for all that the
officers decided not to delay the matter
any longer.
DESIRED BY ALL.
The Federated Improvement Clubs
Urges That the Work
Ba Eecun.
At the meeting of the Federated Im
provement Clubs at B'nai E'rith Hall last
evening a resolution was unanimously
adopted urging the immediate commence
ment of the work on the new Postoffice
building. This action, together with that
of all the other bodies, shows thnt the en
tire population of San Francisco is as one
on the proposition. The resolution, which
was introduced by Judge Van Reynegom,
is as follows:
Whereas, A considerable sum of money hns
been nrpri'priated by the Concress of the
United S.ates Jor the purpose of constructing
a Fostofhcn upon the ste selected by the Gov
ernment in the early part of this decade,
which sum is now available for that purpose
and unexpended; now, thereiore, be it
f.ctolved, That we appeal to our representa
tives In Congress to exert themselves to the
end thnt tho sum be appropriated for which It
was legitimately destined, and that work upon
the Postofflce building be proceeded with at
as early a (late as possible, in order that this
important and ijecessary improvement may be
consummated and work thereby afforded to
some at least of the large number of unem
ployed now In our City who are anxiously
awaiting employment.

THE POLICE TRIBUNAL.
Sergeant Shields Is Exonerated
Frcm a Charge of N.-g'ect
of Duty.
Policeman Charles Cv I urn Promoted
to Be Sergeant, Vice Fitz
gibbon, Deceased.
The Police Commissioners met last
night and heard the charge of neglect of
duty preferred by Captain Robinson of
the City Prl>on against Desk Sergeant
John W. Shields. The desk sergeant was
charged with not visiting the cells eleven
times each night between December 27
and February 13, as required by an order
of Chief Crowley. Sergeant Shields was
represented by Attorney J. N. E. Wilson.
Captain Robinson in his testimony said
that the desk sergeant was physically in
capacitated, owing to old age, from per
forming his duties. He was cranky and
discourteous and very forgetful. He
brought the charges at his own instiga
tion, and he admitted that he did not
complain to Shields at any lime before
preferring the charges and did not have
any conversation with anybody on the
subject.
E. W. Schubert, a prisoner, testified that
twice on the night of February 13, auring
the hours Shields was charged with not
visiting the cells, Shields had taKen
him out of his cell, which was the
last one in the row, to see friends who had
called upon him.
Sergeant Shields testified that he went
his rounds as often as he possible could,
but it was almost impossible to go every
half hour from 6 to 10 o'clock at night, as
these were the hours for vsi tor*. He con
sidered he was ju-it as able to perform his
duties as any other man. The desk ser
geants were hampered by the "trusties,"
who were practically running the prison.
For tJie past, eight months the orders of
the Chief to lock up the "Irusties" at ni>jhi
had been disregarded, and he had seen
them watching him at all hours of the
morning. The desk sergeant and door
keeper were at the mercy of the "trusties,"
who could overpower them and escape if
tbev took the notion.
He had complained to Captain Robin
son about the "trusties," and was told to
mind his own business. They were going
around with pieces of paper keeping tab
on the desk sergeants, and they refused to
take any oraÂ«rs except from the captain.
He complained to the captain at one time
about the condition of the kitchen, and
was told that if it were full of dirt it was
none of his business. One of the
"trusties" named McDonald was allowed
to go downtown by the captain and al
lowed to roAtn at large.
Captain Robinson wanted to make a
statement in reply to Shields, but Presi
dent Tobin curtly toll him that he could
make his explanations to the Chief.
Several other witnesses were examined,
and the Commissioners, after being in ex
ecutive session, dismissed the charges
against Shields, but decided, apparently
owing to the bitter feeling existing be
tween the captain and desk scrgeent, to
transfer the sergeant to another station.
Policeman Charles Cullum of the harbor
district was promoted to be sereeant to
fiil the vacancy caused by the death of
Sergeant Fitzgibbon.
Policeman Harry Riley, who was fined
$50 at a previous meeting for stiiKing Po
liceman Murphy, sent in his resignation,
which was accepted.
SOUTH OP THE PAEZ.
Mayor Phelan and the Street Commit
tee Make a Tout of Inspection.
Mayor Phelan and the Street Commit
tee of the Board ol Sup -rvisors visited the
section south of tne part yesterday after
noon. The board recently rescinded an
order adopted by the preceding board pro
viding that improvements should not be
made in that section until grades have
been adopted. Since then Chairman Dev
any of the Street ComrnittÂ«e has looked
over the pround, conferring with the peo
ple who live there and also with Colonel
Little.who represented Adolph Sutro. Mr.
Devany said yesterday that the committee
favors the opening up of streets south of
the park and will very likely order work
soon. In the meantime there are property
owners whose property is being washed
away ana who are seeking reiiei.
NOW THAT THE
BALL IS OVER
Interesting Gossip Relative
to the Brilliant
Carnival.
Some Queries as to a Reception
Committee That Did
Not Receive.
Debutantes Who W?re Conspicuous
by Their Abseuce and What
They Missed.
The directors of the Hopkins Institute
ol Art are jubilant, and rightly so, over
the brilliant success of their Alardi Gras
ball.
Horace G. Piatt, the president of the as
sociation, expressed himself yesterday as
thoroughly pleased, not only with the
social side of the affair, but the iinancial
end as well. "We took in about $1800,"
he said, "and that figure will just about
cover expenses. We did not expect a sur
plus. These balls are not given with that
object in view. Our desire simply is to
keep up the interest in the art associa
tion,and the many encomiums I have heard
from all sides more than sauries us that
that purpose has been accomplished."
Naturally, the brilliant bah wii< the all
absorb ng topic yesterday in social and
business circles, as well. Gossip was busy
with many amusing little phases, not the
lfen&i interesting of which was the con
spicuous absence of the debutantes. But
two sweet buds graced the realm of bis
majesty of misrule.
Many explanations were offered to make
clear the cause of this misfortune. As
usual the old eag of hard times was tlie
first to be advanced. "So much has been
done for the debutantes this year," ex
plained several mothers, according to
Dame Rumor, "that really we felt they
might omit the masked ball. Then times
are hard, and an expensive costume at the
tail end of the season â " Another ver
sion, according to the same reliable au
thority, is that papa objected. "There
are so many spicy stories afloat regarding
mask balls, you know, that we found it
best to let our daughter wait until next
year."
The real knowing ones, however, affirm
that the papa theory came the nearest of
all, and this is their story.
It happened last year that the vener
able papa of a prospective bud, upon
whom had been conferred the enviable
duties of one or the vise committee, was
indiscreet enough to permit a woman â a
very pretty woman â who had neglected
the formality of applying for a card of ad
mission, to enter the ballroom. He spent
all the evening by her side. The men
envied him, and she was ignored by the
women. The sequel of the story runs that
his wife declared he should never go to
a masked ball again. So what could the
poor man do? He bad to stay at home.
Consequently his wife had to stay at
home, and, naturally, the debutante
daughter.
This debutante leads in her very exclu
sive set, and her absence meant the ab
sence ot her next-door neighbor, the belle
ol nil the buds. Tne poor little girls
passed the word, and the result was that
only two of this season's debutantes wit
nessed the short but merry rule of Prince
Carnival. That, however, was their loss,
and there were tears and gnashing of
teeth â still the same, reliable source for
authority â In blue and white and white
and sold boudoirs this morning.
Other absentees at the much discusse t
ball were the ladies who constituted the
reception committee, but did not receive.
When a meeting of the honorary
patronesses some few weeks before the
ball was called the ladies promised to
stand by, provided a reception committee
was appointed to give tone to the affair.
A reception committee at a ball is an in
novation of the fashionable Monday Night
Club. The directors of the institution,
only too happy to conform to fashion and
at the same time please the ladies, ap
pointed the committee desiretl. A plat
form hung with costly rugs was erected
and the committee members were ex
pected to stand in imposing array on
either side of the carnival prince. But
like the buds Only two ladies of the recep
tion committee put in an appearance.
Various causes have explained their ab
sence. One lady had a dinner party. An
other was not feeling well. Still another
feared the chilling effects of the inclement
weather, and Â»o on down the entire list.
Nearly all, however, sent some member
of their family to represent them in the
merry throng, and in spite of anything
the gossips may whisper, no one missed the
ladies of the reception committee, no one
missed the buds. The loss was simply
and only theirs.
Embezzlement Charged.
John Croder, a painter living at 228% Tenth
street, was arrested last night by Policemen
Hyan and ODea on a warrant charging him
wltn felony embezzlement. The complaining
witness is Mrs. Kit* McGord, 1731 Valencia
street, who charges him \vi4h embezzling $75.
Her husband turned sick, and took a trip to
Australia for his health. During his absence
Croder finished a job for him, and, Mrs. Mc-
Cord alleges, collected the $75 and appropri
ated it to his own u*o.

ONE MENACE TO
BAY NAVIGATION
Arch Rock Will Be Blown
Up in the Near
Future.
Government Engineers Are Now
at Work on the Pre
!iminari:s.
Narrow Escapa of the Government
Steamrr McDowell From a
Collision.
Arch Rock is doomed. Before the mid
dle of May it will be a thing of toe past,
and one more "menace to navication" in
the bay of San Francisco will be gone.
For weeks past United States engineers
have been at work taking soundings and
getting the exact bearings of the ledge of
rock. Yetiterday a man was stationed on
the rock and he was the subject of much
speculation on the part of the people on
the ferry steamers. He was simply there,
however, to wave a red flag, and tnus en
able the engineers at different points to
get the exact bearings of the rock. The
work of destruction will be done by dyna
mite, and judging from the care that das
been taken in the preparations everything
should pass off successfully.
The aptiearance of the man on the rock
caused a great disturbance among the
leathered colony. Gulls, shags and grebss
rose in hundreds, and after circling
around for awhile and finding that the
new occupant of the rock had no inten
tion of leaving at once they settled down
on ths water to await his departure. Half
an hour after he was gone the rock was
once again covered with its old in
habitants.
The Government steamer McDowell had
a narrow escape yesterday. As she was
making her dock the river steamer On
ward was backing out Captain Stofen of
the McDowell blew two wnistles, but the
Onward took no notice and kept on back
ing. Seeing that his vessel would be cut
down if he did not get under way Captain
Stofen ordered tt,e engines full speed
ahead, and just cleared the big atern
wheeler. He could not clear the wharf,
however, and the McDowell struck it
hard, knocking out a couple of piles and
splintering several planks. The owners
of the Onward have agreed to pay for the
damage, but the chances are that Captain
Hansenwiii be called before the Inspect
ors of Hulls and Boilers.
The schooner Vine over which there has
been so much anxiety has beea spoken at
last. On January 10 she was Is the Gilbert
group all well. The Vine left here last
year for the South Seas, via Corinto.
After leaving Corinto was not heard
from again umil a telegram came from
Australia saying she was in the Gilbert
group. The friends of Captain Luttrell
had begun to fear that something had
happened to the vessel.

Bicyc c.
CARSON, Nev., March 3.â Dan Stuart,
the promoter of the great boxing carnival
about to take place in Carson, made his
appearance on the streets to-day for the
first time in nearly three weeks. Afte*>
days of promising his doctors finally per
mitted him to leave his apartments and
take a walk â not a ride this time â and
quite naturally the bold Texan, who
stands to lose a fortune or double the one
lie has on the mammoth project, headed
himself for the headquarters he established
on Carson street only a faw days before he
took to his bed. He looked over the books
and the box-sheet, and expressed himself
as being highly pleased with the manner
in which his lieutenant, W. K. Wheelock,
and his force of assistants had been con
ducting things. By this time he felt the
effects of his outing and. fearing a relapse,
hurried back to his rooms.
Stuart has been a very sick man. A
glance at him to-day was enough to con
vince anybody of that fact. Pneumonia
always does play havoc with bic robust
men, snch as is Stuart, and his case was
no exception. On two occasions during
his illness his physicians despaired of sav
ing his life, but at the special request of
the patient the real facts of his condition
â were kept as quiet as possible, arid not
only were boscru friends denied the privi
lege of visiting him, but they could not
even ascertain where he was domiciled.
Dan seemed to feel all along that he would
squeeze out of bis predicament all right,
and ho feared the effects of the stories re
garding his condition. Were it known
that he was practically at death's door a
doubt was bound to extend abroad as to
whether or not the greatest prize-fighting
project ever evolved would after all suc
ceed, and this doubt would prevent hun
dreds from making up their minds and
journt-yujg to Carson. Stuart realized ail
this and realized how many a dollar could
be kept out of his pocket ana reader the
grvat carnival a failure.
It was Stuart's intention to leave to
nijrht for San Francisco, and his physi
cians, believing that he was sufficiently
recovered to star.d the journey, gave their
consent, but after to-day'.s outing it was
found that the genial Texan was not as
strong as he appeared to be, and the con
templated excursion was peremptorily
called off. It is thought, however, that
he will be able to make the trip before the
end of the week. He goes for a change of
eir, in the hope that he will mend faster.
This morning marfced the beginning
of Corbett's outdoor training at Shaws
Springs. The snow is now well off the
ground and the roads are rapidly drying,
making lone tramps and short sprints
possible. The slop and slush has not
kej.-t Fitzsimmons indoors since his stay
here, but Cortett has exhibited % decided
aversion to going out under such condi
tions, and has stubbornly and steadfastly
ignored the advice of his trainers in this
respect. He has his reasons, however.
and for aught anybody knows they may
cave been the best after all. Jim seems
.to be in mortal dread of contracting a cold
or meeting with some mishap which
might lessen his chances of defeating the
red-headed Cornisiiman, and he has all
along during the bad weather taken no
risk of wetting his feet or defying the
peculiarly treacherous climate that is Car
son's at this time of the year.
"No, I would prefer to go into the ring
half-trained than to appear there with an
excuse of sickness," was the way James J.
expressed it to me recently. "If I wanted to
.be a little severe I ccuid venture the opin
ion that Fitz, by taking the chances
be does, is inviting some sort of an ail
ment that will give him and his friends a
â¢ chance to say after I have thrashed him
that be was not at his bestâ that I
â whipped a sick man. But so iong as he is
holding his health I will not publicly
accuse him of willful carelessness, no mat
ter what I may think of his conduct. As
regards myseif, however, I propose, with
the consent of Providence, to go into the
ring without an ache or a pain or any
thing that will furnish an excuse for de-
feat. If Fitzsimmons is a better man than
I nm I want to Know it anl I want to find
it out when lam right. If lam whipped
I will have no excuse to offer."
Trainers Delaney and White have been
anxiously awaiting the tima when they
could get the champion out on the roads.
Both of them â and Delaney in particu-
lar â have formed the opinion that Cor
bett's appetite for work would have ;o be
curbed in some manner or other to pre
vent him from growing stale. They have
feared the effects of exclusive indoor
work, especially when taken in such doses
as Corbett prescribes for himself.
Along with Jeffries and several others
: of his retinue, Corbett went out on the
main road leading to aud from'the springs
and took a good brisk walk, winding up
with a sprint for the cottage. The rest of
Ins day's work was light, comprising a
short spell of bag-punching and several
set-tos with his sparring partners. Cor
bett is still enjoying his vacation as the
result of the visit to his training quarters
of Mrs. Corbett and his sister, and was
not expected by bis handlers to stick to
his customary heavy routine work. The
ladies leave to-iuorrow evening for San
Francisco, and on the day foilowins Pom-
padour James will be put through some
of the severest work be has experienced
Champion Corbett's Wife and Sister Welcomed on Their Arrival at Carson.
yet, the bulk of which will be done out in
the open air. This course will be con
tinued up to the day before the big fight.
Fitz essayed to acid a new feature to his
outdoor work this morning, but did not
make a howling success of it. He trotted
out his bicycle and announced that he
was going to make a flying trip into town.
It did not take long for Robert to find out
that he had grown decidedly rusty as an
expert biker. He made a very gracelul
mount, but he could not get control of the
steering gear, and before he could pilot
the wheel out of the yard and reach the
road he sailed against a chicken-house
with a resounding crash. The squawk
ing and fluttering of the frightened fowl
as they scattered in all directions compen
sated Bob for the painful bump he re
ceived and put him back into good
humor. With the aid of a monkey wrench
the damages sustained by the bike were
remedied and the Cornishman made his
second start. This time he got along
somewhat better, the only misbap being
the running over of a one-eyed_cat and a
light tumble after he had got out on the
road. He sailed along fairly well after
that, but soon returned with the com
plaint that the plaguey wheel wobbled
and was crazy.
The Cornishman put in his usual
amount of hard work during the day, bui
was sneaky about it, watching for a !
chance lo slip into bis gymnasium when !
no visitors were around. He has of late
developed a etranee antipathy for enter- j
taining callers, despite the fact that he
maintains a bar out at the ranch which
these same cr.llers are expected to snp- |
port. His conduct in this re ard was the j
means of producing a loud ana continu- \
ous roar from a large party Oi visitors
who had obtained tickets of admission to
the grounds, paid fares and supposed
they were eatitled to see him at his work.
Fitzsiinmons and Julian have an under
standing with a Car*on livery firm by
which only persons who patronize this
particular stable can secure the coveted i
admission pasteboards. The crowd that I
"kicked" to-day observed all of these re- j
quirements, yet as soon as Fitzsimmons \
saw it coming he put on his coat and cap !
and left the ranch with one of his trainers
for a tramp over the hilJs. The disap- 1
pointed visitors made their complaint so
strong that they succeeded in having tueir
money refunded.
But incidents of this character have
nothing to do with Bob's preparation for
the coming battle. There can be no ques
tion as to his superb condition despite
tne stories that he has been carousing of
late; and, by the way, 1 was informed bj
ono of the tall fellow's trainers to-day that
he has decided to eschew those evening
trips into town and their attendant
frolics among the saloons.
Talk over Assemblyman Dempsey's in
tended bill to provide the winner of the
Corbett-Fitzsimmons contest with a belt
has subsided now that Dempsey, at the
reauest of Dan Stuart, has decided not to
introduce the measure. A good deal of
sport is being had, however, at theÂ» ex
pense of a couDle of young "exclusive"
newspaper men who were "scooped" on
this news. An effort wss made to prove
that the whole story was a fraua, but this
fell flat when it was found that the origi
nal bill that Dempsey took to the Capitol
for presentationâ and would have pre
sented iiad not Stuart headed him off â
bad fallen into the hands of a rival corre
spondent.
The big amphitheater in which the
carnival battles are to be fought is going
ud so rapidly that Architect Donohoe
assuies me now that it will be finished
next Monday. On Friday of this week,
both Corbett and Fitzsimmons will be
taken to the arena, not ao much to give
them a general idea of the appearance of
the place as to give them an opportunity
to point out where they would like to have
their respective dressing-rooms located.
Of course they will not be allowed to be
there at the same time, for that would
never do.
The platform upon which the ring is to
be set is already in position. The task of
erecting the ring itself, will devolve upon
C. B. Tidball of San Francisco, the man
who strung the ropes for the contests at
the Mechanics' Pavilion in which both
Corbett and Fitzsimmons figured with
Sailor Sharkey.
"Mysterious" Billy Smith, who is
matched to compete with George Green
for the welter-weight championship, as
certained to-day that there was no room
for him out at Fitzsimmons' training
quarters, so he decided to do his prepara-
Tory work at Genoa, which is twelve or
thirteen miles from Carson. This means
that Biliy will not have many visitors
during his training. Martin Flaherty,
the Eastern feather-weight who is to do
battle with Dal Hawkins, will arrive to
morrow and will proDably go to Genoa,
tco, as there are no other suitable train
ing quarters left.
Major Phil Clark, aweil-known sporting
man of Dallas, Tex., and cousin of Dan
Stuart, arrived in town this afternoon,
and will from now on assist in getting
things ready for the carnival. Bat Mas
terson, than whom no member of the
sportine world is better known on the con
tinent, will be in to-morrow. Bat, I un
derstand, is to take full charge of Stuart's
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 4, 1897,
private police, and will be responsible for
the maintenance of order during the big
contests. Bat understands his business.

Are to Compete.
CARSON, Nev., March 3.â Entries for
the big live-bird shoot to be held in con
junction with the fistic carnival come in
from all quarters by every mail. There
appears to be some trouble in making
prospective competitors understand the
con ditions and it is impossible to answer
all individual requests for information on
tbet point. Stuart made to-day the fol
lowing announcement:
The live-bird shoot will bo inaugurated
on the afternoon of March 17, immedi
ately on the conclusion of tho Corbett-
Fitzsimmons contest. The first event will
be for the live-bird championship of the
world and the trophy now held by Cham
pion Elliot, with $50 entrance fee and
$1000 added money. If there are more
than five entries this event alone will be
shot off on that day. If there are les9,
the Stale championship shoot will be
commenced and concluded, if possible,
on the same day.
On the morning of March 18 the grep.t
Nevada sweepstakes, a handicap, $3 en
trance fee and half of the gate receipts
added, will be shot. This will consume
all the time not devoted to the Smith-
Green ana Hawkins-Flaherty contests.
With a possible attendance of over 10,000,
one-half of the gate receipts snoula net
the marksmen a not of not less than
$5000 to shoot for. This will be cut up into
hve moneys as follows: First money, 30
percent: second, 25; third, 20; fourth, 15,
and fifth, 10 per cent.

OMAHA, Ner., March 3.â Of all the
people interested in the coming fistic bat
tle there are none who have a deeper
interest than Mr. and Mrs. James 8.
Taylor of this city, the lather-in-iaw and
mother-in-law of Corbett. Mr. Taylor
said to-nicht that he was unacquainted
with his daughter's future plans, but that
she would probably reside in San Fran
cisco until after the coming battle and
then return to her home in New York
City. Her husband had promised bit wife
half the prize money, and, as he knew
Jim's generous nature probably better
than any one, he had ,no doubt that she
would gel it, for he was as sure as he was
that he was alive that hia son-in-law
would win hands down.
"I spÂ»-nt a week with Jim in St. Louis
about six weeks ago," said Mr. Taylor,
"and I never saw iiim drink a drop of any
thing but Vichy. He was then in Bplendid
condition, but there were some papers
telling how he was out of shape and such
stuff all the time 1 was there. In fact,
Jim is in shape all the time."
WEST WINS FROM WALCOTT.
Hammer and Tongs From the Start and
the Referee Decides for the
Chicago Boy.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 3.â Tommy
West of Chicago defeated Joe Walcott of
Boston, the hitherto invincible welter
weight, in their twenty-round bout at the
Broadway Athletic Club to-night. Wal
cott was giving away a lot of weight and
though he fought gamely his colors were
fairly lowered. He was badly punished,
while West had not a mark.
There were about 2500 spectators present
when the main bout was put on. The
betting was 2 to 1 on Walcott. George
Dixon wÂ»3 the colored man's chief second
and "Dock" Dougherty looked after West.
Walcott weighed abou: 140, West 160.
Walcott led off with a half-dozen hard
body blows before \Vest got in two good
lefts on the face. The righting was hard
throughout.
The eleventh round was a slugging
match all around. West reached Walcott
hard on the face. Joe landed three times
on the jaw. West pounded his man al
most to a standstill in the thirteenth
round and the referee had a hard job to
break Walcott out of clinches. Walcott
had the best of the early part of the four
teenth, but West baa him very tired when
the gong rang.
Walcott was cautioned about fouling.
West forced the righting in the next four
rounds. Walcott cut loose in the nine
teenth round and sent several hard ones
to the wind. Both slugged wildly in the
windup, but could do no damage.
The referee gave the decision to West.

Distressing Cases Continually ported
to the Unemployed Organi
zation.
The special and , district relief commit
tees took advantage of the fine weather
yesterday to do a little rustling, but
though a good many promises were re
ceived, the only actual cash subscription
in the hands of Daniel Meyer as late as 4
m. was $25 from A. P. Williams. This
swells the total amount of receipts to
$257150. The directors of the Fir3t Na-
tional Bank, at a meeting yesterday, voted
flOOtothe fund, and other members of
the various committees have reported
"promises to pay." NonÂ© of these pros
pective contributions exceed three fieures.
Secretary Fay stated that the general
committee was awaking the report of the
special and district committees, which
would probably be received this afternoon.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors will also meet to-day at 2 p. M.
to take action relative to the right-of-way
deeds given by ex-Mayor Sutro and the
Spring Valley Water Works and for the
purpose of regulating the manner m
which the work on the boulevard will be
conducted. As soon as these necessary
formalities are settled the general commit
tee can start a cane of men to worK and
expects to be aole to do so not later than
Tuesday.
The Bald Eagle Tribe No. 75, Improved
Order cf Red Men, has communicated
with Secretary Fay offering to devote the
proceeds of a iecture on the "Aborigines
of the American Continent" which will
be delivered by Professor Frank J. Pow
ley of the Stanford University at the
Metropolitan Temple on the evening of
the 24th, to the citizen's relief fund.
Out at the Armory the men were feeling
depressed yesterday over the tartly de
pleted condition of the larder and the
prospect of empty stomachs. The first
round of the commissariat wagon proved
disastrous, for during the entire course of
its precession up Sansome street and its
return via Jackson street, the only dona
tions received were some tea and coffee
from 417 Sansome street and 410 Jackson
street, ana a small quantity of old cloth
inp. Later in the day the following route
was pursued with more encouraging
results.
Pown Market to Drumm, down Drnmm to
Jackson, up Davis to Market street.
In addition to a wagon-load of stuff tne
sum ol $8 35 in cash was contributed by
the generously disposed merchants who
do business on those streets. The com
plete iibt of donations is as follows:
Three sacks of potatoes, two sacks of onions,
sack of prunes, box of sweet potatoes, five
pounds of coffee, sack of floor, box of maca
roni, kit of salmon, six handkerchiefs, six
suspenders and sack of carrots.
M. Miller & Co. of 2149 Mission street gave
eleven pairs o! new children's and ladies'
shoes, several pairs of men's shoes, two hats
and a bundle of clothing. Mrs. J. Knudson of
118^ Langtou street and J. McCord of 20 Mc-
Allister street also donated clothing.
J. de la Montanya, the stove-dealer on
Battery and Sansome streets, has offered
to supply the unemployed with a large
boiler for cooking purpose! if he can ob
tain some assurance that it will reach its
lawful destination. With that object in
view he desires that those who help to re
move it from his premises shall be prop
erly identified as bona-fide members of
the organization.
It may be said in this connection that
numerous impostera are abroad. Many
charitable people give money and pro
visions to applicants, who exhibit forged
credentials purporting to orae from the
organization. To guard against the fur
ther repetition of such impositions, which
deprive the worthy ot that whicli is really
intended for their assistance, a fac-simile
of the unemployed credentials is pro
duced here wi ill.
The executive committee of the organi
zation waited upon the Butchers' Board
of Trade Tuesday evening ana was in
formed that although the board could do
notuing officially, the members individu
ally would advise concerted action and
would do all in their power to render as
sistance.
Mr. Leavitt has secured the services of
about fifty of the hundred performers who
will take part in the benefit entertainment
to be given in the Auditorium on Tues
day evening, March 9. He states inci
dentally tnat he will be pleased to accept
the services of any available talent, his
trionic and musical, in the meantime.
Several charitable ladies have under
taken to dispose of ticket-* and Siebe &
Green will attend to the bill-posting free
of charge.
Work was found yesterday for two men
at 745 Mission street, at $1 25 a day; for
one man at 2705 Mission street, at $20 a
month and board, and a waiter's position
is open for another man at Lincoln.
Chairman Leffingwell and his colleagues
are considering the advisability of putting
in a telephone to facilitate the supply of
labor, and wish it to be understood that
they are prepared to furnisn every possi
ble description of help without charging
ofnce fees.
The family relief committee attended to
thirty applications up to 4 o'clock yester
day. Two of these cases were of a pe
culiarly distressing nature. A Mrs. Sarah
Brown was turned out of the City and
County Ho-p::al recently soon after hav
ing undergone an operation, and was re
ferred by the committee to a lady who has
l el;ied the committee in many ways since
its organization. She, however, was over
burdened at the time with charitable work
and advised the committee to send the
woman to the rescue home. The commit-
tee did so, but the home officials refused
her admission. Meanwhile she is abso
lutely without shelter, besides being seri
ously ill.
Mrs. Ellen Fennessy is an old lady of 70
years who was recently ejected from

to the scarcity of accommodation, she is
compelled to sleep on the floor. Cold and
exposure have reduced her to a pitiable

GROCERS EAGER
FOR PURE FOOD
But They Condemn the
Action of the Board of
Health.
The Parties Implicated Deny AH
Knowledge of Adultera
tion.
The? Cannot Pretend to Analyz
Everything Soldâ Producers
Really Responsible-
The action of ttie Board of Health and
the representatives of the pure-food com
mittee of the Council of Associated In
dustries in issuine warrants for the arrest
of local retail and wholesale grocers on
the charge of selling adulterated goods
has aroused a great deal of surprise, not
to say indignation, among the parties
implicated.
These gentlemen almost without excep
tion assert that the charge is ill founded,
or at any rate that the retailers, who dis
pose of presumably high-class articles in
good faith, should not be carried into the
Police Courts Jike ordinary bums and
drunks. Their argument briefly expressed
is that if the Board of Health really de
sires to insure a pure food supply it should
properly proceed against the manufactur
ers and agents, from and through whom
tlie goods were originally p ocured.
William Cline, the wholesale and retail
grocer, of 949 and 951 Market street,
against whom a warrant was issued on
Tuesday, said last night:
"We handle the very Â»am 6 class of
goods as Goldberg, Bowen & Co., Lie ben
baum & Co., Uibo, Newman & Co., and
other large -feouses, and it seems rather
strange ttiat no action has been taken
against tho!>e firms. Why the authorities
should always make a target of me indi
vidually is something I don't understand,
unless they are actuated by personal mo
tives. This is the fourth time they have
gone after me. We hamlle only first-class
goods, such as Gordon & Dil (worth's cat
sup, Snider's catsup, Curtis' Blue-label
catsup, Eagle milk. Highland cream, Tip
top and Rowe's Brand milk. If these are
adulterated we do not know it, and the
only way we could find out would be to
open every can and have tne contents
analyzed, and then we should have noth
ing to sell. Personally I w.ould be in favor
of having all adulterated goods thrown
out of the market, and if Mr. Dockery and
the Board of Health can devise some
method of accomDlishing this object I
will be among the first to indorse it.
A. Quade of A. Quade & Co.. 636 Market
street, wno is charge t with selling evapo
rated cream containing an insufficient
quantity of butter fat. said: "The cream
1 sell has been exhibited here for years,
notably at the Mechanics' Fair. If the
representative of a reputable Ea-tern
manufacturer offers me goods generally
recognized as pure and wholesome I deal
with him. lam not an analytical chem
ist; I am a grocer. Furthermore these
evaporated creams are sold by all the lead
ing crocera here, and how is it that the
Board of Health makes such distinction
and selects two or three respectable deal
ers and not all. The action of the board
might be more profitably airected against
the agents and cheap manufacturers."
Harper Smith of Smith's Cash Store
saia : "On learning of the board's action
we communicated with Dodge. Sweeney
& Co., who supplied us with the Ameri
can brand of milk condemned. They as
sure us that it contains nothing but pure
cow's milk with all its original fats and
the requisite amount of c mc sugar to
give it Keeping quality. They are willing
to vouch for the authenticity of this state
ment. We also have testimonials in favor
of the milk from such people as Tillmann
& Bendel,' the Alaska Packers' Associa
tion, George Schonewald and Captain A.
Cooper of the Royal Firth.
"If tho board would let us know when
an adulterated brand is discovered we
would immediately stop its sale, but this
underhand method of buying goods from
a few selected firms is not a fair proceed
ing on its face. With respect to the
honey, we get this from the country to
avoid glucose adulteration, and cane sugar
is not a deleterious article in any sense."
M. Rathjen of Rathjen Bros., 2l Stock
ton street, expressed similar sentiments
to the foregoing. The condemned articles,
he said, were purchased with a euarantee
from the manufacturer and if the action
of the board was sustained he would look
to the former for an explanation.

An inkling of rain in the skies and a
rather uncomfortable breeze blowing
did not dim the love of the fair sex for
horse racing, for Ingleside track was well
patronized yesterday on the occasion of
â 'ladies' day." The card was not up to
the usual high standard main tamed by Hie
local track, out it mattered not with the
ladies. They predominated i;i the grand
stand and grew just as enthusiastic over
the finishes as though Henry of Navarre
and Requitals were battling for the purses.
Several badly depleted bank rolls hawked
about by several individual members of
the talent, cobwebbed covered and musty
booking over the result of the spilis the
past few clays, were revived somewhat, as
four, of the six first choices s nt their ad

which they were started.
Of the jockey division Willie Martin and
iitue Clawson, a clever boy, who rides for
Atkin & Lottridge, divided the riding
honors, eaca piloting two winners past the
wire.
The two-year-old scramble at four fur

son of Islington, own brother to Isin
glass, is quite a promising youngster.

Owner Pat Dennis' colors, was a;i 8 to 5

HAIR CAN BE RESTORED.
Successful Process Which Has
Been Discovered by a
Local Scientist.
Several Citizens Bear Evidences of
This Most Wonderful
Inv ntioa.
William Henry Druhe, a local scientist,
has discovered an invention which no
doubt will net him a fortune before long.
It is a process by which he can restore
hair on bald head?. This invention, how
ever, is not altogether a new one, for Mr.
Druhe has been working out his ideas,
which are founded on a purely scientilic
basis, for many years past, and it is
claimed by the gentleman that the result
of his untiring efforts have been awarded
with a phenomenal invention. . At the
parlors of the eminent scientist, at 1247
Market street, corner of Ninth, between
the hours of 2 and 5 F. m., there are to be
seen daily many living exemplifications
of the great discovery.
The following is a copy of an affidavit
which was compiled and sworn to by Mr.
Druhe, and is an evidence) of one of the
many patients who stand ready to vouch
for the great things that have been done
for them by this great scientist:

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 4, 1897.
A LITTLE GIRL IN
A BOY'S BREECHES
Four- Year-Old Effie Hol
strom in a Mas
querade.
Her Long Curls Had Been
Ruthlessly Shorn to Complete
Her Disguise.
Mrr. Fredericka Van Valkenberg Ar
r-sted on a Charge of Taking the
Child Out of iht State.
Nearly every trapedy has its phase of
comedy, and this was illustrated in Judge
Coffey's court yesterday, when the case of
littie Kilie V. E. Holsirom was called for
hearing.
Attorney Matt I. Sullivan introduced
the subject by informing the court that
the little girl was in court disguised as a
boy.
"May have been at the Mardi Gras
EFFIE HOLSTROM, Otherwise "Tommy/* as She Appeared in
Judge Coffey's Court Yesterday Afternoon.
masquerade last nipht and has not had '
time for a change of costume," suggested
the court.
Then Mrs. Fredericka Van Valkenberg
of 1628 Dolores street was asked to take
the witness-stand. She did so very re
luctantly, haying with her a rosy- cheeked,
chubby child dressed in a boy's sailor suit,
knee pants and all complete, with the
word "Defender" printed on the cap.
Mrs. Van Vaikenberg at first declined to
be sworn, and wanted to know why she
! had been arrested, saying that the orlicers
I had bandied her very rudely. She was
| calmed at last, but refused to disclose the
identity of the child in her possession,
saying that she understood that the
mother is named Mrs. Hazel Fox. that she
did not dress the chiid and did not know
whether it was a boy or a girl.
Police Officer Coleman testified that he
could identify the child as the girl Eflie
HoUtrom, notwithstanding tne disguise,
and the fact that her long black ringlets
I had been cut off.
Judge Coffey suggested that the child
i be questioned in regard to the matter of
; identity, so Mr. Sullivan asked:
"What is vournnme?"
"Tommy!" replie i the little one with
out a moment's hesitation.
"What?" cried Mr. Sullivan. "You say
yonr name is Tommy?"
"Yes, Tommy."
It was evident that the astute lawyer
was puzz ed by this four-year-old infant,
but reflecting on the positive identifica
tion of Officer Coleman, he returned to
the attack.
"Wnat is your other name besides
Tommy?" he asked.
"Tommy Fox," was the reply of the
imperturbable young witness. She had
learned her lesson well and stuck to her
â  story.
Court and counsel for a moment ap
peared to be dismayed. At length Judge
Coffey said in a very serious tone: "It
now becomes requisite that the sex of this
child shall be established. There arc
some things that you cannot ask of the
court. This is a matterior a medical man.
Let the bailiff request the attendance of
the City Physician. 1 '
So Deputy Sheriff Finn invited Dr.
Howard Thompson of the Receiving Hos
pital to step up into Judge Coffey's wit
ness-room, to which Mr?. Van Vaiken
berg and her precious charge were per
mi'ted to retire.
When they appeared in court again Dr.
Thompson was sworn and testified that
tlie child in male attire was in fact a little
girl-
Mrs. Van Valkenberg was subjected to
a searching examination by Mr. Sullivan,
but she denied that she had been hired to
take the child to Fresno and thence to
Michigan, or that she had intended to re
move the child beyond the jurisdiction of
the State when arrested. She admitted
that Mrs. Fox. the reputed mother of the
chilÂ«i, is in reality Mrs. Luc nda Holstrom.
Then the entire story was clear to the
court. Mrs. Holstrom bought the child,
which wus born out of wedlock, from Miss
Saliie McGuire. nbout four years ago, for
$10. Miss McGuire has since married a
man named D. d'Artnay, who lives near
Woodland, in this State, and is desirous
of regaining custody of her offspring.
This is opposed by Mrs. Holstrom, who
has become much attached to the little
girl.
Several weeks ago the child was taken
by force from Mrs. Holstrom and delivered
to Mr-. D'Arinay. Subsequently the lit
tle one was kidnaped in Woodland by Mrs.
Hol-trom's husband and brought to this
City. Since then both women have filed
petitions for legal guardianship, Â«Â»ach ac
cusing the other of being unworthy to
hnve (he gnardian of so tender a mind.
Judge Coffey thought that all parties
The' facsimile /0^ _f/&?t - J^'- Uon eVery vrTÃl^ -
â ignature of C^a/^yfTcc^U^ of CASTORIA.
imerested ought to be heard in the case
and therefore he gave the little one into
the care of the matron of tde Receiving
Hospital until 10 o'clock this morning, at
which time Attorney Eugene DeuDrey
will be present to represent Mrs. Hol
stroru.
All who saw the child in court declared
tha' the disguise was first-class and Officer
C.leman was congratulated for hiÃ
shrewdness in balking what the lawyers
for Airs. D'Artnay think was a plan to re
move little Effie beyond the court's juris
diction. ______________

Cora Hill, Sick and Despondent, Saved
From a Watery
Grave.
Cora Hill, a woman living at 515 Kearney
street, was found wanaerinj; along the
water front Tuesday night, and, as she ap
peared to be hysterical, she was taken to
the Harbor Police Station and later to the
Receiving Hosnual as she declared her in
tention of drowninc herself. She was de
tained in the hospital till yesterday after
noon when a young man called and took
her away v.itli him.
The woman said she was a native of
Birmingham, England. She could not
get along wit â  her stepmother and came
here about four years ago. She tried to
get work, but tailed for a long time, and
then she earned wages barely enough to
keep her alive. She applied 10 the British
Consul to send her home, but he refused.
Then she applied for relief to the British
Benevolent Society and got a dollar. She
did not care 10 apply again.
She had been sick for some time and a
few weefcs ago was arrested lor vagrancy,
but was ilischarged. Sue got so despond

Witbin Twiniy-F-ur Hours

Coroner Hawkins is investigating the
death of John Fenton, who expired sud

twenty-four hours.
Fenton was an old and valued employe
of Wells, Fargo & Co., having driven one
of their wagons for thirty years and had
for tome time been in feeble health owing
to heart trouble.
He â wii.-' attending to bu&iness on Satur

"Jerry " Drisco'l. He died there on Mon
day morning, and it is the circumstances
surrounding ins demise that the Coroner
will look into.
Dr. Samuel Newman signed a death
certificate to the effect that he had died
of apoplexy, but it appears that
he met with an accident m the house that
made the case one for the Coroner. Dr.
Newman was told, so he says, that Fenton
had had a fainting lit and that he had
fallen against the foot of a bed, striking
his head. The doctor also stated that on
Thursday last Fenton called on him to be
treated for heart troubles and had made
nn appointment to ccme again on Friday,
but had failed to keep ti.e engagement.
When it w;is learned at the office of
Wells, Fargo & Co. that fenton was ill an
employe went to see him. This man
gained the impression, from what was
told nim at the titne. tint Fent <n had
fallen downstairs and injured his head so
that he remained unconscious until tho
iiour of his death.
The case hus many of the elements of an
accident and when the Coroner's attention
was called to tne matter yesterday he de
cided to look further into it.
Fenton was an Odd Fellow and his body
was placed in the nands of that organiza
tion for burial. It was sent to Gray's un
dertaking parlors and thÂ° funeral will be
held from there to-day unless the Coroner
decides that an autopsy is necessary.
Fenton and his wie, when th'-y were
married some years ago, each took out a
life insurance policy for $1030 in favor of
the other. Mrs. Fenton died about a
month ago and her husband intended tak
ing a trip Eist to see relatives there as
soon as lie had collected the insurance
money. _
Foresters Entertain.
An entertainment and ball was given by
Court California No. 7914, A. O. F., on Mon
day evening at the South San Francisco Opera
house. A very interesting programme had
been arranged by the members of the court.
The participants were Mr. i.nd Mrs. heed.
Miss Hunter, Moore brothers, J. Wldmau and
many others. Singing and speaking were the
principal leatures of the programme. At the
conclusion of the enterUlnment the Foresters
and their many lriends spent the rest of the,
evening in Untieing, music being furnished by
the famous Veteran Firemen's band, under
the leadership of J. Fernandez.
NO TIME TO BE
LOST FOR CUBA
It Is Decided to Hold a
Mass- Meeting on
March 13
A Number of Committees Are
Appointed to Arrange
for It.
Great Interest in the Formation of
Leagues at Sacramentr, Vaileja
and Elsewhere.
The Cuban relief committee, which has
recently taKen such decided steps to aid
the struggling patriots in the country
known as the "Pearl of the Antilles," met
last night at the Occidental Hotel. Gavin
McNab officiated as chairman and E. 8.
Salomon as secretary.
It was decided to appoint a number of
committees and arranuc for the holding
of a great mass-meeting in Cuba's inter
eat at an early day.
The committee on resolutions appointed
was as follows: Henry E. Highton, Gavin
McNab, George T. Gaden, Fisher Ames,
F. C. Masters.
Charles M. Shortridge and ex-Judge
Robert Ferral were asked to appoint a
committee ot ten on invitation.
A commitfSe to select speakers was ap
pointed, cjnsi stine of H. E. Highton, E.
S. Sa.'umon, Fisher Ames and F. E. Man
erline.
Committee on ball and arrangements â
G. T. Gaden, A. P. Van Duzer and F.
Jones. On finance, Robert Ferral and
C M. Sbortridge.
The general meeting of the committee
of fifty, appointed lust Matnrday, was
called to meet on Friday evening. A
mass-meeting is to db held Saturday even
ing, March 13, at Metropolitan Hall,
provided the hall can meanwhile be ob
tained. The meeting will, however, be
held at any rate, and it is believed it will
be a very large one.
T. A. Nerney, a traveling man whose
business lakes him to all the principal
towns and cities of the State, called at
Cuban League headquarters yesterday
and told President Jones and Secretary
Mascherini of the great enthusiasm that
is developing in the interior over the
cause of liberty.
At Yisalia he was in conference with a
number of journalists and prominent citi
zens, who were eager io form a Cuban
league and co-operate with the sympa
thizers of this City. Mr. Nerney told them
that it was not men t.-ai were needed
when they talked of raising a company to
go to Cuba, but money, medicine and
munitions of war. When he left Visalia
preparations were being made to form a
permanent organization for the purpose of
raisin ix funds.
At Grass Valley a meeting was held at
which C. F. McGiashan, brigadier-general
of the Uniform RatiK of the Knights of
Pytniasâ a strong Cub-in sympathizer â
delivered an address. The audience was
wrought up to a high pitch of enthusiasm
and unanimously agreed to take an active
part in aiUinq the patriots, even 10 goinp
10 the troubled .sle, should it be neces-
sary.
Mr. Nerney is on the staff of Major-
General James of ttic National Guard and
also on the staff of General McGiashan,
and both he and the latter will join the
Cuoan League.
They will do as much as possible to
spread the spirit of Cuba libre in the in
terior. General McGiashan will probably
be among the speakers at the mass
meeting to be held on the 13th inst.

lines, -.onnect pom s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "bieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low" I
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded |
and accompanied by clou.lv weather and rains. ]
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
roast. When the pressure is high in tha interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south alone the coast, rain Is probable:
but when the "low Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. Wiiha"hl)rh" in tbe vicinity of Idaho, and |
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer |
weather may be expected in summer and colder
â¢ealher in winter. The reverse of these conditions

Financial.
â¢ NEW YORK, N. V., March 3.-The placing of
850.000,000 31/2 per cent guaranteed bonds by the
Lake shore and Michigan Southern Railway com
pany with the >ppyer syndicate for the purpose of
refunding its ou stand! obligations had a most
favorable effect on the market for securities to- I
day. The significance of this important negotia- I
tion was hardly appreciated yesterday, but upon
reflection operators took a more sanguine view of
the matter so far as investment Is concerned thaa
for some time. Naturally enough Vanderbil.
stocks were the first to retiÂ»ct the financiering of
the Lake Shore bonded debt, and when they were
taken freely at steadily advanced prices the whole
list sympathized, with the result that during the
alternoon speculation developed an almost buoy
am tone.
. The demand for the Vanderbi!ts and other lead-
Ing issues was so urgent that the street entirely
â  ignored the cabin advices from London to the
effr-ct that foreign markets were disturbed by the
gravity of the situation in the Levant. he large
sa^es by foreigners ot st. Paul. Louisville and
. v .iishvi. c an.i ether international stocks had no
appreciable effect, and the same is true of the
he&w decrease In earnings reported by the St.
Paul Company for the fourth weeK in February.
It khould be added that leading railroad officials
' expect an Improvement in railroad traffic from
now on.
The announcement by President Hav^mryfr of
' the sugar Refinery company that the annual
dividends on common and preferred stoc^ will be
declared b.- tnÂ« directors at their next meeting led
to large purchases of that sock and started up a
demand from the "shorts" Industrials.
The advance In prices was equal to %@s^Â£ ncr
cent, the latter in Pullman, which ruse to 164.
Omaha common advanced 4y 2 to 57, Consolidated
GÂ»s 3 10 154yÂ». Nickel Plate second preferred
51,4 to 80.4 ana the remainder of the list any
where f 11m 14 to 2 per cent. Jersey Central and
Manhattan were exceptionally heavy In the early
trading, the 'ormet selling down to 93% aDd the
â  la.ter to 853/4, bat they both moved up a couple of
paints during the afternoon in sympathy with the
other markets. Near the clo<e there was a dis
position to take profits, but trie market left off
strong at a reaction of i 'Â« to VÂ» from the highest.
NÂ« changes show an advance of IV4 to 4Vi per

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111. March 3.â Wheat was some
what lower to-day than at the close yesterday, but
a little rally occurred during the first hour, a tem
porary gain of y 2 c being made, against which
there was a reaction to opening prices. The
crowd exhibited a preference for the bull side, a
disinclination to take the "short" side in the face
of prospective damage to he growing crop and of
the fear of po.itical trouble- in Europe being
shown. Closing ones quoted i4d decllue. Re
ceipts at Chicago were 21 cars, and 38.267 busheis
were taken from store. The Northwestern had
21$ cm, against 19U last Wednesday and 434 a
yetr ago.
Late quotations on English consols showed an
early decline, clearance* were light at 76.827
bushels. Offerings became freer as the session
progressed, prices gagging under the pressure until
a fu.l decline of a cent from yesterday was made.
Closing Berlin cables were 34 mark higher. Paris
and Antwerp were not quoted. May wheat opened
from 75U.C to 7534 c. sold between 76ygC and
74:54 c, 1 losing at t j(<Â£7sc. % c under yesterday.
Estimated receipts lor to-morrow 18 cars. No. 2
red spot wheat ranged from 83Â»4c to 86% C, clos
ing about 83%@85%a
CORN â particular characteristic of the corn
market was l.s dullness. shippers and receivers
were doing little if anything, and transactions
were in small lots with the wheat market as a
guide. Liverpool spot corn was 14a higher and
lutures V*<l lower. Receipts were about as ex
pected, 259 can. Local Inspections from store
light at 7850 bushel*. Export clearances were
moderate at. 243,344 bu-he.s. The amallness of
theÂ«e shipments tended to lurther weaken the
market, when posted. May corn opened at 24%' 8 '.
sold at 24V8@24Vic, closing at 2*c bid. 14c under
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 245
cars.
OATSâ Were quite neglected, no interest being
shown. Trade was in small an t unimportant lots
with the average tone of the market strung. Re
ceipts were light at 117 cars and 3975 bushels
were withdrawn from store, clearance] amounted
to 20,000 bushels. May oats cloÂ«ed y g c lower.
Estimated receipts for to-moriow 245 cars.

though they were lying v asleep below,
would i hear the sound whenever a nsb
struct the deck and would rush up to get

sounds. ' The cre w i tried to imitate it in

WITH GYPSIES
Answers the Description
of a Girl Missing
Up North.
Mrs. Prescott Has Set a Watch
on the Camp Pending In
vestigation.
The Blu -Eyed Child Se ms S rangely
Out of Place in the Wretched
Wagon.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 3. )
Some excitement was caused this after
noon by the presence of a handsome
white child among a crowd of low-caste
gypsies.
â¢Four wagons, upon which were loaded
all kinds of what ordinary folfcs call rub
b sh, passed along Twelfth street toward
East Oakland 10-day. Toeach wagon were
harnessed three nondescript beasts which
looked as though they had not seen hay
or a hostler alt their lives. A mass of
mill-soaked gunny sacks and old mat
iea was in each wagon, and out of it
1 i ere protruded a. few poles which were
A^videntiy used as supports for their tents.
On each waron was a family consisting
of man and wife anl, on an average, half
a doien li;tle urchins, with ragged c.otnes,
dirty faces, hatless, unkempt heads. The
little people looked surprised at every
thing they saw, and (he wild horses
jumped every time a streetcar approached,
ill some instances jumping right across
the tracks and exposing the family to
danger.
As" they passed along Twelfth street
there was noticed in one of the wagons a
beautiful tittle blue-eyed white child. It
appeared to be out of place among its
ilirty little companions and attractea
much attention. The fact was reported
to Mr?. Prescott of the Children's Society,
and she at once started out to investigate.
A few week? ago Mrs. Prescott received
a letter Irom a lady irom one of i he north
ern counties informing her that a little
child had been stolen and tnat its disap
pearance was simultaneous with the pass
ing through the town of a band of Mexi
can gypsies.
Mrs. Prescott deemed it inadvisable to
take the cuild trom the gypsies without
proper authority, and so she has placed a
watch over the gypsies so that the ciild
cannot be spirited away, and she is mak
ing inquiry regarding its being in such
company.
LEAVITT ON SALARIES.
Decline* toÃnise the Proposed Schedule
of Pay for the County Assessor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, March 3. \
The inquiry into the salaries of county
officials by the Alameda legislative dele
gation "will not be reopened. An effort
has been made during the paÃt few days
by many friends of Assessor Dal ton, ask
â¢ ing that a raise of $1000 be made on the
salary it is proposed to allow the next As
âº ".--or Assembly Oi.a!\ Clark- tried to get .
i members to sign a call for a caucus, Dut
1 many refused to do so and the project was
/ abandoned.
Assemblyman Frank Leavitt sent a
signed statement to Oakland to-day for
publication. He explained that the dele
gation has tried entirely to forget indi
yiiualsand to do their work in rearrang
* ing salaries in a business-like manner. In
bis statement Mr. Leaviit makes the fol
lowing pointed remarks:
It has been said I am antagonistic to Mr.
Dalton, trie present Assessor. Oil the con
trary, 1 have been very friendly with Mr. Dal- !
ion in the past and 1 know of no reason why I
should not be In the future.
It seems some one has been asking the
friends of the different members of the dele
gation to write pressing letters, urging upon
them th# necessity of paying the next As
sessor, whoever he may be, Â£1000 a year more
ttrun any other county officer shall receive.
The matter already has been decided that
all county officers, with the- exception of the
Auditor, Tux Collector and County Superin
tendent of Schools shall be jt'h'il a net salary
of - . KM). This amount is $1000 a year more
t:.an the salary of State officials. Can it be
faid that the office of Assessor, leaving out of
consideration entirely the person who may 08
elected, Is oi more importance and has greater
responsibilities attacned to it than the office of
Attorney-General of the State of California?
('an it be said the office of Att-esxor is of
more importance and has greater responsibili
ties attached ihan that of th' Mavcr and mem
ber of the Board of Public Works of the city of
Oakland?
I submit to the consideration of the! tax
payers of the city of Oakland that a net salary
of $4000 is sufficient paÂ»- to any man who may
be elected to any county office in thÂ» c unty of
Alamede, or, for that matter, any county in
the State.
AVere we to attempt to reduce the salaries of
the officers during their preent term of office
there might be good grounds for objections,
but under the present conditions, when a 1
other business enterprises are undergoing
â practical ideas ot retrenchment and reform,
county officers and county offices should not
be made an exception to the rule.
Further, the Los Angeles delegation has
placed its Assessor, with nearly twice as much
property to assess, upon a net salary of $3600.
AN ORATOR CONVICTED.
I-^poke on the Street Corner In Violation
ol an Ordinance.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 3.â F. A. Ham
;;:on, the youth who spoke in the street in
order to test the ordinance, was found
puilty this morning by a jury in the Po
lice Court.
t This afternoon Attorney Majors discov
ered that a writ of habeas corpus had been
issued by the Superior Court in the case of
one Sherwood, a Salvation Army worker
who was convicted, but the matter was
allowed to slumber. This afternoon At
torney Gibson appeared before Judge Og
deh and called up the Sherwood writ. It
was denied and Sherwood was remanded.
An appeal to the Supreme Court will be
taken at once. To-morrow is the time set
for passing sentence on Hamilton. Sher
wood is now far away and no one kuows
where he is.

A Thief Hid Them ITnder the Bed of a

OAKLAND, Cal., March 3.â The keeper
oftheiree reading-room on Clay street,
between Seventh and Eighth, is anxious
to hear from the owners of eight umbrel
las which he has in his Keeping. This
morning when he woke he found the um
brellas under his bed. It is supposed that
some enterprising tnief who had been out
on a raid last night placed the siolen
articles under the bed before the curator
locked up for the evening. The thief
evidently thought that the curator would
not notice the umbrellas, and that lie could
come for thorn some time to-day and take
them away without attracting attention.
When found the umbrellas were all wet,
ro that the thief must have taken them
them from the anteroom of some hall.

the present case these goods, wares and
merchandise were of a more or less liquid

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 4, 1897.
CANDIDATES' WOES
ARE INCREASING
Why They Use the Side
Streets in Preference
to Broadway.
Members of Piece Cubs Wear
ing Loud Badges Never Were
So Numerous.
The Saloon-Closing Issue Will Hulp
Ew.ll the Republican
Majority.
Oakland Office San Fbawcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 3. $
The campaign progressed a distinct
step to-day and the political badge made
its appearance. Politics is now lively
and there are not many unemployed ex
press wagons, old bells or snare drums to
be found in the city. Upon the wagons
have been built canvas, multi-storied
houses, on the waving walls of which are
Fate of a Candidate on Broadway.
OAKLAND, Cal, March 3.â One of the candidates for the Council remarked to
day: "It is a lact that tbis has been the worst campaign in the history of the city, I
believe, for piece club?. A man can hardly turn around without being asked for con
tribution-'. But this is not the worst. A man is not only struck by the delegations
from 'independent' cub?, but he is compelled to stand off an army of brazen loafers
who are waiting for him on every corner."
painted all kinds of advice to voters, and
which set forth the merits of candidates
who have not yet exhausted their purity
of election funds.
Inside these structures small boys are
ringing belis or hammering drums, and
blind and deaf and dumb must be the
resident of Oakland who is not reminded
every minute of the day that there is an
election next Monday. As soon as the
first badge was noticed this morning the
desire among candidates to have peoplo
wearing their emblems proved to be in
fectious, ard beiore night there was al
most as big a run on the ribbon houses as
during the week prior to the great McKin
ley parade of last November.
There is no doubt that this method of
adornment will grow rapidly during the
few remaining days of the campaign, and
by Sunday it is very probable that any
willing wearer will be able to obtain
enough badges to make a ma-querade suit.
Candidates are now avoiding Broadway.
The number of j ieee clubs that have
sprung up is something alarming, and if
all the money solicited for "hall rent"
really goes into the landlord's pockets,
the campaign must have proved a verit
able boon to them.
"Workers" are even more numerous,
while the number of friends "of the candi
dates who are anxious for small loans has
never been equaled. Judged by the os
tentatious disiday of "friends" every can
didate should feel absolutely certain of
election. Promises, however, are forced
down to a fine point by the Australian
ballot, and there is no doubt that any
body who was not nominated at the Re
publican convention will have an oppor
tunity next Monday night of contrasting
his small number of Votes whu the multi
tude of promises made by his friends.
The matter of closing the saloons will
help lo bring out a large number of voter*.
A leading candidate on the Democratic
ticket acknowledged to-day that he could
not be elected. â¢'This saloon question,"
he said, "will call out about 1500 voters
who otherwise would not have gone near
the polls. These will swell the Republi
can majority, and that is where we dhall
lose, 'lhe organized campaign made by
those anxious to close the saloons will cer
tainly have the effect of electing the Re
publican ticket."
Among the latest people of prominence
to express themselves as beine in favor ol
closing the open saloons are: Dr. Wendte,
Police Judge Fret V. Wood, Rev. J. E.
Busnneil, Rev. Philip Graif and Professor
T. O. Crawford.
Mayor Davie is kept buoy making re
plies to the attacks of his political ene
mies, and it doing his best to substantiate
the fact that he never did anything which
would imperil the obtaining by the city of
Oakland of the water front.
Councilman BasÂ«ett also has a cam
paign of explanation on hand and so
have several other candidates.
An effort is being made to unify the Re
publican vote in the Fifth Ward. Dr. W.
O. Buckland, the present Councilman, is
running on the Municipal League ticket,
and F. M. Parcells is the regulai Repub
lican nominee. Opposed to them is A.
Fibusii, tha Democratic candidate, and it
is feared that unless one of the two Re
publicans withdraw the ward may return
a Democrat.
The Young Men's Republican Club of
the Seventh Ward has arranged to do
effective work on election-day. They have
dispensed with the idea of holding a
mass-meeting in their ward, as anti-
Sidoon meetings are being held every
nirht. Special efforts are being made to
seenre the full vote of the commuters be
fore they go to San Francisco, and the
secretary of the club has been directed to
ask the clergymen to make the same re
quest in their pulpit announcements on
Sunday.
A. C. Henry wishes to deny the report
that he has retired from the fis*ht. He
was indorsed last night in his candidacy
forMaÂ»or by the United Colored Ameri
can Republican Club. Conservative ob
servers do not think that Mr. Henry can
by any possibility receive 1000 votes.

BERKELEY, Cal., March 3.â The stu

Mr, King; Testified in thn Cage Against
the Chinese Consul.
Both Fong Yuen Hinir, the Chinese
Consul, and King Ow Yang, the Vice-
Consul, were on the witnesi-stand in
United States Commissioner Heacock's
court yesterday in the case of the See Yup
Society against the Consul.
Nothing particular beyond a few unim
portant details of the trouble between the
See Yups and Sam Yups wus drawn out of
the Consul.
Mr. King, as the Vice-Consul is called,
identified some translations of the consti
tution and by-laws of the See Yup Society,
which he said provided for fines on mem
bers who should patronize Sam Yup
stores.
As the Consul for the See Yuds wanted
his own translations the matter went over
until this morning.
Fong Yuen Hing was, as usual, accom
panied by his bodyguard â members of ihe
Woey Leong, the Chinese police of the
Chinese quarter.

specially framed, of certain facts assumed to
be proved, for the purpose of the inquiry.
Sucn questions leave it for the jury to decide
in the first case, whether the evidence is true
or not, and in the second case, whether the
particular facts assumed are or are not proved."
Consideration of Jurymen
But, as in criminal cases, and particularly
in cases of cap tal crime, the law is reluctant
to deny a defendant a full consideration of nis
points oecause of technical errors or omissious
of his counsel, upon whom he must rely, we
pass to toe consideration of the proposition
that the hypothetical question and its answer
were not the subject of expert evidenceâ a
ground of objection not presented to the trial
Judge. Upon this proposition the deiense is
undoubtedly correct. A juryman would be
absolutely deficient in common-sense and
common "knowledge who did not know that
the way to keep au inanimate objsct in a given
position would be to supDort it by Drops or
stays in that position. And the physician's
answer gives expression to this when he says:
"That is what I as an individual would do."
There was here no question of professional,
scientific or technical skill or knowledge. But
the question and answer were absolutely with
out injury. Not all matters improperly made
the suDject of expert evidence work harmful
erro r.
Where the ultimate conclusion is one to be
reached by the jury Itself from the facts be
fore i t, and so-called expert evidence is allowed
winch, presents to a jury a cone usion other
than that to which tney might have arrived,
the admission of this improper evidence is
tantamount to a declaration by the court that
they may set aside their exclusive right of
judging, and accept the judgment ol the ex
pert. In such cases ii jury is apparent. But
it frequently happens tnat under the form of
expert evidence answers are given which are
soclexrlya part oi common knowledge that
no inj.iry could have n suited. The question
under consideration is one of them. Had tne
witness been asked: ''It you throw a stone
imo a pond of water, will it float or sink? If
you strike a man on the head with an ax, will
it injure or benefit him?" while the questions
do not call for expert evidence, their answers,
particularly when, as in this case, they are
correctly given, could in the nature of tuiuca
have worked no harm.
The Chisel and the Hammer.
The defense showed by Police Officer Rey
nolds that two days after the discovery of tne
body he found a chisel and hammer in the
pastor's study in the church, and that he
tried the chHel upon certain marks on the
belfry door. He testified: '-My rero. lection is
that there were two marks 1 tried to ti . the
chisel to. There was no mart that fitted it
exact. y; there was a littl? ilay; you could
move the chisel up and down. I could not
teil if there was any more play than would or
dinarily have occurred in using a chisel for
prying. â¢ * â¢ I saw a mark on the jamb of
thnt door as is at some time a blow had been
struck with a hammer. * â¢ â¢ At some time
the hammer wus tried In that mark." The
di-feuse then introduced the hammer and
chisel in evidence. The p'aiu purport of this
evidence was to direct suspicion to the minis
ter. In lebuttal the beliry door and jamb
were offered in evidence by tho prosecution,
after testimony from the officer that they were
in the same condition as when previously he
bud made the test, saving for the absence of
the lock plate. The evidence wns permissible.
Tne witness was then asked to see if he could
fit the chisel to tne marks, It was objected'
that it was for the jurors to sitlsfy themselves
upon this matter without the intervention of
the witness. It is true, the jurors cou d have
made the experiment to their satisfaction
without the aid of the officer; but he, having
testified to his former experiment, the prose
cution was entitud to have him repeat it be
fore the jury. The result would b- as tne jury
determin-d, either to support or disprove his
oral testimony.
The Defendant's Testimony.
The defendant offered himself as a witness
and told wiih mucn circumstantiality and de
tail how be iiKd spent his time upon April 3.
Many objections were interposed to ques
tions propounded him upon cross-examina
tion. A minute examination fails to disc.ose
any error in "he court's ruling. The questions
allowed and the scope of the cross-examina
tion are strictly within the rule expressed in
People vs. Ua.lagher, 100 Cai.. 466. One or
two of the rulings whould perhaps receive
more particular consideration, 'ihe defend
ant testified upon d.rect examination that
when he parted wMh Blanche Lamont upon
tho morning of April 3 it was the last time
that he ever saw her dead or alive, and when
Hskei upon cross-examination if he had not
prepared a statement which was put into a
sea.cd envelope addressed to his counsel with
me instruction: "To be opened if I am con
victeiimd to be returned unopened if I am
not convicted," to this aua several like ques
tions objections were Interposed, upon the
ground tnat the statement, if made, was privi
leged. The court ruled, and properly, that trie
questions were preliminary. It was the fact
and not ti e contents of the statement which
was ihe subject of inquiry, and no effort was
made to extort from the witness any informa
tion of the latter.
The court further declared that, if the people
failed to follow this preliminary inquiry by
propernroofs.lt would on motion strike out
the evidence. The witness answered that he
had made no such statement, and there the
matter rested, presumptively to the advantage
ot tho defendant, certaimy not to his i^ jury.
From the fact that no motion was maae to
strike out the evidence, it must be concluded
that the defendant acquiesced in its
remaining In the case. (Coderberg vs.
Robison, 100 Cal., 93.) The court was
further just. fled in its ruling by the
consideration that it could not foretell the line
of proof wuich the people might take in re
buttal. The conterits of the statement, while
privileged matter between the client and at
torney and all wtio had acquired knowledge
of it through a relation of legal confidence,
would no: be privileged if known 10 one who
had acquired nis knowledge under other cir
cumÃtauces. The court could not know that
it was not some such evidence, which would
be proposed at the proper time.
Carrie Cunningham's Story.
The prosecution then asked the witness,
with specifications of time, place and circum
stance, if he had not told Miss Carrie Cun
ningham that he saw Blanche Lamont upon
the secuud landing ana that she was mur
dered upon the second landing. This was in
icbuttal of defendant's testimony that he had
never seen the girl aiier the morning of April
3. It Is argued by appellant's counsel that
the communication, if made, was privileged.
But, considering that Miss Cunninchain was a
newspaper reporter, and is not shown to have
been the wile or to have stood to the de
fendant in any other relation of legal confi
dence, the claim scarcely merits comment.
Miss Cunningham, called in rebuttal, was
asked whether defendant did or did not make
to her the statement above mentioned. It is
asserted that the allowance by the court of
these questions vas a "gross outrage" and
"bore down to the ground all the rules of
evid-nce." It was strictly rebuttal evidence
by way of Impeachment under well-settled
rules of law and under the express declara
tion of section 2052 of the Code of Civil
Procedure.
The foregoing are all of the alleged errors In
receiving and rejecting evidence which call
for especial comment.
11. .1. McCoy In Contempt.
It came Jo the knowledge of the court dur
ing the progress of the trial tnat one H. J.
McCoy iiad said to a juror: "If you don' t hang
him (meaning defendant) we will hang you."
For this flagrant contempt McCoy was at once
cited to appear. An examination was held.
By this it was disciofed that toe language was
used jocularly and without a serious signifi
cance. At least so the juror to whom it was
Hddressed testified that he reci-ivd and un
derstood it For this contempt McCoy was
prompt. y and properly punished. The pro
ceeiincs were conducted in the presence of
thejur.-. This circumstance is now for the
first time charged as error. Doubtless had the
defense desired the jury excused durin2 the
investigation the court w"ould have acceded
to the request, but no such sugpestion was
made. We fail to see how the defendant could
have beeu Injured by this. The mode punued
we think had a salutary rather than malign
effect. The claim that defendant could have
been prejudiced in the minds of tne jury is
completely answered by the tacts; first, that
it was not the defense which either instituted
or conducted the contempt proceedines; and
second, by the affirmative declarations of each
of the jurors under oath that be reached his
verdict irom a consideration of the evidence
in the case and from that alone.
Fnirnem of the District Attorney.
\Ve perceive no abuse of his office or unfair
ness to defendant in the argument of the Dis
trict Attorney. In showing an empty box to
il.ustrate the amount of gas,which under the
evidence would leak in a given time, botn
the District Attorney and Judge were carefu
to inform the jury that the box was not an
exhibit; that no proof of its capacity was be
lore them, and tlmfr they were not 10 accept
the Dlstr ct Alton. ey's statement as evid nee.
The box was used purely for purposes of ii
lusiration, and while the practice is nÂ»t com
mended, its exhibition to the jury could have
worked no injury in this case under Me cau
tions of the court, and in strictness could no

more be regarded as error than would have
been the like employment of any ordinary
physical object in the courtroom.
Error is assigned for the court's refusal to give
certain instructions proposed by the defense,
in number thirty-Lax. Argument is ad-iressed
to but few of them. Tho^e will bo considered.
The ethers not argued have not been over
looked, but they either contain manifest er
r rs of law, or are so completely covered by
others given of the court's own notion
that it may with safety be concluded that
counsel's failure to discuss them is a tacit
recognition that as to them no error was com
mitted.
Technical Points of Law.
Of the proposed instructions, No. 6 was re
fused because substantially given in the
charge of the court. It was so given. No. 8
deals with the danger to be avoided and the
caution to be exercised in reaching a conc.u
sion upon circumstantial evidence. Uoon
this subject also ihe jury was fully and fairy
advised by the court.
The propositions of lav contained in the
first portion 01 No. 10 were given by the court
with more elaboration and exactness than ap
pear in the proposed instruction. It was not
error for the c -urt to decline to give the last
portion. It is quite true that the law never re
quires the s*cr flee of a victim. But the jury
nad bee;i carelully instructed as to their
duties, and had been repeatedly told that un
less upon clear and cogent proof, satisfying
their minds beyond a reasonable aouQt, they
believed defendant guilty, it was their duty
to a< quit him. It was not incumbent upon
the court to instruct ttie jury, as matter of
law, that "it is safer to en in acquitting."
Proposed instructions 11-16, upon the sub
ject of alibi, were fully embraced iv those
given by me court, as was also the law upon
the matter of identification. Of the remain
ing instructions the same may be said.
It may here be noted that the appellant does
not make serious comnlaint thnt any of the
instructions actually given by the court were
erroneous in point of law, but contend* that
iv some instances the propositions which he
sought to have laid beiore the jury were not
adequately presented. The jury, however,
was t.bly, carefully and elaborately instructed,
and we can discern no just ground of com
plaint in this regard.
A fair and Impartial Trial.
The ground* for a new trial presented by de
fendant have for the most part been covered
by what has been said. One of them, how
ever, still remains for consideration. Tnis is
that the proceedings were so conducted as to
deprive defendant of bis constitutional right
to a fair and impartial trial. Under this head
it is Maimed that by tne repeated pub ica
lions In the newspapers of S*n Francisco pub
lic feeling was unjustly aroused to bitter hos
tility against the defendant; that witnesses
who would otherwise have given valuable tes
timony in his favor were so intimidated that
either they refused to testify or in testifying
gave colorless or worthless evidence, and that
the jury itself, impelled by fear, yielded to the
public clamor and demand that tlie de
fendant should be convicied. Many hun
dreds of pages of the trauscript are given over
to a presentation of the newspaper articles
complained of.
The murder of B'anche Lamont was a crime
of so atrocious a character that the commun
ity was greatty aroused. The ghastly and sen
sational leutures were seized upon wi h avid
ity by the newspapers, and daily paraded and
exploited before their horrified readers.
Wnen Durrant was arrested for the crime
theiewas no reservation of judgment upon
their part, but they proceeded with unanimity
to hold him up to the public as the guilty
man. During ill* trial of the case ti-.ey vied
with each other in sensational discoveries and
prophecies concerning new evidence and
strange witnesses. They maintained thro-agh
ont the attitude which they originally as
sumed, and from first to last continued to
treat the defendant as the undoubted crim
inal. All this the record presented by appel
lant abundantly establishes.
Opinion of a I â¢â¢mm unity.
But, where a community is deeply stirred
over the commission of an appalling crime
aDd the public and the publfc prints are
clamoring that punishment shall be meted
out for It, unless we must say thai under such
ciicumstances, as matter of law, a defendant
cannot have the trial guaranteed him by
the constitution, such a. showing does not
conclude the question. Under these circum
stances ah men do not forsake reason; some
still preserve a dispassionate judgment, and
if it be made to appear that the defendant
was tried by a jury of such, uninfluenced by
aught save the evidence, then in this regard
none of h*s rights have been violated. After
rigorous examination by prosecution and de
fense it appears that such a jury was obtained
without exhausting more than three-fifths of
the defendant's peremptory challenges. Each
juror makes solemn affidavit that he did
not at any time- during the trial of the
cause and while he was impaneled and sworn
as a juror read or hear read any of the articles,
statements or comments published in nny
of the newspapers concerning this case; that
he at all times heeded the admonition of the
court, given at each adjournment thereof,
and was at no time influenced in any way,
shape or manner by auy extraneous matter
whatever while a jumr, either by newspapers
conversation or pub.ic sentiment â if any t>uch
sentiment existed; that he receiv<d no im
pression as to the defendant's guilt or inno
cence outside of the courtroom, but decided
the case, after deliberation, solely according
to the law and tne evidence, to the beat of his
ability and understanding, and not other
wise.
It cannot be said that there was any error in
refusing a new trial under such a showing.
Witt eases Not Intimidated.
The claim that witnesses for the defense
were Intimidated and kept from testifying is
not supported. It was expected to prove by a
witness, Clark, inato.i the afternoon of April
3 ho saw uoon a M-irket-street car Blanche
Lamont with a young man not the defendant.
Clark was In one of the Eastern States during
the trial and his fier'Osition was there taken.
It was to the effect that ha saw Blanche
Lamont and a younz man, not answering taÂ«
description of defendant, together upon a car
upon a day in the latter part ot March or the
first pÂ«rt ol April, but the date he could not
fix with positiveness. He said that he believed
that he had told h lawyer that it was upon
April 3. but that subsequent consideration
had convinced him that he was mistaken in
this. There is h^re no suggestion of undue
iniiue> C 3 or intimidation.
The witness (Lenahan) called for the defense
testified from all that appears precisely as the
defense expected.
Mrs. Monnier, it is claimed, was expected to
testify tnat upon the afternoon of April 3 she
saw a'young man, whom she would identity as
the defendant, enter the Emmanuel Church
alone; tha'-, because of newspaper publica
tions and interviews with her, her husband
became afrtid that his business would be
injured, an 4 between fear and auger so talked
with his wife, nnd had others do so, "that she
became uncertain as to the time." This
declaration is made upon the informiition and
beiief of defendant. It is not supported nor
corroborated. Even the source of affiant's in
formation is not mentioned. It does not ap
pear that Mrs. Monnier was not at all times
within reach ot process, yet no attempt was
made to introduce her testimony. This show
ing is certainly insufficient to call for a re
versal of the case.
The Judgment Affirmed.
Upon a consideration of the whole case we
discern no error to the prejudice of any of the
substantial rights of defendant, wherefore the
judgment and order appealed from are af
tirmed. Henshaw, J.

McFaeland, J.
Eugene N. Deuprey of counsel for Dur
rani said last evening that be had no
seen the opinion, bat that it was by no
means final. Durrant's attorneys, after
considering the decision, would at ones
petition the Supreme Court for a rehear
ing. The fact that Chief Justice Beatty
had declined to sign the opinion might
prove of value to the defense, and his
opinion, when it was handed down, would
be closeiv considered. Then there would
be a constitional point which would un
doubtedly De carried to the United States
Supreme Court.
Mr. Deuprey admitted that the decision
had been a surprise to him, especially
that it had been reached so early, consid
ering the voluminous character of the evi
d nee.
Senator Dickinson, when interviewed
by a Call correspondent in Sacramento
last evening on the subject of the refusal
of the Supremo Court to grant Durrant a
new trial, said:
"I am not prepared to state at this time
what further steps I will take in this mat
ter. In fact, this is the first intimation
which I have received that a reiusal for a
new trial has been made by the Supreme
Court, and if such be the case, it would be
simply impossible for me to come to any
decision for future action until I have
seen this decision. It may possibly be
that I shall petition for a rehearing in the
entire matter, but, as I said before, I can
not possibly at this time state what action
I will take.'J

The crowd that witnessed the toe-of-war
last evening was the largest since tha
commencement of the tournament.
Much disappointment resulted over the
announcement that the Scotch team had
refused to pull unless it had the privilege
of naming an anchorman. This the
Swedes objected to. Tne referee, Judge
Campbell, decided, after inquiring into
the matter, thai the Swedish team was
right, and he gave it the decision by de
fault
The United States and Norwegian teams
were the first to put in an appearance last
evening. The United States team won a
comparatively easy victory in 2 mm.
25 sec.
The newsboys of Powell and Kearny
streets made up a team, and at the request
of Judge Campbell, they were given a
chance to try their strength and stamina
in rope pulling. The event created no end
of amusement. The contest was won by
the Powell-street boys in 9 mm. 2 sec.
The Italian and German teams had a
Jfery spirited struggle. The betting was
110 to $5 in favor of the Germans. The
hnish-shot declared the Italians winners
in, 9 minutes 43 seconds.
The next event was a contest between
the Canadian and Danish teams, but the
anchorman of the Canadian team, James
Dunning, refused to pull for reasons best
known to himieif.
The Judge announced that the Canadian
team decided to pull with only seven men
as against eight, and then the captain of
the Danish team refused to pull with the
handicap and ordered one of his men out
of the team, - making the struggle an equal
tuing.
The Canadians won the event, after a
most bitter struggle, in 6 mm. 36 sec.
The last event of the evening was a
meeting between the Irish and French
teams.
The betting was 10 to 4 in favor of the
Irish team, which won in 17 miv. 31 sec.

J;ter Case Is Not Parallel in
Any Respect.
Judjre Hebbard yesterday handed down
a decision that is of unusual importance
to those who are interested in the welfare
of the public schools of San Francisco, the
intent being to dec'are that Reginald H.
Webster is the legally elected Superintend
ent of Public Schools in this City, and
that Madison Babcock, who still holds
over, is in fact a mere usurper. The case
was submitted for decision upon the fol
lowing agreed statement of facis:
It is hereby stipulated and agreed by and
between th 2 respective parties heretoforeâ
plaintiff and defendant -"that on the 14th
day of October, 1895. the office of Superin
tendent of Schools of the City and County of
San Francisco became vacant by reason of the
death of Andrew J. Moulder, who was elected
to fill said office on November 6, 1894, for the
term of four years, commencing on the first
Monday in January, 1895.
â¢â¢That on the 24th day of October, 1895, the
Board of Eiucatloii for the said City and
County of San Francisco appointed Madison
Babcock, defendant herein, to fill said vacancy
until the regular election then next following:.
"That on November 3, 1896, there was held
a general election throughout the State of
California and at the same time and in con
junction with said general election there was
held a municipal election in and for and
throughout the City and County of San Fran
cisco.
"That the electors who voted at said general
and municipal election were duly qualified
and registered electors of said City and
County. â¢
. "It is admitted that said municipal election
was proclaimed, held and conducted in the
mode required by law and was in all respects
n valid election, except with respect to the
following matter, to wit: whether the time of
â¢said election was a proper and lawful time for
the election of a Superintendent of Schools of
the City and County of Snn Francisco, as to
which matter defendant maces no admission.
"That the proclamation of said election in
cluded in the list of officers to be voted for at
Eaid election one Superintendent of Senoois
for an unexpired term.
"That at said election Reginald H. Webster,
the relator herein, and three others appeared
upon the official ballots used at said election
us candidates for said office of Superintendent
Of Schools.
"That said relator, Webster, received the
highest number of votes given for the office of
Superintendent of Schools at said election.
Commenting on this provision of the
consolidation act Jpdie Hebbard says:
Defendant, notwithstanding the apparently
plain meaning of this section, contend-* that
the recent case oi the People vs. Bndd, 45 I'ac.
Rep,, 1000, has made it lawful for him to hold
tne office of Superintendent of Schools for
Moulder's full term, to wit: until the election
in 1898, and he relies solely upon this case to
gupport hil contention.
The case of the People vs. Budd, decided by
ihe Supreme Court, September 3, 1896, was an
app ication for a writ of mandat; to compel
the Governor to include Hi his proclamation
for the election to be held November 3. 1896,
Â» call to fill the office of Lleuienant-"Governor
lor the untxpired term ot Spencer G. Miliard,
deceased, ihe respondent having filled the va
cancy caused by the death of Spencer G. Mil
lard by the appointment of Will, am T. Jeter.
The Supreme Court denied the writ, holding
that under article V, section 8 of the constitu
tion, when a vacancy occurs in the office of
Lie \i tenant-Governor the Governor has power
to fill the same by appointment, and that
when there is no other special constitutional
provision and no statutory enactment as to
the time such appointee shall hold, fueh as
"to the end of the next Legislature" or "'until
the next election of the people," the eppointee
may hold the office till the next gubernatorial
election.
After qnoting from the language of the
Supreme Court's decision in the case of
the People vs. Budd Judge Hebbard says:
The reasonings ana conclusions reached by
the Supreme Court in the above-mentioned
case ere against the respondent here rather
than for him. By the section of the consoli
dation net, section 14, above cited, there is
lawful authority for the holding of an election
for the office of Superintendent of Schools at
the time when it was held, November 3, 1896.
and when both the complainant Webster ana
the respondent Babcock were candidates be
fore the people for election to that office.
Section 14 says in unambiguous language
â¢nd concerning this very office, that the vaÂ»
cancy shall bo filled by the people at the regu
lar election then next following after the ap
pointment made or after ihe vacancy created,
and it is concerted that the election held
November 3, 1890, was a general election
throughout the Slate <d California; thnt. ex
cept so far as it concerns this particular office,
â which is the question to be herein determined,
It was regularly conducted in the mode re
quired by lav.- and it was valid.
It must also b^Â» comeded that it was the
"then next" election following the appoint
ment of the respondent, rtabcock. That it
â was regular also as to the office of the Super
intendent of Pehoosmust be held under the
raid section 14 of the consolidation act, and
under the case of Ford vs. Tillson, 53 Cai., 701.
It 1* the general policy of the law that pub
lic officers shell be chosen by the sovereign
power of tnis Government â the people.
Therefore, upon the general principles of
our Government in relation to the election of
jiublic office:*, and upon the positive provi
sions of the consolidation act in relation to
tho particular office of Superintendent of
Behools, it follows that Repinald 11. Webster,
complainant herein, having received the
highest number of votes for said office at the
eection held on November 3, 1896, end not
the respondent. Madison Babcock, he, the said
Reeinald H. Webster, if rightly entitled to said
office of Superintendent of School..
An order was made that Webster be put
In possession of the office, and it is sup
posed that be will take possession at once,
that being the rule generally observed
whether there is an appeal to the Supreme
Court or not.
OTHERS ARE CONCERNED.
Dr. Raaran, Secretary Welch and
the Deputy School Superin
tendent Anxious.
Mr. "Webster may take possession of the
office of Superintendent of Schools to-day.
He did not visit the rooms of the Board of
Education yesterday in the absence of Mr.
Babcock, who was in Sacramento. Last
evening Mr. Webster said that he will
confer with hi? attorney, Judge Garbcr,
bffore he mnkes a formal demand for the
office upon Mr. Babcock. It is Mr. Web-
Bier'f opinion, however, that he is de facto
and de iure the Superintendent of Schools
under the Superior Court decision of yes
terday. "1: an appeal should be taken to
the Supreme Court," said Mr. Webster.
''I think that, the Superior Court being a
court of competent jnrisdic.ion, I must be
considered the su)Â»erinfendent until the
Supreme Court shall decide otherwise."
The decision in favor of Mr. Webster
has raised interesting questions concern
in;; other officials connected with the
Hcnool Department. Mr. Babcock, as
puperiniendent, apnointed Charles W.
Welch secretary and Dr. Ragan a mem
ber of the board, the appointments being
ratified by the board. He also appointed
Miss English as his deputy. All those
oih'ials arc concerned in the events of the
next day or two. Mr. Beanston, former
secretary of the board, mny also take a
hamt in the proceedings on the ground
that Mr. Hancock, not being legally the
(Superintendent, had no power to appoint
atucces^sorto him. There are alÂ«o ques
tions concerning the salary of Mr. Bab
pock and other salaries since the Board of
Election Commissioners issued a certifi
cate of election to Mr. Webster to bede
cided. Tbe general expectation is that
Mr. Webster will visit the City Hall as
Suprintendent of Schools this afternoon.

SUTRO WILL
GIVE DEEDS
The Grand Boulevard Is
Now a Reasonable
Certainty.
GOLDEN GATE PARK TO
INGLESIDE.
Unemployed to Be Set to Work
to Create a Beautiful
Drive.
TO BE PLANTED WITH THREE
ROWS OF TREES.
Oace Begun It W:ll Never Eni Till
the Boulevard From Fort Point
to San Jose Is Rializ.d.
Ex-Mayor Sutro will appear before the
Street Committee of the Board of Super
visors to-day and subniit for consider
ation a deed of the land necessary to carry
forward the contemplated boulevard. The
acceptance of this deed is the final step to
be taken preliminary to setting the un
employed to work, and is the last techni
cality which stands in the way of that
much wished for consummation.
Mr. Sutro wiil deed a strip of land 100
feet wide and about 5000 feet long, com
prising altogether about thirteen acre*.
The strip will connect with that which
has already been deeded by the Spring
Valley Water Company. These two gifts
or concessions will enable a connection to
be made from, the park to the Trocadero
road.
What is contemplated to be done by the
Driving Association is to construct a road
100 feet wide from the park along Seventh
avenue and tne old Almshouse road to the
in'et on the Trocadero road.
It will pass through the lands of Mr.
Sutio from tne â¢south, and of the Alms
house tract southerly through the Italian
gardens on the westerly side of the so
called Italian Hill to the Trocadero. This
makes a much shorter road to reach the
southernmost part ot the City, and re
duces the grades of the old roads to gen
erally excellent grades. Mr. Sutro will
ni-o give the rock necessary to macadam
ize it in good form.
It is proposed, the road being built, to
plant it with a triple row of trees, which
will always serve as a wind break, as well
as forming an attractive feature of the
road itself.
This work is being enthusiastically
advocated by the Driving Association,
or, speaking more particularly, by Con
O'Connor in its behalf. It means the
eventual extension of a sulendid and
beautiful protected drive to Ingleside.
Beginning at Golden Gate Park at Sev
enth av-.-nue, it extends in a straight line
T.OO feet wide for a mile.
AiN street it joins the road on the West
side of Lake Honda and thence by the
Almsiiouse road to the Trocadero and will
finally connect v/ith the Ocean House
voad which leads on to tne ocean and
thence to the park again.
The completion of this much must
naturally revive the project for the exten
sion of this boulevard southerly to San
Mateo and thence on to San Jo-e.
On the other hand, it is the ultimate
purpos* to connect at the junction of Sev
enih avenue with the park, extend on
through the park to First avenue, and
tnence northerly through the Presidio to
Fort Point, completing one of the most
extensive and beautiiui drives to be found
anywhere on this continent.
'ihe beginning will be most auspicious.
It will set a multitude of men to work who
are now in distress for lack of it and when
completed it will be a joy forever to the
men and women of fleet horses and fleet
wheels.
CANCELING OEDÂ£ES.
No More Opium Will Be Imported From

The special treasury agents who held up
all of the recent large imnortations of
opium from China are hard at work pre
paring the case and statements of lacts
which they will present to the United
States District Attorney's office in an ef
fort to havo the drug confiscated.
The point on which they will rely to
convince the court that they have taken a
legal step to prevent the irregular im
portation of the drug is a nice one, in
volving the reiaiiun of importer and agent.

A FLIM-FLAM GAME.
B. Meyers Arrested for Grand Larceny
on Complaint of Mrs. Laura
Locks.
B. Myers, a guest of the New Washing
lon Hotel, was arrested yesterday by
Policemen Ryan, ODea and Cassin on a
charge of grand larceny. The complain
ing witness is Mrs. Laura Locks, 122 Turk
street.
Mr. Locks saw an advertisement in a
morning paper en February 8 asking for a
loan of $500 on a chattel mortpajie. She
answered it and Meyers called upon her.
He displayed a goid watch, chain and
locket, worth about $100, diamond ring
worth $150, diamond scarf Din worth $50,
and a pair of diamond earrings worth
$300, and said he wan tea the $500 loan on
them.
Mrs. Locks took the diamond jewelry to
Expert Gottschalk, on California street,
and ne appraised their value. She re
turned home with Meyers and offered him
a loan of $300 on the articles. An agree
ment was signed by them and Meyers put
the articles in an envelope and handed
them to Mrs. Locks, receiving the $300.
After he left Mrs. Locks examined the
diamond earrings and, suspecting they
had been tampered with, she hurried to
Expert Gottschalk and found they were
paste, Meyers having, it is alleged,
adroitly substituted the paste ones for the
real diamonds.
THE LENTEN SEASON.
Archbishop Riordan Preaches on the
I'uti.x of Sacrifice.
The opening cf the solemn Lenten season
was marked by appropriate devotions in
the various City churches yesterday.
At St. Mary's Cathedral Archbishop
Riordan preached to a large congregation
on the duties of the season, more particu
larly emphasizing the lightness of the
regulations and the propriety of self-sacri
fice on the part of all on the lines of
charity and self-purification. He argued
for no mere formal observance, but actual
self-denial.
In the evening at the Church of the
Advent the Episcopal churches united in
a service peculiarly appropriate to Ash
"Wednesday.
DENIES THE CHARGE.
H. T. Smith, Insurance Agent, Arrested
for Embezzlement.
H. T. Smith, an insurance agent on Cali
fornia street, was arrested yesterday after
noon on a warrant charging him with
felony embezzlement. The complaining
witness is S. Anthony, who alleges that
Smith collected some money for him and
lailed to hand it over.
Smith said there was nothing in the
case. He bad befriended Anthony on
several occasions by procuring employ
ment for him, and this was his reward.
He admitted that he collected some money
for Anthony after considerable trouble
and correspondence, but said Anthony
owed him more than the sum collected.
Smith was released on his own recog
nizance by Justice of ihe Peace Groezinger.

TOO RAPID
"Courier" Oakley Succumbs
to the Effects of
Alcohol.
COMEDY AND TRAGEDY
OF CHAMPAGNE.
His Countess a Woman Who
Joined Him in New Or.'cans
for a Frolic.
SHE QUIETLY DEPARTS FOR
THE SOUTH.
The Dead Man Was Wealthy and a
Prominent Banker and Broker
in Pittsburg.
Death ridinz on a chariot of champagne
was the unwelcome guest that rung down
the curtain on the comedy John M. Oak
ley and his Countess Espanola essayed at
the Palace Hotel.
The unbidden stranger arrived early
JOHN M. OAKLEY, the Dead Pittsburg Eanker and Broker.
yesterday morning to claim the PittFburg
banker. The lights went out quietly and
suddenly, for Oakley had gone so far on
the yellow-label road that when the sum
mons came he could not even make an ef
fort to turn back. With his going went
his countess. The woman, around wnora
the wine-seared brain ot her companion
had woven the imagery of a princess, de
serted her prince nimost tbe same mo
ment the life left him and stole away to
New Orleans by the first train.
Oakley's tragic death has stripped much
of the mystery from bis escapade and all
the romance from the woman who accom
panied him. It pleased the Pittsburg man
to style her his princess or his countess as
the idea pieased. Woman-like she ac
cepted the homage and the story ia almo t
told. He would take her around the world
with him as a daughter of royal blood and
no one might Lift the ma-k. It was a
champagne creation â born when the dia
monds were sparkling in the glass, before
the eye bad lost its luster and before the
brain had become sodden with over ex
haustion. Even in death the romance was
vivid with the man, but the fall of the
shadow put an end to the masquerade as
as far as the woman was concerned. 'Then
she was neither princess nor countess, but
a plain product of the prosaic world of New
Orleans, a grass widow, or something else
as pleased her fancy, and a traveling com
panion to the man of money, or anything
else the world may choose to call it.
It was in New Orleans that he gathered
in his countess. Tbe acquaintance ex
tended back a year, for, accor.iine to the
woman's own story, it was on last Good
Friday that she first met him. It was a
chance acquaintance to some extent, and
a passing one, so she declares for herself.
The banker at that time was about to run
through Mexico and California and in
vited her to accompany him on his jaunt.
Ihis time he was more successful. The
prospect of a trip around the world was
an alluring one. And when Oakley left
New Orleans a week ago Tuesday for Los
Angeles his countes3 was booked to
accompany him on nis travels.
They cnlled in the champagne to make
the time fly merrily. With him it was
the beginning of the tragedy that led to
the Morgue, for he was what is known in
club parlance as a "periodical."
The two arrived in Los Angeles on Fri
day last and registered at the Westmin
ster. The wine was sizzling rhythmically
in his brain, and it was shortly after their
departure tor San Francisco on Saturday
morning that he crowned his woman a
countess and declared himself her faithful
servitor or courier.
By the time they had arrived here he
had decided she must have a valet and a
maid in addition 10 & courier. He pro
vided apartments for the maid and the
vulet that were not in the way of a $20 a
day suite of rooms at the Palace Hotel.
His next move was to hedge his royal
bird with the divinity and seclusion of
oaken door-.
Monday afternoon Oakley and his com
panion tooK a drive to the Cliff House.
The man was then beginning to wilt under
the tremendous alcoholic pressure he had
subjected himself to and his hand and his
tonuue were alke unsteady. A forebod
ing of the end must then have presented
itselt for he informed the woman then
that the last debauch he was on he barely
escaped with his life. On their return to
tbe City he had arrived at the period of
fear and with the magnanimity that had
characterized him all through his trip, he
purchased a return ticket by New Orleans
for his countess, "for her protection," he
explained, "in case anything might haD
pen."
All day Tuesday Oakley spent wallowing
in champagne. About' 8 o'clock in the
evening he retired to his room and almost
immediately collapsed. The woman sum
moned Dr. George H. Martin, who labored
with him for two hours. Dr. Martin left
his apartments at 10 o'clock only to be
summoned by the nurse an hour later,
but at midnight the banker was dead.
Almost his last words were a request for
Champagne.
The woman at first took his death appa-
rently to heart. She said little of herself
beyond that she was born in Richmond,
Va. The she shed hsr title of Countess
ior plain Mrs. \Vorth, or any other name
people might decide to call her, and took
the afternoon train for New Orleans.
"New Orleans is my home," *he said,
"and there is wber<> I first met Mr. Oak
ley. People may call me what they please;
for the present T am Mrs. Worth. I do
not care to give my true name, for the rea
son I am divorced and do not want to
bring others into this unfortunate affair.
"It was drink that killed him. It was
champaene ever since we left New Or- j
leans. Had I thought he was such a hard i
drinker I would never have set out with
him. Poor Jack; it is too bad," and the
champagne countess went South.
Oakley's body was removed to Gray's
undertaking parlors only to fall into
the custody of the Coroner later
in the day. His baggage was
taken in charge by the hotel officials
and before the day was over was the
cause of much friction between Manager
Kirkpatrick and Coroner Hawkins. Depu
ty Coroner McCormack made an official
demand for it from assistant Manager
Warren at noon only to meet with a blunt
refusal to give it up^ Dr. Hawkins him
self then requested its delivery to him,
and was fqually unsuccessful. The Cor
oner then resorted to a search warrant,
which was placed in the hands of Deputy
McCormack and Policeman Walsh for ser
vice. Manager Kirkpatrick was still
unrelenting. The deputy was directed to
search every room in tbe big hotel with
the desired result.
The dead man's effects were given to
the police department, pending an order
for their delivery to the Coroner by Jus
tice of the Peace Barry this morning.
An autopsy was held on Oa^ey last
night. It was found that it was a plain
case of alcoholic poisoning.
There will be an inquest to-day, after
which tbe remains will be shipped to Al
leghany City, the home of the dead man's
parents.
The Countess yon Schlutterbach of Ger
many, with her unc c, Colonel Benzoni of
tue army, called at the hoiel yesterday
afternoon to make some inquiry about
the unfortunate man. He had mentioned
a diiy or two before his death thai he knew
the Countess and this was published in an
interview with him. The Countess f-aid
this was true, and added in detail that in
Mny last, when she and a Iriend were
coming on the train from Los Anpeles to
this City, Mr. Oukley was on board and
became acquainted with herself and
friend, as he did with several other pas
sengers.
The dead man is said to be worth in tbe
neighborhood of $1,000,000, made prin
cipally in banking and stockbroking. In
1894 he retired from business and an
nounced his intention of devoting the re
mainder of his lifd to pleasure. He is sur
vived by a wife and 16-year-old son. who
live at 711 Lilac street, East End, Pitts
burp.
A dispatch from his home last night
says:
The alleged Countess Espanola, who was
traveling incognito and whoso courier Mr.
Oakley ostensibly was, is thought here to be
a Pittsburj; woman. About the time Mr. Oak
ley left Pittsburg, on Februnry 18, a Southern
woman who called herself Beatrice Booth, and
who had b?en living i:i rooms at 107 First
avenue, disappeared. She was the oniv one of
her class here who had a maid and the maid
went with her. It was reported t len that the
woman, who a. ways nnd plenty of money, was
oi; her way to either China or Japan. The
woman was tail, dark and very beautiful. If
the woman's name is Taylor It is thought she
may be a Miss Mamie Taylor, daughter of a
prominent Pittsburg lamily, who is supposed
to be on a visit to friends, and with whom Mr.
Oakley is allowed to have been on good terms

AMONG THE
WORKINGMEN
Policemen Are Actively
Engaged in Carpen
tering.
The Injustice Will Be Presented
to the Board of Super
visors.
Journeymen Barbers Will Open an
Employment Bureau for Their
Idle Members.
Matters in labor union circles show a
prospect of brightening up a little of late.
While it is yet too early in the spring to
determine to what extent the wave of
prosperity goes, there are many indica
tions that go to show that better times
are coming. During the winter months
business in all lines is dull, and particu
larly during an election year, but the
opening of summer starts up industries of
all kinds.
The prospect of early work on the new
Postoffice building has led many to pre
dict a great relief to a sadly overcrowded
labor market. News from the builders
shows that quite a number of new struc
tures are contemplated, and as the
building trade is a good criterion to go by
it is expected that the other crafts will
not be far behind when better times come.
At a meeting of the District Council of
Carpenters and Joiners at 102 O'Farrell
street last evening, reports were made
that members of the local police force are
ongaged in carpentering work on new
municipal buildings. One in particular is
the new police station at O'Farrell and
Devisadero streets.
Tnree police officers whose services are
required for the purpose of keeping the
peace are at work there, doing work that
is keeping that number of regular carpen
ters out of employment. Several of the
Supervisors have been seen relative to
t hi- matter, and they assert that there is
no money for the payment of carpenters
lor such work. Chief Crowley, too, was
seen by a committee from the council, and
he made the same statement.
The Chief told the Committee that this
work must be done, and he is only using
the police officers because be cannot
secure money for the payment of regular
carpenters. It was decided 10 petition
the Board of Supervisors in its next ap
propriation to allow sufficient money for
such work. Not only is the carpentering
business affected, but tinners, plumbers,
painters and other mechanics are affected,
as policemen are called upon to do all of
these kinds of work.
International Journeymen Barbers'
Union No. 27 has decided to open a free
employment bureau, where its members
may secure positions without being
obliged to pay out of their small earnings
fees that they can ill afford.
It is to be kept open at all times and the
proprietors of barbershops may upon ap
plication secure the services of first-class
men. Every barber out of work will be
registered. All jobs, regular or extra, will
be kept on record for the inspection of all.
Tlii* will be a sort of barbers' directory
which will often prove of use.
The Machinists' Union held its regular
meeting lnsi night at 32 O'Farrell street.
The membership of thin union is very
iarge and the hall was crowded.
It was noted with satisfaction on hearing
the report that all present were employed,
and that there are lew idle members not
withstanding the hard times. Many non
union men, however, wera reported to be
knocking round the town doing nothing-
It has been found necessary, in conse
quence of the increase in the membership
of the union, to move to nvore comm odious
quarters, and on the first Wednesday in
April the first meeting will be held in the
new quarters, Seven Fines Hall of the Al
cazar building.
The Plumbers' Union held its regular
quarterly meeting last night on the first
floor of the Alcazar building. The event
wns one at which a great deal of business
is usually transacted, and the number of
chairs vacant was zero.
Times in the plumbing line were re
ported in general to be good. Several
speeches of encouragement were delivered
on the changes for the better hoped for
during the coming administration.
It was nnallydecided that the grand an
nual picnic of the plumbers will be held
at Sunset Park, in the Santa Cruz Moun
tains, on June 20. Tiiis will be a big
affair and tbe intent is to make it eclipse
anything of the kind held heretofore.
.Preparations Â«re even now in progress.
The Pressmen's Union met as usual last
evening in Myrtle Hall of the Alcazar
building. There was a full attendance.
Although business was not as good as
hoped for, the general opinion was ex
pressed that it is now only a question of
a short time till the turn in National af
fairs will bring better times.
One of the members of the union ap-
Deared to have met with some misfortune
and the members devoted a good deal of
the time of the meeting to giving him tbe
helping hand. A handsome gold watch
was raffled off, the proceeds fnlly justify
ing the interest taken in the matter by
the union.
The largest heathen temple in the world
is in Seringapatam, and it comprises a
square, each side being one mile in length,
inside of which are six other squares. The
walls are 25 feet high and 5 feet thick, and
the hall where pilgrims congregate is sup
ported by 1000 pillars, each cut from a sin
gle block of stone.
