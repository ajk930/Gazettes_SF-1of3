CUBANS DOWNHEARTED OVEE
: THE DISASTER;
This Increases lhe Soff?riqg and
Dangers of the Expedition on
Vy .. â¢' No Name Key. . ..;
JACKSONVILLE, Fi,a., Jan. 2.â The
: feteatner Commodore sank in twenty
fathoms of water twenty miles northeast
of.Moscfuito Inlet at 3 o'clock this morn
ing. All of.-: the men on board were res
cued and - twelve of them reached Jackson
ville to-night.
The s-tury of the accident, as told by one
of. tUe men, is as follows:
The steamer crossed the St. Johns bar
at 2 o'clock Friday afternoon and at mid
night was 100 miles down the coast. One
of the men went into the hold for some
thing and found it half full of water.
Great excitement prevailed, but the
..pumps were started and every one on
board put to work bailing. The water
gained steadily, and at 3 o'clock the
steamer was deserted, R. A. Deigado tak
ing command of one boat with eleven
oilier men in, it and Captain Murphy
com manding the other.
Ttre Deigado party landed on the beach
near New Smyrna, at 10:30 a. m., but Cap
tain Murphy's boatload did not land until
9 o'clock to-night. The boat is said to
have been overloaded with coal when it
left here and it is thought tnat she sprung
her seams when she grounded on Commo
dore Point in going down the St. Johns.
Stephen Crane, ttie ijovoJist, was on
board and was in Captain Murphy's boat.
'i'he Cubans here are downhearted over
the accident, and especially as the Com
modore was expected to carry the men
ieft by the Three Friends on No Name
Key.
W. A. Bisbee, owner of the Dauntless,
recived the following from the commander
tv-day: "The Dauntless rescued a laree
ho iy of men ami a cargo from No Name
Key. Many of the men were in a helpless
condition. The Dauntless will wait and
meet the Commodore and deliver the men
aÂ«d cargo to her. Will report as per sig
nals seen at Miami, and will return as
soon as we meet the Commodore â prob
abiy Friday."
This confirms the reports received from
Key West Friday night, stating that the
Dauntless was anchored off No Name Key
Friday afternoon, taking on men aud
careo.
The Cnbajis here are very much con
cerned over the report that many of the
men are in a helpless condition. It is not
beiieved tl,at any of them were wound d
when fired upon by the Spanish, patrol
boat off the Cuban coast, but that their
condition is the result of exposure on No
Name Key. lie key is a desert and the
men have had no protection from the
weather for the past ten daya.
MACEO IS YET ALIVE.
Said to Be ftecovorlner From t^
Wounds Inflicted through the
Treachery of Zertucha,
HAVANA, Cuba. Jan. 2 (via Key West,
Jan. 2).â Reports that Maceo ia alivfrare
coming constantly from the field and all
tend .!a-' Â»hoJ* that he is recuperating
rapidly. Letters received In Havana from
his medical attendants exphun the nature
of his wounds and confirm previous re
ports and repeat the story of Zertucha's
treachery. They cay . that Maceo, with
his staff, came to meet Ahuniada under a
flag of truce and that . Cirujeda and his
forces were ambushed.
As soon as Maceo appeared the
Spaniards opened fire. Maceo being in"
front, fell from his horse, Gomez also fell
at his side. The rest of {he staff, some of
whom were wounded, managed to escape
and reached Baldomero. Acosta'* camp
instantly gathered all its small forces and
rushed to their assistance. They made a
dpsperate tight and drove Cirujeda into
Punta Brava, recovered tne bodies and
carried the apparently dead Maceo with
them.
He remained unconscious for fonr days
and five nights and when prepared for
burial it was found that he was still alive.
As soon as he was able to be transported
he was carried with the greatest care and
under a strong esÂ«ort to the Ci?nega hosr
pitais, though others say to Siguana. ." "
It appears tbat the object of the Cubans
as soon as,Maceo is abje to move is to send

The butcheries continue, although it is
said that orders have been sent to Fon

are unable to move into Havana mently

speak. It is only known thai the victims
are taken from therr homes at night and

EDICTS BY WEYLER.
Trying: to Starve Sympathizers
With Insurgents by Closing:
Stores In Small Towns.
HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. 2. â General
Weyler has issued from his camp at Baye
fe two edicts bearing date of yesterday.
One of them prohibits the storage, or sale
of horses, saddlery, clothing, provisions
or medicines in unfortified towns. It also
absolutely prohibits the removal of such
goods from the towns in the provinces of
Pinar del Rio, Havana and Matanzas,
without a military permit.
It is ordered that eight days after the
date of the edict all stores in unprotected
villages and ham lets must be closed and
their goods removed to stronger places.
This applies also to stores on the un
fortined estates in the provinces of Santa
Clara, Puerto Principe and Santiago de
Cuba. Those persons who violate the
edict will be considered rebel sympathizers
and wi.ll be tried and condemned as such.
The other edict orders tne formation of
zones of cultivation around the towns, and
allots for the cultivation of vegetables,
etc., a piece of ground free of charge to
each family concentrated in the towns
under previous edicts.
These persons will be allowed to hold
the land free of all charges for six months
after the insurrection shall have been
suppressed. An exception is made, how
ever, in the case of those families which
have a brother or husband in the rebel
ranks. To these nodand will be allotted.
It.is rumored that the rebel Jose Maria
Aguirre has died from pneumonia.
An engagement has taken place at Blan
quizal, province of Pinar del Rio, between
a rebel party and a detachment of Span
ish troops. The rebels were defeated after
losing twenty of their number killed. The
Spanish loss was a major, a lieutenant and
two privates seriously wounded.
SHOULD STOP THT WAR.
! Senator Cullom Say. it 16 ct.s Duty
of the United Status to
Protect the Cubans.
CHICAGO. 111., Jan. 2. â Senator
Shelby M, Cullom arrived in Chicago to
day. The Senator refused to discuss the
present Senatorial contest in Illinois. He
bel.eves the Cameron bill will be pressed
for passage and no through, if not in its
present shape, then slightly modified, but
deprived of none of its force. Senator
Cullpm expressed views on other matters
of general interest and forgot conservat
ism when he spoke of Cuba.
"It is the duty of some strong nation to
put a stop to the warfare in Cuba," he de
clared. "It is brutal. It not only out
rages humanity, but violates the spirit of
the Monroe lioctrine. The United States
ought not to allow the Spaniards, a com
paratively strong nation, to oppress a de
fen-selebs community almost within its
borders. Effort has been made to take
advantage of the vacation to change the
opinion of some members of the Senate,
but it will not avail. I do not know
whether the present administration will
do anything or not, but it should. If
humane interests are not to be considered,
the damage done among American com
merce ought to prove a factor in influencing
the proper authorities to use the best
means in their power to stop the war.
The Cameron resolution will be pressed
for passage. Unless it develops a more
violent opposition than already shown, I
thick it will be passed."
TO CHECK FILIBUSTERS.
Increased Vigilance In the Florida
Coast Patrol Ordered by the
Government.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 2.âln
creased vigilance in the filibuster patrol
along the Florida coast is to be exhibited
by the Government and no effort is to be
spared to prevent the violation of neu
trality. Not only have tho orders for the
return north- of the cruiser Newark at
Key West been countermanded, but others
have been issued for the dispatch-boat
Dolphin, heretofore utilized wholly as an
executive yacht, to proced to the Florida
coast at once, and she is expected to leave
the Washington navy-yard to-night for
her new duties. As soon as she can be
made ready the dynamite gunboat Ye-
SQvius will be sent to supplement , the
naval and revenue cutter force, and if
necessary, the torpedo-boats Cushing and
Ericsson will speedily follow them. All
these vessels are admiraDly adapted for
the work, particularly the torpedo vessels,
which can enter all the lagoons and cruise

CAPITAL OF THE CUBANS.
Pen Picture of the Mountain
Stronghold Where Insurgents
Maintain a Government.
That the Cuban patriots have an active
and fully established Government, with a
fixed place of abode, can no longer be gain
said. From the heights of the Sierra Cu
bitas their standard waves, and from the
Matanzas line on tho west to Cape Maisi
at the eastern extremity, throughout the
whole breadth of the island, with the ex
ception of the]larger towns.it is recognized
as the emblem of authority â the flSg of
the people of Cuba;
Sierra Cuoitas is within less than twen
ty-five miles of the city of Puerto Principe
and less than that distance from the
strongly fortified port of Nuevitas, within
sight of the great caraino, or highway,
from Havana to Santiago de Cuba. Yet
here within a day's march of the Spani h
garrisons the Cubans have established and
have maintained for fifteen months their
seat of Government.
To the east lies the town of Zanjou,
whore the Cubans were duped into sign
ing a treaty of peace, the conditions of
which the Spaniards never meant to ob
serve, and thus lost all the fruit? of the
ten years' struggle from 1838 to 1878.
Southeast, near the boundary between
Puerto Principe and Santiago de Cuba, is
Guaimaro, where the first constitution
was promulgated. Southeast of Manza
nillo lies the town of I'ara, where the first
republic was proclaimed.
The present move ment for independence
was first declared on February 24, 1895, at
Ybarra, in Matanzas, by about two dozen
men, but the first real organization was
made farther east in the province of San
tiago de Cuba. Marti, the organizer of the
revolutionary movement, issued a call
during the summer for a constitutional
convention to meet on September 13.
Delegates from all the provinces, except
Pinar del Rio, were present. Three days
later a constitution was adopted, and on
Sentembcr 18 the convention elected Slate
officers and the government of the repub
lic of Cuba was inaugurated.
Salvador Cisneros, who had been Presi
dent of the former republic from 1873 till
the peaces of El Zanjou in 1878, was
chosen as President, and with him Bar
tolome Mazo of Manzanilla, Vice-Presi
dent; Raphael Portuondo of Santiago de
Cuba, Secretary of State for Foreign AfÂ«
fairs; Carlos Roloff of Santa Clara, Secre
tary of War, and Sivero Pina of Espiritu
Santo, Secretary of the Treasury.
Maximo Gomez was at the same time
chosen as commander-in-chief, Alorti
having been kiiled shortly before, and
Antonio Maceo as his lieutenant-general.
Laws were also passed dividing the i.-land
into States, districts and prefectures, es
tablisuing rostofhees, regulating mar
riages and providing for the imposition
and collection of taxes. Local officers
under the new Government were soon
after installed in many places in the three
eastern provinces.
The seat of the Government was soon
after established on the top of the Sierra
Cubitas ju3t north of Puerto Principe,
where it has since been kept and practi
cally unmolested by the Spanish army.
This place is naturally most difficult of
access, and with but a handful of men can
be held against any sized force. In places
the only pathway winds round the side of
a precipitous .mountain and is so narrow
that two men cannot ride abreast. A body

HAMMOND DRIVEN .
TO HIS DEATH
Suicide of the Second Vice-
President of a Defunct
Bank.
Worried to Desperation by the
U: just Stories Concerning
Ead Management.
Stealing Away From Wife and Chil
dren H? Finds Rest in the Waters
of Lake Michigan.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 2.â William A.
Hammond, who was second vice-president
of the failed National Bank of Illinois,
went from his Evanston homo partly
dressed and apparently demented about 2
o'clock this morning, and leaving a trail
of torn and twisted private papers in his
path, sought tiie Dempster-street pier, from
wnich he threw himself inte the icy waters
of Lake Michigan to obtain relief from the
troubles which have i ilecl upon him in the
last two weeks.
The body was found shortly after noon
at the foot of Church street, whither it had
been carried by the undertow. It was
taken to the Morgue, where an inquest
was held.
The intelligence of the banker's self
destruction, so closely following that of
Banker Otto Wasmansdorff, was a dis
tressing shock to Chicago bankers and the
friends of the dead man, although not al
together a surprise to those who knew
under what, a terrible mental strain Mr.
Hammond had been living since he had
been held up to public scorn by a Chicago
newspaper as the wrecker of the National
Bank or Illinoisâ a charge which is indig
nantly characterized as a malicious lie by
the suicide's intimate friends and lawyer.
Although despondent to an unusual
degree last night Mr. Hammond gnve no
warning to friend or iamily, and there is
nothing in the circumstances surrounding
hid tragic end which would warrant the
assumption thathe had contemplated kill
ing himself. Shortly before 11 o'clock last
night he telephoned from bis home to
that of his closest friend in the suburban
town, Peroy Palmer, to learn if he was at
home, as he wished to pay him a visit.
Rain was falling heavily, but Mr. Ham
mond insisted on making the call. Mr.
Palmer saw that his friend was in bad
shape physically and mentally. He ap
peared to be a broken man in every way.
In conversation with Mr. Palmer his mind
wandered. He said he mast realize by
selling his homestead, which ia in his
wife's name. He refused to be encouraged
by prospects held out for future useful
ness. His visit was brief, and declining
the offer of Mr. Palmer to accompany him
home or take a waterproof coat or um
brella to protect him from the heavy rain
fall Mr. Hammond returned to his home
on foot. He must have walked unneces
sarily in the rain because it was after ]
o'clock when Mrs. Hammond saw him
enter the bouse. He talked a little with
her and seemed to be more cheerful.
Their 2-year-o'd child had been restless
for several nights and Mrs. Hammond
was so fatigued that she slept soundly in
a room adjoining that in which Mr. Ham
mond went to retire, apparently. The
baby was sleeping with its mother. About
2 o'clock Mrs. Hammond was conscious of
some one entering her room, and she sup
posed Mr. Hammond had come in, their
room being separated by an unlocked
door. It is believed the trouble-rac&ed
father entered to imprint a good-by kiss
on the face of his little child.
It was nearly 6 o'clock when Mrsu Ham
mond woke and at onco noticed that the
door leading to her husband's room was
ajar farther than was customary, and his
absence aroused all her latent fears for his
fate. Family friends near by were hur
riedly summoned to search for the miss
ing man and notify the police. Byrney J.
Moore and George 8. Lord, old friends,
walked to an old pier at the front of
Dempster street, not far from tho Ham
mond homestead, and their suspicions
and fears were verified by finding a trail
of torn paper with Mr. Hammond's sig
nature on some. The banker's crazed
condition was indicated by tiie manner in
which he had scattered and torn and
twisted his private papers during his
melancholy journey to his death.
Standing on the pier he dropped more
of his papers, which quickly clung to the
wood because of the beating rain. The
discovery of this clew confirmed all fears
that Mr. Hammond was no longer-alive,
and airaneements were made to drag the
lake. The sad news was borne to Chicago
ana to the iamily, but was received with
much incredulity at first.
When the body was removed from th?
shallow water it was found to be dressed
in underclothes, trousers, coat and felt
shoes, showing that the dead man had
dressed in haste. In a pocket was found
a memorandum written by Mr. Haru-
mond on a letter-head of Farson, Leach &
Co., the promoters and chief owners of the
Calumet "Electric Street Railway Com
pany. It contained the following items:
December 16, 1896â National Bank of Illi
nois. $1,497,000; foreign exchange, $522,
--000; Banu of Illinois, $97500. Outside
loans â Joliet National, $20,000; E. G.
Orawiord, $5000; Sliawmut, $10Q,00U; In
dependence National, $50,000; Mercantile
National, $100,000; Woif. $17,000. Total
$2,475,500. Interest $67,000. Note-Na
tional Bank of Illinois note on Calumet
$90,000.
These figures are significant on the
foreign exchange item corresponding to
the amount which Mr. Hammond is ac
cused of carrying on the bank books to
that account, when the money really
represented an extra loan on Calumet
Electric bonds, and in the total corre
sponding to the total loaned on Calumet
Electric security by the bank.
Ten days ago a local morning paper
published a sensational and lengthy at
tack upon the dead man's honesty as an
officer of Bank of Illinois. It directly
accused him of wrecking the institution,
of playing the role of "kiter," of specula
ting with other people's money, of prac
ticing care.ully planned deception on his
fellow directors and the depositors for
years and sealing the lips of President
Schneider by allowing the accounts of
Weiss and Berger, sons-in-law of the pres
dent, to pass safe bounds. This paper al
leged, "He has violated, willfully and de
liberately, the law which is supposed to
protect the people from the operations of
such as he."
Referring to these charges friends of
Mr. Hammond united in declaring that
they had driven him to his death.
Receiver McKeon of the Bank of Illi
nois said that Mr. Hammond had been
daily at the ba.ik to assist him and noth
ing had been said by him which would
have led the suicide to suspect criminal
prosecution.
Mr. Hammond had been employed in
Chicago banks for twenty-five years, be
ginning as messanger and being steadily
promoted from the beginning of his em
ployment in the failed bank. Most of his
fortune was invested in the bank's stocks,
although he was prominently interested
in other banks, insurance and other com
panies. He leaves fcur young children.
He carried $60,000 life insurance. Mrs.
Hammond is in a serious condition to

Could Ifct Appear in Court to Answer
(hnrgea '.gninÂ»t Him.
CHICAGO, 111.. Jan. 2.â The case of the
alleged taking of a deposit of $154 from
Frank Kennedy, a saloon-keeper, by the
banking fi.m of E. S. Dreyer & po., when
the owners of the bank knew they were
insolvent, was called before Justice of the
Peace Hall this atternoon. Robert Ber
ger, one of the defendants, was in court
with Charles Wacker, the bondsman, and
Mr. Dreyer was represented by his attor
ney. The senior partner is lying at his
Cleveland-avenue home in a serious phy
sical and mental condition, and the de
fense asked for a continuance of ten days,
which was readily agreed to by the prose
cution. The bonds were accordingly re
newed for a hearing January 12.
The fact that V ice-President Hammond
of the National Bank of Illinois had com
mitted suicide was known at the time,
and Bandsman Wacker voiced his fears by
asking Justice Hall, "If Mr. Dreyer killed
himself, what effect would it have on my
bond?"
It was reported that Mr. Dreyer's men
tal condition was the cause of much ap
prehension among the banker's relatives
and friends, and his phys:cian had or
dered a strict watch to be kept on his
movements at home. Mr. Dreyer is suf
feriug from an old kidney trouble.
TWO FRESH FAILURES.
The Omaha Savings lUiuli Forced to Closn
It*- Door*.
OMAHA, Nebr., Jan. 2.â The Omaha
Savings Bank, the oldest savings bank
in the city and the principal of the two
savings banks left in Omaha, closed this
morning.
Ex-Senator Manderson, president of the
bank, has made the following statement
concerning the affairs of the institution:
"In the fall of 1893 we had about $1,000,000
in deposits, which crew until January,
1896, when there were $1,360,000 in de
posits.
"On July 9 the German Savings Bank
closed its doors and a steady and constant
drain was made upon our bank, so onr de
posits have shrunk to $750,600, showing
that we have paid out about $610,000 in a
little over five months. The bank owes to
depositors $750,000 and to hanks $140,000,
making the total liabilities $890,000. Taking
the real estate at cost and our real estate
and other securities at face value, we have
nearly $200,000 of assets beyond our liabili
ties. While the bank is unable at this
time to pay its depositors on demand it is
amply solvent, and while it will take
some time to realize on the assets not a
dollar will be lost to any creditor or de
positor in the bank. In addition to the
$1,100,000 of assets with which to pay de
positors there is also tho double liability
on the stockholders, which will swell the
amount to at least $1,200.000. "
General Anderson also said that an
effort would be made by the directors to
give a suitable bond to the State Banking
Board for the protection of depositors
which would enable them to put in their
own receiver. This could be done more
economically than by an outsider ap
pointed by the board.
WHITEHALL, Mich., Jan. 2.â Bank
Examiner Angell this mornine closed the
\yhiiehall Savings Bank. Much excite
ment prevails. The las: report shows
$80,000 in deposits, $2000 on hand and
loans and discounts $92,000. The officials
have made no statement.
JfJAr SEM>AIIO.\AL SUITS.
Complication* to Follow the Failure of a
Hanking Howie.
HOLLIDAYSBURG, Pa., Jan. 2.â The
recent failure of the banking-house of
Gardner, Morrow & Co. of Hollidaysbnrg
will result in many sensational suits in
court. To-day it was made public that
the strongbox or casket, containing the
securities and title papers of the estate. of
the late Judge James Gardner, the senior
partner In the bank, had been impounded
in the Blair County Court to help pay the
claims of the depositors. This box is said
to hold $100,000 worth of United States
bonds, a sum sufficient to pay one-third of
the bank's indebtedness. It will be opened
in court on Monday by Judee John M.
Baylev, in the presence of District Attor
ney Hammond and the many depositors.
.Ve.Kinleij at Cleveland.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Jan. 2.â Major
McKinley's first day in Chicago was an
enjoyable one. He found General Wil
liam M. Osborue and other friends at Mr.
Hanna's home, who yave him cordial
greeting. Later the major and Mrs. Mc-
Kinley took a long drive. It is Major
McKinley's intention to receive as few
visitors as possible and devote all his time
to work on his inaugural audres?, which
he hopas to finish before he returns to
Canton. K. W. Patterson of Chicago
called on Major McKinley this afternoon
to discuss Illinois affairs and appoint
ments. No promises regarding Illinois
patronage have been made by the Presi
dent-elect. Senator Cullom will be here
Monday to confer wi'h Major McKinley.
Thn monetary Convention.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Jan. 2.â The
executive committee of the Monetary
Commission held a meeting to-day and
settled a number of minor details. The
first point that developed was trie receipt
of a telegram from William E. Dodge of
New York, stating that his name could
not be considered in connection with the
duties of presiding < th'cer, his health
being so that be could not possibly pre
side. There is talk of making ex-Gov
ernor E. 0. Stanard of St. Louis temporary
chairman of the convention, and it is
probable the sub-committee will suggest
him for this office to the full executive
committee when it meets here the day
before the convention meets.

stable in the rear of his residence to-day.
His financial affairs are in good condi

Continued from First Page.
Frank L. Coombs of Napa. Mr. Coombsin
iormed him that be desired the speaker
snip for the purpose of helping him along
in his laudable ambition to be appointed
United States Minister to Japan. Mr.
Kenyon thereupon graciously agreed to
withdraw, and in return for this favor Mr.
Coombs and his friends will advocate Mr.
Kenyon for the temporary speak ership.
There does not appear to be any danger
ous opposition to either of them.
County Clerk Curry, Colonel Eddy and
Mike Smith of San Francisco were among
tho early arrivals to-day, and they lost no
time in getting into the thick of the con
flict, for Mr. Smith has many friends who
are saying good words for him in his
aspirations for the appointment as ser
geant-at-arms of the Senate. He and his
friends are very confident of winnine,
while on the other hand the friends of
Leslie Blackburn are claiming that they
have the battle won already. Thomas
Martin, the remaining candidate, is equally
confident that be will be the winner.
Thirty-nine Republican members of the
Assembly went into caucus in the Golden
Eagle Hotel to-night and considered tne
question of patronage. A harmonious
understanding was had, to the effect that
there should be an equal division of the
patronage among the Republican Assem
blymen. In order to bring this about a
committee of seven was appointed to in
vestigate and report upon the number of
attaches and their salaries, with a view of
recommending an^equitabJe division.
The matter of the employment of women
as clerks of committees came up in the
shape of a protest from several members,
who thought that the women, who had r.o
votes, were crowding to the wall the men,
who bad votes; but the protest was laid
on the table and the fairer sex will be rep
resented as usual in the halls of legisla
tion.
The Senators will caucus to-morrow
afternoon on the subject of organization,
and there will undoubtedly be a good
attendance.
Senator Perkins' friends are very much
surprised to find so determined an opposi
tion to his re-election. It is now stated
that more than twenty Republican mem
bers will decline to go intocauc.is, and
that the reason for their declination is
their unwillingness to vote for him. It is
being developed, also, that the number of
legislators actually pledged to support the
Senator is much smaller than was gen
erally believed. Many of tho c believed
to have been pledged were not pledged by
the Assembly districts by which they were
placed in nomination, and they consider
themselves as free'as air with reference to
tiieir action on the Senatorship.
In some mysterious manner Perkins'
strength appears to be oozing away every
hour. Every train tbat arrives to-nigat
brines legislators and workers who will
not be for him. They say that they will
make an effort to postpone organization
until after Monday, which will retard the
election of a United States Senator for
another week. This is the first step of the
opposition. It will har.ily be a difficult
task, because the contest for >ergeant-at
armÂ« in both houses will he very spirited.
Charles M. Shortridge, Colonel Isaac
Trumbo and a large delegation arrived
from San Francisco by the Jast train this
evening. They are renewing old ac
quaintances in the lobby and talking
everything but politics.

Pickett of the Laguna de Tache grant, in
the southwestern portion of the county,
is having an interesting' time with
hunters in his efforts to keep them off
the extensive domain in his charge.' He
bad fourteen of them arrested recently.
They hailed from Leetnore, Hanford and
the surrounding country. The trials of
three have already been held, but in each
case the defendant was acquitted by a
jury. The trials of- the others have not
yet taken place.
â  The course of the manager was prompted
by necessity, for the hunters' trespassing
was becoming serious. â ' - Some of â¢ them
have been very careless, and many cattle
have had their : hides filled with shot.
Some were seriously wounde-l. The
arrested hunters have employed Judge
Irwin of Hanford to defend them.

... adtopted'by the Government of India to
check t{ie famine in that country were

*. thousands of persons are dying from
starvation,' calls attention to the general
. apathy on the subject thus far displayed
â¢in England. ' â¢ â  â  â¢
â, The Queen some time ago sent a tele
ram" to the Viceroy of India expressing
sympathy for the sufferers and promising
that they would be assisted, but thus far
*â â â¢ nothing of cdnsequence has been done by
tlie*tl.ovÂ«rnnient to avert the effects of one
. of the neatest calamities thai have ever
threatened Lndia.
â¢ Comparisons are made in the matter be
tween the attitude of Great Britain and
â¢ _ Russia, which "do hot redound greatly to
the" credit of th*!} country. It is known
â¢ that the Czar has several times expressed
himself-as being deeply concerned in the
outcome of -the famine and his interest
â¢ has iak'en a pratical tnrn which will un
â¢ do*ubte.<lly result in some alleviation of
â¢ the widespread distress in the Indian em-
PJre'oT Great Britain.
The newspapers of Moscow and St. Pe
tersburg continue their appeals for help
for the famine sufferers, and in other di
rections steps are beins: taken to aid the
victims. In some English quarters the
opinion obtains that this generous
action of the Russians is only a
mask hiding some deep-laid political
scheme; having for Its object the raising
of disaffection in India against British
rule. Some of the Tory papers express
their approval of declarations that have
appeared in certain Indian papers to the
effect that aid Irom such a source should
not be accepted. But they do not urge
the Government to extend aid to the suf
ferers, and in the meantime thousands of
the natives are dying.
There is no question in the minds of
those who are not blinded by hatred of
Russia that the Russian movement had
its origin entirely la charitable motives
and. that it was intended as a response to
the foreign aid given at the 'time of the
great Russian famine some live years ago.
The opinion is gaining ground that the
Indian Government is not able to cope
with the situation, and that unless im
perial aid is extended the famine will
prove one of the most calamitous visita
tions of the kind that bave ever affected
India.
GENERAL StCKLES VERY ILL.
Suffering Nervous Prostration From Over-
work During the Last Cam
paign.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 2.â General
Daniel E. Sickles is now very ill from the
effects of overwork, which has produced
an attack of nervous prostration entailing
extreme insomnia. "I fear lam an ill
man," said General Sickles when seen at
his residency last night, "My physicians
.tell me very frankly that my affliction is
quite serious. But then, it must be re
membered that -I am an old man now, as
I have passed' my seventieth year and I
"have experienced 'many exposures and
have done pienty of bard work.
"So it is not strange that I should begin
to seriously feel tue effect of it. No doubt
the work I did during ihe last campaign
is responsible for my present condition.
I overworked. 'I was sustained through it
by patriotic -motives. Now the reaction
has set in and I must expect and accept
â¢the results to be looked for at my time of
life; .But lam content. I would as lief
lose' my life in such a battle as in veritable
warfare. It was a great. victory and if one
of the costs is my life lam satisfied. The
work of those.eight weeks during the very
heat of the campaign was continuous and
frightfully wearing. ' .
. r 'ln one case I rode 1600 miles, passing
â through "thfrteen . States an-d making 250
.speeches.- '-Besides tire campaign work, I
have organized a thousand branches of
the Union Veterans' Patriotic League and
done.other work incidental to the labor of
organizing. Now, the disease which
naturally follows the exhaustion which I
endured is racking -me, for Lam suffering
from ah acute attack of nervous prcstra
iion and an apparently unconquerable in
somnia is doing its work in shattering my
.overstrained' â ' nerves. I -am fighting
against it, but .with little hope. I am
very restless and cannot keep my mind,
even for a brief- time, on any oue thing.
Much work that I hoped to accomplish 1
have had to turn over to others. I took
deep interest in the organization of 10,000
soldiers to take part in the inauguration
of Mr. McKuiley, and have been prom
ised 2000 Confederate veterans in the
number.
"They are men now deeply end ear
nestly patriotic, who voted for McKinl?y.
More than likeiy 1 will not even De able
to attenil the inauguration, but the 10,000
soldiers will be in line, for 1 have turned
the matter over to General Porter."
MATE BRAM /S CONVICTED.
Found Guilty by a Jury of Having Mur
dered Thrse Persons op the
High Seas.
BOSTON, Mass., Jan. 2.â Thomas Brara,
mate of the barkentine Herbert Fuller,
was found guilty toÂ«day ot the murders
committed on that vessel last July. The
jury went out at 1:30 p. m. yesterday. At
10 o'clock this morning they reported
that they could not agree. Judge Colt
directed them to retire for further consid
eration. They were again locked up,
with the result that at 3:40 p. M. they an
nounced a verdict of guilty.
The murder was one of the strangest
of sea tragedies. On July 21 last the
marine observer at Halifax, N. S., made
out a vessel coming slowly into the harbor
flying the stars and stripes at half mast,
indicating death, and a black fiag be
neath it. This meant mutiny. Tue po
lice were turned out in a hurry and sent
to meet the vessel. She was the Ameri
can barkentine Herbert Fuller, 670 tons,
oi Harrington, Maine. In her caoin lay
the bodies of Captain Nash, the captain's
wife and the second mate, Bftmberg. The
cook and a young Harvard student
named Lester H. Monks were in chare of
the ship, while Seaman Charies Brown
and Mate Thomas Bram were in irons on
deck.
The story was a horrible one. On Mon
day night, July 13, Monks, who was a
passenger on the vessel, which had sailed
for Rosario, Argentine, was awakened by
a woman's screams. He jumped up,
groped his way to the chartroom, where
the captain blept. He put his hand into
the berth and drew it away smeared wiih
blood. He at once made for the deck and
met Mate Bram, who made a lunge at
him with a piece of lumber. Monks drew
a revolver and covered Bram. Monks
and the cook took charge of the vessel,
put the first mate, Bram, in irons, and
navigated to Halifax. Bram was con
victed on the evidence of Seaman Brown,
who testified that he saw the murders.
Brown was at the wheel that night, and
he said he saw Bram strike Captain Nash
wiih an ax. No motive for tue murders
wa3 brought out at the trial, and there
was a strong feeling in some quarters that
Bram was not the guilty nerson.

NEW YORK, N. V.. Jan. 2.â The At
lantic Garden, which is one of the. oldest
landmarks on the Bowery, changed hands
yesterday, when William Kramer Sr.,
founder of the place, presented it as a gift

The place had at one time been one of
the numerous headquarters of Genera!
Washington. It was maintained for years
afterward as a genuine German place of
amusement, ana as such gained a world
wide reputasion. Mr. Kramer is said to
now own property in this city valued at
17.000,000. The founder of the garden re
tired from business many years ago.

BRILLIANT EVENTS
IN THE FATHERLAND
Diplomats Hold a Grand
Reception on New
Year's Day.
Emperor William Delivers a
Characteristic Address to
the Generals.
Says the Armaments of Germany
Mast Be Kept In Pace With
Other Nations.
BERLIN, Germany, Jan. 2.â The New
Year's reception given by the diplomatic
corps yesterday was a brilliant event.
The reception was held in Marble Hall o!
the Schloss and was very largely attended,
nearly all of the Emfcassadors and Min
isters accredited to 'he German court be
ing present. The i^mperor was in ex
cellent spirits and immediately after he
entered the hall mingled v\i h the guests,
greeting them with cordial hand-shakings
and cheerful smiles. His Majesty was
especially a<>reenb!e to United States Em
bassador Uhl, witn whom he conversed
for some time, inquiring as to President
Cleveland's health, asking how Mr. Uhl
liked Berlin, etc. The Kaiser also spoke
admiringly of the growth and prosperity
of the United States and showed himself
to be well informed upon the political
affairs and economic .conditions of the
American republic. Despite the depress
ing weather which prevailed on Friday
the other court festivities proceeded with
the usual gayety.
Unter den Linden and adjacent streets
were thronged with people at daybreak,
many of those in the crowds having re
mained in their places throughout the
night in oraer to be in position to see the
official ' celebration of the day. At 8
o'clock in the morning all infantry of the
garrison marched from the Schloas to the
Brandenburg gate and back, each regiment
with its band playing popular airs.
At 10 o'clock religious services were held
in the chapel of the Schloss, lasting forty
minutes. The entire imperial family was
present. The Emperor entered the chapel
giving his arm to his mother, and the Em
press was escorted by Prince Arnolph of
Bavaria. After the services in the chapel
the Empe:or and Empress held a recep
tion in the White Hall of the Schloss,
where their majesties received the con
gratulations of the court. The military
officers wore parade uniforms. The Em
peror next went to the Rittersaal (the
Hall of the Knights), where he delivered
a brief address to the generals who had as
sembled to receive him.
Accounts vary as to the nature of his
Majesty's speech, but it is asserted upon
good authority that he referred to the bill
before the Reichstag providing for the
aupmentation of the artillery arm of the
military service, declaring that the arma
ments of Germany must keep pace with
those of other nations. The Emperor is
also quoted as saying that the year 1897
must see the task of increasing the
strength of the artillery service achieved.
L?aving the Rittersaal the Kaiser went
to the arsenal, where the officers of the
entire garrison of Berlin were assembled.
To these he gave the watchword of the
day, and in the afternoon he made several
private visits. At 6 o'clock the Emperor
dined with his family. The approaches
to the Schloss were crowded with sight
seers until long after dark.
The opposition of the German stock and
produce exchanges to the new Bourse law
prohibiting future transactions and im
posing other restrictions upon Bourse
trading was the subject of discussion at
the special Ministerial council which was
held on Wednesday. The meeting was
called to order by Dr. yon Boetticher,
vice-prnsident of the Council of Ministers,
who presided, when the Emperor sud
denly made his appearance and took the
chair," which he occupied for two hours.
On Tuesday another meeting was held,
with the Imperial Chancellor, Prince
Hohenlohe, in the chair. The calling of
these two meetings, which occurred only
twenty-four hours apart, is clearly indica
tive of the gravity of this trouble, as it is
regarded by the Ministry, and the discus
sion of the subject by the Ministers was
in the direction of devising means to over
come it.
Nothing is known of tha proceedings of
the council at which the Emperor pre
sided, but it is known that tha meeting
presided over by Prince Hohenlohe took
into consideration the effects of the resolu
tion passed by the .Berlin Produce Ex
change declaring that that organization
would continue business under the new
law only in the capacity of a free associa

kinds of produce are generally fixed. Be
sides objecting to these restrictions there
are numerous other regulations to which
the boursiers take exception â all of them
bearing the impress of a common aim to
assist the agrarians by preventing Bourse
operators and dealers from depressing
prices. These regulations give the bill
the character of an entirely new experi
ment in econony, and outside the ranks
of the agrarians the bill is regarded as
being utterly Impracticable.

AfÂ»a Western Cities I'ia appointed by the
Singer* Antics.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 2.-Nine
Western cities have crows to pick with
Mme. Nordica. They are San Francisco,
Sacramento, Salt Lake City, Oakland,
Denver, Omaha, Portland, Tacoma and
Seattle. She was booked for one concert
in each during this month and next, ex
cept San Francisco, where she was to give
two. Choruses and oratorios were being
rehearsed for the events, when, a few weeks
ago, the dates were all canceled and it Â«vas
announced that an entirely new tour had
been arranged for Mme. Nordica by Messrs.
Klaw Â«t Erlanger.
i? ince then a report has gained currency
that Mes-rs. Ruben & Andrews, who have
been Mme. Nordica's business representa
tive?, had fallen out with her over the
cancellation of the Western dates and that
lesal proceedings were to be instituted
against her.
"We have no quarrel with Mme. Nor
dica," said Ruben yesterday. "The
Western bookings referred to were made
by Mr. Wilson on his own account. His
contract, which we signed for Mme. Nor
dica, called for ten concerts at $1000 each.
Jt was stipulated that on or before Decem
ber 10 Wilson should deposit to Mme.
Nordica's account $2000 in an Omaha
bank. He failed to do so and that was the
cud of it. Then he advised Mme. Nordica
to accept the Klaw & Erlanger proposi
tion."
Wilson said last evening that he was
notified on December 5 by a friend who
was looking alter the New York end of bis
business that Mme. Nordica had decided
to break her .contract with him and go
with Klaw & Erlanger.
"There was no trouble about my having
the $2000 to deposit. I am at a loss to
account for Mme. Nordica's treatment of
me."
When asked if he thought of suing
Mme. Nordica he replied that he was not
prepared to say.

INDUSTRIES THAT

Flax, Hemp and Their Man
ufactures Are Con
sidered.
William Rutherford of Oakland
Suggests Changes in the
'â¢â¢.".,. Tariff Law.
Increased Duties Required in the
Competition With Foreign Paupar
Labor.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 2. -To-day
was the fifth day of the tariff hearing
, before the House Committee on Ways and
Means, the 'subject of discussion being
"Flax, Hemp and Their Manufactures."
There was quite a large attendance of per
sons interested in those industries.
The first manufacturer to be heard was
William Rutherford of Oakland, Cal., who
Baid that in California they were engaged
in making : twine, yarn and cloth in a
great many varieties. The first of these
mills was started there about thirty years
ago and within that time the business had
increased largely. They now wanted a
reasonable protection to run their mills
and 'he suggested such changes in
the tariffas -were considered necessary for
the purposes. The manufacturers of Cali
ornia, he said, in the last election had
given their voies for protection, thinking
this the., quickest way to give emuioymeat
for the idle, '.protection to themselves and
revenue., to the Government. The mills of
the United ' States had been active in
keeping down the price of these goods to
the farmers. â¢Up to the passage of the
Wilsonbtli a fair-duty had teen given the
industry.. . â¢
The,, measure, benefited the mills of Cal
cutta .arid other foreign countries at the
.'expense' of .the. domestic manufacturers.
Between 1893' and 1895 the imports of jute
and burlaps more than douuled. Under
thÂ£ clause in the free list admitting cotton
â bagging .'and -certain goods made of bur
laps,, importers. were bringing in cloths of
. various .kinds, including horse and car
riage robes. -This was not fair nor the in
tent of:the act,' but rhe words "all such
materiel 1 ' used in the act enabled the
goods to be brought in. The makers of
mixed jute and cotton goods suffered from
this. He had called the attention of the
customs officials to it and he understood
that they now had the matter under con
sideration. â¢
"One _of the oldest plants in the United
â  States,' established at Black Point, Cal.,
'durinEf'the war, had been taken down and
'..transferred to Japan. He Had been ad
visedto transfer his plant to Yokohama,
â¢ treing iold that he could get his labor at
from 6.t0 12 cents per day and his coal for
about 90 cents per ton. But he had found
that- foreigners could not hold property in
. Japan a-nd therefore he had to give up that
idea. â â¢
The sufnming up of Mr. Rutherford's
statement was the suggestion of the fol
lowing rates in the new tariff:
"Burlaps of any width, ot flax, jute or
hemp Or of which flax, jute or hemp, or
either of them, shall be the component
material of chief value (except such as
may be suitable for cotton), \% cents per
pound ; bags for grain, made of burlaps, 2
cents per pound."
He" presented a .comparative statement
of the cost of making burlaps in the United
States, and in India, showing that the
total cost in the United States is 6.46
cents per pound and only 463 cents in
India/ or a difference of 1.83 cents per
ponnd in. favor of India. It was partially
to- make up this disadvantage against
American manufactures that the increase
in duty was necessary.
. Mr. expressed the hope that
the present conditions would be changed
by the fixing of a tariff sufficient to pro
tect the industrious citizens of the United
States in- their respective fields of useful
ness.
The chairman inquired of Mr. Ruther
ford whether his industry had been suc
cessful after the passage of the tariff act of
â 1890. -
Mr. Rutherfordâ Yes, sir. The duty
was taken fn that account off the raw ma
terial, and that gave us an assistance of
about 15 per cent per ton on jute. We
we're never better off than Irom 1890 to 1895
when the Wilson tariff act was passed.
"I suppose that your enterprising young
men," Mr. Payne suggested, "were
not going then to control America as they
are now."
"No. sir," Mr. Rutherford replied.
"California is a peculiar place. It has
warm weather nearly sll the year and peo
ple find no inconvenience in living in
tents. " So the idle people, the 'Industrial
Army,' as they called themselves, came
Irom the north |and south and located
near San Francisco. I was one to help to
feed them and to provide accommodation
for them; and we were very glad to get
them away, for their presence there was
very serious. That was the beginning of
our trouble, when all these mills and in
dustrial enterprises stopped."
The chairman stated that up to the tariff
act of 1891 some two million dollars of
â¢revenue had been derived from burlaps
and that that amount of revenue had
â¢been thrown away.
Crawford Lyon of Baltimore was the
next speaker. Hebepan by characterizing
, the last witness as a misleader and alarm
ist.' and he contradicted a statement of
Mr. Rutherford's as to the admission of
jute fabrics free of duty. The interest in
which he himself appeared wa3 that of
oilcloth and linoleum.
The oilcioth and linoleum business here,
he said, was la the hands of a few compa
nies. Any increase in the present duties
would prohibit importations and place
the makers here in a position to ''squeeze"
the public, an opportunity they have
never been known to overlook. The cost
of making these products was nowllower
than ever before, and in addition the im
provement of machinery enabled one em
ploye to do a great deal more work.
Mr. Rutherford replied that he did not
object to being caiied an "alarmist," but
.he wouid not submit to being character
ized as a misleader, and he went on to
argue that he was right in his original
statement.
Jotui Wilson of Newark, N. J., a flax
.worker, asked for the restoration of the
duties of 3 cents per j.ound on dressed
flax, with free raw material.
J. N. Bemis of Boston, representing the
burlap bag manufacturers of this country,
claimed that there was no burlap industry
here to compete with that abroad, and
therefore no industry to protect.
E. R. Biddle of New York said that the
samples submitted by Mr. Rutherford of
California as coming in free of duty at San
Francisco were paying duty at New York,
and suggested that the attention of the
Treasury Department be called to the
fraud.
C. E. Pearce -of St. Louis, representing
the manufacturers of cotton batting and
cordage, asked for the restoration of the
duty on these articles provided in the Mc-
Kinley bill.
J. W. Bell of Alden, Mass., said that his
mill did not use American flax: most of
their product came from abroad. He had
tested a sample of flax grown, he thought,
in Minnesota which had promised well.
It was only a sample, however, and had
not been manufactured. American flax,
he said, was grown more for the seed than
the fiber.
The committee adjourned until Monday,
when the tobacco interest will be heard.

BOYS LIME UP IN BATTLE.
Rival Armies Siyl/ng Themselves "insur
gents" and "Spaniards" Fight Until
the Police Arrive.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Jan. 2.â "Cuba," a
settlement in the southwest end of the
city, has been the scene of a number of
pitched battles during the past month,
between two gangs of boys who call them
selves "Spaniards" and Cubans. The
"Spaniards" are about 300 strung and the
"insurgents" about 200. The rivalry be
tween the two forces has become so strong
that they are waging bloody warfare. The
battle-ground is a marsh beyond the stock
yards, in the vicinity of the Big Four and
Belt Line tracks, and the numerous en
gagements that have taken place led the
police to-day to take a hand.
The boys are from 12 to 20 years of age.
They have formed a deadly hatred for
each other. Many of the boys have armed
themselves with revolvers, guns and other
weapons, while the balance use stones and
clubs. This afternoon the two armies
met and for half an hour they fought a
fierce battle, in which some of the boys
were badiy injured. A train of boxcars
was used by the "insurgents" as bulwarks.
A number of the boys stationed them
selves on top of the cars. They had re
volvers and several shota were fired. The
others threw rocks from behind the cars.
The "Spaniards" were behind another
train of freightcars. Occasionally skir
mish lines would venture forth, but were
driven back with showers of stones. The
two armies were in collision when the
police arrived. As soon as the boys Saw
the authorities they took to the swamps.
One boy was shot through the hand,
another through the head and another in
the arm.

NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. 2 âMusical
circles on the Pacific Ccast are evidently
very much perturbed over the pubhsned
statements that Lillian Nordica and her
concert company have canceled all con
tracts in the West and had given up any
intention of visiting that part of the
country. At the office of Klaw and Er

the firm and Al Hayman had arranged
for a tour of forty concerts, which would
positively Include the coast, although
some of the cities in which the organiza

artists, as the tour has been entirely re
constructed. San Francisco will be the
first city on the coast to hear Nordica, as
she is to appear there at the Baldwin
Theater on January 19, 21 and 23. Accom

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 2.â The Wil
son line steamer Hindoo was in collision
with the Cromwell line steamer Creole in
tl:e lower bay at 10 o'clock this morning.
Both steamers were bound out. The Hin
doo, being a heavily laden cargo ship, was
moving slowly when the the Creole over
took her, passing to the westward. The
Creole blew two whistles and attempted to
cross the bow of the Hindoo in order to
take the swash channel, but. did not allow
room enough to clear.
Although the Hindoo's engines were re
versed at full speed her stem struck the
Creole almost amidships on the port side,
carrying away the davits. The Creole
went to anchor in the lower bay after the
collision and the Hindoo returned to
quarantine, leaking forward.

NASHVILLE, Term., Jan. 3. 12:30
a. m. â LeÃreck Bros., wholesale and retail
dry goods; Grimes, Daily & Robinson,
dry goods, have been totally destroyed by
fire.
The fire originated in the second story
of LeÃreck Bros.' and spread westward.
At 12:30 a. m. a terrific wind arose from
the southwest, which fanned the flames
into a fury. The City Hall and market
house, which is located opposite the
ruined buildings, caught from sparks and
was very seriously damaged.
Burns & Co., harness manufacturers,
located on Market street, in the rear of
LeÃreck Bros., caught at 12:15 and was

quantity of good arable land to raise all
the food they need. Buildings have been
erected for the Government offices and an

sides the mountain is as inaccessible as
the Rock of Gibraltar. The mountain is

HEALTH, STRENGTH AND BEAUTY. .
\ ========^^
THE USE OF ELECTRICITY : IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY HAS BEEN .
developed to such a degree that it now forms a very large and important .
element in the treatment of all chronic, lingering and special diseases.
While it is not claimed to be a universal specific, it. is recognized as.acura- â¢' ;
-i tive agent of inestimable value, capable 'of being employed with excellent
success in the treatment of a variety of chronic diseases, and experiments .
have demonstrated that it is without doubt the most important ally yet .dis- .. ,
covered to the resources of medicine. '; - â ;. ' . â ;;;â¢â¢â¢
To be benefited by electricity it should be used only under the direct ; :
tion of a skilled physician â one who has mastered the physics^ physiology, â¢â¢
mechanics and chemistry of medical electricity; one who fully understands; .;..
r. the kind and strength of current that each case requires. â¢"-. .-.
The use of an electric current for forcing medicines through the body â  "
to diseased organs is not a new idea. It has been practiced by the medical \> '
world for a number of years, but has been used in but a very limited number'
of cases. This idea has been made a special study by the State Electro- . â 
Medical Institute doctors, and as a result of an elaborate series of experiments; ..â 
they have evolved a system of treatment that combines all the curative-.;
virtues of medicine and medical electricityâ -a. treatment that is .in- every re- ,. â¢â¢
spect and particular the most perfect and nearest infallible of any ever/dis- 'â¢
covered in the world. V . . ' 'â¢â¢.-....
The Electricity is applied either by a Galvanic, Faradic or Static batr â 
tery, or by means of Electric Belts, Body Batteries or other Electric Appliances, .-.
the variety of current and kind of appliance used in each case being of. that Â
nature which the Institute doctors deem best adapted for the speedy cure ' of â  .
the disease with which the j patient :is afflicted. The electric current" penetrates"
the body and stimulates the action of the various organs, and at the same tkne
acts ias a tonic on the nerves and the system generally. In connection with- /
the electric treatment medicines are administered. These , medicines are per- .
feet laboratory triumphs, formulated from a true appreciation of the medicinal \ .
wants of the body. Through a proper arrangement of the different poles of
the batteries on the body the electric current is made to carry , the medicines' ,
directly to diseased parts, thus hastening the curing action of the medicines, .
. \ and in a brief period the disease is conquered and the patient is restored to- '.
health and strength. #.. . . .."
â¢'; This form of treatment is new and original with the Institute.. It is trie
: elaboration and perfection to such a degree of an old idea in medical thera-. '
peutics that rit can truly be called a new scientific discovery. It is a form of- .."
treatment that especially commends itself to those who are sick" and suffering- â¢.
from chronic diseases and have failed to obtain relief from other sources;
. remedies or doctors. For this reason the Institute urges those who have used â¢ .
/'";-; â¢ electricity as applied according to old methods and ideas, or. those who have' : *.
.':''::'. \. used medicines alone, as well as those who have used both combined and â¢
;"â¢ ; have not received relief, to come and investigate the claims and. methods' of
treatment at the Institute. . .',*"â¢â¢
v It is fast becoming the Mecca of the sick and suffering, for the merit of â¢
this, new treatment as demonstrated by many cures of. cases that were re- *
garded as hopeless has earned for it an enduring fame, and daily stores of . .
people throng the Institute consultation-rooms anxious to receive the relief.
from their ills that has come to others who have taken advantage of -this â¢

Portland Boy's Affliction

Experts.
Gaining in Weight at the Rate
of About Ten Pounds a
Month.
Is but Thirteen Years O'.d and
Weighs Two Hundred and
Fifty Pounds.
PORTLAND, Ob., Jan. 2.-The atten
tion of the medical world will probably
soon be directed toward Portland, at
tracted by the case of Harry Wbitley, a
13-year-old boy, who is suffering from a
peculiar malady. His affl ction is a pre
disposition on tne part of his head, trunk
and lim-ba to grow, and so rapidly that
within a few months he has developed
into a being of gigantic proportions. His
is one of the strangest, cases on record.
The Whitiey family came from Ogden
About two months ago. They had con
sulted the best physicians in Chicago, but
. without avail. Harry's feet, which are al
ways clad in. woolen socks, are too large
for any shoe that is made. His hand?,
too, would do credit to a brawny-fisted
giant. His head and chest are won
. de.ffully developed, and he must weigh at
least 250 pounds. Mr. and Mrs. Whitley
bare other children, but they are not
.similarly afflicted.
â¢â  This .disease which has seized young
WhiUey is pronounced by medical men to
be acromegaly. The physician who is at
tending Harry says that it is a nervous
drsease and in. some way connected with
a lack ofoxygen in the system. For the
past six months the lad has been gaining
flesh at the rate of ten Dound3 a month.
, : The physician in attendance says thai
ttie'.increase in avoirdupois will be much
. greater until some successful method of
â¢ checKing the malady is devised.

at Girard'-s house, near Rawhide, on the
23d pf last mouth took place before Justice
Metzger at Jamestown this afternoon. It
â¢ resulted in the discharge of Girard a:ic<
tbe holding of Voirson to answer before
the Superior Court for the crime of
murder.
By stipulation the testimony taken in
the case of- .Voir^on was accepted by both
'.Bides in Girard's case. Otto KosKi waÂ« the
' .first witness called, his testimony tending
: to prove that the murder was entirely un
\> ovokeoL â â¢
VoSrsoa J.ook the stand and acknowl
edged having done the shooting, but
claimed that it was altogether accidental.
He exonerated Girard and said that the
latter haÂ»l nothins to do with his u-ing
the gun or taking it to his home. Girard,
on being >worn, related the facts preced
ing and alter the shooting, and staled
fhat he neither asked Voirson to take a
gun with him nor asked him to U3e it.
The District Attorney addressed the
court and siatea that he would move for
the dismissal oi Girard, as the evidence
did not, warrant his being held to the Su
perior Court, but fee asked that-Voirson
be held and a jury be given an opportu
nity to determine his guilt. Both requests
were hupplemented by FranK Street, at
torney lor t:ie prisoners, and the court
jnade the necessary orders, as requested,
discharging Girard and holding Voiraon
to answer without bail.

UNSTEADY AIM
SAVES HIS LIFE
Deputy City Clerk Winter
of Stockton Attempts
Suicide.
Fires at Himself Five Times,
but Is Only Slightly
Wcunded.
Too Much New Year's Cheer Respon
sible for the Desire to End His
Career.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 2.â George Win:
ter, the assistant City Clerk, made an in
effectual attempt at 8:45 o'clock this
morning to commit suicide at room 4,
over the Chicago saloon, by shooting him
" Belf with a revolver. He was suffering
from nervous excitement as the result ol
too much -indulgence in New Year's
.cheer.
Mr. Winter went to the saloon about
8:30 o'p'ock and entering the office in
which the public sideboard is kept called
â¢ for a class of whisky, which was given to
him by one of the bartenders. He was
not under the immediate effect of intoxi
â¢ cants at tnat time, although it proved
' later on that he was suffering from the re-
TSiilt of a spree.
''Now give me some paper," said the of
ficial as he set his glass down.
"What kind of paper ?" asked the bar
fender. â¢
." Writing-paper."
" It was for hi* death message.
â¢â¢Little dreaming of the object of the re
â  quest the bartender handed to him a
' : tablet of writing-paper, and Mr. Winter
asked for a room where he could be alone.
â¢He was directed to the private apartments
â¢ near the California-street entrance to the
place. After a few seconds he came out
and remarked that he would preler some
.- ' other ro' m. Being told that there wi:s a
â¢ lodging-house upstairs, where he coula
get a bedroom, he went up and engaged
one from the landlady, remarking that he
' would not need it more than two hours.
The proprietress, who had not been ex
pec tine so early an applicant for lodgings
' and who had an old dress on. excused her
â  appearance by saying that she Uad been
up late the preceding night and added:
rt l had too mach New Year's."
'.'I guess that's what's the matter with
me. too," replied Mr. Winter.
He stepped inside and closed the door.
Hardly a minute had elapsed when live
â¢shots rang out in quick succession from
his room. The landlady, who had gone
. â¢ to her room to prepare for the day, ran
screaming through the hall and down into
the saloon to call for help. As she reached
thtfend of the corridor Winter opened his
â¢.door and called after her.
' .. "Come back, coa'e back, I'm not hurt.
Come and see," he shouted.
But s c fled all the faster, supposing her
lodger had suddenly gone insane and that
; the next shot would be aimed at herself.
'â¢-Mr. Winter left the room and walKe^.i to
â¢ ' thÂ£ street. When the people from the
Balo'on got up to the apartment t::ey iound
on the table a note signed by the assist
â â  ant clerk and reading as follows:
J have killed myself. No explanation neces
â¢try.
this note one of the barkeepers tore up.
. .A few minutes later Mr. Winter returned
â¢ with a friend evidently in search of the
â¢ no;e. " While they were in the room the
official was heard to say to his com
pajiion:
"You have got to put me in jail or do
something with me. 1 am crazy, there's
â¢ no use talking."
â¢â¢In i he room there is a bureau with a
: large . mirror. It stands in the come
between the nnrth and east walls, and the
would-be suicide evidently stood i:i front
â¢ , of the mirror with the pistol leveled at his
bead when he fired the shots from his
revolver. â¢ All of the bullets missed him
except one. That plowed a furrow across j
his forehead. Winter was taken to jail
and charged with insanity.
Alter the attempted suicide it was j
. .learned that when Winter left the clerk's !
offijee Wednesday afternoon he informed !
'â Clerk Campbsll that he was going to col- j
' ' Ject two city licenses, amounting to about J
â¢'sloo. At 5 o'clock Mr. t'ampb 11 loikedi
"the office and went home, leaving $200 in
â¢the safe. When he opened the vault this
morniug he found that only $30 was left.
At-t he opening of the office"to-day Winter
calted on the clerk and said in effect that '
â¢"be had spent over $200 of the city money
'â at 'the gainbling tables while drunk
. .Wednesday nieht. It is supposed that he
â¢cpllect?d the $100 from the licenses and
. took $120 from the cry vault after Mr.
Campoell went home Wednesday evenintr
which would make $220 all told.
Winter is well Known all over San
Joaquin County. He is the present secre
*tary of the Democratic County Central
Committee and ha-, been a leading light in
â¢ a number of local organizations.
S/l/lf DIEGO GROWERS ACT.
Join in the Movement for an Adequate
Increase in the Tariff Rates on
Fruit Imports.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. 2.â A meeting
of fruit-growers of the county wa3 held at
the Chamber of Commerce this afternoon,
to petition for a substantial increase in
the tariff on citrus fruits. Captain A.
Keen presided.
R. H. Young, who attended the meeting
of Southern California growers at the Los
Angeles mass-meeting, explained whitt
had been done, and what was planned to
be done. He read a copy of the memorial
to ' Congress, as it had been adopted.
The question of securing adequate tariff
â¢ rales on citrus fruit imports was discussed
bj Dr. W. W. McKay, 'a. S. Crowd er. R.
C. Allen, ajid others. After considerable
talk a committee on data was appointed,
as 'follows: R. H. Young, EL C. Allen,
Colonel J. J. Fawcett, D-'wittÃ. Williams
and D. P. Hale. A tinance committee
was also appointed to circulate tne mem
orial to Congress, and also to raise funds
â¢to prosecute the work.
"We feel quite sure that we will be sue
. ces?ful in our agitation for a higher
tariff," said R. H. Young, general man
agei of the county fruit exchange, alter
the meeting. J'We have the united efforts
of all fruit-xrowers of California, for one
. thing. Then we have the advantage of
appealing lo a Congress and administra
, tion that is pledged to a ligh protective
tariff. We throw a-side all party ties and
â¢ beg. the Republican party, now in power,
to.do this for us, and as the Republicans
have the haoit of carrying out their plat
form pledges pretty well, we have every
reason to. expect that we will obtain
relief."
â  ' Jtuildinrr Up lehama County.
RED JSLUFF, Cal., Jan. 2.â ln her
quiet way' Mrs. Jane L.Stanford has un
dertaken the development of Northern
California in general, and Tebama County
in particular, in a way that is sure to be
productive of much good. She has had
burveyor H. B. Shackelford survey and
plat two of the most fertile of her proper
ties in Tehama County, the Copeland and
the Shaffer places, and has arranged to
place them on the market. Mrs. Stanford
proposes to offer this land at such prices
and in such size as will be Eiire to attract
purchasers, and thus thickly settle that
section of Tehama County and greatly
enhance the value of the University's
immense holdings adjoining.
MEXICAN RAILWAY PROJECT.
Proposed Line to Penetrate a Mountain
Through Tunnels Excavated
by Miners.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. 2.â Mexican ad
vices tell of a project now being brought
to a successful issue, so far as providing
funds is concerned, for building the first
underground railway in the republic. It
will be devoted chiefly to the development
of mines, but will also carry freight and
passengers. The road will run throu.h
the famous old mines in the mountain of
Catorce, in the State of San Luis Potosi.
For several hundred years tiiese mines
have been worked, and the result is a net
work of tunnels running in every direc
tion through the mountain, and on many
different levels. The country on the sur
face is extremely rough, and somebody
has conceived the idea of connecting
these tunnels and running a railroad
through the mountain, connecting the
Mexican National Railroad -at Catorce, on
the west, with the Porvenir de Matuhuala
Eoad at Cedral, on the east. So thor
oughly is the mountain honeycombed
with tunnels that only for a distance of
about 1800 leet must the route be exca
vated.
This project would open up the old
mines on a paying basis, besides resulting
in the developing of others on the cut
through the mountain. The projectors
are said to be English capitalists, and they
have made arrangements already tojeon
nect the railroads operating in that region.
The cost of the work will be several mil
lions.
zus ahqetjEs* GAIS.
Acquires Valuable Water Rights With
thu Park Given by Griffiths.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 2.â When
J. J. Griffiths presented to the city of Los
Angeles a 3000-acre park a few weeks ago
he gave even mon than was then believed.
With the gift were conveyed the riparian
riglits belonging to five miles of the course
of the Los Aneeles River. This is so
located that it makes the city independent
of the Los Angeles Water Company, wnich
is trying to sell its p;ant to the munici
pality for upward of $3,000,000. The city
is aiso engaged in considerable litigation
with the company, which has, it is
claimed, taken possession of the city's
water right. Lawyers now assert that this
gitt of Mr. Griffiths changes the aspect of
the situation and will po-sibly cut from
under the feet of the water company all
its ground for hoping to make the city
pay the figure it asks.
Santa Karbant Robbery.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Jan. 2.â A
tranp visited the rooms of the Ladie^' Re
lief Committee with a tale of woe yester
day afternoon. It being New Year's Uay

the price of a square meat and unknow
ingly yielded also a few New Year's gifts,
intended for applicants more worthy than
he. After leaving with his stolen booty
lie went to the Peer ess saloon and in the
absence of the barkeeper went behind the
bar and helped himself to the contents of
the cash-register. He was seen by a cus
tomer who had just entered, who informed
ihe barkeeper oi the occurrence. The bar
keeper gave chase and with the assistance
of a citizen captured the tramp and lodged
him in jail.

VICTORIA. B. C, Jan. 2.â The value of
vessels and teennical evidence as to the
cost of machinery equipment in the steam
schooners seized by revenue cutters con
stituted the maior portion of the testi
mony taken by the Bering Ciaims Com
mission during the past week. The daily
sessions have been uniiormly barren of
general interest, although some little
amusement was caused by Captain Theo
dore Magnesen, who was called 'by the
United States, and who said in cross-ex
amination that in 1390 he had made his
bsst catches in Bering Sea in September,
and those who said September was not a
good month for sealing did not know what
they were talking about.

FATAL AFFRAY AT
GOLD RIDGE MINE
Fight Between Four Men
Over the Relocation
of a Claim.
Paul Muller of San Francisco
Fires at a Foe and Wounds
a Friend.
Is in Turn Riddled by Bullets
From the Revolvers tf His
Enemies.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., Jan. I.â Paul
Muller of San Francisco was shot and
killed at Gold Ridge mine in the northern
part of this county on Thursday. The
killing occurred during a gun tight over
the relocation oi the mine. During the
fracas a miner named O'Connor was badly
wounded.
Particulars regarding the fight nre
meager. Gold Ridge Is high up in the
mountains, out of the line of travel. The
messenger who brought the news knew
only tfiat Muller and O'Oonner quarreled
with Richard Phelan and a man named
White over the relocation of the "dig
siuÂ£?s," and the dispute Jead to a deadly
combat.
Phelan and O'Connor, after a heated ar
gument, grappled. Muller drew a re
volver and fired at Phelan, but as the
weapon was discharged the struggling
men swayed to one side and the bullet in
tended tor Phelan struck O'Connor in the
breast.
Left single-handed to engage his two
opponents, Muller was at once attacked by
both. Before he could fire again he was
brought down by a bullet from White's
revolver. He arose and returned the tire,
but a second shot piefced his throat and
as he staggered back a third discharge
from the weapons in the hands of his ene
mies inflicted two more body wounds,
Muller lingered for several hours after the
fight and expired at sundown Thursday
evening. It has not been learned whether
or not his slayers have been apprehended.
O'Connor's condition is said to have been
very precarious and he may have suc
cumbed before this.
Coroner Hocking left for the scene of
the affray this morning.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Jan.
2. â A prominent member of the execu
tive committee of the student body has
received several letters from F. W. Morri
son, who is managing the glee and man
dolin clubs on their northern trip. Man
ager Morrison found it necessary to change
the itinerary by dropping Vancouver and
Victoria, B. C, on account of a change in
the time schedule of the Northern Pacific
Raiiroad. Three concerts were given in
stead in Olyinpia, Wash., Vancouver,
Wash., and Astoria, Or. The clubs en
countered something of a "frost" in Ta
coma on Christmas eve, but the concert
in Seattle Christmas evening was a great
success. The clubs had goud houses in
Astoria, Olympia and Vancouver.
Improving Sun'a Cruz Rnnds.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Jan. 2.â When the
intention of Williamson <fe Garrett to im
prove the coast road at Baldwins Hill be
came known twenty-four men, some of
them having teams, offered their services
fret for two days each. The firm, however,
offered to pay each man $1 a day as par
tial compensation. To tbil sum Super
visor EnrigM, in whose district the road
is, agreed to add another $1 per day for
each man. The volunteers will, there
fore, receive some return for their labor.
They began work to-day. Much inter
est is being manifested in road-building,
and citizens and officials alike desire that
the roa is be put into good condition at
the least possible expense to the county.
Work for All in Santa Cnm.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Jan. 2.â The Sal
vation Army seems to have settled the
tramp question so far as Santa Cruz is
concerned by the establishment of the
Shelter. To-day several additional buck
sawa are at work producing stovewood for
the market and giving employment to as
many worthy unfortunates. Genuine
tramps seem to have lost interest In Sant a
Cruz since the inauguration of long-term
sentences by the Justice courts for va
grancy, for which there can now be no
excuse. The Shelter is provided with
beds and kitchen utensils, and several
rooms in the building are comfortably
arranged for the accommodation of the
needy.

James Duffy May Die From the Effects of
His Bout With George Jus
tice.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 2. -During
one of the boxing bouts at the Broadway
Athletic Club this evening James Duffy of
Boston was so severely punished by
George Justice of the Nonpareil Club of
this city that he was carried from the
ring unconscious. Later he was removed
to St. Vincent's Hospital. The doctors
say he is suffering from hemorrhages of
the brain and will probahly die. His op
ponent was arrested and locked up to
await the result of Duffy's injuries.
Another bout of ten rounds at 110
pounds between Frank McSpadden and
Jimmy Tully was declared a draw.
The next event was between Andry
Cunlo and Billy Welsh, who fought at 125
pounds. They were booked for ten
rounds. The fight par ook of the nature
of a circus from the start, Welsh ambline
about and bounding against the ropes in
his efforts to keep away from his antag
onist. He took a prÂ«at deal of punish
ment, but before the pummeling became
brutai Police Captain Groo sent up word
to stop tne bout, and the referee gave a
decision for Cunlo.
The fourth bout was stopped in the first
round. It was between George Clare of
Long Island City and "Jim" Scully of
Providence. Scully started in to punish
his man at the start, and succeeded only
in getting himself winded. Clare had the
fight all his own way. Inspector Allaire,
who was near the ring, raised his hand
and the fight was stopped, the decision
going to Clare.
Dr. Bryant and Dr. Stewart performed
an operation on Dufly at 1 o'clock this
morning. They said " he was suffering
from cerebral hemorrnage, and they
thought his injuries, were not the result of
a blow.

Judge Hunt Delivering the Funeral Oration Over the Remains of the Late Ross Jackson at the Press Club.
ROSS JACKSON
LAID TO REST
A Great Gathering in the
Press Club
Rooms.
Friends Gather About His Bier
to Speak of Him as They
Knew Him.
It Seemed Like an Hour cf Exa'.t.d
Triumph for the D al
Journalist.
The friends of Ross Jactson said their
farewell to him â to his mortal remains â
after such a fashion as he would hare had
them yesterday afternoon.
It was a beautiful rather (ban a solemn
ceremony. By his wiÂ«h no Bign of mourn
ine met the eye anywhere. The body lay
among flowers and his friends sang sweet
sones and spoke the truth concerning
him â every word of which caused the
hearts of the throng of hearers, who were
.all his friends, to beat high and proud
resDonsively.
For they were brave, eood words that
were said of Ross Jackson, and surely it
must have soothed those upon whom the
stroke of his loss fell heaviest to hear in
what esteem he was held by all his fel
lows and how they shared in that loss.
When he said "Speak oniy the truth of
j me" he placed no limitation upon them,
as one of these friends said, "for to speak
of him as he deserves would be eulogy
enough for any man. and, in truth, if the
good wishes of genuine frien>ish:p could
have stayed the hand ot death Ross Jack
son would have lived forever."
No prayer was saia ; no minister was
there. For the dead journalist was not a
religious man, "in the churcbly sense,"
tut he had been "a living example of
that great principle, the Keystone of
Christianity, 'do unto others as ye would
' have them do unto you.' "
Just befoie he died Mr. Jackson had
asked thai Judge Hunt, a long-time
friend, should >-ay over his coffin what be
deemed righ-t to say. And so he did.
Oiher friends added what came into their
hearts to say, and other friends expressed
their thoughts iv song. Altogether it
seemed an hour of exalted triumph for
the dead man.
The rooms of the Press Club were
crowded. A very large proportion were
ladies. The electric lights were blazing.
No change had been made in the arrange
ment of the roonij in any way. The cas
ket lay in the wide aicovo and about it
were piled a mountain of flowars in many
designs, the offerings of friends from near
and far.
Shortly after 2 o'clock Judge Hunt and
the i arty chosen as pallbearers filed from
the small room on the right and took the
chairs reserved for them in the alcove at the
right of the casket. They were: Superior
Judge John Hunt; Superior Judge J. C.
b. H bbarcl ; C. M. Coe, president of the
Press Club; Arthur Barendt, representing
the Bohemian Club; H. S. Hagan, Olym
pic Club; W. W. Naughton, Exaniinor;
AVells Drury, The Cat.l; Peter Robertson,-
Chronicle; Fremont Older, the Bulletin;
Hu-h Hume. Post: T. F. Bonnet, Report,
and Captain I. W. Lees.
Immediately after the family of the
deceased emerged from the secretary's
room on tne left of the alcove that bad
been reserved for them and took chairs
racing ak ng the left of the casket. They
were:
Mrs. Jackson, John J. Raffael.lMr. andJMrs.
H. >'. Wiittely, Miss Carrie Jackson Whitely,
Miss Jackson, Mrs. A. T. Dobson.
The Press Club quartet took a station
immediately at the toot of the casket and
the burial ceremony began when their
voices took up Buck's beautiful song,
"Lead, Kindly Light."
Judge Hunt, when they hnd finished,
rose and, placing his Hand upon the
casket as one might touch caressmgly the
brow of a sleeping friend, spoke of him
who lay there beneath the flowers.
"The friend who lies voiceless in our
presence was born rifiy years ago. He |
came here in 1876. He engaged at first in
various business ventures. Subsequently
he adopted the vocation most congenial to
him and best adapted to his mental
talents, the profession of journalism. As
a newspaper man he commenced at the
foot of the ladder, whence by untiriugzeal
and enertry he rose to au honorable posi
tion, subsequently occupying the posLion
of city editor and editorial writer on our
local journals. It was said of him by his
business associates and newspaper men
thai when in authority he was always
considerate of subordinates and while
pursuing with unflagging zeal his weary
round of duty he was e\er wi ling to assist
those who found the burdens of their
employment greater than they could bear. (
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 3, 1897.
His work as a journalist has not with
stood the all-effacing ringer of time.
'â It is unfortunate, indeed, that the
fame of the best work of newspaper writ
ers is as epheneral as smoke in air or foam
upon the wave. The span of its existence
is compassed by a single day, and the
print, however precious, scarcely survives
the issue of the paper tuat bore it.
''In writing he was affirmative, witty
and terse; with a versatility of style he
combined an original and oftentimes
unique form of expression. A few years
since he came into ar. estate, the posses
sion of which enabled him to retire from
journalism ana enjoy a deserved rest.
"At the age of 50 years, in the prime of
existence and in a period which has been
termed the youth of old age, ha pas-ed
away. After months of illness he suc
cumbed to a disease, the pain and suffer
ing of which he hopefuliy and bravely
endured. When the announcement was
made to him that his end was nigh he re
ceived the dread tidings with the forti
tude of a brave heart and said he was not
afraid to die. So during the long and
lagging hours of Wednesday last he
patiently awaited the coming of the morn
of eternity.
"Just wnen the sober twilicbt fell and
the shadows gathered abou.t and the stars
came out and the old year ebbed slowly
away into the sea of time the soul of Ross
Jacfcson went out upon the tide.
"Addison in his vision of Mirzah de
scribes to us how that pious Oriental was
taken by a good genius to a great height,
whence, as in a dream, lie saw
beneath him a broad valley, a great sheet
I of water bounded on either end Dy dark
ness and spanned by a bridge of three
score and ten arches. The vale was the
vale ot Misery, the water was a portion of
the tide of eternity and tl.e bridge was the
bridge of human life. Over the bridee
Mirzah saw a vast multitude of people
traveling in one direction, and from time
to time he saw them disappear and fall
into the tide below. A closer inspection
revealed that *.he bridge was tilled with
traps, whereon whoever stepped was lost.
At the entrance to the bridge these traps
lay thick and fast, toward the center they
were scarcer, but at the extremity of the
arches they multiplied and lay coser.
"Some disappeared in the midst of mirth
and jollity, catching in vain at the
| bridge to stay their fall; others walked
along looking heavenward and while filled
with philosophical reflections stumbled
aud fell. Others again caused airy baubles
1 and as they extended for tnem their expect
ant band to seize them, lot they fell into
the tide below.
"When Mirzah turned his eye 3 from this
sad vision he scanned the darkness which
covered the|tideof eternity, and, behold!
he saw through the darkness a multitude
of beautiful isles, covered with fruits and
flowers and sitting in the midst of the
shining seas. And upon these islands he
beheld persons garbed in robes of light,
with garlands upon their heads and rest
ing upon banks of flowers, and to his
trained ear came the melodious sounds of
singing birds, falling waters and son
voices.
"Then he turned to the genius and
asked that he too might go to those en
chanted isles, but the genius said that
none could go thither save through the
gales of death on the bridge of life.
Through tnosc gates, we trust and believe,
the soul of our departed friend has passed
to the .enciianted isle. Our brother was
not a religious man in the churchly sense
of that term, but his life, his character
and his works were a living exemplar of
tliat great principle, the keystone of
Christianity, 'Do unto others as ye wouid
have them do unto you.'
"He was a most generous man. To that
compassionate heart no hand of needy
suppliant was ever stretched in vain. He
ha.d a tear for pity, and a heart open as
day for melting charity. He was the most
companionable of men â sincere, affection
ate and affabie.
"He possessed the true spirit of humor.
Not the humor which is barbed with the
poison of malice, but a humor that was
kindly, generous and spontaneous. His
nimble wit was best exhibited in quick
and sparkling repartee. Looking back
ward over his haif-ceiitury of life we find
that our brother faithfully discharged his
role in the drama of existence. Years be
ioie the Christian era an ancient philoso
pher wrote that we are here upon a stage
where each one's duty is to perform the
part allotted to him. Though we may
consider ourselves illy suited in the cast,
yet it is our duty to perform that part,
ereat or humble, to tb.2 best of our ability,
so ihat the fault, if any there is, will lie,
not with us, but with the great disposer
of the drama.
"\Vbat wonder, then, with such a life
ana sucli a character that our dead brother
should be beloved of all ami that sorrow
should sit enthroned in the bosom of his
friends. So many kindly sentiments have
been uttered and so many gentle things
said of him that if they coold but assume
a physical form no nobler column could
be erected to his memory. Were each ex
pression of kindly regard a flower a monu
ment of roses would bloom o'er his ashes.
"And so, kind friend, loving husband,
loyal companion and gentle spirit, hail
and farewell!"
Rhys Thomas sang "Come Unto Me."
Then "Wells Drury, speaking for the
working- newspaper men of the City who
knew Ross Jackson, said:
"It has been deemed meet that some
one who was associated with our friend in
his life work, and who enjoyed his com
panionship in his hours of recreation,
siiouid bear witness to tne sierling
qualities of his character. It has fallen to
my lot to say those simple words.
"lean think of no greater praise than
to say of a man that ho was always just.
Sucn a man was Ross Jackson.
"He was always the same. His well
balanced mind was not perturbed by the
daily trials and vexations of life. It was
my good fortune to be associated with
him in the active duties of newspaper
work. He maintained the same hearty,
cheerful manner and mental buoyancy at
4 o'clock in the morning, as we were
about to separate after our labors, that he
had when we exchanged our salutatious
at the bsginning of our work.
"You see no emblems of woe about our
apartments. This is in accord with his
request. Our sorrow is not betokened by
our habiliments. It is written in our
hearts. It is not possible for human words
to assuage the grief of his stricken rela
tives and family, yet to them wo extend
our tenderest sympathy.
"You cannot forget that he was loved
by all who knew him, and in truth, if the
good wishes of genuine friendship could
have staid the hand ot death, Ross Jack
son would have lived forever. He left a
message that nothing should be said above
bis ashes but the troth. This is no nar
row limitation, for to speak of him as be
deserves would be eulogy enough for any
man.
"In conclusion I will say of him as in the
beginning, that he was a just man, hon
orable in his dealings with the world, gen
erous in his friendships and tenderly de
voted to those wlio were bound to him by
the most sacred ties that are known to
mflii."
W. W. Nsughton spoke us a fellow
worker with Ross Jackson. He said:
"Of all the opportunities that a man
may have through life of forming a just
judgment of another, of learning the kind
of man he is at heart, there could be no
better than comes with working alongside
of him in a newspaper olflfce. There is
much there to ruffle his temper and cause
him to uncover the less lovely points of
his character. It was mv luckâ l call it
luck â to worfc through several years of my
life with Ross, and 1 found him the last
day as I d:d the first day, and aii the time,
all that a man should be.
"I cannot remember of his ever enter
ing into any of those little discussions of
each other that newspaper men are prone
to affect after the hurly-burly of the day
or night is ever, and that grow out of jeal
ousy or wounded vanity. He was always
the genial, warm, big-natured man. 1
know of no one in the profession to whom I
would go with such conn lence for advice.
He was, as has been said, not a religious
man in the orthodox sense, but in his con
duct toward his fellow-men he was above
reproach. We may say farewell to him
now, knowing that after his life's fitful
fever he sleeps well."
S. Homer Henley sang Rodney's "Cal
vary." He had sang it often before in the
club rooms, olten for the pleasure of Ross
Jackson living, and now the occasion
10 uched it with a new power and fitness.
Daniel O'Oonnell read a poem of his
own writing to "Our Dead Comrade," of
which the following are the first and clos
ing verses:
Sometimes, when chatting merrily, onr friend has
na.iJ to me,
"We're moving down the sloping road on toward
tne BUDsei's glow.
How strange ie seems that all around, on every
side, we see
Tho chsff ts sparedâ the useless chaffâ the while
the wheat musi go."
Farewell! farewell! We know, we feel, if from
that other sphere
The souls of me departed may for a moment
strayâ
Just as of old you're standing among your com
riulos here,
Prouil of the tears they fain must weep for you,
dead friend, 10-day.
Arthur Barendt said the last word for
the men who knew Ross Jackson best and
gave the reason why there must be an
end, even while much remained to be
said :
"It falls to me to speak the last word on
bcbalf of the working newspaper men
concerning our friend whose body lies
here," he said. "If I may say it, Ross
Jackson was a newspaper man from the
ground up. He had all the sterling quali
ties of a newspaperman, but none of their
shortcomings. He was a man through all
the wearing trials, the vexations of the
newspaper man's life, day by day; he was
ever found the same tine, open, whole
some, manly man.
"One lortune came to him. Instead of
lifting him away from his fellows or de
stroying in him those things that had
made him beloved by them it only served
to unfold his character ana bring its
brightness and gentle kindliness into
stronger relief. But we should not tarry
here however we may feel like paying
tribute to the memory of the friend whom
we have lost, for we must not forget that
ihere are those here to whom tne cere
mony is fraught with pain. For their
sake we must bring it to an end. I may
only say in conclusion that when it shah
come our time, that of each of us, to lie
here, may as much of good be said of us
as may in truth be said of Ross Jackson ;
may as many kind, regretful thoughts
spring Irom the hearts of our fellows who
survive us."
The quartet sang "Beyond the Smiling
and the Weeping."
Then the great company of friends filed
through the room and took the r last look
at the face of their friend. The pall
bearers took up their burden and the pro
cession moved to Odd Fellows' Cemetery.
The casket was placed iv the chapel of the
crematory, and the quartet from its sta
tion in the loft sang, as a conclusion to
the beautiful ceremony, "Still, Still With
Thee."
And so, led by the principal mourners,
the company dispersed; the play, for
Ross Jackson â as he himself would say
it â was dune.
The body will be incinerated to-day.
" This company that dispersed that had
filled the Press Club rooms was a rather
remarkable one, representative of every
i*alk o: life. There were Judges and em
inent lawyers and merchants, representa
tives of necrly all the branches of the City
government and of all the professions.

BURGLARS ARE
KEEPING IT UP
Four of the Cases That
the Police Are Now
Investigating.
A Lady Chases but Fails to
Overtake a Thief Who Had
Entered Her House.
The Crimes Are B?lieved to Be the
Wcrk of Men Recently Released
From San Quentin.
Although the police have within the
past few days arrested three notorious
burglars, there are others who are keeping
the Dolice on the alert.
The police are doins all they can to keep
the burglaries secret, but the people who
have suffered a loss Irom the visits of the
burglars are not so reticent.
On Thursday evening the residence of
R. G. Green, 517 Turk street, was visited
during the absence of tne family. About
9 o'clock Mrs. Green and her niece re
turned to the house and were surprised to
rind the gas burning. Thinking that her
husband and sister had probably returned
before her she went to her sister's room,
vvhen she was startled by seeing a young
man jumping out of the window, which
overlooks an alley.
She ran to the front door to give the
alarm, and when she reached there the
burglar was running along the sidewalk
in the direction of Polk street. Mrs.
Green gave chase, and as she neared Polk
street she called to a man to stop the burg
I lar, but he paid no attention to her. The
burglar continued his flight down Polk
street and disappeared in an alley.
It was found that the burglar had stolen
Mrs. Green's gold watch, a pair of gold
earrings and a revolver. Mrs. Green de
scribes him as being about 18 years of age
and roughly dressed.
Last Wednesday night the room of Miss
Abboy, 621 Buah street, was entered, it is
supposed, by the use of skeleton keys.
Mi 3Â» Abboy was out shopping, and when
she returned the room was in disorder.
Bureau drawers had been taken out and
their contents scattered on the floor. Two
purses, a set of valuable souvenir spoons,
a pair of opera-glasses, a mackintosh and
several dresses were stolen. No one in
the house had beard any unusual sounds,
nor had any strangers been seen in the
halls.
A burglar broke into the Mentone, cor
ner of Powell and Sacramento streets,
early yesterday mornin? by prying open
a re;ir window with a "jimmy." A room
that had been occupied by a lady, who is
on a visit to the country, was entered and
thoroughly ransacked, but nothing in the
shape of jewelry or money was found. A
tin box that contained private letters had
been broken open, and the letters were j
scattered on the floor. The adjoining
room was then entered and a dres? stolen.
The burglar tried to enter othe rooms,
but they were all locked. A valuable
overcoat and umbrella were stolen from
the hatrack.
The fourth burglary on this list took
place in the room of Miss LUlie Russell,
223 a Leavenworth street. The room was
entered early Tuesday morning, and a seal
skin coat, a handbag, platinum and gold
watch chain and other articles of thevelue
o! $400 were stolen. It is supposed that
the burglar had utilized a skeleton key to
get access to the room.
These are only a few of the recent burg
laries lenorted to the police, and it is sur
mised that several burglars, who have been
discharged from San Quentin after serving
out their sentences, are doing the work.
NEW BUSINESS MANAGER
The Dally Journal of Commerce Se-
cures the Services of a Local
Newspaper Man,
D. W. Fraser, formerly of the business
department of Thb Call and more re
cently employed on tha staff of the Wasp,
will commence the new year as manager
of the business office of the Daily Journal
of Commerce.
In selecting this gentleman for the re
sponsible position, which he assumes to
to-morrow morning, the proprietors of
the commercial journal have not made a
mistake, as he carries with him a varied
experience in commercial lines which will
prove invaluable to his new employers.
Mr. Fraser has turned out some credit
able work in both the business and liter
ary ends of the newspapers with which he
has been connected here, and his appoint
ment to the new office will no doubt be
a popular one among the newspaper men
and advertisers of the City.
HE WILL RECOVER.
William Healey. Sbot by His Brother-
In-I.H\v, Is Doing Well.
Albert F. Davis, the barber, who shot
his brother-in-law. William Healey, at
Twenty-sixth and Mission streets, Friday
night, appeared in Judge Low's court yes
terday morning to answer a charge of
assault to murder. The case was, by con
sent, continued till January 6.
Healey is doing well at the City and
County Hospital, and Dr. Lowell, who is
attending him, says he will soon ba all
right again. His escape from death was
almost miraculous.
A Shock That Proved Fatal.
Information was received at the Coroner's
office yesterday of the death of Mrs. Cnlista
Greenleafof 73G Snotwell street. Last Thurs
day the lady, wno was 86 years o: age, tell
downstairs aud received injuries that resulted
i:i her death. It was more the shock than the
injuries taat caused death.

money brokers, obtained warrants in Judge
Campbell's court yesterday for trie arrest of J.
i

HARRY HART HAD
AN AWFUL FALL
Dropped From the Third
Floor of the New West
ern Hotel.
Injured Severely by the Shock,
but He Has a Chance to
Recover.
Harry Hart, a bartender at the New
Western Hotel on Kearny and Washing
ton streets, met with an accident in the
hotel yesterday, that will probably cause
his death. He fell over the bannister of
the stairs leading to the third floor and
was crushed on the floor thirty-fa've feet
below.
He was picked up unconscious and re
moved to St. Mary's Hospital, where it
was found that his skull was badly frac
tured. Ris left thigh, left leg and his
nose were also broken. He was on the way
to his room on the third floor, and as he
ascended the stairs he pulled the weight
of his body up and alone by grasping the
bannister.
This guard to the stairway is none too
high and the fact was called to Hart's at
tention by James Ryan, the porter, wbo
called to him and said that if he was not
more careful he would, have a fall. Hart,
who was near the top of the stairs,
laughed at the warning, but a second
later be lost his balance. His right leg
swung around, passing over the bannister,
twisting the man's bands off the wood
work. Hart fell head downward and
struck on his left side. The noise of the
fall was heard all over that part of the
floor, and those who rushed inio the hall
way to see what had happened were sure
that Hart had been killed outright. A
physician was called, who said there was
still hope, and Hart was sent to the
hospital for the best of care. It is found
that be sustained internal injuries as well.
Hart is 35 years of a?e, his last birthday
falling on the first day of the year. H*
has been in the hotel for the past five
years.
The Kvolution of Donkeys.
In a small town in North Wales the
Town Clerk and a local auctioneer met in
a pubHc house last Christmastide. They
were having a quiet chat, wheii the auc
tioneer espied Pat pass by.
Thinking he could have a joke at Pat's
expense he called Dim in and said :
"They tell me you are good at conun
drums."
"Shure, I'll have a flop at one," said
Pat.
"Can you tell me," said the auctioneer,
"how there are so many more donkeys in
iiigypi man in waits r
â  "I can easily answer that, sot," said Pat.
"In JSgypt they let them be donkeys lor
ever, while . in Wale* } they make â  auction

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 3, 1897.
FINANCIAL PANIC
AMONG JAPANESE
Thousands of Stock Com-
panics Floated, hut
Collapsed.
Cogent Reasons Why American
Dealers Are Handicapped
in Japan.
The Burean of Foreign Commerce, re
cently organized by the Chamber of Com
merce of San Francisco, ha- just received
from its special agent to Japan and China,
W. R. Townsend, the report published
below, which will be fouad replete with
interest to all connected with the indus
tries arid commerce of California. The
news of an order from Japan for ei<;hteen
American locomotives is especially so.
Yokohama, Dec. 10, 1896.
William Jf. Bunlcr, Exq., Chairman, and Mem
bers Bureau of Foreign Commence, San Fran
ciscoâDear Sirs: I have been here about one
month, and wnile 1 have sent your chairman
some.data wnii reference to matter* affecting
the interests of San Francisco manufacturers,
I have not heretofore made an official report
and feel now that my limited experience has
not given me much of any information which
mischtbs considered of great value.
There has been almost a panic in Japanese
financial circles during the last two months,
although tJ?e worst is considered over.
After their war with China speculation was
rampant. Thousands of stock companies were
floated and the stock 3 boomed. Everybody
I invested, but the collapse enme. The nntive
banks shut down indisc.-iminn.tely recently,
and merchants doing a legitimate business
were allowed no accommodations. This had
the effect of throwing heavy stocks of mer
chandise buck onto tho hands of tne foreign
houses, ana the Yokohama and Kobe godowns
(warehouses) lire crowded to overflowing. â 
Over 70 per cent of the import business of
I this couniry is still in the hanos of foreign
housesâ English. German, French and Ameri
can. Five years ago they did 85 per cent ot
the business, but the Japanese aro gradually
securing more and more of it.
While very little credit is given the Japanese
by the importer?, goods being almost in
variably paid for against delivery order, still
heavy stocks are otten imported upon con
tracts, recommendation or advice of the
Japanese, and the tightness of the money mar
ket has prevented these goods moving out
freely.
It did not take me long to tell why America
enjoys (?) so small a percentage of the import
business of Japan. At a rough estimate 75
per ceat of the foreigners doinu business here
are English, German, French, etc.. and the
majority of these are branches ot shipping and
commission houses in their own countries.
Tney are sent out here to locate, and the ob
ject is to introduce and sell goods produced in
their respective countries.
They soon found out that the Japanese did
not look to quality; they wanted the cheapest
of the kind, and when they wanted any par
licuiar kind it was specially made for this
market. The few American houses hert> have
struggled to throw the trade to America and
succeeded in a measure when quality was
want (I, b.it they soon found that li they wure
to succeed financially they would have to
handle that which would pay them best.
BThe manager of tue largest American house
here, which probsb'y does as much import
business as all the other Americans togetner,
toil* rue that 80 per cent of the goods they
handle come irom England and Germany, and
it Is strictly a question of cost, freight and in
surance as against America.
Freight from England and Continental
Europe by steamer is cheaper than the lowest
rates on any commodity from the Pacific
Coast, less than half the distance away, and
when you come to add our freights where are
you? The bulk of aU the cotton whicn comes
to Japan from the Southern States reaches
here via Europe; but this is being changed.
All of the Japanese merchants I have met
and talked with teil me that the Americans
are more popular here than any other nation
ality, and, Appreciating the fact that we are
the largest buyers of their products and me
smallest shippers of our own, say they would
like to do more business with us and welcome
any movement which will tend to bring about
a changed state of these affairs. I had a long
and most interesting taik the other day witu
Mr Shibusawa, president of the Chamber of
Commerce and First National Bank of Tokio
and director in about thirty different com
panies.
There was & convention of delegates in ses
sion at Tokio â representatives of sixty different
Chambers of Commerceâ and he explained to
them the object of my mission, and siiid they
were ail giad to know that there was a pros
pect of increased business between Japan and
America.
While there is a temporary stringency in the
money market, there is no disposition to let
up on industrial progress. Every day new
companies are formed and new projects
started. A railroad congress will bu heid,
commencing December 14, aud lasting prob
ably two months. Already 100 applications
for charters for new railroads have been tiled,
but it is stated that not over forty will be
granted, and if half of these railroads are built
in the near future it ought to mean a great
deal of business for America.
Contracts were made last week for eighteen
American locomotives â six each fpom three
different manufacturers. Most of the rolling
stock one sees is English.
I wrote you thai tne new Japan and German
treaty provided thÂ»t citizens of the latter
country could Hie their applications for trade
marks and patents, and this has been taken
Advantage of on trademarks to the numDer of
200, and I presume Americans will be granted
the same privileges as soon as Congress au
thorizes our Minister here to ask for it, but
you will note from an inclosed clipping from
v local paper that the restrictions as to patents
are going to take ft way practically all the
chances of securing any protection unless the
invention Is new and unknown in Japan.
1 do not imagine that Germany will submit
to any such decisions as the JnnmioÂ»Â« pttent
office has made and naturally Englnnd and
America will reseut such an attempt to cut
out protection ior the inventions of their
respective subjects.
Since this lettt-r was commencpd I have been
invited by the president of the N:phon Boyeki
Kyokai (Japanese Trading Association) to
address the members Ht tneir next monthly
meeting, December 16, at Tokio, on the sub
ject of my mission to Japan and have agreed
to do so.
The invitation explains that this is a club
or society of higher class merchants, who are
intere-ted in fostering foreign commerce, and
a full meeting of the me. chants is expected. I
am going to give them some^jrood advice
abou i establishing a higher grade bCcommer
cial morality before they can expect to control
the foreign commerce of their own country.
I have just settled in very convenient offices
in tne business center of Yokohama and after
the turn of the year hope to be able to begin to
show results. Respectfully submitted.
W. R. TOWNSEND.
THE DRUMMER'S LATEST.
In the Theater He Had More Fan Than
"Wag! Intended.
The drummer always brings the latest
trick. Here it is:
Take a spool of white basting cotton.
Drop it into your inside coat pocket, and,
threading a needle with it, pass it ud
through the shoulder of your coat. Leave
the end an inch or so' lone on the outside
of your coat and take off the needle. Four
men ctu of five wili try to pick that whole
thread off your shoulder, and will pull on
the spool until ie actually does seem r.s
though your clothes are all bastings and
that they wera unraveling not only your
clothes, but yourself.
"I was to see Wilson Barrett in Clauiiien
in Boston last week," said the traveling
man. "It was in the most interesting and
pathetic portion of the play. Everybody
wa- rapt. I was sitting bolt upright and
dint know or care to know a soul around
me, when suddenly I felt some one tug
ging at the busting cotton that I myself
had clean forgotten. I didn't say a word
and did not move. Foot by foot it un
rolled. Half glancing around I saw a
manâ a total strangerâ yanking at the
thread, His face was scarlet He had
pulled out about ten yards and was now
hauling in hand over hand. He didn't
care to stop, because lie had decorated mv
back and the whole aisle was basting cot
ton. He hardly dared to go ahead, for he
didn't know what portion of niv domestic
interior economy he was trifling with.
Rip! rip! wett the thread/ .Hand over
hand he yanked it in. The aisfe was full
"i- '* or heav en's sake! will it never
end? said he above his breath.
â¢â¢I *Xt perfectly still and ran the spool
while he pulled. How I wanted to yelil
I never saw anything half so funny. Tba
whole section of the house got on to it.
1 hey didn't know whether to laugh at me
or him, but sat and looked on, amazed at
the spectacle. At last tne stranger gave
one frantic rip and yanked out about
eleven yards in one bunch, and as the cot
ton got twisted around his watch-chain,
over his eyeglasses, in his hair and tilled
his lap, 1 turned around, and producing
the spool from, my pocket, said: 'I am
sorry I misled you." You se<Â», I have about
124 yards left, but I presume tkat you
don't care for any more to-night. I am
j honestly sorry, but I rant, help smiling.'
"The man was a modest sort of gentle
man in appearance. His face was as red
as Cue even to iiis ears. He looked at me
and then at the spool. He changrd color
once or twice, and when the crowd caught
on a big laugli went up."â American Com
mercial Traveler.

changes in this vicinity, will be shown on the
next edition of the coast survey chart.

hydrography at the entrance to Humboldt
Bay across the br.r has changed materially
from thai shown on the charis. While 31 feet

is not as now located. A 15-foot shoal has
formed near the middle of the entrance, and
vessels should not cross the bar without
local know. edge.
Oregon (Coquille River entranceâ Buoy
movedâ New rucks and breakers).â A recent
examination by Ferdinand Westdahl, United
States Coast and Geodetic Survey, off the en
trance to Coquille River, has resulted in the
following changes, which have been added to
the coast survey charts: The red nun-buoy
marked "Coquille," in white letters, is now
shown miie X. 3 dee. E. true (N. by W. %W.
mag.) lrom its old position.
Coquille rock is saown 1-32 mile N. 65 deg.
E. true, (NE. magnetic), from its old position.
The breaker irom this rocii is very well de
fined and very heavy. It is reported that
nothing Jess than three fathoms has been
found on it by fishermen. The shape of the
rock, judging from the character of tne break,
is flat-topped and wall-sided.
A small pinnacle rock 1 7-32 miles S. 84 deg.
30 mm. w. true, (S\V. by \V. %W. magnetic),
from Coquille River lighthouse. The break
from this rock is well defined and of rare oc
currence, and may have a least depth of six
feet over ir.
A rock with two heads about 10 yards apart,
1 3-lti iniies &80 deg. \\. true, (BW. by W, %W.

The break from th:s rock is very much Jike
the last meiuionea, but is more frequent.
The Bundon iiio-savmg crev. - report having
seeu the lop of one of the last two mentioned
rocks, but do not know which of the two it
was.
A large rock 1 23-32 miles S. 75 dep. W true
(3W. % \V. mag.), in-:n Coquiile River light
house, which has a very heavy break.
A rock 1 11-16 miles ri. 70 deg. \V. true (SW.
% \V. mag.), from Coquiile River lighthouse.
Judging from its breaK ii is supposed to have
less than 4 fathoms of water over it and to be
very ragged.
Wasli Rocks, as shown on the chart, was
found to be â¢ single rock 1 40 miie N. 73 deg.
E. true (NE. 3Â£ E. may.) from the northern of
'lie Wash Rocks, it has been frequently seen
in the trough of a swell, and breaks con
stantly.
It has been noticed by members of the iife
saving crew that the steamers bound for the
northward in heavy northwest weather fre
quently pass inside of the outer b;ioy, the red
nun marked "Coquiile." This is very danger

dangers that have been located.

Frenchmen With Oeruaau Decoration*.
Vanity rises superior to patriotism,
and no matter how bitter the feeling may
be In France against the invaders of 1870,
there are numerous Frenchmen, not
irerely civilians and diplomuts, but even
officers of the army, who have accepted
decorations and orders if knighthood from
the Emperor of Germany and from the
rulers ot Bavaria, Saxony, VVurtemberg
and Baden. A few such as, lor instance,
the late Embassador Herbette at Berlin,
have declined distinctions of this kind
tendered to them, but their action was,
as they tnemselves explained, duo to the
fact that the orders were not ot sufficient
lank to accord with their ideas of their
own importance. Several of the prede
cessors of Embassador Herbette at Berlin
gladly accepted the Star of the Black
EagJe on leaving Berlin, and it would be
diflicult to find any Fiench diplomat
who has been stationed at any German
court whose breast is not adorned with
some Teutonic decoration. Under tlie
circumstances, the statement contained
in the cable dispatches to the effect that
Dr. Ro-ui is the first Frenchman to have
accepted a tierman order of knighthood
since the war must be regarded as open to
question.â New York Tribune.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 3, 1897.
ARE BUTTE'S MEN
ALONE OFFENDERS?
Comments on the Status of
Local Amateur Ath
letes.
Why Humphrey Has Declared
the Montana Players
Professionals.
They Vainly Ofered to Play Two
More Charity Games to Be
Reinstated.
The Butta-Olympic football game on
New Year's day, with its questions and
disputes over professionalism, has given
rise to a serious discussion of amateurism
and the status not only of the Butte play
ers but of some nearer San Francisco.
On the occasion of the game President
TV. F. Humphrey of the Pacific division of
the American Amateur Athletic Union
notified the Butte team tnat in deliber
ately appearing on the field reedy to play
with two men whom the union alleges to
be professionals it gave evidence of disre
gard to strict amateur rules amounting to
professional intent.
He had advised the team to go into the
game without those two men, but Butte,
inviting a protest that would nullify the
came as a match, lined up, expecting that
Olympic would afterward consent to an
exhibition charity game in which the ath
letic standing of the participants cuts no
figure. Then Butte would enter its regu
lar team in its full strength.
Humphrey thereupon declared all the
Butte men in the line-up professional
athletes. Then the so-called exhibition
oractice game was played in such friendly
rivalry and gentleness that five men had
to quit the fi-ld, and time had repeatedly
to be allowed for others to recover suffi
ciently to continue the furious contest.
The particular rule* upon which Presi
dent Humphrey based his decisions in de
claring the Butte players professionals
and in permitting the exhibition game
occur in a series of recently adopted arti
cles defining what constitutes an amateur.
The two clauses, literally aud without the
general introductory, are given below.
Tiie hirst defining an amateur, says he is:
One who has never competed knowingly or
intentionally with professionals or in a com
petition in which professionals have com
peted, or who has never received from any
clut) of which he has been a member remission
of his entrance fee and annual dues, or who,
for any cause whatever, has never h'ld such
fee and dues remitted, or has not been re
quired to pay thtm.
The other clause, apart from its context
but self-explanatory , reads:
The prohibition of this article shall not be
construed to debar the teams of union base
ball and football clubs from playing profes
sional teams, provided that no member of a
union club shall receive any share ot the gate
money or compensation under anygui.se what
soever for participating in any such game.
Such, in part, was Humphrey's author
ity, and there can be no question that he
did his official duty and would have been
remiss hud he tacitly ignored the earlier
acuou of the other branches of the union
thai had declared the two Butte men pro
fessionals, for professionals they would
have to be considered until properly rein
stated.
The gate receipts, amounting to between
$1200 and $1500, are to go to charity. To
what particular charity was not stipulated,
though since the game both the Examiner
and the Chronicle, it seems, have offered
to assume the responsibility of distribut
ing and announcing their distribution of
the funds.
The money will, however, be distributed
directly by the local representatives oi the
amateur union and to such charitable
organization-- a3 they may at their meeting
next Friday evening decide to favor. It
will probably be divided equally among
several of the more deserving institutions
of this City.
At present the gate receipts are In
charge of C. J. Boswortb, one of the Olym
pic manager*, but he is resttained Dy an
order issued yesterday by Humphrey of
the Amateur Union from disposing of any
part of them, except a matter of about
$175 lor rent and prepaiation of the
grounds for the games.
Yesterday ioreuoon Manager McMillan
of the Butte team called upon President
Humphrey and offered to play two
more matches with any team whatever
and absolutely for charity, if he would re
call his ruling making all the Butte play
ers professionals, simply because they
had, upon the orders of their acting cap
tain, lined up with two avowedly dubious
amateurs in their team.
Humphrey did not see that any con
cession would alter the case. But Mc-
Millan was persistent. He had received a
telegram from Millionaire Clarke oi Butte,
president of the fooiball club, advising
him to get another game in San Fran
cisco, so that the te:im might come home
to Montana victorious. McMillan offered
to play Oiynipic another charity game,
but the manager refused.
Word came to Humphrey that Reliance
would play Butte lor charity, but the in
formation* did not reach the Bulte team,
which left this side of the bay in its
private car at 4 o'clock in the aftornoon
and soon afterward was speeding north
ward from Oakland with the Oregon ex
press.
Speaking yesterday of his ruling Presi
dent Humphrey said:
"When 1 explained the matter to the
Bntte men beiore the game all seemed
satisfied but Benson, the acting captain.
1 hey said: 'We can't ask you to let Las
well play; we know he is a professional.
But can't you allow Hall to play?' Then
they became inconsistent by lining up
with those men, and in doing so showed
professional intent. I told them then that
I must declare them professionals. I have
no doubt the board of managers, at its
meeting ne^t Friday night at the Olympic
Club, will uphold my ruiing, though it
may not, as there are twenty-five mem
bers to consider my opinion. The question
of the status of the Butte team will be
taken up at that meeting."
Then President Humphrey went on to
remark upon the prevailing ienorance on
this coast of what a cure amateur is. He
hinted at some thorough investigations to
be male into the status of all athletes at
both the universities. He said that he
objected to the recent transfer of Reliance
players to the Olympic team. He con
siders the employment by any strictly
amateur organization of persons not bona
fide members a manifestation of lainess
amounting to professional intent, he
had heard it stated that the names of
several men who have represented both
the big athletic clubs this seacon are asso
ciated with those clubs solely as football
players and neither as paying nor honor
ary* members, recorded upon the official
register as active members.
He declared that the union bad not rec
ognized the recent boys' coast champion
ship baseball games as amaieur contests,
and he regretted thar in one of the final
games the members of two of the teams
were made professionals by arranging a
special game, the proceeds of which were
distributed among the players.
In connection with college athletics be
mentioned that it' what he has heard be
true Eklgren, the weight-thrower, i 3 not
properly a representative of the Univer
sity of California, except for intermittent
registration at the art school previous to
intercollegiate field days.
GOLD IS ON THE GROUND.
Randsburg Oae of California's
Greatest Mining
Camps.
J. W. K^lly Says More Gold Is Scat
tered Over the Surface There
Than Anvwhsre Eise.
John W. Kelly, a well-known mining
man of the State, is in the City on busi
ness and will return to Randsburg Hnd
Inyo County in a day or two. Mr. Kelly
has rich mining properties in both Kanus
burg ana Inyo County. Speaking of
Kandsburg he said:
1 "There is more gold scattered over the
surface in Kandsburg than in any camp I
was ever in. I think that ('aiiforn a ami
the West promise to have there one of
the richest camps. Every man who has a
cluim in the belt feels himself a million
aire. It is being watched by mining men
from Montana, Colorado and Nevada.
"Amons the richest properties are
those owned by the Rand Company and
P. Reddy & C 0.," he said. "One of the
best of these is the Olympus chute of ore
which runs $30 to the ion. There are
twelve claims in the Rand Company
group. Ricti seams run all over the hill
appareir.ly tending toward the Olympus
oru body. They j:et ore hauled ana
m lied lor $8 50 per ton.
"Otner rich liuds are the Kenyon,
Wedge and Butte properties. Tuu K< n
yi'ii has mi. lei ore iroiu a depth of 70
feet, being taken G feet wide irom tne vein,
and it runs $116 per ton. The St. Elmo,
owned by Bjkersfield partie , is six miles
from Randsburg, in the M >jave desert.
Some very rich ore has been taKen out
there. It is risrhi in the desert. A pros
pector in passing the spot hit a big bowl
der a clip, picked up the piece he knocked
off, and there it was â rich quariz.
"Rundsburg is a typical mining town'
and is growing vory rapidly. The popu
lation is now between 1500 and 2000 people,
and more are coming in every day.
Buildings are going up rapidly. A da.ly
newspaper was started iwo or three weeks
ago. Squatters have settled on some
placer claims, and there may. be some
trouble over it some day, but it has not
appeared yet. These claims are taken up
ana are in the town."
Mr. Kelly has some rich copper veins in
Ir.yo County. He will go there and start
the work of opening them up before he
goes 10 KaiidsburÃ.

POOL DENS ARE
FINALLY CLOSED
Supervisors Put the Stamp
of Their Disapproval
on Them.
A Unanimous Vote of the Board
in Favor of the Poolroom
Ordinance.
Betting Can Only Be Carried On
Within the Confines of a
Racetrack.
Tlie Board of Supervisors crushed out
the disreputable dens about town where
young men and boys have been gambling
away their own and their employers'
money by finally passing the poolroom
ordinance yesterday.
When the board placed the stamp of its
approval on the measure a few weeks ago
and decided that the bucket-shops must
go out of business, it was supposed that
the Mayor, as a matter of course, would
sign it at once, inasmuch as it was desired
by the business community as well as by
the better element of sporting men, who
attend horserace meetings more for the
pleasure of seeing a well-contested race
than for the betting that is a usual accom
paniment.
The retiring chief executive, however,
held the ordinance thefuil time permitted
by law and then sent it back to the board
without his signature, thus informing the
board that he did not approve of the
measure.
It was understood at the time the mem
bers heard that the order was to be vetoed
that the Mayor's course would not be
sustained, and yesterday's proceedings
carried out this view.
The board met iv the morning and
passed the ordinance to print over the
veto.
In the afternoon when the measure had
been printed in the official newspaper as
required by law the board met again and
by a unanimous vote finally declared the
ordinance a nece&sary one, and made it a
municipal law.
Mayor Sutro's motives in vetoing the
order nave been severely commented on
by those who recognize the demoralizing
influences of the pool-selling dens. It is
freely said that his only reason is because
the railroad which he chooses to consider
his ancient enemy has two lines of road
running to the racetrack where many of
the patrons of the track will go now that
the poolrooms are to be closed.
These dens have brought more or less
odium on the horse racing and raising in
terests that have brought capital and en
terprise to this coast, and the mercantile
community will feel heartily glad that
they are not to be permitted to nourish.
Messenger-boys, errand-boys, clerks and
others, who have neither time nor money
to spare, were permitted to gamble, while
the odds posted in these deadfalls, the
sharks who lived off their earnings or pil
fering accepting wagers down to a two
bit piece in their eagerness to keep up
their nefarious business.
The genuine sporting men, who go to
races to see a spirited contest, never low
ered themselves to enter the dens, and
they as well as the rest of the community
will say, 'Good riddance to bad rubbish."
The people of Puns are h.ppophagus to
a remarkable de-Tee, consuming on an
average over 20,000 horses and donkeys
annually. Ls^t year, according to the re
turns, the Parisians ate 23.396 horses, 439
donkeys ami 86 mules. This horse, dun
key and mule tiesh dressed ready for the
butcher's block weighed 5879 tons, and
was sold at prices varying from 3 sous to 1
franc per pound, the latter being the price
paid for the best horse steaks.

PRICE $5 AND UPWARD.
DR. BANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT IS NOT A CHEAP BELT. NO BELT]
made as well as it is made can be sold cheaply. It is perhaps the highest-priced]
â  Electric Belt in the world, because it is the best; and ; yet it is sold as low as $5,
and at this price is warranted far superior to any other Electric Belt made. Dr. San-
den's $10, $15 and $20 Belts have all the latest improvemen ts known to science. Every
Dr. Sanden Electric Belt is guaranteed for one year, and $5000 will be forfeited for one!
which will not generate a current of electricity strong enough to be felt by the wearer
as soon as placed on the body. .
â¢ Compared with the cost of drugs or doctor bills this famous Electric Belt, which]
has done so much good service, is very cheap. Five dollars" invested in this way wilt
be worth ten times â aye, a hundred â more than the same amount in medicine.
SEE THE CURES.
These are extracts from letters recently received: â¢ .
"I had a continual pain in my back and up my spine for three years until I got this Belt
from you. I put it on at night and it gave me relief right away.- I can now sleep sound,
which- I could not until I got your Belt. I shall always speak well of it," writes A. B-
GRAVES, 214 North Third street, San Jose, Cal., Dec. 8, 1896.
"I was troubled with my stomach for more than ten years with' terrible pains an* 1 vomit-
ing, besides other general weakness. Since using your Belt, which I got last February, I hava
been free from all those troubles," writes M. C. BECKWITH, Fresno, Cal. .
"At the time I bought your Belt I was so nervous and shaky that I could not do any work
without feeling perfectly exhausted. I had what is called Nervous Debility from excessive
drinking and other excesses. I was practically a wreck, physically and sexually. I had spent
over $300 for medicines, without the slightest benefit, when I was advised to use your Belt.
I felt an improvement as soon as I commenced to wear it and continued improving, until now
lam as strong and well as ever in my life. I feel very grateful to you for what your Belt has
done for me," says H. KNOWLTON, 621 Kearny street, San Francisco, Cal., Dec. 8.
"Fifteen years ago 1 was hurt by a fall, injuring my spine and weakening my whole sys-
tem. My power was gone. When I got your Belt last April I was so weak I could not stoop to
lift anything. I felt better in three days after putting the Belt on, and in two months my
power was entirely restored and I was cured by your Belt," says S. H. AUSTEN, mate ship
Hueneme, San Francisco, Dec. 2, 1896.

â¢very sickness. This habit, however, is giving way to the growing intelligence of thej
people, partly because they are smarter and understand better, but mostly because
they have found by experience that medicine does not care. Electricity does, and Dr.
Sanden's Electric Belt shows proof, fresh proof, of this every day.
To weak men, weak women, people who want to be permanently cured, Pr.
Sanden's Belt will prove worth its weight in gold. Get the little book "Three Classed
of Men" and see the proof of what it is doing. ' Free by mail or at the office. Call of

POPULISTS BADLY SPLIT
An Alleged Slate " Reads the
Doom of Seme of Their .
. Bright Leaders.
T. V. Ca'or, Taylor RcgT?, E S. Bar
ney, Dr. Diywilt, Go. G llespie
and J. A Jjbnsoa Are Victims.
Tne Populist County Committee met
last night at 915}^ Market street, and pro
ceeded to clear itself of the "stigma"
clinging to its skirts as a result of the
fusion during the last campaign with Boss
Buckley. â Â£&
The political hatchet was out of its
sheath and whetted to a razor edge in an
ticipation of the execution to come.
The execution came. And now E. S.
Barney, Dr. George W. Day wait, Taylor
Rogers, George D. Gillespie, T. V. Gator,
Joseph Ashbury Johnson, John C. Gore
and other well-known leaders are no
more â that is, as bright lights shedding
their luster over the People's party.
Mr. Barney complained bitterly 1 hat it
was a "slate" and a "deep-laid scheme,"
and the evidence was so conclusively in
favor of Mr.Barney's proposition regard
ing the slate at least that the rest only
smiled and "said never 11 word."
Mr. Johnson expressed his sorrow that
the parties had gone into the hands of
such an element and washed his hands of
thÂ» whole business.
Dr. -Day wait expressed his disgust at
the way things were going some time ago j
and ceased to trouble himself lurther.
Taylor Rogers' and Cator's names were
withdrawn as candidates for the execu
tive committee by the men that nomi
nated them before the balloting began. "
They evidently had been made aware of
what was coming to pass. ,
Prominent in tiie ranks of the winners
was Burnette G. Haskell, the famous j
founder of the Kaweah Colony and the j
manipulator of '-the slate, which was car
ried through with one exception.
The slate as prepared in Haskell's office
was a3 follows:
Chairman, Lewis; vice-chairman, Anthony;
secretary, C. 11. Johnson; iinancial secretary,
Tinginan; trustee*â W.J. Gricr, J> Si. Rey
nold*. W. H. Goff; executive committeeâ Key
nolds. Golf, Hatch, Adam, Haskell, Grier, Liv- 1
iiigco<l, Anthony, Porter, Griswold, Fletcner,
Ray, Dunham, Morton Howard. C. D. Rodgers,
B. J. I've, Peck, H. J. lloey ; librarian, Gris
wold.
The slate was carried through with one
exception. In the trustees, an unimpor
tant position, J. D. Thompson was elected
itis:e:id of J. M. Reynolds. Reynolds and
Griswold tied on the executive committee,
and the tie will be decided at a meeting to
h? he.d next Saturday evening at 915>Â£
Market street. V, â 
In t!>e opinions of most intelligent Pop
nlists this means the disintegration of the
Populists in ihi3 city. Gore was running
for financial secretary. His confidence
that' he would win and tlri9 become an
ex-offi^io member of the executive com
mittee caused him to lose both; positions.

HATCH HAD COUBAGS.
He Called- Bourko Cockran to Time in
I < -;ir <kh Stylo.
A story 13 told mat illustrates the per
sonal courage of the late ex-Congressman
W. H. Hatch. One afternoon the Hou c
Democrats held a caucus on the tariff. It
was about 5 in the afternoon. Hatch en
tered the hall while Bourke Cockrau was
giving bis Democratic colleagues a tre
mendous lecture because they had not
come up to his notions in their tariff atti
tude. No sooner had Cockran taken his
seat than Hatch claimed the floor and be
gan a personal and very pointed attack
on Cockran for presuming to criticise the
House Democracy when ho (Cockran) had
been absent from the sessions hilly nine
teen days out of every twenty. Hatcn
' wrathlully l.urled back Cockraa's criti
! cisms in that statesman's teeth.
"Don't you dare lay your strictures
upon me," said Hatch,. "nor attempt the
airs of a Bowery bully in my case. I will
not stand it for a moment."
Cockran, who had been listening to
Hatch in high dudgeon, sprang from his
safet at this, and started in the most threat
ening fashion down, lie middle aisle of
the House; presumably to eet at Hatch.
The bigu-spii ited .Westerner did not waste
a second. Somewhat to Cockran's dismay
Hatch started for him. At the sight of all
this prompt valor on Hatch's part, Cock
ran came to a lull stop and sat down in
the nearest seat. By this time other states
men had headed off Had). :
" "That's aii ripht," .said Hatch to the
half-dozen members who/were expostulat
ing.with him; "turn the gentleman loose.
I beard him give that Bowery, war yell of
his and start for me, and that is all ihatis
necessary, in my case. I'll allow no gen
tleman to wear out his shoes hunting for
me. ; I'll save him alii can, and will go
as far toward him as he will come toward
m*." . :
.: Hatch was finally , quieted by his col
leagues and walked away to his seat. â

WAS MADDENED
BY ABSINTHE
Frank H. Brockman At
tempted Murder and
Committed Suicide.
His Intended V.ctim Escaped
With a Siight
Wound.
No R asoa for H*s Deeds Ex^piing
the Vicous Effects of the
Tricky Liquor.
Crazed with absinthe and in the reck
lessness of debauch, Frank H. Brockman,
a well-known young man, sent a bullet
crashing through the jaw of Marguerite
Hollis cany yesterday morning, and then
before the alarm could be given, aimed
the revolver at his own head and ended
hi* life.
The motive, if motive there was in the
Frank H. Brockman, Who While Under the Influence of Absinthe,
Attempted to Murder Marguerite Hollis and Then Committed
Suicide*
acts, has not yet been ascertained. From
Brockmun's habits and his demeanor pre
vious to the tragedy, it seems probable
that the idea of murder and suicide was
inspired only by the liquor. The exact
circurrstances of th? afiair may never be
known, as the scene of the shooting was a
bagnio.
Brockman, who was a clerk for Millar &
Simpson, tearchers of records, had been
drinking heavily for some time. Of late
he had become an absinthe drinker, and
his friends say he would swallow a whisky
glass full of absinthe at ore gulp. Ha
realized the hopelessness of his condition
and endeavored many times to reform.
Recently he attempted to enter the navy,
but was rejected on account of a slight
physical defect. On New Year's day he
bade some of his friends good-by, saying
he was KOing to take a trip abroad to over
come his pernicious appetite. He was
under the influence of liquor then. His
fripnds took little notice 01 his words.
Friday eveninir, in company with three
women, he entered the Wr.verly saloon, at
41 McAllister street, of which J. S. Mack
intosh is proprietor. He was, according
to Mackintosh, drunk and quarrelsome,
nnd in order to avoid trouble the saloon
keeper gave him drinks on credit. After
remaining with his companion? for some
time Mackintosh induced him to leave.
Again he returned, at 10 or 11 o'clock,
still apparently looking for â  rouble. There
wera a number of persons of both sexes in
the sitting-room of the saloon and with
some of these, including Marguerite Hol
lis, he had a speaking acquaintance. He
entered into the conversation in a boister
ous'manner, flourishing a revolver and
making threats. Brockman was known
as a "josher" and his talk about what he
couid do with a revolver occasioned no
fear other than that the weapon would co
off accidentally.
About 2 o'clock, according to Mackin
tosh, Brockman left his place, and atter
that nothing is known of his movements
until the tragedy, which occurred a few
minutes al'.er 3 o'clock yesterday morning.
At that tinir- the Holiis woman, who
occupies one of the rooms over the saloon,
came running to the room occupied by
Mackintosh.
"I am shot!" she cried, and the blood
streaming from her face corroborated the
story.
Mackintosh ran to her room and found
Brockman lying on the bed with a wound
in his head, apparently unconscious.
The ambulance was hastily eumnioned
and the pair were taken to the Receiving
Hospital, only about 200 yards distant. An
examination showed that a bullet ha<l Â»11
--tered the right side of Brockman's jaw
raid hnd lodued jn the brain. Ho aied
about 10 o'clock yesierday morning with
out havinp made any siatement.
Tue woman's injury wj'.a not 80 serious.
Her mouth was evidently open when the
shot tnat struck her was fired, ior it first
came in contact with the interior of her
jaw. About the time Brockman died stie
was al.owed to go to her room. Here she
remained until Hftemoon, her companion"
declaring to the Morgue officials that she
had gone away, where they did not know.
In tlie afternoon she was taken 10 the City
anil County Hospital.
Before leaving the Receiving Hospital
she save a brlei statement of the affiir.
She sairt Hollis enteied her room abou;
2:30 o'clock and commenced brandishing
v revolver, saying that he was going to
shoot her. She thought he was joking,
but bepged him to put up his gun. While
she was thus entreating him he fired. As
she ran from the room she heard the sec
ond shot.
BrocUman is not known to have been
imlmuie with the woman whose life he
attempted. He knew her as he knew
many other women of her clase, hut his
friends and Mackintosh deny that Brock
man haJ any t articular care for her.
The deceased was horn in this City and
was 29 years of ape. He commenced life
as a newsboy and was particularly bright
and successful in that line.
About twelve years aeo ha entered the
employ of Millar & Simpson. He was a
clever accountant and wÂ«s very popular.
His drinking hobns were well known to
all his acquaintances. About the City
Hall he was Known as an inveterate j }fcer
and in a â pirit of fun he had been popu
larly duubpd "Judge Ruts."
He l-'ave-a mother and Â«n unmarried
sister, with whom he resided at 3-OAGuer
rero street. He has a brother who is a
postmaster in Oklahoma, to which Terri
tory the remains will be sent for banal.
MET IN COLLISION.
Inquiry Into a Clash Between Two
Sacramento Hi ver Steamer*.
The United States local inspectors of
steam vessels began en inquiry yesterday
into t cause ol the collision of the river
steamers Knight No. 1 and MoJoc, on the
Sacramcn?*Kiver on the morning of De
cember 21. .. The Knight was towing a
barge. Both vessels were considerably
damaged by the shock.
John Toggart, 5 the chief engineer of the
Knight, testified that the weather was
thick and his whistle was being blown fre
quently. He did not see the Modoc until
it was.within twenty feet. After . the i col
lision the Modoc took the other's barge to
Sacramento. The -Knight was, lully
slopped when the two vessels struck eac:i
Other.
Thomas H. Price, the master of the
Knight, testified that ho was whistling
along the river so as to warn all boats of
the approach of the steamer and her tow.
Just before he sighted the Modoc the
barge sheared in the current and nulled
his steamer to port out of the channel.
Just then the Modoc's lights were seen.
He said bÂ« was unable to straighten his
boat in urne. The Modoc struck the
Knight No. 2 on the starboard sMe and
pusiied her onto the bank, where the
crippled steamer settled. A large hole
was cut into her aide, extending below the
water line.
E. S. tfouratt was in charge of the Modoc
at the time. The boat was running on a
slow bell, as the weather was foggy. When
the Knight was sighted she was making
across the Modoc's bow. He ordered the
Modoc to be stopped and Dacked, which
order was lulfiiled, but the current and
momentum were too strong and the two
boats collided.
W. Falkenbnrg, the pilot on the barge
in tow of the Knight, also gave an account
of the collision as viewed from the barge.
The taking of testimony wiil be resumed
soon.
He Was easoned.
Colonel Chaille-Long of the easiern
Â«hore of Maryland, well known as an
American traveler, who has just lectured
before the Geographical Association of
Washington, tells tiie following story:
"One day when 1 was with Gordon as
chief of his staff he a^ked me, in a qu:z
zing aa'-, how it was I lad never died of
the jurule fever.
" "Sir, 1 Isa <l, 'I was born on the east
ern snore of Maryland, and have breathed
the air of malaria and swamp f9ver for
many ytiirs. This was my training-school
lor Easiern travel.' "â Pittsburg Dispatch.
Not What He Meant.
"Young man," said a wealthy city man
to his spendthrift nephew, "I laid the first
foundation of my fortune by saving cab
fares."
"I didn't know yon ever drove one, an
cle," remarked the youth. â Tit-Bits.

DOSE AND NOSE
AT THE FINISH
Gallant and Morte Fonso
Run a Dead Heat
at Ingleside.
Honig's Fast Zimar II Captured
the Handicap in a Com
mon Canter.
An Easy Win for Sa'vab'eâ Governor
Budd First in the Kunile Event
Ru nart's Numb r Hoisted.
In comparison with toe immense
crowd present at the races on New Year's
day the attendance at Ingleside yesterday
looked small, though tue usual Saturday
racegoing set w^-re all present. Eighteen
pencilers doing business in the ring found
no lack of coin. The track was again a
trifle deep and heavy, which precluded
the idea of any fast time being registered.
The track continues adding to its
phenomenal long list of winning favorites.
Of the six events run off the favored ones
in the betting showed the advantage in
four. Willie Martin piloted two of the
winners.
For the first time in many years two
horses finished so closely together that
the judges were unable to separate them,
and declared a dead heat. Tom Griffin's
Morte F onse and A. B. Spreckels' Gallant
were the ones so closely matched. They
were starters in the last race of the day, a
mile arid a sixteenth selling affair, lor
which Thornhill at 13 to 5 ruled a slight
favorite in tbe betting. Doctor G and
Thornhiil showed the way into the
stretch, where the Doctor fell back and
Gallant and Morte Fon^e closed on the
bald-faced leader. In a gruelling drive
Thornhill in the middle was beaten half a
length, witn the other two finishing nosea
on ihe wire. Their owners agreed to split
the purse, which decision appeared satis
factory to all.
Ruihart, with "bad actor" opposite his
name on the programme, was an even
money favorite for the opening mile run,
and taking the lead from Flashlight in
the stretch won easily from that horse by
three lengths. Fifteen to one was laid
against Flashlight.
"From his penormanco in the seven-fur
long fpin lor three-year-olds, Caspar is far
from being a top-notcher. Held at odds
of 11 to 20 in the ring, he was easily out
footed the last quarter of the journey by
Good Times and downed ha.f a lengtti.
H. Martin on Estaea came through next
tbe rail on entering the stretch, and this
undoubtedly cost that colt the place, as
the going was very heavy. M. Clicquot
showed speed at the beginnine. The
winner was 4*4 to 1 in the betting.
The handicap over seven furlongs went
to tbe 3to 2 choice, Zimar 11. Carrying
101 pounds Houig's geluing Jed from the
outset, winning very easily in 1:163^- Pat
Murphy with 87 pounds up secured the
place by a head lrom Peril. Sir Play was
slow to set away from the barrier.
The mile and a half run for the jumpers
over six obstacles was a tame affair. Gov
ernor Budd. witli Hennessv up and an
even- money favorite, won with ease from
Bedford, ridden by Clancy. Haymarket,
the second choice, with Spence in the
saddle, stumbled at the third jump, un
seating his rider, after which he continued
running with the bunch.
Pat Dunne's Salvable strikes many a
soitspot. A3 to 5 favorite for the six
lurlong sprint that was fiftn on the card,
the second choice Alvarado was unfor
tunate in almost being left at the post and
the iavorite galloped in iialf a length in
auvance of Olive, with Shield Bearer a
close third.
Notes.
While galloping on the track yesterday
morning, Tom Griffin's black gelding
Gordon, a son of Tremont, in Borne man
ner managed to shy and break a shoulder
and was destroyed.
Over at Oakland track old Faro man
aged to collide with a yearling and was
thrown heavily to the track. The fall
must have broken his neck, for he never
moved after the accident. He was owned
by A. G. Stephenson.
The following horses, the property of
McEvoy <fc Dale of Denver, were sold by
Killip & Co. at the track yesterday: Cap
tain Rees. *310, W- Fisher; Frank Dale,
$35 J. J. Marion; Mary B, $SO, N. S. hall;
McLight, $000, John Coleniau; Silver Foot,
$150. J). J. Lynch .
M. Clicquot showed considerable speed
dorinx the early part of tue running In
the opening race. He has yet to show
though that he is worth $2100.
Alter betting on the hurdle event had
progiessed for some time, it was stopped
by the judges and Stanford waa replaced
by Spence to pilot Haymarket. After the
race Stanford 3tated that the horse's "
owner, D. M. Boyd, made overtures to
him to lay the horse up, but that he re
fused, at'the same time telling I'-oyd to
get another rider. Tiio officials in the
stand will investigate 'he mniter.
PBOTECTION POfb -HOMERS.
Measure to Be Submitted at Sacramento
by the Citliforn.a Homing Club.
The California Homing Club last evening
adopted a draft of a bill to protect homing
pigeons from hunters and the cluowiil
work hard to have it enacted into a law at
Sacramento. Tue draft, which was pre
pared oy A. Carlisle, was as follows:
Section L That it shall bo unlawful for any
person or persons to shoot, main or kill any
Antwerp, messenger or homing pigeon eitlu-r
in flight or at rest; Â»nd any pt-rson frailty of
shouting, killing or maiming such pigeon or
pigeons as aforesaid, shal l be guilty ot amis
demeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall,
for every such offense, nay a fine of not less than
$10 nor more than $25.
Sec. 2. That on a ;d after the passage of this
act it shall be unlawful for any person or per
sons to forcibly detain or entrap any Ant
werp, messenger or homing pigeon which can
be identified by any device or mark; ami any
person or persons so detaining said pigeon or
pigeons shall be jruilty of a misdemeunor, and
upon conviction thereof snail, for every such
offeuse, pay a line of not less than $10 nor
more than $25.
AMERICAN PLAN OBSOLETE
The Big Eastern Hotels Have
Nearly All Discontinued It
for the Grill.
Why tbe Changes Wer? Made at the
Baldwinâ About $50,000 Spent
in a Year.
The changes in the Baldwin Hotel
aroused interest about the City yesterday.
The opening ot the grillroom recently
and the closing of the American rtining
room has already been alluded to. Messrs.
Stone and Asher of t c hotel said last
night, however, that there was a misap- '
prehension in regard to the reason for the
changes.
"Since a year ago last October, when we .
took hold of the hotel," said one of the
gentlemen, "there has been $50,000 spent
on it, and $35,000 of this has been during
the last three months, on tbe grillroom
and in other ways. We closed the Ameri
can Dlan because it is no longer modern.
"The big hotels in the East have dis
continued the American plan and have
found that tbe grill and restaurant suit
their patrons far better. We can now not
only accommodate all the snests without
the American plan, but can serve any
number from the outside. We have also
retained all our upstairs empLoyes, as we
needed them below for the guests that
now ko to the grillroom and restaurant.
"Mr. Glaze, who has succeeded Mr.
dough, receives exactly the same pay for
his servicf-s as he did. We are not econo
mizing there, nor anywhere. In fact, if
we can just go alon? and make as much
money propor ionateiy for the year as we
have during the last two days, we will
have plenty of money.
"I went East some time ago," said Mr.
Btone, "and spsnt a good while examining
the various biÂ« hotels and seeing the pro
prietors. They all told me that 1 should
close up the American plan, that they had"
all done so and found it worked admi
rably. I have found out the same- thine,
too, already, but we are very Â£lad we made
tbe change. It has paid. By tbe way,
Mr. Cloueh was at no time manager, but
head clem. That is the position Mr. Glaze
has."

'>. . .bay will be present to-morrow afternoon.
' ..â¢ "â¢.â¢/â¢Just: twerve years ago," said Miss
. Bown to-day, "I became an officer in the
Salvation irmj and was appointee to a
â¢" â¢ station at Boston. The army in
' â Â«Â» those-. days was not what it is to-day. The
' -'Jargest "churches in prominent cities were

â  â¢â -. .alone one Saturday evening to open up
c " ' ..-vt he work. It was a hard job, bat Sunday
'Wjas^arder. I talked and sang and prayed,
Â°.~" but it seemed to be just a waste of
." Strength, Only a few pnople listened to
' â -â ;. toe and even they made fun of me and did
their utmost to..discourage me. I worked

V â  /â¢Sorry, to-let me go and an enormous crowd
"â¢'. â¢ '* gathered at my last meeting-.

It was at Taunton that Captain Bowa
attained great notoriety a few years ago
by being imprisoned for an -alleged viola
, tion of a blue law. She refused to pay a
â¢ ', â¢ fine" of $1 and. appealed the case to a
â¢'. higher court, which rendered a â¢ verdict in
. â â - her favor. . It was while in charge of a
â¢ : lar.ee training garrison for women officers
â¢ 'â¢ in Brooklyn that Miss Bown was selected
* as the* leader of an attacK on the slums.'
With a little lieutenant she opened up
quarters in a- lodging-house- on Cherry

â¢ .. '."I am thoroughly in iove with my work

;.*'-An EjscapeJ S.mian Pet of a Greek
; :."' Letter Society Was Supposed Â»
.*** ;V; to Be a Burglar.
â¢â¢' BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 2.â Residents
in Che neighborhood of Shattuck and Uni
versity, "avenues were roused from their
slurnbe'r- early this morning and caused
I . td arm themselves against' what they took
. to-be -a .burglar seeking to gain entrance
r .into, their homes. Peculiar noises were
heard tin the roofs of the houses at various
( intervals, low moans were now and then
. emitted, and an occasional pattering on
â¢â¢ .the window panes added to their fears. : : :
â¢ At some time during the night there
was hardly a family on the block which
. was not roused by the strange noise. One
lady says she was up all night with a gun'
*
in her hand waiting for the supposed
burglar to show his head. When morn
ing came and the neighbors began to ex
change their daily ereetiugs, the "burg
lar" question was discussed. Each had
the same story to tell. Investigation dis
closed the iact that all the excitement and
wakeiuiness was due to the nocturnal me-,
anderings of a small pet monkey belong-'
ing to one of the Greek letter fraternities,
which had broken his chain and escaped
from his covert.
When the truth became Known tnere
Was an exchange of laughs between the
sleepless neighbors and a swearing of
vengeance against the animal that
had spoiled their hrst night's rest of the
new year.
Still Going On.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan.2.â The contro
versy between Rev. Edward B. .Payne of the
Unitarian Society and Rev. J. Clarke Rob
bins, pastor of the North Berkeley Con
gregational Church, over the larewell ser
mon which V c former preached last Sun
day and its effect on the audience, is still
going on, but is gradually subsiding. In a
lengthy, open letter, published to-day in
a local paper Rev. Mr. Robbins attempts
to prove that Rev. Dr. Payne in his ser
mon did not score orthodoxy, that there
was a minor chord running all through
the sermon, and that the" address was
pregnant witn its warning to all young
men.
In closing his letter, Mr. Robbins takes
the opportunity of paying a high tribute
to his opponent in the discussion. But in
the last few words fie intimates that the
life of Dr. Payne has not turned out to be
wnat his youthful aspirations doubtless
pointed toward.
Bnrkeley Flower Show.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 2.â The mem-

of obtaining more.
A few weeks ago Nellie, the only child
of the deceased doctor by his widow, died,
and ajs the will of her father had not been
probated at that time, the portion of his
estate deeded to Miss Neil'ie under the
terms of the will, reverted to Dr. George
C. Pardee, her half- bro '.her.
The chief ground oi contest sets forth
that at the time ot the making of his will
Dr. E. H. Pardee was debilitated in niind
and body to such an extent as to render
him incompetent to make a will. On ac
count ol the nature oi his many ailments
it is alleged that it became necessary to
give him large quantities of morphine,
chloral and other drugs, and that at, the
time he made his will he was suffering
from their effect.
The next ground contains the following
strong language: "The last will of said
decedent is not the last or any will of the
decedent, for the reason tiiat at the time
said will and codicii are alleged to have
been executed sa^d E. H. Pardee was not
free from fraud, but that said will and
codicii were pro. ured to be made turousih
the fraud of George C. Pardee."
The unpleasant family relations that
were known to exist are gone into at
length. In this portion of her contest
Mrs. Pardee says:
After the aeath of his nrother, in the year
1877, said George C. Pardee took a violent, ud
reasunable and unwarranted dislike to this
contestant, because she had accepted an offer
of marriage made to her in thai year by nis
father, and this dislike ripened into bitter
hatred of Her wlien, in 1879, she became the
wiie of his lather, and it tia.-i continued from
that time until the present. â¢
For two years alter he (George G. Pardee)
learned of the engagement between contest
ant and his fatncr.he strenuously objected to
and vigorously opposed the marriage of his
father. He pleaded with his father not to
marry, and threatened to bring disgrace upon
himself if his wishes were not in this regard
complied with.
For about two years he succeeded in hisefforts,
his father postponing the date of marriage
from time to time, in the hope that his sou's ob-
jections might be withdrawn. In the* mean
time this contestant was greatly worried over
the situation, aud being greatly devoted to
said E. H. Pardee, suffered great mental an
guish on account of said opposition of George
C. Pardee, which resulted in brain fever and a
loug and serious illness. Thereupon said E.
11. l'ardee determined no longer to listen to
the objections of his said son, and tbe mar
riage between him and the contestant was
duiy-solmenized.
Upon George C. Pardee's first appearance
after said marriage at the home tif ins father
and this contestant, and while the latter were
with some friends partaking of dinner, this
contestant arose and extended her hand to
him, but the courtesy was ignored with con
temptuous demeanor, and he* enjoyed, as he
since often has enjoyed, the, hospitality of said
home without any friendly salutations or rec
ognition of this contestant, but with maul
ftstations of contempt and hatred.
And in like manner said George C. Pardee
treated his sister Nellie from her infancy to
the time of her death. Upon tne return of
said George C. Pardee from Europe, where he
had been tor some time attending certain in
stitutions of learning, he resided for about two
years in the home of his father and U)is con
testant.
At that time said Nellie was a little child,
but said George C. Pardee never â  bestowed
upon her a word or performed an act of affec
tion, to the knowledge of this contestant. His
indifference toward the child, especially at
times when she was sick, greatly distressed
his father and called from him rebukes.
Owing to this unbrotherly and unkind treat
ment said Nellie formed great antipathy
against said George C. Pardee, which was in
tensitied just before and at the time said pre
tended will was executed, on account of the
conduct of said George C. Pardee hereinafter
referred to, of all of which she was fully cog
nizant, and this feeling on her part was at all
times to him well known.
This contestant -and her husband, E. H.
Pardee, lived happily together from the tine
of their marriage down to the month o: Ju v,
1895, with the exception of a brief 'neriou in
the year 1883, they each having a great affec
tion lor the other.
On the 3d day of June, 1895, said E. H.
Pardee stated that he had loaned his son
George $7000, of which amount there had
been repaid to aim about $2500. In the event
of his death, said son would be released from
the payment of the balance due, and as he
bad never given this contestant any funds ex
cept for payment of expenses he desired to bt
stow upon her $3000 or her use in case of his
death. Said E. H. Pardee thoreupon drew his
check for $3000 and presented the same to
this contestant.
On July 3, 1895, said E. H. Pardee and this
contestant went to a health retreat in the
county of Napa for the benefit of the health of
said E. H. Pardee. They remained at this re
treat from July 3 to July 21. During this
period said E. H. Pardee received, as contestant
is Informed and believes, an anonymous letter
in which he was advised to look out for a "big
black Jew," or a "flat-footed Jew," who was
paying undue attention to his wife. His
manner and treatment ot tnis contestant at
once chanced, and he became and thereafter
remained insanely jealous and suspicions of
this contestant.
wink- contestant and her husband were at
said retreat in Napa County ?-aid George C.
Pardee visited them, and after one of said
visits said E. H. Pardee astonished this con
testant with charging her with having im
proper relations with a "big black Jew" ; and
upon her information and belief contestant
alleges that said George C. Pardee, taking ad
vantage of the enfeebled condition of said E.
H. Pardee, and with intent to alienate his af
fection for this contestant and to secure to
himself a large Interest in the estate of his
iather by testamentary disposition, did falsely
and fraudulently pretend and represent to
said K. H. ParJee that there was reason to be
lieve the statements in said anonymous letter
regarding a "big black Jew" were true.
In truth and in fact said statement in said
letter was utterly without foundation, and
the intimation therein contained and the
representation made to said E. H. Pardee
upon that subject were utterly, wickedly and
maliciously false and defamatory. Neverthe
less, contestant Hllegc upon her information
and belief that saia E. H. Pardee was by said
falsa and fraudulent representations induced
to believe that this contestant was an un
worthy woman and wife; that she had been
unfaithful to her marriage vows and mtiritAl
ooligations, and that this belief operated
upon the mind of said E. H. Pardee in the
making of said pretented will, and caused him
to attempt to bestow thereby upon contestant
less ot his bounty and estate than he other
wise would have bestowed upon her, and to
attempt to make a will other and different
than he otherwise wou^d have made.
In conclusion, Mrs. Pardee denies that
she ever acted improperly, or that she was
ever other than a -good wife. She states
that at the instance of Dr. G. C. Pardee
detectives were empioved to watch her.
She also asserts that her husband, prior
to his death, told her that ac had leit to

SILVER MINING
NOW PAYS WELL
E. E. Bassett of Colorado on
the Greatly Improved
Methods.
The Present Price for Bullion as
Profitable as the Flush
Prices.
The Powder, Railway Freight and
Treatment Have, Ha Says,
Fallen One-Half.
E. E. Bassett, lessee of the Silver Bell
mme -at Ophir. in San Miguel County,
Southwestern Colorado, is among the ar
rivals at the Grand.
â¢ . JSe is on his way to the new Randsburg
gold district to see what developments
haVe been made there, and if he is pleased
and can s;et property to suit him he will
become interested there.
Mr. iJassett nas been in the district be
fore; In 1883 and again in 1885 he spent a
good deal of time on the Mojave Desert in
.the vicinity of these mines and also in
Sierra and Siskiyou counties.
"I am going down to Randsburg now,"
said he, "to see what has been done since
I left. Gold mining is really the nicest of
all mining, and California probably the
best of all countries in which to mine.
â  The climate is so fine and there are so
"many other advantages that I know of no
other country equal to it.
"In my judgment, however, Colorado
will this year snrpass California in its out
put of cold. But that will not be because
our mines are better, but because, as we
â¢ think, we put forth a good deal more
energy than you do here. I believe that
if the experienced miners of Colorado
â were moved in here the output would bs
doubled.
"We have got silver mining down a
great deal finer in Colorado than it was a
dozen years ago, or pven than it was five
or six years ago. We used to think we
c.ouldn't handle ore unless it ran away up,
but now our methods of mining are better
and our mcde of treatment infinitely
cheaper.
"Old dumps have been and are yet being
worked over, and we Uon't throwore now
over with the debris. We conduct our
â¢mines cnrefully and make money, and 60
to 65 cents for silver is as good now as 85
and 90 cents formerly. Whiie labor is only
about 15 per cent cheaper, powder, railway
freight and treatment have fallen one-half.
"It is mucli the same in gold-mining.
' Formerly we wouldn't look at anything
that wouldn't go $20 to $30 a ton; we
r wouldn't even consider it. But now $6 or
$7 is pretty good, and we manage to make
.juoney."
Mr. Bassett will probably be in the City
a week or two before leaving for Rauds
â¢ burg.
SCHNEIDER'S PET BEAR.
It Broke Away From the Trocadero and
3len Are Scouriug the Locality
to Capture It.
M. Schneider, a saloon-keeper near the
Ingleside racetrack, is the owner of a
brown pet bear, which is now about a year
old. It amused Schneider's customers by
.eating potatoes corn beef, bread and other
articles of lood, and enjoyed most of all a
.... drink of beer.
Ernest Dolter, who keeDS the saloon at
" the Trocadero, happened to be in Schnei
â  der's saloon on Christmas day and he was
so tickled with the pet bear's antics that
he , invited Schneider to pay him a visit as
- soon as possible and bring the bear along
. -with him snd any of his friends who cared
to accompany him.
Yesterday afternoon Schneider and a
few friends went to the Trocadero with
* the bear. They tied it to a tree and went
into the saloon to have a drink prepara
tory to. getting the bear to amuse them
Â. with his tricks.
Tjiey stopped in the saloon about half
â¢ an hour, Dolter playing the part of host in
. a generous manner, and then they all
stepped outside to have some fun wita the
bear, but no bear could be seen. It had
succeeded in getting the baiter off its neck
and trotted away to have a good time all
. by itself.
Now Schneider and his friends are scour
ing the nills and valleys in the neighbor-
Dooa to recapture the bear, but up to a
late hour last night no trace of it could be
found. Schneider says it will not harm
any one, but if a. nervous person should
come face to face with it the consequences
might be seiious.

Busy and overworked physicians often
treat these things as separate ailments,
â¢when the whole trouble has the one
source. The reproductive organs are so
important a part of the body that when
they are out of order, the whole system
is deranged. _ Whatever illness a ' wo-
man has, she will do well to look there
for the cause.
A great many women knowingly neg-
lect themselves! because they dread the
telling of their troubles to a physician
and the subsequent examination and
local treatment." All this is needless

VALENCIA -STREET CLUB.
A Determined Kft'ort la to Be Made
to I>ight That Thorough
fare.
The temporary setback given the busi
ness men and residents on Valencia street
by the refusal of the Supervisors to have
electric-lights substituted for the gas
lamps at the public expense has not in
the least dampened the enthusiasm of the
residents of the warm belt.
A reorganization of the Mission Defense
Club, that did so mucti in the past for this
section in making a boulevard of Folsom
street, the locating of a high school just
in the locality where the people sought to
have it, and the quieting of the claims of
the Noe heirs to possess themselves of the
homes of thousands of honest and inno
cent settlers have bo.m such productive
fruits that the same material will resolve
itself into a Valencia improvement club,
with the fixed and steady determination
to stay with the cause of making that
streetan attractive as well as a commercial
one before many months of the year 1897
pass.
Such stayers as Judge F. W. Van Rey
nepom, A. P. Van Duzer. Daniel Webster
Kelly, A. B. Maguire, John 11. Grady and
Mayor-elect Phelan will not retire once
they get started until they accomplish
what they go for.
Tnose, with others, are about to organ
ize an improvement club, with the inten
tion of not only having Valencia street
lighted by arc lights, but also of having
that street pavea with bitumen from Mar
ket to Twenty-ninth, thus giving to the
public an avenue with an outlet â and the
only one â leading into San Mateo and
Santa Clara counties.
This is the intention of the club about
to be organized, just as soon as the requi
site number of substantial names can be
obtained to the enrollment of the club
membership.

CLUBS PROTEST.
Denounce the Proceeding's of
Supervisor Wagner as Being
Revolutionary.
There was a good attendance at tbe
special meeting held last night at l3'nai
B'rith Hall of the members of tbe Asso
ciation of Improvement Clubs, called lor
the purpose cf denouncing the members
of the old Board of Supervisors who
sought to retain their positions.
After President George R. Fletcher had
called the meeting 10 order and Leon
Samuels, the secretary pro tern., had
read the call explaining its object Dr. C.
D. Salfield offered a series of resolutions,
as follows:
Resolved, That the San Francisco Association
of Improvement Clubs, in special meeting as
sembled, do hereby protest against the pro
ceedings taken by the incumbent of the office
of Supervisor of the Twelnh Ward of this City
and County, which proceedings, in our opin
ion, are revolutionary in character, and
should not even be entertained, let alone sus
tained, by any court; further
Jteso red, That we hereby remonstrate
against, discountenance and condemn these
proceedings and respectfully request the judi
ciary brancn of the governmeui not to delay
its decision in this ease.no matter what it
may be, so that this community will know at
the very earliest date wnether the last elec
tion held in this City and County was a larce
or a solemn unalterable decree of the voice of
the people.
He reviewed the recent legal develop
ments in connection with the attempt of
the present board to hold over, and added
that while Jud^e Hebbard's decision yes
terday virtually settled the matter he yet
desired to have the resolution acted upon,
as there was no telling, he said, what new
scheme might be sprung on Monday. He
declared tiiat he thought the Spring
Valley Water Company was back of the
movement to keep the old board in office,
as it desired some further favors at its
hands.
After considerable discussion the reso
lutions were adopted.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 3, 1897.
MR. WATSON WEDS
MISS SPRECKELS
The Ceremony Occurred
Last Wednesday at
San Jose.
Kept a Secret Till the Happy
Couple Arrived Here
Last Evening.
The Bride the Only Daughter of Cain
Spreckels and the Groom a
Prominent Broker.
The best circles of San Francisco society
will be greatly interested in a romantic
wedding which took place quietly last
Wednesday afternoon at San Jose. The
wedding, which was wholly unheralded,
will come as a surprise to the friends of
both the prominent contracting parties.
About 5 o'clock that alternoon Miss
Emma Spreckels became the wife of
Thomas Watson.
Miss Spreckels is the only daughter of
Claus Spreckels of this City, one 01 the
wealthiest men of the Pacific Coast. Mr.
Watson is a well-known grainbroker.
On the 2:30 o'clock train wnich.left
Third and Townsend streets last Wednes
day afternoon Mr. Watson and Miss
I Spreckels, accompanied by a few inti
mate friends, left for San Jose. Arriving
there about 4:30 o'clock the party was at
once driven to Trinity Episcopal Church.
The necessary legal preliminaries had
been arranged, and at the church a friend
with the license, and the rector, the Rev.
Dr. Waketield, were in waiting. There was
no attempt at considerable decoration.
The prominent contracting parties desired
to be very quietly married, and the cere
mony was quietly but impressively per
formed without ostentatious accompani
ments. The elaborate Episcopal service
was gone through with, and tbe few
friends extended the heartiest congratula
tions to the bride and groom.
Mr. and Mrs. Watson drove at once to
the Hotel Yendome, where they remained
till yesterday afternoon, receiving only a
few friends. Precautions were taken to
see that the wedding was kept out of the
newspapers of San Francisco and Sun Jose
until they were ready to surprise their
friends and let the public know.
Yesterday afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Wat
son leit San Jose and arrived in this City
early last evening. Mr. Watson sent a
wire to personal friends and Mrs. Watson
also telegraphed to several of hers. A
small party awaited them at the station
I and offered their heartiest congraulations,
I which were as happily received. Mr. and
Mrs Watson at once repaired to a suite of
apartments in a leading hotel.
The plans of the newly married couple
were not announced even to their most in
timate friends. One of the club associates
of Mr. Watson predicted that they would
take an early trip to England and the Con
tinent.
It is said by clubmen that Mr. Watson
has been valiantly laying siepe to Miss
Spreckels' heart and charms for more than
two years. Tne quiet wedding consum
mated at San Jose last Wednesday, when
the red sun was sinking and the shadows
lengthening over Santa Clara Valley, tells
with what success. Large numbers of
friends are ready to extend congratulations
and a life-long bon voyage.
FROM SAN JOS?.
The Marriage Was Quietly Per
formed by the Rev. Dr.
Wa kef I eld.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 2.â Miss E.
Spreckels and Thomas Watson arrived in
this city last Wednesday, and were mar
ried as soon after their arrival as it was
possible to secure the marriage license and
have the ceremony performed.
The affair was very quiet. Dr. Wake
field, the rector of Trinity Church in this
city, who officiated at the ceremony.which
took place at the rectory adjoining the
church, stated last evening that he was
not at liberty to say anything about toe
mntter, as it was evidently the wish
of the narties that the wedding should not
be made public immediately.
After the marriage the couple went to
the Hotel Vendome, where they regis
tered as Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Watson.
They remained at the hotel till this after
noon, when they took the 2:55 train for
San Francisco. During their stay at the
hotel the couple took strolls around the
grounds and the city and seemed to enjoy
their quiet honeymoon.
Mr. "Watson came alone to secure the
marriage license.
LEVIN BROS.' TAILURE.
Resolutions Adopted at a Meeting: of
Ketail Grocers Last Evening.
A meeting; of retail grocers was held last
evening at the rooms of the Retail Gro
cers' Association, 115 Clay street. Joseph
A. Stulz presided. Resolution* were
adopted in reference to the failure of
Levin Bros, as follows:
Whereas, The recent failure of Levin Bros,
was brought about by the du-a*trous cutting of
prices oi goods sold to them on credit by cer
tain wholesale grocers ana jobbers of S.in
Francisco; and whereas-, the cutting of prices
whicn ruined Levi:i Dros. has nleo affected the
prosperity of every other retail grocer in San
Francisco; and whereas, to allow the firm of
Levin Bros, to make a settlement of less than
100 cents on the dollar would be putting a
premium on the pernicious practice of sell
ing goods bousht on credit and sold below
cost. . Then be it
Resolved, That the retail grocers of San Fran
cisco do protest against any such settlement
lor less than 100 cents on the dollar ueing
made as detrimental to the test interest of
the entire trade. And be it ftmher
Resolved, That we will lend our every In
fluence to prevent the consummation of such
a settlement. Beit
Resolved, That a copy of above resolutions be
sent to ihe Board of Trade and each of the
creditors of the firm of Levin Bros.

being the first of a series of Saturday night
special sales. .Long before 7 o'clock, the
hour announced for the commencement
of tne sale, several thousand people had
congregated in front of the big store, and
so great was the rush when the doors were

ARMAND CAILLEAU,
PROPERTY-OWNERS
TO TAKE THE LEAD
Third Sfrset to Be Illumi
nated From Market to
Townsend.
The Initiatory Steps Assumed
by Public-Spirited Citi
zens.
i
j A New Era of General Improvements
to Be Pushed A ong the
Line.
The business people on Third street,
from Market to Townsend, are not going
to be treated with any ephemeral display.
Tli.: illumination by arc lights is going'
to be continuous, and that, too, from Mar
ket street to the water front.
This improved condition of beautifying
the street and bringing it into touch with
the other Dusiness streets so recently sub
ject to the white electric current eman
ated from the minds of a few. Among
them were: B. Katchinski of the Phila
delphia shoehouse, near Market; J. Sh
verman, dry-goods store, south of How
ard, and some others who discussed the
central location of Third street. They
also considered its prominence as leading
to the San Jose railroad depot, which will
in the near future be tue"grand point at
which Los Angeles travelers and ail from
the sea-coast towns, as also Eastern pas
sengers, will arrive.
The consideration of having The Call's
new building as an object of universal at
traction and adiuiraiiou as a tower of
prosperity and enterprise, at its northern
end leading into Market and Xearny
streets, also had Us weight.
To light up Third street and otherwise
improve its appearance the business men
came to the conclusion that the property
owners were the proper parties to set
about the improvements and make them
on a permanent bayis, as they wouid above
all others be the real ones benelited.
With tnis object in view the two gentle
men named consulted with the following
property-owners and found them to a man
not only willing but anxious to take hold
of the movement: Claus Bpreckels, David
Keil, ltienzi Hughes, Agnes Bowie,
Henry Matthews, .Dan McMiiiian, James
Phelan, Ci. W.WicKer=ham, Sylvain Levy,
\V. B. Oluff.W. HendricKson, G. Harshail,
J. C. Meusdorffer and many others, all of
whom "caught on," so to speak, to th.
prospect of making Third street one of the
best business streets ou the sunny side ol'
Market.
This street has been but lately bitumin
ized, and is, therefore, in first-class con
dition. Tiiis modern improvement has
been brought about by the exertions of
The Call, whicb> urted the necessity of
sucii improvement about twtlve months
ago, and then, as now, the property
owners came to the fronc and made the
beneticial change, since which time busi
ness has improved, and as a consequence
the storekeepers are all the better aule to
meet their landlords on the hrst of each
month. As a consequence the propeny
owners see the necessity oi keeping up the
dignity and commercial standing oi the
thoroughfare.
From present expectations Third street
wiil have its central row of eJectric arc
lights swung out inside of two weeks, ana
all this transformation without even the
formality of a "Third-street improvement
club." But in lieu thereof there will be a
"Third-street set of public-spirited prop
erty-owners." who have seen that a benefit
to the tenants is a benefit to the property
owners.
ROBBED OF HIS MONEY.
Edward Hill Victimized by Two Noto
rious Female Pickpockets.
Edward Hill, a recent arrival from the
East, swore to a complaint yesterday
charging Annie Jfickett and MarnieÃon
ner, two notorious pickpockets, with grand
larceny.
Kill came here with his wife for the
benefit of her health, and is living at 927
Geary street. On the afternoon of Decem
ber 7 he says he met the two women on
Market street, and was induced by tnem
to visit a saloon on O'Farrell street, where
they robbe 1 him of $410.
lie reported the matter to police head
quarters ana was advised to swear to war
rants for their arrest. He declined to do
so, as he did not wish to have his name
mentioned for bis wife's sake, and laid the
case before a local detective agency. The
women were threatened with arrest and
promised to refund the money on iriday.
Thej failed to do so, hence the warrants.
Thewarrants have not been handed to the
police, and it is presumed the private de
tectives are using them 10 force the
women to refund tha money.
Burglarized Consul Coney's House.
James Lane, alias "Buck" Lynch, alias
James Hughes, an ex-convict, was yesterday
held by Judge Campbell to answer before
the Superior Court in $3000 bonds on the
charge of burglary. Lane and another burglar
broko into the residence of Alexander K.
Coney, Mexican Consul, 1522 Post s'reet,
Wednesday night, and Lane was chased and
captured by Special Officer Heinman.

Â«-A FORGOTTEN ANNIVERSARY
TRANSLATING THE HISTORY OF THE CHINESE EMPIRE
/\ Sar\ Franciscan s Herculean Undertaking That Will JRank as One of the Famous Works
of the JMost Enlightened Genhirvj of the World
. CT^HIRTEEN years ago Rev. John
'Vl Gardner of this City conceived the
3*Â£s large design of writing an English
'._ transcription of the enormous bulk of the
mperial or otiicial history of the Chinese
people. He was not then a clergyman,
and not mncli more than a boy. Since
theji, without relaxation of the energy
which prom pted him to undertake tnis
herculean task, he has assiduously
.. labored andâ he is about half through
with his tank.
This is the first account published of
what will at first elancc appear to be an
astonishing enterprise for any one person
to make his own. When the collateral
enterprises are considered which Mr.
Gardner has accomplished by the way,
these growing out of the pursuit of his
original design, public wonderment is
certain, for the official history of 'China
dates back to a period between 3000 and
4000 years before the birth of Christ. It
has been continued onward to the present
time. So Mr. Gardner has essayed to re
produce chronicles written in the Chinese
language in their entirety, covering a
period of approximately GOOO years in
detail.
Involuntarily, as a sort of parallel, the
prodigious industry of Buckle, the Kn^
li?h Historian, who essayed to give toman
â  kind a history of civilization, arises. It is
true that the researches of Bucfele were as
diverse as they were extensive. He studied
and mastered many languages and so
found his facts in the words of those by
'. whom they had originally been recorded.
." He delved into obscure passages and
brought Jucidity out of obscurity. The
ecdpe of his undertaking will probably
remain unique and unparalleled, strictly
- speaking. But there is no doubt that Mr.
Gardner's exploit will also be famous for
many years wherever there are philolo
â¢ gists and scholars. It is possible that his
. labors will be more arduous than were
Buckle's.
The imperial history of China has never
been translated. Historians and political
economists ol all nations, considering the
marvel of the continuance of China as an
entity century after century during the
time when Rome and Greece and other
nations ripened and decayed, have never
had more than a very small part of the
history of that great portion of the world
in their rosse?pion. The great official
work consists of thirty volumes, the
whole aggregating at least 10,000 pages,
closely strewn wilh Chinese characters!
from 460 to 500 to the page. At the out
set, therefore, Mr. Gardner fa.ced the cer
tainty that he would have at least 1,000,000
characters to translate. As three Chinese
characters need, on the average, five words
to give them expression in the English

Mr. Gardner is doing the work practi
cally unaided. Like all men who under
take such exploits, or neariy all, he is
poor, depending sometimes on a small
salary as an interpreter and anon on his
salary as a Chinese missionary for his
subsistence and that of his family. Before
he can complete the history, if he makes
no more rapid progress than he has been
enabled to record up to the present time
at least ten years more will pass. That
is, he will have toiled nearly or fully a
quarter of a century to place in the hands
of succeeding historians every fact known
to the Chinese about themselves, and also
the gigantic myths with which a highly
imaginative nation peopled their world
and accounted for the existence of the
earth and the remainder of the universe.
The collateral enterprises alluded to in
the foregoing may be briefly described.
"1 first read the entire history through,"
said Mr. Gardner yesterday. "That took
about two years, occupying all the time
that I could devote to it. Having done
this I begun the work of translation.
There are shades of thought expressed by
the Chinese language which are practi
cally impossible to render into English
except by the use of paraphrases. The
necessary study over the rendering of
passages with subtle meaning necessarily
has made my progress slow.
"Incidentally, I may say, I have made a
comparison of word-forms, studying the
evolution of the Chinese language, consid
ering its structure and then selecting all
distinctive characters from existing can
onical works, as well as from the transla
tions of the Scriptures into Chinese. All
of these character I have spelled out in
English, according to the exact pronun
ciation of them in Chinese. There are
11,071 characters that I have romanized or
spelled out in English and I have num
bered and explained every one of them.
They are put into English according to
Cantonese. So lar as I know thi< list of
Chinese spelled out in English on the
basi* of the Cantonese is the only one in
the weld.
"If there is another list of that sort I
would like to find it for the sake of com
parisons. Dr. Eitel's Cantonese diction
ary falls short of my list by 1000 to 2000
characters. The explanation of '.his part
of the work is that my stepfather, Key.
Daniel Vrooman, who was Consul of the
United States at Canton, with two or
three learned Chinese literary men assist
ing him, projected a massive Chinese dic
tionary of thirty-five volumes. He had
all the phrases collected which needed to
be translated into Cantonese. He left the
work for me to complete.
"I have prepared a chait of Chinese
characters, which have been spelled out
by me in Eneiish according to the root
characters. On one chart the 11,071 char

Rev. Mr. Gardner Deemed to think that
there was very little to be surprised at in
these amazing incidental labors. He
spoke very simp'y and modestly of the
whole work. Enough curiosity niu^t
have been excited concerning a unique
personality by this time to make some
description in order. In the first place it
may be said that Mr. Gardner's mother
is a full-blooded Chinese woman. She
has been encaged many years in the labor
of christianizing Chinese. His father was
an American.
Rev. Mr. Gardner was born in Canton,
China, and lived there until he was 17
years old. He then went to Australia
and lived there three years. Then he
came to San Francisco, and he has resided
on the Pacific Coast of the United States
thirteen years. He first became publicly
known in San Franciscc as an interpreter
of Chinese in the Custom-house and the
Federal courts, whera his ability and
great proficiency as a Chinese scholar
speedily distinguished him. From San
Francisco he went to Victoria, B. C, and
became official interpreter of Chinese for
t^ie Canadian Gov> rnment. He remained
there until the office was abolished, find
ing time while he was interpreting for a
salary to serve gratuitously as a Chris
tian missionary among the Chinese.
Then he held the position of superintend
ent of the Chine c M. E. churches and
missions in British Columbia.
During this period he was continuously
in correspondence with philologists of re
pute. E P. Vinine, who wrote a history
of "An Inglorious Columbus,'' the Chi
nese discoverer of America, frankly ac
knowledged his debt to Mr. Gardner for
valuable assistance. But Mr. Gardner has
gone along quietly, his work to whicn be
is devoting so much of his life being un
known to the public. Personally he is
modest and unassuming, even shrinking
in speaking of himself. He said that be
is more enthusiastic now than when he
begun, and that he does not dread the
years of toil necessary to complete his
task.
"My purpose in the main," he said, "is
t,o put into Bnulish an exact reflex of the
history of 350,000,000 people from the
standard history of the preat empire.
The measures adopted by the ancient
founders of Chinese laws and customs
and scheme of eovernraent may have
i lessons for the present if they can be
| ascertained. In the main lam translat
ing the Chinese imperial history, but am
finding sidelights in many other Chinese
manuscripts. The ancient history of the
Chinese people extends back to between
3000 and 4000 years before Christ. Prior
to that is a period of Chinese mythology.
The antiquity of the Chinese may bÂ» im
-1 agiued from the fact that Confucius, 550
B. C, studied Chinese poets who were
then considered very ancient.
"The earth, so tne Chinese mythology
held, was chiseled out by Poon Koo, the
architect of the universe, with a great
chisel. That mythology does not pretend
to account for the presence of mankind on
the earth. I find that authentic history
does not begin with the Chinese much be
fore 2500 to 3000 years B. C. The exist
ence of coins, monuments, inscribed vases
and contemporaneous books is sufficient
corroboration for the events recorded from
that time onward in the official history.
China was a very old nation when other
great peoples were coming into national
existence.
"Chinese history falls naturally into pe
riods and in that way I shall treat it. In
the first place there were tne beginnings
of government. I could not say bow
many parallels are found, in that early
day, between the experiences of the Chi
nese and those of the early Jewish people.
They are many ana striking. The early
Chinese had kings who ruled them by
kindness and who seemed to think that
thrones were given by the Supreme Being.
The people at first all believed in one God.
They were monotheists. If they after
ward learned idolatry it was from the out
siders, particularly from India.
"The medieval period shows the origin
of literature and the visitation of Chi
nese to other countries and the visits re
ceived by them from foreigners. There is
no question that tho history is absolutely
authentic for 4500 years. Many centuries
ago Chinese astronomers gave a minute
and scientific account of the eclipse of
the sun, which has been completely veri
fied by the computations of American and
European astronomer?. The Chinese de
vised the civil-service system centuries
ago.
J'Think," said Mr. Gardner, "what a
theater has been here for the play of hu
man hopes, fears, passions and exploita
tions for thousands of years, all of which
can be opened for contemplation. China
has been as much an embattled country
through the centuries as European lands.
Once China was divided into seven war
ring states, every one fighting all its
neighbors. There h:ive been royal plots,
royal assassinations, gigantic wars, every
thing en a grand scale. So to speak, tne
history of a European country has been
made up of the annals of a corner of the
globe as compared with this great land
and hoary old nation that has outlived ?o
many natiurffs Mid may outlive many
more great peoples."
Mr. Gardner will not publish any part
of his history until ho has completed it,
which maybe possibly filteen years hence.
When his book of millions of words finally
is finished it will be as large as a small
modern library. Mr. Gardner is under 33
years of axe.

into a few hours, ot 3 in the

the closely shut housefronts and
the street lamps are reflected
in the wet streets, but the hurry and flurry
and rush of Christmas shopping goes on
unabated. It is a relief to pet away out of
the smoke and din to "green fields and

pale gray green, the evergreens are black
and drenched with rain; the other trees

on gray paper. The country has none of
the moist, dark richness of the California
winter landscape; it is very chill, and has
a frozen, silent look that is not without a
curious melancholy charm. Later in the
WILL CROSS THE ATLANTIC IN THREE DAYS
Ar\ /\mericar\ Electric Skip, Witk Fourteen Propellers, Jhat
Promises to Set a J^eW Speed Limit or\ the Sea
CK&LHERE will be tested this month at
/l^ Providence, R. 1., an electric ship of
JJIJS such marvelous speed that it will set
the tongues of all the world wagging. This
is the first announcement publicly made
of the fact.
Here a new record is to be born, a new
speed limit; or, rather, a speed without
limit, to be practically demonstrated.
The electrical wonder has no name as yet,
but she has fourteen propellers. George
A- Jencks, manager of the Painton Elec
trical Steamship Company of 155 Orange
street, Providence, R. 1., tells the writer
that from private trials there is no doubt
whatever of a forty-knot speed being
attained.
The ideas that have been put into prac
tical execution in this marine wonder
have been kept so carefully concealed
that few persons have had the remotest
notion that any such revolution in marine
engineering was even contemplated. Ever
since electricity has shown itself to be the
capital power of propulsion for vessels of
ligi-t proportions there have been endless
theories as to the possibilities of the power
in the future.
Now, however, we are to have practice
and not theory in the form of a ship that
will speed across the ocean and away past
Fastnet light and the Lizard in les3 than
three days. Think of an ocean voyage
that is much shorter and far more com
fortable, though the journey be from New
York to Southampton, than can be said
of a trip across our own United States.
The company which is to make the test
near Providence this month is in
corporated under the laws of Pennsyl
vania. Its president is Richard N. Pain
ton, and the other officers are: Vice-
President, John W.. Bailey; secretary,
Henry A. Solomon; and treasurer, Hiram
Weimer.
By the use of the Painton system of
electric motors it will be possible to ob
tain double the speed reached by steam,
and at about halt the cost, and with a
plant that will occupy not more than one
half the space now required for the pon
derous marine engines and accompany
ing machinery. Ocean "greyhounds"
equipped with the Painton motors will
easily cover forty knots an hour â railroad
speed. Warships will reach the speed of
thirty-five knots an hour, whereas the
highest limit yet accomplished on a trial
mile with steam is 22.80 knots with the
fastest cruiser built.
One great source of complaint with the
Navy Department has been the insuffi
ciency of room in war vessels for the ac
commodation of men, armament, coal and
provisions. The machinery necessary to
propel these great ocean fortresses occu
pies such a large amount of space that
there is practically no room for anything
else. The terrific heat from the furnaces
and steampipes, the maddening hissing
of the steam and the incessant vibration
and shocks resuliing from the wrerchiog
of the heavy shafts and the straining of
the mechanism make life almost unen
durable and converts the vessels into
veritable hells. They are torture prisons,
from which there is no escape.
The Pain ton system of motors will have
greatly enlarged power over steam, ana
as before stated the electrical plant will
occupy half the space of the steam plants.
Instead of the enormous 80-ton shafts ex
tending from the middle of the ship to the
stern the electrical plant will have from
fourteen to sixteen screw propellers rang
ing along the sides of the vessels as well
as two of ingenious construction at the
stern. These propellers are operated from
a switch board. They can be operated sin
gly or together at the will of the man at
the keys. Kach propeller is a machine by
itself, and the disabling of one or more has
no effect wiiatnver upon the others. When
the entire complement ot propellers is in
action there is no more noise than would
season, when the snow comes and
the rivers shine with ice, and the
atmosphere has a ringing clearness,
life will seem suddenly twice as well
worth the Jiving. The Great Northern train
that takes us away from London shoots
us through the country, rocking, snorting,
puffing at a rate that carries us half way
to Edinburgh almost at a mile a minute.
The windows are white with mist and a
clear space must bs rubbed away before

chimney-sweep, so covered is it with coal
dust, so dark and forbidding.
The low, black houses near the train;
the tall factories, -with chimneys that
alternately belch forth flams and smoke,
look like phantom houses in some of the
grewsome creations of Gustave Dore's
imagination. The great manufacturing
towns of Bradford and Leedsâ ugly, grim,
provincial â have taken the color of their
general surroundings, as insects adopt the
color of theirs.. Bradford, especially, with
come from the action of a fly-wheel.
There is no jar caused by the horizontal

piping; the long shafts are done away

account of the pitching of the yessel is
avoided. The total horsepower is dis
tributed throughout the entire system of
propellers, so that it would be absolutely
impossible to have more that one-quarter
of the whole power or propellers "racing"
at one time.
The engines that generate the power are
not mechanically connected with the pro
pellers, as is now the case in steam ves
sels, but the power is transmitted by elec
tric wires direct to motors built on
propeller shafts. The machinery is sim
plicity itself. No belting or coupling is
required. The propellers all work direct,
and, as before noted, they can be operated
singly or together. If one breaks down,
or two or three or any number, those that
are left can do the work. It would not be
possible for all to be disabled, as is now so
often the case with vessels equipped by
steam, leaving them flounderiug for days
at the mercy of the elements.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 3, 1897.
I its great warehouses in the valley and its
old stem, rather interesting municipal
buildings, with its somber, bleak rows of
plain-faced houses, dull and without char
acter, is particularly uninviting. Only as
we climb up the steep streets to the resi
dences, standing behind bare trees,
in the center of wide, frosty lawns,
with glacial ornamentations of arti
ficial rocks, do we lose the im
pression of a sordid manufacturing
town, a business center, pure and simple.
To leave Bedford for York is to step from
the nineteenth century back â how many
centuries? As many as tha imagination
cares to traverse. There is a legend that
York existed in the days whpn great King
David reigned in Israel. Perhaps to the
unambitious it will be well enough to go
back to the Romans, to Constantino who
lived there in his favorite English posses
sion, Eboracum. Do they not tell also
how King Arthur, sad and pale,
came there with Queen Gui
nevere to keep his Christmas fes
tival? How easy it is to people
again the ancient city asleep for ages ap.
power. There is practically no limit to
the speed of a screw operated by elec
tricity. Eighteen hundred revolutions
per minute and higher have been reached
by the Painton motors. In practice 650 to
800 revolutions per minute can be safely
depended upon.
In a large cruiser of, say, 20.000 horse-
power capacity, the transmission of power
by steam would be at the expense of about
33 per cent loss, or 6600 horsepower,
whereas by electricity the loss would be
only about 10 per cent, or 2000 horsepower,
which is a saving over steam of 4600 horse
power. This will reduce the coal consump
tion about 23 per cent, an important
economy. This with the great speed at
tained by the new idea of the distribution
of the propellers which tend to lift the
bow of the vessel so as to reduce the fric
tion of the water, will still further re
duce the coal consumption to about one
half that required for the generating of
steam power. The saving by electricity
extends through every part and feature.
There is a saving of time, of space and
Co3t of operation.
To illustrate: Where a steamship can
now only take coal enough to carry her
from New York to Liverpool, an elec
trically equipped vessel by the Painton
system could, with the sam^ quantity of
coal, sail from New York to Gibraltar and
the screw
of steam
parently behind its great wall; with its
Norman castle and a guild hail of the fif
teenth century; with its Roman gates and
the long, low streets of quaint houses.
Are we in England or in medieval Italy?
As we stand on the bridge at the river and
see over the irregular roofs and the cas
tellated gates and strongholds the
misty silhouette of York Cathedral against
the delicate wintry sky we wonder with
unavailing regret why in the rapid march
of conquest this nineteenth century of
ours cannot create many beautiful
towns, with beauty that is natural
and simple as well as pictur
esque. Gradually in almost all the
European capitals, the streets of dark,
quaint houses, with tneir gables and orna
mented windows jutting out over the
streets, with their richly decorated
facades, give way to the big, square
'block' of flats, pompous, clean, and ugly
enough to make one weep. How much
will the generation that will live at the
close of the twentieth century see of that
old time world? It is pleasant to feel that
we are still capable of a thrill; of a touch
of that deep enthusiasm that comes with
a sudden unexpected pleasure.
As we come through "Mickle Gate"âde
lightful name â and pass along the street
by the river, that is like a sheet of silver
gray satin, we come to the ruins of the ex
quisite nunnery, St. Mary's Abbey. That
is a tine preparatory thrill that we experi
ence. Tne trees seem to hold it in, to
support the beautiful walls, with their
eyeless windows, that once poured down
a soft radiance of stained glass, like those
in the great Minster itself. At the corner
we come upon two men, gorgeous in scar-
Jet coats, with silk fleshings and great
cocked hats; they hold staves in
their hr.nds, like a drum-major, and
as their eyelids move and one blows his
nose with an audible sound, we come to
the conclusion that they are aliveâ that
they are archiepiscopal grooms and not
visions ot glory, ghosts of ancient kings.
That knowledge ia a relief to our over
strained nerves, which are further startled
by a rich and familiar odor, that is ex
plained by a large sign over a factory that
tumbles irregular roofs down to the river
and that tells us that we are in the very
neighborhood, almost within the sacred
precincts, i.. which Rountree's chocolate
is manufactured. We fortify our spirits
with several penny packages, and then we
wander on aimlessly and find ourselves in
a long, narrow street called Stone Gate.
At the top of the long, low vista there is
the sight that makes the heart to beat!
It is the south front of the cathedral, with
the green, formeri} 7 the Archbishop's, gar
den, and the shattered palace behind it.
The chapter-hou3e, with its buttresses and
lofty roof and the great square battle
mented tower behind it, are included as
return to New York â three times the dis
tance. The vessel could carry a greatly
increased number of passengers and a
much larger quantity of freight. The
space now required for the vast steam
plant could bÂ» earning the owners of th
vessel a vast amount of money. An ocetfn
liner equipped with the Painton motors
can easily carry 2500 passengers in greater
comfort and with less danger than is now
incurred on steamships.
Another feature of the Painton system
is the fact that the screws tend to main
tain the equilibrium of the vessel at all
times. Eacn screw has a distinct lifting
power. The blades turn so that the pro
pelling force comes from below instead of
above, and as a vessel lurches from one
side to another or pitches the screws on
the side deepest in the water exert tre
menaous power to restore the craft to a
level. It would be as though a man were
to lurcb to one side'and receive the sup
port of a prop. When the vessel pitches
there is no loss of motion. When the
stern screws are idle and in air for a mo
ment the screws in the bow are working
as usual and exerting their tremendous
lifting power to put the stern of the boat
back to its proper equilibrium.
Ocean greyhounds which at present can
attain a speed of twenty knots an hour
under steam can, when fitted with the
Painton system of motors, easily attain a
speed of forty and more knots an hour,
which is in reality faster than the time
made by an ordinary railroad train.
With the success of the Painton boat
begins a new era in maritime history. It
means thnt the ocean will be robbed of
much of its peril. It places the con
tinental journey in the same category
with the tourist as the trip to the moun
tain or lake summer resort.
we step out of the narrow street into the
old square.
Old chronicles have it that when King
Edwin of Northumbria experienced "re
ligion" and wished to go through with
the solemn ceremony of baptism he in
sisted upon building: a church for the oc
casion. It was a little wooden structure,
which he afterward replaced with one of
stone. The windows were at that time
primitive openings, with^ sheets of oil
soaked linen to nil them.
As we enter the cathedral we see first
the oldest portions of that wonderful in
terior that has grown, as most of the
cathedrals have, to such a picturesque
and harmonious w hole, gradually; kings
and bishops adding, as tbey could, to the
original massive and simple design.
Nowhere in England, and hardly any
where in Europe, can we see stained class
in such magnificent perfection.
Nowhere else is it so admirably pre
served, nowhere else are we i. jso admir
ably preserved from that shock of new
glass, crude and coarse, set into the sub
dued glitter of the old. Immediately as
we enter we see that far-famed group of
lancet windows called the Five Sisters.

YORK, AS VIEWED FROM THE RIVER.
Standing beneath the tower we see be
tween the transept and each of
its four aisles the enormous arch
behind which are three more in vanish
ing perspective. At each point of view
the impression deepens; that won
derful dignity of arrangement, with
the windows breaking it so richly,
tilting the church with that soft, mellow
radiance that we miss so sorely in all save
Catho.Uc churches, where the lights of in
numerable candles, the tawdry but effec
tive artificial flowers and the gorgeousness
guiding his team between cars, wagons
and around street corners with an expert
ness born of lone praciic will give place
to the cool-headed motorman sitting in
the driver's seat, increasing or reducing
speed as the occasion may warrant by the
simple turning of a lever, and guiding the
apparatus in a similar manner.
But associations of the past have little
to do, however, with the present work of
the fire -fighters. Their one aim is to get to
the scene of action and get their life and
property saving apparatus into position
and ready for nse in the quickest possible
manner. The delay of a few minutes or
even seconds in reaching a fire may mean
life or death to those imprisoned in the
upper stories of a burning building, and
even with the utmost exertions of three
powerful horses nine times out of ten
the heavy ladder truck, witnout which the
work of fire-fighting is severely handi
capped, is the last to reach the scene, be
cause it is so heavy and unwieldy that
the lighter engines and hose- carriages
outstripped it in the race. All this will
be changed by the new invention.
In appearance the automobile firetruck
does not differ greatly from ins hook-and
ladder truck of to-day. There is the
same arrangement of Judders along the
body of the truck, the same footboard for
the crew and the manipulation of the rear
steering gear is the same. The radical
difference is in the arrangement of the
front wheels and the driver's seat.
The motive power of this automobile is
what is known as a compressed-air gas
engine of continuous running desien. It
is the invention of Reuben H. Plass of 508
Lafayette avenue, Brooklyn, N. V., ana
one of its principal advantages is that it
is always ready for use. All that is neces
sary is for the motorman to take bis seat
and move the operating lever.
The engine which furnishes the motive
power is placed just above the front axle
and directly beneath the driver's seat. A
system of cogwheels and levers actdirectly
between tie engine and the front wheels;
in fact, the entire machinery, which is
very simple and consists principally of
cogwheels, is located directly in front of
the engine, almost beneath the footboard
of- the apparatus.
Extending upward from the machinery
through the footboard and reaching to a
height a little above the driver's seat are
two levers which resemble those in com
mon use on cable-cars. One of these levers
is used for the double purpose of steering
the machine and as a brake, while the
other lever controls the speed of the en
gine. It can be reversed when necessary,

of the embroideries fill the color-lovine

The verier could give yon, I fear, a bet
ter description of the church than this
humble scribe; he could also tell you, in
harrowiii-' accents, bow a maniac con
cealed himself in the choir and set fire to
the church; he can people the aisles with
impressive pageants. Do they not *ay
that Henry 111 married Philippa here at
the altar? And that Philippa herself
came here to pray before going out to lha
victory of Neville's Cross? He can tell
you, too, of the pompous celebrations that
Richard inaugurated while his nephews
were being safely put out of the world in
the tower of London. There, too, Charles
I welcomed bis wife, and here Prince Ku
pert came belore tne battle outside the
wallsâ it is not a long walk to the blood
stained fields of Marston Moor.

things, but I will not. And here is a bit
of disinterested advice. Read the Ency

and in addition can be used as a supple
mentary airbrake.
The engine is so constructed that when
the driver tnkes his seat and grasps the
left-hand lever, the whole apparatus is
ready to start. By simply drawing the
lever toward himself, the driver sets the
truck in motion. The cogs on the lever
which work the wheels fall into another
set of cogs, which work directly from the
engine and the start is made.
A most peculiar feature is found in the
fact that in order to stop the truck it 13
not necessary to stop the engine. A for
ward pressure on the left-hand lever
tbrows the cogs out of place, and a pull on
the right-hand lever applies the com
pressed-air brakes. Should this not stop
the progress of the truck in a sufficiently
short time, the cogs can be thrown back
into place and the engine reversed and an
entire set of other brakes be applied to ihe
rear wheels of the truck.
Being a Brooklyn imui, and consequently
familiar with the many trolley accidents,
the inventor has paid especial attention
to the fender. This is automatic and ad
justable, just clearing ihe street, and ia
designed so that any person unfortunate
enough to be caught in it will escape, at
all events, alive and with a reasonable
certainty of little injury.
The truck can be driven at a speed of
forty miles an hour if necessary, and in
order that it can travel at a high rate of
speed over smooth and slippery pave
ments the tires of the wheels are rough
ened and provided, like a horse's hoof,
with corks or short spikes. This improve
ment has been found to be most success
ful, especially in turning sharp curves.
Another great advantage of the new in
vention is found in tha fact that the mo
tive power being so completely under con
trol it can be used immediately for elevat
ing an extension ladder, which is of the
greatest importance, both in the fighting
of fires ana in the saving of human life.

of Bernal Heights
is a weird, strange story of v
f\ -loaded goat, which has been care
jl^ fully led from Bernal Heights, at
UÂ«a<l of night, by a sad-faced man. As
â¢â¢lull as a goat" has been synonymous
with being "loaded," when applied to
bibulous persons from Kamschatka to
Key West. But this goat is not full, but
Joaded. Wituin the circumference of its
ribs is a load sufficient to tear down houses
and send goat meat fiyint' all over San
Francisco's sandy peninsula ana away
down into San Mateo County. At least
bo the story goes. It may be true and it
may not be true, but the rumor is grisly
and breath-estopping; an injunction to
hilarity and a midnight bogy.
John Haninn has kept his goat in his
yard weekdays and on Sunday lets it
nibble the sweet grass that grows adjacent
to the top of Bernal Heights. There is
not a gossoon or a colleen in all San Fran
cisco County who does not know Hanitin's
goat. Its gentle whinny bespeak the
softness and mildness of its altogether
charming disposition, and "as kind as
Hamfin's goat" has grown to be a proverb
among the lads and lassies where Bernal
towers toward the skies. When nnally it
has run its allotted course and has be
come valuable principally for its capacity
to be turned into goat leather, tears will
be shed and children will feel sad.
It was on Sunday that Hanifin's goat
really enjoyed life. From its eyrie it
could "survey the landscape o'er," gazing
placidly at the heights of the Twin Peaks
in one direction and at the City, which,
like a great gray panorama, lies unfolded
below. Gales come hustling over the
wind-swept heights, so that the gossoons
on the top hug the ground to avoid taking
a header and rolling with brenkneck sj eed
down toward the Cogswell School. But
Hanifin'B goat liked a fresh breeze and
Hanilin's heart beat with pride as he
looked upward and saw his beast dancing
and prancing on his hind feet up on the
apex, as secure against falling as if built
on a strong foundaiion and its legs all
pilasters.
The Bernal Heights boys ami girls of all
ages bail Sunday ior the glad view of ani
mated lite which it brings aiound every
seven days. The poundmau comes not
on that blessed day. So all tie goats in
the neighborhood are out and they bleat
and crop the grass with impunity and are
pay by tne dozens and hundreds. Some
times there is a clashing of horns when
two rival "billies" come together to fur
nish fun for the small boys. But really
the "billies" are the best friends, and on
weekdays they get fresh cuticle and goat
hair to replace that scraped oft" on Sun
day and dream s:x days through about
the fun they will have in a iutle shindy
on the seventh.
A few weeks ago a new family moved
to Bernal Heights. One of their be
longings was the biggest "billy" goat the
heights have ever seen. He nas the long
e-t and sharpest horns, the most mis
chievous disposition, the greatest amount
of pluck and vitality and the fun
niest eyes that nature ever has bestowed
on a goat with whiskers. He had not
been on the heights more than a week â
just one Sundayâ w"hen he demonstrated
his- prowess. Breaking from his tether he
had a bout witn every billygoat on the
luii'with the exception of Hanifin's miid
cyed beast. Hanifin's goat looked up
from its grass-cropping with a pathetic
expression in its eyes. The stranger
looted a minute and walked away. From
that minute all the gossoons and colleens
and even the one omadnoun on the hill
knew that they had misunderstood Hani
rin's goat and tnat it had fighting blood
after all.
But Hanifin's goat took on no airs.
Never did it look more peaceful than on
the day when it maae its dreadful fame,
which extends as far as "Scotch Hill,"
and even has found its way to the soat
fanciers and "all-around sports' 1 - ol tender
years on Telegraph Hill. It happened
this way. y
Hanifin got prouder of the goat than
ever and walked about with a chip on his
shoulderâ which the new family, who
scented trouble, did not care to knock off.
T:;e new family are named Connor or
O'Connor; which is correct does not much
matter for the purposes of Â»bii story,
which is one to point to a moral mainly.
Billy AJaroney and Jack Conarty, big
beys, made up a match after school and
arrangad to abduct Hanifin's goat and the
new goat, who hau already got the name
of "Hanible." The boys took tODS,
whistles, nickels and everything else for
the price of admission to the match, so
that they soon had all the movable prop
erty they could stagger under and were re
garded as topnotch monopolists and busi
ness men by the gossoons, and were ad
mired by the colleens accordingly. Pend
ing the match they fairly lived on candy
and cakes, which they got by swapping
off their admission pledges. They were
as Happy as boys acquiring indigestion by
this pleasing process could possibly be.
Hunifin knew nothing about the match
but his big boy Mike did, and the "ould
man" saw a queer, guilty look in Mike's
eyes one night at supper, and the boy
quaked, seeing that his dad was "on ;"o
him"; but it was only a blind lead, and
Hanitin did not more than scent mischief
without being able to locate it. The match
came off.
When the goats were led up to engage
in fray for the Bernal Heights champion
â¢hip they seemed in no hurry to begin.
"Hanible" was being led up the hill by
Billy \faroney. wh-n he spied a bunch of
thistles and glued himself to them, chew
ing at the spiky leaves with evident relish.
Billy couid not pull him and so kicked
him. The next second "Hanible" had
turned like a flash, had knocked Billy
Maroney on his back after several in
voluntary handsprings and was executing
a can-can upon his recumbent perion and
using His horns in a hiehly scientific and
vigorous fashion. When Billy Maroney
nnally got up, with the help of the small
boys who fousiit "Hanible" cff, there was
a big red swelling on his ri^ht cheek
where he had been gored, his nose was
bleeding and he was breathing very hard,
but was still game, and took "Hanible's"
rope once more and led the beast to the
battle-ground.
Hanilins goat going to battle made no
trouble. He walked along peaceably
enough, with head down and an air of
meekness about him that mads all the
gossoons laugh.
"Aw, he's no good. Hanible will use
him for a choppin' block."
That seemed to be the case. The Hani
fin goat could not be coaxed to rear ud on
his hind legs or to butt. Mike Hamfin
was in despair.
â¢'Whist!" he said. "I know what he
wantsâ milkweed."
Mike was off like a shot and after a
little was seen toiling up the hill once
more. In his arms he carried a five-gallon
oilcan bristling full of weeds. The Hani
fin goat smelled them afar and his
eyes twinkled with glee, while he emitted
the most pathetic and coaxing whinny of
which he was capable.
"Good boy," said Mike, admiringly.
"Wait a little, boys, until he gets a nip
and then he'il be read}- for you."
The o;lcan was just iarue enough for the
goat to get his nose in. He beean to make
a crunching noise as the edible weeds
were crushed between his teeth.
"Hanibie" smelled the weeds, too, and
made for the oilcan. The Hanifin goat
heard him coming and looked up. There
was danger of losing bis feed, and the
Hanifin goat, with one eye on Hanibie,
hastily tried to resume his feed. In some
way he got his horns inside the can.
When he raised his head he was wearing
a tin helmet, of which he vainly tried to
free himself.
Then it was that the real fighting blood
of Hanifin's goat asserted itself. Blinded
as it was, it made a rush for Hanible,
thinking that this was a trick put up on
him by his rival.
Crash! bang! The tin helmet struck
Hanibie comerwise sauarely in the mid
dle of its forehead, and that animal
turned tail and ran, frightened by this
strange thing on four goat legs.
"Hooray!" shouted Mike Hanifin;
"he's off."
Mike's triumph was short-lived. The
goat went in his direction and hit
him in the wind, and he doubled up
like a jackknife and went down bellow
ing.
Then Billy Maroney was bucked off his
feet, ana half a dozen other boys were
rolled over, and thera was a panic among
them which speedily became a rout. They
ran down the slopes like a party of charg
ing Apaches, and the Hanifin goat, line
Jill in the nursery ballad, "came after."
Yes, the Hanifin goat came after with a
rush.
Hanifin had a half day off and he
reached home just as the goat charged
down hill. There is no doubt that he was
astonished, as he had :he right to be. He
did the best thing he could to divert the
goat's attention, which was to drop his
dinner pail, which he had in his hand and
run. The goat chased Haniiin, who ran
so that all Bernal Heights was d-lighted.
Biff! bmg! whan}?! came the goat up
against Hanifin's front fence just us Han
ifin tnrabled over it into his wife's flower
bed, breaking down ali her "Lady Wash
ington" geraniums and kicking into
smithereens a small greenhouse which
it had taken Mrs. Hanifin's brother half
a day to build. Hanifin had hardly got
on his feet before the coat with the tin
heimet on its head was chasing him
around the yard, following him by the
sound of his footsteps and the curses
which he audily emitted.
Wlien this part of the entertainment
was over the Hanifin goat backed out and
got Tom Hannegan in chancery and was
likely to puncn the breath out of him for
pood, but Tom got hold of the oilenn and
Maroney pulled at the goat's tail and
something had to give. The tail was on
stronger than the can, and so the can
came off first. Daylight bursting on the
Eroat it at once maue a bee line for Hani
fi:;'s overturned dinner pail, and before
Hanifin appeared on the scene with a
club, with wrath in his eye and fragments
of rosebush in ail other parts of his anat-
omy, the goat had eaten up all the dinnei
pail's contents.
"Jumpin' beeswax!" said Hanifin. "All
you fellers run for your lives. That dom
goat has gone and tilled hisself with dyna
mite and he may go off any minute."
At first the *pectntor3 only laugheJ, but
when they were solemnly assured that the
goat had really swallowed half a dozen
dynamite cartridges which Hanifin had
expected to use in a little private blasting
work the situation was found to be serious.
The wild-eyed goat had enough dynamite
in him to destroy the new City Hall.
Hanifin dropped liis club and his knees
knocked together with fear.
"Whoa, Billy; so, Billy," he said.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUABY 3, 1897.
SKETCHES CONTRIBUTED FOR THE BENEFIT OF EMIL NARJOT.
The Hanifin goat leared in the air, recol
lecting his recent experience, and made for
Hanifin like a runaway railway train, and
carrying his load of dynamite w.th him.
"Wboo-pee!" yelled Hanifin.
''Gee!" yeiled all the boys in chorus.
The goat ran awhile after every one in
sight. Tnen he stood on his hind legs and
performed a little "fancy drill," dancing
and caracoling and prancing, watched by
fascinated and terrified spectators who
expected to see a great explosion any time.
Probably the layers of ham sandwich
which the goat found in the pail were
between the dynamite missiles and pre
vented concussion, but if ever any animal
has templed fate since Noah's menagerie
came ashore, it was Hanifia's goat. He
butted fences. He courted conflicts with
other goats. Some strange and perverse
influence caused him to iie down and roll.
In every way he tried to touch off the
dynamite and to commit suicide, going
out to the unknown with a boom.

Art comes to Aid
the Blind Narjot
Thirty sketches hang on the walls of
the Hopkins Institute at present that
have been contributed by the artists of
San Francisco for the benefit of Eniil Nar
jot. Truly they form a creditable and
representative collection of the work ot
the contributors. There is not a single
example of what would be called an ambi
tious picture in the lot, but all of them
are of the best the painters were capable
of executing. Nearly all of them are stu
dies direct from nature, and several of
them are -gems in their way.
Several of the sketches are quite valua- I
ble, and all of thrm are interesting. They
comprise a wide range of subjects and are
varied in treatment. In lact, the artists
gave the best they had for the benefit of
their stricken fellow-worker. There are
no titles to these sketches, and indeed
they do not need them, for all of them
explain themselves. Following are tbe
names of those who have contributed
sketches:
William Keith sends a fair-sized land
scape In pastiles. It is in his best style,
good in color and handled loosely, so that
it is most suggestive of nature in one of
her pleasantest moods.
Arthur Mathews is represented by a bay
scene. This work is simple in composi
tion, but very true to nature. It is good
in color and full of action and life.
Amadee Joullin sends the only full
length figure in the lot. It is one of his
best works and shows a figure in Oriental
costume. There is, of course, a great deal
of bright color, but on the whole, the ef
fect is pleasing and harmonious.
R. D. Yelland is represented by one of
his characteristic evening scenes. This is
in pastel, and is a pleasing and creditable
piece of work, good in color and drawing.
E. Pissis sends a picture that is line a
glimpse of sunny France. The colors are
somewhat cool, but the effect is good.
J. A. Sianton : s picture shows a char
acteristic view of some old buildings in
Brittany. They are wonderfully true to
nature and highly interesting. The color
ing of the old walls is particularly good.
H. R. Bloomer sends a landscape that is
highly f-uggestive of England. It is a
pleasing subject and well painted.
Thomas Hill's contribution is one of his
late works. It is cbaracteristic of his
style and strongly depicts a scene in the
mountains of California â most liKeiy the
Shasta region. In quality this picture is
quite a departure from the work that Mr.
Hill gained his reputation on.
Hugo Fisher sends a little tropical
lacoon â one of the pictures painted by
him while on his recent trip to the Ha
waiian Islands. It is rich in color and
characteristic of the country it represents.
S. M. Strauss sends a study from nature
that was made at Camp Goodall.
L. r. La timer's contribution is one of
the wooQ interiors he paints so well.
There are several good points about it.
Edwin Deakin sends a good-sized can
vas in oil depicting a scene on the Seine.
It is carefully worked and the color is rich
and brilliant.
C. D. Robinson contributes a moonlight
marine view. This is somewhat cold in
color, but the general effect is not bad.
C. F. Jesseff, a late arrival here from
Australia, sends a sketch made at Hono
lulu that is bright in color and pleasing in
effect.
J. M. Jambles sends a pastel sketch from
nature, representing a bit of the Alameda
marsh.
A. J. Bruer contributes one of his small
palette knife pictures that are so pleasing
and suggest so much of nature.
There is a particularly good still life
study from the brush of Oscar Kunath.
It is very snbdued in tone, but the values
are carefully studied and the general effect
is strong.
A group of buildings by J. Sodert is a
good piece of work, well drawn and good
in color.
Chris Jorgensen sends a woodland road
that has some work in it.
C. J. Hittel sends a small landscape.
R. C. Curtis contributes a small water
color representing one of the many
wharves to be found around San Francisco.
Chapel Judson is represented by one of
his characteristic landscapes of good size.
There is some good study in it.
W. Hubacek and A. J. Brigss are repre
sented by creditable sketches of out-of
door studies.
Miss Withrow, Miss Chittenden and
Miss Bender are represented by flower
studies that are highly creditable pieces of
work.
There are a few contributors of very
good sketches who failed to sign their
work, so their names cannot be given.
It is the intention of the art association
to dispose of these pictures some night
during the coming week. They will be
distributed by lot to subscribers to the re
lief fund of Emil Narjot. Several hun
dred dollars have already been subscribed
and every cent obtained will be given to
the sick artist.
Since Erail Narjot lost the use of his eyes
A3 a result of doing the decoration of the
Stanford tomb at Palo Alto he has slowly
grown worse, so that now he is absolutely
destitute. For a time he seemed to be on
the road to recovery from his eye trouble,
but in some way paralysis set in and his
case became hopeless. His faithful wife
has done what she could for the last four
years, but at last has been taken sicK her
self. Friends have helped the family in
different ways, but more money is needed,
and is sure to come in a few day 3.
Emit Narjot is one of the best-known
artists in California. He came here in the
early days, and the future will have to de
pend on his work for pictures of life dur
ing the exciting times of the gold fever.
His work is of a high order, particularly
when it is considered that he had very lit
tle of an art education.
Makart Made Them Famoni.
In many of the famous Hans MaKart's
ereatest paintings occur again and again
two exquisite examples of beautiful
womanhood. In his "Diana" and Charles
V Entering Antwerp" they are the most
conspicuous figures, and immediately at
tract the observer's attention. The models
of these figures were the two daughters of
Herr Klinkosch, a leading gold and silver
smith of Vienna. Makart made the girls
famous, and they became the rage of the
Viennese court, and until recent years â
ana may yet, for all we tnow â moved in
the very best society.
The Octopus Whick
the Astorians SaW
Pf EOPLE are still talking about the
which drifted ashore atTilla
* mook. The most absurd and prepos
terous stories are current about its appear
ance, and as no one cared to save it, it
floated to sea on the next tide after it was
stranded and they cannot now be dis
proved. There is no doubt that it was a
well-developed specimen of the cepha
lopod mollusk, known in Northern Eu
rope as the kraken, to Hercules as the
Lernean Hydra, to Victor Hugo as the
pieuvre or devil-fish and to people in gen
eral as the Octopus vulgaris. It has often
been caught on the coast of Vancouver
Island.
It bad a small body about as large as a
good-sized football and eight arm?,
four on each side. These are said by
ignorant observers to have been furnished
witn jaws ana teeth; in fact, they were
toothless, bat each arm had a row of
suckers, near a hundred in number, sup
ple as ltaiher, tough as steel, cold as
night, which could fasten themselves so
tenaciously to an object that the arm
might be torn off before they detached
their hold. Several hundred such mol
lu-sks have been caught in the waters of
this coast, but no case has ever been re
ported in which they attacked a swimmer
or even a corpse.
In Victor Hugo's story, "The Tollers of
the Sea," Gilliott thrust his arm into a
crevice in the rocks and suddenly felt
himself seized. Something slender, rough,
adhesive, chilling and living was twisting
itself in the gloom round his naked arm.
After a desperate struggle he succeeded in
cutting himself free with his knife and
killing the animal. In describing the
modus operandi of the devil-fish in de
vouring a man M. Hugo says: "You en
ter into the beast; the hydra incorporates
with the man; the man is amalgamated

tiger can only devour you; the devil-fish
inhales you. He draws you into him;
bound and helpless you find yourself
slowly emptied into the frightful sac,
which is a monster. To be eaten alive is
more than terrible; to be drunk alive is
inexpressible."
In this thrilling description M. Hugo
gives the rein to his imagination, as is his
wont. The devil-fish does not imbibe its
victims by suction, but tears tnem in
pieces with its powerful beak and devours
them bit by bit. It could no more swal
low a man than the whale swallowed
Jonah, for its whole body is half the size
of a man's head.
But there is no question of the power of
the octopus to drown a man by holding
him under water with its tentacles. John
K. Ward, in his book on British Colum
bia, speaks of one whose arms were live
feet long and as thick as a man's wrist.
It was almost impossible to detach his
hold from a rock. But the octopus does
not feed on human fiesb. Its favorite food
is crabs.
When it gets a crab in a corner, it en*
circles him with its arms and holds him
fast; then it drives its powerful beat
tbrou. h the creature's shell and pic&9 out
the meat. In the Mediterranean the skulls
and bones of drowned men have been
found in tbe vicinity of rocks which are
known to be inhabited by devil-fish, and
hence they have been supposed to be man
eaters. But the corpses had probably
been eaten by crabs, which had fallen
victims to the man-eaters after they had
fattened on human flesh.
As with some other crustacrea the limbs
er arn.s of the octopus reproduce them
selves when they are severed from the
body. Among the ancients it was believed
that when driven to desperation by hun
ger the octopus will eat its own arms, but
there seems to be no truth in the theory.
When an octopus swims, its arms drag
behind the body like a tail so that the
animal resembles a cat o' eight tails;
creatures which feed on it like the whale
and the conger eel, failing to overtake it,
themselves with biting off one or
more of the tails, which the moliusk bears
with philosophy, knowing that the loss
can be readily repaired. One of the most
curious revelations .of prehistoric animal
life is the discovery of parts of the arms
of the octopus in the caprolytes of the
ichthyosaurus. In the aquarium at
Havre, in France, when business is dull,
the curator advertises a duel between an
octopus, and a party of conger eels.
The octopus at first endeavors to escape
by ejecting the dark fluid, which for a
time renders it invisible. As the water
gradually clears an eel dashes upon the
foe and seizes the ties 1 of a limb; then,
backing away, it whirls round with
rapidity until the limb is wrenched from
the body. This performance is repeated
till every limb is torn off in turn and
nothing is left of the creature but the
round ball which contains its eyes,
mouth and internal organs, and it dies
from inability to hunt its prey.
The octopus is eaten on the shores of
the Mediterranean, and fishermen make
a living by spearing it for market. Among
the old GreeKs it was esteemed a choice
luxury. Athenseus, in his "Deipnoso
| phists," quotes a fragment of the poet
| Machon on the subject.
They say Philoxenus, the ancient poet
of dithyrarnbics, was so wonderfully at
tached to tisb that once at Syracuse he
bought a polypus two cubits long, then
cleaned it and then ate it up himseif, all
but the head, and afterward iell >ick,
I seized with a sharp attack of indieestion.
I Then some doctor came to see him,
| who saw that be was greatly out of order.
"If," said the doctor, "you have any busi
ness not well arranged do not delay to
settle it, lor you will die bsfore six hours
ore over. " Philoxenus replied: "All my
affairs, O doctor, are well ended and
arranged long, long ago, but now since
deadly fate calls me away who can not be
disobeyed, that I may go below with all
my goods, bring me the relics of that
polypus."
That there exist in the sea gigantic
specimens of the octopus, which have
been named indifferently squids, cuttle
fishes and calamarys, is not to be denied.
People have been in the habit of laughing
at De Montfora's account of one of these
which threw its arms over a three-masted
vessel, snapped off its masts, tore down
the yards and would have dragged it to
the bottom if the crew baa not succeeded
in cutting oft its immense limbs wiih cut
lasses and hatchets; also of fix French
men-of-war which were crippled by simi
lar monsters, and thus became
i prize to the English; but there
is no doubt the French market-boat
Alecton in 1861 ran across, near Ma
deira, a specimen which measured
sixteen to eighteen feet in length, without
the arms; nor can the reports of the dis
covery of two gigantic cuttle-fishes on the
coast of Newfoundland in 1873 and 1874
be regarded as fables.
Portions of one of these creatures were
examined by Professor Verrill of Yale
College, and he found that the body was
10 feet long, the diameter being 2 feet 5
inches, and the arms being 32 feet long.
The other octopus was 7 feet long, the
long arms 24 feet, and the shorter arms 6
feet long; the largest of the latter being
10 incnes in circumference at the base. It
need hardly be added that cieatures of
sucu dimensions could upset a boat, carry
off its crew to the submarine depths, and
devour them at leisure. Nor is to be
rashly asserted that cuttle-fishes of this
size do not exist in the waters which wasu
the Pacific Coast.
The Last Flight of
the Garrier Pigeon.
A little carrier pigeon met death in a
curious way the other morning while at
tempting to cross the br.y from this city to
his iiome in the loft of George H. Croley
in Alarueda. Mr. Croley keeps a poultry
supply store in this city, and being an
ardent fancier of the gentle homers fre
quently brings some of his feathered pets
to this side to give them a fly home lor
practice. Among a recent lot of bctners
raised in tbe Croley loft was a yellow
checker designated as E 1108 which irai
thought from his short early flights to be
an unusually promising bird. Desiring to
?ee how quickly he could make the Might
home Mr. Croley bronght him over as he
came to business and liberated him at 8:30
in the morning.
When he returned home that night he
was surprised to find that the checker had
not turned up, and concluded that he
must have become the prey of a hawk. A
day or two later T. C. Leydecker, another
Alameda fancier, brought Mr. Cro'ey the
body of poor little Â£ 1108 and told the
story of his death.
The young bird, after soaring high
enough above the buildings of the City to
get his bearings, started faithfully for
home,* but fell a victim to misplaced con
fidence. While crossing the water he
spied the ferry-boat steamer Bay City, and
being, perhaps, a little tired concluded to
take a rest on her.
Either because cf the fact that the
steamer was moving, or because his tired
Mule wings would not euide him aright,
he missed the pilot-house, and, striking
the whistle-cord, fell to the deck with a
broken neck.
The master of the vessel brought the re
mains to this side, and turned it uvr to
Mr. Leydecker, whom he knew to be a
fancier, and thus the battered body found
its way tc its owner.

THEY'RE ENGAGED.
Some Interesting Betrothals Are \
Made Public
ThÃ engagement is announced of Miss Sarah
de Camp Bluxome to J. Benjamin Wooster.
Miss Bluxome is the third daughter of the late
Popular Plar\ for fair-piavjirvg.
Individual duplicate, sometimes called
Bingle-tabie duplicate, which involves the
overplay of the hands by the same playeic,
is seldom or ever played among expert whist
players and straight whist has long ago been
relegated to a back seat, as far as match games
as a test of skill are concerned, as it amounts to
about as much as throwing dice, although the
game is sometimes put into a tournament as
sort of a "consolation" dish. The Trist Dupli
. cate Whist Club have a plan ready to be intro
â¢ Cuced after the holidays of "club pairs." By
this scheme each pair plays against every other
pair, not as in the system now in use, where half
of all the players play against the other half;
and thea the score reckoned on the average
system, it is entirely different. Each pair
plays one side or the other of every hand, and j
are compared for results with those pairs who j
hold and play the same cards. To accomplish j
this it only requires (without duplication of
deals) the least number of deals possible, viz. :
one less than the number of pairs contestingâ '<
â  for example, it only requires 7 deals for 10
players, and so along up; or if there were G4
contestants but ,31 deals. In other words,
25 pairs can play a match against 25 pairs
with 49 deals, of which each pair would play
one side or the other of all. This will be a
great improvement on the present unsatisfac
tory merry-go-round fashion. It is a sty;e of
game that is entirely new.
When the evening's contest Is over each
player not only has his total made out tor
himself, and at once, but he knows just whom
he has beaten and just who have beaten him.

Trist Duplicate Whist Club Match.
A straight whist contest (?) took piece last
Monday evening in the rooms of the Trist
Duplicate Whist Club for the possession of the
Payot straight-whist trophy. This sort of
whist play is no test of skill whatever and
should be abolished. The winners could as
easily be determined by throwing dice as by
playing the cards. If the donor of this ele
gant tropny, which, by the way, is far hand
somer than the Hideout trophy, had offered it
for club pairs, restricting the number so that
each pair could play a match of a certain
number of deals against each pair of the op
posing club and have the whole constitute one
contest or match the interest taken would be
far greater than in even the Hideout trophy
games. At the annual meeting of the A. W. L.
no contest takes place outside of the Hamilton
and A. W. L. that excites the interest that is
taken in club pairs. A .sort of three-cornered
match wus played for this trophy a couple of
weeks ago, when the Trist Club won it. The
clubs competing were: Oakland, San Fran
cisco and Trist. Both clubs having challenged
for the trophy, the San Francisco Club played
both matches at one time. If both the Oak
land and Trist had won the trophy would have
been claimedâ and rightly, tooâ by both clubs.
In the last match the San Francisco Club won
by twelve tricks.

GerxterVilk to Be Congratulated
There is a fair prospect of a whist club being
formed in the beautiful little city of Center
vllle, Alameda County. We know of one en
thusiast in Ceuterville that is a whole whist
clnbin himselfâ C. W. Riser. Weknow Charlie
is called a "whist crank" because be knows
tho necessity ol studying the game to become
proficient in it. The nucleus of tho new club
is H. W. Emerson, F. M. Smith, R. E. Smith, M.
Norris. J. Norris, B. Emerson, C. Emerson,
Dr. Emerson, F. T. Hawes. F. Dusterberry, F.
Eggers and the champion fisherman of the

JYliltorv G. Work's Words of JYaise.
Mr. Work is known all over this country as
the first whist author who had the courage of
his convictions to come ouc and sag} in print
.what other writers dare not. .His work,
"Whist of To-day," has had a wonderful circu
lation. He is also Whist Editor of the Even
ing Telegraph of Philadelphia, the only paper
published in the world that has a daily whist
column. In speaking of our whist queen's
new book he says: ''A most valuable addition
to the literature of whist is 'Whist Rules," by
Miss Kate Wheelock, the 'Whist Queen.' Miss
Wheelock easily ranks as the most successful
of the many able whist teachers of the d&v,
and the experieuce she has gained in im part
ing the theories and rules of the game to her
many pupils has evidently proved of great
value to her in her present work, as 'Whist
Rules' is a model of clearness, conciseness and
accuracy.
"It imparts information in a manner that is
attractive, and also most apt to make a lasting
impression upon the reader's mind. We pre
dict that many who are unable to become
members of Miss Wheelock's classes will find
in 'Whist Rules' a simple, clear and reliable
guide, and that it will prove a boon to all who
are trying to 'learn whist without a teacher. 1
"Miss Wheelock's pupils will find it as a text
booK a most valuable supplement to her les
sons."
Women's Whist League.
The formation of a Women's Whist League
has taken another Step forward by the follow
ing committee being appointed to isaue a call
for a meeting of women whist players of Amer

The tournament committee have received
assurances from fully half the members of
their intention to take part in the annual

by the various clubs are likely to find their
way across the bay after the battle is over.
The Rldeout teams have not yet been chosen.
The lady members of the club intend giving
the gentleman another opportunity to distin
guish themselves, a series of gamesâladies vs.
gentlemenâ having been arranged for the first

Hereafter the ladies will play at the club
rooms on Thursday afternoon, and now hope
and expect visitors from the City over very
frequently. It would be a pleasure to the Oak
land members if teams of four or eight ladies
from the San Francisco and Trist clubs would
arrange to play in Ouklana 'alternate Thurs
day at ternoons.

Pacific Yacht Club Will
Have Six Fifteen-Foot
Yachts.
Monthly Races Will Be Held
for Points and Also for
a Trophy.
An Idea to Be Adopted Which Has
â â¢ : Been Beneficial to Yacht Clubs
in the East
The Pacific Yacht Clnb has about ma
tured plans for the introduction of a fleet
of small yachts, six in number, of thesfcip
jack model, fifteen feet on the water-line,
carrying a jib and mainsail, and practi
cally not capsizable or sinkable, the idea
being to secure perfect safety to the ama
teurs and uninitiated yachtsmen. This
announcement is made by J. D. Maxwell,
the secretary, who has sent out a circular
letter to members, which, is, in part, as
â¢ follows:
â  . Four of the six are now pledged and the
.. other two promised for January next. TLese
boats will become the property of the clud for
â¢â â¢. monthly contests and lor tlie free use of all
"members. This plan has grown to large pro
. portions in the East, and such a fleet has
been sadly lacking in our cub.
â  The beneficial results of tnis proposition to
yachting interests will begin with ourselves
und extend to eveiy club on the bay.
Monthly races will be ne.d winter and sum
mer, with two menroers alternating in each
boat. Points will be given for finisa posi
tions, and the crew receiving the greatest
number of points during the series will take
the trophy. There will be first, second and
third prizes. The cost of these yachts will not
exceed Â£150.
The icmr that are given thus far are made
â¢up as follows: Two members offer one boat
â each, makiug two: three members club to
gether, paying $50 each, for a boat; and three
other members do the same, making iour in
nil. All boats to be named by the contribu
tors, and all boats to re7ert to the donors in
case the monthly races should be discon
.'â  tinuei.
it is scarcely possible for the secretary to see
eacn member personally; thereiore, kindly
commumcute with him if you are willing to
do auy;huiK in ths completion or enlarge
ment "of the new small fleet. The directors
have given this clan careful study. Jt is of
vitsl importance and should be seriously con
sidered by every loyal member of the club. In
short, it means the rehabilitation and preser
vation of the Pacific Yacht Club.
At a regular meeting of the directors of
the- Paciiic Yactit Club, held December 22,
it was decided to reduce the annual dues
to $12, beginning January 1, 1897. and also
ilia t dues may be payable in such install
ments as may best suit the financial con
venience of each member. It is thought
that tijis action will be of advantage to
the club.
A duck breakfa-t will be given bj the
Pacinc Yactit Club at the cluui.ouse next
Sunday at noon, in honor of John H.
D.clrinson, who has been elected a State
fcenator.
Directors Charles H. Crocker, Hupo
Keil and Will A. Powning have tendered
: their launches. Wanderer, Cynthia and
â \Vai.'ele, rain or shine, for conveying those
. â  in attendance to and fro between the
. steamer landing and clubhouse. Mem
bers desiring cards for themselves or thei-r
friends must obtain them from the secre
. , tary' on or before Friday, January 8, in
order that the steward may fully provide
. tee ducks and other good things for every
. . lady and gentleman present. The 11
o'clock Sausalito ferry-boat should be
taken by members who do not go by a
launch.

THE IfiON DUKE EEASONS.
And by Doing So Helped U niself in the
Chase as Well as in Battle.
It is told of the Duke of Wellington
that he was once out f.jx hunting, when
the hounds on reaching the bank of a
Etna!! river lost the sient. The master of
the hounds apologized to the Duke. ''I'm
afraid, your Grace, our fun is over. The
dogs can't pick up the scent."
"Ten to one, !> replied the Duke, "the
fox has crossed to tiie other side."
"Not very likely, my lord. A fox hates
water."
â¢Aye, aye." unred the Duke, "but he
may have crossed over by some bridge."
"I don't believe there i* a bridge," an
swered the master of the hounds.
"Well," continued the Duke, "unless
you know to the contrary, though I was
nover here beforp, I will wager a tritla you
will find one within a mile."
The two men, followed by the hunt,
pushed on, and less than a mile off came
â upon a rudely constructed bridge. The
dog.Â» cros>ed it, again took up the scent
and killed : he fox. Asked for his reason
for asserting thai there was a bridge near,
he answered: "I saw three or four cottages
clustered together on each bank of the
river, and I thought the people living in
lhem would be tempted hy their social
feelings to contrive a means of visiting
. each other. That same inference of mine
rained me one of my battles." â London

SUSPENSE IN CHINATOWN
The Chinese Will Now Take
Vengeance Into Their
Own Hands.
"Little Pete" Accused of a Shrewd
Scheme to Nonplus the Efforts
of the Poiice.
There is going to be trouble in China
town at no very distant date if the proph
ecy of the police counts for anything, and
in this instance it would seem to De forti
fied with cumulative evidence of a pretty
strone character. The bee Yups, the Chi
nese say, killed Lo How, a Sam Yap man,
on btockton street, the Sam Yups retali
ated by murdering Chew Ging, a See Yup,
and now the Bee Yups have the hatchet
out to carry on the feud.
It will be remembered that when Ser
geant Wollweber interviewed Chew Lee
Keong, the brother of Chew Ging, he said
he would do all in his power to aid the
police in discovering the murderer. But
when the police arrested Do Ming and two
others for the murder no one appeared to
identify them as the men wanted.
So Sergeant Wollweber went to 724
Commercial street, where Chew Keong
lives, to get him to come down and see if
the right man had been secured. Keong
was not there. But a Chinaman in the
house gave Wollweber to understand that
Keong wouid not appear to identify any
body who might be arrested, but would
get satisfaction in a different way. This
remark waa significant. It demonstrated
clearly that tbe Chinese do not intend to
ai â¢ in bringing tbe murderers to justice,
but will be revenged with bullet or steel.
The sergeant went apain the next day to
tbe same place in quesi of his man, but he
was attain aosen . This time, however,
there were several Chinese in the house,
and they told him in so many words that
they would take the law into their own
hands.
There is another reason why the Chinese
do not care to carry cases into court â
because they claim the cost is too great in
proportion to tbe amount of satisfaction
received. The Chinese are pretty shrewd
in criminal matters and their heads are
crammed witli resources for every emer
gency.
la this hffair, from the testimony of
Chinese on the inside of the case, the po
lice have been badly fooled. They have
worked hard and displayed forethought,
so these Chinese say, but they were duped
just the same.
The manner in which the Chinese ex
plain the character of the game shows its
ingenuity. "Little Pete," a Chinese rnn
ning a i ambiing-house on Jackson street,
above Dupont, is said to Do the ring
leader. He ia also said to be interpreter
for the Wah Ting San Ton Â£, the society
responsible for Uing's death, and its>elf
composed of three bodiesâ the Gi Sin
Seer, the Bo Sin Seer and the Bing On.
In order to throw the police off the
track, "Little Pete" is accused of hiring
Do Ming and the other heathen to go to
jail long enough to give the real criminals
a chance to escape, with the promise that
they would be proved innocent and re
leased as soon as the coast was clear. The
fact is that the police bad to release the
men for lack of evidence. These charges
are made by the Suey Sing, of which
Chew Ging wad a prominent member.
Chew Ging was alÂ«o a member of Hie Bo
Leong and the Hip Sing, long?. The mem
bers of these societies held a meeting last
Friday, but decided to <io nothing in the
way of retaliation for Ging's death, as he
was regarded as a renegade for Having
joined the Suey Sing. Ging's relatives and
the Sney Sing may be depended upon to
see that somebody immortalizes the Mosaic ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 3, 1897.
dictum of ''an eye for an eye and a tooth
for a tooth," by giving up the ghost.
As it is now the police are hourly ex
pecting trouble, and a special detail of
eight police are patroling both night and
day the region of Cum Cook. Baker, Spof
ford and Sullivan alleys, Waverly place
and Dupont, Washington and Jackson
streets. Sergeant Wollweber is giving his
time almost exclusively to the "Chinese
question."
The Sam Yaps claim that the Wah Ting
San Tong is not to blame for Ging's death,
but that tbe recent murders in reality are
a reopening of thi old Kuna: Chow Asy
lum trouble. The the ry of a gambling
dispute is also brought forward.
ARTIFICIAL EAIN.
Unique and Interesting Experiment In
Which a Tempest In Made in a Bottle.
M. Errera, professor at the University of
Brussels, has succeeded, and by a very
simple process, ia making artificial ram.
All that he uses is a bottle of Bohemian
glass which is covered with an ordinary
porcelain saucer and is half-filled with al
cohol of 92 degrees strength. He heats
this bottle in a bath of water until the al
cohol, the sides of the bottle and the sau
cer are of an a.most equal temperature.
Then be takes it out of tbe bath, places it
carefully on a table and observes it
closely.
He is rewarded by an interesting sight.
The vapor of the alcohol soon rills the
bottle, but the saucer cools rap dly and
the vapor, being warmer, becomes con
densed as soon as it comes in contact with
it. The upper air in the bottle also
j quickly becomes of a lower temperature
and real clouds soon appear. These speed
ily become dissolved into a multitude, of
tiny raindrop-, which fall thickly, just as
an ordinary rain shower.
The bath of water performs the function
of the sun, the alcohol represents the
ocean; the clear space beneath the saucer
may be compared to the pure sky, which
dominates the somber mass of clouds and
the upper air in the bottle, chilled by con
tact witti the. saucer, plays the role of the
cold atmospheric curr nts which bring
about the condensation of vapor into
clouds.
We see, then, that the phenomenon is
faithfully reproduced in all its details. "Â« A
still more striking 'result can be obtained
by using a cold saucer in place of the
warm one. In that case the difference of
temperature will be increased and we can
witness a regular old-fashioned storm or
hurricane. This It, indeed, a tempest in
a bottle.â York Herald.

Development of the Department Store.
Department stores have advanced for
tunately in both tbe quality of the goods
sold and the amount of tbe sales. The
business of several amounts annually to
from $7,500,000 to $15,000,000, and thi?,
roughly speaking, is as much money as
many a prosperous railway 1000 miles
long bandies in a twelvemonth; one great
store in the West carries a rent account of
almost, if not quite, $400,000 a year; a
number of houses send to the homes of
tbeir customers more than 20,000 packages
in a single day, while perhaps as many
more are carred away in the hands of the
shoppers. In the busiest days quite
100,000 persons have visited each of the
very largest stores of New York, Phila
delphia, Chicago and Brooklyn. One firm
spends more than $300,000 a year for ad
vertisine, and single departments in sev
eral stores sell more than $2,000,000 worth
of goods annually. â From "The Conduct
of G r eat Businesses â The Department

FROM GREATER NEW YORK
Budget of Interesting flevJs and Qossip
/\bout the California Colony in the
Eastern Metropolis
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 29.â This
meager budget shall not be filled up with
snow and jingling sleigh bells. Every
body in the land knows that all the East
ern and New England States had a white
robed Christmas day and that even the
antique city of New Orleans was treated
to about eight inches of the featnery
Hakes. Suffice to say. the sun shone so
briehtly that the whole world looked like
a big, beautiful Christmas card spnnklerf
with diamond dust, so whito and glitter
ing was the snow as the children on sleds
and the big folks oi> sleighs and droshkies
skimmed over it.
Hon. Grove L. Johnson and wife of Sac
ramento have been in town some ten days,
shopping and enjoying the holiday sights
in New York. They will proceed to
Washington shortly after the New Year.
It is becoming quite the Western fad
lately to sample the hospitality and ac
commodation of Gotham's different hotels
durinp a short visit here. Hon. Grove L.
Johnson and wife have been enjoying con
stant change since their arrival. They
first registered at the Waldorf, remained
there a couple of days anil then drova
around to the Imperial. They were cosily
installed therein, but the desire for new
surroundings was strong, so down to the
Gilsey they went, ban and baggage. The
following evening found them at the
Marlbornugb, where they think they will
remain until they go down to Washing
ton. Miss H. E. O'Neal accompanies
them.
Miss Mamie Polhemus arrived on Mon
day from San Fiancisco, and will visit
friends here.
Isn't it a heart-warming sight to wit
ness the meeting of two old-time
friends after they have been separated tor
many years? There occurred one of those
robust greetings the other evening when
Clarence Hellen and William S. Gage met
for tfce first time in many months. Mr.
Hellen and Mr. Gage were for years con
nected with the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company. Mr. Hellen has been here sev
eral months, and Mr. Gage arrived last
Tuesday direct from Nicaragua, Central
America, where he has been engaged in
mining ventures, which have proven most
profitable. His handsome young wife was
here to greet him, and after a visit of
about two months he will return to Cen
tral America. Mm. Gage may take the
journey with him.
Another San Franciscan, who still re
tains his offices in your City, but who has
transferred his energies to the compara
tively new fields of Central America, is
Alejandro Davis. He is interested with
coffee planting and mines in Salvador. At
present he is here on hii way to London
and Paris, where he will combine business
and pleasure. His stay will be about two
months abroad.
G. W. and Mrs. Stolph of San Francisco
arrived in time to have a "white" Christ
mas in Now York.
W. F. Goad Jr. is frequently seen at the
theaters and on the avenue. The visiting
Californians are taking advantage of the
good sleighing and aie enthusiastic over
the chilly sport. I met a man the other
day who doesn't enjoy it a bit. He says
he would rather sit in a warm room with
bis feet in ice-water and jingle the sleigh
bells himself than co out in the crisp,
biting r,ir, tucked under a mountain of
buffalo and bear hides, and hear the jolly
crunch of the sleigh-runners.
Captain Colan Augur of the Second
Cavalry, who was stationed at the Presidio
for several years, has been a guest at the
Grand Hotel during the past ten days.
Miss Blanche McClelland arrived direct
from San Francisco on Christmas day.
W. L. H. Noble is at the Marlborough.
Miss Paysou Graham, acnarming yonng
lady and one who is well known in Los
Angeles and San Francisco, has been re
cently engaged by Dave Hay man for Dan
iel Frohman's road company of the "Pris
oner of Zenda." Miss Graham has studied
very bard during the past year, and her
many friends in California will be happy
to know of the recognition her genuine
talents have received.
Sydney B. Palmer, the late advertising
representative of several Western newspa
pers, has closed his New York offi es and
taken permanent, residence in Toronto,
Canada. Mr. Palmer is a Canadian and
he insists that the climate of his birth
place and tue friends of his youth are de
lightful adjuncts to this workaday life.
Mrs. Palmer and their pretiy little
daughter joined him last week in Toronto.
Dr. L M Lomax of Stockton has had
a most unfortunate visit in the East. A
couple ot months ago she left her large
practice in Stockton to take a well-earned
rest in this city and attend a course of
scientific lectures at the New York Medi
cal College during her visit.
Almost immediately after her arrival
â be was taken seriously ill, and has but re
cently recovered sufficiently to prepare for
tier trm homeward. She expects to be
ready to leave for her home in Stockton
next Wednesday.
During the last two weeks the school
teachers have been having their own time
with tue children of the public schools,
because most of the bold ones have been
playing old-fashioned "hookey," and the
parents, on being informed or their ab
sence, have written excuses such as this:
Dear Teacher: If Louts Is bad please Hck him
till bis eyes eet blue. He has a great deal
of the mule in himâ be takes after his father.
Mrs. Powell.
P. a Please soak him in school just as often
as you have got lime.
Here is another, which carries a bit of
pathos with it:
Teacher: Please excuse Henny for not comin' I
to school, as be died from the car run over on
Tuesday. Frnnkie has be sick from the amou.a
ana information of the vowels, to oblige bis

Herrmann Left Little.
The Jvlagician J4ade $50,000 a year

Conservative estimates place Professor
Alexander Herrmann's net earnings in
the last twelve years at $600,000, and yet
he died without leavins a dollar. His
tours were always profitable, says the
New York Herald, and although his per

have accumulated a fortune if it had not
been for his unfortunate speculations.
He could make golden eagles sprout

disappear with equal facility in his private
li c.
There are few men who are ab!e to
make as much money as Herrmann did
in an ordinarily good season. He would
leave the United States for six months,
live as lew princes could afford to do, and
return with from $75,000 to $100,000 in
gold. During the last few years a judg
ment against him was worthless, as he
owned no tangible property and he was
swamped with debts.
He died in a private palace car for
which he had agreed to pay Mrs. Langtry
$12,500. He always carried from five to
eight beautiful horses with him, at an ex
pense of probably $300 to $500 a week.
When friend 3 remonstrated with him on
tins subject he would smile and remark
between puff* of a cigarette:
"They pay for themselves in advertis
ing. They are noticed everywhere, and
talk makes business."
Nobody was a greater advocate of ad
vertising than he. Every chance that cf
fered to get a line in the newspapers he
eagerly seized, and stories about his mys
tification of strangers with his tricks were
spread far and wide. He was willing to
devote his time and to spend money on
anything that would result in an adver
tisement.
His private railroad car co;t him abont
$500 a week, and he often had wilh him in
addition a private horsecar, with which he
astonished the natives of the smaller
cities. His own hotel bills averaged eas
ily $150 a week, in addition to his great
personal expenses. He kept up an elab
orate establishment in Whitestone, liong
Island, where he delighted to entertain
his friends. He took great pleasure in the
yacht Fra Diavolo last summer, and had
many charming parties with him up to
the time he started "on the road" for 1m
reason's work. He had bought the yacht
from Â£. S. Stokes, paying a small sum in
cash and giving notes indorsed by his wife
for the balance. As these notes were not
met on maturity be returned the yacht to
the orignal owner.
Professor Herrmann returned from a
European trip fifteen years ago so poor
that he had to raise money on his wile's
jewelry. He soon afterward started for a
tour of Mexico, tne West Indies and Sooth
Americ:), and on his next appearance here
his capacious pockets wera lined with
money. An era of disastrous specula
tions followed. He went into several ven
tures wi:h Richard S. Newcombe and lost
at least $50,000. Then he leased from
James Dickson the Broad-street Theater
in Philadelphia for thirty weeks, at a
rental of $1000 a week. He lost just about
the amount of his rent each week, until
he asked George W. Lederer to relieve him
ot the burden, and Mr. Lederer disposed
of the lease to Nixon & Zimmerman for
$10,000 in cash.
He made $200,000 in two years through
bis own work and his partnership with
Mr. Lederer in '"The Transatlantiques," a
vaudeville company, and "U. & 1.," with
Gas Williams and John D. Kelly as stars.
Thi3 money quickiy slipped through his
lingers. He remodeled the theater now
known as the Savoy, at a cost of $50,000,
and sank $25,000 in conducting it for a sea
son. He arranged to build a theater in
Brooklyn, through which he expected to
reap great profits, but after he had spent
$20,000 the place was condemned by thÂ«
Building Department and he could not
carry the scheme to a successful issue.
He was passionately fond of the excite
ment of dabbling in stocks, and a large
proportion of nis earnings eventually went
to brokers. He liked to go to Wall street
and to entertain the exchange by his
tricks, bat it was costly fun.

New Yorkers have not yet achieved the

At a recent meeting cf woman suffra

The Russians arp said to have exported
In 1895 over $10,000,000 worth of egcs, and

One of the notable developments of the
commerce of last year was the increase in
the foreign trade of Galveston. It has be
come a formidable competitor even to
such cities as New York and Chicago and
is handling large amounts of Western ex
ports and imports which were formerly
shipped through those cities.
By way of getting even with the top
lofty critics of New York and Chicago,
who have been sneering at them as hay
seeds and Populists, the people o. Kansas
are talking of sending a trainload of pro
visions to feed the starving poor of those
cities. Such a revenge would be worthy
of the mighty West.
It seems to be decided that the McKin
ley administration will not hold the
money question in abeyance until the
tariff issue is settled, but will begin at
once making preparations for an inter
national conference. Thus the work will
be advanced as rapidly as possib'e and the
people will have assurance that every
pledge made in the campaign by the Re
publican party will be kept to the letter.
Tie Department of Charities in New
York has reported to the city government
that the number of paupers at the Alms
bouse has increased so rapidly during the
past year that the appropriation is not
sufficient to maintain them. The increase
is said to amount to as much as 25 per
cent, and some kind of city extension will
be necessary to enable New YorK to keep
her self-supporting population on even
terms with her paupers.
OUB WINTER SPOETS.
The celebration of New Y r ear's day by the
Burlingame Club with a aeries of open-air
sports strikingly illustrates the advantages
of the California climate for all seekers of
midwinter pleasure. The Burlinganie
Club was not the only assembly of men
and women who enjoyed the festival of
the opening year out of doors, but as from
its wealth it has more prestige than others,
it will be more widely noticed and there
fore serves best as an advertisement of
the geniality of our climate.
The dweller in San Francisco could taie
his choice on New Year's eve of almost
any form of New Year's day celebration
he desired. He could by a night's ride on
the train have transported himself to the
mountains, where, amid snow and ice, he
could have disported himself with skat
ing or sleigh-riding to his heart's content.
Had ho chosen he might have gone to
districts where orange groves are bending
beneath the weight of golden fruit and
where gardens are bright with the bloom
of a thousand flowers. If the fancy took
him he could go aboard a yacht and sail
over seas as lucent as any ibat ever spread
in the Mediterranean when the summer
sun was brightest
Even if he determined to remain within
the confines of the City, he would have
found a variety of enjoyment greater than
most countries could afford him even
within the widest extent of their domin
ion. Here he could enjoy the bustle and
excitement of the City, the grandeur of
the ocean stretching away from the cliff?
that are crowned with the beautiful Sutro
Gardens, or ascend the hijher hills and
peaks of the peninsula ana have therein
all the exercise of mountain climbing.
Xo other area of extent similar to our
State afforded such a variety of sport and
enjoyment for the day anri no other city
in this State equaled San Franci-co.
In the past California was famous as the
land of gold, to-day it is chiefly renowned
as the region of fruits and flowers; butUie
time is not far distant when it will be
known through all the world as the land
of winter sports. We have already begun
a series of winter festivals varying from
the ice palaces of Truckee to the rose fetes
of Santa Barbara, which have attracted to
us thousands of tourists and been the de
light of pleasure-seekers from all parts of
the world.
These festivals are only in their infancy.
They improve with each succeeding year,
and grow irom more to more until in the
course of time they will become world
famous. Then will the full charm of Cali
fornia be made known, and among all en
lightened people it will be recognized as
that portion of earth which is most con
genial to man and serves best for the
development of every faculty within him.
It is beyond dispute tint humanity at
tains its highest levels in countries where
men and women can live most in the open
air. It was the congeniality of climate
which enabled the old Greeks to advance
in the ancient world, and made their
â 'halcyon days" as well as their geniu3 a
proverb even to our time. California can
rightly expect to become to the world of
to-day what Greece was of old, and in so
becoming will owe as much to tiie gifts of
her ciimate as to any other advantage
which nature or man has bestowed upon
her.
LOANS TOR SMALL CEEDITOES.
According to the London Chronicle the
creat increase cl capital in recent times in
England instead of facilitating the neeo
.ia ion of loans for general business has
made it well nigh impossible for the men
engaged in small enterprises to borrow at
all. They are charged high rates of inter
e.-t or refused credit, while the rich man
can get all he wants for next to nothing.
As the Chronicle says: "The great specu
lator never had suc'.i chances of sweeping
the board. But things are undeniably
har.i for many sninll men and for the
more quiet-going, o ct-fashioned business
houses which may chance to find them
selves in a tijrht corner."
The reason given for this condition
of affairs is that the small bank
has practically been swallowed by the
mammoth joint stock company. "The
dealers in credit are big people,
with ripid rules, and they will not
unl end as they used to do." The conse
quence is that if the small trader stays in
business he must be financed by his
wholesale house, and this changed system
playa a powerful part in the building up
of immense fortunes.
In the matter of remedies the Chronicle
says it is not surprising "we hear so much
of schemes for the establishment cf agri
cultural credit banks." It seems, more
over, that the question of applying insur
ance to credit is coming up for discussion.
It is thought that if the great banks can
not spare the tirce to go into the circum
stances ana prospects of their smaller cus
tomers or run the risk of tiding them over
difficulties there is a good opportunity for
the organization of miarantee companies
which would make careful inquiries and
furnish the borrower with a credit policy,
Dy virtue of w ich he could make his pur
chase or tide over an emercency.
In our country similar difficulties in the
way of enterprising men of small capital
a c rapidly increasing. Here also the
growth of large banks gives opportunities
for overgrown fortunes to grow still fur
ther at the expense of the mass of men of
smaller means to the menace of industrial
liberty end general prosperity. This fact
will be a prominent leature in the coming
discussion of reform in our batikine laws,
and it would be winning policy to make
a leading part of this reform the es
tablishment of banks which would grant
small loans at reasonable interest to per
sons of good character, business ability
and bright prospects.
There can be little question that in the
Eastern States the conditions of banking
are much more like those in Englana than
with us. Large quantities of money are
concentrated in the great banking centers
of New York and Boston, while the agri
cultural States have hardly money enough
to'conduct their business. Whether any
thing can be gained by the establishment
of agricultural credit banks or credit, in
surance companies may be doubtful, but
we a^ree with our London contemporary
that "an experiment on these lines would
at least be interesting and it might help
to break down the barrier which exists at
present between the would-be borrower
and the bank."
INVENTION AND BUSINESS.
No sadder sight is presented to the con
templation of the intelligence of the age
than is that of the grave of unrewarded
inventive genius. With the demand of
the world for anything and everything
that may add to its convsniences and
comforts, it is very much in evidence ihat
not more than one out of a tboQsacd in
ventors reap pecuniary benefit from tbeir
labors. The other 999 either live to see the
fruits of their study and toil enjoyed with
out themselves participating in the feast, or
else die without disclosing the secret of
their discoveries.
There are many dusty garrets into
which are gathered the rubbish of curious
mechanisms which co3t the besl thoughts
and the best years of men now worn gray,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 3, 1897.
which but serve to mark the cold selfish
ness of the world, that emphasizes itself
in the poverty stricken evening of the in
ventor. And yet among such "rubbish"
have been fcjund, too late to benefit the
starved genius of its conception, some of
the greatest inventions that hnve blessed
mankind.
America enjoys the repute of producing
a greater percentage of practical inventors
than any other nation, and the patent
laws of the United States are often cited
as a Nation's pride. It is questionable,
however, if the system is a perfect one.
Some proper protection should undoubt
edly be given to the inventor, but whether
or not this class of genius is best con
served and its reward best secured by
the existing system is a question. It
would appear that present codes of patent
law may, by skillful interpretation, be
distorted into a means whereby great cap
ital may ally itself with legal shrewdness
to exact tribute from the masses for the
use of almost every piece of mechanism
known to man. Colossal fortunes are
thus aggregated, enormous revenues are
reaped, but in the distribution of the
golden harvest the poor inventor is too
frequently only a gleaner.
The birth of an inventive idea is often
only the beginning of trouble. To clothe
the creation in presentable raiment re
quires large expenditure of money. Not
one in a hundred thousand inventions
finds its acceptance by the users in ex
actly the original form. It must be
adapted to the demands and requirements
of the times. Very rarely are found the
inventive faculty and business ability
domiciled in the same person. As a rule
the natural inventor is the worst business
man possible. If it happens that the un
businesslike inventor falls in with the
really honest business man who recog
nizes the fact that the inventor is the
"creator" of the fortune, without whose
genius the harvest were impossible, then
â  t is well; but experience records a saader
history. If the impecunious genius ap
proaches the moneyed man for aid in the
development of his invention he is too
often met with the demand that for the
paltry sum required he shall convey to
the promoter the great bulk of the right
to enjoy the value of the discovery, and so
the fruit of his toil enriched all but its
producer.
If some arrangement could be made
wnereby public aid might, under proper
regulations, be judiciously extended to
needy inventors in cnses where the germ
of the invention promised to be practical,
the aid so given to be repaid in making
the perfected machine available to public
use without the exaction of extravagant
royalties, the world would assuredly be
come ricuer in many desirable things, in
vention would be 'stimulated and this
without unjust taxation. The opportu
nity for gisantic aggregation of wealth to
control the necessary machines of trade
and industry would not obtain, but both
the inventor and the public would share
the benefits.
WOLCOTT'S MISSION.
Senator Wolcott in an interview pub
lished in The Call yesterday stated
that he is going to Europe for the
purpose of conferring with the lead
ers of European bimetallists in oraer
to prepare the way for an inter
national conference on the subject of ttie
free coinage of siiver. He express d him
self as being hopeful of good results, and
in every word uttered gave evidence of a
sanguine feeling that much will be accom
plished in a time much shorter tban many
people have supposed.
In discussing the authority underwhich
he would act Senator Wolcott said:
I am going to Europe with the full knowl
edge and consent of Major McKinley. It is
not true that I am commissioned to uct as the
reti't'sentative (f the administration. The
only outhority I acknowledge is derived from
the Republican Senatorial caucus committee,
whose envoy I am. The Republican Senators
who desire to keep the promises made in the
St. Louis platform want to know first what
thu feeling is abroaS wilh regard to interna
tional bimetallism, and they have requested
me to find out and report to them.
The statement of the Senator renders it
certain that the administration will co
operate with Republican Senators in pro
moting an international monetary con
ference and will do all within its power to
brine that conference to some important
conclusion. An assurance is thus given
that the monpy question will not be held
in abeyance until after the tariff question
is settled, but will be taken up at once as
soon as the new administration comes
into office, and that every effort will be
made to solve it by a return to bimetal
lism under conditions which will be preju
diral to no interest of the country.
It is reported that the committee ap
pomled to draft a measure providing for
tne call of an international conference
will submit a bill differing from the one
adopted by the Fifty-third Congress, in
asmuch as it wili leave the selection of
the American conferees entirely Jo the
President. This can be safely done since
it is known that McKinley is favorable to
bimetallism, which Cleveland was not.
Such a bill will probably be as acceptable
to the House as to the Senate, and will be
one of the measures which will be taken
up as soon as a new Congress is called to
gether.
It is reported that Senator Hoar, who is
a member of the committee, has given the
other members much valuable informa
tion which he collected while in Europe
last summer. He has told them that
France is aggressively in favor of the free
coinage of silver, that public sentiment in
Germany tends strongiy in the same di
rection, and that even in England there is
a willingness to enter upon a reconsidera
tion of the question. Senator Wolcott
goes to Europe to receive a confirmation
of these reports and to make arrange
ments for an exercise of the full strength
of the bimetalhsts in the coming confer
ence. His mission therefore is one of the
utmost importance and will be watched
with interest by ail classes of our people.

WATCHING OUT THE OLD YEA V R

Call ah an
Sent a big "Invite" to Dan

He was told to keep It mum
And be dumb:
But Daniel's long, unru y tonga*
Became unstrung,
And he passed the word around
Till It found
Donovan.
Soon It pot to Jerry Ryan,
Then O'Brien,

Till the tale
Grew in volume from a tadpole to a whale.
Then the news
Flew around to Ned McHughet;
Then the Nolans <

Took their turns -
At the storyâ so did Burns;
Then McGrane
Got the matter to Ills brain ;
Soon the Flynos
And McGlynns
And ttie cobbler, McElroy,
Heard the yarn and howled with Joy:
Then the Regans,
And ihe Kecgans,
And the K.ilys, Kennys, Careys,
All the Gallaghers and Gearys
And the hundreds of the others
'With their cousins and their brothers

When day had taken flight
And the night
Had gloomed the wintry street,
Bold O'Connor on his beat
Saw beneath the gleam
Of the corner lamps a streamâ
A coumless, noiseless throng,
Fi i â¢ tms: specter-like alone,
In and out across the ray
And then fading quite away,
(As the graveyard creatures do)
From his view.
Then each particular hair
Of O'Connor rose In air.
In his face
He j. uimed his whistle, but no mte'
From its throat
Broke the silence of the place.
He tried to yell
But a sp?H
Buckled down npon his scul.
Black disaster seemed to roll
Near and near.
He henrd the banshee wall
On the bleak December gale,
And saw the hosts
Of a pallid squad of ghosts
Appear and disappear.
Callahan behind the bar
Saw his front door spring a]ar t
And Dan
Floating in with Donovan.
Then came Ryan
And O'Brien,
Then McGlory,
Who had caught the whispered story.
Then McHughes
Whose
Tonsue hod swelled the tale
From a tadpole to a whale.
Then the Nolans
A nd the Dolans.
The Murpbys and then Burns,
Who In turns
Had tilled the lad McGrane
With the mattt-r till his brain

Letters From the People.
PER CAPITA TAXATION.
A Proposition That It I* AsÂ»erte& Would
Jtendnr Tnxea Uniform.
To the Editor of the San Francisco CallâSxv.:
The alarming tendency to increase taxation
and thus add to the burdens already too heavy
is apparent in every direction. The taxpayer,
with scanty purse, looks on with horror, and
tearful for the future asks, "When will tiiis
legal robbery cease ?' The answer comes in
the shape of an appropriation for more public
buildings ana an additional stair of well-paid
officials; more places for favorites, increase in
the salaries of officers who have always been
too liberally paid for the times even when the
country was in the height of its prosperity.
The entire State is being covered with public
institutions, conducted by a corp3 of high
salaried employes. The City of San Francisco,
not to be outdone in this reckless policy to
freely spend the money of others, is likewise
making every endeavor to increase the num
ber of its- municipal buildings, as well as the
sultines of the political hirelings upon whom
their management depends. Tne whole scale
ofwaues is far in excess of that paid to the
best skilled labor in the land, and, when cou
pled with the duties required and the steady
employment of thu incumbent", it is not sur
prising that protests should be heard from
those who are fortunate if they should be em
ployed even two-thirds of the time at a lesser
rate.
There is not a department in either the State
or City Government that could not be conducted
lor at least 30 per cent less money. The office
holders wiu invariably tell you that they* are
hard worked and poorly paid, and as each
year rolls around they demand still larger ap
propriations together with an increase in the
working force. Toe legislators the people
elect are ever ready to prove false to their
trust and to respond freely to the demands of
the tax-eater. There is no pretension to any
thing like business management; in fact it is
only a question of how much will the tax
pnyers stand without a revolution.
The government of this City, with its un
blushing greed, regularly adas to the burden
oi the taxpayer by creating fat places for po
litical favorites, appropriating moneys for un
necessary buildings and squandering the peo
ple's funds without any consideration of the
ability of the property-holder to contribute to
these extravagances. To partially cure these
evils the writer begs leave to offer the follow
ing suegestlons:
First, that taxation should be levied accord
ing to the population, as shown by the Federal
census.
Second, that a per capita tax of $ 3 (maxi
mum) should be levied iv. each county for
Stale i>urpo-;es only.
Third, that each County Treasurer should
pay into the State treasury a maximum sum
of $3 for each inhabitant in said county,
which sum should be In full for each county's
proportion for the support of the State Govern
ment. No greater amount than $3 pc; capita
should be collected in any year.
Fourth, for county or city purposes, taxes
should be levied in the same manner, that is,
a per capita tax of a maximum amount, which
amount should be levied an the property in
the county, and be in addition to the sum
levied for State purposes.
Fifth, for this city government the maxi
mum amount of taxes levied should not ex
ceed $10 for each inhabitant, and .at every
Federal census taxes should be regulated so
that they would not exceed the amount of $3
per cap.ta for State use, and $10 per capita for
the government of the city find county.
By this method each county wou.d know
just what they would be Called upon to pay
into the State treasury each year, and every
taxp'yer would be assured of a uniform rate
oi taxation, thereby abolishing the absurd and
unjust method now in vogue. Under this plan
thu rate of taxation would bo as follows on
the ljasis of 300,000 population :
For State purposes, at *3 per capita $900,000
For City and County purposes, at $10
per capita 3,000.00f)
For fines anil licenses, say 500,01)0
Total 84, 4 00, 000
This amount would therefore represent a
sum sufficiently large to support a much
larger city than Sun Francisco.
Under this method of per capita taxation
each county and each city and town in the 1
several counties would be compelled to estab
lish a ratio or per capita tax mat would be
sufficient. to pay the expenses of th? various
governments, and which ratio could not be
chatigi-d until the next Federal census an
nounced th" population of the various coun- '
ties and their towns. There would be no occa- I
sion for Uie maintenance of Â»v Stale Board of
Equalization that never did equalize, and the
taxpayer would have the satisiaction of know
ing that his raxes would De uniform, and that
a limit had been placed upon the grab game
of the tax-eater. A. M. Speck.

It Is queer, but it is a fact, that a man's
name is not bis own to sell or swap for another
as he may choose. This is an idiosyncrasy of
the law that is, like s>o many oih> r laws, past
finding out. But the law says it is a crime to
shift one's cogiomen, and two meu in an East
ern" town who obtained employment under
different titles from those which came to them
from their parents were fined $20 eHCh in a
ciiy police court the other day. It is r>oÂ«sitile
that a man mey be arrested some day for
chnnging his hair or shaving off his mustache
without an act of the Legislature.

S learn the other day that Yictorien j
S Sardou was a spiritualist, is even
more surprised now at the news that Vic
tor Hu^o was also to a great extent a be
liever in spiritualism. In Hujro's "Jour
". nal of My Exile," which has not yet been
â¢â ' published, there are several passnges beai
ing on this point, says the New York
Herald. Some of these, edited by the
poet's daughter, Mlie. A'lele Hugo, have ]
been read by some o: his friends, and area
convincing proof to them of his belief in i
cccult powers.
Here follow the most notable passages,
as written by Mile, Hugo: j
"March 23, 1854. â Jersey is an island full
of legends. IV ere is not a rock, not an
old ruin, which is not BdDpOSttd to be
haunted. Some persons pretend that the
" devil has appeared to them, and they
show with horror the footprints of this
eternal antagonist of the human race;
others, more fortunate, are confident that
they have seen the Virpin, and they
piously point out the peak of the reck
where the mother of Christ appeared 10
them.
"One night about three months ago a
young workingman was Â£oinc toward the j
Church Sainte-Sue. Euldenly he saw at !
the end of the road a wtite and motion
less t'.gure. It seemed, indeed, one mass
of white flame. The workingman stopped !
a moment terrified. Then making a vio
lent effort he dashed ahead and so got past
the flaming white specter.
"This apparition appeared several times
afterward and finally became known as I
the White Lady. The first time my father
heard ot the workingman's adventure he
smiled. Yet, strange to say, he began to
hear strange sounds in his bedroom every
nieht At one time his papers would
rustle, though there was no wind; at an
other time some one would be heard
' knocking at his wall. My brothers, who j
slept in the adjoining rooms, heard the
E^rne noses.
"Other things equally strange also hap
pened. On the evening when Tapeur, the
Incendiary, died my mother after locking
her bedroom door went to bed, lorgetting
to blow out the light. The night was very
calm and there was not the least breath
of air. Yet when my mother awoke the
room was dark. The candle though not
consumed had been extinguished. By
. whom?.
"On February 22 my father came home
at 11 p. m., and as he passed through the
â  . room lacing the street he noticed that the
windows were quite dark. Yet, when my
brothers came home at 2 r. m. the windows
were ablaze with light. Yesterday even
ing Charles was amusing himself by try
ing to make a table talk. First he said to !
the spirit who was present:
" 'What is your name?'
"The spirit, or ghost, replied that its
name was the White Lady, and that it
â¢could not talk to any one except in the
street and at 3a. m. My fat her came in just j
then, and, being informed of the hour j
fixed for the interview, he concluded that
he would be more comfortable in bed than
chatting with a ghost in a desertea street
at that hour in the morning. We all de- !
cided to do the same, and we went to bed
and were soon all sleeping soundly, ex
cept my father, who was working in bed, I
as was his occasional custom. Suddenly |
he heard a bell ring loudly, and at once .
he remembered the White Lady and the
rendezvous.
"He lit his candle and looked at his
watch. It was exactly 3 o'clock. Would
the White Lady be on time? At the
thought a horror seized my father, and he
dared not leave his bed. Weak souls be
lieve blindly in mystery, strong souls
deny it, great souls become very grave
when confronting the unknown. They
have a sacred horror of it, as my father
had, and they say with Hamlet, 'There
are more things in heaven ana earth, Ho
ratio, than are dreamed ol in your phi
losophy.'
"In the future state," said Victor Hugo,
on another occasion, "tne full meaning of
â¢liberty will be maUe clear. The laws reg
ulating it will be revealed, and men will
then be free to do what they please and at
. their own risk. So much the worse for
those' who commit suicnle and thus fling
themselves into a fire which they surely
Know will consume them.
"Excess of grief may be an excuse for
suicide, but it cannot serve as a plea for
absolulion. No person has a right to
shatter his fetters and go out of life, aban
doning the house which GoJ gave us when
he put us into this world. I believe that
' , . the crime of suicide will be punished in
another world. If, however, a man com
mits suicide under excessive provocation,
I believe that God will then make him
live again in this world, and under much
harder conditions than those from which
he hoped to set himself free."
â¢ . â¢In a letter written to Mme. Girardin, in
. 1855, Victor Huj;o says:
â¢ "Tables indeed tell us surprising things.
We are living in a mysterious horizon ; the
tables command us to keep silence and not
â¢to divulge any secret. You will find,
then, in the 'Contemplations' nothing
which comes from the tables, with the
exception of two details. They are very
important, and I have asked permission
tp use them."
Here aeain is a very curious note, writ
â¢ ten by the poet on the manuscript of the
"Legende dcs S'eclea" :
"I have taken part several times re
- cently in what is known as the phenom
enon of the antique tripod, a table with
â¢ :. three legs dictates verses by means of
raps, and strophes come forth nut of
'. , Bhadov/. I need hardiy say that I have
never piaced among my own poems any
of the verses that have come to me in this
. mysterious fashion; these latter I have
re.'igiously allowed to remain in posses
sion of the Great Unknown, who is their
sole author. I hava not even allowed
them to influence me in the slightest de
gree. The work of the human brain
ought to be entirely its own, receiving
no aid from such phenomena.
"The exterior manifestations of the in
visible are a fact, and the interior creations
of thought are another. The wall which
separates these two facts should" be main
tained in the interests of observation and
of science. No breach should be made in
it. By the side of science, which guards
it, staDds also religion, toe great, the true,
which forbids us to tamper with it, Ire
; peat, then, that I have isolated myself in
; this matter as much through my religious
conscience as through my literary con
science, and also through my reject for

my law to admit no such outside influence
into the sphere of my inspiration, and

Like Sardou Hugo believed that spirit
j ualism was a fitting subject for the stage.
. In 1833 he suggested to Autenor Jcly that
I it would be an admirable scheme to estab
i lish what he styled a "fantastic theater,"
i but unfortunately the plan was not carried
} ou:, "owing to the pigheadednefs of the
j directors. I: Phantoms, Hueto thought,
i might just as reasonably be called upon
to piay a part on the stago as human
beings, and he was fond of citing as a good
example the apparition of the commander
in Moliere's ''Don Juan."
'Ihenew3 that this groat poet believed
in the existence and influence of occult
. forces and was to a great extent a believer
in spiritualism, while it has caused much
surprise in France, has aiso given great
pleasure to the numerous French mystics
and anti-;uateriaii3'.s. "If Hugo and Sar
dou believe in spiritualism," say these
! latter, "it surely will not be hard to per
suade the multitude that spirits exi>t and
are a potent influence for good and evil."
COMPLETION OF A GREAT WORK.
THE PRINCIPLES OF SOCIOLOGY. Thirl
volume. By Herbert Spencer. D. Appletou A
Ca, XewYurK. I'rice $Â£ for sale by William
[ Doxey, Palace Hotel, City.
With the giviag to the public of this third
i volume of the "Principles of Sociology," Her
bert Spencer ends the great work of writing a
complete synthetic philosophy, which he be
gan thirty-sax years ago. The complete set of
the synthetic philosophy is printed in ten
volumes and is one of the greatest of literary
achievements. In addition to the continuous
work since 18C0 done by the phenomenally
i clear-besded and industrious author, the ten
large volumes represent the labors of a number
of able assistants, who aided in collecting the
necessary data and in verifying the statements
made In the books with elaborate care. The
"Principles of Sociology" alone involved the
reading of 500 works in order to get together
the necessary data. The work is not exactly
as planned and promised, but while some parts
have been omitted this philosophical library
has bsen made more complete in ways not
promised, and the author considers that the
promise of the prospectus has been fully re
deemed. The important part emitted was to
have treated of progressâ linguistic, intel
lectual, moral, esthetic. Hut these topics
were too extensive and complex for an invalid
j of TO to handle adequately.
The two first parts of this last volume, on ec
j clesiastical institutions and professional insti
tutions, have been published before, but the
third part on indus;rial institutions is here
j first given to the public. It discusses twenty- j
j four subjects in the author's usual clear, \
! authoritative way, and the facts gathered by i
! him are probably more accurate, comprehen- !
! sive and philosophically considered than the
student can find elsewhere in literature.
Among the opinions and conclusions of this
I great philosopher a few may be mentioned as j
j of special interest. He considers compound
' capital as a great factor of modern progress,
and saya that as a result of limited liability
companies stagnant capital has almost disap
peared. In the chapter on trades unionism
i he demonstrates huw the workman by these
j interferences with natural competition in
j evitably loses in one way what he makes in j
I another. He says the assumption is still domi
! nant among traJes union people that the
' manual workers do everything and the mental
workers nothing.
He gives the pros and cons of co-operation
I with remarkable fairness and lucidity, and in
j the conclusion of the whole matter shows
i that he is decidedly In favor of striving to
i overcome the difficulties in the way of making
! this fair ideal of general practicability. He
says: "The practicability of such a system de
â¢ pends on character, the best industrial insti
tutions are possible only with the best men.
: The requisite 'sweet reasonableness' is not yet
I sufficiently prevalent." The main difficulty
| in the way of co-operation he thinks is the
; getting of honest and skillful management. |
â  Though he believes in co-operation he is de
cidedly opposed to socialism. "At the same
. time that it is biologically fatal the d ctrine of
I the socialists is psychologically absurd. It
| implies an impossible mental structure." He
deems it useless to hope that se.fi'h men may
be so manipulated as to behave unselfishly.
THE GIRLS AND THE PRINCE.
When the Prince of Wales was in America in
1800 he was a young maa of 19 and un
married. Naturally, the American girls were
deepiy interested in him, and a period of the
i most romantic excitement ensued in all the
cities. Every subterfuge to dance -.nth. the
young Prince was resorted to, and members of
his party were bribed to arrange a waltz with
the heir apparent. The most unusual ex
pedients were resorted to by girls. His bag
gage was kissed as it was put aboard the cars,
and when he left a hotel room women would
rush in and carry away in bottles the water in
| which he had washed his face. Church people
forgot themselves and stood on the cushions of
the pews in order to see the royal visitor.
On every haiia it was a season of excitement,
and balls, dinners, fetes and receptions ruled-
One of the Prince's party was Stephen Fiske,
j who was delegated by the elder James Gordon
Bennett of the New York Herald to remain
with tho Prince while he was in America.
( Naturally Mr. Fiske saw ell the iucidentsof His
Highness 1 tour. Takinga lik ng to the Ameri
can journalist the young Prince saw that he was
present upon all occasions. Now Mr. Fiske
! has written out the whole story, and it will
i form the January installment of the La
â¢ dies' Home Journal's series of "Great Personal
I Events." Illustrations of some of the great
scenes have been made, and these will be
given with the article in the January Journal.

When Is a Woman Old ?
This query ou my window hung:
"When is a woman old?''
It clings to me, ana long has clungâ
The answer must be told 1
Ah, some are old before half-way,
Ana some are never oid ;
For these but lauxh life's cares away,
While those both fret and scold I
And yet it is no easy task,
However well controlled,
To answer one, if she should askâ
"When is a woman old?"
The young ones never ask you, sir,
The answer to unfold â
The r.ld ones only ask yon, sir,
"When is a woman old?"'
Conceited ones are never so â
Unhappy ones too soon ;
But wise ones love life's morning glow,
And prize its afternoon.
The graceful ones are still young,
And those alone are old
Who try to make themselves look young
When age has taken hold.
PICTURES OF A PASSING RACE
In the large and interesting volume just
publishel of the recollections of General Nel
son A. Miles, a short general review of which
wns given in these columns last week, there
are a number of good anecdotes, especially
about Indian warfars and illustrative of Indian
character, and there are a number of carefully
lormed opinions expressed, ell of which are of
unusual interest when we consider the emi
nence of the source from which they come.
Some brief selections from among these will
give the reader an idea of what a valuable and
entertaining book the general has written
about his personal experiences.
Prominent among the features which will be
noted with close attention is his studious un
raveling of the mystery of the famous Custer
fignt, from which no white man escaped to
make report. General Miles, from a careful
examination of the ground and of the army
orders and reports, together with collecting
the accounts of ihe Indians who were engnped
4n the conflict and analyzing and veriiying
these by comparing them with other evi
dences, has teen able to write a history of that
terrible disaster perhaps almost p.s accurate as
if Custer himself had come back from the dead
to tell of that fatal day of heroism and of cow
ardice. His testimony in favor of Custer both
as a man end an able commander is without a
wavering doubt, and his condemnation of
Kcuo, while wholly without the aid of vitu
perative adjectives, is like the scientific
ally planned attack of a capable mili
tary chieftainâ cool, terrible and deci
sive. "The distance across the valley
from the position first occupied by Reno,
where Custer undoubtedly expected him to re
main, and the position where Custer's com
mand fought is not more than two miles.
Rifle shots from one would cross the line of
fire lrom the other. In other words, an enemy
between the two commands would have been
under the fire of both. Had Reno remnined in
that position it would have enabled Ben teen
to 'cotoe on' and to 'be qu:ck,' as he had been
ordered and es he was doing. It would have
brought him into position and into action be
tween the two commands of Custer and Reno.
"When asked what would have been the re
sult if Reno had not retreated the Indians
frankly said that if he had not run they would

The oldest ones of all the old
Are those who would look young;
For they will always fret and scold,
When age's sign is hung.
The old in years who live among

Long after youth departs.
As long as women cling to youth.
And disregard their age,

consequences would have been if Reno with
the seven troops had followed the Uncpapas
and Ogalailas when they turned aria went
down to the assistance of the Indians in the
village, and they candidly admitted that they
would have been between two fires. In other
words, the battle wss lost twice, not by the ac
tion of Custer, however, for his command
fought gallantly as long as it lasted and he
had given proper and judicious orders to the
other lommands.
"It is not expected that five troops could
have whip) ed that body of Indians, neither is
it believed that that Dody of Indians could
have whipped twelve troop-* of the Seventh
Cavdlry. under Custer's commnnd, or if his or
ders had been promptly executed. The fact
that after Custer's five troops had been anni
hilated the Indians who came back and en
gaged the seven troops were repulsed, and
that they failed to dislodge the troops, Is
proof that the force was amply strong if it
had only acted in full concert. No command
ing officer can win victories with seven
twelfths of his command remaining out 01 the
engagement when within Found ol his rifle
shots. Grouchy did not come up to the 'sound
of the guns,' but Blucher did, aad the his
toric Waterloo was the result."
In his chapter about game in the great
West, General Miles relates an adventure of
Captain Frank D. Baldwin while hunting buf
falo. The ciiptaln wr.s mounted on an un
trained horse, which did not tinderstand
ouick dodging. Instantly after being shot the
chased buffno wheeled, placed his horns be
neath the flanks of the horse and threw both
him ana his rider clear over his head. The
horse was killed, but the captain only
stunned. Another adventure of Captain
Baldwin's was In being chased by wolves for
twenty miles. He escaped only by riding his
norse to death.
The general tells of his acquaintance with
the noted hunter, "Buffalo Bill," somewhat
less known as William F. Cody. "He was at
thnt time a young man in the twenties, tall,
stalwart and of magnificent physique, one of
the handsomest and most powerful men I have
ever known, with locks of a golden hue, large,
brilliant, dark eyes and perfect features. He
was a daring rider and amostexpertrlfleman.

kill more buffaloes during a single run than
any other man I have ever known. He not
only took the risks of a desperate chase, but
he and his party had to be constantly on the
lookout for Indians."
Speaking of the Sand Creek massacre, which
occurred in 18G4 under the personal direction
of J. M. Chivington, colonel of the First Colo
rado Cavalry, he says: "It scarcely has a par
allel in the records of Indian barbarity. Flee
ing women, holding up their hand and pray
ing for mercy, were shot down; infants were
killed and scalped in derision ; men were tor
tured and mutilated in a way that would put
to shame the savages of interior Africa. JCo
one will be astonished that a war ensued
wh ich cost the Government $30,000,000 and
carried conflagration and death into the bor
der settlement?." This is but a sample of the
many things General Miles tells us about
which make it clear to us that the terribie re
taliations of savages trained for generations to
believe that vengeance was a virtue were in
evitable.
One of the humorous things in the book is
the tale ol how that grim savage, Sitting Bull,
could enjoy a joke. When he came down to
the white settlements it was so uncertain
whether he was bent on peace or war that one
day the master of a trading-post where the old
chief w^s wont to dispose of his furs jokingly
handed the savage a red shirt and asked him
when he came to the settlements bent on mis
chief to please wear that red shirt as a sign.
Sitting Bull said that a good time to wear it
was right now, and he proceeded to put it on.
He then jumped over the counter and took
charge of the store in the most determined and
business-like way, to the terror of the trem
bling trader and his assistants, but to the
hilarious delight of the warriors who were
with the chief. Then he began to trade with
the Indians and in derision mimicked the
trader's methods of trying to overreach the
red men in shrewd bargaining. The tall
warriors seemed to have been in too sportive a
mood to commit murder, but they bartered
their furs at the store that day to much better
advantage than they had ever done before,
and displayed their enjoyment of the im
provised comedy in deep grunts of satisfaction.
For the most thrilling incident perhaps the
capture of Lame Deer, chief of the tribe of that
name, might be safely selected. The chief, in
tending to surrender, had dropped his rifle,
and General Miles rode up ana extended his
hand, which the Indian grasped in token of
friendship. An indiscreet white scout, desir
ing to be sure of the safety of the Generai,
rashly covered the quick and powerful warrior
with his rifie. The savage thought the inten
tion was to kill him, and quick as the thought,
he wrenched his hand from the clasp of amity,
ttirew his rifle to his shoulder and fired at
Miles. With equal swiftness the General jerked
his horse to oue side. The bullet killed a
soldier near by. The truce was at an end, and
Lame Deer and his followers were soon lying
dead on the prairie.
A fine description is Riven of a sham battle
which was fought by the wealthy and accom
plished Crows for the entertainment of Gen
eral Miles. "As they passed through the camp
:h? horses were careering and prancing, and
t&e men were shouting, singing war songs and
firing their rifles in the air. It was a wild and
picturesque scene, and as they passed in re
view before the head chief, Black Foot, and
myself, we were saluted with every mark of re
spect. In all my experience with Indians I
have never seen such a. display of decorations.
Tne'men were painted and ornamented with
the most brilliant feather-work. Their
easle head-dresses were waving in the
nir. Bear-claw necklaces hung about
the)r necks and scalp-lccks adorned
their spears. Their war jackets were
bespangled with glittering pieces of
flashing silver, elk teeth and mother of pearl,
and one of the singular features of the display
consisted in the fact that in the whole num
ber there were no two Indians decked alike.
Tliey did not copy or duplicate, and all their
work was of original design. The colors were
of the strongest and roo?t durable character.
Many of the war jackets could hardly have
been purchased at any price, each one being
the result of almost the work of a lifetime.
Going to the end of the camp they separated
into two large bod!eÂ«, which took positions
about a thousand yards apart and facing each
other. Then at a given signal from the chief
they dashed forward in sham-battle, giving
one of the most perfect portrayals of a real
combat I have ever witnessed. Discharging
their r.fles in the air with great rapidity, they
went through various evolutions of an Indian
batt'.e with wonderful rapidity and spirit."

Miles gives it as bis opinion that the best so

Though this work was written specially for
] for priests and ministers, the Cardinal hopes
that it "will be acceptable to students of civil
professions, to literary men and to a wide
circle of the general community." The dig
nity and responsibility of the Christian min
istry is the theme hei?e treated by this learned
j and widely respected dignitary of the Roman
Catholic church. The Archbishop observes in
his preface that "rabid bigotry is not a plant
that flourishes on Columbian soil. Those
ebullitions of unreasoning hatred toward
the Catholic church are not congenial to the
American character. They are generally
aroused and fomented by aliens as yÂ«t ill ac
quainted with our constitution, which guar
antees to all freedom of conscience."
Speaking of that class of citizens who, while
bearing no ill will to Catholics, yet sincerely
regard with dislike and suspicion that religion,
he says, "their animosity is no evidence of
their hostility to Catoolicdoctrines, but rather
to what they believe to be such."

This little story of a noble and most lovable
boy by an officer of the German army is pub
lished in the same volume with one called -A
West Point Parallel," by Captain Charles King
ot the United States army. The cleverness of
it is concealed by its seeming simplicity of
narration. We are made by the art of it to
love the brave and tender-hearted cadet, de
scribed as if he had really lived and fought
and suffered as the old oolonel in the story
tells about It. The book contains a lesson iv
true manliness that reminds one of the writ

THE JANUARY MAGAZINES.
The most striking article in the January
Scribner's will be the account of an eye
witness of the recent massacre In Constanti
nople. This will be the first detailed and
authentic account of this Turkish outrage to
appear In print. The author of the article
saw all that he describes as he passed through
the city on his way to business.
The new year begins for the children with
the appearance of the January St. Nicholas.
The number comes just at the holiday season
and so it contains much of the Christmas
spirit. It ODens with a story of Western fron
tier life, "Danny and 'The Major,' " by Ger
trude P. Greble. This is a tale of the adven
tures of a brave little seven-year-old boy, son
of an army captain, who rides through a band
ot hostile Indians all alone. "Hop Wing and
the Missing Treasure," by FranK. M. Bicknell,
is one of the tales from his "City of Stories,"
the present one drawing its inspiration from
the Flowery Kingdom. Tudor Jenks exdains
the phenomena of the mirage in a brief paper
ca'.led "Mirrors of Air." "Pins," by C. A.
Parker, aud "Cousin Anita's Surprise," by
Eleanor Root, are two little stories about two
[ little girls. Various interesting papers on
"Historic Dwarfs," by Mary Shears Roberts, will
be remembered as having appeared in this
magazine in past years. Another one is given
this month, devoted to Burto.de. He was a.
shrewd little Italian, who became prime min
ister to Alboiu, King of the Lombards. Gustav
iioDbe tells of "St. Paul's Rocks," a mountain
peak that appears above the surface of the
ocean in mid-Atlantic. "A Tender-Hearted
Monster," whose woes are Bet forth by Alice
Calhoun Halncs, was a dragon that could not
briug itself to devour princesses. Annie C.
Kuiper describes the peculiar observance of
"fct. Nicholas Day in Holland." Laurenc
Button's reminiscences of boyhood life in
New York nearly half a century ago tell of the
great social function of the boysâ paying New
Year's calls. The story of Shakespeare's time,
"Master Skylark," by John Bennett, iniroducos
the hero to thÂ« stage in the old city of Coven
try. The veracious Venetian traveler, in "The
True Story of Marco Polo," as set forth by Noah
Brooks, shows how the great Khan of Tarlary
went a-hunting. There are many poems, jin
gles and pictures in the number.
OnÂ© ol the first articles lr the January
sort by Hamlin Garland, entitled "A Girl of
Modern Tyre," and depicting life in a Western
town. It has striking pictures by Thulstrup.
The installment of Dr. S. Weir Miichell'sserinl,
"Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker," deals witii
Hugh's waywardness and the subsequent re
action toward a more serious and stable life.
General Horace Porter, in his "Campaigning
with Grant," continues his series of anecdotes,
incidents and descriptions of the movement
UDon Richmond in 1804. and there is a picture
by the late C. S. Rein hart of Grant's passage
to the left on the nieht of the third day in the
Wilderness. A paper richly illustrated by
Mr. Castaigne on "Public Spirit in Modern
Athens" is contriouted by D. Bikelas, as the
leading literary man of Greece. Mr. Cas
taigne's illustrations, which were made in
Athens especially for this ar'icle, take a^wide
range and deal with "Socrates in the Streets
of Athens," "The Pnvx," "The Acropolis at
Sunset," "The Academy" and other character

LITERARY NOTES.
Chester Bailey Fernald, whose first volume
of stories, "The Cat and the Cherub," has just
been cordially received, is shown in a new
vein in a story which will appear in the
January Century. This is "The Light of Sitkn,"
a tale of the sea with a tragic element. Mr.
Fernald was married a few months ago and has
recently gone to Japan, where he will remain
for a year or two in order to get local coloring
for a new Eeries of stories. He is best known
by his Chinese tales; and yet this is his first
trip to the Orient, as his studies of Chinese
characters were made during a residence in
Saa Francisco.
Stephen Crane, the author of "The Red
Badge of Courage," has written a vivid story
of border life, which the Century will priat.
Last summer George W. Smalley, the famous
correspondent and man of letters, went abroad
in the interests of the Ladies' Home Journal.
His commission was to write two articles, one,
on "The Personal Side of Bismarck" and the
other on "The Personal Side of the Prince
of Wales." Mr. Smalley personally knows both
men, and he had no difficulty in getting into
close touch with them, while other men would
have found insurmountable barriers. Tlio
first of these articles will be printed in the
January Issue of the Journal. Unpublished
portraits will illustrate the papers.
Outing lor January is the holiday number of
this best of sporting magazines. It is Dsauti
ful and entertaining, from the special cover to
the last of its seasonable pages.
In the January number of Harper's a paper
entitled "Science at the Beginning of the Cen.
tury," by Dr. Henry Smith Williams, will be an.
important contribution to the history of nine
teenth-century civilization, aud will be fol
lowed by other papers snowing the progress of
scientific discovery during the last hundred
years. These papers will be fully illustrated.
The Century is to have several articles on
"Heroes of Peace," beginning with one by
Theodore Roosevelt on "Heroism Among the
Poiice."
Articles in the January Forum include "The
Urgent Need of a National University at Wash
ington" by President David Starr Jordan of
the Leland Stanford Junior University; "The
Philosophy of Meliorism" by Junius Henri
Browne, and a timely paper by Professor R. C.
Ringwalt of Columbia University on "Inter
collegiate Debating"â its scope, mechanism
and valuable results.
In fiction the January issue of Godey's Maga
zine is especially strong. The opening serial
is"Elsbeth; the Story of a Little Gray Dove,"
by Carrie Hunt Latta, who tells the story of a
sweet little Quaker lass and her people, her
environment and her lover in a charming
style that wins the reader at once. "Elsbeth"
is a story which pictures life in bright hues,
even while It deals with much that is sad and
tragic. Its climax will not be given until Feb
ruary.
Lieutenant-General Schofield, lately peneral
in-chief of the army, and formerly Secretary
of War, has written several articles which will
soon appear in the Century, giving the inside
story of some famous events in American his
tory. The first is an account of Napoleon's
withdrawal from Mexico, with special refer
ence to the part taken by the United Stales
Government.
The handsomest calendar for 1897 which has
yet appeared is the one issued by Perry Mason
& Co., of Boston, publishers of the Youth's
Companion. The calendar is in the form of a
folder, 10}* by 24 inches in size, having four
leaves or panels, on each of which is the figure
of a beautiful maiden, lithographed in twelve
colors trom an original painting. The calen
dar will be an ornament to any home or any
business office. Perry Mason & Co. give it
free to all subscribers to the Companion who
send the subscription price ($1 75) of the pa
per for 1897.
The order of the King's Daughters and Sons
is described in an interesting and well-illus
trated article in Frank Leslie's Popular
Monthly for January. The auihÂ»r is Louise
Leyaiour Houghton, one of the leading spirits
in "the organization. It contains portraits of
the principal officers and many attractive
views.
Few people in these busy days are willing to
live without a calendar to mark the passing
of time. This fact, no doubt, accounts for the
calendars of all kinds, colons, shapes and sizes
which flood the mails at this season. Among
them all the one that best suits us is that
issued by N. W. Ayer & Son, the newspaper
advertising agents of Philadelphia. We havo
just received our neWcopy and are fixed for
1897. It is not difficult to see why this calen
dar is so great a favorite. Ths figures on it
are large enough to be read across a room; its
handsome appearance makes it worthy of a
place in the best-furnished office or library,
while it is business-like all the way through.
The publishers state that the demand for this
calendar has always exceeded the supply.
This led them years ago to plÂ«ce upon it a
nominal priceâ 2s cents, on receipt oi which
it is sent, postpaid and securely packed, to
any address.
A new long story by Anthony Hope is soon
to De published serially. It is of a social, io:
historical, character, and the bicycle rtga
forms one of its chief attractions.

The Reefer.
In Paris the reversible reefer is enjoying
a great vogue, being a smart as well as a
practical jacket. It is short, light in
weight, with a touch of color in the collar,
reverÂ» and hood. These jackets are in
dark blue, some with gray and while lin
ing?, some with red and black thecks; in
golden brown, with light fawn checks; in
dark green, with plaid lining. The neat
little strap shaping the waist and gold
buttons give an effective touch. They are
worn over black velvet or cloth skirts,
with a small toque, with a wing to match
the color of the hood, etc. East such cos
tumes will be much worn for skating, and
the gowns of fine black cloth, having per
fectly plain skirts with boleros composed
of a bright cloth, covered completely with
tine black silk braid, are most popular in
New York, as are also suits in dark green
and Bishop violet, with numberless rows
of black silk braid from the waist to the
hem of the skirt. The jackets have a
beautiful cut, which can only be given by
a first-class tailor.
Tartans are going to be most extensively
woro, one frock of a dark green plaid
being especially chic, and the lining of
such creations must always repeat the
color of one of the stripes. In the case of
the reeier suits the skirts are always lined
with a silk which rnatche3 the lining of the
hood, etc., and the black cloth skirts have
linings that are of the exact tone of the
boleros, and speaking of skirts reminds
me that baiayeuses are things oi the past,
as they have proved in many cases ex
ceedingly unsatisfactory. They are quite
superseded by a box pleating of satin rib
bon a couple of inches in wiath. What a
relief after our pinched out flouncings in
taffetas that were always siiaggiqg and
fraying.
Velvet Dresses.
These are owned oy every fashionable
woman and the latest are quite delightful,
but alarmingly expensive. The plain vel
vet skirt must be trimmed with innumer
able rows of silken braid, graduating from
the front half way up the oack, and either
:. secjacket treated in a similar fashion or
a bolero will complete such a skirt.
In ail cases the vest, or front, or shirt,
whichever form the underbodice may
take, is of some light soft stuff, such as
lisse, or lace, or both, and this is a good
idea, as the touch of light is becoming to
oil women; especially when the coat is
faced with some dark fur is the introduc
tion of the diaphanous of special use ana
beauty.
Gowns of Cpimson Cloth.
It is really a deplorable fact that many
women insist on choosing Dright cardinal
as the color for their costumes under the
impression that it is fashionable, when, in
reality, a dark shade of red is the dernier
cri in Paris, and this is charming either
when braided by hand to match, trimmed
with gray chinchilla or braided in black,
and then trimmed with black astrachan.
An English corresDondent thus speaks of
a tailor-made suit in this fashionable
ebade:
Another reason why I am very much in
iove witb dark red is the charm of a cos
tume with a skirt of face cloth, the front
seams braided with a flat braid about half
an inch wide, twisted in coils round the
base and narrow up toward the waist,
completed with a coat covered with lines
of braid, of the sac shape, but one inch be
low the waist. This has a Medici collar at
the back and facings of chinchilla, while
the sleeves are braided in straight lines,
and the hat, which completes it, is of dark
red felt, somewhat of the boot shape, with
the brim covered with a full pleating of
violet velvet, shaded violet and red roses
being beneath the brim at either side,
while over the crown waves a double
plume of black. It was an admirable
costume truly, and most admirably worn.
A young cirl in this City looks exceed
ingly well in a crimson camas hopsack
material, the skirt of which is trimmed
about the knees with three rows of black
ribbon velvet. The bolero is of the same
material, edged and braided with exceed
ingly narrow black velvet. The bolero fa
fastened from the bust to the waist with
small ornamental fastenings made of vel
vet. It is just short enough to show a
waistband of black velvet. The revers are
of black velvet, hemmed with astrachan.
A handsome visiting toilette is of one of
the newest repÂ«, dull red in tone, covered
with an overfigure of black brocade, the
velvet bodice being trimmed wiih galon
and pleated iisse.
Other excellent models are worthy of
our profound consideration, as many ideas
are suggested by them.
One there is in black, the coat faced
with ereen mcire silk in tucks, with a
htile frill of lace Bhowing at the top, and
a larpe collar of chinchilla. This is elab
orately braided in a somewhat novel de
sign, which extends down the seams in
the front of the skirt, while the skirt
which completes the costume is of green
moire set into groups of triple tucks, the
center box pleat beiag adorned with oxi
dised and diamond buttons, and outlined
on either side with a kilted frill, while at
the neck a black collar turns over a stock
made of green. A dark tray cloth coat
end skirt are in excellent taste, the coat
cut away in the front at the waist and
showing at the back a clo.-ely tabbed
basque. This has a chinchilla collar :.nd
a belt of white elaborately embroidered.
A dark blue dress exploits braids all over
the coat, which has a collar of black as
trachan, and is completed with a bodice
of the dirk blue cut in one with lone
epaulettes and overhanging a deep corse

Creations .Noted in Pans.
Mme. Legrand resides in Paris, but she
dresses with so much taste and originality
that now and then one of her toilettes is
described for our benefit. For example,
she recently wore a toilette consisting of
a light-gray cloth skirt, accordion pleated,
and round the foot ran a wide band of
braiding. The braid was not sewed on
evenly, being irregular at the edge; the
bodice matched and had an arrangement
in front of gray velvet, enhanced with
spangles. Over this was a collet of black
astrachan, embroidered with spangles

and cold ; above this a collar of guipure
and a high-standing collar, which was
filled in with a mass of cream lace round
the head. A black saifn bonnet, with pink
roses, gave the finishing touch, but from
the description madame must possess
certainly a swan-like neck, as it is difficult
to understand without seeing this creation
exactly the effect; however, it must be de
lightful, as was likewise one of dark blue
ribbed velvet, which has a plain skirt and
a blouse bodice, in the center of which
there is a fulling of pale blue crepe . plisse
drawn in, with a belt of dark tan leather,
studded with cabachons; over this was
worn a large cape of rich sable. The
wearer's bonnet has a red velvet crown
and is trimmed with black ostrich
. feathers; (i c muff of feathers and "velvet
exactly matches; pearl gray gloves were
worn. A fair countess when attired in
iron-gray velvet with a violet velvet
blouse, ornamented with bretelles, em
broidered with shaded silks and spangles
is said to be most picturesque. A cascade
of real lace extends down the front, and a
simply huge ruff composed of lace, velvet
and ribbon encircles her throat. With
this goes a huge-crowned hat of black
satin finished with a tersade of velvet and
plumes and tan kid gloves.
Worn by Great Jletresses.
All Paris is flocking to the Renaissance,
for Sarah Bern hard as Alfred de Musset's
Lorenzaccio, is attracting not only the
social world, but also celebrities from
among the great artists and the most
noted literary men of the day. Both cos
tume and scenery are very tine, and thus
far concerning Bernhardt's apparel I can
only report that she wore a black silk
embroidered'tunic, which had fu'l sleeves
of black sStin. Her breeches were short
and the long black cloak was suspended
from one shoulder. '"She was an ideal
Lorenzaccio; the deathly pallor of her face,
her short waveless hair, all helped ;to
make the portrait of that Florentine
Hamlet complete."
La Duso, I am glad to hear, has ordered
from Worth many of the elegant costumes
which she will wear soon in the different
plays in which she so soon expects to ap
pear. Some are thus described by a cor
respondent who has just paid Worth's es
tablishment a visit: There were three
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUM DAY, JANUARY 3, 1897.
dresses of crepe de chine, one white, the
skirt long and flowing, the bodice draped
across and drawn into a deep corselet of
gold lace, embroidered with raised gold,
long wide draped sieaves, the high neck
cut in a small square and bordered with
dull cold embroidery. The second, made
nearly the same, was silver cray, witn the
embroidery and raised work in silver; the
third was pate yellow, ornamented on the
bodice with drapery a l'antique of white
lace; the skirts all plain. For evening
dress, a pale yellow satin; on the left
side of the skirt was a quille of silver em
broidery, on which were placed narcissus
flowers of white crepe with diamond cen
ters, and the veins of the petals marked
with a silver thread. The low bodice was
ornamented with same design but smaller
placed in the rich lace that formed the
berthe and sleeves; the waistband was
folded satin, outlined with large dia
monds.
Another beautiful evening dress was
pale pink damas with a pattern
of laurel leaves entwined, and here and
th^re small wreaths embroidered in dia
monds, long skirt, low blouse bodice of
damas and lace, and the laurel leaves cut
out and appliques on the lace and stud
died with diamond?, a most skillful piece
of work.
The third is Ophelia green satin made
with trained skirt and two wide quilles
descending from the hips to the edge of
the skirt in a point. This beautiful em
broidery is composed of small spangles
and silver beads mingled with diamonds;
the top of the quille is surrounded with
white crepa like a cloud. The low bodice
is ornamented with crossed berthes of
embroidery, formine festoons round the
shoulders. A splendid evenins cloak is of
Genoa velvet, blue and mauve flowers on
a green satin cround; the sleeves are im
mense and looped up; the whole finished
with sable and rich lace.
i Even these few lines, written immedl-
ately after examining such delightful con
ceptions, abound in valuable idea and sug
gestions.
Naturally, the first nicht Snrah Bern
hardt presented "Lorenzaccio," the fair
dames in the audience were gor^ously
appareled. Any number of dresses were
composed of crepe de chine in various
light shades, such as in gray maize, helio
trope, etc., these three being for the mo
ment most liked for evening wenr. Almost
ail liad gauged sleeves puffed at the shoul
ders, and draped bodices over white lace
square empicements. Many of these so
called blouses worn were of velvet. Mmc,
Feydeau's bedice was especially admired,
being of a lettuce-green velvet, opening
over a chemisette of old guipure upon pale
blue satin. The collar was also of guipure
over satin, with pleated bluo satin rioboti
standing out from the throat in imitation
of the ancient ruffle.
Jte to Collars.
The greatest attention is being expended
upon collars. They are being made of n
piece of velvet cf some pale or bright
shade, according to ihe fancy or the color
ing of the wetrer, and measure a quarter
of a meter in width and nre cut en the
bias, the ends being irauged into the height
required at the back and fastened with
books and eyes. Then they are beaded all
over with either steel, shaped lite
small nail heads, or with ordinary seed
pearls. The ruff is attached irom the
sides, bo it leaves the throat bare. It is
ninde of fatiD ribbon or creamy white
chiffon, edged with Valenciennes lace,
which is Of the same tone. One of the Ja
orite colors employed in geranium pink
velvet, studded with pearls, with a ruff of
cliiffon.
These collars were got out by a
Parisian house to sell during the holidays
at $3 each, and were so popular that it
was found impossible to meet the preat
demand, as many were purchased as
Christmas gifts. So wo may expect to see
them here ere lonp, us our clever women
will soon be able, from this brief descrip
tion, to evolve some becoming ones. On
some of tue swellest jackets are seen
high chinchilla collars or the 1830 collar
in black velvet; but a woman i 3 made or
unmade by her collar, quite as much as a
man, so do, if you would be in the lea-t
in style, tee that your collar fits, sets and
suits you perfectly. ; , . â  Mahcella. â¢
Stales for Men.
The sweilest pocket-books this season
are made of pigskin, and if there is any
silver used about them it must be per
i fectly plain and solid, as I, am pleased to
say repousse work for such purposes is out
of date. If a monogram or crest is used it
must be engraved. -
An unusually good assortment of - socks,
gloves and ties is to be had at our leading
haberdashers. The dressing-gowns and
sraoking-jackets made of bright Scotch
plaid materials are liked.
Speaking of overcoats, rough cloths are
being much used for them, and melton is
not so well liked as beaver. Such a coat
is made moderately loose and has a velvet
collar. It shonld be single-breasted, and
the front must be a fly one. In length it
comes to just about two inches below the
knee. Only two outside pockets and a
small one additional for change, etc., are
considered necessary. There must not be
any flaps, and the pockets should be one
on each side of the garment, but not a
breast one. A coat of dark brown beaver
is declared to be more useful than a black
or blue one.
New Yorkers as yet show no desire to
adopt the fancy waistcoats, which have
been so much discussed of late.
I see that the ties for evening and semi
eveuins: wear are wider and broader. Of
course they must be tied by the wearer,
made-up affairs being an abomination.
Him writes to Vogue: "I must again
state that never has there been a season in
which ihere were fewer novelties. The
minds of a number have become somber,
and the popular taste seems to rnn to
black. We had a very short run of the
brilliant Scotch plaids and tweeds, and to
day it is rare to see even a bright Drown
on the streets. Black serges and tweeds
and the reefer (which has gained unez-
pected popularity) are the only new things
so far that the winter has given us. The
square derby hats have been affected by a
number of men, but I think they are hid
eous. A few very large and stout men,
however, can wear these; but a 9 for others,
they should avoid them â but, of course,
they wont.
In ties tnere are absolutely no new de
signs. Everywhere it is the black, dark
blues and greens with the same little
white figures sprinkled over them, or here
and there by way of a variation the same
designs in yellow and red. The ascots.
are very much less puffed and the aprons
meet at a very sharp angle.
I really believe that the greatest novel
ties are in dressing gowns and pajamas.
These are of all hues of the rainbow and
the stripes of bright pink and blue are
much wider than formerly and in the
lormer are of that staring hue that- one
sees in tne old-fashioned cream candy.
Collars continue upright and the all-round
turn-down is not as much in vogue as it
was during tne autumn.
Smart men have entirely given up the
Hombourfc hat, for the gray with the blacK
clotii band has been seen in the Bowery
for some lime post, so naturally this stylo
has been abandoned. C. C.
The Passing of the
Trapper and Trailer
Among the changes that an advancing
civilization and a senseless denudation of
forest land â¢ are creating . throughout . the
length and breadth of a great continent,
none re more - conspicuous â  than > those
pertaining to the fauna of. this country.
The solitudes of the great primeval forests,
that ; formerly/ abounded ; in - wild game,
beautiful birds and fowls . of the air.; and
valuable fur-bearing animals, are now
nearly as deserted \ as the great Western
plains, where the buffalo long sines left
nothing but traces of his existence behind.
Trappers find it more difficult to obtain
their furs each season/ and along with the
sportsmen they ; retreat 'further into the
cold regions north of us, penetrating into
the wilds of British America, where life
in 1 winter is scarcely endurable. â¢;
The fur-trapper has had his day in the
United States, observes the Philadelphia
Times, and as a product of past conditions
he is disappearing as surely as the game
which he has hunted. In the greafnorth
ern belt of the States bordering upon the
Canadian line he is found in dwindling
numbers, vainly striving to make a living
in his precarious calling and bemoaning
the times when it was an easy matter to
find enough animals in his traps each day
to keep him supplied with money. "It is
now the work of a week to gather the
skins that formerly came to his traps in a
day. %
The popularity of furs has not declined.
In fact, they are more in demand than
ever, and fashion decrees that they shall
be worn every winter on garments for
men ana for women. Most of them com
mand a higher price than ever in the his
tory of civilization, but the trapper does
not profit as much by this change as
might be supposed. The fur- bearing ani
mals are disappearing faster than the
prices for the furs advance. Other unset
tled regions of the globe are being ex
plored to help supply the markets of the
world with skins and science is doing
everything in its power to utilize the
common skins of the domesticated ani
mals.
The fur of the cat, dog, sheep, lamb and
other animals of our barnyard and house
hold has already become valuable com
mercially, and through the dyer's art and
the currier's skill the wearers of cheap
furs are totally deceived.
It ia not an easy matter to ascertain the
relative value of the important furs, but
those taken from the forests and woods of
this country are much higher than in
former days. The silver fox, that
abounded so plentifully in onr Northern
woods, is now a comparatively rare ani
mal, and from $100 to $200 is paid for
first-class specimens. The darker the fur
of the silver fox the more valuable it is,
and consequently the farther north the
trappers go the better luck they have.
Those over the Canadian border trapwnore
and better silver foxes than can be found
anywnere in the United States, although
Northern Maine and the Michigan penin
sula have yielded some excellent silver
foxes. Owing to the great demand for
this fur, the animals have been trapped
and hunted so persistently that they are
very scarce and the few remaining ones
are more timid and harder to catch than
the common red fox.
Bear skins generally come next to the
furs of the silver foxes, and they run all
the way from $40 to $75 aDiece for the raw
fur. Dealers prade the skins according to
their idea of the value, and the trapper is
not always sure that he will receive the
highest quotation even after he has
shipped his booty to market. The cross
fox fur com* s third on the list, Aid is
generally worth from $15 to $20, according
to size, general beauty and richness of
color. The fur of the otter is nearly as
valuable, and a good specimen will com
mand $18 either at the country store or in
the city markets. The beaver is not
worth more than $15, the wolverine $10,
the Jynx and black raccoon $6 and the
common wolf and marten $5. These are
the principal fur-b?aring animals caught
by the trappers in this country, but alone
list of cheaper ones are brought to the
market, such as the mink, skunk, badger,
wildcat, red and grny fox, muskrat and
rabbit. The price paid for these vary
from a few cents apiece up to several dol
lars. The rabbit skins are so cheap that
the trappers would not take the trouble to
express them to the cities if it were not
for the fact that they can be packed in
with the others at no extra cost.
The skins of the deer, moose, elk and
antelope must not be confounded with
those of the strictly fur-bearing animals.
The former are sold as skins and hides,
and not as furs, bringing so much a
pound. Deer hides usually bring from 20
to 3G cents per pound. As mo3t State
laws forbid trappers killing these animals
except during a very short season, there
is not so much profit in hunting them as
the prices offered would seem to war
rant.
The trapper is essentially what his name
implies, and not a Hunter or sportsman.
Tne shotgun is not bis implement, for
this tears and injures the skins ann fur?.
The traps and skinning knife are his cuief
articles of trade. The traps are usually
divided into three classes â snares, dead
falls and steel traps. The steel traps vary
in size from the small ones set to capture
the little muskrat to the large double
spring arrangements known as "grizzly
bear traps." These latter are mammoth
affairs, weighing forty pounds, and with
rows of sharp teeth spread sixteen inches
apart. When Ihe rows of such a trap
close upon any creature they are pretty
sure to break his leg and ho d the captive
prisoner until relieved by some outside
person. The grizzly bears have been
! known to tear the heavy traps from their
J moorings and drag them a mile or more
through the forests, but they have never
been known to pull the lee away from the
relentless teeth.
The deadfalls are made both for large
and small ariimala. In the small horse
shoe inclosure a tempting bait is fastened
on a delicate trigger, which, when slightly
moved, lets down upon the animal's back
a number of heavy loxs. TbesÂ« fall
squarely upon the back or shoulders of
the hunery creatnre, and either break it
or crush out the life. The animal caught
in a deadfall rarely lives to tell the tale.
The wary animals, like the fox, can sel
dom be induced to enter a dead all, for
their instincts make them suspicious.
Snares are used for catching a variety of
small animals, and they are arranged in a

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALLREVEALED ON THE CITY FRONT
\ Dems J<ean\ey Learns the JWe History of
a Strange Long Black Hull
of us went down to the City
front to look at the ships. My co m
*4^ panionwas a French exile, who had
been banished from his native land during
the leign of Napoleon 111. Being a re
publican he disliked that monarch.
France, he thought, was not big enou.-h
to hold both of them. Either one or the
oiher must go.
But my friend was not alone. There
were others of his way of thinking. So all
the- king-haters gathered themselves to
gether and from behind the ramparts of
. Montmartie and the barricades they
hurled defiance and solidev things at the
throne and its minions. He soon found,
though, that for him it was the guillotine
or banishment, and he chose the latter.
â¢ He is a cultured gentleman, of nice
. taste, is fond of good books and fine
wines. His abode is on Telegraph Hill,
close to the summit, and his high-up
house overlooks the beautiful bay and the
hill* around and about it. In the rear is a
garden that is marveious to look at. The
patches are all laid out in terraces that
have been cut in solid rock, and are made
to blossom in the summer, and in the
winter, too. Posies, daisies and roses
grow here side by side with lettuce, rad
-. dishes and leeks. But what of the cellar,
with its lashings of wine, and to spare?
Snail I describe it? I won't, for we now
are among the ships, and they interest me
more.
' The Lancing is discharging at Howard
street wharf and we are looking at her.
She has a long black hull and tall taper
ing masts, the lower ones being very high,
with yards in plenty, for she is tour-masted
and. square rigged on every mast. But the
bows, the very sharp yacht-like bows, are
â¢ what I noticed more particularly.
"That hull was never built for a sailing
ship," said I, turning to a thick, stubby
old man whose face resembled the porcu
ime in bristles and color. He had on an
old sou'wester that looked the worse for
wear and an oilskin coat that was full of
patches. He must be a sailor, I thought,
from the cut of his jib, and that's why my
remarks weie addressed to him.
''Not at all, mon," he answered, speak
ing with a cockney accent. "That there
ship used to be the French mail boat
Perier, and a flash un she was in 'er day.
it cost 'alf a million pounds to build 'er.
I made 'alf a dozen voyages in 'ar meseif
as quartermaster in the early 'w's. She
was bran' new then and made regular
trips between Havre and New York."
The old shellback's statement had a
surprising effect upon my friend from
Telegraph Hill. He acted as one who re
ceived a sudden stroke of paralysis, and
looked to U3 like an image that was glued
to the dock. A man, and a Frenchman
at that, petriried by the simple mention of
a steamer's name was indeed a curiosity,
and the proper place for him would be
â  the Park Museum. Arrangements could
Le made with the Commissioners, 1
thought, to stand him up out tnere in
that space between Bardwell's clock and
De Young's picture as a curio worth see
ing.
But he revived, and as he did so I sug
gested that he tell what hit him. He
gurgled up an oath. It was in French,
and, therefore, unintelligible to me.
"Perier!" he gasped on recovering his
reason. "She's a relic of the fraudulent
and ruinous speculations which were the
shame of the Second Empire."
"But," I inquired, "what has that got
to do with the shock which came so near
landing you in Bardwell's curiosity
shop?"
"Let's go on board and I'll tell you."
THE HEAVENS IN 1897
Astronomical phenomena sometimes I
occur at intervals of such different length
â¢that there would seem to be a random dis
tribution, only that the annals of the past
d'aclose uniformity in the irregularity.
.The opening year is rather an interval of
general non-occurrence than otherwise,
especially to Pacific Coast observers. Of I
the two solar eclipses, which are inevita
ble phenomena every year, neither is total
and one is entirely invisible here. There
is no lunar eclipse. The planetary con
junctions, with one exception, are im
: portant or occur in daylieht. The few
occukations of interest avoid the evening
hours. Mars will not be in opposition.
Neither Jupiter nor Saturn will be in par
ticularly favorable positions for observa
tions.
Tbe succeeding constellations will
spangle the evening firmament in due sea
son, but it is Dot known that any large
comet wili sweep over them in its lumi
nous flight; nor is it even certain that the
long-expected shower of November me
teors will brighten the decline of the year.
This is the negative side, in some respects
.a. contrast to the years preceding and foi
, towing. There will be two annular eclipses,
â  Â«o called because the sun's disk extends
L^eyond that of the moon, encircling it
â¢ like a luminous ring. This occurs when
â¢the moon is not of sufficient anparent size
to entirely obscure the sun, though pasÂ«
--â¢ ingtentrally over its disk. At such times
tt is generally at or near apogee. The
eclipse of February 1 being invisible here,
that of Juiy 29 will be the chief astronomi
cal event. Thou? h annular to observers in
a Une crossing Mexico and the ocean, in
this more northerly latitude it will be
merely partial, one-half of the disk being
eclipsed at the time of greatest obscura
tion. As first contact takes place shortly
after sunrise, and last contact before 7
A. m., the entire phase will occur while the
sun is near the northeastern horizon.
Though tbe same scientific value does not
attach to it as to a total eclipse, it is al
ways well worthy of observation.
.. The beautiful planet Venus, now in the
western sky, will continue to be an even
ing star until the end of April, after which
it will be a morning star until the end of
the year. In the coming months ample
. opportunity will be afforded the great
tetescopes of the world to reveal or fail to
reveal the definite shadings seen on its
surface by the observers of Flagstaff.
Until the beginning of Beptembei, Jupiter
will continue to illuminate the evenings,
being in opposition on February 23. It
will be in conjunction with Mars on July
24, and both may be seen in the west
after dart:, seven minutes apart, like a
I wide double star whose components are
I fferentiy tinted. An occultation of some
of the Pleiades will take place past mid
n glit, Augnst 19 tnd 20, when the waning
hulf-moon, then in the eastern heavens,
will wander near the group. They will
also be occulted by the gibbous moon in
fhe early morning hours of November 10.

Acting on his suggestion three of ns
went on to her topgallant forecastle,
when the old sailor loaded bis pipe and
sat on a coil of rope that lay abaft the
cathead, while the exile leaned up against
the capstan and delivered the following
bit of French history :
"Two noted schemers," he said, "were
born in Bordeaux in the early part of the
present century. Their names were Jacob
and Isaac Perier. They were educated at
St. Simon, and with the knowledge thus
gained they worked on the simplicity of
the French people and became rich. It
was this ill-gotte # n money that made Na
poleon Ill's coup d'etat possible. As a
recompense the Government ol that
monarch gave to these two corruptioni-ts
very valuable concessions, among which
was the authorization to establish the
Credit Mobilier. They put everything in 10
shares, mostly fraudulent, and this worth
less paper was given to the French people
in exchange for their money. An era of
wild speculation followed which lasted tor
fifteen years. Shares of the Credit Mobilier
went skyward. In March, 1556, they were
quoted at 1982 francs, or $396 per share.
In October, 1867, they had fallen to 140
franc 3, or $28 a share. In 1868 the concern
was thrown into bankruptcy, declared by
the court to be a robbery and the liquida
tor was ordered to pay each shareholder
$20 a share for his stock. Of course the
shareholders were ruined, but not so with
the brothers Perier, for tUeir fortune at
the end of the collapse was estimated to
be $32,000,000.
"It was when these shares were at the
highest that the Periers advised French
men to buy, telling them at the same time
that it was the safest and most profitable
investment for widows, orphans and
fathers of families.
"The headquarters of this brace or wor
thies was in Paris, It was there they cut
their widest swathe. They engineered
immense schemes, built great boulevards,
some of which they had named after them
selves. Back roiches were turned into
fine front lots that taced on these boule
vards. This ship was a part of one of
their schemes, and the rivets in her must
have cost our family one franc apiece.
"Isaac Perier was anxious to become a
member of the Chamber of Deputies, and
in 1863, with the full consent of the man
of Sedan, he offered himself as a candi
date in the department of Pyrenese
Oriental and was elected, but he never
took his seat, as the election "was ques
tioned on the ground of fraud, for he had,
through his agents, bribed most of the
electors who voted for him. In 1869 Na
po'on 111 induced him to try again in
another department, which he did, and
was successful, but his election was also
annulled, for the proof was established
that the voters had been corrupted."
My friend was very excited when deliv
ering the foregoing statement, but it ex
plains in part the shock which unnerved
him. Here he was in the presence of a
ship whose name brought back memories
of relatives ruined for daring to be re
publicans and called up in his own mind
the sorrow which he experienced at the
time he was banished irom the land of his
fathers to wander unions strangers m a
strange land. All these things combined
wouJd have upset most any man under
similar circumstances.
Though close on to 60 years of age the
old centleman still celebrates the fall of
the Bastil? as if he were but 20. But all
the same he is a patriotic American, for
when he came here he brought the re
publican ideas that he imbioed in his
youth with him and he has stamped them
on his children. Denis Kearney.

These are the few astronomical events

the year, but for telescopic astronomy the
firmament always affords unending scope

WILLIAM GREER HARRISON'S MINIATURE THEATER.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 3, 1897.
DENIS KEARNEY LEARNS SOME INTERESTING FRENCH HISTORY.
W. GREER HARRISON'S MINIATURE THEATER
HoW jie Arranges the Stage Settings for J4is NeW Drama WKicK
Miss Katkryr\ fielder Will Produce Shortly in NeW York
\tJZ .ATHRYN KIDDER writes that she
VVO'is applying herself to the study of
X^l^ "A Fixed Idea," the comedy writ*
ten for her by William Greer Harrison.
She expresses herself, after a first reading,
as much pleased with it, but suggests a
little more fun-making as a possible im
provement.
In the meantime Mr. Harrison had
rather anticipated the suggestion and had
already sent another writing of it. in
which gleams of sunshine had been more
jilentifully scattered. For "A Fixed Idea,"
comedy that it is, teils a rather serious
story.
Mr. Harrison is having a good deal of
fun with the play himself and in advance
of other peop!e. He has that right, of
course, it being his piay.
Sidney Chidley, the well-known artist
and stage carpenter, has built for Mr.
Harrison a miniature stage â an exact
reproduction of that of the California
Theaterâ with all ths ropes and pulleys,
the gridiron up above, sky borders, tor
mentor, wings, foot and top lights, and all
the rest of it. The stage is four feet wide
and three feet deep and the grid
iron three feet above the stage.
All the scenery necessary for pro
duction of "A Fixed Idea" has been
painted and prepared, including decorated
ceilings for tue interior, "working win
dows" and doors. Furniture for complete
settings of the several scenes ha 3 been
manufactured or purchased, all to abso
lutely correct scale. Nor has the drop
curtain been forgotten. It is of silk, on
which is spread a marine view with
Roman galleys in the foreground. All
this has been prepared under the direction
of Mr. Harrison's chief lieutenant in the
business, George Adams, who assists in
its manipulation, now that everything is
ready. All the characters of the play
have, of course, been built with the same
care as to details in dress and color of the
eyes and hair as conceived and described
by the author.
The toy theater was first set up in Mr.
Harrison's office on California street, but
it attracted so much attention and there
was such a crush of deadheads who in
sisted on gettine behind the scenes and
pulling the ropes and disconcerting the
actors, that Mr. Harrison had the theater,
the company and all hauled out to his
house in an express-wagon. There in tbe
quiet of his own bedroom almost nightly
may be seen â or rather, except by the
invited few, may not be seenâ in panto
mime and miniature, the performance of
"A Fixed Idea."
As Mr. Harrison reads the lines Mr.
Adams moves the figures, causes Mr. Fer
ris or Mr. Lake to come or go, places
Beatrice and John on the red plush sofa
to make love, has the major 10 throttle
the villain at the cry of "Coward," and
causes the stately doll who is Queen Mab
to fall at a critical moment in a fainting
1 spell in the center of the stage well
toward the footlights.
All this has afforded Mr. Harrison and
his friends much entertainment.
Mr. Harrison says he is going right
along writing plays until one of them is
distinctly stamped as great. He may
quit them or not, just as the sensation
that comes to him under the influence of
such success may suggest. In the mean
time his stage will serve its purpose. He
is even now writing a musical skit and in
tends its early production in this fashion
with musical accompaniment before a
selected company of his friends.
The theme in ''A Fixed Idea" is a
rat tier hold one and its treatment is neces
sarily so, although, of course, artistically
inoffensive, as might be expected from the
author.
Queen Mabâ the star partâ a delicate,
high-strung woman, a widow, goes
through the four acts of the play under a
spell wrought by Felix Ferris, t..e villain,
who has hypnotic powers. Ferris was a
friend of Queen Mab's late husband, and
since the tatter's death Las laid desperate
siege to her affections, but without win
ning them. Before the opening of the
play he had resort to his occult power,
and while she remained under its influ
ence he tried to ruin her, but failed. He
left the impression with her, however,
that he had done so, and this is the "fixed
idea" that gives the motif to the play.
In the last act the villain,"wht> has fallen
a victim himself to a plot he laid to ruin
financially Maud's other and favored
lover. Major Standish, comes seeking the
favor of "a few hundred" to put him on
his feet again. In this consideration he
allows Sam Lake, a young doctor who
has been practicing hypnotism, to experi
ment upon him. He succumbs to the in
fluence, and then in the presence of Queen
Mab and the major and all the rest of
them he reveals his secretâ that Quean
Mab has been suffering an hallucination,
and is pure, as all her friends had ever
thought her.
The play has two endings as written,
and Miss Kidder has not signified which
of them she prefers. Mr. Harrison pre
fers that, in the fullness of her joy at this
discovery, she rises up aad die 3in her
true lover's arms. This is made easy by a
heart that flutters overmuch all through
the play. The other ending is that she
ri^ee up and lives in her lover's arms. The
author thinks that to die is more artistic,
but admits that audiences, the country
over, may prefer that a good girl, such as
Maud is proved to be, should live and im
prove in health and get married.
The play is full of bright things. For
instance, these epigrams in the mouth of
the villain Ferris, in the first act. Florence
Wiirnott lias been reading the lines of his
hand and giving him a rather bad charac
ter with ultimate misfortunes.
Florenceâ lf I may be permitted to advise
you, Ferris, your hand suggests that a prac
tice of virtue might mitigate your threatened
misfortune.
Ferrisâ My dear Miss W'illmott, virtue is a
mere quality of the blood. Some have it and
lose it, and others, not having it, cannot
lose it.
. Keeneâ You're wrong, Ferris. Virtue is its
own reward.
Ferrisâ Add and Its "only" reward, ana I'll
apree with you.
Lakeâ Virtue is a condition not dependent
upon reward.
Ferrisâ Extremely proper, my dear fellow,
but scarcely logical.
Tomâ Well, define virtue for us, Mr. Ferris.
Ferris â Oh, virtue is a prolonged Lent.
In the third act is a scene between
Queen Mab and Major Standish and EN
sic, Queen Mab's little girl, which, Mr.
Harrison thinks, under the charm of Miss
Kidder's "business," will catch the peo
ple. The scene also offers a sample oi
Queen Mab's disposition to say things
tnat are almost forbidden. The little girl
does most of the talking. The others
have left Queen Mab and her daughter
alone on the stage.
Elsieâ Now, mamma, if you are a good girl I
will tell you all about my new doll.
Queen Mabâ What doll, dear?
EUieâ Major Standish's.
Queen Mabâ What, did Jackâ Major Standish
âsend yo'i a new doll?
Elsieâ Yes; but it is aot a soldier doll. It is
just a girl doll, with great big eyesâ lovely
eyes like your?, mamma.
Queen Mabâ My little sweetheart I (Bends
ami kisses her.) *
Enter Jack.
Queen Mab â Ah, major! I find you have
been winning my little girl's heart.
Jack (softly) â If it were only her mother's.
Queen Mabâ Oh, get a doll big enough and â
will you come and join the family circle?
Jack (to Mildred as he settles himself on the
grass)â Won't you' kiss me, dear?
Elsieâ Yes ; for you are my new doll's papa.
(She puts her arms about his neck and kisses
him. Queen Mab looks on df lighted.)
Queen Mab â Isn't she lovely? Isn't she
sweet? You could love her, Jack.
Jackâ l do love her. Edith. (To the child)
How large a family have you?
Elsieâ Six.
Jackâ What, six ? That is a big family.
Queen Mabâ This is a domestic lesson for
you, Jack. We. Elsie and I, do not believe in
the new mode ofâ oh, well, it is too compli
cated a subject for Elsie.
Jackâ Tell us all about your family, Ehie.
Elsieâ Well, there Is Boy-blue. He is a very
good boy, but sometimes he won't go to sleep.
Jack â And what do you do to him?
Elsieâ Just sing to him ana tell him I won't
love him if he won't sleeD. Then there is
Beatrice. Oh, she is a terror. She won't do a
thing unless I let her have Boy-blue all to her
self.
Jackâ She is good then ?
Elsieâ Oh, she is lovely then. And there is
Edith; she's a dear, sweet girlâ she is no
trouble. And then there is the Fairy Prince;
he is very odd and wants all the others to. wait
en him. But I just turn his face to the wall
until he's good. Then there is Rags, and
Ragsâ well, he is just Rags.
Jackâ And your new doll, dear. What have
you called her?
Elsieâ Oh, Qneen Mab. She is just like
m amma. Yon love Qneen Mab, don't you ?
Jack (heartily)â That I do with all my heart
Queen Mab â I am afraid your new doll, dear,
will make you forget poor little Rags, of whom
you wero so fond.
Elsie (after thinking)â Mamma, if the dear
God were to give you another little girl would
you forget me ?
Queen Mabâ No, no, my darling, no, no (kiss
ing her). But come, show your doll's papa
how expert a little mother you are.
(Here Elsie begins to undress the doll, ex
plaining each part of dress to Jack. Queen
Mab is laughing heartily all through the per
formanceâjollying Jack, who is much embar
rassed).
Elsieâ You see, I take off her bonnet care
fully, so as to not muss her hair, for she has a
party this evening. Then I take off her capo
and fold it neatly â there. Now we take off her
frock â so â and hang it up. She hasn't too
many frocks, so I mustn't rumple this one.
Now I take off her little petticoatâ isn't it
sweet, Jack? Ah (taking off the one remain-
Ing bifurcated garment and holding up).
Look at them! Are they not just too pretty
for anything ? Don't you wish you could
wear such nice things ? And now I put her
nighty on. Now that's the prettiest dress she
has. Just look at it !
Jackâ lt's beautiful. What a clever little
woman you are, and what a lot you know.
Elsieâ Yes, Jack; I know everything. And
now we must put Queen Mab to bedâ that is,
my Queen Mab, you know. Say, Jnck, my
Queen Mab is better than yours 'cause she
can't talk back. If I were you I would have
only a doll queen. They're much less trouble
than real live queens.
The play will probably see its first pro
duction in New York City.
The Dangers of India.
India is a dangerous country to live in,
as the following figures showing the
deaths from wild beasts and snakes dur
ing one recent year will testify. la one
twelvemonth snakes Killed no less than
19,740 persons. Tigers killed 1063 persons
and 27,517 head of cattle; bears, 126 per
sons and 315 cattle; wolves, 177 persons
and 4087 cattle; hyenas, 17 cersons and
2748 cattle: elephants, 56 persons and 4
cattle; while other w'ld beasts, such as
jackalls, buffaloes, boars, crocodiles, etc.,
were responsible for the deaths of 969 per

She was a frail little creature, and now

back against the lamppost. The black
Quaker bonnet which she wore made a
fitting frame for the white pinched lace,

She stopped playing, more at the sound

trembled.
"Have you received much to-day?"
"During holidays people are generous,"
she replied.
"A cold night, madam," and a man
stepped in frout of the little woman and
looked at me with a pair of cold gray
eyea, that were enough to send a chill
clear through a Christmas sealskin. And
at the sound of the man's voice the woman
began the bellows-like movement, and
with a siirh of resignation the instrument
belched forth another mouthful of dis
cord.
But the man! What a typical villain !
No doubt he compelled this poor creature
to sit there and play while he spent the
profits of his heartless scheme. He was
not coarse-looking. His face had a deathly
palior; his gray mustache dropped grace
fully over his thinly chiseled lips, and un
derneath the old and queerly shaped hat
was an abundance of iron-gray hair. His
overcoat was shabby and he had a peculiar
walk, as though he was hardly able to lift
his feet; but the watch he kept on that
frail little woman was catlike. From the
other side of the thoroughfare I saw her
stand up, put the accordion under her
shawl, pick up her little campstool and
turn her face toward Montgomery street.
Curiosity overcame me. I followed.
Down Montgomery street and on, yezy
slowly, for her steps were uncertain, until
she had passed the crowd, and then she
paused in answer to a low whistle and
leaned against a lamppost.
From the darker side of the street a
man appeared. He had on a faded over
coat and a queerly shaped hat and he
walked with difficulty.
He took out a large bandana handker
chief and held it spread out in his hands.
"What did you get?" I heard bini ask.
for answer she gave him the little tin
cup. He emptied the contents into the
kerchief and tied it up carefully, then put
it into his overcoat pocket.
"It must be four or five dollars," he
said. "That's good 1"
Then he took her arm, and they walked
on slowly â very slowiy â up the hill to
Broadway. A youue woman was stand
ing at the corner with a child in her arms
and a shawl wrapped about them both.
"Who are they?" she said. "I know
them. The old man's spine's been hurt,
and he can't do nothin', an ! the woman's
blind. She plays at the corners downtown
and he stays near to look after her. You
never see one without t'other. They got
hurt in a tire, I think, or somethin," she
went on. "The woman they live with
told me. They had a little girl baby, an'
she died, and the mother can't see her
picture, so the man takes it an' tells her
all about it every night. The wails are
thin, you know, and they can hearevery
tning. An' then, she says, the woman
cries an' takes on so an' says she don't
want to live. Poor things! But they say

added, sharply, as a man rushed past her
and looked at her insolently. "If the

me of Samson â shorn of his strength yet

grieving of some stray, lonely spirit â only
perhaps epirits even when alone wouldn't
grieve to the tnne of "Just Tell Them

A crowd of urchins was standing in the
gutter staring up at the man's strange
convolutions. Presently each one began
sawing on an imaginary fiddle, for all thÂ«
world like smaller editions of himself, and
at the same time sang in wretched rhythm:
Come to me, sweet Ma-rle,
Sweet Ma-rie, come to me.
At the end the man leaned hard against
the post, and looked with the large, inno

Legend of the Snowdrop
kF\fJÂ£ the close of one cold wintry day,
s*faH>" after Adam and Eve had been
i\*v driven from the Garden of Eden,
Eve stood alone, gazing sorrowfully at tbe
snow-clad earth.
Tears welled up in her eyes and deep
sighs escajed from her drawn lips us she
looked in vain ior one little flower and
strained her listening ears in the hope
that she might catch the song of one tiny
warbler.
Her heart was filled with regrets for the
preen fields of her lost paradise where
flowers so fragrant ever bloomed, and
where songs iull of praise ever filled the
balmy air.
Now it happened that an angel flying
past, on some errand of mercy bent, saw
and pitied Eve as she stood in the blind
ine snow, and paused in liis graceiul flight.
Alighting by her side he asked In tones
full of compassion:
â¢Why stand ye here, oh, mortal? and
why ihete bitter tears?"
Deeply touclied by his sympathy she
poured into his gentle ears her tale of
woe.
Instantly his heart was filled with love
most tender.
He caught in his fair right hand a tiny
flaKe of snow as it was eddying past.
Parting his beautiful lips he blew upon
it a breath so freighted with fragrance
that it might have been wafted lrom
Arabia's s-p'-cy shores.
Then lie bade it a flower be, that would
bring consolation to the weary hearts of
men wherever it might chance to bloom,
in tones so sv;eet and soft that Eve raised
her reverently bowed head, but, alas, the
angel vision had vanished, and she was
alone!
No, not all alone, for at her feet lay a
beautiful wreath woven of the dainty blos
soms we call snowdrops. Catching it up
sbe pressed it to her lie aving breast, and
her soul was filled with that peace which
passeth all understanding, and the
precious hope of immortality which ever
since has burned in the hearts of men.

If there te one thing more than another
that Californians pride themselves upon
it is their hospitality. Just let any organ
ization signify its intention of meeting at
a town and immediately that town exerts
itsell to welcome the visitor, and inci
dentally to rival all former receptions the
body has enjoyed.
Santa Cruz was laboring under the wel
coming excitement, for there the Califor
nia State Teachers' Association was to
hold its annual meeting between Christ
mas and New Year's.
At Stockton, the year before, represen
tatives from Santa Crnz had invited the
association to their charming home by the
sea, in glowing terms describing it as "The
land of eternal sunshine and perpetual
bloom."
And now â well, it was an unusual win
ter. (In California all inclement weather
Is unusual.) It had been raining furi
ously for four weeks, and even now there
was no sign of clearing: The rose bushes
were covered with buds, but the heart of

each had become embittered by the con
stant nagging of the elements, and had
withered up in despair.
However, the good people were deter
mined that their hearts and interiors
would be so sunshiny that the Storm
King would reign unnoticed.
To make arrangements a committee was
appointed, and trom it, Miss Nutter, a
teacher of the highest grammar grade,
was chosen to take charge of t'.ie decora
tions, not such an easy task without flow
ers, m California where every one expects
a mass of bloom, even in the heart of win
ter. But Miss Nutter had an artistic
mind, and willing assistants in her pupils.
On Friday, before holiday week, she di
vided tbe older boys into committees to
get materials for decorationsâ one to get
redwood, one bamboo, one flowers and one
Christmas berries. The last was composed
of Bert Edwards, Joe Sales and Will
Mackin, three chums, who were seldom
apart. Will was of a very hopeful dispo
sition, seeing great fortunes ahead, and if
one scheme failed ready to adopt another.
Joe was cautious, but quick-witted, af
fectionate and never happier than when
teasing those he liked best. Bert came be
tween, with his quiet, happy ways,
smoothing many a little eruption of
temper.
As they met together after school Joe
asked: "Aren't you plad she chose us to
! get the Christmas berries? It's easy
| enough to get redwood and bamboo and
| flowers, but to get enough Christmas
berries we'll have to skirmish over the
hills."
"Poof!" scorned Will. "I know where
there ore lots of berriesâ the reddest
and most perfect."
"Most perlect ! And you're ready for
graduation," laughed Joe.
'Oh, that's nothing to some of your
breaks, old char; but I don't care for
grammar now. My mind's on Christmas
berries."
"Poor little ruind can hold only one
thought!" interrupted Joe; but Will,
never heeding him, continued: "You
know the hill the other side of the gulch
where vre found ttiat blackberry patch
la>t summer on old man Davis' ranch?
(California boys, with even the best inten
tions, will forget the proper prefix to a
man's name.) Let's go over to-morrow
and investigate."
"I'll bet we don't get one," answered
Joe. "I'll bet those creasers have got
them all. You know Jacinto and Pedro
Garc a ship them to San Francisco."
'Ob, the dickens! 1 suppose, then, we
won't find a decent bunch within ten
miles. Those greasers take everything,"
and Will's hopeful face fell so low that Joe
laughed ana teasingly saiu :
"Not everything, chaDpy. Wasn't it
you that exclaimed last week against the
laziness of the greaser and disputed with
us on the injustice of the gringo? Now,
when they exert themselves a little, you
grumble too. It takes a lot to satisfy
some people."
"Oh, shut up your joshing. You don't
like them any better than I," answered
Will, not quite amiably.
"Look here, fellows, you're getting on
dangerous ground," chimed in Bert, fear
ing an explosion. "Let's get down to busi
ness. Can you fellows go hunting for
berries to-morrow afternoon? lam sure I
can." â¢
"Yes, of course."
"Well, then, let's start at 1â"
'â¢Hold on! I can't get off soearly," put
in Joe. "The dear maternal's got no girl,
and I must help do the lunch dishes.
Can't leave her with the dishes, and Kutb,
too, that chiidâ"
"Another Ruth story," groaned Will;
but Bert added: "Don't mind him. He's
only jealous. It's hard luck to be an only
child. What's Miss Perpetual Motion's
latest?"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 3, 1897.
"Well, you know she has a starak
on of running away. If one's back is
turned a minute she skips. Last
night the dear maternal was getting
supper and I went for some wood.
Ruth followed me out and when I went
into the shed she glided to the front yard,
squeezed through the end of the fence and
flew down the strtet. Then I missed her
and had to race down the corner before I
caught her. Of course her eye 3 were
dancing and her hair flying and she
thought it a line joke. Going home I told
her a harrowing tale of a little girl that
slipped through a i-ole in the fence, ran
on the street, was caught by an eagle and
carried to its nest. Of course before the
eaglets hurt her a hunter rescued her and
returned her to her home. Ruth looked
anxious and asked, 'Den did big broder
mend hole i' fence?' You see all her
thoughts are bent on running away.
Moral for me â 'Don't leave dear maternal
with both work and baby.' "
"Well, what time can you start?"
''About half-past 1. You chaps come
for me and when I've finished we'll go.
Our house is on the way anyhow."
So it was settled.
Will wa3 tho only ton of a successful
lawyer and had few chores to intrude on
his time. Bert also had few chores, but
he was special messenger-boy to three
older sisters and his position was no sine
cure. His father owned the largest dry
goods store in town, and Bert would
probably have spent his Saturdays getting
an insight into the business, but that his
sisters insisted he needed one day for out
door exercise.
Joe's father was an officer on a small
steamer that traded along the coast, so
Joe was left quite often as sole protector
of his mother and baby sister, ana a chiv
alrous protector he was. He teased his
mother as a companion, called her by any
tender nicuname his reading or fancy dic
tated, but enveloped her with a devotion
that kept all minor cares and duties from
her.
At the appointed time Will and Ber
arrived and found Joe almost ready. In a
few minutes they started "to diskiver the
festive berry," as Joe remarked.
A ter an hour's tramp they reached the
desired hillside only to find the glossy
trees stripped of their crowning glory.
Although they wore prepared for this,
each boy felt disappointed in his inmost
heart. They looked at each other and
burst into a laugh.
"What lots of beautiful berries!"
mocked Joe. "Admit, chappy, for once the
greasers are ahead of us."
"They're not ahead of us," replied Will,
"for we didn't plan to get berries till yes
terday, and likely they've been shipping
them since Thanksgiving. But, say â
what are we going to do?"
"Search for more trees to plunder."
"But where? Those fellows have been
all over these hills, I bet, and it's no fun
out in this rain."
'â¢Oh, you're neither sugar nor salt, and
if you were that rubber suit would protect
you."
"How would it do," interrupted tfert,
"for us to go to old Davis himself? We
can tell him why we want the berries, and
you know he is such a botany crank
that he knows every bush on his place.
Anyway, it would only be polite as we are
going to take his berries."
"That's just the thing. Let's go to him
at once."
"Wish we'd studied botany," sighed
Will. "If we could call off the botanical
name we would win the old man's heart."
It is to be judged that "the old man's
heart" wasn't very hard, for when he had
listened to them his eyes twinkled. "To
decorate for the Teachers' Association !
And in all this rain! Well! Well! Times
are changed since I wjÂ»s a boy. You seem
to be friends with your teachers. Now,
we'd rather play pranks on them than
work for them."
"Our teachers," began Bert.
"Oh, I know the new generation of
teachers. Isu't my daughter one? But
let me see. You want Heteromeles
arbutifolia. Weil, I gave the Garcias leave
to picK all they want, but I reckon there's
enough for all."
"But," and Will gave the history of their
first exploration.
"Well, well! So you would have taken
them without leave, if you had found
them. Hey?"
"We didn't think about ownership, sir,"
apologized Bert; "we're so us?d to getting
blackoernes there and flowers, too."
"Now, ain't there beautifui flowers here?
There's nover a day when there is no
flower in bloom. Why, do you believe it,
yesterday I found four Ranunculus Ca!i
fornicns, in spite of all this rain. Let me
see. Do you know where the old adobe is?
Where Santo Moreles killed Juan Castro?
That was before you were born. There is
a clump of Heteromeles arbutifolia south
of the adobe. I reckon the Garcias
wouldn't go there, because the Mexicans
say it is haunted. You boys afraid of
ghosts?"
[CONCLUDED NEXT SUNDAY.]
The Courtyard Family.
The Stivers' courtyard fnirly gleamed
with brightness this Saturday after
noon. The red and gold of the
autumnal beeches shone merrily over the
wall and waved greetings to the busy,
budding chrysanthemums and asters in
the liower-bed3 below. The sand pile
glistened from its crown of castles, school
bouses and villages, due out ana Dianned
by skilled childish fingers. The ivy
danced gayly on the stone wall, glancing
coquettisbly upward to the one tall oak
tree, which threw its tiny acorns, in their
rustic cups, on the heads of the trio of
children playing around its feet.
Paul and Gerald Stivers, two manly fel
lows, were making the most of their
weekly holiday by romping away every
moment happily, and by getting ac
quainted with their new friend and sister,
little Edna Coblentz, who proved herself a
blithe companion in their sports and a
frolicsome lover of fun, like themselves.
Edna was indeed a treasure !
"I am glad I have taken her," thought
gcnt.e Mrs. Slivers, while sitting at the
window to watch the little ones play.
"She will be such a dear friend for my
boys!"
Edna had had a strange life for one so
young; for though only 7 years of age she
had been on the stage four long years, act
ing as httii Eva in "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
Her little hands and feet and voice had
earned many a dollar lor a delicate, wid
owed mother, whom God, bat a few weeks
before, had placed in Paradise.
Through friends Mrs. Stivers had
learned of the child'sdestituiion and lone
liness, and with the promptings of a lov
ing mother she had brought the child
home and had made room in the woman's
heart and purse for one more.
The children played ball, tossing it from
one to the otner, standing in the shape of
a triangle, until their arras became tired,
and they sought fresh occupation in a
game with the doll. This, however, was
not noisy enough for Paul and Gerald, so
Edna suggested a grand game, in which
the express-wagon was to be the staee t
Paul the conductor to take the fares, peb
bles the tickets. Gerald the horse, the doll
and ball passengers, whenever she herself
was not one.
The back steps and the oak tree were the
cities, and the trips between the two were,
in fact, remarkable for clatter and chatter.
Over the stones they went, bumpety
bump, and twisted in and out the flower
beds until, bang! they reached the post;
then back again.
Once the horse balked, tben reared up
and down, and finally refused outright to
move, all because he had lost a shoe.
What pleasure now ! . Gerald had to be
tied in the blacksmith's shop, while Paul
took a hammer and nailed on a new shoe,
and Edna stood before him and "whoaed"
and brushed off the imaginary flies with a
switch.
"Now, Gerald, I'm through 1" shouted
Paul at last.
"Get up," cried Edna.
"Oh, Edna, I don't want to play this
any more," pleaded the frisky horse, "I
think we could have ever so much more
fun telling stories."
"Oh, goody, goody, so do I," she an
swered cheerfully.
"All right, say we do," said Paul, lead
ins the way to the oak tree's shade, where
he threw himself down at full length, and
was quickly followed by the others.
"I am perfectly willing to talk, Gerald;
but I don't want to tell stories," began
Paul, who was an earnest, practical boy,
with a head and shoulders that indicated
future ability. "1 think it would be much
nicer to tell what we are going to do."
"Yes, Paul, you always know best. So
we will do what you want us to do; and
"GERALD HAD TO BE TIED WHILE PAUL NAILED ON A SHOE."
you please begin," replied Gerald, who
idolized his brother, and with his fair,
poetical face made a handsome contrastto
the serious Paul.
"Well, Gerald and Edna, I think I will
be a soldier."
"A soldier? Why, Paul, then you will
have to Kill some one!" exclaimed the
two.
"Oh, no, not unless some one does
wrong. I want to join the army, then I
will be ready, whenever I am called upon,
to fight for my country. Yes, just as I
heard Major Beck tell papa yesterday that
a soldier ought to bo willing, at any time,
to lay down ni3 life for his God, his coun
try and his home. Whew! wasn't he mag
niticent?" Paul's eye's glowed at the re
membrance or his boyish hero's flow of
patriotic words.
"But, Paul, I think I would rather fight
dragons!" said Gerald, growing extremely
roused.
"Dragons?"
"Why, yes; just like mamma is always
reading us about. I would love to be a
Magic Prince, and rescue lovely maidens.
I would love to have a horse with a golden
bridle, who could dash over any road, no
matter how rough it was, or plunge
through the deepest streams â "
"Why, Gerald, you are 'romancing,' "
said Paul, with a smile at his visionary
brother.
"No, lam not, Paul; I truly would like
to be a prince.''
"But there are no magic princes now,
Gam Id." â . ";'V' " â .- ' 'â -".- . '.. ".' '
"Perhaps there will be when I am a
man, thoutrh." said the little dreamer.
"Well, if Gerald is a prince, I want to
be an angel," cried Edna. "Such beauti
ful angels used to carry 'Little Eva' up
into heaven, and I always thought I
would like to be one of them."
Edna ceased, and her sweet face re
flected her baby thoughts of cherub forms
surrounded by great white wings show
ered with glittering spangles and flutter
ing over a mass of tulle draperies.
â¢An angel, dear sister?" echoed Paul,
gravely.
Then Gerald kissed the new sister, and
the three jumped ur> arm in arm and
walked into the house, just as Mrs. Stivers
was calling, "Supper-time, little ones!"
Then the house swallowed them up, and
the night hours crept along with a sheet
of darkness to cover over the house and
couriyard.
Ten years later Mrs. Stivers stood at the
same window, and looked out into the
same courtyard; yet not the same, for it
was empty. There were tears $ joy and
tears of sorrow in her eyes; for her mind
went back to the days of story-telling.
Paul was, indeed, Her soldier lad, but not
as he then had meant. His father had
died five years ago, and, lite a true soldier
of the cross, Paul had been loyal to his
duty, and had taken up his father's bur
den where he had laid it down. In the
fast-growing town her boy was the be
loved young physician who had held to
gether and increased his dead father's
practice.
Gerald, tne darling dreamer, had been
laid at rest by the side of his father. He
had indeed been a princeâa prince of
lightâ and had fought with, and had con
quered, dragonsâ the draeons of "the

A certain teacher of a class in a Mission
Sunday-school has a difficult task impart
ing scraps of religious instruction to her
young charges, and often amusing an
swers are unconsciously returned to ques
tions which she asks. On one occasion
she asked her pupils:
"What do the nigh priests do?"
And received the reply :
"They burn insects before the people."
But one of the funniest experiences,
which well shows the queer ideas which
the children receive in their lessons, was
given when, after a discui-ion of ship
wreck which followed a lesson three or
four weets previously on the well-known
story of Jonah and the whale, she hap
pened to ask:
"Suppose a big storm arose at sea and it
looked as though you were going to be
drowned, what would you do?"
"I would throw a man overboard for the
whale to swallow," was the reply.
An inspector of schools was one day
examining a class of villace school chil
dren, and he asked them what was meant
by a pilgrim. A boy answered, "A man
what travels from one place to another."
The inspector, with elaborate patience,
hoping to elucidate intelligence, said:
"Well, but I am a man who travels from
one place to another. Am I a pilgrim?"
Whereupon the boy Dromtitly exclaimed,
"Oh! but please, sir, I meant a good
man."
"Now, Johnny," said Miss Spriggins,
the schoolmistress, as she poised the gad
above the bad boy's back lor a moment,
"I want you to remember that when I
whip yon it is not because I enjoy bestow
ing punishmeut on you but because I
honestly desire to do you good."
"Huh!" retorted Johnny Squanch, in

EXTRACT FROM A CITY BOY'S LETTER TO HIS
COUSIN.
Dear Jim: I received the owl which you
sent me and like him first rate, but he is a
very queer bird. He sits on his percn in
the daytime with his eyes shut, and never
stirs. Sometimes I turn him upside down,
but he don't open his eyes or say any-
thing. When the room gets a little dark
be opens bis eyes wide and sits and stares
at me all the time. I don't think bis
eyes are right; they are too big. I call
him Number Six Owl, but he has Number
Ten Eyes. I am much obliged for the
owl, and send you a splendid parrot.
Yours truly, Tom.
Dear Tom: I'd like to trade back with
you. The parrot is a funny-looking bird,
but bis claws and bill are too sharp and
he is all the time trying to be too familiar
with me. When he gets his claws and
bill in my hair it makes me holler, and
then he swears. So I want to trade back.
Yours respectfully, Jim.

Tommy and His
Meddlesome Father
Once there was a little boy,
His name was Tommy Teddlesum,
Of all tne boys I ever knew
He was the most meddlesome.
He twisted^ turned and capsized thing!
Whene'er no one was looking;
Would put red pepper in the mush
Which on the stove was cooking.
When bedtime came the folks would search
The cover?, pillows, ticking,
For pins and needles lurked about
In slyest corners sticking.
He turned the Christmas presents round
In a manner really shocking!
Little Johnnies new tin horn
Went into grandma's stocking.
The popgun meant for Sammy-
He gave to sister Sue ;
And baby's woolen jacket
AH trimmed with pink and blue
Filled up the full capacity
Of papa's Christmas sock;
While Jack's cigar 6to stern Aunt Jane
Would surely give a shock.
When all was nicely disarranged
To Tommy's satisfaction,
He softly crept back into bed
Awaiting daylight's action.
Just then the door swung slowly back
With warning, squeaky squeaking,
And Tommy heard his father's shoes
Across the floor go creaking.
Then while he peeked the Christmas horn
Went back to Johnnies stocking;
And Jack's cigars had no more chance
To give Aunt Jane a shocking.
The baby's sack and Sammy's gun
Resumed their rightful places,
And soon of Tommy's promised fun
There was no further traces.
Then while a feeling of disgust
Came over Tommy Teddlesum,
Quoth he, "Of all the folks I know,
Pa's surely the most meddlesome."

Every one knows that if you turn a

Ms Caused by the Vanity of Woman
jÃecent Scientific Experiments SKoW the Injurious Effects of Veils
V- OMAN'S vanity has been the
xwaWrs? cause ol many ills, and now a
111/M^ Chicago physician is authority
for the statement that weak eyesight, head
aches, vertigo, and sometimes nausea, are
produced by wearing of veils. Indeed, he
practically admits that blindness is some
times brought about by the filmy nets.
The physician who makes this state
ment is Dr. Casey A. Wood. He is profes
sor of ophthalmolo y at the Post
Graduate Medical School and ophthalmic
surgeon to the Parravant Memorial Hos
pital in the Windy City, and is regarded
as one of the most eminent specialists in
the United States. This fact gives great
. weight to his words, and to prove his as
sertion the results of a dozen tests have
' been brought by him to the attention of
the scientific world.
Although much has been written about
-the ill effects of veils upon the eyesight,
little has been done in the way of deter
mining the exact degree of interference
' with vision which these ornamental pro
tectors bring about. It was t is fact that
red Dr. Wood to begin his investigations.
The direct cause of the many headaches
produced by wearing veils is found in the
fact that the eyes are under a continual
strain by being forced to see through or
around some object, and this strain, if kept
up for a sufficient length of time, of course
brings about more serious results.
Dr. Wood says in this connection: "As
in other cases of abuse, the burden rests
heaviest upon the weakest eyes, and prob
ably the reason why one encounters so
comparatively few instances of asthenopia
directly due to veil wearing ia that the
embarrassed eyes are aDle to overcome the
additional strain where the vision is nor
mal, the oculo-muscular system in proper
equilibrium and the general health good."
Dr. Wood, in beginning his experiments,
realized that different kinds of veils pro
duced different effects on the eye, and in
each of his dozen tests a person with a
normal 'eye was used as a subject.
According to authorities it must be
premised that a person having a normal
Vision is able to distinguish with each eye
separately capUal block letters (bold-faced
type) a quarter of an inch square at a dis
tance of twenty feet, and to read diamond
print with eas* at a distance of fourteen
inches. With this as a standard the re
suits of Dr. Wood's experiments were
truly remarkable. .
The first test was made with a line black
net veil having small blackdots two inches
apart and white flowers three inches apart.
There were 100 meshes to the square Inch,
with the dots a sixteenth of an inch in
diameter.
[ to a process of reauction is placed a
I microscopic lens in inverse ratio. Of
i coarse, the lens of the camera which
! takes this picture must of necessity be
different from the ordinary, or the two
lenses â that is, the camera lens and the
I microscopic lens â would "fire," as th 6
i photographers call it, and the person
I being photographed, if he or she appeared
: at all on the lens, would bear more the
! appearance of a museum freak than a
! normal specimen of the genus homo.
The lens used in the camera is of pe
culiar make and has been subjected to
| many strange and powerful tests, strange
i to the layman if not to the professional.
In any cv nt, it is a lens which will not
conflict with the microscopic lens in any
way.
The subject is posed and the camera
is ready. Possibly the subject may have
had a nose that seemed to him or her of
Brobdignagian proportions. Possibly it
might have been such a nose as that of
which Colonel William Visscher boasts,
if there is any microscopic lens which
would have any effect on that. So the
subsidiary lens is adjusted, the camera
properly focused, the button touched, and
the rest forced into history.
Now then for the developing process.
Just the same as with any other plate.
But ivhat is it makes the demon of the
dark room smile when, after the usual
Uporv the Eyesight
It was found that almost immediately
after patting on the veil distinct vision
was reduced in each eye by two-thirds.
Diamond print was read with difficulty
through the meshes. When a dot was
presented before the pupil, bourgeois was
the smallest type which could be de
ciphered.
The s cond test was made with a single
thread chenile dot, black lishnet, a veil
worn very frequently by the fair sex.
There were sixteen squares and sixteen
dots to the square inch.
The result with this was a very slight
reduction of the vision both distinct and
near. When a dot was presented before
the pupil the effect was the same as in the
first test, only more marked.
A black dotted threaded net was used
for the next experiment, with dots a quar
ter of an inch in diameter and numbering
nine to the square inch. "With this,"
Dr. Wood says, "the distant visual acuity
is reduced from two-iifths to one-fifth,
and print to from small pica to great
primer according as the object is seen
'through' the open meshes or '..round' a
spot. All print is greatly blurred."
The finest plain black Brussels net was
then tried with the result that the vision
was reduced to three-quarters and fine
print was blurred. Tiie same veil with
pinhead Jots produced the same effect,
but a test with plain black chiffon lowered
the vision one-half for distance and raised
the type for redding from diamond to
minion.
White veiling â or Brussels â net lace
with flower sprays four inches apart, was
used for the seventh experiment. There
were sixty meshes to the square inch, and
under this strain it was louud that pearl
type was much blurred.
Perhaps the eighth test was the most
satisfactory, from the view point of the
veil advocate. Single thread dotted square
mesh net was used. There were forty
eight meshes to the square inch, with dots
one-eighth of an inch in diameter and one
and a half inches apart. With this, the
vision was only slightly reduced.
The same veiling was used in test num
ber nine, except that the dotn were four
times as numerous, and the only difference
was a marked reduction in vision when a
spot was be ore the pupil.
Fine black silk net similar to that used
in the first test, but with a flower spray
three inches apart, produced much the
same reduction in vision, except that
when a dot was placed before the pupil
the sight was much more affected.

acid bath, the outlines of the sunlight's
art are apparent. There is the subject,
and there is the nose. The iatter has been
greatly reduced. Unfortunately, it might
seem, the contrivance by which the lens
was held in place is in evidence. ''Very
good," says the artist to himself; "I'll
make this party look as if that was the
nose of a real V nus." And that is ex
actly what happens.
Presently, in a day or two, the subject
returns to the studio for the proof, and
smiles with keen delight at what ia pre
sented for inspection. The faca has not
been changed, but the nose â well, that is
different. It is as nice looking a nose as
ever was seen beneath the shadow of the
Acropolis. This is one of the instances
where comparisons are odious, so far as
the original nose is concerned, and the
photographer wisely refrains from making
any. The person who has been photo
graphed is delighted. The photographer
receives liberal remuneration for the ex
ercise of his art. Every one is satisfied.
The same principle applies to the photo
graph of the hands and feet or the mouth.
Not that it is one of fas ion's recent dic
tates that a person's feet of necessity
appear in a picture, but it is gradually |
becoming more and more the case that
the swell youne woman loves to be photo
graphed in a costume so charming that
she want? it in evidence from the top of |
sixteen to the square inch was found to be
most irritating to the eye. The vision was
reduced to three-fifths, and minion type
was blurred.
There was only little advantage gained
from the twelfth and last experiment,
which was made with the same veiling as
used in the eighth test, only with larger
dots. It was noticed that with this the
vision was markedly reduced when a dot
was before the pupil.
Dr. Wood made the most careful notes
during his experiments, and after a
thorough comparison he reached the fol
lowing conclusions:
That every description of veil affects,
more or less, the ability to see distinctly,
both in distance and near at band.
The most objectionable kind is the
dotted veil, although the influence of this
variety for evil is more marked in some
samples than others.
Other things being equal, in undotted'
and unfigured veils vision is interfered
with in direct proportion to the number of
meshes per square inch.
The texture of the veil plays an im
portant part in the amount and kind of
eye strain produced by the veil. When
the sides of the mesh are single, compact
thread the eye is embarrassed very much
less in its effort to distinguish objects than
when double threads are employed.
The least objectionable veil is that with
out dots, sprays or other figures, but with
large, regular meshes made with a single
compact thread.
The results of these experiments have
aroused great interest in the ophthaluric
world and caused no little excitement
among the fair sex. Almost every spe
cialist seen on the subject, agrees with Dr.
Wood that the wearing of veils is most
injurious to the eyes. Some of them,
however, contend that a healthy eye in a
healthy body can resist the strain so long
as to render the danger almost inopera
tive, but even these gentlemen admit
not one person in a hundred, possesses "a
healthy eye in a heaithy body." All
agree, however, that if the eye is naturally
weak, or is weakened in any manner, that
the wearing of veils will be followed im
mediately oy hur'ful results. It is held
that hundreds of women are now suffer
ing from nervous disorders that are di
rectly traceable to their vanity, but it is
only fair to presume that they are also ig
norant of their folly.
It has been urged in defense of veils that
they are requisite to retain the hat in
place, to keep the hair in order, and also
to protect the face from direst contact with
the wind; but even If all this be admitted
the very charming tortoise-shell pin that
graces the apex of the golden hair that
does not hang down her back to the very
tip ot the â in the picture â tiny shoe that
peeps from beneath the skirt which is
nothing if not a la mode.
Now to have the tip of that shoe which
projects from beneath the skirt of dis
proportionate size would be shocking
indeed. So the photographer carefully
adjust bis microscopic lens and tha pic
ture is taken. The projecting foot is tinj ,
or at least it appears so.
Then there are the hands. It unfortu
nately happens that the young womau
who loot 3at life from the window of a
$100,000 residence often has much larger
hands than the girl who sells her what
she choose 3at the great store. Nature is
very queer that way and the respect that
slie ought to feel for the persons of tho 400
is not aiways in evidence. But the photog
rapher is more diplomatic than nature.
Unlike that good dame, ii he be a fashion
able he must of necessity please his
fashionable patrons.
The shopkeeper or professional man who
makes his customer look her prettiest, or
rather prettier than she is, id the one who
best pleases, and so, when the photogra
pher with his microscopic lens makes the
abnormal hand of his customer look as
charming as Cinderella's foot in the
famous slipper, he has achieved a finan
cial and artistic success.
No one, as stated, knows just who
learned of this clever plan to make what
seems to be a real photograph a gross flat
tery of nature. It cannot be called a
Yankee trick. English dames and damo
sels were, so far a 9 known, the initial bene
ficiaries of the new art, as it is now called,
and there are unkind people who say that
it is one of those inventions that is con
ceived by an English brain because of
the dire necessity therefore. However,
this is unkind and cannot be proved, at
least not offhand in a newspaper article.
However that may be, it is exceedingly
fashionable in England at the present
moment, and people who know say that
more than half the sweil femininity
which daily disports itself on Rotten Row
patronizes photographers who keep micro
scope lenses in stock.
Over in Paris, where no woman who
thinks anything of herself admits tbai
either her hands or her feet are other than
exactly of the right proportion, the pho
tographer's microscopic lens has met with
uistinct failure.
In the United States, and particularly
in New York, where the fad has taken a
very tirru hold, society has indorsed the
microscopic lens. Dame Fashion, accord
ing to our own interpretation of her ideas,
says there is no reason on earth why we
should not make ourselves appear as
beautiful as possible. Art and nature are
always supposed to go hand in hand, and
in the ca&e of the photographer's pictures
they are certainly doins just that thing.
It is claimed that every photo Tajjher
has to slightly alter the photographs of
his patrons, provided those patrons are
wealthy and the photographer is fashion
able. It does not do to let us see ourselves
always as others see us. Never a portrait
maker is there who does not appreciate
this fact. The most popular fashionable
photographer is 'he who, like ihe late
Sarony, always shows of us the very best
that nature put forward, and then helps
us out with a little art.
The photographer calls the aid he give*
to nature retouching. In our hearts we
know better. \Ve all know that not one
of us who has his photog aph taken .would
accept it from the photographer if every
blemish that the truthful piate shows
were allowtd to remain. Not a bit of it.
We may say that wo are not vain, and
that we must have our photograph "nat
ural. 1 ! Just the same, we are vain, and
we wish to look unnatural.
It is these truths that nave made the
secret of the photographer revealed in this
article so popular. It is the catering to
human vanity that makes the picture
ruaktr a leader among his fellows. He
must be an artist and one of the most
notable of the notables in Vanity Fair.
In London alone there are 2500 feather
cullers, 4500* artificial-flower makers and
4500 umbrella and walking-stick makers.
there seems to be no excuse for the folly
of reading through the unnatural screens,
a sight often witnessed in the railroad and
street cars.
There is another phase of yeil- wearing
which will perhaps command more atten
tion with a view to reform. It is the
effect of putting the "abominable obstruc
tions" on the faces of babies. All special
ists agree that this practice is almost
criminal if continued after a knowledge of
its ill effects. This, it may be said in
cidentally, is the reason given for the
statement that there are so few "healthy
eyes in healthy bodies," the seed of dis
ease being thus sown by thoughtless
mothers, who would invariably stop the
practice did they know the crime they
are committing.
To thread sewing-machine needles a

JKe First Official j<r\oWledge Made J\iblic of the Vast ar\d priceless
Qold Fields of the Y\jUoi\
f^LOSE to the waters of the Yukon
c River, in far-away Alaska, the
'Â» northernmost of Uncl-e Sam's pos
sessions,lies what the Government now pro
nounces the coming gol â -mining center of
the world. Here for the first time is told by
J. Edward Spurr, chief of the party sent
out by the Government Geological Survey
to thoroughly examine the goid fields, the
truth concerning what has hitherto been
largely veiled in mystery.
There is little about the country beside
its mineral wealth to invite. In the short
summer clouds of mosquitos descend on
the yellow land like the pestilence ol
ancient Egypt. In the Jong winter the
cold is so severe that mining can only be
carried on during the sunshiny days.
Yet Professor Spurr tells us in the accom
panying statement that this is a country
which for placer mining will exceed Cali
fornia's palmiest days. To gather the
gold, however, and wean it from the sur
roundings in which nature has placed it
much valuable machinery is necessary.
So it will be seen that it is going to be a
hard tight the seeker of wealth will have
who tries his chances with fortune in the
Yukon gold fields. This is what Professor
Sptirrsays:
"To the Editor: Much has been written
of late concerning the possibilities of
SCENES IN THE NEW ALASKA GOLD FIELDS, THE FIRST EVER PUBLISHED.
Alaska as a gold-producinp country. As
a matter of fact, the production of the
present year may be roughly estimated at
13,000,000. This amount, however, comes
from an immense region of half a million
square miles, or about a quarter as large
as the United States. Of the mines which
produce this gold some are in the bedrock
while others are placer diggings.
"The bedrock mines are few in number
and situated on the southeast coast, which
is the most accessible part of the Territory.
The chief one is the Treadwell mine, near
Juneau, and there arealsoimportant mines
Berners Bay, at the island of Unga and
other places. Most of these mines, how
ever, are in low-grade ore, and the pro
duction is only made profitable by means
of careful management and operations on
a very large scale.
"The placer mines are those which oc
cupy the mos.t prominent place in the
popular mind, since they are remote from
civilization and in a country about which
little is known, and which is, on account
of this uncertainty, dangerously attractive
to the average man. This gold-producing
country of the interior is mostly in the
vicinity of the Yukon River or of some of
its immediate tributaries. The most pro
ductive districts hitherto have been the
Forty-mile district, which lies partly in
American and partly in British territory,
and the Birch Creek district, which lies
in American territory. Some gold dig
ging? are also supposed to exist on Stew
art River and some gold has been shipped
from the Koykuk. During the latter part
of the past season diggings were also found
on the Klundek and Indian rivers, near
Forty-mile.
"Another place concerning which there
have been many vague rumors of gold,
causing a stampede of many ujnDrepared
and unfitted men, is the Cook Inlet
country, which lies on the coast above the
mouth of Copper River, a situation re
mote alike from the mines near Juneau
and from the placer mines on the 1 Yukon.
''In all this immense country over
which placer-di ging is carried on, or has
been carried on, I estimate that there are
about 2000 miners. They are mostly in
the Yukon districts. These districts lie
in a broad belt of gold-producing rocks,
having a considerable width and extend
ing in a general east and west direction
for several hundred miles: Throughout
this belt occurs quartz veins which carry
gold, but sp far as yet found out the ore is
of low grade, and a large proportion of
the veins have been so broken by move
ments in thb rocks that they cannot be
followed. For this reason the mines in
the bedrock cannot be worked except en a
large scale with improved machinery,
and even such operations are impossible
until the general conditions of the coun
try, in reference to transportation and
supplies, are improved.
"Through the gold-bearing rocks the
streams have cut deep gullies and can
yons, and in their beds the gold which
was contained in the rocks which have
been worn away is concentrated, so that
from a large amount of very low-grade
rock there may be formed in places a
gravel sufficiently rich in gold to repay
washing. All the mining which is done
in t is country, therefore, consists in the
washing out of these gravels.
"In each gulch prospectors are at lib
erty to stake out claims not already taken,
the size of the claims being determined
by vote of all the miners in each gulch,
according to the richness of the gravel.
The usual length of a claim is about 500
feet along the stream, and the total width
of the gulch bed, which is ordinarily nar
row. VVheu a prospector has thus staked
out his claim, it i* recorded by one of tlie
miners, who is elected by nis fellows in
each gulch for that purpose, and this se
cures him sufficient tit le. The miners'
laws are practically the entire govern
ment in these district?, for the remoteness
prevents any systematic communication
being carried on with the United States.
All questions and disputes are settled by
miners' meetings, and the question in dis
pute is put to popular vote.
"In prospecting, the elementary method
of panning is used to discover the pres
ence of gold in gravel, but after a claim is
staked and systematic work begun, lone
sluice-boxes are built of boards, thÂ« min
ers being obliged to fell the trees them
selves and saw out tho lumber with whip
saws, a very laborious kind of work. The
depth of gravel in the bottom of the
gulches varies from a foot to twenty or
thirty feet, and when it is deeper than the
latter figure it cannot be worked.
"The upper part of the grave.'s is bar
ren, and the pay dirt lies directly upon
the rock beneath and is generally very
thin. To get at this pay dirt all the upper
gravels must be shoveled off, and this pre
liminary work often requires an entire
season, even in a very small ciaim. When
the gravel is deeper than a certain
amount â say ten feetâ the task of remov
ing it becomes formidable. In this case
the pay dirt can sometimes be got at in
tbe winter season when the gravels are
frozen hard by sinking shafts through
these gravels and drifting along the pay
dirt.
"The pay dirt thus removed is taken to
the surface and washed out in sluices
when the warm weather begins. This
underground working is done by burning
instead of blasting and p eking. A tire is
built close to the frozen gravel, and when
it is sufficiently thawed it is shoveled out
and removed. The stripping off of the
upper gravels which have been mentioned
can be done only in the comparatively
short summer season when the surface
thaws.
"The ordinary method of getting into
the Yukon country is by crossing the Chil
koot Pass from Juneau, down the Lewes
and Yukon rivers to the gold districts.
The usual time for starting is in April,
and a large part of the journey is made
over the ice which fills the lakes and
rivers at this time of the year. By this
early starting a large part of the season
available for working is obtained. Not
every comer can fina new dicgings which
aie profitable, and many of them are glad
to work for wages.
"The ordinary wages in summer are $10
per day, but sixty days is considered about
the average number for summer work, so
tnat the total earnings are not so great as
will appear at first sight, ana the pros
pects for work during the remainder of
the year are slight. The journey over the
pass and down the Yukon is o c of great
difficulty and hardship, especially as all
supplies have to be carried along. The
puss itself is difficult to cross, the lakes
are subject to violent gales and there are
a number of very dangerous rapids. Once
in the country the newcomer finds himself
no more comfortable.
"During the summer season, when the
days sometimes are really hot, there are
swarms of mosquiios and gnats, which
have not their equal in the world, and
which are enough alone to discourage
most men. I have heard stories, which I
can readily believe to be true, of strong
and hardy men being so tormented by
these pests while on the trail through the
swamp to the Birch Creek diggings that
they broke down and soobed in utter
i despair. The method of reaching this and
25
other diggings consists partly in pulling a
loaded boat against a swift stream, and
often over rapids, and partly in trudging
through the swamp or over a rough moun
tain trail with a heavy load on one's bacK.
In winter the thermometer falls so iow
! that it cannot be measured by any availa
ble means. It. is certain, however, that
it reaches 70 degrees below zero. Daring
all this winter season very little can be
done, and as darkness exists most of the
time life often seems intolerable.
"The actual exDenses of getting into
the country are considerable. Indians
must be hired to do a part or the whole of
the transportation of supplies across the
Cbilkoot Pass at very high wages, and the
cost of the necessary outfit is in itself con
siderable. On arriving at the diggings
provisions are often not obtainable at any
price, or if they are to be had the variety
is slight. The supply is always uncertain,
depending upon the lateness of the spring
and of the fall.
"Owing to the difficulty in bringing in
supplied prices are very high at the river
posts, and much higher in the diggings.
The freight alone from the coast to the
diggings costs as high as 50 cents a pound,
so that when one eats potatoes at $1 a
pound and bacon at 85 cents a pound,
other things in proportion, the cost of liv-
ing is enormous, and even employment at
$10 per day for sixiy days out of the year
will not enable a man to grow rich very
rapidly. Even employment for wages is
scarce, there being several applicants for
every job. Owing to the high prices for
supplies, no claim that does not pay at
least $10 a day to each man working can
be worked except at a loss. Many compe
tent men who engage in mining here and
work faithfully experience failure and
are unable to earn enough to buy provi
sions.
"In such a situation it is very difficult
to make one's way out of the country, for
the journey up the river along tbe usual
route requires upward of thirty days'
hard work, and provisions must be bought
for the trip. The trip down the river and
back to civilization by steamer is very ex
pensive, and of late years the number
seeking to get out in that way has ex
ceeded the carrying capacity of the few
steamers. Last year fully 150 men who
wished and intended to leave the country
by steamer were unable to do so, and are
still there.
"Under the conditions which now exist,
there are quite enough in the Yukon dis
trict already, and the object of this article
is to discourage people from rushing there
without due consideration. Probably
99 out of every 100 men are unfitted by
nature for such a life as Yukon mining
necessitates, and bad much better never
make the attempt. The hundredth man
must be a miner and frontiersman by
nature, dtrong and patient, a hard worKer,
and a lover of a secluded life. Even such
a man will very lively fail on account of
the large element of chance, and the most
successful miner obtains only a few thou
sand dollars in profit after a number of
years' patient work.
"Any great increase in the number of
men going into the Yukon district would
De disastrous, on account of the strict
limits oi the food supply and facilities for
transportation. The result would be
famine, disorder and failure. Several years
ago this actually happened, when all the
Forty-mile miners were without food and
were obliged to travel down the Yukon
over the ice to St. Michaels in the dead of
winter, a terrible journey of nearly 2000
miles. At that time there were only a
few men in the country, but if the num
ber had been very much iarger, even this
resource would have been impossible.
"My general advice to the average man
intending to go to the Yukon gold dis
trict is â to stay out. Many men go there
every year and suffer hardship, lailure,
loss of capital, and sometimes health. If
any one undertakes the trip he should
take with him enough supplies to last as
long as he intends to stayâ one year, two
years, or whatever amount. He should
have money enough to last him into the
country and out again, if necessary, and
snould start early enough in the season
to enable him to return up the river if he
ntends to come out the same year, for the
facilities for transportation by steamer
are likely to be entirely inadequate.

THE
STAGE
"La Loie" Fuller's pantomime, "A Pa
risian Tragedy," might just as well have
been called "A San Francisco Tragedy,"
except that in this part of the world when
gentlemen tire of their wives they are not
in the habit of signalizing the fact by be
stowing upon them diamonds and boxes
of eorgeous apparel, each box accompa
nied by a photograph of the erring hus
band. In San P'rancisco when love flies
out of the window diamonds and impo/ted
eowns do not come in at the door. A
Californian who takes to coing home with
packages of compromising letters project
ing palpably from his pocket leaves
nothing for hi* wife to hope for, except
alimony. Loie Fuller no doubt had "from
the French" inserted in big letters on the
programme becatise she wanted the public
to understand it is in La Ville Lumiere
that compensations are provided for
broken hearts in the shape of diamonds
and fine raiment.
The first part of ti.e pantomime, in the
"slanguage" of the day, ''made me tired."
Who wants to dress with more than ordi
nary care, go forth on a damp an<i chilly
night and pay money at '.he box-office to
see a maid putting chrysanthemums in
vases, even if she does wear a rational
skirt and neat, well-nttin - gaiters? True,
we always havo some curiosity; not so
much as the press agents suppose, but a
certain languid interest In knowing
whether favorite accesses wear corsets or
rational waists, whether they eat candy or
chew gum, and whether they like
beefsteak with or without onions.
The first part of "AParisian Tragedy"
gave us a picture of Miss Fuller in the
intimacy of the home circle. "We saw how
she loafs round in a wrapper and sleeps on j
her lounge, we saw how she cats candy â I
perhaps she has lived in Paris too long to
chow gum â and she showed us the charm
ing way in which she whistles to her
canary and whiles away her time with
artless little dances, and she confided to
us (by ocular demonstration) that she does I
not wear either corsets or rational waists.
If welearned notbingelsefrom "A Parisian
Tragedy" we know henceforth that, who
ever tlse is imprisoned in whalebone and
buckram, La Loie's contour is entirely
au natureL
Somehow, in spite of these confidences,
the early part of the Fuller pantomime
engendered a tired feeling all over the
house. This ought to be a warning to the
paragrapher that the public is not so
much interested in the intimate details of
an actress' existence as people are some
times beguiled into believing. I do not
mean to imply that Miss Fuller and the
girl who payed her maid did not act well;
on the contrary, they acted so naturally
that people bÂ»gan to fidget in their seats
and think, "I can see a maid at work and
a eirl eat candy any day at home." The
interest of the pantomime began when
monsieur entered with his diamonds and
his letters. The actio:i at once stepped
out of the commonplace of everyday life
then, anu from that point until the fall of
the curtain Howard Kyle and Miss Fuller
owned the audience.
In his everyday speaking Dart? How
ard Kyle would be a much better actor if
he coul 1 be more honeyed in his ways.
He always gives me the impression of
being angry and tierce. When his lips say
to the woman, "D;arest, I adore thee,"
his manner cries out, "Ah ! if I had a club
1 wouldn't do a thng to yon!" As for
his bearing toward villains and subordi
nate characters, it is simply appalling in
us sternness. In the "Police Patrol," for
instance, Kyle was a sort of guardian of
the law who would strike terror into the
souls of hardened criminal"). Policemen
are not generally the bogey men that
nurses portray them to their charges as
being; but Kyle's policeman was So ter
rible in its awful severity that it would
have made the worst boy on earth quail.
It must have been on the principle of
"A rose by any other name would smell ns
sweet" that Tod Lonergan masqueraded
on the programmes of the Grand alt last
week as Howard Kyle. Even the best
informed employes of the house did not
seem to know that his goJfather and god
mother had inflicted upon him the name
of Tod â such an unromantic appellation
for a leading man. No wonder he was
glad to change his name with Howard
Kyle last week. Lonergan can act excep
tionally well, whether be calls himself
Lonergan or Kyle. He will probably be
heard from before long.
I sometimes wonder in what frame of
mind a playwright Bits down to pen a
lugubrious melodrama. Does he write
his most harrowing scenes in the delusive
hope that they will extract what Amelia
calls "the pearly fugitives," or does he
pile on the agony thickest when he wants
to raise a hearty laugh? Whatever the
playwright's intentions may be the
audienca persists in laughing where it
should weep, and if it has tears it never
prepares to shed them. Just about the
time that the hero of melodrama is being
led forth to die and the sweet, unsophis
ticated heroine is on the rampage from
agony and despair the audience is be
ginning to settle down to the good, solid
enjoyment of mirth and laughter.
"Across the Potomac" literally reeks
with war and gore, but the large audi
ences at the Grand last week persisted in

laughing at the wrong place. The houso
was in roars of laughter when the pale
and emaciated soldiers, Bwathed in blood
stained bandages, were being carripd
across the stave on stretchers, and when
the unfortunate Northern prisoner expired
in prison, after paroxysms of jeruorse and
physical agony, bis last faint words could
scarcely be heard for sounds of amuse
ment from all r^rts of the house. It was
ever thus in melodrama. I think that the
man who wrote "There is but a step from
the sublime to the ridiculous" must just
have come home from seeing a melo
drama.
Two medical students were sitting be
hind me at "Across the Potomac." They
proclaimed the fact before the curtain
went up by discussing a virulent case of
smallpox and the bacteria which had en
eendered it. No one but a young "saw
bones," as Sam Weller so picturesquely
describes doctors in herbe, would enliven a
theater with bacteria, and the students'
comments on the way the wounded suf
fered and died were audible and interest
ing. "He's a mummy," observed one
youth, as the Northern prisoner was lifted
on to tbe stretcher, rigid as a poker and
immobile as a marble statue. "Ain't been

glee at the glacial condition of the newly
made corpse. They had been previously
interested in the prisoner's desire to make
a confession, the said confession, as usual
ia melodrama, being an infallible symp
tom of approaching death. When Cap

raspberry jam and might have been hu
man gore, the students diagnosed bis cas<Â»
carefully â declared, from his speech and

pediment why he should not live to a ripe
old age. That is the disadvantage of be
ing within earshot of people who know too
much â they take the gilt off the gingei
bread.

the melodrama, and when he appears 1

tempted to steal away from Miss Beatrice
Lieb's declamatory performances, but she
appeared in such an entirely new and un
expected light in "Niobe" that I stayed
in amazement and admiration till the
cupids, who are chronically trying to hang
. hemselves with garlands of flowers on
the Alcazar drop curtain, descended to
rise no more that night. Miss L c-b's Ni
obe was altogether an ideal interpretation.
Like Rosalind, she is "more than com-
mon tall" and more than common good
looking into the bargain. As the ani
mated statue she looked so beautiful tnat
one could not help admiring the taste of
the connoisseur who gave thousands of
dollars for her in the marble and fell in
love with her when he beheld her in the
fl sb. A commonplace, end-of-the-cen
tury Niobe would hay* spoiled the play,
but Miss Lieb was classic in. her dignity
and grace. A few more hits like this and
she will make a name for herself.

Boycott or\ Foreigners.
In a letter recently contributed to the
London Referee, Henry J. Leslie points
out that henceforth English companies
will not be able to tour in America with
any profit or satisfaction to themselves.
He says:
"A certain society, called 'The National
Alliance Stage Employes of America,' had
a convention some time since, and passed
the following resolution: 'That on and
after January 1, 1897. only scenery painted
by members of the Protective Alliance of
Scenic-painters of America will be handled
by members of the alliance.' This is a
practical boycott ot all scenery painted

Leslie points out tn.it the contract labor
laws prohibit the bringing over of a stage
carpenter or property-man unless he can
be shown to be an artistâ a rather difficult
task â and he adds:
"Unless some working arrangement is
come to between the two countries it will
De impossible for English managers to
send out companies to the States equipped
with scenery and costumes from this r^de,
and it will never be worth their while to
have English productions prepared in the
States, as the cost thereof in most in
stances would be simply prohibitive."
In San Francisco this state of things
will not affect the theater-goer to
any great extent, but in the East it will
make a great difference in matters theatri
cal. Not only English, but French, Ger
man and Italian companies that carry
their own scenery will practically be ex
cluded from the country. There has long
been an agitation in favor of protection
for the. American actor, but no one
euessed that the humble scene-shifter
would step to the front and cut the Gor
dan knot. The costuraers now want to
take a hand in the business, too, and are
agitating for similar protection. As for
the managers, they are anything but
overwhelmed with joy at ttie scene
sbifiers' action, as they will henceforth be
shorn of some of their biggest attractions

Earnings.
It is stated on most reliable authority
that Joseph Haworth, who has left the
cast of "Sue" to appear wih Modjeska at
the Baldwin this month, is to receive
fSOO per weekâ exactly the salary lavished
by Oscar Hammerstein on the Cherry sis
ters. The Cherrys, however, are freaks,
and as such are able to command fancy
prices, but $500 per week is a big salary to
bestow upon a legitimate leading man. If
Haworth can demand and receive grand
opera prices, he would do well to think
again before going on a starring tour. It
is a fad, however, to star, and next season
Haworth is going the way of all leading
men, which in these days means he is to
star.
Haworth is Mme. Modjeska's favorite
Macbeth. She says c he likes him better
than any Thane of Glamis she has ever
played with. He has also portrayed with
success such n wide ranee of parts as
Richard HI, Rinaldo, Richelieu, Orlando,
Matthias, Malvoiio, Romeo, lago, Cassius,
Icilius and Claud Melnotte. His first work
Â«t the Baldwin this season will be as the
Major in "Magda."

A Western Kansas paper In dealing with the

The Lyceum Theater Company of New York
has produced with success a one-act play,
"The Wife of Willoughby." It is the work of
Theodore B. Sayre, a young New York jour
nalist.
Mrs. Humphry Ward, author of "Marcella"
and ofher noted books, is writing a play. One
of her novels, "MlÂ«s Breiherton," is supposed
to have Mary Anderson as the model of iv
heroine.
"A Stranger in New York" Is the title of
Charles 11. Hoyt's new comedy, in which
Henry Conor will be starred. It will have its
first production In Buffalo, February 15. Mr.
Conor is now en route irom Australia.
Iv "A Serlou< Tangle," which will be pio

One of these days the public may see Judith
cutting off Hnloferncs' head upon the stage â
that is, if Miss Olga Nethersole holds to her
present iniemnn, which is to take a London
theater next year and to produce thereat a
poetic playlet written a r ound this subject by

Bailey Aldrich, the author of "Margery Daw."
E. H. Sothcrn says: "I think If all actors
could study to make up as a lightning sketch
artist reels off his exact charcoal likenesses
there would be a systematic saving of vital
force and nerve power. I am not very strong,
atul by the time I am drrs<ed I am exhausted,
and it is only the elation of enthusiasm in
my work which gives me thÂ» strength to play
wellâ as well es 1 can. at least"
New York papers announce with creat en
thusiasm that Etmcs and Calve have at last
consented to sing together in the same opera,
and Melba and Calve on the same night. In
the midst of such thrilling lyric triumphs the
manager oficn has to borrow money to pay
his laundry bill.â St. Louis Globe- Democrat.
In a letter to the Washington Post Richard
Mansfield, while discussing a recent lawsuit,
says: "In the twenty odd years that I have
been upon the stage I have never seen an actor
or an actress, ignorant as they might be, who
did not know that the table and chair placed
down the center of the stage are absolutely
sacied to the management. When I was earn
ing mv* living in a subordinate capacity I
should a> soon have thought of sitting in that
chÂ»ir as I should have been guilty of keeping
my hat upon my head in church."
Ever since the death of Professor Herrmann,
the magician, persons in and out of the
theatrical profession have been speculating as
to the amount of the fortune he left to his
widow, Mme. Adelaide Herrmann. It was
known that the receipts of his tours for several
years haa been enormous, reaching in some
instances as high as $80,000 in a single
season. This fact led many to believe that,
despite his extravagant way of living, he must
have accumulated at least a quarter of a
million dollar*. Otners, however, who were
more intimate with his affairs, assert that he
had saved very little. It has come to light
that he left practically notning.

to the advance. - There were no Liverpool cables,

"All men," said the orator who refuses
to quit stum ii-spea king, "are born equal."
"Hold on!" exclaimed the listener.
"That may do to say on the sidewalk, but
I can't take it home with me. If I let on
to my wife that 1 thought our boy, whom
we've just christened Egbert, wasn't any
better than the red-headed twins next
door thera wouldn't be anything left for
me to do except to say 'farewell forever'
and live at a i.otel." â Washington Star.

MR. RIVERS WILL
OCCUPY HIS SEAT
Supervisor Wagner Must
Vacate the Place
To-Morrow.
Any Other Rule Would Be
Revolutionary, Judge Heb
bard Declares.
Attorney McEnerney Shows That an
Injunction Will Not Lie in
. Such a Case.
Supervisor Wagner's suit against Su
pervisor-elect Rivers came up before Judge
Hebbard yesterday morning on the argu
ment in regard to the injunction nitherto
issued restraining Mr. Kivera from taking
.his seat next Monday in the Board of
fcupervisors^
Attorneys Curran and Francoeur repre
sented Wagner, while Garret McEnerney
appeared for Rivers.
The motion under discussion was to
dissolve the injunction, which, if it re
mained in force, would prevent Rivers
'from going into office with the others who
were elected on the 3d of last November.
Mr. McEnerney argued that this being [
an action in equity, according to his un
derstanding oi the authorities Judge Heb
i bard, sitting as chancellor, had no
jurisdiction. To sustain this posi
tion Mr. McEnerney read from the |
decisions of a gieai many courts, State â 
and National. Mr. McEnerney also
showed that it is held that injunctions j
granted in political contests of this char- i
octer are void, and that wherever persons
have been arrested for contempt of court
for ignoring such restraining orders they
have been released on habeas corpus pro
ceedings.
Citing the case of Moulton vs. Keid (54
Alabama, page 320), the attorney read as !â 
follows:
A court of chancery is not the proper tri- '
burial for the trial ot h contested'mualcipal i
election when the charter or a general law .
proviili s lor .sucli contest, and it has no juris
diction to enjoin the person elected from using
tilioutc of election or from qualifying
and eiiteriui.' upon the <lu-ties of his office, al
though Mien relief is usked by an incumbent
under v former election nnd entitled to hold
until his successor is elected and qualified.
A dozen other decisions of similar im
port were quoted at length, showing; that
a cuiirt of equity will not take jurisdiction
of a case to determine, and Mr. NcKmt
ney closed with the declaration that Mr.
Wagner had not chosen the proper pro
ceeding for the purpose of testing "his
rights, if he nns any ; tlmt if he thought
he was entitled to the office he misrht be
gin mandamus proceedings to compel the
other members of the board to recopnize
his Tight to sit with them, orhemuht
piopcrly institute proceedings in quo war
ranto directly against Rivers alter that
gentleman had assumed the office to
â¢which lie was elected. To recognize any
other method of proceeding woald be in
deed to supplant the ordinary course of
the law by a veritable government by in
junction. The court was asked to set
aside the restraining order hitherto issued
at Mr. Warner's request.
Attorney George H. Franco^ur, in re
plying to the argument by Mr. Rivers'
attorney, said that he desirei to draw the
attention of tie court 10 the acts of the
Registrar of Voters, which acts he con
tended were not in accordance with law,
and because of their illegality the present
proceedings had been instituted. It was
generally admitted that the registration
law was a limitation on right of suffrage,
some courts having declared such a law
unconstitutional, and this law must be
liberally construed in favor of the voters.
As the duties of the Registrar arise solely
from the provisions of the statute the acts
ot the Registrar must be strictly limited
by those provisions.
Registrar Hinton had attempted to pro
ceed with the registration under the pro
visions of two laws that are entirely irrec
oncilable, namely, the regisiration law of
1878 and section 1094 of the Political Code.
The registration was opened under the
conditions prescribed by the statute of
1878, and bad devoted live days to pre
cinct registration, although the clause re
lating to precinct registration had been
repealed. This was regarded as usurpa
tion ol authority on the part of the Regis
trar. If he had a right to make thi Â» de
parture from the plain provisions of the
law he had a right to abolish registration
altogether. Mr. Francoeur contended that
there bad been Â»n invasion of the rights
of his client by the acts of the Registrar,
and that the election under which Mr.
Rivers claimed tbe office was void.
Judge Hebbard requested Mr. Francoeur
to address himself more particularly to
the question as to whether an injunction
would lie in a proceeding like the one at
bar.
A'ter further argument the court ren
dered a decision in favor of Mr. Rivers, so
far as the primary motion was concerned.
The Judge said:
"I wanted it distinctly understood that
in deciding this motion I do not pass on
the legality or illegality of precinct regis
tration, a 9 suggested by Mr. Francoeur. I
wish to pass simply on the technical point
as to whetner an injunction will lie in a
proceeding of this character. I do not
know what you would call this complaint.
It is termed a bill of equity by Mr. Me-
Er.erney.but no matter what it may be de
cided to be the result in the end is to de
cide who is entitled to the office of Super
visor, and it ultimately â¢will call in
question the legality of the en tire election.
On matters relating to the legality of tbe
election I would be disqualified to give an
opinion, as I would be a party in interest.
Therefore I confine myself solely to the
legal question in regard to the injunction.
"The authorities cued by the defendant
here are plainly to the effect that no
matter what are the richts of the contend
ing parties as to the office, this court has
no jurisdiction to grant an injunction. I
am obliged to hold tuat an injunction will
not lie.
"Such a proceeding as this was never
before attempted in this State so far as I
Know. To allow a person to continue in
office by means of an injunction like the
one attempted to be sustained here would
be highly revolutionary. Something simi
lar in the matter of relusing to vacate
office Wat attempted two years ago with
out legal process, when Mr. Haley refused
to give ud :he office of County Cierk to
Mr. Curry, who had been elected. Great
confusion In the courts and In the ad
ministration of public business resulted,
finch a thin;; is not contemplated by the
law. The injunction is dissolved."
As Judge Hebbard had refused to hear
the tr al of the suit on its merits it was
necessary to take the matter to a Judge
who was not elected at the last election,
and by consent of counsel the case was
transferred to Judce Sea well's department
of the Superior Court.

ut a choice. So an adjournment was taken
till Monday morning when a last effort
will be made to select this official. There
were three candidates in the field, but one
dropped out on the fourth ballot, leaving
a deadlock between the remaining two.
The board was in no hurry to settle
down to business and spent an hour in a
committee of the whole in secret session.
After an adjournment to meet in open ses
sion there was no appearance of a pro
gramme. Balloting was held on J. P.
Kincaid, Joseph Curlett and Daniel
O'SuUivan lor the office of superintendent
of construction ol the new high scnool.
The first three ballots stood three for Kin
caid, three for Curlett and five for O'Sul
iivan.
Director Ambrose moved that the can
j diriate receiving the lowest vote in the
\ next, ballot be dropped. Uis motion was
j carried, and in the fourth trial Curlett's
three votes went to Kincaid, and O'Sulli
van's remained at live.
Another vote was taken without chang
ing the results, and the board gave it up
in despair till Monday morning, when the
last meeting will be held.

Miss F. L. Soule, requesting that she be
assigned to a position equal to the one

The letter was reierred to the Classification
Committee.
The Committee on Judiciary reported
concerning tho proposed conveyance to
the board of a lot of land on Vermont
street, by way of compromise, that in its
opinion the offer should be accepted. But
in view of the fact that the transaction
cannot be completed during the lile of this
boaru, the committee recommended that
no action be taken and the matter be left
to the next board.
Another report was submitted by this
committee reearding the Lake View and
Sunnyside Improvement Company's claim
for rerit for property occupied by the board
at Sunnyside. This report was to the
effect that the Board of Education com
mence action against all parties claiming
the rent and the matter be referred to the
City and County Attorney.
The following recommendations wee

j That Miss Mollie Bradley, Miss Lizzie Cvr
Miss BeHe L. Semlar and Miss Phiiomena

Josephine Hutchinson Tells
About His Romantic
Twin Girls.
Replies to the Charges Made
Against H m by Mrs. Jennie
C. Eurnett
Helen and Catherine Frequented 8
Theater and Bcught Bouquets
for the Actors
Joseph W. Hutchinson has filed an an
swer to the accusations made against him
in Judge Seawell's department of the Su
p rior Court by his daughters, Helen and
Catherine, by their guardian ad litem,
Mrs. Jennie C. Burnett.
An effort, is bein : made to have the
court declare that Hutchinson is an im
proper ptraon to rear his own children.
In opposing Hutchinson's application for
the custody of his twin 15-year-old daugh
ters Mrs. Burnett alleged that he had not
treated the girls right; that he had, by
his harsh treatment, forced his daughters
to flee from him and permit'ed them to
remain away from his home several
nights, and that they lived and lodged
during said absence under the porch of an
unoccupied house on Mission street; thai
he had cruelly punished his daughters
and that he threatened to send them to a
Masrdalen r.sylum or refuge for fallen
women if he regained custody of them.
All these accusations are denied by
Hutchinson, and he makes a counter at
tack on Mrs. Burnett by declaring that
she is biased and greatly prejudiced
against him, so that she has attempted tv
destroy the dutiful affection which his
daughters ought naturally to feÂ°l for him,
and that she aspires to supplant him in
tiieir minds and hearts. If they prefer to
live with Mrs. Burnett, he says, it is be
cause their sentiments in regard to him
have been warped by her during the time
she has had them in her custody.
Hutchinson tells a very good story on his
own behalf and Incidentally relates some
striking incidents in the career of his pie
cocious offspring. He alleges that he sup
plied his children with a good home and
that i c never chastised them except when
j it was necessary to correct willful diso
bedience and to enforce proper parental
discipline. This parental authority,
I Hutchinson says, is sought to be usurped
! by the guardian of the girls.
Re avers that in 1895, when the girls
were 13 years of age, he was necessarily
absent from San Francisco and being a
widower left lii 3 family affairs in charge
of his eldest sou, arranging that a part of
bis salary should be delivered to his
daughters for the purpose of paying
household expenses. They reported to
him the amount they had so drawn, but
subsequently he ascertained that their
statements were false, lor after an absence
of three months be was informed that his
entire earnings had been drawn by his
daughters. He learned that the girls had
squandered $(J4, for which they had not
accounted, and that this money they had
expended for box seals at a local theater,
for Douquets for presentation to such act
ors as pleased their fancy and for the pur
chase of confections and other refresh
ments obtainable at the cafe connected
with the Theater; that they bought
bronzed ties with fancy trimmings and
tintypes of themselves to be distributed
amonc acquaintances formed at the the
ater which they frequented.
Touching the accusation that he bru
tally punished his daughters, Hutchinson
explains that some one abstracted from
his room a lady's small gold watch, and
on account of the previous bad conduct of
Helen and Catherine he suspected them.
When questioned both of them denied
knowledge of the whereabouts of the
watch. Because of their untruthtulness
on other occasions he discredited tneir
statements and whipped them, bat not in
a cruel manner. He says that, on the
contrary, ne used only as much severity
as was necessary and right in order to
maintain his paternal authority.
So fur as the actions of the girls in sleep
ing under the porch of an unoccupied
house are concerned, he attributes that to
the romantic and melodramatic ideas that
they got into their heads by their three
months' constant attendance at the thea
ter, and he thinks that they used his well
established credit at thecorner grocery
near his residence to obtain the crackers
and sardiues requisite for keeping up this
gypsy-like existence â not becauss they
were afraid to return home, but because
such a course comported with the tragical
and extravagant notions imbibed by them
dunnir the time that they were associat
ing with acquaintances at the theater.
He concludes by averring that he desires
to regain custody of his children in order
that he may have tlieir companionship in
a good home which he, a skilled ma
chinist, is able anil willing to provide.
Judge Seawell will call the case for pre
liminary neanng to-morrow morning, at
which time it will be given a place on the
calendar for trial.
