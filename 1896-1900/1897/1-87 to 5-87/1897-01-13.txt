VOLUME LXXXI.â NO. 44.
SCENE IN THE SENATE CHAMBER WHEN SENATOR MOREHOUSE WITHDREW THE NAME OF SAMUEL M/ SHORTRIDGE
PERKINS RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 12.â Senator
George C. Perkins was to-day elected to
succeed himself as the representative of
the State of California in the Senate of
the United States for tba next six years.
(The opposition to Mr. Perkins was short
tut strenuous, the only recognized com
petitor of the successful candidate being
Samuel M. Shortridge, whose ultimate
withdrawal from the race was made in the
aame manly and courageous manner that
bad characterized his entry into the ex
alted political arena and his conduct and
methods while the battle was in full swing.
He entered the struggle on the solicita
tion of his friends in the hope that his
candidacy and success would tend to har
monize party differences, and aid in main
taining the high prestige of the party
whose welfare he always has at heart.
. Senator Perkins entered the contest with
all the prestige and power that Hows from
incumbency in office, and that office one
endowed with great potentialities in the
Ehspe of patronage of influential and re
munerative positions. But, determined
to leave no opening for po-sible deleat,
every convention held for the purpose of
nominating Kepublican torfelaton
throughout the State felt the influence of
the efforts of the friends of the incumbent
Senatorial aspirant. In addition to these
precautions, personal solicitation was not
disdained, by the candidate and by his
friends. The result of this plan of cam
paign was a thoroughly organized and
i compact contingent of legislators who
I went to Sacramento pledged to vote for
Xthe man who appeared to be the choice of
their constituents. Then followed the
caucus, and here the bonds that held these
men 10 Senator Perkins were strengthened
and his voting power was possibly aug
mented.
For some time past the name of Samnei
M. Shortridgo had been mentioned /or
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
1 [ this high position, and be was at this <es
j sion of the Legislature finally induced by
! his friends to permit his name to be pre
sented as a candidate to succeed Senator
| Perkins. He did not, however, decide on
j this course until very recently.
It was believed by many of the promi
nent leaders of the Republican party of the
I State that Mr. Shortrid^e's name submit
ted at this time would harmonize and
! unite the party. â¢ His well-known loyalty
j and fi lelity to the principles and the cause
of the Republican party it was calculated
well fitted him as a proper leader, and one
I who would be able to bring together thÂ»
various conflicting elements which had
I shown themselves during the recent elec
j tion. This was one of the strongest reas
ons for pertaining his name to be used.
Many leading Republicans believed,
| also, that the time had come in the his
| tory of the party when the younger men
| should come more prominently to the
front in California. There was also a
feeling throughout tlie State tbataman
of ihe weli-known attainments and abii
: ity of Mr. Snonridjje, with his superb
| oratorical powers and his other well
'< known qualifications for the exalted posi
! tion of United States Senator, should be
â  sent to Washington.
But when the gallant and loyal friends
! who came to the support of Mr. Short
! ridge â and they were numerous and bailed
! from all parts of the Stateâ found that the
â  â¢ fforts put forth by the followers of Sen
ator Perkins had pledged numerous r*p- !
j resentatives, who, if left to their own dis- j
cretion, would have given their support
to Mr. Sbortridzr, tuey realized that a
bitter struggle might be precipitated.
After, therefore, fully considering the
matter it was decided best, in the interests
of the party and of the future of Mr.
Shortridce himself, not to present his
name formally to the Legislature. This J

action having been determined npon, it
naturally left Mr. Perkins in undisputed
possession of the position.

From the Contest.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 12. â A
United States Senator is one of the high
est officials known, to the Government.
Hence the law has guarded (he method of
his election most jealously. The dignity
of the position, the exulted character, the
superior attainments and the general
moral and mental makeup of the man
thus honored are subjected to the crucial
test of investigation and criticism.' After

- To . Hon. George C. Perkins,; Washington, D. C: ;
I heartily congratulate you upon your re-election : to v the : Senate,
and trust you may have a continuance â¢of health and strength, to
labor for ; California and all her people. â¢ â¢ ; - :

a man has attained to that high office this
test becomes tess severe and he i 3 enabled
to maintain his prestige and his power
through the persons whom he has placed
in offices of trust and emolument. But
the chief quality desired in the person for
a United States Senator, and in fact in the
person of any other officer, is that he shall
represent the best qualities of his State.
Hence the election of a United States Sen-;
ator is regarded as a solemn event and the
procedure has been invested with all dig-
nity and deliberation that the law can
confer upon It.
That is why there was such a great
crowd in the Senate and the Ass mbly
chambers, but the Benate being a more
dignified body the visitors represented
more of tbe well-to-do and fashionable
element of society. Although the law
had fixed the momentous hour for noon,
ladies and their escorts Degan filing into
the chambernt 11:30 o'clock. Colonel Isaac
Trumbo, miner and National politician,
sat beside Senator Maboney; Charles M.
Shortridge sat with Senator Androus and
wore a red camellia in his coat lapel; Mrs.
Trumbo sat at the desk of Senator More
house; Mrs. Bulla was beside her hus
band, the Senator from Los Anpeles;
| Daniel M. Burns occupied a cbair at the
desk of Senator Bert. There were also
present of the notables Taylor Rodgers of
San Francisco; Ed McCabe, private secre
tary of the Governor; Miss Josephine
Todman. executive secretary of the Gov
ernor, and many others from Sacramento
and neighboring towns. The plush chairs
â¢ inside the rail were occupied by the fair
est of Sacramento's daughters, and in the
i gallery the dark clot, es of the men were
: relieved by the bright dresses of a score or
more young grammar-school girls who
I had received a tip from their teacher to
! attend the Senate and see how United
States Senators were made.
When President pro tern. Flint an
nounced that the next business was tne
election of a United States Senator the
buzz of conversation ceased and necks
were craned forward to see what would be
done next. After a pause that made the
i people think of a stage-wait or a hitch in
I the scenery. Senator Stratton arose and
â¢ made a speech eulogizing Senator Perkins,
the incumbent of the office. Stratton is
an ener?etic-looking man, with a piercine
black eye, and his appearance would lead
one to suppose that he was full of fire and
ginger, but to the disappointment of his
hearers a tamer speech was never delivered
in a public meeting. His utterance was
rapid and he expressed as much sentiment I
as a clerk reading off the inventory of a gro- i
eery. The speech was cold and colorless. I
like the subject, and there was no sugges- J
tion of inspiration in it. His remarks as i
to Mr. Perkins' ability sounded like a half- '
apolosy for his shortcomings, and the i
speaker took particular pains to impress!
upon h s hearers the fact that the subject i
of his praise repre ente I the business ele
ment of tne State and that the lawyers
were represented by Sena'.or White, who
unfortunately happens to be a Democrat.
Buila fullowe t in a more eloquent strain
and dwelt on" the fact that the Senator was
at one time a boy, and a poor boy at t; at,
| and he seemed to maKe a virtue of it, just '.
! as though Mr. Perkins had been born rich
and hau voluntarily embraced poverty for |
it* own sake uix' in oraer that there might '<
be some material tor a eulosy wneu he j
i should grow up aiid be a man and run for {
I the Senatotship.
Tiie Senate and visitors listened with
attention and coldly to the speech and
after its conclusion gave a spiritless round
of hand-clapping.
When Senator Morehouse arose for the
purpose of withdrawing the name oi Sam- 1
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
uel M. Shortridge from the contest in th â¢
interest of harmony in the ranks of the
party there was a revival of interest not
observed during the delivery of the per
functory speeches on behalf of the man
who had so much patronage to bestow
and whose frown could carry with it dis
astrous political consequences to the per
son at whom it was directed. Senator
Morehouse has a fine presence and a rich,
deep voice, and the stillness that pre
vailed waÂ»a high compliment to the repu
tation he has made as a political speaker.
But his hearers were disappointed. His
remarks were few and to the point. They
conveyed the intimation mat two years
hence he vould have the pleasure of nom
nating Mr. Shortridge for the honorable
office of United Siates Senator. The
warmth with whici his remarks were
greeted showed that there was some mag
netism in the speaker and the subject
alise.
When Senator Maboney's name was
called on the rollcall, he cast his vote
loudly, clearly and deliberately for Daniel
It. BurnÂ«. The unexpectedness of the
vote caused a buzz of surprise among the
Senators and spectators alike, and when
Mr. Burns saw that he was the mark for
all eyes, he blushed to the roots of hit
blush-colored hnir and waved his hand to a
Senator who was qn.zzing him. Senator

Maboney was the only Republican who
did not vote for Mr. Perkins.
The Democrats had a free and easy and
divided up among several candidates,
none of whom had been placed in nomi
nation.
Jolm Joseph Dwyer, Billy Foote, Sen
ator Landlord and Charles D. Lane of the
Silver Committee, received the compli
mentary vote of the Democracy. So it
was settled that George C. Perkins was
the choice of the Senate, and over in the
other side of the building the Repub
licans in the Assembly were doing the
same thing, and Mr. Perkins' friends were
sure at last t^at Colonel Jackson and the
other colonels were about to get collector
ships of the port and other fat plums of
Senatorial patronage.
IN THE SENATE.
Samuel M. Shortridgs Withdraws
From the Contest in Favor of
Senator Perkins.
SACRAMENTO, Cal , Jan. 12.â After
President pro tern. Flint had announced
that nominations for United States Sen
ator were in order Senator Slratton of
Alameda arose and said:
Throughout the middle part of last year tne
Republicans of California field county and
district conventions and, among other things,
nominated candidates for the Assembly and
for the State Senate. An important issue
which confronted the people ana which was
reflected in resolutions and platforms was the
election by the Legislature of a United States
Senator. In this latter regard it was deemed
proper by Republicans in answer to popular
demand to express their preference.
Ash result of the issue presented there has
been elected this Senate. But one name was
prominently before the people for Uniud
States Senator, and wherever the Republicans
of this State in county and district convention
have expre^seda preference by which to guide
the vote and the choice of their representa
tives they have, whether those conventions
were held in the north or in the south,
whether they represented the miners or the
farmers, wherever over the length and breadth
of this great State a choice has been thus
manifested for a United States Senator, that
choice without an exception has been indi
cated in favor of Hon. George C. Perkins.
If any Legislature through its acts should, as
it ought, reflect the will of the people, then
this Legislature, and this Senate, as a co
ordinate branch thereof, should give its un
qualified support for the great office of United
States Senator to George C. Perkiqs.
Tiiere never was a doubt from the time when
he returned to this State from the scene of his
labors in Washington but what the choice ot
the people was in favor of Mr. Perkinsâ a
choice solemnly declared in convention and
solemnly ratified at the polls.
Many in this State, of calm ana mature judg
ment, favor the election of United States Sen
ators by a direct vote of the people. The sub
stitute method of instruction to legislators ap
proaches as nearly as possible to the adoption
of that great principle, and even those who
may not be bound by any expressed wish of
their constituency are nevertheless privileged
to know and to feel that he is the choice of the
great masses of this State.
Nearly four years ago Governor Perkins was
appointed as a United States Senator to fill the
vacancy caused by the death of Hon. Leland
Stanford. I well remember that upon that oc
enslon in Oakland a meeting was held wherein
speeches were made congratulating Mr. Per
kins by reason of this great honor.
I lelt then that it mattered not bo much
what was said about him then, but what
would be said of him when his term of office
was done. The test after all must be not what
is said of the candidate before he has entered
upon his duties, but what is the verdict of his
constituency when he has returned from the
accomplishment of his labors. Senator Per
kins lias stood this great test.
This may have been regarded as a period of
probation for Senator Perkins. The high esti
mation in which he was held by his State and
v is party was, two years later, shown in his
election for the unexpired term. He has no
longer been upon probationâ he has taken his
place in tne Sen&te of this country and has
gained for himself a high position in the es
teem *nd in the confidence of his fellow-legis
lators in that grand body.
There are menintlie S-.nate of the United
States who are great jurists, others who are
great diplomats, others who are more or less
representative of the vital interests of the Na
tion. This State itself is represented from the
south by a lawyer, but Mr. Perkins stands as a
representative not so much of diplomacy or
of the law, but he stands as a representative
business man on behalf of the commercial and I
mercantile interests of the State of California.
I bs.ieve that it is a magnificent thing to
have in the Senate of the United States a sound
business man, who hag a practical acquain
tance with the necessities of the Nation aud
with her great industrial affairs.
Hitnerto it would seem to iiave been the
practice in many Slates, and in California par
ticularly, to send millionaires to the United
States Senate. There have been Senatorial
contests which have gone down into history,
which have properly provoked a demand by
the people for a constitutional amendment
which will give to them a direct choice.
The politics of this State, however, have in
the last two Senatorial electioas been elevated |
by the selection of the incumbents in the I
United States Senate, and Mr. Perkins stands,
together with Mr. White, representative of a
new time and of a new era, when not only
wealth, but merit, prevails.
We in A amada County justly feel proud of
Senator Perkins. Many factors contributed to
the remarkable expression of the popular will
in favor of Republican principles in that
county. Not the least of the influences was
the fact that the legislative ticket embodied
in itself the avowed candidacy of our towns
man and fellow-citizen, Georse C. Perkins, for
United States Senator. He is peculiarly a man
of the people, and ig properly the champion

plain, common people, whom Lincoln eaid
that t-ie Lord must love because he made so
many of them.
Although he is an employer of labor and a
manager, and in control of great shipping in
terests, still in thii State the voice of his em
ployes has never been lifted in complaint
against him.
He was not born rich, but he earned and '
acquired his position. Mr. Perkins begi.n life
a poor boy. He to that extent embodies in
himself something of the meaning of Gar
field's remark when he said that he never met
a ragged urchin but what he felthJ might owe
him a salute, for he knew not what possibili
ties for the future were in him.
He has energy and intelligence and this has
been shown by his career in the Senate. Mr.
Perkins has made a record of which not only
he but the State which he represents may well
feel proud.
Eastern commonwealth* maintain their pre
eminence in Congress by returning time and
time again their representatives who have ex
perience and position. California may well
profit by their example in according a re
newal for six years of the term of office to Mr.
Perkins as their representative.
This man of whom I speak does not parade
his virtues, and yet he is t>opular because he
has charity and because he has liberality â a
liberality and a charity which are not dis
played before the public of munificent gifts,
but by the continued and ever-Increasing sub
stantial kindnesses which have gone out from
him to his fellow-raeu.
California is a great State. It has many in

the mines of this State, which pour forth their
mineral wealth into the â  hannels of trade, be
cause he once workea in them. He loves the
great agricultural regions and the valleys of
this State, because he has seen their growth
and has had a part in their development. He
loves the cities of this State, because he has
seen them expand from villages into great
municipalities. He loves the north ana he
loves the south as well, for the reason that they
play a clorious part in the greatness of Cali
fornia to-day and because there are romantic
associations of the pa*t with the present, of
the did times of quietude and peace, of the
ranch and mission days in Alia and in Lower
California, regarding which General Vallejo
wrote in the Century Magazine some years ago.
' As legislators, let us understand that in this
matter we arc charged with a high and sol
emn trust. Let us further understand that as
to this our duty ends in the election of a Uni
ted Stales Senator, and he on his part there
udoii stands charged with all of the responsi
bilities of his position. Our choice then should
be in favor of one who is worthy of the honor,
who has integrity, ability, and who can fitly
perform his part in carrying oÂ«B and perpetua
ting the principles upon which our Govern
ment is founded.
Let us further understand that the Repub
lican party by its successes is committed to
certain great principles, not in the old plat
forms and the old issues, for they have passed
away. As an organization, however, we have
made promises to the people of this State, to
the people of this coast and to the people of
the United States.
While I speak as a legislator, and not as a
partisan, still believing, I may affirm, that the
Republican parly to which so many of us here
belong has, for over thirty years, redeemed
every promise, its every prophecy has been
fulfilled, and it stands to-day before the Na
tion and before civilization with its integrity
unquestioned.
The duty, then, of our Senator at Washing
ton wlil in a great part be to perform our
promises, to do as the party has done in the
past, have its platforms pass into history, nave
its declarations pass into precedents and find
their way into constitutional amendments
and statutory enactments. But if George C.
Perkins is, as he must be, elected a United
States Senator, it will not be as a Republican,
nor on behalf of thj Republican party, but it
will be as a Californian and as an American.
Then and now we with our Sinator wiil be
only citizens of one commonwealth, united
against common dangers, standing upon a
common platform, and advocates of a common
cause, and that cause advancement, success,
prosperity, humanity ana a higher and a
grander civilization.
Let us now, casting aside partisanship, be
lieve that we are on the threshold of a great
National career, and that we point now to the
star of hope ior American manufactures, for
American labor, for American commerce, and
the completed grandeur of th^ American peo
ple as a whole.
While I would like to see the career of our
party perpetuated, still 1 would far more and
beyond this see the glory of California and the
United States and the glory ana happiness of
our people perpetuated and advanced, regard
less of party.
Holding as I do these views, believing as I
do in these principles, having as I have a su
preme confidence in the man of. my choice, I
nominate for the high office of United States
Senator from the State of California the Hon.
George C. Perkins.
Senator Bulla of Los Angeles was the
next speaker. The Senator told of Mr. Per
kins' early strangles in life, and highly
complimented him on. his integrity.
In seconding the nomination, Senator
Balla said:
I desire to second the nomination of the
distinguished gentleman whose name has
been so ably presented by the eloquent Sena
tor irom the Twenty-seventh District. In
doing so I shall attempt no eulogium upon
his life or character. He needs no such ser
vice at my hand- b'forc this assemblage or
he peop c of the State of California, for vast
as is the area of our great commonwealth,
there is within its confines no hamlet so re
mote but that the name of George C.Perkins
is a household word therein. In every com
munity ther: are men who, by their industry,
foresight and sound judgment, rise above the
commonplace of â¢ their surroundings and
achieve success in life, where men of less
ability and force of character meet only with
failure. Such men make history, and the his
tory of such men is the truest ana best history
of the time and place in which ihey live. And
in modern times at least there has been no
more unique or thrilling chapter of history in
dited than that describing the experiences of
these sturdy pioneers who, almost a half cen
tury ago, left their homes of comfort or luxury
in the East and braved the hardships and
perils of a journey to the new El Dorado
which had been discovered on the broad Pa
cific. Humor, pathos, burlesque and tragedy
were all enacted in the lives of those men,
and we Califomiaus ot to-day who are enjoy
ing the marvelous results of their courage
and determination owe them a debt of grati-
tude which has b en but scantily recognized
and which can never be repaid.
Among those hardy men there came some
time in the "fifties" a penniless youth from
the rugged and rockbouad shores of Maine,
fired with ihe persistency of purpose and de
termination of character which are the heri
tage of every New England boy. I need not
recount the event* of his life from the time of
his arrival in California to the present. They
are a part of the every-day history of his
adopted B'.ate. As newsboy, clerk, merchant,
miner, legislator, Governor and United States
Senator his nnme is identified with every step
of progress and advancement in our wonder
ful Stateâ material, social, educational and
politicalâ for the last quarter of a century.
Few men have had m> re varied experiences â
none has preserved through them nil a more
honorable name or more unsullied reputation.
His holding of public office has always been
because that indescribable but all-powerful
ugency, public sentiment, has demanded his
appointment or election. Many of us who sit
In this chamber to-day remember well how
two years ago we were chosen as members of
the California Legislature upon the express
condition that our votes should be cast for
George C. Perkins for United States Senator,
and how, notwithstanding the most stren
uous efforts of other able and worthy aspirants
for the office, he was returned to the position
he hud so satisfactorily tilled.
And now, fellow-members of the Senate, It
again devolves upon us In our official capacity
to choose his successor in office. Personally I
hope some time in the near future to see the
intelligent people of our progressive State per
form this duty for themselves by their direct
vote, but at present we can only execute the
law as ii exists. But in this instance our duty
is plainâ our task an easy one. We are but
tlie representatives of those by- whose grace
we are here chosen by them under the law to
execute their will.
For myself, representing in part that rich
and rapidly developing section lying south of
the Tehachapi, I am left in no doubt as to the
wishes of my people. My instructions are
clear, definite and not to be disrettarded. In
many other districts the people have also
spoken in no less certain tone. But even
though there Had been no instructions to a
single member here, there would be no room
for honest doubt as to the choice of our people
for United States Senator. It is ascertain as
the sun will continue to shine in the heavens
that if the election of United States Senator
could be submitted to a vote of the people of
this State to-day the Hon. George C. Perkins
would ba chosen by an overwhelm ing major
ity, and "the people" are always to be trusted.
Thank God, the old adage, "Vox populi, vox
Dei." is still true in our great Republic, and
God forbid that it shall ever ceaie to be true,
lor when it does then will government of, for
and by the people perish forever from the face
of earth. Fellow-Senators, let us heed the
voice 01 our people and execute their will by
casting our votes for the re-election to the
Uniied States Senate of the distinguished in
cumbent, Hon. George C. I'erkius,
Senators Gilette and Smith also sec
onded the nomination.
Senator Morehouse of Santa Clara took
the floor for the purpose of withdrawing
the name of Samuel M. Shortridge from
the oentest. He spoke as follows:
"I do not rise on this occasion for the
purpose of making a speech. Unfortu
nately that speech has been reserved for
two years. The occasion has arisen in the
ranks of the Republican party within the
last few days, which compels me to with
draw and not nominate my friend, Hon.
S. M. Shortridge. I had hoped that on
this occasion I might be permitted to pre
sent for your consideration the eloquent
young orator of Sun Francisco. I do not
propose to eulogize him, for a life that
needs eulogy is unworthy of it, and a iife
that requires a panagyric is unworthy of
my support and suffrage. His life and
record should stand as a monument for
themselves. But following out the will of
the Republican party and caucus I with
draw the name of the Hon. Samuel M.
Shortridge, and I second the nomination
of the Hon. George C. Perkins."
The roll was called witn the following
result: Perkins 27, Daniel M. Burns 1,
Charles D. Lane 1. B. F. Lnngford 3, W.
W.Foote 5, John Joseph lawyer 3XTotal 40.
Senator Mahoney voted for D. M. Burns.

the lobby spaces on the main floor of the
Assembly were occupied until there was
no longer standing-room. The aisles and
places alongside of members were filled
with ladies who had assembled at the in
vitation of Assemblymen to observe the
proceedings.
Colonel J. P. Jackson took a position In
the aisle to the left, rear of North of Ala
medd. Colonel Dan T. Cole was within
supporting distance.
When the hands of the clock indicated
ti:e minute of 12 Speaker Coombs an*
nounced that the time had arrived for the
election of a United States Senator to suc
ceed the Hon. George C. Persins.
.North of Alameda introduced the custo
mary resolution in accordance with the
law and the rules. The clerk read the
statutes .bearing on the subject. When
the perfunctory reading was finished the
Speaker declared that nominations for
United States Senator were in order.
Waymire of Alameda was recognized.
He spoke as follows:
Mr. Speaker: During the latter part of last
November, just before his departure for Wash
ington, the junior Senator from this State in
the Senate of the United States wrote me a
letter saying that he would esteem it a great
honor to be re-elected while attending to his
duties at Washington, asking if I thought be
could safely remain away and requesting me
to place bis name before this Assembly. I
answered that I thought he could be re-elected
without returning and that I would comply
with his request. I am here to keep that
promise, and I now place in nomination for
the office of Senator ot the United States for
the term beginning March 4, 1897, the Hon.
George C. Perkins.
Senator Perkins is too well known, sir, to
require any eulogy from me. Though still in
the prime of life he has for a generation been
an active and efficient agent in the upbuild
ing of this great Commonwealth. Coming
here in his early youth as a sailor-boy, heat
once tound profitable employment in our gold
mines. Soon afterward he became a merchant
and prospered in that occupation. Twenty
eight years ago he was elected a State Senator
and served at the first sessiou held iv thin
building. It was then I made his acquaintance.
As the representative of a great jjurnal I
watched his work from day to day and learned
to admire the young man for his industry, for
his tact and for his genial disposition.
A few years later he removed to San Fran
cisco and, his heart still yearning tor the sea,
he became lame: v interested in the ocean car
rying trade. Under his skillful management,
his steamships plowed the Pacific Ocean from
Alaska to Panama. Ho became wealthy and
a power in the land. In 1880 the people of
this State made him Governor, in which office
be served with success and honor. Subse
quently, in various parts of the country, he
ventured upon important enterprises, always
maintaining a high standard of business in
tegrity. Four years ago he was appointed a
Senator of the United States to succeed the
late Senator Lelan<T Stanford. At the last
session of the Legislature he was elected to
serve out the remainder of the term. During
the late campaign he went before the people
of the State and made an open, manly contest
for re-eiection. The people seem to have indi
cated their desire that he should be returned
to the Senate for a full term of six years. It is
our duty and it is my pleasure to bow to their
will. In public life as in private life there is
nothing more sacred than a promise deliber
ately made. When given to the people by a
political party in its platform it must be Kept
or the people will lose faith in the party.
When given by a candidate for office to the
convention which places him before the peo
ple, or when given by the candidate himself
to the people who elect him, it must be kept
or the candidate will forfeit his right to public
confidence. *
Political parties are essential to good srcv
ernment. Good faith upon the part of public
men in their dealings with one another And
with the people is necessary to the mainten
ance of parties. Without strict observance of
it, no man can attain real eminence in public
life. I tru3t, sir, that the candidate whom I
named may be elected and that his services in
the Senate may be fruitful of good results to
the State and of consequence to himself.
The applause following Judge "Way
mire's speech was moderate and brief.
Judge Bridgford. Democrat and Popu
list, obtained the next recognition of the
Speaker and placed in nomination J. G.
Muguire. He said if the choice of United
States Senator was loft to the people of
California 75 per cent of the voters would
pronounce in favor of Maguire. "Only
yesterday Maguire removed from the
highway of prosperity one of the greatest
oDstructions."
N. Â£. Malcolm of Santa Clara seconded
the nomination of Perkins, using the in
gerÃOll speech of the Cincinnati conven
tion of 1875 as his guide. Malcolm spoke
of Perkins as a "leader of the leaders,"
and said the benator was noted for his
honesty in Butte County.
Sig Bettman of San Francisco, chair
man of the Committee on Public Morals,
assumed a superb oratorical attitude and
seconded the nomination of George C.
Perkins.
E. J. Eramons of Kern County nomi
nated Thomas V. Cator. He held it to be
a pleasant duty to represent the People's
party and present the narr.e of Cator to j
his fellow-members. He knew that many j
persona thousht that the People's party i
was composed of dreamt r.< and visionists,
but the waking day would come and the
country would see that the dreamers
were friends of the poor and needy.

Lalor to-night. The members of the com

Henry, Sanford, Mahoney, Tolan, Mead,
Dolau and Rubei. They worked in the
committee room while most of the mem
bers of the Legislature were jollifying for
Perkins at the parlors of the Golden Eagie.
Cleveland Dam, Chief Deputy of the
Commissioner, represented the labor
bureau, and Attorney Wentworth of San
Francisco represented many of the leading
employing agencies. Mr. McArthur spoke
for the Sta!Â« labor convention.
The first bill taken up proposes to es
tablish under the auspic s of the Labor
Department one employment aseticy in
San Francisco and another in Los Angeles.
An appropriation of $15,000 is involved.
Mr. Wentworth contended that the sen
timent of the taxpayers of the State were
against creating new commissions and
agencies.
Dam and McArthnr insisted that great
public benefit would result from the em
ployment of labor.
Incidentally it was noted in the discus
sion that the labor bureau, as managed in
the past by Tobin ana Waltz, was useless,
but under r the direction of Fitzgerald it
had gained the indorsement of the labor
ing clashes.
The Perkins colonels are having high

Fairbanks TUstanrrs the Field in the
ttrpubHean Caucus.
INDIANAPOLIS, Isd., Jan. 12.â The
: Republican caucus in the Senatorial con
test was held to-night. The last day of
the contest was productive of so much ac
tivity that it proved an interruption to
legislative business and neither house
held an afternoon session. The Fairbanks
people held a caucus at 4 o'clock to check
up their strength for the last time and
found that they had plenty and to spare.
The followers of McKeen, Wallace and
Taylor held a final caucus at 5 o'clock.
The first suoject discussed was as to
whether all the candidates should go be
fore the caucus. The decision was the
; san.e ti at it had been at all the caucuses
i ol the "field" held during the past weekâ
' namely, that the officers of alt three of
; these candidates snouid go before tbe
| caucus.
The McKeen caucus, in discussing the
quebtion of a secret ballot, took no action
on the subject, though many of those
present declared that if an open ballot
were forced they would walk out of the
caucus.
The Fairbanks managers determined
upon a plan of having a secret ballot,
with the reservation that any man who
cared to do so might announce his vote.
; The caucus got under way at 8 o'clock.
When it was decided to proceed with the
nomination of a Senator Senator Shively
offered a resolution that the vote be by
! secret ballot, each member depositing his
! ballot in a hat presided over by the chair-
I man and each member having the privi
lege ol announcing his vote as he cast it.
This wat> opposed by the opponents of
' Fairbanks, led by Senator Hubbell, and
the proposition was warmly debated for a
i half hour.
At 9 o'clock a vote was taken and the
i Shively resolution was adopted by a vote

of 52 to 33. Thereupon a bolt from the
caucus was led by Senator Duncan. These
Senators, and Representatives went to the
Senator cnamber and held a caucus tnere.
The main caucus immediately rescinded
the lesolution and sent three or four com
mittees in succession to the recalcitrant
member-, but they stayed out fully an
hour. Finally they all marched back and
alter some oratory was extended in pre
senting the names of candidates a ballot
was taken, resulting in the nomination of
Mr. Fairbanks by a vote of 60 to 25 for the
other three, divid das follows: McKeen

CANTON, Ohio, Jan. 12.â The Ohio
Presidential electors came from Columbus
and called on the President-elect formally
to-day. At 2 an elaborate lunch was
served. Before their departure the electors
were photographed with the President

General C. H. Grosvenor spent an hour
with Major McKinley this afternoon. He
said he did not know whether Senator
Sherman was to be in the Cabinet or not.
Colonel Allen T. Brinsmade of Cieve
lanrt, wtio is a devoted friend of Senator
Sherman, and who has taJten an active
part in the management of several of his
campaigns, publicly announces
to-day that he is orginizinp a movement
to secure the re-election of Mr. Sherman
to the Senate. The Legislature which
chooses Mr. Sherman's successor is to be
chosen next November, and the next Onio
Senator wih be elected in January next.
If Colonel Brinsmade's movement is
authorized it is not likely that Senator
Sherman will be in Major McKinley's Cab

CALLS MAGUIRE
A HUMAN HYENA
Grove Johnson Answers the
Speech of His Colleague
From California.
Exp'ains His Record in New
V rk and Says He Expiated
His Youthlul Cr:m.\
Bitter Slanders and Vile Caricatures
in Hearst's "Exam ncr" Caused
His B.ocd to Boil.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 12.â One of
the most sensational episodes that ever
occurred in the halls ot Congress was that
of to-day when Grove L. Johnson arose to
a question of personal privilege on account
of remarks printed in the Congressional
Record of this morning by Hon. James G.
Maguire.
The proceedings of last Friday, when
j Johnson during the debate on the Pacific
i funding bill took occasion to roast W. It.
Hearst of the New York Journal and San
Francisco Examiner are already known
10 Call readers. Judge Maguire smarted
under the accusation of Johnson that all
the California members (excepting Bow
ers) were insincere and dishonest in their
opposition to the refunding bill.
Judsre Maguire, as related in this morn
ing's Call, tried yesterday to secure rec
ognition as a matter of "personal priv
ilege," but was denied it by Speaker
ReÂ«d, on the ground that Johnson's ref
erences to Maguire did not warrant it.
Judge Mnguire was determined that he
woujd retaliate upon Johnson and punish
him for his caustic remarks made in the
House on last Friday. So he inserted in
this morning's Congressional Record,
under the "leave-to-print" privilege, an
pi ension of his speech of Saturday. He
alleged by innuendo that Grove L. John
son had been convicted of a criminal of
fense in New York State, and that he liad
&ougbt refuge in California, where he con
cealed his identity until the New York in
dictment bad been nolle prossed.
Grove L. Jonnson this morning received
a dispatch saying the Examiner nad
printed these remarks in full purporting
to have been a speech ultered by Judge
Maguire. Johnson then toos up the Con
gressional Record and saw the printed re
marks of Magaire. So, during the consid
eration of a bill in the House this morn
ing, he aro^e and demanded recognition
as a matter of personal privilege.
The Speaker denied this until the pend
ing business was disposed of. Johnson
resumed his seat. He was apparently
Vf-ry much agitated, and members of Con
gress, who always expect something in
teresting when a member of Congress
rises to a question of "personal privilege,"
faced Johnson and awaited developments.
Word was passed along the Capitoi cor
ridors and vacant seats in the hall of the
House were soon occupied. The members
had been anticipating a row between the
two California representatives, but they
were hardly prepared to witness the ex
citing scenes that followed. The corre
spondents, who were listening to Senate
debates, hurried to the House wing, and
soon the House press gallery was crowded
with newspaper men. Finally Johnson
â¢was recognized. His fare was pale nmt
he could not control his agitation. The
hall of the House was as still as death,
when Johnson arose and said:
Mr. Speaker: Last Friday I made some re
marks upon the bill then pending before the
House known as the I'acific Railroad funding
bilL la the comse of my remarks in order to
illustrate the weakness of the opposition to
the bill coming from California I uudertook to
state the real secret under y ing causes < f that
opposition, and I did it openly, bol'ily, know
ing whereof 1 spoke, and being responsible for
what I said. I was informed that the gentle
man from California (Mr. .Maguire) intended,
to assail me personally upon the floor yester
day, and to call me to Wccoun t for what I had
said, not wi'.h reference to himself, but with
reference to some one else.
1 waited here yesterday all day, though not
well, in order to be prepared far the "roast
ing" that I was to receive and to endeavi r to
reply to anything tnat might bo said. This
morning my attention is called to the Con
gressional Kecord. where 1 rind what purports
to be a speech delivered by the gentleman
from California, in which one whole column
is devoted to a bitter personal a.-sault upon
myself. That speech was not delivered upon
the floor of this House. That upecch was 'not
delivered anywhere, except b> writing it up
on paper, lumding it to the reporter and hav
ing it priuted in the Recora.
1 am hanaed to-day a copy of the St Louis
Globe- Democrat of Monday morning, in which
the correspondent of that paj^er says Mr.
Magnire is going to roast me; is going to al
lude to what has happened in my life; is
going to "cause Grove Johnson's skeletons to
be led forth" ; and he states what Mr. Maguire
says he is going to sny in reference to the
matter. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, this whs no
sudden burst of wrath. It was intended by
the gentleman from California to be given to
the people and to be given without allowing
me an opportunity to be heard; and to be
given in what it seems to roe is a cowardly
and unmanly manner. I would not, in order
to securo the success of any measure in which
I may be interested, assail a member of this
House in ills absence. Telegraphic advices
that 1 have received from California state to
me that William R. Hearst has already pub
lished in the columns of the San Francisco Ex
aminer the speech alleged to have been made
by Mr. Maguire upon this floor. In this speech
he makes % cowardly insinuation against me,
but has aot the courage to state it openly and
frankly.
It is true that thirty-four years ago I was in
trouble in the State of New York. It is true,
sir, that thirty-four years ago I was indicted.
It is true, sir, that thirty-four years ago I did
go to the State of California 10 endeavor to
rear a new home for myself. It is untrue that I
went there under any name except that of
Grove L. Johnson, as the gentleman from Syr
acuse iMr. Poole), who has known me from
boyhood, knows. I went to Sacramento. I
settled there in 1865 as Grove L. Johnson.
AYell knowing the charge against me, the peo
ple in Syracuse well knowing it and my resi
dence in Sacramento, I wonted in Sacramento
day in and day out, and by the blessing of
God and the help of my wife and through my
own labor I was able to pay back every dollar
of indebtedness that I owed in the city of Syr
acuse, in the State of Nev York. [Loud ap
plause.] Every charge against me was dis
missed. The very men that had suffered pe
cuniary loss at my hands were the first to con
gratulate me upon my success. And I visited
Syracuse in 1870 and nearly every yearsinceâ
always as Grove L- Johnson.
Now, while in Sacramento every man knew
me, they knew what I had done, but they
knew that I had tried to live an honest life in
California, and unlike this human hyena (Mr.
Maguire) they did not dig up the grave of the
past in order to injure my wile, my children
and myself, but they met me as one man
should meet another. During the entire cam
paign, from the very beginning to the end of
it, I was the recipient of the vilest abuse from
the paper conducted by this man Hearstâ the
vilest abuse that was ever heaped on a man.
That paper was filled with the bitterest slan
ders and the vilest caricatures of myself.
You know how our honored Speaker was cari
catured by that paper during the campaign,
because you were present and saw it. You
know hew bitter were the assaults that were
made upon him.
The gentleman from Maine (Mr. Boutelle)
knows how he was assaulted by ih.it imamous
paper, but the bitterness of tne assaults upon
our honored Speaker were but as drops of water
compared to the roar of the catarict oi
Niagara to the assaults that were made on me.
i am a man with all the sent.imuus and feel
ings of n niHn, and can stand a reasonable
amount of punishment, although I am not in
vulnerable to every shaft. But In addition
while my wife lay nick upon her bed during
the campaign, from which sickness the doctors
said she mignt not pernaps recover, this in
famous wretch sent cop c* of his paper to my
wife; and in order that she might be given the
agony of reading the abuse of her husband he
cut out the editorials and caricatures from bis
paper, put them in envelopes, sealed them
and sent them to her as correspondence, until
the doctor directed my daughters never to
give my wife a letter until they bad first read
it themselves to Know what was in it.
There is a race of men in Ireland called in
formers, in Italy called bravos, in Russia
called paid police spies; either one of those
would nave scorned to do what the gentleman
iroin Calif jrnia did with reierence tome. It
may be sa;d I assailed a man that vm not
present, and the gentleman irom Wisconsin
(Mr. Cooper) speaking oi it said I was cowardly
in assailing a man, who had assailed me for
more than a year, that lives in New York; that
is safely en.^coused In the fortress of his bouse
in New York; who sends his order 3500 miles
to California, to have me attacked, when I can
not reply nor see him. Is that cowardly? If
the gentleman irom Wisconsin thinks that I
am cowardly or if the gent.eman from Califor
nia things I am cowardly let either of them
repeat to me outside of this chamber what
they said In this chamber and their curiosity
will be appeased. [Applause.]
The physiologists tell us that man changes
every seym years; for thirty-four years J have
tried to make a living for myself, my children
ana my grandchildren, who have been born
unto me (and I have taken good care oi them),
and now, in my old age, when I can look back
ward, and not forward in life; when but a few
more years are given to me. when I ought to
be permitted to enjoy n few years of peace, is
it right that a man should go back thirty-four
years and unices the coar of the secret re
cesses of the past, to bring up the skeleion of
my youthful conduct before you and exhibit
to the people of too United States, and
especially in this sneaking, cowardly manner?
Ought not there be a statute of limitation 10
the past of mar.?
Mr. Johnsou's emotional delivery had a
must singular effect upon the House. It was
one of the strangest spectacles imaginable.
His seat was in the buck row, immediately to
the right of the center door. During his im
pnÂ»Hioiieii ispeacl),, nis body swayed, Mid fre
quently he ventured into the aisle, all the
wnile exhibiting signs of the greatest excite
ment. His boay lairly quivered and his voice
was frequently choked with emotiou. Several
of thoso nearsst to him rÂ«w tears hi his eyes,
or whether true or not, he certainly made a
very lachrymose, not to say tearful plea for
sympatny.
*At times Johnson appeared in a most ludi
crous light, but wheu, with his eyes in fine
frenzy rolling, he called upon heaven to wit
ness that he was a reformt-d man, the galler
ies broke into applause. Such is the effect ol
emotional oratory.
Meanwhile Judge Maguire, the sturdy,
sat in his seat, facing Johnson. His mouth
was tirmly set, and there was a dangerous
fire in his eye that boded trouble for his
adversary. Few men have seen the fat,
sood-natured Congressman angry, but his
feelings to-day was worked up to the high
est pitch. When Johnson ceased Maeuire
arose and said :
"I never printed anything anywhere in
my life, or asked another to print it, or to
say it, that 1 was not myself ready to sa%
in presence of any man on earth. On Fri
day Inst, on 3of tne most remarkable, out
rageous, malicious speeches that I eve
heard, or which was ever was delivered in
respectable assembly of gentlemen, wa
delivered by the gentleman from Call
fomia."
Judge Magnire then explained that on
Saturday he endeavored to secure recog
nition as a matter of personal privilege to
answer Johnson, but failing in this, bad
used the privilege accorded members to
print their remarks in the Record.
The gentleman need not concern him
self about my courage," said Maguire.
"Mr. Hearst is conducting one of the
greatest newspap?rs published in t!i.>
Enslish language." [Laughter.] Hoc 1 *
and jeers of derision on the Republican
side greeted this statement.
Speaker Reedâ The House will be in
order.
Matruire (resuming) â Ye 3, the greatest
newspaper published on this continent.
[Renewed laughter, which the Soeaker
repressed.]
Judge Magaire then took his seat and
was given a round of applause by the
Democratic sfde. It was evident, how
ever, that Johnson's tearful plea had won
the sympathy of the House.
Poole of New York, a tall, gray-mus
tached, one-armed veteran, speaking in
support of a motion to expunge Judge
Magntre's remarks about Johnson from
the Record, admitted that Johnson ha<l
been guilty of criminal conduct in Syra
cuse, but expressed the belief that as a re
formed man be was now respected in Cali

forma, .f oole's motion to expunge a par
ticular paragraph from the remarks of
Judge Maguire was carried by a vote of
190 to 67.
Towue of Minneapolis then moved to
expunge Johnson's accusations against
Hearst, made on Friday, as follows:
"We knew liiru to be a debauchee, a
dude in dress, an anglomaniac in lan
guage and manners, but we thought he
was honest. We knew him to be licen
tious in his tastes, regal in his dissipa
tions, Unfit to associate with pure women
or decent men, but we thought 'our Wii
j lie' was Honest. We knew he was erratic
j in his tastes, erratic in his moods, of
i small understandin,' and smaller views of
mpn and measures, but we thought 'our
Willie,' in bis English plaids, fiis cockney
accents and his middle-parted nair, was
honest. We knew he bad sought on the
banks of the Nil* relief from disease, and
had rivaled the Khedive in the gorgeous
ness of his harem in the joy of restored
health, but we still believed him honest,
though low and deprai^ed. We knew he
was debarred from society in San Fran
cisco because of bis delight in flaunting
his wlckednes?, but we believed nim hon
est, though tattooed with sin."
The House then refused to eliminate
Johnson's reference to Hearst by a vote of
94 to 8.3.
Judge Maguire's friends think that it
was unjust to expunge from the record his
remarks about Johnson while allowing
Johnson's accusations against Hearst to
stand. They say t; at the House was di
vided on party lines, and so it appeared
from the rollcall.
In all of the rolicails Johnson voted on
I his own side of the controversy. Judge
Maguire did not vote at all ; nor did Bow
ers, Barham or Loud. Hilborn voted to
strike out both references.
The end is not yet. It will not be "pis
tols and coffee for two," according to some
sensational rumors, for Judge Maguire is
too sensible to light a dnei, but he will
bring tne matter up in the House again
to-morrow, if, as reported, Poole of New
York has eliminated from his speech in
tne Record of to-morrow the paragraph in
which lie admits that Johnson committed
forgery in Syracuse, without eliminating
at the same time his allegation that Ma
guire had made false statements about
Johnson.
SPEAKER REED'S RULING.
Decides That the Motion of Powers to
Reconsider the Refunding Bill Is
Out of Order.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 12.â The
hope of those members of the Houso who
are anxious to secure some legislation
with reference to tbe Pacific railroads this
session was quenched to-day by a decision
of Speaker Reed. Yesterday Powers (R.)
of Vermont moved that the bill be recom
mitted to the Committee on Pacific Rail
roads, but objection was made that this
was not introduced as other businessdiad
intervened. Speaker Reed asked until to
day to render a decision. Soon after the
House met he stated as his opinion that
the motion of the gentleman from Ver
mont to recommit the bill was not in
order.
The motion, he said, could have been
made if the House had passed the bill to a
third reading or if other business had not
intervened. No demonstration lollowed
the announcement.
The bill to better define the rights of
aliens in iLe Territories, which was passed
over temporarily yesterday, was taken up
until call of committees and the bill was
passed by a rising vote â ayes 59, noes 26.
A bill allowing applicants for mineral
land patents to appear before clerics of
courts and notaries public making the
preliminary affidavit was also passed.
Bros. us (II.) of Pennsylvania called up a
House bill increasing the classes to which
preference shall be given in appointments
in the civil service. It provides that three
classes shall be disaoled Union soldiers
and sailor< of the late war, honorably dis
charged Union soldiers and saflors and
widows and orphans of Union soldiers and
sailors. The present law gives preference
to those Union soldiers and sailors who
were discharged by reason of wounds or
sickness contracted in service.
After some discussion as to whether
Btate troops might not be included in the
provisions of the bill, it was modified so
as to read provision to soldiers of the
United States in the war of the rebellion.
COMMITTEE VACANCIES TILLED.
Boatner Takn* the Mace of Critp on
WVij/ji an ft Meant.
WASHINGTON, D.C.. Jan. 12.â Speaker
Reed just before adjournment to-day filled
ttje vacancies in the committees on Rules
and Ways and Means, caused by the death
of the late ex-Speaker Crisp of Georgia,
by giving the place to Boatner of Loutsl
iana, whose seat was declared vacant at
the last se'sstou of Congress and who since
his re-election to fill out the remainder of
the present term has been without a com
mittee assignment. The vacancy on the
Rules Committee was tilled by the ap
pointment of Bayley of Texas.
Stokes of South Carolina, who, like
Boatner, was unseated last year, was as
signed to the committees on Agriculture
ana Public Buildings and Ground-*.
Charles Crisp, the son of the Speaker
Crisp, who was elected last month to serve
out the remainder of his father's term,
was assigned to the Postotfice and Mileago
Committees.
Jtangeroum Counterfeit Aolrn.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 12.â The banks
to-day received word of tha discovery of a
new counterfeit of the $20 United States
certificate, issued Tinder an act of Feb
ruary 28, 1878, series 1891, check letter
B. The counterfeit bears the usual small
scalloped carmine seal, purports to be
signed by J. F. Tillman, register of the
treasury, and D. N. Morgan, Treasurer of
the United States, and bears the treasury
A. 6,705,401. The most noticeable defect
in the bill is the portrait of Daniel Man
ning, which does not stand out in bold
relief as in the genuine, but appears
sunken in the background. In the coun
terfeit the nose appears sharp and pointed,
while in the genuine it is round and broad
at the end. There are other defects. The
counterfeit is printed on a good quality of
paper, but lacks the distributed fiber found
j in the genuine note.

INDIANAPOLIS, I.xa, Jan. 12.-Tbe
>ationai monetary conference called at
-uggest:un of tue Indianapolis Board
of Trade and composed of representa
tives of similar organizations from all
parts of the country assembled in Tom-
Imson Hail this afternoon. The arrange
ment of the ball was in general similar to
that of tbe gold convention heli in the
same place last September. The decora*
were much more moderate, however,
consisting of tbe National colors draped
over the piau'orm. There was a sprink
ling of spectators in the galleries and the
hour preceding the beginning of business
was enlivened by music.
The convention was called to order at
2:3o o'clock by Hugh H. Hanna, chairman
of tue executive committee, under whose
management tbe arrangements for tbe
convention were made ana who origin
ated the movement culminating in tbe
meeting to-day. He introduced Rev. M.
L. Haines, pastor of tne F.m Presbyte
rian Church, who opened the proceedings
with prayer. He asked that the result of
the conference might be even greater and
far-reaching than tne projectors even
dared hope for, and that tbe country
might be prosperous in the future as it
turret had ceea in the past.
In tbe name of t&e executive committee
Mr. Hanna extended a cordial welcome to
the delegates. They understood and appre
ciated the sacrifice made by business men
;n coming to tbe convention at this time
of the year.
J.W. Smitu, secretary of the Indianapolis
Board of Trade, read the call under which
:he convention assembled. The emphatic
terms of the call declaring it to be the sen
timents of the business men of the country
that they should take part in shaping the
financial legislation of the country and
that they would never agree to any propo
sition which would degrade the present
standard of values were received vita ap
plause.
Mr. Hanna presented the report of the
executive committee. Pursuant to the
resolution that was adopted at a pre
liminary conference, December 1, it is
said, the committee has sent out invita
tions to board* of trade, commercial clubs
and such lice organizations in all tbe cities
of the United States of a population of
8000 and greater, according to the last
census," requesting these to send delega
tions to tins convention. There are as
sembled here 300 delegates, representing
business organizations of cities in nearly
every State in the Union.
The committee recommended - for the
temporary organization a committee on
credentials, on permanent organization
on rules and order of business, each con
sisting of fi.teen members.
That all resolutions concerning the cur
rency and banking systems snd mode of
procedure shall be referred without deoate
to the committee on resolutions, to be ap
pointed by the permanent chairman.
That each delegate present shall be enti
tled to one vote.
For temporary chairman the executive
committee recommended E. O. Stanard oi
cretary Jacob W. Smith of
Indianapolis, and for btrgeant-at-arms W.
F. C. Goit oi Insianapoiiiv.
The committee on credentials reported
750 delegates had been enrolled, rep
resentinz the trade and commercial or
ganizations of the different cities.
The committee on rules and order cf
's= presented its report, the chief
feature of which were the provisions for
resiricting debate, tricking the extreme
limit for ?peecnesto na.f an hour and con
fining mort of them to five and tea min
utes each. It was aaopted.
The committee on permanent organiza
tion recommended the name d
Patterson oi Pennsylvania for president
and t .em for each State repre-
Wt..cleG of In
was named for permanent secretary and
Mr. â¢ iDt-at-arms. It wti
recommended that the other committees
Darned be continued.
Mr. Patterson was escorted to the plat
form by Messrs. E. B. Mar:.ndale and
H. H. Hanna of Indianapolis acd Mr.
Lowry oi Atlanta, Ga. He addressed the
convention.

Hon. J. H. Walker of Massachusetts,
chairman of the House Committee on
Banking and Currency in the present Con
press, was invited to address the conven
tion, which he consented to do.
At the conclusion of Mr. Walker's re
marks the convention took a recess until
8 o'clock this evening.
me evening session was called to order
by Chairman Patterson at 8:20. M. E.
lnzalls was recognized to move that the
committee on resolutions should be per
mitted to retire and sitdunng the session,
it was so ordered.
J. H. Rhoads was then recognized and
allowed twenty minutes to present the
view* of the New York Chamber of Com
merce, which he represented. He stated
that if the country was allowed much
longer to bold the present financial course
disaster and wreck- will certainly result.
He said that what the country needs is
stability of all kinds, stable tariff, stable
government and stable currency. He
said that prosperity conld now only be
restored by the establishment of a sound
monetary system. Mr. Rhoads was ap
plauded when he said he could s*e no
reason why the Government sdould not
base all its issues upon the gold standard
and replace all notes with coin certificates
protected by a 25 pÂ«r cent gold reserve.
In closing Mr. Rhoads denied with much
feeling the charge that there is hosti.iiy
in New Ycrk and other cities of the East
toward the West. H<s declared that the
interests of one part of the country are
the interests of a!L
Sir. Daushman of Chicago presented
the first proposition fSr the consideration ]
of the convention. 1 1 provided for the j
appointment of a committee of nine mem- !
bers, to be appointed by the President of
the United States within thirty days, in
cluding one member from the Senate Com
mittee on Finance and from the House
Committee on Banking and Currency.
The committee shall investigate the finan
cial subject, sitting in Washington, and
make report to Congress of their conclu
sions by bill or otherwise. The members,
other than the Senator and Representa
tive named, shall be paid for their serv
ices by the Government. Three sball be
bank-rs, three merchants or mauufactur- j
era â¢ and one â¢ a political economist repre
senting the several geographical sections
of the country.
Some Indiana delegates, through E. F.
Ci3ypool, presented a scheme prefaced by
a review of banking experiences in the
United States, the reading of which occu
pied ail the time alloted to its presenta
tion and ii went to the committee on reso
lutions without being disclosed to the con
vention.
Mr. Chadwick of Brooklyn offered a
resolution directing the committee on
resolutions to take into consideration the
expediency ol incorporating info the Na
tional bank system of the principle of
Scottish branch banks.
Mr. Peat offered the resolutions adopted
by the St. Paul Chamber of Commerce
advocating the maintenance of the gold
standard, withdrawal of the Government
from the banking business and theexten- j
sion of the national bank system by the
establishment of branches and the reduc
tion oi the minimum capital stock re
quired of such institutions to. $25,000.
George G. Tanner of Indianapolis or
fered a resolution declaring in favor of a ;
refunding of the National debt, the retire- j
ment of greenbacks, a more expansive sys
tem of National bank currency and tbe â 
imposition of severe penalties upon Na- â¢
tional bank directors for failure of duty, â 
to be presented to Congress by a commit- j
tee of the convention.
H. H. Hanna of Indianapolis presented
a scheme for tne appointment of a mone- j
tary commission of eleven members, to be !
named by this convention and to work at ;
.the expense of the convention invesugat- j
ing the financial subject, its conclusions to j
be reported to an adjourned meeting cf j
the convention with a view to their pre
sentation to Congress if legislation should !
be deemed desirable.
John P. Irish, as an expression of the !
views of the Banters' Association of Cali
fornia, adopted May last and reaffirmed
in December, cue red a declaration that
tbe present gold standard should be main
tained, and that any attempt to lower
that standard would be disastrous 10 every ;
class of people, and that only so much
silver and paper shall be Issued as the
country can consume, relieving the Gov- \
ernment of the responsibility of maintain- I
ins it at a parity with gold.
Eugene Levering of Baltimore, repre
senting a community noted for its con- |
servative banking methods, as evidenced, j
be said, by tbe fact that Baltimore bad j
had no bank failures for the past sixty j
years, presented a series of resolutions j
from that delegation declaring that legis- |
lation was necessary for the maintenance I
of the gold standard, cancellation of j
! United States legal tender note*, the j
I simultaneous creation of a safe and ex- '
i pansive currency upon the basis of the
j Baltimore plan.
S. T. Cadden offered a resolution favor

banks.
T. B. Ted sum of Savannah, Ga., rre
senteJ what he described a- a modification
of the Baltimore plan, on the line of ad

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1897.
ALLEN AND VILAS
AMUSE THE SENATE
Difference of Opinion as to
What Constitutes True
Democracy.
Keen Thrusts and Parries in
Discussing the Real Party
Platform.
Witty Interchanges During an Ani
mated Debate en the Home*
stead Bill.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 12.â After
the transaction of some routine morning
business the Senate at 12:15, on mction of
Sherman (ft.) of Ohio, proceeded to the
consideration of executive business. The
doors were reopened at 12:30 and legisla
tive business was resumed.
Hill (D.) of New York introduced a bill
filing the appointments of fourtb-ciass
postmasters at four years, except in cases of
tbe filling of vacancies by death, removal
or resignation, in which cases tbe appoint
ments are to be for the unexpired portion
of the term-
After some discussion the bill was re
ferred to th* Postoffice Committee.
Platt (R.) of Connecticut offered a reso
lution, which was aereed to, instructing
the Committee on Rales to consider the
practicability of abbreviating the daily re
ports of ttoe proceedings of Congress, as
published in the Record.
The resolution offered yesterday by Al
len (Pop.) of Nebraska, calling on the Sec
retary of the Navy for information as to
the enforcement of the eight-hour law by
contractors under the Navy Department
at Brooklyn and New York, was taken up
and agreed to.
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire, who
had asserted yesterday that the law did
not apply to the contractors, confessed
that he had been wrong in that assertion.
The resolutions on which Proctor (R.)
of New Hampshire spoke yesterday, fixing
the Presidential term at six years and pro
hibiting re-election, were taken up to sire
an opportunity to Stewart (Pop.) of
Nevada to express bis views upon them.
He favored the prohibition of re-eiection,
but he considered the extension of the
term to six years as objectionable. He
woul-i much prefer to have the term lim
ited to two year?. The strain of a four
year election was about all that the coun
try could stand. If the President were
elected for two years he would come into
power in harmony with the Congress
elected at the same time.
Tne resolutions were referred to the
Committee on Privileges and Elections.
The unfinished business being the House
bill for free homesteads on public lands
acquired from the various Indian tribes
was taken up. The bill ar&s advocated by
Nelson (R.) of Minnesota as a jasi exten
sion of the free homestead policy.
After Nelson took his seat Chandler (K.)
of Nexr Hampshire tresc-nSed a memorial
from Henry A. Dupori. claiming to have
been elected to a teat in the United States
Senate on May 9, 1895, and urging the re
opening of the question. The memorial
was referred to the Committee on Prtvi
leses and Elections.
The debate on the homestead bill was
resumed and Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska
made an argument in favor of the bill.
In commentmg on the declaration made
by Platt (R.) of Connecticut, when the
bill was iast under discussion, that be
would not be bound by t..e free- homestead
plank in the National Republican Conven
tion, Alien spoke in bitter terms of "good
men" meeting in convention and putting
forward principles for the purpose of get
ting votes and being bound by the declar
ation?.
Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts challenged
the use of phrase "good men" aa applied
to such people.
"Perha; b," said Allen, "I should have
quarried my statement by saying "good
men in other respects.''
"And scoundrels in that respect," Hoar
suggested.
'Not necessarily so," Allen replied,
"politicians in tnat respect."
"I should say scoundrels," Hoar per
sisted.
"Possibly the Senator would," said
Alien. "He ia plainer in his language
than I am."
In closing his speech Allen spoke of the
! existing "reign of bankruptcy" being the
| logical consequences of the finaucia:
: policy of the Government, and he sug
; seated the adoption of a policy that would
! be fair and just to all.
Villas (D.) cf Wisconsin said that al
| though the pending bill dia not attract
'â  much attention it v. a* a bill tbat proposed,
i according to the report of the Secretary
i of the Interior, to surrender $35,000,000 in
I money which was. in part at ieast, due on
j contracts already made between the Gov
< ernment and settlers on the public lands.
j It was about to bestow on individuals
] in Â«maii sums, varying from $160 to $450,
!an aggregate very large in amount. It
| would therefore seem to require strong
! reasons (granting the power of Congress)
to justiiy its passage.
We proceeded to rehearse In detail the
history of the homestead lav and to state
reasoiis why the pending bill should not
| be passed.
Allen interrupted Vilaswith a question
: as to the homesiead plank in the Chicago
j platform.
"If teat platform," Vilas replied, "is
the one I understand it to be, I will say
tnere is almost nothing in it tbat is not
inimical to the interest of the United
Slates."
"I suppose," said Pettigrew, "that the
j Republican platform, wuicb is meant, is
I tne one the Senator from Wisconsin
i supported."
"By no means," said Vilas. "I sup
j ported the platform adopted at Indianap
olis, and if there is one sentence, line or
word in that platform not found in Dem
ocracy I would Jifce to have it pointed
out."
Allen was about to read from the
Chicago platform when Vilas interrupted
him and said the Democratic platform was
the one adopted at Indianapolis.
"lam reading, " sa:d Allen, "from the
regular Democratic platform and not from
the Indianapolis rump platform." He
added, "Is the Senator pleased with Wis
consin going Republican last year?"
"I most cordially approve," saiu Vila*,
"the determination of the people of Wit-
I conÂ»in, who by a majority of 110,000 in a
I voting population of a little over 400,000,
cast their votes against a policy detrimen
tal to the interests of the United States."
"Then the Senator," Allen insisted,
"approves the election of McKinlev and
the success of the Republican party?"
'I am not interested iv political quips,"
Vilas replied. "'There was no step taken
last campaign that brings reproach to
me."
'â¢That is the same pies that Wat Tyler
made," Alien put in.
"The action of certain other persons,"
Vilas retorted, "might have warranted
tbe same. I performed my political duties
as I saw them, and 1 nave no explanation
to make. The Indianapolis platform was
founded throughout on Democracy."
Vilas then proceeded with his argument
against t c bill, tbe passage of which, he
said, won.'d lay tbe foundation for a de
mand for the repayment of all the money
heretofore paid to tbe Government by set
tlers on Indian land-.
Pcffer (Pop.) of Kansas followed in ad
vocacs- ot the bilL In a digression to show
tbe wealth of the State of KaaÂ»as, he de
clared that die peop.e of that State were
as honest and as enterprising as they ever
were, and that, although they were now
under a cloud, they would come out rieht
at tbe end.
The bill went over without action and
tne Senate at 5:30 went into executive
session, shortly after adjourning until
to-morrow.
CHICAGO CELESTIALS ALARMED.
Anxious to Be Rid of a Highbinder Juat
Released From the State
Pen it en tiarj.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 12.â For two nights
not a Chinaman in mil Chinatown has
dared to close his eyes in sleep for fear of
being robbed or murdered. The cause of
ail this fear and trembling is the presence
in tne city of Yung Nooy, who was
r*cer.tiy released from the Joliet peniten
tiary.
Nooy was convicted of highway robbery
and went to tbe penitentiary lor a term of
two years- His victim was a brother
Chinaman, and so incensed were his
countrymen that they made up a purse
and secured an attorney to assist in the
prosecntion of Yung. After his conviction,
Yung swore to have revenge on all China
men who in any way assisted in his con
viction.
Last Saturday Yung was released from
the penitentiary and at once returned to
Chicago. When be made his appearance
in Chinatown Saturday evening the great
est consternation prevailed. During Sat
urday and Sucdav nights there was no
sleep in Chinatown. Early yesterday
morning a committee waited on Yung and
asked him if he wouid teturn to San
Francisco, provided he was furnished with
moncv to pay nis way. Yung said be
would do so, and the committee called on
Chinese merchants and iaundrymen and
soon secured tbe sum of $50.
Tbe sum was riven to Yung yesterday
afternoon with tne understanding that
he was to leave Chicago at 9:30 o'clock
last night. During the eveniug Wong
Chong Foo. editor of the Chinese News,
became suspicious that Yung wouid Dot
keep his promise, and at 8:30 o'clock hur
ried to the Harrison- street stauon in
search of a poiiceman. Wong explained
to the officer that Yung was then in a
Clark-street resort, and he wanted the offi
cer to frighten Yung out of the city.
An officer accompanied Wong, bat it
was found that Yung had made bis es
j cape. Then began a search for him. Every
Chinaman on Clark street, between Van
Buren and Harmon, turned detective,
and every basement and garret Tvere
searched.
An hour later he was again found in a
basement at 313 Clark street, and this time
the officer secured him. Then it was that
I Yunc explained that he had spent the en
tire $50 given him and was unable to get
out of town. Wong Ci.onz 100 swore out
a warrant for Yung, charging him with
obtaining money by fa.se pretenses and
be was locked up in the Harrison-street
station.
So anxious are the Chinamen to be rid
of Yung that when his ca-e is called in
the Harrison-street Police Court this
morning they will allow turn to choose
between another term in prison and ban
ishment to San Francisco. Should ne
choose the latter another purse will be
made. A railroad ticket will be purchased
for him and he will be taken :rom tbe
Harrison-street station by an officer and
placed on the train which will bear him
away Jrom Chicago.

DENVER, Colo., Jan. 12.â The simplest
and most unpretentious inauguration in
the history of Colorado was that of Gov
ernor Adams at noon to-day. j The onl v :
expense was $3 for printing tickets of ad
; mission to the capital. The inaugural ad- \
dress _of the Governor demands rigid
economy in State affairs.:
Alva Adams was , born in Wisconsin in
1850. He modestly describes his education
as a "log-schoolhouse education.'' He
came to Colorado in 1871, and in January,
1-7.'. started a hardware business in Colo
rado Spring*, and soon after transferred it
it to Pueblo. From this center he has or
ganized branch houses in various parts of
the State, putting them under the charge
of young : men whom be has selected ana
trained for the purpose. -He has the repu
tation of having : done in , this way more
than any other man in the State to pro
mote its welfare. Governor * Adams has
not ' become rich, but he has made many*
others rich. , <
His inteilectual growth has Kept pace
with bis prosperity. He has one of the
best private librar.es in the State. It is a
working library, especially rich in book?
on practical questions, such as economics
and sociology.
He has always been a Democrat, but
was eiecteU Governor in 1887 by a union
of tbe best elements in tae State regard
iess of party .ines. Tne simple, straight
forward business administration which be
pave In 1887-89 iÂ« a guarantee that his ad
ministration in 1597-99 will be one of in
telligent and conservative progress.
MAUI)L> OK MASOti?
Intcrettlng Fight in Frogrtua for the
Jliinoin Senatort hip.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Jan. 12.â The
Senatorial tignt is still the ail-absorbing
topic among the members of the general
Assembly and politicians in general. The
forces of botn Madden and Mason have
been exerting every possible influence to
day to secure enough support to insure
tne nomination of the man of their
choice. Many conferences have been held
during tbe day, prominent among which
was a lengthy conference of the Cook
County supporters of Madden, in which
they thought they might possibly get the
few anti-Madden Cook County members
into line.
The Mason forces, nearly fifty in num
ber, held a conference in ilia quarters this
aftt-rnoon and compared votes. Tlsey left
Mr. Mason feeiing very confluent, and
they are bold to assert to-night that they
pre certain of success. It is rumorel that
Representative Schubert has forsaken
Madden and identified himself with tbe
Mason crowd. A conference of party
leaders is now being held which may re
salt in interesting developments later.

NICARAGUA CANAL
BILL COMING UP
House Committee on Rules
Gives an Audience to
Promoters.
Pacific Coast Representatives
Explain the Commercial
Advantages.
Should the Measure Be Reported It
Wi!l Undoubtedly Pass bj a
Large Majority-
WASHINGTON. D. C Jan. 12.â The
Hou-a Committee on Rales to-day gave
an audience to a number of Represecta
tiyes and Senators who are interested in
the Nicaragua canal bill. Among those
present were Representatives Herman
and Ellis of Oregon, Doolittie of Washing
ton, Loud, Bowers, Baroam and HU
bom of California, Joy of Missouri, Ma
hon of Pennsylvania and Senators Mo-
Bride and Perkins of Oregor. and Califor
nia, respectively.
Doolittie, who is a member of the House
Commerce Committee, which framed ihe
measure, read it at length and explained
its various sections. He was interrupted
from time to time by various members of
the Rues Committee, wbo questioned
him closely upon the practicability of the
scheme, the engineering difficulties to be
encountered, the cost of the waterway
and the effects of the Government's guar- |
an tee of the bonds. -
Borne douDt being expressed as to the
feasibility of the canal, Doolittie there
upon explained to the committee how
thoroughly toe engineer officers of the
Maritime Canal Company had surveyed
the route and how fully their work was
supplemented by that of the special en
gineer commission which went to Nica
ragua for the same pnrpose in July, 1?95.
He showed that the United States Engi
neer Commission was satisfied that the
canal could be built, but that the only
difference between them and the Mari
time Company was as to the sum neces
sary to complete it.
Speaker Reed explained at one point in
the proceedings that he had always been
satisfied with the practicability of the en
terprise; that he was partial to any legis
lation that would benefit the Pacific Slope,
in which he was always interested, and
that he did not doubt its great benefit to
the people residing on boih the Atlantic
and Pacific slopes. But he desired infor
mation concerning the atmospheric and
physical conditions to be encountered,
and be inquired particularly as to the pos
sibility of cloudbursts and earthquakes.
To these queries Mr. Doolittie replied,
quoting from the report made by the reg
ister office as veil as the reports Oi the
Maritime Company.
If the Rules Committee should permit
the bill to come Up for discussion it will,
it is claimed, pass by a large majority, aa
it is understood to have the support of all
the Republicans except a score or so and
a coin sixty of the Democrats iv addition.

SLAYER FREED
Mrs. Alice M. Hartley of
Reno Restored to
Liberty.
Granted a Pardon After Nearly
Two Years of Life in a
Penitentiary.
Two Supreme Court Justices Declare
That the X T.ing Was
Justifiable.
CARSON, Nev., Jan. 12.â Mrs. Alice M.
Hartley, who snot and Killed Stale Sena
tor M. D. Foley at Reno two years ago, is
a free woman. The application for a par
don was granted by the State Board of
Pardons. The grounds on which the
board based :ts action weie that the
shooting was justifiable, as Foley had
wronged her; that she bad been suffi
ciently punished, and that she had a
child to raise. Those voting in favor of
the pardon were Governor Sadler and Su
preme Court Justices Bonn held and Mas
; sey, and upposed were Justice Belknap |
and Attorney-General J. R. Judge.
r Senator Foley was killed on the upper
lioor oi his own bank building in Reno.
Mrs. Hartley had opened a studio there a
Jew months belore and was an artist of fair
ability. Being a woman of good* educa
tion and engaging manners, she was soon
received into the best society in Reno.
Foley became a frequent visitor at her !
rooms, and, it is said, became infatuated
with her.
One afternoon several shots were ljeard
in her room and Foley staggered down- i
stairs with two bullets in his body and
dropped on the sidewalk, where be died.
He was able to speak after he was shot,
but said nothing regarding the tragedy or
the causes that led to if.
Mrs. Hartley was tried and convicted of
murder in the second degree and sen
tenced to eleven years in the penitentiary, j
A few months after the killing she tave j
birth to a child, which she swore was j
Senator Foley's. She testified in court '
that her wine was drugged by Foley and
her ruin accomplished by this means.
Foiey was the leading business man of
Reno and very enterprising, but generally
disliked throughout the State because of
his aggressive disposition, his treacherous
nature and his contempt of the honor of
. women. His "affairs" were so numerous i
that his death by the pistol route had
been predicted for years.
Petitions came from all over the State in
behalf of the pardon of Mrs. Hartley, and
one signed by fifteen of JKoley's former
acquaintances recommended that the
State give his slayer a medal. There were
also petitions against her pardon, but not
numerously signed.
A couple of months ago a suit was j
brought on behalf of the child against (be i
Foley estate in the United States District
Cuiirt. The plaintiff lacked but one vote
of a verdict and the same case will now
| come up Dgain. i

PORTLAND'S AGED VISITANT.
Carrying H.s Ninety-Seven Years Lightly,
Samuel Grandelmeyer Crosses
the Continent.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 12.â A most re
markabie man in some respects is Samuel
B. Urandelmeyer of Brooklyn, N. V., who
has come to Portland to take home his
great-grandson, Samuel Q. Giles, a conv
lescent typhoid fever patient domiciled on
North Ninth stieet.
Mr. Grandelmeyer is 97 years old,
with the appearance of a well-preserved
wÂ»n of 60. He is six feet tall and weighs
240 pounds. His figure is erect, his face
is without wrinkles, with a flowing, snow
white mustache, and his head is sur
mounted by a wealth of white hair. Mr.
Grandelraeyer says that he has a third set
of natural teeth, which began growing in
his seventy-second year, and tney are as
reaular anU white as any that can be pro
cured by the highest-priced dentist. He
was never confined to his bed by sickness
except when he had the measles.
â¢'My life was anything but a regular
one," said h* to a Call correspondent.
"Born in Louisiana I did not settle down
io a regular career until 1 was 30 years
old. I well remember â yes. as if it were
but last weekâ when 'Old Hickory' con
fiscated the cotton bales to prevent the
British cannon balls from destroying the
Crescent City. I was there with my
father. "We came up from Baton Rouge,"
and the old gentleman's eyes glistened
like those of a youth, as he recounted tne
incidents of that memorable battle of New
Orleans.
Mr. Grandelmeyer proceeded to relate
thit he participated in the Seminole In
dian war in Florida and in the Mexican

Her Cell and Commits Suicide
by Hanging.
TJKIAH, Cal., Jan. 12.â Elsie Johnson,
an inmate of the State Asylum for the In

jacket for patients, and. tying one end of
this to a joist in the lavatory and the other
end around her neck, she stepped from a
chair on which she was standing. When

TRAMPS PLACE
LIVES IN DANGER
Repeated Attempts Made ; to
. Wreck Trains Near
Ripon.
Catastrophe Averted Only by
the Prompt Action of an
Engineer.
South-Bound Express Stopped Within
a Few Feet of an = Op;n
Switch.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 12.â The vicinity
of Ripon, in this county, has been terror
ized by tramps v during the past week, and
several attempts have been made to ditch
and rob trains. Last night two switches
were broken and thrown open. to derail a
Southern * Pacific '^passenger 1 1 train, but
those who made the attempt were evi
dently novices at the business, and the
train ran on to the siding instead of
polrig off the track. The break was fixed
by men from the car shops, who were sent
from Latbrop, and the track was in good
order when the freight went by during the
night.
Not anticipating a repetition of last
night's affair, the switch at Ripon was
not guarded, and at 8:18 o'clock this morn
ing when the south-bound passenger went
by the^switches were found to be broken
in tne same manner as they were last
night. Only the prompt action of the en
gineer in reversing the engine averted a
catastrophe. He succeeded iv stopping
the train before it ran into the open
switch and then tne engine and cars were
run on to a siding while the broken track
and switch were repaired.
The crime was not reported to the Sher
iff's office here, but Sheriff Cunningham
will have the breaking of the tracks and
switches investigated. Constable John
son, who lives not far from Ripon, is at
work on the case, and hopes to have the
would-be wreckers in custody before long.
The residents about Ripon attribute the
attempt to the band of tramps which has
infested that community of late. It is
believed that the tramps intended to
ditch the train and then get such plunder
as they could from the passengers. Last
Saturday nieht they attempted to throw
the switch open and wreck a train, but the
break was discovered and repaired in time
to prevent the catastrophe they had
planned.
STOCKTON'S REFORM WAVE.
Commercial Association Strives for Econ
omy and a Lessening of
Taxes.
STOCKTON, Cai*, Jan. 12.â The rooms
of the Stockton Commercial Association
were crowded to-nipht by the members
and other citizens, who assembled to dis
cuss municipal reforms. A large delega
tion of property-owners was present, and
there was some very caustic talk with ref
erence to the great amount of money ex
pended during the past year on street im
provements. John Milan in a hot speech
declared that the taxpayers and owners
of realty were being swindled by the work
on the streets that they were compelled to
pay for. He eaid that not a single piece
of work had been done proper! v.
Street Suoerintendent Bidweil de
manded to know of a single street that
had not been properly macadamized. An
acrimonious debate foliov/ed and finally
grew so heated that Chairman Buell had
to cali a halt in tho proceedings. George
W. Patterson of the woolen- mills sug
gested that the meeting bad not been
called to inquire into the condition ot city
officials, but to devise ways by which all
public work in the future might be done
in a better manner. It was finally decided
to appoint a committee to investigate all
public work now being done, and to suz
gest such improvements as may be for the
best interest of the city.
ADVENTURE AT DESOLATION.
Prospector Treed by Two Bean la Saved
by Virtue of His Lusty Yelling
for Help.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 12. â Elmer
Thornburg, a minor living at Granite, Or.,
is just batk from Desolation in the North
Fork country. While there looking after
some of his prospects he had a thrilling
experience last week. He was seated on
a bowlder on Friday noon when he heard
grunts, behind Him, and lookinc around
saw two full-grown black bears approach
ing.
Tbornburg ran. The hungry bears
quickly took the scent and were after him.
When he saw that the race would be an
uneven one he climbed up among the
branches of a biack pine tree. Fierce with
hunger, their savage appetites just whet
ted sufficiently to make a fat man taste
good, the bears put their huge paws
around the slender tree trunk and en
deavored to reach him. Breaking off a
branch off the tree Thqrnburg rapped
smartly each black nose within reach, and
bruin would go away growling only to
return when the pain bad ceased.
Thornburg began to yell at the top of
his voice, in the hopes that his cries
might reach camp. They finally did,
and John Dickinson and Ed Flaherty
came out with their rifles and made it
possible for the unarmed and unharmed
man to descend from his perch. The
bears were killed.

the Simple Rites of the Reform
Burial Association.

burial in Santa Cruz under the rules of
the Relorni Burial Association will occur
tc-morrow morning. Dr. Phila A. Lyon,
who died at her home on East Cliff yester
day, was a member of the association, the
rules of which provide for a very simple
method of preparine the body for burial
and for the burial itself. Embalming is
resorted to only under extraordinary cir
cumstances, and the garments worn by
the dead are of the simplest kind. The
coffin must be plain and without orna
ment, and the cost of burial shall not ex
ceed %lb. The family may omit mourn
ing apparel. Religious services are op
tional with the family, or the previously
expressed wish of the deceased. A pecu
liarity of the rules governing burial is the
section requiring mat no hearse shall be
used, an ordinary vehicle or other con
venient means being employed.
Mrs. Lyon's funeral will be conducted
by Count Axeli Wachtmeister of San
Francisco. Mrs. Lyon was a member of
San Lorenzo Branch Theosophical So

FIGHT TO A DRAW.
Turner and Uwis Put Up a Game Contest
Before the California Club at
Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 12. â The
Turner-Lewis ten-round contest under the
auspices of the California Club to-night
ended in a draw. It was fight from start
to finish.
Lewis cut out the work from start to
finish. At the end of the round ho had
the colored man on the ropes. In thu
third he repeatedly landed terrific blows,
and Turner was st one time slisrhtly
grogsy. Lewis failed to follow his art
vantage, and after hot infighting time was
called.
In the sixth Turner had decidedly the
best of it, but in the eighth Lewis ham
mered him all over the ring. The colored
boy proved that he was a glutton for pun
ishment. The ninth round was especially
vicious. In the infighting Lewis had the
advantage ana once or twice seemingly
bad the black man at his mercy, but
failed to lollow up his leads and theStock
ton lad recovered like magic.
Lewis tried to put his man out in the
last round and both men fougbt like
demons. Lewis had the better of it, but
his plucky opponent was more than game
and was lighting when the gong sounded.
Referee Thomas Norton declared the
nght a draw.
SEATTLE It A>K â¢ JP" A IZ VBE.
Hithdra reals of llepoiil* Wreck a Sav

SEATTLE, Wabh., Jan. 12.â The Seattle
Savings Bans suspended' to-day, posting
tne following notice:
This bank is closed by order of the directors.
Depositors will be paid in lull.
The liabilities are $75,000, assets $100,000.
F. L. FebrÂ«?n, cashier, said there had been
gradual withdrawals of deposits since the
recent St. Paul and Chicago bunk failures.
The bank was entablished in 1891.
The Seattle Savings Bank has been
a large dealer in warrants, handling tor
months three-fourths of those issued by
King County. As t:>e -ueposiis decreased
the ban lc was compelled to dispose ol its
large line of warrants in order to keep its
cash up to the required reserve. This con â 
tinued until Monday, when some heavy
depositors draw out their money. The
officers of the bank, realizing its pre
carious condition, called in the fall board
of directors last evening and, after a ses
sion lasting until midnight, ordered the
bank closed this morning.
It is understood that the direct cause of
the bank closing was the attempted with
drawal of county funds yesterday by the
retiring County Treasurer, as his succes
sor requested the amount due to be paid
in cash. OnÂ« check for $5000 was pre
sented about 3 o'clock, bnt it was not hon
ored. Bondsmen of the new County
Treasurer object to having county funds
placed in savings banks.

Fruit- Growers J'rotpered During the
iear Juit Cloned.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 12.â The past
year was a very prosperous one for the
fruit-growers and vineyardists county.
This is evidenced by the large overland
shipments of all kinds of fruits and wine
during the year, the total shipments be
ing 88,385.115 ooiinds. This is a decrease
of over 23,000,000 pound* as compared
with 1895, but is accounted for by a
.chnnge in the manner ot making up the
"accounts at ihe railroad offices. *" Almost
the entire dried fruit crop has been so:d,
and there will be no old stock on hand
when the new season opens. Although
the crop was not as heavy as last year,
better prices have been obtained for fruit
and wines.

HEALDSBURG SUES
FOR STOLEN GOLD
Sensational Raid on the
City Hall in 1893
Recalled.
Action Brought Against the Late
Treasurer Mulligan's
Bondsmen.
Asked to Pay tbe Amount Sto'en
From the Vaults by Two
Outlaws
SANTA ROSA. Cal., Jan. 12.â The cele
brated Healdsburg robbery case came np
before the Superior Court here to day.
The action is brought by the city of
Healdsburg to recover about $4000 from
the bondsmen of George V. Mulligan, ex-
City Treasurer. The defendants claim
that Mulligan was the victim of a brutal
robbery on the morning of October 30,
1893, and according to a recent ruling of
the Supreme Court in this same case this,
if proven, will constitute a good defense.
The sensational robbery of the Healds
burg treasury will be long remembered in
this vicinity. Whan the place was found
open and the Treasurer missing upon that
eventful October morning the people of
Healdsburg were wild with excitement.
The tire bell was rung and hundreds
joined in tbe search for the missing man.
He was found late in the afternoon hand
cuffed to a tree in the cemetery and
wholly exhausted from the shock and ex
posure. Being far from robust and of a
highly sensitive nature, the unfortunate
man did not rally and was soon buried in
the cemetery where he had been so
roughly used.
Before his death Treasurer Mulligan re
lated now two men came to his home that
morning and told him his brother-in-law
was very sick. When be had hastily
dressed aii.i was leaving the house the
two men seized, bound and gagged him
and on pain of instant death forced him
to open the vault Then came the arrest
of a well-known young man of Healds
burg, who proved an alibi and at once-leit
for Scotland. Now the bondsmen of the
dÂ«--ad Treasurer are asked to pay the
amount missing, and a prolonged strug
gle is looked for.
LOS ANGELES SENSATION.
Colonel Treat Accused by a Woman Client
of Having Attempted to
Swindle Her.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 12.â Colonel
R. B. Treat, one of the best-known poli
ticians and lawyers in Southern Califor
nia, is at present under a cloud. He is
charged by Mrs. Lizzie Elliott, a client,
with attempts to swindle her in various
transactions.
M,rs. Elliott, who owns considerable
property in the city and has quite a sura
of money loaned out, called upon Deputy
District Attorney James a few days ago
and asked for a complaint against Colonel
Treat, charging him with embezzlement,
ohe stated to James that in July last she
had employed Colonel Treat to collect in
terest on certain loans, agreeing to pay
him $25 a quarter.
The District Attorney advised the irate
lady to delay her action nniil Colonel
Treat could be seen by the people's law
yer. This was agreeable, and when the
politician's attention was called to the
matter he acknowledged an indebif duess
ol $50 to Alb. Elliott and paid her $40 on
account. The lady was then advised to
bring a civil action for the balance.
The papers were no soofter filed than
Mrs. Elliott again called upon District
Attorney James and stated that she had
discovered a new cause of grievance
against Colonel Treat. She stated that
some time ago sbe handed him $500 to pay
on a rea.-estaie transaction. The cheek
was drawn in favor of Treat. A few days
ago, she declared, she called upon tne
person to whom the $500 was to have been
paid and was greatly surprised to learn
that Colonel Treat bad pnirt only $450 oi
the amount, holding back $50.
Colonel Treat states that there is an un
settled account between Mrs. Elliott and
himself, and that he has no fear of an
embezzlement charge. His only offense,
it any is needed, is that he paid himself
an overdue bill lor legal services.
Chief frlata Jte-elected.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 12.â Chief of
Police John M. Glass was re-el-cted to
day by the City Council. This is the third
term to which he has been elected, and
to-day's action means that the efficiency
of the present force will not be impaired.

Accident to Its Machinery Responsible for
the Steams flip Tacoma's
Slow Trip.
VICTORIA, B. G. Jan. 12.â The North
ern Pacific steamer Taco ma, overdue eight
days and for which grave apprehension
was felt, arrived this morning from Cbina

serious accident to the machinery. On
January 2, during severe gales, a heavy
bead sea caused the engine to race, and
the principal levers of the after valve were
carried away. The break could not be re
paired at sea, so tue forward engines were
disconnected and the necessary working
parts transferred to the after one. The
work was accomplished under great diffi
culties and danger, as the ship rolled heav
ily during the entire time. Sixty-six
hours' working, night and day, was re
quired to overcome the trouble.

SHOT TO DEATH
BY AN UNKNOWN
Coroner's Jury Decides That
David McAdams Was
Murdered.
Deep Mystery Veils the Killing
oi the Lamanda Park
Grocer.
Credence Given His Dying Declaration
That Hj Fought With
a Robber.
PASADENA, Cal., Jan. 12.â David W.
McAdams. the yoang Lamanda Park
grocer who was mysteriously shot at his
store yesterday morning, died at 5 o'clock
this morning. The statement he made in
regard to the tragedy, and which he ad
hered to until the last, was that between 2
and 3 Monday morning he was awakened
by some one in his store where he slept.
He partially dressed, took his revolver,
and by the light of a lamp burning in the
store saw a masked man with drawn re
volver fifteen feet away, at the casb
drawer. McAdams fired at the intruder,
who sprang toward him and shot him at
close range, then escaping by the front en
trance. McAdams dragged himself to
some sacks, where he lay groaning until
morning, when he attracted the aitention
of a tramp who was passing.
As many of the circumstances were pe
culiar, the place being securely locked
when McAdams was found, ho being par
tially dressed and a window having been
broken from the inside, it was believed by
some that suicide was attempted, but
nothing in the social or business life of
the young man shows cause. Nothing
was developed by the Coroner's inquest in
regard to his private life to lead to the
conclusion that he committed suicide. At
the inquest it was brought out that be had
had some business difficulty with his
former partner, W. J. Crandall, but there
was no pronounced ill felling so far as
known.
McAdams was a man of fine physique,
perfect health, good habits, cheerfui dis
position and was highly respected. He
said his assailant was a large man â

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Hail Senator Perkins.
Congratulations to the Senator-elect.
The Legislature will now proceed to bus
iness.
Grover should at once start the foreclos
ing mill.
Republicans know how to settle things
amicably.
The funding bill is dead, but there may
be some other scheme.
Bryan Is in New York arranging for the
publication of his book, and it seems the
lecture tour is off.
We have now a clear proof that when
Californians work together monopolies
cease to be dangerou-.
The Illinois Legislature shut off the ad
dress of retiring Governor Altgeld and
closed his term with a bang.
It is hardly necessary to hunt bargains
in the shops in these days. You can
catch them aimost anywhere.
The defeat of the funding bill shows
what a united California can do in master
ing the antagonisms which confront her.
Having got the funding bill out of the
way, the House of Representatives should
r.ow give attention to the Nicaragua canal
bill.
A close watch mu=t be kept on the de
faulting Pacific roads, for tne next phase
Â»-f the issae may be as bad as the funding
scheme.
New York is holding what she calls a
carnival, but as it is a cold show under a
t-hed, without roses or lilies, it is nothing
like what are known as carnivals in Cali
fornia.
There is now a prospect that the Union
and Central Pacific roads will become a
competing line to the Southern Pacific,
and the long monopoly of transportation
will be broken.
The reported split in Tammany may be
serious, but the people will not be'ieve it
until they seÂ«; a good many of the gang
dropping through the hole and falling out
of the machine.
The agreement of the great powers to
coerce Turkey was made known several
weeks ago, but up to date there is no evi
dence that the Sultan is aware that any
one is coercing him.
About all that Cleveland can do in re
gard to the Pacific roads debts is to ar
range the preliminaries for foreclosure
and get ready to turn everything over in
good shape to McKinley.
Last year we were talking of war with
England over Venezuela, and now we pro
pose a treaty of arbitration which will put
an end to all chance of war. Our relations
with the British are decidedly versatile.
While not a single line has been written
of the new tariff everybody knows it will
give to American industry a cbance to
find employment every day in the week at
good wages. There is no uncertainty
about that.
The public hearings before the Ways
and Means Committee have closed and
now the actual work of framing the tariff
bill begins. Fortunately it i 3 in good
hands and the people can rely on having
good results.
A kindergarten attachment to a church
for the care of babies while their parents
worship is a Los Angeles idea well worth
working out The people of the City of
Angels really do have angelic inspira
tions sometimes.
The prospects are that the monetary
conference at Indianapolis will simply
aiscuss general principles and leave the
details of legislation to Congress. In
other words, it will be a meeting of much
talk and no business.
The Senate has tackled the question
whether the power to recognize foreign
Governments lies in the President exclu
sively, and a big field is now open for
orators to show eloquence and learning as
expounders of the constitution.
The Spaniards cannot conquer the
Cubans, but they can destroy the homes
of thousands and inflict great suffering
upon the people. That is what they are
aiming to do, and that i 3 w at the United
States should stop in the interests of
humanity.
The fact that upward of 8000 taxpayers
have not called at the office of the City
Treasnrer to collect tue rebates allowed on
the taxes paid early last year ought not to
deprive them of the benefit of the rebate.
It should be credited to them on their
taxes this year.
Once more Speaker Reed has given evi
dence of bis masterly ability to bring im
portant issues to prompt settlement and
get them out of the way. Under any
other Speaker the funding bill might have
obstructed the business of Congress for
the whole session.
A Kansas legislator proposes a law by
whic i any man who owns more tian IGO
acres of land can dp forced to sell any por
tion of his holding in excess of that
amount to any person who offers for it a
price which a jury will consider reason
able. How is that for socialism made
sociable and neighborly?
SENATOK PERKINS.
The re-election of Senator Perkins by
the' California Legislature is another evi
dence that conservatism is at this time
the dominant spirit of the country. The
people are aware that grave problems con
front them, and that serious issues in
volving radical remedies are coming to
the front They are also aware that men
of talent, genius and youth are arising to
meet these problems and to master them.
The people, however, seem to prefer to
stand by old landmarks and to continue the
present condition of things until they see
more clearly ihe nature of the problems in
frontof them and have a better under
standing of the solutions proposed by men
of talent.
Senator Perkins is eminently a conserva
tive statesman. He is known to be a safe
man of affairs and sound in his devotion
to Republican principles. He has long
been prominent both in the business and
the politics of the State, and, if he has
never distinguished himself brilliantly,
has been at all times a man in whom the
people have had confidence and who could
be lelied upon to perform whatever duties
he undertook. He is, therefore, in every
sense well fitted to represent the people at
this juncture and to maintain for them in
Ccnpress that conservatism which they
feel in their own homes.
The Call opposed Senator Perkins be
cause it believed the time had come when
youth and genius suould be called to the
front to grapple with the responsibilities
of statesmen in dealing with the new
issues that everywhere affect American
life. The Call desired to see a younger,
more forcible and more resolute man sent
to the Senate to advocate the interests of
California and to defend its cause in every
issue that arose either in local or in Na
tional politics.
It has, however, no objection to urge
aeainst the election of Senator Perkins
since the vote of the Legislature makes
it evident that he is in a fair sense a
representative of California Republican
ism as it exists to-day. During his term
of office Senator Perkins will have the
full eupport of The Call, so long as he
maintains the great principles to which
he is pledged, and may count on all the
help The Call can give him to advance
every interest which California may have
at stake in National legislation.
It is with no little satisfaction we recall
the fact that during the whole of the con
test for the election of Senator The Call
uttered no word derogatory of the man
hood or official integrity of Senator Per
kins. It acted as the champion oi Samuel
M. Shortridge and supported his canvass
in that high- minded and honorable
way which the dignity of the office
required. It was not on the part of
Mr. Shortridge nor on tne part of The
Call a campaign of vilification or abuse.
Full justice was done to the merits of Mr.
Perkins as a man and as a Senator, and in
no instance did vulgarity or vile cartoon
ing disgrace our opposition to him or to
his efforts for re-election.
It is with sincerity The Call extends
to tbe Senator- elect congratulations
on his election. He is clearly the rep
resentative of the conservatism of the
day, and is justly entitled, therefore, to
claim in the Senate that be stands as a
true exponent of the sentiments of the
people of California at this juncture.
Having served for some time in the Son
ate his experience will be of value to the
State, and the Republican party confi
dently counts on him to justify its action
in electing him.
A UNITED CALIfOENIA.
Tbe defeat o! the funding bill is a strik
ing proof of the ability of tbe people of
California to overcome all difficulties ana
master all the antagonisms in tbe way of
progress when they are united and work
together with a resolution born of a com
mon will directed to a common object.
No individual nor set of individuals ran
claim credit for the defeat of the bill. It
was in the truest sense a victory of the
whole people. In that contest if in no
other the people, the press and the states
men of California worked together and a
brilliant triumph has been the result.
This is not the only recent evidence
which Californians have had of the value
of united and harmonious work. As a
matter of fact it is not the best evidence
we have cad. The truest accomplish
ment of a united California of recent date
is the construction of the Valley Railroad.
The defeat of the funding bill was merely
negative; the construction of the road was
positive work. In the one case we have
simply prevented the infliction of a wrong
upon the State, but in the other we have
achieved a genuine benent, whose results,
already good, are but the earne-t of a
greater good yet to be obtained for Cali
fornia and for ail the industries of its
people.
With these two illustrations of the ad
vantage ot united work, there is every in
ducement to the people of California to
lay aside all petty dissensions and minor
interests and devote themselves to those
greater issues wherein all can work to
gether, because' the benefits resulting will
be for the good of all. It is clear to every
intelligent man that a new era has dawned
in California, and that we are now to go
forward to new things and meet new
problems. It is also clear that the solu
tion of these problems will depend largely
upon co-operative enterprise. The issues
belore us are vast and cannot be mastered
by individuals. We must work together
not only to take advantage of the oppor
tunities of good, but also to guard against
the possibilities of impending? evil.
The question of the Pacific roads has
not been settled by the defeat of the.fund
ing bill. It is sure to arise in a new phase
uefore long, and it is possible that the new
form may be as injurious to California as
was the scheme of refunding. Public
sentiment, now united on the subject,
should be kept, therefore, to its full
height and as resolute as ever until the
issue has reached a final solution. It is
not possible at this time to predict the
future. All we can do is to wait aud see
what will happen next. We may be sure,
however, that no matter what happens,
so long as the people of California are as
united upon the subject as they are to-day
they wiil be able to guard against any
danger which may threaten.
THE ARBITBATION TEEATY.
The proposed arbitration treaty between
the United States and Great Britain
differs widely from otber treaties which
have borne the same high-sounding and
promising name. Former treaties have
been arranged for the settlement of some
specific issue well defined by the parties
interested, and the courts organized to
determine them have been temporary in
their nature and strictly limited in their
powers. The new treaty provides for a
different sort of court. It is to continue
so long as the traaty continues, and so far
from being limited to some specific issue
is to arbitrate every international dispute
except such as ars specifically excluded.
The proposed tribunal is to be known as
the high court of arbitration. It is to be
composed of three Justices of the Su
preme Court of the United Btates and
three members of the High Court of Ap
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1897.
peals of Great Britain. It is to have ex
clusive jurisdiction over all questions now
pending except those of Bering Sea and
Venezuela, which have been arranged for
otherwise, and over all which may arise
in future, except such as involve National
honor and sovereignty. By its terms the
treaty is to be in force for but five years
from the date of ratification, but there can
be little question but that it will be re
newed and that a step has been made to
ward a permanent court for the settle
ment of international disputes.
In submitting the treaty to the Senate
Mr. Cleveland very justly said:
Its success ought not to be doubtful, ana the
fact that its ultimate ensuing benefits are not
likely to be limited to the two countries im
mediately concerned should cause it to be pro
moted all the more eagerly. . The example set
and the lesson furnished by the successful
operation of this treaty are sure to be felt and
taken to neart sooner or later by other na
tions, and will thus mark the beginning of a
new epoch in civilization.
The American people will cordially re
spond to these sentiments. The establish
ment of this court is the direct result of
American initiative. It will stand as an
evidence of our influence among the na
tions, as a proof of our power for peace as
well as war, and its inception will be ac
counted one of the few good features of
the Cleveland administration.
TECHNICAL TEAINING.
The fact that within the past few years
wages have risen from 15 to 20 per cent in
the German empire makes the news from
England that a number of her citizen*,
interested in technical art instruction,
hayÂ« recently been in Germany studying
the industrial conditions there, a matter
of no surprise. English merchants have
fonnd it profitable to import goods from
Germany arid then export them to South
America and the various British colonies,
and the reason why Britain does not
manufacture as well as 'export the com
modities is of such importance as to call
for careful investigation.
The men who have undertaken this
work performed a similar service fifteen
years ago, when they were selected by the
British Government to report whether
there were any methods in German in
dustry which might be profitably adopted
by Great Britain. That the recent investi
gating committee were enlightened dur
ing their visit to the realm of the Kaiser
and came home well prepared to instruct
their countrymen in skilled production is
no more a matter of surprise than their
going, for the Germans are the most
scientific and scholar.}' of all peoples, and
when they bring their scientific scholar
ship to bear upon the useful arts the re
sults are sure to be progress worthy of
imitation.
Sir Philip Magnus, who was the chmr
man of the commission fifteen years aso,
and is the leader in the Jate inquiry, has
recently delivered an address showing
wherein chiefly lies German superiority.
The secret of theii success is in thorough
technical training. When these gentle
men were in Berlin fifteen years ago there
was a big building being erected there, to
be used as a technical school, tbe cost of
wnich was to be $1,850,000. On their sec
ond visit they found this school was
training 3000 students, and it had been
necessary to put up additional buildings.
In a single German factory they found 100
thoroughly educated chemists employed
to experiment to discover better methods
of production. This is an enterprise for
turning scholarship to practical account of
such magnitude as to startle English and
American manufacturers and awake them
to tbe necessity of careful training in those
who would stand up long in the ring of
industrial competition.
In his address Sir Philip stated that al
most all the profitable results from a valu
able discovery made by an English chemist
were being reaped by Germany, because
of the large number of practically trained
chemists available for use in the factories
in that land of widely extended technical
instruction.
80 great has been the advantage thus
gained by Germany in some branches of
manufacture over England Sir Philip
Magnus gravely suggests that his Govern
ment should repeal that part of her mer
chandise marks law which requires im
ported articles to be marked with the
name of the country whence they c*ime.
The German brand is giving the British
exporters away, and their colony cus
tomers are learning to sena direct to
Hamburg for their merchandise. The ad
vice is such a conf> ssion of inferiority as
seems like suggesting that German skill
can only be met by English fraud. An
other interesting revelation of the report
is that the manufacturers of Germany find
thai; shortening the hours of labor does
not increase the cost of production; brains
are far more important a factor in pros
perity than drudgery, and the fact that
the great manufacturers are getting a
practical proof of it augurs well for the
future cf the workinernan.
The moral of thi3 story is obvious.
Every effort should be made in this coun
try to establish thoroughly equipped
technical schools and give all our workers
a chance to be skilled. The community
will reap the benefit in better and cheaper
commodities, an l the workman will at
the same time have more houn for recrea
tion and improvement and cease to be a
drudge.

WAS THE VALET OF
CHARLES DICKENS
Remarkable Life History of
Jackson Jordan, a
Pioneer.
Celebrated His Eighty-Sixth
Birthday on Friday
Last.
He Was in General Vallejo's Employ
When the Latter Was Captured
at Sonoma*
On Friday last Jackson Jordan, one of
the few surviving argonauts of 1845 and
JACKSON JORDAN, a Pioneer of J845, Who Was Once the Valet
of Charles Dickens and General Vallejo's Overseer.
one of the most remarkable men in Cali
fornia to-day, celebrated his eighty-sixth
birthday and spent the anniversary of his
coming into the world visiting among the
gray- haired veterans who are gradually
passing away.
Jackson Jordan's life history, if it is
ever fully written, will make a volume
that will be interesting to every Califor
nian and to the country at large, for in the
last fifty years, which be has spent
largely in traveling, he has met and been
identified with a great many of tbe men
who have made California annals. He
was born in New Orleans in 1811, his
father being of Scotch-Irish parentage
and his mother a descendant. of a native
of Abyssinia.
Jordans early life was spent in the city
of bis birth until Charles Dickens, the
great English novelist, arrived in New
Orleans on his American tour. He was in
search of a confidential man, and young
Jordan's capabilities so impressed him
that he was engaged by the author.
Jordan was in ins service at ihe time
when Dickens' "American Notes" so in
censed the people that Dickens was com
pelled to flee to New York, and he accom
panied his employer. Later he went to
England with Dickens and remained there
some time.
In 1844 he returned to New York, and in
the following year took passage in the
American ship Jeanette, Captain Atkins,
for California, which was then practically
an unknown region. The vessel landed
first at Honolulu, and in the latter part of
1815 entered the Golden .Gate, landing at
Sausalito.
The early days of 1846 found Jordan at
Honoma as overseer of General Vallejo's
big e-tablishment there. He was present
when the general was captured by the
American forces that routed ttie Mexican
army. Returning to Ban Francisco he
opened the first hotel of tins City, the
Leidesdorff House.
Another turn of fortune's wheel made
Jordan a Sacramento boniface. In 1849 he
conducted the Sutter Hotel at the capital,
paying $3000 a month rental for the estab
lishment.
Flooded out in the latter part of 1849 he
removed to Virginia, Nevada, where be
went into the restaurant business and met
and became intimate with nearly all of
the men who in later years became the
money barons of the Pacific Coast-
Later be returned to California and dur
ing many years' residence in this City was
in the employ of many prominent men,
including Charles Crocker, William
Sharon, William Ralston, Senator Hearst
and others.
In 1879 be was proprietor of the Mint
saloon on Commercial street, which was a
celebrated resort at that time and fre
quented by the heaviest business men of
tne City.
For several years oast he has been con
nected with the Occidental and Oriental
Steamship Company and is at present
steward oi th ir big liner, Coptic, running
to China and Japan.
Jordan is a giant in stature, beinf,- over
six feet tall, and carrying himself with
the air of a man twenty-five years younger
than he really is.
He is a life-member of the Pioneers and
often calls on members of the organiza
tion to talk of the days wi en there were
but two store* where San Francisco now
stands and gold mining was not thought
of by the simple Mexican inhabitants.
On his eighty-sixth birthday .Agent
Stubos gave him a full holiday. While in
this City Jordan makes his home with
friends at 603}Â£ Stockton street, where he
has a pretty apartment overlooking the
bay and the >hips that he loves.
"I am getting old," said Jordan yester
day, while Jn a reminiscent mood, "and
most of the frieuds of my younger days
have gone, but I shall sail many a day be
fore I dock for the last time."
CONTEST TOE AUDITOB.
William Broderlck Continues to Hold
His Own "With "William A. Oeanc.
The contest of William A. Deane against
William Broderick for the office oi Aud
itor is still occupying Judge Troutt's atten
tion, and half a dozen clerks are kept
busy with their tally-sheets.
Up to the present time very little change
has been shown by the recount, and the
fact is disclosed that the returns of the re
[ cent election were made out in a first-class
mannerâ at least so far as the recount has
gone. If this may be said to prove any
thing it is that the people are becoming
accustomed to the workings of the Aus
tralian ballot, ana are ab e to vote intelli
gently and secure honest returns for their
votÂ«s under its provisions. i
Yesterday's work included the winding \
up of the recount of the Forty-fourth As- A
sembly District and a recount of a part of 1
the Thirty-sixth Assembly District.
In the Forty-fourth District the result
was as follows:
Precinct 7, Deane sains 2; Precinct 8, Denne
trains 2; Precinct 9, no change; Precinct 10,
Deane gains 1, uroderxk loses 2; Precinct 11,
Broderick gains 2. Deane gains 4; Precinct 12,
Broderick gains 1; Precinct 13, BroderkK
Rains 2; Precinct 14, no change; Precinct 15,
Deane loses 1.
In the Thirty-sixth District the follow
ing figures were given :
Precinct 1, Broderick gains 2; Precinct 2,
Broderick gains 1, Deane loses 1 ; Precinct 3,
uo change; Precinct 4. no change.
The net result to date is a gain of one
for Broderick.

The Eritish ship Glenesslin, now tied
up in Richardson Bay awaiting a wheat

raised and repaired she took a cargo of
kero-ene to Hongkong and from that
point went to England, where she was

said Captain Pritchard yesterday, "we
were chartered to load paraffine oil for
China. Unfortunately for all concerned,
three days before we were to sail the ship
took fire in the after end underneath the
cabin, and in order to save the vessel the
fire brigade sank her. My wife and I had
been away to Philadelphia to bid our
friends good-by, and when we returnee! to
the Glenesslin she was eight feet under
water. 1 and my wife and child saved
nothing in the world but what was on our
backs, so you can imagine our feelings.
They move quickly in New York, how

A cut of the raising of the Glenesslin
was made from a photograph taken by
Captain Pritchard at the time. The
G enesslin is not chartered, and the
chances are that she will remain there for
several months to come.
The American ship E. B. Sutton ar
rived from New York yesterday after an
uneventful passage of 155 days. She
brings an unusually heavy general cartro
and will be docked at once and probably
begin discharging this afternoon. On
Thanksgiving day, iv latitude 25 south,
longitude 86 west, Alfred Locke, second
officer, died of consumption and was
buried at sea. He was a general favorite
on the Sutton and his death cast a gloom
over the entire crew, so Thanksgiving
waÃ not a time for rejoicing on board the
E. B. Sutton.
The Merchants' Exchange received the
following telegrams yesterday from Lon
don:
The British steamer Glenesk, previously re
ported, has No. 4 ballast tank full of water,
and not as before reported.
The British 6teamer Queen Olga. previously
reported having put into Nagasaki, lias- gone

in twenty days. Cost is estimated at Â£'-JSOO.
The Alaska Packers' Association held
its annual meeting yesterday and re
elected the present managers and board

for thf position of postma-ter of Alameda.
Mr. Ltydecker is at present one of the
Town Trustees, but he teeks the higher
office, and, as both the Congressman and
Senator from the district are lor him, the
chances are all in his favor.
The tug Columbia arrived from Coos
Bay yesterday in order to undergo an
overhauling. She is a sister vessel to the
Hunter, now in port, and both of them
belong to the A. M. Simpson Lumber
Company. The Hunter has been over
hauled and is now in first-class order. She
will leave at once for Coos Bay and re.

while the Columbia is liable to remain'
here lor some months and handle the
vessels at this end.
The battle-ship Oregon has been or
dered to Acapulco and all is bustle and
hurry on board. The boys in blue are
more than pleased with the iuea of a
change as they are tired of lying off the
Union Iron Works with nothing to do.
Yesterday the warship had all her coal
and water aboard and by noon to-day she
will be fully provisioned. Tnen the lads
will be given an opportunity to say fare
well to their sweethearts and wives

The American ship Samaria, which ar
rived from Departure Bay lost night, re
ports the sea.ing schooner Allie I. Alger
clean. She was spoken sixty roilea west
of Point Arena, and the captain said he
had then five boats out, but that since
leaving San Francisco it was the tirst occa

None of the sealers that left last month
have so far paid expenses.
The American ship Kennebec, that came
in yesterday in tow of the wrecker White
law, brought in the largest load of lumber
that lias ever come from Puget Sound in
one vessel. In the hold and on the deck
there is 1.600,000 feÂ»t of rougft lumber, and
the captain thinks he might have brought
a few thousand feet more bad the weather
been favorable. As she passed up the bay
the K<*nnebec had a heavy list to star
bjard, but this was due to the fact that a
portion of the deck load had shifted.
The Harbor Commissioners have ac

SIXTEEN AND IN PRISON.
Martha Wohltmann Detained Under Sus
picion of Having Helped to Kob
Her Own House.
Martha Wohltmann, a girl 16 years of
age, is accused by her parents of having
connived with a young man-to rob their
house and of having helped him in the
commission of the crime.
The girl's father is Claus Wohltmann, a
teamster, living at 25 Isis street, which
runs between Twelfth and Thirteenth
streets from Folsom to Harrison. The
house was broken into on Sunday night,
December 27, daring the absence of the
famiiy, and $70 in coin, a gold watch,
diamond ring, gold ring and otaer jew
elry stolen.
The burglary was reported to the police,
and suspicion fell upon Martha, as she
had been away from home from the night
of the burglary.
Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Wobltmann
saw Martha talking to a young man on
Mission street. As soon as they saw Mrs.
Wohltmann going toward them they sep
arated and ran in different directions.
Mrs. Wohltmann pursued Martha for sev
eral blocks and would have been forced to
give up the chase if Policeman Lynch had
not taken part.
Lynch took the mother and daughter to
police headquarters and Mrs. Wohltmann
tearfully told of her daughter' 3 perfidy.
The girl refused to say anything and she
was detained pending further investiga
tion.
Later the girl said she was married by
contract to a younz man named Jack
Long and on the afternoon of the burg
lary she met Long on McAllister ana Lar
kin streets. He went home with ncr till
she could pet her clothes and then they
went to live in a lodgine-house on Mis
sioh street. She denied that either she or
Long took any of the money or jewelry,
but the police do not believe her.
After she hud told her story she was, at
the request of her mother, booked for
some public institution aud will probably
be sent to the Magdalen Asylum to-day.
POSTAL CLERKS TO MEET.
The Annual Gathering; Will : Be Held
in This City in March
, . Next. â¢
The annual convention of the Railway
Mail Service Mutual Benevolent Associa
tion wiil be held in San Francisco this
year, beginning March 16. There are 3754
members in the association and the repre
sentation at the gathering in this City will
be very large. In this, the eighth division,
there are 122 me :a bers. One reason for
the organization being so strong is be
cause the death benefits, $2000. are paid at
once upon official notification of death.
There is $30,000 in the treasury.
It is likely from present appearances
that the majority of the members wili as
semble at Chicago and come from there in
Pullman cars specially set aside for their
use. The convention will last nearly a
week, but before the postal officials return
to the East they will spend two or three
days in Los Angeles.
i'he local members are hard at work
raising funds to entertain their friends,
and among themselves they have secured
so far about $2000. In order to help out in
thi6 direction several entertainments are
in preparation. The first wiil be a lecture
and stereopticon entertainment to be held
in the Young Mens' Christian Association
building on February 4. The subject will
be "The Postal Service," by Postal In
spector J. W. Erwin. Other entertain
ments will take place before the conven
tion.

OBJECT TO TAX
COLLECTION LAWS
An Attempt to Upset the Act
That Was Passed
in 1895.
Plea That It Is Unconstitutional
Submitted in the Supreme
Court.
C aim Made of U: just Discrimination
Between Holders of Diffjrent
Classes of Property.
The act amending tbe Political Code
relative to the collection of taxes in this
county, which act was approved March
28, 1895, was under fire in tte Supreme
Court yesterday. The suit was that of C. J
B. Rode and William Bchultheis, doing j
business under tbe firm name of C. B.
Rode & Co., against Assessor John 1).
Siebe. Assistant Attorney-General Jack
son appeared to represent Attorney-Gen
eral Fitzgerald, trying thai the State
would be represented on briefs. Waller
H. Levy appeared as attorney for the
appellant, C. B. Rode & Co., and made an
argument attacking the act on the ground
of its unconstitutionality.
Considerable attention was paid by
other attorneys in court to one phase of
the case, which was presented by the
plaintiff, as follows:
We adhere to tbe proposition that under the
constitution tlie Legislature has no power 10
exempt from taxation any private property
whatsoever. If any practical inconvenience
shall result from our construction of the clause
in question, the remedy will be found in an
amendment to the instrument itself. It tl our
province to expound it as we find it, and not
to supply its omissions, if auy there be, by
forced interpretations.
Tnus it will be seen by the act approved
March 28, 1895. that the Assessor has the
right to .evy, seize and sell personal property
unsecured by v lien upon real estate on the
15th day of June, and the taxpayer who owns
tiie real estate has until October to pay his
taxes on his personal property. A law subject
ing one class of taxpayers to execution for
taxes due upon a certain date, while other
taxpayers are exempt from such executiou
until a later date, is unconstitutional.
The facts in the case were that Assessor
Siebe, May 20, 1895, demanded of the ap
! pellants the immediate payment of taxes
j upon certain personal property owned by
I them for the fiscal year beginning July 1,
1895, and threatened that unless the ap
pellants paid him the sum assessed against
them forthwith he would seize the prop
erty and sell it, or so much as was neces
sary to maKe the required sum. The As
sessor made an arbitrary assessment alter
tbe appellants had tiled and sworn to a
siatenient of their personal property. The
appellants contended that they had al
ready paid their personal property tax for
I the fiscal year 1^94-95, and that when the
assessment was demanded no tax had
been levied for the fiscal year 1895 96 ana
that t >c Assessor had no authority to col
lect taxes until the levy was made.
TEN VIOLENT DEATHS.
Coroner Hawkiu* KÂ«pt Buiy With Mur
der*, Suicides and Fatal â 
. / Accidents.
Ten inquests were held by Coroner
Hawkins in cases where people â  had met
with violent deaths. A verdict of acci
dental death was returned in the case of
John Hogan, who died! in , the Receiving
Hospital from a fracture of ! the * skull on ;
the 4th inst. ,; Hogan was a laborer, 45 years
of age, and lived at 1912% Mission- street.
Several days before his death' he was on a
hay- wagon on Oak and Devisadero streets
and was run into by an electric car. The
jury did not tnink that any one but Hogan
was to blame for the accident ?as he got
in tlie way of the car with his vehicle.
"Murdered by some unknown person,"
was the verdict returned ;in the case of
Chu Chang or Jung, who was shot to
death ou JacKSon street and St. Louis al
ley on the nicht oi December 23. De
ceased was Va fisherman f and \ the 'killing
was the outcome of lone of the highbinder
feuds among Chinese. \ ' . ' :".'.. .
: ; Otto G. Heuser, a native of Germany, 50
years of age, residing at 1364 ParK street,
Alnmeda, went to Golden : Gate ; Park ; : on
the 26th ult. and blew his brains out with
a revolver. A verdict of suicide ; was '; re
. turned. ' -' : - -'â¢â .'â ".:... â¢":. : .. : -. ...';'_ '.'.". â ".
On the 27th of last month there was a
fire in the California Glue .Works in South'
San Francisco 4 and Henry Hollier ? was
burned so badiy that he did not live long
thereafter. The jury thought that bis
death v was accidental. ;;;- :-M : r
, f * ; Late In the afternoon of December 28
the body of Lo How ; was found suspended
by a rope from the rafters of a small barn
in the rear of 808 Stockton 'street. A bul
let wound was found in the right side of
his head. \;t It was learned that there had
been a row aruone the Chinese at 808
Stockton street several evenings belore.
Tb> hanging of How to 'j the rafters was
evidently % a bungling attempt on the part
'of the murderers to lead the public to be
lieve that he had committed; suicide, but
the autopsy showed that it was.' the bullet
that killed the Chinaman and not the
rope. A verdict of murder by parties un
known was returned by the Coroner's jury.
Alonzo P. Bovd, who lived at 098 Twenty
fourth street, Oakland, committed suicide
with a revolver in a lodging-house at 719
Market street, this City, on December 28.
A verdict in accordance with the facts was
found. Deceased was 40 years old and a
naiive of Kentucky.
On November 1 F. W. Scheuricn, a shoe
maker living at 8 Virginia court, left his
home after sending a note to a friend that
he intended to end his life. On the 6th
inst. his body was found in the bay off
Lombard-street wharf. Suicide was the
verdict.
Trie jury returned a verdict of accidental
death in the case of Harry Hart, a bar
keeper at the New Western Hotel, at SOO
Kearny street. On January 1 Hart fell
over xhe railing while going upstairs in
the hotel and fractured his skull. Death
resulted the next day from his injuries.
He was 37 years of age.
Because the man she loved refused to
return her affection Barbara Groom took a
dose of carbolic acid that caused her death.
The tragedy happened on the 4:h inst. at
402 Geary street. She was 18 years of age
and came from Colusa. Suicide was the
verdict.
Coroner Hawkins and the jury dis
agreed on the verdict in the case of
Frank H. Brockman, who on the 2d snot
Marguerite Hoilis and then ended his life
with a bullet. The traeedy took place in
a saloon on McAllister and Leavenworth
streets. No one saw the shooting. He
shot the woman in the jaw and she is now
in the hospital, and then placed the
muzzle of the weapon in his own mouth
and blew his brains out. Previous to this
Brockman told his sister that lie intended
to commit suicide. All of these facts
were presented to the jury, but Miss
Hoilis was not able to be present and give
her testimony. However, the jury re
turned the following: "Owing to the lack
of evidence and believing that the proper
steps have not been taken in securing cvi- !
dence we. the jury, are unaDle to render a j
decision in this case."
Coroner Hawkins was not satisfied with
this return and refused to accept the same.
He took the legal right he has to ar
bitrarily decide questions under such cir
cumstances and signed % 'Suicide" to the
inquisition papers.
HEALTH STATISTICS,
Seinl-Annual Keport of the Secretary
of the Board of Health.
Trie semi-annual report of the Health
Department for the period ending Decem
ber 31 last has been prepared by the sec
retary of the Board of Health. The fact
of an unfavorable death rate in propor
tion to the birth rate is attributed to the
fact that physicians are remiss in report
ing births, and legislation on the matter
is recommended.
During the six months'ending December
31, 1896. the total number of deaths was
2997, an average of 9.06 per thousand.
The rates were: July 505, August 454,
September 466, October 506. November 463,
December 603. Of these 2743 were white,
1230 Mongolians find 24 colored. Married
1019, single 1595, widowers 144, widows 186,
unascertained 53. The to.al number of

erection of the new building corner of Geary
and Stockton streets, met with a serious acci
dent yesterday morning. He was working on
tiie first story clo.>e to the elevator well when
he was struck by the elevator as it was de
scending. He fell to the ground floor, a dis
tance of about twenty feet. The ambulance
was s unmoned and he was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where it was found that he
i Â»a< suffering from contusions of the side and
' back and possible internal injuries. He lives
at the Continental Hotel.

POWELL STREET IN
RED AND WHITE
A Prismatic Display Was
Produced Last
Night.
Night's Darkness Completely
Overcome by Arc
Lights.
A Dazzling Eff.ct Produced on the
Block Between Eddy and
Ellis Streets.
The long-expected electric display of
arc lights on Powell stre6t from Eddy to
Ellis was realized last night for the lirst
time.
The business men whose names have
already appeared in The Call were more
than gratified at the result of their enter
prise when they saw the dazzling effect
produced.
The artistic effect was most pleasant to
behold as the twelve white lightsâ six on
each side of the street â shone. To Rive a
prismatic effect to this strong l.ght fonr
red lamps were nun? over the center of
the street. Their subdued crimson rays
blended with the additional illumination
at the various stores and cafes and those
of the Baldwin Hotel.
A noticeable feature was the cream
colored lamps in the windows of Haub
Brothers' bakery and confectionery par
lors on the opposite side. These were par
ticularly admired, together with what may
be termed the headlight en the Columbia
Woolen-mill Clothing-store. The electric
illuminated Colombia Theater a l?w yards
farther north was made more conspicuous.
This wonderful transformation of that
one block attracted wide attention.
In the absence of Samuel H. Fried
lander, the president of the Powell-street
Improvement Club, who is on his way
from Portland, Or., the duties of superin
tending the illumination devolved on
Charles C. Haub of Hanb Brothers, who
assumed full charge on the declination of
Jacob J. Gottlob of the Columbia Theater,
whose business prevented him from taking
a prominent part in the management.
The contract with the electric light
company is for a period of six months,
with the provision that the six red lights
remain liphted during the entire night.
The white lights will be extinguished at
midnight.
The expense, which is so cheerfully
borne by all the business people on the
street, save one, amounts to $50 per week.
As an example of the progressive spirit
of the people on this block Haub Bros.'
gas and electric lijiht bills amount to $100
per month, and this sum is cheerfully paid
because of the increase of business since
they acded lights in their premises.

Lloyd, Rev. W. H. Wycofl , Key. L. L. Wirt.
After the opening exercises the reports
from the enurches were read which
showed all in a flourishing condition. A
number of short addresses were made by
the pastors upon the ministerial work in
their different charges.
Rev. G. C. Adams of the First Church,
San Francisco, spoke on the subject of I
"The Source ol Power." Prayer, he said,
was the true source and lrom tbis would
come and always had come the strength
of the cnurch.
Rev. C. E. Lloyd continued on the topic
and advocated work with prayer. Wnen
the officers and lay brethren labored with
their hands lor the upbuilding of the
church, that church received power.
Sometimes prayer was blocked. It did
not get high enough Decause something
was wrong at the outset. The church
needs wort prayer instead of mere lip
prayer.
Mr. Pond called attention to the follow
ing section in the conference constitution :
Wnen the standing of the minister of a
church of the conference is called in question
it shall be the duty of the committee 10 enter
talu specific charges from responsible persons,
to inquire into the case and report to the con
ference, which shall then proceed accordingly
to the scriptural methods and extent.
He then introduced the following as an
amendment to the section, which was
taken under consideration until the next
meeting:
When the standing ot a minister or of a
church of the conference is called in question,
it shall be the duty of this committee to enter
tain specific charges from responsible persons,
and after inquiry to report to the conference,
which may then at its discretion take steps to
secure the calling of an ecclesiestical council
to consider the matter, but that conference
snail never exercise legislation or judicial
authority nor consent to act as a counsel oi
reference.
Under the ruling of this amendment the
conference cannot act as an ecclesiastical
court for the trial of any one. The local
church hereafter would resolve itself into
a court and the conference would only act
if at all as an advisory board.
A resolution was unanimously adopted
indo#ing the establishment of a Conere
gational church headquarters in this city
as soon as possible, and a committee was
appointed consisting of Mr. Sadler of
Berkeley. Judge Havens of Oakland and
Deacon Barnard of San Francisco to make
all arrangements, principally the raising
of $25 per month for the maintenance of
the institution.
In the evening Rev. L. H. Hallock spoke
on "Methods Appointed and Approved,''
dealing with tne subject of revivals and
revival methods. His idea was that if the
pastor of a church prayerfully seeks di
vine power the revival would follow. The
steady ministry of personal influence he
thoueht to be more efficacious than spas
modic movements. He instanced the
period of seven years following and
including a revival season of Moody and
Bankey at Hartford, Conn., and said that,
although thousands were converted while
the revivalists worked, the total accessions
of church membership during the period
of seven years were less tnan in any other
seven years' period in a quarter of a cen-
turv.
Professor F. H. Fisher of the Pacific
Theological Seminary also spoke, deliver
ing an address on "The Historical Results
of Revivals."
A vote of thanks was extended to
Bethany Church for the hospitality ex
tended by its pastor and congregation to
the Bay Conference.
Rev. Dr. W. M. Martin of New York,
Rev. J. R. Nodellof San Bernardino, Rev.
W. C. McCarty of Washington and Rev. J.
B. Williams were elected corresponding
members.
On motion it was decided to hold the
next meeting of the conference at Paru
Church, San Francisco, on the second
Tuesday in April, to which date the meet
ing was adjourned.

THE CONSISTORY
COMMUNICATION
Masons of the Highest De
gree Meet in the Tem
ple To-Day.
A Brief Sketch of the Scottish
Rite on the Pacific
Coast.
Some of the Men Who Have Attained
Some of the Highest Honors.
Grand Registrar Hobe.
The annual communication of the
Grand Consistory, masters of the royal
secret, thirty-second dtgree, Ancient and
Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry of
the State of California, will be held in the
Masonic Temple in this City commencing
at 1 o'clock this afternoon.
The Grand Consistory represents one of
the highest degrees, of Freemasonry and
it requires a perfection of knowledge of
Masonry and Masonic law to enable a
candidate to receive the degrees that will
entitle him to a place in that high body.
Outside of the order there are but few
who have any conception of what the
Leant iiul work of the higher degrees is or
can appreciate it.
The Grand Consistory celebrated its
silver anniversary on the 12th of October,
1895, with a literary programme and
music, which was followed by a banquet
in the banquet hall of the temple. One of
the (.rand ministers of state in his annual
oration gave tne following very interest
ing review of the Ancient and Accepted
Scottish Rite of Freemasonry of the Pacific
Coast:
Scottish Freemasonry in this as well as in
the mother countries of England, Scotland and
Ireland erected its structure upon tue Blue
desrrees of the so-called "York Rite." From
tne earliest times, since the so-called '-Revival
of Freemasonry" in 1717. in the absorption
and uicdilicatfon ot the Blue degrees, freed
from the strain ot alternate Stuart and Han
overian bias, which divided the followers cf
the rival contestants tor the British crown in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and
which rent the Grand Lodge of England for
seventy-four years in twain into "Ancients"
and "Moderns," with bitter hatred and at
war with ench other â with divided streams of
Freemnsonry poured into Ihe American colo
nies, that were never united in this country
until after the War of the Revolution for
American independence, and which sev
ered all Masonic as well as poluicul alle
giance to the mother country, when
"American Union Lodge No. 1," set up
for it>elf and formulated und modified its
rituals, lectu res, charges and jurisprudence:
each State Improving and changing the work
to suit itself, and to assert its sovereign author
ity over its own territory. Thus we inherited
American Freemansonry from our patriotic
fathers of the Revolution, at whose head as its
noblest exemplar was the "Father oi his Coun
try," the immortal Washington.
The spirit of liDerty, equality and fraternity
pervaded the military lodges ot Freemasonry
that accomp&nitd the Continental Army, in
which many of the soldieisof our then French
allies embraced the opportunity of becoming
members, including Lafayette and other dis
tinguished generals and officers, and they
affiliated with the brethren on their return to
France, where our patriotic brother, Benjamin
Franklin, Has Embassador to that country,
and while serving his own in that official ca
pacity was also actively engaged in Masonic
work in the lodges of Paris.
Our Scottish rite, including the rite of Per
fection came from Fruncft to America ahnost
as i any as the Blue degrees from England and
Scotland; but immediately after the Reign oi
Terror, wneu all the regular Masonic bodies
were wiped out of existence in France, and all
authority ceasing, the deputy inspector-gen
eral of the Grand Consistory of Paris, under
original patents of authority, propagated the
rite in tne French Went Indies and along the
Atlantic coast of America, when at Charleston,
S. &, on May 31, 1801, there then being no
other authority but themselves in tne rite,
and those of the same rank, assumed full sov
ereign uowers and constituted themselves into
the "Supreme Council of the thlrtv-third de
gree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish rite
of Freemasonry for the United Statei of Amer
ica," and from which all regular supreme
councilsof the world immediately or mediately
have their origin.
The work of propagating the Scottish
Rite of Freemasonry on the Pacific Coast
dates back to the latter half of the sixtias,
when it was commenced in San Francisco
by the late 111. .â¢. E. H. Shaw, thirty-third
degree, who had been elected and crowned
active inspector-general for California.
On the 12th of July, 1868, a petition waÂ»
presented to the active ilispector-general
lor a charter to open a lodee of Perfection
to be known as Yerba Buena Lodge of
Perfection.
On the 13th of July of that year the
lodge waÃ instituted Dy 111. .*. E. H.
Shaw with the assistance of the 111.
.â¢â¢ Thomas H. Cassweil in due form, Ben
jamin H. Freeman being its first venerable
master. William T. Reynolds its senior
warden and George T. Grimes its junior
warden. The venerable master resigned
on the 12th of November, 1869, and on the
19th William S. Moses, who in later years
with hia wife lounded the Order of the
Eastern Star on this coast, was elected
venerable master. He, on account of busi
ness winch called him away to Yreka, re
signed on the 11th of November, 1870. On
the3oihof December of that year George
j. Hobe was elected venerable master, and
he tilled the office for three years and six
months. At the time he took office the
GEORGE J. HOBE, Thirty-Third Degree, Grand Registrar, Grand
Consistory of California *
cost of the degrees were so excessively hlph
that ttiey were almost prohibitive, and
the lodge had taken in but few members,
comparatively, so he suggested that the
fees t>e reduced to the minimum fixed by
the Supreme Council. It was argued that
such a step meant ruin, for to adopt his
susreestion was to reduce the fees from
$125 to $25, and he was asked not to press
t lie matter. He did, however, press his
proposition, assuring those who opposed
him that there would be no loss, but on
the contrary a gain. The soundness of his
judgment in this, as in other matters con
nected with the order, was made mani
fest, for from the time the fees were re
duced the membership increased rapidly
and m a marked degree.
It was not all smooth sailing in the
early stages of propagating the rite on
this coast as it appears from the language
of the orator already quoted. He said :
The spurious clandestine invasion of the At
wood Supremo Council of New York, which
lias found lodgment here, was promptiy sup
pressed; thosfe brethren who had become con
nected with it hero at that time, finding it to
be fraudulent, at once witbdn-w lrotn it, and
some of them applied for and received the de
grees of our rite from competent authority,
and the field was cleared and prepared for the
cower; and within three years, wiih the aid of
111. â¢â¢. Brother Thomas H. Caswell, thirty-third
degree (now grand commander), no less than
nineteen bodies of the rife, with aboui 150
members, had been constituted in this State,
besides four others in the State of Nevada, by
tne same authority.
Printed and written rituals of Freemasonry
were comparatively unknown excepting on
the continent of Europe and South America.
They were of course a startling surprise and
novelty to our members, while to learn and
memorize them was apparently a mountain of
labor to those who belonged to the higher
bedies of the rite, and ton great to be under
taken by many who were old Masons, who
looked upon the curriculum of Scottish Free
masonry as the study of a lifetime and be
yond their capacity to master it, and requir
ing so much valuabie time to Decome ac
quainted with it, which they were unable to
spare or disposed to give. â¢ * *
This Grand Consistory was organized by the
demand of the brethren to cive the rite a gov
erning body in thin Kate, the wisest measure
that was ever put into action by Scottish Free
masonry, even although it is but the deputy
of the Supreme Council, to govern the subor
dinate bodies only and confer the thirty-first
and thirty-second degrees.
Thomas H. Caswell, thirty-third depree,

MRS. McROBERTS' DEATH.
Farther Details of the Demise in Eng
land of a Well-Known San Fran
cisco Lady.
The following particulars of the sudden
death of Mrs. Mary McÃoberts. wife of a
weil-known journalist, formerly of this
City, and herself prominent in social, edu
cational and charitable circles here, ap
peared in the Leeds Mercury (England)
under date of the 4th ult. :
The Sudden Death of Mrs. McÃoberts at
Darlington. â An inquest was held yesterday
ai the Imperial Hotel by Mr. Proud, coroner,
to inquire into the death of Mary Fraser Mc-
Roberts, about 50 years of age, who died sud
denly on Tuesday afternoon. D. J. McKoberts,
journalist, husbaud of the deceased, deposea
10 going out on Tuesday afternoon and U aviug
his wife well, but on returning an hour later
he found her lying nenr tne fender before the
fire, and on calling in medical aid she was
lound to be dead. She had always been a re
markably heaithy woman. Frank Moore Cow
per deposed to seeing Mrs. McKoberts ail right
a little while before she was lound dead, after
her husband had gone out. Dr. A. W. Hare
found that life had expired when he Hrrived.
There was an abrasion on the left side of the
face and ear, caused probably by the deceased
failing against the fender; but from the post
mortem neld, it was clear that apoplexy was
the cause oi death, as the anery by the neck
near the brain had burst, causing blood to
flow rapidly over the brain and resulting in
almost instant death. The tendency to apo
plexy at deceased's age would be increased by
the brilliant abilities she had displayed. Ver
dict, death from apoplexy. Mrs. McKoberu'
remains are to be cremated at Manchester.
MEN AND HOfiSES MIXED.
F. C. Johnson Very Badly Injured by a
Jiiuiaway at Fine Street.
A peculiar and serious accident hap
pened about 2:30 o'clock yesterday after
noon at Kearny and Pine streets. People
on the outskirts of the big crowd, which
quickly assembled, said the man who lay
groaning upon the ground had been run
over by a streetcar, but this time a street
car was not to biame.
P. C. Johnson, who has a route on The
Call, and J. L. Baar, proprietor of the
Grant-avenue lunch parlor, were crossing
Kearny at Pine street. A boy who had
been leading a horse up the Pine-street
bill, let the horse eet away from him.
The animal became frightened and dashed
down Pine street. Turning north on
K^arny, the horse slipped on the
asptialtum pavement and fell down. The
animal's legs extended under the team of
v passing truck, and in falling he struck
Johnson and Baar, carrying them down
with him. Horses, men and truck were
mixed up together in an instant.
Johnson was hadly injured. He could
hardly speak. He thinks the horse kicked
or struck him in the back. He was carried
into a drugstore nearby where a stimu
lant was given him. After a wbile be was
able, to sit in a cnair without assistance.
His face was also slightly bruised ani out.
Mr. Baar was pretty badly shaken up, but
was not seriously injured. Mr. Jounson
was taken to his home, at 218 Locust ave
nue, in a carriage, Mr. Baar accompany
ing him. It is thought the former has
several ribs broken.

Tttey Desire the Legislature to Pass

The citizens of Alameda, through the

' the efforts now on foot to have the city's
right to sell electric light to its inhabi
tants declared illegal as a first step
toward having a private corporation take
control of the !i?ht supply, both for the
streets and residences.
Alameda ha* a valuable electric plant
and t&3 recently improved it at a cost ol
$20,000. For two years it has been doing
â 'â¢ efficient and economical service, but there

JAKE RUDOLPH
INDICTED AGAIN
The Man With a Gun Will
Have to Stand Trial
Again.
A Beach Warrant Issued â The '
Female P.ck pockets Charged
With Rotb.Ty.
Jake Riur's Case Sti 1 Hanging Fire.
The Grard Jury Hunting the
Holders of Sinecures.
"Jake' Rudolph was indicted by the
Grand Jary yesterday for assault with a
deadly weapon. A bench warrant was
i by Judge Slack for his arrest.
Bonds wece fixed at $3000.
The prosecuting witness in the case is
Henry Leslie. At 2 o'clock on the
morning of December 29 Kudolpb shot at
and wounded Leslie near the corner of
Valencia and Sixteenth streets. Rudolph
was airested snortly after on Guerrero
street and taken to tne Seventeenth-street
sta>ion. He was auerwarJ released on
bonds.
R.udolph was at one time a euide and
bodyguard to Chris Buckler. It was he
who sloi at J. B. E.iot, business manager
of the Chronicle, some time ago, and only
missed an indictment for murder as a
result of the builet eiancing from a piece
of money in Mr. E. lot's pocket
Rudolph was examined and adjudged
insase by the insanity Commissioners at
that time and sent to an asylum, wnere
he remained two years, and was then dis
charged as entirely cured. Since then he
has been abroad at ail times with bus pis
tol,.and has been several times, while
drunk, prevented by the heroic efforts of
friends from assaulting individuals who
Â«d to cross him.
An indictment was also found against
!' Annie Pickeit and Mamie Bonner, the
_: women who picked $410 'rom the
cet of George H:IL Annie Pickett is
â  lockup, having been arrested in Sac
ramento. A bench warrant has been is
sued fOr the arrest of her confederate, who
ha 3 succeeded thus far in evading arres:.
The bonds in these cases were fixed at
f2OOO.
The case of Jake Raver, against wbom
â  charges have been preferred of forgery and
! obtaining money under faise pretense?, is
stlli under investigation by she jury. It
Â« understood that the charge oi :orgery
, has been passed and that the jury is now
inquiring esp cialiy into the allegations
that Raver received more money from the
'sale oi Hannah Jones' millinery estab
lishment than be had a cam for. Otto
turn Saaen makes the charge cf forgery,
alleging that Raaer took out a writ cf exe
cution under Turn Baden' a ns-me without i
authority. Bauer declares that tie had
..authority directly from Turn Suden him
se:f, and furtbei that he signea Turn Sa
tien's name "per Eauer." Attorney Nagie
appscrcd before .lie jury to present the
other charge of obtaining money under
false pretenses. Bauer claims that he
could explain this away in a moment â
that it was tin error caused by the imper
fect record left by Turn Suden. the
woman's attorney.
The standing committees cf the jury are
it work in their special lines. The expert |
has been at work on the books of the
Board of Education for some .i ays. Tne
:ommi:tee Will inqui:e inio the methods ;
A spending money in vogue with the
boardâ whether the luxuries of higher ed
ucation have been introduced to the d is- ,
a tdvanuge of the children at large in the
I ward schools.
"1 -*â  committee was also Tester in- i
XJracted to inquire as to the duties of the ;
Fish and Game Warden and discover ;
whether or not that official was a real !
necessity or has a sinecure. The duties of i
'.he Gas Inspector will also be inquired '
into and reported upon.
Voting Machine Incorporation.
Articles cf incorporation of the California I
Toting Machine Company were filed in the i
ment which would place their right Ito j
continue that municipal ownership, which (
they have found so satisfactory in the j
past, beyond the reach of dispute.
In this fight for municipal ownership I
Alameda has already achieved a decided I
â  victory. When the board of trustees de- j
1 cided to improve the old Jenney plant, |
they were opposed by an injunction. This
injunction was set 'aside. The State law
| also specifically grants to cities of the j
j sixth class the right that Alameda. which,
belongs to the next class higher, wishes to
feel secure in exercising.
C. E. Lloyd, from whom the old Jenney
plant was purchased, is believed to be the
man most active in instigating the oppo
sition.
It is calculated by the league that the
! city's continued control of the electric
I lighting will result in the reduction of tax
: ation 10 to 15 per cent, and thai it will be
I able to furnish an arc-light system of
; street-lighting free of cost to the* taxpay
i ers. The petition runs:
CARD TO THE FTBLIC.
The Municipal Ownership League of Ala
j meda solicits at the hands of the Legislature
! an amendment which will in specific terms
; give to the city of Aiameda the right to sell to
; it* citizens e.ectricity for purposes ol light.
; beat ana power.
In the endeavor to secure the passage of this
amendment the league hopes and expects to
have the support of the whole State, excepting
1 only those whose private, personal interests
are at variance with public ownership.
We therefore desire to place our cause before
the people at large as weu a* before the Legis
; lature Itself.
For more than eight years the city o( A1&
--i meds. has .owned its electric light plant.
j Within the past two years the Board of
, Trustees of the city determined to enlarge the
plant by adding engines and dynamo of tbe
most approved pattern and enlarging the
; building to contain them.
Upon this determination being announced,
suit was brought by J. T. Fleming, a citizen of
; Aiameda, to enjoin the Trustees trom making
: the proposed improvements and paytue money
tr.erefor. The case of Fleming vs. Foraerer et
t eL (ihe defendants being the Trustees of the
' city oi Alameda) was adjudicated before Hon.
' A. L. Prick, who dissolved the temporary mi
i junction which he had granted, and decided
is favor of the city, holding that the City
Trustees had the power to make tre proposed
; improvements, inasmuch as from the testi
: mony it appeared that the said improvements
i wÂ«?re necessary for the better lighting of the
streets and for pumping water for street
â  sprinkling, but statingâ (and to this we desfre
; to draw particular attention)â toat the law
I gave them no authority to sell electricity for
private use.
Inasmuch as mis point was not at issue in the
; case, this statement of the learned Judge may
be regarded as obiter dictum. la fact it is so
: regarded by our City Attorney, E. Taylor
j Esq., and by our Board of City Trustees. For
! the city is continuing to *c.l 'light as hereto
fore, and since the enlargement of the plant
has been completed is supplying to all citi
zens who desire i; incandescent* as rapidly as
i the necessary connections can be made-
It is contended by our City Attorney that the
learned Judge was in error in suiting that the
; sale of electricity lor lighting by the city to
j citizens is an illegal exercise ot power, and he
j is supported by many able lawyers in the be
lie: that sudivision 13 of sec. 764 of the
Political Code by implication comers all
| necessary authority tor such action.
Nevertncless the threat of interested parties
[ hangs over the city that tne Trustees will be
I prevented from making such sic.
.Hence the desire on the part of the citizens
: of Alameda to hÂ«ve the statute amended so as
to give, in specific tones, tfce desired power.
It is worthy of note that in 1891 the Legisla
ture amended the law so as to grant to cities

The prospects are that the benefit meet
, of the League of American Wheelmen, to j
be held at the Velodrome track next
I Saturday afternoon, will be the best ever
held here. Arrangements have been made
-o that should it rain that day the meet
will be neM one week later, beats will be
', on sale to-day at Sherman Â«fc Clay's, and a
' large advance sale is expected on account
of the rush of the clubs :or front seats in
I blocks. The entry list includes all the
crack riders who have been â  competing
, here, and in the amateur ranks particu
larly there will be some pretty finishes,
with Kenna, Kuss, Cook. Mott, inquires.
Crafts and others lined uo for the finals.
â â  The professionals are training at she track
every morning and afternoon, and alt are
in speedy condition. There will be a t
pretty contest for the Velodrome shield
between Whitman of Los. Angeles and
Dow of Seattle, with the chances slightly
in favor of Whitman. The entries are
now :n tbÂ« hands of Official Handicapper ,
fcmytb, who will announce his distance
allotments to-day.

Albert G. de Vincent, who two years
ago ras a candidate for the Assembly on
tne People's party ticKet, and George
Smith were arrested early yesterday
morning by Policeman M. F. Joy, oa
charges of disturbing the peace.
About 5 o'clock in the morning they
went into a restaurant oa the corner of
Post and Lark in streets md ran cp a bill
for $2. They declined t.o pay the bill, and
the restaurant keeper went outside and
blew his police whistle.
Joy and a citizen responded and they
had " considerable trouble in placing De
Vincent and Smith under arrest. At the
City Prison both gave their occupation as
that of a laborer. De Vincent is a clerK
in a shoestore.
The cases were called in Judge Low's

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1897.
of the sixth class the very power which Ala
meda, a city of the fifth class, is new seeking
to have definitely coMerrei upon it. So the
anomaly is presented of a city of one class
having power expressly conferred u^on it
which is not express y conferred upon a city
of the next higber class.
While it is to the interest of private corpo
rate capital to obtain a monopoly oi the
whole electric service of the city of Alameda,
the agents thereoi do not announce that as
their intention. They recognize the fact that
the city is strongly intrenched in its position
and their attack is directed to the weakest
point of that entrenchment. That weakest
point is in tiie lack of explicit authority con
ferred by law upon me city to sell electricity
to its citizens. And in their hopes the city's
opponents have received encouragement by
the obiter dictum of Judge Fnek, heretofore
reterrea to.
We ari led to expect strong opposition to the
pxMtige of the proposed amendment. Much
money has already been spent by those whose
interests are antagonistic to the city, and they
have yet a large iur.d :o draw uron. They
will not make an open fight. They will tight
as heretofore, under cover. Their endeavor
will be to prevent the bill from coming to a
vote. They will lose no opportunity to delay
i: in committees and on the tiies of the Senate
and Assembly. For ;hey know that if it once
comes to a final vote i; will carry by a large
majority.
We are also Informed that an effort will be
! made by the same Interests tosmugele in an
amendment prohibiting all municipal corpo
' rations from selling to their citizens electricity
â  for lighting or other purposes.
A word as to the organization which makes
, this appeal. . â 
I The Municipal Ownership League of Ala
i medals a body having a membership of over
i 700 voters, citizens ol Alameda. It is made up
without regard to political lines, and on in
! executive committee each of the three leading,
i political parties iÂ« represented. It is not a
club of typical reformers. The majority of its
1 members are conservative men, some of them
i u:trs-conservailve. Many os them are wealthy
and prominent citizens. â¢ *
The present law (section 704, subdivision 13.
! Political Code! reads: 'The Board of Trustees
i of such city shall have power â¢ * â¢ to con-
I struct and maintain and to permit tne con
j struction and maintenance of â¢ â¢â â¢ electric
j light lines therein."
A bill containinz the amendment desired by
I the leacue has beer, drawn by the City Attor
ney of Alameda. E. K. Taylor Esq. It hÂ«s been
I introduced in the Senate by Senator John L.
Beard, and Is known as Senate bill No. 9. It has
; also been introduced in the Assembly by Hon
! orable James A. Waymire, and is there known
'as Assembly bill No. V2l. It proposes to
; amend sertion 76-1 of the Political Code by add
j ing to subdivision 3 thereof the following:
I â¢â¢To purchase, lease or construct water works
; and electric plant and all machinery, conduc
' tors and appliances necessary therefor; and to
| supply said city with and to sell to the inhab
itants thereof water, light, heat and power."
We appeal to the friends of municipal in
, dependence, we appeal to all who wish to see
I the cities ot this State freed from private cor-
I porate contro , to join with us in this fight.
i Ours is a contest for the principle of munici
i pal ownership, which, principal was indorsed
. by every political convention in our county
; and by many others of the State during the
' last campaign. .
We ask the press throughout the State to
â  give us their support. We ask all who are In
I sympathy with us to a.d in pushing our pro
[ posed legislation to a successful issue.

ANSELMO WANTS
A FULL FOURTH
â 
Another Branch of Litiga
tion in the Laveaga
:| Case.
I The Young Man Wishes to Inherit
a Share of H s Use c's \-
Estate.
Suit Brought to Test His Standing
as Heir to His Father's
Brother.
Attorney J. J. Dwyei has filed the ap
plication of Anseimo Jose Maria de
Laveaga for a share of the million-dollar
! estate of Jose Vtncente de Laveaga, de
ceased.
Anseimo admits that Maria Joseph
' Cebrian, Maria Concepcion de Laveaga
an! Miguel A. de Laveaga are some of the
i.ex: of kin of the deceased, bat be ob
jects to the exclusion of himself from the
list of those, entitled to inherit a part of
the estate. In fact he demands a fourth
of what is leit of the properly after pay- j
ing certain legacies, alleging tha: be <
. stands as the representative of bis de- j
ceased father. Jose Maria de Laveaga, â¢
who was a brother of Jose Vincente de
[ Laveaga.
Tne relationship of the brothers is not
disputed, nor is itfleni d that Jose Maria
: de Laveaga was the father of Anseimo. j
ITh question in dispute is as to the legal !
standing of Anselmo as to nis heirstnp
because he was Dora out of wedlock.
Tne facts are established by the petition
of the youn/ nan. He files a copy of his [
lather's will to prove that his talker was
never married and that his mother was
Basilia Sanchez, wbo died in Mexico soon
after tne birth of her son, the claimant.
. That JoÂ»e Maria de Laveaga did suffi
; ciently legitimize hi? son Anselmo is not
â  denied either, as his nets were ample in
that regard. On May 24, 1373, he signed a.
declaration which was witnessed by Dr.
! Wilhelm Dohrmann, Anselmo's footer
lather, and F. A. Schroder, in which, j
speaking of Anselmo. the following pas- I
sage occurs:
I hereby repeatedly acknowledge and con
firm him with all bis legal claim* of inherit
ance and other rights and consequences con
nect i with and in law and justice arising out
of tr.is, my acknowledgment, whlca an own
ton may have.
Mr. D'.vyer said that under the decisions
in the Jessiip and Biythe case* the legiti- i
mz:ng of Anselnio was complete, end no j
oue would dispute his right to inherit
Iron his father, but in ibis case his father j
died before bis unc c died, and the point i
is i*4; -e<.t that Ans-lmo has not the legal i
right to inherit from his unÂ«:ie. It is to
test this poiit tha: the present proceed
ings are bad.
An effort was made to secure a distribu- ;
tion of the Laveaga estate yesterday, but
Mr. Dwyers interposition blocked" pro
ceedings in that direction. Large be
quests to charitable institutions were
made, and the bulk of the estate was di
rected to be set aside in trust for the
fou r>. ding of a deaf and dumb and blind asy
lum, bat this *as declared void, and the
greater part of the property goes to the
relatives of the dectdent.
V ung Anseimo was bequeathed $20,000
in bis nnce'i will. If be succeeds m es-
tablishinz his right to stand as the repre
sentative of his father he will be entitled
to one-fourth of the residue, which would
make Ills share amount to over $150,000.
A Justice Cited.
Justice of the Peace Carroll hat involved
himself in a little controversy by his friend
ship for State Senator Eugene F. Bert, as is
evidenced by a complaint filed in the Su
perior Court Yesterday by the Ames <Sc Frost
Company. The plaintiff alleges that it has a
suit aga.nst the Pacific Cycle Company and
others pending in Justice Carroll's court, and
that an immediate trial is desired, but that
Justice Carroll has allowed a continuance of
two months, solely because Mr. Bert, the at
torney on the other side, is in Sacrnmen to at
tending a session of the Legislature. Judge
Seawelt has ordered J as' tee Carroll to snow
cause why he does not proceed with the trial,
the writ to be returned on the 23d inst.
WILL SUE FOR
RIGHTS OF WAY
Condemnation Proceedings
Ordered by the Valley
Road.
On Their Determination Con
struction Work to Bakers
field Will Begin.
Material and Money Eaoufh Avail
able to Put Their Road Through '
Without Delay.
As the result of the visit last week of
the directors of the Valley road to Fresno
and the country immediately south of
that city, it is likely that construction
work south of Fresno, on the proposed ex
tension of the road to Bakersfieid, will
soon be commenced.
So far as the new road is concerned,
every preparation has been made to take
up the construction worK and press it to
completion at the earliest possiole day.
Material is stacked up at Fresno almost
sufficient to build the entire distance be
tween that town and the intended south
ern terminus of the great rival of the
Southern Pacific Company. There is said
to be also ample means available to put
the road through without waiting for the
sa!e of the $6,000,000 worth of bonds which
are shortly to be issued.
The only obstacle in the way is the right
iof way. Owing to the annoyances ex
perienced in constructing the line between
Stockton and Fresno, oy not having a
ri^hi of way clear through between theÂ«&
points, it is the determination of the di
rectorate not to begin operations on the
Fresno-Bakersfield extension until they
i possess this requisite.
At the present time the entire ripht of
i way has virtually been secured to Bakers
| field by way of Hanford. But there are
i three "holdings through wilicb the privi
! lege of running the line has not been se
: cured, despite long - continued negotia-
J tion*. '.";.
It was to look into these cases and to
j take a general survey of the righi-01-way
I situation that the trip of the directors was
i made lust week.
One of the obdurate land-owners is lo
cated just souiii of Fresno and the other
two are south of Kings Ktver. Every effort
was made by the directors to' settle the
! matter, but without avail. In conse-
I quence, at the regular metting of the
board yestenlay a resolution was passed
| authorizing tne institution of condemna
j tion suits against the properties in ques-
I lion. These will be commenced at once
and as soon as they are settled, provided
no new difficulties of this nature arise a",
o the r points, active work will begin.
Rights of way through Visalia, via
Reedley, are in fair shape and no serious
' obstacle ii anticipated alone this route.
BASE AND LOFTY THOUGHTS
Writing Too Freely Causes Kobert Ham
ilton to Be Scut to
Jail.
Robert Ha mil the saloon-keeper who.
was convicted a few days ago of sending
improper letters through the mail to a
j Mrs. Scully who lived on McAllister street.
I was sentenced to six months'imprison
ment in the 'Alameda County Jail by Dis
trict Judge Morrow yesterday. Five years
is the maximum sentence for such of
fenses, but the Jud=;e,let Hamilton off
light, as he said thai the m .n was not the
only one to blame. Scui.y has recently
obtained a divorce from his wile. Judge
Morrow in passing sentence took occasion
! to state that such correspondence, while
being against good morals, is also very
dangerous, and people should be careful
as to what their letters contain before de
positing them In Uncle tarn's letter-boxes.
Tnere was a curious feature to this case
I which showed to what extremes the hu
-1 man mind can go. In "writing to Mrs.
! Scully Hamilton frequently burst forth
| into eloquence of the higher order. One
i sample in particular arrested the atten
: tion of Judge Morrow, the lawyers and
I Federal officials. The woman had evi
dently asked the man's blessing, the occa
sion Dein.-, it was believed, to nave been
; the anniversary of tier birth. To tnis re
-1 quest Hamilton responded:
By the by. May, I send yon this. blessing
! and I trust everything will come to pais as I
have written it.
May the blessings of thy God attend thee;
I may the sun of glory shine around thy head;
may the gates ot plenty, honor and happiness
, be always open to thee and thine; may no
strife disturb thr days nor any sorrow disturb
thy nignrs; may the pillow of peace kiss thy
checks aau pleasure or- imaginations attend
thy dreams, and when length ol years makes
thee tired of earthly joys Â»uU the curtains of
â¢ death rre Rent y closing * around the last
i scenes of thy existence, may the angels of God
attend thy bed And take care that the expir
ing lamp of life shall not receive one rude ast
to nasten its extinction, and, finally, may the
Savior's blood wash thee from all impurities
' a:, i at last usher thee iato the land of ever-
I lasting felicity." Amen. : -â /?Â£-â¢;-;
Several were inclined to believe that the
blessing was merely a quotation, but none
could tell from . whose pen it emanated.
: It was submitted to several people of let
\ ters, and more than one was inclined to
believe that it was original with the man
: whose v.ieness 13 the cause of his im
prisonment. \

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top flgnrwt
et station indicate maximum temperature for tha
days: those underneath it. If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredth.-!,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pmn s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means hljth barometric pressure and
is usually acconiDanled by fair weather: "low"
rÂ»fers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weatherand. rains.
"Lows" ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
'and low along the coast, ami the isobars extend
north and south alone the coast, rain is probable:
but when thÂ» "low is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" In the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, winner
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
. Will produce an opposite result.

.NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 12.-There was a
slight failing off in the volume of trading at the
Stock Exchange to-day, the sales amounting to
1 1f,659 shares against 214 000 shares yesterday.
In to-day 'a total sugar figured for 17,700 shares,
Union Pacific for 12 900 and Wheeling and Lake
Kiie for 11.800. The market displayed strength
throughout, the si~ntng of the arbitration . reaty
by representatives of the United States and Great
Britain and the improved outlook for general
business having exerted a favorable influence.
The standard issues moved up gradually, and at
the end of the session a few stocks showed gains of
1419% cent. Leather (preferred), sugar, Chi
cago gas, Tennessee coal, (Grangers', Manhattan
and Reading were all prominent in the upward
movement, sugar so dup to within a fraction of
113, the reduction of l-16c in certain grades of
T< fined sugar and the coffee war at the West being
ignored by operators. Leather prefened rose
. &{jc to 61% con covering of shorts,
lennessee Coal rose from 26% to 28% on the
. announcement mat strong interests wl I be repre
semeu in the directory in thf fntur". The directors
cretom-et to-morrow to niakelmpnrtnn changes
in the board. Union Pacific was better supported
Â«nd rallied a point to 7S<g. Reports from rtasli
ing;on were 10 the effect tnat >the (iovernment, In
view of the defeat of the fundiiiK bill, would heg n
foreclosur- Droceedings at once. London was a
s-li r. and, according io estimates, parted with
m-ar y 10,000 shares of various siock. The offer-
Ings were quickly absorbed and made no impres
sion on p uei.
The feature of the day, however, was the break I
in Ulii'i-nni; Hud Luke Erie, the common drop- '
pI"K from 51/2 id 35/ :jj>4y 8 and the preferred from
â¢/35/g to i6<yvig/17V2- 1 lie decline of prices was the
result of a rumor mat application had been made
for a receiver. Th.a whs not cod firmed, although It
is generally adiuuted that the demoralization In
1 he bituminous coal trade has affected all the soft
coal carriers- Long Island stock was dull until
just 1 efore the close when 400 shares were sold at

CHICAGO MAKKKTS.
CHICAGO, 111.. Jan. 12.â Wheat opene I firm
th s morning, but shortly afterward yielded to
I free telling of loug wheat. When that pressure
I was removed from the market it strengthened and
j advanced ,to better figures than were quotable at
I the start. Liverpool did not decline qui.e as much
] as was expected, and that with reported buying
I here by foreigners and the snle of 100,000 bushels
] ca^h wheat for shipment abroad were the forming
influences. The sentiment remained bearish, how
ever, and the inclination was to depress rather
than elevate values. Receipts in the Northwest
were liberal. at 330 cars, against 149 last Tuesday
and 310 a year ma Chlcrgo had 41 cars and in
spected out 24,911 bushels.
The tone displayed quite a little improvement
later, and an advance to the call price took place,
but selling against those or vileges prevented any
further rise. Export clearances were moderate it
231,367 bushels. Closing Continental cables were
lower. May wheat open c! from 80% to 8')8. 8 . *old

CORNâ movement in 'corn was slow and j

place and they were generally in reflection of the I
direction shown by wheat. I lveri>ool cab.es were

bushels were taken from store. Exports were
51,750 bushels. May corn opened at 245/ eC, sold

THE LIQUOR "ADS"
The Fair Sex Engage in
the "Blue and Gold"
Controversy.
A Meeting That Was Expected,
but Which Did Not
Materialize.
The L'oyd-Unda Ca,eâ A New Fire
Marshal to Be Appointtd
Socn.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 12.â Manager
Mott of the "Bine and Gold" bas iound
himself entangled in the meslies oi the
co-eds' wrath. The young women at the
State University have taken up the light
inaueurated by the college Y. M. C. A.
against the publication of liquor "ads"
in the college annual and they propose
â¢waging a vigorous campaign against hav
ing the "B & G" "polluted," as they say,
"with the vile and debasing lines, setting
forth the merits of the goods of various
saloon and liquor men." The Young
r.an's Christian Association will hold
a meeting next Friday, at which the mem
bers intend to pass resolutions condemning
the practice of publishing liquor "ads"
and will prepare themselves for a battle
with those who approve of the system.
It was expected that a meeting of the
class of '98 10 discuss the matter would be
held this afternoon, but for some un
known reason it was not held. President
Everett Brown says that he wishes, as
iho presiding officer, to be perfectly neu
tral in the matter. He has had overtures
from President Falrchild of the Y. M. C.
A. for the calling of a meeting, while on
the other hanu he has been requested by
many not to call such a meeting, as they
say "that the measure will surely meet
with defeat.
"I am only too willing tc get the ciass
together,'' said he to-day, "ii I think the
majority wishes it, but as far as I am able
to see only the members of thÂ° Y. M. C.
A. and Y. W.C. A. object to the ads.
"I would like to see the matter settled
cutside of a cla?s-meetine, for just as cer
tain as we bring tue matter up officially
i: wiil terminate in a bie fight and will be
a 'josh' on the colle-ze. The Y. M. C. A.
ought to settle this matter with Manager
JMott and not try to bring a large number
of students, wno now appear indifferent,
into the case."
The liquor "ads" are the tain of the
campus, and no one seems to know how
or where the matter will end. Some of
ti;e Y. M. C. A. have attempted to enlist
certain members of the faculty in their
cause, but without avail, because the pro
fessors say that the question is one which
tioes not concern them.
Meanwhile the "ad" solicitors are goinc
alons resardless of the quasi injunction of
the Y. M. and the Y. W. C A. '

oft-repeated troubles in that district.

Anti- Saloon League Flies a Complaint
With the Trustees Against

ALAMEDA, Cal.. Jan. 12.â L. J. Seliier
of 1732 A ameda avenue, his daughter,
Miss Annie, and Miss Nora Harnden, will
leave Saturday morning for a two years'
stay in Paris. The most interesting part
of the affair is the runior that Miss Harn
den is either a bride now or will be before
the start is made on Saturday.
The utmost secrecy prevails at the Sel
lier residence, but some of the family
claim that there has b^en an engagement
for some time. Mr. Seliieris a mining
expert, 64 years of ace, while the bride, or
bride to be, who is weli known in society,
is but 2-i years cf age. It was the desire
of the contracting parties that the an
nouncement of the marriage might be
delayed until the party was well on its
way," but the good news would not keep,
so they will now be able to carry with
them the good wishes of their many
friends.
Mr. Sellier, when interviewed, denied
the rumors point blank, as many another
man in a similar nosuion has, but his
married daughter was more accoiumo
datio& She admits the engagement, but
declined 10 j:ive any particulars of the
event.

Be Called Down by-

sition to Secure Good City

Most Important Action Yet Taken in

;
Oakland Office B an Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 12. , j
The breach between Dr. Pardee and his
followers and Frank A. Leach and his
supporters is widening daily, and each
side expresses no desire for peace. Anony
mous Interviews and generalities are being
freely circulated and printed, but definite
Tacts are not particularly plentiful.
Mr. Leach considers that an interview
with a member of the Committee of Twen
ty-one published in this morning's Call
Two Oakland Republicans Who Are Just Now in the Public Eye
of Oakland.
did him an injustice and credited him
with making political alliances which he
considers discreditable. Considering the
virile manner in which local politics have
been for years and are being carried on,
this statement is somewhat of a surprise
to the politicians. Mr. Leach evidently
thought that remarks passed upon his
personal stand in politics referred to his
business enterprise and character. Such,
however, couli not be the deduction de
rived from an impartial renew of the situ
ation.
In his explanation published to-night
he says: "These publications certainly de
mand some response from the Enquirer.
Reluctant as we may be to say things that
must cause heartburnings and engender
passion, that should never find place in
the discussion of politics or the fitness of
men for public office; therefore, ws shall
give another chapter of this most unpleas
ant subject and it will rest upon those who
attacked the Enquirer if the story shall
be continued to ics minutest detail, and it
is not impossible that the law may be yet
invoked and some of the conspirators in
this infamous job shall meet tueir deserts
behind tl.e oars."
Mr. Leach repeated to-day his assertion
that frank Mointt had been reported as
having purchased the City Committee of
the Republican party in the interest of
the new water company, and this s:ate
ment Mr. Moffitt positively denies.
Councilman Bassett, who is a close stu
dent of the local situation, said to-day
that so far as he can learn the present out
break is simply another chapter of the in
terminable quarrel between Frank Leach
and Frank Moffi.it. "It is absurd to sup
pose," sail Mr. Bassett, ''that a man as
astute as Dr. Pardee cou.d be blinded for a
whole month as to the purpose of the City
Committee in appointing that Committee
of Twenty-one, if they had a purpose.
Mr. Leach has made himself a power in
local politics, and it is very amusing to
hear him say that other people's opinions
of him are unjust and uncalled-for. There
are many dark schemes being hatched in
connection with tha coming municipal
campaign thai are still behind the scenes,
but which cannot be covered much
lonsrer."
Tne Committee of Twenty-one held an
important m-eting to-nightand took deci
sive action on the situation.
The following declaration of indepen
dence was unanimously adopted:
We, the members of the committee of twenty
one of the Republican party ot the city of Oak
land, do hereby make tne following statement
of our aims end objects, in order that tne
voters of the party muy understand the mo
tives that have prompted us in accepting this
trust:
The committee of twenty-one was appointed
by the Republican City Central Committee ot
the city of Oakland entirely at the motion of
the city committee and without request from
us or trom any one of whom we have any
knowledge. The members thereof were not
told that any sucii action was contemplated by
the City central committee and were app <inted
without their knowledge and without any
previous consultation with any one upon tlie
matter.
Thy committee has no knowledge of any
transaction aside fiom the resolution passed
by the City Central Committee creating the
committee of twenty-one aud announcing the
appointments thereof, and this committee re
pudiates and condemns in tlie strongest man
ner possible any action of the City Central
Committee as a body or as individuals, or of
any other person or persons that gives any
color to or su.sp clon of any attempt upon the
part of any corporation or any person to con
.rul or dictate in any manner the action of
ibis committee in the selection of delegates
to the convention or of tne members of the
convention so >elected.
The members of thi* committee were given
the tiower to appoint 147 good and trua Re
publicans to form a city convention of the
Republican party. No pledges of any kind
were exacted from the committee as a whole,
nor from any individuals composing the com
mittee. There was no understanding between
this commute;; as a whole, nor of tiny mem
ber thereof, with any outside parties, and wo
bad no knowledge of our proposed selection
until our names wern published by the city
central committee. We recognize the right ot
that committee to deter;: me the manner of
the formation of the Republican ci'.y conven
tion, and we accepted the trust Imposed upon
us with no other purpose than to select the
names of 147 intelligent, reliable, disinteiested
Â»nd rep esentative citizens, who uou.d con
scientiously nod imperially nominate such
men for municipal offices as they should deem
best fitted for the respective positions.
In our earnest attempt to discharge this duty
we have not In any instance sought to pro
mote the interests of any corporation or of
nny individual i>or has any man bee selected
by us a-i a delegate by rensou of his favor for
or bis opposition to Any measure or any man.
In many instances names have been rejected
by us because they seemed to be thrust upon
us by parties appearing to have personal in
terests to be served, rug we have endeavored
to select gentlemen hs delegates of whose per
sonal preferences f r possible candidates we
were ignorant. No pledges have been solic
cited or made as & condition of selection as
delegates.
This commfttee of twenty-one has sought
earnestly to secure not only honest and disin
terested delegates but men who would repre
scut the various industrial, eomme-cial and
property interests of this City, and thus secure
a truly representative representation.
This committee has no knowledge, personal
or < fflcial, of any acts of the City Central Com
mittee castlne any doubts upon the political
or personal integrity of this committee or any
of its members. Before we accepted by vote
the appointment of the Republican City Cen
tral Committee we required all candidates for
any office to resigr irom our committee and
their places were filled by nominations by our
committee. We also voted that no proxies
should be allowed In the convention, but that
all vacancies should Le filled by the respective
ward delegations.
This committee feels that should It at this
time abandon the work that it has undertaken,
and now has In haud, the result would be dis
astrous to good government in the city of
Oakland for tne ensuing two years.
This committee declares that it has been In
uo way approached with regard to its appoint
ments, and no effort has been made to influence
it, and its actions have been prompted by a de
sire for good government and the success of the
ticket to be nominated. No pieoges of any
kind have been exacted from any delegates
appointed by this commltt c. Finally, this
committee declares its belief in the following
principles:
Firstâ An honest, economical administration
of municipal affairs, so that the people of Oak
land shall be given the greatest amount of
good possible for tne taxes paid In support of
ihe city government.
Secondâ A continuance of the present water
frout litigation to the court of last appeal.
We urge that no compromise be allowed or
permitted in the water-front litigation, and
that the present suits now pending in the Su
preme Court of this State be prosecuted to
the very end, and that no dismissal or com
promise be allowed or permitted upon any
terms whatever.
Third â The securing of good roads for the
city and the improvement of the roadway of
the city in as permanent a manner as may be
posslDie.
First Wardâ D. S. Monlton, Walter Meese,
George Stanley ; Se ond Wardâ E<l Pierce, B.
D. Hunter, W. A. Rouse; Third Wardâ A. C.
Richards. E. P. Taylor; Fourth Wardâ F. D.

All the members were ready to name

two wards, and next Friday night a com
pie c list of delegates will be named.
The convention will be held next Mon
day evening.

by telephone last evening, and after satisfy

He refused to state his business or to give
his address, and when closely questioned said:
"Good-byl God bless ail my friends!" and left
the phone. Xo body was found up to a late

FITZGERALD PUT
UNDER HOT FIRE
Employment Agents Call
His New Bill a
Humbug.
They Say It Would Make Him
King of the Labor
World.
They Will Send Men to Sacramento
to Figbt Hts Propo3'd Law
to the Enl.
One of the most interesting issues that
will come to the attention of the Leeisla
ture this winter is that between State
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald and the
various employment agencies of the City.
Commissioner Fitzgerald is anxious to
have a law passed which will enable him
to establish a free labor bureau whenever
be chooses. Tnis will give him or the
Governor a tremendous appointing power,
and to this the existing employment
agencies make vigorous objection.
The next provision he seeks to have
enacted gives him the power to inspect
the books of every employment agency
and get the name and address of every
applicant. Tne men in the agency busi
ness object to this clause of the law as an
obnoxious interference with their busi
ness.
They say it may result in their business
falling under the eyes of persons hostile
to them, and that it is unfair for a State
free labor bureau, as their competitor, to
have access to all of their trade secrets.
"This man is a political mountebank,"
said H. V. Ready yesterday, * # and we
shall fight him to a finish. He was a po
litical nan er-on of his brother, afflicted
so as to be unable to earn a living until
his biotber got him this place and got
another beauty named Cleve Dam in with
him. Go to Oakland and you will find
these gentlemen's records. They have not
been and are not now the friend of labor
ers or labor unions. They are politi
cians looking for soft jobs for their
friends. Why should a Republican Legis
lature aid a schemer like Fitzgerald? We
aÂ»-e the friends of legitimate labor unions
and we pay a license to conduct a fair
business. Why should we be under sur
veillance of a man like Fitzgerald?
Never!"
Mr. Ready had on his war paint and he
hss been selected to go to Sacramento to
fight the measure by which Fiizgerald
seeks to perpetuate power and get the ad
dresses of workinsimen.
"It would give such a man as Fitzgerald
a marvelous leverage in politics," said
Ready, "to control the Labor Bureau busi
ness of the State. Wouldn't he favor men
who vote his way ? Where has the mind
of man ever conceived a more gigantic
scheme for political iraud than this? It
is simply inianious."
Mr. Ready, however, will have Leon
Dennery or Assemblyman Arnench intro
duce a bill to regulate employment aÂ«en
cies. It will require a bond of $5000 for tne
faithful discharge of business. The follow
ing is the main provision;
Every person, firm or corporation now car
rying on or conducting "the business of an
erup.oyment or intelligence office in this
State shall within sixty Jays aver this act
takes ettect, or before such persons, firm or
corporation shall thereafter commence to
conduct such business, file with the clerk of
the county, or city and county within which
such buÃiuess is or is sought to be transacted,
a bond to the people of the State of California
in t:ie penal sum of $5000, with two sureties
approved by a judge oi a Superior Court of the
county, or city and county, conditioned that,
the obligor will pay to any client or customer
of said obligor, to whom intelligence for em
ployment shall be by him or her or through
theagencyof him or her furnished and paid
for, any aud all :ees paid and necessary trav
eling expenses which said client or customer
may have incurred by reason of such intelli
fence for empio ment having been iraudu
ent.y represented by said obligor or agei.cy,
' and ai-o that execution upon any judgment
i against, said obligor for such fees or expenses
may be issued against said obligor aud said
sureties severally.
The following is the provision of Fitz
gerald's proposed bill to wnich the em
ployment agents mate vigorous objection:
Sec. 4. The Commissioner shall, es soon as
practicable after the passage of this net, estab
lish under his direction a free employment
I department of the State Labor Bureau, and to
that end he shall establish, and thereafter
I maintain, lrce employment offices, one at the
I headquarters of tue Bureau of Labor in the
i City and County of San Francisco, and in such
I other city or cities as he may, in his judgment,
deem the pub.ic interest and convenience re
quire. Ue shall designate for each of said
offices a deputy, who shall have charge of
same, togetner with such othei assistants as
may be necessary to perform the work. It
| shall be the duty of the said deputy to receive
ali applications, except those of Chinese and
! Japanese, made at the office in his ere by per
sons desiring io obtain employment, or to em
pioy labor or help of any kind ; to note requests
of all such p rsons, and record, in a book
or bioks kepi lor that imrpose, the name and
eddress and requirements of each, ana fully
impart to all applicants such information aud
advice cs he may be able to give regarding
their several wants; to exclude from the office
and enter upon a book kept lor that purpose
I the name of any person whom he shall have
! found to be unreliable, irresponsible or other
wise ot jc ttiouabie; to make monthly reports
to the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
of the number and nature of the applications
! received, the number of persons (cla>sified as
I to sex and occupation) who have secured em
plovmeut through -his office, and the number
and character of "wants." which he is unable
to supply; to collect labor statistics and facis
relating to industrial pursuits and employ
ments, and to periorm such otber duties per
taining to said 4 ftice as mny be prescribed by
the Commissioner of said bureau.
It is the general opinion of agents that
these qualifications will make ttie Labor
Commissioner, as Mr. Ready put it, "a
dangerous officer, a political dictator and
a destroyer of legiimate industry." The
views of some representative employment
agents are subjoined:
H. D. Ewerâ We are pursuing a legitimnte
business for which we pay a license of jf64 a
year. We rob nobody, but we get men and
i women situations for a small fee. Ttie Com-
I missioner, who is a political faker, seeks to get
a monopoly o: the whole business, lie wants
! the right tn appoint about 300 assistants and
to expend ab^ut Â¥100.000 a year for the State.
Is thla for the benefit of the clear workinginen
aud their unions ? No, it is for Fitzgerald and
Jim Budd, who is back of the work*. He
wants to reduce our fees an-.i inspect our
books. His bib would simply run men out of
the business. It is unjust and ought to be de
feated. Free bureaus aluavs fail, lor men who
are no.t skilled will tacklo any job free, but
they won't pay a fee unless they are skillful.
H. V. Readyâ This political understrapper is
simply seeking to pose as a king of the labor
ing world that he may control votes and posi
tions. His bill will never pass, but If it does,
we shall never close for a day, but will beat
him. The law is unconstitutional.
R. T. Wardâ The bill is an unlawful and pes
tiferous interference with a legal business.
It oufftit to be defeated. Fitzgerald or any
other Labor Commissioner would be giv<?n a
dangerous and ridiculous power for nothing.
J. F. Crosettâ Mr. Fitzgerald is an ambitious
politician. He wauU more power than the
King of the Cannibal I-lands, aud nis bill
would give it to him. \\> are in au honest

For Infants and; Children.

business and Ido not see why we should not
be tet alone.
C. F. Hansenâ l have been in this business
twenty-one years. Why should I be branded
as a rogue and driven out? Why should Fitz
gerald seek all this power ? VVe get jobs for
scores of men after his bureau lias failed, as
iree and unreliable bureaus do. He wouid bo
a little king If he could sl:p that law through
and make it stick. Why is ne not satisfied to
conduct his own bureau and let us alnne ?
We favor unions and- union men and we favor
requests iro in ministers and charitable socie
ties. We could not do business if fees were
cut down as he proposes hi addition to estab
lishing bureaus to run in opposition to us.
Fitzgerald us a bureau man is a failure. It is
a political dodge.

THE SPEEDY CONCERTINA
Sweet Music Soothes the Savage
Breast of the Messen-
ger Boy.
And Likewise Stirs Eis Sluggish
Pulse and Feet and Improves
His Digestion.
The messenger-boy "creeping like
snail" nas too long been the butt of comic
papers in need of material, but the knell
of these antediluvian witticisms has at
length been Bounded. And strange as the
statement may seem tbe source of this
knell is a concertina, if a concertina ever
forgets itself so far as to indulge in such a
thing as a knell.
This implied retorm in the manners and
customs of tbe mes=enger-boy may not be
come general lor some time to come, but
even a sincle exception to tiie reproach of
ages is a wholesome indication that the
entire breed of messenger-boys is within
the pale of ultimate salvation.
The office of the Western Union Tele
graph Company on Montgomery street is
the local habitation of this improved
breed of messenger- boys. Look here upon
this picture and on this. An ostrich to
an oyster. Tne "old style" messenger
boy, as he may be termed for the sake of
convenience, did not btlieve in violent
exercise af ler meals and as he was always
eating he usually found himself opposed
on by^ienic grounds to even the mildest
forms of physical exertion. His pace was
measured and deliberate; the ultimate
consequences of every step were carefully
weighed so to speak, and tbe placid calm
of bis ieamres was rarely disturbed by so
much as a transient emotion. How dif
ferent the "new stylo!" The weird and
startling spectacle oi messenger- boys
rustling madiy to and from the Western
Union office as though determined to
lower some sprinting record, is daily wit
nessed by a wondering world of business
men, who vuguely speculate as to its
meaning.
After all, the explanation of the phe
nomenon is extremely simple and withal
delightfully sentimental. The pcet said
of old that "Music hath charms to soothe
the savage breast," tbougu it is open to
question whether these lines have any
particular reference to messsenger-boys.
Be this as it may, some genius of the
! Western Union local management has un
j consciously profited by the poetical sug
gestion and has devised an unfailing
method of stirring tbe sluggish pulse and
feet of the company's juvenile employes.
An expert concertina player has been en
gaged to furnish choice selections
throughout the day to beguile the tedium
of the idle intervals which do occasionally
enter into the existence of a messenger
boy. This impresario has an extensive
and accommodating repertoire of popular
pieces, ranging from the Miserere in "II
Trovatore" to "The Sunshine of Paradise
Alley" and tbe latest topical at the Tivoli.
Now, therefore, when the nature of a
message calls for expeditious delivery the
gentleman in charge has no more to do
than to hand it over to the most musically
inclined member of the staff in attend
ance with the simple injunction: "Be
tbou here again ere the leviathan can
swim a league," to which the musical
messenger-boy would give assurance if he
could and supposing him familiar with
the bard: "I'll put a girdle round the
earth in forty minuter."
In fact the boys are so fearful of missing
any portion of the programme that they
j know no happiness outside the office anil
; never rest until their respective missions
are fulfilled.
No doubt tbe other City messenger oi
fices will follow the example of the West
ern Union. In the spirit of competition
I they may even go so far as to engage en
tire orchestras, with full complement of
brass, reed and string instruments. Who
can foresee the far-reaching conse
quences of this Ci mparatively simple mi
I tiative? Increase of appetite doth grow
w>th what it feeas on, and as the esthetic
appreciation of the messenger-boy de
veiopes by incessant cultivation his mer
j curial fleetness of foot may erÂ° long be
. XEvr to-da.t:

Th ;se boy 3 who are the most musical will,
i erhaps, invest their savings in bicycles
and airships in order not to lose the
sequence of a Wairnerian trilogy or the
adagio of a Beethoven s-ymphony. Simi
larly the various comoeting companies
will sjauge the taste of their emtÂ»loyes and
regulate the programme accordingly.
The superintendent may be conceived
saying to the orchestra leaders for ex
ample: "I'm sending out O'Hara. Start
up 'The Shamrock So Green' please." Or
if the Hibernian youth it of a somewhat
frivolous disposition it might be well to
substitute "Arrah, Go On !" for the more
classical melody. The system, in fact, is
capable of infinite txpansion. A decade
hence, therefore, one may expect to see in
the daily papers advertisements worded
like the following: "Wanted â Cultured
gentleman for messenger office. Must
have thorough knowledge of music and
also understand children." Truly this is
a marvelonsly progressive age.

Two favorites won at the track across
the bay yesterday, and that's pretty- good.
Several others had narrow escapes from
getting over the line in front, but that's
poor consolation for their backers. There
was the usual attendance of regulars
present and Â» goodly sprinkling of the
fair sex in the grand stand, who shivered
through six chapters of racing, lor the
weather indicated that the mercury in the
thermometers was trying to land a hard
right-hander on zero.
The betting was crisp, sparkling and
newsy. On several of the events carded
the men on the biock acted as though they
knew something, handling the coin as a
landlubber at sea would a porterhouse
steak. The gentry with the leather sacks
and a "stiade" took the train for homa
wreathed in smiles, and it is more than
likely the talent contributed again.
Seventeen tnree-year-olds tried the pa
tience of the crowd while at the post in
the opening five and a half furlong scram

but was beaten out quite easi^by Lost

Hennessy. Cappy with Sam up was a
good third.
At kin & Lottridge's Double Quick was
considered the mos-t eligible of tue fifteen
entries to the" six-lurlone run that fol
lowed, and was played down from twos to
6to 5 favoritism. Isabelle showed a high
turn of speed to the stretch, where she
collapsed, and Boreas, an 8 to 1 shot,
tnking command, proved ac easy winner
over the first choice. Abi P was tnird.
The third run, a five and a half furlong
spin, was another lengthy affair as far as
entries were concerned. Twelve galloped
over the post witn the Spreckels entry
George Palmer a 7 to 5 favorite in the bet
ting. He won by sheer gameness and not
through the good riding of H. Martin.
Taking matters altogether too easily, Mar
tin awoke from his reverie the last fur-
Jong and beat out the other Martin astride
Pat Dunne's colt Sweet William a head in
a perspiration-raising finish. It was al
t'ogetber too close for comfort and health.
Ezekiel, a 25 to 1 chance, took a shy at
tne pot and was lapped on the second
horse.
Collins, the brown gelding, furnished a
sad disappointment in the mile and a fur
long seliing event. He opened equal fa
vorite at 3 to 2 in the betting with Fortuna
and closed a slight favorite over her at the
close. Sloan had tne leg un, ana if Col
lins was possessed of any spoed refused to
disclose ft, for he carried the target from
end to end. Monita, a 60 to 1 shot, was
first into the stretch, when Fortuna passed
the outsider and in a drive passed the
stand a neck in advance of Doyle and the
outsider. The distance was covered in 1:55.
Force of circumstances compelled .Midlo
10 win the ti;th number on the pro
gramme, a scven-furiong affair decided
under selling conditions. Formal, with
Willie Martin up, was an even ;noney
choice, but the wise coin wentin on Midlo,

it Waierhouse'ii eh. ni., by
the second choice, and he led throughout,
stepping over the line a neck ahead of the
easily rid ien choice.
The final sis-furlong sprint resulted in a
handy win for the 8 to 5 favorite Rosebud,
which showed first almost throughout the
running, finally winning by a couplf of
lengths from Olive. Kowalsky was beaten
but half a length for the place.
SO I 4.
There was quite a strong play on Mis
tral 11, carrying George Rose's colors.
The colt ran flatteringly to the stretch,
where he began to wobble badly, finish
ing beyond the money.
Jack Riley, the noted tipsier, had a
dream in which he fancied Link Boy a ten
time winner. Dreams cenerally go in re
verses, and this one proved no exception.
Charley Thorpe is rapidly becoming the
most popular rider in California. Whether
he sits asiride a iongshot or a favorite the
horse receives liberal backing and gener
ally gets a piece of the money. Tbe man
ner in wliich Charley hustled along the
rank outsider Monita was invigorating in
the extreme.
Mrs. N. BiÃhop, whoever that lady may
be, possesses quite a good colt in Ezekiel,
and if the son of Emperor of Norfolk
would always pursue the money with as
much energy as he did yesterday he
would command greater respect in the
betting ring.
Mike Hennessv, who had the mount on
Ezekiel in the third event, was kicked in
the foot by Emeiia S and quite severely
injured while the field was at the post
and the entry of that filly will in future
be refused at the Oak. and track.
The track at Oakland is altogether two
hard and horsemen in generaf are com
plaining. Record smashing may serve as
a good advertising medium, but it brings
no coin into the pockets of owners witn
horses possessing unsound or "suspicious"
legs. As a result of it. Fortuna pulled up
lame and Little Cripple demonstrated by
his showing that hordes cannot run over
it two days in succession to good advan-
tage.
The Collins people had their check")
down on the gelding, but the track was
evidently too hard for his liking. â¢ He
could not untrack himself at any stage of
the journey.
Braw Scot was on his best behavior at
the post yesterday and ran a corking Rood
race. Somebody said that Barney Schrei
ber told the old gray that if be did not act
pretty in future he would send him back
to Woodland to be used as a horse of all
drudgery.
Away irom the post better Tim Murphy
would have been second and possibly bet
ter beyond a doubt. Stoney Clarke bad
new magenta colors up on the old sprinter,
but they did not seem to change his luck.
Willie Martin, the Napoleon of the sad
dle, furnished another of those rides on
| the back of Formal, odds-on choice for the
I sixth race, that so endeared him to far
j eastern racegoers and ingratiated him in
i the favor of the high turf officials in that
i part of the country. Possessed of the
patience of a professional fisherman he
waited and waited, and then waited again
with Pal Dunne's chestnut and was beaten
out a neck by M dlo. Willie is quite a
i critic himself at the slumbering rides of
other jockeys, so it is said, and it is no
more than right that the cook should eat
some of his own contriving.

TWO QUICK STUDIES.
George Osborne and Walter Belasco
Learn Their Roles as the Play of
"Chispa" Progresses.
At the Alcazar Theater last night George
Osborne performed a remarkable feat of
memory which in the last act"of "Chispa"
won him the enthusiastic applause of the
house.
Hugo Toland, who was cast for Zek*
Stevens, the heaviest role in "Chispa," is
suffering from a severe attack of laryngitis.
On Monday night he played bs part with
difficulty, btit last night, shortly before
the time for the performance to begin, he
lost his voice so comoletely that he was
unable to speak. A hasty change in tne
cast was therefore ma â '**, George Osborne
assuming the part of Zeke Stevens and
Walter Belasco taking Osborne's role of
the Indian.
Both actors conned their lines during
the moments that they were not on t c
stage, and made sucn quick study that
Belasco, who had the smaller part, kept
ahead of the performance all the time, and
it was not till the fourth act that Osborne
anpeared with his book. There was a
titter as he struggled to rea t some of tbe
melodramatic lines by the glimmer of the
footlights, whereupon Osborne stepped
forward and explained that he had been
learning his part as tbe play progressed.
Loud apdatise greeted this announce
ment, after which Osborne stepped into
the wincrs and some of the other actors
held the stage for a few minutes, while he
learned tne rest of his lines. Both Os
borne and Belasco acted their hastily
conned parts admirably.
WANTED FOR BIGAMY.
Charles I). Smith Deserted His Wife In
Portland and Married a Young
Woman Bore.
The police of this . City and Portland,
Or., are making every effort to trace the
whereabouts of Charles D. Smith, an en
gineer, who is wanted on the charge of
bigamy.
Smith left a wife and two children in
Portland on November 28 in destitute cir
cumstances and came to this City. He
was only here a lew days when a friend,'
Samuel Martin, introduced him to Julia
F. O'Kane, a saleswoman in the Empo
r urn.
Smith represented himself as an unmar
ried man and paid such marked attention
to Miss O'Kane that when he proposed
marriage to her on December 22 he was
accepted, and next day he procured a
license and they were married by Rev.
Father Hannigan of St. Mary's Cathe
dral. They went to live at thf, Lexington.
Two days later a sister of the bride met
Martin and told him that Smith had mar
ried Julia. Martin was astonished and
told her that Smith had a wife and two
children in Portland. Tne bride's mother
called upon Smith for an explanation,
and he admitted that he was a bigamist.
Smith disappeared on December 31. tak
ing $sâall5 â all the money It is wife had â and
her cold watch and chain wiih him. He
declared hi 3 intention of going to Mex'.co.
Nobility in Court.
There was a congregation of European no
bility in the United States Circuit Court yes
terday foreuoon. Lord Sholto DonglaÃ ap
peared in the role of prosecutor in an action
for libel ngainsi Thomas Flynn and the Wasp.
He objected to Dcing held up to ridicule in
Mr. Flynn's comic weekly, and ho considered
that his leeiinÃ* and family name had been
injured to the extent of $50,000. The other
represemative o.' nobility was the Baron yon
Shroedt r who appeared as the defendant ia
an infringement of patent case. Both cases
were continued.

ADVANCE IN THE
PRICE OF BEEF
The Cattle Men on All
Parts of the Coast Now
on Velvet.
EARLY SHIPMENTS EAST
Mutton Has About Doubled in
Price During the Last Six
Weeks.
BEEF WORTH 6 1-4 TO 6 1-2 NET
L. Allen, the Livestock Grower of
St. Clair, Says Early Shipments
E:st Raised the Price.
A big ri?e has recently occurred here
and all over the coast In the price of beef
and mutton. The cattle and sheep grow
ers are in consequence on veivet. They
all have cash, ana believe they will con
tinue to have it, for they say there is a
short supply and everybody who has cat
tle or sheep has something as good as
gold.
There are many cattlemen here now
from ail parts of tne country. Nearly
every Western State is represented, as
well as New Mexico, Arizona and British
Columbia. At the Russ House for a week
past there has been cattlemen from all
sections. Among the cattlemen now
there are C. B. Welshons and R. E. Keyes
of Elks; W. A. Taps-cott of Una Bluff, and
L. Allen of St. Clair, Churchill County,
Nevada.
â¢'Beef Bteer3 are now worth in Nevada
from b\ 4 to 6JjJ cents a pound net," said
Mr. Alien last night, "and beef cows from
sto sJ.j' cents. This is a good solid rise.
For the last five years the average price oi
beef steers there has been about 5 cents.
â¢'Late in December there came a rise,
and it hns been staying right with ua.
Not only have cattle come up, but sheep
have also. Mutton which six weeks ago
aeo was selling for $1 75 a head is now
bringing from $3 to $3 50 a head.
"The reason for ah this is the scarcity.
In Nevada there has been a graat thin
ning out of livestock. In began in Aug
ust ar.it September, when Eastern buyers
came in and bought up the cattie to feed.
There was an pnormous corn crop in Ne
braska, lowa, Kansas, Missouri and Il
linois, and it was to eat this corn that the
cattle were bought up.
"The Truckee Valley, which is from
â twelve to thirteen miles long, and which
usually has at this time of the year from
11,000 to 16,000 feed cattle, now hasn't
more than 3500 or 4000. This valley runs
Jroni the vicinity of Reno toward Carson,
and is in Washoe County.
"The Mason Valley has about 4000
cattle now being fattened, which is about
as many as usual. Hay has been cheap.
Alfalfa was soJd for awhiie as low as $2 a
ton.
"In the Lovelock Vnllev, or Humboldt
Sink, there are about 3000 head. Usually
at this time of the year there are from
5000 to 7000.
"Over ;n Churchill County there are
only about 1800. when there are generally
from 2500 to 3000.
"In Paradise Valley there are about
3000, and U3iu ly there are about twice as
many.
"The same thing is noticeable in Honey
Lake Valley and Sierra Valley. There
are not in both more than about 6000
2>ead, whereas there ought to be 10,003 to
12,000.
"From Humboldt east there are no
cattle at allâ that is, none worth speaking
about, and there is usually in January
from 10,000 to 20,00J head there. 1 '
Mr. Allen is lceding 340 head at his
ranch in Churchill Couaty. He says it is
the hrst time in five years that he has
had a chance to gee on the right side of
the ledger. Many people in the City have
been wondering for forae time at the
small amount of beef they have been get
ting for a good-sized amount of money.
Mr. Alien's statement may tend to some
extent to explain it.
POLICE PENSION SUIT.
Counselor Nobby Clarke Begin* An
other Action Against the Com
missioners,
Alfred "Nobby" Clarke has given an
other exemplification of his mastery of
the English language by filing a suit
which he calls "a bill in equity for re
covery of money wrongfully scooped out
of the police pension fund."
The action is m the name of Mary
Campion and is directed against the
Police Commissioners and the Board of
Supervisors m office in 1896, and com
plains that the defendants, in violation of
section 424 of the Penal Code, appropriated
for the use and benefit of J. F. Moran the
sum of $30; that said sum was a part of
the public moneys of the City and County
of San Francisco; that the payment was
contrary to Jaw; that a part of the
money was contributed by the oratrix in
this action; that in paying the same to
Moran tne defendants violated artic.le 14
of tne constitution of the United States
and section 1977 of the revised statutes
of the United SU'ten, and deprived the
"plaintiff or oratrix" of Her property
without due process of law, and denies to
her the equal protection of the law.
In view of these circumstances Mrs,
Campion demands that the court require
the defendants to refund the $30 thus
"wrongfully appropriated."
Counselor Clarke is the bete noir of the
court clerks, as he has a great many cases
filed without the payment of lees, repre
senting to the presiding Judge, as in this
case, tnat his client is not able to advance
the costs. He files a great many com
plaints, but very few ot them are pressed
to trial.
No Guilty Knowledge.
Edward Reynaud was before United States
Commissioner Heacock yesterday for
examination for passing counterfeit money.
Reynaud is a barkeeper in a saloon on Quincy
street, and he \vaÂ« accused of passing two bai
dollars upon Oscar Hawkins. The Commit
sioner dismissed the charge against the bar
keeper, holding that the man received and
paid out a lot ol money every day, Mid that it
was doubtful if he knew that the money in
question was counterfeit.
Counterfeit Coin.
Warrants were sworn out yesterday in the
United Stales District Court for the arrest of
T. J. Johnston and William 11. Ellis, who were
detected passing counterfeit nail-dollars on
Ftorekeepers in the Mission Monday night.
The men are now in the City Prison, but will
be transferred to the Federal authorities
to-day.

JEWISH LORE, A
GIFT TO BERKELEY
Valuable Library Donated
to the California
University.
Semitic Works That Belonged
to Dr. Greenebaum of
Germany.
Cornerstone of Affiliated Colleges to
Be Laid February 22â Other
News.
A valuable library gift of particular sip
nificance was made to the University of
California yesterday by Alfred Greene
baa mof this City. Through the Board of
Regents, in session for the initial meeting
of the new year, he presented the State in
stitution at Berkeley with some thousand
volumes comprising a choice collection of
Hebraic works that shall form the nucleus
of a library of Semitic languages. They
had bean the reference books of the late
Dr. Greenebaum of Germany, a prominent
rabbi, student and litterateur.
Accompanying the books was a check
for $587 50 fiom the women of tne Jewish
Temple Emanu-El of this City, with the
request that it be used in prorerly ar
ranging and labeling the new collection
and in mafcir. g certain additions to it dur
ing the present year.
The gift was rece ved with surprise and
manifest pleasure by the regents. Colonel
Fred Crocker moved that most general
and cordial thanks be returned to all those
concerned. State Superintendent of Pub
lic Instruction Black remarked upon the
thoughtfulness it indicated and the wide
spread interest that is now being shown
in the work and improvement of the
State University. Arthur Rogers charac
terized it as one of the most significant
gifts ever made the university ; it implied
great interest taken by a race remarkable
ior its shrewdness and showed that the
university is receiving the favorable and
kindly interest of the Jewish people.
As a result of this move Regent Halli
Â«tie extolied the gratuitous services of
Rabbi Voorsanger as professor of Semitic
languages at Berkeley, and the board
unanimously decided to supply an assist
ant instructor for the department as soon
as funds will permit.
Tnere are other Semitic librariesâ at
Harvard, at the University of Pennsyl
vania and elsewhere in the East â ex
piained President Kellogg after the meet
ing, but this is the lirst one either private
or public in the \\'eÂ«t. While it is not so
large it is a very valuable beginning and
will certainly be augmented.
Regent Keinstein suggested that the
cornerstone oi the new Affiliated Colleges
buildings be laid wiih proper ceremonies
on Washington's Birthday, and the idea
met with general approval.
It was decided by a close vote to pay a
superintendent of building $150 a month
rather than $'_'00, as was particularly
argued for by certain of the regents who
wish to retain for the position Robert
McKillican, ex-Sheriff of Alameda County,
who has been gratuitously serving while
expecting the appointment.
Further time was asked by and granted
to the special joint committee appointed
to devise ways and means for providing a
superintendent of construction for the
new Ailiiiaied Colleger! buildings.
The proposition of the Alameda Water
Company to supply the university at
Berkeley with waier for three years from
August, 1896, to August, 1899, at the re
duced rate ot $7 per day for 30,000 gallons
was adopted, and a contract ordered
drawn to that effect. Heretofore the uni
versity has paid $7 50 n day for the same
amount of water. The new rate provides
fur an extra charge for water in excess of
the stipulated 30.000 gallons a day.
The li nance committee recommended
the expenditure of $15,000 in effecting im
provements thought necessary in the uni
versity's Sutter-street property, now occu
pied by Nathan & Dohrmann. A new
electric elevator to replace the present
tedious means of locomotion is part of the
plan. The rinance committee reported
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1897.
( that after spending this money the prop
! erty would still be yielding net 6 per cent
lon a total investment of $400,000. The
i matter was referred to a joint committep,
â¢ composed of the finance committee and
' the building committee, with power to
act immediately.
It nas decided to postpone until the
next monthly meeting of the Board of
Regents the payment of the architect' 3
feps, pending a reapcropriation of $125.
--000 by the Legislature lor thÂ« Affiliated
Colleges.
A proposition was favorably considered
for an arrangement whereby" the library
of the* California Academy of Sciences
may be at the disposal of the Stale Uni
versity, thus giving the institution the
use ot three important libraries of refer
enceâthe State Library at Stcramento,
the University Library at Berkeley and
the on*? just mentioned.
An effort will be made through a com
mittee, with President Martin Kellogg
I as chairman, to estaolish an art loan ci-
I hibit in one of the large vacant rooms in
â  the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art.
A Joan was made by the regents from
I the university iunds of $39,000 to N. W.
j Stower. Another loan for $20,000, solicited
I by Chris Henne, a wealtuy young stu
! dent at Stanford University, was post
poned for action at the next meeting.
The letter accompanying the important
gift of Semitic works in literature is in
part as follows and explains whence came
the books and why they are given:
To the Hono<ab!e Board of Regents of the Uni
j vertity of Californiaâ Genti.f.mkn: Tlie growth
of Sfmu;c learning and ihe popularity now
I eujoyed by a study of the history, languages
: and literature of the ancient Semitic nations
have long since induced the more prominent
of American universities to institute chairs
for the competent dissemination of every
branch of knowledge embraced in these de
partments of information.
As a citizen tbe greater part of whose life
has been spent in California, I ask the pr.vi
j lege of contributing a modest and limited
'â  share- to the development of the Semitic de
partment of the Uuiyersty of California.
Having lately fallen heir to n valuable collec
tion ot Semitic works. I desire to present this
collection to the university and herewith re
spectfully ask your honorable body's accept
ance of this gift and also of the few immaterial
conditions which I Ueem it proper, in memory
of a most reverend aud learned man, to ap
pend to the same.
The collection alluded to constitutes a part
of the library of my late father, iÂ»r. Elias
Greenebaum, chief rabbi of Landau, In Ger
many, aud one of the illustrious scholars of
his time. Dr. Greenebaum, whose name is
honorably inscribed on the pages of German
niMory as ihatnf a.scholarand patriot, was a
man of progressive tendencies, who spent hU
many years and his great wealth OJ scholar
ship in the services of his people, and mate
rially aided in creating that now vast litera
ture, which, at first specifically Jewish, subse
quently branched out into the many avenues
01 Semitic scholarship. Believing that the
spirit of my late dear father approves, and
acting wholly in the liberal spirit that charac
terized his entire career through an honor
able and usefuil life of eighty years, I now
j present, ihis Semetic collection of 1000 valu
able works to the university in my father's
dear memory, and ask: First, that it be
known a.t '"The Gruenebaum Co. lection of the
Semitic Library of the University of Califor
! nisi." and that the books be labeled as such,
j and, second, that the B ard of Regents from
time to time make adequate provision for the
j maintenance of this nucleus of the gradual
I development of n. Semi tic library oi reference
i that shall be the roo>t valuable udj&act to the
1 cla.<-s of Semilic languages at d lit rnture.
Very respectiuily, Alfred Greenebaum.

quarrel, and she says her husband seized
a razor and chafed her into the street.
She returned and her husband, assisted by
his brother, forcibly ejected her from the
house, and she and hÂ«r sister were com

ITALIANS FAVOR
LITTLE CUBA
Local Leaders Are Offended
by Senator Mills'
Invective.
They Say That Signor Crispi's
Views Do Not Voice
Italy.
Officers of the Lccal Anti-Spanish
Society Get Much Aid From
Italians Here-
Senator Mills of TÂ°xas made a speech
on the Cuban question on Monday, which
was so impetuous as to include Italy in its
denunciation of the enemies of Cuba.
The local leaders of the Cuban move
ment number many Italians in their
ranks, and they are indignant over Sena
tor Mill;! 1 utterances. TII9 following ex
cerpt from the Senator's speech has par
ticularly offended the local contingent:
Are we going to be Â» cared by the tremendous
army of Italy? Signor Cnspi has declared
that Italy would regard our recognition of the
Independence ot Cuba an a very serious com
plication of foreign affairs. Who is Signor
Crispi? There was a day when the Roman
name was acknowledged throughout the
wtole earth, but. that day has passed, and tue
symbol ot power 01 Italy to-dÂ«y isamoukey
and an organ-grinder. [Laughter in the gal
leries.] Now, if Signor Crispi takes offense at
the action of Congress â if, in conjunction with
Spain, he is disposed 10 make a jioly alliance,
let, tnem come with their monkeys and organ
grinders and their hot tamales. [Laughter]
This Government is too great to sit under a
threat of all the armed powers of the earth.
F. E. Mascherini and J. H. Jones, lead
ers of the local sympathizers with Cuba,
denounce the expressions of Senator Mills,
especially in regard to tne alleged hostile
attitude of Italy.
They state that Senator Mills is wrong
as to his facts and that Italy, far from
being opposed to the liberation of Cuba, is
strongly in favor of that liberation.
"Rome itself," said Mr. Mascherini, "is
a central stronghold for Cuban relief, and
the Italian leaders in the movement
there include Felice Giufrida. Hon. Im
briani and G. Eovio, all members of tbe
Italian Parliament.
"Mr. Mills, the Senator from Texas, is
wrong in supposing that Crispi speaks for
the Italian race, and at the present time
Marquis Rudini is Prime Minli.t.T there.
As to the Senator's sarcasm regarding
Italians being only good for playing or
gans with monkeys attached, and selling
tarn ales on the corners of streets, it is well
recognized tnat the Italians are as patri
otic and have shown as much devotion to
tbe cause of freedom as tbe people of any
other nation."
Mr. Jones said: "The local Italian
colony is heart and soul with us in our
movement for Cuba's freedom and it re
sents the baseless insinuations of Mr
Mills. It is true that Mr. Mills believed
that be was doing the best tor Cuba, but
his efforts will be thrown away if he in
cludes in his campaign such attacks upon
a friendly and sympathetic people. It
might be well before he makes a sueech of
such imponance, and which will be spread
all over the world, that lie should <it least
ascertain the name of Italy's .Premier, and
avoid & gratuitous insult to a peeple that
love independence as well as the Italians
have proved they do."
L'ltalia of this City has taken up the
cudgel acainst Senator Mills, saying:
"Italy was yesterday heavily offended by
Senator M ils." It takes the position that
Crispi does not stand for liuly aud that
Italy is not against Cuba.
