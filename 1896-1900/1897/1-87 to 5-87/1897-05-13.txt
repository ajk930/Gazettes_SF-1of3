HER TEETH TO
THE CONCERT.
No Answer Returned to the
Embassadors' Demand
for an Armistice.
VICTORY EMBOLDENS THE PORTE
Belief That the Real Trouble in the Balkans
Has but Commenced â Edhem Pasha's
Army Continues Its
Advance.
rcopyrlÂ£fit, 1897, by the New York Bnn ]
LONDON, ENG., May 12. â The question which is really the key to
and gist of the whole Eastern situation was raised to-day at Constanti
nople when the Embassadors submitted to the Sultan a peremptory de
mand that he direct a cessation of hostilities in order that peace
negotiations could be undertaken. There is grave fear in diplomatic
circles that the Sultan will prove stiff-necked and resist all serious
attempts at European control. The belief is growing that the effect
of the easy Turkish victories will be to increase the difficulties of the
whole Eastern problem.
Pessimistic reports from Constantinople and Paris assert that the
hope of reducing the Porte to even the partial pliability which it dis
played before the war is almost gone. It is believed the scheme of
reforms for the Ottoman empire which was agreed to in December
must be wholly abandoned. The agreement between Russia and Aus
tria does not much improve the situation, because the attitude of France
is becoming more philo-Greek in sympathy with England.
The Sultan's reply to the demand of the powers for an armistice
had not been received at a late hour to-night. Dispatches from Athens
show that the feeling there wavers between uneasiness because of the
delay in receiving the reply and optimism based upon the hitherto
peaceful attitude of the Ottoman troops, which suggests that Edhem
Pasha has already been instructed to hold them in hand.
The Constantinople correspondent of the Standard, adhering to the
pessimistic view, declares that the proposal for an armistice was far
from palatable to the Turks, who fear that they will be deprived of the
fruits of their victory. He adds that in view of the excited state of
public feeling it is to be hoped that the powers are prepared for the
possibility of having to enforce their demands. Hitherto Russia alone
has been in a position to act promptly. It is no secret that she had
ioo.ooo troops armed and equipped on the shores of the Black Sea and
transports ready to land them anywhere within thirty-six hours. At
the same time Russia does not pretend to conceal her anger with
Greece or her intention to refrain from compelling the Turks to evacu
ate Thessaly.
The Telegraph's Constantinople correspondent says the attitude of
the Sultan shows resentment against the powers for intervening, and
unless he is allowed to treat with Greece direct he is likely to be
exacting in his demands.
WAR MAY EE PROLONGED.
Greece Will Not Accept the Terms
of Peace Imposed by
Turkey.
LONDON, Exg., May 12.â The Athene
correspondent of the Times says that be- !
cause of the delay in arranging an armis
tice the Greek Government to-day ad
dressed strong representations to the dip
lomats, repudiating responsibility in the
event of further bloodshed which might
be attended by serious complications.
Prime Minister Ralli informed the cor
respondent that the Government was in
a serious predicament, having made large
sacrifices, especially in accepting auto
nomy for Crete, which neither Great
Britain nor Russia demanded. It hnd
thus compromised itself in the eyes of
both Greeks and Cretans without obtain
ing a positive guarantee that Turkey
would consent to an armistice. Should
the war be continued the position of the
Government would be most unenviable.
Meanwhile the continued absence of tele
grams from General Smolenski canses
much anxiety.
A dispatch to the Chronicle from Ath
ens, sent late to-night, says the Govern
ment has reason to be dissatisfied with
the information it receives to-night re
specting the tendency of the situation in
diplomatic quarters, and that there is a
growing opinion that it would be better
to continue the struagle than to submit to
terms wounding the national honor.
Borne of the powers are inclined to favor
tbe payment of a small indemnity, a rec
tification of the frontier in favor of Tur
key and a limitation of the Greek flee .
Greece, the correspondent declares, would
never accept this. He remarks that the
wording of the joint note reserves to
Greece the rignt to reject the terms the
powers shall decide upon, and says the
Government insisted upon the employ
ment of the word "intrust" instead of
"abandon" in reference to handing its in
terests to the powers.

CANEA, Crete, May 12.â The iteamer
Theseus went to Platania to-day, escorted
by the Italian warship Etna, to embark
Greek troops under the agreement of the
Greek Government to withdraw its forces
from the island. Colonel Staikos, the
Greek commander, was notified that the
vessel was ready to immediately take the
men aboard. Staikos, who had heard
nothing aoout the withdrawal of troops,
was taken completely dv surprise. He
stated that cloudy weather had prevented
the use of the heliograph, and therefore it
had been impossible lor the Greek Gov
ernment to communicate with him. He
declined to order his troops to embark
until he received definite instructions.
EDHEM PASHA ADVANCES.

LONDON. Em., May 12.- Early dis
patches from correspondents with the
Turkish army in Thes-aly say Eahem
Pasha has established headquarters upon
the hill opposite Pharsala, and an Impor

to cease hostilities have been received by
the Turkish commander-in-chief, and it
is b lieved that Edhem Pasha deslreÃ to
giyo the Greeks their coup de grace before
such instructions arrive.
Later advices say the Turks continue to

BOLD GtHNAN SOCIALISTS.
Denounce in the Reichstag the Penal
â  Code Clause Raiding (9 the Crime
- of Lose Majeste. â¢
BERLIN, Germany, May 12.â
Reichstag to-day debated the motion oi
HerrÃebel (Socialist) for the repeal of
the clause in the penal code bearing upon
the crime of lese majeste.
At the outset of the debate Singer
(Socialist) arose and warned the public in
the galleries that several detectives were
there and that visitors had better refrain
from giving utterances to their opinions.
Bebel dwelt upon the enormous increase
in the number of trials tor lese majeste
and the widening of scope of the offense.
He instanced the case of a man who was
tried and punished for making disrespect
ful remarks about the Emperor in bis
own bouse in the presence of only merfa
bers of hid family. Bebel denounced the
courts for completely altering the con
ception of lese majeste, for inventing the
crime of indirect lese majeste and' for
condemning accused persons who had
net named the Emperor, but were simply
supposed to have aimed their remarks
at him.
The president of the Reichstag warned
Bebel that he must not drag the name of
the sovereign into debate.
Dr. Lieber, leader of the Centrists, and
Richter, Radical leader, agreed that reform
was required. Richter proposed that the
matter be referred to a committee.
Liebknecht (Socialist) supported this
proposal. In the course of his remarirs
he relerred to the Emperor and was called
to order by the president. He protested
against this, dec'.aring that despite tho
fact that a latent crisis existed the
Reichstag was torbidden to disenss the
-abject. In conclusion he said that the
Germans were becoming the laughing
siock of the world.
A vote was then taken on the Babel
motion, and it was rejected.
KRUGER BEARDS THE LION.
Boldly Insists on the Right of His Gov

CAPE TOWN, South Afbica, May 12.â
President Kruger of the Transvaal has
replied to Colonial Secretary Chamber
lain's dispatch protesting against the
Transvaal alien immigration law as a vio
lation of the terms of the London conven
tion, 1884. In reply the Boer President
insists upon the right of *.he Transvaal
Government to pass a restrictive immigra
tion law, and adds that the Government
also insists npon itg right to submit to
arbitration the question of indemnity for
the Jameson raid and other points in con
troversy.
Owing to the belief that Chamberlain's
protest was practically an ultimatum,
Kruger's reply ievives the apprehension
tbat war may yet. result from tne quarrel.

FORSYTH TO BE
MAJOR-GENERAL
His Nomination Sent to
the Senate by the
President.
initial Move in a Plan for
the Elevation of Three
Brigadiers.
Bliss to Follow, and Both to Retire
After Confirmation In Favor
of Brooke.
WASHINGTON, D. O, May 12.â The
nomination of Brigadier- General James
W. Forsyth to be major-general was sent
to the Senate to-day. This is the initial
move in the plan that will give President
McKinley the appointment of two more
major-Â«enerals and three brigadier-gen
erals. Forsyth was nominated with the
understanding that immediately upon his
confirmation he would go on the retired
list voluntarily, to make way for another
brigadier-general and perhaps two. This
plan has been perfected, and the proba
bilities are that when Forsyth retires
Brigadier-Genera! Z. R. Bliss will be nomi
nated to succeed him under the same
conditions.
It is certain, howerer, that Brigadier-
General John R. Brooke will secure pro
motion whether General Bliss be nomi
nated or not. He has been given a prom
ise to tbat effect, and Bliss will not be
made a major-general except upon the
stipulation that he also retire to make
way for Brooke.
Brooke is senior brigadier-general, while
Generals Forsyth and Bliss stand third
and fourth, respectively. In addition to
the honor of ranking as major-general the
pay of that grade on the retired list is
$1500 more than the retired pay of a
brigadier-general and the promotion is
valued accordingly. Forsyth commands
the Department of California, Brooke the
Department of Missouri and Bliss tÂ£e De
partment of Texas.

diately after, his confirmation as major
general will probably make General
Shatter commander of the Department of
California.
Colonel William Graham of the Fifth
Artillery, formerly in command of the
Presidio, called on Representative Lond
to-day. He is earnestly pressing his '
claim for appointment as brigadier
general. It is not believed that Colonel
Qraham had anything to do vriih the de
termination of Secretary Alger not to de
tail Major John A. Darling as military at
tache at Brussels. Tuis impression was
doubtless created by a recollection of the
contest for social supremacy at the Pre
sidio between the wives of Colonel Graham
and Major Darling. I
The record of Major-General James W.
Foray th for brilliant and active service in
the field is not surpassed in modern mili
tary annals. lie was appointed in 1851 to
the military academy from Ohio â the
State in which he was born in August,
1834â and graduated July 1, 1856. He
served on the Pacific Coast before the war,
being stationed under Captain Piukett at
San Juan Island, in Paget Sound, in the
fall of 1859.
During the war he participated In so
many battles, skirmishes and raids that it
is difficult to indicate where his most
brilliant achievements were performed.
He fought in that desperate straggle at
Chickamauga, and with General Sheridan
scaled the heights of Missionary Ridge,
where the center of the Confederate army
was broken. He fought in the peninsular
campaign on General George B. Mc-
Clellan's staff. He was General Sheridan's
chief of staff in the famous campaign in
the Shenandoah Valley, and rode with
Sheridan on the raids of the campaign
which closed at Appomattox.
Among the battles in which General
Forsyth participated may do mentioned
Games Mill, White Oak Swamp, Malvern
Hill, bouth Mountain, Hoovers Gap,
Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, the
Wilderness, Spottsylvania, Cold Harbor,
Cedar Creek, Five Forks, Sailors Creek,
Fishers Hill, Petersburg, Winchester and
Appomattox.
General Forsyth was breveted for gal
lant and meritorious conduct at Chicka
mauga, Cedar Creek and Five Forks,
while the brevet of brigadier-general was
bestowed for "gallant and meritorious
services during the war."
At Appomattox Courthouse, where Gen
eral Lee's army was brought to a stand
still by Sheridan's cavalry and held until
the infantry arrived, Forsyth was the
bearer of preliminary messages leading to
the surrender, he rode for a long dis

TYPHOON II WINS
FROM ORNAMENT
Classic Kentucky Derby
Run Over a Slow
Track.
The Race a Procession, With
the Winner Always In
Front.
Shows an Abundance of Reserve
Speed When Challenged by
the Favorite.
LOUISVILLE, Kt., May 12.â 1n the bet
ting there were six horses in the twenty
third renewal of the classic Kentucky
Derby, but when it came to the running
there were only two, the beautiful pair of
chestnuts, Typhoon II and Ornament.
For a mile around the oval the race was a
procession, with Typhoon II leading, and
only in the stretch did 15,000 enthusiastic
Kentuckians see a horse race.
After hanging on grimly all around the
track, from a length to three lengths be
hind Typhoon, Clayton began driving
Ornament vigorously at the turn into the
stretch and cut down the gap to a lengtn.
At the sixteenth pole after a burst of speed
Ornament lapped the leader and for a
brief moment his bead showed in front,
but Garner called on game Typhoon and
the colt answered as if he had unlimited
speed and endurance to meet the demand.
He shot ahead, speeding under the wire a
winner by three-quarters o* a length in
the slow time of 2:l2}^, the track being
heavy.
Not in years has the Derby been awaited
with the degree of interest that this after
noon's contest aronsed, and the wiseacres
judged it in advance as a wide-open race.
Men with money to wager were of many
minds, and the winter book took in
money in all manner of sums on the six
colts that faced the starter to-day. The
ring couldn't handle the money offered.
The crowd was frenzied and pushed and
jostled and swore in the struggle to reach
the stands where the best odds were
offered.
Ornament opened a 6 to 5 favorite, with
Typhoon II at 2 to 1; Dr. Catlett sold at 9
to 2, Dr. Sbepard at 15 to 1, and Ben
Brown and Goshen each at 10 to 1. Orna
ment's odds receded to even money under
a heavy play, but at post he went back to
6 to 5, Typhoon going to 11 to 5.

STILL WiYLER CONTINUES TO
"PACIFY."
Enormous Losses to Capital and
Commerce of This Counry
Set Forth.
HAVANA, Cuba, May 12.- -American
intervention is tne general desire to-day,
even of those who a iew months ago were
among the most uncompromising Span
iards. To such an extent has this feeing
developed that many important business
men here, Spaniards and Cubans alike,
have informed their correspondents in the
United States of the terrible situation on
the island and the general paralysis of
business consequent upon the war. They
have pointed out also the heavy loss of
American capital and the great cinmiige to
American commerce inflicted by the con
tinuation of hostilities. More tban $100,
--000,000 has been lost by American mer
chant!, manufacturers, producers and
money-lenders in Cuba, and the embargo
upon mercantile operations since 1895
rei>resentsa much lar_er sum.
There is the best authority for saying
that as a result of these representations a
number of important "banners and mer
chants of New YorH who have business
relations with Cuba have presented a pe
tition to the American Government, re
ferring to the state of affairs in Cuba and
the desirability of the United States doing
something to stop the dire distress of this
country, particularly in view of the de
struction it is working to American inter
ests. The petition has tho signatures of
August Belmont & Co., Lawrence Tur
nure & Co., J. B. Ward <fe Co. and other
prominent houses of New York.
This has been precipitated by the issue
of $30 : 0C0,000 in paper by the Govern
ment and forcing it upon the people by
Weyler as a legal-tender means to ruin
every one who has property or business
here. Before Monday's run on the Span
ish bank the newspapers here began to
advise the Government of the evil, but
the only remedy, gold redemption, is not
within tne powÂ«r of the Government to
apply. General Weyler's only answer is
paper money, wrongly and criminally
depreciated, its value being fully guaran
teed.
Eight thousand persons are now sick
from smallpox, and more than 4000 sol*
diers are dying from yellow fever in the
hospitals, which are overcrowded. To
show how terrible is the situation from a
sanitary point of view, it is enough to say
that the rate of mortality this year is esti
mated at 40 per cent of the total popula
tion.
SWEEPING CUBAN VICTORY.
Spanish Forces March lato a Trap Laid
for the Insurgents and Are Nearly
Annihilated.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 13.â The Her
alj's Havana special says: Apparently re
liable news of the m-ost important insur
gent success in months has just reached
Havana. It appears that General Calixto
Garcia and General Rabi fell on a Spanish
force carrying food and supplies from
Manzanillo to Bayamo early last week,
captured the convoy, routed General
Lono's column and pursued him so vigor
ously that be fled to the coast with the
remnant of his brigade and took a ship at-
Cabo Coruz for Manzaniilo.
It is said that so severe ware his losses
and so thoroughly disorganized were bis
men that the Spanish general did not dare
to attempt to retrace his steps to Manza
niilo by land, fearing that he would be
again attacked and this time wiped out of
existence.
This engagement, which is regarded as
more important than any battie since
that of Cacarijicara, goes to show how
belpiess the Spanish are in the country
east of the trocha. What is known of the
affair came in a private letter to a Spanish
officer Here.
General Lono laid a trap for the insur
gents. Believtiig the convoy would be
attacked he sent a mule train ahead with
a scant escort, intending to flank the
rebels while the escort held their fire.
His force is said to have been between
1500 and 2000 men.
Garcia, with between 6UO and 1000 men,
waited for the convoy three leagues from
Bayamo. He was told by his scouts that
there was a large Spanish force following
the poorly protected mule train, and sus
pecting a trick be allowed the pack mules
and small escort to pass without molesta
tion, and placed his men in an advan
tageous position to await the coming of
Lono.
The Spanish eagerly awaiting the sound
of firing ahead which wouid tell tiiera the
train bad been attacked, marched straight
into the trap. Dismayed by the sharp
musketry fire from ambush, ttio SDaniards
fled utterly demoralized, when the Cubans
charged them with machetes.
Jiti IMPVHTA .n J ' CONFEttKXCE,
Cuban Solicit of the Administration Will
boon Be iJrflned.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 12.â The
President, Secretary Sherman and the
members of the Foreign Relations Com2
mittee of the Senate were in conference
this afternoon and to-night on the Cuban
question. The administration is prepar
ing to outline its Cuban policy and as a
preliminary step the President is anxious
to secure the utmost harmony of action
between the State Department and Con
gress and also to have the public fully
understand the facts upon which he will
base that policy.
The debate in the Senate during the
present week on Morgan's joint resolu
tion providing for the recognition of bel
ligerency and maintenance of neutrality
has not been entirely satisfactory either
to the frituds or opponents of the resolu
tion, mainly because of the reported
charge that the State Department has not
fully advised the Senate of the nature of
all reports oa file in the State Department
from representatives oi the United
States in Spain and Cuba.
It is maintained by the opponents of
the resolution that the State Department
is doing everything possible to meet the
expressed views of Congress, but they are
not able to deny t'ne charges brought
by Morgan, Allen and others that confi
dential communications received from
Consul-General Lee and other agents of
the United State-, of utmost importance,
have been withheld even from members
of the Foieign Relations Committee.
It is now proposed to meet this charge
by sending to the Foreign Affairs Com
mittee, in confidence, every scrap of in
formation in the files of the State Depart
ment in relation to the Cuban question.
Then, as a second step in the policy, the
Morgan resolution â which by general con
sent went over to-day pending conference
"between the President and Senatorsâ is to
be referred to the Committee on Foreign
Relations, who will thereupon decide
what part of the information to make pub
lic. The President told the Senators to
day that the Senate should immediately
be put in possession of every report re
ceived by the State Department.
For several days past the State Depart
ment officials, under the direction of
Judge Day, First Assistant Secietary, have
been preparing this information for trans
mission to the Senate committee, and to
night it was laid before the members of
the sub-committee, who to-day talked
with the President. Tflis committee met
nt the residence of Secretary Sherman,
and it is thought that as a result of their
conference the bulk of the State Depart
ment reports will be made public, perhaps
to-morrow. Although no definite state
ment has been made by any responsible
official of the administration it is gener
ally believed that the President will not
proclaim his Cuban policy until Special
Commissioner Calhonn returns.
One important reason for the present
activity of the administration and the
Committee on Foreign Relations in their
attempt to map out a harmonious Cuban
policy is their desire to counteract the ef
fect of Foraker's speech in the Senate yes
terday, it is learned from those who
talked with the President to-day that he
was very much surprised at what the Sen
ator had to say about the attitude of the
administration on the Cuban question end
was inclined to be annoyed at some of
Foraker's statements, chiefly because they
might be accepted as being inspired by
the President himself.
Sherman is understood to be particu
larly annoyed at Foraker's statement tbat
the President has sent a duly authorized
agent to Cuba. The administration has
been very desirous of creating the impres
sion tnat Caihouu's mission was simply to
investigate the murder of Dr. Piiiiz and
the circumstances attending his trial.
With this understanding the Commis
sioner goes to Cuba with tbe sanction of
the Spanish Government; but of course
Calhoun will investigate all the phases of
the Cuban question, and it is fair to pre
sume that tue President will be cuided
largely in his course toward Cuba by the
facts and recommendations of Calhoun's
report. #
r'orafcer has been a member of the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations since Satur
day las;, and is, therefore, regarded as ex
cusable ;or speaking with a candor not
generally exhibited by a Senator of longer
service upon a committee dealing with im
portant questions of diplomacy. His
statement, however, is generally accepted
as a semi-official announcement that no
action on the Cuban question will be taken
by the administration uutil Calhoun re
turns.
In tbe meantime there is reason to be
lieve that the administration and Senate
will act with such entire accord that the
public will be placed in possession of all in
lonnation on the CuDac question proper to
be made public, and that its publication
will be followed by the prompt passage of
the Morgan resolution. It is probable,
moreover, that influences will be brought
to bear in the House insuring the passage
of the resolution by that body so that it
can be signed by the President during the
present session.
SOMEWHAT PARADOXICAL
A New Hampshire Man Who Couid Not
Marry H s Mother- in- Law, but
He Did It.
BOSTON, Mass.. May 12.â A man can
not marry his mother-in-law in New
Hampshire. G. F. Wright, a harness
maker of Fitchburg, has had a matrimo
nial experience which is somewhat pecu
liar. Several years ago he was married to
Miss Towne o' New Ipswich, N. H. Soon
afterward they had domestic troubles,
which resulted in Wright securing a di
vorce. Shortly afterward he married his
former wife's mother, Mrs. Lizzie Towne.
Wright and his mother-in-law soon after
ward moved to Fitchburg and for four
years lived together as man and wife. In
November, 1884, they separated, and
Wright discovered that according to the
laws of New Hampshire he had never
been legally married to Mrs. Towne. He
accordingly petitioned a court of this
.Stale to annul his marriage. The case
was heard at the Worcester County
session of the Superior Court in Worcester
to-day, and Judge F. G. Fessinden an
nulled Wright's matrimonial relations
with his mother-in-law.
CROSSED THE DEAD LIKE.
Sheepmen Ignore 6 Notice From Settlers
on Kirby Creek, Wye, and Pay
the Ftnaity.
JASPAR, Wyo., May 12.â Some time
this spring settlers in that part of the
country around the head of Kirby Creek,
about forty miles north and west of Lost
Cabin, established a dead line and sent
out notices that no sheep could be run
into the Kirby Creek country. Woodruff
Bros., a rich company, have pastured
sheep there for the past eight years and
started in again this spring. Last Satur
day sixteen men visited one of their
camps, took the herder into custody and
Urove the ewe herd across the mountains,
leaving the lambs behind. This means a

COLLAPSE OF THE
HONDURAS REVOLT
Weakness of Those in
Command Led to
Defeat.
Rebels Lost Puerto Cortez
Through a Traitor in
Camp.
The Revolutionary General Cap
tured and Taken on Board
the Warship.
NEW ORLEANS, La., May 12.âPas
sengers on the steamer Clearwater, from
Honduras, report that the revolution
started several weeks ago, fo. lowed by the
capture of Puerto Cortez by a party under
General J. Drammond, had collapsed
owing to the failure oi weakness of some
of those in command. General Drum
mond made a gallant fight. He carried
Puerto Cortez by .storm, and held the port
from April 15 until last Saturday. An
army of 500 Government troops sent
against him met speedy defeat, when the
Government called for aid from Nica
ragua, which came in the shape of a war
ship, armed with two guns, and a force
under command of General Reyes.
The warship Lucy B. reached Puerto
Cortez last Thursday and gave notice
under a flag of truce for women and chil
dren to leave, as it intended to bombard
the city.
On Friday during an engagement with
it, when the revolutionists intended to
use a Krupp gun they found that some
traitor had removed part of the breech,
rendering the gun useless. When they
attempted to use an old cannon captured
from the Honduras troops there was a
premature discharge and Drummond was
slightly injured. These incidents, to
gether with reports from the interior that
their friends had deserted them, caused
the revolutionists in Puerto Cortez to lay
down their arms and flee to Guatemala,
and when Honduras troops arrived dur
ing the evening and joined the Nicara
guans in the assault upon Puerto Cortez
they found none to resist them.
Drummond was made a prisoner and
taken on board the warship juÂ«t as the
Clearwater left Puerto Cortez on Satur
day. It was learned that no harsh meas
ures would probably be dealt out to him
beyond banishment. The general-in
chief of the inland revolutionists, General
Antonio Lopez, on account of desertions
iound his force too small to proceed to the
coast.
The officers of the Clearwater state that
they found the Honduras Government in
charge of Puerto Conez and the port
open for business. No warships, either
American or English, had arrived when
the Clearwatsr lelt.
FORSYTHE TO BE
MAJOR-GENERAL
Continued from Firtt Page.
tance through the Confederate lines, ac
companied by an officer of General Long
street's staff. The object of the ride was
to reach by the direct road General Grant,
who was supposed to be with General
Meade. On that ride he met several Con
federate officers with whom he had served
in the old army before the war.
By authority of the War Department in
1870 he accompanied Sheridan to Europe
on leave of absence, and by permission of
the King of Prussia was at that monarch's
headquarters until Paris was invested. In
fact, he was assigned to Bismarck's house
hold, and was permitted to view the bat
tles of Gravelotte, Beaumont and Sedan.
He was at Bordeaux when the Thiers
treaty was Bitrned. He was in Paris dur
ing the reign of the commune, and under
his windows the killing in the streets of
Paris began.
The promotion of General Forsyth to
the grade of major-general is regarded by
both army officers and civilians as an act
of just recognition. He made no effort to
secure this recoznition until the precedent
established by President Cleveland in the
appointment at McCook had been followed
by President McKinley in the appoint
ment of Wheaton. Then his claims were
per3ented to tha administration by influ
ential friends.
T.be new major-general received many
congratulations at army headquarters at
the Pacific- Union Club yesterday.
CHAPMAN'S CASE IN THE SENATE.
Hoar Agrees With A<ien That the Contu
macious Witness Should Bo
Punished.
WASHINGTON, D. C May 12.-The
Senate to-day passed bills for public build
ings at Deadwood, S. D., $200,000, and at
Indianapolis, $1,500,000; also a bill grant
ing 560,000 acres of land to Montana for an
asylum for the blind, and a bill to pay
Charles P. Chouteau of St. Louis $174,000
for extra work on the ironclad Etlah.
A resolution by Butler (Pop.) of North
Carolina instructing the PostofÃce Com
mittee to inquire into the postal savings
bank system of other countries was
agreed to.
A resolution was offered by Butler, but
went over till to-morrow, requesting the
President to inform the Senate under what
authority the proposed sale of the Union
Pacific Railroad had been agreed to be
tween the executive and any combination
of purchasers.
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska offered a reso
lution with a long preamble in reference
to the case of Elverton Chapman of New
York, who wa3 tried and convicted of
misdemeanor in refusing to answer ques
tions of the Senate committee in the
sugar-trust investigation and who was
now seeking executive clemency. The
resolution declare-* it to be the sense of
the Senate that as a condition of such
clemency Chapman should be required to
appear before the Senate and purze him
self of contempt by answering the ques
tions which he had declined to answer
and by making such disclosures as he bad
been then requested to make.
"Let the resolution go over," said Gal
linger. "My judgment is that it should
be printed and that we should have an
opportunity to look at it. On former oc
casions the Senate has callna upon per
sons to testily who were not engaged in
corrupt transactions and Ido not desire
to bo again subjected to such an annoy
ance."
Allen explained that the resolution did
not contemplate any further inquiry and
he expressed the hope that Gaihnger
would not insist upon a technicality.
Hoar expressed the hope that Allen
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAIX, THURSDAY, MAT 13, 181*7.
would allow the resolution to be referred
to the Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions. He was as much in favor as Allen
could be that the sugar investigation as
well as another investization of the sale
of bonds should proceed to the uttermost
and that it should "touch bottom" before
it stopped. He had no sympathy with
anybody who would "whistle either of
thosa two inquiries down with wind."
He Hgreed with any Senator who desired
to assert the dignity and authority of the
Senate in such matters. Chapman, he
said, was liable to be punished criminally,
as he had been sentenced, and he ought
to be punished criminally. He did not
think, however, that a pardon would
relieve him of the penalty for his con
tempt of the Senate. The Senate was
authorized and ought to bring Chapman
before us bar and propound to him again
the questions which he had refused to
answer and if be uid not now answer
them commit him for contempt whether
the President pardoned him or not.
But ne did not think it becoming for
the Senate to express an opinion as to
condition^ on which the President should
pardon him.
Allen said he looked upon Chapman
more as a viciim than a criminal.
After further discussion Galhnger in
sisted on his objection and the resolution
went over till to-morrow.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 12.-Bioker
Eiverton Chapman said to-day that JUe
had received notice from his attorney
that he must be in Washington on Mon
day morning and that he would go there
Sunday prepared to enter upon a term of

MORE CHINESE ADMITTED.
Secretary Gage Sc.ys Ths Will Bb 'he End
of Concessions to the Nashville
Expcs/f/on.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 12. -Secre
tary Gage put his foot down hard to-day
on the importation of Chinese laborers
for the Nasnville exhibition, under xhe
very broad provisions of the joint resolu
tion of Congress concerning the empioy
mcnt of aliens there. Gage had admitted
two parties of Chinese which arrived with
written concessions from the exhibition
company. Yesterday the Collector of
Customs of San Francisco reported that
257 more Chinese had arrived with an
other concession.
The Secretary had pieviously decided
he would admit not more than 250 Chi
nese, so be directed the Collector to let in
twenty-one of the new arrivals, thus till
ing the limit. But this morning the
director-general of the exposition tele
graphed an urgent request that the San
Francisco party be given entrance as it
had come under proper authority from
the exhibition company. The treasury
officials re-examined the joint resolution
and came to the conclusion that Secretary
Gage had no right to k<>ep out any con
tingent with a formal concession, even if
it numbered a million Chinese. The Sec
retary could do nothing except grant per
mi&sion to land, and he also sent direc
tions to the Collector at Tacoma to admit
sixty-four more Chinese who want to go
to Nashville, making a total of 321 allowed
to enter the United States to-day.
Then the Secretary proceeded "to tell the
exhibition company that other conces
sions were null and void, a-nd that the ex
hibition would have to get along with the
550 Chinese already permitted to enter
this country. The director-general tele
graphed that no more concessions had
been granted.

GUNBOAT GOING TO ALASKA.
Secretary Long Responds io the Call for
Protection of Americans in
tho Territory.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 12.â Ex-
Senator Blair of New Hampshire, John J.
Brady, United States Commissioner for
Alaska, and Lewis L. Williams, United
States Marshal of Alaska, had a confer
ence to-day with Secretaries Alger and
Lcng about foreign interference with che
rights of American citizens in the Terri
tory. This subject was discussed by tha
Cabinet yesterday, and Secretary Long
announced his intention to send a gun
boat under construction in San Francisco
to Alaskan waters as soon as it was
finished.
Representations were made to Secre
taries Alger and Long at to-day's confer
ence tha: the interests of Americans in
the Yukon miuing country were being
encroaci.ed upon by alien adventurers,
many of them desperate charac
ters, and that military assistance was
needed 10 help Marshal William* to en
force the law. It was agreed that Juneau,
where supplies for miners are put ashore,
would be the best place to send tbe gun
boat.
Alger said he wanted to establish a mili
tary post at Junean, and Secretary Long
added that if this could not ne accom
plished before the gunboat sailed he
would send a force of marines.

Invitation* -From All Quarter* Touring
Into thf Uhlle Home.
WASHINGTON, D. C.. May 12.â The
President is being flooded with invitations
to visit different parts of the country, but
it is unlikely that he will accept more
than one or two of them. The Utah dele
gation agam visited the White House to
day and urged the President to accept
their invitation to be present at Bait Lake
during the third week of July. St. Louis
people are still after , him to deliver the
Decoration day oration at St. Louis, and
New Yorkers have asked him to vist West
Point and New York City on May 31.
It is improbable that he will accept any
of these Decoration day invitations. He
will visit Philadelphia on Saturday to
witness the unveiling of the Washington
monument, and he has promised the
Nashville Centennial people to attend
their exposition in the early part of June,
but these are the only two positive I en
gagements he has - made. Should Con
gress adjourn by July 10 the President
will probably make . the Utah trip, and
probably he will visit several nearby cities
en route.
VASAL TOR TWO CITIES.
Secretary Alger Ha* Power to Permit
â¢ Its dm it r ruction,
WASHINGTON. D. C, May 12.â
Secretary of War recently asked the
Attorney-General to give '; an . opinion
whether the War Department had author
ity to permit the construction of a canal
or channel from Sabine Puss to Port
Arthur,. Tex. -> A private company having
large interests at Port Arthur wants to
connect the pass with the lake on which
! Port Arthur is situated, a distance of
eight miles, to give an outlet to the Gulf
of Mexico. They represented to the Sec
retary that their property would be very
greatly enhanced in value if they were
allowed to construct a sip canal, but op
position came from a rival corporation.
Secretary Alger was in doubt as to his
right to grant the authority and referred
the matter to McKenna, who rendered an
opinion to-day. He holds that the Secre
tary of War has authority to grant the
permit. â¢

NANIWA DID HOT
SALUTE THE FLAG
Grave Oversight by the
Japanese Cruiser at
Honolulu.
Philadelphia Marine Arrested
for Clubbing Another
in Parade.
The Shore Drill Caused Much Erro
neous Excitement Among
the Japanese.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, May s.â Admiral
Beardslee and his personal staff â Lieuten
ant G. M. Stoney and Ensign Willardâ
have booked their passage to the United
States on the Bteamship Australia leaving
here on June 2.
The combined battalions of the Phila
delphia and Marion, headed by the band
of the former, where given shore drill yes
terday morning, parading the principal
streets in going and coming from the base
ball grounds, where the drill was held.
During the drill one member of the
Philadelphia's crew stepped on another's
toe and in return was clubbed on the head
by the latter with the butt end of his rifle.
The assailant was promptly put under ar
rest for court-martial, the wounded man
being temporarily bandaged up and sent
to the ship by a detail of the hospital
corps.
There was much excitement during the
march of the United States marines and
sailors among the Japanese, who Have
not yet done talking about it. They con
sider the landing of the troops as a
menace against the Japanese, and are ap
parently borrowing much trouble
about it.
Tne Japanese cruiser Naniwa came into
port this morning. At the Japanese lega
tion she was not expected until to-mor
row. The Japanese in the city were lig
uring on getting up a demonstration on
the arrival of tneir war vessel, but Min
ister Shimamura semi-officially an
nounced that he would permit nothing of
the kind. He is quite well acquainted
with Councilor Akiyama, the special
Commissioner on the Naniwa, and says
he is a bricht and very intelligent man.
For a number of years Akiyama was an
attache of the Japanese legation in Lon
don, and later was with the legation in
St. Petersburg.
Minister Shimamura is of the opinion
that Mr. Akiyama's duties are mÂ«rely the
transmission of instructions lrom ihe Jap
anese Government to him and to take
back the official report thereon. He does
not think mat Mr. Akiyama's authority
will supersede his own as Minister. He
received a very iarge package of official
mail ou the steamer Cnina, but has noih
ing to give out concerning the contents.
He has, however, authorized the publica
tion of the following:
"There is no idea of intimidation in the
sending of a vessel of tue navy to Hono
lulu. The sole mission is one of inquiry,
and Hawaii has tie benefit of the doubt
as lo any infringement of Japanese treaty
rights until a calm inqury may demon
strate that this Government is in the
wrong. Even in that case there will be
no bluster about having the difficulty ad
juÃted. It will be done, il required,
througfi the decorous and polite channel*
of diplomacy."
The Naniwa was sighted about 8:30
o'clock this morning, and came to an an
chor in naval row about two hours after
ward. As she came through the channel
she hoisted the Hawaiian flag and fired a
salute of twenty-one guns, which was an
swered by the shore battery- She then
hoisted the United States flag, but fired
only thirteen nuns for Admiral Beardslee,
instead of the National salute of twenty
one guns first and then thirteen for the
admiral. The Philadelphia replied with
the usual salute, the omission to salute
the American flag before the admiral's
flag being taken for an oversight. On
board the Maron there was some indig
nation expressed over the awkwardness
of the salute, but on the Philadelphia no
notice was taken of it. It is probable that
the matter will be straightened out. Your
correspondent interviewed an officer of
the United States steamer Marion on the
saluting, and wa3 assured that the salute
to the American flag was omitted.
He also telephoned to military head
quarters. The answer was that the omis
sion to salute the flag was noticed by
them also, and ttiat they wondered
whether it was intentional or not.
There is much talk about town among
those who noticed the incident. At thiH
writing none of the Naniwa's peop:e have
come on shore. Admiral Beardslee s>>nt
his barge witn a member of his staff to
call on the captain, and this afternoon the
call is being returned. Captain Snaefer,
representing Colonel Fisher of the Ha
waiian military, made an official call on the
officers of tbe Naniwa soon after
arrival. Large numbers of Japanese lined
the wharves.

WILL PROBABLY BE REINSTATED.
Everything Favors Engineer Humphries,
Formerly of the Quartermaster's
Office at San Francisco.
Washington, d. c. May 12.â N0 de
cision will be reached in the case of James
H. Humphries, the engineer dismissed
from the quartermaster's office at San
Francisco, until Quartermaster James M.
Moore's report is received. He has been
asked by Secretary Alger to forward it
as soon as possible. Ex-Quartermaster-
General Batchelder, Senator Perkins, Gen
eral Hart and other influential people are
working for Humphries' reinstatement
It is alleged by his friends that the en
gineer who was sent to San Francisco
irom Arkansas, and who is now occupy
ing the position formerly held by Humph
ries, which pays $1800 per annum, was
guilty of the same offense charged against
Humphries, viz.; accepting compensation
for engineerinz work performed outside
of his official dudes. A singular feature
of the matter is that the Arkansas man,
who now holds thÂ« place, is a Democrat,
while Humphries (removed) is a Republi
can.
It is further alleged by Humphries'
friends thst the whole trouble was caused
by former Quartermaster Lees, who, while
stationed in Washington State recom
mended a pumping station at Spokane to
cost $60,000, which Engineer Humphries
afterward constructed at a cost of only
$1000; also, that the buildiuc of the Fort
Point seawall of b!ue stone from the quar
ries on Angel Island was another cause of
trouble between Quartermaster Lees and
Humphries.
Quarter:!: aster Kimball, who succeeded
Lees at San Francisco ar.d who was in
turn aucceedei by James M. Moore, sup
ported Humpnries in his controversy witn
Lee*, and Moore has also written a letter
to Humphries, in which he speaks of him
in the nignest terms. It is believed that
Humphries will be reinstated.
WHY AIKEN WAS DISMISSED.
Couldn't Agree With a Vermont Uatble
Company About Stone to Be Used
in Public Buildings.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 12.â 1t is
understood that Supervising Architect
Aiken said to some friends to-day that
bis dismissal was caused by the machina
tions cf the Vermont and New England
Marble Company. Mr. Aiken had ex
pressed his intention of usin^ the stone
found in the localities of Chicago and
San Francisco in the construction of these
two public buildings, and would have
continued this policy of using local stone
in the construction of most public build
ings. The Vermont company expected to
lurnishthe stone for both the Chicago
aud ban Francisco buildings.
California parties now here are trying to
have the upper structure of the San Fran
cisco Postoffice built of granite from the
Raymond quarry, California, lispresen
taiive Loud believes that the selection of
i he stone may be left to the Committee on
Public Buildings and Grounds of Con
gress, but this Is not probnble. The selec
tion is usually made by the Treasury De
partment. Loud will see Assistant Secre
tary Spalding in a day or iwo about tne
appointment or a superintendent for the
construction of the ban Francisco build
ing.
UNFIT FOR MILITARY INQUIRY.
General Merritt D sm sses the Charges of
Captain Romeyn Against Lieutenants
O'Brien and Bcmtord.
ATLANTA, Ga., May 12.â Lieutenant
O'Brien, accuser of Captain Rrjmeyn, and
Lieutenant Bamford, a leading actor in
the incidents leading up to the Romeyn
court-martial, will not ba arraigned on
tbe charges preferred by Romeyn. Gen*
eral Wesley Memtt, commanding the
army of tbe East, has declined to enter
tain the charges. The order containing
his decision in the matter is in the bands
of Major Charles Porter in charge at Fort
McPherson. General Merritt has decided
that the charge' were not presented for the
good of tbe army service, but merely as
a result of personal enmity.
The charges against. O'Brien were con
duct unbecoming an officer and drinking,
which embraced a large numoer of speci
fications. The charges against Bamford
were conduct unbecoming an officer and
gentleman, In that be had; spoken un
truthfully and without proper respect re
garding his engagement to Miss Nina
Romeyn, Romeyn's daughter, in pasting
upon thess charges General Merritt said
they were not a fit subject for military in
quiry, and it was felt that nothing bwt
the physical condition of Romeyn could
account for bis ever preferring such
charges for investigation by court-martial.
This practically ends the season of
trouble at Fort McPherson. Social rela
tions at the fort are very much strained
as a consequence of the court-martial.

life. He had been given up by all the doctors
and told to get ready to die. He had the
worst form of dyspepsia. Could not retain
any food on his stomach. So had wasted away
to nothing but skin and bones."

and a number of guests were poisoned,

TO END HIS LIFE
Asked a Prison Mate to
Bring Poison to His
Cell.
Said to Have Confessed the
Murder of Pyle to His
Companion.
The Accused Ventura County Offi
cer Certain to Be Heid
for Trial.
LOB ANGELES, Cal., May 12.â 1n a
blacksmith-shop at Newball, Justice Clay
ton presided over his court again to-day
to continue the preliminary examination
of Deputy Constable Edwia McCamish,
who is charged with the murder of Con
stable Henson McCoy Pyle at Castaic
Switch. The proceedings were enlivened
by a cumber of sensational developments
in the testimony, which is so strong
against the accused as to leave little
chance of defense. The evidence is all
circumstantial, but it grows stronger each
day.
As there have been numerous threats of
lynching, the prisoner was well guarded
by Snerifl Burr in traveling between New
hall and the County Jail. McCamish
himself maintains an air of stolid indiffer
ence, except at times wben Everett Pyle,
a brother of the deceased, comes near
him, when he shows signs of tear, know
ing thai the brother thirsts for vengeance.
Tae prosecution is being conducted by
the Assistant District Attorney, and a
strong fight is being made by the de
fendant's counsel, bQt it can avail nothing
to keep him from being bound over.
Some of the witnesses wiio testified on
Tuesday were again on the stand to-day.
McCall, the took on tne Newhall ranch,
testified to the rinding of a blocdy saddle
blanket about fifteen feet away from the
houie where the shooting occurred and in
a direction opposite to the one taken by
the tramps according to the story of Mc-
Camish. It is expected to show that Pyle
was lying with his head on this blanket
when he was -hot and the blanket was
afterward thrown into the alfalfa field
near by. It is the theory of the prosecu
tion that Pyie waa snot while as eep with
hit head on the blanket.
Mrs. Pyle, the widow, identified the two
pairs of handcuffs found in MeCamish's
room, one of them being a pair McCamish
said the fleeing iramp had carried away
iocked.upon nis wrist.
Sheriff Burr testified to the story Mc-
Camish had related to him of how the
tragedy had occurred. Farmer Busick
and Everett Pyle testified to mucn the
same facts.
The story in brief was that McCamish
and Pyle arrived at Castaic Switch in
search "of two men who, the former haa
claimed, robbed his room of certain cloth-
Ing and other articles. The two officers
made beds of some sacks in the sta.ion
building and went to sleep. They were
awakened about 4 a. m. by two men walk
ing on the railroad track. When the two
strangers were nearly opposite the build
ing Pyle ordered theni to throw up their
hands, which order was complied with.
Pyie then gave his revolver to McCamish
to kÂ»Â«p the prisoners cover d, bo that he
could be free to put the handcuffs on
them. Wnen he had snapped the brace
lets on one hand of one of the men the
other man shot Pyle and both tied.
Pyie fell, so McCamish Â»ays, partly in
side the bui.ding, and while he lay there
the tramu shot him again. As the two
fehows ran away McCamish fired at them
Bnd hit one, who said ''I'm shot," and
stopped running iong enough to retrace
his way a few steps and pick up a ouud'.e
he had dropped and then resumed his
flight.
The idea that a man running away fr m
a revolver should b? so reckless as to stop
in tnat way was one ot the features that
cast discredit on the whole story.
Everett Pyie testified regarding the
footprints, that the only marks of that
kind to be found were a day old and had
been made by two honest laborers, who
caaiped near by.
Sheriff Charlebois o* Ventura spruns a
sensation in telling of a confession" of ti;e
accused man. A prisoner confined in the
Ventura jail claimed that McCamish,
while locken up in the same place, bad
virtually admitted hi-j guilt. The
prisoner told McCamish about the find
ing of the clothing and the other things
that he claimed were carried away, and
McCamish became much agitated, ex
claiming, "Ob, my God, what will I do?"
McCamish, according to the prisoner's
story, as told by the Sheriff, asked his cell
companion, who was soon to be released,
to com* and see him in the Los An.e'.es
jail and bring him some poison, imply
ing the intenuon of committing suicide.
The prisoner who was then with Mc-
Camish will testify at the examination to
morrow, and will be brought from Ventura
NEW TO-DAY.

This wonderful invention cures all waste of power by a simple vitalizing of the weakened
nerves. As they are saturated with its strengthening force they become vigorously con-
tracted; the loosened cords are restored to their normal condition and all waste is quickly
checked.. The true vigor of manhood then becomes evident Tne body is made strong and the
mind clear. Ambition springs up in the brain and the happiness which can come only from
healthy vital force is yours. The effect of this electrical treatment is wonderful as Dr. Sanden
applies It He has a special style of applying his belt for weak men, the result of thirty years
of study. All other electrical appliances have failed, and Dr. Sanden has cured simply be-
cause of this scientific application of his belt, which is known only to Dr. Sanden.
"I wore your electric belt two months now and can say I am a better man and stronger
than I ever was. I feel no weakness in my back any more, ana I have no more losses and my
eves are clear. You are at liberty to refer any sufferer to me. It will be a great pleasure for
me to write to others and tell them what Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt has done for me," writes
L. WALKER, Beckwith, CaL, April 25, 1897.
"I am not sorry for buying my Sanden Belt, for it has done more for me than I ever hoped
for. All losses are stopped and good color has come to my cheeks. I only wish I had got it
be lore I spent my money on quacks, but I guess we all have to learn by experience. I know
â ire now than I did a year ago, and I am going to send all my friends to you," is what ED-
WARD BERRYESSA oi Berryessa, Santa Clara County, Cal.. says May 11, 1897.
Young men, in justice to yourself, knowing that this continual waste of vital strength will
in time ruin your constitution, and seeing the wonderful cures being accomplished by the
Dr. Sanden Electric Belt, you must help yourself. Thousands of young men who were on the
road to destruction by this drain have been restored to physical health by this means, and so
can you. So act to-day. Get one of these Belts and cure yourself. Full information about it

for the purpose. Witnesses will also
testify to having examined the dead
man's eyes and rinding proof that when
he was shot his eyes were closed, presum
ably in sleep.
One witness who did much to (rive Mc-
Camish a bad character and establish a
motive was Alfred Stone, who testified
that the defendant had proposed to him
to assist in robbing a bank at Santa Paula,
which would be a commendable enter
prise for two hard-working young men.
McCamish then said that the only man
he was afraid oi was Pyle.
Cooli** to B* JJcportrd.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 12.â The
seven Chinese coolies who landed illegally
at San Juan Capistrano the other day and
were captured by Deputy United States
Marshal Forster were examined by United
States Commissioner Van Dyke to-day
and ordered deported. It was shown that
the coolies had come from Mexico in a
schooner, the captain of which had bar
gained to land them in the United States.
He landed them all right, but they fell
into the hand* of the waiting officer, who
wan tea to catch the smuggling schooner,
but had no way of reaching her. The
coolies will be taken to San Francisco to
morrow to be dispatched to China.
Settle on <!>â¢ Fruit Tree*.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 12.â There
is said to be much scale on the citrus fruit
trees in this county, and prompt action is
required to check the pests. The County
Horticultural Commissioners, J. M.
Thomas, E. H. Ruik and C. G. Kellogg,
are now engaged in s careful inspection
of the fruit trees, and in some localities
will resort to heroic measures. No pan
of the county is safe from the three great
enemies of the citrus treesâ red, black and
purple scaleâ though in some sections the
pest is doing greater damage than in
others. There is a good deal of purple
scale at and around Downey.
MILLERTON DAM WASHED AWAY.
Third Collapse of the Structure Built
to Drain a Pool With a
Go/den Bed.
FRESNO, Cal., May 12.â For the third
time a portion of the daiii built by the
Ohio Gold Mining Company across the
San Joaquin River, about three miles
above Miilerton, has been washed away.
Last Thursday nig-t the top of the struc
ture, to a depth of about ten feet, was car
ried away by the stream, which is now
running very high. The dam was thirty
six feet in height and ten feet off the top
amounts to a big loss.
The dam was built to tarn the stream
through a channel constructed around a
section of t. c river bed, where, it is be
lieved, there are rich deposits of goia.
When the water was low in ihe summer
and the artificial course could convey the
whole stream it was proposed to mine the
gravel in the dry riverbed. Had the dam
stood for another mouth the company
would have then commenced active opera
tions to dig out the weal tv whicL was to
repay it for the expenditure of $18,000 and
three years of hard work.
The place where the yellow metal is
â ought under such great disadvantages is
at the po ; nt where Fine Gold Creek emp
ties it* flood waters from the foothills in
toe winter time into the river. A rock
formation at the mouth of the creek turns
the tributary stream s.mo-t against the
current* of the river, resulting in a very
strong eddy. This eddy is supposed to
have caused a wonderfully rich deposit of
asriferous gravel, brought down by both
the river and the creek. Miners have
always insisted that great wealth lay at
the bottom of the pool. It is not known
as yet whether the dam will be recon
structed.

Sautalito Merchants Angry.
SAUSALITO.CaI., May 12.â The trouble
caused by Commodore Billings of the San
Francisco Yacht Club in mooring his yacht
Nixie in the pathwa/ of the Government's
vessels has resulted in a petition to the
Board of Town Trustees by many of the
merchants of Sau?alito, in which they ap
peal to the Trustees to enforce the ordi
nance passed by them a week ago, com
pelling yacbts to obiain permission from
the board before anchoring. The petition
was presented to the Trustees to-night at
a special meeting. The merchants claim
that their trade is injured by Commodore
Billings and his yacnt and they wish the

NO LONGER DREAD
THE YAQUI WHOOP
Mexicans at Last Con
clude a Treaty With
the Tribe.
Peace Articles to Be Signed
With Solemn Ceremony at
Tetacombiate.
After Nearly a Hundred Years of
Strife the Braves Will Bury
the Hatchet.
HERMOSILLO, Mexico, May 12.â At a
small town, Tetacombiate, in Western
Sonora, on the coming Saturday will oc
cur the ceremony whereby the Yaqui na
tion will acknowledge allegiance to the
republic of Mexico. For over a hundred
years this brave tribe has defied and de
feated all the forces the republic could
send into Western Sonora. Thousands of
Mexican soldiers have been slaughtered
in the warfare, but at no time have the
Federal forces been victorious. The
tribesmen have been merciful after their
victories. They are devout Catholics, and
the warfare on their part has at no time
been attended by the usual Indian atroci
ties.
For a year or more, under the instruc
tions of President Diaz, Governor Ramon
Corral and Military Commandant General
Luis Torres of Sonora have been treating
with the tribe for peace. Their overtures
have been accepted, and success has at
tended their efforts throughout.
A great assembly of the Yaquis has
been held, and the terms of amnesty of
fered by the Mexican Government have
been accepted. A proclamation of "gen
eral and glorious peace" has therefore
been issued by Juan Maldonado, chief of
the trios and commander of its army.
Thii proclamation has been formally read
in the eight cities of the Yaqui nation
and has been dispatched by carriers
throughout Northern Mexico. The sign
ing of the treaty will be made an occasion
of the utmost solemnity and will be fol
lowed by a fiesta, in which thousands of
Mexicans and Yaquis will participate in
friendiy union.
The peace is especially advantageous to
a syndicate of New York capitalists now
constructing, with Indian labor, an im
mense canal in the Rio Yaqni Valley to
irrigate a million-acre concession pro
cured from the Mercan Government,

STILL IN MA RIM'S PRISON.
Jail Life Beginning to Show Its Effect
Upon Millionaire Peter A.
Finigan.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., May 12.â Down in
the recesses of the County Jail, in the
basement of Marin County's Courtnouse,
almoat forgotten and growing thinner
every day, is Colonel Peter A. Finigan,
mine-owner and breeder of fine horses.
For over a month now the man who is
reputed to be a millionaire has been tn
the custody of Sheriff Harrison.
Tbe close confinement is beginning to
tell upon him, and the little exercise he
obtains has not been conducive to good
health and fine spirits. The curiosity of
the puDlic has compelled him to resort to
unusual methods in order o remain in
obscurity. Oat-riders would persist m
coming to the door of Colonel Finiean's
cell and with cool impertin ence glare at
him through the opening in the iron
barricade. Finally, when tbia had been
carried to extremes, the wealthy prisoner
closed the openings by spreading a news
paper over them, and then the vulgar
gaze of the multitude no longer annoyed
nim
In the County Jail with Finigan there
is but one other prisoner â a Chinaman,
said to be insane, lie occupies the famous
"haunted ceil" and says he hears voices
in the night.
But the days of Colonel Finigan's con
finement are coming to an end. The $750
which he muit pay in order to co free will
be foithcoming and the trial of the divorce
suit will follow. It is said that the release
of the wealthy prisoner will be effected
this week. When seen to-day Colonel
Finigan was uncommunicative in re
gard to his chances for leaving his prison

"It's not so bad," he said, but it can
be plainly seen that the confinement, the
want of fresh air and the worry are teliing
upon him. Ha wears dark glasses to shield

SALAJiIt.S OF COyaTASLES.
Judge Bxtdd of Stockton Ren&tr* a Deci
*lon in a Teat < it*.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 12.â Judge Bndd
of the Superior Conrt this forenoon ren
dered a decision important to the Con
stables and Justices of the State. It was
in the suit brought by Constables Carroll
and Beach of Stockton Township for a
salary of $100 a month each. Under the
t^rms of the new fee bill County Auditor
Keagle, in order to be on the safe side, re
fu-ed to pay the claims until a judicial de
termination was had. The Auditor wa<
thereupon mandamused anc* the court
ordered the payment of the money under
the proTision of tbe new fee bill.
The contention was whether in changing
the compensation from a fee to a salary
basis the compensation was increased,
contrary to the constitution. The conn
held, however, that inasmuch as fees were
contingent upon tbe amount of work and
a salary a fixed quantity, there was no
criterion by which ihey could be meas
ured. The decision is not well received by
the county Constables and Justices, for
they will now receive oniy a compara
tively small salary, instead of the big lees
whicii they heretofore drew down.
DUMXAXI'S LAST APPEAL.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 12.â The
petition for the pardon of Theodore Dur
rant was filed to-day in the Governor's
office. It sets forth that he denied a
fair trial and that the minds of the people
at targe were biased against him by rea
son of the articles pabliihed in San Fran
cisco papers, as were the jurors who acted
in the case, who were, it is claimed, in
fear of popular prejudice. He protests
his entire innocence and asks a pardon or
commutation of sentence. Friday morn
ing has been set for the hearing of the
petition.

ease While Coins: to Sur
render to Officers.
VALLEJO, Cal., May 12.â 1n a fight
this afternoon on the Gore ranch, three
miles east of Vallejo, Michael Ford struct
William Kin? over the head with a shovel,
fracturing his iKull. Ford started for
town co deliver himself to me authorities
and dropped dead near the railroad sta
tion, presumably from heart disease.
King says that Ford tried to drop a sack
of wheat on his dog;, and when he remon
strated Ford sharply replied that he would
kill both him and his doe, and proceeded
to carry the threat into execution.
Another version is that the men were in
town together during the morning and
drove home to unload tome groceries.
Ford, it is said, placed a box containing
some of the groceries on King's shoulder.
The latter was too weak to hold the weight
and dropped the box to the ground. He
became angry and began to abuie Ford.
The latter believed that King was about
to do him some bodily injury, and to pro
tect himself he grasped & shovel which
was near by, intending to bit King with
the flat portion of it. The shovel turned
as he swung it through the air and one of
the sharp edges struct King right on the
center of the head, inflicting a very severe
wound. While King lay moaning on the
ground Ford picked him up and pillowed
his head en a sack.
Ford was known as a quiet and inoffen
sive man, while King is said to have an
unenviable record, being always looking
for trouble. It is said that he accidentally
killed a man on the Morgan ranch a num
ber of years ago.
An inquest will be held to-morrow
morning to ascertain the cause of Ford's
death. Dr. J. J. Hogan, who examined
King's wound, says that he cannot lire.
SUIT FOR DELAMAR LAND.
Litigation Involving the Possession of (he
Townsite Begins at Car
son.
CARSON CITY, Net., May 12.â The
case of Patrick bonner Â«t al. vs. Merkle
et al., involving a portion of the townsite
of Delamar, was began in the United
States court to-day. The defendants lo
cated tne Naiad Queen mining claim and
during the gold excitement people rushed
in and built a town over tne mine. Other
claims were located about the Queen and
purchased by Delamar. The defendants
are endeavoring to procure a patent and :
the plaintiffs have instituted proceedings
to prevent it on the ground that there is
no mineral in the Queen claim. If the
located claim can be patented the prop- ;
erty thereon w>ll Belong to the patentee.
P. Bonner, in whose name the case was
brought, was the nnt witness, fie said j
the ground was not mineral and sample*
taken by him showed but a slight trace of
moral. He admitted that he knew of the j I
location of the claim when he bought the ! |
property, but thought no trouble would i
arise. Bonner asserts that about half of
rhe peopip are assisting him in this suit, j i
The remainder are friends of the company j
and will not interfere.
The loss of the case will be a serious one
to the plaintiffs, as most of them pur
chased the land for Duilding at high fig
ures from people who bad no right to sell
it. The interests of over 500 people are
involved.

FOREST GROVE. Ob., May 12.â Anton
Pfapner, a banker here, has received a let

stolen from the banker some years ago. :
A scrawl, presumably from the converted

Six years ago last October Mr. Pfanuer,

Getting: Down to Businessâ Some
Constitutional Amendments. |
Ladles' Auxiliary.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 12.-one
continuous round of pleasure is the lot of
railroad conductors and their companions,
who seem to have taken possesion of the
city. From early morning to late at
night the visitors are on the go taking in
the sights of the city and environs. Large
parties also ascend the mountains or go
down to the beach.
Even the delegates to the International
Convention of tne Order of Railroad Con
ductors did not do much business to-day,
though closeted in secret during the after
noon. There was less thau a full at
tendance. The meeting of the Grand Di
vision opened at 1 p. m. in Music Hall with
Grand Chief Conductor Clark presiding.
No details of the proceedings are given
out, but it is asserted that little of impor
tance wa? done beyond assigning to the
various committees the work they have to
do. These committees are:
Judiciaryâ George Miles, W. H. Budd,
J. L. Klssick, E. Reynolds and F. A.
Tompkins.
Grand officers' reports â J. D. Condit,
Tim Farrell, W. F. Knight, W. H. Scholes
and F. E. Tewksbury.
Grievances and appealsâ W. Kilpatrick,
T. S. Me Bee, O. J. Freeman, J. M. Van
slyke and W. W. Stockweli.
Division reportsâ G. E. Vance, J. C.
Sheldon, John McKay, George McGilveny
and George Lumpkin.
Some discussion was had over a number
of proposed amendments to the constitu
tion before their reference to the commit
tee. The discussion of these amendments
developed the first indication of the
slightest discord in the order, some dele
gales demanding a radical change in the
sections pertaining to the character of
grievances that can be made a basis for a
strike.
Some action is also likely to be taken
that will put tbe conductors more in line
witn tbe Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers. One subject that threatened
atone time to cau.e some hard feelings
pertains directly to the relation the order
holds to other labor organizations and the
federation. In the opinion of some of the
most radical delegates the order baa been
too lax in discriminating against orders
opposed to corporations and individual
employers who are known to be antago
nistic to organized labor.
One subject that will not be disposed of
in entire harmony is a local one, and a
matter growing out of the last big strike
in California. At that time when the con
ductors on the Santa Fe lines in Southern
California went out with the strikers their
places were filled b} r non-union men,
some of whom had been conductors some
where at some time and others had held
other positions in the miiroad service.
When the strike was settled General
Manager K. H. Wade, since deceased, de
clined to discharge the non-union con
ductors, and his firm stand in their de
fense bridged over the difficulty. Since
that time tne scars of battle have so worn
away that some of the non-union con
ductors now desire to become affiliated
with the order, and it is understood some
such applications are on iiie with the
proper officers of tbe Grand Division.
These are but a few of the points that will
encage the attention of the convention
during the remainder of the week.
The ladies' auxiliary had another busi
ness meeting thla afternoon, when com
mittees were appointed, reports read and
twenty-four new members admittea. This
is a secret organization also, and informa
tion about it is withheld, but the ladies
do not strike or threaten to strike. The
objects of the auxiliary were set forth by
Mrs. J. H. Mooie, the grand president, in
a brief a.idress at the reception. She said,
after referring in a general wav to the or
der: "Erroneous ideas concerning the
auxiliary have gained some headway, and
I wish to say that it ib the belief of all that
membership in our organization is an
honor of highest character. It develops
strength, judcmens, self-reliance and char
acter. It stimulate! friendship and love
and fidelity."
Later, after speaking of the responsibil
ity and importance which attached to the
work of the railway conductor, Mrs.
Moore said: "Ail of them hold positions
of honor and trust, but the influence of
their wive 3is greater than any other
power that exists. The man who has a
wife at home has an influence for better
things forever witn him. The responsi
bility of a family urges him to greater
achievements. The responsibility makes
him a hero. Home influence is the
mightiest influence of all."
The principal outdoor event in the pro
gramme to-day was the Wild West show
i-iven in honor of the visitors at the Fiesta
Park, this afternoon ana this evening, be
ginning with displays of horsemanship
and vaquero practice and ending, at a late
hour, with fireworks. The afternoon show
was not well attended, the strangers seem
ingly preferring to sea the more natural
sights of scenery, flowers and orange trees.
The headquarters of the Railway Con
ductors' Club of North America has been
established at the Westminster, room 205,
Conductor Weisz, managing trovernor, is
in charge, and there are with him several
other govarnors of the club. The club has
an elegant clubhouse in New York, and
their dinners have become events, which
are most successful in the way of accom
plishing the end for which the club was
established. The objects of the club are:
To bring the conductors of North America
together on a social basis for the discus
sion of subjects of vital importance to
conductors and railway interests in gen
eral, and for the commercial welfare of
this and adjoining countries; to pro
mote arbitration and to relegate to
oblivion that element which by
its acts of violence has shown Itself un
worthy of the confidence and support of
the public; to educate the conductor to
the requirements of the various business
interests by inviting men of effairs to sub
mit to the flub such information as they
would deem beneficial in the conducting
of passenger and freight service as viewed
from interests they represent; to bring to
gether the employer and employe, so that
they may better understand each other.
witli the ultimate object that railroad traf
fic may continue prosperously and thus
advance the interests of all classes of busi
ness.
There is much good feeling exhibited in
the crowds at the hotels and on the
streets.
J. Clark Sheldon, known among Lis
friends as the "punch fiend," is among
the conductors now in the city. Mr. Shel
don, who is from Weehawken, N. J., and
a conductor on the "West Bhore Railroad,
has with him & book which he values
very highly. It contains the punch, marks
and signatures of 530 conductors, and is
probably the most complete collection of
the kind in existence. He began the work
in 1887, since which, time he bag never ai
lowed a conductor with his punch to pass
him without first getting his signature.
To-morrow the visitors will go by spe
cial train to Pasadena and elsewhere, in
cluding the ostrich farm.

LOS ANGELES, CaI., May 12.â At the
Wild West show to-night the crowd of
conductors was treated to one feature not
on the prosramrae. A squad of fifteen
members of the National Guard, carrying
gu'isand fixed bayonets, demanded ad
mission to the grounds, claiming to be in
search of deserters. Their free entrance
was opposed by the doorienders, but the
militiamen crowded in and would have
had everything their own way but for the
special police, who, with drawn clubs,
finally put to flignt the bold soldier boys
with their bayonets. For a time a small
riot was imminent.
THE ARIZONA MAN-HUNT.
Outlaw Parker Eludes Posses Sent From
Prescott and Pt.wnix to
Capture Him.
PRESCOTT, Ariz., May 12.-It is now
apparent that Parker, the escaped irain
robber, eluded the posses sent after him
from Prescott and Phcenix by swinging
toward the north, into the upper Verde
Valley instead of into Tonto Basin, where
he has many Iriends and where he was a
participant "in the b.oody Pleasant Valley
war. Assistant General Manager R. E.
Wells of the Santa Fe, Prescott and
Phoenix Railway is taking the keenest
interest in the chase and has placed
several special trains at the disposal of the
pursuers. Late last night, on application
of Sheriff Runner, a special traiu was sent
to Ashfork to tate to Jerome Junction
the three Hualpai Indian scouts who
trailed Parker down after the Rock Cut
train robbery. At midnight last night
the following information was received
from Sheriff Ruffner:
I ran Parker out of Lynx Creek Mountains
about 10 o'clock yesterday morning; trailed
him to the Bluck Hills and stayed in the hills
last night. Think I'ariier saw us yesterday
evening just before dusk. Tracked him about
for y-five miles to-day. He could not have
been nitre ihau three hours ahead of us at any
time. His horse is evidently very tired and
neither he nor his horse hus had anything to
eat for over fifty hours. Think wo have a sure
thingin the morning.
PHCENIX, Ariz., May 12.â Governor
Franklin to-day issued a proclamation
offering $500 reward for the apprehension
of Parker, tne murderer of Lee >'orns at
Prescott; $500 for Miller, his confederate,
and $250 for Cornelia, the Mexican who
escaped with tne others. Parker is sup
posed to be in tne Blacfc Hills, near the
Verde River, about twenty-five miles
north of Prescott; Miller to be hiding in
the Bradshaw Mountains, unable to move
on account of iiis wound, and Corneiia to
have sought refuge with the Mexican
placer miners in Santa Domingo Gulch,
near Wickenburg.
Sheriff Orme will start a posse from
Wickenburq; to-morrow morning to hunt
the Mexican down. He has also set a
watch on all the trails leading out of the
mountains southward. Parker now has
$6000 reward on his head, the payment of
most of it depending on his conviction for
participation in thÂ« Rock Cut train
robbery, in which his confederate was
killed.

THE DANGER OF
EXPERT TESTIMONY
It Was a Subject for De
bate in the Fair-Craven
Trial.
The Denunciation of It by the
Supreme Court Is
Quoted.
Pho'osraphy and the Magnifying of
Handwriting Was Another
Theme for Discussion-
Expert testimony on handwriting re
ceived a trouncing on general prin
ciples yesterday in the Fair-Craven
trial. D. M. Delraas, leading coun
sel for the defense, led the
charge, and while it wai in its nature pre
liminary, still it was an indication that
the experts who, it is alleged, will testify
that the signature of James G. Fair to
Mrs. Nettie Craven's deeds is spurious *re
not destined to tread a path strewn with
roses in this particular case.
The debate during which the scoring of
this class of evidence was administered
took place during the afternoon, when
John P. Donovan took the witness-stand.
This gentleman earns has livelihood by
enlarging pictures and following the busi
ness of general photography.
He said in answer to Attornoy Mitchell
that he had been engaged by the Fair
estate to reproduce on a magnified scale
a number of the late millionaire's signa
tures. He had the original negatives in
court with him, and when told to do so
produced them ana identified them. Some
of Attorney It. B. Mitchell's help now
came trooping into the courtroom bearing
a varied assortment of bundle*. These
were the enlarged photographs of Fair's
hank-check signature, and there was a
great pile of them. Mr. Donovan iden
tified these as specimens of his handi
work, and then Mr. Mitchell offered them
in evidence "for the purpose of future
comparisons of the genuine and disputed
signatures of the late James G. Fair."
Mr. Deinias objected to them, and in
telling why he did so claimed that the
copies were inadmissible under the law
and objectionable on general principles.
He read trom a decision of Judge Camp
bell of the Michigan Supreme Court, in
which that eminent jurist deals severely
with photographic copies in tests of al
leged forgery on account of their unrelia
bility, and in which be also decries the
idea of taking too much stock in evidence
given by handwriting experts. "Tne lat
ter gentry," wrote Judge Campbell, "are
very often found to be mere pretenders to
knowledge, and their testimony is in the
nature or an evil." Mr. Delmas argued
that the Campbell decision was sound
law, and law that ought to prevail in this
case. Under the California Code, be said,
copies of documents were not competent
evidence to go to the jury when the orici
nals were obtainable. Ho said he would
not object to allowing the jury to exam
ine originals.
Air. Mitchell combated the position of
the defense by reading a lot of authorities
tending to show that photographs of wills
and documents were allowable for pur
poses of identification and comparison.
Among his supporting references was
United States Circuit Judge Deady's de
cision in the celebrated Sharon case. In
that decision the opinion was given that
enlarged copies of documents were useful
in cases of disputed handwriting.
Mr. Delmas in reply cited the recent
decision of the California Supreme Court
in the case of the People vs. Buckley. In
that case, he said, the highest State
tribunal reversed a conviction for forgery
just because that conviction had been
secured by means of expert testimony on
handwriting. Tne court denounced this
kind of evidence as dangerous and un
reliable. The experts testify whichever
way they are paid to testify, and it was
a pernicious custom that the courts had
permitted to develop in allowing much of
this kind of evidence and one that it
wou d be found difficult to eradicate.
Mr. Delmas laid particular stress upon
the conclnding declaration of the court,
to the effect that conviction and impris
onment, founded altogether upon the
testimony of experts on handwriting, was
"an outrage upon justice." The attorney
said that if enlarged photographs and
expert testimony on handwriting were
tolerated the trial would start off with
one of the lowest and most despicable
classes of evidence known to the legal
fraternity. If the jury was to make com
parisons of signatures, genuine and dis
puted, the originals alone could be prop
erly used.
The argument was carried on by both
sides uniil quite late, and when a ruling
was finally due Judge Slack said he would
admit the photographiccopies, but merely
for the purpose of "illustration and con
venience."
Mr. Delmas remarked that if illustra
tion and convenience would be the limit
of the evidence's potency he would not
object to it at all. But he gave warning
that any attempt to use the enlargements
for any other purpose would be vigorously
opposed by the defense.
Expert Theodore Kytka occupied the
witness-stand during the forenoon session,
testifying that he took a number of photo
graphs of samples of Senator Fair's hand

The doctors of the Hudson Medical Institute have made a wonderful discovery.
It is a discovery that no other physician can dispute; because it does its work thor-
oughly and harmlessly. Now, you may have heard of Hudyan, but you would
never believe that the Hudyan Remedy treatment is sent all the way to St. Louis,
in the State of Missouri, and that this wonderful remedy-treatment is opening the
ey^sof the doctors of St. Louis, Here is a testimonial letter. Read it:
ST. LOUIS, Mo., February 26, 1897.
. ..... HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTEâ Dear Doctors: It is a great pleasure for me to confess
that my health is improving wonderfully : that dull, horrid feeling of low spirits has left me
entirely, and now I have the greatest confidence in your restoring my health. I have not
that tired feeling that used to make my life not worth living. / It is a torture to me to think of
why I did not begin treatment when you first became Interested in my case, for I would then
have been completely restored to perfect manhood long ago.
I was down to see my old physician. He has a staff of five assistants. I told him your
Hudyan remedy- treatment did me more good in one month than his medicine had done in nine
months. He excused himself by saying my case had baffled the skill of 60 many doctors.
Certainly your remedy-treatment Is a wonder. 1: ; .;. :â >%.â" , .-

writing and other chirographical exhibits
to be used in the trial. He had brought
the negatives of these, pome sixty in all,
with him, and after appropriate indentifi
cation they were put in evidence as the
plaintiff's exhibits. Under cross-exami
nation Kytka admitted that he wus un
der salary to the Fair estate.
. There was some clover fencing in the
afternoon when Mr. Mitchell recalled
Charles S. Neal, the former secretary of
Senator Fair, to the stand and asked him
to identify the handwriting of the mil
lionaire in a letter alleged to have been
written by the deceased. All o! the
samples so far introduced have carried
witn them an explanation that they were
merely to be used "for comparison."
They will naturally be handled and read by
the jury. Now it. happened that this new
sample wnich Mr. Mitchell wae so anxious
to put into the evidence had another vir
tue, as it were, besides that of being a
sample of Fair's writing. It's wording
was such that, if read by the jury, it migh t
tend to prejudice that body, for it was a
treatise on rich men's wills.
The defense was awake, however, and
opposed theintroduction of the document.
And it was not until cfter a spell of de
bate and after a promise had been exacted
from MilcLe 1 to the effect that he would
reaort to no trick*, that the objection to
the sample was withdrawn.

Peixotto Again Turns U.i a
Winner
The cold weather detracted from the at
tendance at Emeryville yesterday, the
crowd b ing considerably less than on the
preceding days of the week. The racing,
though, was very good and arparently
clean from jobbery. Favorites were suc
cessiul in captuiing purses on three essays
out of six.
In the mile and a furlong handicap In
stÂ»lla*or turned the tables on Wheel of
Fortune, winning in fast time with ease,
while the mare failed toget a mark. Both
opened in ihe betting at 11 to 5, the Wheel
going back at post time to sto 2. After
something over six furlongs had been
covered, with Flashlight sotting the race,
Freeman took the lead with Installator,
and the Brutus horse passed the judges a
length in iront of Judge Denny with some
thing in reserve, covering the distance in
I:c4'o. Lobengula was third.
Ihe 9 to 5 favorite, Manchester, ridden
by Ciawson, captured the first race, a six
furlong selling affair. Getting away
jioorlv he passed one after another of his
field, and at the end won driving a head
before Horatio, an Bto 1 shot. Roltaire
secured tbe show. Nebuchadnezzar, on
â which there was a good stiff play, finished
fourth.
c.reen Morris 1 mare, Sallie Cliquot, was
a prohibitiva 9 to 20 cnance lor the six
furiong purse run that followed, but Pig
pott got her away from the post very
badly, and after waJinr her away through
i!;e bunch got up in time to be beaten out
â a length by the gray horse Sir Richard,
against which 15 to 1 was laid. The win
ner was cleverly piloted by fiennessy.
Heartsease, at 40 to 1. landed in the siiow,
r dden by Holmes, quite a promising boy.
lne Oakland stabie's fast filly Torsida
downed her company very impressively
in the two-year-old scramble ai five fur
longs, going to the post at odds of 9
to 2. Rosormonde with top weight up was
t lie post favorite, but was beaten by the
time the stretch was reached. Elsmore
got the best of a very straggling start, and
was not overhauled by Torsida until the
last tifty yards, when sho beat him out a
length in 1:02^. The well-backed To
v.anda was thirU.
With but 88 pounds to carry, Fortunate
looked to have it all his own way in the
miif selling affair, and wasjweil supported
at odds of 2 to 1. Stevens, who had the
mount, passed Frank Jaubert turning
into the backstretc:;, and Holly's horse,
never pressed, won handily from Adam
Andrew in I:42U'. Billy McCioskey, a2O

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 13, 1897.
ALMOST READY
FOR THE JURY
Hebbard's Gag-Law Case
Reaches the Closing
Hours.
And Strangely Enough He De
clines to Be His Own
Witness
Attorney Hinkle Comes to Grief in
Casting Insinuations Upon Mr
Shortridge
A quality that nobody believed Judge
J. C. B. Hebbard guilty of during the last
campaign he displayed to a most â upris
ing degree yesterday. When the moment
for him arrived to laka the witness-stand
to vindicate himself of the various
criticisms that have been passed of his
merits as a politician and a candidate for
the bench arrived he was modesty itself
in declining the opportunity. As a re-
MR. AND MRS. WALTER N. BRUNT and the Beautiful Attendants of the Fair Bride.
suit the Marriott libel case slipped along
to the closing hours as if oiled.
The afternoon saw the delivery of the
opening argument by Assistant District At
torney Hintle. It was marked by a rattier
sensational incident. Hinkle abused court
room courtesy to such an extent as to cast
insinuations on the professional character
of the defendant's counsel, which the
lawyer resented indignantly ana with
withering contempt.
As soon as the court opened in the
morning Mr. Shortridge made a request
for the w hereabouts of John Gnmage, who
was Hebbard's private detective during
the last campaign. He learned that the
detective had disappeared.
Police Officer Flint, who had attempted
to serve the Bubpena, reported that his
game had "gone to Sacramento" and his
return was a matter of doubt. Mr. Short
ridge thought this rather singular, inas
much as ihe detective had been in daily
attendance on the irial until the word
went out that he was to be called as a
witness. Hebbard had promised to have
Gamage in court.
"As we cannot find this witness and as
Ido Dot wish to delay matters, we rest
our case," Â«aid Mr. Shortridge.
It was now the turn of Judge Hebbard
to cover himself with glory in rebuttal,
and court and jury prepared for the or
deal. Attorney Kahn Held a consultation
with his client and then District Attorney
Hinkle was taken into the deliberations.
Receiver Sheehan and James Aiva Watt
soon joined the circle, but still the ex
pected did not happen. No intimation oi
the sudaen climax that was at hand was
given as Sheehan was asked to take the
stand an 1 pay tribute to his brilliant
record as receiver of the People's Home
Savings Bank. Attorney Kahn tried to
make tne way easy by asking questions
that covered pretty nearly everytuing in
the encyclopedia.
First Kahn was for having him tell of
his acquaintance with Marriott and of his
dealings with Percy Goldstone, an adver
tistng sol'citor of the News- Letter. Gold
stone had one called upon Sheehan to
solicit a 'â¢write-up" of some kind orother
and things were progressing very nicely.
Where this line of inquiry would have
stopped is a matter of conjecture had not
Mr. Shortridge protested against it as
very remote from the case. Judge Dainger
field ordered it stricken from the record,
and a new start was made.
Kahn had Sbeelian relate how courteous
he had been to the depositors, and every
body else for that matter. The details of
his discharge were not touched upon.
Sheeban declared he had turned over
every bit of the bank's property to the
directors before he asked for his walking
card, tbough for somt reason he forgot to
recall the protests of Attorneys Spelling
and bartnett against his release by Judge
Hebbard until he had made a prooer ac
counting.
Kahn piloted him safely also around
more rocks. There was the famous chapter
related by PMward Livernash of the
Examiner, who, as attorney for R.
H. McDonald, was not allowed to
vote 2100 shares of stock at the stock
holders' meeting of the bank in July,
1894. Livernash had related on the stand
that it was throuph Sheehan and Watt's
manipulations that the stock that had
been transferred to bim in behalf of the
depositors was tied ud and juggled into
temporary uselessness. Livernash's story
bad been one of the sensational incidents
of the case, yet not a word did Sheehan
bave to say in reference to it. Evidently
it was a bad apple which he decided to
leave severely alone.
The read ng of Sbeehan'a list of assets,
which he turned over to the bank after bis
receivership, followed, and Sheehan took
bis seat.
Then it was that the announcement
was made by Attorney Kahn that he
"rested bis case." much to everybody's
surprise.
Judge Hebbard had declined to take the
stand !
The jury then went to lunch in order to
prepare itself Tor the arguments of the
lawyers.
Assistant District Attorney Hinkle had
the afternoon to himselt to explain to
the jury what a vicious thing ii was to
criticize a political candidate, and eÂ»pe
cially such a "noble, honest citizen as
Judge J. C B. Hebbard."
Hinkle began by reading Marriott's ed
itorial criticizing Hebbard's candidacy,
during the last campaign, to the jury.
The News Letter proprietor, the Assistant
D strict Attorney said, had pieaded not
guilty to the charge of libel, and it then
devolved upon him to justify his opinion
as expressed in his paper. Hebbard was
a candidate for re-election, and it was for
the jury to decide if the motive of the
editorial was to defeat his success at tbe
polls. Practically the whole case was
connected with the failure of tds Peo
rle's Home Savings Bank and subse
quent litigation, and accordingly Hinkie
proceeded to recite his version of that
piece of history.
The defense, continued Hinkle, turned
on the declaration that Sheehan and Watt
had "connived and logrolled" to get con
trol of the bank.
Hinkle bÂ»gan to warm op. He was fear
ful that ia his admiration for Judge Heb
bard his heart niisrht get the better of his
head, so he said, and proDably it was this
misguided fervor that got him into trou
ble a few minutes later.
He began reeling off the virtues of Shee
han. Watt and Hebbard in a manner that
would have given a phonograph apoplexy,
and when he got tangled up in the various
items of the receiver's schedule of tne
bank's assets his words came vituperative
and abuse-logged.
There were references to "Delmas and
Shortridge, the attorneys for the Dick
McDonald board of directors," and an
unwarranted and insulting insinuation
that they bad, as attorneys for the bank,
retained in their possession a note
from C. A. Swan berg for $40 000,
which Receiver Sheehan could not find in
the bank's assets.
Mr. Shortridge was on his feet in a mo
ment to resent the insult.
Hinkle knew, said Mr. Shortridge, that
the reflections meant 10 be conveyed were
I not in accordance with facts. He knew
| they were absolutely unfounded and un
qualifiedly false.
Hinkle began to quibble, when he was
interrupted by Mr. Shortridge, who in
dignantly exclaimed:
"I won't permit any living man to make
any such false insinuation about me as
this person has done as long as there is a
drop of blood in my body."
Judge Daingerfield attempted to calm
the storm by expressing a fear that
Hinltle's "continuity of thought might be
interrupted." Mr. Snortridge, however,
said he cared nothing for the continuity of
Hinkie's thoughts.
'â¢Will your Honor," he said, "sit here
and allow me to be insulted in this
manner by counsel to whom I have al
ways extended the utmost courtesy? You
may remain silent; I will not. I
will resent here or elsewhere such false,
vile and undignified reflections on my
character. Surely it is due the dignity of
this court and the profession that such
vile slanders shall not be allowed to
go unanswered and unrebuked. I pro
test against this infamous insinuation on
benalf of the defendant, and as for myself
I will answer it in due and at the proper
time."
Hinkle made an attempt to justify his
conduct by declaring he was proceeding
according to the record. Toe argument
was concluded without further incident.
Court adjourned on til 9:30 this morning,
when Mr. Shortridge will deliver his ar
gument in behalf of Mr. Marriott, after
which Eabn will close for Hebbard and
the case go to the jury.

WEDDING BELLS
RING JOYFULLY
Nuptials of Miss Whitelaw
and Mr. Walter N.
Brunt.
Made One at the Altar of the
First Congregational
Church.
Judge Seawell Officiates at too Wed
ding of Miss Agnes Smedberg
and Max Rosenfe.d
It seemed as if all the hothouses of this
City bad yielded up their fairest blossoms
to decorate the altar of the First Congre
gational Church last evening for the
nuptials of Miss Margaret E. Whitelaw
and Walter N. Brunt. Choicest roses â
the La France and delicate bridesmaidâ
and delicate sweet peas, tinted like the
sea shell, mingied in artistic confusion
with feathery ferns and stately palms.
Potted plants lined the corridors, the en
tire effect lending to the edifice a tinge of
joy and happiness.
Long before the hour announced for the
ceremony the church was crowded to the
doors by an interested audience, all well
wishers of the fortunate young couple.
Since the announcement of the engage
ment of Miss Whitelaw and Mr. Brunt
their many friends here have anxiously
anticipated the happy event of last night.
The bride, who is the daughter of Cap
tain T. P. ri. Whitelaw, has, since her
debut in society some few seasons ago,
been a reigning belle in her own particu
lar set, and equally admired for her
beauty, her graciousness and many ac
complishments.
Walter N. Brunt's friends are legion,
and they all testify to bis high moral
standing, his jolly goodfeliowship and
prominent position in the business com
munity. Mr. Brunt is esDecially a well
known fraternal man. He is a prominent
Mviuic Shfiaer, a Knight Templar of the
Golden Gate Commandery, a Native Son
member of Mission Parlor, and also
prominently identified with other organi
zations.
With commendable exactness, promptly
at half past 8 the strains of the wedding
march announced the arrival of the bridal
party. Fir*t came the ushersâ Judge
Kerrigan, William Dixie, Alfred Borlini
and Mr. Mason. Following the ushers
walked the bridesmaids â Miss Bessie
Hawitt and Miss Annie Reed â who in
turn preceded thÂ« maid of honor, Miss
Agnes Marshall. Then came little Miss
Marion Marshall, carrying a silver plate,
on which rested tha wedding ring. The
bride, leaning on the arm of her father,
closed the bridal procession. The groom,

Adams, assisted by Dr. Gibbons of the
First United Presbyterian Church, united
the couple in the holy bonds of wedlock.
The bride was a picture of youthful
loveliness in her exquisite white-brocaded
satin eown. The jupe was made en train,

die over pink silk. BridesmaiJs and maid
of honor carried bouquets of La France
roses. Little Marion Marshall, the ring
bearer, was a pretty picture in her dainty
frock of pink organdie and pinK satin rib
bon.
After the church ceremony, a reception
followed at the house of the bride's pa
rents, 631 Harrison street. The spacious
house was ablaze with lights and beauti
ful with flowers.

lain and many charming bits of bric-a
brac.

The report that the fortune of the late

One of the gratifying features of the

can repay any part of that debt of honor

The story that the dispatches from Gen

le to publish the truth.
THE PREVAILING POWERS.
Greece has asked tfie allied powers of
Europe for mediation in Ler war with the
Turk, and has submitted to them alt her
interests in the terms of peace that are to
be arranged. Nominally the alliance
wbicti is to deal with the problem is com
posed of Austria, France, Germany, Great
Britain, Russia and Italy. Unless all the
portents of the time are deceptive, how
ever, the alliance which will actually de
termine t:.e conditions of peace is that of
Austria, Germany and Kussia. These
seem lo be firmly agreed upon a certain
definite policy, while the others are divided
and will have litile or no weight in the
council which is to fix the course to be
pursued. Â»
In this alliance of the three Emperors
we have what is virtually a revival of the
so-calied "Holy Allianoe," which was
organized in Europe early in the century.
Now, as then, the aim of the contracting
parties is to maintain existing; conditions
in Europe and perpetuate despotism by
sternly repressing every attempt at free
dom wherever it may be made. The iirst
"Holy Alliance" failed utterly, partly be
cause England was at that time under the
control of young and resolute men who
were prepared to go to war rather than to
submit to its domination, and partly be
cause the people of France were then
eager to throw off the Bourbon ycke
which had been imposed upon them after
the fall of Napoleon. The rising spirit of
freedom in Western Europe was then too
strong to be repressed, and almost every
thing which liberalism aimed for at that
time has now become an accomplished
fact.
The new alliance of the Emperors will
make a second attempt to set limits to the
growth of European freedom. It cannot
undertake to restore the Bourbons to
France nor to dismember Italy, but it
does propose to continue the Sultan in
power at Constantinople and to keep the
Greeks and the felavs as divided and sep
arated peoples. The policy which failed
in Italy is to be tried in the Balkan
Peninsula, and the present despotisms are
to be supported against every effort wnich
may be made by the Slavs or the Greeks
to erect themselves into independent na
tionalities.
The new alliance is stronger than the
old. It has larger armies and is more
closely compact than that which made a
vain effort to establish itself in a former
generation. It does not follow, however,
that the Holy Alliance of to-day will be
any more successful in the end than its
predecessor. It triumphs for a moment,
not so much because of its own strength
as because of the temporary weakness of
opposing liberalism. Sooner or later,
however, there will arise in Western Eu
rope men who will not be content to see
the great free peoples of England, France
and Italy made subordinate to the banded
despotisms of Northern and Eastern Eu
rope. When that time comes the Greeks
and all the people of the Balkan Penin
sula will have strong friends to sustain
them in a war for independence, and the
outcome of the new struggle will be widely
different from that which has befallen the
GreeKs to-day.
DELAYED WORK.
An investigation mads by The Call
into the work on the new municipal build
ing disclosed the fact that on Tuesday
there were seven men employed, only
two being engaged in the bricklaying.
The work of construction, therefore, is
virtually stationary. Only enough is
being done to afford a color of justifica
tion for the employment of a superin
tendent of construction and the payment
to him of a salary of $250 a month.
It goes without savins such a condition
of affairs is unjustifiable. That much is
recognized even by those who bave any
authority in the matter, and each of them
when questioned on the subject made ex
cuses for himself by shifting the blame
upon some one else. The contractors
allege the delay is caused by the neglect
of certain property-owners to have the
walls of their property adjoining the site
properly underpinned, while the owners
of the property declare they are most
eager to bave the work of construction go
on, and have not been in any way re
sponsible for the slow progress which has
been made up to this time.
It is the duty of the City government to
see to it that these various excuses are
investigated and their true value deter
mined. Whatever may be the cause of
the delay it should be promptly removed.
There is now in the City treasury an
ample appropriation for the completion
of the building. The contract for the
work has been let and there is a large
number of unemployed men in the City
who are looking for work. It is certain,
therefore, that no valid and sufficient rea
son can exist for letting the construction
drag at the present slow rate.
Tiie delay in the work on the building
is an injury to the City in many ways, it
keeps locked up in the City treasury a
large sum of money which should be put
into circulation. It leaves without work
and wages a large number of men who
ought to have employment. It interferes
with the business of propÂ»rty-owners near
the site, while leaving a large plat of
ground vacant and idle. Moreover, it en
tails the monthly payment of a salary of
$250 to a superintendent of construction
who has nothing to do except to watch a
few men shovel earth and two men lay
brick.
The Call does not undertake to decide
who is to blame in the matter. It is suffi
cient to point out that there must bs
blame somewhere, and to call the atten
tion of the authorities and 01 the people
to the fact. The longer the construction
of the work is delayed, the greater will bs
the cost, and it is bsd business both for
the City and for the property-owners in
the neighborhood of the proposed build
ing to permit the construction to lag in
the way it has done for some time past.
POETIO JUSTICE.
It is reported from Washington that
Secretary Gage intends to perform an act
of poetic justice by replacing in the Phila
delphia Mint some thirty veterans of the
war who were dismissed from their posi
tions by the Cleveland administration.
An investigation has shown that the
veterans were removed on Decoration day
four years ago, and Mr. Gage will replace
tuem on the coming Decoration day. ThÂ«
justice of their reinstatement will there
fore have the element of poetic retribu
tion by taking place on what will be not
only the anniversary of their removal, but
the day set apart as a solemn festival
for the commemoration of the services to
the Republic of that grand army of which
they are members.
The reinstatement of these veterans
will be gratifying to all patriots through
out the country. No feature of the Cleve
land administration gave more offense to
public sentiment than did those acts
which disclosed a hostility to the veterans
of the war simply because they were vet
erans. The country noted with profound
indignation the removal of competent
officials from office by the Democratic ad
ministration, against whom no charge of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 13, 1897.
misconduct or inefficiency could be
brought.
Had these removals been made frankly,
under the spoils system of turning oat
Republicans to make way for Democrats,
the people would hare regarded it with
less hostility. Cleveland, however, made
such loud claims as a civil-service re
former, and f-o ostentatiously posed as an
opponent of the spoils system, that no
conclusion was possible except that these
removals were made simply because the
men were grand army veterans snd had
taken a patriot's part in ihe war to which
Cleveland had sent a substitute.
, The people of the United States recog
nize the full value of the debt which they
owe to the grand army of the Republic.
They take priae in showing their grati
tude and loyalty to the brave men who
defended the Union in its hour of danger
and preserved it from those who sought
to destroy it. They gladly avail the m
selves of every opportunity to do honor
to the veterans. They favor liberal pen
si >ns to all who need them, and are glad

THE WEONG WAT.
In commenting upon the pood results
accomplished by the united efforts of the
commercial and industrial bodies of the
City to bring about the speedy beginning
of the work of construction on the new
Federal building The Call has frequently
pointed cut that this umty of effort is the
right way to achieve success. The Ex
aminer of yesterday offered an illustration
of the wrong way, which is worth study
ing as a contrast to the course advocated
and adopted by The Call.
The Examiner beaded its editorial "Our
Elusive Postcfnce" and went on to say:
"The news from Washington is not of a
kind to encourage San Francisco with the
belief that its new Postofnce building will
be on view in the near future." To main
tain this statement it argued that as the
Government is hard up for money and the
current deficit iÂ» liKely to be about $33,000,
--000 it would be the policy of the adminis
tration not to undertake any work of
public improvement It concluded with
the assertion: "If the San Francisco Post
office is to be eicepted Irom this policy it
will require a good deal of smooth talking
and a very liberal use of Congressional
shoe leather about the Treasury Depart
ment."
It goes without saying that if the senti
ment of the Examiner finds much sym
pathy among the people of San Francisco
the prophecy of no wors on the Postofnce
building will accomplish itself. If we
make up our minds 'hat we are not to
have the building it is certain we will not
gel it. If we decide that the notice to quit
served to tenants on the site of the pro
posed structure means nothing and that
the promises of the officials at Washing
ton to let contracts for the work in time
to begin early in the coming fiscal year
are valueless, then it is quite likely that
those officials will feel no particular in
terest in the work and will accommodate
themselves to our indifference by being
equally indifferent and permitting the
wnoie thing to go over for another year.
Fortunately the people do not share the
sentiments of the Examiner, and are not
likely to adopt its tone of cynical disbelief
in the promises made at Washington, nor
its policy of haif-hidden opposition to the
enterprise. Under the lead of The Call
some of the most influential associations
of the City have engaged vigorously in
the task of urging on the work of con
structing the building, and they have
abundant reasons for confidence in the
promises that have been made by the
Washington officials. They are aware
that much has already been achieved by
their united efforts, and have assurances
that if an equal energy and harmony
among the people of San Francisco con
tinue to be manliest we shall see those
promises fulfilled and the work on the
building begun early in the coming sum
mer.
Too much has been already gained by
the right way of dealing with this prob
lem for any considerable number of people
to be tempted to turn again to the wrone
way. Despite the forebodings of the Ex
aminer the outlook is encouraging. We
shall see the work of construction begun
before long, and all that will be left for
the Ezami ntr to do will be to carp, criti
cize, condemn and whine that the build
ing is being put up in the wrong place,
that the work is being done in the wronz
way, and that it won't be much of a build
ing anyhow.

AROUND IhE CORRIDORS.
"I was in the famine districts of India re
peatedly," said Dr. J. H. Barrows, president of
the Parliament of Religions at the Chicago
Exposition, at the Palace yesterday, who has
just returned from India. "What I saw tillod
me with sadness, the scenes were so narrow-
"European residents have their homes out
side most Indian cities, and in almost all our
explorations of the native bazaars we drive a
considerable distance through English can
tonments, by the side of tho bungalows in
habited by missionaries and civil and military
officers, before we reach the town. Delhi, al- >
though it has a population of nearly 200,000,
and, although its bazaars are rich with
enameled jewelry, exquisite miniatures, en
graved gems, cashmere shawls, embroideries,
potteries and carved ivory, has the usual
squalid look of Indian cities.
"As I sat On the marble dais where all this
splendor once gleamed, and summoned before
my imagination the gorgeous scenes on which
the proud Emperor gasea, and ss I thought ot
the Persian inscription on the north and south
arcbes of the hallâ
If on earth 1)0 an EdÂ«n of bliss,
It is this, it is this, none but this,
I felt anew not only the transitoriness, but
the moral unworthlness, of the glories which
were made possible by the spoliation of mil
lions and by the practical enslavement of a
wnole people. There is no reason to believe
that the condition of the Indian nations was
better in the time of Bhab. Jehan than in the
time of the Queen-Empress Victoria. Indeed,
it must have b<*en far worse. There are native
patriots to-day who imagine that the 'simple
life of India 1 is preferable to the 'luxurious
and enervating civilization' of tho west. I
have even been asked if I would like to live
tac 'simpio life of India.' II by this expres
sion is meant tbe half-clothed distress, the
pitiful hunger of the many millions who, not
merely in years of famine, but generally, live
in mud hovels without the comiorts that are
enjoyed by some of the aboriginal tribes of
North America, I should neither like it for
myself nor for the poorest and most abject peo
ple of Europe.
"One feels almost hopeless for a people living
in such material conditions. Of course, the
general distress is aggravated in this year of
plague and famine. Thousands we are told,
have died of hunger. The British Government
was altogether too slow in bringing relief, and
it seems that it was finally almost driven to
take decisive action by the indignantelamors
of those who would Dot disbelieve what their
own eyes saw. I myself have seen pitiful
wretches, lean and haggard, gathered at the
Etations. I have been told ot deaths from
famine by those who know the special circum
stances. lam credibly informed that mothers
have offered to sell their children for onogood
meal. Tbe camera does not lie, and I send
pictures of some of the subjects of the British
Empire taken in December at Jnbbulpore,

the English people from aiding the sufferers

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Alice Nielsen, formerly of theTivoli, who has
made such a hit witn the Bostoniuns in "The
Serenade," has made up her mind to go to
Paris and study seriously for opera comique,
probably with Mmc. Marches!. Her success as
Yvonne, in "The Serenade," has been so great
that it is refreshing to find that her pretty little
head hos not been at all turned by all the praise
the critics have given her in New York. In an
interview published in the Concert Goer, Alice
Nielseusays: "I know my voice is not yet
perfectly placed, and I am going to work at it
till I get it right. I shall not do as tome foolish
American girls do when they go to Paris, and
give myself up to having a 'good time,'
frequenting balls, caios, and such reprehensi
ble things. I shall buckle right down to hard,
systematic work, studying my voice, taking
lessons in diction, in fencing and all other
branches which enter into a thorough train
ing for the stage. My only dissipation will be
going to tlve operas. I confess to being ambi

tious. I want to be able to take a position in
the upper circles of opera comique, to sing
such parts as Zerllna, in 'Fra Diavolo' and
'Don Giovanni' ; Marie, in 'La Fille dv Regi
ment,' and Rosina, in 'II Barbiere.' "
Any one who was present on the opening
nieht of "The Serenade" in New York will en
oy a reminiscent smile on seeing Alice Niel
sen in the trim little suit of Knickerbockers
here disclosed, for it was this very costume
which caused the heartiest of all hearty
laughs on that auspicious occasion. It hap
pened thus: Jessie Bartlett Davis, who is not
as slender as a reed, is on the convent side of
the'vrall, and Alice Nielsen on the monastery
side. The former climbing tip a ladder and
looking over the barrier discovers the latter.
They parley, and Miss Davis, dressed as a girl,
proposes, the better to further her schemes, an
exchange of garments, whereat a loud guffaw
broke out in the audience as a vivid picture 01
the results of the plan flashed over their men
tal vision. Since then there has been a differ
ent adjustment of garments.
A great many people scoff at the Shakes
pearean doctrine mat "music Lath charms to
sooth the savage breast," but however true it
may b^e of the savage breast, music certainly
seems to have charms to soothe the civilized
breast when it is ruffled by patriotism. For
some time past, musical prophets have been
predicting that if anything could make France
and Germany love one another it would be the
mutual love of music, and current events
seem to be fulfilling the prophecy. It is not
very long since French painters were bitterly
accused of unpatrlotism when they talked of
exhibiting in German galleries, and many
actors and actresses, inclndlng Sarah Bern
hardt, refuse o;i the score of patriotism to act
"across the Rhine," at they Bay in France.
Music, however, especially a mutual Wagner
worship, Is rapidly changing all that. Not
long ago Felix Mottl's orchestra, "from across
the Rhine," was rapturously received in Paris,
and as au exchange of compliments the Pa
risian Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by
Edward Colonne, has been rapturously re
ceived in Berlin. A correspondent says: "A
wreath tied with the French colors was ten
dered Monsieur Colonne, and he was recalled
five times."
What would they have said in Paris before
the Wagner cult began to a French conductor
oelng tendered a wreath "tied with the French
colors" in Berlin ?
Mine. Ksirella Beliniante, the blind con

cale at the Wh ite House, which took place on
the sth inst. The Washington Times gives
the following account of the affair:
"In the programme of last evening, which
was principally selected by Mrs. McKinley,

and 'In Cuerpo Ytu Alma,* by her accom
panist, Sig. a. Giannini, the well-known com
poser, who came over from New York for the
evening.
"In response to the request of the President
the charming English ballad, 'Daddy,' by
Behrend, was given. It is seldom that Amer
icans show the enthusiasm which was mani
fested last evening. The audience was com
pletely carried away with the singer, recall
ing her again and again.
"The President and Mrs. McKinley welcomed
their gueÃts in the blue room, which was dec
orated with growing plants only.
"Mra. McKinley was gowned in a handsome
broende of s'asheU pink, with diamond orna
ments."
Legrand Hawlar.d. a young American com
poser, has hit upon a very successful way of
bringing his two-act opera to the attention of
the public. Despairing at the difficulty of se
curing recognition at home, he managed to
interest the American and English colonies in
Paris in the work, which he called "Nita,"
and under the patronage of these two colo
nies, and a number of other foreigners resi
dent in Paris, the overture and me first act of
"Nita" were recently given one hearing at the
Nouveau Theater. So great was the success
obtained by these fragments that it has Deen
decided to give the young American's opera,
ballet and all, in Paris at the end of the pres
ent monih. The French critics speak in the
highest terms of "Nita."

Letters received from London by friends of

to open toward the end of May with what the
colonel calls his "American company, with
three star prima donnas added, who must be

At a grand "at home" recently given by
Marquis Guerrieri-Gouzaga at Mantua, Italy,
Mascagni entertained the guests by playing a
number of selections irom the new Japanese
opera that he is writing, and which he has
already named "Iride." Every one expressed
great delight at the music, which is said to be
in Mascagm's best veiu; but great surprise
was expressed that the Italian composer has
not departed at all from his Italian style of
writing. There are no attempts at Japanese
coloring in the music; indeed it is probable
that Mascagni has never heard either a Jap
anese or a Chinese band, and knows nothing
about the music of the far Orient. If he does
he has carefully kept his knowledge out of
"Iride."
The French Chauvinists have been wailing
and gnashing their teeth over the fact that,
in order to please Tamagno, Verdi's
"Cello" bas been given in Italian at the
Paris Grand Opera. 'â¢Wuat," they cried, "sing
in a foreign language in our national the
aterâa theater endowea by tne French Gov
ernment and supported out of the pockets of
the FreDch taxpayers?" In spite of this
profanation of the national theater by a for
eign toneue 'Otello" has made a furor at
the Grand Opera, and Tamagno is the operatic
hero of the hour in Paris.

he is facetiously called, is at'wiesbaaen taking

At the recently held session of the Grand
Parlor of the Native Sons of the Golden West,
Pacific Parlor No. 10 succeeded in capturing
two choice prizes. These were the election of
two of its members to two of the highest offices

Three Men on the Steamer

Another opium-smuggling scheme was
revealed yesterday afternoon when the
steamer Australia docked at racinc-stieet
wharf. Three of the steward's depart
ment were arrested in Honolulu for at
tempting to land 100 tins of the drug
amone bundles of the dirty clothes. The
opium was secured but the wrong men
were arrested.

meda, and H. Peters and T. O'Brien were
put in jail, but all were released when
the facts of the case were placed before
the court.
It appears that th 9 information fur
nished the Hawaiian authorities was given
by Captain Howard of the OceaDic dock
in this City. One of the waiters named
Tom Darrell, while taking twenty tins of
opium aboard, was arrested by tke Cus
tom-house officers. The drug was found
to be legally in the United States and
nothing could be done in the matter.
How many more "tins" were aboard,
however, nobody knew, so Captain How
ard issued his orders accordingly.
The Australia was hardly tied up at the
wharf in Honolulu before Chief Steward
Joseph Seeley was ashore and had in
formed the customs authorities that the
supposition was that there was opium in
the steerage. A thorough search was
made, bat nothing could be found. When
the dir y clothes came to be packed,
young Peters, who was making his lirst
trip, was on the detail while , O'Brien
handled the packages in which the opium
was found. Barry had general supervi
sion of the whole matter, and his chief had
such confidence in his men t jat he at once
put up $500 cash bail for them. When
remonstrated with in regard to the risk
he was running, Chief Steward Seeley
said: "I will always take the pan of my
boys even if Ido run a ri*k." The result
was that his confidence was proved well
founded as the charges against them all
were dismissed. The real culprits will be
ferreted out before the Australia leaves
port again.
Only two wreaths came up on the
steamer this trip and they were consigned
to the furnace by Inspector of Horticul
ture Craw.
One of the moit luscious Herat among
the cargo was a consignment of water
melons to Vanvales & Co. Every negro
on the water front was around that pile,
and before they could be loaded into a
wagon two of those melons mysteriously
disappeared.
The' least said about the yellow fever
scare on the City of Sydney is "soonest
mended." A man lost four razors on the
trip up from Panama and vowed to get
even because the company would not pay
for them. Next seen he was asking all
the Custom-houss officers on the Mail
dock to point him out a reporter. He
finally found an amateur from the Ex
aminer. "Rot, pure rot," is all Captain
Frank Johnson of the City of Sydney will
say.

ins to order, submitted the following
names to be added to the committee, which
were passed : F. G. Arsrall, A. F. Chambers,
WelJesleyMoore, Thomas Jfrice and Joseph

Communications were read from the
Caledonian Club and Cambrian Mutual
Aid Society of this City and St. Andrew's
Societyof Oakland, expressing their hearty

SAVED THE BOY'S LIFE.
Mounted Patrolman H. C. Smith
Stopped a Runaway on Van
Ness Avenue.
H. G. Smith, a mounted patrolman on
Van Ness avenue, distinguished himself
yesterday by saving the life of Arthur
Fitzgerald, a nine-year-old lad, the son of
a locksmith at 45 Eleventh street.
The little fellow was driving a spirited
horse attached to ft two- wheeled cart
belonging to his father down Van Ness
avenue toward Market street. At the
corner of Grove street, where the officer
sat on his horse, the boy lost control of
his animal and a runaway was imminent.
Finally tne lad fell headlong over the
dashboard and became tangled in the
harness and shafts. TÂ»e few feet he was
dragged along the pavement before Officer
Smith reached and stopped the runaway
were not sufficient to dash his brains out.
Aa it was, all the flesh on the back of both
hands was torn off, leaving the bones
bare.
The boy was extricated from his perilous
position and carried to the Receiving
Hospital, where he bravely stood the
treatment of his wounds, refusing to take
an anesthetic.
Advances made on furniture and pianos with
or without removal. Noouau, 1017-1073 Mission.
Swallowed Morphine.
Louis Boom, a man out of work and despon
dent, swallowed a dose of morphine in the

He was :nKonto tne Receiving Hospital and

THE CORN WAS
FULL OF PINS
Remarkable Experience of
A. R. Kanaga, the
Attorney.
His Mouth Felt as Though He
Had Tried to Masticate
a Hedgehog.
Applies to the Courts to See if the
Peddler Who Sold the Stuff
Cannot B: Punhbei.
Lawyer Kanaga visited the Cliff House
last Sunday with his little daughter, to
see the sights and let the child hear the
mournful roaring of the giant seals. On
the way back to the cars a wagon full of
tempting-looking popcorn bars caught the
eye of his offspring and she was not satis
fied until her father purchased a couple.
The invigorating sea air and the beauty
of the scene made Mr. Kanaga feel like a
boy again, and ne gayly took a bite oat of
the bar that he held in bis hand. A sharp
pain in the roof of his mutitn caused him
to expectorate the corn even more rapidly
than he had bitten it, and an investiga
tion of the severed piece revealed a pin
sticking out of the corn.
Supposing that this was all he took a
second bite, though with more caution;
there was another shock and a second pin
was unearthed. Then Mr. Kanaga de
cided to investigate and tore the bar to
fragments, after admonishing bis daugh
ter not to cut hers until he was through
with his investigation. No less than eight
healthy sized pins came from among the
corn kernels and the attorney carefully
preserved them. Several pins were also
found in his daughter's bar of corn.
Now he wants to know whether the
man who made hi 3 mouth feel as though
he had bitten a hedgehog cannot be pun
ished for something or other. He claims
that the man woo sold the corn is a ped
dler named Davis, living at 148 Ninth
street, and is divided between having him
arrested for peddling without a license,
malicious mischief or selling food deleteri
ous to health.
He called on Assistant Prosecuting At
torney John T. Hogan of the Police Court
yesterday, and asked what course he
could pursue to punish the peddler for
bis own hurts and the danger in which
his daughter had been placed.
The representative of the Ciiy could not
say offhand just what heading ihe matter
should come'under, but there is evidently
trouble in store for the peddler.
STENOGRAPHERS' PAY.
Supervisor* Believe XhÂ»t Those of the
Police Courts Receive Too Much.
Expert Newman of the Finance Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors was
engaeed yesterday in gathering figures lor
the Supervisors on the expense to the
City of tue stenographers of the Police
courts. The committee has found that
the employes mentioned receive under the
present method of payiag them from $300
to $500 per month.
The membeis believe that this compen
sation is out of all proportion to the ser
vices performed, and that good men will
take the places at salaries not exceeding
$150 per month each. They will try to
iind soms way to make a chanse.
TOW TO-DAT.
"WhatT"
too poor to buy Pure Food ?
If your food is pure, you
don't have to use so much.
For example : if you have
been paying 5 or 10 cents for
a 2-oz. bottle of extracts, Schil-
ling's Best 2-oz. bottle contains
40 times as much flavor (and
better) as the extracts you
have been buying.
If your cheap extracts are
worth sor 10 cents, Schilling's
Best is worth 62 or $4; but
Schilling's Best is only 25 cents.
Try Schilling's Best â your
money back if you don't agree
with â at your grocer's.

rainfall, of melira snow in inches and liundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect po.'n s of equal air pressure; iao

word "hieh" means lilsh barometric pressure aud
!s usually accomcanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied br cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on tbe Washington
roast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along tbe coatt, rain Is probable:
but when the "low Is inclosed with isobars of
niarked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in tbe vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
wetther may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

â¢ NEW TOKK MARKETS.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 12 -In to-day's stock
market those shares that were not objects of ag
gressive selling for "short" account made, as a
rule, fractional gains, while two of the most active
features of the market, Chicago Gas and Sugar Re
fining, though subjected to continuous and heavy
pressure throughout, scored net losses of less than
1 per cent. Sugar Refining, the most active
feature of the market, closed % per cent lower
than yesterday on transactions exceeding 25.000
shares. Washington dispatches indicating the im
probability of the acceptance by the .Senate of
the full measure of protection accorded sugar In
the tariff schedules of the finance sub-committee
explained the decline. In the railway list the only
two stocks in which transactions attained a total
of 10,000 shares were St. Paul and Union Pacific.
The latter was a conspicuous figure in the railway
lilt, advanclnâ¢ on purchases chiefly for foreign ac
count, and closing with a net gain of 1 per cent,
Foreign purchases o:sewbere in tbe market rave a
firm tone to early dealings. The favorable In
'flnence in local trading was the removal of un
founded apprehensions regarding the heavy gold

YESTERDAY'S WHEAT MAKKET.
The following resume of the wheat market is
furnished by K. A. Bresse, Produce Exchange
grainbroker, 412 Pine street. . -
San Kbancisco, May 12, 1897.
Chicago.
Early cables strong. The market opened steady.
First trades in July were 73Vfac to 733/Â»c Offer
~ ings light, causing a firm feeling. Prices held
around opening quotations for the first ten min
ute* The Illinois State crop report became known,
showing a very critical condition of wheat through
out thÂ« State. One million nine hundred thou
sand acres were sown to wheat this spring; there
remains now but 500,000 acres, tbe balance hav
ing been plowed up and put to other use. .
The condition of the 600,000 acres now bearing
wheat is 51 percent. There will hardly be enougn
wheat harvested in Illinois to fill the require
ments for seeding. On this report prices ad
vanced, Offering's were very light until the
market had advanced to 74VsC tor July.
.At this price enough lone wheat came out to
supply the demand*. Selling fcecame rather gen*
eral as the last hour drew to a close. Realizing
sales started shorts to raiding. be market broke
jy-.se from the top, regaining Vi at the close.
Outside news during the day was mvorai.le to the
long side of wheat.
Crop conditions in France reported â  improving
slowly. Hungary's crop is suffering from ex ess
ive rains. English crop conditions continue far
from satisfactory. Warm weather is urgently
needed in order to secure at best only a moderate
crop. Cash wheat was in good demand. Interior
ml lers bought liberally. - .
Exporters more willing to meet demands of
sellers St. Louis reported an excellent demand
for spot. Buyers were paying from 1 to 3 cents
over market quotations in order to supply their
wants. -â  ... â :.â¢: / -.. .' â  â¢:â  â :.
New Orleans wired 90,000 bushels wheat taken
for direct export to-day. * Closing Liverpool cables
y 3 d higher, showing an advance of Id for the day
corn was less active than yesterday. Weatber
conditions gave the shorts less uneasiness. Trad
i tic while of a larger volume than usual, was not of
sufficient magnitude .to change â Â« prices much.
Western cribbers are not disposed to sell at pres
ent prices, preferring 10 . await results in regard to
the new crops. Exports are very large and stocks
are rapidly disappearing.
I -.Oats kept wi;hin a narrow range, scalpers doing
the bu kof trading. ;
â Provisions - neglected. Heavier receipts of hogs
continue to keep prices depressed. ;
Sao Francisco.
9:16 A. x. session.
- Stronger cables, together with an advance of 1
cent in Chicago wheat as compared with yester
day's close, did not have the effect of advancing
the local market. fS9B!|w^Bwo(SÂ»9Saas*tsiaS*
Cloudy weather offset all other favorable con
dition*.. December wheat opened at 81 2714, ad
vanced to 91 27% under heavy selling and de
clined to $1 266/g. Shorts seemed more secure in
their position and offering* were heavier than for
several days past. <â :â â ' â â¢'â¢â  - â - x â  . >â --â ; - â¢

weather condl ions. May wheat sold at 91 35%,
and 91 :-.:>.'. was bid at the close. " :
Barley received no attention.
' 10:16 a. m. session.
The disposition in whea; was weak. Cloudy
weather acted as a damper to bull enthusiasm.
December opened at $1 2b% and declined to
$1 26%.. Nothing was done iv May.
Barley has few friends. December sold off to
7414 cas in wheat, weather conditions were
against higher prices. Trading during the session
was of a tamer character. Traders seemed un
willing to venture one wav or the other: those in
the market stood, by their guns. The weakness
displayed in Chicago rather encouraged shorts,
yet they did not appear aggressive. .
11:16 a. m. session.
The wheat pit at the opening of the session
seemed to be a regular crazy-house. Jus. be
fore the session opened December wheat was of
fered at 91 263,4,
At the opening sentiment was materially
changed. J-uyers were plenty, offerings light.
The demand for wheat quickly sent December
from 91 -.7 to $1 28. The volume of trading was
the largest during any session for many months.
Buying was of â  good character.
Private loreign advices had much to do with
shaping prices. Aggressiveness of the bears was
remarkable; they fought hard to keep prides
down, but their efforts met with very little suc
cess. December closed strong at 91 28.
December barley sold at 75%e. against 74% c;
at the previous session May sold at 75c.
2 p. M. skssion.
December wheat ooened at $1 28, where the
greater part of trading was done, a few sales at
*1 27% being the only change during the session.
Ihe voiun of b.isUK-s-i was arge. and. while the
range amounted to only i/g c . the amount of trad
ing was fuily as large as at any time when the
range was from ie to . c.
Around 9128 the shorts seemed determined to
make a ligiit, and were putting out new lines. The
market has advanced 22c. Under ordinary con
dtlious such an advance would invite shor; selling
and unloading of long wheat. Holders were not
disposed, however, to sell even at the advance,
believing in much higher prices in the near future.
Barley was in fair demand, with prices showing
an advancing tendency. December sold early in .
the session at 75% c and closed at 76c

DEMAND RELIEF
Will Give the Clark Road
Law a Practical
Test.
Every Road District in the State
Is Interested in the
Result.
Very Much Dissatisfied With What
They Term Incompetent and
Partial Work
Oaki.anj) OrncE Pan Francisco Call,l_
908 Broadway, May 12. \"
The residents of Piedmont are so thor
oughly dissatisfied wiih the coudition of
their roads and the manner in which they
are being handled tnat they havo decided
to make a test of the Clark road law â
first cs to its legality and then, if success
ful, as to its practicability.
The opinion of Senator Stratton that
the Clark law is perfectly constitutional
has encouraged the taxpayers to try to
take the matter of their roads into their
own hands. They have named candidates
for the offices of Road Trustees, as re
quired by the act, aud a petition has been
circulated for signatures of those agreea
ble to the movement.
The petition was signed by ninety tax
payers in less than ti ve hours, and would
have been sinned by as many more had it
been deemed necessary. According to
the opinion of Senator Siratton, the
County Board of Supervisors should be
the first body to approve of the nominees
of the district for Trustees, and a petition
was presented to them last Monday.
As the operation of the law would de
prive Supervisors ot much patronage in
road niatier.-. that body did not see fit to
accord the petition mucu notice, and Su
pervisor Wells made a motion that the
matter be indefinitely postponed. Wells
has nine road districts in his supervisor
ial district. Supervisor Talcott called at
tention to the fact that such action was
not right or in the line of fair play. He
BaiJ they were there not to dictate to the
taxpayers, but to deliberate in a respect
ful manner on the expressed desire of any
or ail of the citizens of all road districts
in the county. The matter was eventu
ally temporarily laid over by mutual con
sent.
'I ne residents of Piedmont declare that
their roads are at present in the hands of
incompetent overseer?, nni that the road
work is being done in a selfish and ptirtiai
manner by Su; ervisor lloeth, wno is him
neif a property owner in the district.
They declare that sections of road 3 through
unimproved property have been opened
and macadam. z d, while other sections of
roads which are frequently traveled over
have been neglected. Under the circum
stances, they declare that they are better
able to look after their own streets than
others who are not working solely for the
taxpayers' interests. They intend to push
tne matter to a conclusion, and, if neces
sary, mandamus the Supervisors to ac
knowledge their position and counte
nance their petition.
NO HEADS DKOPPED.
Fire and Police < omtnisslonert Do Xot
Produce a Sensation.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 12â There was
some checker-board policy at the meeting
of the Board of Works this morning, at
which somebody was checkmated, but it
is not quite clear who would have won ia
case a victory had been scored.
For several weeks a plan has been on
foot to change the heads of the Street and
Fire departments. It has been, customary
for successive Boards of Works to make
these changes. But, although in office a
month and a half, nothing hns yet been
disturbed except the Health Department;
consequently it i- generally understood
that tne ax is in the air and may descend
at any moment.
This morning City Engineer Clement
introduced a resolution declaring vacant
the office of Chief of the Fire Department.
Mayor Thomas declined to vote, City At
torney Dow voted uo and the motion was
lost.
Clement then presented another resolu
tion, declaring vacant the position of as
sistant chief. Thoma3 and Dow voted no,
and this was also lost.
At another meeting later on Mr. Clem
ent voted to declare vacant the Street Su
perintendent's position and his deputy.
Mayor Thomas was not ready to vote, and
Clement and Dow voted one each way, so
the attempt was futile. Mr. Clement is
the only Democrat on the board, and is
anxious to reward his Iriends, but as all
the men in office are Republicans the task
is not easy.

OAKLAND, Cal., May 12.â Attorney

FLEET STANFORD HORSES
Palo Alto Raiicho Again to See
Many Youngsters Triggpd

HorsvÃrerding &ai Dvaloping to Be
ccme a Regular Eusij. ssâ Going
en the California Circuit
Frank K. Merritt, for five years pest
superintendent of Henry J. Crocker's Los
Aguajes rancho of 8000 acres near Clover
dale, is in the City on his way to Palo
Alto, where he is to take the snperinten
dency of -the great Stanford or Palo Aito
rÂ«nch of 2800 acres. He is only eoing
down now to get the run of thing?, but he
will commence actively as superintendent
on June 1.
There are a lot of things in view in refer
ence to the great ranch, and especially in
regard to the raising and developing of
horses. Before Senator Stanford died he
nad accumulated over 1000 head ot horses,
of d.fferent ages, on tne Palo Alto ranch.
The babies and youngster* were trained

PART OF THE PROGRAMME AT THE DOG SHOW.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 12 âThe dog show opened this afternoon and tne
attendance was good for the first day. The exhibition is certainly the best ever
held in this city. In addition to tbe many high-bred dogs, there are a large num
ber of special exhibits. Dr. Selfridge has three pets in one cage; one is a fox who
keeps company in the kennel with a Newfoundland pup and a Maltese cat, and
they have never yet been Known to quarrel. Another interesting exhibit is a
beautiful cat called "Lady Tatters." With her are some daughters, giandchildren
and great-grandchildren, and all are beautiful specimens of the Angora feline.
Leon, a beautiful Angora cat, said to be the champion cat in this country, ia
also on show, and all are owned by G. A. Mudgett of Fruitvale. Every kind of
doe, from the size of a rat to tiie size of a pony, is to be lound in the kennels, and
there are also Trick dogs, who give a performance each evening.
half-grown they could clip off a gait that
wouid perfectly astonish a stranger. After
the Senator passed away all this was
changed. The great majority of the horses
were sold, and others were shipped off to
the Vina rancho.
Now this i 3 all changed, as Mr. Merrilt
explains. The comparatively few horses
lÂ»ft on the Palo Alto ranch have increased
till there are over 500 head. These horses
and others are to be taken in hand.
"There are about sixty head at Vina
trm will also be brought" down," said Mr. !
Merritt. "One car was broueht down to- :
day. All these will be added to the 500 '
and more that are at Palo Aito, and the \
Dorset will begin to undergo a thorough i
course of training, so as to develop them. j
There are horses there 3 years old that i
have been handled but very little. The
idea is to not only develop tne horses now '
there, but to raise horses right along.
"It has been found, despite the low
price of hor-es, that there is yet good
money in good driving and well-mated
teams, as well as roadsters, and wo will
furnish them whenever we find we have
got such horses. Of course the ranch will
endeavor to produce as many star horses
as possible, such as will win out on the j
track, despite the vast competition. All j
this is according to Mr. Lathrop's idea. |
We have got quite a string of youngsters
and other.-, twenty-live at least, that will
be put on the California circuit, and will
appear at Stockton, Marysville, Los !
Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento and j
other places.
"A good deal more grain and hay will
be grown at Palo Alto in order to support
the horses. The orchards tnere are |
leased out. The vineyards the estate '
rana. I think there are about '.'.OO acre* of \
the grapes, and ttien there is inÂ« winery. I
Of coarse the Palo Alto ranch, as well a* |
the Vina and Gridley, consisting of 53,000
acres more, belong to the university, and
the object is to make as much money out
of them as possible."

University.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 12 -At tha '
comraencemont exercises of the State j
University this afternoon decrees were j
issued to 200 students. They ran from the j
highest graduate degree, that of Doctor o! â 
Philosophy, down throuj;!i three of the (
affiliated professional co!leses ;o the low- j
est academic degree granted by the insti- j
tution. From the undei{:raduate depart
ment at Berkeley alone 151 diplomas were j
granted, which were twenty more than j

nnder the head of graduate and of profes- \
sional. From the law college thirty-six

Elston of Woodland, was awarded the j
regents' goli medal for the highest rank- :
ing in scholarship. A cold medal was also
granted to Charles F. Keane by the faculty
of the college of veterinary surgery for
distinguished work.
Elston's achievement in carrying off the
golden reward of labor from a ciass of 15L
is looked upon as a remarkable one, in
view of the amount of work he has done
outside the classroom during his college |
career.
The exercises, which began at 2:30, were
long and tedious, and the immense, poorly
managed crowd was restless and noisy.
The old gymnasium, which accommo
dates about 1500 people, was hlled to over
flowing, many visitors having turned
away.

ONE-ARM CHARLEY
IS AMNESTIED
Cordial Relations Renewed
With the Railroad
Company.
A Letter From Mr. Fillmore
That Affects Hundreds of
t trikers.
Harmony Effected in the Interest of
Building Up and Developing
Oakland.
Oakland Office San Francisco Calt,,)
90S Broadway, May U. f
Charley Hall, the Paul Revere of the
celebrated railroad strike of 1894, will soon
be operating the signals of the Southern
Pacilic Company again after keing away
from such work lor nearly three year.*.
Hall is a one-armed man and was one of
ihe most active and prominent among the
strikers. His name has been on the dis
charged list for ail that time, and now
through a correspondence between Coun
ci.man Cuyellier of West Oakland, where
Hall lives, and Superintendent Fillmore,
an amnesty has been granted of a more
radical nature than anything that has yet
emanated from the railroad office.
Mr. Cuvellier's letter and the reply from
Mr. Fillmore show very clearly that there
is no desire on the part of the railroad to
harbor malice against any of its ex
employes, and that Charley Hall does not
feel toward the company as he once did.
The letter of Councilman Cuveliier is as
follows:
Oakland, April 30, 1897.
A. D. Wilder, Division Superintendent (south
ern Pacific Company, Oak â Dear bits: Char
lie Hall having signified to me vis intention
ot applying i" iiave his name removed from
i lie discharged list, and also his desire to re
turn, If possible, to the service of the Southern
Pacific Company, I make free to express the
nope that you win give his request your ear
nest consideration and that you may conclude
to recommend favorable action in the matter.
Without presuming to make any suggestions
to the company in the matter of its relations
to the strikers of 1894, 1 cannot help but think
mat if the Southern Pacific Company would
declare a geueral amnesty to all the strikers
(excepting, possibly, those who actually de
stroyed property or assaulted the men who
took their places), and as the opportunity
might present Itself, allow thorn to return
to work, tne people oi Oakland as a commun
ity would bear such action in grateful remem
brance and it would doubtless tend very much
to the bringing about of a batter feeling be
tween our citizens and your oration, so
that apart from our eoi.flic;ing property inter
ests, which must be settled by the courts, we
could ail work harmoniously together for the
development and building up of Oakland into
the great city which it should be by right of
it* location and surroundings. Vorv truly
yours, B. C. CrvEi.nEÃ,
Councilman at Large.
The reply from Superintendent Fillmore
to Superintendent Wilder reads as fol
lows:
San Francisco, May 7, 1897.
A. D. Wilder, Superintendent Oakland Pierâ
Dear Sir: I nave your fnvurot the 4.h mat.,
with letter from B. C. Cuvellter, also one from
W. VV. Slater, our master of signals, and note
what each of you has to say relative to the
application for re-employment of Charles E.
Hal., the one-armed towerman who was for
EoniÃ time in our employ up to the A. R. U.
labor troubles In 1804, he taking a very de
cided stand against tha company at that time.
As I understand his case, he was not in any
way connected with those who disabled our
engines or destroyed our property, and his
record up to the time or the strike had been
all that could be expected of any employe.
Hence, particularly an he has a family to sup
port, the company has no objection whatever
to his being taken back in the service. Mr.
Cuvellier and several other citizens of Oak
laud, as well M yourself and Mr. Slater, hav
ing become interested in his behalf, 1 have
this day taken his name from the discharged
list, and you are at liberty to give him em
ployment in any position he is able to fill. â¢
In this connection, wish to say that any
others (especially men of lamily) whose names
have not been removed from the discharged
list, due to the fact that they have not, applied
for re-employment, but who are now desirous
of re-entering the service, if they are usetul
men to employ, and if they did not take such
active part as above referred to, namely, to ihe
extent of disabling our locomotives or destroy
ing our property, 1 desire that they be given
work whenever it is available, in preference
to engaging new men. Wo hare already
taken back uenr.y ail of the employes who lett
our service during the late labor troubles, and
with the prospect of an increase In business in
the course of sixty or ninety days, necessitat
ing the putting on of additional men, I trust
our requirements will be such that the few
whom. we have not yet been able to provide
work for wi.l b â¢ re-employed in our service.
Yours truly, â  J. A. Fillmork.

A BABY BOY'S
AWFUL PLUNGE
August Bernard Falls Fifty
Feet to a Concrete
Floor.
The Youngster Struck a Clothes
Line in His Descent Which
Saved His Life.
His Only Irjuries Were a Broken Leg
and a Bruised Foreheadâ A
Miraculous Escape.
Little August Bernard, the three-year
old son of Joseph Bernard, who resides in
a big family rooming-houÂ«e at 6 Maiden
lane, underwent a terrifying experience
last Tnesday afternoon and it is little
snort of miraculous that the baby boy
escaped with his life. This plump-faced
child with golden curls plunged from the
top story of the tenement-house to the
concrete floor below, a distance of almost
fifty feet. Fortunately he struck a clothes

From Which the Baby Fell.
line, rebounded into the air and wa* ;
thrown violently against a refuse barrel
ten feet distant from the line of his fall.
The barrel collated under the force of |
the little falling body and the child fell, i
his head striking the concre.e floor. He j
lay quite still for a minute as though life ;
was extinct, but finally slowly turned over i
and called for his mother.
Angelo Arata, a boy playing on the sec- j
ond floor of the building, heard the child's
cries and picked up the weeping baby and j
carried him to hit mother's room three
stories above.
A physician was hurriedly summoned, j
and it was found that the baby had sus
tained a fracture of his left thigh bone,
just below the hip. A big bruise oTer the j
forehead showed where the boy's head |
struck the concrete floor. These were the j
only injuries sustained by the child after j
a plunge through the air of half a hundred j
feet.
Little AueuÂ»t was placed in his crib and
after the limb had oeen set and bandaged
an eitension weight weiching several
pounds was attached to hit ankles. For !
forty days that weight will pull the limbs
with cruel force keeping the bones end to i
end that the child might, escape the misery
of going through this life a cripple. The
little boy does not cry or fret, but lies and j
looks with wondering eyes on those :
around him, who stand ever ready to add
to his comfort when possible.
It was owing to the rottenness of a frail !
Tailing around the court on the upper floor j
that the accident occurrei.

WANTED TO VIEW
A PALATIAL HOME
W. H. Van Pelt Surrepti
tiously Enters a Capi
talist's Residence.
He Enjoyed the Luxurious Fur
nisnings for a Time and
Then Left.
E E. Denicke, Owner of the Premises,
Gave Chase and Had the In
truder Arrested.
William H. Van Pelr, who claims to be
' a tailor by occupation, was locked ud in
the California-street police station last
j evening en a charge of burglary. It is
j hardly probable, bowewr, iha; he will be
! convicted on the charge, as the action on
his part which caused his arrest seems to
| have been prompted by an overwhelming
desire to view the interior of a million
' aire's residence rather than a lust to break
, in and steal.
The prisoner wai sauntering around
Nob Hil! at dusk and finally arrived at
the corner of Mason and Sacramento
streets, in front of Ernest A. Denicke's
residence. He looted longingly at the
palatial home for a minute and then, as if
accustomed to the environment, sauntered
up to the door and entered.
Ten minutes later one of the maid
servants of the house found him wander
ing up and down the parlors, enjoying
tnÂ« soft carpets and looking with pleasure
on the work* o: art around him.
For a sliort time the servant was badly
frightened, but as the surreptitious visi
tor manifested no dangerous traits of
character she finally mustered courage
and asked him the object of his intrusion.
The stranger smiled, mumbled a few
words and politely bidding the servant
eood day walked slowiy from the house.
Mr. Denicke, who is the president of
the Mechanics' Institute, forgot the dig
nity of his position when informed of the
occurrence in his parlor and quickly
grasping his hat ran out of the house in

He finally spied him wandering slowly
down Sacramento street and started to
follow 012 a run. When Van Pelt heara
Mr. Denicke's footsteps raining on the
pavement behind him he dropped his
nonchalant manner and fled for liberty.
Officers Caples, Long and Williams wit

At Sacramento and Dupont streets the
tailor stopped for a moment to "mend
his bellows," and as he is a slow starter in
a footrace he was pounced upon and cap
mred before he could a^ain get under
way. He ief used to explain hit conduct
in a satisfactory manner, saying that be
simply wanted to view the interior of a
capitalist's residence, so he was charged
with burglary.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 13, 1897.
THE CITY TO OWN
ITS WATER WORKS
Progressive Move Made
by the Improvement
Clubs.
Will Force the Issue Before
the Board of Super
visors.
Competent Engineers to Make a
Complete Irquiry Into the
Scbjec- Matter.
The San Francisco Association of Im
provement Clubs met last evening and
determined that this City must in the
near luture own its own water, gas and
electric-light plants. The association feels
strong enough to accomplish thiÃ, ana it
proposes to brine to bear all the strength
of the affiliated improvement clubs of the
City, the labor unions and all of the
strength of the local civic and commer
cial bodies that can be induced to take up
the tig lit.
The first move will be to secure munici
pal ownership of the City's water supply.
This was decided upon last evening at a
special meeting of the representatives of
the associated clubs. The matter was
brought up by the report of the special
committee, which reads as follows:
To the San Frayicifico Association of Improve
ment Club*â Gentlemen : Your committee on
public utilities beg to submit for your consid
eration the following resolu;ions with the
recommendation that they be adopted:
Whereas, The Board of Supervisors of the
City and County of San Francisco has for some
time past been engaged in the investigation of
the subject oi truer rates, and particularly of
the value of the Spring Valley Water Works,
in order to establish a basis by which they
should be guided in fixing reasonable water
rates for the ensuing year; and whereas, the
valuation put upon its property by the Spring
Valley Water Works in grossly inflated and
steadily increasing from year toyear, and that
by reason thereof tfce water ratrs based upon
sucn valuation are unjust and exhorbitant
not only to the municipality, but also
to the individual rate payers; and
whereas, various propositions have been sub
mitted to tormer Hoards of Supervisors of this
City and County which are now on Hie in the
office of the clerk of said Board of Supervisors,
offering 10 furnish this City with a good and
sufficient supply of pure water for a reason-
I able sum of money, whereby the rates lor
water in this City would be reduced at least
one. half uinl the municipality saved at least
$213,000 per annum; therefore be It
Resolved, r;y this association, that the Board
of Supervisors be requested to appoint without
delay a corps of engineers to examine into
and report to the Board of Supervisors as to
the cost, quantity and quality of water and
practicality of the various propositions now
pending before the Board of Supervisors lor
the municipat ownership of water worts by
the City anu County of San Francisco; and be
it further
Rtsolvtd, That if said corps of engineers re
port favorably upon any of said propositions
that the Board oi Supervisors of me City and
County of San Francisco immediately proceed
to acquire such property and take such steps
' as wi-1 lead to municipal ownership of water
I <vorks in accordance with the provisions of
I f actions 6 and 8 of an act of the Legislature of
this State, approved March 19, 1889, entitled
"An act authorizing the incurring of ln
debteness by cities, towns and municipal cor
porations incorporated under the laws oi this
State for ihe construction of water works,
sewers and all necessary public improvements
or for any purpose whatever," us said sections
I are amended by tho act of March 1, 1893
1 (statutes 1893, page 01) ; and be 1 1 further
Resolved. That the secretary of thie associa
! tion be instructed to transmit a copy of these
: resolutions to the Board of Supervisors and
| also to ail civic organizations, requesting their
' euriy consideration and joint co-operation;
and be it turther
Resolved, That we commend the efforts of the
Mayor and Board of supervisors and the
i public press of this City in eliciting the ile-
I tailed information in relerence to the subject
j oi water rates and properties now available
â  for the public interests.
Nearly every one present had a word to
say favorable to the foregoing resolutions
and its purpose, and many statistical
facts were dwelt upon showing the advan
tage of municipal ownership of the City's
â ource of water supply. The resolutions
passed without a dissenting voice.
It was decided that the co-operation of
the entire public be tsked in this move.
President Fletcher, by direction of the
association, appointed a committee of five,
who will preseut this matter to the Super
visors at once, and before the meeting
draw into this movement as many other
organizations as possible. The committee
consists of ex-Judge A. W. Thompson, L.
Samu"ij, Major D. McKinne, C. A. Alpers
and Joseph Sheerer. President Fletcher
and Vice-Presidents William Metzner and
Joseph Grady will also be on this com
mittee.
GIBSON UNDER A STRAIN.
This Is the Reason He Public'y
Assigns for His Resig
nation.
Emmanuel Church Has Offered to
Increase His Salary to Induce
Him to Remain.
There was an unusually large atten
dance at the quarterly business meeting of
Emmanuel Baptist Church last night as
the matter of the resignation of Rey.
G<*orge J. Gibson was on the tapis for con
sideration.
There were about 125 members present
and there was a unanimous sentiment
made manifest in favor of the retention of
the pastor.
It was finally decided to tender him an
incrpase of salary as an inducement to re
main, and a committee of five was ap
pointed to confer with him in reference to
the matter. His salary is now $100, and
the proposition is to advance it to $125.
The conference will take place at the resi
dence of C. W. Taber, one of the trustees
of the church, on Saturday evening.
Mr. Gibson was present during the dis
cussion, ana in explaining his reasons for
being so persistent in his efforts to have
his resignation accepted stated he was de
sirous of changing his field of labor?, be
cnuse of the peculiar associations that at
tended the double tragedy enacted within
the walls of the church. He declared that
for the past two years he has been under a
constant strain, owing to these matters,
and hoped that a change of scene would
restore to him bis peace of mind.
Incidentally the financial affairs of the
church were discussed, and it was an
nounced that it was in better condition to
day tb&n it bad ever been before in ita his
tory.
Alumni Banquets.
The annual banquet of the Alumni of the
University of California took place at the Cali

The graduates of the medical department of
the university class of '97, forty-six in num
ber, including several ladies, sat down to a
banquet in the Palace Hotel. The banquet
was given by the Alumni Association with the
co-operation Â©f the medical lacutty.
FOUGHT FOURTEEN
SAVAGE ROUNDS
A Desperate Battle in Hayes
Valley Last Sun
day.
Two Hermann-Street Boys, Each
of Whom Held a Grudge
lor the Other.
"Ea" Donnelly and "Billy" McDonald
Were the Priccipsls, and "Bil.y"
McKnight the Referee.
A desperate prizefight, in which two
young men well known in Hayes Valley
were the principals and a newspaper man
of that vicinity the referee, took place on
Sunday morning last at tbe stone quarry
on Fifteenth and Tilden streets, and all
concerned have been making strenuous
efforts to keep the matter quiet for fear of
complications with the police.
The battle laated through fourteen bloody
rounds and only terminated when both
men were too exhausted to continue and
the referee decided tne contest a draw.
Ever since J. J. Corbett, erstwhile cham
pion of the world, who was a Hayes Val
ley boy, made his debut in that role boxing
has been a favorite pastime with the youth
of the section and many promising "scrap
pers" have been developed. Among them
are "Ed" Donnelly and "Uilly" McDonald
of Hermann street, and between them a
rivalry has long existed that recently at
tained tue dignity of a grudge. From
hard feelings to fight was but a short
distance for the embryo pugilists and a
couple of weeks ago a contest to a finish
was arranged and both men went into
training.
The affair became public talk in the
valley and when tue men went into the
ring that had been pitched, on Sunday
last, a big crowd of onlookers, who had
quietly sneaked in from all directions, was
present to see the battle. Each man was
seconded by two friends and "Billy" Mc-
Knight of the Hayes Valley Advertiser
was chosen referee in the absence of a
well-known young man who was com
pelled to go on a trii> tho day previous.
The men were equally mulched in size
and weight and lost no time in getting to
gether when Referee McKnight called
"time."
Old ringsters would have traveled miles
to see that mill, for both men were glut
tonÃ for punishment and were so nearly
equal as to cleverness that the tide of bat
tle did not turn perceptibly to either.
Hard glovesâ practically skin tight, be
cause they only weighed two ounces each â
were used and the blows that landed told,
the faces of both being covered with blood
before many rounds had been fought.
For ten rounds the fight was fast and
furious, but the tremendous exertion told
on both, and toward the close the young
men were so exhausted that they were
scarcely Able to stand. Knockdowns were
frequent, but neither was able to land a
decisive blow.
At the end of the fourteenth round,
when the seconds bad to lift their men
out of their corners in order to get them
on their lees. Keferce McKnight decided
that honor had been satisfied, and that
both of the tighter* might be called game.
They were carefully escorted home and
are still nursing tueir hurt*, while the
valley discusses the mill with admiration
and bated breatb.
It is rumored that the prize for which
Donnelly and McDonald fought was tne
good will of a certain fair one who is
nameless, but this is a matter of conjec
ture except to a favored few.
PUEE POOD CONGRESS.
The Promoter* Will Soon MÂ«kÂ« This a
Permanent Organization.
The regular meeting of the directors of
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation was held yesterday, and considera
ble attention was given to the sub
ject of permanent organization of the Pure
Food Congress which was recently held
under the auspices of the association.
The desire is to spread the movement
nil over the State and have all of the local
county bodies members of ttie Congress.
The directors yesterday did not decide
iiimn a plan, so the matter was left in the
hands of A. Sbarboro, L Jacobs and Sam
McKee, who will suggest the lines upon
which the congress will permanently or
ganize. This committee will alr.o look
after cases of violation of the pure food
laws now before the Police courts. It was
stated that Judge Campbell will dismiss
all ot these cases unless the prosecutors
take hold of these matters in earnest.
President Kerr was instructed to ap
point ten delegates to the Trans-Missis
sippi Congress, which will meet in Salt
Lake on Juiv 14. These delegates will be
instructed to make a fight against the
shipping into California of convict-made
goods.
Secretary Mead was directed to send a
telegram to W. R. Hearst of New York,
requesting, in the name of the association,
that he uee only California materials in
the construction of the new Examiner
building on Market and Third streets.
