HAVANA, Cuba, May 24.â 1t is reported
from Santiago de Cuba ihat the Spanish
military train from El Cristo to Longo
vraa attacked by 600 insurgents. The train
was carrying troops to re-enforce the garri
son at Longo. At the first shots of the
insurgents the train was stopped and
Lieutenant La Fuente, commanding the
Spaniards, ordered the mtn to fire. At
that moment several dynamite bombs ex
pio'ied, killing La Fuente, twelve Spanish
privates, and wounding thirty-two others.
The locomotive and a car were destroyed.
The bpamards surrendered and the
Cubans after plundering the train burned
the remaining cars. Sixty Spanish
soldiers and twenty other persons, em
ployes of the railroad and officers of the
Spanish Government, were made prison
ers. Two hours later they were set free
by order of General Garcia.
The Spanish military commander at
Lonjro was afraid to go to the aid of the
troop;. He waited until they were re
leased and the insurgents far away. Then
he sallied forth and near the town killed
two countrymen, one a non-combatant.
He then returned to town, reporting a
victory over the insurgents.
GeneraJ Calixto del Key, who, a^ rÂ«
po:!cd la=t month, was recalled from
Santiago de Cuba by Weyler on account
of his dire defeat by Garcia at Guamo,
embarked yesterday for Spain. He said
Weyler is not the man to quell the revo
lution in Orient. In Rey's opinion 200,
--000 Sjitmish soldiers in the province of
Santiago de Cuba alone could not subdue
the Cubans in less than a year.
The commander of the Spanish gun
boat Conde de Venadito intended Â»o land
come of his crew near Baracoa to attack
the Cuban camp. Hs dispatched a boat
for shore, but half-way on its journey
two volleys from the Cubans Killed sev
eral men in the boat and obliged tne
others to return. The gunboat fired three
shots from cannon without hitting the
Cubans. Tee latter answered with rifles,
killing a Spanish sergeant and Reas Diaz,
who was on the deck of the Conde de
Venadito. The gunboat then retired.
JUcKISLEI'S FJB3I PVJsICY.
Ihe I'renidtnt Intends to Secure Freedom*
for Cuba.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 24.â The
President's Cuban policy la still a matter
of much uncertainty. He has taken very
lew of hia friends into his confidence on
the subject, ana even some members of
the Cabinet claim to be entirely unin
formed of what, if any, plan the President
has decided upon. It appears to be cer
tain now that no definite action of any
eort will be taken prior to Calboun's re
turn, and while awaiting his report the
President and Judge Day, who has eÂ«p â¢
cial charge of Cuban affairs for the State
Department, will carefully consider al!
information on file. Not & word was said
about Cuba during the brief session of the
House this morning, and notwithstand
ing the anxiety of the enthusiastic friends
of the Cuban cause to secure action upon
the Senate belligerency resolu'ion, it is
evident the Speaker, Chairman Hitt and
Leader Dingley have resolved to prevent
action 01 debate on the resolution until
the President indicates his desires.
In the meantime all sorts of reports are
in circulation as to the part the executive
will play in ending the war and bringing
about Cuban freedom. All that is defi
nitely known, however, is it is the inten
tion of the President and Cabinet to use
the good offices of tne United States in
some manner for tne lasting benefit of the
insurgents. Cuban independence is what
the administration ia evidenty aiming at,
and they will probably agree to the policy
of intervention on the part of the United
States if tliis be found to be what is
needeJ.
There are indications that the President
has already sounded the Spanish Minister
on the subject of mediation based on the
reports of Consul-General Lee and other
representatives of the United States in
Cuba, and that the tentative offer has
been declined, as wasOiney's about a year
ego.
Congressmen who talk with the Presi
dent daily do not succed in learning much
as to the details of his policy, but all of
them represent h ira as enthusiastically in
favor of the Cuban cause and determined
to do all in his power to assist in making
Cuba absolutely and forever free.
Speaker Reed has decided upon the pol
icy he will pursue respecting the Morgan
Cuban resolution, which passed the Sen
a'e last week and is now on the Speaker's
tnble. He has talfced with a majority of
the Republican members and with the
leaders of tie majority and has practically
the solid support of his party. On the
promise heJd out by Speaker Reed tha
the President would soon send a message
to Congress on tt.e Cuban question the ar

i
LONDON, Ekg.. May 24.â T0-day is the
seventy-eighth anniversary of the birth of j
Queen Victoria, and the occasion was cele
brated throughout the United Kingdom
and the colonies with the ringing of church
belis and the firing 01 salutes.
The formal exercises in this city will not
take place untii Wednesday, the Queen
having expressly n quested this postpone
ment in order that she might gain an ad
ditional day's rest at Baimoral.
In the remaining cities of Great Britain,
however, patriotic exercises were held in
the schools, and receptions and banquets
were given in the evening under the aus
pices of the various municipal corpora
tions.
The Queen herself spent the day qnietly
at her old oastle, her advancing years
rendering it inadvisable, if not imposaible, i
for her to take an active part in these an- '
nual observances, as has been her custom
in years gone by.
Countless messages of congratulation
have bsen received by her Majesty during
the past twenty-four hours from the
heads of almost every Government, as
well as from the representatives of the
court of St. James.
Several of the members of the Cabinet
cave full dress dinners and receptions
this evening in honor of the anniversary,
and during the afternoon there were mili
lary parades throughout the kingdom,
the near approach of the diamond jubilee
festivities in no way serving to over
shadow the brilliancy of the events.
MONTREAL. Canada, May 24. â The
birthday of Queen Victoria was generally
observed throughout the Dominion. Busi
ness was generally suspended, and the re
ligious services of ihe morning were fol
lowed by all manner of spring festivities,
and concluded with brilliant fireworks in
Jheevening. This anniversary is regarded
as marking in a measure the opening of
the summer season, and so, apart from its
original significance, has come to be a
period of general merrymaking and re
joicing, being possibly more enthusiast
ically observed than in the mother coun
try.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 24.-The
Queen's birthday was celebrated to-night
at the Holland House by the British
schools and universities' club with a din
ner attended by most of the prominent
Englishmen of this city. Rev. Dr. Parker
Morgan, who presided, responded to the
tonet, "The Queen."
"No kinder woman," said Morgan, "ever

with this country when Garneld was shot,
and among the first to send a message of
condolence to the widow of Grant. Such
little attions Imve won for her the love

CAPTAIN ROKEYN PARDONED.
But in Ex ending Clemency the President
â¢â  Severely Reprimands the
â¢Officer.
â  WASHINGTON. D.C., : May 24â Final
action was taken by the President to-day
in the case of Captain Henry Romeyn, U.
S. A., recently tried at Fort McPherson,
Ga., on a number of charzes growing out
of his criticisms ,; of the conduct of Mrs.
Michael J. O'Brien, wife of the lieutenant
who represented this country in the
Chine-Japan war. The court-martial sen
t< need Rom ey to dismissal from the ser
vice. .This sentence is disapproved by the
President on* aci 1% of the officer's rec
ord of long' serv and approaching re
tirement.. A severe reprimand of Romeyn
is Â» contained, however, in the President's
decision. Romeyn is restored to rank and
duty. He will be placed on the retired
list for ace on June 1.:
The President's decision says: "The
proceedings, findings and sentence in the
case of Captain Henry Romeyn, Fifth In
fantry, are approved, but upon recom
mendation of the majority of the members
of the co^rt-martial and consideration of
his long and honorable service, of his
wound received in battle, of the medal of
honor held by him for distinguished gal
lantry in action, of the fact he will by
operation of law be retired for age on the
Ist day of June, and of his appeal to the
executive for clemency the sentence
awarded by the court is remitted. In do
ing so, however, I cannot fail to express
my condemnation of the conduct of
which Romeyn is found guilty, and regret
that he failed upon the occasion to con
trol bis temper in a manner becoming his
service and age."

ATHENS, Greece, May 24â The Gov

The Greeks have formed a second line of

Excellent Tims Made by the
Wheeling on a Trial :
Trip
OVER THE NEW MEAS
URED COURSE.
Will Probably Exceed by Sev
eral Knots the Required
Speed.
MAY BEAT THE NASHVILLE'S
RECORD.
To-Day Her Sister Ship, the Marietta,
Will Be Sent Over the
o : fie ial Course.
The new gunboat Wheeling made her
first trial trip yesterday morning: over the
new measured course just fixed by the
United States Government for tne pur
pose of trying the speed of the Wheeling
and its sister-bout, the Marietta. T.e
course begins at the new beacon on the
north shore of Raccoon Strait and extends
a distance of 6080 feet northward, just be
yond California City.
On the; second attempt the Wheeling
crossed the distance in four minutes one
second, making 894 revolution?. This was
at the rate of 15 knots an hour, which
is considered a most remarkable perform
ance i for a ship leaving her dock for the
first time. Her lowest speed was 13 knots.
The maximum revolutions of the engine
were.246, minimum 220. The Wheeling
gives every promise of exceeding by con
siderable on her official trial the average
speed of 13}Â£ knots required by the Gov
ernment. . ' . '
| The Wheeling and the Marietta are two
of a group of six gunboats ordered by the
Government j March 2, 1895. They are of
light draught, j composite structure, ; and
have a displacement of about 1000 tons.
Both vessels are fitted with twin screws
and will carry very little canvas.
.The two gunboats differ in regard to
their boilers, the one being fitted- with
Howden boilers and the other with boil
ers of the . Babcock & Wilcox type. The
triali of the two vessels now being made
will be of particular interest as showing
the superiority of one or the other of
these two types of boilers. :rv -"
The boats are of composite structure,
the steel framing and plating below the
water-line being covered, with 4-inch pine
and teak planking, thus enabling them to
remain at sea for considerable time with
out docking.
Following are the dimensions of the
vessels: Length on j load water line, 174
feet; beam on load water line, 34 feet;
draught, normal, from under side of keel,
12 feet; displacement, normal, 1000 tons;
indicated horsepower, 800. Tne arma
ment consists of twelve rapid-firing guns,
six 4-pounders, four 6- pounders and two
1-pounders. Ammunition will be carried
as follows: For the 4-pounders 900 round?,
for the 6 pounders 2000 rounds and for the
1-pounders 1200 rounds.
The engines are vertical, triple-expan
sion and direct acting, consisting of a
high-pressure cylinder 12 inches, inter
mediate , cylinder 18)4 inches and ~, low
pressure 28 inches. The- stroke is 18
inches.
The engines were expected to make
about 200 revolutions uer minute with a
steam pressure of 180 pounds in the
boilers. '-.-. i v r * -.;
. The Wheeling and the Marietta were
launched simultaneously at the Union
Iron Works on the 18th of last March. It
was said to have been â¢ the first recorded
instance of two vessels being launched at,
the same time from the same yard by dif
ferent ways. .
To-day the Marietta will be sent over the
official course to standardize or fix the
value of the revolutions of her screw.. That
having been definitely ascertained she will
be - run morrow for four â  consecutive
hours. The revolutions will be carefully
counted, and .using the value of the revo
lution thus obtained as standard her spued
will be figured from that.
The two boats will undoubtedly exceed
the designed speed by three knots, and
may establish a record ahead of that made
on Long Island Sound about a week ago
by the gunboat Nashville, which made an
average speed of 16.76 knots. :

ST. LOUIS, Mo., May 24. â "Silver
D ck" Bland passed through this city to
day en route to Hannibal, where he will
participate in the campaign in the First
Congressional District. He said:
"The money question will t>? a more in
tense issue in 1900 than in the last cam
paign. The people by that time will
begin to realize more than ever that they
need bimetallism. They know it now,
and I believe an election to-day would re
sult in a victory for a Democratic Presi

Of the Sound Money Democrats Bland
said: "Any man who voted against
Brvan is not a Democrat. It makes no
difference how many Jcffersonian cradles
he was rocked in. if he tailed to stand by
the Chicago platform he is not a Demo
crat. There Is no compromise to be made
with the bolters. There is no disposition
to prevent them from coming back into
the party, but they should understand
that in order to be Democrats again they
must do the coming back themselves. I
see no more reason for compromising
with Palmer an i Buckner than with a
man who voted lor McKmiey."2
STRANGE STORY OF
THE BLACK ART
Expert Assayers Test
the Claims of Edward
C. Brice.
They Report Adversely to the
Theory That Cold Can Be
Manufactured.
But the Enterprising Chicago Man
Says He Is Making the Precious
Metal.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 24.-A
strange story, in which the black art of
medievalism applied by modern methods
and the threatened upsetting of the
present financial conditions are leading
features, came out to-day through the
submission of an official report to the
Secretary of the Treasury by Preston, Di
rector of the Mint.
The report tells of the investigation by
three Government officials into the pro
cess for producing or creating silver and
gold from base m*ta!s, the secret that al
chemists have been trying to solve for
centuries. The investigation has created
excitement among men of high financial
standing, mystified scientific men and
caused uneasiness and amazement in the
Treasury Department.
The man who secured the investigation
is Edward C. Brice of Chicaso. The rec
ords in the Patent Office show that on
May 7, 1896. he filed an application for a
patent for creating gold and silver, claim
ing he could rroduce these from base
metals such as lead, tin and antimony.
The patent was twice refused on the
ground that no practical application of
the process had been shown, but Brice
continued to press the claim, and the
Patent Office officials promised to give
him a chance to show what could be done
by his method.
Last month the Secretary of the Inte
rior asked Secretary Gage for permission
to make experiments in the laboratory of
the Mint Bureau. Director Preston on
May 3 appointed a commission of three of
the best sssayers in the Government ser
vice to carry out Gage's instructions.
Tney are Andrew Mason, Superintendent
of the Assay Office at New York, D. K.
Tnttle, melter and refiner of the Philadel
phia Mint, and Cabell Whitehead, as-
Barer of the Mint Bureau in Washington.
The commission metat the Mint Bureau
May 5. and after making many experi
luents of their own devising, at Brioe's
snggestion submitted to Director Preston
last Saturday a report, which was handed
to Secretary Gage to-day. The supplies
purchased for the experiment were labeled
"chemically pure." Brice nad requested
that only chemically pure materials be
used. The commission made a test by
Brice's formula and found "small but
weighable quanties of cold and silver in
the so-called chemically pure Â»ntimonv."
Other samples were produced from differ
ent sources with a like result and things
looked bright for Brice.
"While seeking for pure antimony,"
says the commission in its report, "we
accepted the offer of Brice that he should
supervise and direct the trial of the pro
cess upon antimony known to contain
pmall amounts of silver and gold and
that be should conduct the assay of ihe
same antimony for comparison of the re
sults from his own assay methods with
those from his creative process. His as
say in which he scorified one-half an
assay ton of antimony (one assay ton
equals 29,166 grains) with one-half an
assay ton of lead showed the antimony to
contain .066 ounces of gold and .317 ounces
silver per ton.
"Brice now subjected five ounces of this
antimony to his creative process. His
yield after treatment showed gold .084
ounces per ton of antimony, and .670
ounces of silver per ton ox antimony used.
Your committee followed up the work by
making an assay of the same metal,
following well known and approved
methods of assaying:, with tha following
results: Gold, 100 ounces per ton, and
silver 120 ounces per ton of antimony. A
comparison of this result will show that
Brice found by his assay 66 per cent of
gold and 26.40 per cent of silver actually
present in the materials used. By his
creative process he recovered 84 per cent
of gold and 55.84 per cent of silver origi
nally present in the materials."
It was judged by the commission that
they were not likely to obtain decisive re
sults as ion;: as they worked on materials
containing appreciable quantities of silver
and gold. They found nil the available
samples of metallic antimony to contain
minute but appreciable quantities of gold
and silver. They undertook the task of
preparing antimony upon which assay
should not show even a trace of either of
these metals. The report gives in detail
all the experiments conducted and sums
up as follows:
"During these experiments, which have
now extended over some three weeks and
have involved an amount of painstaking
labor which we hope has not been entirely
wasted, we Lave not seen the slightest
evidence of any creation or transmuta-
i ion. On the contrary the claimant failed
in every instance to recover the entire
amount of silver and cold known to De
preÂ«ent in the materials.
"The claimant seems to have devised a
variety of irrational and wasteful methods
for recovering a portion of silver and gold
known to metallurgists as being present
in many commercial nietaJj, such as anti
mony and lead."
Brice is not satisfied with the result of
the commission's work. He claims as the
supplies for conducting the experiments
*vere purchased from the best dealers in
ti:e country and regarded as chemically
pure, the goid obtained was created by his
process Bnce also claims hn is produc
ing gold and silver on a commercial scale
at his works in Chicago :ind making it
pay. He says he bus produced thousands
of dollars and has invested $25,000.
IN THE SUPREME COURT.
Several Important Land Cases of Interest
to the Pacific Coast Are Passed
Upon.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 24.âSev
eral important land cases were disposed
of Ly the Supreme Court to-day. Tha first
cf these wpre appeals of the United States
and Levi P. Morton from the judgment o!
the Court of Private Land Claims relating
to what is known as the San Miguel Del
bado grant in New Mexico, containing
acres claimed by Juan Sandovul et
al. It was decided that unallotted por
tions of the grant at the time of the
Guadalupe Hidalgo treaty were subject to
the laws governing the public domain and
that the Court of Private Land Claims
had no jurisdiction to determine title.
The Court of Private Land Claims gave
judgment in favor of Saudoval and re
jected the claim of Morton to the land.
The judgment in favor of Sandoval was
reversed and that against Morton affirmed.
The judgment of the same court in the
case of Joel Parker Whitney et al., claim
ants of the ( ochiti craat in New Mexico,
was affirmed. Tne claimants wanted
about 100,000 acres. The court gave them
about 5000.
Justice Harian announced in the case
of Peter Milotti vs. Kate May Dillon and
Mary Ives Crocker that any pre-emption
of homestead swamp land or other lawful
claim* to Jands in California pending at
the time of the passage of the Centra! Pa
cific land grant acts of 1 862-64 was not dis
turbed by the operation of those acts.
Tne c aim ot Anna J. Dominguez de
Guyer et al. to possession of the Mormon
Islands, in ihe inner bay of San Pedro,
California, wa3 decided adversely. Jus
tice Harlan stated in this decision that
the court did not pass upon the claim of
William Banning to the island nor ques
tion whether lands under navigable
waters of the bay passed to the State of
California upon its admission to the
Union.
The judgment in the case of the claim
of the Rio Arriba .Land and Cattle Com
pany lor confirmation to its title to the
Canyon de Chama grant in Ne\v Mexico,
comprL-ing 473,C00 acre?, was affirmed.
The city 01 Sin Angelo. Texas, will
have to pay $10,000 on bonds issued in
1889 for street improvements. After is
suing the bonds the incorporation was
dissolved because of alleged irregularities
in the proceedings and immediately rein
corporated under the same name with the
same officials. The new corporation
repudiated payment of the bonds, but the
Supreme Court to-day said the> would
have to be paid.
The court when it adjourned cairied
over until the next term twenty-one cases
that have been argued this term. Among
them was the case involving the validity
of a land grant to the Southern Pacific
Railroad in California; the case of Wong
Kirn Ark, presenting the auestion whether
a son barn in the United States takes citi
zenship by reason of his nativity ; the case
of the Westingnouse Company aaamst the

ACTION ON THE TARIFF BILL.
Satisfactory Plan Arranged at the Meeting
cf ihe Caucus of R publican
Senators.
WASHINGTON. D. OL, May 24.â 1t, took
over four hours for the caucus of Repub
lican Senators 10 reach an agreement to
day on a satisfactory plan of action on the
tariff bill. This result was not reached
without much heated debate, the wool
men in particular being very outspoken
and aggressive. Clarke of Wyoming made
one of the strongest speeches in favor of
higher rates on wooJ. The only formal
vote in the caucus was on the proposition
to appoint a steering committee to take
charge of the tariff bill during its journey
through the Senate, which was opposed
by many Western Senators. The ma
jority of the cauens, however, was with
the Finance Committee and the motion
was agreed to. The steering committee
will consist of Republican members of the
Finance Committee, and three others to
be appointed by the chairman of the cau
cus.
Allison, in order to reduce to a mini
mum the delay in disposing of the tariff
bill in caucus, agreed that its member.-;
deliver no lone set Breeches, and attacks
of the opposition are to be replied to in
the briefest manner possible. On the ques
tion ot amendments, offered by individual
Republican Senators, it was practically
agreed that these amendments should
first be submitted to the Finance Com
mittee. If the committee decided against
the amendment, then the caucus would
be called to pass upon it, ami the pro
poser would abide by the verdict of the
caucus. There were some very pertinent
remarKs upon the sugar schedule, but it
was agreed to postpone action upon this
and other particular schedules in dispute
until after Aldrich's statement is made
to-morrow.
The caucus of Republican Senators on
the tariff bill lasted from 12:15 o'clock un
til 4:15 this afternoon. Among tne prin
cipal speakers were Senators Aldrich of
Rhode Island and Perkins of California.
Senator Perkins advocated a stamp tax
instead of the proposed internal revenue
tax on beer, tea and tobacco. He thought
that a five or ten stamp to lie affixed to
bank checks, stock certificates, montages,
deeds and papers of that kind which are
as a rule ciiculated by wealthy or well to
do people would iurnish as much revenue
as tha proposed internal revenue tax on
beer, tea and tobacco, which wnul't fall
mobt Jieavily upon the poorer class of peo
ple. He thought the stamp tax would
provide ample revenue to make up the
deficit. He cited as an instance the stamp
tax on mining stock certificates which was
once imposed in California and furnished
a revenue of several thousand dollars a
month.
Senator Perkins also advocated a com
promise measure with regard to the Ha
waiian reciprocity treaty. He said tnat
be was receiving many messages each day
from every connty in which beet-sugar
was cultivated prsyinp that the treaty be
abrogated, and he could not ignore their
wishes. At the same time he had been
petitioned by business men and mercan
tile organizations in San Francisco and
other California cities asking for the con
tinuance of the treaty. He proposed a
compromise measure by which the duty
on sugar from the islands would be fixed
at I,' cent per pound after a year's notice
nau been given; or, as an alternative
proposition, that the duty be gradually re
duced from % of a cent a pound year
by year for a period of about five years,
until finally California would be able to
produce beet-sugar enough to supply the
people.
Senator Perkins said to The Call cor
respondent to-nisrht chat it looked as if
thÂ« general schedule as finally passed by
both houses would be equivalent to a
specific auty of 1% cents per pound on
supar from other countries than Hawaii
and that if after one year's nonce a duty
of % c?nt should bt imposed on sugar
from Hawaii it would be an equitable
settlement of the matter.
Senator Perkins made the suggestions
on merely tentative proportions from the
standpoint of party expediency, although
he is rather of the opinion that me
Hawaiian-treaty clause of the Dingley
bill will be restored.

ALL LITIGATION
NOW AT AN END
Mrs. Hinckley Is in Full
Possession of Blythe's
Estate.
Dismissal of the Writ of Error
by the Supreme
Court.
The Highest Federal Tribunal Had
No Jurisdiction to Interfere
In the Struggle.
WASHINGTON. D. C, May 24-The
! disposal of the Blythe millions by the
Supreme Court of California, by which
i they came into the possession of Florence
: Biytbs Hinckley, daughter of the de
ceased millionaire, will stand. The efforts
of the members of me Blythe family to
I induce the Supreme Court of the United
! States to bring the case be/ore that tribu
-1 nal have failed. Chief Justice Fuller tc-
I day announced the dismissal of the writ
of error for want of jurisdiction.
The dismissal in the United States Su
! preme Court yesterday of the writ ot error
i sued out by Henry T. Blytbe and others,
known as the "Gypsy BJythes," to have
! the Supreme Court review the decree
] of distribution made in favor ot Florence
j Blythe ends the long litigation for the
I possession of the millions which the late
| Thomas Blytbe accumulated.
Counsel for the gypsies fancied that
the cases could be tied up in the United
States Supreme Court for several years.
The attorneys for the heiress ore gratified
i that the question was settled within sixty
i days.
The point was raised and presented to
! the Supreme Court at Washington that
1 Florence Blythe, being an alien, could not
inherit property and mat tue law of the
State of California giving aliens the right
to inherit was invalid, and that nothing
but a treaty could confer on her the right
of inheritance.
W. H. H. Hart and Aylett R. Cotton
moved to dismiss the writ of error, on the
ground that the question sought to be
raised in regard to alienage is a State ques
tion; that tue several States have author
ity to confer upon aliens the right to in
herit property.
The United States Supreme Court dis
missed the application for review on the
ground that it did not present a Federal
question.
Ex-Attorney-General W. H. H. Hart,
the chief Lawyer of the heiress in the long
litigation, returned from Washington yes
terday morning. He was seen at his resi
' deuce last evening and expressed the
! opinion that the litigation was now at an
' end. He seemed delighted over the vie-
I tory gained for his client, and remarked
| tuat San Francisco would participate in the
( benefits of the final settlement of the case.
j He said thai Mrs. Florence Blytbe Hmck
, ley couid now go ahead and improve the
I valuable property in the center of the
; City. There were no lonz leases to inter
-1 fere with plans for constructing business
I blocks on the desirable land. In fact the
i lady has been in possession of the prop-
I erty for eighteen months, but the menace
i of litigation prevented improvement of
! the premises.
Mrs. Florence Hinckley Is living in
Oakland. As soon as the message was
received from Washington announcing
the decision of the Supreme Court in her
favor s!Â»e was advised of tne victory.
The lawyers connected with the win
ning side, apart from General Hart and
Judge Cotton, are John Garber, John ri.
Boa:t, Thomas B. Bishop and W. W.
Foote. The original contract provided
tliat the lawyers should receive 40 per
cent of the estate. The value of the
estate in San Francisco, rating property
at duil-time prices, is not less than
$2,500,000.

MADRID,' Spain, May 24.â As a result
of the quarrel between the Duke of Tetuan
and Senor Comas, Liberal members of
the Senate, the Liberals and principal
dissenting Conservatives absented them
selves from both houses of the Cortes to
day. Prime Minister Canovas made suc
cessive addresses in the Senate and Oh am
ber of Representatives, -declaring ; that
inasmuch as the Tetaan- Comas incident
had been settled he saw no reason for the
attitude of the opposition, which seemed
designed merely to compel, a crisis. He
appealed to the patriotism of the absen
tees in the presence of .-rave international
troubles, saying love of country should
lead them to resume their duties. He
hinted it was especially desirable that
Sajrasta, the Liberal leader, should return
and thereby contradict the rumors regard
ing his attitude toward Cuba and â : the
United States. In conclusion Canovas de
clared tnat whether the absentees re
turned or not the Government would con
' tinue to carry on public f business.V The
Government supporters 3 then adopted : a >
re- o ution requesting the President of the
Chamber of Representatives to attempt to
influence the absentees to return.

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 24.â The
House galleries were well nileo" to-day in
expectation that the Senate Cuban resolu
tion would be reported and might lead to
exciting scenes. The attendance of mem
bers was large. As soon as the journal
was read a motion to correct it was made
by Simpson. He showed the Senate pen
sion bill had baen referred to the commit
tee on invalid pensions and as there was
no such committee he moved to strike
out that statement.
"Strike it out of what?" the Speaker
asked with an air of bored indifference.
"Out of ihe record or out of the journal."
"Out of the journal," Simpson replied^.
â¢'I suppose it is tne same in the record."
The Speaker put the question on the
motion to strike it out, and declared it
losi. The journal was then approved.

Just c? Brewer Renders an Important
Decision Against the Interstate Com-
rnerca Commission.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 24.âSev
eral cases involving the construction of
parte of the interstate commercs law were
decided by tho Supreme Court to-day.
The most important was that of the In
terstate Commerce Commission vÂ«. the
Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific
Company upon the question asked by
the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cir
cuit, "Has the commission power to nx
rates?"
The question was answered by the court,
said Justice Brewer, in announcing judg
ment in the case to which the commis
sion and tbe Cincinnati Southern Rail
way were parties last year, when the
court said: "We do not find that any
provision of the act expressly or by neces
sary implication confer* such power."
That and other view 3 expressed in tbe
decision were vigorously ana earnesly
chaiieged by counsel for the commission,
and the court decided to re-examina the
question in its entirety and determine
what powers Congress had given the com
mission in respect to rates. State legisla
tion on the subject of railroad control
was reviewed at length, preliminary to
the discussion of the act of Congress.
The conclusion reached by the court, from
which Justice Harian dissented, was that
"Congress has not conferred upon the
commission legislative power lor pre
scribing rates, either minimum or mini
mum, as absolute. A3 it did not give
express power it, did not intend to secure
ihe same result indirectly by empower
ing that tribunal to determine what in
reference to the past was reasonable and
just and then enable it to obtain from
the courts a peremptory order that in
future railroad companies should follow
rates thus determined to have been in
the past reasonable and just."

San Jose Officials Are Notified and

LA GRANGE, Tex., May 24.â Officers
of Fayetto County are satisfied that they
have safely in their possession J. C. Dun
ham, badly wanted in California for mur
der, and Sheriff Loessin has received a
warrant from California and a notification
that San Jose officers will arrive in a lew
days to identify the prisoner.
The man under arrest claims to a busiÂ»
ne&s man of Fort Worth, Texas. He says
his name is "W. R. D. Merrill and that he
knows nothing of Dunham. Detective
Shoff of S.in Antonio and J. 0. Ferguson
are responsible for hi 3 arrest Ferguson
claims to know him well, and further
claims that Dunham has related to him at
various times the adventures of his many
escapes from officers who were searching
for him. When the two reached San An
tonio Ferguson saw a detective paper
contained a description and picture of
Dunham and also that $11,000 wai offered
for him.
Though no name had been given him
Ferguson at once recognized his traveling
companion to be the man wanted, so he
hunted ud Detective Suoff and the two
then went on a search for Dunham. He
evidently had become suspicious, for he
had left town. The officers followed him,
after ascertaining that Dunham had come
in this direction. They overtook him
here, and while the detective kept his
man in sight Ferguson notified Sheriff
Loessin and the arrest was effected with
out trouble, though the officers expected
it and were prepared for it.
Sheriff Loessin has notified the Califor
nia authorities and has received instruc
tions to hold the prisoner, as they are sat
fied the right man is held, and they will

Sheriff Lyndon Receive* Telegram* That
Put Bint in a Quandary.
SAN JOSE, Cai,., May 24.â Sheriff Lyn
don to-day received news of the capture
of James C. Dunham, the McGiincy mur
derer, in Wyoming, Alabama and Texns.
Each of the arresting officers is sure he
has the right man, and the Sheriff is re
quested to send some one to identify him
so there will be no unnecessary delay in
ceiling the 10,000 reward offered for the
fugitive. ,
The first telegram came from Caspar,
Wyo, The Constable there has a man un
der arrest who answers Dunham's descrip
tion in every way.
J. T. White. Marshal of Guln, Ala., was
next heard from. The news came in the
shape of a letter, with two pictures of the
suspect. They bore no resemblance to the
murderer, and Sheriff Lyndon ordered the
man released.
This afternoon a dispatch was received
from Dan Jenkins, Marshal of Smithville,
Tex,, saying he had arrested Dunham.
A few minutes later Sheriff A. Loessin of
La Grange, Tex., was heard from. He
said James C. Dunham had been lodged
in jail by Marshal Jenkins and requested
tbe Sheriff to come after him. He also
said the man confessed to being wanted
for murder in California. Sheriff Lyndon
notified the Texas officers to send on
pictures and description of the man ar
rested.
The Sheriffs office places little reliance
in any of the arrests, although the man
has been ordered held until his descrip
tion arrives.
Sheriff Lyndon is neither confident nor
satisfied that the man in jail at Fayette,
Texas, is James C. Dunham, the fugitive
murderer of the McGlincy family, but has
taken steps to have a thorough investiga
tion mace. This course is pursued with
every report that Dunham has been cap
tured, and as a result there have been
many investigations during the pa-t rear.
In an interview this evening Sheriff Lyn
don told of the correspondence in regard
to the present suspect.
"We received a telegram from Smitb
ville, Tex., a little town near La Grange,
last Wednesday. It was from a man
named Dan Jenkins, who wanted to know
if we wanted J. C. Dunham. We at once
sent him circulars containing a minute
description of the fugitive. Early this
morning we received another telegram
from Jenkins to the effect that he bad
Dunham under arrest. He wanted us to
send some one after the prisoner. We an
swered that owing to the long distance we
wanted to be sure that Dunham had been
found before we would send an officer.
We instructed Jenkins to have the pris
oner's picture taken and tent to us, and
told bim that if he was the right man we
would be after him aa fast aa the train
would take us.
"Jenkins answered that h e would have
the pictures taken at once and would mail
them to-day. That was the last we hoard
of Jenkins. He must have turned the
prisoner over to Sheriff Loessin of Fay
ette County, for the next telegram was
from that official and was dated Lawrence.
It said: 'I hold one James C. Dunham,
who confesses to De a murderer from Cali
fornia. Come at once before he escapes.'
"We bad received no information to
justify a belief that the prisoner was Dun-
Ham, but to insnre the holding of the sus
pect Den. ling an investigation we tele
graphed a warrant of arrest. Soon after
â ,vc received another telegram from Loes
sin, in which he said that the prisoner
agreed with the description furnished the
Pmlcerton Detec ivÂ» Agency. He sent no
description, however, and we telegraphed
to him for a detailed statement and a de
scription cf tne prisoner. Ttiis telegram
lias not yet been answered, bat we expect
a reply to-morrow morning."

FITZ VIEWS THE
FIGHT ON CANVAS
Declares That the Vera
scopic Pictures Are
Elegant.
Makes Excited Comments on
the Blows as They Are
Repeated.
Scofrs at the Talk About a Foul
and Threatens to Bring Suit
for Damages,
NEW YORK, N. V., May 24.âAccom
panied by Martin Julian and a few friends,
Fitzsimmons to-day viewed the verascope
Pictures of the Carson fight for the first
time. He made excited comments on the
blows as they were repeated on the can
vas. In the sixth round, when Fitzsim
mons was pictured as dropping on hi*
knees, his arms slipping down and around
Corbett's knees, Fitz leaped excitedly to
his feet in the stage box, yelling:
"He threw me. He just cot his arm un
der mine and twisted me over. It wasn't
a knockdown, as one can easily see. Siler'3
counting goes for nothing, as he is trying
to follow Muldoon, the official timer.
Can't you see Muldoon counting off ibe
seconds? And there's Jimmy Colviile,
Corbett's official timer. Why doesn't he
make a howl about my being down more
than ten seconds? Why don't hundreds
of sports who are holding watches around
the ring? Because lam only down nine
seconds; nn more."
When the Cornishman on canvas re
sumed fighting, a man in the gailery
cried: "Knock him out, Jim; give it to
him."
Fitz jumped out of his chair, and look
ing up toward the place from which the
remark bad come, was about to say some
thing in reply.
"Don,'tget excited, Bob," said Julian.
"Keep your eyes on the fight."
The next moment Julian became ex
cited and, forgetting where he was. yelled
to Referee Siler to "get out of the way."
As the light went out and the announcer
told the crowd that there would be an in
terval of three minutes before the nnal
round was put on, somebody yelled
"speech."
Instantly the crowd burst into lond
cheerinp. When he could make himse f
heard the champion said in a clear voice:
"Ladies and gentlemen: Ever sinc9 the
fight at Carson I have heard ail sorts of
talk from Corbett about foul blows and
bow he was robbed of the fight. He has
said, 'Wait for the pictures and they'll
show how I made a monkey of Fitzsim
rnons.' Well, I've waited for them, and
yon yourselves can see who is the mon
eey. I forced the fight from the start and
I fought him fairly. I have not seen the
last round, which will be put on in a few
minntes, bat I'll bet $10,000 that the
World and Journal faked the pictures
which show me hitting foul.
"Corbett simply quit. You will be Able I
to say after the last round whether I won
fairly and whether it is my duty to fight
this fellow again. In the right he had the j
advantage of height and weight, -and!! ',
was handicapped with a broken thumb; I
yet I licked him, and licked him good." :;
v : These remarks were received : with tu
multuous applause, and *th n â >.. the I vera
scope man turned on the current. ; ; ,-; i' /
:â â '; "Now we'll see about this alleged foul (
blow," said Fitzsirumons. "Lack at these :

Why, he's gr ggy now. Here's whe.e i
Mil him on his solar plexus and he lores."
As Corbett began to sin Fi:z leaped
once 5 more to his v feet and rjcclai'med : â 
"See! I've moved away from him, and
his ' knees are | s'.iU off the floor./ I defy
anybody to say that I hit him when down.
He's sinking: slowly and I'm ten f.'etaway.

CINCINNATI, Ohio. May 24 âThere
has been for some time a great deal of
quarreling among the workmen of the
big Moerlein brewery. One man in par
ticular, named John Wolff, seemed to be
more quarrelsome than any of the
others. The foreman determined to stop
the bickering, and to-day, when Wolff was
making more noise than ever, the fore
manspoke to him sharply and ordered
him to shut up or leave the brewery.
Wolff did not say a word, but simply
turned away and began to climb the
step 3 leading to the roof of the big
building.
"Where are you going?" shouted the
foreman.
"Oh, I'm just going up to !ook at the
scenery," quietly replied Wolff.
The foreman said nothing more, and
thinking it the better plan to leave the
man to himself, thought no more of the
matter. Alter an hour had passed and
Wolff did not return tue lo reman began a
search. With several others he visited
tue roof and not seeing Wolff anywhere
they searched a big vat up ther-; and soon
found the body ot the unfortunate man.
His fellow-workmen say that Wolff was
a very sensitive man and tbat he had
drowned himself because the foreman
spoke sharply to him.

! Leave* for the International Convention
1 of (Snort Trneplar* nt Zurich,
CHICAGO, 111., May 24â Mrs. Otfaelia
Myhrman, delegate from Illinois to the
international convention of tha Inde
pendent Order of Good Templars, to be
held at Zurich, Switzerland, the weec of
Jane 15, left Chicago to-day for that
place. The attendants upon the inter
national, convention will comprise over
400 delegates, representing every country
throughout the civilized world.
Mrs. Myhrman is a prominent member
of the organization, and has made her in
fluence felt at past conventions by secur
ing the establishment of separate grand
lodges for the Scandinavian members of
the order in the States of Minnesota and
Massacnustt*, and it is her intention at
the coming gathering to endeavor, to se
cure a similar concession for the Scandina
vians of Illinois.
Although the policy of dividing tha
order in this manner has Deen strenu
ously opposed in the past, it is conceded
that the organization in the States named
has been more prosperous since the
recognition of the Scacdinavian element,
and it is probable tnat Mrs. Myhrman
wi 1 prevail in the present instance.

WORTHLESS LAND
Swindlers Unearthed by
Postal Inspector-
Flint. /
Have Bonded a Barren Tract
for Many Thousands of
Dollars.
The Debentures Rcaclly Disposed
of to Guileless Eastern
Speculators.
LOS ANGELES, Cal. May 24.âSouth
ern California lias sufered much in past
years by reason of the many land swin
dles that have been perpetrated upon con
fiding Easterners, anc. especially upon the
capitalists of Enrore. as soon as one
wildcat scheme is exposed another arises
to take its place. Postoffice Inspector
Flint is now wording upon a case that
promises some interesting revelations.
The inspector saic to-day:
"Ever since Qoeen Victoria has shown
an interest in th-j prevention of land frauds
in California I have taken particulas pains
to protect conf ding Britishers against tbe
wiles of the real estate swindler, and I
think I have run down one of the worst of
the many cliques which are separating
too credulous people from tbeir money.
"Up somewhere about Acton a company
that I am about ready to gather in is op
erating. 1 understand that it has issued
a lot of bouas based on t c ownership of a
fruit ranch, the interest and principal of
the debenture to be paid from the sales of
the crops. There are no crops. As far as
1 can learn they have a few acres of land
which was planted to trees ten years ago,
and ail of the trees died. I know that the
company has issued $124,000 worth of
bonds, and no one but the company's 'in
side man' knows bow much more has
been sold. The base of operations is in
an Eastern city and I hope to have the
chief officers under arrest in a few days. I
will make my report to-morrow."
In the meantime the prosecution of
Casey goes on before United States Com
missioner Van Dyke. This man is ac
cused of using the United States mail to
further the sale of some lands advertised
as located near Pasadena and valuable,
although as a matter of fact they were on
the steep slopes of a mountain and worth
less. His enterprise was a small one com
pared with the other.

Iruit-Qroxerrf' Union Adopt* Articles
of Incorporation.
VISALIA, Cal., May 24.â The perma
nent organization of the Visalia Fruit
growers' Union was effected this after
noon at a meeting in this city. Articles
of incorporation were read and adopted
and the papers will be forwarded to Sac
ramento to-morrow. The following fruit
growers were elected as directors for a
year: Thomas Jacob, B. C. Anderson, J.
Sub Johnson, B. F. Fennebaker, Ben L.
Maddox, George A. Fleming, W. Â±L Ham
mond, E. H. Miles and A. J. Buckman.
This movement is an important one for
this section of the Ban Joaqnin Valley.
Heretofore the local fruit interests have
been greatly endangered by loose meth
ods of disposing of the dried products.
The union proposes to receive, sell, pack
and otherwise control all kinds of dried
fruit for the mutual benefit of the erow
ers. Stock to the amount of $3700 has
been subscribed, and this represents a
crop this year estimated at 670 tons of
dried prunes and 250 tons of dried peaches.

CARSON, Nev., May 24.â The decision

The decree of the court is that the Union
Mill and Mining Company be given a

BROWNS VALLEY MINE DISASTER.
One Man Killed and Another Injured by
a Blast in the Donnebroge
Claim.
MARYSVILLE, Cal., May 24. âEd
Sherman, aged 28, a miner who arrived
recently from Nevada City, received inju
ries last night in the Donnebrogs mine in
Browns Valley which resulted in his death
an hour later. Sherman and a young
man named Shea had placed six blasts in
a stope on the 500-foot level and ignited
the fuse. Shaa took the lead in the re
treat and had reached a place of safety,
when he looked back to find that his
fellow-employe was not following. Sher
man s candle had gone out.
Thinking to guide his comrade Shea
turned back with his candle toward the
stope, but he had gone but a short dis
tance when the first blast exploded.
Nothing daunted, thou?h the concussion
had extinguished the flame of his candle,
Shea groped throneh the darkness to the
spot wherr Sherman lay prone upon the
eroumi. He was carrying the wounded
man out of the stope when the remaining
blasts went off in quick succession.
After reaching the surface Sherman
lived but an hour, death being due to in
ternal hemorrhages and laceration of the
bowels. One piece of rock entered Sher
man's back find passed through his body.
Sherman was a member of Court Gar
held, Foresters of America, at Nevada
City, to which place his body will be sent
for burial. Shea will recover, his greatest
injury being a wound in the calf of the
lee, where a piece ol quarts was found im
bedded in the mv clo next to the bone.
CA.RBOS JJA.'.K LOSES A BUIT.
Fails to Collect on an Amitjned Claim
From. Trtnmor Coffin.
CARsON, Key., May 24.â The case of
the Bullion Bank vs. the Union Mill and
Mining Company was to-day decided in
lavor of the defendant. It involved a
$25,000 claim for legal services. Some
months ago, w: en the Bullion Bank
changed hands, Trenmor Coffin was in
debt to tbe bank to the extent of $14,000.
The directors insisted on a settlement and
Coffiu assigned to the bank his fee in the
Union Mill and Mining Company case,
having been the attorney of the company.
His claim was presented to the company
by the bank, and payment was refused on
the grounds that Coffin bad agreed to con
duct the case for $3000 and had been paid
in full. This tbe company proved by sev
eral witnesses who were present when the
money was paid and the agreements
made.
The court decided that Coffin had already
received all that was due him for legal
services, gave a judgment for the defend
ant and assessed the costs of the case to
the Bullion Bank.
Mara Island Workmen Dinehargtd,
VALLEJO, Cal., May 24.â The con
tractors building the quay wall at Mare
Island have been notified that their men
shall work but eight bours a day instead
of ten hours as heretofore. The pay of
the men has been reduced to $1 75 a day
and they are obliged to patronize a board
ing-house owned by tbe contractors. As
soon as the reduction in hours was made
the seven or eight Vallejo workmen were
discharged, owing, it was claimed, to lack
of material. The men believe their dis
charge was a bit of spite work, as the agi
tation to reduce the working hours to eight
was brought about through the interces
sion of Vallejo people with their Repre
sentative in Congress, Hon. S. G. Hilborn.

CARSON. Nkv., May 24.â Wallace Mc-

started to run, dragging the boy behind.
After being dragged for some distance his
clothing was torn off and the rope slipped
off. He will die.

Stanford's Senior Class
Memorial Plate
Dedicated.
President Jordan Receives the
Tablet on Behalf of the
University.
Pleasures of Class Day Conclude
With a Dance In Encina
Gymnasium.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., May
24. â The class-day exercises of the gradu
ates of '97 were held in the chapel to-day,
attended by the seniors in a body aud by
their relatives and visitors. The exer
cises preceded the dedication of the class
plate, one of the most interesting of com
mencement week features.
Iv the introductory remarks Charles
Pope, president of the class, made men
tion of their many obligations to Stanford
University. He believed that as a whole
the class had done its best in university
work, and he hoped it would be missed in
college affairs after graduating.
The class history was read by H. Z. Os
borne Jr. The important victories of the
senior class were called to the attention of
the audience and some misapprehensions
concerning the class corrected.
Professor A. W. Smith delivered a part
ing address to the seniors in his usual
happy style. He pointed out the value of
a happy spirit and showed how it made
the burdens of liie easier to carry.
The sophomore cane presentation fol
lowed. The freshmen on attaining the
rank of sophomores, according to college
tradition, are entitled to the privilege of
carrying a cane. C. E. Schwartz, presi
dent of the sophomore class, made the
presentation speech. J. P. Rusk accepted
it on behalf of the freshmen. Both sides
enlivened the occasion by bits of pleas
antry, which were appreciated by the
audience.
The last will and testament was read by
R. J. O Neil. It abounded in local bits
and met witb applause. After the "class
will and testament" tbe audience assem
bled at tbe site of the new chapel to wit
ness the dedication of tbe memorial plate.
Jt consists of a slab of bronze set into tbe
cement walk. A similar memento had al
ready been left; by the class of '96. On
the bronze tablet is a '97 mart to designate
the author of the gift. H. C. Hazzard '97
delivered a neat dedication address. Each
class leaves traditions which become more
interesting as the years pass by.
Dr. Jordan resnonded on behalf of the
university. In substance he said:
"I am glad to receive the Stanford plate
of the class of 1897. It is my proudest
hope that I may be here to receive such a
gift from many a class to follow. In my
thoughts I can see tt is zigzag of bronze
tablets cornering one upon another in a
lengthening line; a line of gold on the
brown and gray of these cloister floors un
til the whole quadrangle is made brighter
by their presence."
Tbe graduating class gave a mot suc
cessful senior ball this evening in Eucina
gymnasium. About sixty couples were
present. The graduation ball, which is
considered the most important social
event of the year, called out Stanford's
most fashionable toilets.
The patronesses were: Mesdamos D. S.
Jordan, J. S. Btillman, 0. D. Man, A. W.
Smith, C. N. Little, E. 8. Baker, Gertrude
Piate, E. B. Wight, A. B. Rice, M. A.
Brantley, A. Morrison, the Missrs H. H.
Winslow and E. V. Dickinson.
The decorations of the gymnasium con
sisted of redwood bougbs from the moun
tains back of the campus, potted plants
and cut flowers.
The faculty committee met to-day and
decided the following members of tbe class
of '97 were entitled to diplomas next
Wednesday:

LOS ANGELES, Cal.. May 24.â A race
war is on in the Central Baptist Church in
this city. ; The s innocent cause of the
trouble are two little colored children, who
have been ; attending Sunday-school. A
committee of church members waited
upon the Rev. Mr. Copas, the pastor, and
demanded that negro children be excluded
from the "; Sunday-school. The pastor re
fused and was supported in his stand by a
portion of the congregation, but a number
of leading members demanded- their let
ters and left the church. The colored chil
dren are still attending school, though the
house is divided.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 24.â The dis

that corporation in the harbor fight is
proved by investigation to have been
groundless. There is no organized boy

Mission of the Students Now
Gathered at Pacific
Grove.
Will Labor for the Good of Their
Fallows In the Halls of
Learning.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., May 24.â
"Nothing succeeds like success" is a saw
as old as the most distant recollection of
the "oldest inhabitant." It has been veri
fied since the Students' conference held
its first session in this city among the
pines. As the work continues tbe interest
and attention of the delegates increase in
a remarkable degree. The work being
done by this convention is not only
thorough and substantial, but far-reach
ing in its effect upon student life on the
Pacific Coast.
The delegations from the principal in
stitutions, such as Stanford and the Univer
s'ty of California, have especial by enthu
siastic members, and the quiet of the town
is often suddenly rent by the vociferous
college yell of either or both of these rival
institutions. The Stanford-delegation cot
tage is adorned with a big white "S." on a
crimson field over the main door, and
almost all their fellows wear prominently
their college or fraternity colors.
To-day's session began with a short
preliminary business meeting. Then Rob
ert K. Lewis called together his training
class or the missionary institute confer
ence. The lecture was upon the head,
"Missionary Meetings in College Associa
tions." His topic was divided under the
following Heads:
First â Shall regular missionary meet
ings be held in colleee associations? Yes;
because the whole attitude of the college
on this subject â the life and power of the
association â depends upon missionary
zeal.
Second â Meetings should be held
monthly, because of the size and ignor
ance of the world, and the blight that
falls upon the associations if the meetings
be neglected. Mr. Lewis advised that the
young men and young women of coeduca
tional institutions hold joint meetings.
Third â Eow meetings are made effective.
Under this division, he advised care in
planning work by those who had it in
charge.
Fourth â How to get students to attend.
Make the meetings bright and attractive,
use attractive announcement posters and
invitations, and above all do not sins;
"Greenland's Icy Mountains" or any otner
stereotyped missionary hymn, was his ad
vice.
Two simultaneous meetings occurred at
9 o'clock. The one for colloge men in the
east chapel of the Methodist Episcopal
church was addressed by C. C. Michener.
From large experience in college work Mr.
Michener is fitted to give strong practical
talks, and his subject this morning â
"Work for the New Student" â was well
handled. The main point of his dis
course regarding the new student was that
he should be influenced in the hearty stu
dent fashion to enter the college Young
Men's Christian Association just as he
was influenced to enroll himself in a fra
ternity.
The other meeting was in the "Old Par
lor" and was for the City association dele
gates. F. L. Willis gave the talk to these
delegates upon "What Manner of Man
the Secretary or Paid Employes of City
Associations Should Be." He demon
strated in forcible words that the position
should be hiled by a man who was so
cially and physically, as well as educa
tionally, fitted to meet almost every class
of men upon an equal tooting, and that,
added to personal magnetism, he should
have strong, practical business qualifica
tions. He should be up to date in every
w ay, of economic and systematic habits,
and, above all, a personal worker and
leader among men.
Robert E. Lewis began the instruction
to the Bible class at 10 o'clock on the gen
eral theme, "Christ, the Soul-winner."
"The Conversion of Nicodemus" was the
first subhead of his talk, under which he
described the official position of Nicode
mus as a member of the Sanhedrim as
corresponding to that of joint officers â if
such were possible â of Supreme Justice
and Secretary of State of our American '
commonwealth. The second subhead
treated of the manner in which the con
version of this cultivated ana powerful
Jew was effected. Mr. Lewis cited as
another notable example of Christ's win
ning of souls the meeting and talk with
the woman of Samaria and her subse
quent conversion.
The recreation programme to-day in
cluded a trip around the seventeen-mile
drive, which the convention delegations
made en masse. The Pacific Improve
ment Company obligingly suspended its
rigidly enforced rule regarding wheeling
on the drive in favor of the college men,
and cave special permission for them to
ride their bicycles the entire length of
thai famous roadway.
Because of the coolness of the evening
atmosphere, the life-work class-meeting
was held in the west chapel of the M. E.
Church, instead of in the pine grove.
Robert E. Lewis of Chicago was the prin
cipal speaker, discoursing upon "The
Medical Missionary."
This profession, he showed, was one the
most needed in the missionary fiela, par
ticularly in China, in which great empire
there were fewer physicians than in the
city of Albany, N. Y.
F. L. Willis called the evening platform
meeting to order at 8 o'clock, and intro
duced the speaker of the evening, Dr. S.
H. Steele of Nashville, Term., president
of the Southern Division of the Epworth
Lekgue of the Methodist Episcopal
Church. Dr. Steele spoke at length upon
"The Hoiy Ghost," wiiich infinite subject
he dealt with wisely and carefully.
Drowned. Arar HUueillt.
RITZVILLE, Wash., May 24â Daniel
Sinclair, one of the most prominent cit
izens of Hi Jzville, was drowned yesterday
afternoon in Cow Greek. Sinclair, in
company with five young men, started for
a day's outing, their destination being
about twelve miles from town. Upon ar
riving at Cow Creek all went in bathing.
Sinclair, who could cot swim, waded out
a few yards from shore and accidentally
stepped into a deep pool. Before his com
panions could reach him he sank for the
last time.

BOYS ESCAPE FROM IONE.
Two Youths Break From the Reform
School, but Are Recaptured at
Stockton.
IONE, Cal., May 24.â The new superin
tendent of the Preston School of Industry
has made a number of radical changes in
the administration of that institution and
more will probably follow in the near
future, for ihe machinery of the establish
ment is not running so smoothly as the
new officer desires.

are the following: Head farmer, Thomas
Gartlin, vice C. Sibole; gardener, C. G.
Noble, vice Frank Dunlap; foreman of
tailor-shop, A. Heath, vice C. H. Mc-
Henry; captain and teacher. Company A,

On Thursday evening, as the t>oys were
marching in from the yard, four of them
broke from the ranKs and dashed past the
outside sentinel. One of the quartet fell
and sprained a knee, while another was
subsequently captured by the night
watchman, hut two others managed to
elude the officers sent out to find them.
Three of the boys confined in the re
formatory attempted to escape from the
basement on Friday afternoon, but were
captured and brought back. The same
day six others who were working in the
yard under Horticulturist Chris Tharsin
made a break for liberty, and beiore an
alarm could be given succeeded in making
their escape into the brush and are still at
large.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 24. â Police
Officer Carroll last night arrested John
Potter and Charles Bell, runaway boys

street and were attired in the uniform
of the reform school. Superintendent
O'Brien was notified by Chief Kingsbury
and will arrive to-morrow. Meanwhile
the youngsters are in jail.
SEA LION VISITS STOCKTON.
Swims Up From San Francisco Bay and
Makes Its Home in the San
Jottquin.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 24.â A sea lion
is said to be swimming in the waters of
the San Joaquin River, in this vicinity.
He was seen yesterday near the Garwoods
ferry bridge by four persons â L. A. At
wood, D. N. Lay, Mr. Manning and Mr.
Stockton. It is supposed that the am
phibian camo up the river in search of
fish, having found that the fresh-water
specimens were to his liking.
Some time ago two sea lions swam up
from the sea and paid Stockton a visit,
remaining for several days in McLeods
Lake. They frightened a number of boat
men who were not used to seeing the
amphibians in these waters. Numbers of
boating parties out on the channel put for
shore when they saw the noses of the
seals poking above the water.
Beveral times seals have followed the
river steamers until they left the bay, evi
dently intent on getting what was thrown
from the galley for food, and once two
years ago one followed a steamer for up
the river, apparently in a test of speed
with the vessel, for every time it stopped
the seal would do likewise, and then re
sume the race.
In the present instance the sea lion
apparently came up stream to seek new
quarters and food, and was not noticed by
the steamer men. It was seen by the gen
tlemen named, and is stiil disporting in
the waters of the San Joaquin.

Hundreds Visit
Sausalito.
Poolroom Operators Arrested
as Soon as Their Places
Are Opened.
After Their Release on Ball the
Illegitimate Qame Goes On
Without Interruption.
SAUSALITO, Cal., May 24. â The
threatened Invasion by the pool-sellers
took place to-day, and the poolrooms were
thrown open for business. The town au
thorities took immediate action, and ar
rests were made by Marshal John E.
Creed and Deputy Marshal Eugene
Creamer.
The firms which commenced operations
to-day were Harrison & Co. and Abraham
& Co. W. T. Barnett, representing the
first, and Zeke Abraham, for the other,
were arrested and brought before Re
corder Joseph H. Pryor snortly after
noon upon warrants issued upon com
plaint of Marshal Creed. The Marshal
alleged that within the corporate limits
of Sausalito thejdefendants willfully and
unlawfully received from him the sum of
$1 as a bet or hazard upon the result of a
certain horserace, in violation of the ordi
nance passed on September 3, 1894, pro
hibiting pool-sellinc Creed's ticket bears
the names ol the pame little horse John
nie McHale and the mare May Gallop.
Attorney Sylva holds the coupons as evi
dence.
The town authorities lost no time in
placing the principals under arrest, and
the result of the first race on which pools
were sold had hardly been announced be
fore the Marshal and bis deputy had Bar
nett and Abraham on their way to court.
The complaints were read to the de
fendant poolsellers, and they pleaded not
guilty and demanded jury trials. They
were released upon payment of $50 cash
bail each. They left the courtroom and
went back to the poolrooms, where they
continued business without further mo
lestation from the authorities.
This afternoon Recorder Pryor issued
two venires of fifty each and set the cases
for June 1 and 2. The serving of the *Ã¼b
penas upon the residents of Sau?alito to
be in court and act as jurors in the pool
room cases was commenced this after
noon. The names of those on the venire
represent the leading citizens of the town.
Recorder Pryor, following the example of
Judge Slack in the Fair will case in San
Francisco has said that he would listen to
no excuses except in open court, and the
excuses must be made in a voice loud
enough to be heard by all in court. Bench
warrants would be Issued to those failing
io answer to their names. Said Judge
Pryor:
"If the citizens are opposed to poolsell
ing in Sausalito let them inconvenience
themselves and come into court as they
should, and do their duty as jurors. In
these cases I do not desire to do more than
my duty. We have an ordinance against
poolstlling, and until this is repealed pool
sellers will be arrested."
The scene about the poolrooms to-day
was that usually witnessed in these ille
gitimate gambling hauuts, which are
thorns in the side of the legitimate racing
game. The crowd wai by no means small,
and many women mingled in the throng,
placing their money on the horses. Har
rison & Co. occnpy the rear portion of the
Buffa'o Hotel on Water street, and Abra
ham & Co. are doing business in the Bar
rios building, opposite the North Pacific
Coast Railroad Company's depot.
The business done by the poolmen must
of necessity be large as their expenses are
great. The Western Union Telegraph
Company exacts $100 for each day's ser
vice, and besides this outlay the wages of
employe?, rent and costs of defending
suits b considerable. Hundreds of the
"pikers" were in town during the day,
and they wore continually on the move
between the different resorts.
BOTEB OF 3HE TVJtJF.
Performances of California Hone* and
Jockey* on .Eastern Tracks,
Quite a nnmber of local track-followers trav
eled over the bay to Saiualito and took a shy
at the Eastern races. The poolrooms booked
on Si, Louis and Louisville tracks and it was
decidedly an ofTday, nearly all of the first and
second choices finishing a notch behind
where they were backed to land.
The winners at St. Louis were Benamela,
which started an 8 to 8 choice; Ben Frost, Dr.
Walmsley, Leader Ban, Cappy and Nicholas.
Young Garner, who rode at the local tracks a
year ago, then under contract for Dan Honlg,
seems to be in good form, as he piloted the
first named tDree winners. T. Murphy, who
was here early in the seat>on just closed, ex
perienced a rnn of hard luck, for, though
mounted on some "warm things" In the bet
ting, he could not manage to get one over
the line in front.
The gray horse Leader Ban, a 10 to 1 shot In
the rooms, was ridden by Slaughter, while
l)ora Wood, the Bto 5 favorite which finished
second, was piloted by little Jimmy Woods,
signed here by Barney Schreiber just previous
to nis departure East.
At Louisville the winners were: Rastus,
Fretful, Humbug, Roundelay and Elsie M.
Emulating the example of Garner at St. Louis,
Wiihite, who is looming up as a very promis
ing lightweight, landed the first three win
ning horses.
The pilgrimage East among the "left-over"
visiting turfmen and jockeys has become epi
demic, and ere a week has passed a turf not
able will be as scarce in these parts as a live
turkey on Thanksgiving morn. On the train
which pulled out of Oakland depot last even
ing departed Patpy Freeman and wife, 80l
Levy and Tom Qulnn bound for St. Louis. Joe
Summerfield and brother, the bookmakers, and
Jockey Piggon were also aboard, iTith Chicago
as their destination.
Edd!e Jones, who it at present without an
engagement with any of the big stables, will
leave to-night for St. Louis.
William Murry, with the Cambridge stable
string, starts for Saratoga this morning, and
Jockey Coady accompanies the portly Sacra
mento trainer. Bob Isom is also on the list for
an early leave-taking.
Clarence Waterhouse of the firm of Burns
<fc Waterhouse has gone to the country for a
ten days' fishing trip, after which he will
journey EÂ».it to watch the performances of the
stable's big string.
Green Morris put his horses aboard a car
last evening and started for Detroit. Jockey
Spencer, on the sick list nere for some time,
want along to do the riding. With a fair
chance the lad is the making of a good rider.
On Tuesday of last week, at the St. Louis
track, Barney Schreiber made a ''cutaway"
with a filly named Sorrow. Fickin? up 117
pounds, she was played to a standstill and
won very impressively from a clever field.
Report says that Flying Dutchman, Pat
Dunne's rare, good performer, has wintered
well, showing no sign of lameness, and prom
ises a return of his three-year-old form.
Pitt-burg Phil's Brooklyn handicap candi
date recently created a very favorable lm
pression at Morris Park by packing 126
pounds and being beaten only half a length
by Marry Prince, to which horse he was con
ceding nineteen pounds. The mile was reeled
off in 1 :42, considered a very fast race.
The long-standing dispute between Colonel
S. D. Bruce and tbe Jockey Club was settled
on May 18, the latter organisation paying
Colonel Bruce $35,000 for his equities in the
book.
The performance of Kitefoot in the Laureate
stake, decided at Morris Park on May 19 and
won by Frohman, was so good that tbe wise
ones predict Jockey-owner-trainer McCafferty
has another Winged Foot â a full sister to the
above named and a big winner last season.
Relentless Tommy Griffln was on deck again
at Louisville. On May 19 bis black horse The

winner a gentle boost of $900, the stable
coming back with the customary $5 bid.
Bnx, the chestnut colt by Imp. Order, re
cently ran a mile and a sixteenth over the
Newport track in 1:45^, within a quarter of a
second of the record, covered the mile from

navy-yard, has returned from Port Or
chard, where he investigated tho ground
ing of and damage to the battle-ship Ore
gon. His report will be forwarded to the
Secretary of the navy. Workmen who
went up to dock the Oregon say the dam
age was of a slight character â the inden
tation of a single plate where the huge
battle-ship rolled on the head of a pile.
The settling of the* dock amounted to
comparatively nothing.

at the instance of the Metropolitan that
Canterbury was brought from West

ropolitan further representing that it was
backing the new enterprise. Canterbury
was to have put $15,000 into the bank.
This he never did, and the only money
Invested was by Guthrie and Jocal men.

Colo. Within a week after his arrival at
Cripple Creek he was appointed receiver
for a failing bank there, the name of
which is unknown to his friend?, who
were apprised of the fact in a letter re

of an intimate acquaintance with Joseph
Bates, who is prominent in Colorado
financial circles. When made receiver for
the bank Clark's friends at Cripple Creek
were not aware of the circumstances
under which he left Bridgeport.

ELWELL DISCHARGED.
Prosecuting WltnesHeft Failed to Appear
Against tbe Dirlgo's Mate.
C. L E'.we'.l, mate of the Dirigo, ap
peared yesterday morning before United
States Commissioner Heacock for ex
amination on a charge of cruelty to sea
men. None ol tbe witnesses for the
proiecution appeared, and a continuance
was had until 2p. m. At that hour the
complainant and tne others were still
absent, and the Commissioner thereupon
dismissed tbe ca*e.
It is believed that the witnesses for the
prosecution were afraid they would jret into
trouble if they presented themselves, for
they had previously admitted that they
had broached a part of the cargo and ap
propriated some whisky from it. This is
a serious offense against the Federal
statutes, and tbe absence of the witnesses
is explained on that theory.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAT 15 1897.
FREE AGENCY
MUST CLOSE
Commissioner Fitzgerald to
Shut Down the Employ
ment Bureau.
The Legislature Did Not Pro
vide Money to Run That
Department
Allowances Made for the Support of
the State Bureau of Labor Statis
tics for the Next Two Years.
The statement was made yesterday by
Labor Commissioner Fitzeerald that the
free employment department of the State
Labor Bureau would be closed June L It
hat been maintained for two years on an
allowance of |2000 by the Btate Board of
Examiners and $1000 contributed by citi
zens of San Francisco. When other means
were required the Commissioner says he
put up the money himself.
The Legislature declined to approDriate
the money estimated to be necessary for
the maintainance of this particular de
partment. The Commissioner and his
chief deputy were atÃacramento last win
ter and begged hard for more money.
Many newspapers sustained tbem and a
man claiming to represent any number of
labor unions joined the Commissioner in
appealing to the law-makers for a lar*;e
allowance of public money. A very gen
eral impression that everybody about the
Labor Bureau was up to his neck in Dem
ocratic politics could not be eradicated
from the minds of the legislators, and iv
only the usual sum was allowed to run
the bureau.
The cold facts are that the Legislature
In the eeneral appropriation bill allowed
the following sums:
For salary o! tne Commlwloner of the Bu
reau of Labor Statistic!, $6000.
For salary of the Deputy Commissioner of
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, $3600.
For office rents Bureau of Labor Statistics,
$1200.
For salary of assistants, traveling and con
tingent expenses Bureau ol Labor Statistic*,
$7500.
Aside from the foregoing a deficiency
amounting to $5000 was allowed by the
State Board of Examiners and paid by
order of the Legislature.
ANOTHER ROUND ALLOWED.
Martin Kelly Gets a New Trial in His
Libel Suit Against W. B.
Hearst.
The Supreme Court has given Martin
Kelly a chance to get another whack at
W. R. Hearst, proprietor of the Examiner.
Kelly sued Hearst for $75,000 for slander.
The Examiner in general and specific
terms charged Kelly with purloining fire
engines and other portable property stored
at the corporation yard. The result was a
libel suit, and the department of the Su
perior Court in which the case was tried
decided against Kelly and put on him a
bill of costs amounting to $400. Kelly
asked for a new trial and Judge Dainger
lie.u granted it. Then Hearst appealed
from the judgment granting the new trial.
Following is the text of the decision
of the Supreme Court on Hearst's appeal:
Martin Kelly, Plaintiff and Respondent, vs.
William R. Hearst, Defendant and Appel
lant.
By the court. One of the grounds of the
plaintiff's motion for a new trial was the in
sufficiency of evidence to justify the verdict,
and the order granting; the motion was gen
eral in terms. Without inquiring Into the
propriety of the ruling as to the other grounds
It is sufficient tossy that under the evidence

What Manly Power Does.
It makes your life happy, because it makes you feel that the greatest of Nature's
gifts has been preserved by you.
It makes your nerves strong and gives you the sensation of true manhood. It
makes you a power among men, because they recognize in you a superior type
of man.
It is worth while being a strong man, because not one in ten is really and truly
free from the effects of habits formed In youth. :} \
The man who is lacking in vital force Is only half a man. He lacks confidence

WANTED ALL THE MONEY.
A Crank Visits the City Treasury and
Demands an Alleged Debt of
83,000,000.
James Doyle, a harmless crank who has
been wandering about the City Hall for
some time oast in search of some one to
pay him $3,000,000, which he claims the
City owes him, created some little excite
ment in the treasury yesterday morning
by demanding ail the money in the place.
He walked into the treasury and tossed
a paper ovor to Deputy Jacobs, who grew
pale in the face when he read a demand
for ?3,000,000. His voice was scarcely
audible as he asked his visitor to wait a
moment, and he hurried to call the polioe.
Doyle was taken into custody and before
Judge Belcher, who allowed him to go
free, his mind being clear on all subjects
except that ol the alleged debt of the City.
Sheriff WhMan, County Clerk Cnrry and
other City Hall officials have been both
ered by Doyle for several weeks past.

Supervisor Britt Gets E^n
for Being Tamed
Down.
A Resolution to Give All Their
Unemployed Relatives
Positions.
Democratic Committees Object to
Their Men Eeire Put Out of
Public Oifices.
Supervisor Britt, who was turned down
by the board at the last meeting when he
tried to stem the tide of changes that was
sweeping everythng before it, had some
fun at the eipente of his colleagues yes
terday, and while it did not restore any of
the decapitated jnes to their positions, it
gave the representative of the Ninth
A\ ard evident satisfaction.
For some tine past Supervisor Britt has
thought that some of the members of the
board were placing more relatives in posi
tions than they should, and has not been
slow to express his feelings on the sub
ject. When at the meeting of Monday,
the 17th inst., the family names of a num
ber of Supervisors appeared in the list of
BRITT'S SARCASTIC RESOLUTION.
Resolved, That all members of the Board of Supervisors whose
relatives have not already been provided for at the public crib be,
and they are hereby requested to send in a list of the names of
their unemployed relatives, so that the necessary steps may be
taken to provide for them; provided, however, that such Super
visors as may not have any unemployed relatives in the City may
be allowed sixty days' time to send over for them; and be it fur
ther
Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to Sen
tor Mulrooney.
appointees he was indignant and asked
one of the Supervisors why he did not
eend to the old country and get out his
remaining relatives.
When Mayor Phelan called for resolu
tions yesterday he handed in a resolution
that sent a broad grin around the board,
aud even the presiding officer had to
smile. It read as follows:
Resolved, That all members of the Board of
Supervisors whose relatives have not already
been provided for at the public crib beaudthey
are hereby requested to bend in a list of their
unemployed relatives so that tiie necessary
steps may betaken to provide for them; pro
vided, however, that such Supervisors as may
not have any unemployed relatives in this
city may be allowed sixty days' time to send
over for them; and be It further
Btsclvtd, That a copy of tnis resolution be
transmitted to Senator Mulrooney.
The resolution was solemnly referred to
tbe committee of tbe whole on motion of
Supervisor Smith.
In a communication to the. board City
and County Attorney Creswell suggested
that the City and County begin a new
action against tbe Sbiels Estate Company
to recover possession of certain property
in the Mission Creek and Channel street
district. ThÂ« City began suit in 1886
against 208 occupants of lands in that
vicinity and recovered possession. Shiels
was, by some oversight, lÂ«ft out of the liti
gation, and the property has since, through
the death, of Shiels. passed into tbe pos
session of the company that Mr. Creswell
desires to sue.
Mrs. K. Howard, past president of
James A. Garfield Woman's Relief Corps
No. 21, addressed the board on the subject
of removing Mrs. Ellen Morton's house
from its present location at Fremont and
Bryant streets. She stated that the only
petitioner for her removal was the firm of
Hobbs, Wall <fe Co., and that it would
work a great hardship on a soldier's
widow, 70 years old, if she were compelled
to move her home now.
Mrs. Howard asked that the board
postpone the matter until Septembei,
when Mrs. Morton will be able to move
her house.
The Grand Jury sent in a communica
tion recommending the adoption of the
plans which have been appointed by the
City Engineer for a sewer system in J
street and Eighth avenue, along J street,
Tenth avenue and I street to Twentieth
avenue; the sewer to be constructed as
Boon as possible. The matter was referred
to the Street Committee.
The Democratic General Committee of
the Thirty-eighth Assembly District sent
in a protest against the removal of Charles
Casassa, bridge tender, and Martin
O'Brien, janitor. Like action was taken
by the General Committee of the Thirty
pixrh Assembly Disir ct in the matter of
John Keily, janitor, and James McCor
mick, driver of a patrol-tvason.
The Supervisor from the Eleventh gave
notice that at the nexi meeting of the
board to consider the water question he
â would introduce a resolution to have the
waterof ail new hydrant* en"Cte.i bÃtween
June 30, l&'iT. and' July 1, 1898, delivered
free by the Spring Valley Water Com
pany.
Supervisor Smith stated that at the same
time he would offer sor.ia amendments to
tbe water rate -rhedule offerel by the
chairman ol the Water Committee.
Dr. Rottanzi's high hat ordinance was
finally passed.
A resolution was introduced by Super
visor Rottanzi calling attention to the In
ternational Postal Congress now in prog
gress in Washington, D. C, and authoriz
ing the Mayo.- to invite the deie?a;ei to
visit this City as guests of the munici
pality.
The resolution also called for a provision
in the next tax levy for the expenses of
the delegates' trip here.
The matter was referred to the Finance
Committee.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 25, 1897.
MAX GUMPEL IS
STILL THE STAR
The Handwriting Expert
Continues to Analyze
the Craven Will.
Attorney Foote Objects to Side
Remarks Being Made to
the Jury.
He Accuses Lawyer Mitchell of Unfair
ness and the Court Threatens to
Be S vere in Future.
Excitable Max Gumpel, the handwrit
ing expert, had the boards again yester
day throughout the session of the Fair-
Craven trial. It was direct examination
all day, too, but W. W. Foote will prob
ably cross-examine the expert some time
during to-day's proceedings.
The morning wore away tediously with
Gumpel and his microscope. He was
picking out letters and words here and
there in the disputed will and deeds, and
at the request of Attorney R. B. Mitchell
for the plaintiffs, analyzing them and en
deavoring to convince the court and jury
that they were possessed of defects indi
cating forgery.
For instance, he called attention to the
capital letter Fin Senator Fair's signa
ture and testified that the millionaire in
variably executed the cross on this letter
with a quick stroke of the pen. He said
that the same cross in the signatures to
the deeds and will have evidence of hav
ing been drawn slowly and of having been
subsequently retouched so as to bring out
the shaded lines.
Mr. Foote took occasion to remaric dur
ing the examination of Gumpel that tbe
expert must be in possession of a wonder
ful magnifying gla?s in order to see ail
the defects he was testifying to, and asued
Gumpel to get him a duplicate of it The
expert promised to do the best be could
to accommodate counsel.
When the afternoon session opened Mr.
Foote was granted permission to ask
Gumpel a few questions. He took the
witness to task for having testified that
one of bis reasons for declaring Senator
Fair's signature to the disputed deed to
be simulated was the existence therein of
a Roman "r" instead of an English "r,"
sucu as he claimed was a characteristic of
the millionaire's handwriting. The attor
ney handed Gumpel a bunch of letters
written at various times by Benator Fair
in his lifetime and admitted in evidence
as exemplars of his writing. The expert's
attention was called to a dozen or more
Roman "r's ' in these letters and he was
forced to admit that Senator Fair did not,
after all, adhere rigidly to one particular
method of forming the letters.
While this examination was going on
Mr. Mitchell precipitated something of a
rumpus by mumbling a remartc express
ive of ridicule concerning the importance
of the confession wrung from Gumpel by
Mr. Foote. It was loud enough for the
jury to hear it and Mr. Foote was on bia
feet in a twinkling with a stout protest.
"These people have been making com
plaints aboul me for making side remarks
in court and have even gone to the court
privately and spoken about it," said Mr.
Foote with warmth. ''They have been in
the habit of making side remarks them
selves right along. I made up my mind
that the next time they did it I would call
attention to it right out in open court and
not in urivate."
Mr. Mitchell protested that his remark
was harmless, He had only said to his
associate, Mr. Wheeler, that he could
knock out the apparent discrepancy in
Gumpd'a evidence in two minutes.
"There has been too much of this thiDg
going on in court," said Judge Slack
sharply. "I will announce now that if I
hear any more complaints I will take ac
tion that I think will stop it. I have tbe
rower and 1 propose to exercise it."
Everybody promised to ''be good" in the
future and the case proceeded.
Gunipel was shown a. lot of letters in
which Senator Fair used the Roman "r,"
but did not follow it with a comma as ihe
expert had testified constituted another
characteristic, Gumpel said that the Dar
ticular omissions that Mr. Foote called
attention to were exceptions to the rule.
He thought, however, that in nine cases
out of ten Senator Fair followed his "r's"
with a comma. It was a habit, he thought.
The direct examination was now re
sumed and Mr. Mitchell called for Gum
pel's opinion of the pencil will. The ex
pert said that in his opinion the will was
not a writing at all, but a "drawing." He
claimed to be able to detect evidences
that the word* had been pieced and
patched together. Tbe document he
thought, had been "drawn" with a soft
pencil. Besides, in his opinion, there
was no uniformity in the general appear
ance of tbe handwriting in ihe will. He
said ihe strokes of the letters leaned
toward the left in some places and to the
rip lit in others.
Â£Gumpei produced a memorandum from
his iuside pocset and was going to testify
with tbe aid of it regarding the number of
alleged retouching and piecing he said he
had discovered in the will when he exam
ined it last year. This was objected to by
the defense on the ground that If he were
the expert he posed as being he had no
rieht to give evidence from data. An ar
gument ensued in which counsel on both
sides quoted liberally from lawbooks.
The court finally ruled that Gumpel mu<t
The fae-simile y^ /**<* JF~ *â¢ on ever 7 wrapper
â  signature of (*ut&%7<&&44Ui of CASTOKIA.
depend upon his knowledge and memory
exclusively.
The expert then had to put his magni
fying glass into service and pick out the
so-called flaws one by one. Every time
he did so Mr. Foote insisted that the jury
be given an opportunity to examine the
original document instead of photographs
of it and see for themselves, with the aid
of a poweriul glass, whether or not what
Gumpel said were true.
The expert said he had made a particu
lar study of the word "bequeath" in the
will. It occurred about thirteen times in the
document, and each, he claimed, was a
counterpart of the other. His diagnosis of
this was that they bad all been traced
from an original copy. Gum pel was pre
paring to give some blackboard demon
strations in support of this statement
wnen the trial was adjourned over until
this m ornine.
THEY WILL YIELD.
Christian Endeavorerg Anxious to
Oblige the Presbyterian Pastors and
Give Up Sunday Rehearsals.
In tlie name of the Christian Endeav
orers A. M. Benham, chairman of the
muÃic committee, promised the members
of the Presbyterian Ministerial Union
yesterday to refrain from Sunday re
hearsals of music, "if the union is op
posed to praise services on Sunday the
Endeavorers will abandon them," said
Mr. Benham.
This olive branch was held oat in re-

sponse to the appeal of a committee ap
pointed last week by the union to inves
tigate the effects of music r<-bearsalÃ on
Sunday. Rev. C. E. Reynolds, chairman
of the committee, reported yesterday that
the music rehearsals, calling the young
people from all parts of the City, necessi
tated the use of cars on Sunday and hud
the effect of drawing the young people
away from their own churches.
Mr. Benham, wno had attended the
meeting of the Presbyterian Ministerial
Union to apeak to the subject, replied
that the Endeavorers had looked upon the
rehearsals as praise services, but if they
were displeasing to the union the young
people would discontinue them.
At the Congregational Ministers' Club
yesterday Rev.W. S. Ament, from Peking,
China, read a very interesting paper on
that country. Dr. Ament said he wanted
to eet together $10,000 to build a church in
Peking. A lady, he said, had already
given him $5000." Eie reported the Chris
tian Endeavorers to be in a flourishing
condition.
The Rev. A. S. Lawson of Amed mugger,
India, gave a glowing account of th? good
following Dr. Barrows' recent lecture In
that country.
The Bay Conference, which was to have
been held shortly after the Christian En
deavor Convention, has been postponed
until September.

DROWNED IN A TRAP.
Criminal Negligence Caused the Death
of Little Alexander Lind
strom.
Alexander Lindstrom, a blue-eyed baby
2 years old, lost his life yesterday fore
noon by falling into a dealhtraD left un
covered by workmen in a lot on De Haro
street, between Twenty- second and
Twenty-third.
Some other little children saw the baby
fail into the pool, but they were too young
and too small to save little Alexander
from drowninc. They ran and tohi the
child's mother what had happened. When
she arrived at the brink of ttie water hole
she saw the body of her baby lying at the
bottom.
The hole was made by neighbors who
have been wording on Sundays building a
house for one ol their number. There
was four feet of surface water in the well
and it was used for mixing mortar.
The child's death is due to the careless
ness of the workmen in leaving the well
uncovered and without any barrier to
keep children of the neighborhood from
falling into it.
Coroner Hawkins has taken charge of
the body and an inquest will be held.
ADULTERATED BRANDY.
Inspector Dockery Will Now Prosecute
the Manufacturers.
The adulterated brandy which Chief
Food Inspector Dockery quarantined last
Saturday was shipped for New York that
evening and is now speeding across the
continent. Naval Officer Irisb yesterday
wired the full history of the case to the
Secretary of the Treasury and explained
the importance of stopping the exporting
of the goods so far as the wine and brandy
makers of the State were concerned.
Inspector Dockery called upon United
States Attorney Foote yesterday and had
a talk with him and United Slates Mar
snai Baldwin. Tiiey informed Mr. Dock
ery that lie had no right to interfere with
the "poods" because they wero in posses
sion of the United States, having been
shipped by the Collector of the Port of
San Francisco to the Collector of the Port
at New York. On arriving at New York
they will be placed in a United States
bonded warehouse until the consent of the
Secretary of the Treasury is obtained for
their exportation. If sold in this country
the revenue tax would be $8000.
Mr. Dockery contends that when he
tapped the barrels there were no stamps,
marks or seals to show that tney were in
bond or in charge of the Government in
any way. He now proposes to prosecute
the manufacturers for violating the pure
food law.
BIBLE IN A NEW LIGHT.
Mn. Mountfonl'i Living Oriental Pic
tures an Indispensable aid to Iti
Interpretation.
Lydia yon Finkelstein Mountford is not
merely a Sunday-school speaker, nor are
her living pictures and her explanations
of them mere Sunday sermons. They are
object lessons in history far more vivid
than those painted by the flowing pen of
Macaulay, and lessons which are enjoyed
equally well by Jew, Mohammedan, Chri
stian and infidel. Sne is a pleasing speaker
in tne conversational vein, and the two
and a half hours of entertainment are al
most too brief. They seemed so last
night to the large audience which filled
Golden Gate Hail.
Wiih a company of twenty- five or thirty
men, women, boys and girls costumed in
the flowing robes of the Oriental people
Mrs. Mountford illustrated city life in
Jerusalem among the well-to-do classes.
An interesting revelation was that to the
effect that Leonardo da Vinci's famous
painting, "The Last Supper," is incorrect,
because the Savior and the Apostles are
represented as seated at an oblong table,
whereas at the present day and from time
immemorial the people of Jerusalem eat
and did eat "in the upper chamber,"
seated cross-legged at a round tableâ a
disk of metal supported on a trestle in the
center.
"The eye of the needle," which has been
so often quoted to the disparagement and
spiritual discomfort of the wealthy, was
shown to bo a small gate through which
camels were pushed and squeezed after
havine been divested of their saddles and
trappings.
"The wilderness" of St. John was ex
plained to be outside the gate of Jerusa
lem. He preached in the little towns and
villages, for all outside the wails was
called "tt>e wilderness."
The lecture threw a flood of light upon
the meaning of many of the most com
monly quoted sentences of the Bible.
Mrs. Mountford will lecture to-night on
"The Bedouins of the Desert."
FOOD COFFEE.
TEN DAYS
Without Coffee Makes Some Wonderful
Changes.
If the new X rays were used to photo
graph our own individual liver and stom
ach, we might be astonished and likely
frightened, if we had been suffering from
the use of coffee or tobacco. Coffee has
the same poisonous alkaloids as strych
nine, morphine, tobacco and whisky, and
its daily use, even in small quantities, is
the direct cause of that weak, dragging
feeling and the many troubles of stomach,
heart, liver and bowels. Tonics may
patch one up for a little time and make
one feel a little better. But what man,
with even a little plain common sense, but
sees that the only way to keep well is to
throw over the habit that causes the
trouble. Ten days' freedom from coffee
and ten days' use of Poatum Cereal coffee
will produce so radical a change toward
health and strength, that the facts become
plain to any one. Don't believe it, but try
it and judge lor yourself and then wonder
why you would daily submit to the old
physical discomforts week in and week
out. leading a most unpleasant existence,
when by a very little attention to the
breakfast beverage, one could ; ; be trans
ported back to the bounding health of
boyhood.
Postum grain : oaffee looks like old
Mocha, but everyone, children and all, can
drink Postum and digest it without
trouble.

JUST AT THIS SEASON.
Spring the Most Dangerous of the Year.
This is the most dangerous season of
the year. It may be pleasant, may often
seem attractive, but back of all the pleas
ant atmosphere there is danger! This
danger comes in some form of sickness.
Almost any sickness starts with a cold
or a chill caused by the sluggish action of
the system. That is why so many peo
ple just now complain of tired feelings,
pains in the muscles and bones, loss of
appetite, spring fever and similar troubles.
The following is good advice from a
prominent medical journal: "Pneumonia
and other daneerous complaints, which
result from a neglected cold, can always
be avoided if a timely remedy is taken.
When chilly sensations are felt they
should be stopped immediately or serious
consequences will follow. There is only
one way known to the world of avoiding
a cold or chills, and that is the use of a
good, pure, strong stiniulani. Nothing
ordinary will do. It must tee something
sure in its action and scientifically pre
pared. For this reason nothing has ever
equaled Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey,
which is acknowledged to-day by physi
cians and scientific men to be the only
pure medicinal whiskey on the market/ 1
Duffy's Pure Malt is always reliable
and effective. People should not, how
ever, permit any dealer to substitute
something which is claimed to be "just as
good" or "about the same thing."

Eastern people who object to the Benate
tariff bili because it raised the Dingley '
duties on citrus fruits and low-grade wools
and added a duty on hides are now as- |
serting that these changes were forced on
the Finance Committee by Senator Jones,
and if they can prove the fact the Senator
will not suffer any loss of repute as a pro
tectionist. The tariff must be made for
the industries of the whole country and
not for those of the East alone.
MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS.
~>Vhile there is much at Washington, in Cuba and in the Levant to interest the
' people of San Francisco, nothing which occurs in either of these places should lead
our c tzena to overlook or ignore the issues at home. We have to fight incessantly for
municipal improvements and against municipal scandals, and in this light, as well as
in that for liberty, there is needed eternal vigilance.
The activity of commercial and industrial organizations in this City has moved
' the Washington officials to take steps toward the immediate beginning of the work of
construction on the new Federal building, but in the meantime our local enterprise of
building a new Hall of Justice Jags, while the money lies idle in the City treasury
and industrious men are walking the streets in search of employment.
Many forms of municipal improvement are needed, and the Merchants' Associa
tion has outlined a worthy programme of work to accomplish them, but at the same
time there are evidences on all sides of the waste of public money in the routine
wort of administration. The taxpayers will with good reason object to further im
provements until they are assured the funds raised for them will not be wasted or
used for the en-ichment of ward politicians.
Large interests affecting aimost every industry of the State to a greater or less
degree are iuvolved in the tariff issue at the National capital, and much attention
must necessarily be given to the contest there, but there are issues nearer borne of
hardly less importance. An economical and progressive City government will be as
beneficial as a good tariff, and we must fight for the one as earnestly as lor the other.
Every good citizen desires to see Balboa avenue completed, our unemployed pro
vided with work on the new Federal building and the Hall of Justice, the programme
of improvements outlined by the Merchants' Association undertaken, the Mission
Park movement carried to speedy success, municipal extravagance checked and tne
administrative evils which have caused so many scandals in the past removed as far
as possible from our City government. We cannot, however, accomplish these things
by desires, no matter how intense the desires may be. We must work for them. We
must give our thoughts and our energies to the task.
The larger cities of the East are laying plans for extensive public works by way ol
preparing for the coming era of prosperity. In New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and
Boston the people are about to begin a series of enterprises which will materially
advance their welfare. It would be a profitable thing for us if we could keep up with
this movement of our sister cities, and it is certainly worth our while to study seriously
every department of municipal affairs, to see where we can make improvements, either
by spending more money or by checking the waste of money expended now.
THE TAEIPF DEBATE.
Few speeches have been waited for with
j more interest by the country at large than
j that with which Senator Aldrich is ex
pected to open the tariff debate to-day.
The revisions made in the Dineley bill by
his committee, while in some respects im
proving the measure, have not as a whole
been satisfactory to the peopie. It is not
the measure tne country expected from
such noted tariff experts and stanch pro
tectionists as are iho men who compose
the Republican party of the Finance Com
mittee, and it is therefore with no little
eagerness the people wait to hear the argu
ment that is to be advanced for it.
Mr. Dingley has, of course, abstained
from any extended criticisms on tbe
changes made in his bill by the Senators,
but he has pointed out briefly some serious
objections to them. The most notable of
these is the increase of duties on beer and
cigarettes, and the establishment of a
dutyxon tea, while lowering the duties on
high-grade wools, dried fruits and wine.
If more revenue were needed than the
Dingley bili provided, why lower the
duties which would have afforded protec
tion as well a3 revenue? If more revenue
were not neede.i why should we have a
duty on tea and beer?
It is difficult to understand how Sena
tors Aldrich, Morrill, Piatt of Connecticut
and Jones of Nevada were induced to con
sent to the proposed duty on tea. It af
fords no protection to any American in
dustry, and imposes on a necessary of life
a tax which wiil fall much heavier on the
poor than on the rich in proportion to
their means. All the revenue to be ex
pcc.ed from it could be raised much better
by restoring tha Dingley duties on dried
fruits, wines and the Higher class of wool.
There is in fact no need whatever to sacn
fice the principle of projection in order to
raise for the Government an income equal
to its expenditure.
Whatever Senator Aldrich and his col
leagues on the Finance Committee may
savin its defense, their bill is not at nil
likely to be accepted by the Senate in tLe
form in which it has been reported. The
antagonism of the people to the duty on
tea has already become so pronounced
that this feature of the measure is sure to
be removed. The question will then arise
as to the best means of making ap the
revenue which would have Deen derived
from the tea duties. On that point there
may be some differences of opinion. It is
not easy to see, however, how tbe West
ern argument for higher duties on fruits
and wines can be answered or ignored
when the question is considered, and it
would seem therefore that our battle for
protection to Californian industries is in a
fair way to be won by reason of the popu
lar opposition to the duty on tea.
THE OHIO ELECTION.
The press of tfie Eastern States is giv
ing no little attention to a consideration
j of the approaching State election in Ohio,
[ where the issues involved are not only the
| election of a Governor, but a United
I States Senator. It is known that tne
i Democrats will make every offort to carry
1 the State, and the outcome seems to be
regarded in some quarters as sufficiently
uncertain to render speculations concern
ing it of general interest.
It is difficult to see upon what grounds
the Democrats base their hopes of success.
The Republicans carried Ohio for McKin
ley last year by a plurality of 48,494 votes.
In the State contest they were even more
successful than in the Presidential vote,
and at present the Legislature stands 112
Republicans to 37 Democrats. It will cer
tainly take an immense change in public
sentiment to overturn such majorities as
these, and there is nothing in the present
situation to justify a belief that any such
change has taken place.
For many years there has been in Ohio
a strong factional fight in the Republican
ranks. These dissensions have not infre
quently led to Democratic successes, and
ai a result, almost ever since the close of
the war the Democrats have had one Sen
ator from Ohio, and at certain times they
had both. If there were any evidences of
a continuance of these factional disputes
this year, we could understand on what
! the Democrats were counting for suc
cess, but there is no such evidence to be
found in anything of recent occurrence in
Ohio politics.
The Republicans have determined to
make an early beginning of the campaign
and conventions have already been held
[in many counties. These have shown that
the oarty is well nieh unanimous in sup
porting Governor Hushnell for re-election
and Mark Hanna for the Senate. There has
baen no appearance of any decided opposi
tion in any county, *nd where the delegates
have not been instructed for Bushnell and
Hanna they have been left free to act as
they think best when the State conven
tion assembles.
While harmony Is thus well assured in
the Republican ranks there are abundant
manifestations of discord among the Dem
ocrats. The old fight between the silver
and the cold wings of the party remains to
be fought out. It is fair to assume the
silver wing will win, and the gold Demo
crats, therefore, will act with the Repub
lican party in the State election as they did j
in the Presidential contest Estimating
the vote on that basis there is every assur
ance tiiat the Republican victory will be
about as complete &s it was last year, and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 25, 1897.
that there will be no falling off in the
party vote beyond that which is to be ex
pected in off years.
While the Republicans are eaeer for the
fray, and have shown their earnestness
by providing for an early beginning of the
campaign, the Democrats are still hesitat
ing and doubtful. They have no strong
candidate either for the governorship or
the senatorship. At the present time it
appears probable that Paul R. Sorg will
be their candidate for Governor and John
R. McLean for the Senate, but neither of
these gentlemen ia likely to poll tbe full
party vote, and those who are looking for
I a Democratic victory in Ohio this year
must bs basing their conclusions on
somethine which they can read in the
| stars, for there is no evidence on earth to
sustain it.
INDEPENDENCE DAT.
Tbe interior part of the State is indus
triously laying fuses for the fourth of next
July. In scarcely any quarter no the ca'es
of local government or the stringencies of
bard timers diminish ttie lire of patriotism
wnich smolders there irom one year' a end
to another'sand splendors itsequ nox with
blue and red Ights and spires o; lire that
reach to heaven.
Only one voics is this season heard dis
affirming the glory of that yearly duv of
light and smokeâ voice down in Santa
j Ana uttering itself through the Herald to
aver that the sewer question thereabouts
is 100 engrossing to admit of interference
by any neeiless diversion. A "litlla
j thin,' 1 ke Independence day" is what the
I Herald calls it. It is obviously regrettable
, that this editor with a nose so violently
j uasddjctcd to sewer gas has suffered that
i triv a. part of him to obscure the sense of
! patriot sni which ought to lie behind it,
i but sucu seem 1 } to be the cold, impassive
| fact, expressed by him with a < â¢tndiou*
i calm ih v would fiecza ;ha feetoi a Boston
\ patriot. % i
By a singular coincidence the Santa Mon
ica Outlook rises todemand: "Shall we cele
brate the Fourth of July or shall we just
keep on listening to the kickers against
sewers?" Sewers seem to wield a peculiar
influence over the destinies of Independ
ence day celebrations this year. Is the
sewer a foe to the perpetuation of that
divine devotion to country which every
year wells up audibly into the throat of
I every man, woman or child who has a
â  heart deep enough to nurture a bubbling
spring of it? We should hope not. Let
the coupling of sewers and independence
in the same breath be hereafter tabooed,
else no one may tell what will come of it.
That celebration in San Jose is to be a
marvel of brilliance, unless the great
white light which is ' gathering for the
Fourth above Oakland shall succeed in
darkening it by comparison. With two
such fires rising on either side of San
Francisco to beacon the night of uncon
cern which shrouds her as the anniversary
ship comes speeding on, this City may
rind herself sufficiently well lighted for
the ship to see how to land when it
reaches here. Otherwise there might be a
capsize, for San Francisco's Fourth of
July fires are not burning very distinctly'
lim yet. "> . - 4 '. . r ,' - 4 ' . ,j â 
We rejoice to see the country preparing
for thi3 one hundred and twenty-first
birthday of American independence. The
country is always alive to these revered
bequests of the fathersâ these days of
BDecial festivity to recall the brave deed
of a hero, the noble innovation of a na
tion or the greatness of a statesman.
Even when their hurrying, crowding
metropolis is too busy to fittingly note
the annual recurrence of these various
red-letter days the juterior districts main
tain their ardent devotion to and enthusi
asm for them without abatement. It
would appear that the kind of patriotism
which people call "healthy patriotism" is
the kind that lives in the country.
THEY KEPT UP APPEARANCES
Chicago Times-Herald.
In the boom times a syndicate of Kansas
politicians started an Associated Press paper
up in a little town in Central Kansas. It was
a hummer, and for a time had all tne facilities
of a metropolitan journal. Then the funds
ran Bhorter and shorter. One fatal night they
gave out. Governor GMck was the president
of the paper's syndicate and he was tele
graphed to ior help. He refused and the force
waa left to get out the paper ai best they
could. The orders were to keep up appear
ances at any cost, and it was done. For sev
eral weeks the paper came out every morning
with a full page of telegraph news, not
a word of which was authentic The
Abilene Gazette had probably the most
varied service ever known on a pretentious
paper during that time. The foreman had a
file of the Cincinnati Enquirer a year or two
oIC, and the telegrams were taken from that
and dated on the day preceding at such places
as seemed best for the "telegraph editor."
Long tariff speeches were taken from the old
copies of tbe Congressional Record and the
country weeklies were robbed for happening*.
A r*in was good lor two columns of speciÃl
dispatches from a score of towns telling ot the
benefit to the cropÂ». People wrote in to say
that when the dispatches were sent the ground
was frozen two feet deep and larraers could
not have been "sowing oats" as siatedâ but it
made no difference. The Jarce wag kept up to
the end and many people never knew that for
weeks not a word had come over the wires.

ami will then rip up a heartfelt sieh as he
sadly exclaims: "And this was Brooklyn T'
For Brooklyn, to all mture intents and pur
poses, is no more. Swallowed np in the maw
of Greater New York, her identity is gone,
her insular pride crushed, her nanu is but a

about her ure scattered to the winds. Her

Whatever Brooklyn may do within the few
months that intervene ere the shackles ara

glory of New York. When thoue shackles are
iiriuly welded the spectacle of hosts of New
Yorkers swarming over the East River bridga
on Sunday, going to Brooklyn for their betr,

will govern both sides of the river, and the

AN ANCIENT CANTEEN.
Was Plowed Up on a New York Farm, and
NOW Ft'ZZLES THE ARCHjEOLOGISTS.
A very queer fossil rehc was recently turned
up by a plow on a larm in Tompklns County,
New York, soys the Popular Science News.
The whence and when must be determined,
If it can be at all, by the whatâ what it is. It
is five inches in one diameter, three in the
other, with wail about a quarter of an inch
thick, and it holds \\i pints oi water, the
round opening being between the lips. Ot
the usual material, reddish-brown color and
htr-lnens of earthen *.v are, it has a brilliant
glaze, which at once forbids Hie idea of Indian
origin. There is a semi-glaze on some pottery
relics in Guatemala only, so far as can be
ascertained. Several archseoloclsts have seen
this vessel, and can make nothing: of it; they
can merely suggest that some things of some
wheU similar styie hsvc been retcrred toearly
Spaniard settlers in the Soutb.
In the New York museum collections there
are faces on old Peruvian pottery (several with
broad nosewines, as in this), mm anno with
openings through the mouth, but with little
or no glaze. The- hair of tnls. lnio the Ci eases
representing which some whiting was rubbed
before photographing, iÂ« peculiar in arrange
ment and mar afford some hint of source and
date. Of course, it may be & freak of some
white man's po'tery, and of recent date; but,
if so, how came it to be inearthed, and on that
farm? Among; details that may be mentioned,
there Is black pigment baked into the sunken
corners of the eyes, and no attempt to repre
sent eyelids. â  â ' â 
Possibly the relic dates back to the early
Dutch settlers, who imported oddities in pot
tery; many of the Dutch, especially from New
Jersey, migrated to Western New -Yoric and
beyond. The hair arrangement! on this can
teen may perhaps favor this supposition.

Our relation to the A. O. F. has been of the
closest kind for the last fourteen years. Oar male
membership has always been and Is now coniiued
to members of the Ancient Order of Foresters in
good standing; in fact, onr prime object has at ail
times been "the advancement of the A. O. F.."
aDd more particularly the bubsidiary High Court
of the Pacific Coast. ... ... Â..-. Â° , â  ,
When the gpcess'on took place m 1889 we rallied
around Its standard and contributed not a little
to the success that followed, .turning defeat into
victory. -We believe we did right and feel proud
that right has won the day. Twice have we been
recognized as a "branch" of the A. O. F., first" In
| Detroit by the Subsidiary > High Court ot the
United States in the year 1885. and again by the
subsidiary High Court of the Pacific Coast in the
year 1889.' . -
In 1893 we applied to the High Court of the
World for its official recognition: this was unani
mously granted, on condition that we form into
courts. At a meeting of the s. H. C, of the Pacific
Coast held at Jo*e in the year 1893 the dele
gates voted unanimously against the advisability
of "female courts." The Companions of the For

tified the Hiph court of the World that under the
present, circumstances. In our ju gment, it would
not be for . the be.it < interests of ths a. o. F. upon
this coast should ,wa at < that time apply for dis
pensations to form into courts. Thus matters
rested until last June, when your present execu
tive board was notified by the seventh K. C. of the

with ihe requirements of the High Court of the

TOWBOATS AND
THEIR DUTIES
Learned Opinion by District
Judge Morrow on the f
Subject.
Of Great Interest to Owners ol j
Shipping in American ;,
Waters.
John D. 'Spreckels Bros Company Not
: Liable for Damages to th.Â» Mate
. of the Danielscn.
â â  <â  -' 'â  - - ri "S >'â¢- v;. V ." I â  = ' â¢'.
United States District Judge Morrow
yesterday delivered a.. learned opinion
which will be of great Interest to the own
ers of shipping and others. â .*
The action was a libel brought by Louis
A. Pederson against John D. Spreckels &
Bros. Company to recover $20,000 damages |
for the loss of one of Federson's' lego j
caused by the parting of a towline while
the company's tug Vigilant was towing
the schooner S. Danielson, of which Pe
derson was mate. i
Judgment, with coats, was given by
Judge Morrow in favor of the John D.
Spreckels & Bros. Company.
Pederson, the libelaht, was represented
by H. W. Hutton, and Samuel M. Short- j
ridge appeared for the John D. Spreckels
& Bros. Company.
District Judge Morrow's decision, which
is one of great importance to the towboat
interests of this coast, is as follows: â â¢ â
This is a libel in personam by Louis A. Poder- \
son to recover damages in the sum ol $20,000 I
from the John I). Spreckels & Bros. Company. !
The libelant was the mate of the schooner S.
Danielson. At the time of the accident, which
occurred on the morning of the 6th of August,
1895. the schooner was being towed in the !
waters of- the Santa Barbara Channel by the
tug Vigilant, owned by the respondent. ' The
towline was made last to the paiibitt and had j
been passed through the side or breast chock j
on the port bow. There were two chocks on I
the port bow, the torward and side or breast J
chock.. On the starboard side there, was only
one chock, the breast chock. What had be
tome of the forward chock or how it had been '
removed does not appear.
The libelant, as mate of the schooner, had j
himself supervised the manner of making the
towline fast to the schooner, and at the lime !
of the accident was standing between the bitt '
and the chock, on the inboard side of the tow- j
line, engaged in parceling the line. -The tow
ing had been going on for a short period of
time, variously estimated by the witnesses at I
from four to twenty minutes, when the -chock
through which the line had been passed broke j
or was carried away, and the liLelant was !
struck by trie line, thrown against the capstan â 
and his leg broxen. That limb was so severely â¢
injured that amputatiou was made necessary.- I
It is claimed on behalf of the libelant that I
the accident was caused by the negligence of
tnosein charge of the tugboat, in towing at
such an, excessive speed that the chock
through which the towline had been passed
was pulled in two, thereby causing . the tow
line to catch the libelant's leg and throw him
aguinst the capstan, resulting in the serious j
injury referred to. The respondent denies any â¢
negligence in towing at an excessive speed, |
and claims that the accicent was caused '
primarily by the contribute; negligence '-1 \
the libelant himself, to which the bad severing ;
or the part pi the schooner, as contended, also '
contributed.
'. The questions involved are purely of fact, '
and involve to a great degree, the credibility, \
01 the 11 nesses on both sides. Tee first <jues- I
lion it as to whether tho line was made fa>r
properly to th-i schooner by those on board of '
det who were acting under lbs mate's orders. ]
Evidence Â»vas iutro luced on behalf of the o- ;
apouuent lauding 10 snow that wneu a line is :
made fast to the paiibitt, mit was in the case |
at bur, it should be pawed through the for
ward - chock* , and 11 it is made last to tte i
wiiu!lass-biu it should be passed through the \
side or breast enoefc. " i
It is considered better seamanship to pursue j
this method lor the reason, that the lend wi.t j
be more straight end the strain on tho chock j
and the load itself less. la the case at bar, ns i
previously stated, 1 lie towline was passed |
through the breast chock and made fast to j
the pailbitt, which was not in accordance with j
good seamanship. As it was made fast to the 1
palibiit it should have passed through the â 
forward chock, or being placed through the
breast chock it should have been made last to
the windlass- pi it. Either one of these ways I
would have obviated the unequal and unnec- I
essary strain which results when tho line i'
pulsed through ana made fast as it â¢â¢vns in this
case. . . â -.>-â 
A3 this was done under the orders of the li
belant, who himself supervised making fast !
the vessel's end of the towline, it results that
if the carrying away or breaking away of tho
breast chuck was caused proximately by the
unequal and unnecessary strain j placed upon!
it, this would debar tue libelant from recover- |
ing any damages for his mjurias irom the re- |
spondent company tor the reason that he con- i
tributed to the accident and injury himself.
Aside from the fact thai the libelant person- j
ally directed how the towline snould be made :
fast to the schooner, it Is well settled that the I
tow is generally held responsible for. the man- I
agement of her end of the towline. As was !
said in The Merrimac, 2 Sawyer, 586. 17 Fed.
Cas. 126: "While in this case the tow hud her
master and crew on board, yet they bad nothing
to do with the navigation of either, vessel ex- I
cept to sleer the tow in the wake of the tug, |
to work her pump and handle her end ot the
towline." fcee, also, upon the general duties
of the tow, The Marparet, 5 Bis c - 353, 16 Fed.
Cas. 713; v. Hemmingway. 14 Pick. 1; j
the Ci.tmpa Emilia, 46 Fed. R. 866; the Jacob
Brandnw, 39 Fed. R. 831; the Invertrostachs, !
etc., 59 Fed. R. 194.
'I' am convinced from the evidence that the !
manner in which the towline was made fast 1
and passed through the breast chock on the I
schooner was what caused the unequal, strain ]
on the chock and carried it away. g it is, how
ever strenuously contended by counsel lor the j
libelant that the efficient and proximate cause j
of the breaking or carrying away of the breast '
chock was - the ' excessive speed at which the i
tug was towing the schooner. Testimony was '
introduced in support of this contention tend- I
ing to show mat the tug was going at the rate j
of nine to ten miles an hour, and that this i
speed under the circumstances.was excessive,
and caused the breaking of the chock.
This testimony, however, is , flatly contra
dicted by witnesses on / behalf of the re
spondent, whose testimony strongly tends to
show that the tug was going no faster than !
six or seven miles an hour, and that this rate, I
under the conditions , of weather then prevail
ing, -..-as reasonable and proper.- Tho weather
was caini and pleasant, he water smooth. The
schooner's register was 87 tons gross, 83 tons
net. 91.9 leet in length, 27.6 feet in breadth i
and 6.8 feet in depth. On this particular oc
casion she carried 5 tons of iron. She was
â¢bout ten * years old. -.Whether or not there
was anything faulty about the chock itself
does not appear from the , evidence. . It seems
however, that the . forward chock on the star
board dow was gone.: When this happened or
what ; caused its disappearance does not ap
pear. Upon the whole of the evidence pre
sented on this point I am inclined to accept
the testimony of the witnesses for the re
spondent as being more reliable and accurate, i
â â¢It is true that there are some, discrepancies
and contradictions in the testimony, but upon
the whole of the evidence I come to the con
clusion that the tug was going not more than
seven miles an hour, ana that this, under the
circumstances then prevailing, was not Â«n un
reasonable and improper rate of speed, and
was not the proximate cause of the breaking
S.Â« the breast chock. It is further claimed by
respondent that bad steering by the captain I
01 the schooner, who was.in charge of the
helm, contributed to the breaking of thechock
by increasing the strain thereon;-/ But how
ever that may be, I am satisfied that the acci
dent was due, for the most part, to the manner
in which the ; line was passed through : the
breast chock and made fast 10 pnllbitt. -...â 
â¦ ihf-re is :io question as to tha sufficiency or
stability of the , rope. ,'.To } whom it belonged,
whether to the- schooner or.to the California
Iron and Wrecking Company, is not entirely
â¦Iei c /}; 5?) one ' thin S ls certain, and that is
tnatitdid not belong >to the tug. It s was a
new rope having been used â¢ but a : few times
before thu occasion. It 1 broke some * fifteen
minutes after the ! accident which befell the
libelant: Counsel for claims that
this indicates that the tug was going at an
excessive speed, for th* reason that a new rope
would not break unies3 | the i strain I upon it
were of an extraordinary nature. But there
is = testimony whicn tend* to show that the
rope after the choc* broke was ! subjected to
chafing and that its breaking was caused by
this fact and not from any great or exlraordl-
I nary^trai placed upon it by towing at an
lexceKsiveioepd.f ... . â  .â¢ â  . . .
Counsel "or libelant has cited many cases to
support hi; contentions. fail, however, to
see how aiif of tuein ' can be deemed applica
ble to the ffcts of this case. There can be no
question ab*ut the general principles applica
ble to the cans at, bar,' In the ; first place, it is
well settled ;\at tugs engaged in towing ves
sels are not tr-mtnon carriers; that they are
not insurers/ iui are' bound slmtdy to use or
dinary care am skill in towing, (The Webb,
14 Wall. 406; "he Margaret. 96 C. 8. 494.) In
the second plnif , the burden is cast upon the
libelant to shot, by a fair preponderance of
evidence, that tie respondent has been guilty
of negligence wijch proximateiy caused the
accident and in.ury to libelant. (Shearm. &
Redf. on Keg., Sol 14.) No presumption of
negligence can fatly be said to arisa in this
case from the men met that the libelant was
injured. \: Â®*JW
This is not a ctseVhere it can fairly be pre
dicted from the evidence that the thing which
caused the injury to libelant was under tne
management or exclusive control of the re
spondent, bringing toe case, within the rule
laid down in B/rne-vs.-Boadle, 2 Hurl, and
Colt., -721; â â  Scott v-. Lon-ion Dock Con,.
pany, 3 'Hurl. 'â¢ and Col., '596, 601; Kearny

Howser vs. C. ui:Â«i P. R.R. Co.. 80 Md., 14;
Dixon vs. Plums, 93 Cal., 384-389. The acci
dent and injury took place on board tho
schooner and not on the tug: the towiine wai
furnished by the. teasel Â«.nd not by the tug.
and it was made under the directions tnd
' personal snpervisiomoi the libelont. the mate
1 oi the schooner, and not by virtue of any or
der, supervision or advice from those having
charge of the tug. Upon the entire evidence
la the case 1 am 01 the opinion that the libel
ant has failed to pro*e by a lair preponder
ance of evidence thai the towing of the
schooner by the tug Vigilant was negligent,
and was the efficient, proximate cause of tha
accident and injury which befell the libelant
Tne libel will be dismissed with costs.

Governor Budd arrived from Sacra
i mento last night. To-day be will lend his
i ear to the attorneys for Dnrrant. The
! Governor has definitely decided that he
! will not allow Durrant a personal inter
| view. Any application or statement from
I the condemned man will be presented
through his attorneys.
The Governor hopes to reach a decision
in the case not later than Friday. Al
ready he has reviewed the entire case, for
the prosecution, and what he hears to-day
will be much in the nature of rebuttal.
Great pressure is being brought to bear
upon him to allow Mrs. Durrant to make
an appeal in person in behalf of her son.
Chief Lees called at the hotel last night,
i but failed to see tha Governor. The two
will have a conference this morning.

I had called to my attention this morning

' him insane, and from subsequent letters sent
I to me by him I hai m? opinion verified, also
i by his acts after his dismissal by me. winch, if
you desire, 1 vfill give you in detail. I send
you this communication to repudiate any
claim he may m.Â»kc with reference to his san
ity, for he undoubtedly was insane.
Detective Ed Gibson, according to in
structions from Chief Lees, saw Dr. Dear
dorff, 1-4 Grant avenue, yesterday. He
I told Gibson that about a year ago Mrs.
: Schwartzier name to his office and pave
the name of Miss Winters and asKed per
â  mission to use his office two hours a day.
i She told him 3he had patients in San
| Jose, Alameda and Sacramento and in
j this City ana wanted a place to receive
j them and that she would throw other
| business in his way. She only used his
| office a few days and he found out that
â  she was a criminal practitioner. He iv-
I tended to te!i her to stop coming to'the
j office when he found this out, but she was
I only there a few days and did not come j
| back 'icain. She told him or. one occasion (
j that Durrani wasiniiocent;] that Â«he knew
it. They only locked horns on the subject j
once. He told her he believe<l D.irram 1

â  coarse to that pursued by Attorney Tit bb
j She has already called upon several of th*<
] vritr.eises, among them Mrs. Vopel of 9193' i
1 Powell street.
j Mr . Voc^l railed upon Chief Lees yes
j terday afternoon and made the following
j statement:
j Mrs. Martin called last Friday nfternoon be
-1 tween '.he boars of 3 and 4 o'clock. She .told
' me she sÂ»w a m*j in a. concert liall who
â  looked so exactly like Durrani that she fainted
a\~Â»y, the resemblance was s â¢ Close. Sue !
wanted to know ll 1 had not made same mis
, take 1 said that I had made no mistake; that
I 1 saw Durrant and inquired into all the par-
I ticulars as to where 1 wan sitting in the win
dow, what I was sewing and all about the
; case She said to me thai oho did not want an
innocent man nanged and that she would
| move heaven and earth to free Durrant. Then I
; she went away. She returned again in about
i a quarter of fin hour nfterward and a gentle
man came wltii her They called to see if I
; had not mode some mistake in my testimony.
i Tiie man was ver- pule and had dark eyei
I and gray hair. She took two envelopes ou tof
â¢ my box and asked me foi a lead pencil and
j she wrote down everything I said. She did
{ not show me what she wrote, or read it to me,
I nor did I sigu it. I tell you this now so that
you will know all about It.
â The gentleman told me he was in Alaska
. [ during the lime of the Durrant case and tola
me he whs very much interested in* it, and
â  pointed to a map which I had to some island
; in Alaska where he baa been. Then they
i went off. On Saturday afternoon they called
I again. I saw them coining and went down to
the back yard and Vogel went to the door.
They told my husband tuat I invited them to
I come; that I told them to come again; that
i The gentleman who was with her wanted to
â  find out all the particulars (it was the same
man who had been there before). My husband
: told them I was not in and would not be home
and they went away. 1 am sure they wanted
to catch mo with something. I told them just
exactly the samo that I told you and not a
word different, and tell you this before they
do anything about it so you will know what
happened.
Mr?. Martin attracted considerable at
; tention by her conduct at the Emmanuel
j Baptist Church last Sunday. She occu
! pied a seat in the front row and after the
services she . interviewed several of the
members who were present. Amone those
j she accosted were Mrs. Leek and Miss
I Wolf. Upon seeing Officer Robinson in
! the church Mrs. Martin hastily departed.
Henceforth officers will be present at all
the services of the church. ; "We will have
officers there to keep these cranks from
| causing any trouble," said one of the trus
i tees last evening. "If they come to the
church and try to raise a disturbance they
will be ejected quite unceremoniously." :
The opinion among the members of the
Emmanuel Church seems to be that Rev.
Dr. Gibson will consent to remain as pas
tor of the church. While he has said
| nothing since the action of the trustees in
efu3iriÃ to accept his resignation, it is
i nought that since tin return of Secretary
i Lynch he has become less unwilling tore-
I main.. .
In regard to a current rumor that ex-
I ception would be made to the decision in
i the Lamont case on the score of onÂ« juror
j having admitted before being .-â¢ sworn that
I he had a prejudice, Chief Lees said last
night that he had nothing to add to the
reports of the trial. In the newspapers of
August 30, 1895, it would be found that
this particular talesman bad merely stated
that he had an "impression," but that it
would not affect his judgment. He was
accordingly passed as beinz entirely
eligible within the meaning of the law.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 25, 1897.
RAISED A FALSE
CRY OF FIRE
Children in the Hearst
Grammar School in
a Panic.
The Presence of ; Mind of > the
Teachers Prevented a
i Stampede.
0
Two Boys Who Maliciously Raised
tic Cry Severely Lectured and
S ntenced by Jvrge Campb 11.
The presence of. mind of Mrs. Nettie A.
Wood, principal, and the other teachers
in the Hearst Grammar School, Hermann
and Fillmore streets, prevented a
stampede of the schoolchildren about two |
weeks aso and probably saved a number |
of them from being trampled to death, as
there are 760 pupils in the school.
The facia m the case came out in Judge
Campbell's court yesterday, when throe
boys appeared before him to answer a
charge of disturbing the peace. The boys
were Frank Perrell, 17 years of age, and
Thomas Kirby and Willie Donlan, both
about 12 years of age, who live in the
vicinity ot the school.
The evidence showed that Donlan had
nothing to do with the case, and the"
charge against him was dismissed. Per
rell was sentenced to six months in the
County Jail and Kirby was seat to the
Boys' and Girls' Aid Society.
Peirell conceived . the idea of having I
some fun at the expense of the teachers i
and children in the school and he induced i
Kirby to join him in the scheme. Ttre !
scheme was for Kirbv to run into thÂ« j
school shouting "Fire! lire 1 the school's \
on" lire!" and Perrell was to join in the i
cry from the outside.
The scheme was carried into effect on !
the morning of May 13. when the children :
were busy at their lessons. Kirby, as ar
ranged, ran into the school and yelled
"Fire! fire! the school's on lire!" and a
voice outside was heard repeating the cry. I
Kirby immediately ran out and joined |
Perrell, and 'he :wo waited in a conven
ient spot to see the excited children come
tumbling out, but they were disappointed. i
When the cry of fire, was heard i there
was a panic among the children and they
jumped to their feet. Instantly the voices
of the principal and teachers were heard
commanding them to take their seats and
tile benefit of the firo drill was seen by
the children promptly obeying the com
mand, although some of the younger ones
showed some reluctance in doing so and
looked as if they would prefer to rush out
of doors.
A hasty examination showed no sign of
fire or smoke and then it dawned upon the
teachers that a malicious jose had been
played upon them. N*xt day a com
plaint was svrorn to charging the boys
with disturbing the peace and they were
arrested.
Judi:e Campbell in sentencing Perrell i
| lectured him severely upon the heinous \
I nature of his conduct and told binnf it i
| had not been for the presence of mind of â¢
I the teachers he michi iiava been the cause I
j of several children losing their lives in a j
I mad rush for the. door?. Then he would
: have been charge cl with murder. He also ;
; talked severely to young Kirby an 1 both <
j boys expressed their contrition.
"NAT" IS HIMSELF AGAIN
Returns to H'.s Nat.ye Heath
in ''An Anier caa
Citizen."
M7ra Horetta is a Chasm n; Martha
fit the T.vo i â Irish
Co cert.
After Nat Goodwin's recent incursions
Into costume comedies at the Baldwin it
was refreshing to see him last night clothed
a^ain in modern dress and in his right
mind as "An American Citizen." Good-
I win's talent essentially lies in the por
trayal ot certain types of modern Ameri
can character, and Madeline Lucette
Ryley's play affords him an excellent op
portunity to shine in the field where he is
most at home. '
The chief change in the cast since the
first production was the substitution of
Miss Hattie Russell for Miss Emily Mel
ville as Lady Bunn. Miss Russell.who
hes some of her sister's (Ada Reaanj
dignity, played the rolo effectively. The
rest of the cast was good, and the staging,
particularly in the carnival scene, was
picturesque. , -7 .
On Saturday nieht Goodwin will say
farewell with a bill containing several
novel features.
At the Orpheum.
There were four new acts on at the Orpheum
last evening, and not one ot them seemed to
make a genuine Orpheum hit. Net that they
were poor by any means, but the crowd lacked
enthusiasm. Little Anna Laueblin did her
best work in her imitation of Mrs. Leslie Car
ter in the "Heart of Maryland." Miss Laugh
lin is one of the cleverest child actresses now
before the public. Mile. Omene, a veritable
female Herrmann, did Â£ome exceedingly clever
tricks. The costuming of both Mile. Oraone
and her assistant could, however, bo im
proved without hurting the performance.
The Eclair Brothers do a specialty entitled
'â¢The Crocodile and the Demon." Both gen
tlemen are clever contortionists and do their
work well. Jules and Ella Garrison, travesty
artists, do the siime act they did here some
time ago. The Osrani Pantomime Company
has been put down to the last of the bill, and
it is to be sincerely hoped that this is its la3t
wetk.
Alcazar Theater.
Francis Powers' Chinese play still crowds the
Alcazar Theater, and it is safe to say that it
will continue to do so for the next two or three
weeks. The Alcazar people are proud of their
actor -author and are doing everything in their
power to make his benefit Friday evening an
unusually biff, success.
"The Three Hais," a farcical comedy in
three acts, precedes "The First Born." It
stp.rts off very much like "The Arabian
Nights," but the resemblance ends there.
George Osbournc is Sam Selwyti, a married
mar., does an effective piece of comedy work.
Francis Baker, a clever character, makes the
most of his part as a teacher of penmanship.
Juliet Cro*by and Gertrude Tidball play two
pretty little ingenue parts, and Adelu Bel
garde, the practical w le of Sam Selwyn, ap
pears to advantage. The rest of the parts are
well cast.
Ttvoll Opera-Housa.
An exceptionally good revival of "Martha"
was given at the Tivoll last night. Dainiy
little Myra Morella made a winsome Martha,
and sang her lines charmingly; Bern ice
Holmes was an effective Saticy; John J. Raf
iael was good as Plunkett, and Rhys Thomas
san* well as Lionel. The spinning scene be
tween these lour principals was an exception
ally pretty bit of tLCtiug and singing.
Maurice Darcy raado a good deal of the sher
iff's role, ana the choruses, particularly in the
market scene, were good.
Irish Concert.
An interesting evening ol Irish songs,
legends and recitations will be Riven this
evening at the new Sherman & Clay Hall by
Dennis O'Sullivan and Daniel O'Coimcil.

The steamers Humboldt and Pomona
had another trial of speed yesterday. On
the last occasion the Humboldt won the
contest, and ii she keeps up the clip she

see the steamers off, and at least $1000

of tns Bow head Ins been a varied one.
She was built to the order of A. M. Simp
i son ana is the only vessel ailo.u that has
j a redwood deck. It was an experiment
i and the result has been more than satis- '
! factory, but the expenseâ well, that is !
I another story. The Bowhead was built I
j for a tugboat and as such served for sev- j
I eral years on Coos Bay. One day her j
' boiler burst and the vessel was almost j
I wrecked. After Iving at anchor for years
she was sold to W. Bendt and others and. I
turned into a sealing schooner. For two
seasons she did not pay exnenses, and for j
two years was laid up in Oakland Creek.
Now she has been brought out of retire
ment and will go into active ttervice in the
i Arctic.
The schooner Eivenia is to go into com
mission again rte-pite all stories to the
contrary. While lumber ladtn she went!
ashore from her moorings and did consid- j
erable damage to her bottom. (She was
| towed here in a water- logged condition,
| and after the deckload was discharged off
i Meigga wharf, was towed to Oakland
Creek and run high and dry on the sand.
The lumber was taken out and W. Camp
bell and others bought the hull for a song. |
It was towed over yesterday and will go
on the drydock to-day, and the new own
ers say that the Eivenia will be in the
lumber trade again before the month is |

The Harbor Commissioners held a short

on behalf of Branch 167 of the National
| Labor Exchange and asked that space be
set aside in the new market for fifty-four, |
branches of the organization which he j
r represents. The members of the ex
change do not believe in money as a legal
tender, but each man is paid "in ex
change" according to ; the work "he : does.
object of the space is to get rid of the
surplus products of the Labor Exchange.
iA. Rowley of the titate Board of Trade
also wanted to know something about the
free market. According to - him the plan
is not feasible, but still he wanted to meet
the farmers and see what was to be done.
i Commissioner Co! noa said nothing could |
be done until the farmers ; were - heard 1
irom and that would not be before Thurs
day afternoon. ' : ' .-'-'. v;."

grewsome sight yesterday. The partly de- j
composed body of a man went floating
past on the ebb tide. A boat was sent j
out to recover the remains, but they could
not be found and are now probably over
the bar and lost forever.
The strel snip Dingo has lost her charter
on account of her long trip. Bhe was to
have cone to Honolulu to load sugar for
New York, but now the bargain is off ana
the chances are that she will hare to join
the idle fleet in Sausalito.
No work was done on the British ships
in port yesterday. All the men had a holi
day and all the vessels were decked with
bunting la honor of the Queen's birthday.
The Britisn ship Stronsa will n ave to go
to Portland to load wheat. Owing to a
misunderstanding she came here and the
charterers refused to handle her. Now
she must return to Portland and take in
her cargo there. *
Wayne Harris, the runaway boy, was
located on the British ship Glencairn yes
terday by Officer Shaw and returned to bis
parents at i i: e Hotel Avoudale. The
14-year-old lad was at work in the ship's
galley peeiine potatoes when arrested.
The sky above the bay was brilliantly
illuminated by vagrant shafts of iijrht last
night. The searchlights of the Monad
nock, Monterey and Benniogton were be
ing tried ana there was just enough mist
over the water to make the piercing rays
exceedingly effective. The cloud*, shore
points and principal features of the City
were successively lit up by the weird
white gleams and the spectacle was ad
mired by thousands of citizen*.
SIX SUSPECTS ARRESTED.
The Police Hare Gathered In Men
Who Are Supposed to Be
Tlll-Tappers.
There are now six men detained in the
tanks of the City Prison on suspicion of
having robbed the till of the stationery
store at 118 Taylor street last week.
That deed was a particularly desperate
one, in which the thieves held up the pro
prietor of the place at the point of a re-
volver. However, this robbery is but one
of the same kind in many that have a 1
the earmarns of having been committed
by tne same pan>;,
Oi Saturday three hangers-on in the
tenderloin were brousht in by Officer
O'Lva and posse, and yesterday tnree
0 h'.-ra, giving the names of Clarse, Mc-
B roy and Sul.ivan, were taken from
Market and Ellis streets, where they make
1 heir rendezvous. Officers Ellla and Bun
iir believe that these are the till-tappers,
anil are hoidinsr tnem for identification.
CIGARETTE LAW SCORED.
D:aiers Dec are Such Measures
Do the City Much
Harm.
They Believ." th.- Pioposed Ordinance
VV.uid Be Decided Invalid b7
the Ciur's.
Tobacconists all over the City laugh at
the proposed law to make it a crime to
sell or give away cigarettes, and they as
sume, first, that it wili not be passed and,
next, that it will be declared unconstitu
tional if it should be enacted. In any
event, they do not expect that should it
pass there will be any serious attempt to
enforce it.
The following expressions of opinion by
well-known local dealers in cigars and
tobacco give an idea of the general senti
ment:
M. A. Gunst & Co.â We deal chiefly in
cigars ana care very little for the cigar
ette trade, but the attempt to pass such
a ridiculous law is a silly thing. This is
the wrons City and Wie wrong generation
for peonle to try experiments suitable for
the dark ages or for puritancal countries.
American Tobacco Company â It is
ridiculous to try to pass such laws in a
frpÂ» country.
Michaliischke Bros. & Co. â We have no
fear. If they pass such laws it will be in
order next to fine a man for kissing his
wife on Sunday, as they did under the
old "Dlue laws" of the New England
States. The attempts of cranks to pasa
such laws give the Ci;y a bad name. The
law would be unconstitutional anyhow.
M. N. riirsclj â It is a ridiculous and un
patriotic proposition to try to prescribe
whit people sball cat or smoke. It can
never be the rule of action in a City like
this.
E. W. Briggsâ All my researches in law
and history prejudice me against such
laws. A man of full age ought to bs his
own judge of what he smokes or drinks.
M. Bonim of the Richelieuâ That law
would rob an American citizen of his lib
erty. It cannot be possible that it will
even pass. What crank had the audacity
to introduce it unless hÂ« wanted to cinch
the dealers?
F. M. Fergusonâ lt Is ridiculous to dis
cuss it. The people out here love liberty
too well and the Jaw would be invalid if it
was passed.
' Mrs. Mar* ha i Asks Damage*.
Mrs. Julia Marshall and her husband, Irving
Marshall, have sued James Callanan for $5000
damages. Mrs. Marshall complains that the
defendant aid brutally beat, assault ana
wound her on the 31st of last Marcfi, causing
ncr to be "confined to Her bed for eight
weeks." she think.-, she require! the amount
rr.eiuioned to compensate her tor her suffer
ings.
Sold the Bicycle.
H. A. Ossok-, a plumber, was arrested yes
terday by Harry Reynolds aud booked at the
City Prison on the chnrgeof petty larceny. He
iicnarged with stealing a bicycle from the
cyclery of Harvey Fuller, 1232 Folsom street,
and selling it to A. B. Jacobs, 418 Larkin
street, who also keeps a cyclery.

Yesterday Was a Emy One for the
Soldiers at the PresidkâOu
post Duty To-SJoirow
Yesterday was a busy one at the Pre
sidio post, for tbere was a drill by the
light artillery on the main parade ground,
maneuvers by the cavalry on the north
ern extension of the parade ground, field
exercise by the infantry at the foot of the
hill and big-gun practice at the fortifica
tions at Fort Point.
The artillerymen made a fine showing
in the handling of the pieces and in firing,
while the cavalry, as usual, made a good
display. Ths big-gun practice was prac
tical, as was also the work of the infantry,
which was nearer the realistic than can be
attained on the parade ground.
It was a problem prepared by Captain
O'Connell, the senior captain of the First
Regiment, for the purpose of enabling the
lieutenants of companies to place their
men, as if in case of battle, to the best ad
vantage, and to save them from the fire of
the enemy. The plan is a good one and
the configuration of the country admir
ably adapted to testing the judgment of
the officers in the placing of troops,
whether on the offensive or defensive,
with a view to obtaining the best results.
It gives the officers the best opportunity
to carry out theories, and it gives the
men a chance to understand a little out
side of routine of the gooaeatep. The men
carry out the orders of the officers, and
the officers, if t:.<.-y make any mistakes,
have the same pointed out to them by
superiors, who are able to paÂ«s in judg
ment on the movements and who can ad
vise them.
There were four companies in the field,
one company forming the attacking party
that had for its mission the capture of a
wagon train defended b7 the other three
companies. Tue attacking company war
under command of Second Lieutenant
Dnnnis Â£. Nolan, while the battalion was
under the orders of First Lieutenant
Hiram McL. Foweil. The train and
escort was passing down a defile from the
main road north of Mountain Lake, near
the Marine Hospital, on its way to shel
tering woods east and north of Golf Hill.
Suddenly scouts repotted the enemy
lying in wait in the lupin and high mus
tard on the south side of a fence that runs
east and west. Two companies were sent
forward to attack the enemy, while tne
tnird remained with the train to protect
it from capture. It was then the officers
were called upon to use their judgment in
distributing their men according to tactics
and at the same time save them as much
as possible from the fire of the enemy.
The men were bent out as a skirmish line
and when at a reasonable distance were
deployed by the center, right and lelt
flank, and when in the judgment of the
officers they had advanced far enough one
section encaged the enemy to draw its
attention while the oihers made move
ments that would tend to be advantageous
and save the train from capture.
'1 hat ended the first attack and then a
second attack was made, but In this the
I men were not so well handled as in the
first, for tbey were too much exposed to
the lire of the enemy. Had it been a real
buttle the enemy irom undercover would
have picKea off the advancing defenders
without trouble. One of the lieutenants
ordered his men to kneel and prepare to
fire when at a distance of fifty or sixty
feet irom the fence, and for this the inspec
tor drew his attention to the lact that the
men ought to have been taken as close to
the fence as possib'e, â¢ â¢f or " sa jj tne j n _
specior, I# a fence is a great protection,
even if it is only a three-rail fence. The
point at which you ordered your men to
kr.eel and lie down exposed them to the
fire of the enemy an i had bullets been
flying there would havo been a great many
killed." One heuienant was also given a
res rimand for following too far behind his
command. As a whole the men were
commended for the promptness and cor
rectness in carrying out the commands
givpn them.
There was one thine lacking to make
the affair realistic arid thai was a few
rounds of blann cartridge.*. Had shots
been exchanged the inspector would have
had a better opportunity to judge of the
actions of the men.
To-morrow there will be outpost duty,
in which all branches of the service will
be engaged. This will be an interesting
Bight to those who have never witnessed
it. The outposts have for their object the
guarding of all approaches, the obtaining
of the earliest information of the enemy's
movements and to obstruct and delay his
advance. The outposts cover the entire
front of the main command and extend
well beyond the flanks and toward the
rear. Generally outposts are disposed as
follows: A line oi sentinels who keep
themselves concealed and watch the
ground in their front and between thorn
and the posts right and left, the sentinels
being from 100 to 300 yards apart; ihen
there is a line of small groups called
pekets posted about 400 yards in the rear
of the center of the line ot sentinels, for
which it furnishes reliefs; behind these is
a line of larger groups called supports
posted 600 yards in the rear of the line of
pickets, and behind this line is the reserve
about 1000 -yards in the rear of the
supports and 2030 yards in front of the
main body. These distances are not arbi
trary, but may be modified according to
circumstances by the commander of the
outposts. _____^___^___

NEW YORK, H. V.. May 24.â The stock mar
ket opened weak on light dealings, the declines in
some specialities being quite sharp.
The bulk of dealings after 10:15 was in special
ties In which some erratic variations were noted.
The general tendency of values was toward a
lower plane.
Curing the forenoon the stock market showed
decided irregularity as it was apparently known in
certain quarters that no decision would be handed
down to-day Id .the Nebraska maximum rate case
and It was calculated thai the postponement would
be hurtful to the market as much less attention
had been paid 10 the Interstate Commerce Com
mission case on the same general lines. The mar
ket was also unfavorably &ffecu d by further de
clines in the anthracite stocks and by the engage
ment for export of $1,250 000 in gold in addition
to the $500,000 announced last week. The
amount was in excess of recent estimates, but of
Â»he tola $1,250,000 was Obtained by a shipp n?
baniilru-hou.se from private sources and wl 1 thus
not y fleet the treasury gold balance. â 
Upon the announcement of the supreme Court*
decision in the inters. at - commerce Texas racilic
rate case a tinner tone developed, which was
most pronounced in the granger group, though
more or less shared in by the whole list, including
Anthracite stocks. The sharp recovery in the

YESTERDAY'S WBtAI MARKET.
Ihe following resume of the wheat market Is
furnished by E. A. Bresse, Produce Exchange
gralnbroker, 412 Pine street.
San Francisco, May 24, 1897.
Chicago.
' Wheat opened strong on higher cables from Liv
erpool. Added to this French markets were ad
vancing on bad crop conditions. July opened at
72@7^i/ c and advanced to 72% c, where offerings ,
were rather of a larger volume than buyers seemed
willing to carry oft and the price dropped sharply
under this influence to 7l %c. '"
losing Liverpool and French cables steadied i
the market at this point. For a short time there
was gcod buying, but offerings were liberal. As
tour as the huvlng eased the price again dropped
suddenly to 711/4<3, where buying against, puts held
the market until the close. The bears'aggressive
ness during the day was. most pronounced, while
the bulls acted with ; timidity. The latter tried to
harden the market around 72% c in . order to sell
out their holdings, but in this they were out-gen
j crated. Many holders were forced to sell out at a
loss, where a few moments before their trades
! showed a profit.
The remarkable advance in French floor mar
kets was equal to 6c per bushel In wheat This
news, while favorable to the bulls, met with very
little encouragement, trom the fac that France is
not buying wneai In this country. | should condi
tions change and a brisk demand for wheat spring
up the trade will change front quickly. A few en
gaged cargoes would bring about this reversal of
conditions. | ,' | H a |jll iiiflHrtllMM ' >WH) 'MUMBMIM. '
Kepo.-ts Â»rom the Northwest are very encourag
ing. It Is claimed. that the wheat acreage of the
> orthwrst is 20 per cent larger than lust year,
but it must be remembered last year's acreage
was smaller than usual, 011 account of a very late
season in North Dakota, owing to excessive rains
from the middle of â  April until the last of May.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, May 24. )
Rev. Marshal Law of the Church of the
Advent in his church pamphlet has incor
porated a statement that will no doubt
provoke many replies.
It refers to the recent diocesan conven
tion held in San Francisco last week. The \
opening of the convention always has for
one of the numbers on the programme
the celebration o the holy communion.
At St. Luke's last week, where the conven
tion met, there were over 100 ladies at the I
session and not one of them partook of
the communion.
Dr. Law states that this ii no doubt due j
to the fact that old-fashioned communion ,
cups were used, and that a desire not to
partake of wine that had washed the
mustaches of ministers no doubt deterred
them.
The minister's statement is as follows: \
It was rather singular that while there were |
over a hundred ladies present at the open- j
ing session of our late convention in St. Luke's
in Ban Francisco, not one of them went to the ;
Lord's table.
Did they see too many long mustaches â¢
among the clergy? There were only about j
thirty laymen who went to the hoiy com- j
munion. If people prefer the '-common cup,"
how is this to be accounted for? It was nearly
the game last year at Grace Church. Reform
In the manner of administering the holy com- j
munion must come, and why should the Epis- :
copal clergy "kick â¢gainst the pricks" in this j
rustier? They are absolutely alone as a body |
holding out against the inevitable.
â  Whatever men may do, women on this coast
do not longer willingly drink from the com
' mon communion cup.
; Dr. Law has the most remarkable dia- i
gram regarding this matter that could |
possibly Da drawn. It consists of the up- j
per lip of people who have mustaches of
various lengths, and by a dotted line on a
level with the Jip the pastor shows just
.how much hair in each individual case is j
â washed in the communion cup when such ]
people partake of the sacrament. Dr.
Law says that no lady after looking at his
diagram would ever dream of drinking
from a cup after a score of such men had
used it. He declares that the action of
the ladies last week is conclusive proof I
that a change is desired.

LAUNDRY TBOUBLE.
The Erection of a Building; Antagonize!)
an Entire Neighborhood.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 24.- A perplex
ing question has arisen under the new
laundry license ordinance. The Trustees
adopted certain regulations for the con
duct of laundries, and in compliance
therewith Oscar Meysel, a well-known
business man of this city, has leased a lot
Belonging to him on San Antonio avenue,
between Willow and Walnut streets, to
certain Chinese for a term of five years,
and has collected tbe first year's rent.
In compliance with the terms of the
lease he is now having a building erected
and is to have it completed by the Ist of
July, when the Chinese will take posses
sion. Eut the invasion of tbat part of the
city by a washhouse is not at all accept
able to the residents of the neighborhood,
and the other property-owners have en
tered a vigorous protest on the ground
that it will greatly depreciate the value of
tbeir property to have a laun Iry there, as
well as make it undesirable for residence
purposes, which is its present sole use.
A protest will be presented to the Board
of Trustees to-night, and it is proposed to
induce that body to pass an amendment
to the ordinance forbidding the erection
and maintenance of laundries, except
within certain limits. Tne property-own
ers retained City Attorney Taylor to en
deavor to effect a compromise with Mey
sel, but without success.
Mr. Meysel has teen in oommunloation
with ex-Mayor Chapman of Oakland, who
has had experience in similar cases. Mr.
Meysel has offered his property to the
objectors for much less than it cost him,
but they refused to buy it, and now he
says that the time has come when be
m;sst realize something for his investment,
which bas been for a long time idle. He
says he will hght ihe matter 10 the end,
and maintain his right to use his property
as he pleases.

HUDELSON ASKS
HEAVY DAMAGES
Beginning of His Alleged
Wife's Suit for Fees
and Alimony.
Attorney Frick's Objection to
an Amendment Sus
tained.
Depositions in Evidence Alleging That
Cora Webster Was Kncwn as
Mrs. Hude son.
â¢ 1 ": .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, )
903 Broadway, May 24. J
The suit of Cora Webster, otherwise
known as Millie Hudelson, against Rev.
B. F. HuJelson, former State president of
j the American Protective Association, for
j maintenance came up before Judge Ells-
I worth to-day. The defendant's attorney,
William Jordan, asked to be allowed to
amend the answer to the complaint so
that a counter claim for $50,000 damages
I for defamation of character could be in
j serted.
The amendment states that in August,
1889, B. F. Hudelson married Ida Wood
ford in Modesto and that he has been liv
ing happily with her ever since and that
three children have been born to them.
It also shows that the defendant has been
a regularly ordained Baptist minister for
many years. The proposed amendment
concludes: "The bringing of this action
by the plaintiff has caused the defendant
great mental anguish, and the c harden
have been heralded all throughout the
United States, ridiculing, maligning and
defaming him, wherefore he asks for re
lief in the sum of $50,000."
Attorney A. L. Frick at once objected to
I the amendment, and Attorney Jordan
then stated that this was not a complaint
for divorce, but a suit for maintenance.
An argument followed and Attorney
Frick said: "This complaint alleges
marriage and failure to provide
and the answer denies all the charges,
and now the defendant see to incorpor
ate an action for damages in the answer,
j which is contrary to precedent. If any
thing, the amendment would bs a cross
complaint and cannot be joined to the*
answer in a case of this kind. Suet! an
amendment has no proper place in the
| pleading of this suit, and what the motive
13 that prompts it I don't know."
Judge Ellsworth reviewed the case
briefly and stated .at such a claim as
made by Hudelson could not be incorpor
ated in his answer, as it was not a counter
claim. The court then denied the de
fendant's motion.
Attorney Jordan then asked for a speedy
trial. He said he did not believe that it
would take more than one day to try the
caS", and tbat not more than a few
minutes' oral testimony would be re
quired. Judge Frick wanted a delay until
he had consulted with his associate, Reel
Terry, but Jndge Ellsworth set the mat
ter down for hearing June 9.
The complaint states tbat Hudelson
married Cora Webster in 1885, and that
they have been ever since husband and
wi'e;also that Hudelson deserted her in
1886, and that l-.e has a monthly income
ot $250, of which the plaintiff thinks that
$125 a month is a reasonable allowance.
Judgment is also asked for $500 forcounsel
fees.
In answer Hudelson denies that he was
erer married to the plaintiff or that they
were ever man nnd wife, or tnat be ever
deserted her. He also asserts that in 18S4
and for four years afterward the plaintiff
was a notorious woman publicly keeping
a disreputable house in Modesto and else
where, and that this suit has been brought
solely for the purposo of levying black
mail upon him and traducing and be
smirching his character.
The answer also states that the woman
has been married several time* and mat
at the time of the alleged marriage to de
fendant the plaintiff was a married
woman.
Several depositions are filed with papers
from re 1 " 1 ?'" who assert that they have
known Hudelson for several years. Mrs.
Annie Medley deposes that on several oc
casions Hudelson Introduced the woman
to her as his wife, ai.d that he also stated
that they had been married by Rev. Mr.
Odum, a Baptist minister.
James Kinkead's deposition states that
Hudelson was known as a reckless charac
ter in Modesto some years ago, and that
he introduced Cora Webster as his wife.
Similar testimony is given, by Mrs. J.
Merry nnd T. W. Burton, and it all forms
part of the complaint.
UPHOLD THE MEN.
Co-edii at the State Vnirerslty Do Not
Support the Statement That the
Eds Are Unchiralrons.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 24.â A sym
posium of answers has been made by the
co-eds belonging to the class of '97 on the
question whether the girl students are
well treated by the menâ both faculty and
studentsâ at the State University. Sev
eral questions leading to the same point
were sent out to each lady member of the
rlasi with the understanding that no
names were to be published.
It has often been hinted that co-educa
tion at Berkeley has rubbed off the polish
of chivalry from the faculty members and
that it rapidly tones down the gallantry
nnd politeness of the students, so that the
courtpou" nn:l attentive freshman becomes
a less attentive sophomore, an indifferent
junior an<l arude senior.
The young women of '97 who have
made any responses to the queries put to
I them do not join in these charges against
the other sex, but rather uphold them as
gentlemen of refinement snd not unpleas
ant college associates.

FOUGHT OUT TO
COMPROMISE
Big Water Companies Will
Divide the Hydrant
Privilege.
Pringie's Amended Resolution
Carries After a Heated
Debate.
â __ __
Every Councilman Sprks to the Ques
tionâGeorge W. Baker Figures
Prominently.
OAKLAND, Cal, May 24. â The great
fight between the two rival water compa
nies was lought out on the floor of the
Council chamber to-night and the result
might be called a partial compromise.
The matter on which the battle hung
wa< the alternation of the tire hydrants.
At present all the hydrants west of Like
Merritt are supplied by tlie Dingee Com
pany, and al! those east of Lake Merritt
by the Contra Costa Company. This is
about two-thirds to the new company,
and the light was over taking away from
it half of all the hydrants west of Lake
Merrit. Every Councilman spose of the
motion and tne amendment and politics
and platform were bandied without
gloves. A great deal that was personal
was said and many of tho speeches were
of a very fiery order.
The resolution to change the hydrants
was amended by Pringle so that instead
of referring to all the western hydrants it
referred only to those between the watÂ»>r
front and Seventeenth street, Lake Mer
ritt and Market street.
After a heated debate, in winch Attor
ney G. W. Baker took a leading part, the
amended resolutions were passed.
Rowe and Henneberry, who wanted the
original resolution passed, voted no on
the amendment, and Pringle. Earl, Girard,
Upton, Brosnaban, Watkinson, Heitman,
Cuveilier and Fibush voted in favor of it.
For the resolution as amended the vote
was the same, except that Cuveilier
changed. The expected sensation about
. tho bribery affidavit was not heard from.
The City Trustee*.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 24.â The sum of
$500 was ordered this evening by the City

eral to the health fund.
The charges against Police Officer Kemp,

Chief Krauth of the Fire Department
was granted his annual vacation of fiftee n
days and District Engineer Millington
was appointed temporarily in his place.
Tbe board passed an ordinance to hold
the regular meetings on the first and third
Monday of each month, instead of weekly,
as heretofore.
An ordinance was introduced by City
Trustee Scbuete making it a misde
meanor to promote tbe sale of or influence
others to purchase any land by threaten
intt to construct or maintain on said
property any wasbbouse, stable or
chicken â¢ yard, or any other structure or
nuisance which would be offensive to resi
dents of that neighborhood.
An amendment to the laundry ordinance
was offered by Trustee Clark requiring
the permission of at least live property
owners in a residence block in which it is
proposed to locate a laundry.

BERKELEY, Cal., May 24.â As a result j
of the capturing by John Irwin, one of ;
the U. C. police, a few days ago, of lour
young girls in the act of stealing cherries i
from the trees of the university experi- j
meiit station, extraordinary vigilance is
being kept over the property within the
confines of the campus fence. Yesterday
three small boys were arrested by Captain
Etnil Kellner, foreman of the grounds, for
pilfering fruit. The girls were given
their freedom after having been given a
lecture on morality, but tne lads were
dealt with more severely and confined in
jail for a few hours.
The opening of the fruit season and the
great crowds of visitors from the cities
about tee bay who roam over the grounds
on Sunday have caused extraordinarily
strict orders to be issued by the foreman.
New signs have been placed in all parts of
the grounds prohibiting picnicking and
the throwing of paper and rubbish about.
Instruction has been given to his sub
ordinates by the captain to protect
with special care the athletes' running
tract. Last vacation the track and appar
atus were demolished by the small boy.

Nothing was thought of it, however, and
after reaching home he went out into the
stable to attend his horse. After a short
time search was made, as he did not re-
turn, and his lifeless pody was found on
the floor of the building, where he had
fallen and died instantly. The cause is
believed to have been heart disease, De-

DAVIS' WILL IN
HIS WIFE'S ASHES
John M. Curtis Describes
the Finding of a
$2,000,000 Paper.
It Had Been Soldered - in . a
Copper Box From the
Crematory. ,
Interesting Proceedings in an Im"
portant Probate Contest in Judge
Coff Court.
Judge Coffey's court was the scene of
the greatest judicial interest at the new
City Hall yesterday, for the Jacob Z.
Davis estate contest was called for trial,
and as the amount involved is about
$2,000,000, while the James G. Fair estate
contest calls for only $1,000,000, the crowd
naturally flocked to the place where the
biggest states were being played for.
Mrs. Belle Curtis and Miss Lizzie Mail
are the proponents of the will. They do
not claim any blood relationship to the
deceased, J. Z. Davis, but are the nieces
of Mrs. Davis, wife of said Davis, who
died a short time before he did. They
lived in the family of the testator for a
great many years, and there is no dispute
that they were very dear to him. On the
ether hand the blood relatives of Davis
declare that Mrs. Curtis and Miss Muir
joined with others in prejudicing the
mind of the deceased against his own
family.
Attorneys George A. Knight, Charles
Heggerty and George D. Collins are attor
neys for the contestants, while the pro
ponents of the will are represented by
Mastick & Mastick, Reddy, Campbell &
Met^on, Garret McEnerney and W. B.
I read we 11.
It is conceded that the true name of
Davis was formerly Jacob Zigler Dtdaker.
He changed it to Davis when he came to
this coast on account of some family dif
ferences, there having been nothing to his
discredit in his early history.
John M. Curtis was the first witness for
the contestants, Mrs. Catherine Stead and
Josenh P. Wilson, niece and nephew of
the deceased. Mr. Curtis is the husband
of Mrs. Belle Curtis, one of the legatees
under the will, and consequently is the
brother-in-law ot the other legatee, Miss
Muir.
Handing the will of Mr. Davis
to Mr. Curtis, the first question
offered by Mr. Heggeriy was in re
gard to when be first saw that docu
ment. He replied that it was in the
office of Boyd & Davis, in the Thurlow
block, on the 4ih of November, 1896. He
said that. Attorney George Mastick, M.
Ryan, Alexander Boyd and himself were
present.
The story told by Mr. Curtis was to the
effect that he went witn the late Jacob Z.
Davis to the store of W. W. Montague and
ordered a long square copper box with
rounded corners, which, he said, was to
contain the ashes of nis wife who had died
a short time before. Subsequently the
witness and Mr. Davis went to Montague's
btore, obtained the box and took it out to
the cemetery, where the ashes of Mrs.
Davis were placed in the box. The box
was soldered up by a plumber or tinsmith,
and Mr. Davis took it and started home
with it.
Mr. Curtis did not see the box again
until about the 4th of November. 1896.
The box was then found in a private safe
in Mr. Davis' residence at 408 Post street.
Trial safe had been locked for some time.
The wny in which it came to be opened
was brought about simply enough. Mr.
Curtis said that after the death of Mr.
Davis a search was made for a will. An
effort was made to open the private locker
of Mr. Davis in the safe of Boyd & Davis,
but the locksmith employed was not
able to do the work, so he went for more
tools, and during his absence Mr. Ryan
tried the lock and succeeded in opening
it. In the locker were found a number of
keys, a writing which turned out to be a
will bequeathing all his estate to his wife
and a few other documents of no conse
quence. Among the keys was a key to
the private safe in the family residence at
408 Post street. He took that key and in
company with Mr. Ryan opened the safe,
â where they found the copper box con
taining Mrs. Davis' ashes. The box was
taken to Mr. Curtis' office, a mechanic
was brought in by Mr. Ryan and the top
of the box was taken off by the use of a
soldering-iron. In the box were found the
â will here presented for probate, the ashes
of Mrs. Davis, the engraved silver plate
taken irom Mrs. Davis' coffin and some
tissue paper. The will was taken from the
box and the other articles replaced in the
box.
Mr. Heggerty wanted to know why the
â¢witness opened the copper Dox for Mr.
Davis' will. He replied that he suggested
iJie matter to Mr. Boyd, saying that they
had looked everywhere else for it, and
had not found it, so that was the last
mace he thought of in the matter. Mr.
Boyd said! "All right, John; I think you
ere right. It it is satisfactory to you, uo
BO.''
In answer to other questions, Mr. Curtis
said: "At the time Mr. Davis had the Dox
sealed up I saw a small paper in his hand.
It looked something like this document,
but Ido not know what it contained. I
did not read it. He said to me that be
guessed he might as well put the paper in
the box, and 1 said, 'Yes, it was right for
him to do just as he pleased,' so he put it
in the box. These things I recited to Mr.
Boyd, and that was really one of the
things that led us to make a search in the
box lor the will."
Mr. Heggerty asked the witness if he
destroyed any papers that he found in the
safe with the will bequeathing all the
property to the wife of the decedent.
Mr. Curtisâ don't think I did. If I did de
stroy any H was because they were of no im
portance.
The courtâ But did you destroy any such
papers ?
The witnessâ l don't remember.
Mr. Heggurtyâ lf you did destroy them, you
did?
The witnessâ Yes.

Mr. Heggertyâ Why did you continue to
loot for a will after you found the so-called
wife will ?
Witnes>â Mr. Boyd told me he wnÂ« sure that
there was another wil'. He remarked that a
Khort time before Mr. Davis left for me ERSt lie
said: "I am going Ehbi, and I have made my
will." To this, Mr. Boyd informed me, he re
plied: "I hope you won't forpret the girls.
Uncle Jacob," and he said no; that ho would
make provision lor them; tbat he had remem
dered thorn.
Another reason given by Mr. Curtis for
opening the copper box was tbat Mr.
Davis had Baic thai he wished to have his
ashes placed in the ?arae box with the
ashes of bis late wife. The witness added :
"I did not know anything about the fam
| ily history of Mr. Davis, and did not
I know that hiÂ« true name was Dediker. The
i day before he left for the East he toid me
that be hadn't a relative living."
It was developed that Mrs. Curtis and
Miss Muir have lived in the family of
Mr. Davis ever since they were children,
and tbat they were treated in an affec
tionate manner by him. It was also
shown that he had helped their brother
and other members of the Muir family.
Further bearing of the case will be had
to-day.

EMMA ASHLEY'S
NEW WEAPONS
She Will Ridicule E. J.
Baldwin in Living
Pictures.
A Strange Performance at the
Auditorium lor Saturday
Night.
One Group Will Show Miss Lilian
and the Millionaire in a Romeo
and Juliet Love Scene.
Miss Emma Ashley will appear at the
Auditorium on Saturday night at a bene
fit performance for her sister. Miss Lilian,
and her niece, Beatrice Anita.
Miss Emma will appear in the model
scene of "Ihe Clemenceau Case" and in a
series of living pictures. The rest of the
evening will be devoted to a presentation
of "Kitiy O'Connor."
According to Miss Ashley's description
of the living pictures in which sha is to
appear for the edification and amusement
of the audience, there will be an attempt
to tell the Baldwin-Ashley story in a j
series of pantomimic portrayals of recent
history â as interpreted by the Ashleys.
The arrangement of the groupings and
the story sought to be impressed on the
audience remind one of the original mys
tery and miracle plays with which the
English drama began.
In the first picture Miss Emma will be
dressed and made up to represent her un
fortunate sister in a sort of Romeo nnd
Juliet balcony scene. The Romeo of the
stage will be made up as a counterfeit pre
sentment of Lucky Baldwin.
"This will be a love-making act," said
Miss Emma last nit;ht, "to represent my
sister und Mr. Baldwin."
In the second living picture, according
to Miss Emma, she and the babe will be
clad in tattered and ragged garments,
wlnle the actor who personates Mr. Bald
win "will be waving us away ana refusing
us support."
The third picture will represent the ob
ject of the Ashley revenge in the hands '
of Mophisiopheles, while the fourth and I
concluding portrayal will show Misa
Emma and little Beatrice in Paradise â a :
-cene modeled alter the apotheosis of
Eva in "Undo Tom's Cabin."
The debutante had a number of photo
graphs of herself taken yesterday, posed
as the model in "The Clemenceau Case,"
just as sha will appear on the stage Satur
day night.
The sale of tickets has ereatlv encour
aged her, and she says there will be a
crowded house. , .',_'_â>'.
