CANEA, Crete, March 21. â According
to<he proclamation issued by ti.e foreign
admirals the blockade of Crete began at
8 o'clock this morning. It is apparent
that tho blockade i 3 directed solely against
the Christians In the interior, and that
the Moslems will suffer little incon
venience from the ac:ion of the six great
Christian nations of Europe. It appears
that the object of the blockading sqnad-
Ton is to prevent the landing of supplies
of food, clothing, etc., destme.l for the
starving Christian* in the interior, while
the Mussulmans who have Mocked to the
coast towns are allowed to land whatever
they want.
The.few Christians remaining here rind
it d.rficult to understand the motives that
are prompting the powers to exert their
strength to crnsh the Christian popula
tion of the island, while the Moslems are
given a free hand to do about as they
piease.
About the only hope for the Christians
omside the coast towns is in Greek block
aiie-runners, who will not hesitate to run
turoush the cordon of foreign warships
around- (be iiland.^^i.*^"*^'* 5 ?.?^:. 1 """'
There was an exchange of shots yester
day between insurgents and Moslems in
the vicinity of Suda Bay. The TurEish
warships in the bay bombarded the in
sirrgents. but the result is not known. A
number of foreign war.-hips were in -the
bay, but they took no part in the firing.
If any further evidence was necessary
to prove the antagonism of the powers, as
represented by their admirals, to the
Christians, it is furnished by an incident
that lias just occurred at Akrotiri, wnicb
is the place where ihe fleets recently
bombarded the insurgents' position. Akro
tiri is" on the peninsula of that name
which projec s in a northeasterly direc
tion from c'anea. The insurgents there
are cut off from receiving provisions from
the land sid.e by tbe Turkish and foreign
troops, and the foreign warships have
prevented them from receiving supplies
by sea. Their position is becoming des
perate, and they yesterday sent envoys to
Suda to bee that food be supplied to tnem
from the warships.
The Admirals refused to give them the
assistance asked for, but said that if raed -
cal aid was needed it would be forthcom
ing. Laier several of thedoctors from tue
fleet Visited the camp of the insurgents.
It' is reported here that wben the Italian
otticer who was intrusted with the duty of
notifying Colonei Vassos, the commander
of the Greek army of occupa'ion, of the
establishment of the blocka .c handed the
copy of the blockade proclamation to the
Greek commander, the latter, after read
ing it, declared tbat he would resist as far
as it was in bis power to do so. Later he
had a conference with the insurgent chiefs,
and he afterward stated he would cause
every copy of the autonomy proclamation
to re torn up.
The more the subject of autonomy is
considered the less practical it appears to
be, and the conviction is rapidly growing
tbat tUe powers will find their sciieme ot
no nse. 'I be belief prevails that under
the plan of autonomy it would be hopeless
for Moslems and Christians to obtain
equal justice.
Xhe religious feud batween the two sects
is too great to expect thai the Christians
would act justly toward the Moslems if
the former were in absolute control of the
Government. Autonomy would oniy
*erve' to aggravate the numerous bloody
feuds now existing, and fighting wouM
continue until the Moslems were extremi
nated. Thus far in the present troubles
two Moslems have been killed to every
Christian, which is a reversal of the condi
tions prevailing In former disturbances.
About two-tliinls of the island is owned
by Moslems, but most of it has been laid
v,astÂ«. All the landed estates are now in
the hands of the insurgents.
Judging from the reports which reach
Canea irom the camp of Colonel Vassos it
is-lhought that he intends to assume the
effensive shortly, in which cast* plenty of
employment will be furnished to the for
eign troops. It is rumored that Greece
has offered to buy the island form Turkey.
This idea grows in favor rapidly.
There is little doubt if Turkey would ac
cept such an offer, that the money for the
purchase could be f^ind in twenty-four
hours.

LONDON, Eng., March 21.â Chron
icle will to-morrow publish a dispatch
from Athens sayine that 1 tbe blockade of
Greece by the powers appears to be re
mote. It is understood t at Great Britain
has refused to join in such a blockade.
As the powers decline to accept Great
Britain's proposal to send a large British
force to restore order in Crete there is a
sort of deadiock, which does not promise
to be immediately broken. Greece is will
ing to accept any honorable practical pro
posal, but it is not like'y she will make
another herself and risk its refusal.
If the powers sugeest that Prince Gftorge
of Greece be 'made, Prince of Crete under
the suzerainty, of the Sultan Greece will
accept the suggestion. â ' >:i7 ; ; :
Official information in Athens repre
sents trie concert oi the powers as being
shaky, if not actually non-eiistant. The
moment, therefore, seems especially pro
pitious 'or the adoption of such a sugges
tion. One power has already pressed it !
repeatealy, although the Minister of that \
power in Athens declines to propose it to
Europe unless Great Britain makes a sim
ilar proposal concurrently. ',', f , ;
The Chronicle's correspondent declares
that a cordial exchange of views toward
a settlement recently passed between
King George and the Sultan through their
respective Ministers. He adds that the
Sultan asked M. Is'elidoff, the Russian \
Embassador at Constantinople, to ask the
Czar to act as intermediary. Count
Muravieff, the Russian Foreien Minister,
instantly stopped the negotiations, call
ing the suggestion perfidious. The Rus
sian pressure ' upon the Sultan to take
hostile measures followed. , .
The correspondent believes that British
torpedo-boats are watching the exit of the
Hellespont to train the real goal cf the
Russian transports that are nominally
en route to Crete.
The Times' Athens correspondent tele
eraphs that the blockade of Crete began
with a strong gale prevailing, which ren
ders the task of th' torpedo-boats and
other small vessels employed in blockade
duty very difficult. Three vessels laden
with provisions and ammunition have
started for Crete during the last few
days. â¢
The correspondent again asserts that it
is urgently necessary that the Turkish
troops be withdrawn from Crete at the
earliest possible moment. Nothing else
will induce the islanders to believe the
promises of the powers. The Christians
will forcibly prevent the departure of the
Greek troops so long as the Ottoman
troops remain. He predicts that if the
Turkish troops are withdrawn King
George will be willing to recall Colonel
Yassos and the troops under his com
mand.
ATHENB, Greece, March 21. â Tbe
Akropolis reports tbat there is great ex

Palestine and Syria are preparing to op

ber of Abyssinian pilerims have also been
affected by the war feeling against tbe
Turks and are joining the Christians.
TneGreeK warships Alpheosand Peneus,
which were recently recalled Irom Crete,

1 The insurgent chief Manouli declares
that the insurgents mistook the Ausirian
warsTTip Sebenico, . which recently fired
upon and sank a Greek schooner off the
island of Crete, for a Tunriish vessel, and
for that reason fired on her. He adds that
the schooner' had landed three cases of
ammunition before she was sunk.

SAUSALITO. Cax., March 21. â This
town was visited by a disastrous tire early
this morning which completely destroyed
the San Francisco Yacht Clubhouse on
Water street, the Oriel Hotel and three
residences. The loss is estimated at over
$25,000. The origin of the conflagration is
not known. The general impression is
that the blaze, like others which have oc
curred in Sausalito, was started by an
incendiary.
Tue fire started in the San Francisco
Yacht Clubhouse, which was built on piles
over the bay and having its main entrance
on Water street This building, together
withawbarV belonging to Capiain John
son, was totally destroyed.
The flames communicated to the Oriel
Hotel across Water street and then spread
to the north and south. Two cottages
owned by Mrs. Juliet Mills were burned to
the ground ; a dwelling owned by L.Goody
and occupied by H. V. Voeel and family
was entirely consumed, and a buildin
owned and occupied by Captain Louis
Johnson as a boathouse was torn down in
order to prevent the flames from com
municating to the cottages adjoining,
which were owned by T. J. Bass of San
Francisco.
The lire was discovered about 2 o'clock
this morning by Captain Joimron, who
saw flames issuing from the cupola of tbe
San Francisco Yacht Club building, and
gave the alarm. The United States Sur
vey boats McArtbur and Gedney, and the
cruiser Petrel sent men to fight tho flames,
and they rendered excellent service. They
brought buckets and formed a couple of
lines, and the water supplied by this
bucket brigade was all that was at hand
until the tug Alert arrived in Sausalito at
3:30 o'clock in response to a telephone
message. The houses on th#> hill jiist
above the fire were threatened, and had a
close call. They are occupied by J. T.
Harmes, M. Gorman, Dr. Case and E. B.
Carroll.
The Saosalito fire department was on
band, but the nearest hydrant was five
hundred feet distant, and their hose had a
length of but two hundred and fifty feet.
The loss on the Oriel Hotel is about
$8000, with $6000 insurance on the building
and furniture. John Ferguson was the
Joseph E Blanther, the Murderer of Mrs. Langfeld, Who Is Reported
to Have Committed Sueide in a Texas JaiL

in a Texas Jail.
Officers Were en the Way to Bring

to San Franc sco.
f NEW ORLEANS, La., March 21.â
Word was received liere late to-night
from Meridan, a small town in the north
ern pnrt of Texas, to the effect that Jo
seph E. Blanther, the Austrian nobleman,
who robbed and Killed Airs. Piilipa Lane
feld in San Francisco last May, commit
ted suicide in the jail at that nlace to-day.
i Blamber was arrested last Friday and was
| held awaiting orders from California. The
details of the act are meager.
BLAMTJUJSK'S CAREER.
Varied lAfe of the >ol>letnnn Culminate!
in Kobbery and Murder.
Blanther's career has been a remarkable
one. Born in 1859 at Jtadker&burg, in
Styria, Lower Austria, he grew up an
honored man and a soldier of distinction.
In turn, he served as an officer under
Archduke Ludwig Victor and in the
Thirty-second Austrian Infantry. He was
decorated for gallant services with the war
medal, Knight of the Italian Crown, order
third class, and the Order o! the Iron
Crown.
He deserted from the Eighty-fifth Hun
garian Infantry in 1885, and an attempt
was made to extradite him from Bangkok,
Siam, but he succeeded in making his
escape to the United States, and entered
the employ of Rand, McNally & Co. in
Chicago, tie was supposed at that time
to be a married man. In 1890, Blanther
associated himself with Richard. Nicolai,
and they entered the business of publish
ing maps. The firm failed in 1890.
Shortly after that he left Chicago and
went to Canada. Later he was heard
from in Arkansas, where he was married
again without the formality of a divorce
haying first been obtained from his wife
in Chicago.
.Blanther was then known as Arthur
Forbes Lavanix Vrecourt. He and his
bride went to New York, thence to Flor
ida and to Denver. Under the name of
A. D. Forbes he started in business in
Atlanta, Ga., and from there, in 1896, he
fled to this City, deserting his wife. He
resumed bis name of Blanther. As such
he became acquainted with Mrs. Philo
pena Langfeldt, the woman he subse
quently murdered. He became a regular
and welcome visitof to the old woman's
house at 1225 Geary street. He was dash
ing, handsome and a fluent conversation
alist. She liked him very much and
tried to please him. He believed her
rich, especially that she made a display
of diamonds whenever he called.
On the morning of May 15, 1896, the
dead body of Mrs. Langfeldt was found
cruelly mutiLtted and stripped of all jew
elry in the rooms where Blanther had
been her only visitor the night previous.
The murderer had calmly washed his
bloody hands and 'left the house by an up
stairs widow. He went to his own abode,
slept there that night, and the next morn
inc, after pawning the diamond rings he
had robbed his victim of, he disappeared.
The first heard of his whereabouts was a
few days ago, when he was discovered
under his old name of Forbes in Texas.

LOBBYISTS AND
THEIR BACKERS
MUST EXPLAIN
Bert Packard and Banker
Blodgett Are Among
the Missing,
MUCH MATERIAL FOR GRAND
JURY INVESTIGATION.
If Legislators Were Bribed to Vote for the
Coyote Claims Bill, It Can Be Re
vealed by the Authors of the
Telegrams Seized.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., March 21.â
Though the Legislature has adjourned
sine die, and Bert Packard has disap
peared, and Assembly man Power of San
Francisco has been exonerated in the eyes
of the Assembly from ail guilt in connec
tion with charges of bribery in reference
to the coyote-scalp claims bill, it is only
the beginning ol the ena that is in sight,
according to the opinion of the more
thoughtful.
As the matter was left by the Legisla
ture the fact was made clear that Bert
Packard had been using money in the in
terest of Assembly bill 410, better known
as the coyote-scalp bill. How he had
utilized this money, however, is not by
any means certain.
The older heads, familiar with legisla
tive methods, believe that shrewd lobbyist
ar Packard is acknowledged to be, he may
have fallen a victim to even more cunning
manipulators of men, and that his purse |
was lightened without a drop of the
golden rivulet having gone to flood the
fortune of any legislator.
However this may be the fact remains
that both Bert Packard and H. A. Blodgett I
of the Kern V&iley Bank, in view of the
startling disclosures made in the fourteen
telegrams read to the Assembly yesterday,
stand before the public with a heavy cloud
upon their reputations.
As one of the possibilities of the near
future their pait in the sensational finale
of the session of the Asembly may be the
subject ot investigation by a Grand Jury.
Should this transpire the guilty Assem
blymen, if there be any, may be brought
to light and to punishment.
At this writing the whereabouts of both
Packard and Biod^ett is unknown. The
former is reported to have gone to Carson,
Nev., and the latter is reported to have
vanished from his usual haunts.
So much for the suspected bribers. But
there is a store of trouble ahead appar
ently for ihose who were instrumental in
bringing them out of the shadow. Now
that the excitement of the chase, so to
say, is over, and calmer reflection has
taken its place, the course pursued by the
sub-committee, consisting of Assembly
men Burnett, Anderson and MelicK, in
seizing and forcing open the box of West
ern Union telegrams and making public
the contents of fourteen of them is re
ceiving as much attention as the facts
disclosed by those dispatches.
Few attempt to defend their causa from
a legal standpoint, and some go so far as
to say that the Western Union Telegraph
Company has cause of action not only
against the members of the sub-commit
tee, but against Constable C. W. Long of
Trnckee, who seized the box of telegrams
on the strength of a telegraphic subpena
issued by the committee, and against
every member of the Aosembly who voted
to have the contents of the entire fourteen
telegrams read.
Making public the contents of a tele
graphic or telephonic message by any
person, whether an employe of the trans
mitting company or by an outsider, is a
felony under the law, and is punishable
by imprisonment or fine or by both. It is
believed from the public expressions of
Superintendent Frank Jaynes of the i
Western Union Telegraph Company and j
of ex-Judge Carpenter, the counsel of the
company, that proceedings will ba taken
to bring *bout the prosecution and pun
ishment of every person who has been in
strumental in violating the contents of
tiie box of telegrams.
It is claimed that there is no authority
under the statutes- or in the constitution I
for the wholesale seizure of telegrams, as j
by decisions of the courts it has been
clearly laid down that telegrams must be
produced only on the proper order of a
court after such telegrams have been iden- J
titied by specifying the date, the names of
sender and recipient and the substance of
such messages.
Such & prosecution will not be under
taken, it is said, in any vindictive spirit,
but as a matter of self- protection to the
telegraph company.
It is asserted by some of the tele
graph people that the episode of the
seizure of these telegrams will materially
affect the business of all telegraph com

panies, and if the matter is not made an
issue more serious results will follow.
On the other hand it is claimed that the
attempt to send the telegrams out of the
State, and so beyond the jurisdiction of
the Legislature, was an ill-advised move.
Had they been allowed to remain among
t'..e records of the office, some say, no at
tempt would have been made to get at
them other thai: by regular process of
law.
To the many thousands who have
legitimate claims for coyote scalps against
the State, the all important question is:
"Will the Governor sign the bill?" It is
well known that the bill appropriating
$287,615 for the payment of these scalps
was drawn by and introduced at the
request of tbe Board of Examiners, of
which the Governor is a member, and that
he has favored its passage.
No one who has given the measure due
consideration believes it to be vicious in
any particular. While it appropriates an
amount of money sufficient to pay all out
standing coyote-scalp claims, 'it throws
safeguards around such payments that
will make it exceeJiugly difficult, if not
impossible, lor fraudulent claims to re
ceive recognition.
The bill as passed g yes the Board of
Examiners the power to pass on all
claims, and it is an open secret that there
is evidence in the hands of tbe board that
will greatly aid in segregating the im
ported and twice or thrice used scalp from
the home product and the legitimate
pelt.
With a knowledge of all the facts sur
rounding the origin of the bill and its pas*
sage opinion is about evenly divided as to
whether he will or will not sign the bill.
GEORGE WEEKS' VIEWS.
Says He Thinks Bert Packard Has
Been Jobbed by Some Older
Lobbyists.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 21.â George F.
Weeks, who was proprietor of the Bakers
field Californian, is perhaps better in
formed of the true inwardness of coyote
affairs than any other man in the State.
Mr. Weeks lived in Bakersfield several
years, and is now the proprietor of the
Aiamela Encinal.
"This coyote business is not at all under

A brflHant complexion is a beauty ta ft.
â¢elf. It pleases the eyes of thoughtless
people and the minds of thinking people.
They know that a really good complexion
b a sign of health, and created by Nature.
There are different ways of imitating a fine
complexion : cosmetics, which deceive no-
body but ruin the skin and make the user
look silly and prematurely old ; stimulants
which only give a temporary flush ; danger-
ous drugs which drive pimply disorders
from the face back into the blood. All
these "counterfeit" complexions are un-
â¢afe and easily detected. But the genuine,
onmistakeable, much - admired color and
clearness of health can only be obtained
j by clearing all bilious matters and humors
out of the blood.
The first step towards creating a good
complexion by Nature's own method is to
i get the blood clear, and the circulation free
and active. There is no complexion so sal-
low, muddy or pimply but it will be cleared
and brightened by Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery. It is the 'best natural
complexion-maker on earth. It sends the
fresh glow of real health to the cheeVs by
thoroughly clearing all bilious and eruptive
humors out of the blood. It strengthens
the digestion and -regulates the bowels in
â¢ mild, natural way. It gives brighter color
to the blood, and not only beautifies the
complexion but makes the eyes brighter
and the breath sweeter.
If the bowels be very much constipated,
it will be advisable to take small doses or

intimately acquainted with all the people
wuo are prominent in the receni develop
ments, and I am confident that, although
there seems to be evidence that money
â¢ was sought by B< n Packard, there is yet
another side of the question to be devel
oped.
"To understand this mattar thoroughly
it must be known that the coyote scandal,
as it has been known for years, was started
by the investigation of the famous Long
Grand Jury that sat at Bakerstield for a
whole year and started all kinds of rumors.
They returned some indictments, but they
all fell to the ground. While in session
they discovered, so it is alleged, all man
lier of frauds, and it all culminated in
smoke after one of the most thorough in
vestigations ever made.
"The indictments were against Bert
Packard, who was a deputy county clerk,
and two others against two men in In
diana, which were dismissed on motion of
the District Attorney. The one against
Packard was tried and tbe jury acquitted
him in two minutes.
"The stories told about Packard are
very unjast, as I know that on many occa

Tne indictment was based on an alleged

the man who brought the claim and the

Moore, who compiled the Grand Jury re

ready singed to the county was started
one day when the janitor's son brought
Bert Packard a couple of skins and asked
for a warrant, and Packard, to my posi
tive knowledge, chased him out of the
office.
"The first suggestion that all was not
quite Â»qucre came to me when Senator
Smith said so to Governor Budd alter he
vetoed the bill when it was passed by the
last Legislature. He lold the Governor
that the claims should be paid, as the
greater part of them were undoubtedly
valid claims aeainst the state, although a
few were undoubtedly crooked. When I
heard Smith say this I knew that there
must be sometuing wrong with some of
the claims.
"As far as Biodgett's bank is concerned,
I know personally that they were very
careful to get nothing but legitimate
claims. They rejected many that were
not eood, and I am quite sure that Blod
gett tried to be honest. Some of the
claims he rejected were put in later in ad
joining counties.
"Since the last Legislature the stupid
story has been smarted that there were
some people actually engaged in main
taining coyqfe farms. No one in the
coyote country did anything but laugh at
such yarns. I was in Sacramento when
the talk was started that money had been
used to pass the coyote bill. I
asked Assemblyman Melick about it.
and he said he did not be
lieve that there was any crookedness
in connection with the bill. Melick was
chairman of the investigating committee
and is a very tquare man. The dispatches,
of course, speak for themselves, but I am
of the opinion that Packard was jobbed
by some older lobbyists. I see it stated
that Packard is an old lobbyist. This ia
not so. As a matter of fact he is the
greenest lobbyist that ever went to Sacra
mento. Would an old hand have acted as
Packard is said to have done behind that
screen?
"Packard was led into this business, and
1 am certain that he would not willingly
job Blodgett. tfert has been fooled, and
I am confident that there is a chapter of
thi* business that has not yet been told.
"This whole coyote scalp business has
been made a basis for sensations that have
no foundation. This last business is cer
tainly peculiar, bnt I am certain that older
lobbyists than Packard are in the affair,
imd that when Mclick told me that he
thou ht everything was straight, he im
pressed the sentiment of nearly every
member of the Legislature.
"The claim < are lor the most part leeiti
mate, and as the bill provides for tne in
vestigation of each claim by the Board of
Examiners before payment I think the
Governor will not veto the bill."
"A fe w days ago I received a letter from
Mr. Blodtrett. in which he reierred to the
coyote business, and said I c bad been beset
wi ih all manner of communications. He
relerrea to some of his mining ventures,
and stated that he was out to make a tour
of inspection. As I have not heard irom
him since this last affair developed at Sac
ramento, I presume he is not yet back in
Bakerstield."
It said that Weeks has also seen a letter
showing that efforts have been made by
lobbyists to blackmail Banker Blodgett in
connection with the coyote scalp claim?.
WHERE IS BLODGETT?
The Bakersfle!d Banker Has Not
Yet Explained His Transac
tions With Packard.
BAKERBFIELD, Cal., March 2Lâ
There is considerably excitement uere
over the sensational developments in the
coyote sea. p scandal. There could not be
more coyote talk if the town had been
suddenly visited by all that 92,000
howlers
Banker Blodgett, on whom much atten
tion i-< centered, is out of town, and there
fore could not be seen to-<iay to throw any
light on the sensational affair. Of late he
has been devoting much attention to his
oii welis several miles in the country. At
his residence late this evening it was
stated that he was out looking after this
enterprise. Others who ore interested in
the scalp business were seen, and they
cl.iimed to possess no knowledge of the
affair save the press reports.
Charles Co .en who is interested to the
tune of $7000, declared that he knew noth
ing whatever of a "lobby" except what he
had read in the papers, but be added:
"If those telegrams De true some ex
ceedingly coarse work has been done. I,
for one, was opposed to any loboying. I
wanted the bill to go through on its mer
its. I think it would have, too, had it
been let alone."
A weii-known citizen just in from Sac
ramento says there were some hot tele
grams passed between Bakersfield and
Sacramento on Friday and Saturday. Of
course, he did not know their contents,
only he was sure ttiey were hot ones. It
is generally expressed by all good cit
izens that if the recent disclosures are
true the guilty parties should be punished
to the fu.lest extent, as this would rub off
some of the stain attached to Kern
County.
la an interview in a local paper before
tbe di*c os ires of Saturday Banker
BloJgett dauied in toto sending any tele
grams whatever So Packard. His lan
guage waa very positive.
One prominent business man, who is
interested $2000 worth in the scalps, de
clared that he nad rather lose all than to
have had such a scandal come out.

OTTUMWA, lowa, March 2Lâ A fire
which started at 5: 30 this biternoon in
Cullen's dry -goods store has destroyed
over $250,0C0 worth of property, and at 9
o'clock is still having its owu way. A
gale ii blowiug, aua there .-â¢ems to be but
little hope of saving any of \ the big brick
businebs block in which Cullen's store is
located. The fire started in the basement,
its origin being unknown, and it baffled
the department from. the start. The nre
men could find no fire, and were driven
back continually by dense clouds of
smoke, which hlied the entire block, up
strirs and down, and allowed the iiames
to eat their way up and out from tlie in
terior of the building, leaving the firemen
helpless to stop the destruction.
Cuhen's.dry-goojs store, $50,000, went
first; then came Prugh <fc Co., wholesale

while the dry-goods stock ot J. G. Meek,

will be ruined by smoke ii they escape the
flames, which seems improbable. Tue
block was worth $50,000, and office tenants
in the second story ion heavily. The in
surance is light. The Culitm Company
had just received its tpring stock. â â -
The fire was got under control at 10:30.
It was confined to the Richards block.

NO ABATEMENT
OF THE FLOODS
Situation in Many Places
Hourly Grcws More
Alarming.
Sensational Rumors of Casualties
Add to the Widespread
Consternation.
Dire Distress Exists in Arkansas
and an Urgent Appeal for
Help Is M .de.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., March 21.â Latest ad
vices from the flooded country of
here state that tie situation is hourly
growing worse. Out of thirty-eight tele
grams received here from the lower river
bat one records a jcessation of the rise.
This was from Cairo, 111., but the halt of
the flood there is due to the breaks in the
levees adjacent in Kentucky and Missouri.
The most disheartening intel.igence
comes from the lowa and Dakota valleys
of the Missouri River. Warm weather
has turned the snow to water, which is
added to the already overfluweil streams.
WorK on levee barriers is l-ractically aban
doned in Arkansas and Mississippi as use
less.
At Chicot, Ark., a bargeload .of sand
bags was dumped into a levee break.
They only served to widen the break.
This ia the experience at other points and
work on tbe outer barriers is abandoned
and every hand is turned to save the inner
levees.
A dispatch from Ripley, Term., says
there is a strong currant through Reel
Foot Lake and the old river bayou. It la
! feared the river will Â§eek its old channel
through the lake, which was shifted
twenty miles west by the earthquake of
1812. South of Helena, .Ark., the levee
breaks are most numerous and the dam
age greatest.
Tne five steamers employed by the
Memphis Relief Corps were re-enforcert to
day by two Government boats towing
I barges. T.ese steamers picked their way
through tree tops. The steamer C. B.
Bryan, from Memphis, ye-terday brought
in thirty people and A bargeload of live
siock. At Austin, Miss., lorty miles be-
I low Memphis, but two nouses remain on
| dry land. From these twenty-four people
were rescued.
A relief committee has been organized
in Little Rock, Ark.
Major Ambury. in cbaree of the river
and harbor work at St. Louis, has re
ceived a telegram from Secretary of War
A'ger directing that help and rescue
measures be at once undertaken by the
; United States fleet in this vicinity.
The Merchants' Exchange i. a< taken up
I the rescue work. A wholesale shoe mer
i chant received this appeal from a cu
| tomer at Osceola, Ark : ' Our entire coun
j try is in. great distress from overflow.
I We need help badly. Start subscription
I jit once."
Governor Jones of Arkansas sent a com
pany of militia to guuri the levee of
Desna County, as there were fears that
Missouri men might try to save their
own homes by cutting tne levee on tiie
j Arkansas side.
Unconfirmed reports of great loss of life
are met at every han.i. but lhe death-roll
cannot even be approximated until the
flood subsides. The situation is indeed
gloomy, with small prospects of imme
diate improvement.
DES MOINES, lowa, March 21.â The
Dcs Moines River, contrary to vii expec
tations, and in the lace ot the fact that
the weather has been cold for twenty-. our
hours, has riseu three feet since last
night and is now over sixteen leet above
normal, and still rising. The Fort Wayne
Eleciric Company's dam is holding tne
water so that m the upper part of the
city a large district is flooded that, but
for the dam, would be above high water,
and in the event of a further rise dyna
mite may be used to break the dam and
let the floods through. About 300 fami
lies have been driven out of their homes
by the water, but aside from this tue dam
age thus far is not heavy, as none of the
larger buildings have been moved by tbe
flood.
The Chicago and Great Western road
reports from Cedar Falls that the Cedar
River is so far out of its banks thai the
passenger depot there is flooded and a
rise of a few inrhes more will make the
cros>inc of the river by trains Impossible.
At present a box car is being used for a
depot. Southwest of neve on the same
road the Skunk River is higher than ever
ana trains are piloted over the weak places
in the g r ade with thp greatest care.
SIOUX CITY. lowa, March 21.â The
Floyd Kiver, which had a considerable
part of Sioux City under water last week,
is again within its banKs. The Big Sioux,
however, is still rising and causing untold
damage between Sioux City and Sioux
Falls. Other streams in this locality are
about stationary. Bridges are out every
where and little damage is left to be done
even should there be unotner rise.
The Missouri is rising, but stiil remains
within its banks. It is showing a tendency
to goree, but rising water has thus far
wa-bed the ice-jams' out soon after they
formed.
Sensational rumors are current bere to
nigbt of several big cut-offs on the Mis
souri river in which great damage was
done to farm property and live stock. As
the reported changes occurred at points
distant from any towps, it is difficult to
Verify the rumors. River men say the ac
counts are apparently exaggerated, how
ever.
The Little Sioux \9 reported as doing
great damage to-night near Correction
ville and Otto, this county. Residents of
the bottoms are moving to the hilis. On
the Big Sioux several carloads of cattle
were lost this evening.
BLOCKADE OF
CRETE IS BEGUN
Continued from Firti. True.
They were almost identical, and con
sisted of a merely formal announcement
of a blockade of Cretan ports against
ships under the Greek flag, commencing
at 9 o'clock this morning. Merobant ves
sels of neutral powers, including those of
the United States and of tbe treaty pow
ers while subject to overhauling by tbe
blockading warships of the concerting
fleets, are not to be disturbed in their or
dinary commercial occupations if tbev
carry no merchandise intended for the
use of the Greeks or insurgents on tbe
island. It is a question whether this Gov
ernment will give its consent to this form
of blockade, which involves a grave de
parture from international law and will
establish a precedent abolishing rights
that the United Stales does not desire to
surrender,
i There is little i! any likelihood of an
American vessel attempting to run the
Cretan blockade, for the stars and stripes
on merchant vessels in the Mediterranean
are practically unknown. An indication
of this is given in the records of the Suez
Canal, the American flag having pa-Bed
that highway only three times in 1895, on
two private yachts and one man-of-war,
while in 1896 :.ot a single vessel showed
our flat.' in the canal. This year the pas
sage of the cruiser Detroit, early next
month, will probably be the only occa
sion lor showing the American colors in
the Red Sed. Around Crete an American
ship is rarer t an at Suez. Nevertheless
if the United States should evenly tacitly
consent to being kept out of Crete where
there is no proclaimed condition of war
any more than there is in Cuba at the
present time, such action, it is anticipated
by those familiar with international pre
cedents, may establish an untoward pre
cedent in relation to countries where
American c mrnerce is immeasurably im
portant and where American merchant
flags are more numerous.

GEOHGE'S ZJXSr.EN A J LIBS.
Splendidly Aasittlnq Him at St. Pttera
buvj, London and ( opanhagen.
BERLIN, Germany, March 21.â The
understanding here is that Great Britain
has insisted upon the powers according
Greece two weeks' notice before the
loreign warships enforce a blockade
against the P. neus, the port of Athens,
and the port of Volo, in Thessaly, and it
is not at all in lavor of Russia's project
that the foreign troops in the island of
Crete shall attack the Greek army of
occupation under Colonel Vassos and
compel their withdrawal. It is known
litre that Lord Salisbury continues to
treat directly with the Greek Government,
but no official opinion regarding. Eng
land's action in this matter hat been pub
licly expressed.
The uuseen allies of King George at tbe
courts of St. Petersburg, London and
Copenhagen are splendidly assisting him.
Without incurring a cent of expenditure
for a secret service fund the Greek Govern
ment is kept apprised of every move
on the diplomatic board and has thus
been enabled to counter the efforts of its
foes at the three imperial courts.
To this is largely due the prolonging of
the negotiations which have from time to
time tnreatened to end in the most vig
orous coercive measures. Tbe Kaiser's
Government, bullied and annoyed, nas
definitely retired from tbe front, and now
limits its action to following tbe per
sistently active diplomacy of Russia. M.
Delyannis, the Greek Premier, has
abundantly shown, in the course of his
career, that he dues not lack in courage
or initiative, sometimes approaching
rashness. But he is now resorting, as be
fits the position, to Byzantine tactics.
The successive notes of his Government
to the powers have continued to lead them
into a series of diplomatic colloquies, the
tendency of which was toward com
promise and the aim of which has been
to give Greece, in the last resort, some
way of retreat from a most difficult situa
tion.
A most critical juncture of the past week
was when the Russian Government, alone
or in conjunction with Austria and sup
ported by the approval of the Kaiser,
threatened to cut snort ail parleying with
Athens and send the Russian and Aus
inan squadrons to the Piraeus. Instruc
tions were actually sent by Admiral Tyr
totf, Russian Minister of Mari.ne, to Ad
miral Andreieff, commanding the Russian
squadron in tbe Mediterranean, to take
his squadron '<> ' lit* I'iufus and await
orders from M. Onon, the Russian Minis
ter at Athens, who was to present an ulti
matum from tbe three imperial powers.
This precipitate action is understood to
have been averted more by the representa
tions of France than by any regard on the
part of the Czar's Government for the
maintenance of the "concert." It had the
effect, and perhaps it was so designed, of
forcing the hand of M. Hanotaux, French
Minister of Foreign Affairs, who wai re
luctant to offend French feeling by strik
ing at Greece, and at the same time disin
clined to hold aloof from France's ally.
While the Kaiser, like the Czar, has been
all for action lirst and parleying after
ward, Lord Salisbury's tentative policy
has been directly tbe reverse.
Probably the Kttiser would not have
hesiiated at a direct rupture of the con
cert. The hesitation came from St.
Petersburg; whether due to secret court
influences or to the delay of decision on
the part of France, or to both combined,
is a matter of surmise.
Greece has obtained a pause which, by
all accounts, was badly required. Out of
most contradictory reports as to the state
of the Greek treasury and the Greek army
which have been received here it is diffi
cult to ascertain the exact truth. Put
ting aside the obviously unreliable and
fictitious reports from GrÂ«*ek sources
which credit the Government with having
organized a perfectly equipped force of
03,000 troops, most of which are now on
the frontier, the statements from quarters
friendly to Greece credit her War Office
with managing to send to the front an
effective force of about 25.000 men, in
cluding the best of tbe reserves. There
are besides about 30,000 men under drill,
but a small portion of which force could
be relied upon for service in the field,
though they could take part in irregular
warfare.
The enthusiasm of the reserves appears
to have been cooled down, and many of
them have returned to their homes. At
all events they are no longer with the
colors. What happened in 1886, when the
Greek army was mobilized, has occurred
atain. At that time there was a fair rush
of men on tbe first call. The enthusiasm
spent itself rap dly. Out of 60,000 men
that the War Office counted on, not half
came under drill, and desertions became
numerous. Gendarmes and troopa had to
hunt up the" reluctant in every district,
and at one time nearly 25,000 men were
on the police rolls as being wanted for
evading service. The men called to the
ranks may not want in patriotism and
courage, but wretched payment, miser
able food and tbe needs of their work at
borne have put a strain on their patriot
ism. As to the treasury, it was announced
as ieady for war with Â£750,000 tn the chest
and no credit on Europe. Tne troops on
the (rontier are mostly barefooted and
hardly clad.
Tne advices of the Vienna Correspond
ence Pulitique, generally unbiased and
fairly accurate, describe tbe condition of
tbe Turkish troops on the frontier as bad,
but assert that the equipment of the
troops is excellent. These considerations
must wei^h with tbe Greek Government
in rendering it adverse to risking war.
These dispatches last week announced a
Servia-Bulgarian alliance, but since then
ii has transpired that the Athens Cabinet
had merely hoped for effective and imme
diate aid against Turkey trow these
Balkan States. It is now known that they
are rather against Greece than with her.
Tbe personal equation has come in again
and to the disadvantage of Greece.
In the spring of last year King Alexan
der of Servia visited Athens in connection
with his proposed marriage to the only
daughter of King George. The then

STEERERS AT LOGGERHEADS.
Unable to Reach an Understanding as to
the Filling of Senate Committee
Vacancies.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 21.â The
Republican and Democratic steering coin
mitto esof the Senate are having a hard
time of reaching common ground in fill
ing the vacancies on the committees. Mr.
Gordon, acting for the Democrats in all
the conferences he has had with Chairman
Allison of tbe Republican committee, has
taken the position that the Democrats
should be allowed to name a Democrat for
every Democrat who has retired, regard
less of tbe proportion such appointees
-would bear toward tbe whole committee.
Tbe Republicans contend that in some
cases at least this would work an injus
tice, and have refused to yield.
The one noteworthy exception is found
in tbe committee on appropriations. As
constructed by the Republicans, when
they reorganize! this committee it con
sisted of seven Republicans and six Dem
ocrats, but two of the men placed thereon
as Repub.'cans â Senator Teller of Colo
rado and Pettigrew of South Dakota â
bolted the St. Louis convention and no
longer count themselves as Republicans.
Of the six Democratic members Senators I
Blackburn of Kentucky, Br.ce of Ohio and
Cail of Floridu have tx-en retired. Call
will probable be returned when tbe Legis
lature of his State meets next mouth.
The Democrats insist npon naming a Dem
ocrat for every one who has been retired.
If this were done the six Democrats and
two bolting Republicans would form a
majority of three, leaving the Republicans
a total of bat five votes on one of the most
important committees, while at tne same
time the parly is charged with the re
sponsibility of the conduct of the affairs
of the committee. To fliis tbe Repub
licans will not agree, and until some con
clusion is reached thai will give the
"straight oui" Republicans the majority
vote on this committee there will be no
tilling of vacancies unless the Democrats,
Populists and bolting Republicans can
agree upon a consolidation ticket This
seems improbable.
Meanwhile the new Republican Senators
have been consulted, and having ueen
j mad* aware of the condition of affairs, I
are perfectly willing to go without com
mittee assignments until thoii steering
committee is able to force from the Demo
crats what they believe to be a just ar
rangement.
On no other committee doe* such a condi
tion exist. . The commerce committee
loses but one member, a Repub ican, in
the per-on of Senaioi dquire of Washing
ton ; finance loses a Repub ican in Senator
Sherman and aDemocrat in Senator Voor
heeÂ». The failure to till the vacancies will
have no effect so far as the tariff uill is
concerned, for it is known that Senator
Jones, Silver Republican of NÂ«vad>;, will
work in harmony with his Republican
colleagues on this question and will vote
to report the bill upon which they agree.
The Committee on linniigraiinn loses
1 Republican, 1 Populist and 3 Demo
crat-. The Judiciary also loses 1 Repub
lican and 3 Democrat?. The Naval
Affairs has lost 1 bolting Republican, 1
Silver Republican and 2 Democrats, fost
olÃces and Postroads loses 1 Republican
and 4 Democrats, thus sweeping out the
entire Democratic representation and
leaving Senator Butler (Populist) as the
only minority member. Privileges and
Elections loses its Republican ch-airman,
in the person of Mitchell of Oregon, and
2 Democtata. Public Buildings and
Grounds loses 1 Republican and 2 Demo
crats, and Territories 1 Republican and 2
Democrats. In each of these commit.ees
the Republicans have the best of it as far
as the vacancies are concerned, and they ,
can very well afford to let all the commit
tees drift along as they are until the
Democrats are wiliiug to come to their
terms.
BUS/NESS BEFORE CONGFiESS.
Senators Will Discuss the Arbitration
Treat/ This Week â Tariff Debate

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 21.â
There will probably be a marked contrast
between the proceedings of the two houses
of Congress during the next week. The
"deliberative" Seuat- will probably pass
most of its time behind closed doors, dis
cussing the arbitration treaty, while the
Hous will enter upon a four days' go-as

Thrilling Experience of the
T. F. Oakes, Given Up
as Lost.
Scurvy-Stricken Survivors of tbe
Crew P:cked Up Alter
Many Perils.
Hefoism of the Cap:an's Wife and of
the Rescuing British Saa
mea
'. .QUARANTINE, N. V., March '21.â
lohg overdue ship, T. F. Oakes, which
left Hongkong July 4. days ago, with
a general cargo for this port and which
was given up as lost, was towed into port
this morning by the British tank steamer
â¢ Kasbek, Captnin Muller, who picked her
.up last Thursday in latitude 35.10, longi
tude GJ 44.
The Ka'bek was bound from Philadel
phia for Fiume, Austria, with a cargo of
oil and lett the former port on Saturday,
March 13. On the following evening at 11
â¢ o'clpck blue lights were seen, ana Cap
tain Muller ordared the steamer's course
altered and bore up for the distress sig
* nals. At 1 o'clock she was close alongside
the ship* and stood by until daylight,
when signals were observed flying from
the ship asking that a boat be sent along
side as the ship's crew wera so disabled as
to be unable to man their own boats.
Chief Officer C. P. Holzman and threa
seamen at once put off in the Kasbek' s
yawl and when within speaking distance
heard a tale of suffering and sickness from
those on board the ship such as made
" them shudder.
Captain Reed of the Oakes reported that
his crew weie all laid up with scurvy ana
that tue provisions were well-nigh ex
hausted. He was unable to navigate the
ship with the hands at his command and
begged that he be at once supplied with
fresh food and vegetables and taken in
tow "for the nearest port, The boat re
turned to the Kasbek with the message
and Captain Muller at once dec ded to take
the vessal in tow. The weather, which
had been- threatening, now became bois
terous, and a northerly gale sprang .up.
Nevertheless, preparations were made to
' pass a hawser to the Oakes. At the same
time a boat-load of provisions was sent. A
manila hawser was paid out of the Kas
bek's stern to tbe yawl, but a tremendous
wave washed it into the propeller, which
was turning slowly at the time, but before
the engines could be stopped the screw
was so entanglea that it stopped suddenly
ami all the power of the engines was not
sufficient to move it.
An effort was at once made to free the
bctbw, but as it was* so deeply submerged
anrt the sea running so high it was found
to be impossible. For eight hours the en
gineer's staff labored to release the pro
peller, and finally disconnected the shaft
and found that by placing a Â«mall block
of ood between the couplings the screw
cb;iT<r Be mad? turn. By that time the
Oakes had drifted out of sight, and Cap-,
tain Muller, despairing of being able to
tow her with, herdisabled screw, deter
mined to find her and supply, her with
* provisions. Ail nisht bs searched the
horizon for traces of her, and at 6 P. M.
TuesJuy morning sbe .was azain lighted.
' The sea was boisterous at the time, but
Chief Officer Hotxman again volunteered
to attempt 10 board her, and as the en
gineer's reported the propeller to be work
*ing well it was decided to send a hawser
aboard. Accordingly a line was ura^ced
near the boat, and, after a good deal of j
hard worK, two hawsers were made fast, i
Mr. Holztuan and his brave crew cf three
doing the work, only the second and third
mates being able to help tbein.
The provisions were a godsend to the
scurvy-stricken survivors, and they began
to gather hope that they might again see
land. From last Thursday ; morning,
when the hawser was " passed aboard,
until the Sandy riook bar was reached at
7 o'clock last evening, no incident of im
portance occurred. The Oakes. was I
anchored on the bar, and again taken in !
tow ihis aiorning.
* Captain Reed of the Oakes when in
terviewed Quarantine on his arrival
this morniuc, told a story of -ufferin. and
privation. The Oakes ieft Shanghai on
the 17c:i of last May, and after complet
ing her cargo at Hongkong sailed 'from
; that port on July 4. The crew were ap
parently in the best of heal h with the ex
ception of Captain Reed, who., had been
ailing for some time, but who. under the
careful nursing of his* wife, thought him
self on the high road to recovery.
When six days out in thb China Sea, a
. terrific typhoon was encountered, lasting
several days, during w^hich the fore arid
main topmasts were sprune. The vessel
was obliged to run before the gale, which
had no sooner blown itself out than it was
followed by a second typhoon which blew
with great fury for twenty-four aays. The
vessel was now well out in the North
Pacific, arid' so far'off her course that
Captain Koed decided to shape his course
J via Cape Horn rather thar. by the Cape of
Good Hope, hoping thereby to make better
time. The weather remained line, nothing
but lipht airs and calms being experienced
until Cape Horn was rounded, 167 days
out.
Inthe meantime, the Chinese cook had
been taken down with a severe cold and
died on November 11. Afterward a sea
niw named Thomas King was taken down
with ".hat appeared to be scurvy, and
died December 26.
-"In quick succession ; Seamen Thomas
Olsen was taken ill and died January 12.
â¢ Thomas Jndee, anotherseaman,' was now
taken ill with cancer of the stomach, and
later Mate Stephen -G.' Bunker showed
symptoms of scurvy. The latter died Feb
ruary 4, a::d was quickly followed by
- George King, nn old man, who died on'the
Bth. On the 17th Judge succumbed, mak
, inp in all six deaths. " V_Â»
t .one by one the other sailors were obliged
to quit work, until on. March 1 nobody
wes left except the second and third
mates.
The captain and his wife were; ex
hausted.: nnd when a strong northerly gale
sprung up on that 'day, the brave woman
was obliged* to take the wheel for -eight
hours without relief, and without as much
as a drink of water she kept the ship on
her course. I The provisions were running
short, . although a supply had been ob
tained on January 17 â¢ irom the American
ship Governor from New York for
Melbourne, when ; off the Island; of Trini

MONTREAL, Qcebec, March 21.â The
Patrie, the leading French-Canadian pa
per of Canada, which is owned by J. J.
Tarte, Minister of Public Works for the
Dominion, and a leading member of the
Laurier Cabinet, publishes a very strong
article on the new American tariff, in
which il declares that the tariff con3ti-.
tutes a Chinese wall against Canada, and
if the Americans close their doors in this
way Canadians will have to take, their
own part. Instead ol driving Canadians
to seek political union, as some hope, it
will create resistance, and make Cana
dians fee! that while small in numbers
they are able to take care of themselves.
The hope is also expressed that the
Government will act with tirmness in
Canada's interests. It is believed the ar
ticle foreshadows a retaliation policy on
the part of Canada toward the States.- 1 ." i

BERLIN, Germany, March 21. â To
day's ceremonies in connection with the
celebration of the centenary oi Emperor
William 1, which properly begins to
morrow, consi?tea of religious services in
the William I Memorial Church at which
the Emperor was present. The Emperor
was receive*! at the Potsdam railway sta
tion by color de;achmenta from the vari
ous regiments, which he reviewed. After
the review the Kaiser placed himself ut
the luai of the column, which inarche-1
through Koniggraiz S.rasse, Branden
burg Gate and Unter den Linden ;o the
old Kaiser "Wilhelm Palace, where the
coior3 were deposited. A banquet was
given at the Schloss to the royal guests.
In the evening there was a performance
of grand opera at the Royal Theater and
gala performances at the Kroil and other
theaters. Ail of the official and many pri
vate buildings were decorated with flags,
bunting, etc., and presented a beautiful
appearance.
To-morrow there will be various parades,
the Emperor heading the troops to the
Kaiser Wilbeini 1 Gate, and the ceremony
of unveiling the monument will be pro
ceded with. When the unveiling takes
place a salute of 101 guns will be fired and
all the bells in the city will be rung. In
the evening a grand state banquet will be
given in the white hall on the Schloss, a
I erformancu of grand opera in the Royal
Opera-house and gala performances at the
other theaters. There will also be an
illumination of the public buildings
throughout the city.
A semi-official denial was recently given
to the report that ex-Minister of War
General Bronsart yon Scheliendorl would
stand lor the Reichstag in the Mecklen
burg-Gustrow District in the agrarian
interest in the coming elections. The de
nial was made in such a form as to con
lirm the beliei that he intends to become
a candidate for some constituency.
General Bronsart yon Schellendorf
would be a very uncomfortable critic in the
ReichÃtag for his iate colleagues, Minister
Boeif.cuer und Marschali yon Bibberstein.
He is just ihe man to pour out his pent
up wrath upon them, ana all moans are
being used to influence the Kaiser to pre
vent him from appearing as a member of
the Reichstag. General Bronsart is rather
out of favor with t v Kai.ser. Count
Waldersee, on ihe other Land, has been
restored lo li:s imperial Majesty's good
giaces. It is even said that the Couni was
consulted by the Kaiser in drawing up his
great navy schemes.
Does the Prussian police control the po
lice of the whole of the German States?
This is a question now agitating the papers
ot the southern States. A debate in tbe
Prussian Landtag as far back as January
U8 opened tne con tiovery. A member of
the Unterhaus, Herr voa Ddlwnz, called
attention to tbe lact that the Prefect oi
Frankfort was drawing an augmentation
of salary for exceptional services from
headquarters at Berlin.
Dr. M:qiel, Prussian Minister of Fi
nance, in replying, explained that the Pre
fect of Frank. orl exercised surveillance
under direction oi the Ministry ot Politi
cal Police throughout nearly all southern
Germany. Frankfort as a central point,
was weli titled for such surveillance. 'Ihe
particuiarists in ihe southern States are
wroth over the idea and are putting in
terpellations in their local Diets to ascer
tain how far the Prussian pulica control
extends. Unity ol action ot the political
police is a leading principle at Berlin.
Ihe Government has a^ain given notice
and German-Americans are especially ad
vised that Germans who have emigrated
without military duty will not be allowed
to reside in Germany excepi under very
particular circumstances, a record of
wuich must be kept in the War OHice.
The Hambu.-tr-American Steamship
Company will celebrate the fiftieth year
of the existence of that organization on
May 27 at Hamburg, and ihe Emperor is
expec.ed to be present at the jabi.ee fete.
The third reading of the bin providing
ior the Government's naval estimate* will
take place in the Reichstag on Wednes
day, but it is no; expected that in the final
vo.e there will be uuy change in the deci
sion of the Chamber .roxn that which was
recorded yesterday, when the report of
the budget committee rejecting the de
mands for credits tor the construction of
the new cruisers and a number of new
torpedo-boats was sustained. In the
meantime it is the general opinion that
the Emperor will permit matters to take
their natural course and refrain from pre
cipitate action.
Ii is announced that the whilom Prin
cess 'Jlnruay, lonneriy Claia Ward oi De
troit, who eloued ironi Pans some time
ago with a Hungarian iiddier called Janos
Rigo, ami who was afterward divorced
by her husband, Ihe Prince of Chi may of
Belgium, will appear ou the stage at the
Win tor Gaitun in this city accompanied by
her paramour.
Emperor William has issued a general
order ihut the army thall hencelorth don

tiii Majesty has also ordered thnt medals

be made of cannon cautureu by German
troops. These medals will be bestowed in
the first instance to members ot the army
in commemoration uf the centenary of
the first Emperor William, which occurs
to-morrow.
JELKCTIOAS IS AUSTRIA.
Christian Socialist- tut a Hide Swath
in /Vidft.
VIENNA, Austria, March 21.â The
elections for members of the Reicbsrath,
which began on March 9, under the new
Jaw which provides for almost universal
suffrage, are now almost finished. A
feature of the elections is that one-third
of the German Liberals who sat in the
last Keichsrath have been displaced,
mainly by German Nationalists. The
lower House will probably bÂ« composed
of 74 German Liberals, 42 German Na
tionalists, 28 Christian boculists, (>3
Clerical, 20 bocialiÂ«Â»ls and their allies, t>2
YoBBK CssrtSWi 21 Feudal Czechs, 59 Con
servative Poles. 15 Itaiinn Liberals and 54
representatives of other parties.
In t tie Ileichsrath elections, neid a few
days since in Vienna, the Christian So
cialists, a party designation which is mis
leading, surprised everybody by tbeir
strength. Their principal opponents were
the Social Democrats or plain Socialists,
who louud ihiii'.hey bad overrated their
strength, they polting 88,000 rotes to
117,090 cast by the so-called Christian So
cialists, which party now includes the
Anti-Semites.
Christian socialism was originally
founded by Archbishop Kneller of May
ence, who was a contemporary of La Sal.'c.
The socialist movement was causing
alarm at the Vatican when Archbishop
Kneller conceived the idea of turning it
to the advantage of the churci:. He ac
cordingly formed the German Christian
Socialists' party.
There is not much in common between
the latter and ihe Christian social organi
zation in Vienna, which is a confederation
of anti-Semites, Ultra Montanes and mal
contents of every species and variety, act
ing under the leadership of tne popular
agitator, Dr. Lueger. They have pros
pered and developed, thanks to different
causes. The discontent of tne lower
clergy was one of them, the fever of re
action amon; the upper classes in Austria
was another, but, tneir principal stimulus
has come trom the Vatican through the
Papal nunciator in Vienna. The higher
cii-rgy are themselves an enlightened body
of men, and have no taste for the disfavor
of t!ie Vatican in the domestic policies of
the empire.

declare were false representations being
made to them. < I riilii li went East about a
month ago. announcing that he was going
to work ud a colonization scheme, and it
appears ihat in Chicago he engaged the
as-istance oi one C. Stautz. He returned
in a couple of weeks. Mr. Greene, one of
the victims of the so-called swindle, makes
the following statement under oath:
"About Feb. 25, 1897, I read an advertise
ment in the Chicago Record which staled that
about twenty-live lamuies were wanted to 'po
to Chiifornia to wort in box factories,
wineries aud lumbar camps. Applicants must
be prepared to furnish their own expenses.
Apply to 84 Adams street. Dexter building,
Conrad Btautz.' On or ai out that date I went
to the place indicated and staved that 1 had
replied to the advertisement, and met S. N.
Griffith, who said that he was the person wlio
hail insened the advertisement. He stated
that 1 v, ouiil get steady work and that be
wou'il put meat work right away. As a con
tliti( a to getting employment he said I would
have to purchase a lot m Clovis, Cal., lor $150,
and w'.v $10 down aud $10 a month after that
until it was paid for.
On the first of March, 1897 I left Chicago
and cam*) to Fresno, and wnen 1 got here!
saw Mr. Griffith, who told me there had been
a large fall of snow and that I would have to
wait awhile. 1 have been here since March
5 und have secured -no work yet, although 1
tiave requested Mr. Griffith to get me some
thing to do several times.
When I KÂ°t here I found that the lots Grif
fith had for bale were in Shephard and
'league's addition to Clovis, and were worth
only nb jut $10 <>r $15. When 1 first arrived 1
signed an agreement to buy one of tno lots lor
$150 on the installment plan.
Greene' f companions are in the same
thght. The alleged swindle will be
looked into by the Hundred Thousand
CIUD.

STOCKTON, Cal., March 21.â The man

to bring the first coal into the bunkers in
Stockton today, and, to show the won
derful development of the mine 3, they in
viied a number of the leading; capitalists
of San Francisco to visit the collieries.
The following San Franciscans came up

The tirst carload of coal, which was or
dered by the Holt Manufacturing Com
pany of this city, was to have been brought
i:i with the return of the excursionists,
but so delighted wvre they with the won
ders they saw in the miles of tunnels and
drifts that they kept the employes busy
showing them the bights until it was too
late to load the cars. Hundreds of tons of
coal are now ready to be shipped Jo Stock
ton and will be delivered nere next week.
It is intimated to-day by some of those
close to the managers of the road that it
had been definitely settled that the big
hilh back oi the mines would be tunneled
sc-jn and the roed extended on to Oakland.
The gentleman who gave out this infor
mation is close in the council of the man
agers of the mines and ot the coal road,
and he staled very positively that another
railroad company had been negotiating
with them for some time to have the road
extended to the bay. Ttiis will involve
an enormous expenditure, but the pro
jsctors fimire that they will tap a portion
of Alameda County not traversed by the
â Southern Pacific Company, and that they
will have a good freigutins; business, aside
from the coal, that vvi.l be shipped from
Corrai Hollow.
There was not one among the business
men from San Francisco but who went
away more than pleased with what he saw
in the mines. In fact the visitors were so
astonished at me vast quantities of good
coal that they saw in s:crnt that they went
nway loud in their praises of the mines.
Nearly all returned by this afternoon's
train to San Franci-co.

THE ADAMS AT SAN DIEGO.
Naval Apprentices Reach Fort After Their
First Cruise on an American
Gunboat
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 21. â The
United States gunboat Adams, tbe train
ing-ship for naval apprentices, arrived in
port at 8:30 o'clock this momint:, after a
cruise of thirty-five days from San Fran
cisco. Lieutenant Milner reported all well
on board, including the 100 apprentice
boys, who are now in port aiter their first
cruise on the ''rolling deep."
"For the first ten days after leaving San
Franiisco," said Lieutenant Milner, "we
en countered very rough weather and the
boys were frightfully sick. Some of the
poor fellows were so ill that they declared
that they didn't want to live any long r.
But a few days of that sort of thing in
itiated them beautifully, and before we
bad been out two week* there wasn't a
sick man or boy aboard ship. The weather
since then has been fine and, as far as I
can judge, I believe the experiment of
training young American boys for the
United States navy will prove a^signal
success.
"We will remain here about ten days
and will then sail for Jlagdalena Bay,
thence to Honolulu, thence to Port An
geles, Wa>h., arriving back at San Fran
cisco about July 15. During our cruise we
have been under sail all the time, having
used none of Ui:cle Sam's money for coal,
and the boys have thus had an experience
in sailing a ship impossible for them to
acquire in any other way. During the
cruise we have sailed 3.'50 miles, going as
far south as Cape San Lucas."
VETOED BY WASHINGTON'S CHIEF.
Bill Providing lor a New Statehouse
Meets the Opposition of the
Governor.
TACOMA, Wash., March 21.â Governor
Rogers last night vetoed the capitol bill
passed by the late Legislature, and there
by destroyed n!l hopes of this State hav
ing a suitable statehoase before this cen
tury ends. Four years ngo plans were
accepted for a $1,000,000 capitol and the
necessary appropriation was made, pay
ment, to be made by warrants drawn on
the capitol fund, having for its basis the
big land grant given to the State by Con
gress for capiiol purposes. None of this
lana has been sold, and warrants have not
been salable without the State guarantee
of interest. Excepting the foundation the
capitol has remained unbuilt.
The bill recently passed provided for re
ducing the cost of the edifice to $500,000,
and the State was to guarantee 4 per cent
interest on half that amount. Governor
Rogers declares that a building erected for
that, sura by modifying the original plans
would be an eyesore and a disgrace. He
therefore vetoes the measure, which means
that entirely new plans must be procured
if the next Legislature two years hence
orders the capitol built.
The present frame Statehou9e at Olym
pia was built nrativ years ago, and could
be duplicated for $2000. The State offices
are located in a rented brick building.

Third Trial of an Alleged
Wife-Poisoner Ends in
Acquittal.
Portland Jurors Decide That W.
E. Ellsworth's Innocence
Was Proved.
Escapes the Hangman's Noose After
a Ssries of Sensational
Prosecutions.
PORTLAND, Oregon, March 2Lâ W. E.
Ellsworth, accused oi having killed his
wife two years ago by strychnine poison
ing, is a free man. He had three trials.
At the first the jury disagreed; on the.
second a verdict of manslaughter was
brought against him and he was sentenced
to fifteen years' imprisonment, bat the
Supreme Court reversed the judgment and
his third trial was taken np three weeks
ago, resulting in his acquittal by a jury
this morning. It was a case that at
tracted as much attention here as did that
of young Dr. Cariyle Harris, who, about
two years ago, vraa electrocuted in New
York for poisoning his young bride while
she was attending a seminary.
Mrs. Ellsworth died on the morning of
February 10, 1895, under renditions so
peculiar as to justify a coroner's inquest.
The testimony given here by Dr. Her
bert Carawell, who had attended Mrs.
Ellsworth a few hours before her demise,
was so incriminating as to cause her hus
band's arrest three days later. Dr. Card
well's suspicions were aroused after tbe
death, and a subsequent examination of
the contents of the stomach was made by
Dr. Mineus, who claimed to hare discov
ered the presenco of a small quantity of
strychnine. The circumstantial proof
againit the defendant was dangerously
strong. Even the dying declaration of
the woman tended to the belief that she
bad been given strychnine by her hus
band.
Another strong point made by the prose
cution was the in trod action of testimony
to the effect that, several hours before
Mrs. Ellsworth's death, tbe accused had
written and mailed letters to friends an
nouncing the death oi his wife.
The supposed motive for the alleged
crime was Ellsworth's infatuation for an
other woman. Ellsworth is a young man
about thirty years old. and formerly lived
in New York, Casper (Wyoming) and St.
Louis. He worked on newspapers as an
advertising solicitor.
POMONA'S AGED SUICIDE.
Exciting Events in the Career of Octo
genanan L liy. Who Recently
Shot H mself.
LOS ANGELES. Cal , March 21.â D. R.
Lily, the octogenarian who committed
suicide at Pomona a fow days ago, was
said to have been a lelative of John C.
Calhoun. He came from South Carolina
and arrived in California in 1849, after
which he wa3 concerned in many of the
exciting events of tlie new El Dorado's
early days. In 1860 he had drifted to Los
Angeles and was serving under General
(then Captain) Winfield Hancock in a
company of United States troops.
In 1847 Liliv became involved in trouble
with Key. .Benjamin Standerfer, who was
a minister of the Christian church and a
brother-in-law of T. D. Holliday, who was
well known in this county. They met one
day in a saloon in Spadra and Standerfer
attempted to horsewhip Liliy. The latter
drew a pistol and shot Standerfer througn
the heart His case was taken into court,
but he was acquitted on the ground of
self-defense.
Lilly left one daughter, Mrs. May Lilly
Hardy, who is said to have been the firat
American child born in what is now Po
mona. The revolver with which Lilly
killed Standerfer is said to be the earn*
that he used to take his own life.

STEADY GROWTH
OF WATSONVILLE
Thriving City Nestling in
the Fertile Pajaro
Valley.
Much of Its Progress Due to the
Establishment of a Sugar
Factory.
Farmers Derive Large Ice ni3s From
the Product of Their Ex'emiv.s
B?et Fields.
"WATSON VILLE, Cal., March 20.â 1f
Balinas is the most conppicuous example
of a California town about to do something
Hew, Watsonville stands as the most strik-
ing object lesson of achievement along the
lines of modern growth.
Ever since the establishment of the great
beet-sugar industry here in 1888 the growth
of the town has been steady and substan
tial. Without the noise and pretense of a
boom the country has taken on a substan
tial erowlh. Peopie take aprMe in point
ing to additions to the town â places that
were nurseries or fields a few years ago,
now dotted with many beautiful home?.
There is a substan tial element about every
thing here and a charming absence of pre
tense among the people.
"I have friends and neighbors who last
year made as much as $150 an acre out of
their orchards," said lowa Tuttle, one ol
the prominent young ranchers here, a far
seeing resident who was formerly a sur
veyor of Oakland. H& is now engaged in
raising hops in a large way and on a
profitable basis. This fact illustrates the
great diversity of resources of this rich
â oil.
Santa Cruz County is famous for its
superior apples and peaches, also for a
peculiar grape, yet its soil has shown the
most wonderful productiveness of the
sugar beet. The sunshine and rain blend
beautifully here for the beet crop, aud it
is everywhere apparent that beet raising
has given impetus ana tone to commercial
transactions in this vicinity.
Directly it has been a great benefit to
large clafses of the population â a few
hundred employed in the factory and
twice as many more in the fields; Out the
beet business has also stimulated men to
new endeavors in other lines of industry,
benefited every business and promoted
the general welfare of the people.
The stranger here hears many stories of
the prosperity that comes to tbe people
"when the factory is running," which
means about fivÂ« months each year.
Farmers from all sections drive in with
loads of sugar beets, and it is a common
sight to behold a line of wagons that
reaches a mile from the factory blockad
ing the streets. In their haste to be served
promptly farmers get up soon after mid
night, drive to the factory gates, and wait
in line until the gates open at 7 a. m.,
when their products are received and
weighed.
The direct and stimulating effect of
such a movement of farm products is fe!t
throughout all the ramifications of com
mercial life. Hundreds of thousands of
dollars are annually put in circulation,
debts are paid and new enterprises are
undertaKen with confidence. Thi9 in part
accounts for the evidences of thrift
abounding in the town and over the popu
lated areas of highly cultivated soil con
tributory to this thriving entrepot. A
casual study will convince one that Wat
â onville is tbe natural commercial center
and distribution point for a large and fer
tile area. That is why sturdy business
men have settled here, remaining year
after year with unabated faith in the
future of tbe connty and it 3 legitimate
commercial capital.
There are many things, aside from the
attractions of commerce, that make Santa
Cruz County at once a pace for enjoy
ment and wonder. The beautiful territory
lies on the north shore of Monterey Bay,
and is a strip of scenic grandeur and fer
tile soil forty miles long and but fifteen
miles wide at its greatest extent. To the
northward tho picturesque Santa Cruz
Mountains separate it Irom Santa Clara
County, while to the west is San Mateo,
and east of it San Benito and Monterey.
A recant eloquent writer, Philip Francis,
The Mansion Hotel, Watsonville*
has aptly describe 1 the area of which
Wa sonville is readily the commercial cap
ital in the following striking language:
"It is a countj' of gently rising terraced
mountains, winiinz streams, fertile vat
leys, and a level, hospitable seacoast. Its
area is 320,000 acres, nearly all capable of
cultivation."
The 40,000 acres of bottom lands in this
county aÂ»re extremely fertile, producing
almost everything known in the semi
tropics. This great and fertile region of
lowlands is watered by clear streams
whose source is the peaks of snow. From
the beautiful shoreline of the ocean more
than 50,000 acres of inarvelously rich
farming lands rise in terraces to the peaks
of the mountains, on the high altitudes of
which grow the grapes from which are
pressed the wines that have made this
country far-famed.
One of the most noticeable characteris
tics of the people whom one might desig
nate as men of affairs hereabouts, is a com
plete absence of the spirit of bravado and
bluster They remind one of the first men
of the earth, as described In the legends of
Gauiauma, "who ate of the earth and
found it delicious," and who stood firmly
on their feet as if they had as much
license as the mountains and the sea. It
is generally an evidence of narrow experi
ences and petty triumphs to see the brag
gart element in village life.
George Alfred To*aÂ«end was wont to
say in h s famous "Oath" letters, that men
who 'alked too much about their town and
its alleged achievements were like empty
barrel?, making a noise b;causeof the very
emptiness of their pretenses.

perity here of course, but understands the
reasons therefor only in a vague and un
certain way. A study of a few facts rela
tive to that part of tbe progress due to
tbe beet-sucar industry sets to flight a
multitude of idle guesses. Before view
ing this phase of the question it should
be stated with emphasis that while the
beet-sugar industry has achieved won
ders and vitally aff cted many branches
of trade, it is but one of the important
sources of revenue to the people.
Vast sums have been realized from
orchards and fields and from the many
forms of industry wholly independent of
suear. Yet at the bottom of all there re
mains the fact that the big factory by the
depot has given confidence to tho masses
and inspired many a successful man to
undertake enterprises remotely akin to
the raising of sugar beets.
Assistant Superintendent Morse of the
sugar-bet factory, in a conversation yes
terday, gave some interesting details about
the business that has for the past nine
years p!ayed so important a part in lccal
commerce.
"We employ about 200 men here stead
ily," he said, "and as most of them are
men of families I think it is safe to say
tbat 800 or 900 people really earn their
livelihood at the factory or through those
working here. This is really equivalent
to the population of a good-sized village.
"From 11,030 to 12,000 acres of land are
steadily under cultivation for beets, but
to effect this purpose fully 35,009 acres
must be subject to control on the plan of
alternating crops. Probably fully four
hundred farmers are directly interested
in beet raising, while several hundred
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 22, 1897.
more are at it indirectly, planting beets
in their orchards. Thus you will sea that
a large number of people are benefited in
an indirect way by the raising of beets.
"My experience here since 1837 rather
convinces me that one of the chief bene
fits of the enterprise has Deen to break
the big gralnfields up into small holdings.
If that is what has aided some of the
countries of Europe it may benefit this
country in a like way."
It is worth more than pnsning attention
to consider one or two features of the
beet-su^ar question as it baa affected
Watsonville. Last year this busy institu
tion made 19,528 tons of sugar for con
sumption in America, consuming more
than 155,000 tons of beets. The average
tons raised to tbe acre was 14.06 and the
price paid $4 a ton, or $36 24 to each acre.
While other crops have often paid better
tnan this, particularly old orchard*, it
should be borne in mind that the beet
crop is quickly raised and rapidly con
verted into casn.
When one stops to estimate the benefits
conferred on many small farmers by the
annual distribution of money by the fac
tory it will be found that the new indus
try has driven want from many a door,
given employment to many a wuyfarer
and added to many a purse the modicum
that lifts the owner from penury to com
fort. Its benefits are still growing and are
sure to be far-reaching in their uff9Ct3 on
society at large.
The casual observer, traveling from
town to town to study its features, sees
things as they are. but he loses tha view
of things that belonged to the past. In
lieu of such a generalization he must de
pend upon others and must behold things
from theu 1 view-point.
Nobody here has a clearer idea of things
that John T. Porter, president of the P*.
jaro Valley Bank. He came here in 1853
ana has had a wide experience in the com
mercial world. He is a man of liberai
views, and his conclusions from observa
tion are those of a man cf wide experience.
I asked him some vary pertinent ques
tions about the country, and his answers
were interesting.
â¢'What is the outlook for the masses
here," I asked him, "as compared with
what it was ten years ago?"
"Hundreds of per cent better than at
any time I can remember," he said. "If
it had not been for the beet sugar factory
grass would be growing in the streets here
The Pajaro Valley Bank Block, Watsonville.
to-day. It was the only thing to save the
country. You see tbe lumber business
had gone to pieces after the ola cornnany
was absorbed by the Lonia Prieta. I
know that hundreds of woodcboppers and
others were thrown out of employment
and afterward found a livelihood in the
beet sugar business, either as workmen in
the fac cry or as producers of the beet."
Mr. Porter has lately traveled over the
coast and has made a comparative study
of locations. Speaking of his travels yes
terday he said : "I have been from the
Colorado to Oregon, and I find no such
healthful, growth in any town as right
here in Watsonvitle. I think more terri
tory has been devoted to residences and
'more houses have been built here than in
any town in California, in spite of the fact
that there is a class that oppose* all im
provement?, preferring to live from the
income of mortgages and the earnings of
other people."
A common complaint of the people here
is that the conventional railroad reports
show Watsonville an.l the Pajaro Valley
at a great disadvantage, bpcause the rt
pons of shipments of products are cred
ited to the division or terminal point
rather than io the locality where product*
were raised. In this instance therefore
San Jose gets the credit for products that
were raised here in tbe vast territory con
tributory to Watsonville.
To give one an idea of the productiveness
of this rich valley it may be stated that in
1895 there were shlppe-l from here 128 596
boxes of fruits, making 238 carloads. This
is exclusive of 750 Carloads of apples,
stone fruits and berries shipped during
the same period to Unn Francisco
and other California points, making
a total ol about 1000 carloads. It
should be borne in mind that the ship
ments of beet sugar during the same pe
rioJ amounted to 1000 carloads.
Coming to the town of Watsonville
proper it should be remembered that it
has a population of about 3500. The prin
cipal business houses are elegantly located
on four wide thoroughfares facing a
beautiful public square or plaza, from
which other arteries of trade and residence
streets run. The plaza is one of the at
tractive features of the town.
The streets are paved with concrete and
macadam and the driveways are kept in
eood repair. The town is lighted with gas
and electricity, the companies which fur
nish the service beinc fully up-to-date in
all they do.
For some years it was a battle whether
the city would have modern lights, but
progressive ideas won in the fight, and
th c city has been up to date ever since.
The educational facilities are equal to
\hose of any town in the State, the Hieh
School being one of the most beautiful
and convenient structures west of Danver,
at once the pride of Watsonville and the
admiration of strangers.
It has long been a motto here that hos
pitality, courtesy and sociability consti
tute the religion ol the people. As a re
sult it is a town of clubs and fraternal or
ders, churches and newspapers. Nearly
every worthy soc al and fraternal order is
represented here, whilechurches of nearly
even- denomination thrive.
In 1895, according to the rpcords of the
Fire Department, fifty structures were
built here at a total cost of more than
$143,000. There are many evidences that
there will be considerable ouilding this
year, and the people are broad enough to
believe that the coming prosperity of Sa
linas and the valley wherein it nestles
wil I benefit rather tnan hinder the people
of Watsonvilie.
Good climate is so common along this
coast that the people liere <lo not really
appreciate the ueneb'ts it confers on crops
and people. The town is just far enough
from the bay and from Leautiful Santa
Cruz to render life enjoyable at all sea
son?. If one tires of the monotony of the
work-day world it is but a trifling run to
Santa Cruz, where strangers throng the
surf and where are all the charms of a
wa'erinw-place.
It is evident from any rational vierv of
conditions now working here that the
products of the future are to be more
diversified and profitable than now. With
prunes, apples, apricots, sugar beets, hops
and o:her profitable thiucs that grow here
with utmost riotous luxuriance, there is
no danger that the confidence in this
region's luture is misplaced. The future
is certainly a land of promise, and it i 3 no
vtondur that those who know the resources
that lie hid and expectant see the rain
bow of hope just beyond.

CHICAGO, 111., March 21.â Jame? Mc-
Mahon of Evanston was stricken with
paralysis yesterday just as it was moved
in the Republican City Convention of
Evauston that he be nominated for Super
visor. He fell unconscious to the floor in
his room and is now lying at tne point of
death.
The news that Mr. McMabon had been
stricken reached the convention hall just
as the ruo.ion to adjourn was passed. All
of the other nominees were pres

tions from their friends. The chairman
rapped for order and made the announce
ment. From congratulations the mem
bers of the convention turned >o discuss
sally the misfortune which had befallen
their venerable associate.
He was one of taÂ« number that crossed
the plains in '49 for the California gold
fields, where he amassed a fortune in a
few years. From California be removed
to the South, where he purchased a large
cotton plantation. At the outbreak of the
war, however, his plantation was
abandoned and he came to Chicago,
where with T. 13. Bryan he formed a part
norsuip in the insurance business.
Thi* prospered and soon he had re-
trieved the fortune which the breaking
out of the war had taken from him.
The Chicago fire proved as great a mis
fortune for McMahon as had the Civil
War, for in the ereat lire he .'ost every
thing. After the tire he removed to Evan
ston, where he has since liv<Â»d.

BIG "JIM" WENT TO THE FIRE.
He Answered a Second Alarm and Had
No Trouble in Finding the Blaze.
"Jim," the big third horse of engine 39,
at Fourth avenue and Seventh street, is
getting many a kindly pat and woru these
days on account of the feat in which he
figured as a hero last 'Wednesday. Engine
39 is a large one and "Jim's" services as
third horse are required on account of its
beintr so heavy to draw. On Wednesday
it was at the repair-shop, and being out. of
commission a smaller engine was sent 10
the house of No. 39 to take its place. The
substitute engine is easily drawn by two
horses and as a result "Jim" received a
vacation. On Wednesday an nlarm of fire
was sounded from the box at First -street,
near Fifth avenus. This was in No. 39's
district and the engine responded to tlie
call, leaving "Jim" chained in bis stall.
Soon a second alarm was turned in on
tbe same fire, and tbe goog in A'o. 39
engine-house sounded with the rest. As
soon as the bell began to strike big Jim's
ears suddenly straightened, and before the
last sound haG died away witn a mighty
wrench he had broken his chains, rushed
out of the house and was on his way to the
fire. Just bow he iound the fire is the
marvelous thing that the firemen are all
talking about, but he d.d find it, and soon
galloped up to t c engine and stood in
what would have been his place had the
regular engine been in use. In their aston
ishment at Jim's sudden appearance the
firemen connected with engine No. 39 al
most forgot that there was a fire to be put
out. He was blanketed and escorted home,
and is now the hero of the fire department.

ETERNAL
VERITIES
The Roman Catholic Church of St.
Peter, on Alabama street, which has been
completely renovated, and has had the
iuterior most elaborately frescoed and
otherwise beautified, was again opened
for worship yesterday. A solemn high
niasÂ« was celebrated at 10:30 a. m., at
which the most Rev. Archbishop Rior.ian
preached. In the evening there were
solemn vespers, the sermon on that
occasion being delivered by tha Rev.
Father Yorke. The church was crowded
At both services.
The high mass in the morning was ren
dered doubly impressive by the excellence
of the musical programme, which com
prised the "Kvrie," "Sanctas" and "Ag
nus" from Mozart's "Twelfth Mass";
'The Credo," from Millard's mass in B,
and the "Benedictus," from Cimorosa's
mass. The organist and director was
Miss Mamie Cconan, and the choir con
si>te 1 of the following:
Souranos, Miss N. Giusti, Mrs. J. Knight,
Mrs. J. T. McDonald, Miss Amanda Cor
coran and Mrs J. Owens; altos, Miss E.
Krieg, Miss M. Malone, Miss A. Sullivan,
Mis* A. Xendrick, Miss L. Kiordan;
tenors, T. Nowlan, J. Stantini, G. Mati'.ie
and J. C. Flood; bassos, Charles Deane,
Carl Secy, J. C. O'Donnell, J. Edmiuster,
T. Macrtuley and James Hictey.
The ArcD bishop presided at the mass,
xiui itev. P. S. Ca'.ey, pastor of the church
*:nce Us foundation, was the celebrant.
He was assisted by Rev. James McDonald,
deacon; Rev. Wiiliam Lyons, subdeacon ;
Rev. I. E. Mulligan, masterof ceremonies.
In the sanctuary attending the Arch
bishop were Father Varsi, S. J.. Rev. Â±*.
t'urumings, pastor of St. Charles; Father
O'Ryan. Father Connolly of St. Paul's and
Father Lynch of St. James.
The Archbishop's discourse was in effect
a splendidly eloquent apology â using the
word in i;s theological acceptation â for
the esihetici? m of tue Catholic ceremonial.
He said in part :
"In reopening this your parish church,
complete in the details of its architecture
and beautiful in the lavish adornment of
its wails, the thoughts and feelings are re
vived of many years ago, when we en
tered it for tne first time and with solemn
Ci remomes dedicated it to the service of
divine worship. We are glad to-day that
the work begun then is at last completed
to the honor and glory of God.
"My firsi words are of congratulation to
your devoted pastor, wiio has directed iiis
efforts to supply the material needs oi the
parish without neslecting its spiritual
needs, and to his assistants and the people
of the parish, who have always b?en ready
to second his efforts and give unto the
houÂ«e of the Lord some of the means with
which Almignty God has endowed them.
"Even a superficial reading of the his
tory of the church of Christ shows that
wherever trie church exists under normal
conditions at peace and in an atmosphere
of liberty and permitted to put forth her
activities from the beginning to the pres
ent day, those activities, wnile they have
displayed themselves in many depart
ments of life, have, above all, displayed j
themselves in the noblest, stateliest and
most costly buildings, and have sur
rounded our worship with all the adorn
ments that music or art can contribute.
"In the music and the liturgical observ
ances which mark out different parts of
the year, joyous or severe, full of jubila
tion or of sorrow, we see manifestations
of the Catholic Hie which, to the Catholic
mind, are indications: of the will of our
divine master. To those who assert that '
the intellect should alone be appealed to,
I reply that man is a composite being to
whom impre-sions are conveyed through
th* senses, which are the feelers of the
intellect. Both a spiritual and a material
temple are necessary. God's cnurch is
not built for a day nor for the pa?sine
needs of human nature. It is the neces
sary equation between God's mercy and
the wants of man, and so the external en
vironment of Christian truth and of
â¢Cnrist's church should bear a character
of stability and permanence, binding to
eether in one communion the past, the
present and the future."
Father Yorke, who preached in the
evening, also referred in complimentary
terms to the completion of the church
and availed himself of the opportunity to
ciiticize those who are wont 10 cavil at the
manner in which the Roman Catholic
Church spends money on its religious
establishments. Some of those critics, he
paid, were emulating the spirit of Judas
I*cariot, who. when Mary Magdalene
poured the precious ointment upon the
head of the Savior in the hou=e of Simon
the Leper, objected to the action as ex
travagant and wasteful.
"So to-day," continued the speaker,
"there are some men who look upon this
church and churches lite it and say : 'For
what purpose is all this waste? In these
hard times the money might be better
employed in relieving tne needs of the
poor.' Our answer to them is the same as
was given by our blessed Lord to the mur
murers in his nay. It is <lone for His sake.
Does the beautifying of God's house inter
fere with charity? It does nor. The
church which spends money for this pur
pose is the church which always spends
more upon the Door of Jesus Christ than
any other institution.
"No charitable organization can parallel
the work or the holy sisterhood for the re
lief of tne sick and suffering, a work whose
vame cannot be estimated in dollars and
cents. Those who give stingily to the
church give stingily to the poor, and those
who give generously to the church are
those whose hearts are never hardened
against the appeal of tne deserving."
The preacher justilied the magnificence
of Catholic churcbei on the' ground that
thc-y am houses of God, and undertook lo
prove the unmistakable nature oi the real
presence and the docirine of transubs'an
tiation by the express declarations of
Christ himself to that effect.
Dr. Wells on the
Marriage Relation.
At the Second Unitarian Church last
nignt the pastor, Uev. Dr. Wells, deliv
erfd the iirst of two lectures on raarriaca,
his special subject being the place of
niarsiaeo m nature. I: was an attempt to
find the rules of this human relation.
"Two causes," he said, "operate to im
pair the famiiy â the loss of faith in the
sacredness of marringe and the growth of
individualism. By so much as the influ
ence of the family declines sj much doea
the order of society suffer, and in self
â¢ governed nations the impotence of politi
cal forces to stand alone iÂ» disclosed.
Nature is domestic in her purposes.
Many of the birds and beasts pair, and
tiie orinciple of sex is established far
down in the vegetable life."
After tracing the evolution of man and
showing the development of the two-fold
form of the individual, the speaker
pointed out certain causes of dissonance
in married life. First, the habit of semi
tleef-ption.
"Young people." he said, "wear a mask ;
they put on an appearance. In the most
simpl 6 life oi the country this is not pos
sibie but in the city there is the restraint
of convention. The result is that they
know little of each otherâ less than noth
.ng. Often courtship is a game of cards,
?Â» which it ia of first importance not '.ore
| veal the hand. But the revelation is made
at last ana they rind that they both en
deavored to cheat nnd did wnat they in
tended. The second cause is mistaking
fancy for love. The attraction that ends
in marriage, should be an inner rather
than an outer fitnes". If not, a mistake is
made for which life will not be long
enough to repent in and get riguted.
"The life of the mau and the maid must
be an ever closer interlacing of tastes,
sympathies and affections, or the founda
tion is laid for a thousand petty irrita
tions.
"Another cause of dissonance is the
inequality assumed to exist and which
places the woman at a disadvantage. A
more radical reason is the quality of the
high contracting parties. The truest
wedded life can only come out of the
truest unwedded life. Make the skeleton
soul without trust and it will be unequal
to the fulfillment of the marriage vows.
Given the manly character and womanly
fidelity, given the love which is the seal of
Almighty God upon a relation toward
which nature has traveled for ages and we
ha*e naturs's'foundation for the family."
The Literature of
The New Testament. |
Rev. William Rader of the Third Con- |
gregational Church preached the second I
of a series of sermons on "New Testament
Literature." He said in part:
"Paul was not a theologian. His writ
ings contained no system of thought, no
studied arrangement of ideas. They were
not an unbroken chain of thought, but a
casket of jewels thrown together out of a
great soul, which apprehended certain
truths and uttered them. He was not a
philosopher, yet he had a philosophy.
"The source of Paul's theology is found
in his conversion. He was educated a
uigot. After his conversion lie preached
the universal love of God. It is impossi
ble to limit this divine love. The history
of religion is an exhinition of its constant
overflowing the narrow boundaries set by
men. God is not a God of one race, but of
all race?. This is proved by the experi
ence of Jonah, of Philip preaching to tne
eunuch, the conversion of Cornelius and
the ministry of Paul. The question which j
Paul took as the text of his theology was. :
â How can a man bacarue right with God?' j
"This is his starting point. He declares i
tnat both Jew ana Pagan come short of I
the righteousness of God ; that a Jew with !
his brok?n law i* little different from a
paean with his Bible written on his con
science. He preached in answer to his
question, righteousness and faith. He be- ]
lieved that men are not to be made right j
! with God by ceremony or ritual or a blind j
I obedienca to law, whether written orun- |
j written; that religion is a life; that salva- \
tion is the character of God, and that this j
character is received through faith, wnich j
is the power to soe and receive the invisi- I
ble. He believed that this righteousness is |
not a barrier but an invitation from God to I
man, and that men are good in proportion |
to the degree of this righteousness in j
them; and that as a proof of God's will
ingness to be merciful, and to extend his
own character through faith to the world,
he has given liis Son in demonstration, |
in whose sacrifice 'we love him because !
he first loved us.' The theology of Paul
Is that of justification by faith rather than j
righteousness by law.''
The Love of God Is
Infinite and Eternal
"Divine Love and Wisdom â How Can
They Be Reconciled With tne Existence
of Evil and Misery?" This was tde theme
of Rev. J. S. David's sermon at Washing
ton Hall yesterday morning. In the
course of his remarks be said:
"It is a revealed truth that God is love.
And as ne is infinite his love is infinite;
and if infinite it is universal. He loves
his enemies. If infinite it is also eternal,
and cannot diminish or change. He can
not love his enemies in this world and
hate them in the other world.
"But if God is infinite and eternal love
how can evil and misery exist? The
sun cannot tend forth rays of
frost and darkness, and ye:, ice
bergs could not exist if the sun did
not exist. The sun gives birth to planets
and when the poles are turned from the
sun the water congeals into ice.
"Likewise the Lord cannot give forth
rays of evil and falsity, of misery and
death; and yet these could not existinde
pendently of the existence of God. He
evolves the human will and understand
ing, but when these are turned away from
him the will stiffens into self-love and the
understanding darkens into falsity. Man
is a free agent, the arDiter of his own des
tiny, and he is destined to go wherever he
wills to go. He is operated upon by di
vine influence?, ever seeking to draw him
tenderly upward, but he is never com
pelled. To compel him would destroy his
individuality and make of him a machine
or a nonentity ; ana it is better to be a
devil than a nonentity, for a devil can be
of use to the human race, but a nonentity
cannot. Evil spirits are our tempters,
and we sre regenerated by means of iemp
tations. It is indeed a negative use, but
it is a use all the same. If they should
cease to be useful they would cease to ex
ist, for nothing can exist save for a use."
Rev. F. R. Farrand's
Story of Esther.
In the Howard Presbyterian Church,
corner Oak and J3aker streets, ihe pastor,
Rev. F. R. Farrand, preached the sixth
and last of a series of sermons on "The
Story oi E3ther."
His subject was "The Tables Turned,
or Retribution" (Esther vii:10). He
said it is hatd to realize the amount of
wickedness tn?re is in the world. Even
the wicked will be confounded by the
enormity o! tbeirown misdeeds. Yet such
ignorance does not absolve from responsi
bility. It was Xerxes' business to have
known the reach of his fatal edict.
"Like all arrant blasters and mean
nun, Hanian was a coward. His plea for
mercy was met. by tho King's order to
bang him on the gallows he had prepared
for ilordecai. Behold the irony of fate!
How arÂ« the tables turned! Mordecai has
the crown while Ham;in has the cross.
In the moral government of God there is
the element of retribution. However
much wickedness may seem to flourish
and escape the consequences of it 3 evil
deed?, a time will surely come when tho
righteous judgment of God will consume
its doers.
"But I thank God that while this fact of
retribution is here made plain, this story
makes equally plain the most tressed fact
of mercy. The pure and Esther,
kneeling before the throne of Xerxes â
her life in the balance â tearfully pleading
for the lives of her people, and the golden
scepter of mercy resting over her, is a
beautiful type of our advocate with the
Father, Jesu-s Christ, the righteous.
"But the type pales before the anti-type.
Esther's life was not required. Chri-st
liied for you and me. The people for
whom site pleaded bad done nothing to
merit the King's displeasure. We all

The Resurrection
Of the Lord
A large assembly greeted the English
evangelist at the First Baptist Church
yesterday morning on his return from Los
Angele? and the south, where for two
months he has been holding very success
ful campaigns.
The suliject chosen was in connection '
with the resurrection. The preacher
showed how difficult it was tor the dis
ciples in the Apostulic days to receive the
transcendant truth which is at once the
glory and proof of the Christian revela
tion. In giving an exposition of Luke,
chapter xxiv, the facts indicated were
clearly illustrated.
"We do not," said Mr. Varley, "take
kindly to the great doctrine of the resur
rection by reason of our present life, our
senses and our environment." The
preacher showed that it became neces
sary for the Lord first to open the under
standings of the disciples ; second, to open
the Scriptures to them concerning the great
fact; third, to open their eyes, especially
the eye of the mind; fourth, to open their
hearts for his own incoming. The knowl
edge of fellowship with Christ in resur- j
rection, said Mr. Varley, needs a divine
instructor, and in every experience the
Lord himself must be the revealer and
teacher. The subject of the resurrection
was shown to be essentially spiritual.
The union of the oeliever with Christ was
shown to be in his resurrection and not in
nis incarnation. The subject proved to be
of deep interest, and the attention of the
large audience was closely maintained
throughont. '
ADVANCED CUBA'S CAUSE.
Echoes of Saturday Night's Big
Mass-Meeting Still
bounding.
San Francisco's Citizens Aroused in a
Just Cause as They N ver
Were Be for.*.
San Francisco is yet ringing with the
echoes of the mass-meeting that filled
Metropolitan Temple on Saturday night
and sent to the struggling Cubans the
knowledge that the City by the Golden
Gate is heartily in sympathy with them
in their valiant fight for hberty.
Certainly no such gathering was ever be
fore held in this Cit} 1 . There were few or
none of the idle curiosity-seekers who usu
ally attend such meetings merely to get
comfortable seats for the evening and listen
carelessly to the eloquence of the speak
ers. Almost every member of the audi
ence seemed to feel that he or she had a
personal interest in the cause of the patri
ots and the eagerness with which all lis
tened to the addresses and the spontane
ous applause tnat greeted each horoic
name or patriotic utterance testified to
the depth of that feeling.
Many went to the meeting full of sym
pathy "for Cuba, but not exactly knowing
why, except that her men and women
were struggling for liberty. When they
left the big hall they knew just why, and
their interest was vastly increased. They
heard eloquent, logical speakers tell of the
righis of the Cubans and of the indig
nities heaped upon them. They heard
the strong but respectful resolutions that
were passed in behalf of a downtrodden
though brave people, and they caught
the enthusiasm of the thousands who
filled the hall. Then they thrilled and
cheered with the rest and went home to
talk of nothing else but the necessity of
aiding the Cubans and to think only of
plans for doing something substantial in
their cause.
The mass-meeting did vastly more than
just pass those resolutions. It aroused
the people as only such gatherings can
and it set a ball rolling that will not stop
until Cuba is free and received into the
family of American republic*.
FREAK BETS ON FITZ.
Two Barbers Ride Four Blccks
in Wheelbarrtws and
Dine Free.
Comeditn Burk Has a Jolly Time in
Ferris Hartman's Part
at the Tivo I
Market street afforded yesterday after,
noon still another measure of the great
ness of the Carson scrap. A wheelbarrow
bet was paid, and wheelbarrow bets and
peanut rollings are not brought forth on
this earth except when a nation has
been stirred by the hazard of something
that approximates the momentous im
portance of a Presidential election.
There was iots of inn at this Sabbath
wheeling in honor of Robert Fitzsim
nions, but no psychologist or philosopher
to observe its ways and to inquire about
the whys of these strange freaks of human
nature.
A block and a half into south of Market,
at 128 Fourth street, is a flourishing bar
ber-shop, and next door is a flourishing
place of business and pleasure, with
"free hamburger day and night" and
neighborly relations with the tonsorial
palace. W. F. Niedermak, who came
here as one of the Monogram baseball
team of Portland last fall, twirls mus
taches there, and so does E. J. Prell. A
fine young man, named D. A. Desmond,
lomes daily for the laundry work, and J.
Bi;hop. another rine young man, finas
tne barber-shop filling a large place in his
life.
Two weeks of "chewing the rag" over
the light didn't change the deep convic
tion of the two young barbers that Fitz
would knock the head off him and the
certainty of the two other fellows that
Fitz was a "big stiff," and bantering in
Jriendly fierceness brought the serious re
sult that the two that lost were to wheel
the other two around the clock, preceded
by the Oxford string band, and to pay for
a French dinner.
So at 3:30 p. m. Desmond and Bishop,
wearing placards "I bet on Corbett,''
started the trundling of the barbers, who
proclaimed "I b**t on Fi'.z," and tne string
band and the flags helped draw an at
tendant crowd.
The day alter the fight one messenger
boy entertained Market street by wheeling
a comrade from Second street to the City
Hal! and back.
Tivoli theater goers had an extra laugh
last night because John Burke, who was
doing a comedy part at the Orpbeum,
paid his bet with Ferris 1J art man on the
fisht on the Tivoli stage. These popular
comedians agreed that the loser should
play tiie other's part that night, and
feurke paid his bet. He appeared on tne
stage in the first act of ' "Pinafore" in
Hartman's costume, which was twice too
big for him, and without knowing a line
of his nan, while Hartman sat in a box
and enjoyed it.
"Don't laugd," said Burke to the con
vulsed audience, "let the fellow in the box
laugh."
At the end of the second act he hastened
to his own part at tne Orpfteum.

PREPARING FOR A
NEW CONSTITUTION
How the Resolution Went
Through the House at
the Last Moment.
A Defeat That Was Turned
Into a Victory in an
Hour.
The Question to Bj Submitted to the
People Within the Space of
Two Yiars.
Members of the Legislature arriving in
the Cily last evening were occupied in
discussing nothing so much as the consti
tutional convention, provision for which
was made in the last momenta of the ses
sion.
Credit for the passage of the measure is
due they say to James Reynolds more than
to any other one man. Reynolds had been
in Sacramento through almost the entire
session working night and day for the
amendment to the constitution which gave
to the Legislature the power to regulate
taxation.
The bill sprang from the Senate, but got
through the House first with a good easy
margin. When it came to the last
trenches in the Senate a distinct change
in the sentiment of that body toward the
bill was discovered, which was traced
ultimately 10 letters and telegrams from
real-estate men and big land-owners in
this City who feared the single tax might
tind a realization through it. It died in
the Senate, the vote beine 9 to 18against it.
Â« During all his championsnip of this
amendment to the constitution Reynolds
had incidentally called attention to the
involved and binding character of the
constitution itself, how full of legislative
handicap it is. The defeat of the amend
ment, of which he had had reasonable as
surance that it would pass, was a great
disappointment, and came in the lasi
hours of the session. There was one re
courseâthe calling of a convention for the
building of an entirely new constitution.
A joint resolution had already been in
troduced and came up for passage imme
diately after the defeat of the amendment.
Reynolds !>tood in the lobby and saw the
resolution walk through the Senate al
most without opposition. It was a very
satisfying spectacle, after the loss of this
measure upon which he had concentrated
his energies.
Hearing the result of the vole he hur
ried over to the Assembly and arrived just
in time to hear the vote announced de
feating the resolution. A question arose
as to whether a majority or a two-thirds
vote was necossary ior the passage of the
resointion. The chair announced that the
resolution was lost.
Caruinetti made a rousing speech in fa
vor of the chair's ruling. Coombs climbed
to the ciair's place and read the law on
the question, declaring a two-thirds vote
necessary. It was in the last hours of the
session and thÂ« Assembly was in a humor
for trifling. There were motions to "re
consider" and they went through. Then
came questions as to t He prcs< nee of a
quorum and a call of the House was de
manded.
The business draeged in this fashion for
some time. The chair grew weary and
Guy took his place. He. too, became
tired. A motion to raise the call of the
house was made. While the vote was be
iuc counted Guy called for a substitute to
take ttie chair. Keegan volunteered.
Now Keegan is a stancn single-taxer and
was eager to see tho resointion pass. He
announced, although the "ayes" were
almost unanimous, that tha "noes"
seemed to have it.
This struck the easy-humored body as a
good joke, and Keegan, seeing he had
made a hit, dec'area the "noes" had it.
The call ot the House was continued, and
friends of tlie measure were dispatched to
bring in other friends. Reynolds stood
on guard directing the proceedings from
the rear, rallying the friends of the reso
lution and keeping them to their task.
For two hours this sort of thing con
tinued, while the Asseinbjymcn enjoye i
themselves throwing wastebaskeis at eacli
other and making mock motions, with
vow and then moving that the "call of
the House" be raised. At last the requisite
number of vote? were marshaled to carry
the measure and it went throngn.
"Now," said Keegan, "you can raise
th<Â» call as soon as you wish."
Reynolds threw his bat in the air and
declared himself better satisfied than if
the amendment resolution had gone
through.
The question of calling a constitutional
convention will l>e submitted to me ueo
pj j some time before the next session.
If it carries then the next Legislature
will pass a law to that effect and appropri
ating money to defray the expense.
Members or the Legislature generally
seemed to thinK the people would vote in
favor of the bill. The convention would
nave to be held within one year after the
next session, or within three years from
date. In the meantime an active cam
paign of education would be carried on
with regard to taxation, and the new con
stitution would very probably introduce
some novelties in that line.
SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY.
Preparing to Organize Sections
in the San Joaquin
Valley.
A Stanford Professor's Interesting
Address Before the Amer
ican Branch.
The regular weekly educational lecture
of the American branch of the Socialist
Labor party was delivered last evening
by Professor George Krieten of Stanford
University. The processor's subject was
"The First Social Revolution," which he
said wa3 the English social revolt in 1881.
He described the condition of English so^
ciety in the fourteenth century, and par
ticularly the condition of the serfs, the
freemen and the laboring element in
general. Continuing he said:
In 1348-49 a great pestilence, called the
"b.ack death," attacked England and swept
away perhaps as much as one-half of the popu
lation. Theecoiiotnic resultsof tills plague for
the workingman, however, were very good.
Wages more than doubled, while rents sank in
the saints proportion. The land-holding Par
liament strove to destroy these good results
by enacting the statute of laborers, which
forced the worSincman to labor for the sainf)
wages as beiore the plitp.ue. The laborers re
plica by organizing societies of resistance to
this statuteâ the first trades unions in history â
with purposes identical with those of their
modern (successors. Discontent whs rife
throughout the land Â«nd it wanted only an
occasion to cause it to break forth.
This occasion was furnished by the at
tempted coilectiou of an unjust poll" tsx. The
people aro<e and in irresistib.e multitudes
surged on London, it was louud impossible
to withstand them. At Mileend the boy king
Richard il tremblingly granted all their
demands. O:i the following day Wat Tyler,
their chief leader, was lured away from his
men and secretly slain, wnile the insurgents
were induced to leave the city at the supposed
command of their leader himself. But every
one of their demands had to be granted be
fore they would retire.
In like manner dirt the insurrection rage far
and wide over England. In every recorded
case ihe insurgents were granted whatever
they desired.
After the people had thus -retired home In
perfect faith the King's counselors rescind
ed his promises and punished the revolt with
great cruelty -and bloodshed. Nevertheless
its cause^ ultimately gained; serfdom had 1
received its deatb blow.
It was a great social movement, the back
bone oi which was an uprising against serf
dom. Besides this, the rebels demanded a
low limitation of rent, which wouid have
given them economical liberty, free hunting
and fishing and freedom from ail tolls and
oppression. They wished to force the King to
rule by their own instead of his iords' ad
vice.
Several others addressed the meeting,
and atnont them was A. Bersford, the
author of the new socialistic work,
".Philosophy for Wage Slaves," whose re
marks were well received.
M. W. Wilkins will soon depart for the
San Joaquin Valley, wcere he will or
ganize sections of the party in all of the
towns. The wagon will start out with
socialist speakers and literature for propa
ganda work in the last of April.
VISITED CORRAL HOLLOW.
A Party of Capitalists Inspects the Big
Coal Mines Which Are Soou
to Open.
A party of prominent San Francisco
capitalists and merchants returned yester
day from a visit to the Corral Holiow coal
mines, which have just been opened, and
from which fuel will be shipped within
the next few days.
The journey was undertaken at the in
vitation of the San Joaquin and Alameda
Coal Company, which owns the mines,
aurf was in the nature of a junketing trip
to "!Â«w the resources of the vast deposits
of coal that are expected soon to free San
Francisco from the necessity of bringing
iuel from foreign markets.
A portion of the party went to Stockton,
the rendezvous, by boat, and others by
special car, the guests of the company be
iii": escorted to the mine by Superintend
ent John Tread wall. All were vastly in
terested in the big mine, which boasts of
its own railroad to convey its product to
tide water, and spent a pleasent day about
the property.

it has been a subject of general remark
; by all who have visited the Presidio of
j late that the men who are in the
; service are all of a superior class, physi-
I cally and mentally. Of late a jrreatdeal
ot care has been taken in the selection of

Tbera is considerable speculation in
army circles at this time as to what will
be done in view of a change of head in the
War Department. There are some who look
for a change in the Department of Cali
fornia, but as yet it is only a matter of
speculation.
General Alcer, the new Secretary of
War, has made an important ruling re
garding the detail of officers to act as aids
to the commanding general. Under Sec
retary Lamont's ruling aids could only re
main four years away from their regi
ments. In other words. Mr. Lumont took
from general officers a rignt clearly given
them by law to select their own aids. This
week Secretary Aiger considered the ques
tion and decided it by authorizing the de
tail of Captains Michler and Maus to duty
on General Miles' staff.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
â¢ HOSDAY...... ;....... MARCH 22, 1897
The tariff debate opens to-day.
Subscribe to the boulevard fund and
help it along.
Let us vrork together and get the Fed
eral building started.
The next news from Europe may tell a
dreadful story of a war cloud Durst and a
deluge of gore.
The people can afford to be amused by
Democratic blundering on the tariff issue
this time. It won't hurt anything.
It is possible the Democrats in Con
trress may think it necessary to fight ihe
Dingley bill just to let the country know
they are still alive.
Now that we have begun work on the
boulevard let us furnish the money to
complete it. There should be no half
way job in a movement of that kind.
According to the Toronto Globe a bureau
f|r the employment of casual laborers is
to be established by that city, and the re
sult of the experiment will be worth
watcning. We may learn something from
Canada.
General Weyler has begun to treat
American citizens in Cuba with respect
and perhaps will continue to do so now
that Cleveland is out of office, but all the
same it will be worth while to keep a
watch on him.
A Louisville man has been held for per
jury for swearing he owned a lot wortn
$400 when it was shown that the lot was
in a cemetery. It was regarded by the
court as a grave offense and the man is
now entombed in jaiJ.
According to reports from New York
the advertisers in that city are beginning
to abandon the decadent journals of sen
sation and crime because decent people
do not read tneni and advertisements
published in them are of no value.
One ct the forlornest searches on record
is' that now being made by Democratic
newspapers for grounds on which to begin
the opposition and attack on tbe adminis
tration. The search for the north pole is
nothing to it for frigidity and futility.
If it be true as reported that Rudyard
Kipling gets $12 a line for his poetry, he
deserves credit for writing so little. It is
a very high artistic instinct that impels
an author to cut his work short at the
right place when be could make $120 by
adding ten superfluous lines.
It was once the boast of New Yoric that
her marriage laws made access to the
matrimonial state more easy and egress
from it more difficult than did the law of
any other State in tbe Union, but now
the people are weary ol that condition of
things and instead of boasting of the law
are trying to got rid o f it.
A French magistrate who baa been
studying the tramp question in that coun
try has reached the conclusion that
tramps make good soldiers, but are not
good lor anything else. Tiie discipline of
the army, he says, is better for vagrants
than the confinement of jails and he ad
vises that all tramps be enlisted for life.
it is believed that by the beginning of
May there will be a Carlist uprising in
Spain of such proportions that the Gov
ernment will be compelled to recall the
troops from Cuba to protect the throne.
The Cuban patriots have therefore
brighter prospects than ever, and they
may yet have the satisfaction of cele
brating the independence of their country
before the year is over.
An act of the Arkansas Legislature
creates a Railroad Commission with full
power to regulate railroad rates and other
w se supervise the transportation business
ot the State, but enjoins the commission
from doing anything to check railroad
building. It will be interesting to see
li'ow the commission works and how it
earns the salary of its members without
offending snippers or checking railroads.
Josiab Flynt, who claims to bave studied
Criminals- "in the open" as well as in jail.
states in a paper in the Fmntm that he has
failed to find insanity common among
criminals or any Jack of will power
among them. These statements aie in
opposition to the prevailing view that the
criminal is a degenerate and imply that the
<vOrst offender can be roaac to behave
himself by simply teaching him that
crime doesn't pay.
General Vasaos, the Greek commander
in Crete, is playing a very difficult role,
â¢ and* thus far he has managed it with com
plete success. He has held hiÂ« position
in the island, protected the Greek citi
zens,- maintained the prestige of his
country and has given the allied forces
no slightest opportunity for a just cause
of 'offense. It is evident that Yassos is a
diplomatist as well as a soldier and is em
inently the right man in the right place
at this juncture.
It is said tbat the cultivation of teasels,
used in removing the. nap from line
t\ oolen cloths, is confined in this country
to a small district around Skaneateles,
New York. The farmers of no other sec
tion have thought it worth while to grow
.them, and yet it is said they yield an
â¢ivcrage-of 100,000 to the acre and sell from
50* cents to $2 a thousand. The profit is
large anu it would seem to be worth while
for some Californian with land to spare to
try the crop for rariety.
THE TARIPF DEBATE.
The new tariff bill has been reported to
the House and debate on it wili brgin to
day. From the proceedings which fol
lowed the report it seems there will be
much stronger opposition made by the
Democrats than has been expected. Nev
ertheless it is more than probable that
the plans of the Ways and Means Com
mittee will be carried out and the bill
will be sent to the Senate by the first of
April.
The arguments for the bill are so famil
iar to the people that it is hardly worth
while repeating them. For years there
has been a continnous deficiency of reve
nue under the Democratic tariff. That
deficiency now amounts to $203,811,729.
More than that, the expenditures con
tinue 10 exceed the revenues, and until a
new tariff is adopted we shell have a con
tinual increase in the deficiency and a
further necessity for the issuing of bonds.
Under these circumstances it is the
plain duty of Congress to revise the tariff
so as to secure a revenuo ample for the
needs of the Government. In addition to
this, as was pointed out by Mr. Dingley,
these duties must be so adjusted as to
secure ample protection to the many in
dustries of the country which have so
seriously suffered during the past three
years from unfair foreign competition.
It will only be another evidence of the
capacity of the Democrats to blunder if at
this time they make any factious attempt
to delay the prompt passage of the bill.
If the new tariff can be puc into effect by
the first of May instead of the first of
July it will save to the treasury $15,000,
--000 revenue. If the delay takes place, that
sum, and perhaps even a larger one, will
be turned into the pockets of speculators,
who will hasten to import foreign goods
before the new tariff can be enforced.
The element of time is therefore an im
portant one in the problem, and the Re
publicans of the House have good reason
to push the measure forward as rapidly as
possible and to allow no concession what
ever to obstructive tactics.
It is reported from Washington that
while Mr. Dingley is confident the bill
will not be seriously obstrucied in either
House, Speaker Reed is less sanguine.
The Speaker has bad a good deal of ex
perience with the Democrats in Congress,
He is aware of tneir infinite capacity for
doing the wrong thing, and, knowing that
the best thing the Democratic leaders could
do to restore the fallen credit of their
party would be to snow a patriotic desire
to increase toe revenues of the country,
he foresees that they will do the opposite.
The proceedings in the House when the
bill was introduced show that Speaker
Reed is not wholly wrong in his estimate
of Democratic nature, and it is possible,
therefore, that the present session of Con
gress may prove to be a stormy one.
There is a hope the Democrats of the
Senate will be wiser than those of the
House. Certain statements recently
made by the ablest leaders of the party,
such as Senators Gorman, Morgan and
Jones, imply that they will not encourage
obstructive tactics against the bill. If the
counsels of these men prevail there may
yet be clear sailing for the bill despite the
present unfavorable outlook. The Repub
licans of the House, under the leader
ship of Mr. Dingley and the speakership
of Mr. Reed, can be relied upon to make
short work of the obstructives there, and
if tne wiser Democrats of the Senate can
keep their followers in that body quiet we
may yet have the new tariff in time to
celebrate it with the picnics and festivals
of May day;
EAILWAT BUILDING.
The expectation that this will be a year
of extraordinary developments in railway
bu ; ldinjt receives confirmation from all
sides. In every section of the Union new
enterprises are ander way for the opening
of new lines or the extension of old ones.
Even if a large allowance is made for ex
aggeration in the reports of these under
takings, there still remains enough to
justify the belief that the railway building
of the year will be one of the most marked
features of the industrial revival.
The Railway Age recently stated that if
all the projected lines and lines now under
construction are carried out the aggregate
railway building of the year will amount
to over 1700 miles. The greater portion of
this will be west of the Mississippi, with
the State of Texan and Oklahoma and In
dian Territories leading. Several of the
projected lines it is known are designed to
reach the Pacific Ocean, and Caliiornia
has a fair chance of receiving her share cf
the new work.
Confirmation of the belief that many if
not most of these projected lines will be
undertaken is found in the largely in
creased orders for Â«teel rails sent to the
mills of the country. It has been stated
that the records of the American Iron and
Bteel Association show that the total out
put of steel rails in this country in 18%
was 1,102,892 tons. Since the first day of
January of ihe present year, however, tne
mill-owners have received orders for steel
rails aggregating 1,500,000 tons, or nearly
400,000 tons more than were made during
the whole twelve months preceding.
This increase in the order for rails is a
sure proof that many of tbe projected
lines will be undertaken. Railway com
panies do not order steel rails unless they
intend to lay them down. Since the or
ders for the first three months of tbe year
have been so large, it is clear that exten
sive railway construction will soon begin,
and will be carried forward with energy
and dispatch. The large orders already
given may te regarded as the forerunners
of other large .orders to come, and it is
probable tbe output of steel rails from our
mills for tbe year will exceed 2,000,000
tons.
Jt is scarcely necessary to say that the
effects of the new era of railway construc
tion will be felt by all industries in every
section of the country. The large amount
of money that will be pVt into circulation
by the roads will aft'ord wages for thou
sands of workingmen, and will add to the
activity of trade in all circles. We may
not see the accomplishment of the 1700
miles of road now projected, but we are
fa'riy sure tbat most o! them will be begun
and a large proportion of them completed.
EX-SENATOR HILL.
The career of David B. Hill, who has
just become an ex-Senator, ia a promi
nent feature in the study ot the second
great wreck of the Democratic party,
which resulted even as the first one did,
in obedience to the law that a house
divided against itself shall not stand. He
outdid his party in- the matter of disrup
tion, for when it separated into two or-
ganizations he srgregated himself from
both divisions. Then persisting in the
historic declaration, '"I am a Democrat,"
he left the world to infer tbat all other
Democrats had vanished from the face of
the earth. Practically they have done so,
and now ex-Senator Hill will vanish also.
In leaving Washington Hill not only
goes out of office but he goes out from any
further prominence in either National or
State politics. His occupation as a leader
of men is gone. After sixteen years of
political life, in which be achieved much
success, he retires from office to compare
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY. MARCH 22, 1897.
live obscurity, and the sum total of the
sixteen years gives the impression of
failure.
When Hill was in Washington, pro
moted from t&e Governorship of the
greatest State in the Union to the Senate,
the opportunity was his in a way very
open, opportune and large to develop into
the foremost man in the Democratic
party. He was an orxanizer, he compre
hended all the ways of the professional
politician, he had prestige, precedent was
in his favor for a passage from the leader
ship of New York to the Presidency, and
he bad the vast advantage that men
turned to him, expectant of seeing the evo
lution of a leader.
The one thing more needed was a broad
comprehension of the situation â a clear
conception of a remedy for the rapidly
growing dissensions of the party the coun
try had intrusted with power. But this
last faculty was wanting. The man and
the opportunity did not meet because tne
opportunity was higher than the man.
Hill was clever, capable, and doubtless
sincere, but to prevent faction from has
tening Democracy to its fall a quality of
greatness was needed which he did not
possess, and the people put their govern
ment into stronger hands.
It is bard to tell what the future holds
for the man now so completely fallen. He
is worse off than a statesman out of a job.
He is a politician without a party. His
following is gone. He is discredited both
in National and in State politics. He
oould not lead and he would not follow.
He has been tested in a great crisis and
found wanting. His retirement is for life.
AN AMIABLE PRESIDENT.
The Boston Herald, one of the free-trade
papers of New England which supported
McKinley only because it could not accept
the Chicago platform nor approve of the
nominees of the Democratic party in the
last campaign, is now engaged in the task
of trying to weaken the prestige of the
administration by representing President
McKinley as a weak, pliant and unreliable
man.
It says of him that he is "an amiable
gentleman," and warns him that there is
danger in paying too great deference to
men whose influence in the party is mis
chievous. "A velvet glove," it says, "has
its uses in dealing with politicians, but
when a man reaches the Presidency there
should be a strong hand inside it to in
sure the fullest success."
Although these words were use 1 by the
Boston Herald with tne intent of slurring
the President, the country will construe
them otherwise. We have haddurin^ the
administration of Grover Cleveland a suffi
cient experience with men who were not
amiable. The country is well pleased to
know that wa have now a different kind
of man at the head of our National ."(fairs.
An amiable President is exactly the kind
of chief executive which we need al this
juncture.
It is everywhere recognized that the re
quirement of the time is a return to some
thing like that "era of good feeling' which
prevailed during the administration of
President Monroe. We have had too
much in the way of a disturbance of busi
ness by antagonisms on economic ques
tions. A return to prosperity can only bÂ«
fully assured by a restoration of a spirit of
harmony among the people, and to ac
complish that it is esseir. l;tl that the Presi
dent should be a man sufficiently amiable,
generous and conciliatory to set the ex
ample to Congress and to the country.
McKinley fully deserves the title of an
"amiable gentleman." His courtesy and
liberal spirit will unite not. only all fac
tions of the Republican party, but will go
far to put an end to the bitterness of striie
in other parties. He has already shown s
marked ability in the performance of this
task of Harmonizing conflicting interests.
There was at one time grave danger that
there might be serious divisions in the
Republican ranks. That danger is now
virtually past. Speaker Reed, Senator
Flatt and benator Foraker, who were re
garded as possible lenders of a Republican
revolt against the administration, have
found such fair treatment from the hands
of the now President as has confirmed
their allegiance to him and made it cer
tain that they will act loyally in support
of party measure*.
The influence of the amiable President
will extend beyond Congress. It will be
felt throughout the country. There will
be nothing done by the administration to
irritate any class of people, to annoy any
industry, or to aggravate any existing
dissension. Every influence of the Presi
dent will tend lo restore public confidence
and unite the people in a cordial co-opera
tion for the return of prosperity. We
have good reason therefore to rejoice that
a man of this character has been elected.
After four year* of Grover Cleveland an
amiable President will be in tbe highest
degree satisfactory to every citizen.

The Palo Alto, published by the students of

same category; they are not engaged in for a
like purpose; they are not supported by the
same Interest*, ncr do they appeal to the name

and the effort to decry football and boom

futile as it is ludicrous."

sequent distribution of a very large amount of
money. Sugar beets will be another factor in
bringing about a revival of business activity.
The acreage this year will be double that of
189G, and the price has been advanced to a
iigure that will make the crop profitable to the
producer."
According to the following information

said: 'I don't mean that a man can make big
wages, but he can make a little money all
about hereâ on the hills, in the lava beds
and along the river. He may not make over
50 or 75 cents a day, but go where he will he
can always find a little gold. I put in time
when I was out of regular work, when others
would be loafing. I went out with my pick
and pan and got what you see. Anything pays
better than doing nothing at all.' "
Hanford is agitating the project of a cream

doors like untouched placers: "Let's have tne
creamery; but in order to have one the pasture
lands of this county must be stocked with
cows. You can't run a fruit-canniug establish
ment wltn an alfalfa field, neither will raisin
vines supply a creamery with milk. There is
no reason why ail the butter consumed here
could not be manufactured right at home.
We have the land, and land that is better
adapted to dairy farming than anything else.
But it must be stocked, and the stock must be
cared fur and milked twice a day. It Is hard
work, but it pays."

THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir.: Strangers are struck with the magnificence of
our harbor; but as soon as their feet come in contact with our streets they conclude that
though nature has done so much for us, we have done but little for ourselves.
What was said in 1532 of the streets of London, in the first act for paving and improving
that city, can be said in 1897 ot the streets ot San Francisco. The streets were described in the
simply worded statute, as "very foul and full of pits and sloughs, so as to be mighty perilous
and noyous for the King's subjects on horseback, as on foot and iv carriages (litters)." That
description is no exaggeration of the condition of the stroets in this City to-day.
Oilier cities, such as London and Liverpool, England; raris in France, Sydney and Mel
bourne, in Australia, have been experimenting and making large expenditures to ascertain
which are the beÃt Davements.
They nave come to the conclusion that wood pavements, when properly constructed, are
economical, noiseless and dustless.
Being a smooth pavement, it is suited for all -kinds of traffic. Tliov are cleaner than any
other pavements. The liie of wood pavement, on nri average. Is from fifteen 10 twenty years.
According to a table of death rates by Colonel Haywooa, Engineer ox the city of London, it
is shown that in tnose cities in America where wouti pavements have been used extensively
the death rate is less than in cities pavod largely withÂ« istone and other kinds of pavements.
Wherever wooden pavements have been used they are popular.
Albert Shaw, iv "Municipal Government in Continental Europe," says: "The Parisian en
gineers had begun to demonstrate the excellencies of the American Invention, wHh the conse
quence tn lit the extent ot smooth and noiseless wood. paved roadways, so much cheaper than

Our Street Department, up to date, does not accept wooden pavements, though they have
been highly successful In such, cities as London, Liverpool and Paris, which cities have the
best-paved streets in the world. I have been in ttiose cities; looked over the several construc
tions and the manner In which wood pavements are laid.
It is sufficient lor my purpose here to state that the essentials necessary to the construction
of successtul wood pavements may be summed up as follows :
Firstâ An unyielding and impervious foundation.
Secondâ Sound and j-cHsuiied wood, either in its natural state or treated with a preserving
compound (in the proper manner), and blocks of such dimensions as experience has proved to
be most suitable.
Thirdâ An impervious filling between the blocks.
The question of cost is the one which usually interests the taxpayers and is probably the
greatest stumbling-biock in the attainment of good roadways. The one which is truly the
cheapest is the one which makes the most profitable returns in proportion to the amount ex
pended, and experience has proved that where wood pavements have been properly cou
utructed the problem has been solved.
Pavemenis productive of dust and mud, such as we have in Sin Francisco, are objectiona
ble, and especially so on streets devoted to retail trade. Rough-surfaced pavements are noisy
under traffic and insufferable to nervous invalids, aad much nervous sickness is attributed to
them.
Smooth and noiseless pavements enhance the rental value of buildings. Rough and poor
pavements do the reverse.
Our municipality should endeavor to get abreast of the times and give us better streets, so
that no longer it can be said that Ban Francisco has the worst-paved etreets in the world.
Wood pavement has been laid on Market street in front of the Emporium, al&o on East
street, foot of Market street.
We have the very best woodâ California redwoodâ for the purpose. We have no need of
experimenting. Other cities have done that for us. All we have to do is to adupt their mode
ot construction. At present wo have cheap labor, as thousands of our citizens are out oi em
ployment.
What are we waiting for? R. L. RYFKOGEL, 1546 Howard street

CATHOLICS IN THE CABINET.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Dear 6ir: You quote the other day from an Italian
paper to the effect that Judge McKenna is the first Catholic to sit in the Cabinet of a President
of the United States. This is a mistake. To ro no further back, the Hon Augustus H. Garland,
Attorney-General In Mr. Cleveland's first term, was a Catholic. Indeed it - sy be said that
though the Catholic vote of the country was infatuated with Mr. Blame in 1884 and continued
its habit of opposing Mr. Cleveland in 1888 he continued his habit ot making no discrimina
tion ngninst men on account of their religion, for he appointed Justice While, a Catholic, to
the United States Supreme Court, the first member ot that church to hold that office, since

EMBASSADOK AND POET
V.hen Colonel John Hay goes to the Court of
St. Jnmes as an Embassador his fame es a
poet will have preceded him. Perhaps no two
poems won lor their author wider popularity
than "Jim Bluoso" and "Little Breeches."
"Jim Bludso" was lirst published in Boston in
1871, and is as follows :
Wail, no, I can't tell whar be lives,
Because he don't live, you seÂ«:
Leastwise, lie's got out of tue habit
i;f llvin* .ike you and me. â¢
Whar have you been .or the last three year
That you haven't, heard folks tell:
How Jimmy Bludso passed iv hit checks
i he nlghi of the Prairie Belle?
He weren't no saintâ them engineers
Is all much a meâ
One wife in .satchez-under-the-Hill
And another one here in I'lke.
A keerless man in his talk was Jim,
And an awkwaid hand in a row;
But he never flunked, and he never liedâ
1 reckon he never knowed how.
And this was all the religion he hadâ
To treat bis engine well;
JNcvpr De passed on the rlv*r:
To mind the pilot's bell:
And if ever Hie raine Belle took five,
A thousand times he swore
He'd hold her nczzie agin the bank
Till the last soui got ashoie.
All bouts has their day on the Slississip.
And h r d..y come at last;
The Mon astir was a better ooat.
But the telle she wouldn't be passed.
A â  <! so she i ame tearing along that nightâ
The oldest craft on the lineâ
With a nigger squat on hwr safety valve
And her fu:nace crammed, rosin pine.
The fire burst out as she cleared the bar.
And burnt a hole in the ulgh;.
And quick as a flash st<e turned and mad*
For the wMer â Â» iik on the rulit.
There was ruunin'and cursln', but Jim yelled oat,
over all the inferna: roar:
â 'I'll hold her nozzle agin the bank
Till the last galoot's ashore!"
Through the hot, black breath of the burniu' boat
Jim BludEO's voice was heard,
i And all had .rust In his cussedness
And knojved he'd ktep his word.
And, sure's you're bori., they all goi off.
AJore the <<mukesiacks t"--il.
And B udso's ghost went up alone
la the smoke of the Prairie Belie.
He weren't no saint, but at Jedgment
I'd run my chance with Jim
'Loneside of soidh p.ous gentlemen
Thut wouldn't shook hands with him.
Ho seen his duty, a dead-sure thing.
And went for it, thar aud then,
And I'iirist ain't a-soiug to be too hard
â¢ hi a man that died for man.

SPECIAL FLAGS.
Those Prescribed for the President
and the Secretaries of War
and Navy.
Among the special flags of the United States
there is now for the first time one belonging
â¢to the Secretary of War. About eight years
ago a special flag was made for lhe Secretary
of the Xkv)\ and the President has had his
private flaer for many years longer than that.
In addition the new flag for the Secretary of
Flag of the Secretary' of War.
War is of scarlet bunting, the fly measuring
12 feet and the hoist 6 feet 8 inches. In the
center is an eagle with outstretched wings,
bearing upon its breast a United States shield.
The eagle, which is the same as that on the
National arms, holds in its right talon an olive
branch with red berries, and in its left a
bunch of arrows. In its beak is a scroll with
the motto, "E Pluribus Unum." In the field
of the shield are two rows of stars, six in the
upper and seven in the lower row. There is
also a large white star in each of the four cor
ners of the flac itself.
The special flag of the President of the
United States is similar to me one just de
scribed and the new design is evidently a modi
fication of the older one. Ihe only differences
between the two are that the President's flag
is of blue instead of scarlet bunting and lias,
instead ot the four while stars in the corners,
a row of thirteen smaller stars curving around
and above the eagle. The Secretary of the
President's Flag.
Navy has a much simpler flag than either of
the above. Upon the blue field there is an an
chor and the four white stars are in the cor
ners, as in the emblem of the Secretary of War.
With the exception of the flags of the admiral,
vice-admiral, commodore and other officers of
the navy, the three flags described above are
the only special ones belonging to Government
officials.
The use of these special flags is, as a. rule,
confined strictly to ceremonious occasions,
and the natural result' of this is thai they are
unfamiliar to the general public. Wherever
the President's flag fliesitaenotcshis presence
in tne vessel or building over which it is
hoisted. Its employment in the case of build
ings in which the Executive may happen to
be staying is merely optionel, and the cere-

mony is more frequently omitted than ob
served. The n*vnl regulations, however, give
explicit orders for the use of this flag when the
President visits a ship of war. At the moment
when be steps upon the deck the flag is dis
played at the main and is kept flying there as
long as he is on board. A National salute is
fired immediately after the flag-raising. When
the President leaves the snip there is another
salute and the flag is hauled down at the firing
of the last gun. Any snip of war flying the
President's flag is regarded as the senior ship
present and her motions are followed nccont
iugly. When she meets at sea or in harbor
any other United Sta'es ships of war the latter
fire the Nnrional salute in her honor, aud the
siime ceremony is observed by all naval baU
teriei which she passes.

CROWDS AT THE PARK.
Some Slight Casualties â Thousands
Visit the Museum.
The park museum was visited yester
day by a continuous stream of people, and
the register at the gates showed one of

The George Skoltield got away from

The scow schooner Tar and Tartar had

well-known trader, T. F. Oake-.-, from
Hon.kong for New York, has long, be*n
given up ac lost, and 95 per cent reinsur

took 147, days to come from Hongkong to
San Francisco. Both vessels came around

OPENING OF THE TIBURON DRAWBRIDGE.
The Yachts That Were Laid Up for the Winter Got Under Way Yesterday, and as Soon as the
Drawbridge Was Opened Made for Richardsons Bay. The Aeolus Led the Way, and the
Fleet Made a Pretty Picture While Moving: Into Summer Quarters.
T. F. Bonnet, who had defeated Riordan
Thursday afternoon, might give him a
hard battle for supremacy, and the veieran
at once expressed hia willingness to play
him.
The match was played yesterday after
root) and the court was crowded to the
doors, a large number being unable to find
standing room. Every player of any note
in the Ci'y was present, and amonir the
most enthusiastic were Detectives Roche
and Conroy of Sydney, Australia. Several
heavy b'jts were made on the result, but
all were declared off, as the match ended
in a draw. J. C. Nealon acted as scorer
and referee.
The first game was a scorcher, and was
won by Bonnet. Dunne scored the next
two games and Bonnet the fourth. This
left tnem two games each, and it was
mutually agreed to call the match off ow
ing to ti.e tailing light.
A finer game was never seen in the
court, and Bonnet proved that he can tike
rank among the best players anywhere.
He was in splendid form and made good
use of his head as well as his bands. In
the most exciting rallies he used excellent
judgment. The veteran playeil with his
usual coolness and rare judgment and
notwithstanding that he was double the
age of his opponent he seemed as fresh as
a daisy -it the end.

WHAT IS TEEOSOPHY?
Dr. Uharmnpata 1 rphiiii-. That It Is
UiidÂ»'rntood by the Pure Only.
Dr. Dharmapr.ia lectured to a large au
dience at Native Sons' Hall laÂ«t evening,
his subject being "What Is Theosophy ?"
"Tteosophy," ho said, "is that tran>
cendental science which teaches us to lead
a noble spiritual life. It can only be known
by those wlm are pure and unselhsli.
"Tlie spiritual student must put aside
all sensuality and devote his life to the
wot* of uplifting humanity. No man can
selrtheosophical science. The man who
says he cun teach theosophy for
a price has nothing that is worth eivlnjr.
True theosophlsts giveâ they cannot get."
The speaker spoke in highly eulogistic
terms of Colonel Olcutt and Mme. Blavat
sky, and particularly of their work in In
dia, wnore they had taught tiie natives
tneir own forgotten science. Mme. Hiu
vat-ky, he said, bad brought new truths
to the" western world which hnd beeu re
veAlfd to her by the treat masters.
He concluded by counseling his hearers
to devote the energies they were now de
voting to dissipation and pleasure to thÂ»
development of their own individuality
and spiritual nature?.

Arrangements B ing Made for the
Opening of the Park for Ihe
Summer Season-
The California Schuetzen Ciub held its
repular monthly buliseye shoot yesterday
at Schu tzen Park, near San Rafael. The
sun shone bright y, and save for a slight
wind ihe day was perfect. The light on
the targets was good and enthusiasm ran
high.
The Schuetzen Section of the Verein
Eiutracht also held its regular monthly
bullseyo shoot, and the monthly medal
shoot of the San Francisco Turn Verein
took place on the San Rafael grounds.
Philo- Jacoby was at Schuetzen Park

In buliseye *hoot of the Schuetzen

F. Hflgerup, J. Zahn, C. Khlimrer, L.
Schmidt, O. Over, J. Young, C. Uumbel, F.

THE MILITARY SHOTS.
Many Good Marksmen Will Stay
Away From the State Contest.
The contests for the musket and revolver
championships of the State araon; the
members of the National Guard of Califor- '.
nia will be held in Sacramento on next
Saturday. All who in the last spring and i
fall shoots qualified by making 90 per cent
are eligible to contest for State decora
tions.
The arrangements of the authorities for
the big event are anything but satisfac
tory to the military marksmen, who re
gard the contest as more of a dice-shaking
proposition than a test oi marksmanship,
and they believe that the results will
make them the laughing- took of the mili
tary shooters of the United .States.
Ihe reason is this: When they shot for
qualification they were permitted to use
Springneid muskets and Colt's artcy re
volvrrs, with wuich they are familiar.
They were allowed to load their own
cartridges so long as they loaded for tiie
musket with sixty-six grains of powder
ana bullets not weighing less than 405
grains. Their revolver practice was with
such factory ammunition adapted to the
weapon as best suited them.
Under the regulations governing the
contest the marksmen are compelled to
Biioot rifle cartridges furnished by the
State, and the size of the load, weight of
bnllet and freshness of the poivJer are un
known to the marksmen.
The proposition that it is just as fair for
one as lor the other does not hold, lor the
contest is supposed to be to determine
who is the best shot. This can only be
done by letting each shoot under the best

serves the general rules with reeard to

As staled the marksmen regard the com
ing contest more in the light of a dice
shaking game and a large number of the
best shots have asserted that ih M y will
noi go to bacramento and make monkeys
of themselves with strange ammunition.
However the local interest in rifleshoot
ing is not decreased with the militia boys.
A large number were at their favorite
haunt, the Shell Mound range, yesterday.

strong, gusty and chilling.

THE BOULEVARD'S
RAPID PROGRESS
A Good Showing Already
Made on the New
Drive.
Many Visitors Go to View the
Work the M.n Are
Doing.
Th" Vice.President of the Organizd
Uaemp oyed Says TV? Are Will
in? to Work lor $i a Day.
A Jarp;e number of visitors went out
yesterday to see how the new boulevard is
progressing. There were so many car
riages, buggies, bicycles and pedestrians
on the road thither mil back that it some
what resembled a procession. â¢
The work is rapidly going forward. A
big hill has been partly cut down and the
ravine jnst below the Almshouse has been
so iajr titled up that vehicles can pass.
The timber has b-ei cut away for about
an eighth of a mile. Superintendent
Egan says in a week from to-day they
will have completed a mile of the drive
way, and in a few days it will be so far
opened up that a view of the ocean can be
had from the bottom of the hill where the
road passes tne Almshouse.
The hardest part of the grading will be
accomplished with the cutting through of
the first hill, which is now half done. All
they need is more funds to quickly open
up the new drive, for there are plenty of
hard workers ready to buckle down to the
job for a dollar a day.
Chairman McCord says there were 260
men at work Saturday and there will be
300 to-day. They have a contribution box
put iii' on the side of the tool shed so that
the pilgrims out there can help the enter
prise along.
The number of organized unemployed
quartered in the old Armory riall on
Howard street is now reduced to GOO. A
number have found emuloyment and
many have gone away. They had a meet
ing yesterday afternoon in which tUey de
cided to reject the new headquarters the
committee selected for them on Second
street because they were too small. The
place where they now are is so crowded
it is difficult to get all the men fed, be
cause so few can sit at the table at "nee.
The men are sleeping on the bare flour,
most of them with very licht covering
over them and some with none.
Vice-President F. T. Merrill says that
the men are p rfectly willing to work for
$1 a day and will tace any sort of work
offered. There are men, he says, in the
organization representing . nearly all
trades, but they are willing to try to
adapt themselves to any new occupations
thut will eive them a living.
The men have some hopes of hearing
again from an Oregon miner who talked
of employing 150 of them. Vice-Presiaent
Mpiriil says thai three times the number
called lor had offered to go.
The organized men have a grievance
against the Salvation Army, and they
take no interest in the Salvationists'pro
posal of sending them to the country.
They are not p.varse to going to the coun
try uud?r other auspics, however.

The en tertHiument given on two nights iÂ«st

Grand President Sirs. Greenwood.
The assertion has often been made by those who
are opposed to woman being at the bead of a f.aier
nal organization, that she 13 not physically capa
ble of euduring the hardships that such a position
imposes. There is one woman iv a fraternal
organization at this time that is a living proof that
the assertion does noi hold good in every ens*, and
it is doiibttul if there are many of tbe sterner s-x
who would do wi.ling to undertake all thai this
one hÂ«s done since last May.
These remarks refer to Mrs. Marian Greenwood,
grand president of the RebeWab Assembly of this
State, a resident of the city of Stockton. Mrs.
Greenwood was Installed on the 16th of last Way,
and in the early part of June following she was
MRS. .MARIAN GREENWOOD of Stockton, Grand President of the Rebckah
Assembly.
tendered a reception in her borne city, and there
she declared tha. she ould do ail In her power to
aavaneethe order of wuich she was chosen the
head. That her declarations were notmer? Idle
words Is proven by tlie work that she has already
do c. There are 221 lodges In th* State of Cali
lornia. and up to iss: week sh* had visaed 147 of
tliÂ«giÂ». and she is s:!.l engaeri in the work of cast
ing the Minsiiiue uf her presence wherever she goes.
fhc has visited lodges in San Juaquin, >acra
mrnto. Colusi. Butte, Tehama, Yuba, Piacer, Ne
vada, sierra, Amador, Calavera<. Sonoma, Lake,
llumboldt and Uendocino counties in the north
ern, and Contra Los. a, Alameda, San Kraucisco,
Sari;a Clara. Santa Cruz, Monterer. San Luis
Obispo. Santa Barbara, ttanislaus. Merced, Kern,
1-resno, Tolare, Los Ai|e.(i, Kan Bernardino, ijau
UiÂ«KO, Riveriiue and Orange counties in the '
fontli<Â»rn ha.f of the State. In the accomplishing i
of this Mis. Greenwood has traveled 6119 miles I
by rail, 566 by wa?on and stage and 1370 by j
water, a total of 7144 nilies.
During the winter she did not rest, and many a I
mile was made under the most unfavorable cir- |
ciinjstaDces at umeswneu it hailed, rained acid
snowed, yet nothing prevented her from doing to
the fullest the duty she |.i\>mised to pi-, form. On |
one occasion in .Merra County, while traveling in i
anop"n s de-wason, a hsavy suows.orm arose, and
she astej tbf dilverit bn could not let down tbe
binds as a prjtectlon from the snow that was
tiiliriK up on the seat around her. His reply was:
"We'll have 'em on to-morrow."
Before the 10-morrow came her jonrnty was at
an end, aud all the time she wmi surrounded
by snow and cold, and protected only by an od
overcoat loaned her at one of the stopping places
She has endured many hardships that bat few
men would undertake, and has ueen over lonely
parts of the country without, fear or once shrink
ing from the periormameof that duty she believes
si; ou be performed by every one who takes the
holerun obligation she did at the time she was in
stalled.
Another evidence of tier devotion to the cause in
which sbe is engaged lÂ« the fact that much of the
expenses she has been put io in the carrying out of
her work has been met from her private purse.
â ' lie yearly allowance from the assembly is hut
00, and uny one who has moved from one part
of the State to another knows that that amount
will not go very far in the accomplishing of so ex
tensive a journey as Mrs. Greenwood has a- com-
sh-d. and nh'Ch will lake her at least two
months more to conclude. In this time she has
found opportunities to come to this City to attend
sessions of ihe board of trustees of the Home for
Orphans at iiilroy and give time and nuvice in the
management of the preliminary affairs. \V here
ever sbe has been she has iufused bright life into
the lodgirooms.
Her addresses, delivered with a great deal of de
liberation showing careful study, have been ils- '
teued to witn marked attention, and her advice
and suggestions have produced a decided effect on
ail who have listened to her, ail tending to elevate
the order. A few more such unselfish, painstak
ing and devoted-to-duty women in the oraerwouid
'Io much to e.Â»*va;e ii to a still higher plane than
the one it is already on.
In a rf-i ent cony rsatlon Mrs. Greenwood, on the
siibjuctof her visti throughout the M. ate. said:
'â 1 have fouud the loJges that I have vMtcit, with
few exceptions, in a pro'perous condition, financi
ally and . uniencaliy, notwithstanding the finan- i
oa l depression that has bn-u felt ' tbronghont our â 
liml, uud whi c I hiivs enaured many hardships,!
travo'ingove.r rough moi mains and rougher roads, '
in wind. rain and snow, my visitations have be<-n
ver. pleasant, a* well as profitable in experience,
and in thai I f*el fully compensated."
Mrs. <<reenwcod rja.i shov. v by her perseverance,
en?rgy and desire to advance tlie order, of . which
â be v the heal In California, that a woman is
capable of being at the tio.d of a fraternal organ
ization. If mere is any man at Lhe he or such
a:i organization who cau show a better record
than has r.s. Greenwood during thÂ» past ten
months this department will give him fu.l credit.

NOTES THAT ARE
FOR GUARDSMEN
Rumor That Lieutenant-
Colonel V. D. Duboce
Will Resign.
The Sham Battle by the High
School Cadets in Niies

Work of the Signal Corps, Second
BrigaJeâ Reaiy for the Cbampicn
Soootâ The Naval Bittalion.
In tbe i.osue of The Call of last Satur
day was the announcement that tbe
trophy won by the California marksmen in
rhe contest with ihe National Guard of the
Hawaiian Islands bad been received and
acknowledged by Lieutenant-Colonel Du
boce, commanding the First Regiment,
Second Brigade. It bad been intended to
have a public presentation of the troDhy,
but changes in the personnel of the com
mand of the First caused a change in
the projjromme. The trophy will be
handed over to the winners without cere
mony and each of the winn ing marksmen
will be handed an oxidized silver button
for the lapel to be worn in commemora
tion of the victory.
At a meeting of the officers of the First
Regiment of infantry held last Thursday
night Colonel-elect James F. Smith was
in attendance, and was presented to the
board by the lieutenant-colonel, with
vrhom he is on the best of terms.
The colonel elect made a short address
during which be returned thanks for the
election, stated that there wpuld not be
any changes, and that he would do all in
his power to maintain the standard of the
First at the highest.
During the rueetins: there was some talk
by those present of the iieutonant-colonel,
DuDoce, and the nope was expressed that
tie would retain the position he now holds
in the regiment. He was by a number
complimented upou the manner in wnich
he had conducted the affairs of the regi
ment at such times when he was in com
mand of it.
The hope that he would remain were
crompted by a rumor that had been in
circulation that the lieutenant-colonel in
tends to resign, not because of disappoint
ment at not hi v.ng been elected colonel,
but because he does not feel that ha can
remain in a regiment with men under him
in whom he has no confidence, men who
voluntarily made promises to him in thÂ«
matter of election and at ihe eleventh
hour failed to keep th-ir promise.
The licuteuant-colonel refused to talk
about the rumor, declining to either affirm
or deny it, therefore those who are inter
ested arffl have to wait until after the new
colonel assumes command, which will
probably be within ten days.
The battalion located in the Ellis-street
armory will turn out to-night for battalion
drill.
Signal Corps, Second Brigade.
The members oi the Signal Corps, Sec
ond Brigade, have been busy of late
studying and tierfecting themselves in
the new coile recently introduced. The
young men find it much less complicated
than the old Morse system. Yesterday
| .squads were out on Presidio Heights and
'on Clarendon Heights practicing with
heliograph and (lacs.
There is tome talk of establishing two
practice stations, one on the top of Mount
Diablo and the other on the top of Mount
Tamalpais. and dsvote Sunday mornings,
when clear, to signaling between the two
points.
T ere is also some talk of bavins a
practice with searchlight signals, and it
is iikely that arrangements to that end
will be made in the near future.
The Cadets, Second Brigade
The cadet company of the Lowell High
School, attached to the First Regiment,
Second Brigade, returned from Camp
Duboce in Niles Canyon last Thursday
evening. It had been intended to march
in from the camp to Haywards, but the
rain had put the road in such a bad con
dition it was decided to abandon tie iaea,
and the young men returned to the City
after an absence of five days.
The time that the cadets were in camp
they were under the supervision of Lieu
tenant Harioe, and he found them manly
young fellows, sll willing to endure the
rough life in the desire to learn what they
could from actual experience as to mili
tary duties. He found them obedient to
orders, respectlul to their superiors and
all ready to do their share of guard duty.
He spoke in complimentary terms of Cap
tain L. E. Edwards, who was in command,
and of Lieutenant George M. Lipman.
Last Wednesday the cadets bad a sham
battle, in the conduct of which they used
about 450 blank cartridges. The event
having been announced in The Cali ( of
last Tuesday, there were present to witness
the event a number of persons from San
tf'r&ncisco, Oakland, Haywards, Alameda,
Niles, Pinole and other places, more than
IGO being on the grounds. Ten cadets
under command of Sergeant Evans
ascended the side of c hill on the north
of the camp and took up a position at a
point 200 feet above the level. The rest of
the company was divided into two pla
toons, one under command of Captain
E 1 wards ami the other under command of
Lieutenant Lipman. Those on the hill
side were on the defensive, while the
others were the attacking party, and the
object was to secure a red flag which floated
from the quarters of the "hiil ooys."
Captain Edwards and his cadets led the
attack, Â«nd ihey were supported br Lieu
tenant L pman and his force. As the at
tacking party advanced it was met by a
volley from above, and then there was a
reply from the attacking party. Then the
firing was brisk for a time. Th* cloud of
smoke that was raised served, together
with the underbrush, to conceal the ad
' vancine hill-climbers, and in a short time
! they were upon the enemy. In a moraÂ«nt
when Sergeant Evans* cidets were direct
ing their attntion. to Captain Edwards,
Lieutenant Lipman. "seeking reputation
at the cannon's mouth" â but in this case
the cannon was only a smooth-bore un
loaded rifle â rushed forward and snatched
the red flag and held it above his head, his
act being cheered by his cadets. Then
came a band-to-hand combat for the pos
session of ttie flag, and whiie this was
going on a squad commanded by Ser
geant Flinn. the young man recently ap
pointed a cidet to West Point, and an
other, commanded by Private Kelsey,
came to the rescue and drove back the
enemy in hue style, the flag remain ng in
the possession of the one who had cap
tured it. During the advance the captain
sent out flanking parties to cut off the
possible retreat of the enemy. In the
planning of this little battle Captain Ed
wards displayed considerable skill as a
strategist.
The engagement over the cadets were
cheered by the on-lookers and the com
bfltnnts returned to camp, where for some
time almost every individual was busy
with needle and thread working bomr
ward-bound stitches on garments that had
come in contact with barbed wire, and
then there was a great demand for soap,
to use in making bright again smoke
begrimed faces and hand*.
The visitors remained until dress pa
rade. at half- past 4 o'clock in the after
noon.
Three-quarters of an hour after the or
der to strike tents was given everything
was packed ready for transportation, ana
then the cadets were sped homewarJ,
highly pleased with the experience they
had had.
The young soldiers expressed them
selves hs extremely grateful to Lientenant-
Colonel Duboce for the interest he took in
thetu. to Lieutenant Harloe for the atten
tion he devoted to and the advice he gave
them in the management of tn Â» camp,
and to all who assisted in making the
camp the aurcess* it was. This may be
looked upon as quite an undertakine
when it is considered that the cadeis did
everything unaided, except by aJvice.
They secured the camp, procured the loan
of tents and furnished all that was neces
sary for the commissary departmentâ all
out of what they had trom the
small appropriation the StÂ»te allows them.
Troop A.
Troop A, Captain Jenks, is still at work
on the proposition to secure a number of
horses and a large place in the "Western
Addition to drLll. The prospects for se
curing twenty-five horses are of the best,
and now the troop expects that all the
hay dealersof the City will contribute bay
sufficient to feed the horses for a year. A
meeting of hay dealers to discuss that
proposition will be held shortly.

shooting tournament within the next two
months, open to all comer?. They hope
to obtain enougn money in this way to
defray their camping expenses in case the
Legislature fail to make an appropriation
for this purpose. The company are jubi
lant over ihe possession of the Gatlitig
eun which has been transferred to them
by the colonel from Company G, who has
long had charge of it.
Company E has eight men in their ranks
who have served in the regular army, and
with the pointers received irom them they
are rapidly coming to the front in drill
and in shooting abilities. Some time since
the members of the First had a tourna
ment with the Hawaiian Guards and beat
them. Company X never had any doubti
on tbe score of the F.rst winning, and
they are now anxious to :;o onto the range

GOOD INVESTMENT
The Pretty Town Well
Boomed by a Very
Small Outlay.
Too Big a Price Was Pa d to
Break Up a Political
Ring.
Ths Harbor May Bs Imprtvd If Z;a ;
Does Not Again Get the B tter
of Discretion.
Oakland Office San Frascisco Call,)
90S Broaaway, March 21. I
The people of Alameda Coanty never
â really understood the value of a "ioca cel
ebration" uniil last week, wlien they held
m flag-raising. They are now convinced
that a litile display of energy and local
pride is a good investment. To be very
bJunt, they realized' a return of over $1000
on aa expenditure of exaqtly $33 50. A
patriotic citizen donated flag and flag
pole for the public plaza. The Trustees
planned a celebration, and all the town
caught the spirit of the affair, ana a pub
lic holiday was declared. The exhibition
of enterprise was, of course, good news,
and all the papers devoted considerable
' space to San Leandro.
Au inquisitive genius has figured tip alt
the free advertising that the town ob
tained, and as near as can be ascertained
the space was worth over $1000. Flatter
ing and of necessity trutuiul notices of
the pleasant situation of the town and of
its many advantages were woven into the
published stories, and all the world knows
that there is a flourishi n e town in Ala
meda County named San _3eandro; that it
is connected with Oakland by a speedy
electr.c railroad; that it is a mode! place
to live in, and that the c.imate permits of
open-air celebrations in the warm sun-
Bhine of eariy March.
The following extract from the San Le
andro paper tells the rest:
, â¢ The conlmittee for the Hastings flag-raising

loilows: Music, $2t>; printiuu. $8 50; flags,

Thoughtful cii:zens and honest poli
ticians of Oakland now realize that a
great mistake was made when the charter
was arne-nded so as to make the City En
gineer and City Attorney ex officio mem
bers of the Board of Public Works. The
change was made in good faith, but tnnt
does not in any way qualify its failure.
At tho recent election it was the direct
cause of the defeat of a leading Republi
can candidate.
The change in the charter made two
years ago was undertaken for the pur
pose of breaking up an alleged ring at the
City Hall. It was evidently necessary
that some change be made, because the :
necessary two-thirds vote was given the i
measure by the voters. But. the price
pa.d was too dear, and the remedy is in
every respect as bad as the di-ease. In
stead of taking the main branch of toe
City government out of politics it has
forced the mexabers'of the- Board of Pub
lic Works to be politicians, even against
their will.
There is no practical sense in making
the City Attorney a dispenser of patron
age in the Fire Department, or in giving
the City Engineer the patronage of the
Polies Department. This, however, is the
present system, and it hampers both offi
cials, who should devote their time to
their respective duties without having to
be worried by an army of place-hunters,
â¢who are already clamoring lor - reward for
political service.
. In a city growing as fast as Oakland it
is an absurdity to make a change every
two years in the otlice of City Engineer. 1
Such pocedure must inure to the detri
ment of the city, because there are many
subordinate sewer systems and street
grades that need to be determined on
some common basis, but as things now
stand, no man is in office long enough to
carry out his ideas, and existing con
fusion becomes worse confounded every
two years. A Superintendent of Schools
appointed to nold office for four years,
and there is no reason why a City En
gineer should not be trusted in the same
, manner.
A. R. Wilson, the defeated Republican
' candidate, is acknowledged, by everybody
to be a competent, scientific e.iginter, but
be is tbe veriest tyro in polit.es, and as
.the fignt over the office is made witn the
main rye on the patronage end Wilson
was defeated. The same principle of
reasoning will .apply with equal aptness
to the office of City Attorney. With all
The pending litigation in which the city is
interested the City Attorney should not
be forced to make a political campaign
every two years, as at present.
There have now been two elections un
der the amended cnarter, but it is not
l:keiy that there will be a third. The next
Legislature willdoubless be asiced to pass
'upon another amendment.
The present dissatisfaction i 3 but an
â  other argument in favor of a consolidated
, a city-and county government.
** If tbe people of Oakland and Alameda
are wiso they will not medal any further
with" the progress of the harbor lmprove
* mentv. ~ The Question is now being asked
if it is better to let the Government
ext crts mind their own business than to
' >.ive the War Department details based on â 
prejudice rather than on practice. For '
.over a yar prominent official?, merchants I
and capitalists have been interfering with
tÂ«e Washington end of the harbor im
provement with the result that all work
was delayed for nearly, two years, and it is
: not yet certain that the appropriation will
ja-s the â¢ Senate. All the delay ar.d
anxiety have been caused because of the
complicated state of affairs that the War
lJepartraent has been advised exists in
Oakland and Alameda.
* Xt is all perfectly right and proper for
the dtizons to agitate for a public im-,
, provement, but when the improvement is
promised and money appropriated it is
time to stop. Government officials do not
tnice kindly to all kinds of fatherly ad
vice, especially when they 4iave expert*
on the spot whose duty it is to carry out
the improvements. Coionel Suter is wnil
acquainted with his worn, and when Ala
meda an 4 Oakland sent all kind* of con
trad.ctory and amateur reports to Wash
ing ton .t is not to be wondered at if he
advised that the whole matter lie over I
till t:ie p?opie cotne to their senses.
MÂ«n of, experience/such as have inter
ested themselves: in the harbor, should
know that beyond a certain, point con
flicting petitions fail tot enlighten. That
point was ' reached : reeatding : the : harbor
months ago, and if that fuct can i nly be
realized the harbor will stand a chance ot
â¢being completed -; within a reasonable
period. The War Department has recog
. nized the need of the improvement, fully
understands the situation and has clearly
intimated that. any furtherimportunities
â¢will be injurious. Â£tuabT;W.s Booth.

SEEKING HARMONY.
The University Class of '99 Preparing
to Obviate ifflculties in tho Pub
lication of l'heir Year Book.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 21. â The
difh'cu.ties which the last two or three
junior classes at th? State University
have met, botli as regards finances and the
publication of liquor "ads," have taught
the coming junior class a lesson. Hitherto
the condit ons surrounding the election of
officers have been so lax that when any
trouble h;is arisen there was no one who
could be held to account. The executive
committee of the class devi3ed a plan by
whicii they believe that no faction can
elect a candidate and thus control the
policy of the publication, but that through
it the best men will be chosen, expense
will be reduced, harmony will be assured
and responsibility can be traced.
Tne committpe has submitted the fol
lowing plan, which will be considered by
the class next Wednesday aliernoon :
Instead of choo'ng an editor-in-chief and
business manager, a board of editors, consist
ing of Seven members, shall be elected. This
board shall In turn elect from their own num
ber an t aitor-!n-chioÂ£ and business manager.
The board of editors shall assume the entire
financial responsibility of the publication. If
there be any .oss or any profit they shall share
it among themselves as tney agree.
The cinss shall guarantee to the board of
editors an assessment, to be raised as follows:
Each member of the class iball vny an assess
ment oi $2 50, or. if it is preferred, $3, which
shall entitle me payer to a Copy of tlie Blue
and Gold.
Briefly stated, the advantages of the pro
posed plan are these: First, there will be har
mony among the class iv support ot the book.
No one incuoncan elect us caadid&tes. tvvry
element wil. be represented and the book will
have undivided support. Socoud, the best
men will b- chosen editors. There will be a
larger number of candidates from which to
choose, and each man will have to run on his
own merit and special fitness. As a result the
best and most represeniauve men will be
e.ectcd. Third, tne book will be the best tliat
could possibiy by pr> duced. Each man will
feel an individual financial re-ponsibility ;
each man will have a loss to work again>t
and a profit iouotk ior, and each ma:i will
put forth his best efforts to make the book the
mos: successful ever published. Fourth, at
the same time the assessment will be grentiy
reduced ; on the one hand from $3 50 to $2 50;
on the other, if** B. aud G. is purchased, lrom
$3 50 to f 1 75.
A EAOETKACK PBAOAB.
One Horseman Plunges n Knife Into the
Head oT Hia Companion.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 21.â Dan God
frey and Charles Kobinson, two racetrack
followers, are in the County Jail. God
frey has the side of his face nearly cut off,
while Robinson is charged with doing tne
dee. l.
About 6:30 o'clock this morning Deputy
Constable D.-nny Cronin brought the two
to the Receiving Hospital so much the
worse for drink that neither was able to
walk straight. Neither was willing to
talk, but by degrees the story was told.
A party was playing pool in the new
saloon at the entrance of lUe racetrack
known Â»3 tbe Brutus. Godfrey was away
in the lead at 12 o'clock and wanted to
quit. Robinson was loser and wanted to
continue the game. A few words were
passed and Robinson is said to have
struck at Godfrey with a knife as sharp as
a razor ami a b.ade three inches in length.
On arriving at the hospital Steward
Tobin found Godfrey's right ear cut
through and a deep cut following the
lower jaw. He took fourteen or fifteen
stitches to close it ana both men were
taken to the jail.
Tobin says Robinson attempted several
times to escape from tbe hospiial while he
was dressing Godfrey's wounds. When
seen this afternoon in the jail Godfrey
said:
"I am unable to tell just how the affair
started or wnat happened, for we had
been playing pool all of the evening and
taken a quantity of drinks. I know that I
was badly cut. I do not know whether
the man arrested is the one who did it or
not. I nave not seen him to-day."

GAGGED AND TIED
WHILE IN BED
Daring Robbery of a
Woman by Black and
White Burglars.
Three Sleeping Children Not
Disturbed by the Desper
ate Visitors.
While the Ro b rs Ransacked
Mrs. Bost Was Bound Four Hours,
Her House.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 21. f
Mrs. Lucy Bost, a colored woman, was
found in her bed ihis morning with her
hanus and feet tied and her mouth
gagged. She had been roughly treated,
and was nearly dead with fright and ex
haustion wnen discovered by her children.
Last evening Mrs. Bost went to San
Francisco with some frit-nds. They re
turned early in the evening, and Mrs.
Bost got off the train at West Oakland and
visitei there. She came on to Broadway
late and met a gentleman friena named
Turner. He offered to escort her home,
and she accepted.
Turner and Mr 3. Bost went to her house,
which is at 616 Sixth street, and as they
approached they noticed a man leaving
the gate. He ran off before he could be
a-ked his business. Mrs. Bost asked
Turner to search the house, and he did so,
but nothing suspicious was found, and he
went away.
"I do not know how long I had been
asleep," said Mrs. Bost when telling her
story to-day, "but I t ink it was about 2
o'clock when I was awoke by a tap on the
shoulder. I awoke suddenly and could
see two men in tbe room. One of them
placed a handkeichief over my mouth and
tied it tightiy, and I could not utter a
sound. T ey then tied my hands and feet
and proceeded to rob the house.
"They found my purse and took from it
all the money amounting to sixteen dol
lars and a few little pieces of jewelry, and
then they searched the bureau, but evi
dently did not set anything they wanted,
for they took nothing but the money.
Whiie they were tying me they gave me
several slaps with their hands.
"My three children were asleep in the
hou-e, but they were not disturbed. After
satisfying themselves that there was
nothing else !e!t to take they wont off
leaving me bound and gagged."
Mrs. Bost says that one ot the men was
colored and the other white. She ha-*
furnished quite a complete description to
the police and a good clew is being fol
lowed that will probabiy result iv the
capture of the black man.
SAYS IT IS FALSE.
Kichard Iloni, Berkeley'! Marshal, De-
Clares That O'Xelll's Affidavit
la a Lie.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 21.â Richard
Lloy â ', Berkeley's Marshal, denies in toto
tbe charges of malfeasance in office pre
ferred against him by Hugh O'Neill of the
West End, as told in ihts morning's Call.
He said to-day that the affidavit from the
hand of O'Neill charging him with per
mitting certain liquor-houses to remain
open after midnight contrary to law and
of himself drinking a ter midnight with
the allege l violators is a lie from begin

"The whole thing was concocted," said
Lloyd, ''with a v ew to having me turned
down in the coming election. Ii is simply
a campaign lie.
"The word of O'Neill ia not worth the

SANKEY SANG OF SUNLIGHT.
The EvangelUt Spoke and Introduced
Some New Hymns at the V M. C. -A.
Ira D. Sankey of Moody and Sankey,
evangelist and hymn writer, spoke and
sang yesterday afternoon before an audi
ence that more than filled the Y. M. C. A.
Auditorium.
He sat much of the time at a little
organ at the front of the platform. Part
of the overflow audience, occupying extra
chairs, was crowded close behind him. In
a Icud but rather husky bass voice, im
possible of finer modulations, he leit the
singing, afier instructing his hearers in
the music and words of several hymns
new to this coast. Among them was one
just from the pen of Fanny Crosby, the
aged blind Hymn composer of Brooklyn,
who has not seen the light of day for
seventy years.
It wassomething about "Lst the blessed
sunlight enter," and Mr. Sankey with a
readiness for dramatic effeci paused ap
propriately and had the western shades
raised, letting broad bands of dazzling
-unlight into a previously and pernaps
purposely darkened room. Later, in tell
in.- thestorv of the conversion from drunk
enness fitteen years ago in his presence of
tin- man who M to-day one of the beat
known Presbyterian ministers in the State
of Illinois â the Rev. VV. O. Latimerâ he
insured the desired effect upon iiuudro.ls
of bis auditors by removing his glasses
ati'i applying bis hamikercbief to his eyes.
ThÃ speaker struck a responsive chord
in that assemblage as he has in thousands
of others during the twenty-six years that
be and Mr. Moody have traveled and
spoken in tbe cause of Christ.
He hopes during his present and last
visit to California to learn of the place
whereMaryl.ee Demorest, hymn-wrier,
is buried, that he may visit that grave
yard and rea i the inscription on the head
stone.
During bis remarks Mr. Sankey said:
Persons like to-day to raise the question, Is
the word of the Bible to be trusted? The min
isters ot the G- spei are sent to preach God's
word, not to question its truih. There are a
great many things that we don't know, but
there are things that we do know, and let us
dwell upon those things.
Your conscience knows that the word of God
In he Book of Genesis is true. It is only your
own stubbornness that prevents your acknowl
edging it.
How can a youne man be cleansed of his
sins? The Bible says, By taking heed of God's
word.
Referring to the recent controversy over
the effects of cony r-ion Mr. Sankey said
that he had not read anything that had
appeared in. the papers, but that he wished
to introduce a letter lately received from a
young man who had experienced imme
diate conversion in this City. In part the
letter he read was as follows:
When you and Mr. Moody were In San Fran
cisco in '79 or '80 I was a young man in the
City of San Francisco leading a wicked life.
I had twenty-live young men companions and
before I left there fourteen of them
were in their graves. the result of,
riotous and immoral living late at night.
One nlfrht, geiting up from the gam
cling table, 1 passed along the sidevralk
in iront of the Congregational Church, and
while just opposite the door I heard from the
preacher within the one word, "Stop!" It im
pressed meai that time and I turned and en
tered and took a back seat, a dissipated,
wrecked young man. I went from thatcnurch
without speaking to a goul, but I was a
changed Ban, and now I am a preacher of the
gospel. I just mention this to show ihat tbere
is such a tiling as immediate conversion.
Mr. Sankey will speak in the Y. M. C. A.
auditorium again this evening, and to
morrow evening he will be the principal
attraction at a "students' night" to be
held at the same place, and for the pur
pose of gathering; together and entertain
ing all college or school students in this
City. He will be in this part of the State
several weeks and will then visit Southern
California.
REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
No Sales of Any Great Im
portance Reported Dur
ing the Week.
Building Still Continues Active,
Especially in tbe Sub
urban Districts.
The Torrens Land Bill Has Become
a Law, and Will Take Effect in
a Few Months-
While largo sales and transfers of property
are not particularly lively at the momeat, still
It is gratilying to note that there are enough
sales of lesser magnitude being made to keep
matters going and that building operations
are quite lively.
Tnere is no delay in work on the larger
buildings now in course of construction, and
tlieie, with the new contracts now teing en
tered into daily, mean employment for the
skilled mechanic and the laborer and ihe
placing of money where it is most needed.
It looks as if San Francisco would before
long become as noted as Philadelphia as a city
of homes. As The Call has frequently re
marked, nothing conducts more to the stabil
ity and prosperity of a ciiy than the owner
ship of homes by a majority of the citizens,
anarchists and rioters and boycotters are
seldom found among the class of home-own
ersâamong those who have some stake In tbe
community, who have something to lose. It
is the other fellows, who own nothing, that re
semble Artemus Ward, who was willing to
sacrifice all his wife's relatives on the altar of
hiscouutry. For this, among other reasons,
the man who makes it easy for his fellow citi
zens of small means to acquire homes of their
own is a public benefactor and should be en
couraged.
It is noted that there are a good many more
houses offered for rent than tiiero have been
for a number of months past. On the face oi
it this looks as if the building business had
been somewhat overdone, but such does not
seem to be the case, as the demand for desira
ble nouses keeps up very well, m spite Of ihe
fact that the summer is close upon us. The
truth is, as any one can ascertain who takes
the troub.e to investigate, that a good many of
those hou*es which, are offered for rent are not
â what may be termed first-class. Either on ac
count of iheir location or because they are old
fashioned and do not contain what are known
as "modern Improvements" they do not come
Under the category of thoroughly desirable
modern residences.

COULDN'T FIND THE PEA.
How a San Francisco r port Was
Swindled at Carson by
a Faker.
There is one man â and a well-known
one â of this City who will fight shy of the
suave and bland sure-thing gambler the
next time he attends a prizefight, and
will run as the deer when a pea-and-shell
game heaves in sight.
George F. Ehrenpfort of Kothchild <fc
Ehrenpfort, the candy manufacturers, is a
good sport, and he never misses a fight
that is worth seeing. So it was that he
journeyed to Carson with a portly
wallet and many anticipations of a royal
battle between the aspirants for the fistic
championship.
He did not contemplate an encounter
with the tiger himself, but lie had one,
and his friends are making merry at his
expense. Ehrenpfort landed in Carson
the day before the fight, and, after engag
ing quarters at many good hard dollars
per hour, started out to see the sights.
He had not gone far before the festive pea
and-shell faker met bis eye. and the meet
ing was fateful for Ehrenpfort.
He bud never seen the game because its
day had waned in San Francisco before
the candyman's appetite lor pugilism
awoke, and he tarried to witness the
play.
A man who looked as though he hailed
from Pumpkinville, but who, of course,
was the "capper," bet the faker $20 that
the pea was under a certain shell. It goes
without saying that he lost.
Ehronpfort was sure that he had seen
where the elusive vegetable had gone and
quickly placing his hand over another
shell to make certain that the pea was not
opirited away, he dug up a double eagle
und wagered the gambler that he was
rieht. Of course the pea was not there,
but Ehrenpfort was sure he could "guesÂ»
aeain" and bet $50 the next throw.
This followed the first contribution to
the laker's "roll," but the sport's bood
was up and he did not stop bunting that
pea at $50 a hunt uatil he was cleaned out
and $400 had been transferred to the
gambler's pocket.
Tnen Ehrenpfort was sorry, but it did
not help him any, for while he was con
sidering whether to thra9h the faker or
call the police the man who stole his
money emulated the ArnDand stole away.
Luckily Ehrenpfort's commercial rating
was well known to a large number of those
in the prize-tight town, and he was easily
able to raise enough funds to get home, a
sadder and wiser man.
And it is said that "there were others."

The California Labor Convention De

ani Adjourns.
The California Labor Convention held
its final meeting yesterday afternoon at

The nrincipal business before the con

urged. The discussion of this matter
brought forth much earnest debate.
The subject was brought before the
body by tne report of the committee on
laws and legislation. This report, which
was sicned by three of the eleven mem
bers of the committee, was a resume of
tiie work accomplished by the convention
in securing the passage of labor laws. It
contained a statement denouncing the
failure of a number. of the bills to pass as
being due to ignorance, incompetence,
carelessness and indifference to the neces
sities of labor.
Some of the members of the convention
did not consider those charges sufficiently
specific, and a spirited debate ensued.
Chnirman Rose, who had been in at
tendance at a portion of the legislative
session, had a report which he presented
to the convention. It traced the successive
steps of the various labor bills in the.r
progress to success or failure. Incident
ally he repeated remarks which the legis
lators had been said to have made con
cerning the bills, and ascribed motives to
their opposition to them. Both reports
were then referred to a committee consist
ing oi W. McArthur, James Rose, J. Hill,
H. Please and C. F. Buckley, who will re
port to the various unions.
P. H. SicCarthy, who had been ap
pointed to see Mayor Phelan and Labor
Commissioner Fitzgerald in reeard to the
wage rate of the cen- riciari-s of the Un
employed Committee's funds, reported
that Mayor Phelan declared he had noth
ine to do wi'h fixing the rate, and did not
favor the $1 rate. The Labor Commis
sioner had written to the chairman of the
Unemployed Committee urging that 20 or
25 cents an hour be paid.
A resolution was introduced by C. E.
Hawkes calling upon Senator Perkins,
Secretary of War Alger and Major Frank
McLauÂ»hlin to protest against the appoint
ment of H. G Otis of Los Angeles to any
public office, as he had proved himself an
enemy to labor, and his appointment
would be considered stultifying the prom
ises of the Republican party.
A resolution introduced by George
Lafayette, severely denouncing "Assembly
bill No. 285, which refers to the tramp bill
providing for the compulsory labor of
vagrants upon public roads, and calling
for a committee of three to wait upon
Governor Budd and request him to reject
such bill, was passed. George Lafayette,
James Rose and C. E. Hawkes were ap
pointed such committee.
Resolutions of thanks were vote! to the
Labor Bureau for the use of the hall and
to the secretary for efficient services After
a long debate it was decided to adjoUrn
sine die.

SOME BLOOD IN
McKINLEY'S EYE
Dr. Jordan Thinks Pelagic
Sealing Will Soon
Be Stopped.
Just Returned From Washing
ton After Explaining
the Situation.
Young Female Seals Will Be Branded
So That Their Skins Will Bs
Unmarketable.
"I talked over the sealing question with
most of the influential men of the present
administration. I also .ad quite a talk
with President McKinley upon the neces
sity of putting a stop to pelagic sealing,
and before I finished an explanation of
the sad condition of affairs in Bering Sea
I thought I saw blood in McKinley'a
eye."
So spake Dr. David Starr Jordan yester
day. He had just returned to this City
from a second official visit to Washington
on business connected with last summer's
Bering Sea Commission, of which he was
the head, during its thorough investiga
tion of the causes of the alarming decrease
in valuable fur-bearing animals.
In connection with the subject he said:
Steps are being taken by the new adminis
tration looking toward a final settlement of
the fur-seal question on tue basis of the inves
tigation oi mo past summer. Great Britain
sent to tbe fur seal islands a commission of
her own, which in connection with the Amer
ican commission has thoroughly investigated
the condition of the seal herd. This commis
sion agreed in all matters of fact with the rind
ing* of the American commission. Its report,
however, has not yet been published.
The only possible settlement of the fur-seal
question lies in the total prohibition of pelagic
sealing. Great Britain will therefore doubt-
Jess be asked to unite with the United States
in some equitable arrangement whereby kill
ing of females at sea can be done away with.
It is believed that Great Britain will not re
fuse to unite with us in taking steps to pre
serve the fur seals. However, in case she
should refuse te make any fair arrangement
tne United States will be prepared to take the
mac 1 ' rin her own hands and protect her own
interests by aprgressive measures. Steps will
immediately be taken to brand the female
seals in such a wav as to destroy tne value of
their skins, and also to protect the males by
herding them in the salt lagoon on St. Paul
Island during the sealing season. Practical
experiments made last summer have demon
strated the feasibility of these two measures,
and their effect will 'be to put an end to the
business of pelagic sealing. Thisbusinesshas
already, in fact put an end to itself, for the
reduced catch of last summer failed to pay
expenses, aud the catch of 1897, it sealing be
peTmiued, wiil be made at greater loss.
It is possible also for the United States, by
co-operation witu those interested in the
maintenance of tbe seal herd and tbe indus
tries arising from it, to bring about the finan
cial collapse of the business of handling pe
lagic sealskins. IX this becomes necessary it
will be pursued.
It is the intention of the present adminis
tration to briug to a speedy end the present
diminishing condition of the herd, which is a
disgrace a iice to Great Britain and America.
Pelagic sealing must go and the fur-seal
herd will be preserved. The silly proposition
to destroy the fur-seal h^rd ourselves, before
making any serious attempt to save it, hÂ«s
been effectually disposed of, and will not
again be iiuara of.
Dr. Jordan remarked that Nevada had
disgraced herselfâ has made a final de
spairing but unsuccessful effort to recu
perate from financial ruin, and that now
he would like to see her annexed to Califor
nia or to Utah, but that be supposes Cali
fornia does not want her.
Dr. Jordan, accompanied by George A.
Cook, secretary of the sealing commission
and secretary also of Stanford University,
left here last evening for Palo Alto, ac
dompanied by Mrs. Jordan, who came up
to meet her husband.
SCULLING FOR A TROPHY
Preliminary Contests of the Pi
onesr Rowing Cub Yes
terday.
A Big Crowd Saw the Struggle Off
Long Wharfâ Fin U Comes Off
N'Xt Surd y.
Four four-oared barge crews of the Pio
neer Rowing Club competed yesterday in
the contest for the McKinley trophy, a
handsome cap valued at $150, ihat waÃ
won by the club last year.
Two preliminary heats were rowed off,
leaving: the final to be decided. The start
ing pom; was in front of the clubhouse,
on Long Wharf, thence to a stalceboat an
chored off the Rolling mills, and return,
a distance of a mile and a half. In the
first lieat the following crew won:
' R. Crowley, strolce; G. Callopy, after
waist; JT. O'NeiJ, forward waist ;R. Cal
lopy. bow; T. Sands, coxswain.
The losing crew was composed of F.Orr,
stroke; J. Chinda, after waist; G. Darrah,
forward waist; J. Connolly, bow, and R.
coxswain.
The time was 11 minutes and 40 sec
onds, the oarsmen being considerably
hampered on the home run by a strong
wind and tirle.
In the second heat the winning crew
was made up of C. Ochs stroke, M. Cal
nan after-waist, T. Faulkner forward
waist, T. Sand 3 bow and G. Fitzsimmons
coxswain. The losers were: R. Ejpey
stroke, P. Tuite, after-waist, W. Espey
forward- waist, G. Darrah bow and T. Orr
coxswain. The time was 10 minutes flat,
which is rather fast, considering the con
dition of the water.
Fully six hundred people witnessed the
contests, which were exciting in the ex
treme, the nr-t heat being won by three
lengths ami the second by one length.
The deciding heat between the winners
of yesterday's contests will be rowed off
next Sunday at 11 o'clock, and a great race
Is expected.
The Pioneera are having their eight
oared bane Grizzly, which bai figured in
co many races, overhauled preparatory to
the coming rowing seaÂ«on.
A Musical Treat.
There has been no end to the favorable
comments in musical circles about the ar
tistic performance upon the violin of Miss
Belle Rosenthal, accompanied by her sis
â¢ tÂ«r Flora, on the piano, at the Trebelli
concert Saturday afternoon. Her inter
.pretation of the rirst part of the seventh
concerto de Berioz and mazourka, by
Wieniawsky, displayed the greatest ma
gical talent ana me most finished culture.
Sbe plays with great volume and force
and at the same time with a sweet expres
sion, and her technique is faultless.
GloTADiÃken' Picnic.
The second annual picnic of the gloTcmakers
â¢was held at Shell Mound Park yesterday, and
the plenure-seeters bad an enjoyable time.
The officers of thlÂ» body are: J. Doyle, presi

IS LA DIVA
JEALOUS OF HER?
Prima Donnas of the French
Opera Company Dis
agree.
Aimee Pascal the Biauty of the
Troup Wants a Chance
to" Sing.
Foedor Says She Is Hsr Understudy
and That She Cannot be 111 to
Oblige Her.
There is trouble behind the scenes ard
everything is not moving as evenly as it
should in the ranks of the French opera
company.
Two of the prima donnas, Mme. FcÃdor
and Mile. Aimee Pascal, scarcely speak as
they pass by. They say "Bon jour,"
MLLE. AIMEE PASCAL, Who Wants to Sing in La Diva
Foedor*s Roles*
"Bon soir," as they crowd one another in
the wings, but on the street they do not
recognize one another.
It is the same time-honored story â a
talented woman jealous of a younger and
a prettier one; that is, according to the
version of the favored one. Mile. Airuee
Pascal has seen but one brief season on
the lyric stage, but in that short period
has made for herself & reputation as a
beauty, and a talented beauty at that. She
made her debut at L'Opera Comique,
in Paris, creating a role in Caaen's oper
etta. "Femme de Cland."
The role was not a startling oue and
Pascal owed much of her fame to the
beautiful Reutiinger photos of her fair
self that adorned all the shop windows in
Paris. Her ambitious desires to accom
plish more than the limited roles of the
Cumique afforded led to her coming to
America with Impresario Charley. Cnar
ley, according to MisÂ« Pascal, held her
hand, called her "Mon enfant"â an ac
tion and expression that Foedor also
accredits him with â and promiseJ her slio
was to create "La Navarraise" iv America.
Accordingly Pascai sought the aid of
Massaretand perfected herself in this role,
in which she expects to achieve her first
great triumph.
But she ran up against a snae, none
other than Mrne. Focdor, priraa donna as
soluta of the company. Fo?dor was jeal
ous of the dark-eyed beauty, and by those
devious but absolute means ladies of her
exalted station employ secured for herself
the much-coveted role.
La Belle Pascal tells all this in a touch
lngly plaintive manner. Her big brown
eyes narrow and soften, the corners of her
mouth droop and her voice is that of some
poor martyred saint. "She it ferociously
jealous," she says, "and I can do nothing.
My contract calls for nine performances a
month, extra ones to command a salary
In excess, but management reserves the
right to have me idle all the time if it so
desires.
"Fcedor has a bold on him and she won't
lit him Rive me a chance." With the best
nature in the world sbe pays Ler compli
ments to the older singer. "She sings
well â very well. Why, then, is she alraid
of me? I hnve only one year's experience.
She many, many more. What can sue
have to fear?
"Why, she carries her jealousy so very
far, to such an extent that when the

spects to me, asked her where I waa stop

pins so that he might call, she declared
she^lid not know and furthermore ad
visfl him not to.
"The Consul was highly indignant. He
has his opnions of Mme. Fcsdor. "
But wnat Mile. Pascal wants most of all
is a chance to sing. "I want to sing,"
says the beauty. "I want to sing 'La
Navarraise.' I have the power, the dra
matic tire, and I long to sing it."
Mine. Fcedor does not accept the story
of a jealous woman's undoing of a pretty
woman with quiet grace. Madame, who
also claims ali the fire and soul necessary
for "La Xavarraise, " becomes excited when
Pascal's name is mentioned.
"I jealous of her!" she exclaims. "C'est
trop lort. I won'tallow her tosinc! Why,
she is simply my understudy, and really I
cannot fall sick simply to oblige her."
"These rumors of jealously," went on
the roadame, "she started them. She did
the same thing in New Orleans. There
tbey became so annoying that I pretended
to be ill one night, just to let her sing and
let the people judge for themselves what
she could do. And the result? Why, ihe
subscribers clamored at the box office to
have their money refunded.
"She can't sine, at least not now. What
she will be able to do when she has
acquired experience, time alone can tell.
She is anxious to appear, that is all there
is to it, and as to singing my part, she
would be just as pleased to sing the
barytone's."
The squabble between the prima donnas
is not the only unpleasantness the man
ngfiment has had to contend with. Tenor
I'revost has had his inning. Just before
the company left New Orleans for this
City Prevost demanded higher salary.
His demand being granted he took ad
vantaee of a generous management to do
mand still more. Tim request meeting
with a firm and decided refusal, Trevost
sent in his resignation, and the company
came on without him, having to open in
"L" Africaine." with Masart, instead of
"Trovatore," as first announced.
Reflection, however, brought better
counsel to Prevost. He wired hi* mana
ger that he accepted the old terms and
came on a<* fast as steam could carry him.
The main uuestion at issue, though, is
not the tenors, bui the prima tionnÃS.

FITZSIMMONS
AT THE CHUTES
The New Pugilistic Cham
pion Was Coldly
Received.
The Fistic Events Arranged by
the National and Pacific
Clubs.
Parson Davies' Novel Sweepstake for
Fighters, in Which Hs Will
Maka Two Entries.
The first appearance of Champion Bob
Fitzsimmons since his defeat of James J.
Corbett was not such a pronounced or
howling success yesterday at the Chutes.
Somehow the crowd â for there was a
crond, although not nearly so large as
wnen Corbett showed there two months
agoâ was cold and frosty.
Fitzsimmons, ltd by Press Agent Hast
ings, helped to earn his salary by taking
in all the sideshows. Following in his
wake hundreds of boys, men and women
w ould pay their way to be in attendance
at the same time as the champion.
Late in the afternoon Fitzsimmons
â bowed how clever he is at punching the
bap, and subsequently he had tnree rather
tame rounds at boxing with Sicl/.ner, his
trainer. At night Hickey, another trainer,
was his sparring partner.
At neither of the performances was
there any enthusiasm or demonstration.
Tne crowd was composed mostly of the
class of people that backed Corbett, and
the star of tbe day did not strike them as
a favorite. The rather unusual rate for
tne Chutes of 50 cents per capita kept the
working clas* away, ami it is among the
toilers that Fitz can count his friends.
Hence the new champion's reception was
not as warm as he expected.
Mrs. Fitzsimmons attracted almost as
much attention as did her husband.
Martin Julian, her brother, was present
also with an eye on the box receipts.
The bright era of pugilism which seems
to be opening will be ushered in on tbe
21 of next month by the National Ath
letic Club. Jeffries and Van Â±susltirk will
spar lifteen rounds. The club is also try
ing to match Homer McCoy, a brother of
Kid McCoy, against Slater, who fought
Billy Gallagher of Los Angeles some
weeks ago.
The Pacific Athletic Club has matched
Stelzner against Alex Greggains for a 15
--round go on April 12. Agnew and
Thompson will also meet in a 20-round
contest. The club is trying to match
Jimmy Barry and Jimmy Anthony, the
bantams, for the world's cnampionship.
The Olympic Club will not make any
matches until it hears from Tommy Ryan
of Syracuse, N. Y. Secretary Kennedy
telegraphed him an offer of a $3000 purse,
$2500 ior the winner and $500 for the loser,
lor a contest with George Green.
Bob Arru-trong, the colored giant, and
Jimmy Barry, the two proteges of Parson
Davies, are in this City. Davies hasoffered
to back Joe Choynski against Tom Sharkey
for $2500 or any part oi it, and he will back
Armstrong against any man*.
His most novel proposition is to enter
two men in a sweepstake, ihe entrance fee
being $2500. As many men mar enter as
choose to do so, and each man will be
made to fight the others. It will then be
a case of the survival of the fittest.

KNOCKED OUT
IN ONE ROUND
" Mysterious " Billy Smith
Meets His Water
loo.
He Was Looking for Trouble
and Young Mitchell Ac*
commodated Him.
During the Brief Engagement Young
Mitchell's Little F.nzer Was
Nearly Bitten Off
"Mysterious" Billy Smith feels sore
over bis defeat by George Green at Carson
last Wednesday, and since then he has
been vowing vengeance against Green and
bis friends.
John L. Herget, better known as "Yoang
Mitchell," who keeps a saloon on Taylor
street and Golden Gate avenue, is one of
Green's stanchest friends, and Smith hns
on more than one occasion had trouble
with him.
Smith got on a "jag" yesterday morn
ing, and about noon he made his way to
Herget's saloon, telling everybody that he
was going to knock Herget's head off.
Some friends got hold of him and forced
him to accompany them to his brother's
house. 316 Golden Gate avenue. They un
dressed him and put him to bed, think
ing that alter a sound sleep his blood
thirsty designs would leave him.
As soon as they left Smith got out of
bed, dressed himself and slipped out of
the rear and got onto Turk street. He
hurried along Turk, turned into Jones
street and Golden Gate avenue, reaching
Herget's saloon.
He burst into the saloon, which was
crowded with men, and before any one
divined his intention he jumped at Her
get, making a vicious blow at bis jaw.
Herget ducked and sent Smith to tbe floor
with a swift right-hander on the chin.
Smith lay on the floor and Herget lifted
him up with both hands.
"Stand up and fight like a man, jou
cur!" said Herget, whose blood was up.
Smith managed to get the little huger
of Herget's right hand in his mouth and
chewed it to ihebone. Herget bore the
pain without flinching and grasped Smith
by the throat with his left hand.
Smith hung on to Herget's finger like a
bulldog, and did not let go till he was al
most black in the face. Herget's arm
dropped to his side, and for the first time
the crowd realized what Smith had done.
There was a howl of rage, and Smith
wisely rushed oat of the saloon and dis
appeared.
Herget went to a physician and had his
wounde-l hncer dressed. The pain was
excessive, but lie never winced.
It is not long since that Smith and Billy
Gallager had a rough-and-tumble light in
Herget's saloon, and both used their teeth
as much as their hands.
A few nights before they faced each
other in the Mechanics' Pavilion, but
owing to the foul tactics of both fighters,
particularly Smith, the referee after a
round or two ordered them out of the ring.
CON IS RID OF HIS CAT.
Mooney's Beast Was Killed in
a Battle With a Bull
dog.
The Fight Was Fulled Off Daring tbe
Fistic Carnival Last Weik ut
Carson City.
Con Mooney's wild cat is dead. V vl-./
This is the cat that Mooney was said to
have tried to match against a bulldog
thiee months ago at the Seven-mile House.
Officers Holbrook and Hooper of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals interfered, however, and arrested
Mooney and his cat as they were on their
way to the proposed scene of battle.
In the â¢ Police Court Mooney â  beat â¢ tho
case, bringing up enough ; evidence and
testimony to bolster up his own statement
that furthest from his mind and kind
heart would be tne thought of such cruel
sport as mixing up a aog and a cat in a
right to the death.
Having won his case, Mooney again
to#k possession of the wildcat, and last
week he shipped it to Carson, Nev. \
On the night prior to the Fitzsimmons-
Corbett fight Mooney got Pat Dunn of
Lake Tahoe to furnish a ';â¢ 20-pound bull
dog, and the tip was ;r passed around
among the sports that there was going to
ba a tight. â - :
A couple of . hundred sports . paid an ag
gregate of $500 for admission to the barn,
where the cat's cage was opened and the
dog tossed in. '''â ''-'.â¢ : . ;. â ;
- The fight was not of long duration. Fur
began to fly immediately, and the wild
cat i jumped out of the cage, the dog after
him. ..:'.,. Â : â â : " â â¢â - ".-â  â â¢â¢ v :-â¢"',â '.; ';' ."â 
There was a general stampede of sports,
while the cat and dogâ the latter a close
secondâ raced in, out and ' around the
bales of hay.
Tne dog finally caught the cat by the
neck and was slowly chewing: it to
death, hidden where no one could wit
ness the death struggle. ' V â¢" ;
Pat Dunn filially, grabbed both beasts,
and, as the unfortunate cat was in the
last throes of death, he v pitched them
where those who had paid to witness the
alleged. sport could see a little something
for their money.
The : dog escaped with but a very few
scratches. â¢%â ;-. ,. ; : . â â  -j^'-J- 'â . .â â â ."'
