Active Preparations at Athens for
a Possible Renewal of
the War.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, May 26.â
The Council of Ministers to-day dis
cussed at length the collective note of
the powers. It was decided to prolong the
armistice indefinitely. The Ministers re
fused to even discuss the abandonment of
Thessaly, but agreed to leave the other
points involved to the arbitration of the
powers.
Khalil-Rifaat Pasha, the Grand Vizier,
presented a statement to the Sultan on
Saturday last declaring that the successes
of the Turkish army had revived the ardor
of the nation, which, thereby reunited,
would surround the throne in an invinci
ble phalanx. The Grand Vizier urged the
Sultan to regard the powers as enemies
who were plotting to destroy Turkey, ana
said:
"If we yield to European pressure we
shall alienate Mussulmans. Therefore, I
implore your Majesty for t';e sake of your
victorious ancestors to retain Thessaly."
Tne Grand Vizier then recalled questions
of the past, including the Armenian mat
ter, regarding which the Sultan refused to
be dictated to, with the result that he
gained the victory. He urged that his j
Majesty be guided by those examples |
now, and said that if his advice was unpal- j
atable he begged to resign.
The text of the note presented to the
Porte yesterday by representatives of the
powers has not yet been made oublic, but
it is known that it expresses the gratifica
tion of the European governments at the
suspension of hostilities, and also
recognizes the right of Turkey to
a rectification of the frontier and to de
mand the payment of a war indemnity
by Greece in proportion to the resources
of that country.
The note concludes by informing the
Â±'orte that the foreign diplomats are pre
pared to discuss terms of peace with the

Volunteer de Felice of Italy Forced to
Xcai'*' : Greece.
ATHENS. Greece, May 26.â The noto
rious socialist, Giuseppe de Felice, a mem
ber of the Italian Chamber of Deputies,
who volunteered with the Greek army,
casually met Premier Ralli at the Min
istry ot Marine to-day and vehemently
abused him for the treatment accorded to
Italian volunteers. Ralii summoned a
po'iceman and ordered him to convey De
Felice on board the Italian warship, with
the request that tie never be allowed to
again enter Greet territory.
The* Garibaldi brothers, Riciotti and
Giuseppe, who also served with the Greek
troops, tried to rescue De Felice when he
was being conveyed to a railway station
en route to Pirscus. They were aided by a
number of others. A sharp fight resulted,
in which some of the participants were in
jured. De Felice was placed on t c war
ship Sardegna, but was released as soon
as he arrived on board, owing to the in
tervention of the Italian Minister. He
promises to leave Greece peaceably forth

Greek Government Preparing for a Pos
sible Clash. '-..-[
LONDON, Eve., May 26.â The Standard,
alluding to the refusal of the Porte to
abandon Thessaly, says that, whether the
Sultan is bluffing or is the victim of
popular pressure, peace such as Europe
expects cannot be reached without the
gravest complications.
The Athens dispatch to the Times says:
"It is believed complications have arisen
owing to the advocacy by some of the
powers, including Russia, of Turkish oc
cupation of Thessaly until the indemnity
J is paid, and to England's firm resistance
to such a project. The Greek Govern
ment are preparing for a possible renewal
of war."
A dispatch to the Times from Larissa
! says the impression is general among the
| Turkish troops that there will be mote
j fighting. A brigade has started for
jP. ourka, armed with Mausers. Another
dispatch says the Turkish Government
has mobilized 50,000 additional troops,
! who are now in readiness to advance into

He was arrested and a loaded revolver
and a dagger were found upon him.

SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, MAY 27, 1897.
ALMOST
FREE, BUT
DETECTED
Convict McCarthy Saws
Through the Bars of
His Cell.
BETRAYED BY A SLIGHT
NOISE.
His Scheme Frustrated on the
. Eve of His Intended
Departure.
THEN THE TUNNELER MAKES
A CONFESSION.
Graphic Story of the Attempt
to Rob a Los Angeles
National Bank.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 26.â J.
McCarthy, one of the gang that tunneled
under the First National Bank and came
so near securing the treasure in the vault,
has again displayed his skill as a me
chanic. Since < his conviction on the
charge of attempted robbery and sen
tence to ten years in the peni
tentiary McCarthy has been confined in
the County Jail here awaiting the out
come of his appeal to .the Supreme Court.
His cell was in the United States tank at
the ton of tbe jail. He came very near
succeeding in an "attempt to change his
quarters. That he was discovered before
he escaped from jail is due to the sharp
hearing of the turnkey.
Late Tuesday night Turnkey Harring
ton heard some unusual noises proceeding'
from that portion of the jail where Mc-
Carthy was confined, but every time he
went upstairs to investigate the sounds
ceased. > When finally the officer's
suspicions were thoroughly aroused,
he made an investigation, resulting
in the ducoveiy that the prisoner/had
sawed out a portion of the grating at the
top of his cell.' Eight bars had been cut
through, making an opening twelve inches
square. The detached portion was held
in place by a string tied to a piece of stick
three feet long, which rested on top of the
grating. y-JJ. ,;â¢ â  ?â  .*-.â¢* -yyr
An investigation by Jailer Kennedy de
veloped some most astounding things.
McCarthy nad not only passed through
the top of his cell, but he had penetrated
the ceiling of tbe jail proper, having covered
the hole with a square of white paper.
The jailer passed through this hole into
the attic, where he found a pleated rope,
forty feet long, made of a jail blanket.
The jailer followed the trail beneath the
roof to the west wall of the jail, where
the prisoner had remover a tier of brick,
leaving only one tier between him and
liberty, and this frail barrier he could
have put his foot through when he
FRANK McCOPPIN, THE DEAD POSTMASTER/
pleased.* As he afterward admitted it was
his intention to escape to-night by means
of the openings he had made, and bat for
the opportune discovery his plan would
have succeeded. Jr.J, j AiyJJ
When the jail officials had success
fully headed off all of McCarthy's plans
for escape, they set about to find the tools
he had used. In a cuspidor they found
fragments of a broken star saw that had
been brought to the prisoner by some con
federate visitor.
In the attic was found, beside the coil
of rope, a one-inch wood chisel that had
come from somewhere outside, and a
jimmy that had been improvised from a
piece of bar-iron wrenched from the jail
wall. No one knows who supplied the
tools, but they were used only as a skilled
' mechanic could use them.
McCarthy claims to have served appren
ticeships first as a navigator with his
! father, then as a plumber and later as an
J engine-fitter, and that he has learned
! much by experience is shown by his crim
\ inal acts. -;\-.V;'
Since last Saturday, when the Supreme
Court affirmed the verdict of the Superior
Court sentencing him to ten years in the
penitentiary, McCarthy has been such a
different man as to excite the suspicion of
his guardians.
When he found, as he expressed it, that
"the jig was up,"' McCarthy -became com
mnnicative and expressed a willingness to
tell all he knew, not only about his at
tempt :to â¢ break jail, but about the at
tempt to rob the First National Bank.
* To Jailer Kennedy and a reporter Mc-
Carthy related the particulars of the dar
ing, attempt to rob the Fir-it National
Bank about a year ago by excavating a
tunnel from a Commercial-street saloon
cellar to tbe lower vault of the bank, a
distance of 190 feet.
The conspirators had spent about two
and a half months' tune in digging this
tunnel, which terminated in a lower vault
of the bank, where no valuables were kept,

Fares Reduced.
Postmaster Frank McCoppin died yes
terday morning at the Mount Zion Hospi
tal, .' corner of Sutter and Hyde streets,
from the effects of a surgical operation
for cancer of the stomach and intestines
performed last Sunday morning.
For some hours after the operation the
patient seemed to be resting easy, but on
Tuesday afternoon he began to sink. Mr.
McCoppin had been in poor health for
nine months past, but went to the hospi
tal only last week.
As soon as the news of the Postmaster's
death had been received at the Postoffice
the Postmaster-General at Washington
was notified by Assistant Postmaster R.
E. Doyle. Tie bondsmen of the deceased
Postmaster met at noon, but adjourned
until 3 o'clock in the afternoon. They
then appointed Assistant Postmaster'
Doyle to act as Postmaster until McCop
pin's successor shall have been appointed
by President McKinley. Tuts action was
decided unon by W. F. Goad, G. F. Farco
and Matthew Nunan, who, with Lloyd
Tevis and C. N. Fekon, both of whom are
now out of town, are the bondsmen of the
deceased official.
It is believed that President McKinley
will soon appoint a successor to 'McCop
pin, whose term would not have expired
until a year. from next July. It is un
likely that the appointee of the bonds
men will hold office until the expiration
of his predecessor's term..
Among the candidates for the position
who had made application supposing
that the office would, not bacoma vacant
before July, 1898â are B. F. McKLnley, an
uncle of the President; Daniel T.
Cole and others. It is understood that
Congressman Loud has the position at
his disposal, although he refuses to say
whether he has not.
McCoppin received the appointment of
Postmaster of San Francisco from Presi
dent Cleveland on the 20th of June, 1894.
Frank McCoppin was born in Longford,
Ireland, July 4, 1834, and came with fits
parents to Morgan County, Illinois, in
1853. In 1853 he came to California and.
was one of tue moving spirits in the con
struction of the Market-street Railway, of
which he was superintendent. It was un
der his guidance that the sandhills were
cut through to the Mission. He was
elected Supervisor of the Eleventh Ward
in 1860 and served so satisfactorily tbat he
held the position for seven years, during
which period he served as chairman of
various important committees. . â¢ /-r.-
In 1867 he was made Mayor and during
his term of office many public improve
ments were made, most important among
them being the creation of Golden Gate
Park. From 1875 to 1878 he served as
State Senator and in such capacity he in
troduced and successfully promulgated
some important legislation, including the
one-twelfth act, which put a check upon
the powers of Boards ot Supervisors, and
tbe act creating the Board of Police Com
missioners.
One ot the most beneficent of bis pub
lic acts was in starting the movement, re
ducing streetcar fares in San Francisco to
the uniform rate of five cents. Before
the reduction four tickets were sold for a
quarter and a single fare was ten cents. . *
Mr. McCopp.n's next service was in the
capacity of president of the Board of
Harbor Commissioners. After that he
engaged in sugar raising in the Hawaiian
Islands. Subsequently ne returned to
California settling on a ranch in San Luis
Obispo County. In 1888 he was appointed
commissioner to the Melbourne Exposi
tion.
It was Frank McCoppin who, after a
careful study of the scale pest that in
fested* the fruit trees of California,' in
troduced into this State the . Australian
lady-bug which exterminated the pest and
saved the orchards from threatened ruin.
. \ Mr. McCoppin was ? possessed of great
physical strength, and was a man of com
manding presence. His was indeed a
"faultless physique," an expression of
which he himself was the autnor, and with
which his opponents sought at times to
annoy him. His bright eyes and healthy
complexion were but placed in relief by
his silver hair and closely cropped white
- beard. * â¢ ".:.... '<
He wa**, perhaps, one of the. most pro
gressive and energetic men who have ever
had an influence upon the affairs of the
State or municipality.
Arrangements have not yet been com
pleted for the funeral, which will probably
not be held for several days vet. A dele
gation of letter-carriers was sent to watch
over tbe body as soon as news of the Post
master's \ death had '. been . received. The
flags -ot ;. various public buildings were
lowered* to half-mastâ over the Postoffice,
the City Hall and the ; Chief Wharfinger's
office, the deceased at one time having

Commissioners.2

DECIDED VICTORY FOR THE
REPUBLICANS.
Senator White Sujrarests a Series
of Tables for Convenience
of the Public.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May ( 26.â The
first important skirmish of the tariff cam
paign in the Senate resulted to-day in a
decide victory for the Republicans. It
wr-s fought upon the question of whether
the duty on boracic acid should be 5 cents
a pound cr the Finance Committee rate
of 3 cents, as proj**o*-ed in the amendment
offered by Vest., The .fight was instruc
tive as an indication of what may be ex
pected in regard to every important item
in the bill, and the vote was suggestive of
the manner in which local interests affect
the action of Senators. Vest's amend
ment was defeated by a majority of 14â
two Democratic Senators (McEnery and
While) and three silverites (Cannon, Jones
of Nevada and Stewart) voting with the
Republicans. All Democrats not voting
were paired in the affirmative. Butler
(Pop.) and Mantle (Sil.) were paired in
the negative, while no pairs were an
nounced for Pettigrew and Teller (Sil.),
Kyle (Ind.) and Allen (Pop.)
Before the vote Aldrich, in opposing
Vest's amendment, said that representa
tives of the borax industry declared the
proposed rates on borax in its various
forms to be absolutely necessary.
Jcnrs of Arkansas read the prospectus
of a L'jndon company which proposed to
purchase of the Pacific Coast Borax Com
pany at San Francisco, showing that very
large profits have been made from the
busin ss for several years during which
the tariff on boracic acid was only 2J*,' cents
a pound. '
The next paragraph fixes the duty on
all alcoholic perfumery at 50 cents a pound
and 45 per cent ad valorem. Vest's mo
tion to put the duty at what it was under
the McKinley actâ s2 per gallon and 50 per
rent ad valorem â was rejected. A gallon,
he said, contained seven pounds, so the
propose.; duty of $4 20 a gallon and 40 per
cent ad valorem, Or about $5 a gallon on
an article valued at $1 40, might be char
acter. zed as "protection run mad."
i The next five paragraphs were quickly
disposed of, the 'committee amendments
being agreed to.
Paragraph 7|4, patting a duty of one
fourth of a cent a pound on bleaching
powder or chloride of lime, was onposed
by Gray, who said that it was on the
free list now and in the House bill, and
that the proposed duty would be a wanton
exercise of power to the injury of the pulp
makers and the paper manufacturers.
Quay said his attention had been called
to the matter this morning by a Pennsyl
vania paper manufacturer, woo wa< op
posed to the paragraph, and at Quay's re
quest the paragraph went over till to
morrow.
White (D. of California asked to
have inserted in the record, for conven
ience of the Senate and the public, a series
of tables as follows: Articles paying from
50 to 75 per cent under the pending bill;
articles paying from 75 to 100 per cent;
articles paying above 100 per cent; also a
statement showing the small amount of
importation of certain high-taxed articles,
indicating prohibitory duties; also a table
of articles more heavfiy taxed than in the
act of 1890. : JyJj; 'JJ,yfj
' Aldrich inquired where the information
was to come iron-, to which White replied
that Evans, the tariff expert, employed by
the minority of the committee, had taken
charge of the tabulations.
Jones (D.) of Arkansas asked Aid
rich if he had made any estimate of the
general average of the ad valorem rate
under his bill. Aldrich replied that he
had not, as it was a very hard thing to do.
The tariff bill was then laid aside, after
only three pages of the 217 had * been dis
posed of. â *'â¢â¢'*- J .
'â  The conference report on the sundry
civil appropriation bill was then taken
up and it was agreed that discussion of the
forest reservation matter should begin
early to-morrow and a vote be taken at

The Kansas Ex-Senator Hardly Noticed
by His Former Associates.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 26.âDur
ing the discussion on the tariff bill to-day
ex-Senator Ingalls entered the chamber
attired in. a Jong gray overcoat reaching
to his heels, steel-blue trousers with spots
to match, and carrying a broad-brimmed,
cream-colored felt hat. lngalts evidently
expected to create a stir, but if so he was
greatly disappointed. His reception by
the body of which he was so long a mem
ber and lor several years its presiding offi
cer, and always one of the most pictur
eYqu'e figures, was chilling. Not a Senator
felt his seat to greet him, and k the small
number of old colleagues who shook his
baud in passing, showed a striking lack of
cordiality. After sitting neglected on a
rear sola for awhile Ingalis passed out.
THE RECIFE*" CLAUSE,
Jfiffrrs in Important Particulars From
That of the McKinley Bill
WASHINGTON. D. C. May 26â The
reciprocity clause of the new tariff bill has
been prepared and will be introduced by
Burrows as an amendment to the bill. It
differs in one or two important particulars
Irora "a similar clause in the McKinley
law. The first portion of- the 'proposed
clause places a potent weapon in the
bands of the President by which he can
Increase duties 25 per cent on goods from
any country exporting to the United
States these articles in case they charge
the United States any greater duty on any
products than they charge other countries.
This will immediately apply to Cuba,
where Spain charges the -United States
?4 16 per barrel for flour and herself only
88 cents.
The President already has authority to
prohibit imports from countries which
discriminate against our product**, but as
this is an extreme measure it could only
bs resorted to in great emergencies. The
proposed clause could be aoplied without
serious friction, but the burden of duty
would b> sufficient to bring any country
to terms promptly. Tobacco is included
in the provisions of the proposed clause
as well as articles named in the act of
1890. The clause was written by Warner
0. button, for many years Consul-General
at various posts in Mexico. Sutton wrote
the first rough drafts also of the re
ciprocity clause of the act of 1890 for
Blame.
SES'ATOIiS LOCK HORNS.
Aldrich aud Hawley Nearly Come io
Blow. Over the Tariff.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 26.â The
new steering committee of the Senate ap
pointed for the purpose of guiding the
tariff bill through the Senate held its first
meeting at the Arlington Hotel to-night,
and was led to adjourn in order to -void a
personal encounter between two distin
guished Senators. A dispute arose as to
tome proposed amendments to internal
revenue schedules, and during the discus
sion Aldrich, the practical author and re
cognized sponsor of the bill, and Senator
Hawley of Connecticut, wno is more or
less dictatorial and emphatic,' locked
horns. The new Senator from Kentucky
(Deboe) also became involved in the
heated controversy, but being a raw re
cruit he was not so free in expressing his
opinion as the veteran Hawley, who is
particularly interested in rates on tobacco.
Becoming angered at a remark of Aldrich
Hawley gave unmistakable evidence of a
desire to settle the row with his ruts. But
at this point the sense of propriety of both
Senators and the wise counsel of others
prevailed, and the disputant-) were kept
apart. Before the meeting adjourned they

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 26.â The
Republican members of the Finance Com
mittee who were appointed by the caucus
to take charge of the tariff bill began their
work to-night. Such amendments as the
steering committee accepts will be offered
to the bill in the Senate as committee
amendments. The Republican managers
hope by. this plan to do away with almost
all debate from their side of the chamber
in the matter of urging desired modifica

THE SENATE IMPERTINENT.
Havemeyer's Attorney Says Some of the
Questions Asked the Sugar King Were
H ghly Improper.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 26.â The
prosecution in the case of Henry Have
meyer closed this afternoon.
It was evident from the day's proceed
ings that the defense would attempt to
show that Havemeyer, while he did not
answer the question referred to, did prac
tically give the information desired in bis
replies to other, questions. Attorney
Johnson, for the deiense, made an elab
orate argument and presented six points
for tne defense as a reason for a verdict
in favor of his client. He pictured the
question as unfair, irrelevant and in the
nature of an inquiry into a personal
matter with which the committee had
nothing to do. He detailed the conduct
of Havemeyer before the committee, in
tending to show that he had replied to all
the .questions which the committee had a
right to ask him, in the fullest possible
manner, but he drew the line when it went
into the private matters of the company.
Mr. Havemeyer "was too much of a gen
tleman," said Johnson, "to tell them it
was none of their business, but I say for
him that it was none of their business."
Johnson wanted to know why Senator
Allen wanted to dig into the affairs of
Senator-, and said that while it was good
to regulate the morals of other", it might
be better were some of this effort on the
part of moralists directed to bring morals
to themselves. "The question was as im
pertinent," said he, "as though he had
asked Havemeyer how many children,
or how much money, he had." Adjourned
till to-morrow.

The question of appointing a special
Embassador has been under consideration
for some time. No precedents were found
on which to base the appointment of a

anxious to confer the honor on Reid, but
he did not want to do anything that
might be construed as a slight to Hay, the

Grave Signs of the Decadence of
the Thrifty Guillotine In the
French Capital.
PARIS, France. May 26.â The celebra
ted Gregoire case ended this evening in
the conviction of the three aroused per
sons. Pierre Gregoire was sentenced to
penal servitude for life, and his mother
and mistress, Louise Hashayes, were each
condemned to five years' imprisonment.
The prisoners were charged with having
caused the death in December last of Gre
coire's son, 3 years old. He was made. to
stand on a hot stove, and to struggle for
food with a dog. He was beaten frequently,
and at times his tormentors would cut him
with knives.
The father would put a lump of sugar
on the child's head and bid the dog jump
for it. In doing so the animal would
scratch the boy's face, which afforded
amusement to the inhuman parents. Fin
ally the helpless child was abandoned in
the street on a freezing night. Ho was
found unconscious and died in a hospital.
The police investigation led to the arrest
of the guilty one*;, a clew being furnished
by a few words muttered by the boy in his

The evidence presented at the trial,
which began yesterday, created a sensa
tion. The courtroom was crowded, and
when some particularly damaging point
was brought out the audience would
shcut: "A mortl" "A mart!" When
Gregoire was sentenced be said : "Ask soci
ety to pardon me for the crime I have
committed.''
Gregoire was a house painter by trade,
but â  a loafer. The women were of bad

WICHITA, Kass.. May 26.â A romance
and Â° double tragedy in which the trio of
actors were young peonle living about fif
teen miles north of Medford, Grant Coun
ty, Oklahoma, occurred last week and the
news reached here to-nay. The outlines
of the sad story are as follows:
In a remote portion of Grant County
there is a Bohemian colony consisting of a
dozen or more families principally of
young people, with the parent stock in
Sumner County, this State. Among them
is a young girl named- Katie Urban,
daughter of Joseph* Urban, â  one of the
wealthiest Bonemian farmers in Bluff
Township, Sumner County. Miss Urban
is said to have tbat quality of face and
form tnat stirs up the love and jealousies
of men, bein â¢ quite a rustic beauty.' She
has a claim in her own right and is very
popular among the members of that neigh
borhood.
Near her lived Vaclaz ZÂ»lebok.
legs are deformed. He is **.2 years of a c.
It has been demonstrated time and again
that a cripple tan love as hard as any
other man, but not of course as effect
ively. At any rate. Zelebok loved Miss
Katie with tremendous fervor and he pro
posed to win her at all hazards. His rival
w*.s Joseph Hajek, a good-fojbing young
farmer of 18. This young fellow. was the
favorite of Mies Urban, although not of
her parents. His attentions to Miss Ur
ban and her smiles upon him made the
cripple jealous. "> '**
Saturday night Zelebok learned that
Hajek had gone courting Miss Urban, and
being unable to restrain the \ madness of
his jealousy any linger, he armed himself
and followed. When he reached Mss
Urban's house he saw his rival through
the window and immediately blazed away
with a 44 caliber revolver, hitting him
three times. One of the bullets sent
Hojek's collar-button clear through his
neck. _
The Bohemians of the settlement being
aroused they followed Zelebok, and after
capturine him brought /nim, to Caldwell,
in Kansas/instead of tailing him to the
county seat of Grant County. Kansas
having no jurisdiction over the crime
Z -lebok was released and started back into
the strip. Tuesday night the. Sheriff ar
rested him. -lebok asked to go Into a
room of his hou-e to get some clothes and
the ] Sheriff permitted him to do so." He
soon afterward came out and th"v entered
a buugy and started fjr Pond Creek, the
county --eat. On the way, near Medford,
the Sheriff noticed that his prisoner was
ill and in a short time, he died in great
agony. When he bad gone into his room
he secured some strychnine and had swal
lowed it.
Ttie double tragedy is a matter of much
regret among, not only the Bohemians of
the colony, but those of the mother col
ony, near Caldwell, Kans-

THE SENSATIONAL SCOOFY.
Says He Tried to Shoot Lawyer Totten Be
cause He Became Enraged at His ;
Ci ward ice.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 26â Leoni
das Scoofy,^ formerly of San Francisco,
who attempted to shoot Howe Totten, a
young Washington, attorney, waived his
preliminary examination this morning,
and was held to appear before the Grand
Jury. He furnished bail in the sum of
$3000. .
The real cause of his attempt to kill
Totten is a mystery. There have been a
dozen different stories circulated. All at
tempts to obtain interviews from the in
terested parties have been unsuccessful,
until Mr. Scoofy was seen by a Call rep
resentative to-night and made the follow
ing statement;
"The entire trouble was caused by Mr.
Toiten having in his possession certain
papers which lie obtained in a cowardly
manner. The fact that he yielded when
confronted by me seemed to me to he a
confirmation of what I Knew of his con
temptible character, and this so enraged
me that I attempted to kill him."
, Mr. fccoofy is well known in San Fran
cisco. His father was a wealthy Greek,
one of the California pioneers, and young
Scoofy is Â£ a native son of the Golden
West. It is said that the elder Scoofy left
a considerable estate. One of his daugh
ters married Henry Highton of San
Francisco.
Lsonidas Scoofy and his sister went to
New York from San Francisco nine years
ago, when Leonidas was abouf*2o years of
age.
They lived at the New York Hotel in the
winter and at Cranstown, West Point, in
the summer. Later the ccoofys, with
their mother, lived at the Hoffman House
and at the Albemarle until they removed
to Washington. -:'^JJyyjk
It is said that Miss Scoofy was a very
spirited young woman and once struck an
Englishman across the face with her fan
for making remarks derogatory to the
character of American women, and tbat
this created something of a sensation in
society.
The Scoofys came to Washington to
live several years ago, Leonidas acting as
private secretary to Congressman Barllett
of New York. He is a handsome young
.fellow, well educated and - has traveled
extensively in Europe and South America.
His personal attractiveness' made him a
favorite in Washington society. Here he
met Miss Lonsdale, a society girl. :
-'Last December a dispatch to The Call
announced their engagement, but to the
surprise of all their friends they eloped to
Baltimore the next day and were married.
This was done because the relatives of Mr.
Scoofy opposed the . match. Mrs.
Scoofy, (nee Lonsdale) is now lying
at the point of death in a New York bos
pital, Buffering from an Ã¼bÂ«C3-s. Mr.
Scoofy says he does not expect her to live
more than a few days. She is said to be
unawaie of tbe attempted shooting.
The * are several different versions of
this difficulty, but it appears that Scoofy,
accom* anied by Miss Willie Lonsdale,
visi:ed Lawyer Totten's office here, and,
a ter locking the door, demanded certain
papers which the lawyer had in his pos
session. ;.. -
He consented to give them up, but not
withstanding this Mr. Scooty became en
raged and attempted to shoot Totten with
a pistol. t-coofy's finger was caught in
the hammer of the gun, which prevented
its discharge. They clinched and Totten
managed to hold Scooly until the door
was broken open by friends, who came to
the lawyer's assistance.
Lawyer Totten is said to have been en
gaged to Miss Lonsdale before Scoofy
married her. y.-.y . â _ ..*.- .;â 
.., Mr. Scoofy. justly and indignantly re
sents the insinuation that bis wife is in a
delicate condition. The New York papers
have published crue' statements to the
effect that the quarrel Mr. Scoofy bad with
the lawyer was on account of indiscreet
conduct on the part of Mrs. Scoofy before
she was married. : , *.
Mr. ecoofy says he does not believe
that Totten will coLtinue his prosecution,
but that the case will be dismissed. He
will insist, however, that Lawyer Totten
eive up. the papers in his possession.
If 'lie does M Mr. Scooiy will
insist upon the case coming to trial, for
the young man ieels confident that any
jury, after hearing the evidence against
Totten, would acquit him of the intent to
kill tbe lawyer.
Mr. Scoofy's lawyers declare that if he
had killed his man any jury in the world
would have acquitted him.
AGAIN IN THE ARCHIVES.
The Old Bradford Log Returned to Mas

Speech-Making.
BOSTON. Mass., May 26.â The famous
log of Governor Bradford is again in this
State and in the archives of the common
wealth. â  -j. JJ j J_'jV J'S'
Belore a distinguished gathering in the
House of Representatives this morning,
including botn branches of. the Legislature
and the executive council, the former
Embassador, Bayard, as the representa
tive and messenger of Great Britain, placed
the document in the bands of Governor
Wolcott, as the representative of the com
monwealth and the designated custodian
of the manuscript. â ' â 
Senator Hoar, as one who had taken a
1 ad.ns part in the restoration of the
manuscript, made an address upon its
character and history.
Mr. Bayard spoke without notes or
manuscript, and had an enthusiastic re
ception. His speech sounded the desire
of the speaker for international good will,
and showed that he regarded the occasion
as one fraught with ~, the greatest sig
nificance, from the fact that it was in a
sense international, and represented the
feeling ;of amity between the mother
country and the Natl* n which was founded
on Plymouth plantation. He said in part:
"If it be a sin to long for the, strength
and safety of your country then _>* have
been a great sinner, for I have been striv
ing to advance the honor- and safety and
welfare of my country, and oelieve it thus
accomplished by treating others with jus
tice and j: courtesy, and doing to them
those things whicu we asked to have done
to ourselves."
Senator Bradford of Hampden, a lineal
descendant^ of â¢ the author of the
manuscript history, : presented --â  a _ reso
lution of thanks to the Bishop of London,
the English Consistorial Court and the
Queen for re*-torin**** the 5 manuscript, and
the resolution was unanimously adopted.

Boston Boy Grea-ly Outclassed.
Saved From a knockout by
the Kind Referee.
NEW YORK. N. V., May 26.â 1n the
tenth round, with Dick O'Brien of Boston
bleeding from the nose and both eyes,
and coughing -from the blood which he
had accidentally swallowed, Referee
Charlfy White stopped the glove fight at
the Palace Attletic Club to-night and de
clared "Xid 1, McCoy the victor.'- -" ~
The battle demonstrated beyond a ques
tion of doubt that the fighter who de
ponds on slugging does not always defeat
the pugilist who couples scientific boxing
with bard hitting. McCoy beat O'Brien
as severely as Creedon did, and the meet
ing of the "Kid" and 'the Australian is
now necessary to decide who is the best
middle-weight outside of Pitzsimnions. *
McCoy's tactics in the. ring were a reve
lation. Few persons in the big crowd ex
pected to see him so completely outclass
the sturdy Boston fighter. In height and
reach .McCoy had such an advantage that
it was half the victory for him. In knowl
edge of ring generalship he was also far
in. advance of his opponent, and ,in the
swiftness and accuracy with which all his
blows were delivered he showed that he is
a dangerous proposition for any fighter to
tackle. :y - x ,
O'Brien's sole object in view was to rush
and mix things up and take chances of
landing one of his heavy wallops on the
"Kid's" jaw. . He adopted these methods
almost from the start, and before the first
round .was over he found McCoy was
the hardest man to hit he had ever met in
the ring.
McCoy's ramrodlike left was a buffer for
Dick's face every time the Boston man
rushed, and as â  result. O'Brien began to
bleed in th- first round. As the battle
progressed McCoy showed that he is any
thing but a "brutal prize-fighter." He
seemed to have compassion for his unfor
tunate rival, and on various -'Cca-ions
carefully refrained from taking advantage
of openings which offered. When O'Brien
was seen to be in distress in the last
round, McCoy looked appealingly to the
referee, who," with timely interferenc**,
saved O'Brien from the humiliation of a
knockout, v., , rÂ , * -
Six thousand sports saw the fight.
When McCoy left the ring he didn't have
a scratch on his face. His opponent's
countenance was severely battered and
both eyes were almost closed. O'Brien
admitted his defeat, and when the crowd
cheered him for his pluck he sobbed
aloud. " <, ',? r

RENEW HIS
POLAR HUNT
Five Years' Leave of Ab

Explorer.
TELLS OF HIS PLANS TO
SUCCEED.
Himself and the Surgeon the
Only Civilized Members of
the Party.
WILL LEAVE EVEN __1"S WIFE
BEHIND.
His Great Faith In the Eskimos,
Dogs and Plenty of Land
Supply Depots.
NEW YORK, N. V.. May 26.â ap
plication of Explorer Peary for live years'
leave of absence to continue Pis Arctic ex
plorations was granted to-day by Secre
tary Long. Mr. Peary said he hoped to
accomplish the conquest of the north
pole, the complete delineation of the
Greenland archipelago last of the
circumpolar island groups â and the elim
ination from the maps of the unknown
area between the eighty-fourth parallel
una the pole.
Preliminary to his polar expedition
J^eary will make a trip to Whale Sound on
the northwest coast of Greenland. He will
start on his preliminary voyage July 10,
and several -scientific parties will accom
pany him. He says:
"A year from the coming July I propose
to start on the main expedition. How
much time this will consume it is impos
sible to si y. Possibly, under certain con
ditions, 1 might ao it in two years; per
haps not in lour.
"This expedition will differ from most
Arctic expeditions in that the only civil
ized members will be myself and the sur
geon. My wife, who will accompany me
on the preliminary expedition, will not
po further north. More white people in
the party I believe would only lesson the
chances of success, as they consume more
lood, and that has to be of more dainty
variety than the Eskimos needs. I can
depend upon the Eskimos whom I shall
select.
"Leaving the ship at Whale Sound with
about six families of Eskimos who will
meet me there, I shall push up the coast
till I reach Sherard Osborne Fjord, in
about latitude SI. Here I shall establish
a colony and base of supplies. Between
this colony and Whale Sound I shall keep'
up â¢Â» constant line of communication by
means of dogs and sledges. The site of
this colony I expect to reach in the latter
part of August or early in September.
Several months will be consumed in col
lecting supplies.
"In the dash for the pole I shall start
about March. We shall push on until we
find the termination of Greenland and
from there our track will be across the
ice. We shall take all our supplies with
us on sledges. How far land extends to
the north no one knows, and this I hope
to find out.
"When there is land for a basis then
there is some fixed point to return to, and
depots can also be established as one ad
vances. Nansen has proved how unreli
able a ship is as a basis owing to the
tendency of drifting ice to carry her
hundreds of miles from where she was
left. Eskimos can also be relied upon on
this route, and they are far the best fitted
for what I propose to do. Na.nsen's
farthest point north was 86 deg. 14 mm. I
hope to advance bayond this, and if possi
ble reach the pole. If I fail I shall try
again." -
SELF-IMMOLATION IN RUSSIA.
Recovery of the Bodies of Two Dozen :
Fanatics Who Were Voluntarily
Buried Alive.
LONDON, E>-g., May 26.â Details have
been received from Odessa of the self-im
molation of a number of fanatical follow
ers of Ra**kolink!, a report of which was
first received two weeks ago. More than
twenty-four bodies' of persons who were
buried alive have been recovered from a
series of pit-* near Tiraspol.
The seel is a survival of the old dis
senters, who were persecuted in Russia
for two centuries. Their treatment was
worse under Empress Sophia, when thou
sands were knouted by the State. .The
result was that they became fiercely fanat
ical and invented the doctrine of salva
tion by martyrdom. They are now prac
ticing self-immolation. â¢*. '.*.; ;-ll
Six bodies were accidentally discovered
on the premises of Veodore Kovaleff, who
confessed that he had walled up in his
cellar nine living persons, including his
wife and two young children. He further
admitted that, he had buried six others,
while they were still alive, in a specially
excavated pit eight feet deep.
Kovaleff. declares that all were volun
tary victims. In an adjoining garden, be
longing to Matvei Susula, four.' bodies
were discovered in a pit. Sukula says
they were buried alive at their own - re
quest. A large number of persons, includ
ing many foreigners, among who is an
American touring party, are visiting the
scene.
OF INTEREST TO THE COAST.
Special Treasury Agent Moore Suggests
Moderate Opium Duties Posicffices,
Patents end Fensiuns.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 26.â H. A.
Moore, special treasury agent at San
Francisco, has written Secretary Gaeo a
letter, which was to-day transmitted to
the Finance and. Ways and Moans com
mittee?, in which he. volunteers- the
opinion that the proposed increase of
duty on opium from ?6 to $8 would be in
advisable, as : it will tend to : promote
smuggling and will reduce the revenue
lrom this source. He gives the following
figures for San Francisco, the principal
opium port:
In June, 1896, 98,745 pounds were im
ported, and all but a few hundred pounds
of it passed through the Custom-house.
He shows that trie importations at $6 ncr
pound were considerably large- than
under, the highe- rates of $10 and $12 per
pound. From 18SD to 1833 at $6 per pound
there was imported 127,000 pounds; from
1884 to 1890, at $10 per pound, only 60,000
pound*-; irom 18' JO to 1894, at $12, only
60.000 pounds; from 1894 to 1896, at $6,
130,000 pounds. ''.-;.".
He estimates that for this fiscal year the
amount will reach 144,000 pounds, yield
ing a revenue of about $864,000. He says
the Mongolian race* are declining in num
ber in â  California, and the increase in
opium importations is due to the $6 duty,
which has reduced smuggling to a point
where it. does not pay to smuggle.

money, which had been supplied by two
unnamed gamblers of Santa Monica.
McCarthy claims that bis companion*?
in' the crime were Jones, who turned
States' evidence and escaped and is now
in Washington State; a man named Hen
derson, who is now in Nicaragua, and
another man who has since died and is
nameless.
The quartet of conspirators employed
two men at $2 a day to labor in the tunnel,
under' the impression that they were in
search of hid en treasure that had been
buried by Don Pio Pico.
When it became necessary to tell these
two men of the real character of the work
they were engaged in, for fear they would
disclose the scheme, the laborers both
skipped out in fear, leaving only the arch
conspirators to carry on the work.
The work of digging the tunnel was
prosecuted between 11:30 o'clock at night
to 4:30 o'clock in the morning. The air
in the tunnel was to foul that candles
would not burn in it unless a constant
stream of fresh air was pumped into it.
The details of the daily operations, as
related by the prisoner, would read like a
romance, but there are circumstances to
verify all the statements of the man who
claims that he never yet has seen a safe
he could not open in twenty minutes, and
yet this id the first time he was ever con
victed of a crime.
Suspecting that outside help was ready
to assist in the escape of McCarthy, Sher

man off for San Quentin in charge of two
deputies.
As McCarthy had claimed he would es
cape before he could be landed in prison
an additional precautionary measure was
taken in the form of an Oregon boot-

VICTORIA, B. C, May 26.â The Jap

but one which in the Chinese-Japanese
war took part in the thickest of the Yel
low Sea fight, arrived here this afternoon.
After a stay of a week it will go to Seattle,
returning home via Hawaii.
This is tbe first time the Heyai has been
abroad. It is composite built, of 2*200 tons,
and carries, all told, a crew of 325, includ
ing 18 naval cadets.
In the Yellow Sea fight in November,
1895, with the Chinese, the Heyai had a
thrilling experience.. Being slower than
its consorts it lag_ed somewhat behind,
and taking advantage of this the I Chinese
ships Ting Yuen and Pin Yuen, the form

broadsides into the Heyai. ..,.'â 
The captain undertook the bold expe

two Chinese ships : and then discharging
broadsides as it- passed. The Heyai, by
this plucky maneuver, got in the rear cf

BADLY WHIPPED
Castellanos Meets With
a Series of Dis
asters.
Compelled to Retreat After
Eight Days' Continuous
Fighting.
Loses Five Hundred Menâ The Sur
vivors Nearly Dead From
Exhaustion. /
PUERTO PRINCIPE, Cuba, May 26.â
General Jim Inez Castellanos has returned
after eight days' military operations
against the insurgents along the river San
Pedro. He started from Puerto Principe
with 3033 infantry, 570 cavalry and two
cannon, according to the official report.
During his eight days' march he was
constantly righting with the Cubans, and
was obliged to return here ,on account of
his great losses and the exhaustion of his
troops. He could not force the insurgents
to engage in a pitched tattle and did not
dare to divide his forces into small bands
and follow the Cuban tactic .
The result was that he made use of. his
artillery, and also fired an average of
40,000 rifle shots an hour without doing
any damage to the enemy, who scattered
all around his column, and kept swiftly
approaching and retiring from his front
line. The Cuban forces, composed wholly
of cavalry, numbered mors than 2000.
Near Ojo de Aqua the Cubans stood
against the Spanish column for six hours
and compelled Castellanos to array his
men in two flanks, with the artillery in the
center. In this engagement the Cubans
lost 80 men and the Spaniards 150.
Three Cuban girls were found on the
road by the Spaniard*! and brought before
Jiminez Castellanos. Asked about the in
surgents they gave false information, re
sulting in a surprise by the Cuban cav
alry, who made a fierce attack on the
Spaniard's left flank.
The insurgents, with constant volleys
from all sides, obliged Castellanos to keep
his column in battle order all right. Next
morning he retired to the estate El Cairn
ito, which he bombarded with artillery
and the Cubans abandoned it.
Castellanos then began his retreat to
Puerto Principe. He had lost 400 men
and his soldiers were tired to death. It
took him three days to get back to the
city, during which time the Cubans gave
him no rest and killed and wounded 100
more of his men.

child.
Th's she started to do, but , she was
seized by cramps in the feet and could not

BREAK FROM FRESNO'S JAIL.
Wilson and Hall, Two Desperate Thugs,
Saw Their Way Through the Grating
of Their Cell.,
FRESNO, Cal., May 26.â Two desperate
criminals broke out of the county jail
about 1 o'clock this morning, and though
the officers have searched the county in
all directions, the fugitives are still at
large.
| They .are James Wilson and Prank
Hall, the thugs who "held up" a half
dozen of Fresno's citizens within a few
: hours one night last January. ."â 
J. They were captured on a steamboat ply
ing between Stockton and San Francisco,
and when near i the * wharf at the latter
i place made â ; a futile . effort to. escape by
jumping into the bay. They had been con- '
fined in jail here awaiting trial.
Their escape was accomplished with the
neatness . and A dispatch of ; > experienced
criminals. â  They sawed an opening in the
crating across the top of their cells. They,
then climbed to the * skylight and broke
through it.
Sliding down the roof to the eaves, they
fastened the corner of a blanket to a ven
tilator, and by -means fof ' this lowered
themselves to the cround. The jailer was
asleep. They ran* down "M- street in a
southerly direction. o
'-;-.' Policeman Clifton saw them and gave
: pursuit, but the s escapes were â¢ too fleet of
foot for him. ;He fired three shots at
them/ but they paid no heed to the
bullets.
-How -the prisoners procured the saw
with which they cut their way to freedom
is a puzzle.* They used soap, and rags to
deaden the sound of the saving and had
probably been at work on the job for two
or three weeks.
: The fugitives had about three hours in
which to travel ; in the darkness, and it is
believed that at daylight they went into
hiding for the day. About thirty men are
out guarding every : possible avenue of
escape.
This is the first escape from the jail
since Chris Evans and Ed Morrell at the
Doinis of pistols compelled Jailer Ben
Scott to unlock the doors for them three
years ago. '.:â '-. jJ- J'-jAy-yy..
VALLEJO SAFE ROBBED.
Cracksmen Enter a Grocery-Store and
Make a Rch Haul in Gold
and Silver.
VALLEJO, Cal., May 26.â The grocery
store of James Brownlie, one of the lead
ing merchants of this city, was entered by
cracksmen early this morning ana the
safe robbed of nearly $1500 in gold and sil
ver coin. The exact amount taken is not
known, as several persons had deposited
money in the strongbox for safe-keeping.
Brownlie himself had upward of $1000 in
the safe. His son John had $120 on de
posit and Justice of the Peace James La
mont loses a sack containing $300. The
cracksmen also took a couple of handfulls
of foreign coins of different denomina
tions. Several watches in the j safe were
undisturbed." A number of checks, notes,
Government bonds and Vallejo Water
bonds were examined and thrown on the
â¢ floor.
Brownlie was the first to discover the
loss. The front store doors were found
open and those of the safe within were
ajar. Papers littered the floor. From a
sKylieht over the office a pane of glass was
missing, and dangling through the open
ing was a piece of cotton rope about an
inch in diameter, such as is used in fisher
men's nets. The safe-robbers had evi
dently entered through the skylight and
departed by the door.
As the safe, which was considered burg
lar-proof, was found intact, the robbers
were evidently expert cracksmen and had
worked the combinations without trouble.
Brownlie notified the officers and a
close inspection of the premises was made.
A ladder standing at the rear of the
building had been used to gain access to
the roof of the store. A large pocket-knife
was used to cut out the wood part of the
skyligbt-sa*Â«h. A pry was then placed
under the pane to keep it from falling to
the floor below, but a portion of the glass
had broken and dropped down. â¢ >* ; *'.: *.*?
After the glass had been removed, one
end of the rope which the .burglars
brought with them was fastened around
an adjacent brick chimney and the other
end passed down through the opening to
the floor below, a distance of twelve feet.
Down this rope the burglars had slid and
gained an entrance to the office.
Two safes were standing side by side.
The one in which the books were kept was
left undisturbed. â¢
Persons living in the vicinity of the
store say that about 4 o'clock this morn
ing they heard the barking of dogs and
the sound of breaking glass.
Some years ago this store was robbed,
and then Brownlie purchased the safe he
owns at present. The makers offered a
reward of $1-00 to any one who could
break into it within twenty-four hours.
BURGLARY AT FALLBROOK.
Cracksmen Enter the Town PostcfUce and
Acqu.re the Contents of Is
Safe.
FALLBROOK.CaI., May 26.â The post
office here was robbed early this morning.
Burglars effected; an entrance by prying
open a window. .1. â¢-*<.". "!
The safe was opened by using a hy
draulic jack to pull the handle. It was a
common fire- proof affair, ana by this
method the tumblers were released.
About $300 in stamps and money and the
registered mail were taken.
After opening the door the burglars un
screwed the combination plate and exam
ined the working parts, placing the
screws and works in the pigeon-holes.
Professor Adams of the High School
noticed a dim light in the rear at
12:30 o'clock on going to mail a
letter, but thought it might be a reflection
from the note . where a Foresters' supper
was in progress.' The office was locked as
usual at 8 p. m. by the postmaster's son,
E. W. Rice. Two suspected tramps are
being looked for.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 26. -T. H.
Goodman, general passenger agent of the
Southern Pacific Company, passed through
Sacramento, yesterday afternoon on his
return from a brief business trip to Chi
cago. Mr. Goodman, while at Chicago,
perfected an arrangement regarding the
routing |of the Oregon travel coming by
the way of the Union Pacific, which will
be of particular Interest to Sacramento.
Heretofore 1 such travel has not come
through California at all, but diverged :
from the Union Pacific at Granger, some
distance east of Ogden, and went over the j
Oreeon Short Line. Under the arrange- j
ment made by Goodman, on behalf of the I
Southern Pacific, with the Union Pacific
people, such travel will hereafter be di- j
verted over the Central Pacific, coming on
to Sacramento and going thence to Port- '
land and points in the Northwest. The
same route will be followed by east-bound i
travel. \ ln each instance a* stop-over of I
about eight hours will be made at Sacra- j

Stockton Asylum Shortage.'
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 26.â Some
time ago an action was brought by State
Controller Colgan and the directors of the
Stockton Insane Asylum against N.M. Orr,
treasurer of that institution, and his bonds
men, it being charged that Orr received
$787,837 belonging to the State and failed
to account for $10,000 of that amount.
An answer to the original complaint was
filed this morning in the Superior Court
of this county on behalf of Orr and his
bondsmen. â "â  â "--' ..*--.â .-;.â¢ - â  ;
. The answer denies that the official bond
of Orr was approved; by the board of di
rectors, and denes that the approval of
the bond was placed upon the bond.
/It asserts thÂ«t Orr had been given not
more than *i s77s,37B, for all of which he
accounted, and that he owes the State
nothing. **

MORRIS PARK, N. V., May 26.- The
special race at a mile, j arranged for the
great four-year-olds, Handspring and Re
quital, to be the star attraction, for
charity day at Morris Park, was probably
the poorest contest ever seen between
horses of such high reputation. Requital
was the favorite, but was ingloriously de
feated; in fact, he performed so badly,
that the talent, amazed and dumfonnded,
will not accept to-day's race as the Brook
dale crack's true form. Many would not
be surprised if to-morrow would bring
forth the announcement that the four
year-old had again been stricken with the
dread influenza, which is now ravaging
the strings of horses at Morris Park,
Gravesend and Sheephead Bay. The mile
was run in the poor time of 1:45 and the

RACING AT SACRAMENTO.
Managers Hint That They Intend to
Conduct a Two Months' Meet'

SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 26â The
trotters and pacers had an inning in the
third day's racing under the auspices of
the Capital City Driving Association, and
drew a large attendance, bat there was not
as much money in evidence as during the
running events of yesterday. The meet
ing has been so successful that it will be
extended another wees, as there, is every
indication that good racing will be liber
ally patronized by Sacramentans. Should
the extra week's racing come up to ex
pectations, a two months' race-meeting
will be given here, commencing on June
10. .'-; i'--",*:. . yy-\
The day opened with a pace for two-year
olds, with Diawood the favorite at $10 to
$5 for ' the field. He carried away the
honors despite his unsteadiness. His
frequent breaks cost him the second heat,
for, although he came under the wire ten
lengths to the good, the judges disquali
fied him, giving the heat to Esther C,
which had cut out a pace that kept the
favorite in the air more than half the
time.
In the second race, trotting and pacing,
Faro Bank, selected for favoritism, won
the first, fourth and -fifth heats, taking
first money, Jessie P second and Palatina
.third.-- 1 -' 7V./ ; , 'â¢ \ :
The* third race was a running event,
with seven entries. Dick Ledgett, who
engineered tbe start,* sent the bunch off
perfectly. Heartsease made the running
to the eighth pole, leading by two lengths,
with 'â â  La Fleeha close ,up and the rest
bunched. Adam Andrew, who sold a hot
favorite, was in the rear. At this point
Chiwsou 'began ' working ; the ! favorite
through the bunch, and in the stretch he
came up with - the leaders, winning by a
head from La ; Fleeha, with Heartsease
third. At the pole La *" Fleeha; .'and the

May Be a Device to Scare the In
quisitive Away From a
Rich Find..
TOMBSTONE. Ariz., May 26. -A weird
ghost story comes from the old Bronco
mine, three miles southeast of here. Many
citizens, supposedly truthful and reliable,
relate wonderful talcs of the strange sights
and sounds nightly in the old mine, and
these hava been repeated with such insist
ence and with such circumspection of
detail that at last people have cea-ed to
scoff and sneer, and an investigating party
is being made up of volunteers to go down
into the mine and pass a night at the
bottom of the shaft. - Hi-fi -.-<,*
According to the stories told by eye
witnesses, two/hours after sunset, with
clock-like regularity, a tall, white or lumi
nous, wraith-like form stalks --bout among
the diggings and passes through the old
adobe shanty near the mouth of the main
shaft. .: Many of the mountaineers and
plainsmen of the neighborhood are with
out', superstition and these have tried to
catch the specter. . They have shot at him
time and again, and often irom very close
range. They have tried to corner him
and sense his substance by material touch,
but always he has vanfshsd at the critical
moment, only to reappear at a little dis
tance. . *
At midnight he ceases his wanderings
on the upper levels and goes below and to
work. For hours ;he has been heard at
work in the deserted. drifts, now pound
ing drills, now sawing timbers, now blast
ing. He works along as industriously as
though silver had never depreciated, and
bis labors are so unceasing that half the
population have' heard them and really
believe that the weird sounds and sight's
are genuine.
The Bronco mine has a bloody history,
that w-,-11 entitles it to its ghostly tenant.
In the early days it was one of the richest
mines of the Tombstone district. Dissen
sions over the division of the profits arose
among its owners, and occasionally, as
these quarrels ripened, a man or two dis
appeared. .Shooting-affairs! were numer
ous at the mine. At one time in the early
'80's five : men were found at -the; Bronco
with ; their ' toes pointing skyward. Later
on the mine became an ideal rendezvous
for the freebooters and stage- robbers, and
once Â«* gang of these -who had robbed a
Wells-Targo bullion wagon fought over a
division of the spoils and killed each other
âto the last man. ", *
One reasonable explanation is offered
to account for the appearance of the sup
posed. wraith in the mine. It Is that some
one who is acquainted with the Bronco
has found a pocket of rich ore, which he
is working at night, while, in order that
he ;" may remain . unmolested, ,he ' dons
ghostly raiment, calculated to keep the in
quisitive at their distance.

STANFORD'S GIFT
TO HER SENIORS
Diplomas Awarded to
the Graduates at
Palo Alto.
Professor Jenkins r Delivers
the Commencement
Address.
Parting Words of Advice From
President Jordan to the
Class of *97.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY,. CaI., May
26.â The graduation exercises took place
in Encina gymnasium this morning.
After prayer .. Professor Jenkins delivered
the commencement address, his subject
being "The * Passing of " Plato." The
speaker dwelt upon the stupendous
changes wrought -in' the material life of
the civilized races by the progress of
modern science,' and in closing said :
When we come to consider the vastness of
well-ordered real knowledge at the present
time, the intensity of intellectual activity,
me great number of important problems
thrust upon us, the crowds of errors as well
as the multitudes of truths that crowd upon
our judgment, and the fierce competition on
every hand, requiring the best equipment in
modern knowledge and method, there is the
most urgent reason that our educational sys
tem be cleared of everything that interferes
with its cleanest action.
The elementary system needs no longer the
endless patching up of its motley mixture,
the strange result of necessity, empiricism
and ace. dent. ii has had enough of the fanci
ful apologies of the philosophers for its exist
ence, auu of mystic pictures of Its fancied
relations to an imagined soul. It needs to be
completely reorganized from the foundation
and put iv relation to the life of to-day.
As for our higher schools, the universities,
they have become freer to react to the times.
They are every year becoming less under the
influence of the inane and inactive scholastic
ism which made the most narrow ot defini
tions of culture and set her up as a goddess
and established about her a puerile ritual and
a most bigoted hierarchy. First in Germany
and .hen in America the university broke
away, or is breaking away trom these oonds.
The uuiversitv is no longer to be simply the
conservator of the past. It should be the
leader and stimulus of the present and the
prophet ot; the luture. Every phase of intel
lectual activity should nave lis place in the
university, where Will be gathered its litera
ture, where may be collected Us facts and
where will be grouped masters in its science,
who stand ready lo impart its spirit and drill
in its methods. Throughout tne whole will
prevail thoroughly the scientific spirit and
method, and that complete freedom in choice
of subjects and career absolutely necessary to
strongest development.
Our own university in America most nearly
approaches in spirit such an ideal, and if sucn
a life here is not universal it is at least pos
sible to all, and many mere be who live with
enthusiasm up to this possibility. I congratu
late you that during your educational career
you have had the possibility ot breathing with
ireedom something ol the spirit o( the times.
May you that go and you tnat remain vividly
appreciate this too rare a privilege, ana cul
tivate and guard most jealously this spirit.
May it become an instinct with us. May we
be quiet to resent and ever ardeut to oppose
any taint of the old regime which may seek
admission among us, and thus threaten our
ireedom aud undermine our Intellectual man
hood. -V- -i--
Miss Palmer, as an alumni representa
tive, repeated her address delivered yes
terday at the association's annual meet
in*;. The diplomas wer**; then presented
to the graduates by Dr. Jordan. The
exercises were concluded with an address
to the students by Dr. Jordan. His sub
ject was the "Whole-some World.". His
closing wor-,3 were:
A generous education has opened for you a
thousand doors to successâ a thousand more
to failure. I lis your part to choose. To be
educated is a dangerous thing. The responsi
bility for choice is intensified a thousand
fold. But to be educated aright is to be tear
less of danger. It is to be prepared lor the
conquest oi danger.
Character is built up by doing the best yon
know. Effectiveness consists in doing the best
thing that any one can know. Effectiveness
in this sense is more than character. - It is the
second power of character. It is virtue
wrought into action.. An ignorant man or a
icolisn one may be good eu-.ug in a negative
way, but he cannot be very helpful. Toe best
he Knows is not the real best. But as educated
men and women we have the right to expect
the real best of you.
The enlightened conscience will resist all
forms of contamination. All that injures me
is bad. and equally bad is all that is harmful
toothers. Alt that weakens or destroys body,
mind or character must come under its con
demnation. We expect you as apostles of the
higher education to stand against wrong, re
sisting not only the positive vices and crimes,
but also the subtler evils of dilute virtue and
flabby morality. You will find among the in
fluences for evil the vast inertia of indolence
und lethargy. Weak books that destroy the
mind may be as dangerous as vice that eats up
the soul or crime that deforms the body.
Not all that is wrong wears the visible livery
of tne devil. The spirit of evil has all times
and all places for it-, activiiies. But of all the
delusions with which tne devil cheats the soul
< t man, the desire to get something for noth
ing is th? most widespread aud the most dan
gerous. Tne "deadhead" is the devil's sign
manual with which he brands his own, his
cheep as well as his goats. There is no lasting
joy without Its cost of effort, no privileges
without corresponding duties.no happiness
without responsibility.
The hope of somehow getting that which we
have not earned, whetner in power or privi
lege or enjoyment, is the chief source of hu
man misery. Happiness comes from striving,
doing, loving, achieving, conqueringâ always
something positive and iorceiu.. It cannot be
found in idleness. The pleasures of debauch
ery and dissipation are on.y counterfeits.
Each joy that comes through drugs or stimu
lants i< charged against us to be paid in mis
ery. The pleasures of dreaming are the joys
of fco s. : Only through realities come the
pleasures that last.
'Tis heaven alone that is given away." All
in life worth having has its price. . It must be
paid for In effort, in tears, in prayers; and can
be had on no cheaper terms. The gods main
tain no bargain-counter. Their favors are
never marked down â never going at a sacri
fice. Their prices are always the nighest, but
they always give full measure. They yield the
best and the best Is their r.eroand.
If you have learned this lesson and have
wrought it into your lives yours is Indeed the
spirit of- the higher education. To pay your
debts in life as you go, to ask for nothinr
without rendering its equivalent, is to do your
share in the work of the universe. Your life
shall make tbe world wholesome. .

Chair.
PHCENIX,. Ariz., May 20. âThe Repub
lican ol this city openly charges to-day
that Attorney-General Wilson, the chief
official on Governor Franklin's staff,
'has gone to Washington at the expense
of the Territory and with Governor
Franklin's consent to work against the
confirmation in the Senate of Colonel
McCord.'' who has just been appointed
Governor of Arizona by President Mc-
Kinley.' Dr. Cleveland and Burt Duhlap,"
both former residents of Ohio and both
candidates 'for. the Territorial Governor
ship, are said. to have a strong friend in
Senator. * Fo raker. who will/ oppose the
confirmation of McCord. It is with*' this
faction that. A'torney-Gencral Wilt-on is
expected to work, and he has gone armed
with a valise full of affidavits aDd | com
mittee reports. . : ' *
A fight will ; also . be .. made against the
confirmation of Charles Akers as Secre
tary of the Territory,', the leading spirit in
which is El S. Gill, a Washington corre
spondent, who once lived for a time in
Arizona. .'â ..".'.;;..-*;â :.,.
Ii is stated here on the authority; of
McCord's enemies that he has telegraphed
to this city.that unless his friends come
.o his rescue" at once and vigorously he
will be defeated in the Senate. McCord's
friends deny this, and declare that his
nomination will be confirmed in a few
days without any trouole.
The Phoenix "Herald (Republican) to
night accuses the McCord party of hav
ing entered into a secret agreement with
Utah whereby, in exchange for the sup
port of the Utah Senators, the McCord
administration will deliver to Utah that
strip of "no -man's land" lying between
the Grand Canyon and the Utah bound
ary, which Utah has been trying for years
to annex. - *-'-.'
DEFIES SAUSALITO S MARSHAL.
Armed With * a Revolver, a Housewife
V"> y Rests . the Serving of an
Attachment.
SAUSALITO, Cat-,'. May 2C- Marshal
John E. Creed of Sausalito had a new ex
perience and one which be will not soon
forget yesterday. While attempting, to
obtalnposiession of a piano he was com
pelled to face the frowning muzzle of an
English bulldog revolver in the hands of
an Irate woman.
A suit to replevin a piano was brought
in Justice J. S. Belleude's court against
B. A. Scblon, and tbe writ commanding
the Marshal to obtain possession of the
piano was placed in Creed's hands for ser
vice. Armed with this legal authority
Marshal Creed engaged the services of
La Rue Lemar, an expressman, to go with
him to the Scbloh residence, near Waldo
Point, about a mile from Sausalito.
When they arrived at the house . tbev
found Mrs. Schioh at home alone. The
Marshal explained why he had come, ana
that it would be necessary to take the
piano away.
Mrs. Schioh got excited and told the
officer that she would not allow him to
take the instrument. Creed firmly but
forcibly informed her that be had come
for the piano, and that he would not leave
until be obtained it.
Rushing to a table upon which lay a re
volver, Mrs. Schioh seized it and leveled
it at the Marshal and defied him to take
the musical instrument. Creed rushed
upon the woman and she lowered the
weapon and attempted to conceal it in her
dress, but while the Marshal held her se
curely Lemar obtained possession of the
weapon.
Mrs. Schioh was released and the officer
and expressman were set to work to move
the piano. After a short tnssel. during
which both pedals were broken off, it was
carried through the door and loaded upon
the express-wagon which had been
Drought along to cart it away.
The papers in the suit were served
against Mr. Schioh to-day. He said that
ne was sorry that Creed had received the
recep'ion he did at the hands of bis wife.
Schioh is a music-dealer in San Francisco.
Not long ago he went into insolvency and
this suit instituted through Attorney
Otto turn Suden is the sequel to the fail
ure. The case will be hearu before Justice
Bellrude in a few days.

unknown man was. found on the moun
tain side, half a mile from the Southern
Pacific track, by a sheepherder yesterday.
The Coroner held an inquest to-day and a
verdict of suicide was rendered. The de

old, and must have died months ago. He
was dressed in a coarse suit of woolen,
but little worn, and a heavy ulster, white
shirt and celluloid collar.'and cuffs, and on
his cuff buttons was the initial "E."
There was a bullet-hole in his lorehead
and a revolver with one empty chamber
lay by his side, In his pocket was found

dollar pieces, but nothing was found by
which he could be identified.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 26.â
Charles Etzler has lost the prestige he
once had as an accomplice of "Kid"
Thompson, the Roscoe train robber, by
coming down to a lower level of crime
and getting into jail on the charge of
stealing a horse and wagon. The jail
officials were well pleated to welcome him
as a prisoner, for he last figured as a
Southern Pacific detective and made him
self odious He was a. false friend to the
"Kd," for it was by his. evidence that
young Thompson was convicted. Officers
claim to have evidence against Etzier that
will send him to join the "Kid" In prison.

Conference Labors and
Athletic Contests
, Alternate.
Second Game of Baseball Is
Played by the Student
Delegates.
Missionary Topics Discussed by
Christian Leaders at the In
. door Meetings.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., May 26. -And
still they come the delegates to the Stu
dents' Conference, who were delayed by
examinations, class work or something
else inopportune. Ten arrived yesterday,
and started with fresh ardor upon the
work which those who preceded them have
begun. Some of the late-comers are of
athletic note and will probably "make
things lum" along that line before the
close of the convention. ***.
The usual instruction to the missionary
institute to-day was delivered by Robert
E. Lewis, wno talked about the enormous
influence the missionary bands of colleges
had upon the results of missionary field
work, on account of tba fact that : it was
from these bands the majority of men in
fo reign and home fields to-day came. Mr.
Lewis spoke of the manner of organizing
and maintaining these bands so that their
work would yield the very best results
toward fitting volunteers for the labors
before them.
The second hour of the morning session
was spent by the college delegates with C.
C. Michener in the west chapel of the M.
E. church. Mr. Michener continued bis
subject of Saturday morning, "Bible
Study," and the division of this morning's
lecture was "The Points to Be Empha
sized in the Successful Handling of the
Study of the Bible. The qualifications
for the teachers of this branch of dl-ege
study were spoken of at length.
"Don't talk about the importance of
Bible study," said Mr. Michener, "but live
its importance."
In answer to a question put by one of
tbe delegates Mr. Michener said that a
properly, prepared student was a much
better teacher of Bible clashes in college
than a professor who would teach it
merely intellectually. Let the members
oi tbe faculty train the leaders (students),
and let the leaders, train the classes, be
cause students can get nearer their fellow
students than a member of their faculty
could possibly.
At the same hour _'. L. Willis gave the
instruction to the assembled City associa
tion delegates in an informal class. His
lecture treated of the various phases of
work and problems which confront the
leaders of city associations and the man
ner in which the-e difficulties are to be
solved.
The afternoon athletic* included the
finish of the baseball tournament, In which
the winmr* of yesterday's match played a
picked nine from among the Stanford and
Berkeley delegates.
The game was a good one and well con
tested, the winners of yesterday's game
losing by a score of Bto 9. Reno Hutchin
son of Berkeley was curiam of the win
ning nine and Gifford of Stanford captain
of the others. : ";'.*. ' ; ... . > .'*' '*'*.'' , ',â'. V. ;, "
The tennis tournament was also con
tinued this afternoon and the semi-finals
of tbe singles reached. All of the games
were hotly contested.
The only evening session was the life
work class, which was opened to the pub
lic by courtesy of the committee of mana
gers. Rev. William Kipp of San Fran
cisco, who was to have addressed the
meeting, was unable to be present,
and Robert E. Lewis of Boston, secretary
of tbe students' volunteer movement, ad
dressed a -large assemblage of delegates
and others in the east chapel of the
Methodist Episcopal Church. The song
service which preceded the lecture was
conducted by F. L Willis, who also sang
the solo, "Lo. I Am With You."
Mr. Lewis talked of the call of God for
workers in the field of missionaries.
"It is considered a great thine," he
said, "to battle for a city or a country, but
how much greater a thing it is to battle
for the whole world."
MAY CHANGE THE LAMPS
A Proposition to Light the
Business Streets With
! Electricity.
Conference Between Supervisors, E ec
trie and Gas Men and the
Merchants' Association
The question of lighting the business
streets of this City by electricity instead
of gas was discussed at lenjtli at a con
ference held in tbe rooms of the Board of
Supervisors, and if the matter can bead
justed to the satisfaction of the lighting
companies the change will be made at an
early date.
Supervisor Rivera, chairman of th***
Street Lights Committee, and representa
tives of the Merchants': Association, elec
tric and gas companies were present, and
all expressed a desire to have the change
made. The light companies stated tb.-u
they were willing to tdo anything within
reason, but that it would cost a large sum
of money to make -the change, and that
they were not willing to say off-hand that
they would in the electric lights.
It wa? explained (hat it would be neces
sary to plug the gas pipes running to the
lamps, at the main, and that this would
involve a large amount of labor.
Messrs. Stow, King and Baldwin, who
appeared for the Merchants' Association,
stated , that if : . the / change , was made it
would vastly improve the appearance of
tbe business, streets and that the ad
ditional $10, 000 a year expense would be
more than justified by the change. Mr.
Baldwin stated â  that if the electric light
company would consent to lower the pr cc
of lights from 55 cents per night |to 49}_
cents per night the cost would be reduced
to about $4500 more than it is at present. 4
He said that the merchants would be
willing to stand the cost of lights between
corners if the City would pay for those at
crossings. ,He -thought .tnat -â¢ about 130
lights in addition to those already in
place would be sufficient for the; present.
The , electric-li. lit ' men ';-'.'â ' staled*". 'they'
would consult among themselves about
the proposition and let *tÂ»*e; merchants
know the result at an early date.
In case the answer is favorable the asso
ciation will ;. petition 1 -.*, the J Supervisors to
have the change made as soon as possible.
The streets to be improved by the new
style of lights include Market, Valencia,
Polk. Third, V Fourth, Fifth and Sixth
streets and other--. .j- Â -,

TOM SHARKEY WINS.
Relieved of the Obligation to Pay 8900
to Billy .Smith and George
: Allen. ~\-- .--
Judge Seawell handed down* an opinion
in . the case of Billy " Smith and George
Allen against Pugilist Tom Sharkey, in
which he decided that the plaintiffs have
no right to recover the $900 that they de
mand from the defendant for training him
for his tight with Fitz-nnimons. ' :y[ \
The claim was , assigned to J. J. Raver
for collection and he will be called on to
pay the costs of court. V ''';..
In deciding the case Judge Seawell re
viewed tne testimony, declaring â  that it
showed Smith and Alien to be engaged in
aiding and abetting a performance, that is
prohibited by law and. that is. made a
felony under the. statutes of California;
that persons furnishing such ' services
have no more legal standing in court than
an owner of real estate suing for rent of
premises which had been let by. him for
immoral purposes. ... , ';; .-*.-.
Replying to a suggestion in the brief of
the plaintiffs' counsel that some" relief
ought to be vouchsafed to persons who In
good faith did work for men who made
large gains in athletic exhibitions, Judge
Seawell said that creditors of this, kind
must rely on the honor of j their employers
unless they receive; their pay in advance;
that the courts could not help them in an
action of this character. - ,

The Retail Grocers' Protective Associa
tion met last night at B'nai , B'rith Halt

The view taken strongly by the grocers
is that the present law prohibiting the sate
of cigarettes to minors is duly observed
and is amply * sufficient for moral pur
poses. /They think, - moreover, that the
proposed change would work a great hard

GUMPEL'S
POCKETS
Attorney Foote Wrings an
Admission From the
Expert.
HOW HE WAS TO GIVE
TESTIMONY.
Extra Pay if His Opinion Be
Favorable to the Fair Es
tate's Executors.
WOULD GET $2000 TO DECOY
THE DEEDS.
This Witnrss Was Subjected to a Har
rowing Ordeal Yesterday While
Under .Cross-Examination.
Those who attended yesterday's cession
of the Fair-Craven trial cannot echo the
old complaint thai their greatest effort
was to keep awake.
It was without doubt the liveliest day
that this long-drawn-out proceeding has
yet experienced â made so primarily by
the cross-examination of Handwriting
Expert Gumpel and with numerous tiffs
and tussles between opposing counsel
thrown in to lend spice and zest to the
day's doings. The baiting of Gumpel by
Attorney W. W. Foote has been looked
forward to for days, for, being familiar
with the excitability of the expert when
under tire and likewise with the exasper
ating tenacity with which Mr. Foote
clings to a witness, everybody knew that
this particular act of the drama would
furnish something of more than ordinary
interest. And it did.
Gumpel did not emerge from the ordeal
in a blaze of glory. As has been the case
with him before when faced by a cross
examiner who knew his business, he lost
his head, stumbled and groped, and at
times contradicted himself alarmingly.
And then admissions were wrung from
him mat will doubtless supply the
groundwork for some scorching allusions
to his worth as an expert when the de
fense's arguments are reached at the close
of the trial. The most interesting of these
came out just before adjournment. Mr.
Louie was curious to know what the other
side was paying Gumpel for his services
in the case. The expert was inclined to
be evasive at first, and vouchsafed merely
that he bad a contract with the executors of
the estate. But, being pressed, he said he
was to get $3000 for his scrutinies of the
disputed will and deeds and for his opin
ion.
"And is that all?" asked Mr. Foote with
a peculiar smile. â¢"- ''>
"Well," said Gumpel, hesitatingly, "it
is also understood that if my opinion be
favorable to them I am to get more."
"Just what I was trying to get at," said
Mr. Foote triumphantly.
Counsel for tue estate objected stren
uously to the bringing out of his evidence,
but it availed them nothing.
"I have the right to show this witness'
interest in this case and why he is testify
ing here," was Mr. Foote's retort, "it is
pertinent that the jury should know that
this man is here for the puipose of filling
his pockets with lucre."
The court ruled the questioning on this
point to be proper, and Mr. Foote then
wrung the additional confession from
Gumpel that his extra allowance for giv
ing testimony favorable to the estate's
claims and -icainst Mrs. Craven will
amount to $2000.
During tne morning session Gumpel
denied that he pronounced the so-called
"pencil" will genuine at a time when the
Fair heirs were anxious to have : that
document probated in preference to the
"trust" will. The defense also desired
to question him regarding seme blunders
be is said to have made in other cases in
which he appeared as an expert, but the
court declined to admit the evidence.
Gumpel acknowledged that he had been
in frequent consultation with the other
experts employed in the case, but assured
the attorneys that he did not permit them
to influence him in forming his opinion.
Mr. Foote had a new piece of bait on his
hook for Gumpel when court reconvened
lor the afternoon session.
He handed the expert his court note
book, and, pointing to some writing on
one of the pages, asked him to diagnose it
and then state whether or not it had all
been written with the same pencil and all
at the same time.
This brought the entire line of attorneys
for the plaintiffs to their feet with a
chorus of protests. Mr. Mitchell declared
that evidence of this sort would open up
collateral issues and encumber the case.
Mr. McEnernev's rail was that the other
side had no right to trip up the expert
with catch questions, and Mr. Wheeler
said that all of the courts had ruled
against this style of testing a witness'
anility as an expert.
Judge Slack could see no .harm in the
question, however, as he deemed it simply
preliminary, anyhow. .
Gumpei, being directed to answer, said
that in his opinion Mr. Foote had written
those notes with one pencil and at the
same time.
"Now, yon are sure about that, are you â

you will swear to it?" asked Mr. Foote,
insinuatingly. â 'Ââ '
The attorneys on the other side were all
standing up again now with new protests.
Mr. Mitchell argued against the test once
more, and Mr. McEnerney quoted from
somebody on "the rules of expert evi
| dence." 'â â  â  ,
"Oh, let's not waste so much time,"
finally interrupted Mr. Foote. "I'll with
draw the book."
Counsel for the estate breathed a sigb
of relief at this and resumed their seats.
Gum pel when on direct examination
testified that Senator Fair never left the
letter "a" open at the top, as it am eared
to be .in the disputed deeds, and Mr.
Foote now reminded him of ; that . fact.
Gnmpel in reply said he still adhered to
that opinion. The attorney then handed
him a letter written by the dead million
aire in 1894. " '.."*'.
"Is the letter 'a' in Fair's ; signature to
that document open or closed?'' asked
Mr. Foote.
"It's open," replied Gumpel. .
"Then you will have to change your
opinion about Senator Fair's alleged
habit of writing closed 'as exclusively,
won't you?"
This was objected to by the other side
and the expert was Dot compelled to an
swer. He was, however, permitted to
demonstrate on the blackboard his theory
that even in writing an open "a" the Sen
ator used the same stroke and pen move
ment as he did in executing the closed
ones. ">*.*â¢ â
The capital letter "F" which begins the
word ."Fair" was next referred to by
Fooie, and the expert's attention called
to l_e fact that he had testified that the
letter was invariably written in two pieces
by Fair. A number of the deceased's let
era were then shown to him, in which
the "F" did not to all appeaiances bear
him out in his opinion.
Gumpel's explanation of this discrep
ancy took a new turn, being to the effect
that Fair really was addicted to seven dif
ferent habits relative to the execution of
the letter "F." At the request of counsel
he illustrated these varieties on the black
board. Bat in doing so he fell into a trap
and got quite a gruelling from the merci
less Foote before he got out of it. *.
It appears that he had already testified'
that in making his comparisons ol Fair's
writing he had rejected all letters or
"exemplars," as they are called in court,
that were not written around or about
the time the millionaire is sad â to have
written the "pencil" will and deeds. He
had said he could not form any opinion
from writings that had been executed
several years before 1894 But now, in
picking out those different habits of writ
ing the letter "F," he resorted to one
letter written as Jar back as 1880. "
"Didn't you swear that you could
not get along with writings unless they
were contemporaneous with the date of
the disputed documents?" asked Mr.
Foote. PP4HHBI
"Well, I didn't look at this letter be
fore," sputtered Gumpel, who was now
growing quite excited.
'Answer my question â didn't you swear
to that?"
"This letter was not â
"Didn't you swear to that, I say?" '.
"I don't remember â maybe I did."
"Don't you know you did?"
"I guess so."
"Well, then, what do you mean now by
making use of a letter ol 1880?"
Gumpel hesitated and then said that he
had only picked up this particular letter
! by accident.
This did not satisfy Mr. Foote, either,
and he wanted to know whether or not
I the expert had not assisted himself with
tuis letter to form a general opinion.
Gumpei's reply was that he had only
searched it for peculiarities in the let
ter "q."
"Then why didn't you tell us about
that before?" asked Mr. Foote.
"Because I thought you would ask me
j about it," replied Gumpel. "I can't re-
J member everything."
"Oh, you thought I would tumble to it,
', did you?"
Mr. McEnerney objected to Mr. Foote's
j tumbling propensities, and that gentle
! man's last question was stricken from the
record.
â  Before the letter "F" was dismissed, 1 the
plaintiff's attorneys were permitted to as-***
Gumpel a few questions the answers to
which would* tend to put him in a better
light Deiore the jury. But they only
served to make more trouble for him. He
was demonstrating again with the capital
"F" on the blackboard, when Juuge Den
son of the defense's line suddenly broke
in with a declaration that GuniDel was
purposely exaggerating certain character
istics of Fair's writing for the purpose of
bolstering his own evidence.
"This witness is resorting to a trick to
deceive the jury," "said Judge D.-nson
warmly in conclusion.
This charge was objected to and charac
terized by Mr Wheeler as "misconduct,"
but the court permitted it to stand.
Judge Denson then stepped up to the
blackboard and pointed out the exaggera
tions he had referred to for the benefit of
the jury.
Mr. Foote also called attention to an
"F" that Gumpel had drawn on the board
in imitation of the one appearing in the
signature to the will. He wanted to know
if it was a correct reproduction, and Gum
pel said it was.
"Now you have testified here that the
signature to the will possesses no lite or
characteristics," said Mr. Foote. "Don't
you know as a matter of fact that that
'F' on the board is the liveliest one of the
whole band you have drawn?"/
Gumpel , admitted that it was pretty
lively, but said that liveliness in & writing
did not show "life." 'Â
" Well, is that 'F' alive or dead?" per
sisted the attorney.
"It's neither," said the expert.
"As a matter of fact it's a good, lively
fat letter, now isn't it?"'
"It's fat enough," said Gumpel, "but it
has no life." ~
The expert was released after this, but
there is some more of the witness-stand in
store for.him to-day. .

A Special Entertainment for the
Grown Peoplj Will ; Be Held

Everything is progressing favorably for
the local celebration of the first Lincoln
day, which will be held in this City to
morrow. In the afternoon over sixty
veterans, members of the Grand Army
posts, will visit the public schools and
take part in the exercises. The exercises

An outline of these several features was
given last evening at a special meeting of
the President Lincoln Monument League
that met in B'nai B'rith Hall on Eddy
street.
Treasurer C. Mason Kinne reported that
$1031 has come to his hands for the erec
tion of a monument to the memory of the
martyred President.
Besides hi.-, the quartermaster holds $300
more, and a large . sum is now in the
band* of the officials of the School De
partment. All this snows that the people
are united in this one purpose.
President W. W. Stone statad that the
Superintendent of Schools has taken an
earnest interest in the movement, for on
Tuesday be issued the following notice to
the principals and teachers: â¢
Ladies and Gentlemen: The edition of The

Temple, on Filth street, near Marker, Monday
morning. May 31,' from 8:30 to 9:30 by the

movement in the Empire State. Yours very
respectfully, . Charles R. Skinner, ..

OFFICER ROBL JUSTIFIED.
| He Did Not Make Any â  Change In the
| - Casaino Warrant.
i Policeman F. W. Robl has apparently
been made to suffer for the laches of an
other. He served a warrant for Manuel
Cassino, wanted for betrayal, upon Manuel
Casm, the erstwhile Central American
politician. Then he ; was suspected %of
having changed, the. warrant, so as to co
incide with the name cf the man arrested.'
But it appears; that ; Robl; was not! to
blame. Casin was ".pointed out to him as
Cassino and when the arrest had been
made it was â *â  Prison-keeper â  'Olen*. of the
California-street station' who in good faith
made the name on the warrant correspond
with the name given Iby the prisoner. It
was a comedy of errors all round and as
the name on the warrant was miserab y
indited the mistake : was a natural one,
reflecting no discredit on Robl or OlenJ ;

PUPILS TO HONOR
BUNKER HILL DAY
Exercises Will Be Held
on the Morning of
June 17.
School Director Head Wants
Teachers' Back Salaries
Paid. ;
Estimate of the Amount N*ede_ for
the Department Submitted at
Last Night's Meeting.
The Board of Education decided last
evening to recognize Bunker Hill day
with more than the ordinary mark of re
spect. Superintendent of Schools Webster '
introduced the following resolution, that
was unanimously adopted: v !
Resolved. That In addition to the raising of
flags, as provided lor in section 126 of the
rules, teachers devote the first fifteen minutes
of the mor ling session on June 17 Bunker
Hill day â to . such exercises as* will appropri
ately commemorate that important historical
event in the American Revolutionâ the battle
of Bunker Hill.
Chairman Waller of the Finance Com
mittee submitted a report in which he
recommended that the May salary de
mands of teachers be given them in spite
of the deficit that confronts the depart
ment. ' â 
Director Head offered a substitute
strongly urging that the half month's sal
ary of the teachers that was held out in
November last be paid them immediately.
He quoted figures from the Treasurer
showing that the money was on hand,
and declared it was an outrage, as long as
the department had the money on hand,
to deprive the teachers of their just dues.
Director Waller raised a point of order
that was sustained by the president, and
the committee's report was adopted.
An estimate of the appropriation that
will be asked at the hands of . the Super
visors for the next fiscal year was submit
ted by Director Waller. It calls for $2,
--021,458 87, distributed as follows: Teachers'
salaries, $962,080 87; teachers' unpaid sal
aries for 1896-97. $115,500; janitors' sala
ries, $54,424 85 ; suDpliei, books, station
ery, repairs, $334,45315; permanent im
provements, $555,000.
The appropriation allowed for last year
was $1,200,000, to which was added '*. a bal
ance ol $11,000, carried over from th**- pre
vious year. ( There will be a deficit of
$130,000 or more. The estimate was ac-
cepted.
The Committee on Health reported that
during the month past the eyes of 1035
children had been examined with the fol
lowing result:
Five hundred and sixty with normal vision,
61 shortsighted, 228 farsighted, 186 stig
ma tic, 5 cros-eyed. 4 wall-eyed. 8 color blind.
Among the 475 with defective sight, 53 are
provided with proper correcting glasses.
The City Board of Examiners made the
following recommendations:
R.H. Webster to be recommended to the
State Board for a diploma of the high-school
grade, and Mrs. Louise B. Deal, .Miss Margaret
F. Ha ussier. Miss Harriett E. Rademaker and
Miss Flora Van den Bergh for life diplomas of
the grammar grade; Mies Evelyn L. sheppard
granted a high-school certificate; Miss Kate
D. Spedding and Miss Tessie O'Farreli granted
grammar-grade certificates; high-school cer
tificates renewed for Miss Ada M. Goldsmith,
El Is ha Brooks and Charles H. Ham;primary
grade certificates renewed for Miss Emily M.
Goggin and Miss Mary H. Slavan. There be-'
ing but eight members present the report was
laid over one week.
The Committee on Buildings and
Grounds reported in favor of purchasing
a lot for a school building to be located
west of Baker street and north of Fell
street, as asked for by the Panhandle and
Ashbury Heights Improvement Club.
Also that a four-class school- building be
erected on De . Haro street, near Solano.
The report was adopted.
. The positions of teachers of drawin g in
the School Department, how held by
Miss Katherine M. Ball and Mrs. E. P.
Bradley, were declared vacant, the action
to take effect on June 1. This action was
taken on the ground that the teachers are
not necessary for the conduct of the de
partment and that there is no law for the
payment of tneir salaries.
An attempt was made to remit a fine
imposed on Miss P. M. Nolan for. failing
to send in her regular report on time, but
the measure failed io pass by one vote.
Recommendations of the Committee on
Classification were adopted as fellows :
A new class to be formed in the Everett
Grammar School, Miss M. E. Devine assigned
to the Everett Grammar School; a new class
to be formed in the James Licit Grammar
School, Mrs. M. L. Brown to be transferred
from the' Franklin Grammar; School to the
James Lick School; Miss Edna Cttdwalader as-'
signed as probationary teacher in the Frank
lin Grammar School, Miss L. V. : Morgan as
signed as a probationary teacher in the Fair
mount School; that the study of humane
education bo introduced and made a regular
course in the schools .without extra expense
to the department.
Superintendent Webster was instructed
to carry out the provisions of the medal
trusts, by. which Messrs. Bridge and Dan
man provided $4000 for the purpose of
giving rewards for meritorious work in
their classes. "â "..- - . '
"Soclely "
The curron tif sue of "Society? Is especially
attractive. It contains a supplemental por
trait of ClauÃ Spreckels as No. 1 of a series
representing "The '; Fortune-builders of Cali
fornia." There is also a variety ol other meri
torious pictures. Perhaps the most fuscinat
ing is a vignette on the first page of Miss Laura
Leigh Gashwiler, whose engagement to ' Sa
muel M. Shortridere has -> recently been an
nounced. The work on this portrait is Ito all
appearances T perfect, the bright, frank face,
with its Intelligent expression, constituting a
notable i ornament to the ; page. * Other por
traits are : ,*,, President * David Starr Jordan,
Mme. Barrios, Mayor Pheian, who contributes
a special article; Professor Lowe and Mrs. Sey
mour. The typographical - work iis f particu
larly, creditable, and the department of adver
tising is attractively managed.;; The whole is
comprised in an artistically tinted cover of

THE TEA DUTY.
The argument with which Sena or Aid
rich s*pport:d the proposed duty on ea
in open ng the debate on the tariff was by
no means so strong as that with which be
maintained other features of the meas
ure. It advanc-d nothing which Is in the
least likely to change public opinio-! on
the sulkj ct and popular opposition to the
duty will remain as determined as ever.
The argument of ('the' Senator is that the
Government needs revenue, and that a
bill which' should rearrange the tariff
without providing an adequate revenue
would be disrsrous to the party enacting
it as well as being prejudicial to the wel
fare of the Nation. Continuing he said:
Assuming that the necessity for additional
revenue exists, and of this we believe there can
be no question, there. Is no economic reason,
and certainly none that effects the public in
terest, why beer and tobacco should not bear
their share of additional taxation. The com
mittee believe 'hat the duty proposed on tea
will not prove a serious burden uj on the con
sumers of that article.
No man will lightly disagree on tariff
questions with so eminent an expert as
Senator Aldrich, but, nevertheless, on this
particular statement a great 'many will
disagree with him. There are good eco
nomic reasons and tome materially affect
ing the public welfare why additional rev
enues should not be sought by imposing
the proposed taxes. The Senate tariff bi 1
does not reach by any means the limit ol
revenues which could be raised by duties
on foreign imports. The duties could be
advantageously increased on prune?, rai
sins, wines wool and olive oil On all
these the Senate duties are lower than
the fixed by the House. Why not re
store the House duties?
There can be no question that it is the
duty of every Western Senator to oppose
the duty on tea. Until Western indus
tries have been given the full amount of
protection needed there is no reason why
any non-protective duties should be levied.
Protection and revenue can be made to go
hand in hand. It has been the policy of
the Republican party in the past to ar
range tariffs on that principle, and there
is no reason why the policy should now
be set aside. The duty on tea is a tax on
the poor from which there is no escape
and for which there is no necessity. It
should be rejected and protective duties
substituted in place of it.
PRANK M'COPPIN.
By the death of Postmaster McCoppin
San Francisco loses anotner of those citi
zens **ho are associated with the early
days of her history and whose energies
have been directed to the public service
with distinguished success. His death
will be felt therefore as a loss to the com
munity at large, and his friends and rela
tives will have abundant popular sympa
thy in their sorrow.
Mr. McCoppin came to San Francisco in
1859 and almost immediately took a prom
inent part in municipal politics. He was
elected Supervisor when but 26 years of
age and fulfilled the duties of that office
with so much satisfaction to the people
that be was re-elected again and again.
In 1867 he was chosen Mayor, and here
again he proved himself worthy of the
confidence of the people. His adminis
tration was progressive and was marked
by the beginning o: Golden Gate Park, a
fact which in itself is sufficient to retain for
him a high place in the memory of his
fellow-citizens and in the history of the
City. _"â¢;..,.
Passing from municipal to State poli
tics Mr. McCoppin served as State Senator
and was identified with the adoption of
many legislative measures of great impor
tance to the commonwealth. In later
years he held many Federal appoint
ments, and in all of them fulfilled the du
ties imposed upon him with credit to
himself and with benefit to the Govern
ment. His public career was in fact of a
high standard throughout and the record
be has left is one of which any citizen
might be proud. >
American communities n?eJ such men
as Frank McCoppin. In these days, when
so many citizens of standing and repute
shirk their public duties, it is no light
thing to lose a man who was ever ready to
serve the public as diligently as he served
bis individual interests. In his character
civic patriotism and public spirit were
strongly developed and the community as
a whole has reason to mourn his death.
THE BATE WAR.
The imminence of a rate war between
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
on one band and the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company on the other will
cause no ill-boding on the part of the good
people of California.
Although war, as a general thing, means
a condition which, whether accompanied
by glory or fraught with humiliation, is
to be deplored in the causes which
engender it, still the rule has exceptions
wherein war becomes "a consummation
devoutly to be wished.'* One of these ex
ceptions is a war of competing railway
and steamship lines. As a general rule
the cost of wars is drawn from the pockets
of the people, but in . the - particular
instance to which we refer the result is
equivalent to a popular saving, and, in
fact, the more rate wars we have, as be
tween these antagonistic corporations, the
better pleased will be the public at large.
, Just at this time a slashing of trans
portation rates between this City and the
Oregon metropolis would mean an im
mense increase in travel, and such being
the case, California, with her innumerable
attractions, would naturally command the
biggest share of the resultant benefits. We
are slowly and surely working our way
out of the years of tight money which
have bad their retarding effect on travel ;
and there are people all over the country,
east and north of us,, who would now
eagerly take advantage of . extremely low
rates to enjoy a short season of recreation
and pleasure in the midst of matchless
scenery in our fidenic climate. Â£
If the rate war comes, there will be no
tears shed on the part of the people i! it
should widen and extend. Let the broad
swords of the railroad- and;*; steamship
gladiators clash on each other's shieldsâ it
will be a welcome conflict, and the
thousands will be likely to get their
money's-worth of â â  inspiriting diversion
while the battle proceeds. â¢ It would * be
well if the rate war should keep up and
grow continuously more intense all sum
mer; and nobody would raise a staying
hand if the- war were to be fought in
definitely on the same lines:?!; â  X'yJ'ty X.
ALVISO! HARBOR.
The mass-meeting held in San Jose on
Tuesday evening to advance the improve
ment of Alviso harbor wat rendered im
pressive ,: by the enthusiasm of the assem
bly and by the force and vigor of the reso
lutions adopted. Both of - these features
are significant of the earnestness with
which the people of the county have en
tered ; upon : the work of pushing"' forward
the enterprise, . and ; taken together they
give promise of good results in the near
future. /
: The tone of the resolutions shows the
sentiment of the people. Those officials
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 27, 1897.
who have aided the work are commended,
and those who have thwarted it are not
left in doubt as to the feeling of the com
munity in r.-gard to them. Tne meeting
evidently believed the time has come to
make a strai.htout fight for the . improve
ment, and was not disponed to deal in:
vague generalities. Every declaration
from the preamble to the closing resolve
was terse, timely and telling. It was an
emphatic notice given that the people of
Santa Clara County are determined to win
in this contest, and that all who; are not
for them will be accounted as against
them.
The movement is one in which Santa
Clara should have the cordial support of
the whole State. Csrtainly all the com
munities around the bay should give her
prompt and vigorous help. The proposed
improvement will be a benefit to nil our
coasting commerce. ÂIt will open to our
shipping another rich region, and by
building up the industries of the southern
end of the bay materially advance every
interest which is dependent. for expansion
upon an increase of population, wealth
and trade. *"â â¢â¢â ". '(-_â '.
The resolute way in which the people
of Santa Clara have set about their agita
tion for the speedy beginning of the enter
prise is in itself an argument in their
favor. When men' help themselves they
deserve help from others. The; entire
California delegation in Congress should
make a strong fight for an appropriation
for the improvement. The cost will be
little and the benefits great.
THE HALL OF JUSTICE
The continued failure of the contractors
to push work on the Hall of Justice, is
aggravating in the extreme. Their is
an army of idle men in the City,
all praying for an opportunity to labor for
daily bread for themselves and their fam
ilies. At any time during the past three
months these contractors could have
started operations which would have
given work to a large number of the un
employed. Instead of thU, we have the
spectacle of an ornamental superintendent
of construction strutting up and down
the bare site for exercise once in a while,
and drawing the fat salary of $250, while at
the same time the contractors have been
persistently holding back from their agree
ment to show proper diligence in carry
ing out the terms of their contract.
We trust that the Building Committee
of the Board of Supervisors will now
demonstrate that it possesses backbone
enough to rigidly enforce the letter of the
contract in accordance with their determ
ination as reported in yesterday's papers.
As the matter now stands the contract
ors fac*Â» the alternative of beginning work
on the building at once or seeing it done,
independent of them, under the supervi
sion of the architect, and at their expense.
We may now undoubtedly be assured of
progress in the premises. There is abso
lutely no substantial reason why the Hall
of Justice should not have been in process
of construction long ago. The property
holders and business men of the hail-site
vicinity have voiced their indignation on
several occasions with regard to this delay,
which is working injury to their business
and property. The City, moreover, is in
positive need of the building. It behooves
the Building Committee to stand firmly
by its action of Tuesday and to tolerate no
more dilly-dallying by the contractors. It
is even said that the latter do not take the
action of thÂ« committee seriously. It re
mains for the committee to teach them
that it can keep its resolution. As notice
has already been served on the head of
the contracting firm that any further de
lay will cause the architect to assume
charge we look for the commencement of
work straightway. The Building Com
mittee has done well in so far as its an
nounced resolution is concerned. We are
eager to see it carry out that resolu
tion. If there is more delay the sin
cerity of the board may be called into
question, as well as that of the con
tractors. '

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Krances Saville (Fanny Simondson), tre Cali
fornia prima" donna,, who sang at the Metro
politan^he season before last, has been flirt
ing with Victor Maurel to such an extent that
her Jealous husband has broucht the thing
Into the courts. Mine. Saville,, who. is very,
pretty, was born in California, but "brought up
in Australia, and most of her success has been
achieved in Paris. As for Maurel, who is payi
ng the name role in "Don Juan" at the Paris
Opera, he prides himself upon being as great a
masher in private life as the hero whose part
he enacts. The Musical Courier tells that
when Maurel was in St. Louis three or four
years ago he wrote letters to three members of
the Grau company, and the ladies, patterning
alter the Merry Wives of Windsor, resolved to
hive some fun with the Sir John Falstaff of
Paris. They compared notes and an appoint
ment was made by one of them, who signified
in her note that she whs madly in love. He
hastened to the assignation with shoes aflame

and heart smoking with love. He met cot one
but three, and the laughter must have been
tantalizing.}* superb. Maurel took the joke
good-naturedly and gave a luncheon that was
a delight. But he trod on more serious ground
with Mme. Saville, who happened to be im
pressionable, and whose husband, Max P.awn,
happened to be jealous. Frances sought for a
divorce from Max in Paris, and he has insti
tuted a counter-suit, so Victor Maurel is apt to
have a lively time, lor a divorce in Paris is a
serious matter. . '. ,1
The new Zola-Bruneau opera, "Messldor,"
which tells an almost brutally realistic story
of the lives of the poor, was little short of a
fiasco when produced three months ago before
a rich and fashionable' crowd at the Paris
Grand Opera. Bui Zola has had his revenge,
and this is how it came about: The Grand
Opera is a Government theater and twice a
year it gives a gratuitous performance to the
people of Paris who cannot afford to pay. On
the last occasion the Opera kept open house*
the management decided to produce "Messl
dor." "It was very interesting," says Le Fi
garo, "to see how the great anonymous public,
made up of nobodies, received this much-iis
cussed work, the action of which j passes
among humble people, and which sings the
song of the triumph of labor. The perform
ance was a long success. We all know the
packed houses of gratuitous nights, the de
light of the poor at finding themselves in
luxurious boxes, the freshness of impressions,
which takes the form of intense attention, or
loud applause. Never was work followed with
a more touchingly naive Interest than 'Messi
dor' last night, for the masses recognized in it
their own heart and soul. The legend of the
gold, the song of the reaper and the shep
herd's adieu aroused a storm oi applause, and
It must be added that the. artists sang as if
they had been performing before a parterre of
kings. 'Mebsidor' has received the baptism of
the masses."
The "Jubilee" prima donna is expected ;to
do as she is told, at least that is the news that
comes from London, where the newly opened
opera season promises to be a brilliant one.
The opera syndicate, of which Lady de Gray is
the power behind the throne, is managing
everything, and neither Maurice Grau nor
any other manager Is now master of Coven t
Garden. Grau is only one, though the chief
and; most trusted, who will work under the
general control of the committee. The broad
outlines of the enterprise, the choice of novel
ties and the selectiou and salaries of the
operatic company were settled before Grau ar
rived on the scene at all. The day-to-day de
tails behind the curtain arc left to be worked
oui by him, with the committee to turn to for
advice, if requisite, and without unnecessary
interference on their part. The committee of
the syndicate has decided not to grant "ex
clusive" or "first appearance" rights to any
prima donna, and, in short, the discipline es
tablished is such that the committee expects
to have a free hand. A little of that sort of
thing on this side of r the Atlantic would have
saved an immense amount of wrangling at the
Metropolitan Opera-house last winter. ,'

organizations he said that tho amount of good
they have done is incalculable; that they hi. vo
saved thousands of families from the eieeino
synary institutions, and had kept down taxa
tion by preventing pauperism aud crime, and
in that way saved the 'expenditure of largo
sums of public money for ihe erection or en
largement of ; almshouses, ho-pltals and pris

ants. The world, he said, it had been stated,

THE cUbAN PROBLEM.
Spain is not likely to do willingly anything
in regard to Cuba that the people of this coun
try think ought to he done. She has made of
that island the most wretched spot on earth.â
Hartford Times. ,*.: -
The American people will eagerly await the
return of Special Commissioner Calhoun, and
it is safe to assume that the present adminis
tration will not attempt to suppress the truth
about Cuba.â Syracuse Post.
The people are growing impatient, they have
listened so long. They want to see this Gov
ernment recognize the belligerent rights of
the Cubans and speaK the brave word which
shall make Cuba free.â Chicago Tribune.
We do not look for war. That seems out of
the question. We do believe that something

The sending of relief to distressed Ameri
cans must produce developments. It, is pre
dicted In circles believed to be well informed

ginning of the end of Spanish rule and mis
rule in Cuba will have dawned.â Utica Herald.
In our view the President's immediate pro
ject, that of sending aid to the distressed and
starving Americans on the island, so far from
being an effort to divert the Cuban problem
from a proper solution by raising a new issue
really snows his desire to begin upon that solu
tion.âNew York Sun.
The cry of the hungry and the moan of the
fever stricken in Cuba have been heard in
Washington, and the machinery of Govern
ment has been started to afford relief. Now it
must come at whatever price, even to the cut
ting short of Spain's ignoble rule In the An
tilles.âBaltimore Herald. :
The duty of the Government Is to see that its
navy is ready for active and prompt measures,
and that it has the means at hand for speedily
mobilizing an adequate military force. lhese
provisions made, it should at once take what
ever steps will lead straightest to the goal of
peace and freedom for Cuba. 'â '". '"...-J- jJyyJJr
.... The fact that Spain cannot conquer the
Cuban rebellion has been demonstrated be
yond reasonable dispute, and any intervention
on the par: of our Government that may
hasten the inevitable solution of the problem
would be as much an act of humanity as ol
statesmanship.â Philadelphia "Times.
We have taken no part in the trouble, and
permitted atrocities that are too horrible to
contemplate with patience. The time is ap
proaching when we must do our duty, hut we
rely on the President, with his appreciation of
responsibility, his patriotism anu wisdom, to
decide upon a course, confident that when a
conclusion has been reached he [will not hesi
tate, but do what is required.â

tie Spectators
The National Athletic Club gave an ex
cellent fistic entertainment la3t evening
in Woodward's Pavilion.
After Charley Rochette and "Yank"
Savage had sparred for a few rounds the
second event, which was a ten-round con
test between W. S. Johns, alias Billy El
mer, and Jim Ryan of New York came on.
Hiram Cook officiated as referee.
Elmer was very nervous and backed
away from Ryan until the latter had him
up against the ropes. Ryan tried several
righthand swings, but most of them fell
short.
In the third round Elmer did better and
warmed Ryan's face with some stiff left
handers. Ryan relied altogether on a
right swing to win the battle.
The fourth round was interesting. Ryan
landed a heavy left-hand swing on Elmer's
neck, but the pugilist-actor came back
with one or two jabs that caused Ryan to
look wise. .
Ryan rushed the sixth round, but got
the worst of the mix-up. Elmer staggered
him with a right swing, which raised a
small thanty over Ryan's left eye. The
crowd, and especially the theatrical push,
shouted hard for Elmer.
In the seventh round Elmer forced the
pace and jabbed Ryan with left-handers
in the face. Ryan swung right and left,
tut the blows *.-ither fell snort or landed
on the back of Eimer's head. Ryan was
doubled up from the effects of a hard left
in the stomach. Near the end of the
round Ryan sot borne a few good left
swings on Elmer's necK, but the receiver
d.d no. appear to notice them.
The eighth round was quite interesting.
Ryan fought wicked and tried hard to put
Elmer out. The actor caught two or three
stiff punches in the jaw, which took con
siderable steam out of him. At one time
Ryan bit a bit low and Elmer appealed to
the referee, who signaled the lighters on
to battle. Elmer was on the retreat when
the gong sounded.
Elmer looked pretty well tired out
when be toed the scratch for the ninth
round.
Ryan sailed in to finish him and stag
gered Elmer against the ropes with a
right swing on the jaw, but the actor
pugilist came back and stood his ground
until the gong sounded the men to cor
ners. Elmer was weak and Ryan was
strong at the finish.
The last round was the most interesting
of all. Elmer cut out a hot pace and
landed repeatedly with the left on Ryan's
fac.*-. The latter missed several swings.
Hiram Cook read off his decision by
rounds, which ended in iavor of Ryan.
The decision was received by the spec
tators with hoots and cat-calls, and Elmer
received a great ovation as he left the ring
lor his dressing-room. A draw would
have been well received.
In the twenty-round contest, which was
the event of the evening, George Green
was the first to enter the ring, accompan
ied by his. seconds, Frank Foster, - Eddie
Graney and Bob McArthur.
Charley McKeever followed shortly af
terwards, accompanied by "Spider" Kelly,
Mike Cooney and Harry Jones.
After the usual preliminaries, such as
tossing for corners, fitting and examining
the gloves, and so, on, the geng was
sounded lor the fight to begin.
The announcer stated that the men had
agreed that in the event of both being on
their feet at the end of the twentieth
round the battle should be declared a
draw.
First roundâ Lively :. fiddling and a rapid
exchange of blows followed. Green played for,
McKeever's stomach and landed several times,
alternating by planting hit left on Me's nose.

Green's part was very fast.

characterized this round. Both were fighting
hard and. strong. McKeever's leit eye was
bleeding and Green had a cut on- his nose.

a swing at the head, and caught a hard smash
on jaw in re. urn. A rapid exchange of rights

Eleventh round â McKeever looked the
fresher man of the two when the .round
opened. Green went at him with a rush and
landed a hard right. It was give and take
until near the close of the ' round, when Green
called the attention of the referee to a low
blow. He said, 'What do you call that?''

Twelfth roundâ Green swings wild and gets

stomach and lands a return on the bead. Fast
infighting, mostly body blows. Both very
weak. Green forces the fighting, and Mc-
Keever has to clinch to save himself as the
gong sounds.
Thirteenth roundâ Both pugilists were very
tired when time was called. McKeaver cut
out the pace and planted some hot rights and
lefts on Green's neck, but George came back
with body blows that made red the side of his
opponent. It was give and take to the end of

Fourteenth roundâ They came up lively and
started right at it; both landing stiff body
punches. They exchange left jabs on the

gets a left on the nose in return. Green lands
terrific left swing on jaw and had McKeever
very groggy. McKeever had to clinch to save
himself. Green tried to finish him but could
not land on a vulnerable spot.
Fifteenth roundâ Green under instructions
from his seconds rushed his game hard. He
'missed a left swing; but in went his heavy
I right under McKeever's -eft arm. It was a
hard â  blow which made the receiver double
up life a jack knife. Quick as a
hash Green sent his left glove bang
on McKeever's mouth and the receiver stag
gered back against the ropes. Mac was dying
hard. Game as a chicken he rallied and
smashed wildly with right and left, hop
ing "-that*: a chance blow would land
on the* point of his 'opponent's
tew, but Green, backed away until Mc-
Keever's fists stopped cleaving the air; then
he rushed in again and smashed the invader
a hard right on that sore spot under the :â  left
arm. McKeever's guard dropped, and quicker
than a flash Green's left fist landed hard
on the jaw. The receiver staggered and as tie
fell against the ropes Green ripped him again
with a right on the body ana a lett on the jiw.
Mc, game as game could be, dropped to the
floor with the palm of his left glove placed
over the red spot that flushed his ribs. His
j head hung low, but as he was about to ' rise,
| after being down six seconds, Referee Cook or
dered Green to his corner and declared the
j match ended. Cook then gave his decision in
; favor of Green, which was received with good
grace.
McKeever might have stood another
round, but the referee showed excellent
judgment in stopping the fight when he
thought that one of the contestants had
had enough of the game and was clearly
a beaten man. 'T^-fflHMSrfBFtWj
All in all it was one of i the most scien
tific and best exhibitions witnessed in
this City for some time, and McKeever,
although defeated, is one of the best
welter-weights of the day. His sides must
be very sore, as he received terrible pun
ishment. The same blows whipped Mys
terious Billy Smith at Carson.
OBJECT TO THE WAGONS.
Fruit-Dealers Want Peddlers Prohib
ited From Holding Their stands
on the Streets. .
A committee of fruit-dealers called on
the License Committee of the Board of
Supervisors yesterday to protest against
the custom of -allowing fruit-peddlers'
wagons to stand on the streets, . .
The spokesman stated that it was greatly
injuring the business of the dealers, who
pay tent, employ help and contribute to
the City finances in the way of licenses
and taxes.
It was stated that in some instances
dealers had been driven out of business
by competition of this kind, for the reason
that they could not, because of their
heavier expenses, equal the prices at which'
the pc idlers sell. ", .
Â« The Supervisors agreed that this was a
bad state of affairs and decided to recom
mend that the | board call on the Chief of
Police to prevent the wagons from stand
ing on the streets.
The dealers then called on the Mayor
and asked him to grant no further permits
for fruitstands and wagons. .* -.' y J.
Mr. Phelan agreed to look into the mat
ter and asked the dealers to submit a list
of the locations of the wagons and stands
to which objection is made.

TO TAKE CORN TO
INDIA'S STARVING
The City of Everett Has
Bsen Engaged for the
Mission.
Improvement of the Schooner
Excelsior for the Alaska ,
Trade.
The General FaircMld Will Give an
Illustration of "Carrying Coal
to Newca.tle."
â¢ The renovated and rebuilt steam
schooner Excelsior is almost ready for
sea again. She will go from here to
Alaska and will engage in the passenger
business. The forward part of the ship
has been decked over and cabin accommo
dations provided for those who wilt pat
ronize the vessel on the Yukon and be
ween the various trading stations of the
Alaska Commercial Company. When the
! alterations were half completed the Ex
| celsior looked more like a whalebuck than
I anything, else, but now that ,the deck
houses have been put on Louis Sloss Jr.
| asserts that she looks like an ocean liner.
One thing is certainâ the alterations have
not impaired but rather improved the
looks of the Excelsior.
There was a peculiar condition of af
fairs on the -water front yesterday. The
General Fairchild went alongside' the
Dirigo to take on board coal for Nanaimo,
B. C. The "black diamonds" came from
the Cumberland coal mines via New York
and they are known as 'â¢blacksmith coal."
The explanation is this: The General
Fairchild wants ballast and they want
blacksmiths' coal in Alaska as well as
British Columbia coal. Consequently, as
the General Fairchild' would have had to
go from here in ballast, it was cheaper to
take the coal from the Dirigo and tinish
the loading at Nanaimo.
The owners of the wbaleback City of
Everett have accepted the Government's
offer of $40,000 to carry the United States'
offering of cereals to the starving native**.
of India to Calcutta The steamer will go
on the drydock for a thorough overhaul
ing, after which she will proceed to the
Nevada dock, where .the wheat, corn and
barley, has been stored to await tranship
ment. About 2500 tons will be put into
the steamer's holds, and that will allow
sufficient space for coal enough to carry
her to Calcutta. The City of Everett will
about pay expenses out of her charter, the
United States treasury will be out $40,000,
aud good corn and wheat that could have
been used to feed the starving poor of San
Francisco will go through the Golden Gate
to feed the starving poor of India.
Details of the wreck of the schooner
Theresa have been received from Captain
J. F. Ryan of the North American Com-,
mercial Company. The vessel was trans
porting stores from Wood Island to Coal
Bay in Alaska. % She was at anchor on the
night of April 16 when a terrific gale
sprang up. r Both anchors were out, but
did not hold, and the captain attempted
to put to sea. The jib and mainsail car
ried away, the vessel was nearly swamped,
and in order to save the lives of. those on
board the Theresa was put broadside on
the beach, where _; she - became a total
wreck. '; No lives were lost. Among those
on board we re., W. J. Fisher, aeent of the
North American Commercial ~ Company,
Hunters Peter Moller and;: Martin Larsen
and a number of natives. The wreck was
afterward stripped and the hull sold at
Wood Island for $13.
THE BATE WAR UNCHANGED.
Likely the Oregon Railway and Naviga
tion Company 'Will Make a Cut.
No further cuts in the Portland rate war
are yet reported.'. The ', Southern '. Pacific
rates to Portland are $15 first class and $10
second class.; The steamer rates are $10
first class.
;;. City Agent Conner denies that his com
pany has red need rales to $8 cabin and $4
steerage. He thought it quite likely that
the Southern Pacific cut would :be met,
but had not been so informed.
It is now generally believed in commer
cial circles that the 1 war has only begun
and that cuts will be made 'than last year.
The affair is likely to be fought out to the
bitter end. ; .'*-â¢â 'â -;- â *"â "'..-." >â¢'â  â -â â  â â  ;- â *â '-."â  ;;â :-*,.*

CLAUS SPRECKELS
WILL HELP OUT
His Liberal Off ar to Major
Winchell and the
Committee.
Will Furnish Some Excellent
Land for Profitable Beet
Culture.
Co onists by Industry and Thrift May
- Win Happy Homes in a Very
Few Years.
Major Winchell of the Salvation Army
is still busy with the colonization project.
Alter many weeks of hard work and in
quiry and "trying out" of men he sees
success shining ahead of his efforts
through the enterprise and public spirit
of Claus Spreckels. V -j "':'-: ''
Yesterday the major, in company with
ex-Mayor Ellert William M. Bunker,
visited Mr. Spreckels, and had a long talk
with him regarding the" colonization
scheme. MajorWlnch ell explained how the
Citizens' Colonization Committee proposed
to raise money to start the colonists going.
Mr. Sprec_els informed his visitors that
there were two large tracts of sugar-beet
land available for the colony. One was
GOOO acres in area, but had not been sub
divided. There was another tract of 600
acres tied up in the Probate Court in Mon
terey County which would soon be re
leased and which could be secured for the
colonists. Mr. Spreckels offered to ie it
for one year as much of the tract of 600
acres as might be required for the colonists
at 6 per cent upon a valuation of |60 an
acre. At the end of the year if t c col
onists should prove to be industrious he
would sell the land to them at what it
co* t him and would give them easy terms
for payment.
The land is near Soled ad and is well
adapted for the raising of sugar beets. Mr.
Spreckels will pay the colonists $4 per ton
for ail the beets they can raise, and as the
land in question, with proper cultivation,
will produce from fifteen to twenty tons
to the acre, it can be seen at a glance that
the colonists will have a rare opportunity
to own their own homes and to be
thoroughly independent within a very few
years. -_ .
The committee expressed themselves as
well pleased with the prospects and the
very liberal offer of Mr. Spreckels, and
will make it the leading subject of discus
sion at the next meeting of the Citizens'
Colonization Committee. When the plan
of action shall have been agreed upon the
work of collecting subscriptions will he
proceeded with, so that when the time
comes lor breaxing ground in the spring
everything may be in readiness to start
the pioneer colony,* which will be the fore
runner of many others. , ~ â¢

BARILLAS RISES
IN HIS WRATH
Declares He Never Talked
Marriage to Miss
Blair. \l
Incidentally He Pays His Re
spe:ts to Interpreter
Ribas.
â  * .
The Swarthy Don Juan Cmnot Get
the "Hang" at a Distance of
the Present Row. ;'â¢
The echoes of the affidavit match now
going on between Attorney Henry L.
Dimond and the Blr.ir family have
reached Guatemala. From his coffee
plantation the swarthy Don Juan rises to
explain that he never contemplated marry
ing Miss Blair. It was a mere affair, so to
speak. Through tne medium of friends
General Barillas has written that he is
going to even matters up if any attempt is
made to drag him into the squabble.
The Guatemalan millionaire evidently
does not love Arraande Ribas with the
fervor the interpreter would have his
friends believe. In his letters Barillas in
timates that the Blair breach of promise
case, which attorneys once intended bring
ing, was a scheme to lighten his pocket
book, and he intimates that Ribas was the
principal in the plot, Miss Blair being,
however, a willing and anxious second.
When the storm was threatening some
weeks ago Ribas hastened to assure his
patron of his friendship, at tbe same time
declaring that Miss May Taber and her
brother-in-law, A. Bern were the insti
gators oi the plot. Now the tables are
turned on tne interpreter. Miss Taber
has in her possession his correspondence
with Barillas, and some comments by the
millionaire on Ribas and the Blair im
broglio in general. Here is an extract
which sums up Barillas' long-distance
estimate of the row:
"I have just received yonr cable, in which
you speak of Miss Lillian Blair's suit. I am
astonished. I can only find reason for this in
this scoundrel Ribas. She has absolutely no
reason and no justice on her side. I never
understood a word of hers. 1 have seen her a
comparatively few times. Once 1 invited her
to the Palace Hotel, and I nave seen her other
wise in her mother's house. Do not be misled
by the lies which doubtless will be circulated
by Ribas.
You will remember that he wrote me at New
York, which letter I remit to you that you
may see to what lengths he has gone to do
harm. I do not doubt that he went to San
Francisco to prepare this disagreeable busi
ness for me. Also that upon seeing the colors
in which the whole affair was necessarily to
be shown up that he wrote to me to New York
Togo tne other way fearing reactionary re
sults. lam in receipt of another letter from
him, and also there is one for Bruni in
which he corroborates the same story ami
adding an implied blame upon Mr. Bera'ns. 1
believe the whole thing is tue work of Rivas.
I am told, among other things, that 1 have
offered her matrimony. Ido not know how.
or when. lam waiting my letters from San
Francisco lor more light on this point. In no
way or in no manner have I had such supposed
serious relations with Miss Blair. Believe me,
and the proof will not be long, in coming. I
do not see this thing clearly. Cannot under
stand. lam confused. You have good judg
ment and can judge of the seriousness of this
affair.
I have ceased to be surprised at anything. I
suppose I should not look so indifferently
upon the matter and should realize that those
who are implicated will stop at nothing.
Miss Taber declares that she feels justi
fied in making public General Barillas'
opinion of the scandal, in view of a long
standing friendship with him. She deeply
deplores the whole incident and regrets
exceedingly that she should have been in
any way dragged Into it,
- 4 "I have no ill feeling toward any of the
actors in tbe controversy," said Mis*
Taber. ''Miss Blair Ido not know, but I
have nothing but the kindest feeling to
ward her. This is not a case of one woman
against another. It is an unfortunate
affair, and I feel very sorry for every bod
who is mixed up in it. My own position
consists in simply being a friend of Gen
eral Barillas. When he came to this City
he was lavish in his generosity to all who
met him. This confidence has , been
abused and he was imposed upon, and that
is ail there is to it."
To-morrow afternoon Louis Hirsch will
continue his deposition before Court Com
missioner Lawl-r.
TRIAL OF THE MARIETTA.
The Official Teat Held Yesterday Over
the Mew Course Near Cali
fornia City.
The official trial trip of the gunboat
Marietta, which has just been completed
by the Union Iron Works, was held yes
terday over the official course near Cali
fornia City. Representatives of the
United States Board of Inspection and
the Union Iron Works were on board.
The vessel left the Union Iron Works at
8 o'clock and did not return until late in

twelve knots per hour. Yesterday the
gunboat was run at the required speed for
four successive hours, as required by the
contract. The exact performance made
by the Marietta will not be known for a
day or two until the results have been
calculated from the data obtained on the
several trial trips.

SLEPT UNDER THE
SAME BLANKETS
Alexander Boyd Tells of
His Partnership With
Jacob Z Davis.
Mined Together on the Yuba
and Made a Fortune as
House-Builders.
W. G. Dongall Int*rj-cts a Note of
Doubt in the Great Will Contest
in Judge Ciffy's Court.
In probate litigation the relations of
counsel are subject to lightning changes,
as was yesterday illustrated in the differ
ent positions of Attorneys George A.
Knight and Garret McEnerney, who while
in Judge Slack's court are engaged as ac
tive coadjutors in the Fair estate contest,
but as soon as they walked across the
corridor to Judge Coffey's courtroom,
where the Jacob Z. Davis contest is on
Yesterday's Important Witnesses in the Jacob Z. Davis "Will
Contest -in Judge Coffey's Court*
trial, they took seats on opposite sides of
tbe table and were equally energetic in
their antagonism.
. Another crowd of interested listeners
greeted the opening of the third day's
proceedings of the Davis estate contest.
The most entertaining feaiure of the day
was the testimony of Alexander Bovd,
surviving partner of Mr. Davis. Although
confessing to 76 years of sunshine and
shadow Mr. Boyd is hale and hearty, and
nave bis testimony in a manner that, gave
a hint of the strong character that is the
distinguishing mark of so many of the
pioneers of the State.
At tl c close of Tuesday's proceedings
John M. Curtis, husband of Mrs. Belle
Curtis, one of the proponents of the will,
was on the witness-stand, having been
subjected to the questioning of lawyers,
friendly and hostile, for two solid days.
Mr. Knight began his redirect exam
ination of Witness Curtis by calling his
attention to certain testimony given by
him in regard to keys found in the safe in
Boyd & Davis* office. Mr. Curtis said he
remenioered the circumstances attending
the finding of the keys. The only Key he
obtained at that time was a key to the safe
which contained the ashes of Mrs. Davis
He took the key to the Davis residence,
408 Post street, where there were three
safes, and searched until he found the safe
that the key would open.
Several apparent discrepancies in the
direct testimony of Mr. Curtis were taken
tin ana explanations were asKed for by Mr.
Knight. The doubts and difficulties were
pretty thoroughly discussed, and at last it
was a*, reed by Curtis and . Mr. Boyd
to open the copper urn contain
ing the ashes of Mrs. Davis for the
purpose of finding a will if one existed,
because search in other directions had
been ineffectual. _Â§^_j__gfggjfiÃ3l
Mr. Knight asked that Mr. Curtis make
a tracing of the signature of Jacob Z. Da
vis as it appeared in the so-called wife
will, in which all the estate was devised
to Mrs. Davis, who died before he did.
Mr. Campbell objected to having the
witness put to the inconvenience of writ
ing with his paper up against the window
pane. He said it was not material as evi
dence, anyhow.
Mr. Knight said that be wanted to prove
that the alleged will here offered for pro
bate could be produced by this witness by
tracing from the original writings that
were in the possession of Mr. Curtis.
, Mr. Campbellâ nonsense.
â â  Mr. Knightâ could do it myself. Give me
the original and 1 will guarantee to repro
duce it here in court in ten minutes.
Mr. Campbellâ lf you can do that you are a
dangerous man to be at large In the * commu
nity.
Mr. Knightâ at all. There are thou
sands wno can do the same, it is a simple
thing. Anybody can do it
Mr. Campbellâ So that it will not be de
tected as a forgery?
Mr. Knightâ Ah, that Is another matter.
That is the question to be settled here.
It was finally agreed that * Mr. Curtis
should be excused from making the pro
posed tracing until a convenient pane ol
glass could c-e procured.
George H. Mastick, one of the attorneys
for the proponents of the will, was called
by Mr.' Knight and was asked to give- his
opinion of the habits of the <iecea.*eJ. Mr.
Masticlt said that the firm of which he is
a member had been legal advisers to Mr.
Davis for a great many years. He ad
mitted; that the dead man might have
been what some people call cranky,* but
he regarded him as a careful business
man. He knew little of the alleged hob
bies of ; Mr. Davis and never knew of his
relations with the various public societies
of the City except what :he rend In tut
newspapers. He read that v Mr. Davis
assisted in. the prosecution : of Jake Lindo
who was accused of 'cruelty to. animals'
and that Mr. Davis had applied to be'apl
pointed r Poundmaster? order % that the
might carry out his ide_s in regard to a
humane management of that institution.
.John Senderling's visit to San Francisco
was next inquired! into,* and * Mr. Mastick
ad mi ted that he has in his possession a
paper that . was .banded -,- to him iby ;â ' Mr.
Senderling. : Mr. ; Knight intimated that
this paper is a writing purporting to be
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 27, 189 T.
the last will of Jacob Z. Davis, and that he
was engaged in composing it within half
an hour of his death. > Mr. Mastick prom
ised to produce the paper in court and
gave way to Mr. Boyd, the surviving part
ner of tbe firm of Boyd & Davis.
Alexander Boyd testified that he first
met Mr. Davis in the United States navy
yard at Pensacola, Fla., where thev, were
both engaged as carpenters at $2 50 a day.
While there he learned that Davis' true
name was; Dedaker. A man from Phila
delphia recognized Davis and told of the
change of name. When questioned in re
gard to the mutter Davis said that was so,
and explained that he changed his name
at the suggestion of his mother, ;in
order to escape the clutches of a
master carnenter to whom he had
been apprenticed and who did not
treat him rightly. He did not teach him
the trade, was cruel, failed to give him
proper food and swindled him in the mat
ter of clothing. Mr. Knight agreed with
Mr. Boyd that there was nothing in the
life history of . Mr. Davis that could be
spoken to* his discredit: that he was in
every respect a good citizen; . that he al
ways sent money home to his mother and
his aunt Rebecca Mason.
A chapter of frontier â .'. experience was
given by Mr. 80/ d. He said that he and
Mr. Davis formed their partnership in
Florida in 1848 and came direct to Califor
nia. They went to the mines and due
gold between the Middle and North forks
of the Yuba River. 'Their gold dust went
into one sack: they bached in the same
cabin, ate bacon and beans from the same
kettle; one pair of blankets covered them
both, and they were just like brothers in
everything. They were successful in min
ing, and when the autumn freshets washed
away their dams they went, to Sacra
mento, where they began building homes.
In 1861 they were flooded and moved to
San Francisco, where they have since re
mained, and nave been partners ever
-since.
When Mr. Davis' mother died it affected
him very much, said the. witness. He
went East to see about his mother's
estate, but never told how much he got
out of it. HpÃÂ£f.
Mr. Campbell objected , to this line ol
questions, which gave Mr. Hepgerty an
opportunity to explain that the contest*
ants of the will proposed to Drove that
Jacob Z. Davis, under the name of Ded
aker, took two-thirds of his mother's
estate, and that she made that provision
in her will because he bad sent money to
her almost constantly from . time to time
from Florida and California, giving the
present contestants only one-third other
property.
Mr. Campbell interjected the remark
that the contestants charged, such distri
bution of the estate of Mr. Davis' mother
had caused animosity between the fami
lies of the contestants and the deceased.
He failed to see what all that had to do
with the case at oar. â y-'.yh;'
Mr. Knight promised to connect tbe
circumstances in a logical way.
To this Mr. Campbell replied that there
are bnt three issues on trial. First, did
Jacob Z. Davis write the will here pre
sented for probate ; second, was he of
sound mind; third, was he under undue
influence at the time this instrument was
executed. -
Judge Coffey said he would expect Mr.
Knight to establish the relevancy of this
character of testimony before . proceeding
further in this direction.' :. *
Nevertheless, Knight was permitted to
show that Mr. Boyd and Mr. Davis mar
| ried sisters, named McGregor, and that
Mrs. Muir, mother of the beneficiaries un
der the will, was a Miss McGregor, a sis
ter of Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Boyd.
W. G. Dougall, foreman of Montague's
hardware-store, testified that the copper
box to contain Mrs. Davis' ashes was or
dered by Mr. Davis, and that after the
ashes were deposited therein the box was
sealed up by Mr. Davis' quest with a
soldering . iron. This, he declared, oc
curred not later than September 21,1896.
Mr. Knight showed be regarded this as
important, since he repeatedly called at
tention to the fact that the will was dated
October ' 1, 1896. The testimony showed
that Mr. Davis went East October 2, 1896.
Mr. Dougall saw Mr. Davis have a small
piece of paper in his hand, but did not
know what it contained. . , A
Mr.' Djugall was shown a written state
ment purporting to be signed by him in
which it was set forth that tbe sealing of
the box took place on the Ist of October
and he *<vas asked if he had written his
name then.
, ; "Yes, that's my signature," he replied,
and then he explained that he was busy
when the paper was presented to him;
that he supposed it was all right and that
he signed it as a matter of course without
scrutinizing it. -;-*,
Mr. Boyd was recalled and testified that
Mr. Davis told him his relations, meaning
the contestants in this case, had treated
him badly and that they should: never
have a dollar of his property. AJ^JJir '-â >.
â  . Coming down to the date of Mr. Davis'
departure for the East Mr. Boyd said that
he and Mr. Davis met on October 1 to talk
over their business and after they had dis
posed of t.Leir affairs Mr. Davis said: "I
have something to tell yon. '*;;_ have made
my will and I have provided for the girls.
When I come back 1 intend to make those
girls my children according to law."
"I asked him where we could > find the
will, "-'said^ Mr. Boyd, "and he replied:
'With Mr. Mastick.'"", -..â ."â¢
', Mr. Mastick says no will was left with
him by Mr. Davis. ,
Further hearing of the case will be
taken up at 10:30 this morning. :

New York, May 20, 1897.
To Editor of CALL, San Francisco,
Vy Dear Sir:-- In. reply to your late advice, lam pleased to
state that I have discovered a reliable and absolute cure for
consumption (in any climate), bronchial, throat and all lung and
chest troubles; catarrhal affections, stubborn coughs^general
decline or weakness and loss of flesh. By; its timely use, tens
of thousands of sufferers have already been permanently cured.
- I know that there are many of your readers who would be
benefited, and saved from an early grave, if they would allow
me to advise them in the use of my modern scientific discover-
ies. In fact, I have such absolute faith in their "Power to
Cure," based upon actual experience, that I will send THREE
FREE BOTTLES (aril different) of my Remedies (The New Slocum*
System of Medicine) to any of your readers afflicted, who will
write me at my Laboratory, No. 98 Pine Street, New York, giving
their full address.
_- Always: sincerely yours ><jC
MJfowmfflVA.
â .i TO Our. Readers:â The Medical Profession J throughout America and
Europe are nearly unanimous in the opinion that head, throat, chest and lung
troubles lead to consumption, and consumption, uninterrupted, means speedy
and certain death. We publish the Doctor's letter for our readers' benefit, and
respectfully suggest that every 'sufferer should take advantage of his most
generous offer. A medicine that will cure consumption ought to be good for any
disease. 'We ask in writing to kindly tell him of having read the above letter in
the SAN FRANCISCO CALL.

I
Had the cc?nsns of Berkeley been taken
yesterday, that burg would have shown an
increase of 25,000 persons over its regular
population. This inciease did not all
come from San Francisco. Sacramento,
Stockton, Martinez, Petaluma, San Jose,
Santa Cruz, Redwood City, and other
towns adjacent to this City contributed
their share to the incr ase.
"Butchers' day" was a holiday without
the aid of a proclamation. The popularity
of the men of the block and clever is so
well reconnized by the thousands of
families who daily patronize those gener
ous and liberal-minded men that ladies
and children with their escorts filled boats
and trains during the earlier part of the
day. AH were bound for Shell Mound
Park and the racecourse, where a most
elaborate programme had been prepared
for their amusement.
The wholesale millionaire butcher with
the youngest journey at the block
fraternized with the utmost familiarity.
Genial M. Schweitzer had a pleasant word
and a warm shake of the hand for every
one who greeted him. Sam**C. Hammond,
president of the Board of Trade, made
himself useful and accommodating to all.
He was all over the racetrack seeing to
the wants of those who sought informa
tion on points of the sports.
The judges, W. Owens, Isidore Selig, B.
Horn and John Hayden â performed the
duties assigned to them to the entire
satisfaction to all; so did the timersâ
Jes*** S. Potter. 6. Nutting and B. L.
Fisher, while Starter Armand Decourtieux
-en i his fields off in good order.
The same general tone of satisfaction
was carried out and appreciated in Shell
Mound Park, where the lesser contests
were competed for. Here the committee
on camp?, Ed Taffe, H. Meyer, J. Bender.
J. H. Goldmeyer and C. Stein, performed
their duties with commendable fairness.
The event that every person was anx
ious to see was the steer race, and in this
there was no disappointment.- The race
was run, much to the amusement of ail.
Had liieb fence-jumping en on the pro
eramm â¢ instead of distance and time, M.
Schweitzer would have been the proud
possessor of the best high-flyer. His steer,
America, took it into bis head to bolt the
course anil ran at a six-rail fence which
separated the course from the inclosure
leading to the stables. This he cleared
with one bound. His rider had the fore
thought, however, to throw himself off
before the fence was reached.
The following is a summary of events on
the racetrack:

What Makes Men Strong?
ELECTRICITYâ Fountain of Youth, the perpetual energy, which sustains
all animal life. . It is the source from which springs the bubbling spirit of joy in
young manhood. It is the vital element which keeps up the nerve force in old men

Confidence flashes from the eye and the step is firm. Without itâ well, bow is it with
yon ? Are you weak, gloomy, wanting physical end brain force ? If you are weak
you should begin at once using this famous appliance for weak men. ~
This appliance is the result of twenty years of close study, and contains all the
recent improvements known to science. It is, in fact, a perfect battery made in the
form of a belt, to be worn on the body while the patient rests.

THE DEFENSE OF
THE PRESIDIO
How the Post Would Be
Protected From the
Enemy.
An Important Military Move
ment Demonstrated by
the Soldiers.
Six Hu_dred Men on Outpost Duty.
Brtwns Captured by Bines While j
Crossing the Line.
The outpost duty. at the Presidio yester
day was one of the most extensive mili
tary maneuvers that has ever been under
taken at that post. To accomplish the
object it required the entire garrison of
the post, about 600 men, and included the
three branches of the service, the cavalry,
light artillery and infantry.
The day was bright, the sky clear and
the sun was warm, but not so much so as to
make it uncomfortable. It was just such
a day as inspires men who take an inter
est in the work to be performedâ and' the
rank and file took a great deal of interest
in the problem of yesterday to action.
The reason that the men took so much in
terest in the event was that it was rough
work and a variation from the humdrum
monotony of parade ground exercise such
as "two right," "lours left," which looks
pretty, but when once learned is only one
small portion of the duties that a soldier
should know.
The problem that was presented yester
day by Captain John J. O'Connell of Com
pany E, First Infantry, was the placing of
men so as to protect the Presidio post
from the attack of an enemy supposed to
be approaching from -the south and the
southwest. It was not a battle between
opposing forces, simply the placing of the
available force to prevent the advance of
an enemy and to protect the post irom be
ing captured. â  The post is assailable from
land from three sidesâ from the south,
from the east and from the wet â the
problem was how to dispose of the men so
as to cover those three possible points of
attack and check the advance of an en-
emy. ' j... 'â ,''_ ..'.'. . - JJA'CJJJ
On the north side of the line of the Pre
sidio reservation there is now being built
a strong stone wall, and within the line of
that wall there is a magnificent avenue
that parallels it flora Central to First ave
nue, and then it takes a turn to the south
west and terminates at the Marine Hospi
tal. Â.--,- , â -. ' * ' .- â¢ -
North of this road between the two ave
nues named there is a border of forest
trees about seventy-five feet wide, and be
tween that and the quarters of tne post
there is a wide stretch of territory that is
known in military parlance as v "open."
North and west of this open country there
is a frinj-e of fores t> trees. Beyond, this
fringe, which ; includes the northwestern
part of the reservation, on which are the
lort i fications at -: Fort â  Point, there lisâ ; a
stretch of territory, of I sanddunes up hill
and down glade on. which there is but lit
tle protection for soldiers beyond the cover
of lupin: and J scrub oak which would en
able them to conceal themselves from the
enemy... Â\ .... *.' -â¢. - .: J: x "*
* Ti.e wall from central, avenue west as
far. as built is as good a defense: as any
military commander could desire, and one
of the safest positions that men on the de
fensive could wish to occupy. Experience
is that in action an advancing enemy will
never run against a stone wall, as it means
sure death to the advancing force, and it
is a position that can be held with a com
paratively, small force of men. From the
Central-avenue gate there is a shaded road
3277 feet long that leads to the main pa
rade ground, while east of this road there
is considerable country through which an
enemy could maroh to the point to be
cantured. .'"-".-â¢';â â¢..'â .',â  ; ,'''''"
The troops that were available yester
day for â  the covering \oti' this territory,
which embraced front and flanks, some
thing ? more than ; two miles ?* Jon-.stwere
Troops Band I,' Fourth Cavalry, Light Bat
teries C, F, G and Third Artillery, and
Companies A, E, F ; and G. First Infantry.
; The cavalry was under command of j Cap-
tain James Lockett of Troop I, the artii
lerv under command of Captain Ramsay
D. Potts of Light Battery C and the infan
try under,: command of Captain Charles
G. Starr of Company F. The scouts of
the enemy; were represented by a squad of
Browns under command; of Lieutenant
Hiram McL. Powell of Company A. -
At half-past 8 o'clock ; in" the morning
the men of the various branches of the
service were assembled, and in accordance
with orders previously issued the officers
moved their commands to the respective
positions that were assigned them and
which they were required to occup,- in the
demonstration of the problem.; A section
of the â¢ Light Artillery was- moved along
the road to a point on the road to Central
avent'e, and was placed at the entrance to
a cross road, from which, while being shel-.
tered by trees from the view of an ap
proaching enemy, the artillerymen
had a commanding view of any body of
men approaching the center, and from
there could have mowed them down with
out being in aanger to any perceptible
extent It was a magnificent position
and very creditable to the one who se
lected it. Another section of the artillery'
took up a position at the entiance from
the First-avenue gate, and there, under
the shelter of tall trees, occupied a com
manding position, but possibly not so safe
as the one occupied by the artillerymen
near Central avenue. The cavalry was
assigned to the duty of covering the ter
ritory from First avenue- to the mouth of
Point Lobos Creek. That was a long 5
stretch of country, but in the light of
subsequent events it was well protected,
Tne infantry 4 was marched up the ave
nue on the north, and then, when on the
avenue, moved toward the east ; As
viewed from the eminence at the Central
avenue gate, the men coming down the
grade at route step, close order, presented
a fine appearance, but .ormed a good tar
get if the enemy had been there to fire
upon them. In a few minutes after ap
pearing on the road men were detailed
from the ranks to act as sentinels, and
they were posted on the line of Jackson
street on the south, then tb re were
sent out artillerymen as sentinels east of
Central avenue, . and in the meantime
sentinels were sent out from the cavalry. '
Men were also stationed at places behind
the Wall. y. - _ J ", 'â *.-"'
One of the men who was against the
wall, but with his head so exposed that it
was plainly visible to the enemy, was ad
dressed by one of the officers, who asked
if he could see one of the sentinels at Pa
cific avenue. The reply promptly *â  given
was "Yes, sir." ' "Then," continued the
officer, "you can be seen too and you had
better get behind this tree," pointing to
one near by. .*. The ; soldier obeyed and,
when in position, was asked if he could
still see the sentinel. Again he answered
"Yes, sir," and the officer volunteered the
iniormalion, "You are in just as advan
tageous position as he, but you are better
protected." It was a brief lesson, but one
the soldier will probably never forget.
While the sentinels were going to their
respective posts small groups of men were
sent into the trees at certain distances
apart. These were -he pickets, and behind
these were larger groups of men called the
supports, and at the northern end of the
open was the reserve, . com posed of the
light artillery not otherwise disposed, and
back of these was, in piac;- of the main
army, the quarters that were being de
fended. "~
The men who were the supports were;
in fact, yesterday the strong line of re
sistance, for in case of buttle they 'would
have been advanced to the picket line to
engage" the .advance of the enemy. The
position that the infantry held was as de
sirable as could be asked for. Had the
enemy forced this; line it would have had
to move across the open,* where; it | would
have been met by the fire of the guns on
the east and by the batteries to the north
of them, which fire .would. have created
great havoc in â  the midst of a body of
troops.; * â - ' ; ; . â¢.';â  ;â ;.-.â â  *â  â  'J v."'â¢'.
--â  The sentinels made a' good showing^ at
their several posts,. but. the infantry was
not in | appearance jas r formidable as 'â < the
troopers, who, mounted 'on ; their charges,
stood fast with either carbine or;' revolver
in hand. The pickets took it easy; under
the shelter â¢of 'â â  the trees, and stretched
themselves on the ground while waiting
for orders. - v ;^ > ' â " : JJJ
While the men were "at ease" LiÂ«*uten-;
ant Dennis E. Nolan, who the day, before
had; through three decoys been led into
a; trap by,: Lieutenant Beat, who was in
charge of the Browns detailed to capture
a wagon-train^ got - upon *â¢; the top of I the
wall to survey the situation. Just at that
moment Lieutenant Bent, who was um
pire for the day, happened to come along
and a civilian ;; who .bad* witnessed the
event :of ? the day previous addressed the
umpire., saying: "Lieutenant, there's the
officer you â¢ got into a trap yesterday and
metaphorically, killed. He is in a very ex
posed position, is he not?", J "'Yes," said
the umpire."that Lieutenant Nolan is the
most -i reckless â Â£ officer in J the 'post. * ' He
don't know what danger is." ; ,
While the men y were being posted Cap
tain O'Connell, the promoter of the event'
who was mounted:; on a fast dark horae
and ? accompanied by an :â  orderly, was rid
ing from ; point to point to see that every
thing was 'being; carried out, and besides
these two horsemen: there were mounted
couriers and couriers afoot carrying orders
Irom one officer to another, and for a
\ while : there wasH being done ; everything
that is done on the defensive -when an
attack is expected.' 'â, ~ ,â¢'_ *
ii To many spectators who were watching
the event and were expecting to witness a
skirmish, bear , the roar of artillery, the
sound of volleys and the clash of sabers,
the movements were strange and did not
have the amount 01 excitement that they.
anticipated, but as a military movement
it was one well planned with possibly one
exception, and all the orders were well
and faithfully carried out. The one ex
ception was the massing of too much in-;
fantry, considering: .the available force,
behind the stone wall, which could have
been defended with at most half the men
who were* ordered ; to that point, and the
balance of the men could have been sent
to points where they could have been ef
fective. J.y
The first half hour of the solving of the
problem was the disposition of the men;
for a day outpost. After that the night
outpost was demonstrated. It was very
similar to the day duty," but the sentinels
were moved inward to the inside of the
line of the stone wall and posted very close
together. â ' â¢ â¢*â ' \J'.yJJ'.
During the demonstration of the prob
lem the Browns, who were at various*
points to the south and on the right hank
of the Blues, made attempts to sneak into
the lines of the Blues, but two of them
were taken by the infantry and turned
over as prisoners of war to Lieutenant
Nolan's, command. Lieu'enant Powell,
who was in command of the Browns, suc
ceeded in passing the line held by the
cavalry, but his success was but momen
tary, for a trooper spied m, went for and
made him prisoner. Five other Brown
men who were crawling through the lupin
to get by the troopers' were discovered and
were also made prisoners. vâ¢ â¢
Captain O'Connell expressed himself as
very well pleased with the; result of the
forenoon's work and gave unlimited praise
to Captain Lockett for the masterly man
ner in which he bandied the troops under
his command. ;. -
' One of tne officers at the post in discuss
ing the work of the morning said: "Of
course th^re is a difference of. opinion as
to whether the: problems that have been
submitted are correct in every particular,
but be that as it may it is practical exer
cise that is bound to result in great good
to the service. It is exhilarating, and it is
the means of developing ideas as to how
an attack or defense should be made.
The lessons so- acquired will certainly be
of service if the troops should be called
out for action in earnest." -Then he added
that it is doubtful if the troops will leave
the post this year for an encampment, as
there does not appear to be any appropri
ation for that purpose. He was, however,
of the opinion that the men can get all
the needed exercise' on the Presidio
reservation.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word â¢hlirh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable:
but when the "low- is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK EXCHANGE.
NEW YORK, N. V.. May -Trading on the
Stock Exchange was dull at the outset, but the
values were firm, Improvements being shown In
international 'shares. Northern Pacific common
fell off i/2, while preferred gained Vs-
Sugar was largely dealt* in at the higher level.
An urgent demand by the shorts carried Western
Union up 114 on a revived rumor that an amic
able working agreement would be perfected with
tee Bell telephone interests.
The market diplaytd considerable animation
and strength after the first hour, material Im
provements being shown In a number of snares.
Purchases of sugar were on a large scale, the price
rising to 116.
The distinct change in the sentiment that has
taken place In Wall street since the | beginning of
the week resulted 111 further covering of short con
tracts on the exchange to-day. There was also a
noticeable incre in the volume of commission
business. Another interesting feature w *s the re
luctance of professional traders to sell stock at an
advance witu a view of profiling by the reaction
which many of them, influenced by recent pie
cedt-ntt, regard as inevitable. They were re
ft rained Irom doing so by the fact that it has been
patent to many observers all along that there is
no liquidation by actua holders, and that the bulk
or the selling has been by themselves. A slightly
hifrher market for American securities in London
conmed for very little here, because foreign arbi
tra ing houses appeared as moderate Kellers a. the
early advance. The more hopeful fseling mat
/prevails can be attributed in part to the belief,
encouraged from Washington, that the tariff bill
-w 111 now be progressing rapidly.
The decision of the United states Supreme
Court that the Interstate Commerce Commission
does not possess the power to make rales has also
been effective In changing the temper or these in
terested in securities- Dealings in stocks, though
somewhat smaller than yesterday, were rather
. b iter distributed, a d in spite of the sales to take
profit in the latter pare of the day a large number
of stocks closed materially higher than yesterday
and the tone throughout was decidedly stronger.
The most extensive trading was in the granger
stocks, but .-agar Refinery, Jt-rsey Central, Wes.
ern Union and Chicago Gas scored the most im
portant net advances. . Atchison preferred re
ceived even more attention than yesterday, and
made a more pronounced -* progress toward a
hisherleve;.
The only slock that m de an unfavorable record
was Baltimore and Ohio. The sharp decline In it
wait accompanied. by the, receiver's report that
they had been unable .o maKe the payments due
June 1 upon the terminal bonis and several other
obligations of the company. Five hundred thou
sand dollars in gold will be exported to-morrow,
making the total for : this week $2,900,000, and
since the present movement began, a little more
than $6,000,000, the shipment of which, less
than half being taken from . the â¢ sub-treasury, had
no effect whatever upon the market.' Ihe closing

CHICAGO, Ix&, May 26 â Bog receipts continue
on a liberal scale. To-day's receipts at se/en
Western markets, Chicago included, were 93,000,
against 68,000 last year. This Is the principal
bearish factor and prices are lower. There was
liberal selling by outside "longs" and leading
packers, "shorts" were the only buyers. In spot
there was a sharp decline, and many think prices
will reach a still lower level unless there is a
marked falling off in receipts.

YESTERDAY'S WHEAT MARKET.
The following resume of the wheat market is
furnished by E. A. , Bresse, Produce Exchange
grainbroker, 412 Pine street.
San Feancisco, May 26, 1897.
Chicago.
Wheat opened slightly higher than yesterday's
close,* but the advance proved lof short duration.
Selling out of a few lines imparted weakness to
the market. Northwestern receipts, are disap
pointing to holders, showing a large ' Increase as
compared with those of last year at this time.
Liverpool ' futures were depressed, * as *. were
French markets. About the â¢ only consolation
bulls found was in the way of heavy shipments.
This fact appeared of very slight importance. The
market presented a dragging appearance almost
throughout the session. July declined from 71% c
to 69*-/ 8 rallied to 70y 8 c on buying by commis
sion bouses with New York connections, : St.
.Louis was Inclined to the short side of the market.
Liquidation seems going on in wheat. Holders
are beginning to weaken In their position, and
this naturally results in a dtcllning market. , The
French shortage is not looked upon as a matter of
much mo.ent just now ana the sentiment of floor
traders is decidedly In favor of the bears Many
prominent operators who throw their Influence to
the long side of wheat have gone or are about to go
out of town on their summer vacation. This takes
away a strong ta:tor in maintaining values. 1 hi
cause is one of the many now affecting the wheat
market. -â ..'.--.- .s â -
Â The very liberal northwestern receipts put
many to guessing whether or not the spring wheat
crop of last year was not larger than reported It
will taice a month or more ; to : reduce the visible
supply to a point where speculators will find reason
to pause before depressing prices 100 far. By July
1 the trade can fainy judge crop yie.ds at home as
well as " abroad. Â« 'I his once . settled mere will b
something to guide operations, which at this lime
seem only conjecture. : : *':,>. : -- 7 ...-i..;.

COALâ A circular for Australia says: "In the
oast three months the j total arrivals irom Austra
lia foot up only ' 31,260 tons,' hence the market Is
now almost entirely without fuel from that sec
tion, but there are * fully due 21 vessels from Syd
ney and Newcastle to arrive here within the next
60 days with about 58.000 tons, hence there is a
liberal supply in sight. There is already listed
equal to 155,000 tons Coal capacity from Austra
lia, all or which should arrive here this year.
Freight rates are - quoted firm at 12s 8d to 12s 9d
from Newcastle, : with a good tonnage demand. '
The : consumption locally this. year for fuel for
manufacturing purposes will be less than last, as
our factories are all running on short time for lack
of orders and : tie general stagnancy of business
makes Housekeepers economize their Coal con
sumption. The anticipated elimination of the
word 'bituminous' from the tariff, thus placing
all foreign Coals on a similar footing, both anthra
cite and bituminous, win be welcome news to Aus
tralian colliery proprietors, as by reducing Swan
sea shipments they will relatively increase their
own and should establish better prices- What the
duty will be it is difficult to say, or when the Mime
will go Into effect, :as . the framers are making
haste very slowly." : '

Trading continued light in mining stocks and

The . Confidence, Challenge Consolidated ' and
Consolidated -Imperial west crosscut 1 from the
surface tunnel is out 1200 feet, having been ad
vanced 20 feet during the week; tne face is in por
phyry. | The face of this drift Is now at a point
where they had hoped to encounter the downward
extension of the large vein that crops out on the
surface. A slight change, in the: angle, however,"
might cause the vein to straighten. In that case:
they would have to go some distance further than '
they at first figured on. The face of this drift con- '
tinues in vein porphyry of a favorable character.
Some years ago the Een'.uck Mining Company ran
a west drift on the north line of" their claim 200
feet deeper than the present Confidence,' Challenge
Consolidated \ and J Consolidated Imperial west
crosscut, and cut the vein, but never prospected
it. The Crown "Point, Kentuck and Yellow
Jacket companies are now repairing this drift,
with a view oi thoroughly exploring the west vein
at that point.
* No ore was taken from the Confidence mine dar
ing the past week. Fast crosscut from the raise
.on the fourth floor, 63 feet above the surf-tie tun
ne , Is out 50 feet, having been advauced*7 feet
during the week: the face is in quartz giving : low
assays.
The yield of the Overman mine for the past week
amounted to ten carloads of ore, the average as
say value of which was $4,1 52 per ton. The ore
came from the north drift on the 600 level. There
Is no change In the condition of the : mine. They
shipped 130 tons and 380 pounds of accumulated
ore to the Brunswick mill. ..
After three postponements of the date of delin
quency of the assessment of 6 cents per share on

pany, the directors have finally.rescinded the as- J
sessment. â¢: Â, . :. -Â -
The Pacific Woodenwiire and 'Cooperage Com

KISS HIS HONOR
Floyd Has No Redress i

Legs.
Clarence Lewis Acquitted
Shcoting at His Fiancee's
Aged Lover.
On the Witness-stand She Told
Her Engagement and of the Oil
Man's Infatuation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
90S Broadway, May 26. )
Clarence Lewis has been acquitted of
the charge of -riootin-^at his jealous aged
rival, E. P. Floyd of Pleasanton, and
when Justice Taylor, who is himself an
elderly man, rendered his decision, several
ladies who were in court rushed up to him
and kissed him.
Lewis and Floyd had trouble a week a*ro
over a young lady named Miss Barbara
Keed. The lady once received an offer of
marriage from Floyd, who is old enough
to be her father. He keeps a saloon at
Pleasanton, and although he is of an age
when most people commence to prepare
for leaving this world, he could not help
falling in love with Barbara, the belle of
the town. Floyd did not believe that the
"no" he received was a judgment from
which there was to be no appeal and he
consoled himself that it was only a de
murrer, and hoped on.
Six months ago Clarence Lewis went to
work on the Pleasanton stock farm, and
he soon became acquainted with Miss
Reed. The friendship grew until orange
blossoms and white veils were discussed
by the townfolK. This angered Floyd,
and one evening he sallied forth with his
gun that would not shoot to find Lewis.
He found him and there was a fusillade
that has already been reported. Lewis'
gun worked all right, and he put several
bullets in tbe old man's legs, for which
he was tried for attempted murder.
Mi's Reed took the witness-stand and
added to Fioyd's grief by stating that she
was engaged to the prisoner and that
the/ were to be married next July. From
the evidence it was very evident that
Floyd started the shooting and Justice
Taylor said he was confident no jury
â¢would convict Lewis, who was discharged.
While the lobby cheered several women
rushed up to the Judge and embraced and
kissed him. He said nothing of contempt,
but seemed to enjoy the performance.
CUVELLIER EXPLAINS.
Accused Himself While Angry and 1
"Sow Modifies It. '
OAKLAND, Cal.. May 26.â Councilman
Cuveliier now repents talking so excitedly
last Monday night, and he has published
a statement which he declares is the true
representation of what occurred regard
ing the appointment of the wharfinger.
He says:
. In the first place I have not violated the
purity of elections law. I did not make any
promise to Mr. White before election. Mr.
.White did not know that I wrs going to vote
for him for city wharfinger till the night I
cast my ballot in the City Council. I was care
ful during the campaign to make no promise
or pledges to any one concerning any position.
I was provoked Monday night by the re
marks oi Mr. Jacobs and smarting still under
Mr. Girard's censure to the effect mat a num
ber of us had violated the civil-service plank
in the Republican platform. Evidently I ex
pressed myself wrongly. The idea I meant to
convey was that I had been told that Mr.
White worked in my interest in the Seventh
Ward, and that I felt to myself that I owed
him a debt of gratitude, and, though I made
him no promise nor to anybody c.Re lor him. I
made up my mind that I would vote for him
un the first and second ballots for the posi
tion. I was mistaken if I stated Monday night
that I had known him before the conventions
were he d. 1 have no recollections of ever
having met the gentleman until during the
campaign.
I am free to admit that I evidently got
rattled Monday night. But my life has been
made miserable during the past two weeks by
friends of one of the water companies who
have tracked me and talked tome and p'eaded
with me and used every powerful influence
which they could legitimately use to induce
me not to vote as 1 had declared I had intended
to vote on this water question.
I have no fault to find with the friends of
the water company who were so loyal to its
cause, but the strain upon me has been in
tense, and in a moment of excitement Mon
day night I must have pot things mixed up.
I am willing that Mr. Kassetior anybody else
should bring suit to impeach me if they think
that they can succeed in doing so. We will have
a little fun over the matter. They will find
that they have wasted their time and I will
remain In the City Council, for I have not vio
lated any law. it will afford a topic for the
newspapers, and as the newspapers have al
ways been kind to me if I can reciprocate in"
giving them something to write about I am at
their service. â 
I don't ii-ei like a man who is worried. I be
lieve in the old motto, "do right and fear
not."
The situation is mrde more peculiar by
the fact that Mr. White, . the wharfinger,
denies that he ever conversed with .\i r.
Cuveilier regarding his appointment be
fi re the election, in spite or' the- fact that
Mr. Cuveliier says that he did so, and he
was sorry for it.
Ex - Councilman Bassett, . who would
have first call on his seat should Cuveilier
resign, says that it is clearly a case for the
courts to decide. JtrfUÃtt

OAKLAND. Cal., May 26.â 0n Thurs
day evening of next week the Acme Club
â will take possesion of their new home.
To-day they have announced the pro
gramme for the first gentlemen's night,
on June 15, which will include some of the
best amateur boxing events ever brought
forward in this city.
As the Acme Club is not any longer a
member of the P. A. A. it is enabled to do
as it pleases in the matter of pr zes and
duration of contests. Two matches have
been made for the opening. J. McDonald
of the Manhattan Club and E. J. Smith of
the Acmes will contest for six round**.
McDonald and Smith will. weigh in at 142
pounds, and as both are very clever, scien
tific 'fellows an interesting time is ex
pected. , Smith has been boxing less than
a year, but has developed much talent
and is marvelously quick, and is a candi

Berries Not Poisonous.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 26.â The com
mission dealers of this city are highly in
censed at the reports that strawberries in
the Oakland markets have been treated
by Chinamen with paris green, and are
therefore likely to cause sickness. One
case was reported the other day of a
family whose sudden illness was said to
be the result of eating strawberries thus
treated. But it is now denied that such
was the case. F. Sinclair, one of the
oldest fruit-dealers in this city, said to-day :
I don't believe that the fruit sold by reputa
ble dealers ol this city is the cause of the sick
ness referred to. When a person purchases
fruit or any other article ot mod at retail ior
a less price than the dealer can buy it by the
carload, he must know that the quality is in
ferior and he takes his own chances it the re- ]
sult of eating it. I would suggest to the Health
Officer that he secure samples of berries of- i
fered for sale, subject them to a thorough ex
amination and announce the result of his in
vestigation through the press. I think this
should be done at once in tne interest of public
health, the berry grower and denier alike. I
don't think that articles detrimental to one
of the largest industries in this State should
be published broadcast without first being
positive that they are based on facts.

Old Isaac Homer Found With Two I
J'.'JiY Bibs Broken.
OAKLAND. Ca_, May 26.â Much mys
tery surrounds the death of Isaac B.
Homer, the old man who was found dead
near San Lorenzo bridge two days alter
he had left the county infirmary.
The Coroner is not satisfied with the
manner in. which the man, who is 77 years
jof age, came by his death. An autopsy
| held by D.s. Dean and Reynolds has
| revealed the fact that two of the ribs were
! broken and that death resulted from a
hemorrhage caused by a fractured bone
piercing the lungs. Homer was near
sighted, and it is supposed he might have
been struck by a car while walking along
the truck, but no report of such. accident
has been made. The Coroner partially
heard the evidence to-day and continued it
till to-morrow. It was reported that Hom
er's relatives are well-to-do, and the jury
thought they should hear from them as to
why the old man was eft at the infirmary.

There is considerable unrest at the City

the Police and Fire Commissioners held
this morning,
City Attorney Dow, who has all along
maintained that there should be no
changes in the heads of departments pro
vided the incumbents were proficient, in
troduced a series of resolutions putting
himself upon record. One of these reso
lutions provided that Chief Lloyd be re
appointed to the Police Department for
two years another that M. K. Miller be
reappointed to the Street Department for
two years, and another that W. H. Fair
be retained that length of time in the Fire
Department. - - â -
With the aid of the vote of Mayor
Thomas, Chief Lloyd was retained, City
Engineer Clement voting no. Thomas
and Clement, however, stood together
j against the re-election of Miller and Fair
and the resolutions regarding them were
not carried. â¢ . ... ..Â«<
! This brings the matter of the patronage

I the expected changes, and it is thought

Street Department and Fire Department
Cbieis* positions vacant and naming their
successors. *
The latest candidate to appear for Super
intendent ot Streets is William Kruse, who
was foreman of the railroad-shops several
years ago, and it is believed that when a
change is made either he or Mcl Holmes
will be the lucky man. .;.â  .'*â¢*-**-,
For Chief of the Fire Department Fred
Campbell is still a candidate, but two

FAINTED AND THEN DIED.
The Sad Death of the Ycuhg
Wife of City Trustee A. V.
Clark of Alameda.
Found Asphyxiated in a Toilet-Room
With Matches in Hmd and the
Gasccck Turned On Full.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 26.â Mrs. Mary
E. Clark (nee Carpenter), the wife of City
Trustee A. V. Clark, was found by him
this morning about 5 o'clock with just a
spark of life in her, in a toilet-room of
their home at 1444 Fifth street She had
evidently been asphyxiated with coal gas
and was in death's throes. Doctors worked
with the patient for over three hours, but
without success, for the lady died about 9
o'clock. , , â¢ , "
Mis Clark's death was, it is supposed,
the result of an accident. For some time
she had been uner; treatment for heart
trouble. A temporary disorder had con
fined her to her home for the past few
days. When her husband awoke .this
morning at 5 o'clock, his usual hour, he
found she was ab ent. . He sought her
and discovered her in the toilet-room
gasping for breath, a box of matches
clutched tightly in one hand and gas
(lowing from the open cock in the apart
ment.
The conclusion arrived at from all the
circumstances was that death was from
accidental asphyxiation, and that at the
moment of turning on the cock to tight
the gas Mrs. Clark must have been sud
denly taken with heart f.iilure or a faint
ing spell. She may have been; there for
hour* inhaling the deadly gas, for there
is no knowledge when she last left her
bed. .-,-. J. y/r--. '*..- rr-yry. -m
The deceased was a native of Michigan,
aged 29 years, and surviving her, besides
the grief-stricken husband, are two sons,'
aged 9 and 7 years. Her husband is of the'
firm of N. Clark & Sons, who conduct the
extensive i pottery works Â» in Alameda and
also in Sacramento. Mrs. Clark was from

WHY MERCY IS
ASKED FOR WORDEN
Governor Budd Petitioned
by the American Rail
way Union.
. r
_________________ T
i
It Presents Ten Reasons as
Sufficient for His Com
mutation.
Committeemen Crossley and- Harry
Knox Plead for the Con
vie Life.
The following communication has been
forwarded to Governor Budd by a commit
tee of the American Railway Union:
We favor the commutation of the sentence
of S. D. Worden, who was convicted of causing
the train wreck near Sacramento In Jul*-*,
1894, and sentenced to be haugea June 4,
1897
Firstâ lf we, the A. R. U. No. 345 of San
Francisco, Cal., are allowed we can produce
the affidavits ot at least six witnesses who
were called upon the next day after the wreck
by the parties who claimed to have wrecked
the train and asked for money to get out of
the countryâ and It was not Worden.
Secondâ We can also produce the confession
of the same parties in writing, whose feelings
were so worked up after leaving the country
to think that an innocent man was to be
hanged for the crime that tney committed,
â¢hat they wrote to Sacramento, thinking that
this would go to clear S. D. Worden of a crime
he never committed.
Thirdâ He (Worden) was permitted to waive
his legal rights, being kept drunk right alone,
evidently for a purpose and in the interest of
the prosecution by corrupt collusions with
officials. Without such collusions, a man in
jail could not get access to liquor. * Â«%,
Fourthâ Had he been guilty, if there is any
thing in the adage -'Vino Veritas." he would
surely have blurted it out, lor he seemed to be
chronically indiscreet. If he were in his right
mind he would hardly have acted the way he
did to the extent of signing a confession, or of
making one statement to his lawyer and
another to the prosecution. â¢
Filthâ who were tried for the same
crime, ana who, it Worden is guilty, are also
guilty, were acquitted upon practically the
6ame"evidence.
Sixthâ Although further evidence In Wor
den's favor had been obtained after his trial a
rehearing was denied by the Supreme Court
on technical grounds. Such grounds should
never cut any figure where a man's life is at
stake. '.â â¢â¢*'*.
Seventhâ The principal witness against
Worden was a youth in a state of destitution,
discovered by the railroad agents.who Induced
him to testily falsely. Although admittedly
guilty of the grossest perjury, he was allowed
to leave the court against the protests of the
attorneys lor the defense, when his detention
might have unearthed a plot to convict an
innocent man.
Immediately after Ills conviction S.
D. Worden was placed in solitary confinement
and denied any communication with the out
side world. The public good required no
such course, and the fact that it was adopted
is presumptive evidence that the prosecution
did not have a good case and were determined
to hang him, whether Innocent or guilty, as
an awful example.
Ninthâ eminently conservative and
law-abiding citizens as ex-President Cleveland
and C. P Huntington favor Worden's commuta
tion because they believe he was insane. This
attitude on the part of C. P. Huntington indi
cates that Worden's vindictive prosecution was
not prompted by the railroad magnates them
selves, but thatitwus the result of superser
viceab.eness on the part of detectives in the
railroad's employ who cared more to confirm
a Theory and thereby advance themselves than
to find the real criminal.
Tenthâ the circumstances we believe
that Worden's execution would be judicial
jpurder in the first degree.
Therefore, we beg and plead to our honora
ble Governor to please commute S. D. Worden's
seutence, no matter whet the confessions
the poor half-witted man might have made to
Set his whisky and drugs which have about
put his neck in the noose. And we call upon
all citizens to please to see if justice can be
done this man. George J. Crossley,
Harry a. Knox,

TEE ENDEAVOEEKS.
Slate Bailies Discussed â An Icecream
â  and Strawberry Social.
The church section of the Christian En
deavor convention reception committee
held a njeeting . on Monday afternoon at
the Y. 3J. C. A. building. The chairman.
Miss I. M. Clayton, presided, and there
was a good attendance. This section will
have entire charge of the State rallies to
be held in the various churches on Satur
day evenine, July 10. These State rallies
bave always proved to be some of the
most interesting meetings of all the con
vention.
The raising of funds to meet these and
other like expenses on the part of the
various Christian Endeavor societies is
disclosing the fact i hat considerable in
genuity is necessary in order to d-vise
some new and pleasing form of entertain
ment. The society of the First Congrega
tional Church will give a unique and
pleasant entertainment in the parlors of
the church on Friday evening of this
week. It is to be a strawberry and ice
cream festival, and everything about the
rooms will be in keeping with the name.
The decorations will combine the cream
and strawberry color?. The dresses of ihe
waitresses will be made to represent the
prevailing characteristic of the evening's
entertainment, and the refreshments will
consist of luscious berries plentifully
garnished with delicious icecream. The
early part of the evening will be filled in
with an excellent musical programme,
the California Quartet; a number of the
member** of Pro.essor Charles G. Graeber's
Mandolin Club, an organization which
comrrises about sixty pieces and uses
mandolins, guitars, banuurrias and other
familiar instruments, and Mrs. Susie
Hert-Mark being among those who bave
consented to assist in the musical portion
of the programme. In addition Miss Lot
lie J. Graeber will read several selections
and Dr. G. C. Stallman will recite. The
price of admission, is merely nominalâ lo
cents â and tickets are to be had at Dodge's.

DURRANT'S
CLOSING
APPEAL
Respite Asked That He Be
Tried in the Wil
liams Case.
MORE CLAIMS OF FRESH
EVIDENCE.
Governor Budd Expects to Give
His Decision on Sat*
urday.
MRS. DURRANT LABORS WITH
MRS. BUDD.
The Mother of the Condemned Inter
cedes With the Mother of the Gov
ernor for H^r Son.
The attorneys for Durrant have turned
the last stone in his behalf. Their final
appeal to Governor Budd for the con
demned man was a request that a respite
be granted in order that the prisoner may
ba tried for the murder of Minnie Wil
liams. Then, if he is again found guilty,
the lawyers say they will be content to
see him suffer death.
This, in brief, was the burden of the
petition presented to Governor Budd yes
terday by Attorneys John H. Dickinson
and Eugene N. Deuprey. For three hours
the Governor listened, while the two law
yers proceeded to lay before him the case
of their client as far as he is concerned
with the death of Minnie Williams. The
two cases are so inseparably connected, so
much alike in their general details, that
they were willing to concede that the two
murders were committed oy the same pair
of hands. There was doubt in the minds
of many, said the lawyers, that Durrant
murdered Blanche Lamont Theref6re,
they were willing to stake their fortunes on
a trial of the second case.
Governor Budd gave the lawyers an
audience continuing over three hours. |
Instead of going to him, the Governor
went to them. The conference began at 2
o'clock in the private office of General
John H. Dickinson and was a star-cham
ber affair. Even the faithful H. A. Tubb,
who of late has been making a good deal
of noise in Durrani's behalf, was denied
admittance and wailed the whole after
noon in an anteroom while his principal
wrestled for the life of the prisoner. Gen
eral Dickinson opened matters by first
informing the Governor that he had
evidence that he believed would acquit
Durrant of the murder of Minnie
Williams. He had refrained from
making public the particulars of it for
professional reasons. Forthwith Dickinson
proceeded to develop his case and the Gov
ernor was given in some detail an outline
of what the defense would have been had
the Minnie Williams case been tried first.
Chief of Police Lees and District Attorney
Barnes have always contended that the
evidence against Durrant is stronger in
this case than in that of Blanche Lamont.
Tnis was emphasized by both Dickinson
and Deuprey in their argument. They,
too, possessed evidence in their client's
behalf of a strong nature that they were
unable to secure in the Lamont case.
The development of the crank element
of late in connection with the case was
seized upon by Deuprey as an object
lesson to illustrate the influence of news
paper reports to distort the imagination
of weak-minded people, and while not
laying any stress upon such matters as
the declaration of" Convict Rosenberg,
Deuprey declared they served the purpose
of showing that people have taken
either side of the case with utter inconsist
ency. Continuing, he said, there were
many people prone to believe Durrant
guilty in spite of any proof of the oppo
site.
TJ-.e conference closed at 5:30 o'clock.
The Governor took with him notes of all
he had heard, which he will ponder over
at his leisure. Attorney Tubb delivered
to him a written request from Durrant for
an interview. The Governor, however,
has set his foot against any programme
that will bring him into 'contact with
either the condemned or his parent-. The
elder Durrant maoe an earnest but vain
endeavor to secure a hearing in the morn
ing.
The Governor devoted the morning to
an examination of the court exhibits in
the Blanche Lamont case. He called at the
office of Chief of Police Lees at 9 o'clock
and spent three hours looking over the
clothing of the dead girl, the chisel, pad
lock and other articles that were pre
sented to the jury at the trial. This
morning he will leave for Sacramento and
begin to prepare his decision. Possibly
be will not be able to reach it until Satur
day. He has still a good deal of the testi
mony to read. Besides he will again re
view the transcript filed in the Supreme
Court.
As the day of her son's execution draws
near Mrs. Durrant redoubles her efforts in
his behalf. During her visit to Mrs. Budd,
the mother of the Governor, in Stockton
on the preceding day Mrs. Durrani was
told that Mrs. Dr. Freeman of 122 Turk
(street possessed some important informa
tion.
Mrs. Budd had told her Mrs. Freeman,
who was formerly a resident of Stockton,
was acquainted with a man who bore a
remarkable resemblance to the con
demned young man; and that moreover,
he had admitted that he had occupied a
seat in the Powell-street car with Blanche
Lamont on her return from the Normal

SECRETARY LYNCH DEFENDS PASTOR- GIBSON'S
ACTIONS.
San Francisco, May 26, .1897.
I take this means of correcting certain misrepresentations of Dr. Gibson.
Certain persons have selected different remarks made by him, and by miscon
struction and false use have drawn deductions that are wrong. :i;>;V
Dr. Gibson's position is so clear that it 'scarcely needs stating, yet the
sensational stories and cranks' vagaries have tended to throw some sort of a
suspicion on him. All suspicions as to the doctor's connection with the crime
itself are, of course, readily dissolved in the light of his complete and clear alibi.
This fact should be sufficient to keep an impartial paper from giving publicity to
groundless stories. â¢ "
It is very strange that our efforts to be kind to the accused by not expressing
any opinion as to his guilt, and persuading our people to do likewise, should be
the subject of so much censure from the defense. Because the doctor will not
say that Theodore Durrant is guilty,. various wise attorneys profess to believe
that we are conscious of his innocence. , Â ,',
Dr. Gibson has no bad feeling against Durrant. Before the tragedy Dur
rant treated the minister like a gentleman. His lawyers and friends, however,
have been working against the preacher for more than two years. The minis
ter's silence at first was construed against him, and now his speech is receiving
the same treatment. Our present attitude is simply one of defense. If Durrant
had not been an enemy to Dr. Gibson from the very start he might have re
ceived much consolation and assistance from the preacher. ' The latter's pres
ence and sympathy would have been freely given to the prisoner if any friendly
overtures had been made. . This explains the remark about the advisability of
Deuprey making us friends rather than enemies. -V ~:'- '*'", '." '
Zach Montgomery presented an exceedingly illogical and unfair treatment of
the doctor's statement in another journal. The gentleman's inferences were
beautiful, but entirely faise. Dr. Gibson never realized that he had any right
to express his opinion as to any man's guilt before he was tried or the evidence
sifted. â¢
The doctor's answers on the witness-stand suited the questions asked. He
had no opinions to volunteer. He simply answered the questions. His silence
as to other things did not partake of the nature suggested by. Mr. Montgomery.
The doctor was astounded when, after having borne a shower of criticism for
silence, he should have been picked out by the defense as the one who
would make the best enemy.
Considering the influence the defense used against the preacher, he would
have been justified in using his influence against Durrant. Being a preacher he
decided not to use any influence, but to let the plans against himself go on with
out one unkind word. In his hope that insinuation would cease, he insisted on
Durrant's name being retained on the church books. It was not a question of
guilt or innocence, but one of Christian spirit.
There is no occasion for Dr. Gibson having a bad spirit against Durrant.
He has nothing but sorrow in his heart that any one should be in the position of
the accused. Bad feeling is out of the question, for the matter is not a personal
one and never can be.
Dr. Gibson is not ashamed to say he never volunteered information. In his
position all kinds of stories and suggestions came to him, as well as invitations
to follow up hints, but he never paid any attention. He issued no stories, he
inspired no such tales as those which have been inspired against himself.
Dr. Gibson has no connection with the crimes, has no personal feeling
against the defendant and no occasion to express his opinion. But if the attor
neys continue in their present course to make personal attacks on the doctor's
character I shall feel called upon to draw from the richness of my knowledge as
to the character of the accuser.
School on the day preceding her disap
pearance.
Mrs. Durrant evidently deemed this
story of enough importance to call on
Mrs. Freeman early yesterday morning.
The woman did not reveal her identity,
and Mrs. Freeman believed she was en
tertaining a newspaper reporter at the
time. Later, when she learned who her
visitor was, she was not pleased at the
imposition.
The story, however, proved to be of the
rainbow sort, so far as it had any connec
tion with the case. Mrs. Freeman said
last night Mrs. Budd had trot things all
twisted. As far as she was .concerned
Mrs. Freeman said she believed its only
foundation consisted in the fact that two
years ago there was a clerk in
the Mansion House in Stockton named
William Meelcen who resembled Durrant
somewhat and gained some local notoriety
on this account. If the hotel clerk knew
either Blanche Lamont or Minnie Wil
liams Mrs. Freeman could not say. She
heard in a roundabout manner that he
had ridden with a young lady on a Powell
street car about the time of the murder.
Chief Lees has had a strong suspicion
that W. T. Bryant, the man in the Soldiers'
Home, Monte Vista, Colo., was an old
crook, and last night, he says, his sus
picions were confirmed.
Bryant, according to the Chief, is none
other than Sid Brown, who is known as
a crook all over the State, and has served
most ot his lifetime in the penitentiary.*;
Several ot his pictures are in the
"rogues' gallery" at police headquarters,
and last night Mrs. Craw and her daughter,
who live at 279 Jessie street, positively
identified them as those of their roomer,
Bryant, alias Duval, he having lived with
them for some time.
"Sid Brown," said Chief Lees last night,
"is the biggest liar in the United States,
and he has always borne that reputation.
Of course, I knew that his statement about
Blanch Lamont was a lie from beginning
to end, and it did not need the knowledge
that he is Sid Brown, the prince of liars,
to convince me of that fact"
His record, as given by Chief Lees, is as
follows: A native of England ; occupa
tion, florist; now 62 years ot age; as John
Brown, alias Sid Brown, sentenced to
three years on December 13, 1851, for
grand larceny, in El Dorado County; as
William Bryant, sentenced to ten years
for grand larceny, in Yuba County, in
December, 1854, escaped from the peni
tentiary December 27, 1854; enlisted at
Sacramento as William T. Br van De
cember 12, 1864. in Company X, Second
Regiment of Cavalry, deserted at Camp
Union, Cal., March 9, 1865, returned May
8, 1865; mustered out at Camp Union May
18. iÃ6&3iagq '
On November 23. 1867, as W. Bryant
he was sentenced to two years for grand
larceny in San Bernardino; November
24, 1879, as A. J. Crittenden, sentenced to
two years for. burglary in Los Angeles;
November 17, 1883, as H. A. Pellissier
sentenced to four years and six months
lor burglary and grand larceny in Ala
meda, and on November 13, 1888. as W. T.
Bryant he was sentenced to five years for
burglary in this City and was discharged
on June 13. 1892.
NEARING THE FATAL DAY.
Theodore Durrant Soon to Occupy
the Death Chamber.
SAN QuENTIN; PRISON, Cal., May
26.â The day is drawitiK near when Theo
dore Dnrrant will be taken from the
ceil which be has occupied in murderers'
row and led to the chamber of death on
the top story of the great red building
that was once used as the furniture fac
tory. When he enters here he will be un
able to commit self-destruction, if the
idea has ever entered his mind. Night
and day every movement will be watched.
Slowly the days have passed and yet no
reprieve has come. Tne -time' before the
youthful murderer will be taken to the
condemned cell has narrowed down to
hours. It was not long ago- that Frank
Kloss spent his last hours there and now
itisDurrant's; turn. There will" fee . but
three prisoners left in murderers' row
when Durrant leaves.
Attorney Tubb visited the prison again
to-day. He was here yesterday and in
his talk with the man who is condemned
to die on the 11th of June, be informed
him of all that was being done in his be
half. ; The, appeal to the Governor, the
stories of confession and the evidence that
has been presented, have been told to the
prisoner, who lives in hopes that his ap
peal to Governor Budd to come and see
him and ~ listen . to what â¢he has to ex
plain in his own behalf will be granted.
: It Jis a relief from the everyday life of
those in murderers' row to have visitors.'
Then ; they are taken from the dark, tor
bidding cells on the first tier of the prison
building, and accompanied by guards led

flowers and witness the life and animation
that is everywhere evident, but not for an
instant are they beyond the clutches of
the guards.
Cell 21 is the abiding place of Theodore
Durrant, and except lor a few hours when
he is allowed to exercise himself in the
prison yard in the afternoon with the
other condemned men, he is confined in
the cell, and the only light he receives is
through two openings about six inches in
length and one inch in width.
Durrant will enter the condemned cell
in about a week unless something extra
ordinary occurs. He does not believe that
he will be hanged on June 11, and the long
talks he has with his attorneys keep the
tire of hope alive in bis breast. '
MRS. BUDD'S GRACE ASKED
Mrs. Durrant Appeals to the Gov-**
ernor's Mother In Behalf
of Her Son.
* STOCKTON, Cal., May 26.â Mrs. Dur
rant, the mother of Theodore Durrant,
whose only hope now lies with Governor
Budd, called upon Mrs. Judge Budd, the
mother of the chief executive, yesterday
afternoon for the purpose of enlisting her
sympathies in behalf of her condemned
son.
The real object of the unfortunate
mother's visit was to have Mrs. Judge
Budd intercede for the commutation of
Durrant's sentence to life imprisonment,
although she did not say in so many
words that such was her mission. She
did not request or suggest that Mrs.
Budd should intercede with the Governor,
but had evidently hoped that by winning
the sympathies of the mother of the Gov
ernor Mrs. Budd would of tier own accord
appeal to her son as only a mother can.
Mrs. Durrant kept her mission a secret,
and hence very few people knew that she
paid Stockton a visit. She arrived on the
1 :08 train from San Francisco and went
directly to the Budd house. She re
mained with Mrs. Budd until it was time
to take the 3:40 train on her return to the
metropolis, spending about two hours as
one mother appealing to another for the
life Â« I her only son.
"Mrs. Durrant is a refined little woman,
entirely different from what I imagined,
for you know one will form opinions,"
said Mrs. Budd. "She controlled herself
wonderfully. She did I not go into tears
once, but acted most bravely. I did all \
the crying myself. Mrs. Durrant ex
plained to me when she came that she
had not come to make a scene nor to
annoy we, but wanted to talk to me as
one mother; to another. She knew, she
said, that I being a mother would listen
to her when others would not. She said
that the Governor had denied her an
; audience. She did not blame him for not
wanting to see her, because she supposed
that he had concluded that she would beg,
implore arid weep for her son. That, 'she
said, was far from her intention, and she
demonstrated it in her conduct yesterday.
"Ah she desired was to save her son's
lifeâ to have the death sentence commuted
to life imprisonment, or any expedient
whatever that might give him a lease of
life. She believes firmly in his innocence,
as what mother would not believe her son
innocent? She described how he had
been a model boy ail his life-â a regular
mother's boy. He was 'proud and ambi
tious, and the mother cannot believe that
he turned fiend in a day. I don't think
it is possible, either. The boy ; has cer
tainly had the * advantage, of â  a careful
rearing, and home culture.
"The interview; just made- me sick,"
said Mrs. Budd in conclusion.' "I did not
sleep a bit all night over it. -i I knew Mis.
Durrant was coming; I knew it lor the
last four or five days. T don't know how,'
but 1 just fell that si's .would call upon
me. They all do. 0 ..',' my! I bars let
ters and letters urging ___ to appeal to the

It seems as though everybody in trouble
appeals to me." They write to me and call
upon me personally. . v

mutation to life sentence In order .to give
those who are working for Theodore an op

THERE WAS
POISON IN
THEIR FEED
Over Thirty Horses in the
What Cheer Stables -
Suffered.
FIVE OF THE NUMBER
HAVE DIED.
The Remainder Are Still Under
Treatment b? Dr. I. W.
O'Rourke.
ALL ARE VERY SHAKY ON
THEIR LEGS.
A Mysfe y Hangs Around the AflFj'r
and the Harbor Police Are In*
vestigating.
For the last few days the What Cheer
stables, on Jackson street, near Davis,
have resembled a veterinary hospital.
Over thirty horses have been sick for four
days, and during that time five have died.
Just whom the blame can be laid upon is
in doubt, but every employe of Jacobs
Bros, assarts that the feed was poisoned.
Not a horse escaped and those that are
now alive were only saved by t be unre
mitting attention of Dr. I. W. O'Rourke.
It appears that last Sunday a new con
signment of crushed barley was distrib
uted among the various bins and the
evening meal was served to the horses
from it. The next day every animal was
sick. They had all the symptoms of
arsenical poisoning and the veterinary
was at once summoned. In spite of all
his efforts a hor.-e owned by J. H. Kane &
Go., the commission merchant; another
by T. Murray, the well-known boarding
house master; a third by Middleton &
Co., the grocers; a fourth by W. Schuitz,
the wholesale liquor merchant, and a fifth
by John Lubbin, all died. Tbe others
have been watched day and night and
now nearly all of them are out of danger.
All the animals are being treated for a
corrosive poison. Every hour they are led
from their own stalls into what the
stablemen call "the medicine chest"
There they are dosed with linseed
tea and other drugs. The operation is
a simple one. The horse is backed into a
stall and securely tied up. A running
noose is let down from the roof and the
animal's upper lip is enclosed in it As
soon as everything is fast a man on the
other end of the' rope begins to pull, and
in a few minutes the horse's head is in the
air with his mouth wide open. Then the
medicine is poured down his throat
Hour after hour the procession goes on.
Two men are kept constantly at work pre
paring the tea and two mors are con
stantly filling quart-bottles from the
buckets. Another man leads the horses
from their stalls, and still another ad
ministers the medicine.; There is not an
idle man in the What Cheer stables these
days. All the horses seem to be affected
in the legs. They walk as if they had
corns, but their general condition could
not be noted as each animal was
blanketed. ' All of them that are left seem
to be improving/and, judging from the
care that is being bestowed on them, no
more deaths will follow.
"The whole affair is a mystery to me,"
said Mr. Jacobs yesterday. "We have not
an enemy in the world, and how the feed
came to be poisoned I don't know. Four
of the horses have died, but I think all
the others will recover. ; The first meal
given to the horses made . them all sick.
When I say the first meal I mean the first
meal from the new feed. It came direct
from the mills and was mixed in the sta
ble, so just how the stuff that poisoned
the horses was put in is a mystery that
the police will have to unravel."
The matter has been reported at the
Harbor Police station and detectives are
now at 'â { work on the case. . Twice a day
Dr. O'Rourke goes to see the horses, and
he says that all that are left are out of
danger. He also advised the Jacobs Bros,
to say nothing about the matter until the
police had had time to look into it Sus
picions point in one direction and devel
opments are expected. -
Murray's horse was one of the best-known
of its kind on the water front, and was as
intelligent as a human being. Middle
ton's gray was known from Mei/jgs wharf
to the Mail dock, and Kane & Co.'s bay
could be trusted to find Washington
street wharf alone any day in the week.
Scnultz's hors-j was a pacer and was well
known in the parte, while Lubbin's was a
steady old roadster that never moved out
of a jog trot. J.'-r '">â¢- .J... -.-â¢'-.'
