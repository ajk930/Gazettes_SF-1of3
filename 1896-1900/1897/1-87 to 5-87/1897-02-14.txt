BERLIN. Germany, Feb. 13.â The pol- |
icy of Germany in regard to Crete, ac- i
ciniing to direct authority from the For
eign Ottice, is strict adherence to the
course agreed upon by the concert of pow- i
ers recently established in respect to Tur- '
key, and it is furtner announced upon the j
same authority that Germany particularly i
stands by the side of Austria, and will
support Austria's lead in the present
crisis.
This official declaration, made concur
rent with the declaration of Baron Banffy,
the Hungarian Premier, in the Hungarian
Chamber of Deputies to-day, that there
was no foundation for the report that the
Austro-Kungarian army was being mo
bilized, which became Known here late
this afternoon, may have the effect to par
tially allay the existing alarms, but only
partially, as the advices received from
many quarters point out that war is in
evitable.
.both Greece and Turkey are hurryin-r
forward troops to the frontiers of Thessalia
with the utmost dispatch, ami everything
in the vicinity of the Thessalonian borders
bears a warlike aspect. German military
officers who have served in the Turkish
army agree that Turkey could over
whelm Greece on land in a very short
time. Some idea of the military activity
of Turkey may be gathered from the fast
that twenty-two Macedonia battalions
have received orders to march to Tnes
salonia, and the Albanian Argonauts have
been ordered out and eight battalions of
ftedifs irom Asia Minor have been sum
moned for duty in Thesaalia. It is esti
mated that within a fortnight Turkey
will hare together an army sufficiently
strong for a successful invasion of Greece
if the powers do not in the meantime
interfere, which it is perfectly plain Greece
expects them to do. It is probable that
the powers will allow Turkey to make a

it ia not at all likely that she will be per
mitted to go any further. One mine,
however, is perfectly clear, and that Â£
that any invasion of Greece by Turkey,
whether it shall be followed by tue de eat
of the Greeks or the repulse of the in
vaders, will be the signal for a rising in
Macedonia and a general Balkan war.
Most of the Berlin newspapers are
mildly sympathetic with Greece and
Crete. The Berlin Post, however, takes a
contrary view of the situation, and in an
article on the subject &ays: "Surely the
powers will refuse to allow a rich island
and the key to the .r'jjean Sea to be ac
quired 1 by an unworihy slate like Greece,
it would be better to make Crete tributary,
but independent like Samoa."
According to adv.ces received here from
Russia the military authories in the Cau
casus and Odessa districts have received
orders from St. Pete-sburg to mobilize
their force and are now ready to embark
from Odessa an estimated force of 27,000
men. Including the Sebastopol and Nico
laieff detachments this would make a
body of 37,000 men ready for instant ser
vice in the field. In addition to the.-c
preparations transport ships with full
steam up are ready to embark and get
under way within a few hours. If an ex
pedition from Odessa should be decided
upon it would land at Scutari.
Premier Banffy, in denying in the Hun
garian Chamber to-day that the Austro-
Hungarian army was being mobilized,
neglected to mention the fact which is
well-known here tuat the officials manag
ing the Austro-Hungarian Southern Rail
way have given instructions by telegraph
to all stations to have everything in readi
ness at twenty-four hours' notice to assist
in mobilizing and dispatching troops and
munitions of war.

about the Austro-Hnngarisn army being
mobilized is without foundation. The
trouble in Crete, he said, was due partly
to agitation by Greek committees and
partly to delay in carrying out reforms in
administration of tbe'affairs of the island
which had been conceded by the Sultan.
Greece, the Premier further said, had acted
in the matter against the advice of the
powers who had agreed absolutely upon
the necessity of maintaining peace and
the status quo in the East.

live together in harmony, and that some
thine will shortly have to be done by the
powers to prevent the periodical recur

which mark the outbreaks on the island.
It has looked for two days as though an
armed conflict between Turkey and
Greece was inevitable, the latter country

I of the Cretan Christians being determined
to prevent at all cost the landing ia Crete
[ of Turkish troops to re-enforce those ai
! ready there. The Greeks generally look
upon Crete as being by right part of the
Grecian domains, and they are wildly en
| thusiastic over the pending dispute,
j which promises to demand the interven
tion of the powers with the result of the
ultimate annexation of the island by
Greece.
It was reported from Constantinople
yesterday that the Turkish Government
took a very gloomy view of the situation,
and that, in fact, it has notified the pow
ers that it would not send any re-enforce
ments to Crete.
The exact rea son for this decision is no
known, but it is pretty certain that had
extra troops been sent to the island their
landing would have been opposed by the
Greek torpedo flotilla, which is under the
cpramand of Prince George, the second
son of the King of Greece. Lord Salis
bury was informed to this effect yester
day by the Greek Charge d'Affaires.
Considerable reliance is placed on the
scheme of M. Hanotaux, the French
Foreign Minister, for the settlement of
the trouble. As stated in the United
Associated Presses dispatches yeÂ«terdny
this scheme provides for the blockade of
Crete by the Dowers and the occupation of
the principal centers. This would pre
vent the Christians from obtaining arms,
ammunition and re-enforcements, which
is well known are constantly arriving
from the mainland. If it be true, as is
sail, that the scheme includes the ulti
mate occupation or the island by Greece,
under the governorship of Prince George,
with the Cretans still paying their annual
tribute to the Porte, it is thought that the
question can be settled on these lines or
in a way very similar.
The outcome is exciting the keenest in
terest and popular sympathy is with the
Christians, though there is no doubt that
in the present troubles they were the ag
gressors.

PARIS, France, Feb. 13.â 1n an article
on the situa ion in Crete the Gau'.ois
says that the King of Greece when in Paris
November last gave the Government to
understand that his further resistance to
the aspirations of Greece was impossible
and he was compelled therefore to seek
closer relations with Austria and Great
Britain, the disposition of Russia being
unfriendly. The paper slbo asserts that a

the German Emperor made announcement
that he would adhere to the policy of

The above is a good specimen of the fleet

Gaulois concludes by warning Germany
that the question of Alsace-Lorraine will
not be lost sight of by France.
THE GHEt.K AFT.
It la Capable of Making a Good Showing
Â: Again*; Turkey..
Though inferior in numbers of vessels,
guns and men to that of Turkey, the
Greek navy is capable of making a good
showing if it comes to a clash on the
coasts of Crete. i:. : ,. :
Her navy comprises two port defense
Ironclad vesselsâ the Basilens Georgius,
1774 tons, carrying two 10- ton Kriippguns,'
with four light and two machine guns,
and having a speed of twelve knots, and
the Basilissu Ol R a, 2060 tons, has four 514
--ton and two 3^-ton Krupp guns and a
speed of ten knots; three steel cruisers,
the Hyda, the Spotsai ana the Psura, 4885
tons each, built in France at the forges
and chuntiers of M. Canet. These vessels
have a speed of eighteen knots and are
protected by an over-all steel belt of 11.8
inches at the water line with another of
2.9 inches above. They were equipped at
the time of building each with three 10.6
--inch and four 5.9-inch Canet guns, besides
seven H-pounder quick-firing guns and
eighteen other smaller and machine guns.
The Greek Government decided in the
early part of last year to put in a supple
mentary armament, and cave the order to
M. Canet. The guns were finished and
delivered a short time aeo.
The superiority of the Canet system
over the Krupp and Armstrong has been so
thoroughly demonstrated that both France
I and Russia have adopted it
There arc also seventeen torpedo-boats
of late patterns, varying from B*3 to 115
feet in length, and twelve of smaller size.
She has besides these four unarmored
vessels, two corvettes of 1300 and 1800 tons
and two cruisers of 1000 tons each, be
sides twelve gunboats.
Every marine in the Greek navy is kept
up to a good standard of condition, and
the morale of the officers and men is most
excellent. There are 185 officers and
cadets, among whom is Prince George,
ranking as captain; 247 employes, 587
petty officers, 2146 engine-room men and
sailors. The term of service in the Greek
navy is two years, and there is a large re
serve of trained men to draw from in case
of need, to say nothing of her merchant
sailors, who are to be found on every ship
that sails the Mediterranean.

that the Vesuvius ran the blockade on the
first night that she joined the fleet, but
these are absolutely incorrect. An officei

blockading line v, as signaled from the
tiagships a bit earlier than usual. The
four ships then on duty â the battle-ship
Maine, flagship New York, battle-ship In
diana and cruiser Columbia â steamed to
the southward, taking positions at inter
vals ol 3000 yards.
Shortly alter 6 o'clock the Vesuvius
drew away to the south also aud was soon
lost in the fog. The weather had been
bad for several days, and asni^bt came on
fog settled down iimn* the face of tbe
water that kept every fogbell out beyond
Sumter ringing.
At 7 o'clock the test was well begun.
The blockading ships brought their search
lights into play and it was then tor the
first time that they began to realiz â¢ how
small was their chance oi detecting the
Vesuvius. The lights, which usually
throw a brilliant path of raiii nice for 3000
yards over the water, proved utterly inad
equate to the task of penetrating the fog.
Objects 300 yards away could scarcely be
distinguished with the aid of the most
powerful of the searchlights, and wnen it
is remembered th:it the ships were 3000
yards apart it will be readily imagin d
that the Vesuvius had everything pretty
much her own way.
She had gone several miles to sea and
then returned. As she approached the
blockading line all of her lights were
shroudec and order^ were given in hushed
tones The little cruiser can, under favor
able circumstances, make a little better
than twenty-two knots, but slie did not
tax her capacity last night. Her engines
were brought down to a normal speed,
and heading in between two of the fleet
she ran straight into the harbor without
an iota of troubl â .
Ail due precautions which had been
taken to escape detection were useless,

ton was undertaken in 1861.
for in that fog she could have come in
quite as well with all her lights going and
never been seen. The matter was made
very light of on the fleet to-day, and it
was claimed that the test could not be
counted as a fair one. It is true that only
four ships were on duty, the Amphitrite
and Marblehead being in port, and it is
likewise true that the night was fa
vorable to the blockade - runner ; but
it might be observed that were the Vesu
vius a real blockade-runner she would
probably have selected 6uch weather for
the expedition, and Admiral Bunce knew
ho did not have but four of his ships in
line when he gave the Vesuvius her orders.
The Ye-uvius seems to have demonstrated
fairly well on the whole that four of Uncle
Sam's best ships would not be able to
keep a biockader out of Charleston harbor.
All she would have to do would b? to wait
for a heavy fog and to run in between the
lines. The result of the attempt to be
made at night was awaited with interest.
The battle-shio Massachusetts joined the
fleet to-day and the Amphitrite has re
sumed her place in the line. The attempt
was consequently made with six snips in
action. Tue weather was clear and con
ditions were far more propitious for the
fleet.
The cruiser Vesuvius made five unsuc
cessful attempts to run the blockade to
night. The conditions were exactly re
versed from la>t night, as the air was free
from fog or mist and the searchlights
worked perfectly. For a stretch of nine
miles the waters of the Atlantic in front
of Charleston harbor bristled with Uncle
Sam's flying forts and gleamed wiih the
restless arrows of dozens of searchlights.
From the Beacii channel on the north to
Pumpkin Hill channel on the south the
fleet held the line in the following order:
Massachusetts, Maine, Amphitrite, New
York, Indiana and Columbia. The line
was established at 7 o'clock and the Vesu
vius was sent out to sea.
The searchlights began at once to play
over the waters. It was about 7:35 when
a light from the Maine stopped its wan
derings and streamed along steadily upon
one point. The cause was soon known.
Bhe had caught the Vesuvius. A red and
green signal told the tale, and the
lights of the fleet turned upon the spot
brought the white hull of the cruiser into
fuli view. The Vesuvius put up her lights
fore and aft and went to sea again for
another trial. The next time ehe got past
the line and was nearly out of danger
when the lights of the Amphitrite caught
her.
Three other attempts were made, and
each time the blockade-runner was quickly
caught.
Commander Pillsbury handled the Ve
euvius with consummate skiil, but the
lights were too many for him.

BLOCKADE OF CHARLESIOS.
Thim Ib Tlay Compared to Bunee'g Work
in Patt Warfare.
The institution of the blockade of
Charleston harbor is now fairly under
way, and though not quite so agreeable as
lying in a snug harbor, Admiral Bunce
without doubt finds "going through the
motions" in this February, 1897, very dif
ferent from the real work in which as the
lieutenant-commander of the ironclad
steamer Catskill, a member of the South
Atlantic squadron, he was engaged in
February, 1864. Now it is friendly
maneuvering to detect any attempt on the
part of a few well-known members of the
same squadron, with whose shape, color
and cut every apprentice- boy in the
squadron is entirely familiar, to slip in
through one of the several channels lead-
Ing to the inner harbor. Then it was to
bo cover an arcof acircle some thirty miles
in length as to not only block the way into
any one of some ten channels by whicti
the deeper-draught vessels could get over
the bar, but practically over its whole
stretch, as many of the daring blockade
runners were specially constructed for the
work, and to draw so little water as to be
able to cross at almost any point.
Painted a light neutral tint not easily
distinguished from the water even by day
these craft could choose there own time â
rainy and dark nights all the better, and
vlth every light out approach the guard
circle, seiect the widest interval between
the blockaders, step in between them and
over the bar at a speed of some fifteen
knots to the protection of the Confederate
guns. Their coming was always expected
and range-lights to guide them were
burned every nierht from the steeples in
the city and on Castle Pinclcney and Fort
Riplry in the harbor and Sumter and
Moultrie at its mouth. Once inside they
reaped rich rewards for their hazardous
enterprise.
The mouth of Charleston harbor is en
circled by a bar extending from above
Long Island on the north to some dis
tance below Lighthouse Inlet on the
south. The mean low water on this bar
varies from fourteen to sixteen feet with
shoals in various places. Several chan
nels affording at least fifteen feet of water
lead from deepwater outside across it to
tbe deepwater inside.
During the time of the real blockade the
principal channels were: The Beach, on
the north, running near the shores of
Long & Sullivan's Islands; the North
Channel, just below it, running more
directly east; the Swash, next below, the
shortest of all three, and some miles below
the Pumpkin Hill Channel, leading across
the bar to the main ship channel, which
ran along Morris Island. These were the
ones in general use at the beginning of the
war, and were shown on the charts; bat
there were numerous others well known
to the pilots about Charleston, but not to
the officers of the blocKading squadron.
They wound around the devious courses
made by the sualtows, but were safe enough
for skillful pilots on the light-draft
blockade-runners, with the numerous
fixed liehts on shore to guide them. The
blockaders cou d not follow, nor could
they lay close to the bar on account of the
currents and tides, whicn mi :ht carry
them into the breakers and to certain
destruction. Then, too, they had to keep
well out of range of the Confederate gans,
which cover* d a large section of tne bar.
The bar and its channels are subject to
natural changes, and since the time of the
real blockades jetties have been con
structed ami dredging work done which
throw the North Channel and the Swash
into one, which is the most used, especi
ally by vessels approaching from the
north and east. On t c south two chan
nels, the Pumptin Hill and the New
Pumpkin Hiil afford passage over to the
main ship channel. These are well
buoyed, and beacon lights on the shore
just north of Lighthouse Inlet, offer good
landmarks. It is here that the evolutions
of Admiral Bunce's squadron are being
conducted.
W r hile the blockade grew to be so effec
tive toward the end of the war that not
one vessel in five succeeded in getting
through, the returns from that one repaid
the owners on the whole, and tney kept
at it until the last. The beach channel
was their favorite course, as they could
sooner get into shallow water, where the

blockaders conld not follow, and undÂ«r
the guns of the forts on Sullivan's Island.
Many a rich prize was taken at the en
trance of this channel and many a vessel
beached to prevent capture, which was de
stroyed by the gund of the fle-t. On Feb
ruary 2, 1864, the richly freighted steamer
Presto was seen lying near Fort Moultrie,
having crept in during the night. The
monitors went near and opened on her at
2500 yards with their rifled guns and soon
destroyed her. Millions of dollars were
lost every year to the British owners in
this manner, and the powers of resistance
of the Confederate Government most
seriously hurt by this blockade.
Early in the war an attempt was made
to lessen the work of the fleet by sinking
ve-sels loaded with stone across the Beach
and main ship channel?. This did not
prove successful, however, and the vigil
ance of the officers and men had to be
kept up from the summer of '61 till the
end of February, 1865. When all V7as
finished and they reached the city there
was no grand ball to welcome them,
tnough tney were doubtless willing enough
to dispense with it as long as they were
not treated to balls of another kind.

Grosvenor's Sharp Rep yâ DeArmond
D- nouncjs Justice S'liras is
Vigorous Words.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. 13. -The
House to-day went into committee of the
whole to further consider the sundry
civil appropropriation bill, upon which it
had just entered when it adjourned yes
terday.
Cannon (R.) of Illinois, chairman of the
Committee on Appropriations, asked
unanimous consent that the bill might be
considered as read. Answering an in
ouiry, Cannon gave the status of the sev
eral remaining appropriation bills, and
intimated that if t c bill was considered
in the usual way the better fart of a week
would be re quired to dispose of it.
Hepburn objected to the unanimous
consent asked by Cannon, but after the
rending of the bill had proceeded a snort
time Dockery renewed the request that
the first readin of the bill be dispensed
with, and this time it was granted.
General debate was then began on the
measure under an arrangement which
contemplated the use of the afternoon
therefor. Cannon was the first speaker,
explaining in some detail the features of
the bill. In the coarse of bis statement
Cannon explained why the committee had
recommended an appropriation for cer
tain works authorized by the river and
harbor bill. These were: Oakland, Cat.,
$400,000; Kentucky R ver. $400,000; dams
2 ana 5, Ohio River, |400,000; Yakima
Bay, Cal., $100,000.
It appeared, he said, from inquiry at the
War Department that these, with one ex
ception, could not be completed within
the amoun ts named in the river and har
bor bill, to which the expenditure was
strictly limited, and, therefore, contracts
could not be made for their construction
or any money expended. The exception
was Yakima Bay, Cal., for which the
engineers had reported no project what
ever.
Hepburn antagonized the policy of in
cluding purely local river and harbor im
provements in the bill, charging that it
wa< a source of rutbiess and reckless ex
travagance of appropriations.
McMiilin (D.) of Tennessee, responding
to a statement by Hopkins (R ) of Il
linois that under a Republican adminis
tration oi the McKinley law it produced
revenues sufficient to meet the expendi
tures of the Government, with a surplus
i>â¬'ide-, criticized the decision of the
Supreme Court which made the income
tax feature of the Wilson law ineffective.
"Bui," he adiled, "the whole court
ought not to suffer for the action of one
man. Everybody knows that the njan
who tore down the constitution, uprooted
tiie decision of 100 years and destroyed
the power of the Government to tax the
wealth of the Government was' Kniras.
and his name should always be remem
bered in connection wi h that reprehen
sible and ever-to-be-criticized decision."
To this Grosvenor replied. He said he
should leave the criticiÂ«m of the Supreme
Court and of Mr. Bbiras, who could not
respond, to the gentleman from Tennes
see. He desired, however, to let the gen
i.eman have the full benefit of the propo
sition that the McKinley law was inade
quate as a revenue-raicer, and the Wilson
law was a splendid production. That
would strike the country as something re
markable.
The McKinley law, Grosvenor said, pro
auced not only sufficient revenue for the
expenditures of me Government, but a
surplus as well, until God, for some reason
which he has not made known, menaced
the future of the country by permuting
the elecuon of Grover Cleveland ana a
Democratic Congress.
DeArmond (D.) of Missouri referred to
Grosvenor's repiy to McMiliin's "just
criticism" of the Supreme Court in the
matter of the income decision, and said
i-e yielded to the decisions of the Suprem
Court that general respect which every
lawyer was taught was due to tbt> big est
tribunal of the Nation. "But," he con
tinued, "I belong to tuat class of people
nnd represent a constituency who do not
believe that any institution of the country
or any person or body enga eil in admin
istering the affairs of the Nation is so
sacred tbat it is not subject to just criti
cism. One of the greatest menaces to the
prosperity and progress ot th" Republic
lies in the u-urputions by the judiciary of
that subtle, never-ceasing power which
overturns the decisions of a hundred
years, affects the election of Presidents
and makes strange laws by strange meth
ods."
Speakingof the reported action of Jus
tice Bhiras UeArrnond said: "He changed
his mind in such a way as to lilt trorn
wealth a tax of from forty to sixty mil
lions a year and transfer it to poverty and
toil. Men may change their minds, but
when lorty to sixty millions annually are
in the scale and a trained Judge, without
further argument and additional light,
changes his mind, why should there not
be comment on it? His name will be
kept alive, not in honor, but because the
American people have been outraged by
him."
DeArmond closed with a fervid, impas
sioned appeal for intervention in behalf
of the Cuban revolutionists.
Cannon closed the general debate and
expressed tne opinion that it would be
wise to pass the bill under suspension of
the rules Monday, and be would test the
sense of the House on that point.
Tne committee arose and at 5:25 o'clock,
on motion by Cannon, the House ad
journed until Monday.
SENATE PttOCBEVIIiGB.
famine Jteli'f Resolution by Ttrkin* la
Promptly Patted
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 13.â
Senate to-day, without a question and
without a moment's consideration, passed
a joint resolution introduced by Perkins
(R.) of California, to have a naval vessel
placed at the disposal of the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce to transport wheat
and corn contributed by California, Oregon
and other States for thÂ» relief of the
famine-stricken poor of India.
Instead of a naval vessel the Secretary
of the Navy may charter a suitable Amer
ican steamship. The necessary appropri
ation is provided.
A resolution was offered by Petticrew
(Sil.)of South Dakota and agreed to di
rectine an inquiry tnto the issue of lanJ
patents on what is known as the Pcrritia
grant in Florida. This was an old claim
which Secretary of the Treasury Smith
refu-ed to recogmz 3 , but which the pres
ent Secretary has recognized, and as the
Perrine in question is related by marriage
to the PresiJent of the United "States no
tice is given to the inquiry that it might
not otherwiso raise.
An effort was made by Morgan to have
the business of the morning hour con
tinued so that he niiaht address the Sen
ate on the joint resolution introduced by
lum yesterday for tlie abrogation of the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty. The chairman of
the Foreign Relations Committee insisted
on a motion to proceed to executive busi
ness and a majority of tfie Senate sidea
with him, and so at 12:20 tne Senate re
sumed behind closed doors consideration
of tne arbitration treaty and at 4:45 r. jl
adjourned until Monday.
KENTUCKY MADMAN'S DEED.
Butchers His Family, Then Kills Himself.
A Trageay Almost Unprecedented
in the State.
LEXINGTON, Ky , Feb 13. â Tne
bloodiest domestic tragedy that ever took
place in this vicinity, or probably in the
whole of Kentucky, was enacted this
morninn in this city, when John Marrs in
a sudden fit of insanity butchered his
famiiy and then killed himself.
Marrs -was an eminently respectable
merchant in this city, a member of the
firm of Kauiman, Wilson & Co. His home
relations had been of the pleasantest pos
sible character, and there can be no doubt
that he was insane when he committed
his dreadful act. The fact that ho was
confined in an insane asylum ten years
ago lends confirmation 10 this theory. He
was about 40 years old.
Marrs evidently began his bloody work
us soon as he arose, as it was all over
about 8 o'clock this morning. When the
news of the tragedy spread and entrance
wu3 effected into the house a dreadful
scene was disclosed.
On a bed in one of t tie rooms lay the
body of his 4-year-old boy. He had been
shot in the forehead and nis throat had
been cut rum ear to ear. He had evi
dently been wbot as he' lay asleep in bed.
The bedclothes were saturated with blood
where the little body rested.
Marrs' 14-year-olu daughter Helen had
apparently witnessed toe killing of her
brother and had tried to e.^cape. She was
found lying in the hallway unconscious,
with a bullet wound in her head.
The third victim was Ida Marrs, the sis
ter of the murderer, whom he shot.
After this bloody work ha went to his
room, and, locking himself in, cut his
throat. Wben found his body presented
a horrible spectacle. A ghastly woun<)
across the throat nearly severed the head
from the body, and a great pool of blood
lay around the body on the floor. The
man's left hand stiil held a laree razor,
covered with blood, and near by lay a
large old-fashioned revolver with four
chambers empty.
When found Marrs and the boy were
both dead. Helen, the daughter, was still
alive, but whether she will recover is un
certain. The doctors, howevei, have hopes
for her. Ida Marrs' wounde are not dan
gerous. The shock to Mrs. Marrs was so
severe that it is feared she will die.

NEW YORK, N. V.. Feb. 13.â 0n the
assembling of the Lexow committee this
morning John F. Searles, secretary and
treasurer of the American Sugar-refining

explained that he had to leave town.
"Mr. Searles," he said, "will be present

NEW YORK, N\ V., Feb. 13.â The city
experienced tue third big snowstorm of
the winter Friday. Nearly eight inches of
snow had fallen at 6 o'clock thi3 evening.
Much of it came down in tbe form of sleet,
turning into snow of the consistency of
coarse salt as it struck the ground.
A high northeast wind, gradually in
creasing to a gate, prevailed. Snipping
was warned along the Atlantic coast to
stay safely in port. Travel was delayed
in ibis city and snowplows and uweepers
were kept busy clearing the lines of steam
aud surface railroads. The fact that it
was a public holiday operated to obviate
any serious disturbance of travel. The
storm began at 3 A. M., and the snow
siopued tailing at 6 p. M. The tempera
ture remained stationary at about 21
degrees.

NO CHANCE FOR
AN AGREEMENT
Ratification of the Arbitra
tion Treaty Impossible
This Session.
Senators Morgan, Mills, Danie:
and Cameron Stubbornly Re
fuse to Consider It
Now Baliev.d That Sherman Will
Cease to Press the Convention
far the Present
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. 13.â The
me ting of tiie Senate Committee on For
eign Relations tins morning made It ap
parent that no agreement could be reached
on tho general treaty of arbitration with
Great Britain that woirid bring the con
tending factions either in committee or in
the Senate together^ Wnile Sherman was
no', told so in exact words, the inference
to be drawn from what Morgan. Daniel
and Cameron said was that under no cir
cumstances could this treaty ba ratified at
the pre-ent session of the Senate. It is
believed tnat witn the executive session of
this afternoon Sherman will cease to press
the consideration of the conver tion and
permit other legislative business to have
the rieht of way.
After an hour and a half spent in dis
cussion, the committee this morning
framed an amendment along the lines in
dicated in the dispatches of the United
Associated Presses. It is based upon the
amendment of which Mor an gave notice,
and puts into language the interpretation
placed upon the convention by Turpie.
It provides that all subjects to be sub
mitted to arbitration under this general
treaty must bs submitted in the manner
and form prescribed for the submission
and ratification of the treaties originally.
This removes the obj ctions aimed at the
treaty by Morgan and others to the effect
that the submission of all subjects to arbi
tration under the treaty as now worded
wou;a be left entirely to the President. If
it is amended as suggested by the com
mittee's action of this morning only such
matters as .have been agreed to by the
full treaty-making power of the United
States, t-ie President and the Senate, act
ing jointly, can be submitted to arbitra
tion.
The power to negotiate and conclude
treaties in Great Britain is lodged in the
crown and is exercised by the Premier.
Ther* has been no suggestion that the
British treaty-making power has been
changed by the terms of this treaty, and
Turpie's contention was that in like man
ner the full treaty-making powur of the
United States was to sit in judgment
upon all subjects that were sought to be
taken before this higQ tribunal of arbitra
tion. â¢
The Senate did not agree with Turpiein
his interpretation, but found the easiest
way to a possible solution of the problem
confronting it in givinjt expression to the
interpretation in the text of the conven
tion. With such an amendment the treaty
is safeguarded absolutely, and the friends
of the instrument say there should not be
a dissenting vote in ratifying, for the rea
son that the question would then come
up before the existing Senate as an orig
inal proposition. The action of the com
mittee in adopting the amendment aid
not bring harmony. On the contrary, the
more the whole subject was discussed the
more evident it became that the differ
ences were irreconcilable.
Morgan, Daniel. Mills and Cameron re
fused to consider tbe treaty in a favorable
light, even after they had voted for the
amendment. They opposed the conven
tion on general grounds and said it was
impossible f r them to believe that the
country would be benefited br its ratifica
tion, at tbe present time at least. They
refused to listen to the pleading of Sher
man and bis associates and declined to
even admit that the amendment had ac
complished what had been sought.
The cotrmittee adj mrned with the
majority feeling anything but comfort
able over tbe outlook.
Early in the s-ession Senator Chandler
offered an amendment to tbe convention
in the shape of an additional article, which

WONDERFUL CORE FOR RHEUMATISM
Electro-Medical Treatment, the Great Rem-
edyâDiscovery That Has Baffled
Science for Centuries.
William Fitzgerald.
San Francisco is evidently designed to
become a penuine Mecca for rtieumatic-
lortured humanity, and the number of
people afflicted in that way is legion.
The news of the Electro-Medical Cure
for that dread disease, rheumatism, tbe
eminent discovery of the State Electro
Medical Institute, has proved welcome in-
telligence to thousands who are in tbe
grip of that excruciating ailment, and
t-very day witnesses ihe arrival in this
t'ity of patients from various points on the
coast.
It will soon be quite the thing for the
rheumatic-racked man of America to co&ne
<o the State Electro Medical Institute to
xpel his twinges, as it is for Continental
Europe to annually flock to Aix-les-Bains
in their desperate desire for relief.
That this electro-medical treatment is
â ' n Absolute Cure, permanent in its
ffcets. is now a recognized fact.
Evidence of tbe following character is
what has proven this treatment the great-
is, in fact, a declaration. It states that
both the contracting parties in making
this treaty do it for the pnrDose of enun
ciating belief in the principle of interna
tional arbitration, and to bring :tbout, if
po sible, tne po.icy of a general disarma
ment among the nations. It is further de
clared that each of ihe contacting parties
express their willingness nnd intention of
making similar treaties with other nations,
including not only those that are strong
and able to defend themselves, and who
have large military establishments, but
also with the smaller families of the na
tions with whom differences sim:iar to
those covered by t:<is treaty might arise.
YET THE RULER OF HAWAII.
Secretary Palmer Declares That Queen
Liliuokalam Never Legally Abdi
cated Her Throne.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. 13.â Julius
A. Palmer, the private secretary to Lih
uokalana, ex-Queen of the Hawaiian
I lands, in a semi-official utterance says
tbat the ex-Queen did not abdicate her
throne; that whatever she did was done
under duress, and that the name sierned
to the documents of abdication was not
her official signature.
In the circumstances Palmer asserts
tnat her action had no legal force what
ever, and could not be sustained in any
court of equity in Christendom, He con
tinues:
"I will be plainer if you wish. Do I
mean that the Queen of Hawaii has never
given a legal abdication; that she is still
the lawful ruler, even if she forbears to
enforce her legitimate rights? Ido mean
exactly that."
PALMER'S lIJLJS WORDS
LiUuokatani's Chamberlain Declared to
Re JUiitaken.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 13.â 0n the
reference to toe authorized statement
given out that ex-Queen Liliuokalani does
not consider her abdication as binding, a
prominent Hawaiian says:
"I venture to suggest that the Queen's
Chamberlain, Mr. Palmer, in his letter
puts a number of highly respectable gen
tlemen of Hawaii in a rather embarrassing
position. W. G. Irwiu is the leading
banker and large sugar planter, and Mr.
Irwin was one of the Queen's Cabinet, an
old resident, a man of wealth and stand
ing; Mr. Parker is also one of her ex-
Cabinet and one of the most prominent
leaders of the native Hawaiians, and the
other three who certify to her act of abdi
cation : are well-known citizens and her
active partisans. These gentlemen certify
that the act was considered carefully and
deliberately by Li iuokalani and that it
was her 'free act and deed.'
"Mr. Palmer is unfortunate in his cita
tion of the historian, Pro:essor Alexander,
for in the genealogical table ref- rred to in
his 'History of the Hawaiian People,' so
far from showing that Liliuokalani is de
scended from the 'ruling family in
Hawaii,' he makes it clear that the Queen
has not a drop of Kamehameha blood in
her veins. She derives all the claim she
has to the throne from a vote ot the Leg
islature and the liberal constitution ten
years ago (not a hundred years or so), and
in attempting to overthrow this same con
stitution she lost her crown." â¢

CARSON, Nit., Feb. 13.â Dan Stuart re
ceived a dispatch to-day from Al Smith,
â¢ the stakeholder, in New York, stating that
Smith|had received the final installment of
I'iUiimmons 1 money from Julian, and
now held the entire stakes. Stuart was all
smiles when he got the telegram, for it re
moved the last possible obstacle in the
way of the big right, and demonstrated to
the public that the principals meant busi
ness.
The whole world seems to want pictures
of Carson, and since it was known tnat the
right was to take place here the camera
men have been "rushed to death" with
work. The high rates charged by the pho
tographers, owing to the heavy demand,
caused the press correspondents to wire to
San Francisco for kodaks, andjnumbers of
amateur photographers are at work with
Instruments which range from the pocket
variety to the most expensive kinds. Dan
Istuart can not move about without
hearing the click, click of the pneumatic
shutters from all sides. Corbett's private
Secretary and "Billy" Woods, the pugilist,
are "shot" wherever they go, and
hundreds of views a day go out to familiar
ice the outside world with Carson street
scenes. No less than 100 amateur photog
raphers are charging about the county get
ting snapshots of everything and every
body, and the craze is spreading hourly.
. The question of feeding and housing the
restless multitudes is agitating the people
more than anything else, but the enter
prising citizens are determined that no
one shall be houseless ot hungry. Men
with an eye to business are already pro
curing cots and blankets from surround
ing towns and will be prepared to shelter
the visitors in barns, sheds, tents and all
aorta of temporary structures. An Indi
- ana firm has wired the reception commit
tee that it will be on hand ready to sup
ply cots and bedding for 10,000 people.
Several San Francisco firms are making
preparations to be on the ground to pro
vide the visitors with sleeping accommo
dations.
People who have followed these sort of
gatherings say that the mass of men who
Jove the sport don't care a rap where
they sleep if ibey have plenty to eat and
drink. The excitement of the big crowds
keeps them tip and they don't think of
sleep if they can see plenty of life, move
ment and hilarity.
Gambling is licensed in Nevada, and
tbere will be games enough in full blast
to accommodate men who like to buck
the tiger in other localities but cannot
without fear of police raids. There will
be no fear of a food famine. The finest
cattle in the world are now fat and sleek
on the big ranches of Carson Valley and
Truckee meadows, Mason Valley, all
within a day's drive 01 Carson, and it is
proposed to have hundreds of these
beeves barbecued for the benefit of the
visitors. They will be roasted in large
inclosures and the admittance will be 25
cents. This will enable the visitors to fall
on to the roast meat, eat all they can and
fall back to give others a chance. Five
thousand prime beef cattle can be sent
into Carson on short notice, and as many
tons of the choicest potatoes ever grown
in and about Dayton and Mason Valley â
the same sort of potatoes that took the
first premium at the three last World's
fairs â and there are three big flourmilis
and half a dozen creameries within a
radius of fifty miles that can furnish
bread and gilt-edged butter by the car
load. The people of Nevada are deter
mined not to let any one who comes to
this fight go away hungry.
Several thousand will come in palace
cars, remain in them ana carry their own
provisions. These people give the Carson-
Ites no concern. A canvass was made of
the city yesterday by the committee, and
they were very much encouraged. They
say they will have plenty of accommoda
tions, and arrangements are being made
for plenty of food.
Stuart received a telegram yesterday
from Al Smith in New York that all stake
money had been deposited with Smith,
the last installment of $5000 coming from
Julian on behalf of Fitzsimmons on the
same day. He will have $30,000 in bin
pockets to hand to the winner.
Stuart said to-day that he had leceived
letters from various architects in San
Francisco wishing to submit plans for the
pavilion, but he had made up his mind
that he could find architects in Nevada
who could do all the planning, and he
proposed to get everything in Nevada.
The people of this State had done the
right thing by him, and he proposed to
reciprocate by every means in his power.
He believed in home industry and was
going to proclaim it
To-night Stuart got a telegram from
Julian at Pueblo, Colo., asking if Fitzsim
raons could get quarters at Shaws Springs.
Stuart wired him back that Corbett was
already there. He did not want the two
men to train at the same resort or in the
same town fearing a fight might come off
before schedule time.
XETiO'B LITTLE BLVSf.
May Btmrt J.rgnl Complication* to Pre
vent the J ight.
RENO, Nsv.. Feb. 13.â From present in
dications Corbett will not give a boxing
exhibition in Reno Tuesday night without
trouble. The police officials have notified
the manager of the opera bouse here that
in accordance with the recently enacted
law, $1000 must be paid for a license before
the exhibition will be allowed. The attor
neys differ in opinion as to whether toe act
is intended to cover boxing exhibitions,
but at any rate the authorities will make
â¢ test case of the coming show.
Behind this apparently simple matter
which might be settled by Corbett's re
fusing to spar, there is a strong feeling
among the religious element that the big
fight shall not come off March 17. The
opponents to the fight say it could be
stopped very easily. They propose to
make a test case, in which the constitu
tionality of the recent act of the Legisla
ture will be questioned.
The lower courts will have to de
cide it, which they would do quickly, and
in all probability in favor of tbe leeality
of the act. That would be ju^t what the
religious people would want. They would
promptly rile their notice of appeal to the
Supreme Court, but would take ail the
time the law allowed them to actually file
the appeal.
The Supreme Court ?1 course would noi
be sodigmtied as to ha;,. en a decision, and
so it might be 1898 or thereabouts when
Corbett and Fitzsimmons get together in
tbe ring.

Jtfo Longer Any Doubt About Hit Want
ing to fight.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 13.â AH
doubts as to Fitzsimmons' desire to evade
putting up the rest of his side bet were
dispelled to-night when Al Smith, the
official stakeholder for the big fight, re
ceived the following telegram, dated
Pueblo, Colo. :
Yon will receive the balance of our money,
$5000, on Monday through the First National
Bank, New York. You will tben have $7500
of our money in your hands, which covers the
$5000 side bet and $.2500 Fitzsimmons ap
pearance money, as agreed upon by Fit'.sim
mons and Corbett. Kindly send me receipt
certifying the above to Carson City, care
Stuart. Maktin Julian.
This telegram sets aside the rumors
which have been floating about during the
last couple of days to the effect that Fitz
simmons and Julian would try to get out
of putting up their portion of the side bet
Tltese rumors arose over the fact that
Fitzsimmons left town without first hav
ing posted the money.

ing, Queen's pawns opening, French de

The numbers of the mo7es are as fol

The following summary of the play will
be of interest: Pillsbury had a better game
and oueht to have beaten Blackburn.
When Blackburn accepted the draw offered
by Pillsbury he cabled: "I was lucky to
escape with a draw. Kind regards to my
American friends."
Lacock made an error in the opening
and fell an easy prey to Showalter's supe
rior tactics.
Atkins proved too good for Burille. The
latter lost two pawns in the middle of the
game, and he had no chance afterward.
Ihe games betffnen .Mills and Hymes
and Hodges and Bellingnam were splen
didly and evenly contested throughout,
both games endme in draws.
The veteran Deimar altogether out
played his adversary Blake, and he won
by brilliant play.
Helms made an error in the opening
against Jackson, which circumstance en
abled the latter to win.
Cole showed a marked superiority in
end game play, and after a long and pro
tracted struggle had to resign.
McCutcheon also committed himself in
the opening, and Jacobs experienced few
difficulties in registering a win for his side.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 14,Â» 1897.
TO BUTTLE WITH
GOVERNOR BUDD
Legislators Introduce New
Bills for a Printing
Appropriation.
If These Cannot Become Law
Then the Oifice Will Be
Closed Down,
And the Republican Statesmen Wil:
Introduce Economy That Will
B: Widespread.
EACRA.MENTO, Cal., Feb. 13.â The
Governor's message, boiled down, is to
the effect that it costs a very large sum
annually to print the reports of about
sixty departments of State and the State
series of textbooks, and that the printing
done for the executive and for the com
missioners appointed by him has increased
the cost over that of several years ago be
fore those commissions were born. It is
also not disputed that the State Printer
must print and bind everything that is
sent to his office by a State official, and
that the expense does not lie on his shoul
der-, but on the shoulders of the State
officials and commissions.
It is also conceded that $75,000 is need d
to carry on the State Printing Office to
July 1; that appropriations as large for
the same period of time have been made
to Democratic State Printers when the
number of commissions, bureaus, etc., was
only one-third of what it is now. In the
face of this state of facts the Republican
legislators say that the Governor's veto is
indefensible.
The sincerity of the Governor's motives
is questioned. When be and the commit
tee appointed to visit various State in
stitutions were at Coronado the Governor
in the presence of Assemblyman Arnerich
of Santa Clara, Price of Sonoma, and
others spoke bitterly of the State Printer
and of the appropriation desired by his
office. His manner and his language con
vince i the legislators who heard him that
he would veto the appropriation and that
he was prejudiced against the State
Printer.
As an instance of tbe Governor's insin
cerity when he speaks of his desire to pre
vent waste and extravagance Republicans
are citing tbe case of John A. Wyiiie, the
Governor's colored messenger. Wyllie
draws from the State a salary of $100 per
month as messenger and $30 per month
additional as porter for tbe Bureau of
Highways. It is thought by many people,
who make no pretense of being reformers,
that $130 per month is rather extravagant
wages for a man to run errands for the
Governor and to sweep out 'one room
which constitutes the office of the .bureau
of Highways.
When all the facts were taken into con
sideration tbe Republican caucus decided
that no compromise short of the right
was possible, and it took the only course
that was left to it in honor. Then when
tbe State Printer cut down his force by
discharging twenty-four men and four
women, all of whom bad been appointed
at the request of Democrats, the gentle
men of that persuasion began to perceive
that they had waded in beyond their
depth.
Hence the frantic but unsuccessful effort
of Sbanahan to introduce two bills to-day,
one for an appropriation of $40,000 and the
other for an appropriation of $35,000 lor
the printing office â repentance, as it were,
on the installment plan. The Republi
cans decided that if the Governor wanted
to back out in two motions the credit for
the appropriations should be placed with
them, and Dibble accordingly introduced
two similar bills, which will be considered
next Tuesday.
The tempest in the State Printing Office
has developed an important factor in the
matter, and that is the unpopularity in
side and outside of the office of Book
keeper Hadley. Employes of the print
ing office who are brought into close rela
tions with him do not like him for his
brusque manners and what the}' allege to
be his domineering way. It is believed
that Governor Bn Id does not like him
eiti.er, and that if be bad the appoint
ment of 1000 colored messenger-uortera at
$130 per month he would not appoint
Hadley, for it is known that several per
sons who were given positions in the
printing office at the solicitation of the
Governor disliked tbe bookkeeper both
before and after th*y were discharged,
and mention his name with words that
burn.
Chairman Mellck of the Committee on
Retrenchment wai told a day or two ago
that if Johnston would discharge Had lev
tne Governor would be mollilied, but the
persons who told him this did not say
that they were authorized by the Gov
esnor to do so.
So it would seem that there are other
things besides patriotism, economy and
an unselfish desire to do right that lie at
the root of political action, even on the
highest peak? of the mountains. Mean
while preparations are being made for
next Tuesday's battle. Trenches for the
dead and rifle pits for the sharpshooters
are being dug. The heavy artillery it
being hurried to the front. If the
Governor still continues obdurate and
insists upon blocking the wneels of legis
lation, which the closing down of the
State Printing Office would bring about,
Republican legislators intend to give an
object lesson in economy by lopping off
a large number of the bureaus and com
missions, the cosy berths which are filled
by the Governor's appointees and by
scaling down salaries in a way that will
delight evary lover of economy.

Withington's motion to reconsider Sen

adopted and the bill passed. Adjourned.
In the Assembly this morning Speaker
Coombs receded from yesterday's ruling
on the printing bill and said the vote on
the Governor's veto could not be reconsid

Bills were introduced by Dibble to meet
the requirements of the State Printer â
one for $40,000 to cover expenses to the
end of the present session of the Legisla
ture, another for $36,000 for the remainder
of the fiscal year. The bills were made a
special order for nex r Tuesday.
Sbanahan introduced a similar bill as>
propriatlng $40,000, but it was rejected as
being a duplicate of Dibble's bill.
Caminetti introduced a resolution in
structing the State Printer to report to the
House the names of the persons said to
nave been discharged yesterday, all of
whom, it is claimed, are Democrats. The
resolution was referred to the Committee

JVKISIH AUK HEARTt.
Important BiatterÃ lie fore the Joint
Judiciary Committee.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 13.â When
the joint session of the Senate and
Assembly Judiciary Committees was
called to order this afternoon, there were
present in the interest of proposed
Supreme Court legislation: Chief Justice
W. H. Beatty, ex-Chief Justice Niles
Searls, ex-Justices Van R. Paterson and
Charles N. Fox, Judge Robert Y. Hayne,
president of the Bar Association, Dr. E. R.
Taylor, ex-president of the Bar Asso
ciation, and John T. Wright, the organizer
of the Bar Association.
Two measures in the shape of constitu
tional amendments have been introduced,
providing for appellate courts to relieve
the Supreme Court. One of these is
fa'bered by the Bar Association and pro
vides for three district appellate courts.
Tbe other is the idea of Judge Van R.
Paterson and looks to the establishment
of but one such tribunal. In all, there are
about eight measures on the regulation of
the Supreme Court business.
In view of the difference of opinion be
tween the jurists present, Judge Hayne
suggested that the consideration of the
whole subject be postponed until a con
ference of the parties in interest could be
held and tbe situation shorn of its con
flicting features.
Judge Paterson rose to speak in behalf
of the Supreme Court Commission, and to
ask for it; continuance, and was agree
ably surprised when informed that the
bill on this subject had already passed
both houses and was now in the hands of
the Governor.
It was aeciaed to postpone the hearing
until next Saturday at 2 p. m.
The judicial visitors then agreed to hold
an executive meeting on Monday at 10
A. m. at the rooms of the Supreme Court in
San Francisco for the purpose of prepar
ing measure? that will harmonize their
opinions and thus simplify matters for the
Legislature. These are to be sent here by
Thursday morning, so as to be printed
and in shape for the committees' consid
eration at tbe appointed time.

A Statement From the Controller JTÂ«-
plaining the Matter fully.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 13.âCon
troller Colgan has addressed the following
letter to Assemblyman Soward, chairman
of the Committee on Mines:
Replying to your Inquiry of the 6th inst.
relative to the appropriation of $250,000 made
by the act of the Legislature approved March
24, 1893, for the impounding of mining debris :
No part of this appropriation has been
drawn from the State treasury, and the entire
amount remains therein, unexpended.
The act above cited provides for the ap
pointment of a Debris Commissioner for a
period of four years only, and makes no provi
sion for the appointment of a successor. It
would therefore appear that the intent of the
Legislature was to create the office for the
period of four years, at the end of which time
the office would cease to exist.
There appears to be no limitation at to the
life of the appropriation. The only condi
tions surrounding It arc that no warrant
against H may be drawn or paid until the
T'nited States Government shall have appro
priated an equal amount for a like purpose,
and that the money is to be paid only upon
orders drawn by the Controller upon the writ
ten request ol the Debris Commissioner, and
only lor payment ol not more than one-half of
the cost of construction of works for restrain
ing and Impounding mining debris.
It follows, therefore, that unless the law Is
amended, or the ottice of Debris Commis
sioner is continued in existence, the appro*
priation could not be used, as no legal de
mand could be made upon the Controller.

the convention and banquet of the Ohio
Republican League Clubs at Evansville
last night, stopped in Canton, on his way
East, to see Major McKiniey. Senator
Thurston was apparently pleased with tbe
disposition toward harmony which he
found among tbe Ohio Republicans. He
left for the East this afternoon.
A party of 100 enthusiastic Cleveland
Republicans stopped for an hour in Can
ton on their homeward journey from the
Zanesville banquet, and called on Major
McKinley. They marched through the
streets behind a vigorous band.
Professor William Harper and W. P.
Wilson of the Philadelphia Commercial
Museum called on the President-elect to
invitu him to be present at the meeting of
tbat institution next June. He said if
they would call his attention to the event
about twenty days before its occurrence,
he would try to arrange to be present.
Booker Washington, president of the
Normal and Industrial College at Tusko
gee, Alabama, wno is said to be the fore
most colored orator in the country, called
to pay his respects to Major McKinley to
day. Unlike many colored men who have
been here, Mr. Washington is not a poli
tician and does not want an office. He
was also one of the speakers at tbe Zanes
ville banquet last evening.
Major McKinley does not expect to be
in Canton tbe first half of next week. He
has one or two business matters that he
has to attend to, and if he does not take
tbe time at once there will be no other
opportunity before he goea to Washing
ton. Visitors who come to Canton before
Thursday next expecting to see the Presi
dent-elect will probably be disappointed,
for arrangements for his departure are
well under way.
BAXQUETM* BY BACKERS.
Zyman J- Gage the Quest of Manor at
a Chicago Club Brent.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 13.â Lyman J.
Gasre, who is to be President McKinley's
Secretary of the Treasury, was the euest
of honor at a banquet given at the Au
ditorium Hotel to-night by his fellow*
members of tne Bankers' Club.
Two hundred citizens, prominent in the
commercial, financial and professional
life of Chicago, filled the small banquet
ball, and joined in the farewell tribute of
regard and God-speed. The presi
dent of the club, Jonn J. Mitchell,
head of the Illinois Trust and Savings
Bank, said the President-elect had made
no mistake in disregarding the desires of
politicians by appointing Mr. Gage to the
treasury. It was the best appointment
since Alexander Hamilton was given
charge of the country's financial policy.
F. D. Lacey, congratulated Mr. Gage,
this city and the country because Mr.
Gage cad been appointed without solicita
tion, because be was a consistent advo
cate of civil service reform and his ap
pointment was a victory for that reform.
An outburst of applause greeted Mr.
Gape when he rose to reply. He said he
had read so rfluch in the last fortnight in
praise of himself and about himself that
he had doubted if he was himself at all.
The illusion was helped out by cartoons
tie had seen of a young man with a mus
tache and goatee a la Napoleon and
under it his name, lie fully realized his
individual responsibility in the larger
National sphere into which he had been
called, and hoped bis Chicago friends
would not regret the confidence they had
reposed in him.
CHAUXCKI DEVEW EXPLAINS.
Say He Cannot Accept a 3/ is ion That
1* Hot Yet Offered..
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 13.â "The
man wno would say whether he would
accept an office like that of Embassador
to the Court of St. James before it is
offered to him is not fit to fill that or any
other office," said Dr. C. M. Depew to a
reporter this morning.
"it is not true," he continued, "that I
have been offered the post, and I may
add that I have not received one word on
the subject from Canton. All that 1 know
is that Governor Morton has written a
letter to President-elect McKinley pro
posing my name and suggesting that my
selection would be agreeable to the Re
publicans of New YorK State. Of course
having received no intimation from Major
McKinley I can say nothing further.
"As to my resigning the presidency of
the New York Central, all I have to say is
that up to the present time such an idea
has not entered my head." Mr. Depew
has not yet fully recovered from the cold
he recently contracted and is still con
fined to the house.
SARD BLOW AT BUSHNJSLL.
Hi* Favoriti Defeated for a County Com
mittee Chairmanship.
COLUMBUS, Ohio. Feb. 13.â Governor
Busbnell's Senatorial arbirations received
a hard blow in his own county to-day in
the organization of the County Commit
tee when George Beard, a McKinley man,
defeated Samuel Wilkinson for chairman,
Wilkinson being Governor Bushnell's fa
vorite. The defeat of the Governor in his
own county was very quietly worked and
bis friends did not know until the vote
was taken that Wilkinson would have op
position. It apparently means the defeat
of McGraw, the Governor's son-in-law, for
the nomination for State Senator for
which he was announced.

Acquitted of the Murder of Colliandet
at Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 13.â The sensa
tional trial of Alderman Thomas J.
O'Mulley and John Santry on the charge
of being members of the gang which
raided the Oak-street polling-place in
November, 1894, to steal the ballots and
killed Gustav Colliander while in the act,
ended to-night in the acquittal of both
defendants of the murder accusation.
There was a demonstration of approval
in Judge Tu! ley's court when the verdict
was announced, after several hours' delib
eration by the jury, and the exonerated
Alderman was tendered an enthusiastic
reception by his fellow-citizens of the
ward which he represents in the Council.
The trial created an intensely bitter
feeling, the German and Irish races and
Protestant and Roman religions being
brought into antagonistic relation. Many
men have been charged with the Coliian
der murder and numerous arrests have
been made in various parts of the coun
try, but the oroof of complicity in the
murderous raid has never been fastened
on any one.
T c announcement of the acquittal of
Alderman O'Malley was a severe blow to
Inspector of Police Michael Schack, who
had brought out the evidence on which
the indictments were returned. Ever
9ince the Colliander murder Inspector
Schack has worked vigorously on the case
and after the indictment of O'Malley it
bas been generally asserted 'that unless a
conviction was secured the inspectors po
lice record was ended. After hearing tne
verdict to-night the inspector went home,
where a little later be was seized with
what is believed to be a stroke of paraly
sis and his physician says his condition is
serious. His wife was* also taken ill to*
night.

CRISIS IMMINENT
Educational Bill Dissen
sions Embarrass . the
Government.
Cecil Rhodes Has a Trump Card
to Play at the Transvaal
Investigation.
Novel Breach of Promise CaseâActiv
ity in College Sportsâ Amateurism
and Professionalism.
LONDON, Esq., Feb. 12.â Simple as
the educational bill seems, as compared
with the bill of last year, it has already
imperiled the reputation of Mr. Balfour,
and is proving a sure embarrassment to
the Government. If the present bill sinks
under the discord among the Unionists
and the tactios of the Liberal opposition,
Mr. Balfour's days as leader of the House
are numbered. Numerous communica
tions have since reached the Government
whips that the measure must be altered
when its details come to be discussed. If
these demands irom within their own
party are assented to and the bill en
larged, the principle of primal educational
reform, upon which Mr. Balfour proceeds,
must be given up. Mr. Balfour then prob
ably will resign, and with him those of
his colleagues in the Cabinet who have
identified themselves with this policy.
The conservative whips advise Mr. Bal
lour to call upen his present majority and
force the bill through so as to get the
grant to voluntary schools made available
for the current fiscal year. Otherwise
they predict the resignation of the Minis
try, with an early dissolution of .Parlia
ment.
Meetings of the leaders of the opposi
tion, at which Lord Kimberley and other
peers were present, have been held at Sir
William Harcourt's residence. Sir Wil
liam Harcourt's leadership of the party is
now an acknowledged fact.
The withdrawal from political life of
Bir George Otto Trevelyan is regretted on
all sides. His conservative opponents
have copiously abused him for "ratting"
unionism, but outside of politics he has
the good will of all men. He retires now
to his home in Northumberland and will
devote what strength he has to literature.
An application from the Chinese Gov
ernment to the Admiralty to commend a
British naval adviser has resulted in the
appointment of Captain Gundes, head
of tne marine service on the Niger coast.
He leaves England at the end of February
to take up the position of chiel of the
Tiensin Naval Acauemy and ad vis r to the
Chinese Government.
Justice Collins, the fellow arbitrator
with Lord Herschel on behalf of Great
Britan on the Venezuelan boundary tri
bunal, has decided not to return to the
law courts after the Easter recess until
tne work of the arbitration tribunal is
ended. He will be marked out for pro
motion afterward.
A very remarkable case that may soon
come before the Jaw courts is interesting a
certain section of London Bociety. It is
an action for breach of promise and per
sonal injuries brought by a gentleman
against a lad}-. The plaintiff, though of
very moderate means, is connected with
some of the very best families of old stand
ing and the defendant is a lady belonging
to the wealthy Jewish community. Toe
circumstances of the case are unique. Ac
cording to the plaintiff's claim he was ac
cepted by the defendant as her intended
husband, but it was insisted upon by her
family that he should adopt the Jewish
faith. He even underwent the physical
operation necessary to conversion. After
ward it would seem that the engagement
was broken off, not, according tv his state
ment, through any fault of his. An ac
tion 18 Deing started for this alleged breach
of promise of marriage and for damages
for the personal injuries he underwent in
submitting to the operation referred to.
Sir Edmund Munson, the new British
Embassador to Paris, will shortly be made
a peer. Several important vacancies are
pending in the Colonial Office. Gout has
Bupervened in Sir Robert Mead's frac
tured legs and he will shortly retire from
the permanent Under Secretaryship. Mr.
Fairfield, the head of the important South
African Department, has long been absent
in ill-health in the south of France, and
his post will have to be filled up.
The Prince of Wales, who, as Duke of
Cornwall, is grand landlord of Kensington
Oval, the great South London cricket
ground, has inserted a singular proposi
tion in renewing the lease. He stipulates
that soldiers, sailors, policemen and post
men in uniform are at all times to be ad
mitted to the grounds free.

Mr. Rhodes is credited with having a
trump card in the game of disclosures
before the select committee on the Trans
vaal raid. He is said to be in possession
of letters that passed long prior to the
Jameson expedition between President
Kruger and Emperor William, and be
tween Dr. Leyds and the German Foreign
Minister.
These documents were abstracted from
Dr. Leyds while at Pretoria, before his
visit to Berlin, and were got hold of by
Mr. Rhodes and are to be produced as
justification of the raid, which was meaDt
to counteract, successful or unsuccessful,
ns an armed operation, the German plots.
Mr. Rhodes desires that his examina
tion shall be concluded as speedily as pos
sible, as he thinks his early return to
South Africa is necessitated by the posi
tion of affairs there. The Boer faction,
led by Dr. Leyds, is becoming strong
enougn to menace the more moderate
Kruger party. If Dr. Leyds gets the upper
hand the abrogation of the London con
vention and the entire independence of
the republic would be declared at once.
The Anglophobist Boers would warmly
welcome a war with England.
Lord Kosraead (late Sir Hercules Rob
inson), Governor of Cape Colony, and
Sir Graham Bower, Imperial Secretary at
the Cape, will arrive in London toward
the end of April to give evidence before
the raid committee. Lord Rosmead will
not return to the Cape, his resignation,
which has been in the hands of Mr. Cham
berlain for three months, haying been ac
cepted. His successor will not be ap
pointed until after ins arrival here.
The attention of the footbail world is
still absorbed in the quarrel between the
International Rugby Board and Wales.
Even after the patching up tnat bas been
attempted everybody admits that the in
ternational board (mostly English Rugby
Union officials) has been very silly. It is
tiie old trouble of distinguishing between
amateurism and profe-sionalism. Wales
has a veteran halfback, A. J. Gould, who
is admitted by most competent judges to
be the finest exponent of the game that
has ever been seen. He is a veteran, and
will probably retire in a few years.
Welsh followers of footbail, having in
mind the lone-boomed subscription testi
monial to Dr. Grace, the cricketer, thought
they woulu lice to honor their own cham
pion. They raised Â£700, with which it
was intended to buy for Gould the free
hold of the small country house in which
he lives.
Hereupon the international board
stepped in and declared that Gould, if he
accepted the testimonial, would become a
professional. Wales', of course, resented
the interference, and hence a deadlock
which has delayed the international
matches. Wales has already won the hrst
of these with England. The great body
of amateur players has no sympathy with
this policy, and the ultimate result seems
likely to be a complete obliteration by
public opinion of ail distinction between
the amateur and professional classes.
Cambridge University is this year mak
ing tremendous efforts to w.n the boat
race. Extraordinary care has been taken
in the selection of me crew. Councils of
war are held daily by the best coachers of
former years after the crew's practice and
changes are lrequent. Cambridge's crew
is about ten pounds lighter than Oxford's
men, although this difference in weight
may make no difference. Dudley Ward,
one of the new oars in the Cam bridge boat,
was the best of last year's Eton crew,
wilier rowed so well at Henley. It has
been a great disappointment that the two
brothers, Rupert and Ernest Guinness, sons \
of Lora Iveach, are not available for tarn- '
bridge. Both crews have last year's I
strokes, Oxford keeping Gould, an old Eton
boy and stroke of the brilliant New Col- i
lege crew at Henley last yoar, and Cam
bridge has Ferme, a very powerful oar.
"TREASON, TREASON!" HE CRIED.
An Insane Student Created a Dramatic
Scene in (he French Chamber
of Deputies.
PARIS, Franck, Feb. 13.â A dramatic
scene occurred in the Chamber of Depu
ties this evening which for a time caused
much excitement in that body. The pro
ceedings of the chamber were going along
in routine fashion when suddenly a young
man in the gallery, who had been watch
ing the deputies, sprang to his feet and
leaning forward shouted in a loud voice,
"Treason, treason; in 1900 Paris will be a
cemetery."
The members of the chamber present
were greatly surprised and demands were
made for the arrest of the man. When,
however, an attempt was made to take
him into custody he made a desperate re
sistance and it was only with the greatest
difficulty that he was arrested. It was
then learned that he was Pierre Tramoni,
president of the Students' Association of
Aix, and that he had suddenly gone in
sane. Ha was removed to the hospital,
where it is hoped that under proper treat
ment he will recover.
SLAVERY IN NICARAGUA.
Terrible State of the Labor Marketâ Men
and Women Subjected to a s>s
tem of Bondage.
PANAMA, Colombia., Feb. 13.â The
Panama Star and Herald says: Nlcara
guan advices are to the effect that a terri
ble state of affairs prevails there in the
labor market, and the system of selling
labor has resulted in reducing very large
numbers of men, women and children to
a state of slavery.
Men and women are endeavoring by
every possible way except an armed revo
lution to escape from the sale of their
labor, authorized by the constitution of
Nicaragua and enforced as vigorously as
possible by military power, until the
money for poods advanced to them there
on and heavy fines for delinquenoy have
been paid in full by labor at low rates.
Owners of coffee estates recently held
a meeting with the object cf influencing
the Government of Nicaragua to establish
In Cuba a labor establishment to induce
Cuban laborers to migrate to Nicaragua.

Xo Proof That Mr*. Dfmond Tried to

HONOLULU. Hawaii, Feb. 7.â General
A. S. Hartwell proceeds to Washington
this morning per Doric. He is the agent
of the Pacific Cable or Bcrymser Company
in dealing with the Hawaiian Government.
He denied that his present errand is con
nected with cable matters, which he
believes will have been finally dealt with
before he will arrive. He will work for an
nexation as opportunity may arise.
The Hawaaiian Government is on the
alert for any action necessary to secure an
nexation. Officials are prepared promptly
to send forward to Washington a suitable
commission, whenever advised by Minister
Hatch of any such need. It is thought
probable, however, that Mr. Hatch will be
able to avail himself of sufficient help
from L. A. Thurston, and perhaps also
General Haitwell.
The charge of contempt brought against
Mrs. Carrie E. Dimond was to-day dis
missed by the court on the ground of insuf
ficient evidence to prove an attempt to
bribe witnesses to testify against her
husband.

HAVANA, Cuba., Feb. 13.â Jose Varela
Zeguira, a prominent physician, has been
arrested here on the charge of conspiracy
against the Government. Dr. Zeguira's
brother Eduardo was transported to the
i Chaffarine Islands some time ago.
Eight native Philippine officers have
been transferred from the army there for
, service in Cuba.
About 300 families have arrived in the
city of Santa Clara from the country.
Their homes have been completely de
stroyed by the Spanish troops, who are
burning or otherwise destroying every
thing of value in the province outside the
cities and towns. The condition of the
refugees is pitiable. Many of them were
not able to obtain lodgings in the city,
having no money to pay therefor, and
! they have been compelled to camp in the
I outskirts, where they have little or no
protection from the elements.
The rebels have apparently disappeared
from the province of Santa Clara, but it is
known that they are sheltered in the hills
) where the Spanish troops cannot reach
them. All the columns accompanying
General Weyler are said to be seeking for
them, but can find no trail. As the troops
have maae no attempt to enter the hills
it is quite certain they will discover no in
surgents so long as the latter remain en
j sconced in their hiding-places.
General Weyler to-day continued his
march through the province. His forces
are divided into three columns, he him
self commanding the center one.
Captain Ochoa reports from Cienfnegos
that he has repulsed in that district an
attack made by about 200 rebels. He said,
it is reported, that the rebels were led by
various chiefs and that they were escort
ing the members of the rebel government.
This iB not believed in Havana, as it is
not thought probable that such a small
number of Insurgents would be entrusted
with the duty of escorting their govern
ment.

friends he has accepted his sentence and
will eerve it. As the seven months which

FIGHTING FOR MARIN LAND.
Forty Acres of Valuable Property Which
Has Been in Litigation for Sev
enteen Years.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Feb. 13.â The cele
brated land case of Wormuth versa 3 Gard
ner, involving the title to forty odd acres
of valuaDle land in Mill Valley, was taken
up yesterday in the Superior Court oi
MarinCounty before JudgeF.M.Angellotti.
The litigation over the property is part of
the history of the county and extends over
a period of seventeen years. Both the
plaintiff and defendant are men of promi
nence and considerable means and have
lived in the county sine- the years wtien
railroads had not yet oeen built in Marin.
The property is situated on the county
road which runs into Mill Valley and
Blitnedale and adjoins the vast estate of
the Boyles and Lytords.
In 1880 Jacob Gardner claimed the prop
erty, which he asaerted He had purchased
from the Throckmorton estate, which
consisted of all the property from Sausa
mo to Bolinas, including Mill Valley.
Wormuth, on the other hand, produced
a United States patent entitling him to
tne full control of the land. Then the
matter went through the United States
Land Office and finally reached tne In
terior Department, the decision being in
favor of Wormuth.
The dispute was then taken into the Su
perior Court and was twice given a hear
ing. Yesterday it came up for the third
time in the Superior Court.
The disputed property in Mill Valley
has greatly increased in value and now
commands about $500 per acre.

Ltdgn Discovered by Prospector* From
Santa Barbara.
BANTA BARBARA, Cal., Feb. 13.â
Undertaker Emigh of this city has found
a gold mine in Smiths Canyon. For sev
eral months past two experienced miners
have been prospecting in that neighbor
hood and supposed six weeks ago that
they had struck the main lode. After
their report went out Mr. Emigh and
some friends began prospecting in the
canyon. Lately he sent specimens, the
results of their search, to Los Angeles to
be assayed. Yesterday he got the assay
er's certificate, announcing the quartz to
be worth $22 a ton. Since then a canvas
city has arisen in the canyon that bids
fair to outrival Randsburg.
Smitns Canyon is eleven miles from
Santa Barbara, two miles from La Patera
station, on the Southern Pacific Railroad,
and adjoins the ranch of Herman P.
Stowe.
self; you will find that is also true. Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla is laxative. You
know this after the second day.
Then the three eood reasons for you to
take the native remedy are that it ia vege-
table, laxative and brings out no pimples.
These things being true, when you ask
for Joy's see that you get Joy's; don't
allow any one to persuade you to take other
than the native remedy. There are siill
a few druggists who try to substitute be-
cause they don't want the native remedy to
succeed. Whatever is native is sure to be

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 13.â With
clashing cymbals and the blare of trum
pets, eac.j man bearing a curved scime
tar and adorned with the gorgeous red
fez, a caravan of 200 Nobles of the Mystic
Snrine, Islam Temple, arrived at the oasis
of Sacramento this evening from the far
away desert of San Francisco. They were
met on their entrance by the brethren of
the local tribe, who escorted them to the
cool shades 01 the Golden Eagle hostelry,
where a bounteous feast ot camel's flesh,
jo ai's milk and dates awaited the weary
toilers over the desert sands.
Nor were these the only tribesmen who
had hurried to this oasis for the so'e pur
pose of escorting the neophytes on their
pilgrimage lo MÂ« cca. Car-on, Reno,
Truckee and numerous other localities
contributed their quota, until the streets
were lined with ihe wearers of the fez, and
the cry of the tribes could be heard on
every hand.
Laer in the evening the brethren gath
ered at the Temple and lent a helping
hand to thirtr-six longing and thirsting
pilgrims, who â earnest seekers alter the
true liirh; â were ready and willing to ex
piate the r s'.ns by treading with bare feet
the blazinu sands and climbing on bend
ing knee- t c lefty pyramMs; while in
the far distance the siitnl Sphinx smiled
at their agony and fear.
Nor were the neophytes made to suffer
for their s;:;< i ceo ding to ancient usage-?;
for it was promised that modern electric
appliances, threshing machines, instru
ments of torture, bucking camels, fa'gin
ing elephants and other bric-a-brac were
on hand with which to administer to
their desires; and the pass- word was
"Gawmoo'l-queeyamah," which being in

At the end of tbe journey, the weary

assert that they are both under age.
When interviewed late this afternoon,
Mrs. T. D. Mott, the mother of the yountr
man. stated she had nothing to say in re
gard to her son's marnaee. She had ob
tained her first information in regard to
the ceremony from the newspaper re

FRESNO, Cal.. Feb. 13.â J. M. Cory,
Alex Gordon and A. E. Smith, tbe arbi
tration board selected to settle the
difference between the Valley lioad Com
pany and Frank H. Bal. over the right of
way through the latter's vineyard south
of town, met to-day, and after several
hours of deliberation awarded Mr. Ball
$4000 for the land to be taken by the rail
road, including damages for tbe passing
of the road in front of his residence. Ac
cording to tbe articles of arbitration there
is no appeal from this decision. The set
tlement of the difficulty witn Mr. Ball
leaves ihe right of way between Fresno
and Hanford clear, and tbe company can
now proceed with track-building without
any outside hindrance. The grading will
begin on Monday.
The sum allowed Mr. Ball is a good,
round one for the small piece of land he
will part with, bnt the damaees that he
will sustain amount to considerable. The
railroad will pass along the end of his
vineyard facing the avenue and immedi
ately in front of his residence. During
his residence there Mr. Ball has made
some fine improvements in the way of
planting trees and shrubbery, and these
will be ruined.
The officials of the Valley road â Robert
Watt, the vice-president; Captain A. H.
Payson, the director, and Chief Engineer
W. B. Story Jr. â who came down from
San Francisco on Friday evening, re
mained here all day and will return home
on the Southern Pacific to-raorrow morn
ing. They spent the day in lookine over
a few important engineering difficulties
south of the city and in conferring with
property-owners along the Reedley route.
Ou this line settlements for rights of
way have practically been effected with
all but three property-owners, and these
are considered bo unreasonable that con
demnation suits will have to be brought
ugainst them â a policy which tbe railroad
company has now instituted as a last re
s >urce. Tbe papers for the suits are be
niK prepared by the attorneys and will be
Hied in ;i few days. The three persons
wno are i.u'ding out for prices consid
ered unreasonable by the company are:
W. 8. Kendell of Sacramento, I. J. Tru
man ot San Francisco and the Smilie
Bros. (Robert and A, J.) of Oakland.
Their lands are situated near together,
about eighteen miles southeast of this
city at.d about four miles south of Sanger.
The railway company desires a strip
about a third of a mile in length through
Mr. Kendell'a place, embracing about four
acres. For this the owner demands $2000,
or $500 an acre. It is assessed at $27 50 an
acre. The company considers $250 a goo i
valuation and is willing to pay this. Mr.
Kendell wants $1750 more, however, and
clothing world that has taken place for
some time oast is the consolidation of the
business interests of H. Bummerneld and
J. H. Roman under the firm name of
Summernei'3 Â«fe Roman at the corner of
Fifth and Market streets. This move
means the inauguration of a monstrous
sale of the stock of two tremendous stores
under the roof of one establishment,
which commences to-morrow.
Mr. Sunimerfield, who for the past de
the Valley road people have retused to en
tertain his proposition. They have no
other course to pursue but appeal to the
courts.
Mr. Ken. I ell was formerly a bunker in
Sacramento, and is quite wealthy. His
attempt at what is considered a '"hold-U""
of the railroad is not viewed favorably by
the people along the line who could" not
so well afford to be liberal toward the
competing road.
The Smihe Brothers appear stil! more
unreasonab c. They were the contractors
for the additions to Fresno County's
Courthouse, and the Fresnoites feel tbÃt
theycouid well afford to encourage the
railroad, which means so much to them
and to tbe people of the county, from
whom they secured no small amount of
money. The contracting firm owns a
larj:e tract of land and the survey of the
Valley road eoes throueh it for the dis
tance of about a mile. Ths area of land
the strip embraces is in the neighborhood
of thirteen acres. For this $5000 in cash,
improvements along the right of way,
which will coit aDout $7000, and a haif
interast in a townsite in the vicinity are
a^ked.
It nppears that Robert Srailie has acted
somewhat strangely in tbe matter. Wh- n
tbe procunne of nÂ«bt of way between
tbis city and Reedley was first taken up,
be said that he and bis brother would do
nate the strip of land to the new road.
He even went so far as to uree other
property-owners aloni* the line to do the
same, and took particular occasion to an
nounce his own liberality. But when the
lime came for making the deed, and after
the company had secured deeds for nearly
all of tbe right of way, Mr. Smilie changed
bis mind and wanted excellent pay for
nis land.
I. J. Truman wants $500 for about four
acres of land, which his tenant and agent
say is not worth more thau $200. Th* land
is assessed at $25 an acre. The railroad
company believes that tbe three acres are
not worth more than a third of what is
asked for them.

SEATTLE, Wash., Feb. 13.â Four thou
sand people witnessed the launching of
the steel Government boarding- boat
Golden Gate at the Moran Ship-building
Yards to-day. Tbe people made it a noli
day and turned out in great force, every
point of vantage and some that were not
points of vantage being occupied. When
the appointed hour drew near, standing
room was not to be had within the yards
nor alone tne sip leading to the deep
water. Tbe morning was cold and raw,
and the crowd shivered and stood with
chattering teeth, but few were willing to
forego the pleasure of seeing the launch
to peek relief by some glowine radiator.
The minute for tbe launching bad
been announced as 8:15 o'clock. Neither
the Morans nor any one else on earth
could control the tides. They took the tide
books as a guide, but alas ! tbe books were
wrong and the crowd was kept waiting
until noon. Atone minute past 12 o'clock
the Golden Gate, like a duck on tbe win;;,
took her course down toward her native
element. Two m nutes later tbe great
crowd was in motion toward the exit, and
immediately thereafter the yards wore
t heir accustomed appearance, as if noth
ing unusual had happened.
Judging from the vast coriteourse of peo
ple, the launching of the Golden Gbtewas
one of the most important events of lat
ter-day history of Seattle. Long before
ihe time set people were wemiing their
way out to the tide flats, where the ship
building yards are located, and were pre
senting their invitation cards at the office
of the Morans and being passed through
the doors. A crush was expec;ea, but not
so great a one as the reality proved to be.
It was not long before the improvised
seats an ' grand stand were overflowing.
A reception committee had been selected
to receive the more distinguished ones,
bin two or three such committees would
have utterly failed in an attempt to prop
erly act oat their parts.
Every preparation nad been nude to
have the Golden Gate take the water on
time to the minute. The ways, which
were substantially laid, had been copi
ously smeared with greese and beaswaz;
an immense hawser had been made fast
about the steamer from stem to stern and
wnh one end coUed at the water's edge so
thai it would piay out gradually as the
Vt-ssel moved out into derp water. A few
props were left, as if holding the craft
upon a lever, while the small rope holding
up the two heavy weiehts like pendulums
was in its place, and the never-to-be omit
ted bottle of wine, bedecked in the colors
of the American flag, hung over t.e bows.
The minute arrived, but the Golden
Gate did not move out. The tide was not
right. The great crowd, augmenting very
fast at this time, soon became aware of
store at Fifth and Market streets, com
mencing to-morrow, there will be held
there a perfect revelation sale in the line
of clothing and furnishing goods as re
gards prices which have been slashed, it
would appear, regardless of the real value
of the articles, which are high class and of
the finest quality throughout.
Summertield & Roman propose to be
known in future as the leading clothiers
not alone of this City, but of the Pacific
Coast, and in consequence will offer to
the public such rare inducements in their
line, both in price and quality of articles,
as to warrant this belief.
la consequence of the big sale that
the cause of the detention, and it was
soon noised about that 11:40 o'clock had
been announced as the probable moment
or cutting the small rope, in the mean
time the First Regiment band had been
discoursing some of its choicest numbers
trom a specially arranged platform near
by. The band occupied the attention of
the crowd for more than three full hours,
and played a score of pieces during the
interim. It was decidedly chilly, and the
musicians, wnen not playing, had enough
to do to keep the blood circulating prop
erly through their veins.
Whon 11:40 o'clock arrived Robert
Mcran and Manager McMurtrie de
scended the ways to the water and made
a careful inspection. The tide a short
time previous; y lacked about three feet of
being as high as they expected it would
be, but the decision of the examination of
the gauge was that the attempt at least be
made.
A dozen machinists and shipwrights
took stations aboard the Golden Gate to
be in readiness for any emergency. The
ship-carpenters, when the order was given,
jumped below with mallets and the merry
sound of knocking on the blocks and
wedges announced to tne crowd that the
time for the attempt bad come.
Twelve o'clock came and several big
whistles announced the hour. The crowd
set up a yell.
One minute past 12 o'clock and "There
she goes !' came from hundreds of throats.
Miss Henrira Augusta Munger, daughter
of Captain F. M. Munger, United States
revenue service and Government in
spector on detail of the GolJen Gate, had
cut the small cord, the weights had fallen
into their resting-place, the champ: gne
bottle crashed and the Golden Gate
moved toward the water. At first with a
motion scarcely perceptible, then faster
and with a grand rusb, fanning the wind
and next the water, the vessel took her
plunge and came up bounding like a rub
ber bali.
ARRAIGNED AT BAKERSFIELD.
Preliminary Examination of Ed Willow,
the Slayer of the Notorious Percy
Doug/as.
BAKEIISFIELD, Cal., Feb. 13.â The
examination of E i Willow on the charge
of murdering Percy Douglas here on the
evening of January 29 took place to-day
before Justice Fox. About a dozen wit
nesses were examined. Several testified
that they bad heard Douglas threaten
diro injury to Willow, and that he "would
fix him" when the occasion arrived.
Some of these threats were heard a few
hours before the killine. The case closed
with Willow's statement, and the court
'postponed its decision until next Wednes
day afternoon.
â¢"'1 had not been in Annie Hicks' room,
in the Attjletic building, long,' : said Wil
low, "until Annie screamed and said,
'There comes Percy.' I went to the door
and said. 'Don't come in here.' Percy
jumped back and started to draw nia re
volver. He got it about half out, I think,
and then I fired. I then went to the
kitchen and told Annie to light tbe lamp.
At this time my dog came up with Doug
las' hat. 1 looked into the hall and saw
Douglas lying there. I halloed out for
some one to co for a doctor. After this I
took Miss Hicks do- n to the Palm Gar
den.
"I bad been told by several that Douglas
was af ler me, I bought the shotgun a few
days before the killing â about the time
Douslas drew a pistol on Officer Oswald.
I bouerbt it to protect myself. Last April
Jake F. Laitz told me Percy had threaten
ed me, and that created much uneasiness
in my mind."
"You don't suppose that Percy Douglas
wanted to shoot you?" asked the prose
cution.
"I certainly did."
"If you were innocent why did you
refuse to make a statement to the report
er* immediately after the shooting when
asked?" questioned John Douglas, brother
of the deceased.

WOOED A WIDOW
FOR HER WEALTH
One of the Smith Family-
Practices Fraud in
Los Angeles.
Swindles a Gray-Haired Woman
Who Accepted His Proposal
of Marriage.
Her Home Mortgaged to Meet the
Young Mm's R quest for a
Small Loan.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 13.â ThÂ«
susceptibility of the occasional widow,
especially if she be advanced in years, to
the wiles of the male adventurer has been
strikingly exemplified here in tbe case of
Mrs. Harriet B. Stanley and a scapegoat
by the wild, weird name ot Smith. If the
story related by this white-haired dame of
60 can be legally substantiated she has
been the victim of one of the "smoothest"
swindles that has yet been investigated
by the authorities.
Mrs. Stanley lives on Pearl street, own
ing the property whereon she resides. A
few months ago Smith called at her house.
He stated that he was a neighbor of Mrs.
Stanley's and made quite a pleasant Im
pression upon the old lady. The ac
quaintanceship thus begun was assidu
ously cultivated by Smith, and every time
he called Mrs. Stanley liked him better.
He told her of his wealthy father and of
his various business venture?, incidentally
referring to the lumber business. One
day he seemed quite sad, and it developed
chat slipping through his tingers was a
chance to go into the lumbe- basines-.
He was short a paltry $300. He proposed
that Mrs. Stanley loan him that amount,
and she readily agreed to do so, taking
his note for tbe sum.
Soon after this transaction bmith pro
fessed the most ardent affection for tie
wealthy widow, concluding with a propo
sal of marriage. Mrs. Stanley told him
that she was old enough to be bis mother,
but he soothingly tola her ihat that "cut
no ice," and that if she would be his bride
age was not a factor in the arrangement.
Smith disclosed to Mrs. Stanley that he
had paid for a cottage all but $700. As
they were so soon to be married, and as
everything he had was hers, it would ce
ment the union to have the place clear of
incumbrance.
Mrs. Stanley mortgaged her Pearl
street residence to give him the $700.
After this Smith deserted his victim
and auit the city. The blow aimost killed
the unsuspecting old lady. She consulted
friends, and toe attention of the authori
ties was called to the case. As a result a
warrant has been issued for Smith's
arrest.

Against Dan Murphy's Coyote

Some California-bred hotrnds were yes

"Why, a collar like that," said Mr. Murphy, ''would wind any dog."
pack of imported English fox hunters in j
a spirited run across six miles of hilly >
and undulating country to the southward j
of San Mateo and Belmont. A company \
of Burlinsame Club horsemen started !
with the chase and trailed along the
course much according to the ability of !
their horses and the temerity of their '
riders.
It was a fox hunt in name only, but the
twenty English hounds, true to their in
stinct, confidently and with unfailing
zeal pursued a trail over whicfl a flunky
on horseback had dragged a fox-scented
sack an hour before. A coyote skin had
also been trailed along "the proposed
course as a special inducement to the
California hounds, which, though used to
sighting their prey, ran comparatively
well until toward the end of the chase
when they finally refused longer to take
an interest in tne pursuit of an animal of
which they had not even once caught a
glimpse.
The California dogs were from big
ranches. They were coyote-trailers and
fighters by choice and by long experience.
Tnere were six of them, the pick of fifteen
pairs belonging to Dan M. Murphy and to
James Sargent Jr., at their places near
Gilroy, over sixty miles away. Their
owners had brought them to the hunt
confident of their ability and hopeful that
they would be among ths first along the
â¢cent.
"When the run was ended they were still
sure of ths merit of their coyote fighters,
for they did not consider that the test had
been conclusive where only a manufac
tured trail had been offered. Another
race in the near future will be tne result.
The starting place was near the crossing
of the Fescadero and Crystal Springs
loads in the partiaLy wooded, smooth,
green hills back from San Mateo about
four miles. There the trail began.
There congregated the dozen riders that
would follow the hounds, the few reck
less drivers in buggies that would dash
along the roadways most convenient to
the general course of the chase, and the
few passive spectators that would pee the
start and then return leisurely to Burlin
parue to await tntÂ» home-coming of the
huntsmen and the bounds in the evening.
Mr. Murphy's black and tan hounds
had been brought to the spot in a wagon.
Mr. Hobart's black and white spotted
English trail followers had as usual with
them come trotting together in a well
behaved and easiiv controlled pack.
They are off ! Walter Hobart, as master
of the hunt and with horn in hand, fol
lows close behind the low baying pack
that with noses near the turf rushes up
over a hillside and disappears.
H. H. Hinshaw, L. McCreary and Cap
tain Wainwright as whips are among the
leaders, too, and near "them gallop Joe
Grant, H. Wheeler, J. Lawson, Mr. Page
and several others, all on light horses,
with docked mane and tail. Mr. Murphy,
in a small cart, is already far along on the
winding road near one point of which the
hunt will pass. After him, with racing
speed, go Mr. and Mrs. E. D. Beylard in
â¢ light little buggy, and others follow.
Dan Murphy waited aimoit breathlessly
near a turn in the road. With his hand
to his ear he listened for the oncoming
pack. From far over a hill, and only
faintly wafted on the late aftemoou
breeze, came a quick, hoarse yelp, along
with similar sounds of less volume.
"Ah, that's my George; I know his
Toicel" impulsively ejaculated Mr. Mur
phy. "I thought he'd be in the lead."
In a moment more a distant bald hilltop
bristled with a lew scurrying figures out
lined against the sky, and then the pack
came straggling aown the long slope, fol
lowed presently by the first of the riders
and later by others that appeared one
after another up over the crest of the hill.
The hounds came nearer and Mr. Mur
phy strained his eyes to discover his black
and-tans among the leaders. Hot on the
trail, the English dogs swept across the
Intervening level space and turned up an
other hillside. Twelve of them had
passed before one of the black-and-tana
came along witn h>3 mate leading the rest
of the pack. Mr. Murphy sighed at the
sight. Some one had iÂ»-f t the big heavy
collars on his dogs. What wonder that
they were not at the very lead?
A halt was called a few moment? amid
snapping of whips and blowing of horns,
and after a short wait the trait was again
taken up. At the next passing place, two
miles beyond, one of the California black
and tans, without his collar, was the lirst
to cross the road, and men his owner watt
satisfied. He felt repaid for the long,
hard, uphill drive he had had past the
gaping crowd at the County Poorhouse,
on past the big dam â one of the sources of
San Francisco's water supply â and up the
winding grade to the summit overlooking
distant B?lmont, that was to be tne end
of the chase.
Some of the horses were tried at ridica
lousiy low prearranged obstacles aloiicrthe
route. The foremost usuahy and quite
fortunately knocked tnem down before
the straggling huntsmen behind could
risk a leap. The ground was, however,
scarcely suited to jumping because oi
the insecure footing, but the day was per
fect for a brisk, exhilarating chase after
the hounds.

in the last few years it is unlinely that Mr.
Cleveland will realize much more from
the sale of Woodley than he gave for it.
His former purchase of a country resi
dence netied aim about $100, 000 and gave
the neighborhood a boom that resulted
in most of the land bciiig quicfciy dis
posed of at nigh profit* to the owners.
With a home in New York City, an
other at Princeton and a summer resi
dence on Buzzards Bay Mr. Cleveland will
be well provided.
Mr. Cleveland's fortune has been vari
ously estimated, but those who have
made tbe most conservative figuring place
it at not more thau $1,000,000.
They Took the High Fences in Superb Style.
His three homes, it is claimed, repre
sent at least $200,000, and be haÃ other
property which brings his real-estate hold
ings up to $500,000.
During his eight years in the White

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1897.
ROUND UP OF
CHINESE CLUBS
Over Five Hundred China
men Arrested in Gam
bling-Houses.
Fifteen f quads Make Simul
taneous Raids With Sig
nal Success.
Officers Rummage Through the Effects
cf Alleged Sccia' Organiza
tions for Evidence.
The strong arm of 'he law smote China
town with a resounding whack last night.
and in the clutches of its greedy fingers
grasped enough yellow malefactors to
make the cells of the California street sta
tion look like a badly overcrowded
menagerie. The law was represented by
fifty-five sturdy officers selected by Cap
tain Wittman for special adaptability to
the work in hand, and they performed
their duties witn neatness and dispatch.
The special objects of last night's raid
were the incorporated social clubs. These
organizations, under a supposed protec
tion from their charters, nave been carry
ing on tan games and lotteries with im
punity, and the authorities determined to
test the law on the matter. For three
days Captain Wittman has been engaged
in obtaining a list of these places and get
ting out John Doe search warrants.
The exact time of the n>:d was not
known to any but Chief Crowley and Cap
tain Wittman until 9 o'clock last night.
At that hour the officers who hail been in
structed to report to Captain Wittman
were given their details.
It was arranged that exactly at 9:45 each
squad was to enter the place assigned to
it. This programme was carried out to
the letter and the heathens were tuken
completely by surprise.
In many of the places the inmaies man
aged to make away witn the evidences of
gambling, but in several clubs the officers
made big hauls. By 12 o'clock 5 1 0 men
had beeii brought to the police station and
a few score were corralled in their clubs
awaiting the patrol wagons, which had
more than they could attend to.
The places raided and the officers de
tailed to each were as follows:
817 Washington, Sergeant Shea and Officers
Bally, Bunner, Hurd; 823 Washington, Ser
geant Hopper, Officers Peters, Connolly, Mc
laughlin; 824 Washington, three game's, Ser
geaut Ileims, Officers Williams, Long, Thomp

SPOKANE, Wash., Feb. 13.â As the
gambling games in the Cceur d'Alene
saloon in this city were preparing for busi
ness at 6:30 o'clock last evening a stranger
quietly picked up the sack containing the
bank for the keno game, stepped to the
door and leaped down the stairs, shout
ing: "Out of the way I" as he went.
lie reached the barroom and went
through it, running into men at every
| step; ran outside the door and disap
peared down an alley. Although the em
ployes of the game were all armed, as were
scores of men who were in the rooms and
saloon, not a weapon wis drawn.
So sudden was the robbery that no one
realized what was going on until the man
bad gone. Neither he nor the bank hare
been seen since There was about $95 in
the sack. It was the boldest robbery ever
perpetrated here.

POLICEMAN BODE'S
COURAGEOUS FIGHT
He Has a Hard Tussle
With Two Determined
Burglars.
As a Result One of Them Now
Reclines at Leisure in
tte Tanks.
Peculiar Action of a Police Juige
Which Mystifies the
Police.
Early Thursday morning Officer E. F.
Bode detected two men in tne act of
"burgling" James McDonald's dry-goods
store nt 2800 Mission street. They had
secured some booty from that establish
ment and also from the store of John
Nicholson in the same building.
Bode called upon the men to surrender,
when they started to run. He grappled
with one of them, who, although little
more than a boy, proved to be a sinewy
and lithe customer and inadea hard tight.
While the officer was struggling with
his man the other drew a revolver and
came close to the combatants, bis inten
tion being to use It when a favorable op
portunity presented itself. The officer
managed, however, to free one arm, and
knocked the man with the revolver down
by a well-directed blow. His weapon
flew off to one side as he tall.
The fellow of whom Bode had hold took
advantage of the opportunity offered, and
as the other man fell tripped the officer
up. The two then closed in on him and
endeavored~to pound him into insensi
bility, bat be managed to regain his feet
and make things so interesting that the
one who bad drawn the revolver took to
his heels.
It required only a few moments to
brine the other burglar into submission
and snap the bracelets on his wrists. He
was taken to tbe Southern station and
locked up on a charge oÂ» burglary.
He there gave the police the name of
Henry Gilmore and bis age as 16 years. It
has been discovered that his real name is
Chester.
Bode, although suffering from the blows
he had received, attended Judge Low's
court on Friday morning, a-nd after hear
ing the evidence tbe Judge held Henry to
answer before the Superior Court in $7000
bonds.
Henry is said to be the son of a wealthy
captain and shipowner in Portland and
last night inquiry was made about him at
the Seventeenth-street station. Captain
Gillen said he had been held to answer
before tbe Superior Court and had proba
bly been transferred to the Cocnty Jail
unless he had procured bonds for his re
lease.
At thÂ« City Prison it was ascertained
that Judge Low had, shortly after holding
Henry to answer before the Superior
Court, released him from the City Prison,
and yesterday morning on tbe court cal
endar the case was marked "dismissed"

CALABASAS WATER CASE.
Old-Time Disputants Again in Court to
Sett/c a Troub.e With Many
Peculiar Phases.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 13.â Leon
Gazave and Manuel Dominguez, residents
ot classic Calabasas, who formerly in
dulged in the exhilarating pastime of
U3ing each other as targets for pisrol prac
tice, are in the courts once more in a new
and unique relation. Gazave proved a bit
reckless on "the held of honor," wound
ing a constable by the name of Brans
comb. Dominguez also stopped a few of
Gazave' s stray balls.
Dominguez in the present action seeks
judgment lor $1000 damages for alleged
interference with hi 3 water rights and for
an injunction to prevent further inter
ference. The plaintiff claims that he
entered upon unsurveyed Government
land that no oneelae claimed, has im
proved it and occupiea it with hi 3 family
to th?s day. Upon one corner of the land
he discovered a spring and developed it.
He succeeded in securing a flow of one
miner's inch, piped the water to hi 3 house
and used it !or bis domestic wants.
In August, 1893, he posted a notice
claiming the water, laid a line of pices
built a tank and felt very thankful that
?Â£>?â¢Â£ a good Wllter Â»Â«PPÂ»y. In February,
1895, Dominguez claims, Gazave broke up
his water pipes and tank, and while en
gaged m repairing the damage done, a
mob of men, among them Gazave, as
saulted and beat him, "riddled his body
with builets," knocted his wife down and
drove him away from the spring, threat
ening him with violence if he tried to
take the watÂ«r again.
Upon the witness-stand this forenoon
Dominguez produced an old note bearing
the Pignature of Leon Gazave, ana stated
that thÂ« defendant before he entered upon
he showed Gazave how to "jump it."
Irooi the demeanor of the plaintiff it
was evjdent that he believed he had
warmed a snake in his bosom in thus eiv
mg Gazave a start in life.

LITIGATION AT FRESNO.
Suit io Compel a Canvass of Returns of
the Sunset Irr/gat/cn District
Election.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 13.â The Sunset
Irrigation District appears to be very pro
vocative oi litigation. Another suit in
volving the affairs of the district has been
tiled in tbe Superior Court, and it would
be a daring vaticinator who would proph
esy that it was the last one.
The complainant is George 1L Kohlerof
this city and the defendants, W. G. fccoti,
E. F. Miicneil, John N. Kinc, C. S. Camp
bell and Milton McWhorter, who cousti
tute the old board of directors of the dis
trict. Kohler recites that on Wednesday,
February 3, 1897. an election was held in
the district lor the purpose of choosing a
new board o f directors and other officers.
L. H. Martin, C. S. Campbell, Milton Me-
Whorter, J. N. King and Joseph Meadows
received the niajcnty-of all the legal votes
cast and were duly and regularly elected
members of the board of directors. Re
turns were duiy made to the secretary of
the board, J. N. Kine, and the old board
should have met on trie nrst Monday after
the election for the purpose of canvassing
the vote.
This, Kohler claims, the directors failed
to do, and at ail times since they have
failed and refused to perform their duty.
He therefore prays for a writ of man
damus commanding the defendants to
meet and canvass the returns of the elec
tion and declare the result thereof, and
that the secretary enter upon the records
the names of the several persons elected.
Judge Webb ordered that the writ issue,
the defendants to show cause on February
25, at 10 o'clock.

THE THEATERS
WILL GIVE AID
Burns' Memory Revered
Among the Ranks of
Thespians.
The Alcazar Management's Offer
to Do Anything That Is
Suggested.
A Big Benefit Will Be Arranged if the
Matter Is Favorab y Received
by the Scots.
The movement to raise a fitting monu
ment to the memory of Kobert Burns, the
great Scotch poet, has gone beyond the
bounds that originally confined it and
bids fair to become a popular measure in
which the entire City will take an interest.
The theatrical people, always warm
hearted and sympathetic in a good cause,
have taken the matter up, and will con
tribute to the fund that has already
grown to quite respectable proportions.
Messrs. Belasco & La Faille, the lessees
and managers of the Alcazar Theater,
talked the matter over yesterday and
decided that they would contribute their
mite toward the fund by giving a grand
benefit whenever the committee in charge
of the financial problem sees fit to name
the date on which it will be moat con
venient and profitable to the fund.
Appreciating the aid given by The Call
to the Scots of San Francisco in agitating
the monument proposition, the letter was
addressed to the editor.
There are few among the legitimate
Thespians of this City who are not
familiar with and admirers of the poet,
and one of the managers of the theater
made special pilgrimage to the home of
the poet several years ago while on a
European tour.
It is probable that if a benefit is ar
ranged it will be within a short time and
those who attend will be sure of a treat.
Next week that side-splitting comedy
"A Piece of Paper" will be out on at the
Alcazar for a week, and following that
"Saints and Sinners," a play well and
favorably known to the theater-going
public.
No effort will be spared by the manage
ment and the public to make the benefit
all that it should be, ana it is quite likely
that something appropriate in the way of
orchestral music will be arranged.
Those of the Scotch colony who have
been intrusted with the work of putting
the lund committee on a thorough word
ing basis have not been idle, and at the
meeting on Thursday evening next a con
stitution and by-laws will be submitted
for its guidance.
The fund already contains nearly $2000.
contributed by enthusiastic Scotchmen,
and with this nucleus to begin with, little
difficulty in securing the remainder is an
ticipated. When the committee is thor
oughly organized, entertainments of all
kinds will be arranged, and the work of
lore carried on in a systematic manner.
SHAKESPEARE, GAY OR SAD
Business Man and Student Give
Their Views of
Him
Thomas Magee and Professor Gay ley
Entertain an Audience a Golden
Gate Hall.
A business man and a professor of the
University of California expressed their
sentiments concerning Shakespeare before
a large audience for the benefit of the Mer
cantile Library Auxiliary Thursday even
ing at Golden Gate Hali. It was supposed
mat the estimate of ttie business man and
that of the student would serve as a foil,
each for the other. As it developed, how
ever, ; tie admiration of the business man
was expressed in much the warmer and
more sympathetic lerros.
The business man was Thomas Magee.
the student Professor Charles Mills Gay
ley of the State university.
Professor Gayley was allotted the 6rst
fortv-hve minutes, in which he rapidly
ran througn the course of Shaicesoeare s
development as revealed in his play>. He
said it was far from him and should be
from all to Bimpiy fan down before and
cry, "Oh. Thou!" to Shakespeare and all
that he did simply because it was Shakes
peare. Shakespeare could best be appre
ciated by being known intimately. All
that he did was by no means on a plane.
He developed like all otner great poets;
he did not soar into the literary sky a full
fledged eaele, althougn, ii.deed, an eaelÂ«.
Professor Gayley divid d Shakespeare's
development into four periods â the first
the period of germs, as illustrated oy the
work done between 1588 and 1594; the
second the period of growth and freedom
and development, from 1595 to 1601; the
third the period of darknes, from 1601 to
1607, and the fourth the period of light,
reconciliation ami higher happiness, from
1608 to the time of his death, 1616.
In the first j-ta;;e i 9 sbown the humor of
boyish vigor, the healthy, hearty boyish
ness of young Will Shakespeare. Here is
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 14. 1897.
the witoftheDun and of repartee. It is
the mechanical situation and* the humor
that makes the characters laugh. Later
the characters, grown to be flesh and
blood, laugh of themselves for very merri
ment.
Toe next two stages illustrate the com
edy of types â the comedy of charade r.
The third period produces no comedy
or nothing heavier than "Measure for
Measure" and "All's Well That Ends
Well." The fourth period discovers the
greatest comedy of all â the comedy of
ideals. In the first period are found the
"Comedy of Errors," "Love's Labor
Lost," "Two Gentlemen of Verona." In
the second are the "Taming of the
Shrew" and the Falstaff plays; the third,
the character comedies: the comedies of
real life, discover "As You Line It,"
"Twelfth Night," "Much Ado About
Nothing." The fourth perioa developed
those of various dramatic productions,
the romantic dramas, the comedy of
ideals such as the "Winter's Tale."
We see in the more somber plays the
spirit 0/ a man who has passed through
the valley of the shadow and in his later
comedies a humor representing the broad
est sympathies; it is of a man who has
sunk his plummet into the depth of hu
man experience and embraces the world
with never-failing arms.
Thomas Mapeo went directly to his sub
ject when introduced. He placed Shake
speare next to the Bible. He named as
the world's four great geniuses in litera
ture Shakespeare, E&chylus, Sophocles and
Euripides and the greatest of these
Shakespeare. To read the Greeks, he said,
was like embracing the cold beauty of
tneir marble images rather than placing
one's arms about a loved woman in
reading Shakespeare, he dealt in human
life. It is a joy to study the woman of
Shakespeare, ne said. Remembering how
Shakespeare began his married life in a
mistake and how he atonedâ he never
forgot his home.
Shacespeare, like all great men, was
produced in a time of world throes, at a
time when the air was aflame with poetry,
out of which Shakespeare rose as the great
particular genius.
Mr. Magee denounced the Baconian the
ory as absurd, and closed wit a reference
to the Sonnets, in which, little tipprec -
ated as they were generally, Shakespeare
was still Skakespeare. f

TO BE HANGED
ON WEDNESDAY
Chun Sing to Pay the Death
Penalty for Three
Murders.
He Savagely Brained His Vic
tims With an Ax in Mono
County.
Prison Directors Ask for a Pardon
for Thomas Sullivanâ The Grain*
Bag Industry.
At the meeting of the State Prison
Directors at San Quentin yesterday the
report wa* made tliat everything has been
prepared for the execution of Chun Sing
on next Wednesday within the prison
walls. The gallows operate like clock
work, the rope is being stretchea to insure
no mistake or bungle at thp execution and
the death watch is now placed upon the
Chinaman whose bands are dyed fonrfold
in human blood.
The crime, or rather three crimes, for
which Sing is to pay the forfeiture of bis
life, were particularly atrocious. He is a
large, powerfully built fellow and his acts
show him to be as desperate and reckless
as be is powerful. In the fall of 1895 Sing
went to the house of Ah P\>ok, in the
town of Lundy, Jfono County, and
assaulted him with an ax.
He literally hacked the fellow to pieces
and left him only when he thought that
Fook was de:id, but in time the victim re
covered. Fook's wife ran screaming from
the bloody scene, but Sing overtook her
and brained her with the Â«ame weapon.
Tne woman's screams brought two more
Chinese, a man called Charlie Fai and a
CliineÂ«e woman whos" name is not known
to the prison officials, to the premises.
They shared a similar fate, the three
rrrtirders being committed within five
minutes.
Sing was captured and. lodged in the
County Jail in BouiÂ»Â», but wlii'e awaiting
his trial he made en assault upon the
jailer in an effort to escape ai:d nearly
killed that official. The d*Â»a'h sentence
was pronounced in December, 1895. Ah
Fook was one of the principal witnesses
Since Sing has been at San Quentin he
has not given any demonstration of his
tavage propensities, but be is watched
closely for all that.
In connection with the execution there
is one feature that is decidedly out ot the
common, and thai is that it will take
place on Wednesday instead of on Friday,
which is by custom the proper day to
drop murderers into eternity.
The prison directors decided to recom
mend that the Governor grant a pardon
to Thomas Sullivan, who is serving a
fourteen-year sentence for robbery. Sulli
van is a rough railroad laborer, but the
directors do not believe that he is guilty
of the crime for which he was convicted.
A little over six years ago County Treas
urer Baker of Kern County was Assaulted
in Bakersneid by a gany of rubbers, but
he escaped after killing one of the rogues.
Several persons were arrested on jnispi
cion, Sullivan among the number. Upon
the statement of a cellmate that Sullivan
i bad told of certain facts concerning tbe
j attempted robbery Sullivan was convicted.
Baker has repeatedly stated that he did
not believe that the accused was one of
the robbers. However, the District Attor
ney of Kern protested against the grant
ing of a pardon and the directors did not
feel at liberty to make a recommendation
for it until the protest was withdrawn,
which was done recently. They believe
that if Sullivan is not pardoned he will
become crazy, as his mind has become af
fected by brooding over his troubles. Sul
livan das served half of his term, allowing
for credits for good behavior.
Very favorable reports were received
upon the work: in the jutemili. Under
the new management r ere are more bags
and oi a better quality turned out daily
than at any time during the preceding
year. The disc pline amone the prisoners
in the mill is excellent and they are doing
good work.
The Warden was authorized to sell
1,000,000 grain baes at $4 75 per hundred.

return soon. >
IN THE NICK OF TIME.
Prospectors Discover a Rich Ledge M
They Were Selling Out.
E. Avery McCarthy of the McCarthy
Real Estate Company of this City has re
ceived a letter from his father, James P.
McCarthy, bead of the company, who is
now in Handsbiir â , in which he tells of a
recent very rich strike made tnere.
The letter says tnat the writer was in
the act of purchasing a mining claim from
three young men who had been prospect
ing the desert for four years. The price
agreed upon was $2000 and all arrange
ments for the tran fer had been made.
Before signing the agreement, however,
the yount; men took a saunter over
their claim and accidentally discovered a
remarkably rich ledge, the best, the writer
says, yet found in the section. Tbat night
they were offered $25,000 ior their claim,
but preferred to bold it. McCarthy, who
is conducting a branch real estate office
in R:indsburg, is proprietor of an adjoin
ing claim, which has been successfully
opened up.

pirased to m^et with his friends unarr
such pleasant circumstances and he would
meet them again next year if he does not
die, a thin;; that ha dots not propose to do
for many years to come.
Then lie spoke of the Columbus Savings
and Loan Society, a commercial organiza
tion of which he was j>roud to be tne
founder and which sprung into existence
in rive days. In 1893 it started with
$300,000 capital, and for all that the times
were depressed tuere were $63,000 paid up
on the capital stock.
On the 6th inst. the books showed that
the bank lurniture and fixtures amounted
to $1007 75, the secured loans amounted
to $479,003 32, money in bank to $55 003 27,

increase of loans in the' same lime, $94,

$31,568 37.
This excellent showing caused a br.rst
of applause, and ihe president resumed
by saying that so long as Jie holds the
position every depositor will receive his
just dues. He c included by usking Dr.
Jo&enh Pescia to officiate a* toastmaster.
After a few appropriate remart?, in
which Dr. Pescia stated that everything
that Mr. Fugazi laid his hands uion suc
ceeded, he spoke of another officer of the
bank to whom great credit is due for its
â uccess.
He named the secretary. F. L. Belgrano,
anil paid him a high compliment for Ins
great ability and his fidelity to the inter
ests of the society. He a'so paid compli

Palmieri, Treasurer U. Co~ta and Direc
tors Isaiah W. Hellman St., Ant. Chichi
sola. Joseph Cuneo, George G. Caglieri, G.
Bacigaiupi and Francesco Arata.
He concluded by calling upon I. W.
Hellman Sr., president of the Nevada
Bank. Mr. Hellman, in a short address,
stated that there is no bank in the City in
a better condition than the bank under
consideration, and that the Italian colony
it givine it a splendid support. F. Pelle

!TT IS AGONIZING to think how many such bright, happy

D. B. Woolf, secretary to the Supreme
Court Commissioners, is at Sacramento
with a big budget of statistics for the en
lightenment of those legislators who may
desire information as to the work of that
body during the discussion of the bill to
continue It 3 life. The Supreme Court
Commission will, as such, die in May of
this year unless the bill passes.
The bill provides for the continuance of
the commission for four years more. The
business of the commission is to assist the
Supreme Court in its work. The court
assigns to it such ca&cs as it sees fit, and
the Coinmissionei , uudy these cases and
present the result of thair study in the
form of written opinions for the considera
tion of the court.
There are four Commissioners, Belcher,
Haynes, Searles and Britt; seven Justices
âBeatty (Chief Justice), McFarland, Har
rison, Garoutte, Temple, Van Fleet and
Henshaw. Commissioner Van Clief â the
law provided for five â died November 29,
1895. The Justices go over the work of
the Commissioners, sometimes agreeing
with it and sometimes, not often, remod
eling or wholly disagreeing with it.
It is quite the thing, even among at
torneys, to smile when the Supreme Court
is mentioned as "working." During the
last days of the late Grand Jury it held
an open session at which County Attorney
Creswell was invited to be present and
tender advice upon the subject under dis
cussion and this matter of the Supreme
Court "working" was spoken oi and raised
quite a laugh.
CresweJl refused utterly to join it. In
deed he took the occasion to moralize
upon this habit of the thoughtless of jok
ing about the Judges and the courts.
He thought it ought to be discouraged ;
ti:at it had a decidedly evil tendency, and
grew out of a misapprehension of the facts.
As for himself he knew that the Justices
of the Supreme Court labored as many
TREBELLI CHARMS
A SECOND TIME
Excellent Concert Given at
the California
Theater.
The Ycung Vccalist Sings Oper
atic Arias and Simp c
tongs.
Htrr Weiss, a New 'Cellist, Makes a j
G:cd Impressionâ Louis Crepaux
Applaulcd.
Mile. Trebelli's second concert, which
took place yesterday afternoon at the Cal
ifornia Theater, was as treat an artistic
treat to lovers of singing as her TuesJay
night's recital. The more one bears this
remarkable young singer the more one
learns to appreciate the exquisite natural
qualities of her voice and the finish of her
art. Mile. Trebelli *as assisted yesterday
afternoon by Mons. Louis Crepaux, basso,
and by Herr Arthur Weiss, a violoncellist
recently arrived from Europe, who made
a very favorable impression.
As a rule when a concert singer, pur et
simple, essays an operatic aria, the result
is at best a cold, mechanical rendering,
devoid of any dramatic interpretation.
This is by no means the case with Antoin
ette Trebelli, however. Sbe sang the
well-known "Ah, forse lvi," from "La
Traviaia," with all the operatic expres
sion of a prima donna who is thoroughly
at home in the role of Yioletta. The same
is albo true of her rendering of "Alleluia,"
the Infanta's aria from "Lo Cid." Her
singing was so dramatic that one almost
saw the stage and the Infanta distributing
alms outside the cathedral on Easter
morning. No doubt her power of dramatic
interpretation is largely owing to herhav- j
ing lived in an atmosphere of operatic art |
tiom childhood.
While sbe possesses this dramatic gift
of the prima donna, Mile. Trebelli hat
been spared the wear and tear that opera
involves on the voice, and as a conse
quence her riob sweet organ has the fresh
ness, purity and coloratura that are rarely
heard nowadays in conjunction with dra
matic singing. The audience received
both her operatic arias with warm ap
plause. As an encore to the scene and
aria from the "Traviata" Trebelli sang
"Une Nuit d'Espagne," by Massanet.
In the florid vocal embroideries of the
"VUlauelle," by Eva dell' Aqua, Trebelli
showed her remarkable vocal agility, and
in this song her perfect intonation was
made more noticeable by the long pieces
of fioratura which she had to sing without
accompaniment. The tours de force in
this song brought a clamorous demand

hours as the average lawyer or other pro
fessional or business man It was (he
general impression that the work of the
Supreme Court consisted in sitting on the
bench for a couple of hours morning and
afternoon. The fact was, he said, that
was the least part of their work. He hap
pened to live in the same neighborhood
with a Justice of the Bupreine Court, and
could testify that he rode home reeularly
every evening on the same car that carried
as well others who are accustomed to late
dinners.
"Probably from his club," remarked a
juryman.
"No, sir, he came from the Supreme
Court rooms," insisted Creswell.
So much for the County Attorney's
wholly volunteer testimony. It is in line
with the data referred to, which, of course,
covers the labors of the Justices as well as
the Commissioners.
The fact is the Justices of the Supreme
Court arri\Â»e at tneir room*, some of them,
as early as 8:30 every morning and re
main there, some of them, as late as 6
o'clock every evening. Every evening in
tnis case means every evening â that is, it

Boy," which she sang with deligiitfu!
t archness of expression. Another vf her
i encores was Tosti's "Penso," to which
j she played her own accompaniment in a
I very effective manner.
There was no doubt about the good
measure given by Mile. Trebelli, for In
addition to all the above numbers shealso
sang a romanza by Mascagni, "Pena d 1
Amore." Grieg's "Good Morning" and
Goring Thomas' "Song of Bansbine." In
everything except the "Penso" she was
sympathetically accompanied by J.
Marrion.
Herr Arthur Weiss maie quite an im

sessed of great fluency of execution, which
he showed especially in tt:e rapiil chro

M. Louis Crepaux, wlio is weil known in
San Francisco musical circles, contributed
some good vocal numbers, which were
thoroughly appreciated. He opened the
concert with Martini's "Plaisir n'Araor,"
and as an encore sang an aria from Saint
! Saens' "Henry VIIi." His other nam hers
j and the encores which he was compelled
to give to thorn were: "Nous Nous A ni
erons;" "IciÃas," by C. L. Hess and "Pius
Blanche est Mon Amour," by Grieg.
Mile. Trebelli trill give her last concert
at the California Theater to-night.
A Music Festival.
Four California oratorio societies have
decided to combine in order to give a
music festival during the month of April.
These societies are the San Francisco and
San Jose oratorio societies, members of
the Oakland Oratorio Society and the
Alameda society, which recently gave
"The Messiah." under the conductorship
of Edward Crandail.
The leading feature of the festival will
be a grand performance of "The Mes
siah," and the other concerts will consist
of selections from well-Known oratorios.
Mine. Geneva Bisbop, one of the best
known oratorio singers in America, will
come from Chicago as the soprano soloist.
She has sung extensively in the East and
in Europe. During her sojourn in the
British Isles she passed some lime with
Patti at Craig-y-Nos. Negotiations with
other Eastern soloists are also in progress.
Singers of moderate ability will be re
ceived in the chorus. James Hamilton
Howe will conduct and Bernhard Mollen

Ward P. Winchell, passed assistant en

j Callao, stating that a day or two before
i Christinas th.i officers of the ship went
I over the celebrated Meiggs road in the

The officers of th. j Pmladelphia were the

ine the year 26 rehearings were granted
and 192 denied.
In 1895 the total number of opinions
filed was 715; in 1894 the number was 784;
1893, 724; in 1892, 613; in 1891. 717; in lÂ«) 0.
715; in 1889, 624. During the last five y ars
the Justices rendered 2091 opinions; the
Commissioners 1397.
The total causes filed in the eight years
past numbered 6575. The total judgments
in the sams eight years numbered 6948,
showing that the court is creeping up on
the work, rather than that the work is
everreaching it. The same is true of the
separate work of the Commissioners. The
judgments rendered from January 1, 1889,
to December 31, 1896. numbered 6942;. the
cau?es filed in the same period, 6575.
The gain of judgments over filings was
368. The nurcber of cares riled during the
past four years exceeded by Â£23 the num
there in all variety. In some places tb#re '
would be two streams running toward
the same point, one white and silvery
shilling pure in the sun, and the other
aarthy and dark and muddy with t c red

when they mingled and dashed on to
gether ttie white one never turned t'te
other one white, and thereby hangs an
old, old moral as true to-day as it was
centuries ago, before it was worn thread
bare by the preachers."

RYE DAYS GRANTED.
Attorney Spelling Object* to Justice of
the Fence Groezi iiger's Killing.
A. T. Henderson, the plaintiff in the
suit of Henderson vs. Peter Feutrier, has
applied for a writ of certiorari 1o compel
Justice of the Peace Groezinger to enter
judgment at the conclusion of the trial
"as by law required."
Attorney Spelling alleges that at the
clo<e of the proceedings he dren the at
tention of Justice Groezineer to the law
and a-ked that judgment be rendered at
once, but that "then and there said Jus
tice of the Peace refused to grant said
motion, saying he would give tivo days'
stay of execution, though he might over
ride the Supreme Court."
The matter was referred to Presiding
Judte fcieawell, and be has directed Jus
tice Groezinger to show cause why the pe
tition of Mr. Henderson should not be
granted.
SPEEDING LITIGATION.
Hiring a State - Senator as Attorney
Does Not Secure Delay.
Judge Seawell has decided that a liti
gant has no right to demand a postpone
ment of a trial until his attorney comes
back from his work as a member of the
Legislature at Sacramento.
In the case of Ames against Frost in the
court of Justice of the Peace Carroll the
defendant objected to going to trial on
the ground that his attorney is Senator
Eugene F. Bert, who is not able to be
present in this City because he is serving
the State in the Legislature, and cannot
get back until after that body adjourns.
Justice Carroll was disposed to grant
the delay, but J udge Seawell was appealed
to, and he said this was not a legal ground
for a continuance; so the defendant must
speak for himself or get another attorney
and let the trial go on.
Paid Too Much for the Furniture.
Magda Rickett and her nusband, E. D.
Rickett, have sued \V. McGilllvray and his
wife, Mary A. McGlillvray, for the return of
$1400 cash ana a note for $800, that the plain
tiff* were induced to give for the furniture in
a lodging-house at 21 Van Nesi avenue. The
Kicketts assert that they were deirauded and
swindled by the McGillivrays in the trade,
and they wish to get their money back. Tuey
aver that the furniture was old and worn and
that it was not wortu more than $1000.
Acre* & Williams Insolvent.
The Acres <fc Williams Company, engaged in
printing and bookbinding, yesterday filed a
petition in insolvency. The debts of the cor
poration amount to $4173 82. For assets the
company presents a statement ot book ac

ber filed during the preceding four years.
The total number of opinions written by
the commissioners to December 31, 1896.
is 3229. They have besides examined 379
applicants for admission to practice as
attorneys-at-law, of which number 277
have been admitted and 101 rejecte I. One
application was rejected without examina
tion.
On December 31, 1595. there remained
241 causes under sunmUsion. On Decem
ber 31, 1896, there were 273. On the Ist of
February this number had been reduced
to 260, but by the audition of new cases â
no less than 86 since the Ist of January â
the total number unaer subm ssion stands
at 346, which the court has ahead of it to
wort upon.
These statistics do not include all the
work of the court â for instance, the ap
peals heard and dismissed would in a few
years number several hundred.
The Supreme Court is now very con
veniently and handsomely housed on the
seventh floor of the Parrott building. It
waa formerly located at Sacramento as a
fixture. It came here 1875, ueing located
on the northeast corner of Kearny and
Clay streets. By the new constitution the
number of the Justices was increased from
five to seven, and the court thereupon
moved to the northwest corner of Stock
ton and O'Farrell streetsâ los Stockton.
The commission was created in 1883, and
the court moved to 121 Post street After
ward it moved to the building at the cor
ner of McAllister and Larkln streets.
Every session of the Legislature as far
back as the memory of this generation
runs has seen a bill "to accommodate the
Supreme Court" struggle to become a Jaw.
The Supreme Court has finally accommo
dated itself by seeking the first really am
ple and modern quarters that it has ever
known.

THIS BABE'S CRIME

So Both Her Father and
Mother Wish to Be
Rid of Her.
Peter Lamond and Wife Charged
With Awful Acts of
Inhumanity.
The S(ci?ty for the Prevention cf
Cruelty to Children Finds a
Strange Case.
"Take her away; we don't want her.
And, what is more, if you don't we will
leave her on somebody's doorstep."
This was the strange and. inhuman re
mark that greeted tie ears of Secretary
Hoi brook of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children and a deputy
as they stood in the doorway of 214 Carl
street yesterday. ' \
The "her" referred to was a weakly
looking infant, scantily clad, lying on the
cold board floor, ana lie speaker was Mrs.
Hattie Lamond, a buxom English woman,
23 years old, who live- there with her hus
band, Peter Lamoiul, who is a Scotchman
by birth and a gardener by occupation.
A complaint was received several days
ago that the woman was ill-treating her
baby daughter, and it was thought proper
to investigate the charges. The com
plaintâan anonymous communication
stated that the baby was born October 16
last, and because sue was a daughter the
parents were trying to kill it by neglect.
Neighbors in the vicinity, among whom
was Mrs. Conneally, residing at 517 Fred
erick street, informed Secretary llolbrook
that the parents were in the habit of
handling the child roughly, giving it im
proper food and wine to drink and letting
it sleep at night on the cold, hard floor,
with insufficient covering.
One lÂ»dy asserted that on one occasion,
when the child bad been crying for an
hour, she went in to see what was the
matter. The parents were seated at the
table drinking wine and playing cards,
while the child lay on the floor. The
neighbor was told to mind her own busi
ness. . .- - ;-vi> v
Mrs. Lamond admitted to Secretary
Holbrook that she let the child sleep on
tbe floor in an adjoining room because the
Seas bothered her when she was in bed
with her unnatural parents. She admit
ted also that she wished to get rid of the
baby, and that her husband did, too, be
cause it was not a boy.
Then it was that she grew angry and
made the remark that beads this article.
Holbrook would have brought tbe child
away, but it looked too feeble to be moved.
Toe society will keep a watch on tbe
case, and it the parents renew their cru
elty will arrest both of them.

The men who are anxious to secure an
Eyeless Eden in the Sou' hern Seas are
deeply in earnest. The leaders expect to
land the men who are putting up their
money to pay the expenses in a "land
flowing with milk and honey."
As yet no one Knows just where the new
"land of promise" is located, but then
everybody connected with the enterprise
has faith, and they assert that in a few
months they will be wealthy men. The
brig Percy Edwards is now almost ready
forces, and before the first of next month
the entire party, comprising a hundred
souls, will be under way for the Southern
Seas. E. A. Coe will be the secretary of
the colony, and O. W. Sickels, an ex-ser
geant in the United States army, will be
commander-in-chief of the colonist army.
Coe is well known here from his connec
tion with the heir presumptive of the Bis
marck Group, while Sickels is an old sol
dier and a tighter from the word go.
Other officers of the company are: Cap
tain J. Petersen, who is rated as "master
marine"; J. R. Drake, who is classed as
"first mate," and A. Z. Snyder, treasurer.
L. J. Reinharrt is the president of the con

They expect to make a home in the
Southern Seas, and even if they do not

ihe company will lose a great amount.
The steamer Doric of the Occidental

Mrs. P. Isenbcrg Jr., General A. S. Hart wi- 11,
George R. Carter, A. P. Simpson, R. T. Lillls.
The Doric made a very smart trip in
some of the runs beating the record made
by the Pacific Mail Company's China.
The official re port of the voyage as fur
nished by tne master is as follows:
From China and Japan: Sailed from
Hongkong January 16" at 11 p. m. , and had
strong head winds and sea to Shanghai
(Woosung). Thence on 20ih tine to Na
gasaki on 'Jlst; thence on i."Jd to Kobe ad
verse tide; thence to Yokohama on 24th
moderate; thence oc 28ih, at 12:05 p. M..
moderate to strong northerly winds and
following sea. Crossed 180 th meridian in
latitude 30.56 north, arriving at Honolulu
February Gat 2:10 a. m. in 9 days and 55
minutes. Tnence on 7ih to port at 10:13
a. M. in 5 days 23 nours and 51 minutes.
Had moderate head wind and sea to 10th,
thence fine to port.
Record passages of the Occidental and
Oriental steamer Doric, voyage fifth, com
pleting her first year in the company's
service, outward and homeward: From
Honolulu to Yokohama, 3513 knots, 10
days 9 hours 6 minutes (record west con
sidering distance); Kobe to Nagasaki, 387
knots, 1 day 1 hour 26 minutes (ship's rec
ord); Shanghri to Hongkong. 818 knots,
2 days 2 hours 29 minutes (record time);
Shangliai to Nagasaki, 452 knots, 1 day 4
hours 42 minutes (Occidental and Oriental
Company's record; Kobe to Yokohama,
34G knots, 23 hours 5 minutes (Occidental
and Oriental record) ; Yokohama to Hono
lulu, 3400 knots, 9 days 9 hours 55 minutes
(trans-Pacific record), except China, and
only 2y, hours behind that; Honolulu to
San Francisco, 2085 knots, 5 days 23 hours
51 minutes (ship's record).
From the above it will be seen that the
Doric has more than held her own on her
maiden trip to the Orient in the Occi
dental and Oriental line.
When the British ship Centesima was
making port last month she struck on a
rock in the north channel and came near
to making breaking away from the tug.
Captain Freeman, who, as pilot, was in
charge of the vessel demanded an investi

Lieutenant James H. Sears, United

and determined the position of another

The steam schooner Crescent City ar
rived and sailed a.am yesterday. The
vessel was long overdue, and considerable
anxiety was teit on her account. When
off her port of destination the storm
caught her, and Captain Allen had to put
out to sea. Time and again the steamer
was swept by the waves, and everything
movabl; was washed overboard. Finally,
however, port was reached and the pas
sengers landed in safety. The Crescent
was eleven days overdue, but the delay
was entirely due to the weather.
People on the Mail dock would like to
know where David C. Craig is. The last
seen of him was when he was taking pass
age on the steamer Umatilla, for Victoria,
B. C. A little while previously he was
seen in the Safe Deposit building drawing
money from the bank.
Craig accused Superintendent Anderson
of taking coffee beans away from the
wharf without accounting for them. This
was in a letter to the office, and when the
superintendent heard of it he at once hnd

got out on bonds, and the last heard of

MAY COMMENCE A SUIT.
An Evaporated Cream Company
That Complains of the Board
of Health.
The Highland Peopla Contend That
Their Product Has Not Fece yed
Justice in Analysis
Some time ago, as a result of investiga
tion among some of the condensed milk,
evaporated cream and kindred industries
of tne City, various statistics purporting
to be the result of correct analysis of
their products were published in certain
newspapers.
Among the statistics bo published were
figures giving the alleged constituents of
Highland Evaporated Cream. The con
cern owning this particular article of
commerce has taken umbrage and em
phatically denies the correctness of thesu
figures. Moreover, they assert that the
Board of Health does not claim that the
analysis was complete at the time the
figures were published, and they threaten
suit against their traducers.
As a matter of fact it seems that the
special point upon which the manufac
turers of Highland Evaporated Cream
dwell is the abundance of "butter fat"
contained in their product. According to
the published statement their cream only
contained 575 per cent of butter fat,
wtiereas they contend that the completed
analysis shows a percentage of 9of the
same desirable constituent. Another anal
ysis gave at least 8.88 t>er cent.
In view of the importance of these con
densed milks as foods these facts would
appear to lend special dignity to the con
troversy and entitle the Highland people
to at least the justice of public statement.
A Bad Case of Cruelty.
Officers Ho.brook and McCurrle ol the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
arrested Andrew Weber, a butcher, ia the Bay
City market yesterday for sending out a sick
horse to fulfill orders. The animal had a gore
back and neck and was so ill that it was froth
ing at the mouth. It was found necessary to
send for an ambulance and take the horse to
Weber's stables. The society has been watch
iug (his case for some time and finally suc
ceeded in iis quest. So indignant was the
crowd that bad gathered wnen the arrest wr.s
made that it was feared violence would be
used on the prisoner, but he was hurried
away to trae City Prison. He was afterward
balled out.THE BOOKS GOT

â¢ The Burlingame handicap hurdle event
it one and a half miles over six obstacle-,
worth $900 to the winner, decided at
Emeryville track yesterday, developed one
of the greatest green junipers seen In this
part of the country for some time. Flash
light was the name of this particular
jumper and tue bookmakers now have his
address securely pasted in the crowns ot
their hats. The Buriingame furnished
quite a fair lield of timber-toppers, among
which were Montaivo, carrying 165 pounds
- arid ruling an equal favorite wirh J 0 C,
who' was delegated to carry 150 pounds.
The tip out on Flashlight had been on the
coals for a week or so and the books were
besieged wita coin, the green 'un always
being a favorite in the betting.
Mike Hennessy had the mount and
"the Irishman" handled the fast son of
Surinam to perfection. Passing the stand
the favorite took the lead, and stepping
ever the hurdles like a veteran, won as he
pleased from Arundel.
The usual Saturday crowd was in at
tendance and business in the ring was the
liveliest of tue week. Favorites fared well,
â¢capiuring five of the mx events decided.
A two-year-old by Kylo, named after
the popular bookmaKer, Barney Schreiber,
was tirst in the two-year-old event, leal
ine Irritator, a 20 to 1 shot, out by nearly
a length, 'lhe winner, coupled with his
stable companion, Michael, were held In
such cheap regard in the betting that the
ring laid 20 to 1 against the duo.
The mile run that was second on the
card proved an easy thing for Pat Dunne's
i^alvable, which started a 9 to 10 lavorite.
The sticky going was too much lor In
stallator, and Dunne's hor^e won easily
from Cuppy in I:4B}^.
The speedy til ly "Tea Rose, starting an
even-money choice, defeated David in the
closest finish of tue day in the six and a
ha:f furlong ran. Leading almost from
the start the sweet iittle mare stood a
drive at the end and gained the verdict by
a head. Fifty yards from tne wire David
hove in toward the rail, and this undoubt
ed I v cost him the race.
The McLaughlin selling stake, over a
mile, for all ages, drew out but a field of
lour.
J'amien was a 7 to 10 choice and in a
terrific finish, tliat almost terminated in
the judges' stand, so far did the favorite
carry Schiller ouc. Pat Dunne's long
strides caught the eye of the judges tirÂ«t
by a neck in 1:44. Salisbury 11, the un
certain son of Hacine, was a disgraceful
..third.
After betting on tne two-mile race had
progressed for jiome time Unity was
scratched and then Mone Fonce was
made a 1 to 4 chance. With no better
than Foremost and Fred Gardner to down
he won in a canter, with Foremost anead
of Gardner for second money.

STREETCAR FARES.
Important Meeting of Railroad Em
ployes to Hear Report* From the
Sacramento Oelegation.
A meeting attended by over 400 em
ployes of the different street railroads in
the City was held in the Mission-street
carhouse last night to hear the report of
the delegation that went to Sacramento
last Sunday to present the petition signed
by the employes against the passage of the
bill reducing the fares on the street rail
roads.
j W. C. Carpenter presided and W. C.
I Cootc acted as secretary. Chairman Car
pemer, Secretary Cook, P. J. Manning J
. C. Hardy, J. C. S iwtolle, W. H. Grand ana
j Frank Bell, who were all delegates, re
ported what had been accomplished and
that everything looked fuvorable :or the
defeat of i tie measure, which news aroused
i the j;reaiest enthusiasm.
A resolution was passed thanking the
| delegates for what" they had done, and
| they were instructed to return to Sacra
â  mento by this afternoon's train, as li was
I considered probable that final action
: would be taken on the measure either to
i morrow or Tuesday.
A resolution was also passed that the
'â  expenses of the delegation should be de
frayed by subscriptions from the em
ployes as soon as the matter was settled.
Secretary Cook said that the impression
bad been conveyed to the legislators that
: organized labor was in favor of the aieas
-1 ure; but he had the best authority for
: stating that no concerted action bad been
! taken by the Federated Trades in that
' direction.
OPERA TO COME.
Final Arrangements Have Been. Com
pleted for the French Company
to Open in .March.
According to a telegram received yester
day from J. Gottlob by Al Hay man & Co.
final arrangements have been completed
at Sew Orleans for bringing out the French
Opera Company to the California Theater.
The season will open sometime between
the 10th and 14th of March, and will last
for four weeks. It is expected that at
least twenty opera-* will be produced, two
or three of them for the first time in this
Cay.
An opera that will be lavishly mounted
Is Keyer's "Sigurd," which is almost un
known in this country, although selec
tions from it have sometimes been Bang at
local concerts. In New Orleans the com
pany has been in the habit ot giving light
works, such as "Miss llelyett" at the
matinee performances and works of the
regular grand opera repertoire in the
evening. .
An effort is being made to secure the
French Opera Company for St. Louis be
tore the end of its four weeks at the Cali
fornia, but the subscribers to tne guaran
tee fund here have refused to consent to
this arrangement, so the company will
probably proceed to St. Louis in April
after the close of its engagement at the
California.

DRY-GOODS MEN
TO PLAY BALL
Organization of Leading
Firms to Suppiy Clean
Amateur Contests.
Thirty Games, From Which
Charity Wil! Derive the
Net Proceeds
Only Bona-Fide Employes Can P ay
and Extra Precaution; Ttk?a
For Gent Â«manly Sport
Thirty games of pure, clean baseball,
devoid oi every trace of prolessionalism
and instilled with the enthusiastic ardor
of amateur pride, are promised the sport
loving people of this City. The promoters
of this series of games are six of the lead
ing dry-goods houses ol the City, and they
have gone about t lie project in a manner
never before attempted in this City,
though similar enterprises have been
highly successful in larger Eastern cities.
The plan upon which this league has
been organized is identical with that of
the National League, and it is backed
directly by the proprietors of the various
establishments. That they are entering
into the project seriously i-> evinced by
the fact that $1800 has already been ex
pended in equipping the clubs, and G. W.
Anderson, president ol the league, is
authority for the statement that Califor
nia has never seen any clubs, professional
or otherwise, umtormed as well as these
will be.
Financial gain id no part of the scheme
ol the organization, and the net proceeds
of the series will be devoted to charity.
Tne proceeds of the first game, wtiich will
take place on March 7, will be distributed
among such charities as the three morn
ing papers shall name. From a few of
the succeeding games the management
hopes to defrey the actual expenses of the
contests, and after that charity will again
be the recipient of the box returns.
The firms having teams comprising the
league are O'Connor Â«fc Moffatt, Newman
A: Livison, Kohlberjr, Strauss <t Frohman,
Hale Bros., J. J. O'Brien and the White
House.
Tne president of tlie league, G. W. An
derson of the White House, served in a
similar capacity in a league of commer
cial nines iv New YorK and is eminently
tinea to successfully direct such an organ
ization. His idea of the proper conduct
of the games is illustrated by bis request:
"Emphasize the fact that these games
will be strictly amateur contests by bona
ti'ie emuloyes of the houses represented.
Every player will be as gentlemanly upon
the diamond as in his place of DUsiness."
The full list oi officers is as follows: G.
W. Anderson, president; J. Lowentbal,
vice-president; G. O'Brien, secretary;'!.
P. Quintan, treasurer. The board oi con
trol consists of F. \V. Warren of O'Con
nor it Miftati; F, Owls of Kohlberi:,
Strauss <t Frohman; G. Adams of Ha'e
iJros.; G. O'Brien of J. J. O'Brien; G. W.
Anderson of ttie White House.
In order that no prolessional or other
outsider may under any pretence be runj;
in as the season progres-ses, each hor.-e
has been required to furnish a list of bona
tide employe?, from whom the teams mu>>t
be selected. A handsome trophy has
been hung up by the proprietors and the
various tennis will commence systematic
practice to-aay. The enthusiasm of the
players promises food ball.
Following is the schedule of games as
far as at present arranged:

A NURSE FOR NEEDY SICK
Many Charitable Societies Wish
to Unite in Employ
ing One.
Ccnferenca Held Wtdiesday and the
Idea Discussed as Feasible
and Economical
The San Francisco Conference of Chari
ties, in session Wednesday afternoon in
Golden Gate Hall, discussed the practica
bility of co-operation among tha various
benevolent organizations for the specific
purpose of employing a regular trained
nurse to visit and give simple practical
suggestions to the households of the most
urgent cases of sickness among the worthy
Dut inefficient poor of the City.
A committee consisting of Miss Bryce,
president of the Fruit and Flower Mis
sion; Mrs. Flint, secretary of the Asso
ciated Charities, and Mrs. Fonda of the
Mizpah Club was appointed to ascertain
the i'oit of a benevolently inclined nurse
and the names of the different societies in
tne conference that will contribute a pro
rata share of such monthly salary as may
be deemed proper and suitable for an in
teiested, conscientious woman nurse. All
communications and suggestions on the
subject may be addressed to the chairman
of tne committee, Miss Bryce, at 1524 Vai
lejo street.
Twenty of the twenty- rive societies con
stitutine the conference were repre
sented by delegates at the meeting. All
expressed tnemselves as favorable to the
project of employing a regular nurse and
all seemed impressed with the practica
bility and economy of the plan.
Tlie subject for discussion was the ad
visability of co-operation in all branches
o! charitable work undertaken by various
societies. Mr?. George H. Buckingham
of tlie Fruit and Fiower Mission opened
the discussion with a paper in which she
urged co-operation as a means of reaching
more cases of deserving poor and of
avoiding multiple attentions on the part
of several societies to some unwortny
case. She merit oned that the city of
1' iisdeiphUi employs district nurses to
visit the sick among the needy poor.
Comments and suggestions by a number
of the delegates followed. Some most
practical and appropriate points were
brought out by Miss Bryce, and it was
she who first advocated the employment
of a nurse.
Chairman G. G. Woo lward, a member
of the British Benevolent Society, an
nounced the appointment of an executive
committee of the conference with the fol
lowing member*: Mrs. E*berg of the
Emanu-El S;sternood, Mrs. Flint of the
Associated Charities, Mrs. Popert of the
German Lidies' Benevolent Society, Rev.
\V. I. Kip Jr. of the Good Samaritan Mis
sion and OÂ»good Putnam of the Asso
ciated Charities.
Tup secretary of the conference, J. C.
AstreUo, announced that societies having
boy applicants for aid should send them
to him at 24!) Second street, where efforts
would be made to provide for them.
At the conclusion of the meeting tea
and light reireshments were served to the
delegates by the ladies of the Fruit and
Flower Mission, under whose particular
auspices the session was heid.
The con:ercnce will meet again In about
six weeks at some place to be determined
upon later.
Mayor I'helan Turned in the Feel.
Colonel Sullivan, Mayor Phelan's private
secretary, yesterday turned in to the posses
sion and custody of the City Treasurer at the
new City Hall .f'24. fee 1 * foroutside lauds deeds
which had been signed by the Mayor. During
the term of Mr. smro's incumbency of the of
fice of Mayor $324 was collected for such
deeds, but no r ayinent was mad<- of such fees
to i he treasury. Mayor Phelan's act shows
tnat he construes the law to read that such
fees must legally be turned into the treasury,
and this view is sbarea by Auditor BroderlcK.
Colonel Sullivan said that be had been In
structed to place all fees collected in the
Mayor's office in the City treasury.
Three Inquentg.
A Coroner's jury decided yesterday that the
death of Dan'.i-l Fleming of 34 Golden Gate
avenue two days ago was due to an accident.
Fleming received his injuries In the Union
Iron Works, being struck from above by a
failing iron plate. There is an irithnntiou in
the verdict that the bolt holding had not been
carefully inspected.
Emma McQnoid, who took carbolic acid at
208 Shotwell street, was declared a suicide.
The case of William Ratcliffe, who was killed
by a fall from a halyard on the ship liiddekel,
was declared an accident.
State Prison Machinery.
Messrs. Kerr, Allen and Kuiman, a majority
of the legislative committee of the Manuiac
tuters* and Producers' Association, to whom
was submitted the question of introducing a
bill in the Legislature doing away with the
use of machinery in the State prigous after
December 31, 1807, met in the rooms of that
organization in the Mills building yesterday,
and a majority reported adversely. Mr. Kerr
will file- a minority report.
Offering a Bribe.
Frank Marty, the milkman who was In
dicted by the Grand Jury for offering a bribe
of $1000 to Supervisor Dodge to get his influ
ence in securing the contract for supplylug the

POLICE JUDGES
ON THE GRILL
Their Action in Pure Food
Cases Scored Without
Mercy.
A Council of Associated Indus
tries Committee Grows
Indignant
It Desires the Sale of Impure Fo d
Made a Fekny Instead of a
Misdemeanor.
Police Judges on toast, served hot, with
bottled indignation on the side. That
was the bill of fare at a meeting of the
pure food committee of the Council of As
sociated Industries, held in the Mills build*
injr yesterday. %
The session opened with a discussion of
the best methods of making dealers sup
ply their patrons with food chemically
pure and the reasons why the Jaws now
on the statute-books have so signally
failed of their intent. Chairman Isidor
Jacobs opened the discussion by laying
the Police Judges by the heels.
"Gentlemen," he asserted emphatically,
poundin? the table to ada greater force to
bis remarKs, "the cause of thÂ« whole
trouble lies with our Police Judges. They
are the man that deserve the cudgel in
this matter.
"Case after case is brought before them
and is turned away day after day in a
manner simply shameful. They are will
ing for your wives and babies to be slowly
poisoned day after day rather than treat
the violators of this most just law as they
properly deserve. We should request
these men to meet with us and explain
why they refuse to take cognisance of
these cases."
Tlien J. W. Kerr took a harder shot at
the offending magistrates. Uis voice
trembled witu indignation as he spoke.
"What!" he exclaimed. "Meet in con
sultation with men who admitâ or at
least some of whom do â that they are un
willing to execute their sworn duty for the
fear of losing votes ? Ifot I. I beg to be
excused. We could do nothing to influ
ence such persons anyway."
Other members took a hand in the pro
ceedings at some length. Methods to ob
viate the difficulty were freely discussed.
The idea that met with the most approval
was to have a bill passed making the sale
of impure food a ieiony instead of a mis
demeanor. Tnen, B. K. Rowley said, the
cases would properly come before the Su
perior Courts, and the presiding Judge
could select one of his associates to hear
all such cases.
P. J. Healy and Isidor Jacobs were ap
pointed a committee to confer with Gar
ret \V. McEnerney, the attorney for the
Board of Health, to see bow matters could
be expedited and the proper way to urge
the reform.
Among other things discussed was the
subject of adulterating catÂ»up with
salicylic acid. B. N. Rowley said he had
given the matter due consideration and
examination and had found that while
the acid was not poisonous it prevented
fermentation of food in the stomach, a
process vital in food digestion.
The recent agitation of the sale of im
pure food was asserted to have made a de
crease in the importation of canned
goods and jellies from the East to the
amount of $15,000 monthly.
Adjournment 'was taken after per
manent organization of the committee,
with the election of Isidor Jncobs as presi
dent, .1. W. Kerr as vice-president and
Oscar Lewis as secretary.
BRENNAN IS IN NO HURRY
Willing to Wait a Month for
His Three Felony
Trials.
Young Theresa Tarpey, the Victim,
Seeps in Her Grave, and Ha
U Out on Bail.
Nicholas Brennan, against whom three
felony charges are pending, complacently
smoked cigarettes in the corridor near
Judpe Wallace's court to-day, while
the lawyers were arranging for a further
postponement of the trial.
Unusual efforts have been put forth on
behalf of this young man, who, tnough
quite insigniticantin looks and bearing on
his face the marlci of early dissipation,
appears to have behind him in an unusual
degree that mysterious influence which is
called "the pull."
Brennan is accused of extorting money
from Theresa Tarpey, formerly a domestic
servant in this City, but who is now dead.
It is also alleged that he feloniously as
saulted her and subsequently forced her
into a disreputable house for the purpose
of compelling her to support him.
According to the facts elicited in the
preliminary charge and examination
Brennan harassed his victim, who was an
industrious girl Detween 16 and 17 years
of age. He peremptorily demanded
money and was willing to sacrifice her in
every way to gratify his cupidity. Fol
lowing it a copy of one of hia letters to
the girl, copied from the official records
of the case, and it indicates the style of
his dealings with his victim :
Saturday, Dec. 21, 1895.
Test: What do yon mean by not showing up
this afternoon as I asked you to? Do you
want to get hurt? Ihu mad â positively mad.
I've a strong inclination to knock the stuffing
out of you. If you didn't want to come you
could have sent word to that effect and we
could hÂ«ve called it all off. I want some
money and must have it, and you have got to
get it for me or it will be the worst for
you. By God, if you don't send it I will go
up where you are working and raise m
general. If you can't get ten get five and send
it back by the boy. I'm not running a bluff.
I've got to have it and you've got to get It. I
want you to come to Green and Hyde to-night
at 8 and no iooling. You've got me mad and
you better not fool me if you know what's
good for yourself. Be sure and send it b*ck by
the boy. Yours, Nick.
530 California street, room 11.
Wl;en that letter was read to Brennan
on the occasion of bis arraignment be ap
peared to enjoy it, and he set- med to think
there was something witty about it, for i c
came near lauphing though his face still
retained the pallor that always accompa
nies cigarette stains on the fingers.
All the charges against Brennan went
over a week. He is willing to wait n.
month no doubt as he is out on bail. But
his victim is in her grave.

-Jvyjt-^ ' NEW TO-DAY
TO THE SKEPTICS.
Dr. Sanden offers strong and convincing arguments
to the people who have formed different reasons for
doubting the curative powers of his famous Electric Belt.
See if you are one of them. Dr. Sanden loves a skeptic,
because most of them are his best friends to-day. Peo-
ple whom he has cured were once skeptics.
Does It Generate Electricity ?
Many doubt its Electric power, not understanding how so simple
an apparatus can make Electricity. It IS simple. An arrangement of
four layers of metal is formed into what is called a voltaic pile. There
are eighteen of these elements in Dr. Sanden's battery, arranged in a
chain, and each generates a strong electric force when excited by being
immersed in vinegar and water for one minute. This force is con-
ducted through each link of the chain to the end, from which it is con-
ducted to the body by electrodes, as shown in the picture above. Dr.
Sanden offers $5000 for one of his Belts which will not generate a force
of Electricity strong enough to be felt by the wearer as soon as charged
and applied to the body. The power of the battery is warranted to
last one year. Read Dr. Sanden's book.
Some Have Used Other Belts.
There are many other kinds of belts, termed Electric, and experi-
ence has proven that most of them are worthless, because they do not
generate Electricity. The cheap, shoddy strip of cloth, with a few
copper and zinc plates hidden inside, and sold at from $1 to $3, have a
substance something like mustard in the cloth. touching the skin, and
for the first few days this warms the skin and seems, to an ignorant
person, like an electric warmth; but in ten days the mustard gives out
and the gullible wearer is convinced . that it is worthless. Usually he
will then proceed to condemn Electric Belts, when, as a matter of fact,
he has not used an Electric Belt. The comparison is like that of a
child's tin watch beside a full jeweled and perfect movement one is
useful as a toy and the other has a substantial merit. The fakirs who
travel from town to town selling these cheap, worthless contrivances
take advantage of the limited ! knowledge of sufferers on this subject,
and make them believe they are getting a valuable article at a low
price, when in reality the money is thrown away.. No belt is electric
unless you can feel the electric current from it, and Dr. Sanden war-
rants his in this respect. ? Read Dr. Sanden's book about it.
Some Have Failed With Drugs
And have lost all faith in everything. Many unfortunates have spent
every cent they have earned for years in feeding the quacks who live
and grow fat off this class. Many have spent hundreds of dollars with
physicians of high^standing without attaining the results desired â these
are naturally skeptical, and are justified. To them Dr. Sanden has
only to say there are over 500 in this city who have taken to Dr. San-
den's Electric Belt as a drowning man would grasp at a straw â as
little faith in it, and they have been cured by it. See their names in
his book.
Some Doubt the Curative Power of
Electricity.
Many people who have not studied the subject cannot understand
how electricity can do what is claimed for it. All scientific men, how-
ever, agree that it has a wonderful curative effect. Professor Fowler,
the world-famous author, said "Electricity is the instrumentality of all
life." Its great power is in the fact that the nerves of everything that
lives â man and beastâ are electric wires, charged with electricity.
When the nerves are weak and any organic disease or vital weakness
results â disease resulting from poor action of any vital function â
the cause is a loss of the nerve power, electricity. When that power
is given to the nerves for hours at a time as it is from Dr. Sanden's
Electric Belt, the life springs fresh in the nerves, and is carried by
them to the weakened parts, and health bubbles forth in every element
of the body. Dr. Sanden's book, "Three Classes of Men," explains
this fully.
What Will Cure One Won't Cure Others,
So some people say, and it is true of drugs, because all drugs go to the
stomach, and the effect of the dose differs according to the condition of
the stomach receiving it. Some diseases can be reached by stomach-
dosing ; others cannot. Some people can swallow 20 grains of quinine
at once and feel no effect ; others are stupefied by 5 grains. Therefore,
drugs are powerless in some cases, because unnatural, not adapted to
the disease nor to the patient. Electricity is not a drug; it is a natural
element of the nerves;' it is apart of the body, and its application only
adds to the natural vital force until that force grows strong enough by
the steady infusion of the current to throw off disease and regain the
full vigor of the body. Dr. Sanden's famous book, "Three Classes of
Men," which is free upon application, explains the difference between
drugs and electricity.
Are You Convinced ?
The points which people most frequently offer as justification - for
their lack of faith in Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt are fully covered and
answered. There is no other reasonable argument against the use of
this famous appliance by people who are weak, pain-racked and ner-
vous. It cures cases which medicine cures and cures many which
medicine does not. It is the Mecca of the skeptic, the despondent and
hopeless sufferer. It is the fountain .of life to the weak man and
woman. Are you in need of it, or . of the help it is claimed to give
Have you lost any of your vital nerve forceâ your strength of manhood
or womanhood ? If so, call and see it, or if you cannot do that, send
for the book, "Three Classes of Men." It is full of interesting facts
for your study, and has letters from hundreds of grateful people, your
neighbors, who have been cured by Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt. It is
free, closely sealed, by mail. Call or address

CORBETT SELECTS
PUGILIST JEFFRIES
The Los Angeles Champion
Will Box With Jim
After His Fight.
If Successful Jeffries Will Go
East With the Carbett
Company.
Georje Green May Be Matched to
Fight Tracer cr Ryan in
Carson.
Jim Corbett is making preparations to
leave this City on Monday evening for
Reno, at which place iie will give an ex
hibition on Tuesday evenins. The report
which was circulated yesterday that 11
'"orDett appeared in a boxing contest in
Reno he would be arrested, unless he paid
a license of $1000, was ridiculed by thp
champion, who saya that there will be no
hitch in the arrangements that have been
made by hia odvance yent. The $1000
license refers only to finish contests;
tnerefore he foars no annoyance frora t he
authorities so far as boxing entertain
ment" are concerned.
Corbett was promptly on time yesterday
afternoon at the San Francisco Handball
Court, where he playe"d several games with
Nealon, Bonnet and other local stars iv
handballism. lit- thinks Jim Nealon a
wonaeruil player for a man of his age and
weight, and doe:, not hesitate to say that I
with a little practice Neaion could give â¢
him (Corbett) a close race in a match of I
best two out of three games. Nealon j
promised the champion t^at he won v j
meet him in the Corbett handball court,
Carson City, a week or so before the fijht. J
and tben'the people of the Sagebrush >tat;
will nave an opportunity of seeing who is
the better man at handball. Nealon in
sists, though, that Corbett mu&i carry
wight for age so long as he persists in sav
ing that Neaion is too old 10 go a long dis
tance.
Last evening Corbett had a long chat
with Jeffries the champion heavy-weight
pugilist of Los Angeles, who is matched
to fight Stelzner in a few weeks, and the
conversation ended very favorably 10 both
fighters. Jeffries agreed to leave this City
for Carson immediately after his fight and
Corbett will have him among his stable of
fistic gladiators. The champion is very
favorably impressed with Jeffries' appear
ance, and it is safe to state that it the Los
Angeles pugilist defeats Stelzner he will
he one oi Corbet star performer?, as
Jim intends to make an extensive tour
through this country and England during
the summer months.
Of course, ii Fitzsimmons should win
the championship Corbett will not go
t"uring, but tue native son is as positive
of whipping the Cornish man as be is of
entering tlie ring on March 17. Every
body is surprised at : he champion's im
proved appearance. Of course be will
never lose the sallow appearance which
some people think is an indication oi a
partly wrecked constitution.
Corbeit wore the same color when he
fought Choynski on the barge some years
him;, and many people were then of the
impression that he had jaundice or
bilious trouble of some kind. But Cor
bett'a eyes are Dri^ht now, and, to u.Â«e his
own word*, he never felt better in bis li.'c.
He will s[mr to-day at the Chutes, and
on Monaav he wil have his last game of
iian i ball in the San Francisco ball cmm.
Harry Corbett will run a special Pnil
nian to the scene of the oatiie, either a
week or so before the day of the f'lsbt or
on ihe day previous to the fight. All will
depend upon the attractions which Stuart
Will arrange.
It is Â«aid that Georee Green will be
matched to li^hi either Tommy Ryan or
Tom Tracey.
Green bad a great ad vantage over Tracey
in weijrht the last time they fought in tbiÂ«
City, and there are many goo.l judge? of
pugilism who are of the opinion that Tra
Â«y ran Green if the pugilists enter
the ring at 145 pounds. Green Weighed
JSO pounds when he defeated Trace; by
getting the decision at the end of the tenth
round.
Sportine men will be surprised lo learn
that oid Professor Farlevhas cone tiled to
â ell his old homestead near the Industrial
School, at wbicb piace many a rig. l -tÂ«Â»r put
on the finishing touches. Fariey will
retire to private life for tite balance of bis
days.
SIXTEEN FORTY THE FARE
That Is What It Will Cost to
Go and Come From
Carson.
Bat the Pullman Rate Is $2 a Day
Extraâ One Fare and a Third
for Intermediate Points.
V - â  _________
The rate from San Francisco to Carson
has been definitely fixed by the Southern
Pacific Company at |16 40, as forecast by
The Call yesterday. It is subdividedâ
$13 40 between Ban Francisco and Reno
and $3 between the latter place and Car
eon.
This, as Mr. Stabbs explained yester
day, Is a little less than a fare and a tenth.
He said the company was not advised
yet as to the fare east of Ogden, but
thought there was no doubt the $30 rate to
the Missouri River would prevail. Of the
$35 rate between Ogden and Carson he
said it was $32 so far as his road was con
cerned, for that was what it would get out
of it. 'ii^jil
As to the rate for intermediate points,
or the rate for points east of San
Francisco, as, for instance, Sacramento
nnd other way places to Carbon, it will be
a fare and a third. This has been ar
ranged as definitely as the $16 40 round
trip rate from here.
For points south, including such places
as Los Angeles, Pasadena and San Diego,
the rate will be a fare and a fifth.
There is much speculation as to how
many wil! go from California to see tne
battle. The number In variously esti
mated At from 1000 and 1500 upward, Â«ome
hazarding tha opinion that it will be
tnousands-
About the Pullmans not being able to
pet over the road from Reno to Carson
there was a smile at the Southern Pacific
office. <:-
"You can depend uron it that the car?
will get through. That's what we are
here for. Pullmans have gone through
hitherto, and we know no reason why
they cannot now. he heavy engines are
a more difficult problem. Some of the
bridges may appear a little light, or the
rails in some places, or the grades steep.
.We will remedy all these things, of course,
and get the people through.
"The Pullmans ore not lone but we
can make the turns. That wil!*be accom
plished all right enough." . .-" .
'â¢ Reynold*' Csottmpt of Court. .
Junes Reynolds, an eld man who intuited
jurors lor declaring his son Thomas guilty of
burglary, was adjudged guilty of contempt of
i-oiiri by Judre Cools yesterday. Inasmuch as
the prisoner had served tweuty-four hour* and
had rppp?ited of Im error, his Honor imposed
a nuraiuat fine of $1.
LAST OP "LITTLE PETE."
His liody Was Shipped for China Ttl-
lei-dar oh the City of Peking.
A part of tne cargoof thesteamship City
of Pelting, whicb put to sea yesterday for
Yokohama and Hongkong, consisted of
the uo.iy of Little Fete. His widow and a
few friends were at the wharf to watch the
shipment o! ttie remains. No demonstra
tion was made. The widow wiil remain in
this City nun. her husband's estate is set
tled.
WINE FOE SGIENOE ONLY.
Rare Vintage* That Will Never Slake a.
Ron Vivant's Thirst.
In England there is a cellar full of
wines of the choicest vintages, which bid
fair to spoil for temperance sake. Years
ago, by the. will of Sir Walter Trevelyn
of Northumberland, England. that
knight's famous wine cellar became the
property of Sir Benjamin Richardson
the head of the Temperance Hospital in
London. . Bin the will enjoined Sir Ben
jamin Irorn using the wine for other than
"scientific" purpose?." Convinced that
none of 'lie wine in all â¢t. c sixty dozen
famous vintages in the cellar could be
used for the onrf-ose specified, Sir Ben
iaruin dm not draw the cork of a|;ingie
b.nile.
At I;!* death recently his widow became
the possessor of Hie valuable cellar, but
she, too, is forbidden to use it except in
the interest oi science. Sue cannot, un
der the will, sell the now famous wines,
even to donate the proceed^ to the cause
cf temperance. To store the many bot
tles year alter year is expensive, and yet
there seems to be but one other courseâ to
destroy. â I'ntsburg Dispatch.

: on this coast.
In the afternoon a meeting will be held
I that will be both original and unique, the
I like of which lias never before been seen
lin this City. This will he the auction of
: 150 children. In the evening a grand so

a number of phonographic pieces md a
display of social sidelights typical of the
work Deing done and 10 he done by the
army in this vicinity will form the pro

One of the most important branches of
this new Salvation Army Institute will be

which will be used as follows: One for con
sultation, one for dispensary, and anoth'T
lor surgery. Oiher branches are being
formulated by Major Wincheli, which, !
owing to the lack of time, have not been
brought to a head, but in a short time will
be completed.
In audition to the Workingmen's Insti

When they met, the invalid said: "Gen
eral Grant, I wish, to give you' a noble
horse, who has no superior on the conti
nent, as a testimony of my admiration for
your character and past services to our
country. There is a condition attached to
to the gift; that you will always treat
him kindly." Grant accepted the magni
ficent bay, of course faithfully keeping
his promise and named him Cincinnati.
He was a son of Lexington, with a single
exception the fastest four-mile thorough
bred that ever ran on an American course.
! The general was offered $10,000 for the
horse, as he bad a record 01 speed almost
equal to that of hiÂ« famous half-brother,
Kentucky. Cincinnati was a superb and
spirited stesd of great endurance, Grant
riding him almost constantly during the
Wilderness campaign, and passing from
end to end of our long lines. The noble
horse was retired soon after the close of
the war, enjoying "an old age of dignified
leisure" on a Maryland estate, where his
mastt-r frequently saw him, and where be
died and received honorable burial in Sep

Committee Appointed to Secure Head
quarters Where Previsions
May Be Stored.
The. members of thÂ« committee for the
relief of the unemployed, together with
some fifty or sixty of those who were
present at Friday afternoon's mass-meet
â¢i'ng, met in the small hall, 115 Turk street,
yesterday morning for tba purpose of
further perfecting arrangements for the
: â  immediate relief of the destitute. The
pentiment ol the meeting was unani
mously in favor of an active canvass for
donations in the shape of provisions, tem
porary lodging or money, and a second
'committee was also appointed to secure
Buitable headquarters where provisions
.may "bÂ« conveniently stored and from
f'thkh.ihey can be distributed on applica
tion. The men present at yesterday's
meeting g^nerou ? ly agreed to subordinate
the question of their own necessity to the
more pressing needs of distressed women
and children. It was pointed out ti.at
â¢ the more or less able-bodied among the
.â¢unemployed men could wait a few days
until the Major and Board of Supervisors
could consider some sort of action in re
sponse to the representation of the dele
. gation which will wait upon them to
; morrow afternoon.
Chairman Letfingwell presided at yes
terday's meeting and discouraged all ora
Â° torical oui bursts. "Tuis committee," he
said,, "has plenty Oi work to do, and all
speeches are out of order. â  But practical
. suggestions will be gratefully accepted."
An exception, however, was made in
favor of J. Andrews, who referred to the
. existing situation as in the highest de
ig.ree serious. He said that he was strongly
opposed to the doctrine of physical force
or bomb-throwing, but he would advocate
â¢ â¢ action calculated to compel the authori
. ties to afford some measure of relief.
J. A. Rogers again presented his scheme
for- a combination of the present unem
ployed, with the object of securing con
. tracts for grading work on railways and
streets, suggesting that Mayor Phelan
might be induced to act as treasurer until
Euch time as the contracts were com
pleted.
: .Chairman LefSngweli favored the con
sideration of present necessity rather
"â¢ than speculation as to the future. The
committee, he thousht, should get oat
â¢' and rustle on behalf of the women and
â¢" children who were in immediate need.
He criticized the manner in which the
emergency fund was handled at the City
" HalL
An old man named Volney here offered
A a suggestion to the effect that a regular
I place should be found in which to store
'.food, and that the destitute should be no
tified of the fact through the newspapers.
A. Fobe added that subscriptions to
'hat end should bo solicited from the City
Hall officials in the first place. The un
employed, he contended, would do well
to handle all such donations themselves
â¢ "in future.
The following were appointed to act as
the committee on headquarters: John
Richter, A. Fobe and I. W. Beardsley.
The meeting then adjourned until 1
. . o'c'.ock to-morrow afternoon.
S. A. Leffinjjwell, chairman of the or
. j-anization, has addressed the following
letter to The Call for publication :.;V:
San- Francisco, Cal., February 13, 1897.
Editor. Callâ lieae Sir: I desire to express
â  thanks to the press of this City lor the fairness
â  with which they nave treated the efforts of
.. the unemployed men and women of San
Francisco to secure some measure of relief in
â¢.h!r dire distress without violation of the
law. I have been requested, to make a state
ment of the present situation and to give an
outline of what we hope to accomplish.
As to the present situation, I believe any
fair-minded person will readily agree that
there is great destitution in this City at this
time. J The relief bureaus know of many cases,
but there are many others unknown to them,
beer.use some people entertain a sort of pride,
â¢ which stands in the way of an open confes
sion. I estimate that there are to-day at least
30,000 souls in this City who are in a state of
actual starvation.
As to what we hope to accomplish. We
don't know what can be done. We know there
â¢â re many things which the unemployed may
â¢be put to do, ana we know also that there are
t-ome funds in the City treasury, but we do
not know whether these funds could be used
for that turpose. We can do nothing of our
selves and have, therefore, no proposition to
advance. We originally Intended to move
upon Sacramento, but we find many of our
wembera are men of family and while they
.. Jt* of no practical use to their families they
reluctant to abandon their wives and
. children to the tender mercies of the cold
world.
We hold that In view ot the fact that in the
. event of this country being Involved In war
by an enemy.we would be compelled to defend
it. He in turn have a joint claim upon the
country we must defend ior relief in our day
of miafortune. We believe we have a right to
eat somewhere/inasmuch as we have done our
part in the world of production and even now
stand ready to continue doing it. As mdi.
. viduals we have been trying to find a place.
We cannot find it and have given up the
attempt. We simply ask that the community
assist us in finding a place where we may
enjoy the right to cat.
There are many destitute women ana Inno
cent children In sore distress to-day, and we
call upon them to acquaint us with their
whereabouts that we may share with them
whatever assistance our committees receive.
Moreover we guarantee an honest administra
tion of such charity as may fall into our hands.
It la simply a question of whether this com
munity would prefer that its destitute people
should commit a violation of the Jaw in order
that they may live, or whether the citizens
will contribute to the immediate needs of the
starving in their midst. Respectfully yours,
a A. Lkffinowkll,
Chairman of the Unemployed.

OVEE AN AFPOINTMENT.
Controversy Coining to a Head Between
Teachers and > chool Directors.
A controversy has been put on foot by
reason of the allegation by Principal
Eiisha Brooks and teachers of the Girls'
Hiph School that the appointment of Mrs.
Irene Reeves to be a teacher in tbat insti
tution was superfluous. President Bar
rington and Director Waller of the Board
of Directors said yesterday that the direc
tors acted strictly under the regulations of
the department, which limits the Mze ot a
clasa to forty pupils in the junior grades
in the Inch school.
According to Principal Brooks' last re
port there are 253 pupils in the junior
grades, and. therefore, this calls for six
teachers. Moreover, Mr. Brooks requested
at the end of last year that another teacher
should be appointed to the Girls' High
School. Th-refore, said the directors, t c
trouble is probably that the Girls' Hign
School teachers are not opposed to another
teather, but only to one who was not their
choice.
HISTORY OP ASPHALT.
Professor Bienfeld Lectures Vpon the
Zoology of Paving Material
"The Origin and History of Asphalt"
was discussed by Bernard B;enfeld, Ph.B.,
before the members of the Mechanics' In
stitute last evening. The speaker traced
the various transmutations of t c mate
rial from "that dim and distant border
land where life has just begun," where it
served as the protecting shells of micro
scopic organism, until it is dug from tbe
mountains of California or the islanas of
tbe sea to be used as paving for populous
cities.
The lecture was illustrated by lantern
slides showing the various forms of the
organisms which it protects in its primary
sate and a number of street scenes evi
dencing the practical use to which the
material is now put.

THE RICHEST AMERICAN COUPLE ARRIVE HERE.
Henry Payne Whitney, son of W. C. Whitney, ex-Secretary of the Navy, and Mrs. Whitney (nee Vanderbilt), daughter
of Cornelius Vanderbilt, the man with more millions than anybody else in the country, arrived here yesterday on the steamer
Doric. They have been touring the Orient.
Mr. Whitney and Miss Vanderbilt were married at Newport August 25 last. The wedding excited more attention than
any other in recent years, except that of Miss Gould and Count Castellane. The contracting persons from a political and
social standpoint are among the eminent of the Nation. Then when it comes to money there are almost no comparisons to be
made with anything that is past.
The young bridÂ« will, it is said, become heiress to no less than 150,000.000. and her husband, Mr. Whitney, to about
$40, 000,000.
Mr. Whitney graduated at YaJe and afterward took a law course at Columbia College. He is to hare charge of the law
department of the great interests represented by the Standard Oil trust. His pleasures, as thus far shown, consist of shooting
in the h.ccky Mountaine, in society and in yachting.
Mrs. Whitney as Miss Vanderbilt spent almost the whole of her income in charities of some Jcind in thia country She
has assisted many institutions for the benefit of women and children and has given generously to aid the suffering of people of
all degrees. The fortune of the couple is ihe largest ever known in America.
They came to Vancouver intending to go at once to the Orient, but the black plague for a time detained them. Then
they went to the islands and China, penetrating the latter country somewhat in the interior, and then visited Japan. They

"About 500 people will come from lowa
to attend the m-eting here," said Mr. Kin
zer. "There may ba more, but we are
hguring on that many anyway. Two
years ago, when the National meeting
was held at Boston, between 900 and 1000
people from lowa attended. There has
for a long time been a desire on the part
of our people to come here. When the

they should hold oli and come to San

' 'Besides this some of tbe people of lowa
who expected to come here this winter
have postponed their coming till July. 1
know a dozen of such people, and out of
the dozen only three are coming now.
The remainder will take advantage of the
reduction in rates.
"The fare from the Missouri River and
return is $46, and for points east of there
to the Mississippi it is $46, and one fare
added. The rate from Chicago, as is no
doubt known, is $31. These rates are in
ducing many people to come her*. They
want to see California, of whose great at

'â¢We want to get all our p ople located

a big crowd here we thought it was best to
come on and make arrangements in time."
The (.'entlemen will be here for several

MUST LAST HVE YEARS,
Merchant*' Association Make a Request
Concerning Geary- street Paving;.
The following communication was sent
to the Board of Supervisors yesterday by
the 'Merchants' Association concerning
the paving of Geary street:
At a meeting of the board of directors of the
Merchants Association, held on Friday even
ings the 12th inst., it was resolved to ask that
the coutrnc.or for the work of repaying Geary
street/ irom Kearny to Powell, be requited to
keep his work in good condition and repair
without extra cost for a period of not less than
five year*. He should give bonds with some
surety company as bona in the full amount of
the contract price. â  . Â«-v..
Under a decision of the Supreme Court it
was aecided (98 Cal., 10) that on public con
tracts a guarantee clause was not valid, as it
conflicted with section 13 of the general street
law. â  .
But this work is to be done on an accepted
street, and, an the provision* of section 13 do
not apply to accepted streets in need of repair,
it is beieved that you can safely place the
euarantee clause in the contract and notify
the bidders in the o*ll ior bids that such guar
antee will be exacted.

Sensational Sequel of the Deeiin^ of
a Child fcr Ten Dollarsâ Legal
Proceedings to Follow.
"WOODLAND. Cal.. Feb. 13.â The people
of Dnon were thrown into a wild state of
excitement Friday over the sensational
kidnaping of the four-year-old child of
Mrs. A. P. Dartney, the wife of a black
smith of that place.
Mrs. Dartney was formerly known as
Sallie Maguire and lived in San Francisco,
where her baby girl was born. A Mrs.
Holstrom became infatuated with the
sweet little child and made 8 proposition
to the mother to adopt it, ana it was un-
derstood that If Mrs. Holstrom would
give the mother $10. or rather the attend
ing physician, the former lady should
have undisputed possession of the child.
A written contract was drawn ap to that
effect, but Mrs. Holstrom neglected to
take out the formal letters of guardian
ship or adoption.
About the first of February of this year
Saliie Maguire, now Mrs. Dartney, went
to Mr?. Holstrom in Sin Francisco and
demanded possession of the child. Mrs.
Holstrom refus d to give up the little
girl, whereupon the mother appliel to
Secretary Kane of the Society for the Pre
vention of Vice, and in company with this
official went to the Holstrom home and
forcibly took the child away from Its
foster-mother. Mrs. Holstrom appealed
to the courts (or the recovery of the child,
and an order was made directing Secre
tary Kane to produce her in court.
In the meantime Airs. Dartney had
taken the child to Dixon, ana when Officer
Kane went in search of her in order to
obey the order of the court, he was unable
to timl the little girl, and he so reported
to Judge Trouit. A picture of the child
appeared in The Call of February 4, ana
it was noted b/ peoi>le in Diion that the
child whom Mrs. Dartney had in her pos
session bore a striking resemblance to the
photograph.
Mrs. Holstrom was apprised of this fact
and on Friday morning's train there ar
rived in Dixon a couple of det ctives and
Mr. Holstrom, the husband of the woman
who bad the baby torn from her arms.
Mr. Holstrom disguised himself as a
tramp and appeared at the Dartney home.
He was met at the door by Mrs. D^rtney,
whom he asked for something to eat. The
child was playing in one of the rooms
and while the mother went into the
kitchen to procure the supposed tramp
some food, he entered the room, grabbed
the child and ran up the street.
The woman at once gaye the alarm, and
in a abort while the streets were thronged
with people. The officer overtook the
kidnaper, but he would not give up the
child. The officials would not arrest him
on account of the order of court demand
ing the chiid.
Mr. Holstrom and the detectives boarded
a south-bound freight train for San Fran
cisco with the child, and Mrs. Dartney
followed on the overland train.
A legal contest for the possession of the
child will now follow.

of humanity, the unpardonable sin. It blights all

weakens the brain. Its train of ills and evils tears
down the strongest constitution and completely
wrecks the mental and physical man. Thousands
of young and middle-aged men through this
scourge of humanity have found homes in insane
asylums or filled suicide's graves. It unfits the
sufferer for study, business and the social or
married relations of life. It causes tired feelings,
dizziness, paralysis, softening of the brain, weak
and shrunken organs, lost manhood, despon-
dency, fear of impending danger, bashfulness,
pimples, loss of memory and a wandering mind.
Among the married it creates discontent, disap-

broken up more homes, caused more desertions
and separations than all other evils combined. If

DEAR SIR: -V
Yes, It's a fact (because of inevitable private
reasons'). I'm compelled^o offer my land agency
business for srle, and In order to enVct a quici
deal am witling 10 make a g.eat sacrifice and give
some one a gr'atbirgaln and finest business on
Pacific Coast for almost nothing. You may think
it strange (and so it is) that after 16 years of valu-
able experience, in the business, having s.ent
thousands of dollars in advertising and traveled
the Stale over with horse and ou^gy Inspecting
and appraising nearly every raucn on the Pacific
Coast, and now having secured the agency ">f
about 3000 choice roperties offered for sale and
exchange, earned $30,000 commissions la last five
years, still I've rea ly decided to sell everything
just as it stands, Including my enormous list of ac-
curate y written descriptions, together with als co.i-
tracts, complete set of blanks, special}- designed
and printed set of books, diagrams, rraps, hun-
dreds of r holographs, thousands of letters, Ist of
prospective purchasers, all furniture, etc.,
in fact, the most complete and best system-
atized land agency EH AMERICA, Occupying
three elettan'Jy fur.ished f.ont rooms, secured by
long lease a: reasonable r. nt. Everything Is in
prfect condition and though having cost thou-
sands of dollar* and years of hard work all goes
lor a few hundred dollars, which suou.d easily be
made back from deals now in progress wlthiu one
mouth. In conclusion I win say that as the busi-
ness Is simple to conduct and prospects were never
better any wideawake business man can take my
place and make much more in the future than I
have In the past. Pleasant, profitable and genteel
with unlimited possibilities. Thorough investiga-
tion invited by- yours truly, .

THE REALIZATIONS
OF THE DREAMS OF AGES.
THE FUTURE UNVEILED
. FOR THOSE WHO CARE TO SEE.
The Parisian prophetess has arrived and is now
in the city: that, great exponent of the occult art,
that renowned ai d famous mediumâ Miss Van de
Vereâ whose clairvoyant vision penetrates all the
subtle mysteries of Life and Death, from which
the commou mind is veiled.
Query: Why is it that so many Dersonsâ men
and women gified In many waysâ struggle on
from day to any, urged on by love or hale, or am-
bition, yet n >ver succeed, although their exertions
are almost superhuman and tneir fortitude is
more than sublime as they drag their weary limbs
through years of trial, while their poor, tired eves
gaze yearning y for that Mecca of 11 apj iuess they
have never found.
But there is hope for ell the unsuccessful ones.'
Consult Miss Van de Vere an I she will tell you
what he trouble is and how to r-medy It. No
mailer whether you are rich or poor, hign or low,
she desires to ho.d out the hand of friends ip and
Rood i her to all who art* msrtrrsupon the rack of
fate.
Miss Van de Vere sends greeting to the people
of San Francisco and vicinity and Invites all those
who are unfortunate or in troub'e to come to her
and have the ciuud removed. Advice given on
business Investments, speculation, love, courtship,
marriage Mnd divorce; in fact, upon everv matter
that would concern vour future success. All com-
munications .-acredly confidential. Letters con-
taining stamps answered.

The Rubber Industry.
People familiar with the condition!
under which the world is supplied with
ruDber say there is reason to fear that tbe
destruction of the trees producing this
precious substance is proceeding at a rate
which may have disastrous consequences
in the near future. That the price of the
raw gum has not advanced more rapidly
than it has in the last year is due, they
say, not to an intelligent cultivation and
multiplication of tbe rubber trees, but to
the complete lack of fores ght that charac-
terizes the inhabitants of the South
American forests. The sudden vogue of
bicycles and tbe universal use of elec-
tricity have vastly increased the demaud
for rubber, and M far the demand has been
met without trouble, but the. present chief
source of supply is limited, and unless
new ones are found or new methods are
adopted, several great industries may
soon be seriously embarrassed. Rubber
is 11 substance as nearly unique and as
difficult to replace as is known to men.
Fortunately, however, i: is produced by
more than one plant, and the utilization
of new species has ai ready beguu. NorA
of them compares with iwo found in tho
valley of the; Amazon, but commercially
important quantities of the gum coma
from each 01 a dozen plants growing in
almost as many tropical lanas. The Lan-
dopbilia, a climbing vine o! Central Atrica,
seems to be most likely of them all to take
the place of the ! Brazilian trees if * bt
latter are doomed to exunclion.â NÂ«

ON DR. McLEAN
Little Hope for Oakland
Harbor for the Next
Two Years.
A Statement- Drawn Up at
. Washington That Caused
Great Surprise.
The Doctor's Colleagues at This En J I
Were Not Aware of His New
Move. :
Oaklaj.*.-* Office San Frascisco Call,*
908 Broadway, Feb. 13. )
The Board of Trade and Merchants' Ex
change directors were considerably sur
prised to-day to learn that all appropria
tions for the improvement of Oakland
harbor had been cut out of the Senate bill
on account of a large error.- The last in
formation received on this point was to
the effect that Colonel Sutler had been
\ ordered to proceed with ide work, and it
i was expected that as soon as specifications
â¢ were drawn up contracts would be let.
Instead, however, it now appears that
additional information has been placed
. before the House committee ,wbic . has
upset all calculation*. A. few months ago
an agreement was reached between the
Oakland and Alaineda authorities as 10
the recommendations that should be made
'to the War Department. According to
this agreement the Oakland end of the
harbor was to be deepened first, after
which the tidal canal was to be cut
through.
Dr. McLean, Alamcda's Health Officer,
wiTit to Wushington supposedly for the
purpose of furthering the work, but wbeu
the fact became known tuat the appropria
tions, had oeen cut out of the bill inquiry
was at once made for the cause. It was
found in a statement prepared by Dr. Mc-
Lean after he had gut to Washington, and
of which nobody at this end knew any
thing.
The statement prepared by Dr. McLean
is h.eaded "A Dehcit and the Cause of the
Same in the Appropriation for the Com
pletion of Oakland Harbor, Under the
Continuous Contract fey-tern at t..e Last
Session, Which Should Now Be Corrected."
No one in Oakland was aware of any de
ficit, and they are greaily surprised to
Jearn that such a state of affairs had been
brought to the attention of the committ. c
by Dr. -McLean, as it was understood that
he was working actively to have work on
the harbor commenced as boou a 3 possi
ble.
â¢ It appears from his statement that, find
ing it useless to advocate the completion
of the tidal canal before the improving of
the Oakland end of the harbor, he looked
about for a new point of attack and found
it a-s he supposed. But those who are
familiar with all the facts assert that Dr.
McLean's latest move is without merit.
There is a general feeling tnac instead of
.picking Haws in the manner of th? appro-*
pnation, Dr. McLean should have used
all his energy to secure the use of the
money already appropriated, after which I
another effort could have been made at
another session of .Congress to have se- i
cured the alleged deficit. It now Jocks as
if nothing would be done on the harbor
for the next two years.
The section of Dr. McLean's statement ;
Which fully explains the peculiar dis- !
patches published to-day is as follows:
"Colonel G. H. Mendel], corps of en- !
gineers, lately in charge of OaKian.l Har- i
bor, in his annual retort for the year end- i
ing June, 1895, states the amount rtQuired
for the completion of the harbor to be
$741,000. This was the official statement I
upon whicn Congress.- acted in the river

Road, Who Resigned Rather Than Fight F. M. Smith,

and harbor bill of June, 1896, when it
made an appropriation of $20,000 for contin
uing the improvements, with the i roviso
that contracts may be entered into by the
Secretary of War for such material and
work as may be necessary to complete
the improvement, to be paid for as appro
priations may from time to time be made
by law, not to exceed in the aggregate
1666.000. b
"An error was made after the river and
harbor bill passed the Senate Committee
on Commerce, by which the Commi tee
on Conference of both houses reduced the
Senate's appropriation from $75,000 to
$20,000 and failed to add the difference
between these amounts, $55,000, to the
J^66,000, whfch the bill authorized for con
trac:s by the Secretary of War. In this
way this $ti66,000 fell short by $55,000 "f
the $741,000 which Colonel Mendell in 1895
reported as the estimated amount neces
sary f or t ne completion of Oakland Har
bor."
Under these circumstances the whole of
the appropriation was cut out of the bill
Â»t Washington and everybody interested
in the harbor heartily "wishes that Dr.
McLean had staved at home and looked
â f'er the health of the Encinal ci'y in
stead of preparing statements at Wash
jngton which ended so disastrously for
m-is community.
VALUE OF A MAU.
A Jury Decide* John Johnson to Be
Worth *4000
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 13.â The exact
value of a man was decided this afternoon
by a jury in Judge Hall's \ court. - John
Johnson some months ago sued the Hay
wards electric road for $10,000 for injuries
received while traveling on its cars. In
biÂ« complaint it was stated that he was
seven-eighths disabled, and a demurrer
was interposed stating that the language
was too ambiguous.
In arguing the demurrer Attorney M. C.
Chapman of counsel for the plaintiff de
nied that the language was ambiguous and
stated that when It got to the jury they
would decid the val'ie of the injured por
tion of the man. Tnis morninir the case
was given to the jury, and after being out
a few hours they returned with a verdict
of $3500. which, in accordance with the
allegations of the complaint, fixes the
value of the man at $4000.

The difficulties winch arose between
Frank J. Woodward, receiver of the High
land Park and Fruitvale electric road and
the Realty Syndicate Company, of which
I. M. Smith is president, have not re
sulted in the interesting proceedings that
were expected. When the several charges
against Woodward were filed about a week
a;jo, with a request that he be removed
from the position of receiver, because of
t administration In office, Woodward
I declared he would tight the case to the
bitter end, and a lively legal battle was
I expected.
This mornine, after a short consultation
in chambers. Frank Woodward handed in

he assisted the syndicate to acquire.
Woodward also specifically denies th*
charge that he allowea the rolling-stock of
the road to run down, or that, he settled
charges against the road for. lens than
their face value. He also stated that a re
ceiver is necessan- and that his own ser
vices were worth $150 a month.
There was no argument in court. As

and the attorneys went into the chambers
and when they returned Woodward hand

written of the history of the Order of the
Black Cross.
Judge Ogden recently decided that the
whita castle of Peiehof is the property of
the Count's widow, Elizabeth Poulson.
For over three years the battle over the
Poulson property has been waged. The
Countess claimed ownership by virtue of
a deed of Rift that her husband afterward
destroyed. She was opposed by the Pub
lic Administrator and some relatives of
the Count, but thpir claims were all passed
over by Judge O'den and his decreu in
favor of the widow has just been recorriei.
For several months no new prophecies

The old man who lived in the tank
bouse ana refused to be put out because
he said the Count appeared to him in a
vision and told him to stay there has
also gone. Miss Lizzie Carter, who cir
culated all manner of stoii's about the
widow, and for whose arrest a warrant
was issued a long while a^o, was never
heard of after she arrived at Denver,
where she was taken t-ick, nor did she
come on to California to try to establish
her charges.
All the prominent characters in the
weird drama that was enacted a few years
a?o have dropped out ot sieht, evidently
having lost faith in their Messiah.
Up to about a year ago many of his fol
lowers firmly believed that Count Poui
son would return to earth ana wou d
again inhabit his castle and preside over
tne Order of the Black Cro-s. This was
the doctrine preached by Primate Smith,
tut as each successive date on wnich the
Count was to appear passed by and he
came not their faith gradually dwindled
away, and now no members of the order
can be found.
Some months ago Mrs. Poulson, who
had been subjected to all kinds of incon
veniences and annoyances by the many
cranKs wno looked upon her as their per
sonal er.emy and who wished to bold
Peterhof sacred to ihe memory of tneir
founder, married a well-known singer of
San Francisco, and io now living in that
City.
She never sympathized with the Count's
extraordinary ideas of modern spiritual
ism, and was applying for a divorce when
the Count died. All manner of sansa
tional stories about poisoning and similar
charges were circulated by me little band
of fanatics who worshiped under tne
Count, but they were all proved to De ab
solutely devoid of foundÂ»tion, and now
they and their authors are buried in ob
livion, and the history of Pelerhof is
closed.

NOT AN ILLUSION
BUT HIS CHILD
The Pitiful Discovery of a
Father in a Dime
Show.
AnOlficer Hurries the "Great
Barrel Mystery" Off to
Priscn.
She Was a Ward of the Childrens
Society, but Had Run Away
Frcm Her P ace.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Fed. 13. )
The most sensational act of an old-time
drama was repeated on Washington street
last night. A faiber while attending a
piace of amusement discovered his way
wara daughter under conditions that were
most revolting to him, called the police
and the gin was taken to the City Prison,
and is still thorp.
Rose ilenneuan, whose parents live at
Second and Grove streets, made a com
plaint to the authori.ies several months
a^o that her parents were ill using her,
and there was a hitter fi_-bt over the ques
tion of guardianship. Finally Rose suc
ceeded in convincing the court that her
father was not good to her, and at her re
quest Mrs. -ProscoU, secretary of the Chil
dren's Society, was â¢ granted letters of
guardianship.
Soon afterward Mrs. Prescott obtained a
piace for her warn with a family in East
Oakland, and from time to time received
reports that convinced her that Rose was
a good girl and that her story regarding
ill treatment by her parents was not un
founded.
Not many days aeo Rose left her posi
tion without informing her guardian and
obtained a situation as an actress in a
dime illusion show that opened up in a
vacant store oti Washington street, She
was advertised as a great barre! mystery,
and her act consisted in getting into a
barrel, which was then rolled all around
and shown to the public empty and a few
seconds later Rose would be materialized
from the same barrel.
Last night her lather and one of hi*
children were uptown, and Mennehan de
cided to take in the show. He was greatly
interested in the programme, and nothing
disturbed him till hi* li;t!e child said to
him, 'There's Rose." The old man
shouted as soon as be convinced himself
that the figure in a dress not to be de
scribed waH bis own daughter Rose. He
rushed info thesueet and enlisted the ser
vices of Officer Hynes and had his girl ar
rested.
He was so excited that he wanted the
officer to march the giri to the City Prison
with. -lit de ay, but Hynes insisted that, as
the girl was not costumed for a walk up
town, the father must wait patiently till
ghe prepared heiseif.
When booked at the City Prison Rose
defied her father to exercise auy authority
over her, and called attention to the fact
t at Mrs. Prescott was her legal guardian.
Chief Lloyd doubted tne girl's story, and
sent for the secretary, who was consider
ably surprised to find her ward undf r Â»nch
conditions. She ordered her to be de
tained until such time as she could lake
the necessary steps to send her to some
institution irora which she could not
escape to join an illusion show.

ANNEXATION LEAGUE.
Circulars Sent Out Describing the Bene
fits of Great r Oakland.
OAKLAND. Cal.. Feb. 13.â The scheme
to annex the territory oetween Oakland
and Berkeley is meeting with some oppo
sition. The Adeline Improvement Club
has issued a protest, signed by forty-live
voters, which they have submitted to the
City Council. They declare that, as the
Adeline sanitary district has completed
its system of sewers, the maj irity of
proi>erty-owners do not feel justified in
favoring annexation at the present time,
and do emphatically protest against the
annexation of the Adeline sanitary dis
trict.
The Annexation League is pursuing its
work with great activity. They have ju t
prepared a circular, whicn has been
mai ed to every voter in the outer district,
setting fortn the reasons why annexation
should take place. The greatest opposi
tion comes from the Piedmont sanitary
district, which has just been formed lor
the purpose of building a sewer sys tem.
and which, to a man, is opposed to an
nexation.

majority of the fights have been won,"
saiu he this afternoon. "Senate bill No.
0, aifeciine our electric light plant, has
passed both houses and Governor Budd,
who has a few trivial objections, will sign
it. I have explained to him that his ob
jections are not well founded and he as
much an admits it.
"The Harrison avenue annexation bill
will not pass. It is too far down on the
files and it was only after I arrived here
that it was due up out of the committee
pigeon hole. The library bill, making the
trustees elective < fficers, has passed and
will be signed by Governor Budd.
"Senator Andrus of Pomona has a bill
that needs watching, it makes the City
Attorney in all cities of this class ap
pointive instead of elective and should not
be allowed to pa.-s. I believe it is beaten,
although it may pass the Senate."

â  Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
man is slowly wasting away v;ltn nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the most severe pain. There
is no let up to the mental suffering- day or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and under
such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison and thus end all
his throubles. But providential inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and -vigor, and
he now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free. Now, when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.
lam not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men
suffering the mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would be cured at onca could
they but get such a remedy as the one that
cured me. Do not try to study out how I can
afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
to mall the information, but send for it and
learn that there are a few things on earth
that, although they cost nothing to got, are
worth a fortune to some men and mean a life-

The iollowing is the concluding para
j graph of a letter from the New York head-
I quarters, received by Messrs. Jones and
I Mascherini last night:
. We hope that you will start this work and
have your meeting at the earliest oossible mo
| meut. We wish to any that you must not feel
bound by any of our recommendations. We
send them only as suggestions, and will be
pleased with whatever methods you adopt in
organizing your chapter of the league. Yours
truly, Ethan Allen.
Speaking of the progress of the move
ment yesteiday. President Jones made
the following official statement:
: :; ;.; ; San Francisco, Feb. 13.
To all Friends and Sympathizers of the Cuban
League: We desire to say to the friends of the
Cuban League that we have overcome many
obstacles and made great progress since we
first undertook the work of organizing aid for
Cuba. Our list now contains more than "00
names. We have secured many committee
men and offers of aid and are about to begin
an active campaign on behalf of the down
trodden Cubans.
We solicit the aid and co-operation of all
friends of Cuba, and desire the names of all
who would aid us in the movement here.
The following letters show the general
feeling as expressed by what cornea in the
mails each day:
San Francisco, Cal., Feb. 2, 1897.
Faust Mascherini, Esq.â Dear Sir: Having
seen enough of Spaniards in Central and
South America to be convinced that Cuban lib
erty is to be desired by humanity, l gladly add
my name to those who are in favor of Cuba j
libra. Respectfully yours, al. Meyer.
824 Howard street, San Francisco.
The following letter from an ex-captain
shows that there is a misapprehension as
to the purposes of the movement here.
Secretary Mascherini said concerning the
writer's proposition: "We are not here
to raise an army or to ask anything against
the laws. To carry out what the writer
asks would get us all in trouble, but he
shows the feeling that exists throughout

Winters, Cal., Jan. 15, 1897.
J. H. Jones, San Francisco â Dear Sir: I see
you have been corresponding with the presi â¢ i
dent of the Cuban Junta at New York. Now I i
wish you would send me the address, as I |
want to write to them and I would like to
raise a company and take them to Cuba. I
can raise a company in two weeks. I have al
ready talked to a good many that are willing
to go just as soon as our Government recog
nizes the belligerency of Cuba. I have twice
been a captain and know how to drill and
handle men and lam an old soldier. I was in
the Tenth lowa Infantry, Company V. My
heart and soul arÂ»Â» with the poor Cubans. I
pray God to give them the victory. Please
give me any information of Interest you may
think best and oblige. Hoping to hear from
you soon, I am J. O. Jacks.
The following is another letter received

Faust Mancherini, Secretary Cuban Ltagvsâ
DearSik: lam pleased this morning at the
outlook of the great eau^e of Cuba Libre.
The noble stand taken by The Morning Call
is very cheering to all American lovers of
human liberty. My strength is failing and I
cannot go to the field and carry a gun, but my
brain and what energy there is left are at your
disposal. You may command me at any time
or place where my presence and counsel may
in the least assist you in this great work of
freeing those poor suffering patriots in thoir

struggle against the arrogant, blood-thirsty,
murderous Spaniards. Hasten the day when
this Government may see tit to show its love
of liberty and more true Americanism. Go
on, you and your friends and co-workers. All
praise for our noble Mayor Phe^an and The
Calj. May our people respond liberally and
quickly with moral and finuncial support is
the wish oJ your in sympathy, M. W, Willis.
Ii is the purpose of the local league to
co-operate in every particular with the
central body in New York and to pass
such resolutions and tate such steps as
are indicated from time to time by tiie
New York body. Mayor Phelan will
appoint the committee as soon as the local
leaders hand him the names and tell him
the time is ripe for the movement. A
mass-meeting will be held soon after the
appointment of the committee and
speeches will be made by prominent citi
zens. The league does not require that
those who join should favor the move
ment for tnii Government to take an
active part for Cuba. The only condition
is that the number desire the freedom of
the struggling Cubans and oppose the
extension of royalty and Spanish cruelty
on this continent.
Tug-of-War Tournament.
Widespread Interest is already manifested In
the coming big tug-of-war tournament which
is announced for the Mechanics' Pavilion,
commencing the 27th inst. The captains of
the ten team* have selected their men with
great care, and the nations they represent will
have worthy muscular representation. The
rule that requires members of teams to have
been born in the country their team represents
nas resulted in no little confusion, as Home of.
the captains have selected men 01 other na
tionalities because of their peculiar fitness
and experience. The man to suffer most be
cause of this is Captain DupliÃseaol the Cana
dian team. Ills famous anchor-man, Bob
Smith, being a native of Ireland, was given
that responsible position in the Irish team, a
change that Captain Hardnesty of the latter
team accepts with undisguised pleasure. Cap
tain Campbell of the Scotch team is exultant
over the acquisition of two new men from
Australia. They are veritable giants in stat
ute and strength, who are expected to do good
work. One of them Is a nephew of Donald
Dinnie, the noted Scotch exponent of brawn

THIEVES LOOTED
THE ALCAZAR
Twice Within a Week
They Stole Thespian
Eelongings.
A Wagon- Load of Costumes and
Make-Up Appliances Are
Missing.
Detectives Fail to Find Any C'ew to
the Maraudersâ List of Miss
ing Articles.
It is said that lightning never strikes
twice in the same place, but tue same can
not be told of burglars if the experiences
of the Alcazar Theater during the past
week go for anything.
Twice within seven days daring cracks
men have raided the place of amusement.
In each instance they carried away a
goodly load of the belongings of the
actors and actressas who play in the Al
cazar company.
The first burglary took place on Tues
day ni^ht after the performance was over,
and wtien the thenpians came for the
Wednesday night rendition of "The Pro
fes:-oi'' there was wailing and gnashing of
teeth not called for by the text of Ihe
play. The dressing-room was in a sad
state, clothing strewn about, costumes rent
! and man; of the articles missing. Close
scrutiny failed to show how the burglars
effected an entrance, but there was ample
evidence that they had come and gone
and made good use of their time while in
the theater.
Tbe tbespians made purchases of new
costumes and had almost forpotten ike
experience when it was repeated witu
even more serious results. On Friday
evening* tbe enterprising cracksmen
forced the entrance to the basement of
tbe theater and, judging from the appear
ance of the place when the house was
opened in tbe mornine, made a night of it.
The second visit was evidently made
with more deliberation and assurance
than tbe first and they did not overlook
anything portable that was valuable
enough to excite their cupidity.
Charles Bryant mourned the loss o!
three suits of clothes, a pair of tan shoes
and a razor. The latter article was par
ticularly missed, as tbe beard ol the
youthful actor has just begun to make its
appearance and he takes great care not to
let its presenca be known.
Gordon Foster, tht; stage manager, lost
an overcoat and lower garments and also
a razor.
Mr. Lerien will be compelled to replace
a suit of clothes that some cracksman is
now wearing.
Walter Beiasco's alligator valise, which
contained several pairs of gloves and a pair
of gold sleeve-buttons, was missing, and
Francis Bowers' pet neckties accompanied
a pair of trousers.
The ladies of the company fared as badly
a the men, and the to eve? evidently had
an eye to the dainty things in leminine
apparel, judging from the articles that
have thus far been missed.
Miss Tldball lost a handsome cloak, a
chatelaine and a lace pin set with pearls
and diamonds, which she valued very
highly.
Miss Bertha Foltz is minus a lace collar
and Miss coot and Miss Crosby will have
to purchase a new pair of white satin slip
pers each before they can take parts that
call for such footgear.
Miss Bates last a lorgnette and a lace
pin.
Miss Kmmerson bad a Japanese tele
scope basket, but that too is gone, and it
is presumed that the thieves packed the
other stolen articles in it to more easily
remove them from the premises.
Even the makeup materials and appli
ances of the artists were not spared, rouge,
brushes and cosmetics having disappeared
with the more valuable articles, and the
suspicion exists that some impecunious
barnstorming aggregation that is about to
assail the interior towns has taken to the
metnods of the cracksmen to gain the
necessary traveling outfit.
I Two members of the detective force
looked the despoiled dressing-rooms over
yesterday without finding auy clew to the
marauders.

A. Cailleau Going East to Make Big
Purchases in t'loakg aud
!Â»uits.
The many patrons of the well-known
cloak and suit house of Armand Cailleau
will be pleased to know that the circum
stances which prompted the sale now in
progress will not have the effect of forcing
him to retire from the business world.
While a considerable loss has resulted
from hurrying such an immense stock on
the market, Mr. Cailleau should feel rlat
terea with the distinction of havintr given
the money-savers the greatest banquet of
bargains ever known hereabouts.
Mr. Cailleau leaves in a tew days for the
East to negotiate for large supplies of
cloaks and suits of the latest pattern and
design, of which he is acknowledged
authority. Meantime the sale, which has
been a record-breaker for b g values at
big savings to the people, will continue at
his well-known establishment, corner of
Geary street and Grant avenue.
Cued a Frying-Pan.
Michael Frablzo, who lives on Green and
Dnpont streets, went home last night under
the influence oi liquor. He and his mother
in-law had a quarrel and the latter hit him
over the head with a frying-pan, inflicting a
severe scalp wound. Frabizo was xeken to the
Receiving Hospital, where his wounded scalp
was dressed.
An Arm Amputated.
Hans Peterson, a boy 10 years of age, was
playing around a donkey engine in a shipyard
in Souih San Francisco last evening, when his
left arm got caught in the gearwheels. It was
drawn in up to his elbow before the engine
was stopped. The boy was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital and Dr. Weil amputated the
hrm above the wrist.

On book.RARE RELICS OF THE FAMOUS CAHROC INDIANS OF C ALIFORNIA
OR^tiERB has just been placed on ex
| Ltion in the Aborigines room of
Jlf* :lie museum at Golden Gate Park a
collection of objects which were formerly
iho property of certain individual mem
bers of the Cahroc tribe of California
Indiana. The aggregation is the result of
â¢ nearly forty years of patient continuous
accumulation through purchase and gifts,
direct from the Indian?, ny John Daggett,
Superintendent of tue Mint, who has
lately donated the collection entire to the
museum.
Mr. Daggett has lone been a niine
owncr within tho territory of the original
habitat of these Indians, and from the
beginning of nis acquaintanceship with
them he has been tneir friend. He has
employed them, advised ihem, assisted
them. He is a great chief in tneir es
teem. Sympathizing with his penchant
for Ihe acquisition of objects of their use,
they exploited all sources in search of
them and brought them to him, some
times for pay, when parting with the par
ticular thing would otherwise entail too
.great a draft upon their resources, bui
. often they were bestowed eagerly as a
tribute of their regard.
The collection is believed to be the most
extensive in existence :ipj ertaining to a
single tribe of Indians. It has the further
feature of not being a body of hit and miss
curiosities, each without relation to the
"other, but it is a mute, descriptive record,
.a consecutive chain of silent evidence re
vealing all that obtains in the life of the
â / 'aliroc Indian. Every utensil or tool or
..irticle which enters into his domestic or
histrlbal existence, the seeds of his food,
ttie weapons of his chase, the fantastic
trinkets and habiliments of his festal
celebrations or his funeral solemnities, all
are numbered among the five hundred or
! more objects which comprise the exhibit.
Nor has this protracted and exhaustive
endeavor to collate the implements and
accouterments of this nation of savaee
Californians been of worth grpater than
rhe merit of the people would deserve.
* .The Cahrocs of all the California Indians
â  were and are the most entitled to civilized
regard. To the miserable "diggers" of
Central or Southern California they were
superior in every particular. In the vari
ous qualities in which as Indians they
excelled they approached more nearly the
Tuscaroras or tiie Iroquois of the Atlantic
slope or the Chero-kees of the middle
West. For in California there was usually
throughout among the native tribes
squalor, nakedness, darkness; they were
Ihe human animal. Vary, indeed, they
did, for as you entered the zone of aridity
' the environment of the poor human
creature became more scanty and barren,
anU as you approached the well-watered
and wood areas of the north his condition
â¢ . correspondingly relaxed.
It is to the circumstance of natural sur
roundings, therefore, more than to any
other cause that the superior qualities
.. -arid characteristics of the Cahrocs were
-. due. Though they number now only
. . about 700 souls and are all resident upon
the Hooj ah Reservation, yet in the days of
. lastcral California they roamed the wide
country in what is now Siskiyou County,
' bordering on the south bank of the
â¢ Klania;h and between the Trinity and
the Salmon rivers.
In this broad arf>a, bounded upon three
â  by streams ol white froth and blue
A crystal, in which swam the salmon and
â  tie trout, the country surface broken by
. mountains in which roamed in bands the

THE STORY OF THE UTICA MINE
Iyf was at least ten years af'Â»r my first I
â i acquaintance with Robert Eames that j
JJ 1 began to take notice of his sineular ]
peculiarities. We met first upon the deck |
of a sailing vessel, the Nancy Star, a-? we
were leaving the harbor of New York
"both profoundly stirred by reflections of â 
thafwhich we were leaving behind usâ
home, family and friends, and speculating
upon the probabilities of tne future and
what it had in store for us. I believe that
a. tear forced itself from my eyes at this
â¢moment, and unwilling that a display of
unmasculine weakness should b â¢ observed
I turned to my berth, but was arrested by
a remark of a fellow-passenger, who said
"THE MINE IS THERE! THE SPIRIT LEADS ME."
that he came from a portion of the
'State contiguous to my own and that he
had embraced the first chance of becom
inc acu tainted with me.
1 knew him at once, though I had never
Aokpn to h;m before, but his funnily was
<m â  well Known in our county and con
ffclered most rrpatable.
The acquaintance thus began soon
ripened in the constrained atmosphere of
the siiip to a close intimncy. Both*" of us
were just of age, each was in the prime of
early manhood, and as we knew each
other better we found a sympathetic
unioa of ideas influencing us, and long
before our arrival at San Francisco we bad
I were the Alodocs. below them and extend
| ing to the sea coast the Euhrocs. The
three names have a signilicance in the
Indian languageâ Modoc, "head of the
river"; Cabroc, "up the river," and
Euhroc, "down the river."
Food of the animal sort abounded, but
not less so than that of the vegetable king
dom. Above the clustered antelope nod
ded the pinon pine, rich with its large
cones, at the base of whose many scales
were the edible and nutritious seeds.
Hemming the forests grew the nianzanita
ehrub, with its wealth of berries, and the
' acorns, which to the Indians are a staple
j comparable to wheat in the civilized esti
j mation, fell irom trees whose dark thou
sands stretched over areas measurable
only by the scale of miles.
Toe Cahrocs were not nomadic. They
lived in tixed residences, grouped in vil
lages, always on the river bank. In the
exhibit are thirty or more photographs
showing these villages, their huts and
j their inhabitants. They had a peculiar
way of constructing a house. A large
round excavation, three or four feet in
i depth, was dug in the earth. About the
j sides of this were driven long poles whose
j ends were bent toward the center, in
! which position they were held by withes
jor sinews, and sometimes they were
j threaded, basket fashion, witn ferns. The
ends were trimmed to leave a circular
manhole in the center, whereupon the
mound was covered with earth to the
depth of several inches. A notched pole
was planted in the middle, which sus
tained the roof and provided a stairs, for
in ana out this hole, which served alike
for ingress of inmates and egress of smoke,
and down and up this pole the Indians
crawled like rats.
In this house they slept. In it during
winter they prepared their food and the
smoke with which it was always tilled gave
them sore eyes, one of the ever present
diseases of the tribe.
It was to this hut that the Cahroc gal
lant brought his newly purchased bride.
She was often pretty, for the Cahroc belles
are described as being pleasing even to
the Anglo-Saxon eye. With smooth hazel
skin, hazel brilliaut almond eyes, ovai
laces with red showing in the cheeks, full
figures, ample and well shaped busts and
rounded limbs, such a bride would be
i worthy ol purchase anywhere, and among
I the Cahrocs they came high. They were
; the property of their fathers and they
i were sold for value in money or other
j chattels. The greater the price the pater
| nal autocrat set upon them 'he more they
I were esteemed by their purchasing spouses
i and by society.
Tne only limit fixed to the number of
wives a man might accumulate was the
length of his strings of alncochick, the
number of his whits deerskins or the
; scalps of his red-topped woodpeckers.
i The first and last of these were currency
j and many specimens of both are shown in
| the Daggett collection. Allicochick are
' the shells which conchologists call denta
lum from their resemblance to teeth.
1 They are made by a genus of marine mol
lusks. The shell is long, tabular and coni
: cal. They were never attainable in their
! native state by the Cahrocs, but were se
cured in exchange from the Euhrocs, who
were partially a sea-going tribe.
Upon the length of the-e shells depended
their monetary worth. Unless they m as
ured irom the base to the tir&t joint of the
middle fingerâ a length of about two
inchesâ they were not specie, but useful
as fringe and n cklace ornaments. The
capitalists of the community invariably
had bars tattooed upon their arms, which
mutually agreed to join for.unes and to
stick together in our quest of riches so
long as fate compelled our remaining in
the Golden West. This was early in the
fifties, and for ten long and laborious
years we had loyally stood by each other
in sickness and in health, through good
and evil report and in all the mischances
of a miner's career. Tne end of the first
decade after our arrival found us fairly
weli to do. United our fortunes amounted
to $25,000. We had sold our la*t claim,
and with no interests in the interior we
decided to visit San Francisco and to taste
again some of the comforts and joys of
civilized lite and to take for a time a com
I plete respite from the harassing cares and
uncertainties inseparable from a minor's
occupation.
A rest of three months left us with ade
terminr.tion to embark in some enter
prises for which we were both calculated,
an'l after considering careiully the merits
of many locations, we came to the con
clusion to prospectâ¢ To describe our
weary tramps over the great quartz re
gions would be simply to repeat an experi
ence familiar to hundreds of thousands,
but after three months' industrious search,'
we finally located a claim in the upper aitN
tudes of Calaveras County, a country
which had up to that time been neglected

were servicable in computations of tins
sort. Tbe woodpecker medium, valued at
about $5 per *calp, was required to be of a
particular variety of woodpecker, lor there
were several of the species. Tl.e bird must
be a big fellow with a blacir bili, tbe red of
his bead bordered with black and no other
color. He was prized because he is ex
ceedingly difficult to shoot, is rarely trans
fixed upon an arro^v and even seldom
brought down by a shotgun.
The Cahrocs solved in a simple manner
the question of property possession and
transmission by heredity, which now ap
by the early prospectors, but which dis
played splendid surface indications of
riches hidden beneath the eround.
The way we finally decided upon this
locality made a deep impression upon my
mind, especially when the future came
with its after developments.
Ten days before we arr.ved upon the
spot, my partner, Eames, suddenly threw
bis pack from his shoulders and shouted
frantically:
"It is here! It is here!"
"What is here?" I replied rather
ungraciously, the sudden change of my
partner from depression to frantic joy had
so startled me.
"Ourmine," my partner answered. "It is
around here. We will find it if we search."
"How do you know?" was my next in
quiry.
"Because I have seen this place before.
It is all clear to me now. They have
guided me here and are pointing their
fingers toward the hill. They have prom
ised to lead me to wealth. Come on.
They are going before us. Let us follow."
In every other respect but this hallucin
ation about the unseen guide Eames was
quite himself. He shared the labors of
each day and in all of our conversations
no evidence of mental incapaciiy wa9 ob
servible. Pity and ?orrow for his strange
delusions qjite overpowered me at. times.
He, however, confidently asserted that
n stead of his being the mad one it
was J who was deluded. He would
prove, lie said, that the euide which
was leading him would not betray. We
would both be convinced of the truth be
fore long.
For a week after this conversation we
dragged our way over the pathless ranges,
myself the victim of the most violent de
pression, but "Bob" as nopeful and deter
mined as possible. Utterly fagged with
both mental and physical fatigue 1 ono day
threw inyse f upon the ground and swore
that I would no longer follow this silent
guide. Bob, prsyed, begged and appealed
to our loyal friendship that we should
stay together just a little longer, and then
we agreed that if in two more days the ob
ject of our bearch was not attained he
would consent to its Abandonment. The
next morning a ray from tne rising sun
shone upon a rock standing up from the
mountain's side about half a mile distant
from our camp.
"There is our mine, George. That is the
rock they have been pointing to for a week
past," said Eames.
The hope that the mirage that
my friend had been following for so long
was at last at its vanishing point nerved
me to follow his hurried footsteps with
my pick and hammer, only anxious to
know how cruelly he bad been deceived
into following intangible guides and
hoping tbat this sad experience would
cure my faithful friend of bis unhappy
malady. I saw him from a distance strike
the rock with his pick and eagerly grasp
the fragments. Then I saw him spring

rock," said he.
My friend had good grounds for his ex
travagant and hysterical elation. The
bowlder from which he had broken a great
piecj was solid quartz, with veins of pure
gold extending in every direction. Night
saw that rock broken into a thousand
pieces, and for days afterward we were
busy crushing the fragments and extract
ing the free goM. In all, our treasure
yielded us over 100 ounces, even with our
imperfect method of extraction. Our sea
son's work had been successful and I
urged a return to the bay.
My friend assented, and that night we
packed our belongings and prepared for
an early start. The visions that haunted
the mind of my partner seemed to have
been driven away in the tumultuous ex
citement which accompanied our find of
the bowlder and subsequent labors, and
I had hoped they would trouble us
no more. The nieht passed in the pro
foundest slumber, but in the morning Bob
asserted that bis guide had again ap
peared and had told him to search. Noth

unseen messenger, and I consented to

We did search the locality far and wide.
Nothing escaped our watchful observation
and we were rewarded. We found where
the bowlder hat become detached, and
only a short distance from the surface dis
covered the vein exposed â the source of
our present wealth.
Until winter came with its fierce blasts
we remained with our mine. Not a soli
tary prospector had disturbed us during
all tliat summer. Our share of gold with
which we t:ad commenced the summer's
work had doubled.
We brought the first news of the great
discovery of ours, and early in the suc
ceeding summer we again started for the
camp. But we were not alone. Thou
sands who had learned of the rich quartz

called our mine the Utica, after our home
in New York, and sold it afterward at a
sum which realized our greatest anticipa
tions. At this day it is the most produc
tive gold mine in the State and distributes
to its already rich stockholders over
$100,000 every month.
It is possible that we should have re
tained possession of the Utica but for a
sad affliction whic i befell my friend, Bob.

SCIENCE AIDS THE VETERAN.
i^\fj^ OLD veteran of the Union army,
Uiak i living in this City, who has been
4\"ltsÂ» suffering for forty years from in
juries received in the Civil War, was re
cently struck with the happy thought
that the X ray might be made a more
effectually influential friend to him than
any heretofore induced to work in his be
half. He is so much elated with the suc
cess of his appeal to this new agency that
he wishes the news to reacn a wide circu
lation, so that haply many other old vet
erans with similar cases to his own may
learn of the u-e to â which he put the radio
graph and profit by bis example.
The veteran is A. A. McLean, who was
a member of the Calfornia Cavalry Battal
ion, attached to the Second Massachusetts
Cavalry. This body of 500 men was the
only organized troop that went East from
California to serve in the Union army.
Mr. McLean was in tiny-two engage
ments, aud among a number of other
wounds received a severe one in his right
foot, which has been greater pain and im
pediment to him than all the others. On
the occasion of this painful injury his
horse was shot under him, and falling
violently upon the hard ground caught
the rider's foot beneath the crushing
weight. Mr. McLean was borne from the
field insensible His foot baa been in
jured, and the peculiarity was that it gave
no external evidence of the extent and
permanence of the detriment, so as to en
able a physician to give positive testi
mony to the fact, and thus enable the vet
eran to draw a pension, to which he was
clearly entitled if the proof of his disable
ment could be put before the Pension
Office in proper shape.
The problem of how to prove to the offi
cers of the Government thai the damaged
foot was a permanent impediment to his
activity has at las: been solved by the X
ray. Mr. McLean had his foot photo
graphed by a powerful instrument in the
office of Dr. E. 8. de Puy, with the result
that the internal condition of the foot is
shown so clearly that any competent
physician can now positively certify that
the injury to the foot is so great as to be
reason sufficient to demand for the vet
eran a pension.
This radiograph of McLean's foot has
been admitted as evidence by the Pension
Office and his claim riled for a hearing.
It is the first case of the kind from this
coast and the second on record at the Pen
sion Office. McLean supposed that he
was the hrst to think of introducing such
evidence, but in reply to his application
his lawyer sent him a letter saying he was
the second on record fend incloning the
following clipping from a Washington
paper:
The X ray has made its appearance at the
Pension Office. Abraham Sllverstein of New
York, tiled a photograph as proof in his claim,
showing how all the bones of his wrist were
shattered by a bullet wound. The external
appearance failed to convince the surgeons of
the fact, but the X radiograph is conclusive.
Thit is the first instance when the X ray has
been used in proving a pension claim.
Up to a very recant date toe courts,
ity. Their slyness was comparable only
to that of the coyote.
There was one feature in their civil sys
tem, however, which doubtless saved
them a great deal of trouble, and whose
benefits were twofold: First, if a husband
did not, after some experience, feel satis
fied with his wifa he could return her to
her father and receive his money back,
and second, he could with impunity kill
his mother-in-law. For any one else
whom he might be pleased to kill, how
ever, he must with sreed indemnify the
relatives of such person, else his own life
would be taken in reprisal. A few strings
of allicochick, equal in purchasing power
to about three 3 ? ears' labor of one man,
were deemed ample satisfaction for such
an injury.
Thus private revenge was the only pun
ishment which met the commission of
the crime of murder, and as it was profit
able for this to be vented it occurred that
a man had more concern evinced at the
manner of his demise than was given to
the method of his living. It was reckoned
that so long as one should continue to
live he could look out for himseif and his
property, and visit upon his offenders
such punishment as he considered their
crimes deserved ; but this he could not do
if the offense inflicted him with death.
The wealthiest man of the tribe was
entitled to be its chief. But his powers
were advisory, not coercive. rÂ£e had no
means to enforce bis suggestions. The
recipients of his views miirht accord their
conduct to them or not, and Infrequently
they did not. His official functions ap
pear to have been anomalous, which was
due to the fact of the tribe being a peace
loving one. Such was not the case with
warlike tribes.
Among the articles in the collection are
about twenty-rive baskets made by the
women of ferns, bark and roots. The
Cahrocs excelled In this art, and all the
designs which the Navajos put into their
blankets and the Oregon Klamaths shaped
into their bead work appear here woven
in the fibers of these baskets. The de
signs are artistic, often intricate, some
times involving geometrical figures, a
product which for excellence in workman
ship and ornamentation is not to be ex
celled by any civilized artisan of the craft.
Many of the baskets displayed are hats,
others are sip-nooks or trinket baskets,
yet others are shaped as the inverted
frustum of a cone, as receptacles borne
upon the backs of squaws sustained by a
ba^d attached to either side and spread
around the forehead of the carrier. Other
baskets are the mcasements of papooses
as transported upon their mother's backs,
and still others are large ovate affairs with
bemi-slobular lids, used as trunks or for
storago purposes.

the testimony of this wonderfnl X ray,
which can see through barriers impene
trable to human eyes; but Judge Le Fever
of the Colorado Superior Court has deliv
ered a decision in Denver upon a mal
practice case which admits the radiograph
as evidence. This breaks the ice of
hindrance from lack of precedent, and
the X ray will hereafter penetrate into
sucied precinct 3of the courts to enlighten
them on points which, without its aid,
would remain enshrouded in darkness.
It is probable that this decision by the
court influenced the Pension Office in the
resolution to accept such evidence from
the old soldiers, and in this connection it
will be of interest to read Judge Le
Fever's dslivery on the subject. It is as
follows:

that it is so wedded to precedent that it will

it possible to Icok beneath the Â»,issuesof the

close to a band of deer. In sucii manner
they captured, much of their game, as ia
order to make certain the shot of an ar
row the sportsman mu--t be much nearer
his quarry than if armed with a rifle.
One of the curious modes of decoying
game is to fasten to the ankles, Mercury
fashion, some strips of marten or other
fur, and thus protected by the tall grass
creep softly afield in direction of the
antelope. When approach has been made
as far as caution will allow, the hunter
rests upon his shoulders, his raised legs in
the air kicking vigorously, the skin
streamer curving in gyrating antics. Thi3
does not frighten the beasts, but it stirs
their curiosity; they move close to the
wiggling things to inquire what t^ey are;
then when very near they stand around
and look at it. They do not gaze long,
however, for in another inÃtant the other
end of Indian is up and he has an arrow
in the biggest buck.
But perhaps an object which suggests
the most pathetic memories is a picture
of the temescal with the ancient medicine
man standing close beside it. This house
is a sweat cabiuet where the sick go to rid
themselves of their disturbing humors,
the internal pains of which they believe
to be occasioned by gnawing snakes smug
gled into them through the spells of
malignant witches. They have only two
or three medicines in the nature of vege
table specifics, their chief treatment for
diseases being the sweat bath. The temes
cal is almost air tight. Fire is built within
it early in the fall and ia kept up until
spring. Healthy women, except the old
medicine crones, are not permitted to
enter it. The afflicted submits himself to
this sudorific corrective and when the
exudations have become excessivo, if he is
able to move, he rushes out into the open
air and plunges into the river.
If in spite of each peculiar remedy tho
patient insists upon dying he is "decently
interred." All his trappings and effects
! which comprise his wealth are put upon
j his body in the most effective full-dress
fashion. His allicochick is wound around
his neck, his ''Boston money" is crammed
into his mouth. The knees are then
pressed up against the chest, the body en
tirely covered with ht3 best deerskin or
bear robe and securely bound with sinew.
The stout chief then throws this upon
bis bacK and heads a procession of the
tr be moving toward the burial cave.
While en route he strikes up a doleful
tune in a song, in which he recounts tha
many virtues of the deceased and be
wails his loss. In this lamentation all
voices join. When the cave is reached
the bundle is deposited therein in a sit
ting position, the song is ended, and
thenceforth no man dare, under punish
ment of death, utter the name of the de
ceased.
In the Jong study which Mr. Dapgett
has made of these Indians, his intimate
associations and deep sympathy with
them have enabled him to present this
most curious and interesting of the Cali
fornia tribes with a completeness only at
tainable through such diligence as his ef
forts have engaged. He has prepared
two lectures upon the subject, which ne

and unequal pressure upon the terminal
nerve filaments contained in the inter

pain and interference with motion. When
an experienced surgeon sees this picture
he knows at once that the applicant for
the pension does not exaggerate in stat
ing that the pain is so acute and tue diffi

him to the pension lor disabled veterans.
Without this piciure the penMon 'Ulcers
might have firmly believed Uw Â«â¢ ... .jU ant's
representations, but the testimony neces
sary for compliance with the lnw could
not have been obtained, and the veteran
of many battles would have had to bear
his lifetime pain without even the
mitigation of the moderate pension al
lowed for such cases.
Speaking of the great benefits now
being conferred on humanity by the dis
covery of the X ray, Mr. McLean men
tioned that his lather had carried a bullet
lodged in his hip for forty years, to his
serious inconvenience and pain, Ii had
to be dressed twice a day. Had he lived

The result of Mr, McLean's successful
plan of getting his case before the . Pen
sion Office in effective shape will probably
be thai many more veterans oi the Civil
War will learn how to make their true
condition unmistakably known, so as to
draw the increased pensions they are en
titled to. If this is accomplished it will

M'^ISAD VESTURES? Wall, if I were
ft an author by profession I could
_3 make a pretty big book of tne ad
ministrative mishaps which befell me
during the three years I spent in Corsica
as legal adviser to the French Prefecture.
Here is one which will probably aam-c
you:
I had just entered upon my duties at
Ajaccio. One morning I was at the club,
readiDg the papers which iiad just arrived
from P.iris, when the Prefect's man
servant brought me a note, hastily written
in pencil: "Come at once; I want you.
"We have got the brigand, Quastana." I
uttered an exclamation of joy and went off
as fast as I could to the Prefecture. 1
must tell you that, under the Empire, the
arrest of a Corsicau banditto was looked
upon as a brilliant exploit, and meant
promotion, especially if you threw a cer
tain dash of romance a!x>ui it in your
official report.
Unfortunately brigands had become
scarce. The people were getting more
civilized nnd the vendetta was dying out.
If by chance .1 man did kill another in a
row, or do something which raade it ad
visable for him to keep c: ar of the nolice,
he generally bolted to Sardinia instead of
tarn ing brigand. This was not to our
likine; for no brigand, no promotion.
However, our Prefect had succeeded in
rinding one; he was an old rascal. Quas
tanaby name, who to avenge the murder
of his brother had killed goodness knows
how many teople. He had been pursued
with vigor, but had escaped, and after a
time the hue and cry had subsided and
he had been forgotten. Fifteen years had
passed, and the man had lived in
sion ; but our Prefect, having heard of the
affair and obtained a clew to his where
abouts, endeavored to capture him, wiih
no more success than his predecessor
We were beginning to despair of our pro
motion; you can imagine how pleased I
was to receive the note from my chief.

THE BRIGAND.
f I found him in his study talking very
I confidentially to a man 01 true Corsicau
! peasant type.
"This is Quastana's cousin." said the
Prefect to me in a low tone. "He lives in
ihe little village of Solenzara, just above
Porto Vecchio, ana the brigand pays him
a visit every Sunday evening to have a
game of scopa. Now it seems that these
j two had some words tb? otne-r Sunday and

j over to justice, and, between you and me,
[I believe he means it. But as I want to
i make tne capture myself, ana in as brii
j liant a manner as possible, it is advisable
; to take precautions in order not to expose
j the Government to ridicule. That's what
I I want you for. You are quite a stranger
! in the country and nobody knows you; 1
want you to go and sea for certain if it
really is Quastana who goes to this man's
house."
"But I have never seen this Quastana,"
I beean.
My chief pulledout his pocket-book and
i drew forth a photograph much worse for
wear.
"Here you are!" he exclaimed. "The
I rascal had the cheek to have his portrait
1 taken last year at Porto Vecchio!"
While we were looking at the photo the
peasant drew near, and I saw his eyes
flasli veugetully ; but the look quiefcly van
ished and his fate resumed ita usual stolid
; appearance.
"Are you not afrnid that the presence of
i a stranger will frighten your couein and
1 make him stay away on the following
' Sunday ?' we asked.
"No!" renlied tne man. "He is too
fond of cards. Besides, there are many
new faces about tere now on account of
the shooting. PL say that this gentleman
â  has come for me to show him where the
game is to bs found."
Thereupon wo made an appointment
for the next Sunday, and the fellow

The mate had hitched on to a regular

by "sounding" till nearly all tin line
was out. Then he appeared on top again,
but be'ore they could haul up to him he
was off once more at racing speed, drag
ging them away from the ship. So the
conflict went on. As the arternoon drew
to a dose the question of cutting clear was
discussed, but the majority applied the
Yankee whalers' dictura, "a stove boat or
a dead whale," and held that the fish
could not Ja-t much longer, and that
the night being fine, the ship would
soon pick them up. It was nearly dark
when they sot up to him and made play
with the lances till he "spouted thick

walked off without the least compunction
for his dirty trick. When he was pone
the Prefect impressed upon me the neces
sity for keening the matter vary quiet, be-
I cause he intended that nobody else should
share the credit of the capture. I as
sured him that I would not breathe a
word, thanked Dim for his kindness in ask
; ing me to assist him, anct we separated to
gr> to our work and drea ni of promotion.
The next morning I ;et out in full
shooting costume ami took the coach
I which does th* journey from A jaccio to
i iiastia. For those who love nature there
[ sno better ride in the world; but I was
I too busy with my castles in the air to
I notice any of the beauties of the land
scape.
At Bonifacio we stopped for dinner.
When I got on the coach again, just a
little elevated by the contents of a good
sized bottle, I found that I had a fresh
' traveling companion, who had taken a
seat next to me. He was an official at
Biistia, and I had already met him; a
; man about my own age/and a native of
; Paris l:ke myself. A decent sort of fel
| low.
You are probably aware that the admin
is!ration, as represented by the Prefect,
etc., and the majistrature never get on
well together; in Corsica it is worse than
elsewhere. The seat of the administra
tion is at A jaccio, that of the magistrature
at Bas'.ia; we two therefore belonged to
' hostile parties. But when you are a long
way irom home and meet some one from
your native place you forget aIJ else and
talk of the old couritry.
We were fast friends in less than no
time and were consoling each other for
being in "exile" as we termed it. The
bottle of wine had loosened my tongue,
and I soon told him in strict confidence,
that 1 was looking forward to going back
to France to take up some good post as a
reward for my share in the capture of

scattering occupants and gear in tbe sea-
It was his last effort â the final. A swirl
of foam-beeten, blood-tinged water, and
the fish floated dead.
Only four of IHe crew came to the sur
face â the other two were not seen again.
Probably stunned or entangled in the
gear, they went to their last account with
a struggle. The survivors held on the un
turned boat ana reviewed matters. Night
was closing in and, strain their eyes as
they might, they could see nothing of the
ship. Then they attempted to right the
boat to ascertain tie extent of the dam
age. This cost another life, one of the
hands disappearing suddenly. With the
fear of shares in their hearts, the three
who were left clambered on to the bust's
bottom. Tiien came the struggle with
cousin's house one Sunday evening.
When my companion got off the coach at
Porto- Vecchio we felt as though we had
known each other for years.
1 arrived at Solenzara between 4 and 5
o clock. The place is populated in winter
by workmen, fishermen and customs offl
als, but in summer every one wno can
shifts his quarters up in tbe mountains on
acco unt of fever. The village was, there
fore, nearly deserted when I reached it
that Sunday afternoon.
I entered a small inn and had some
thing to eit, while waiting for Matteo.
Time went on, and the fellow did not put
in an appearance; the innkeeper began to
look at me suspiciously, and I felt rather
uncomfortable. At last there came a
knocK, and Matteo entered.
"He has come to my bouse," he said,
raising his hand to his hat. "Will you
follow me there?"
We went outside. It was very dark and
windy; we stumbled along a stony path
for about three milesâ a narrow path, full
of small stones and overgrown with luxu
riant vegetation, which prevented us from
going quickly.
"That's my house," said Matteo, point
ing among the bushes to a light which
was flickering at a short distance from us.
A minute later we were confronted by a
b!g dog, who barked furiously at us. One
would have imagined that he meant to
Btop us going further along the road.
"Here, Urucclo, Eruccio!" cried my
*!), ide hen - leaning toward me, he said :
"That's Quaatana'a dog; a ferocious
animal. He has no equal for Keeping
watch." Turning to the dog again he
called out: "That's all right, old fellow!
Do you take us for policemen?"
The enormous animal quieted down and
came and sniffed around our iegs. It was
a splendid Newfoundland dog with a
thick, white, woolly coat, which had ob
tained for him the name of Bruccio (white
cheese). He ran on in front of us to the
house, a kind of stone hut with a large
hole in the roof, which did duty for both
chimney and window.
In the center of the room stood a rougn
table, arouna which were several "seats"
made oi portions of trunks of trees,
hacked into shape with a chopper. A
torch, stuck in a piece of wood, gave a
fl ckering light, around which flew a
swarm of moths and otber insects.
At the table sat a man who looked I'k.e
an Italian or Provencal fisherman, with a
shrewd, sunburnt, clean - shaven face.
He was leaning over a pack of cards and
was enveloped in a cloud of tobacco
smoke.
"Cousin Quastana," said Matteo. as we
went in, "this is a gentleman who is going
shooting with me in the morning. He
will sleep here to-nieht so as to be close to
the spot in good time to-morrow."
When you have been an outlaw and had
to fly for your life you look with sus
picion upon a stranger. Quastana looked
me straight in ths eyes for a second ; then,
apparently satisfied, he saluted me and
took no further notice of me. Two
minutes later the cousins were absorbed
in a game of scopa.
It is astonishing what a mania for card
playinc existed in Corsica at that time,
i and it is probably the same now. The
| clubs and cafes were watched by the
police, for the young men rained them
-1 selves at a game called bouillote. In the
I villages it was the same; the peasants
| were mad fora game at cards, and when

the sea, flung them off as often as they
bestrode her, for there was nothing by
which they could retain their hold. At
last one srid he bad "had enough," ani,
with a farewell message, gave up, leaving
now only the mate, Johnson, and the
boat-ateerer.
With words of encouragement to each
other, these two continued the fight.
After great difficulty Johnson mannered
to shove the plug out of the "garboard
strake," and then was able to keep his po
sition across the keel of the boat by in
serting hi-- right forefinger â his compan
ion holding on to him. The blackness of |
night over and about them; tne eternal I
swish of wat*r ready to engulf them as it
had cngulfe 1 their companions; no signs
of heip. Stul, they clung and hoped.
All at once Johnson felt hies comrade's
grip sh'.cken, as with a moan the man fell
into the sea. His first impulse was to at
tempt a rescue, but he found that he
couid not now detach himself from his
place â his numb finger had co swollen
as to completely block the hole. He,
"the last of six," was left alone. So the
night dragged on.

On the Derwent a diligent watch was
kept up through the hours of dark
ness â tne vessel making short boards to
windward the while. Lights were burned
and guns lired at intervals. At first signs
of daylight eager eyes restlessly swept the
horizon. It was nearly noon when one
of the lookout men reported large num
bers of birds ahead, almost in tbe vessel's
course. Then they sighted a dark object,
which was at first mistaken for a whale.
As they got closer they made it out to be
n boat with a figure astride it. It was
Johnson, frantically waving his free arm
and yelling to frighten the birds, which
every now and then swooped down at him,
A boat's crew was soon to his relief, but
before they could remove him they had to
chop the plank to release his finger. He
could not have fallen off had he wanted
to.
It was a thoroughly unnerved man they
received on board. Now, that the worst
was over, Johnson became like a fright
ened infant, sobbing convulsively and
ta.king incoherently, and clutching and
holding on to everything within grasp as
they bore him along the deck. He
tnougtu of and knew nothing beyond
holding on for dear life, and bis arms had
to be secured ere he could be carried down
the narrow companionway which led to
bis berth.
He pulled roundâ though he lost his
faithful finger â and fastened to many
another whale. â Tahune Linah in Sydney

they had no money they played for their
pipes, knives, sheepâ anything.
I watched the two men with great in
terest as they sat opposite each other,
silently playing the game. They watched
each other's movements, the ca r ds either
face downward upon the table or carefully
held so that the opponent might not
catch a glimpse of them, and gave an oc
casional quick glance at their "hand"
without losing sight of the other player's
lace. 1 was especially interested in watcb
ing Quastana. The photograph was a
very good one, but it could not reproduce
the sunburnt face, the vivacity and agility
of movement, surprising in a man of his
age, and the hoarse, hollow voice peculiar
to those who spend most of their time ip
solitude.
Between two and three hours passed in
this way, and 1 had some difficulty in
keeping awake in the stuffy air of the hut
and the lons stretches of silence broken
only by an occasional exclamation :
"Seventeen!" '-Eighteen!" From time
to time I was aroused by a heavy gust of
wind or a dispute between tne players.
Suddenly there was a savage bark from
Bruccio, like a cry of alarm. We all
sprang up, and Quastana rushed out of
the door, returning an instant afterward
and seizing his gun. With an exclama
tion of rage he darted out of the door
again and was gone. Matteo and I were
looking at one another in surprise, when
a dozen armed men entered and called
upon us to surrender. And in less time

IDyLS OF THE CALIFORNIA FIELDS
The J^aturalist-at-Large Expatiates Eloquently on the Subject of
Small Beginnings
Tf^XÂ«ERE in the canyon I have come
fr^Hj^ upon a great redwood stump, level
4^-1^ as a table, smoothly covered with
an tm era Id cloth of short, thick moss and
set out with tiny lichen cups for the fai
ries' afternoon tea. The guests have not
arrived, so there is no reason why we
should not sit down and study the texture
of this fairy table-cloth â more beautiful
than any fabric that ever came from the
loom. ',^V
The mosses are always lovely and invit
ing in their suggestion of coolness and
rest, but to me they never seem so charm
ing as in the early spr ingtime, wten
everything is finall and fine. They are so
closely associated with the beginnings of
things that one instinctively looks for
them when the oui-ot-doors year is new.
Tney belong to the earliest states of life
and played an important part in the great
physical drama enacted upon this earth
ere man appeared. They followed closely
upon tbe heels of the primitive vegeta
tion â the algse and lungi. The very low
est orders of plant life are found in the
sea. After these we find tne mosses and
lichens, and proceeding upward come
upon the ferns, the palms and at last tbe
stately pine, the latter a genuine tree,
which the palm is not. We may trace the
origin of all back to the primeval green
scum that gathered on the surface of
water before any other life appeared.
Ihus ancient is the origin of the deli
cate table-cloth here that feels like fine,
soft plush beneath my band. Its history
is as honorable as it h ancient; its office
in the economy of nature as useful as It is
humble. It is a history of faithful, con
stant service, an office of attendance upon
the beginnings of life, of preparation for
and protection of things destined to higher
uses than itself. The mighty ferns, the
giant horsetails of the carboniferous age
were useful in purifying the primeval at
mosphere and rendering it fit to sustain
animal life, but before these could grow
at all the mosses had to make ready for
them. They did in that early age ex
actly wha( we see them doing to-day.
When the driving winter rain beats down
upon the sides of the canyon the earth
would be carried by it into the stream be
low, did not the thick, ?oft moss, slowing
everywhere about us, catch the water, like
great sponges, and soak it up before it
can rush down the steep inclines, washing
the surface to bedrock. The moss spreads
over earth and rocks and prostrate trees.
It carpets the soft, boggy places with a
green surface that binds all together, and
by the aggregate forces of its frail life pre
vents landslides. If we try to pull up
some of it from the ground hero we shall
see how tenacious is the Hold it main
tains. Yet how tender it seems, in
height but an infinitesimal fraction of an
inch, it shows under my pocket magnify

Handcuffed and pusned about by one and
another we reached the bottom of the slope,
where a prison van was waiting vs â a vile
box, without ventilation and full of ver
min â into which we were thrown and
driven to Bastia, escorted by gendarmes
with drawn swords. â¢
A nice position for a Government of
ficial !
It was broad daylight when we reached
Bat-tia. The Public Prosecutor, the colonel
of the gendarmes and the governor of the
prison were impatiently awaiting us. I
never saw a man look more astonished
than the corporal in charge of the escort
as, with a triumphant smile, he led me
to these gentlemen and saw them hurry
toward me with all sorts of apologies and
take off the handcuffs.
"What ! Is it you?" exclaimed the Pub
lic Prosecutor. "Have these idiots really
arrested you? How did it come about â
what is the meaning of it? '
Explanations followed. On the previous
day the Public Prosecutor had received a
telegram from Porto- Vecehio, informing
him of the presence of Quastana in the
locality, and giving precise details as to
where and when he could be found. The
name of Porto- Vecehio opened my eyes;
it was that traveling companion of mine
who had played me this shabby trick!
He was the Prosecutor's deputy.
"But, n?y dear sir," said the Public
Prosecutor, "whoever would have expected
to see you in shooting costume in the
house of the brigand's cousin ! We have
given you rather a bad time of it, but I
know you will not bear malice, and you
will prove it by coming to breakfast with
me." Then turning to the corporal, and
pointing to Matteo, he said : "Take this
fellow away; we will deal with him in the
morning."
HE DARTED OUT OF THE DOOR AGAIN.
ing-glass a mass of tiny, green, starlike
growth, with almost imperceptible, hair
like roots, yet it does a giant's work. This
stariike form is characteristic of primitive
growth. It persists in many plants, and
we s c it in a number of the low orders of
animal life that inhabit the sea. We may
note it in forming crystals of ice and in
the snowflakes.
But our moss performs still an
other service than protecting the earth
Irom the soaking rain?. It prepares the
way for oth.r vegetation. Here upon
these great masses of rock it ha 3 grown,
piling up upon itself until it has formed a
thick, moss-covered mold, and growing in
it are a number of plantsâ iris, soaproot,
wild begonia and half a dozen other things,
whose seeds have found lodgment in the
moss and grown down through it to the
solid rock. See wbere this soaproot has
wedged itseli into a cleft of the rock itself.
These growths will in turn pass away,
leaving their roota and stocks to bind the'
soil still more closely together. Wind
blown dust and bits of. earth will lodge
against them and be held by them until
future generations may plow and culti
vate rich loamy fields where now with
my bare fingers I can scrape away the
tnin leaf and moss mold to the bare rocks.
Thus much on the surface about our
pretty table-cloth, but about the mosses
themselves there is much to learn that
well repays study. There are so many
varieties, from the microscopic liverworts
that cover walls and moist stones to the
branched leaf mosses, often several inches
in height The immense peat bogs of the
old country are largely thick growths of
bog moss, the green moss on tbe top being
merely the tips and branches of the orig
inal plants, long since dead and incorpor
ated with the substance of t c peat. Tais
is a singular characteristic of many moss
growths. Some, perhaps most varieties,
propagate by spores, but others grow by
ihe branches traveling off from the parent
stock and being separata plants, as some
higher orders of vegetation send out "run
ners" that strike down and root inde
pendently of the parent
We may learn much of and about
even these humble green mosses, but
we shall miss the highest lesson of all if we
fail to see and realize their beauty, for
this, after all, is the one thing we humans
can bring to nature. The brutes have
a dim perception of her usefulness, but
only man knows that she is beautiful, and
he learns the lesson only as nis awakened
soul acquires the power to see. It re
quired all the life and learning that has
gone before us to bring you and me to the
point where we know that these little star
like mossheads are beautiful, yet â
If we get simple beauty, and naught else,
We get about ibe best thing God invents.

The unfortunate Matleo remained dumb
with frigtit; he looked appealingly at me,
and I, of course, could not do otherwise
than explnin matters. Taking the prose
cutor to one side, I told him that Matteo
was really assisting the Prefect to capture
the brigand: but as I told him about th^t
matter i.ia lace assumed a hard, judicial â 
expression.
"I am sorry for the Prefecture," he said;
"but I have Quastana's cousin, and I
won't let him go! He will be tried with
some peasants, who are accused of having
3jpp!ieti the brigaud with provisions."
"But I repeat that this man is really in
the cervice of the Prefecture." I protested.
"So much the worse for the Prefecture,"
said he with a laugh. "I am going to give
the administration a lesson it won't forper,
and teach it not to meddle with what
doesn't concern it. There is only one
brigand in Corsica, and you want to take
him! He's my game, I tell yon I The
Prefect knows that, yet he tries to forestall
me! Now I will pay him out. Matteo
shall be tried; he will, of course, appeal to
your side; mere will be a great to do, and
the brigand will be put on his guard
against his cousin and gentlemen of the
Prefecture who go shooting."
Well, be kept his word. We had to ap
pear on behalf of Matteo, and we had a
nice time cf it in court. I was the laugh
ing-stock of the place. Matteo was ac
quitted, but Ire couid no longer be of use
to us, because Quastana was forewarned.
He had to quit the counlry.
As to Quastana he was never caught. He
Knew the country and every peasant was

in the exquisite grays and reds and black
of the lichens dotting our table-cover, or
crusting the surface of the higher rocks
and the branches of oak and hazel every
where about us. The lichens love pure
air and are never found wnere the atmos
phere is tainted. They derive all their
nutriment from the air, through the
moisture therein. The plants are the
only really self-supporting things in na
ture. They not only support themselves,
but the whole animal world, for they man
ufacture the food which we consume and
form the wood, the coal and the peat
which we humans burn for artificial
warmth. Even these primitive forms of
plant life are of great use to mankind.
The lichens here are beautiful enough to
justify their being, but they furnish us
with many of our most valuable dyes, and
their nutritive and medicinal properties
have long been known to man. Modern
science is inclined, it is true, to regard
their medicinal value as somewhat apo
cryphal, although Iceland moss is still ki
popular article of the druegist's stock-i^
trade. It is a constant and useful article
of food in the country whence it derives
its name, as is also the well-known "rein
deer moss," and many other lichens of
the far north. Solomon In all his glory
would have presented a far less brilliant
appearance had not the rich scarlet and
yellow and purple pigments derivable from
the lichens been known to the ancients.
The quaint, picturesque growths are
perennial sort of things. The moss on
this green stump is probably a thing of
yesterday, but the lichens may have been
about the edge, exactly as they are grow
ine to-day, since the tree was cut down,
some fifty years ago. Tho plants have
this peculiarity of growing with great ra
pidity for a time and then rema:ning sta
tionary, apparently changeless, s-ometimes
for centuries. Then, under some recur
ring atmospheric condition, they will sud
denly revive and grow again. Even speci
mens that have for years been kept,
within doors will sometimes do this on rt
exposure to moisture and fresh air, so
miraculously persistent is life in this little
organized vegetation.
Transparent, soft, amber-colored masses
of jusi-forming lichen hang from dÂ«Â»ad

which are considered by the City Fathers
to come under the head of "nuisances" ;

covers a good deal of ground legally, there
are certain things unquestionably belong

takes no cognizance. If it did we should

Who that has had the ill- fortune to walk
several blocks behind a man who, saun
tering along, evidently on most excellent
terms with himself, allows his cane, held
loosely in his hand, to d-r-a-g along on
the pavement continuously, can ever for
get or wish to repeat the experience?
The noise produced by this apparently in
nocent performance is so strident, so grat
ing and so absolutely torturing that it can
be heard by a sensitive person through all
the oti.er noises of the busy street, and
the man who is the cause of it is certainly
a nuisance of the most pronounced kind
in the opinion of those who suffer through
his thoughtlessness. __
Another variety of man is prone to carry
his cane or umbrella under nil arm at
such an angle as to seriously endanger
the eyes and persona of those walking
behind him.
Of course this is sheer carelessness and
not deliberate malice by any means on
the partof tne individual who thus threat
ens the well-being of his fellow-pedestri
ans. If it were, however, the custom in
this country as it is in Germany for any
one noticing the menacing altitude of the
weapon in question to strike it down with
linn hand and without comment such a
1 roceeding would be a salutary lesson to
the owner thereof, and if the act were
repeated whenever occasion arises our
streets wonld soon be freed from a nuisance
which is really a dangerous one.
Another nuisance, not dangerous but
decidedly exasperating, is the man who en
tertains himself by whistling on the street
cars. There are many varieties of him â
Home young, some middle-aged, and ail of
t:.em old enough to know better.
Some of them, a very few, whistle in
tune, but many there be, alas! who do
not. Some whistle softly and medita
tively, as though holding sweet musical
communion with their inner selves ; but the
great majority whistle with an insistant
shrillness which pierces through the un
happy hearers' ears like unto a two-edged
sword.
Some whistle popular songs, some dance |
music: others, more ambitious, essay op- I
eratic airs. But whatever they whistle, or !
whether they whistle well or ill, certain it
i- that any one witu at all sensitive ears
who is compelled to ride any distance in

THRILLING LIFE STORY OF A NOTABLE PIONEER WOMAN OF THE WILD WEST.
HPSLHKRE is now living in San Fran
Â£1 -^ cisco. at 415 Eddy street, a most
JJLf \ notable woman â one who has been
closely identified with some of the most
stirring events in the country's history.
She is Mrs. Selina Dodge Truett, and her
father was General Henry Dodge, the in
trepid Indian-fighter who conquered I
Black Hawe, the cruel and bloodthirsty !
red dcv.l who led the Sac and the Fox
Indians against the hardy pioneers of
lowa, Illinois and Wisconsiu in the early
'30' s. â¢
Mr?. Truett is now 78 years of age, but
neither in personal manners norconversa
tion does she show her very extreme age, \
and no one unacquainted with her History |
â ftould consider the interesting lady more !
than 60 years of age. And yet her early j
life was spent amid scenes of savage war- j
fare, and she and thote she loved were |
daily exposed to awful dangers, whiie a j
fate most horrible hungabove their heads, i
Yet this remarkable woman, at the age of '
almost four score years, sits and chats
most interestingly with those who call j
upon her, and is a most amiable hostess.
No family was mor* prominent than i
hers in the stirring times that marked the j
early settlement of Illinois, Wisconsin and
lowa, and no names are more lustrous !
in the annals of those trying times than
those of her father, General Henry Dodge, ,
and her brother, General A. C. Dodge, I
both of whom, on the field of battle and
in the legislative balls of the Nation,
made their rower and influence ielt on be
half of the settlers.
But she can trace the fighting stock
from which she came back farther than
these â to Dr. Israel Dodge, her paternal
grandfather, who lived in the province of j
Louisiana before it became territory of the I
United States, and who fought valiantly i
in t'je War of the Revolution; was:
wounded at Brandy wine; served at the
extreme outposts on the Mississippi, and i
after the revolution underwent all the ex
posures and perils of those who fought ;
upon "the dark and bloody ground" in j
Kentucky.
Mrs. Truett is very modest and is quite
dHÃ<lent in telline of the stirring events of
her lile. limn she feels herself apart from |
this world. Her interest in the things of j
this life began to wane after the death of!
her husband, and has continued to do so, j
until she feels very little personal concern i
in the passing show. After a life of varied I
and thrilling experiences, she has retired I
within herself and tranquilly awaits
death, firmly believing that when she j
passes from this earth it will be to be re- i
united to her dearly beloved husDand who i
has gone before.
"I now am through with this world,''
the old lady said the other day. "I no
lonper take interest in earthly things. I
think 1 can say, like St. Paul. 'I've fought â 
the good light.' I am ready to go. My !
comfort lies hern," and Mrs. Dodge drew
from her pocKet a rosary and a crucifix, on
which she looked fondly.
Selina Doage was born at St. Lora, near
the old French village of St. Genevieve,
below St. Louis, the oldest settlement on
the west eide of the Mississippi. It still
exists, and French manners and customs
and a patois still prevail there. The
Dodge home then was on the Selina
River, where Henry Dodge owned Jarge
salt works. 'I'his daughter was named
Selina after the river on whose banks the
family lived. Here at her birthplace Se- \
lina Dodge spent tne first years of her life, i
She hns but little recollection of them
now. But the monotony of the existence I
on the Selina was soon to be broken.
In 1827 Henry Dodge decided to follow
the tide of immigration that had net to
ward the Feon River lead mines. He He

"We.l, 'twoukln't do to have her dis

he had inherited from his father. He
promised them that hÂ« would set them

I he kept, and in the dark days of Indian
! warfare that followed these negroe*, in
; tbe absence of the white men, stood alone
i the barriers between the savages and the
i women and children of the whites.
While the women and children of the
! expedition were inconstant apprehension
; during the early stages of the journey of
; attacks from Indians and torture and hor
[ rible death at the bands of the savages, it
was not until they reached the site of the
i present city of Rock Island that their
i liveliest fears of being butchered by the
: redskins were excited. This was a favor
ite trysting ground of the big chiefs of the
! Sacs, the Foxes and at times of the Win

and their fellow-voyagers at this place in
1827. Black Hawk wa3 there, and she re
members having seen him. She saw him
thereafter, when she was older and had a
! greater acquaintance with the Indians,
and talkÂ« (1 io him in tbe innocent fear of
j childhood.
This place of "the gathering of the
( chiefs" was the largest Indian town in the
i Northwest then, and on the day of the ar
rival there of the party of pioneers, of
| which the present Mrs. Selina Dodge
I Truett was a very young member, there
' were gathered there such braves as Black
Hawk. Keokuk, Poweshick, Wapcllo and
j Mahaska. These chie.s and their follow
; ers were all decked in their gayest and
j gaudiest attire and wore their brightest I
i war paints. The effect upon the women I
I and children of the company can well be
j imagined ; but they were all of hardy pio
j neer stock and bravely pursued their
I journey.
j The company of pioneers arrived in
, Galena, 111., on the Fourth of July, 1827,
j to find the people of the town in the throes
oi an Indian alarm. Tbe Winnebagos
I were upon the warpaih and had commit

| the vicinity of Prairie dv Chien. The
savages had fir d upon keelboats in the
river ana killed their occupants and were
! then threatening to exterminate all the
; miners and settlers in tbe Territory. From
I that time on until several years afterward
Selina Dodge knew all the terrors ot In
dian warfare. For weeks at a time site
and other members of her family were
surrounded by howling, often drunken
and irazy, savages. Their lives were im
periled, and at times fate worse than
death at the hands oi the Indians con
fronted them.
Upon his arrival at Galena Henry
Dodge, because of his valor in the War of
1812, was asked to take command of an
armed force to be raised to defend the
i mining district. He accepted the com
i mand and moved his family to a place
' ihat became known as Dudgeville, forty
| five miles northeaÂ«i of Galena.
At Dodeevilie Mrs. Truett as a child
! passed through scenes and incidents that
made the stoutest hearts quail. "Our
Home there," she said to the writer, "was
in a small blockhouse, whose walls were

Mrs. Truett's brother, August-is C.
Dodge, who afterward became United
States Senator from lowa, was then but a
boy, scarcely able to carry a gun, yet he
insisted on joining the expedition. So
persistent was be in his demands that he
be allowed to go with the compnny that
his father finally found a small shotgun
for him, and, banding it to his son, said.
"Shoot well, my boy." The boy obeyed
his father's injunction and fought va
liantly throughout the struggle that fol
lowed.
The leaders of the murderouk Winne
bagos were captured and a season of peace
followed. Then Henry Dodge and the
settlers who had ventured into the wild
country with them turned their attention
to more peaceful pursuits. Toe business
ways that men do they yet have much to
answer for at the bar of public opinion.
For instance, there are hundreds of fond
mothers who, with smiling disregard of
the feelings, the comfort or the rights of
others, allow their "jewels" to â no mat

of mining and smelting was taken up and
carried on success ully.
But this condition of things had not
come about before tiie women and chil
dren in the little stockade had been suL<
jected to many days and nights of terror.
The prairies were covered with the red
skins and they afterward threatened the
stockade and the lives of those intrenched
behind its walls. Unscrupulous white
men would sell whisky to non-combatant
Indians, who hung about the settlements,
and they would become obstreperous and
threaten the lives of the whites. But the
little garrison left to protect the women
and children and composed largely of
negroes succeeded in keeping the savages
at bay.
The Territory had not then been ceded
to the United States and, being in an In

"Father would make frequeut present*
to the chiefs," said Mrs. Truett, "in tbe
hope of preserving peace. He would give
them barrels of flour aud pork, when flour
was worth fl2 a barrel and pork $30, but
at times the Indians would beconiÃ bad.
I remember oue time when a warrior, a
tremendous fellow, over six feet tali, came
to tbe house and made resolute demands.
Father told him to go away, but the In
dian became more persistent and insolent,
and father knocked him down with a
three-legged stool. Father lost his tem
per and was about to kill the Indian, but
my brother interfered and prevented this,
and it is well that he did so, for if the
savage bad been killed the men of his
tribe would have massacred our whole
family."
One cold day a number of Indians went
to the Dodge home and demanded food
A trying thing which many women do
in public gatherings, all unconscious, it
seems, of its effect upon their victims, is
to put their feet upon a rung of the chair
in which another person is seated. If that
person happens to be a nervous, delicately
organiz?d man or woman such an inflic
tion is nothins short of absolute torture.
A lady who attended a meeting of a very
"swagger" club not long since went home
suffering agonies and went to bed, having
been made actually ill because a woman
who sat behind her had made a footstool
and drink. They told General Dodge to
leave the place or they would kill him.
When matters became critical young
Augustus Dodge seized a sword and
thrusting it against, the throat of the
leader ot the band of savages threatened
to kill him unless he and his followers left
tbe house. The Indians left and their
leader after them.
There were many similar scenes through
which Mrs. Truett passed during those
alarming days of her girlhood.
Upon ihe breaking out of the Black Hawk
war, in 1832, his father was a colonel in
the Michigan territorial militia. On the
Bth of May of that year this intrepid pio
neer, at the head of a small band of his
neighbors and accompanied by his sons,
Henry and Augustus, started on a perilous
journey toward the Rock River. They
had not gone far when Colonel Dodge re
ceived a message by runner notifying him
that the people of Dodgeville and of all
tbe country in the immediate vicinity
were in immediate danger from the
Indians. Colonel Dodge and his com
mand hurried back to Dodgeville and im
mediately began to erect additional stock
ade forts and to organize for defense.
He established his headquarters at Fort
Union, near bis home at Dodgeville.
Then followed ihe outbreak, and for two
months tbe fiendish savaees reveled in a
carnival of blood. Old men and women
and children, as well as the young and
strong of the whites, were cruelly butch
ered. Every schoolchild has read that
dark chapter in the history of the early
settlement of the \Vest. The Indians
killed their victims in the most brutal
manner and often ate their flesh and
drrnk their blood. Mrs. Truettwas in the
midst of it all at Dodgeville, and although
she was but a young girl the scenes
she witnessed then made such a terriDly
vivid impression upon her mind that she
now recalls them with horror as she sits,
so many years later, in her quiet home in
California, far removed from that bloody
battle-ground of the early pioneer days.
Young Augustus was made a lieutenant
of volunteers for home protection, and
with a small bedy of valiant men guarded
the women and children in the stockades
from bands of prowling Indians. And
Christiana Dodge, wife of General Henry
Dodge and mother of Mrs. TruÂ»stt, with
her daughters, stayed in the fort and
cooked for the soldiers. Mrs. Truett is
very proud of her mother's courage, and
from all accounts of those troublous times
she has cause to be.
Mrs. Truett recalls the battle of Bad Axe
and all the stirring incidents of the cam
paign, including the final capture of Black
Hawk, and although her memory is some
what dimmed by the flight of years, she
yet talks interestingly of them.
After Black Hawk was conquered Gen
eral Dodge again interested himself in
mining and the family home remained at
Dodgeville. About this time Jeff Davis,
then a young lieutenant of dragoons, wa3
stationed at a post near Dodgeville, and
he, with other officers of the garrison, be
came frequent visitors at the Dodge home.
In connection with these visits Mrs.
Truett tells a little bit of unwritten his
tory which, had its tinale been otherwise,
might have changed the course of the Civil
war. It appears from her narrative that
Jeff Davis, the young subaltern, became
very attentive to Mrs. Truett's older sister,
Mary, and whenever he visited the Dodge
home showed a decided preference for Miss
Mary's company, and the two would take
lon -^ walks across the sun-kissed dairies
of the lower part of her chair during the
entire session.
This infringement upon the rights of
others is common everywhere, but queerly
enough a person who summons up suffi
cient courage to manifest any annoy
ance or resentment under the circum
stances is looked upon by the offender as
a vary unamiable and unaccommodating
individual indeed, and any meek protest
from him or her caused by the racking
wretchedness of the situation is received
with a cold ana lofty hauteur which i 3
crushing in the extreme.
Women are quite as exasperatingly
prone as men to attempt to reverse tho
"rule of the road" and turn to the left on
our crowded sidewalks, and they look
quite as ridiculous in the ' chassez ng"
tnat invariably ensues.
There are women also who make a fad
of perfuming their belonging until their
personal presence is ainiost suffocating in
crowded cars or places of amusement, the
sweet but heavy scents actually poisoning
the air in their vicinity.
Worst of all pure y feminine nuisances
is, however, the omnipresent woman with
hatpins so long that three or four incites
of each one she wears protrude from her
head-covering, the needlelike points
threatening dire disaster to all who ap
proach her.
A vivacious female with her head thus
decorated and defended is always sure of
room enough in a crowd, for she is an
object of positive terror to every one in
her immediate vicinity, and those nearesc
her will tumble over each other in the
effort to get oat of her way whenever
a movement of her neck turis the busi
ness ends of her flittering and moat effec
tive weapons in their direction.
There is another form of nuisance, for
which both sexes are equally 10 biame,
that is frequently met with in museums,
Dicture galleries and similar places of
public resort, and that is the couple, gen
erally young, who meet there for the pur
pose o! quarreling, "makiue up,' 1 or aim
piy "spooning."
These parlies usually pre-empt a posi
tion near some object of special interest
and remain there absorbed in the business
in hand, only noticing those around them
sufficiently to manifest decided hosiility
whenever any one dares approach the in
visible "dead line" with which they have
apparently surrounded themselves.
In their estimation the persom who,
moved by a desire to view the exhibits in
heir vicinity, have the temerity to come
tanywhere neai them, are simnly disagree
able specimens of the Paul Pry genu-, and
well deserve the contemptuous glances
and sotto voce sarcastic comments on the
vulgarity and general otfensiveness of
"eavesdropping" that fall to their lot.
In the estimation of the parties frowned
upon, however, who are conscious of the
rectitude of their motives, and, having no
possible interest in the affairs of the two,
decidedly object to the hindrance and an
noyance of their stationary presence and
their unpleasing imputations, such
couples are nuisances indet-d.

1 together and gather great bnnche3 of wi!d
flowers. But young Davis was called away
to another post, and when he returned to
Dodgeville eight years later and formally
asked for the hand of Miss Mary in mar
riage he was refused, for another had be?n
more constant in his wooing. And then
and there another pace of history was
written.
After comparative peace came to that
erstwhile bloody section, Selina Dodte
was sent to a convent in Illinois, and
there she was educated. After leaving
the convent she was married to Myers P.
Truett.wfco served during the Black Hawk
War and who died in Mexico eight years
ago. She came to California with her hus
band in the '50,'s, undergoing all the hard
ships of travel across the continent in
those early days. Her husband became
one of the Vigilantes, and was well known
in California at the time of his death. His
was also a most remarkable life, fraught
with striving and dangers, in many of
which his intrepid wife shared.
After the Black Hawk war honors
crowded fast upon Mrs. Trueti's father,
Henry Dodge, and his brother Adolphus.
In 1834 President Andrew Jackson ap
pointed Henry Dodge colonel of the
United States Dragoons, and in the same
year he conducted a campaign against the
Comanche and Kiowa Indians in the
Southwest, and in 1835 was the leader of
an expedition to the Rocky Mountains.
When the Territory of Wisconsin was or
ganized in 1536 he was appointed the
Governor. In 1838 Augustus Dodge was
appointed Reeister of the Land Otlice at
Burlington, lowa. In 1840 he was elected
a delegate to Congress, and in the same
year his father was elected delegate to
Congress from the Territory of Wisconsin,
and father and son took seats together in
the National House of Representatives â
the first and only instance of the kind in
the history of the Government. Father
and son served in the House with distinc
tion. Augustus Dodge was particularly
active in advancing the settlement of
Oregon.
In 1848 the latter was elected one of the
first two United States Senators from
lowa, and as seven years before the son
had welcomed the father to his seat in the
House of Representatives the son in
turn was now welcomed to hi? place in
the Senate by his father, who nad been
elected to the upper house a few mnnihs
previous. They served together as Sena
tors until 1855. The presence of fathsr
and son in the Senate as members at iha
same time is without precedent. In 1855
Augustus Dodge was appointed Minister
to Spain, and served in that capacity at
Madrid for four years. All through their
lives father and son served their country
with distinction.
Hon. W. W. Dodge, present State Sen
ator of lowa, is a son of Adolphus Dolge
and a nephew of Mrs. Truett. He was
I unaware of the fact that hia aunt was still
alive until last November. He thought
she was dead, and the fact that she still
lived and resided in San Francisco was
unknown to him. That he should remain
in Ignorance of his aunt's existence is not
a matter for wonder, as she is very retir
ing in her disposition ana sin%e her hus
band's death eight years ago she has more
than ever desired seclusion.
And as one sits and looks upon the calm
face of this aged lady whose childhood
eves witnessed such scenes of blood and
carnage as have been recounted, he is not
surprised that as she approaches the
threshold of eternity she turns to the
book in which it is written: "I shall lead
you forth beside the waters of comfort,"
and wherein it is said: "All thy ways are
pleasantness ami thy paths are peace."

When Should a Doubtful TricU Be
Trumped ?
The idea we entertain about Irumping a
doubtful trick is in some respects different
from the-textbooks. A few weeks ago we re
sponded to an invitation from the Lomitas
Whist Club oi Petaluma to give them a little
whist talk, and we took, for our subject
"Whist Not Found in the Textbooks." One of
the various points we touched upon was
when to trump and when not to trump a
doubtful trick on the firs', or second round of ;
the suit. We asked the members oi the club ,
to try our way. The following different situa- j
tious about cover tiie entire ground:
Firstâ Having a wenk hand including ex
treme veukness in trump?â trump the trick.
Secondâ Having Rreat strengih in trumps,
six or more strong enough in trump ana lead
a trumpâ trump the trick.
Thirdâ Having strength in trumps (meaning
by strength three high ones, such as ace, king
and one other; ace, queen and one other; king,
queen and one other; queen, jack, ten, etc., or
four of any size) and also holding one plain
suit in your hand, establisl.ed or worth trying
to establisn, pass tho trick, and your partner
is hsked to draw this inference and govern
himself accordingly. With many players,
when their partner passes a doubtful trick
they always put them up for at least four
trumps. This is radically wrong. Another
disastrous thing many partners do is, when
you tate n force by trumping a sure trick and
because you don't immediately lead a trump,
they will olten go out of their way to compel
you to trump again, generally smashing your
hand, as well as their own, all to pieces.
Fourth â No matter how many tramps you
hold and have extreme weakness in plain
suitsâ that is, absolutely nothingâ trump the
first or second round. By the third round you
Bhould be able to mark the winning card, and
if not led the probabilities are that it is in
your partner's hand, and you would not trump
of course. We have often heard it stated that
if one player has no long, plain suit, but has
four or five trumps, it is two to one that
his partner has one long suit worth trying to
establish and would advise passing a doubtful
trick, with the hope oi getting out trumps for
that imaginary suit in partntr's hand. We do
not think this is sound. It is ouly one chance
in three, one way of figuring.
Fifthâ Passing a sure trick is a peremptory
demand or call for a trump lead, and the
player so passing says, Partner, I will take
two or more tricks for the one I let go if you
will assist, me a little by leading trumps at
once, and if you lead through an honor lead
your highest regardless of number. We would
advise you to rtad a copy of "Tbc Art ol Trac

Question of the Proper Discard.
We clip the following from the Philadelphia
Evening Telegraph of January 13:
The appended deal, which appeared in the
Brooklyn Kagle of Monday Immt, was recently
played at the Brooklyn Whist Club, n shows the
value of a uniform discard frum â rrTTIHM. no
matter which side leads trumps The old English
book-writer's play of discarding from strength on
the adversaries' lead of trumps has long been
abandoned In this country, and is now generally
regarded as a trick-loser by the experts of the day.
Such statements as the above are mislead
ing and should not appear in a piper catering
to the whist-players of this country. (We
mean by catering, asking the whist clubs and
whist readers to subscribe for it.) The whist
editor of the Telegraph should explain what
he means by "the old Kngiish book-writers,"
Does he mean Pole? We think not. Does he
mean Cavendish? Does ho mean Edmond
Hoyle? We give it up. And, again, he says:
'â¢Discarding from strength on the adversaries'
lead of trumps has long been abandoned In
this country."
If "in this country" means part of Phila
delphia, we will admit it; but if "in this coun
try" means the United States, the Telegraph
is away off. Our individual ideas of the dis
card, wo know, are not far irorn the individual
ideas of the Telegraph whist editor, but to
make such a broad statement as the above
without any qualification whatever Is, to put it
well, misleading. We recommend our readers
to carefully study the Drayson system of dis
carding, which, in the writer's opinion, is the
best system in use at the present time, and also
to carefully read over Fisher Ames" idea of the
discard recently published in The Call.

The whist don'ts published in these columns
n few months ago and rt-cently published in
booklet form.for/recdis'.rlbution only, were not
copyrighted for the simple reason we do not

have had for them from all parts of the United
States, Canada, and evenjacross the Atlantic,
shows that we have at least excited the cari

Mr. and Mrs. Miller celebrated their silver
wedding anniversary last Sunday afternoon

magnificently decorated with violets, roses

Qrand-Stand Whist-Flayers.
Milton C. Work, Whist Editor of the Evening
Telegraph, after publishing a deal trom the St.
Paul Globe, says:
Mr. Bunn also cllds an article from the Brook
lyn Kagle and comments on it as folows:
"The allusion to the couper refers to G. A. La
Vie, who is known in the whist world as the
Brooklyn Couper by reason of bii propensity f->r
malting grand-stand plays. It is a curious fact
that while all of Mr. La Vle's coops which are
published have been sound and successful, yet the
Brooklyn Whist Club records do not show his
score to bÂ» near the top. The inference naturally
Is that some coups have not worked, it is uuior
tiiDtitP tliut these remain unpublished, for Mr. La
Vie'Â« apparently uniform success will ba:d y tend
to discourage a large class of moderate whist
players who are watching for a coup in every
hand, and frequently find one that Is not there.
I We should like nothing softer than a challenge
j trophy match against a team of four coupers."
We desire to most heartily concur in Mr. Bunn'g
I opinion. His Dot the couper who wins the most
j tricks in the long run. A coup comes alone possi
bly once in a couple of hundred deals on an aver-
I ase. The player who picks up each deal looking
i for a coup cenerally gets a score ihÂ»t increases the
I plus of the others playing his way. It is steady,
conservallvo play that wins. The man who rarely
loses a coM trie* is the man who ends the season
with tue top score.
Short Suit Whist by Val W. Starnes.
A recent and one of the most valuable con
tributions to the whist literature of tha day is
"Short Suit Whist," by Val W. Starnes, pub
lished by tSrentano's. It starts out with" the
following text:
"Individually, every card is more valuable when
led up to than when led." Mr. starnes uses as a
basis for his game the old English leads and rejects
the number showing plays of the American leads.
A. radical short suiter would claim that iir.
quence and wit Later the jolly throng re
turned to the parlors and resumed their gay
festivities, whicu sped the hours until mid

<eived.

draperies.
The bride of a year was attired in white silk

in always opening from their longault and desire
to know when to open from a short suit and what
shore suits are b*st to lead, this work will be es
pecially interesting.
Whistlets.
A member of the Trist Duplicate Whist Club
of this City has got up a celluloid score-sheet
and also a celluloid trump-record card. The
advantage they have over the ordinary kind
in use is that they can be used indefinitely.
The whist editor of The Call reached Al
bany, N. V., just in time to see the challenge
match between the Columbia Athletic Whist
Club of Washington and the Albany Cub of
Albany for the A. W. L. trophy. The match

"Do you think they will get along nicely
when they are married?"
"I am sure of it. I took care to find out
shortly after they were engaged."
"How?'
"I gave several whist parties and "arranged

quarreled once."
Under the rules governing play for the Ride
out trophy a drawing was had on Tuesday

more space in our newspapers than all the
other indoor games put together. Ii has a

PERSONALS.
Dr. Clarence L. Deller leaves for San Fran
cisco on February 25 for Europe, where he in
by that brilliant writer and whist authority,
Cassius M. Paine. ThÂ» strides ttiat have been
made In the past few years among the whist
laity is something to bÂ» admired. The good
work that is done in the da ly papers on the
subject of whist is not generally appreciated
lor the reason the hardest workers in the
field labor for glory. Could the Brooklyn
Eagle purchase one article on whist from Rob
ert H. Weems, he who has done so much for
the noble game through the columns of that
paper and innumerable other ways ? Mr.
Weems has never written a line for pay and
never wouid.
What has Milton C. Work done in the Even
ing Telegraph of Philadelphia? It is simply
phenomenalâ a daily whist column, with news
from all parts of the whist world, and nearly
a whole page every Saturday. And St Paul
says, in the letters and writings of Ueorge L.
Bunn in the St. Paul Sunday Globa, so many
good things that we delight in republishing
them. John H. Brigjjs, no doubt one of the
greatest whist-players living, is the whist
editor of the Minneapolis Times. And Chi
cagoâthere is no city in the Union that has
done so mucn to spread whist as tne great city
by .he lake. The Chicago Times-Herald and
Inter Ocean come out every Sunday with
interesting articles trom the peu of John T
Mitchell, the father of duplicate whist and
one of the beat expert players in this country.
What would the New York Sunday Sun be
without its articles on whist from the pen of
R. F. Foster, the great whist author and ad.
vocate of Bhort-suttism? Mr. Foster is one of
the best posted men in America on the subject
of whist. His heart is in the right place, if his
pen is not always. T. E. Ois, whist editor of
the Newark (New Jersey) News, says many a
brilliant and instructive thing thac touches
the spot The Post-Express of Rochester. N. V.,
hat W. H. Samson as editor, ably assisted by
R. F. Foster.
The Public Ledger of Philadelphia started a
whist column about a year ago to the great
surprise of the whoie country. The staid old
journal had to come to it and is ably edited
by Warren A. Hawley. The New York Times
has fallen into Hue, with Johu H. Stevenson,
retired United States Naval Officer, at the
helm. The Boston Herald has E. C. Howell.
Charles E. Coffin, author of "Gist of Whist,"
has devoted a year of his time for whistâ for
loveâ in an Indianapolis paper. The Even
ing Journal of Albany, N. V., has come iato
the whist fold. Wheelock's Weekly of Fergus
Falls comes to us once a week with many good
snappy whist articles. Tne only section of
the country that seems to overlook their thou
sands of wnist readers is this coastâ ouiside

IN CALIFORNIA
"â "â ^IIE College of Mines of the State Uni
â  4\^ versity at Berkeley does not attract
â¢^l(>X current attention in the practl

best ono in America, and it is another
* interesting fact that there is an as
sured prospect that it will soon un
dergo an awakening and an expansion
that will make it the great mining school of
the world. This branch of the university
promises to be one of the first to partake of the
â¢ development which is in prospect through the
? princely donations which are promised and
through the increased appropriation which
the present Legislature seems certain to freely

people of wealth have promised gifts for
special purposes aggregating over $4,000,

. buildings and equipments which will make
.it the greatest and most famous mining school
â¢ in the world. The College of Mines is now
going quietly and efficiently along, turning
out an increasing number of young men
Equipped with the scientific and technical

are more and more applied to mining. With its

Mil es as it is, however â 9s handicapped a* :t
. is for room Rnd money. As a result oi the
>', of Interest in mining the number
oi students enrolled for the mining course
this year is nearly double what it was last
year or any year in its history. Last year there
wer<j sixty students and this year there is 110.
As the college oi Mines is an integral part of
the university and not a merely affiliated in
stitution, with an entirely indepenaent
faculty, like the coUeges of medicine,
law end dentistry, it possesses at
once an advantage which could never
be gained by un independent institution.
Physics, chemistry, mathematics and
geoiogy are the foundation of the rcinine
course, and the students in mining pursue
these studies i a common with all other stu
dents of the university. The buildings, iabor
. atcrivs. etc., which afford facilities lor these
studies could not be supplied for .$1,000,000.
The "department of geology under Professor La
Contc is famous for its work and its men, and
Its museum comprises many thousands oi
specimens. The new and magnificently
equipped chemistry building and the separate
1 A - : 'gs and equipments for the depaitments
oW" . hacical and electrical engineering are
â¢ also thai parts of the College of Mines.
The college has separate buildings of its
own which are rather extensive, but still in
adequate. A large tnree-story brick building
and a frame building, in whicn is a small but
â¢complete mill for gold and silver ores, are de
.voted exclusively to instruction in mining
and metallurgy. This department Is presided
ever by Professors. Jl. Christy, who has held
the chair of mining and meuuiurgy for many
years.
Professor Christy has gained his;h rank as a
metallurgist, ana his recent researches in con
nection with the cyanide process have at
tracted widespread attention among miners
ond metallurgists. The equipment of this
department is especially adapted to the ctudy
of the ores of gold and .'â ilver, and this
specialty, which is a proper one on the Pacific
. 'Mstingni'hes this school from all other
1 ' tiihr ones in tne world. Among the import-
Ri'.t leatuies of the equipment for the special
o! mining is the assay laboratory oc-
Dg six rooms, and a retearch leboratory
01 four rooms, well supplied with furnices for
Â»1 tests of ores, a crushing and sampling
tot i (host for the sharpening and tempering
of tools, and in a separate building a complete
ipplied with an ore-crusher, thrue-Mamp
battery, concentrator and a great variety
of other machinery. The laboratories
and shops ara well equipped with elec
trical, chemical, physical and mechani
cal accessories, and several thousand
lantern slides and a stereopticon in the lec
ture-room illusirate every phase of mining nil
over the world. Ores of all kinds and grades
arÂ«vir"uly supplied by mine-owners from all
ovcÂ« lac coast. About one-half a student's
tiff^ is spent in tUo laboratory, mi!l or other
practical work, and one of tne first things a
student learns is how to drill holes in the big
granite blocks set behind the main building,
using first Hand drills and sledges and then
different sorts of machine drills. From this
the student advances to the higher prob
lems of milling engineering. Each vacation
the students, with few exceptions, spend the
whole time at actual work in some oi the big
mines working In various ways like the mm
ers there and being paid whatever tliey are
worth. Last summer six worked in the Treaa
weil mine in Alaska and others in the Utica
and otner California mines. Some work this
way to help themselves through tho course
and come back and live on $10 a mo'ith, but
Professor Christy urges this bummer work on
all the students as an important feature of
their mining education. He believes that
every mining superintendent should know
just how it govs to sweat all day and have
aching bones at the end of the shift.
OurCollegeof Mineshassentforthia the past

some are among the best known mining ex

by the greater numbars who are talcing brief

summer. It is not from amoa^ these, how
ever, that the capital of the future will sum
mon skii! where skill and exact scientific
i knowledge are of vital importance.
'Mining isa thing in which a little learning
is a dangerous thing to one's self and friends,"
said Professor Christy the other day. "It is a
difficult business and one of the hardest
courses in tne university, for it requires edu
cation on so many sides. Our graduates are
thoroughly grounded in the sciences in which
mining depends, but a graduate should spend
four or five years in a tubordiuate position in
a mine before assuming aa executive position.
We are not trying to turn out mining experts.
"I don't believe much in mining experts.
The business is overdone. Nothing but long
experience and a good education will make an
expert, and I don't think that any man under
40 has a right to pose as a min
ing expert. Young men should not

J^lacroscopical Examination.
BY MELVILLE ATTWOOD.
Tl.e "Macrcscopic il" examination of the
wall rocks of different metalliferous fissures
and the ores or lode matters In them is of the
greatest importance to the miner. For in-
I stance, by simply grinding and polishing
some of the rich ores of tho
taken at the surface of the Ophir mine nnd
down at the 1750 level of tho Consolidated
Virginiaâ the large proportion of the eiec
trum, or native alloy oÂ£ gold and silver, can
there be plainly seen by the naked eye. When
extrecting the ore the rich portion of it should
have been carefully selected and tl. â¢ ore as
sorted, the assorting being done after the fol
lowing mode: Tho ore should have been
passed through crushers set a few inches
apart, ana from them into a ciruuiar revolv
ing wire screen .some feet long, having holes
of ha;f an inch. A stream of water should be
made to pass through the top of the screen,
and the slope or angle of which made to
suit the character of the ore ia be treated.
From the screen, when well washed, the ore
should be delivered to a round rev->. vir.g as
sorting taale, where, with a piece cf fcoopiron,
the a-sortin? by hand is done. The C'omstock
assorted ore would then have been worth
many thousands of dollars a ton by smelting.
The nincrcscopiea! examination of recks is
the mere inspection of the outer surface
viewed as an opaque object, yet If the examin
ation is properly conducted it will, 1 think,
afford all the necessary information required
Dy the miner to enable him roughly to dis
tinguish the character of the rock, especially
if the rock should be of a coarse texture.
la the macrcrscopical investigation of rocks
these parts of the mineral constituents dis
cernible by the naked eye, or by the aid of a
common magnifier, can be easily studied,
with reference to crystalline form, cleavage!
color, luster, hardness, solubility in acids',
DiHgnetic properties, etc.
The specimen of rock selected for examina
tion should have a go&d fresh surface of frac
â ure and be free fiom decomposition; size,
about 3 or 4 inches across and 1Â«Â£ inciies
through; with a trimming hammer prepare
the 134-Inch surface, or dress it as even as pos
sible; then procure an iron p'.ate with a
smooth face, about 10 inches square and one
haif inch thick, on which put emery powdor
No. 80 and water; rub the prepared face of the
specimen upon it till it is smooth enough to
polish. This can be done by getting a piece of
thick glass about the same size as the iron
plate, on which put fine emery and water, and
ap;nm rub tbe specimen till you obtain a flue
polish.
When polished, heat the specimen on a
Move so that you can Darely handle ii, and
when in that condition rub Canada balsam
over one-naif of the polished surface. When
cold it will harden so that it can be handled
without injury. A small fragment may be
broken from the unpolished end to try its
specific gravity, magnetic properties, and also
for acid tests. The following implements will
be found sufficient for this simple mode of in
vestigation:
Firstâ A common magnifier, mounted in
horn, that being lighter than metal. It should
have three powers aud be set in a spectacle
frame with screens, so that the different
powers can be easily changed.
Secondâ A small bar magnet, and also a
magnetic needle freely suspended or sup
ported.
Thirdâ A small unglazed porcelain streak
plate.
Fourthâ A bottle of hjrochloric acid with a
fine glass rod attached to the stopper.
Fifthâ A dressing hammer with the head
about three inches long; one end with a lace
half an inch square and the other chisel
shaped.
Sixthâ A pocket micrometer, same as m ade
by A. Sletz.
Seventhâ A piece o; fist iron ten inches
square and half an inch thick.
Eighthâ A piece of thick glass, ten Inches
square, and a few pounds of coarse and fine
emery.
Ninthâ Scale of hardness.
After many trials I found the best ana
easiest mode of determining the hardness
was to have the minerals forming the scale of
hardness mounted something like a writing
diamond. Ureas, for instance, the corundum,
topaz, etc., into fragments, una after select
ing those with fine, sharp points prcceea to
mount them in the following mtaner:
Take a small rubber pencil and extract the
rubber from the end of it. Then with a small
spirit lamp melt some Inpidary's cement into
the vacant space; with a small pair of pliers
take the (raiments of minerals, heat one end
of them and insert it into tne cement in the
enl of the pencil wnile the cement is warm:
by weuing your finger you can mold it into
any shape you please, and when cold, if
properly done, it hardens and answers just as
well as if set iv metal, with the advantage
that you can renew it ai any nme in a iew
moments.
In addition to the implements named Â».
smaii collection ot" the commoner types of for
eign rock should be procured and prepared
with polished sides after the manner before
described.
Tlk' specimens of igneous roekihould consist
of era. lite, syenite, diorite, gubbro diabase,
dolerite and basalt, and of small bottles with
fragments of me different feldspars showing
character and cletivage: orthocla.se (potash
feldspnr), albite (soda), auonhlte (lime), labra
dorite (isme soda); al*o small pieces of horn
blende and augite. Thetriclinic teldspar may
be distinguished from monociinic, c. g., oiigo
clase or labradorite from ortboclase by the
presence of fine parallel htriaj along the surface
of certain of the cleavage plane*. Hornblende
crystals bave generally a fibrous structure,
by which they may ofteu be recognized from
augite crystals. In the following table by
Professor Bonney igneous rocks are classified
primarily according to their mineralogical
composition, and secondarily according to
their intimate structure.

It will also be necessary to have a few speci
mens of metumcrphio, crystalline schists,
sedimentary and fragmental rocks.
Witb the small collection of the already
named characteristic rocks for comparison,
the rough determination of hand specimens of
the inclosing rocks may easily be arrived at.
The coating of Canada bulssra shows the
structure and crystalline character much
better than the ordinarily po'.i?hedlÂ»urfnce, so
th<U the tests for hardness, etc., should be ap
plied only to the polished surface.
By tinving the lenses Â«c* in spectacle frames
both hands ore at liberty, one to hold the rock,
the other to use the scale of hardness, or to ap
ply the fine glass rod dipped in acid to try if
any of the component pans of the specimen
effervesce.
These tests for comparison can be applied to
those types in the collection which resemble
the one being tested.
The magnetic properties can be tested with
a freely suspended magnetic needle, or by
breaking a portion of the rock into small
fragments, washing It in a batea, and then
applying the bar magnet to the heavier parti
cles. .
The size of the crystals may be measured
into a pocket micrometer.
1 do not remember to have seen or read of
the macroscopic inspection of rocks being
made by cutting large slices and polishing
their faces, but whether it has been done be
fore or not is not of much importance. One
thing is certainâ that No. 2 specimen (photo
graphed), taken from the hanging wall against
the richest part of the shoot in the Eureka
mine, Grass Valley, could not be well deter
mined in any other way, whether by chemical
analysis or by microscopic sections. There
fore the macroscopical examination of rocks is
strongly to be recommended to all miners and
prospectors as of the highest importance.

Miss Nellie Binckley, the artist, of this

ber attention to etching with tire and to
leather carving, especially the former.
Leather carving is dono very little in this
country. A Chicago paper a short time

there were no carvers in leather in the
United States, except two ladios in Cali

Miss Binckley's studio on Sutter street
shows a large amount of etchings by fire.
The etchings are chiefly on wood ana
leather. She says that really the original
etchings here were done by the Indians,
as may be seen by an examination of the
inner sides of the bearskin?, elkskins
and hides ot other animals on which they
have drawn curious Indian figures with
fire. The burning lines are traced by the
pointed piece of sjeel known Â»s a cautery,
which is kept red hot by the generation of
hydrocarbon vapor in a small bottle.
"California furnishes a most attractive
field tor a line etcher or professional, for
there is such a fascinating variety of beau
tiiiu woods to choose from. Tho u e most
used are poplar, sycamore, white holly,
redwood and niadrone. The latter has a
tone admirable as a suggestion of flesh
tint and is excellent for heads," said the
lady yesterday.
'Leather is as much adapted for this
decoration as wood and is almost as dur
able. A new leather has been prepared
by a special process for tir! etching. It is
called velvet calf and has an exquisite
velvety surlace, somethii.g like suede or
undressed kid, and is soft and pliable. It
is dyed in a variety of colors, usually
gray, '.erra cotta and green. Sheepskin is
tanneu with the same velvety finish now
and is much less expensive than the calf.
"Then there is leather carving. This
has been done a great deal in Germany,
bnt it is ronsidtred more distinctively
Mexican. It is entirely different from the
old Spanish and German stamped leather
and is literally carved with suarp tooh.
A Mexican has recently begun doing this
work .n Ciiicago and O'Hara & Livermore
intend to introduce it here.
"In the older llexican towns dark-eyed
artisans worn still at the leather, won
drously cut and carved, ar.d known to
all the world as a remnant of the days
when every man was a cavalier, and his
saddle the prondest of his possessions.
â¢'Now comes the etching of the leather,
technically called pirogravure, growing
under the hands that is dominant to
day â the race oi new women. As to my
own work in fine etching, my specialty is
heads ana figures. It bores me to extinc
tion to do conventional designs. I hate
to do anything which has to be exactly
the same on each side. It is purely me
chanical. Any one can doit. It only re
quires care. It is no particular credit jo
get it perfect and it is disgraceful to get it
wrone.
"But to do a figure design well ia some
thing ;hat interests one more, and is to a
ereat or less extent an achievement. One
must feel it enter into tbe spirit of the
design or it will be stiff and wooden. It
takes a sure eye and a steady hand, and a
sufficient Knowledge of anatomy (in ligure
work), to give the worker the power of
assimilating the designs, and putting it
forth aeain from his own brain without
the necessity lor constant reference to the
design.
"When one makes a long, flowing line,
it is disastrous to glance aside at the
copy. An instant's pause :n the progress
of your red hot point and a hole, or at
least a period, appears, and the line is
spoiled."
Among the etchings which Miss B'nck
ley has is one of Cypress Point, near Mon
terey, with a view of the sea; figures of
Indians and Chinese and of bears and
other wild nnirnals.

THE! CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL,
SUNDAY FEBRUARY 14,1897
THE FAKE AND THE FACT.
â THE FAKE!
The Examiner published for several days at the
top of its title page th.- fallowing fa^e:
THE EXAMINER PUELISHED
249,757 Inches
Of Ads During JS96.
5964 More
Than were published by any
other San Francisco newspaper.
In the publication of this fake the Examiner
was probably not aware that a careful record was
bÂ»lrg kept of the actual amount in inch' of Its
advertising and that in consequence it could be
confronted with the following fact.
T^E PACT
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
236,528 Inches
Of Ads During J896.
That is one fact and here is an-
other:
THE CALL PUBLISHED
239,551 Inches
Of Ads During 1896.
3,023 More
Inches were published in
THE CALL than in the
Examiner during J896.
It Is to be remembered that during 1896 th*
Examiner published approximately 800 inches of
Illegal lottery advertisements, of walch Tim Call
did not and would not {hibllsh one.
Ihe monarch of the f oxers- has doubtless suc-
ceeded in securing thousands of inches of adver-
tising during the past year by dup n â¢ and deceiv.
ing advertisers through false acd arrogant asser-
tions of the Character of the foregoing lake. It
would seem, however, from the facts that the
merchants as a rule have not been misled by its
fraudulent pretenses.
The Examiner boasts that Its books are open to
inspection, but we suggest that it Inspect Its own
looks before it venture) uoon the publication of
another fake.
We congratulate the public on the fact that the
rxrosure of this fake led the Examiner to drop it.
. In this the Examiner was discreet, and if it l-i wise
li will make no more such bold attempts to
deceive the public.

The Stanford mansion will give a su

Alto and serve to b: ing it into closer rela

relations benefits will flow both to the
university atnl to the city, and there ij
reason, therefore, for a general congratu
lation on this new evidence of Mrs. Stan
ford's munificent regard for the public
welfare.
Since San Francisco is to have a farm
ers' club,- efforts should be made to de
velop it into an organization large and
vigorous enough to attract the attention
of the State. It is time the people of the
interior were impressed with the truth
thai residents of San Francisco, so far
from being indifferent to rural industries,
are themselves engaged in such indus
tries on a large scale.
THE SOBER SECOND THOUGHT.
The people of the United States gave to the Torld an objÂ«ct lesson in conser
vatism in the last National election. Believing that the selected standard-bearers of
the Democratic party represented an element in society which was hostile to what is
commonly understood as the rights of property, and that the triumph of Bryanlsm
meant a disturbance if not an invasion of those rights, every citizen who had an in
vestment, large or smail, voted the Republican ticket and easily elected its National
nominees. In every community the country over the land-owners, the shareholders
in banks, mills, railroad?, factories, orchards and other industries, the owners of cor
porate bonds, the depositors in savings banks and the members of building and loan
societies, all flocked to the Eepubl'can standard, fearing the consequences of a victory
for the men and principles of the Chicago convention.
There is a deeper philosophy in tde result of tl c late election than may have been
noted at the time. It is to be remembered that the year 1895 was one of the darkest
in our Nation's commercial history ; that contraction an I depression and want of
confidence clogged every channel of trade and that distress and distrust were abroad
in the land. In the very midst of these unhappy conditions a National campaign
came on and by the action of the St. Louis and of the Chicago conventions the people
of the country were brought face to face with two suggested remedies for hard times
and bidden to choose Detween them.
The Republican platform plainly stated that the road to prosperity lay in main
taining the stability of the Nation's finances, in preservine the rights of property
and in the guarantee of safety in its investments and certainty in its returns.
On the other hand, the Chicago platform recommended an untried system of
finance and more than hinted at a wide application of socialism to the conduct of
business enterprises and the regulation of their affairs. Against this latter theory
of how to banish depression the sober second thought of the American people set
itself strongly and recorded its verdict that business activity and prosperity can b a
maintained, or, if lost, can be restored, only by keeping faith with property, whether
represented in the investments of the rich or the saved-up earnings of the poor.
The State of California has had several severe lessons as to the folly of frighten
ine capital away from investment by ilUadvised assaults upon that already invested.
The cvi's which grew rapidly out of the sandlot episode in our State history are only
too well remembered by those who saw their property depreciated and their savings
loÂ«t in the stagnation of business, the failures of bank*, the delayod return of con
fidence and the tardy investment of capital which prevailed for several years
after 1879.
In common with tho rest of the country t'e people of California voted that they
desired prosperity nnd believed that the way to get it was to discourage that spirit of
disturbance, of distrust, of unrest and of hostility to the rights of property and the
assurance of its safe investment which dominated tho Chicago convention and was
the war cry of its nominees and of the newspapers which came to their support.
The merchants, the business men, the depositors in savings banks, the share
holders in buildinc and loan societies, the thrifty and frugal possessors of property
in California of whatever amount or form, know full well that nothing in the way
of enterprise, of productive activity, of commercial or industrial prosperity can
come from fomenting a spirit of antagonism and distrust among the people and
toward the various business energies which exist in their midst. The arts of the
demagogue and the methods of the anarchist should not be allowed to gain a
footing here nor to dominate in tne shaping of public opinion regarding any
question of either general or local concern.
TREE CUBA.
It is gratifying to note thp rapidity with
which popular sympathy with the Cuban
patriots is crystallizing into a form which
will render it effective und useful in bring
ing to a close the prolonged war in the
island. Puolic sentiment so long as it is
dispersed and scattered is of little value,
but when it results in organization it ac
quires a force which gives it a power to
accomplish whatever is aimed at.
The Call nas taken up the cause of
Cuba bpenuse it believes ihe time ha 9 now
come wnen earnest effort should be made
to put an end to the destruction of prop
erly and the useless waste of blood. It is
clear to everybody that Spain cannot re
establish hr Government over the Cuban
people, nor maintain there that peace
which is essential to prosperity. She can
not uphold anywhere beyond the limits
of the city of Havana even a pretense of
low, nor secure to the people either their
pruperty or their lives. Her pride wiil
not permit her to make peace, and so she
prolongs a useless struggle which is lap
ldly degenera:ing into mere crime.
The people of the United States had a
prompt sympathy with the Cuban patriots
as soon as they declared themselves for
independence and showed on the battle-
Geld a sufficient courage to maintain it.
They restrained themselves, however, from
any overt act against the Spanish Govern
ment, and for a long time upheld the con
servative policy of the Cleveland admin
istration in refusing to recognize the bel
ligerent rights of the pat.iotx.
It is everywhere recognized, however,
that the time has now come when a more
resolute and decided policy should be
adopted. There is no longer any question
of the ultimate triumpn of the Cuban
people. The only issues involved in the
contest are the length of time through
which the struggle may be prolonged and
the amount of property and number of
human lives which may be sacrificed dur
ing its continuance. This being so it is not
only the right but the duty of the United
States Government to intervene and put
an end to the pillage, plunder and mur
der which under the name of war are
being perpetrated in the island.
In appointing a committee to organize
popular sentiment in this City and direct
it to the object of puttinz an end. to the
contest we shall be following a course
which has been taken in over 700 other
cities of the Union. Our committee,
therefore, will not stand alone. It will
not have to resort to action whicji v.-ill be
weak because it is isolated. It will have
the advantage of co-operai ing with com
mittees in other cities, and will be part
and parcel of a movement embracing the
whole Union and having back of it tne
force of nearly the whole people.
The men who through The Call have
signified their willingness to nerve on the
committee are citizens of such eminence
and influence that the general mass of the
population will cordially follow and sup
port them in all that they undertane. The
outlook for the movement, therefore, is
most promising. We may count on it
that San Francisco will soon take her
place alongside her sister cities of the
Union, and through organized and well
directed fffort will give encouragement,
aid and help toward the establishment of
the independence of Cuba and the freeing
of another American people from Euro
pean domination.
Boston critics have had their attention
drawn to the fact that the foremost Amer
ican novels of the day have ail been writ
ten by working journalists: Stephen Crane,
Julian Hawthorne, Harold Frederic and
Harding Davis. They are now discussing
whether this means an elevation of jour
nalism or a degradation of literature, and
they are having a hign time over it.
The cruiser Vesuvius ran past the block
ading squadron of Admiral Bunco at
Charleston without trouble, so we can
now brag of the speed and skill of our
blockade runners. No warships can stop
them.
To celebrate Jackson's day the Demo
crats split into factions and held separate
banquets, but in celebrating Lincoln's
birth iay the Republicans trot together in
sentiment ai we.l a^ in' numbers. That is
the difference bwtwoen t.'ie parties.
If it be true a-t reported that Bryan was
recently offered a salary of $25,000 a year
as editorial writer and refused it, then it
is evident there is another man in this
country as bie a fool aÂ« Bryan himself.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY: 14, 1897.
THE GREEK FIREBRAND.
The determination of the Greeks to pro
tect the Cretans from Turkish misrule and
massacre brings Europe close to the verge
of a general war. When the battle is once
be. Un between the Turks and the Greeks,
it will be aim ost impossible to confine it
to those countries. The conditions have
'ong been such in the Levant that a war
bejjun anywhere is as likely to spread
throu.-hout the whole region as a fire
started by a match in a field of dry stub
ble would be likely to sweep it all before
it could be extinguished.
That the statesmen of Europe recognize
ihis fact is shown by their eagerness to
prevent tne Greeks from taking the action
on which they i:ave decided. It is re
ported that the Emperor of Austria ha 3
warned the Kine of Greece that if he goes
to war he will have to bÂ»ar the brunt
alone. It is also reported that the Czar of
Russia has notified the Cretans that they
must put an end to their inaurrections
against Turkish rule and ceaso to menace
the peace of Europe by their incessant
disturbances.
These warnings from Austria and Rus
sia signify a sense of alarm in the capitals
of botli countries. If either Austria or
Russia saw a way dear to avoid being in
volved in the contest, neither of them
would have been so prompt in their efforts
tojrevent it. The great powers of Europe,
inciudinK Austria and Russia, have been
trying for a year to devise a means of
kefipmÃ the peace in the Levant and pro
moting reforms in Turkey, and it is clear
that they see in the precipitation of Greece
a danger that all their plans will go to
pieces and that they will soon find them
selves forced into hostility with one
another and possibly into actual war.
It is not possible at this time to foretell
how the great nations will be divided if
the war should spread and become gen
eral. For some months past Great Britain,
France and Russia nave been in alliance on
the Turkish problem, and it is probable
that in case war came they would en
deavor to act on that alliance and take
the same side against any foes who might
arise. It is not likely, however, that the alli
ance would long continue. The interests of
England and Russia in Turkey are an
ta.omstic and so are the interests of Eng
land and France in Egypt. The conflict
of these interests would soon put an end
to any diplomatic harmony, and it is al
together likely that when the war actually
beean it would be found that France and
Russiawere on one side and Great Britain
with 3uch allies as she could obtain, on
the other.
One of the most serious complications
oi the Eastern question is found in the
fact that the antagonisms there are not
merely ho-tiliiies of race and commercial
interests, but of religion. The Christians
of Greece and Armenia aud of the Otto
man empire generally belong to ti.e
Greek church and are, therefore, co
religionists with the Russians and in hos
tility to the Roman Catholics of France
and Austria. These religious antago
nisms, which have little or no weight in
the Western world, are still matters of
profound importance in the East and will
have much to do with the final determin
ation of the Levantine problem. Alto
gether the subject is a moÂ«t complex and
confusing one and it is not to be wondered
at that European statesmen resort to every
means possible to avoid the impending
conflict.
COLLEGE MOEALS.
In the latest published reports of Har
vard College th?re is one from L. B. R.
Bri gs, Dean of the college, calling atten
tion to the serious matter of the existence
of a double standard of morals among the
students. It seems that to whatever ex
tent the siudents may be right or wrong
their conceptions of what is honest are
causing the faculty considerable embar
rassment in the management of tne uni
versity.
By one of the standards of morals recog
nlzrd at Harvard & liar, clearly known as
such, is despised and socially shunned,
but by the other the man who hands in as
his own wort what he has copied from
the writings of another man is not re
garded as having done anything dishon
orable. Ii the student trie? by copying to
win scholarships and prizes he is con
demned by his fellows, but in ordinary
examinations where a failure to make a
good showing would put the student in
danger of losing his degree his com
panions^ condone the offense. They re
gard the man as having miised an educa
tional opportunity, but consider the loss
as his own, and conclude that for the fac
ulty to suspend him would be unjust.
Some sample* of the Kind of excuses of
fered are given by the Dean, aud among
them the amusinu one of a student who
sail that he copied from a book so well
known that the instructor could not possi
bly suppose he meant to deceive; that he
iigreed with Thackeray's ideas and could
not improve on hi 3 language.
The Dean holds that such practice? are
clear cases of lying, and he makes a com
parison with the case of a man invited to
lecture before a society of gentlemen and
who reads without acknowledgment an
other man's work. This offen-e is not a
breach of rules merely, but it is clear-cut
fraud. Such a man may well he forgiven
by friends, but till lime and thought have
changed him ho cannot be accounted
trustworthy.
Another offense to which the Dean calls
attention is whai the students call "rag
tring" signs, and consider a mere frolic,
free from any dishonor. The Dean says
that these sign 3 are other men's prop
erty, which have cost money, and which
money alone can replace, and therefore
ihe man that takes them is a thief, and
moreover a tt.ief without the excuse of
hunger or poverty.
There- have for some time back been
complaints from the students that they
were pestered by a superfluity of rules; as
if they were mere cbi.dren, to be governed
in every little detail of conduct. Tni.-Â» re
port of Dean Briggs would indicate that
there are two sides to the question, and
that the students havÂ«> not so completely
put away the froiicsomeness of boyhood
as to be rightly freed from the restraints
that might be an Indignity to mature men.
THE LINCOLN BANQUET.
The banquets held by Republican organ
izations in various sections of the Uniou
in celebration of ttie birthday of Abraham
L ncoln afford a striking contrast to those
which were held by Democrats in celebra
tion cf Jackson's day. The salient feature
of the Democratic feasts was the intensity
of the antagonism between the various
factions oi the party, while that of the
Republican celebrations was the harmony
which prevails throughout the whole
orgarrzation in all the States of the
Union.
The only State in which there is at this
time even a suggestion of Republican dis
cord is Ohio, and the cciebration of Lin
coln's birthday in that State gave ample
evidence that these suggestions come more
from the desir? of Democrats than from
anything in the actual condition of ha
party. The chief banquet of the day in
Ohio was held in Zanesville, where the
Republican Laague Convention in the
State had jus*, been held. At this banquet
there appeared the leaders of both the s-o
--called factions. There were present Gov
ernor Bushnell and Marcus A. Hanna,
between whom, according to the Demo
crats, there is a bitter feud. Not one word
of any speech nor one action of any guest
at the banquet cave a particle of evidence
to confirm the Democratic assertions of
party division in the State. The proceed
ing throughout were full of harmony and
party loyalty and it was made amply
manifest that in Ohio, as well as elsewhere,
the Republican party stands united in its
opposition to the common foe and in its
determination to maintain the welfare of
the Republic.
The most noablo speeches of the occa
sion wera those made by Hon. William
A. White of Kansas at the Ohio banquet
and by Governo- I'ingree of Michigan at
Chicago. Mr. White pointed out the rea
son why Kansas ha- fallen from the Re
publican column, and showed by what
means it can be brought back to Its former
loyalty. Governor Pin^ree spoke of the
important subject of municipal reform
and the duty of the Republican party
with regard to it. and outlined a policy in
which, it is safe to say, he will have the
cordial support of Republicans every
where.
f?ince the two great parties of the coun
try have, by common consent, selected the
anniversary of the battle of New Orleans
and the anniversary of the birthday of
Lincoln as feast days, it would be well if
the observance were made more general
throughout the Union. There ought to be
Republican banquets in every important
town in the United Slates on Lincoln's
birthday, and there ought also to be Dem
ocratic banquets equally universal on the
day which has been chosen to do honor to
Andrew Jackson. Buch gatherings have
more than a mere partisan effect. They
â¢erve to recall the fundamental principles
of political parties and the memories of
the great statesmen and heroes of the
country. Certainly San Francisco should
vie with Eastern cities in maintaining
the?e memorial days, and we trust that in
iuture it will do so.
The Sorosis Club of New i'ork ha 3 de
clared in favor of international marriages
on the ground that they are calculated to
promote international peace, and that
shows how much the old girls of the So
rosis know about matrimony.
SECRETARY FRANCIS AND THE RED MEN.
P(. Louis Globe-Democrat.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 4.â The duties of the Secretary of the Interior are varied. After
five months' experience Dav:d R. Francis thought he understood fairly well what was ex
pected of him. He has, however, just undergone an ordeal which broke his record. The
other morning he received word from the Indian Bureau that a delegation of Bannocks and
Shoshoaes was in the city and would not leave entirely satisfied without a personal powwow
with the Secretary.
"Send them over," replied the Secretary, and he thought no more of It until the party
in Blankets and feathers solemnly stalked into his big ofllec in the corner of the Interior
Duildinc.
The Indians arranged themselves around the sides of the room and stood silent for a few
moments. Then the principal chief drew from the folds of his blanket a pipe and a
bag. The Secretary Is willing to make affidavit thai in all his life in Kentucky ho never

THE GREATER BENEFACTOR.
From the Baltimore Herald.
In observing the comforts and the leisure
enjoyed by tha rich we are disposed to form
erroneous views as to the nature of wealth. It
exists only as long as the wheels of human
progress ate hept in motion. When they stop
it is dissipated like air. Notwithstanding our
boasted accumulations we are always within
a year of going naked and within less than
that time of starving to death. Let all pro
duction cease and the world will soon be re
uuced to the greatest extremities. He who
devotes his fortune to charity does good, but
the greater benefactor is tne man who pro
vides employment for the peoDle.

Â¥^Â¥;--ENRY VAN BRUNT, writing in the J
â ^â¢HÂ£ Inland Architect and News Record, !
4iV|^ said that John Root was one of the \
most interesting personalities in the history :
of modern architecture. This opinion will be.
indorsed by every one who has the pleasure of j
ending tnis study of his life and work by Miss I
Harriet Monroe, and tney will add to it the j
opinion that the book has enriched our litera- !
Hire with one of the most attractively written ;
biographies of modern times. It is a volume |
â which should be read by architects, and Dy
all those who expect to build a home or have
a voice in the selection of plans for any build?
ing, and by those diligent seekers after
breadth of culture who would like to know
some of the best that has been thought and
said about "the most useful of the fine arts
and the finest of the useful arts" by one of the
. foremost of American architects.
The history of John Root will be of Interest
to the general reader, because his was a char
acter of singular strength and beauty, and the
literary charm with which it is narrated will
make it doubly interesting to those who love
excellence of style for its own sake and as a
thing aside from the importance of the story
told.
Mr. Root was born in Georgia in 1850. His
father was. a native of New England, his
mother a Southerner, and in his blood was
blended the puritan and the cavalier. Even
from his birth his parents planned that this
boy should be artisticâ he must love music,
poetry and picturesâ the gifts of Pallas were
besought for him. His father's baffled long
" ings to be an architect were to be fulfilled in
the son, the stateliness and beauty of build
ings were to be his contribution to the world's
loveliness. The wish of his parents was boun
tifully granted. The aspiration planted in the
boy's breast produced a harvest of achieve
ment in manhood. An enduring monument
to his memory exists in the gracetul piles that
have made permanent in solid masonry the
beauty of his thoughts.
A fondness for music and a most precocious
capacity for making It was the first form in
which Mr. Root evinced his artistic tastes.
But music came so easily to him that all his
life he male it his play and recreation, while I
he devoted himself to architecture as the seri- i
ous business of his days. He was graduated j
with high honors from the University of New
York, receiving the degree of bachelor of sci
â¢ ence and civil engineering. His working life
was spent chiefly in Chicago, whither he went
soon after the Â«reat fire with $300 capital.
His success Is a story of persistent struggle I
against discouragements. It was four years i
before his talents found such recognition that j
J his earnings amounted to $1500 a year. . A j
story illustrative of his generosity while under !
the stress of hart' limes is that once being
moneyless at the time of a friend's marriage
he pawned bis watch for $20 in order to bur
the briae a present. He put his music to prac
tical use in the first rears in Chicago by play
ing the organ in a church to help out his in
come.
The future held great things in store for
him, however, and as soon as ft was discovered
â¢what he could do he was crowded with re- j
munerative work. He planned buildings that â 
have been erected in many cities and are con
sidered masterpieces, some of them ranging
in value from ,$400,000 to $1,000,000. The j
catalogue of his creations covers five large j
pages. Besides the many magnificent build
ings in Chicago, he has to his credit a number |
in distant cities. Among them is the Monte- I
zuma Hotel in New Mexico, which is the ma- j
â¢ terialization of an architect's dream of beauty.
. Another is the Equitable building in Atlanta,
which surpasses anything in that fair city.
The Mills building in San' Francisco was de
signed by him and is considered a fine ex
ample of his power. It is said to be one of the
raost successful of all that class of his buildings
in which the commercial idea alone demanded
expression.
The temple he designed for the Woman's
Cnristian Temperance Union in Chicago is said
to combine the elements of a motive of senti
ment and aspiration and the commercial ideal
in a wonderful harmony. Mr. Van Brunt
says of it: "As an expression of strength and
Signity crowned worthily by beauty and
grace no nobler example has been given in
modern times." The great archway in the
Western Union building in Chicago is one of
his mesterpieces and the balconied porch of
the Insurance Exchange another. But theie
are far too many to enumerate.
Mr. Root formed a partnership with David
H. Burnham early In his career, and the firm
of Burnham & Root worked harmoniously for
eighteen years and was only dissolved by the
death of Root In 1891. Root had charge of
the department of design. The big office force
â was so well organized and wonted with such
sympathetic accord and ambition that it ac
complished work astonishing in its combina
tion of quantity with perfection of detail.
Root designed with facile speed and had un
usual powers of application and endurance of
mental strain. It was only at the last he real
ized that he had overworked himself.
Notwithstanding the extent of the work
done by this prolific designer his biographer
tells us that he never became absorbed in his
work so completely as to dwarf to dispropor
tion the other parts of life. She tells us that
to him life was more than art. He succeeded !
in making himself so well beloved that strong
men wept when death came to him in the i
prime of his career. The most remarkable !
thing about him is said to have been the com- I
plete harmony of his whole being. He was de
veloped at all points and his character per
fectly rounded. His fellow-artists bore wit
ness to his modestyâ one so great a final
proof of greatness."
The social side of bis nature made him the
life of many clubs and he was instrumental in
founding a number of these. His biography
is the story of a joyous life. He had sympa
thy es well as strength, and men whom he
had aided sobbed like children when they
heard of his death. One trait of his character
was his subordination of his personality to the
great forces behind the progress of events; he
seems to have regarded himself 89 a mere in
strument played upon by unseen powers, and
made the music of a happy and highly useful
life with no thought of Individual merit. -
Tne esteem of Mr. Root's fellow-craftsmen is
evidenced by his having been made president
of the Western Association of Architects, and
when they were merged into the American
Institute oi Architects he was appointed to the
Important duties of secretary of that associa
tion. He was consulting architect of the
World's Fair at Chicago, and to him was en
trusted the selection of the board of architects
who planned the wonders of the White City.
In the division of labor he was assigned the
designing of the fine arts building, which of
course had to be the most artistic of all that
creation of grace and grandeur. , His pre
vention by death from participating fully in
the great work was deplored as a calamity by
that galaxy of genius which made the dream

Competent judges of the glory of architec
ture regret that an early death deprived
America of the fully ripened fruit of his
genius. His aspirations lacked much of fulfill
â¢ ment. ills biographer says: "The large com
mercial structures, which must be pronounced
his most important contribution to architec
lure, in a certain way do violence to his
memory. He was deeply an artist, a poet;
profoundly a lover of his kind, a dreamer of
God. Temples of art, of music, of religion
â¢^cre what he chiefly longed to do; but' along
with the opportunity for these came the
higher opportunity of death."
To read the life of such a man as John Well
| born Root must needs be interesting and in-
I structive, not only becauso of Its Illumination
; of the noble art of architecture, the building
of music and poetry into form to delight and
| inspire every beholder, but also because of its
1 illumination of the fact that in the building
up of character poetry and music can find
; expression in the- conduct of a life stately,
! strong and beautiful, like some great archi
j tectural masterpiece. The book which gives
i the public the benefit of these two studies is
ibo happy in its selections of what Root
I said about art and life, and in what it tells us
about his personality, and is written in such
pleasing literary style, that it will be found as
absorbingly interesting as some great novel.

sale by William Doxey, Palace Hotel, city.
The Sturdy Beggar in this cleverly written
little book was an artist who maintained that
a true genius of art could never do hireling
i work. He was a very talented man
j and a great art critic. One night
he dropped into the studio of a young
sculptor who had just finished after long labor
a statue of "Prudence," for which he was to
receive a big sum of money. Tno Sturdy Beg
gar convinced the ambitious young man that
I he ought to destroy his work, and ho was
| just about to smash it up with a hammer when
; a friend came in ana stopped the destruction.
[ The caustic and learned critic turned out to
be a madman who had escaped from a lunatic
asylum.

The Laay Bramber in this tale is a great j
social success, and in addition to that glory
she makes a big reputation as an author by
representing as her own the work of her
divorced husband, who is a morphine
eater, but a literary genius. This
wretched man is the "ghost" of the story. A
young newspaper man discovers the fraud, but

This book of charades contains queries cal

of answering them correctly, and the language
used in asking them is quite pretty and often
poetical. It contains a table Dy which thÂ«

Ruskin's Philanthropy.
From time to time references are made to
the sacrifice of his fortune made by Ruskin
for the benefit of the poor. The Home Jour
nal gives some of the interesting and inspiring
details af this sacrifice:
'Through his father Mr. Ruskin fell heir to
nearly 000,000. to which must be added
the income of his writings. But this man
counted his treasures as a trust fund, held in
the interests of suffering merit or youth's
promising talent. That he was on the London
committee for the victualing of Paris in 1871
proves that his benevolence was as well known
as Peabody's or Lady Burdett-Coutts'. Taxing
himself first a tentn, then half, he finally gave
his entire income. If he needed botanical
and art works lor his studies he crippled him
self rather than refuse his . last spare 20
guineas to the widow of a dead artist. If for
health's Rake and art's sake he wanted to take
a trip to Switzerland, he would forego it
that he might contribute Â£100 to the
Cruikshank memorial. If others would
not encourage the study of art in
schools, he would buy ten water-color draw-
Ings of William Hunt, paying for each 9875,
and give them to the public schools of Lon
don. In one of his letters to the workingmen'
of Great Britain he told them what he had
done and was doing with his money in carry
ing on his St. George's Guild and his plans for
rent reform. Up to 1877 he had given away
ail his fortune save $250,000. Hut, in view or
the needs of his workingmen's club-, this
amount seemed much too large for his per
sonal wants. He therefore determined to dis
tribute all save Â£12,000 worth of consols the
interest of which would bring him some Â£300.
Upon this interest he now lives, the income of
his books being distributed among his ser
vants, his old pensioners and his various plans
for social reform.'
He bestowed his art treasures, we are further
told, with like generosity, on institutions
where the poor would have access to them.
He anticipated General Booth by founding a
guild to redeem waste lands and regenerate
ruined lives. Under his influence the his
torian Green spent several years in work
among the London poor. The best lectures of
the great art critic, it is said, have never been
given where wealth and social prestige were
represented, but before working-girls' and
workingmen's associations.
The Value of the â¢â¢Times.*'
Any one who wants to get an Idea of the
value of a big newspaper may take as a basis
the estimated profit of shareholders of the
London Times, as suggested in a recent trial.
Mr. Adams bought one-fourteenth of two
thirds of one-ninth -of two-sixteerths (or
1-1512) of the Times from Mr. Brodie lor Â£353,
on the assurance that this minute share was
worth Â£25 per annum. According to him,
after ho had purchased the share he found it
only to be worth Â£17 a year. Oi this he asked
for damages. A jury assessed the damages at
Â£05. Assuming this share to be worth Â£18 per
annum (which seems about the average
value), ills clear, says London Truth, that the
net dividend on shares is Â£27,216. Mr. Adams,
believing It to De worth Â£352, paid for it 14.1

Barrie Hard Hit.
This is how tho "Chap Book" comments
upon J. M. Barrle's latest work, "Margaret
Ogllvy":
When Forster published hu "Life of Charles
Dickens" it was said that the proper title for
the book should have been "Liie of Forster
With Reminiscences of Charles Dickens."
Pretty much the same may be said of "Mar
garet Ogilvy," Mr. Barrio's memoir of his
mother. The book should have beon called,
"James M. Barrie as a Son ; how he carried
shawls and made beds and scoured plates In
his own home; and went to London; and
wrote books about his friends and relatives; j
and the strange faces lie made while writ- !
ing them; what he thought of things in
general and himself in particular; with
full details of his dally habits and
domestic life and occasional glimpses of
Ills Mother. " Nothinr less would give a true
idea of Mr. Barries quiet way of creeping to
the front of the stage himself. The book is
not about his mother; it is about Mr. Bnrrle. |
No one who knows Mr. Barrieâ a more modest I
or more refined man never livedâ will hoid him j
consciously to blame for this mishap. He (
started out to give us a sketch of his mother;
to make the picture a true one he was com
pelled to bring himself in; and quite Dy acci
dentâthese things will happen somehowâ he
has made himself the central figure in the
foreground. The impression left by the me
moir is that Mr. Barrie was a most dutiful and
well-behaved young man. As a work
of art the book is undoubtedly a very
dainty piece of literature. But it is im
possible for the reader io rid himself of
the impression of artificialityâ not so ranch In
the execution, as in the idea of the thing; the
instinct that it is unn aural for a Han to sit
down and turn his home life into public copy
and sell for money a description, however pa
theiic, of his mother's and sisters deathbed.
Xiifere is something too theatrical about it;

Brier pip, 1 ;
When the flavor of the weed within is ripe;
vVhat a lullaby it purls
As the smoke around me curls,
Mounting slow*)- hipher, higher,
As 1 dreum beiore tne lire,
With a Savor in my moutn
Like a zephyr from the south.
And my favorite tobacco
By my sideâ
Near my Mi!<\
With the soothing necromancy
Sweetly linking fact to fancy
In a golden memory chain
To the gurgle, sweet refrain,
Of my pipe. Drier pipe,
To the faucy-breeding gurgle of my pip?.
Oh, what subtle satisfaction in my pipe,
Brier pipe:
Nothing mundane can impart
Such contentment to my heart;
She's my idle, she's my queen,
Is my lady Nicotine.
Whon in trouble how I yearn
For the inoenie which I burn
At her shrine.
How 1 pine
For the frugrance of her breath;
Robbed of terror c'en is death
By her harmless hypnotism;
Healed Is every mortal 6chisra.
Foe and friend
Sweetly blend
At the burning of the brier;
Greed, cup dity. desire
Fade away within the smoke,

From my pipe, magic pipe,
From my glowing, peace - bestowing,
gurgling pipp.

that smacks too much of the set funeral
tion over the grave of an eminent Frenchman.
Mr. Barrie, by tact and sheer literary ability,
has concealed the innate deceitfulness of his
task; but if books of tie "Margaret Osjilvy"
style become common, feebler hands will notso
conceal it. And it is interesting to note that the
Scotsman, the most literary of all Scotch papers,
condemns the motif of the boos as "alien and
repulsive to the Scottish nature." If that is
so, the Scotch are for once in harmony with
the rest of the world. We commented in the
last number of the "Chap Book" on the dex
terous methods by which the American pub
lishers of the book have shifted its interest
from Maignret Ogilvy to Mr. Barrie, booming
it us purely personal gossip, and already tho
world is being told that such and such a
character is Mr. Stead and so and so is Lord
Rosebery, nnd this editor is Mr. Frederick
Greenwood and that Kind friend is of course
Dr. Robertson Nicoll. Whatever on earth has
all this to do with Margaret Ogilvy?
Who Is the Author?

of so beautiful avers.*: "John Anderson, my

verse lately (1887) added to it t>y a gentleman
in Northern Oiilo proved it far from being per

manuscript, as taken from the lips of the au
thor, and should make his name famous if he
never wrote another line. I have copied it
into the margin of my Burns alongside the
poem, and also copy it here to preserve it fur

A broken toy ! what memories cling
Around this half-forgotten thing;
What baby laughter seems to rise,
Like old, delightiui melodies ;
What shouts of wordles--, tuneful joy,
At sight of this poor broken toy 1
Oh, tiny feet that would not rest!
Oh, dear head pillowed on our breast,
What would we give to hold again
The form we lost, 'mid tears and pain!
Ah, child! the empiv cot is ours,
But thine the sunshine and the flowers!
What could we give thee, shouldst thou come
T.j smile again upon thy home?
Such little pleasures as we know
In this, our twilight life below:
Some fragments of earth's paltry joyi,
A handful of Its broken toys I
How calm thy lot, forever blest;
How exquisite thy happy rest!
How changeless, joyful and serene
Compared with what thy lot had been
With us, whose flee'.lng. clouded joys
Are at their best but broken toys.

Mr. I. Zangwill, famous as the author of
"The Children of the Ghetto," has completed
another book concerning Jewish life, which
will be entitled "Dreamers of. the Ghetto."
From a business point of view thig second
title is not chosen happily, and it is to be
feared that comparisons, always odious in
themselves, will be made between the books
bearing names so nearly similar. "The Chil
dren of the Ghetto" is not the only fiction Mr.
Zangwill has produced, but it's the only one
so far which could have given him any dis
tinction. "Dreamers of the Ghetto" will be
awaited eagerlyâ and somewhat anxiouslyâ
by those who recognize in its author some
thing quite out of the ordinary so far as liter
ary ability is concerned.
The English papers arc still discussing the
new masterpiece, as they classify Mrs. Steel's
wonderful novel of .the great mutiny, ''On the
Face of the Waters." The Macmillan Company
have announced their edition of it for publi
i cation the 20th inst., but are forced by delays
I In press to postpone it for a week. It will
surely be ready by the end of the month. It
i is a compact book (the English edition has
J about 430 pages, the American about 479, the
| increase being due merely to a difference of
i type), but tn its intense unwavering interest
i its iength is unnoticed. The scene is for the
most part in Delhi, and her marvelous palace,
the Cantonment, the Ridge, or the narrow
streets, even the noise of the bazaar, are de
scribed with a vivid vitality which is rarely
I equaled and cannot be surpassed. Mrs. Steel
i has the rare gift of writing in colors.
Among the several works left by Robert
Louis Stevenson unpublished at his death, un
| doubtedly the one of completest and widest
interest is a romance entitled "St. Ives." Un
like "Weir of Hermiston," the only other
novel left by Stevenson unpublished, "Bt.
Ives" was left all but complete, and it ii, those
say who have read it, a straight-away, honest
tale of adventure, related in Stevenson's most
spirited and charming vein. It is a love story,
and records in particular the exploits of a
very cool, audacious, attractive French soldier
who becomes a prisoner of war in Edinburgh
Castle. Ttie exclusive right of serial publica
tion of "'St. lye&" for America was purchased
soon i.fter Stevenson's death by McClure's
Magazine, and the publication will begin in
the March number ol that periodical.

TJir: YEAR OF SHAMEâ tfy William Watson.
New York: John Lane pub isher. Tha Bodley
Head. For tale in this City by William Doxey, |
Palace iioiel. Price $1.
This book consists of about two dozen ahort j
poems and sonnets, most of which are reprints :
from Mr. Watson's pamphlet, "The Purple
East." The others have from time to time
appeared in the columns of London newspa
pers.
To the present collection the Bishop of Here
ford contributes a pretace. He points out that
then poems were written more as a patriotic
ppt a- to Englishmen than merely as a poet's
impassioned utterance. The appeal la specifi
cally addressed to those Britons who, seated
at warm firesides in comfortable homes, shake
their heads negatively at the idea of any of
the great European powers interfering with
the course of Armenian massacres on accaunt
of the commercial or financial disturbances
such action would entail.
"The commercial jingo," says the Bishop of
Hereford, "isunuappily becoming very promi
nent in English life, and is very militant if
any material interests are threatened, but all
for peace and patience* and concerted action
when the only thing concerned is a question
oi old-tashioned honor and moral obligation."
Much as the average business man affects to
despise the criticism of the churchman, the
careful reader of events of the past twelve |
months cannot fail to perceive the truth of |
the English cleric's words and to agree with
him in his assertion that the "s",and by and
hands off" policy adopted by the powers
toward the unspeakable Turk in merely the
result of the prompting of the bondholder and
the speculator. This being so. what becomes
of Britain's claim, iterated and reiterated, that
she is the friend of the oppressed? Where is
the old-fashioned, chivalrous idea of assisting
the downtrodden of the earth, so often ad
vanced as one of the component parts of the j
.Englishman's make-up? Can it be that this <
tradition will not be carried down to posterity
as one belonging to the present generation of
Englishmen?
"The Year of Shame," it can safely be proph
esied, will not make pleasant reading to resi
dents of the United Kingdom nor the colonies, j
The poems are written with an almost brutal
directness and power, as If their writer were
in dead'.y earnest, meaning every word that
he uttered, warning Englishmen that national
honor and tradition must at all risks be pre
served from sacrifice at the altar of mercenary
consideration. What, for instance, do Albion's
sons think of this appeal ?
A HURRIED FUNERAL.
A little deeper, sexton. You forget
She you would bury 'neath so thin a crust
Of loam was fiery -soaled, and ev'n in dust
eh>- may lie restles*. she may toss and fret,
Nay, she might break a seal too lightly sec.
And vex, unmannerly, our easy! she must
I enealh no lack of English earth lie thrust,
Would we uubauDteo sleep! Nay, deeper yet.
Quick, friend, the cortege comes, 'lht-reâ that will
serve;
Deep enough now; ana thoa'lt need all thy nerve,
If, In her coffin, at the last, amid
The mourners in the customary suits.
And to the scandal of these decent mutes.
This corpse of i-ugiaud's Honor burst the lid!
Englishmen aro sturdy and materialistic,
not sentimental; but lives there the Briton
who would not biush at the Imputation con
tamed in the last half a dozen lines?
Another remarkable poem in this collection
is the one entitled "Repudiated Responsi
bility," wherein the callous Indifference of
England to Ottoman atrocities is lashed:
REPUDIATED RESPONSIBILITY.
I bad not thought to hear it voiced so plain,
Uttered so forthright, on their tips who steer
ThU nation a course: I had not thought to hear
That word re-echoed by an English thane,
Guilt's maiden speech when first a man iajMlain,
"Am Imy brother's keeper?" Yet full near
It sound -d, and the syllab es rang clear
As the immortal rhetoric of Cain.
â â Wherefore should ue, airs, more than theyâ or
they â
Unto these helpless reach a hand to save?"
An KiiKii-h thane. In this our English air,
Speaking for England? Then Indeed her day
Blopes 10 its twilight, and, for Honor, there
is needed but a requkem and a grave.
Verily, to quote again from the Bishop of
Hereford's introduction, "It is the spirit of
lstiiah that is represented in this book of
poems â¢ â¢ â¢ making us feel that behind
these desolated Armenian homes, those tor
tured and murdered men, those dishonored
| and heart-broken women, there stands the
'.vision of a stern and unavoidable reckoning
fur those who might have saved and would not
or dared not."
It is a relief to turn from verses of so de
nunciatory a character as those quoted to ones
no less earnest, but breathing a more frater
nal spirit, in the following lines it will be
seen that the poet, disdaining to recognize the
independent English jingo, extends the hand
of fellowship to the "nolf-brother of the
world":
KNOLAND TO AMERICA.
O towering daughter, Titan of the WeÂ»Â»,
Behind a thousand leagues of foam secure;
Thou toward whom our inmost heart is pure
Of ill intent; although tnou threatcnest
With most unfllial hand thy mother's brenst,
Not for one breathing space may earth endure
The thought of war's Intolerable cure
For such vague pains as vex to-day thy real!
But if ttaoa bast more strength than thou canst
spo nd
In tasks of peace, and find'st her yoke too tame.
Help us to smite the cruel, to befriend
The succorless, and put the false to shame.
So shall the ages laud thee. and thy name
Be lovely among nations to the end.

records of. Arctic exploration. The expedition
was not a mere feat. In physical geography,
in biology, in meteorology, the results ob

various sciences concerned.
The work on Byron on which Clement K.
Shorter is engaged is not likely to see the light
for some considerable time yet. It will be a
volume about the sice of hia Bronte book. It
will not contain any letters and. therefore, its
interest will be in no way affVcted by any suc
cess which may attach to Mr. Henley's edition
of Byron or by Lord Lovelace's "Life and
Work?," which Mr. Murray is to publish. Mr.
Shorter proposes to set forth the details of
Byron's career in chapters. The first chapter
will be enti tied "The Mad Byrons," thesecona
"The Gay UoidouÃ," iiie third 'Childhood ia
Aberdeen." In these more stress will be laid
than has ever hitherto been done on the part
played by heredity In Byron's life and ou the

Scotch surroundings of his early years. Mr.

Vol. I, "Discovery and Colonization" (1492
--1689). Vol. 11, "Making the Republic" (1689
--1783). Vol. 111, "Growth of the Nation" (1783

--1896). This series is made up entirely from,
the original sources of American history, the*
records and narratives of men who wit
nessed and shared in the events which they
describe. Extracts long enough in eiÂ»ch case
to give some idea of the writer's style are
arranged In a logical sequence, so as to make
up a general account oi the times from the
first voyages to the present day. To each,
volume is prefixed a practical introduction on
the use of sources by teachers, students, pupils,
libraries and readers, with a bibliography of
the most valuable sources and collections.
The Peter Paul Book Company of Buffalo
have In press a volume of poems by Irving
Browne, who was for many years editor of the
Aloany Law Journal. Few of them have been
published, but those have had a popular ac
ceptance tnrough several of the leading
literary newspapers. The volume will contain
none of his numerous legal poems, but
only lyrics and ballads, grave and hu
morous, and the title and arrange
ment are quite novel and Ingenious.
Under the title, "The House of the Heart,"
they are distributed under the following sub
headings, according to their pertinency: the
Windows Looking Over Sea, on the Street, the
AY oods, the Churchyard; By the Hall Fire; In
the Bedroom, the Nursery, the Library, the
Garret, the Tower. The edition for sale will be
limited to 300 copies, will be printed from
type, and In the very neat form which .might
be expected from a person of Mr. Brown's well"
known bibliophllic taste.
The February Ladles' Home Journal opens
with a striking articleâ "When Kossuth Rode
Up Broadway"â the fourth of its "Great Per
sonal Events" series. In it Parke Godwin re
calls the unprecedented demonstration and
enthusiasm with which the Hungarian exile
was welcomed to New York; also his patriotic
but Tain mission to this country. Charles
Dana Gibson's second drawing of Dickens' peo
pleâportraying Dick Swiveller and the Mar
chionessâworthily occupies a prominent place
In the excellent magazine. The splendor and
sumptuousness which marked the festivities
incident to a doable royal wedding in the
Imperial palace of the German capital is
glowingly reflected In a "Page at the Ber
lin Court" In a delightful vein Edward
Page Gaston writes of the winsome belles of
Mexico and the restraining barriers that so
cial customs of the land interpose between lov
ers during courtship. An article that will ap
peal to women is Mrs. Talcott Williams' sketch
of "The Most Famous Cook in America." The
February Journal also presents the first of
Mrs. S. T. Borer's Cooking Lessons: "Ideal
Cooking" and "How to Make Soups." These
are the initial contributions to thedepartment
she will hereafter conduct in the Journalâ the
only publication for which she writes. "The
Senate and House of Representatives" is tho
subject of ex-President Harrison's "This Coun
try of Ours" paper, and he expresses himself
very forcibly upon several points. Edward W.
Bok writes in vigorous denunciation of the
"wishy-washy" books to be found In Sunday
school libraries, and points an easy way to
secure better literature for Sunday -schoolchil

attractive series of sketches of surviving
daughters of Chief Executives, and "The
Origin of Our Popular Songs," by William
George Jordan, relates the interesting circum

many of our favorite melodies. Dwight

: J in the portion of this Parisian epistle
â ^ that treats of some toilettes recently
vcrn at several of the large weddings in
that capital. Uno fair maiden wore on the
occasion of her marriage nn exceptionally
rich white duchesse satin nacre made a ia
princess. The train measured three yards
and the bodice had a bolero of old point
d'Angleterre, and was draped with tulle.
"White satin formed the waistband and the
sleeves were slightly fnlt at the top and
draped, and from those fitted tiphtly to
the waist with point d'Angelterre falling
over the hand 3. The talle veil covered
her face and dre3s and extended to the
end ot the train, and with it was worn a
tiara of oiange blossoms. The bride's
mother was artistically arrayed in a
velvet glace, flax blue in color. On the
skirt were quille 1 " of pale golden-lined em
broidery, and on the bodice similar quilles
appeared, as well as a jabot of line Alen
con. Only at the shoulders were the
sleeves slightly puffed. The capote of
blue velvet was beautified with goid and
silver embroidery, and at the left side
arose several fine black ostrich tips ana
an aigrette.
The groom's sister was arrayed with
equal taste in a robe o' oyster-gray satin,
which opened from the neck to the ioot,
over white satin worked with diamonds
and edged with Russian sable. The roll
ing collar was square in shape in the
Louis XIII style, the rarest Venetian lace
was employed. The neckband of white
satin and sable and in the style known as
tbe "Anne of Austria" was much ad
mired. The small capote of spangled
tulle had goura plume ana a white aigrette.

Ji Gala Dress
i
Just completed for the Dowager Duchess
d'Aosta 13 described as follows: "The
skirt was orar.ee velvet giace with pint,
made half long and very close-fitting on
the sides; at the back two or three box
pleats; the sides were white Mlin cov
ered with motifs of embroidery and span
sles on zauze; at the foot a thick ruche of
white tulle, bordered with rouleaux of
orange satin. The low bodice was satin,
the bacK embroidered and edged with a
tnlle ruche, the front of white satin em
broidered with diamonds and spangles,
and above this a narrow row of sable.
Orange corselet, edged with embroidered
and spangled satin ; very short sleeves
composed of tulle, sable and tufts of roses
shaded with yellow. This same dress
looks very well carried out in white velvet
and satin."
The Orchid Sown
Is one of the season's novelties. It is for
evening wear, and has a point de Venise
bodice, the decolletage and V-shaped vest
being edged with artificial orchid flowers
made of velvet with jeweled centers. The
epaulettes are cut in the shape of an
orchid petal. They are composed of lace,
heavily jeweled lace, and are wired to

s'.eeves. The sleeves merely consist of
miffs of gauzeâ very tinall onesâ caught
here and tuere with jeweled bands of tur
quoise velvet, simulating the stamens of
a flower, so that each sleeve looks Hkq a
great orchid. Tue tablier of the sown is
of exquisite lace, with orchids. The
gown is of a soft, rich, biuisn purple
silk.
For a debutante of slender proportions
there is nothing prettier than a rose boa
ice. A berthe of roses, composed of from
three to four rows of exquisite roses, buds
and foliage, is arranged gracefully around
the shoulders, crossing kerchief style
:n front and passing over a vest of
inousseline de soie. The two ends can be
fastened in the back at the waist line and
fall artistically, mingling with a great
tulle bow, which bas long ends. A thick
ruche of the flowers encircles the slcirt of
mous3ehne de soie, and the foundation of
the whole is pule rose taffeta. Such a
gown would be a complete tailure if at
tempted at home, for unless properly
handled the roses look both clumsy and
ugly.
Embroideries and Laces.
These are being offered in tempting pro
fusion at many of our leading stores at
rjrices that are simply wonderful consider
ing their artistic and other merit 3. The
shoppers ciited with imaginations and
foresight have been securing many yards
of embroidery, for it will be possible to
use most advantageously great quantities
of it, as well as lace, in all our spring and
summer garments. For example strips of
fine embroidery may be employed with
cobwebby batiste or chiffon, or DlacK vel
i vet to make really lovely bodices, which
! may ht tighuy*or looseiy, according to the
I taste or ligure of the wearer.
Collars of lace or embroidery are used
with excellent effect on ail house and
evening gowns, and boieros either cut
round or straight, loose or tight, pleated
or plain, wiil be seen all through the
spring and probably through the summer
as well. The pleated ones are most artis
tic, and can be evolved from a pieca of
! flouncing set into a double pleat on either
; shoulder and one in the center of the
back, under the arms. The flouncing
must set perfectly plain, and this style
can only be indulged in by slender
women. Down the front must extend an
applique of lace on either side. Such a
bolero can be worn over a high dress or
over a low one, and 1 hear it will look
very provided, of course, that the
materials used are of line quality, as in
deed it is useless to waste time over in
ierior cheap goods.
Boleros.
Boleros have become, I think, almost
common, although I confess they are most
becoming; to many figures, still they are be
ing overdone; however, it is an acknowl
edged fact that they are to hold theirown
for some time yet, and perfectly plain bole
ros of embroidered net or coarse or line lace
are being cut up uotonly for boleros but for
epaulettes also. Irish lace is really an
economical purchase, for it alwaya looks
well and will last a lifetime. When lace
bodices are made from it tnoy are usually
charming, and lace bodices arc daily in
creasing in popularity, being very becom
ing. Fine black lace mounted over white
net was recently used with great success
for a bodice that was worn with a black
satin skirt. The combination of dead
white and creamy white is still in votrue,
and lace skirts wili be popular for many
months to come; quite fetching is one
j which is gathered just below the hips and
forms a very full narrow ruche. It shows an
edeing at the knees, outlined with little
! frills of kilted ribbon. The same arrange
ment trims the hem. For half-mourning
a black lace skirt made in the same way
over white satin with frills of white rib
bon would be chic. The easiest way of
making such skirts is with llounein^s of
iace, two rows of this being eewn to
gether, and where they join the frills of
ribbou appear.
Sleeves.
The novelty of the season for ball
dresses, as far as sleeves are concerned,
emanates from Paris, even New York
Deing slow to adopt them. They are lu
cidly described as long mousquetaire
sleeves falling well over the hand-. The
lace, for instance, will be black pailette in
bright or dead silver, the spangles of the
smallest size. The sleeve will reach
above the elbow only on tbe top of the
arm, but will pass underner.th and attach
itself to a lace epaulette. Tho effect of the
sly use of bare arm is charming and the

sleeve most graceful, giving that length
of arm wbich adds so much to one's
height. Several of fashion's leaders in
New York have endeavortd to di card
these long sleeves on fnll-dres-3 gowns,
but without success. As yet the style has
not been seen more than once or twice
here, but I warn you all that they are
correct; so try them for your next ba'l
dress.
Skirts.
It has been derinitely decided that for
evening wear the open front, the orna
mented panel, the full gathered flounce
from the knee, starting from a ruche
which will border the hem, and the co
quille trimming â which, as ita name de
notes, is like a shell made cf pleating,
with, bouquets of violets or any flower
suitable in the center. All these modes
will bo seen.
"For day wear panels will al3o be used,
and flat bands, or after the nature of
tucks, headed by i'nr. The embroidery
will be principally relegated to evening
dresses, and there is nothing newer than
the Empre-s designs and those of Louis
XV reipn ; but a good many beautiful ga
lons and beaded motifs will be introduced
from the waist downward, and be carried
down the side. Ball gowns favor frills
in thin material?, clustered together at
the hem, and constituting the sleeves.
The V-shnped embroidered pieces on the
bodices become more and more elaborate,
and it is almost impossible to have too
many buckles in paste or too many dia
monds, or paste buttons. Soft frillings
and llounces of lace fall downward from
the bodice and are held in place by dia
mond ornaments."
Spring and Summer Goods
Are arriving in great quantities, but the
loveliest I have thus far noted were some
organdies. One beauty had a pure white
ground sprayed with the most perfectly
natural pink roses and their foliage I have
yet seen. The pink was a most becoming
tone, another having a creamy surface
was made lovely by the Miirechal Niel
bud scattered over it. Do not make a
Spring Rown of shot green silt, the ruffles edged with black ribbon velvet. Guipure lace

mistake in purchasing the remains of last
year's stock, the designs for the summer
of '07 are vastly prettier than any ever
shown before.
One noticeable fact is that all canvases,
etamines and grenadines are woven not
more loosely, but the silken linings
underneath. They are to be bad in a
positively endless variety, so that every
imaginable taste can be satisfied.
The heavy linen canvas with open work
insertions every inch and a half are ultra
chic. The remaining portion ia run with
silken hues; par example, one of ecru tint
is run with pale mauve satin stripes, and
the dress will be lined with exactly the
Mime color silk. You readily imagine the
charming effect, pale green, blue or a
eolden brown may also be had. This
fabric is forty-six inches wide and will not
be generally worn, as it costs $2 25 per
yard.
I A variety of grenadine looks as though
woven' out by a combination of thick
twisted strong strings and cobwebs. The
extremely stylish. if forty-six inches wide,
price $2 35 per yard. The new shade of
purple, brown, green and tan may be
had. .
. Cupio Tables
i Are the latest fad for milady's drawing
room. They are dainty, plush-lined re
eentacles, covered and surrounded with
glass, for precious miniatures, rare bits of
ivory, and priceless. gem-incrusted curios
should not be carelessly exposed to dust
or atmospheric changes, so now they rest
quite safely in their tinted, perfumed i
nests. Dames of high degree, who recall
with pride ye old colonial days, take es
pecial delight in Buch tables, and many a
bit of halMorgotten history is recalled as
they relate the quaint stories connected
with some tiny trifle. However, if the
fair owner of such a table is a bit of a bas
bleu there may be a miniature of Napo
leon painted by Isaby and given by some
ardent admirer of trie autocrat to some
distant relative of the owner. Or if the
fair collector is simply an up-to-date
woman her curio-table is crowded with
delightful knick-knacks, which she frankly
admits are all purchases of her own and
not heirloomsâ trifles . which she has
nicked ud ahrnnri â a. lovalv miniature of
Raphael's "Madonna of the Chair," a Rus
sian enamel spoon, hideous ivory statu
ette, a quaint old cup and saucer and per
haps a curious coin or two.
Girdles and Belts.
The fashionable brides of tc-day are
showing a fancy for the very extravagant
fad carried out in line pearls and known
as a "bride's girdle." Such a one can be
worn only with the wedding gown. At
the narrowest point it is but four inches
in width, and at the widest six; pearls
must completely cover the foundation,
and the lacing must be done with a fine
silver wire.
The Prir.ces3 Charles of Denmark has
at last decided to have the 100 selected
diamonds and rubies given to her by the
Queen on the occasion of her marriage
made into a belt, so the jewels are to be
mounted on a flexible gold wire. This
idea was suggested to the Princess when
she saw and admired greatly the famous
belt of the Duchess of Marlborough, which
is composed of magnificent stones.
Dressing of the .Hair./
It should be dressed in large loose
waves, the waves seen on many a hair
dresser's dummy in the windows having
long ago become common. French
women certainly make far more of their
hair than we do. At present they have it
rolled over a cushion in front, the soft |
knot at the back not being unduly promi- I
nent. Ornaments do not suit this mode,
and as a result they have been discarded.
It is a mistake if your face is too broad to
try and make it less noticeable by dress
ing your hair with a narrow effect in
front, as that only accentuates such
broadness; rather study. to have the hair
always in keeping with your especial
style, no matter what the prevailing mode.
Narrow oval faces are made lovelier than
ever when surrounded wit the soft, fluffy
frame of hair now so fashionable.
. ' Marcel la.
Fop .Men.
The men who desire to be correot in all
things should be extremely careful about
their stationery. Crane's bond paper,
size 4Ux7 inches, ia crood form, and then
either a crest or' monogram should be
stamped on it. Neither should bo more
than a fourth of an inch in height, and to
seal all letters use a seal with your arms
(if you have any) or your monogram.
The white lawn ties worn With full
evening dress are one inch wide, as are
also those of black satin worn with a
Tuxedo coat.
While satin waistcoats show no signs of
becoming fashionable, those of white
pique are being still worn for full evening
dress by the best turned-out men.
"Him" makes several sensible remarks
in his last article, so let me quote: "I
mink good business and good clothes go
together. The well-dressed smart-look
ing felJow has much more prestige than
the man in shabby and rusty clothes.
The suits designed for business wear are
comfortable, durable and cheap. They
; are made of good stout Sotch or Irish
stuffs. Warm plaids or overplaids in the
earthy Scotch shades are now very popu
lar. These plaiiis are no: loud. The color
scheme is well controlled, and though tho
shades used may ba very bright, they are
interwoven with moderate colors so clev
erly that one cannot tell where the bright
ness in the fabric come 3 from. Plaids
should be made up in single-breasted
sacks only. If you want a double-breasted
coat, have it made of a black or blue
cheviot, and wear it with fancy worsted
trousers. The double-breasted sack when
made of a plaid material always appears a
bit provincial.
"And now as to the cut of business suits.
If you are tall I should say a four-but
toned cutaway sack. If you are short
make it three buttons. The pocfcets
should be inserted, not patch, and should
have liberal flaps. There should be no
breast or handkerchief pocket. Have the
collar cut wide and have large lapels.
The waistcoat should be collarless. The
trousers should be exit in the regular way.
"With this suit wear a madras or a
cheviot suit. Select a pattern that will
harmonize well with your suiting. .For
example, 1 can'c bear to see eresn-striped
shirts in combination with nut-brown
suits. The collar should ba a straight
stander or poke, or a bigh-banded turn
down. If you wear a standing collar wear
a four-in-hand or an imperial scarf. If
you wear a high-banded turn-down collar
wear a club or string tie."
This completes the costume of his "ideal
business man." with either heavy cape or
deerskin gloves of a dark reddish tan, a
derby hat and russet or calf shoes.
It has been generally conceded that soft
Scotch suitings are not thoroughly satis
factory, as they wrinKle so eusiiy and
quickly bag at the knees. To look well
clothes must be kept properly pressed
either by your valet or your tailor.

%Hsol deep canyons and mighty cliffs,
â where snow and ice reign almost perpetu
ally, occurs a group of mines which are
' .without doubt the highest in the United
States,- and probably in North America.
They are embraced within the Homer
Mining District, which includes the region
about the head of Mill and Lake canyons.
.One of the culminating peaks of the dis
trict is Mount Scowdan, rising to an ele
vation of 12.500 feel above the sea. This
. mountain is inclosed between the two
canyons south of the little town of Lundy,
\ presenting a bold front which rises nearly :
4000 leet above it. The bold granite
cihTs are literally seamed with gold-bear-
Ing quartz veins even to it? very summit.
The May Lundy is the most noted of the
many mines on this mountain, having
. been worked for years with the produc- j
tion of a large amount of gold bullion. I
Let us glance for a few momenta at the
scenery of this wild spot and the condi- j
tions under which mining is carried on j
almost in the very clouds.
The region lies but a little to the west of j
Mono- Lakeâ that strange body of watar
6000 feet above the. sea, framed in desert ;
â  Bands and volcanic mountains, and with â 
"Waters-so alkaline that they soon destroy
. .most organic substance?. On the west is
. the bold scalp of the Sierra Nevada, ris
ing.6ooo feet higher, and from whose deep- j
â¢ hidden canyons .issue large, ice-cold |
. v reams, almost rivers in size, feeding
Btually the insatiable lake. The most. |
"^important of these are Rush, Leevining i
and Mill creeks, tne latter being the most .
. northerly and draining the region which
we .wish to investigate.
.. Passing over the regular and symmetri- â¢
â¢ clil glacial moraine as we ascend the open ;
â¢ s'o-pe of the desert country from the lake
Mill Creek Canyon is entered. We are
immediately shut in by towering walls,
continually growing higher farther up
the canyon, and so precipitous that every
winter is heard the deafening roar of the
avslance which too often finds some
miner's frail cabin in its path and bears it
to destruction.
â¢ . On a July morning, however, the scene
â¢is very different. The rocky walls stand
out bare and rugged. The bottom through
which the stream rashes is strewn with
bowlders and partly overgrown witn brush,
â¢ but here and there are little meadows and '
â¢ groups of tail pines. The road follows
up the canyon until finally there is reached '
beautiful lake about a mile lon-:, around â 
whose cliffs the road winds to reach at '
last the scattered little mining town of
â¢ Lundy. It has an altitude of about BOW
feet and must have teen a very pretty ',

there they are enlivened by the reddish or
vefiowisb tints characteristic of mineral
{regions. T.*e primeval beamy is gone
Vtrever. T. c trees have been felled, the
lake is partly filled up with sickens from
the quartz mills, and the cold, desolate
cliffs alone remain beyond the j-ower of
man to seriously mar.
Above the town on the left is the strik
ing pranite front of Mount Scowdan, that
preat mass of rock which hides so many
millions of shininggold, and in the search
for which tbe beautiful valleys have been
despoiled. The northern face of the
mountain bordering Hill Creek has been
nearly all located by mining claims.
These are reached by long and steep Â£{*â¢
z&g trails over the bowlder slope at the
base of the mountain proper. Over these j
sweep the winter avalanches, oiten carry
ing away rock?, trees and every vestige of
the trails. The veiii3 outcrop in the al
most vertical face of the mountain, and
the miner who spends the winter here is
.obliged to place his cabin under the pro
tecting points of rocK to avoid the con
stant danger from the avalanche. The
ore from the more accessible mines is i
packed down on mule back to the mill
near the town, but othsr* cannot be
reached in this manner. Daring mcc
- have climbed around the precipice and
carried a wire cable to connect with the
w. rkings of some small rich veins. This
enables them to let down the ore in buck
ets to a point at the bottom of the ciiffs
whence it can be taken to an arastra on
tfl c creek.
/â¢In Mill Creek Canyon, about two miles
fcbove the town of Lutuly, tuere lives one
of these free and independent miners. He
takes out the ore from his mine in the
clouds only as fast as it can be ground in
the arastra, not troubling himself with
a fortune which he cannot use. For a
hermit he lias a most enviable home. The
arahtra has been built under one wing ol
his cabin and is so conveniently arranged
that he can sit in his door, smote his pipe
and watch the slowly circlins miil grind
out the precious particles. When the rock
is all ground a few more days' work with
the aid of the cable and he is prepared for
another run. His cabin is in the center
Of the valley, which is a little wider here,
and the avaianches do not reach it. Thus
iie parses the years perfectly contented
ana bappy.
On the same side of Mill Creek Canyon
and in the great granite wall east of the
mouth of Lake Canyon lives another of
these hermits. His home is situated very
differently, however, being torched 'O
liicu in t c crags that a field-glass is
necessary to bring it into vision. The
cabin appears as a tiny speck in a little
rece 8 nearly 3000 feet above the town.
Puffs of smoke and echoing reports are
occasionally heard as this lone miser fol
lows up a pocket-seam, whence he
obtains nuggets varryine from twenty to
several hundred dollars in value.
But what about the May Lundy mine
the most noted one of the district? It is
not in sight from the town, but is situated
two miles away on the face of Mount
Scowdan, opposite Lake Canyon and 3000
leet above the town. The latter canyon en
ter? Mill Creek Canyon opposite Lundy, but
with a scarp 1000 feet high. Lake Canyon
is also bounded by precipitous walls
to 3000 feet hieb, and contains several
lakelets, originally very beautiful, but
now, alas, marred and partly filled with
slickens from the starup mill of the limy
Lundy mine. To gain the mouth of this
canyon a steep and zigzag trail leads up t c
side of Mill Creek Canyon, and then a gen
tle grade brings us to its head, near whicn
the mill is situated. One of the lakes lies
"higher still and tne stream whicn flows
from it is used to run the mill. The alti
tude here is 9600 feet and snowbanks lie
scattered around even in July. Although
the snow drifts here in the winter so as to
almost cover the trees the mill is kept
running the greater part ct the time. A
wire caDle 2-3CK.I feet long stretches upward
toward the highercJiffs of Mount Scowdan
until it is lost to sight, its presence being
marked by the little buckets which come
slowly down loaded with ore, and return
either empty or filled with the provisions
necessary to keep a large number of men
in working condition at an elevation of
over 2 1,000 feet.
The climb from the mill to the mine is
long and laborious, as the lightness of the
air becomes very noticeable. The habita
tion? of the men, as well as the superin
tendent's itlic?, are gathered in a little
notch in the mountain near the openings
of the main tunnels. The immediate sur
roundings are rather cheerless, nothing
but bare rock and snowdrifts, for at this
c-roat altitude the snow stays on in pro
tected spots all summer. A great bank of
icy snow lies between the tunnel from
which the ore 19 delivered to the cable
and the quarter, and across this the men
have worn a deep trail. The houses of
I tbe men are much like those of other
mines, if anything less pretentious. They
are perched upon spots which have been
partly leveled off and are often supported
by props from below to keep them from
tipping over and rolling into the depths
of the canyon. Above them tiie mountain
still towers nearly 1000 feet, and in the
j spring whon the snows are melting and
the rocks loosening bouders frequ ntly
come down in the moat dangerous fash
ion.
Everything which is used here costs, as
may be imagined, a good round sum.
With the excep;ion of vegetable*, which
I are raised in favorable years around the
I shores of Mono Lake, everything must be
obtained from some point on the Carscn
and Colorado Railroad and freighted some
100 miles to Lundy. From there, unless
the road happens to be in repair, which is
not generally the ca?e, they are packed on
mules to the mill and then ruined by cable
to the workings. Thus deprived of all but
the necessities of life and almost as iso
i i -.ted as the sailor upon the ocean, ii is not
to be wondered at that when a holiday
comes the men leave what is virtually a
prison, nnd relaxing in t c temptations of
the raining towns below, have to be al
most curried back to work when their
time is up. It would seem that mining at
such a spot, ai. an elevation of 11,000 feet,
wouid not oe attractive, but plenty of men
are always found.
There if a marked contrast between tbe
open air and the interior of the mine both
in winter and in summer. In winter it
must be a relief to escape from the arctic
storms and freezing temperature outside
to the drifts of the mine, hundreds of feet
from the surface, where there is but little
variation in temperature the year around.
In the summer, on the contrary, the drifts
and lunuels appear cold and damp in com-

Well, the children were growin' an'

an' what he had come out for, an' how ho

self that he'll stake a claim right there in

to eat.
Now, here the luck comes In. Layin'

AMATEUR VS. PROFESSIONAL
Baird JKroWs Ligkt or\ a Question That
Agitates the /Uhletic World
eNE of the subjects that is absorbing
t^lS the attention of tie public at tne
W*4w present time, and particularly
young men engaged in athletics, is "What
is an amateur?" W. . .;
When athletics were organized on a per
manent basis in this country in 1878 one
of the first acts performed by the newly
organized National Association of Ama
teur Athletes was to formulate a defini
tion of an amateur. This decree was com
prised in six or seven linÂ»s and was more
important and far-reaching than all the
other articles of the constitution put to
gether. The definition of an amateur v;Â«s
not only the cornerstone of the edifice
that has since grown to such stupendous
proportions, it was the Samson's pillar
bearing the weight of the entire structure.
The ideas therein contained were bor
rowed lrom England, the mother of ama
teur athletics, revised, modified or im
proved according to the judgment of the
legislators on amateur law.
When the influence of the National As
sociation began to wane and the Amateur
Athletic Union rose to its present posi
tion of power an idea was circulated that
it might be well to substitute "conditions
of competition" for the old "definition of
an amateur." On the reorganization of
the constitution of tne union upon us
present basis the two greatest changes
made were: The partition of the country
into "associations," of which there were
to be six, and (second) the adoption of the
new "conditions of competition."
It has been stated that we are indebted
to England for our amateur principles.
The origin of the idea, in that country
arose from their aristocratic establish
ment, which, as everybody knows, is very
elaborate. In that, country the people are
separated into two classes â "gentlemen
and commons." This division is not
clearly denned; however, the line of de
markation between the "aristocracy" on
one hand and the laboring and artisan
classes on the other is, so sharp that no
one can possibly make a mistake. Dis
putes to the claim of gentility arise
chiefly from what is termed the middle
class.
The better element of society recog
nized the fact that thare was a vast differ
ence between the runner, walker and
prize-fighter who expended ell their
efforts and most of their character on
making money, with little or no regard
for the rights of others or their own good
name, and those who did not. True, there
were some honest men among them, but
they made very little money compared
to their dishonest brethren, and the
struggling and lonely light which they
shed only served to make the surrounding
blackness more profound. At that time
even more than at present pedestrians
slipped a bit of soap in their mouths and
fell down at the critical point in a race be

ing at tao mouth; sprinters sold their

races with only one regard, that of the
lury of an outraged populace, and pugil
ists slugged each other with bare fasts in a
manner too revolting to describe.
At last the time came when the English
gentleman (and I use that term now as we
would use it) came to the conclusion that
if he would be, an athlete he must take
bis choice between mixine with such in
tolerable company or "Hock off by Him
self." Right here let me say that ama
teur athletics are founded on one of the
grandest impulses in the human breast,
namely, love. It is love of exe>cise and
the excitement of the contest alone that
inspires the real amateur. The foregoing
was written before it occurred to me that
"amateur" is derived from the Latin
amator, lover.
Having given the history of the defini
tion of an amateur, we will now consider
the conditions as prescribed by the Ama
teur Athletic Union. The law on this
subject is rather voluminous, covering as
it does over two closely primed pa^es of a
pamphlet. The object of its authors in
being so exhaustive was to leave no loop,
boles open tuat might give rise to dispute.
My intention is to boil down and rear
ranee the rules that they might be more
easily understood by those who are not
conversant on the subject.
First and most important of all the con
siderations which debar a man from com
peting with amateurs is the fact of his
having received money for the exercise of
his physical powers. This is the most
flagrant offense of its kind, the ieast ex
cusable and the easiest understood by the
public. His- offense may have been com
peting in some contest of physical strength
or speed and receiving money for a re
ward* It may have been for teaching in
a gymnasium or training an athlete or
team for some physical contest, or having
charge of athletic grounds. Here he
actually gets paid for his labor, or even if
he doe<s not get paid for athletic exhibi
tions he has at his disposal opportunities
for perfecting himself that the amateur
cannot haveâ at least the vast majority of
them.
But the receipt of money is not the only
thing that makes a man a professional.
It may be the only means at his disposal
of earning an honest living for himself
and family. If such be the case the man
is entitled to respect and is respected, for
I have seen professionals) of this character
and bearing a good name treated with
L'reat consideration by gentlemen ama
teurs of refinement and culture. Bow
ever, there are acts that will not only
make a man a professional, but will bring
down upon him ten times more contempt
than a lifetime of earnings in the profes
sional ranks â I refer to knavery. Such
tricks as selling a race, deliberately foul
ing a competitor, secretly injuring ma
chines in a bicycle racs and other im
moral practices will pitch a man from the
amateur ranks as though shot out of a
gun.
It seems lo me that the reader will have
no trouble in comprehending the defini
tion so far as I have chosen the
principles easiest understood. Let us
I now take up explanations a trifle more
I complicated. It will not be difficult for
any one to see why persons who had re
ceived money for competing or had
cheated others out of their just dues
! should be disqualified, but there are many
who cannot see why a man who has gone
down to Los Angeles, for example, and
run under an assumed name just for
fun should forever be debarred from cora
| peting with amateurs. And yet the rea-
I son is very simple when you look closely.
Among gentlemen everything should be
done in a manner above suspicion or re
proach. There must be no tricks of any
kind whatever. When a sentinel warns a
prisoner not to cross the dead line and
the man keeps far from it the sentry is at
i ease; but when the man begins to walk
I up and down on the dead line the soldier
looks to see if his cartridge is in order. If
you permit one man to enter a race under
' a false name you mu^t permit all to do so
â¢ if they feel so disposad, and then you
| would have endless confusion.
There is another point that will debar
a man very quickly from the amateur
ranks if he is detected in it, namely, re
ceiving a consideration for becomiug or
remaining a member of a particular club.
This does not apply to cases where nieu
have been admitted as members of clubs
and their initiation fee waived.
Not only can a man be debarred from
amateur contests ior entering under a
false name, but the same punishment
awaits the one who enters under a club
other than his own. However, I do not
know whether the court before which he
would appear would be as severe as in the
'other case unless they could prove or had
reason to suspect an intention to defraud.
There are a few other conditions which
must not be infringed upon if a young
man does not wish to bring himself under
the ban of the athlet c authorities. The
rules strictly prohibit eniering a contest
open to professionals, or wh it are called
"open competitions,' 1 that is, events that
are understood or advertised as open to all
comers without any restrictions. To enter
such a contest, even if the man did not
compete, would indicate a professional
spirit, lor it is to be supposed that hi 3
intention was to start and to win the
prize. As bpfore remarked, no one i 3
wanted in the amateur ranks who is not
an amateur at heart, and the object of
such a strict rule is to keep younsj men
away from the dead line. Let me not do
misunderstoodâ a gct>d rule is one thing,
the enforcement of it is another, and
someiimes the executive officers of athletic
law are derelict in their duty. However,
I am exceedingly glad to see the officers of
the Pacific Athlete Association so strict
and jus: in their rulings and enforcements
oi the lav.
Again, an amateur will be debarred for
competing with a professional in a private
race or contest lor a prize of any nature
whatever. I repeat, the object of the rule
is to keep the two classes us far apart as
possible. In a future issue I may devote
some space to explaining what relations
the amateur cau bear to the professional
witbou: being disqualified thereby.

ejNCE upon a time ever so long

â ft century, there lived a good
Bishop. History teils us that he was
made a martyr on account of his religious
beliefs by Claudius II on February 14,
A. D. ii"O. We aiso learn that the 15th of
February was a heathen lestive day called
"Februata Juno," and was the occasion of
mr.ch froiickiug and merry-making.
Finally, through the efforts of the
church, the people were persuaded to
ho:d their festivities on the 14th and to
give it the name of St. Valentine, instead
of that of the heathÂ»n goddess Juno, and
this is how it happens that the martyred
bishop's name is associated with a day
that for centuries has been devoted to
mirth and revelry almost the whole world
over.

tion with St. Valentine's day is the one

Do's Valentine.
BY AGKKS RErPLIHR.
{^T was certainly a wonderful valentine.
2 Not that you or I, perhaps, would
Ji have considered it anything remark
able, but to Do's tristful eyes, as she stood
gazing in the shop window, it seemed the
perfection of all that was beautiful.
There was a shepherdess tending her
sheep, with a crook tied with ribbons and
tiny little slippers on her tiny little feet.
And there was a shepherd lad lying in
the grass and playing on his flute for her
entertainment, while the lambs, frisking
gayly about, took core of themselves and
gave no trouble whatsoever.
A broad border of gold lace surrounded
this lovely valentine and Do stood look
ing at it admiringly, and wondering if
ever in ber life she would own anything
half so beautiful.
Poor little Do! Father and mother had
both died when she was a baby, and ever
sir.cc she could remember she had lived
with her Autit Betsy, in the big brick
hou-e ttiat seemed to her always the
gloomiest spot in the whole town. Not
that her aunt was poor, for the brick
house was both tall and bro.td, and Do
ha I all the comforts she required.
Her clothes were good, though so old
fashioned in their cut, and so somber in
their coloring, that the chinl, con-cious of
never looking lite other little gins, and
fancying, in her painful shyness, that they
were iaughing at her, shrank from their
society and became as lonely at school as
she was at home.
Her companions all agreed that she was
a little guy, because she wore an old
brown hood and a queer-looking brown
rloth cape, which might, as Corny Reeves
said, "have come out of the ark" ; and
they thought her a little eoose as well, be
cause she never seemed to know how to
play any games or make any friends for
herself. She could study her lessons well
enough, and that was about nil.
At home her aunt scareiy ever noticed
her. She did not mean to neglect her
dead brother's child in any way, and it
never occurred to ber that she was doing
Dorothyâ or Do, as she was calledâ was
warmly c.'ad, well feel and sent to tue best
BChool. That anything else was necessary
to make a sensitive little girl bappy was
an idea that did not piesent itself to ber
mind for a moment, and that, perhaps,
was just the reason that Do was gazing so
wistfully at the valentine in the shop win
dow.
It represented to her that kind of love
and pleasure which she knew entered into
other children's Jives, but which seemed
to be all left out of her .
"Just look a: Do Thornton staring at
the valentines!' said Bertie Rollins to his
sister, a3 they came down the street to
school. "Wonder if she expects to buy
any?"
"You had better send her one, I think,"
suegestert Grace.
"So I will â a comic one if 1 can get any
i that will suit. A girl dressed up like her
â  grandmother would be a good idea. She
! will never dream who sent it."
And the two children passed on their
way, leaving the solitary little figure still
absorbed in the beauties of the store win
dow.
But Do's eye 3 were not the only ones
that had espiel out and admired the
gold-bordered valentine. Bertie Roliins
i himself had been greatly struck by its
! gorgeousness, and had made up his mind
â¢ to send it to Katie Snow.
A vastly different child from Do Thorn
j ton was this same Katie Snow, with mis
j chief sparkling in her dark eyes, ana tne
! spirit of fun lurking always in the corners
ol her rosebud mouth. A merry, romping
beauty, who easily won the hearts of
! every boy and girl in the school, and,
| though willful and skittish as a kitten]
j yet managed to remain a general favorite
with all the teachers.
Bertie had long been devoted to ber,
dragging her home on his sled, presenting
her with odd oranges and pieces of chew

ing sum, and altogether showering on her
thosa attentions by wtiich a schoolboy ia
given to making known his admiration.
And now he was prepared to send her
that valentine if it took every cent of
pocket-money he owned, and Bertie was
generally very well supplied in this re
spect.
Sixty cents was the price, but the boy
paid it without winking and was about
iioingoutof the store when he remem
bered Do Thornton and the comic valen
tine he was to send her. The idea wa3
too good to be lost, and after looking over
the entire stock he selected one In which
a very woe-begone young woman, dressed
in garments more prim and stiff than a
Quaker's and with a huge poke bonnet on
her head, was warning other girls against
the vanity of dress and bidding them fol
low her wise and provident example.
Now, Bertie was not a cruel or even an
unkind boy, though he was ready to do
such an unkind thing. It never occurred
*.o him that such a jest was likely to
wound poor Do's sensitive little heart.
He did not mean to be ill-natured, but
then he had no right to be so, even with
out meaning it. A hundred such pictures
would not have hurt his feelings, and he
did not take the trouble to think bow dif
ferent the two cases were. And for my
part I do not consider that those
wretched colored daubs which are called
comic valentines are ever a pleasant joke.
For one that may be sent in pure fun a
dozen carry with them a spark of malice
and are received either with wounded
feelings or with anger; and when a jest
has any ill-nature about it it is best to let
it alone.
But Bertie was only a boy, and a heed
less boy at best, end without stopping to
think of tue consequences, he carried his
valentines home and directed the two
large envelopes in writing that was care
fully disguised. They were about the
same size and he dropped them in the
leitcr-box before ho went in to supper.
The next morning, at school, he kept
watching for the two little girls, and pretty
soon Do came along, her satchel on her
arm and her face looking unusually bright
and happy in its old brown hood. He felt
so curious that he could not forbear aj>k
in? a question wnich might easily betray
him.
"Hello, Do!" he called. "Did you get
any valentines this morning?"
She turned to him with flushed cheek
and sparkling eyes.
"Oh, Bertie!" she half whispered, "did
you really send it to me? And it is so
beautiful!"
"What is so beautiful?" asked the boy,
bewildered.
"The valentine," she answered, with a
smile that lit up strangely the sad little
face. "I wanted it so much, and I could
not think where it bad come from."
"Let's see it.' said Bertie, faintly, be
ginning to realize that something bad
gone wrong.
Do opened her sa tchel and carefully tooK
out a lar.Â°;e white envelope, with Mis 3
Djrothv Thornton written on it in
cramped characters, that ne recognized at
once.
From this she slowly drew a valentine
â no prim young woman, in a poke bon
net, however, but a well-known shep
herdess tendine her lambs, with ber
shepherd-boy lying in the grass at her
feet.
Bertie saw it all now. Was there ever
anything so stupid? In his hurry he had
slipped the two valentines into the wrong
envelopes, and Katie Snow had, before
this, received the ill-natured picture des
tined for Do Thornton.
Luckily, the direction was disguised and
she need never know who sent it. Sup
pose he should tell Do just how the thing
happened !
He glanced at her as this thought passed
through his mind, and was startled to see
how pretty she looked, notwithstanding
the brown hood and awkward brown cape.
ilerlips were parted in a pleased smile,
as :-he gazed at her treasure, and showed
a glimpse of tiny white teeth. Her blu_
eyes were fairly moist with delight.
"Did yon send it to me, Bertie?" she
asked again, with wistful eagerness.
A.nd not for worlds would the boy have
destroyed the happiness she felt.
"Yes, I sent it," he said, bluntly; "and
I am glad you like it so much." Then,
with tho straightforward friendliness of a
boy, he added, "And, look here. Do, if
you like, I'll take you home on my sled,
after school."
"If there isn't your brother Bertie drag-
King Do Thornton on his sled!" said
Corny Reeves to Grace, as they walked
home together.
"Ye?," said Grace, who was always
quick to follow in her brother's lead.
"He says she is a real nice eirl, and he
sent her that lovely valentine she has;
and I am going to ask her to my party
next week."
And that was the way Do began to make
friends. And, fie ice once brokan, it was
soon found out that she could play all
zames very well, and coul I be the gayest
ofthegav. And now there is no greater
favorite and no happier girl En the school
than shy, ill-dressed Do Thornton.
Golden Days.
Tracy's Comics
f^yCHOOL had just been dismissed
"* ntl tDe boys had nathered outside
â¢*â â # 3 to discuss plans for the coming
Valentine's night.
"You just bet we are going to l:ave
some sport," said Fred, one of the oldest
in the group. "I saw the greatest comic
valentine downtown, just the thing to
sand to teaciier."
"Tell us what it was," chorused all the
boys.
â¢"It was a fine comic," said Fred, "a pic
ture of an ugly old woman, and it was
called 'The Old Maid,' anil had a couple
of great verses. You see I thought it
would be a line thing for teacher, you
know she is so homely, and an old maid
too."
"Oh my, won't she 1 c mad," said Harry,
a mischievous - looking boy somewhat
younger than Fred.
"Oh, by the way," continued Harry, "I
saw a comic down in Tracy's store-window
that I think would be 'out of sight' for
Tom Atkins. "You know what a shabby
looking old coat that is he wears to school.
It Isn't a quarter big enough and it's all
patches. The comic was called 'The
Seed}' Man,' ami I couldn't help but grin
when I saw how much the picture looked
like Tom. Won't he be wild when we gi7e
a ring at hisdocrbeil and he gets that?"
"Tracy has a lot of the funniest comic
valentines in town this year," said one of
the other boys, "and when we buy ours
we'll have great fun taking them round,
ringing the doorbells and theu running
round the corner."
"I say, fellers," said Fred, "it's getting
late now and to-morrow night is Valen
tine's, so we'd all better go home, get our
money and meet on the corner at 5 o'clock.
Then we'll go down to Tracy's and pick
out the ones we wish." So the little group
separated, all the boys going their several
ways., thinking gayly of the fun that was
in store.
But Burt, one of the boys who had been
listening to the plans for Valentine's
night, walked slowly and thoughtfully
toward home. He was a jolly boy, gen
erally, the li c of ail the fun at school, but
when Fred spoke of sending that comic to
Miss Parsons, the teacher, liurt felt some
how as though it wouldn't be the thing.
He remembered how willing she was to
explain over and over again the knotty
problem or the lesson that was hard to
understand. He remembered how his
mother had told him once the *ecret of
that sad look in her eyes, the story of her
lonely life. He didn't suppose all the
boys knew and he didn't feel like telling,
but he did wish he could do something to
prevent Miss Parsons from getting that
kind of a valentine. Yet, as he said to
himself, "1 don't want to spoil the fun, so
I'll go to the corner at 5."
The appointed hour tound the boys on
the corner, all but Fred, who failed to put
in an appearance.
"Where on earth can he be?" said
Harry. "He told us to meet here at 5
o'clock sharp, and now be isn't here him
self."
The boys had not lons* to wait, however.
Down the street Fred came, breathlessly
running, waving his arms frantically in
the air and calling to ihe boys with all
the power of strong, healthy lungs.
"Oh, there's been an accident on the
train â it was almost wrecked, bin it
wasn't, and Tom Atkins did itâ saved it
from the washout, 1 mean â and they're
bringing him in now on the train. He's
killed, I guess, or if he isn't he's pretty
near it!"
"Come on, fellers, let's go and see." said
Harry. Off the boj'B scampered for tne
depot as fast as their sturdy young limbs
could carry them. Jusi as they got there
the big engine swung around the curv-*
and came slowly into the depot, drawing
a long train of passenger coaches.
The news that there had been a washout
on the road and that the train would have
been wrecked if it hadn't been for Ton:
Atkins had spread rapidly through the
town and a large crowd had gathered at
the depot long before the boys' arrival.
"There he is! There he is! ' said Fied,
as several meu carefully alighted, gently
lifting a hastily improvised stretcher upon
which poor Tom lay.
"How did it happen? How was he
hurt?" was heard on every band.
The story was soon told. Tom had been
out on the hills hunting for tiie first
spring wiidttower-, where he went each
year to gather them to sell to the city
trade. But the reins had been tin usually
heavy and the few blossoms that were
brave enough to lift their heads above the
water-soaked earth looked wind-blown
and strangely desolate.
"They will never do," said Tom, in a
hopeless voice. Tom was in the habit of
talking to himself, as those are apt to do
who know little of true human compan
ionship.
It was a keen disappointment to Tom,
for no one knew how much he needed the
O DOLLY, dolly darling !
O dolly, dolly mine!
They laugh because I tell them
That you are my Valentine.
They think that I should have, dear,
A doll in place of you;
Now|don't be frightened, dolly,
For that's what I'll never do,
1 know your nose is melted;
I know one eye is gone;
My father said this morning
That you r.ally were forlorn.
But that's the very reason
Why you should always be
The very dearest dolly
In the whole round world to me.
If mv nose should get broken,
If I looked queer and wild,
Would my mamma exchange me
For another brand-new child?
HELEN MARSTON in Our Little Ones and the Nursery.
money he hoped to gain by the sale of the
flowers.
Tom's father had died years before, and
his mother was weak and worn from the
struggle of the years.
Tom started for home along the railroad
track after his fruitless search.
Ju^ as he reached a turn in the road he
saw tnat the nun had caused a heavy land
slide across the track.
Tom had hardly time to think before he
heard in tho distance the heavy rumble of
the approaching train.
What was to he done? Tom ran wildly
down the track toward the train.
And then he thoujrht of his old worn
jacket â the one the boys made such fun
of. It had been warmly lined with bright
red flannel, for the want of something
better.
Hastily pulling It off, Tom waved it
frantically at the approaching train.
Seeing the red Hagâ the signal of dan
cerâthe engineer applied the brakes.
Tom, in his excitement, stood still on
the track. The engineer shouted, but tlie
nervous strain had begun to tell, and Tom
did not hear.
On came the train, and before it could
be stopped it had knocked poor Tom
down and dragged him some little dis
tance.
Kind hands lifted him from the track
and bore him into the train and onward
toward home.
"A badly broken leg," the doctor said,
as Tom was carried into bis humble home.
"He never thought of his own danger,'
the people whispered, with moistened
eyes.
"Boys," said Burt, as they witnessed
the mother's urief in the little poverty
stricken home, ''he will live, the doctor
says. Let's buy Tom some dowers to look
at when He is sickâ tie lov s them, so his
mother saysâ and some other little thinsts
he need 9 instead of the 'comics.' What
do you say, fellers?' 1
And what they said you can guess when
I tell you that Tracy put bis comic valen
tines away for another Valentine day,
vainly wondering why the boys didn't
seem to care for comics this year.

From Tom to Dorothy.
A VALENTINE.
Your eyes! oh.ivy! 1 wish I could
Of all their beauties write;
They're just the loveliest, fairest blue-
In fact they're "out of sight" ;
And when you're glad they shine and dance
In such a merry way,
And when you're sal they always look
So dreamy, far-away.
Your hair is tied with ribbon bows
Just l:ke the other girls',
But not a one of them can boast
Such lovely goid'-'n curls;
And when m school the sun comes 'round
And shines upon your hair
I Know the angels never had
A halo half so lair.
And whÂ»n you smile! oh, Dorothy,
My heart goes pit-a-pat
Till, as the boys all say with truth,
I don't know "where I'm at."
And I am foolish, ye*. I know,
To writ.' such words io you;
But when I love you such a lot,
What am 1 going to do?

Dear Editor: Yesterday the seventh grade of
our school had as our gr.i inmar lesson to write
a letter to one of our friends, cousins or clnss
roates, but some of us did not have anybody
to write to, so our teacher said that we might
write to the San Francisco Call. Our school
is a fine two-story building, with four hand
some rooms, besides a library-room. We also
have a nice windmill and tank and plenty of
playground for exercise and fun. The build
ing is situated in Washington Colony, which
is quite large and contains a nice plautation,
with many kinds of fruit trees and a large
field of grain. When the flowers are in bloom
and the green leaves have opened it is very
lovely around the colony. We have a little
town here by the name of Easton, which is six
miles from Fres'io and has one store, one
blacksmith-shop, three churches and one bank
ing house. I will close my letternow, as I have
no more to tell about our schoolhouse or our
colony. Yours truly,

âºNeW Idea for Raising S\jr\ker\ Vessels.

iJWy.N ingenious invention for raising
vj*l-V sunken wrecks, which has just
â¢J[X*ij'D' en invented by Felix Gailiard, a
Frenchman of Bordeaux, is beginning to
attract considerable attention in the
marine world as well as among wreckers
and divers.
The device is so very simple and at the
same time constructed upon principles
which have so long been thoroughly
" familiar to every schoolboy that the only
wonder is why it was not applied long
â  ago.
From his experience as a practical
diver, Mona. GaiUard early in bis career
knew and appreciated the numerous
difficulties encountered in raisine wrecks!
by the slow and laborious method of sink- j
ing caissons, binding them io the liul! '
and slow.y raising it to the surface where !
' the water* could be pumped out of the hull :
â¢ and the work of repair done.
Often, when thisdillicuU task was nearly
completed and the wreck was almost at
t!ie surface, a slight leak in one of the j
cai-sons would allow the hull to sink back j
to tne bottom aim the work would have to j
be done all over again.
'. ' At such times Gailiard wished most de- ;
voutlv that some other means of wreck- j
raisine could be devised, but as no one !
appeared to be able to produce the much- :
. -Jonged-ior invention he set about devising
Â«;ie liimseif.
V As a hoy he had been familiar with the ,
Â¥ . i] le by which when an inverted cuu,/
r ed beneath the surface of the water
.'â  the air pressure within the vessel keeps it :
: dry and prevents the water from filling it.
Tins was the first idea of the French in- â 
ventor, and it is the fundamental princi- ;
pie pf the perfected Gaiilard systWÃ of
wrrcr-raising.
Simple as is the method as applied by
the inventor, it took long months to make
the theory practicable. Both time and
. money were required, ar.d while he had
almost too much of the former, there was
a lamentable scarcity of funds until a
. number of financially solid wrecking
. companies became interested in the mat
ter and furnished Gailiard with the ntces
. sary capital with which to carry on his
work.
The result of this work is simply a nuru
bit of waterproof bags made in the shape
ol huge cylinders or pipes, long tubes!
which connect these bags with a powerful !
air pump and some stout pieces of canvas j
. and chains.
That is the entire invention, complete !
and ready lor service, yet it represents |
long hours of thought as well as days and â 
weess of work which were necessary be- \
hire the persistent inventor could, go to
, . tnose who had furnished him the money ;
with which to carry on the work and say
with- certainty: "I have completed and
perfected my plans and machine for rais
ing wrecks."
The air pumps used in this wrecking ua
t.'iine are much more powerful than the.
ordinary kind, and are carried in the stern !
.of stanch ocean-going tugs, capable o?
withstanding any kind of weather, and
which are iurnished with engines of the j
'. most powerful construction.
T.;e engines in the^e tugs are so ar- j
ranged that whenever it is desired they
can be connected with the air pumps and
used to force air through them, while the
tug remains stationary.
The air is lorced fir-t through draught- !
pipes into a huge bellows-like arrange
ment made of steel, wood, canvas and
leather, and re-enforced at every possible
â¢ point with a double thickness of each ma- ;
tefial. It is circular in :o:m and held in I
position between two horizontal steel- i
plates which are connected by powerful
Bcrewa.
When the air is forced into the drum it
naturally expands and forces the two
â¢â teel plates, between wnich it is held,
.â ipart. After it has been completely filled
with air the huge screws which connect i
the rim 3of the plates are turned by the j
engines, and by screwing the two steel |
plates together a powerful pressure is
brought to Lear and tne air within the
drum is forced out through the pipes
which lead to the cylinder-like bag's and
the large main pipe which forces the j
water from the sunken hull. Automatic j
valves prevent the air being forced back !
through the pump.
When a wreck is to be raised by this !
method, the car^o, if there is any, is first
removed and a tug supplied with air
pumps, bags and the rest of the equip- !
ment is sent to the place where the ship i
went down and anchored a little to one
"HIS HOUSE-OWNER LAUGHS AT ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANIES.
side, so as not to be directly over the spot
wnere the bull lies.
On the tup is carried a complete diver's
outfit, and when the boat comes to an
" ttior the diver is bent down to the bottom
to make the preliminary arrangements for
â¢ raiding; the wreck.
When the disaster has been occasioned
by a collision or by striking a submerged
reef and He ship has siid back into deep
water, there are holes in the hull to be re
â¢ paired belore anything can be done to
>*ard bringing the craft to the surface.
It is hero that the large pieces of canvas
which are a portion of the outfit *re in
dispensable. With them the diver patches
'.. as tightly as possible the holes in thehu:l.
and at tne same timeopensall the hatches
: of the sunken ship and makes fast within
â¢ the hull the lar^e main pipes which con
nect with ti e huge air drum on the tug.
That much being accomplished, the next
step toward the raising 19 to make fast to
the hull in the securest possible manner
the numerous cylindrical bags. Tneseare
! sent down to the diver, who, with chains,
binds them aiong the keel on either side.
' These bags are connected Oy stout pipes
' with the air pump above, and when all aie
: made fast the powerful machinery of the
j tug connecting with the pump is set in
j motion.
As the bags gradually nil with air unfier
: the influence of the powerful pressure
j from above, they exert a lifting power on
the null which is not to bo resisted.
Gradually the huge frame is completely
: turned over and eventually rests on the
bottom of she sea upside down, the air in
: the bags being of sufficient buoyancy to
i keep it in position.
Meantime, theÂ»large main pipes which
! were first made fast inside the hull have
: not been idle, and as the lowerful and
; steady current of air is forced through
! them into the hull, the water is gradually
forced out. and lignt buoyant air takes the
place of tne heavier water.
As the air pressure increases the hull
: becomes ligh;er and r:aes toward the sur
face. Air being constantly iorced into the
; hull and the bags strapped along the Keel,
J the pressure is maintained and the water
' kept out on exact.'y the same principle
that it is kept from filling the inverted
cup held under water.
In addition to turning the hull upside
[do-vn be:ore it is emptied of water, the
bags ranged along the keel also serve the
purpose of keeping the craft in the proper
position while k is being raised through
the water.
Strange as it may appear, the proper
position for the craft during the process is
keel up. Were this position not main
tained the ship would naturally right her
self and again fill and sink, thus undoing
all the work of the wreckers.
Once the ship is at the surface it is a I
comparatively easy matter to maintain i
ihe air pressure wnile the hull is towed to i
; the nearest drydock.
As long as the air pressure is maintained
within the hull the ship cannot sink, and
once in ttie dryiiock it is easy to ri^ht her
; and place her in a position to make the
! necessary repairs.
By tbe use of the Gailiard system, as it
j is called, of wreck-raising almost all the
; disadvantage* under which wreckers have
\ heretofore labored are obv.at^il. All of
| the hard and laborious work is done by
| the air bags and the air within the hull.
; There are no ponderous cranes or derricks
1 to be moved about, and the very simplicity
I of the whole arrangement is what recom
\ mends it most forcibly to wreckers and
I uivers.
Spiders ir\ the /Xir.
In a communication to Knowleige on
j "Spiders," Rev. Samuel Barber discusses
at some length the phenom-non of the
flo:ation line and its metlud of attach
! ment, which is the foundation of t c
j spider's web. Is it not evident, a*ks the
reverend gentleman, that air â and prob-
I ably at a high temperature â must be in
closed within the meshes of the substance
forming the line when it passes from the
SDinnerots into the atmosphere? T.'.e
creature with this substance lifts it into
the air. It has been usual to explain tt.e
ascent by the kite principle, namely, the
mechanical lorce of the contiguous atmos- |
phere, but air movements, especially on a
small ?caie. are so capr.cious an i uncon
trollable that without a directive force the
phenomena seem quite inexplicable.
In sui>i>ort of this th ory of a direct pro
pelling force, Mr. Barber gives some of
his own observation*. Writing one day
with two slieeis of quarto b fora him he
saw a spider on the paper, and in
order to test iis t>ower of pacing through
the air he held one of the sheets of paper
about a foot from that oa which the crea
ture was run .imp. It ascended to the
ed c ar.d vanished, but in a moment it
landed upon the other sheet through mid
air, in a horizontal direction, and picked
up the thread a^ it advanced. In this case
there was no air movement to facilitate,
nor any time to throw a line upward,
which, indeed, would not have solved the
difficult}'. On another occasion, at a din
ner party in Kent, four canules were
lighted oa the table, when a thread was
seen to be strung from the tip of one of
the lighted candies and attached to an
other about a yard off, and all the four
lichts were connected in this way, and
that by a web drawn quite tight.
The only explanation which Mr. Barber
can suggest for this remarkable occurrence
is that the spinner was suspended at firm
by a vertical line from above, ana thus
swayed itself to and fro. from tip to tip of
the candles. It was certain the spider
could not have ascended from the table,
and it was equally certain that aerial flota
tion of the line from a fixed point was im
possible, as it involved floating in four op
posite directions. The rapidity with nhich
the initial movements in forming a web
are made cannot be reconciled with any
theory of a simple atmospheric convec
tion and propulsion appears the only ex
planation. â New York Mail and Express.

CYLINDRICAL AIR CAISSONS CAPSIZING THE WRECK.
JUST PUT A WINDMILL ON YOUR HOUSETOP
Jhen you Gar\ Harness Old Boreas to Electra, Brilliantly Illumi
nate your Home ar\d Laugh ir\ your SleeVe at
Electric Light Companies
?!|?SL HE first successful attempt to put to
k'l^ practical use an electric plant run
jlls by a windmill has ju*t been accom
plished by J. J. Feely, a well-known law
yer of Walpole, Mass., wi'.h a penchant
for mechanics.
With wind as the fundamental factor,
this lawyer-mecbanic-:nventor operate* a
private light plan t, forces water all over
his estate, operates farm machinery, cuts
wood, turns iathes and fills storage bat
teries tor use in horseless carriages.
It was no easy task which Mr. Feely set
himself out to accomplish when he under
took to develop this "windmill electric
plant" for his own use on his ample
private estate.
From an electrician's point of view the
greate-t obstacle, and one which it was
claimed could not be overcome, was tho
vanaoility of the wind and the consequent
erratic fluctuations of the electric pres
sures which rendered their utilization im
possible by subjecting the ordinary
mechanical connections to excessive and
fatal strains.
Early in bis experiments, Mr. Feelv
found that one of the first problems to be
solved was to determine accurately the
wind velocities and efficiencies during the
various months of the year.
This was determined by the use of an
anemometer made especially for that
particular purpose and very similar to
ttiose in use by the United States \Wather
Bureau, with the exception that whil* the
Government instruments record the mile
rate of wind the one made for Mr. Fee.y
recorded tho wind at each fiftieth of a
mile.
After some months of hard thinking,
and harder work, the machinery with all
its improvements was finally set in place,
and wnen a 1 connections were made Mr.
Feely anxiously awaited the first trial,
which thould demonstrate the failure or
success of his pains and labor.
The windmill proper is the ordinary
wind, common in all out-of-town and
(ountry places where there is no pubjic
water supply. The frame, or supports,
extend fi:ty feet above the second story of
the stables, as shown in tne plclure.
At the top of this frame are the wheel
and fan, which are operated by the wind.
As the wheel revolver under the influence
of the slightest breeze it operates a series
of cogwheels which work upon a long
vertical -haft running from the head of
the machine to the basement or cellar of
the stable, where it communicates with a
second shaft leading directly to the dynamo
of the plant.
From this dynamo lead two sets of wires.
One set carry the current to the various
parts of the estate, where it is utilized or
power purposes and for lighting, while
the other set of wires receive the surplus
current and store it in storage batteries,
for use when the fickle wind is not suffi
ciently strong to give power enough to
supply the necessary voltage.
Wnen there is a high wind there is
naturally a much stronger current than is
necessary, and in order that it may not
be wasted or play havoc with the lights
the surplus energy is led into these
storage batteries and there kept until
ne< <le !.
A feature of this dynamo is that the
same one wbic i g 'iieraie* the current
wiien there is a breeze aiso acts as a motor
â¢luring a cam and can be use! with the
energy always on hand in the storage
batteries. This double service by a dy
namo has never before been accomplished.
In the comparatively light breeze wh.ch
wai b owing when the first trial was
made the wheel of the windmill began to
slowly revolve, then faster and faster it
went until it looked iike one solid piece of
circular wood spuming about in the air.
A number of electric lights had been put
up in the stab c as a test, and when these
were turned on after the windmill had
been workin ' some time they showed a
brilliant, steady light, the equal of that
supplied by any electric-ligtu company in
the country.
The experiment was a success, and a
combination of windmill and motor had
been found at such a comparatively slight
cost that the matter of expense was hardly
worth consi lering.
Once the practicability of the machinery
was assured Mr. Feely lost no time in
putting electric lights throughout his
house and stub es and about his private
grounds an<i utilizing the new agency for
various honsehoid and farm purposes.
The wiiole Becret of the success of his
work is in the dynamo, which in a num
ber of ways is different from the usual
electric dynamo. In an ordinary dynamo
the voltage depends upon the speed with
whirh its ariuaiure is driven, ami it was
found that owinn to the various speeds at
which the windmill was driven an ordi
nary dynamo would be entirely useless
for such purposes as Air. Feely intended;
hence it was necessary to construct the
special one.
In devising such a dynamo three things
were essential. It must be self-regulatine,
free from nil mechanical contrivances,
and above all it must be efficient.
The seli-regulating part of the requi
sites was accomplished by a peculiar and
somewhat complicated arrangement of its
integral parts and not by any mechanical
addition. It required no little thought
and many trials to eventually accomplish
this end, but it was final y done and,
moreover, it was done without add ng to
or taking anything Irom ihe machine.
When the dynamo was tried it was
found to work perfectly. By keeping the
voltage constant it was found that sub
stantially all the power of the windmill,
however erratic, could be utilized by
simply increas.ng the current in propor
tion to the increase of the speed of the
windmill.
During his experiments in ascertaining
the varying changes la the velocity of the
wind Mr. Feely found that there 13 not as
great a difference as <s generally supposed
between winter and summer wind?.
During the midsummer months he
found that the wind averaged eight miles
an hour, while during the winter months
the average was about nine miles an hour.
One of the most important features of
this new contrivance is what is called a
speed equalizer of special construction by
rrhicb. the surplus energy generated by
nigh winds is mechanically stored ami de
livered to the batteries in a comparatively
uniform manner.
As it is neceasary that a dynamo must
attain a sufficent velocity to give an
electro-motive force sufficient to overcome
the back electro-motive force of tae bat
tery it was therefore necessary to devise
some means of preventing the current
from the storage battery passing back to
the dynamo when not needed.
This was accomplished by a devic?
which, when the electro-motive force oi
the dynamo rose to a given point, would
connect with the circuit, thereby sending
it into the storage battery and again open
ing the circuit, when, owing to decreasing
speed of the dynamo, the electro-motive
force falls below that of the storage bat
tery.
In every way this windmill electric
plant has proved itself a success even
under the most varying conditions. The
lights in the house, stable and those scat
tered about in different parts of the es
tate burn as steadily as any electric lights,
maintaining an unvarying uniformity, no
matter whether there is a gale blowing or
a dead calm.
The entire plant is as nearly self-acting
as it is possible to make machinery, abso
lutely no attention being necessary except
once in two weeks, when it is cleaned and
oiled.
The first cost is practically all the ex
pense, and following this example tbe
time is not far distant when private elec
tr.c light plants operated by wind will be
the property of every owner of a country
estate when a iartze number of lights are
desirable.

THE JAPANESE LUNCHEON FAD
Latest Unique Function of Society â No
Masculine Quests Wanted â Brilliant
Effects by Dainty Dames
eNEW fad has seized on society. It
-.liLLy is a Japanese luncheon. Not an
â I^'Lj invitation affair at which the er
ra.ic pictures on the time-honored bamboo
and silk paper fans are reiigiou-lv fol
lowed and t c ladies sit around on chairs
and chat of the latest scandal, but a bona
tide Jap lunch where meals fit to =et before
the Empress of Japan are served and the
ladies appear in genuine suso-moyos im
ported for the occasion from the realm of
the Mikado. '1 '{'.i ".' ..;â 
Thesf odd luncheons have in some mys
terious way, and for no apparent reason,
sprung into popularity with the younuer
set of the Four Hundred, out unlike many
of the recent popular fada they are actu
ally interesting.
In arranging for one of these entertain
ments the opportunity offered for pictur
esque effect is utilized by the hostess to
the utmost, many striking decorations be
ing used.
The rooms are made to represent as
nearly as possible a typical Japanese inte
rior. The angular and formal Western
furniture is hidden behind tall screens
reac ing from the floor almost to the ceil
ing, and these, with the ex rcise of a little
skill and tact in arrangement, can be made
to resemble thegayly pictured sliding walls
of a Japanese room.
Silk paper umbrellas are opened and
hune about the ceiling, very effectually
concealing ail traces of the calciminer's
handiwork and such incongruous features
as the elaborate nanging chandelier and
electric lights.
Bamboo hangings are arranged before
the doors and are placed over all the win
dows, while about the floors are scattered
0 iental rugs, worked in designs which
could not possibly be evolved from any
but a true and patriotic Japanese mind.
To make the luncheon a success the
most minute details are followed, even to
the extent of removing all chairs and
seats, their places being taken by tiny
stools and an abundance of soft, downy
cushions upon which the ladies find ac
coramoJatione in true Japanese style,
sitting a la Turk or reclining in a com
fortable but decidedly negligee fashion.
It ia perhaps needless to say right here
that the masculine element of society is
as strictly barred from participation in
these unique luncheons as from the harem
of a good Mohammedan, hence the absolute
freedom which the fair imitators of the
women of the island kingdom enjoy.
Tho curio shops are thoroughly ran
sacked for odds and ends of Japanese art,
and if no other purpose is accomplished
by the fad it has at least the <ff >ct of dis-
Beminatlng among the ladies of the swll
set a more thorout;h and exact knowledge
of Japanese methods, manners and cus
toms than they ever knew before.
Tables, as understood by the more push
ing and practical American mind, are as
strictly tabooed as are chairs. The pictur
esque substitutes, which are dainty little
lacquered stands about ten inches high,
are lully as convenient for the uses in
tended, and. somehow, a dainty meal of
urrknown foreign delicacies, with all sorts
of peculiar but not unpleasant flavors,
served from these tiny stand?, tastes much
better than if placed before one on a prac
tical, coldly dignified mahogany.
One of the most delightful and pictur
esque eff c's at those luncheons is ob
tained by tho varied colors and costumes
worn by the ladies.
For the information of those who
lack training in the mysteries of the
language of the M.kado's subjects it may
De said thai the suso-moyo, in which all
the ladies appear, means dinner dress, or,
as it is literally translated, auso-edge,
moyo-pat'ern.
The suso moyo is a long dross of silk
crepe, reaching from the neck to the feet
and trailing at the back.
Around the waist is worn the obi or
satin sash, which is one of the moat im
portant portions of the feminine raiment.
It is wound several times around the body
and in a Japanese lady's costume it takes
the place â pardon the word â of the corset
of her Western sister. It is tied at the
SOCIETY GIRLS INDULGING IN THEIR NEWEST ARTISTIC FAD.
back with a huge daring bow, while that
portion which is displayed in front is
elaborately embroidered in gold and sil
ver tracery and colored silks. It tak>-s
the average society- young woman some
time to master the intricate manner of
wearing the costume, but it is essential to
the success of t c Japan lunch.
The trailing etige of the suao-moyo is
also gay with ingrain patterns and gold
and silver tracery, which heips to give the
garment its name, moyo, meaning, as we
have said, pattern or tracery.
About the neck of the properly dressed
lady is worn the han-yeri, or collar. It is
a very elaborate affair of silk or satin,
heavy with embroidery and delicate pat
terns worked in many colors or gold and
| silver, as the tnste of the wearer may
elect or her rank in life warrant.
Over all is worn the ha-o-ri or coat with
! large flowing sleeve*, which is as much
the pride of a Japanese lady as is the bon
net to a Fifth-avenue dame of colonial de
scent. For matrons the only permissible
color of the ha-o-ri is sedate black, but
unmarriea ladies take delight in arraying
themselves in three and four
or live ha-o-ns of different colors, and the
combination is always pleasing.
The ha-o-ri also serves the purpose of
showing the rank of tho wearer. On each
| shoulder aiul at a point directly between
1 in the back of the garment three circular
holes are cut out in the fabric, and upon a
background of different colored material
from that of the cloak the heraldic device
of the lady's family is worked in colored
I silks.
The most difficult part of the costume
for the American imitator to wear ai:d to
accustom herself to are the curious san
dals, which are nothing but thick felt
soles raised from contact with the floor by
small blocks of wood fastened to the lower
side, hut even this difficulty has in many
instances been overcome, and more than
one Fifth-avenue belle can, if the truth
were known, move about as gracefully
upon the little Jap sanuals ai she can in
the daintiest ball slippers.
Above all is the curious little round
gjiyly colored skull cap with a single
feather stuck in the very center for no ap
parent reason except to look ludicrous.
Not a single detail is omitted and the
transformation of the society woman into
a lady of the Mikado's realm la perfect.
â  Thus arrayed and lounging at ease about
the Japanese room, the ladies who are in
tent upon following the dictates of Dame
Fashion are prepared for what is the
crowning feature of the affair.
That is the luncheon. And such a
spread. Hui-nio-no is followed by yaki
zakana and o'sashimi, or if not a very ex
tensive Ui:ich by chawanmori and then
comes kuchitorl-mono, which being ren
dered into English means sweets, while
all throughout the meal o'cha or "the
very best tea" is served ad libitum.
The sui-mo-no is the soup, preferably of
I chicken and vegetables, chopped very fine
and served in dainty china bowls coloied
j in fanciful designs. The boiled fish or ni
zakana is not quite so popular as some of
the lighter dishes such as o'sas-h inn, which
is very delicate and palatabl?, but the dis
creet hostess does not, as a rule, tell her
friends that it is highly spiced and flavored
fish, cnt in very thin 6Lces, freed from all
; bone and served raw.
The only English equivalent for chawan
mori is patties, the dish itself being a
baked combination of eggs and the meat
of shellfish such as crabs or lobsters,
minced and served as a side dish.
For the more elaborate Japanese lunch
eons tha wise hostess secures the services
of a Japanese cook for the occasion, but
many a quiet luncn ot this kind is served
by ladies to a select few, where tne cook
ing is done by "my lady" herself, who
tates pride in serving the dishea in true
Japanese style.
Each guest has one of the tiny four
legged stands â more like a doil's table
ilian anything else â placeJ before her,
and on this the meal is served, tne lady
sitting on a mat or cushion, as the indi
vidual may fancy.
These Japaneso luncheons are decidedly
popular with society ladies who have
weaned of the monotony of afternoon
teas and matinee lunches. It is a novel
experience and a new sensation to step
from the hurly-burly of every-day met
ropolitan life into the quiet and freedom
of a Japanese reception-room, where for
mality is banished together with chairs
ax.d tables and picturesque simplicity
takes the place, for the time being, of the
everlasting and ever-varying diplomacy
of society.

the beach ; in fact, that they were smaller
and more insignificant than the pebbles
of to-day.
When one has got thoroughly imbued
with these ideas it is a terrible blow to
nineteenth century pride to see a play
like "Spartacus." Diortio! which is the
original of dear me, what scarecrows
those supers looked in toga?, and most of
tbe principals had the same iean and
hunery look about their limbs. Muscular
development, indeed. Louis James and
Guy Lindsley were the only men who
had any muscular development to admire.
As for Miss Alma Kruger, she is a very
beautiful young lady, but her angular
arms were never designed for classic
draperies. If the average every- day
Roman had not been a finer specimen of
humanity than the average every-day
super, togas would never have remained
in fashion a week in ancient Rome.
Somehow those supeis in "Spartacus"
worried me. Tney all seemed designed
by nature <o play the role of the lean
apothecary in "Romeo and Juliet"^ and
not one of them knew enough about act
ing to "bear a banner in a stern, impres
sive manner." The arena scene was made
more picturesque by the presence of young
lady super?, who looked pleasant in the
boxes. \Vhen the gladiators cried havoc
and let loose the dogs of war the young
ladies never moved a muscle. They saw
their fellow-Romans thrown in the sind
of the arena and the gladiators sweeping
all before them, but they smiled on bland
ly, just as if they were rosing to be photo-
graphed. The conduct of those maidens
was the touch of unreality which de
stroyed the illusion of an otherwise very
thrilling scene. It is, no doubt, an almost
superhuman task to make supers act, or
else more stage managers would see that
they did it; but wouid it be impossible to
Diake those girls give some siens of terror
and dismay?
"Spartacas" is a very fine vehicle for
Louis James to show bis mastery over the
toga style of acting. He looks a fine
figure of a man and declaims bis bom
bustle lines in a manly, heroic way. He
has shown his sincerity, too, by spending
a good deal of money in mounting tlie
drama picturesquely, but as far as gen
eral popularity la concerned it was money
thrown away. For thesake of seeing one
or two hero.c roles finely interpreted, fin
de siecle audiences will not flock to a p.'ay
like "Spartacus." Dr. Bird tried to ap
peal to a whole gamut of emotionsâ love
of liberty, patriotism, maternal, paternal
and fraternal cffec.ion, etc. âbut there is
a hollow, artificial ring about most of bis
fine sentiments that does not deceive the
sophisticated playgoer of to-day. Two
decades ago the ; -end of tbe drama was
not toward realism, and thank Heaven
we do Dot all of us now belong to the
Ibsen, Hanptman, Maeterlinck, Pinero
cult, but their "cheap, tawdry, bilious
logic" (as Lyman B. Glover calls it) has
made us skeptical about guilelessly ac
cepting the highfalutin' notions that two
decades ago playgoers seem to have
thoueht very fine sentiments indeed.
When William Gillette sat down to
write "The Professor" he must have been
uncertain whether to produce a farce
comedy, a melodrama or a tender, roman
tic play, so he compromised by giving
them all in layer*, like a ham and veal
sandwich. Layer No. 1, where the pur
blind Professor proposes to every girl be
meets, is broad farce-comedy. Melodrama
makes its appearance in the second act
with tne entrance of the vi;lairÂ» Brown,
one of those husky-voiced, unwashed,
out-and-out ruffians who steal infants of
tender years and bully and abuse ihcir
ill-gotten prey. If there had been any
doubt as to whether Brown hud escaped
from melodrama it would nave been set
at rest when the Professor felled him to
the earth with one blowâ in the presence
of ladies the hero of melodrama always
rinds one blow sufficient to lay the villain
low. Tbe third layer of "The Professor"
lapses into tender sentiments, and before
parting with bis audience â just to snow
that there is no ill-feelingâ Gillette gives
them a second slice of broa l farce-comedy,
i:i which the Professor is bombarded with
pseudo Jove-letters from a lot of mis
chievous boys and gir.s, and cries wildly,
1 Lemme go! 1 ' Â»nd bounds through a win
dow to escape, after wnicb, seeing that no
one is making the faintest effort to detain
him, he remains.
These little ups and downs in tbe style
of "Tlie Professor' 1 give the members of
the Alcazar Company plenty of opportuni
ties fjr showing their versatility. J. B.
Polk, as the hero, is a fine specimen of the
P'.-datzo-'ic walking encyclopedia of useless
knowledge, and as Daisy Brown, the child
of the woods, Miss Bertha Foitz is de
lightfully clever and lifelike. She looks
the mere slip of a girl that Daisy is sup
posed to be, and she acts bcr part with ail
tbe unconscious vim and abandon of a
f rant- hearted child-woman.
Seeing is believing, and a great many
people had to see "Chimmie Fadden" at
the Columbia 10 be convinced that Town
send's rambling, discursive sketches had
been welded into a coherent play. En
thusiasts who like to be in the swim con
sider it rank heresy to utter a word
against anything written in the jargon of
the Howeryâ the spot which seems rapidly
becoming tbe clearest to every American
heart. Tbe veriest twaddle written in tbe
Bowery jargon is hailed as inspired, and
the commonest type of Bowery coaracter
is gazed at (on tbe stage) with an admira
tion approaching to awe. For my partâ
I loathe dialect stories, and only
read some of Townsend's sketches as peo
ple take tonics and constitutionals, be
cause they are supposed to be invicorat
ingâwhen I have to pronounce four or rive
words on every pai?e aloud to guess at tbe
meaning, as most people have to do in
dialect stories, I never can help deploring
The wicked waste of time taken by the au
thor to write tbe dialect only to give hie
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1897.
readers "double doublo toil and trouble"
in trying to decipher it.
The succes of the "Chimraie Fadden"
sket iies really lay in the fact that beneath
the Bowery jurgon and the author's
ram-jlinu style he had made carefully
studied types of toiifjh character. Town
send was fortunate in finding a clever
collaborator to assist in sorting his char
acters and applying them to stage pur
poses, and tre result of their joint labors
is a play wb'cb bristles with interesting
types and quaint language, (bough i(s
great fascination lies in the fact that tbe
Bowery is written ail over it.
If t:.e present passion for Bowery lit
erature and Bowery songs continues it
may come to pass that two thousand
years hence, when intelligent Japanese
tourists fly over to visit the silent ruins of
New York, the students of dead languages
will say to their guides: "Don't show us
the vulgar ruins of Wall street, of Fifth
avenue; there is no literature connected
with them. We want to muse by moon
light in tbe classic Bowery."

News comes from Los Angeles that ii
consequence of Modje-ka's sudden illness
there was no performance on Wednesday
night, and the great actress' condition has
since been such as to make tne abandon
ment of the tour an absolute necessity.
It was intended to end the tour in Oak
land on Thursday, Friday and Saturday,
and the advance bookings were very lieavy.
Yesterday, however, all the money was re
fuudea, as there is no hope of Modjeska
JYlonster Benefit.
Arrangements are beinz completed for
a monster benefit in aid of the Actors'
Fund of America, to take place at the

curing the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect po!n s of equal air pressure; iso
therms. or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to. low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
. coast. When the pressure is high in thÂ« interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along thÂ« coast, rain Is probable:
but. when the "low is inclosed with Isobars of

able. With a "high" in :he vicinity of Idaho, and
â  the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
. weather in winter. The reverse oi these conditions

NEW YORK, N. V.. Feb. 13. â Irregularity
was the chief feature characteristic of the stock
market at the opening to-day. At the Initial trad

d. ciined sharply in a number of instances, busar
fell % 10 1103/ i, tobacco IVi to 68V4- and
leather preferred 1 14 to 65 y 2 . The coal and Iron
stocks were deprt-siiu, the unfortunate condition
of the trade and the serious break in the price of
s.eel rails having led to liquidations. Illinois
Steel broke 214 to 30, while oft' lots of Minnesota
Iron brought 47 against 50 for the last reported
sale. Tennessee Coal and Iron fell 2% to 2(ji/8 ' n
â¢ sympathy.
The railway list was easy for a time on cable ad

Crete. Louisville and Nashville, Atchison and
Northern Pacific were all sold by foreign bouses.

* Interest. In the bituminous coalers. Hocking Val

UNION STOCKYARDS, Ilu. Feb. 13.-One
of the most striking features of the cattle market
at the present timeistae extraordinary demani
for good feeding stock, which is soiling at rela
tively higher prices. Feeder* were making fair
profit on the cattle they are sending to market,
though they are only half fat, and they are en
couraged to buy more cattle, as feed is abundant
and cattle promise to continue In active demand.
Droves averaging from 1350 to 1650 pounds are
much sought after. Only a handful of cattle
were received to-day and the market was quiet.
Arrivals of ltf.ooo bogs to-day brought toe sup
ply of the entire ween up to 16*,7 50, against 16a,
--978 las: wee* and 129.234 for the corresponding
week a year ago. -Prices for ho^s at pre cnt are
higher than the relative prices of paric. lari and
ribs, but there It an active demand for green and
cured meat, and it this continues ho* values will
increase In strength. There was an active de
mand to-day and prices were 5c higher.
The week's- supply of sheep toots up 61.400
head, against Z>&. 4f07 last week and 64.906 a year
a<o. Tne few sheep receiver to-day were readily
disposed of at linn prices.

Wonders Seen
Through a Giant
Eye of Science
BF* HE close of the present century bills T
â¢Â£l''-- fair to substantiate the claims which
cT*fC/ have been piu forward by many
enthusiasts that it would mark a great era
of discoveries in the field of science. So
rapid are announcements now made of new
processes and applications of natural re- !
courses, of better understanding of nat- ;
ural laws and discoveries of nature's se- !
crets, that astonishment is almost sup- \
planted by bewilderment. All of the dis- i
coveries and inventions which have bene- j
fited mankind are latter-day productions,
and more than one-half of the total have
been made known to the world during the
past twenty-live year-. The marvelous |
operations of the telephone are no longer
mysterious, and yet its discovery only j
attains its legal majority of twenty- i
one years this present year. The \
transmission of visual images by electric j
energy is an established fact, now being
put into simpler practical shape for gen
eral use, and the application of the electric !
force to purposes of illumination is of !
about the same age. A curious feature
connected with the discoveries of the
past quarter of a century is the fact that >
in nearly all of them electricity plays :
some important par ; it is generally one of â¢.
the dominant factors in the discovery,
without which tne new affair could not
exist.
Next to electricity light forms one of the j
prominent constituents of the new dis
coveries. Whether in its application to ;
illumination or photography greater
strides toward the perfect knowledge has
been made with light and its manifesta
tions than with any other save electricity.
And yet, with the possession of all that |
THE GIANT REFLECTORâ A NEW EYE OF SCIENCE.
has been learned, we do not know the
actual difference between the two; no un
biased scientist would hazard any otber
statement save that they are different
manifestations of the same thing.
One of the applications of light, that of
pbotocraphy, has added to astronomical
science the most powerful ally it possesses.
It is the unseen but all-seeing eye of that
wonderful science. The photographic
camera sees r.nd imperishably fixes for the
deliberate gaze of man's inferior vision
that to which the human eye, even though
it oe aided by the moat powerful lenses, is
totally blind. Stars so minute that the
giant telescope crowning Mount Hamilton
fails to reveai their presence to the human
gazing intently at the end of the colossal
tube are seen with ease by the pho
tographic eye and their spectral images
indelibly fixed upon the sensitive plate.
As between the first ruda and weak
magnifying glass and the present teiescop3
there is a creat distance which has been
bridged over by very many improve
ments, each adding sorue valuable feature
to the make-up of the magnificent instru
ment with which the searchers of the tky
now seel: to unravel some of the countless
mysteiies of the sidereal heavens. But
with all the improvements, the modern
telescope is far from being a satisfactory
instrument. Two things are necessary in
a telescopeâ an ability to magnify ana an
ability to grasp light. The instrument
may have great magnifying powers and
yet be so deficient in light power as to
render the object it is pointed at invisible
for want of sufficient illumination. It is
the happy combining of these two quali
ties by a proper shaping of the lenses
which make famous a good glass. ThÂ«re
is a limit, beyond which is only failure.
The light-gathering power of a telescope
may be pushed to great development, but
it is at the expense of the defining power;
while a lense ground to produce the great
est definition Joses light power. Thus,
unfortunately, telescopic aid is limited!
Man is unable to see all that he desires of
tne distant spheres which grace the mid
night sky. Recently photography has
come to his aid and has proved to be a
veritable "eye of science."
A photographic plaie exposed to the
sky reveals the presence of countless stars
winch are wholly invisible with the best
telescope. Man has ever been and ever
will be desirous of knowing all that can be
possibly known about the heavenly bodies.
The spectroscope in conjunction witu the
tele.-cope makes certain declarations con
cerning the physical constitution of ttie
stars, but frequently there has arisen
{trave doubts as to the accuracy of spec
troscopic evidence as applied to as
tronomy. The spectroscope declares that
there is neither water nor moisture nor
atmosphere upon the moon or Mars, whilo
competent and cautious observers who
have for long periods carefully studied
these bodies emphatically declare that
Mary, especially, has abundant water,
nioifcture and an atmosphere. The great
problem as to the habitabiluy of the stars,
the profound query. Are they inhabited?
mu-t find its answer through other me
diumship than that of the spectroscope.
Evidently, if it were possible to distinguish
an object on the surface of Mars say
twenty feet square, the solution of the
absorbing problem would be approxi
mately arrived at. Now the obstacle in
the way of seeing an object twenty feet
square upon the surface of the ruddy
planet is the hitherto impossibility of
constructing a telescope which would
magnify enough and at the same time
give sufficiently clear definition coupled
with abundant light.
It is believed that this great desidera
turn has been attained. Plans are now
completed for a telescope with photo
graphic attachment, which it is claimed
will accomplish the desired result. To
understand tue newly devised telescope
some little knowledge must be had of
lignt. In our common acquaintanceship
of light we are apt to conceive that light
is simply illumination and then dismiss
the subject from all further consideration.
In fact light is a very complex phenome
non. It is, so to speak, a bundle of rays,
some of which are bright and luminous,
and of course visible; others are non
luminous and therefore invisible, but are
just as much a portion of the whole visible
light as are any, and in fact without them
there would be no light. T:>ese invisible
rays, while inoperative on the retina of
tne human eye, are extremely powerful
in their action upon the photographic
plate. To illustrate: The interior of a
perfectly dark room may be photographed
in every detail without the presence of a
particle of visible light, provided that the
exposure of the photographic plate be con
tinued long enough. The construction of
the new telescope is based upon the de
ductions arrived at from this knowledge.
Telescopes are of two kinds, the "reflect
ing." which employ a largo concave re
flector from which is reflected the ob
served object to a small lense in the eye
piece, and "refracting" telescopes, which
use a large glass leuse called the "object
glass." The first kind give more light
than the latter. Tne latter give better
definition.
The new telescope will consist of a huge
refractor of metal, carefully ground to a
proper curve, and highly polished, and
from its great size will be constructed and
mounted in sections. When the pans are
assembled in place to form the complete
mirror it will measure 200 feet in diame
ter. To mount so gigantic an affair
would require frame work of enormous
dimensions, and besides, any improve- i
nient of the whole would be extremely j
difficult; certainly no delicacy of move- j
ment could be attained. The huge con
cave mirror is therefore held in place by a
framework of steel and brasÂ«, so arranged
as to compensate for expansion and con- J
traction, and thus preserve ths symmetry
of the mirror under changes of tempera
ture. Tnis framework rests upon a tank,
or float which is supported in a pond or j
bacin of water. By this means stability
of equipoise is secured, the vibration of
the earth is reduced to a minimum, and
by a well-planned system of movable
weights, the mirror may be made to in
cline at a desired angle, or turn from one
point of the heavens to another.
The image reflected from this giant
speculum mirror is received at the prcper j
focus by the lenses of the eyepiece, which !
is situated 3000 feet distant from the sur- !
face of the mirror. This lengthy focal
distance is necessary for the purpose of
keeping the reflected rays as nearly par
allel as possible, so that distortion at the
focal point my be diminished to a mini
mum and a liner definition obtained than
would be possible should the rays converge
at the acute anelas.
Notwithstanding that our moon is called
a "dead" star and is supposed to have no
heat of its own, yet it reflects to us the
heat as well as the light of the sun, and
every stellar body sends some heat to the
earth. The concentrated rays of the huge
mirror used in the new telescope would
convey sufficient heat from the moon's
surface to destroy the eyesight of any ob
server who had the temerity to look into
the unprotected eyepiece. To remedy this
a translucent prism of rock salt is placed
in front of the eyepiece between it and the
big mirror, which absorbs the heat rays.
It. however, very materiilly dims the im
age of the object unler observation, and
when the telescope is used for photo
graphic purposes the salt prism is re
moved.
To satisfactorily observe a celestial ob
ject, as a star, the telescope must be made
to "follow the star," that is, it must be
made to move in a contrary direction to
that of the earth. In ordinary astronom
ical telescopes this is accomplished by a
clock, whose works connect with the tele
scope and keep it constantly pointed at
the object observed. But the giant re
flector is too large for this, and its gaze 13
therefore confined to.objects in the zenith
or close to it. Fortuuately, the rotation
of the earth upon her axis brings most of
the desirable heavenly objects to the
zenith at one time or the other. The huge
telescope here described is movable only
to a very slight degree, and used as an ob
servation instrument for the human eye
would prove unsatisfactory. But the pho
tographic eye is the one intended for its
saze. Photographic science has narrowed
down the length gf time of exposure nec
essary to produce a perfect negative to the
one-ten-thousandth part .of a second;
while the perfection attained in the pro
duction of p oiograph:c films makes it a
comparatively simple task to obtain a-pic
ture so inhnitesimally small as to require
the highest power microscope to make
visible to the human eye the photo
graDhed view, which is, however, com
plete and clear in every detail.
Used as intended, the giant reflector
will have no eyepiece, but in its place
will be a specially constructed photo
graphic camera, fitted with a system of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1897
clockwork which rotates a long ribbon of
extremely sensitive tilm, and while in ope
ration opens and closes a shutter in f ron t|of
the him with a rapid motion. The sur
face of the film is adjusted at the exact
focal point of the hune mirror with such
dolicacy as to produce upon the film an
imaee no larger than the head of a pin.
The pictures thus taken may be, after
they are "fixed," enlarged Dy any of the
usual means to any desired size, so that it
is possible and practicable to depict upon
a screen from one of theie film-pictures
an exact image of an object on the surface
of Mars twenty feet square.
By a novel arrangement the rays re
flected from the great mirror are deprived
of their heat before they enter the camera
i by passing througli a metal cylinder of
! peculiar construction, whereby all heat is
! at once transformed into electrical energy,
i thus leaving the pure actinic rays alone to
I inannge upon the photographic film.
The revelations to be made by the use
I of this giant instrument are beyond con
ception. Questions that have for all lime
puzzled the brains of the most profound
thinkers and exhausted the inventive
genius of former inventors to devise the
mechanical means of solution may now
be solved. We may confidently hone to
definitely know whether or not our earth
is the only habited globe. The physical
j constitution of our sun and of the planets
I and stars will be better understood when
i we shall use this last devised instrument
of cyclopean vision. It is proposed to
erect the instrument upon some elevated
tableland bordering the Pacific Coast, for
the reason that a clearer atmosphere may
there be found â probably within easy
' reach of the Golden Gate.

Wit lnl r:Â«\v< Hi* Cage to Recover Butler's
Kffecta and Peace I -. Kestored.
The threatened legal erabroglio in the
federal courts over the effects of Murderer
Butler is off. Just at the time when it
seemed as if the joint power of the United
States, as represented by Henry S. Foote,
and her Majesty's Government, in the
person of Consul J. M. Warburton, would
be necessary to keep Marshal Baldwin in
posseÃsion of the property the unexpected
happened. Attorney Pidwell withdrew
his replevin suit in the Justice's court, and
the row and its cause had both disap
penred.
Pid;vell appeared in the ofhee of the
United States District Attorney and de
murely presented Assistant Attorney Bert
iScnlessinger with a notice that he had de
cided not to press the action to recover
Butler's property further. Accompany
ing tbis was an official notice of with
drawal of the replevin suit. The word
was hurriedly passed to Marshal Bald
win's oilice and thence to the British
Consul. There were congratulations ull
around that a serious international
wrangle had been avoided. There was
tijose who said the clearing away of the
difficulty visibly affected the entire Fed
eral colony.
JOHN DALY IN DANGER.
He Will Have to Go to Jail ii
He Fails to Pay a Doc
tor's Bill.
Julee Coff y Is Tired of Having His
O.d rs in a Guardianship M it
ter Disobeyed.
Judge Coffey has issued a writ for the
I arrest of John Daly, guardian of his son
i James, because said guardian fails to pay
a bill of $170 due from the estate of the
minor to Dr. Frederick Bass for profes
sional services.
Young Daly was injured by a railroad
car and was given a verdict for $1500 dam
ages against the company. His father
collected the money, acting as his son's
guardian under the order of the Probate
Court. Dr. iiass attended the boy during
his illness, and thought his services in
saving the lad's life would ba worth at
least $170.
When Daly appeared in court to ex
plain his failure to pay the doctor's claim
he admitted that all the money was gone,
though the account showed that there
ought to be several hundred dollars on
hand. Thereupon he was directed to pay
the bill.
Attorney Cobb, representing Dr. Bass,
complained that Daly had ignored the
order of the court, so the Sheriff is di
rected to "attach the person of said John
Daly and commit him to prison unt.l he
shall have complied with the said order,
or be otherwise discharged according to
the order of the court."
Several years ago a similar case was taken
to the Supreme Court on a writ of habeas
corpus, the plea being that an attempt
was being made to put a man In jail for
debt. On behalf of the Probite Court it
was responded that this was not an action
in debt; that a guardian of an estate is an
officer of the court in every sense of the
word, and aÂ« such iÂ» subject to the court's
control in the disbursement of moneys re
ceived as Kunrdiac; that the court hud a
right to direct the payment of the moneys
according to the rights of the parties in
terested, end that in enforcing this order it
was the right o: the trial Judge to commit
delinquents for contempt of court.

MfiEW YORK. N. V.. Feb. 8.-"Roses
X red and violets blue, sugar is
\ sweet, and so are you!" Didn't we
just revel in those old-fashioned lines
years and years ago, when we were
tots and the wonderful St. Valentine's
Day was a day of expectancy ! Don't you
recall how you used to cratch for the post
man, or hurry down to the little postoffico
and wait for "your turn," when the dear
old St. Valentine's Day came alons?
Don't you remember how shaky your
youthful fingers seemed as you broke the
seal, or tore the envelope open â thÂ» big
white envelope â all Dressed around the
edges with tiny forget-me-nots, roses ana
pansies; and oh, how your heart thumped
and drubbed against your ribs, and how
you glowed inwardly and outwardly when
you read those old, old lines: "Roses red
and violets blue, sugar is sweet and so are
you"; or perhaps it only said: "Be my
Valentine." And you would tiss the stiff
cardboard rapturously, and in your excite
ment fancy it was kissing; you in return,
ana then you would lovingly gaze at the
little artificial pink roses and green leaves
which nestled down in a lot of paper-lace,
and the two clasped hands, double hearts
and cooin : doves adorning the open-work
cird seemed to you to be symbolical of joy
and everlasting happiness.
On, weren't those perfect days? !
Wouldn't you ju?t love to have that same j
old sweet trustful and peaceful sensation
creep up through your being: now and
steal your weary senses for a day ? It's a |
pity that Valentine's day is losing its j
popularity and romance. It is because
we have a greater tendency to the practi
cal side of life, thereby excluding all
sentiment, and in our desire to progress
we are simply parting with all the poetry j
and idealism our souls arc capable of. It
isn't quite fair, is it?
When the Majestic steamed into port
last Tnursday it brought back to our
shores a number of Californians, who
nave been abroad for many months.
Amonc them were W. B. Bourn ana
Miss Maude C. Bourn who have
been "doing the Continent" and Brit
isli Isles. They will remain in New

ence of an Eistern winter.
Mrs. James Cunningham and children,
â¢who have been stopping at the Bucking

J. W. Raphael will have a score of ex
BROS.
planation3 to make to a bunch of friends
here if he does not come back to town
within the week and make it all clear to
them. On Saturday afternoon, late, he
floated into the Manhattan Hotel, depos
ited his baggage on the marble desk and
registered his arrival in a big, bold hand.
None of his downtown friends knew of his
arrival that night, and on Monday when
they went up to his notei to rind him, be
hold, he had fled ! Tne word he left was
that "he was going upcountry on busi
ness and would return in a few days." Up
to last accounts the bunch of friends were
patiently waiting for his return to town
so they might give him a royal good wel
come and a happy time.
Mrs. Lucy MacDougall and R. L. Mac-

Hotel Netherland her home also when
ever she is in New York. About ten dnys
asro she returned to her residence in
Washington. D. C, where she entertains
so delightfully. Mrs. Hearst is a lady of
such rare ability and generous soul that
it is not strange she has a host of ad
mirers and is beloved by scores of true
and loyal friends.
W. P. Gaidiner of Los Aneeles reachea

Josiali W. Stanford of San Francisco is

E. M. Bray of San Francisco is a new

Hon. W. F. Goad, accompanied by his
two lovely daughters, Miss Genevieve* and
Miss Aileen, registered at the Hotel Wal
dorf on Friday morning. Their journey
through from thÂ« sunny slopes of Cali
fornia to the ice-bound rivers and valleys
of these Eastern States was pleasant and
uneventful.
Mr. Goad declares that he and bis
daughters are on a pleasure trip, in every
sense of the word, and that they came to
New York during the winter months just
to get a taste of zero weather and experi
ence winter sports. Mr. Goad's son, W.
F. Qoad Jr., is in bis senior year at St.
Pau;'s School, Concord, N. H., and after
a visit to dim and a few weeks in New
York enjoying the opera and theaters,
Mr. Goad and the Misses Goad will travel

the grand Mardi Gras festival. It is quite
settled that W. F. Goad Jr. will enter Har
vard next year. His ambitions and in
clinations are to follow in the footsteps of
his successful and worthy father.

William G. Henshaw of Oakland hurried
through town on Monday.
B. Hart and John A. Britton are guests
at the Imperial.
Not many people know that Joseph R.
Grismer, the successful manager and
actor, is a poet. He has written a num
ber of very pretty things, and here is a
verse that serves as a tribute to California ;
it was written by him in a young lady's '
album, but I hardly think be will care if
I appropriate them here:
Here's Co the sun-kissed plain
Where the missions sleep,
And the tangled Mils
Where the wild vines creep
The snow-capped peaks
Where the storm-clouds lovvce
An I the recessed dales
Where the redwoods tower.
The word-picture is complete, ana the
verse would adorn a valentine.
They say that spring is near, perhaps it
is, but violets are a dollar a bunch just
the same and the bunches are small, too,
about the size you buy on Market and
Kearny streets for 10 cents a bunch. 1
was looking over a letter the other day,
written by a youn-: Bostonese who was vis
itine Ualitornia. She was expatiating on
the climate, ttc, and ended up this wise:
"And, oh, Edith dear, you ought to see
my room this moment; it i<* a perfect
bower of lovely flowers. Entre nous,
dear, if flowers were as cheap at home we
would feel insulted unless a man sent us a
whole cartload." Mercenary Bostonese!
