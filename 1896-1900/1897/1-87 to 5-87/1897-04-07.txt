LONDON, Eire., April 6â Although
there have been no important changes in
the attitude of Greece or Turkey or the
KING CHRISTIAN of Denmark, Who, It Is Reported at Paris,
Has Been Asked at the Instance of the Czar of Russia to
Arbitrate the Cretan Question.
powers generally, the impression prevails
throuehout Europe that the situation has
distinctly improved during the past
twenty-four hours.
The Greek independence day celebration,
which it was feared would result in hos
tilities on the frontier, has passed almost
uneventfully. The populace at Athens
and other points in Greec?, accordlne to
dispatches received here, indulged in war
like demonstrations, but ;hat has become
a daily commonplace.
It is now generally believed, even in St.
Petersburg, tbat Greece is by no means
determined upon war. This accounts in
; art for the less severe attitude that the
i.owers have at the last moment assumed
toward King George. There is ro longer
any donbt that France is supporting Lord
Salisbury, the British Prime Minister, in
favor of a fhilder policy, and Russia, there
fore, is unable to insist upon severe
measures upon Greece. It is too ear.'y yet
to say whether the powers will now com
pel the immediate withdrawal of the
Turkish troops from Crete in order to con
ciliate Greek public cpinion, but some
such move ~eems more possible now than
at niiy other stage of the crisis.
The situation on the frontier of course
continues critical, but it is ie't that the
greater danger has been avoided by
to-day's escape from an outbreak.
In tne House of Commons to-day Right
Hon. A. J. lialfour, First Lord ol the
Treasury and the Government leader in
the House, said that the majority refused
to devote a day to debate a motion for an
address to the Queen praying that the
forces of the crown *hai! not be employed
a ainst the kingdom of Greece or tbe peo
ple of Crete, in accordance with the notice
given by Sir William Hare.ourt, the leader
of the opposition, yesterday. The ground
on which he based his refusal was the lact
that the proposed motion was altogether
ambiguous.
Mr. Balfour added that if the opposition
would put a direct motion of a want of
confidence in the Government he would
fix a day for ii? discu-s on.
lit Wiiiiam Harcourt made no reply to
Mr. Balfoar's remarks.
ATHENS, Greece. April 6.â 'io-day was
tiie aeveiiiv-sixtli anniversary of the open
ing of tbe war f.Â«r Grecian independence,
â  iiid it was feared that, with tne war feel
.ng that at present pervades all classes of
society, the day might result in demnn
otrations that wouid prove extremely em
barrassing te the Government. Dis pate lies
received from all parts of the kingdom
show that tlte day was celebrated with iar
more entuusiasru than usual, but the peo
j.le were entirely orderly.
The San Francisco Call
One important fact that tended to a
quiet celebration was that a very large
proportion of the male population is ooder
anus on the frontier of Thessaly. Mucb
i relief is felt in Government circles that
i the day pa-seci without any attempt being
made to force the hand of the King and
j hia advisers. There is, however, an muler
j current of fi-eling against the Government
j for its alleged diiatoriness in dealing effec-
I lively with the situation, and. though it
, was not materially felt to-day, there is
! no teiling whon it may breaK forth and
] carry all before it.
In Athens itself the celebration was car
: ri^d on with the greatest enthusiasm.
All business was suspended. The pro
gramme of the day's festivities included a
Te Deum at the cathedral in the morning.
j This religious service was attended by
; King George and Queen Ol^a, the Minis
ters of State and foreign diplomat*. The
; service was marl:rd with more than usual
I solemnity, all present feeling that divine
! aid was indeed needed to carry Greece
I through the troublous days now confront
i iiig her.
The route from the palace to the cathe
dral was lined by the enthusiastic popu
lace, who were eager to salute the King
| and Quren and to jrive expression to their
| sympathy with their maje-ties. As the
i Kine and Queen drove along in an open
carriage they were constantly cheered by
, the crowds.
Some of the more ardent advocates of
war had caused to be printed a large num
ber of papers bearing the inscription,
"Hurrah for war!'' and these were scat
tered broadcast throughout the city with
the evident intention of further inflaming
the popular passion, and many of them
were thrown by spectators into the King's
carriage.
After the cathedral service the day was
civen over to general hoiiday-makini:.
The peopie all gave free expression to
tneir feelinz of patriotism, but the day
was marked by an utter alsence of ils
order.
A feature of the decorations in honor of
the dny was the entire absence of all for
eign flags except those which wero flying
from the various legations. The Greek
colors, however.were most plentifully used,
scarcely a home in the city not displaying
the national colors.
When the royal procession was en
route to the cathedral the ci:eers of the
wildly enthusiastic crowds friehtened the
hordes attached Â«.o the carriage of the
Crown Princess Sophia, who had returned
from Laris-sa, whither she proceeded with
the Crown P ince when he went to as
sume command of the Greet troops in
Thessaly. The horses bolted ana the car
riage was overturned. The incioent crea
ted the most intense excitement and it
was feared that Princess Sophia would be
killed. A hundred persons rubbed forward
and righted the carriage, when much to
the relief of everybody it was found that
the Crown Princess had escaped unhurt.
She entered tL>e carriage of King George
and continued on her way to the cathe
dral. PrinceÂ«s Sophia is a sister of Empe
ror Wiliiam, and it has been asserted and
denied that her changing from the evan
gelical faith of her family to the Greek
faith of her husband had niucn to do with
the hostile attitude of Etnporor \Viliam
toward Greece.
A great meeting was held here this
afternoon, at which a resolution was
adopted protesting against the action of
the powers in their efforts to cru-h the
rightful aspirations of the Hellenes and
indorsing tho Government on the linn
stand it had taken and maintained in the
defense of Greek riglits. The meeting ap
pointed a deoutation to convey the ref
lation to the King.
Beverai thousand persons accompanied
the deputation to the palace, shouting
'â¢Zsto Ho Po;ecnos." The crowd invaded
the vestibule of the palace, and the troops
on duty there had great difficulty in pre
venting them from entering further.
Large crowds continued in the square
I In front of the palace throughout the day.
They r.-peatodly called for the King, but
hiÂ« Majesty did not appÂ«ar.
Passing nlam was caused this afternoon
by the discharge of pistols among the
crow.!-. It was at hrst thought that an
outbreak was abmt to occur. The troop*
were immediately re-enforced and further
and more stringent precautions were
taken to prevent disorders. i t was sub .
sequen;ly learned that the alarm was,
catisea by enthmiaitic spirits who were
discharging a feu de joie. Nothing more
serious occurred during tbe day than a
few scuffles, which were easily stopped by
the police.

Theodore Roosevelt, who has jus: been nominated Assistant Secretary of the Navy, is now President of the Board of Police

In ISS6 he was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Mayor of New York and soon afterward was appointed a member

It has been said of him that he knows bumen nature, which, after all, is a very simple process, and teat he knows civil service,

SIR JOHN WILLOUGHBY'S LETTERS
In Them He Said He Believed the Jame-
son Raid IVos Sanctioned by the
Imperial Authorities.
LONDON, Eng.. April 6.â At to-day's
sitting of the Parliamentary South Afri
can Committee an t fficial from the War
Office produced a number of letters writ
ten by Major Sir John Willoughby, the
contents of which the witness refused to
di-cloae on the demand of Mr. Labou
ch<>re at the sitting of lasi Friday.
Tiie rirst letter read wasda'ed from Hol
loway jail, where Willoughby was serving
a term of icti months' imprisonment,
which recently expired. In the commu
nication the writer "-aid he had taken part
in the Jameson movement in pursuance
of orders from the administrator of Mata
beleland in the honest belief that the
raid was undertaken with the Knowledge
and assent of the imperial authorities.
Major Wilioughby was called to the
stand and Sir William Harconrt asked
him a number of quest ons designed to
draw out a statement lor his reasons for
believing that the raid had the sanction
of imperial authority, to which he an
swered that his belief was ba?ed upon
private conversations which he had had
with Dr. Jameson. The witness was
pressed for a more detailed answer, but
after fencing witn his questioner for a
while he finally refused to give any fur
ther answer.
The chairman warned Major Wil
loughby that the testimony he was giving
was in direct conflict with tnat given by
Dr. Jameson and asked him to explain to
the committee the reason why the testi
mony of the two should be so much at
variance. VVil!ouÂ°:hby repeatedly de

CARTER HENRY HARRISON, Democratic Mayor of Chicago.
Carter Henry Harrison, who has just been elected M.iyor of Chicago, is, taking him
broadly, very like his lato father. The eldest son of Chicago's once favorite citizen, Mr. Har
rison resembles the late Mayor in his beif-assertiveness, courage and strong individuality.
He has great stability, strength of character and utter independence. He is a Harrison clear
through. He is approaching middle age.
Mr. Harrison's experieuce as a politician has not been narrow. Ho has never been a candidate
for office, although he has nelpcd candidates to office, he has been busy in the life of politics as
a party organizer, ft club man and a delegate to conventions. His lrieads, who rallied round
his name and personalltv with great enthusiasm, once before: proposed him ior Mayor, hue
he declined. He wns again proposed as candidate for State Treasurer, but declined that
honor also. Ever since his Kraduation from college he has been to some aeeree engaged in
the real estate business. He !eft that walk when his fattier purchased the Times, and was the
editor of that paper a while. Then he took charge of the business department, of which he
was chief when the pnper went out of existence as a distinct journai. After that Mr. Harrison
took a trip abroad, nnd since his return has been engaged in real estate matters. In nis last
taken portrait, which is herewith presented, Mr. Harrison wears a beard. The beard has

countenance.

by asking which imperial authority the
witness believed to have sanctioned the
raid, but he refused to answer.
The chairman informed Willouchby
tbat both he and Dr. Jameson would be
recalled for the purpose of reconciling
their statements, and the committee then
adjourned until Friday.

CHICAGO, 111., April 6.â With the
magic of his famous father's name, aided
by the independent split in the regular
Republican ranks and the Hocking of the
discontented laboring class to the stand
ard of silver Democracy, Carter Henry
Harrison was elected Mayor of Chicago to
day, and a great Democratic triumph was
recorded. The 50.000 plurality of McKin
iey over Brvan was turned into a Demo
cratic plurality of about 85,000 over Judge
Nathaniel U. Sears, the machine Repub

complete mayoralty returns show that

140,000, !oÂ«s than 5000 under the vote

Kiniey polled votes in November.
The rest of the city ticketâ Attorney,
Treasurer and Cierkâ all the town tickets
and a large majority ol the Common
Council have pone Democratic on the
tidal wave, with the possible exception
of the Hyde Park town ticket. Harrison
cr Harlan carried every ward in the city,
and the Republican machine was repudi
ated everywhere.
There is redly nothing left for the Re
publican party to console itself with ex
cept a few Aldermen whose records were
good and who happened to live in wards

ment of the Republicans that if llessing

withdrawn, Judge Sears would have won,
does not hold good when it is shown that
Harrison has a clear majority over all
three. The other city tickets in the field
cut no figure at all.
There was a joyful demonstration of
Democrats on the street when the victory
became assured, and thousands gathered
in front of the newspaper offices to cheer
as the news was displayed. There were
impromptu parades, fireworks and much
cannonading of lhe atmosphere.
Carter Harrison said of the result:
"Itbasbeeii a victory of a united and
not a divided Democracy. Gold as well as
silver men cast their ballots for me, and
registered a protest against Republican
misruie. The wcrkingmen were with
me."
Tne late returns indicate that the Demo
crats will have thirty-nine Aldermen out
of eighty-six in the Council. Twenty
eight of the Democratic candidates are
probably elecied out of thirty-four, and,
with the eleven Democratic hold-over
Aldermen, will give that party a majority
in the legislative body.

ST. LOUIS, Mo., April 6â After a cam
paign of three weeks, during whicn every
trick known to municipal politics was
worked, ihe city election took place here
to-day with little excitement. The entire
Republican ticket, headed by Zieginheim,
for Mayor, was elected by majorities
ranging frcm 3000 to 18,000, in a total vote
of about 80,000.
The municipal assembly will be about
eveniy divided. Opposed to Ziegenheini
for Mayor was Harrison (r^juiar Demo
crat) and Meriweather (bolting Demo
crat). The campaign was purely local
and settles nothing as to the strength of
the two parties in St. Lo'ris.
ST. PAUL. iJiNN., April 6â Municipal

At Mankato, however, A. R. Pfau (D.)

They Continue to Refuse
to Listen to Weyler's
Offers.
Cubans Will Not tease Fight

Granted.
Rivera Will Not Be Shot Unless Per

Authorities.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 6.â The
Sun's Havana cable says: Desertions are
still very numerous in the Spanish army.
At Matanzas a company of forty-seven
men passed over to the insurgents on
account of the scanty and poor food sup
ply and the non-payment of the money
due them. The authorities are careful to
prevent this news from beine printed here
for fear it may influence the rest of the
army to follow the same course. In Santa
Clara province the desertions are still
more numerous.
By orders from Madrid, Weyier is trying
again to induce the insurgents to accept
the alleged reforms, and has employed for
that purpose Senor Mario Garcia, ex-
Mayor of the town of Sancti Spiritus.
Senor Garcia, notwithstanding the ill
success of liis former proposals, indirectly
made to Gomez by the correspondent of
El Liberal, Senor Morot, has again ac
cep:ed the mission and has written the
Cubans in a pleading way and asked their
acceptance of the reforms.
General Weyier suggests to the insur
gents that after the present plau of re
forms had been practically tried in the
island Spain will grant to Cuba more lib
eral home rule. He holds out the pros
pect of a general amnesty, including the
pardon of all Cubans who are in the revo
tionary ranks and all who are under
charges before the Spanish tribunals for
common offenses. He adds that In the
treaty of capitulation the insurgents will
receive all the military honors of a bellig
erent army.
It is positively known that notwith
standing ail the semi-official Spanish news
to the contrary, General Gomez has sternly
rejected all those propouais ana warned
Senor Garcia that if he ever fniis into his
hands he will be banged as a traitor.
The same attitude is assumed by the
Cuban Government at Camaguey. A com
mittee from General Ji.nainez Castellanos
was dismissed by President Cisneros wilh
the answer that though the Cubans do not
like to ill-treat official deputations, they
will be obliged to arrest and try before a
drum-head court-martial ail who may in
future enter the Cuban camp with pro
posals for peace not based on the abso
lute independence of the island.
Tbere is great excitement nmong the
uncompromising Spaniards of Havana be
cause the proceedings of the court-martial
against General Ruiz Rivera hare been
delayed by orders from Madrid. Yester
day in Murallo street, which is the
borough that is crowded with Spanish
volunteers, the Government was openly
accused of cowardice. The Spanish au
thorities answer that the delay in the exe
cution of Rivera is not fear of retaliation
by the Cubans, but is a diplomatic meas
ure intended to produce a good impres
sion among the foreign powers. The
press censors have suppressed nil news
about resolutions protesting against the
shooting of Rivera presented in the United
States Senate and In all manifestations of
symyoathy for Rivera in that country.
General Weyier very reluctantly gave
the order to the court-martial to delay the
sentence, out he has not ordered the pro
ceedings to stop. Rivera, therefore, may
be shot whenever Weyier can secure per
mission Irom Madrid.
GEMERAL KIVKHA'S COM>ITIOS,
Wound* Aggravated Owing to the Ig
norance of Spanlth Doctor*.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 7.-A Snn
special from Havana says: It is difficult
to get from Spanish sources any news
from San Cristobal concerning General
Ruiz Rivera. The press censor permit!'
only a few unimportant details to be
known. It is stated here that General
Rivera is worse from his wounds and that
he is suffering from fever, probably the
result of unskillful treatment by his physi
cian.
Ttie room in which he is confined has
no sanitary conveniences. Nothing that
might be called antiseptic treatment is
applied to him or to his cbief of staff,
Colonel Bacallao. His case is so serious
that the Cubans believe that poison is ap
plied to his wound?, but it is more likely
that he is a victim of the prevailing ignor
ance among the Spanish military doctors.
The Spaniards say that he is well treated,
and they doubtless believe this to bÂ« true,
but the scanty medical resources at San
Cristobal are certainly imperiling his life.
It is learned from reliable tsources that
when Ruiz Rivera was captured he was
marching eastward to confer with General
Gomez in compliance with orders from his
chief. General Gomez approved of
Rivera's refusal to listen to the terms of
peace brought to him by tne Spanish Com
missioner?. Qomez says in a ietter ad
dressed to a friend in Sancii Spiritus:
'I have little doubt that the real pur
pose of General Weyler in making all
these overtures for peace is to prepare a
trap for me, and assassinate me if I had
the weakness to yield to a conference un
der a Hag ot trÂ«ice. Every day I feel more
indicnant over the doings of Weyler, and
I am resolved, if the Spaniards do not
soon change their criminal methods of
warfare, to issue orders for strong retali
ation by the Cuban army.
"We are meeting their crimes with the
honorable conduct that should character
ize all civilized belligerents, but there is a
limit to my endurancs and I am tired of
seeing Cubans barbarously ;nurderod by
the Spanish columns. My belief that
Weyler intends to assassinate me is based
upon reliable information."
Recent news from General Gomez is to
the effect that the wound he is said to
have received three weeks ago near Ar
royo Blanco wai merely a scratch and
that he is now in perfectly good health.

ROBBER Y OF A POST OFFICE.
Postmaster Carrick end His Daughter
Bound and Gagged by Men, Who
Make a Big Haul.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, April 6.â A special
to the Ecripps-McÃae League from Tiffin,
Ohio, says: Postmaster Carrick and his
daughter, at Kockaway, the eastern part
of this county, were bound and jjagged
last night and the postottice burglarized.
Carriclc was brutally assaulted.
2> early $"JUOO in money and securities
were etoien. Bloodhounds have been
taken to the scene.
It was well known in the neighborhood
that the Postmaster was a plucky man and
would give up his life rather than surren-
dor anything in the office. For this rea
son it is believed that the robbers were
well acquainted with the office workings
and watched a chance to surprise Carrick.
Before they overcame him, however, he
made a desperate resistance and tor that
reason they beat him after they had bouud
him.
The daughter heard the scuffling, but
before Â»he c^uid make any outcry she was
also bound and gagged. The authorises
have a general idea who the men are and
with the aid of bloodhounds they hope to
capture them in a few uays.

Whils the Situ:ticn Is Thought to
Be Improv:d, the Worst Is
Yet to Come.
NEW ORLEANS. La., April 6.â A
special to the Daily btates, dated Helena,
Ark., April 6, cays: The river declined
eight inches last night, making two feet
from the highest mark reached this year,
but still a foot and & half abovo the high
est flood mark of previous years. The
danger is not over, but the situation is
improving. The number of refugees is
increasing every hour, as beleaguered fam
ilies from points remote from the river
are arriving.
Sever..: expeditions were sent out of
here to-day to rescue negroes on back
plantations, who are cooped up in gin
houses and barns. Tne oveiflow on Old
Town Ridiie. which Is provided with a
private levee, is deeper by two feet than
ever Enown before.
Engineers caiculate the crevasses in the
Arkansas levee and from Helena to La
con ia, thirteen in number, are carrying off
a third as much water as is conveyed in
the channel ol the river. Helena is pro
tected by cross-levees. Drainage and
seepage water is baing pumped oat by
powerful hydraulic pumps running day
and nigtit. There is <lv ,t on the streets
here, white a wall of water to an average
height of fifteen feet surrounds Helena.
The city is taking care to-day of 1500
homeless negroes camped In tents on the
hillsides. Ralroad trains all stop out of
the city three miles, mviiÂ«, passengers and
express being transferred by boat, one
road, the Arkansas Midland, being the
only one able to reacn the city.
ST. LOUIS. Mo., April 6.â Special tele
graru.-i lo the Bcripps-McÃae Press Asso
ciation from points along tne river indi
cate that a very threatening condition of
things prevails. At some points the river
is stationary and at others it is actually
falling, but everywhere there is the feel
ing that tne worst has not yet arrived,
and news from higher points on the river
seem to confirm these forebodings.
At Helena, Ark., and at Greenville,
Miss., where the water has been so high,
it is now going down, but the subsidence
will probably be but temporary. Further
soutn, at Natchez, the river is siowly ris
ing, and lhe greatest anxiety prevails.
The Levee Commission at Natchez has
issued :i warning predicting the worst
overflow in the history of this country,
and entreating every man and boy in that
part of the State to suspend all business
and bemn work strengthening and raising
the levees to meet the expected deluge.
This advice is belli* taken, and work on
an extensive scale 'will probably be put
into O| eration in that part of the State.
Another place where there is the great
eÂ«t anxiety is at fct. Joseph. Mo., where
the weter is already dangerously high and
slill rising.
At Kansas City the river is almost up to
the danger line and is steadily rising. Un
less some change occurs quickly extensive
floods will occur on the lowlands all along
the river.-
The news from New Orleans is of an en
couraging character. At all the weak
points along the river the levees have been
strengthened and preparations have been
made to transfer material quickly to any
part that may be threatened with a break.
Ah to the city levees there is no anxiety,
for the water that may come down can be
easily handled, and a break in them ia not
considered possible.
VERMILLION, 8. D.. April o\â The
flood emerging from the Jim River has at
las! come in sight of this city. From an
eminence can be seen a vast sheet of
water just above the Lee and Prentiss
farms, twe miles from here, reaching from
bluff to bluff. But one train reached bere
from the East to-day and yesterday and it
was unable to go further west. No trains
from the West have reached this city
since last Thursday.
The tracks of the Chicago, Milwaukee
and tit Paul Railway are washed out as
far eaat as Mecklen, six miles west of
h'-re. and that village is under wa;er. At
Gayville, fiiteen miles above, the people
are taking refuge in the top storiecs of
their houses. Much stock and property
will be destroyed on the bottoms between
the Vermillion and Missouri rivers, as the
bridges which were washed out by the re
cent Hood have not been replaced, cutting
off all avenue of escape.
WASHINGTON. DL C, April 6.â Late
this afternoon President McKinley and
Secretary Algor had a conference about
the proposed message to Congress recom
mending Federal relief for the flood suffer
ers in the Southwest. They examined
and discussed the Bate resolution, which
passed tne Senate yesterday, making
available the "epiienuc fund" for the
purchase of supplies to succor the dis
tressed people, and finally came to a prac
tical agreement that this resolution re
moved the necessity, etc., to tae end. The
President will not leave Washington on
his outinc until the liate resolution or
some other relief measure has been signed.

THEY MAY FIGHT AGAIN.
It Is Said That F/ zsmmons Will Yet
Consent to Have Another Battle
Wi h Corbett.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 6 âFor the
past few days the local sports have tieard
rumors of another fight between Corbett
ana Fitzsimmons. From a supposedly
authentic source comes a story that Fitz
simmons will shortly reconsider his "re
tirement" and will apree to meet Corbett
in a battle to be foug t in this State
under the existing provisions of the Hor
ton boxing laws.
It is also reported that both pugilists,
with the aid of their backers, will manage
the entire affair, dividing the receipts and
receiving the benefit of all perquisites,
such as the kinetoscope feature.
A certain authority who is very close to
Fitzsiminona said yesterday: "All this
talk about Fi:z-imraons winning the fight
in Carson on a fluke has its effect on the
Cornishman. Bob's ratirement was a
hasty move, and nobody knows it better
than he and Julian.
"Corbett's excuses ana statements that
he is still tlÂ«e better man are slowly but
surely convincing Fnzsimmons that it
will be to hi-< advantage to meet Jim again
aiid beat him ev^n morn decisively than at
Carson. Const quently it is a good" bet that
the Cornishman. alter a cenain length ot
time, will come out of his retirement and
agree to take on Corbett again.
â¢'From what I hear it would not be a
surprise to me if they meet again in the
ring inaide of the next twelve months,
and it is a fact that their immediate
friends are talking of making a match to
be decided in New York Siate. This would
mean that they could not fight to a finish,
but could meet in a bout limited to twenty
rive rounds. As regards the purse money,
I consiaer that no particular sum will be
hung up, as the principals wouid be the
proprietors of the areaa in which they
meet.
"in other words, trie report reaches me
ihat Corbett, Fitzsimmons and their re
spective backers intend to buill a big
arena somewhere nortti of this city's lim
its, probably in Westchester County. In
this way they would come J n for tne en
tire net receipts, which would be divided
between the men on a private basis of per
centage. They would have no side bet
posted, as that would be against the law,
and Hih referee would have power to stop
the affair when in his estimation it be
came brutal.
"An additional *rake off,' it is said,
would be another set of pictu-es by a ma
chine to be controlled entirely "by the
pugilists. I also Hear that tney feel con
fident of having no interference rom the
authorities, because, they argue, iheir
fight would be nothing more than a glove
contest."

BALTIMORE. Md, April 6.â Chairman
Albert Mott of the racing board, L. A. W.,
to-day made a ruling that will create a
stir among wheelmen. Hereafter road
racine will be under the auspices of the
Century Road Club, end nil classes of
riders ere permitted to enter them. Here
after class lines will be strictly drawn in
such event', and amateurs who enter such
races with professionals will incur the
usual penalties.
The ruling was in connection with a pro

of this city on EasterÂ« Monday. â  Among
the entries was one man who had ben n
suspended for two years by the L. A. W.,
six professionals and a score of amateurs.
Mr. Mott wrote the promoters that the
suspended man and professionals would
have to be excluded or the ameteurs
would be placed in the professional class.
The race will probably be called off. |
The chairman, declares that this ruling
prevails in all cases and will result in
dividing this class of racing into profes

OF THE SENATE
Morgan Argues the Plea
for Recognition of
the Cubans.
Says That Hale of Maine Gets
His Information From
Spaniards.
The Alabma Statesman Condemns
the Barbarous Fo'icy of the
Spanish Officers.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 6.â Two
of the appropriation bills which failed last
sessionâ the sundry civil and Indian â
were reported to-day and were placed on
the calendar, soon to be acted upon.
(Senator Morgan's resolution recognizing
a state of war in Cuba and extending bel
ligerent rights to both sides in the con
flict was taken up and discussed until 2
o'clock, when it was placed on the calen
dar, with a notification that Morgan would
move to take it up to-morrow and that the
vote on the motion would be regarded as
a teat vote.
In the course of his speech Morgan inti
mated that the Senator from Maine (Hale),
who wa-< challenging some of hi& asser
tions, was in constant communication
with representatives of the Spanish Gov
ernment and got his information from
them.
Hale denied the charge and said be got
his information of affairs in Cuba from
Americans who bad been there â Ameri
cans by name, by descent and by resi
dence.
Morgan confessed, after the experience
of the last four years, cc was utterly hope
less that any administration of the United
States would rench the point of sending
warships to Cuba to demand redress for
our citizens. He cited the case of Dr.
Ruiz, stating that he bad information
that Consul-Ger.erai Lee had reported that
he had been murdered by tbe Spanish
authorities.
"If t';is were true," said Morgan, "in
stead of hunting up a lawyer to go to
Cuba and hunt up evidence sucli as might
be iaid before a grand jury, I wou.d have
sent a warship to demand indemnity and
the punisnment of the officials guilty of
the murder."
Speuking generally of the course of the
war in Cuba Morgan condemned in strong
terms the action of the SpaniÂ»n forces in
destroying properly not for military pur
poses but ior resentment, and in executing
prisoners of war. He spolce of the fact
that Spain had recOi-'nizea the Southern
confederacy and accorded it belligtrnnt
rights even before the battle of Manassas
was lought or the Southern States had
made any display of their strength. He
therefore argued that the United States
would be perfectly justified in recognizing
a state of public war in Cuba and pro
claiming neutrality between tbe contest
ants a<Â« was proposed by nis resolution.
At 2 p m. Morgan was shut off by the
regular order, the bankruptcy bill, and
his resolution went back to me calendar;
but he gave notice that he would continue
his remarks in the morning hour to
morrow and demand a sest vote on the
passage of the resolution recognizing
Cuban belligerency and proclaiming neu
trality.
The remainder of the day's se-pion was
given to debate on the bankruptcy bill.
Stewan (Pop.) of Nevada oc-rjpied the
floor for three hours and a half in opposi
tion to the principle of involuntary bank
ruptcy and drifted into the question of
bimetallism, during which he an,d Chan

tertaining dialogue.
At 4:30 o'clock the Senate adjourned.

when one is injured ail wiil labor together
to escape from that injury. Bui some are
so situated as not to be affected by condi

RIVERSIDE, Cal., April 6. âSheriff
Johnson and a posse, who are out in the
mountains in pursuit of Jose Morales, the
murderer of Deputy Sheriff Wilson of Los
Angeles County, and Antonio Sepulveda.
an ex-convict who is wanted in that
county for norse-stealinfc, had a lively
brush with the outlaw* to-aay. A tele
pram was received at noon from Sheriff
Johnson, which stated that the Sheriff
and bis deputies had overtaken Morales,
Sepulveda ami others and fifteen shots
had been exchanged between the pursued
and the pursuers.
in tbe scrimmage Sepulveda's horse
was wounded, but the gang got away.
The two principals separated and went In
different directions. Sheriff Johnson in
structed his deputies to wire the Sheriff
and constables at Colton, Banning and
other points which the desperadoes would
be likely to reach, ana tbe officers at
these places have been notified to be on
the alert for the escaping bandits.
Morales and Sepulveda, with a number
of ether Mexican fugitives from justice,
have been camp d in tbe mountains in
the vicinity of Temecula for some time,
and since they have been there a large
number of cattle and horses have beeu
sto'en in this vicinity. To-day's fight is
â proof th.tt they are desperate men, and
bloods ed is expected before a capture is
t-ffected. Nothing has been heard from
the Sheriff aince this morning's telegram,
and it is possible that another fight has
taken place.
MURDER AT HARRISON GULCH.
Cfficers Smuggle an Assass/n Away at
Night to Prevent a Lynching by
Miners.
RED BLUFF, Cal., April 6.â Another
murder has been committed within the
limits of Shasta Comity and to-night the
County Jail at Redding holds within its
walls another beins; suspected of having
taken the life of a fellow human. The
scene of this last tragedy is the flourishing
Harrison Gulch mining camp, in the
extreme western part of that county.
Albert Weingarden is a miner living in
a ccbin at the town of Harrison Gulch.
He and his 14-year-old eon. J. A. Wein
garden, occupied the cabin together. Near
their cabin was one occupied by William
Vof::. the victim of . the killing. r -The two
men have been Quarreling for some time
paÂ«r.
Weinearden hnd Vosz arrested for cut
tine timber on Government land a short
time ago. He was taken to Ono and
there released by a Justice of the Peace.
On returning to Harrison Gulch he went
to his catkin and founii that it had been
inclosed by a fence, presumably by Wein
garden. He went to Harrison Gulch and
swore out a warrant for the arrest of his
assailant. Alter remaining at the mining
camp a short while he returned to the
cabin and ::gain commenced tearing the
fence away. While thus engaged Wein
garden tired upon him with n Winchester
rifle. While in a stooping posture, one of
the bullets struck Vo-z in the breast,
rauee'l downward and came out of his
back, killing him instantly.
Two men who were on a sidehill a short
distance away heard the shots, and upon
looking up saw VoÂ«z fall. They also saw
a puff of smoke Issuine from the door of
the cabin occupied by Weingarden. One
of the men Â«at on the hillside and watched
the cabin while his partner went to Harri
son Gulch and summoned help. A posse
was made up and sturted for the scene of
the dime. The cabin whs surrounded
and Weingarden captured without any
resistance, he apparently being the cool
est man of the crowa, not seeming to real
ize or care for what he had done.
Wi en he was taken to Harrison Gulch
and the news became general tin* Sturdy
misers became excited over the affair and
stood. in groups talking it over. The offi
cers became convinced that unless they
got their man out of the vicinity there
would be a necktie party. Stage-driver
Henry, who drives the stage between this
ace and tbe mines, was summoned, and
the trouble explained to him. After hear
ing the statements of the officers the
driver induced them to attempt to Let
Weingarden to Red Bluff. He hitched up
hi* team at 10 o'clock Monday night and
V.'einzarden was slipped from his place of
confinement and put into tbe stage.
Henry then applied the lash to his
horses and struck out down the mountain
road a- fast as he could drive. He drove
all night and arrived with his man in Rel
Bluff juÂ«t before the train started for Red
ding this afternoon. WHngarden was put
on board and taken to Reddinp, the crime
having been committed in. Shasta county.
Weingaraen is well known in Red Bluff
ant! is considered to be a very quarrelsome
man. He owned a small ranch one mile
east of here and.was continually having
trouble with his neighbors, impounding
tbeir stock and doing many other thine*
to bring himself into disfavor. He worked
in Lvonsvilie some time and was also
quarrelsome there. Those who know him
in Red Muff <ionotseem surprised at what
he has done.
A Coroners jury was summoned at
Harrison Gulch to investigate the murder,
and after bearing Hip r-vidence it brought
in a verdict to the effect that Vosz came
to his death from gun-shot wounds in
flicted by some person unknown to them.
The evidence of the two men on the hill
and of other persons leaves little doubt.
however, that Weingarden fired the fatal
shot. Tne dead man ta not known here,
but at Harrison Gulch he is said to have
been a <ju;et man.

LOS ANGELES DIVORCE CASE.
Action Brought by Mrs. W Herd, an Heiress
Who Married a "Btauiy Doctor"
Ft k^r.
LOBANGEIiBS, Cal.. April 6.-Society
here is taking considerable interest in the
divorce suit of Ellen M. Willard against
her husband, i'rank A. Willard. The
Willard familyâ Frank, his father, a
brother and his nrother's wifeâ gained
notoriety here about a year and a half
ago by being arrested for conducting a
"Beauty Doctor" fake. ThÂ» y used the
mails for fraudulent purpo-rs and several
of them were given sentences in the Santa
Barbara {ail. Mrs. Ellen M. Willard was
not, however, implicated.
Mrs. Willard married in Dixon, 111., in
1830, much agamsi tbe wishes of her
parents, who were wealthy people.
Shortly after their marriage the husband
began to tire, apparently, of his bargain,
and grew angry because his wile's father
would not respond with ducats with ihe
generosity he appeared to bel.eve was due
him as the son-in-law oi a rich man.
Willard des-erted his wife and lived apart
from her for several years, but in I*B4 c
returned and they went to live in Michi
gan. Five years later they came to Cali
fornia.
During all the time Willard had been
abusing bis wife in many ways, *o she de
clares, and especially directed his spite
and contumely aeainst her fattier and
other members of her lamily. Willard,
s-be says, would frequently express the
desire that her father mien t die in order
that they could get hold of some of the
property. Willard's residence on the
coast did not apparently :ibate his kindly
regard for his lather-in-law, and he would
say to Mrs. Willard that the old man was
Â«low about dymp, and as each day passed,
that, it was just that much shorter time
to wait.
Finally, tiring of his abuse, she tooK
their four children and went to a house
in East Los Angeles. She asks for the cus
tody of tbe children along with tbe di
vorce.
TRAGEDY AT LOS ANGELES.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 6â An at
tempt at suicide with most shocking re
sults was made here early this morning.

on East Fifth ;-treet. Other lodgers dis
covered fire issuing from Miss Fayle's
room, broke open the door and extin
guished the flumes. When they entered
Miss Fayles lay on a bed which was on
fire, a3 was her clothing, a combination
undersuit. The room adjoining was abliize.
The woman was seemingly oblivious to
tbe terrible burns she had suffered. Tlie
lower portion of her undersuit was burned
away and the flesh was horribly scorched.
The poor victim, with an insane smile on
her face, seemed not to notice the tortur
intr pain. The county ambulance was
called and she was removed to the hos
pual. She may recover.
Miss Fayles has been a guest at the
lodging-house since last October, comiue
from San Francisco. Formerly she lived
a* Tacorca, Wash., where siie taught

Y. She is about 27 years old, and an
industrious and discreet young woman of
irreproachable character. Siie is highly
educated and refined, a frequenter of the
public library and was studying to get a
teacher's position here.
Dr. Barber, at the County Hospital,
says the patient is insane, and she has
had to be placed in a straitjacket to
keep her in bed. She says she is Christ
and that the fire cannot burn her, because
ii could not burn him.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 7, 1897.
PASS ING OF THE
WARLIKE MODOCS
Captain Jack's Celebrated
Band Decimated by
Starvation.
Pitiful Plight of the Remnant
Remaining on Northern
Ranges.
Fully a Fourth of Their Number
Succumbed to the Hardships
of a Rigorous Winter.
REDDING, Cal., April 6.â H. S. Me-
Coy, who has been riding the ranges in
Modoc County, i? in Redding to-day. He
telis of the pitiable condition of the hand
ful of the celebrated tribe of Modoc In
dians which live in that section. Ordi
narily the reds have been able to sustain
themse.ves during the summer by work
ing on the hay ranches and in the winter
by cutting and hauling wood. This win
ter baa been unusually severe and they
have been hard pressed to pet a bare snb
smier.ce. McCoy reports that last fall
there remained but 100 of Captain Jack's
i tribe in the neighborhood of the massacre
i of 1872, and that because of the severe
weather and the hardships of the past
mouih the number have been still more
greatly reduced. All toid there are about
' 400 Indians of various tribes in the entire
county.
In 1873. at the clo^e of the war, the
Modocs were taken to Indian Territory.
There were a score or more who escaped
the enticing wiles of Uncle Sam's Com
missioners, and in a quarter of a century
this remnant, left in peace, had grown to
the number of ICO. The ravages by hun
ter and exposure this winter has reduced
this number, Mr. McCoy estimates, at
1 east one-quaner. The condition oi the
survivors is wretched, and they appar
ently feast witu relish upon the carcasses
of cattle that have strayed from their
corrals and pÂ«ris;ied.
The present straits of the hniel de
scendants oi Captain's Jack's followers re
call the history of that famous chief, who
in 1872 and 1873 caused the Government
much trouble. It was a famous war. Ac
cording to the reports made after it was
all over the Modocs had but forty-six men
capable of bearing arms when the war
commenced. Five braves.three squaw* and
two boys lost their lives. On the Govern
ment side 150 soldiers were killed and
wounded, and the war cost $300,000.
The tragedy of the struggle was the
treachery ot Captain Jack, ivno on April
11. 1873, when under a flag of truce, gave
the warwhoop and shot General Can by
dead. Can by fell upon the rocks and was
then stabbed in tbe neck with a km IV, as
a butcner kills a hog, and was then
stripped of his clothing and left naked on
the lava. Dr. Tnomas was likewise killed
at this time.
For three days after that the United
State 9 troops had Captain Jack's litti*
band ' e mined up in the lava tields near
Tule Lake, pouring shot and shell upon
them when they could catch sight of
them. Not a Modoc was slain, and tbe
whole band escaped to a stronger position
six miles southward. Three different
times the troops had their bands upon
Jack and he was not there.
Finally on June 4. 1873, more than six
months after the first tight, the war closed
Captuin Jack, Sconcbin John, Boston
Charley, Black Jim.Wacthinateand Shlox
were tried by court martial ami sentenced
to death.
Scar-faced Charley was elected chief of
! those who went to Indian Territory.
I Those left in Modoc County have lonir aeo
; given up their tribal relation and have
! lived peaceably on the verge oi civiliza
j lion, picking up a precarious and uncer
! tain living from cd.l job* given them by
i the whites in tbe sparsely settled region
'< in the northeastern corner of California.
! Never laying by any stores for a rainy
I day, they were not prepared to meet the
privations of the past winter, and spring
', linds their ranks so reduced that soon the
j Modocs will figure only in history.
ARIZONA'S POLITICAL WAR.
Governor Frank In Holds That an Act
Passed by the Legislature Over
His Vito Is Invalid.
PHfENIX, Ariz, April Â«.â There is
more trouble brewing between the mem
bers of thÂ» Nineteenth Legislature and
Governor Franklin. The latter announced
to-day that he would take the position
that the salary reinstatement act passed
over his veto was illegal and invalid. At
the same time Attorney General Wilson
tiled a formal opinion declaring the act
invalid, chiefly on the ground that it was
retroactive. Governor Franklin declares
the bill invalid because Cowan o: Mohave,
an ex-county oHici.il and therefore a bene
ficiary under the act, cast the decisive
vote when the bill was passed over the
executive veto.
If the act stands the test in the courts
it will entail an expense of about |40,0C0
on the counties. It provides for th* pay
ment of back salaries of county cfncial
wtio served during 1886418, and allows
tb*m a-< much money m their p-eJeces
sors were paid. This action is based upon
nn error in tbe engrossment of the si ary
reduction bill passed by the Eighteenth
L 'iri'lature, whereby the act went into
effect two year? before it was intended by
its f-am.-rs to become operative, and re
dncad the salaries of officials already in
office. For two years thin has been one of
i he greatest bones of contention in the
Territory, and now the matter will bo
fought out in the courts.
FIGHT FOR A PORTLAND ESTATE.
Former Employers of a Missing Man Liy
Claim to His Savings of a
Lifetime.
PORTLAND. Or.. April 6.â About two
years ago Anton Morten*en, an omploye
of the Portland Ice Company, suddenly
disappeared from this city, and since then
there has been no clew to his whereabouts.
Soon after his departure the disclosure
was made that he had $5300 in gold coin
with a local safe deposit company. His
late employers then *et up a claim to the
money on the alleged ground that he had
embezzled it from them, but that seems
impossible, as he had been in their em
piov for two years only, and in order to
collect the sum on deposit he would have
had to steal $9 per day, which was more
tljHii he took in.
Morten^en's parents, to whom this sum
of money means mucti, have causeu the
Danisli Consul liure to interest himself in
the case. He is gathering evidence to
prove that when Mortenssn went to work
for the ice company he had already saved
the money found. There will be a bitter
tight for the estate, but the impression is
that the heirs will get what is left of it at
the end of the promised litigation.
It is not believd that Morten sen volun
tarily left here, as he hud no occasion so
to do. Had he gone voluntarily he would
not have left bis little fortune behind him,

that he was shangnni'd and killed or ac

IN JAIL AT SAN RAFAEL.
Millionaire Fnigan Still Rifuses to Pay
His Wile Alimony as Ordered by
the Court.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., April 6.âMillion
aire Peter A. Fiiiigan, tt.e defendant in
the sensational divorce suit commenced
by Mrs. Emily B. Finiean, spent last
night in a cell in the County Jail as the
star boarder of Sheriff Harrison. Despite
the millionaire's wealth his attorneys
could not induce the Supreme Court to
listen to his application ior a writ of ha
beas corpun yesterday afternoon because
that body was engaged with other affairs.
So Colonel Finigan was compelled to ac
cept his fate, and instead of spending the
night in his elegantly furnished apart
ments at the Hotel Rafael, he slept on one
of the rii'le couches in the County Jail.
And all t"-day the colonel has been con
fined in his cell. His meals have been
sent lo the prison lrom a hotel near by,
but the millionaire has not complained.
He does not relish his lot, out is making
the best of a bad position. He is cheer
ful, but still Judge Angelotti s order re
quiring nlm to pay $750 to his wife as ali
mony has not been complied with, and
until it is, or the Supreme Court grants
him a writ of babe** corpus, he will re
main in the County Jail.
The colonel still persists that he has not
the money to comply with the order re
quiring him to pay $760 aiimony to his
wife.

large quantities of bay, which the high
water, coming very suddenly, washed
away. Many bridges and miles of fence
are gone. Farmers will be benefited by
having their land thoroughly moistened,
and if it becomes dry enough to worn this

REDWOOD CITY, Cau, April 6 -If
there ever were any doubts as to the abil
ity of tbe Native Sons of Redwood C;ty to
entertain the Grand Parlor in a befitting
manner, they are entirely dispelled by this

Â«ntertainine time during tlie>r stay here.
The reception accorded them will be of
the highest character. Everything meted

SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 6.â Since
his return from the Legislature, Senator
D. H. Trout of B >uMer, who represents
jointly Santa Cruz and San Mateo coun
ties, and holds the position of Deputy
County Assessor, has been subjected to
some criticism by his constituents for the
part he took iq the reduction of salaries
by the passage of the county government
act. Auditor E 1 Martin yesterday refused
to draw Trout's warrant for services as
Deputy Aseessor, and sought an opinion
lrom District Attorney Lindsay.
The District Attorney held that in the
absence of a direct law* or constitutional
provision upon the subject the common
law rule should guloe; and that the com
mon law plainly pointed out tne incom
patibility of one person holding two
offices.
Mr. Trout was appointed Deputy As
sessor in March 1595, and was elected
Senator lust November. The deputy's
salaiy is $100 a momh for four months of
the year, payable at the counter of the
County Treasurer upon a warrant drawn

FOUND HANGING IN
HIS PRISON CELL
Kleupfer, the Newhope Mur
derer, Anticipates
the Law.
His Life Choked Out by a Noose
Formed From a Silken
. Handkerchief.
Was Awaiting Trial at Stockton for
Killing Two Men While
Cr z:d by Liquor.
STOCKTON, Cal., April C. â Charles
Francis Kleupfer, who slew Charles R.
Dodge and Alexander Borland at New
hope on February 2, was to have been
brought into court this morning to have
the date set for his trial for the murder of
Dodge, but when the rays of the sun
peeped into the cell through the iron
grating of the small window he was seen
to have passed beyond the jurisdiction of
any earthly court. J. B. Broulette was in
the cell with Kleup'er, and when he
awoke at the first light of day he saw the
body of his cellmate banging from the
cell bars.
Kleupfer hanged himself early this
morning â perhaps shortly after midnight.
It was nearly 12 o'clock before Boulette
fell asleep, and the body of Kleupfer was
cold when seen by him at about 4:30
o'clock.
The manslayer had meditated the deed
for days, and, perhaps, since his impris
onment began. lie made all preparations
with the greatest care. So quietly did he
kill himself that lor several hours after he
had ceased breathing the man in the cell
with him slept on, while those in the cell
opposite heard no noise, no groan, no
struggle.
He rolled the mattress up in a heap and
placed it on the floor, under the window.
He then took his "blankets, folded them
and placed them on too of the mattress.
Then he tied a red silk handkerchief under
his jaw and over his head, so as to keep
hia mouth closed. That wes done so that
he could not cry out or groan. He then
tied another red silt handkerchief about
his neck and fastened the other end to the
second bar from the top of the window, i
His preparations completed, he let his |
feet slide from the blankets, having first I
thrown a towel over his face.
In this way Kteupfer hanged himself |
and ended all. The anxiety of a tedious
trial, the worry and the fret and the dis- 'â¢
erace of it all were not to be borne by him.
He probably died without a struggle, for
the towel, that had been just thrown over
his head and allowed to hang over his ]
face, had not fallen off. His arms hung !
loosely at Lis sides.
When Brouletto awoke and saw the i
body af his cellmate hanging from the
bars, he called for the jaiier, and Deputy I
Hanks went down to the cell. He did '
not look in, for he little dreamed that he
had been called to cut down the body of
the Newhope prisoner. Broulette called !
again, ana this time Hanks looked into !
tne cell and saw the dangling corpse.
The Sheriff's office was notified, the Dis- I
trict Attorney and the Coroner were sum- i
moned, and upon the arrival of Deputies j
Jory and Shuster the body was cut down
and taken to the morgue. Letters wÂ«re I
foun d that had been written to the Coro
ner, to Jailer Benjamin, to the prisoner's
brother, who arrived here yesterday from
Custer, Idaho, and to J. G. Swinnerton,
the prisoaer's attorney. The letter to the
Coroner merely requested him to give hit !
body to his brother.so that it might be in- j
terred in Oakland. The letters to tbe at- '
torney and the prisoner's brother were re- I
garding private business affairs.
Charles F. Kleupfer was awaiting trial
for the murder of Charles R. Dodge and
Alexander Borland at Newhope, on the
night of February 2. Dodge and Borland
were in the hotei kept by Arthur Thorn
ton, when Kleupfer entered. He had evi
dently been drinking, and immediately
began to raise a disturbance. His conduct
became so objectionable that those present
remonstrated, but this only made the man
worse and he became very boisterous.
Dodge and Borland endeavored to in- |
duce him to leave the place, but he would '
not go. They then assisted in an attempt I
to eject him, but Keupier showed fignt, I
and drawing Ms pistol tired two shots, I
both of which took effect. One bullet
struck Dodge in the hfad and the other
pierced Borland's skull, each penetrating
the brain. Neither man spoke after the !
bullet struck him, both expiring within a
few moments.
After the shooting Kleupfer ran across
the street and barricaded himself in his
room. There he defied arrest until olli
cers arrived from Stockton, when he sub
mitted. He was brought to Stockton hur
riedly, there being reason to fear that a
lynching tnight be attempted.

--cent lay. This maUe me sore and I deter
mined to escape.
"In May. we put in at Sachalien Island,
the principal Russian convict settlement.
I thou'ht it was on the Russian mainland
and not far from Vlariivostock, v; hence I
thought I could easily ship, so I deter
mined to get away. After rilling the
water casks, a number of us were allowed
to go ashore on a hualing expedition, and
I slipped away ani remained in the woods
until the vessel >ailod.
"After breakfasting on hard tact and
corn beef, whicn I had brought with me,
I made my way toward smoke which I
found rose from the house of a Japanese
iisherman. As 1 could speak a little
Japanese, I Â«oon discovered that I was on
an island, and in hope of reaching civiliza
tion, prevailed on tne fisherman to take
me to the interior, where a short, dark
people called the Inos lived. Here was a
military station occupied by live P.uÂ«sian
soldiers, who, after questioning me, placed
me under arrest.
"I was confined in a hut and fed on
black bread and soup, and at the end of
two and a half days was taken over the
mountains to a bi,' place called Karasa
kciff, where prisoners were engaged in
building fortifications. Ttie authorities
could not at first understand me, but.
through a Japanese, I explained that 1
had been accidentally left on the island.
The Kussians did not believe me, but sent
me by s'.eamer to the Governor of the
island, at a place called Aleiandros, 300
miles away. Before going I was trea>ed
as a prisoner, being ooiiged to get out
timber, eat black bread, potatoes and fish.
"I reached Alexandros in irons, and on
telling my story to the Governor, whose
name I did not learn, was informed that I
was a nihilist and a spy, hut that my case
would be investigated. I referred him to
American Consul Abercrombie at Na
gasaki, and in the meantime I was con
fined in the big pmon without work,
being given the freedom of the prison
yard.
"At the end of two weeks 1 complained
of the restraint and food, and was given
50 copecks or % a rouble a day and allowed
the freedom oi the town, having to get the
money every morninj from the Governor's
house and report every night before sun
down at the prispn. There were then
about 1400 convicts there, guarded by 800
soldiers.
"In tbe course of my weary walks about
I discovered a village of Japanese fisher
men near by, and they told me the Gov
ernor would never release me. But one
day a Japanese fishing- junk put in and I
recognized the captain as an old acquaint
ance of Nagasaki. He proposed that I
escape, and at his suggestion 1 stowed
away in a fish barret and was brought
safely to Nagasaki, whence Consul Aber
crombie enabled me to ship to Yokohama
and thence to Victoria, B. O.

COMPAHY K'S EXERCISES.
Vational Guardemen Who Show Trofl-
oiency in I>rill.
There was a large number of the friends
of Company X, First Infantry, Second
Brigade, Captain T. J. Cunningham com
manding, in the armory of the Nationals
last night to witness the members of the
company give &n exhibition of the phys
ical exercise witu arms.
This is a new exercise recently intro
dnced in the United Slates army and has
been practiced by the troops in the depart
ment of Missouri, and will soon be intro
duced in the department of California.
Captain Cunningham learned of this
new exercise, and becoming acquainted
with the movements instructed the men
of his command in them, and tbe exhibi
tion last night was the first given by a
company of the National Guard.
Owine to the contracted size or the drill
hall but thirty-two men could participate.
After a short drill in company movements
the men opened ranks and took positions
so as to form four lines.
At the word of command they grounded
arms, recovered, then removed b Us and
accouterments, recovered their p.ecas, and
from attention they obeyed the order to
port arms. Then they grasped the piece
w ith both hand, at tne upper end of the
stock and near the muzzle, and went
through a number of movements, keeping
time to piano music.
The movements, consisting of raising
the piece above the head, bringing it
down, thrusting it forward, and other?,
were executed with remarkable precision,
showing careful attention to instructions,
and the effect was very pretty. This ex
hibition, which lasted about twenty min
utes, won for the members of Company X
much applause.
Before dismissa I, Captain Cunnineham
presented to the winners the bars they
had won at the Sta;e shoot. The winners
of the second class are:
Lieutenant C. W, Seeley, Corporal J. L.
Utschig and Privates B. D. Hoffman and
E, Jackson. Third -classâ Captain T. J.
Cunningham, Lieutenant E. D. Finley,

D. T. de liardini. \V. F. Hanly and E.
Schmalz. The buttons awarded to the
men who formed part of the team that
won the trophy from the Hawaiin Guards
men were then distributed.
SAN FRANCISCO SUITS OTIS SKINNER.
A bracing morning â not too earlyâ a
good pair of trotters, a little chat, then I
heard California praised â praised as you
read in picture-booksâ praised by the
author, the picturesque, romantic actor,
Otis Ssinner.
Just entering the hair-way house, be
tween 30 and 40, Mr. Skinner has won
fame anil fortune singularly. Yet he
lakes it corneJyâ no struts, no sniffs of
nose, no affectation. He is American,
glad he is, and deports himself as he is.
Said he, falling into the easy conversation
way: "Our climate in California cannot
be excelled the world over. We have the
best fruit, the best flowers, the best wine,
which is constantly getting a bigeer repu
tation. By the way, I want to tell you

great claims as a Peruvian Monte Cnsto.
lies in the City Prison charged in a gen
eral way with issuing a bogus check for
$2 and palming it off on his landlord, Ed
ward Strauss, of 1149 Mission street.
Silver's stories of fabuious gold mines
in the laud of the Incas created a great
deal of excitement in mining quarters,
particularly because there are mining men
here who know that rich deposits abound
in the regions named by Silver.
The man has no money now, and he
says his previous claims were jokes pure
and simple.
"I may be a dreamer," he said between
sobs, "but if laml am ati honest one. I
have not deceived any one to do him any
harm, and I be.ieve 1 can get caDital in
terested and make a fortuneâ provided
this arrest uas not spoiled it all. For ray
self I do not care so much, but I have a
boy 11 years old, and 1 am sorry on his
account," and the big. rough-looking man
wept copiously as i>e spoke.
Silver does not seem to be a dangerous
swindler. He is probably a Colonel Sel
lers with a lew drops of evil blood to add
a tinge of crime to his plans.
"I have been just where I say I've been,"
he said, "and I have deeds to mines there,
but I do not propose to surrender them to
the detective?. They are mine."
Silver was formerly a lawyer, practicing
in Alameda. He was arrested and tried
for presenting falm affidavits in a con
tempt case n: 1889, in a matter wherein
Georgn B. Tappan was interesied. He
was sentenced for five year-, went to Sun
Quentin on October 31, IbÃ9, and was par
doned by Governor Marknam January 26,
1892. In 1889 he said he was 38 years old!
Speaking of his trouble in Aiamtda yes
teraay, he said: "I was not givan a fair
show. A previous jury acquitted me in
Juuge Gibson's court, but when I came be
lore Judge Greene it went the other way."
â N. W. Snow, a raining man at 330 Pine
street, met Sliver a year aco, at a time
when he (Snow) was looking lor a man of
means to join him and his brother in a
mining den . He says Silver pretended
10 havo $tio,ooo in bank, which he liad ob
tained irom a mine in Mexico.
"We spent a week preparing a contract
with him," -aid Mr." Snow, "and at the
last moment he quit negotiating, on the
flimsy pretext that he aid not know us.
He then disappeared for a long time and
arrived here a month or so atro, claiming
thai he had struck it rich. He made his
headquarters at our oflice and advertised
for a young lndy to go down to his mines
as Bookkeeper. He proposed to her and
she accepted with a proviso that saved

is a good way to advertise the State a3 a
'health resort.'
"Now, I have heard many people speak
of Joy's Vegetable Sarsapanlla, ana from
my own experience firmly believe it is
a fine spring remedy. I: seems to be
especially efficacious in acute dyspepsia.
Perhaps it would not be a bad idea to
advertise this Californian Sarsaparilla all
over the world. People nowadays are
getting to use these d fferent remedies.
The best families buy them and use them.
Now, if Joy's Vege:abie Sarsaparilla was
known all over the world people wonld
naturally speak more about California â
especially about its climate and its prod
ucts. I should really like to see the State
of California the Mecca for people seeking

could producs evidence of his wealth.'
Silver has no money. He is a cripple
and is shabbily dressed. He impresses
one as a weaK character rather than as a
bold bad man.
E. U. Dodge, who was one of a company
of men who intended goir.z to South
America to prospect for gold, said last
night: "Of course I know this man George
\V. Silver, and I and our part/ discovered
that he is about as fine a romancer as they
make.
"In the latter part of last January he
presented himsel i at the residence of Joe
Johnson Hyde street. You know Johns
used to be a serereant of police here, and
'left a short tims since with a company of
prospectors for South America, and must
be at Panama by this time.
'â¢Well, in the presence of Johns. John
Stafford, my brother. 11. B. Dodge, Mc-
Murty an ex- policeman,- Hat/an, Mc-
Cready, Waltz and about twenty more,
who were to form a comoany to search lor
gold, Silver told a story very similar to
that which he told a reporter for The
Call, and he laid particular stress upun
what he declared was an absolute fact,
and that was that pome one had in the
night stolen a 27-pound nugget from bis
s'.uicebox. He also told us that his cabin
was built on 3 placer claim, but that it
was washed away by a freshet, and that
when the water subsided he coulJ go ov.t
the placer and pick up sold by the hand
ful. It was a pretty story and he is a
plausible story-teller.
"After he had spun his yarn it set those
who heard it to thinking and discussing,
and afterward a quiet investigation was
started, and AlcMurty, who was the most
active in the matter, reported that the in
vestigation proved that it takes not less
than live weeks to reach the nearest point
to the place wbere the El Dorado is lo
cated. The name is a Spanish one and I
cannot recall it. It was also learned that
it took several days to reach the placer
from the landing point. In addition he
told us that he had been in the City for
some time 'buying hydraulic machinery
to work tne placer.'
"Since the published article appeared
it was ascertained that Silver could not
have had time to go to the point of disem
barkation, to say nothing of going to the
mine, and return to this City, and that is
why I and others nave come to tbe con
clusion that George W. Silver is a ro
mancer."

KING OF ALL.
That is loud praise, but the
great specific for all kinds of
\ nervous. debility that is , owned
alone by the celebrated doctors
of the Hudson Medical Institute
deserves to be called King, for it
is all-conquering. ' It's known as
! "Hudyan," and as well as being
so strong and swift in action it
is perfectly harmless.
TO-DAY
You may be a weak, halt-para-

i grand remedy can do what no
I other remedy canâ stop the mis-
{ chief in a month. Drains do
I cease in ten days â indeed they
DO â and life, light and full, un-

and then you will be one more

"The only thing
IS HUDYAN."
You have but to write to the Insti-

BESTED THE MERCHANTS'
DEPUTATION.
Kneeled to the Minister, Who
Related to Them Their
Misdeeds.
THEY ALL MUST CBEY THE LAW
OR SUFFER.
Awaiting the Installation of tn.9 N.-w
Minister, Who IÂ» Opposed to
the Sam i'ups-
Fung Yung Heng, Consul-General of the
Pacific Coast lor the Emperor of China,
and Vice-Consul King Owyang, who went
lo Washington several weeks ago for the
purpose of interviewing the Chinese Min
ister, Yang Yu. on the condition and
future prospects of the OhinÂ«e colonies of
America, returned to this City last even
ing.
During the Consul's visit at Washington
a deputation of Chinamen, members of
the See Yud Company, with Joseph C.
Campbell, attorney-at-law, arrived in that
city to lay their grievances before the
Minister.
The deputation sought the advice of the
Minister and implored him to assist them
in casting off the "chains of oppression"
with which the Sam Yups baa manacled
them. .
The merchants obtained an audience
with the Minister, but every appeal nnd
proteslation on their port was listened to
by the man accused of oppression, Fung
Yune Heng, and he, assisted by King
Ovvyang, presented a defense so pregnant
with fact and reason that it almost
resulted in the disruption of the great
See Yup company. The merchant* re
mained an hour and a hal: before the
Minister on bended knees and according
to the statements of Fung Yung Heng
were roundly censured for there own mil
deeds and warned against transgressing
the law-* of the United States.
Undaunted, however, they sent back
a flattering report of th-ir success,
and a banquet was given in this City a
lew days ago on the receipt ol the cood
news, while congratulati ;is swam in
chxmpagneand sam shu â a very potent
mixture for Mongolian brains.
The expense or the excursion, likewise
of thft banquet, are to be paid by Chinese
merchants, and the air of Chinatown is
now stuffy with complaints regarding the
puncely manner in "which the members
of the delegation have b?en disporting
themselves in Washington. If they have
to go a block they take a carriage, for cere
mony to the utmost verge of punctilious
ness is the leading characteristic of the
Cninese. Then they must have a large
re;inue of servants in order to impress the
Chinese Minister with the fact that they
represent the "solid Muldoonery 1 ' of the
California Chinese. Naturally their bills
were very high, and there is much discon
tent in yellow circles here because of that
fact, and merchants are raising a loud
protest against paying them.
They are practical people and they ob
ject to pnying money for the purpose of
impressing" a Chinese Minister when his
successor is already on the way here, and
is expected to arrive on the Gaelic, which
is dus next Saturday. If the present Min
ister has been bribed to favor either lac
tion, they argue, what good will it do
when he is going 10 be deposed? He will
then have no authority or weight what
ever, and the whole thing will have to be
done over again. "What's the use of
rucking two bites of a cherry?" they ask.
When the new Minister shall have been
installed in Washington they say that he
will put another man in the place of the
Consul-General in San Francisco. There
iÂ« cause for much rejoicing among the See
Yups, for the new Minister comet from
their district, and is natnrally<supposed to
be in svmpaihy with them. He is, there
fore, expected to appoint as Consul-Gen
eral ai mis port a friend of the See YupÂ«.
"The reports and statements of great
â uccess on the part of the See Yup aeputa
lion which recenilv visitea Washington
are erroneous." said Fung Yung Heng
through King Owyang, who acted sa bis
interpreter, last evening.
"An audience was granted the mer
chants, it is true, but after the Minister
hart listened to tier statements he in
formed them that he was fully aware of
the important part the See Yup Company
played in the recent trouble in
Bin Francisco. He demanded the
commission of certain lawful acts on its
par: before he would assist :t, or intervene
in behalf of relatives of its members in
China who are incarcerated, or whose
prorerty had Deen taKen from them owing
to the murders and crimes charged to the
See Yup Company and its tongs.
"F:r-t the Minister demanded that the
Bee Yap Company no longer enfore tbe
boycott againxt tae Sam Yup?, winch is
the acknowledged keystone to rait and
present difficulties. Second, the gee
Yups were told to dismiss the suit
.â¢gainst the Consul-General, Fung Yung
Heng, for his having ordered the demoli
tion of the See Yup headquarters several
months ago. Third came ihe worst blow
of all. The Minister at fi'si demanded
the disruption of the See Yud Company.
This was too much, and the merchant*,
bowing lower and lower, implore 1
and t ezged that their society be allowed
to exist. Tbe Minister finally consented,
buio^lyon the understating that the
See Yups cast aside certain unlaw
ful sections of their by - laws.
The Minister next demanded that
the See Yups pay the court costs
incurre I in the stiit instituted against the
Consui-Genera). On a plea of poverty
being advanced by the merchants, how
ever, the Minister anain acquiesced, and
the Government of China will assume the
expense of the suit which wiil now be
abandoned."

] Tbe evening was enjoyably spent at ban
quet, with the customary post-prandial ac
companiment of brief and witty remarks.
All the local societies, which comprise
Golden Gate Union, participated, and the
affair was a marked success in every re-^

The spacious lecture-room was filled
with tables well laden with temptinc re
freshments ants decorated with California

the colors of the convention of 1397.
The banquet began at 6:30 p. m., and it
was nearly" 10 o'clock when she u-uests re
luctantly anÂ«l regretfully dispersed.
TLe speeches were limited to three

CARRIED THE DOG.
General Nathaniel T. James' Kindly
A < Toward an Irjured Little
Fox Terrier.
General Nathaniel T. James, manager
of the local branch of the Alliance Assur
ance Company of London, is deserving of
a medal from thÂ« Society lor the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals.
The insurance man is an ardent horse
man and often takes a rids along the
ocean beach accompanied by a handsome
little fox terner that holds a scarcely less
exalted place in his affections than his
horse.
On Monday he took his usual ride with
a co'tple of friends, the merry terr.er
dancing aiong ahead.
Suddenly mere was a yelp of pain from
the do.: as one of the horses and stepped
on it.
Genera! James was out of bis saddle in
a moment, and found that the iron-shod
hoof hud cut two of the terrier's legs to
the bone. Blood was streaming from the
wounds, but the dog's owner took it up in
his arms and, not being ablo to carry the
little thing comfortably on horseback,
turned his animal over to one of his
friends and walked through the park to
where he could get a car and reach the
Citr.
People stared to see the man carrying a
wounded dog in his arms, but they appar
ently understood the case, for they smiled
sympathetically and several inquired how
the accident had happened.
The horseman's riding suit was ruined
before he reached n veterinary surgeon,
â out he feels repaid from tho fact that the
dog is out of danger.
Chief Crowlry Recovered.
Chief Crowley has almost completely recov
ered from the serious attack of ptomaine
poisoning, and will be at his office to-day. lie
was able to sit np a.l yesterday aiiernnon. The
attack was h severe one while it tested, but the

D. If. Carman delivered the address of

and strai^htiorward. H:s greeting was
hospitable and gracefully put. "ifwedo

SERVICES FOR GREECE.
Special Prayers That the Nation Prove
Worthy of Its Fast.
By special consent of Bishop Nicholas
the Greek element of the Greek-Russian
Catholic Church was given the mornine
hour yesterday.
fbe services consisted of a brief re
ligious ceremony, being* prayer for the
â¢uccess of the Greeks. The priest in
charge was a Greek, recently irom Alaska,
and the attendance consisted very largely
of the GreeKs oi the City, but many re
mained away because of the attitude of
tue Russian Government in tue present
crisi?. The tone of the devotions was
quite patriotic and the prayers asked

SCIENCE AND ART
TOOK THEIR TURN
A New, Imposing, Three-
Story Structure on
Post Street.
Wonderful Electrical ApplianC3s
and Telephonic Sys
tem.
The San Francisco Gs and Electric
Company E?tab ished in Its
New Quarters.
The plant and property of ths San
Francisco Gaslight Company and of the
Ellison Light and Power Company have
been sold to a new corporation known as
the San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany- The change hns been inaugurated
by the construction of a palatial three
story stone and brick building at 415 Post
street, above Powell.
The offices of the old companies have
been translerred to the new quarters, and
the business transacted hereafter will be
at tue new address.
The presiient cf the new company is J.
B. Crockett; the secretary, "William G.
Barrett. The board of directors is com
posed of President J. B. Crockett, G. W.
Prescott, Adam Grant. Levl Strauss,
Daniel T. Murphy, J. Downey Harvey, A.
H. Payson, Jumes B. Stetson, \V. F.
Whittier, C. E. Green and P. J. Donahue.
The new building of the corporation is
one of winch tiny City migut well feel
proud. On the principle that a diamond
scarfpin may serve a useful purpose as
well ai to adorn, it has been constructed
in the most magnificent style of modern
art.
Viewed from the front it looms np as a
three-stcry stone strnciure, the two upper
stories being finished in huff brick with
terra-cotta trimmings. Tlie basement
and mam floor are in Raymond granite.
The main floor is partitioned off into sep
arate offices for seven bookkeepers, with
ciusks for collectors and a large office near
Hie central part for the cashier's depurt
ment. Ibe entire finish of this floor is in
Flemish oak, highly polished, with brass
counter-rails and a mosaic floor.
Opening from the cashier's department
is the spacious casii vault. In it the books
of the concern are kept. So perfect is tne
mechanism that a book weighing '.jv pounds
can oe hauled forth with Uo fingers.
Above the vault proper is another vault
17 feet long, in which books and records
are kept.
In tne front of the building on the main
floor ami at the tight of the entrance is
the president's Olfice, titled in modern
style, wuh the secretary's in the rear of it
and the stenographer's room adjoining.
The office and lavatories arc finished in
quartered oak. The wainscoting of tne
lower floor is of Tennessee marble.
T.e c is one elevator in tte building, a
Fraser. Under the compartment for pas
sengers is oi:e for freignt.
On tne second lloor, and directly over
looking Post street, is the board of
directors' room. This room is finished in
Flemish oak. Handsomely carpeted, v it li
iarpe portraits of past officers adorning the
walls.
Ai the eastern end is a fireplace, built to
give a Greek temple effect, it reaches to
â¢.lip ceiling. The capitals of the columns
are lonic. Midway Detween the floor and
ceiling is a French-plate mirror. Pendant
from the ceiling in t c center of the room
is a beautiful chandelier.
Engineer Jones' room is on the north
west corner o! the second floor. It is a
well-equipped engineer's office, finished
iv whue cedar, and ornamented al*o with
a beautiful carpet and chandelier.
Back of the engineer's oilioe is the room
for the use of the engineer's clerks, in
which all the accounts of the manulacture
of gas are kept. In a room to the rear are
kept the maps of the City containing the
location ot street mains and lamp-posts
and a card catalogue of all the meiers in
u^e. Tlie street-iamp burners, are tested
in this room to insure their burning the
proper amount of gas.
The electric-li^ht part of the establish
ment is in the rear of the second story
and under the charge of Mr. Green. Con
nected with it are tne roorus of nis corps
o! assistants and clerks. At the extreme
rear is a small room, handsomely fur
nished, for the use of the president when
he desires to be at leisure or indulge In
thought undisturbed.
On the third floor, over the room re
served for the uÂ»e of the board of direct
ors, is a large room extending tne whole
engthof the building. It is reserved for
use only on special occasion-. Directly
back of this apartment and to tne west
side of the structure fa the room of tne en
gineer's assistants and draughtsmen.
To the rear of it is the book.-oom, which
will be finished with cases containing
books and stationery arranged in regular
order. Next to this is tiie room occupied
by the bill c'erks of the ges department.
Adjoining it i* a small room for the use of
the.bill clerks at luncheon.
In the basement is the gas stove depart
ment. Here are kent samples of every
known appliance for heating and cooking
with eas. It is reached by steps directly
from Post street, and is under charge of a
manager who will be pleased to extend
every courtesy to those wishing to inspect
the samples.
The company attempts to make no pro
fit on these goods, but keeps them merely
to accommodate patrons and encourage
the use of tras.
The storekeeper's office is also in the
Lfwment. The storeroom has all the spe
cip.l fittings for gas and electric applances.
such as stoves, heater* and supplies.
in the rear of the basement is the meter
department, in which ah complaints, such
as leaks and stoppages, are attended to.
Near it Is the teamster's room, where an
orders are attended to by telephona. There
is room enough in the rear of the building
for a double team to turn easily.
The whole building is bented with the
Perfection asbestos grate. For very cold
weather a furnace in the basement, with
pipes leading to all the principal offices, is
brought into requisition.
One of the most marvelous features of
this new building is iis telephone system.
Ttiere are ten telephones operated by
what is known as the l\ou->e system.
Thus the president or any of liter picKs his
transmi;ter off the book, and by giving
the appropriate number, such as one or
ten, can speak with any department in
t*;e building.
Switches can be made to the local or
the Sunset telephone system at will. By
a private-systi-m of underground copper
wires any of ti.e telephones can be con
nected with the company's buildings at
North Beach and other parts of the City.
One small room is devoted to the exclu
sive use of the telephone j;irl, who ri.ids
her time well occupied in attending to
switch; s.
The officers when in a hurry can sum
mon any of their assistant* simply by
pushing the proper button of a series on
the desk.
Much credit is doe Architect Clinton
Day, under whose direction ail tne inte
rior arrangements were carried out. But
to Presiden; Crockett himself must be
Civen tuo credit for a vast deal of the ar
rangements and suKgestions for labor
saving devices. Much of his time was
spent in personal supervision.

VIGOR and VITALITY 10
The country is filled with broken-down men, men who are wrecks of physical
and mental manhood. The cause of this alarming increase in the decline of mental
and physical vigor is the abuse of nature's laws. When the abuse of the system
causes a waste of vital forces beyond nature's power to repair it there occurs a
gradual undermining of health and strength, which results inevitably in a total
breakdown if not at ended to in time. If you are afflicted with any form of weakness
or impotency resulting from errors of youth, excesses or other causes and wish to be
cured consult this great specialist without delay. His system of treatment and the
remedies he uses are new and original with him and cannot be obtained elsewhere.
The salutary effects of the treatment are noticed at once and vigor and vitality are
speedily and permanently restored to weak men.

OUE MEKOHANT MARINE.
The apeec!i of Senator Elklna on Mon
day presented the argument in favor of
discriminating duties on imports for the
purpose of aiiviiucii.g tho ship-building
industry in thi-j country in a clear, forci
ble and impressive manner. It served to
bring the issue fairly before Congret-s and
tho country and there can be little doubt
that the subject will be taken up for de
tiniiive action as soon as the tariff bill is
out of the way.
As the Senator pointed out, a country
.so Jarge as the United States, with its
8000 miles of seacoast, its numerous fine
hurbors and its immense productive ca
pacity, situated midway between Europe
and Asia and carrying on a commerce
with both, ought certainly to bo one of
the greatest, if not the very groateat,
maritime power on the clobe. It has
every inducement to build up a vast fleet
of merchant vesselt, inasmuch as its for*
eign trade is enormous and there would
bs ample worlr. for the ships in both the
Atlantic and tho Pacific oceans in carry
inc the goods which the American people
buy and sell.
Arcording to statistics quoted by Sena
tor Elkins the people of the United States
pay $500,1.00 a day to foreign ship-owners
for carrying what the American people
send abroad or bring home for their own
use. This enormous sum could be saved
to American industry by the adoption of
legislation which would promote Ameri
can ship-building and the extension of a
merchant marine owned nnd manned by
Americans, sailing under the American
Hag and extending American commerce.
The cost of constructing such ali>etnf
merchant vessels would be comparatively
little when contrasted with the enormous
expenditures we now pay for the foreign
service, and it would bo, therefore, an
economy in every sense of the word to
promote the ship-building industry.
To the argument that discriminating
duties on our part would lead other coun
tries to retaliate, the Senator set up the
answer that the only commercial rival
whom we have to feai is Great Britain,
and that she could not retaliate without
abandoning her free-trade policy and im
posing duties on American products car
ried to England in American snips. The
products we send to that country are
almost wholly the raw materials out of
which English factories make their goods,
or the food supplies on which the English
people live. A discriminating duty would
be a tax on British industry and the Brit
ish home. Such a tax is not likely to be
imposed, and the threat of retaliation
therefore is a bugaboo ol which we need
not be afraid.
The measure proposed by Senator
Elkins is one of great importance to Cali
fornia and the Pac ric Coast genera'ly.
Our ship-owners cannot at piesen-i com
pete with the subsidized ships of England
and of Japan. Some protection must be
given them; and while the proposed dis
ciiminating duties may not bo satisfactory
toull, they will cer ainly be better than
nothing. It really raatt-rs little whether
<uir merchant marine is built up by a dis
crimination in duties or by direct subsi
dies. The main thing is to promote the
construction of the ships and to eive them
an equal chance with the merchant vessels
of other nations. That is the object of the
Elkins bill, and the sooner it can be
missed the more gratifying will It be to
the people.
TEE EIVEEA fiESOLUTION.
The Senate has acted som-what slowly
in adopUng resolutions of protest against
the possible execution of Rivera, but
nevertheless it has acted in time and the
protest will undoubtedly have some effect
in preventing tho Spam-h Government
from treating the captured patriot as a
common criminal and sentencing him to
death.
The form of the resolution is such that
it can give no just cause of offense to the
Spanish authorities. It recites that
wiiereas information ha* come to the
Senate that General R vera is to be tried
by court-ma: tial and shot, therefore in the
judgment of the Senate it is th* du:y of
I tae President of the United States, if such
i information is found to be true, to Drotest
i to the Spanish Government against such a
I violation of the rules of civilized warare.
It is strange that such a resolution
should have met with any opposition at
all. The objection urced against it by
Senator Hoar, that it is founded on rumor
and hearsay, is certainly not a valia one.
The Senate must necessarily act on news
which comes to it on hearsay, inasmuch
as it is not possible foi the Senators to be
present in Cuba- and learn as actual wit
nesses what is gome on there. The fact
that the reports of the intention of Gen
eral Weyler to have Rivera shot were sent
out by reliable correspondents of the
pre^s, taken in connection with the well
known seventy of Weyler's administra
tion in Cuba, is sufficient to justify the
Senate in adopting the resolution it did.
Had the Senate waited much longer it is
possible that liivera mi^ht have been
executed before our Government would
have entered a protest or takeu any steps
to prevent it.
The adoption of the resolution is signili
cant of the interest which the American
people take in the affair- of Cub 3. The
capture of Rivera and his fate in the
hands of his Spauish captor* are bat inci
dents in the great strugcle. They are im
portant because they Have afforded the
Senate an opportunity of giving a new ex
pression of American sympathy with the
cause Of the Cuban patriots. They niav
therefore have an effect beyond that of
saving Rivera from the cruel death to
which Weyler would have sentenced him
bad he noi been preven:ed.
The resolution will carry encourage
ment to the struggling people of Cuba
and will ba a warning to the Spanish
authorities that they must not go too far.
The Government of the United States is
watching the progress of events in Cuba,
and the interference, which is now limited
to a protest, may eventually become a
recognition of the Independence of the
island and a summary warning to Spain
that the Cubans must be treated as bel
ligerents and granted all the rights of
Civilized war.
TREASURY INSTRUCTIONS.
Secretary Gage has acted promptly in
nidine Congress to carry out th- clause of
tlie Dir.gloy tariff which declares the
new rate of customs duties shall go into
effect on April 1. He cannot act under
that bill, of course, for it has not yet been
enacted into law, but he has found au
thority in an existing statute for the
adoption of a policy which will be as
effective as if the Dingiey tariff were al
ready on tbe statute-book.
The instructions of the Secretary are
that tbe customs officers shall delay until
lurther orders final liquidation of entries
of goods at our ports arriving after April
1. Payment of duties may be made ten
tatively, but samples of poods are to be
kept and tbe certificates of payment of
duties arc to be marked "Subject to change
of rates if required by law." The instruc
tions do not apply to goods arriving after
April 1 whicti were purchased and di
rected to be shipped prior to that date.
To ail other imports, however, they serve
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAT.L, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 7, ISO 7.
as a barrier and as effectually guard the
customs as if the new tariff wore already
in force.
The course taken by the House in vot
ing to put the bill into operation at a date
prior to its enactment into law is unore
cedented in our history, bnt the circum
stances o! the time justily it. Tho Gov
ernment if without :in adequate revenue
and American industry languishes by
reason of foreign competition. The
knowledge that n hichcr tariff is to be
adopted would lead to large imports of
foreign goods under the low tariff if tima
were allowed for it. Such importations
m?a!i a loss of revenue to the Nation and
a loss of work and wages to the people.
These loises must be guarded asainst,
and the action of the House in lixing the
time for the new duties to go into force
on April 1 was, therefore, in the nature of
a public necessity. The instructions is
sued by the Secretary of the Treasury
prevent harm resulting from a delay in
the passage of the bill by the Senate and
give effect to the bill as tne House desired.
THE EASTERN ELECTIONS.
The elections in Eastern cities ahow
considerable Democratic gains over
ihe vote cast in November. Tnis, of
course, was not unexpected. The tre
mendous victory of the Presidential con
test has had the usual tfL-ct of rendering
the Republicans over-sanguine while
rousing the opposition 10 make united
ana vigorous efforts to prevent further ae
feats. Such results foliow almost every
Presidential campaign, and it has become
a well-recogniied fact that what are cahed
the off years are generally years of suc
cess lor the opposition pariy.
When the returns are carefully consid
ered, however, it will bo seen that the
Democrats have little or nothing to boast
of in their apparent successes. In several
cities the Republicans were divided, and
in others tho winning party was not so
much a Democratic as a fusion ticket.
These divisions on the one side met by
combinations on the other readily ac
count for tne seeming Republican defeats
and dispel all supposition that any num
ber of voters have become dissatisfied wi.h
the ballots Wiich they cast for the Repub
lican ticket in Novemoer.
Whilfl some cnii'B have shown Democratic
gains, such State elections as were held
have been won by Republicans. In Michi
gan the Republican candidate lor Justice
of the Supreme Court has been elected
over tho fusion candidate opposed to him
and the Republican candidates for regents
of the State University were also succes-s
--ful. It la to be noted, moreover, that the
hitherto strongly Democratic city of St.
Louis has gone Republican by a ticoi
majority.
The most notable result of the elections
was the defeat of the Pmgree ticket in De
troit. Pingree has been hitherto consid
ered invincible In that city. An earnest
reiortner who had sutlicieiu business
ability and executive force to accomplish
great benefits for the peop'e, he succeeded
in being re-elected time and again against
all opposition, and when candidate for
Governor last year was elected by one of
the largest majorities ever giveu in his
State.
The defeat of the ticket which he advo
cated in Detroit has been attributed, it
seems, to the use of bribery, but it is
hardly necessary to look to that to rind a
sullicient cause for the result. There are
times when people prow weary ot inces
sant agitations even when directed toward
reform. This has probably been the
case in Detroit. Governor Pingree has
ruet the fate of men who become too
powerful and arotue opposition simply
because of their strength. The American
people object to anything that resembles
a 1, iÂ«Â«, and it is more than likely that the
Republican ticket was defeated in that
city Miut'iy because it was known as the
Pingree ticket.
Taken altogether there is nothing in the
retult of tne elections to give encourage
ment to the Democracy as a National
party or to discomfit Republican!". City
elections turn mainly on local i?sue , and
it is not at all likely that the vote of Mon
day and yesterday foreshadows in any way
the vote that will be cast by the people in
the Congressional elections of next year.

"THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL."
Letters From Our Readers on Topics of Current
Interest.
The Streets cf San Francisco.
To the Editor of the San Fravchco Callâ Sir. : We have hnd enough dearly bought lessons in
*treet paving to arouse all honest, intelligent and public-spirited officials to a keen interest in
the subject. We will be foolish if we do not heed the costly lessons of the past and protit by
them and the experience of other municipalities.
The city of Paris, France, lms won the anmtration of the world because of it* progressive
spirit and the excellence of its street management. Upon the subject Professor Albert Shaw
Miy> in "Municipal Government In Continental Europe": "Experiment* made until 1882
were disappointing. But an English company at that time offered an improved process and
agreed 10 assume hII the risks of failure. Accordingly, the company, afterward transformed
into a Franco-English company, with headquarters "at furls, obt&int-d concessions for the
paving of a number of the niost'important streets.
"Under lhl< arrangement the company agreed to construct wood2n-block pavements on a
proper cement fouuda ton and to keep them In perfect r.;pair for a terra of years, receiving in
payment an annuity of about ij 2 francs per square meter for the original cost and a further
annuity of similar average amount for keeping the pavement In good condition through the
period of tne contract."
Why should we not be the Paris of America? Wo have a more picturesque location, the
grandest harbor on the face of the earth, the finest clinmte and tne prestige of rapid growth in
population and wealth. It behooves our heavy capitalists especially to bestir themselves if
they wish to preserve the fortunes which man and nature haw showered upon them. Other
men in other cities by greater energy are likely to draw still more than they have done from
vi the trade and commerce and profit derived lrom ihe p.easure-seeklng portions of the world.
Moreover the tax upon our commercial interests anu through them upon the whole com
muniiy is so great, because of bad streets, that trade with the interior la seriously being
lessened. Bad pavements are very costly indeed. The wear and tear upon man and convey
ances of all kinds is tremendous. This expense must be added to the goods, and places ibis
community hi a disadvantage. The economy of good roads and good streets is tco well known
to admit of much comment.
Wnat are the organizations which have paraded before the public as reform bodies doing?
what are those who regularly call upon their members for monthly dues doing to esr.'i con
tinned support? And aliove all what is this community to do with the growing army of un
employed? These organizations are certainly not doing the best that can be done nor anything
in the nature of a permanent b-netit. As long as we ar* satisfied with mediocrity and tem
porary makeshifts; as long as we lay cobbles and asphaltum with the present unscientific
foundations. Sen Francisco will in this respect be behind the times and subject to all the
disadvantages and disayreettbieness which such conditions entail.
L-.'i our associations and Supervisors do the best that can be done in this matter. Let us
have the best of streets, or cease to strive for a place among the cities of our class. Let our
merchants Hnd property-owners sink into bankruptcy and pauperism, if they have not intel
ligence ana public spirit enough to take hold ol measures for the permanent public good with
cnouwh energy to successfully accomplish them.
The authority quoted above as to wnat lias boen found to be the best street pavement
(concrete foundation wood Llocks with impervious coating on top) says that the authorities of
I arls have demonstrated that better work at lower cost is done La the end by making the con
tractor accountable for his work. The reasonitbie way to accomplish tnis is, thai the work
ahull lie Kunrtiiitet-d for a number of yours ana that the stipulatea amount to be paid for ttilg
work shall be divided into equal payments, extending over the number ot years tha: such
work has been guaranted. R. L.*KYFKOGEL.

A UNION MAN ON GUARD
Supervisors Uphold the San
Franchc: Bricklayers' As
scciation.
Will Nsme a Member Who Will Su-
psrvise Hill of Justice
Fruniations.
The San Francisco Bricklayers' Associ
ation has carried its point regarding the
brick work of the Hall of Justice and a
union man to be recommended by the as
sociation and appointed by th* Board of
Supervisors wiil oversee this important
branch of the building.
Representatives of the association ap
peared before the Public Building Com
mittee of trie board to see what could be
done in the matter and stated that three
men employed on the foundations were
union men and that the others were not.
They staled that the men outside of the
union could not bo vouched for, and said
that to insure a good job a union man
should be appointed to oversee the work.
They also stated that Bateraan Bros , con
tractors left the building, had promised to
use their influence with Stiles, the sub
contractor for the brickwork, to employ
only union men.
Supervisor Britt moved that the asso
clat.on be authorized to ncme a compe
tent man to supervise the work and that
the committee recommend that the board
appoint him to the position. The motion
was carried.
Architect Shea reported thai up to Mon
day the work on the foundations had been
progressing rapidly and satisfactorily,
good men being employed, but on that
day several men had been laid eff for
some unknown reason. He also stated
that tne other sub-coniracts had not been
reported to him as they should have been.
Supervisor Britt made a motion mat
was carried that Bate-man Bros, be calied
upon to give the names of those to whom
the sut>-contracts had Deen let if they had
been let.
BUT FEW CAME TO WORK.
A Falling Off of Laborers on the Houle-
yard Yeaterdayâ Contributions Still
Cowing In.
Four hundred men answered the roll
call at ihe boulevard yesterday morning.
It i-s probable that the saower of tbfl morn
ing is responsible for the falling off in the
force. At noon, however, the number in
creased.
So far about 3000 men have applied for
work anil about 1000 of tliern have been
given employment. The total amount
spent for lator was about $3850.
Tickets for work were issued to forty
men yesterday at the Leidesdorff-street
headquarters, while 100 new names were
registered.
The men in charge of the office at L ides
dorff street complain of the unemployed
from Howard street, wno traverse Sacra
mento street in procession and act in a
boisterous manner, arou-mg the ill tem
per of those who apply there for work.
This act, the officers say, does no good
and must have a purpose other than good
when they come there in a body. Chief
Crowley will be asked to aetaii a squad of
officers to keep the marching band in sub
jection when passing the headquarters. â¢
Tie cantata "Ruth and Naomi" will be
presented at the California Theater April
21 by 110 children of the Sabbaih-school
of the Geary-street Temple for the benefit
of the fund. The children of the school
are determined to make tne affair a suc
csss. They nave resolved to stand the
extire expense of the production, so that
every cent ot tne proceeds may go toward
helping the unemployed.
Those having charge of this say it will
eclipse anything heretofore attempted in
this line.
A roast beef lunch is promised to the
men on the boulevard to-day at noon.

Interesting Reports Pre

These Shew the Condition of
the Order in California
at This Time.
Tbe First Marked Increase Sine: 1889
Grand Master Workman Will Bs
Re-e ecied-N-w Lolg:.
The annual session of the Grand Lodge
of the Ancient Oaier of United Workmen
opened yesterday morning at 10 o'clock in
B'nai B'rith Hail.
There was present ft full representation
from ihe 304 subordinate lodges of the
California jurisdiction and Grand Master
Workman Wiiliam Vinter and all the
grand officers. The Grand Lodge was
opened in due form with the grand master
workman in the chair.
The morning session was taken up with
the reading of the reports of the grand of
ficers. In the report of the grand master
workman occurs the following:
One year ago we -were depressed and anxious
as to our future, but through the dark clouds
could be iaint'y discerned a ray of lightâ the
hope th&t the Supreme Lcdze would approve
of me classified rate system.
As soon as the action ot the Supreme Lodge
was made known to me I deemed it of suffi
cient importance to reconvene the Grand
Lodge at the earliest possible inrment. On
September 1 ihe Grand Lodge reassembled and
by an almost unanimous vote adopted the
classified rate system, 'Ihe Â«iÂ«dom of their
ection is already made manifest. Since Au
gust, 1896. nearly 2700 applications have
been received. In the whole year of 1895 we
initiated 470 candidates; In January or this
year we initiated 470â as many in one month
alone as the whole year of 1895 and 79 more
than the twelve mouths of 1894. And these
results have been attained under very adverse
conditions â hard times, sharp and energetic
competition. â ._'â¢'.
He pays a tribute to John Hoesch of the
official organ, and adds "we are deeply in
debted to the papers of the State, espe
cially The Call, for their courteous and
generous aid." He also praises the wort
of Frank S. Poland, deputy grand master
workman, and bad a good word for Dr.
i Day wait, the grand mrdical examiner, and
Grand Recorder David i?. Hirshberg.
The report of tlie grand recorder is an
interesting document. In this he says:
The financial transaction? are fully set forth
In detail in the exhibits herewith, where will
be seen that the volume of business was: Ben
eficiary fund $536,961 81; general fund,
$33,441 80; relief fund. $24,136 95; ilcCabe
lund, $10 05; total, $594,550 61.
The financial statement shows:
Liabitiesâ By 310 death claims, 1896, at
52000, $620,000. Assetsâ To ca^h received,
beneficiary fund. 1896. $466,140 50: to esii
mated receipts â  :i pending calls, 1896. $400â
total, $466 540 50; deficiency, $153,495 50.
Debtorâ 77 death Claim* in the year
1896. unpaid, at $2000, $154,000. Creditâ
hv balance alter paying 233 ueath claims,
1896, $140 50; by estimated receipts, pending '
calls. 1896 *-100; by deficiency (relief granted),
$153,459 50â 5154,0J0.
In the report of the grand trustees the
following recommendations are made:
It is recommended that the expenditure of
$15,000 lor extension be under the direction
and. control ot iho Board of Corporate Direct
ors.
It is recommended that a premium of $2 50
be paid for each new member secured to the
order to the person securing same.
It was concluded to be unwise to cease ex
tension work.
The compensation of the grand medical ex
aminer is recommended 10 be $1500 per an
num, which shall be the maximum amount of
compensation, to be paid at the rate of twenty
five cents p;r medical examination, provided
! '.at the maximum amount shall not exceed
$125 lor any one mouth.
Tne compensation of the grand recorder is
divided, instead of paid in bulk as heretofore,
I and an allowance made for each employe.
During the aiternoon session a resolu
tion was offered to have biennial instead
of annual suasions on tue ground of econ
omy, but there being a doitbt as the right
to :o this, the matter was referred to the
following committee: Sol Rodgers, C. E.
Snook, Â¥. V. Wood, George IJ-ihrs and
William H. Jordan.
A resolution to discontinue the Califor
nia Workman, the official organ, was laid
over for discussion.
A resolution having for its object the
admission of non-beneficial members was
defeated.
A resolution to reduce the mileage fee
was referred to a committee.
A resolution was presented and referred.
It is that in view of tMe fact that t.ie
order has paid $34 000 for deaths by sui
cide, caused by poverty, the municipal
and State governments should proceed to
establish manufacturing and distributing
establishments for the employment of
the unemployed.
Past Grand Master C. B. Boothe of
Massachusetts, now a resident of Los An
geles, made an address after which the
lodge adjourned until this morning.
In the evening there was an exemplifi
cation of the iituali*tic work by the Pa
cific drill team of Pacific Lodge No. 7of
Oakland, assisted by Mount Hamilton
drill team of Mount Hamilton Lodge No.
43 of San Jose â and the institution of a
new lodge to be known as Perfection No.
309. The work was exceedincly well
done.
The election for grand officers will be
held to-morrow and it is possible the
â¢present grand master workman, William
j Vi.T.er, will be re-elected, as his work dur
ing the past year has been most satisfac
tory and was the subject of special com
mendation by the good of the order com
mittee during tne afternoon session. Tne
same committee also Â«poke in high term*
of the work of the grana recorder and
other grand officer?.

over $19,000 in bullion from the bottom of
the bay and landed It in sarety. Then
there were congratulations on all sides, as
nobody for a moiient thought that sne
ce;s would crown the first attempt.
When the river steamer Sunol was run
down by the Olympic and turned turtle,
her boilers, deckload and the safe in the
captain's room went to ti.e bottom of the
oay in thirteen fathoms of water. After
the steamer bad been picked up and towed
to a place of safety the wrecker Whitelaw
was put on the scene to dra? for the safe
and the bullion that went with it, in the
shape of lead bar?. In the neighborhood
of 175.000 of preciout metal went to the
bottom, and every effort was made to re
cover it. The Whitelaw recovered the
boiler and one bar of ore and a few mis
cellaneous articles, but thare was no sign
of the valuable goods.
The Piper- Aden-Goodall Company got
tired of waiting for results and General
Manager Pryor took the matter into his
own bands. All he used was a half dozen
boats from the company's fleet of schoon
ers, one tuc and tbs schooner Jessie Mat
son. In two hours the treasure was
located, bin the schooner broke away and
t:.e search had to be begun over a am
next day. Again it was located, and yes
terday the work of raising tbs sale b?can.
Diver E. H. Dolph was sent down and.
working under the most unfavorable cir
cumstance*, did one of the neatest jobs
ever done in his line.
The safe dropped Into the sand, bottom
down, and there became firmly embedded.
There were no handles on it and no place
to which the diver could affix a rope. By
digging into the sand with bis hands he
sot under one of the wheels and got a rope
under it. When he came up for a breath
ing spell almost every llu.er was bleeding
from the lacerations caused by working in
the ?and.
I> lpn went down again, and when he
pave tbe signal tho donkey engine went to
work and the safe was t&rown on its side.
Tnen he jrot a lot of wire rope and reeved
it in and ou: ot the socket of the wheel
until it was able to bear tde strain of
several tons. Then ie came up ttie side
of the schooner and gave tbe signal to
hoist away. For a moment tne suction
held the big safe, and then it came with a
rush. At the critical moment, the steam
on the donkey boner gaveout, and Messrs.
Aden and Pryor wero on tenterhooks.
Hopes were passed under tne safe and
made fa^t to the schooner so as to prevent
tne Â«Â«fe from sinking back again, but ;n a
few minutes the donkey engine liaa
generaVd so much steam, owine to
skillful nring, that she was blowine off at
tlie safety valve, and a ormple of turns ot
machinery landed the 119,000 prize on the
deck of the Georeie Woods.
The lead bullion, valued at $50,000, Is
all in a bunch and me work of recovering
it will be a simp c matter. The atver will
take down sacks with him, and as fast as
he can fill them they will be hauled
aboard. Tne work is easy and the chances
are that by to-night everything worth
saving will be on Washington-street
wharf.
Ihe Harbor Commissioners held a short
session yesterday and discussed the China
Basin question and toe lease to the San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
road. Three questions propounded so
Tirey L. Ford, the board's attorney,
elicited the information that in his
opinion the railway company had for
feited its right to ths concession in the
China Basin. He was not prepared 10
say thai the directors of the road had not
used due diligence in the prosecution of
work m the basin, and wound up by say
ine that no action was necessary on the
part of tne board at this time. "If in the
future." said Mr. *'ord, "the State desires
to retake possession then the aueitioti
would come up in better snape. "In the
meantime the rights of the Stato will in
no wise be affected by the action on the
part of the Commissioners." Tho report
was filed.
The Samaria, from Nanaimo, B. C, for
San Francisco, is behind time and mer
chants are wondering. She sailed the
same day as the Ewell and the latter has
now been in port six days, but her cap
tain reports unusually ronph weather
during the entire trip. The Ewell, how
eyer, is a very fast boat, while the Samaria
is slow.
The Ris'ion Iron Works has been or
dered to begin wort on section 3 of the
new ferry depot before the 19th inst.
This section will comprise 199 feet, and
when the iron works has completed its

He Anticipates a Great Outing on the
March From Wal!a Wa!la to

A few days since General James \V.
Forsytb, commanding the Department of
California, was advised by wire from
headquarters of the array at Washington
to make no assignment of summer duty
in tlio Yosemite National Park for Lieu
tenant-Colonel S. B. M. Younft, Fourth
Cavalry, as the department was preparing
orders for that officer. Colonel Young
was therefore expecting a cnange, but he

that Colonel Young is to succeed Captain
Atiderson, Sixth Cavalry, as superintend
ent of Yoseniite National Park. This sta
tion Is regarded as one oi the most desir
able and important on the army list.
The position is a responsible one. and
involves largely the discharge of adminis

and the admirable manner in which ho
performed his duty in thatrejrion, enlisted
the attentfon of the War and Interior
departments.
In compliance with orders. Colonel
Young must soon relinquish hi- t>osition

WHY SO MANY REGULAR PHYSICIANS FAIL
To Cure Female Illsâ Somo True Reasons Why #^^v^
Mrs. Pinkham is More Successful Than { IkL
A woman is sick : some disease peculiar to her _jfi^l-<'ffi&glLJ' '^^"K.

to her f.imily physician and tells him a
becomes agitated, forg-ets what she wants Iffl!ffB^TwfCAhp TyBSfTqJHH^
Still, we cannot blame the wo- â ^H^BpaPMEMfifiKfe'^^raÃÃ^jHw fi
years ago Mrs. Lydia E. Pink- _ .
ham, at Lynn, Mass., determined to step in and help her sex. Having had consid-
erable experience in treating female ills with her Vegetable Compound, she en-
couraged the women of America to write to her for advice in regard to their
complaints, and, being a woman, it was easy for her ailing sisters to pour into
: her ears every detail of their suffering. , "
In this way she was able to do for them what the physicians were unable
to do, simply because she had the proper information to work upon, and
from the little group of women who sought her . advice years ago a great
army of her fellow-beings are to-day constantly applying for advice and re-
lief, and the fact that more than one hundred thousand of them have been
successfully treated by Mrs. Pinkham during the last year is indicative of
the grand results which are produced by her unequaled experience and
training. â.; ..
No physician in the world has had such a training, or has such an amount
of information at hand to assist in the -treatment of all kinds of female ills,
from the simplest local irritation to the most complicated diseases of the womb.'
This, therefore, is the reason why Mrs. Pinkham, in her laboratory at
Lynn, Mass., is able to do more for the ailing women of America than the
family physician. Any woman, therefore, is responsible for her own suffering
who will not take the trouble to write to Mrs. Piskham for advice.
The testimonials which we are constantly publishing from grateful women
jstablish beyond a doubt the .power of Lydia E. Pinkhams Vegetable Con>
pound to conquer: female diseases. _ . , ..
try, hence he anticipates a finÂ© outing on
tne leisurely ride irom Walla Walla to
Fort Yellowstone.
Captain Stevens knows all about the
routine of duty on the Yellowstone reser
vation as he was gtationed there for a long
time. He speaks highly of t; c hotels, the
completeness of their equipment, and says
that daring summer iuontna the park "is
visited by di-<tiu<;aished tourist* irom all
quarters of tne globe. Tne roads are good
nnd the bridges superior, but much re
mains in the way of road extension.
The Government makes ample annual
allowance for the maintenance of the
park. The transportation companies run
ning the stauo lines on the reservation
aii't the parties conductine the hotels are
required by the superintendent to serve
the public in a proper manner. The park,
owing to its accessibility by rail, is a great
resort for newly wedded pairs. Cabinet
officers. Senators, eminent jurists, diplo
mats and wealthy travelers seek the solace
of the great reservation in the summer
season.
It is thought by army people that the
Yosemite National Par* miplu be:n.de to
the Pacific Coast what the Yellowstone is
to the East if our public-spirited citizens
and transportation companies should
spend some money to make it accessible
and ihe State appropriate means to main
tain tiret-class hotels in the valley. The
Yellowstone, with all its gorgeous color
ing and natural beuuiies. cannot equa:
the wonders and fascination of the Yo
seroite.
Colonel Young expects that the oriers
from Wasbinstun will reach the Presidio
next week. He may be able to leave for
Will a Walla by the 16th inst-

His Match With Green Declared Off In
Consequence.
The superintendent of the Olympic
Club, William J. Kennedy, received a dis
patch from Tommy Rj-an of Syracuse,
N. V., j"esterday, which stated that Rran
will not meet Green in this City unless the
Olympic Club will give a $5000 purse and
aiiow $.500 for the expenses of the welter
weight, to the coss'. Ryan also stipulates
thai Siler must be the referee and thai be
be allowed $1000 and his expenses to and
from the coast.
Kennedy answered the message and
said in brief: "Match off; you've got cold
feet."
Leader Howard Taylor states that the
club will ?eccre first-class talent and a
show will be given in the first week in

AN EYE FOR A

J. E. McFadden Will De
mand It of Consul
Pringle.
A Story of How Americans Are
Abused in President Barrios'
Realm.
United States Minister Cox in Guate
mala Informs This Government
of Another Cruel Outrage.
"Do you know Consul Pringle, who rep
resents the United States in Guatemala?
I am going to pull his eye out as soon as
bis term of office is finished, when he
J. E. McFADDEN, "Who "Was Imprisoned in Guatemala, and Who j
Makes Serious Charges Against United States Consul
Pringle in Earrios* Realm.
pasnes through this City on his way to
"Washington."
This startling announcement was made
yesterday at the Palace Hotel, by J. E.
bklcFadaen, who arrived here on the
steamer Colon on March 30, from Guate
mala.
McF adden is an old-tame residen t of this
State, and as a trusted employe he has for
years been in charge of the swell stations
on the cocstail route.
It is he who mixed the Santa Cruz rum
punch that Patti drank in Ernest
Hacquette's art gallery twelve years ago,
and who subsequently was foolish enough
to heed the advice of Eddie Morphey
calling him to Japan to concoct mint
juleps for the Mikado. That venture was
unsatisfactory to an extreme, as the de
capitation of his body was threatened at
one time, because somo high dignitary
dallied too long with ths captious South
ern drink.
McFadden left here for the realm of
Rena Barrios on February 8 of this year,
to take charge of ttie American Club,
which occupies the President's old man
sion opposite the Grand Opera-house in
Guatemala. He arrived in that country
February 1:6 and took Up quarters in the
new Grand Central Hotel, which Presi
dent .Barrios has erected at las own ex
pense to accommodate the expected visit
ors to the Guatemalan exposition.
"sow that I have '.worn to my state
ments and they have become official docu
ments. I do not mini! bpeaJcinv o; them
for publication," said Mr. McFaduen.
"I have sworn to allidavits before
United States Minister Cox at Guatemala,
and he has forwarded them to Washing
ton, accompanied by his own. relating to
the outrageous treatment inflicted upon
me in Guatemala by President Barrios
and his minions.
"I had been in Guatemala but a couple
of week?, and it was well known that I
had considerable monej' on my person. I
met the lively and best set in the place,
and, whi.e it is contrary to the law to
gamble, 1 did so to the extent of shaking
dice on several occasions ior money, just
as the Chief of Police and even President
Barrios does hi his own house or at the
club.
"Among the men I met through the
American colony and othÂ»-r good people
in the country was the chief engiueerof
the penitentiary. We and otherj st.nok
dice in a private residence and I won
some trifle. The next night I was pulled
out of my bed by some soldiers a:irt
brought to a dungeon in the prison. I
remained there thirty-six hours until I
was given a trial and acquitted of any in
tent to violate the Jaws 01 the country.
''Wtiile in jail in a fetid veimi'i inhabit
ed cell I was permitted to send out ruet
pengers to United Mates Minister Cox and
United Slates Consul Prinze- Tho former
is a new appointee in tlse place of the late
General Young, and being not only new
in the country, but a very young man, he
â¢was at a loss to know how to act. Consul
Fringle, however, failed absolutely to pay
uny attention to m.> case, and when after
my acquittal by the native police fudge I
went to him for redress he blandly a^ked
me: 'How much money have you pot ?'
"Think of it; the incarceration in a vile
dungeon and tne taking away irom me of
all my property was not sufficient for this
representative of the United States Gov
ernment to iook into the matter without
his knowing how much money 1 had.
"I told him that every dollar I dad was
taken Irom me at iho tinio of my arrest.
lth.cn had $2140 in paper rnonev ntiu sil
ver and $110 In gold. All I asked Prlngla
to do was to gei me my money, and I
would be only too happy to go back
home.
"Minister Cox gave me all the sympathy
he could, but declared himself powerless
to act in the matter, excepting to make an
olficial report to the home Government in
regard to the case, which has been done.
"When I was liberated from my thirty
six hours in jail and acquitted of all
criminality I spent six days about the
police station trying to recover my money
and my gold watch and chain that had
been taken from me.
"Minister Cox, who is now in Guate
mala, and unaware of the ropes, referred
me to this man Pringle to attend to my
case. Frinele simply sat back and told
me he would uot act unless he saw his fee
in advance.
"While I was in the penitentiary for a
day and a half I had an experience that
nsig&t be amusing to one with a strong
degree of humor. I hRd been stripped of
all my valuables, excepting a tiny gold
band "on this finger. I have worn it for
years, and unlesÂ« it was cut off it could
not ha removed. I was anxious to get a
message out of the Jail to the Consul or
Minister and begged my jaiier to convey
it. Tne fellow wanted pay, which I was
unable to eive him. He saw my gold rinc
and demanded that I Rive it to him.
'Take it off,' I said, langhinglv, proffering
my hand and smilinc. As I opened my
mouth the jailer noticed my teeth filled
with gold, and he pointed to them, un
mistakably indicating that he wanted
them too."
Mr. McFadden relates how he became
thorough!}' dishe;irtene.l with Consul
Pringle's efforts to recover his properly,
and giving up all hope he was on his way
to tne consulate to tell Pringle how he
le!t, when he was encountered r.y a police
man who handea him $110 in gold, a por
uon of t:ie money ho had on nis person
when arrested, and intimated it would be
a safe thing to leave town on the next
train.
"1 went to Minister Cox and informed
him of what had happened. He was
greatly put out, but advised me to wait
until h'* heard from Washington. I told
him I could not do so, as I was virtually
penniless. Consul Pringle told me that
tlie best thing for rue to do was to 'get
out' and to trtKe chances on his recover
ing my money and jawelry by 'diplo
matic correspondence.'
"When Consul Pnncle reaches this
City in a few months I will have much
pleasure in rehearsing this affair with
him and incidentally pulling out one of
his eyes.
"As to my hopes of recovering my prop
erly, I have buried them.' 1
THE ARMY COLONY CLUB
Interesting Meeting of the Fam
ilies of the Colo
nists.
Itemized Cost of the Little Ranches
and How They May be Paid
For.
The first meeting of the Salvation Army
Colonization Club was held last evening
at the Institute on New Mont. ornery
street. The club is composed of the 200
men who have registered as beinz dcs r
ous of acquiring a little homestead on the
colony plan.
The hall at the Salvation Array Insti
tute was tilled last evening by the families
of those who have registered. The plan
of thf colony and by what magic the
members were to come into possession of
a farm and a house irlti out money was
explained by Major William A. Mc
lruyre. Major Wincliell bfiinir incapaci
tated by c. cold. Ma jor Mclntyre said that
every one ol the little ranches would be
supplied with a cow and fifty chickens.
Tne product of these, above the con
snmption of the family, would be turned
into a general depot under tho manage
ment of the ar:ay or the colony, and a
market found for it. It was .estimated
that this surplus would pay for all the
other necessities of the family â in otner
words that the cow and chickens would
support the family, leaving the product
of the land to go toward paying for the
ranch.
It wan estimated further, that thÂ«> cul
tivation of t!ie land would realize $75 per
acre ncr venr, so that it would soon clear
off the debt, leaving the colonist an owner
in fee. The cost of the ranch, with im
provements, stock, etc., waÃ given as fol
lows:
Lard five acres, at $50 per acre, $250; house,
$50; windmill, $50; barn aud chicken yard,
.^SO; siock. one cow, fifty chickens, .^SO; inci
dentals, taxes, etc., .fSO; total, $500.
George H.Maxwell of the Chamber of
Commerce committee made a short and
practical address. He said this whole
matter depended for its success upon
nothing so much as education in the
business of getting product out of tne
earth.
A stereopiicon show of California farms
followed, with ruusic. Great interest was
manifested.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 7, 1897.
THERE WILL BE
TWO BRIDGES
No Agreement Possible for
Building a Joint
Structure.
Conferences Between the South
ern Pacific and Supervisors
Futile.
General M nrger Kruttschnitt Decides
That "Loop" Trains Are
Inexpedient.
It can now be stated on the authority of
a Southern Pacific official that there will
continue to be two bridges across OaKland
Creek.
When the Treasui y Department ordered
that the spans of the bridges now crossing
Oakland Creek at Alice street and Web
ster street be increased from 90 fen to 150,
the Southern Pacific Company at once
prepared plans and specifications for a
new bridge across Ahce street, over
which they proposed to run both their
bioad and narrow gauge trains. These
were forwarded to Washington and in due
time approved. If this plan of using one
br.dge lor all the trains were carried out
by ihe Southern Pacific Company it would
leave the bridge for vehicles, streetcars
and pedestrians to be built by the county
of Alameda. '
Realizing this fact the Supervisors of
that county asked for a conference with
the railroad people for the puriose of dis
cussing a plan for a single joint bridge,
the cost of construction and maintenance
to be shared between the county and the
railroad company. Among the proposi
tions discussed was a doutile-deck bridge,
one floor to be used for trains and the
oiher for ordinary tralftc ; another scheme
was to construct an unusually wide affair
tnat wouid afford ample room lor double
railroad tracks, lor isireetcar tracks, tora
wagon road and lor a wa!k. Several con
ferences were had, but the views ol the
iwo parties were so far apart tha: no
agreement was posaiDle.
The railroad people have finally come
to tne conclusion that it will oe useless 10
continue any lurther negotiations with
the Alameda County Supervisors unde
tne circumstances. They say tfsat evei
at the best the construction ol a join
bridge would be of little be.ieti; to an>
one, and would, in all probability, only
prove a subject of future contentions.
The exten&ion granttd by the Wash
ington author. t:es Â«-xpires in'Juiy at 1898
and it is the desire of the railroad com
l>any to begin work in ample time to com
pieie it wit u in the specified time.
There l.aye been several suggestion
made by residents across the bay lo
obviating tha necessity of any railroad
bridge across the cs vary. These involve
the runninz oi "loop" trains from both
the broad and narrow gauge moles, bo as
to make the circuit around Oakland Creek
via Fruitvale from one mo;e to the other.
General Manager Kruttschnitt, when me
matter wma called to his attention, said
the idea had occurred to him, but was
cast aside, as n won d seriously incon
venience the large number of passengers
who now use the narrow gauge in eoing
to O.iKland from this side and thos? who
use the broad gauge in going to Alurcedu.
This class of passengers is now carried
direct by way of the bridges across Oak
hind Creek. Under the loop system the
Oakland people would either have io wait
for the broad-gauge trains and ferr es or
viouid have to be carried around Fruitvale
and be at least fifteen minutes longer on
their journey than at present, while the |
Alameda reMdents would have t<TConnne
their patronage to the narrow-^auge car
riers or swing three-quarters Broutid a
circle instead of a quarter or a third as
now.
It is, under the circumstances, the pur
pose of the Southern Pacific Company to
buiid a new br.dge of its own designing
and for its *o!e use across Oakland Creefe
at Alice street and to continue to operate
its trains and ferries as at prevent.

of an age of careful experiment, and is pretty generally agreed upon now by all educated
physicians who keep up with the time*. The discovery of the past few years of the means
of reducing every drug to a pbwder and compressing the powders into little lo,2n^Â«^.Â«l^
lets, or tabule. if you prefer, which will not break or spoil, or lose their giod fquafftie, from
age, is the explanation of how it has come about that this prescription is nolv^or sale as an
advertised r medy. It is the medicine that nine people out of ten need every time Sev need
any and I have no douht that making it so easy to obtain, so carefully pxÂ«Sreâ¢ and vrhlSd
so cheap, will tend tÂ» prolong the average of human life during the present generadon""
come to San Francisco scon and organize
tho Master Horseshoers' Association.
Such an organization of the Dosses is
highly commended by the journeymen as
tne two bodies always work together in
the interests of the trade and of unionism.
RELIGION AND TRADE.
The Attendance at the Chamber of
lonimsrce Service Doubted.
There was a largely increased attendance
at the lenten service in the Chamber of
Commerce yesterday at noon.
The services were opened by George E.
Bennett of the Brotherhood of St. An
drew, and Archdeacon Percy C. Webber of
Boston made an address, taking for his
text the First Commandment, "Tnou
Shait Have no Other Gods bnt Me."
The organ was presided over by J. E.
Bigtlow of St. Peters. The services are
attracting very favorable attention among
the business men.
RHEUMATISM.
Munyon's Rheumatism Care is guaran-
teed to cure atfute or muscular rheuma-
tism in Jrora one to five days. Sharp,
shooting pains in any part of the body
stopped by a few doÂ«es. A prompt, com-
plete and permanent cure for lameness,
soreness, stiff bacfc and all pains in hips
and Joins. Chronic rheumatism, sciatica,
lumbago or pain in the back are speedily
cured. It seldom fails to give relief from
one or two doses, and almost invariably
rnres before one bottle has been used.
Price. 25c.
Improved Homoeopathic Home Remedy

disease. At all druggists, mostly 25 cents.

IN RIDING FORM
Piloted Four Out of Six
Winners Past the
Wire.
A Ragged Lcoking Card At
tracted a Light Crowd to
Emeryville.
Midas Won in a Drive From La
M;scottaâ B.'rnardillo Was a
"Gjod Thing."
Outside of the achievements of K.
Martin in the way of saddle-work, the
racing at Emeryville yesterday was dull ,
and uninteresting. "Sheets," as he is !
familiarly called by racegoers, piloted no
Jess than four ot the six winners past the
wire, and, if he will abstain from "small
bots" and attendant luxuries the coming
summer in the East, will press the only
Tod for the jockey championship. The I
card was very cheap, and in consequence j
the betting was very light. Favorites cap
tured two races.
In the opening; race, fifteen maiden two- !
year-olds faced the barrier. Melvin Burn- j
ham, a 5 to 1 snot, wod cleverly at the j
end from Allie Belle, a tilly by imp. j
Pirate of Penzance, owned by W. L. Stan- i
Held. Andrea, the favoiite, was unplaced, j
The six-furlong event that followed was ;
gathered in by Midas, against which 'i to :
1 was laid. Ridden by B>b Isom he won j
driving, a bead before La Maecotta, tue j
second choice. Bueno, the favorite, was j
unplaced.
Barney Schreiber's Greyhurst carried j
the coin of the talent in the mile run that ;
was third on the card, poing to the post a j
warm 7to 10 favorite. He displayed poor j
form, ing easily beaten out by the sto j
1 shot, Bernardillo, sent over the wires to !
the Eastern country as a "good thing." â 
St. Distr.ff was just an ordinary third.
Rosormonde fortuna:elv drew a good
position in the second two-year-old scram
ble and with much doing at 2 1 to 1 led ,
her field of sixteen out very cuteiy. Front
de Boeuf ran a good race finishing second, j
five lengths in front of Sam Durango.
The tilth event on the card was a seven- J
furlong selling affair. Perseus opened at j
a 7 to 5 choice, receding later to 9 to 5. i
After acting very badly at the post the j
second choice, Alvarado, got away flying
and won in a common canter. Cabrillo, !
the third choice, was second, six lengths
ahead of Kowaisky, against which (30 to 1 ',
was laid.
The final race of the day was tafceu in a j
hard drive by Altanera, the 13 to 5 favor
ite. "Skeeis" Martin had the mount on
the Baldwin filly and at the ena. outriding
Lena, carried the verdict by a neck. [

Perseus is owned by Ed Purser and as Mr.
Purser has laid away no big: amount of
money this winter it is more than prob
able his horse would have won yesterday
if it were possible. Judge Murphy, in
quoting the ruliri? of the judges, said:
"It was not this particular case, but on
ott.er occasions Murry's horses had run ;
peculiar." Then why were these ques- \
tionable runs not investigated at the
time? They should have been proved
then and there and not held- over. Mr.
Murphy once wrote a very tangible story ;
of how'the mare Lizzie H could be guided
by a silken thread, so sensitive was she to |
the touch, out if the honorable judge ,
could have beard the betting instructions I
given a certain Ruby bookmaker perhaps j
De himself would have been touched.

WHAT IT COST
FAIR TO DIE
fudge Slack Hears Evi
dence on Dr. Mizner's
Biil
Five Thousand Dollars Asked
for Three Days' Ser
vices.
Prcf'ssor Siicld Says the Charge
Shou d Depend on the Patien'.'s
Exch quer.
Judge Slack devoted considerable time |
yesterday to hearing evidence concerning j
the value of doctors' services in the Fair |
ca^e. The question arose in the claim of >
Dr. William B. .Mizner for $5000, and some \
interesting matters were deve. oped during '
the examination.
Attorney Robert B. Mitchell was much
perturbed, in spite of the great fes law- \
yers charge rich men, that Dr. Mizner
should nave charge*! about $lOJ6 a day for
attending a multi-millionaire during his
last illness, lie was uoi set quite right on !
trie proposition until Dr. George Shields,
professor of surgery in the State Univer
sity, elucidated the question and scored a
few strong points as to the value of pro- ;
fessional services in cases involving rich
men's lives. Dr. Shields incidentally save j
everybody to understand thai there is a j
kinship between the skillful, fee-charging :
doctor and the expert, fee-chaiging law
yer. â¢ : ; j;t; ; %
Dr. Mizner made a good witness in a
way, though not a shrewd, self-laudatory :
one. â¢â¢ 'â :â â ;,â . :â¢;?â â¢â¢ "â 
He swore that he wai Dr. Marc Leving- !
stbn's assistant during the last four days j
of the late James G. Fair's life. Dr. i
Ko-enstirn and Dr. Tail were also in the {
case, and each of them has put in a bill
for $5000.
"Charles Fair was ranch interested in
the post mortem which I performed." j
said Dr. Mizner, "and he said questions
of sanity might arise and he wanted the
greatest care taken in every detail; so 1
took tjreat care in the autopsy and in em
balming the body. i Herman Ocirichs was
present during part of the proceedings, ]
and he took great interest in all we did. J
"I consider that my services in the â¢
autopsy were.worth $1500 and the embalm- j
ing was worth the same. 1 base the claim
on the importance of the case and the ex- !
treme care I took, rather than on the I
wealth of the man. My bill in all for the I
three days is $3000. and I consider it a
legitimate charge."
The itemized bill showing in detail Dr.
Miznrr's idea of what his services were
worth runs about as follows, though (he
bill was itemized verbally on cross-exami- ;
nation:
Hy pddormeÂ»ig, three days $250 I

Analytical examination!!..: ......" .00
Microscopic examination*. 4IÂ»U
Autopsy â  1,. 00
Embalming... .' 1,500 |
Total Â«4,650 j
"That leaves you a few hundred dollars j
shy on your $5000 account, does it not?" \
asked Attorney Mitchell.
Judge Slackâ Are you familiar with the
word "â¢by" in the <-en-e meant by the 1
learned [Laughter.]
"Yes, Mr: and 1 mane up the uifference
in a gene-al way. I did not mean tj
itemiz- ;ne bill."
Dr. M z'ipr said he was called into the
case by Dr. L?vir.g3ton, but ;uat the late
Senator said to him: "Look out for me
and tp.ke gocd care of me," so the doctor
returned.
Dr. Levingston affirmed that the charge
was very reasonable. He said Dr. Mizner
did the principal work in ;he autopsy.
"What \v:ic it worth?"
"Oh. say $1000."
"Didn't you hear Dr. Mizner say $l">00?"
"No, I'm der\f iti one ear, but if ne said
it i- woith $1500 it is wonh ii." [Laugii
ter/
L'r. L?vin?Dton then told how he had
often charged the late Senator fc<o a visit,
and (be re was no complaint, "He once
paid me $'200 to look after a friend a few
days."
The evidence of Dr. George Shields was
very concise. He said :
"A doctor can't put a foot rule on a
cÂ»se as a haberdasher >e!!s buttons. Dr.
M. z n i-r's charges are cxrerueiy moderate."
â¢â¢Wiiy? '
''Because of the importance of the man
who d ed, the value of his lite and the
â¼a!ue of the physician. A 'lector who per
forms an autopsy takes his Jiff in his
hand-. It is a more uelicate thing than a
Bkilltul vjrjrical operation. This was a pe
culiar case, anil I think the post niortsm
was worth f.SOOO. Doctors are watched
with great criticism in such cases, and
they ought t.j charge well."
"cio you th:nk it wa< worth more than
in an ordinary eiiÂ«e? " askert Mitchell?
'"Assuredly, and for the same reason
that lawyers charge according to the
wealth of tno man in the case."
A further hearing of the case goes on at
1:30 P. m. on Monday.
KEEGAN WAS TRUSTFUL
lie Accuses John Kelly of Getting a
Uce'l by Fraud and Deceit.
Michael Kee^an has sued his cousin
John H. KÂ°ily for the recovery of valuable |
real estate, which he avers was obtained |
from him by artifice and fraud. I
The plaintiff says that on Ihe 30th of last
October Kelly induced h m to execute a
paper which purported to be a deed of
gift, whereby trie pla miff conveyed to the '
defendant a lot of land on Minna street,'
near Seventh, together with the improve- ;
ments thereon; that this alleged convey- i
ance purported to be for love and affection, ;
but thai in fact therÂ»> was no considera- i
tion; that the plaintiff is old and feeble !
and Infirm in mind and body, and that
the defendant used his influence to deceive :
and defraud the plaintiff, the result being
that the deed was signed as here men
tioned.
Keegan declares that having confidence |
in Krlly he executed the conveyance, but !
since has learned his mistake and wants !
nis property back. In last January Kelly ,
mortgaged "the property to the Hibernia
Savings and Loan Society for $3000 and is
now spending the proceeds. A portion of
the money Is in the Anglo-California Bank. '
For this reason Keegan asks for the ap- j
pointment of a receiver to take charge of |
the money for his benefit. He also asks â 
that the pretended deed of gift be set aside, j
and tnnt he be nil in possession of his real '
estate on Minna street. i
Got an Old T.cket.
Robert Goldstone, 20 years of age, wai ar

ceny. The complaiuing witness is Mrs. Mary
Hurley, who Â»i ece 1 - thÂ«t on Fehruary 28 she
gave Uoldatine to bet ou a horse. Gold
stone gave her a ticket which she subse
quently discovered was an old one.

Old-Fashioned Knockers Again.
There ha^ been in recent years, along
with an increasing use of the colonial
style in architecture, a mild revival oi
the old-fashioned door-knocker. And
nowadays one may see occasionally a
knocker on the halldoor of an
apartment In an apartment-house in
this city. A visitor who steps out of an
elevator and proceeds along a hall to see,
when he Tenches the apartment he seeks, a
Knocker upon the door, may be a little sur
prised at it at first, but only for a moment;
for, despite its modern surroundings, the
door-knocker stands here, as it does every
where to one who has been accustomed to
seeing it, as the symbol of home.
In at least one instance the door-lcnocker
in use on the hall door of an apartment in
this city was brought from an ancestral
house in New England. In one apartment
house in New York door-knockers appear
upon the hall doors of five apart men tx.and
they are all of different styles. It has been
found that friends who come to doors that
have door- knockers upon them are likely to
knock, while straneers and those why
come on business errands are more likeio
to use the modern electric ball. â New York

Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, April. 6. )
P. E. Borem, the well-known politician.
who was recently sued for divorce by his
wife, has packed his trunk and disap
peared, and the wife is not able to procure
any alimony. He went just after obtain
in-; a mortgage on their home at Eleventh
and Alice streets.
The Boreins have been married many
years and have a grown-un family. Many
years aj*o Borein was a county official and
served several terms. For many years
PETER BOREIN, Whose Wife Wants Alimony But Cannot
Find Him.
they have lived at Eleventh and Alice
streets, and t!;eir family relations have
Leen [ eculiarly free from discord. Re
cently, however, according to the com
plain*, fil-cl by Mrs. Borein, her husband
has been practicing numerous bad habits,
not the letst of which is indulging a taste
for liquor and neglecting his home.
A few days ago Mrs. Borein applied to
the court for temporary alimony. A
notice of the motion was served on Borein
and was to hava been heard this morning,
bnt Borein cannot be found. It was
stated that he had crossed the State line,
had taken bis trunk with him and that be
would probably not return, either to listen
to the alimony proceedings or to fight the
divorce case. Before going out of the
State Mr. Borein secured a niortcage upon
the homestead. His stepfather when he
heard of the difficulty offered to release
the mortgage ne held on tha property
provided they would get a loin upon it
for fifjOO. They were to pay $500 to a
party in this city and send him the bal
ance to hold for their joint benefit. !
Bore:n negotiated the loan, paid the $500 !
and sent $1750 to the feteifather. 'i'ne :
balance he Kept for himself. wi:h the ex- j
ceptionofa paltry $125, whicn. he gener
oasly sent to his wife.
After the divorce was filed Borein !
offered to quit all bis bad habits and i
square up aii hiÂ« debts if his wife would 1
consent to the mortgage on the home- j
stead. She consented and the money was
raised. But she benefited very little. The
parties have been married twenty-two !
years, and it was a great surprise to local
society when the secrets of the Borein
home were made public in the complaint
for divorce.
The attorneys believe that he paid all
his debts, squared up his business and left
for Illinois, where his stepfather lives.
Nothing has been -een or heard of him
for a week. Mrs. Borein never spoke to
him after the suit was filed and was very
much surprised at his abrupt departure.
Her stepfather always seemed deeply in- j
wrested in her weitare and in all of his I
letters he planned for her individual good. I
If Borein has gone to his stepfather he |
will get no more than his share of the j
money rajsed on the homestead unless
Mrs. Borein has been very much deceived
in his character, and thi9 she declares she
has not.
The divorce will be prosecuted and the
money will be declared community prop
erty, and by this moans Mrs. Borein hopes
to obtain her lejjal share.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 7, 1897.
A COLORED MAN
REFUSED RIGHTS
Entered a Barber's Shop
and Left Without
a Shave.
Will Bring a Suit for Civil
Damages and Test the
â¢ Bill Just Passed.
â â â â â â
William Pott's Friends Subscribed a
Purse and Will Carry the Test
Case to the Supreme Court. '
Oakland Office San Fbancifco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 6. )
An incident of interest to the whole
State transpired recently which will cause
a test of the constitutionality of the race
bill passed by the iast Legislature.
William Pctt, a colored man, living in
this city, went into a barber-shop for the
purpose of being shaved. The establish
ment is conducted by white barbers and
patronized exclusively by that race. Pott
waa looked upon as a curiosity, and afier
he took off his coat and collar he walked
toward one of the chairs and was per
mitted to seat himself. As soon as he
said that lie wanted a shave he was in
formed that he could not be accommo
dated, l'oit had anticipated tnis, and he
informed the proprietor that under the
new civil rights bill he would have an ac
tion for damages. But the barber said he
would take chances, and declined the
work.
After leaving the barbsr - shop Pott
hunted up an attorney and expressed his
intention of at once commencing an
action for damages. As the bill had not
been sent out in the statutes for 1897 ap
plication was made to Sacramento for a
certified copy. It arrived this morning
from Secretary of State Brown and con
tains the following paragraph:
That all citizens within the jurisdiction of
this State shall be entitled to the full and
equal accommodations, advantages, facilities
ami privileges of Inns, restaurants, hotels,
eating - houses, barber - shops, bathhouses,
theaters, skating rinks, and all other places of
public accommodation or amusement, subject
only to the conditions and limitations estab
lished by law and applicable alike* to all citi
zens.
Suit will be commenced at once and
both colored and white people ah over the
State will be ereatly interested in the re
sult. Pott's friends in this city have de
cided to put up a purse and carry the case
to the Supreme Court if they are defeated
in the lower tribunal.
White proprietors of places mentioned in
the act are also interested in the result, for
they declare that it will be impossible to
enfore the law, even if it be held to be
valid. On former occasions some trouble
has resulted when while folks have been
expected to sit at table with colored peo
ple, and Cue hotel proprietors are anxious
to beat the law.
Muny attorneys have expressed opinions
on the matter. T. F. Garrity will fight
the rase on beha!f of the colored Emits.
On the other hand ex-Judge Nusbaumer
says he believes the bill to be unconstitu
tional as regards barber-shops. He say?
he does not see how one man can compel
another to render personal service against
his will.
In tne Judicial Committee of the House
and Senate this question was thoroughly
discussed before the bill was recommended
lor passage, and it was decided by both
those bo.iies that the bill would "stand.
The outcome, therefore, would be of equal
interest to attorneys and others.
EXPECTORATED IN A CAR.
W. B. Bradbury, Capitalist and
Millionaire, tbe Of
fender.
Against the Warnings of the Con
ductor He P.rsisted in Violat
ing tbe Ordinance.
W. B. Bradbury, the well-known capi
talist and millionaire living at KSOO Van
Ntss avenue, has the honor of being the
first victim of the ordinance recently
passed by the Board of Supervisors mak
ine it a misdemeanor for any one to ex
pectorate on the floors of streetcars and
public buildings or on the sidewalks.
The alleged offense was committed on
the evening of March 26, in csr 50G of the
Sacramento-street line, of which H. J.
Huth, who is the complaining witness,
was the conductor.
According to the conductor's statement
the car left the ferry on March 20 at 7:27
p. m. Between Drumm and Davis streets
Huth observed Bradbury expectorating on
the floor of the car, and he politely drew
his attention to the notice posted up in
the car, and requested him not to use the
floor as a cuspidor.
"How dare you speak to mcl" said
Bradbury. "I'll spit just where i have a
mind to."
Huth went out to the dummy to collect
some fares and told tiie ennman what
Bradbury had done, and as he again en
tered the car Bradbury expectorated on
the lloor.
Huth again remonstrated with him, and
Bradbury said: "1 don't care what you
say. 1 have raid ruy fare, and you can
teii E P. Vining that I'll bpit on the floor
of ti is cars when I wish to.''
"How would you leel if I were to spit
on your carpet?' asked Huth.
"This isn't a carpet," replied Bradbury.
â¢'No," retorted Huth, "but 1 have to keep
it clean, and I don't want you to spit ou
it."
Bradbury asked for the conductor's
name and told him be would make it hot
for him. He tantal:z n d the conductor by
continuing to expectorate on the floor,
and when he left the cnrat Van Ness ave
nue he expectorated on the platform b>
fore stepping off.
Hulh dent in a report of the case to the
superintendent, detailing the facts as re
lated, and Attorney Kelly was instructed
to take action against me cupitalist.
Yesterday morning Conductor Huth
appeared befoe Judge Low, accompar.iÂ«d
by Attorney Kelly, and swore 10 the com
plaint charging Bradbury with violating
the ordinance, and a warrant was issued
for his arrest.
There were three Indies in the rar at the
time, and one of them, Mr*. Jenkins, 2100
Mason street, told the conductor that she
would willingly appear as a witness.
Bradbury had not been arrested up 10 a
late hour ias: night. He was seen at bii
residence, and when told that the warrant
was out for bis arrest for expectorating in
a cable-car he was very much gnrprlsed.
"I have no recollections oi the matter,"
said he. "I am in the habit of always
chewing a wooden toothpick and uncon
sciously expectorate while doing so, and it
is possiple I may have done so in the car."
When told of the alleged conversation
between him and the conductor he said:
"They are all false. Nothing of the
kind ever took place between me and any
conductor, and I don't think I could have
been in the car on the night in question.
"I go to rieasanton every JMondav to
look after some horses I have there and
return the following night. These are the
only occasions lam out at night. I will
have to think whether I could have been
there that night or not. At present I am
inclined to believe that the conductor is
mistaken.
"1 did not know that such an ordinance
was in existence and I think it is ridicu
lous. My attorney will defend me, ana I
think I will test the constitutionality of
the ordinance. I will surrender myself to
morrow morning now thfct l know tne
warrant is out for my arrest, and then I
will see my attorney,"

FARMER AYLWARD
TELLS HIS STORY
A Year Ago He Owned an
Old Water Plant, but
Now He Does Not.
How the Livermore Water and
Power Company Came to
Bs Organized.
W. J D.nge? Thought Livsrmore an
Ideal Place for a Safe In
vestment.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call )
108 Broadway, April 6. )
Johu Aylward, the Livermore farmer,
who owned n water works a year ago, has
almost finished telling the court how it
came about that he is no longer proprietor
of the plant at Livermore.
The suit on trial was brought by Ayl
ward against the Livermore Water and
Power Company to prevent an assessment
on his ptock and to compel the defendants
to fulfill their contract.
A year ago Jim Stanley, the Mission
San Jose politician, gave Mr. Aylward an
introduction to W. J. Dingee, and the
conversation turned upon the advisability
of making Mr. Aylward's water plant a
profitable concern. A little later, accord
ing to Aylward's story, Mr. Dingee's
man, Ed Vincent; \\\ F. Boardman, his
engineer, and Jim Stanley went to Liver
more and surveyed the property.
They were very favorably impressed
with it, and when they saw the tine aup
ply of water, the riparian rights of which
were owned by Aylward, they reported
very favorably to Dingee. One week later
Mr. Dingee made a trip to Liverraore to
see for hini'self what Ayiwaid possessed.
Aylward placed a line carriage at the
disposal of the party and drove them out
to tho Mocho Creek.* Mr. Dingee was
very favorably impressed with the out
look. According to the witness' story he
went into raptures over the prospectand
declared that sucn rirhti were worth $50,
--000. At that time Aylward was receiving
an income of $'225 a month from his prop
erty, and when tie was informed that by
the judicious outlay o? about $25,000 the
income could le increased to $1000 a
month, Aylward wanted to get in on the
ground floor. At that time his plant was
mortgaged to Mrs. Montgomery for $6000,
and there were no other incumbrances
upon it.
Tnere is another water plant owned by
Mr. Bernal, and at Mr. Dmgee'a sugges
tion Aylward furnished him (Dingee)
with the data of Mr. Bernal's plant and
income, as well as of his own. In the
course of their conversation Mr. Dingee
stated that if Aylward's plant would be
improved there would be no alternative
for Bernal but to quit.
Aylward admitted that he thought this
was a pretty good sch'me, and its there
were a few minutes to spare Mr. Aylward
drove his guests to the top of a neighbor
ing hill, where they all surveyed the town
while Mr, D ngee expressed his belief that
L vermore was one of tho most promising
fields for a water investment that could be
found.
Some time later Aylward, Dinge? nnd
others formed a company, in which Mr.
Dmge<* holds no stock anu of which Frank
J. Miflitt is president. Aylward declares
that his stock was not to be assessed, but
recently he was served witn a notice to
poy $10 a share, lie now Wants the court
to come to his relief and tho defendants
declare that they would be only too will
ing to allow Aylwnnl to take bock his
plant if he will pay â  hem the money ihey
have expended upon it. In cross-exam
ination Aylward admitted that his plant
was pretty well worn and that he was
willing to have it improve.i anJ enlarged.
This morning the c.ise was continued
till Saturday.

ALAMEDA. Cal., April 6.â Aithouph
the municipal election is only rive days
off, no one would believe that a cami'ai<;i)

tions are concerned. There is almost no
interest taken in any of the contents-
Some of the candidates have not even
gone to the e.xpenje of having the usual
campaign cards for circulation amon<;
their friends, and not a single meet ng has
been held or speech made except on tne
street corners in casual groups. There
are indications that the Anti-sa!oon
League is-quietly and effectively at work,
and will poll a bis; vote on the precinct
option question. The saloon men are do
ing practically nothing, whether from
fancied security in the result or careless
ness which way thn decision goes. At all
events the anti-saloon peop.e feel confi
dent that they will carry the greater por
tion of the thirteen precinctÂ«of the city.
INTELLECT AND INSTINCT
David Starr Jordan L?cture:
Before ths Second Unita
rian C Ã¼b.
Heredity and tte Grand Part It
P:a7s in ins Lives of Men
and Otter Animals.
Materialism cropped out in big spots in
David Starr Jordan's lecture before the
Second Unitarian Club last night. Fol
lowing the discoveries and reasoning of
Darwin, Spencer and Huxley, tbis was
unavoidable, for they dealt with the pal
pable visible things of life and these
things are of matter.
Few men living can invest an old sub
ject with the interest of newness so well
as can Professor Jordan. While handling
his theme with the grace and ease of per
fect control, he finds time to interject at
delightful intervals flashes of dry humor.
These are indeed restiul oases in what, to
the masses, would appear a dry desert of
scientific talk.
He spoke of the nervous system of
plants and animalÃ. In the tree the root
tips and tips ot the branches are the sen
sitive portion, the one seeking instinct
ively for moiiture and the other lor sun
shine. The tree is not capable of locomo
tion, and has no need of a brain. Its
brain is its root tips and tips of its
branches. This sense or instinct is of the
same nature as mind. But if the tree
could move from one place to anotherand
had to move, it would be necessary for i;s
roots and tips to report to a central office,
as the various senses report to the brain
of the animal.
The actions of tho lowor animals are re
flex or automatic. Their lives depend
upon those actions, for ii those automatic
mo7ements were not as regular and as cer
tain as clockwork the animais would aie.
"Step on a cat's tail, and you know what
the automatic response will be," said the
professor. He spoke of the horse auto
matically paw;ng the sand of the desert for
water, and of a ruockin -bird going into
spasms at the sij;ht of an owl, although
the bird may never have seen an owl be
fore. It is the hereditary dread of the
enemy of its race that seizes the bird. Our
horror of snakes goe? bucK to our ances
tors, who had to light them. The monkey
that is not alraid of snakes will be bitten
by them and will die.
It was said, remarked the professor, that
the Ego plays upon the brain as a human
being plays upon a piano, but he did not
think bo. Tiie Ego is not a separate in
dividual thing. It is a co-ordination of
all. Man's consciousness is the sum of
all the nerve forces. Every individual has
something of the chnracter of his father,
his mother, his grandfather and hisgrand
mother. This due to heredity. But there
is what is called the higher heredity, and
that is what a man makes out of himself.
Each man with the material which he has
can build a temple or a pigpen.
Reflex action or instinct rises by de
crees into intellect. Intellect has a choice
of responses; instinct has no choice.
The speaker toid about a baby monkey
which, although it had never seen an egg,
cracked a hole in the end of one by ;ap
ping the egg against its teeth and sucked
the contents. This monkey belonged to a
tree-climbing race and its ancestor robbed
birds' nest*. Another monkey of a race
which did not go egg-huntingused an eu'g
as if it were a nut and let the yelk escape.
Sensation goes into thought, and
thought into action. To remain abso
lutely impassive in the presence of an
idea is a difficult thing.

Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a

weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the most severe pain. There
is no let up to the mental suffering day or

such a strain men are (scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sen of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison and thus end all
his throubles. But providential inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged "his weak,
emaciated farts to natural size and vigor, and
i he now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to send his name and address may

SITTING IN JUDGMENT.
ihe Grand Jury Hear* Two Cases and
Refuees to Indict in
Either.
Collie Baker, a younp man who was
charted before the Grand Jury with hav
ing assaulted Mina Munson, a young girl
13 years of age, was giv n a hearing by
the Grand Jury yesterday, and succeeded
in fully vindicating himself of that charge.
He established a complete alibi.
Giovanni A.lniag:a, editor of I.' ltalia,
was before the Grand Jury with tne pur
pose of naving Cesaro Crespi, editor of
L'Messenpero, indicted for libel. The
article was read before :>nd interpreted fur
the jury, which dec ded that it was not
libelous under ihe law. being a renublica
lion of an article for which he had been
proceeded against in the Police courts.
A committee of tue jury visited the City
and County Hospital yesterday rooming,
but no definite action was taKen. The
matter will be taken up and perhaps dis
posed of at the sitting of the jury on Fri
day.

QUALTERS'
UNRULY TOES
They Pain Him Severely
Even After Being
Amputated.
QUEER CASE DEVELOPS
IN OAKLAND.
Strange Hallucination of a Man
Hurt in a Railway
Accident.
HIS PLEA TO A KINE-HEARTED
UNDERTAKER.
Would Not Rest Satisfi d Until He
Had Be n Show: His Severed
Member.
John Qualters, who was badly injured
by being struck by a train on the Oakland
broad gauge early on the morning of
March 28, liar furnished the officials of the
Oakland Receiving Hospital and Morgue
with a sensation that has not been equaled
for many days.
The unfortunate man was found through
the howling of his little do?, who stood
guard over his master's maimed body and
rai>ed his little voice in an appeal for
help until assistance came. At the Re
ceiving Hospital it was found that in ad
dition to a dislocated shoulder and other
painful injuries his right leg had been
crushed just above the ankle.
The physicians in charge of the Re
ceiving Hospital, where Qualters wa3
taken, tried hard to save ttie ioot, but it
was finally decided that amputation was
necessary to save the injured man's life,
and the leg was severed above where the
bone was crusiied and sent to the Morgue
lo be disposed of.
Quakers improved and seemed to pay
little attention to his loss until the night
fohowinc the operation, when the at
tendants were aroused by screams from
his cot. When they went to him he
seemed to be suffering agonies.
He said that the toes of his right foot
were all drawn up against the sole of the
extremity and that their nnnatural posi
tion was causing him the most intense
pain.
His attention was called to the fact th at
ihe loot had been amputated and was
then at the Morgue several blocks away.
â¢'I know that," moaned Qualters, "but
it hurts just the same. I know that the
toes are doubled up and I can't stand the
pain."
It was no use to argue with tbe patient,
so finally to quiet him the foot was sent
lor and shown him. When he saw ihat
the toes were in their natural position he
immediately declared that the pain was
leaving him and within a lew moments he
was as comfortable as his wounds would
permit. He insisted ihat the foot should
be kept at the hospital until morning,
which was done to satisfy him, and he
plept quietly for the remainder of the
night.
In the morning when an undertaker
faint to remove the foot and give it burial
Qualters asked to see him.
"When you put it under ground," he
pleiided, "please see that it is boxed up
neatly, and be sure thai the toes are
straight out as they should be. I know
that if they are not kept in that position I
shall feel it, no matter how my leg is, and
I don't want a return of that awful pain.
You will do that for me, won't you?"
The undertaker promised and Qualters
seemed satisfied. His chances of recovery
are bright despite the severity of his in
juries, and ne is already talking of the
wooden foot with immovable toes that
will take the place of the one that caused
him so much trouble.
ALLEGED BIG FRAUD.
Close of the Important Trial In Regard
to Valuable Alaikan Fisheries
and Canneries.
Judge Sea well is engaged in the trial of
the important suit of Bartlett Doe, W. J.
Gray, Thomas Pollard, the Tallant Bank
ing Company, W. S. Thompson, B. H.
Madison, Martin Madison a^id James
Madison against James Eva, H. J. Barling.
tne Alaska Packers" Association. W. B.
Bradford, J. Pentecost, S. J. Eva, William
Clift and Maria L. Barling.
The allegations in the complaint are of
asensatonal character and the amount
involved in ttip litigation is very largo.
Tbe plaintiffs allege bad faith on the
part of the defendants, specifically accus
ing James Eva, J. Pentecost and H. J.
Barling with having deceived the plain
tiffs in regard to the amount of the price
of certain fishing and cannery property in
Alaska sold by the plaintiffs to the Alaska
Packers' Association through James Eva,
Barling and Pentecost, as a committee.
The averment of the plaintiffs is as fol
lowb :
That the said statements of Barling, James
Eva and Pentecost so made to Â»aid board of
directors concerning the price to be paid by
said Alaska Packers' Association for said
properties were iahe and untrue; that said
agreement was noi a genuine agreement, but
â was labricated by said JameÂ» Eva. Barling
and Pentecost lor the purpose of imposing on
said board and concealing from them the real
price which seid Alaska Packers' Association
was willing to pay for sÃid properties; that
the said sale of said properties to the Alaska
Packers' Association had been in fact negoti
ated by said James Eva, Barling aid Pentecost
at the price of $300,000, instead of $136,000,
us reported by them, and the said Alaska
Packers' Association was willing to pay and
had aereed to pny the said sum of $300 000
lot the properties.
A decree of court is demanded for the
purpose of declaring James Eva, Barl ng
anri Pentecost tru-tees ior the plaintiffs to
the extent ol the difference between $300,
--000 and .$136,000; that a receiver be ap
pointed, and that the purchaser of the
property be required to pay the extra
money into court.
Testimony was closed yesterday, and
pending the engrossment of pleadings
Judge Seawell granted a continuance until
the 14th inst., when argument will be
heard.
JUDGE WALLACE SUSTAINED.
The Supreme Court L>enieÂ« a Writ of
Habeas Corpus to .J. A. Buckley.
The State Supreme Court yesterday de
nied the petition fora writ of habeas cor
pus in the case of Jerome A. Buckley,
convicted of stuffing election returns and
sentenced to five years' imprisonment in
San Quentin. A weefc or *o ago in one of
its decisions the Supreme Court practically
determined that Buckley was innocent of
the crime charged, noidingr that tiie evi
dence .'gainst the accused was insufficient.
1 1 practically, though not directiy, ordered
the dismissal of me case by the lower
court.
Judge Wallace, before whom the case
was tried, positively refused todisroiss the
case, and he passed severe criticisms upon
the Supreme Court for tioin^ beyond its
province in granting a new trial," having
reached its decision fr'>m the facts instead
of irom the law. Judge Wallace, however,
set â¦ tie case for it* second trial.
Buckley's attorneys yesterday petitioned
for a writ of habeas corpu-. Chief Justice
Beatty in passing upon the petition stated
that the former decision of ;he Supreme
Court simply ordered a new trial, but
made no provi-ion for the petitioner* im
mediate dismissal. Thus Superior Judge
Wallace's position was sustained, and
Buckley will have to stand a stcond trial.
E. FRANK ATTACHED.

Mark E. Frank, a manufacturer and
dealer in clothing and shirts at 2HH Kearny
street, was attached yesterday by Nathan
Frank on a claim of $3000. The suit was
b<rgun on a promissory note, executed by
the furnishing goods dealer several months
ago.
It was expected some time ago that the
attnehment would be levied, as Nathan
Frank, who is a relative of the defendant,
had threatened suit. It is bel eyed that
the matter will be straightened out and
that Mr. Franc will be permitted to con
tinue his business.

The " Hoodoo " That Is Causing: Consternation at ths Park.
MIDDLE-AGED BUT
STILL A CHILD
Death of a Woman Who
Was Thirty-Three
Inches Tall.
Her Mind Was No More Devel
oped Than That of a Little
Baby.
Medical Science Marve's That She
Lived So Longâ S le Wjs Thirty-
Four Years Old.
Catherine Meagher, who though 34
years o! age was only thirty-three inches
tall, died on Monday at the residence of
her parents, 304 Valencia street, of inani
tion. Tue case is one of the strangest
that ever came to the notice of the local
medical fraternity and will douotless be
closely investigated, if the parents will
permit ol it, in the interest of science.
Catherine Meauher was born in New
foundland in 1883, her parents being of
normal height ami development and with
nothing about them to indicate any
hereditary peculiarity that would pro luce
auch an offspring.
The child was apparently normal at its
birth, but it was soon noticed that the
only portion of its body that developed
was its head. Nor was the mental devel
opment in proportion to the increase ef
the craninm. At eight year* old the child
was small for its age and its head was of
abnormal size, and after that time there
was no noticeable increase in the size of
the body. The head steadily grew until
the time of her death it was a- large as
that of an ordinary human being.
Other childrenâ girls and boysâ were
born to the Meagiier family, and ail were
normal in size and intellect. A few years
ago the family removed to this City! and
ever since their advent here the unfortu
nate woman was kept in seclusion. She
nad the hands and feet of a baby, the
body of a child of 5 and the head of a
fully grown person.
The case is remarkable from the fact
that persons so alHicted seldom live be
yond early childhood, and even more sel
dom reach the age of 20. She never even
iearned to repeat the letters of the alpha
bet and was a constant care to hfÂ»r par
ents, though they paid every loving at
tention to their unfortunate daughter.
Death came j-'st as it does to babies, from
simple lack ol vitality, and the greatest
wonder is that she survived through the
days of her childhood and tbrougn thu
period that in normal beings would be
early womanhood.
Tbe physician who attended in the case
watched it carefmlv and did all in his
power to keep the vital spark from nicK
ering out, but medical science was of no
avail, and the feeble life germ gave way.
The Aieagtier family reiuses ;o give in
formation except to the physician who
attended, and desires the sorrow of their
life to be laid away with as little publicity
as characterized her iife.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 7, ISO" 7 .
LOOK OUT FOR
YOUR BUTTONS
There Is a Hoodoo in the
Park That Means
Mischief.
It Is an Indian Idol That Has
a Thiity-Year Record of
Deviltry.
The Strang* Story of Its Travels and
of the Desolation That Has
Fol owed in Its Wak.\
A costly Oriental vase, which had for
months rested snugly and peacefully in
one of the Park Museum niches, took a
notion to wobble the other day and then
tumble headlong to the marble floor with
a crash. The shattered pieces were
gathered up and consigned to the waste
bin. Scarcely an hour later another crash
was heard that fairly shook the Egyptian
structure. This time the damage was
traced to the roof, where it was found that
one of the ornamental spires had toppled
over and smashed itself into a thousand
piece*. And t tie next day something else
fell off its perch and again the day after
that. The attendant* began to grow ex
tremely alarmed.
"There's a hoodoo around this place
somewhere, and nobody can convince me
that there is not." said Superintendent
McLaren in a worried sort of way, when
he was told of the ruishars, and had
essayed !o solve tho mystery. "We will
nave to locate the thing and pet it out of
here, that's al!," he added wuh a deter
mined shake of his head.
Then was inaugurated the search for
th" evil-posse-sed object that was threat
ening to totally destroy the park's collec
tion of antiquities. It was not until yes
terday, however, that the "hoodoo" was
cornered, and now i; is dollars to marbles
that the tiling, if allowed to stay in the
park at all, will be relegated to some
isolated spot out on the hills, where it Trill
have little opportunity to exert its evil
influence.
It is an old Indian idol t li at. waÂ« re
cently discovered and purchased by John
L. Bardweil â that indefatigable searcher
for antiquities â and givt n by him to the
Park Commissioners. A glance at the
di>torte>! and horror-inspiring carving is
enough to convince any body lhat oven if
the thing did not possess the power to
wreck lives and homes, it ou~ht to. Just
whai it is, or what it was ever intended
to represent, not oven the museum cura
tors are able to divine. In appearance it
resembles an over-grown toad, possessed
of a dragon-like head, and a snout tha:
belongs to the family of swine. Clutched
between the two fore-legs, or tentacles, or
tins â or whatever they are â is the figure
in miniature of a human being; and from
the expression of Â«h.s image's counte
nance and the agonizing twistof its limb-,
it is plain to the beholder that it is not de
lighted with its job.
The record of ihis ruin-tracked reiic of
north-:-oast barbarity certainly entitles it
to the championship title in the "hoodoo"
c^ass. Wuerever it has gone disaster and
desolation i.aye been r fe. The question
now is, What nexl ?
To one Hans Anderson, an unscrupulous
and sacrilegious follower of the sea, is at
triouted much woe of the past thirty
years. Thi-. Hans Anderson Was a trader
who plied the Pacific Coast three decades
ago. O^ie cvi: moment he directed his
vessel toward Queen Charlotte Island on
the British Columbian coast. The Indians
on the island were at that time peaceable
enough, but knew naught of civilization.
They were idol-worshipers like all of the
tribes that inhabited the northwestern
country. Anderson invaded one of the
villages, ostensibly to do pome small trad
ing with the Indian*, but with the real
heart of a pirate. Awaiting a favorable
opportunity he and his men on a dark
light raided one of the native temples, if
such they could be called, and carried
away everything of value and everything
that even looked valuable. Then came
the retreat to the ship and a hasty setting
of sail.
Among the articles carried away from
the temple was tho hideous carving that
i-< now ensconced in the park museum.
The thelt of this idol was particularly be
reaving to the yueen Charlotte Inland na
tives and exasperating as well. While the
sails of Anderson's craft were Â» till sil
houetted against the horizon the medi
cine men or priests were called out and in
the presence of the enraaed populace
wer.t through a series of weird incanta
tions, the meaning of which was, so the
strange story goes, that for ages to come
a terrible curse and the worst of luck
would r>ur>ue those who should become
possessed of that cherished but ugly
image.
What happened?
Skipper Anderson sailed down to Van
couver and t ere died in horrible agony
from convulsions. He bad owed a debt to
the cnpta:n of the sealing schooner O. F.
Fowler, and in liquidation of that 00l ga
tion most of the deceased's possessions
fell into the hands of the creditor, among
them beini: that wuli-eyed and chill-in
spiring idol. The O. F. Fowier was as
stanch a cratt as ever saiieu the main, but
she could not sail with thai "hoodoo"
aboard. The very first vovafce she at
tempted with it as a passenger ended in
disaster. Sue wts crushed on the rocks
and the captain and several of the crew
were lost.
But the "hoodoo" lived. Alone with
the wreckage it floated ashore. It was
picked ui> by a fisherman whodied a w ek
later irom brain fever. In some way or
other ihe id^l got into the hands of some
whalers, who brought it to San Francisco
and sold it to Robert Llewelyn, who at
tbat timeâ this was ab.>ut twenty years
as;o â was wealthy and prosperous and
known and liked by everybody. "Bob,"
as lie was familiarly known alon,; the
water front, never suspected the evil spell
that possessed the curiosity, even when,
year after j-f-ar, ail sons of* financial re
veises be^et him and he saw his fortune
dwindling away.
He finally lound himself poor, and
opened a litiJe saloon with the hope of at
least keeping the wo.f from the door, and
all these years he never parted with the
Indian idol. ThÂ« climax came less than
a year apo w en poor Llewelyn fell down
a flight of stairs and sustained injuries
which caused his death.
In the disposal of Llewelyn's effects it
happened to be the misfortune ot John
Coyne, the tinsmith and plumber, whose
place of business is at 32 Clay street, to
be the purchaser of the cursed idol. Coyne
is alive yet, but he attributes his salvation
only to the (act that he opportunely got
r:d ol the "hoodoo," and that was only a
fortnight ago. During tne interimâ that
is, the period of his possession of the
imageâ he had all kind of bad luck.
"Wtjy, do you know," said Mr. Coyne
yesterday, "while 1 had that confounded
thing in my possession, my business went
to absolute rack and ruin. Believe me, I
coulii not gnt a thing to do, I cou.dn't sell
anything and I began to think seriously
of closing up my shop for good. That
idol sat up on a shelf and seemed to grin
all the broader the wor.-e my luck grew.
Finally I took it down and stowed it away
in a littie closet under the stairs, where I
change my clothes. And do you know, i
went in there ono day, and bless me if I
didn't see a wild-eyed Indian chief stand
ing right beside that idol. But I am
thanking my lucky 9tar9 that 1 got rid of
it at laft. 1 am satisfied that it is to blame
for all of my bad luck. John Bardwell
purchased it from me and I tell you it is a
good thing for him that ho got "it off his
liands right away. 1 felt sorry for those
folks out at tlio park. What do you sup
pose has happened since I got rid of that
tiling'/ Why, I have more business than
I can attend to. I have sold a dozen big
ranges and have to refuse orders for work.
I never was so prosperous before in my
lile."
Tftat's the story ot the "hoodoo." Peo
ple who visit the park" from now on need
not be surprised if their buttons pop off
their clothes, if they stub their toes, slide
on banana peels, of get knocked over by
bicycles. It will be the work of that idol.
PEOMISOUOUS BITER
Jumbo, a Vicious Dog, Ordered to Be
Shot.
Mrs. Annie Hansen, 14 Haven street,
appeared before Judge Campbell yester
day morning to answer a charge of keep
ing Â«n unregistered dog.
The dog, a big shaggy mongrel named
Jumbo, bit Mis-i Annie E na on April 1,
and also tried to bite off the right heel of
Attorney Pistolesi's boot. Pistolesi ap
peared as special prosecutor, and, aa the
evidence was complete, the Judge ordered
Chief Crowley to take Jumbo to a secluded
spot and there shoot or cause him to be
shot.
The duty of ending Jumbo's life was
relocated to Serjeant Duncan, and he
performed it with all necessary dispatch.

P-wer May Be Carried Through Los
Gatos as Far as
A viso.
The train from this City to San Jose
this morning will carry with it a party of
ten engineers, or more properly, an engi
neering party of ten. The party wiil be
led by K. Leo Van der Naillen. Its mis
sion is of the highest interest and import
ance to San Jose, Los Gato3, Alv;so and
their neighbors.
Speaking of tlie enterprise yesterday Mr.
Van derNaillen said : "We will go straight
to Mndrone by train, being joined at San
Jose by certain of the capitalists who form
the company, one ot whom no doubt will
be John Ryland, banker und large nolder
in the water company and who has been
one of the principals in the movement.
They will lead us to the point, on the Los
Gatos Cieek I believe it is. irom which we
are expected to operate. We take with us
a fuil equipment of instruments for mak
ing complete testa of atmospheric and
otuer conditions. Our first purpose is to
determine the horsepower that may be
developed by tnÂ« natural or artificially
combined streams of the mountains. We
go just at this time to get the streams at
their best, enjoying the spring flood. The
plan is to discover means of turning the
lesser streams into the greater by means
of flumes or pipes and thus augmenting
the volume. We will measure the horse
power of the stream* as they are an<i as
they may be strengthened as described.
"The loss of conductine electricity for
long distances is a prime factor in any
problem ot this kind. This is affected
very greatly by the atmo-pheric condi
tions. To gauze these we ehall run two
lines of wire mid, by means of what is
fnown as the Wheatstone system and the
use of the flashlight galvonometer, get the
insulating conditions of the atmosphere
at the highest altitude. This will give us
the practical loss of energy in the trans
miÂ«s:on over a given distance. If it is
found possible and leasible the wire< and
power will iÂ« carried to Aivis>o, where
shipping facilities by water may be had."

OLYMPICS
ACCUSED
Bay City Wheelmen Retali
ate as to Charges in
the Protest.
UNSPORTSMANLIKE CON
DUCT ALLEGED.
Two Relay Riders Said Not to Ec
Members of the Protesting
Cub.
THE WINNERS RFJOICE OVER
VICTORY.
Sunday Track Racing Will Begin on
the iÃtti Inst.â Entries to
Close on the 10 h.
In the midst of their jubilee over the
winning of the big relay race and becom
ing the permanent owners ol the Varney
trophy, the victorious Bay Citys have
found time to return the shot aimea at
them by the disapnointed Olymnic Club
riders, and, unless the protest of the Jat
ter orgasizaiion be withdrawn, there is
promise of a lively time in wheeling
circles.
To be brief the tune of the Bay Citys is
this: "We may have been guilty of slight
technical violations of the rules, though
we deny it, but if we were, there were
others."
In fact the doughty winners of the cup
say flatfooted ttiat the O ympics were
guilty of far more flagrant violations of
the rules than were they, and th,at under
the circumstances tiie best course of the
Olympics would have been silence. H.
L. Kay, captain of the Bay City Wheel
men, voices the feeiines and words of his
confreres in the following lancuaee:
I am sorry that the Olympics have seen fit to
start r controversy of thiskind, lor It will only
result in their bei ng convicted of far more
glaring violations of the rules than any club
that participated. They say that uÂ« had pace
makers on almost every relay and tin l several
riders crossed the tape with "Kenna at the lin
ish and that the rules were violated in this
tray. Not one of our men was paced, but we
did have numerous ineii ou every relay, bin
lor what purpose ?
We desire to have our forces thoroughly
orÃaiiized, and thp reason of having the men
staked out at all poi:,;.- was to have tnein
handy snould our men need fresh wheels or
permissible aid of any kind. Not one of those
who acted as trailer or assistants paced our
men. ami we can prove it.
As to Vincent pacing Krafts that is all bosh.
Krafts is a man who needs no pacing, and
upver asks or wants it.
When he begins to difÂ» out there are few men
who can hoid him, and Vincent merely lol
lowed our German friend until he thought it
time to light out â which was alter he had
covered three miles of his relayâ and then the
trailer was left far behind. As to Kelina's
finish, we have no particular excuse tv make.
JJe was riding a wheel that was partially dis
abled, and the trailers kept as clost- as possible
to preclude the chance of his neing leit wirn
out a wneei should his own break down. He
was a winner beyond the shadow of a doubt,
and ho could have broken down twice and
been compelled to change wheels and still
won.
Wa committed no genuine foul, and the
claim of the Olympics will nut be allowed, I
am sure.
Our trailers had orders to give their wheels
to members of other clubs when our men did
not need them, and 1 think this shows that
we rode a fair and manly r.ice. They say that
they don't waut the cui>. I suppose they
would hand it back t-> us if they snould suc
ceed in having oÂ« disqualified; t.ut you may
believe that we would not accept it tinder such
circumstances. We want nothing that we
cannot and do not win on our merits.
In contrast here Is the conduct of the Olym
pics. They had two men nnd perhaps three
who were not regular meml'TH of their cub
and had no right to ride in the race. Tne
Olympic Club is a corporation anil us consti
tution and by-laws prescribe how members
shall be elected. Simply because men Â«ear
the Olympic Club emblem an have the privi
lege oi using the Olympic Club rooms does
not make them members.
Cook, who roiJe tne second relay for them,
was never elected a member ot the club n >r
passed on by the advisory election committee,
nor was Wing, who took the last relay. We
can prove that they were not Olympic Club
members.
The rules of the race were explicit on the
point of membership. It was me same way
two years ago when Edwards, who hail been a
member but ten days, rode his relay.
We try to be sportsmen and to ride manly
races, and we shall continue to do so, no mat
ter what may be said or done by disgruntled
clubs.
Chairman Adams of the road racine
committee of the California Associated
Cycling Clubs left the City yesterday ior
Chico on a short business trip. Before
sroing he stated that as soon as he tp
turned he would tHke up ttie matter of
the protests of the Olympic Ciub Wheel
men and the Reliance* club Wleelmen io
the awarding of the trophy to the Bay
City Wheelmen, the winners. He also
3 tateo that as president of the Olympic
Club Wheelmen he should urge that club to
withdraw its protest, and also felt confi
dent that the Reiiance Club would do the
same. Nothing was to be gained, he said,
by protesting and to him it seemed a very
unsportmanslike proceeding.
Meanwbile the Bay Citys have the cup,
and have duly celebrated the winning of
it. It will De remembered that a large
party ot Eastern professional track-racing
men went East the morning of ihe reiay
race. At their request the result of the
race was wired to thorn and the telegram
caught tne train at Fresno. In the even
ing the Bay Citys received the following
reply: "Congratulations from all on
board. Bay Citys forever."
The club has several members now resi
dent in the East, all of wtioin were wired
the result ot the event and telecraphe 1
congratulatory messages in return. One
of the most enthusiastic, H. A. Goldarri,
now situated in Toronto. Canada, wired:
"Well, Great Scott. Hurrah. Hurroo.
There is m man in Toronto who is setting
them up."
The club on the night of the race rÂ«ent
the following letter to the* Acme Club
Wheelmen of Oakland, which was person
ally sinned by tiftv-eight members:
Greeting* from the Bay City Wheelmen to
the only team we leared in tlie country, and
the on!y team wit 1> a right to be with us at
Hit; finish thiit has not entered a protest.
President Rv.ain of the associated club*
stated yesterday that, although the present
series of relay races was ended by the Bay
City* winning the Varney trophy three
times, it was more than likely that the
association itself wnuid put up a trophy
to be contested for yearly, that the race
in icnt be perpetuated.
The first attempt at Sunday track racing
will be made on Aoril 18 unoer a sanction
issued by the California Associated Cycling
Clubs to the Velodrome. The events and
prizes will be as follows:
One-liÃlf mile handicap. Amateur; prizes,

The entries will close Saturday, April 10.
An adjourned meeting of the board of
control of the associated clubs will be held

LOOKING aHE A D Golden Medical
Discovery. It doesn't work miracles ;
but it does what other medicine can't do
and what doctors say can't be done â un-
til tbey sec it doss right under their noses
â it cures consumption. â Not always ;to
Bay that would he an exaggeration, hut
in r^lar^e majority of cases ; in advauced
cases which have been given up as hope-
less.
The "Discovery" is not called a con-
sumption cure ; it is a blood-maker. It
gives energy to the blood-making organs
to create new blood, full of healthy red
corpuscles. This rapid supply of pure,
rich, red blood drives out all diseases that
have their roots in the blood : Consump-
tion is one of these ; scrofula, malaria,
eczema, erysipelas, catarrhâ are others.
It is absurd to doctor them separately as
lung, or skin, or head diseases. They
must be driven out of the blood. You
can rely on the 'Golden Medical Dis-
covery " to do this every time.
It is not a patent medicine.^ It is the
perfected result of 30 years, practical ex-
perience by one of the most skillful phy-
Bicians and eminent medical authorities
in this country:â Dr. R. V. Pierce, Chief
Consulting Physician to the Invalids' Ho-
tel and Surgical Institute, Buffalo, N. Y.
