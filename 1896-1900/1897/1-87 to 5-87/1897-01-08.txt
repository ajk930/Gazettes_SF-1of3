SHORTRIDGE'S STAR IS RISING
Increase in the Defections
From the Perkins
Ranks.
TRICKERY ACTED AS A
BOOMERANG.
Many Follow Judge Waymire in
Promptly Repudiating the
Alleged Caucus.
BY TUESDAY THERE WILL BE A
LANDSLIDE
In Eloquent, Forceful Language Senator More
house of Santa Clara Will Nominate Samuel
M. Shortridge for United States Senator,
to Succeed George C. Perkins.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 7. â Several more defections from the
Perkins ranks have been noted since Judge Waymire repudiated
the trickery, fraud and misrepresentation by which the agents for
the Senator have attempted to secure his re-election.
The Senator's star is low down on the horizon, and a landslide
may b~ expected before next Tuesday.
There was a scene of unusual activity to-night in the headquar
ters of Samuel M. Shortridge. People in the hotel thought that a
reception was taking place HundreJs crowded in and out of the
rooms to shake hands with and to congratulate'the brilliant lawyer
who has made such a game fight against his opponent at what seemed
at first glance to be the most fearful odds.
Judge Daly, a member of the Code Commission, a lawyer the
soundness of whose opinion is admitteJ by the profession at large,
Â«aye his opinion to-night that the Republican legislators have failed
to hold a caucus.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 7.â One of
the most peculiar doctrines advocated by
the managers of George C. Perkins at the
present session of the Legislature is that
a political caucus is binding not only
upon those who may have attended it
but upon those who did not. There may
be something funnier than this under the
skies, but if so the late lamented Bill Nye
departed this earthly sphere ere his facile
pen discovered it.
That there 13 any such thing according
to any political custom pertaining to such
matters as a binding caucus which a ma
jority of the members of the Legislature
did not attend was hitherto unknown to
legisla'ors and thp general public as well.
But Mr. Perkins' managers have discov
ered this X-ray of political affairs, and
while contributing to their own felicity
resulting from the knowledge of a posses
sion of superior insight, have added to the
political history of California a joke that
Will be perennial.
When it is ciaimed by Mr. Perkins'
managers that an alleged caucus com
posed of fifty-nine members of the Legis
lature can bind the Republican party to
their choice for Senator, or even those
who attended the farcical proceeding to
the result of its vote, then it logically fol

Assemblyman From] Bodie.
The San Francisco Call
lows that a conference of fifty or forty or
thirty members would have tbe same
binding effect, either upon the party itself
or tnose who attended it.
Such a conclusion leads to a further and
more ridiculous one, that an aspirant for
Senator or any other office within the gift
of the Legislature could hold a "caucus"
of twenty members and bind them to-day,
and another one of ten members and bind
them to-morrow, and the next day hold
a third of five members and bind them,
until he could climb upon the pedestal of
conceit and shout in thunder tones to the
multitude that the whole party was
"bound 17 as securely as Samson.
The pretensions of the Perkins' man
agers that the pretended caucus of last
Monday evening was of any binding
effect either upon tfie Republican party
or those who attended it is regarded with
the utmost ridicule, even by many of
those who through courtesy did attend.
As one who was present aptly expressed
it: "I have laughed so much in my
sleeve over so absurd a claim that it is
worn threadbare at the elbow."
It will be remembered that at the last
election at Sacramento an attempt was
made upon the part of a candidate before
the Legislature to claim that the Republi

can members thereof were bound by a so
called caucus of less than a majority mem
bership of the Legislature.
Bnt at that time Senator Perkins, who
was the successful candidate, through the
efforts of his managers succeeded rightly
in casting ridicule upon so absurd a cUim.

RISE OF THE TIDE.
Samuel M. Shortrldge's Strength
Constantly Increasing, While the
Perkins 800 m Is Bursting:.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Jan. 7.â The
headquarters of Samuel M. Shortridge at
the Golden Eagle Hotel were the scene of
unusual activity to-night. One would
have thought that some grand reception
was in progress, for during the whole of
the afternoon and evening the stairs were
kept hot with the busy tread of visitors.
It was the rising of the tide that would
safely float the Shortridge ship, while at
the same time the battered hull of the
Perkins boom was being dashed higher
and higher upon the Scylla of blasted
hopes.
There was rejoicing in the ranks of the
Shormdgo forces, for they had been aug
mented by the addition of several who
had signed the call for the so-called cau
cus and who realized that it this State was
to be upheld in the Senate of the Nation it
must be done by a man of more force,
more eloquence, more energy and more
earnestness and self-sacrifice than have
been recently exhibited on behalf of Cali
fornia. At first these members had been
under the impression that they had com
mitted themselves by signing the roll and
attending the conference at the suggestion
of Milt Green and the oily W. B. Hamil
ton. They did so because they had been
informed that there had signed and would
be present a sufficient number of legisla
tors to do business.
Wben they found that they had been
deceived, they still felt that they had un
willing y and unknowingly been herded
into the Perkins corral by false and
fraudulent representations, and that they
were bound in honor, despite that fact, to
abide by the decision of those who did
attend, plus tlie proxy of Assemblyman
Sims, who at that time was lying on a bed
of pain in the Sutter Club.
But the action of Judge Waymire and
his friends in repudiating the action of
ihe conference, the opinion of gentlemen
learned in the law and of high repute in
the profession, convinced the deceived
ones that they were not bound in con
science by the decision of a political
fiasco; that it were folly to follow the
rainbow illusion of a bursting bubble, and
they went away from the side of a leader
who at tis best hat never Inspired them
either with admiration or enthusiasm.
And here must be noted a fact none the
le3B tignifiant because well known. There
never was any enthusiasm or admiration
for Senator Perkins. Although hia agents
claimed sixty-one out of the seventy-four
Republicans 111 the Legislature, these
sixty-one have never sent forth eyen a
solitary cheer for him. No one has spoken
with any warmth of him. No one has
praised him, no one has admired him. No
one has stood upon the curbÂ«tone and told
what good things he has done for Califor
nia. If even a drunken man should stand
in front of the Golden Eagle Hotel, where
all the politicians are beebiving and buz
zing from sunset till 2a. m., and propose
three cheers or even one cheer for Mr.
Perkins, the crowd would run out to get a
look at the man who had thus exhibited a
mental, mornl and political aberration of
mind.
When Samuel If. Shortridgacarae down
from the Capitol yesterday afternoon and
got on the edge of the crowd on the hotel
tidewalk it took hjm just hÂ«,"Â«n bour to
travel fifty feet from the cornei to the ho
tel entrance. He had to stop and shake
hands with more than a hundred people,
all of whom knew and admired him for
the plucky fight be is making.
The star of Perkins is sinking low down
on the horizon, and that of Samuel M.
Shortridge is rising. The Perkins forces
PATRIOTIC AND PROGRESSIVE.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 7.â N. E. Malcolm, a Republican member of the
Assembly from Santa Clara County, spoke of the contest for United States Senator in
an interview to-night. He said:
"I regard Samuel M. Shortridge as one of the ablest men in public life, and I
believe in the rule that men trained to the duty of performing public service should
be recognized. The study and time which a man gives to qualify himself with
knowledge necessary to serve the people should count for something.
"In my judgment Mr. Shortridge in the United States Senate would be able to
accomplish more eood for the State of California than any other man mentioned for
that office. I admire his talents, his intellect and his loyalty to Republican principles.
Many prominent citizens of Santa Clara County, men of the highest character and
influence, have requested me to vote for Mr. Shortridge. The same request has been
made by the Republican County Committee of that county.
"All men in Santa Clara County appreciate the ability of Mr. Shortridge. They
comprehend his worth as a man, for they have observed his steady advancement,
unaided by wealth, to the top of the ladder. They recognize that he possesses the
qualities of leadership. He is true to his friends; he is loyal to his party; he is
patriotic and progressive. I can say frankly to you that lam unpledged, but I must
confess my opinion that Mr. Shortridge is the ablest man mentioned for the office
of Senator."
have not been able to hold their own
much less to obtain the additional vote
which they claim is all they need. Sev
eral have followed the example of Judge
Way mire, and have repudiated the meth
ods which have elicited the condemnation
of all honorable and fair-minded men.
The names of those who have come Into
the ranks of the opposition since the al
leged caucus was held are kept secret for
the present for reasons which are obvious.
There will be more additions to the roll
to-morrow.
There may be a landslide before Tues
day.
Judge Daly of the Code Commission, a
lawyer whose opinion carries great weight
with it among the members of the pro
fession on the Pacific Coast, said to a Call
reporter last nitjht that a caucus must
have the numbers or the power to accom
plish the object of the desire of its major
ity, else it ceases to be a caucus and must
be considered only as a conference. He
wished to state at the outset of the inter
view that he did not care to give an
opinion as to the recent meeting of fifty
eight or fifty-nine Republicans the other
night, but he would speas in general
terms, without reference to happenings
herein Sacramento. There is no law reg
ulating legislative caucuses. The general
practice and precedent of the past are the
guides.
A caucus is an agreement among a cer
tain number of men sufficient to accom-
plish a certain purpose. It is in one sense
a contract, but if the party contracting is
without power to do tho thing contracted
it ceases io be a contract or a caucus and
becomes merely a conference. A caucus
is something from which results should
flow. A certain number of men having
adverse interests may meet for the pur
pose of accomplishing "some object, each
with the hope that he will succeed in har
monizing the other interests for the bene
fit of his own, and prepared to yield in
the interest of the common cause.
Now, if there are not a sufficient num
ber to accomplish the purpose there is
no caucus and nobody i 3 bound by it, be
cause where there is no power to fulfill
the contract there can be no valid con
tract. It becomes a conference, and can
bind neither those who take part nor
Â»hose who absent themselves. Even \
jaiicas cannot bind those who do not tale
part in it.
MOREHOUSE'S STAND.
In an Eloquent Speech He Will
Nominate Samuel M. Short
ridge for Senator.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 7.â Speak-
ing of Samuel M. Shortridge to-ntght,
Senator H. V. Morehouse of Santa Clara
said:
'â¢I have known him from boyhood. I
knew of his character and strength and I
am for him. I shall express my judg
ment of his worth when I place him in
nomination for United States Senator in
the Senate next Tuesday."
It is iii the air that Senator Morehouse,
who is recognized as a brilliant and
finished orator, will make the effort
of his life in presenting the
name or Mr. Shortridee to his
fellow-Senators next Tuesday. The re
port that Mr. Morehouse will sneak, after
careful and finished preparation, has en
listed atteniion in literary circles in Sac
ramento. The desire to hear the orator
wili cause great demand for places in the
Senate chamber.
UNION OF THE MINORITY.
Democrats and Pcpullsts Meet to
Consider a Candidate for
Senator.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 7.âDemo
crats and Populists met this evening in
the Supreme Courtroom to consider what
candidate the minority should support in
the contest for the United States Senator
ship. Assemblyman A. B. Sanford called
the conference to order. Assemblyman J.
L. Dryden of San Diego was cbosen chair
man and W. T. Hamilton, clerk of the
Democratic minority, acted as secretary.
Senator Braunhart made a suggestion
that the members organize as a united
conference, representing nil the members
opposed to Republican princ pies. He
stated that the call for a caucus emanated
from the Assembly. The Democrats in
the Senaie, he remarked, were present
voluntarily. The Senators attending were
Lnngford, Braunnart, Dwyer and Hall.
Among the Assemblymen were Caminetti,
Godfrey, Treacy, Dryden, Keables, Boone
and twenty others.
A motion to go into executive session
prevailed. When all wiio were not on
titled to be present were excluded, a sug
gestion was made that a choice of the
minority for United States Senator should
be expressed. This suggestion precipi
tated a hot debate. The point was raised
that there were many absentees who were
not notitied of the caucus.
One member sought to establiah that
the Democrats being a majority of the
minority, were entitled to name the candi
date. He said it bad been agreed when
tuaion was made that if the Populists
elected, more members of the Legislature
than the Democrats, that Thomas V. Cator
was to receive the nomination. Now, that
the Democrats were in the ascendency, a
popular free-tilver and incorruptible
Democrat such as Judge Maguire, should
be declared the choice ot Democrats and
Populists alike.
A Populist member asserted that he was
bound to cast his vote for Tkomas V.
Cator.
Assemblyman Treacy made a vigorous
speech, in which he declared that Ma
guire represented in Congress both Dem
ocrats and Populists who were opposed to
the gold standard and in favor of the free
coinage of silver. He spoke of Maguire as
a man whom millions could not buy and
held it to be the duty of the minority to
stand by the Congressman.
"For myself," said Treacy. "I am bound
to cast my vote for Maguire."
When questioned closely as to whether
he would abide by the choice of the cau
cus he replied that he was bound to vote
for Maguire.
Senator Langford said that there was no
issue in his district when he was a candi
date before the people but gold and silver.
He said: "Ca<tor came out as a candidate
for United States Senator too soon and
his coming out cost me many votes. In
tnis contest I have a favorite â a man who
poured out his wealth to make the cam
paign for the free coinage of silver. 1
propose to cast my vote for Charley
Lane."
Senator Dwyer moved to take an in

formal ballot and adjourn until Monuay
evening.
Senator Braunhart spoke highly of
j Judge Maguire as a statesman, bat
thought he was lukewarm in his (Braun
hart's) cause during the iast campaign.
After prolonged discussion i: was agreed
that the caucus to be known as the union
! minority should adjourn to meet at 5
I o'clock Monday afternoon. The pro
gramme is for Democrats and Populists to
meet each in their own camp at that hour,
discuss the situation and then meet jointly
at 8 o'clock the same evening to ballot for
a choice. Eloquent speeches were made
to show the necessity for all men opposed
j to the single gold standard, ail the Bryan
Populists and all the Bryan Democrats to
combine and present a solid Iront. A sin
gle reference was made in the caucus to
Perkins, as a man who might be voted for
in an emergency. The suggestion evolced
a laugh of derifion.
IN THE SENATE.
Passage of Resolutions Asking for
Protection and Protesting
Against Refunding.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Jan. 7.â ln the
Senate this morning Smith of Bakersfield
introduced the resolution adopted by the
Republican caucus yesterday requesting
the California delegation in Congress to
have incorporated in the tariff bill now
being drafted protective duties for all
agricultural, horticultural, pastoral and
mineral industries of California and her
sister Slates.
Braunhart offered a resolution for the
free coinage ot silver as a substitute, but it
was promptly ruled out of order.
Seawell's substitute declaring agaiust a
protective tariff as fostering trusts and
monopolies met a similar fatf>.
Smith and Withingtou (Republicans)2

Seawell, Doly an>l Braunbart opposed it.
Langford asked that action be post
poned, aa the resolution authorized by the
Fruit-growers' Association wculd sqon be
presented. This was refused and the reso
lution adopted. All the Republicans voted
aye, Langford also casting his vote with
the nfnjority.
The joint resolution in opposition to the
funding bill, passed by the Assembly yes
terday, was then taken up and passed by
a unanimous vote. There was no debate
and not a word of opposition offered. The
resolution will now be transmitted by
telegraph to the California Congressional
delegation.

SANTA CLARA'S NEEDS.
Appropriations for the Aarnews
Asylum and the High and
Normal Schools.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 7.â Senator
H. V. Morehouse, who represents Santa
Clara County, will be found to be one o!
the hardest workers in this Senate, tie
is well known throughout the leucth and
breadth of the State, having traveled
from one end to t. c other in the cause of
the success of the Republican party. Mr.
Morehouse made a great hit during the
campaign of Governor Markhani. He
traveled and spoke from the stamp with
the Governor in almost every county in
the State, and contributed much to the
success of the party that year. The Sen
ator is an effective speaker and has an in
timate knowledge of public affairs, which
qualities have been of great value to him
self and the party. It will be remembered
that his speech at the Wigwam in San
Jtf'rancisco last fall was ono of the most en
tertaining and effective of the series.
The Senator is devoting all of his time
here to the consideration of legislation af
fecting Santa Clara and the State at large.
He will ask for tbe usual appropropria
tions for the State insane asylum at
Agnews and for the State Normal School
in San Jose. The appropriation for the
asylum will include a sum for building
certain colleges, after the plan of Eastern
asylums, for the care of those who are not
chronic lunatics, and aiso an appropria
tion of $15,000 for the purpose of sinking a
gas well on the premises, the same as the
asylums in Stockion, where a saving of
many thousands a year has been effected
in the cost of lighting and heating.
The Senator will also ask for an appro
priation for the Soldiers' Home, at-Ever
green, also a bill to have the State cede
the right of the city of San Jose to build
on the Normal School ground in San Jose
a high-school building, the city having
voted an issue of bonds for $75,000 for that
purpose. The city originally ceded to the
State twenty-eight acres of land, on which
the Normal School was afterward built.
The deed from the city to the State pro*
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 1897.
vided that in the event of the failure of
the State to keep the Normal School on
the ground the property would revert to
the city. The grounds have been found
too large for the Normal School and it has
not been practicable to have them prop
erly cared for, the appropriation Deing too
small. The building of the High School
on the property will materially reduce the
expense of caring for the grounds, will
Beautify the place and will save the city
of dan Jose the expenditure of $20,000 for
a building site.
The Dill will receive the support of the
Board of Trustees of the State Normal
School, the faculty and the State Board of
Education and the citizens generally.
Senator Morebouse will also introduce a
bill to create a third Superior judj:e for
that county. This is a very important
measure. Judicial business has grown so
fast that the calendars are from three to
four months behind, and it is impossible
for the two judges to keep up with the
rush of work. The bill will be supported
by every attorney in the county.
In the matter of general Slate legisla
tion Senator Morehouse will introduce a
resolution to amend the constitution so as
to permit of the creation of two interme
diate courts, of three Judges each, to be
elected by the people and possessing all
tbe qualifications of Justices of the Su
preme Court. The resolution proposes to
change the constitution as to jurisdiction
by dividing the business that now goes to
the Supreme Court, so that about half of
the business will go to the intermediate
courts. The creation of the intermediate
court will do away with the Supremo
Court Commission.
ELECTION REFORMS.
Senators Stratton and Braunhart
Working to Purify Primary
Election Methods.
SACRAMENTO. Cau, Jan. 7.-Senator
Fred S. Stratton of Alaraeda and Senator
Braunhart of San Francisco have prepared
bills looking toward the doing: away of
boss rule in primary elections and munici
pal affairs. The Senator from Aiameda
has a bill which he says is the result of
many months' careful study and work.
It provides for the establishment of a non
partisan election commission in each
county, which shall have general supervi
sion over the primaries. Candidates for
office go on the ticket by petition. All
primaries of all parties must be held on
the same day, at the same place, with a
separate board of officers and separate
ballot-boxes for each party. It will be re
quired of each voter that he shall register
a statement of his party affiliation at least
ten days prior to the primary.
This is to do away with the common
evil of Democratic heelers voting at Ke
publican primaries in order to help out a
Republican boss, and the evil of Republi
can heelers voting at Democratic primaries
in return for the favor. No candidate at
a primary election can expend on or be
fore the day of election any greater sum
than he is allowed to expend under the
general election law. In other words the
bill applies the purity of el ction law to
primaries. The election officers shall be
appointed by a non-partisan board of
election commissioners, selected by lot
from the assessment- roll, and who are
pledged to service without compensation.
Senator Braun hart's bill is more simple.
It provides tat at the general election in
1898, and thereafter, there shall be elected
in every election precinct in the State one
member to represent his district in the
governing committee or body for each
county or city and county of any political
party, association or organization, which
at the general election last preceding
polled at least 3 per cent of the entire vote
of the county or city and county. Nomi
nees are required to file a petition of 10
per cent of the vote cast at the last gen
eral election. The name of such peti
tioner shall be printed on the official bal
lot by the Clerk or Registrar, as the case
may be, and the persons elected shall
serve for two years. This governing body,
whenever situated within the limits of
any city or town, shall have exclusive
jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to
the party organization. The governing
committee shall have power to fix the
time for holding primaries, etc.
Senator Braunhart Hopes to be able to
incorporate the essential features of bis
plan into Senator Stratton's bill, if such
can be done without destroying the con
sistency of one or both.
THE STATE UNIVERSITY.
What Senator Stratton Proposes to
Accomplish for the Educational
Institution.
SACRAMiSNTO, Cal., Jan. 7.â Senator
Stratton of Alameda will introduce a bill
to raise the income of the State University
by a gradual tax of 1 cent on each $100, so
as to provide for additional maintenance,
improvements, etc. The proposition has
been indorsed by tbe alumni and the re
cent? as being necessary for the welfare of
the institution of learning. This continu
ous tax will be so light that the individual
taxpayer will hardly feel it at all, the ad
ditional tax to a man who pays on an
assessment of $1000 not exceeding 5 cents
a year.
Another bill will enlarge the powers of
the board of regents of the university so
that they will not be hampered with so
much red tape when tbey proceed to erect
college buildings. The measure is to be
introduced at the suggestion of Mrs.
Phoebe Hearst, who recently donated
$2,000,000 to be expended in new univer
sity buildings, her desire being that the
work of construction should proceed at
once and not be delayed by injunctions
and other disagreeable features of public
work. As the proposed buildings are to
be paid for with her own money the Sen
ator thinks that she should have a voice
in the matter of their ppeedy construction.
Another bill will be for the relief of ti.e
Affiliated Colleges and will return from
the treasury $125,000 of tbe building fund
which Was allowed to lapse by non
compliance with certain requirements of
the law.
PRESUMPTION OF ERROR.
A Very Important Modification of
the Law on Behalf of
Litigants.
SACRAMENTO, Oal., Jan. 7.â A very
important modification of the law, and
one which will be welcomed by litigants,
will be attempted by Senator Stratton of
Alameda in his bill shortly to be intro
duced reversing the presumption of error
in the Supreme Court. Undor the law as
it now stands, it is presumed thai error in

COUNTY CHARTERS.
An Innovation In the County Gov
ernment Act to Elect Boards
of Freeholders.
SACRAMENTO. â¬al., Jan. 7.â Senator
Stratton of Alameda will introduce a bill,
in the shape of a constitutional amend
ment, giving to counties the same right as
is given to cities to hold freeholder elec
tions for the purpose of framing a county
government act, as to the number of offi
cials, their salaries, deputies, etc. It will
remove a grave objection to the present
act by enabling a county to pay an official
a salary of $1000 without the State dictat
ing that he shall be Daid $10,000. It is a
step in tbe direction of borne rule by
counties that will be welcomed in all parts
of the State.
PROPOSED LEGISLATION.
Regent Reinstein Brings Bills Re
lating- to the State
University.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 7.â Regent
J. 6. Reinstein, representing the State
University, arrived last night and placed
biils touching that institution in the
hands of H. E. Wright of the Assembly
and F. S. Etratton of the Senate. In the
Assembly this iorenoon Mr. Wright in
troduced the measure for a permanent in
crease of the tax levy to maintain the uni
versity. The law now provides that the
State Board of Equalization shall levy 1
cent annually for university maintenance.
Mr. Wright's bill authorizes an additional
levy of 1 cent annually for ten years, di
recting that half the amount secured from
the State shall be used for the construc
tion of buildings. The existing 1 cent
and the proposed addition will give the
institution from ?225,000 to $250,000 per
annum, according to the total valuation
of the assessable property. As the wealth
of the State increases and the assessment
roll expands, the amount realized by lhe
tax will increase.
Another university measure will be In
troduced, perhaps, to-morrow. This will
exempt the regents from tne operation of
the existing law relating to the construc
tion of public buildincs, which require
plans to be advertised for. Mrs. Hearst,
in her proposed gifts to the university of
$1,200,000, will furnish plans for the
buildings which she proposes to build.
Mr. Eeinstein is positive that Mrs. Hearst
will not consent to plans supplied by the
State, She has her own ideas about the
architecture of the structure, and the
regents will be guided by the judgment
of the eminent architects to be engaged
under her direction. The existing law Is
said by the Attorney-General to apply to
the university as well us to other public
institutions. Judge Wallace insists that
the regents are now wholly independent
of the law, and to make assurance doubly
sure of non-application the Legislature is
asked to declare the exemption.
The bill to reappropriate the lapsed
$125,000 appropriation for Affiliated Col
leges in San Francisco will be placed in
the hands of Judge Dibble. He will be
charged with the duty of making it clear
to the Assembly that the measure is not a
new appropriation, but simply one restor
ing to the regents the right to s>pend
money appropriated two years ago, and
now in the general fund of the treasury.
The lapse of this $125,000 will be cited as a
reason why the university should be
exempted from the building law, because
the delays In the construction of the
Affiliated Colleges were caused in a
measure by the efforts of the regents to
conform to the provisions of this law.
Mr. Reinstein says that $75,000 derived
from the tax levy should be immediately
used to procure a water supply for the
university. The institution is now pay
ing $250 a month. He says the voice of
the leading press throughout the State

/ Colonel T. F. Barry, commandtr of the

member of the sub-committee of five from
the Committee of Fifty Citizens of San
Francisco to hasten the adoption and
transmission of the resolutions opposing
the refunding scheme now pending in
Congress. Colonel Barry was delighted
to-day when the Senate readily concurred
in the resolutions adopted by the Assem
bly. He was also gratified to learn tnat
Governor Budd had telephoned from San
Francisco directing that the resolutions
be wired to Washington immediately on
their adoption. Incidentally it is observed
that the Governor deems it safe to leave
the State Capitol for the metropolis while
a Republican Legislature is 10 session. It
is asked if he would dare absent himself
thus if a Democratic Legislature had the
works.
Colonel Barry is especially pleased that
all reference to Government ownersnip
and operation of ths Pacific road was ex
cluded from the resolutions.
The Assembly to-day let down the bars
and admitted iour more attacnesâ two for
the San Francisco delezation and two for
the Democratic minority. There was
slight opposition on the part of the Demo
cratic minority until a .Republican sng
gestion came that the Democrats were not
forced to accept the two attaches provided
for them.
Speaker Coombs wil appoint all the
lawyers in the Assembly to the Judiciary
Committee. A canvas has developed the
fact that the Republican lawyers outnum
ber the legal lights of the opposition.
Both houses of the Legislature will.
probably adjourn to-morrow until Mon
day. Speaker Coombs may announce
several of the standing committees this
week, but the main list will not be pro
mulÃated until next Monday.
One of the peculiar bills introduced to
day and referred to the Public Health and
Quarantine Committee provides as fol
lows:
"Should one or both eyes of an infant
become reddened or inflamed at any time
within two weeks after birtta, it shall be
the duty of the midwife, nurse or person
havinfltcharge of said infant to report the
conditron of the eyes at once to some legal
practitioner of medicine of the city, town
or district in which the parents of the in
fant reside."
A fine of $100, or imprisonment six
months, is ihe penalty prescribed for vio
lation of the proposed law.
The bill may be amended in committee
requiring Speaker Coombs to report red
eyed members of the Assembly to the
Board of Health.

Hubbard and Bell Say the Roads
Should Not Be Permitted to
Dodge Their Debts
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 7. â The
debate upon the proposition to refund the
indebtedness of the Pacific railroad com
panies to the Government was begun in
the House to-day under an order adopted
last month, which set apart the rest of
this week for that purpose. Preliminary
thereto an immense wall map showing
the routes of the road was elevated in
front of the Speaker's desk to aid tbe
members in arriving at & clear under
standing of tbe question. Interest in the
debate was neither deep nor extensive.
Before entering on the execution of the
day's order a bill was agreed to providing
for the appointment of a Surveyor-General
for Alasfca at a salury of $2000.
The Speaker laid before tbe House the
notice from Governor Morton of New
York of the resignation of Frank S. Black
as a Representative in Congress from that
State, he having been elected Governor to
succeed Mr. Morton.
When the House went into the commit
tee of the whole Payne (R.) of New York
was called to the chair. Powers (R. ) of
Vermont, chairman of the Committee on
Pacific Railroads, reportine the bill,
stated that the time for general debate
was to be equally divided between friends
and opponents of the measure and to be
controlled by himself and Hubbnrd (R.)
of Missouri, which arrangement was con
firmed by tne committe, and Powers
opened the case for the bill. He said it
was a plain business proposition that the
committee had reported, and it was in
tended to appeal only to the good busi
ness sense of the House.
lie iirst addressed himself to a history
of the Pacific railroad enterprises and the
legislation in reference thereto, which had
its beginning in the act of July 1, 1862. It
had its origin in the consideration by the !
Gjvernment of the necessity of such a '
work in order to hold tlie States of the Pa
citic Coast to their allegiance to the Union.
By the act referred to the projectors of the
scheme of the construction of a line of
railroad from the Miisouri to the Sacra
mento River, in California, were given
such aid as enabled them to pusu forward
the eiant enterprise and finally to see the
full fruiiton of their hopes in the accom
plishment of the task. This aid was of
two finds â a land grant and a bond sub
m<lvâihe latter ranging from $16,000 a
mile on level ground to $32,000 a mile on
tenitcry lying between the Rocky and
Cascade ranges of mountains, and to
$48,000 a mile over the mountains proper.
.Although itnow seemed comparatively
an easy thing, said Power?, to construct
a Pacific railroad, in 1862 it was deemed
to be a gigantic enterprise, chimeiical in
its nature and prospects, and private capi
tal could not be enlisted in its support
under the provisions of the act of 1562.
8o in 18*34 Congress waived its first lien
upon ihe property in favor of the holders
of bonds issued and sold by the compa- j
nies to secure the money with which to !
prosecute the enterprise. These two acts
contained the charters of the Pacific rail
roads. But the Supreme Court had de
cided that the lien of the Government
affected only those lines of the com panic* j
â which had actually been aided by bonds j
or lands.
The consequence of this decision was
greatly to reduce tne value of the security.
Further, the line of the Union Pacific
Railroad, owing to the controversy among i
cities on the Missouri River for the privi- !
lepe of beine the eastern terminus, was !
be^un at the one hundredth meridian of
longituie, with branc es to Omaha and
Kansas City. The eff-.-ct of this legislation !
was to take the terminals at these two '
places from under the Government lien. '
The Union and Central companies then
entered into a strugg'e of construction to
secure the largest possiole land grant and
bond Hubsidy. This race of diligence led
to a duplication of nearly eighty miles of
real at the point of connection, and the
question of the junction point hail to be
settled by Congress. This enabled the ]
two companies to construct the entire I
length of road to the acceptance of tl;e â 
Government by the lOtri of May, 1869, four
years after the first spadeful of earth had
been thrown and more than six years
beforo the expiration of the limit within
which it mi^m complete the work,
Tiie benefits accruing to the Government
and to the people from the construction
of the roads were graphically sketched by
Powers. If the Government should de
sire every dollar it had advanced to the
companies, it could credit itself with ten
times as much in tha material advance
ment and progress and development
which had resulted to the country from '
tne opening of the territory.
'â¢Why." he said, "if it had not been for
the building of these railroads we should
never have heard of a silver party. But
(reflectively) I don't think tnat is any
argument in favor of the passage of me
bill." [Laughter]
One of the provisions of the charter act
was that the companies should pay into
the United States treasury 5 percent of
the net earnings as a sinking fund to meet
the bonds issued by the Government, to
gether with all transportation charges
against the Government. In 1864 it was
enacted that only half the transportation
charges should be retained. Later the
Supreme Court decided that the com
panies could not be compelled to pay the
interest on tbe bonds until the principal
became due, and therefore the accumula
tion of debt.

the hope and expectation that it would
secure the repayment of the Government's
debt, but the reasons which operated to
prevent the successful working of the
ulan for repayment of the debt proposed
in the charter acts prevailed to set at
naught the scheme so elaborately wrought
by Senator Thurman. They were the
division of the Government's business be
tween the existing lines instead of giving
it ell to the line which it should nourish
and encourage.
Boatner (D. ) of Louisiana asked Powers
if he maintained that the companies had
paid all to the Government that an
honest and capable management would
have pemitted them to do.
Powers replied that he did. He de
clared his own opinion to be that the rail
road companies had discharged every
oDligation imposed on them by the
Government; they had fulfilled every
contract made by Congress.
Turning from the historical to the ac
tual features of the case Powers said that
on the Ist of July next, to which date the
bill wao to apply, the Central Pacific
would owe the Government $57,904,177
and the Union Pacific 153,289,593. Some
of the bonds were overduj and the ques
tion before Congress was what was best to
be done. Should the Government fore
close the mortgage which meant long liti
gation and an increase of the debt of the
Government by between sixty and seventy
millions to pay off the underlying first
mortgage in order to enter upon the very
doubtful experiment of operating tho road
upon Government account? The wiser
method would be for the creditor to deter
mine the debt-paying ability of his debtor
and make a settlement with him on that
basis. That was what the bill proposed to
do.
A'ked why the committee had increased
the first mortgage of the Central Pacific
by about $21,000,000 and that of the Union
Pacific by about $23,000,000, Powers replied
that it was because the Government got
$2 for $1 of additional security.
If Congress s..ou;d seize the roads or
undertake to foreclose the mortgage by
judicial process and sale, it would find
itself in possession of a line without ter
minals or branch roads to give it busi
ness, or would force a sale at which no one
except the man now being criticized
could afford to buy. The principal ad
vantage to be gained by the Government
was that it gained a second mortgage on
the entire property of the roads, whereas
it now bad a lien only upon a link of
the road. The railroad company would
be permitted to make a first mortgage
upon the property equal to the face of the
existing first mortgages. The Govern
ment mortgage was to be extended at 2
per cent.
Falrchild of New York asked as to
the identity of the men who were bene
fited or affected by the bill; whether or
not the Central and Union Pacific com
panies were composed of practically the
same individuals.
Powers replied that the individuals
were the same. He further stated that
the bill was not acceptable to the corpora
tions.
Maguire (D.) of Californiaâ All they
have-to do is to reject then.
Powersâ There is no certainty that the
companies will take it. We have to force
the pill down them.
To Smith (R.) of Michigan Powers said
he knew of no diversion of traffic from
the Union Pacific road which ought to
have been retained by or for it. Trie state
ment would be made in the course of the
debate that the Southern Pacific, upon
whose property tbe Government held
notes and could not have a lien, absorbed
the revenues of the Central Pacific He
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 1897.
would not stop now, he said, to demon
strate tbat that assertion was untrue, but
would so state to-morrow.
Lacey ( K. ) of lowa asked why a divi
dend of 4 per cert was allowed on the stock
when the Government was to get but 2
pei- cent for its bonds, which were ahead
ol the stock.
"tsecause," rei)lied Powers, "we want
the stockholders to undertake this obliga
tion and they won't do it unless they are
assured of a reasonable return upon their
money."
At present, Powers said, Central Pacific
stock was quoted at about 15 and Union
Pacific was worth nothing. The reorgani
zation committee had issued certificates
to stockholders liable to an assessment of
$15 a share which had been quoted at
about 10. The committee had endeavored
to make the rate of interest to the Govern
ment at 3 per cent, but had been com
pelled to Si the rate at 2 per cent. The
committees believed that the companies
could comply with the requirements of
the bill. The Central Pacific would have
to pny $3,825,000 per year, fixed charges;
the Union Pacfic $3,628,000 a year. Upon
I the basis of the earnings of the companies
for a period of years past it was estimated
that they could be depended upon to earn
a net revenue of $4,000,000 a year. In
deed, it was inconceivable that the roads
could ever again pass through such a
period of depression as they have for the
past three years.
Asked what estimate the committee
placed upon the additional property to be
brought within the new mortgage Pow
ers said it was difficult to state. A
Senate committee in 1890 fixed the value
at $92,000,000. The division superintend
ent of the road said that the Denver ter
minals alone could not be duplicated for
less than $10,000,000. while the Union Pa
| cific's coal lands were estimated to be
worth as much as the total amount of the
Government debt.
To Perkins (R.) of lowa Powers stated
that the pending bill did not include with
in its provisions the Sioux City and Pacific
or tho central branch in Kansas, neither
of which was a part of the Union Pacific.
In conclusion Powers said the commit
tee, in its conclusions embodied in the
bill, was entirely in harmony with the
recommendations of the Kail way Commit
tee. The House had no business with the
quarrels between the Central Pacific and
Mayor Sutro of Ran Francisco. Its busi
ness was to provide for the payment of
j a debt due the Governmentâ a plan for
doing that the committee submitted to
the good sense of tue members.
The attack on the bill v/as opened by
Hubbard (R.)of Missouri, who prepared
the views of the minority of the commit
tee. He said that, following Powers' his
tory of the legislation relating to the
Union and Central Pacific roads, he de
sired to call the attention of the commit
tee to the provision of the law of 1862,
which required that all the capital stock
of the corporations should be paid in
cash. The facts were tbat the Union Pa
cific was capitalized at $60,800,000, of
which but 16 per cent was paid in ; the Cen
tral Pacific at $68,000,000, of which 10 per
cent was paid in; the Western Pacific at
$7,900,000, of which 2% per cent was paid
in, and the Kansas Pacific at $9,600,000, of
which not a cent was paid in. In the
construction of the Union and Central
Pacific roads, Hubbard stated, there ac
crued to those in charge a profit of sixty
two millions; and there had been paid
in dividends on the Union Pacific, includ
ing the Kansas Pacific, $28,000,000.
"I do not state these facts," said Hub
bard, "in any sense of antagonism to the
gentlemen who received these profits and
dividends. If they fcave violated any law
NEW TO-DAYâ CLOTHING.
1 the proper officers will attend to them; if
they have pail the Government fairly and
in accordance with law neither you nor I
have any reason to complain."
Hubbard reviewed Powers* assertion
that the companies could carry out the
provisions of the committee's bill. From
the statements made to the committee by
Mr. Tweed and the report of the United
States Commissioner of Railroads Hub
bard showed that instead of the company
earning about 14,000,000 a year net it ran
in debt to the amount of nearly $1,000,000
on the operations of 1895, while for the
previous few years the net earnings had
not exceeded $2,144,000, in 1891, which was
a phenomenal year. On the other band
Poor's Manual, a railroad authority, gave
the net earnings at about the figures given
by Powers, and, analyzing the report of
the. Railroad- Commissioners, Hubbard
reached the conclusion that the Central
Pacific did earn about $4,000,000 net over
and above operating expenses and taxes.
The other expenditure's tabulated by the
Railroad Commissioner either needed ex
planation or were to be offset by items not
considered. The bill of the committee was
satisfactory to the railroad officials, the
assertion of the gentleman from Vermont
(Powers) to the contrary notwithstanding.
In this connection Hubbard related at
some length the various propositions for
the settlement of the debt, in support of
his claim that the provisions cf the pend
ing bill ware not the best offers made by
the companies. â 
; He gave it is his opinion that the cor
porations were financially able to do bet
ter than the bill had proposed and that
the Union Pacific was much stronger than
the Central Pacific. The proposition con
tained in the bill was not so good for the
Government as the requirement of the
present law. The Union Pacific was now
paying $1.500, C00 a year. By the terms of
the bill its payments would amount to but
$1,350,000 a year, running over a period of
eighty-three years. It was useless to ex
pect any one to raise the money required
by. the Dill to make it effective. The prob
abilities of the future were too uncertain
to make the security of the Government
stable. It depended altogether upon the
indissolubility of the tie between the Cen

failure of one or the other in the future,
and that could easily be brought about,
would absolutely destroy the security of
the Government under the pending bill.
The fatal point in the bill was the failure

property of both lines from the Missouri
River to the; Pacific, Ocean. That ought

consolidation or combination of the two i
roads Hubbard asserted that the mortgage
of the Government did extend over the
terminals of the Union Pacific, including
the Omaha bridge, the Supreme Court
having decided in the case of Hall versus
the railroad company that the Union Pa
cific began at Council Bluffs and ended at
a point five miles west of Ogden, Utah.
This, he said, overthrew the position of
Powers and those who held with him.
Hubbard went with much detail into
?o<ne of the mortgage transactions of the
Union Pacific Company, which he said
showed some strange things. It might
be that they were intended to hide or
rover up something, but he could not
assert it, for it was almost practically im
possible to get information regarding the
operations.
They did give weight to the charge that
the company was arranging to settle with
the company. Powers, he said, had been
asked a pertinent question as to why the
bill did not require the Union Pacific
Company to mortgage its bonds, stocks
and other securities as it did require the
Central Pacific to do, and he had re
sponded that the requirements upon the j
two companies were the same. Hubbard
denied that statement. The bill required
the Central Pacific only to mortgage its
bonds and stocks. As a matter of fact, it
never did have a dollar of such securities
in its Dossession, while the Union Pacific,
holding about $90,000,000 of these securi
ties, is absolved from pledging them to
the G6vernment. The bill would not re
sult in any practical benefit to the Govern
ment. It would simply extend for eighty
three years the period within which the
companies could escape paying their
debts.
Bell (D.) of Texas, who also printed
some views dissenting from the report of
the committee, followed in opposition to
the bill. He said the stockholders of these
corporations were not in a position to
come to Congress and ask for any consid
eration whatever, much less ask the
granting of such important concessions.
He Knew that there was no one in the
United States who believed that tne men
who built the railroads and were now
stockholders had dealt fairly or honestly
with the Government. Every proposition
looking to the establishment of a sinking
fund had been defeated by one means or
another.
After the Thurman act was enacted the
Central Pacific was leased to the Southern
Pacific, to that there was no 25 per cent
of net earnings left to pay Into the treas
ury.- The roads had not been operated so
as to make money for the owners, ami
therefore it was safe to assume that the
corporations were insolvent and unable
to pay their debts. He thought it was
preposterous to propose such a settlement
as that provided in toe bill. The Govern
ment was asked to practically give them
the use of 3 per cent upon the total debt
of 1112,000,000, the roads not being re
quired to do a thing in return.
"Oh, no," said Bell; "if the companies
want any such favor as asked for let them
go down into their pockets, sell some of
the ill-gotten gains, securities arid other
property and make the Government se
cure and then we will treat with them."
[Applause].
Bell doubted the statement that the ad
ditional security io be itiven the Govern
ment under the bill for increasing the face
of the mortgages was snlHcient reason for
making the increase. One of ti.e items
was the land grant still unsold. The
lands were assessed at $3 an acre, but they
had been offered for sale for years at that
figure or Jess without finding purchasers.
The security offered for the Central Pa
cific debt, that of the Southern Pacific
Railroad of Kentucky, Bell said, was far
from satisfactory. It had little or no
property, ne understood, and it was no
improbable thing to anticipate that the
company, finding itself burdened with the
proposed liability, would simply drop out
and be succeeded by some other corpora
tion not bound by the bill.
The accumulation of wealth by the pro
jectors of these enterprises and the owners,
Bell vehemently asserted, was a matter
of interest to the public, and he denied
the statement of the gentleman from Ver
mont that it was none of the public's
business.
"If a man by watering the stock and
adding to the burdens of the people gains
great richness, he is an enemy to the pub
lic, and ought to have no friend stand up
here for him, ana has no right to come to
Congress and ask for great and substantial
benefits." [Applause.]
The matter, however, was a business
one purely, Bell said, as had been stated
by Powers. There were three propositions
under consideration. One was to take the
roads under the mortgage and operate
them. This he found objectionable, as he
did aho the second, which was to sell the
property and pocket the loss if sny oc
curred. He particularly opposed the idea
of (government ownership or operation of
railroads; aud if the Government was
going into that business he did not want
to experiment with these roads in a thinly
populated part of the country. He re
pudiated so much of the language of the
act of 1862 as imputed to Congress an as
sumption of the doctrine of ownership.
[Applause.]
The third proposition was one he recom
mended as an amendment of the commit
tee's billâ to extend theindebtedness of the
companies for a reasonable period at 3
per cent interest, the corporations to give
the Government a first mortgage instead
of a second.
Grow (R.) of Pennsylvania addressed
himself briefly to the proposition ad
vanced by Bell, declaring it impractical.
The committee then rose and Bell pre
sented a substitute for the committee
bill, in accordance with the plan outlined
in his remarks, and it was ordered
printed.
A substitute was also presented by Har
rison (D.) of Alabama, also to be printed.
At 5:10 o'clock the House adjourned
unul to-morrow.

They Think the fewer* Bill Will Be
llratm in the Houite.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 7.âMem
bers of the California delegation are hope
ful that the Powers refunding bill will be
beaten in the House. The sentiment of
the House seems to be adverse to the bill.
The speakers opposed to the refunding
bill were heartily applauded to-day, while
those who advocated the bill were given a
"frost."
Judge Maguire said to The Call corre
spondent to-night: "The indications are
encouraging, and although the railroad
people are claiming that they will pass
the bill Ido not believe it. I think that
to-day's proceedings demonstrated that a
majority of the members present in the
House of Representatives sympathized
with the opposition."
Representative Blue of Kansas, one of
the ablest and most influential Represen
tatives, said to-ni-iht: "I have not given
the question the consideration which I
will Rive it before voting, but I believe the
bill will be beaten in the House. The
Government ought to do something with
this matter. Ie seems to me that the pass
age of this bill will be temporizing with
the question. It will have to be handled
later." 'i
i Representative Tracey said: "I don't
thiuk this bill will become a law."
The letter of Secretary Carlisle to the
Senate yesterday, declaring that a certain
statement of the account against the Pn
cific railroads could not be found, was
commented upon freely by some of the
Senators to-day. The information was
requested in a Senate resolution, and now
that the Treasury Department cannot fur
nish the figures desired the Interior De
partment will be called upon.
Regarding the alleged disappearance of
Government accounts against the rail
roads, Senator Morg&n this afternoon
said that the whole thing was very sur
prising to him. He had never heard, he
said, of such a thing as a secretary of a
department being unable to find accounts
on file. He said that if the full facts
about the matter could be ascertained
he would certainly attempt to find them
out.
Senator Pettigrew said that in 1876 the
amount due the Government in this par
ticular was $1,700,000, and that it had
probably swelled to $4,000,000 by now. He
also proposes to investigate the matter
thoroughly and to do all l:c can to probe
it to the bottom.

WOOLEN RUBBISH
HARD T0 BEAT
American Factories Forced
to Compete With For

They Must Have a Reasonable
Wool Tariff or Cose Up
the Mills.
Important Facts in the Wool Industry
G yen to the House Ways
and Means Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 7. -The
wool manufacturers were well represented
before the Ways and Means Committee to
day.
S. N. North of Boston, secretary of the
National Association, presented the views
of that body. Ho said the association
conn- moderation in fixing rates and
expected only adequate protection such as
experience had proven was necessary to
enable them to continue and extend the
industry. They desired a chance to reopen
their mills; but they neither asked nor
desired excessive duties, -being' convinced
that tho best interests of both the wool
crowing and wool-manufacturing interests
would be protected by the enactment of a
conservative and reasonable tariff and
that some promise of permanence would
thus exist.
At the present moment there was more
machinery in operation than during the
summer, but the general condition of the
manufacturer was as bad as bad could be.
The manufacturers were not so blind as
to attribute the whole of their prolonged
paralysis to the tariff revision of 1894;
other causes had beÂ«jn at work, and all in
dustries had suffered. Eut there must
have been a special cause why the wool
manufacturer had suffered far more than
any other, and why the prospect of a gen
eral business revival brought no promise
of any improvement of this particular in
dustry. The special cause was revealed in
the records of woolen imports, a table of
which be presented.
In the anajysi* of the table Mr. North
invited attention first to quantities. The
imports of clotha in the year 1895 ran up
to 40,070,000 pounds, almost equal to the
entire imports for the years 1891, LB92aad
under the act of 1800. The largest
quantity of cloths imported in one year
previously was 16,243,313 pounds in 1892,
and the increase in 1896 over the largest
previous year was 147 percent The total
imports of manufactures of wool in IBM
were valued â or undervalued â at $(>0,31!V
301, foreign valuation. The duty paid
value of these goods was about $!H),000,000.
The value of the domestic product in 1890,
as shown by the census returns, was about
$-'..0,i'00,000.
in otner words the duty paid value of
the imports of 1595 was about one-third
of all woolens made in American mills in
a year of manufacturing activity, sucn as
1890 was. They were equal to about one
i^alf of the domestic production of 1186,
American millers could supply all the
coeds the American people could consume.
The enormous importations at low valua
tions crowded upon a sluggish market
were what broke down the domestic man
ufacturers. The foreigners so completely
overdid the business that they had sui
fered from the reaction, the importations
having largely fallen off since about Feb
ruary last, being to day comparatively
small.
The ad valorem basis of the tariff had
allowed the importation of the lowest and
meanest descriptions of goods made in
the worldâ the peculiar products of the
Battley and Dewsbury districts in Eng
land, where they had reduced to an ex?
act science the businessof making woolens
out of shoddy, muntro waste, cows' bair
and other "rubbish," ia the spinning and
weaving of which the American manufac
turers had not learned tha rudiment?,
although it was clear they would have to
learn them if they must compete with
this class of goods in the market. The
complaint of domestic manufacturers, in
a word, was mat the higher &rade of
American goods had been compelled to
compete for their own market at prices
fixed and governed by these worthless
cioihÂ«.
Another difficulty not less serious
sprung primarily trom the same cause â
the ad valorem duty. Not only had mar
ket values been demoralized in the man
ner indicated, but they had been further
obliterated by the systematic consign
ment of goods at prices lower than me
cost of manufacture abroad, and their sale
in this country, duty paid, at less than the
cost of manufacture here. He complained
of the form in which the duties were
assessed and of the manner in which they
were collected.
He objected also to the dividing lines in
the levying of an ad valorem duty and
particularly to the dividing r lines in the
present" tariff at SO cents a pound, which
had been ingeniously thrust into the law
at what had proved to be a dancer point
in the present market conditions to invite
and tempt importers to save 10 per cent in
these duties by an under valuation. which,
in many instances, need not exceed 2 or 3
cents per pound. The manufacturer.-, he
said, did not resist the restoration of the
wool duties. They affirmatively favored
a reasonable duty on wool because they
believed in the policy of protection and
were willing to make a sacrifice in order
that that policy mieht be applied to ail
products which needed it. .
Thomas Sampson, who operates a small
mill in Rhode island, stated to the com
mittee that if the conditions of the past
few years continue all the wool&n-mills of
the country must close.
8. Muihauser of Cleveland,' Ohio, a large
maker of shoddy, said i c used the cuttings
and waste material of wool and woolen
mills. He supplied all the large manufac
turers with shoddy, which they use.i for
backing. They bad to use this product to
compete with" foreign cloth. The better
class of his output contained].;?}, per cent
of wool. t
He used foreign rags because they were
better sorted and cleaned, but in prosper
ous time* he had consumed principally
the cuttings of tailor-shops and mills. At
present his mill, which employed some
700 handÂ«, was closed. He would not ob
ject to a 2-cent rate on rajrvwÃich, accord
ing to the present importations," would
yield a revenue of $430,000 per annum.
K. Rinks of New York, in speaking for
the makers of woolen bats, called atten
tion to the injustice under the present
law of classifying woolen hats with blan
kets or the lower grades of wools.
W. H. Brown of Philadelphia, repre
senting a number of woolen manufactur
ers of that i city, asked that they be given
the same consideration as was given the
worsted manufacturers. .
G. C Moses of Maine said that what all
manufacturers wanted was a tariff of such
a moderate nature thai it would not be
upset in a few years. The change from
the McKiuley to the Wilson bill had cost
his company. $100,000. . .
Robert Stunt* of New York, a mat and
rug maker, appealed for protection for
his comparatively new industry against
the cheap labor competition of Germany.
The rait lee adjourned until to

NOT SO SUSPICIOUS.
Recent Discoveries Indicate That Ham
mond's Foreign "Exchange Entry Is
All Right After All.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 7.â Second Vice-
Preaident Hammond's much- discussed
entry of "foreign exchange, $900,000." may
be made clear in a remarkable manner.
That the entry was proper and absolutely
straightforward is also likely to be shown.
A case now pending in the Federal
courts apparently holds the key to tbe
oystery that descended as a shadow on
the Illinois National Bank oilicial who
took his life a few days ago.
The caÃe promises to be cleared up by
the recent discovery of some papers
which disappeared from the office of
Colonel W. V. Jacobs a long time ago.
Jacobs has sued his former bookkeeper
and confidential man for an accounting^
of money and papers traced into his'
hands, but of which his books show no
record. Fac-similes of some of the miss
ing papers recently found their way into
print, and Jacobs and his attorney hope
by this means to clear up some of tbe
points at issue.
In themselves the papers have-no value,
v they relate to transactions dating back
to 1893 and long since closed. The papers
relate to loans made by the National Bank
of Illinois early in the life of the Calumet
Electric Railroad, wiien Jacobs was its
solo owner, and show that the National
Bank of Illinois, instead of using its own
resources, borrowed the money for Jacobs
abroad. Such a transaction involved
nothing illegitimate on the part of the
bank until, as afterward developed when
the bank was forced to take control of the
road, these loans became larger than tbe
National banking laws allowed.
Hammond's entry of "foreign ex
change, $900,000," according to tho Jacobs
case, was not, therefore, made to conceal
any improper transactions, but was the
proper entry to niako concerning money
advanced to the Calumet Electric Rail
way. Money was to come from abroad to
cover the loan made, but later, when the
bank took charge of the road, it was, of
course, obliged to assume the loan made
earlier in the life of the corporation.

Negroes on Inauguration

BOSTON, Mass;., Jan. 7.â Troubles mul
tiply for Isaac B. Allen, colored, a mem
ber of Governor Wolcjtt's council of 1897.
Yesterday ie waa discovered that thou
sands of invitations, sisnpcl witn Allen's

TROUBLE OVKR BOSDS.
Arizona Officials Timid About. Obey ing
a Congressional Act. -. '
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 7. -The re
fusal of the officials of Arizona Territory
to exchange Territorial bonds for Pima
County bonds to the . amount of $300,000
as was provided for by contract when the
county bonds were sold, and whiGb ex
change was subsequently expressly au
thorized and provided for by an act of
Congress, has aroused the indignation of
some of the holders of such county bonds,
including Mrs. Elizabeth B. Voorhees of
this city and James Utter of Oak Hill,
N. Y. These holders, through their agent,
now in Arizona, have given notice to the
loan commission of that Territory that
unless the exchange of bonds is made
forthwith they will apply to the Supreme
Court of the Territory ior a mandamus to
compel theexchanee.
In the ollicc of W. M. Coller <fc Co., who
have acted for the bondholders in the
matter, it was said yesterday that the firm
.was surprised that the exchange of bonds
had not been made, as they Knew ot no
reason frr the refusal. u:ile>s it was that
I some oiticiai of the Territory was afraid
to act without the direct sanction of the
> court, and that this may have caused the
agent to take the step contemplated.
There was certainly no serious legal
trouble, it was declared, and holders of
such Fima Conntv bonds had nothing to
I fear, beyond n Miort delay. In the mean-
I time the county bonds were drawing 7
! per cent interest, whereas the Territorial
bonds will oraw only 5 per cent.

LADY SCOTT WEPT
AND CONFESSED
A Sensation Terminates the
Earl Russell Libel
Case.
Jury Finds Defendants Guilty
and They Will Be Sen
tenced To-Day.
A Nasty English Case Which At
tracted the Attention of the
Entire Nobility.
LONDON, Eno., Jan. 7.â The libel snit
brought by Earl Russell against his
mother-in-law, Lady Scott, and two male
defendants, John Cockerton, an engineer,
and William Aylott, a valet, came to a
most sensational ending to-day when the
defendants pleaded guilty. The case has
been exceedingly nasty in character, but
involved people of such hijrh rank that it
has attracted wide attention, and the
court has been crowded at every session
with those enger to hear the testimony
against the Earl.
As the case progressed, however, it be
came evident that the defense was a very
weak one. The defendants did rot deny
making the assertions complained of. but
claimed that the statements concerning
the Earl's misconduct were true. The evi
dence they introduced, however, failed to
sustain the charges.
Yesterday the court was crowded, as it
was known that counsel for the defense
was to sum up. The counsel contended
that Lady Scott's whole ODject was simply
to vindicate her daughter and defend the
latter from her husband's attacks.
The counsel for Lady Scott, continuing,
said the defendant still believed tbe state
ments made by the male defendants were
true, and he scouted the idea that narra
tives were invented, pointing out the
progressive step of Earl Russell's career
at Oxford, the incidents of 1887, claiming
they strongly tended to confirm the stories
of indecency.
During the latter portion oi the sum
ming up of the counsel for the defenae
Lady Scott burst into tears, and counsel at
the close of his remarKs was applauded,
after which tin case was adjourned lorthe
day.
This morning the courtroom was, if pos
sible, more crowdod than yesterday, and
the spectators were rewarded with the sen
sation that they nad been expecting since
the first days of the trial. When the court
had been opened for business and tbe pris
oners had been brought in Solicitor Wal
ton arose and announced that under the
advice of counsel tbe defendants withdrew
the plea of justification in uttering libels
complained of by Earl Russell and pleaded
guilty as charged. The announcement
created a profound sensation.
Lady Scott wa3 in a hignly excited,
almost hysterical condition, and aeemeaat
times as if she were about to faint. The
other defendants, Aylott and Cockerton,
maintained an air of unconcern.
Under the circumstances there was no
need for further trial. The jury rendered
a formal verdict of guilty, and the
Court announced that sentences would
be imposed to-morrow. What the sen
tences will be is a matter of much
discussion and surmise. It is generally
believed that Lady Scott's action was
based on a destre to take her daughter's
part, and that sue was really deceived by
the male defendants. If the court takes
this view her sentence will probably be a
light one. Tie punishment of the two
men will doubtless be more severe.
The present case grew out of an equally
sensational and even more disgusting case
brought in 1891, when Countess Russell,
daughter of Lady Scott, sued for a divorce
lrom Earl Russell, making accusations
against her husband of a most revolting
character. The case was bitterly con
tested, and attracted great attention. It
ended in the failure of the Countess to
prove her charges and a denial of the di
vorce asked. Subsequently the Earl ap
plied for a divorce and was granted it
At the trial Lady Scott and the two other
defendants in the present case made the
most damaging kind of statements con
cerning the conduct of the Earl, and it
was these statements that led to the pres
ent libel suit.
WILLIS VERY ILL
His Condition Sightly Improvedâ Minister
Cooper's Report at Home on
Annexation.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Dec. ' 30. - -The
many friends of United States Minister
Willis will be pained to hear that he con
tinues in a very critical condition. The
attack of pneumonia, from which he suf
fered in California, has led to other com
plications. All that skilled physicians
and nurses can do is btiug done. It is
hoped that he has vitality needful to resist
further inroads on his strength. Hono
lulu society misses the social functions
which Minister and Mrs. Willis have made
so pleasant to all re>idents and visitors.
The condition of Mr. Willis is improv
ing, but the change is coming very slowly
indeed. He is ty no means able to sit up
and read papers The Minister cannot
yet receive callers and even at the present
favorable rate of recovery it will be some
time before he will be permitted by his
physicians to do anything at all.
President Dole has issued invitations for
a New Year's reception, and it will be the
event of the Cay. The Christmas season
was very pleasant.
In an interview published by the Ha
waiian Star after his return from his re
cent visit to the United States Minister
Cooper said his conviction is that there
wou.d be a determination ot the annex.i-
tion question within a year, and that he
regarded the prospects for an alliance as
excellent. All of the old friends are sii 1

ORGANIZED FORGERY.
A Gang of Fire Young Men Raise $10,
--000 by Signing Names of
Chicago Millionaires.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 7.â Five young
men, who by their confessions organized
into a band for the purpose of obtaining
money through forging the names of Chi
cauo millionaires to bank checks, are
under arrest at the Woodlawn police sta
tion. The police have positive knowledge
that they nave succeeded in obtaining
nearly $10,000. They were caught only
after two months of hard police search,
and only because a bank cashier discov
ered that an unusually clever signature
to a check for $260 was a foreery. The
prisoners are: Arthur L. Foreman, alias
Howard E. Stone, confessed forger and
leader of the gang; Elmer Russell; Ed
ward L. Root, alias O'Rourke, check
passer; Charles McEwen and William
Bert. A sixth member of the gang, whose
name is supposed to be Paul Morau, es-
caped.
The plan consisted in securing the sig
nature of a victim and then forging it at
leisure. A lorged check bearing tnename
of G. F. Swift, and drawn for $1200. was
cashed by the National Livestock Bank
at the stock yards, while other cheeks,
ranging from $2500 to $3000, have been suc
cessfully passed on other banks with the
signature of H. W. Eiskopf & Co., whose
wholesale grocery establishment is at 3510
Vincennes avenue.
The matter got into the* hands of the
police, and their work yesterday resulted
in tLe five arrests. Captain Snippy se
cured confessions from Foreman and
Root. Captain Snippy secured a key from
Foreman to a safety deposit vault, and
yesterday he found there numerous checks
bearing forged signatures, but with no
amounts filed in. Upon these checks were
the names of F. N. Higginbothnm, Charles
J. Reid of the firm of Reid, Murdoch &
Co., Frost Bros, and others.
Other incriminating evidence was se
cured, and papers indicating that the
forger band had secured $8000 or $10,000
in its operations, which are said to have
boen going on for a year.
Little is known of the identity of the
prisoners, except as they have confessed
to these recent operations.
PAYING OUT GOLD.
Government Paying Out the Yellow Metal
and Taking in the White â Green
backs Nearly Gone.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan 7.â Tne dis
bursements oi the treasury this month
have made such inroads on tbe supply of
greenbacks on hand that the Government
has been compelled to resume paying out
treasury notes at all the sub-treasuries,
and it is likely that its supply of that
form of money will still further decrease.
An interesting feature about the situa
tion is that while the treasury is paying
out millions of dollars of notes that are
redeemable again by the Government in
gold, the treasury is receiving only silver
(certificates) in payment of customs du
ties. In other words, while discharging
its own obligations in gold, the Govern
ment is compelled to receive, and is re
ceiving, only silver for customs duties,
taxes, etc.
HARTFORD, Jan. 7.â Albert H. Walker
of this city made public last night, by per
mission of Senator John Sherman, a let
ter he received from the Senator early in
December last, giving the Senator's views
on tbe retirement of greenbacks. The let
ter is:
Washington, Dec. 3, 1896.
Albert H. Walkerâ Dear bir: Your kind note
of the 28tn ult. received. Ido not sympathize
with the movement proposed to retire United
States votes from circulation. I believe it is
easy to maintain a limited amount of tnese in
circulation without danger or difficulty. The
maintenance in circulation of $246,000,000
United States notes supported by a reserve of
$100,000,000 goid not only saves the interest
on $246,000,000 of debt, but is a vast con
venience to the people at large. The best
form of paper money is that which is backed
by the Government and maintaiued at the
specie standard. Tbe absolute security of
these notes was never called in question nfter
the resumption of specie payment in 1879,
until the reserve was being trenched upon to
meet the difficulties brought about by what is
known as the Wilson tariff law of 1804. Very
truly yours, John Sherman.
Danger -From flood* Over.
ST. LOUIS. Mo., Jan. 7â The river rose
but three inches during the last night, and
this afternoon it was stationary. The
danger of damage from floods is believed
to be over. There is no ice in the river,
and the boats are runnine to Southern
ports. No further reports of distress have
reached this city from the flooded districts
rear Louisiana, Mo., and it is believed
that all the woodclioppers and their
families are safe. Reports from South
western Missouri show the flood to be
subsiding.

JAPAN'S FOREIGN
POLICY DEFINED
Important Speeches of the
New Minister, Count
Okuma.
Mrs. Carew's Trial Promises to
Be One of the Most Sen
sational on Record.
Barbarous Executions by the Court
of Korea â Chinese Rcughs Tor
ture a Catholic Priest
TOKIO, Japan, Dec. 22.â The Minister
of Foreign Affairs, Count Okuma, has de
livered several important speeches since
he came into office. His policy, as defined
in these utterances, may be briefly
summed up thus: An attitude of grateful
friendship toward western powers; an at
titude of sympathy and helpfulness to
ward China, and an attitude of watchful j
readiness toward Korea. The Count is |
very outspoken about the i!!-behavior of
his nationals in Korea and about the ad
ministrative blunders committed in For*
mosa.
The trial of Mrs. W. R. H. Carew, for
the willful murder of her husband by
poisoning, is set to commence on January
4, in her Britannic Majesty's Court at
Yokohama. Crown Advocate H. S. Wil
kinson has come from Shanghai to assist
the Yokohama Crown Prosecutor, H. C.
Lltchfield, in conducting the prosecution.
Sixty British residents of Yokohama have
been summoned for the jury. Five only
will be actually needed, bat counsel on
both sides are expected to exercise great
discrimination. The case promises to be
one of the most sensational on record.
The Korean correspondents of theTokio [
papers state that Ku Sou Chang, an ex
police inspector of the court, arrested
some days ago with several other Ko
reans, was hanged on the 4th inst. at the
instance of the Police Bureau. Five or
six others are said to have met a similar
fate on the same day, but this story.re
quires confirmation. The cruelty of the
Korean court, in utter defiance of justice
and humanity, shows how complete is its
relapse into its old lawless ways. The
above executions must have been perpe
trated by An Hwan, who seems to be a i
bloody ruffian, taking a delight in the
horrible business of murdering his fellow
countrymen.. Indeed, An is reported to
have been much disappointed at finding
no more victims to ba dispatched, for he
failed even by torture to extort incrimi
nating evidence from other prisoners.
The Government takes care not to inform
the public of the number of arrests made
and the names of the prisoners, and
thoutr i more than two weeks have elapsed
since the seizures took place the corre
spondents cannot pet accurate particulars.

"you Don't Become
a j^lave to their Use ! "
The above words have been
truthfully spoken concerning Dr. !
Pierces Pleasant Pellets by one '
who has had abundant opportunity i
to observe their more favorable ac- '
tion as compared with that of other
pills.
Most pills and medicines in use
for constipation, in the long run,
4 ' make a bad matter worse. ' ' Un-
like such agents, Dr. Pierces Pel- !
lets exert such a tonic or strength-
ening effect upon the membranes
of the stomach and bowels, as to ;
produce lasting benefit. Their use \
can, therefore, be gradually discon- .
tinued. With most pills the longer ;
they are taken, the more dependent '
upon their use the patient becomes.
Not so with the ' ' Pellets. ' ' Their 'â 
secondary effect is to keep the bow- i
els open and regular, not to further
constipate. Hence, their great i
popularity with sufferers from hab- !
itual constipation.
The Pellets cure costiveness, or |
constipation, biliousness, sick and
bilious headache, dizziness, sour
stomach, loss of appetite, coated
tongue, indigestion, or dyspepsia,
windy belchings, " heartburn,"
pain and distress after eating, and j
kindred derangements of the liver,
stomach and bowels. One little
"Pellet" is a laxative, two are I
mildly cathartic.

POMEROY, Wash., Jan. 7.-One of the
greate-t sensations ever known in church
circles here culminated last night in pre
cipitate flight to parts unknown of Rev.
P. James Lyons Younjr, pastor of the
Christian Church at this place, to escape
the clutches of the law for performing
marriage ceremonies without authority,
to avoid the disgrace of public dismissal
from his { ulpit and a ccat of tar and
feathers applied by willing hands of irate
husbands and fathers.
Dapper, smooth-tongued and pleasant,
Young arrived here last October with a
letter from the Baptist church of Ponca,
Nebr., representing binjself as a single
man. He became active in social circles
and immensely popular, especially with
women. He was active in proselyting and
made valuable acquisitions to the church.
He talked too much, however, and sus
picion was aroused.
.After a while evidence gathered against
him, but still some members of his con- I
grcgation had faith. Finally investiga- j
lions succeeded in locating Young's wife, j
Mary E. Lyons, at 318 .Blue Hill avenue,
lv>xbury, Ma^s., taking in washing for a
livelihood. They also located her attor
neys, Davis, Lyon it Gates, at Sioux Falls,

brought by Young in Moody County,
Soutu Dakota; also her Boston represent- j
ative, F. W. Harming: also Young's at

Last Monday his photograph arrived,
pccompanied by affidavits tracing Young,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 1897.
LOST THEIR LIVES
TO SAVE OTHERS
Heroic Work of an Eng
lish and a Mexican
Miner.
Through Smoke and Flames
They Struggle to Rescue
Their Comrades.
Return to the Earning Mine After
Being Safely Hoisted to
the Surface.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. 7.â Heroism,
such as is read about but seldom met with
in every-day life, was shown at the Santa
Gertrudis mine at Pachuca in the early
morning of December 31. Ned Richards,
an Englishman, vas the iiero, and through
his efforts to save the lives of others he
lost his own life.
The night shift was just about to go off
duty and a number of the men had
already reached the cage when a terrific
explosion occurred back in one of the
drifts. Several men, who were between
the fire and the cage, ran up, and others
could be heard shouting for help further
back. Ned Richards was among those
who could have escaped easily. Hastily
calling two of the boys to his assistance,
he ran back, braving the smoke and
flames and saved a Mexican who was
fainting in the drift.
They cjjaeged him to the cage, and then
a number cf others running up, it was
thought that all were accounted for and
the men all went to the top. The roaring
of the fire could be heard in the lower
levels and great volumes of smoke began
to fill the shaft.
The foreman procured his book and
checked off the names of the men. All
answered to their names except four.
Then, in spite of the awful danger, Ne-i
Richards offered to be one to go below
asrain and get the four missing men.
Three Mexicans stepped forward and
volunteered to accompany him. They
jumped into the case and were lowered
liown. Two of them went to their death-
Ned Richards and an unknown Mexican.
The fcfur men, when they reached the
level where the fire was raging, got out
and rnado a quick search as best they
could for the missing men. But the fire,
feeding on gases released by the explo
sion, filled all the empty spaces and
forced the men back to the cage. Ned
Richar ds made a gallant attempt to pene
trate into cne of the drifts, and was over
come with the fumes of gas and smoke.
He failed to return and the unknown
Mexican went after him. He found the
Englishman !}ing unconscious and
dragged him to the cage, but was in turn
overcome. The others gave the 3ignal and
were hoisted up.
Richards, before he died, said he would
rather die than to see his comrades die
like rats without any effort to save them
He and the unknown Mexican died witnin
a few minutes after being raised to the
surface.
It was learned afterward that eleven,
and not four men, were in the mine. The
deaths were therefore thirteen. At the
mouth of the mine the relatives of the
missing men gathered, and there were
sights of piteous suffering and anguish.

STANFORD IN THE
HEAT OF POLITICS
Fierce Contest for the Office
of Football Team
Manager.
A Triangular Struggle, With
John M. Switzer Apparently
in the Lead.
Gl:e end Mandolin Clubs R turn Out
of Pocket, but With Much
Experience.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.. Jan.
7. â One of the most interesting political
battles that has taken piace in university
politics for some time is now in progress
and the outcome will be decided to-mor
row. The content is over the office of
manager of the Viirsity football team of
'97, and the candidates are John Jt.
Switzer '93, T. M. Storke '98. and F. V.
Keesling '98. The election of football
manager is one of the duties of the ath
letic committee, and President Pomeroy,
who is chairman, has called a meeting of
the committee to-morrow afternoon to
perform this function.
The athletic committee is composed of
one member from each of the four classes,
four members elected from the student
body at large and in addition the managers
of the Varsity football, baseball and track
teams. Dave Brown 'i) 7 bolus the offices
of both football manager and track man
ager and thereby has the right to exercise
two votes. The contest will undoubtedly
be very close, probably hinging upon the
vote of one man.
The candidatss are all prominent in
student circles and in student body poli
tics. John M. Switzer, who seems to be
in the lead, has held several important
offices. Last year he was business mana
ger of the Sequoia, ai;d during the pres
ent year he held t lie office of manager of
the freshman football team and assistant
football manager, thereby Lecomine ider.Â«
titled with the football interests of tne
university. Keesling and Storke are the
opponents of Swiizer, and their interests
will probably be combined by the with
drawal of one or the other before the elec
tion. Frank V. Keesiing is one of the
most popular men in the junior clas^,
having been president of his class when a
freshman and beiifj: at present e.iitor-in
clnef of me Junior Annual. T. M. Siorke
is also a junior and has Been prominent in
b!i*cltaa as manager of tba class* athlet.c
teams several times. This is his first
entry in student bony politics.
Tue glee and mandolin clubs returned
to the university late this afternoon, hav
ing given their last concert at Sacramento
befoie a good house last evening. The
boys are niiich used up, the trip naving
been v very liard and wearisome one.
Treasurer F. W. Morrison, who accom
panied the clut> as manager, stated that
the trip had been made at a loss.
â¢The expenses of the trip," he said,
"will be in exces-j of $2000, wiiile the act
ual receipts are only in the neichborhood
of $15X). making a loss of $sjO or there
about?."
Before the clubs left the executive com
mittee of the student body, foreseeing .tne
probable result, required each membar of
the clubs mu&ing tne trip to deposit with
the treasurer their personal notes for $25
to cover any possible Joss on the tr.p. As
twenty-three men were taken on the trip
these notes amply insure the student
body against any loss. The clubs, how
ever, na.ve the privilege of giving concerts

NEWS OF LOS ANGELES.
Bar Association Adepts Amendments to
the Proposed Changes in the
Judiciary Act.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Jan. 7.â The Bar
Association to-day adopted amendments
to the proposed changes in the juJiciary
act from the San Francisco bar.
In plnce of the Supreme Court being re
stricted to sittings only in San Francisco,
it is recommended that the court sit in
three places. The kind of cases to be
heard by the proposed District Courts of
Appeal are also specified, and the
decision of such courts is to be
final, except ou questions where the
decision is in conflict with that of an
other court, when the question may be
certified to the Supreme Court. The
power of issuing writs of certiorari, pro
hibition, habeas corpus and the like is also
conferred on the courts of appeal.
A committee was appointed, consisting
of M. L. Graff, W. J. Hunsafcer. J. D.
Works and J. A. Anderson, to confer with
the other Bar Association committees and
v urge the matter in the Legislature.
lIM committee also recommended the
shortening of time for the dÂ»cision of cases
In the Supreme Court from ninety to
thirty days where it is orally argued and
sixty days in other cases, and from sixty
to thirty days in the District Court of
Appeals and Sujerior Courts in all caÂ«Â«>s.
Other changes of less importance were
embodied in the report. The committee
expressed itself in full sympathy with tlie
amendments for the prompt decision of
cases, but thought the principal object of
any judicial system should be the correct
ness and uniformity of decisions.

caucuses all day with a view of patching

CLOSING IN ON WEYLER.~
Gomez Follows Weyler's Example and
Orders Over One Hundred Pris
oners Shot
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. 7.âAl
though the steam tng Dauntless is in the
custody of an officer of the revenue cutter
Boutwell as a result of her last trip, from
which Bhe returned Monday night, her
owner this morning applied for clearance
papers for the steamer to go to Nuevitas,
Cuba, with a cargo of arms and ammuni
tion.
Deputy Collector Hopkin?, wno is in
charge of the office during the absence of
Coliecior Bisbee, refused to grant the
clearance until authorized to do so by the
Secretary of the Treasury. Secretary Car
lisle has ordered the Collector to refuse
clearance nntii further orders.
The officers of tha Dauntless still deny
that they have been to Cuba. All that
can be gotten from them is that they
transferred the men and cargo taken from
No Name Key to another vessel, presum
ably the Bermuda.
LONDON, Exg , Jan. 7.â The Times will
to-morrow publish a dispatch from its
Havana correspondent dated January 6.
In it, he says he learns from a private and
generally trustworthy source, that Anto
nio Maceo. who was reported to have been
killed through treachery at Punta Brava,
is still alive.
He is severely wounded, but is makine
favorable progress toward recovery. The
correspondent adds that he, himself,
thinks it unlikely that Maceo is alive, but
S3ys that it is not improbable. He also
says that the return of Captain-Genera!
Weyler to Havana without forcing the
rebels in Pinardel Rio to surrender may
b"e regarded as proof of his failure.
It is officially reportei that Gomez, with
a large force of rebels, is in the province
of Santa Clara advancing westward. The
insurgents completely destroyed the town
of BaiÂ«no, province of Havana, January 4.
ATLANTA. Ga., Jan. 7â The Constitu
tion uas a dispatch from Key West which
says that General Gomez has begun work
of reprisal against the Spaniards. In an
attack upon the Central trocha near
Moron he captured the Spanish garrison
at lagoaville of 114 men. They were noti
fied that, according to the precedent s-et
by their own Government, they shouid
prepare for their fate.
They were given an opportunity of writ
ing messages to their friends in Spain
and then in groups of twenty-five th*7
were shot to death. Weyler's announce
ment of the pacification of Pinar del Rio
doc? not stand. He left over 2000 in
surgents in the province.
He took additional soldiers from the
miliiary cordon to Havana to demonstrate
that there were no insurgents there, when
as soon as he removed them Cuban Gen
erals Rauol, Arago and Castilla marched
into the province of Pinar del Rio from
Havana wiÂ»h 3000 more men to re-enforce
the 5000 already there.
This all goes to throve how much confi
dence can be placed in the statements of
Weyler as to the attitude of the Cubans.
They are not afraid of the Spanisn and
not one man has surrendered in the prov
ince of Pinar del Rio.
The Spanish have recently established a
military zone around tne city of Havana,
including a space of five miles on all aides
tor the purpose of cultivation for
the existence of the people of
that city, which shows still further
to what ends they ara driven,
and how little sympathy and support
they can depend upon from the surround
ing country; also that they are daily los
ing ground, and so hard pressed are they
that this is all they can call their own
and that has to bs maintained by a mili
tary cordon from the attacks of the in
surgents.

;V- THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Merit should win.
The Senate is no place for dummies.
Slandering the Legislature won't help
the slanderers.
A California Senator should have some
thing of California vigor.
The Record-Union and the Examiner
make a nice pose as "the Heavenly
Twins."
From the way his tight is being made
Perkins has reason to pray to be saved
irom his friends.
Why should a Republican Senator em
ploy a Democratic organ to tell Republi
can legislators how to do their duty?
Honest legislators will take notice that
no railroad organ nor any boodle newspa
per is supporting Saruuei M. Shortridge.
When Senator Perkins made up his
mind 10 conduct a slander n^ht against
Ins opponents he knew exactly where to
look for an organ.
A candidate for the Senate who begins
his canvass by breakin.- his pledges to his
friends cannot be counted on to keep his
pledges to the people.
Judging from the reports in the Exam
iner it would teem, that Mr. Perkins is
getting ready to announce himself as a
fusion candidate for the Senate.
Why should the Republicans of Cali
fornia throw away the chance of a Cabinet
officer for the sake of allowing a Senator
to pose as the sole boss of the party?
It is noted that even in the States car
ried by the Bryanites the newly elected
officials are talking conservatively of
economy and business. The craze is over.
The charge that the Perkins men in the
Legislature are only waiting for bribes
may have been considered friendly by the
Examiner, but it is a poor way of helping
a friend.
The Republicans of California should
be represented in the United States Senate
by an orator who is capable of meeting in
debate the free-trader the Democrats have
placed there.
The support given by the Examiner to
the candidate of the Record-Union natur
aily raises the suspicion that there is a
secret hidden somewhere, and possibly in
a long green sactc.
One of ttie curious developments of the
Senatorial contest is the discovery of the
Record-Union and the Examiner in the
pame bed, and each apparently well satis
fied with its share of the cover.
The assaults made on Judsre Way mire
by the Democratic organ of Senator Per
kins shows how eager it is to divide the
Republican party and Low maliciously it
is willing to lie in order to do it.
It is now evident that Senator Perkins
is opposed to every Californian who has a
chance of an appointment to a position in
the Cabinet, and if the State obtains a
representative there it will be without his
help.
The assertion of the Examiner corre
spondent at Sacramento that one of the
workers against Perkins "said to-day that
at last they had some money to spend in
the right" is only another fake of the old
kind.
The funding bill is not the only measure
the Southern Pacific Company has before
Congress, and no man should be elected
to the Senate from California who does
not stand with the people not only on
that issue buc on all others.
The Progressive Democratic Clnb of
New York has resolved to work for the
nomination of Bryan in 1900, but long be
fore that time it will probably resolve it
self into a progressive euchre club with a
Bryan badge for the booby prize.
The Examiner declares editorially that
Perkins ia a mighty champion of the peo
ple against corporations, but its corre
spondent at Sacramento declares he has
never been able to see why the Southern
Pacific Company should have any objec
tion to him.
The Republicans of Pennsylvania have
rejected a millionaire with a great reputa
tion as a man of business and chosen as
their candidate for the United States Sen
ate a comparatively young man of brains
and ability, who has been trained in poli
tics and statecraft. The Republicans of
California should imitate the example.
The Southern Pacific Company is work
ing not only for the funding bill, but for
a harbor at Santa Monica, a claim for
transportation service and a mineral land
grab. It will forgive a Senator for voting
against funding if he will vote for the
othÂ« r t ings. Is it any wonder the Ex-,
aviiner and Record-Union have found rea
sons for coming together?
By the recent death of W. T. Willey
West Virginia has lost a man who was
chosen an elector on the Harrison and
Tyler ticket In 1840 and has held one office
or another continuously ever since, thus
having an office-holding record of about
fifty-six years, during which time he
sampled every form of political pa from
County Cierk to United States Senator.
It is no don tit hard to lose such a man,
but other office-seekers in the State will
try to till bis piace.
MERIT SHOULD WIN.
The canvass of Samuel M. Shortridge for the office of United States Senator has
been conducted upon the theory that merit should win. Upon that principle he has
stood and upon that only. Neither he nor his friends for him have urged his election
on any other ground. That has been the character of his canvass so far, and it will be
the Fame to the end.
Wit -out great wealth, without the aid of corporation influences, without alli
ances of any kind which, while assisting in his election, would entangle him in office
and interfere with his honorable service to the State and Nation, be has been put
[ forward as a candidate for ;he Senate by men who know his worth and desire to have
California fitly represented at Washington. It is by merit he has won this honor at
the hands of his friends, and in supporting him for the office they ask the suffrages of
legislators upon no other ground than that on which they themselves have acied.
Feeling assured that Mr. Shortridge is the man of all others to represent California
and Republicanism in the Senate at this juncture his friends have made his canvass
strictly upon lines of truth. They have not mocked at the claims of other candidates,
nor have they vilified, reviled or slandered those candidates personally. His friands
have not even misrepresented his opponents, but have made his fight soleiy upon his
own pre-eminent qualifications for the office.
The time has come in the history of California when a man of Mr. Shortridge's
independence and attainments ought to be considered by all who are charged with the
duty of electing a representative of the State to the National Senate. This truth his
friends have consistently maintained since the beginning of the canvass and they have
had the approval of leaders of all sections of the party. Republicans throughout the
State desire their principles to be upheld in the Senate by an advocate who can defend
them with learning, logic, argument, law and eloquence, and for that reason they
are as eager aa any that in the contest for the office merit should win.
No effort made by any set of men to foreclose by ex parte proceedings a lien upon
the senatorship should be permitted to prevail against the claims of ability, honesty
and loyal service to the State and to the party. Ever since he arrived at man's estate
Mr. Shortridge has been an untiring and efficient worker for the Republican party in
California and a stalwart supporter of its principles and its candidates.
He has proven by his accomplishments, both in public and in private affairs, that
he is a man who would worthily adorn the high office to which he aspires. His
friends sustain him en the record he has made, and ask support for him on no other
ground than that he has deserved well of his party and his State, and merits the honor
of promotion to higher fields of labor.
It is a familiar saying of Napoleon, "Open the way to talentâ the tools to him
who can use them." Is the way open for talent in the politics of California? Are
the tools of high office given to those who can use them to the best advantage to the
State? Can merit aspire with any chance of success when unaided by money or the
influence of corporations? The^e questions are to be answered by the Republicans of
ttoe Legislature. We wait the answer with confidence. Merit should win, and if
right counsels prevail it wilL
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
The San Francisco Examiner and the Sacramento Record-Unton are advo
cating the election of Mr. Per Kins to the United States Senate, and are each engaged
in belittling, reviling, denouncing and ridiculing the claims of every other candidate.
What does that mean?
The Record-Union is openly and avowedly subsidized, by the Southern Pacific
Company. The San Francisco Examiner, it is known, was not long ago subsidized by
that company, but was afterward cut off from the payroll. The Record-Union is
openly fighting the battles of the railroad company, and as its champion desires to
procure the election of a United States Senator who will be favorable to all legislation
which the company desires from the National Government. The- Examiner, though
loudly protesting to be a supporter of the interests of the people, advocates the elec
tion of the same man whom the Record-Union supports. Is it not clear that some
alliance has been formed between these apparently opposing parties?
It must be understood for a proper comprehension of this strange alliance that
the funding bill is not the only legislation which the railroad company desires to ob
tain from Congress. It is altogether probabla that the Southern Pacific Company may
have agreed that Senator Perkins should vote against that bill, and even make a feeble
and .ukewarm speech against it, while obtaining from him pledges that he would
support their interests in other matters not less important to it.
Among the measures belore Congress in which the Southern Pacihc Company is
interested there are the improvement of Santa Monica harbor, the mineral lands bill
and its pending claims for the transportation of troops and mail. Each of these in
volves money interests amounting to millions. The Santa Monica job would be In
itself a most extensive benefit to the corporation at the expense of the people. The
claims made against the Government for transportation of troops and mails aegre
gate many millions of dollars. The scheme of the company to obtain possession of
mineral lands involves an even jjreater fraud upon those who in eood faith have ac.
quired claims to these lands. It is the desire of the company'to obtain patents for
millions of acres, many of which are now in the hands of bona-ride holders,
whom the railroad company would oust from their possession if favorable legislation
could be obtained for that purpose.
This being the condition of affairs, it requires no great discernment to see why
the Southern Pacihc Company is desirous of obtaining the election of a United States
Senator pledged to its interest in other thines even while permitted to make a show of
opposition to the funding bill. That the Record-Union snpports Mr. Perkins is open
evidence that the railroad considers him favorable to its interests, ar.d that the
Examiner 3hou!d support him while professing opposition to the railroad is not al all
inconsistent with the course of that paper, which has been in the past secretly sub
sidized and desires a return to the payroll.
There are many reasons why Mr. Perkins should be willing to enter into an
alliance with the Southern Pacific Company, partly open as displayed by the Record'
Union, and partly secret as evidenced by the Examiner. The Southern Pacific Com
pany is a f;reat transportation agent. Senator Perkins is himself the representative
of another great transportation company. Between the railroad and the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company there are many opportunities for making bargains to enrich
themselves by levying tax, tribute and blackmail upon the commerce and industries
of San Francisco and California. Is it not likely that some such combination has
been form d and that the re-election of Perkins to the Senate is a part of the deal?
The complexity of the situation certainly calls for examination. The Record-Union
and the Examiner are not working together for nothing. The alliance of the organ of
the monopoly with the organ of the sandlot implies that there is a secret arrangement
between the parties. It is the duty of careful legislators to investigate this bargain
and find out what it means. The Examiner and the Record-Union are posing as
heavenly twins, but beneath their seeinine angelic union there is doubtless work of
the devil going on.

PRESENT AND VOTING.
The Legislature will probably hold but
a brief session to-day and adjourn until
next Monday. On tha following day the
first ballot for United States Senator wiil
be taken in each house separately.
The joint session for the same purpose
will convene on Wednesday next. The
Federal statute provides that the majority
of the members "present and voting"
shall be requisite to the selection of a
Senator. It is a duty wbicb every
member of the Legislature owes to the
State without regard to party to be present
and to vote upon the issue as to who will
be chosen Senator.
It is to be hoped that no legislator will
either neglect this important duty or be
enticed into a failure to be present and
perform it when the roll is called upon the
Senatorial election on each and every
occasion when the question comes up for
decision.
THE ENEMY'S TAOTIOS.
The attack made upon Judire Waymire
by the Democratic organ which is sup
porting Mr. Perkins in his effort to pro
cure a re-election to the Senate is suffi
cient to make clear to even the most un
wary Republican the tactics which are be-
ing employed by the enemies oi the Re
publican party to divide it, demoralize it,
and as far as possible weaken its useful
ness to California.
It is now evident beyond any further
doubting that the Examiner intends, if
possible, to defeat every effort wnicb the
.Republicans may make to advance the in
terests of California and increase its pres
tige in the Union. It desires, first, to
bring about the election of a mere figure
head Senator who will reflect do credic on
the State; and, second, to prevent the ap
pointment of a Californian to the Cabinet.
If it snould succeed in these efforts it
would injure the State, but would un
doubtedly succeed in promoting the

chances of Democrats or Populists in the
ensuing elections. These, then, ore the
tactics of the enemy, and loyal Repub
licans should be warned by them how to
act at this juncture to strengthen the Re
publican party by demonstrating its abil
ity to advance all the interests of the peo
ple and t;.e commonwealth.
In the present fight the Examiner poses
as the enemy of the Republican party, but
its tactics exhibit it as the eremy of the
Sate. Its slanders upon Republican
members of the Legislature, its efforts to
divide the party so tbat no man can be
supported for a Cabinet position and its
endeavdrs to bring about tne re-election
of a Senator who is distinctly inferior ia
debating power to the Democratic repre
sentative of the Stata now in the Senate,
are all part of a scheme intended to dis
grace the Republican party if possible,
evezi though the whole State and the wel
fare of ail its people should be made to
suffer in consequence.
Judge Waymire needs no defense
against the slanders with which the Exam
iner has assailed him. His character has
been established among his fellow-citi
zens by long years of honorable labor both
in public and in private life. His reputa
tion has been developed by the judg
ments of honorable men on his honorable
service. He has a laudable ambition to
serve the State in the broad fields of Na
tional politics, and none can deny
that he is eminently fitted for such du
ties. He has entered into the contest for
high office with a generous Bpirit and has
been frank, loyal and courteous to all.
When the Examiner attacks him it simply
gives new evidence of its hostility to Re
publicans, ita indifference to the welfare
of California and its capacity for malicious
lying.
SLANDERING CALIFORNIA.
The Sacramento correspondent of the
Examiner, in giving what purported to be
an account of the contest now being made
aeain t the re-election of Senator Perltins,
stated that the opposition were using
money to bribe Republican legislators to
vote against Mr. Perkins. The statement
was made explicitly. The correspondent
said: "One of the workers in their cause
said to-day that' they at last had some
money to spend in the fight."
The correspondent did not name which
one of the workers said it nor to whom it
was said. The statement will therefore
be recognized by everybody in California
aa merely another fake of that disreput
able organ. Beyond the borders of the
Slate, however, where the character of the
Examiner is not so well known, it will
have its influence in determining the
judgment of people concerning tt.e Cali
fornia Legislature. It will set abroad re
ports that the Republican majority of the
Legislature is subject to bribes, and will
give ground for assertions that whoever is
elected to the Senate owes his office to
bribery and corruption.
Against these faked aspersions on the
honor of the State and the integrity of
our legislators the press and the people of
California cannot protest too loudly nor
too frequently. Our commonwealth has
already suffered too much from the sen
sational fakes published by the Examiner.
These stories are tajcen up in the East and
circulated to our injury. They give an
altogether false impression of the cl^ss of
people who dominate our society and poli
tics, and thousands of people who mi/ht
otherwise come to the State to make their
homes are led to stay away and shun
California as if it were a land -of plague
and pestilence.
Fakes of the kind which the Examiner
is publishing concerning the Legislature
are not only outside the limits of truth
and leuitimate journalism, but in their
falseness and their vileness they exceed
the bounds of common decency. It may
be considered by the Examiner good Demo
cratic tactics to defame the Legislature be
cause it is .Republican, even if in bo doing
the fair fame of the State is defiled. Hod
orable Democrats, however, will not give
their approval to such tactics. They will
see that these false assertions will not
affect the Republican party in the State
because no one in the State wilL believe
them, but that they will affect Eastern
opinion concerning the honesty of Cali
fornians and will therefore injure the
commonwealth. On the ground of ex
pediency, therefore, as well as of honor
and justice, intelligent Democrats will
condemn the course which the professed
organ of their party has taken in its ef
forts to secure the re-election of the man
who?-e cause it has for some secret reason
determined to champion.
As for the Republicans of the Legisla
ture they have uut one course to pursue,
and that is to repudiate the assertions of
the journalistic faker and reject the can
didate whom it seeks to support by such
disreputable means.

THE PERFIDY OF POLITICIANS.
Sau Francisco Bulletin.
If California has lost that representation in the Cabinet of President-elect McKlnley to
which by political importance the State was entitled, and which would have of suchyreat
advantage to the whole Pacific Coast region, the little clique of politicians who nave managed
the fight of George C. Perkins for the United States Senatorship are to thank lor it. it is an
obligation neither the State nor the Republican party will forget. These gentlemen, ana ben
ator Perkins as the chief of them, may fancy their present courses will be glossed o\er oyine
smoothing hand of time, that in the future there may be that disappearance of animosities
marking the purely human carelessness coming of forgetfulness. There are some crimes mat
do not outlaw. Political perfidy iÂ» an offense against which the statute of limitations aoes
not run.
The ambition to serve as the representative of a great State in the Senate of the Cnltea
States is an honorable ambition. It is to the credit of any man that he has achieved a position
where the cherishing of a desire to so serve is food neither for ridicule nor serious criticism.
George C. Perkins has never been conspicuous for his brilliant service to the public nor for his
massive intellectuality. He has not been a statesman of the highest clas*. Until he arrived
at the city of Washington in the last month of the year 18JH3 there had at least not been a
suspicion that he would not stand to his pledges. Senator Perkins went to Wash
ington with his own re-electiou all but assured, but under the fear that
the powerful influence of the Southern Pacific would be thrown against
him. It has become apparent, from the developments at Washington and
at Sacramento, that he permitted his fear of that influence to outrun his discretion. There is,
in fact, no other conclusion to be drawn from those developments. Senator Perkins went to
Washington under fear of the hostility of Mr. Huntington, but pledged also to the support of
Mr. James A. Waymlre for the Cabinet. The whole of California, in fact, was for Waym re. It
is not relevant to the question whether the support of Senator Perkins was of value or whether
it was not. The point is in the position of that gentleman and in his sudden and complete
self-reversal. Senator Perkins reached Washington, where Mr. Huntington, with
all his forces about him, was making the fight of his life for
the Pacific railroad funding bill, and at once there was a change. The State
was startled by the projection of the name of Horace Davis into the struggle for appointment
to the Cabinet, creating new hostilities where the vital essential to success was perfect har
mony, and by the spectacle of Senator Perkins and Grove L. Johnson standing as sponsors for
Davis. The State is startled, also, though less startled, by the plain fact that what influence
the Southern Pacific may have at Sacramento was no longer hostile to Senator Perkins.
Senator Eli Denison of Alameda, always an advocate of Southern Pacific measures and him
self an agent of that corporation, is openly supporting Perkinsâ it is said, in return for a prom
ise of appointment to the Superintendency of the Mint The Sacramento Record-
Union, owned by Mr. Huntington and edited from the main office of the
Southern Pacific, is advocating the election of Perkins in double-leaded edi
torials. The whole pack is in full cry. Whatever cause the gentleman had to fear the railroad
power betore his departure for Washington, he has clearly no reason for alarm now. It is, in
fact, rather a strange thing that this hostility should have been excited in the first place.
Senator Perkins is a large holder of corporate interests himself, and not naturally the foe to
corporations which do not enter into direct business competition with his own.
Whether the discovery of the conspiracy that has betrayed the interests of the State has
not come too late for the present punishment of the conspirators is an open question. That
they will be punished eventually is a foregone conclusion. Though the arm of the people may
be withheld for a time It strikes home when the hour has come for vengeance.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS
L. 11. Gray of Seattle, general agent of the
freight department of (he Great Nortnern
Railroad, the newest of all the transconti
nental lines, is among the arrivals at the
Grand. He is here for only a few d^ys, when
he will return north. Mrs. Gray accompanied
him and is going to Los Angeles to meet her
mother.
According to Mr. Gray business is far better
at Seattle than anywhere in Western Washing,
ton, and better than at any place in the State
except Spokane.
"Spokane has hRd all the advantages of the
growth of the British Columbia mines," he
paid. "There is a big boom on up there.
Rossland has grown immensely; Kaslo and
the countiy around there has developed fast.
These mines have orought a large amount of
money into Spokane.
"But on the west side there is no other town

that surpasses Beattle in a business way.
That is the business place. I don't own prop
erty there and am unprejudiced. Any one can
see at a glance the difference between that
place and other towns.
"There are about 60,000 people at Seattle,
but there is no building- They will not Duild
till they see what the Populists are going to
do. But Seattle men tell me that they had the
best trade daring the holidays that they had
for five years. All kinds of business men say
that, big ana little and whatever line they are
in. It is said to be holding up, too, fairly
well.
"But a man can't borrow a cent in Seattle,
no matter what his security is.' I don't be
lieve, no matter how much property a man
has as an inducer, that any money can be got.
They won't lend money to anybody."
Mr. Gray tftea a practical view of the mat
ter. He does not anticipate that business will
be better on Puget Sound for some time yet.

WHEAT MAY NOT
GO MUCH HIGHER
There Is More of It in This
State Than Rumor
Says.
A Further Inflation of Prices
Here Depends Upon a Better
Foreign Rats.
F-rmers Hoard Wheat and Call Eoard
Warehouses Do Not Represent
the Stock.*
Hundreds of wheat farmer throughout
the State are happy because of the en
hanced value of the great staple and the
prospect that it will become much more
valuable than it is to-day.
It was erroneously announced in an aft
ernoon raper yester lay that local ship
pers were paying $16"-'% P er cemal for
wheat and that there are but 250,000 tons
in the State.
"The truth is," said Herman Eppinger
of the well-known commission company
last night, "that there is more wheat here
than people know about. Whether wheat
is to go higher depends not on its scarcity,
but on whether the foreign market goes
higher. The highest prices to-day are
$1 5734 for the choicest shipping grades,
and for the best milling wheat $1 62%.
Number one shipping wheat brings from
$1 56J^ to $1 57K. ' ">-â "'
"It is wrong to assume that there are
but 250,000 tons of wheat in the State, for
the stock in call board warehouses does
not represent the total product. These
warehouses are largely at Stockton, Port
Costa and like places, but there are great
quantities outside of tnis, mucn of it in
the bins and barns of sturdy old farmers
and stored away in small warehouses.
"The Produce Exchange took an in
voice on December 1 and found 300,000
tons in the hands of dealers and in call
board warehouses. There are large quan
tities of grain in the country and on
ranches, considerable of which is offered
right along by ranchers and farmers."
A Call reporter found that large quan
tities of wheat are coming from other
Western States, so that the scarcity here
is not at all great, yet greater than for
many years
"Large offerings are made fram Utah
and Idaho," said Mr. Eppin^er last ni;:ht,
"because our prices art higher than the
local prices in those regions. T ey can
not ship East and realize no well as by
selling here, for the freights eat up more
than the difference in price."
A strange phase of the question is that
many Englisn ships are unable to deal in
wheat. Ship-owners cannot afford to take
it at present prices and many of them are
taking cargoes of lumber to England, Aus
tralia and the west coast of South Amer
ica. Ships have recently left tins port for
Puget Sound becausJ it pays Detter to
carry lumber than wheat at its i resent
rates.
Many dealers are sanguine that prices
will go higher, yet tne general opinion is
that nothing but v great stimulus to the
foreign market can cause prices to co
much beyond what they are now. Those
who look for an inflation of the foreign
price count on two factorsâ a small crup
in the wteai- raising areas and a scarcity
in the wheat-consuming countries of the
world.
LEVIN BEOS.' AFFAIES.
The Firm Offers to Settle for 33 1-3
Cents.
There was an important and well attend
ed meeting yesterday of the committee of
seven appointed by the creditors of
Levin Bros, to investigate the af
fairs of the crippled firm. The ob
ject of the meeting was to hear the re
port of the adjusters who had been em
ployed to examine the books of the con
cern and submit a detailed statement of
assets and liabilities.
The report gave a stated list of every
creditor wjth the amount due him ami
also of the items comprising the assets of
the firm. A summary, as published in
The Call of yesterday, ohowed that the
labilities were nearly $130,000, while the
available assets did not exceed $40,000.
While this statement was beiug dibcussed
the attorney for Levin Bros, announced
that he had a proposition to submit to
the creditors from tfoe nrm whose affairs
were under consideration.
He stated that Levin Bros, were pre
pared to make a settlement on the basis of
33% cents on the dollar. Just what form
the payment waa to take in case the offer
was accepted could not be learned, but it
is supposed that there will be a part cash
payment and that the balance will be
liquidated by indorsed notes.
The somewhat unexpected action on the
part of the insolveut firm produced a
much more considerate feeling to prevail
among the creditors. According to the
statement submitted by the adjusters,
there were assets wortu something less
than $40,000. It is estimated that if the^e
were lorced upon the market they would
not realize more than half their invoice
valuation.
While some of the creditors are opposed,
on sentiment, to any settlement short of
100 cents on the dollsr most of them are
inclined to take a practical business view
of the situation. As one of them said yes
terday: ; 'lt would be iootish to refuse to
take one-third of what is dus us from the
rirm and instead force a sale of the assets
and then have to be satisfied with about
15 cents on the dollar."
Before the meeting of the committee of
seven, a committee of three, consisting of
Mr. Lilienthal of the Crown Distilleries
Company, J. P. Edoff of Dalleraand & Co.
and A. L. Whitney of C. E. Whitney, was
appointed to present the report of the
adjusiers and the offer of Levin Bros, to
the meeting of all the creditors, which is
to be held at 2:30 p. m. to-day at the rooms
of the Board of Trade.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 1897.
Quarantine Boats and the Tug Active, With the Occidental and Oriental Officials on Board,
Surrounding the Steamer Coptic, Just Getting In From the Orient. News Came by the
Last Mail That Cholera Was Epidemic in China.
CHOLERA IS NOT
RAGING FIERCELY
So Say All the Passen
gers on the Steamer
. Coptic.
Nevertheless Chinese Steerage
Passengers and the Mail.
Were Quarantined.
Burglaries on the Water Front Are
Frequentâ A Suit of Sails Stolen
Off a Schooner.
There was considerable excitement
along the water front yesterday when the
Occidental ana Oriental Steamship Com
pany's Coptic was sighted. Rumors of
cholera in China had preceded the vessel
ana both the quarantine boats were out
to meet her. The company's tug Millen
Griffith was laid up for repairs, so the
Spreckels tug Active was pressed into
the service, and she also went speeding
down the bay to meet the incoming liner.
Off Black Point the vessel was inter
cepted and Dr. Blue and Dr. Chalmers
made a thorough examination of overy
person aboard. From Honckong, Yoko
hama and Honolulu the Coptic had a
clean bill of health and was therefore en
titled to dock. The medical men, how
ever, came to the conclusion that it was
better to be sure than sorry, so they or
dered ail the mail matter, 102 Chinese and
six Japanese to be sent ashore for fumiga
tion at the quarantine station on Angel
Island. In consequence it will be late
this afternoon before any Chinese, Japan
ese or Hawaiian mail will be delivered.
Among the cabin passengers on the
Coptic were Mr. and Mrs. Newhall, who
returned from their honeymoon trip to
Japan. Both say they had a splendid
time.
The tug Vigilant went out to the Faral
lones yesterday. Captain Silovich says
that his lady passenger was terribly sea
sick when crossing the bar and that many
a time she wished she had not accepted
the position of teacher to the lighthouse
keeper's children. The pigeons sent put
by the hydrographic olfice were saielj'
landed and to-day two of them may be
expected, bringing with them the news of
the wind and weather in the vicinity of
the island.
J. Winslow, thÂ« popular head stevedore
on the Mail dock, is once again at his post.
Seveial months ago he fell into the hold
of the steamer Newport, while superin
tending the stowing of her cargo, and
broke his leg. A couple of days ago he
put in an appearance, assisted by a couple
of sticks, and as soon as the 'longshore
men saw him they gave him an ovation.
Sunday the Newport is expected in from
Panama and way ports, and Winslow
vows that as soon as the cargo is out he
will go into the hold and put a red cross
on the spot where he struck.
The water front is infested with petty
thieves. They take everytning in sight,
and in one instance stole the sails of a
boat while the crew slept. Last Tuesday
night the tug Fearless was raided and the
men's clothing stolen. An oyster-boat
lying at Harrison-street wharf lost her
cargo, everything movable was tafcen from
the scow Nat hale, and as nothing else
could be found on the schooner Ida Me-
Cune, her suit of Bails was stolen. The
harbor police are on the alert, and at least
half a dozen policemen and private detec
tives are on the watch.
Tbe Vallejo steamer Monticello ran on
the Mare Island shoal on the last trip
"Wednesday night. The vessel was not
damaged, but the passengers were con
siderably inconvenienced by tbe delay.
A much more serious matter, however, is
the charge made by the captain and own
ers of the opposition boat Sunol. They
assert that the captain o! the Monticello
gave them a false signal, which, if it had
been followed, would have landed the
Sunol high and dry in the mud a few
hundred feet from the Monticello. "It
was simply an attempt to put our boat
where the other one was," said A. E.
Pryor, general manager of the Piper,
Aden, Goodall Company, yesterday.
"Tbe Monticello was ahead, and when
she went on the mud bank Captain Ran
dall gave two blasts from the steamer's
whistle. That meant for the Sunol to
take the inside course, but our captain
discovered where he was just in time and
backed out of danger. The matter will
be laid before the Inspectors of Hulls and
Boilers to-day, and they can lay the blame
where it belongs."
The Messrs. Hatch, owners of the Mon
ticello, deny any knowledge of the affair
and stoutly assert that they court an in
vestigation.
Sea Otter Hunting Lawg.
The Custom-house yesterday received from
the Treasury Department the latest copy of
rules and regulations relating to fur seal fish
ing and sea otter hunting during 1897. Arti
cle I states that "every vessel employed in sea
otter minting, or in transporting sea otter
parties snail have, in addition to the papers
vow returned by law, a special clearance and
license. Article VI, relerring to other pre
ceding rules, etc., says: "These regulations
apply only to American vesselx. Foreign ves
sels of every description will not be allowed to
hunt sea otter within the tbree-miles limit
under penalty of seizure. " The foregoing
changes and additions are about the only new
features in the latest instructions and rules.

SPREADING THE NET.
Federal Warrants Have Been Issued
for the Australian AlurÂ«
d erer.
While the ship Swanhilda breasts the
seas bound from Sydney, N. S. W., for
this port, the authorities, both Federal
and police, are using the time in which to
spread more effectively the net that shall
capture the arch-murderer, Frank Butler,
alias Frank Harwood, and alias half a
dozen other names, who is believed to be
aboard her. Chasing a murderer across a
continent is not a novelty in this day, but
chasing a criminal half-way around the
world against tiruu is a novelty, and is at
tracting the attention of the people of the
earth. Tnis is what Detectives Conroy
and McHattieof Sydney are doing, and
they will have arrived fully two weeks
ahead of the Swanhilda.
The detectives landed at Victoria, B. C,
from the Miowera last Tuesday. They
were expected here yesterday, but did not
come for the reason that hardly enough
time has eiapsed in which to make the
trip by rail. If they do not spend a day
at Victoria sight-seeing, they will be due
to-day wit., additional particulars. The
Swaubilda is due about January 25. It is
hardly possible that Butler can escape
arrest at last unless he jumps overboard
into the Pacific while en ronte.
British Vice-Consul Moore said yester
day that everything is luily and satisfac
torily arranged in regard to extradition '
papers and the necessary local warrant
for butler's arrest. The latter has been
issued by Judge Morrow of the United
States District Court.
Mr. Curmuc of the firm of Cormac &
Donohoe, colonial attorneys here, said
yesterday that he was gratified at the
publicity the coming of Butler is receiv
ing, "as it will greatly decrease the
chances of his escape," said he. "He is a
desperate criminal and would not hesi
tate at another murder, unless so com
pletely caught that he could not make a
move.
"We thought that he might leave the
ship at Honolulu," he said, "ana took
precautions accordingly. We found that
the shiD would not touch at that port.
We had a man th-re on the lookout for
the murderer and he would have been
caught if the Swanhilda put in there. I
expected the Sydney detectives to-day,
but they have probably not had time
enough to get here."
PHILADELPHIA ON FIRE.
Uncle Sam's Big Cruiser Dam
aged by a Blaze in Her
Coal Bunkers.
A Letter Received in This City Brings
N.ws That the F ames Raged
Three Hours.
A letter written by one of the crew of
the cruiser Philadelphia was received in
this City last week, which tells the story
of a disastrous tire in the cruiser's bunkers
on the morning of her arrival at Callao,
Peru.
Tbe letter covers the entire voyage of
the cruiser from the day she left this port.
November 28, up to the breaking out and
subsequent flooding of tiie fire at Callao.
It states that the trip down the coast was
an uneventful one and everything ran uu
usually smooth.
Calluo was reached and the crew was
busy scrubbing down the decks when an
alarm of fire was sounded. The crew was
informed as to the whereabouts of the tire,
but, as the ship rapidly tilled with smoke,
had considerable difficulty playing water
on the blazing coal. All the ship's venti
lator.i and passageways tending to create
a draught were closed, ana the crew
fought the fire with renewed vigor.
"Notwithstanding the fact that all the
water possible was used," said the writer
of the letter, "the plates in the magftzine
room became po heated that Â«n order to
abandon ship would not have surprised
me.
"After three hours' hard work the (lames
were extinguished in the coal-bunkers,
but the tire broke cut in an adjoin
ing room from tbe heated plates.
The crew was again put to work and in
a half hour had the fire out. The hatch
plates were cooled to prevent further
damage by running streams of water over
them, and the excitement enaed."
In conclusion tUe letter stated that the
ship would leave Callao for Panama in a
short time, an i from there would sail for
San Die^o, probably arriving at that port
in the latter part of Februarj .

CHITA JACKSON
AGAIN ARRESTED
This Time She Is Charged
With Grand Lar
ceny.
Mrs. Kittie Durning, a Neigh
bor, Is the Complaining
Witness.
Chita Is Accused of Stealing From
Her a Solitaire Diamond Ring
and Fin.
Emma Cleverly, better known as Chita
Jackson, the young woman who first came
into notoriety by stating that she was the
last person who saw Eugene Ware, the
murdered drug clerk in the St. Nicholas
Pharmacy, alive, is again in trouble.
Yesterday morninc, Mrs. Kittie Dur
ning, 843 Mission street, swore to a com
plaint in Judge Low's court, charging her
with grand larceny.
Emma and her husband lived at 846
Mission street, and on November 14 she
made the acquaintance of Mrs. Durning,
at the racetrack. Emma called upon Mrs.
Downing the following day and the latter
snowed her her jewelry.
On November 16 Kinina again called,
and while Mrs. Durning was absent from
the room fora few minutes she stole her
jewel case, containing a solitaire diamond
ring with gold settim: and a gold horse
shoe diamond pin of the value of $160.
The ring and pin were pawned by Emma
with H. Abrams & Co., 785 Mission street,
lor $55, and she went on a visit to her
friends at Livermore. She returned last
evening and Policemen T. L. Ryan and
Ed ODea, who had been detailed on the
case, arrested her and booked her at the
Southern Police station.
The ring and pin were recovered from
Abrams & Co., and Abrams called ai the
police station and identified Emma as the
woman who pawned them.
Emma has been very fortunate. About
a year ago she was arrested for robbing a
farmer named Jackson of $40. She de
clared that JacKson fell in love with her,
proposed marriage and gave her the money !
as a present. She was held to answer be
fore the Superior Court, but a jury in
Judge Banrs' court believed her story
and she was acquitted,
Sums months ago she made the ac
quaintance of Riuhard Brewer, a saloon
keeper on Merchant street, and he en
gaged her to nlay the piano in liis saloon.
He became infatuated with her, and on
her promUe that she would marry him
he advanced her various sums of money,
aegregatine over $500, and became surety
for a piano she bought on the installment
plan.
Brewer finally discovered that she was
married and he had her arrested tor ob
taining money by false pretenses. The
case was dismissed in the Police Court,
and for the second time Emma escaped
punishment.
She is a tall, handsome young woman,
with fascinating manners. Her husband
is an Engiislimun, and is in receipt of a
monthly remittance from the "old coun
try."

Chief Crowley Is Furnished
With a List of Their
Names.
Efforts of the Police Have in the Past
Been Nuilifi d by the Police
Judges.
Chief Crowley has determined once
more to make an attempt to rid the cor
ridors of the City Hall of men who are
familiarly known as "grafters."
Complaints were received by the Chief
yesterday that these men were systemati
cally at work, and a list was handed to
him. In the list were the names of Matt
Smith, Ben Smith. Jack Bolster, Dick
Creighton, "Chippy" Gallagher and Wi;
liam Tannion, and" it was mentioned that
other names would be forthcoming.
In the list were the names of a janitor
and several attorneys, but as they have a
right to be in the corridors their names
were stricken out.
The Chief sent for Policeman Wagner,
who is specially detailed for duty in the
corridors, and handed him the list with
instructions to arrest the men if they
made their appearance in the neichbor
hood of the Police Courts or the Justice
of the Peace Courts and charge them with
violating the ordinance passed by the
Supervisors specially to cover such ca?es.
Several arrests have been male by Po
liceman Wagner, including Tannion, Gal
lagher and others, but in almost every
instance the cases wpre dismissed in the
police courts, and the men after keeping
away from the corridors for a few weeks
returned again and continued their work
as boldly as ever.
The Chief is now determined to maKe
wholesale arrests, and the responsibility of
ridding the corridors of "grafters" will be

An elderly lady living at Fordham Heights, a. part of New York City, and who
was known to be a warm advocate of Ripans Tabules for any case of liver trouble or
indigestion, said toa reporter who visited her for the purpose of learning the particu-
lars of her case: " 1 had always employed a physician and did so on the last occasion
I had for one, but at that time obtained no beneficial results. I had never had any
faith in patent medicines, but having seen Ripans Tabules recommended very highly
in the New York HermU, I concluded to give them a trial, and I found they were just
what my case demanded. I bare never employed a physician since, and that means a
earing of $2 a call. A dollar's worth of
Ripans Tabules
laeta me a month, and I would not be without them now if it were my last dollar."
At the time of this interview there were present two daughters who specially objected
to their mother giving a testimonial which should parade her name in the news-
papers, but to this the elder lady arcrued : " There may be other cases juÃt like mine,
and I am sure I take great pleasureln recommending the tabules to any one affected
as I \va?. If the telling about my case in the papers enables some other person similarly
affected to be as greatly benefited as I have been, I see no objection." And the
daughters, familiar with nor case and knowing how earnestly she felt about the bene-
fit sno had received from Ripans Tabules, decided that their mother was quite right.

IRRESPONSIBLE
POLICE COURTS
The Grand Jury Would
Have Them Made
Responsible.
Clerks and Prosecutors Should
Be Made Amenable to
Somebody.
County Clerk Should Appoint the For
mer and ths District AttorÂ«
ney the Letter.
If the Civic Federation really means to
attempt the reform of Police Court meth
ods which have for so long served to pro
tect evildoers wherever it seemed worth
while it will find a very valuable assistant
in the present Grand Jnry.
The committee of the Grand Jury dele
gated to the especial duty of investigating
the police and other courts held its first
formal meeting yesterday, and Judge
Low, in response to an invitation, at
tended the session, and, answering their
inquiries, gave the members much to
think about.
Foren;an Peixotto attended the meet
ing, and in speaking last evening of the
matter under discusssion he said: "The
Jai methods in vogue in our police courts
have long been a matter of public scan
dal. They should be corrected. The
Grand Jury, however, is powerless to do
more than to call publicattention to them
and recommend a change.
"The main trouble arises from the fact |
that the Police Court clerjcs and prosecut
ing attorneys are appointed by the Board
of Supervisors and are amenable to nobody
but that board. As Juiige Low put it this |
afternoon, 'the Supervisors make the ap
pointments, and from that moment have
no further interest in them.' So the prose
cuting attorneys and clerks practically run j
the courts in many re^pects wholly inde
pendent of anybody. Tneir books are said
10 be very badly kept, and there have been
charges of money purloined.
"As to the prosecution of cases bronght
in the courts the system is also very weak.
There is no continuity in cases held for
the higher court; they go up to the Dis
trict Attorney wifh nothing more than
tne mere record. Now alt this couia be
cured by simply making somebody re
sponsible. If, lor instance, the District
Attorney had the appointment of the
prosecuting attorneys he would be re
sponsible for what they did ; he would re
quire them to report to him; they would
keep their records in such shape as to bear
his inspection, and in cases carried into
the criminal courts they could follow or
otherwise assist in the prosecution.
"The clerks on the other hand micht be
appointed by the County Clerk and he,
in turn, be held responsible for their con
duct. He would see that their bonds were
goo'i, for instance. At present it is said
to be notorious that the bonds of these
officers of the police courts were worth
less and have nearly always been so."
The Grand Jury will meet to-day, but
no report of the committee referred to will
be made for some time.
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH
Arthur Meadows' Thrilling Ex
perience in an Elevator
Shaft.
A Perilous Side From the Third Story
of the San Francisco* Furniture
Factory.
The spectacle of a man banging by a
Blender rope in the freight-elevator shaft
of the Francisco furniture factory â
three stories from the bottomâ electrified
a number of people yesterday morning. .
Arthur Meadows, manager of Lang's
collection agency, did the aerial act, and
only his presence af mind and strong grip
saved him from broKen limbs at the least
calculation.
Meadows is assisting John C. Hughes,
the assignee of the insolvent concern, to
straighten out its affairs, and spends a
portion of each day in the factory. He
went there yesterday morning to see that
some electrical work was properly
done, and he took the workmen who had
been intrusted with the job in the freigh
hoist to show them the place where the
repairs were to be made.
The workmen, with their tool chests,
were taken up to the third story, where
all but Meadows alighted. The latter was
about to leave the elevator, when the
cage â either because it had been started
by some employe! below, or because the
machinery became derangedâ started
down.
Meadows seized the rope that operated
the steam power and attempted to stop
tue hoist, but'to his horror it refused to
work, and the elevator began to move
rapidly down, accelerating its. speed as it
descended.
Seeing a possibility of serious conse
quences, if he fell with the cage, Meadows
sprang at the rope and in an instant was
dangling in midair, the cage having fallen
from under him just as he made his leap.
He hune for an instant debating whether
to climb to the thiid story landing or to
slide to the bottom, end then concluded
to take the latter course.
The rope was small and gave him little
purchase, but he succeeded in reaching
i he bottom with nothing worse than badly
skinned hands and a scare that will last
him for many days.
The unmanageable elevator struck the
bottom with a resounding crash that
brought all the employes in the building
to tn* scene. The tool-chests were thrown
in all Directions and the jtools. scattered
about. The rope thct raised and lowered
the lift was thrown off its pulley by the
shock and the machine was generally
.shaken up.
Meadows was aple to slide down the
rope without serious accident from the
lact that he was a sailor for several years
and learned the manner in wnich mari
ner' go up and down fragile looking ropes
without apparent effort.
CHASED A PICKPOCKET.
Us Pursuit and Escape Caused Great
Excitement on Market
Street.
A well-dressed pickpocket mixed with
the crowd in the Chicago store, 1812 Mar
ket street, about 2 o'clock yesterday after
noon and caused the wildest excitement.
A lady felt his hand in her pocket and
when she saw her well-filled purse in the
grasp of the thief she tried to seize him
and screamed out that her purse was
stolen.
The thief with the purse in his hand
dasheil out of the store followed by some
of the clerks and customers and ran across
Market street ana down Seventh. The
pursuers yelled "Stop thief." and a young
man who was on Seventh street made a
rush for the thief and managed to catch
hold of him. There was a momentary
struggle and the thief broke away and
dashed east on Stevenson street.
Finding that his pursuers were gaining
on lam, and seeing a policeman at the
other end of Stevenson street, he ran into
a stp.bie and from it into the rear ot
Westerield's bakery, 1035 Market street.
He ran throuch the bakery and out into
Market street again, and all trace of him
W3s lost.
He was described as a man about 5 feet
10J4 inches tell, dark complexion, dam
mustache, and wore a blue sack coat and
dark troupers.
The lady who lost her pu;Se did not
return to the store, but went to police
headquarters and reporte.l the robb-ry of
her purse. The police refused to eive her
Dame snd address, and would not even
admit that she had reported the robbery.

A NEW POLICE STATION.
In AH Respects a Modern
Building lor Use by the
Department.
Growth of a Thriving Section of the
City MaJe Better Police Pro
tection Necessary.
The growth of the City westward of re
cent years has brought about the neces
sity for having a police station located in
a central section of this territory.
To meet this requirement Chief Crow
ley and Captain G. W. Wittman cast their
official eyes about in search of a suitable
site and found a piece of City property on
Police Station on CFarrell Street, Between Devisadero and Brod
erick, Now in Course of Construction for the Use of the
Western Addition.
the south side of Q'Farrell street, between
Devisadero and Broderick, which had not
been built upon. This suited the require
ments and permission to erect a police
j station was obtained and instructions
I given to Architect W. O. Banks to pre
| pare plans for a modern station, which he
aid, tne probable cost of the building to
be about $5000. These plans were ap
! proved by the Police Commissioners and
Chief Crowiey and Captain Wittman and
were turned over to Corporal George Rus
sell and his assistant, Officer B. Judge,
two practical mechanics of the depart
ment, under whose supervision the build-
Ing is now being erected by John McKay,
who obtained the contract for that pur
pose.
The lot has a frontage of 25 feet and a
depth of 90 feet, on which there will be a
two-story frame building with a side en
trance through which the patrol wagon
j will enter.
In the rear of the building will be a
stable with four stalls. The station proper
will contain on the ground floor the offices
of the sergeant, the prison-keepers and
such other minor quarters as may be
necessary. In the rear on this floor will
be nine cells. Two of these cells will be
u i -ed for drunks, vagrants and common
offenders, while alongside there will be
seven smaller cells for the use of offenders
whose crimes may be of greater magni
tude than that of misdemeanor.
The second floor will be used as an as
sembly room I'cr the men where those uni
form lockers, arms and Mich other articles
as are usually in use about a police sta
tion will be kept, with furniture suitable
for the men to use as a library or reading
room as they may desire. Electric lights
will illuminate the entire building.
The basement floor will be of concrete
witb a coat of bitumen spread over it
which will keep down the dampness and
give a solidl'.y to the entire structure.
It was originally the intention of Chief
Crowley to have attached to this station
one of the new City ambulances with an
attending physician who would always be
on duty to lock aiter such emergency
calls as might come in from that portion
of the City, but the funds at bis disposal
were too small, and to make up for itie
loss the Park Commissioner's volunteered
to erect suitable quarters in Golden Gate
Park for the accommodation of the emer
gency ambulance and the physician in
attendance.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 1897.
SOME NEW LAWS
FOR OUR MINERS
A Meeting at the Union
League Club in Their
Interest.
Friends of Assemblyman Power
Urging Hm for Chairman of
ths Committee.
The Legislature to B; Asked for
$250,000 for Impounding Dams and
$100,000 for a Horn?.
A meeting of the executive committee
of the California Miners' Association was
held last evening at the Union League
Club, to focus, so to speak, upon matters
of interest to the guild to be brought De
fore ihe Legislature at Sacramento.
A number of proposed laws have been
under discussion by the miners through
out the State, which were variously
deemed of importance.
These were submitted to Judge Hervey
Lindley, Superior Judge Bsicber and
other authorities, who were at the meet
ing, and in a general discussion gave
their opinions in regard to the proposed
bills. Some of the bills, as was pointed
out, were already covered by the Federal
laws.
Whatever may be- done with these bills,
as a result of the conference, there are two
others that were referred to which wiil cer
tainly be submitted to the Legislature for
passage. One of these asks an appropria
tion of $250,000 from the State to be added
to the National appropriation of the same
amount for the construction of impound
ing dams, and another asks for $100,000
for the founding of a home for oid and dis
abled miners.
President Jacob Neff presided and
Julian Sonntag served as secretary. There
were about twenty-five members present,
among them being: Colonel C. W. Keyea,
E. J. de Sabla, Tiray L Ford, Charles G.
Yale, Lewis Gerstle and W. W. Montague.
Besides tlie-e there was present an im
portant committee, consisting of Senator
W. F. Prisk of Nevadi County, Judge
Sawanl of Plumas, Assemblyman C. D.
Fontana of Calaveras, Assemblyman H. T.
Power of Placer and Assemblyman Robin
son of Calaveras. These gentlemen came
from Sacramento to confer informally
with the executive committee of the
Miners' Association in regard to the vari
ous legislation which is now of interest to
the miners. Their views were given with
more or less detail at the meeting.
Mr. Power is being actively pushed for
ward for the position of chairman of the
Committee on Mine* and Mining. He
has had a great deal of experience in the
mines, and his associates say there is not
a man in California who is better qualihed
for the place. Toe gentlemen who came
as an informal committee along with Mr.
Pcwer are working energetically for him.
"We are pushing him forward for the
place," said Assemblyman Fontana, "be
cause he represents th ; most oi the min
ing interests. He own mines, and has
been actively encaged in mining all his
lie. He is active also in the California
Miners' Association. He is now a mem bar
oi the executive committee of the ass cia
tion, is a member of the Committee on
Mineral Land I*,1 *, and isnlso a member of the
Committee on Mining Legislation. He wili
prove in all respects an admirable man for
the position. "
The members of the Assembly who
came down to attend the meeting and who
are advocating Mr. Power are from the
leading mining counties in the State, and
are membars of the California Miners'
Association.
DOG MEN GROWL.
The Pacific Kennel Club Ia Undecided
Concerning; the Holding of a
Bench Show.
The .Pacific Kennel Club held a very â
well, excitable, meeting Wednesday even
ing in a parlor of thr- Occidental Hotel.
H. Bier, tne president, called the meet
ing to order. Amonir the representatives
of the club who condescended to honor
the occasion by tlieir presence were: T. J.
Watson, E. Briggs, F. A. Busbnell, H.
Golcher, E. H. Wakemann, Horace Orear
and Clarence Haight.
The motion before "the house" of most
particular importance was whether the
Pacific Kennel Club intended to hold to
rether and give a bench show this year or
disband.
Some favored the idea of disbanding and
turning over the cash in the treasuryto
some charitable institution, while others
strenuously objecteJ to this proposition
and suggested mat the club amalgamate
with either the newly organized Olympic
Gun Club or the St. Bernard Club, and
that a show be held under the auspices of
the Pacific Kennel Club, which is the pa
rent body.
Motions of divers kinds were in order
and out of order, but finally the presi
dent, after unloading himself of a large
cargo of disgust, said that the chair could
not entertainâ with all due respect to the
representatives of the Kennel Club who
were present â any motion to disband, as
there was but a bare quorum present and
an act of that kind would be an injustice
to the members who were unable to at
tend.
Mr. Briggs moved that a committee of
three be appointed to lnteiview the offi
cers of the Olympic Gun Club ana the St.
Bernard Club and procure their views
relative to joining forces with the Pacific
Kennel Cinb with the object of giving a
bench show in this City this year.
The motion was duly seconded and
carried and Messrs. Briggs, Bushnell and
Haight were appointed a committee to
interview the officers of the clubs already
mentioned and report at a special meeting
of the Pacific Kennel Club, which will bs
held on Wednesday evening, the 20th
instant.
THE NEW MUSIC RIDE.
Ladies and Gentlemen Dance
the Quadrilles Prettily
on Horseback.
Now That the Riding Club Is a Suc
crss It Will Have an Iron
Home lor Horses.
It was another night for the horse,
another event in society circles, and it was
second only in point of general interest to
the horse show itself. The ladies were
there, of course, and the gentlemen with
them, and pood form appeared to be that
everything should be horsey and strictly
in Keeping with latest lashions. And the
band played melodious music, an accom
paniment, as it were, to the sper f.acle pre
sented. It was the first "music ride" of
the San Francisco Riding Club.
Since the club organized the members
have unselfishly devoted themselves to
developing it, with the result that the or
gan izatioa has grown into one of the
flourishing clubs of San Francisco. But
this process of development "went on
quietly until the progressive element be
gan to look around for noveltiesâ enter
tainments of a character that would
amuse members and guests and at the
same time make the club popular amoug
lashionable people who lean toward horse
bacfc riding. Various improvements were
thought out and last night the most suc
cessful event in the club's career was held.
The spacious hall that used to accommo
date two companies of National Guards
men at drill is now a riding-rim?, with a
thick floor of clay and tanbark and sides
bordered with sloping timbered walls to
prevent accidents to horses or riders. In
<he front is a commodious gallery for
spectators, and on the second floor a still
larger one. Last evening the galleries
were crowded and among these present
were several prominent men and leading
ladies in society. Not a lew handsome
costumes were seen among the ladies.
These music rides are decidedly new
here, nothing of the kind having been at
tempted before, at least in San Francisco.
In them society has found a new excite
ment, and to judge from last night's affa ir
invitations to future rid s will be in tre
mendous demand. The club has issued
many Invitations to music rides, which
are to be held at 8 o'clock every Thursday
evening during the season, and it is be
lieved that if many more fortunate pos
sessors of those tickets avail themselves of
this opportunity for enjoyment the rides
will have to be given in some very large
hall. For the present, however, it is
likely that the clubhouse will meet all de
mands upon its space.
Shortly after the appointed hour the
programme began last evenine. The or
chestra struck up a lively air and every
body started into the jing. Captain
Joseph Dilhan, late of the French army,
and now riding-master of the club, wns
there. Presently several members of the
club, ladies as well as gentlemen, entered
the ring on horseback. They saluted and
went through a serious of pretty evolu
tions, and iinal ly danced the quadrilles
and lancers. Tne spectacle was peculiarly
an attractive one, and the riders gave evi
dence of skill. At repeated intervals the
spectators applauded warmly, and at last
ihÂ« first musical ride was declared the
proper thing.
Between the acts an officer of the club
told his friends that arrangements had
been made to enlarge and improve the ac
commodations. A !oi on the west side of
the club buildin-;, and fxteriding back
from Pacific avenue 137:6 leet, has been
secured. At present there is a small
wooden stable upon part of this lot, but
it is to be removed immediately and re
placed by a corrugated structure, fireproof
throughout and fitted with most approved
appliances for stabling horses. The front
will be given some architectural beauty to
conform with the clubhouse, and the iron
stabie will coyer the whole lot. With a
row of stalls in thr clubhouse there will
be room for fifty horses when the new
stabies are built, und then the applicants
for places will become active members of
the club.
NEWS PROM RANDSBUBG.
A Chatty Letter on the Latest at the
New ('it in p.
The following letter from Randsburg
gives the latest news of the mining camp
in a concise and interesting style:
Randsbttrg, Dec. 29, 1896.
This Is a wild camp, composed of 242 tents,
mostly small ones, and 112 "shacks" and
"shanties," ranging from 6x6 feet to 20x60
feet. The largest are the daiicehouses, gro
ceries, hotels and lodging-houses. It is hard
i to get h bed in a comfortable place at any
price. Every kind of trade is amply repre
sented on a small scale except the gambling
houses and saloons, which are represented on
a scale out of. proportion to the number of the
inhabitants. More "shanties" are erected
every day, and it takes about two days' work
of two men to build one of them without plas
tering, ceiiin?s and with few windows.
1: is n minim.- camp in every respect except
I the mining pirt of it.
As there nre only about seventy-five men
employed in the mines out of about 1500 peo
ple the money to support the camp comes
mostly from outsiders coming and goin-^.
There are three stages from Mohave and two
from Kramer every day, besides many teams
haul In* lumber, supplies and water.
Very, little development work has been done
yet on the ciaims and mines, but or the
amount done there is au excellent showing of
rich, high-srade ore.
No miner or any one else who must have
immediate work to nve should come here, as
the camp is overstocked now.
Every foot of the surrounding country it
thki.-n up by claims, some two and three
deep. There is a prospect of lively limes in
settling up those claims.
There is a rival camp just over the hill east
of Randsburg named Johannesburg, an im
mense, high-sounding name lor a very small
camDOfa few scattered tents, in fact living
here is about like camping out on a vacant lot
in San Francisco surrounded by old tin cans
and without the comiorts of nice pave
ments, etc.

Mr. Varney said something should be
done toward making the theft of a bicycle
a felony. Supervisor Devany had spoken
to him regarding the matter and sug
gested that a bill be prepared and every
effort be made to have it passed at the
present silting of the Legislature.
Mr. Mohrig said that us the matter now
stood an old horse â a plug worth $5, or
even nothing â if stolen it was a felony,
whereas the theft of a bicycle worth $50 or
$100 was only a larceny.
"A bike is easily stolen," he added,
"and for that reason the act should be
punishable as a felony."
Mr. Upton of Sacramento said that the
bicycle-dealers of the capital city would
co-operate with a delegation froru San
Francisco in pushing the matter of a bill
through the Legislature. Tney could
count upon the assistance of Assembly
men Ennis and Sims, who were members
of bicycle clubs.
It was decided that tte matter would
be attended to and the bill be prepared.
The Cycle Board of Trade adjourned to
meet two weeks from that time.
COMPANY AS BEUNION.
All Living Members Gather Around
a Carapflre.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 7.â Company A,
Fifth Regiment, held a reunion and camp
fire to-night for the first time since its or
ganization over thirty years aco.
As many old members as are living of
the old guard were present, and the enter
tainment was of an enthusiastic nature.
The old guard has an interesting his
tory. At the beginning of the Civil War,
Oakland bad less than 2000 inhabitants.
But the patriotic feeling was so strong
that they decided to send a military com
pany to the front.
The company was organized and mus
tered into the California State Militia in
June. 1861, and later attached to ti.e Sec
ond Regiment of Artillery. When tb.9
National Guard was reduced in 1872, the
Oakland Guard was mustered out, but the
same evening mustered in again as an un
attached body.
A Patent Chalice.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 7.â The Rev. V^
Marshall Law has been granted a patent
on his communion cup. This chalice was
explained in detail several months ago,
and consists of a device by which each
person drinks at a different section of the
cup. It is claimed that its use does not
violate anything contained in the rubric
of the Episcopal prayer-book.
New Republican Club.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 7.â The young
Republicans of East Oakland organized
the Seventh Ward Club last night. JS. L.
Lawrence, A. A. Moore Jr., W. H. Me-
Grath, J. ri. Robinson and H. Tumsuden
were appointed a committee or. perma
nent organization. Henry A. Melvin, the
popular public prosecutor, will probably
be elected president.
Hayes Valley Koomii?g.
Hayes Valley has an improvement club, and
is going to have a fiesta. The first meeting of
the club was held last evening, and arrange
ments were made to have a big celebration
among the business men und property-owners.
Another meeting on the same subject will be
held on Monday evening next in Howry's
Opera-house on Grove and L'igiina streets.
Conviction of n Pickpocket.
Charles Ãbhaus was convicted of grand 1Â«

POLITICIANS ARE
MUCH INTERESTED
The Contest for Auditor
Between Dearie and
Broderick.
Nothing Wrong Disclosed in the
First Day of the Recount
Proceedings.
Peculiar Marks Interpreted by Judge
Trou'.t According to the Vot
er's Intention.
There was a crowd of interested politi
cians in Judge Troutt's department of the
Superior Court yesterday morning when
the contest of William A. Deane against
William Broderick for the office of City
Auditor was called for trial.
Mr. Deane smiled as he faced Mr. Brod
erick in the legal arena, and there was a
general sentiment among the crowd that
"May the best man win." In this case
the best man wiil be the one with the
greatest number of votes.
Attorney Garret McEnerney, represent
ing Mr. Broderick, objected to the open
ing of the ballots on the usual technical
grounds that tnere was nothing to show
jhat the ballots produced were the original
ballots, and that there is nothing on the
lace of the returns nor in the allegations
of the complaint filed by Mr. Deane to
warrant the court in ordering a recount of
the votes. â¦
Attorney William H. Schooler, speak
ing for Mr. Deane, drew attention to the
provisions of the code, which allow any
candidate an opportunity to have the title
â¢ of his opponent investigated by a court of
competent jurisdiction, and Judge Troutt
directed Registrar Hinton to produce a
package of ballots, with which command
tue Registrar complied, but he a:ked
to be excused fro;:i opening it.
The court appointed D. L. Conkling,
caller; William It. Joosr, am tiger; Joseph
McDonald, c.erk; James F. Leary, clerk;
H. W. Walter, official reporter.
JuJge Troutt look the clerk's shears and
severed the red tape that aad been placed
around ttie envelope containing the
ballots cast in the First Precinct of the
Forty-fifth Assembly District, broke the
seals and directed Caller Conkiing to pro
ceed.
In less than live minutes a contention
arose over the counting of a vote wuere
â  the cross mark had been careies-sly placed
by the e.ector. It seemed to be almost
equally divide 1 between Broderick and
Cuapman, being in fact on i c line divid
ing those two names. It was noi printed
squarely on tne paper. One arm of the x
invaded the square opposite JSroderick's
â¢ name, while the other part of the mark
was clearly in the field of the square
opposite Chapman's name, so a orief
â  argument ensued.
Mr. Schoolerâ We object to the ballot on the
ground that it is impos-ible to determine lrom
the face of the bullot whether the elector de
sired to vote for Broderick or Chapman.
Mr. McEnerneyâ We contend that it ought
to be counted for Mr. Kroderick.
Judge lroutt (alter inspecting the ballot)â
It seems to me that the greater part ot the
cross or murk is in the fquare opposite Brod
erick's name, though I must say that it is a
duubtful case. I desire to suggest in some of
. these disputed cases it may oe necessary to
reserve decision in order to give time for full
examination and consideration. However, iv
this instance I shall overrule Mr. Schooler's
objection and the vote will De counted for
Broderlck.
.Exception was noted by Deane's attor
ney, and tlip ballot was marked '"Dis
i. uted ballot No. L"
It was only a few minutes before an
other dispute arose because some one put
two marks on the balJot â one alter Chap
man and one after Deane. Mr. McEnerney ]
objected so the balJot while Mr. Schooler ;
resisted the objection.
Judge Troutt decided that the ballot
could not be counted, and it was marked |
"No. 2" on ;lie mv of disputed ballots.
There was yet. another ballot disputed j
by Mr. McEnerney on the ground that it
was not clearly intended for Deane, but
the court overruled the objection. Attiie
close of the count of the precinct it ap
peared that Deane had 71 vote.-" and Brode
rick 72, a gain of one vote for Deane.
In the succeeding precincts there was
no material change. The record Ji>r the
day was as follows: First Precinct, Deane
gained one; Second, no change; Third,
Wool Association, and every County Clerk in
the State for Boards of Supervisors.
Chairman Craig in his opening address
furnished strong illustration of the neces
sity of protecting American industries.
He stated that Mexico and Australia are
as dangerous as countries lying across the
Atlantic, and called the attention of his
auditors to certain articles manufactured
there at a cost with which local manufac
turers could not hope to compete.
At the conclusion of Mr. Craig's address
several letters wera read from persons ap
proving both for themselves and for
others the idea of a high protective tariff.
Acknowledgment of invitations and cre
dentials for delegates were received from
many organizations, the most important
of which were as follows:
The Los Acsreles Board of Trade, the Hum
boldt Chamber of Commerce, American Pro
tective Tariff League. State Horticultural So
ciety, OiitÃrio Fruit Exchange, State Board of
Horticulture, Santa Cruz Board of Trade, San
Francisco Board of Trjide, Ban Francisco Fruit
Exchange, Dairymen's Union, Contra Costa
Fruit Union, Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association of California, State Board of Trade,
California Wool Association, Produce Kx
chango of San Francisco, Builders' Exchange
of San Francisco, Manufacturers' Association
oi California.
It was moved by Julian Sonntag that
five members be appointed a "committee
on report," to which, shoula be referred
all resolutions and suggestions, tlie mat
ters in question to be Drought before the
conference and finally before the Com
mittee on Ways and Means at Wushing
ton. The motion prevailed, and a com
mittee v;as appointed in the persons of
Julian Sonntag, C. H. Abbott, P. B. Corn
wall, N. P. Chipnian and E. M. Herrick.
The following resolution was offered by
the San Francisco Chamber oi Commerce
and carried :
Resolved, That in arranging a new tariff the
California delegation in Congress is respect
iully urged to procure the free entry or taking
out bond of all materials actually used for
construction, repairs, equipment or subsist
ence oÂ£ American-built ships iv the foreign
trade.
In behalf of the California Wine Pro
ducers' Association, A. bb&rboro of
fered a resolution that a duty of 50
cents per gallon be imposed on still
wines. A general discussion followed, in
which Colonel Trevillian supported the
resolution, while General N. P. Chipman
wanted it modified. The latter advocated
a difference in the duticj on different
wines, and proposed a duty of $3 a case on
champagne,. The resolution was adopted
as amended.
J. E. Jansen, representing the Hum
boldt Chamber of Commerce, offered a
resolution advocating a restoration of the
rates of the McKinky tariff bill on wool,
hair, shoddy cloth, "rags, fruits, agricul
tural productions and livestock, all but
the last to be subject to the schedule of
1890. He also wanted fruit to De subject
to such modifications as may be deemed
most beneficial by the fruit-growers and
farmers of other parts of the State, and
Deane and Broderick gained one each;
Fourth, Brodericlv gained one; Fifth,
Broderick gained one; Sixth, no change;
Seventh, no change; Eighth, no change.
In the E ghth Precinct of the Forty
fifth Assembly District a peculiar state of
affairs was disclosed. A ballot came out
marked from top to bottom with purple
blotches where the aniline stampings
ought to have appeared. In the matter of
Auditor a blotch appeared opposite Brod
ericks name, and Mr. Schooler objected
on the ground that no siamp had Deen
used by the voter, as required by law.
Judge Troutt said the intention of the
voter was clear, and it was his duty to re
spect that intention.
Mr. MrEncney added that the reverse
end of the stamp was vrobably used or
the official stamp might have been mis
laid, to the vote was counted for Brod
erick.
A lew minutes later a similar ballot ap
peared marked in the same way for Deane,
and the court decided to foliow the ap
parent intention of the voter, even though
he did not use a good stamp.
Attorne3' Schooler said the friends of
Mr. Deane were not in any way moved by
the result of the day's recount. It was
not expected that there would be material
chances in the precincts from whicn early
reports were received. If any bad errors
had been made it was expected that they
would come from the jrecinctÃ where the
reports were delayed.
The count will be taken up again next
Monday morning, and Judge Troutt an
nounced that he intends to devote ten
hours a day to the work. He has post
poned all other business until that is con
ciuded. The lawyers in the case declared
tliaÂ» they would bi pleased to have the
matter expedited.
SOLD TO SPECULATORS.
The Town of Klko, Nev., Parts Comp
any With the Kail
way.
W. H. Mills, land agent of the Central
Pacific Railway, closed ona of the most
unusual of bargains Monday last. Many
transactions of varied character have
passed through his hands, bat this one,
he freely admits, is an oddity in the sale
of land. It is the sale of a town site, or,
rather, the rest of a town that _ was once
divided into numerous lots, but never was
i sold.
I "We sold 700 lots in the town of E'ko,
Nev.." he said. "Not a square foot of
ground iv that town was sold for fourteen
years before. Elko had the making of a
town in it years ago. It had the Nevada
Normal School and some business bouses,
but as a town it never amounted to any
thing. Its population now is only a few
hundred people, and so you may see that
the sale of the town is a matter of consid
erable interest in Nevada. The fact of the
purchase is proof that somt. industrial re
vival is imminent in the vicinity of Elko.
*'H. J. Mayham ol Denver was nere Mon
day, and it was he who bought the town
.Â«i;e of Elko. He represented a company
wnich he said had the backing of Eastern*
capitalists. This company has developed
mining properties on â  large scale ai a
point about seventy miles north of Elko.
The mines are said to be rich and to have
abundance of water for motive power and
washine. Tb-yare situated on the south
erly line of Idaho, but in tne State of
Nevada. The company is going to irri
tate considerably, and that is what we
are interested in, though as a matter of
course mining would bring the road busi
ness worthy of consideration."
The mining company has issued an
elaborate prospectus with illustrations
showing where mines can be established,
etc., also pictures of dams and water
works and a new town.
TROUBLES OP THE ELKS.
James P. Dunne and His Companions
File Their Answer.
Attorney Percy Long yestprday filed the
answer of James P. Dunne, C. W. Nevin,
J. R. Howell and Alfred Perrier to the
complaint brought against them in the
name of Golden Gate Lodge tf the Order
of Elks.
On account of dissensions in the organ
ization its charter was declared forfeited,
and Grnfld Exalted Ruler M. D. Detweiler
demanded ail (ho property of the lodge.
Mr. Dunne and his associates, as mem
bers of the board of trustees, delivered the
property in obedience to Mr. Detweiler's
order, and some of the mem hers of the
lodge objecting to this course instituted
the action here mentioned.
The answer sets upas a defense that the
defendants simply performed their duty
in delivering the property to Mr. Det
weier, and that he took the chattels and
funds baCK lo Harnsburg, Pa. The ques
tion of ownership is to be referred to the
next Grund Council of the order. Inas
much as the complaining members failed
to refer their dispute to the proper tribu
nals in the organization of the Elks it is
contended that they had no legal standing
in court.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 1897.
thought that wherever it was practicable
a return should be made from ad valorem
to specific duties.
There was a diversity of opinions on
this subject. T. C. WiliiamÃ of the Red
wood Lumber Company presented a reso
lution placing a duty of $2 per thousand
feet on all foreign importations of white
and sugar pine, Douglas fir, redwood,
spruce, etc. The suggestion was indorsed
by the conference.
An adjournment of the general confer
ence was then taken to Saturday morning
at 10 o'cloct, but the committee on report
convened immediately. Several repre
sentatives of the wool men were given a
bearing first.
Their ideas on the tariff varied slightly,
but they at last reached the harmonious
conclusion that a tariff on foreign wool
not less than that laid down in the Mc-
Kinley tariff bill would be entirely satis
factory.
John Swett, in behalf of the Contra
Costa Fruit Union, wanted a rate of 2)4
cents a pound on foreign grapes. He
mentioned the fact that $1,000,000 worth
of the El Maria variety alone was imported
annually, besides great quantities of
Malagas.
The committee then toofe a recess until
1:30 p. m., at which time it assembled with
Julian Sonntag as chairman.
B. N. Rowley read a letter from cocoa
nut dealers, asking for a iree admission to
American ports of cocoanuts, but a tariff
on all food substances manufactured
therefrom.
He was followed by Mr. Lindsay, repre
senting the San Mateo County lumber
industry. His ideas of a suitable tariff
coincided with those of his predecessor of
the morning session.
One of the most interesting subjects
coming before the committee was the
question of a tariff on grain It was
introduced by J. Y. Millar, secretary of
the California Cotton Mills, located in
Oakland.
"We are concerned," he said, "more in
the manufacture of burlaps than of grain
bags. Ii grain bags were placed upon the
free list it is inevitable that in time bur
laps will be also.
"I think the abolition of the manufac
ture of grain baijs at San Qnentiu would
solve the question. . This country can
produce all the jute necessary for our own
use, and there is no need of importing
much from Calcutta, anyway."
Ex- Mayor Fond, George W. McNearand
Dr. Dickinson also took part in the dia
cussion. They believe that, as California
farmers are the only men making any use
of grain bags it would be a great injustice
to increase their expense, overburdened as
they arc already.
The matter was discussed at some
length, the committee freely questioning
the debaters. The meeting linally ad
journed till to-day at 10 a. m. To-morrow
the committee will report to the general
conference and a report to send to the
Committee on Ways and Means at Wash
ington will be drawn up.
MANY MEN WILL
BE UNEMPLOYED
A Big Cut Made Necessary
in the Street De- '
partment.
Laborers Must Give Way to
Cover Recently Awarded
Contracts.
A Legacy Left by the Retiring Board
of Supervisors to the Street
Superintendent. :
At the very outset of his administration
Superintendent of Streets Ambrose will
be compelled to cut down his force of
laborers on the public streets in order to
prevent overdrafts on the funds of the
Street Department
It has not yet been decided how many
men will be laid off because it is not
known just how tne financial problem
stands, but the reduction wiil be at least
one-quarter of the regular force to start
with, and perhaps more as the matter is
better understood. This means that from
twenty-five to fifty men will be out of em
ployment until the Auditor is satisfied
that the approprfation is in proper con
dition.
The reason of the shortage is that the
late Board of Supervisors made contracts
in excess of the appropriation and that ex
penditures must be held down so as to
keep within the law. When the old board
had finished sending down warrants for
the payments of completed work mere
was only $500 le.'t in the fund. This on
thefaceot.it made tne appearance that
the street funds were in good condition,
but the contracts that had already been
awarded placed a different complexion on
the matter.
It was lound that on December 21 E. G.
Keen was awarded a contract for paving
Folsom street at $12,000, and that one Mc-
Laren had been allowed $500 for plans for
tift laying out of A.amo square.
In addition to this a contract for grad
ing on Uernal Heights was let, the total
amount being not less chan $13,500, and
probably mucu more than that.
As but $500 whs left for the new board to
Handle, ii was evident that a cut must be
made somewhere, and the $200,000 of tne
street funds appropriated for ttie keeping
in repair of accepted streets was selected
for the sacrifice.
The monthly payroll of the Street De
partment lor laborers on the streets
amounts to about the sum of the excess
contracts, ho that at least one month must
be saved u> make up the deficiency. Su
perintendent of Streets Ambrose admitted
yesterday that such was the case.
In addition to the shortage that will
occur in the funds mentioned, the pay
roll of the Street Superintendent's depart
ment for December lias not yet been pre
sented, and these demands will probably
result in a temporary hold-up by Auditor
Broderick.
THE BELPOBD'S OEEW.
A Statement That There Was No Diffi
culty With the Men.
Regarding the account of a difficulty be
tween the master and crew of the Belford
last Wednesday regarding their advance
Captain W. C. McKinnon of theshipstates
that the report is incorrect.
In a letter to The Call, Captain McKin
non says: "My new crew appears to be
satisfied with me, and I am certainly sat
isfied with them in every respect. The
men got what little advance they required
before coming aboard, and then they went
to work cheerfully. If this is a 'scab
crew' I will never take any oiher kird to
sea with rue. There was no trouble aboard
ol my ship w atcver. "
The Belford has gone to sea, but this
statement is made for Captain MrKinnon.
Mute ZoUing Protests.
Several days ago the local Board of Inspec
tors of Steam Vessels revoked the licenses of
Captain William Smith and First Officer Rich
ard /oiling of the ill-fated steamer San Benito,
which was wrecked recently three miles north
of Point Arena. The board decided that both
officers were careless and negligent in handling
the vessel. Mate Zolling is not satisfied to
have his license revoked aad he has appealed
from the decision to United States Supervising
Inspector Bermiugham, the highest authority
iv such matters.
LAWYERS GIVE AND
TAKE HOT SHOT
G. D. Shadburne and W.
H. H. Hart Exchange
Challenges.
Judge Ccffey Exercised His Au
thority and Prevented
Trouble.
Both Apol-oziz d to the Court, but Not
to Each Other-A Hostile Meet
ing Was Averted.
There was a prospect of a lively row in
Judge Coffey's court Wednesday when At
torney George D. Shadburne and ex At
torney-General W. H. H. Hart clashed
over a definition of gentlemanly conduct.
For twenty-one afternoons the contest
over the estate of the late Dr. Charles A.
James, who left $30,000 worth of property,
j has been on trial in Judge Coffey's court.
A great deal of ill temper has been evinced
on the part of trie lawyers becauso Mr.
Shadbnrne has repeatedly announoed
â¢hat there is a conspiracy on foot to ob
tain the entire estate for Mrs. Laura Milen
James and her child, to the exclusion of
the relatives of the decedent.
Mrs. James claims to be the widow of
Dr. James and has produced a document
which purports to be a marriage contract.
This paper has been attacked by Mr.
Shadburne, who does not think it genu
ine.
The child of Mrs. James was exhibited
in court yesterday afternoon and Mrs. Lu
e!la Oireil Milen, wife of Dr. Theodore
Milen, stepmother of Mrs. James, was
asked to point the resemblance of the
child to the late Dr. James. Taking in
hand a photograph of Dr. James, the wit
ness began by saying that the child has
blue eyes, reddish- brown hair, a high
brow, full eyes with heavy lines under
them, a small dimple in the chin and
short chubby hands.
"Is that why you say the child resem
bles Dr. James?" asked Mr. Shadburne.
"Well, tatten all in all, I think there
was a resemblance."
"Would not that description refer to any
gentleman in the room as well as it would
to Dr. James? 1 '
"I can't say tnat it would."
"Now, take General Hart, for instance;
hasn't he a nigh forehead?"
"Yes."
"And full eyes?"
"Yes."
"And heavy lines under the eyea?"
"Yes."
"And brown reddish, hair or reddish
brown hiir?"
"I can't say."
"Because General Hart has a beard
which would hide the dimple on his chin
if he had one is that why you say this
child doesn't resemble him?"
"No."
Mr. Shadburneâ Your honor, I ask Gen
eral Hart be requested to part his whis
kers in order to disclose whether or not
he has a dimple on his chin. [Turning to
Mr. Hart] Will you do so, General?
Mr. Hart (sternly)â l will not.
Mr. iSbadburneâ General Hart has short
chubby hands, has he not?
The witness â I don't know.
Mr. Hart's hands were deep in his trou
sers pockets, and he glared fiercely as Mr.
Snadburne turned to him and said:
"General, will you please exhibit to the
court your short chubby hands?"
Mr. Hart did not remove his hands
from his pockets, but looking up at Mr.'
Shadburne he savajrejy hissed, "Now. bee
here, Shadburne, if you want anything at
my hands you can get it outside the court
room in any way you want it."
"My dear general," began Mr. Shad
burne.
"Don't yon 'Dear general me,' " shouted
Mr. Hart. ''You heard what I said, and it
goes."
"When it comes to that, you don't have
to go anywhere to gi-t what you want out
of me," blurted out Mr. Shadburne, in
turn showing the heat of anser, towering
above his antagonist like Fitzsiminons
above Shark ey.
Judge Coffey had for several seconds
been trying to call the bellicose lawyers to
order by commanding tbem Doth to cease
the discussion, at the same time firmly
announcing tuat he would have no more
of such nonsense.
"I only meant to compel this person to
ask his questions in a gentlemanly way,"
snarled Mr. Hart.
"I always act in a gentlemanly way even
if he can't understand it, and I'll compel
the attorney on tne other side to treat me
right whether he wants to or not," replied
Mr. Shad bur ne.
It really looked as if a fight was about to
be precipitated, but the Judge brought
quiet out of chaos by compelling bom
lawyers to sit down, and a recess was
taken to allow the child to draw its quart-'
turn of sustenance from a bottle while
held by its mother on the witness-stand,
an extra chair being placed by the side of
the witness, Mrs. Milen, for that purpose.
Both lawyers apologized to the court,
but not to each other, so there may be
more trouble.
Mrs. Miien was compelled to tell the
story ol her life and te-explain the manner
in which she instructed her stepdaughter
Laura. She said she had not approved of
the mainage of Laura to Dr. James, be
cause she was not in robust health, but as
the girl was of age and Dr. Milen did not
object she, as the girl's stepmother, did
not interpose her opposition.
Mrs. Laura Milen James previously
gave in extenuation of all the circum
stances that occurred previous to her mar
riagfl ami told wuat happened in the
household day by day from the time she
met Dr. James until his death. She admit
ted that the henvy gold band which the
doctor gavfc her on uieir wedding day was
taken back by the doctor subsequently, as
it was too big for her, and he promised to
hay-- it made smaller, but died before it
was changed. She had not eeen it since,
but supposed it was in the hands of the
Public Administrator, as that officer took
ail the jewelry. She also admitted that
several of the dresses given to her by Dr.
James were formerly worn by the first
Mis. James, and tbat they had to be fixed
before they would tit her.
Mr. Hart announced that he expected to
close the testimony in favor of his client's
claim in the next two days.
At the adjournment of court Mr. Shad
burne was escorted from the new City Hall
by his friends, while Mr. Hart was at
tended by bis client and her stepmother,
so a hostile meeting between tne angry
lawyers was for the time averted.
ANNIE PICKET! IN PRISON.
The Notorious Pickpocket la Chitrged
With Grand Lurceny.
Annie Pickeit, the notorious pickpocket
who was arrested in Sacramento Wednes
day, was brought from there yesterday
morning by Policeman Al Wright and
booked at the City Prison on the charge of
grand larceny.
She and Mamie Bonner, another notori
ous pickpocket, are accused of robbing
George Hill, a visitor from the East, of
$400 in Â» saloon on O'Farrell street on the
nifrhtof December 7. Mamie lionner has
not yet been arrested.
Annie was some weeks ago sentenced to
six months fur vagrancy. She, through
her attorney, moved for a new trial, which
was refused, and then notice of appeal was
given and she was released on bonds. On
December 19 the Superior Court granted
her a new trial, but nothing further was
heard of the case.
Attempts were made yesterday to get
her out on bonds, but they were unsuc
cessful.

A report -,vas made to the board by Superin
tendent King upon the present condition of
the streets.
The request of the Merchants' Association to
have the two blocks on Stockton street from
Ellis to O'Fam'll and on Geary from Kearny
to Grant avenue, now paved with cobbles, re
paved in a modern manner was favorably
passed upon by the Board of Supervisors. As
soon as sufficient subscriptions are received
from the property-owners along the other
downtown cobbled blocks the Merchants' Asso
ciation will request the Board of Supervisors
to proceed with the repavement of the addi
tional blocks now pHved with cobbles. â 
The secretary reported that the latest char
ters had been received from the following
cities: Greater New \ork, Philadelphia, Chi
cago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Buffalo, Washing
ton, Rochester, S;. Paul and Kansas City.
Copies of the new charter of Seattle, as well as
ol the civil service rules and regulations, have
also been received. A very interesting com
munication was read to the board from Cor
win S. Shank, a prominent attorney of Seattle.
Regarding the better lighting of the City
211 electric arc lights have been ordered in
stalled upon twenty-one different streets of
the city. The board of directors expects the
effect of this better illumination to be so bene
ficial that the City authorities will continue
this excellent improvement after the present
fiscal year.
The board decided to hold the next quarterly
meeting on Thursday evening, January 14, at
the Academy of Sciences Hall, 819 Market
street. A number of important subjects will
be considered nt this quarterly meeting, es
pecially relating to legislation needed for Sun
Francisco and a system of better sewerage for
the City.
HAD AMPLE FUNDS.
The Larkin-Streer Celebration "Was a
Decided Success.
The Larkin-street Improvement Club
at its meeting last night received and
audited the celebration committee's ac
count as rendered by Dr. E. E. Hill, the
chairman of that committee, and found
that $114 bad been subscribed by the mer
chants and business men on the street
over which the arc lights have been sus
pended.
The sum of $116 had been used on the
night of the grand opening, all of which
was satisfactorily expended in the interest
of bringing Larkin street into prominence
as a central business locality.
Treasurer W. T. Kibbler reported that
the requisite funds were iorthcoming on
demand to meet the lighting fund for the
next six months. The committee on
streetcar transfers with the Sutler-street
and the lines running east and west acrc-a
Larkin street reported that it had not yet
succeeded in bringing about the desired
object, but had reason to believe that
satisfactory arrangements would event
ually be made. The question of Having
Larkui street repaved was discussed, but
no decision was reached. The committee
on street improvement was granted further
lime in winch to agitate this question with
the property-owners anU the Supervisors.

rested on December 20, for robbing A. W.
Forbes, 447 Fifth street, of a watcli and chain
and $15, was yesterday held to answer before

BIG NEW THEATER
AND ROOF-GARDEN
Planning a Playhouse to
Seat Over Three Thou
sand.
Nearly Consummated Several
Months Ago and Yet in
Prospect.
Five-Story Building Costing $150,000
Located Near Market and
Powell Streets.
Plans are afloat for the erection some
where in the neighborhood of the junction
of Powell and Market streets of a very
large theater, the seating capacity of
which will warrant the appearance here
of such big troupes as the Metropolitan
ODera Company and others needing stage
accommodations for as many as 200 per
formers at one time.
Tne idea also includes en extensive rooi
garden after the style of Hammerstein's
Olympia in New York. The garden would
be covered with glass roof, from which
the panes of giass could in sections be slid
aside to permit of almost no covering on
favorable nights. Id foggy weather pro
tection could be assured by closing the
overhead openings.
For over a year now the scheme has
been thoughtfully discussed by its pro
moters. The consummation of the plan
was prevented some months ago by the
sudden death of M. J. Keating, an old
mining man of Virginia City, who had
just agreed to erect a building for the pur
pose on property belonging to him on
Ehis street, above Powell. Plans for the
building had been adopted, .but the pas
sage of the estate into the possession of
the heirs interfered with the 'project and
for some time it has been awaiting a fa
vorable opportunity for revival.
When John B. Schoeffel of Abbey,
tichoeffel & Grau was out here in October
he wasvery favorable to the contemplated
enterprise. It was then practically settled
that the great opera company should come
here, and a contract was drawn for that
purpose in anticipation of the establish
ment of a mammotli new theater. Abbey
died, and the immediate consummation of
the enterprise was prevented.
"But it will come; it is bound to come,"
said Jake Goltlob, one of the managers of
the Columbia, yesterday.
"San Francisco needs something of the
kind. It needs a theater that can seat at
least 3500 people. In order to stage the
biggest operas and attractions like Irving
and Terry there must be room for a big
house to make it pas'.
"The building that Mr. Friediander and
myself had in contemplation was one
that would cost in the neighborhood of
$150,000. It would be four or live stories
in height and have a roof garden. Of
course the building proper would be cut
up into offices and the ground floor front
would be used for stores.
"While absolutely nothing is being
done by us at present toward consum
mating our long cherished plan we are
keeping a lookout. Some steps may be
taken soon after Mr. Friedlander's return
Irom Portland next Thursday."
DIEEOTORY SWINDLE.
E." P.' Dewey Held to ; Answer on the
' Charge of forgery. .
v.E. P. Pewey was yesterday held by
Judge Conlan to answer before the Supe
rior Court hi $2000 bonds on the charge of
forgery. . . 'â â ",' .
- Dewey and a man named Harris are
connected with a gang ot swindlers) hav
ing their headquarters in New York, who

COLD
CURE.
Colds lead to coughs, coughs to PneuÂ«
monia and Consumption; therefore, it ii
ill important to check a cold before ii
reaches the lungs. Munyon's Cold Cure
will positively break a cold inside oJ
twenty-four hours. Old colds," new colds
and obstinate colds cuied in a few hours.
When the cold reaches the lungs or bron-
chial tubes the Cough Cure should be used
alternately every half hour with the Cold,
Cure. The Cold Cure is guaranteed to pre-
vent pneumonia if used in the beginning
of a cold. Pneumonia, or inflammation
of the luns:s, can be controlled by the use
of these two cures. â

rainfall, of melted snow in Inches and hnndredtbs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south alone the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in iht> vicinity of Idaho, and
(he pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result,

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. -The stock mar
ket, while irregular to-day,on the whole displayed
more strength than on any previous day of the
week. It successfully withstood a further sharp
decline in Delaware, and Hudson const quent upon
the action of the directors of the company yester
day in reducing the dividend rate for the current
year from 7 to 5 per cent, and also a spell of
marked weakness in some of the industrials and
the coalers. Delaware and Hudson .'fell 2% io
1103, i and finally rallied to 11214. Jersey Central
and Heading sympathized to the extent of 134 and
C /rt per cent respectively, but the former partially
recovered and the latter fully made up the lots
before the session closed. Among the industrial
Ltather preferred broke 2Vi to 581/8 and Tobacco
yieldeJ 1 per cent.
Sugar was exceedingly irregular, although it
fluctuated within a range of about 1 per cent and
cosel li/ij lower than last night. Although the
street is attaching more and more importance to
the war between the trust an! ArbucUe Bros., the
reports current in regard thereto fail to simulate
any particular activity in the shares. The list
improved i/i to 11/s P' cent, the Grangers, Chi
cago Gas, Louisville and Nusuvilie, General B ec

During the afternoon the advance was partially

CHICAGO MAItKtTS.
CHICAGO, lll..' Jan. 7.â Wheat was in a more
deliberate state to-day than yesterday. At the
opening the probability that sellers had been a bit j
I too enthusiastic received some consideration, but
on second thought It was believed they had not,
an* another drive at prices was made. When a
decline of %c from the opening, or a net loss of
Vie from yesterday's close, had been established
there developed a firmer feeling and prices again
roje to the opening figures. Uncertainty prevailed
subsequently, the break of the past three aays
rather tending to cause sellers to act with caution,
whereas, on the other hand, the bulls were far
from confident. Liverpool cables quoted %d de
cline, which was equal to but one-half of our loss
yesterday. '
Receipts in the Northwest were light at 209
cars, against 261 last Thursday, and 538 on tne
corresponding day a year ago. Chicai-o received

The â  London Daily News ) says that in
England , the whole theory ol the day 8
meals -is % being altered. Business men
now make their lunch in the city practi
cally a dinner, take a certain amount of
rest after it, and the close of business go
home to a liehter supper. Among those
who maintain the old order of things the
dinner hour is earlier than formerly. ;In
the West and South in this country the
favorite practica is to have dinner at mid
day or early in the ' afternoon, and it is
observable in New York that many Jersey
commuters get their. big meal of the day
at noon, after the style of the London
business man.â New York World.

AND HIS HOME
Solomon Baumgarten Wants
the Governor to
Aid Him.
Imagines That the Lccal Courts
Will Not Accord Him
Justice.
O^ce Comparatively Rich Hs Now
Says He Is Forced to Live in
a Barn.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
008 Broadway, Jan. 7. j
Old Solomon Baumgarten declares that
he has been robbed of his wife and his
home and that his life is now i:i danger
from his many enemies. Mr. Baumgarten
has been a litigant on one &ide or the
other in scores of petty criminal and civil
cases, and he now declares that his ruin
is accomplished and that he has not a
place to lay his head.
"For twenty years," said Baumgarten
to-day, "I have lived in a house near
Third and Broadway that I oought with
liaru-earned money. Some time ago my
wife decided to leave me and in some
manner she obtained my signature to a
deed-of the property. I certainly did not
know that I was giving away my home,
and I now find tbat I have been com
pletely undone and that I have nowhere
to live, while another man draws rents
from my property. I have been perse
cuted for several years, and as a result
have been unable to look after my family*.
My first wife got a divorce from me on a
Jewish holiday when I was not present,
and now 1 am unable to support my ten
children.
. "After the divorce she married her friend, j
Mr. Pantosky, and now he has the deed '
to my property and receives the rents ;
from it while I live in a barn. About two i
years ago I married a young woman and j
we have one child, but we are not living
together for my enemies separated us. i
They influenced her with tales about me j
that wert- not true, and rinally I was ar- j
re-ted for cruelty to her and fined and â 
imprisoned and now I have nothing. My j
first wife has Eone, my property has gone, ,
my second wife has gone, and, not being !
able to properly look alter my family, one !
of the boys lives in a barn, another is in
jail, and I, who am now 69 years of age,
am left to die in raps and misery. I in
tend to plate my case directly before the
Governor and ask him to aid me. I was
arrested once by ti.e police without a
â¢warrant, which was illegal, and last Satur
day nitÂ»nt some of my enemies, who wish
to drive me away, came and threw big
rocks througn the broken windows of the
hovei in which I am forced to live. Ii
there ia any more trouble that can fall to
my share I would like to know what it is."
For several years there has been a feud
between the Baumgartens and the Pan
tosky?, and in almost every conflict the
Pantoskys seemed to have come oat the
victors. Certainly old Baamgarten is in
a very pitiable plight, but the evidence at
the time he was arrested for cruelty to his
wife was not oi ?uch a nature as to draw
fÂ«rth public sympathy. Ths reason that
he is drawing up a petition to Governor
Budd is, so he says, t:iat when he has had
legitimate ground of action in the local |
court, prejudice has prevented him ob- I
taining a lair show. In one case he tound j
when he got to court that he had em
nloved the same attorney that was ap
pearing for Pantosky, and his old enemy
won, as usual.

GILLAM LOSES MONEY.
Sold Assigned Claims One Day lie

Valuable.
ALAMEDA, Cai*, Jan. 7.â At least one
Alameda man ia sorry that the fee bill was
held to be valid by the Supreme Court.
John Glllam bad bougnt un $1600 worth of
claims of Constables Van Kapff and Day
or $800. He became weary of waiting !or
a decision and on Monday sold the wnoie
- batch for $800 and lost the use of the
money for months. The decision in his
favor came Tuesday, and now Gillam is
mad.
Last week the constables held a meeting
â¢in Hay wards and decided to let the htiga
. lion co and appeal to the Legislature. It
was then Mr. (iillara got frightened and
let. go. His biils were presented to the
Board of Supervisors and cut to aggregate
$800. They were then passed, and now
Mr. Gillam believes luck is against him.

ENOUGH LEFT TO QUARREL.
iJeinocrrttH Take the tsual Coune to
Attract Attention.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 7.â A neat little
row has cropped out among tbe two war
ring factions of the Democracy. There is
nothing new in the situation, only that
with a municipal electon in prospect the
old animosities have Leen revived. . What
is known as the Fitzgerald wing claim
that the followers of F. J. Moffltt tried to
capture the party machinery for the pur
pose of nominating delegates to tvÂ« con-
Ten tion.
Mr. Moffitt said to-night that he is
taking no interest in city politics, and
that all reports concerning hi* doings are
the result of Lis enemies' imaginations.
It it were not for these occasional squab
bles there would be no evidence that t lie
Democratic party had any footing in this
city.
GIVEN A COLD FROST.
Berkeley Football Men Subordinated
to Whittier Reform School
Lads.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 7.â The last of
the university football team, which went
south during the early part of the present
midyear vacation, returned to-day. They
all report having had an extraordinarily
delightful time everywhere they went.
Dinners, parties and receptions were ten
dered to them in great numbers. The
fourteen men who composed the comple
ment of ptayer3 were: Kansome, Haskell,
McNutt, Hall, Sherman, Kennedy, Craig,
Mclsancs, Avery, LudJow, Castlehun, Hop
per, Walithall. S|>ence and Anderson.
They were successful in defeating every
team they went against, bat the game
with the Whittle? lleform School boys
was won only by a very close margin, the
contest resulting in a score of 10 to in
favor of Berkeley. ' The team defeated the
Los Angles Athletic Club eleven by a
scorn of 14 to 0; the San Bernardino High
School team, 38 to 0; and the San Diego
team, 50 to 0.
One incident on the trip which went
very much against their grain was the fact
that in their contest with the Wbittier
School team the Los Angeles contingent
yelled for the Reform School lad?. "The
cold frost we got on that day,' remarked
one of the players to-day, "chilled us to the
marrow. We were smitten on both cheek?.
It was not enoueli for the Los Angeles
crowd to yell for the half-convicts, but
they also gave us a good leaving alone.
The result of the game, which was almost
a defeat, was lamely dvÂ« to the lack of
support we received from the grand stand."

BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 7.â The Cali

CHRISTIAN SOCIALISM.
Rev. W. D. P Bliss' Lecture in
St. Mark's Church,
Berkeley.
Religion, He Slid, Should Enter Into
A 1 the Affairs of Our
Lives.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 7.â Rev. W. D.
P. B iss, the Christian Socialist from Bos
ton, delivered a lecture at St. Mark's
Episcopal Church tnis evening, in which
he set forth his views as to the relation of
Christianity and socialism one to the
other. At the outset he reviewed the his
tory of the Christian social unions in
England and in the United States, and
then pointed out the distinction between
the" organization which he represented
and the other social institutions as they
are popularly known. He dwelt on
Christ's kingship over social, political
and industrial as well as religious institu
tions.
"Religion," said the speaker, "should
enter all our practical affairs of life. In it
we find the solution of all our practical
problems. The doctrine of Christ's king
ship over life is not applicable merely to
religious thoughts and feelings, but to
politics, to social life and to industrial
pursuits." Dr. Blis3 reviewed the rela
tions of labor and capital, vigorously ob
jecting to the unfairness of a contest be
tween the latter, combined and organized,
and tne former unable to combine for pro
tection.
He declared the questions involved to
be moral and not political or economic.
Individual righteousness in the commer
cial world was said to be impractical, and
hence the necessity of social and political
recognition of the great Christian teach
ing of human brotherhood.
"We of the purchases forget tie social,"
s-aid the speaker, "and devote thought too
much to the idea of the individual getting
to heaven. It is this spirit, this lack of
moral appreciation of the real heart of
Christian doctrine, tnat keeps working
men from the churches, for they do not
see in the lives of members exemplifica
tion of the Joctrines they hold in laith."
After Dr. Bliss' remarks the Rev. George
E. Swan made a brief address, in which he
declared h'm^elf much interested in Chris
tian socialism. A general discussion fol
lowed.
CHUEOH Or THE NAZARENE.
Dr. ltrepso Opened the New Movement
Ht Berkeley Last Night ; .:
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 7.â Dr. P. T.
Bresse of Los Angeles, the founder of the
Church of the Nazarene, arrived in Berke
ley this evening in time to open the fir-it
of the series of services preparatory to the
organization of a branch of the new or
ganization. The visitor is the guest of E.
A. Q rvin, who will take charge of the
Berkeley Nazarene Church, and who hald
an night prayer-meeting at his home
last night, preparatory 10 the forming of
the church here. -
The Church of the Nazarene is a re
turn to the old spirit described in the
words, 'Many were added daily,' " said
Dr. Br?sse to-night. "Since the organiza
tion of the church about fourteen months
ago it has constantly felt the spirit of re
vival and now has nearly 350 members.
We promulgate no new doctrine, but em
phasize the old, especially the teachings
of the possibility of entire sanctitication
by faith in this life after conversion. We
believe Cnrist said, 'Be ye "perfect, even as
your Father in heaven is perfect.' He
"meant to point out the r>ossibi:lty of per
fect cousecration to God in this life.
"One distinctive feature is devotion to
the poor, the church being in fact a sort
of ; combination: of Salvation Army ana
church. Our creed is a very .simple one,
as is also our church." There was only a
sm-ili gathering in Unity Hall to-night,
when the first meeting of the new move
ment was held. \ Dr. Bres-e was assisted
by E. A. Girvin in conducting thÂ«j exer
cises. The visitor preached a stirring ser
mon on the text, "The harvest is great,
but the laborers ara few." Meetings will
be held every.afternoon at 2:30 and every
evening during the next ten", days, after
which a church will be â â¢ organized, with
E. A. Girvin as pastor in charge.

NO CHANCE TO
STEAL HIS GOLD
Treasurer Wheeler Protects
His Office From
Burglars.
Thieves Would Fall Through
a Trap Into ths
City Jail.
Bank Commssioners Force an Offi
cial to Look After His
Own Treasury.
Oakland Office San Fraxcisco Call,)
808 Broadway, Jan. 7. f
City Treasurer Wheeler of Alameda is a
genius â a somewhat nervous one at pres
ent, it 'Â» true, but, still, possessing nerve
enough to protect the city's money.
Should a burglar break into his office
and stand before the safe he would in
stantly be transported tnrougk a neat
CITY TREASURER WHEELER of Alameda, Who Has Arranged
a Trap in His Office Which Will Land Burglars Through
the Floor and Into the Police Station.
trap in the floor rieht into the office of the
Chief of Police, which is immediately be
neath the iron box where is contained to
night $120,000 of the city's gold.
It all happened this way: The Bank
Commissioners were in Alameda yester
day, and they di'covered a vast amount
of the city's money in the bank vaults,
which i 3 a direct violation of the law cov
ering the matter. They immediately or
dered the bank to return it to the City
Treasurer, and since it was placed in his
vault he has not slept three consecutive
hours. Every night he has dreamed of
burglars breaking into his office and walk
ing off wi;h that gold.
The strain on his mind became so great
that he confided his fear to his assistant,
George Sturtevant. Now Sturtevant is of
a practical turn of mind. He looked
around the office and took in its situa
tion, both witn his eye and his mind; he
found that it was immediately over the
office of the Chief of Police, and he at
once conceived the idea that was put in
practice to-day. A trap with a very tender
spring was cut through the floor and
every night in the future wben the Treas
urer leaves his office the trap will be set. It
is placed immediately before the vaultand
is large enough to prevent any one getting
rear the oafe w : thout stepping on it. Any
thing even be it no heavier than a man's
hat, will open the trap and the intruder
would immediately drop to the presence
of the officers on duty at night.
The spring ia operated with aw electric
button which connects w-th the alarm
system and also the lighting apparatus,
so that any burglar who visits Mr. Whee
ler's office would light the room, ring an
alarm and at the same moment surrender
Himself to Officer Conrad.
"Look at tbe floor," said Mr. Wheeler
to-day; "you can't see anything there,
can you?" pointing to the front of the
Vault. "But there is something there,
and now I feel free from visits of burglars.
Should any one attempt to touch our *afes
ho would instantly regret it. At night
when I go home I leave this spring so set'
that any one who touches that section of
the floor drops instantly. This is the only
office in the country, so far as I know,
that is lucky enough to be directly over a
police office. In the daytime, shoulÂ«i any
one attempt to monkey with it while Mr.
S.urtevant or I are here, we can touch an
other button which will perform the same
object. ___________
AN INDIGNANT PASTOR.
Kcv. A. Bailey of Haywardg Had No
Trouble With Hi Choir.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 7.â A story was
published to-night in which several peo
ple residing at Haywards are named,
which is strenuously denied by the pastor
of the Congregational Church.
"The absurd story that the choir was
disbanded because of jealousy and flirt
ing is a cruel falsehood," said Rev. Mr.
Bailey to-nieht. "About six weeks aÂ«o
we had a difference of opinion regarding
congregational singing as compared with
choir singing, and it was thought better to
discontinue the choir, which consisted of
three Deopie.
"There is no foundation for saying that
Mr. Dean's conduct with one lady was the
cause of it. I do not believe that Mr.
Dean has done anything of which he need
be ashamed, and it is an outrage to use
ladies' names indiscriminately and with
out foundation."
Last Monday night J. E. Dean and his
wife had a dispute and Mrs. Dean made a
visit to her brother at Alameda. She re
joined her husband next day and they
nave lived in narmony since. The cause
of tbe dispute has not been made public,
and several respectable residents of Hay
wards xtated to-night that there was no
connection whatever between the Dean
quarrel and the church choir of which
â¢they both were members.
The discontinuance of the choir was a
circumstance that excited little comment
us it only consisted of three persons, Mr.
Dean, Miss Sturtevant and Mrs. Hatha
way. _
FOND OF YOUNG WIVES.
Cup'ain and Mrs. Ainswortb Return to
Oaklandâ The Captain's Marital
Ventures.
OAKLAND. Cal.. Jan. 7.â Captain G.
R. R. Ainsworth, the aged groom of 68,
who wedded a young lady last ni^ht in
San Francisco just half a century his
junior, was the recipient of many con
gratulations" on his return to tiia home
to-day.
The matrimonial adventures of Captain
Ainsworth are interesting. He is a pio
neer of Oakland and has been in the gro
cery busines-s for the past seventeen years.
He is now comparatively wealthy and has
two large store.". Ainsworth's first wife
died about seven leen year 3 ago, leaving
him two sons, "who are now married and
hive an interest in his business. About
two years after his first wife's death, when
Ainsworth was only 53, he took a second
wife, a girl of 20, who was considered one
of the prettiest maidens of West O iklami.
Their married lite was not happy and in
less than two years they were divorced.
The old captain then fought shy of matri
mony for a dozen years and a few months
ago met Miss Murphy, a young lady of 18,
whom he married last night.
Miss Dwyer's Death.
OAKLAND, CAL., JwiÂ» 7.â Miss Kate
Dwver, niJce of the late James Canning,
who donated $100,000 for the erection of
St. Francis de Sales Church, is dead.
Her demise will further complicate the
probate of the estate, which has been de
layed owing to the, fact that one of the
sons has not been heard of for nearly
seven years. The Dwyer family is one of
the first that settled between Temescal
and the university, and three daughters
still survive. â 
AT WORK ON HIS RECORD
Dr. Sharpe Attended a Young Girl
Who Tried to Commit
Suicide.
On That Occasion Only Great Pressure
Prevented a Warra r t B?ing Sworn
To by an Official.
Oakland Office Han Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 7. I
The investigations of the police make
the outlook for Dr. C. J. Sharpe, who is
confined in the tanks, very dark. The
doctor's plea that this is his drat difficulty
is not borne out by the facts. Ue was a
graduate of the same class as the notori
ous Dr. West, who figured in the Addie
Gilmour case.
Mrs. Lydia A. Prescott, secretary of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children, came very near swearing to a
complaint against the doctor a little time
ago on a charge similar to the one that
now hangs over him.
A young girl named Jennie Carson, 15
years of age, tried to commit suicide some
time ago, and in the investigation which
foi lowed Dr. Sharpe'a name was brought
into the case.
"Jennie Carson's mother reported the
case to me,", said Mrs. Prescott to-day,
"saying that her daughter had attempted
to commit suicide by taking carbolic acid
on account of the refusal of a young man
to marry her. He was a motorman on
the Alameda electric-car line, who had
ruined the girl under the pretext of mak
ing her tiis wife. After knowing the girl
for some time she insisted that Dolan
keep his promise. But he refused to do
so and instead called in the services of
Dr. Bharpe. The girl made this state
ment amler oalh. Dolan, the motorman,
took her to Dr. Sharpe's office, aud later
she became so ill that she was taken to
Reudy's Hotel, and Dr. Sharpe attended
Her. When her life was despaired of her
mother was notified and the girl confesssd
all. Fortunately for her, her fate was
better than that of Anna Johnson, but
afterward Dolan still refused to keep his
promise. The matter was laid before
District Attorney Snook, but there was no
prosecution."
Mrs. Prescott says she went to Dr.
Sharpe, and he stated that if the case
against Dolan were not pressed he would
do everything in his power Tor the girl.
Nothing was done for her, however, and
Dr. Sharpe was noi heard from till he fig
ured in sue case of Anna Johnson.

JUDGE CAMPBELL
RISES IN WRATH
Refuses to Preside in Court
Where O'Brien Is a
Clerk.
Will Bring His Troubles for In
vestigation by the Grand
Jury.
He Declares There Is No Truth in the
Vmdictiv.: Charge That Hi Sold
Orders cf Release.
The entente cordiale between Police
Judge Campbell and his clerk, T. B.
O'Brien, has been jarred again.
O'Brien has been making statements to
the effect that the Judge ha- been in the
habit of leaving blank orders of release
with his signature attached, where crimi
nals could easily find them.
The scandal was telegraphed broadcast,
and Judge Campbell learned of it in Sac
ramento. He immediately proceeded to
this City, and yesterday morning he held
court as was his wont.
Prior to attending to the regular busi
ness, however, Judge Campbell began
hauling his clerk over the coals. O'Brien
denied having seen any Examiner or
Chronicle reporter, and denied their pub
lished interviews.
Judge Campbell, after hearing the evi
dence of the affair, declared he would not
allow O'Brien to act another minute as
clerk of his court.
The bail bonds which Judge Campbell
was accused oÂ» having signed and left in the
possession of saloon-keepers and shyster
attorneys, are generally termed "0. R.s,' 1
meaning "own recognizance." In other
words, such a bond or release permits a
prisoner to leave the jail without furnis h
ing any security for his reappearance upon
the date set for his trial.
Judge Campbell denies that he ever did
anything of this kind, and adds that such
a proposition would be infamous.
"I propose to present the entire matter
io the Grand Jury," the Judge stated yes
terday to a ('all reporter. "If I have
done anything of that sort I should be in
dicted. If I have not done this, then
the newspapers â the Chronicle and Ex
aminer â that have published these scur
rilous articles should be indicted tor libel.
I propose to bring suit against them
anyhow.
When court convened Judge Campbell
said he had seen by the papers that he
was accused of having orders of discharge
signed in blank lying around in different
saloons that could oe had for a driuk, or
two dollars and a half. He said further
that t c clerk, T. B. O'Brien, .vas quoted
as making the charges. O'Brien denied,
however, that ho had said anything to
any reporter, or even that he had seen a
reporter.
The Judge then announced his inten
tion of having the matter thoroughly in
vestigated, and he ordered the bailiff to
find the reporters who had written the
articles.
In the afternoon John Kathom of the
Chronicle was called to tell of the article
he had written. He said he had inter
yiewe O'Brien at the New Western Hotel,
in O'Brien's bedroom, and that his report
where he had quoted O'Brien was practi
caily what O'Brien had said. Then the
proceedings continued:
The court (to Mr. O' Brien)â You have heard
the statement, Mr. O'Brien, by Mr. Rathoin.
Do you desire u> ask hiia any question?
Clerk O'Brienâ What do you obj ct to?
Tho courtâ l object to the statement you
made wherein you said there were blank or
ders of discharges signed by me in saloons
a 1 over San Francisco and could be had lor
$2 50.
Clerk O'Brienâ No, sir; I saidâ l never made
that statement. I said that was currently
rumored.
Thi- courtâ You said that?
Clerk O'Brienâ Yes, sir.
The couriâ Didn't you say this morning,
sir, you never had been interviewed by a re
poner?
Clerk O'Brienâ l was not on Monday night;
I was lan night, not on Monday night, though.
Tue courtâ Did you teh the reporter you had
been sitting nere lor two years and had twen â
I forget the languaseâ call this a den of
iniquity that I presided over us Judce?
Clerk O'Brien â I don't remember I used any
such language as that. That may be stated in
the newspaper, but I never used any such
language; there was no stenographic report
of it.
TboTcourt (to Mr. Rathom)â Did you get
this Irom Mr. O'Brien? A. That statement
there is praciicnlly what Mr. O'Brien said, sir.
The court (eaJmg)â "There are three or
four shady attorneys who have got their pock
ets full of these releases now." Did he say
that to you, sir? A. I am telling jou that
wlioie statement is practically what Mr.
O'Brien told me. I went up to him ; I had an
interview -with Mr. O'Brien and -isked him
these questions. He did not volunteer the
iniormation off hand; he did not stand up
and make a stump speech about it, but he said
those things in response to my queries on the
subject.
The court (interrupting)â Did he (refer
ring to Clerk O'Brien) cull this a den of in
iquity that I had been presiding over, or words
to that effect? A. They were the very words
tie said.
The courtâ l took the trouble to look into
this matter for the simple reason tuat I feel
and Know that a great injustice has been done
me. lem satisfied that every thinking and
reasonable man about the City does not give
any credence to that very foolish and puerile
statement, but it Bhows a vindictive spirit on
yonr part that la wholly unbecoming and un
"called for from sou toward me, au<l brings
this court into contempt and disrepute in the
eyes of the communi'y. or such of those as are
foolish enough to believe your )yine state
ment, and from the manner of your bold and
impudent denial of these charges ihis morning
and your now cringing action in the matter,
and upon the sworn statement of this news
paper reporter, f believe that what he pub
lished in the prtper you told him, and I do not
believe you are a fl 1 or proper person to be the
clerk in a court, and so far as I am personally
concerned you cannot be clerk of this court for
another minute. 1 would not preside over a
court with such a man as you as clerk in it, so
1 will adjourn this court until f can procure a
decent aud respectable clerk.

YANKEE DOODLE
IN TOWN AGAIN
Purser's Sprinter Takes j
the Fast Zamar II
Into Camp.
Flashlight Galloped in Before
the Favorite, Lady
Diamond.
â¢
First Choices in Front on Three
Occasions â Adolph Spreckels
Took the Distance Event
As Zamar II came on the track at Ingle
side yesterday, proudly galloping around
to the post with a jocsey clad in bright
red colors seated on his back, he was the
recipient of quite an ovation from the
occupants of the grand stand, When he
returned there was the hush of stillness in
the air. Dan Honig's good sprinter, with
ninety-seven oounds up, was a 7 to 5
favorite for the third event, a six-furlong
epin, but his enthusiastic admirers ;
counted their chickens before they were j
hatched. The improving form shown by
Yankee Doodle, which was in with 102
pounds, was overlooked, and the money
went in on him without cutting the
priceâ 2 to 1. Howard S, packing ninety
five pounds, received some support at odds
Slaughter on Zamar took no chances
this trip, but sent nis mount out in front
from the jump. Tod Sloan on Yankee
Doodle took matters quietly, uu heedful of
the intervening length of daylight separ
ating his mount from the leader, until
Jones on Howard S was at his side, and
then he made his move. Well into the
stretch he was at Zamar's head, and
Slaughter drew his whip. The Doodle
horse drew ahead and passed the wire a
clever winner by one length in 1:14%. 1"
a hard drive the favorite ias<ea long
enouga to take the place from Howard S
by a scant head. Arapahoe and Hazel D
were beaten off.
Tne otber events run off, although well
contested and good betting affairs, did not
excite as much interest from the crowd,
which was large. First choices lared very
well, leading their fields out on three dif
ferent occasions.
Only through the good riding of Willie |
Martin was Arrezzo, the 7 to 10 choice lor j
the first race, a seven-lurlona race for j
three-year-olds, enabled to land the purse, j
He took the lead from Jim Blackburn in j
the stretch, and, although wanting to I
stop badly at the end, Martin kept him
up and won from George Palmer, tne sec
ond choice, by a head. Phiiip H, a 100 to
1 beat Jim Blackburn, who was the
only other starter, half a length for the I
show.
There was no pronounced favorite
among the nine starters that lined up in
the seven furlong condition race that fol- |
lowed, Joan, Miss Cunningham, Jack j
Richelieu and Boreas all being held at ;
about the same odds. It proved quite a j
snap for Joan. Cochran's erratic mare j
led throughout, disposing of Jack Rictie- :
lieu very handily at the wire by a couple j
of lengths. Boreas was nosed out for
plane.
Fourth on the card wa3 another seven i
furlong trip, which marked the downfall |
of the 7to o favorite Lady Diamond. The ;
Baldwin mare, opening in the ring at
twos, was speedily backed down. Flash- j
light, which also opened at 2 to 1, was |
played down to 8 to 5, later receding to 11
to 5. The race was a gift for the latter
horse. He took the lead from Minnie Ccc
at the far turn, and won in romping iash
ion from the favorite, which had to be
hard ridden to down Lovdal for the place.
Pat Dunne's Salvable fell from the sixth
story again and uligiited on a feather bed.
Starting an odds-on choice for the mile
dash with bu: five starters, he galloped in
front of Kamsin the entire route, win
ning without effort in 1:42%.
The mile and a quarter run which con
cluded the programme resulted in the j
crushing defeat of the 7 to 5 lavonte Salis- I
bury 11. Both the lauer horse and Peter
the Second opened up at 8 to 5, stable
money making the Burns Â«fc Waterhouse
entry favorite. Salisbury made the rac
ing under wraps for six furlongs and then
"olew.up," fin.s ing last. In a drive Willie
Martin got Adolph Spreckels, the third
choice, past the judges, half a length in

Edward Corrigan will probably leave
for Chicago on a business trip during the
early part of the coming week.
Trie stable wanted to put Do'an up on
Joan, but looking into the camera lucida
Captain Kees saw A. Thompson idly sit
ting on the paddock fence and recom
mended Gene Irtish's boy. After all
there must be something in "hunches."
; It will be with regret that the many
friends of the popular trainer, Frank
Taylor, will learn of his serious illness.
Yesterday his condition was so precarious
that a message was sent to the track sum
moning his brother-in-law, Sam Hildreth.
and fears were entertained for his re
covery. . ; .
When Tod Sloan was here before be
was a good jockey; to-day he is a better
one. .He rides with Â» confidence border
ing on the immadulate, and his piloting
of Yankee Doodie would be hard to im
prove upon.
Salisbury II was on the sick list not
long ago, and iiis run yesterday shows
that he is hardly just right yet. How
ever, the stable thought well enough of
him to invest $1000 on the son of .Racine
chances. â "â  .
Mr. Corrigan was fortunate in having
some oiie tell him that Peter the Second
was a "good thing," and with a ticket on
that horse he saw his own, Adolph
Spreckels, win by half a length.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 1897.
STATE LICENSE
NOT IN FAVOR
Liquor Men Are Opposed
to Governor Budd's
Recommendation.
It Is Claimed That the State
Has No Power to Pass Any
Revenue Law.
G neral Opinion Amen* the Whole
salers That the Trade Is Tpx.'d
All It Cm Stand.
Governor Budd's recommendation for
the imposition of a license tax of $100 a
year on every saloon in the State does not
meet with the approval of the wholesale
dealers in wines, beers and liquors.
J. P. Edoff, president of the California
Protective Association and a member of
the firm of Dallemand & Co., speaking of
the portion of the Governor's message
which relates to this subject, said:
"This is the first time that an executive
of this State has in his message recognized
the lact that there was a traffic of this
kind. (
"Two years ago the California Protec
tive Association tried to have the State
Legislature recognize the traffic by adopt
ing the so-called maximum license bill.
The Senate Judiciary Committee, how
ever, refused to recommend the passage of
the measure on the ground that it would
be a recognition of the traffic. But it
seems tue Governor has giver, the sutject
m'atter more th ought than the Judiciary
Committee did. He thinks that the traffic
ougut to be recognized by the establish
ment of an excise commission, somewhat
on tne lines of the Raines act of New
York, but in a modified form.
"I think that tnere is a diversity of
opinion among the wholesale dealers of
the State in regard to the expediency of
attempting anything of this kiud. I be
lieve that the majority of the wholesale
trade thinks the trade is already taxed
heavily enough by the local authorities,
and that any additional tax will be a
burden that the trade cannot stand.
"On the other Hand some houses believe
the true remedy for existing evils, it there
are any evils, lies in a hijjh Lcense. li tlie
Governor's recommendation is carried out
ry the adoption of ihe proposed bill of the
Code Commission, which provides for an
annual license of ?&->O, it would mean that
the liquor-dealers of San Francisco would
have to pay $354 per year, those of Oak
land $700, Alam-?dfts3oo, Los Angeles sloso
and ban Die^.o $1300.
"Ttie Governor lays great stress by
means of tabulation on the fact that one
third of the liquor-deaiers of the Slate
escape paying a license, but overlooks the
fact that he has not any of the compila
tions of cities like Oakland and other in
corporated towns in counties where the
County Boards of Superv.sors do not exact
a license and where the municipality does.
If he had taken the trouble to get from
such uunicipahties a list of the licenses
paid them 1 feel satisfied that he would
rind that His figures of one-third woula be
incosrect.
"Again, many drugstores and restau
rants, as well "as hotels, especially in
Southern California, do not pay a city or
county license, but are compelled by the
laws of the United States to take out an
internal-revenue license.
"It is also true that in the City of San
Francesco there are at least 1500 restau
rants which sell beer and wine, but do i:ot
sell whisky, and which are compelled by
the United States laws to take out an in
ternal-revenue license.
"Therefore I am inclined to thinK that
if the Governor had taken up the subject
thoroughly be would have ascertained
that, one-tnird ot the dealers in liquors
who pay a license to the United States do
not need to pay any to any of the various
counties and cities.
"I do not believe that any law passed by
the Legislature of the State, in accordance
with the constitution, would have the
effect oi accomplishing the result that the
Governor makes mention of; that is to
say, an increase of the revenues of the
State at the expense of the liquor traffic.
"Ever since the adoption of the present
constitution the riaht of local self-govern
ment in reeard to sanitary and polico mat
ters, as well asthe rightof issuing licenses,
has been recognized as resting in the va
rious counties and municipalities, as can
be seen by reference to section li of arti
cle XI of the constitution.
F. Frederick Plagemann of Siebe Bros.
& Plageiiiann said: <The proposition is
an outrage. The liquor-dealers are taxed
out of their boots now. In some counties
of this State the license is already almost
prohibitive. There are already three li
cense taxes imposed on the I quor-dealers,
the Federal, the county and ihe munici
pal. Now Budd proposes to add a fourth.
He is ihe last man that ought to advocate
any such thing and tuis is the la*,t State
in the Union where the law-makers ought
to set their faces against the liquor trade.
Grape-growing and wine and b.umiy man
u'acture form the most important indus
tries in the State, and they should be en
couraged instead of being taxed out ol ex
istence. No fair-minded man would think
of advocating the placing of any addi
tional burdens on the men engaged in
these lines. All these movements are
simply on'tne lines of temperance move
ments and are opposed to the best inter- |
ests of the State. However, there is no
use talking about it, for no such bill will
pass. It is already a dead letter. 1 have
talked with n number of liauor men about
it and they simply say it will never be
come a law."
Joseph I. Dimond said: "This is sim
ply a cinch bill, or will be used for cinch
bill purposes. The legislators will em
ploy this recommendation of Budd's as a
excuse for p^esentinc a bill to load more
taxes on the liquor men. There will
probabiy be a show of interest in the
thing, and it will be referred :o a commit
tee, and tiien it will devolve upon the
whisky men to buy the committee. That
it a hat it will be for, and that is what the
liquor men will be expected to do."
'I wouldn't give 'em so much as a chew
of tobacco," said a friend of Dimond's, en
gaged in the same trade, standing by.
"That is all very well," said Dmond;
"you are a distiller's agent and so prob
ably would have to. But the wholesalers
will have to put vp â that's all there is
about it. I 'ion't know whether Budd is
in 011 this thing or not, but I know that
all that will come of his recommendation
is just what I say."
John Spruance of Spruance & Stanley
said: "I haven't looked into the matter
and don't know just what is intended in
the recommendation of the Governor, but
if it is the puTpos-e to make a general
State license and take the power of fixing
licenses oat of the hands ol t c BoarJs of
Supervisors and Town Councils I am iv
favor of it. It would be a gooa thing.
The rate of license is very uneven through
out the State. In some place* the license
is yery low and in some it is very high.
It could be made uniform and I think
should be. However, nil the license, high
and low, does not amount to a million
dollars. I think that amount to b - raised
from the liquor trade tÂ« excessive."
Cremation is more extensively practic d
in Italy than in any country. The first
crematorium was established in Milan in
1876, and there are now fifty in operation
in Italian territory.

GENERAL ESTRADA PALMA
REFUSES VOLUNTEER AID
Federal Statutes Clearly Blockade Cuban Sympathizsrs
From Raising Funds for the
Insurgents.
ALLIES MUST BE WARY
District Attorney Foote Says the
Provisions Are Very
Severe.
Friends of the Insurgents Will Be Com
pelled to Abandon Their
Relief Measures.
The volunteer movement of divers
American citizens to aid the Cuban insur
gents in their efforts to gain freedom
seems likely to be nipped in the bud. No
rody has made any active effort to stop
the friends ot Cuba from organizing a
movement to aid the rebels, but General
Estrada Palma has refused to accept aid
or give any encouragement to volunteers,
because he is afraid of the extradition
laws.
Messrs. Jones and Mascherini, leadersof
the local movement to raise fund* for the
aid of th* insursents, wrote to General
Estrada Palma nearly three weeks ago
outlining what they proposed to do. Tney
waited twelve days, then wired, but got
no response: then wired again, and now
thfV have written, sending a registered
letter to make sure that it will oe received.
The Call correspondent in New York
called on General Paima yesterday and
lounu that the leader of the Junta had
delayed replying because overcrowded

open defiance of the neutrality laws, a nd
INDIAN ART WORK
LINED THE WALLS
Unique Reception Given by
Wcmen of Century-
Club.
A Bower of Picturesque Signs
ot a Poetic Aboriginal
Life.
Treasures Loaned by Many Citzns
Attract Hundreds cf
Guests.
The Century Club, composed of many of
the most prominent luerary, artistic and
social women of San Francisco, held a
large reception yesterday afternoon in its
commodious clubhouse.
The rooms v.ore filled with Indian art
work and curios untii every bit of wall
space, even to the windows, was covered
with things that went to nmke up one of
the most complete displays of the kind
ever seen in this City. Lights and ever
greens and floral decorations completed
the effect of a dusky bower made agree
able by the more poetic suggestions of In
dian life.
Yesterday's public reception was what
might have been termed % large and de- I
lightful aftermath of the Century Club's i
entertainment for its members the day j
before. It is a custom with the club to j
devote the first Wednesday of the month j
to art and literature, tho second to fcienre ;
and education and the third to practical
questions. In arranging for the first reg- '
uiar entertainment oi the new year t!ie I
committee on art and literature, composed i
of Mrs. Horace Wilson (chairman). Miss
Kva Withrow, Mrs. Lovell White, Mrs. W.
H. Mills and Mrs. Geoige E. Sage, had, I
upon Mrs. White's suggestion, decided so
make it strictly an indian affair, and
everything was done to carry out the
unique idea.
Among the interesting exhibits were
souvenirs of Helen Hunt Jackson, who
in her *tory of Katnona introduced a
charming romance into the lives ol some
prosaic mission Indians of Sout' crn Cali- \
fomia. The very table on which the j
manuscript of Ramuna was written
formed an important part of this particu- j
lar feature of the display.
Many things were borrowed for the dis
play. Paintings were loaned by James D.
i J helan ; Mrs. Louis Sioss had rontribtre-J I
her valuable Alaska collec.ion; Mrs. j
Charles Wheeler had furn"isheil a number |
of MCiures of Indian cnaracters painted ;
by Mrs. Hudson; Mrs. C. B. Bishop had j
added a large collection of Indian-wrought \
baskets; Mrs. Irusdale had loaned the]
Ramona collection. Others, also, lent i
things.
The whole collection was valued at $20,- j
000 and two police oflice;s were constantly I
in attendance to insure its safety.

evidences of aboriginal art and character

must consequently make them the same
reply as has been made to others: "Thank
you for your kind offer. If we could ac
cept your offer without violation of the
law we would."
The conclusion of the general to refuse
the proffered assistance or to treat it with
silenco practically ends the incident so
far as meetings to raise fund? are con
cerned, because the leaders of the move
ment here and at Los Angeles have openly
siated that without credentials fiom the
Junta they would do nothing by way of
agitation. In spite of the great meetings
in Los Angeles and the preparations to in
terest people here the new development
will end all efforts in behalf ot the
insui tent--.
It is not improbable that some oKthe
friend* of Spain will take Jegal steps
against the lriends of Cuba if they at
tempt to raise any funds for the insur
gent-.
The United States neutrality laws,
which General Estrada Palma fears, are
very far-reaching. From section 5281 of
the Rpvi-ed Statutes of the United Slates
to 52iÂ»0 inclusive tne subject is treated in
detail. In a general way it is provided
that every citizen accepting a commission
or hiring another as a soldier, marine or
seaman, or who tits out, arms or nids an
expedition against a friendly power in any
way, may be lined $2000 or imprisoned for
two years.
Section 5281 makes it an offense to ac
cept a foreign commission, while the next
section coveis "enlij'tkig in the service."
Sections 5283 and 5286 make it a grave of
fense to aid a military or naval expedition
against any people at peace with the
United States.
"The provision* ol the law on this sub
ject are very comprehensive," said United
States District Attorney Foote yesterday,
â 'and while I know nothiitg about any
plan to aid the insurgents it would
surely come before the United States
courts were overt acts committed within
our territory in defiance of the provisions
of the United States statutes."
It is therefore apparent that the hun-
the club held its entertainment. The
proer.imme consisted in the reading of a
number of papers prepare! especially for
the occasion. Mrs. Grace Hudson dis
cussed tliÂ«Â» old Porao tribe. Mrs. Lemmoii
described some of the arts and primitive
industries of California. Miss Ina Cool
j brith dealt with the Indian of romance,
and in conclusion the Indian of reality
was introduced. He was represented in
the life by descendants of the erstwhile
noble red man. Two real live Indians in
paint and costume did a war dance, and
an Indian woman sang a weird song
peculiar to the musical conception of her
race. After the regular programme a
reception was held in honor of Mrs. Grace
Hudson, the artist who makes a specialty
of Indian character.
But yesterday there was no prosramme.
It was simply a large reception to the
I friends of the m?mbers of the Century
! Club and they came and enjoyed it.
General invitations had been sent to all
I the women's clubs in and about San Fran
j Ciscoâ the Sorosis, the Fortnightly, the
I Laurel Hall, the Philomath, the Forum,
i the Women's Press Association, the Mer
! cantile Library Auxiliary, the Ebell and
others.
Among the several hundred person*

JOSHUA HENDY'S WILL.
1 he Testator Wrote It Himself and the
Lawyers Get Good â â¢ Fees From
the ate.
Judge Coffey heard testimony yesterday
in rceard to attorneys' fees in the settle
ment of the Joshua Hendy estate.
Considerable litigation grew out of the
uncertainty of the meaning of Mr.
Hendy's will, which was written by hiru
self,was holographicin form and contained
a number of errors in spelling.
Tne first application for fees was pre
sented on behalf of J. B. Langhorne and
John H. Mhoon, attorneys for Josephine
Green. Mrs. Green said she thought sl2oo
encli would be sufficient for her a'.torneys.
Judge Coffey iemarked that be knew oj
no law that would authorize him to pay
the lawyers who represented ths opj>o
nen:sof the estate, and the lawyers were
given furiher time in which to present
authorities.
Attorneys E. B. Young and W. H. H.
Hart were allowed $1500 each as attorneys
lor t lie estate. The amounts allowed to
iawyers engaged in the Hendy estate up
to tne present time is as follows: W. H.
H. Hart, $6500; W. H. L. Barrios. $5000;
A. R. Cotton. $2500; Nowlin & Fassett,
$JSOU; E. B. Young, $1500; oiher fees in
minor matters, $1500. Total, $19,500.
The estate has paid $29,000 to compro
mise the ciuim of Samuel Hendy, $.0,000
to Josephine Gre.en, and is still wortu
about half a million dollars, with the
value constantly increasing.
Judge Coffey complimented Superin
tendent Hendy for his management of the
affairs of the estate and particularly of
the machine works, saying that Mr.
Hendy ought to hav<Â» at least $1000 a
month instead of $450, his present
monthly sa.nr/.
CRUSHED BY A WAGON.
Probable Fatal Accident to James
Wood beck, a Boy.
James Wood beck, a bo3 r 7 years of age,
living with his parents at 214 Capp street,
met with an accident that may result
fatally, yesterday afternoon.
He and another boy were riding in a
huid wagon on the sidewalk on Folsom
street, between Fifteenth and Sixteenth,
when the wagon went too near the cirb
stone and was tonpled over. Young
Wood beck fell on the street, and
st that moment a wagon belong
ing to the Eclipse Crocker Kakery,
1414 Dupont street, was beinsr driven past
a:iu before the driver, Char.es Coiombet,
couid pull up his team the wheels passed
over the boy's body, crushing it badly.
Coiombet lifted up the boy and drove
him home. A pnysucian was summoned,
but he did not express a decided opinion
whether the injuries would prove fatal.
Coiombet went to the Seventeenth-street
station and offered to surrender himself.
Lieutenant Burke went to the boy's
father,' who refused to prefer a charge
against ("olombet, as he believed it was
purely an accident.

died or more persons eager to fight lor
Cubans or to give them money will be com
pelled to abandon their plans, for they
have run squarely against the laws of the
United States.
General Palma will accept no aid, and
without credentials from him the local
leaders will not try to make any collec

VIOLATING NEUTRALITY.
Attorney Charles Paare Says the
Offenders Must Be Caught In the
Act, as in Smuggling.
Interest has been aroused during the
last few months, anent the Cuban war, on
the question as to how far the people of
the United States or other neutral coun
tries could go in furnishing aid to the
insurgents.
From the fact that the Cuban authori
ties semi-occasionally seize vessels en-
gaged in conveying arms and supplies, it
has been thought that the owners of the
vessels had been violating the neutrality
laws, but this is not necessarily the case.
Charles Page, who is one of the leading
authorities on international Jaw, says that
merchant vessels have a perfect riÂ«jht to
carry arms, money and provisions, and if
they are landed successfully Cuba can
have no recourse against the United
States. She may have found out after
ward that the arms and supplies were
actually furnished, and be able to prove
this, but that will cut no figure. She can
get no indemnity. Sue must, if she
would even up for what would bu consid
ered the offense, eaten those who furnish
the goods and arms in the very act.
But citizens of the United States must
not organize an expedition with the open
aivi avowed intention of furnishing such
aid to insurgents. That would bd a vio
lation of the neutrality law. The question
turns really, therefore, on the fitting out
of the expedition.
It is a matter, as Mr. Pace points out,
much like smuggling. The United States
has no power to prevent any of its citizens
from smuggling* into any other country.
It has nothing to do witu it, and only
takes cognizance of violations in our own
country.
But if those citizens of the United States
get caught by the officials of the country
where they have been smuggling they are
amenable to the laws of that country, and
may be punished by the methods laid
down in the laws of that country. The
United States cannot say it nay. It has
nothing to do with it.
It would appear that the old aphorism,
"Do not get caught," haÂ« a great deal to
do with it, barring, of course, the recog
nized rights of merchantmen. The rais
ing of men in the United States and the
method of thtfir being forwarded, as well
as the landing of arms, is all right if it is
done right.
BICYCLES AS
FREE LUGGAGE
Proposed Amendment of
the Wheelmen to the
Civil Code.
Will Shortly Be Presented to
the Legis'ature for Con
sideration
The New Act Will Affect Cyclers,
Hunters, Anglers, Artists and Out.
dco'r Pfco!ograpners.
Since the convening of the State Legis
lature at Sacramento one of the first acts
of the organized wheelmen has been the
preparation of their so-called baggage
bill, under which bicycles shall be carried
free by transportatibn companies as lug
gage.
Frank H. Kerrigan, chief consul of the
League of American Wheelmen; Charles
Albert Adams, *'rank H. Dunne and
Percy V. Long, all prominent attorneys oi
this City, met recently and formulated
the following amendment to the Civil
Code, which it is thought will cover the
cround desired:
Section 2181 of the Civil Code of California
is hereby amended so as to read as follows:
Section 1. Luggage may consist oi what
ever the passeugu r takes with him for his per
sonal use and convemcuce, according to the
habits or wants of the particular class to
which he belongs, either with reierence to the
immediate necessities or to the ultimate pur
pose of the journey. No crate, cover or other
protection stia'.l be required for any bicycle
carried as luggage, but no passenger shall be
entitled to curry as luggage more than one
bicycle.
Sec. 'J.. This act shall take effect and be in
force from and after its passage.
Mr. Adams was seen by The Call rep
resentative yesterday and expressed the
belief that the measure would pass both
houses. "It is aimed to be of benefit to
other classes besides the cyclers, you will
notice," he said. "Hunters can transport
their guns and dogs without charge, nsh
ermen their tackle, artists their brusi.es,
paints and easels, photographers their
tripods and cameras and so on ad infini
tum, so that we may reasonably expect
support from all these sources. Besides
the measure is manifestly fair, and is not
a hardship to the transportation com
panies. It would discourage t lie cyclers
and men in other branches of sport If
they i. ad to pay for their wheels, guns,
etc., when taking an outing in the coun
try, and they would be likely to go in di
rections where they would not need to
take a train. Thus the railroads would
lose their passenger fare and be out that
much."
It is the intention to send a committee
to Sacramento shortly to present this bill
to the legislators. It will be fathered by
the League of American Wheelmen, and
such ot the funds as can be spared from
the earnings of Hie proposed benefit meet
of the league at the Velodrome on Satur
day, January 1(5, will be devoted toward
defraying the expenses, of that com
mittee. The wheelmen are very much
interested in the measure, and aie
earnestly hoping for ils adoption.
SUICIDE IN THE BRUSH.
The Head Body of a Man Found on the
Spring Valley Grounds.
The dead body of a man in an advanced
state of decomposition was found yester
day in the brush on the Spring Valley
grounds, about a mile below Ocean View,
by some boys.
A pistol was grasped firmly in the man's
right hand, which led to the supposition
that he had committed suicide. The ap
pearance and clothing of the man indi
cated that lie bad been a laborer.
The Coroner of San Mateo County was
notified and the body was removt-d to the
nearest roadhouse, where an inquest will
be held.

ing its own ground and building first en
tered the mind of Past Master Gustave
Gunzendorfer during bis first incumbency
in 1894. Having made known these desires
to some of the members the question be
came agitated until eventually in 1895 and
during his second term as worshipful
master the following committee on "lot
and building" was appointed : G. Gunzen
dorfer (chairman), A. If. Blade, A. H.
Kayton, W. C. Wi*e, F. H. Wood, William
Filmer and L. Shilling.
This committee pushed the scheme to a
finality by purchasing the lot. The history
A. M. Blade, Who Will Assist in
Building the New Masonic Hall*
of Kinp Solomon's Masonic Lodge dates
bnck only seventeen years on the 10th of
February, 1880.
Ihe lollowing Waster Masons applied
for a dispensation to tbe grand master,
which was issued, and subsequently ob
tained a charter: A. F. Knorp, A. H.
Wands, C. E. Blake, Thomas McWattie,
O. H. Smyth, R. H. Thorpe, J. H. Smith,
J. F. Stuyvesant, Gam Swift, J. T. Minor,
G. W. Darbey, M. H. Smith, F. Schaffner,
J. M. Fleming, Thomas Patton, \V. Fil
mer, W. Banks. A. L. Meyer, J. W. Kins
ley. J. C. Hoag, C. S. Bonney and James
Warwick.
From this small beginning King Solo
mon's Lodge crew and prospered, havinj*
now a membership over 300, with a bank
account sufficient to undertake the
erection of a $25,000 building.
The present officers who were installed
during the past month, are:
A. M. Blade, worshipful mnster; A. H. Kay
ton, senior warden; F. B. Wood, junior war
den ; B. F. Jellisoii, treasurer; Hurry Baahv,
secretary; C. L. P. Marais, senior dencon ; G.
P. Godsey, junior deacon; Charles Moores,
marshal: George Wit tman, senior stewura : A.
H. Lav, iunior steward; George C. Dawson,
tyler, and A. A. Batlciu, organist.
Tiiese, with the committee already
mentioned on lot and buildinir, will push
the completion of the new hall to a 6nisn
before the termination of their official
career, and by Â«<o doinc add another at
traction to the W stern Addition.
Pentecostal Convent ion.
The Rev. A. Coplin of Oakland will
open a two weeks' pentecostal convention
at tbe Christian Assembly Hall, 1237 Mar
ket street, with meetings daily at 2 and
7:80 p. m. The reverend gentlemen is a
former Methodist minister, and is highly
recommended by Dr. P). R. tfille, Dr.
Alfred Kurnmer, .Rev. C. H. Hobart, and
other Chi is turn workers. He has held
two successful conventions in Santa Rosa
and one in Oakland.
BOXERS NOT AMATEURS.
Participants in Recent Olympic Tour
naments to Be Ex
pelled.
To-night an effort will be made by some
of the members of the Pacific Association
of the Amateur Athletic Union to have
all the contestants in the latest Olympic
Club boxing tournament declared profes
sionals.
The boxers affected by this contemplated
action arÂ« Hayes of the Olympic Club and
Egan ot the Manhattan Club, F. Schulerof
the San Francisco Athletic Clut> and James
Lawlor of the Acme Clud, James Brown of
the Olympic Club and J. Mulligan of the
Manhattan Club, J. W. Reay of the Olym
pic Club and P. Lynch of the San Fran
cisco Athletic club.
Some action may also be taken in the
case of Tighe of the Acme Club, who is
known to have signed a contract to fight
Muller, a professional, for $75, though the
evidence ol the contract disappeared sub
sequently to the contest. One of the
officials of the Amateur Union asserts that
he saw the contract.
The board of managers of the Pacific
Association will also deal with the Butte
football team. The Montana players wili
probably be officially declared profes
sionals pending a final decision by the
head councils of the union.
In order to do the fair thing in consid
eration of their questioned standing the
Butte team canceled its final game that
was to have been played in Portland last
Tuesday with the soldiers of Vancouver
Barracks. Its mana er. George McMillan,
sent word to the officials of the Amateurs'
Union that the Butte team had declared
t tie game oft and cone home.
Tne proposition of sending the winning
university track athletic team East at the
expense of the association will probably
also come op.

IVoolsey Nearly Loses Her
Life.
Through, the. carelessness of a nune j
