OF BALTINO
Greek Irregulars Are Fighting
Fiercely on the Frontier
of Macedonia.
TURKS BEING BADLY BEATEN.
Now the Ottoman Government Intends to
Seize and Hold Larissa Until the
Greek Troops Withdraw
From Crete*
LONDON, Eng., April I- 1 . â A dispatch
to the Daily Telegraph from Trikkala con
firms the reported capture of Baltino, and
adds that the insurgents also hold the vil
lage of Kyprio. Baltino is among tbe
mountains oi Western Macedonia, a little
north of the border, and sixty miles north
west of Larissa, headquarters of the Greek
Crown Prince. A telegram also received
at Athens from Larissa shortly before
midnight says the Greeks had won entire
possession of Baltino.
The Chronicle has received a dispatch
from Kalambaka which says the Turkish
garrison at Baltino, after a heroic resist
ance, escaped Sunday night. The fieht
ing was continued for a few miles west of
Baltino. The irregulars are benumbed by
the cold weather and nearly starving.
Many of them are returning to the fron
tier lor bread. It is added that the whole
movement is deplored. Tbe Greek offi
cers did everything possible to prevent
the departure of the raiders. After cap
turing Baltino the insurgents besieged
the village of Valestino, where, according
to a Turkish telegram, they were repulsed.
The main body of the insurgents is- said
to be advancing on Grevena, where it is
expected a decisive battle will be fought.
The insurgents are reported to be only
three hours' march from the town.
The Times correspondent telegraphs
that if the Ethnike Hetairia had not un
dertaken to cut the gordion knot the Gov
ernment would hays been obliged to take
a decisive step in a very few day?.
Delyanni*, Prime Minister, in an inter
view to-aay said that in the present state
of her finances Greece could naintain
80 000 men under arms any length of time
without enormous sacrifices. If Greece
fights at all it must be immediately. The
Government was forewarned by the Arme
nian massacres and had been hoarding
? old two years. Hitherto Greece has not
had to have recourse to the market, but

A reporter of the Daily News who is
with the Greek insurgents has sent a long
story of tbe advance into Macedonia, tbe
chief interest in which centers in tbe at
tack upon Baltino. He says while the in
surgents were advancing upon that place j
they were constantly harassed by a mus
ketry fire from the Turkish stations, to j
which the Greek troops occupying corre- j
sponding outposts replied vigorously, i
The insurgent chieftain, Baveiis, stormed |
several Turkish stations, the garrisons of
which were forced to flee to Baltiuo with
a heavy loss. Upon reaching tne outer
! most houses of the town the insurgents
i poured a sharp tire into the Turkish force,
j which occupied a large two-story house in j
| the center of the place. The Turks held ;
, the ground, and it bad become evident i
' that it would take a great deal of fighting
> to dislodge them.
Captain MyJonas of the insurgent force
sent two Turks who had been captured to
inform the Turkish commander it would
be useless, to resist. The Turkish officer
replied be would right to the last. Cap-
â  t tain Mylonas thereupon gave an order to !
1 cease tiring, intending to use dynamite to j
blow up the Turkish position. After j
j night had fallen tbe Turks made three {
1 sorties, but each time were driven back
! with heavy loss. Tbe plan to destroy the
building with dynamite did not prove
successful, as tbe explosives could not be
'effectively placed. Captain Mylonas'
i feared a bayonet charge would invdlvetoo ;
great a loss of life, and decided to attempt
to starve the garrison out. The writer
departed from Baltino with a convoy of
prisoners early in the morning to send a
dispatch to his paper. He was overtaken I
at noon by a runner, who announced
that a battalion of Turkish troops with a
mountain gun bad attempted to relieve

Baltino. They wera defeated and nearly
annihilated by the insurgents, who com
pletely surrounded them. The loss to the
insurgent* at the time tne writer left
them was nine killed.
The Italians who volunteered for ser
vice with the Greeks were worn oat by
tbe rough marching across the frontier
and left behind. They arrived, however,
in time to take part in the lighting.
Later, half of them decamped, not being
able to withstand the snow and cold
weather. Reports reach here to-nUht
that the Greek insurgents have reached
the city of Grevena, but cannot be con
firmed.
A dispatch to the Daily Mail from
Larissa says it ia reported that owing to
the capture of Baltino hv the insurgents,
tbe Turkish troops occupying the block
houses on the frontier are panic-stricken
and deserted tbe posts last night. The
Greek troops in the blockhouse opposite
Lavira crossed the frontier and occupied
the abandoned Turkish positions, where
they still remain.
A dispatch to the Evening News from
Larissa sayt it is reported that the Turks
who were encasing the Greek invaders in
the forest near Greyena save up the con
test Saturday. The fighting was done at
long range and the casualties were less
than 100 on both sides, the Greeks losing
fewer than the Turks, owing to the pro
tection of large trees. The insurgents
were cut off from the commissary, but
succeeded in holdinsr their own through
out a long period of desultory fighting.
The invaders are not supported by the
Grces regulars, who did not crons the

An Alarming State of Affairs
as Reported by an Army
Officer.
Fresh Breaks in the Levees Occur
and Hundreds of Square Miles â¢
Are o*44* WÂ«ter
BT. LOU 18. Mo., April 12.â A bad break
in the levee at Tallulah, La., was reported
late to-night. Davis Inland, with 2500 in- |
habitants, is being flooded.
Under the new system of guarding the i
levees camps are established at intervals,
of 1000 jards. From the center men patrol j
the levee in each direction. A few of the \
low places in the Tensas line of leveea
are being raised. Biggs levee gave entirely
away two days ago, and would have let
the waters loose over the northern part of
the Sate but for the gallantry of 300 con
victs stationed there. The men threw
themselves into the breech, and, after a
struggle lasting over twenty -four hoars,
succeeded in checking the water.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 12.â A
comprehensive account of the situation in
a part of the flooded district was received
at the War Department today from one
of the officers assigned for duty along the
Mississippi. Secretary Alger considers it
the most important report received. The
officer telegraphed that he had made a
personal inspection of the Memphis-Cairo
district, north of Ashport, Term., which
includes ninety miles of the river. He
found eighteen crevasses in the levees.
Forty-rive square miles in the Tennessee
territory in the Memphis district are under
water. About 1500 refugees have been
brought to Memphis, nearly all suffering
from want. The officer thinks the num
ber represents barely a quarter of those
needing immediate assistance. The con
dition in Mississippi County, Term., is
representative of general conditions. Nine
tenths of its 808 square miles are covered
with water from three to seven feet deep.
Ont of a population of 15,000 about 6COO
are in want. Affairs in Crittenden County
are even worse. The suffering is rapidly
increasing. __________^_
WILL BREAK THE DEADLOCK.
Gold Democrats m the Kentucky Legisla

FRANKFORT, Kt.. April 12.â There
was no quorum in the joint legislative
session to-day, the gold Democrats join
ing the silventes to prevent a vote, but
this afternoon they announced they would
not do so any longer. They say Henry
L. Martin, a gold Democrat and Black
burn supporter, can be elected Senator if
the silverites co-operate. Otherwise they
will help elect either Boyle or Yerkes,
Republicans. They refuse to help elect
Hunter, the regular candidate. It is be
lieved the deadlock will be broken to-mor
row. If tlie Grand Jury returns a true
bill against Hunter on the charges that
he offered to buy three Democratic votes
he will lose all chances. Hunter went be
fore the jury to-day and swore the charges
were untrue.
KNEIPP-CURE SANITARIUMS.
Company Formed for Their Es'ablish
ment and fo Promulgate the Doc
trine in Every State.
NEW YORK, N\ V., April 12.â A con
cern formed to promulgate the Kneipp
caro doctrine is arranging to establish
sanitariums in every State. Henry
Charles, president of the American Kneipp
Cure Company, intends to give a regular
course of study so that patients may com
pletely understand tae theory while un
dergoing treatment. The company ex
pects boon to erect a $100,000 sanitarium
near Babylon, Long Island, one at Ashe
ville, N. C, and another at Bopton.
Charles says there are now 500 institu
tions in Germany, 300 in France and 200
in England. "The failure of the move
ment in this country last year," ho says,
"shows the inability of amateurs to han
dle such affairs. We will give the pure
water cure of Rev. Sebastian Kneipp, se
cret chamberlain of the Pope. People
gained the impression that paddling
about in the wet grass was about all the
cure amounted to. In addition to the
water cure there is herbal treatment, the
Kneipp diet and health underwear. There
are now about twenty Kneipp institutions
In this country."

CHICAGO, In., April 12.â President
S paid ing of the collapswi Globe Bank
slipped into town at midnight and
aroused Justice Hall. Technically he
surrendered himself, and being provided
with bondsmen, gave ball and was re
leased. This alterooon he said :
"I hsve never been out of the city to
dodge the detectives. Every depositor
will get the full amount. Stockholders
will realize from 50 to 75 per cent on their
slock. To-morrow 1 shall attend a meet
ing of the directors of the University of
Illinois. They are fully protected and
will not lose a cent. As far as my liabil
ity to the bank goes, I have deeded prop
erty jn full payment for nuy stock. I have
done nothing to be ashamed of and am
here to face the music, and will stay until
everything is cleared up."
The university trustees will ask some
thing more tangible, and to-morrow's
meeting will be an important one for the
university. Spalding has deeded 200 lots
to Charles Ford, said to t>e Altgeld's rela
tive. The property probably will be soid
for the benefit of the bank's depositors.
At a meeting of the depositors' execu
tive committee this afternoon one com
mitteeman said that about $100,000 worth
of missing bonds had been found.

ROBBED A RICH COUNTY BANK.
Thieves With Smooth Tongues Entertain
a Cashier While a Money-Drawer
Is R fhd.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 12.â The
Yonkers Savings Bank, the richest bank
ins institution in Westchester County,
was robbed of $4400 to-day by three dar
ing thieves. It took the men fifteen
minutes to do the work. Then they
escaped, and their chance of being cap
tured is small, as the only person who
saw them is unable to give descrip- ions of
value to the police. While the clerks
were out to lunch and the aged cashier,
Lyman Cobb, was alone in the bant a
young stranger entered, engaging in an
aimless conversation and holding the
j cashier's attention while a pal rifled an
old- fashioned change drawer in which the
money was kept. It was only when the
conversationalist ran short of interesting
topics that the cashier turned and dis
covered what had been going on behind.
A cocked pistol stuck under nis nose and
a warning mat me least sound meant his
life gave the thieves the moment they re
quired to get safely away.
The cashier, badly rattled, rang the
burglar alarm, within reach all the while,
and waited dazed till the police arrived.
They found a watchman on the Hudson
River front who saw three men row over
to the Jersey shore. Telegrams were sent
to every hamlet on either side of the river,
but up to midnight not the slightest trace
was found. The whole section teems with
busy villages.

ST. LOUIS. Mo., April 12.â The National
Bank of the Republic decided to-aay to go
out of business. At a meeting of the direc
tors an arrangement was made to liquidate
through the Merchants' Laclede National
Bank. The liquidation is directly due to
the recent death of Charles W. Bullen,
president, who had been with the bank
almost since its organization. Its affairs
were so closely identiri' d with him that
he said when he died the bank would prob

This Performance Is the Most

All Bef:re Them.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 12.â The impor
tant town of Bahia Honda, near the big
bay of that name on the northern coast of
I'iner del Rio, has been totally destroyed
by the insurgents after a lively engage
ment which resulted in the surrender of
the garrison.
After taking B.ihia Honda and remain
ing there some hours the insurgents set
fir* to the town and when it had been re
duced to ashes retired to the interior. This
is one of the most important insurgent
successes in the wuole war and the glory
of it may be given to Vidai Ducasse, a
soldier of the aggressive temper of Maceo.
Since the capture of Rivera Ducasse has
kept the Cuban forces in the provinct
constantly lighting.
It is reported here that another expedi
tion bringing supplies to the insurgents
landed safely. Strong Spanisli re-enforce
ments went to San Cristobal to intercept it.
Cuban sympathizers are excited by the
news that the traitor, Miguel Beato, has
i left the capitol to confer with the Cuban
i leader A costs. Beato is charged with
having betrayed a prominent lawyer, Jose
Gonzales Lanuza, Alfredo 'Zayas and
others now imprisoned at Ceuta, and a
host of other?. His mission to Acosta is
believt d to be some new act of treacnery,
and word has been sent to the Cuban
leader to imprison him.
The sanitary condition of Havana is ter
rible. The heat is already as intense as in
the worst days of summer, the tempera
ture rising above 100. This has produce. i
an increase of all epidemic diseases.
Smallpox, yellow fever and scarlet fever
are making serious ravages.
A dispatch received to-day by the Diario
de la Marina from Madrid says President
McKinley recently offered the friendly
mediation of the United States in Cuban
affair*. Castillo, Prime Minister, replied
tharking McKinley for the offer and re
questine tne United States to stop the
work of filibusters in that country.
Joseph Botili, an Englishman, has
been arrested at Santiago de Cuba. Jose
G. Curbelo, an American, has been re

lodged after a sharp tight, retiring with
considerable loss.

DAIS JHlS!tl<>\ JO CUBA.
The Sole Objtet 1% to Inquire Into the
â  itrder of liwlz.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 12.â Word
was received to-day from Judge W. R.
Day of Cantor., Ohio, who is going to
Cuba for thÂ» State Department, that he
will be in Washington the latter part of
the week.
He will spend a few days looking over
reports in the Ruiz case before sailing for
Havana. Judge Day has not been at>-
Vcinied paramount commissioner to in
vestigate the condition of affairs in the
islami. The sole object of the mission
will be to attend the inquiry into the mur
der of Ruia, and to report 10 the President
and Secretary Sherman. An inquiry will
be made according to the forms of law,
and in which Judge Day's high standing
as a lawyer, that brought about the selec
tion, will be snown. There is no inten
tion of sending him on a tour to Cuba to
ascertain the strength of the patriot forces
and the probabilities with regard to sac
cess. The present military situation
makes this practically impossible.
The forces of both sides have been di
vided into small bodies, according to in
formation received here, and it would be
exceedingly hard to get an idea of the
strength of either side. Weyler's troops
have been divided into bands of 100 men
each and distributed at numerous diminu
tive forts along the trocha and towns.
Judge D:iy will not go farther from Ha
vana than Guanabacoa, a suburb where
Ruiz was killed.
It is understood in official circles that
Fitzbugh Lee will return with Day, and
as the latter hopes to get through the in
quiry in a week and return to America
early in May, Lee's stay will be short.
Lee's return will probably mark the end
ing oi his official connection witii the
Government and the appointment of a
successor may be looked for very soon
after. Mr. Springer, the Vice-Consul-
General, will act in bis absence.
JFAssurances have been received that Ona
Melton, a young American confined with
other members of the Competitor crew in
a Cuban prison, will shortly be released.
The papers giving him liberty are await
ing signature in Madrid. There was con
siderable doubt of his intentions to take
iip arms against the Spanish, and his claim
that he went to Cuba to represent an
American newspaper seems established.
His release would have taken place im
mediately but for the assertions of sensa
tional newspapers that their articles had
forced Spain to acquiesce in the release.
A similar case was that of Scovel. He
would have been allowed freedom earlier
if the newspaper he represented had not
subordinated his interest to the desire for
a sensation. George Washington Aguirre,
another young American captured with
the Competitor crew, is also certain to ob
tain liberty. His release has been requested
by the Government as an act of grace. If
allowed to go he will promise to leave
Cuba.

Ihe Appointment of Totter Cause* an
English Wail.
LONDON, Eye., April 12.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Times says
the appointment of John W. Foster and
C. S. II ami in seems to indicate the imme
diate reopening of the Bering Sea ques
tion. It is probable that Foster will pro
pose an agreement based upon a new
modus Vivendi, with firm restrictions
upon Canadian activity The Times, com
menting editorially upon the dispatch,
bays:
"The movement to reopen this question
will be noted with surprise and disap
pointment. It appears premature, if not
unseemly, to start a diplomatic campaign
sixteen months before ihe stipulated time
for re-examination has arrived. To de
mand that an award shall now be set aside
in accordance with the contention of one
party to the controversy would strike a
very serious blow at the principle of
arbitration. Yet .it appears not only
powerful influences are working in the
United States to impeach the award on
perhaps the most important .practical
point, but also these influences meet with
a certain amount of encouragement with
the executive. It must be remembered
the British Government is trustee of the
rights of Canadians.. To allow these rights
to Da whittled away in the teeth of an
award would arouse justifiable indigna
tion in Canada. The attitude of, the
States as to the payment of damages and
restrictions upon the slaughter of s*als on
land is not likely to make Canadians more
favorable to amendments in the award.
"We are forced to conclude that a strong
and bitter feeling exists in America
against Canada,. and Foster, who is an ex
pert in the art, is using the press to create
agitation. Possibly be is reckoning on the
iact that relations between the two Govern
ments is now more strained than usual.
Canada has been hard hit in the proposals
of the new tariff law, and has shown her
self ready to hit tuck. The American jin
goes are eager to prove they can strike an
other blow. We do not see, however, why
the British Government should help them :
by consenting iv unsettle, results arrived
at by arbitration less than four years ago,
and by exhibiting an ostentatious disre
gard of feeling lor our colonial fellow sub
jects." .
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 12.â The

Faith.
Result of a Study of Eastern

How the Big Fish Ara Swallowing
the Sma 1 r Ones by Means of
C ntraiized Wealth.
WICHITA, Kaxs., April 12.-Mr3. Mary
E. Lease, after an absence in the East of
nearly a year, recently returned home.
From a Populist "calamity bowler" she
has developed into a radical Socialist agi-
tator. She has abdicated her once un
questioned post as the high priestess of
Populism because Populism, radical as it
is, does not go far enough in its extremes.
She is in full accord with its various and
visionary isms, but Populism, it will be
remembered, only insists on Government
ownership of railroads, telegraph systems
and oihtr public utilities. Mrs. Lease
does not stop at these demands, but wants
Government ownership of the whole ma
chinery of production.
Mrs. Lease has been a close student of
economic conditions in the East during
her short residence there, and she has
made her observations from a Western
viewpoint. Bbc has been deerly im
pressed with what she has seen of the re
sults of centralization of capital, and de
clares that in every line of trade the great
establishments are Killing off the small
competitors in the same field. As an in
stance of this she referred to the great de
partment store established there recently
by the Chicago firm of Beigel, Cooper &
Co.
While she gloried in the fact that this
fwas a Western institution and that it had
orced New York to admit the supremacy
of the West in business competition, she
declared that it had not only forced store
after store among the smaller retail es
tablishments to close out, bat bad practi
cally closed oat Â«mch old-established busi
ness houses as Ridley's, on Grand street.
She says that in New York and other
cities of the East the great hotels have
closed out the restaurants and the great
mercantile establishments in every lino
have crowded out or are crowding out the
lesser ones.
"They talk about socialism destroying
individuality," said Mrs. Lease. -Great
God! Where is there indiv:dnality under
existing conditions? The next step in
human progress," she continued, "is. for
the people in a collectivo capacity to con
trol the great industries tnat are now in
the hands of the kings of trade. The
transition will be accomplished peaceably.
It is already well under way. Look at the
great lines of railway for whose construc
tion the Governmentâ the people in their
collective capacityâ loaned the money.
Why sbonld tbe men to whom this money
was loaned not be treated just as ordinary
citizens are treated when they fail to re
turn borrowed money within the stio
nlated time? They have not paid back
tbe money loaned them by the people,
and now it is time for me people to take
the control of those properties into their
own hands.
"What has been the usual result when
ever a railroad has been mismanaged and
is thrown into the hands of a receiver, or
in other words, whenever i the people in
their collective capacity have taken such
* road into their control? ThÂ« road hat

been restored to a paying basis and its
employes have received better wages.
Why. some of the old world government*
would laugh at the idea of a private cor
poration owning a railroad! It is not a
revolutionary doctrine after all. The post
orh'ce it) now a socialistic institution, con
ducted by the people for the people's good.*
Time was when the postoftice was not a
branch of the Government service, but
was run for individual profit.
"Socialism is simply the practice of
Christianity. We have theatrical Chris
tianity to-day, but until we put into daily
practice the cardinal principles taught by
the divine master, we need not hope tor
the betterment of the race."
Mrs. L?ase has also embraced the teach
ings of theosophy. Socialism and tbo-a
sophy, she believes, go hand in hand.
Whether Mrs. Lease has solved the prob
lems of civilization is a question that the
future must answer, but there is no doubt
as to the sincerity cf her views.

that the House adjourn at Ihe close of the
sitting this evening for the Easter recess.
Ây Sir Charles ? Dilke denounced the ; Gov
ernment for not giving the - House facili
ties for debating the . motion made by
Harcourt on April 5, wbicb. Sir Charles
said, was â  a motion demanding a vote of
want of confidence and not a vote of cen
sure. Dilke added that the Government
was a slave to the : concert, of the powers
which had failed to coerce Turkey in con
nection with the ouira in Armenia, and
would have ! been similarly imbecile and '
helpless in the Cretan crisis if it bad not
been for the fact that Greece had forced .
their bands. !, r v
Under Foreign Secretary Curzon ex
pressed ihe Delief that the withdrawal of
tbe Greek troops from Crete would lead to
an immediate and peaceful settlement of
the Cretan matter. Regarding; the raid
across the Turkish frontier, Curzon said
that no Greek regulars had taken pare in
the invasion, and the Porte was not anx
ious to make it a casus belli, provided it
was not repeated.
Harcourt said the powers never ex
plained the position they claimed to hold
in Crete. All they hud done was to back
the wrong horse and bombard the wrong
people.
Baifour defended the action of tbe pow

withdraw the Turkish forces from Crete.
This would have been done long ago but

Hearst Declare* Thnt Hanna /Â« Raising
a I'ool In Wnll Street.
NEW YORK, N. V.. April 13 -The
Journal, maintaining its eager bunt for
Bryanite constituents, this morning prints
his hysterical story about tho alleged
preparations of Hanna to steal a march
on the "anti-McKinleyites" lor the next
Presidential campaign. It represents him
as hobnobbing with Wall-street bankers
for a mammoih campaign fund.
It says: "Westerners are talking om
inously of the work already done in the
West for this political blind pool. It is
said a million-dollar campaign fund is
now fairly in siirht. Among the capital
ists whose names are said to head the
lists are: J. P. Morgan, Rockefeller,
Georgo Gould, Russell Sage, Andrew Car
negie, Henry Clews, August Belmont,
George M. Pullman and John Wana
rnaker."
The only apparent basis for the story
seems to be the earnest organization of
branches of the Sound-money League
throughout the country. According to
the story a strong opposition to McKin
ley, headed by Platt, is already developing.
DESERTS WIFE AND BABE
Young Man With an Unsavory
Record on His Way to
This City.
His Wife a M rysvil c Girl and He
Accuses Her of Planning an
Elop m^nt-
DENVEB, Colo., April 12.â Clarence
Merrill Dow, a young man with an ex
tremely romantic career, passed through
Denver to-night en route to San Fran
c sco. He has just deserted his wife at
Fueblo, Colo., after having discovered
what he alleges to be a plot on her part to
elope with another man. The wife's
maiden name was Mac Inlow, and she is
the daughter of Sheriff Inlow of Marys
ville, Ca!.
They were married in San Francisco on
April Â£9, 1893. Dow is a son of C. H. Dow,
president of the defunct Commercial Na
tional Bank of Denver, who is now serv
ing a live years' sentence at the Federal
prison at iort Worth, Kans., for the
wr<>ckinqof that institution.
Youne Dow fir^t gained notoriety by
marrying Millie Price, a skirt dancer with
Donnelly and Girard's "Natural Gas"
Company, while piaying an engagement
in Denver six years ago. At that time he
was only 19 years of age, but was supplied
with large sums of money by bis indul
gent father. Two days later he attempted
to Mhoot his bride.
After various escapades Dow enlisted in
the United States army, tiia dancer hayÂ»
ing secured a divorce. Just four years ago
be deserted the army barracks at Angel
Island, where he was con lined as punish
ment ior some minor offense. Sailing
across the bay in a stolen skiff, be has
tened to meet Miss Inlow and they were
married.
From San Francisco the couple went to
Ban Antonio, Tex., where he was arrested
in August for desertion. The charge was
not pressed, however, as his lather, the
Denver bunker, came to the rescue. In
San Antonio a eon was born to Mr*. Dow,
Later the family moved to Pueb.o.
Family fortunes having vanis ed Clar
ence secured a position as fireman on a
locomotive to earn a living. Lately he
has been acting as brakemau. He says
that in January he became suspicious of
his wife and heard that she was planning
to elope with a stranger, said to be from
Kansas City, and this she is Â«.iid to have
confessed within the past week. Dow
s-iys he goes to San Francisco to accept a
good railroad job. He will take sieps to
.secure a divorce there and obtain the
legal custody of the boy.
RECONSTRUCTING
THE TARIFF BILL
Groundless Rumors That It
Will Be a Sectional
Measure.
Western Members of the Senate
Committee Able to Hold
Their Own.
Interesting Mi hods Adopted by the
SchedulcMakers, Wno Work
Night and Day.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April
tain Western Senators are reported to be
in a creat state of mind over the alleged
purpose of Eastern Senators to fix the
tariff bill to suit themselves without re
gard to the needs and conditions of the
Western section of the country. Those
who know what is going on, however. '
claim that there is no foundation whatever
for the criticisms of the Western Senators.
The framers of the bill claim that when it
is reported back to the 6ena:e it will be!
tound to be a measure to which every Re
publican Senator will ba able to give en
tbusiastic support, and its publication
will cause the charge of sectionalism to
fall to the ground.
There are two able Western men pitted
against two New Euglanders in the com
mittee framing the bill. Chairman Alli
son is certainly a fairly good representa
tive of the Republicans of the West. If he
may possibly be regarded as a little too
conservative in his tariff views, this weak
ness is certa'nly offset by the fact that his
Western colleague on the sub-committee
is Wolcott of Coloraao, a Republican
whose loyal devotion to the cause of free
silver, strong as it was, could not drag
him outside of party or cause him to
weaken in his loyalty to the Republican
policy of protection. Aldrioh of Rhode
Island and Platl of Connecticut are the
New Englauders on the committee, and
while both of them are tariff experts it is
not likely that they would overmatch such
ruen as Allison and Wolcott if there should
be a controversy on sectional lines.
The methods in which the Dingey bill
is being reconstructed are interesting. The
four Senators mentioned, who compose
tue sub-committee, on ftnanca, hold three
daily sessions at the Arlington, where they
utilize for committee meetings the rooms
Known as the Gresharn suite, because they
were occupied by the late Secretary Gres
hain. The committee cccnpy three or four
rooms, the others being used as sort of
reception-rooms. The first or front room
of the suite is assigned to Allison and
Aldrich, the second to Piatt and Wolcott
and the third to the clerk of the commit
tee, S. N. D. North, a wool-tariff expert,
who is assisted by several clerks. Colonel
Tichenor, of the Board of General Ap
praiser', is also stationed in Washington
and attends all the meetings of the com
mittee for the purpose of giving expert
advice. Two statisticians from the Treas
ury Department ars also on duty with the
committee. Meetings are held daily at
it: 3o, 2 and 8 o'clock, so literally the com*
mittee is at work night and day.
It has been announced that the report
will be ready to present to the Senate
about April 20; but there is authority for
the statement that it will be impossiole
for the committee to conclude its labors
so soon and that it will be near May when
the bill is reported. No regular hearings
wili be granted anybody, no formal argu
ments listened to and no record kept or
report made of what is said in committee.
But it is impossible to re/use to listen to
those who comÂ© of Washington in be
halt of various business interests, and so
it happens that the little waiting-room is
filled two or three times a day with repre
sentatives of importers and manufactur
ers, who have informal talks with mem
bers of the committee.
But for the arb trary rules it makes
with regard to hearings the committee
would be overrun with callers, and it
would be found impossible to carry on the
arduous task set before it. As it is, it is
unable to cet to work early, owine to the
appeals of those directly interested in the
bill, and although it has worked diligently
a vast amount of work is yet undone. It
is a custom of the committee after it has
got fairly to work each day to take ud the
schedules icem by item. Statisticians and
clerks make computaiions, Tichenor gives
his advice as to tne effect of the various
Changes proposed, and if the committee is
in possession of full information regarding
the item it is decided, otherwise it is laid
over until the others are disposed of.
The committee has made a sirict rule
not to allow anything wtiatever to be
made public with regard to the rates
agreed upon for any item in the bill. They
are pledged to absolute secrecy, and be
fore disposing finally of an item they go
into executive session, not. allowing even
the committee clerk in the room. Up to
date they have been successful in k ep
ing from the public what they are doing,
and declare that unless one of themselves
betrays the secrets nothing will be known
about the bill until it is reported to the
Senate. Therefore they think that those
now criticizing the bill because the rates
are too low or too high do so without
knowledge of the facts. They are con ri
dent that the bill when completed will
pass muster. Whether or not the charge
of sectionalism is warranted, it is well
known that as a whole the measure will
be much more conservative than that
passed by the House. Rates will be re
duced all along the line.
QUEBX LIHUUIiAL.ISi's MISSION.
Seeks the J'r'aid*nfi Aid to Overthrow
the Dole Jirf/itti'-
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 12.â
mission of ex-Queen l^iliuokalani is at last
definitely known. It is not to secure her
restoration to the throne, but to urge Mc-
Kinley to exert bis influence in support of
a scheme to overthrow the Dole regime
and order a new election for President.
Sue professes confidence thai at such Â©lec
tion she would be chosen.
Her proposition has been laid before
McKinley. The ground on which she
asks him to intercede is that the Dole Gov
ernment wii illegally placed in power
through the undue influence of Minister
Stevens and the crew of the cruiser Bos
ton. The President's only reply to tne
corcmunication so far has been a brief note
acknowledging its receipt.
Captain Palmer said to The Call cor
respondent to-day : "I am sure the Queen
would be only too .-lad to nave the people
of Hawaii settle by ballot the question
whether they would be ruled by their
chiefa or by tne white race in the islands.
If there was a general election and her
name headed one ticket, Kaiulani a sec
ond and Mr. Dole, t.ie third Liliuokalani
would be elected by an overwhelming
majority, an immense majority."
"Would she agree to run for President,
and if so would it not be a tacit admission
of the legality of t c present constitution
and form of government? "
"I tnink if the proposition were
broached she would be strongly urged by
many of her friends and advisers to ac
cept tlie position. She would do this for
the saKe ot her people. She is a most
charitable and considerate woman, and
would willingly sacrifice all her own pros
pects and advantages for the people she
loves so well. We in this country cannot
realize the closeness of ths tie that exists
between the natives of Hawaii and their
native rulers. She stands in the position
of protector and mother to ncr people and
would do anything In the world for them.
It has been said at times that the Queen is
seeking a pension from thia country, I
heard the gracious lady say that she did
not come to America for money, did not
want money and would not accept it. I
believe myself that it she should agree to
accept a pension it would be to benefit her
people, and for no other reason, and that
every dollar she might receive from this
Government or from Hawaii in tlie form
of a pension would co direct to those
who are dependent upon her bounty."

FOR BIMETALLISM
Appoints Three Monetary
Conference Commis
sioners.
Senator Wolcott, General Paine
and Ex-Vice-Presideot
Stevenson.
Interesting Political Personnel of the
Trioâ They Will Shortly Sail
fcr Europe.
WASHINGTON. D. C. April 12.âUn
der authority conveyed by an act "To pro
vide for the representation of the United
Ssstes by Commissioners at any interna
iiunal monetary conference hereafter to
r> â¢ called." McKinley to-night appointed
Senator Edward O. Wolcott of Colorado,
(General Charles Paine of Massachusetts,
and ex-Vice-President Adlai E. Stevenson
of Illinois, Commissioners and envoy? for
the promotion of an international agree
ment for bimetallism.
Tne Commissioners are all well-known
men. AVolcott has made his mark in the
Senate as a forceful speaker and a stu
dent of monetary matters. General Paine
is best known as a yachtsman. He is
wealthy and stands hi^h in Bos
ton huancial and educational cir
cles. He is a director of the Massa
chusetts institute of Technology and is
connected with many other institutions.
Stevenson started to resume the practice
of law at Bloomington, 111, after his term
a* Vice-President ended iast month. He
tvas in Washington recently and saw the
President with reference to the appoint
ment of a commission.
Wolcott Is well acquainted with both
i'iiine and Stevenson. Last summer,
when the Colorado Senator went abroad to
sound the foreign Governments about the
internationsl monetary conference, Paine
went with htm, although this fact has
been known only to a few of the personal
friends of both. Politically, the person
nel of the commission is interesting. Sen
ator Wolcott is a pronounced silverite..
who supported McKlnley in the cam
paign. Paine is a stanch Republican
and a sold man. Stevenson cast hii lot
with Bryan and stumped Illinois for him.
The appointment of the commission is
made under a House amendment to the
Senate bill, which became a law on March
3â one of the last measures approved by
Cleveland. As passed, the Senate act
provided that whenever the President
should determine that the United States
sliould be represented at any international
conference called with a view to securing
by international agreement the fixity of a
relative value between gold and silver as
money by means of a common ratio, with
free mintage at such ratio, he be author
ized to appoint five or more commission
ers to the conference. The sum of $100,000
was appropriated by the bill for the com
pensation and expenses of the commission.
Authorization was also given the Presi
dent to call an international monetary
conference in the name of the United
States. The House amendment which
pave authority for the appointment of the
commission directs the President "if in
his judgment the purpose specified can
thus txÂ» better obtained" to appoint one
more special commissioner. As much of
the appropriation as necessary for the ex
penses of this preliminary commission
was appropriated by the amendment. The
President was given discretion to appoint
as many special commissioners as desired.
Wolcott, Paine and Stevenson will prob
ably not sail for Europe until after the
new Enibassadors to France, Germany
and England have reached their posts. It
is likely that they will leave about May 10.
It is understood that all three Embassa
<iors are friendly to international bimet
allism.
PRESIDENT McX IN LEY'S RETURN.
After an Absence of F.re Days He Is
Again Besieged by the Hordes of
Office- Seekers.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 12.â After
an absence of live days President Mc-
Kiniey returned to the White House
shortly aftÂ«r noon. Since leaving Wash
ington the party has been aboard tbe
Dolphin continuously, except a few hours
yesterday when the President and Mrs.
McKinley stopped off at Leonardtown, a
historic old place in Virginia, where they
intended attending divine services, but
reached the church too late. No busi
ness of any kind was considered during
tbe i rip.
O:i arrival home the President was
driven hurriedly to the White House,
â where a b g crowd of office-seekers was
waiting. The porch was serried as were
the corridor*. The President went imme
diately to his office, where he sent out
word to the throng he would see no one.
This caused general disappointment, as
many Senators and Representatives who
had brought constituents with them con
fidently expecte i to have a few mo
ments with 'he President. When becre
tary Porter announced that no one wouid
be received there was a general rush lor
the door. Nearly every one who went
away expressed the determination to again
visit the White House to-morrow.
Notices were sent around to the different
Cabinet officers that the regular Cabinet
meeting would be helcJ to-morrow. Later
in the afternoon Secretaries Sherman,
Alger. Gage and Wilson saw tne President.
boon afier getting seated at his desk,
Secretary Porier announced that on his
way up the river he and the President
had decided to jut a new White House
rule into effect. The strain of receiving
office-seeieis tiad become too great, and
hereafter the President will deny himself
to office- seekers after 1 o'clock. During
tbe afternoon he will see only those who
have special appointments, and thus en
deavor to get a little time for the transac
tion of important public business. Ac
cording to the amended rules, the hours
from 10 to 12 will hereafter, except on
Cabinet days, be devoted to receiving Sen
ators and Representatives, and general
callers from 12 to 1. The usual reception
to tbe general puolicon Mondays, Wednes
days and Fridays will be continued.

SENATE COMMITTEE VACANCIES.
Strong Combine to Defeat the Republican
P-an of Reorganization â Creed
of the Popu/sts.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 12.â The
situation in regard to filling vacancies in
Senatorial committees has been lurther
complicated by the efforts of the Silver
Combination Democrats, Silver Republi
cans and Populists to bring about the de
feat of the Republican plan of reorganiza
tion. There is one element of weakness
in their scheme which may upset itâ that
is, the creed ol the Poputistic wing of the
aggregation. As the price of their sup
port they demand positions on almost
every important committee greatly m
excess of their numerical proportion to
the other parties. Allen of Nebraska will
not be content unless put on the Appro
priations Committee. Another Populist
thinks he could only be beppy o:i the Ju
diciary Committee, and Harris of Kansas
has his eye on the Pacific Railroads Com
mittee. The Siiver Republicans, too, are
not over-modest. Petugrew wishes to re
lain the chairmanship of the Indian
Committee, and Teller would like to re
main at the head of the Claims Commit
tee, together with a desirable placw on the
Appropriations Committee. The Demo
cratic steering committee, therefore, has
quite :i task to harmonize the differences
of opinion in the allied camp.
The Republican committee on commit
tees has received replies from nearly every
Senator naming his preferences. These
wili be presented at the meeting o: the
commitiee to-ruoirow. The members be
lieve they can reconcile any family differ
ences likely to arise and will proceed with
their plan of reorganization as rapidly as
possible. They are not disturbed over the
plans of their opponents to take control
of the committees. "If they are able to
do it," said one Republican, "let them."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 13, 1897.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's Yaquina as It Appeared Stranded Alongside the Wharf at
Huenemc Yesterday. The Steamer Coos Bay Got In Shortly Afterward and at Once
Went to the Assistance of the Damaged Vessel.
STRANDED YAQUINA
CANNOT BE SAVED
With the First Moderate
Sea the Vessel Will
Go to Pieces.
Lies in Dangerous Proximity to
the Long Wharf at
Hueneme.
Nearly All of the 'Tween-Decks Cargo
Removed by the Steamship
Coos Bay.
HUENEME, Cal., April 12. â The
freight steamer Yaquma, which went
asbore here yesterday, will probably be a
total loss. The sea here has been calm
and there has been no wind or the vessel
would have been in pieces before this, as
it is old and rotten.
Wnen the Yaquina struck a seam was
opened in its side, ana the hold is nearly
full of water. The vessel now lies in ten
feet of water at low tide and within
twenty-live feet of the wharf. Its prox
imity to the wharf adds to the steam
ship's danger, and the tirst moderate sea
or westerly wind will drive it onio that
structure.
The fear of a possible expJosion of dy
namite on board baa subsided. 1 tie
steamer Coos Bay arrived this rooming
and Captain Hall, with Agent Greenwell,
has with boats and an engine and der
rick on the wharf removed about all of
the between-decks freij;Qt, much of which
is valuable. The tug Vigilant, with Cap
tain C. Miner Goodali on board, is due
from San Francisco to-morrow morning.
It is fitted with powerful pumps and will
draw the water from the lower hold to
permit the removal of the balance of the
ireiglit.
Nothing can save the hull. The sandbar
which caused the dinaster to the Yaqutna
mv -t have been formed suddenly, as none
was known to exist near the wharf ore*
vious to yesterday.
The Yaquina left Ban Francisco last
Saturday evening for Los Angelea, and
put into Hueneme to land a portion of its
cargo. Captain Hmkle, the iornier chief
officer of the Santa Koso, was in com
mand, and be at once made for the land
ing. During the night a sandbar had
formed near the wharf, and on this the
steamer struck heavily, damaging its shoe
and warping tbe hull alt so that it was
impossible to work the screw. The
Yaquina being thus disabled, the water
soon made its way into the engine-room
and put out the hres. A half-hour later
the water was up to the main deck and all
hope of saving the yes. c: Jor the time be
ing was given up.
In tbe Yaquina'* hold were ten tons of
dynamite, besides a lot of general mer
chandise. The most valuable portion of
the consignments have been saved, and
Edwin Goodall is of the opinion that the
vessel will also be patched up and brought
back to San Francisco for repairs. Yes
terday Captain C. Miner Goodall went to
the scene of the wreck on the tug Vig
ilant. Wrecking appliances and divers
went down with the Vigilant, and every
thing possible will be done to save tbe ill
fate a steamer.
"Moss Landing and Hueaeme are two
of the most treacherous places on the
const," said Captain Goodall yesterday.
"With one tide the harbor will ailt up in
a dangerous way, and in the next tide the
current will change around and wash out
a channel twenty feet deep in a few hours.
The sea would be perfectly smooth and
no indication of danger would be visible
until probably the underpinning of the
wharf would give way. It must have been
something like this that happened in the
case of the Yaquina. When it struck,
Captain Hinkle called to the wharfinger
to learn of there was more water on the
other side if the wharf and was told there
was. He tnen attempted to move to the
other side, bat struck aeain more heavily
than at first."
The Yaquina was built at Portland, Or.,
in 1882, and at one time was used as a
missionary steamer to Alaska. Alter its
purchase by Goodall, Perkins & Co. it was
put in the coast trade and remained in it
up to a year ago. It was then turned into
a coalboat and held supplies for the
southern boats. Latterly the trade has
increased to such an extent that a boat to
carry combustibles only was found neces
sary. The Alex Duncan was accordingly
taken out of Oakland Creek and put into
the Yaqu.na's place, while the latter was
put into cum mission and started on its
iirstrun last fca.'.irday.
Tbe steamer Coos Bay put into Hueneme
soon after the Yaquina struck and Cap
tain Hall at once went to the assistance of
the stranded boat. An engine and der
jick were ringed on tbe wharf and soon
ail the freight on the 'tween decks had
been landed.

HELD FOR A LINDEN CRIME.
Call Doors Cose Upon a Man Who
Attempted to Murder His
former Wife.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 12.â The pre
liminary examination of J. J. Douglass on
the charge of assaulting his ex-wife with
intent to kill her, was held at Linden this
forenoon, and the accused was brought
back to jail this afternoon for trial, having
been held to answer.
Douglass and bis wife were divorced last
May, the woman obtaining a legal separa
tion on account of ber husband's iazinesÃ
and inability or indisposition to earn a
living for herself and two children. Since
then Mrs. Douglass and her little ones
have been living at a house in Linden,
which is only a few hundred feet distant
from the residence of her ex-husband's
mother. Occupying the same house witn
the divorcee are Mr. and Mrs. Luce.
On ti.e Ist inst., while Mrs. Douglass
and Mrs. Luce were cooKing breakfast, ac
cording to ilie story as it was brought oui
at the proceedings to-day, they saw Doug
lass coming from the direction of his
mother's house. He entered and. briefly
accosting Mrs. Luce witn a "good morn
ing," turned savagely on his former wile,
accusing her of unwomanly conduct. Mrs.
Douglass ordered him out of the house.
He refused to go. She requested Mrs.
Luce to seek for help in order to eject him.
Douglass ordered Mrs. Luce not to stir
and then seized his ex-wife by the wrists.
They struggled and the woman succeeded
In freeing ncr hands. She seized Done
lass by the coat and endeavored to lorce
him backward through the door. He cried
out: "If we cannot live together we will
die together.'* and discharged a revolver
at her heart. The bullet inflicted a seri
ous wound.

SEATTLE, Wash., April 12. â A de

Court in the shape of the report of Special
Master Lorenzo B. Sawyer of San Fran
cisco, who was on I November 30, 1894, ap
pointed by Federal Judge Han lord to take
testimony and hear arguments in what is
generally known as the "Spokane Rate
Case." This whs an action begun by
Holly, Mason, Marks & Co. of Spokane
against the Northern Pacific Railroad to
comply with an order of the Interstate
Commerce Commission providing better
freight rates for Spokane.
In practically every point involved find
ings are made in favor of the railroad, and
Master Sawyer substantially holds that if
the prayer of the petitioners was granted,
under a strict application of such rules of
the Interstate Commerce Commission, the
Northern Pacific would soon be wrecked

Two Years Ago.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 12.â Dennis
McCarthy, convicted of murder in Sonoma
County and sentenced to be hanged on
April 16, was to-day granted a reprieve of
six months by Governor Budd, because a
petition wai presented representing that
McCarthy was of unsound mind when he
committed the offense.
SAN QUENTIN, Cal.. April 12.â 1t is
not likely that Dennis McCarthy, t tie mur
derer sentenced to be banged at San Quen
tin next Friday, will ever swing from the
gallows. Warden W. E. Hale this after
noon received h reprieve for the assassin
from Governor Budd.
While McCarthy is guilty of an atro
cious murder, he has exhibited since
he has been in San Quentin indisputable
signs of insanity.
"His principal hobby is religion," said
Warden riale, "'and while he is not vio
lent he is weak or simple-minded, and he
is led to do things for which he is not ac
countable. Dr. Lawlor, our resident
physician, has examined the man and
found that he is insane."
Governor Budd some time ago had the
doctors from the insane asylums at Napa,
Stockton and Agnews- examine the mur
derer's condition. Their report, which
has been sent to the Governor, bears out
the statement of Warden Hale and Dr.
Lawlor to the effect that McCarthy is in
sane. . â¢ â¢ - â â :-.â 
The doctors found upon examination
that McCarthy's idiotic condition was the
result of a growth of the skull pressing
upon the brain.
Tbe crime for which McCarthy had been
sentenced to die ou Friaay was committed
about two years ago. He cruelly mur
dered George Fox, a ranch hand employed
on a farm near Santa Rosa. McCarthy
was tried and found guilty and sentenced
to be hanged. The case went to the Su
preme Court, which in January of last
year remanded the prisoner to be resen
tenced.

"These are the gentlemen who hare
been looking out for the traffic interests
of ibe Southern Pacific," remarked Gen
eral Freight Agent Smurr io a reporter
who met him aboard the train. "That
means that they have been seeking mar
kets for California's products, and we
thought it would be a good idea to bring
them out here to our State and let them
see something of the country for them
selves. With the exception of a few, ihey
hail from the Eastern, Southwestern and
Northwestern States. Tbe excursionists
include the heads of the traffic depart
ments in the territory which they repre
sent, nnd many of them are now taking
their first trip here â a trip which they
have been very desirous of making and
are enjoying very much. We want to
show tbem the producing regions of the
State and give them a general idea of tbe
lay of the land."
As the visit was entirely unexpected,
no preparation had been made by the
Commercial Association or any other
body of citizens to take the visitors to
ti.e manufacturing and other industries
of Stockton, but Mr. Smurr said he ex
pected they would stop at the wheel
works, as it was on the lias of ths road,
and take a look through it. He pointed
out the flour-mills and informed tbe ex
cursionists that Stockton w..a the great
flour-producing city of the coast.
The last stopping-place was Fresno,
from which town the excursionists ar
rived at half-past 9 o'clock. They started
for San Jose before 12 o'clock, and will ar
rive at Monterey some time to-night. At
9 o'clock to-morrow morning the visitors
will hold a convention at the Del Monte,
which will probably last two days. At
that gathering traffic matters will be dis
cussed. The convention over, they will
go to Ban Francisco.

RELIGIOUS WAR AT
ALASKA'S CAPITAL
Presbyterians Clash With
Members of the Russian
Orthodox Church.
Petitions Sent From S.tka to
President McKinley and
Czar Nicholas.
Ask for the Appointment of a Consul
to Lock After the Russian Ele
ment's Intorests.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., April 12.â
Silka, the capital of Alaska and iba
fountain head of numerous sensational
stories in the past concerning imaginary
Indian outbreaks, now comes to the fore
with a novelty in the line of a clash of
border factions. The new sensation,
which promises to terminate in a clash,
between the Christian adherents of the
Presbyterian missions Mid the pioneer
Russian orthodox, has developed into a
petition from the Russian element to the
"great white chief at Washington, as
well as to his Imperial Majesty Nicholas
11, EmDeror of all the Russians, to bring
about the appointment, of a Russian rep
resentative for service at Sitka.
Recently, according to the petition,
which is printed in full in the Alaskan, a
party of Presbyterians, including Gov
ernor Sheaicley and United States Marshal
L. L. Williams, interfered with the burial
of the wife of Tyee, an Indian, insisting,
that the b jay, before being consigned to
earth, be encased in two coffin.) instead of
one, as is required by the orthodox re
ligions.
In ureing upon the Czar and President
McKinley the needs of an official at SiiKa
the petitioners alleged that they were led
to believe that the country was soon to be
given over entirely into the hands of Pres
byterian missionaries, in the persons of
Judge Brady as Governor and WiJliam A.
Kelly as United States Marshal, and that
the previous performances of these men
had given color to the belief that any in
terference in the future would precipitate
a war between the church factions that
could not but result disastrously.
A census of the city of Sitka, recently
completed for the Alaskan, shows a total
of 1339 persons residing there. Of thene
275 are Americans, 174 Russians, while the
other whites are enumerated as "marines"
44, and the Pinta force 47. There are 28
Chinese and Japanese and 771 Indians.

ONE DOG WORTH
A DOZEN HORSES
Paying Market for Canines
in the Yukon Mining
Country.
Large Numbers of the Animals
Shipped in for Service in
Sledging.
Sell for F^ncy Prices, While Equine
Beasts of Burden Cannot B:
Given Away.
TACOMA, Wakh., April 12.â Dors have
sudcenly become more valu?bie than
Horses in this section of the Northwest.
This unique condition of affairs results
from the great and crowing demand for
flop.- to be used in hauling sedges in the
Yukon country, Alaska. Winle thou
sands of horses for which their owners
cannot get $3 per head are roaming over
the plains of Eastern Washington and
Oregon goo<l-sized canines are bringing
from ?!â¢"> to $30 each in the local market.
At Juneau tutir value is double that sum,
and on the Yukon River a good do? brings
$100. To the Yuson miner the dog nas
become what the reindeer is to the Lap
lander and the pony to the cowboy of
Texas and Mexico â a beast of service and
a most valuable one.
Every steamer sailing for Alaska for
three months past has borne northward
ssverel dozens of canines destined for ser
vice in front of heavily laden sledges.
They are taken by coat to Dyea, at the
head of salt-water navigation, and there
put into harness to assist in hauling the
precious outfits and supplies over the
Chlikoot Pass and down the farther
slopes to the series of fresh-water lakes
forming the headwaters of the Yukon's
tributaries.
Up to May, when the ice breaks up, dog
teams glide over the smooth surfaces of
the lakes with a surprising rapidity, con
-8 dering the loads they ate hauling. There
are portages to be made around dangerous
rapids, and here again their services are
invaluable. Arrived at the central posts,
such as Forty Mile or Circle City, both
men and dogs take a rest, but in most
cases the dogs are soon put into harness
again for Â» trip to the diggings along the
numerous creeps where shining gold is
being washed out. '
The sledgedogs are too valuable not to
be well cared for when care is possible.
Their owners' first thought in this respect
is to obtain for them plenty of food, which
consist:* principally of fish, usually salmon,
caught in the Yukon River by the natives.
An ordinary dog will eat daitv two pounds
of fresh fish. At Forty Mile last winter
dried salmon sold at 20 10 .'.<.Â» cents a
pound, and bacon that was fit only for
dogs to eat sold for 37; : cents a pound.
in some of the larger camps on the Yukon
dog boarding-houses have been estab
lished where the . canines are properly
cared for at from $6 to $15 a mouth, ac
cording to the season and price of dog
food. ;â¢<â¢-, â¢â¢ â¢..:â¢â â¢ - :
The native Yukon dog is much more
valuable than the importations from
Puget Bound. The dogs must be accli
mated in order to stand the ; severities of
the winter. it is found that dogs taken
from Montana and Dakota endure the
Yukon winters, with less suffering than
those bred in the milder climate of Puget
Sound. Two -splendid specimens of na
tive Alaska dogs were brought to Tacoma
a few days ago, their owner Undine it
cheaper to pay their passage on the
earner than to have them boarded at
Dyea during his trip down for supplies.
Tue animals weigh 82 and 83 pounds, re
spectively, the larger one having cost its
owner $117 at Circle City. These animals
are stout, well proportioned and muscled,
and have exceptionally short and heavy
neck?. Their ears are short and lifted
like those of tne Esquimau dog. Their
coats are daik, and. the hair, when not
close, is . smooth and heavy enough to
form a comfortable protection against the
Arctic winters and also the Yukon mos
quitoes, by the side or .which the ferocity
ot the New Jersey variety pales into in
significance. .
An especially prepared dog food, made
out of meal and coarse meat from the
packing-houses, is being manufactured in
the form of a cracker and seems likely to
come into general use in Alaska.
Buckskin moccasins are provided by
many owners to keep the feet oS the faith
ful little draft animals from being worn
raw on the ice and snow. They are about
nine inches Jong and made much after
the pattern of a child's stocking. Pack
saddles are coming into use this spring.
These are so arranged that the dogs can
carry a weight of from ten to twenty
pounds, besides drawing a sled. The sad
dle-bags fall on either side, and straps are
arranged to prevent the pack sliding for
ward or backward. ; /
A Tacoraa dealer naa built up a large
busiutss in the manufacture of dog har
ness. The collar is made to itfp over the
dog's head, obviating tbe necessity of
buckling it about the animal's neck when
the driver's hsn'is are coil and numb.
The collar is made of leather faced with
sheepskin and bluffed with deer hair.
The hames are included in the coil ar and
attached to them are buckles for fasten
ing the traces. On each collar are placed
rings, to which the traces of a dog in the
lead may be attached, making it easy to
drive teams in tandem. Traces to the
harness for native dogs are made of heavy
web material, because the dogs eat the
leather Harness. They ucvour the collars
on sight if permitted. This peculiar
craving makes it necessary to kenp tbe
animals separated when harnessed, so
they will not masticate each other's col
lars. When the web traces become oily
tbe dogs chew even them, and it is only a
matter of time when the web irappings
become food for the hungry caninet.
This spring several ingoing parties have
taken in burros and small botsei in lieu of
dogs for draft and general service beasts.
It is claimed that pony or burro will draw
3000 pounds on the frozen surface of a
lake. Another advantage claimed is that
tbey can be more profitably used as pack
animals daring the summer. A Circle
Ciiy firm works a train of thirteen horses,
hauling from 800 to 1300 pounds each on
sleda and requiring but three drivers. All
returned miners, however, unite in de
clarine that tne do* is holding bis own
well against the competition of toe horse
and wiil be needed there in large numbers
for y-ars to come. It is expected that
within a few years the Government will be
aote to -upply many reindeer from the
herd now established at Point Barrow.
B. M. McClaine and A. If. Steams, two
Eastern, iuiner.Â«, have lost started north
with a ntw kind of freight conveyance.
It is a water and ice craft comoined.
The main part is a box built like a laree
watering trough, eight feet long, twenty
two inches wide across tne bottom, three
feet across the top and twenty-two inches
high. Beneath the box are two rucners
hve inchrs i igh nnd a little ionger than
the bed. The party has six of these con
veyances, which will be used as sleda on
laud and boats on water. For use ia the
water two of the sleds will be joined to
gether by blocks at the ends, making a
stronger water craft. To each side of the
conveyaace a lot; will be attached to ren
der it more buoyant. The troughiike
boxes are made of galvanized iron, and it
is intended to sell them on the Yukon for
bathtub;, the usual p: ice of a bath there
being $1.

WRAITH OF ARGO
IN MARIN`S JAIL
This Time It Is a Woman
Who Sees the Suicide's
Ghost.
Annie Kehoe's Night of Horror
in the Haunted Cell at
San Rafael.
la a Frenzied Effort to Escape She
Dr?gs Her Bed lato Another
Apartment.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., April 12. -Once
again has the chest of Argo made its ap
pearance in Marin's Coumy Jail, This
time a woman, Annie Keboe, saw it, and
to escape from its evil influence dragged a
bed from tbe bauuted cell, where ghastly
figures tannted her, into an adjoining cell,
only to find that the apparition, with its
uncanny scare and lowmoanins, followed.
The woman told her story to Under Sher
iff John Hannon to-day. It is tbe s>ame
as tbat told by other unfortunates who
have been locked in the haunted cell and
been compelled to SDend a night with the
ghostly yisitor.
"I'll bet you a thousand dollars to a
nickel that I saw a ghost, if my life
is worth it," said she in reply to a
taunt tbat she was ouiy dreaming. "I
was lying on my cot when I caw a men
crouching on tbe floor right near the
tanks. I was terribly frightened and the
man was continually moaning. He was
dressed in dark clothes and wore a large,
black slouch hat with a big brim and
seemea to have two coats on."
County Treasurer J. T. Fallon, who was
under sheriff at tbe time prisoner Arco
kii;ed himself in the cell which he is now
said to haunt, was sent for and Annie
Kenoe repeated the description of the
ghost to him. He said that she described
Argo minutely aud that at the time Argo
committed suicide in the cell he had on
two coats and was dressed and looked as
described by tbe woman.
Annie Kehoe was arrested last Thurs
day nipht for petty larceny, she having
been charged with stealing a woman's
wrap. To-day she was before Justice Rod
den o! San Rafael and was acqu tied.
Wlien me returned to the County Jail for
her br-longings sbe showed the Usuer
Sheriff and Treasurer Fallon where the
ghost crouched. Her bedding was on the
floor in tbe adjoining cell, whither she
had dragged it iv her efforts to escape
from the apparition. She said that she
saw the ghost of a Chinaman, also. She
described her ihriliing experience vividly,
and when she le:t the prison this after
noon she exclaimed :
"Thank God, I won't have to spend an
other night in that terrible place."
The ghost has bÂ»en seen by other pris
oners before. Murderer Kellv. who
stabbed a feslow-convict at fcsn Qnentin
i rison and who was tried at San Rafael
ior the crime, sDent a night in the
haunted ceil, and was foundiu the morn
ing by the Sheriff's <leputi-s in a frenzied
state. Ue said a ehost had visited him,
and that he would commit suicide if the
{Sheriff would not taka him ont of the
cell rather than pass such another night
as the one he had just gone through.
Argo, whose apparition is causing all
trouble, was arrested for some petty of
fense and confined in this cell. The next
day hi 9 lifeless body was found on the
llcor, and s-ince that time prisoners have
repeatedly said that th.y have seen his
tjhosU
A Chinaman, who had never heard of
the stories in regard to the cell and who
was unable to read English, related the
same tale as did Annie Kehoe. The mys
tery has never b?en explained, and tramps
without number, who have beard of the
phostly visitor, have given San Rafael a
wide berth for fear of being confined in the
haunted cell.
"I cannot acconnt for it," said Under
Sheriff Hanr.on, "but it is a fact that the
descriptions of the apparition tally in each
instance."
ftounnea for I'nmoin Orchard uf <.
POMONA, Cal., April 12.â The fact that
grape fruit, otherwise known as the Po
melo or Shaddock, has been bringing
about $10 a box in the Eastern market for
several weeks, and has not brought less
than $8 a box this season, has made fruit
growers in this region eager to plant
orchards of grape fruit. There is, there
fore, ten times more planting o! tins
veriety of fruit than ever beiore, while
the acreage set to orange and lemon
groves has not been so small in nine years
as it is this season. Several persons who
have small tracts planteu tp grape fruit
have made as much as $13 per tree this
season. At that rate one ecre of grapa
fruit would ba worth nearly $2900 this
year.

CRITICIZED BARNES
Figures on the Cost of the
District Attorney's
Oifice.
Fewer Cases and Much Greater
Expense Now Than Ten
Years Ago.
Supervisor Rottanz 'i High Hat Ordi
nance Receives Another Severe
Setback.
Mayor Pheian delivered a scathing criti
cism on the m;inner in which the District
Attorney's oliice is conducted in a veto
message tbat was reaÂ«~i at the meeting of
the Board o f Supervisors yesterday. Some
weeks apo when the board appointed Ja
seph J. Dunne as an assistant to Attorney
Barnes (he Mayor objected on the ground
that Auditor Btoderick had announced
.t the special coun-el fund was ex
hau-ted, ana, that as Mr. Dunne was em-
I ioyed on pure-food cases, ue was doing
wo: it that should be performed by ihe at
torney of the Board of Health.
Since then he has been quietly inquiring
inio the methods of the District Attor
ney's department, and the result came out
a.- stated. The message was as follows:
April 9, 1897.
Tit the Honorable the Board of Supervisors of
the City and County of Â»San FranciscoâUestlk
>un: 1 bvrewith return to you, without my
iipproval, demand on the treasury of Joseph
J. Dunne, appointed by you as assistant coun-
Bel to the District Attorney, for twenty-three
days' salary during the mouth of March, ag
gregating $191 66.
Tne reasons for my objections to the pay
ment of this demand are:
First â That the special counsel fund of
$3000 authorized by the law of May 6, 1861,
is exhausted, and this is the only special
counsel fund at your disposal.
Secondlyâ lts payment out of the urgent
necessity fund is unlawful, because the law of
March 30, 1878, creating such fund provides
that the Supervisors may "order paid out of
the urgent necessity fund not to exceed
Â£3000 per month for objects of urgent neces
sity not otherwise provided for by statute, in
lieu. of the amount now allowed by law." As
seen above, special counsel is "otherwise pro
vided lor by law," and allowance for it under
urgent necessity would be illegal.
Thirdlyâ Because the District Attorney has
no urgent or othor need for special counsel.
A special counsel was given to the District At
torney during the Durrani trial for obvious
reasons. When the necessity cease-, the office
should also cease. The District Attorney has
three Uciiuties, a chiei clerk aud two assistant
c;erks, provided for by statute, and the last!
Legislature passed no law increasing his force. i
The Legislature, and not the Board of Super
visors, was the proper body to which lie
iould have applied lor additional assistance,
li such were 'necessary. The following statis
tical information, however, as to the business
nnd expense of the office, shows no such neces
sity. It reveals the luei that there was no in
crease in the number ot cases received during
the past ten years, while the expenses nave
risr-i! Rom $18,416 in 1836-86 to $'25,564 in
ISUS-96.

The following table shows the number of
criminals whose cases ars set for trial in the
various departments lor the month of April,

The number of prisoners Incarcerated with
out bail and awaiting trial is no greater than
at any other time. There necessarily must be
a large number so circumstanced, and it de
pends upon the District Attorney's office to
bring them to speedy trial. Sixty days after
arraignment is not too short and should not
embarrass the office. If there are. more
criminals held in the County Jail awaiting
trial, the number of cases received remaining
substantially the game a* formerly, it would
argue rather that the strict Attorney's
office is not doing as much work as in other
years. Furthermore, nine* his appointment
Mr. Dunne has been detailed to prosecute the
cases brought by the Board of Health against
the violators of the pure-food law; so that the
employment of Mr. Dunne does not servo to!
reduce the number of prisoners held in the
County Jail.
The Sheriff, however, supplies me with this
information:
Number of prisoners on hand awaiting trial
and on trial April 1, 1895 128
Number of prisoners on hand awaiting trial
and on trial April 1, 189t> 126
Number of pri-oneri on hand awaiting trial
and on trial April 1, 1897 77
In a communication to the Board of Super
visors the District Attorney ext>rrgses surprise
that your noiiorable body should hesitate to
assist him in "upholding the criminal law and
Bi'miiiistering justice," and refers to the ob
jections raised against increased expenses as
"narrow quibbles aDout a bagatelle. " If there
is no law ior the payment of his assistant, nar
row quibbles become insurmountable ob
stacles; and If there Is no necessity for an as-
Mstauc narrow quibbles become a pubic duty.
The force at the disposal ol the District Attor
ney, as we have seen. Is sufficient to uphold
the criminal law If the precedents ol other
years be any guide. TheconMant temp'aiion
to create new offices, and maintain unneces
sary ones, is one of the evi.s of our sys-em,
agalnÃt which the Legislature in its wisdom
bÂ»F. in a large measure, protected us. Hale
gunrd* have been thrown about the treasury,
and it takes more than a quibble to break them
dovrn. Respectfully,
" Javk- D. Phelan, Mayor.
Supervisor Rottanzi's high-hat ordi
nance came up on reconsideration, but
after haif an bour of bickering was laid
over for two week-.
The names of Supervisors Rivers and
Lackman were added to those already on
the committee to attend tbe pure-food
congress.
It was decided to hold a meeting of the
committee of the whole on Thursday
evening at 7 o'clock to consider the nar
rnwinÃ of Turk street in tbe Western
Addition.
A resolution permitting Sher:S Whelan
to supply badges in the shape of num
bered stars bearing the words "Sheriff's
Deputy" to bis men was finally passed.
The Committee on Fenders submitted a
report in which the various street railroads
were piven thirty days in which to select
the style of life-savine devices they desire
to use and lay a statement of their action
lefore tbe board. An effort to have thÂ«
FcnderÃ Committee discharged and future
action placed in tbe hands of the Health
and Police Committee was defeated.
Folsom-strert property-owner* requested
that the thoroughfare between Ninth and
Tenth streets, and the crossing of Fol
som and Ninth, Eleventh, Twelfth and
Twenty-fourth streets be paved with bitn
men, and the matter was referred to the
Street Committee.
The Southern Pacific sent in a commu

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 33, 1897.
LOWER FARES TO
THE YOSEMITE
New Route to the Valley to
Be Opened on Monday
Next.
The Journey to Be Made by Boat,
Train and Stage in Quick
Time.
Tourists Will Also B- Enab ci to
Save Considerable in Hotel
Expenses.
Yosemite tourists will hare choice of a
new route to California's mountain won
derland, beginning next Monday. They
will be transported as expeditiously as by
any existing route, while the journey will
be made more enjoyable by reason of thedi
versity of the means of conveyance. From
San Francisco, intending passengers will
be taken to Stockton by boat. Thence a
Valley road train will whisk them to Mer-
Map of the New Route to the Yosemite Valley.
ced, where a coach of the Coulterville
Stage Company will carry them over a
picturesque road to the great scenic val
ley.
The fare over this route has been figured
down as fine as possible, and the cost of
the round trip will be only $29 30. tiy tbe
route via Raymond the fare is $40, while
time consumed is about the same over
both.
Another point strongly in favor of the
proposed new line is that the cost of hotel
b 11s will be materially less at the stop
ping-places en route.
The boats of the California Navigation
and Improvement Company will leave
this City at 6 P. M. and arrive at Btockton
in the morning. Here the trains of the
Valley road will depart at 7:20 a. m and
be met by a well-equipped stage or carry
all at Merced. Departure will be taken
from the latter point at 9:50 A. M. At
Conlterville passengers will put up ior the
night and resume their ionrnev at 6 a. m.,
arriving in the valley a. 4 p M. The en
tire trip will be made between San Fran
cisco ana Yosemite Valley in forty-six
hours. It will be noted that the stage
will run only during daylight.
NopaitiHwill be spared to make this
the most popular route of the cay. As
D. K. Stoddard expressed the disposition
of all engaged in the enterprise: '"We
"hall give tourists all that we possibly can
for their money."
The xtaee ride is replete with interest
ing features. After leaving Merced the
hist attractive point is Merced Falls.
After leaving them the stage threads its
way among rolling hills and through na
ture's parks of oaks, pines, shrubs and
wild flowers. It also passes a large quartz
vein, known as the ''mother lode," said to
run through several counties, and along
which rich gold mines have been discov
ered.
From Coulterville, where tne passengers
will rest for the night, a long hill of easy
grade is ascended, trom the we*t of which
a beautiful panorama of the town and sur
rounding country can be seen. The first
grand view of tbe snowclad Sierras is also
ob aired from this point.
Bower Cave is a freak of nature some
distance beyond Coulterville. It is a
grotto-like formation in limestone about
ore hundred feet in length and ninety in
width. It is entered by an opening in thfÂ»
top four feet wide, through which wild
grapevines and tali maples peep. Down
in tne abyss there is a small pool of water
forty feet deep, on which floats a little
boat.
After leaving this cave the scenery on
the road grows wilder and more beautiful.
Beyond Hazel Green, where there is a
mountain hotel, tiie stage enters the Mer
ced grove of big trees â one of those re
marKable parks of tbe wonderful Sequoia
gigantea found here anti theie among the
forests of the Sierras. Some of these tow
ering trees show a girth of from forty-five
io ninety feet.
At Buena Vista Gap is obtained the
rirst glimpse ol the peaks and mountain
wails of the Yo^eraite Valley and shortly
afterward the big meadows are reached,
where the Indians formerly congregated
in large numbers. Here the stage begins
the descent to tbe Merced Canyon, where
the first view is had of the cliffs that wall
in the foaming waters of the Merced
River.
Two miles this side of the western en
trance to the valley proper the Cascade
Falls are encountered. They are formed
by two streams uniting 700 feet above tbe
road and making tbe leap together. This
is one of the tnoit picturesque spots out
side the val.ey.
The entire road is in fine shape for trav
eling and^will continue so until October.
TO RESIGN AS SECRETARY.
Charles P. Welch Tired of HU Position
in tlir Children's Society.
When the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children meets to-day Secre
tary Welch will present his resignation.
He says he is weary of the criticisms that
have been j.as-ed upon him, and he thinks
it belter that he step out. His resigna
tion is as follows:
San Francisco, Cal., April 5, 1897.
To the Presidtnt and Jii.ard of Directors of the
California Suciety for the Prevention of Crue-ty to
Chiidienâ (iENTi.emen: It id ust have been ap
purent 10 you during the past few weeks ihut
a united effort, hnd been made by certain per
sons to obstruct me in tbe performance of my
duty as your secretary and to place me in a
false position before the people Had you not
cone uded that th<? society could get along, as
it had for m'.ny years, without the services of
n certain subordinate, one whose former em
ployment win not In line with the work tnat
lie was required to do iti your society, and
wnose so-called wonderful efficiency was only
attained after he became an employe ol the
society and working under the orders of his
superiors, tne*e abusive attacks would nut
have been made.
I liave been annoyed a great deal by the un
solicited advic<* of a lot of mcd liesome people
who are not members of your society and who
nave never contributed one cent to its sup
port as to the manner in which 1 should con
duct the office and provide for the unfortu
nate children who are brought under our
notice. This annoyance is and has been so in
tensely disagreeable to me tnat I have con-
C;uded to step out and make room for some
one else. I therelore beg to tender my resig
nation as your secretary, to take effect on the
first day of Mr.y n<xt. In doing ro permit me
to thanic you for the courtesy you have a
tended to me and for the honor of having re
elected me unanimously your secretary in the
fare of tne unjust attacks made upon me by
the malicious persons wno seem disposed to
thwart you in successfully carrying out the
noble work for wnich you are organized. I
feel your action in re-electing me is a condem
nation of the coarse pursued by these unchar
itable and vindictive people.
In severing my official relations with you I
in us i admit Ido so with teelinga of regret. I
think It is best for your society ana best for
my family and myself that I should pursue
the course In this matter that I do. If you
gentlemen did not feel disposed to create a
syndicate for one family so it might control
the entire work for ihe prevention of cruelty
to children and to animals and giving that
family al: the emoluments that migni be de
rived from such a syndicate I certainly am
not to blame. I believe that time will show
that your action in regard to this subordinate,
although too long delayed, was a wise one.
With feelings of respect and esteem for each
and every one of you, gentlemen, I am, yours
very truly, Charles P. Welch, Secretary.
CLEEICAL GATHERINGS.
Transactions at the Ministers' Monday
Meeting*.
At the Presbyterian Ministerial Asso
ciation . yesterday an interesting paper
was read by Rev. J. A. Mitchell on "He
redity and the Use the Pulpit May Make
of It."
Dr. Berry, editor of the Epworth Her
ald, addressed the Methodist ministers'
meeting on "The traits and characteristics
of the newly' elected officers and Bishops
of the last general conference." He spoke,
too, of the necessity of having a few large
I churches in a city rather than many small
ones. He also spoke of the need of loyalty
to Methodism and a spirit of unity with
other denominations. He made some
very apt remarks regarding amusements,
wisely suggesting that the church rather
than the self-constituted leaders of so
ciety lead the young people in social recre
ation. In advocating clean literature he
said that even the so-called theological
novel should be thrown as de, as it only
served as a cover for a great deal that was
not theological.
In speaking of his paper he said that it
had given a surplus of $14,000 to the
church during the last year.
A committee consisting of Rev. Drs.
Masters, Harris and Dills were appointed
to call upon the new Chinese Minister to
Washington and express their interest ia
him and the welfare of his nation.
Mr-. Milnes invited the ministers and
their friends to visit Fruitvale on the first
Friday in May.
Dr. Harris and Dr. Smith returned yes
terday from Honolulu. They report the
work among the Japanese as bein<; very
favorable.
Mrs. Lake of she Methodist Mi?sion
Home hud a nio-t exciting time last Sat
urday afternoon, and if Dr. Masters had
not come to her rescue there is no telling
what would have happened. The rescue
of a slave girl, Choy Sing, had been ar
ranged to take place at 2 o'clock that
aiternoon. According to a prearranged
plan Mrs. Lake walked down tit. Louis
alley and by the den where the girl wa*
coniined. The signal was given and Mrs.
Lake took the girl's hand and started to
lead her from the place. Instantly all the
inhabitants of the vile alley broke loose,
ihe lady looked for the police that had
been promised her, but not one of the
blue-coated guardians of the peace were
in sight. Walking as rapidly as she could,
she blew her police whistle lou<lly, but
still there came no help. By this time
there was an angry crowd at her heeiy,
threatening an.l trying to tear the girl
away. Finally Dr. Masters, attracted by
the crowd, quickly grasped the situation,
and after a hard strugele they finally suc
ceeded in lodging the poor, frightened
but willing captive in the kindly shelter
i.f the mission walls.
BURGLARY AND ARSON.
An Unusual Raid on the Resi
dence of Isadore Good
man.
*
Valuables Were Taken and Then an
Effort Was Made to Obliterate
Evidenc? b7 F.r?.
The Fire and Police Departments have
a mystery on their hands.
Last night at 9 o'clock one of the bed
rooms on the upper floor of Isadora Good
man's residence at 1217 Geary street was
lound ablaze.
In response to a still alarm a chemical
encine and the lire patrol was soon on the
scene and what had promised to be a dis
astrous fire was nipped in its incipiency.
Then an investigation followed which
lirought forth strange results and puzzled
the firemen. It waÂ« of such a nature ihat
the police were notified, and shortly after
ward several detectives were nosing
around the house.
The room where t'e fire bad been for
tunately confined bore evidences of hav
ing been visited by burglars an well as br
fire. It looked as il the unwelcome visit
om had planned to burn the building, in
orrter to cover the traces of their thievery.
A quantity of silverware, that had evi
deutly been thrown aside in the hurried
search for articles ol greater value, was
found strewn about the floor, and quite a
lot of jewelry andcostly ornaments were
mi'sinc altogether.
"This is the third time witbin two
weeks that my bouse has been visited by
marauders," said Mr. Goodman last
night "A weeK ago last Saturday they
got into the place and turned on every
gas jet in the several rooms.
"None of them were lighted and I con
ceive of no reason for this unless it was a
hope that we might all be asphyxiated or
that a lire could be started. Fortune teiy,
however, we discovered what was going
on in time to prevent the carrying out of
the fiendish plot,
"Again laat Tuesday the house was
visited once more, and it must have been
by the same people or person, for the pas
jets were all turned on again. How they
col into the iiou-e to-nig..t I am at a loss
to know."
Some of Mr. Goodman's neighbors saw
a strange man dart out of the house jnat
before the fire was discovered, and the
officials are satisfied that he, either alone
or assisted, was the would- be Incendiary
and burglar.
Mr. Goodman's eldest daughter was re
ceiving company last night and says she
gave orders to the .-ervani-glrl to lock t tie
rear doors early in the evening. This
was done, but when the fire broke out it
was found that all of the doors bad been
unlocked.
Several mysterious attempts hare been
made to rob houses in tiie neighbor
bood of Mr. Goodman's residence of
late, and bis is net tbe only one
in which tbe easjets have bÂ«en
found turned on. Tbe police are working
bard on the case, and are confident ibat
tney will either run down a gang of boid
burglars or a crank.

GEORGIA CAYVAN
PLAYS A RUSTIC
The Blooming Actress in
"Squire Kate" at the
Columbia.
3tis Skinner Proves to Bs a
New and Successful
Richard 111.
"Called Back" Revived at the Alcp
zarâ" The Lily of Kiilarney "
at the Tivo.i.
Georgia Cayvan, buxom and blooming
as ever, made her appearance at the Colum
bia Theater last night and was greeted by
a large audience, which showed much
more appreciation for her acting than for
the pastoral drama in four acts, by Robert
Buchanan, in which she played.
"Squire Kate" is one of those dramas of
bucolic life with which "The County
Fair," "The Od Horn -stead," "Shore
Acres," etc., have rendered the public
almost fatally familiar. Theater-goers
have almost learned to dread the sight of
a farm kitchen, for they know that it por
tends cooking; so when the curtain went
up on the first act, showing a rustic
kitchen interior, every one felt dire fore
bod, ngs, which settled down into gloom
when buxom Miss Cayvan rolled up her
sleeves and began to make pastry.
However, people breathe 1 again when
they found the realism of "Squire Kate" was
not to be carried to the extent of baking
the pastry in a stage oven, to be presently
consumed before the eyes of the audience,
like the turkey in "Shore Acres."
Tlie scene of the drama is laid either in
England or Scotland, where they have
not reached the "Saore Acres" stage of
realism.
The first two acts of "Squire Kate" have
little to distineuish them from the com
monplace run of rural plays; there are
some pretty sentiments expressed in
pretty pastoral surroundings, and the ac
tion drags a little.
Toward the end of the third act there Is
a tnriiling scene for the star, to which she
does full justice, and the fourth act has
plenty of action, though the audience has
not much difficulty in foreseeing how it
will all end.
Miss Cayvan's strong scene occurs in
the hay field. Squire Kate, who has
toiled ami worked ami worried to bring
cp her little sister Hetty like a lady, is
suddenly left a fortune. "Gaffer" Kings
ley, the miser of the village, asks her hand
for his step?on. George Heathcote, and
Kaie, who loves the young man, joyfully
accepts what she fondly believes ia an
offer from George.
As she leans over the gate in the glow
of the sunset Kate sees her sister and
George together in the bavfield, hears
George's words of love and realizes that it
is Hetty that George loves and not her.
Wlien the lovers part Kate turns on
Hetty and upbraids her almost tragi
cally for winning away the man she loves.
"If your hands are white it is because I
have toiled and grown old to make them
so."
The reproaches culminate in a scene
where Kate almost strikes Hetty and then
fallÂ«, fuintini!, to the ground.
All through the play Mis-* Cayvan acted
Kate as a rustic, but cleverly steeied clear
of uncouthness. In the scene at the gate
she was stronely pathetic and passionate
without verging on the dangerous border
line oi melodrama. The curtain calls she
received at the end of this bit of acting
showed thÂ« appreciation of the audience.
Mis* Cayvan has evidently studied the
local coloring of "'Squire K.ite" in the
British Isles; the very willow-pattern
dishes in the kitchen show it. The girls
working in the hayneld is another bit of
local coloring whic;i is un-American.
The play is wholesome and pretty and
the characters are not borrowed, but
"Squire Kate" might be more exciting.
Tne company supporting the star is a
pood, all-round one. Worthy of special
mention was the Hetty of Miss Mary
Jerro:d and the "Gaffer" Kingsley of
George Woodward. vVilliam Uuoert was
good in the role of a Scotch shepherd and
Albert Brown was toucbingly realistic as
t4 tax collector, wiio went ona gilt-edged
"jag" because the heiress would not give
him her hand and lortune.
At the Baldwin.
It seems a pity that but so slim an audience
snould have witnessed Skinner's admirable
interpretation of Richard 111. Inclination or
demand of a fickle public to the contrary,
Skinner is before ail a legitimate actor.
His Richard 111 proved this. It showed care
lul study and tlie rare gift of intelligent rend
ing. Willie not a great characterization,
thtre is so much promise in the interesting
handling of the role as to make the lovers of
the legitimate hope that the young actor will
persevere in the line to which he is so admir
nbly tilted.
Skinner's Richard is above all a crafty,
mocking tiend. He is more cunning than
cruel. His desire seems more to deceive and
gain a fair-spoken regard than to boast of his
many murderous deeds.
He would injure devotion rather than
drehd, and by a hypocritical benevolence gain
the confidence that permits ot bloudy, fiendish
acts.
In his scene with the poor sorrowing Anne
he was at his best. The strange wooing was

CHAMPION FLY-CASTER.
Attorney Manafltld Is Confined to His
Home With a Scarred
Face.
Local anglers will reeret to learn that
Walter Mansfield, the champion fly-caster
and president of the Fly-Casting Club, is
confined to his home, where ha will re
main for some days, the result of an acci
denton the Suiroline last Friday evening.
Mr. Mansfield was ri ling in from the
beach with his wife, and when the col
lision recurred he was sitting near a
stanchion which was struck by the car
that bud "jumped" the irack, with the
result that Mr. Mansfield's face was badly
disfigured by the flying glass.
HÂ«? carries a deep c;t on the forehead,
another across the nose, and a deep gash
in the cheek, besides several small pieces
of glass imbedded in the skin of his face.
The physician states that he Will carry
the marks of the scars for several days,
but Mr. Mansfield is very well
that his injuries are not of a more severe
nature.
His wife, who was sittinp next to him,
escaped without a scratch. The Fly-Cast
ing; Club will meet this evening in the
Flood building.

DESIGNS HAVE
BEEN ASKED FOR
Donahue Memorial Foun
tain to Bs Built
Soon.
Plans to Be Presented for Adop
tion Within the Next
Thirty Days
A monument worthy of the subject, as
well as beautiful and appropriate, will
shortly be erected in this City dedicated
to the mechanics of Sin Francisco in
memory of the late Peter Donahue, tha
pioneer citizen and banker who founded
the Union Iron Works. Designs have been
called for and must be submitted within
thirty days.
The donor, his son, James Mervyn
Donahue, who died several years ago, left
$25,000 for the purpose indicated, and
charged his friends, Peter J. McGlynn and
John F. Burgin, with the carrying out of
the trust. The monument, in accordance
with the wi*h of the deceased, will be a
drinking lountain, and will be erected in
the heart of the business part of the City
on a lot formed by the intersection of Bat
tery, Bush and Market street.-, and do
nated by the City foi that purpose.
The piece of ground is amply lar^e for
the fountain, being 67 feet on Batter/
street, 125 feet on iiusn and 105 fact on
Market street, and when the fountain
shall be well under way the City will ba
asked to build a sidewalk and curb around
it, so that a grass plat may glauden the
eye of ttie passer-by.
The executors of this pleasing trust have
ju3t issuea a circular to anist.t and sculp
tors asking for design;* for the fountain.
The contest in this regard will be confined
to California.
"Peter Donahue came to California
when he was s poor man," said Mr. >lc>
(iiynn iast nit:ht, "and he made ail his
money here. He loved California and so
did his son, ana for those reasons we have
decided to have tne design made by a
Californian. We have been urged by
many people to open the competition to
the world in order, as they say, we may
be assured of a high work of art, but I
think we have sufficient talent in Califor
nia to lurnish us with the desien. Wa
want something not only artistic but at
tractive, so that tourists and other per
sons coming into this City cannoi fail
notice and admire it."

Jt sterns the Grpek soldiers who crossed

How tedious and stale the tariff discus
sion is to Congress is made evident by a
story told of Congressman Cannon. Hav
ing been congratnlatod on bit recent
speech on the i)ingiey bill, he replied:
"Yon surprise me. If you had been here
two years ago you would have â  heard :me
make the same speech, and if you had
been here four years, .six years or eight
years ago yon would also have heard me
make exactly- the same speech, and the
Lord only knows how many men used
*Â£Â»t BDecch before 2 did," . ..
THE CURRENCY QUESTION.
According to dispatches from Washington an intimation was eiven on Sunday
I that Speaker Reed will not wait until Congress reassembles in December to name the
standing committee! of the House, but will do so as soon as thÂ« tariff bill is ont of the
way. It is added that the Speaker also intimated that the Committee on Banking
! and Currency may be authorized at thi3 session 10 sit during tne recess in order to
prepare a bill providing for reform in the banking .-.nd currency system.
This is good enough as far a* it goes, but it does not co by any means as far as
the popular desire. It is the unmistakable wish of the people that the House should
resume business without waiting for the Senate to finish with the tariff bill. It is
also the desire of the people that the subject of international bimetallism should be
considered at the tame time as qnestions of reform in banking and currency. The
two issues are so closely allied they cannot well be separated, and action on the one
should be coincident and closely related to action on the other.
To postpone the appointment of committees in the Houso until after the Senate
has acted on the tariff is a very indefinite postponement indeed. 4"here is much busi
ness before ihe Senate. It i 9 now engaged in considering three appropriation bills, a
bankruptcy bill, the arbitration treaty with Great Britain and ttie tariff. It will be
many weeks and possibly several months before the Senate disposes of the tariff, and
it certainly is not good policy from either the standpoint of statesmanship or of party
politics for the House to remain idle all of that time.
With tbe present prospect of expensive and costly wars in the near future, the
European power?, already heavily overloaded with debts, will be more inclined than
ever to favor some proposition for broadening the base on which the monetary system
of the world rests. ThiÂ«, therefore, is a mo*t opportune time for summoning an inter
national conference for the remonetization of silver,, anl it will be a grievous mistake
to permit it to pats without taking advantage of it.
That there is a widespread popular discontent with the inaction of the adminis
tration on the money question h shown by the uneasiness and uncertainty which
exists not only among genuine b:metallists, but in the opposing camp of the gold
standard. A circular was issued last week by leader of the gold-money party urging
that pressure snouid be brought to bear upon Congress to proceed at once to carry out
the plans of the Indianapolis conference for definitely establishing our monetary system
upon the single gold basis. This shows that even the gold men are not satisfied with
the existing condition of things, and it is not improbable that the Democratic success
in many of the recent city elections may have been due to the fact that dissatisfaction
with the delay of the administration in dealing with the money question caused many
Republican voters to stay at home and permit the elections to go by default.
To sum it all up, the money question must be dealt with by Congress and the
administration before the Congressional elections of 189 S. There is none too much
time before that campaign begin3 # for tha accomplishment of the work, even if the
beginning is made now. It is therefore a matter of urgent necessity, fom the stand
point of party politics, as well as from the standpoint of business and statesmanship,
for Congress to enter at once upon a consideration of ttie problem.
THE KENTUCKY" SENATOESHIP.
The Senatorial election in Kentucky has
ceased to be interesting to the people. It j
has reached the point where it no longer
amuses as a farce and it fatigues imligna
tloa when considered seriously. It has
passed through a dozen different stages, j
each succeeding one of which has been
more disgraceful than its predecessor, and I
a point has now been reached where the ,
best thing that can be done would be for
the present Legislature to abandon the at
tempt to elect, a Senator and leave the
question to be decided by the people when (
a new set of legislators are chosen.
Bad as the condition of affairs is in
Kentucky, it is not worse than in some
Other States. Indeed, the Senatorial con
test in Oregon was even worse, if there
can be any degree of badness in such !
cases. Tbe Kentucky Legislature has j
managed to transact some business, even |
thoueh it cannot elect a Senator, while
tIM Oregon Legislature did not even sue- !
ceed in organizing itself, and transacted
no business whatever.
It has become evident that in many
parts of the Union the existing ma
chinery for the election of Senators has
broken down. It has been several years
since there was a full Senate. At each
succeeding election one or more States has
failed to elect a Senator, and has there
fore had but a partial representation in
that body. This condition of affairs is by
no means confined to the West. Dela
ware, in the East, has been as bad as Ore
gon or Kentucky, and the means by
which her legislators managed to break
the deadlock is by no means creditable,
either to them or to the man whom they
elected.
The one consoling feature of these evils
is that they tena to emphasize the need of
a revision of the constitution so far as it
affects the election of Senators. It has
long been a subject of complaint that the
Senate baa ceased to be representative of
the people. It in a matter of common
scanJa! that Senatorial elections have
been largely determined either by briber}
or by systems of log-rolling which are
hardly better. This being the condition
of affairs, there will be comparatively
little regret over the evidences given that
the present system of electing Senators is
as ineffective as it is sometimes vicious.
At the time when the constitution was
adopted, tho election of Senators by State
legislatures was founded upon good and
sufficient reasons based upon conditions
then existing. Those conditions have
long since passed away, and there I*,
therefore, no longer any reason why
Senators should not now be chosen by the
votes of the people. The present dead
locks will add strength to the movement
for brincing about this reform, and to that
extent the conflict in Kentucky with all
its accompanying scandals may be ac
counted on the whole as a public benefit.
AN ALASKAN POLICE.
It is reported from Chicago that the
United States Government will organize
in Alaska this summer a police lorce for
the purpose of protecting American inter
ests and American miners in the gold
regions ol that country. The report is
said to te based upon information given
by men who are closely related to Secre
tary Gage, and may, therefore, be re
garded as resting upon reliable authority.
It is certainly time that the United
States Government should establish a
police force in the Alaskan sold district.
The Canadians have long had such a force
on their side of the line, with the result
that air lawless and desperate characters
have been run oat of the Canadian min
ing districts and now constitute a serious
menace to Americans. It is, moreover,
asserted by American miners that the
Canadian authorities have exceeded their
jurisdiction and have not infrequently
imposed onerous burdens on Americans. '
It will be remembered that last fall
American residents of Alaska petitioned
Congress for permission to elect a Delegate
from Alaska to the House of Representa
tives. The petition stated that Territory
has many interests of which Congress is
ignorant or to which the members are in
different, and therefore the Territory
urgently needs a Representative in
the Government at Washington. That
this petition well founded is beyond
question, and it is to be hoped that the
present Congress will givj it favorable
consideration. *
With a Representative in Congress and
with an efficient United States police to
protect the interests of American miners
and merchants Alaska would -rapidly ad
vance, both In wealth and population. It
is now well known that the Territory is
by no means so barren and worthless as
was at one ' time supposed. It has many
natural resources, and has the possibilities â 
of becoming an important section of the
Union. It certainly merits every assist
ance which thÂ« Government can . give.
The establishment of an adequate police
will be a long step in the right direction,
and it is gratifying to learn that the No--
Kin ley administration intends to tare
that step with commendable' promptness
.and rigor.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 13. 1897.
ENGLAND AND GERMANY.
The announcement that there nas been
organized in England an association
known as the British Anti-German League
is another evidence of the growing antag
onism of the people of the two countries.
This antagonism is not merely one of sen
timent. It is the outcome of rivalries in
business and colonial expansion in South
Africa, and does not lack for cause to ir
ritate it and aegravnte it into a serious
menace to the continuance of peace be
tween the two empires.
The tone of the German press toward
England has long been bitterly hostile,
and the remarkable letter which Kaiser
William sent to President Kruger at the
time of the Transvaal raid shows that the
German newspapers reflect pretty clearly
the 6entiruent of the coverriing powers.
Ever since the publication of that letter
there has been more or less indignation
among the English people and ample ev
idence has been given of a willingness to
fight Germany on the slightest provoca
tion.
The development of a German colony in
South Africa is a thorn in the flesh of the
Britiih people, who have been seeking to
build up a new empire in that continent.
They have seen in the German settlement
the most formidable obstacle in the way
of the realization of the dream of a Bouth
African colony hardly inferior in wealth
Â»nd population to the mighty colonies of
Australia and Canada. Germany in South
Africa allied with the Transvaal is an
enemy whom even Great Britain hesitates
to attack, and this colony, therefore, as
mnch as the Emperor's letter to President
Kruger, is a source of incessant irritation.
Another cause of rivalry is tne rapid ex
pansion of German commerce in countries
where Britain had once a most a monop
oly. German trade in South America and
the Orient is rapidly increasing, wnile
that of Great Britain remains compara
tively stationary. A thorough protective
system has built up a manufacturing in
dustry in Germany superior to that of
England in many things and hardly in
terior in any, while a system of liberal
subsidies on exported goods has enabled
her merchants and producers to drive the
English out of many of the world's mar
kets.
This condition of affairs rasps the Eng
lish in their tenderest spot. It affect*
their trade, their industry, all along the
line, aud taken in connection with the
resentment aroused by the Emperors
speech and the hostility ot tne German
press affords nn easy explanation of the
organization of the Anti-Germau League.

A KiNGS CiGARS.
Chicago Record.
At the dinner which he gave to the Cabinet
last week the President brought out a box of
cigars that were fully eight inches long and an
inch and a half in diameter. Several of the
guests who are tough old smokers, like Mr.
Gage and Mr. Bliss, Mr. Hanna and Colonel
Herriclt of Cleveland, undertook to smoke
them, and say that their flavor was very fine,
the finest they had ever tasted in a cigar, but
one would lest a whole evening, and they did
not have time to smoke more than half way up
beiore they were called to rejoin the ladies.
These cigars were received last week by ihe
President from a manufacturer in Havana and
were a part of an invoice made to order for
ike Emperor o! Austria, wh.g likes lvi cigtxs
long, fat and strong, end pays $20 for a box
containing only ten cigars", or $2 per cigar.
The tobacco is of the finest quality to be ob
tained in Cuba. Tne cirars are made wiih un
usual care, and there is just as much tobacco
in ten of them as in a box containing 100 or
dinary sl2od cfgars. , The President received
these through a friend who happened to have
been visiting in Cuba, and was asked by the
manufacturer to bring them to him.

TWO NEW LAWS
TO AID THE CITY
A Free Markst on the
Water Front, and Paid
Firemen.
Harbor Commissioners Will Be
Petitioned to Build on Lom
bard Street.
M-.n7 N?w Firemen Wiil Probib'y
Ec Hired After the First
of July.
There is considerable interest in politi
cal and commercial circles as to two laws
passed by the last Legislature: the act re
lating to tire departments and providing
for increasing their efficiency, and the act
authorizing the Board of Harbor Com
missioners to establish a free public mar
ket on the water front.
There is a great deal of speculation as
to the outcome of the free public market
proposition because commission mer
chants in eeneral will oppose it, and they
may even try to enjoin the Commission
ers from carrying out the law. Aside
from this fact the Commissioners them
selves feel that they have their hands full
already with the construction of the new
ferry deport, and Commissioner Chad
bourne is iuclined to took upon the new law
as a vexation and annoyance likely to re
sult in unpleasant legal entanglements.
"In the lirst place," said he yesterday,
"there is no adequate place for what is de
manded, and in the second place I am
almost sure we would be enjoined by the
commission merchants from trying to
carry out the provisions of the law.
Again, we' are very busy, and it seems im
possible to think of doing anything in the
line indicated just now."
Eneinoer Howard C. Holmes of the
commission has not yet been instructed
to do anything in the matter, though he
has beard that there is talk of surveying
in the vicinity of seawall 4, adjacent to
Lombard street. All this, however, Is
still "in tne clouds," as the old phrase
runs.
The rjrovisions of the law are very broad,
however, and oi a character to appeal to
the grangers. The bill provides that
there shall be Â«et aside a sufficient num
ber of piers for the reception of perishable
product?, poultry, game and dairy
products, which owners may sell there
without paying any ice whatever.
Property-owners in the vicinity of Lom
bard street are much interested in having
iLe Commissioner:* take steps in the line
mapped out by the law, and it is probable
that there will soon be an organization to
agitate the building of such a market.
The law seeing to be mandatory, the
word "must" occurring in one place and
"shall" in another, with reference to thÂ»
duties of the Commissioners.
Equally interesting la the new law au
thorizing the Board of Supervisors and
Fire Commissioners to make the Fire De
partment a fully paid one and up to date
m every detail.
San Francisco is the only city west of
Chicago that has not a fuily paid depart
ment, and moat of its buildings are
made of wood. The new law gives the
City authorities wide scope, and those
who are weil informed say that great
changes for the betterment of the depart
ment may be looked for after July 1. For
example, engine-house 2 will have about
ten fully paid men in lieu of three, as at
present, and ao on throughout the City.
These changes are not likely to occur
before July, because there are now no
funds with which to meet tne increased
expenses. The new bill provides that the
Supervisors, "in order to provide the nec
essary funds, may make all necessary and
supplemental appropriations, allowances
and payments in addition to those now or
hereafter authorized by law."
No bills passed in recent years are likely
to be more tar-reaching than the two fore
going. The outcome of both wiil be
watched with great interest by thousands
of people. ____^____^^__

A Rfform in the National Banking
Liws Demanded for the G od
of the People.
Nayal Officer Colonel John P. Irish has
returned from a trip to the East, whither
he went as a delegate to the monetary
convention at Indianapolis.
Colonel Irisa arrived here in good
health and spirits, and more in love with
California than ever. He Jeft the East
last Tuesday and found bleak winter Irom
north ana west of Baltimore until ho ar
rived in California. While away he paid
a good deal of attention to the financial
problem, and gathered many interesting
and important data.
Business men of the East say that the
revival of business prospects must be
based upon reform in the banking and
other Jaws. The monetary conference
asked that Congress, by joint resolution
or bill, authorize the President to appoint
a monetary commission, consisting of
eleven citizens, to investigate the currency
and banking legislation of the country,
which has been mostly emergency legis
lation since 1562, and which has resulted
in an inadequate banking system.
"Business men have concluded that it
is their duty to tdke up the matter and
secure legislation that will give us a more
suitable banking system that will do equal
und exact justice to every part of the
country and to every class cf business,"
added Colonel Irish. "Our present sys
tem is a failure as an instrument for dis
triouting surplus capital so that it may
be in reach of all business men in all
parts of the country. Equity requires that
all business men in all parts of the coun
try shall have equal convenience and ac
cess to the use of their credit in their
business.
"It is the lack of this access that has
given rise to the prevailing error that
there is a dearth of money in thÂ« coun
try. There is no scarcity of mouey, but it
is congested in the big centers, where the
merchants and manufacturers have cheap
and convenient use of their credit, while
business men who are far away nave not.
There should be no reason why money
should be plentiful at \]^ per cent in New-
York and scarce at 10 per cent in Texas,
where there is a stricture in distribution.
"The committee has every assurance
that Con cress before the adjournment of
the session will give to the President the
authority to appoint such a commission,
consisting of expertsâ men of *uch char
acter and experience that their conclu
sions will impress the country and win
t:ie favor of Consres?. The work of this
commission will have behind it the entire
force of the busiues3 men of the country.
"Statistics show that the advance by 1
the retail dealers in the selling price of 7
their goods when they give credit is Uo per
cent. This the farmer is obliged lo pay,
and oftentimes in order to do it he has to
fund his debt in the shape of a mortgage
upon his land at 10 percent.
"The National banking system should
be made the instrument for maintaining
the currency in circulation instead of tak
ing it out of circulation, as in the case
now. Thenumuerof small banks should
be increased, and thes should be given a
chance to live."

IRISH OPERA TO

A Romantic Work That Has Made

ia the East
French opera has come and gone, and
now San Francisco is to heat Irish opera,
the latest fad in the musical world.
It was "Shamus O'Brien," Villiars
Stanford's lyric drama, that set the fashion
for Irish opera. The work Wf.s first pro
duced at the Opera Comique, London,
thirteen months ngo, and the title role was
played by Dennis O'Sullivan, the Cali

conquered London, after which they suc
cessively did the same with Liverpool,
Dublin and New York. Irish opera be
came the fashion; it wai popular to sing
"The Wearing of the Green" and other
national Irish melodies in swell drawing
rooms, and other composers suddenly
woke to the fact that tr.ough Sir Villiars
Stanford had "discovered" Ireland as the
scene for successful opera he had no copy
right on the Emerald Isle.

season of "Sbamus O'Brien" Dennis
o' Sullivan decided to pay a visit to Caii
fornia. lie is expected to arrive to-mor
row. Aa soon as the Tivoli management
heard of his plans, negotiations were at
once entered into for producing "Shamus
I O'Brien" here with O'Sullivau in the title
I role. These negotiations came to a happy
I conclusion yesterday, and on Monday
week the opera will receive its first Cal
ifornia production at the Tivoli, and Den
nis O'Sullivan will be seen in the part
that he created in London nnder Uie direc
tion of the Jate Sir Augustus Harris.
"Sbamus O'Brien" U a lyric drama of
the most modern description, but it is full
of molody from end to end. The melodies
art not taken from the lovely Irish folk
songs, but tl.ev are written in imitation of
them. "The Wearing of the Grean" is
suggested several times in the orchestral
score, and the composer b said to have
shown marvelous subtlety in the way in
which be has repeatedly suggested the
national Irish music. Supreme among
the effects is the wild, weird, plaintive
music of the banshee, which is said to fill
the bearers with a fearsome sympathy.
The composer has made the tenor the
Tiilain and tbe barytone the hero, which
is a reversal o! the usual custom. Shamus,
the ideal hero of so many Irish genera
tions, is said to have found an ideal im
personator in Den r.ii O'Sullivan.
At every turn of the patriot's fortune
the melody rises or falls, narrows or
bioadens, in correspondence with the
â¢vent, and at last a worthy climax comes,

striven to bring poor Shamus to the gal

It is a rather singular fact that Irish
composers, such as Balfe and Wallace,
did not turn to their native land as the
scenes for opera. Since the success of
"Shamus O'Brien' 1 even French compos
ers have looked to Ireland arid to Irish
melodies for inspiration. One of the most
successiul French operas produced during
the last few months had its iocale iv the

The interest of the truly charitable is
awakening on behalf of thÂ« unemployed
and the Balboa boulevard fund. Several
societies of laleme'.l people have organized
entertainments, the proceeds of which are
to go to the fund and many merchants are
entertaining tho idea of contributing in
coin to keerj up the work. The utility of
the work in progress and the needs of the
unemployed are gradually appealing to
the most conservativecitizens. Still there
should be no delay in contributing. At
the present rate the fund will soon be ex
hausted.
Yesterday witnessed the heaviest pay
roll since the work began. It included
f'.tTo for teamwork done during the past
week and the wages of the men who
worked the previous day. Altogether the
payroll reached Xl">00 and more.
The teamwork has been one of the creat
es: necessities, and after the contractors
donated so much work they could not be
expected to go ahead and complete the
boulevard. The teams are required 10
haul the macadam, and more particularly
to haul the earth from t tie cut of the big
till, the culvert lor which will soon be
completed.
These teams must be engaged from now
on, as it is absolutely impossible to work
without them. To keen them at work
means the collection of more money.
There are hundreds of men who have
not yet been able to get work tickets, and
unless more funds are forthcoming at once
there may be men who, though most
worthy, may not l>' relieve 1 by even so
much as a a'ny's work. It must be under
stood that there are more than 3000 appli
cants lor work tickets, aim ali of them
cannot be given employment at once or
pome of them at nil, perhaps, unless the
fund should be readily increased.
A large number of people inspected the
work on Sunday, and were gratified with
the results already achieved.

MRS. CRAVEN WINS
HER JURY TRIAL
Delmas' Successful Argu
ment Before Chancel
lor Slack.
Attorney Charles S. Wheeler
Found That He Was Not
Able. to Refute It.
N.'Xt Mcndpy the Trial of lite Great
Fair Estatj Case Will Be
Commenced.
D. M. Delmas made a strong and win
ning argument in fator of impaneling a
jury in the case of Angus and other Fair
estate managers against Mrs. Nettie R.
Craven for the purpose of passing on ques
tions of fact involved. Judge Slack
granted Mr. Delmas' motion and the work
of selecting a jury will begin next Mon
day.
Mr. Delmas said that the issue to be
tried now ia raised by the intervention of
M:s> Virginia Fair. This issue, according
to the opinion of the court, ii equitable in
its nature, the sole question being this:
'â¢Are the deeds forged ?"
The property involved has a value that
is admitted to produce a net rent of $48,000
a year and it is charged that the deeds to
this property were produced through the
conspiracy of three persons. Thus it will
be seen that the decision in this proceed
ing will involve not only the civil and
property rights of the defendant, but also
the good name and even the liberty of the
persons named in the three complaints in
intervention. There could be no doubt
that criminal charges would be inconti
nently pressed against these persons
should the decision a.- to the genuineness
of the deeds go %gainst the defendants
in i in- case.
Mr. Delmas respectfully submitted to
the court that tins was a proprr case to go
to a |Urj, so far as a jury could act, and
in that sense he appealed to the discretion
of tue court to grant Mr*. Craven's re
quest.
Authorities were quoted to show that
when the genuineness of papers is in
question it has been the custom in chan
cery practice to refer such question to a
jury.
It was developed that in New Hamp
shire, Texas, Georgia and some other
States it is regarded as a constitutional
right to grant a jury in such a case, but it
wan true that any verdict thus reached
was merely to satisfy the conscience of the
chancellor. If the verdict should not be
satisfactory to the conscience of the chan
cellor it might be set aside. The same
law does not apply so strictly in this
(state, aud it was not stated to be the con
stitutional right of any litigant in Califor
nia, yet the authorities go to show that
the granting of a jury has been givÂ«n in
order to give the htigints on both sides
the best character of trial. In this sense
v jury may be called to decide matters of
fact.
If the deeds in this matter are found to
he fraudulent t lie three persons accu-ed of
conspiracy would practically be convicted
of crime. Tliey ought, therefore, to be
before a tribunal ol the same character
that would finally be called on to decide
the question of their innocence or guilt.
This granting of the assistance of a jury
by the chancellor arises from no want of
confidence in himself nor constitutes any
impeachment of bis ability. It is simply
an appeui to the old.Anglo-Saxon plan <>f
a trial by jury so fur as certain issue* of
fact are concerned. This right of trial by
jury originated in Kngland, and has
spread throughout the world, and so
strong has it become intrenched in the
beans of the people that wherever it has
once been tried it has never been deserted.
It is popular in certain quarters to
sneer at the uncertainty of the verdict? of
juries, said Mr. Delmas, but he did not
join in this feeling of derision. He said
tliat the verdicts of JuJges are equally
uncertain, cisc how would there be 114
volumes of the reports of the California
Supreme Court? Quotations were pre
sented from the worKs of Daniel Wcbsier,
Jeremiah 11. Black, Jefferson, Charles B.
.May, Justices Hunt and Muller of the
United States Supreme Court and others,
whoÂ»poke in eulogy of trial by jury.
Mr. Delmas assured the court that in
all ttie arguments here presented there
was not the slightest doubt of his Honor's
impartiality, nor was there any question
of his tidelity to the high trusts devolving
on him. The only contention was that a
jury is the best tribunal for the settle
ment of the question presented here.
Attorney Charles 8. Wheeler, in re
sponse, made a formal motion to dismiss
the panel of jurors in the present case,
and that the court, sitting as a chancellor,
proceed to ifetermine the issues ttiai arise
under the pleadings in equity.
Mr. Delmas said he was entitled to no
tice before any motion to dismiss the
panel could be made. He declined to
waive his legal rights in the case.
Mr. Wheeler said that the attorney for
Deiendant Craven had been guilty of
misconduct on the part of the jurors of
the panel in attendance on the 15th of last
month, In which Mr. Delraas accused the
opponents of his client with shrinking
from a fair trial beforu a jury. In that
memorable address Mr. Deimas went
lurther, and charged tnat Charles L. Fair
and his associates were going before the
Grand Jury behind closed doors, and by
ex parte showings were trying to assassi
nate the zood name of Mrs. Craven. Miss
Craven. Mrs. Haskins and Notary Public
J. J. Cooney. He challenged them to
come out in the light, of day and take
whatever justice with even Hand might
mete out.
After reading freely from Mr. Delmas'
remarks without adding to the effect im
parted at the original delivery Mr.
Wheeler said for tnese things he thought
a jury ought to be dispensed with.
Air. Dslmas said that he dil not admit
that "counsel for Deiendant Craven" had
beer, guilty of any misconduct in the
presence of the jury. In fact, nothing
nad been said that would be feared or
ought to be feared by those who love jus
tice. However, in any event Mr. Wheeler's
motion was not well grounded. If the
court in its discretion saw fit to excuse the
present panel and call a new jury he
would be satisfied. All he wanted was a
jury.
Judge Slack held that tlm was a correct
view of the case and directed Mr. Wheeler
to confine his argument to the question of
whether tnere ought to be a jury at all.
In support of his desire for avoiding a
trial of the matter by jury Mr. Wheeler
argued at considerable length. He agreed
with Mr. iJelrnas in the statement that in
any event the verdict of the jury would
nut be binding on the court and does not
relieve the Chancellor from his duty to
pass on all questions of law and fact. The
only reason for calling in a jury, he said,
is when the questions to be decided are
admitted to ba too complex and too in
volved for the Chancellor to readily pass
judgment on them in all their contradic
tory elements. It is then that a jury is
calied to advise the conscience of the
court. He deprecated the custom of citing
the loose words of courts, however emi
nent, in derogation of what he deemed to
l>e the province of the Chancellor's juris
diction.
Mr. Delmas said that the fear of a jury
trial in this case arises from the dread of
a pos?iMe argument that may be pre
sented. Yet that argument ought not to
be excluded from any tribunal wnen the
rights of men and women are in the bal
ance. He did not understand that â  ver
dict by a jury would be mere wa'-te paper.
True, the Chancellor must approve the
verdict, but it must Le given due weight.
That U the uniform practice.
Chancellor Slack here remarked that it
was his wish to avail him elf ot the assist
ance of a jury to try the i-sues of fact as
to the vuliility of tne disputed deeds. He
realized that the burden in the end rested
on himselt and that he must disregard tee
verdict if :t did not meet with his ap
proval. He would do his duty as he saw
it, no mÃtter whether unpleasant or not.
Mr. Wheeler still contended that the
present panel ought to be dismissed be
cause of Mr. Delmas' speech in the pres
ence of the jurors.
The Chancellor said that without pass
ing on the sufficiency of Mr. Wheeler's
showinsr, the present panel of juror? would
be excused and fcother panel wouid ba
summoned.
Attorney W. M. Pierson informed the
court that in the case of Yon Schmidt
against Yon Schmidt in another court, a list
of forty-eicht prominent business men had
boen prepared by the Chancellor, and that
by agreement the litigants had taken
turns in striking off names until three re
mnined, and betore that jury of three the
case had been tried. He would favoi a
"struck" jury of that character.
Mr. Dimas assured the court that he
and his associates would object to such a
plan. No doubt they might get a jury of
millionaires in the box that wou'd be un
objectionable so far 8s legal technicalities
are concerned, but would any court of jus
tice accept such a jury to try the rights of
citizens where properly and liberty are
involved ?
He thought that would not fill the
measure of the right which trial by jury
guarantees to all. He and hts clients had
been strenuous for a jury trial and they
warn it, if the\v have it at ail, granted in
the usual way. What they demand is
just an ordinary jury, drawn in tiie reeu
lar way. Tne jury box of the City and
County of San Francisco contains 3GOO
names. He knew of no better source for
obtaining a jury than from that jury box.
Judge Slack said he had come to the
conclusion that another panel ought to be
summoned. He said he would consider
the question of how the jurors should be
selected, and would give his decision at
11 o'clock i hie* morning, though his mind
was already pretty well made up as to the
proper courso to be pursued. "
CHINESE COUPLES WEDDED
Interesting Double Ceremony in
Justice Barry's Court
room.
The Two Bride; and Bridegrooms Are
Natives of the Golden
State.
Two native sons were married yester
day afternoon to two native daughters by
a native son.
There is probably nothing unusual in
native tons and daughters being mar
ried by a native no, but in this particular
instance there was something out of the
' ordinary in the fact that the contracting
I parties were of Chinese extraction and first
i saw the light of day in Chinatown. The
â  native son who performed the double
ceremony was Justice of the Pence Bnrry.
The brides were Yuet Oy and Jung Sou,
each 21 years of age, and both exceedingly
i pretty, especially the former. They were
! attired in Chinese costume, but strange to
â  say their trousers were of dark material,
and neither had a bit of color except a
; small piece of blue ribbon fastened to the
j ends of their queue?.
The bridegrooms were Ne Yee, 22 years
of age, and Hor Yock, 23 rears of age.
Both are line specimens of Cninese young
I manhood and are engaged in business in
Chinatown.
Nk Yee and Yuet Oy were the first to
stand up before the Jud^e. Wong Hing,
| a friend of the contracting parties, acted
ias interpreter. Yuet Oy's face beamed
with smiles as the Judge made theni join
j hands, and when she was asked if -hr
j would "love, honor and obey" her hus
| band the smile on her face broadened and
she nodded her head several times. Ng
I Yee never smiled during the ceremony.
j After it was over the Judge shook them
by the hand, out he omitted to exerc se
the usual prerogative of kissing the bride.
After Nfr Yee and Yuet Oy had taken
their seats Hor Yock and Jung Sou stood
| up. Jung Sou had a serious iook on her
face and seernÂ«d as if she was deeDly im
pressed with the solemnity of the occa
sion. She was just as emphatic as Y'uet
Oy in nodding ncr approval of the "love,
honor and obey" par;, and accepted the
congratulations of the Judge with becom
ing gravity.
"Why don't you tell them to kiss each
other?" ?aid the Judge to "Wong Hing,
: who only laucned nnd shook his head.
The newly married couple seemed anx
ious to get aw;i.v and hurried out of the
courtroom, leaving Wong Hing to pet the
certificates.
A STRANGER BUNKOED.
Roland Sheard, Â» Young Englishman,
Relieved of Fifty Golden
Dollars.
Roland Sheard. a young Enelishman,
who recently arrived in the City from
Australia on a visit, made the acquaint
ance of John Russell, better known as
the '-Kid," on Market street Saturday
afternoon.
The "Kid" pave him the usual glad
hand, telling him he was a stranger in the
City, and finally inducing him to rake a
ride to the Cliff Housp. They waited
along the beach, and came across two men
who were amusing themselves playing
the shell game.
"Kid" appeared to get interested, and
began 10 play the game, winning, ot
course. He urged Hheard to try his luck,
but he refused. Tben the "Kid" up
braided him, and accused him of not hav
ine any money. Shcard foolishly pulled
$.v> in gold out or his pocket, and the
"Kid" promptly grabbed it and disap
peared.

and yesterday Defectives Reynolds and
Graham arrested Russell. lie was identi
fied in the City Prison by Stieard, and was

PUNGENT POSTAL
CAUSES TROUBLE
Lawyer Shuck Was Ar
rested for Annoying
Mr. Dement.
Addressed Through the Pstoffice
as a Fellow With Two
Names.
Aggravjtlon of the Offense by Spell
ing Club With Two B's-An
Old Quarrel.
E. D. Dement brought to the Postal In
spector yesterday morning a postal card
addressed as follows:
: This fellow has 2 names and I really :
; don': know how to address him -1
; DEMENT ;
: Care of he fellow or 2 names :
: Han be paid Proas Clubb :
; his hills Sail Francisco :
On the other side was the following:
I say, Dement, you brave lellow, my office is
at 50SJ Kearny 6t
Why don't you call on me. I want to see
you. Dont wait. Oscar T. Shuck
SSJiJ Kearny st
San Francisco April 9 '97.
This is for the fellow who belongs to tho
press clubb.
Dement said that the card was in the
handwriting of Oscar T. ShucK, a well
known lawyer of this City. He claimed,
though Shuck denies the statement,
that two or three years aj;o he and Shuck
were partners in the business of tearching
for owners and heirs of money left un
claimed in City saving- banks. Dement
said that he got tired and with
drew from the partnership about a
year a>ro, and he aaid that he couid not
induce Shuck to settle with him, Shuck
having lost money in disastrous invest
ments in mining property at Kandsbr.rg,
Rprn County.
Dement continned to operate in the
bank cases and Shuck made repeated de
mands for a division of the receipts, on
the ground that Dement was his employe
only and had no right to the money.
Dement charged also that Shuck had
written him several scurrilous and abusive
letters.
Shuck was arrested and brought before
United States Commissioner Heacock on
the charge of sending scurrilous and libel
ous matter through the mails. He was
released on his own recognizance, after
having been ordered to appear this morn
ing.
The penalty for this effense is a fine not
to exceed $5000, or imprisonment at hard
labor not longer than five years, or Dy
both such fine and imprisonment.
OacarT. Shuck was seen regarding the
matter and he said :
"Dement was never my partner, but was
my clerK on commission. He never met
me until the Smith case was all settled,
after years of work by me. He is no law
vei. whereas I have been one here since
1865 and have lived here since 1854, having
devoied twenty years to Drobate law. 1
sent tha postal card, but I dunned no
body. Dement poes by two names â one
as collector, one as 'journalist.' He
omits an initial when he writes himself
down as 'journalist.' He is a quarrelsome
iellow. I clairu that he has treated me
shamefully. He has told people I owe
him money, which is false. He was never
my partner and never wili be. I have had
his power of attorney revoked ia several
cases."
EDITOR MARRIOTT.
The Question of Mis Alleged Libel to
Be Heard To-Day.
In Judge Daingeriield's court yesterday
when the case of .Frederick Marriott,
charged with libel, was called, an applica
tion for delay was made by Attorney
Charles Ben Darwin. He said his client
was not able to be present at that moment,
but would be in court to-day.
S. M. Shortridge of counsel for the de
fense also urced a continuance for a day.
Judge Daingerfield said that Mr. Mar
riott knew the case was to be called for
trial and ought to have been in attendance.
Attorney Julius Kami, specially engaged
to assist in the prosecution, objected to
further postponement of the trial. He
thought tue case had been put over enough
times air ady.
When it was apparent that the court
was disposed to support Mr. Kahn's de
mand for an immediate trial, Mr. Darwin
asked permission to retire from the case,
as he could not salely proceed without the
assistance of his client.
Judge Daingerfield refused to allow him
to withdraw, and ordered that twelve
talesmen should be drawn After they
were seated in the jury-box. Mr. Kahn ex
pressed a willingness to have further pro
ceedings go over until 10 o'clock this
morning, and it \va< so ordered.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 13, 1897.
MINISTER WU
WOULD EDUCATE
He Wants Railroads, Doc
tors and Newspapers in
His Country.
Says the Missionaries and Their
Physicians Have Done Much
Good to the Poor.
Ho Vow, a Distinguished Cantonese
and Brother-in-Law to the Min
ister, May Be Consul Here.
Wu Tinpr Fang, the easy speaking, big
brained and large-bodied Minister from
China to the United States, who debarked
from the Gaelic Sunday with a retinue of
sixty-two people, had a lively day yester
day at the Occidental. Attorneys, on
what mission nobody knows; preachers,
erstwhile teacher* amorce Ting Fang's
countrymen: persons imbued apparently
with mere idle curiosity,' and others of
WU TING FANG, the New Chinese Minister to the United States,
and the Die mend Euttcn and Beauty Rose by Which He
Was Dis tir gushed Yesterday. On the Right Is KO
YGW, Who May Ec San Francisco's Next Consul.
Another Interesting Member of the Party Is the Minister's
Wife, Whose Dainty Foot, as Shewn in Comparison With

different degrees who were simply hang
ers-on, besides newspaper men who were
toere becauÂ»e it was their business,
thronged the corridera of tho hotel yes
terday.
Ttio Minister received his guests in the
parlor, one or two at a time, as the ca-e
might be, the others meantime wailing
just outside in easy reach of call. "\Vu
Ting Fung wears a big button in the round
Muck cap which covers his lirrul. It is be
spangled with diamonds. It must have
cost a fortune, for it is exceedingly oril
liant. On the Jowpt portion of his lefi
shou.der the Oriental diplomat wore a
magniticni American Beauty rose. As it
lay aeainst ihe green background of his
robe it looked very beautiful indeed. Evi
dently the Minister is a man of critical
taste.
The statesman was said to be an intense
advocate of improvements of different
kinds in China. He was reported as hav
ing several lads, among them a desire to
establish maternity hospitals in his coun
try, to foster athletic* and what not.
None of these sublets, however, moved
him when they were mentioned. It
seemed that he bad never thought of
them except in a passing way. However,
â¢he questions served to call forth his opin
ions generally as to what should be done
for China. He spoke directly to the
point, and in a very interesting manner.
"We want newspapers and railroads
and , many other thine*," he said, "to
open the country as I would have it
opened. It I -had. the power I would
build roads throughout the. empire, thus
making communication* easy. The man
in Canton would thus become acquainted
with the man from Peking,:, and get
familiar with bis habits and customs. It
would open, the eyes of both and do them
good. . "A railroad is a great. educator- in
this way. ; Newspapers are very good, too.
There are different wars of getting an edu
cation, and these are some of them. â¢â¢ â¢ '
"I believe in your Western civilization.
I think your missionaries and doctors
â who have established hospitals in differ
ent parts of China have done a great deal
of good. At ? the hospitals they take the
poor people, no matter whether they have
any, money or not, and care for them until
they get well of their ailments. They cer
tainly do a great wore in this way. .
. I hope we shall have more physicians
from the West, and ; that our own people
will study the science of medicine a* it is
The facsimile y^^J^r^^ 'is on every wrapper

taught here and in Europe. But our peo
ple, while they believe that in surgery
you are far ahead of our country, are still
slow to adopt the methods prevalent
here of treating diseases. Li Huns Chang
is a believer in them and when ill takes
your medicines as remedies. Even when
desperately in the people hesitate to
change from their own methods of treat
ment io yours."
The Minister was much interested in
the making of the modern daily news pa
per. He was much suprised that tney
were published con; inuouslyâ without a
rest, regard for holidays or Snndaysâ and
said he dia not see how those who sot out
the papers could stand such arduous toil.
He was also greatly surprised to see young
ladies working on the local staff of the
papers, and inquired if they were em
ployed in other department-, if they did
their work well and what pay they re
ceived.
The big people with the Minister com
prise the following attaches, who are to
be appointed by him to fill various posts
under his dominion as chief autocrat at
Washington :
Wong Ta Chane, who is from Northern
China and who has previously held oflice
in his country.
Chow Chi Yee, also a Northern man
and who has huherto held different oilices
at home.
Low Chin Yee, a Cantonese and man of
large business affairs, who has acquired a
fortune and who is interested in tne house
of Quong Tung Tai at 714 Sacramento
s'.reet.
Sow Ting, a native of Manchn, where
theEmpevor was born. He was an at
tache for a time of the embassy of ex-
Minister Yanp Yu at Washington.
Chung Hoi Koon of Northern China.
Chanc Yunn Tong, a brother of the pre
decessor of Yang Yu at Washington.
This ex-Minister is now a representative
of the P^iupror at the Queen Victoria's
jubilee festival and on hi* way there.
Ho Vow, a Cantonese, brother-in-law to
Minister Wu Tins Fang, and lirother of
Do Ho Kai, niemb^r of the Hongicong
Council. Ho Vow was educated in Eng
land, after whicu he devoted several years
there to the study of law. It is said that
he is the most likely of all the bie me.i
with the Minister to receive the appoint
ment of Consul-General of San Francisco.
He is a fine looking man, ai p.irently not
over 30 y<'ars olu. ' If be s. ion Id be ap
pointed there is reason to believe he would
prove an efficient and popular official.
Among the others of the embassy is
Li Chantr Hsu, nephew of Li Hung Chans
ar.'l son of the former Viceroy of Canton.
The posts to be filled are: Lima, Peru,
one Charge d' Affaires and one Consul;
Havana, one Consul-Genera! ; New York,
one Consul^ Madrid, one Charge d'Af
faires; Pan Francisco, one Consul and one
Consul-Generai.
Banqueted the Minister.
Wu Ting Fang, the new Chinese MlDister,
who is en route to Washington, was tendered
a banquet last nujht by Fung Yung Heng, the
local Consul-General. The feast took pace at
the Yune Fong restaurant on Jackson street,
near Dupont, and was a most formal affair
under the Chinese custom. Only the suites of
the two OrientHl dignitaries we're invited to
attend, making a party ol some *ixty in all.
NOTORIOUS PICKPOCKET.
Nellie Murphy Arrested Twice Within
a Week.
Nellie Murphy, a. notorious pickpocket,
way arrested early yesterday morning on
a charge of grand larceny. George Pium,
an employe in the Lick House, met the
woman in a saloon on Grint avenue and
he says she stole $10 out of his pocket.
Nellie was up before Judge Campbell
last Wednesday on a charge of stealing $4
from a baker. The charge was redured
to petty larceny and s!Â»e"was fined $100
with the alternative of 100 days in the
County Jai!. Thi* time she will' probably
get a term in San Quentin.

ARTHUR SEWALL
IS IN THE CITY
He Does Not Believe Mc-
Kinley's Policy Will
Bring Prosperity.
Says He Hopes It Wil!, That
His Party Will Put Nothing
in the Way.
If Times Do Not Improve Silver Wil:
Be More Than Ev r a Question
His Sou's Candidacy.
Arthur Sewall, recently the candidate
for Vice- President of the United States on
the Democratic ticket, arrived here last
night on the steamer City of Para and is
at the Palace. The distinguished gentle
man lelt his home at Bath, Me., nearly
four weeks ago. He Bailed to Colon,
crossed to Panama, and came by steamer
thence.
Mr. Sewall is a large and what would
be called a fine-looking man. He has a
massive head and an intellectual appear
ance. His hair is thick and dark, with a
faint flecking of gray, while his mustache
is beginning to be silvered. He looks the
substantial ship-builder and banker. But
he is the reverse of austere, being matter
of-fact, unconventional and easily ap
proached. He was asked how he regarded
present conditions of the country and its
prospects.
"Oh, we do not feel like throwing any
thing in the way of Mc&inley," he said,
'"to interfere with his plans. If he can
make a success of them we are satisfied.
We hope he will. Prosperity is certainly
needed. Ido not see anything, however,
that indicates good times, and if they do
not improve through the present admin
istration the li^ut will have to be made
over again in the same way. Under such
circumstances the question of free silver
wii! figure as largely as before.
"I do nat see that the remodeling of the
tariff is going to help much. The Dinsiey
bill, I Delieve, is supposed to increase the
price of wool, and it may help the growers
some, but the mil as a whole will not, in
my judgment, accomplish what it is
claimed it will do for the country.
"No, I don't know much about the
chances of my son, Harold M. bewail, for
the position of United States Minister to
Hawaii. He is an applicant tor the place,
but 1 have received no advice here aboui
it. It cannot he correct that he was due
here a weeek aco to sail for Hawaii, as
has been reported.' 7
HABEAS CORPUS FOR ALICE.
Famoaa Claimant in the Blythe Cuso
Restrained of ller Liberty.
Alice Edith Dickason-Blythe, one 6f the
claimants to the Biytlie estate, went to a
home for inebriates a week ago.
J. W. iJrahnstad averred yesterday that
when she tried to get out the proprietors
of the place reused to let her go, alleging
tbat Mr. Varney, her guardian, wished to
have her restrained.
After hearing the statement made by
Attorney Charles G. NÂ«i;le and reading
tue nllidavits in the case Judye Seawcii
granted a writ of habeas corpus returna
ble before Judge Dunne of the Supeiior
Court at 10 o'clock tins morning.
Dropped Dead.
Adolph Schulteoi 174 Jessie street, who had
Deen for some time porter in a saloon on Third
meet, was oa his way yesterday at noon to
the City mid County Hospital to become an
Inmate. He was accompanied by a friend
named Martin, ana when he arrived in front
of me gate dropped de.-.d, presumably from
heart disease. The deceased was a native 01
Germany, aged 42 years. \
FOOD COFFEE.
PROPER FOOD,
And Not Drugs â The Common-Sense
Way.
.The failure of ninety-nine men (and
women) to do what they want, make
money, earn a home or fortune, make a
name for themselves, or attain whatever
goal they aim at, is due to impropei living.
Unnatural food and drink gradually un-
dermine the stomach and the nervous sys-
tem, and somewhere in the body the trou-
ble shows, which drugs will not heal. It
may be dyspepsia, constipation, heart
trouble, kidney complaint or lung trouble,
or ii may show in bad blood, tumors, piles,
weak eyes, loss of hearing and head trou-
bles, all these and many more are caused
by stomach andi nervous disorder, and
they cannot exist when stomach and
nerves work properly. ' .
Lei us seek by natural livine to be well
and happy. Abuses of the body cannot
be helped by medicines unless the abuses
stop, and if that is done the person will
get well quicker without drugs, in nine
cases out of ten.
One of the greatest causes of disease of
â  the present day is found in some things i
litil suspected. ' ' .
Coffee is one- of these "polished Til- '
la ins." .
People wonder day ; after day "what in
the world makes me leel so," knowing that
the ill feelings slowly add up, until a sure
day of reckoning comes in the shape of a
spell of sickness, expensive to pocket and
always a considerable pushdown the hill
in more ways than- one. Yet they don't
seem to find where the trouble lie* until
they quit coffee and tea and go onto a
plain diet.
Thousands are learning these. facts, and
it was to help such as find it about impos-
sible to get on without coffee that careful
experimenters worked nearly a twelve-
month to produce Postum Cereal, a bever-
age with tlie color, pungency and piquant
flavor of coffee, but composed of the pure
grains of the field (wheat; etc.). it can be
used freely by adults and children, as it is
simply the juices of the cereals and is a
perfect food-drink, while in taste and ap-
pearance it is coffee. .
It is, scientifically prepared by the
Postum Cereal Co., Llm., of Battle
Creek, Mich., and is not as strong and
acrid as very strong and low-grade coffee,
but ranks in flavor and color with the tine
mellow grades 01 the high-priced .Mocha
and Java and creams to the clear golden
brown so greatly liked by connoisseurs.
A few days' use makes one very fond of
the delicious, nourishing cup 01. Pustum,
and the old ill-feelings of ; body gradually
disappear. Why? it is . asked. Your
chemist will tell yon that it is now clearly
shown. by analysis that the same poison-
ous alkaloids exist in coffee Â«s in mor-
phine,; whiaKy, tobacco and strychnine,
and the daily doses directly attack stom-
ach, heart, hver and nerves. These facts
make plain the reason for so many serious
attacks on the body from a hitherto un-
suspected quarter. It's the knife in the
dark that kills, but science has thrown
lieht :on this subject, and ; . one can 1 " now
have the satisfaction at least . of knowing
what it is that hurts. .
There is but one genuine original Posturn
Cereal coffee, with a , multitude : of imita-
tions offered as "just as good." .;

CERTAINTY
So Says President Thorn
ton, and He Should
Know.
THE RIGHT OF WAY
ABOUT SECURED.
Ground Will Doubtless Be
Broken Within a Few
Months.
WORK FOR HUNDREDS OF THE
UNEMPLOYED.
Tne New Line Will Tap a Rich S?c
tiOD That Has Heretofore
B;en Ignored.
The incorporators of the West Shore
Railway â the line that i? intended to skirt
the shores of the Pacific Ocean all the way
from San Francisco to Santa Cruz and
thu6 tap a strip of most productive coun
try which has heretofore been completely
ignoredâ have not been courting a great
deal of publicity of late, but nevertheless
have been quite as active as ever.
As a matter of fÂ£Ct, according to Presi
dent Thornton, this proposed line is at
present nearer a reality than it has been
at any time since the project was first
mooted. If ground be not broken and
actual work be not commenced within a
comparatively few months the promotors
will be disappointed, and this is some
thing that they do not anticipate. Indeed
President Thornton says he is satisfied
that before the clo3e of this year hundreds
of men wnoare serionsly in need of em
ployment will be at work on the line and
it will be work that will last many months
and furnish relief foi numerous needy
families.
"All that prevents us from starting right
now 13 the fact that we have not quite se
cured all of our rights of way," said Mr.
Thornton yesterday. "We "have really
oeen taking our time about this matter,
or rather we have been proceeding cau
tiously, because we do not wisn to make
any blunders. 1% is our intention to posi
tively and finally secure every right of
way Before we turn a spadeful of earth.
We want no litigation. Condemnation
suits, I know, are the usual things, but we
propose to have none of them.
"We got a pointer on this proposition
from our dear friend and sympathizer,
> .".us Spreckels. He gave us some advice
recently, telling us not to make amove
until we had finished np everything in reÂ«
pard to the securing of rights of way. It
was rather an unusual method in railroad
building, he confessed, but he thouehi it
would prove itself to be the beat. At all
events we have decided to be guided by
his suggestions.
"As matters stand at present we have
succeeded in getting a route through tbe
most disputed lands, and tbe rest of it ap
pears on tbe face to be easy of accom
plishment. I mean by that the land
owners with whom we have yet to deal
are quite friendly toward us and will do
the right thing. Everybody along the
projected route seems to realize that the
road, when nnished and in operation, will
be a big thing for them, and they p.rc im
patient for the actual beginning of work.
We are not handicapped by any lack of
capital, so, you see, there is really nothing
to prevent us from getting down to busi
ness at an early date."
The West Shore Railway Company ob
tained its initial start when it purchased,
two years ago, all the rights of wav of the
Kan Francisco and West Shore Railway
Company, consisting of valuable fran
chises secured from the City of San Fran
cisco, giving the company the right to
U3e certain strcetr- in traversing tbe City
to a point on the b ly shore near Twenty
rifth strset and Potrero avenue, a distance
of eighteen minutes by streetcars to Third
and Market streets.
The company expects to build a line
t!iat will furnish the traveling public a
quicker trip from this City to Santa Cruz
man either of the Southern Pacific's lines
ran afford and over one of the most pic
turesque routes in tbe world. It confi
dently expects that by running a road
south along tbe shore of Halfmoon Bay
ana thence on down to Santa Cruz it will
expose vast natural weaitu and develop
an enormous traiiic.
Leon Coborn. a wealthy landholder of
Santa Cruz County, has given the new
road a fine depot site at ;bat po.nt on mo
r Â»ast where Peseadero Creek empties into
the ocean â a splendid location for a thriv
ing little townâ and it is understood tbat
he will al-to give two miles rignt of way
through his land. Coborn's business
senst! prompted this.
The projectors have found, as the result
ol their surveys, that they will be com
relied to desert the shore for a few miles,
at the point in banta Cruz County where
Wndell Creek reaches the ocean. The
coast here ;s far too rocky to permit the
laying of tracks around it economically.
In consequence the road will now swing
inland from this point and will continue
downward through several pretty iitiie
valleys until it reaches San Vicente Creek,
where it will azain dart out for the beach.
This bend will practically constitute tho
only part of the road from which the
mighty Pacific will not be in constant
view.
THAT FOOTBALL MONEY.
The Pacific Association Ordered It to
Be Given to the Balboa iluule
vard Kami.
The board of governors of the Pacific
Amateur Athletic Association has decided
to turn over the funds accruing from the
football gams which took, place last win
ter in this City between the Olympic and
Butte City football teams to the Baibda
boulevard fund, amounting to $700.
It will be remembered that after and be
fore the football game considerable dis
cussion arose over the personnel of the
Butte City team, which the captain
finally acknowledged was composed of
amateur and professional players.
The game, however, was allowed to take
place under protest, and the moneys
taken in at the gate instead of being
divided among the teams to defray their
expenses, etc., were held under the thumb
m the association, to be disposed accord
ingly as the Parinc Atnletic Association
I'overnors saw fitâ that is. after the ex
renses of the Olympic Club proper bad
been deducted.
The association is etill hot after the
amateurs who have contested for money
prizes and some of them, including Stuart,
Carter and Frank Gilbert, have been ad
judged full-fledged professionals, who can
not pcrticipate In future in contests gov
erned by the rules o! the Amateur

These sii little desperadoes committed tha heinous offense of entering a hole in the wall just laree enough for their pas
sage and helping themselves to the candy in Louis Grade's shop at sÂ°Â»B Washington street. Frank Burdeste, who was cap

lance, are Manuel Ross, aged S years; Moses Rothenstein, 10; Harry Rothenstein, 8; Harry Lee, 8, and Harry Ross, 8. The
little fellows held hi^h carnival yesterday in the matron's room at the City Prison, where they were detained awaiting their
deportation to the Boys' and Girls' Aid Society, or back to their homes, providing their respective mothers promised to give
them a liberal allowance of swift slipper-oil. Tne latter course was pursued late yesterday afternoon.

In regard to the forthcoming contest
between Thompson and Agnew.it may be
said Thompson, the colored champion of
Bait Lakeâthat is of the cJass of hirhleis
he represents âis of comparatively un
known quality, but be has an excellent
record nevertheless, and men who are
3ood judges of boxing do not hesitate to
say that he will give Agnew a hard race
ior the long end of the purse.
Anyhow Thompson looks every inch a
fichter and ii has been said in undertones
that Agnew has a wholesome regard for
the colored lad's ri;ht-hand punches,
which are said to be something terrible.
Thompson claims that he whipped Agnew
in Belt Lake City, but tbe white man says
no. and that the li^ht ended in a draw.
The Stelzner and Greggains contest will
be twenty rounds ami the Agnew and
Tbompsou scrap fifteen round;. The club
will doubtless match Kennedy of the San
Francisco Club to box eieht rounds aeainst
soaie of the local scrappers, an 1 this will
be the curtain-raiser. Tne Pacifies have a
good card, which the sporting public will
acknowledge.
The next fight which will be held
under the auspices of the National
Cub will take place on the evening
of the 2.'sd inst. The programme
reads: Bob Armstrong, who is a c >unter
nart of Peter Jackson, and who is now
under tho management of 'â¢Parson"
Davies, will meet bam Pruit in a fifteen
round bout. Both men ure colored heavy
weights nnd said to be very hard punchers.
Jimmy Barry and Jimmy Anthony will
box twenty rounas to cecide the bantam
weight championship of the world, and it
is certain that Jim will w;n the fistic race
and the honors connected therewith. A
third match will be arranged this coming
.The Olympic Club is still looking for
talent, and perhaps it may match La
vigne and Gans, the â  bard-bming 133
--pound champion pugilist of Baltimore,
for twenty rounds- Gans would give La-,
vitÂ»ne a hard run to the finish, bat bis
manager is looking for soft snaps before
Gans is turned loose upon the cracker
jacks.
The club is also thinking of matching;
George Green and Tommy West, the
colored fighter who whipped Walcott re
cently in the East. Green cannot very
well draw thÂ» line on West, as he (Green)
consented to tight Walcott in Carson, but
the latter refused the offer to meet the
CtUiforman. Green now seems to be a
terror to all men in his class. George is
at present rusticating in Glen Eiien and
is taking good care of himself.

OLYMPIC BIKERS
STILL DEFIANT
A Special Relay Race
With the Bay Citys
Seems Certain.
The Matter Will Be Settled at
a Meeting to Be H?ld
To-Night
Th'.-r: Seems to Be a Division of
Sentim nt as to the Rues
That Should G:vern.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen will hold
â  special meeting 'this eveuing for the pur
pose oi considering the proposition to en
gage in a private 100-miie relay race with ;
the Bay City Wheelmen, so as to settle
the much-mooted question of supremacy
between those rival organizations.
It is all the outcome of the recent an
nual century relay, in which the Bay City i
contingent came out with top honors and
j the Olympics in second place. There was
â  a row and a protest over the decision.
The protest emanated from the Olympic
Club riders, who claimed that certain
members of the victorious team did not
make any pretense toward living up to the
rules governing the race.
After accusing the Bay City contingent j
of resorting to trickery and unfairness in
order lo win the Olympics dared the vfc- i
tors to pedal over the course once more .
againÂ«t their men. Through Captain Day
the Bay City riders accepted this cnal
lenge, and now all that seems to remain Is
for the Olympic lads to announce when
they will be ready.
"We propose to give everybody fair
warning in this affair that we will pace
our riders over the course," said one of the j
forenios' Olympians last nighi. "This is '
in violation of the ruies, we know, but mm I
are so certain that the Bay City racers will
not live up to the rules that we do not
propose to take any chances. They have :
resorted to their little tricks every time I
they raced before, and it stands to reason :
that they will do it again. Therefore, we
say, let's have no rules to violate.
"They might just as v.-ell come out and
agree to the pacing of all the riders, for
they woulrt do it themselves anyhow. We j
do not intend to be caught napping j
again."
But then, this is only one Olympic opin
ion. It can be truthfully said that such
radical ideas are not entertained by all of
tiie members. A ereat many of them 'â 
favor looking at the matier coolly and j
sensibly, and of keeping one idea before !
them throughoutâ the good of the iport. I
Not that they are Inclined to abandon j
the special-race propositionâ they seem
on;y too eager for thatâ but rather diÂ«
courace the idea of opening the way for
another dispute by deliDerntely violating
the amateur ruies. These conservative
memberssay: "Let the t<vo ciubs have
an understanding beforehand that the
race will be strictly under the rules, and
that the one which commits an infraction
will be declared tbe loser. '
This element of tbe Olympics seems
confidant that its team can beat the Bay
City riders over the 100-mile triangle, and j
professes that it wants to see it done "on
tbs square."
But all this is to be a matter for dis
cussion at to-night'.H meeting. One thing
seem* certain, and chat is that the Olym
pics will stand by their original challenge
for a special race over the big relay course, i

There have been a number of changes
on the Oregon Navigation and Improve

Prebble has retired and Third Officer Wait
has been appointed to his place. It. Bakey
has taken Watt's place, and the second
officer will remain in his present position.
The reason for Watt's jump is the fact that
he holds a master's certtlicate, while the
second mate does not. Captain Prebble
will take command of one of the boats
leaving for Alaska and will be gone several
montns.
The following cannery boats are all fit
ting out : The ship Sterling, Willie B.
Hume, Eclipse and Merom. All of them
are bound for Nuchigak and among them
will take away about 1000 Chinese and 250
sailors and fishermen. Ti>e Sterling is the

is one of the best-liked men in the service.

A. E. Pryor, seneral manager of Piper-
Aden-<Toouall Company, ttt* diver and
the men who were working on the wreck
of the Sunol iast Saturday nlfrfat got a
j^are that sent them ashore in a hurry.
When the steamer was cut down the
music-box was playing "The Wearing
of the Gret-n," in honor of St. Patrick's
day. It was a beautiful night and Pryor
was sitting on ih â  rail wailing lor the
diver to come up, when he was astounded
to bear under the schooner's quarter the
strains of "Home, Sweet Home." The
sound came n arer and nearer, and soon
the diver appeared, carrying ihe music-
Lox under his arm. A sudden jar had set
the musical instrument going, out it only
played a few minutes and ttien coiJap'-ed.
Pryor took the hint, however, and calling
up t:.e tug took all the wreckers, divers
and deckhands usho.e and scut them to
the Tivoli. As superintendent of the
newiy discovered silver mine at the bot
tow oi the bay Pryor is a great success, and
he says that if me bullion taken out every
day was only bis own he would retire
from business in-ide of a month.
The Oceauic Steamship Company's Mon
owai went to Mission Rock yesterday to
discharge her cargo of siuar. There are
so many vessels wailing an opportunity to
discharge at the refinery that room cou;d
not be made for the steamer, so her cargo
was put out oa the rock.
The Alaska Steamship Company, with
headquarters at i'uget Sound, cannot find
a boat to take the place of the Willapa,
which went ashore and became a total loss
some weeks ago. For over c week tney
have been trying to purchase the new
steamer Humboidt, which is now running
on the Eureka route, but have signaily
iÃiled. Max Kalish, agent for the Hum
boidt S:eamship Company, says the vessel
will remain on tlie route as long as there
is anytlune sor lior to do. It is no wonder
the .Alaska people wanted to secure the
Humboidt, as'she is one of the hand
somest, bent appointed and smartest boats
that makes San Fianci-co her home port.

chandler, groceryman and others. They
have since been making a vain attempt to
collect the mo:iey from the agent, but
more drastic measures have now been
taken. As soon as the steamer reaches
Seattle from Portland she will be liable
for about $1500 and some settlement will
have to be maue before the steamer wil 1

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top flguiÂ«Â«
ft station indicate maximum temperature for the
days- those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in Inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid}
line*, connect po'n s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines,' equal temperature. The
word "hleh" means hlÂ«h tarometric pressure and
Is usually accomoanied by fair weather: "low '
refers to* low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rams.
"Lows" us .ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When be pressure Is high In the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south alone the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low'- Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is prob
able. With a "high" In the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weÂ»ther may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

nounced feature of the stock market was absence
of any demand for stock, except from professional

of prices was downward. The only stock in
which trading exceeded 10,000 shares was Chi

Olney as a Pedestrian.
Secretary Olney takes a long walk every
day and always moves at a rate that con
stantly threatens to turn into a run,
though it never does so except occasion
ally, when he darts in front of a rapidly
moving streetcar. These walks begin
about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, when the
Secretary emerges from the State Depart
ment building, parsing up Executive to
Pennsylvania avenue and then, turning
to the right, starts for the Peace Monu
ment, at the foot of Capitol Hill. He is
invariably dressed for these excursions in
a short boxcoat with trousers to match
and a derby hat. Now and then, but
rarely, he wears a light fall overcoat; usu
ally he prefers to trust for warmth to the
energy of his motion. The Secretary
often invites a friend to accompany him
on these trips, but he rarely gets an ac
ceptance twice from the same man, for
the tastes of department otheials and dip
lomats do not usually lie in the direction
of violent exercise.â New York Times.
The Russians have a simple device
which is said to be very effective in check
ing runaway horses. A thin cord with a
running noose around the neck of the
horse is used, and when the animal bolts
the cord is pulled. Tne horse stocs as
soon as it feels the pressure on the wind-

IN ALAMEDA
The Saloons Seem to Be
Ahead in Eight Pre
cincts.
St. Sure Ahead ior Recorder and
Taylor for Attor
ney.
The Vote Was Very L :h', a Little
Over Half That of Two
Years Ago-
ALAMEDA, L'al., April 12.â 1t had been
hoped that the municipal campaign which
came to an end to-day would be con
ducted in a fair, decent and above-board
manner. This had been the case down to
within forty-eight hours, but at the last
moment certain parties took it upon them
eelvÂ«s to issue circulars which had the
effect of harming the issuers and benefit
ing those against whom they were directed.
On behalf of the saloonmen an anony
mous circular was issued, which even the
printer was ashamed of and had not the
race to attach his name to as required by
iaw, though bis identity is well known.
The writer's identity is also pretty well
understood.
This circular made a most intemperate
attack upon the anti-saloon people of Ala
me<!a and church people in general, and
dealt solely in abuse of the worst kind.
The other circular referred to had a name
attached to it and was devoted to a vilely
libelous attack on R. B. Tappan, candidate
for City Attorney. It was not issued at
the instigation of his opponent, Mr. Tay
lor, however, who earnestly disclaims any
responsibility. Nevertheless it aided Tap
pan instead of injuring him.
The contemptible characterof the attack
is emphasized by the fact that Tappan is
sick abed and unable to take any part In
the campaign or to defend himself in any
way from such assault?.
Outside of these effusions, however, the
campaign has been mild and the election
passed off quietly.
Unofficial returns of the contest are as
follow*:
City Trusteesâ Brick 1440. Bchulte 1081.
Smith 387, White 852.

Tnis gives a majority for (he saloons in
eight precincts, against in four ana a tie
in one. Tnere is nothing binding about
this vote, it being merely an expression of
opinion on the matter. The total vote
â was very light, being only about 1600, as
compared with 2260 two years ago.

PILTHY CHINESE.
The Board of Health Determined to
Stop Certain Practices.
OAKLAND, Cau. April 12.â The Oak
land Board of Health has made what it
claims to be a remarkable discovery in
connection with the filthy habits of Chi
nese. There are place* in this city where
Chinese bakers and Chinese cooks si. ray
he bread before putting it in the oven from
their mouths in the earns manner as they
epray clothes.
The board is now engaged in drawing up
an ordinance which shall cover as far as
practicable the regulation of all places
where Chinese are employed other than in
private residences. There is already an
ordinance in effect prohibiting Chinese
from spraying clothes from their mouths,
but it has been found almost impossible
to enforce it unie-s an inspector be posted
permanently in each laundry and this of
course is out of the question.
The matter has been made very promi
nent because of a sensational report by
Dr. Barah Shuey, a member of the board,
in which she has traced a most malignant
form of disease of one of her patients di
rectly to the germs fathered by clothes
that were Â«ent to a Chinese waihhouse.
Health Officer Bradley is now engaged
in inspecting Chinese places and in out

LIQUOR AT FRUITVALE.
An Attempt Being Made to Obtain
License* for Saloons.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 12.â Very earn
eit efforts are being made by prospective
saloon-keepers to break through tne pro
hibition barrier that has-been erected
around the Thirty-third-avenue district.
For several years this district has re
fused to permit saloons within its bound
aries, and as a result petitions and protests
have bsen numerous before the City Coun
cil. It is very evident that the saloon
keepers think that they will nave some
influence with the present Council, as to
day four applications for licences were filed
with the City CJerk and more are being
prepared for presentation.
They will be bitterly fought by the resi
i dents. One of the applicants, named
> Budd, is already a defendant in a pending
i case charging him with having sold liquor
\ without a license.

A WOMAN'S TONGUE.
Her Husband In Not Responsible for I
Its Wag Ring.
OAKLAND, Cal., April , 12. â Judge
Greene decided to-day that a husband is
not liable for Blander when his wife is the
defendant. The case was that of J. M.
Douglass against J. H. McKenzie and wif
for $10,000. Judgment was given for $300
against the wife personally.
The court held that the old doctrine if
the liability of the husband for the wron*
ful acts of the wife grew up under a con
dltion of things where the wife and the
husband were in a legal sense one person
and that person the husband. He could
then control the propariy and income of
the wife, but with the more liberal policy
of recent laws, which recognize the rights
of the wife to her interest in the commu
nity property and to hold her separate es- |
tate, the reason for the old policy has I
passed. The court?, particularly in Kan- j
sas ana Illinois cases, have held that the |
husband is exempt from liability for dam- |
ages done by the wife in the matter of
slander.
Judge Greene's decision is the first of its
nature delivered in California.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 13, 1897.
THE McCULLOUGHS

Mesmerism Said to Have
Been Used by the Well-
Known Doctor.
He Denies All Guilt and Re'ers
to H.s Wi.e's Written
Confession
Both Sides Freely Talk of Sensations
That Wi 1 Develop Daring the
Progress of the Tria'.
Oakland OrncE San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 12. )
The suit of Mrs. May C. McCullough
against her Husband, Dr. Frank E. McCul
lougb, lor a diTorce, was called in the Su
perior Court this morning.
Since the bringing of tbe suit Mrs. Me-
Cullougn has made a remarkable state-
MRS. MARY McCULLOUGH, Who Wants a Divorce, and DR.
McCULLOUGH, Whom She Charges With Being a Mesmerist.
ment â which, if it bo true, proves that her
husband is a very powerful mesmerist.
The complaint shows that Dr. McCul
lounli does not findjthe love of one woman
sufficient fur his comprehensive nature,
and Mrs. McCullouph has draÂ»g?d into
her allegation^ many family skeletons
that have been bidden for more than a
year.
The plaintiff is several years youngi-r
than her husband and is of a haughty
disposition, anJ this trait in her character
is clearly eviaenced when she tells her
story.
"We were married," she ?aid, "Â»n De
cember 2, 1893, aud for some months
everything went well, and one day I was
j surprised to hear my husbnnd say that
there was a woman in the world that he
j loved more than myself. Very often the
{ doctor would show me, whnn'a Jittle com
j pany would be present, how completely
j he could put a person under his power.
'. It was no joke, for h? is an accomplished
! mesmerist, and i.c has often tried his
! power on me. He now say* i hat he holds
j a written confession from nic in whicu I
I admit (hat 1 myself had been polity of
I wrongdoing. Whenever he trie I to influ
ence me I always fought him off, but if he
ever did succeed he probably made me
write the confession he now holds. He
used to do strange things and try to put
me in a trance, bul I always protested
vigorously.
"If he produces any alleged confession
from me I will charge him with being a
mesmerist who U9es the power vested in
him for criminal purpoies and I can prove
my case. Several of us once saw him hyp
notize a woman jutt to amuse us and then
get her to sign a receipt for $1000 after
navmg given her but one 5-cent piece.
"Dr. McCuilough would discuss with
me to my utter astonishment the woman
whom be said he loved more than me, but
at no time would ne mention her in the
presence of another person. He left me
alone at times and the absence of cruelty
was made up by bis pronounced indiffef
nce and neelect. One nipht I did take a
etroll ont and went to the Masonic Hall
swbere the doctor said he was going to at
tend a dance. I saw his phaeton iiitched
near the entrance and I got into it and
sat down. About midnight the doctor
came out with the woman whom he bad
gone crazy over. They started to get into
the bugiry but discovered me and fled. I
aÂ«ked Dr. WilKes to drive me home and
he did so. That i* all my husband has to
say against me, that a friend was kind
enough to manage the horse for me and
get me home safely."
Dr. McCuilough says that while living
on liust Sixteenth street lots of thing*
happened which he would prefer bad been
kept secret, but now be ntust make them
public to defend himself.
"Her charges are devoid of truth," said
he, "and spite caused ncr to bring these
proceedings. Since separating seven
mouths ago she has called on me several
times, but I tefused to see her, and she has
now brought in the name of a lady whom
I scarcely know and whom I have Dot
seen for over a year. 1 shall fight this
case every inch of the way, aud before we
â re through Mrs. McCullongh will be
sorry that she started it"
All parties concerned were not ready to
day to pre enl their testimony and the
trial of the case was continued till next
week.
CRUSHED UNDER A TREE.
Fearful End of George Sims, a Forester
of Danville.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 12.â George
Sims, a treecutter of Danville, was in
stantly killed by the sudden falling of a
large oak on which he had been working.
S.ms has been engaged in the business of
cutting trees in Contra Costa and Ala
meda counties for many years.
The unfortunate man leaves a widow
and two children, who were entirely de
pendent oti his earnings and who are now
living at Danville.
An examination of the tree which
caved tbe fatal accident shows that the
oak feil at an angle largely different from
that on wh'ch the woodcutter hÂ»d calcu
lated, and had it fallen where he intended
he would not have been struck. There is
no doubt that a sudden eusi of wind for
which he could not possibly have made
any provision was responsible for his
death.
Fire Department Changes.
OAKLAND. Cal., April 12.â The Fire
Coinomfcioners will meet on Wednesday,
and it is believed that a change in the
head of the department will be made at
that time. Fred A. Campbell is making a
strong right for the placs, and it is be
lieved has the necessary two votes. Com
missioner Dow is opposed to the removal
of Fair.
McNally Road Cleared.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 12. â Rev.
Father McNally, who was mainly instru
mental in having opened up some time
ago the beautiful McNally road, appeared
before the Supervisors this morning, and
informed the board that some one had
erected a fence across tlie highway. The
matter was referred to the Road Commis
sioner of the district, with instructions to
have the highway cleared at once.
A JAPANESE TRAVELER.
K. Noro on Ills Wtty Home From a
Tour of the Lending Cities of
tbe World
K. Noro, vice-president and managing
director Naigwai IJuÂ«;an Trading Com
pany, Kobe, Japan, arrived in the City

Boston, Chicago, Washington and many
other cities. He will journey hence to
morrow by rail to catch the steamer sail
inr from Vancouver to Japan.
Mr. Noro is deeply concerned about the
taiifl legislation pending in Washington
and fears that a prohibitory dnty may be
placed on Feverul articles manufactured
in Japan, and e>pecially that of matting.
He speaks of the activity of Japan in
the manufacture of cotton and woolen
goods ami siys a large quantity of Ameri
can cotton is imported by Japan. He
says the trade between Japan and San
Francisco should be very large, and that
his country would be a large purchaser
of machinery ma 1 â¢ in San Francisco if
transportation charges could be main
tained at a reasonable figure.
Two distinguished residents of Japan
will arrive in Ban Francisco on the next
steamer from the Orientâ one is the presi
dent of the Nippon Bank and the other is
M. Sumitomo, the owner of a celebrated
copper mine and the richest man in Japan.
The yield of the copper mine is 6,000,000

BITTEN BY A MONKEY.
Charles Kmpey Has a Double Doit
of Bad Luck at the
Chuten.
Charles Ernpey has filed two damage
snite- for $10,000 each against the Paul
Boynton Chutes Compnny.
Mr. Empey, through his attorney, Wil
liam M. Abbott, alleges that on the 28th
of April, 1896. while employed on the
e.iute grounds, the servants of the de
fendant company allowed a hsavy stick of
timber to fail on him. injuring him to the
extent of $10,OCO. The second complaint
is oi a mure serions nature, for in that
Mr. Empey alleges that on the 11th of last
January the Chutes Company kept and
owned a vicious and ferocious monkey,
which was accustomed to bite mankind;
that on the date last mentioned, at the
Chutes grounds, the aforesaid monkey
did jump on, attack, bite and greatly
wound the plaintiff about the neck and
head, and particularly the cords of said
plaintiff's neck, in consequence of which
he became sick and sore and the cords of
his said neck nave become stiff; that the
injuries aro permanent, and that he ought
to have $10,000 in compensation for his
suffering?.
In consequence of his hard luck and bis
Inability to pay the fees in advance Judge
Seawell has issued an order permitting
the tiling of the complaint and requiring
the county to wait until the plaintiff wins
before collecting the same.

Tennis Player* Disagree.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 12.â Magee
and M' in, the two representatives of the
State University in the annual tennis
tournament with Staniord, nave a griev
ance against the Palo Alto boys on ac
count of the refusal of the latter to piny
off the match before the first or second
week in May. Alaeee says that it has al
ways been the custom to play off the
games during the early part of April, be
fore the spring ''exes" at Berkeley begin,
: but on account of the desire of Stanford to
enter Freeman in both the tennis tourney
and the baseball games they have refused
to play until after the last baseball match,
which occurs on May 4.
The University of California "exes"
begin on April 26, while those at Stanford
do not commence until the latter part o!
May. The date upon which Stanford
wishes to play will fali in the very midst
of the Berkeley ''exes," and on this ac
count Magee says he and Mem have a
vigorous complaint coming.

JOOST HAS
ABANDONED
HIS CLAIMS
Will Make No Effort to
Redeem the San Mateo
Road.
FUTURE PLANS OF THE
OWNERS.
Tbe Entire Line to Be Relaid
With Eighty Four- Pound
Rails.
NEW ROLLING STOCK ALSO TO
BE ADDED.
Several Feeders to Be Constructed ss
Soon as Franchises Can B;
Secured.
Bebrend Joost has abandoned all his
alleged rights to redeem the San Mateo
Railway and that property is now abso
lutely and completely owned by A. B.
JSpr.ckels, J. D. Soreckels, J. A. Buck, N.
Ohlandt and others, who purchased it for
$300,000 a year ago at a sale made by tne
receiver of the then insolvent corporation.
Since then the company was reorgan
ized under the title of tne San Mateo
Electric Hallway Company, with officers
as follows: President, A. B. Sprectels;
vice-president. J. A. Buck; treasurer,
Walter Gibson; secretary, W. Clayton,
and with J. D. Spreckels as the riftii
director.
Owing to apprehended legal entangle
ments ibe road was simply operated as
best it couid be in the condition in which
it was when the transfer was made, though
it was realized that v.ere was ample room
for improvement. Tlie line runs irnm the
corner of Steuart and Market streets via
Harrison, Fourteenth, Guerrero, Chenery
and various other minor streets and
the County road, beyond the County road
into San Mateo County, and on to Holy
Cross Cemetery. Its entire length is
about thirteen miles.
The new owners yesterday announced
that they would at once begin Hie work of
improvins and extending tne line, and be
tween $200,000 and $;>OO.OOO will be ex
pended on the enterprise to bring it up to
its bigne*t state of efficiency, both for the
benefit of the public and tne stockholders.
Evry foot of tract is to be replaced
wi'h sleel rails, and the rolling
stock will be improved by the addition of
a number of new cars and the complete
renovation of all t^e cars now ;u service.
When all the contemplated improve
ment? have been made the service will be
more frequent, more rapid and more com
fortable, and will offer every inducement
to those living along tlie route to patronize
the remodeled line.
But the most important step that will
be taken by the present owners will be
the construction of a number of feeders to
the main line in various portions of this
County and also beyond the County line.
While it is unqualifiedly stated that this
plan is to be carried out, the details, in
cluding even the preliminary steps for
the feeders, have not yet been dec ded
upon. The first work will be to secure
the franchise's for the proposed branch
Jines, and where the extensions are to be
built will depend largely upon where
franchises and rights of way can be most
readily and favorably obtained.
There is to be a meeting of the directors
of the road to-morrow, Â»t which many of
the proposed improvements and exten
sions will be discussed and decided upon
in detaii.
PURE-FOOD CRUSADE.
I. on in Hartter, Wholesale Grocer, Fined
for Selling Adulterated Kant
em Jellies. ; , .
Louis Hartter of the firm of Hartter,
Hayes &. Co., wholesale grocers, 216 Front
street, who was convicted by a jury in
Judge Campbell's court Friday of selling
adulterated Eastern jellies, appeared for
sentence yesterday.
The Judge said that as it was the first
offense ne would not inflict the full pen
alty, bat if the defendant appeared biiore
him again and was convicted he would
not be so lenient. He imposed a tine of
$60.
Attorney Reddy, for the defendant, ap
plied for a writ of habeas corpus before
Judge S=wall, with the view of -esiing the
constitutionality of the adulterated -food
act, and the defendant was released on
$500 bonds.
Hartter, previous to the trial of his case,
filed an affidavit for a change of venue,
alleging that he could not get a fair and
impartial trial owing to the bias and
prejudice of the Judee, who, he alleged,
had attended a meeting of the Board of
Health and had stated there that he would
convict in ail cases.
The Judge characterized tbe allegations
as false and hinted that Hart'er might
have to answer a charge of perjury. He
refused to transfer the case, as it had
been held there could be no change of
venue in the Police Court-.

Irish Leader for the

Rather Than the Claims

prounJ tor a Time B cause of an
Unfavorab c M jority.
Michael Davitt, member of Parliament
from Ireland, arrived in Oakland last
Sunday evening with his wife and cnil
dren on a visit to his wife's aunt, Mrs.
CanniDg, at 954 Sixteenth street.
The party left Londoa two weeks ago
Jast Saturday. For nine years up to a
year ego they h>id neen living at Bally
brack, County Dublin, a locality rich in
scenic beauties.
For the past year they had been living
in London. Mr. Dan: t was obliged to
give up his : ome in Ireland owing to his
having been elected to Parliament two
years ago. and I, is duties as a member of
mat body requiring him to live in Lon
dan. They have come to California to
gain health in the warm airs that come in
through lint Golden Gate.
Mrs. Divitt and the children will re
main in Oakland for a year or two, while
Mr. Daviti wiil be oblig ed to start for Lon-
don â¢within n few days.
To a Tribune reporter Mr. Bavin said
"I am happy to say that we Irish mem
bers of the House of Commons were tiu
tirst to move in the matter of parlia
memory action in favor of the policy pur
sued by the King of Greece on this ques
tion, it was ihe Irish members who sug
gested and helped to carry through tin
memorial to the King of Greece which
was signed by 100 members o: the Hoisc
of Commons anJ dispatched to him at t
critical moment rive or six weeks aeo.
"Tui* act of ours was fiercely denounced
by the Government in the Home of Com
mons, but we were satisfied that we rep
resented the overwhelming mass of popu
lar leeline in Great liri.ain and Ireland in
our action; and I am confident the me*
saee of encouragement which we sent to
the King from the House of Commons
encouraged him to persevere in a policy
which has the approval of all the friends
of freedom in Europe.
"The action of the English Government
in this Eastern crisis is very reprehensi
ble. It is dictated not by any 3inceie wish
to further the cause 01 liberty in Crete,
but by a wish to uphold what are called
'British interests' in Constantinople and
Turkey. ThoÂ«e interests are represented
oy some $100,030. 0O) 01 English invest
ment*, and Loml Salisbury thinks more of
the interests of English bondholder- than
of the liberty and rights of the Christian
people of Crete in their struggle against
an intolerable tyranny.
â¢â¢With reference to the home rule ques
tion it is for the present and, so far as
parliamentary action goes, in the back
: round; but that will only be for a short
time. Our opponents who are now in
power have a majority of 140 in the House
of Commons, and while they remain in
office there is no chance of our obtaining
Kuch a measure of liberty as we demand.
As I have already pointed out. the Tories
are so unpopular over their policy in the
BÂ«at that they would be defeated by an
overwhelming majority if there conid
be a general election immediately. I do
not expect any such fortunate occurrence
a- an immediate general election, as Lord
Salisbury is under no constitutional obli
gation to resign on account of his blun
ders over the Cretan difficulty; but when
ever he is compelled by choice or political
circumstances to appeal to the electors of
Great Britain and Ireland the Liberals,
who are pledged to concede home rule to
Ireland, â nill be returned lo power, and
we, the Irish members, will insist upon
their making home rule the first item of
thrir lfgisl* tivo programme."
''How do you find the Irish-Americans
on the question of home rule!" was asked.
"Well, I have found in my intercourse
with leaning Irish-Americans in New
York and Chicago as I came alone that
interest in the national cause of Ireland is
as keen as ever among our Iri-h-Amcrican
friends in the United States. These irlends
art, as a matter of course, disheartened
at the divisions which have obtained
during (he last five or six years in the
old country. So long nÂ« these divisions
exist it is not to be expected that we
will obtain from sympathizers on this side
of the Atlantic that measure ot hearty
support which was given to us ten or
twe;ve years aeo, and by means of which
assistance we were enabled to make such
splendid progress with our cause. I am
satisfied, however, that when we are again
reunited, as I expect we shall be within
the next year or two, we will again obtain
from our friends and kindred in the United
States unstinted support in our efforts to
free Ireland from English rule at>d the
curse of Irish landlordism. You may say
to the readers of the Tribune that I am
very hopeful of thÂ« future of the home
rule movement."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 13, 1897.
JACOBS TO GET
THE SUB-TREASURY
Irving M. Dudley Likely to
Be Made the Hawaiian
Minister.
J. W. Ragsda'e of Santa Rosa
Liable to Get the Post at
Ca'cutta.
M j>r McLiushlin Gives Much Inter
esting News Regarding Devel
opments at Washington
Major Frank McLaughlin has returned
here after several weeks in Washlneton.
He says there is no doubt that Colonel
Jackson will get the Collectorship of the
Port and Mr. Leach of Oakland ttie Direc-
torship of the Mint.
"Besides these," said the major, "Julius
Jacobs is slated for the sub-treasury and
John C. Lynch for Internal Revenue Col
lector of the Southern district. Mr.
Spear was originally slated for Col
lector of the Port, but owing to the
opposition of the Senate lie was with
drawn. However, it is pretty certain that
Mr. McKinley will take care of him and
give Him something else.
"If any one eets any of the posts outly
ing from the Coast it will be Irving li.
Dudley of San Diego. He will either be
Minister to Hawaii or go 10 Peru. Idon'i
think young Hswall has any show for
Hawaii. He didn't seem to have the back
ing of the Sanate, and that, by the way,
is something a man for an appointive
office ha* to have. The Senators may, at
times, fight among ttiemselves, but on
these things they move together like a
snowalide. I wish this was Detter under
stood. The Seriate is everything. It's the
big end of things.
"J. W. Ragsdaie of Santa Rosa is a can
didate for Consul to Calcutta, and will
probably get it. I think Milton J. Green,
the attorney, of this City, will probably
eet the consulship to Shanghai. Francis
will be Collector at Los Angeles, and Cap
tain H. Z. Osborne will gÂ«t the United
States marshalsbip. AÂ» to Sheriff Me-
Kenzie's light for ibe marshalship of the
nortuern dstrict I don't know.
''I want to say mat we have a most ex
cellent delegation in Congress. Loud,
Hiluorn and Barbam, 1 think, as Con
gressman rank up with the very best of
them. Sen i tor Perkins is ri^nt in the
front, too. He is on iwo important com
mittees in the Senate and is rapidly be
coming a leader.
"It gives me pleasure to state that the
National Committee are hand in glove
with this committee. We here in Cali
fornia uardlv realize how important our
victory is regarded in the Kust. Califor
nia in consequence is held in the very
higtUMt estimation. And 1 made arrange
ments with Chairman Haiuia and Major
Dick, tac secretary, that will keep our com
mittee in constant touch with the Na
tional Committee.
"All our people should remember in the
distribution of offices that 1 have alluded
to that there are so many applicants that
only one in a hundred, approximately
speaking, can be successful. But I would
earnestly ask tbat you put party above
everything, and stand united and make
it solid.
"Mr. McKenna is a power in Washing
ton. He is looked up to, and I don't be-
Jieve there is a man ttiere wiiom McKin
ley regards higher. As to Mr. Estee and
the judgesbip, th.Â»t came up after I leit."

ROBBED
A TILL IN
BROAD DAY
Bold Sneakthieves Loot a
Ferry Ticket-
Office.
THIRD TIME WITHIN A
MONTH.
Tbe Cash Drawer of the Creek
Route Department Taken
Bcdily.
AGENT M'CABE WAS AT HIS
LUNCH.
One Hundred anl Eight Dollars Se
curedâNo Clew to the Maraud-
ers Faund as Yet.
One of the boldest and most successful
daylight robberies that have annoyed the
police and the victims in some time past
occurred on Saturday last, when the
ticket office of the creek route ferry at the
foot of Market street was looted by sneak
thieyes.
Thn oftice is situated outside of the
main ferry building andj ust soutn of that
structure, the back of the little house
resting against the south end of the bie
building. A wide gate, through which
teams pass on their way to the creek
boats, leads to it and is left open at times
during the day when the traffic is the
heaviest.
At noon on the day mentioned the rob
bers â their number is not known â entered
the office and carried away all of the cash
representing the morning's receipts and
made good their escape without being
discovered. Tuey were not satisfied with
taking the coin, which amounted to $10J<
and a few cents, but took the drawer in
which it was contained along with them.
The gate was open at the time and it is
supposed that they went out as they came
in, mingling with the crowd of workmen
on their wny to their noonday meal, and
then made their way away from the water
lront to escape detection.
The office is in charge of Ticker Agent
McCabe, who was at lunch at the time the
robbery occurred.
Mr. McCabe leaves an assistant to take
bis place while at lunch, and the supposi
tion is thai the thieves, knowing the
agent's habits ana having seen him go
out, wailed until the assistant had cone
out on the wharf to attend to some duty
and ihen toot advantage of their oppor
tunity to secure the money and escape.
They left aoaoluteiy no clew behind them
for the detectives to wort on.
Tne similarity of this robbery to the
one that occurred at the Sausaiito ferry
some time ago, when a considerable sum
wa- secured, has led to the belief that the
same parties were concerned in both
crimes.
It is believed that the robbers will be
located in hangers-on about the ferries
who, being familiar with Mr. McCabe's
daily routine and Knowing that his relief
was busy, saw that it would be easy to
loot the place and escape.
Detectives Siivey and Bagan, who are
on duty on the water front, are working
diligently on the case, and while they
have found no positive evidence, have two
men under surveillance. The detectives
of the railroad company are also bu?y
searching for a clew to the robbers, be
ing nerved by tue fact that this is the
third robbery of railroad ticket-offices that
hag occurred within the past month,.
The first was at the Sausalito ferry, th'n
second at Third and Towusend streets,
and (he third at the creek- route office.
The loss falls particularly heavily on
Agent McCabe, who will probably have
to make good the amount taken unless
the money is recovered, which is quite
improbable.
BULLETS FLEW WIDE.
Alice English, a Young Woman, Took
Several Shots at Â»n Ad
mirer,
Miss Alic* English, a young woman
who resides in the Irvington rooming
house. 418 Ellis street, took a few shots at
a young man Known as Cane, a g'.a
zier by occupation, last Saturday evening,
but fortunately for him the scare was the
worst in jury he suffered.
The shooting it is stated, was the cul
mination of an angry dispute between the
actors in the tragic episode, Cane has
for some time been a frequent visitor at
rooms of the young woman, but of laic
iheir views on several questions relating
to their future happiness have materially
disagreed.
Saturday evening the couple met and
quarreled, and at me climax of the dis
mite Alice English drew a revolver and
tired three shots at Cane in rapid suc
cession.
Tne bullets flew wide of their mark, and
the intended target made a hasty exit.
All tie parties directly or indirectly con
cerned in the controversy have appar
ently combined in an effort to keep the
matier quiet. Consequently it is not at
all likely that any ar:eÂ«tÃ will iollow.
THE TEACHERS' CLUB.

The San Francisco Teachers' Club, at the

LINCOLN A NAME
TO CONJURE WITH
Enthusiasm and Cash for
the Monument Pro
j ?ct.
Every Mail Brings Letters From
Leading; Men of the
Nation.
omniander-in-Chief of the Gi and
Army and State Superintendent of
New York Schools Reply.
The proposed monument in Golden Gate
Park to the memory of Abraham Lincoln
is enlisting the attention and enthusiasm
of leading men of the United States,
Every mail that arrives in San Frnncisco
brings commendatory letters to W. W.
Stone, president of the Lincoln Monu
ment League. Many of the letters inclose
cash contributions for certificates. United
States Senator George C. Perkins sub
scribed for two certificate!â one for him
self and one for Mr. Stone â and signified
his intention to make a larger contribu
tion to the monument in the future.
Yesterday's mail brought a letter from
T. 8. Clarkson, commander-in-chief of
the Grand Army of the Republic, as fol
lows:
HEADQUARTERS (i RAND ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC, )
OMAHA, Neb., April 8. 1897. j
W. W. Stone, president of Lincoln Monument
National Leagueâ Dear in and Comrade: I
nave read wltn great interest the circular of
your league, eeuing forth its object and
methods, and let me say that I am in lull sym
pathy with you in your patriotic undertaking.
I wish a monument to tha martyred Lincoln
might be erected in every pÂ«rk in the land a^
a patriotic lesson to the children, but espe
cially at the Golden Gate as a lesion to visitors
from other countries.
It is VJry appropriate that we should have a
Lincoln day lv all our public schools, when
the children may be especially iinpre>se<i with
the study of the character of that great man.
This, however, should be on February 12 of
each year, the anniversary of his birth. The
Friday belore Memorial day Is devoted In
very many of the States, and t hope soon to
see in all, to talk to the children by the ye -
eraus of the war on the object and lessons ot
Memorial day that tney may fully understand
why we ask them to bring flowers and why we
decorate. Let the day be February 12, and let
the good work go on. Command me. Very
truly yours, T. S. Clarksox,
Commander-in-Chief.
Charles R. Skinner, president of the
National Educational Society and State
Superintendent of New York, wrote the
annexed letter:
State or New York, Department of PtblicJ
Instruction. Albany. April 6. 1897. |
Mr. W. W. Stowe, thai* man Lincoln Monument
League, San Francisco â Dear Sir: I hare your
favor of the Ist inM. iiicios-iug circular relat
ing to ;ho Lincoln Monument League. I have
read your .otter and the circular with great
interest.
I am in thorough sympathy with every
movement looking to patriotic education in
our schools, and I am sure we are improving
every opportunity to impress upon our school
children the importance of that feature of our
educational work. I have always advised that
every National holiday be sacredly oDserved
In our schools, and 1 am confident that
throughout our State there is a general obser
vance of every important day in the calendar
of tne year.
I do not know how thoroughly we can in
terest the people ot this State in erecting a
monument to Lincoln so far away, although
distance can hardly lessen the interest of the
people in the greatest American who ever
lived.
Memorial day has come to be observed in
this State more generally than any other holi
day, and particularly by our schools. We
have also anotner uav in May, which it ob
served by our schoolsâ Arbor day.
I note that Memorial day this year falls upon
Sunday, and of course it will be oDserved upon
pome other day, no doubt in many schools on
Friday, but In others on Monday, "it has been
the custom for many years for our children to
bring flowers to our schoolhouses for the use
of the Grand Army memorial committees. I
have no hesitation in co-operating so far as
possible with all organizations that desire to
mate a special effort in this direciion this
year. Many of our Grand Army people are in
the habit, and have been for many year*, of
visiting our schools on that day and making
appropriate addresses.
I shall be glad to heiir from you further, and
if I can be of any service in widening or deep
ening the Interest in Memorial duy exercises
it will be a great pleasure to do so. Yours
very sincerely, Charles R. Skinner,
State Superintendent.

THE AUGUSTA IS
IN HOME WATERS
Frank J. Mo'fitt Owns the
Fastest Launch on the
Bay.
A. Model of Neatness, Comfort
and Art From the Figure-
Head to the Fiagstaff.
Many New lieas Never Before At
tempted on Pleasure Craft
Built on th B.y.
The swiftest and coziest pleasure launch
on the bay, the Augusta, bas just been
brought over to her moorings in the Oak
l land estuary. She was built for Frank J.
Moffitt of Oakland, and is the cleverest
in every particular ever built on this coasi.
Art and comfort predominate from the
very stem. The figurehead is an original
carved figure and the scroll work from it
follows along either side of the bow for
| many feet, forming a rail to the forward
i deck.
Immediately abaft the forward bulkhead
is a semi-circular pilot-bouse. By a neat
little wheel the pilot handles the craft
while being enabled to keep a sharp look
out nearly all around the horizon.
Next to the pilot-house, on the star
board side, is the engine-room, in which
there is a powerful piece of machinery,
' capable of propelling the craft thirteen
miles an hour. It is a easoline engine,
one of the latest patterns of 1897, with all
j the improvements and perfections sug-
g ested by the engineers who have had ex
perience with that model. As a result the
machinery is almost silent.
The saloon is, as it should bo, the piece
de resistance of the boat. All around are
! large windows from wolch -ursts can re
ceive the full pleasure of the view without
: any of the unpleasantness ol wind or
j spray. The windows are hung with pretty
curtains, which are chosen to match the
delicately patterned carpet on the floor
and the richly corduroy upholstered cush
ions which are placed on either side. A
pretty shade of olive green has been
cbosen for the upholstery, and it presents
a charming harmony of color with tne
richly polished mahogany wainscoting,
which is used all over, not only the saloon,
but every portion ol the boar.
While within all is suggestive of com
fort and ease, without everything is indi
cative of strength, and the Augusta could
certainly stand a very heavy stretch of
bad weather without in any way doing
herseli any injury or causing any discom
fort to those on ooard.
I>. M. Vanwart, the designer, in layine
I her lines, departed somewhat from the
old conservative models and chose a
design which experience has suggested is
best litted for a pleasure craft. The exact
measurements of the Augusta are: Ex
treme length 38 feet 6 inches, beam 7 leet
6 inches, average deptn 4 feet 6 inches.
The draught of water, owing to the novel
lines on which the keel is laid, is 2 feet 8
inches forward and 3 feet 8 inches aft.
