LONDON, Ex... April 16.â A dispatch
from t:.e Greek army's headquarters at

on the frontier. Artillery was largely

The city of Salonica itself and the lines of communication with Elassano and Grevena,. where the Turkish armies on tbe
frontier are stationed, are dangerously exposed to attack by way of the Gulf of Salonica. The waters of the upper part of the
gulf are broad and deep, and batteries placed on the eastern bank, which is high, can be avoided by hugginp* the shore, and
the Greek war vessels could come right up to the city, the batteries on Point Mavro, four miles south, offering little hindrance.
Or they can go up the main mouth of the Vardar River as far as the stone bridge, over which passes the roads to Mbnastir,
Veria and Grevena. and cut off . communication with those points . except by a very roundabout way via Uskub. â¢ This has
necessitated the adoption of long and expensive lines of defense, involving a line of torpedoes' from Cape Kara on the eastern
side of the gulf across to Atherida Point, some fifteen miles aoove Katerina, and a line of fortifications on down the coast to
the latter place, where the road to Elassano strikes up over the mountains through Petra Pass. ,

HAVANA, Cuba, April 16.â The latest
{ news from Madrid is that the efforts made
I by tbe Spanish Government in an agree
j ment with j private companies to recruit
| volunteers for the war bave failed com
pletely. An appeal was made to tbe
country to send 6300 volunteeis tore
enforce the Spanish army here, but only
200 enlisted.
The: Republican newspapers of Madrid
say that this failure wa* uue to the reports
of great suffering among tbe Spanish sol
diers, a lack ot food and slowness of pay
ment of the troop*. The Republican
leader, Francisco Marcail, in a letter to a
friend in Havana says:
"The failure to recruit volunteers for
Cuba proves t'*at the nation is tired of
that bloody war in which Spain . is achiev
; ing her ruin- and. losing her best young
! men. The Government thought that the
| calling out more -reserves, now that the
deadly rainy season is so near the island,
would meet with the opposition of the in
dependent press and of liberal public opin
ion. The recruiting of volunteers was a
crooked way taken to arrive at the same
end, but the -country has answered 'No
more blood, no more victims.' "

mander Jaqueneau of tee lost steamship
Yille St. Nazaire of the sinking of his ves
sel and- the subsequent horrors in Ine life

advances the positive opinion, not before

fore the leak was discovered, many on
board experienced â¢a- violent shock as
though she had struct, a hard substance.
The captain says he is positive a dere

were ma ie to ' reach ' land, but they were
driven back by -westerly winds. Several
occupants of tbe: boat went mad. Those
afflicted with erotic insanity fancied they
saw women and even corps de ballet.
That was probably because there was a
great number of fish of strange form
sporting on ; top of the water around the
boat. These fish, dancing in waves, did
re.illy in some degree look like women.
With their long fins: ending in what re

After a Quarter of a Century of
Faithful Labor the Official Is
':*X\ Treacherously Killed.
SOMERSWORTH, N. H., April 16.âJo
seph A. Stickney, the aged treasurer and
cashier of the Great Falls National Bank,
was alone in the building ten minutes after
noon to-day. When his assistant, a young
woman named Swasey, left him he was
busy on an account which he wished to
finish before leaving the bank ior dinner.
An hour later he was found lying on
the floor with a battered head and a grew
some knife wound in the throat extend
ing from ear to ear. Marks on the head
suggested the use of a blackjack, and the
belief is that the murderer crept quietly
in while the old man was engaged with
his figures and struck him down before
be had a chance to utter a sound. Just
$9100 in cash was taken by the murderer
and robber. .Of this $2500 was in gold, and
tbe balance bills. There was a large amount
of money represented in chicks and other
negotiable paper, -but these were not
touched, a circumstance .which seems to
indicate that tbe robber was not ne.v in
the business. . -_
Somersworth has a population of about
8000. The bank is in a two-story and half
building, up one* flight. Underneath is a
harness store. It is evident that no at
tempt was - made to enter the building
until everybody had left j it for luncheon.
The noon whistles had scarcely ceased
sounding when the assistant cashier had
donned her wraps and started for home.
The proprietor of the harness-shop and
apprentice left soon after. This left the
building with but one occupant, Stickney,
and be undoubtedly was so busy that he
failed to notice his slayer until he was
close upon bim. The door from the entry
at the bead of the stairs, leading to tbe
banking rooms, opens directly in front of
the . cashier's window. The theory is
that the cashier was struck through tbe
window. The door leading through to the
cashier, and where the money was, was
i slight and lightly built, and tbis was
broken. â  *
The murderer must have been greatly
excited, for the old man's head was
bruised, his skull fractured, and the black
jack used on him was broken, for the
leather-covered leaden bulb was found
close to the body when the alarm was
given. What weapon was used to cut the
old man's throat is not known, as none
was found. The murderer must, however,
have _een coverei with blood. It is be
lieved that only one person was directly
, concerned, and tbat he came prepared2
with a flour sack to carry away the booty.
Main street is practically deserted dur
ing the noon hour. There were several
people who remembered after the murder,
was made known seeing a stranger with a
bag over his back running down the
street.
About 12:30 o'clock a Mr. Cheney was
about his place when he saw a strange
man in a light overcoat and light felt hat
vault the fence surrounding Dr. Hayes'
orchard on Prospect Hill. The stranger
walked well into the orchard until he
came to a pile of brush. At this point
Cheney's attention was diverted for a mo
ment, and when he again looked toward
the brush heap the stranger had changed
hats and then wore a dark-colored Derby.
Then be saw him toss the bag behind the
orchard wall. The stranger then left the
orchard and started down Linden street.
In a few minu.es he apueard driving a
chestnut horse. He was seated in a buggy
with another man, and when he reached
the orchard he left the carriage. He went
to the place where Cheney had seen him
throw the bag. -He had taken <ff his
overcoat, and when be started for the car
riage again he had the ba? and endeav
ored to cover the bag with this garment
He jumped into the buggy and drove off
at top speed.
It was nearly 2 o'clock bafore there was
any suspicion that a crime had been com
mitted.
At that hour one of the local merchants,
Frank Reed, went up the stairway leading
to the bank, and found the plate -.lass in
the doorway leading into the bank broken.
He tried the door and it was locked.
Hurrying out to the street be reported the
matter, and the police were soon on the
scene. â¢ â¢ .'i* '. :Â» ;.â _'.. C.T.. -
Con Hardi^an and John Briggs. local
boxers, were arrested in Waltham, Mass.,
ibis afternoon on suspicion. Both admit
having been to Somersworth during the
forenoon, but say they left there at 10
o'clock and arrive lin Boston at 12. They
claim to have remained one hour or two
at Boston before coming to Waltham, On
thÂ« other hand, a dispatch to the Waltham
officers from the New Hampshire authori
ties, says the men were in Somersworth as
late as 12:30. When arrested, Hardiean
had about $80 in his pockets, but Briggs
was "broke." Briggs was intoxicated
when arrested, and says he does not re
member anything that has happened
during the last few days, as he has been
on a debauch. .:."*-. r ?Pi':\&\ â '"* 'â ',', V
It is claimed by the friends of Hardican
that the pair went to Somersworth to see
some friends. One of tne prisoners has
been identified as the man who robbed a
farmer yesterday.
â¢ Mr. Stickney had a son and two daugh
ters. He bad been employed in the bank
twenty-five years and was 65. Five years
ugo an attempt was made to rob the same
bank. Stickney was gagged and tied up,
but the robbers were not successful in ef
fecting an entrance to the vault.
At a meeting of the directors of the
bank to-night an offer of $1000 reward was
offered for the arrest of the murderer.
Another reward of $100. is offered for the
return of the money. About $5000 of the
city's money, which was in Stickney's
keeping as City Treasurer, was also taken.
Tbis amount was in bills.
DEAD WO Ait IN A BUGGY.
Murdered From Ambush by a Jealous
Husband While Dr ying With a
Gallant Soldier Boy.
â  SYRACUSE. N. V., April 16.â Early
this morning the proprietors of one of tbe
livery stables in Sacketts , Harbor were
horrified when one of their horses came
trotting up to the door of the stable draw
ing a buggy containing the bodies of two
deai women. There was no driver, tbe
horse having made its way alone to tbe
stable.
. The boggy had been hired the night be
fore by Georee Allen, a soldier stationed
at Madison Barracks. There was nothing
about the vehicle to tell what bad become
of him.
: An examination of the two bodies
showed tbat the women had been mur
dered. They had been shot and stabbed,
and the bodies were badly mangled with
a knife. They were identified as Mrs.
William Crouch and Miss Mary Daly.
As soon as possiole a search was made
to ascertain the story of the crime. A
party started out in the direction from
which the horse bad come. It bad gone
but a short distance when Alien was met
staggering along the road toward town.
He baa been badly hurt, was dripping
with water and seemed to be in a dazed
condition. He was taken to the barracks,
where he was sufficiently restored to be
able to make a statement. - Vi â >
- According to the story told by Allen the
murder was committed by the husband of
Mrs. Crouch. He had long been insanely
Jealous oi her and bad made her life so
miserable that she bad finally brought
suit lor divorce. This had made Crouch
extremely angry, and he had, according
to Allen, threatened to make her regret
her action.
I While they were driving along the
Waterloo road last night near Sacketts
Harbor Crouch suddenly arose from the
side of the road, where lie had evidently
been waiting, and opened fire on the party
in the buggy. Allen knew little of what
had occurred, as be was struck and be
came senseless, but tbe two women must
have been Killed at that time. Crouch
evidently thinking Allen dead threw him
into a nearby stream, where the cold
water revived him. He crawled out of the
water and succeeded in making bis way to
town. It is believed that be will die.
NOT GREATER THAN THE LAW.
Citizens cf Indianapolis Show the Street
car Companies That They Must
Accept 3- Cent Fares.
\ INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., April There
has been intense excitement all day over
the action of tbe street-railroad company
in defying the law for 3-cent fares. This
morning the citizens banded together for
the protection of passengers and defied
the company's employes to eject them.
Early this morning companies of ten or
twenty citizens stood at the street corners
and boarded the cars for the express pur
pose of seeing that tbe company accept
tbe legal fare. When J the conductors
asked one for a 5-cent fare and upon re
fusal to pay tried to eject him he found
tenor a dozen determined men ready to
assist the passenger. In one case a man
was kicked in the stomacn by the motor
man and a riot was averted only by turn
ing op the current and taking the car
away from the excited crowd. Many con
ductors; seeing that tbe citizens were de
termined, accepted the legal fare. The
many* contentions of the morning pro
. duced so much feeling, that Mayor Tag
gert called upon President Mason of the
company, and he agreed that 3 cents be
accepted as fare till the. case pending in
the courts is decided. To-night the Grand
Jury returned indictments against Presi
. dent Mason and Superintendent Elliott
for violating the law. Other, indictments
will be returned against them.

ALARMED BY THE
JAPANESE INFLUX
So Hawaiian Represen- !
tatives Renew Request
for Annexation."
Too Many Subjects of the
Mikado Landing for
Safety.
It Is Said That McKinley and Sher
man Are In Favor of Annex
' ing: the Islands.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April 16.â One
of the' Hawaiians who is here urging an
nexation is representing to members of
Congress and the State Department that
be is seriously 'alarmed over the prospect
that Japan miy gain dominion over the
islands unless this Government takes
speedy action. He complains that the
matter of annexation languishes in the
office of the Secretary of State, It has also
been pigeonholed in the office of .the
President. '-' : -i..'i'
Some weeks ago came news that there
was an unusual influx of Japanese into
Honolulu. At the headquarters of the
ex-Queen here this was 'understood to
mean something more than the mere
flocking of an unusual number of emi
grants to the island. It was colonization
for a purpose. The movement of Japanese
to the island in large numbers is, how
ever, not a thing of the past few months.
The recent report made by the Depart
ment of Foreign Affairs of the Dole Gov
ernment, of which Mr. Sherman has a
copy, shows that tbis colonization- has
been going on for four years.
Recently, however, a whole boatload of
the Japanese of the more intelligent class
went over to Honolulu, and tbis was the
circumstance which opened the eyes of
this Government. Among the latest arri
vals were many students from Japanese
colleges. These, evidently did not go
there for the purpose of trying the new
coffee boom or of working on the sugar
plantations.
Before tbis, however, the Japanese
movement had been noted by the repre
sentatives of the Government who came
to tbis country. Among them were Gen
eral Hart well, who wrote about tbe abdi
cation which ex-Queen Lilioukalani
signed and gave to Attorney-General
Smith of the Hawaiian republic. It was
undenied that the object of their visit was
to renew interest in the annexation
scheme, which was in a fair way to ac
complishment when Mr. Cleveland with
drew the treaty from the Senate. The
Hawaiian representatives were informed
soon after the inauguration of President
McKinley that the annexation plans
would have to wail till 'the tariff matter
was out of the way â that is to say, until it
was disposed of by the House. '"'.':"'
Conferences which bave evidently meant
nothing have been held between Secretary
Sherman and Mr. Hatch and the Attor
ney-General, although it was stated tbat
these conferences were merely informal.
They have been so informal that General
Hartwell, the chief legal adviser of tbe
Dole Government at its formation and
who was here on the annexation business,
bas left the city and gone to Boston. It
was tbe intention of tbe Hawaiian repre
sentatives to have the old treaty sent to
tbe Senate, or to ask for a commission, or
to have tbe question of annexation, fail
ing in both of the other two plans, opened
up in tbe House. All of these plans, it
was stated to-night, have failed.
President McKinley and Secretary Sher
man both favor annexation, however. If
Mr. McKinley should send the old treaty
to tbe Senate and it should be disposed
of in short order, as is very likely,
considering tbe temper of the Repub
lican Senators on the question to say
nothing of Democratic support, it would
have to go to the -House and Mr. Reed
would have to appoint a committee to
consider it. This, however, would run
counter to tbe House programme which
Mr. Reed is carrying out, not merely for
himself, but for every interest expecting
to be benefited by tbe new tariff bill.
Mr. Reed and the House adjournments
have cut off the hope of the' presentation
of the Hawaiian matter by any member
of the House, and so the Dole Government
stands, or will stand as long as it can. If
it fails, as itissaid it may, by reason ot its
increasing public debt, nothing can pre
vent first a Japanese protectorate and then
Japanese occupation.
Secretary Sherman was asked to-night
if there was anything new in the situa
tion. He said that there was nothing at
all startling in the present condition of
affairs. He said that the going to Hawaii
of tbe Philadelphia was of no importance,
or of any other American ships. "Why
ships," he said, '*go there every day."
PEARY WON'T COME HERE.

WASHINGTON, D.C.; April 16.â Owing
to the intercession of friends of Lieutenant
Peary, Secretary Long baa ..revoked the
order detaching Peary from the Brooklyn
Navy-yard and ordering him 'to the

He is particularly anxious to remain on
duty at Brooklyn. The surprise .of . his
lriends was great when they read be bad
been detailed to the Pacific Slope. ';,'.
The investigation led them to believe
that. the detail was made for the purpose
of clipping Peary's wings and prevent him
gaining additional prominence.
Charles Moore, Peary's friend, came to
Washington yesterday for tbe purpose ot
getting Peary's orders revoked. ;He se
cured the co-operation of Senator Hanna

a talk with President McKinley and also
Secretary Long. L" The â  President said he
would find out what could be done. The
result was tbat Secretary Long to-day an

j night the river rose two inches, but it is
stationary now at Omaha and falling
above. Work on the dykes during the
night held back the flood, and this morn
ing it seems the gravest danger is passed.
. DAVENPORT, lowa, April 16. -A seven
inch rise has brought the waters of the
Mississippi to within six inches of the
danger line. The rising flood bas invaded
the cellars of many jobbing-bouses and
tbe levee is almost entirely under water.
Muscatine Island, the great melon-rais
ing -ground, is reported to be largely un
der water. Rain continues. nearly every
day and the situation daily becomes more
serious. Â
* In the neighborhood of Burlington,
lowa, the river is six miles- wide and
, covers a wide area of valuable bottom
, farm land in Illinois. The farmers there
. bave given up hope of getting in their
. J crops and much loss will result. IThe
. river is still rising. ' .
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 16.âSec
retary Alger has received a telegram from
- one of his inspecting officers at Cairo, who
â  bas been working in. the Yazoo district,
which says: J "I have completed the in
spection of the upper portion of my dis
trict from Ashport to Cairo and find the
, conditions slightly improved. The most
I extensive crevasse below Caruthersville
has widened to 3200 feet.
"The waters are stationary at Cairo, but
[ are rising below there. ''About- 2001 ref
ugees from this section are collected at
points on the high ground. I have lo
cated and noted the approximate number
of established relief stations and com
municated the necessary details â  to Cap
tain Davis, who *is forwarding ? supplies
from Memphis. This point is the natural
center for general distribution by small
, semi-weekly packets that know, the land
, ings and are expected to be more satisfac
. Tory ana economical than the chartered
boats. All tbe relief -stations but two are
i already supplied from Memphis with five.
1 days' rations."
Anotber army inspector telegraphed
from Greenville, Miss., tbat the total are i
subject to the : overflow in â . his district is
about 4000 square miles, mostly ia Phil
lips County, Ark.,, and Coahoma, Quit-
man, Bolivar, Sunflower and Washington
counties in Mississippi.
It is suggested that ten days' supply of
rations . be sent at tbe earliest practicable
moment to supply 1000 destitute persons
and 100 bead of stock in Quitman County,
in , which thirteen townships are inun
dated; also 5000 destitute persons and 500
head of stock in Coahoma County, where
twelve townships are flooded; for 8000
destitute and 800 stock in Bolivar County,
where nine townships are inundated. On
the Arkansas side it is reported that there
aie 5000 destitute and 400 livestock in Phil
lips and Monroe counties requiring assist
ance. Thirty to forty dava is the esti
mated period of time before the laborers
can go to work in the inundated area, but
a-j tbis period will vary with the locality
the inspector recommends tbat no sup
plies be sent for a longer period than ten
days.
MANY SEE AN AIRSHIP.
Reputable Citizens of Several States
:-' Declare That Aerial Navigation
I J Is Solved.
BIRMINGHAM, lowa, April 16.âWil
liam Walters, living near this city, is re
sponsible for the statement tbat be and
several others saw an airship settle down
on the meadow a mile from this city this
morning. They ran toward it, but when
within one hundred yards, it rose grace
fully into the air. Two men were plainly
seen in the car. Tbe machine was one
hundred- feet long and twenty feet broad
in the center, tapering to points. When
it rose it made a whirring sound like a
circular saw.'
CLARKSVILLE. le***--., April 16.â Two
local warehouse men, tbree merchants
and ' four city officers saw an airship last
night. Tbey say ii was about a mile high
and traveled from east to tbe northwest.
The citizens are watching for it to-night.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 16.â The citi
zens of Russelville, the county seat of
Logan County, say they saw an airship
last night. Mayor Andrews, City Clerk
McCutchen, James McCutcben, the oldest
and wealthiest merchant in tbecity, and
Dr. Charles Fortband, men of unques
tioned standing, declare tbey saw the
strange aerial cruiser circle around the city
for ten minutes before sailing off to tbe
west.
WATERLOO, lowa, April 16.â This sec
tion is much excited over an airship or
living machine, which was first observed
here at daybreak to-day. The stranger in
charge says it is a flying machine and that
be landed here to make repairs. He will
resume his voyage to-morrow. He keeps
all the people at a distance of several hun
dred yards from tbe machine, and there
fore many do not credit bis story, but
think it a fake designed to create a sensa
tion. Just what object the man bas to
gain is a mystery, as he has not asked for
money from the hundreds who have vis
ited the field to take a look at tbe thing.
It is about forty feet long and constructed
like a giant cigar, with winglike attach
ments on t-he side and a steering apparatus
in the rear. The whole is surmounted by
a cupola or lookout chair on the roof. The
queer craft appears to be built of canvas,
subjected to a heavy coat of varnish. The
pipe leading from the cone of the thing
constantly emits a vapor, as if tbe motor
power were steam. The man in charge is
a stranger, in this section and /carries a
rifle to keep the people from too closely
examining the machine. He secured per
mission from the farmer on whose land
be is to keep bis machine for a few days.
The man says he is on a voyage around
the world, but was forced to- alight for re
pairs, and that if tbe people do not believe
he can fly through the ulr they can wait a
day or two and he will give them a very
startling free exhibition. *'* 'â _.â  J/.'/l
'â  Late to-night the owner told a straight
story of how, in company with a Mr.
Stormont, he left San Francisco March
J 20, and gave every detail of tbe voyage op
to the' time of landing. It is said now tbe
whole affair is a hoax and tne' machine
j was built by a local wag for the purpose
, of creating a sensation. . <

THAT ALASKA
BOUNDARY TREATY
Discovery of a "Joker"
That Will Delay Its
Ratification.
Peculiar Clause That Means
the Abandonment of Much
Territory.
Senators Detect the Bait In, Ime
to Prevent Some Interesting
Complications.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 16. -Mr.
Cleveland sent to the Senate on January
30 the Alaskan boundary convention ar
ranged between Pauncefote, British Min
ister, and Olney, which still rem. ins un
disposed of. At the opening of the present
session: Senator Davis, ~ chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, ex
plained the treaty at length and urged its
speedy ratificstion, stating that by its
terms the country would gain a large ad
dition of valuable territory. Stewart ob
jected to tho consideration of the treaty
at tbat time. Davis has hot since called
it up and apparently for good reasons.
lt is now discovered that the third clause
in the agreement, by which we were said
to gain about fourteen square miles of
territory through the liberality of tbe
British Government, contained a blow
fatal to our interests. Certain Senators,
who have been investigating, feel assured
that the wording of the third clause of
tbe first article providing that notwith
standing the summit of Mount St. Elias
is within the Canadian bounds 'the Cana
dian Government is willing to divide it
with the United States is really a bait to
entice the United States into a complete
abandonment of our "ten-marine-league"
claim throughout tbe "thirty-mile strip"
between tbe one hundred and forty-first
meridian, west longitude, and head of
Portland Canal.
In other words the : Canadians propose
to put the United States on record as
dividing with them the summit of a
mountain that lies within our "thirty
mile strip. Using this point of false
departure as a prec9de.it of our own mak
ing tbe Canadians would insist upon ap
plying the rule all the way down the coast
of tbe islands and maintain it to the
moutb of Portland Canal. Tbe appli
cation of the rule would cost the United
States practically all of the territory in
that region worth having and which this
Government claims.
The summit of Mount St. Elias lies
wholly within tha intersection of our "ten
marine leagues" line within the one
hundred and forty-first meridian. ' Fol
lowing the official acknowledgment
ot that fact it may be found in
tbe Canadian "sessional" papers and tbe
joint report of tbe commissioners appoint
ed under : article I of. the convention
between the United States of America and
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland for the delimitation of the bound
ary line between the United States and
the Dominion of Canada, dividing Alaska
from British Columbia. The report shows
that tbe summit of Mount â  St. Elias. is in,
by best determination, latitude 60.17 35.10
and longitude 140.55 47.32, being 28.830
nautical miles from the line of the coast
west of Yakutat Bay and 2.41 statute
i miles east of the one hundred and
forty-first meridian. The report is signed
by W. W. Duffield, United States Commis
sioner, and W. F. King, her Majesty's
Commissioner.

NOT JOHN ST SON'S WIDOW.
Decision in a Boston Court in Which
Adah Richmond Is Cut Out of ...
aÃ g Estate.
BOSTON, Maps., April 16.â Adah Rich
mond is not the lawful widow of John
Stetson Jr., because when he was married
to her in Providence in 1870 be was the
legal hu--band of Maivina Woodsum.
This is, in brief, the decision rendered by.
Judge Morton to-day. He says in part:
'â¢The first thing to be determined is
how far the appellant is bound to go in
showing that* she is the widow of the
testator. I think that she is not bound to
establish conclusively that there was a
valid marriage subsisting at the death of
Stetson, but tbat it should appear with at
least a reasonable degree of certainty that
such was tbe case. lam not satisfied that
it does so appear. The marriage which is
alleged to have taken place In Providence,
R. 1., in December, 1870, was invalid by
reason of the fact that Stetson had a
former wife '.then living and undivorced.
In addition I am not satisfied that there
was any such ceremony. Neither am 1
satisfied that the cohabitation in New
York was of a matrimonial character.
Her home has been for twenty years in
New York. There is no evidence that
during that time she made any claim tbat
it was with Stetson or that be was bound
to furnish her one. The conduct of Stet
son also seems inconsistent with a belief
that there was a valid marriage. If there
was then bis marriage to Kate Stokes was
willfully bigamous, which is hardly to be
presumed even in his case."
The case will be appealed on exception**.
The estate is valued at $500,000, and goes
by tbe decision to the Stotes family.

IS YET ALIVE
Authentic Letters Are
Received From the
Supposed Victim.
Now the Mystery, of the Body
Found in the Trunk Is
Deepened.
It Is Possible That the Murdered
Man Was Joanes Prosper Cha
zal of France.
CHICAGO. 111.. April 16.â Oliver Pike,
the supposed victim of the Salt Lake
trunk mystery, is alive in California and
has written to his mother at Fayette,
Ohio, where his body was supposed to be
buried. To the Fayette Record be has
also written tbat he ba? been living under
the name of Harry Price since leaving
Puget Sound and is now at Redlands. The
letters to the newspaper and bis motb6i J
are regarded as authentic.
The reappearance of Pike deepens tbe
trunk mystery. On March 23 of last year
Phillip Gries and Charles Haas of Austin
purchased a large box at auction from auc
tioneers who were selling a large quantity
of unclaimed freight for the Chicago and
Northwestern Railroad. Two days after
the box was opened at Austin and found
to contain a medium-sized green trunk,
bound with iron strips. The space be
tween the trunk and the sides of the box
was packed with sawdust. Several layers
of white oilcloth were wrapped around the
trunk. Within the trunk was a zinc box,
the cover soldered tight. This box was
also wrapped in oilcloth. Within the in
ner box was found the decomposed body
of a man. It had been bound with a light
rope so as to fit compactly in the box, and
some chemicals had been placed around
it to destroy tbe flesh.
The box was shipped from Salt Lake,
Utah, on the morning of February 28,
1883. It was left at the freight office of
the Union Pacific at that place the day
before by a man giving the name of G. M.
Mo rgan, and was billed to G. If. Morgan,
146 Jefferson street, Chicago. The freight
was prepaid and the shipper tooK a train,
ostensibly for this city, the same day. It
was shipped as household goods and
weighed 540 pounds. The box arrived in
C . icago February 16 and remained in the
Chicago and Northwestern freight depot
until July. 28, 1893. It was unclaimed and
notices sent to the address on the box
elicited no reply. On that date it was de
livered to the warehouse belonging to the
auctioneers, where it remained for nearly
three year?. On February 9 it was de
cided to sell the box at auction, to get
back tbe freight and storage charges. A
notice was then sent to the consignee at
Salt Lake that be would be given until
February 28 to pay the charges and re
deem it. No reply being received, the
box was soul, and the discovery of the
body followed.
The address at 166 South Jefferson street
it the home of Mrs. Frederick A. Mueller.
She knew nothing of the man Morgan,'
who shipped the box, except that an ex
pressman had called a few weeks before
the bus. was sold and asked for G. M. Mor
gan. An examination of the body dis
closed the fact that the skull bad been
fractured in two places, plainly indicating
a murder. The blows were supposed to
have been struck with a hatchet.
Two clews were followed by the police.
Henry Devereand Bas Marcel, two French
men living here, told a story of the disap
pearance of a friend of theirs, named
Joanes Prosper Chazal, at Salt Lake, dur
ing February of 1893. No trace of " him
has ever been found. Chazal was a native
of Lyons, France, and was well-to-do.
The two men identified the body as being
that of their friend, and strongly main
tained that everything pointed to the cor
rectness of their suspicions that be had
been murdered for his jewels, of which be
always wore a collection of great value.
The second theory was that the body
was that of Oliver Pike, and that he had
been murdered in Seattle, Wash. His
relatives identified the body and had it
taken to Fayette for burial. He disap
peared from Seattle July 3, 189-', and was
never heard from until a few days ago,
when he wrote to hi. relatives, It was
thought that Pike had been murdered
from damaging evidence he possessed
concerning the operations of an insane
asyum at Steilacoom, Wash. An inves
tigation was made, but no definite proof
was ever established that Pike had been
done away with by the suspected persons
at the Steilacoom Asylum, and the matter
was dropped.
Mrs. A. T. Mosher and C. G. Goriot, j
cousins of .Pike, were seen last night in j

munication with the missing man's
mother, and stated that she believed her
son was still alive and tbat a mistake had
been made in theidentificaion of the body
found in the trunk. at Austin. Presents
had been received by Pike's sisters pur
porting to come from htm, and he had
also sent a photograph. Still the strange !
actions of the missing man in . the past !
three years have made many of the rela- 1
tives doubt whether be is really still i
alive. They attribute the report that he j
is at Redlanas and the writing of the
letters to the men who are interested in
the money which the missing Frenchman '
left on deposit in a Salt Lake bank.
In a letter received by Pike's mother
be stated that he would return to bis
home in Fayette, Ohio, - some time in
June. His cousin, Mr. Goriot, intimated
tbat Pike had. gotten into some trouble
out in Washington and bad a purpose
in wanting to lose his identity for a time.
RETJCEAT, RUT MXSTERIOUS.
Oliver Pike, Alias Barry Price, Work-
ing in a Laundry
LOS ANGELES, Cal..' April 16.â The
famous Salt Lake "trunk mystery" baa
been revived in a strange and singular
manner. Oliver Pike, whose remains were
supposed to have been fully identified and
duly interred at Fayette, Ohio, it has
been ascertained is v.ry much alive, was
a recent resident of this city and is now
working in a laundry in Redlands, San
Bernardino Count}'. For some inexplicable
reason Pike assumed the nanus of .Harry
Price and now claims to have been known
by that name ever since the ghastly trunk
inclosure in Chicago of June last and
which was shipped from Salt Lake in 1892.
Diligent inquiry here to-night by a, Call
corre-pondent resulted in establishing the
following:
In the month of May, 1895, Harry Price
applied to Hummel Bros.' employment
bureau for work in a laundry ; and subse
â¢- -i*t-_i rjâ Â» â mm mx â â â im p_,i_ ...i mim...
quently, in August,' lÃ96, he made a sim
ilar application. Price gave his address
as 109 West Seventh street, city, on
both occasions.
The landlady at that number stated to
a" Call correspondent this afternoon that
Price had gone to Redlands. to work, but
she pointedly re i used to say whether he
was married or single or tbat she know
anything touching bis past life.
Piice, or Pike, was located and inter
viewed by telephone to-night at Redlands.
He was very loath to discuss the matter
in any form, insisting that he bad made a
full explanation in a letter to tbe Fayette
(Ohio) Record, so far as be was concerned,
and wben reminded that this "explana
tion" rather deepened than cleared up the
mystery he said:
"There have been false reports already
printed about this matter, and it is haidly
worth while to refute them all; but I
shall make no explanation except In
refutation of such reports."
When reminded' that this was a very
absurd position to take he intimated that
he could clear the matter up if he had a
mind to, but in io doing he might em
barrass some of his friends.

Gorgeous Triumphal Arches,
Parades, Picnics and
â¢ Banquets.
Complete Programme for the
Week's Entertainmentâ Citizens
Actively at Work.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., April 16.â The
main topic of 'conversation,- the one en
grossing theme in Redwood City and
vicinity, to-day, is the coming celebration
of the Grand Parlor of the Native Sons of
the Golden West. The week commencing
April 26 is to be a gala week indeed. Red
wood is already beginning to put on her
holiday attire. *
A little over a year ago this city showed
her hospitality in entertaining the Grand
Council of Red Men. At that time she
proved herself equal to the occasion. The
unanimous opinion of the delegates at
tending that convention was that they,
had never received a more royal welcome.
The Native Sons .will not be tbe
only ones to enjoy this auspicious occa
sion. In return for the kindly and sub
stantial assistance received from the citi
zens, the entertainments are so arranged
that all will at least have the pleasure of
enjoying a part.
The school trustees have consented to
declare a vacation during that week, and
have given the privilege of erecting a
grand bandstand in front of the new
school building. Directly opposite and in
front of the Courthouse will be erected
raised seats for the accommodation of
tho-e desiring to enjoy the open-air con
certs to be given every afternoon from 3
to 5 o'clock, and every evening from 7 to
9 o'clock. Â
The Native Sons believe that what was
done then can be done again. The Native
Sons have an abundance of friends; in
fact, they have "money to burn," a- will
be demonstrated by the grand display of
fireworks arranged for. -The citizens, city
officials, county officers and Native Sons
are working together in perfect harmony.
They realize that it remains for them to
make the impression the members of the
Grand Parlor and visitors will take away
with them.
The music to be rendered at these con
certs is to be one of the c ief att rations of
the Grand Parlor week. No expense. has
been spared to procure the best music
available. Roncovieri's band of San
Francisco has been hired lor the' entire
session. A special feature of the evening
concerts will be illustrated and descrip
tive music.
The thoroughfares will bo resplendent
with streaming banners, waving flags and
gorgeous bunting. Arches will be erected
in different parts of the city, covered with
branches of redwood trees, symbolical of
the place. The arches will be surmounted
by faces and scenes familiar to and revered'
by Native > Sons throughout the State.
Lines of lighted Chinese lanterns * and an
electrical display will combine to illumine
the uight. 1 'â .**

Her. Claim Causes Consternation
Among: Attorneys for Dis
tant Relatives.
:; STOCKTON, Cal., 1 April There was
a sensation in Judge Budd's .department
of the Superior Court this forenoon. An
other claimant to the big estate of George
A. Kasson cropped up to-day, and another
chapter was added to the sensational liti
gation that has grown out of the probate
of the' will of the wealthy West Side
rancher. "
When the question came up this fore
noon of the substitution of Attorney J. A.
Percy for Attorney Knox, as the repre-
sentative of Administrator McChesney,
Attorney William Washington- presented
a petition asking the court to recognize no
heirs save Mrs. Mary Mann of Arkansas,
who claims to be the only child and the
legitimate daughter of the late Mr. Kasson.
Now, at the same table with ashing
ton was the representative of Denson and
De Haven, attorneys for George W. Lindy.
bo claims to be the only child and legiti
mate son of Kasson.
When Attorney Washington finished
reading the startling document, which
threatens to cut a great figure in the case,
all* the other attorneys were on their feet
with protests,' and F. H. Gould asked the
court not to recognize Washington as an
attorney In the case, as he bad no power
of attorney or authority from Mary Mann
to file the petition. The others also pro
tested, but Judge Budd intimated that he
did not desire to keep out any just claim
ant. â 
Washington hurried out of the court
and â  would . tell nothing about the new
claimant. '.* He * seemed *.: to be afraid tbat
the other attorneys would learn what he
claimed to know about Mrs. Mann, the
Arkansas .widow. It was stated later that
Mrs. Mann is the legitimate daughter of
Kasson, and that she is a sister of George
W. Lindy, who is Kasson's legitimate son.
, . There seems to be no doubt , but Mrs.
Mary Mann has a good claim to the Kas
son estate. She isa sister of George Lindy
and was born two years after be saw the
light, Mary Kasson was born in 1852 in
the city of St., Louis. : George W. Lindv,
the other contestant of the will, is in
California. He was born in 1850 and was
given to Thomas Lindy, a fisherman," who
makes his headquarters on an island in
the Missouri River.
There are therefore but two people who
are entitled to the Kasson wealth. 7 The
brother and sister are now trying to oust
the other heirs and .neither knows of the
existence oi the other., Mrs. Kasson will
not be able to claim any of the estate, as
it was acquired after her divorce from
Kasson. '
Sue has tried several husbands, Kasson
being her second, and she deserted him
for another. According to one of the rela
tives Kasson has an illegitimate daughter
living near Brentwood, but she was never
acknowledged by. him and will not be
able to claim any of bis wealth. -*...â

PERJURY IX A Mill III; It CASE.
Trial Judge Asks for a Commutation \
of Death Sentence.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 16.â While de
nying the application for , a writ of , error
cora nobis, although at the same time
holding that such a writ lies in a proper
cause in the State, in the case of Henry
Craemer, sentenced to bs banged for the
murder of Mrs. Mueller and her babe.
Judge Jacobs decreed that in view of rep
utable persons _ tending to .show that Bol
ton Rogers, the State's chief witness, had
manufactured evidence he would "make
the strongest presentation to the Governor
for a commutation of the sentence."
The court cites the fact "that two repu
table witnesses swear that they examined
the miter box (wherein was a small tin
box in which Rogers claims to have found
$200) the day before and that there was no
money there and no small tin box which
contained it."
â¢ Again the court said: - ' If be (Rogers)
committed perjury, as he no doubt did, if
the allegations of the petition are true,
then an indictment for perjury ought to
have been preferred long since. The im
pression made on the mind of this court
is so strong that a grievous wrong may
have been done the prisoner that the
court is willing to make the stioneest pre
sentation to the Governor for a commuta
tion of sentence of this prisoner.",
â¢ Judge Jacobs also held that the de
fendant had the right to force the State
to a trial on the information charging,
him with the murder of - the Mueller
baby.

STOCKTON, Cal., April 16.â The A. P.

to-night, when a ticket to be known as
the non-partisan was to have been placed
in the field. . However, the plans of the
anti-fusionists were all changed when the
Democratic and Republican conventions
adjourned last night for the purpose of
learning what rction the A. P. A. would
take to-night. Now they will not hold
their convention until Monday or Tues
day night, as may be determined by. the
action of their committee to-morrow
evening alter both' the Republicans and
Democrats have placed their -joint ticket
in the field or decided not to luse, as the
conventions may determine.
"The Democrats are solid for fusion,
knowing tbat they have the best of the
argument, but there is dissension in tbe
Republican ranks. In spite of this there
seems to be no doubt but that the better
element in the Republican party will pre
vail and that fusion will carry.
According to the programme, the Re

Interview.
Denied Admission to His Former
Home He Rashly Forced
His Way In.
v STOCKTON, Cal., April W.â Late this
afternoon A. O. Viertong, the well-known
mining man, was shot by his wife, with
whom recently had trouble ,in San
Francisco, which resulted in a divorce.
Viertong has been a successful mining
opertor in recent years and has accumu
lated considerable wealth. Several
months ago he accused his wife of. being
too friendly with a certain well-known
physician of San Francisco and the result
was a family row. She sued for a divorce
on the ground of intemperance and other
causes and a short time ago came here
to live in, the old Viertong residence, a
few miles out from Stockton on the Night
engale road.
Yesterday Viertong came to town and
this morning, in company with a young
man named Griffiths, drove ou: to see his
former wife. She thought he meant mis
chief and would not see bim. This after

Rev. J. R. Compton, Sauta Clara; address, H.
V. Minion, 1). _>Â San Anselmo.
The address of Dr. Minton was one of
the principal ones. His topic was "Chris
tian Genuineness." He began by making
pleasant reference to his personal interest
in Sauta Clara County, in which he had
made his home for several years. He
spoke oi Bayard Taylor as calling their
valley one of the three most beautiful in
the world, ranking it with the ancient
valley of Damascus and the famous plain
of Mexico. He said:
The Y. P. S. C. E. has come to be a recognized
fact and force in the world oi religion. The
approaching convention in San Francisco will
be a great event. The movement has its crit
ics. It needs them; any movement does.
Sometimes popularity kills. Everything of
the kind here must show its stamped ticket or
it will not be allowed to pass. But the law
counts a man au infant till he is 21, and, ac
cording to that, this organization, great as it
is, is only an infant.
Your society emphasizes action, wort, effort,
but only Christian effort. That means a cer
tain kind of motives, aims and principles.
The endeavor without the Christian is like
the galvanized frog, without life. At the bot
tom of Christian genuineness lies genuine
Christianity. "â¢ ;.....). "'.â¢.- '
You have asked one to spoak to you to-night
who is not ia a pastor's position. Froude says
Goi gave us the gospel, but theology came
from tne other direction. If be had confined
his remark to some theology we might let it
pass unchallenged. You believe in Christian
â¢endeavor; but what is Christian endeavor!
Your answer is. A lesson in theology. Sincer
ity is not Christianity ; nor yet is honesty of
purpose or mere unselfishness. Christianity
builds on Christ. Christian endeavor is en
deavor in Christ's name and for Christ's sake.
But who is Christ or what is Christ? .Here
again we fetch up in the midst of theology.
1 heard a young man in San Francisco say,
in an address upon Christian endeavor:
'-Practical Christianity is the only thing tne
world has use for to-day." With no sort of de
preciation of practical good work aud with all
respect for the young man. he was wrong.
The world needs praying' Christians to-day.
It needs tnoughtful Christian*; Christians fed
on Bible and the catechisms, because there
never was a time when â¢ the world was in
greater need ot thoroughly well grounded, in
tellectually and spiritually well -developed
Christian men and women than now.
I want to name three points which, in my
judgment, the endeavor movement must
guard with the utmost care, or its tenure of
Hie and thrift will be uncertain.
loyalty to Holy Scriptures as the word
oi God. This is no dead issue. This is no
fossil bone dun out from the dark caves ot
theology. The Bible is under hot, tierce fire
to-day. Open foe and professing friend are
turning unfriendly forces against the good old
Bible of our fathers. The artilleries of elo
quence, the shafts of satire, the thrusts of
ridicule and the arrows of keen criticism are
being used to storm the fortress of our faith.
Nobody believes more than I do in turning on
all the lights. . Let nothing be hid. Not the
Christian but the coward'turns his back on a
fact which, if he would out face, might dis
prove his religions faith. You cannot study
the Bible too closely. But don't let somebody
cisc put his opinion iv the place oi your own
conclusions. Ii you have not time or brains
to study it thoroughly then take it as it Is.
Scholarship has no magic power to prove the
Bible false. If you do not. believe the Bible
you have no business in the i'hristian En
deavor. The church to which I belong has
more endeavor societies than "any other
church, but all the evangelical churches stand
tocether on this point.
If your association even 'take's" a doubtful
position on this question you are gone. If you
allow your representatives to misrepresent
you on this oointof vital importance, then
the choice will be forced between your organi
zation and the : Bible, and the answer would
be as nnmistabable as it would be quick. You
cannot afford to trifle with the word of God.
It stands unphased in the midst of the battle
smoke and above the fogs of philosophy, and no
work that calls itself Christian can endure
long which does not plant itself solidly upon
what Mr. Gladstone calls the "Impregnable
Rock of Holy Scripture.".
Secondâ Loyalty to the church of God. I
know how you emphasize this, but you cannot
emphasize it too strongly. The church is. the
bride ol Christ. If you want- to -please " the
bridegroom, honor his bride. â¢ Let no rivalry
grow up between your society arid the church.
Value her ordinances, "honor her sacraments
and reverence her holy ministrations.
Thirdâ Loyalty to Christ himself, not as
against loyalty to the Bible and the church,
but through them and, pr means of them.
Christ is not all of Christianity. The sun
shine comes from the sun. but it is not the snn
itself. Christ is the oeuter, tne inspiration
and the goal of Christianity. A certain bridge
in the creat city of Tokio is said to be at the
geographical center of Japan. If you ever
walked along High street in Edinburgh, just
by old St. Giles Cathedral, you have seen set
In the brick pavement a stone in the shape of
a heart, and that is the -'Heart of Midlothian."
Jesus Christ is the heart of Christianity. Let
his heart-beats pulsate in all your endeavors.
You remember the famous definition of a crab,
namely, "a red fish that crawls backward."
It has been said that this was correct, except
that a crab is not red, it is not a fish and does
not crawl backward. Any movement aiming
to raise the moral level of mankind, and tak
ing the name of "Christian," which is not
loyal to the word of God, the church of God
and the son of God is about as much entitled
to the name it bears as that definition is to be
regarded as the true description of a crab.
I do not understand such to be the spirit
and temper of your association. Whenever
you are ready to throw off any one of these
loyalties, thousands of your best friends will
be ready to throw off your society. :
Be clear; be strong I Speak out, live out,
work out your faith. Don* put . yourself, nor
be put. into a false position. Be genuine.
Let everybody know that Christian Endeavor
is filled with the shining warmtn of Christian
genuineness, and with the warming light of
genuine Christianity.

SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 16.â W. A.
Piummer of San Jose, who was arrested a
few days ago by Game Warden Caplatzi
for dynamiting trout in Soquel Creek, in
this county, appeared by counsel Jus
tice Boyle's court at Soquel this afternoon
and pleaded guilty.' He was fined $100,
and the fine was paid with a promptness
that indicated the defendant's desire to
get out of the hands of the law as quietly
as possible. The game warden has held
bis position less than ten days, and
within a week from the date of his ap
pointment had made tbis his first arrest.
CASTAWAYS OF THE WILLAPA.
Picked Up by the Steamer Edith and
Taken io Dyeaâ Great Joy of the
Gold- Hunters.
PORTLAND, Or., April ICâ casta
way passengers of the wrecked steamer
Willapa, who believed that succor would
quickly reach them and that they would
soon be able to continue tteir voyage to
Dyes, have been taken to the latter place
by the steamer Edith, which has just ar
rived back from the trip, says the Even
ing Telegram. According to the story
told by the officers of the Edith there was
never a boat more heartily welcomed by
the stranded gold-hunters than the Edith
when she put in an appearance at Bella.
Bella. It was not so much the discom
forts which the men were undergoing â
for they were prepared to face hardships
in the wilds of AlasKa, and they ' were
plentifully supplied with provisions and
stores from the wrecked steamer â but
every day which they were compelled to
stay there was regarded as a day lost out
of the all-too-short season during wbich
they could accumulate the golden nug
gets.
While they were compelled to wait for
nearly two weeks in enforced idleness
gold-seekers who left the Sound lone after
, the Willapa's passengers were landed at
Dyea and had already begun the long
journey over the divide to the pint
waters of the "Yukon, down which they
could float to the rich gold fields in the
vicinity of Circle City. The days were not
all of idleness, however, for the men were
busied during the earlier period of their
imprisonment in saving stores, baggage
and in fact anything from the steamer
which was not below water.
The stories of the looting of the wreck
and its subsequent breaking up by the
waves are said to be gross exaggerations.
The bull of the steamer is still said to be
in comparatively good condition, and it
will be an easy matter to save her machin
ery with modern wrecking appliances.
She is not yet broken, and ber engines
and boilers are still in position. The
miners who were on board saved nearly
if not all their personal effects, including
provisions and cooking and camp utensils,
so that but for the loss of ten days or so
they will be enabled to strike the trail in
as good condition as their more fortunate
brothers who have not suffered the bard
ships of shipwreck at the outset of their
undertaking.
The fifty passengere who were taken on
board the steamer Edith- were carried
straight through to Dyea, their original
destination. The total Joss to the Willapa
and cargo, provided there is no effort
made to wreck her by the insurance com
panies, is estimated at $00,000, with an in
surance of $23,000.
BELIEVES THE SAMARIA LOST.
Story of Ccptain Dermot of the Barkentine
Portion aâ The Vessel He Saw in
a Storm.
PORTLAND, Or., April There is a
bare possibility that Captain Thomas Der
mot of the barkentine Portland, now load
ing lumber in port, caught a last glance of
tbe missing bark Samaria. If such was
the vessel sighted by the Portland, then,
as Captain Dermot states it, he has grave
fears that the Samaria never rode out the
storm, Â.'
"It was on the afternoon of Friday last,
and we were some 3 deg. off the coast and
bucking into the. worst storm and sea 1
have ever encountered in tbe Pacific
Ocean. Such was the force of the hurri
cane that the atmosphere was filled with
the flying spume, making it a hard matter
to sec two chips' lengths ahead of the
Portland. â¢ â¢ ' â¢ â â â "â â¢
'Suddenly the, horizon cleared to the
northwest and we plainly made out a
vessel of about the size and build of the
Samaria. but so far distant as to be unable
to discern any signals had she been flying
them. ' The vessel was laboring fearfully
in the tremendous sea running; Every
thing forward appeared a-wreck. her bead
sails being gone and the craft having
broached to.
"A moment later the flying mist shut
down again thick, and the vessel was lost
to sight. I cannot say it was tbe Samaria,
but as I understand it that vessel would
have been near that position at the time.
If it was the Samaria, then, with her dead
weight cargo of coal and in her partially
dismantled condition, I have little hope of
her ever being beard from again."
FATAL BATHXEAR REDWOOD.
An Explanation of the Death of Watch
man Jllelchior Duerst.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., April ICâ The
particulars surrounding the death of
Melchior Duerst, the watchman at Sears
ville Lake who was found dead at the foot
of the dam .yesterday afternoon, were
learned to-day. The dam, over which a
large stream of waterds flowing, is unfin
ished, it being the intention of the Spring
Valley Water Company to increase its
height. In its present condition . tbe
water, in running over the top. strides on
an, abutment, causing- the spra^to be
thrown high into the air, and thence run
ning off and into the â¢ stream some forty
feet below. v 7 *;
Duerst had been in tbe habit of utilizing
tbis spray for a shower batb, standing on
the edge, of, the dam and allowing tbe
spray to come on to him. When be did
not put in an appearance 'Wednesday
night the officials of the water company
were notified. *â â  Search was' made, and his
clothes were' discovered on tbe top of the
dam. The hole at its foot .was dragged
and the- body 'found. He probably lost
his footing and fell, for it is not thought
he would take his own life. He leaves a
widow and two children.-- "- - .%â¢;
He was a member of the Ancient Order

St. II El. EX A TO CORPORATE.
Property- Owners Groaning Under Ex
cessive Taxation.
ST. HELENA, Cal, April 16.â At the
last session of the Board of Town Trus
tees, a largely signed petition was handed
in by the Town Clerk requesting the dis
continuance of the town as a corporation.
Many citizens were present, but Mayor
Bingham dampened their enthusiasm by
referring the petition to a board of exam
iners, composed of Trustees Hnnser,
Chiles and York. The petition will be
duly j considered and acted upon next
Wednesday night.
The reasons for disincorporate are the
excessive taxes, new licenses, recent or
dinances, and especially the one relating
to tne paring of Main street, the principal
thoroughfare. This, considering the hard
times, is deemed unwarranted. It would
nearly bankrupt property-owners along
the thoroughfare, as the entire cost would
fall on them.
The petition to disincorporate and the
Board of Trade movement coming at the
same time place things in a queer predic
ament. It. ls doubtful' whether enough
strength can be brought to bear on the
move to disincorporate to adorn it. >

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 17, 1897.
EDITOR SEHORN
MAY BE PARDONED
Very Romantic .Story of
Why He Killed Drug
gist Putnam.
To Protect the Sacred Honor
of a Lady He Pledged
His Word.
Evidence Before Governor Budd
to Prove the Taleâ Com
promising Latter.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. April 16.â 1t is
claimed that within a few days evidence
will be laid before Governor Budd which
may induce bim to grant a pardon to Dr.
W. A. Seborn, ; editor of the Willows
Gazette, who, something oyer a year ago,
killed .1. E.'Putnam, a druggist .of Wil
lows, and was sentenced to a term of
eight years in the State prison, the sen
tence of the Superior Court having been
lately affirmed by the Supreme Court of
the State.
Should the claims made be proved true
it will exemplify tbat Editor Seborn is a
man of honor who, rather than violate his
plighted word to a lady, preferred to en
dure the ignominy of the State prison.
Briefly the story is as follows: A
wealthy young lady of Colusa County,
who is well known in swell society circles
and whom Seborn bad been acquainted
with from her infancy, while visiting in
Sacramento received, it is claimed, the
following insulting letter from Putnam :
Willow?, Aug. 17, 1894. "
My Learnt Friend: I will be down Sunday on
my way to the State Convention. Now, my
dear friend, I want you to go down to the city
with me Monday. All the other delegates will
go on to the city on Sunday, so no one will see
us. Do not say you will not go, as we can have
a good time and no one will ever know it. li
you cannot go wire me Saturday using the fol
lowing words, "It is off," and do not sign any
name. P.
In her grief and anger she, after pledg
ing Seborn to eternal secrecy, gave him
tbe letter and in subsequent editorials
from his pen he frequently used the
words, "It is off." This gave Putnam to
understand that the letter was in his pos
session, and it is claimed that one evening
Putnam sprang into the editor's sanctum
and, presenting a pistol at bis head, de
manded the epistle. It is claimed that
Sehorn remonstrated with him until
catching him off bis guard he drew bis
own pistol and drove the druggist from
the room, but as he left be is claimed to
have said, "I'll kill yon on sight."
All of tnis story Seborn has, in honor
to bis plighted word, withheld, but now
that no other legal hope remains to keep
the prison doors from closing on him, the
young lady bas demanded that the whole
story be presented to the Governor as a
proof that the killing was an act of self
defense. . : - .' â

TACOMA DEADFALLS RAIDED.
The City Jail Crowded as a Result of
Commissioner Teats' "Slumming"
Expedition..
TACOMA, Wash., April 16.â Tacoma's
City Jail is jammed full this morning of
gamblers, 'fallen women and their male
companions. Chief of Police Hoge getting
a tin last night of the fact that Civil Ser
vice ; Commissioner Teats was going to lay
formal charges of neglect, of duty and
incompetence against him, resolved lo
checkmate this if possible by rounding up
all offenders against the law. The police
were all called in and a general raid made
on the gambling-houses and places of dis
repute. A number of tbe bouses got
wind of the new move and the inmates
escaped arrest by closing before the police
arrived.**
Teats charges that Hoge is Incompetent
and unpractical, without thoughts and
ideas and without the executive ability to
carry them into force even if he had them,
and that he is knowingly permitting
young girls to remain in houses of ill
fame and allows messenger-boys to fre
quent such places.
Hoge announced after' the arrests were
made that in future be would compel all
the saloons to remain closed on Sundays.
He says if the people want the laws en
forced he will enforce them. In thia way
be hopes to escape censure and probable
dismissal by the Civil Service Commission.

Interesting Paper Read Before the Friday
Morning Club.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 16.â The
BUD]ect at the Friday Morning Club this
forenoon was "Misdirected Energy." Mrs.
C. E. Day read a very interesting paper on
"Misdirected Energy in .the Church," in
which she spoke of the bazaars, fairs, etc.,
being mistaken for favors to the church.
She stated that the same amount of money
given would help much more than by oc
cupying so much time and trouble in ar

A VISIT TO THE
WOOTTON RANCH
Sanders, Court and Jury
Have a Tedious
Journey.
Witness , Rohloff Contradic s
One of His Former
. Statements.
Ruling of the Supreme Court With
Which Judge Carroll Cook Â
Disagrees.
FRESNO, Cal., April 16.â The jury
which is. trying Professor W. A. Senders
on a charge of forgery returned at mid
night last night from a visit to the Woot
ton ranch, which is situated in the foot
hills forty miles east of this city. Judge
Carroll Cook and the entire court, includ
ing the defendant, accompanied the. jury.
The day was very warm, and the long ride
was a very disagreeable one.
To-day the introduction of testimony
began. Charles Rohloff, who . was work
ing on the ranch at the time of Wootton's
disappearance, and who saw the wealthy
rancher drive away with Sanders on the
afternoon of February 1, 1894, was on the
stand the entire day.
The most important feature of the pro
ceedings of the day was the statement of
Judge Carroll Cook that in bis opinion
the introduction oi all matters not bear
ing directly upon the forgery charge
should not be permitted to go before the
jury.
But in the appeal taken to the Supreme
Court by the defendant, when he secured
a new trial, that tribunal held that testi
mony connecting Sanders with Wootton's
disappearance was admissible, in that it
tended to corroborate the evidence show
ing that the signature of Wootton's name
to the $1,00 draft could not be genuine.
Judge Cook said that no matter what
his own opinion might be he would have
to recognize the rulings of the Supreme
Court as the law in the case, and, there
fore, allow the testimony which the de
fense claimed was extraneous. The court
stated tbat be wanted the record to show
that he permitted the testimony on this
ground, as bis own views did not conform
with those of the Supreme Judges.
Mr. Short objected to the introduction
of the indirect testimony shortly after
Rohloff was placed upon the stand, as At
torney Hinds for the prosecution immedi
ately began questioning the witness re
garding Wootton's disappearance trom
the ranch on February 1, 1894. '
Attorney Short has at all the trials
strongly maintained that such evidence
was intended to prove Sanders guilty of
murder and was not relevant to the for
gery charge. '-^IPI
The . disagreement of Judge Cook's
opinion. with tho j views of the Supreme
Courtis interesting, as the Judge is. recog
nized a3 one- of the best authorities on
criminal law in the State. â 
Witness Rohloff made a change in his
testimony from that he gave at the last,
trial. He to-day cont.adicted the former
assertion that on his visit to the ranch the
week before he tookWootton away Sanders
started home in the afternoon. 'To-day
the witness said it wa3 in the morning.
This is important, as. the, defense have
heretofore agreed that the witnesses who
saw Sanders driving alone on February 1,
presumably after be had hidden Woot
ton's body, were mistaken as to dates.
SAUSALITO FIRE TROUBLES.
Citizens. State That. They Will Start a
Fire Department of Their Own
tor Protection.
SAUSALITO, Cal., April 16.â Trouble
is brewing between the citizens of Sausa
lito who are taking an interest in fire ap
paratus and the regular members of the
Sausalito Fire Department. At a mass
meeting of residents. held some time since
it was left to J. 'X. Harmes to appoint a
committee of five to secure apparatus to
use in case of lire. Mr. Harmes appointed
the following gentlemen, together with
himself, on the committee: J. M. Kil
garif, H. A. Cobb, Thomas Frost, Fred
Raiscb.
Information in regard to the expenditure
of town money for fire apparatus has been
obtained and a breezy little explanation
is said to follow. The citizens' committee
has said that they intend to start a fire
department of their own and act inde
pendently of the regular department.
"After every fire in Sausalito." said
President Sylva of the Sausalito Fire De
partment to-day, "this same sort of rum
pus is raised and never amounts to any
thing. The hill people are not the ones
who take off their coats and fight the
fires. They are not here in the daytime,
and if a fire broke out then they would not
be here to light it. All this talk won't
amount to anything,"
K The other aide tells a different story.
Tbey say that over $20,000 has been ex
pended for fire protection and the town is
sadly in need of proper apparatus. They
intend to get at the bottom of tbe matter.
SAUSALITO'S NEW SCHEME.
The Town's Prisoners to Be Set at Work
Repairing, Grading and Cleaning
the Roads.
SAUSALITO, Cal, April 16.â Prisoners
arrested in Sausalito for various offenses
may be compelled to spend their time
.fixing up the streets if the suggestions
made go into effect. The tough Sunday
picnicker, who inpulges too freely in beer
and is put in the lockup to spend the
.night, may find that all is not fine.
It is the purpose to enforce the town
ordinance, which- provides that the Town
Marshal may make the prisoners under
his care labor for eight hours on the roads
or other public property for the benefit of
the town. 'â ..-â  . =7^.
The argument in favor of; tbe proposi
tion is tbat tbere is much work that could
be done on the. streets, such ns cleaning,
grading or repairing, which the town at
present does not feel able to appropriate
money to have accomplished, and the
toughs who are taken in of a Sunday can
ba set to work on Monday to recompense
the town for what it expends in furnish
ing them meals. That the Trustees will
instruct the Town Marshal tojdo this there
is little doubt. -

LATE TRAINS FROM MARIN.
North Pacific Coast Railroad Directors
Resolve to Run Extra Trips
at N.ght.
MILL VALLEY, Cal.. April 16.â The
board of directors of the North Pacific
Coast Railroad have decided to. run late
trains and boats from | San Rafael, Mill
Valley and Sausalito to San Francisco, ar
riving in the latter place at 11:15 p. m.
J. B. Stetson, president of the North
Pacific Coast Railroad, said this evening
that the trains would be run providing tbe
Railroad Commissioners do not comply
with the request of James McCne of Corte
Madera, who has petitioned them to.com
pel the railroad to reduce its fares in
Marin County.
The people of Marin County have never
enjoyed a night service to San Francisco,
and the people of Mill Valley are -spe
cially fortunate. . By the new order of
things Mill Valley will not only sÂ«cure
late trains to San Francisco but will secure
a train direct to its station three nights
a week from the metropolis at 11:30 o'clock.
At the present time this trip does not run
to Mill Valley, but connections are made
with a bus at Alto station, one mile dis
tant from Mill Valley. Ââ¢ 5 ,-â¢ y

Chief Engineer Fred T. Perris, all of the
Southern California Railway, and General
Solicitor C. N. Sterry of the Atlantic and
Pacific, arrived in the city last night by
special car. . 7, '.
Tbis is Mr. Nevin's first official trip
over the road of which he became general
manager a few weeks ago, and be is ac
cordingly' making a very thorough in
spection of the entire line and of the
country tributary to it. .
One of the most* important improve
ments which it is proposed to inaugurate
in the near future is the reduction of the
heavy grades on the surf line between
this city and Los Angeles. -The" heaviest
of these grades is tbe one at Soledad Hill,
eighteen miles north of this city. To re
duce this grade would require eit ler a
tunnel or several miles of new road and
a consequent expenditure of many
thousand dollars. .7,.- 77
Engineer Perris and Mr. Nevin were
asked concerning this proposed improve
ment this morning, but neither cared to
talk- about it at this time.
-Several important matters are on the
tapis," said Mr. Nevin, "but it would not
do tor me to talk at present."
To-day was spent in a general inspec
tion ot the property of the road in this
city and vicinity, the wharves and ter
minal facilities. To-morrow morning the
party leaves for Fallbrook and up the
Temecula Canyon, thence 'to EÂ«condido,
returning - to Los Angeles on Monday.
I General Manager Nevin said that no cx
i tensions of the Southern California would
i be mane at present, but that after the con
| solidation of the Southern California with
j the Atlantic and Pacific, which he thought
! would take place in a few weeks, some
j thing of tbe kind might take place.

terest by tbe students of the two universi
ties. In the morning the cbess came
comes off at the Mark Hopkins institute
of Art. In the afternoon the second of a
series of three baseball games will be
played in Central Park. â¢
A week ago Stanford won at baseball by
a score of 14 to 13. The Stanford team
will be made up as it was at that time.
Berkeley has made some changes at dif
ferent points which were found to be
weak. Whether the move was a wise one
can be determined only by the game itself.
In order to keep the team in good trim,
Eowin James '98, manager of the Sinn
ford ball-tossers, arranged for a game with
a team from Santa Clara College last
Wednesday. Stanford won by the easy
score of 10 to 3. Since then practice has
been light and the men are now in fine
shape for anotber game.
Coach King has eased up on the track
men. aud from - now on no more exercise
will be given the sprinters than is neces
sary to keep them in first-class condition.
With training diet and judicious exercise
all the Stanford men should enter tbe
field day, April 24, prepared to do their
best.
- Charles Dole and Edward Morgan are
the only men at present who are not in
the best of shape. Dole has been bothered
with a weak knee, which prevents prac
tice in the pole vault and running broad
jump; and Morgan has been suffering
irom a cold of late,'>ut is gmduaily wear
ing it out. Brady. Burnett, '00 and Ev.ins
Holbrook, '97, are running in good shape.
Burnett will enter in the mile and hall
mile' runs, and Holbrook will try for a
place in the sprints.
The recent field day held at Berkeley
confirms the belief that Stanford and their
friendly rivals across the bay would have
a hard time breaking the tie of last year
when they meet at the next field day.
The changes in the Berkeley team will be
Kaarsburg for permanent pitcher and the
substitution of Kuster for .McLaren. The
nine, with the chances' noted, will be
made up *â¢> follows: Pitcher,- Kaarnbur;;
catcher, Wheeler; first base, Hennesey;;
second base, Elsion; third p base,: Krug ;
shortstop. Kuster; left field, Foster; cen
ter field, living; right field, Sykes. .

NEW TO-DAY
SALTâ PISH
Not wise, maybe, to talk about such common subjects as these, but they go
together well, either end foremost. Probably half the psopie that use salt do not
know where it comes from nor what country supplies it. Not all the salt that is
branded "Liverpool" or comes in foreign-looking sacks is brought from that market.
You can buy salt in "Liverpool" sacks that "is only tit to be trodden under feet of
men." Reno, Nev., produces some of the strongest and whitest salt found in the
world, but it did not SAVE the State from a late tribulation. H-- â '".-

Along the Missouri and the Mississippi
in these days everything goes.
It is a mig-ty good town along the
Mississippi that can keep its head above
water in these days.
From the way tne Levantine drama is
being played out it is clear that good act
ing can never be exnected from a concert
company.
New York is to have a new custom
house, Philadelphia a new mint, Chicago

Senator Heitfeid of Idaho is quoted as
saying to a Washington reporter that
while he Is pleased with the Eastern
cities be has seen, and particularly so
with Washington, ho" still "considers San
Francisco to be the greatest of American
cities. The Senator, being a Populist,
can hardly be called level-headed in poli
tics, but there can be no doubt that he is
one of the bast judges of towns in this
country.
It has been proposed that the Elkins
bill, providing differential duties on goods
imported in American ships, shall be
made part of the Dingley tariff, and tbe
proposition has found a good deal of sup
port in the East. The two measures are
indeed closely related. to one another, and
yet it will hardly be worth while to join
th- m at the risk of delaying and possibly
endangering the tariff. Let us take one
step at a time.
According to the programmes that have
been arranged so far the processions to be
held in New York on the dedication of the
Crapt monument and in London in cele

parade occasions. The New York display
will be much larger than the one in Lon
don, but it will not be so brilliant. The
British pageant will hardly occupy more
than an hour in passing a given point, but
the American procession will require more
than double that time.
A FAIR PROSPECT.
The efforts of The Call and the commercial and Industrial bodies of the City to
bring about a prompt beginning of the construction of the Federal building have not
been in vain. Our Congressmen have cordially seconded the movement here, and
progress has been made.
In an interview witn the Washington correspondent of The Call on Thursday
evening, Congressman Loud, in speaking of nis efforts to advance the business, said:
"I believe that Secretary Spaulding will cause the work of the engineers to bo
edited, and you may say to our people that at last there is a fair prospect of
commencing tho construction of the building."
There is just enough of encouragement in that promise to impel us to keep up the
aeitation. lly persistent endeavor we have reached the point from which wo can see
fair prospects, but realization is still some way ahead. We must continue to support
vigorously at home the work that is being done by our representatives at Washington.
The tactics which have carried us thus far are those we must employ steadfastly until
success is achieved.
Congressman Loud has taken up tho work with energy and zeal. Senator Perkins
and other members of the California delegation in Congress should cordially second
his efforts. The administration is known to be favorable to everything which tends to
promote the welfare of the country and provide work for the people. At the present
time New York is expecting a new custom-bouse, Chicago a new postoffice and Phila
delphia a new mint. San Francisco has claims prior to all of these.
According to reports from Washington, it is the intention of the Secretary in
charge of the work to hasten as much as possible the tests now being made of the site,
and as soon as a favorable report is made to advertise for bids for the construction of
the building. We in thi* City may not be able to do anything more just now to for
ward the movement, but we can let Mr. Loud know we appreciate his efforts, and Sec
retary Spaulding that we count on his energies. x .'. r . .
In the meantime public interest in the work should not flag for a day. It was
only by the agitation in San Francisco that the subject was forced .upon the considera
tion of the officials, and it is only by a continued earnestness and activity here that
the prospects now so fair can be brought to a speedy realization.
FIGHTING PROTECTION.
The free-traders have a strong lobby at
Washington and are fighting the Dingley
tariff with tooth and nail. Tbe disasters
of the past four years, the deficit of the
Wilson tariff, the discredit of the Cleve
land administration and the increase in
the public debt have had no effect upon
the minds ol importers greedy for foreign
trade or doctrinaires wise in tbeir own
conceit They are as ardent to defeat
protection to-day as they were when tbey
went about declaring the McKinley tariff
to be a robbery and a fraud.
If the Senate were strongly Republican
we need have no fear of these men. Their
opposition would serve only to give new
zest to the debates in Congress and add
variety to the news of the day. Unfor
tunately the Senate is not under Republi
can control. The majority in favor of the
new tariff is not expected to exceed two
or three m-n. It may be limited to one.
The. free-tiaders therefore have a /rood
chance to force some sort of compromise
on genuine protectionists, and uniess the
Republicans in the Senate are not only
vigilant and resolute but thoroughly
united there is danger that some impor
tant interest of the country may have to
be sacrificed to the importers in order to
secure protection to the rest.
Fortunately the Republican members of
the Finance Committee are statesmen in
whom the people can have confidence.
Senators Morrill, Allison, Piatt of Con
necticut, Wolcott, Aldrich and Jones are
men of genuine Americanism. They have
thoroughly studied the subject of tariffs
in relation to industry and revenue and
are aware that protection can ba made
perfect only by being made universal.
They will undoubtedly uphold the bill
substantially as it came from the House
or revise it only for the purpose of mak
ing it more effectively and comprehen
sively protective than at present.
The interests of . California in the bill
are many. Some of them are inter-sts al
most peculiar to this State. We must be
watchful therefore to see that they are
properly supported. We need all the in
dustries we can get in California in order
to provide work for our workingmen. We
have not one which we can afford to leave
exposed to the competition ol cheap-labor
countries. We can tale no chances at
this juncture on an issue of this Kind. We
need not believe all the stories sent out
by the free-trade correspondents at Wash
ington ol the intention of Senators to re
duce the rates fixed by the Hour., but
nevertheless we must not ignore the work
the importers are doing. It is imperative
to keep a close watch on the enemy and be
prepared to baffle his efforts at every turn.
LOWER INTEREST RATES.
One of the notable features of the finan
cial situation is the success which bas
been attained by some of tbe great corpo
rations of the East in refunding their
debts at much lower rates of interest than
they have bsen paying heretofore. Prom
inent among these is the Lake Shore
road, which is reported to have arranged
to pay off its old mortgage of about
$45,000,000, drawing 7 per cent Interest,
by negotiating a new loan at 3j/_ per cent.
Other railway lines are expected to make
equally good terms, and it is believed tbat
the interest charge on all our railroads
will be materially diminished in the near
future.
From this diminution in rates of inter
est great results are expected, ana it is
certain that far-reaching effects will be
felt in the business world. Some railway
shareholders are said to believe that the
lower charges for * interest will allow
larger dividends and consequently tbat
the value of railway securities will in
crease. Others are inclined to the opinion
that the result will be lower rates of
freights and fares rather than larger divi
dends, and that the benefits of the les
sened interest charges will be for the
public and not exclusively for railway
shareholders. Among those who hold the
latter belief -is George E.Roberts of the
Chicago Herald who in reviewing the
situation saya:
The fact is that the acceptance of lower re
turns on railway bonds means logically lower
returns on railway stocks. It means that cap
ital will give us our transportation hereafter
ior much less compensation tliau formerly.
And it must be remembered that along with
this acceptance of lower returns on the capital
employed has come, and is coming, an enor
mous reduction in the amount of capital re
quired to build and equip and operate a rail
way for a given amount of transportation.
The two facts together are of much signifi
cance. They ". have already taken hall the
value out ot the Eastern farm lands and trans
ferred it to lana west of Chicago. The further
reduction In sight means that the Western
farm Is to be moved yet nearer to its custom
ers, and that lis products will cost the con
sumer less, and leave them more to spend on
other comforts.
If this view of tbe drift of things is , the
correct one it Is clear that California is
going to reap a large share of the coining
benefits. Reduced rates of transportation
wbich will make us nearer to the Eastern
market will allow us larger opportunities
to profit by that market. Moreover, when
interest rates fall in the East there will be
greater inducements for capital to come to
California. ,We J can* look j forward to an
increased development of our resources as
well as to better markets for those already
developed, and in short may expect a gen
eral improvement in all departments cf
our trade and industry.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL- 17. 1897.
TOO MUCH GROVER.
If some of our most esteemed Eastern
contemporaries have not wholly lost their
wits there is a possibility t .at Cleveland
will bob up serenely from his obscurity
and come in with a third-term boom to
contest with Bryan the Democratic nom
ination for the Presidency in 1900. This
seems like a fable surpassing that of the
phenix, but all th- same it is a tale that
is told with a gravity befitting matters of
political importance, and evidencs is of
fered to confirm it. â ;':. -'â¢'
There seems in fact to be a Cleveland
( party In the East, made up indeed of
: mugwumps and cuckoos, but still a party
! with a pull strong enough to flap one
â  wing of the Democratic bird, and there
lore capable to some extent of directing
J its course. This party no leader save
i Grover, and as it is not content to remain
unnoted and unknown, it perforce puts
i Grover to the front once more in order
j that DPOple seeing him revived and seem
l ingly vigorous may take account also of
those behind him and reckon them among
! the political factors of the country.
A certain sleek and well-fed set of gen
tlemen belonging to this party proposes to
i give banquet in New York toward the
i close of this month at which will be gath-
I ered a- guests of honor in addition to Mr.
! Cleveland such eminent Groverites as
j John G. Carlisle, William L. Wilson. Wil
i liam D. Bynum, E. Ellery Anderson and
| Charles 8. Fairchild. By way of convinc
ing the country that Cleveland is not a
â  back number and an out of date chromo
he has been invited to spetk on "Present
: Problems,'' and the company will need no
j cuckoo clock to warn them wben to ap-
I plaud.
Prior to the banquet there is to be a two
j days' conference, ostensibly for the pur
'< pose of devising a means of reorganizing
. the Democratic party. It is this confer
i ence.even more than the banquet which
j bas disturbed the East with fears of a
| political resurrection of Grover. One of
I the leading papers of Philadelphia sug
gests directly that the scheme is intended
"to boom Mr. Cleveland for still another
. term." It points out that there is scarcely
'â  a man expected at the banquet or the con
ference wo is not a Cleveland worshiper.
Many of them are known to have favored
his renoniination iaut year. "What is
â  more natural." it asks, "under these cir-
I cumstances than tbat. they should still
desire him as a candidate ?"
From all of which it is evident that
I while we may have seen the last of
. Grover we have not heard the last of him
jby any means. He is destined to, be the
phenix of politics and will probably be
rising and rearising for a generation to
come. The country at large of course will
be little disturbed by these reappearances
of the phantom bird, but to poor old
Democracy it will seem Ike an attendant
I vulture forever waiting to devour its re
mains. ,

Ukiah, attracting many people now.
"A peculiar thing about the cold spring
there," said he, "is that yon can take a glass
of the mineral water from it, sque< zs a little
lemon juice Into lt and add a little sugar, and
you have an excellent glass of lemon ads.
"The managers of the flih hatchery
on the Russian River, a mile south of Ukiah,
permit tourists to fish on the extensive
grounds. There are many fish, and with a
good hook and line any one can have line
sport.
"A two hours' ride, too, takes one to Blue
Lake, where there Is fine boating, fishing and
swimming, and near by there is different kinds
of hunting.
"Sixty miles north of Ukiah. among the
birch and redwoods, there are bears to be seen
In plenty and there is an abundance of salmon
and trout. In this vicinity, too, there is coal
and strong indications of coal oil. The Indian
rancheria there is kept by Government and
receives the best of care.
"Along the roads are variegated flowers,
Manzanita and other shrubs and lofty red
woods. there are many picturesque trails also.
Not far away is Fort Uragg, from which a
steamer runs to San Francisco.
"As to the wool, hops and- beef interests of
Mendocino, not to apeak of the vast lumbering
resources, they arc all looking better. The
people all believe that more prosperous times
are ahead. They, ate very well satisfied with
the indications for the county which has
such a wealth of resources."

The appearance of The Call to-morrow will be watched for with interest by people whose
attention to passing literature extends farther than a mere perusal of It for the sake of enter

special features from the East, and who hope to attract the fleeting fancy by bright colors,
after the manner of South-sea Island traders
tendering gaudy beads to savages.
The Call is convinced that good, sensible
texts, with appropriate Illustrations, selected
and arrange! with reasonable discrimination,
will please the right class of people better
than sensationalism, gaudiness or sharp wit

recommendation of Californian production,

A NEW SYSTEM OF NAVAL TACTICS.
A system of naval tactics has been recently proposed by Commander McCalla and offered to
the Secretary ol the Navy for the use of the Government. It is the first complete system Dre
â â  pared for the use of the powerful modern bat
tle-ships, cruisers and torpedo-boats, and is
based entirely upon the principles universally
adopted tor the organization and movements
of armies. .-
The arrangement of four ships which consti
tute a squadron, ana which is the "tactical
unit" of the fleet, Is believed to be new in
princinle, and is the formation by which mod
ern ships can be most easily handled and the
maneuvers of fleets most successfully carried
DUt.
The system consists of complete movements
lor a squadron of four ships of any kind, of
movements for fleets of two, three ana of four
squadrons; of a series of formations for battle,
with the numerous changes nnd combinations
which can be made from the four primary
manuevers. It also embraces the deployments
\aa assembling-: of cruisers used, like cavalry
in an army, to cover the advance of the main
body, represented by the battle-ships, armored
cruisers and monitors constituting the line of
â battle. -;ipy r^-7'-7--T
This initial formation lor cruising ii the one generally recommended by military authori
ties for the advance of an army where there is no natural or artificial protection for its flanks;
I. c., the subdivisions are echeloned from the center with the reserve in rear and equally dis
tant from both flanks. This initial or cruising formation is the one from which the tactical
units can be most quickly deployed Into battle formations to meet the attack of an enemy who
may approach from any direction; the conditions at' sea' corresponding- to the situation on
land when an army is without protection for iv flanks and may have to meet an enemy ad
vancing from any point of the compass. ' X ' j 7- ; 7
The system of hcilcs has been favorably reported on by the prosldent and staff of the War
College and recommenaed for a practical trial. Tbe battle formations do not differ from
these in vogue in ancient times when galleys were used in war, but during the sail period
these formations fell into disuse from the difficulties experienced in handling large fleets
which depended upon the wind, for motive cower.
j In view of the necessity for all naval officers to make a close study of naval tactics, sadly
shown by the collision bstween the Victoria and Camperdown In 1893, a "naval tactical
game" was prepared and submitted to the Navy Department; to be used to illustrate the possi
bilities of the system cf naval tactics proposed by the author, and thir tactical game has been
used at the War College.
There is also a complete set of signals for the tactical use of the fleet, embraced between
the numbers 0 and 99. thus requiring but one or two flags to make a signal.
In the squadron ships Nos. 2, 3 and 4. are equally distant from No. 1, or are on the arc of a
circle of which the flagship is the center. This formation is thus a geometrical one a neces
sity in any system of tactics. ' --k.-a.
The squadrons of a fleet are arranged upon the same principles as the ships of a squadron
are equally distant trom the commander-in-chief and are separated from each otner by a
distance equal to the length of the line occupied by the four ships of a squadron when
abreast of each other. '____ ' - ' â"*â

IF THE LIZZIE
PRIEN GOT IN
Why Shouldn't the Samaria
Be Heard of Before
Long?
Was Twenty Days From Tacoma
and Did Not Sight the
Samaria.
Good FriJay Was Obssrved as a
Ho id ay on All the British
Merchantmen.
One of the overdue fleet got in from the
Sound yesterday. The little schooner
Lizzie Prien made an unusually long run
of twenty days from Tacoma.
Her owners had piven her up as lost and
were much surprised to learn that she was
passing through the Golden Gate. When
she reached the Golden Gate Lumber
Company's wharf in Oakland Creek no
one was more surprised than the manager
of the concern. The little boat did not
engage a tug, but with a fresh breeze
failed up tho bay and making the mouth
of the creek sailed in and the breeze hold
ing good made her landing without assist
ance. "We never expected to see the ves
sel again," said George Fisher, manager of
the company. "She was an unusually
long time out, and judging from the re
ports of the weather and the hard times
that other vessels had encountered we
naturally feared the worst. However,
all's well that ends well, and ihe Lizzie
Prien is safe and sound in Oakland
Creek."
"The Lizzie Prien sailed from Tacoma
twenty days ago," said Captain Anderson
yesterday, "while the Samaria left a week
ahead of ns. The first day out we got it
hot and heavy, nnd from that on it was a
succession of sharp gales and calms. We
passed no wreckage and saw no vessels in
the distance. We passed an old spar, but
it had been so long in the water that we
did not pay any attention to it. If the
Samaria did* not go down during the seven
days prior to. our sailing date, she cer
tainly did not founder in the storms we
encountered."
If the captain of the Rufus E. tVood is
correct in bis surmises, then tbe last time
the Samaria was seen was on April 2. In
that event Captain Anderson is willing to
swear tbat she is still afloat, as alter that
date there was no storm s-utlicient to sink
a longboat. The owners of the missing
vessel have nothing to say about the
I matter, and will not express an opinion
I until alter the return of the revenue-cutter
1 Rush. â¢ *:;" '7* "
Yesterday was practically a Sunday on
j the water front. Being Good Friday, not
one of the British ships was at work and
! ail the men were uptown haviug a good
' time. The American ships kept right on,
â  however, and on one side of the Pacific
i street wharf might be seen the Australia
I loading and unloading prior to her de
parture for Hawaii next Tuesday, while
on the other side of the dock was the
Monowai, with not a dozen men aboard,
lying in idleness at her moorings. Nearly ,
all the British fleet bad their flags at half
mast, but, among the American mercan
tile marine no. notice was taken of the
day.
Chief Officer R. T. Lawless of t'e Aus
tralia rati across an old acquaintance in
Honolulu last voyage. He was walking
along the main street when he saw a man
of-warsman approaching whom he thought
he knew. After a second look be ex
claimed, "Hello, Somerf, old man, bow
â¢ are you?" The sailor stopped in aston
ishment and then managed to say, "Wny,
i Lawless, is thai you?" Just thirty-one
' years ago Lawless was a boy aboard the
, old schoolship Sabine and he and Somers
j were mates. The latter used to play the
organ on Sundays, and many a time the
two sailors sang to ihe same accompani-
m ent. Lawless served through the last
j year of the war and then joined the mer
| chant marine. Somers stayed in the navy
1 and is now gunner on the Marion, sta
! tioned at Honolulu.
General Manager Pryor of the Piper,
Aden, Goodall Company was determined
to see just how matters were under water
in re card to the wieckage of the steamer
Sunol yesterday, so he went down in a
diving suit. Strange to say, he did not re
turn empty-handed, but" brought back
with him the nickel-in-the-slot machine,

nickels. Pryor is now satisfied that his
silver mine is a paving one and the work
of exploring it will continue. He made
bis way over lead bars and poked around
until he had a fair knowledge of the sur
roundings. Then a big Sacramento River
salmon took a look at the diver and Pryor
save a frantic pull at the rope to be hauled
on deck aeain. He thoueht it was a shark.
Diver Dolpb and the crew of the
schooner tried their best to persuade Mr.
Pryor from making the descent; but he
persisted, and made a success of the
venture. In talking about the matter
yesterday, Mr. Pryor said that the work
of recovering the remainder of tbe bullion
would be slow, as it was incumbered with
wreckage. According to him, the greater
part of tne bullion will be recovered nnd
nearly all the steamer's fixtures. Since
Pryor has taken char c of the work of
salving the wreck remarkable progress has
been made. Fully $30,000 worth of bul
lion hat been recovered and the good work
still goe* on. ]Wjfflfljfoffl

MADE ONE BITE
OF SHAFER'S EAR
Senator Grady on Trial
for an Abnormal
Appetite.
Witnesses Testify to the Fight
and to the Mutila
tion.
The Defendant Says He Was Never
N.*ar Enough to the Waiter
to Use His Teeth.
The trial of ex-Senator W. IX Grady of
Fresno on a charm of mayhem came up
yesterday before Justice of the Peace Car
roll, acting in Police Court 3 in lieu of
EX-SENATOR W. D. GRADY, Accused of Having Bitten Off
Waiter's WILLIAM SHAFER, the Orpheum Waiter
Whose Left Ear Is Said to Have Been Bitten Off by ex-
Senator Grady â The Bottle of Alcohol Containing the
Piece of Ear Bitten Off.
Judge Joachim-en, who refused I o offi
ciate after the defendant tilled an affidavit
of prejudice.
Grady is accused of engaging in a bar
room riot in tne Orpheum annex on the
early morning of January 20 last, during
which he bit off part of William Shafer's
left ear. :-'
â  t J W. W. Foote and ex-Judge Levy repre
sented the defendant and C. F. O'Calla
ghan. prosecuting attorney of ibe court,
bandied the case for the people. Attor
ney Charles Ackerman, the regular coun
sel for the Orpheum, has been prominent
as special counsel in the case since Grady's
arrest, but he failed to show up yesterday
when the case was called up for the' six
teenth time.
William Shafer, the waiter who suffered
disfiguration "during the fight, was pres
ent in his entiretyâ that is, the main por
tion of bim cat next to the prosecuting
attorney and tbe remainder tbat bad been
bitten off floated in n bottle of alcohol a
few feet away.
The prosecution brought forth a half
dozen witnesses, employes of tlie Or
pheum, who saw Grady hit Waiter Prim
roe in the eye and knock bim down.
After this exploit he knocked down a sec
ond waiter and finally grappled with tbe
complaining witness, Snafer, and bit his
ear off.
Primroe and Shafer, Ralph Ross, a
whisky merchant; Stewart William
Munch, E. M. Rosener, Henry Comoro,
Carl Steffens, all musicians, and others
were po-itiv about seeing â¢ the defendant
and Shafrr in close contact and of seeing
the waiter's bleeding ear after the melee.
The defense was well backed also by
testimony to the effect that at no time
was Grady close enough to the complain
ing witness to bite his ear.
There was John H. Hogan, an attorney,
W. W. Phillips, an ex-banker from
Fresno, a boy named Stevens and John
White, all friends of Grady, who saw some
stranger, an unknown man, separate the
defendant and Shafer as soon as they
came together. They saw no biting or
spilling of b100d. ,.7
Ex-Senator Grady told his own tale,
acknowledging he had knocked down two
waiters because one of them hed insulted
a friend of his by pushing his feet off the
table. He had not tried to bite Shnfer.
"I couldn't reach him, and 1 was not
given time in which to do it,'' the Fresno
gentleman stated.
'*Tue officer's testimony is correct.
When he arrested me after the trouble
and a crowd of men followed me out on
to tho street accusing me of biting a
man's ear off I turned to him, asked for
his pistol and told one of the fellows near-
est to me that I would bite bis â bead
off."
. The defense offered its - case without ar
gument. V**
Prosecuting Attorney O'Callagban asked
for a continuance until Tuesday or
Wednesday for bis argument, as he de
sired to consult with Attorney Ackerman,
who bad had charge of the case up to
date.
Judge' Carroll denied the, request, and
peremptorily decided he would permit no
argument after that, sitting, but would
render his decision on Monday morning
upon the record of evj.dencs submitted. -:

FINAL STRUGGLE
FOR MILLIONS
Set by the United States
Supreme ' Court for
May io.
It Will Probably End tbe Liti
gation Over the Biythe
Estate.
Points in the Brief Prepared by'G.n*
eral Hartâ lmportant Tariff
Hints.
During bis recent visit to Washington,
D.C., General W. H. H. Hart, leading
! counsel in tbe Biythe estate litigation, ar
ranged to have the final contest in this
great struggle tor the possession of mil
lions set for May 10, little more than three
weelts from the present day. ; - ,VW-;?
While at the Rational capital he also
paid cnnsiderabla attention to tariff legis
lation, and in an interview since his re
turn voiced some interesting opinions cf
value to the Pacific Coast.
General Hart left for Washington on
March 25 and returned about ten days
ago. Few were aware of his return, as he
at once closeted himself in bis office and
devoted his entire time to the preparation
of a brief to be filed in the United States
Supreme Court in connection with the
writ of error asked for by the attorneys
for the gypsy or Kentucky Blytheg. This
has now been completed and copies of it
have been served on the plaintiffs' at tor
neys. 'â â -.'";[:
In applying for the writ of error, it will
be remembered, the attorney for the
plaintiffs made the point that Florence
Biythe, having been born in England,
and not having come . into the United
States before the death of her father, was
an alien, and being an alien she could not
inherit property in the State of California
without there being a provision in the
treaty between Great Britain and the
United States permitting her to do so. In
other words Jefferson Chandler, assistant
counsel for the plaintiffs, claimed that an
alien can only inherit when a treaty ex
pressly permits it, and that the States
have no authority, by reason of their
sovereignty, to pass any law allowing
aliens to inherit, unless so permitted to
| do by treaty. ",x â .. -:_
"We meet this contention," said Gen
eral Hart, in discussing the matter, "with
several propositions in the brief tnat will
be filed at Washington a few days before
tbe matter comes up for hearing before
the Supreme Court.
"On Judge Coffey finding in the trial of
the Biythe estate that the gypsy (or Ken
tucky) Blythes were not related to Biythe
they appealed from that decision, and
the Supreme Court of California sustained
Judge Coffey. Therefore that decision
; became final as against them in the Su
preme Court of California. We contend in
our brief before the United States Su
preme Court that the writ of error shoufd
be dismissed, because if those appealing
are not related to Biythe it is none of
their business whether Florence was re
lated to Biythe or not. That is to say,
they were not aggrieved by the decision
of the State court unless they - were re
lated to Biythe. As tbe State court held
that tbey were not related to Biythe on
their, own showing, therefore they were
not interested parties. This is our first
point.
"The second point is that the contest of
heirship under section 1664 of the Code of
Civil Procedure was ended in tho Superior
Court October 22, 1890, and ended in the
Supreme Court, as to tbe| gypsy Blythes,
on the 241h of April, 1894, and therefore
tbey should have sued out their writ of

error, if at all, within the two years from
the 24th of April, 1894; that is to say, on
or before the 24th of April, 1896. Having
failed to do so thoy are barred from at
tacking the questions involved in that
contest upon a writ of error.
"The thUd point is that the right of
Florence to inherit is and was governed
by the laws of the State of California, for
the reason that Blythe was a citizen of
California and resided therein, and that
therefore California laws applied to his
property, his citizenship and her capacity
to be adopted and to inherit. We claim
that it is not a Federal question, neither
is it the province of a treaty to determine
as to whether California property can be
inherited by alt alien.
, ''Fourth and last, we claim that there is
no Federal question involved in the pro
ceedings before the State courts and was
not involved at the time of the disposition
of the estate, and that therefore the Su
preme Court of the United States has no
jurisdiction in the premises."
In support of these contentions numer
ous citations are made, the principal one
being the case of the United States
against Fox (94 U. S., 315. paÂ« 321),
where the Supreme Court held that the
tenure of real property and ,the right of
descent and inheritance are governed
wholly by the laws of the State in which
the property is situated.
Referring to the tariff situation, General
Hart took up the defense of the nickel in
dustry of the Pacific Coast.
"In the bill that passed the House," be
said, "nickel was placed on tho free list,
as well as nickel plate. There are large
deposits of nickel," he continued, "in
Oregon, Nevada and in the Northwest
nickel deposits large enough to supply the
entire demands of the United States. We
j have a sufficiently large demand in the
United States to warrant the employment
.'of ICOO men, which means a living for
5000 people.
"The nickel ore we get now comes from
Canada and is contained in copper ore,
and is refined by the Ansonia Brass Com
pany. The copper that is in the ore pays
for the transportation from the mine and
the refining, so that the nickel is all
practically profit. Canada, therefore,
does not want a tariff placed on nickel by
the United States. The duty should be at
least 10 cents a pound.
"The people who own these nickel
mines in the Unitea States say positively
that if we let nickel in free tuey would
not be able to mine their property at all.
It would practically eliminate the in
dustry from this country.
"I have no douht the Senators from
California would be very glad to see that
nickel is taken out of the free list and put
in the schedule. But they need some one
to call their attention to it, and I know of
no paper better able to do this than The
Call. ,"*.--
"Another important matter and one to
which the attention of the people of the
Pacific Coast should be called is the rule
that was adopted by the senate commit
tee for the consideration of questions re
lating to the pronosed tariff bill. No argu
ments will be permitted, but any person
interested may forward to the committee
tppewritten or printed arguments on any
questions they desire and they will be
fully considered." .â ^ : ;7:

THE FIELD OF SPORT.

Rowing, Coursing, Angling, Shooting,
Baseball, Etc.
Fan Francisco is a City that is fast be

doubtful if interest in the sport will ever

The withdrawal of the Olympic Club
from the Amateur Athletic Union was not
unexpected. The Call suggested that the
Olympic Club sever its connection with
the union at the time when outdoor ath
letic sports commenced to show signs of
decadence, but the. club continued its
membership, thinking that the laws of
the union would be altered at the
annual meeting so that better prizes
could be given to the athletes
who contested in track and field events.
But the union grew less liberal and its
laws were changed to please a few and
displease the great majority of athletes.
The result of the exceedingly hard rulings
of the union caused a split among the
clubs that composed the A. A. U., and
now the Western clubs and associations
will organize and establish what will be
known as the California Athletic Associ
ation, with laws to govern itself.
Coursing, angling, trap-shooting, yacht
ing, rowing, baseball and cricket are
branches of sport that are becoming more
popular yearly.
THE WHEELMEN.
Prospects of a Two Days' Meet at
the Velodrome Next. Month.
The settling of the protest- over the re
cent relay race and the amicable adjust
ment of the strained relations between the
Bay City Wheelmen and Olympic Club
Wheelmen, brought about by the talk and
"banter over another proposed race, have
been the source of a great deal of satis
faction to the organized wheelmen here
who desired to see harmony prevail â¢ be-,
tween the clubs at the present time, when
so much of importance io the future of
cycling in this State depends on the main
tenance of harmony among the clubs. All
are now free to devote their untiring el
forts toward the building up of the Cali
fornia Associated Cycling Clubs, which
has assumed the work formerly conducted
by the League of American Wheelmen in
this State, and which, it is expected,' will
do far more good for wheelmen iv general
than the league ever did, to say nothing
ol the added pride and satisfaction of
working for a purely home institution.
At th 6 meeting ot the board of govern
ors of the association Thursday night be
fore the matter of the relay protest was
taken up Henry F. Wynne addressed the
board upon the subject of the organized
wheelmen giving substantial support to
the road improvement now going on in
this county known as the Balboa boule
vard. He told of the location and pur
pose of the driveway, of the advantage it
would be to cyclists, of the sentiment at
taching to the work in the way it was aid
ing the unemployed, and urged that the
matter be brought before the various
clubs by their delegates then present for
the purpose of securing some financial
BUDpori for the project from the different !
clubs. Mr. Wynne, always an interesting j
speaker, was listened to attentively, and
his remarks were heartily applauded, j
showing that the wheelmen are in full j
sympathy with the movement. It is -ex
pected that the different clubs will take
the matter up at their respective meet
ings.
The Cycle Board of Trade donated $50
toward the Balboa boulevard fund at its
annual meeting last Tuesday night as an.
evidence of the dealers' interest in the un
dertaking.
Captain Henry L. Bay has called a club
run of the Bay City Wheelmen for to
morrow to Taylor's ranch, near San An
selrao, Marin County, taking the 9:15 a. m.
Sausalito boat, according to the captain's j
notice, though if he will glance at the j
time-taole ol this route he will learn that
the boat leaving at that hour only runs j
on weekdays, the Sunday morning sche
dule being 8, 10. and 11:30. This will i
probably necessitate the run going over on j
the 10 o'clock boat, as boats leaving at 8 I
or thereabouts bave long since been
tabooed by the rank and file of cycle club
life as leaving entirely too early for the
ordinary plebeian club run.
Captain J. S. Lewis oi the San Fran
cisco Road Club has called a run of the
club lor Sunday to the park and Cuff
House. Tho run is to leave the club
promptly at 1:30 o'clock p. m.
On jast Sunday forty-eight of the mem
bers attended the initial run of the cluo
for the season of 1897 to San Mateo to meet
the club's San .lose members. A most
pleasant day ' was spent by all who at
tended. Arrangements were made and a
substantial dinner was spread at the
Union Hotel, after which the boys en
joyed a game of ball anu a swim and at 4
o'clock the start was made for home.
There will be a five-mile handicap road
race of the club iv the very near future,
and a large entry is looked for. The enter
tainment committee nas decided to hold a
smoker at the club next month, and they
say that they have several otner attrac

The many friends of Charles S. Wells,
the popular professional racer of this
City, have been deii-hied to read in the
Eastern press dispatches dnring the past
ten days of his remarkable success on the
indoor tracks at Nashville and Memphis,
Term., and one or two other points at
which Jack Prince's Southern Circuit
touches. Wells is leading such men as
Egton, McFarland and Weinig across the
tape, and he must be riding mighty fast
to do that.
Clarence N. Ravlin, editor of the Olym
pic, is to be married next Mon lay in San
Jose to Miss Minnie Howe Wastie, and
his many friends in the cycling world,
both here and in the Garden City, wish
him long happiness on his ride through
life en tandem.
It is possible that there may be a two
days' meet here at the Velodrome, Satur
day and Sunday, May 1 aud 2. At any
rate there will be a meet on Sunday, the
2d, being the first Sunday race meet held
in California, and under the rules of the
California Associated Cycling Clubs in
stead of those of the League of American
â Wheelmen. I don't think the difference
will be noticeable except that it may be a
better meet than any we have ever held. g*

Considerable interest is being manifested
in the special match race which is to take
place shortly -between Joe Caranzo. the
North Beach champion,' and Kiley Quln
lan, the well-known turfman and exDert
biker. The match . was â¢ the , result: of a
little bantering that took' place between
the twain, and it is to be for blood. Both
riders are now in active training. Quinlan
at the Oakland racetrack and Caranzo in
this City. As each- is a. strict amateur
they will not race for a stake, but it has
been arranged so that the winner will be.
awarded a medal. In the meantime the
friends and admirers of ; the rider's are
doing some lively betting on the' outcome.
The contest will probably, take place: at

THE PUGILISTS.
The Manhattan.. Athletic. Club En

The Manhattan Athletic' Club will give
an entertainment this evening, and as
there are quite a number of attractions on
the programme the club expects a large
attendance. AA**' A;!", r<
The Olympic Club has at last secured a
match for next month. The committee
on boxing has been unfortunate in its en
deavors to induce Tommy Ryan to visit
this City for the purpose of meeting
George Green in a twenty-round bout. If -
Green and Ryan were matched the club
could safely count upon a large attend
ance, as the pugilists would give tbe
sporting people a good run for their
money; but when Ryan refused tbe offer
of the club then the committee had to
look elsewhere for talent, and by a good
stroke of luck it received the consent of
Gans, the great colored pugilist of. Balti
more, to fight Mike Leonard a twenty
round bout in this City.
The club is now corresponding with the
managers of two well-known pugilists, and
if arrangements can be made satisfactory
to all concern a second attraction that
should prove a most interesting affair will
add to the programme of fisticuffs of the
Olympic for May.
Prank Gilbert, the old warhorse of the
Olympic Club who recently joined the
professional ranks, is anxious to arrange a
match with â¢ Plater, the pugilist who
whipped Morris^ey a few evenings ago at
the People's Palace Theater.
If the referees of proessional boxing
contests will not take any cognizance of
the cleverness displayed by contestants
during a battle and score points accord
ingly as they are made in each round,
from start to finish, they may just as well
announce prior to the contest that if a
knockout does not result and tbat if the
contestants are on their feet at the end of
the bout a draw will result.
The words, "he is a boxer and tbe other
fellow is a fighter," are now frequently
used by sporting men to draw a line of
comparison between fighters. For in
stance, the Greggains and Stelzner match.
The former was the boxer and the last
named the fighter.
Greggains "put it all over" Stezner for
ten rounds,* and consequently scored a
strong lead -points. -In the last half of
the contest honors ware about even, but
the referee decided the match a draw,
which decision, although very satisfac
tory to a majority of the spectators, was
not in accordance with ring rules. Greg
gains, having had the better of the argu
ment by a large majority in the first ten
rounds of the fight, was entitled to a de
cision in bis favor, but the referee con
cluded that. as both contestants had put
up a game and stubborn battle a draw
would receive general favor.
Of Referee Pringle only one thing can
be said, and that is he will decide a con
test as he thinks right and just. When
be declared the match a draw be was satis
fied tbat any other decision would bring a
volume of hisses on the beads of the
club.
Charley Goff, the young and promising
pugilist of tbe Mission, who made a chop
ping -block of Thompson (colored) on
Wednesday evening, has a brilliant future.
With proper care he should give a first
class account ot himself wnen ha grows a
little older and develops strength and
muscle. He is a very clean bitter, and is
as cool as an icechest wnen fighting. /â¢".,:â¢'.
The California Athletic Club has elected

TROUT FISHING.
An Article From an Expert Angler-
Which Is Instructive and
Interesting:.
An angler who has mastered the gentle
art of fly-casting should find very little
difficulty in basketing a nice mess of trout
from any of the large coast streams,, but
anglers must not lose. sight of the fact
that they (the anglers) are much larger
than a seven or eight inch steelhead and
that the fishes are always on tbe alert and
quick, to discern danger, ahead. If the
'gentle artists" will only remember when
casting their flies over a clear stretch of
water that they must keep well out of
sight of the denizens of the stream they
will .find that success will crown their
efforts. Long-distance casting is neces- |
sary, and at this season, wben the creeks
are clenrand comparatively low, the fishes
generally lie in wait for a fluttering insect
at the head or tail of a riffle. The royal
coachman, March brown and hare's ear in
yellow should prove very killing flies dur- I
ing tnis month.
The i Call has received word from Glen |
Ellen that trout are taking flies very I
readily in the Sonoma, above the town of
Glen Ellen, and that some very nice fish
were caught during the week." Fly-fish
ing is also good in the tributaries of the
Big Sulphur and several other streams on
he line of the San Francisco and North
Pacific Railroad. Fiv or fix large fish
were taken from the Paper-mill Creek in
the vicinity of -Point Reyes last Sunday,
and the outlook for several good catches
of small fishes to-morrow is very good.
RIFLE AT SHELL MOUND.
The Red MÂ»n Will Hold an Eagle
" Shoot To-Morrow-Other '
Events'.
There will "be considerable rifle-shooting
at the Shell Mound rifle range to-morrow.
The Schuetzen Section of the Red -Men
will hold one its principal events of the
yearâ the eagle shoot to determine who
is the* king for the year. The eagle will be
a large wooden "bird,"' whose vital parts
are wooden peps that hold together the
wings, legs, head, tail, a ring and a crown.
K*ch ot these brought down by a rifle
bullet means a prize to the lucky marks
man. The King is be who sends a bullet
through the heart, represented by a peg
surrounded by an iron shield. The eagle
will be placed upon a tall pole by Captain
L. Siebe on the beacu south of the main
shooting range.
Besides this, event Companies, A and F
of the Fifth Infantry Regiment and B and
L of the First will hold their i monthly
conteÂ«t*< for 'class medals. The Knights
of the Red Branch R.fles will hold a simi
lar contest, and the members of the San

their usual shooting stalls for practice.
There is some tolltof a ; team match by
fifteen men each from- Companies B and I

THE SAN FRANCISCO] ALL, SATURDAYS APRIL 17, 1897.
PLAN FOR THE PRISON IN THE NEW HALL OF JUSTICE.
The plans for the prison in the Hall of Justice have been completed by the architects, Shea & Shea. The prison will
occupy all of the top or the fourth floor of the building. This is a complete novelty in the matter of prisons. It carries the
idea that a prison should be a dungeon under ground, which has obtained from the days of moats and feudal castles, to the
opposite extreme, giving the prisoners the benefit of the skylight as well as a ride in the elevator. A"~
; The architects offer a number of good reasons for this. It greatly increases the chances in favor of keeping them safely,
they say, both as against tbeir own efforts at escape as well as against the possibility of attack from the outside and attempt
at rescue. When the prisoner arrives at the entrance to the Hall of Justice he is placed in an elevator-cage which is itself a
cell. He is run directly to the top floor and finds himself in a big room with steel cells on every aide. At one end of the room
is the Captain's desk and to the right of it is the searchroom. If he is a bad character and a thorough search is deemed desir
able he is taken to the little room. He is booked by the Captain and committed to the cell to which he is best adapted. There
are several groups of cells â one for hardened criminals, another for first offenders and another for women, and so on. These
cells are equipped and strengthened according to their uses or the demands to be put on them. All of the cells stand out from
the wall with a free passageway all round them. Each group is surrounded by an iron grating eight feet high. The officer
may stand at the gate and by means of the Pawly system open all the cells or any one of them, summoning the prisoners
from within. In case of attempted jail-break the prisoners of any group of cells find three outside iron gratings to be got
through or over before they are in the main corridor, and when they are there they are still at the top of a high building. So
while the top-floor prison affords the prisoners more healthful quarters, it also removes them further from the possibility of
escape. A 7,*! ",''â ' '-; ,'â ', A

ter of even date Is at nand ana noted. An ab
stract' of the clause in the; deed of gilt ur-on
which we rely in tendering the cud to the San
Francisco Yacht â  Club Is as follows: "And in
case snen grantee r-boulrt fall to nominate and
provide a yacht to meet the challenger, then
the cup shall be delivered to the senior yacht
club in existence at that time on the San Fran
cisco Bay."
Now, our club has already determined to re
fuse to nominate or provide a yacht to meet
any challenger for the present season. I do
not think it is necessary for our club to wait
until a challenge is made, and 1 do not think
that the donors of the cup would so construe
this clause of the deed of gilt. It is perfectly
clear that if we do not provide a yacht to meet
the challenger, then the cup would necessarily
co to the San Francisco Yacht Club, it being
the senior club now in existence on the Kan
Francisco Bay, and by this waiting it would
prevent a race for the present season, and we
deem it fairand better tor the yachting inter
est to tender the cup thus early beiore the
clubs have had their openings and before the
time for aay challenge.
Of course it is notour intention to challenge
for the cup, but we hope to sees race between
your club and some other club. Respectfully,

The Artels Will Hold a Regatta To-
Morrow at Long Bridge.
All arrangements have been completed
for to-morrow's inter-club regatta of the
Ariel Rowing Club. The races will be
rowed over the Long Bridge course, and
will be a mile ana a half with a turn, thus
affording a full view of the start and
finish. Races will be called at 10:30 a. m.
Four contestants are entered for the first
event, the senior stiffâ William J. Mc-
Causland, G. W. Phelan, Robert Ellis and
James Wilson. V-A
This race is expected to prove most
exciting. McCausland is a clever oars
man, and in last year's regattas he suc
ceeded in lowering the colors of the ac
knowledged champions of other clubs in
the out-r.eeer skiff contests. Mr. Phelan,
who holds the championship ot the Pacific
Coast in this style of rac ng, has beaten
the very same cracks as McCausland. As
these two men have never met in a race
before, the result will bo interesting.' .'.
James Wilson and Robert Ellis have
met before, winning first and second prizes
respectively. Ellis, though a beaten man,
feels confident of making matters rather
warm for his 'opponents.
. The junior skiff race will introduce four
aspirants: G. T. McGinness, H. A. Pless,
J. R. Bockman and Johnson Hardy.
McGinness is probably, in the best con
dition. Bockman will surely give a good
account of himself. 7H. A. Piess, the dark
horse, has been training in the morning
hours between 5 and 7. Hardy says noth
ing, but has a knowing wink.

BERKELEY, Cal., April 16â The Ag
ricultural building of the State Univer
sity, with its contents, one of the most
valuaole structures on the grounds, was
destroyed by lire this afternoon, the
flames causing a cash loss variously esti
mated at from $15,000 to $20,000. and con
suming a quantity of statistical docu
ments, specimens and scientific reports
that were invaluable and cannot be re
placed.
The tire was discovered a few minutes
after 1 o'clock, when classes were just as
sembling lor the afternoon recitations.
All the students at once ran for the scene
cf the conflagration and the men joined
forces in a lively battle with the flames.
They entered the building and saved all
the movables that could be carried or
thrown to the grouud.
For fifteen minutes books, documents,
instruments and specimens showered from
all the windows of the structure, each
room being filled with excited students
intent upon saving what they could. In
tbe general confusion even fire-extinguish
ers were thrown from the windows and
many delicate instruments were spoiled. â¢
Of the books and papers hurled from the
building many v.ere subsequently burned,
being set on tire by falling embers.
Professor Charles Howard Shinn and
Mrs. Shinn were in the building
wnen the fire broke out. The alarm was
given by Webster '9Sand Denicke, and the
college hre brigade was called out by
James Carpenter. The fire brigade has
been drilling recently under Captain Kell.
ner and responded quickiy to thÂ© call
made upon it. â¢..;
The town fire companies were also sent j
for, and soon the entire fire-fighting force :
of Berkeley was at the building.- â â¢â¢â¢ â¢-
The -firemen found a Â«cene* of lively J
work when they arrived, students and fac- j
ulty alike being busy saving portable prop** j
. erty. ,
Professor Plehn of the department of
political economy had a wheelbarrow,
â with which ha did efficient service. Lieu
tenant Winn of the military department,
Professor Shinn of the forestry station
and A". P. Hayne of the department of
Viticulture were at work with about 200
ttudents carrying desks, books, instru
ments, papers and whatever they could
lay their hands on out of reach of the
flames.
Upward of 2000 people, a large propor
tion of them students and members cf the
faculty, were gathered around South Hall
watching the blaze, which at that time
reached high into the air.
The regular firemen hastily cot their
hose ready for work, aided by the col
legians. It was necessary to go about 800
feet for water, and the placing of -hose
consumed much time. .;â â '-. A *
Tne tire-lighters directed their water at
different parts of the building, and soon

too well started to be more than slightly
delayed in its work of destruction. -.
A crowd of students took up places on
tbe roof of the stables adjoining, and

The beat was most. intense, but th* col

from Strawberry Creek. The firemen and ;
students at work on. tho main building
also bravely kept their places amid scorch
ing heat and many falling timbers. ; Sev

rested against the buiidinps, and on which

By 3 o'clock the interior of the building
was almost burned out, and the flames
were under control, leaving a portion of
the walls and three big chimneys stand
ing. As a result of the efforts of .the fire
fighters the stables were unharmed, and
some property in the basement of the
building was saved. /
Tha destroyed building contained the
departments of agriculture, entomology
and viticulture. The loss to these depart
ments by the destruction of records and
material is incalculable. Professor Hil
gard lost a collection of extremely valu
able plants, tne result of forty years' work.
"Very many of the specimens were of
ereat value," said Professor Hilgard, after
the tire, "and a large proportion of them
it will be impossible to replace. The finan
cial loss is probably $15,000, a large part of
it being in the property destroyed in the
basement. A wine cellar had 'been con
structed at great expense, and it con
tained a large quantity of wines that were
of high value tor scientific purposes.
"Most of our IS_7 reports are lost, and
all the department reports and docu
ments since 1887, except a few copies that
are on filo in the university library."
The destruction of these documents is a
most serious blow to the work of Professor
Hileard's department, which mainly con
sisted in compiling and securing exhaus
tive statistics of agricultural work and ex
periment. The department is a National
agricultural station and is one of the most
important in the country. It kept valu
able records affecting all parts of the
Pacific Coast, and the professors and in
structors in charge are constantly at work
upon the business of collecting data and
conducting experiments for the benefit of
agriculturists.
Though the number of students is not
large, the department is one of the busiest
at Berkeley.
In the interruption of all this work, and
in the destruction of results ana speci
mens gathered during forty years of labor,
the loss is far ahead of the financial esti
mates of the worth of the property that
was burned. The building was erected in
1387, and was reconstructed last year. It
was a wooden structure, ana not of par
ticular .value in itself.
It is thought that much more might
have been saved bad there been proper
provisions for fighting the fire. There
were no axes to be found nearer than
South Hall, no hose was at hand and no
water was near. The disaster will be used
as an argument for tbe establishment of
an efficient fire department in connection
with the university. The heavy destruc
tion is a complete owing to the law
removing all insurance from State build
ings.
Other most unfortunate results may
transpire from the disaster. It is said
that the other departments may now be
as short of money aa they ever have been,
as a good sum will be needed to provide
new quarters for the departments now
without a building.
The origin of the fire is generally
thought to have been a gasjet left burning
in the bacteriological laboratory.* The
accepted theory is that the flame was near
the wall, and, as the entire room was very
dry and warm from the use of the "dryer"
employed, a conflagration was easily
started.
The building was occupied by the office
and classrooms of Professor E. W. Hil
gard, head of the agricultural depart
ment; Professor E. J. Wickson, Assistant
Professor R. H. Loughrldge, Professor C.
W. Woodworth, head of the entomoloci
cal department. Instructor il. E. Jaffa,
George E. Colby, and F. J. Bioletti. Pro
fessor Wickson had just left to take the 1
o'clock train to San Francisco, and Pro
fessor Hilxard was at lunch in his resi
dence when the flames broke out.

Talesmen Telling; Why They Could Not Possibly Sit on the Jury.
FEW ANXIOUS
FOR JURY DUTY
Work of Pruning the Panel
for the Great Fair
.Case.
Sixty -Five Left Out of the
One Hundred and Fifty Vj-
Drawn.
Judge Slack Declines to Accept Nu
merous Excuses of Illness and
Business Pressure.
No policeman ever listened to such a se
ries of harrowing hard lucx stories as
were told to Superior Judge Slack yester
day morning when he summoned before
him the 150 talesmen drawn for the trial
which is destined to settle Mrs. Nettie
Craven's claims on the estate of James G.
Fair.
The occasion was the customary exam
ination of the selected citizens for/the
purpose of ascertaining, whether or not
they are qualified to serve as jurors. It
is quite evident from Judge Slack's expe-
rience of yesterday that the prospect of a
lone and tedious trial has had the effect
of scaring the talesmen into a desire to es
cape trom the panel.
' Out of the 150 drawn, but 35 stood
up and confessed that they had no excuses
to offer for not serving. The rest of them
came prepared with all sorts of pleas and
prayers to be allowed to go their several
ways. Throats swathed in flannels were
liberally in evidence; limbs were in splints
and the' chorus of rasping and hollow
coughs that continually echoed through
the room was enough to convince every
body except a judge who had had previous
experience 'with talesmen 7 that all the
; world was afflicted with the plague. True
many of the tales of woe" poured into his
Honor's ear yesterday had -merit, and
those who told., them â _ were excused but
[others .were . palpably conjured up for the
occasion and invariably were unsuccessful
in their purpose.
â¢ Judge Slack held court in the roomy
chamber of the Board of Supervisors , in
order to be away from the noise of the
roofers who are at work just over his own
courtroom. Nearly all ot the legal lights
I who are connected with the litigation over i
| the Fair millions were on hand and
j watched the pruning of the panel with
i keen interest. Every one of them realizes
; how important is the personnel of the jury
that is to be selected. There was also a
large crowd of spectators in attendance.
After the clerks had checked off the
names of the thirty-five who had signified
their willingness to submit themselves to
the lawyers' test and to do their duty as
good citizens, Judge Slack instructed those
who were seeking to escape the panel to
form into line, and in their turn, offer
their excuses. The court deplored the
growing tendency of citizens to dodge jury
duty, and announced tbat he would allow
none to go except those who could con
vince him that thoy, were not qualified to
act, or that their service woula result in
distress or hardship. Then the talesmen
were all sworn to speak nothing but the
truth, and the hard luck stories began.
C. W. Taber was the first to tell his
troubles.- It would be impossible, for him
to serve, ho -said, because he had a most
important business "appointment, Â«to keep
on the Ist of June. Judge Slack shook
j his head and said that was not strong
I enough. .Besides, the trial would prob
ably be finished by the Ist of June, so he
told Mr. Taber he would have to remain
on the panel. ...
An audible snicker ran .through the
court as the disappointed talesman
dropped out of the line mumbling about
his luck.
J. A. Schultz evidently considered that
he had a Knap. His hearing was so defec-
I tive, he declared, tbat he would certainly
I be found to be rather a nuisance during
j the trial than a useful juror.
Judge Slack, lowering his voice to a
whisper, told the gentleman that he would
be ever bo pleased if he would seive.
"I appreciate the compliment, Judge,
but, you see, I can't hear good enough."
said Mr. Schults.
A quiet smile illuminated bis Honor's
countenance. If the talesman could bear
a whisper he guessed he could also hear
I the evidence, so Mr. Schultz would have
to serve.
E. H. Benker and W. J. Goshen stepped
forth together, and said they had business
of such tremendous importance on their
bands that it would be disastrous /or them
to be imprisoned on a jury. But the court
thought that the Fair litigation was of im
portance, too, and refused to give them
their walking papers.
Gas consumers achieved a triumph when
Judge SlicK held Alfred Coddy on the
panel. Mr. Coddy examines meters and
makes out those awful gas 'bills, but he
stands a good chance now of being com
pelled to ease up in his work for a time.
"I'm troubled with chronic bronchitis,
your Honor," pleaded Peter Fay when his
turn came.
"I don't think I can accept that as an
excuse," replied Judge Slack.
"I have heart trouble, too."
â¢'The trial will not be such as might
make you any worse. You look quite
well to-day." .. '....â 
â¢'I am suffering from general debility
also," was Fay's next. -
' "No, I can't spare you,',' stubbornly said
the court.
Mr. Fay scratched his head in the hope
of remembering some other wasting ill to
which, he was heir. â .-; Suddenly, his face
lighted tip and. he announced that he was
already serving as a juror in Judge Cof
fey's court. .....,., . â¢ â  T ". ,*â * ." .â ;â¢"â 
'Oh, if that's so, you can be excused,"
said tho Judge, so Mr. Fay went his way
rejoicing. .'â â¢ â â '.â¢ ' , A;*..
James S. Ford said his plumbing busi
ness would go to rack and ruin if he was
not excused, but the court could not see it
that way. .Â»>3g33BgÂ£jgsQÃÃÃftSW|
Daniel Block, a cutter in. the tailoring
department of the Emporium, had the
distinction of being the first to melt his
Honor's heart and escape service. And
after him a lot of them were successful.
Mr. Block's excuse was that he was work
ing for wages and might lose his employ
ment were he to be neld on the panel.
Herman Pollock said he was a soap-seller',
and if he neglected his aaily route would
lose his trade. He got off, too. 'So did
George merer, whose partner was laid
; up sick, leaving the entire care of their
business on his hands. A. E. Nye had
just got a job. and his fear of losing it
prompted the court to let him go. Horace
Lando had sickness in his family and was
excused, while Sam Sachs escaped by ex
hibiting a certificate showing tbat fee had
already seen jury service this season.
Samuel . Allesky tried the pressure-of
business dodge, but it .would not wort.
Jonas Erlanger was more successful. 'If
he should be sworn in as a juror there
would be only an office-boy left to look
nf ter his commission businej.-. -William
md is a clerk for. Goldberg, Bowen &
Co. and stood in danger of losing his posi

got off because he would have to close up

and Thomas F. Boyle escaped on a similar
excuse. S gmund Shoenberg, who 'sells
linings at L'OU Post street, tolu a story like
Mund' s, but made the mistake of admit
ting that he had two employes at his
place who might [possibly keep the busi
ness going. He was told to stay on the
panel. William John's plea was that he
had too much property to look after, but

Cyrus L. Gates used his hand for a

But unfortunately for him he heard all of
the Jud.e's questions, even though they
I were whispered, and he was promised a
j front seat in the jury-box should the law-
I yers accept him. T*-***;.!
I And so it went on for a full hour. When
j Judge Slack had finally gone through the
, I line it was found that the list of talesmen
I who were qualified to serve had increased
I from thirty-five to sixty-five. They were
j all notified to be in court Monday morn

CONVICTS ATTACK
EDITOR PRICE
He Is Jumped Upon and
Bruised Without Any
Warning.
His Mother Says That Religious
Feeling Caused the As
sault
â¢Â»
Affidavits Have Already Been Filed
and an Investigation Will
Soon F. Uow.
A strange report comes from San Quen
tin of an attempt to murder Convict
Warren E. Price, the well-known A. P. A.
writer and editor of The Light.
About a week ago, the . story runs, a
murderous assault was made upon him,
according to Mrs. Thomas, his mother.
Price had scarcely Deen in the peniten
tiary a week, having been sentenced for
eighteen months for sending obscene mat
ter through the mails, wben he was
pounced upon and badly bruised by cer
tain convicts that took exceptions to
Price's religious ideas. His mother says
that her son would probably have been
killed but for the bravery of Convict
Lambert, former Clerk of the Oakland Po
lice Court.
Price and Lambert, as the story runs,
were stationed in a short corridor through
which the prisoners who are employed at
the jutemill are marched on going to
work. The duty of Lambert was to count
the men as they filed through a narrow
gate by which entrance to the corridor is j
gained. Price was ordered to keep tally
ot the count on a slate. It was in this coi
ridor that the attack on Price occurred.
The ball is narrow and short. At one
end ie a gate which is wide enough to ad
mit but one man at a time. At the other
end is the entrance to the jutemill, in
which 700 men are employed.
At a moment when the guards' view of
Price and Lambert was obscured by the
long file of men an attack was made on
Price. It was. according to Guard Dan
Sullivan, one of the worst rows that * as
occurred since the prison began-. After
the row was over, says Mrs. Thomas,
whose information comes from her son, a
knife with a six-inch blade was found on
tbe floor.
Mrs. Thomas said last night: "Priest
Lagan has advised all the prisoners of bis
faith to keep their hands off Warren,
and they may be silent for a long time."
The report is that Murderer McNulty
and a prisoner named O'Brien made the
most vigorous assault on the prisoner,
jumping upon him and trying to kill
him.
Captain Jameson wielded his club
vigorously and prevented any further dis
turbance after the first assault. McNulty
claimed to be one of the assistants, that he
did all he could to shield Price.
Captain Jameson and Convict Lamoert
prevented the convicts from seriously in
juring the prisoner.
There is no attempt on the part of many
convicts to hide their hatred for the man
who was convicted for selling obscene
works. .A full report of the matter, with
Price's version, is expected in a few days.
- Price was not badly hurt and bis only
injuries consist of bruises.
It is stated on the part of some of
Price's friends that the fracas was merely
the result of personal animosity between
the ex-publisher and one of his fellow
convicts. '
NOE VALLEY PROGRESS.
East of the Twin Teaks Ia Adding to
the City's Wealth in Im
provements.
That section of the warm belt known as Noe
Valley, which lies at the eastern slope of the
Twin Peaks, is making wonderful improve
ment in the settlement of a prosperous class of
citizens who have transformed the valley from
a cattle run into an improved section of the
City by the erection of handsome dwellings.
"The only school building in this section is
the James Lick School, on Twenty-fifth and
Noe streets, and this is far too small to ac
commodate the scholars living on the eastern
edge of the valley. "-77;
To remedy this crowded condition a vacant
grocery-store on the corner of Jersey and Noe
streets has been rented by the School Direc
tors as a temporary place for the overflow.
But even this provision falls to meet the re
quirements of the people, and, as a conse
quence, those residing on the west of Castro
street have asked the directors fora building
in tneir midst. *
AN INTERMITTENT HEART
STOPPED EVERY THIRD BEAT.
But Mrs. Strope's Heart Now No Longer
Lag*, but Throbs Regularly.
From the Leader, Cleveland, Ohio.
In a large, commodious house at No. 104
Huntington street, C eveland, Ohio, lives Mrs.
Emily A. Strope, widow of the late X. M.
Strope, and she is the mother of a young man
who has been and is now one of this city's
successful and energetic pharmacists. Mr*.
Strope, who has lateiy recovered from serious
cardiac difficulty, when questioned by a re
porter regarding her late illness stated as
follows:
"Two years ago I had my first experience
with Dr.' Williams* Pink Pills. For a long
time I was troubled with an ailment which I
feared would eventually drive me crazy un
less 1 rid myself of it. It will sound strange,
no doubt, to some, but my heart did not bent
as it should. Its action was Irregular. There
would be ' two pulsation*, or perhaps
three, and then a sudden ' cessation.
My heart seemed to rest for the period
of one or two beats, and then resume
its' action. "Sometimes such lapses would
not be so frequent as that, but, scarcely ;
a day passed that they did not occur. It felt
as tuough something would strike the heart
with great tores and â  push it out of place.
During tbat period, whenever I lay down to
sleep or rest, my hands would become per
fectly numb and helpless. I could feel th*
temporary paralysis coming over them, but I
could do nothing which would prevent it. My
feet were affected in a like manner, and I had
considerable difficulty ia walking when such
a spell had possession of me: Naturally that
state of affairs completely upset mv nerves,
and any one whose nervous system is well
nigh shattered^ can appreciate and under
stand the misery, chiefly mental; which I en
dured. I - lost much Jleep and rest, and often
I was compelled from sheer exhaustion to alt
down during âthe day to obtain some repose.
But as soon as did so I felt that, numb seda
tion come over my'; hands and feet, and I
rocked violently in my chair to drive it away,
but frequently to no avail. -,â¢ - '
- "One day my son, who was keeping a drug
store at the time, brought me home-some of
Dr. Williams' Pink , Pills for Pale People and
advised me to take tbem for mv heart trouble.
I did so and soon began to feel better. I used
tbe pills about two men and they certalnlv
cured me, for now my heart beats regularly
and all numbness, ha-- disappeared, aud my
circulation is in splendid order. ' -t â¢
We print the above, hoping Mrs. Strope's ex
perience may be beneficial to others who may
suffer from derangement of the heart.
Dr. Williams'. Pink. Pills contain, in a con
densed form, all the elements t-ecessarv to
give new life and richness to the blood snd re
store shattered nerves. They are an unfailing
specific for such disease-) -as locoraoter ataxia,
partial paralysis, St. Vitus' '. dance, sciatica,
neuralgia, rheumatism, nervous headache,
the after effect of la grippe, palpitation of the
heart, pale and sallow complexions, all forms
of weakness, either; in male or female. Pink
Pills are sold by all dealers, or will be sent
postpaid on receipt of price, 50 cents a box.

COFFEE COMPARATIVELY HIGH.
-member of a prominent coffee importing firm,
In an interview with a representative of the New
V.'Â»r_ Shipping ant Commercial Ist, regarding a
cccline In the prices of Brazil coffee, said: **Tlie
tendency of values of raw material* the world
over has been steadily downward. The value of
sugar Is about one-third of what it was fifteen
years ago. irou probably one-third, corn one-thiid.
k ;i.,v,a;iJ tea one- third, while wool, cotton and
wneal are anywhere from 40 to 60 per cent less
than they were then, Coffee is the only oue that
has held its own since 1862. In fact, it is higher
now than it was then, while the cost of produc
tion, transportation ana nandlicx it bas decreased
everywhere. lor this reason the only argument
In favor of coffee, the price itself, is not absolutely
tenable. The price, indeed, is of great conse
quence as soon as it g-ts below the cost o: pro
duction, but coff.e is a long way from that."

WOOL-Jacob Wollner's circular says: "The
local market is somewhat quieter. Buyers' hold
ings of Wools that have arrived so far aie too high
for scourers. The slippers are busy packing their
country purchases to ship Ease. Eastern markets
are reported quieter, with prices well sustained.
There is still Â«ome buying going on ln the country.
Most y all the Nevada Wools have been bought I
up, most of them for this marke:. There ha*, not
been so much business done in spring Wools up to
this lira* since lhl-0. Wools arrive very freely
and warebous-s ate filling up. The mar
ket can be reported strong, but with smal
sales." Spring clip is quoted as follows: Moun

COALâ Harrison's circular ears: "Daring the
week there have been live arrivals from British
Columbia wlih 16,457 tons of Coal, four from Ore
gon wiih 2070 tons, three from Tacoma with 7850
tons and from J. pan 150 ions, aggregat
ing 25,537 tons. The quantity coming to hand is
ample for our immediate requirements, although
lt .s coming almost entirely from the i,oriheru col
lieries. If the coast deliveries are not diminished
later in the year we shall certainly have a large
accumulation In yard, as by that time we shall
have liberal arrivals from Auuralia and England,
and our supply will greatly exceed tha demand.
Besides, our summer weather has rome at last,
and win assuredly remain with us lor several
months thereb-- decreasing the consumption for
domestic purposes. The English and Australian
tonnage engaged to transport coal here will now
foot up a capacity of 225.00;* tons, showing that
new charters are being constantly effected. As
freight rates from Australia are again strength
ening It will lead to li-si shipments, besides tbe
anticipated Increased duty wilt -cause shippers to
load less on vessel's account, and await sales prior
to making any ventures. Ail cargoes of Welsh
and Australian now coming, to hand are Immedi
ately delivered to consumers, as most of the whole
sale dealers are backward in their contracts and
the stocks here exceptionally small." Wellington.

All Celebrated on One Hay.
At Piongastel, in Brittany, on one day
in February last thirty-four couples were
simultaneously joined together in holy
matrimony. Tne ceremony was very
pretty, all the brides and bridegrooms
wearinc Breton costumes, and walking in
procession round the town, loilowed by
their fathers and mothers, their brothers,
their sisters, their cousins, and their
aunts. The wedding breakfast was laid
out in detachments, hardly a building in
the village being exempt from makintr
room for a portion. There were 2000
guests distributed among the lofts, barns
and kitchens; pates were conspicuous
by their absence, and a dish of food was
supplied to every four persons. The fes
tivities lasted for a week, and included
many curious old Breton customs. â Tit

GAME OF CINCH
This Time Mr. Rice of Hay

as the Victim.

ter, Rosa.
The Sam? 0 i Story Is hearsed Play

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
008 Broadway, April 16 j'
Through the good services of the Span
ish Consul at San Francisco H. D. Rice
of Hay wards has been saved from befog
fleeced and possibly from death and a
bold system of swindling has been ex
posed that is being operated from Spain
to California.
The details of the scheme have puzzled
the police for some time and at different
times communications have passed be
tween officials in this country and those
nt Madrid, but with no pronounced bene
fit. The case of Mr. Rice is the second
one that has come to light with absolute
certainty as to the plan of procedure, the
other one being located at Napa.
The plan of the bold operator is nearly
uniform in all cases. There is always a
man in trouble in Spain who has a lovely
daughter, for whose future he is most
solicitous. He suddenly discovers that he
has some relatives whom he has not seen
since childhood in California. He writes
to them and says he is in trouble and lias
is larue estate which te will deed to his
Californian friend if the latter will only
look after his girl. The transfers of prop
erty and the young lady are both to be
brought cut here by a Catholic priest
when the necessary assurances have been
given.
Some time ago H. D. Rice of Haywards
received a letter from Spain that caused
him a certain amount of uneasiness. The
Rice family is one of the oldest and best
known in Haywards and came from Con
necticut many years a o. At the time of
receiving the letter Mr. Rice was recover
ing from an accident that necessitated the
amputation 01 a leg. Having plenty of
leisure time he decided to open up a cor-
spondence with his unknown and un
remembered relative in Spain.
After several letters had passed Mr.
Rice laid the whole matter before the
Spanish Consul in San Francisco, and on
comparing notes both were convinced a
desperate system of swindling was being
practiced that embraced both fraud and
murder.
"I received the first letter from Spain,"
said Mr. Rice 10-day, "a few months ago,
and after I read it 1 did considerable
thinking. The writer referred to me and
my family in very familiar terms and
stated that we were related. I did not
seem to recollect the name, but as there
are lots of Rices in the district where I
was brought up I thought possible that I
might have forgotten at least one. He
recalled certain scenes in Connecticut,
where my family came from, and so at
first I concluded that the letter might
really be from some forgotten relative.
"ify friend then went on to detail bow !
he had left home in Connecticut many
years ago and had gone to sea. He fol- j
lowed a roamins life for several years and
finally drifted into Spain, where, he tells
inc. he married. All this happened years
ago, and now he is in trouble with a beau
tiful daughter 14 years of age on his hands.
He tails me her name is Rosa, and that
she is at present in a Catholic school near
Malaga. Evidently things matrimonial
do not always run smoothly in Spain, for
my distant friend has Had trouble witn
his wife, who is at present in Madrid.
"He then proceeded to tell me of his
trouble, but did not say. exactly what it
consisted of, but he assured me that his
estate wai in danger. I was rather sur
prised, but I answered his letter and told
him 1 would like to know more of him and
his family troubie;. I told him that 1
could not remember now, but that if I
knew more, perhaps I could recall him.
"Hi- next letter was more of a surprise j
than his first. He said his circumstances |
were such that it had become absolutely
necessary for him to pnt bis estate into
the hands of others, and said he would
sooner transfer it to me than anybody
else. He said that this would be done if I
would taKe care of Rosa until she should
come of age. I wrote tbat I would do all
in my power to help his daughter if he
arranged matters so that she should be no
c-xnense to me.
- "In reply to this letter my friend sent ,
me two photographs. One was ot himself >
and the other was of Rosa. They were
pictures of people wbo seemed to be very
intelligent and respectable and were
taken in a Spanish city. Tnis letter also
told me that the money he was anxious to
entrust to me amounted to $GO,COO. which
he bad placed already in an English con
corn ior me to use for Rosa.
"He stated that he had made arrange
ments to send Rosa across the ocean in
company with a Catholic priest whenever
1 stated that I was ready to receive her.
I replied that I was preparing for her re
ception and that she should be well cared
for.
â¢ "The next letter was a doleful one. My
alleged friend told me that he bad sud
denly been arrested and locked up in
prison. He said it was fonunaie that his
money was out of his band, as he would
have lost all had he still b en in possession
of it when arrested. He greatly regretted
that he was unab c to send Rosa owing to
the lack of the necessary funds. He had
neglected to leave out even enough for
expenses, and the British law compelled
the payment of a certain tax on the trans
fers of property. After reciting his
troubles he concluded by stating that
$2200 was necessary for this purpose, and
asking if I could lei him have thai amount,
which I could take out of his estate when
it had been transferred to me.
"At this stage of the game I began to
be suspicious. Things were decidedly in
teresting, so I went to San Francisco and
laid the whole matter before the Spanish
Consul. After I had concluded my story
tbe Consul said I was a lucky man.
'â¢He then told me that the affair was a
gigantic fraud and that this was the
second case that had been brought to bis
notice."
"These letters from alleged relatives in
Spanish prisons are a new system of
fraud,", said the Spanish Consul. "Some
time a o a farmer who resi ed near Wa
ters received just the same kind of letters
and telling just the same story .> The poor
fellow at Winters believe m the sincerity
of his correspondent and was at last per
suaded to sell his farm so that he might
go to his relative's aid In that case the
girl was 14 and a Catholic priest was to
bring her over." -
The Consul assured Mr. Rice that th
man would certainly be killed and never
heard o again if he ever, set foot in the
Span sh town he started for on any such
errand. He advised the Hay wards, man
to have nothing more to do with the man
in Spain.
"I made up my mind to have some
more satisfaction witli the ". fellow." said
Mr. Rice, "and so I wrote to him again,
telling him that owing to improvements

Mr. Ilice has unearthed another phase
of the plot. He is convinced that there is
an accomplice at this end of the swindle,
who shadows the p ospective victim.

ANNEXATION ELECTION.
The Matter Will Kh Decided at the
Polls Next Month.
OAKLAND. Cal.. April 16.â In about
six weeks there will be a special election
to determine the annexation of the north
ern territory. A revised and corrected pe
tition has been prepared for submission
to the Council, and it shows that since the
original petition was circulated there has
been a growth of sentiment in favor of
! annexation.
'There are several new features to this
annexation scheme," said Secretary Nai
smith to-day, "and they all tend to favor
annexation. I cannot give the figures at
this lime, but we have many more names
on the new petition than were on the old
one. There is also a feeling of unrest in
Emeryville at present. Ii is a compara
tively easy matter to run tho government
of that little town during the racing sea
son, when all the saioon* are doing a
good business and paying good licenses,
but on May 15 the racing season will
close, and for the sue ceding six months
there will be no ousiness in the town.
This has caused many of the residents to
think, and those east of the racetrsck are
now of the opinion that thoy had better
be part of Oakland than part of a town
whose existence is doubtful."
FATE OF JIM HUNTER.
Becked a Horse With His Life
and Then Bought an Ounce
of Laudanum.
G^d Bus Lost the Race ani His
Owner Is Probably Dead on the
Buiks of a Creek.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 16. J
Jim Hunter Is missing, and if he has
carried out his threat he is now lying dead
in some secluded part of the creek that
runs near the racetrack.
James Hunter is one of the best known
renters of stalls at the track. He is not
prominent on account of his wealth or
because of the number of prizes bis horse
has won. He has no wealth, but was the
owner of a horse called Gold Bu- . For
several years Hunter and his friend, Joe
Krause, have bsen going around the cir
cuits with Gold Bug. The horse has won
a few good race* and kept his owners in
funds. This luck had bad effect on Hun
ter and he took to the bottle.
This last year has not been particularly
lucky. Hunter and' Krause called the
horse their meal-ticket, but they went
hungry many times. The day before '.
Christmas Gold Buz proved tbat he de
served his name. He won a purse of $350
! from a field of fifteen horses. Hunter
; turned over a new leaf, swore off drinking j
and got his affairs in good shape. Since
that time, however, the meal-ticket has
produced nothing to eat.
Yesterday Gold Bug was entered in a
race. Hunter declared that unless he won
it would be the last race he would ever see
his horse run. Hunter stood near the in
closure and said: "I have made up my
mind that if Gold Bug loses to-day I will
kill myself."
Gold Bug lost the race and about 4
o'clock Hunter left the track, eiving bis
badge to a, friend, remarking: "Take this.
I will never need it again."
A little later Hunter went to Westlake's
drugstore in Emeryville .and purchased
an ounce of laudanum, which he said be
wanted for liniment for his horse.
After leaving the drugstore nothing is
known of Hunter. His partner. Krause.
is confident that the broken-down horse
man went \to some secluded spot and
drank the laudanum and that he is now
lying dead, having carried out his threat
to die if his horse lost. â :.-' A

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 17, 1897.
HIRAM TUBBS
QUITS BUSINESS
Prominent Half a Century
in Commercial
' Life.
His Career Is an Active Chapter
in the History of
the State.
With Old Age Creeping On He Trans
fers All Pew r ;o His Son
Herman.
. â  â .- â¢- â â â 
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, Apr.l 16. )
The recording of a little document this
afternoon indicates that one of the men
who has been most actively identified with
commercial interests on this coast since
1855 has completed his active career.
The paper is a simple power of attorney
given by Hiram Tubbs to his son, Her
man. Hiram Tubbs is at present at his
home in East Oakland suffering from old
age and many of the ills attendant
thereto. He is gradually growing weaker
in physique, and during tho past few
weeks has had several attacks of sickness
from which his recovery has been doubt
ful.
For nearly half a century the name of
Hiram Tubbs has been among the fore
most merchants of California, and in* this
city, where he has made his home nearly
all that time, the name of Tubbs is in
separable from local history.
Hiram Tubbs is now 73 years of age and
has been an active merchant since be was
20. He came to this coast in 1855 with his
wife, who was Miss Susan Ant. Maniels of
Massachusetts, and arrived in San Fran
cisco by the steamer Tennessee, which
was wrecked outside tie Oeldrr. Gate, but
without loss of life. Mr. Tubbs* broiher,
Alfred, was engaged in the ship-chandlery
business when Hiram arrived, and he at
once joined his brother in the firm, which
1 was known late in 1855 as Tubbs & Fuller.
I In this year Mr. Politer withdrew, and.
since that time the business has been in
| the hands of ihe Tubbses.
In 1355 Hiram Tubbs went East and
i bought machinery for manufacturing
I cordate cf all kind*. Until 1875 Flint,
[ Peabody & Co. were interested in the en
terprise, but for the past twenty-fire years
the concern has been known as the Tubbs
Cordage Company.
Many years ago Mr. Tubbs built the
celebrated Tubbs Hotel at East Oakland.
For a long time it was the chief resort of
active and retired miners on this coast.
But its days of glory had passed 'before it
was burned down five years ago.
Mr. Tubbs also owned the adjoining
block around the hotel lot, and on three
of the lots his married daughters now re
side. He also is the owner of large tracts
of land on Sonoma Creek, in Sonoma
County, besides having large interests
around the bay. 7 A
Mr. Tubbs is the father of nine children,
*even of whom are living ana prominent
in social circles on both sides of the .bay.
Two of nia daughters are married to Wil
liam G. Henshaw and bis brother, Fred
"W. Henshaw, Supreme Justice of Califor
nia, Another daughter is married to
Everett M. Grimes and these three fam
ilies are all neighbors of the Tubbs man
sion in East Oakland.
Hiram Tubbs is an old member of Cali
fornia Commandery No. 1, K. T., and
throughout bis long and active life he has
been characterized by marked generosity
to his children and grandchildren, being
opposed to the old conservative system of
retnining his property as long as he lived,
and then willing it to his children. He
has given them the opportunity of enjoy
ing their shares as soon as they showed
they were capable of handling it judi
ciously.
No Hope of Harmony.
OAKLAND. Cal., April 16.â An effort
is being made to cause Rev. A. M. LeVeau

fer to each other's debts and other small
matters and betray confidences, proving
that the church is hopelessly divided.

TWO FAVORITES
FINISHED FIRST
The Bookmakers Again
Reap a Harvest at
Emeryville.
Peril Decamped With the Open
ing Sprint at Odds of
-A 15 to 1.
Howard, a Favorite, Left al the Post.
Torsida Scored Again â Msrcutio
First at 10 to 1.
! Good guessers at Emeryville yesterday
picked up a few stray bets, but they were
in the minority, and the bookmakers
again mended any new-found fracture/ in
their bank rolls. The game is getting to
be a trifle rusty, and horses do not run up
to form as of yore, neither do certain
jockeys ride with the same old snap and
vigor. Favorites in the betting fell by the
wayside again, two only passing the stand
first. Of the outsiders. Peril at 15 to 1 was
the loneest-priced winner.
Backers of first choices get a delight
fully breezy run for their money in the
opening event, a furlong run. The
starters numbered fourteen, and after
Peril, Miss Gentry, Potentate and Quick
silver had delayed the start for over fif
teen minutes, Ferguson sent tbem away
with Howard, the favorite, left at the post.
Peril then won easily from Quicksilver,
with Pat Murphy taking the show.
Showing up well at her previous appear
ance with the colors up, the Burns &
Waterhouse entry, Delia M, was backed
to 2 to 1 favoritism to win the two-year-old
scramble and she did it very cleverly.
Slaughter kept the filly back in the bunch
until straightened for the wire, when be
made his move and finished over a length
before Twinkler at the wire, doing the
four furlongs in 50'<Â£ seconds.
Farrar& Tuberville's mare Lena, against
which 4 to 1 was laid, made a runaway
race of the mile selling affair. Clawson
took her out in front at the start and she
rolled in, with O'Fleetaat 15 to 1 taking
the place. Little Bob, the favorite*, came
on from tbe rear, finishing third.
It seemed as though the combined powers
bet their coin on Torsida to win the sec
ond two-year-old sprint, and the filly's
friends cashed. Backed down from 6to 5
to evens, she passed the wire two lengths
before The Cheat, the second choice in the
ring. Miss Dividend, a3oto 1 shot, was a
good third.
Sandy McNaughton had one of bis cele
brated "Derby preps" on Judge Denny,
and the proud stepping black horse
stepped off a merry mile and a furlong.
The event was fifth on the card, and Per
seus ruled a 9 to 5 choice around post
time. /^t36nP9Bf ftyflÃ?-'Â«j
Purser's gelding raced with Denny to
the stretch, where the black one began
drawing away and at the wire won clev
erly three parts of a length in front of
Morte Fonse in I:s4>_. Addie Buchanan
took show honors.
The stable connections thought Alma
good enough to win the concluding six
furlong sprint, and she faced the webbing
a 2 to 1 favorite. Prominent up to the
last furlong the filly tired and was un
placed. In a drive Snider got Mercutio, a

NOTES.
Johnny Weber, the well-known heavy,
weight, rider, is now in the employ of
Barney Schreiber. <â , Johnny is without an
equal in petting horses away Irom the post.
Mike Hennessy was fined $-5 by the
judge, for hot,- keeping his position at the
barrier with Tor i la. Bob Isom was taxed
a similar amount ior the same offense on
Thursday.
Dalion, which looked to have a great
chance in the first two-year-old scramble,
was jumped on by one of the other start
ers and pulled up lame. '.-A* â¢
It was rumored around the track that
the sprinter Jim Bozeman had been raced
with shoes on instead of the usual plates.
After the races were over Judge Murphy
and President Williams journeyed down
to the paddock where the horse's feel were
examined, He was found to bo shod with
rather heavy training plates, but it Is not
bought any fraud was intended. '..
' Harry and Jess Hoffman, the book
makers, left for Chicago last evening, ac
companied by their wive.".
Derfargilla is now owned by Barney
j Schreiber. The St. Louis pen'ciler bet
$1000 against tbe mare the other day on a
I close decision, so the story goes, and his
eyesight proved best.
A little can of kerosene, a scrubbinc
brush and 35 cents' worth of , clock oil
might prove beneficial in the timers'
stand. Capable timers on the outside
made the time for the first race 1:15 flat,
instead of 1:16% as hung out.
* That recall-hag rule, in force at Emery
ville or not in lorce as the occasion re-
I quires, appears to bave much elasticity
| about it. It is, indeed, a pleasurable fea
ture of racing, one tbat makes a speculator
feel like purchasing a racetrack cigar and
then try to bulldoze a policeman to see
two or three "crabs" which should be j
barred from starting perform all sorts of
crazy antics at the post and then be sent
away in front â with the favorite left.
According to the rule, it looks as though ,
the backers of Howard bad a "kick".com
ing.
Pedro Enos said after. the last race that
he would have won with Lost Girl had
the fitly not made a stumble about three
furlongs from home, losing several lengths.'

HOW NOT TO GET OFFICE.
Mutual Disgust of President McKinley and
Eli Denison, Though From Far
.- , Different Causes.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 16.â Eli
Denison of Oakland left here a sadder but
a wiser man. He is utterly disgusted and
feels that he made a long transcontinental
trip for nothing. Senator Perkins could
not give him any encouragement, as
Frank Leach had already been decided on
for the mint superinteridoncy. But Sen
ator Perkins fed Eli a little taffy. He
took him to the White House and gave
him a look at the President. This is all
Eli will get.
When the President entered his office
this morning he found such a large con
gregation awaiting him that for the first
time he plainly exhibited impatience and
expressed a desire to be excused from
undergoing the impending ordeal. The
crown was made up mostly of Senators
and Representatives, many of whom were
accompanied by friends and constituents
whom they desired to personally present
to the President.
Applicants for office seemed imbued
with the notion that a personal presenta
tion to the President by the Senators and
Representatives will further their chances
for appointment, and many of tbem per
sist in handing their papers to the Presi
dent, declining to follow the advice of
their sponsors to send their papers to the
department under which appointments
are sought. Except in a few cases, when the
applicants are well known to the Pres.
dent, these personal visits and appeals do
no good whatever, and, as a rule, annoy
the President and simply consume valu
able time to no purpose. Of the hundreds
of applicants who call daily, it is risking
little to say that he does not remember a
tenth of. them or their appeals one hour
after their disappearance from his pres
ence. . 7'pAAA â¢'*. 7-7 :
Applicants might as well save their
time and money in coming to Washing
ton and trust their cases to Senators and
Representatives. It is a great mistake to
suppose that the President receiv s and
examines the papers filed by applicants
for appointment to office. Some of these
are prepared with great care and at con
siderable expense, and their owners be
lieve if they can have the opportunity to
take them to the White House in person
the President will certainly be attracted
by their, elegant style and bulk and will
give them personal attention. No papers
of this character are ever looked at by the
President. Nor are the papers which are
addres ed to him, no matter how con
veyed or marked, laid before him until
the particular case is taken up. All pa
pers recived at the White House are
taken by the clerks and immediately sent
to the departments to which they prop
erly belong.
There they are briefed and filed to await
the action of the President and Secreiary,
when tbey get ready to take up the par
ticular appointment to which they, relate.
These facts are known to Senators and
Representatives/but the average appli
cant will 1 not be convinced, and insists
upon coming to Washington and, under
the convoy of his Senator or Representa
tive,-calling in person upon the President.
It can be confidently slated that the
President is becoming very weary of these
daily visitors, and it is probable that ha
will be compelled shortly, in self-defense,
to make a rule declining to see any appli
cants for office except those invited to
meet him.
. This morning he sent word to the throng
that was waiting for his appearance that
he would like to be excused that he might
be permute-- to devote a morning to im
portant public business, but this appeal
did not save him. A number of .Senators
and Representatives gave heed" and de
parted, but the bulk o. them remained,
each declaring that he desired to occupy
the President but a minute. \

A FELON'S STRIPES
FOR NICK BRENNAN
Convicted of Extorting
Money From Theresa
Tarpey.
Judpe Wallace Refused a Trial
With Closed Doors for the
Public Good. . :
~V
Deputy District Attorney Black Com
mented on the Hideous Depravity
of the Prisoner.
In Judge Wallace's court yesterday
Nicholas Brennan was convicted of send
ing a letter to Miss Theresa Tarpey for
the purpose of extorting money from her.
The case attracted wide attention on
account of the remarkable depravity of
the defendant as disclosed in his letters to
the victim of his passions.
Brennan comes of a respectable family,
and all his relatives are prosperous, while
the parents of Miss Tarpey, now dead,
came into court bowed with age and bear
ing the stamp of penury, if not of poverty.
The testimony indicated that the poor
girl's lowly condition in life and the fact
that she was compelled to work away
from home at a tender age led to the cir-
cumstances which put her under Bren
nan's control, and made her, as Deputy
District Attorney Black informed * the
jury, "his mere chattel and devoted
slave."
During the trial Brennan maintained a
bold front and smiled derisively as the
testimony of the girl, taken before the
committing magistrate, was read to the
jury. He did not appear to appreciate the
enormity of the charges against him, for
the matter of extortion was the mildest of
the three counts formally presented. A
charge of criminal assault was dismissed
some time ago on habeas corpus proceed
ings, but there is yet pending a charge of
inducing a female to enter a disreputable
house.
Judge Wallace refused to allow the case
to be tried with closed doors, for the
reason that he thought if such things are
possible in this City the public has a right
to know or them and take warning.
Brennan has been surrounded by in
fluential friends from the time of his ar
rest, and apparently had no doubt of ac
quittal. He maintained an air of brag
gadocio up to the moment that the ver
dict of guilty was announced and Deputy
Sheriff U her slipped the steel gyves on
his wrists, and then for the first time the
convicted felon turned rale.
In the morning session Brennan took
the witness-stand in his own behalf and
denied tne allegations of assault and of
inducing the girl to re-ort to immorality.
Deputy District Attorney A. if. Black
addressed tbe jury, earnestly, but briefly.
He read the letter which Brennan sent to
Miss Tarpey, and said it was the most
brutal epistle that he ever saw. H ask-d
that justice be met.d out to this villain,
who had disgraced the name of manhood.
Brennan is a vigorous, athletic young
fellow, and she was a poor, weak, con
sumptive girl, under 18 years of age, yet
he threatened â to use his own horrible
words â "to kick the stuffing out of her,"
and by so doing he extorted from her the
money that she gave him.
The jury was asked to consider only the
charge of extortion at tbis time. The alle
gations in the dead girl's testimony in re
gard to any outrage that Brennan bad
committed upon her, and that he bad
forced her into a vile house where he com
pelled her to receive the visits of China
men, would be inquired into at another
time.
Attorney E. L. Forster, representing the
defendant, made an able and logical argu
ment, presenting the defense of his client
in the strongest possiole light. Every in
cident that could be considered as favor
able to the defendant was stated by Mr.
Forster in a forcible manner.
Mr. Black responded in a few words.
He said that he regretted the tears of
Brennan's relatives, but the jurors must
do their sworn duty. In some communi
ties the populace would not be bo patient
as to await the verdict of ' a jury in such a
.case. He thought the tears of Theresa
Tarpey ought also to be remembered.
Judge Wallace delivered a succinct
charge to the jury, and ten minutes later
a verdict of guilty as charged was returned.
Brennan was conducted to a felon's cell in
the City Hall basement. He will be sen
tenced next Friday.
THE POTBERO IS PLEASED.
Abolition of Battler Test and Other
Improvements llalle-d With Joy.
Ownors of property in the Potrero and I
on the Southern Heights are more than !
pleased at the abolition of the Rattler test
for macadamizing rock for the streets in i
their section. This will give them a !
chance to improve their streets without
being compelled to haul rock from the {
Twin Peaks.
' To the Real Estate and Development
Company and Potrero Land Improvement
Company the abolition of the ordinance
means much, as these companies have in i
the past and now have in prospect the !
opening of several streets through sec- i
tions which heretofore only existed on the
official map. : : ijJ , .Vf'X 'JVf.
With the Rattler test removed, the blue
rock that had been tabooed will now.be
used in macadamizing streets and side- I
walks, thereby giving an impetus to a J
general line of improvements in the en- |
tire section. ,
By to-morrow night the grading of |
Twenty-second street will be completed i
to Pennsylvania avenue. This grading
covers a distance of three blocks and has
necessitated a fill of . about 25.000 cubic
yards of earth to bring it up to the official i
grade and complete a perfectly level road i
from Kentucky street to Pennsylvania '
aveme.
In addition to this cause of joy the resi- i
dents are pleased with the promptness in
which the bprlng Valley Water Company I
has moved in placing a reservoir on the
summit of the Southern Heights. A gang
of laborers has started already to clean
away the crown of the bill preparatory. to
the company putting down its steel tank,
out of which an abundance of water will
be supplied.
The prospect of bavin< the West Shore
Railroad running throng that tract of the
City, as outlined in yesterday's Call,
added still more joy to their hearts,
as the proposed line will skirt 7 off the
shore line close to Spreckels' sugar re
finery, thereby giving an opening' to the
adjoining county, which, with the near
completion ... of Railroad avenue, from
Eighteenth avenue to the Five-mile
House, will * tend to . bring tbe ; once de
spised and forlorn. Potrero nil Is into their
proper importance as comprising the
chief manufacturing section of the City.

WU WITH THE CONVERTS.
The Minister Spend* an Evening at the
A77 '-'â¢--â¢ Chinese Mission. 7Â«AA'7
Wu Tint; Fans, the new Chinese Min
ister who is en route to Washington, was
the guest of the Christian Chinese Mis
sions Inst night at a reception given at
the - Presbyterian Chinese Church on
Stockton street,' near CJay.
Commodious as this house of worship is
it could not contain half of the people
who wanted to get in to see and hear the
most distinguished Embassador that
China has yet sent to America. The in
terior oi the church had been handsomely
decorated with flowers, lanterns ana flaps
in honor of the event. Naturally the great
\ bulk of the attendance was made up of
| Chinese, but there were enough Cauca
sians there to show that it was not in
tended to be a strictly race affair.
The reception consisted of an address of
welcome by Rev. If. J. Masters, vocal
solos and prayer. Mr. Wu was presented
during the evening with two elegantly
bound Bibles one * for himself and the
other for Mrs. Wu.
The Minister expressed creat gratitude,
not only for the pifis but for the welcome
and attention accorded him. He said be
hoped that during his stay in America be
would succeed in further cemeting the
bona of friendship that exists between
China and America. Then, turning to the
Chinese in the audi.nce, he addressed
them in their native tongue. ! Bis advice
was that the)* be strictly law-abiding
while residing under the American flag,
for that was the only way in which tbe
respect of the people of this country could
be retained. He cautioned them particu
larly against engaging in disgraceful fac
tional feuds.
SOME APRICOTS LEFT
The Santa Clara Crop Not a
Failure as Has Been
Reported.
Considerable Damage Done by tbe
Frosts, but Not Enough to Dis
courage th? Growers.
There has been quite a scare on among
the big fruitmen for some days past on
account of the reported failure of the
banta Clara apricot crop.
Reports' are commit in now, however,
from the cied district which indicate
that the havoc caused by the late frosts,
followed by the hot sp?ll, will not reach
such proportions as was feared. It ap
pears now that it was really only the early
varieties known as the Blenheims and the
Royals that were seriously damaged and
will show short crops. The Moorpark
variety, however, â¢ which constitutes the
bulk of the apricots grown in Santa Clara
County, practically escaped injury and
will yield quite heavily after all. On the
who c the apricot crop of that county will
be an average one.
Santa Clara's almonds have been con
siderably damaged, but still not enough to
call the crop a total failure.
Early reports were to the effect that the
apricots of Fresno and Kings counties
were completely wiped out, but tnese also
prove to have been exaggerated. The
damage done that way was heavy, but not
such as to completely discourage the fruit
growers.
"The late news we have been receiving
from those counties affected by the frost is
indeed encouraging," said the* manager of
the Porter Bros. Company yesterday. "It
looked for a while as though there was
going to be a heavy shrinkage in the
apricot crop, but 1 am happy to say that
conditions have changed. We will have
just about an average crop."

RETURNS TO
THE FAITH OF
HIS YOUTH
Dr. Williams, Congrega
tionalism Becomes an
Episcopalian.
A SURPRISE FOR HIS OLD
ASSOCIATES.
Plymouth's Late Pastor Con
firmed by Bishop Nichols at ,
a Private Service.
STATES HIS REASONS IN A
LETTER TO THE CALL.
Sys There Is No RÂ°al Difference in
ihe Articles of Faith, but Ha
Likes the Liturgy.
The Rev. W. D. Williams, who six
weeks ago resigned from the ) a3torate of
lhe Plymouth Congregational Church,
has surprised those with whom he has so
long been associated in his religious work
by renouncing the Congregational and
REV. W. D. WILLIAMS, Who Has Renounced the Congrega
tional for the Episcopal Church.
joining the Episcopal church. Tbe cere
mony of confirmation was performed pri
vately by Bishop Nichols â where and
when Dr. Williams refuses to state. The
reason for so declining, he says, is that
the ceremony being private, with only a
few persons present, be does not feel that
he is at liberty to mention the time, al
though, he says, a proper time was allowed
to pass after leaving the Plymouth Church.
The whole matter was intended to be
kept secret for some time, but it* leaked
out and seems to have taken the officers
and members of his old church entirely
by surprise, as they were given no intima
tion of his intention in this regard.
Dr. Williams will leave with his family
for his old home at Oberlin, Ohio, where
he intends to put his .-liter to school.
He has no definite plans for the imme
diate future, he says, except that be shall
engage in religious literary work and ul
timately enter the Episcopal ministry.
He has made no application for examina
tion for such orders as yet.
There are three steps necessary to be
taken in order to become a priest of the
church, each one of which is ordinarily
separated by six months â that of a postu
lant, then a deacon, and then a priest.
In his case, however, a man of his years
and experience, Dr. Williams says, might
accomplish the three examinations in one
and within a month's time. However, he
says, he has not fully determined upon
making the application. The following
is a statement prepared by Dr. Williams
himself, giving his reasons for taking the
step he has:
In response to the request of The Call I beg
to say: Â
In entering the Protestant Episcopal church
many persons, not well informed in ecclesias
tical changes and exchanges, may think a
very unusual circumstance has transpired.
But there isa large and increasing influx of
communicants from the various denomina
tions into that church, and it is estimated
that one-third of its clergy were once minis
ters in other evangelical bodies. It must also
be evident to the observing that there is in
nearly all denominations a strong liturgical
trend, illustrated in the willing and increas
ing use in public service of the Lord's Prayer,
the Apostles' Creed, responsive readings,
chants and te deums. There is also increased
attention to the celebrations of the Christian
Church, such as Christmas, Passion Week,
Easter and Whitsuntide. These external signs
are to the inner aspirations or convictions

what the pointers on tlie dial of a clock are to
the worts within.
In childhood in England we attended a
j "church school," and there obtained impres
sions which in subsequent years have re-
I curred from time to time with increasing
j force. They have been influential In prompt
ing us to meditation and research along his
torical and doctrinal lines. Our impressions
have deepened into convictions. We have
I ereatly enjoyed and we have been divinely
j blessed in our Congregational fellowship; it
is a deservedly honored denomination, whose
welfare shall ever be our prayerful concern.
By comparison there is, doctrinalty, no essen
tial difference between Congregationalism and
! the Protestant Episcopal church. In forms of
j worship the difference is lessening. An Epis
i copal clergyman, formerly a prominent Con
! gregational pastor, remarked to the writer:
! "With increasing delight and satisfaction I
J use and am supported by the system and
â¢ methods of the church. lam not aware that
anything of value in Cengregationalism has
been lost to mo by the change. "
But while the testimony of others, the incli
nations of taste, the marked liturgical trend of
the age, and the impressions of childhood
might constitute a sufficient cause for enter
ing the Protestant Episcopal church, never
. theless we have come slowly and prayerfully
to that step, and for the following reasons :
Firstâ Because Christ founded his church.
To that church he refers, Matt. xviii:l7, and
there states for all coming time the initial
steps of church government.
Secondâ Because he promised that the
church should forever continue, "and the
gates of hell shall not prevail against i;." His
promise has not failed. The church has con
tinued, and lis continuance, amid all the mv
' tations of empires, is a supernatural and gra
cious marvel. The promise was a revelation
j and a prophecy.
Thirdâ Because Christ teaches that the
I church is nis body, an organism, of which he
I is the head. Only the very lowest forms of
j animal life can exist when severed into sepa
! rate parts. The higher the life the more
1 vitally related to the whole is every part.
Fourthâ Christ committed to his church the
two ordinancesâ baptism and the Lord's Sup
per. They, with the observance of the Lord's
day, have been sacredly preserved by this
holy organism through all the changing cen
turies, even as they are gratefully by all evan
gelical Christians.
Filthâ He Instituted the ministry. "He
gave some apostles, and some prophets, and
some evangelists, and .some pastors and teach
ers lor the perfecting of the saints, for the
work of the ministry, for the edifying of the
body of Chris I"â Ephes. iv:ll- 1*2. The
New Testament and church history unite in
teaching that there were three orders in the
ministry, called in the Bible, apostles, eiders
or presbyters, and deacons, and afterward
called Bishops, presbyters and deacons.
Sixthâ He invested nis church with author
ity. Believing that the Protestant Episcopal
church gathers into itself all the above ele
ments of origin, continuity and authority, and
believing it to be historically 1 ontinuous from
Christ and the Apostles through the ancient
British church; and believing it to be equally
evangelical with any denomination and that
its spirit is thoroughly cathode aud progres
sive, we have chosen to enter its fellowship.
Our transition will be more amply described
and the reasons more clearly given in a
pamphlet soon to be issued. Meanwhile, witn
continued regard for all, 1 am, very sin
cerely, W. D. Williams.
BALDWIN'S BIG BORROW.
The Hibernia Bank Loans Him
Eighty-Five Thousand
Dollars.
Now * Owes the Institution Over a
M llion and a Hilf on His
Property.
E. J. Baldwinâ Lucky Baldwinâ hotel
man and horserace., is either in luck be
cause he is able to borrow so much or out
of luck because compelled to ask heavy
loans; but at any rate he appears to be on
both sides of the proposition.
Within a comparatively short time he
has borrowed over a million and a half of
dollars, and yesterday he added to the
total by getting $85,000 from the Hibernia
I Savings and Loan Society. To secure
this large amount he gave a blanket
mortgage on the Baldwin Hotel, on the
annex to the hostelry, on his residence
property on California street, near Jones,
on property on Webster and Fell streets,
on Stevenson-street property and on his
big real estate holdings in Los Angeles
city and county.
Another document filed transferred to
the Hibernia Bank all the rents and other
incomes of his various properties to secure
interest and the mortgage itself. This
loan makes a total of $1,670,000 owing the
Hibernia Savings and Loan Society.
Several months ago Baldwin concen-
I trated the incumbrances on his big hold
j ings into a single blanket mortgage, which
i was taken up by the bant mentioned.
It is said that his necessity for so large
. an amount of ready money is that he is
I engaged in a vast irrigation scheme in the
j southern part of the State, and that he
j anticipates immense , returns from -thia
I when tie system is in working order. It
; is also stated that bis racing stable has
I not been productive of much profit during
I the past few years.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 17, 1897.
THAT '96 ROLL
WAS NOT STUFFED
Result of the Inquiry by
the Grand Jury Into
Census Matters.
Hew Director Waller . and Mar
shal Wardell Jumped at
Conclusions.
The Indictment of Dr. F. H. Stahle
for Embezzlement Was Filed in
Courtâ F led at $2000
The Grand Jury went into Judge Sea
well's court yesterday afternoon and pre
sented an indictment charging Dr. F. H.
Stnhle, ex-superintendent of the City and
County Hospital, with embezzlement. On
motion of Assistant District Attorney
Hinkle a b.uch warrant for the arrest of
Dr. Stahle was issued and the bail in the
case fixed at $2000. The indictment voted
upon last Tuesday and presented to the
court yesterday is the outcome of the in
vestigation concerning Dr. Stahle's man
agement of the hospital. The testimony
submitted to the Grand Jury was to the
effect that Dr. Stahle ) urchased expensive
lurniture to equip his quarters at the City
institution and then upon his removal
from office took away to his own residence
furniture which belonged to the City.
An investigation of a charge that the
school census roll of 1896 had been stuffed
was begun by the Grand Jury yesterday
afternoon. The charges or insinuations
emanated from School Director Waller
and James Ward. ll, the present Census
Marshal, but the investigation was de
manded by W. W. Bausman, the Census
Marshal from 1802 until 1896.
Waller and otber newly fledged mem
bers of the Board of Education joined
Wardell in a superficial inspection of the
roll of 1606 and jumped at tbe conclusion
that 71,822 school children between the
aires of 5 and 17 year? could not have been
actually enrolled. According to Warden's
testimony names obtained by sending out
blanks to the schools, and names obtained
directly by the deputies in the progress of
canvassing were duplicated.
Considerable hubbub was made in the
Board of Education and also in one of the
morning newspapers over this discovery,
but when the Grand Jury sent, at Mr.
Bausman's request, for the held block
book, the comparison book and canvass
ing book of 1606, the sensation was uuickly
exploded. It was shown so conclusively
that only additions had been made and
that no duplications had been entered,
that the Grand Jury at once decided that
ibe inquiry should be laid on tbe table
until Marshal Warden completed the en
rollment for 1897.
Wardell presumably found the name of
John Blank's family twice on the roll and
jumped at the conclusion that there had
oeen stuffing. Mr. Bausman told the
Grand Jury that it frequently happened
that a Deputy Marshal would go to a
house and get the names only of the chil
dren attending school. He would return
his list with two children accredited to
Jonn Blank's residence. No. 1000, on
street t-o-and-so. In regular order John
Blank would get, through one of his chil
dren attending school, the return blank
sent to the schoolhouse, and would prob
ably enumerate two more children of the
family not attending school, or four in
all. In due course ot time, when the re
turn blanks were classified nnd blocked
for comparison, the deputy's report for
that block, street and number would be
compared with the return blank, and the
record would be corrected by adding "two
children" to John Blank, 1000 street So
and-so.
The combined Wardell and Waller in
tellect was not equal to a comprehension
of such an accurate but simple method of
enumeration and therefore the cry of
frmid was raised.
Wardell made a poor showing when
questioned by the Grand Jury yesterday.
The fact was brought out that he has
sixty-eight deputies to assist him. whereas
Bausman had ouly forty-eight in 1886.
According to the last registration and
vote of San Francisco, and in proportion
to the known population of the City, there
should be at least 76,000 children between
the ages of 5 and 17. Even this is far be
low the proportion found in many coun
ties of tbe interior.
The number reported in 1896â iÂ«,
71,822 â indicated only an increase of 1800
over that of 1895. In 1893 the number of
census children enumerated was 65,317.
Following the rule that the population
should be four and one-half times more
than the number of census children, the
enrollment ot 71,822 names in 1896 indi
cated a population of 323,199.
Everyone familiar with the growth of
San Francisco knows that the enrollment
is below rather than above the actual
number of children entitled to enrollment.
It is regretted by the Grand Jury tbat
statements have been sent broadcast to
the people of the State tbat the San Fran
cisco school authorities had stuffed the
census roll in order to obtain a larger
share of the State school money than the
actual number of children warranted.
San .Francisco annually pays into the
Stale treasury a very much larger sum of
money on school tax account than is re
ceived in return by the process of appor
tionment. The law which requires the
census to be taken between April 15 and
30ih of each year, may give ample time
for enrollment of school children in rural
towns ips, but the time is not adequate
for canvassing the City and making the
proper recount.
It was disclosed in Mr. Bausman's testi
mony yesterday that forty deputies would
be sufficient provided the Census Marshal
had authority to engage capable and ex
perienced deputies. As the patronage is
now distributed each director in the Board
of Education hands the Marshal a list of
so many persons to be employed, and
many of the men on the lists so furnished
are ignorant or inefficient.
It was distinctly brought out by the in
vestigation yesterday that Ex-Marshal
Bausman was paid a certain sum per day
for his work and that his compensation
Could not be increased by stuffing tho roll.
It is the opinion of the Grand Jury that
Wardell, with his sixty-eight deputies,
should go to work diligently and enroll
all the children between the ages of five
and seventeen. If the work can be done
as it should De no less than 70,000 child ren
will be reported. That number would in
dicate the population of San Francisco to
be 342,000.
In the Eastern States population is reck
oned by multiplying by six the number of
votes cast. Should San Francisco adopt
this ratio a population of 420,000 could be
claimed.
Aurelius E. Buckingham, chairman of
the committee on tax collector ; and
license collector, submitted a report yes
terday to the whole, body of the Grana
Jury. Expert' Robert Colly more shows
that in the years from 1884 to 1893, inclu
sive, there were sold 13,597 i pieces of prop
erty at delinquent tax sates and 5846 were
redeemed during that time, leaving 7751
Pieces of real estate in tax-buyers' hands.
It is suggested that the tax sales con
tained in fifty volumes be condensed into
one volume. It would be a great saving
on the wear and tear of the books; also
time and labor. â¢j^Bga9_-ES-___gg'Ba^aÃi__*-__--i

MRS. MAISON OBJECTS.
Sue* M. H. de Young, iditor of the
Chronicle, for 850,000
for Libel.
Mrs. Maria Theresa Maison by her at
torney, W. W. Foote, has sued M. 11. de
Young for $50,000 damages for libel. The
complaint states that on the 7th of Inst
month the defendant falsely, wickedly
and maliciously published an article in
the San Francisco Chronicle seriously re
flecting on her good name.
By that article, she avers, the readers
were led to believe that she obtained ad
mission to a Mardi Gras ball in 1806 sur
reptitiously and without invitation; mat
she was not a woman of jrooa moral char
acter, and had conducted herself at the
ball in a manner unbecoming a woman of
good moral character; that she was a
woman of loose morals; that her actions
caused other young ladies to remain away
from subsequent similar entertainments,
and that she was "a social pariah" and
one who had been rejected and condemned
by society.
Mrs. Maison alleges that all the matters
thus published by Mr. de Young are false,
and that they were maliciously intended
to injure her in her name and reputation,
and greatly humiliated her and caused
her distress and suffering. Wherefore she
demands the payment of $50,000 damages,
costs of suit and $100 attorney's fees.
KERRIGAN IS VINDICATED
Talk of a "Full" in Which
There Was Absolutely
No Truth.
Policemsn in a Very Uncomfortable
Positionâ They D ny Knowledge
*ol "I:, flue nee."
Justice of the Peace Frank H. Kerrigan,
who has bean fitting as a Police Judge
during Judge Conlan's illness, received a
complete vindication yesterday in the
matter of statements that influence had
been used on him to effect the release of
three young boys charged with battery.
The three policemen who were credited
by an evening paper with having cast
aspersions on Judge Kerrigan's acts were
placed in a very uncomfortable position
and only extricated themselves by admit
ling that they knew absolutely nothing
on wbich to base the accusations made.
Judge Kerrigan was naturally much in
censed when the story appeared in an
evening paper several days ago and at
once cited the officersâ Sergeant Ma honey
and Patrolmen Mat-key and Shawâ to ap
pear before him and explain themselves.
Malivney appeared on Thursday and de
nied absolutely having given the inter
view in which he was quoted as having
said that the boys had been released on a
"pull."
Yesterday he qualified his testimony by
staling that when the patrolmen had told
him Â«hat the esses against the three boys
had been dismissed he had declared that
if the Police Courts did not support the
police more the latter would have to make
frequent use of their clubs.
Then he declared that he knew of noth
ing of a pull in the case, and that he was
ready and willing at any time to sign a
statement that he knew of nothing against
the character or actions of the Justice.
Patrolmen Shaw and Mackey were
equally certain 'that, they knew nothing
-that would tend to dhow "that any influ
ence had been attempted on the Judge.
The former had heard _ stranger say to
Sergeant Cullen that "something must be
done to get the boys out of trouble."
Those in the courtroom smiled at the men
tion of the accommodating "stranger,"
and the Justice expressed 'iinsTf as satis
fied and dismissed the matter with the re
mark that he had merely called the io
licemen into court to set himself right
before tb. public.
Justice Kerrigan is one of the most re
spected young public officials at the City
Hall, and of the lew people who saw the
original story next to none to take any
stock in it.
BIG BANK SUIT.

Check for 2,000 Now
iv Court.
The suit of the Crocker-Woolworth Bank
against the Nevada Bank for $21,988 was
on trial in Judge Seawell's court yester
day. A number of prominent lawyers
were present to see that the matter should
go along smoothly. ",''*!':
The suit crows out of the famous forgery
of a $22,000 check by the Becker- Creecan-
Dean gang, in which the two banks were
victimized, the Crocker-Woolworth finally
sufferin*. by direct payment of the check
through the clearing-house operations.
Some testimony was taken and the fur

Their First Night Away From Home
Spent B.neath Trees at
â¢Temescal.
Maud Altrige and Edith Woolley, two
little misses who can boast of but 13 years,
each wished to be an actress.
Edith had already had a brief taste of
life behind the footlights. When a wee
bit of a girl she had played infant parts
with Ethel Brandon, and the glamour of
the greenroom has ever since seemed to
her something akin to paradise.
Yesterday morning they left for school
at the proper time, but, once out of sight
of their respective homes, they hurried to
a trysting-Dlace, where they compared re
sources and perfect- their plans. Maud
had three pearl finger-rings and her com
panion had a modest pair of earrings.
These they promptly disposed of at a
pawnshop, and they were ready to start
on their journey.
That the theatrical profession might be
overstocked with youthful prodigies not
once entered either imaginative brain.
Ethel Brandon, Edith said, was now play
ing in Sacramento. She would remember
Edith's talented performance and would
readily engage her. She would also be
glad to take Maud on Edith's recom
mendation.
There wa_ also a girl friend at Temescal
I who would be welcome, and alter obtain
| ing the money that was the first place
; they headed for.
They called at their friend's house, but
, she was not then at home. By this lime
| the afternoon had grown into night and
! it was too late to return to their homes.
â  They had no place in Temescal to sleep,
; and after wandering aimlessly about for
some kind of shelter they lay down be
neath some big trees on one of the ranches
in the neighborhood and in spite of the
cold fell asleep.
E irly yesterday morning they made the
return trip to San Francisco, but not
bound for their homes.
They had discovered that their adven
ture was just a little commonplace so far
as they had gone and they concluded that
what they needed was more company.
Accordingly they determined to invite a
couple of their boy friends to accompany
them.
With this purpose in view they were
lingering about the Mechanics' Pavilion
when Detective Anthony caught sight of
them. Complaint had been made at the
police office of their absence and the of
ficer tooK the girls in tow. They at first
gave fictitious names, but the sight of the
prison brought tears and confession and
to the de ectivo they related the story of
their wanderings.
The young culprits were booked for
some public institution, and were then
allowed, on order of Judge Carroll, to go
on their own recognizance.
Maud Altrige resides with her mother
and stepfather at 823 O'Farrell street.
Edith Woolly lives with her widowed
mother at 1923 Devisadero street. Both
expressed a willingness to remain at home
hereafter.
PI-OGRESS AT COGSWELL.
Xew Forget and Lathe Machines Blake
the students Happy.
Great progress has lately been made at
the Cogswell Polytechnical College in the
department of practical mechanics. Dur
ing the past week forges, lathes and
planing machines have been added to the
stock ot machinery, and the students are
happy because the prospects for molding
during the coming term are very en
couraging.
Superintendent Culver is greatly pleased
over the outlook and he says the students
are more encouraged than they have been
in many months. The utensils now at
hand are far more satisfactory than they
have been before.

that though the formal opening of the exposi

plants, fruits and vegetables for the weekly

are donated daily, and the outlook seems to be
more encouraging than for nearly any exposi
