Termination of the Pitiable Scenes of Terror
at Volo by the Final Occupation of
the Gty by the Turkish
Forces.
PARIS, France, May 9.â A semi-official
note has been issued to the press confirm
ing the report that Greece had written to
the diplomats in Athens with a view to
obtaining the mediation of the power--.
The diplomats, with one exception, ac
knowledged the receipt of the note, prom
ising to use their good offices to bring
about the desire 1 end. Baron yon Pies
sen, the German Minister, merely ac
knowledged the receipt of the note, add
ing he was awaiting instructions from his
Government. The Porte's note states that
it will not consent to an armistice, not de
siring that the Greeks shall be enabled to
reorganize under the pretext that they
are treating for peace. The Sultan will,
however, be conciliatory, adhering to his
promise to grant autonomy to Crete.
Wii'le it is not expected the demand will
be excessive for a war indemnity, he will
ask for a slight strategic modification of
the frontier near Nezeros.
LONDON. Eng, May 9.â ln an inter
view to-day with the Athens correspon
dent of the Daily News, Premier Ralii
said the diplomats ha â  informed his Gov
ernment that if the Greek troops were
withdrawn from Crete the powers would
offer their mediation. The Government
. acceded to the advice of the diplomats
and asked for the free passage of a ship to
-bring the troops to ths Piraeus.
' A dispatch to the Daily Mail from Volo,
describing the visit of the French and
British Consuls to Edhem Pasha at Veles
tino for the purpose of arranging the sur
render of the town, says the panic in Volo
.',' caused by a tear of the Turks attacking
"" the place lasted two weeks. The British
\ consulate was besieged and almost de
molished by a maddened crowd seeking
protection. English newspaper repre
sentatives insisted upon serving with the
police to protect the consulate. When
after the second battle at Velestino
the Greek army retired to Almyros, the
panic in Volo was terrible. People
crowded around Europeans in the streets,
seized them by the clothing and begged
for protection.

The Mail's correspondent mentions the
finding in an abandoned house of an old
man dying from hunger. Continuing, the
dispatch says: "The tension at midnight
was unendurable. The military authori
ties had fled and the civil authorities were
dying from fear. The British and French
Consuls and correspondents resolved to co
to Velestino and arrange for an informal
capitulation of Volo. They returned at 8
o'clock in the morning with Nedjib Bey
and a troop of cavalry under a flag of
tiuce and the British and French flags.
"The entry into Yolo was a triumphal
one. Tbe inhabitants flanked the road in
black masses. Many of them hod donned
a fez. They closed behind the little pro
cession until it grew to the size of a regi
ment, then of an army. All the shops
were shut, but the people were not
alarmed. They behaved as though it was
a holiday. Upon reaching the town hall
the chief actors entered. - Nedjib Bey, ad
dressing the Mayor, read a proclamation
issued by Edhem Pasha, announcing that
Yolo was under the Turkish flag.
"The proclamation declared there would
be no violence, outrage or pillage for
peaceable residents, but severe punish
ment would be inflicted upon plunderers
and bandits. Later the proclamation was
read from the balcony of the town hall,
the crowd outside showing great relief
when it heard the declarations. The Turk

were enthusiastically cheered.
"The Greek warship Psara remained in
port. She was asked to leave in accord

sel was ordered to leave immediately.
Later the Turkish occupying force, very
dusty, but orderly and with bands play

SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY MORNING, MAY 10, 1897. \
VIEW OF THE CITY OF ARTA AND ITS SURROUNDINGS.
' Arta is located on the northern slope of a long ridge which runs off to the southeast between the river Arta and the road to Limera and the eastern extremity of
the Gulf of Arta. Skirting this ridge as it descends from the mountains to the north the river forms a nearly inverted _\, with the limbs extending to the southeast, in
the upper concave ol which the city lies with its northeastern and northwestern sides resting on the water. To the northwest and north are the southern spurs of the
Xero-Vuni Mountains, which run north parallel to the river up to Janina. On the east are the spurs of the Rhadovizdi Mountains, one peak of which ten miles north
east of the city ii_es to a height of 1800 feet. The heights for some distance to the north on both sides of the river are crowned with batteries facing each other and
commanding the several fords and crossing places. The point of view is from southwest of the city on the Turkish side. In the foreground is the river winding
its way through the plain planted .with olive groves and gardens to the gult nine miles below. To the right is the noted stone bridge of Arta, with its one large arch,
which spans the river when low, and the others making a kind of an approach when it is in full bank, which is the case at this season of the year, when the melting
snows on the mountains about Mitsovo and Zvgos Pass feed it abundantly. From the city a dingle road leads around the base of the hill and crossing the bridge
forks off toward Saiagnra on the south, Prevesa-Louros on the southwest and west and Janina on the north. To the left and north are the Turkish barracks and
batteries of Imaret, the villa- es of Dlacherna and Genienitza with other Turkish batteries and camp. In the middle distance is the western part of the city, the other
being hidden by the hill. Well up on the slope is the famous Church of the Madonna Pagoritza (or Consolation),' the oldest and most magnificent of the many grand
and beautiful churches for which this little city is famous. Near it is the Church of St. Theodora, which contains the tomb of that saint. On the ridge to the right
are the batteries which form the left of the Greek line of fortifications and which command all the approaches to the city from the Turkish side with the bridge and the
plain beyond.
turned faces of [people awaiting with the
deepest anxiety the words which should
decide their fate. The voice of the Mayor's
translator was inaudible. The people
eagerly cried: "Speak louder. "We cannot
hear."
When the voice of tho reader was raised
and the meaning of the proclamation was
caught a murmur of intense relief ran
through the crowd, immediately followed
by frantic shouts of "Long live the Sal
tan!" and "Hurrah for the Turks!"
ATHENS, Greece, May 9â Colonel
Vassos, who, with other officers, was re
called from Crete, has arrived. He says
affairs on the island are now being admin
istered in the name of the Kine of Greece
and its union with Greece already exists
as a fact, the sanction of Europe only be
ing lacking. Vassos adds: "The foreign
admirals in Cretan waters were recently
obliged to advance the international
troops beyond the zone previously occu
pied. They bad to ask for my authority
to do so. Therefore the powers may do
what they like, but their union remains
an inevitable necessity."
GREECE NOT SUPPLIANT.
Rasdy to Sacrifice Crete to Save
the Country From Further
Calamities.
[Copyrighted. 1897, by the New "i one Sun.]
LONDON, Eng., May 9.â Despite the
slight conflict in the reports, it is clear
enough that Greece has by no means ap
proached the powers 'in an attitude of
supplication. Most reliable statements
prove the Government verbally notified
the diplomats of its desire tor peace, but
felt it impossible to appeal to them to in
tervene as the army remained intact. The
diplomats replied that if Greece would
withdraw; her troops from Crete, the
powers I would offer t< mediate between
her i-ud Turkey.^ The Government there
upon, judging it prudent to sacrifice Crete
in order to save the country lurther cal
amities, acceded; but felt its position
strong enough to stipulate certain con
ditions as already stated.
Here is where the delay occurs. . While
it is declared in one direction that Greece's
stipulations are of such a mild character
the powers are almost certain to acquiesce
in them, it is stated on the other hand
that Germany is stickling for conditions
that Greece cannot possibly accept, they
being calculated to shake the very founda
tion of the State. This is interpreted to
be a demand that the dynasty be de
throned.
The Athens correspondent of the Chroni
cle, probably referring to this, says he is
in a position to say that if the concert is
instigated by one inimical power with a
wish to impose conditions touching the in
tegrity of the kingdom and national honor,
the situation, though bad, is not des
perate, and the national force* are not ex
hausted. It Is expected in all quarters the
powers will definitely reply to-morrow.
Prime Minister Ralli believes the im
mediate effect of the note will be a fort
night's armistice, but Turkey's unwilling
ness to agree to this has already been
noted. The Turkish soldiery are eager
for more fighting, and they are supported
by the war party in Constantinople, which
is daily gaining strength. Even the re
cent peace advocates are being carried
along with the current. However, the
ablest Turks, equally with the diplomats,
are keenly alive to internal dangers to the
Ottoman empire from the victorious
army. '
Anyhow it seems impossible tbe powers
will allow hostilities to be continued until
peace is definitely settled. If they do,
probably the bloodiest work of the war is
yet to come. Y.tyv : .
The royal family is working actively to
obtain a re-establish of peace. It is
oelieved the Czar," at the instance of
Queen Oiga, will use his influence at Con
-tantinop:e to -secure an armistice, -and
also for the evacuation of Thessaly by the
Turkish troops. . Crown Princess Sophie
lias approach'- a her brother, Emperor
William, to secure the same ends.
INDICATE AN ATTACK.
Significant Movements of the Main
Turkish Army in the Vicinity
"of Dhomoko.
[_, LONDON, Era, May 9.â An Athens dis
patch to the Daily. News says the main
Ottoman army is at Vryssa and Tehatma,
tniuway between Pharsala and Dhomoko.
Its movements indicate an impending at
tack upon the posts at Dhomoko. Tbe
dispatch remarks upon the splendid posi
tion the Greeks occupy, and says their
right might be successfully assailed by
mountain artillery, but it is difficult to
see how their left could possibly be car
ried. General Smolenski, the hero of
Velestino, is expected to speedily join the
mam Greek army with his brigade.
The Times to-morrow will say edi
torially: "The powers cannot call on Tur
key to withhold her victorious hand until
assured unmistakably that Greece will
submit to the terms which they may de
cide 7 fair. It ;Is all nonsense to talk of
the humiliation this will involve for Greece
und for driving her to desperation.
" ' "Nothing ' the majority of the powers
assent v to is likely 'to be of a character to
drive any reasonable nation to despera
tion. They will see tbat Greece gets fair
terms and more, but they are not -likely
to tie 1 their hands , by bargaining as 'I to
what the terms will be. . If she wants in
tervention she can : have ; it, but cannot
have j intervention - and \ the j privilege of
making her own bargain, too."
The correspondent of the Times in
Athens telegraphs the change in public
sentiment is so great that no opposition
whatever has been provoked by the de
cision of the Government to abandon
Crete.
CANEA, Crete, May 9.â An exodus ol
Christian volunteers is beginning. The
Cretans do not appear to notice the recall
of Vassos and show no signs of desiring
r to treat for peace. They continue to at
tack Turkish outposts.
RCMEYN TO BE REPRIMANDED.
His Indiscretion on the Parade Grounds
Censuredâ The Captain Will Pursue
O'Brien.
ATLANTA, Ga., May 9.â Much surprise
has been created here by the announce-
ment on positive authority that th- ver
dict of the Romeyn court-martial is not
an acquittal for Captain Henry Romeyn.
The findings, which are now before Gen
eral Merritt, head of the Department of
the East, recommend that Romeyn be
reprimanded. There was not a dissenting
vote on the verdict, but some discussion
as to how it should be couched. Undoubt
edly the severity of the sentence was miti
gated by the fact that Romeyn is to retire
in thirty days on count of age, and so
the court-martial wished to let him off as
lightly as possible in view of his record of
thirty-four years of faithful servic*.
The court censures Romeyn for indis
cretion in knocking down Lieutenant
O'Brien on the parade ground. The court
felt, however, that there was a sufficient
volume of gossip at the barracks regard
ing the conduct of Mr.-. O'Brien to warrant
him in making the comments ho did. .-^
From the same source comes the news
that the charges preferred against Lieu
tenants Bamford and O'Brien by Romeyn
Willie ignored for the present, the de
partment being convinced that Romeyn
was influenced by feelings of a purely per
sonal nature in lodging the complaints,
and that if they were in good faith and
for the good of the service they should
have been filed at the time of the occur
rence of the provoking actions. >-''Â»:Â»
Romeyn states that if the department
carries out this policy he will prosecute
his charges to the greatest possible extent
as soon as his prospective retirement re
leases bim from the necessity of employ
ing regimental methods. Â He will then
appeal direct to the adjutant-general at
Washington to order a hearing of charges.
' It is said that the report ot the court
martial passes some severe str.ciures .-n
the prevalence of gossip as a novel and
unnecessary element in military life.
TO PROTECT SEAL HERDS.
This Country and Great Britain Will Send
Expert Commissioners to the
Bering Sea. '
WASHINGTON, D. 0., May 9. â Ex-
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Ham
lin, advisory agent of the United States
in the negotiations with Great Britain for
an agreement to protect the seal her is in
the Bering Sea, has arrived from San
Francisco. His trip to the Pacific Coast
was to consult _ Professor David Starr
Jordan â¢ regarding another investigation
tbis year into the condition of * the herd*.
Professor Jordan has accepted the posi
tion of expert commissioner, and will
start for i Bering Sea i without delay. ; He
will have the same assistant who accom
panied him last season.-.
It was learned to-day that the British
Government had informed the State De
partment that it would send anott-.er ex
pert commission to Bering Sea during the
present season. The commission will con
sist of Professor Thompson and Mr. Mc-
Gowan. who visited tho seal islands last
year. Professor Thompson, 1 ' according ito
the notification from Great Britain, is
now on the way from Japan to Vancouver.
The appointment of tbe British commis
sion was' requested by this Government,
but it was not expected that Salisbury
| would grant it.
BURNED TO THE

v
Ship Francis From This
City Now Lies on
the Bar.
Captain and Crew Make a Gal
lant Fight to Save the.
Vessal.
Heroic Efforts to Check the Flames
Fall and a Run Is Made to
- the Beach.
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., May 9.â The
full-rigged ship Francis, 111 days from
San Francisco for New York. lies on the
bar, near Little Egg Harbor Inlet, almost
burned to the water's edge. Yesterday
the Francis was seen passing up the coast,
evidently in distress.
At 9 o'clock last night the captain of the
Little Egg Harbor; life-station; ten miles
north, saw blue lights flashing from a
vessel five miles off shore and heading for
the beach. He ordered out a lifeboat and
waited for the ship to ground. Half an
hour after the Francis stranded on the
bar, the life-saving crew, launched a boat
and found the \ Francis' crew heroically
working to subdue a dangerous fire raging
in the hold. p^v^
When the hatches were opened to allow
the fighters to get nearer the fire the
flames shot skyward in an immense sheet,
enveloping the mizzen rigging and driv
ing the men from the ship. From the
windward they finally returned to the
conflict and for half an hour kept the
pumps i actively working, and with
hatchets and picks I removed | the inflam
mable material, undaunted by the terrific
heat of the afterdeck, which was being
consumed. Though the heat and blind
ing smoke several times drove the men
from the vessel, they never ceased in their
labors until 2 o'clock this morning, when
nature refused to longer prolong the un
equal battle \ and they, were forced to
abandon the ship. ;At that time a tug
boat of the Merritt wrecking service look
a hand and made several efforts to ' bring
hose to Dear on the burning ship.
All night the flames continued the
havoc, but about sunrise subsided. The
Francis is now lying in about twelve feet
of water with a strong list to "starboard.
H. r mizzen rigging is entirely gone. The
quarter-deck, companionway and cabin
were entirely destroyed. ;
The Francis is in command of Captain
A. L. Smith and a crew of twenty-five.
The captain stated that the fire was dis
covered Friday night. Detailing the crew
into equal watches he set the pumps work
ing. Finding the fire gained he battened
down the hatches in the hope the strong,
southerly breeze would carry him into
Now York harbor in time to save the ship.
When opposite Absecon light he saw the
ship would not last that long, so be de
termined to beach her. The Francis car
ried a general cargo, consisting principally
of wine. On her voyage to "San Francisco
last winter Captain Smith's wife died. Ho
believes the origin of the fire was spon
taneous combustion. r.'ft^y

Back to Port. - _%s^i
NEW YORK, N. V., May The Mal
lory Line steamship Leona, which sailed
from here Saturday afternoon, returned
late to-night, after a fire at sea in which
thirteen people aboard were burned to
death. â  â  â¢
Officers of the vessel refused to disclose
the news until midnight to-night, and
even then the police had to demand veri
fication in order to notify the Coroner.
When the steamer sailed Saturday she
bad forty passengers aboard, twenty-two
of whom were in the steerage, mostly Ger
mans. They were quartered forward on
the steerage deck in bunks. They retired
Saturday night and when Captain Wilder
made an inspection at midnight every
thing was shipshape and the passengers
sleeping.
At 1 o'clock this morning, while the
Leona was ' off Delaware Capes, tne for
ward watch was startled by the smell of
smoke, which was traced to the steerage
deck. Tue sailors attempted to investi
gate, but were forced back by overpower
ing fumes. The steerage was charged
with smoke, and the glimpse the sailors
got of the steerage showed unfortunates
trying to- get out of their bunks, while
others were huddled "on the floor un
conscious. .'-*'""â 
Captain Wilder gave orders to man tha
fire pumps and calling for a couple of vol
unteers he and two officers dashed into
the steerage, despite the fact that all was
smoke and flames there. They dragged
out as many of the passengers as they
could an 1 then returned for a breath of
air. They started in again, but seeing it
would be suicidal to attempt another ven
ture, returned. The captain then gave or
ders for the hold to be charged with steam
to overcome the fire. Officers and men
worked hard to save the steerage passen
gers and all had their hair, whiskers and
eyebrows burned. For three hours the
officers and men battled with the flames.
The cabin passengers were awakened by
the nois9 on deck and turned out in their
night clothes. It was known by this
time that thirteen persons were 'missing,
two stewards being among them. The
rest were immigrants, recently landed, on
the way to Galveston. As soon as the
captain had the fire under control he
turned the ship about and started for the
nearest port.
It wa3 found impossible to steer the ves
sel from the pilot-house, as the entire
vessel was hot, and the .eat was too in
tense in the pilot-house for a man to stay
there. The captain was obliged to use a
hand steering gear. The vessel was man
aged by a wheel in the stern. An officer
in charge of the fire brigade finally re
ported the 'fire extinguished, and an ex
amination showed the ship in no danger.

the burned section, said the fire had hoi- j
lowed out the forward hold, but that, the (
bull was intact. The captain then de
rided to return to New York. The vessel j
reached the pier at 11:30 o'clock to-night
with the captain so badly exhausted he
was unable to leave his cabin. The offi
cers declined positively to give any infor
mation even to the police, and the watch
man would not let the police on the pier.
Mr. Mallory was hastily summoned from
Brooklyn and arrived after midnight. He
said the officers had had no time to make i
a thorough investigation of the fire, and
had not been in the steerage to view the
bodies. He said the vessel had a general
cargo and the fire must have been started
by spontaneous combustion in the cargo.
He understood, though, the fire had only
been burning five or ten minutes when
discovered. Ho said the men cut holes in
the deck for the pumps and did every
thing possible to extinguish the fire. The
dead were not disturbed. They lie where j
they fell in thÂ« steerage. They will be re- I
moved on order of the Coroner.
Those killed were: Bridget Sullivan, R. *
Cataine, Mrs. C. (Juzza and daughter,
Miss Hannah Solomonson, Miss J. Val- i
cyck, Sophie Schwartz, Maria Mades, all
of the steerage; Alfred Howry and Alfred
Land, stewards; H. Hartman, butcher,
und two unidentified children.
The Coroner arrived after midnight and
put the captain under arrest. His inves
tigation reveals further details. There
was a great quantity of cotton bagging i
and matches in the cargo. Some was
stored in the compartment for steerage ]
passengers on the port side forward. The i
steerage passengers were berthed in two
small rooms. It is supposed that the fire |
started in the cotton baggin_ stored on
the port side of the steerage.
Within a few minutes after the fire broke I
out the steamer City of Augusta which
was following the Leona south was sig- >
naled. She came alongside and took off I
all the passengers who could be mustered. j
She stood by the Leona and Captain j
Wilder had his crew of fifty men do noth- I
ing but fight the fire. All cargo on 'tween
decks forward was burned. The main I
deck forward was burned through. The j
upper deck was protected by iron sheeting,
which alone saved it. In the morning the
bodies of the victims were found in a heap
where the door of their compartment had
been. After the fire was subdued the
Lecna took back her passengers from the
City of Augusta. W*): .
SOUTHERN FLOOD SITUATION.
Energetic Work on the Levses â Farmer
Shot by a Guardâ Town of Trinity
Under Water.
NEW ORLEANS, La., May 9.â Baton
Rouge took steps to-day to secure the
weak and broken levee which has threat
ened all the country below with an over
flow. At a mass-meeting of citizens,
presided over by tbe Governor, subscrip
tions were taken up. The City Council
and police jury of the parish have also
made appropriations, ana an entirely new
levee will be constructed if necessary.
This has been for some time past the most
dangerous part of the lower river.
The third levee killing was reported to
day from Ne.v Texas, Pointe Coupee Par
ish, where Benjamin Peters, a farmer,
was shot by a guard who mistook him for
a levee-cutter. The levees are naturally
highroads between ail points on the river,
but the guards are quick at shooting
without asking questions.
In consequence of the break of the
Angola levee, all that fine estate of over
6000 acres is submerged, and there is not
a living being nor a head of stock remain
ing on the place. . ;
It is announced that the overflow in
Texas basin has not only destroyed the
fruit crop, but Killed the fruit trees.
The town of Trinity, Catahoula Parish,
at the junction of Texas, Ouachita and
Black rivers, is submerged.
The fight against the flood is costing
New Orleans from $5000 to $7000 a day for
the pay of levee guards and laborers.

Moores Is Equally Determined
to Be the Mayor of
Omaha.
Both Are Union Veterans, and the
Conflict Is Deplored by Their
Comrades.
OMAHA, Nebr., May â¢9.â Half a score of
uniformed police are standing guard in
the office of retiring Mayor Broach, while
several others. patrol the corridors of the
City Hall to-night. In' addition an un
usual number of police are held at the
central police station to answer an emer
gency call. This is the only tangible evi
dence that at midnight this city will have
two Mayors, and to-morrow it will prob
ably have other duplicate officers in the
way of Police Commissioners, two police
forces, City Councils, etc.
Retiring Mayor Broach announces to
night that he is prepared to hold the office
by force Â» until his successor, Colonel
Moores, qualifies, which Broach declares
is impossible on account of the alleged
shortage in his county accounts.
Moores ridicules this, declaring that
after midnight he will be Mayor by virtue
of his recent election.
Chief of Police Read issued a general
order to the entire force to-night in which
they are instructed to take orders from
Broach only until after the controversy is
settled in the cotfrts.
The force on guard at the Mayor's office
is regulary relieved, so that a fresh force
is always ready to resist any effort the new
Mayor may make to get into his quarters.
Just what the officers have b9en instructed
to do in the event that Moores attempts to
use force is unknown, but the friends of
Broach say they have been instructed to
use such force as may be necessary to pre
vent Moores taking charge of the Mayor's
office.
Broach declares that he put the police
on guard because he had neard that
Moores would attempt to take the office
by force at midnight. Moores denies that
he desires to do anything of the kind.
The probabilities are nothing will be
done to-night, but that to-morrow he will
mandamus Broach, thus settling the con
troversy without violence; but there is
still an element of uncertainty in the fact
that in any event the case will be promptly
appealed to the Supreme Court and before
that hody decides both Broach and
Moores will insist upon acting as Mayor.
The Union Veterans' Republican Club
to-day passed this resolution:
Resolved, That it is with profound regret we
learn of the efforts of Comrade Broach to pre- <
vent the induction into oflice of Comrade
Moores, his lawful successor, and we hereby
tender Moores our support. As veterans and
sons of veterans we deplore the sensational
efforts to array one class against another.
Additional factor-} in the fight to-mor
row will be the two Councils and two
Boards of Police Commissioners. At the
last meeting the Moores element declared
the old Council adjourned permanently,
but the other faction maintains that the
charter was invalid and that all officers
pretending to hold office by virtue of the
recent election under that charter are not
legally elected to the offices.
Compromise seems impossible. Should
Moores make any effort to meet Broach's
show of force with like methods the result
will be serious; but Moores, who is an old
soldier, ridicules the idea of bloodshed.
He laughingly says that he was elected
and therefore will be Mayor at midnight.
If he cannot sit in the Mayor's office he
will carry on business temporarily at
other quarters. If violence is resorted to,
Moores declares that it must come from

KENTUCKY FEUD RENEWED.
Captain William Strong, Union Veteran
and Victor in a Score of Gun
Plays, Is Assassinated.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 9.â Captain
William Strong, the greatest mountain
fighter in Eastern Kentucky, died with
his boots on to-day after having success
fully dodged bullets for twenty-fiye years.
He had left his home, which is about ten
miles east of Jackson, to go to the house
of a neighbor. He had been cone only a
few moments when his family was startled
by shooting apparently not half a- mile
away. Members of the family ran toward
the place and found Strong dead on the
roadside, seven bulle:s having penetrated
his body. Strong was lying on his back
with a revolver in his right hand. The
revolver had barely been drawn from his
pocket when a bullet broke his arm.
Investigation showed that a blind had
been constructed in a place immediately
above the road, commanding a full view
for several hundred yards, and scraps of
bread and meat showed that several men
had been hiding there. Relatives of
Strong were notified and this afternoon a
large posse has been searching for the as
sassins. The posse is headed by Lieuten
ant^Ea Marcum, who served with Captain
'Strong as first lieutenant through the four
years that the captain fought .for the
Union. Marcum says he thinks he knows
who murdered his uncle and intends to
run tbem down if it takes months.
Strong is credited with killing more

which he has participated for more than a
quarter of a century. He owned two

CIVIL SERVICE FAVORITISM.
Interesting Material lor the .Senate Inves-
tigatmg Committeeâ A Thrilty War
Department Clerk.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 9.â The
Senate committee investigating charges of
illegal operations of the civil service law
will resume its sittings next Saturday.
Much interesting testimony has already
been placed^ on file from Cabinet officers
and department officials generally, and it
is understood that at its meetings next
week some instances of favoritism for
which there is apparently no justification
in the civil service rules will be called to
the attention of the committee.
One of the interesting cases of this kind
is that of a clerk in the record and pension
division of the War Department, the
chief of which is Colonel F. C. Ainjworth
of the navy, who has made a reputation
for maintaining the strictest discipline
among the clerks of his division.
One of the clerks, hailing from Texas,
is said to enjoy the privilege of assisting a
claim agent, formerly a Congressman
from Bailey's district, during the day,
and reporting to the War Department for
some mysterious light duty until 1 o'clock
in the morning, although the War De
partment closes promptly at 4 o'clock
each day. While in Congress this claims
agent was largely instrumental in having
the Indian depredation bill passed, and
he is now busily and profitably engaged
in prosecuting claims against the Govern
ment under the terms of this act.
Section 1782, Revised Statutes, provides
a penalty of fine and imprisonment for
any clerk â ': in the employ of the Govern
ment who receives any compensation for
work done in connection witn a claim in
which the United States is a party. 1 "" .
Probably this Texas case has not been
called to the attention of the Civil Ser
vice Commission, but the facts are avail
able for the use of the Senate committee
now gathering testimony on the subject
of the workings of the civil service law.

MARRIAGE BELLS
SOUND AT UKIAH
Louis Meyer of Healds
burg Weds Miss Oza
Waldrop.
Pretty Ceremony Conducted
by Rabbi Nieto of San
Francisco.
The Bride, Though a Baptist Minis
ter's Daughter, a Convert to
Judaism.
UKIAH, Gal., May 9.â A pretty wed
ding took place to-day in this city, the
contracting parties being Louis Meyer
and Miss Oza Waldrop, both of Healds
burg. The words making them man and
wife were spoken by Rabbi Nieto of San
Francisco at the residence of W. H.
Southard. ; Everything being in readi
ness the very impressive ceremony of the
Jewish church was soon held.
The groom was attired in the usual
black, while the bride was resplendent in
a handsome gray traveling costume.
Felice Cerf and Celia Hoffman acted as
bridesmaids and Sam Goldstein and
Elias Lobree acted as groomsmen. After
the marriage bans had been pronounced,
Rev. Joseph Waldrop, the father of the
bride, invoked a blessing upon the couple.
Then Mr. and Mrs. Meyer were driven to
the railway depot and boarded a train for
San Francisco, wnere they will remain a
few weeks. They will then go to Salinas
City, where Mr. Meyer has established a
general merchandise store and where
they will make their home in the future.
The groom is widely known throughout
the State as a prominent newspaper man,
having for many years been editor and
manager of the Healdsburg Tribune. He
is a native of that city.
The bride is a Southern lady, a young
and beautiful blonde, petite and of grace
ful bearing. She has but recently en
tered the covenant of Israel, and was con
firmed in that faith by Rev. Ur. Nieto.
This circumstance was somewhat un
usual inasmuch as she is the daughter of
a prominent divine, the Rev. Joseph'Wal
drop, pastor of the First Baptist Church
of Healdsburg. Mrs. Meyer is a highly
accomplished young lady, and as an elo
cutionist has achieved success in the prin
cipal cities of the Pacific Northwest.

first of the fights before the club will prob
ably be the McCoy- O'Brien, which will
take place not later than June 10.
SAN JOSE MISER'S WEAL TH.
Government Cashes a United States Bond
â  Found in Hermit Rodman's
Ark.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May The Commer
cial and Savings Bank of this city yester
day received $1077 from the United States
Treasury at Washington in exchange for
the $1000 Government bond belonging to
the estate of Charles F. Rodman, and
which was . recently recovered by Public
Administrator Secord from George Emory,
who found the bond in an old houseboat
in which Rodman had lived. /
Rodman was a miser. For years ho
occupied an ark on a slough near Alviso.
Last August he was found dead in the
ark. After the inquest Coroner Secord
sold the craft to Emory lor $70 50. In
searching his purchase Emory found con
siderable gold and several bonds, his find
amounting in all to over $7000. '
The gold he divided with George Beard,
who was in the secret, and then he started
out for a good time, taking a trip East
and drinking large quantities of liquor.
Upon his return rumors of his find
reached Public Administrator Secord, and
he instituted an action to recover the
money or as much of it as could be found.
Beard had disappeared, but Emory was
hauled into court and closely questioned
by Attorney Beasty, and the tacts were
drawn from him. All he had left of the
old hermit's wealth was a dilapidated
Government bond bearing the date of
1861, much of the printing on which was
not discernible. This -is the bond for
which the bank received payment yester
day.
Emory is now in the County Hospital.

FIRE AT SAN DIEGO.
Complete Destruction ot a ' Handsome
Building Held in Trust for a
Boys' Home.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., . May 9.â A fire at
noon to-day completely destroyed the
building known as the Boys' Home on
Howard tract in the City Park. ' r .
The building, was erected in' lÃ9o by
Bryant Howard,^ president of the Consoli
dated National Bank, out of the funds
left in trust from the estates of James M.
Pierce and 0". S. Witherby. It was a
three-story brick and frame structure de
signed in Queen Anne style and cost $25,
--000. The sue was a beautiful one, com
manding a magnificent view of the city,'
the bay, the ocean and the surrounding
country. After the failure of the Consoli
dated Bank the building and land were
turned over in trust to the city and since
than have been so held. J- __
At the time of the fire the home was oc
cupied by ' Park Superintendent Havice.
Mr. Havice's family were attending
church and he had built a tire in the range
for the noon cooking. He wai entertain
ing a few male friends, who had called to
see him. When they started to go he
went with them down the road for a short
distance. Glancing back he saw fire com
ing out of the chimney above the roof.
The men ran back and did all in their
power to save the building, but as there
was no water hydrant near and but little
pressure in the pipes their labors were
futile. The loss of the building is a severe
blow to the city, as there was no insur
ance. V'-t/'

PRESCOTT.-Aeiz., May 9.â Three pris
oners made a successful break for liberty
from the County Jail at noon to-day and
when. last seen were riding southward,
mounted on stolen horses procured at the
point of the pistol. At the jail were found
Assistant District "Attorney Lee Norris,
thought to be fatally wounded by a pistol
bullet in the breast, and Jailor Kobert
Meador, beaten on the head and also suf
fering from a bullet wound.
& The escapes are "Jim" Parker, who,
with his partner, who was killed on the
spot, held "'tip the Atlantic and Pacific
train at Rock Cut, near Peach Springs,
several - months ago, a Mexican named
Cornelli, accused of murder, and L. C.
Miller, a forger arrested a week ago at
Tucson. The Sheriff and a strong posse
are in pursuit. The trail is a plain one.
It is not believed that either Barker or
Miller will be taken alive. The former
was captured near the Grand Canyon of
the Colorado, only after he had been de
prived of strength by starvation, while
Miller is a notorious desperado, who shot
City Marshal Miles Archibald of Prescott
several years ago, and narrowly escaped
the gallows. ... ;
The escape is believed to have been due
to the carelessness of Meador, who has
been jailer for many years. He entered
the jail corridor armed, and was seized by
the prisoners, shot with a bullet from his
own pistol and pounded into insensibility.
ft orris, who is a young man lately ad
mitted-to practice, was at the jail door to
see a prisoner. He attempted to stop the
escaping criminals, and was shot down
with' the jailer's pistol. The escapes are
believed to have bad help from the out
side and to have been supplied with
weapons other than those they took from
the jailer. One thousand dollars reward
is offered for the men dead or alive. â  ;,\>v;

DALLES , HER CHIEF CITY.
..." Prepared Under the Auspices of the Commercial Club.
THE DALLES, Oregon, May 7.â
Wasco County embraces the territory
between the Cascade Range on the west,
the Deschuttes River on the east, the
Columbia River on the north and Crook
County on the south, the southern por
tion of the county extending easterly be
yond the Deschuttes about thirty-five
miles. The county is therefore about
sixty-five miles in width on tbe average
and about sixty-five miles north and
south.
The topography of Wasco County is
varied in character from the mean eleva
tion of 100 feet above the sea level along
the banks of the Columbia River, her
northern boundary, up the ribbed sides
of Mount Hood, including the summit
thereof, with Mount Jefferson in the ex
treme southwest corner of the county an
inieres'in. second.
The soil is an alluvial deposit usually of
great depth, strictly of a mineral char
acter, which ruases it practically inex
haustible in strength, free from bardpan,
which permits it to absorb to its full capa
city the moisture from the melting snows
and the occasional rains of winter, which
it feeds out by capillary attraction to the
growing vegetables in season.
The products of Wasco County aro as
varied in character as the topography of
her surface. Along her river and creek
bottom lands, where irrigation is practi-
cable, small fruits and vegetables, alfalfa
and similar crops are grown prolificly.
On the bench, or upland, fruits of the
hardier character are perfectly adapted,
while upon the plain, or plateau tracts,
are seen the broad acres of wheat and
other cereal crops. Tbe rough lands bor
dering upon the Columbia and Deschuttes
rivers, together with the lands in the
southern portion of the county, too re
mote for the present means of transporta
tion of the grain crops, would yield in
abundance. They are at present used as
the winter quarters for the many large
flocks of she-p that are pastured in the
mountain ranges during the summer
season.
The fruits are second to none produced
on the Pacific Elope, which is witnessed
by the willingness of our horticulturists
to enter into a competitive exposition of
fruit with ail other localities of the same
latitude or zone. At the Portland Exposi
tion in 1892, competing with all the
counties of Oregon, Washington and
Idaho, she was awarded the county prize,
together with eleven of the thirteen pos
sible special prizes awarded at the same
exposition.
Wasco County yet has an extensive area
awaiting and inviting thrifty horticultur
ists, assuring them the same success that
is now enjoyed by those already exten
sively engaged in the production of the
superior and delicious strawberries of
Hood River Valley, which are so well
known in Omaha and other Northwestern
markets. In speaking thus favorably of !
the strawberry products, wecannot place it |
ahead of the possibilities in the produc- *
tion of winter apples, which are now
sought after at prices ranging from $1 50 j
to $2 per box. One interesting feature of j
the fruit orchards In this county is the i
rapid growth, rich verdure and extensive j
foliage, producing fruit unequaled in |
flavor and shipping qualities. Other fruit, j
such as prunes, grapes, apricots, peaches I
and cherries, are and can be extensively j
grown.
In connection with the foregoing re- 1
sources should be mentioned extensive !
Jive stock interests, principally sheep ana !
cattle, together with lumb.-r and fishing j
interests. The lumber industry is yet in j
its infancy. Along the eastern slope of '
_ the Cascade mountains aro extensive :
tracts of superior quality of fir, pine and
cedar timber awaiting reasonable invest
ment to guarantee successful results.
The fishing interests along the banks of
the Columbia River are an annual source
of revenue to many residents of Wasco
County, and especially to those owning
fortunate locations at The Dalles Rapids,
Ce. llo Falls and other points suitable for
the erection and maintenance of fish
wheels, which is the favorite process of
catching-the famous Columbia River sal
mon.
The chief city of Wasco County is The
Dalles, which on account of its favorable
location on the Columbia River, at the
head of deep water navigation, makes it
not only an important factor in the com
mercial interests of Wasco County, but it
also enjoys the distinction of being tne
"Gateway to the Inland Empire," on ac
count oi t c recent completion of the
Government locks at the Cascades.
The Dalles now enjoys an open water
way to Portland, the metropolis" of the
State, and to the seaboard at Astoria.
It is also the terminus of the first division
of the Oregon, Railway and Navigation
Company, which gives it a connection
with transcontinental lines, thus assuring
cheap rates by reaioa of extensive compe
tition.
Ta* Dalles has a population of about
5000; Las good schools, churches main
tamed by several denominations, and the
social conditions are as good - as may be I
found in town*" of similar sfte. The j
climate of The Dalles and Wasco County |
is unexcelled in the Northwest, being I
mild in winter and not excessively warm !
in summer. Spring and autumn are I
most delightful seasons and the summers
and winters are not at all disagreeable on j
account of the extreme changes in tem- 1
peratures.
The snowy peaks of the Cascades cool t
and purify the air, nd the altitude is such |
that there is not the least danger of ma- j
laria. The commercial relations of The |
Dalles are vastly more extensive than |
would be expected of a place not excelling
it in -population, lt enjoys the distinc
tion of loins the largtsi wool-receiving
point direct from the grower? in the United
States. The receipts of the last year were
about 8.000.000 pounds, much of which is (
received from the interior, from a distance i
of irom twenty to 200 miles. The major
ity is brought in by large frei_ht teams, I
with two or three wagons in trail, bearing I
heavy cargoes.
These teams return to tho interior
points laden with general merchandise.
Among the lenuinir mercantile establish
ments of The Dallas may be mentioned
the firms of A. M. Williams & Co. and
Peas-* & Mays, dealers in general mer
chandise, whose annual transactions reach
well mo the six figures; also the large
hardware and farm" implement firm of
Mays A Crowe, which have a stock and
trade equal to, if not excelling, any estab
lishment of a similar character in the
Northwest.
Manufacturing is yet in its infancy. The
Diamond Roller Mills, the property of A.
H. Curtis?, manufacture a superior qual
ity of flour. These mills have a capacity
of 100 barrels per day and are kept con
stantly moving to supply the interior
and local demand.
Among ihe various hotels of the city
we have but to mention the first to greet
-.he eye oft c tourist a-s the Oregon Rail
way and Navigation Company's trains and
Columbia River steamers approach The
Dalles, the Umatilla House, one of the
best-known liotols on the Pacific Coast.
The history of this hotel from the time
when General U. S. Grant was stationed
here would be a history of the inland
empire.
In the "days of gold," when the rush
was made for the mines, the Umatilla
House was the Mecca toward which
miners turned when the storms of winter
set in. It was there that the young and
hopeful breakfasted before leaving civili
zation to make their fortunes in the gold
fields. The miners' hotel was destroyed
by fire, but on its ruins arose tho present
edifice, which is one of the largest and
finest hostelries in the Northwest, con
taining over 200 rooms.
The present hunse is equipped with all
the modern improvements which go to
make life in the hotel enjoyable. The
builuing is lighted throughout by elec
tricity, call bells are in evc/y room and
the table is furnished with all the delica
cies that the market affords. .Ail tourists
who have . traveled the Columbia know
the Umatilla House sand few have left
without hearing Colonel Binnott tell of
the marvelous ran of salmon .in the early
days. More prominent people have regis
tered at this hotel than any other hotel in
the Northwest.
In looking over the register we can
find such names as U. S. Grant, Sherman,
Sheridan, Have.", Henry .Ward Beecher,
W. J. Bryan, Henry Villard and a host of
other men who have helped to make the
history of the United Slates. The office
of the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company, the Western Union, and all
stage lines leaving The Dalles are in the
building. > All steamers plying on the
Columbia land in the same block in which
the hotel is situated. .

are much stirred up over the liberal treat
ment accorded Mrs. Care w, the murderess
now confined in the British Consular jail
at Yokohama. .
They say she is treated like a Queen
and tbat she is being kept in the consular
jail instead of being sent to Hongkong, as
the British law requires, in furtherance of
a plan of herself and friends to secure her
freedom. These friends believe, the Jap
anese claim, that she will be released in a
few years when the new treaties take ef
fect, through a general amnesty being
granted to prisoners detained in consular
prisons.
The favors eranted the murderess are
many. She bas the largest room in the
jail, is allowed to furnish it herself, to re
ceive visitors and presents, to wear her
own dresses, has not had her haircut, has
her room swept daily while she retires to
the room of a prison officer and is per
mitted to order what she wants to eat and
drink three times a day, including a bottle
of stout for dinner.

HASTENS DEATH
WITH DEADLY GAS
Philanthropist Miller of
Stockton Ends His
Life.
Was Slowly Dying From Dis
ease and in Constant
Torment.
The Suicide a Leading: Prohibition
ist and Ever a Friend of
the Needy.
STOCKTON, Cal.. May 9.â William
Payson Miller. 71 years old, a leading
capitalist of Stockton and one of the most
prominent prohibitionists in the State,
committed suicide at an early hour this
morning by turning on the eas in his
apartments. He had been very ill for
long time with a complication of ailments,
and his death was not far distant. His
wife died some time ago and grief over her
loss had aggrivated hi- illness.
Mr. Miller had a housekeeper, Mrs.
Hunt, and when he decided to take his
life he made.an excu-e to sena her to San
Francisco. Her son, Claude Hunt,
wanted to sit up with Miller last night,
but the invalid forbade this and gave the
youth particular instructions not to light a
match in case he smellcd escaping gas.
Nothing was thought of this at the time,
but this morning when the members of
the household were awakened the odor of
escaping gas attracted tbem to Miller's
room. The door was locked but it was
forced open and the body of the capitalist
was found lying on the bed.
When the room was aired so that the
household was able to enter it was found
that Miller had deliberately planned his
death. A gas jet near the bed was turned
n and two notes left on a stand were
evidence that he had arranged every de
tail of the suicide. One of them read:
"Don't light the gas untif it is all re
moved; open the windows first." And
the other: "I write this for my friends.
1 have been a great sufferer for three
months and have decided on this rash act,
contrary to the wishes of dear friends."
Mr. Miller was one of the best known
men in this part of the country, having
settled here in the early fifties, and built
up a lucrative business in the manufac
ture of wagons and carriages.
He was very charitable and a great
worker in the cause of temperance and re
ligion. A short time ago he gave a large
tract of land to the Women's Christian
Temperance Union to aid its cause. His
big carriage-factory and the ground it cov
ered were offered for the Wilmerding
School, in case the regents of the Univer
sity of California decided to give the
school to Stockton. "Kl'\
When it was publicly announced in the
Central Methodist Episcopal Church .this
morning that Mr. Miller was dead, the
grief was , great. >He * had been \ a great
friend of the church and of its many mem
bers.* The deceased left a considerable for
tune, in spite of the fact that he gave much
away during his lifetime. â

Nu KXTKA CHARGE.
The Greeks and the Turks deserve credit
fo- one thing. They got into the ring and
fought it out in short order instead of
jawing about it forever.
Since Bryan has determined to go star
ring round tl c country, it would have
paid him better to have taken to the
stage. The lecture platform is getting
stale.
A Michigan artist has had a picture ac
cepted by the Paris Salon, and we may
now expect Detroit to become indifferent
to her potato-patch fame and set up as an
art center.
The sodawater men of the East are said
to have introduced a new drink called
"airship," but it is not stated whether it
is a good substantial schooner or mainly a
matter of gas.
The chief characteristic of Deboe, the
newly elected Senator from Kentucky, is
said tc be reticence, and we can now un
derstand how complete has been the revo
lution that turned down Blackburn.
In a recent article in Munsey's Magazine
the editor of the Boston Herald says there
are only eight thinking newspapers in
America, and it is clear from such a state
ment by its editor that the Herald cannot
be among the number.
Pennsylvania has declared May 15 a
holiday, and will celebrate it by unveiling
the grand monument to Washington at
Philadelphia. She is not selfish in the
matter, and invites all the rest of the coun
try to come in and take part.
The report of the discovery of a cave in
Ohio which is likely to prove to be larger
than tbe Mammoth cave in Kentucky
may be well founded, but it sounds like
an attempt to give a metaphorical de
scription of the Ohio Democracy.
After the first disaster to the Greek arms
the King declared it was not bis war; a
little later the Cabinet announced the war
did not belong to them, and new the peo
ple assert it was not theirs. We might just
as well recognize it as strictly a Turkish
affair.
Henry Watterson has risen up to reite
rate his assertion "Mr. Cleveland can
never again be President of the United
States," and without expressing an opin
ion as to whether it was worth while to
make the prophecy we can cordially ap
prove the accuracy of it.
The importers jvho are bringing in such
large quantities of foreign goods in a
hurry to escape the higher dutiei of the
new tariff may find in the end they have
been playing a losing game. There is
such a thing as overstocking the market
even in a country as big as this.
General Joseph Wheeler of Alabama
has declared it to be his opinion that the
campaign of 1900 will be fought on the
tariff and that the Democrats will win,
and now the country would like to know
whether the general is in his dotage or
has always been talking that way.
The bill providing for a curfew- bell regu
lation for the youth of Michigan has been
vetoed by the Governor on the ground
that it would interfere with domestic con
cerns. The paternalism of the home he
thinks is sufficisnt to control matters of
that kind if assisted occasionally by the
maternal slipper. /
Among the steerage passengers on a
steamer that recently arrived at Philadel
phia was a Chinaman who gave bis name
as Go Hang, but knowing that Chinese
are not permitted to enter the country he
gave his nationality as "Ilish." It was
recognized by the Philadelphians as a
good bluff for an Oriental, but it didn't go.
According to a student of criminal sta
tistics in the East 33 per cent of those sen
tenced for life in Wisconsin are pardoned
after a few years, 40 per cent in Ohio. 50
in Massachusetts and 03 per cent in New
York. The average term which a life con
vict serves i* less than seven years. As a
general rule in tins country it is safer to
kill a man lhan to steal a hog.
M. Brunetiere, the eminent French
critic, who has been lecturing in New
York, says there is not a person living in
France who is less cultured in French lit
erature and more ignorant of French na
ture than Zola. The novels of the famous
realist he declares to be made up of "ca
ricatures, gloomy, pessimistic and calum
nious portrait of his own character."
It would only be fair now to invite Zola
over to give his impressions oi Brune
tiere.
It will be remembered that when Bwami
Vivekanenda, the gifted Hindoo, was in
this country he was very popular with the
ladies. He bas now gone home, and in
describing American women to his Coun
trymen said, according to report: "When
a woman tries. her best to find a husband
she goes to all the bathing places imagina
ble and tries ait sorts of tricks to catch a
man. When she fails In her attempts she
becomes what they call in America an
â¢old maid,' and joins the church.'' That
is what comes of patronizing the heathen.
COMMERCIAL PROSPECTS.
Trade throughout the country is pro
gressing on conservative lines. The tariff
continues a disturbing factor and com
mercial interests everywhere are anxious
to have the bill passed, so that they may
know what to do. Nothing stagnates
business like uncertainty. Speculation
ceases, merchants buy only from hand to
mouth and values are all at sea. This was
shown last week by the sugar stocks,
which fluctuated sharply on news of tariff
modifications. The whole country will
breathe more freely when the bill is
passed and business men learn where
they stand.
But, as has already been remarked,
business is better than it appears on the
surface. Thus a dispatch from Now York
says that the actual sales in April by lead
ing houses in each line of business in the
principal cities east of the Rocky Moun
tains average only about 10 per cent less
than in April. 1592, the year of the largest
business hitherto, and were 6.1 per cent
mote than in the same month last year.
Yet this is the summary of 657 reports,
each covering actual sales of leading mer
chants in a line of business in fourteen
cities. This exhibit is particularly en
couraging, for it shows that the cry of
hard times is frequently a false note. It
is surely so in the present case, as the
quoted dispatch shows.. We are doing 6
per cent more business than in 1896, and
only 10 percent less than in IS9_, which
was the banner year. This shows beyond
dispute that trade is improving.
As to the great staple?, iron is quieter,
as the recent increase in the demand
pushed production to a point exceeding
the inquiry. Wool has quieted down from
a similar cause, but continues steady
nevertheless. The sales last week were
49.737.000 pounds, against 23,327,000 pounds
in IS9'_, when all mills were running.
This doe* not look very dull.
Then there is the exhibit of failures.
Those last week showed a general de
crease in number, amount and average
of liability in almost every branch of
trade and manufacture, except cotton.
The week's failures were 228, against 267
during the corresponding week in 1896.
This is another good showing.
The feature of trade in California at the
moment is the hardening of prices caused
by the dry weather. Wheat ha* gone up
rapidly under heavy speculative trans
actions, and December touched $128 on
Saturday. The outlook for this great
staple is steadily improving. The condi
tion of the crop is poor the world over,
though no alarming deficiency is feared
anywhere. Still, it can now be said with
confidence that the California wheat
raiser will get more for his grain this year
than for several years back. This is grati
fying, for when wheat is profitable tbe
whole range of farm products is apt to
bring good prices. When the farmer is
prostrate the whole community lan
guishes.
The outlook for a good fruit year con
tinues brilliant. Except possibly peaches,
no deciduous fruit will be abundant, and
the destruction of the Eastern crop means
better than average returns to the fruit
grower this year. With a fine outlook for
wheat, wool and fruit. with mining active
and prosperous, it will be strange if Cali
fornia does not do well during 1697.
TRAFFIC FACILITIES.
The dependence of the trade of the
world on facilities of transportation makes
the calculations of experts in such mat
ters as to what may be accomplished in
the near future in the reduction of cost of
long-distance carrying a very encouraging
study. Particularly is this the case in regard
to what may b* expected in our own coun
try in the way of connecting the Middle
West with the seaboard and cheapening
the haul across the Nevada Mountains.
The present rapid development of trans
portation in other lands, whose resources
have long lain dormant, makes it of su
preme importance that the products of
our great Central West be enabled to reach
markets with low freights in order that
we may not be completely shut out in the
coming competition.
Particularly dangerous is going to be
the rivalry of Russia, who is now perfect
ing immense schemes in the way of im
proved facilities for traffic. Her great
Trans-Siberian Railway, connecting Eu
rope with the Pacific Ocean, the projected
canal to join the Baltic to the Black Sea,
and the developments of tho trans
casian communications, are enterprises
that are sure to affect our trade to a con
siderable extent, inasmuch as they will
bring Central Asia into competition with
us.
With the impending rivalry before us it
is gratifying to note that we shall make
progress not less than other nations. It
is estimated that with improved methods
of building, equipment and management,
our railroads could transport freight for
less than half the present cost and far be
low what canal conveyance would be.
The cost on some of the New York roads
now is as low as the tolls on the great Ge^
man Baltic canal, viz., 3.27 mills per ton.
It has been shown that by lessening the
grades and decreasing the rapidity of the
curves on the road freight could be carried
j from Chicago to New York for about $16
per carâ one engine hauling fifty-three
j cars of fifteen tons eachâ making the cost
j only \y_ mills per ton per mile, which
I would be about 3 cents per bushel for
j wheat. Had such improvements in grade
been made five years ago it is computed
tbat $500,000,000 would have been saved
i from the wreck of recent ruined or de
\ pressed railroad values. A route from the
Middle West to New York harbor, it is
calculated, could now be constructed with
such required grades and curves for
$25,000,000.
OI special interest to Californians is the
calculation that the grade of the Central
Pacific across the Nevadas, which is nom
inally 116, but in many pines really 12.5,
could be reduced to a maximum of sev
enty-five feet per mile lor the sum of
$3, 000,000, and the cost of hauling thereby
lessened 33 per cent. Considering the
vast expenditures now made in the trans
portation service of the road, it will bo
seen the amount estimated for the im
provement is very small in proportion to
the results to be attained.
COUNTY PAIfiS.
Since Governor Budd went to the pains
of denying the proposad appropriation
for county fairs in 1897, which was to be
paid out of the State treasury according
to a long established annual custom, there
has arisen in certain counties a conviction
deep and abiding that an omission of the
district fairs this particular year would be
in the nature of a national calamity. It
.may never before have occurred to them
bow absolutely indispensable those insti
tutions are, but the gubernatorial edict
against them immediately made prom
inent the fact that district** fairs are as
necessary as the very air we breathe.
Nothing can deter these certain coun
ties from holding fairs Ibis season. They
will bold them even though they have to
defray the expenses out of their | own
pockets or by county appropriations.
Movements are afoot in several districts
throughout the SiaU to this end, and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, /MONDAY, MAY 10, 181*7.
alreadyjthev can walk alone. They are
likely to be better fairs than have been
held in the same places for many years,
in view of the accentuated value which an
attempted abolition of them has caused
them to assume. Local pride, reaching
clear to the pockets of the patriots pro
fessing it, will hava an added effect. Peo
ple take more interest in tbe quality of
things which they buy themselves.
The county fairs held in California in
1897 will undoubtedly be splendid suc
cesses, and the circumstance that the cus
tom is to be carried on, despite the loss of
State appropriations, argues that the
country people bare all the time been sin
cere in tbeir enjoyment of its advantages,
and that they have the right kind of ap
preciation of it when they are willing to
pursue it on their own hook and at their
own expense.
OUE MERCHANT MARINE.
It is not easy to say just what should be
done for the revival of ihe American ship
ping, as there are grave impediments in the
way of the one-time simple remedy of dis
criminating duties; but the urgent neces
sity that something should be attempted
is made manifest by the histoty of the re
markable decline of our merchant marine.
Very few figures are necessary to show
how disoroportionate is the amount of
merchandise we carry across the ocean
when compared with our commercial
greatness. â  ./
When we first became a Nation the ton
nage carried by American shins was 123,
--893, and under the stimulus of discrimi
nating duties in the first quarter of a cen
tury it had increased to 854,295. Then be
gan a gradual abolition of the discrimina
tion?, the dates of the successive acts being
1815, 1817, 1324, 1828. In the forty years
before the abolition of the duties the per
centage of imports carried by our ships
had increased a little over five-fold and of
exports three-fold, the two together rep
resenting an enlargement of our tonnage
from less than a quarter of the whole to
nine-tenths of it.
In the single year 1829, after the total
doing away of the discrimination, there
was a fall from 757,998 tons to 592,859 tons,
and for a year or two the decline continued
at a rapid rate. Then began the im
mensely swift development of the coun
try, and the aggregate of tons swelled to
big figures in spit' of the lack of protec
tion to onr vessels; but while the total
tonnage became very large the percentage
of the whole trade which we handled was
still far short of what it should have been.
The climax of our ocean carrying was In
1861. when the tonnage reached 2,494,894,
but this was only 60 per cent of the whole,
and was a great drop from the 90 per cent
of tbe third of a century back. It sounds
strange, but it is true that American ves
sels carried less tons absolutely last year
than they did in 1815. We now bring to
the country in American bottoms only
about 15 per cent of the whole, and carry
out but B}i per cent.
So great and progressive a country as
this can never let thi_ matter rest until it
has solved the problem of how to revive
our carrying trade and make it commen
surate with our general prosperity.

JONES AND DAVIS
WERE THE STARS
They Took the Honors in
the Professional Cycle
Races.
Russ, the Olympic Club's Crack
Amateur, Outclassed His
Fields.
Speedy Racing at tha Velodrome
Track-Zi?gler Was Not Up to
a Bruising Race
Another cycle meet was held at the Velo
drome track yesterday afternoon under
the sanction of the California Associated
Cycling Clubs. Coulter, the noted profes
sional, did not ride, owing to illness.
Z.egler was not up to form, but Allan
Jones was in the pink of condition, and
Clarence Davis also made a fine showing.
E. F. Russ outclassed his fields in the am- '
ateur events and won as he pleased.
The day's racing opened with a two
thirds mile open, professional, run in two
heats and a final. In the first heat the
starters were Allan Jones, H. E. McCrea,
Ed Chapman and M. Bieuler. McCrea
jumped out in the third lap, and once in
the lead he was never headed. Jones was
hack in the last position, but by a hard
race captured the second place. Chapman
was third.
Otto Ziegler Jr., C. L. Davis, A. M. Boy
den and Bert Eiford came out for the sec
ond heat. Ziegler set the pace for
the first lap rather slow. Davis
and Boydeh exchanged the pace on the
second and third. Ziegler was last at the
bell lap, and had to ride around the
bunch high up on the bank. He made a
splendid sprint and won tho heat by a
margin of a few inches over Eiford. Davis
was third. It was a close decision, the
entire bunch finishing together.
This allowed Ziegler, McCrea, Eiford,
Jones and Davis into the final. Chapman
paced the race on a single. Ziegler was
first to catch the pacer, but Davis and
Eiford tried the old game of riding ahead
and dropping back aud forced Ziegler into
third place. ; _
From last position Jones started an
early sprint, which gave him the lead, and
then a battle royal ensued between the
entire bunch. It is said that Jones once
in the front is practically unbeatable, and
it proved so. for none of the others could
pass him. Ziegler fought him hard and
in a close finish with Davis was placed
third. The time was 1:26, close to the
record.
Chapman, Jones, Eiford, McCrea, Zieg
ler and Davis qualified for the two-mile
post race, professional, the conditions of
which were a $5 prize to the man first
cross the tape on each lap. The prelimi
nary heats were at one-naif mil**!.
The start was a pood one. Ziegler and
McCrea were first off and Ziegler won the
first lap. Jones took the second from Mc-
Crea, the latter won the third, and then
Ziegler assumed the lead again and won
three laps in succession. Davis made a
big jump on the next lap and secured
such a lead that he placed six straight to
his credit, the others being unable to over
take him. Ziegler was the only man who
tried to v catch him, and he could not do
it. Davis won the last mile of the race
after a splendid ride, the time being
4:41 3-5. Eiford was thrown on the tenth,
but escaped injury.
The heats of the mile amateur handicap
furnished some good sport. Russ, Olym
pic, won the first from Bozio, Imperial,
and Kraft, .Bay City, after a hard ride
from scratch, his time being 2:10, remark
ably fast-
Five started in the second heat and
made a pretty race of it. D. E. Francis of
the Road Club, from 60 yards crossed the
line first, a trifle ahead of Mott, Reliance,
who rode from scratch and would have
won if he could have got through the
bunch earlier.
Kraft and Robinson claimed they were
interfered with in the first heat, so Referee
Welch permitted them to start asain in
the third. The other starters were V. Veril
hac of Paris and Norton, Bay City. Rob
inson set most of the pace, but Norton
proved the speediest at the finish. Robin
son was second, Kraft third.
Mott and Russ on scratch, and Bozio,
Norton, Robinson and Sniitu at various
handicaps, started in the final. Robinson
had the lead and unwisely, made the pace
so slow that the scratch men soon caught
the field. Rusa went to the front when he
thought it about time, and stayed there.
Morton was a good second, and Mott, from
poor position in the rear, saw an opening
on the pole and rode into third place, just
beating Robinson. . 1 V

Father Gente'* Sermon on the Kecent
Great Catastrophe in Paris.
- A high mass for the repose of ihe souls
of the unfortunates who lost their lives
during the charity fair last week in Paris
was celebrated yesterday at tbe Church of
Notre Dame dcs Victoires, Pere Loude
celebrant, Pere Kouselon assisting.
The place of worship was crowded with
sympathizers, who listened to the short
and eloquent sermon of Abbe Gente.
"France weeps to-day and weep ye and
pray for those precious souls taken from
among their , families, friends and de
pendents by cruel fate," spoke the priest.
"At first glance," added, "it would
appear that happiness was not the reward
of virtue, when we consider bow mure
than 100 of onr compatriots were cutout
from hie while they were in the midst of
dispensing charity. ; This, no doubt, will
be the position taken by tbe disbelievers,
and even the faith of some of the disbe
lievers will be somewhat shaken by this
dreadful castastrophy.
"Tbis should not be the case, however,
for if God permits the righteous to suffer
it is only to recall them to him instructed
and purified -by tbeir v tribulation* - The

courage of the soldier is demonstrated ia
battle, so is the claim of heavenly reward
to be adjudged by the fortitude with which
we bear onr trials.
These trials but go to show how strong
is the foundation upon which is built the
edifice of our religion.
"We have before us a great lesson," said
the preacher, "which should make us hes
itate as we go through life and I think of
the path wherein we step. Then were
distinction, nobility of character, honesty,
virtue, talent and strength cut out of ex
istence by cruel fate in a few moments.
We -should ponder, therefore, before the
destroyer of all tnese attributes and ast
ourselves whether we are prepared to meet
our Maker." _

There was a remarkable temperance
rally by the Fourth District League of the
Cross Cadets at Metropolitan Temple yes
terday afternoon.
Colonel William P. Sullivan Jr. presided
over the deliberations of the body, and
tho afternoon passed away pleasantly
with musical and literary exercises. The
chief event was the competition between
five young orators for a silver medal,
which was awarded to E. j. Deasy of tit.
Mary's Parish. ,'.;,,".-. ":\- . :
Tho essays of all were prepared with
more than usual thoroughness, both as to
diction and delivery, and the judges

die was finally cast for Deasy because of
his more feeling and natural delivery.
The following were the contestants: E.

The Tavern of Castle Crag.
The Tavern of Castle Crag was built in
the heart of the Sierras, almost at the foot
of Mount Shasta, and amid the most pic
turesque mountain scenery accessible to
the tourist. The eligibility of the place
selected was due to a rare combination of
flowing water, inspiring mountain scenery
and inviting forests. â¢ â '?; -^
The Tavern of Castle Crag, with its
splendid environment, it was believed
would appeal chiefly to those who seek a
summer resort for health, recreation, out
door sports, sympathy with nature and
informal sociability. To emphasize this
intention and signify the kind of invita
tion extended, the name TAVERN of
Castle Crag was chosen.
To avoid all implication of sumptuous
accommodations or the tyranny of social
formalism and to realize this original con
ception, the management has decided to
make the Tavern of Castle Crag distinct-
ively a family resort and especially at
tractive to those to whom health, recrea
tion and sympathy with nature are
paramount considerations. To this end
rooms on the first and second floors of
this splendid tavern, with board, will be
furnished at a monthly rate of $65 a per
son; and rooms on the third floor, with
board, at a monthly rate of $50 a person.
The accommodations of the Tavern are
first class in every particular. Its parlors
and balls are elegant and spacious. Iv
verandas are cool and inviting, placing
the guest always in tbe presence of the
most attractive mountain scenery to be
enjoyed from the balcony of any tavern
in the world.
The opportunity for outdoor sports era
braces bunting, fishing, riding, bicycling,
walking on mountain paths and driving
on picturesque roads. The Tavern is lo
cated immediately on the main trunk line
of the California and Oregon Railroad, and
is fourteen hours' ride from Stockton, ten

Father Philip O'Kyan opened the enter
tainment with prayer, and Colonel Sul
livan delivered a brief address of welcome,
wherein be portrayed in a general way
the cost of intemperance, and gave the
League of the Cross great credit for its
work for good citizenship.
The general theme of every essay or
oration was "The Cost of Intemperance."
The speakers all considered the subject
with reference to the effect of drunken
ness on the individual as well as on
society.
They showed how the liquor habit un
dermines health, morals and mind, and
gave vivid pictures of the desolation of
homes and the desecration of all that
people ought to regard as high and holy.
Mr. McCarran showed that drunken
ness is not limited to any race, creed or
condition of men; that it eats away, on
all classes that are its victims remorse-
lessiy.
John F. Owens went deeply into the
historic phases of the problem and held
that drink primarily caused the fall of
Babylon.
E.J. Deasy, the winner of the silver
medal, held than when drunkenness en
ters society discord holds sway; that
liquor leads to crimes of every nature. He
said that the American people have spent
$26,000,000,000 for liquor in ninety years.
'â¢Drunkenness blights nope, deadens am
bition and paralyzes industry," he said,
"finally filling prisons, poorhouses and
asylums with its victims."
Francis Colligan made a stirring ad
dress, treating of temperance as it affects
the physical, moral and spiritual side of
man's nature. He quoted from Shakes
peare to show the picture of a perfect
man and drew a. strong portrayal of the
man ruined by liquor. Like the others,
he was loudly cheered. - *^"-
Joseph It. Care w was the last speaker.
His paper showed careful preparation and
abounded in useful statistics as to the ex
tent of the drink habit. He said it would
require ten men with scoop shovels to
throw away silver dollars as fast as the
American people spend tbem for drink,
and that the dollars spent each year, laid
in a row, would extend 1578 miles.
The Judges of the contest were: Miss
S. A. Grote, John O'Garaand T. It. Curtis.
While they were deliberating President
William F. Humphrey of the Cathedral
Council of the Y. M. I. made a good
speech on "Heroism." He dwelt on the
great value in modern times of dicipline,
perseverance and self-reliance, all of which
traits intemperance undermines. He held
that in this age of keen competition, more
than ever before, men have need to be
sober and in lull possession of their facul
ties. :.:â ;::: :j;:"jjj_
When the silver medal was pinned on
orator Deasy by Rev. Father O'Ryan there
was great applause, after which there was

/Four vessels, of tha sugar fleet are now
racing to Honolulu and the captain -of
tbe last one in has to put up for a dinner
for the otber three at the Royal Hawaiian
Hotel. The barkentine Planter, Captain
Dow, was towed out by the tug Vigilant
last Saturday night; the brig Lurline,
Captain McLeod, was towed out Friday
morning and the schooner Aloha, Captain
Dabel. and bark S. G. Wilder, Captain
McNeil, were towed out yesterday morn
ing. W^lCiJlii^ij^diQ
The Aloha in tow of the Reliance was
first away, and before the Vigilant had
the Wilder well under way had -cured a
lead of nearly three miles. The big
schooner was the heavier tow of the two,
and tbat was one thing in favor of the
crack Vigilant. The latter during the run
to the whistling buoy made up the three
miles leeway and had cast the Wilder off
and was on her way bacK to port before
the Reliance was ready to let go her tow.
Chief Engineer John English is more
than pleased with the performance of the
Vigilant, as he is only now getting over
the chagrin he felt at the beating the Re
liance gave his vessel seven months ago.
Captain Brokaw of the Reliance did not
take bis defeat very much to heart, as he
was trying to make easy weather of it for
Miss Daisy Dowd, who was on her way
back to her ' school on the Farallon

well, and a few more trips on the big tugs

MRS. BESANT'S FIRST TALK
She Tells Her Audience of the
Evolution of the
Soul.
Materia' ism Is He In ad quale to
Solve the Problem of
Destiny.
â  ', Â ,
Mrs. Annie Bezant lectured to a
thoughtful audience at Metropolitan Tem
ple last night, subject: "The Evolution
of the Soul."
Mrs. Besant is a pleasing talker, who
never hesitates for a word. Her voice is
deep and rich and her address abounded
in references to the facts of modern
science. :!::'*? r ' : \ ; "
She outlined the hopelessness of ma
terialism as a sane solution of the prob
lems of destiny, struck several hard blows
at the doctrine of heredity and concluded
that the only rational solution of the prob
lems of life is that put forth by theosophy.
"According to one view, of life," she
said, "all human destiny is settled in the
span between the cradle and the grave,
bat theosophy teaches that souls have ex
periences through hundred-, yes, thou
sands of lives, and that the saint and
criminal alike are a part of God."
Her analysis of the struggle that goes on
in the soul of one straggling to master
passion and weakness and need the lessons
of its oast experiences, was masterful. ..:
"The mind adds the memory of pleas
ure and of pain to its experience?," she
said, "and tue soul sits as a monitor to
warn the individual what to do."
Mrs. Besant' s great lecture on the sub
ject -will â be delivered .at Metropolitan
Temple on Thursday night. Manager Al
Marks says the sale of tickets is already
very, large.

WISDOM FROM THE SANCTUARY.
Words of Hope and Warning From Many City
Pulpits.
Rev. M. P. Boynton of the First Baptist
Church spoke on "Our Seventh-Day
Rest" His text was from Mark ii. 27.
"And he said unto them, the Sabbath
was made for man, and not man for the
Sabbath." He said in part :
Jesus had very clear notions concerning
the Sabbath question, and his views did
not always meet with favor at the hands
of tbe Jews. He saw that the most im
portant part in the God's great plan was
man himself, and not some day in the
measuring of time. The Sabbath, in
Christ's mind, was not a time in which
men were to be burdened with religious
observances, but a day in which burdens
of every kind were to be lifted. The
heart, in looking up to tho heavenly
Father, was not to be sad, but to rejoice in
the liberty wherewith Christ maKO3 free,
and to praise, as becometh the sons of
the resurrection.
In the institution of the Sabbath we see
something of the wonderful care God has
lor his creatures, the horse as well as man.
Here our physical, intellectual and moral
development is provided for. We are
taught that the Sabbath is the Lord's day.
It whispers rest in deeds of charity, lt
calls to meditation and prayer. On it
great congregations liftunited voices in
public worship. It speaks to us in ten
derest prophecy of the rest and peace that
await the children of God.
In its rightful observance is wrapped up
the destiny of our Nation. Protect this
great day against the polluting hand of
the unrighteous foreigner. On this day,
shut the gates of hell. by closing the un-
American, foreign born saloon. Give
every man liberty to commune with God
in the way that best suits bim, but tie the
hand of the ball-player, lock the gate to
every racing track, bank the fires of ail
excursion-train engines and steamboats.
The men who control the street railroads
in this town seem to care more for the
nickel than for their neighbor's good.
Some business must be carried on on the
Lord's day. Let us see to it that such
labor is only to help in the necessities and
not to aid in debauchery. Write over the
portal of every city, "We trust in God and
honor His day."

"Look That Thou Make
Them After the Pattern"
Rev. Oliver C. Miller, pastor of the
Church of the Holy Spirit, Jaceson street,
took "The Imperfect Church" as his
theme for the second of a series of ser
mons against the unscripturai methods of
the present-day church. He look his text
from Exodus xxv :_o: "And look that thou
make them after their pattern which was
showed thee in the mount." He said in
part :
"How sadly has the church of to
day fallen from the beautiful model
What a difference between church
lanity and Christianity. Is not the
church looking too little to lhe
inward spirit as the source of power, and
too much to outward lorm? The Pente
costal ideal is. 'or her the expression of the
mind of Christ, her living head; and her
only hope is her speedy return to the pat
tern given in the mount. It is ruinous to
apologize for the imperfect condition of
tha church by saying that it always has
been so, and always will be.
"Such a method wouid put an end to all
improvements toward perfection in arts
and sciences. There must be no lowering
of the standard. We must take warning
from God's effort to preserve the purity of
the apostolic church by the awful death of
Ananias and Sapphira. The disputes and
divisions of the latter apostolic church are
not to be taken as a precedent, but we
should aim to avoid them as abnormal de
velopments and cling to the Pentecostal
tern. Ecclesiasticism crucified Christ,
and it is stiil at it. Let us, like Moses, go
into the mount and be our forty days wuh
God in prayer, to get the pattern. The
purity ol the church niu-t begin with ihe
purity of tne individual under the trans
iortning grace of him who can make a man
every whit whole and who exhorts his fol
lower to be perfect."
The Hope and Faith
of the Christian.
Rev. W. A. Gardner of the West bide
Christian Church preached yesterday
from Koman3 viii, 24: "For we are saved
by hope." ln part he said :
"The Christian's hope is founded upon
faith. He believes that God is and that
he is the maker of ali things; tbat He is
infinite in wisdom and love; that he bas
made no mistake?, and that in some way
all things will work together for good to
those who serve him.
'â¢Many men are depending upon a false
hope, the sandy foundation of which is
belief that they can reform while con
tinuing in sin, or by their good works
without the Christ. Some believe that the
prayers of their friends or the mercy of
God will pass them through the gates of
pearl.
'It is painful for one to consider the loss
of liis property, the passing away of
golden opportunities, otto be deprived of
true friends,, but the saddest loss that can
come to a human soul is to be deprived of
hope. When hope is abandoned hell be
gins."
Christian Sympathy for
the Struggling Greeks
Rev. E. Nelander, the new pastor of the
First Lutheran Church, was ' one of the
many preachers of the land who yester
day expressed the sympathy of the Chris
tian world with Greece in her present
struggle with the Moslem. In preaching
on the subject, ''Our Indebtedness to
Greece," he dwelt on the debt of the
Christian world to Greece for her influence
in art and literature, and especially on the
debt of the Christian church to the lan
guage in which the New Testament was
written.
This was the second Sunday of Rev.
Mr. Nelander's new pastorate, to which
he has gone from the Swedish Lutheran
Church on Mission street. On Tuesday
evening the congregation will give a re
ception to Mr. and Mrs. Nelander in the
parlors of the church.
Sovereign Indications of
The Claims of Christ.
Rev. H. T. Ford of the First Christian
Church spoke on the subject, "Convic
tion," last night. In the course of his
remarks he said :
Truth, seen as truth, carries with it con
demnation to all those who refuse to wel
come it. The categories of sin, righteous
ness and judgment include all that is
essential in the determination of the re
ligious state of man,; and to these the worK
of, Paraclete is referred. His mission is
to convict the world in respect of these in
relation to Jesu***.'

pleted at his ascension, there was a com
plete exhibition of righteousness in rela
tion to God and roan. The son had re
ceived a work to do. His return to the
father was a token of its absolute fulfill
ment.
The world hitherto bad passed sentence
on success and failure according to us
own standard. At length this standard
will be overthrown. He in whom the
spirit of the world is concentrated will be
judged in the very act in which he seems
to triumph.
The history of the church and of the
world are the sovereign vindications of
the claims of Jesus.
"The Church and the Skep
tic," by Rev. Mr. Rader.
"The Church and the Skeptic" was Rev.
William Rader's subject at the Third Con
gregational church last evening. In part
he said:
"Skepticism is not due to the influence
of science on religion. Science has en
larged the field of faith. It is true that
evolution has made it necessary to read
just theology to its revelations, but skep
ticism is not a result of science. It is not
due to the proof or disproof of any partic
ular doctrine. The average man is indif
ferent to your argument for the Trinity or
the atonement or future punishment or
inspiration. If you succeed in proving
either or all of these, he would not be ma
terially changed. Skepticism is due to
tbe general elfect of popular thought of
the people upon faith. The contest is be
tween tbe life of the world and the faith of
the churcb.
"In, treating popular skepticism, the
church must be honest with honesty. We
must preach what we think and not think
one thing and preach another. We must
stand for something definite, but must not
conceal ourselves behind that for which
we stand. The church is a lamp, as a
soldier on guard, a light of the world. As
such it is splendid and heroic, but it is siso
an active progressive force, a discoverer of
truth, a pioneer in science, a progressive
revelation. ,Man must be asked not to be
lieve as little as possible, but as much
as possible. This belief must not
consist of fragmentary and separate doc
trines. A man's belief is the canvas
which he spreads to the wind. * Men who
do not believe very much are like vessels
with naked masts, but men cannot be ex
pected to believe much unless their faith
centers in a unity.* Faith must . attach it
self to life.
"Skepticism is iucreased or diminished
by our instruction of childhood. We reap
what we sow in the Sunday-school. If
you tell children the earth is flat and they
discover that, it is round then they will
forever doubt your astronomy. It is ab
solutely necessary to be honest with the
child.
"Nothing baa increased doubt in
the minds of men so much as the
tearing of he seamless robe of Christ. It
is the lack of intellectual comity. A
divided thought has made sects. It is not
expected that all men will think alike.
It is not desirable. But if it is right te
have a treaty of arbitration between Eng
land and America it is equal. right to
have a spirit of comity between denomina
tions. It is wrong to build a sect upon a
non-essential. Bigotry is unrighteous
ness. Men will be less skeptical when
every church spire represents a funda
mental truth."
Selfishness Silenced.
A Parable of Jonah.
Rev. H. T. Shepard delivered a strong
sermon yesterday at the Olivet Congrega
tional Church.
His subject was "Selfishness Silenced."
He text was, "Arise, go to Nineveh, that
great city and cry against it, for their
wickedness is come up before me.'' â
Jonah, i, 2. -f
He took the parable of Jonah to illus
trate his subject. He went on to speak of
J-jii ill's objection and hesitation iv going
to Ninevah to warn the people of their
impending doom, as Jonah feared his
words would lead the people to rep-nt
and so escape puni-hment.
The Lord directed him to go and he
preached, and the sinners repented and
were saved, and in their salvation re
buked Jonah for his selfishness.
m
Salaam Sent from
Ancient Jerusalem.
Madame Lydia Finkeistein Moantford
was introduced by Rev. Dr. Case at the
Howard street Methodist church last
night as "a genuine oriental." She gave
an eloquent and interesting talk about her
native city of Jerusalem and the condi
tions of the East to-day. She states that
the expression "peace be with you," used
by Christ and enjoined upon his disciples,
is still the customary greeting in Jerusa
lem, and in these words, most dramatic
ally uttered, she brought the message of
the East to the people of the West.
There is a great similarity in the polit
ical condition of Jerusalem at the present
time to that which prevailed in the days
of Christ. The Arabs there and in Judea
hate their masters, the Turks, just as the
old Jews used to hate the Romans.

The Chutes will be open as usual to-night to
the lovers of out-of-door attractions, ana there
is much to attract at this place. One of the fea
tures that seems to be an always drawing card
is the animatoscope. The scenic railway has
unusual attraction for many.
An electric mousetrap is . something
new. A bit of cheese is attached to an
electric wire. The mouse or rat, to get at

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 10, 1897.
FORESTERS VIED
TO DO HIM HONOR
Thousands Attend the
Funeral of Grand Sec
retary Bremer.
A Very Touching Incident During
the Singing ot" I Am
Going Home."
Eulogy by C P. Rend on of Stock ten.
The Body Taken to Odd Fellows'
Cemetery for Cremation.
Fully 5000 people assembled within and
outside of B'nai B'riih Hall, on Eddy streot,
yesterday afternoon, to pay the last tribute
of respect to the memory of the late Chris
tian Herman Bremer, who for nine years
prior to bis sudden death in the Grand
Court of the Foresters, in Marysviile, last
week, was grand secretary of the order.
The iar.e ball on the main floor and the
gallery were crowded until there was no
longer any standing-room, and an im
mense crowd stood npon the street in
front of the building waiting until they
could have an opportunity to enter.
The casket in which reposed the remains
rested on trestles in the center of the hall
and at the head there were many beauti
ful contributions of flowers.
The mother and the sister of the de
ceased, the chief mourners, accompanied
by intimate friends, were escorted to seats
by the marshal, S. R. White, the grand
treasurer of the order; then followed the
colors draped in mourning, escorted by two
knights iv full uniform, and after these
came a procession of courts and circles
until no more could be admitted.
The service commenced with the chant
ing of a hymn by the Knickerbocker quar
tet, after which "the Rev. Julius Fuendel
ing, pastor of St. Mark's German Evan
gelical Lutheran Church, ottered a prayer.
The quartet chanted "The Lord's Prayer,"
after which Judge C. P. Ken ion of Stock
ton, past grand chief ranger, spoke of the
life and services of the deceased, during
which he alluded to him as "a man with
out a foe, who was ever ready to assist by
word or deed, one who set an example
that all ought to profit by." The quartet
then sang "Nearer,[my God, to Thee"; the
Rev. Mr. Fuendeling addressed words ol
consolation to the relatives of the de
ceased; the quartet rendered "Thy Will
be Done," and Grand Chief Ranger J. S.
W. Saunders read from the burial service
of the order, after which which the quar
tet sang "Good Night, I'm Going Home."
As the voices standout in the sweetest
tones the words "Good night, I have
reached my home, good night," they
seemed to have touched a sympathetic
chord in every breast for there were tears
in the eyes of hundreds in the hall.
That closed the service, after which all
those present took a parting look
at the face of the dead man. A pro
cession, preceded by a band of music, was
reformed and tho remains were taken to
the Old Fellows' Cemetery, where the
rest of the burial service was held by the
grand court officers and the body was
placed in the incinerating furnace and
cremated. :V* !
There were present delegations from
Sacramento, Nevada City, Grass Valley,
Red Bluff, 'Alameda and other places
around the bay.
The pallbearers were: J. E. Cox of
Watsonville, H. E. Schmidt of Marys
viile, J. F. Greenough of Los Angeles,
Julius Colmann, J. M. Lackey, J. F. Hal
lett and Sol Pieser of San Francisco, rep
resenting the Foresters, and George F.
R-ckand E. Wilson representing the
Knights of Pythias. '*Â,:

-Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station Indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it. if any. the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect po!nÂ°s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hleh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to" low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloud y weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the com... and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" in ihe vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

GETTING ANXIOUS
When the Racing Season
Is Over, What Will
B3 Left ?
Income Largely Derived From
t! c Men Connected With
the Track.
Nearly Al the Saloons Will HiVt
to Close Because of the Lack
of Patronage.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
â¢JOS Broadway, May 9. f
Residents of Emeryville are looking
forward with lone faces to tne close of the
racing season with ihe Oakland Derby on
May _'-. The town was created primarily
for the purpose of maintainig a racetrack
within its borders which should be inde
pendent of the jurisdiction of the Super
visors. The incorporation proceedings
were rushed through more rapidly than
any other similar proceedings in this
county. Everybody wanted Emeryville
to be a town, and they wanted it quickly.
The town was made and during the six
months of the racing season everything
prospered and the grass was long and
green. Now the problem arises, What is
the town to do during the six months
when stables will be vacant, jockeys and
horsemen will be on the Eastern circuit
and there is no daily crowd attracted to
tue racetrack?
A large portion of the income of the
town is derived from saloon licenses, but
saloons cannot flourish on the small resi
dent population of Emeryville and during
the next six months there will be no float
ing population. There will be some
horses at the track all the time, but noth
ing like the number there at present.
One of the town officials said this week
that it is very easy to run a busy town,
but to run an idle one is a task that the
trustees look forward to with zest.
It is certainly unfortunate for those
who are continually opposing the sugges
tion that the three cities on this side of
the bay should incorporate that every
public question that arises should be
turned involuntarily into an argument
for consolidation.
For over a month Oakland and Ala
meda have been advocating the connec
tion ot the two cities by a tunnel beneath
the estuary. One side desires it as much
as the other, and the un_,nswerab.e argu
ment is made that a tunnel is almost a
"necessity if mm h shipping it to come into
the harbor. The legal conditions, however,
are not favorab c to a tunnel because part
of the project would be in one town and
part in anotner and the Supervi-ors have
no authority in the premises. If the three
cities were consolidated and Greater Oak
land were a reality there would be no con
flict between municipalities and the
county government, but the whole affair
would be in the hands of one governing
body, which could do as it pleased.
Another quesiion now bein_ considered
i? the maintenance of the Receiving Hos
pital. There is some legal doubt as to
whether the institution should be sup
ported by the city of Oakland or the !
county of Alameda. It is at present a
charge on the county and receives patients
irom every town in the county. Alameda
wants a receiving hospital of its own and
is o. : the opinion that the county should
supply it. This is very reasonable, lor
Alameda should have an emergency hos
pital nearer than the present one, but is
not likely to get it by trying to make it
appear that Oakland should pay ior the
present institution.
Should the two towns be consolidated
as nature intended they shou d this whole
matter cond be settled at one meeting of
the city government, and what is true of
these two instances is true of many others.
The past week has been one of lively
policy at the City Hall. Aside from the
unhappy scandal connected with the
Health office there are other deals being
made wnich reflect no credit on those con
cerned in them. At the present time
Mayor Thomas and City Attorney Dow,
tbe Republican members of the Board of
Works, are a majority against City En
gineer Clement. Clement would like to
make some changes in the beads of de
partments, but cannot do so alone, and
-he cannot at Dresent form an allegiance
with either of the Republicans, being a
Democrat.
It was once officially announced that A.
M. Benham, the real-estate partner of the
Mayor, was to be Superintendent of Streets
and that Fred A. Campbell was to be
placed in charge of the Fire Department.
Both of these appointments have been
temporarily laid on the table, hut they

are not dead. Benham, who worked hard
for Thomas, deserves recognition, butcan
not at present get the vote of Mr.lJiw.
Clement would like Camnbell in the Fire
Department, but Mayor Thomas is not yet
ready to vote with him, and Dow does
not favor a change.
There is only one thing that can bring
about the desired result, and that is a rais
understa tiding between Thomas and Dow,
which would force the Mayor into a
coalition with the Democratic member.
Then the two could control all the pa
tronage, and there no doubt that speedy
changes would follow. At present Mr.
Dow declares that there is no reason why
any of the Republican officials should be
removed, con-ddering that they are all
doing their duty and giving no cause for
complaint. Under th- Republican muni
cipal platform all Republican officials
were guaranteed being retained in office
so long as there was no legitimate cause
for their removal, and so far, with the
single exception of the Health Board
scandal, this platform haÂ« been upheld.

BACCALAUREATE SERMON-
Professor Baco 1 Treachea to the Gradu
ates at Berkeley.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 9.â Professor
Thomas R. Bacon preached the baccalau
reate sermon this afternoon to the class of
'97 in the First Congregational Church.
There was a large congregation present,
including many of the faculty of the uni
versity.
The professor read two t its. One was
"Where Is "Wisdom and Wnere Is the
Place of Understanding?" and the other
"What Is Man That Thou Art Mindful of
Him?" The discourse was an eloquent
sermon, and in answer to the query pro
pounded Professor Bacon said that
while men are so small that a thousand
million whirl through space on a speck of
dust, yet the faculties that comprehend
ihevastitudts of the universe are evidence
of divine capacity.
"The place of understanding is the hu
man Â»oul, : ' said the speaker. "One thing
we know with certainly and one only.
Amid all diversity and confusion there is
this ons certain thingâ the eternal differ
ence between right and wrong. This
knowledge is all that is essential. All
other knowledge is subsidiary. The truths
of rcience are useful only as they aid us
to see the everlasting distinction between
risht and wrong and to act on our knowl
edge." __rÂ£W -v";
Professor Bacon closed with eloquent
and touching words of counsel to the
graduates.

DEATH CAME EASILY.
Supposed Suicide of Mrs. Olive
L. Â£p ddy From Inhaling
Chloroform.
A Bottle Was P aced B-> ween the Bed
Coverlets to Facilitate Breathing
cf the Anesthetic.
ALAMEDA, Cat*, May 9.â Mrs. Olive
L. Speddy, the wife of Samuel A. Speddy
of 92. Santa Clara avenue, was found
dead in bed this morning at about 6
o'ciock. The circumstances surrounding
her death are such as to lead the disinter
ested one to the conclusion^ that lhe case
Is one of suicide with chloroform admin
istered while suffering from nervous pros
tration, to which she was subj ct.
The deceased was a native of New York,
aged 39 years and 9 months, and was
prominent in this city in the woman suf
frage movement Mr*. Speddy has for
some time been a sufferer from attacks of
nervous prostration. Since her death the
admission is reluctantly made that while
laboring under such periodical attacks it
was customary for the members of her
household to set a watch on her that she
might not do herself . violence. Last
night she attended an entertainment
in San Francisco and did not return home
until 1 o'clock this morning, by the last
train. Mrs. Speddy was complaining of
prostration before she reached home. She
retired to bed and this morning was found
a corpse in bed to the great horror of the
husband.
Howard Speddy, a young man who
lives in the house, is authority for the
statement that about 4 o'clock this morn
ing be heard Mrs. Speddy up and about
her room and the supposition is that it
was then that she ariangea the chloro
form bottle for the fatal inhalations. The
act that she was addicted to the use of
chloroform to soothe her nerves was a
revelation to the family. However, when
the discovery of her death was made a
sponge that had been saturated with chlor
oform was found on the floor near the bed
side. The bottle itself was discovered be
tween the coverlets and bo held In a fixed
place by their weight that the aperture
would be close to her nostrils and facili
tate inhalation without disturbing her
position in bed. An inquest will be held
to-morrow nilernoon.
Surviving her are the widower and two
daughter-. Mrs. Speddy was a woman of
vivacious temperament, who had a de
voted husband and family, and was sur
rounded by all the refining influences. No
reason can be assigned for suicide, there
fore, unless that the act was committed
when out of her mind during one of these
periodica! depressions and prostrations.
These had become so alarming of late that
she sought medical treatment for them no
later than last Tuesday. Even under the
circumstances noted the family is inclined
to the belief that her death was accidental,
for cause for her taking her life there was
none.

ALAMEDA'S OPERA
HOUSE IN ASHES
It Caught Fire Last Night
and Was Totally
Destroyed.
The Owner Estimates That His
Loss Will Amount to
About $12,500.
An Investigation Will B? Made, as
I Is Thought an Incendiary
Is R.sponsib'.r.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 9. âA black
mound of ashes and charred timbers
is all that remains of J. C. Lkider
man's Alameda Opera-house. It caught
fire in some mysterious manner last
nieht at 10:15 o'clock and in an hour was
a heap of glowing embers.
The flames were first noticed by J. E.
Carey, who resided in the theater, licking
their way up one of the rear stairways on
the second story. After trying to extin
guish the blaze he hurried from the build
ing and sounded an alarm.
The department responded to the call
quickly, but as the flames gained headway
with astonishing rapidity in the frame
building it seemed a useless task to at
tempt to save 11.
A general alarm was then sounded and
after a few minutes several streams of
water were pouring on the flames.
A hydrant a short way distant from the
theater burst and ore of the entities was
left useless for a time, giving the fire a
chance. In ten minutes from tho lime of
tbe accident the building was a mass of
leaping flames and the entire city of Ala
meda was aglow in the flood of light.
The department then gave its attention
to adjoining property, to prevent the fire
from spreading, and in consequence t.e
opera-house was the only building seri
ously damaged.
Linderman Opera-house was built five
years ago at a cost of $12,500. It was in
sured lor $5000. The upper floor of the
theater building was occupied by a G. A.
K. post and several lodges, and the Ala
meda Cyclers Club rooms^were below. The
paraphernalia and furnishings were totally
destroyed. ffifP^MBw^TJWB
Miss C. C. Wahl, who conducted a res
taurant on the lower floor, also lost several
hundred dollars' worth of property in the
fire.
Mr. Carey thinks that the fire was of in
cendiary origin and a searching investiga
tion will be made.

COMRADE HILL'S
DESIRE DENIED
Anxious to March With
Lyon Post on Memo
-r rial Day.
But His Little Mound Will Be
Decorated by Those Leit
Behind.
- â
Hundreds of Veterans and Firemen
Attend the Simple Funeral of
the Old Soldier-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,?
908 Broadway, May 9. [
There was an unusual tinge of sorrow at
the funeral of Veteran James Hill, who
was buried by his comrades in the sol
diers' plat this afternoon.
Memorial day is not far off, and Com
rade Hill had expressed a strong desire to
take part in the exercises at the plat on
that day. He was a member ol Lyon
Post, G. A. R., and last year, owing to
what is now called a misunderstanding
and which will probably soon be called a
mistake, Lyon Post was suspended from
the Memorial day exercises. '.'
This grieved the old soldier, for be real
ized that, with bis eightieth year of life
fast approaching, it could not be long be
fore he would be sleeping where the four
howitzers keep guard at Mountain View,
and the duty would devolve on his com
rades of seeing tbat bis little mound re
ceived its sbar of flowers. ',
For many years Comrade Hill was chap
am of Lyon Post, and to-day the mem
bers of that body and many other G. A. R.
men attended the ceremonies and went to
the plot in special cars.
The deceased was also an old fireman,
and the fire laddies turned out iv uniform
also, and the procession - going out New
Broadway presented a strong contrast to
the thousands of pleasure-see Iters who
were journeying to â¢- the out-of-town re-
sorts. *â *-â  * -"-':'â â 
James Hill was at one time Chief of the
Fire Department of this city, and at the
time of his deatn was the oldest ex-chief
in the .-_ United States. : Sixty years
a*o be was a member of tue "White
Ghost" Fire Department engine company
of New York. Wnen the war broke out
Hill enlisted in tbe First Ohi > Voiuntee rs
ml took part in the famous tt^bt at Bull
Hun. He came to OaKiand twenty-two
years ago and j lined the Fire Department
and for the past sixteen years has been
night watchman at the City Hall and
twice saved the old structure from fire.
The Q. A. R. ceremoniei were held at
Loring Hall and were largely attended by
firemen and veterans.

MANY PARK ACCIDENTS.
The Cliff Honse Hereafter Will Be-
serve Its Galleries for Patrons
â Who .Pay.
Yesterday was an eventful day for the
park in the way of small accidents, and
the physicians at the ambulance station
were kept busy.
One of the mishaps came very near be
ing a serious disaster. T. Nolan, the lum
ber man, was out driving with nis wife
and wuen near the racetrack a strap of the
harness broke. The hor.e began to kick
and plunge and swerved on to ahisli
hank. The occupants of the cart were
thrown out. Nolan's right arm was dislo
cated at the sliou.der, but Mrs. No. an
who, as she expressed it, "dropped out
very neatly," escaped unhurt. save fora
tew scratches.
A most cowardly attack was made on F.
Stafford of 334 Twel.lh street as he was
returning home from the baseball ground.
He had stopped a fi_ht between two play
ers earlier in the >.ay, and some one, pre
sumably for revenge, slipped up beh.nd
him and dealt him a heavy blow on the
head with a bat, and then ran away.
Stafford's injury is not serious.
Those who met with minor accidents
were: Entile Lantern of 13 Auburn street,
R. chard Rogan of 3111 Sixteenth street,
George M-honey of 3111 Sixteenth street,
Ernest Cr_w 01 711 Suotwell street, Gerald
Jones of 1617 Pine street and Mrs. Enras
of the Clifford House, who fainted at the
music stand.
Harry Forrester was arrested for fast
driving. A mounted olhcer dished up
and caught the offender's big bay by the
head and jerked mm to a standstill.
At the Sutro baths the L.tniunt family
of girl and boy gymnasts peiforrued some
pretty feats.
The Cliff House has shut down on the
economical crowd of people who have been
in the habit of enjoying the galleries and
the music out there, but never spending a
cent to help the management pay the
rent. Henceforth those who use the two
upper galleries must .spend at least a dime
in some department of the house.
At the Chutes the Monaghan Social and
Benevolent Society enjoyed an outing.
STABBED IN THE BREAST.
William llcli Miipiini Seriously Wounded
by â milk scott l..ti<- Lust
.Kveiiiiig.
Ten copper 1-cent piece", offered in pay
ment for two glasses of beer, led up to an
altercation in the Senate saloon, corner of
Pine and Kearny streets, at 11:30 o'clock
last ni.ht. which culminated in the fatal
stabbing of William Behrmann, proprietor
of the saloon, by Frank Scott, a telegraph
operator.
Scott, accompanied by a friend, entered
the saloon and walking up to the bar
called for two beers. They were placed on
the bar, and S.ott tossed out ten cupper
cents in payment. Behrmann refused to
accept the pennies and demanded a silver
10-cent piece.
According to an onlooker Scott uttered
a few oath â¢ and said that the copper*
were legal tender and must be accepted.
At this Behrmann started around the
bar toward the telegraph operator, but as
the latter drew a knife he retreated to a
sale position.
Suddenly Scott picked up a beer glass
and hurled it at the saloon-keeper, who
then picked up a club and started toward
Scott. Scott backed out into the street
followed b. Behrmann.
There was short light between the two
men and B-hrmann reeled back the blood
flowing from a deep wound in his right
breast. Scott hurried into an adjoining
saloon and was there found by a police
man, who placed him under arrest and
booked him at the California-street Police

A.H. PAPE BREAKS
SEVERAL RECORDS
Phenomenal R ih- Shooting
of a Young Native
Son.
He Beats the Best Fifty and
Ten Shot Scores of the East
and West.
A Large Attendance rf Sharpshooters
and Military Marksm.'n at
Shell Mound
A. H. Pape of the Columbia Pistol and
Rifle Club broke the coas*. rifle record yes
terday in a match at the Shell Mound
rifle range. More than this, he outshot
the best records of several of the crack
Eastern marksmen. His success was, in
fact, a triple victory, for he not only out
shot his adversary, but his shooting sur
passes the best fifty-sho: and ten-shot
records ever made on the Columbia tar
get. In all probability his second run
of ten shots beat the best single
score of the United States, made by
Pope in New Haven, Conn. It
was a great day for Pape. The
match he shot in was a handicap with C.
M. Duiss, the champion pistol shot of the
coa*Â»t. Daiss allowed Pape 75 points in
fifty shots, Pape to shoot the rifle at 200
yards, Daiss to shoot the pistol at 50 yards.
The handicap was too great.
The match was for a small considera
tion, but in addition Pape was obliged to
shoot on the club's Bunnell medal and
Daiss on the Young rifle record. Thus
the scores are official. Daiss' scores of ten
shots Â« ach were 72, 46. 60, 43, 45â total 266,
Columbia target. Rape's .-boo ing, same
conditions, were Â«3, 37 47, 52, 50â total
249- In other wonts, he averaged his fifty
snots in a 4 and 49-50 inch circle. His
second score of 37 was an average of ten
shots in a 3 7-10 inch circle. These records
will be appreciated when it is remem
bered tbat the young man snot off-hand
at 200 yards, which equals double-rest
shoot in Pape shoots No. 1 smoke
less rifle powder, an explosive that tbe
Eastern marksmen declare cannot be
relied upon.
F. O. Young's seven in three shots
equals the best score made so far. The
other scores were as follows:
Rifleâ Re-entry matches, open to all comers,
300 yards, Columbia target, F. H. Bushnell

REAL ESTATE REVIEW.
Indications That Prices Are as
Lew as They Will
Drop.
Important Auction Sals of Downtown
Prop.rty Scheduled for the
20th Inst.
The real estate market is struggling to as
sert Itself in these days of promise against the
odds of the approach of summer and a condi
tion of trade, which in this peculiar line has
been more depressed during the past year
than at any time since the slump which foL
lowed the railroad boom in the '60s . That
the market Is liable to experience a revival
before long there is every reason to believe.
Those who have believed hitherto that all
they had to do was to name their prices and
wait for the seller to come down to it are now
beginning to realize that they have been wait
ing in vain. Prices will not jump up, but on
the other hand they will go no lower, and
those who intend to buy cannot do belter
than make up their minds that they will have
no better opportunity than the present, lt is
a very old saying that to buy when the mar
ket is down and to tell when it is up is the
way to get rich. The fact that prices are now j
down must be patent to every one who pays J
any attention to realty; the inlerence, there
fore, that this is the time to invest is obvious.
The principal sale in City property effected
during the past week was the transfer of tbe
Bay City Market property, on Market street,
near Taylor. The lot nasa frontage o! 50 feet
on Market running back to Turk street, with
a frontage of 47:6 feet on the latter thorough
fare. The price realized was $200,000.

DEATH IN
SLEEP ENDS
A BUSSY LIFE
Capitalist William B. Carr
Asphyxiated by Gas
in His Home.

OPEN.
Carr Cut a Large Figure in the
Politics and Development
of California.
HE SENT SARGENT TO THE
SENATE.
The Guiding Ginins of the Great
Ha.gin and Carr Land and
Irrigation Enterprise.
William â¢ B. Carr, . the widely known
capitalist who has cut a considerable |
figure in California history. was found
dead in his bed by his family yesterday
morning, asphyxiated by gas which es- !
caped during the night from a jet which
the deceased had accidentally left partly
cpen.
Mr. Carr had during the day and even
ing before been immersed in the business
and personal affairs of a very busy, suc
cessful and happy life. He retired for the
night iv good health and spirits, with en
gagements for the next and the following
day before him, and after his last words
to members of his family about a pleasure
trip in the morning he prefaced sleep with
looking over some business papers of im
mediate concern. It was under these cir
cumstances that death came in his sleep.
The deceased was a yet vigorous man of
67 years, kept busy by 1 is very extensive
land and mining operations, with which
he was concerned as usual down town Sat
urday. One of the things he :ad in hand
was a scheme nearly formulated to go into
the extensive raising of sugar beets on one
of his tracts of land in Kings county, and
early in the aiternoon be and his friend
and attorney, M. M. Estee, lunched on
Pine street with some gentlemen inter
ested in the enterprise. When he left his
office and the street for the day he had
made an important business engagement
for 10 a. M- of Monday at Mr. Estee's office,
Going to bis new home at the north
east corner of Broadway and Fillmore
street he dined as usual with his faiftily
and passed the evening pleasantly. He
went early to his bedroom for the night,
after having arranged for a little pleasure
outing with his wife on Sunday mornin_,
with the understanding t; at Mrs. Carr
would have him called at a certain time.
About 10 o'clock his wife, who was in the
habit of sleeping in another apartment,
went to his room and finding him reading
THE LATE WILLIAM B. CARR.
n bed withdrew for the night without
putting out th. lights.
It had long been Mr. Carr's habit to
read in bed frequently after retiring on
account of a slight tendency to insomnia.
For this reason a study lamp was kept on
a little table at the head of his bed. This
lamp be used as usual that night.
According to the account given, Mrs.
Carr was up at about 7 o'clock yesterday
morning and noticed a smell of .as. She
immediately knocked loudly at her hus
band's door, which it was his habit to
lock, and receiving no reply quickly
opened a window to tne room in great
alarm. In a few moments other members
of the family were on hand and the room
entered as soon as the exit of the gas
made it possible.
Mr. Carr was lying in tbe bed insensible ;
and in tbe position of sleeping. Efforts to
arouse him made it apparent tbat death
had come, though .he body .- was still
warm. The family physician,* Dr. George
H. Palmer, and Dr. C. B. Brigham, who
lives elope by, were summoned and soon
came. Every effort to restore life was
lruitloÃs and at 8:30 a m. the Morgue was
notified of the deaih. - %'.
The room gave clear evidence of what
had occurred. At one side of the I room
was a bureau containing many of Mr.
Carr's business papers and it was a wall
gas jet near it which bad been left open.
Papers concerning some business affair
in hand which had been taken from the
bureau were by the bed with a newspaper
which nad also been read. The gas jet
was open about one-third way. After
Mrs. Carr had retired he had gone to the
bureau, lighted the gas and taken out the
papers to look over. When he finally put
out his lamp to go to sleep he had mis
takenly lelt the gas jet open a little and
during the night the gas had accumulated
THE CONVICTS THANKED THE ARCHBISHOP.
Sixty-two grim-visaged, sbor t-croppcd convictsâ men who for years had defied their Maker and persistently clung to the thorny path
of crimeâ their faces heavenward in the little San Quentin chapel and acknowledged the omnipotence of God. They were confirmed
in the faith of the Catholic church and promised that their future shall be one of repentance, one of praise for the Creator, one of prayer
lor mercy It was the triennial visit of Archbishop Riordan to the penitentiary to uplift the fallen souls and direct them to the highway
of righteousness. The men in stripes filled every seat and stood in the aisles of the chapel, for there were others there besides the qualfied
candidates for confirmation. There were over a hundred present to receive communion. High mass inaugurated the impressive cere
monies In this Rev. Father P. E. Mulligan, secretary to the Archbishop, officiated. The Archbishop himself participated, too, as did also
Father Lagan ol San Rafael, who has charge of the work of Catholic conversionÂ«at San Quentin prison. Appropriate music was furnished
by the prison band and a select choir. After this ceremony was over and just as Archbishop Riordan arose to address the assembled con
victs and extend to them the balm of communion, a man in prison garb approached the reverend gentleman and bade him listen to what
he was going to say. This man was Timothy Whalen, once a hardened and apparently unredeemable criminal, but now saved and con
verted. He presented the Archbishop with a set of resolutions expressing the thanks of the convicts for the interest taken in them and
their welfareâ also their reverence for him, and their promises to profit by his teachings- Then the Archbishop spoke:
"I obey the law of the land which binds me with cfvll obligations," he said, "but beyond this I receive divine command. I can say to
yon as to all others, as the Apostle says: 'Be obedient for conscience's sake.' In civil life we find ourselves under the government of society,
which has divine sanction. We belong to society for the good of our souls. Almighty God wished the word of salvation not to be a diffi
cult one He came to save all menâ for all men. He stretched out his arms on the cross for all men, and to make the way of salva
tion easy. The way is easily marked. Bear In mind always the conditions that surround salvation. When the lawyer asked the Master,
â¢What shall Ido that I may enter into lif.?' the reply was, 'Keep the commandments of God.' To these ten commandments are all men
subject."

George C. Carr, the elder son, who re
sides elsewhere and who had dined there
the evening before, was quickly summoned
and the daughter who nves in Louisville
and other friends were early notified.
The surviving members of the family
are Mr*. Carr, two sons, George G. and
Ralph M. Carr, and the daughter, Mrs.
Louis Leih of Louisville, Ky. The de
ceased bad no other relatives on the
coast.
The funeral will probably occur on
Tuesday or Wednesday. The services
will be held at the house and the inter
ment will be private. It is known that
there is a will, made some time ago, di
viding the estate among the family.
The value of the estate cannot be defin
itely given, but it will 'probably amount
to several hundred thousand dollars. It
consists primarily of very large tracts of
land in various counties in Central Cali
fornia, and secondarily of mining inter
ests, chiefly acquired during very recent
years.
Two years ago Mr. Carr sold bis inter
est- in the vast H.iggin and Carr domain
in Kern County, from which his business
fame has chiefly risen, so that the estate
has no concern with Kern County. '
One group of land holdings comprising
about 20,000 acres lies in Alameda, Contra
Costa, Yolo and Butte counties. Second
in importance is a great tract in Kings
County and there are smaller properties
elsewhere. In this City the home at
Broadway and Fillmore street occupied a
year ago and the old Carr home out on San
Jos? avenue are the only real properties.
Mr. Carr always 'labeled in mines and after
the sale of his Kern County interests* he
inve-ted in them more largely. The most
important now are the Glover in Amador
County and the Good Hope in Plumas
j County, the former a quartz and the latter
: a gravel mine. In recent years his son,
I George G. Carr, ha.*' been associated with
| him in the management of all his business
j enterprises.' â 'â â 'â  J '.-J â â¢'
William B. Carr cat a prominent' fi**ure
in California affairs j for over a generation. I
j Two features of his career stand out prom
inently. One was his political dominance
of the Republican party in this State dur
ing Grant's administration Â»p ; and the as
cendency of Senator Sargent. The other
was the stupendous scheme of the acquire
ment, irrigation and settlement of a
princely domain of i 400,000 - acres of arid
yalley in Kern County, of '.which success
ful scheme he was the originator and the
guiding genius.
1 His birth occurred in 1830, in Clark i
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL MONDAY, IVI AY 10, 1897.
County, Ind., at the old family home six
miles from Louisville, Ky., across the
river. Hi-- father was a contractor and
builder in that city, and the deceased
grew up in that business. After the panic
of 1837 there was a removal to Cincinnati.
In 1853, some time after the death of his
father, he abandoned Cincinnati and came
to California.
He mined for a while at Indian Creek,
north of Marysviile, in El Dorado County
and at Michigan bar, and then went into
business as a contractor and builder at
Sacramento in partnership with Stephen
Winans, William Alien and R. C. Redd.
The firm later became \Vinans & Carr, and
after 1860, when Ayinans died, Carr carried
on the business alone.
Mr. Carr built many of the important
structures of that city, and among his con
tracts was one on the foundation of the
catdtol buildine. After the floods of
1862-63, he and William Turton built the
levees about Sacramento. \
During his Sacramento career he took
an active interest in politics. In January,
IÂ£G4, he was mnrriea by Thomas Starr
King to Miss Lizzie Macy of this City, a
descendant of one of the original founders
of the Nantucket colony, and later in that
year he located in San Francisco.
He became interested in the Western
Pacific Railroad, and he and Charles Mc-
Laughlin built thirty miles of it. His
interest was sold to the Central Pacific
Company, and be was fora time a large
owner of the stock of that company.
Late in the sixties he had a* quired con
siderable wealth by his industry, shrewd
ness, force of character and his readiness
and ability to mrtnage big enterprises.
There was boldness and a spirit of enter
prise in bis nature. He was not a man of
culture, but he was a man of more than
ordinary intellectual power and native
ability. He added to this care oi his
character, reputation and physical
health. .
It was at this period of his career, about
18G7, tnat he assumed a commanding
i lace in California Republican politics.
It was through his domiaanceof the party
machine that George C. Gorham was
nominated for Governor, to be defeated
by Haight. Carr continued at the party
helm. Gorham went to Washington, and
later became secretary of the Senate.
' A. A. Sargent, then a Congressman and
a friend of Carr's. aspired to the Senator
ship, and the memorable battle over Sar
gent followed. Carr backed Sargent with
all his political resources and conducted
his fight in a masterful way. with George
C. Gorham as one of his associates. Sar
gent triumphed, and owed his election
mainly to the political leader, William B.
Carr. Added to Sargent and Gorham was
Congressman Page of Alameda to uphold
Carr's power.
It was thus that through a large por
tion of Grant's administration Carr dic
tated the apportionment of Federal patron
age in California. He never concerned
himself with local politics, and early in
the eighties he wholly retired from the
political, field and never thereafter re
entered it, often express ne a piece of wis
dom to the effect that a man was a fool to
dabble in politics. The men of his day
who survive express the estimate that he
was a master as an organizer of men.
A part of his success was due: to a
faculty of making friends and popularity
among them.
Before ne left politics he turned to Kern
County and its rich expanse of arid valley
lands. There had been an opening to set
tlement of Government lands there dur
ing Sargent's Senator.hip and the rail
road owned much of the domain he cov
eted. It was in 1872 that he began the ac
quirement of great tracts of this land,' and
he early conceived a great plan of irriga
tion and settlement.
' During \ the seventies J. B. Haggin
bought large holdings t ere also, but Carr
proceeded independently for many years.
In 1889 he associated his interests with
those of J. B. Haggin, and 1891 Carr, Hyggin
and Lloyd Tevis formed, tne Kern County
Land Company J;, and the Kern ' County
Canal and .Water Company. These inter
ests extended the i irrigation system al
ready greatly developed mainly by Carr,

Mme. Barrio', the President's Fasci
nating Wif.', Arrives Here oa
the City of Sydney.
Mme. Barrios, the wife of President
Barrios of Guatemala, arrived here yes
terday afternoon aboard the steamer City
of Sydney and is stopping at the Occi
dental. 'â  - l * \~
Purchasing Agent Schwerin of the Pa
cific Mail steamship and Surveyor Wil
liam English met the distinguished lady
out in the stream and transferred her, her
party and all their belongings, which are
said to include a wealth of jewels, to their
tug and to Lomoard-street wharf, avoid
ing ail vexatious delays.
Mme. Barrios has visited this City a
number of limes, the last being about
three years ago. When she was seen yes
terday in her apartments she looked quite
as young as before, though not bo fleshy.
She is of over average height, with a figure
that never would indicate ten years of
married life. Her hair is of the extreme
blonde type, whilo her eyebrows are
dark. J,-_ ".,-
Mme. Barrios is a native of Louisiana
and naturally speaks English fluently,
but with a pronounced Spanish accent
that is pleasant to her hearers, although
she claims it is aggravating to her. .-...*.
"It angers me to think I cannot speak
my own language without anaccent," she
declared; "but you see we speak very Ut
ile English in Guatemala. It is always
either French or Spanish; "
"It is jut a short trip I am taking this
time," sue said when asked as to the pur
pose of her visit. "I decided between two
days that I would- like to visit San Fran
cisco again, and I started. I believed my
health would be benefited, as I have been
suffering lately from nervous prostration
or something else of that kind,' to which
unfortunate womankind is subject.
"Since I left the /President, eighteen
days ago, I have again changed my mind
and it will be a surprise to him to learn
that instead of ;re main ing in this City a
month or two before going DacK home. I
will push on to New York and then to
Europe. 1 will return to Guatemala via
this .City in about lour mouths. I will
leave here with Dr. Joaquin Teta, the
Guatemalan Consul, for New York within
a week. 'â¢ * .m t __
, "I do not care to speak much about
politic?," Mme. BarriosjÂ£iniormed her in
terviewer, r "women; you - know, : ' : and *-',: I
especially, know very little about it. v.
I "A new President of Guatemala ", is ito
be elected next March, and President Bar
rios, my litis Da d, has ; declared i that', he
does not desire re-election. -
"The other : candidates are Prospero
Morales, the former 1 Minister of War;
Daniel Fuentes and. Jose . Castillo. I do
not know .which one is most popular. As
a tact, it is more difficult to tell which is
most unpopular. For : this reason every
possible overture has been made to the
President to again place himself to the
front, and it may be that, whether he wiil
or not, tne people will re-elect him." **:â¢'â .:'
Speaking of the prosperity of Guate
mala, Mme. Barrios claimed it had never
been better. . â  Â« ' <

REV.M.P. BOYNTON
HAS RESIGNED
He Has Followed the Ex
ample of Rev. J. George
Gibson.
;
The First Baptist Church Loses
an Excellent
Leader.
Friction Between the E der and
Younger Memb rs Caused the
Trouble.
Rev. Dr. M.P. Boynton of the First
Baptist Church has resigned. His resig
nation came, somewhat as a surprise to
many of his congregation, for Dr. Boyn
ton is a great favorite among his people.
Directly after the morning's service the
pastor said he had a few remarks to make
and then proceeded to read the following
letter of resignation: .
To the members of the First Baptist Church of
San Franciscoâ Dear People : On the Ist
01 next July three years of service in your
midst will be at an end. During this time I
have enjoyed my labors with you as J have
enjoyed no other labor in my life. I thank
you heartily I for all the kindness you have
shown and the co-operation you have given
me while sustaining with you the relation of
an assistant, acting and full pastor.
Of late I have come to feel that it may be for
the best good of Christ's kingdom as repre
sented by our church,' for me lo saver my rela
tions as pastor, which I. hereby do, to take
effect the Ist of August, 1897. I earnestly
hope that you will give this resignation your
attentiou at your earliest convenience and
you will pardon me if I say that I must insist
upon its acceptance, .""
May the choicest blessing of our Heavenly
Father rest upon you in all your labors, unit
ing all hearts as one in Jesus Christ, that the
world may know we are his disciples. Thank
ing you again and with a heart overflowing
with love, I am very sincerely your pastor,
p Y-- : M. P. Boynton.
This was Dr. Boynton's first pastorate
after graduating from the seminary. For
eight months he was assistant paster, ten
months acting pastor, and tor one year
and a half full pastor. .-â â¢-*'
When seen yesterday afternoon he had
nothing to say, save that the First Church
was composed of "a lovely congregation,
who bad all been extremely kind" to him.
There is a slight friction between the
younger and older members of the church,
and when Dr. Boynton was elected pastor
it was against the wishes of the older
members, who wanted Dr. Cameron of
Boston for this place, but the majority
ruled, and so the young people had their
way. ' : .*>.
Ever since there has been a certain
amount of dissatisfaction in the church
and while the older folks could not hnd a
single haw in Dr. Boynton, who has cer
tainly been a most exemplary pastor in
every way, they have evidently felt ag
grieved in having been passed over. But
the young pastor has resigned and the
fact remains there is more of mourning
than of rejoicing over his resignation.
LOOKING TOE STAES.
Gustav Walter Hat Left on His An-
nual Trip to Europe.
Gustav Walter, the director-general of
the Orpheum circuit, left yesterday after
noon for Europe, where he is going for the
purpose of arranging booking agencies in
London, Paris, Berlin and Vienna, the
great vaudeville centers of Europe. .
On his journey East be will visit the
agencies in Chicago and New York, and
on the 27th he will sail for Europe on the
Furst Bismarck. ;:':;:'-
He will be absent three or four months.
It is the intention of tbe Orpheumiman
agement to open a house in Portland, Ore
gon, and there is a probability that more
theaters will be added to the circuit in the
future. . "V- y<, â¢',
High-salaried artists who would hesitate
about accepting an engagement at such a
great distance will now be assured of
longer engagements, and the San Fran
cisco public will, therefore, be benefited.
A DOUBLE OELEBEATION.
St. Paul's Lutheran Church Observes
Two Anniversaries.
A double anniversary took place at St.
Paul's Lutheran Church yesterday morn
ing â the thirtieth anniversary of the
founding of St. Paul's in this City, and
the fiftieth of the Synod of Missouri. The
church was beautifully decorated with
flowers, bunting and evergreens.
At 9 o'clock 500 children belonging to
the Sunday-school assembled in the
schoolrooms and marched in a procession
through the church. When the children
were seated Pastor Buehler addressed
them. At 10:30 the actual services began.
After an organ prelude and singing by
the congregation, Mr. Buehler preached a
sermon, and the Sunday services were
over. To-day the Ladies' Aid Society will
hold socials, both afternoon and evening.
*Â« Cupid " Danforth Hurt.
F. R. Danforth, the Deputy County Clerk
who has acquired fame as "Cupid" Danforth
at the marriage license counter, met with a
serious accident yesterday. He was riding
homeward on a Clay-street cur â  and :as- it
swung around the curve into Larkin street he
was thrown from 'he car, his head striking on
a paving stone. He was knock' d insensible
and his scalp was deeply lacerated, the wound
bleeding freely. Dr. C. V. Cross of Filln ore
and California streets stitched up the wound.
The injury is not likely to prove serious.
