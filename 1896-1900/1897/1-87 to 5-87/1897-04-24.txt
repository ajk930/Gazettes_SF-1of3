THE TABLES
IN THESSALY
Troops of the Sultan Said
to Be Destitute and
Demoralized.
KING GEORGE'S FORCES NOW
HOLD THEIR OWN.
Decided Check of the Onward March of the
Invading Moslem Hordes Followed by
a General Changing of Turkish
Commanders.
That something of importance has occurred on the Thessalian
frontier to check the advance of the Moslems upon Larissa is noted by
the recall of Edhem Pasha, commander-in-chief ,of the Turkish forces.
Osman Pasha has been ordered to succeed Edhem. Changes are also
reported among Turkish generals in Epirus.
Now the general political situation promises to attract more atten
tion than the actual military operations. Emperor William's recent
visit to Vienna is followed by a willingness on the part of Francis
Joseph to drop Italy from the triple alliance, if Russia is substituted.
Official reports relate the gallant defense of the bridge over the
river Arta by the Greek troops, who on the 20th inst. defeated the !
attacking Turkish forces, killed their commander and scattered them
over the plain beyond the river. Greeks are also holding their own in
Thessaly.
From Constantinople comes the news that the Turkish fleet has
returned there. The vessels were unseaworthy and the commanders â 
were afraid to take any chances. Quite different are the reports con- i
cerning the Greek Western squadron. These modern warships are j
bombarding towns along the western Albanian coast, and soon a bom- i
bardment of Salonica is expected.
THEIR ADVANCE CHECKED.
Turks Have Not Yet Reached Lar-
Issa and May Not Arrive

fCopyrljrbted 1897, By the New York Sun.]
LONDON, Esq., April 23.â The advance
of the Turks on Larissa has undoubtedly
been partially checked, but no news has
been received here which justifies or ex
plains the lecall of Â£<lhem Pasha, the
Turkish commander-in-cbief. The first
report that Osman Pasha had superseded
Edhem is not believed in London, for the
latter's march into Thessaly was regarded

at a triumphal one. Later accounts of J
tfaa gloomy feeling id Constantinople nave
created a belief that the Turks have suf
fered reverses which hay* not been re
ported to the outstde world.
The general political situation is begin
ning to attract more attention than tbe
military operations. The activity of Em
! peror William and the efforts of Bulgaria
'â  to put pressure on the Sultan are creatine
' uneasiness, but no serious fear is enter
tained yet that the war will become gen

I such trifles as Salisbury remaining at the

Riviera and the steadiness of the markets.
On the other band there are some dis
turbing symptoms. It is clear ibe recent
visit of Emperor William to Vienna is of
the highest significance. It is practically
admitted that be incited the Sultan to
war, and the question now is whether he
secretly desires it to spread. Bulgaria did
not threaten the Sultan until Ferdinand,
the ruler of that country, consulted Wil
liam, and it is now presumed the latter is
seeking to bring Austria and Russia into
accord.
It is reported in Vienna that Francis
Joseph is willing to drop Italy from the
Triple Alliance if Russia is substituted.
THE FIGHT IN MILOUNA PASS.
The latest Paris advices indicate that
France is uecotning so restive on accoui.t
of tbaÂ«e maneuvers that the Cabinet
would be in great danger if the Chamber
of Deputies were in session. It will proba
bly be found that Salisbury will be ready
to take full advantage of the latter situa
tion the moment the relations of Franc?
and Russia become strained. In the
meantime the prospect is diminishing of
a quick sweeping victory by the Turks
over the Greeks.
The Turkish navy has utterly collapsed
as was expected it would do. Every day
the Greek* can hold the enemy in check
in Thessaly their chance of gaining their
object increases. Still it is impossible to
judge accurately of the situation on the
frontier, but the dispatches from both
sides indicate that the Greek fortures have
improved distinctly.
HOLDING THEIR OWN.
Advices From Athens Show That
the Greeks Have Dealt Severe
Blows to the Turks.
LONDON, Eire., April 23.â A dispatch
to tne Cbroniclo from Athens states that
the Greeks are holding iheir own in Thes
saly. The Turks do not possess any
Greek territory. Nothing can prevent
the victorious Greek fleet from rencning
Balonicaand Smyrna. Everything is go
ing well financially. Subscriptions from
Greeks abroad are pouring in and the
value of paper money has risen materially.
The dispatch adds the wounded troops
from Gritzovali declare when the Greeks
began to retreat from that place at night
fall and several of their wounded were
left behind the Turks shut these in a
small church, which they then set afire.
All were burned to death.
Crown Princs Constantino telegraphed
this evening:
"The Turks are quiet to-day owing to
our success- yesterday. We have destroyed
the Turkish battery at Ligaria. The
Turks have retired from Nezeros and
Rapsani. I was in the firat line of fire
yesterday."
A dispatch to the Times from Kalam
baka dated to-day says: "There was fight
ing at midday yesterday at Ssproklisaia,
westward of here, where the Greeks on
Tuesday burned the Turkish blockhouse.
The TurJts afterward made rifle pits. The
engagement resulted in a Greek victory.
The Turkish loss must have been consid
erable, nine shells having bum in the
rifle pits and several over them."
The Daily News has a dispatch from
Salon ica dated yesterday saying it is
reported the Turkish forces have sustained
severe reverses and have been repulsed all
along the line. Their losses are said to
have been heavy.
Radically contradictory dispatches to
the Times dated Milouna this morning
aay the Turks continued yesterday and to
day to advance through the plain of
Larissa. The Greeks are avoiding a
general engagement and are gradually
retiring. Edhem Pasha, the correspond
ent declared, was pursuing a cautious
policy.
The Athens correspondent of the Man
chester Guardian oars King George will
appeal soon to the Greeks throughout the
world to assist the country with men and
' money. j
The Chronicle has started a fund for tbe
relief of the Greek wounded. A commit
tee has been formed to administer the
fund which includes Lady Dilke, Lady
Henry Somerset, Mrs. Gladstone, Mrs.
Asquithand Mrs. Labouehere.
IN DESPERATE STRAITS.
The Army In Thessaly Need Sup
plies, and Forces In Epirus
Panic Stricken.
ATHENS, Greece, April 23.â A decree
was issued by the King to-night summon
ing the two classes of the National Guard
for active service.
Late dispatches from Larissa say the
Turks have burned the villages of Karayo
land of Moralaria and part of Igaria, in
cluding churches.
Dispatches from Epirus say the Turks
in that province are panic stricken and,
instead of remaining to defend their posi
tions, flee in terror as the Greeks ap
proach. Many cannon and quantities of
ammunition and an abundance of booty
are said to have fallen into the hands of
the invaders. It is learned the position of
the army oi Edhem Pasha is desperate.
Supplies of all kinds are needed.
Appeals for re-enforcements are due to
serious losses the Turks sustained. At
Reveni and Boughazi whole battalions of
Turkish troops were decimated.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, April 23.
Edbem Pasha has telegraphed from the
front that the Greeks are making only a
feeble defense to Larissa. He says the
Turks are advancing very cautiously, be
lieving the Greeks have planted dynamite
mines in the outskirts of the city.
OSMAN IN COMMAND.
By Palacs Intrigue Edhem Pasha,
the Leader of the Turkish
Forces. Is Recalled.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Tttrket, April
23. â Osman Pasha has been aisigned to
command the Turkish troops before La
ritsa. Edhem Pasha, Commander-in
chief of the Turkisii forces, with head
quarters at Elassona, haa been recalled.
It ia said thai Eddin Pasha has also been
appointed to command the Turcisu troops
at Janina, in Epirus, replacing Ahmed
Hafiz Pasha. The palace intriguers are
again on the move and it is possible they
may have caused the recall of Edhem
Pasha, although it seems clearly suicidal
to stop in the development of his plan of
campaign.
Osman Pasha left Constantinople for the
front to-night. The Sultan has conferred
the fullest power* upon Osman and as
sured him he will not be fettered by pal
ace intriguers. Edbem Pasha has been
appointed adjutant-general to the Sultan.
LONDON, Eng., April 23.â A dispatch
to the Times from Constantinople states
that Osman Pasha will have the supreme
command of ail the Turkish forces.
El hero Pasha will remain commander of
the Army of the East. It is said Eddin
Pasha will command the Army of the
West. _
AT THE ARTA BRIDGE.
Valor of the Creeks, Who Routed
the Turks and Pursued Them
Beyond the River.
ATHENS, Grekck, April 23.â Official re
port! of the defense made April 20 by the
Greeks on tlie bridge over the river Ana,
which divides Greece from Turkey, show
i they conducted themselves with tbe (
I greatest valor. Three times the enemy
advanced to the bridge, only to meet a
murderous lira. The Turks did not get
farther than the center of the bridge, at
which powit their commander was shot
dead.
In the afternoon the Turks made an
other assault, but the Greeks were then
sheltered la the trenches ana repulsed
them. The Greeks crossed the river near
Koniena, three miles from its mouth,
where the current is rapid and the water
deep. They nailed planks across barrels
and threw them overboard, forming an
excellent bridge. Arriving on the other
side, they found tLe Turks some distance
from the river entrenched upon the plain.
The Greeks shelled the Turks out. The
Turks retreated and formed in several j
other positions, but were invariably dis
lodged.
Stories of Mussulman atrocities are cur
reni in Arta. One eye-witnebs says a j
number of Christian women, captives of \
the Turks, were marched in front of the!
Turkish lines in the hope their country
men would not tire.
NOT FIT FOR SERVICE.
Return of the Turkish Fleet Ba
cause the Captains Ware Afraid
to Go to Sea.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, April 23.
The captains of the vessels comprising
the Turkish fleet in the Dardanelles have
presented to the Navy Department a rouud
robin declaring that they are convinced of
the uu fitness of ail the ships for active
service, and in consequence the vessels
were ordered to return to Constantinople
singly in order that it might not attract
public attention. This order has been
carried out.
BOMBARDING TOWNS.
Cruise of the Creek Squadron Along
the Albanian Coast on the
Way to Salonlca.
ATHENS, Greece, April 23.â The Greek
Western squadron, consisting of a cruiser
and three gunboats, left Corfu, bound
northward, with orders to bombard the
Albanian coast towns as far as Aolona,
the principal port on the west coast of
Albania, having 6000 inhabitants.
The fleet has already bombarded the
town of Agioi Saranta. AH the buildings
were destroyed, excepting the Austrian
Agency.
A (f.ispatch from the commander of a
Greek ironclad, in the squadron in the
Gulf of Salonica, says the warships have
captured the town of Katerina. The
Greeks destroyed large quantities of sup
plies destined for Elassona, Upon re
turning to Flatomona the squadron
shelled the town of Litokharion. The
Turks detached a force of 8000 to prevent
the Greeks from landing. The squadron
also captured three Turkish vessels laden
with wheat.
LONDON, Eng., April 23.â The Daily
News correspondent in Salouica says il is
reported the Greek squadron is outside in
the k vi lf, but i: cannot be authenticated.
It is believed, however, the Greek Eastern
tquadron is under orders to attack Sa
lonica.
ONLY A RELIGIOUS WAR.
Already Egypt Is Contributing, and
the Mecca Appeals to India
to Aid the Sultan.
LONDON, Ekg., April 23.â The Con
stantinople correspondent of the Speaker,
who is high in authority on the subject.
and cognizant of the inside workings at
embassies, writing on April 19, says:
"If there i> war to-day in Thessaly it is
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
. simply because the concert of Europe have
taken sides with Turkey and E.ven the
Sultan to understand be can hare as free
a hand in Greece as Armenia. The Sultan
was not much inclined to t:ike chances of
war, and it is believed bere lha: Germany
influenced him to take the final steo.
\ Other powers advised peace, bin assured
i him Europe would not intervene in aid of
Greece. Even now the war might be
stopped, but no power honestly wishes it
"Salisbury preferred to let things drift,
with ihevaguo idea that war would be
better than nothing and something would
come which would end the long and
wearisome period of fruitless negotia
tions. He hoped the Turns might pos
sibly be beaten and the Sultan be beaten
into submission, and that Â«yon if Victori
ous he would come out of the war in a
condition of helpless bankruptcy, too
weak to resist the powers.
"The Turkish armies ought to be in
Athens within a month. For the Turks
this is strictly a religious war. They are
full of fanaticism and drunk with tn*
blood of Armenians. The idea that the
Sultan, even if he should be victorious,
will come out of the war rather than abdi
cate comes from a mistaken view of his
character and policy. It does not follow
from his fear of assassination and appar
ent vacillation in dealing witu Embassa
dors that he is a weak man without a
fixed policy. On the contrary, he it a
very strong man, with the indomitable
purpose to restore the power and glory of
the Caliphat. The success of this war
will mat â¢ him more defiant than ever.
It will arouse the courage and fanaticism
of Moslems throughout the world. Al
ready Egypt is contributing for the war
against the infidel, and the Mecca has ap
pealed to India to come to the Sultan's
aid."
REED REFUSES.
The Speaker Will Not Let Maglur*
Present Resolutions Expressing
Sympathy for Greece.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 23.-
Speaker Reed refused to-day to permit
the resolutions presented by Representa
tive Maguire, extending sympathy to the
Greeks, to come before the House. The
Californian, to secure immediate action,
asked Reed to recognize him for unani
mous consent to take up the resolutions.
"1 cannot assume the responsibility of
permittins these resolutions to come up,"
replied Reed. "They meddle in affairs
that do not belong to us. This country
got one severe slap from Bismarck tor
meddling, and I do not propose to lay it
open to a second."
Maguire was hnally compelled to intro
duce the resolutions in the regular way,
which means the shelving of them until
the Committee on Foreign Affairs is ap
pointed.
Are thfl Powers Allies?
LONDON, Eng., Apxil 23.â A dispatch
from Canea says a Greek officer to-day
brought a dispatch from Colonel Vatsos,
commander of the Greek army occupying
the island, addressed to the admirals of
the foreign fleets inquiring whether the
Dowers were allies of Turkey. Vassos add
ed that he had received orders to attack
the Ottoman troors in the island. What
reply the admirals made is not known.
Wou'd Not Stop a Yankee.
LONDON, Eng., April 23.â Gladstone,
in conversation with a cal.er yesterday on
the Eastern situation, said he hoped some
Yankee skipper would run a cargo into â¢
Cretan port. lie imagined, he said, the
blockading squadron in Cretan waters
would not dare to atop him.2
SPEAKER REED'S
RULINGS ALL GO
Bland Appeals in Vain,
for Members Sustain
the Chair.
Senate Amendments on the
Indian Appropriation Bill
Not Approved.
Virtually Adjourned for Ten Days,
Pending: a Consideration of
the Tariff.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 23.â Bland,
with his Pacific railroad resolution, was
a^ain to-day ths means of uniting all op
position in the House to the ruiins by the
Speaker. The scene was in a degree a re
petition of those violent controversies
which raged in the Fif y-rirst and Fifty
second Congresses. The row began im
mediately after the prayer of the cnap
lain and the reading or the journal, when
Bland got the floor to offer a resolution
relating to the Union Pacific Railroad.
Dingley suggested it was not a matter
of privilege; that under the guiso of a
lesolution of inquiry Bland was calling
for information on questions of law from
the Attorney-General.
To a question of the Speaker Bland said
he reeardea the motion as privileged for
the reason that there were no committees
to which it could go, wich would be the
ordinary course. The Speaker overruled
the point. Bland appealed and wanted a
debate, but Dingley objected and moved
to lay tbe appeal on the table. A de
sultory debate c sued, in which Bland,
Bailey and Dingley participated.
The SpeaKer took a band, statins that
the resolution, by the statements of Bland
and Baiiey, was more than a resolution
of inquiry, hence it had loot any privi
leged character it may hava had.
Bartholdi (R.) of M ssouri demanded a
vote on Duigley's motion to iay the ap
peal on the table. This brought Bailey
and Bland and Richardson of Tennessee
to their feet in opposition. Richardson
asked ihe Speaker if he held, when Bland
appealed from the decision of the chair
and sought the floor for the purpose of
discussing that appeal, that any member
might move to lay the appeal on the
table.
"The chair has so ruled," Baid Reed.
He said the appeal from the chair's de
cision could be discussed by a vote of the
House defeating a motion to Jay the ap
l eal on tne table. "If the House does
not wish to bear debate it need not. Tbe
House is not at the mercy of individual
members."
Bland and Richardson attempted to
proceed, but the Speaker peremptorily
cut them off, saying he must decdne to
entertain further debate. The question
was then put, Richardson shouting, "It
was never done in this House before."
Dingley's motion to lay the appeal oa the
table was agreed to on a division of tue
Houseâ 97 to 83.
The Democrats demanded the ayes and
noes ana secured a rollcall. Tne pairs
cut down the record of the vote to 78 ayes
and 75 noes, 22 members being recorded
''present." So the appeal was tabled.
A message was received from the Senate
announcing the passage of the bank
ruptcy biiL
Oa motion of Robinson (D.) of Indiana
Bland, the present Democratic repreÂ«ent
ative of the longest service in the House,
was added to the committee to attend the
funeral of Holcan.
At the suggestion of Dingley, who ex
plained tnat the Senate had made the
same arrangement, it was agreed tbat the
House adjourn at the close of to-day's
session until Monday, then -cntil Thurs
day and again to Monday, May 3, no busi
ness to ba transacted, practically a ten
day adjonrnmant.
A reso.ution offered by Dalzell of Penn
sylvania was adopted, authorizing the
Speaker to appoint a committee of twenty
five members, himself at the head, to rep
resent the House at the Grant monument
services.
The House then went into committee
of the whole and resnmed consideration
of the Senate amendments to the Indian
appropriation bill. The amendment pro
viding for the opening of the ITncom
pahgre Reservation in Utah and limiting
to five acres any claim taken by one per
son upon gilsonite or asphalt deposits was
discussed. Shafroth of Colorado related
Dis experience in laying a pavement in
Denver oi the material from this deposit.
It proved to be of no value ir>r paving
and he believed the value of the deposits
had been greatly exaggerated.
Dingley urged the riou-e to adopt tne
policy of leasing lands on a royalty, the
deposits estimated to be 23,000,000 tons,
which should yield the Government a
revenue of nearly $40,000,000. The Senate
amendment was non-concirred in, the
committee recommending the House to
instruct the conferees to insist upon the
proposition to lease the lands.
A lively controversy ensued over the
Senate amendment relating to the lease of
oil lands in ;hÂ» Seneca reservation. It
was finally agreed to non-concur.
Tne Mil was then reported to the House,
only one of the important amendments
having been adopted. The action of the
committee of the whole wa.< approved and
the bill was sent to conference on the
amendments disagreed to. The conference
committee was uninstructed about the
gilsonite amendment.
The Speaker announced the committee
to attend the Grant monument dedica
tion. He appointed C. W. Stone of Penn
sylvania Speaker pro tern. next week. The
House then adjourned.
HAWAIIAN MlXlSZiilt SEWAJjL.
Bis Appointment Vi'ived With favor by
the Annexationists.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 23.â The
Star says: The appointment o! Harold
M. Sewall of Maine to be Minister to
Hawaii is regarded as having an impor
tant bearing on the question of annexa
tion. While Mr. Sewail, who is at
present in Washington, will not discuss
the subject at ibit time, it is well under
stood that be is in sympathy with the
annexationists. Mr. Sewall baa talked
over the whole qcestion with the Secre
tary of State and thoroughly understands
the attitude of the administration toward
Hawaii. The appointment, being made
at thia time, is regarded as an indication
that the Hawaiian question is at present
under serious consideration, and the
selection of Mr. Sewall teems indicative
of the administration's policy, which will
be a reversal 01 the blundering policy of
Mr. Cleveland.
Mr. .Sewall is quiie familiar with the
situation of the Pacific Wanda, lie was
Consul at Apia. Samoa, and spent some
lime at Honolulu in 1887, stopping there
on his way to Apia at tbe request of
A a sistait Secretary of State Porter. Dur
ing the pait ten voars he has spent con
siderable time in Hawaii, and has made a
study of the people and their condition 15 ,
both under tne monarchy and since the
establishment of the Republic. His ex
tensive and influential acquaintance there
will serve him well in his rresent mission.
OFFICIAL PRtCLDENCE.
Point Raised by Sir Jul an Pauncefote /s
Sustainedâ A Back S*at tor the
Vies- President.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 23.â 1t was
officially announced to-day that the fric
tion over the question of diplomatic and
Vice- Presidential precedence has been
amicabiy adjusted on tiie lines indicated
in The Call to-day. Another phase of
tbe issue has also been settled satisfac
torily. This concerned the method of
transporting the diplomatic corps from
Washington to New York. At first it was
intended that the President, tbÂ« Cabinet
and four Embacsadors should travel on
one train, and the Vice-President, foreign
Ministers and other members of the diplo
matic corps on another. The new arrange
ment ia tbat the entire diplomatic corps
shall make the journey with th* Presi
dent. This separation of tlie President
and Vice-President Is not arranged as a
concession to official etiquette, but roerelv
aa a precautionary measure, shoald acci
dent befail either train, thnt both Presi
dent and Vice-President will not be im
periled at the same time.
It was learned to-day that Bayard, at
the instance of ex-Secretary Olney, had
investigated the practice of foreign courts
wiih regard to otlioial proced nee. Bayard
reported that Embassaaors invariably rank
next to royalty at functions. Bayard
explained that he had been given pre
cedence over Salisbury and the entire
British Cabinet. This issue has always
been evaded here. The Vice-President has
never attended diplomatic dinners at the
WhitÂ© Honse, and Embassadors have not
been invited to break bread with ihe Presi
dent when the Vice-President vaspre-tent.
At these dinners tne Secretary of State
comes behind the Embassadors and ahead
of the Ministersâ a sort of a diplomatic
sandwich.
INTERESTS THE COAST.
Da Young Does Not Want the Belgian
Mission â Forecast Station for Los
Ang?fes â Pensions.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 23.â The
Call prediction that If. H. de Young was
doomed to disappointment in his ambition
to be Minister to Belg ura was confirmed
to-day when the President nominated
Bellamy Storer of Cincinnati, Ohio. Mr.
Storer is an ex- Congressman, a wealthy
gentleman and in every way quaified for
the mission. It is said that Mr. de Young
will now try ana go to Rus3ia. Mr. de
Young may ieceive some recognition, but
he must not aspire to a foreign mission ot
first or second class.
Through the influence of Senator Per
kins a weather forecast station will soon

CBKDIT liCR lit: TRIES.
The Aeu> Congressman 3far;rs an Effort
for the DlgQtr Indiana.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 23.-The
passage through the House of the Senate
amendment appropriating $3090 for the
benefit of the Digger Indian reservation
in Amador County is due to Congressman
De Vries. Senator Perkins had secured
its insertion in the Senate bill, but the
House Committee on Indian Affairs was
opposed to it and Chairman Snerman of
that committee movnd the non-concur
rence of the House.
Immediately Congressman De Vries
moved a substitute >o concur and ad
dressed tne House at length in support of
his substitute. He pointed out that
5-0,000 had already been appropriated and
exoended for this purpose and that with
out this $3900 the benefits of tne former
appropriation would ba lost; that the
Diggers were a dependent tribe and as
such were especially meritorious objects
of Governmental bounty, and supported
his contention by a letter of recommend
ation from the actinz Secretary oi Indian
Affairs. The substitute of Mr. De Vries
was then adopted.
A.H3IOR-PIBHCIAG rRuJECTIL, ts
Highly bucctuful Trttt by Experts of
the Ordnance department.
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 23.-Ord
nance experts held an important test at
the Indian Head naval station to-day, at
which it was proved that the new cap de
vice fixed to the point of armor-piercing
projectiles will vastly increase their pene
trating powers and render a shot from a
six-inch rifle almost as effective against
steel plates as those from a gujof an inch
higher caliber. At the test to-day a six
inch shot passed through a plate whicu
under old conditions would not have been
pierced with an eigbi-inch shot. Under
a velocity of 1950 feet a second the six
inch shell went clean through fcix-inch
steel without scratching the shell and
leaving a clean-cut hole in the plate. The
ten insures the acceptance of a large lot
of projectiles.

Will I'robnbhf Be Rr ported to the Senate
Â»art Thunday.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 23.-Tho
present arrangement of the Republican
members of the Finance Committee is to
report the tariff bill to the Senate on
Thursday. Whether the measure will b*
reported to the full committee is uncer
tain, but it Is likely that it will be infor
mally presented and a vote taken on the
question of reporting it to the Senate
without allowing an examination of the
bill. This would prevent any endeavor to
amend or cause delay. Judging trom this
decision of tue Republican sub-committee
it is probable that Jones of Nevada, who
holds the balance oi power in the Finance
Committee, has given assurance that he
will vote to report the bill.
TO BE ASSISTANT PREMIER.
j Judge T)ay Will Aot Go at Commit
Â«ioHÂ«r to Cuba.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 23.â Judge
William Day of Canton win on Monday be
appointed Assistant Secretary of State.
The President decided it would be not
wise to appoint his own choice, ex-Repre
sentative Bellamy Storer of Cincinnati, in
view of the determination of Foraker to
oppose the confirmation. It is under
stood that Storer himself relieved the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 24, 1897.
IMPATIENT FOR
BETTER TIMES
People Who Cannot
Wait for the Tide
of Prosperity.
Dingley Explains the Business
Stagnation of the
Country.
Enormous Importations While the
Tariff Bill Is Still Under
Dscussion.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April
bers of Congress are receiving letters from
various parts of the country indicating
impatience because the prosperity which
was promised as a result of the election
of a Republican Congress and President
has not already made itself apparent.
The Call correspondent had a talk with
Mr. Dingley to-nighÂ«, who said:
"I do not think it possible that any con
siderable number of the people of the
United State* have any such thought. Of
course the enemy is doing what it can to
foster that idea, but it ia so entirely un
reasonable that I cannot believe that any
body who gives the matter a moment's
thought can suppose it justifiable.
"What has been done? To be sure the
people deposited their ballots in favor of
the Repui lican party and its protective
theory in November; the President whom
they elected has been inaugurated and
one branch ol Congress has passed the
tariS bi!l. But that cannot possibly have
any effect in the way of improving the
situation, so far as relates to the manu
facturins industries of the country or the
other industries which would be affected
by tneir improvement."
"Feather the reverse, would it not?"
asked The Call correspondent.
"Momentarily, ye?. The fact that a new
tariff measure is pending and tbat it pro
poses to increase the ratps of duty on
many articles has the effect of tempo
rarily unsettling the business operations
of the manufacturers. Prices are baseu,
of course, to a certain extent upon those
named by foreign manufacturers who in
vade the market, and our own manufac
turers are uncertain as to what they will
themselves have to pay for such raw ma
terial as they will import for use in their
manufacturing after the new law goes
into effect. In that particular, at least,
the tendency of a new tariff law unsettles
the business operations of the manufac
turers in thi.Â« country and makes it. im
possible for them to make contracts or
push their business. The greatest injury
to their business, however, lies in the fact
that such enormous quantities of foreign
goods are being imported and forced upon
the market.
"Of course I do not mean that the moral
effect of the election which insured the
stability of our currency and assured the
people that they are to have the protec
tion which once gave them prosperity,
fa. led to have an immediate effect in
seme degree. I think it is generally con
ceded that business did improve and has
improved since this assurance was given ;
but it is not reasonable to suppose tnat
the improvement resulting from increased
manufactures and the consequentfy in
creased business for those affected by
their activity can be felt before the bill be
comes a law, or even immediately after
ward. Improvement in business always
comes slowly. A business depression
may occur in a day, but improvement
never comes suddenly. Certainly it can
not be expected that it wiil be so in this
case when it is remembered that practi
cally a year's stock of goods will have
been -brought into the country from
abroad before the tariff bill become, a
law."
"A year's stock, Mr. Dingley?"
"In many cases, at least, yes. That
may seem like a broad assertion, but very
few people realize, I think, the enormous
quantity of goods now being brought in
and which have come in in the past few
months. The customs receipts upon duti
able goods alone have doubled, and if you
will examine the reports of importations
of non-dutiab.e goods you will find that
they have increased enormously. I ob
serve by a paragraph in a recent number
of a Boston paper that fourteen vessels
iaden with wool arriveti in that city in
one day last week. When you remember
that the bili has yet to be considered by
the full Senate committee, by the Senate,
wbere there is unlimited debate, and by
a conference committee, it iÂ« apparent
that weeks and probably months must
vet elapse before it gets upon the statute
books and into operation. I hope, how
ever, to see it a law by July 1. During all
this meantime I suppose the flood of for
ei n importations wili continue to a
greater or less extent, as many of the im>
porters had ordered goods prior to April
1, and will continue 10 bring them in.
This is especially trne nith reference to
wool, which is imported in great quanti
ties at this season of the year.
"These facts," continued Mr. Dingley in
conclusion, "ought to show the people
who slop to consider them the impossi
biiiiy of business improvement so far as re
lates to increased activity in manufactur
ing and its reflex influences upon other
lines of business until the new measure is
not only upon the statute-books, but; has
bad time to make itsell felt and time li
given for the abt-orption of the enormous
quantity of foreign goods now being forced
upon the market. I believe the people
will see prosperity when the bill has had
time to produce its natural effect, but it is
not reasonable to assume that it could ac
complish these results in advance of its
existence as a law, or even in the first few
weeks or months of its operation."

â Republican* Agree to the Tertnt of the
< < -nthin-d Opposition.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 23. -The
Republican Senators to-day adopted in
caucus the agreement reached by their
steering committee with the opposition
for filing the vacancies now existing in
the committees. It Is practically the plan
presented by the Democratic-Populist-Sil
ver Republican combination, the mem
bers of which nre elated at forcing the Re
publicans to accept their terms. On the
other hand the Republicans are not dis
posed to view the plan with disfavor, for
they argue that the opposition, having
forty-seven votes to their forty-two, could
tate the committees entirely.
By the agreement Republicans will sit
at the heads of lorty committees, or two
more than thf-y now have, but will not,
owing to the defection of Silver Republi
cans since the last arrangement of the
committees, control a majority of the
committees on a vote. The vacancies are
to be tilled by members of the same party
as ti:e former occupants. The only ad
vantage, in addition to the gain of tbe
two chairmanships, is the increase of one
Republican in the Committee on Post
offices, wnich will give them control of
that committee independently of Senator
Butler.
The Republicans also took steps to se
cure a division of the patronage of the
Senate by appointing McMillin, Lodge
and Spooner a committee to confer with
the Democrats.
COMMUTE* VACANCIES.
â  â  ' â  I
Senator* Trying to Get Together and '
Settle the Matter.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 23.â
executive session of the Senate Thursday
lasted an hour and a half. It was de'
voted almost entirely to a discussion of
the question of filling committee vacan
cies.
Allen followed up his resolution, previ
ously offered in open session, to suspend
all business until vacancies are filled, by
proposing a- conference of all panics on
the subject. As this was unfavorably re
coived ue gave notice that he would press
the resolution to a vote, if possible, next
Monday.
The Democrats again insisted on hold
ing up nominations of postmasters. As
all these number upward of 100, the pres
sure therefore may have had something
to do with the revival of interest amoug
Republicans in the agreement reached by
their steering committee w.th the Demo
crats in the matter of rilling vacancies,
and upon which no action was taÃen by
the Republican caucus last week. Notices'
were sent out to-day lor another caucus
to-morrow, when it is thought an agree
ment will be reached.

THE BEGINNING
OF THEIR END
What an Agreement
Means to Five Civil
ized Tribes.
After Much Negotiations an
Understanding Is Finally
Reached.
Treaty Entered Into by the Dawes
Commission With the Choctaws
and Chlckasaws.
ATOKA, I. T., April 23 âTo-day marked
the beginning of the end of five civilized
tribes in Indian Territory. The Dawes
commission, after four weeus of laborious
negotiation, reached an agreement with
the commission from the Choctaw and
Chickasaw nations. The ireaty was care
fully read in executive session and signed
by the Dawes commission and the Indian
chiefs and commissioners.
Tlie treaty provides that all lands within
Indian Territory belonging to the Choctaw
and Cbickasaw Indiana shall be allotted
to the member.', of said tril.es ao as to give
each member (except the Choctaw freed
men) an equal share, considering charac
ter and fertility of soil, location and
value. All lands set apart for townsites
and public buildings are to be reserved
and exempted from division. All coal and
asphalt deposits are reserved for the sole
use of members of the tribes, exclusive of
freedmen.
Corporations or individuals desiring to
open coal or asphalt mines shall first pay
to the allottee or owner of the land the
value ol the use of the necessary surface
and damage to adjacent lands and im
provements, the damage to be ascertained
under the supervision of the Secretary of
the Interior. The Choctaw freedmen are
to receive forty acres of land each, to be
deducted from the Choctaw Nation prior
to Ihe allotment. In the appraisement of
lands the Choctaws and Chickasaws shall
each have a representative to co-operate
with the commissioner of the five tribes
or any one making the appraisement
under the direction of the Secretary of
the Interior. Each member may select
an allotment from the land he now oc
cupies. All the lands allotted are to be
non-taxable while the title remains with
the allottee, but not to exceed twenty-one
7ears from the date of patent.
Such allottee is required to select 160
acres from his allotment, for which he
shall have a separate patcni and which
shall be inalienable for twenty-one year.*.
The remainder of the allotment may be
disposed of by the allottee, a fourth in one
year, a iourth in three years, and the bal
ance to be determined by respective acts
of Congress.
All the coal and asphalt lands shall be
the property of the two nations. The coal
royalty is to be 15 cents a ton, to ba paid
into the treasury of the United States. A
partial jurisdiction over the Indians is
conferred upon the United States court.
The present form of governmant is to con
tinue eight years.

NEW YORK. N. V., April 23.â Charles
Fair, son o! the former millionaire Sena
tor from Nevada, was defendant in n suit
for $650 brought in a city court to-day by
John Keiiiy, a lawyer. Fair was not
present, but his lawyers fought the case
fiercely. The ground for Ihe suit was laid
when in March, 1594, Fair was sned by
"Snapper" Garrison tor $1000 an! Reilly
defended him. Reilly says that Fair told
him he uad quarreled witn the executors
of his lather 8 estate, they only allowing
him $1000 a month. This, Fair said, was
not enuugh for his support, and he cÂ«uJd
not pay Garrison's claim, but â uuid as
soon as he received his money irom the
estate. Reilly said that h* did all he was
askt-d to do, ana that the $600 sued for was
only just.
In defense Fair said that he had paid
Reihy $100 â ail his services were wortb.
He gave Reiliy $500 with which to settle
the Garrison claim, but Reilly had used
the money, compelling him to get an or
der from tue Supreme Court before he
could recover. Thus, Fair said, he nad
be n forced to pay out $1450 for the work
Reilly did â much more than the value of
Iteilly's services.
The jnry brought in a verdict awarding
Reilly $275.

Be it resolved by the Board of Commissioners
Of the Orleans L<svee District that, owing to the
present condition of the Mississippi River, all
owners and employes of steamships, steamboats
| and all other water craits are hereb> cautioned,
I under penalty of the most summary criminal
| proceedings, to proceed at the slowest possible
rate while navigating the Mississippi Kiver In
the levee district, owing to the damage to the
levee system aud damage arising from swells
created by atoresald crafts. This resolution to
be rigorously enforced.
Otto Thoman, President.
The levee at Carrollton is safe. The un
tiring diligence of those in charge of erect
ing the bulkheads that back the levee at
Carroliton has been rewarded, and the resi
dents of that locality went calmly to their
beds last night without the fear of waking
up somewhere dowu about their offices in
the morning ruling upon the crest of a
Mississippi River wave.
The stationary condition of the Missis
sippi encouraged every one, until the en
gineers gave warning to-day that the
relief was merely temporary. The Biggs
crevesse is now rilling up theTensas basin
of Louisiana. It will take ten days to do
this, after which all the crevasse water
will return to the Mississippi. The engi
neers predict over twenty feet at New Or
leans, perhaps twenty-one â more than
three feet higher than ever before known.
They are afraid that the levees will not be
able to stand this.
Owing to the report that a secret expe
dition was afoot to cut the levees a mob
started out last night and found a man
attempting to cut the levee at Point
Courtviile. Though fired upon he escaped.
The guards at the Woodland plantation,
the site of the famous Bonnet Carre cre
vasse, routed a prowler at daybreak to-day.
He dropped, in his flight, several sticks of
dynamite and fuse. Bloodhounds were
put on his trail.

An Unequal Struggle That Will
Soon Terminate In Favor
of the Oppressed.
A RAN JO, Cuba, April 12.â General
Gomez is encamped here with 2500 men,
ISOO of whom are cavalry. For nearly a
month he has been moving around these
hills and the estates of La Reforms and
Juan Griollo in an area of twenty square
miles. One Spanish column after another
has been outwitted, but all the efforts of
Weyler to make him retire to the trocha
with a view to catching him between two
tires have failed. Several times when the
Spaniards thought they were following
Gomez, pressing him to the trocha, Gomez
fired on their rear guard. Yet all the time
the Spanish reeulars in the small area de
scribed have numbered fully 40.000. The
excuÂ«e of the Spaniards that Gomez could
escape only because his whole force was
cavalry and theirs infantry cannot be used
now, as tho Spanish columns operating
against Gomez have more than 1500 cav
alry. Gomez yesterday made the follow- ;
ing statements, which were carefully re
vised by him:
"The Spaniards accuse us of cowardice,
when there is not a single day on which
important fights do not occur in all the
six provinces into which they divide the
island. Their columns are constantly
harassed, checked and obliged to abandon
marches. It is enough to take, any day,
copies of their newspapers published in
Havana. At least twelve engagements a
day is reported by them with artillery
fire, and in many cases desperate hand-to
hand fighting in others, and an aver
age of 100 men killed. In the two
years of war 36,500 men have been
killed on both sides, according to Spanish
reports, and as we have not submitted
and won't submit, how can it be honestly
believed the Cuban army does not like
righting?
"We have routed the Spaniards in sev
eral pitched battles. Spain, after such
disastrous defeats, sent 170,000 more men
against us. She conld because she had a
population of 17,000,000 and all the facilities
of a nation which does not fear any at
tack of steamers, as a Cuban warship
would be regarded as a pirate and its crew
hantred if caught by naval officers of any
of those powerful nations which claim to
pive guarantees of justice and liberty on
earth. Seeing how things stood I changed
my plans. Without a constant and
powerful supply of arms and ammunition
from abroad the Cuban army could not be
re-enforced. I was compelled to dismiss
more than 10,000 Cubans willing to fight
for their country, but without arms.
â¢I kept, therefore, only the best-armea
men in our army and began that terrible
warfare which is exhausting the resources
of Spain and annihilatine her soldiers.
Whenever a Spanish column passes it is
haraÂ«?ed without cessation. The Span
ish soldier is hunted as a wild beast Each
shot of the Cubans is aimed at a particular
man in the Spanish lines. Their big
masses are useless against this mode of
warfare. The more there are the more we
chastise them. Fifty Cubans can in this
way make havoc among 5000 Spaniaids.
The Spanish always enter towns leaving
behind on the roads a trail of dead. Thus
they are reduced and made desperate.
When I find a good strategical position to
meet them in open battle, if they do not
receive re-enforcements of several thou
sands, they have to flee before the swift
Cuban onslaught.
"Naturally, Weyler would like me to
risk in a single battle the future of Cuba,
he at the head of 100.000, I with 10,000 or
12,000; be with the best munitions of war,
I with scarcely ten shots for each man.
No courage and no science would be
needed to defeat me under such circum
stances. The cause of Cuba would be
ruined on the day I risked such a conflict,
and Spanish tyranny would continue in
this island. We are fighting against su
perior odds, deserted by all the world, we
standing alone against a European power.
As we are resolved to die or be free, we
must be cool and brave, because salTatlon
rests on our own resources only.
"The Spr.nish army in Cuba is the most
powerful European army whicn ever
fought on American soil, but even if we
cannot destroy it in one day we will
eventually. That end is near. Spain,
bleeding and penniless, cannot keep up
the war a year more. She has no re
sources and we are finally resolved to stay
In the field to tbe bitter end. Spain lies
to the foreign bankers from whom she
asks money, lies to the American Govern
ment to prevent the recognition of the
Cuban republic. We do not lie and do
not need to. Convinced that our fate de
pends upon our own efforts we let the
lects sneak for us, and the facts are that
in two years Spain has >had an armr of
212,000 airainst us and spent more than
$200,000,000; and, though Weyler de
scribes me defeated, I am still here as
hopeful as ever."

The Angelenos' Guests View a Mag

Water at Night.
LOS ANGELES, Cai,., April 23.âCer
tainly the projectors of La Fiesta de Los
Angeles are deserving of a few bouquets j
themselves, amid the prodieal display of
these days. Beautiful and successful aa
have been the festiyals of the past, the
display of this year is as distinctly supe
rior to them as was that of last year over
the inexperienced attempt with which the
annual holiday was first inaugurated.
The spectacle at the tribunes this after
noon was worth crossing the continent to
see. Imagine a bank cf humanityâ 2o,ooo
people â lined up on rising tiers of seats In
the form of an oval, with thousands of
flags and pennants flying above the upper
tier. At the iuwer or closed end of the
oval is the Queens throne, higher than
the rest, dressed in rich colors and pro
tected by a wide-spreading yellow pavil
ion, the royal party, in its bright and rich
costumes, occupying all the wide space
there reserved for it.
In this setting or framework of enthu
siastic and cheering people lies an im
mense arena rilled with a moving and
spirited panorama of floral color, decking
every description of vehicle, prancing
horses, uniformed drill corps on foot and
on horse, while the music of brass bands,
the blare of trumpets and throb ol drums
lend their spirit and charm.
That formed the body of the picture,
bat the accessories, the features leading
up to it, the opening act of the play, were
as charming in their delicacy as the latter
spectaclo was splendid in color and move
ment. The tribunes were entirely rilled,
i the framework of expectant humanity
rompleted, before the big central gates
were thrown open and the Americus Club,
i a regiment of well-drilled men in uni
i forms of white with yellow trimmings,
I and with band in like uniform, entered ai
I open order and marciied down the arena.
Every man carried, instead of a gun, a
I flag attached to a long pole. A stiff breeze
was blowing, and these flags, as did every
t l!i>,- and pennant about the ] lace, snapped
i merrily. They formed on both sides of a
j white muslin pathway that extended 100
! feet from the foot or the steps to the
| throne.
The royal party, in its plume-covered
equipage, made the circle of the arena,
receiving the plaudits of the multitude,
the Queen responding graciously to the
ovation. Then the Queen's carriage
i stopped at the extremity of the white
I pathway, the guard of honor presented
I arms and, led by the prune minister, the
! band playing a march, the Queen made
1 her slow, dignified way toward the throne,
and between the double tier of snapping
\ flags. Not until she was seated did the
; court ladies move.
Then they followed her, their groups of
pink and green and orange tinted silk
dresses being very effective as they came
down between the white uniforms and
lia^s and courtesied at the fool of the
throne.
The regiment in white then swung off,
j performed novae evolutions about the
arena and formed again to receive the gay
( chariot of the little 5-year-old floral queen
I with her retinue, escorted by human
bouquets. The little queen marched up
I the steps and was crowned and kissed Dy
j Queen Francesca. She was then seated in
i a chair ot roses, surrounded by her own
tiny court.
All being ready now the procession of
flower-bedecked vehicles was released and
began its riot of color and action. In this
regard the display was not superior to
what has been seen here, the improve
ment being in the arrangements for wit
nessing it.
The procession circled the arena twice,
passing first close to the tribunes and the
throne, and, having completed the cir
cuit, returned in the opposite direction on
Jan inner circle. This added greatly to the
j eenera: effect, rilling the whole arena with
] life and action and giving the spectators a
better chance to inspect and enjoy those
creations that struck the fancy.
During me whole procession a constant
and lively bombardment with flowers was
carried on between the people in the
tribunes and those in the vehicles, the
fragrant war being kept up to tbe music
of brass fcami-.
A great many novelties were introduced,
chlei of whicn were thp living bouquets
escorting the fl >ral Queen. Immense
bouquets of cut flowers were arranged of
paper, within the paper nandles of which
marched little urcains, who peeped
through holes provided for the purpose.
Ferd K. Rule, president of the Fiesta,
led the procession of vehicles. With his
wife he rode in a two-horse vehicle that
was resplendent with marigold yeliow.
Every part of the vehicle was hidden from
view. The harnesses of the horses were
covered with yeliow satin and the stream
ers and rosettes were o! u,e same color.
Mr. Rule wore a white costume. Mrs.
Rules costume was in white and yeiiow.
They were applauded continuously over
{he circuit and stormed with flowers.
Only the more conspicuous of the equip
ages in the long line may be mentioned
One of these was the tally ho of the Jona
than Club, upon which rode amove a
merry party Mr*. Mildred Howell Lewis,
Queen of the Fiesta of '96. The tallybo
was dressed in pink and white peas. Cap
tain Banning's Concord coach was the
vehicle employed to be the frarnewors for
this elaboration.
The entire conch was completely covered
with delicate fit wers. It was drawn by
six white horses, and their harnesses were
coversti with pink fichu. The animals
were also ornamented with pink ribbons
and rosettes that harmonized perfectly
with thÂ»- coloring on the coach.
Mrs. Lewis, who sat at the rear corner,
was elaborately and becomingly cos-'
turned. The ex-maids of honor, who
formed her party, were eowned :n white
and carried pi nit parasols. Those on the
coach were: MiÂ«iseÂ« Cora Goodrick, Ysi

Hattie Kimball, Sarah Innes, Bessie Bon
salJ, Ida Menefe, Leila Fatrchild, Harriet

Waters, E. M. BurÃoyne, L. J. C. Spru
ance. Hernlds carried pink and white
banners. Sixty thousand blossoms were
used in decorating this coach.
A glitnpsa of old-fashioned rural life,
with up-to-date embellivhrmnts, was viv
idly portrayed by a load of hay drawn by
four norst-s. The load from tlie harvest
field wa-s a creation in yellow mustard
blossoms. Seven charming haymakers,
with rakes on their shoulders and dressed
iÂ« airy summer costume, were on the load.
The iadi'.-s who maile up this party were:
Mrs B. W. Pridtiam. falsa A. M. North,
Mis* Gsaca Evans, Mis* B^lle Godin, Miss

sented a Grecian temple of learning, and
about it were maidens in Greek costumes.
They wore white robes and made an
attractive appearance. The floral design
was in the wiiite and yellow margueriies,
with drapingsof smilax. The younp ladies
who aj^peared were: Misses Mary Dobin

ended the festival of the flowers.
CLIMAX IU A GALA DAI.
lie* ta Vltitor* J i-it- a Dazzling Spee
tarte on the Wat*r.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 23.â The
water carnival at We^tlake park this even
ing was a fitting climax to one of the most
successful d&ys of the fiesta. Thousands
of people lined the banks of the lake on
every side and cheered enthusiastically
each successive feature of the programme,
from the picturesque arrival of the queen
and her court at. 8:30 o'clock to the last
rocket, which was fired shortly after 10
o'clock.
A salute of twenty-one guns announced
the arrival of the royal party at the east
side of the park, escorted by the queen's
lancers. Here they embarked in a Vene
tian gondola beautifully illuminated, and
after making a detour of the lake were
sa'ely landed at the boathouse. The latter
itself presented a pretty spectacle, espe
cially when viewed from the center of tne
lake.
Its upper portion, originally a band
stand, provided ample accommodation
for the queen and court and was brilliant
ly illuminated with yellow, green and red
incandescent lights arranged symmetri
cally in pyramid form.
The waters of the Jake were dotted in
all directions with illuminated craft, and
the floats formerly used in the str-et pa
rade were placed on rafts and anchored in
th- center, their fantastic outlines ren
dered clear and distinct by an ingeniously
arranged system of lights. The lake thus
presented the appearance of an almost
limitless expanse of water, and the illu
sion was made still more complete when,
shortly after 9 o'clock, the pyrotechnic
display commenced.
Th is portion of the evening's entertain
me nt was goreeons and rffective to a de
gree. The display included a production
of the celebrated Wooded Island illumina
tion at the World's Fair. Six illuminated
balloons, thirty feet hign, were released
early in the evening and these were fol
lowed by volley* of rockets, shells and
parachutes. A fairy fountain played in
cessantly on the eastern side of the lake
and a splendid succession of water fire
works added to the magnificence of the
spectacle.
One of the most effective pieces of the
display was a cascade of liquid eoluer. fire
forty foot long and falling trom an eleva
tion onto the lake. A grand finale was
produced by the simultaneous dvcharga
of 150 variously colored rockets from dif
ferent points along the shore of the lake.
The Catalina band supplied appropriate
music during the evening and added
greatly to the enjoyment of the visitors.
The water carnival as a whole was pop
ularly voted one of the most imposing
features of the entire fiesta. The arrival
of her Majesty in particular suggested a
scene from a romantic opera, and when
subsequently she and her court ascended
to the roof of the bouthouse, where th"
whole scheme of color was exposed to the
vivid rays of hundreds of incandescent
lamps, the effect would have been well
worthy of reproduction at the hands of a
Titian or a Veronese. Every detail of this
elaborate function wns carried out with
out a sinele hitch of consequence, and now
Mr. Kirkland, the chairm.in of the water
varnival committee, is being universally
coneratulaied on th happy result of the
efforts of himself and his colleagues.

IDLE LABORERS
CAPTURE A TRAIN
Leffingwell's Army in
Possession of a
Freight.
Board the Cars at Lodi and
Are Finally Hauled to
Stockton.
Sheriff Cunningham Will Attempt
to Oust the Band This
Morning.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 23.â The army
of the unemployed has returned to Stock
ton. It had been in Lodi all day and de
spite the earnest efforts of the citizens of
ihat pl?ce to get the idle men to move
eastward they sturdily refused to do so.
At 10:30 o'clock this forenoon they seized
a freight tra n that pulled into Lodi, and
they are now on it. The men intend to
remain on this train until they are ar
rested or taken on to trie East, whither
they claim they want to go.
This afternoon a delegation of the citi
zens of .M>di waited upon the men and
offered to pay their fare on the evening
passenger '.rain as far as Galu This would
involve the expenditure of 30 cents per man,
but the leaders refused to accept t!ie gener
ous offer made by the Lodi peoplÂ», as
Leader LelliiiKwell said that the men pro
posed to force the Southern Pacific Com
pany to transport them as far as its lines
went. He said that his men wanted to go
to the East, but when the people of Lodi
offered to help them par', of the way on
their journey their offer was refused.
Leflir.gwell was asked by The Call cor
respondent v.nat he proposed to ao, and
he said i hat every man had instructions
to remain on tbe freight train that had
been seized by the unemployed at Lodi,
and that they should stay by it until they
were arrested. Deputy Sheriff Wall tried
to convince him that he was doing wrong
in seizing a train, but Leflingwell would
not listen to argument and said that the
men wanted to be arrested. As Sheriff
Cunningham waa not here Wall did not
feel like arresting and throwing 250 men
on the county. Leffingwell and his fol
lowers admitted that they bad oeen made
a very fair offer by the citizens of Lodi.
The station agent received orders not to
move the train under any circumstances,
and the men decided to camp on the box
cars and the flatcars during the nieht
The citizens of Lodi talked of forming a
vigilance committee and forcing them to
leaye town, but later they decided to do
what' th y could toward feeding them.
Tney agreed that they did not want to
make the '250 men who bail captured the
freight train angry, and thus incite a riot,
so they provided enough provisions to
give each ot tuem a good meal to-night.
Just as tbe army was finishing its re
past an order was received from Lodi to
send the captured freight train with its
load back to Stockton. They reached
here shortly before 10 o'clock and hun
dreds of citizens were at the railway sta
tion to see what the men proposed to do.
Chief of Police Kingsbury and his force
were on bund, but the men said that they
intended to remain on board the cars and
carry out their determination to force the
Southern Pacific Company to carry them
eastward.
It is understood here that the train was
brought back to Stockton because of an
agreement that was reached this after
noon between the Southern Pacific of
ficials and Sheriff Cunningham, and thai
the latter will be here early to-morrow
morning on a freight train to make the
leaders of the unemployed abandon their
position or suffer the consequences.
Trouble is lookrd for, as the citizens will
not permit Leffingwell and bis followers
to dictate to them or to break the ordi
nances of this city.

0. Gordon started back fox bis old home
at Leeton, Mo., this morning with an Or
egon boot or. his leg. Ho is the youru
man who several days ago walked into
the Sheriff's office hungry and travel
worn and asked to be locked up. He told
ili" officers his name and the crime for
which he was wanted and, while they ac
commodatingly imprisoned him, they
were inclined to doubt his story until con
firmatory telegrams, were . received from

'"Take off your hat, whispered Deputy
Sheriff Wall.
He pulled the tile from his bead and
listened to the charge with an expression
of indifference. When asked if he de-ired

whether he wanted his wife or his sister

His bail was fixed at $3000, and being

and debate to-morrow nnu inve the team
an enthusiastic send-off. Dr. Jordan, Dr.
RosÂ«, Prolessor Latbrop, Dr. Wood, Pro

students at Stanford addressed the meet

said:
"There is something better than victory

victorious. It is that the spirit of fair

I tmiik that spirit has entered into all of
the contents thus far. Stanford has al
ways 'stood together' in any contest.
There is always good team work, and
many of our victories were due to the fact
that t be students stand as one."
Then he mentioned by name two
students who have had charge of many of
the^affairs of the student body this year as
deserving of spfci.ii notice.
Dr. Ross, who assisted in preparing the
debating t?am. said he thought Stanford

CROPS IN NEED OF RAIN.
Sught Damage Dene in Some Sections
by the Recent Warm
Winds.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 23.â For the
past two days a heavy north wind has pre
vailed in ail parts of this county. It will
not affect the grain on the islands so
much as in the uplands, where there is not
so much moisture. The crops in this
county are iarger than they have been in
years. The acreage sown is greaier, and
thus far the yield is above any previous
year. Especially is this so on Roberts Isl
and and Union Island, where a large acre
age has been planted and where the re
sults have been gratifying. It the high
win. l is followed by light warm showers
no damage will result to the crops on the
uplands.
FRESNO, Cal., April 23.â The hot spell
of the past few days, together with dry
winds from the north which have pre
vailed at times, has had a serious effect on
the crowing grain in this county. A
shower would have made the yield a
heavy one, but now it appears that it will
be light. The season had been a most
propitious one until the warm weather set
in and dried up the soil. The damage
varies in different sections and is probably
htavier on the west side of the valley.
HOLLISTKK, Cal., April 23.â The north
winds have not reached this valley to a
great extent. Crops are looking well and
only a few showers neetied to make a great
harvest. In the southern part of the
county crops have suffered from the late
hot spell. Wild feed is about gone in that
locality. Hay cutting has commenced.
Tue crop will be large.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 23.â From
reports received from various portions of
Sacramento County, it seems that the
north wind has as yet had but very little
effect on the grain crop. There are places
i on the higher plum land where the wind
{ has so evaporated th* moisture that the
grain is yellowing, but much of the grain
land throughout this county requires only
a few late rains to produce a good yield.
COLUSA, Cal., April 23.â The "severe
norther that hus been blowing down the
Sacramento Valley during the past few
days has had a blighting effect on the
growing grain, especially that late sown,
which oh account of the very dry condi
tion of the ground in many places has not
sprouted. Should the wind continue a few
days more not more than two-thirds of a
crop will be realized. Tne wind has also
caused considerable fruit â especially the
apricots â to drop, and the apricot crop in
this section will be very light.
SAN BERNARDINO PASTOR'S FEE.
Rev. Dr. Frost Rewarded With $5 arid a
Beer Check for Presiding at a
Wedding.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal.. April 23.â
Dr. J. A. Frost, a local Baptist minister,
has in his possension as unique a marriage
fee perhaps as it has been the lot of a man
of the cloth to receive.
Last Saturday night he was called upon
to perform a marriage ceremony for Floyd
G. Kirlain and Lora
Dodson. At the ap
pointed time he was
on hand and after in
specting the necessary
document, obtained
from the County
Clerk, he proceeded to
tie the Knot in his pe
culiar off-handed man
ner.
The ceremony over,
the groom invited the doctor to indnlge ia
a glass of wine, and wh'le toasting the
event he slipped into the reverend gentle
man's hand two shining pieces of metal
that he had unearthed from his vest
pocket. The parson, without looking,
passed them into the outer recesses of his
own capacious garment (the doctor is 6
feet 6 inches high and weighs 350 pounds),
and after wishing the bride and groom the
longest ana happiest of lives, took his de
parture.
Arriving at his home the doctor pro
ceeded to see what was the net result of
his labors and sought his gold pieces. Im
agine his surprise when he brought forth
one shining $5 gold piece and a beer check
which the groom had gathered in his trav
els during the day.
The doctor was dumfounded. In vain
he searched for the other gold piece, but it
did not appear. The true state of affairs
finally dawned upon him, and settling
himself in his lar^e chair he Droke forth
in peals of laughter that aroused the
neighbors and his own household, to
whom he told the story and shr wed the
bit of gilded brass. In response to a ques
tion what he would do with it he an
swered that at the next meeting of the
Southern California Anti-Saloon League,
of w huh he is president, he intended to ex
hibit it as the most remarkable wedding
fee ever obtained by a minister in the
world.

lar manner, but recovered it from the

and disappeared before Captain Cross re
alized what had occurred. After a time
he spotted the man who he believed had
robbed him. Tuis individual Cross
ctmrged with the theft. The fallow denied

DROWNED IN SALT RIVER.
Seven Lives Lost Within Three Weeks at
a Treacherous Ford Near
PI (B nix.
PHCENIX, Ariz, April 21â la three
weeks the Salt River has claimed seven
victims. The last three were John Skel
ton, a bricklayer; Miss May Murrill and
an unknown man. They were seen to at
tempt to ford the river near Phoenix a few
days ago. The current was strong and
deep, and the watchers on shore saw the
waizon tip over and precipitate its occu
pants into the water. The body of tha
unknown man was recovered. He and
his companions were on their way to Sil
ver City. The bodies of May Murritl and
the stranger have not bnen recovered, but
several persons at different points are
searching for them.
These seven casualties in three weeks
have again aroused public interest in the
old question of a bridge across Salt River
at Phcenix. For several months both
fording and ferrying have been either im
possible or very dangerous.

WENT TO DEATH
WITHOUT A FEAR
Murderer Frank Kloss
Executed at San
Quentin.
With Firm Step and Calm
Demeanor He Mounts
the Gallows.
His One Request Is That the Story
That He Abusort His Mother
Be Dented.
IBAN QUENTIN, CaiÂ», April 28.â Frank
C. K!oss, the murderer of William F.
Deady. went to h\> death to-dny on the
gallows without uttering a word in ac
knowledgment of toe crime charged
against, him.
Promptly at 10:30 o'clock this morning
the prisoner was brought from the con
demned cell through tbe passageway lead- j
ing into the executicn-room. Father La
pan of San Rafael led the way, and Kloss
marched between two guards. He mount
ed the stairs leading to the sallows with a
lima step, his left hand sliding along the
railing. Not a trace oi fear was exhibited
in his conduct as he took his position on
the trap. Suddenly ho recognized an ac
quaintance among the spectators assem
bled about the gallows, and leaning for
ward he bowed his recognition. The same
cool, indifferent air which ne had exhib- ;
iied since his conviction and imprison- !
ment remained with him until the last.
Father Lagan faced the spectators, about
forty being present, and said that Klofs '
had requested him to say a few words. It !
was the dying request of the man, de- j
clared the prinst. that he wished to deny \
the story published In n San Francisco !
morning paper to the effect that he had I
treated his poor old mother brutally and;
cursed her when she came to see him at i
tbe prison.
When Father Lagan closed his remarks i
the noose was placed about the condemned
man's neck by AjbOs l.unt, when the pris
oner turned to him and, in an undertone, j
said: "Do a cood job." Tuese were the
la?t words he uttered upon earth. The
black cap was pulled over his head ; Lv nt
tightened the rope about his neck and ',
gave the sisrnal. The trap flew open and !
K'oss dropped to the end of the rope. His
neck was broken by the fail. Twelve mm- i
utes later Dr. Lav-lor declared him to be '
dead.
When Warden Hale went into the con
demned ceil at 10 o'clock in the mornine
to read the death warrant he found Kloss
with Father Lagan. Warden Hale in
formed him of the mission ho vras about
to perform, when Kioss said that he knew
vrhat he was to beexecuted for and waived
the formality, saying that he would rather
orend the time with the priest. The
warden withdrew.
Last night the condemned man, after
writing a letter to his brother, retired at
about 11 o'clock. He awoke at :; o'clock j
in the morning and asked the death- !
watch what time it was. Then for a half!
hour he engaged in conversation with \
Guard Jones and toid him much ot his
t>Â«st life. At G:2O he arose ami asked tht
guard for his best suit of clothes. They
fitted him perfectly, a fact which plea-eJ
him creatly. His hat he requested the I
guard ;o deliver to his bro:her. Ha ate
breakfast and took a stimulant and sa.d
to the cuara that he intended to mount
the gallows like a brave man. At no
time had he exhibited the white feather,
and alter bidding the deathwatch good-by !
he prepared for his de*th.
Frank C. Kloss wa? convicted of the |
murder of WiJlidm P. Dftady in a Hhv s i
Va;lev saloon in ifan Francisco in 18%. ;
Kloss was under the influence of liquor I
and when he entered the saloon ho found
his victim lyinc asleep in a chair with his
head thrown back and a tempting array j
of throat displayed. The evening before j
the men had engaged in an altercation. '
When K.oss went over to the sleeping !
man he shook him by the shoulder, but
J>esdy did not awaken. Kloss shook'him
toe second time with the same result,
when with an oath he ur< w a knife and
slashed the throat of his victim. It was a j
cowardly, cold-blooded murder, but Kloss
t ontended that it was committed by him
in self-defense.
It is said that Kloss made the state
ment tnat Durrant confessed to him the
murders of BJancbe La.mont and Minnie !
Williams while tha tv.o were confined in '
the County Jail in S.in Francisco. This I
story is not considered true. It is be- j
lieved that Kloss made uu the yarn in j
order to get even with Durrant for some
trouble which the two had in the County i
Jail. They had been enemies and those
in close touch with both oay.tnat Durrant
would never have se ected Kloss as a con- '
f.dant if he intended to confess.
HAZGEIi AT JTKXDAT RARHOR.
farmer Straub Krrcxit-d. for the Kiliiny
of a y*ighbor.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 23.â H. H.
Etraub was hanged at Friday Harbor
in Island Connty this afternoon, about 1
o'clock. When at the last moment he
was informed that the Governor had re
fused to interfere, the condemned man
could scarcely atand for the adjustment of
the black cap. His neck was broken by
the fall.
Straub murdered Leon Lanterman, a
Blakely Island farmer, on August 30, 1895.
The trouble grew out of matters pertain
ing to the public school lands of the
island. According to the evidence Straub
lay in wait for his victim, and after the
â  hooting of Lanterman took to the woods,
vowing he would never be taken alive.
Sever*! days la;ar he surrendered to a
Sheriff's posse. Many of his neighbors on
the island believe that Lanterman was not !
the first man he had murdered.
StrauD had a brother and sister livinâ¢ at
Coupeville, Wash., who did all in their
power to save him. Governor Rozers an
nounced that he would not commute the

SAM DIEGANS REFUTE A RUMOR.
Ridicule the Report That Jesse Grant
Received Money From the Grant
Memorial Committee.
SAN* DIFAiO, Cat.., April 23.â The dis
patch sei;t on; from Now York on Wednes
day nicnt, to tne effect that Jesse Grant
had requested tne Grant memorial com
mittee to send $l">0 to defray his expenses
to the memorial services attending the
dedication of the Grant monument, was
read here to-day aud soon the story was
general on the street-. Unusual interest
was taken in tee report, because this city
is the home of Mr. Grant and family, and,
while no one believed the story, there was
considerable curiosity to learn from what
Â«ource it emanated. Judge George Pater
bangh, who is a close personal friend of Mr.
Grunt ns well as a business associate, was
seen this evening and asked concerning
the dispatch.
"The Etory." said Judge Puierbaugh,
"is Utterly ridiculous, and while on ac
count of Mr. Grant's absence, 1 cannot
positively deny it, 1 would be perfectly
willing to bet a million do'lnrs to a cent,
and offer to give back the cent if I won,
that there is not a scintilla of truth in it.
In the first place Mr. Grant left San Di
ego lor Mexice on an important business
trip over three weeks ago and has not yet
returned. In tbe second place, if he had
â¢ranted $150, which be did not, there are
fifty men in this city who would ha 76
been glad to let him bave it for as long a
time as lie wanted it. In the third place,
if he were 'hard up' and needed the
money for the trip, he would certainly
have tried to get enoueh to pay at least
some considerable part of his expenses.
"Mrs. Grant and the two daughters â
one of them. Miss Nellie, a young lady of
17 years â left for New York on the limited
Tuesday morning. The railroad fere alone
for the party, including sleeping accom
modations, will be over jfttOO. The bonnets
of the ladies cost more than (180. Non
sense! The story is absurd. If Mrs.
(â¢rant needed money she could have got
it from her father, Hon. W. 8. Chapman
of San Francisco, or Mrs. I*. S. Grant or
U. B. Grant Jr., ora score ot others, with
out making public the matter at all.
"There are only two ways to account
for the story. Either it was *Â«?nt out by
some correspondent who was misinformed
or inspired by some animus, or else there
if a frrain of foundation in the possible
fact that Genera: Porter might have wired
him $!,7) as a compliment of the commit
tee. Bat Jesse Grant is too generous to
be mean and 100 much of a gentleman to
ask nny one to help him in the way indi
cated."
lion. A. J. O'Connor, rrceiver of the
Consolidated National Bank, and a close
acquaintance ol Grant's, says the siory is
silly and confirms Judge Puterbaugn's
remarks. The same answer wÂ«s made by
Judge J. Wade McDcnali and others.

This city wai getting uncomfortably

On the day of his depanura he said that
he would no longer pursue "bnnkoing"

A special from Ro-siand says that the
British Marshal of the town had no confi
dence in the professed reformation of the
aged gambler, whose reputation had pre
ceded him there. He scarcely had stepped
off tn* train when Marshal KirKup tapped !
him on the shoilder and calling "Sandy"

imagined himself to be in clover, but tae
next minute the Marshal told him that
Rossland was overcrowded and advised
him to recross the border with as little
delay as possible.
Olds, knowing that Kirkup's word is
law in Rossland, did not stand upon the
order of leaving, and he is now in
Spokane. There it is believed he will re

of his ability- as department commander.

PETALUUA'S LADIES' MINSTRELS.
T.ckeis for the Coming Burnt-Cork
Entertainment Are Already
Ex/icusied.
PETALUMA, Cal., April 23-Next
Tuesday evening will witness the solution
of the great mystery which is now agi
tating that portion of Petaluma's 400 who
are not "in it," for then the iong-t:Â»lked
of ladies' minstrels will give their enter
tainment and make their corkblack bow
to an expectant audience. Rehearsals
have been frequent, and though inter
rupted by much merriment, one and all,
from present appearances, have their
parts down to perfection.
Whiie the greatest ?rcrecy has been
maintained, rumors will fly about, and it
is said that the wile of one of Petaluma's
most prominent merchants will occupy
the position of "middle man," while the
wife of v prominent medico will be one of
the four 'end men," and so on through
the list. But the most absorbing matter
of interest is that of costume. Will the
clubladie^b- attired in bloomers, short
skirts orâ tights? These queries will "re
main unanswered till the rise of the
curtain.
One feature of the entertainment that
is announced is that MiÂ«s Oleta Lunt of
San Franci-co will appear iv a character
song and dance.
Tne ladies have further proved their
progressive ideas by formally requesting
tuat all large hats be duffed during tne
performance, that every one may have an
unobstructed view.
Mrs. Crank, the general artist and sign
painter, whose independent costume has
become a familiar sight on Petaluma's
streets, has painted unique signs adver
tising the entertainment.
For the first time, almost, in the annals
of the city, the ruÂ«h for seats was so great
that on tbe first day ail desirable seats
were reserved, and already tbe announce
ment is of "standing room only."
FRESNO WITNESS BLUNDERS.
Important Point Scored by the Defense
in the Trial of Professor
Sanders.
FKE6NO, Cm.., April &â ln the cross
examination of Carl Eisenschimmel, the
handwriting expert of San Francisco
i broucht to Fresno by the prosecution for
â  the forgery trial of W. A. Sanders, the de
fense to-day scored a Very important
point. Whether it was a trap sprung by
I Attorney SUort or a mere accident must
\ be conjectured, but the fact remains that
the lawyer succeeded in givinc a hard
' blow to the reliftl iiity of tne expert's tcs
i tiniony. Mr. Eisenschimniel has been
! very positive in pronouncing the sicna
. tures to the Wontton draft and deeds to
!be forgeries, lie gave his testimony in a
'< thorough and intelligent manner, and it
; went far \o convince the jurors of the guilt
j of the defendant.
The expert was under the tire of a vigor
ous cross-examination for about a day
and acquitted himself creditably. He
j maintained his eeil-composurn through
j out, and, desp.te the vigorous efforts of
j the defendant's attorney, his testimony
I could not be shaken.
But this afternoon Mr. Eisenschimmel
i became somewhat irritated. Then it was
I that he gave the hasty statement whicb
j seriously reflected on his ability as an ex-
I pert. The point gained by the defense
was that the exj crt pronounced a letter
to have been simuated by the defendant,
while, in fact, it had been written by a
person not connected with the case at all.
Attorney Short submitted to the expert a
! private letter irom Captain E. A. yon
Schmidt ot San Fr&ncisco, but the witness
! was, of course, not made aware of who the
writer was or to wiiom the missive was
addressed. Alter examining the letter ior
I a few minutes, Mr. Eisenschimmel ex
pressed the opinion ibaiithad been simu
lated by ttic de;endant on trial.
â¢â¢That'- all," said Attorney Short, and
he relinqnished the witness.

RICHES RECOVERED
THROUGH A DREAM
Relatives of a Dead Man
Find His Buried
Fortune.
Told of Its Hiding Place by
an Apparition as They
Slept.
Follow the Instructions Given to
Them and Are Well Re
warded.
PORTLAND, Oe., April 23.-A family
named Marriott, living at Bertha, a few
miles from here, received on the 15th of
February last advice of Mrs. Marriott's
father's death at Marietta, Ohio, says the
Evening Telegram. Five nights later
Miss Elsie, the eldest daughter, dreamed
that her deceased grandfather appeared
before her and giving her a map of his
place near Marietta instructed her where
to dig and recover his buried cash. He
admonished her to delve lor it in person.
The loliowing morning at the breakfast
fable the girl related her dream, and to
the amazementof theothers Mrs. Marriott
stated she had had a similar dream the
preceding nizht, with the exception that
her father told her none but Miss Elsie
must unearth his buried money.
There was a greater tangibility about
these dreams than would appear on the
surface. Just Defore the panicky times in
1893 Mrs. Marriott's futher was known to
have considerable money on deposit in
the banks, but when the crash came be
frequently said that lie had not lost a dol
iar. However, he refrained from stating
how he escaped the unlucky fate of many
other depositors. Inquiry elicited the
fact that the old man had withdrawn his
funds a month or two before the bankiag
iiouses began to crumble.
The Marriotts were so influenced by
thosa dreams that Miss Elsie returned to
Ohio the middle of last month, and she
and her brother, Harold, began an investi
gation. From time to time tne Marriotts
received letters from her, but none of
them of a hopeful nature. Her parents
were about to write to her to abandon the
search for dreamland fortunes and re
turn home, when on Sunday last intelli
gence reached thera th:a her perseverance
had been richly rewarded.
Miss Elsie wrote that the dream chart
she accepted as a guide had proved in
correct; but, nevertheless, after she and
Harold hud plowed over twenty acres of
ground the latter struck an old coal-oil
can at a depth of about two feet. It con
tained the money and bonds her grand
latlaer bad taken out of the banks. In nil
they amounted to $17,00J, of wi^ch $10,000
was in gold coin.
The rest of the Marriott family went
back to their otd home last Wednesday
night.
UTAH OUTLAWS ESCAPE.
Pursuit of the Pleasant Valley Rcbbers
Has Been Practical// Aban
doned.
SALT LAKE, Utah, April 23. -The pur
suit of the men who robbed E. L. Car
penter at Castle Gate on Wednesday of
?7*oo, which was to have been used in
paying off the employes of the Pieasant
Valley Coal Company, has virtually been
abandoned. Mr. Carpenter himself said
to The Call representative to-day tnat he
deemed further search useless, as the rob
bers had undoubtedly reached that por
tion of the San Rafael country known ss
the "Robbers' lloost," and once in these
mountain fastnesses they wero safe from
capture.
Two of the rosses in pursuit had a little
battle yesterday, each mistaking the other
for the supposed robbers. A couple of
horses were killed, and it was surprising
that no human lives were lost.
There is come talk about organizing a
bi^ posse, with the idea of attacking the
stronghold of the robbers with dynamite.
It is believed the gang could be routed in
that manner, but the country in which
the outlaws rendezvous may not be able
to stand the financial strain. The $4000
reward offered may stimulate some ad
venturous spirits to make a bank account
and a name for themselves at the same
time.

It Makes People Well.
There is one true specific for diseases arising from a debilitated nervous Bystem i
and that is Paine's celery compound, so generally prescribed by physicians. It ia
probably the most remarkable remedy that the scientific research of this country nas
produced. Prof. Edward E. Phelps. M.D., LL.D., of Dartmouth college first pre-
scribed what is now known the world over as Paine's celery compound, a positive cura
for dyspepsia, biliousness, liver complaint, neuralgia, rheumatism, all nervous dis-

TWO ANNIVERSARIES.
How Captain Thomas Desmond Res- |
cued Fenian Prisoners l'rom
Free mantle.
Monday, the anniversary of the battle
of Lexington, was also the twenty-first I
anniversary of the rescue of several
Fenian prisoners from the Freemantle
Prison in Australia. The project was
boldly conceived and bravely carried out.
Captain Thomas Desmond, ex-Sheriff
of San Francisco, and Captain S. P.
Smith were the heroes of the latter oc
casion. Supplied with funds by the
F*nian organizations they proceeded
to New Bedford. Mass., where they char
tered the whaling vessel Catal'ra and
placed on board a sturdy crew of Fenians, i
armed to the teeth. * â 
Intheeuiseof a peaceable whaler the
Catalpa dropped anchor not far from the
prison. By the aid of confederates on
shore the prisoners were taken out of their
cells and carried in the ship's boats to the
whaler.
They had hardly cot over the side be
fore the escape was discovered, and as the
Catalua with all bails set turned her prow
toward California and her heels. to the
enemy she was pursued by a tug contain
inâ¢ a score of British guards armed with
rifles, sabers and revolvers.
The Caialpa was overtaken about three
and a half miles from shore â on the high
seasâ and the American flag was run un
to the peak. *
The Britishers called upon Desmond
and Smith to deliver the prisoners For
answer they were told that the prisoners
were on the deck of an American vessel
and protected by the flay. Then two
brass cannon loaded and ready for action
poked their noses .over the "rail of thÂ«
whaler.
"Get out of here or we'll blow you out
of the water." commanded Captain Des
mond.

Australia. The prisoners were landed in
San Francisco and there was much rejoic
ing over the rescue.
An adequate effort is at last to be made
to prevent the extinction of the elephant.
The Government of India nas adopted a
regulation preventing ;he killing of these
animals in a reserve which extends from
SheiKu Pass to the Afghanistan frontier.
The area is approximately 200 miles by
SU. The herds of elephants which remain
in this reserve are at present confined to
a much smaller area of about forty miles
square of the Gadabural Mountains.

A bicycle race with a panther was the
exciting experience of an English lady in
Singapore one evening. When riding
slowly homeward along a road outside
the town the cyclist found that she was
being quietiy stalked by a huge black
panther. She had the presence of mind
to start off at full speed and soon dis
tanced her pursuer.

Favorites did a little better at Ingleside
yesterday, taking lour of the six events
on the card. The attendance was quite
up to the average and thie betting pood.
The race that earned dismay, suffering
and sorrow in one camp was the second.
Bt aihrol, running in Sam Hildreth's
co.ors, came out for the first time in mtiny
moons and wa> tQ have been the medium
of a "killing." It was such a "good
â¢ uing" that many speculators in the East
had it passed to them over the wire.
Dunne's cast-off opened at twos and was
sledge-hammered down to 6 to 5 and even
money. And then he could not win. even
with the valuable assistance contributed by
several other starters in the race, fle
did not care to exert himself the first part
despite Shields' desperate urging and was
led past the wire by Amelia Fonso, a 5 to
1 chance, rid ten by Claw? on, who quite
evidently bad not been Landed a ticket to
slip in his boot.
'ihe Inverness filly Marvelous was
heavily played in the opening four-and
a-hair furlone scramble for two-year-olds,
but away third was never able to better
her position. Marty Bergen on the 6 to
1 choice Socialist was away first, and after
rnakine all tne running was only beaten
out the last few yards by the oddly named
Dousterswivel a 10 to 1 shot piloted by
Jimmy Bozeman.
On Thursday, in a mile race, Refugee
opened favorite and went back in the
betting. If he possessed any speed on
that occasion Thompson could not or
would not extract n from him. Yester
day the sprinter opened a 6 to 5 choice for
the third event at seven luriongs, reced
ing to 2>Â£ to 1. Then a bis chunk of coin
went in, forcing his odds down to 3 to 2.
HÂ« got away fir-t an.! palloDed in the win
ner with ridiculous ease, four lenpths or
so in Iront of McFartane, a 12 to 1 out
sider. La Mascota and one or two others
ran as though s;anding in on the "shove."
The secon 1 two-year-old event went to
the even-money favorite, Rev Salazar. He
was the only horse in the race backed to
.any extent and after lying second to Miss
Kcmsen until well on toward the wire,
won easily by a length. Miss Retnsen
clowned Flushington two lengths for the
place.
Bookmaker George Rose's fleet filly
Tor-ma was a 1 to 2 chance for the fifth
event at six furlong*, and after running
second to Potentate to the stretch, pulled
away and won under wraps. In a hard
drive, Midas got the show from Redding
ton by a head.
The crack Vinctor again struck a soft
spot. He was a6to 5 choice for the last
event, over one mile and a sixteenth, and
in a mild drive downed Imp. Trance a
neck in 1:48%. Grady, ridden by Cole,
was an indifferent third.
NOTES.
According to reports Eataca has been
eoing great guns and is sweetly smiled on
by the stable employes. The track,
which hat been harrowed up, is just to his
liking, and he will be hard to beat to-day.
Flu&hington, after being taken up at tbe
end of a quarter, ran a splendid race ana
will do to have a bet on next time he
starts.

Theie is nothing like rolling a barrel

Torsina, winner of thp lifth event, en
tered to be sold for $500, was bid up to
$1500 by A. Joseph, the accredited owner
of Potentate, although. th- horse races In
the name of J. H. Shields. Torsina runs
in the colors of George Rose, and the
bookmakers wisely protested payment of
the run-up money on the ground that
Potentate is not owned by Mr. Shie'ds.
Mr. Joseph, it is said, also owns Joe
Terry, played throughout the country on
Thursday for a "killing," and one or two
ol that horse's performances mi ht cause
Mr. Joseph to look wise if asked to ex

THE BIRD CAME HOME.
After Three Month* and a Half He
Escaped His Prison
Bars.
Homing pigeon 1093, with a filmy alum
inum band on one of v:? ankle-, set nflieht
in Sacramento on January 5 iast
and strangely lost since then, yes
terday arrived at the home of his owner,
Juhn F:!mer, at 336 Jersey street
Undoubtedly, as his owner believes, the
bird has been in captivity somewhere be
tween here and Sacramento, aud has just
been let loose because of the law recently
passed making it a misdemeanor to hunt
or detain a pigeon. The fact that some of
the tail feathers had been pulled out, and
the aluminum band removed, seemed to
indicate this.
The remarkable thing, however, about
the return of t c bird is that it is now out
nine months old. and has been in captiv
ity for more than a third 1 of that time. It
seems strange it would recollect its bear
ings. The pigeon is a California-strained
bird. It shows that ai good bird- can be
raised here as elsewhere.
The occasion for letting loose of the
featuered biped was the prize contest for
which a rm> was offered by Mr. Crowiey.
About 250 birds were let loo^e, and only
150 came home Mr. Filmer let loose five
birds during the training, and there are
three of them of which he has yet heard
nothing.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 24, 1397.
THE LAW OF SACRIFICE.
As we study the gradual casting off of the fetters which bind the soul to rebirth we come to
that which is the most efficient agent in this workâ the law of sacrifice. All must have been
struck with the fact that there Is not a religion In the world that has not sacrifice as one of its
essential ideas. Tfike the highest religion that tne world has known, or take the lowest, and
still you can discover no religion, whether of the hichest sect or of tly lowest savage, that has
not the sacrificial idea for its center. The nature of the sacrifice will differ with the notionsof
the people among whom is the religion; the nature of the offering will depend on the grade o
evolution which the soul has reached. But however crude vhe conception or poor the working
out, however low and mean and unintellectual the idea of sacrificÂ» may be, none the less out of
that poor and base conception, if you look at the lives of the people, out of it you will find have
grown tha nobl.s; impulses which these people have known.
Consider the doctrine of the atonement in one of its lowest and crudest forms. Tfike it
amon;; the most ignorant people, who put it in a form repulsive to higher thought, you will
findâ 'f you look at it in its working out In the lives of'the people, in the inner regions where
words are so little and thought is so much â you will find thnt out of a burlesqued idea of
sacrifice there hai grown the name high and exquisite devotion which la the glory of every
religion and every phase of creed. Let us see if we can catch a climpse ol what this means.
In the highest regions of the universe those who nave nchieved, thoÂ«e who have gone far
beyond the range where or r limited Right can follow or where our fettered thought enn touch;
who have entered into the highest regions that we yet have knowledge of; these breathe out
of that sunreme life ray* which have in them something of themselves. They can send ihese
rays downward into a life that is exceptionally pure, excaptiona'.ly devoted and spiritualized,
overshadowing that nature which is mighty by its purity, a'thoush it has not yet perhaps
climbed to heights of knowledge. They can thus lend to it a divine quality, can breathe
into It a divine power, and by the assent of that pure nature, by a real act of sacrifice, which
that pure one is wlUlng to make, such a one enn be raised into a position where he becomes
a source from which spiritual life may flow out to the wor.d, and into which, in etranee fashion,
the sorrow and the anguish of the world may pour; and, in return for the gift of sorrow, the
gift of spiritual life flows forth.
That :s the mystery which is always implied in the liTes of the great saviors of the world.
When It is said that "they are the sorrows of men." they "bore the sins of the world," It is
nota mere figure of speech; it is not a mere phrase, a dream which men have dreamed; It is a
reality of the spiritual life that ev>*ry soul of man which, by its aspirations, climb- upward to
the spiritual regions, reaches there a point where there is no division, wh re that soul In
stinct with the dlvinelife becotnc* one with all sou!s in their sorrow. Not by separation, but
by identification ; not by a forced pffection, bnt by the deepest reality of the spiritual life that
soul r aches the plane where division is not, where the world and it are one. And tnus it can
bear the world's burden, its sin and its sorrow. It can bear the world's ignorance and breathe
into the world its own divine life [and thus become at once ihe bearer of sorrows for man and
the source to man of spiritual life].
But not only for the nurest and noblest is this divine sharing of all things possible: not
only for those who are so abnolutelv pure that the divine life can send them forth as saviors
of the world: not only to them is this privilege given, but to others also according to their
smal'er measure. For every one who is willing to take on himself a pain that is not in his
Knrma, a sorrow that is not of his own past making, every soul which goes forward by that
divine passion that comes from within and not from without, and which says: "I am willing
to bear a pain that is not my own, willing to take a sorrow that is not of my own making, to
be made a sharer in the life that takes all grief that it may srive back all blessing," every soul
that takes part of this burden on itself changes the pain that it takes into love and Joy, which
through It are given to Ihe world.
Think of sacrifice in the for v w^ know it here. Think of that transmutation by fire that
goes on, on an earthly alt* r, when you throw on to it some substance of e-irth. and as the fire
pluys upon It it seems to chanre, so that all the grosser and more solid parts disappear, and
perchance there will rise from It a marvelous essence or incense frum the al;ar. It has
changed its character as the fir* 1 has worked upon it. Even so, upon the a!tÂ«r of the human
heart, it is possible to throw suffering into the fire of love che one great transmutine forci
that the earth knows, for love is divine, and it is the divine which everywhere transmutes
and changes), ivfTering which is not yours by compulsion, for then were it r>o free gift, suffer
ing that you tnke by â  our own voluntary acceptationâ that ytm ask to take that the world mr.y
thereby b<? helped. This pain that you put upon the altar is worked upon by the fire, is
changed, and gives out the very essence that is In it, coming forth as spiritual strength,
spiritual p' wer.
In the course of ages knowledge and power to help are won by the pain that we endure;
but in the higher regions of the universe that is done speedily which is dore slowly here;
wnat evolution here works om stage by stasre is done in a moment by this concentrated fire of
love, which is life. And so the disripi'e. as he rises higher and higher, at last makes cood hiÂ«
footing in the spiritual regions *nd is able to do in a moment "hat would tnke cen:uries or
millenniums in accomplishing here. He can take the pain and change it Into power and send
that spiritual life downward for the helpine of the world.
That is part of the law of sacrifice. As the disciple crows higher and higher he can do this
more nnd more; as he grows nearer and nearer to the One he can do it more swiftly nnd ever
to a greater extent, so that it last what he could do perchance only for the few he becomes
ablo to do for a !are?r number of his fell'>w-men. As he becomes one with them he is able to
siiare with them. You must rememb-r he takes from them as well us gives to them; but he
talt**s fmm them their sin and sorrow and gives back to them his life and love.
And there is even more â much more than that.
Ano'her way in wh.ch sacrifice is possible When the disciple, c'imbing upward, has
reached a stage at which consciousness can work I reÂ« ly on the higher panes, but at which he
may rot yet bring back perfectly memory of all he does, there is a possibility that pain may
be accepted there voluntarily, that falls on him when his consciousness i* dulled by its phy
sic il encasement. It has been thus taken by those who have giv.Â»n up desire for anything
that earth can pive, by those who have learned that the thintrs of the lower life matter but
little in the life of the soul, who are able to see the relative proportions <-f tnlngs, and by that
clear vision can choose bnter than it is possible to choose In the l'-.wer w>rld.
Give your suffering, make it your offering for the whole and it will change into spiritual
forces.
If only In yonr daily lives yon can do it now and thenâ not alwaysâ that would perchance
be too hard. But every time you do it, you make it easier *o di it nealn.
There is offered '.o you the joy of the higher regions, and there I leave it ; because all words
are vh'.h; all words seem almost irreverence, for speech is uot adequate, and here only soul
may speak to soul.
It v only the voice of the worldloss that can yolee it truly, for the words are not of earth ;
and -f the wor'ls of the speaker have mnrred the vision, and lackof'words have made the
b- auty seem less beau-lful, then as sou! I speak to soul. Not with mortal voice to mortal ears,
not with these poor words my <on*ue can utter, but from mv heart to yours, from my toul to
yours may come a thought that will tell you the light and the life are there.
For this which I have tried imperfectly to say m the very life of the universe, which
breathes in the Heart of every man from those great teachers oi wisdom. TMÂ« is the miehty
message which the masters ot compassion have sent to the toiling world. If it move not your
heart the fault is not in the message but In the messenger; It is not in the thought but iii the
speaker. Let your own hearts spcas: the message to yoiirs"!veÂ«. the message that only the
inner self can sptac to the outer, and you snail see I' c early, undimmed by human inter
ference.
For every man at least ii his own priest to the god within him, and no other hands may
touch without profanation the sacrifice which the human soul offers on the human heart to
that Self which is the Self of all.
EX-AUDITOR SMILEY
PASSES AWAY
It Occurs at the French
Hospital From Heart
Disease.
The Remains to Be Interred To-
Morrow in tbe Odd Fel
lews' Cemetery.
After an il lness of a few weeks'dura
tion Thomas J. L. Smiley, ex-Auilitor
and ex-Registrar of Voters, passed away
at the French Hospital yesterday at half
past 12 o'clock.
The deceased had Buffered from heart
disease and went to tbe nospital about
three weeks ago to be treated for that
complaint. He apparently rallied and
hopes were entertained of his ultimate
restoration to normal health. But on
Saturday he was stricken with paralysis
and the verdict of the physicians was to
the effect that he could not recover. He
lost consciousness at 10 o'clock Thursday
night.
Mr. Smiley wÂ«s 76 years of age, and
came tv California from his native city of
Philadelphia in 1849. He had been a
schoolteacher, but on reaching here went
into the auction business. Healsoatonce
became an active man of affairs. He was
identified wiln the Volunteer Fire De
partment, represented Howard No. 3 in
the board of delegates, and was president
of Brannan Engine Company. He was
also vice-president of the Vigilance Com*
mittee.
Governor Waterman appointed him
Registrar of Voters seven years ago, but a
year later Governor Mirkham removed
him. When Auditor David Stern died the
Board of Supervisorsappoin-.ea Mr. bmiley
to succeed i.im. Afterward he engaged in
the stock brokerage business.
The body was yesterday afternoon re
moved to Gray's undertaking-rooms. The
funeral will take place at 2 o'clock to
morrow afternoon either from some
church or from his former home on Brod
erick street. The interment will be in the
Odd Fellows' reraotery.
FRACTURED HIS SKULL.
A _ Ton- Year- Old Boy Fall* From a
V Fence* With Perhaps Fatal
'Result*.
John Warren, a 10-year-old lad, who
resides with his parents at 720 Tehatna
street, met with an accident yesterday
evening which may possibly result fatally.
The boy was ploying upon a fence in front
of his residence, when he lost his balance
and fell heavily to the concrete sidewalk.
He was taken to the Receiving- Hospital
where it was ascertained tnat he had sus
tained a fracture of the skull. The injury
was attended to by Dr. Weil, but the boy
is in a critical condition.

BURNED BY THE
FAMOUS X-RAY
A Butcher Claims to Have
Suffered From Its
Operation.
Thomas F. Marron Sues Dr.
Philip Miis Jones tor
Damages.
T .c first action at law to recover dam
ages for injuries sustained by reason of ex
posure to the famous X ray was besnn in
the Justice Court yesterday and will no
doubt result in interesting developments
if it conies to trial.
Toe man who claims that he suffered
great mental and bodily anguish after uav
ing been exposed 10 the piercing light that
emanates from tho Crookes tube is Thomas
F. Marron, a butcher who is employed by
S. P. Hicks at 2010 Fiilmore street.
In the complaint tiled yesterday he says
that Philip Mills Jones, M.D., the X ray
expert, is a duly licensed and practicing
physician and that he is advertised as the
director of be Waldeck X Ray Laboratory
at 808 Sutter street, and claims to be partic
ularly skillful in the use of Roentgen's re
markable discovery. That on March 9
last i.c called at the physician's headquar
ters and made arrangements to suomit
himself to the searching beam of the tube
lor the purpo-e o' ascertaining whether he
vaii suffering from internal disorder.
The operation took place on March 10
and 11, and Marron claims that it was so
carelessly and negligently conducted that
lie was seriously burned on the right siile
of his body from the neck to the waist;
tnat both skin and flesh were burned and
scorched, and that the injuries were of so
serious a character that they have not yet
healed.
He says that he has not been able to
attend to his business from the effect of
Uio burns, and that he has had to expend
$30 in doctors' bills in an effort to
have the injured skin regain its normal
condition. He ask-, in addition to the
amount paid the physician, $269 damages,
as compensation for the pain he has en
dured.
"I believe that malice on the part of
the patient's parents prompted the suit
against me," said Dr. Jones last evening,
"and I am not at all fearful that a judg
ment will be found against me.
"Some time ago the plaintiff in the suit
against me broke a hypodermic needle off
in his chest, and all efforts to locate the
troublesome bit of steel by ordinary
metbods proved without avail. It was
finally suggested that the needle miuht be
located by means of the X ray and I was
called upon to undertake the experiment.
"A few days af:er the young man bad
bpon subjected to the influence of the
X ray he complained of a burn between
his shoulder blades.
"It is true that he was subjected to the
rays for some time, and the influence may
have produced a slight irritation, but
nothing serious did or can come from it.'*
COILS TIGHTENING
AROUND LORING
Police Have More Evi
dence Regarding the
Death of His Wife.
The Deceased's Ante-Mortem
Statement Corroborated by
Several Witnesses.
The Coicner Exhumed the Remains,
bat They Were Mutilated and the
Autopsy Was a Fai ure.
Captain Bohen of the detective depart
ment is quite confident that be ha\ woven
a net of evidence uroutid Robert Loring,
the tinsmitb, that will send him to the
gallows for the murder of his wife.
In response to the request of the police,
Coroner Hawkins had the remains of Mrs.
Loring exhumed from Holy Cross Ceme
tery yesterday and taken to the Morgue.
It was the hope of the police the autopsy
would show that the peritonitis from
which the unfortunate woman died was
brought on by a kicking and beating ad
ministered by her husband. But in this
they were disappointed, for Drs. Galla
gher and Morgan, the autopsy surgeons,
found upon uncovering the body that a
post mortem examination had already
been periormed by somebody and further
that the very organs they were expected
to scrutinize had been removed.
This state of affuirs was something of a
surprise and the Coroner at once notified
the detectives regarding what had been
disiovered.
Investigation developed the fact that
after Mrs. Loring died at the W aldetk
Sanitarium Dr. J. C. Stinson and Doctress
Nathalie Celling, who had attended her in
ber illness, determined to make a post
mortem examination in order to deter
mine the exact cause of death. In other
words they wanted to know if Mrs. Lor
ing'sdyine statement to the effect that
tier condition was brought about by her
husbands violence, was true. They ex
plain now, so the pol;ce say, that their
object in not notifying the Coroner of the
case was to avoid notoriety and to save
Lorine's children. The latter would be
left l.elpless and homeless if ihe lather
were sent to jail.
Dr. Belling surrendered Mrs. Loring's
ante-mortem statement to Detective Gib
son yesterday, and it is now to be used as
the strongest part of the evidence when
Loring is taken into court. It is as fol
lows :
Dying statement of Mrs Mary Loring of 5
Gordon street:
I, Mary Loring, believing myself at the point
of death, do wmitigly find in my iull senses
make the following affidavit: That my hus
band, Robert Loring, seven weeks ago lest
Tuesday night, against my will, tried to kill
my unboru child, lie said he wuuld kill the
unborn babe, as he was tired of my bringing
Childten into the world. He was intoxicated
a: the time. He hug always maltreated me
and not supplied me with the necessities of
life. Ido solemnly swear this is true before
witnesses. Mrs. Mary Loring.
Witnesses â Mrs. M. Kipp, 511 Castro street;
Nathalie Belling, tU Sutler street.
Captain Bohen has an important list of
witnesses who will give evidence against
the man who is now sweltering in one of
the City Prison "tanks."
Mrs. M. Kipp, who was one of the wit
ne-ses to the dying statement, says that
the decease*) visited her al'out three weeks
and said .'-:je was suffering te r ble agony
as the resul : of the kick" she had received
in t.'ie abdomen. Sl.e was in a delicate
condition at the time and feared serious
results. Mrs. Loriug was lateen violently
ill before leaving the house, says Mr-.
Kipp, and bad 10 be -en t home in a coupe.
Bue never recovered from that illness.
Mrs. Kipp was also with her on the day of
her death.

TOE REASON WHY RIPENS TABULES CURE NERVOUSNESS
Docto*. The maladies which above all others cause nervousness are dyspepsia,
biliousness and constipation. The great sympathetic nerve which con-
nects the epigastric region with the brain is always injuriously affected
if the stomach and bowels are disordered ; a permnnent disarrangement
of the functions of those organs reacts by sympathy upon the entire
nervous system. Ripans Tabules in restoring tone and regularity to
the digestive apparatus, and overcoming constipation, permanently
remedy the nervous complains which originAte in alimentary weakness
or disturbances. They are the very best nervine that can be used.
By eradicating the exciting cause of nervous weakness they perma-
nently overcome the disability itself. But this is not all. By checking
the maladies which cause nervousness they build up anew the system
weakened and depleted by nervous disease.

The weather of Washington at this
season of the year is very pleasant, and

The Russian Embassador who told the
Bulgarian Government that this is not an
opportune time to ask for reforms from
Turkey has more than the usual allowance
of diplomatic gall. Bulgaria has been
waiting for just such an opportunity for
years.
In demanding immediate reforms from
the Sultan the Bulgarians have led a
trump card, and now the people of Mace
donia and Monieuegro must either follow
uuit or be guilty of a revoke. There is no
Question about their ability to play
trumps if they wish.
As the resolutions of sympathy with
Greece introduced into Congress are to be
accompanied with the usual declaration

jerfunctory vote of thanus.
Interest in tho coming pure-food con
press is felt all over the State, and the
gathering promises to be one of the most
important of the kind which has been
held in many years. This, at any rate, is
one San Francisco movement which the
interior cordially supports, and its results
can nardly fail to be widely beneficial.
When the present administration in
New York began its work the death rate
of the city for tne first three months of
the year was 25.34. In lSf*> the rate fell to
22.96, and this year it has diminished to
-0.31. The improved health i< attributed
to improved street cleaning, and there is a
lesson in it for every city in America, and
particularly for San Francisco.
It is not likely that the tariff bill will be
reported to the Senate until the Re
publican members of the Finance Com
mittee have so revised it ai to secure a
lull party support when reported. After
that debate on it will be perfunctory, as
neit:.er the Democrats nor the Populists
Will undertake obstructive tactics. The
interests of California, therefore, must be
looked after in the committee-room, and
now ia the time to do it.
The movement undertaken by the
Chamber of Commerce to develop and
promote our trade with South America is
one which should have the support of all
merchants and manufacturers in the
State. We will have strong rivals in our
rfforts to get the South American markets
for our productÂ«, but the rewards which
will attend success make it worth while to
enter the struggle, and there is no better
time to begin it than right now.
Tne question of precedence between the
Yice-P.esident and the Embassadors to
this country stirs Washington almost as
deeply as it would London or Berlin. To
the Western mind it does not seem to
make much difference which of two men
goes through a door first, so long as both
pet a front seat at the show and a good
placts at the table, but to the East it is a
matter of vait importance. There are
people who would be willing to abandon
our seal fisheries to England, surrender to
her claim on the Ala-kan boundary, leave
her a free hand in Venezuela and over
throw our protectire system in the inter
est of her merchants, who would never
theless be eager to fight her to a finish
rather than compromise a claim of official
precedence. There may not be much
virtue in etiquette, but there is none :he
less a strength in it against which it is
useless to preach, protest or kick.
THE TARIFF PROGRAMME.
According to well-informed correspondents at Washington the programme which
i has been adopted by the Republican leaders in regard to the tariff bill is to thoroiiEhly
i revise the tariff in committee, so as to make it fully acceptable to a majority of the
j Senators before it is reported to tte Sei ate. Under this policy the real debate on the
Dill will be in the committee, and when it comes before the Senate only enough
time will be given to Democrats end to other opponents of the measure to make such
speeches a-* they desire, and then the bill will be pressed to an early vote and the
controversy closed.
This beine the programme, it becomes important for the people of California to
give attention to the bill at once, while it is still in the bands of tne committee, for it
is not likely that the majority will be willing to reopen the whole question by consid
ering amendments after it lias once been reported.
Attention has been sufliciently called, perhaps, to the importance of increasing
the duty on citrus fruits, but there are other interests in the State hardly 1-m im
portani to be loolced at. We, in common with other sections of the West, have large
interests in the wool industry, and our delegation in Congress snould be urged to
stand with the wool men in their efforts to obtain the full and completo protection
which they desire.
It is hardly worth while to go over again on this subject the old controversy
about free raw material. It is now well understood that what is the raw material of
one industry is the finished product of another. To the Eastern manufacturer low
duties on wool may be an advantage, but to the people of those States where sheep
herding is a great industry protection to wool is just as important as protection to
woolen goods.
We called attention yesterday to the fact tha^t brandies, wines of all kinds, sugar
and molasses have been placed by the Dingley bill in the list of articles on which the
President is authorized to reduce duti-.'s or remove them altogether in arranging
reciprocity treaties. This, therefore, is another phase of the subject to which Cali
fornia must eive consideration, and efforts should be made to so restrict that clause
as to prevent any possible reciprocity treaty which would expose the wine and sugar
industries of California to the competition of nations like France and Germany, which
produce those articles in large quantities for export.
The situation in brief is one which calls for immediate vigilance and activity.
Tho plan of having the tariff fully arranged in committee so as to assure it of a
majority of votes hefore it is reported to the Senate is so gooa in itself thr.t we hardly
need the authority of so many Washington correspondents to assure us of its adop
tion. It is, in fact, the beat possible way for making progress in this kind of legisla
tion. It is as fair for us as for the rest <f the Union, and imposes upon us no other
duty than that of presenting our claims at once while the bill is in committee, in
stead of waiting for it to come before the Senate, and then trying to amend it.
EXTENDING TRADE.
Now that the Chamber of Commerce
has undertaken the wort of organizing
the merchants and manufacturers of this
City ana of the State for the purpose of
developing and promoting trade with the
west coast of South America, it is to be
hoped they will not abindon the task
until successful results have been attained.
To do this it will be important to adopt
right methods at the beginning, and in de
ciding what methods to employ much can
be learned by Biudyinc the experience of
the merchants and manufacturers of the
East.
A recent circular of information issued
by the JNational Association of Manufac
turers, having its headquarters at Phila
delphia, gives the experience of a num
ber of practical business men in various
efforts to extend their foreign trade fn all
parts of the world. One of the statements
published is of particular importance, be
cause it oeals with methods which proved
successful, an! instead of describing what
is to be avoided in seeking foreign trade
goes directly to the point and sets iorth
what should be done.
The statement In question was made by
Albert Herbert of Boston, who says that
lor the last few year.-* one-third of the
entire force of his house has been working
on foreign trade and has accomplished
good results. His methods were these:
First, his house advertised iiberally In the
countries where they wished to sell
articles, and secondly, they s-ent over first
class American salesmen and established
offices in the piincipal cities. It was
found that foreign people responded just
as quickly to advertising as our own peo
ple, and that American salesmen were just
as successful abroad as at home where the
same methods were employed.
As Mr. Herbert says: "The way to reach
that trade over there is to advertise the
same thing that we advertise here, first
class advertising when it is required, and
back it up by first-class salesmen sent
from this side to start the fiing over
there." That me: hod has proved success
ful, and the results have been so good that
Mr. Herbert adds: "I think that In two
years from this time most ol our business
will be done in Europe."
There can be no question that business
methods are pretty much the same all the
world over and what ia good in one coun
try will prove good in another. The mer
chants and manufacturers of San Fran
cisco have only to apply to the South
American market the same energy which
they have used in builJing up the trade
at home to accomplish success. The first
cost of opening new markets and intro
ducing new goods will be large, and there
fore it will be well to have some sjrt of
organization that will permit of co-opera
tion to begin with, ft ought to be 6asy to
effect such an association, and certainly
the reward which may be expected in
South American trade is sufficiently large
to just.fy a considerable outlay to obtain
it. The movement is a good one and the
Chamber of Commerce should have tj^e
general support oi merchants and tnanu
lacturer s in advancing it as rapidly as
possible. .
THE BULGARIAN DEMANDS.
The demands made unon the Sultan of
Turkey by the Bulgarian Government are
the first evidence which has been given of
a possibility of that uprising against the
Ottoman empire on the part of the people
of the Balkan I'eninsuia upon which it is
evident the Greeks counted when they
ventured to defy all Europe and engage
in what seemed on the face of it to be a
rash and unequal war.
The demands, however, were no sooner
made by the Bulgarians than die Russian
Embassador at once intervened. He is
reported to have said to the Bulgarian
representative that the time is inoppor
tune to ask for reform. It is a pity he
could not have been photographed as he
said it. It requires something more than
the ordinary amount of diplomatic facility
in the use of language to assert that this
is not an opportune time to asK a reform
when the Bulgarians have been waiting
many years for just such an opportunity
to offer itself.
It remains to be seen whether the peo
ple of Macedonia and Montenegro will
follow the lead of Bulgaria. If they
should do so, Russia will require some
thing more tnan a diplomatist at Con
stantinople to maintain the Sultan and
preserve the Ottoman empire. The re
cent request of permission for the passage
of the Dardanelles by a Russinn fleet
seems to be significant of a knowledge on
the part of the Czar that the uprising of
all the Balkan States is a probability of
the near future. The danger of the out
break may be much greater than appears
from this distance and the steps taken br
the Turks and the Russians are ?n evi
dence that they regard it as a serious
menace.
While the Russian Government I as not
made publicly any othci.il statement of its
views upon the siluaiion, or its possible
action under any contingencies that may
arise, there huva been expressions in the
newspapers of St. PeterÂ»burg which afford
some evidence upon which to base a judg
ment of the Russian policy. The current
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 24, 1897.
number of the Literary Digest has a trans
lation of an editorial from tne JVovoye
I irhivn, which reviews thoroughly the
situation at Constantinople, and, after
pointing out the reasons why Russia
would not care to occupy that city either
by conquest, by consent of the Sultan, or
by consent of the powers, concludes by
saying: "Russia wants peace and the
maintenance of the status quo, and it is
an error to suppose that she is insincere
on account of her designs with reference
to Constantinople. But she wishes one
thing understoodâ that, in the event of
division, her claim to Constantinople is
superior to all other claims."
It may ho assumed, then, that the whole
power of Russia wiil be exerted to main
tain conditions as they ac, and that the
Balkan Mates and principalities will be
given due notice that if they attempt to
press for reforms at this time, they will
have Russia as well a? Turkey for a foe.
Here, at any rate, seems to be a policy
definitely adopted which will be resolutely
enforced. The outlook for Greece, there
fore, is not encouraging. Her friends In
England and France are wavering, while
the friends of Turkey are prepared to act
and act forcibly at ;he first emergency
that requires it.
SENATOR MORGAN'S CRUSADE.
The persistence of Senator Morgan in
nrging his Cuban resolution upon the
Senate is more like the action of
an agitator than that of a states
man. The Senator seems to have
made himself a doctrinaire, a man
oi one idea; and it has been questioned
even by the fr.ends ot Cuba whether his
incessant agitation and persistent speak
ing on the subject has not hurt the cause,
by making it irritating to tho Senate,
rather than advanced it.
The agitator is not welcome to any class
of people who nre either indifferent to his
cause or who, while interested in it, have
other objects to attain which they regard
as of more importance. The incessant
talker wears upon the patience of people,
and not infrequently forces those who
were kindly disposed at first to oppo-e
him simply from a sense of antaconisin
roused by too much persistence. To this
extent the course of Senator Morgan has
been hurtful to the Cuban cause. There
can be no question that he has made the
Senators weary of the subject and pre
vented many of them from speaking on it
simply because they believed the talk has
been overdone.
On the other hand, it must be remem
bered that nearly everything that has
been accomplished in thii world has been
the result of untiring persistence. The
men who continually peg away at a sub
ject and keep eternally at it are the men
who win in the lone run. Morgan may
weary the patience of his colle agues, but
he none the loss keeps them continually
thinking of Cuba and of tha duties which
! this Government owes to civilization and
humanity as well as to the independence
joi all American peoples. Iv this way ho
prevents the subject from being ignored
or overlooked, and makes every freÂ»h in
stance of Spanish tyranny or cruelty in
the inland a new occasion for appeals to
the Senate for immediate action on behalf
of the rights of the patriots.
In the long run the Senator is sure to
win his fight. Such persistence as he has
shown never completely fails of its object.
Over and over .-gain it has been shown
in parliamentary bodies that the man of
one idea is a lighting force equal to half a
dozen men whose energies are scattered in
various directions. The grim old Senator
is therefore rendering a nood service not
only to Cuba but to the United States as
well. We may all of us at times grow
weary of his talk and denire some cessa
tion of hi 3 persistent crusade, but on the
whole we know that his cause is right,
and sooner or later the Senate and the
House of Representatives will have to
adopt his policy and crown with complete
success the crusade in which he has so
vigorously en traced.

Letters From Our Readers on Topics of Current
Interest.
English Law " Points" on Legal Tender.
Lditor of the San Fravdsco Callâ Sir: It is now my purpose to give the "divers points"
of law which â¢â¢weie considered and resolved" or decided by "the chief judges (being the privy
council)" la the case ot -Mixed Money" in England under gocd Queen Bess in 1601, of which
I gave the decision of the court in a former paper, which "points" are good law in England
to-day, after the lapse of 2'Jb' years, and I think the reader will prefer the phraseology of the
privy council ol that day to any modern terms into which I might turn it. I present the
matter in the order in which I find it in the report made of the case by Sir John Davies.
"First, it was considered that In every commonwealth It Is necessary to have a certain
standard of money, ior no commonwealth can FUbsist without contracts, and no contracts
without equality, and no equality In contracts without money. For, although in the first
societies in the world permutation [exchange or barter] of one thing f< r another was used, yet
that was soon found cumbersome, aiid the transportation and division of things was found
difficult and impossible, and therefore money was invented, as well for the facility of com
merce as to reduce contracts to an equity.
"Secondly, it was resolved that it uppertaineth only to the King of England to make or
coin money within Ms dominions, so that no person can do it without special license or com
mandment of the Kinp, and it *ny person presume to do it of his own head, it is treason
aganst the person of the King by the common law, and this appears by the statutes of 25 Ed.
3 c. 2 (which is only a declaration of the common law).
"Tnirdly, it was resolved that as the King by his prerogative may make money of whatever
matter or form he plettteih, and establish the standard of it. so may he chance his money
in substance and impression, ana enhance or debase the value oi It, or entirely decry and
annul it, *o that it shall be but bullion, at his pleasure. And that the King hath used this
prerogative in England appears by several notorious changes of money, made in the times of
the several kings aince the Norman conquest.
"Fourthly, it was resolved that the said mixed money having ihe impression and the In
scription of the Queen of England, and being proclaimed for lawful and current money within
tho kingdom of Ireland, oucht to be taken and accepted for Merlins money ; and on considera
tion of this point, the name and nature of sterling money were inquired and discovered.
'â¢Fifthly, it was refolved that although this mixed money was made to be current within
this kingdom of Ireland only, yet It may well be said current and lawful money of England
for two Chusei: (1) Because this kinedom is only a member of the imperial crown of England,
and (2) It is called lawful money of England in respect to the place oi coinage, which was in
Edgland, viz: in the t< wer of London.
'â¢Sixthly, and lastly, it was resolved that although at the time of the contract and obliga
tion made in the present case (Gilbert against Brett) pure money of gold and silver was cur
rent within this kingdom wnere the place of pnyment was assigned (at the tomb of Earl
Strongblow in Christ Church, Dublin); yet the mixed money being established in this king
dom before the day of payment, may well be tendered in discharge of the taid obligation
and the obligee is bound to accept it; and if he refuses It and waits until the money be
changed again, the obligor is not bound to pay other money of better substance, but it is
sufficient it he be always ready to pny his mixed moneys according to the rate for which they
were current at ihe time of the tender.
"Ami as to the circumstance of the pay place, It was resolved that although the contract was
made in London, vet the place of judgment being appointed in Dublin, of "necessity the obli
gor must make his tender in the mixed money at the time of payment; for all other money
was cried down and made bullion by the proclamation aforesaid and this money only estali
lished; so that if the obligee had refused this mixed money he had committed a contempt, for
which he might be punished. Also the judges are not bound to take notice of any money that
is not current by proclamation."
These, then, are tne six points of law on which the chief judges of the highest court in
England based their famous decision in the "mixed money" case of Gilbert against Brett in
ICOI, which was to the effect "that the tender of Â£100 in mixed money, at the day and plHee
named in the contract, was good and sufficient in law, and that said Brett should not be
obliged at any time niter to pny other money in discharge of the debt than this mixed
money." at its current rate, which was Its lace value.
As the decision and tne points by which it is sustained remain to this day the law of Eng
land, a nation conceded l y all to be governed and inspired by high commercial and financial
honor, I commend to certain of my fellow-citizens who prate so much of Populistic repudia
tion a close study and mental assimilation of the English law laid down in the case just re
viewed of Gilbert against Brett in the hoie that they may clear their minds of bankers' cant
and learn how to use their reason when it is set free from >>(.>. l-degrading prejudice.
Of course it is hard for me to forego a littlecaustic comment on some of the solemn-visaged
dogmas of money-lenders, but honest readers of average intelligence need no spur to qnicken
thepHCe of heir wits when once they are in possession of the law and the facts concerning
this vital issue which we call the money question; and, in spite of prejudice and insidious
misinformation liberally dealt out to them, a constantly Increasing number of deluded citizens
are eetting their eyes open and beginning to see things for themselves.
Perhaps I ougnt not to close tnls communication without adding the single remark that
hr the mixed money was legal tender and performed all the functions of the former money in
ustj in that kingdom, but which had been demonetized by proclamation of the sovereign
Qu-en Bt-ss. there was no wrong dove Gilbert when lie wt9 paid in mixed money eince tbe
intrinsic value of the coins used cut no figure in discharging the debt. The debt was created
by law. and it was paid by law. The mixed monry nad tne same value in law as a debt-paving
acent that the lormer money possessed. The debt was paid and fuliy discharged, and Gilbert
\vÂ«Â« In luck that he escaped prosecution ior contempt ot the law.

A NEW METHOD OF WALKING.
A recent report made to the Academy of Sciences at Paris goes to show that the ordinary
manner of walking and running is far from being the best or the least fatiguing. This has
been more than suspected ior some time, but scientific proof has hitherto been lacking. The
efforts of raw recruits to acquire the "parade step" have always afforded endless amusement
to the cpectator. No doubt it adds greatly to the "smartness" of a body of soldiers on a re
view to see every one erect, each knee straightened and each foot striking the ground sharply,
but like many other things it seems that this has only custom aud tradition to recommend it
least of all utility.
The exhaustive experiments made in France by aid of the camera hare proved conclusively
that the natural and easiest mode of walking ana running is that which has been practiced
from time immemorial by our own Indians and by other half-civilixed tribes.
The new method of walking was devised in 1872 by & French officer, Commandant de
Raou'., and although It attracted but little attention at that time, the new experiments have
brought it forward prominently, and it will probably be soon adapted practically in the
French army. The characteristics of the pas de flexion, or "flexion step," are that the body is
Inclined forward and the knees bent. Tho ecu ter of gravity is thus always on the point of
being lost, and the only way to prevent fallirg is to keep in motion. The feet are raised only
far enough to avoid any inequalities lv the surface of the ground, and the trained walker or
runner glides along with the suppleness and agility of a cat TheSingalese and Japanese
runners, who cover gixty to seventy-five miles daily, month after month, the couriers and
postmen of India, all swing their limbs in exactly the same way.
In the ordinary mode of walking the energy absorbed in raising the body is considerable
The photograph shows that the range of rise and fall is nearly two inches, while in the "flex
ion step" it is less than one. In running a mile in the old way the wasted energy is equal to
a 250-foot climb, but by the new it amounts to an ascent of only about 100 feet. As in a bicy
cle energy is economized by preventing the useless vibration of its parts, so in the Raoul
method of walking fatigue is lessened by allowing the foot to strike the ground glancingly,
whereby the jars incident to the usual mode are avoided.
It is stated that in this way a man's endurance depends on the strength of his legs and he
is not "winded" quickly. The runner begins by waking very short, quick steps, IGO to the
minute. The length of the step is gradually lengthened. The results obtained in Franco ap
pear remarkable. The average man is able almost at the start to do the first mile in eight
minutes, the second in seven, third in six, and the sixth in fifteen seconds less. These recorc s
have been made over and over again. A well-trained man is able to cover his third mile
in five and a half minutes, and even when loaded down with the regulation arms and bag
gage he can easily make eight miles an hour.
The matter has received great attention in France, where everything is put to practical
use to Increase the efficiency of her army. If the Kaoul method is adopted in the French army
her solders will be able to march half again as fast as thoÂ«e of the enemy using the ordinary
step. Besides, what is of tqual importance, they will reach the point of close fighting in a
fresh condition and breathing easily. Many instances might be cited where soldier made a
forced march only to reach the battle-field in such an exhausted condition ts to be ot little
use in the fighting line.

BEEJStfAN'S SENTENCE
Judge 'Wallace AVaÂ« Kind to a Tungh

Nicholas Brennan, convicted of writing
a letter to extort money from the late
Theresa Tarpey, was yesterday sentenced
by Judge Wallacj to serve three years at
hard labor in the State prison at San |
Quentin. The prisoner's mother fainted i
in court when sentence was pronounced. ;
â  The circumstances attending the com- I
mission of Brennan's crime were unusual, j
and the letter itself on which the jury re
turned a verdict of conviction was so
brutal tnnt it was generally expected that !
the culprit would receive the full penalty
of the law, which would ba five yeaia.
For some unexplained reason the court
was lenient. This sentence means that by
strict obedience to prison rules Brennan
may Ret out of the State prison at the end
of two years.

FOOD COFFEE.
THREE TO ONE
And In the Right Direction.
It is not alone the wealthier classes who
are using Postum Cereal, the grain coffee,
instead of the old kind.
Working people have found, first, that
25c worth of Postum will go as far as 75c
worth of coffee, and that while it is not as
bitter as cheap coffee it has the deep rich
color of expensive Mocha and much the
same mellow taste. .
Postum is a food in liquid form, made at
Battle Creek, Mich., of pure grains, and
almost every old coffee drinker who has
some ailment of body will find in less than
ten days after leaving off berry coffee and
using Postnm Cereal, the health coffee, j
that in many cases the old (rouble will be
gone; in all cases there will be an im-
provement in health. There is a simple
and good reason for this, as. coffee is
known by physicians to carry a positive
percentage of poisonous alkaloids which
directly attack stomach, heart and liver
and from them to the nerves.
Beware of the fraudulent imitations of
the original Postum Cereal Grain coffee.

KNIGHTS TEMPLAR
AND LADIES
Brilliant Gathering at the
Drill in Mechanics' In
stitute Pavilion.
California CDmmandery Covered
With Glory Gallantly Won
by Its Drill Corps.
Oak and Lades .Assisted the Knights
in Making the P.ctnresquj
F. ature of the Affair.
Reminiscences of medieval history, of
courteous knights gayiy uppareled in
velvet and silken cloaks, doublet ana
hose ; of fair ladiesfor whose smiles 'twere
sweet to die, were awakened last night by
the exhibition drill and ball in Mechanics'
Pavilion by the Grand Commandery.
Knights Templar, of California, in aid of
the Masonic Widows' and Orphans' Home
fund.
The Pavilion, though over-roomy and
trying, except for the largest gathering,
! was just comfortable, every chair on the
ground floor having been sold, and it was
none too roomy for the Knights, who gave
the finest exhibition drill ever witnessed
| in this City, and at the same time the
; most closely contested.
The ladies in large numbers graced the
occasion, arrayed in their most winsome
summer toilettes. Beauty beamed and
i smiled upon the Sir Knights Irom under
1 roses, carnations, violets, camelias and
j peonies, and brightened the auditorium
j with brilliant colors of pink and mauve
j and crimson and turquoise and cold in {
suisse and lace and sh immering silks.
First in order on the programme and I
first in merit came the drill corps of Cali
; fornia Commander}' No. 1, commanded
I by Sir Reuben P. Hurlbut, assisted by
Senior Warden Sir James A. Christie find
Sir William tl. F. Ty;us, junior warden.
The corps' uniform was "smart" and
neat. The white waistbelt and tne sboul
der-bslt and the white-banded skull cap
formed conspicuous lines to show any
j breaks or irregularities in the formation
j or the march and made the drill all the
| more trying, for, should a member of the
| corps get out of line, be it ever so slightly, j
the white belts and the cap band would j
show the gap at once.
Commander Hurlbut handled his men
j with the ease of a veteran of the regular ';
army and kept them at work without a i
break. The twenty-four ceased to be men â 
I and became automatons, moving like i
parts of a machine. They formed crosses, I
\ triangles, squares and circles and wheeled â 
j and countermarched and swung into line >
i so easily and so gracefully, and kept their :
j distances so well that" the spectators' j
| palms were red with clapping, while the j
floor quivered with applauding feet and
the thumping of walking flicks.
The general criticism was that the drill
| could not have- been done better by any |
j corps in or outside of the State, and Com- j
mander Hurlbut was congratulated on all i
sides for the excellent results of his train
ing.
Oakland Commandery No. 11 followed,
mingling female loveliness and feminine j

: knight errant. Upon the arm of each Sir |
! Knight bung a lady in summer costume, !
â  ai:d those costumes were so varied that ',
J when the calcium lights played upon them |
! they resembled a procession of flowers.
Not handicapped, but aided by - the j
j "fayre ladyes," the knights went through i
j all the difficult evolutions of the fancy I
i drill, forming stars, crosses, squares, tri- {
i angles and circles, that expanded and |
| contracted as the march went on. It was |
the really pretty feature of the occasion, \
and the spectators were more than liberal i
with their applause. S:r Alfred W. Bur- |
rell was the commandant, and he did j
well. â  -
The drill corps of Golden Gate Com- â 
mandery No. 16 followed with a splendid |
exhibition of drilling, the corps being par
ticularly precise in coming to a halt and
marching with a lull front. The corps
will find few equals outside of this State,
and to Sir William Edwards, the captain,
belongs the praise for the excellent dis
cipline and thoroughness of instruction
: that were evidenced last night in the
j work ol the corps.
The drill closed with the appearance of
the corps as a battp.lion. Right Eminent

I in the grand march, but its drill corps

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 24, 1897.
The Little Gasoline Steamer Two Bits, WiÂ± Seme Transfer Solcitoil Aboard, Getting Business
From the City of Peking Last Sunday by Means of the Megaphone.
A NEW USE FOR
THE MEGAPHONE
Transfer Men Use It to
Solicit Orders From
Steamers.
Brought to Bear on the City o!
Peking Last Sunday With
Gcod Effect.
Thirty Japanese Detained on the
UmaUl'a by the Immigration
Commissioner.
Competition makes trade, and the fight
among the transfer men seems to grow
instead of diminishing. The Pacific Trans
fer Company seems to hold the whip
hand, but it bos to work hard in order to
maintain its position. It brought the
Morton Transfer Company to term?, but
no sooner had it killed off that opposition
than np Â«prang the Commercial Transfer
Company. The latter concern went vig
orously into the business, and soon had a
larce clientage. KatÂ«s were plashed right
and left, and then t:.e Pacific people suc
ceeded in barring all the opposition's run
ners from incoming steamers and sailing
vessels. Not to be beaten, the Commercial
people purchased a gasoline launch and
megaphone. They started in with their
new scheme last Sunday, when the City
of Peking was passing up the bay. One of
the men handled the launch, and "Sam"
Wells used the megaphone to Buch good
effect thnt he s-ecu ret; at least two-thirds
of the baggape that came on the steamer.
The littlo boat goes away out to sea, and
she is more than a surprise to incoming
ships when the passengers hear a plainly
spoken request for the right to handle
their baggsge coming outof space.
The managers of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Compnny are in a qunndary as
to what to do with thirty Japanese tfcey
have on their hands. The steamer I'ma
tilla is sc; eduled to sail next Monday,
and as Commissioner of Immigration
Stradley will not land them the chances
are they will have to be kept on Angel
Inland at the expense of the company.
The Commissioner refuses to givo away
his hand, but asserts that he has discov
ered some new points, which have been
submitted to the Treasury Department.
j Should his contention be upheld it means
The Friend of the Far Distant Fur Sea's.
Charles S. Hamlin, Advisory Agent of the State Department for the seal fisheries,
and Assistant Secretary of the Treesury under the recent Cleveland administration,
will arrive at the i'aiace to-night from Washington, D. C.
He is on his way to Bering Sea and the Seal Islands to make an examination into
the condition of the aeals and as is understood to confer with representatives of the
British Commission in regard to details for the better protection of the seals.
A special dispatch from Washington published yesterday "aid Professor David
Starr Jordan had been selected to go to the Seal Islands and make a report on the
present condition of the seal 3 ar.d that Mr. Hamlin .would probably go with Mm.
Professor Jordan was at the Occidental yesterday and said when the matter was
called to his attention:
â¢'lt is incorrect that lam eoiag. I saw the dispatch, but I have not been selected,
and in fact there is no need of mv eoing nor anybody with the exception of probably
one person from the United States Government to count the seals at one or more of
the test stations that have been established.
"All the facts have been Rained regarding the seals that are necessary at present,
except to ascertain whether the seals are decreasing or holding their own. The per
centage one way or the other maybe obtained by counting the seals at the test
stations ami comparing the result with figures formerly obtained.
"Mr. Hamlin, formerly Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, would ba an excel
lent man to go up there and take final observations. He has bÂ«en there and he is
now on his way here. He has telegraphed me from Denver saying he wonld arrive
here Fatnrday night and has rW:M me 10 me-t him here, which I will do. Mr. Ham
lin is a bright man and well informed regarding the seals. I shall confer with him
but aa I said i am not myseif going with him."
i that at least nine-tenths of the Japanese
now coming to this country will be de
barred. Thia means that an effort is be
in? made to send the Hawaiian oversup
p'y back to Japan instead of allowing
them to come to the United States via
British Columbia.
A strange feature ol ihe prÂ«?ent case is
tuat all the Japanese on the Urnatilla
were passed by the United Btates Com
mlssioner of Immigration at Vancouver,
B. CL Stradley, however, has overruled
his recniuruen lations in the case of these
thirty men whom he refuses a landing
' until he bean from the Treasury Depart
ment. It is rumored that Commissioner
Stradley ha" evidence that nearly all the
Japanese coming here are contract
laborers.
Captain Friis, late matter of the Con
suelo. has bear appointed master of the
bark Martha Ihivis, vice Captain Soule.
Ttie latter will return to Honolulu by
steamer, go into business on nis own ac
count, miirry a handsome island be;le and
settle down.

have already been desiccated and put on
the market. Cocoanitta and a few bales of
cottoi was all the Papeete brought to
San Francisco.
Dominic KoDarts, the well-known water
front commission man, has two very sore
ringers. Yesterday he had two little Dut
cinnamon bmnt cubs, la-<t night he had
none. One of them nearly chewed the in
dex linger of his right hand off, and
Dominic is now nursing the wounded
digit. A pet chickpnhawk nearly tore the
nail from the thumb of his left hand, and
that member is also in mourning. The
young bears were sold to a butcher ana |
the pet hawk is chained inside a wire j
cage, where ne cannot bestow any favors
on his friend?. Three times s> day Domi
nic looks at his sore lingers, shake* his
head and murmurs, "No more pets for
me."
Emul A. Leydecker, a barkeeper for
Henry Prague on the water front, was ar
rested yesterday on a charge of embezzle
ment and locked up in the Harbor Ponce
station yesterday. It appears that a
rancher named Michael Dillon came to
town last Tuesday and in the evening vis
ited "Henry's" place. He displayed over
$200 in cash when the many steam beers
he nad drunk got the belter of him, and
thon Leydecker tried to get him upstairs
to btd. After a long altercation Dillon
did go to bed and in the morning his
money was gone. He asserts that Ley
decker embezzled the money.

JIMMY ANTHONY
WAS OUTCLASSED
Barry, the Champion Ban
tam, Won a Well-Mer
ited Decision.
Twenty Rounds of Scientific
Fighting in Woodward's
Pavilion.
Armstrong Whipped Pruit in a
Pnncb, and Rubenstein De
feated Ct ovy.
"Good laws me, Mr. Armstrong, don't
hit me any more. I'se stopped now."
This is what Sam Pruit, a big, husky,
colored man said to Bob Armstrong, his
opponent, last evening at Woodward'B
Pavilion alter he had received a few left
hand jabs in the mouth.
It was the last event on the National
Club's programme, and it ended in a dis
mal failure.
Pruit ana Armstrong were to have had
a ten-round bout, tut Pruit was not a
"dead game" pu?, and he quit earl} in
the game.
The first event was a four-round contest
between Ike Rutvnstein of Sacramento
and Jce Cooney of Chicago. Referee Cook
gave a decision in favor of Rubenstein,
and the announcement was received with
hoots and catcalls. Rubenstein had cer
tainly the belter of the first two rounds,
but in the last rounds of the fight Cooney
scored a strong lead and had bis opponent
on "'queer street" when the contest fin
ished. Rubenstein diJ not b7 any means
prove tliat he was a game tighter, as he
withered in the last part of tbe game and
looked beseechingly at his seconds, as if
he wanted them to vhrow up the sponge.
The event of the evening was a2O-round
contest between Jimmy Anthony of Aus
j iralia and Jimmy Barry, the champion
1 bantam of this country. The lighters,
whoscaled in at 115 i ounds, could nothave
been in better trim for a long race. The
betting was strongly in favor of Barry,
who sold for $10 as against $6 on Anthony.
The contest was not for the champion
ship of the two countries as many people
supposed, as championship battles are to
a nuish only. Tue tight was very in
teresting because of the science and* gen
eralship displayed by the contestants.
Anthony was the aggressor frcmstart to
finish, but he was outclassed bya m ore
c'ever man, who, by cunning moves and
pretty arm work, drew the Australian's
fire, which spent itself on theatmosphere.
Anthony tried time and again to get
within close range of hisgame, but instead
of sending out straight left leads, he swung
at Barry's bead or body and fell short
almost invariably only to receive a clip
under the ear or a straight left on the
eye, which medicine, however, was taken
by Anthony wiih apparent relish.
The rounds were pretty much the same
up to witnin the last six or seven, when
Anthony, finding that he <vas outpointed
in f-tralght-bitting and ducking, made
some desperate attempts to land aright
swing or left hoot on some vulnerable
spot. Barry was carelul not to mix too
often with his powerful opponent, nntici
p--.tiiitr that a chance blow might send him
to dreamland.
However, when the little fellows did
get to clo^e quarters and an exchanpe ot
compliments resulted, tne American
champion proved to the satiÂ«faction of the
referee and spectators that he was pretty
good nt a mixture himself, as lie landed
at least two blows to the one he received.
Anthony's stopping was very clever, but
each time he essayed to land a right hook
or attempted to cross his opponent, he fell
short and clinched tc avo.d 3 return.
There weiv many opportunities which
he missed taking advantage of for a good
stiff nppercut and as a consequence no
lost what might have resulted in a victory
to him. The Australian's leads were gen
erally short. He calculated distance
badly and several times he left openings
a.ter missing wild swings which Harry
should have taken advantage of, but the
American wus not there to take a chance
of being knocted out.
Barry's figurine on distance win excel
lent, and when it came to in-fighting he
proved himself tho master of the man
who was supposed to be a crackerjaet at
th it game.
Neither man was punished to any ex
tent, as the contest was a clever exhibi
tion of good sparring instead of slogging,
which the spectators are more accus

MONKEYED WITH MAIL.
That In Why Young Richard Blorae
Is Now Confined in
Jail.
Richard Morse, a ! 17-year-old boy, was
brought up from Los Angeles Thursday
by Deputy United States Marshal Covar
rubias and placed in the custody of United j
States Marshal Baldwin, who will hold i
him for indictment and trial for forging !
the indorsement of Fred W. Appleby on a '
postal-note.
Morse was acquainted with Appleby,
and hearing that / ppleby's father in tlie
East was about to send him ?ome money j
went to the Oakland Poatoflice and got
Appleby's mail.
In the letter was a postal money-order, !
payable to young Appleby. Mor^e wrote 1
his friend's name on the back of the order
and collected the money. Then he left |
that part of the State and mado his living
by peddling through the country.
After having escaped the officers for five |
months he was finally caught in Los An- !
geles. â¢
lie was examined before toe United ;
States Court Commissioner of that place!
and was held for trial, but not having j
been indicted his case will be laid before '
tne United States Grand Jury to-day and !
an indictment will be found against him. i
When arrested in Los Angeles, and !
afterward at the examination he con
fessed bis crime, and apologized for it by
saying that at that lime lie was out of
employment and out of money and the ;
temptation overcame him. The prisoner j
Dad borne n good reputation, this being
his first arresr, and had always been an
industrious youtu. He was employed for
two years In the nail works in Oakland.
"Ttie money has been returned to Ap
pleby," said Morse to a Call reporter
yesterday, "but I don't think that will
help the matter. It is the first time ii
ever violated the law, and it has taught I
; me a good lesson." .

they will ail be there, the attached riders
anyway. Entries close Monday, the 26; h.
At its annual meeting held last Monday
evening the Imperial Cycling Club elected
the following officers:
President, T. J. Winslow; vice-president, W.
Mncfarlane; secretary, George Ward; treas
urer, Godfrey Kd wards. The>e, with the addi

G. E. Tooker, J. K. Burns and J. S. Gang, will
con-i-.itute :he board of directors. The road
officers are: E. F. Flinn, captain ; \V. L. Wilson,
first lieutenant; K. F. Snydei, second lieu
tenant.
Cantain Trolliet will take the Imperials
on their last club run under the old road
officers to-morrow to Camp Taylor, taking
the 9a. M. Tiburon ferry. The Imperials
have secured training quarters at the
Velodrome . and will hare a number of
men entered for the meet on May 2.
Robert M. Welch, chairman of the C.
A. C. C. track-racing board, is in Los An
geles on a business trip, and while there
will take the pulse of the wheelmen of
that part of the State on Sunday racing.
It is understood that a team of profes
sionals will come up from Los Angeles to
take part in the Velodrome races.
The members of the San Francisco Road
Club under Captain J. S. Lewis will have
a run on Sunday to Haywards to witness
the road race of the Golden Gate Cycling
Club. The run w:ll leave the clubhouse
at 8:30 o'clock and the 9 o'clock boat will
be taken.
Ralph Robinson and Charles Goodwin
have been training very earnestly for the
Velodrome meet on May 2. A number of
other entries are looked for from among
the members, and the club hopes to make
a good showing and win its share of tne
prizes at the first sanctioned Sunday race
meet of the California Associated Cycling
Clubs.
The entertainment committee has de
cided to hold the smoker on Saturday
evening, May 1, at the clubhouse. They
have a large list of talent, and they assure
the members that they will have a jolly
good time.
I 1 rank H. Kerrigan, who recently re
signed from the chief consulship of the
league in this division, is paid a pretiy
compliment in the is -ue of the American
Wheelman of April 8, when, commenting
on his resignation, this paper, always a
strong advocate of Potter and his ideas,
says editorially:
His act shows the characteristic earnestness
of the West, that stern intention to accom
plish an object in spite of any and all oppo
sition. That he has resigned also reveals the
fact that he intends to be strictly str Âg.i nor
w&rd and honest in all his actions. Had he so
desired he might have retained his ciilicial
connection with the organization and worked
untold injury to it in his own and neighbor
ing States. It would have been a base Of oper
ticns and a source oi imormation ot great
value, ijui he has shown his manliness by
coming forward and tequesting that tie be re
lieved from further allegiance to the league.
For that lie is to be commended; he deserves
the encomiums of his former colleagues for
b"in>j brave enough to state his position and
to adnere to it to the las;; not because hou
esiy is no scarce that it should be patted on
Ute bact when we come in contact with it, but
because the temptation was great and he has
resisted it without flinching. No matter what
t:ov. is taken ot the alleged Recension move
ment, we must all admit that organized
Cycling nas lost the services oi a good man.
At its regular meeting next Monday
night, the California Cycling Club will
elect a board of directors under its new
by-laws. An athletic entertainment will
be held at tlie clubrooms this eveuing.
I see that another Slate racing circuit
iÂ» contemplated to visit interior towns.
Th"se undertakings are never financial
i-uccesses, and the wonder is they are
started so often. The last one only used
one oi a half-dozen dates arranged. Tne
Coulter-Jones match, mentioned exclu
sively in The Call a week ago, is dished
up as the piece de resistance of this uew
circuit.
The Golden Gate Cycling Cluo will hold
a five-m;le road race over the Ban Lean
dro-Haywards course to-morrow morning
at 11 o'clock. The following are the start*
ers: W. J. Black, Robeit Black, H.Wolp
man, Al Brill, F. Carroll, C. E. Unfred, G.
A. Bmittiurst, V. J. Fell, G. A. Hoertkorn,
J. Byrnes, T. Dwyer, C. H. Parks, J. Ches
ney, Charles Leib, J. McClo.tky, J. Mcln
tyre, J. Holle. Harry Knell, H. Sadek, G.
Hale and F. Arnold.
There is to be a match race at five miles
to-morrow at 1 o'clock, aiarting on the
county road in Pan Mateo County and
finishing at M nlo Park, between Al
John, Dan Iforphr, William Casey and
Rodney Tavlor. It will probably be one
of the hardest-fought races ever held in
ban Mateo County. Johnson if champion
of the county at present, an.t together
with Mnrpby is a member of the Garden
City Cyclers of San Jose. Taylor and
Casey are both members of the California
Cycling Club, and are both known as
speedy men in road events. Taylor was
the champion of the county in 1895-96.
Tijere is considerable interest manifested
in tne eyent at the two clubs mentioned.
Herman D. Hadenfeldt, recently elected
captain of the Olympic Club Wheelmen,
has been a prominent tigure in local
cycling circles for many years past. Ke is
a hardy road-rider and all-round athlete,
and has gained fame also as Â° timer of
road and track event-, being a member of
the C. A. C. C. board of official timers. His
unanimous election to the captaincy of
the Dig Post-street cycling club was but a
proper evidence of appreciation ol nis
valuable aid at all times cheerfuily given
to the sporr.
Thi> crew of the United States revenue
cutter Corwin, since their arrival at San
Dieyo, have developed the bicycle crr.ze
and they have a reputation for smashing
bicycles which is unparalleled. One man
broKe three wheels in three hours, whicu
is not bad for an amateur. Another ran
down a wagon ana a. so the drum-player
of ihe Salvation Army and another tried
to move an unoffending lamp post, which
be imagined was in his way. These are
only a few of the incidents which occur
daily among tbs Corwin boys. There are
no racers among them, bui they guar
antee if they cannot break records they
can at lear-t break wiieels. The Corwin
will shortly leave the southern port and
when she does tne proprietors of the bi
cycle-shops will heave a Â»igh of relief.
I would like to see more liands talce
hold of the work of building up the mem
bership of tne California Associated Cy
clintr Clubs, which has taken up the work
formerly done by the League of American
Wheelmen in this State. While the mem
oership is erowine very rapidly, it should
in reality be a sort of a boom. Remem
ber, ihere is no initiation fee up to May 1.
After that date it will be $1. Here's a
chance to make $1 pretty easily. Send \o
Tue Call cycling department for applica

THE ANGLER.
F:sh Commissioner Vogelsang's Ex
perlencs on Calaveras Crack.
The angling season is now well under
way and the large streams should soon be
in splendid order for a good whipping.
Al Cumming and John Gallagher, tno
champion fisherman of Oakland, are hay
ing good sport in the Klamath, near Atrer.
Mr. Gallagher writes that the fish are being
killed in a most unsportsmanlike manner
by people who will not respect the law. He
says that only flying fish can ascend
tne fish ladder and that wire traps are
constructed in the vicinity of the ladder
by professional fishermen who ship their
catches to Sacramen to and San Francisco.
Mr. Gallagher will try his luck in Shovel
Creek in a few days and he expects to cap
ture a number of Eastern trout which
were planted near the headquarters oi the
creek about four years ago.
Last Saturday Judge Hunt and Alex
ander Vogelsang, the Fish Commissioner,
whipped the Calaveras Creek with rather
poor results, as the water is yet too high
and consequents the trout are not very
hungry. Mr. Vogelsang happened to
stray away from the Judge during the
day, and on his return to camp the Judge
noticed a rather strange look in the lace
of the man who loves aa outing by the
brooK.
"What is the matter, Al, my dear fel
low?" asked the Judge, rather sym
pathetically, knowing that something bad
gone wrong with his young and hand
some companion.
"Well, Judge, I'll tell you all about it,"
answered the Fish Commissioner, in his
open and above-water way. "I cannot
hold a good thing too long, you know,
Judge, and here goes with the story."
"I'm all attention, Vogey," replied the
Judge, as be turned his weather ear within
bearing distance of tue Commissioner's
piscatorial bazoo.
"Just as I had quit fishing I met four
fellows who were on the homeward tack.
They said that they resided in San Jose.
Very well.
" 'How did you make it, boys,' I asked,
not forgetting, oi course, to put on my
usual best-I-know-how smile.
"The big fellow oi the party sized me
vp â you know in the way country fellows
generally do â and then shouted, 'Didn't
do a tning!'
"Well, when the fellow got to talking 1
thought it was all day with me.
" 'Look here,' said he, 'are you from
'Frisco?'
"I answered in the affirmative, of
course, and you could not guess what fol
lowed. Listen clo-.ely.
" 'If you will be kind enoush,' he con
tinued, 'to pay a visit to them 'ere Fish
Commissioners and aak them to get a
move on up this way when the breeding
season is on, there will be some fish left
for the anglers when the angling season
opens.'
"He had finished giving me particulars
concerning the amount of poaching that
was done in the winter months, when I
startled Him with the information that
he was addressing a Fish Commissioner.
"We had quite a pleasant chat, by the
way, and after I had explained to him
how we were cramped for money he made
allowance for the Fisn Commission and
threw the burden of blame on the game
warden of the county.
"But wasn't it a novel experience,
Judge?
"And of coarse, what could I do in the
premises but acquiesce and have Vogey
promise that he will take an interest in
tne breeding lisi.es of the beautiful
Calaveras next season."
First-ciass trout fishing is reported from
the headwaters of the Geysers. The
tributaries of the Pluton are furnishing
grand sport to anglers.
The following card from Horace Smyth,
secretary of tne Fly Casting Club, is sell
explanaiory:
Ban Francisco, April 20, 1897.
Dear Sir: You will please take notice that
on Tuesday evening, Aoril 27, at 8:30 o'clock,
Dr. Charles H. Gilbert will deliver his lecture
on "FresbWater Fish of California," nl tne
rooms ot the State Board of Fish Commission
ers, No. 78. Flood building. A prompt and
full attendance of members is requested.
Horace Smyth, Secretary.
BOXING.
Clubs Will In Future Provide a
Covering for the Rlnsr
Floor.
It was rather rough on the club recently
organized at San Jose that its first enter
tainment should nave such a sad ending.
It is not the first time in the history of
the ring, however, that death followed a
blow which, although not severe, had
force sufficient in it to send the recipient
in a state of unconsciousness on the flat of
his back, there to {remain until counted
out for all time.
In some of the examinations which have
followed the sad termination of a fistic
contest physicians have testified that the
effect of the blow was not so much the
cause of death as the effect of the fall
which followed what is generally termed
the knock-out blow.
The s&ull of 6ome men is very thin,
consequently a slight tap may cause con
cussion of the brain. It can, therefore, be
seen that when a fighter falls on a hard
and bare floor whtn in a state of coma aad

his skull comes in contact with a substance
that is not even pliable, tne result must
necessarily be severe.
Time and again the managers of boxing
clubs have been a-ked to place a covering
over the boards of a ring; but because of
neglect or because of the small expense
that may be attached to this by no means
difficult undertaking they (the managers
of clubs) have been personally responsible
for accidents that may have resulted from
a knockout blow. It is, however, not too
late for the officers of locai boxing organi
zations to taKe cognizance of this fact
and emulate thÂ« old California Club and
the present National Club in this respect.
The Olympic Club of this City has a
very good card for May 18, and, unless
something unforeseen should happen
to cause a postponement, the sport-lovers
will be treated to a f rst-class fistic enter
tainment next month. GanÂ» and Leonard
are expected to arrive to-day, an j after
they nave had a few lessons from Super
intendent Kennedy they will report to
their respective training stations.
Joe Gans and his old-time manager, Al
Herford, have had a falling out. and ac
cording to a Baltimore paper Her
ford says that he will prevent Gans
froir fighting before the Olympic Club,
but Sir William Kennedy says that there
is nothing that can stop Gans from doing
buttle, and that the mill will positively
take place.
N. Aronson of the Manhattan Club chsl
!euges young Sharkey to box him ten
rounds before any club.
Hiram Cook refereed the followine con
tests at the old California Athletic CUib
dating from May. 1888. to December, 1890.

According to "Fatty Blodes," the re
tired heavy-weight champion newsboy,
the sports of the Manhattan Athletic
Club lost a nice slice of gold by bet
tin*; on their iavorite tighter, Fred Muller,
who lost on a foul to Charley Rochette, at
the club's entertainment last Saturday
evening.
Biodes gave a rather humorous descrip
tion of the affair, which, he Hays, termi
nated in favor of the boys who were not
in the swim whan the arrangements were
perfected. "You see," said Blodes, "we
did them. The Manhattan sports had
every tuine cut and dry and they felt as
fine as silk until the referee was c&anged
on them.
"I'll tell you how we did them.
"You/ see, they went down to the pool
rooms on the night of the bgbt and
played Muller strong. They ran the
olds down from even money to $10 to $7,
with Muller on the long end. Well, you
know that was raw work, and the boyÃ
wno were playing Rochette tumbled right
away that something was daft.
"Well, I went out with some of the
Rochette people and we found out that
tne Manhattan referee, Killeen, was sweet
on Muller and that was enough for us.
We then knew that Rochette was in for it.
Well, got down to scheming and not
a word wns said by any of us until it was
time ior Rocneite to L-et in and scrap.
"Then we kicked like staers ogainst the
club's referee and told the Manhattan
people mat unless the reieree was
changed that Rochette would not go on
with the mill.
"We were satisfied to take any old
referee so long as Killeen wouldn't act.
See?
"Well, during tbÂ« racket over the objec
tir.n to the referee I swiped tne mitts, and
then there was a hi^h old time. I did
that trick so as to give us time to select
some one of the push I knew would be
goo*! to us in case, you know, something
would turn up that might go against us.
"Well, alter a whole lot ol argument
and this and that, we all agreed on Gus
Herget to referee the 'co, ' and you know
the result. Mulier fouled Rochette sev
eral times, and in the ninth round the
referee gave the contest to Rochette on a
roost palpable fonl. Of course the Muller
people lost their stuff, but they will know
better tbe next time if they will take my
advice."
THE OARSMAN.
The South Ends Will Hold a Regatta
Next Month.
The South End Rowine Club will hold a
grand club regatta on the Long Bridge
course on Sunday, May 9, and every effort
will be made to make it the greatest club
regatta of the season.
In the four-oared har^e races three crews
will enter in each class, viz. : Senior, inter
mediate and junior.
Captain McArthur of tne old senior
crew, familiarly known as the "Midgets,"
sent a formal challenge to Ed Scully on
last Sunday morning. Mr. Scully, on be
half of the new senior crew, accepted the
challenge, and it was agreed to row for a
French dinner on Sunday morning, May
9. This will be the star event of the day,
as great rivalry exists between these crews
and both are anxious to row the Stockton
Giants in the championship regatta.
The junior barge race also promises to
be an interesting one. Three crews will
be organized for this event under the
management of George Fox, Herbert
Hawfcint and T. I. Fitzpatrick. These
crews will commence training immedi
ately.
In the senior skiff race an attempt will
be made to bring together Frank Duphs
sea, Will McCausland and Dr. Dennis.
In the junior skiff race there are so
many entries that it will be necessary to
row in heats. The following gentlemen
have already entered: Jim Foiey, Matt
Breen, James Pallas, Frank Burke, Al
Fritz, Archie Campbell, Charles Cutter
and James Feehan.
Ous Carson, the afterwaist of the seniar
crew, is wanted at the South End boat
house.
The Sonth Ends' picnio on May 2 to
Bohemia Grove promises to be a grand
success.
The Dolphins will hold their annual
picnic at Bohemia Grove to-morrow.
Great preparations have been made, and
the outing is bound to be a great success.
THE YACHTSMAN.
The Corinthians Will Hold Their
Opening To- Day.
The Corinthians will take their turn and
open their season to-day. The committee
has issued the following announcement:
Corinthians : On Saturday, April 24, we will
welcome our season o{ '97 with the customary
Corinthian festivities. The clubhouse will ba
opened early for the reception of our lady
friends and their escort*. Refreshments will
be served during the afternoon, and the time
passed with music and dancing until the de
parureofour guests on the boat leaving at
5 :40 P. M Owners are requested to have their
yachts dressed for the occasion. Those unable
to attend to this personally may leave their
llags with the steward, who will set them.
As a prelude to the "jinks" a feast will be
provided immediately after the arrival of the
6:30 p. M. boat from the City. An elaborate
programme has been prepared for the evening
by a committee which has never lailed to
please the fastidious Corinthian. Owing to
the limited accommodation of our clubhouse,
this entertainment will be only for members
and specially invited guests. For the occasion
the. San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad
Company has kindly Consented to accommo
date those who are obliged to return to the
City. The boat will leave Tiburon about mid
night. Regular tickets will be accepted on
this boat. Three whistles will be blown as a
signal live minutes beiorc starting.
The sailing orders for the following day
are:
Orders, Sunday, April 25â8 A. X., colors;

The has been chosen by the Co
rinthian Yacht Club to compete for the
San Francisco challenge cup now neld by
the Eucinals.
A formal challenge was sent to the En
cinali a few days ago and the probability
is that the latter club will accept. It ia
expected that the Fawn will be chosen,
and as both yachts are in the same class a
great rnoe should be the result.
The .El us is owned by genial Bob
Morrow and Vice-Commodore Westerfeld.
S c was designed by Leonard ana bailt by
Frank Stone.
The A', mis has shown great speed, and
in the last regatta made an excellent
showing against ex-Commodore Pew's
yacht Truant.
J. It. Savory's yacht Juanita is on the
beach having her bottom painted and in
terior renovated and will go in commis
sion to-morrow.
CRICKET CHIRPS.
How the Historic Game Has Taken
Root In California.
Now that the cricket season of 1897 is
weli under way a chirp or two regarding
the growth of the game locally seems to
be in order.
It is now over thirty years since the
game was regularly established in Cali
fornia by the formation of the old Pacific
and the Occident clubs, which in the early
sixties Bent a team to British Columbia.
Some years later whe San Francisco Club
came into existence, and in 1879 the boys
of Trinity and the Boys' High School
formed a junior cluÂ§, playing ac the Pre
sidio. In the following year the well
known Merion Club. uiuler the able presi
dency of William Greer Harrison, ap
peared on the held, and for tnree years
competed zealously with the Occident an<l
the then existing interior clubs of Grass
Valley and Nevadn City.
From lSÂ»2to ISBS there wa* a hiatus in
local cricketuom, brought about chiefly by
the breaking up of the Aierions, but in the
iatter year a great revival took place, no
le*s ttian four ciubs, the Pacific, Burnaby,
Oakland nnd AiameJa springing up, to
say nothing of several country clubs, in
ridding Lake County, San Jose, Penryn,
Bukersfie.d, Hanford, Santa Cruz, Los
Angelas. R:verside and Mill Valley.
In 1&90 the California Cricket Associa
tion was formed for the purpose of gener
ally directing cricket affairs in California
and since then the game has steadily
grown in public favor. The Burnaty and
Oakland clut>Â« were short lived, hut their
places were taken by the Bohemian and
Caliiornian cubs whicli, with the Pacific
and Alameda combinations, seem to have
come to stay.
Every bunday and holiday during the
season interclub matches for a challenge
cup are playedâ one at Webster ttreet,
Alameda; ihe other Â»t Golden Gate â and
matches against the country clubs will
take place from time to time?
The match last year against the world
famed Australian eleven, while resulting,
as was inevitable, adversely for the local
players, did much toward bringing the
game before the public, and the effect is
already s. en in the increased attendance
of spectators on the grounds.
An excellent cricket song has just been
issued hy the musical and poetic talent of
the Harrow (England) School. It has a
rattling chorus and begins thus:
Willow the King is a monarch grand;
Tnree in a row his courtiers stand;
Every day when the sun shines bright
The doors 01 his palace are paintea white,
And all toe company bow their backs
To ihe King with the collar of cobbler's wax.
So hoi so ho! dqht tne courtiers sing
Honor and Hie to" Willow the Kingl
The games scheduled for to-morrow are:
At Alnmeda, Pacifies vs. Caiifornias; at

Basket- Ball.
A game of unusual interest was played
last Thursday evening at ibe Y. M. C. A.
Gymnasium between the Rushers of San
Francisco and the Cyclones of Oakland.
The Rushers felt like calling it bad luck
when the ball was on the road to the bot
tom of their basket, but roiled around the
rim to drop outside. And it happened so
often! Tie Cyclones of Oakland showed
excellent team work and did some beauti
ful goal throwing, which accounts lor the
score of 13 to 3 in their favor.

Sacramento Sporting News.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 22.â The main
topic of interest among the local sporting
men at present is the boxing contests that
will take place before the Sacramento Athletic
Club on the evening of the 29th inst., when
Harry Woods of San Francisco and James J.
Ryan of New York, welter weights, will give a
ten-round contest, and Tom Cooney of Boston
will maet P. Daly of San Francisco in a ten
round go.
The 100-mlle road race between the Capital
and Terminal City Wheelmen will take
place next Sunday. It is claimed that Stock
ton will have three teams entered and that
they will put up a great fight for the trophy.
Some unprincipled joker rushed into the
Golden Eagie Hotel this week and inlormed
Galey Graham, "Secto crack trout fisher," that
there was a great run of salmon trout in the
river and that they bad entered the overflow
and were taking the fly in good shape. The
news proved to be too great a temptation for
Galey. He took an afternoon off, and mount
ing his wheel rode out on lhe <Jr:int and for
several hours iv a driving raiu he persistently
whipped the surface of che overflow with
artistic casts that would tempt any ordinary
trout to instantly commit suicide, but with
out success. They were not there. It is
claimed that "Parson" Upson was also a vic
tim. A fly-casting club will soon be organ
ized. Report has i i that the trout are taking
fhe fly in lbs vicinity of Truckee, ana that
several nice baskets of fish have been picked
out of the streams. William and John Gerber
went afield this week and made good baes of
English snipe, as the birds have been^lenti
lul of late. Joe Terry has at last received ln
lormation that will probably result in the
recovery of his valuable setter, which was
stolen several months ago.
The live bird shoot of thfl Pelican Gun Club,
heid last Sunday, demonstrated that "Xid r>
Nicolaus is as good at the feathers as he is at
the clay birds. The scores wre as follows:
E. A. Nicoluus 17, Rim Flint 16, H. Gerber 15.
F. B. Adams 14, F. Ruhstal er Sr. 13, F. Ruh

the U. C. men are anything bat confident.
Though buoyed ap by the series of suc
cesses against the Palo Alto men on the
rostrum, the debaters realize this time
that they have three formidable oppo
nents in the Stanford representatives.
As to the result of the athletic contest
the U. C. men are very apprehensive.
With a tie last year facing them, and a
minority of first-place men this year as
against a strong aggregation of Palo Alto
men, the chances for a victory are any
thing but promising. Yesterday and to
day have been spent by the athletes in
resting and in being rubbed down by the
trainer*. As to the debaters. H. A. Over

have been whetting their wits and putting
their arguments into final shape.
The debate will oe held at 8 o'clock in
Metropolitan Temple.
The field day will take place at the
Olympic grounds, beginning at 2 o'clock.
At 1 o'clock the bicycle races will be run

perience in Columbia
Square.
Two Footpads Lay in Wait for
Him in the Shadow of
a Tree.
Ona of the Robbers Has B:en Identi
fitd From a Cuff He Left
Behind.
John Heiden, a Frenchman, about 27
years of ape. has Deen paraded before
Captain Wittman's company in tbe hope
that some of the policemen might recog
nize b.m.
So far, Heiden remains unknown, ex
cepting by Elmer E. Mack, a laborer, who
arrived here irom Los Gatos last Tuesday
and whose sorrowful experience it was to
make Heiden's acquaintance Thursday
c veiling on the street.
Mack says he was taking in the Bights
along Market, street late on Thursday
nijtht when he was accosted by Hoiden.
They conversed, strolled along and drank
together. Some time after midnight, the
stranger appealed intoxicated and begged
Mack not to abandon him, but to help him
pet home.
Mack accommodated bis newly mads
friend, with whom ho walked down Fifth
street and turned up Folsoin. As the two
were opposite Columbia square Heiden
said they had better make a short cut;
'.hat his homo was somewhere on the
other side, on Harrison street.
There was no suspicion of wrong in
Mack's mind and he did as he was bid.
In the center of the part, where the trees
were thickest, two ruffians jumped from j
the shadow of a tree and began striking
Mack with clubs. Heidea joined in the
trouble, and between the tiire-.- they soon j
laid out their unfortunate victim. Before i
ho became unconscious his screams of ]
''murder" and "help" attracted the alien- !

footpads rleemg in tiie distance.
On the sround near tne prostrate form j
of Mack lay a striped linen cuff, evidently i
dropped by one of the trio.
Mack was robbed of a gold watch and
chain, a pistol and $J. He was conveyed I
to the Receiving Hospital for treatment.
The officers scoured ail the hara resorts
fcotiih of Market street in search of the
suspected robbers. On Rausch street they i

along in the shadow of the houses. When
he was brought to tne lipht it was noticed
that the cuff on the right sleeve of his :
fhirt was missing. The other one, how-,
pver, was the mate to thp striped one
found in the square next to Mack.
The victim, aa toon as he was able to
pet around, called at the City Prison yes- j

mediately recogr.ized the casual acquaint
ance he had madi the night before on j

HILL MUST HANG.
The Supreme Court Affirms the Verdict
in the Case of tho Oakland
"Wife -Murderer.
Benjamin L. Hill, the wife-murderer, of
Oakland must be hanged. Thus saith tbe
Supreme Court by a decision given yes
terdny.
Hill murdered his wife. Agnes, on one
of thf public streets of Oakland, January
11, 1 V)C, by shooting her.
As a reason he asserted that she had
been unfaithful to him and had acknowl
edged as much. His defense was insanity,
and a verdict was reached of murder in
the lirÂ»t degree and he was sentenced to
be hanged.
An appeal was presented to the Supreme
Court on the ground that the trial
Jud-e's rulings on the admissibilitv of
evidence were fatally defective. The
main ground of appeal was that he had
given the jury a form of verdict for
murder in the first decree, of the came
witli recommendation for life Imprison
ment, and of manslaughter, but none for
murder in the second degree.
The court held that this does not con
flict with law in any way, as no Judge is
required to give any form of verdict at all.
The verdict and order appealed from were
therefore affirmed, and wile-murderer
Hill must hang.

My Dear Sir and Comrade: I am in receipt I
of your letteroi the 31st u.t. Your suggestion
that there be a Lincoln cjy in this country,

c ate the heritage of America for a home, i
While I would be very ranch pleased to see the â

Mrs. Amanda Fisk-Marceau-Fennell ap
peared in Judge Coffey's court yeÃterday
to oppose the application of her recent
husband, Colonel Theodore C. Marceau,
to be released from the bond in the estate
of J. Allen Fisk, a minor.
Colonel Marceau represented to the
court that he wished to be relieved from
fnrti.er responsibility in this regard, the
minor named being no longer related to
him by marriage or otherwise.
Mis. Fennell filed an affidavit alleging
that Colonel Marceau has in his posses"
sion s veral thousand dollars belonging to
her child, and she tiiinks i c ought to be
compelled to pay what he owes before he
tries to shirk bis responsibility.
Jud.e Coffey thoncut thai was a reason

of the matter.

WHEAT MARKETS
ON THE JUMP
The Prevailing "Norther"
Is Shriveling the Cali
fornia Crop.
There Was Great Excitement
Yesterday Among the
Speculators.
War Scare and the Failure of the
Australian Crop Are Also Con
spiring Factors.
There is a boom in the local wheat mar
ket, and as is always the case on such oc
casions the speculators Are at a high, ten
sion of excitement.
Several conditions have conspired to
bring about this state of affairs, but
the one which had tlie most direct aud
effective influence on the local market was
theinformation emanating from the inte
rior of th 6 State that the hot "norther"
which is now sweeping down the coast is
having a disastrous effect upon the crop.
Dismal reports are coming in from all the
principal wheat-growing sections, and to
make matters worse the Weather Bureau
predicts that the scorcher has not as yet
exhausted itself â in fact, that to-day will
witness it in a more ravenous and devastat
ing mood than ever. Besides this local
condition the news coming from Chicago
is to the effect that the niarfcet there is
rising because of the probabilities of a
European war. The partial lauure of
the Australian crop is another potent
factor in the combination of inflating cir
cumstances.
The local market closed Thursday even
ing at an average price of $1 20 per cental
for December wheat, which was some
thing of an advance over the opening
price. The boom did not make itself
really manifest until the opening of tha
Produce Exchan^* yesterday morning,
and then it proved to be one of the sort
that seuds brokers flying about excitedly
in all directions, some of them, hatless and
ooatless, pu ling and hauling each other
unit gesticulating a:- if mad.
During the morning the December price
advanced in j^rks, a!id at the noon closing
had reached $1 2i. In the afternoon the
opening was quite as sensational, the
price being then $1 24%; but af'.er that a
slight reaction set in and t:;e price went
down litile by littie until the closing hour
was reached, and then it stood at $1 '2:1%.
Wheat men assert that the boom is here
to stay a while, and they are looking for
even more startling jumps next week, if
the European war news continues to be of
uu alarming character, and the local crop
reports confirm the story of disaster
caused by the "norther."
Comparatively few of the epeculaiors
were caught "short" on yesterday's rise.
The niaj'jr portion of them proved to be
too wary to be caught, ana were playing
the long end.
Until a few days ago the indications
were that the new Cali'orma wheat crop
would be cne of the largest ever known,
tut that has now apparently beenrele-'
gated to history as the result of the
scorchinz wind that is leaving ruin in its
wake. The Lay men say their market i?
doomed to be affected, too, and news is I
also nt hand that the fruit crop cannot
help suffering to some extent.
CORONER'S INQUESTS.
The IMm'miiir Coal Conipnny Blamed
for the Death of an
Employe.
The Coroner's jury held inquests yester
day in several "cases" of recnt date.
Much to the surprise of Coroner Hawkins
they rendered a veidict of suicide in the
case of P. O'Connor, found drowned.
O'Connor was a native of Ireland, aged 49
years, and there was no evidence what
ever that he committed suicide. The
Coroner refused to sign tbe verdict.
In the case of David Morris, barkeeper
of ti .Ewer place, a verdict of suicide by
drowning was returned, and this verdict
seemed to be justified by the facts. In the
case of Annie Devecchi the verdict of sui
cide by carbolic acid was arupiy justified.
The officers of the British ship Osborn
were exonerated for the death of 0. P.
Stewart, sailor on the uigut watch, who
died from injuries received by falling
down the hold. Death was due to ttie
negligence of the deceased, it having been
no part of his duty to open the hatches
leading to the hold.
A divided verdict was given in the case
of Leif TurÃcson, a native of Norway, who
was tilled by being struct by a falling
bucket of ceai at the Dunsiuuir Com
pany's bunkers. The majority of the jury
returned a verdict that deaih was caused
by an utiavotuaulc accident and that no
biame was attached to his employers.
Thin veidict was signed by A. fc>. Howeii,
T. H. McOi.bbin, William Doliver, J. H.
Manor and Albert AugU9t.
The minority verdtcl was signed by C.
S. Warner and C. 0. .Bradley. It declared
that the accident was due to negligence on
the part of the Dunsruuir Company be
cause the company had not provided
s ifety hooks on the coal-bucket. Coroner
Hawkins approved of this ver !ict and dis
sented from the majority verdict.
Debate of Municipal Government.
Recently the Merchants' Association re
ceived a request from the Sacramento Night
School Debating Club to send the club <U1 in
formation possible relative to city charters, as
it was the intention of the club to have a
public discussion upon the subject of muni
cipal government. The association complied
with the wishes of the club and :orwurded all
information available upon the question. A
letter of thanks was receivvd yesterday lrom
the club iv which it was stated that resolu
tions were unanimously adopted by the Sac
ramento Night School Deba inÂ« Club thank
ing the Merchants' Association for its kind
ness in lorwaraing the documents requested
Â»nd assuring the association that the boys of
Siicramento would not be fotind wanting in
their patriotic desire to improve the condi
tions of the capital of the State.
Pure Food Congress.
At a recent meeting of the board of directors
of the Manufacturers and Producers' Associa
tion the place of holding the Pure Food Con
gress was changed from Chamber of Com
merce Hall to Pioneer Hall, on Fourth street,
near Market. Tho change whs made to secure

Suits for divorce have been ti:ed in the Su-
perior Court as follows: Linda Schn'z against
Franz E. Schu!z. for failure to provide; Cath

TELL DEAD.
Heart Disease Suddenly Ended the Life
of an Invalid Miner.
A man, pale of face and feeble, with his
ieft hand ciuiching convulsively at his
breast, staneered into a drugstore at the
corner of Mission and Twenty-first streets
and astonished the clerk and shocked sev
eral ladies by falling dead.
After the bo^y had been removed to the
Morgue it was learned that the dead man
was Joseph It. Armstrong, a native of
Scotland, 51 years old. He had been at
tended for a long time by Dr. Mulligan
for what is known to the profession as
"aortic insufficiency and mitral thicken
ing:," otherwise known as be:Â«rt disease.
The deceased lived at 1123'^ Valencia
street and was a miner.
NEVER PUBLIC PKOPERTY.
City and County Attorney Creswell's
Opinion on Two Chinatown Alleys.
City and Connty Attorney Creswell haÃ
rendered an opinion in response to a query
from the Board of Supervisors, to the ef
fect that Sullivan and Baser alleys in
Chinatown are not public thoroughfares,
because tney were never dedicated to pub*
lie use.
In 1847 John Sullivan bought the prop
erty having a frontage of 275 feet on Pa
cific street and 137}* feet on Dupont for
$31 25. At one time it yielded an income
equal to that of $1,250,000, and it is still
worth a fortune. Sullivan held it until
the time of his death in ISB2, and it now
belongs to the Sullivan Â£siate Company.
BOYS WILL PLAY BALL.
A Strong League Formed From
Pupils of the Grammar
Schools.
Eight Teams Are in the Field and
the First Gime Will Be Next
Friia?-
The baseball fever baa seized on the
grammar school boys of the City, and a
league, composed of a team from each of
eight schools, has been formed, and the
boys are practicing for the first game.
The schools include 1 in the league are
the Hearst, Clement, John Swett, Wash
ington, Everett, Hamilton, Adams, Cos
mopolitan and Mission. Each of these
schools has tent two delegates to the
Central Governing Board. They are as
follows: Hearst, William L. Smith andQ.
W. Smith; Clement, W. C. Olwell and D.
Scultzer; Washington, F. Oawlev and W.
McKane; John Swett, Harry Eggers and
Walter McCarthy; Everett, Harold Coft
nian and Frank McGovern; Hamilton, B.
W.Â»t*on and J. Lapeile; Adams, T. Jones
and N. Jacobsen; Mission, Arthur Brown
and George KaUer.
The >cne:ne originated in the John
Swett Grammar School, and was tfce out
growth of a desire of the boys to challenge
some team to a game of baseball. They
enlisted the energies of W ulard D. Kines
bury, vice-principal of the John Swett
School, and he suggested the formation
ot a league. Thirteen of the bigger schools
were a^ked to join, and eight responded.
Delegates from the*e have met twice, and
have perfected the Public School Baseball
League.
T c eight teams will be divided into
two series, and each series will play for
its own championship, and then the
| champions will play together for the
trophy. In the first series will be the
Jotin Swe:t, Hearst, Fverett and Hamil
ton ; thÂ« Clement, Mission, Washington
ami Adams will be in the second series.
The games will be played on Friday
afternoons, th 9 first to be next Friday.
On thai occasion the John Swett and
Hearst teams wili play. Tne Friday after
the Clement and Washington teams will
pluy, and after that, on the same after
noon, the Evereus and Hamilton*. The
last game will be played on the last Fri
day of the term â June 18. Thirteen
-units will then have been played, and
every team will have played with every
other in its own series.
Each team will pus $1 into the general
fund for expenses, and 10 cents admission
wiil be charged at cacti game. The only
qualification necessary to the players will
be that they must bear a certilicate from
the principal of their school showing that
for thirty days they have been bona fide
pupils of the schools they hail lrom.
The officers of the central board of the
league are: W. D. Kmgsbury, president;
Frank McGovern, vice-president; W. C.
Olwell, secretary, and William L. Smith,
treaturer. There is also a committee on
appeals and grievances, one on grounds
an J another to secure an umpire. The '97
basebail rules wili govern all games.
The trophy has not been purchased nor
has it been decided upon. It will prob
ably be a pennant or a banner, or if sonn
enthusiast will present the choice will be
left to him.

Mattoon, 111., Aug. 29, 1898. :
"My name is Mary E. Miller, 1 am 44 years

County, Illinois. About two years ago I
was attacked with inflammatory rheumat- '
ism of a severe type Â«nd confined to my ,
bod for three mouths. Physicians, of whom
I had two, could not do me any pood, and I
was getting worse instead of better. It was
then thai 1 determined to try Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills for Pale People, which I had ssei
advertised so widely, and to this end obtained i
a supply. In nddiiion to Hie rheumatism I
was suffering greatly with nervous debility,
but after taking less than one box the nervous
ness be.nau to abate, and presently the rheu- \
matic rains grew less. By the time two boxes i
had been taken I was able 10 walk, which I
hod not done since I was first attacked, my ap- '
petite re turned and I soon regained my health, !
and am now as strong as ever I was. I always i
keep Pink Pills by me and always snail, for 10
them I owe my bea th. under Providence, and '
I shall sound their praises whenever and wher- j
evt-r I can.

AUSTRALIAN WHEAT CROP SHORT.
United States Consul Bell, writing from Sydney,
N. s. W., A rail 1. has the following to say
about tho wheat crop in Australia: "The wheat
crop of Australia for the coming harvest Is short.
It must be remembered that the seasons here are
opposite from ours, the cereal year beginning and
ending about the Ist of July, as our* in the United
States begins and ends about January 1. This
â¢year.' Of which I am now writing, will end July
1 next, or, as far as wheat alone is concerned, say
April next. The wheat crop of Australasia, as
estimated by the most careful observers, falls so
short of the usual as to reduce Australasia from
her position as the sixth wheat-exporting country
on the globe to about the eleventh wheat-import
ing country.
"From being an exporter of about 12.000,000
bushels per y>ar A nstralasla will have to import not
far from 6,000.000 to supply the deficiency from
short crops. This misfortune to Australasia will be
Of considerable benefit to our people, not only be
cause the United Stales will supply the chief part
of the nearly 5.000.00J bushels deficiency, but be
cause she win also supply a large pÂ»rt of me
world's deficiency, caused by the withholding of
the 12.000.000 usually furnished by Australasia.
Then, In the competitive markets of the world,
Australasia' abort crop makes a difference of
about 17,000,000 bushels. With a failure in India
and a short crop throughout Europe tins will be no
trifling advnntagu 10 the wueal-growers of the
United Stales."
THE WEEK'S FAILURES.

WOOLâ Wollner's Circular says: "The
market Is somewhat quieter. Mostly all the Wools
that could be obtained In the country have been
bought up, most of It by two sblppln?-hoases be
tween whom a rivalry existed as to who would 00
--laiu no most Wools, and it seemed that price and
quality were no. consideredâ on. y the amount of
Wool they could obtain. They employed every
available man they < ould got to go Into the coun
try, beside their regular buyers, and watched per
sonally every lot that came to this market and
raised the prices higher than could be obtained In
the Eastern markets. Of course there are always
some who are prone to follow toe leader so prices
ran up, both here and In the country, o a figure
which at pres-nl no market in the world would
Justify. There is some little buying going on and
me local woolen-mills have come into the market
and have taken some Fall Wools. It is bard to
speculate on tariff legislation, a< no one can tore
tell what the Senate will do or how quickly, so the
Wool business is rather quiÂ«i In the East and rnoit
trading 1* done In foreien Wools. The arrivals
have been large, from 600 10 10 JO bales per day.
and warehouses are tilling up I expec* a quiet
marke. for some time to come."

'Wheelbarrow Inateart or Knapsack.
Major Padrin of the Italian army has
invented a very ingenious contrivance,
which is designed to supersede the knap
sack. He has invented a vehicle to which
' be baa civen tne name of the cvclosac, or
i the sack on *h els. On this will be car
ried ihe baggage of two soldiers, and the
j uprights of the tent will be used to con
â  vert it into a sort of wheelbarrow, which
tbe soldier can drag behind him when
ascending or push before him when de
scending. The two soldiers will take it
turn about to push or draw the cyclosac,
and it is contended that this arrangement
will not merely enable the troops to
march much longer distances, but to
iieht much better on tbe field of battle,
being relieved of all impediments, which
can be left in thece light wheelbarrows in
the rear.â Philadelphia Record.
Very old people need from a third to
half as much food as when in their prime.

"B. J. Wood, Undertaker, 1 ' is a very
natural appearing name and business and
being so it was but natural that Deputy
Cotintj Clerk Ruppricht, who represents
Kden Township in the county clerk's
office, should mail the party a notice to pay
polit-x.
Mr. Ruppricht cannot yet understand
bow he made the mistake, and he stiil has
a pariial idea that he has been imposed
Â« xifion. But he has not

father it a clergyman. The undertaker,
however, is exempt under the law? of Cal
ifornia, from paying polltax, but the rarty
is neither under twenty-one nor over
sixty, "nor an insane i>erion, an idiot or
an Indian not taxed." As a matter of
fact, the undertaker's right name is Miss
Be?s c J. Wood who is the only lady un
dertaker in this city, and it was with con
siderable amusement tuat she received
an official notice to pay polltax. She
vrrote ;o the deputy and informed him
tbat she was exempt from politax, but
signed herielf "B. J. Wood." Mr. Rup
pricht still believed he was right.
More recently Deputy Kuypricht has
made a little investigation, and he is con
vinced tne lady is right and that although
an un -eruker he cannot collect from her
any nolltax.
Misa Wood is the daughter of Rev. I. D.
Woo 1, and a few months ago she became
convinced that a female undertaker ih one
of the greatest needs of modern society.
She has no desire to drive a hearse or
handle morcue caÂ«es, but she is very pro
nounced in her opinion that relatives <>i
departed females would far rather have
their friends attended to by a lady un .er
taker.
When she fir>t started out it was difti
( It for her to find any undertalc;::^
I'arl.ors where she could learn her business,

"that there is no Jeeal oar to a woman

ihjÂ»t the should be in aiJ respects on an
equal footing with men." When reminded,
:.owtver, that it wouid have been but the
carryinsr out of hei own j>rinrinles to have

most of the Chinamen are now doing this

Teachers in Doubt.
OAKLAND. Cal., April 23.â The teach

doubtful whether the ue>v pension law ap

take advantage of the measure and the
County Treasurer is the custodian of the
money and he alone can handle it. The
high-school teach-rs are paid ty the City
Treasurer and it is doub'.ful if he can
legally collect the money from the teach
ers and turn it over to the County Treas
urer.

SOCIALISM WAS
A DIRE FAILURE
E. L. Fischer Has Returned
From the Tcpolobampo
Colony.
Everybody Works Independently
and the Colonists are Uni
formly Successful.
â¢
A Glowing Report Which Contrasts
Strarg ly With Other Stories '
From the Settlement.
*
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, April 23. J
E. L. Fischer has just arrived from the
colony at Topolobampo, Mexico, where he
went with a party ei-ht years ago to estab
lish a socialistic colony. He is the first
one of the colonists to return, and he re
ports a very successful condition of affairs.
Mr. Fischer was formerly a resident of
Hay wards, but he declares that every thine
is progressing so smoothly at the colony
that he will soon return.
"Our colony is thriving wonderfully
well," said Mr. Fischer, "and everybody
is contented. We have now got an irriga
tion system that cost $200,000, and with
our big ditch we are independent of the
weather and therefore have a big ad
vantage over the native ranchers. The
colony is now mostly stocked with sugar
cane, which is very prolitable, and last ,
season the colonists averaged $50 an acre
from their canes. We also prow an
abundance of wheat, vegetables and fruit,
and it all finds a ready market.
"The people in the surrounding sections
purchase most of our produce, and we
nave no difficulty whatever in procuring
all the naiive labor we want at forty cents
a day. Land is cheap and a splendid fu
ture is ahead lor settlers, of whom there
are altogether too few.
"vVhon we went down there we com
menced to wort on socialistic lines. We
shared tlie labor and we â hired the prod
uce, and for a time all went well. As our
scope of work increased, however, we
found that Uie socialistic plan did not
vork. Then various unlooked-for conten
tions arose, and It was found very difficult
for a lar^e colony to get along on the com
munistic plan, The syiteru worked for
awhile, but .-Â«onie time ago we were forced
to abandon it. and the socialistic idea was
therefore a failure.
"We continued to prosper, however, and
now everybody is running on an inde
pendent basis and we tind it much better.
There are now first-class schools and
churches and I do not know of a better
place ior people to live who are willing to
work and who are inte licent."
Mr. Fischer says that he will remain
here for a few months and will alterant to
lake another crowd 01 colonists down to
Mt-rico with him.
His present plans call for his return in
October.
The glowing report of Mr. Fischer pre
sents a strange contrast to many stories
that have been sent up from Topoio
bmnpo and which told of privations,
losses and ill success ail over the colony.
Tiicse s-tories might have been sent out
by some of those who wore responsible
;or ihe failure of the socialistic plan, but
Mr. FiÂ«cher says the colony now speaks
for itself.
SENATOR DENISON RETURNS.
Says He I* Still a Candidate to Succeed
John Daggett. I
OAKLAND, Cal., April 23.â Senator
Eli.Denison has returned from Wash
ington, whither he went 10 try to succeed
John Daggett as superintendent of the
Mint. He says that the stories of bis
having wi hdrawn from the Mint fight
are not true. The Mint matter is not set
tled yet, according to the Senator, and he
still considers himself a candidate.
".Mr. Hanna told me." paid Senator
Denison, "that the nomination will not
be made for about two months. Being
still in the ficrht, I am not and hay never
been a candidate for postmaster of Oak
land. I had a pleasant chat with the
Piesi 'ent, and when Senator Perkins told
him that 1 was the man who sent him the
live eagle laÂ«t Oclob r we had a good
laugh."
STILL TRYING SUICIDE.
The Young Circus Woman Repeats Her
' Coast Experience at Natr
Orleans.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call )
908 Broadway, April 23. j
â¢ Mrs. Laura Trice, the woman who
makeÃ a living by jumping off bridges
and pretending to commit suicide, has
now reached New Orleans. A few months
ago she created a sensation by performing
the same ..rick near Hay ward?.
At that time she was .brought to the
County Jail and Sheriff White was ex
tending practical sympathy to her until
he discovered ,that she had been imposing
in a like manner on the officials in a
dozen interior towns in this State.
Last. Monday morning in New Orleans
a young woman created considerable ex
citement by jumping into the Ola Basin
in the - presence of a crowd. She was res
cued and turned over to the police, to
whom she told her pitiful story.
There was the same tale of marriage at
13, circus-riding, desertion by a cruel hus
band and a desire to die, ana not knowing
any better the officials treated her with
marked sympathy. She told them thai
she had traveled down this coast and
across to New Orleans, and also sprung
her old story of a sister keeping a board"
ing-bouse in New York who would care
for here if transportation be furnished.
Mrs. Price in New Orleans is Mrs. Maud
Virginia Ballard, and unless the people
there have learned the truth the adven
turess has probably been furnished trans
: portation to some city where she will re
; peat her star act.
A QUEER COINCIDENCE.
Attempted Burglary at the Residences
of a Bride and Groom.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 23.â A queer
coincidence in the burglary line took
place early Thursday morning on Central
avenue in this city. On Wednesday night
occurred the Page-Peck wedding. After
thÂ« festivities were over and ail had re
tired in the P*ck residence at 2057 Central
avenue, Mrs. Peck was awaKened by some
noise, and going to her window saw a man
who appeared to be endeavoring to gain
lan entrance to the front door. Knowing
i that all the valuable wedding presents
were in the house, she concluded that the
burglar must be after them. She called to
him and lie at once too* flight.
About tie same time, or perhaps a little
1 later, the occupants of the house a few
doors away, where the bridegroom had
resided prior to hi-, marriage, were awak
ened by some noise downstairs, and upon
investigating found that burglars had
paid them a visit as well. From indica
tions found in the dining-room there must
' have been two of the intruders, and the
â  first thing they had done was to reeale
themselves with food and drink. Before
they concluded the repast and got down

Did Not Celebrate,
BERKELEY, Cal., April 23.â 1n ad
dressing the Associated Stuuents to-day
I\es)de?t William R. Davis of the Alumni
Association made some pointed remarks
about the failure of .'â¢tudents and facu.ty
to attend the charit-r-day exercises la:-t
month. Mr. Days thought ihe absence of
students and professors was evidence of a
state ol feelina that if persisted in must
result disastrously for the institution. He
declared ihat of 146 professors and in
structors only thirteen went to hear the
charter-day speeches and said ibat those
who stayed away were actuated by a
harmful spirit of individualism.

cisions yesterday, in which he confirmed
the City'a title to certain pans of Lafay

can be disposed of by the feupreme Court
proceedings will be instituted by the City

Now that the city election is over and

This revival of official baseball has been
made possible by tne number ot young
men recently elected to office. In past
administrations age ha 3 been considered a
necessary qualification to cam official
salaries, but the advent of young men's
Republican clubs has dispelled this idea
and young men are now in the creat ma
jority. Will Prin-rle, the president of the
Council, is but L' 4 years of age. HiÂ« youth
was a month ago considered a detriment
to him, bul now that the principles oi
municipal covernmeut and other rath
trifles have been subordinated to baseball,
the young man who can mate most base
bits will be the hero of the City Hall. Oak
land always lias been the great bailiwick
of small boys, and now that they are to ba
given an opportunity to "root" it is ex
pected that Jafcey Bntirogarten, the leader

ENDEAVORERS
HARD AT WORK
Plans Are Now Being Per
fected to Welcome the
Easterners.
Sacramento and Fresno Form
Reception Headquarters
for Trains.
Reports of Committees at the Las:
Meeting â Names of Organ za
tions Changed ;
The reception committee which will
have charge of the work of welcoming to
California the throngs of Christian En
deavorers who will come here next July
met last Tuesday evening at ~ the head
quarters of the committee of '97 in the Y.
M. C. A. building: A. 8. Johnson, chair
man of tne committee, presided, and all
the ?Ã¼b-c omnmtee* v. ere well represented,
there being fourteen members present.
The reports of the sub-committees dis
closed much of interest in regard to the
plans for work next July. Robert Cle
land, chairman of the sub-committee on
railroads, reported tnat that committee
had already met and formulated general
plans for its work. It was decided to be
gin work at Fresno in the south and Sac
ramento in the north.
The size of the committee will depend
upon the number of trains bringing dele- j
gates, and this will be determined later by I
consulting the itineraries of the various
State delegation!. One member of the
committee will be assigned to each
through train. The committee expects to
assist the entertainment and registration
committees by distributing on the trains
cards for the assignment of entertain
ments and registration cards, so as to pre
vent confusion and accumulation of work
at the registration booths.
The sections of the reception committee,
which will be made up of residents of
Sacramento and Fresno, will be selected
from those who expect to attend the con
vention in San Francisco. As each train
draws into the station in these two places
the local reception committee will be on
duty, ana If time permits will give each
Endeavorer in the train a hearty hand
shake ana a warm California welcome.
Then each train will be boarded .by a
member of the railroad committee and
several members. of the local reception
committee, who will come through to the
City. The train will be in charge of the
member of the railroad committee, and
the name of the person in charge, the
name.-" of the Slate delegations occupyin â¢
the train and the number on board will
be telegraphed to the committee in San
Francisco, so that exact preparations can
be made to receive and care for the vis
itors.
The arrangements for the north, with
headquarter* at Sacramento, will be in
charge of the chairman of the road i
committee, Mr. Cleland, assisted by Vice-
Chairmen Clark and Jenkins. In the
south the plans will be carried out under
the supervision of Lester B. Smith, as
sisted by Fabius Finch.
The committee on stations will be on
duty in two division?, covering the Va
lencia-street station on the coast division
of the Southern Pacific Railroad and the
station at the foot of Market street. . The j
members on duty at these two stations
will be divided into three shiftsâmorn
intr, afternoon ami evening shifts. At the
loot of Market street these will consist of
twenty-rive each and at Valencia street of
ten each.
Upon the arrival of delegates they will
be conducted in parties of about ten to
the Pavilion for registration and will then
be taken to their stoppins-piacea. Mem
bers of this committee will be expected to
provide themselves with a joyful counte
nance, a warm handshake and a large
fund of information as to the points of in
terest in and about the City, the streetcar
lines, transfer privileges, etc
The other sub-committees are unable to
'report definite plans, because arrange
ments of other committees being incom
plete they could not pet the information
necessary to enable them to make the
plans.
The central executive committee of the
reception committee is in future to be
known as the reception committee staff,
the sub-committees will be called sections
and the rank and tile of the committee
aids. - ' . '

Charged With touting the Poor .Estate
of George W. Cornwall.
: Mr.'. Felicia B. Cornwall nai given a
Rood reason for not paying the debts of
her late l'tisband, George W. Cornwall.
When asked why she had neglected to
obey the or lor of the court Mrs. Cornwall
told Judge Coffey Wednesday that she wa->
willing to settle the account, but that her
husband's estate amounted to only $172 25
and of this sum not a nickel had ever
come into her possession:
"E. M. Morgan .was my attorney," said
Mrs. Cornwall, sadly, "and i c went with
me to draw the wage* due my husband
from the railroad company. Mr. Morgan
put the money in his poctet and said he
couldn't give it to me without an order of
court. Since then I have not bee.-i able
to pet anything from him. He has left

CAUSE OF DELAY
IN CHINA MAILS
Postmaster McCoppin Sends
aLstterof Explan
ation.
He Believes the Fault to Lie
With the Quarantine Au
thorities.
The Chamb.r of Commerce Will Peti
tion the Postal s.. r-G.-neral to
Abate the Evil.
At the last annual meeting of the Cham
ber of Commerce the question was raised
and widely discussed of tne delay in the
distribution of the China mail-* alter they
reach this port. Complaint was made by
Horace Davis that in several cases delays
of thirty hoars were shown and, in one
particular instance, a delay of forty-seven
hours.
Accordingly Postmaster Frank McCop
pin was communicated with by Captain
Merry in regard to the dilatory transmis
sion of the mails and the iorn; quarantine
in which they were placed. In reply, the
following communication was received
yesterday:
San Francisco, Cal., April 22, 1897.
lion. William L. itxrry. Secretary and Treat- \
vrer of the Chamber of Commerce of San Fran
ciscoâDear Sik: 1 be.; to acknowledge receipt
of your letter of the 22d inbU in behalf of the
Chamber of Commerce, with which you were
pleased to transmit to me a communication
irom the Sperry Flour Company of this City,
complaining of the delayed delivery of Asiatic
mails.
In reply thereto I would state that the facts,
as outlined by Hon. Horace Davis of the Sperry
Flour Company, are In the main correct. The
responsibility lor this state of things does not.
however, rest with the postal service. Mr.
Pavis culled at this office a few days since rela
tive to this matter, in.! was furnished with a
lull statement of the circumstances giving rise
to the delays complained of. The matter is
one which rests entirely with the quarantine
authorities.
With a view to expediting the delivery of
these mails I have oeen in constant corre
spondence with both the quaiantinp officials
end the steamship companies since tne
Asiatic ports were declared infected by the
Board of Health of this City. I have cone
even further than my duty as a Po-tofficv offi
cial requires by placing two of my own men
at the quarantine station 10 receive the mails
aud hasten their passage through thedisin
lee ting process.
The regulations of the Federal quarantine
require that mi.!l> shall remain in the tanks
about sixteen hours. The remainder of the
time is consumed in checking and preparing
the mulls for fumisration, rebagging them ana
getting them across from Angel Island to this
office.
1 mlly realize the annoyance resulting to
the business community irnm this state of
things, and would be m Ist happy to co-<.per
flte with your chamber in effecting a remedy,
If such can be found.
I can only add that every effort is being
made by this department to meet the situa
tion and that I hold myself in readiness to
co-operate with your chamber in aiy future
steps which it may think tit to take louking to
arvmeiy. lam, ir. 'hÂ» meantime, yours very
respectfully, Fkank McCorpiN, Postmaster.
P.y R. E. Doyie, As=i*tant Fosim ester.
It is very probable that the next step of
the cliamber will be to *end a petition
to the Postmaster-G ere-al at Washington
and try to have the hours of fumigation
lessened. In tnis step Mr. McCoppin, as
Been by his letter, will doubtless co
operate.
BIG IMPEOVEMENTS.
A Prenldio Heights That May Have
Much Money Spent on It
A resolution of intention was adopted
by the Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors yesterday to improve a large
tract in the Presidio Heights district by
public contract. The tract embraces
sixteen blocks bounded by First aud
Central avenues and Sacramento ami
Jackson streets and the idea is to bi
tumin.ze tne roadways, lay -walks and
generally improve the section. The cost
of the work will be from $125,000 to
$150,000.
The petition on which the resolution
was based came from the Presidio Heights
Improvement Club, but the matter will
by opposed by several large property
owners who claim that such improve
ments are premature.

DURRANT'S
STRANGE
WITNESS
Remarkable Tale Told by
an Aged Arizona Pros
pector.
GHOSTS CAUSED A MAN
TO CONFESS.
Henry Schaffer Says a Man
Named Brown Exonerated
the Accused.
HIS STORY DISCREDITED BY
CAPTAIN BOHEN.
Owing to Late L?gal Proceedings ;
Durrant May Not Be Hanged
Before October.
I
A remarkable story comes from an al- '
leged prospector of ibe remote mining
regions of Arizona named Henry Schaffer, ;
who claims to have come to this City J
from bis seclusion about four days ago to j
collect about $2000 in pension money due ,
him and to prosecute a claim for Tele- :
graph Mili based on an alleged Spanish
{rant to that eminence.
He claims to have been seated in Un;on
iquare i'ark yesterday and to have there 1

Says a Man Named Erown Confessed to Him the
Emmanuel Church Murders.
overheard two men talking of the Dur
rant case. This, he stated, recalled 10 his
mind an occurrence of about twenty-otic
months ago. The remembrance induces
him to enter the drugstore of Samuel F.
Hughes, at the northwest corner of
Powell and Post streets, and ask Mr.
Hughe* to look up for him the address of
Theodore Durrant's father.
ilia story is that about a year and three
quarters upo four men came to his cabin
in the White Hills, about forty miles from
railroad communication, in a spring
wagon and asked for accommodations for
tbe night, whicti be granted. He had two
beds and gave one to three of the men and
himself alept with the fourth.
During tbe night bis bed-fellow was ex
tremely restless, starting up frequently
and shouting "take it away." The miner,
continuing his tale, said that at last he
woke the stranger up and remonstrated
with him, saying he must be demented.
He told tbe troubled sleeper of his demon
strations, and tbe latter then, under great
mental stress apparently, remarked:
"I must tell it to somebody.
"I have murdered two girls in San Fran
cisco and bad to flee to eÂ«ca)>e punish
ment. Another man is now arrested for
the crime, but I guess he will get out of it
all riuht.
"We are obliged to keep away from tele
graphic communication, because the oili
cers of the law may even now be on my
trail. I killed the two girls in a church,

of Cuticcba Resolvent, greatest of blood
purifiers and humor cures, when all else fails.

and their gbosts come and trouble me so t
cannot sleep. The men with me do do
know what 1 have done."
Scnaffer says the tnree men along with
the fellow were loaded down with jewelry
and optical instruments, which tie de
clared were stolen from a San Francisco
jewelry store about the time the murder
took place. Next day all four men took
their departure and he never saw them
again.
When seen last night at his place of
lodging, 515 Howard street, Schaffer said
in addition:
"The man told me his name was Brown
and that he had a brother in Napa City.
He also said that others in the church in
which he committed the murders knew a
good deal more about it than they were
ever likely to tell, but he refused to tell
me the name of the church or the girls he
had killed.
"I am going out to visit Durrant's
father in a day or two and see if some
clew cannot be obtained to the men's
whereabouts. It may be that this Durrant
is innocent of the crime. I can't conceive
why this man should tell me such a tale
unless it were true."
SchafFer is a German^ 74 years of age.
He does not seem to desirn notoriety and
tells his story In a straightforward way
that cannot fail to imprest the bearer.
He gives absolutely no impression of
being demented.
Schaffer says that he served under Gen
eral Fremont und shows numerous bullet
scars to prove his claim. From an old
Spanish grant he claims a part of Tele
graph Hill, and has been referred to At
torney W. W. Foote to prosecute the
claim. Attorney Foote, when telephoned
to in Oakland last night, said tnat the
man had not yet apoiied to him and that
he bad not *o much as beard of him.
Captain Ben Bohen, the veteran detect
ive, discredits i tie man's story entirely
and is as much as ever inclined to believe
In Durrant's gnilt.
A POSSIBLE RESPITE.
Probability That Durrant Will Not
Be Hanged Until Some Time
In October.
"Theodore Durrant will not be ha'.iged
on June 11." Such is the positive state
ment of Eugene N. Deuprey, who is now
singly making tbe tight to save t tie neck
of the condemned murderer of Blanche La
mom.
According to the calculations of Mr.
Deuprey, the fatal day, if it comes at all,
will necessarily have to be postponed until
some date subsequent to the opening
term of the July session of the Supreme
Court.
The execution will be stayed, tbe coun
sel for the defense claims, by reason of the
appeal that ha- been taken to tht> Supreme
Court from the judgment of Judge Bahrs
in resetting the day for the banging of
Durrant.
The appeal, it will be remembered, was
taken on the very day that Judge iiahrs
â set June 11 for the day of Durrant's doom,
and was in port on tbe ground that the
Judge in pronouncing the sentence of
hanging nad coupled with it Â»he alleged
additional and illegal punishment of con
finement in the Bta'.e prison at Han Quen
tin uniii the day of execution, thus mak
ing tbe convicted murder r suffer, as the
counsel for Durrant claims', the uncalled
for and unlawful indignity nnd humilia
tion of being garbed in convict siripes and
being treated generally as a felon of less
degree than a murderer.
According to the mips of the Supreme
Court In the matter of appeals in criminal
| cases, me defendant hai thirty days in
which to file the transcript on appeai.
Ten more daya is allowed for the filing of
the defendant's brief giving points and
authorities. Another ten days is granted
the Attorney-General to file his briet in
the case, and then the defendant has five
more days to file his answer.
It is not nnhkeiy that every day thus
placed at the disposal of the de!en*o in
tlie Durrant case will be fully utilized,
and thus fifty-live days will have been
consumed in getting ibe appeal properly
before the Supreme Court. When .all
these preliminaries hÂ»v<*been disposed of,
it is the custom of the S.ipreme Court to
set a aay for argument, which in this case
will be oral, and will, if the usual custom
is followed by the Supreme Court, be de
ferred until the July term of the court,
which opens in this City on the third
Monday in July, the 19th.
In this way ii is thought to safely tide
Durrant over the dread lltli of Jane. If
tnis is accomplished it will mean, even ii
the appeal is denied, as was that taken
from Judge Murphy, that the day of exe
cution will have to be set againâ probably
late in July or in Acrrust.
AÂ» the prisoner will probably be given
â¢ixty days from tbe time sentence is again
pronounced, his partimc from earth would
appear to be not nearer than October
next.
In case the appenl before the Supreme
Court faiU recourse will then be had to
the Federal court.
Eugene N. Deuprey smiled in quiet in
credulity when he was asked what be
thought of the article published in yester
day's Examiner purportinc to set forth an
admission of guilt made by Durrani to
Frank Kloss, the murderer who was
hanged at San Quentin yesterday. Kloss
is alleged to have selected an Examiner
reporter as his confidant, notwithstanding
that his alleged object of revenge in be
traying Durrani would have been best
served by conveying his information to
an official of the prison.
According to the extremely transparent
fake of the^ Examiner Durrant, alter lis
tening ;o Kloss' coniefsion of his guilt
and discussing Kloss' crime, said: "lam
just as guilty as you aie, but the only
tning we can do is to try to save our
selves." The Examiner in telling this
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 24, 1897.
BRAHMACHARIN BODABHISKSHU.
A learned and eminent Brahmin and ascetic, who is devoting his life to study,
will arrive at the Pamce to-night, and on Sunday evening will lecture in the
Native Sons' Hall on tbeosophy, a religion, if auch it may be called, to which he
devotedly adheres.
This strange man, who is pronounced by Countess Wachtmeister to be "ten
thousand times more eloquent than Dbarmapaln,'' is yet but a mere boy, judged
by American and European standards, be being but 21 years old. However, so
soon do the people of sun-burned India mature that Bodabhiskshu talks like*
sage or savant.
Tbe first part of his name, i. c., Brabmacharin, is a title like professor, in that
it is tbe name of an order to which be belongs. It is an order of celibates and
ascetics, who devote their lives to the study of spiritual things for the benefit of
their fellow men.
The Brahmacharin is dressed in a robe of white India silk and wears a white
turban of the same material. He is very tall and altogether presents a striking
appearance. He has recently been visiting England. He left London for New
York, went from there to Chicago, where he lectured, and then to Los Angeles,
where he has talked for the past few nights, and from which place he will arrive
this evening.
The singular Oriental will speak before the Women's Congress while here. la
all probability he will have crowded bouses on all occasions.
attenuated fairy-tale in two and a half
columns says: "When Kloss made his
statement be stood within his cell and
spoke to an Examiner representative
tnrongh the bars."
Deuprey referring to the matter said:
"I know there can't be a word of truth
in it. If the unfortunate wretch who bas
gone to his grave made any such sugges
tion it was made out of whole cloth. I
can't understand the object of such an ar
ticle as that. It seems to roe that the very
statement that it wan for revenge would
stamp it as untrue. It uon't 'pnase' me.
I have my opinion that the man is inno
cent, it is what he has always declared
to me in confidence. It is not likeiy that
he would take such a man as Kioss, if
that man is of the character that I un
derstand, into his coniidence.
"I am satisfied that all tne conversation
thai ever took place between them must
have been along the lines of religious con
solation offered by Durrant. I nave read
the article and it is entirely at variance
with everything 1 know.''

sion, hare charges of assault to rob pend
ing against, them. White has a rather
severe knife-wound in the stomach.
Early yesterday morning word was sent
to t tie Seventeenth-street station that a
man was lying seriously injured in a drug
store at the corner of Twenty?eventh and
Church streets. Lieutenant Burke and Po
liceman Kinbille at once hastened to the
scene nnd found White stretched upon
the floor, where be had been hastily
treated by Dr. yon Werthen, the proprie
tor of the drugstore. Foley was linger
ing about outside the store.
Lieutenant Burke questioned the men
as to the origin of the injury and they
concurred in such a hiehly improbable
account of an attack by a mysterioas
stranger that the officer decided to re
strain both of them. White was accord
ingly taken to the City and County Hos
pital to have bis wounds dressed. Foley
was taken to the Seventeenth-street sta
tion.
White did not appreciate the effort! of
the officers to have him cared for and dur
ing the afternoon made an attempt to
escape from the hospital. He was' cap
tured at the gate by Policeman Luke
Harrison and he was then taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where the facilities
for detention are better.
In the meantime Officer Stanley bad
found blood tracks on Twenty-seventh
street, leading toward Church, and had |
tiaced them to the vicinity of 327 Twenty
serenth street.
The occupant of this place, A. L. Brown,
volunteered the intormation that the
night before he had had a desperate en
counter with the youne men, in the course
of which he had cut one with a t>ocket
knife.
Brown is a c.-ossine watchman in the
employ of the Market-street Railway
Company. His duties keep him until 1
a. M., and while returning to his residence
I yesterday morning, he says, the men at
tacked him, appaiently with an mtpntlon
to commit robbery. "In the scuffle he
pulled his rocket-knife and cut one, when
they both fled.
Foley declined to tay any thine about
the affray, but White admits that be was
drinking Thursday ni^ht, and early Fri
day morning was in some kind of a row.
He declared robbery was not his motive,
though he does not remember the cause
of the quarrel.
Caught a Shoplifter.
Mrs. Rena Howard, 33 year* of age, was
arrested yeÂ«terday afternoon by Special Offi
cers Green ana Allen, employes of the Em
porium, and a charge of petty larceny was
placed against her. The woman whs accom
panied by a 2-year-old child and the officers
claim to nave watched her iv the act of steal-
Ing a cape and a petticoat.

ANGRY AT
THE CZAR
Greeks Will Not Attend
the Russian Church
To-Day.
LOYALTY TO MOTHER
COUNTRY.
The Great White Father's Ac
tions Have Made Hellenes
Resentful
ANOTHER CHURCH MAY BE
FORMED.
Twenty.Fire Greeks Have Gone to
Join the Army and a Few More
Wi.l Fjllow Tnrm.
The bitter and unrelenting war tnat is
now being waged between Greece and
Turkey has caused a serious breach in one
church of this City and will result in the
formation of another within a short time.
The loyal Greeks of this City have
always attended the Russian cathedral,
presided over by the Right Rev. Bish p
Nicholas, and which is under the control
of the Russian orthodox church.
This church ia supported the world over
by the Russian Government, and the
Great White Czar is its head and main
stay.
Therein lies the trouble in this City.
The Pan-Heilenic Society of San Fran
cisco, of which Mitchell Vanvales, the
Washington-street commission merchant,
is tbe president, numbers about 150 mem
bers, and it has been the custom for them
to attend Easter Â»ervices in a body. The
recent actions of the Czar, however, in the
trouble between their country and the
lana of the Sultan have decided the ma
jority to remain away from the annual
services that take place to-night.
They think that the ruler of the Russias
has shown a decidedly ami-Greek spirit
and they cannot consistently show re
spect for him by attending his church.
The Easter services of the Greek Cath
olic chuich are peculiar and have a par
ticular significance. Shortly after mid
night of the Saturday preceding Easter
Sunday the Bishop mounts the pulpit and
kisses the cross. Then the priests follow
him kissing trie cross and then the Bishop
and the congregation brings tbe ceremo
nial to a close by kissing tirst tbe cross,
then the Bishop, third the priests and
lastly hold a general kissing bee all
around.
This signifies "peace on earth, good will
to men," and local Greeks think It would
be farcical in view of the present condition
of affair-. They nave nothing against the
Bishop, in fact he is very popular with
most of the Greeks, but they have a griev
ance against the mainspring of thechurch
and will remain away from the institution
under his control.
Mitchell Vanvales said yesterday that
the Hellenic Mutual Benevolent Society,
of which ho is president, as * body
would not attend the Easter services at
the cathedral.
"Some of the members may feel like
gome," he said, "and no one will
object if they do, but it would not be
Siting in view of the Czar's actions to
ward our mother country to go as a so
cietr.
"We do not recognize the Russian
cathedral as our cnurcb and have merely
atteuded there because we have no church
of our own.
"I know one thing, however, and that
is that the Greeks of San Francisco will
have a ciiurcb of their own as soon as the
society ia In a financial condition to
build one and can get a priest out from
Greece."
Loyalty for the cause of Greece in its
struggle with Turkey still remains at an
enthusiastic pilch among the Greeks
living in this City and vicinity. Many of
them would be only too giad to juurney
to their native country and take up arms
for her, and would doubtless do so could
they raise sufficient funds to make the
trip.
"All who could afford the long and
i costly journey," said Mr. Vanvales, "have
I started tor Greece already. I mink about
twenty-five have gone to join the army.
The difficulty is that most of the Greeks
located out here are hard-working people
who have no bank accounts. If sufficient
funds could be raised we would send
about 200 more able-bodied young men to
figut the Turks, and they would prove to
bedashing soldiers, too. Our society has
but little money in its treasury, and this
is being drawn upon for sick benefits and
burial expenses; so you see we cannot do
as we would like to in the way of assisting
some of the patriotic ones to the scene of
the wai."
LABOR SPIRIT GROWING.
Andrew Furuseth Te Is What Ec
Saw in Many of the
States.
Workers Are G.-nerally Becoming
Alive to the Fact That Organ i
zation Is Necessary.
The San Francisco Labor Council held
an important meeting at its room", 1159
Mission street, last evening. A laiee at
tendance of delegates was present, as it
was known that Andrew Fnruseth, a mem
ber of the legislative committee of tne
American Federation of Labor, was to
explain what be saw at Washington, D. C,
and during bis travels through the East.
An invitation was received from the
International Federation of Ship, Doc*
and River Workers, which is to hold a
convention in London next June, request
ing that a representative be sent from
this City. It was referred to the Sailors'
Union.
A communication was received from E.
R. Bush, attorney for Worden, who is
sentenced to be handed June 5, statinc
that Governor Btidd's secretary bail
promised to call the Executive's attention
to the application for a pardon as soon as
the Governor should return from a vaca
tion, which he is now enjoying.
The pattern-makers reported that a
large Pittsburg concern bad reduced
wages 10 per cent and had increased the
hours from nine to ten. This, it was
thought, woald have a ten dency to affect
wages oveT the entire country.
The remainder of the evening was al
lotted to Mr. Furuseth, who trave a de
tailed history of the progress of all im
portant labor bills considered by Con
gress. The speaker had also traveled ex
tensively through the country making in-

for this reason his report was particularly
interesting.
He reported that be bad found the labor
organizations in the Ea*t, especially in
New York, Chicago and Baltimore, to be
in first-class shape. In New York an im- |
portant step had been taken by the build
ing trades in organizing the material
men. The American Federation of Labor,
he said, bad recently granted a great
many National trade cfiarturs.
In the South he found labor organiza
tions in a less satisfactory condition than
in the East, but earnest and telling efforts
were being made to effect an improve
ment.
The recent decision in the Arago case
holding that sailors can be imprisoned
for desertion, he said, was attracting
great attention among humanitarians
generally, and lawyers held it the most
important decision affecting personal
liberty since the Dred Scott case. The
movement to re-enact imprisonment in the
coast trade, he reported, had been vigor
ously and effectually opposed by Senators
Perkins, White, Allen and HilL There
was a tendency, he found, among trusts
and certain capitalists to curtail ttie right
of laborers to abandon a contract. This
end was beine moved toward by what
purported to be anti-trust laws.
On the whole, the speaker said, work
men were generally throughout the
United States becoming alive to the fact
that they must organize.
