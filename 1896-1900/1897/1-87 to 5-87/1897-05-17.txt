REPLY OF THE
PORTE TO THE
SIX POWERS.
Turkey Will Consent to an
Armistice Only on Her
Own Terms,
DEMANDS INDEMNITY OF FORTY
MILLION DOLLARS.
Armies of the Sultan Threaten to Force
Their Way to Athens, While the
Greeks Prepare for a Stubborn
Defense*
CONSTANTINOPLE, TURKEY, May 16.â The Porte yesterday
replied officially to the collective note of the powers requesting that
an armistice be declared. In reply the Porte declares it will not cease
hostilities before its own conditions are accepted. These are the
annexation of Thessaly, the payment by Greece of an indemnity of
Â£10,000,000 Turkish ($40,000,000), and the abolition of concessions
for Greek subjects in the Turkish Empire.
The Porte proposes that plenipotentiaries shall meet at Pharsala
to discuss the terms of peace. It affirms that if its conditions are not
accepted the Ottoman army will continue to advance on Athens.
After the reply had been revived the representatives of the powers
held a meeting to consider\it. It is believed they intend to urge the
Sultan personally to modify y\& conditions in the direction of placing
payment of the indemnity under European control, though the strength
of the military party in Constantinople is again given as the reason
for the Sultan not receding from the high terms imposed.
ATHENS, GREECE, May 17 â 4 A. M. â Though instructions have
been given that the Greek commanders must act entirely upon the
defensive, orders have been issued that the army at Dhomoko must on
no account retreat. Here a final stand must be made. Dispatches
from Dhomoko state that every measure has been taken to guard
against surprise, but no Turks have been seen for some days.
SCHEME OF THE POWERS.
They Want Control of Greeca's
Revenue and Payment of
Her Debts.
LONDON, Eng., Mar 16.â The solution
likely to be adopted of the question of in
demnity to be paid by Greece to Turkey is
the Russian scheme that has been framed
since the outbreak of the war, when it was
foreseen that Turkey wouid be the victor
and would demand an indemnity tha*
Greece would be unaDle to immediately
pay.
The powers are agreed to the extent of
thinking the prolonged Turkish occupa
tion ol Thessalv would raise grave
troubles. The only solution of the ques
tion will be a European commission to
administer the finances of Greece until
the indemnity is comDletely paid. Eu
rope will therefore make advances to
Greece, which will permit of prompt pay
men; to Turkey, which country is pieatly i
in need of money.
Telegrams from European capitals con
firm the forecoing. Diplomats in Rome
speak of the creation of, control and
guarantee of the Greek debt similar to the
control and guarantee of the Ottoman
debt. It is reported in London that the
control will embrace the interests of
Greece's creditors.
PARIS, Fbance, May 16.â A dispatch to
the Figaro from St. Petersburg predicts
that the powers will adopt Russia's scheme
of advancing money to Greece to enable
her to meet the demands of Turkey for the
expenses of the war. The writer adds he
has absolute authority for stating that If
angry Greeks molestor expel King George ]
and family from Greece then Russia, fol
lowed by other powers, will abandon
Greece to anarchy, which will render her
existence as an independent state prob
lematical.
ATHENS. Greece, May 16â At a late
hour to-night it was officially announced
that, in consequence of the representations
of the powers the Greek armies in Thes
saly an I Epirus had been ordered to hold
t emselves on the defensive. It was also
officially announced that the Greets had
evacuated the province of Epirus, and the
western squadron had embarked the
t-oops who had been besieging Nicopolis,
where the check to the Greek arms was
ascribed to strategic blunders.
A cessation of hostilities on the part of
the Greeks is assured from to-day.
THE INSOLENT THREAT.
It Is Asserted That Europe Will Not
Pfermit Turkey Any More Than
Greece to Be Saucy.
LONDON, Eng., May 16â ThÂ« Time? to
morrow will eititorially say: "It would be
a waste of time to discuss the Porte's con
ations, No doubt the powers will return
a rrompt and emphatic negative.' As re
gard the insolent threat that if the con
ditions are not accepted the Ottoman
army will continue to advance, it may
confidently be presumed that Europe will
not allow Turkey any more than Greece
to flout her."
The Standard's Constantinople corre- 1
The San Francisco Call
soondent says the Turks are gradually
ranging themselves into two parties. The
first is the Islamic party, headed by the
Minister of War. Their ideal is to revive
the old traditions of Islam end rule as a
conquering race on primitive Mussulman
lines, discarding the hitherto prevalent
Osmanlism, which aims to introduce
spurious European civilization. The sec
ond is the Ojmanli party, headed by Izzet
Bey and the diplomats. They seek to use
finesse in dealing with the European
powers, and not to excite their animosity.
The whole thing is, however, a farce, de
signed by the Suitan to enable him to pose
before Europe as the innocent and un
willing victim of fanatical and patriotic
subjects.
The Times' Constantinople correspond
ent says that Gsrmany is urging the
Sultan to insist upon European control of
Greek finances as the only means of secur
ing the payment of a war Indemnity.
Representatives of the Deutsche Bank
will arrive at Constantinople next Satur
day to take advantage of important con
cessions promised the bank by the Sultan.
BORDERING ON PANIC.
No Order Among: the Greek Troops
at Dhomoko and Many Have
Deserted.
LONDON, Eng., May 16â A dispatch
from Phar-ala dated Friday says desert
era who have arrived from the Greek
camp describe the condition of the Greet
army as bordering on panic. They say
the troops are half starved, their daily
ration being only a loaf of bread. They
are without tents and compelled to sleep
in the rain. They declare that since the
battle of Pharsala there have been nearly
4000 desertions from the Greek rank*.
This is probably an exaggeration, but it
seems all discipline is gone. Soldiers
don't salute the Crown Prince, their Com
mander-in-chief, and threaten their own
officers.
A dispatch from Larissa dated Saturday
says Edhem Pasha is rapidly completing
plans for the capture of DhomoKo. Many
battalions of re-enforcements have arrived.
The troops who have been impatient to
move upon the Greeks started an advance
at the dawn of Saturday. The Greek de
serters say 25,000 men are fortified at
Dhomoko.
GALLANTRY OF GREEKS
Soldiers Fight Valiantly In Epirus

CUBAN VICTORIES
ON EVERY HAND
Two of the Most Im
portant Battles of
the War.
Hundreds of Spaniards Slain
in Provinces Said to
Be Pacified.
Vast Quantities of Supplies, Arms
and Ammunition Captured by
the Insurgents.
HAVANA, Cuba, May 16. --The most
important batlle of the Cuban war is be
lieved to be one fought last week near
Manzanillo, Santiago de Cuba province, of
which authentic news has just been re
'ceiv^d. Colonel Ruiz concmanded the
Spaniards, who numbered 2000, and the
Cubans were led by General Rabi and
Carlos Garcia, a son of General Calnto
Garcia. The battle was fought two miles
from the town of Manzanillo. After a
whole day's lighting the Spaniard?, unable
to retire by land to Manzanillo, had to
embark on the steamer Reina de Los An
geles, making their escape by sea. Only
1300 soldiers were able to catch the
steamer, and under the fire of the insur
gents the rest were killed, wounded or
captured.
Spanish forces under Colonel Aguilara,
numbering 1500 men, met yesterday near
Guines, Havana province, the combined
Cuban forces of General Rafael de Car
denas and General Alejandro Rodriguez.
The insurgents numbered 1200, and the
force under Rodriguez was nearly all cav
alry. After an engagement of several
houre, Colonel Aguilara retired to Guines
with heavy losses His defeat was to
marked that many of his soldiers threw
awny their guns, which the insurgents
captured, as well as nearly all the horses
of the Spanish cavalry. The amount of
ammunition and other supplies camured
by tne Cubans makes this victory worth
as much to the Cuban cause as an expedi
tion landed from the United States.
The Spaniards left their wounded on tho
field, but they were cared for by the Cuban
physicians, and after the Spaniards had
abandoned the field word was sent to
Aguilaia by Generals Rodriguez and Car
denas to send lor his wounded soldiers,
he uid so in the evening, andninety-eieht
soldiers were carried to Guines on stretch
ers by a detachment sent for that purpose
by Aguilara, which was escorted by 100 in
surgents to the outskirts of the town.
By the same steamer which carries this
dispatch to Key West others relating to j
this affair are sent there to be cabled to
Madrid. Caustic comments are made by
the Spanish correspondents on the battle
in view of the reported pacification of
Havana province and all the western part
of the island. The first report in extenso
sent President McKinley by Calhoun with
regard :o the situation gees also by the
same steamer, and will be in Washington
on Tuesday. Up to this time Calhoun had
only cabled the President his general im
pressions after conferring with General
Lee.
COLOAEL AGUI RRE'B FATE.
One of the foulest Murder* in the JLi*t
Charoe'iblf! to ffeyler*
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 16.â A
private letter received to-day from one of
t lie United States Consuls in Cuba con
firms recent newspaper dispatches an
nouncing the killing of Colonel Carlos R.
Aguirre of the Cuban army by Spanish
troops. Accoid ng to the Consul's state
ment, Aguirre was a victim of murder as
I ioul as any in the lone list chargeable to
Weyler's rule. The Consul's letter, riated
May 7, says that Aguirre was killed la^t
week by a Spaniaid, and half alive was
dragged by the guerrilla with a rope
around his necK to General Obregon, wno
was ve:y ar.gry at the sight.
Aguirre was an American citizen who
had lived many years in this country.
His brothers, Colonel Felix and Monure,
were both killed in the previous Cuban
war and bis nephew, George Washington
Aguirre, was recently released from a
Cuban prison after many months' con
rinement, his case haviag been the sub
ject of a long debate in the Senate. A. A.
Aguirre, another brother of the murdered
oth'cer, who is one of the most active
friends of the Cuban cause in the United
States, is now in Washington and will call
tho attention of the President and the
Secretary of State to the inhuman circum
stances of his brother's death.
TUB li: ESI I) t:XTs KKEX IMBREST
Long Conference* at the White Rouse
That Are F.ao*r\y ' Watched.-
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 16.â
President gave much of his time to-day to
tte consideration of reports concerning
Cuban affairs and the consultation with
friends about the advisability of sending a
message to Congress recommending an
appropriation for the relief of distressed
American citizens in the poverty-stricken
island. .He bad a talk this morning ; with
Judge -Day,: who has had charge of the
compilation of extracts from telegrams
and other documentary evidence fur
nished by s Consul-General â¢ Lee ana the
consular ; officers. Judge Day called to
give the President all the information he
had received during the letter's absence in
Philadelphia. Alt of the telegrams telling
of the necessity Vof ; relief ; in the various
consular districts and a synopsis of the
mailed reports which Judge Day had pre
pared were left with the President for his
consideration. ' ? â  â¢
" The 'President must hay found the
Judge's : conversation interesting, t for he
stayed away from evening service to hear
what the Assistant Secretary of State had,
to tell. Another > visitor who came to give
the President bis views on tba question
was Representative Hitt of Illinois, chair
man of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
He was sent for by the President and
went to the White House about 9 o'clock.
They spent an hour togetner examining
the reports and discussing the necessity
for a message. When Hitt left no con
clusion in the matter had been reached.
Circumstances may alter the inclination
of President McKinley to send a com
munication to Congress. He is making
no secret of his position in the matter and
it was said to-night authoritatively, alter
the visit of Chairman Hitt, that the Presi
dent had not made up his mind regarding
the best course to pursue to give comfort
and security to American citizens suffer
ing from the havoc created by the war.
The President's idea is that a message
recommending a relief appropriation
would be a good thing, but there is no cer
tainty in his mind that he will send one
to Congress to-morrow. Not a line of
such communication has been written to
night. If it should be sent to both houses
at to-morrow's session it will be written
in the morning, and a decision to that
effect will cause the President to shut off
ail callers. The introduction of the Gal
linger resolution in the Senate appropri
ating $50,000 for the euccor of starving
Americans is the main reason for the
President's hesitation. As Spain has ex
pressed a willingness through her Minister
to furnish every facility for distributing
aid the President thinks that all that is
desired may be accomplished through the
Gailinjrer resolution. There is consider
able opposition, however, to this measure,
and it is doubtful whether it can be
adopted without being backed up by an
executive communication.

WASHINGTON, D. C. May 16.â A
very large and enthusiastic mass-meeting
of Cuban sympathizers was held at the
Columbia Theater this afternoon under the
auspices of the Woman's League. Senator
Gallinger made a ringing speech in favor
of Cuban independence. He thought, it

intervene in the barbarous war, and in
timated that the sending of an American
fleet into Havana harbor would have the

when he attempted to resume his seat
there were loud cries of "Go ahead; hit

Harry Arnett May Soon Pay
the Penalty for Killing
His Wife.
TRAGEDY IN THE MOUNTAIN
MINING TOWN.
The Victim a Fifteen-Year-Old Girl
Who Became a Bride Six
Months Ago.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 1<5.-One of tha
most fiendish murders in the history of
Calaveras County was committed at An
gela Camp this afternoon. Harry Arnett
shot his 15-year-old wile through the heart
and then brained her with a hatchet. Ar
nett is now in custody, but there is such,
strong taik of lynching that he ma/
pay the penalty for his crime before morn
ing. It has been almost impossible to hold
bact the men who are clamoring lor his
life.
The murderer is well known in Angels
Camp. He has been engaged in the candy
business there and has accumu
lated some money and property in the
famous mining lown. He is about 27 years
of age and has always been well regarded
by the citizens of Angels. Many months
ago he fell in love with the youthful
daughter of Mrs. Knight, who had resided
fora long time at Angels, but is now a
resident of Stent, another mining center.
The mother's consent was gained and last
December, although pretty Miss Knight
was but 14 years of age, she was united in
marriage to ihe man who murdered and
mangled her this afternoon.
Since the marriage the cbild-wife of the
caodyman has not, been happy, and there
have been frequent quarrels between her
and Arnett. This afternoon they were at
home, and with Mrs. Arnett was another
girl, her cousin. Words passed between
Arnett and his wife, and the quarrel
finally became so heated that she talked
of getting a divorce from him. At this
he grew frantic and threatened to kill his
wife, and when her cousin remonstrated
he threatened to take her life also. Be
coming more and more enraged, he drew a
revolver and fired at Mrs. Arnett. The
bullet entered her breast, and ranged
downward .near the heart. Not satisfied
with his work, the fiend seized a hatchet
and buried it in her brain. He again
threatened to kill the cousin, who, thor
oughly frightened, ran screaming from the
house and gave the alarm to the neigh
borhood. Arnett dragged the mutilated
body of his child-wife to the door, leaving
it there with the head on the doorsill. Ha
then fled.
When the screams of the cousin of the
murdered girl drew the attention of the
neighbors they hastened to the Arnett
house. The young wife was not dead, but
she passed away without gaining con
sciousness ten minutes later.
Instantly the citizens of Angels started
out to hunt for the murderer. He led
them a lively chase, but after a half hour
he was found where he had dropped from
loss of blood and exhaustion. He had
fired three bullets into his breast, but
none of the self-inflicted wounds are
necessarily fatal. He was taken into
kew to-day:
The camel is a beast of great strength
and endurance. Nothing hurts it until the
proverbial "last straw" is added to its
burden. The human digestive system is
very much like a camel. You can impose
on it to a wonderful degree. It is really as-
tonishing how much abuse it will stand
before it breaks down. "The last straw"
doenn't break it down, but it makes it stop
vrork. Continually put the wrong things
into your stomach, and digestion will get
weaker and weaker. Before long, some-
thing worse than usual will be eaten, and
will go through the stomach into the
bowels, and there it will stickâ that's con-
stipation. Let it continue, and there is noth-
ing bad that it will not lead to. Nine-tenths
of all human sickness is due to constipa-
tion. Some of the simplest symptoms are
coated tongue and foul breath, dizziness,
heartburn, flatulence, sallowness, distress
after eating, headaches and lassitude. A
little thing will cause constipation, and a
little thing will relieve it. Dr. Pierce s
Pleasant Pellets are a certain cure for con-
stipation. They are tiny, sugar-coated
granules, mild and natural in their action.
There is nothing injurious about them.

MAP OF THE SEAT OF WAR IN THESSALY.
This shows the country from the Findus Mountains to the Gulf of Volo, and from Phersala to Lamia and Thermopylae, with the Ortbrys Mountains; the several
passes therein, with the routes through them, and the line of Greek fortifications commanding the same; details of the scene of the late or of the probable future move
ments of either the Greek orTurkish army. The position of the Greeks at Dhomoko is a strong one, and were their forces even so nearly equal to those of the Turks as
to allow a proportionate number of men to be placed to euard the several important approaches to the fl.int and rear, the place would be difficult to carry, even with
odds. As it is, however, unless they can at once cover the passes in the Katalthloro Mountains. Tsamusi and Viiisotai on their left flanfe and Irakli and Kislse on the
right, the central position is not secure, as by any one of those routes the enemy can reach their flank or rear. The line of the old frontier along the crest of the high
Orthrys range offers them far greater strategic advantages. From Phourka west every pass through this rugged range is already guarded by strong permanent fortifica
tions, while those on the east, dv Antinitia and the Goura roÂ«te, are so high and difficult naturally as to render their defense by a small body of men an easy matter.
The three principal routes of approach from the north, including the highways from Phersala and Karditza, the only good roads on the whole line, converge at Phourka
Pass, whose strong permanent fortresses have been lately re-enforced by others. From Phourka west to Granitsa a road along the crest of the Makloukha Ridge connects
the tix fortresses guarding the several passes as well as a military telegraph line, enabling the rapid concentration of troops at any threatened point. This map was made
especially for The Call.
Angels, closely guarded, and his wounds
were attended to by physicians.
The news of the cold-blooded murder
soon spread over the mining town and
groups of miners and citizens gathered on
every corner. Many were for lynching
Arnett without further delay, while others
were for waiting to see whether the
wounds in his breast would prove fatal.
Late to-night it was reported by tele
phone from Angels that the excitement
had in a measure abated. Arnett had a
strong guard about him to prevent a
lynching. Sheriff Thorne of Calaveras
County had not yet arrived, but the offi
cers guarding the murderer did not be
lieve at that hour that there was any
danger of an immediate outbreak. At one
time after tne news of the killing became
known it seemed that nothing could save
Arnett from the infuriated men, but
tnoae who were the most anxious to string
Arnett up were persuaded to wait for fur
ther developments.
The wounds of the murderer have been
examined and found to be less dangerous
than was at first thought. He is liable to
survive and face the cousequences of his
crime.
JU is learned that the domestic life of
Arnett and nis young wife was unhappy
from the day of their marriage. Abont
two months ago she abandoned him and
went with her mother to Jamestown, in
Tuolumne County. There she remained
until about ten days ago, when she re
turned and had since been living with |
Arnett. They dad trouble a few nights
ago, though not of a nature to indicate
that the quarrel would lead to murder.
The immediate cau-e of the homicide was j
Arnett's jealousy. He bad a short time j
before intimated to friends that the con
duct of his wife was very unsatisfactory
and that she was too much in the com
pany of other men.
There are still knots of angry citizens on
the streets, but it is not likely that they

following extract from another letter
â¢from Rockhill to another Cuban Consul
was read : "Hereafter mark report 'confi
dential,' co that if the consular report? are
demanded by the Senate they need not be
.given to the Senators."
Senator Allen spoke sarcastically of the
vacillating attitude of Sherman, saving
that two years ago he was Cuba's friend ;
now be refrained from committing him
self "because he was afraid that our com
mercial relations with Spain might be
crippled."
"If," shouted the Nebraska Senator at
the top of his voice, "the United States
Vould send a fleet into Havana harbor,
the Cuban war would end within thirty
days. It would not be necessary to fire a
ohot, either. There must be no war upon
womanhood, no war upon hospitals and
sick beds, and no war upon the children
and upon the mothers of the island."
iie said the war was prolonged for the
benefit of a few sugar planters, who were
reaping a veritable harvest. The foreign
policy of the United States was a disgrace
to every American, Alien thought, and at
limes he felt ashamed that he lived under
the American nag.
Ex-Senator Butler of South Carolina
offered a resolution declaring it to be the

be free, and it was carried by a unanimous
rising vote.

The following year, 1895, the club divided
into twelve separate parties, and each
ascended one of the high peaks in the
chaic of mountains from British Columbia
to Mexico, and at the same moment sig
naled with heliographs from one to the
other. On account of the rainy condition
of the weather, however, the experiment
j in which the Government was deeply in
terested and for which it had furnished
instruments, was not wholly successful.
In spoaking of the arrangements for the
club's expedition this summer, Steele said: !
â¢'I have conic East to complete che de
tails incident to our excursion the present
summer, which we hope to make more
noteworthy in the hisiory of tne club.
We shall have with us twelve sclentiik j
men from Washington, representins vari
ous departments of the National Govern
ment. The Weather Bureau has sent in
struments to be used in flying kites from
the summit of Ranier, and we have in
vited Gilbert T. Woglom of thi3 city to fly
his kites for us and take aerial photo
graphs. We shall leave Portland July 19
! and return Auxust 1. We shall camp
j fourteen days at Paradise I\irk at the line
of perpetual snow. It will take three days
to make the ascent of the mountain. One
night we Bhall spend on the side of the
mountain, one in the crater and one in
camp. We shall take heliographic obser
vations and fly the American flag with
kites from the top of the mountain from a
greater heicht than our National emblem
has ever flown before. With thÂ« helio
graphs we shall commu.iicate with Port

I expect to make the expedition one of es
pecial pleasure to the organization and of
scientific value fo the world."
The Mazamas Club, which takes its
name from the peculiar goat discovered
'200 years ago by Spanish settlers along

VERDICT OF SUICIuI RENDERED.
But It Is Believed That Nelson B. Clark,
the "Bark K ng" of Michigan,
Was Murdered.
GRAND RAPIDS. Mj.ru., May 16 âIt
was decided by the Coroner in Milwaukee
yesterday that Nelson B. Clark, the "bark
king" and president of the Michigan Bark
and Lumber Company, the heaviest
operators in hemlock bark in the country,
who w;:s found dead there on the street,
bad committed suicide, but the indications
point to murder.
Clark left here Wednesday for Mil
waukee, and on Friday telegraphed he
wou.'d be home the next day. Instead of
coming home, news was received of his
death. When found he was fully dresse;!.
By his side was a rovolver with six cham
bers empty. There was tÂ» wound in the
breast near the heari and another in the
abdomen, and the clothing at both places
was slightly scorched. The lapel of the
coat was scorched and there was a ragged
cut on tiie right hand. It is the theory of
j W. D. Sntton, who brought the body to
j his home this morning, that a robber
j demanded Clark's money at the point of a
revolver and that Clark struck the revolver
up, cutting his hand with the blow and
I caus'iig it to discharge. The theory is
! sustained by the fact that only twenty
i five CMitÃ was in his pockets, while it is
â  known he had $100 or $125. ClaiK always
carried a loaded revolver with him, and
this revolver was found in his v;ilise at
the hotei.

Brown, whom a mob threatened to lynch
last night for the murder of Mrs. Stone on
Saturday morning, has managed to secure
a few days' more life through the inter

the victim. Stone is not certain of the
negro's guilt, as he thought his confession
war secured by playing upon his fear.
The 2000 people who surrounded the jail

however, that they; would lynch Brown
later if his guilt should bo proven. The

Wreck of the German Steamer
Arcadia and Thrilling Rescue

ST. JOHNS, N. F., MÂ»y IG.â Two more
marine disasters have occurred on the
sou;h coast of Newfoundland within the
past thirty-six hours. Yesterday morn
ins in a dense fog tha French brigantine
Croisine, from Bayonne for St. Pierre,
went ashore near Samaline, twenty miles
from her destination. A heavy sea was
running and her scars came tumbling to
the deck, breaking one man's arm and
seriously injuring two others. The waves
made clean breaches over the vessel, car
j rying away the bulwarks and deck gear.
I Thecrew had to lash themselves to me
mast stumps and poop to escape being
swept over.
After two hours they launched the boats.
Twenty-seven men were crowded into
them. They were unable to take any pro
visions owing to the vessel being filled
with water, and for a whole day and night
and until noon to-day they rowed and
drifted about the ocean, the fog being so
thick that nothing was visible. They
finally heard the St. Pierre whistle and
contrived to enter that port, worn out,
doaked through and famished.
One boat was stove in when putting oil
and only incessant bailing kept her afloat.
Many of the men were frostbitten.
Another wreck < ccurred in the fog this
morning at Cape Ray. The German
steamer Arcadia, grain laden from Mon
treal for England, crashed into a shelving
rock. Her forehold was full of water and
her bottom probably pierced by jagged
rocks. Her fifty seamen and tweniy-five
passengers crowded on the forecastle
while the boat slowly settled and four
strong swimmers essayed to reach shore
w:th lines. After some hours they suc
ceeded. A hawser was then attached and
all those aboard were rescued.

LIVE IN FEAR OF
PIUTE VENGEANCE
Terror Still Possesses
Mexican Residents
of Bagdad.
Believe the Death of Ahvote
Has Not Placed Whites
Out of Danger.
Others of Murdered Chief Moss'
Tribe May Go Upon the
Warpath.
SAN BERNARDINO. Cal., May 16.â
It is feared by the Mexican residents of
Bugdari that the death of Ahvote, the
Piute botcher, has not ended the blood
shed in that vicinity. Sheriff Holcorub
remains in the town to guard against In
dian treachery ana to lend courage to the
Mexicans who have not alrei:d\" fled
across the border to escape the fiatea.
Their alarm is not shared by Americans
at Bagdad, the latter believing that the
crimes of Ahvote were not inspired by his
tribe in a spirit of revenge, but were
rather the deeds of a crazy Indian bent on
murdering every one he met.
Later information from the several
tribes of Piutes is to the effect that they
are on the verge of an internal war caused
by feuds between their chiefs. From
Caliente came word several days a?o that
actual hostilities had broken out and that
several Indians had been killed.
Mexican treachery and cupidity were
responsible for the Ahvote rampage,
which cost the lives of at least ten whites.
John Moss, a Piuto Indian chief, wont to
Bagdad on February 25 from a ranch on
which he was working. He had the pro
ceeds of three months' labor in his pock
ets, and on arriving sought to buy liquor
in the Stewart Hotel barroom. He was
refused. Leaving the hotel he met two
Mexicans, John Nunez and Gre^orio
Rede. He asked their advice as to the
best means of procuring liquor. Under
the pretense that they would buy it for
him he was induced to visit the cabin of
Antonio Fraucesca, a Mex.c.mcoalheaver,
who lived near thÂ« coal chutes, among
which are scattered a number of Indian
shacks. Once there he displayed about
$70 in cash, and Rede determined to ob
tain it. Moss was filled with cheap red
wine and became hilarious. Rede, who is
known as a bad man among the Mexicans,
picked a quarrel with Moss anil then re
tired 10 ihe outside of the cabin. The row
was continued inside, and finally Fran
cesca led Moss to the door.
Rede, who bad preceded the Indian, se
cured an ax that lay near by and as Moss
emerged deliberately struck him on the
Head and killed him. He took what
money Moss had, and then France sea and
Nunez, under tbreata from Rede ; helped
to drag the body some 200 yards in a cir
cuitous route and hide it among chapar ral
bushes ne:ir the raiiroad track.
Moss' wife had missed him from the
ranch and going post haste to Bagdad
found that her husband had been there
and was last seen alive going to Frances
ca'i cabin In company w;th Rede and
Nunez. At the cabin she could get no re
plies to her questions, and knowing that
her husband had money sue raised a com
nio:ion that resulted in a search for Moss
by a posse of citizens and the finding of
His body secreted in the dense under
brush.
On learning that her husband had been
murdered the squaw proceeded to where
her pony was nitched. "Nevermind," ahe
exclaimed, "Piutehave good law â life for
life, "and with these threatening words she
started back to the ranch.
Her attitude and language alarmed the
Mexicans of Bagdad and they sougnt se
curity in the coal bunktr3 of the Atlantic
and Pacific Company, wherein they fori
lied themselves strongly. The county offi
cers at this city were notified, and Siierilf
Holcombe and his deputies went out and
arrested all the persons implicated in the
crime. They were brought to San Bernar
dino and indicted, and Fn.nctsca, turning
State's evidence, told his story, with the
result that Rede was convicted of murder
in the second degree and h now serving a
life sentence la San QumiUii. Nunez
pleaded guilty to having been an accessory
after the fact aud received a live-years'
sentence.
This did not satisfy the Piutes. They
demanded a life for that of their chief,
and when the trial was over they sought
their homes silent and sullen. Tho.-e
who know them and their nature best pre
dicted trouble with them, and that they
were riebt events of the past few days
have proved.
On Thursday night word was brought
into The Needles that the Fiute Ahvote
was on the warpath, and in his raids had
killed four prospectors along the Colorado
River, one of whom was a brother of M.
Monaghan of The Needles. A posse was
organ iz *d, and striking across the river
into Arizona took uu the tnil of the rene
eade. Ou the marc ; they mot a China
man, wno said that no had almost been a
victim of Ahvote, his color alone saving
him, as the Indian seemed bentonslay
ine white men only. It was also learned
that he had added two more to his list,
making six in all.
Seeking a place where it was known
that about fifty Indians were camped the
avengers notified them that if Ahvote was
not killed they would destroy every In
dian in the section. From among the
redskins they selected tea trailers and the
man hunt became more exciting.
It was found that Ahvote crossed and
recrossed the river, slaying all who hap
pened in his path. He added four more
victims to his list, three of whom were
unknown. His victims as far as known
are: Lari Franzen and Ben Jones, team
sters; Christian NeUsOfl and Charles
Monaghan, miners; Judj;e J. M. Morton,
an assayer an a millman, known all over
the coast; John Powers and Conley, mine
owners, and three men, names unknown.
With the Indian trailers the whites
pressed on ana overtaking the murderer
in El Dorndo Canyon the Indians am
bushed him and shot him to death.
Leaving hi-* body where it fell they re
turned to The Needles and found iha
place in mourning because of the mur
ders.

DOUBLE TRAGEDY AT TACOMA.
On a Street Crowded With Church-Goers
John UcCarty Kills His Wile
. and Himself.
TACOMA. Wash.. May 16 âWith a ;
merry lau?h still echoing from his lips
John A. McCarty, a railroad -man, turned ]
and shot his wife through the head, kill
ing her instantly, ana then killed himself.
The shooting occurred about noon to-day
on a street near St. Leo's Church and was
witnessed by a score of people. : ;
The McCartys had of late been living in ;
Spokane, but for the last week the wife
was visiting her mother. Mrs. McAtee, in
this city. Mrs. McCarty and Mrs. McAtee
attended mass at St. Leo's Church and were
returning in the direction of Mrs. Mc-
Atee^ home when they were joined by
McCarty. who they did not know was in
the city. They walked on together for j
several blocks, Mr. and Mrs. McCarty ap- I
pearing light-hearted and at Deuce with I
each other. Suddenly McCarty stopped
and without a word of warning placed a
revolver close to hi 3 wife's ear and fired.
The bullet struck her in the temple and
he fell without a word. The mother,
with a cry of anguish, threw herself upon
her daughter's body.
McCarty swung around once or twice as
though dazed by what le had done, and |
then placed the revolver to his head and
fired. His aim was unsteady and the bul
let went through his hat. On the B'cond
attempt he sent a bullet through his brain
and fell dead.
Mrs. .McCarty and her husband were
married eight years ago in Tacoma. For
a long time McCarty was employed here
as a switchman on the Northern Pacific
Railroad, ana he afterward worked on the
Seattle, Lake Shore, and Eastern Railroad
at Seattle. Kb jut a year ago he became
afflicted wit:i lung trouble, and a. doctor
advised him to go to California. He went
to Los Angeles with his wife and iwo chil
dren, but his health did not improve and
he returned and went to Spokane, where
bis brother, T. J. McCarty, lived.
Here he was unable to obtain work, and
he grew despondent, taking to drink. His
appetite for liquor grew, ana about two
weeks ago bis wife angered him in her
efforts to nave him cease drinking. The !
next day, however, both were sorry and
the trouble was patched up. It was with
loving expressions of regret that McCarty
bade his wife and little son, Ray, good-bv,
when she left Upokane to visit her mother.
Their daughter, Ethel,* remained with
him. - -".â¢ ' : â  ' ; -' V â¢." â¢
McCarty hnd learned of a position In
Montana, and was going to lake it, so it
was with surprise, but with a light heart,
that Mrs. McCarty greeted her husband
in front of the church, little dreaming of
what was to come. McCarty . must have
come with a fixed determination to kill
his wife and himself, nx he purchased tip

Horrible Ending of a Drunken
Orgle In Which Both Were
Principals.
SALINAS, Cal., May 16.â The town of
Castroville is in a turmoil of excitement ]
over an atrocious murder committed near
there last night. Miss Perez of Casiro
ville was tne victim, and her brother-in
law, Wiiiiam Cole of Santa Cruz, is now
in the Saiinas jail awaiting an examina- i
tion on the charge of having taken her
life. The crime was the sequel to a
drunken orgy in which both had figured
as principals earlier in the evening.
Coie, ff.no lives apart from his wife,
was brought to Salinas yesterday by Con
stable Church, cnarged with abandoning !
his child. He was released on bail, an* i
about 7 o'clock in the evening left Salinas i
for Caslroville in a carriage, in company |
with Nick Umbertez, whose acquaintance I
he had that day formed in towu. He dis- j
covered that Umbertez was an old friend
of his \vi:e, and he toot him along for the
purpose of conciliating her and to urge
her to dismiss the charge iodged against
aim.
They arrived at the home of his wife at
9 o'clock. Mis-s Perez, a sister of Mrs. |
Cole, and the latter's two little children j
were at the house. Coie asked for his wife j
and was told that she was visiting neigh
bors. He offered Mi3S Perez a drink of
whisky from a partly emDtieJ bottle that j
he had procured in Salinas. She accepted, |
and after several exchanges cf compli

then prevailed upon Umbertez to go and
procure another bottle. Umbertez went,
accompanied by Miss Perez,
During their absence Mrs. Ida Cole, the
wife of the accused man, returned. Um
benez and Miss Perez came back shortly
with the whisky, which the company soon
consumed. Coie suggr-sted to his wife
that they drive to Salinas, saying that |
there was a show in town. She refused j
and upbraided him because of his drunken ;
condition. He tben nskei Miss Perez to
take a short drive, and she consented.
. They left the house at about 10 o'clock, j
When driving through the main street of !
Castroviiie, toward Moss Landing, Cole i
stopped and proenred another flask of i
whi-ky.
Wnat happened from this time on until |
2:45 o'clock Cole does not remember â 
c. early. One fact alcne is clear in his 1

of the buggy and that h<Â« assisted her back !
with great difficulty, she being limp aa a
rag.
Cole arrived at his wife's house at 3
o'clock and was met at the gete by his I
wife and Umberiez. Hia wife's first ex- j
clama.ion was:
"You have killed my sister!' 1

THE* SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 17, 1897.
LANE COUNTY, OR.
By F. M. Wilklns, President of the Board of Trade of Eugene.
EUGENE, Ob., May 13 âLane County
occupies the center of Western Oregon,
having a frontage on the Pacific Ocean of
twenty-five mi es and extending eastward
150 miles to the summit of the Cascade
Mountains, with an average width of for
ty-five miles. It has a population of
about 18,000, or less than three persona to
the square mile.
One of the chief features of any and all
countries is climate. It is this that makes
the difference between the desert and the
garden. Lane County has a* climate that
is as near perfection as can be found any
where. The greatest complaint against
the country lying to the north of us is
"too much rain," and a strong objection
to that lying to the south is "too much
drouth," but Lane County, Or., lying be
tween these two extremes, enjoys the ben
efits of a happy medium, having just
enough ot both sunshine aud rain to in
sure good crops and good health. No irri
gation is needed for any crop. Temper
ature ranges within moderate bounds,
giving no sudden changes. SummÂ°r
nights are invariably cool enough to re
quire one or more blankets for'comfort.
Lowest tewperature ever recorded at Eu
gene, 4 degrees below zero; higlieat tem
perature, 98 degrees.
The average rainfall is about thirty-six
inches.
The county has 162 school districts in
which free public schools are maintained
from three to nine months in the year.
The leading industries of the county are
divided into wheat raising, hop culture,
fruit raising, lumberinsr, mining, salmon
canning, stocc raiting and dairying.
Wheat raising in Lane County, with
proper culture, yields from twenty to sixty
bushels to the acre, and the uÂ«ual crop of I
tne county is 500,000 bushels. Oats, barley,
corn, clover and timothy do well.
Hop culture is one of the leading indus
tries, about 1800 acres being cultivated in i
the county. The average yield is 1500
pounds to the acre and the average price
is 12 cents per pound. There is still much
good' bop land awaiting cultivation, to be
bought for $20 to $50 per acre.
The new mining camps of Bohemia and I
Blue River, in Hie eastern part of the â 
county, are rapidly being developed into
paying properties, four or five quartz mills j
being already in operation, wit:i five to j
twenty stamps each, employing- about 300
bands at wages from f 1 !V0 to $4 a day.
Lumbering is Assuming large propor
tions in Lane County. Over one-third its j
territory is covered with ap enormous
growth of milling timberâ chiefly Orfeon
t>ineâ estimated to yield 25 000 to 50,000
feet per acre. Twenty-vwo mills are now
engaged in cutting lumber, giving era- :
ployment to a larce number of handÂ«. J
With this vast area of timber, practically j
untouched, the lumbering business of this
county is only in its infancy. Timber
lands can be bought ior $2 to $10 per acre,
and there is still room and opportunity
for new mills.
Fruit-raising in Lane County is al?o as
suming large proponions. There are 1500
to 2000 acres of rrune and cherry trees now
large enough to bear the crop of 1897 Our
fresh fruit goes to Chicago, New York,
Boston and all other large cities in car
load lots, and bring prices that leave the
producer large profits. This profit varies
according to care and culture of trees,
j adaptability of soil and locality, marfcp:
price and busineÂ»s management, from $50
per acre at five years old to $4<K) Der acre
at full growth. From the time a young
orcnard is set out until it begins to bear
for market the ground between the trees
can be cultivated to vegetables or small
iruits or stocked with poultry at good
profit. The profits in fruit culture here
are remarkable, some single trees yielding
as high as $40 in one ssason.
Salmon canning is a leading industry at
Florence, near the seaconst, the annual
product selling at about $40,000.
Four or five creameries are in success
ful operation in the county and more are
being built.
Cattle, sheep, hogs and Angora goats
are all successfully and profitably raised.
The bills and mountains furnish abund
ant free range, as nearly one-half the
county is still unoccumert Government
and railroad land. Angora goats, intro- !
duced in this county some years ago,
have been found very profitable in the
foothill and brush y sections. Their nio
bair brines from 20 to 35 cents per pound,
the climate seems to suit them and they
are very useful in clearing land, as they
destroy all brush within their reach, thus
aiding materially in bringing the w:ld
land into cultiva.ion.
Taxation is reasonable, bfing 17 mills
total for 1896 for State, scnoo! and county
purposes, ami 15 iihjls for the year 1f97.
The county has no bonded indebtedness
and warrants are going ai a premium.
The city of Jfingene, situated about the
center of the county, at the he*tl of steam
boat, navigation on the Willamette River,
is the largest trade center in the county
and the fourth city in population in the
State. It is tiis seat of the Oregon State
University, and therefore the educational
center of thÂ« State. Eugene is pre-emi
nently a home city, having a population
oi 4500. It in locat- don the main line of
the tsouihern Pacific lailway leading from
Portland, Or., to ban Francisco, Cal., anil
thus with Doth railroad and river steam
ers has excellent ' transportation fa
cilities. Including immediate suburbs
it has the following factories in
active operation: Two sawmills, two
gristmills furniture factory, sash and
door factory, soap factory, tool-handle fac
tory, shotgun factory, loundry and ma
chine-shop, tannery and steam laundry.
It has three Danks, good stores, Western
Union and Postal telegraph connection
and long-distance telephone connection
with all the leading cities of the North
west, A'so has good electric light and
water systems and streetcars, sewer,
creamery", three weekly and one daily
newspapers, nine churches, two fine,
graded schools an J a.l the leadine benev
olent societies of the age. In addition to
the above enterprises already in success
ful operation Eugene has excellent facili
ties for large manufacturing in certain
lines, it has available water power, de
valoped and undeveloped to the extent of
15,000 horsepower.
The finest blankets made in the United
States are those manufactured in the Wil
lamette Valley. Cheap water power,
abundance of suitable timber and straw,
make Eugene wÂ°U adnpted for paper
manufacturing. Eugens will welcome
and substantially encourage both of the
above enterprise, us well as any other
manufacturing likely to succeed. It is
also a favorable location for a beet-sugar
iactorv, a* the farm land in this vicinity
has been tested and found to pioJuce
sugar beets of high grade. Eugene has a
most favorab'e situation for a Jaree city.
It has a country trade extending for fiity
miles on the west and 25U miles on the
east. Eugene is well supplied with hotels.
The Hoffman is the first-class house,
where speaal attention is given the tour
ist and commercial trade.
STANFORD'S CHIEF PREACHES
" The Urnamed Church" the Subjfct of a
Sermon on Religion by Dr.
Jordan.
BTANFORD UNIVERSITY. May 16.â
President David S. Jordan delivered the
sermon in the chanel this morning. He
spoke on "The Unnamed Church," and in
substance ssid :
From Paul's letter to the Ephesians I tate
these words: "Let all bitterness and wrath
and anger and clamor and railing be put away
trom you with all malice, autf be ye kinil to one
another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other.
Let no man deceive you with empty words,
walk as childien of lisht, for the fruit of light
is in all goodness and righteousness and
truth."
When this university wa* founded it wp.s
| provided that in its religious life, as in its
I scientific investigations, H should be wholly
! free from outside control; no religious sect i>r
' organization end no group of sects should
1 have dominion over it. la other words, me
| university should exist lor its own snke, to
I carry out its own purposes and to bring about
Us own results in its own way.
The function of the university is to help
men and women to make the most of them
selves in every wayâ physically, mentally,
morally, spiritually. It cannot then Ignore
religious training, lor religion forms the axis
of personal character, and the development of
character is the prime element of success in
life.
Religions development rests on obedience.
To fear God is to shun eviL But it is easier to
obey man than God. The comrnondments of
man can be written out in the form of cere
monies and observance;. These can be ensily
followed and understood. To ob-y God one
must go behind all conventionalities of rann
to read his commandments each for himself.
These are not the same as the commandments
of the vigibie church, which must consider
not only the growth of the man, but the
growth of tne organization, and the needs of
the man may sometimes be sacrificed to the
needs of the organization.
Mauv have condemned the universities of
the world because they do not stand rs terv
ants of the visible church. Some of this con
demnation has fallen on us at Palo Alto. Be
cause we are not under the sway of some re
ligious society men have seid we are without
religion.
In this regard the die is cast once for all.
The choice of the founders of this university
was deliberate and final. They chose the patn
of intellectual and religious ire<Â»dom in the
very interest of religion itself. They believed
that freedom of thought nn<i i-ctiou would
promote morality and relicion; that a deeper,
fuller religious life would come from the
growth of the individual; that only wlien the
winds of freedom were blowing would come
the highest lype of religious development.
For character is formed from within by tho
efforts and strivings and aspirations of the in
dividual. It cannot beimposed irom without.
The will is made str*." 1 * from choosing the
rtght, not from having light action impressed
upon it. The life ot man is "made beautiful
and sweet through self-devotion and through
self-restraint," but this must bs chosen volun
tarily because tt iÂ» good.
The word ' -religion" is used in many senses
and on the definition we adopt depends the
truth of whatever we may say about it. What
I choose to call religion is devotion in action.
It is devotion to the highest thoughts; it is
determination to do the highest deeds; it is
the inspiration of right-doing, the impulse to
choose the best acts possible to us because we
Know them to be the best. Hence the highest
religion is the individual, and being the out
growth of the individual human soul ii is in
perpetual protest against the forms and ob
servances and ronventionaltiesoi the religion.
We have a right to rec aim the word "re
ligion" from its wDsolete meaning. It is not a
word for 'vrauts, bigots and sentimentalists.
It is a robust word, instinct with life. It does
uot mean mere docility, ob-jdlence to all com
mands, whatever their credentials. It does
not mean bigotry and intolerance, which are
the cvii sides of self-righteousness and self
conceit, which it is the part of religion to dis
place. Religion is cot mere sentimentalism,
either quiet or spasmodic. It is a matter of
leeiing, only as feeling leads forward to deeds.
It is to be tested every day by its fruits, by its
Â» ffect on tlie formation of character ana its
service to other men.
Religion is not a matter of Sabbaths and
priests and churches. It belongs no more to
the first day of the week than to any other of
the seven. Iti* satisfied witn no part r.f the
life; with no corner oi the soul, ltmusthave
h!1 or nothing, and all times and all places are
its alike. Tue man who is essentially religious
remains so on all days, in all things which he
uoss, in all conditions of life. All dHys are
saints' days to the reve-ent man. Changes
of â  ceremonies, changes of creed are no more
than changes of garment. They clo noi affect
the inner nature of a man, for vital Religion
must be above ail temporary conditions. "Re
ligion," a wise man has said, "must include
tiie heart, the intellect and tne conscience."
These are the three characteristics of the
higher liie: Sweetness, light and strenzth.
The character of man is built up by doing
day by da/ the very best he knows. His el
iectiveness, his power for good, asks more
ihan this. He must do the best that can be
known. Only Hie best tha; is possible can
survive. Evil and lolly cennoi hurt the
woria. They leave no permanent mark upon
ii. It is as strong and clean to-day us though
never a deed of blood or stintne had been
wrought in human history. But the strength
oi man may leave iis impression on the old
earth itself. It is God's impress wrought by
human hands. The conscience of man is a
iactor in human development.
To train men to do the best they know has
been the functions of the historic church. To
train men to do^e bfst that can be known is
the duty of the university. To this end heart
and brain and conscience must work together.
Tnet pach should be strong each must grow in
freedom.
Eacn day Goi renews the work of creation.
Every day and in-tantly he makes fresh de
mands upon man. It is the funcion of le
iiKion to respond to taesa demands. It is the
hunger of the soul tnnt cannot be stifled and
will not be satistied with husks. That which is
real must deal with realities, and the test of its
development will be found in sweetness, en
lightenment and effectiveness.

STOCKTON, Cal., May 16 âThe finest

DUNKARDS SIT AT
SOLEMN BANQUET
The Annual Last-Supper
Ceremony Observed
at Lordsburgr.
Men and Women of the Sect
Silently Wash Each
Other's Feet.
Strange Rites In Accord With Those
of the Christ and His
Apostles.
POMONA, Cal., May laâ Last night
was the most important in the calendar of
Dunkards, and the little village of Lords
burg, m Pomona Valley, was thronged by
people. According to Punkard reckoning,
Christ was crucified in the early weeks of
May. The church observes at that time
the annual last-supper and feet-washing
ceremonies, following more literally the
scenes in the last hours of the Saviour
than does any denomination in America.
These annual ceremonies took place at
Lordsburg last nin lit.
Lordsburg is the only large Dunkard
colony in California or west of Kansas.
There are over 600 in this region, and
all gathered at the meeting yesterday.
A host of people of other and of no re
ligious beliefs went to Lordsburg lrom
all parts of Pomona Valley to witness the
strange ceremonies of this religious sect.
For days they had been in preparation.
Houses had been cleaned, the family
washing done for weeks in advance, and
all cooking necessary for three days had
been religiously performed.
The Dunkards in their sable garb as
sembled yesterday afternoon in a large
upper hall that they call their tabernacle.
The room is divided by a railing that runs
lengthwise of the apartment. The m- n
took seats on one side ana the women on
the other. No more serious audience ever
congregated.
For two hours Elder Pennington
preached upon the sacredness of the anni
versary. Then followed an hour of silent
prayer, and men and women sank on their
knees in awing silence and remained
there with bent heads until Elder Pen
nington announced that devotions were
over.
At 8 o'clock last evening the Dunkards
reassembled in the tabernacle for the last
service. They came in silence and alone.
No one spoke and no children were
brought to utter childish prattle. Every
thing was done to follow closely upon the
gospel description of the last supper
and scenes of Christ with his disciples.
Great tables with snowy white clothes had
been set in the hall, and there were about
them hundreds of seats. Tne scene was
intensely solemn and the most irreverent
onlookers could but be impressed. At
B:3oo'cldck 200 men, all in the plainest
black garb and wearing long beards had
arrived and over 300 women in the sim
plest black gowns and bonnets of black
with a little white at the front.
For half an hour all were on their knees
in Â§ilent prayer. Occasionally sobs and

moans were heard from those more deeply
moved. Then Eider Pennington ross and
said:
"Let as do as the Master did."
Half a dozen foot-tubs partly filled with
water were brought, together with a pilo
of towels. The tubs were equally divided
among the men and women, wno set
apart from each other. While several
patriarchal men put towels about their
waists as aprons several women uid like*
wise. Then each man with an apron took
a tub in hia hands and went and kissed
some other man on the lips and knelt at
the other's feet. He removed the other
man's shoes, turned up his trouser-legs
and ceremoniously washed bis feet. Then,
when he had dried the feet with tho
towel, he again kissed the man and saluted
him. saying:
.â 'This we do in memory of our Master."
Then that man who-'e feet had been
washed girded himself with the apron and
nimself performed the foot-bashing cere
mony. So they went on from one man to
another for over an hour.
Meanwhile the women were likewise
kis-in;, saluting and washing one an
other's feet. It was all done solemnly,
save for the splashing of water, the kiasei
and the subdued word* of salutation no
bounds were heard. All the spectators
were awed to silence at the strange scene.
After a long period of silent prayer the
communion of bread and wine was ob
served. Then came the observance of the
last supper. Baskets of plates and forks
and spoons and Knives were brought in
and arranged on the table. Then came
dishes of cold staple foods, anch as roast
beei, pork and beam, bread and water.
Supper was eaten without a word spoken
and one heard only the rattle of knives
and forks. Each person had been ex
horted to remember the meaning of tho
supper.
Then, following the description of the
Lord's last supper, the Dunkards rose to
their feet at a given signal and with
bowed^eads sang two verses of a sacred
hymn and went out of the hall and home
wituout another word escaping their lips.
At home the greater part of them re*
mained in silent prayer all last night.
PACIFIC GROVE ENCAMPMENT.
Cadets of St Mat/iew's School Engage
in a Com pa tit isb Drill for a
Medal.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., May 16.â 0n
account of the sham battle on Friday aft
ernoon, which lasted longer than was an
ticipated by the officers, the competitive
driil between the two companies of St.
Mathew's School Cadets encamped here
was postponed until yesterday. At the
appointed time Lieutenant Herrion of
Company A marshaled his company be
fore the reviewing stand and the cadeis
presented armi to the judges, who were:
Major Andrew Kirk, U. S. A., the com
mandant of the encampment; Captain M.
P Seeley, U. S. A., and Lieutenant A. W.
Jones Jr. of the Old Capital Cadets. The
company was then put through a series of
maneuvers and the manual of arms, ac
cording to a programme arranged by the
judges, but the weakness of the company
showed in lack of precision in executing
the commands and imperfections in align
ment.
When Company B, commanded by
Lieutenant Johnson, came forward to go
through the same maneuvers the large
crowd of spectators saw immediately tbat
there was not the slightest doubt as to the
result of the contest, for from the very
first Company B's drill was executed with
an alertness and uniformity that was ex
cellent in every particular, and the boys
fully merited the heany commendations
wtoich were showered upon them.
Alter the drill the battalion was formed

The first notable result of the establish

combination of Chicago and St. Louis to
pool their issues and go for the big
metropolis like a thousand of brick.
Now that tho New Yorkers have their

they made it bo big.
If. the increased duty on Deer is not

The large number of girls who have
arrived in New York to seek employment
in domestic service is all right from some
points of view, but where is the chance of

The merchants of New York are said to
have been so pleased with tha increase of
retail business caused by the influx of
visitors to attend the Grant celebration
that they are now trying to get up a move

Bide drive for all the deceased dignitaries
in the country.
Amid all tie adverse criticisms of ths
way in which she treated her invited
guests at the Grant monument dedication,
hew York has one consolation : S:r Juliau
Pauncefote has written a letter cordially
thanking the city for its generous and
courtly hospitality. It is â well understood,
of course, that Sir Ju.ian has a great
reputation for diplomacy.
A New York clubman entertained thirty
guests at a supper at which nothing was
served but beefsteak and beer, and yet,
according to the New York Pre*!>, the bill
amounted to |93 97, or more than $3 a

beef must be very high in trie Eastern
metropolis, or else the New York capacity
for beer is something to astonish a West

The railway across the Andet, which it

line, and we may profit by it in California
if we develop our South American trade
with proper enterprise and sagacity.
It is announced that the "Zoo" in Cen
tral Park, New York, has been increased
by the addition of a military monkey, a
horned owl and a kinkajou. The military
monkey was doubtless leftover from the
staff of some Governer after the Grant
parade, the horned owl could have been
easily gathered in from the tenderloin on
the night after the procession, but from
whence came the kinkajou, or what is his
other name, are things we cannot even
guesc at.
McKINLEY AND CUBA.
The expected message from the Presi
dent on the condition of affairs in Cuba is
the chief object of interest at the capital
at this time. No one looks for anything
sensational or aggressive, but there is an
earnest hope that the President sÂ«es some
way of putting an end to much of the evil
that is now being wrought in Cuba and
will be able to submit to Congress a plan
for accomplishing that greatly desired re
sult.
For some days the reports from Wash
ington have been full of rumors more or
less authentic of the facts upon which the
President would base his message and of
guesses at the conclusions he would draw
from them, i'heso have dealt with stories
of wrong done to American residents in
tne island and with the sufferings they
have undergone. It seems to be the gen
eral belief in Washington that the Presi
dent will urge Congress to take some
action for the relief ot at least the Amer
ican citizens who have lost their property
during the war and who are now in many
cases destitute of the necessaries of life.
Whether he will go further and recom
mer.d some inteiference or mediation on
our part to put an end to the war alto
gether is not clearly known, and it is the
uncertainty on that important point that
makes the subject one of such universal
interest.
It is satisfactory to note that even in
this uncertainty in regard to the exact
policy the administration will urge upon
Congress no one feels the least uneasiness
or anxiety. The people have confidence
in the wisdom as well as in tne patriotism
of the Presdent and his advisers. We
have no longer an un-American admin
istration to rnanase our foreign affairs.
The country therefore awaits the coming
message with interest, but without any
symptoms ot a war scare, or any fears
that the welfare of our citizens abroad will
be sacriliced through indifference to their
claims or to rough subservience to Span
ish influences.
It would be indeed most gratifying to
the country if the message should disclose
some means of action on our part by
which this cruel, wasteful and useless
war could be promptly closed. Cuba is so
c!o3e to our shores and so much a part of
our geographical system tbat her welfare
cannot be wholly separated from ours.
We lose much in the way of valuable
trade by every month of the war, and,
moreover, the continuance of the struggle
entails a considerable expense upon our
Government to prevent filibusters and
shipments of arms to the Cubans. We
have, therefore, interests in the struggle
which jui-tify our interference if we deem
it advisable to do so.
The American people desire to keep the
peace with Spain and intend to fulfill
toward her all the duties of one nation to
another, but we cannot permit the Cuban
war to go on forever, and for tbat reason the
administration would find a cordial sup
port from men of all parties if it should
outline a policy which would promise an
end to the struggle and the Independence
of Caba.
EEVENUE PROM TEA.
The proposition that a revenue of
$10,000,000 bs raised by placine an import
tax of 10 cents a pound on tea has led to
no little discussion, and as a result the
public is receiving a good deal of light on
some cf tha inner mysteries of the tea
trsde.
The removal of the duty on tea, we are
told, did not benefit the consumer a par
ticle, for tho selling pries remains the
same as before and the quality of the tea
imported has greatly deceased. The
consumption, moreover, has declined
since the removal from L 52 to 1.34 pounds
per capita, and it is argued that the de
cline was caused by the removal of tho
duties, since that action hns resulted in
the importation of immense quantities of
very cheap, inferior tea â "'the sweepings
of the tea-nouses of China, Japan and
India."
Although the consumers pay an aver
age of 50 cents per pound for their tea it
can be laid down in New York, according
to Robert T. Porter, for 10 cents a pound,
and the average ol all grades is only 13.5
cents a pound. This shows that the bene
fits of free imports do not go into the
pockets of trie consumer. It is stated as a
well-known fact that in countries where
tea Is dutiahle the average quality of the
leaf imported is always much superior to
that brought to this country.
It is to be noted in this connection that
the commis-ioners appointed under the
act of Congress last March to consider the
importation of impure and miwholesome
tea has finished its labors. Sixteen stan
dards of tea have Deen established, and all
along the line of the various qualities, two
grades above what has formerly been ad
mitted, will now be required. In the case
of green teas, \rhich, to a far greater ex
tent than black teas, have been imported
in adulterated and spurious qualities, the
new law, it enforced, will be, it is said, a
practical exclusion to all but a few grades.
There will be much protection in this
law from unwholesome teas if the exam
iners in the ports of New York, San Fran
cisco and Chicago attend to their business
properly. The proposed tax will aid in
excluding trashy teas by making it un
profitable to import them. Tho tea-deal
ers are reported to be in iavor of the duty,
and it is not likely that consumers will
feel it. It mart be borne in mind, more
over, that the duty is levied purely as an
emergency tax to meet the deficit caused
by the Democratic tariff.
DOGS IN COUKT.
The fine canines who are to meet in the
Mechanics' Pavilion on Wednesday would
doubtless bo rouen insulted if they could
Know that the United States Supreme
Court l:as recently decided that dogs are
not property, because they partake rather
of the nature of "ferre natune" than of use
ful,civiiized animals. Ills well for theirfeel
ings that they cannot read the papers and
see that the supreme wisdom of the land
has classed them among wild beasts or
they might raise a great howl of indigna
tion about it.
The case i aÂ«sed on by th 6 court was the
suit of a Louisiana man against a railway
company for $200 for killing his dog. In
the decision the court said: "The very
fact that they are without the protection
of the criminal laws shows tnat property
in dogs is of an imperfect or qualified
nature, and that they stand aa it were
between animals, 'ferre naturae,' in which
until subdued there is no property, and
domesticated animals in which the right
of property is complete. They are not
considered as being upon the same plane
as horses, cattle, sheep and other domes
tic animals, but rather in the category of
cats, monkeys, parrots, singing birds and
similar animals kept for pleasure, curiosity
or caprice. Unlike other domestic ani
mals, they are useful neither as beasts of
burden, for draught, nor for food."
Many an owner of a valuable doe will be
inclined to question the wisdom of this de
cision. To think that a railway company
or any one else ran destroy the lives of
their rets and not be liao'e for damages is
exasperating. Perhaps some of those who
sei most store upou their pets can console
TIIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 17, 1897.
themselves with considering that some
dogs are not less but more than property.
There seems much justice in the Louisiana
law that does to be recognized as property
must be placed upon the assessment rolls,
otherwise many a worthless cur would
suddenly become of great value as soon as
he was killed.
The summing up of the dog's condem
nation, "they are useful neither as beasts
of burden, for draught, nor lor food," has
an odd sound, for surely there is a long
list of usefulnesses lesides these. What
an expression of lofty disdain and disgust
would overcome the countenance of some
magnificent St. Bernard if l.c could be
told that the Supreme Court had placed
him "in the category of cats, monkeys
and parrots."
STILL IMPBOVIN'
As far as statistics go trade is on a satis*
factory footing. The bank clearances show
an increase over last year, money is in
good supply and readily accessible to bor
rowers/with desirable security, failures are
not above the average and collections are
fair. The importations of foreign goods
into the United States during the month
of March were valued at $76,355,000,
against $66,455,000 during the same month
in 1896, and it is expected that the April
exhibit will run over $80,000,000 in value.
While heavy imports do not necessarily
Imply good times, they show an improved
purchasing power, which is csrtainly not
an indication of dull times, hence the
abovj exhibit is in this sense satisfactory.
It must not be forgotten, however, that
imports have been heavy for some
months, as importers have loaded up with
as many goods as they couW conveniently
carry in anticipation of the promised tariff
bill, which a patient and lone-suffering
community hopes will be passed as soon
as possible.
As far as the port of San Francisco is
concerned the balance of business is with
us. This is shown by increased exports uf
tho great cereal staple*, oy larger bank
clearings and by a marked increase in
custom-house and internal revenue col
lections. It is also shown by the steady
rise in wheat, and by an improved de
mand for what little dried fruit is left on
nand. Tne only drawback of late has
been the absence of the usual spring
rains, which have been replaced by dam
aging hot north winds. Still, in spite of
these drawbacks, the State will have a
profitable surplus of everything. Califor
nia enjoys this advantage over its sister
States, that owing to its diversified
climate the conditions that damage one
section benefit another; so that the most
unfavorable weather never cauÂ»es general
harm. This is one of the chief reasons
why prosperity, even in a modified form,
always attends California in the face of
conditions which would prostrate almost
any other State.
As the summer approaches the pros
pects for the farmer steadily improve. He
is going to receive better pricet for his
wheat this year. lie is going to take in
more money for his fruit, hay, wool, hops,
beef and mutton. This means that he is
eoine to be a more liberal purchaser in
the c ty. This commercial logic is famil
iar to business men, who see in it good
times ahead. Hence there is more dispo
sition to loosen purse-strings and extend
financial acomnioJat on.
Another good sign is the increase in
money circulation throughout the United
States during the present year. The cir
culation per capita on May L 1897, was
$22 93 against $21 05 a year ago, a gain of
$1 28 per capita. In round numbers there
has been an increase in circulation of
$63,000,000 in gold coin, $2-3,000,000 in silver
certificates, $10,000,000 in greenbacks. $27,-
OOO.OCQ in currency certificates and $8,000,
--030 la sank notes. This showing ought to
satisfy the most chronic pessimist, for an
increase in money circulation is never
seen when times are hard.
But a good many people are hard to
suit. They are not content with a slow
and steady, and therefore permanent, im
provement in business. They want a
boom. They want to get rich in a year.
They want to double their business on the
spot. If they cannot enjoy these rare and
extreme conditions they draw long face!)
and cry hard limes. These are ths per
sons who now lament the dullness of
trade. If such grumblers will heed the
lessons contained in the above exhibits
they may be led to taee the more cheerful
ana sensible view of the situation and ad
mit that it is improving day after day.
Of course, the improvement is slow, for
permanent changes are always gradual,
and the fact that the present improvement
is of slow growth is the best guaranty of
its permanence.
COASI EXCHANGES.
Redding is about to expand industrially un
der the acquisition of a steam laundry of the
most approved pattern, according to the Free
Press.
The Fresno Expositor has proposed that rice
planting be tried in that fertile section, aud
thinks the result will prove successful, in
which conviction it is fortified by a number
of concurring correspondents.
The Santa Rosa Evening Press has come out
as a six-page daily. The increase in sizo be
came necessary on account of increase in
subscribers and advertising. This is a sign
that one section of the country, at least, is re
covering from the effects of four years of
Clevelandism. Other sections are following
suit.
According to the Newman Tribune, another
big section of farming land will soon be un
derwater. The paper states that a new canal
which parallels the present canal, but Is
nearer the hills, will t>e carried to Tracy at an
early date. This will brine much of the land
between Newman and the Coast Range under
water. A canal following tne base of the hills
has lone bsen desired, and would greatly
augment the value of toe land under it. The
uew canal will be completed to Los Banos
Creek within a mouth, when work will be
suspended until fall.
The Redding Free Press says that the mining
outioolc ia increasing in interest every day;
new finds are of daily occurrence and new
men with capital are pouring in from every
quarter. Scarcely a day passes mat we do not
hear of some mining sale or of negotiations
looking toward a transfer of mining property.
Shasta County has become an attraction that
her enormous mineral wealth amply merits,
and is rapidly taking front rank with the best
mining localities on the coast. All of the old

Tne growing o f tobacco in California has
really become an established industry instead
of the experiment it wa* a few years ago. Ac
cording to the Champion of Downey, that sec
tion is deep into toe business. The big to
bacco company at that place has enough
plant* to set out 100 aces. They are receiv
ing orders for plauta from Riverside, Or^nce
and Ban Diego counties, at 15 cents per 100.
The p. ants will be ready to set out In ten or
fifteen days and are the earliest plants now
growing in California. Sumatra tobacco,
which grows well here, will be worth $3 50
uer pound, and the farmer who fails to put
one to five acres in tobacco will regret it this
(all when he sees tne profits to be made in
raising it.
Here is an altruistic dream indulged In by
the night editor of the Santa Rosa L'rpub'ican,
albeit we sincerely trust it may "come true":

'east 1000 people. KegoUttioai axe pending

Walker tract on the laguna between Santa
Rosa and Sebastopol to tbe Salvation Army
for colonization purposes. The army wiil sub
divide the tract into five-acre ranches. A
small house and stable, together with poultry
buildings, will be erected on each. Deserving
people desirous of owning homes will be
invited to come and settle. The army will
supply all the necessities of life until the pro
ceeds of the place are sufficient to support the
family thereon. After that ;he settlers will
repay the army in small installments extend

A substance, which tor want of a better
name has been called "mineral soap," has just
been discovered near Randsburg, says the
Miner of that lively camp. E. Bazore and J.
Bump were the men who found the strange
stuff and their claim is located in the Summit
District. In weight and hardness the sub
stance has the consistency of soapstone, and
varies in color from almost white to yellowish
brown. It has a salty and a slight soapy taste,
and when placed in water and nibbed pro
duces a lather similar to that of soap. The
ledge where the mineral soap was found
is about fifty feet wide and can be traced for a
long distance. No analysis has yet been made,
but as soon as this is done, provided the new
substance proves to have any commercial value
the work of developing the ledge will be
pushed as rapidly as possible. There is a
chance that the stuff may be a natural com
bination of petroleum and borax, in which
case it will be very valuable.
NEWS OF FURE.GN NAVIES.
The Chinese Government has ordered eleven
protected cruisers and torpedo-boat destroyers
from German shipyards.
The battle-ship Canopus, building at Ports
mouth dockyard, still keeps the lead iv
rapidity of construction over the other yards.
Since January 4, when the first keel plate was
laid, 1975 ions nad been worked into the hull
up to April 25. This constitutes about one
third of the weight of the hull, and at this rate
her launch may be looked for within the
present year by a good margin.
It takes years to build a vessol in France of
even moderate dimensions. The d'Eitrees, a
third-class cruiser, sheathed, is building at
Rochefort, the order for her construction being
given July 29, 1896, and the year 1900 being
fixed for completion. The d'Estrees is only
2413 tons displacement, with engines of 8500
horsepower, calculated to give a speed of 20.5
knots. The estimated cost is $910,711.
Two torpedo-boat destroyers, the first of that
typj in the French navy, arc being built at the
Normand yard. They are of 300 tons displace
ment, 180 feet in length and 19 feet 6 inches
beam, with 10 feet 6 inches draught aft. Only
20 kno.s are expected on 4800 horsepower.
Their armament will consist of one nine
pounder, six six-pounders and two torpedo
tubes, and the cost of each boat is $325,397.
The estimnted cost, exclusive of runs, of the
four first-class cruisers of 11,000 tons and
16,000 horsepower, taken from the British
naval estimates, is tor tho Andromeda,
$2,738,610, Diadem !?2.tf74,450, Niobe, $2,
--879.180, Europa $2,834,950. The Andromeda j
is being built at Pembroke dockyard, the |
others by contract, and it wiil be noteJ that j
the estimates for the dockyard-built ship are
the lowest of auy.
The cost of the nine battle-ships of 14,900
tons and 12,000 horsepower, building for the
British navy, aggregates $39,985,915. Seven
of them are building in the dockyards and
two by contract. The hisrhest estimate is
$4,566,810, for the Majestic at Portsmouth ; i
$4,347,305 is the lowest, for the Illustrious at |
Chatham, while the Jupiter and Mars, built
by contract, are estimated to cost $4,3u9,915
and $4,401,295 each.
The Isis, Becond-class cruiser of 5600 tons,
had a narrow escape last month from destruc
tion by fire at Chatham dockyard, where she
is fitting for her completion. Spontaneous
combustion fired a lot of oily waste left on the I
upper deck, and considerable damage was |
done before the fire was extinguished. Three j
serious collisions of ships on the home I
stations and fire on board of a ship is tne j
record o' one month's accidents in the British
navy.
Electricity on shipboard was only intro
duced about nine years ago, chiefly for light
ing purposes, but up to the present time It
has grown in utility, largely taking the place
of the ordinary steam engine and of hand
labor. In the French navy electricity is more
extensively used than in any other, while
Great Britain prefers to await practical re
sults and does not care to take the chances of !
delicate macnines and other contrivances
breaking down or failing at a critical moment, i
Some idea of the extensive use of electricity
on ships-of-war can bo formed from the outfit
of the ermored cruiser Jose Garibaldi of the
Argentine navy. There are 450 electric lam pi
in the citadel and below ihs protective dect;
230 lamps used for general lighting outside
of the protected psruof the ship, six venti
lators, one laruo searchlight, three ammuni
tion hoists, two motors for each turret and
seven other motors comprise the varied uses
of electricity on this latest modern ship-of-war.

AROUND THE CORRUORS
Players ere affected almost as deeply by hap
penings In the audience as is the audience by
happenings on the stage. Sometimes they are
moved to wrath, but more frequently to
laughter. Occasionally they are frightened
out of their lines and wits.
A man sat in an aisle seat, three rows from
the front, at a performance of "El Capitan" at
Baldwin Theater Saturday night. He was a fat
man, and he gave a sneeze suddenly, a terific
sneeze. It was followed by another that shook
the plumes on ttie big bats of the women
around and made the lights flicker. The audi
ence suspended attention and looked at
the sneezer, and the playeis paused just as he
snorted out a third sneeze that ended in a high
note such as seldom had been heard in those
parts. Hopper stretched out his long arms to
ward the man, rolled bis eyes heavenward,
and said in a sepulchral voice:
"Heaven bless you, sir."
This brought jhe audience back to the stage
with a roar, and in a second the performance
was running on at high pressure, while the
fat man chuckled over the fact that for a brief
space he had teen the star of the evening. A
few minutes later a Cau, man asked Mr. Hop
per how he was affected by the funny things
thathapDenin the audiences. After getting
a grip on El Capitan's nose and throwing down
a cup oi hot coffee, as he does between acts, he
answered:
"American audiences are not demonstra
tive, and, as a rule, things don't happen in
front. Of course, tue man who sneezed to
night couldn't help ir, but he made such a
blasting success of it that it affected the whole
house, and, therefore, the player*. If an actor
is playing a part where he can say something
it is the best thing to do so, for it makes them
all laugh and keeps them from noticing a
pause. I remember one night when I was
playing at Palmer's Theater in New York,
when we lighted something suspended from
the scenery by a string the flames ran up the
| string, and in a minute the audience was all
| excitement. We had to ring the curtain down,
I and as they couldn't see, the people were more
j frightened than ever. Everybody saw that
I tbere would ba a panic if something wasn't
| dove, and the paople behind the scenes began
to say: 'Hopper, for God's sake say something.
You can think of something to say which will
quiet them. Get at 'em quick.' I ran out in
front and shouted:
'"There is absolutely no danger. I assure
you. You know lam the greatest coward on
esrth, and if there was any danger of my get
ting singed you can well imagine that I would
not be cooling my heels here right now. 1
"So the audience remained periectly quiet
"There was a man iv New York who cer
tainly affected me and got to be unpleasant,
to say the least of it. He was a fat fellow and
always wore a boy's hat. He kept a hotel in
the Catskills. As soon as my company would
open he'd come down for the season and come
every night. He never bought a seat, but paid
for an admission, put bis sassy little hat upon
the rail and took his stand back of it. He'd
begin to chuckle and then to laugh. There
was something about his laughter that struck
the people, and soon they would all begiu to
look at him, and next they'd start in to laugh
ing at him. Laughter is often as contagious
j as tears, and his was certainly tbe most con
| tagious laugh I ever heard. He came to be
j known as the laughing man. That was iunny
for a while, but he came to be a nuisance, for
he anticipated every joke and would laugti so
loudiy that tne audience nine times out of ten
lost the point. One night Andrew A. McCor
mick, manager of the Broadway Theater,
found a man in the foyer doubled up over ihe
programme table. He had every appearance
of having eaten a peck of green apples, with
j the natural result; but when Mr. McCormick
! asiced if he was ill, he said:
" 'Oh, no; I'm just dead with laughing at
that laughing man. My sides ached so I
couldn't stand it another minute. I had to
get out.'
"After that we got rid of the hotal-keeper,
for we didn't like to run the risk of his mak
ing people sick.
"Then there is the chap who starts the ap-
I plause too early. Of course applause is stimu
! laiing when it comes at tho right time, and if
I an actor's efforts are received warmly and cor
>' dially he naturally gives a belter performance.
In short, the andience unconsciously does Its
share in making the pertormance enjoyable,
but the man who anticipates is an uncontrol
lable nuisance.
"One of the funniest things that ever hap
pened iv an audience when I was playing
took place at tbe Columbia Theater in Chi
cago. All tbe persons in the gallery, men and
women, began to shout at the women in the
orchestra to take off their hats. It was amus
ing, because if every woman in the orchestra
I nad worn a hat 40 feet high the gallery gods
| wouid still have a perfect view of the stage.
! But they cowled and hissed and hooted and
j harangued until only three women in the
| orchestra kept their hats on. That didn't sat
isiy the gallery gods, and they kept at it until
I an audience with uncovered heads faced me.
It is unnecessary to state that the performance
stopped while the row was going on. How
did It affect me? I longed for the seclusion of
the Lambs' Club, where I can bleat as loudly
and as long ai I please, but I had to stand
there and look distressed. Lots of funny
things happen in front, but actors, like
schoolteachers, must learn to see aud yet be
b.ind."

THE ARTILLERY WOULD LIKE THE
STAR.
iew York Sun.
The retirement of General Wheaton forage
last Saturday will cause the promotion of a
brigadier to be major-generaL and then of
some colonel of the line to nil t;.e vacancy
among the brigadiers.
Who will the fortunate colonel be? JSome ar
tillery officers have urged the senior in their
arm, Colonel W. M. Graham, commanding the
Fifth Artillery, and there are interesting par
ticulars in the record they have made up.
Colonel Graham stands only eleventh on the
relative lisr of line colonels, but, as is well
known, selection and not seniority governs
the choice whenever a star is awarded.
He will be retired for age Â».ooner than any of
the ten co ouels above nim, namely, in thir
teen months irom this time. Hence the rea
son potent in the case of General Wheaton,
passing aim over the head of General Brooke,
would apply to Colonel Graham. That is, the
appointment of any one else w uUI be fatal to
nis cham.es, whereas his appointment would
leave any one of his ten seniors still eligible
for the star after he retires next year.
Again, the artillery has not furnished a
brigadier-general from among its colonels
since the end of the Civil War. Promotion is
so slow in the artillery that again and again
a senior colonel in that arm has found in
fantry and cavalry colonels ahead of him in
relative rank, promotion having given them
the grade earlier. The result has been in
variably thus far that they have been taken
for the scar and the artiiU-ry colonel has been
left.
Nevertheless it has sometimes happened
that an artillery colonel has been longei in the
service tnau other regimental commanders,
who have riseu to be his seniors in relative
rank. And the friends of Colonel Graham
point out that he is to-day the ranking co:cnel
in length of service under line commissions.
He has a fine war record, with four brevets, in-
CliKling that of brUadier-general.
The artillery have another candidate, also
a very ab.e one and fUbiu-d strongly, in Coio
nel R. T. Frank. First Artillery. But thus far
there is no Indication as to whether they will
be successful.
JERRY SIMPSON'S NE vV CHUM-
Washington Post.
Jerry Simpson and Colonel James Hamilton
Lewis of Washington State have evidently en
tered into an alliance. Champ Clark say* be
overheard the Kansas leader importuning the
Washington man to stand with him, saying:
"If you will only get up when the Republi
cans are .shouting for the regular order those
clothes of yours will attract bo much attention
that the Democrats will all vote with us
against adjournment." Lewis looked puzzled,
but not cffended. He shook hands with S.mp
son on the compact. 'When the time came he
carried out his part of it, but they didn't get
votes enough to prevent an adjournment, al
though there were more Democrats voted
against it than usual.
A:ier adjournment Richardson and some
others werÂ« talking together and ca led Simp
son over where they were, wheu iJell o( Colo
rado asked him:
"How is it that you and Lewis of Washing
ton are always together now? If there's a
man in the House who doesn't look like one
of your crowd i. is Lewis.' 1
"That does seem so, Bell." replied Simpson
gravely. "That iellow Lewis is the strangest
combination I ever saw. He has been a mys
tery to me until I went to cultivating him and
got close to him. He dresses like a gemibug
Republican, talks like a Bryan Democrat, but
votes like a middle-of-the-road Populist. You
bet I'm tied to him."

that the pie which the President had to dis
tribute won't go around by a long cads. It

"Ana leg will do me." she answered. As

Pat blandly inquired of his nighbor.
"I balave Oi will take a leg, too," said Moike,

paired, and the lower cabin enlarged for
sixty more passengers. She can now ac
commoaate2oo ua?sengers.

been chartered by the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company to transport a cartio of gen
eral merchandise to t-an Jose cie Guate- j
mala. Tins is the steamer that so re- |
cently created havoc by running into her j
wharf. On her, alsu, the mate was killed
by the engineer in a duel at Acapulco, ow
ing to trouble arising oat of an explosion
of her boilers, by whicli nve men were

lik iihood have to ship a "scab" crew.
On her last atiempt to go to sea, about
three weeks ago, the Monitor shipped
ti:ree Jeet of water and was brought back
to Oakland Creek for repair?. Since that
time practical jokers have instigated small
boys to approach the captain in procession
and ask if he were not going to take a
larger stock of life-preservers than usual
alone on the next trip. Xne result is
always a verbal expioÃion.

REGULAR ARMY CHANGES
An Efficient O.ficer Retires
From Department Head
quarters.
A Sham Battle to fie Fought at the
Presidio This Morning-The Field
Day on Wednesday N^xt.
The recent changes that have been made
in the army consequent upon many pro
| motions have resulted in a number of
changes in the army headquarters in the
Pbeian building and at the Presidio post.
Brigadier-General Forsyth. who would
not have been retire! on account of age
until August 26, 1898, immediately upon
being promoted to the position of major
general appointed First Lieutenant J. F.
Reynolds Landis his aid-de-camp and on
the following day asked to be placed on
the retired list. His request was at once
compiled with. Thereupon, pursuant to
the direction of telegraphic orders from
President McKinley, William K. Shatter,
brigadier-General, who was on wailing
orders, assumed command of the department
of California on lsst Friday. The new com
mander has appointed as his alda-de-camp
First Lieutenant Robert B. Noble of the First
Infantry and First Lieutenaut John I>. Miiey
of the Fifth Artillery, who succeed First Lieu
tenant J. Franklin Isell. Seventh Cavalry, and
First Lieutenant Landis, First Cavalry, who
filled these positions under Brigadier-General
Forsyth.
Lieutenant Bell, who had been absent for
gome time in Washington, was on his own ap
plication relieved from duty as aid, and he
has been directed to proceed to Fort Apache,
Arizona. Lieutenant Landis will probably be
ordered to join his regiment at Fort Kiley.
During the time that Lieutenant Landis has
occupied the position he has just vacated he
by his affable manner and courteous treat
ment of those who called upon him made a
host of friends, who will regret that military
necessity will take him away from the post he
heid for a long time and filled so well.
Tne non-commissioned officers and men at
the Presidio, while pleased that the post's
former commander Is now brigadier-general
and in charge of the Department of Califor
nia, regret his departure as commander
of the post, and say "we only hope the next
commander will be as well liked and as much
thought of as was Colonel Shatter while he
was in command here. He was an ideal com
mander."
The heavy fogs during the past week pre
vented the practice with tbe large rifled guns
at the Fort Point fortifications, and as accu
racy of aim Is ibe object to be attained in this
practice guns will not be fired unless the day
Is clear. On Friday three shots were fired
with mortars, but the result has uol yet been
announced.
On Friday large signs announcing that
civilians will not be permitted to approach
within one mile of the batteries were placed in
position on the roads leuding from the I're
sidio proper to the fortifications.
This morning there will be another sham
battle on Oo'tt Hill at tne Presidio, it will
take place between hid:' past 9 and 11 o'clock.
All branches of the service will take part in
the battle and the line of action will be a de
fense of the fortifications at Fort Point against
tiie advance of an imaglnarv enemy approach
ing from tbo gate at Central avenut*.
First Lieutenant R. C. Croxton, Company A,
First Infantry, has been appointed acting
adjutant of the Presidio post, vice Lieutenant
Noble, appointed atn-<ie-camp, and First
Lieutenant Benjamin H. Randolph, Battery G,
Third Artillery, has Deen appointed ordnance
and engineer officer and placed in charge of
the gardens Â«t the Presidio post, vice Lieuten
ant Miiey, appointed aid-de-camp.
First Lieutenant John A. Lock wood of the
Fourth Cavalry, attached to Troop C, has been
detailed as recruHing-oflieer.
Next Wednesday there will be held on the
parade ground the monthly field events, and
irom the programme that has been prepared
it Ik likely that there will be considerable com
petition for honors and prizes.

CRITICIZE THE
CHRISTIAN HELL
Mrs. Annie Besant Talks
of Existence After
Death.
Future Suffering Is but Tempo
rary and a Stage of Up
ward Development.
'â â .'â â â  â  â¢ '
There Are Many Persons Who Can
Pass in Spirit to Astral World
and Bring Back Reports.
Mrs. Annie Besant lectured last night!
at Metropolitan Hall on the subject of
"Life and Death," to a house that was
very full, considering the disagreeable
weather. She dwelt mainly on the tbeo
sophic conception of what will be the
spirit's condition after this physical body
is left in the grave.
In describing the various stages through,
which the soul must pass in the upward
evolution the speaker made some critical
comparisons of orthodox ideas of the
hereafter with those taught by theosophy.
She says that while the Christian belief in
a future life is firm, it is very vague. This
vagueness is displayed by asking such
questions as, "Will we recognize our
friends in the hereafter?" Theosophy has
no vagueness on this point, but answers
positively that wa will know them, and
that no soul can lose a friend or a loved
one except by an act of its own will. , 'â¢,.â ;
Another criticism was in regard to the
doctrine of an eternal heli taught In many'
of our churches. This is abhorrent to
advanced thought. The hell explained by
theosophy is a terrible one, but it is only a
temporary one â just one stage in a long
process of development. This lowest
stage of disembodied life is only for those
few who have while in life surrendered
themselves to the sway of the most brutal
passions. Its torture is caused by their
own wicked minds. Even for them this
I hell: was but a purification and a prepara
tion for an advanced condition of being.
Yet another criticism of the orthodox
faith was of the gloom, the black draping,
| and irrational grief of the funerals. Death
I should rather be rejoiced at as a birth into
a higher life. The birthday of the soul
should not be a day of lamentations. :
Information about the hereafter should:
not be sought from mediums by calling
back the spirits of the dead, because this
is apt to be very inaccurate and it is in
juriously retarding to the disembodied
soul to call its attention back to earthly
affairs. The true way Jo seek for this
knowledge is to question those in this
present life who have the power to throw
oft. physical impediments aud pass in
spirit through the astral worlds and stages
more advanced. There are many people,'
and their number is rapidly increasing,
who can bring back information from the
world beyond death just as certainly as a
traveler to some foreign country can re
turn to their friends with an account of
what they saw and heard.
She cosed in ardent eloquence with an
explanation of how the soul, by noble
aspirations and right living, can bind itself
forever to its loved ones.
Mrs. Besant will deliver her last lecture
to-night at Metropolitan Hall. The sub
ject will be "Theosoptiy and Christianity."
rihe will leave this City to-morrow
to San Jose, Santa Cruz and various cities
in Southern California. Then she will go
to Portland, Or., through Washington
State, into Canada. On the 27ih of June
she wili be in Chicago to attend the Theo
sophical convention. In the fall she will
be in New England, and thence will return
to England, where she will remain until
spring. > . -.:,.,â ...'

SWOONS IN THE WATER.
The Australian, Cavill, Collapses
While Racing With Dana
Thompson.
The Foundation for the New Picture
Gallery of the Park Museum Will
Be Laid This Week
What promised to be a very pretty raoe
at the Chutes yesterday afternoon was
spoiled by tho collapse of the Australian
champion swimmer, Charies Cavill, who
swooned, sank and was dragged out of the
water as limp as a rag and unable to
speak. He was swimming a quarter mile
race against Dana Thompson for $250 a
side and the gate money. His opponent
swam out the remaining lans, making the
quarter mile in 5 mm. 56}4 sec, which
time, if it had been an official race, would
have broken the record by nearly half a
minute.
Cavill was pulled out of the water by
Fred Green. It was about a quarter of an
Â«BW to-day:

hour before he could speak. In the mean
time there were many theories advanced
to account lor his sudden breakdown.
Some of his friends thought he was over
trained, and others said cigarettes did the
damage. After being dosed with brandy
and vigorously rubbed for & long time the
Australian got his voice, and accounted
for the accident by the supposition that
he had swallowed some water and the
violent effort to cough it out had caused
"something to go wrong" in his chest.
The betting had been 5 to 3 against
Thompson. The Australian had pre
viously made the quarter in 6:13, and
Thompson had made the distance two
years ago in 6:oÃJ*>.
There were fairly good crowds at the
park and the ocean beach in spite of the
threatening clouds. The foundations of
the new picture gallery of tne Park Mu
seum will be laid this week. Lajt week
the Commissioners decided that by the
next cold weather the museum would be
hented throughout with steam pipes.

DRIVEN INSANE
THROUGH WANT
Sad Condition of Yvonne
Carlton, a Stranded
Actress.
She Failed to Get a Situation
and Had Not Eaten Any
thing for Days.
The Actors' and Actresses' Relief
Fand Society Will Giva Her
Proper Care.
Yvonne Carlton, a stranded actress, is
in a padded cell in the Receiving Hospi
tal, i:er unfortunate condition being pri
marily due to nervous prostration caused
by worry and want.
About 1 o'clock yesterday mornins Dr.
Bunneli was summoned from his office to
go to the Florence House, on Ellis and
Powell streets, as a lady was suffering
lrom hysteria. The lady was Mr*. Carl
ton. He found her in a violently hysteri
cal condition, shrieking for her baby that
ehe declared had been burned to death.
She had arrived at the Florence House
only a lew hours before and had gone to
the room assigned her, telling the clerk
she wouid register later. By some means,
while undressing, her long golden hair
had caught tire irom an open gasjet in
ncr room and she rushed out shrieking
lor help.
As she apparently had neither friends
nor money Dr. Bnnnell summoned the
ambulance and hau her taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital. During the night she
became so violent that she had to be put
in a padded cell.
Very liltle was known about her until
yesterday when Louis lmhau*, stago
manager at the Grand Opera-house and
president of the Actois' and Actresses' Re
lief Fund Society, who had learned of her
condition, called at the hospital to see her.
He arranged to have hÂ«rÂ»ent to the German
Hospital to-day, where it is expected that
she will, with proper attention, be all
r.Â£ it again mentally in a few days.
Mrs. Carlton was a member of the Im
perial Operatic Comedy Company, of
which Linere and Stringer were managers.
They played in British Columbia and the
Puget Sound country and got stranded in
Sacramento.
Mrs. Carlton had a child 3 years of age
that traveled with her, but during a fire in
Seattle the child was burned to death.
Af:er arriving her from Sacramento Bhe
endeavored to get an engagement in one
of the Jocal theaters, but failed.
Then she tried to get employment in
some of the stores, but again failed, and
as a last resource she endeavored to ob
tain employment in some private famiiy,
but failure acain met her.
She had been stopping at a hotel on
Kearny street, and Saturday night when
her b 11 was presented for payment she
whs unable to meet it, being penniless.
She I ad to leave the hotel and went to the
Florence House.
She had not eaten anything for three days
and In her weakened" condition menially
and physica ly, when her hair caught fire
she i nought oi the death of her baby and
she became mentally unbalanced.
She was aDie to talk intelligently yester
day afternoon and gave a brief sketch of
her life. She said she was adopted by a
wealthy couple in the East, who gave her
a splendid education. Shortly after grad
uating irom college she married, but after
a brief experience of married life she and
her husband separated tnroogh the inter
ference of her mother-in-law, ana she
came west with her baby, securing an en
e.-cmeni with a theatrical company.
When her adopted parents learned that
she had chosen the stage they disowned
her, and she was left to fi^bt the batila of
hie her.-elf. Yvonne Carlton is her stage
name and she jealously guards the secret
of her true name.
BAY CITY'S PICNIC RUN.
Large Gathering of Wheelmen
at Blithedale Yester
day.
The B-st Attended and Most Erjoy
ab e Outing the Cyclists
Have Ever Held.
The largest club run the Bay City
Wheelmen have ever held was that led
by Captain Henry L. Day to Blithedale,
in Marin County, yesterday. Ninety men
were in line, and riding two abreast they
strung out over considerable ground.
This is also said to be the largest run of
a single club ever taken out of San Fran
cisco.
The Bay Citys have a run to Blithedale
annually, and this one yesterday was the
fourth.
The members took the 10 o'clock boat to
Sausalito and rode from there to their
destination, about six miles.
Numerous out-door games were indulged
in before lunch, baseball pleasing the
fancy of many. Two "nines" were ar
ranged with about twenty men on each
side, so as to have plenty of fielders or
"scouts."
Lunch was served in the large dining
room of the hotel at noon, and the tired
athletes did justice to a splendid repast.
After this they repaired to the field again,
played more baseoall and other games'
and were photographed.
The start for home was made late in the
afternoon, and all reached the boat just
before it commenced to rain. When they
reached this Bide they had to walk home
in the rain, as the cable-slots were wet
and, therefore, unridable. Some availed
themselves of the Hayes, Sacramento and
California street car lines, which carry
bicycles. Those who attended the run
were:
H. L. Day, captain; A. E. Kellom, first lieu
tenant; J. M. Pike, second lieutenant; H. W.

attended. The Olympic Wheelmen went

ARE THE MASTERS HERE?
A The sophist Who Says This
Is the Period for Elder
Brothers' Aid.
At thÂ» Last Quarter of Every Century
There Is an Effort to Promote
Things Spiritual.
Of unusual interest in this revival of
iheosophical thought was the lecture oi
Miss Anne Bryce on "The Masters of
Wisdom," given before the San Francisco
Theosophical Society last night at the
Academy of Sciences hall. Specially note
worthy to the lay mind was the sugges
tion that this period in tbe course of the
centuries is peculiarly ripe for special aid
from the mysterious "elder brothers" of
mankind. In this connection Miss Bryce
said:
Like all else in nature it is easier for the
masters to help mankind at certain periods
taan at others. We are told that the lodge
always takes advantage of the last quarter of
every century to brlug about the realization
ol things sDiritual in place of the dense mate
rial. A* we know that seeds planted at certain
seasons oi the year yield a far richer harvest
than at other timei, so the thought waves
sent out by the masters at the end of the cen
tury bring about greater results and lift up
many souis to the point where they cai as
sist in carrying the spiritual truths 'through
the mnterial age of tne next century.
Not only have we been helped during these
lnst twenty years on account of it being the
end of the 100-year cycle, but It 1Â« also the end
of a 5000-year cycieâ the first 5000 years of
the Kali Yuga, the black or iron age. The
cycles closing together has been a wo.iderful
opportunity for the world to take a step for
ward into the knowledge of the real or inner
man. Many have taken and are taking this
steu. The world is looking for more light
They are restlessâ not content with what they
were taught in childhood's days.
We believe that many of the masters have
reached the point where they are no longer
obliged to incarnate, but who voluntarily
mke a physica, b dy (with all its linvtaiions")
for the sole purpose oi helping us. What an
example for us to follow! What a privilege
to work for and with those unselfish souls!
And we firmly believe that all men who nre
striving to lead a pure and unselfish life a-id
assist in forming tne nucleus of the universal
brotherhood of humanity for which the Theo
sophical Society was lounded are surely work
ing for and assisted by these our elder
brothers â our brothers still, though lar in ad
vance of us, and they ouly represent that
which is possible for you and me to become if
we but work unselfishly for ourselves. Then
we, too, will have become a perfected man, a
wise one, a master. Let us strive and ever
keep striving.

most gratifying to the promoters of the
movement to erect a monument to Abra

A great deal of credit for the work
being accomplished rests with the finer
element of the community. With the
keen perception and liner comprehension
peculiar to their sex, the mothers and
daughters stand in lull realization of the
great underlying lesson in patriotism and
pride of country inspiring the undertak
ing, and it is to them in instilling .the
minds of the little ones with lessons of
the greatness and self-denial of the great
Emancipator that the credit of the
aroused enthusiasm among the school
children is to be given.
It may prove interesting to add that
Mrs. J. Murray Bailey, the first lady mem
ber of the league, has been appointed a
member of tae literary committee, the
tirbt appointment of a lady on any com*

THE GOSPEL OF PEACE.
Rev. H. T. Shepard Preaches
Upon the National Need
of Arbitration.
Says That Final Solution of Problems
Mast Come Through the Educa
tion of the M .Sses.
ReT. H. T. Sbepard of the Olivet Con
gregational Church preached last night on
the subject of "Peace." He said in part:
"The Nation has learned the meaning of
war in its revolutionary struggle for re
ligious ami political freedom and in costly
civil strife. We are ready for permanent
domestic and foreign peace ii ways can be
found to achieve that end, which is most
devoutly to be wished.
"The treaty of arbitration has been de
feated in the Senate, wnich has thus de
clined to obey a very strong and wide
spread wish of our Nation. Leading edu
cators and publicists and large masses of
our people favor the treaty. We believe
its defeat is only temporary. No friend
of peace should rest till popular seriti
ment and law are lor peaceful settlement
of all quarrels at home and abroad.
'â¢Final solution of problems which con
cern the peace of our ftation must corue
through education of the masses.
"No question is ever settled till it is
settled right, and highest ideals of right
include domestic and foreign peace."
Life and Mission
of Swedenborg.
Rev. J. S. David of the Swedonborg Mis
sion Society said in his lecture at Wash
ington Hall last night: Great men are
not usually appreciated in their own day.
Emerson considered Swedenborg so im
mense that it required "a long focal
distance to see him." In his own day
Swedenborg was known chiefly as a
mathematician, a scientist, an inventor
and a statesman. He was known as a
great scholar and a man of exemplary
life; but when he left the world, and for
years afterward, scarcely any one sus
pected the existence of the vast spiritual
philosophy that he left to the world. His
principal mission was to reveal the inter
nal sense of the holy word, the nature of
the divine humanity and of man, the laws
of regeneration, the science of correspond
ences am! discrete degrees, the true life of
brotherly love, the divine law of use, the
state of man after death and many other
things of vital interest which could not
have been received in a former age. ThÂ«
light and montal expansion of the nine
teenth century is bringing this philosophy
to the front. Swedenborg was not a
medium; he never spoke or wrote under
control; he never held a seance; never
took money for any spiritual work. He
was the reverse to a fanatic; never sought
to proielyte; avoided sensations; pre
dicted that his work would Rrow slowly,
and slowly it did grow; but the growth is
sure, and to-day It is permeating all
churches and modifying all religious and
scientific thought

Three hundred or more railroad con
ductors arrived in the City last evening,
and fully 200 of the number sought shelter
at the Russ House. Rain was falling at
Los Angeles when the conductors left the
land of oranges and showers of rain
greeted them on their arrival in San Fran

more came to the City ana put up at the
Palace, and about the same number went
to the Grand.
The Chicago conductors and the ladles
of their party went to the Russ Huuse.

staff of assistants well in nand and
iiandied his guests in handsome style.
Every incoming conductor had a card
bearing the number of the room to which
he was assigned and boys stationed at the
head of the stairway and elevator landing
immediately escorted the guests to their
respective rooms. The special was late,
but the tables were spread in the dining

Aageles. ___^_^___^^__ [
BATTALION BOYS APLfrAT.
A Part j From the Naval Reserve Takes
a Run to Vallejo
The boys of the Second Division of the
Naval Battalion took a run up to Vallejo
on the schooner Rosie H, Captain Hanson,
Saturday evening and returned last even
ing. The return on time, however, was
mainly due to the ready assistance of
Captain A. C. Freese, the Public Ad
ministrator. The Rosie was becalmed off
Angel Island, and as she was about to
anchor Captain Freese hove in sight on
the tug Sea Witch, which he had chartered
for a plea ure party. He grasped the
situation, and witnout waiting to be asked
called for the Rosie's tow-line and look
her and her party after him to the City.
The run up to Vallejo was made in good
time, and there was plenty aboard, sup
plied by the division, to secure all human
comforti. Each battalion man was al
lowed one friend, and the party all told
numbered over fifty. It was under com
mand of Ensign Thomas Haslow of the
Second Division. The run down was be
fore a fresh wind at first, but it died down
just in time to leave the schooner in the
lee of Angel Island. Such trips will here
after be more frequent events.
The gray wolf is very destructive to
cattle in Montana, and sometimes over
powers and devonrs the strongest steers.
It instinctively shuns every form of trap.
Explanation.
The nrrow flics with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it. If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and liundredtbs.
during the past twelve hours, isobars, or solid
lines, connect po'n 9 of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "bieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and nuns.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure Is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low'- Is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

C ever Allopaths Cannot Disturb the
Ladies at Fabiola
Hospital.
Oakland Office Sax Fkancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 16. )
The time has now arrived for Oakland
to do something. During the past twelve
months many projects have been warmly
advocated and much preliminary work
done. But none of them have as yet be
come realities. The agitating of big
measures is always a benefit to a city be
cause of the interest it draws to itself from
the territory around it. Oakland has at
tracted considerable attention on account i
of the active manner in which many pro- :
jects have been attacked, but unless some- j
thing be done the opinion will go forth ;
that the people of this city are given to
talking rather than acting.
The tunnel road into Contra Costa
County has long been declared a necessity,
and naturally, owing to the development
of both Alameda and Contra Costa coun
ties, it was never more of a necessity than
at this time. Yet there is a disposition
on this side of the hill to allow the mat
ter to lie dormant rather than to press it,
and on the other side the feeling is the |
reverse. This should not be. Alameda
lias done most, of the talking, ana is by
far the wealthier county of the two, and
the tunnel road should be carried out at
once.
The remarks made at the last meeting
of the Supervisors by a member of the
board that the merchants of this City
6?em to imagine ttiey have only to po be
fore the Supervisors and ask an appropri
ation lor some public work and it should
be granted, indicate a wrong spirit. "What
the merchants in a body ask of local gov
ernment can pretty nearly always be
taken as indicating its necessity and
worth. The mercantile bodies of this City
are far more likely to be able to feel truth
fully the pulse of public necessity than a
quintet of officials whose duties are so
numerous that they cannot be well in
formed on everything connected with
their office.
It is this continued feeling of opposition
between official and mercantile cements |
that is causing the delay in many public
improvements. A careful glance through
tne immense mass of bills pass d by the
Supervisors each month will show that
everything the merchants ask could be j
carried out by a little judicious economiz
ing in many direc.ions.
The same is true of the municipal ex
penditures. For a long time everybody
has been demanding that Twelfth street,
from Broadway to Thirteenth avenue, be
made a magnificent driveway. It is a fine,
broad street, and there is at present little {
railroad track upon it. Two nights airo !
tne City Council voted that $500 be frittered '
away in each of die seven wards of the !
city in repairing the road?, so as to give I
â¢work to the unemployed. The principle j
of this action is rii;ht, but the practice is !
entirely wroisg, jadging by past experi- I
ence.' Instead of spending that amount
in each ward it would have been far more
sensible to have invested the $3500 in per
manently improving as much as possible
of the great hignway to East Oakland,
wh'ch is now the worst street ill Oakland. J
The improvements referred to and many |
others have been talked about too lon.-,
and so long as the means can be made
available they should be carried out.
Mr. Iteinhart, a delegate from the U.
C. to the annual convention of the P. A.
A., last Friday night at ths Reliance Club
made some very pointed remancs that !
have not appeared in any of the reports.
They were called out by a request from a
delegate of the Sacramento Athletic Ciub

to have an increase in the value of the
trophy, to allow training expenses and
traveling expenses and hotel bills to box

limits of the rounds.
Tnis brought Reinhart to his feet and !
he surprised everybody by making a mo- I

from $35 to $75 and that all these ex

and that it is ofien paid for in orders and
checks, which are as good as coin, so we
mijtht as well let the boxers have as much
as possible. As to traveling expenses and
other incidentals the amateur should be
permitted to have them. Of course, it
seems ridiculous to dream of an amateur
boxer going into training at the expense
of a club for the purpose of a boxing ex
hibition, but let it go. It may savor a
little of professionalism, but if we are to
encourage boxing let us do it openly and
broadly. Gentlemen, I call for my mo
tion.'
There was silence in the room, except
from the corner where the Sacramento
man sat. The great majority were awe
struck at Keinhart'i> boldness. Those
who were in favor of the radical change
were told to stan 1. About eight did so,
and Reinhart, to the surprise of some,
was not among them.
"I think the man who made the motion
should at least support it," said the Sac
ramento man.
But Reinhart moved not. He had
simply attempted to show by argument
the extent to which amateurism might go
if permitted. He had put up a big bluff
and the convention sustained it by about
four to one.
The ladies of Fabiola have proved that
they are not in politics. Mrs. John Yule,
the president, may be surprised at this
remark, but for fifteen years this state
ment has been proved annually.
The recent clever manner in which the
Board of Health was changed from home
opathic to allopathic proves clearly that,
even with a Mayor whose lite was paved
by a homeopath, the regulars can out
maneuver tneir rivals. No one will deny
that the regulars of Oakland arc far more
able politicians than their homeopathic
| brethren, for they have on many occa-ions
: demonstrated it. Not all that the astute
[ regulars can do, however, can gain for
j them one point in their long struggle
j against the lady managers ot Fabiola. No
political shatt or proiessionai thrust can
disturb them and the regulars have at
last abandoned the struggle and have
apparently withdrawn from practice at
mat institution.
Hud men controlled Fabiola, there is
tact and enerjjy enough among the regu
lars to fiave done as they pleased at the
hospital years ago. Bat the Oakland
regulars are men of honor and gallant to
the last degree, and many political tactics
that might have been employed against
men are, of course, barred against ladies.
This places the regulars at a doahle dis
advantage, and the ladies cannot be per
suaded to make any more concessions.
Ail of which makes it very certain that a
long time will elapse before the AlamcJa
County Medical Society wili indorse a lady
candiJate for Mayor.
And the intrepid ladies calmly said last
week, "Xheie things do not move us."

HIS BIG TASK.
Difficulty In Sight for Berkeley's Town-
Marshal In Carryi-ig Out a Xew
sanitary Ordinance.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 16.â Berkeley's
Town Marshal has a big contract on band
in the enforcement of a new ordinance
which the Town Trustees will put into
force at their next meeting. The law in
question regulates the conduct of laundries
in the town. Among other rules is the
following: "It is declare*' unlawful for
any person employed in a laundry or
wash house in tne town of Berkeley to
spray or moisten any clothes being ironed
or otherwise laundered with water or other
spr>iy from the mouth.
The university town has a number of
*mall laundries conducted by Chinese
who distribute moisture over clothes
which are in the process of ironing in the
time-honored Mongolian fashion. The
houses are of the usual Chinese order,
being small, dingy and secluded and hay- [
ing few windows. What few there are
are boarded up so that for the Marshal or
any one else 10 tell what is going on in
trie interior, where the industrious yellow
men toil, is a taik that would tax the
abilities of most any ofticer of the law.
The law provides that in violations of the
spraying ordinance a fine of not le s than
$25 nor more than $100 :-hall be imposed.
Ihe ordinance itself goes into effect in
about a week. M anwhile the Chinese
are spraying with their mouths to their
hearts' content.
The present one is Berkeley's first at
tempt to put a stop to the Mongolian
method of infusing moisture on the
clothes for the iron.
The new law also contains regulations
providing for inspection by the faeaith
officer of the premises to be used for
laundry purposes. If the inspection re
sults satisfactorily a certificate will be
issued upon t c payment of $5.

Clarrage and to his many acts of kindness

NOTES FOR THE
NATIONAL GUARD
Drilling the Cadets With
Riibs That Are too
Heavy for Them.
Some of the Local Companies Do
Not Make a Good Showing
at Inspection.
A Napa Company h Complimented by
th 9 Inspectorâ What the Signal
Corps, Third Brigade, Is Doing.
Lr.at week a National Guardsman asked
about the proposed changes and reforms
that the division commander had spoken
of when he assumed command. As an
nounced yesterday, the first of these sp
pears to be the vacat.on of the quarters in
tbe old building on Sansome street and
moving into the Baldwin Hotel. This will
be a far more central location, and it may
be the means of bringing the ranic of the
guard more in touch with the major
general.
As vet no cnoice has been made by the First
or Fifth Infantry as to a site for holding the
regimental encampment. Officers of each
regiment have been out looking for a suitable
place.
The exhibition drill by tho High School
Cadets last Saturday night proved the absu-d- !
ity of arming youths with the same character |
ol arms that are used by the adult members of
ether companies of the First Regiment of
Infantry, Second Brigade, to which the cadets j
are attached. The little fellows drilled for '
more than an hour wiih rifltis that weigh nine
pounds each, and before they were half
through the many maneuvers they were i
put through it was evident that tne i
arms they were using wero altogether I
too heavy for them. There are under the con- |
trol of the War Department of the United |
S'aU's stecks of wbat is known as tbe "cadet
rifle," such as have been furnished to the
cadet company at the University of California I
at Berkeley. They weigh about iinlf of j
those used last Saturday nipht and are just as i
serviceable. As to accuracy for target prac- !
tice it is asserted that they are superior to the |
bin guns. Il some superior officer of the First !
Regiment would interest himself in behalf of '
the cadets he could without trouble secure |
cadet rifles for tbe high school boys. The I
boys are anxious to drill and they drill we;L j
Captaiu Caning. on, U. S. A., inspector of the i
mintia, who was present at the muster of this j
company last week, remarked that the boys
drill as weh if not better than many of the
adult companies.
Next Wednesday the Veterans of the Na
tional Guard will hold an election for officers, j
and the banquet to be given by this associa- !
tion will be on the following Wednesday at j
the Occidental.
The Second Brigade.
During the past week several cf the com
panies of the First Regiment Infantry have j
been inspected. A majority of the companies i
made a fairly good showing as to numbers,
but the inspection as far as it has gone shows
that there has been a falling off In the nu
merical strength of of the companies, i
and if this continues in the same ratio as 111
has since the previous inspection some of thn I
captains will have to be notified that unless
they recruit up to the minimum strength
their companies will be mustered out.
Companies G and G will be inspected at the
Ellis-street armory this evening, and to-mor
row night Companies F and X will be in
epected. The inspection of tho Signal Corps
wiii take piace on Thursday evening next.
Troop A, Captain Jcuks commanding, has
been adding a number of new men to its ranks
of late.
NAPA, Cal., May 10.â The annual muster
and inspection of Company H, Fifth Regiment
Infantry, was held last Monday evening in i
the Armory on South Main street. Tae in-
Kpectiou was conducted by Major Charles Jan
sen of San Francisco, the brigade inspector.
Colonel D. B. Fairbanks and CaDtain. Maclay
oi Petaluma and Captain F. L. Carrington,
V. S. A., were also present. After the inspec
tion the company was put through the manual i
ol arms and military movements by Captain j
Â¥. W. Bush ara Lieutenant H. L. Gunn. I
Under the direction of Major Jansen, Sergeants
R. W. McKnight and W. W. Mugford and
Corporal F. W. Roberts drilled the company
in a very creditable manner.
The officers expressed themselves as well
pleased with the showing made by the com
pany. Major Jansen said to the officers:
"You should take great pride in your company I
and the armory In which you drill. You have '
the best armory in the regiment and, as far as
I know, the best company armory in the
fctate."
Captain Carrington, who has attended pre
vious inspections of the company, was much
pleased with the company's quarters. Colo
iiel Fairbanks and Captain Maclay compli
mented the men on their appearance. Colonel
Fairbanks commands the regiment to which
Company H belongs.
Napa takes a lively interest in the welfare of
her soldier boys ns shown by the laree num
ber of peop c who attended the inspection.
Regular drills are held on Monday evenings.

Signal Corps, Third Brigade.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 15.â The Signal \
Corps, Third Brigade, is actively engajted in |
preparation for the annual inspection, which i
takes place on the evening of Tuesday, the
18th.
Lieutenant-Colonel T. J. Hay, who will act
as inspecting officer, has highly complimented
the corps on its efforts in the way of helio
graphic work, and has signified hi 3 desire to
see the boys at work with the heliograph.
Lieutenant Msrtin has, therefore, detailed a
squad to go to Auburn oa .Saturday evening to
"opan" on the Capitol on Sunday morning and
has communicated with Colonei Hay, request
ing his presence.
Last Sunday morning was spent in helio
graph drill, setting up and adjusting single
and double glasses.
The boys are now discussing a suitable loca
tion for summer encampment, and should the
plan of distributing the three corps through
out the State b? not carried out, it is likely
that either Lake Tahoe or Summit faoda
Springs will be decided upon.
Should Troop |B hav^ a field day on Sun
day and Monday, the 30th Â»nd 31*t, there is a '
possibility of the corps joining tnem.
The. corps is rapid. y filling up to its quota of j
twenty-one men, three new members hfiving
been received last week, one of whom was
formerly a member ol the organization.

SPRING SHOWERS FELL
C;ty Pleasure-Seekers Soaked
Before They Could Get
Home.
The Rain Was Receiv.d With Satis
faction and Cisgnst by the
Farming Community.
Alexander McAdie of the Weather
Bureau gave the people warning early
yesterday morning that daring the day
there might be local showers. The people
heeded not tiie warning, but went fortn in
the morning attired in silt-, laces aud gay
Easter bonnets, plug hats and thin thoes.
In ihe afternoon they returned with
ruined garments, soppy head-gear and
soaked feet, for which they unjustly
blamed the weather prophet.
Tbe rain began to fail between 4 and 5
o'clock in the afternoon, and the down
pour held on nearly all night. Those who
went into the country to picnics and upon
pleasure bent returned wet to the skin, for
none were prepared lor a shower.
The downpour was by no means local,
for t li â¢Â» moist area extended all over tbe
southern part of the northern half of tbe
State and even into the southern pan.
This was caused by the pressure of high
temperature hanging over the Pacific In
many parts of the State the rain will be a
benefit to the crowing crops, but In other
parts the effect will be otherwise. Cher
ries, strawberries and similar "garden
truck" just beginning to ripen will be in
jured, Dut to what extent is not yet
known. To the late fruits it can do no
injury, but is more likely to be well re
ceived by the orchardis.s. In some sec
tions the standing grain has been
"iodged" by southerly winds. Last even
ing reports* at the weather bureau indi
cated that in Northern California ti* rain
had not passed, but that early in the
morning occasional showers and possibly
thunder-storms might occur. However,
it is believed that the major part of to
day will be fair locally and that in the
valleys it will be warmer, with southerly
winds.

FAIR MAYE
DENIES THE
IMPUTATION
Did Not Intercept Lillian
Blair's Letters to
Barillas.
SHE KNEW HER NOT
AS A RIVAL.
But, Then, the Gallant General
Gave All the Girls Costly
Presents.
LILLIAN PRESUMED FAR TOO
MUCH.
Interpreter Rib is Tells His Story
While All the Rest Are Out
W ith Denials.
If the warm, young heart of Lillian
Blair pitta-patted on the mention of Gen
eral Barillas' name, and if the millionaire
Guatemalan in turn yearned for the fair
Lillian while he was absent from her in
far-off Europe, pretty Maye Taber was in
entire ignorance of it.
Now, if there had been anything of the
kind going on, Mave would have come
pretty near knowing it, for she was a
member oi' the party which accompanied
him from this City 10 the old country and
enjoyed his every confidence. Maye says
she never heard of Lillian Blair, and has
reasons lor believing that the opulent and
lavish general bad only a slight ac
quaintance with the cigar-store girl, if
any at all. Certainly the general was
never heard to mention Lillian Blair
during the European tour, and certain it
is, too, that he didn't write any letters to
her, for he does not write Dor speak a
word of Englis â¢.
The letters Lillian received were written
by Kibas, who was at that time private
secretary and interpreter for Barillas, and
Miss Taber hasher doubts as to whether
or not the general ever dictated or author
ized them. Lillian may have written to
him, but if that were the case her pushing
missives, accompanied by requests for
more money, went direct to Ribas, and :f
the latter individual ieit so inclined he
rtad them to the general. Miss Taber is
positive ihat she never in tercepted any of
Lillian's letters â never even thought of
such a thing. How could she, when she
d d not even Know the girl who had fallen
victim to the Guatemalan's dazzling
Monte Cristo splendor nor know that he
even had an acquaintance with, such a
girl? And, furthermore, she could not
have influenced Ribas to withhold Lillian's
affectionate requests from ihe general, be
cause slie and Ribas were at swords'
points throughout the tour.
Maye Taber is as charming and beauti
ful a girl as one could find in a year's
journey, even if he were on a special ex
pedition in search of damsels upon whom
nature had been extraordinarily generous
in the lavishment of chaims. Her pink
and-white complexion, great, deep blue
eyes, and graceful form, are enough to in
spire all the poets of the land. Not only
this, but she is highly accomplished,
speaking several languages fluently, is
vivacious, and altogether charming in
manner. Now Maye's friends assert that
it was she who occupied the place of
honor in the general's heart, and that no
Lillian Blair ever stood a ghost of a
chance to usurp the envied sconce.
They snicker at the very idea that
the airy, fairy Lillian should
have presumed so much, even
if she did receive a few diamonds and
other presents from the ex-Pres;dent ol
Guatemala. He had a habit of scattering
presents like these everywhere, and, they
bay, for a girl to imagine that because she
harjpened to be one of the many thus
favored the general had fallen desperately
in love with her was idiotic. No. no; he
thought of none but Maye. Why, didn't
he insist upon her accompanying him to
Europe? Didn't she ride in state with
him through the boulevards oi gay Paiee,
and didn't he strut and swell with pride
when he heard all of Europe raving over
her beauty ? How couht he help adoring
her? There was no chance for Liliian
there.
Miss Taber is herself rather disinclined
to permit herÃelf to be mixed up in the
malodorous scandal stirred up by Attor
ney Dimond's demand that Miss Blair
pay him for drawing up the papers in a
breach-of-pronr.se suit intended to be
launched at the head of the Guatemalan
Croesus. She parted company with the
general in New York some little time ago
ana returned to this City, while he jour
neyed to Central America. When seen
yesterday in her apartments at the
Colonial Miss Tab-r was quite prostrated
over the lact that her name had been
dragged into the megs, and that Lillian
Blair had accused her of intercepting her
letters.
"Dear me, but this is really dreadful,' 1
said she. "Why, do you know I never
knew that such a gin as Lillian Blair
ever existed uni.il 1 read this awful scan
dal, nnd I was never cognizant that the
general was acquainted witn her. Ido
not say that he was not, for lie became
acquainted with hundreds oi people whiie
here. But as for his having been desper
ately in love with her, why that is arrant
nonsense. Surely some of our party
would have known something about it.
"Now, as to her assertion that I ever in
tercepted her letters to him, I wish to
brand that as being absolutely untrue. I

never knew that she wrote to him. Be
sides, Rtbns received all of the general s
mail and wrote most of his letters. In
fact he wrote many letters that the gen
eral never knew anything about. But
then that is neither here nor there.
"Miss Blair presumed too much when
she imaginedâ if she didâ that the een
eral was madly devoted to her just be
cause he gave her presents. Why, he lav
ished presents upon everybody, and costly
ones at that. He thought nothing of giv
ing diamonds to ladies who were almost
strangers to him and whom he never
thought of aeain. It was an every-day
occurrence with him. Why, he spent
$70,000 right here in San Francisco alone.
"As to this Blair scandal, the first inti
mation we had that trouble was brewing
was upon our arrival in New York after
returning from Europe. The general re
ceived a telegram irom Castle Brothers
and Mr. Hirsch, warning him not tore
turn by way of San Francisco, as there
was a conspiracy on foot to black
mail him out of a large sum of
money. It contained no furher
particulars. The general was thunder
struck and wired back for something more
definite. They could or would tell him
no more, however, and he left us for
Panama still in ignorance of what was on
foot out here. He is still in the dark, for
I ha7e received several telegrams from
him, and so has Mr. Hirsch, asking for
information. He will be hopping mad
when he gets the details of this scandal
ous affair. lam very sorry for him, lor
he is too good a man to deserve such treat
ment."
Ri ban does not occupy an altogether en
viable position in the recent disclosures,
particularly in connection with the story
told by Attorney Diniond. Ribas lost his
job with the general during that Euro
pean tour. He and Miss Taber had a fall
ing out duiing the trip and each pro
ceeded to "knock" the other with the
general. The young lady came out victo
rious and Ribas was sent 10 this city.
But Ribas is still loyal to Barillas, and
declares that the whole Blair story wa3 a
blackmailing scheme concocted by un
scrupulous people. He denies emphati
cally that the Blairs were "bought off,"
or that they were induced by means of
promises to abandon the suit aeainst
Barillas that was to be handled by Law
yer I'iinond.
The other ramifications of the scandal
have simmered down to a series of de
nials. Lillian Blair, when seen yester
day, said she had nothing to add to her
first statement except to reiterate that
her letters to the general were inter
cepted, and that she still loved the gen
eral and believes he still loves her. She
asserts that she was led by deceitiul and
designing people into consenting to sue
the general, but abandoned the idea the
moment she discovered the real motives.
Sue denies emphatically, and so do all the
Blairs, that money was paid for their affi
davits clearing Barillas of all liability lor
damages. Miss Lilian says again that she
knew all along that the general was a
married man and was in no way deceived
by him in that regard.
Attorney Eisner says that his connec
tion with the affair was not other than
that of the friend and adviser of Louis
Hirsch, General Barillas' business agent
in this City. He denies positively that in
the procurement cf the Blair affidavits
any money was used. They were purely
voluntary statements, made when the par
ties found that they had been used as
catspaws by others. Mr. Hirach says the
same thing.
Attorney Dimond, however, adheres to
his original statement that he was re
tained by the B'airs to push the damage
suit against Barillas in all sincerity, and
declares that he in no way sought the
task. He still professes to believe that
his client was "influenced ' to dÂ»sert him
and repudia;e the proposed litigation, and
reitera.es his declaration that Eisner and
Hirsch do not dare to give the affidavits
to the public.
RIBAS HAS HIS SAY.
He Tells of the Connection Be
tween General Barillas and
Lillian Blair.
Armando Kibas, who was secretary to
General Barillas on the occasion of the
millionaire's la?t visit to this City, and
who accompanied him on his trip to
Europe, has figured in print to no small
extent in connection with the Blair-
Barillas scandal.
The particular dart fired by the enemy
which hurt him into making public his
knowledge ol the Blair-Barillas scandal
was the assertion that he was an ordinary
holel-runner. Even the allusion to him
as General Barillas' Sancho Panza was
waved off with an accompanying shake
of the head and a sneer.
"That is nothing to me," he said, ''every
body knows better. But," he added, "I
feel that since I am attacked, I can speak
in behalf of General Barillas and the
Blair family, who have been placed in
such an unfortunate position through
Attorney Dimond's statement.
"If anybody is to be blamed in the mat
ter it is not the other people, but I. 1 in
troduced Qeneral Barillas to Miss Lillian
Blair, and as their interpreter I con
ducted their correspondence. The gen
eral couldn't write or speak English, and
she couldn't speak or write Spanish. But
they both cared a great deal for euch
other, and I interpreted their feelings one
to the other.
"The day we went East and to Europe â
I mean the general, his son Alfanso, Miss
MayeTaberand her mother â I gave Mrs.
Blair $800 cash to cover their expenses of
living while the general was away. We
Mr. Ribas, General Barillas' Amanuensis, Is Not a "Runner."
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: I have carefully read the statement made by
Attorney Dimond and published in the morning papers regarding the affairs of Gen
eral Barillas, the Blair family and myself. While there is some element of truth in
what he says, the main portion of it is not founded upon facts. The entire matter, I
have no hesitancy in saying, is a blackmailing scheme on the part of unscrupulous
people. The Blairs were at fir>t misled by these fellows, but upon their eyes being
opened as to the true purpose of General Barillas' enemies they withdrew voluntarily
and without financial or other compensation for so doing.
As regards mysel r , the statements of Attorney Dimond are positively ridiculous.
I would therefo:e ask tha: you state for me that not only am I not a "runner" for the
Occidental or Palace hotels, but have never been. My station in this community and
everywhere I chose to reside is well known by the best people of Central and South
Amorica, Spain, Portugal and France, with whom I have always associated on a foot
ing of friendship aad not that of a subaltern. Respectfully yours, A, RIB AS.

only expected to be away four months,
and I believed $200 a month would see
them through all right until we returned.
"Instead of lour months we remained
away nearly seven. I wns obliged to return
from Europe here, and I met some friends
who told me Miss Blair was about to bring
suit against the General. At first I was
inclined to doubt tuis as I knew that he
had been a very preat friend of hers, but
when I met Miss Blair on the street and
she did not deny tho rumor I felt there
was something wrong.
"A few days later I met a relative of
Mis^ Maye Taber on the street.
"The man was wild at what he consid
ered was a terrible injury done to him and
bis family.
"He threatened to sue General Barillas
and make trouble for him in many ways
when he returned. He not only told me
this, but he told it to many business men
down town, and I thought it advisable to
write to the general and advise him not to
return by way of this City.
"Some lime after that I received an in
vitation to cail upon Mr. Schwerin of the
Mail Company. That gentleman up
braided me for urging the Blairs in a suit
against General Barillas.
"I told Mr. Schwerin that my friend
ship for the general was such that any
body touching a hair in his nead would
have to tear the eyes out of my head. He
related his understanding of the Blair
trouble, and I went out and saw Mrs.
B air. We had a long talk over it,
although she at first wanted to refer me to
her attorneys. I pointed out to her the
uselessnesd of a suit, as General .barillas
did not live in this State, and showed to
her the ingratitude she would display
after all he bad done for her and her chil
dren should she stand in with the general's
enemies, who cared only to blackmail
him.
"The ladies authorized me to see the at
torneys, which I did, and withdraw the
suit. That is all there is to that. There
was not a single dollar spent to buy the
suit off, nor was there any inducement of
any other kind offered. The ladies simply
realized they were being used in a black
mailing scheme, and they refused to lend
themselves to it.
"General Barillas met Miss Blair here
ana formed an attachment for her. In
stead of remaining only a few weeks in
this City he stayed several months, dur
ing whicn time he devoted most of his
spsre moments to her. Mrs. Blair was
away when they first met, but, later on,
when the girl used to call at his rooms at
Delmonico's, Mrs. Blair knew all about it
and never raised an objection,
"lean state positively now that Gen
eral Barillas will not submit to black
mail, but I can also say that he is not the
man to allow Mi's Blair or her family to
be in want. He liked them all very much,
and they have done right by him La re
pudiating the suit his enemies would have
caused them to bring. You can rest as
sured that he will not see them in want.
Miss Lillian is a capable girl, and she will
soon have a good situation."
GOVERNOR BUDD
SEES FOR HIMSELF
He Visits Witnesses and
Views the Scene of the
Lamont Murder.
Mrs. Vogel, Martin Quinlan and
Mrs. Noble are Fully
Interviewed.
The B-lfry and Church Environments
Will Be Visited by the Gov
ernor To-Day.
Governor Badd put in several hours yes
terday in making personal investigations
of tbe evidence in the Durrant case, espe
cially with reference to the scene of tbe
crime and tbe distance from the Normal
School and other points to the church.
Tbe Governor went to the church, but
as services were in progress he decided to
make no examination of the belfry and
other points until to-day.
To satisfy himself as to the credibility
of witnesses the Governor saw Mrs. Vogel
and Attorney Martin Quiulan, two wit
nesses whose evidence was of vital im
portance, the former swenring that she
saw Durrant in front of her house for half
an hour before the Normal School closed
on April 3; tbe latter tnat he snw Dur
rant and a girl going toward tho church
about 4p. m of the same day. Mrs. Vogel
s'.'o swore that a man, whom she identi
fied as Darrant, joined two young ladies
when the school adjourned. He also
saw Mrs. Noble.
The witnesses seen yesterday told Gov
ernor Buck! tbe same stories they swore
to at the trial and were not in any doubt
on the points involved.
The State's chief executive also rode
over the route from the school to the
church, and made the trip in about the
time alleged by the prosecution as beinc
necessary tor such a journey. He care
fully scrutinized the church and its sur
roundings, especially with reference to
the view-point from which Mrs. Caroline
Leake said she saw Durrant enter the
church.
"I propose to make the most thorough
investigation possible," said Governor
Budd last night, "for the case is one of
great importance, and I do not want to be
accused of reaching a decision in haste."
The Governor will visit the church this
morning.
DX. GIANNINI BETORTS.
He Gives Hi* Side of the La Berge
Scandal.
Dr. Giannini of the City and County
Hospital feels much aggrieved that Dr.
de Pay took occasion to criticize the con
duct of hospital physicians in the case of
Charles La Jtferge, who says he had a
fractured riband was treated for concus
sion only.
Speaking of the case yesterday Dr.
Giannini said: "Dr. I. W. Thome and
myself found no fractures and our exam
ination was confirmed by Surgical Dresser
O'Connor, a man of thirty years' ex
perience. La Berge was drunk and noisy,
and I did threaten to put him out because
he was disturbing other patients. His wife
said she had plenty of money, so I told
her if that were true her husband ought lo
have an outside doctor."
Dr. De Puy furniihcs The Call the fol
lowing statement:
San Francisco, Cal., May IG, 1897.
I wish to say that the statement attributed
to me in this m< rnlug's Call in regard to the
case of LaÃeree and reading as follows: "Any
one ol ordinary ability should have discovered
the fracture," was uttered without due con
sideration and without the intention ot reflect
ing upon the ability of the pnysictans who
attended him at the hospital, in whose compe
tency I have perfect confidence.
Though to my statement that the man's ribs
were fractured I positively adhere, but ouly
arrived at that conclusion after a very careful
and thorough examination.

streets of the City become n permanen t feature
of the municipality. The various improve

TINY LINGUISTS
IN VAUDEVILLE
Clever Performance by Chil
dren of the Italian
School.
They Act and Sing With Equal
Facility in Two Lan
guages.
An Appreciative Audienca Enj>ys
Their Entertainment at the
Bush Street
The Bush-street Theater was turned
into a regular kindergarten last evening.
Children were the performers on the
stage and there was scarcely a man or
woman in tha audience who was not ac
companied by one or more members of
the rising generation.
The occasion was a grand "recita'
given by children belonging to the Italian
Free School. The little people speak
English as to the manner born, but they
are in the habit of devoting an hour or
two every afternoon to the study of the
language of Dante, and their performance
yesterday, which was all in the Italian
tongue, showed that they have completely
mastered it.
The chief play on the bill was a sort of
vaudeville, describing iha mischievous
adventures of a band of students in the
university of Padua. From all accounts
they entirely discounted any daredevil
deeds recounted of American university
students. Their special victim was the
neb uncle of one of their number. In
order to "bleed" this plutocrat tor the
wherewithal to indulge in dances and
nocturnal suppers the students went so
far as to let the nephew go through a
mock death and made the rich uncle
come down handsomely for funeral ex
penses.
There was plenty of moveme.it in this
play, and it was interspersed with danc
ing and singing. The children entered
into their parts with ztsl and did some
splendid work.
A good many laurels rested on the brow
of Miss Llaudina Ghibaudi, a three-year
old prima donna, who quite brought down
the house by ber singing and reciting.
Miss P. Mci took the part of the nephew
who died in order to wring money from
his uncle for funeral expenses. She was
a very dashing and vocally melodious
nephew, and proved more than a match
for her connding relative all through the
performance. The roles of the nephew's
most mischievous fellow-students and the
servants, cooks, etc., who ministered to
their extravagances, were skillfully im
personated by Miss G. Ghibaudi, Miss A.
Cerruti, It. Pfllettieri, R. Ferroggiaro, L.
Motroni, E Brusco, N. Ferrogiaro, U.
Sovio, G. tfanchiero, C. Massoero, C. Fer
rea, E. Cassella, M. Ferrogiaro. G. Banch
ero, V. Motroni, E. Paganini, L. Paganini,
G. Ferrea. A. Mci, E. Brusco, R. Pellet
tier!, A. Oosella and L. Landucci.
The vaudeville was preceded by an
amusing curtain-raiser in which a little
10-year-oid girl, Miss A. Ghibaudi, played
the principal role in a very artistic and
natural way. Her support, which con
sisted of adults, included Mrs. I. Ghibaudi,
Miss G. Massoero, E. l'ellaro, F. Maimone
and E. Gastaidi. Great credit for ttie suc
cessful performance was due to Mrs.
Ghibaudi*, the stage manageress and di
rectress.
The entertainment went off so well that
it will probably be repeated in English, as
the children are as much at home in that
language.
HANDBALL GAMES.

BENSON'S WATCH.
It Was Twice Stolon and Twice Recov
ered by Officer Ryan.
Edward Benson, a saloonkeeper on
Third street, is the owner of a valuable
watch which has been taken from him on
two occasions by picicpockets, and on both
occasions the timepiece was recovered by
O ftice T. L Ryan.
On the first occurrence the watch was
stolen by Frank Stocking, a notorious
criminal, who while on his way to Folsom
State Prison escaped from the Deputy
Sheriff having him in charge in Sacra
mento, but was afterward caught and is
now uoing time. On that occasion Officer
Ryan recovered the watch from the man
to whom Stocking sold it for $50.
This same watch was taken out of
Benson's pocket while he was asleep in
tbe back room of a saloon on Third and
Howard street last Saturday.
The case wax reported to Ryan, who ar
rested Henry Matthewson on Third street
yesterday afternoon, and on searching
him found a pawnticket with the number
of Benson's watch on it.
Matthewson acknowledged being the
thief, and stated that he had but recently
anved in this City from Petaiuma.

EIGHTY-THREE
YEARS THIS DAY
It Is the Anniversary of
the Freedom of
Norway.
A Grand Celebration to Be Held
To-Night by Den Norske
Forening.
More Than Eight Decades of a Pros
perity of Which Other Countries
Might Be Proud.
<
The Norwegians of this City will cele
brate to-night the eighty-third anniver
sary of their independence from the
Danish yoke.
Therewilt be a banquet and literary ex
ercises and dancing later in the evening
at Union-square Hall under the auspices
of Den Norske Foreninz.
There are probably 2000 Norwegian resi
dents of this City and five limes that num
ber residents of the Slate, and in every
little hamlet as well as aboard every vessel
carrying a Norwegian crew on this coast
will toasts be arunk to the continued pros
perity of the old home.
George Heinemann, secretary of Dsn
Norske Forening, in speaking of the
celebration, stated with all the warmth of
the true potriot:
"We have every reason to rejoice and
celebrate upon this day. Just think of
it! Eighty-three years of liberty, during
which tbere has been nothing but con
tinuous prosperity.
"Aside from Switzerland ours is the
only country that has not had a war in
that time, and we have done much to en- \
lighten and benefit the world in that time
in all branches of literature, music, paint
ing and science.
"We are proud in literature of Ibsen,
Bjornson and Jonas Lie. In painting we
point to Tiedmand, Werenskjold, Eckers
berg and Arbo. Ole Bull is now dead in
body, but he still lives, and Edvard Grieg
is now the European furore. I need not
mention to you our Nanseu, the explorer.
"These are the geniuses we have pro
duced in eighty-three years of peace and
prosperity, and we are abreast of any
nation.
"Norway owns her own railway", elec
tric plants, whether streetcars, lignt, tele
phones or telegraph, as well as the gas,
and all departments are conducted under
civil service regulations.
"One feature of which we are particu
larly proud is our public schools in which
the children are furnished with one bot
meal at noontime each day at the expense
of the Government."
The programme to-night will be the ad
dress of welcome by President M. S. Mop,
address by Klaus Olsen; "Norway, 1 by H.
Grotscbier, and "America," by George
Heinemann. ____ââ
