PARIS. France, May 4.â The grand Bazaar dcs Charities, inaugurated yes
" terday, ended this afternoon in a disaster which caused the loss of at least 200
lives and which has thrown many of the best known families In France and other
Continental countries into mourning.
The flimsy structure in the Rue Jean Goujon, in which the bazaar was held,
built entirely of planks and cloths, caught fire at 4:30 o'clock and in a few
minutes was reduced to a heap of ashe?.
Fully 1800 people were in tbe bazaar at the time. There was a wild rush for
the exits, which were quickly blocked with struggling masses of humanity, and
many of those seeking to escape were knocked down and trampled to death, while
others were suffocated in the awful crush.
The roof collapsed shortly after the fire started, burying scores who were still
struggling to escape.
Among the dead are many leaders of Continental society. It is reported that
several English and American visitors were also cremated. Among the reported
missing is the Duchesse 'I' Alencon, a sister of the Empress of Austria and the wife
of Prince Ferdinand of Orleans. The Duchess d'Dzes was injured.
. Among those killed were:

VIEW OF VELESTINO AND VICINITY, Where the Greeks Under General Smolinski Have So
Successfully Withstood the Assaults of the Turkish Columns.
The little city of Velestino lies in the gap or depression between the Kara Dagh Mountains on the west and Mount Plessidhi (the ancient Pelion)on the east,
through which runs the railroad from Volo to Larissa. It is situated on a kind of low plateau and surrounded on three sides by hills. The* point of view is from the hill
to the south, and the field includes the southeastern extremity of the plain, which extends to Larissa and the Peneus River. To the right, just below the city, is its sta
tion on the railroad to Pharsala and just beyond the junction of that road with the one to Larissa. On the plain, just beyond the junction, on both sides the road are
earthworks, thrown up by the Greeks, supported by batteries on the bills to the rear. On the right of the gap, on the rocky cliff, is the Greek battery which was so fiercely
assaulted on Sunday, and to the left are seen the Grecian and Turkish batteries which engaged in the sharp duel yesterday.

The injured include: Duchesse de Latorre, Vicomtesse d'Avenel, Comtesse de

Bire; Mesdames de Macedo, Dubreuil, Recamier, De Challemel, Malezieux, and
Comte de Montclair, Comte dv Vesia, Baronne de Lissingen, Comtesse d'Hora
and daughter.
Tne bazaar was held by a representative syndicate of the chief charitable
institutions, which every year unite for the purpose of celling all kinds of articles,
the profits from which are devoted to tbe relief of the poor. The receipts each
year have amounted to about 1,000.000 francs.
The fire started in a cinematograph installation near the stall of the Duchesse
d'Uzes. It is supposed the fire originated from an imperfectly insulated electric
wire. ....
The flames spread with such frightful rapidity that the building was almost
immediately a raging furnace. The fire started immediately after the departure
of Mgr. Clari, Papal Nuncio, who attended the function for the purpose of giving
his blessing.
The building had eight exits. The place where the fire started was on the
left side of the structure, and the visitors and those attending the stalls rushed
for the exit on the right. In the mad panic which followed, every one, with a few
noble exceptions, fought for his own life.
The majority of the dead seem to have been mercifully suffocated before
being burned. In the awful struggle to get out of the building most of the ladies
who escaped lost part of their clothing. Some of them were almost nude, their
skirts and petticoats being stripped off. As they rushed out of the burning
structure they fell swooning in the street.
More than 150 escaped through a window of the Hotel dv Palais, upon which
the bazaar building backed.
Nachtel, the director of the ambulances, says he saw a group of corpses seated
witb their heads burned off. '*', " ,*'
â¢ Mme. Lucie Faure, daughter of the President, escaped, owing to her making a
call on her way to the bazaar. Her parents suffered cruel anxiety for more than
an hour. Mme. Lucie arrived on the scene after the roof fell. -
The firemen and gendarmes were promptly on hand, but when they arrived
the building was in ruins and all their efforts were directed to removing the dead
and injured. â¢ '-.' â  -â¢â¢â¢ :; 'â¢ ' *
From the stories told by the survivors it is learned that the dresses of a number
of ladies-caught fire before they scarcely hail an opportunity to attempt to escape,
and their shrieks of agony as they ran hither and thither in blind terror added to
the panic. They ran into crowds near the exits, and in this manner the fire
communicated to the clothing of others, who either perished miserably or were *
frightfully burned. . -. - * Â« .*â¢ ;
The bodies thus far recovered have been removed to the Palais de l'lndustrie,
close to the scene of the fire. It will be impossible to identify all, many of them ..
being burned beyond recogntion. Some of them were completely carbonized,
while others were without heads or limbs.
So far as can be learned about 500 persons were enveloped in .the flames, the'
others in the building having managed to effect an escape before the fire gained
great headway. A hundred and fifty seriously injured have been taken to the
hospitals or are being treated at their homes.
The ruins are still smoking to-night. Until they have cooled sufficiently to
allow a thorough search it will be impossible to know the extent and number of
the victims.
Great crowds -gathered at the fire, but could render no assistance to the
imprisoned people owing to the intensity of the heat. Twenty minutes after the
fire was discovered the building was wholly destroyed.
The excitement in Paris was hardly imaginable. Everybody seemed to forget
to dine, and the theaters were virtually empty. Thousands of persons from all
parts of the city rushed to the Champs Elysees, and the, crowd in the streets
leading to the Rue Jean Goujon resembled that which assembled in the Place de
ft
la Concorde on September 4, 1870. â 
There were distressing scenes around tne Palace de l'lndustrie, where the
bodies and fragments of bodies were deposited. Scores of persons were awaiting
admission to seek for the identity of relatives. Dozens were admitted at a time,
but the improvised mortuary was so full it was impossible to meet the demands
fast enough. Many were sobbing, while others were laughing hysterically or ac
cusing the police of cruelty in excluding them, j *. *-" -*
Every, time a number of persons were admitted groans 1 were raised .by those
left behind. A reporter who entered says policemen walked to and fro with
lighted torches, the smoke from which make everything blurred and indistinct,
like a London fog.
Hurdles were fixed around the ball, on the other side of which were heaps of
apparently old clothes, though a close inspection showed they, were unrecogniza

ble bits of bodies. In the center of the room was a pile of deal coffins.
About one hundred bodies have been recovered, and it is believed that at least
another hundred are vet under the ruins.
As news of the disaster spread hundreds of carriages went streaming along
the Champs Elysees, conveying people seeking relatives. Within a half hour
there were witnessed indescribable scenes of grief. One lady on reaching the
scene went mad.
The building was about 300 feet long and 200 wide. The interior represented a
street of medieval Paris buildings and tbe decorations ot which were bought
from the managers of preceding exhibitions by Baron Mackau and presented to
the syndicate for the occasion. The shops and houses with their quaint balconies
and peaked gables were utilized as stalls for a display of costly and beautiful
fabrics.
The lists of the dead and wounded are very incomplete, and those cabled may
possibly prove incorrect here and there. No two are alike. â 
Some reports say the Duchesse d'Alencon certainly perished, while others
deny this. The Duke d'Alencon was injured.
Viscomtesse d'Avenel, who is now said to be dead, was the wife of the cele
brated writer for the Revue dcs Deux Mondes.
Mme. de Flores, reported dead, was the wife of the Spanish Consul. .
No Americans have been identified among the dead, nor are any definitely de
clared to be missing. Miss Elsie Bushbeck of Philadelphia was in the building,
but escaped.
One of the many rumors impossible to verify in the â¢ confusion says the
Countess of Castellane (Anna Gould) was in the building. '
DON, Eng., May 4.â A Paris dispatch to the Chronicle says Mgr. Clari,
Papal Nuncio, is missing. Six Dominican monks perished. The dispatch adds the
first estimates of the loss of life were far below actuality. The Prefecture of Police
believes 350 perished. The Times says many foreigners were among the stall
keepers, including a number of English and Americans. It adds it is feared some
of them are among the victims.
DEATH OF REAR-ADMIRAL MEADE.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 4.â Admiral Richard Worsam Meade, retired, of
the United States navy, died to-day. His record as a navy oflicer has been full of
heroism and adventure. He was born in New" York City October 9, 1837-* He en
tered the navy as a midshipman October 2, 1850, On January 23. 1858, he became
a lieutenant. He was made lieutenant-commander on July 16,* 1862.; He reached
the rank of commander September 20, 1868, and became a captain March 13. 1880.
He was raised the rank of commodore May 5, 1892, and on September 7, 1894, he
became a rear-admiral. 7 Daring the civil war he served on the Mississippi River
arid in the .South Atlantic and Western i Gulf blockading squadrons. He was
highly commended in the official dispatches for skill and . gallantry. 'Admiral

KING GEORGE IS BITTER*
AGAINST THEM.
Prefers Direct Negotiation
With the Sultan to the
Go cert.
GROWING BELIEF THAT THE
WAR IS NEARLY OVER.
First Will Come an Armistice and
Then the Intervention That Is
Certain to Follow.
[Copyrighted 1897, By the New York Snn.]
LONDON. England, May 4.â The im
pression grows stronger in all quarters
that the submission of Greece to Turkey
and the powers will soon be forthcoming.
It is not expected to take the form of
suing for peace or mediation â the latter
the least of all, for the Greek feeling is
more bitter against the concert of Europe
than against Turkey.
King George would prefer to negotiate
direct with the Sultan than through the
powers. Indeed, he declared recently he
would never under any circumstances
seek the intervention of Europe.
It is not unlikely the end of the hostili
ties will take the form of a brief armistice.
This gained, nobody believes the fighting
will ever be resumed. Instead of hoping
for Turkish success, official Europe is now
earnestly desirous the Greeks should gain
some advantage in the field. The inter
ests of Europe were considered best served
by the Turkish victories at the outset of
the war. Now" the situation is reversed.
The Sultan is naturally convinced he is
invincible, and daily becomes more de
fiant.
Reliable information from Constantino
ple is to the effect that he now refuses to
listen to lesser terms than the return of
Crete, a cessation of the bulk of Thessaly
and a transfer of half of the Greek navy.
Emperor William and others who incited
him to try to beat the Greeks are likely to
repeat when they find the Eastern prob
lem rendered immensely more difficult
instead of simplified by the war. A ten â¢
vine Greek victory at the present moment
would, therefore, be received with joy in
European chancelleries because of its
double effect of restoring the Greek self
respect and checking Turkish obstinacy.
England, as Curzon announced in the
House of Commons to-day, is again press
ing the question of intervention, this time
with success. It is beginning to be recog
nized at St. Petersburg, Berlin and Vienna
that the political friendship of England
and France will become a genuine factor
in the situation, and its influence is al
ready felt. It is no secret that England is
in favor of stopping the war instantly at
any cost and of restoring the status quo
ante bellum in every respect. France
practically indorses the policy of Salis
bury.
ENGLAND IS ANXIOUS.
Curzon Says It Is the Desire of the
Powers to Terminate the
War.
LONDON, Eng., May 4.â ln the House
of Commons to-day Curzon said com
munications concerning the situation in
the East were passing between the powers.
It was impossible at this time for him to
announce the character of the communi
cations, but he was at liberty to say it is
the earnest desire of all to terminate the
war now being waged between Greece and
Turkey. It was obvious, however, the
first essential would be for tbe belligerents
to accept the powers' intervention.
ATHENS, Greece, May 4.â A prolonged
Cabinet council was held to-day to hear
reports from Minister of War Tzamavos
and Minister of the Interior Theotokia,
who have just returned from an inspec
tion of the Greek - array at Pharsala.
Nothing is known regarding the conclu
sions reached, but the Acropolis infers

Ministers decided the contest cannot be
continued.
Another report says that immediately
after their arrival here the two Ministers
had a long interview with Premier Ralli,
who afterward declared the Government
bad never entertained an idea of the
Greeks retreating. The morale of the
army at Pharsala was pronounced excel
lent and that of the army of Velestino
was charactered by the visiting Minis
ters as brilliant.
Colonel Vassos, lately in command of
the Greek army of occupation in Crete,
will succeed Colonel Manos in command
of the Greek forces at Arta.
BERLIN. Germany, May 4.â lt is said
here that Empress Frederick has com
plained to the Emperor of his allowing
German officers to be sent to the frontier
to assist the Turks, and especially their
artillery service, In reoly the Emperor
is said to have remarked that the Greeks
might also have. had German officers had
they asked for them, and that it was
greatly to their disadvantage that they
had not done so. The Greeks, he said,
had excellent artillery and with German
officers to direct their guns they would
have been superior to the Turks.
WAR TO THE END.
Decision of the Greek Ministry
After Official Reports From
the Front.
LONDON, Eko., May 4.â An Athens
â¢ dispatch to the Times says: The Govern
ment has resolved upon continuing war.
This decision was reached after the arrival
of Colonel Tsmavos, Minister of War, and
Thoetoki, Minister of the Interior, who
were sent to Pharsala to learn the con
dition of the army, which is being
materially re-enforced. Colonel Constan
tinides. now in Crete, has been appointed
chiei of staff. The dispatch concludes with
the statement that it is difficult to say
whether the momentous decision of the
Government is absolutely final.
A dispatch from Larissa dated May 1
says that the road from Salonica leading
southward is filied with TurKish troops,
hastening forward to re-enforce Edhem
Pasha's army. The men are jubilant over
the successes of the Turkish army and are
clamoring for orders to advance upon the
Greeks immediately.
A dispatch from Constantinople says
that it has been decided to increase the
strength of the Turkish army in its Euro
pean provinces to 300,000 men. and ac
cording to this plan Turkey will very
shortly have 500,000 men in arms, includ
ing the forces in Asia Minor.
Jha dispatch also says that four trans
port ships with troops have passed
through the Dardanelles. Their destina
tion is unknown. Heavy re-enforcements
of Turkish troops are gathering at Veles
tino for a renewed attack upon the Greek
positions there.
The Turkish losses at Velestino were
thus fur greater than at any of the pre
vious battles since the beginning.
(irrrr-'m Reply Re. erred.
LONDON, Eng., May 4.â The Chronicle's
dispatch from Athens says the diplomats
have offered to intervene between Greece
and Turkey. Greece has reserved her
reply. The dispatch adds that General
Smolenitz, commander of the right wing
ot the Greet army in Thessaly, has de
clined to accept tht position of com
mander-in-chief, preferring to remain
with a brigade. The Turks have evacu
ated Trikkala. A Greek force has been
sent to reoccupy the town. There is a
complete lull in operations.
ELEVEN PERSONS PERISH.

â  ABERDEEN, Scoteand, May 4.â Eleven
lives were lost by the sinking of the small
steamer Coliynie off here last night. She
settled soon after a collision with the
steamer Girnigol. Captain Lowrie fas
tened lifebelts around his two sons and,
clasping his wife in his arms, awaited the
inevitable sinking of the ship. The cap
tain's wife was torn from his arms by an
immense wave which closed over the ves
sel. The Girnij-ol stood by and picked up
the captain, but his family of three and
the crew of eight men were drowned. The
Girnigol was badly damaged, but suc
seeded in reaching a quay with Captain
Lowrie.

BILLS REPORTED
TO THE SENATE
Dingley's Tariff Measure
Is Submitted by
Aldrich.
Information Asked Regarding
the Work of the Venezue
lan Commission.
. ,
Gorman's Objection to the Large
Appropriations Ably Responded '
To by Senator Foraker.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 4. â The
Dingley tariff bill was reported back to
the Senate to-day by Aldrich and placed
on the calendar, to ba called up two weeks
rom to-day.
it will be followed in a few days with a
printed statement showing the character
of changes presented in the amendments
recommended by the Finance Committee.
Aldrich staled it was the intention of
the committee to present provisions in re
lation to reciprocity in place of the sec
tion in the House bill, which the commit
tee recommended struck out.
At the request of White, a memher of
the Finance Committee, Aldrich said the
report represented the action ' of the ma
jority of the committee and that the Demo
cratic members non-concur.
A resolution was offered by Allen and
agreed to requesting the President to in
form the Senate whether the special com
mission appointed to examine and report
the boundary lines between Venezuela and
British Guinea has yet reported, and if so
to transmit to the Senate a copy of the re
port; if not to state wbat progress has
been made in the investigation.
A joint resolution for the reception of
Carlos Guiterrez, son of San Salvador's
President, at West Point Academy for in
struction was introduced by Hawley. A
letter from Secretary Sherman was read,
saving the request had been made by the
Government of Salvador through the
Minister of the Greater' Republic of
Central America.
Morgan protested that no recognition of
the Greater Republic of Central America
had ever been made by the United States,
and said Congress ought to De informed
whether there was such a republic. The
resolution, however, was passed.
Allison, chairman of the Committee on
Appropriations, moved to proceed to the
consideration of the civil appropriation
bill, but was appealed to by Morgan (D. )
of Alabama not to press the motion until
2 o'clock, so as to give an opportunity for
the consideration of the joint resolution
recognizing the belligerency of Cubans.
He intimated that the delay in action on
that joint resolution was intended to give
Spain an opportunity to raise money in
the markets of Europe on her bonds,
which she would not be able to do if the
Senate passed the joint resolution.
Allen disclaimed any such purpose and
stated why he desired action on the ap- i
propriation bill, which he hoped to have
completed. The Senate then proceeded to
the consideration of the sundry civil bill.
The reading of the bill covering 139 printed
pages and appropriating about $3,000,000
was completed in two hours and a half.
The few amendments recommended by
the Committee on Appropriations were
agreed to without question. Among
them were propositions to make immedi
ately available $2,333,000 for improving
the Mississippi River and $100,000 for. the
payment of fees in the United Slates
courts.
. The bill was then' open to general
amendments. The tirst of these led to a
speech by Gorman deprecating the ex
travagant appropriations of the bill. Gor
man inveighed generally against the bill
as appropriating a larger aggregate
amount than had ever been contained in
any similar bill. The tariff bill reported
to-day proposes to add $65,000,000, or $70,-
COO.OOO taxes of the people. He thought it
would be the height of unwisdom at this
time to increase the already too large items
in the sundry civil bill.
There were items there which could af
ford to wait until at least larger taxes
were wrung from the people under the new
tariff. He had hoped an attempt would
be made to reduce the tariff bill as it came
from the House and he trusted before ii
passed the Senate it would be greatly re
duced. There should be also a great re
duction in the expenditures and he ap
pealed to the Senate to apply the pruning
knife to the sundry civil bill.
Foraker, in replying to Gorman, said
if he knew there were items in the bill
winch ought not to be, it was his duty to
point them out. As to the Republican
party Foraker declared its policy was speak
ing for itself more eloquently than any
human tongue could speak. He con
tended that it is the purpose of our legis
lation that the Government shall have
sufficient revenue to meet ordinary ex
penses, sufficient revenue to make it un
necessary to issue bonds to meet current
obligations, and sufficient revenue to pay
pensions to men entitled to them. It will
have that revenue and those obligations
will all be maintained.
After further discussion the bill went
over without action.
The Senate homestead bill, which has
been the unfinished business several days,
was taken up and passed; yeas 42, nays
11. It provides that all settlers under the
homestead laws upon public lands ac
quired prior to the passage of this act are
entitled to a patent for the land upon pay
ment to the local land officers of the cus
tomary fees.
The Senate then adjourned.
THE BLYTHE CASE.
Aitorney-Gmeral Hart His Prepared His
Brief for the United States Su
preme Court.
WASHINGTON.. D. C, May 4.-Attor
ney-General W. H. H. Hart of California
has prepared his brief to hie with the
United States Supreme Court in the Blythe
case. In moving to dismiss' the writ of
error he argues that the United States
Government has not made any treaty or
passed any law and there is no provision
in the United States constitution prohib
iting a State granting to a non-resident
alien the right to Inherit land within the
State; hence a State statute granting such
right is not in conflict with any treaty or
law of the United States nor with the
constitution of ttie United States.
He sars there is no doubt that if there
were a treaty existing between the United
Sales and. a foreign country providing
that any citizen of the fore gn country
might take in any property of the United
States by succession as heir, that such a
provision in a treaty would have the effect
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 5, 1897.
to suspend a State statute or the common
law prohibiting such citizen of the foreign
country from inheriting, and upon this
point he calls the court's attention to the
case of Hauenstein vs. Lin ham . and the
case of George Froy vs. Riggs, 133 U. S.
258-266. â¢
It is stated in the latier case (267): "The
treaty, being part of t c supreme law of
the land, controls the statute and com
mon law of Maryland wherever it differs
from it."
Ample ground for dismissing, for want
of jurisdiction, the writ of error issued in
this case appears in the decision of the
Superior Court in the proceeding under
section 1664 of the Code of Civil Procedure
of California, as well as in the decision in
said application for distribution, in both
of which decisions it was found and ad
judged, as above stated, that the plaintiffs
in error in this case were not related, nor
was either of them related to said Thomas
Blythe, deceased.
Jefferson Chandler, attorney for plain
tiffs in error, will arrive ere in a day or
two. Mr. Hart does not know whether he
will file a brief in answer .to his own
argument or whether he will move for a
continuance.
AFTER THE SPANISH MISSION.
Four We/I- Barked Candidates With In

Aldrich of Illinois. The indications are
that all of them stand an equal chance.
E ich candidate is strongly backed, and if
it comes to a matter of influence it will be
hard for the President to choose.
Behind Frank Aldrich is Speaker Reed,
while Herbert Bowen is indorsed by many
New England Congressmen, General
Horace Porter, Admiral Erber and others.
Bryan has Secretary Gage and the Illinois
Senators at hiÂ» back, while John Russell
Young has the President's personal friend
ship. Young has asked no help and is not
an applicant for the mission. It is known,
however, that he would take the place if
offered him.
The latest applicant is Bryan, and if the
infiuence of Gave prevails he will go to
Madrid. At present Bryan is a member
of the Illinois Assembly and chairman of
the Civil Service Committee. Â
Frank Aldrich, who was Reed's official
mathematician in the skirmish for the St.
Louis nomination, is an applicant for the
Spanish mission tir-t, but if it is shown
that he cannot have that he will bo con
tent with another appointment. Reed is
doing ail in bis power to help Aldrich.
Herbert W. Bowen seems to have rested
his case. About a fortnight ago it was in
timated that Bowen would get the place,
but since other candidates have appeared
he will not have smooth sailing.
JAPAN'S MINISTER TALKS.
Sees No Occasion lor Unfriendliness With
This Country on Account of
Hawaii's Action.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 4.-It is
said at the Japanese legation that advices
just received from Japan fail to indicate
that there is unusual excitement there on
account of the recent deportation of Japa
nese immigrants from Hawaii. The j
Japanese Minister to-night expressed I
regret that exaggerated rumors upon the j
subject should have apparently gained
credence here. In his opinion there is
nothing either in the attitude of his Gov
ernment or public feeling in Japan to
justify the belief that the question be
tween Japan and Hawaii cannot be settled j
by ordinary diplomatic methods. Least ;
of all, he says, is there anything in the I
incident which can possibly cause a mis
understanding between Japan and the
United States.
Japanese lmmigrati* n to Hawaii was
begun at the solicitation of the Hawaiian
Government; but now the authorities of
the republic, without notice and contrary
to precedent, so the Minister says, have
denied tbe Japanese the right to land.
The Japanese Minister has no doubt that
his Government will hold that the Ha
waiian Government has thereby violated
the conventional rights of Japanese sub
jects, and will endeavor by well-recognized
methods of diplomacy to secure some
remedy for persons whose interests have
been injured.
"Tnat is all there is of the question,"
he says, "and it leaves no room for the
pretext that Japan is about to seek re
dress in some extraordinary way. Japan
will make no remonstrance against
reasonaoie law-. She has shown this by
acquiescing in the decision of the
Hawaiian authorities regarding the
deportation of a large number of con
tract laborers who had gone to Hawaii
in violation of both Japanese and Ha
waiian law, but in other cases claims
the laws of Hawaii, in manifest refusal of
all precedents, were capriciously enforced
and for that reason she asks lor her peo
ple the redress to which the treaty of Ha
waii and the Jaw of nations entitle them.
"With this alone in view the Japanese
Government has shown no inclination to
adopt any but a reasonable and moderate j
policy. Her suspension of emigration at
the beginning of the trouble was the best
proof that could be given of her desi c not
to aggravate the situation."
The Japanese Minister says he is con
vinced that when the people of this coun
try understand fully the significance of
that action, as well as the general policy
of his Government they will sympathize
with the efforts of Japan to protect her
people instead of regarding them as inim
ical to their own interest.
SALISBURY It ECUS ha.
Will Xot Inter Into an Agreement to
Protect the Seals.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 4.â A note
has been received at the State Department
from Lord Salisbury which is said to give
his reasons for declining to enter into a
modus Vivendi for the present sealing
season in Bering Sea and to send a fleet to
maintain a patro'. John W. Foster, the
special envoy of this Government to
negotiate- and sign an agreement with
Great Britain for the better protection of
the seal herds, is preparing an answer to
Salisbury's presentation of the case.
While no positive confirmation can be se
cured, it is hinted that the British Gov
ernment baa declined to send another ex
pert commission to Bering Sea to in
vestigate the condition of the herds with
the view of determining whether some
concerted action with the United States is
necessary to prevent their extermination.

gold in the treasury was decreased neariy
$4,000,000 *â  to-day from r yesterday. It is
now under $150,000,000. The treasury offi

as at first, when they said that the drain
would be but temporary, but it is cur

anxiety in the treasury for fear that the

WILL BE A SWARM
OF ENDEAVORERS
Great Activity Among
the Members at
the Hub.
Unusually Low Rates to the
Convention to Be Held
In This City.
Many Eloquent Speakers Who Have
Promised to Be Present on
the Occasion.
BOSTON, Mass , May âGreat prepara
tions are being made by local members of
the Christian Endeavor Society toattend
the annual convention at San Francisco,
and everything points to a large at
tendance from this city. Unusually low
railroad rates bave been agreed upon, and
to many this will be the trip of a lifetime.
In Chicago yesterday a representative
of the Endeavorers conferred with Chair
man Caldwell and the the executive com
mittee of the Western Passenger Associa
tion. The new arrangements made will
permit a I Western lines to sell tickets at
the following rates â these rates for one
way, either going or returning:
From Chicago and Milwaukee to San
Francisco, $25; from St. Louis, Cairo,
Memphis and New Orleans to San Fran
cisco, $23; from Peoria and Blooraington
to San Francisco, $24; from St. Paul and
Minneapolis to San Francisco, $26 75;
from Sioux City, Columbus, Kansas,
Mineok and Houston to San Francisco,
$22 50.
Tnese unusually low rates are most
satisfactory, and there is no doubt that
thousands will be now induced to make
the journey to the convention, and at the
same time visit ail important points of i
interest in the far West and Caiiiornia.
The Eastern and Southern lines will
sell round-trip tickets up to these Western
gateways at one price for the round-trip â 
ticket. The reason the Western lines
will not sell round-trip tickets is that
they wish to protect themselves from the
ticket broker.", but as they have made the
rate each way so low it is really lower
than one fare tor the round trip.
The prospects for a grand convention
are the best. The programme is certainly !
the very best ever prepared by the United
Society of Christian Endeavor. Here are |
the names of some of the speakers who |
have already promised to be present ln
San Francisco:
Rev. J. Wilbur Chapman, D. D.. Philadel- |

PASSENGER AG EATS MEET.
Recommendations ofthe Executive Com
mute Hith Regard to Rates.
CHICAGO, 111., May 4.â general
meeting of the Western Passenger Associ
ation was held to-day to take final action
in regard to rates and arrangements for
the Christian Endeavor convention in San
Francisco next July. The executive com
mittee, which has been at work on the
matter for some time, presented a report
recommending a one-way rate of $25 from
Chicago via the Missouri River and mak
ing provision for the sale of one-way tick
ets at the -same rate, returning via the
Missouri River, and $32 50 via St. Paul.
Tbe dates recommended for the sale of
tickets at these rates were June 22, 23, 29
and 30 and July 1 and 2, with final going
limits to July 9. Dates of sale for return
one-way tickets were July 12 to 17 and 19,
22, 26 and 29 and August, 2, 5 and 9, with
final return limits not to exceed Aug
ust 15.
There is no doubt as to the adoption of
these recommendations. The executive
committee further reported that it had
secured conditional promises to become
members from the Rio Grande Western,
j Denver and Rio Grande, Great Northern
j and Northern Pacitic roads.

BOSTON, Mass , May 4â A crowd of a
thousand assembled st 10:30 o'clock this
morning in Newspaper Row to see A.
Rube, A. Rube's wife, A. Rube's doir and
A. Rube's tandem cycle begin a tour
across the country to San Francisco.
A. Rube proved to be William Vino,
better known to fame as Barnum's
Yankee, or as Willie Taylor the Jay, from
Bethel, Vt. The doe, Fritz, . occupied a
basket on the tandem. Vino wore long
hair, all his own; a luxuriant bunch of
acquired whiskers of the so-called spinach
variety under his chin and a small hatâ a
souvenir of his Barnum days. He is a
typical countryman.
Mrs. Vino is a prepossessing liitle
woman, tastefully garbed in a stylish dark
green corduroy jacket, loose bloomers,
tan legf:ins, gaiters and a green corduroy
Tarn o' Sbanter. She is an English
woman and an expert cyclist, like her hus

has attempted the journey to San Fran
ciscy on a tandem.
The route has been laid out to Wor
cester, Springfield, North Adams, Troy
and Albany, following the New York Cen
tral Railroad to Buffalo, thence through
Ohio to Chicago, etc. They expect to bo
on the road until November, and to ride
about forty miles a day, or 250 mile- a
week. A procession of several hundred;
boys and men escorted them out of town.
EDWARD THORN E DEAD.
Was the Youngest Son of a Family Once
Famous in the H story of tho
American Theater.
NEW YORK. N. V., May 4â Actor
Edward Tnorne died trom a complication
of diseases at St. Vincent's Hospital. He
was the youngest son of a family once
famous in the history of the American
theater. Until the period of their success
most of the players known here were of
; English birth. Edward Thome was born
in 1845 and in 1860 went to San Francisco
and for five years appeared there. His
father, Charles Robert Thome, was then
manager of the Metropolitan Theater
there.
Edwin Thorne was well known in San
Francisco during the days of the war.
He was a brother of Charles Thorne Jr.,
and his line was tbat of walking gentle
men, â  appearing at times in Maguire's
Opera-house, then on Washington street,
and at other times in the Metropolitan
Theater â¢on Montgomery aireet, near
Jackson. At the former he appeared with
the stock company of which Sophie
Edwin, Mrs. Betty Saunders, Frank Mayo,
Chirles Thome Jr., Lulu Sweet and
Walter Leaman were the leading mem
bers, and at the latter he appeared with
Julia Deane Hayne and Sallie Hinckley.
He was a pleasing gentleman on the stage,
but never attained a very high position in
the profession.

Frank A. Magowan, secured a divorce in
Oklahoma last summer, to-day instituted

of Magowan's conduct last week by bring

KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 4 âDefinite
steps toward the amalgamation of the
National League of Musicians and the
American Federation of Musicians will

DR. GOODMANSON
FOUND GUILTY
Sentenced to Life Im
prisonment for Wife
Murder.
General Surprise at the Ver
dict and the Prisoner
Collapses.
Peculiar Phases of the Case Lead
to Conviction on Circumstan
tial Evidence.
PONCA, Nebr., May âDr. J. Sidney
GooUmanson was to-night declared guilty
of wife-murder and sentenced to life im
prisonment. The jury deliberated but
two hours, the first ballot being unani
mous. The prisoner almost fainted when
his late was announced. The verdict was
a general surprise and an appeal will be
taken.
It is conceded that the revelations con
cerning the young woman at Kansas City,
to whom the accused was engaged while
his wife was still living, had much to do
with the conviction. Though the fact
was elicited that Goodmanson kept her
picture hung in bis wife's room and con
tinually taunted Mrs. Goodmanson with
the story of his love for the girl, the name
of the woman has never been learned.
The State sent a detective to Kansas City,
but he was unable to discover anything
about her. The picture is that of a girl
richly dressed, about 20 years of age, and
a magnificent blonde.
The theory of the State was that in
order to marry this gtrl and to get the
balance of his wife's fortune the murder
was committed. Mrs. Goodmanson died
last September in her husband's office at
Pender, Nebr. The symptoms were those
of strychnine poisoning, though the at
tending physician certified that death re
sulted from heart failure. Goodmanson
has shown great concern during the trial
forthe Kansas City girl ior fear that her
identity would be disclosed.
ALTGELD AS A WITNESS.
Makes Some Damaging Admiss ons Con
cerning H s Relations With Bank-
Wrecker Spalding.
CHICAGO, 111., May 4.â ln the investi
gation of the failure of the Globe Savings
Bank to-day ex-Governor Altgeld, whose
name has been prominently connected
with the failure, was the star witness. He
did not have any very sensational testi
mony to give, however.
He freely admitted that he had been in
favor of allowing Spalding to control the
funds of the University of Illinois, for he
had fully believed in his honesty and his
ability as a financier until the bank bad
failed. The witness said that he himself
bad been but a small borrower at the
Globe Bank.
In this statement ex-Governor Altgeld
directly contradicted the evidence given
several days ago b\* ex-State Bank Exam
iner Robertson. The latter said that .he
had found' the books to be in a condition
that warranted its being closed late in
1892. He did not make any recommenda
tion in the matter, however, as he went
out of office a few weeks later, when Alt
geld became Governor. He said that Alt
geld and nis brother-in-law, Lanehart,
and their associates were heavy borrowers

RATES ARE
CUT DOWN
But the New Tariff Bill
Will Increase the
Revenues.
MEANS SIXTY MILLIONS
MORE INCOME.
Reciprocity With Hawaii Is
Knocked Out by the
Senators.
PEARL HARBOB CONSIDERED
TOO HIGH A PRICE.
Greater Tax Must Be Paid on Beer
and Tobaccoâ One Thousand
Amendments Made.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 4.â a
special meeting of the Finance Committee
this morning the Dingley bill, which
passed the House March 31, was reported
from the sub-committee composed of Alli
son, Aldrich, Piatt (Conn.) and Wolcott,
who had been working upon it almost
constantly since.
Last night it was not thought possible
the bill could be reported to-day, but the
decision of Jones of Nevada to vote with
the Republicans made it easy sailing, and
before the committee adjourned it was
decided to report to the Senate immedi
ately. This was done, and notice was
given that it would be called up lor con
sideration on May 18. The Democrats
will in the meantime carefully examine
the bill, In the opinion of those having
experience with previous tariff bills it is
one that cannot pass both houses and
through the conference committee in less
than two months after being presented to
the Senate, and possibly will not became
law before August. July is stated in the
bill as the time when it shall take effect,
but this date was selected merely as a
matter of convenience and is subject to
change. The revised bill was more lib
erally amended than any tariff measure
before Congress in many years, and a
casual inspection shows that the amend
ments number in the neighborhood of a
thousand, or two to three hundred more
than was added to the celebrated Wilson
bill by the Senate committee.
As a general thing the bill shows a
decided reduction in the Dingley rates.
The jates on lumber and lumber products
are left at the high rates fixed by the
House. The contention of Senator Jones
for a duty on hides and lead ere of iy_
cents per pound, and a like increase in the
fruit schedule, was adopted. It is under
stood the Republicans have informally j
agreed not to offer any amendments in
the Senate as individuals, but to submit
all to the Finance Committee. Under this
procedure Senator Jones has been enabled
to maintain an influence over the com
mittee, as his vote is necessary to keep the
Republicans in control.
In the opinion of Aldrich, the bill as re
vised will increase the revenue about $60,
--00,000; $30,000,000 from the tariff, $30,000,
--000 from internal revenue.
At 10:30 o'clock* to-morrow morning the
Republicans will hold a caucus ostensibly
for the purpose oi effecting a reorganiza
tion of committees, but it is likely that
some party policy in regard to the con
sideration of the tariff bill in the Senate
will be discussed.
In the bill as reported, the retroactive
clause making all rates collectible April
1, 1897, is stricken out. The Senate com
mittee believes the retroactive feature un
constitutional. Another important pro
vision stricken from the bill is the recip
rocity feature. It is understood the policy
of reciprocity has not been entirely aban
doned by the Republican Senators, but 1
will be a subject of discussion in the
Senate.
The provision of the Dingley bill with
regard to the Hawaiian treaty reads:
"Provided, that nothing herein con
tained be so construed as abrogating or in
any manner to impair or affect the pro
visions of the treaty of commercial re
ciprocity concluded between the United
States and the Queen of the Hawaiian
slands January 30, 1875, or the provisions
of any act of Congress heretofore passed
for the execution of the same."
This provision was stricken entirely
from the bill and nothing put in its place.
* As one member of the Finance Commit
tee expressed it, all the United States was
getting in return for this concession to
. the sugar interests of Hawaii was the
privilege of occupying Pearl harbor and
this price was regarded altogether too
high.
One radical surprise in th*** bill was tho
provision prosing a duty of 10 cents a
pound on tea. This duty is continued
until January, 1900, when tea is to go upon
the free list. Works of art, scientific
books and wearing apparel are placed
upon the free list with the general excep
tion of works of art used for the purpose
of utility and clothing used strictly for
alornmer.t. Tbese will be dutiable.
The majority of the committee, however,
are understood to be opposed to the gen
eral policy of tariff reciprocity. A new
and most important provision makes it a
part of the Republican policy to increase
the duties on various schedules in accord
â¢ ance witb the bounty paid by countries
from which articles are exported.
The sugar schedule is so complicated
that no Senator on the Finance Commit
tee was found willing to express an opin
ion on its exact meaning or effect. An
official of the Senate who had several
years' experience in framing tariff bills
said the' technical construction cf the
schedule would afford a differential duty
to sugar-refiners of about % of a cent a
pound. According to the new schedule
â¢ sugars not above No. 16 Dutch standard,
testing by the polariscope above 87 and
not above 88 degrees, will pay a duty of
.79 of a cent per pound, and for every ad
ditional degree shown by the polariscopic
test .02 of a cent per pound and fractions
" of degrees in proportion; sugar above No.
16 Dutch standard and refined 1 1-16 cents
per pound and an addition thereto on all
the foregoing 35 per cent ad valorem ; su
gars not above No. 16 Dutch standard and
showing not more than 87 degrees polari
scopic test 75 per cent ad valorem.
Another unexpected provision in the bill
was the 44 cents tax on beer in addition to
the $1 now levied, which it is estimated
by the committee will increase the reve
nue fifteen millions a year. .
The wool schedule shows 2 and 3 cents a \
pound on finer grades of the raw product,
but a slight increase on rates on carpet
wools. It was also decided to increase the
tobacco schedules, but with regard to cot
ton and metals the changes from the Wil
son bill are slight, although considerably
lower than the proposed Dingley rates.
An exception to this rule was found in the
rates on cutlery, which are nearly as high
as fixed by the bill as it passed the House.

CORWIN E'S EMBEZZLEMENT.
In the Confession ot ihe Naval Paymas
ter He Pleads He Was Rubbed
by a Clerk.
NEWPORT, R. 1., May 4 âThe confes
sion of Naval Paymaster Corwine, charged
with embezzlement and desertion, was
read to the courtmartial this morning,
after which the court sent a secret verdict
to Washington. Corwine said while on
the Nipsic in 1888 his clerk, whom he
trusted implicitly, robbed him, hut kept
the accounts so cleveriy the defalcation
was not di covered till the end of the
cruise. He had two alternatives, the hon
orable one of reporting the matter, which
would show him to have been a careless
official, or to replace the money. He
chose the latter and his bondsmen made
good the deficit. ' '
The bondsmen soon began to threaten j
him and he was obliged to take the
Government's money to repay them.
After borrowing from friends and others
to keep the accounts with the Govern
ment apparently straight for a time he
found it impossible to regain lost ground
and so embezzled $5000 more and fled.
With this statement he resigned the case.
Letters were read showing his previous
good conduct. One from Commander
Lyon testified to Corwine's bravery in the
great Samoan storm.

THE SOUTH POLE
Well-Equipped Expedi
tion to Start From
Australia.
Provincial Governments Ex
tend Aid to Explorer
Borchgrevink.
The Swedish Navigator Confident
That He Can Penetrate to
the Polar Sea.
VANCOUVER, B. C, May 4.âAus
tralia, by virtue of her position in the
Southern ocean, naturally looks to the
antaictic as the field of scientific explora
tion and research. Interest in the icy soutb
is revived by C. E. Borchgrevink, who has
been to the lands about which he writes
and would again venture to their inhospit
able shores. In his appeal to the Austra
lian Governments Mr. Borchgrevink briefly
recounts the history of antarctic explora
tion and deals generally with some of the
scientific and commercial results that are
likely to follow further investigation by a
well-equipped expedition to South Vic
toria Land. He submits to the Govern
ments a map of the Antarctic showing the
route taken by fair James Clark Ross with
other drawings. /
Australia is deeply interested in the
Swedish navigator's assertion that he will
be able to find the south magnetic pole
that Sir James Clark Ross, the discoverer
of Victoria Land, failed to find in 1841. The
steamship Warnmoo to-day brings the
news that the Colonial Governments and
scientific men will take up Borchgrevint's
proposal and place him at the head of a
well-equipped expedition. The Antarctic
navigator says in proof that his theory is
tenable.
"I noticed a very low barometric
pressure within the antarctic circle, such
as has also been observed in the same
latitude within the arctic circle. This
low barometric indication was not a fore
cast of rough weather, and even with an
indication of 29 we had constantly fine
weather within the antarctic circle. I be
lieve that this low pressure is in a great
measure due to the rotation of the globe
and thus to the law of gravitation. While
the globe we live upon was still a glowing
mass the matter was thrown, toward the
equator or toward the periphery ot the
rotation and therefore the globe is flat
tened toward the ends of its axis of rota
tion. Now, I believe that air naturally
follows the same law as does the rest of
the globe hence the lower barometric
pressure toward the poles rather than
toward the equator.
"It has been contended against my
theory that it cannot hold good, as it does
not act everywhere within the arctic
circle. I reply that rather than taking
exceptional conditions in the arctic as a
standard we ought to prove why the cen
trifugal power does not act everywhere in
the north." * â¢â¢**
WRECKS IN SOUTHERN SEAS.
Fire A/most Destroys the Steamship
Bothweil Castleâ Loss of the Myrtle
and Burdikin.
VANCOUVER, B. C, May 4. âThe
steamship Warrimoo from Australia re
ports that the steamship Bothweil Castle
took fire 600 miles from the port of Ade
laide. The hatches were opened and
water poured down, but to no avail. The
hatches were battened down and water
and steam pumped into the hold. Three
hundred passengers were driven from
their cabins and crowded in the fore part
of the steamship like panicky sheep.
For three days no headway could be
made against the flames, and eighty
women and sixty children, expecting
every minute to be lost, were accompany
ing the crew's tireless and never-ceasing ef
forts by prayers and lamentations. Flames
were finally got under control and the big
steamship was towed into porta mere
shell. Not a single life was lost.
The schooner Myrtle, which was
wrecked, on Barrier Reef, off Lizard
Island, is a total loss. The Myrtle was
running to British Guinea, heavily freight
ed. Her Majesty's ship Ring-don sighted
the wreck and signaled the steamer far
rago, which proceeded to the wreck and
rescued the passengers and crew, includ
ing Captain Inman. Mr. Tenbury and an
able seaman named Patterson refused to
leave the wreck, though the sea was run
ning mountains high and the craft was
going to pieces. A boat was left for their
use, but it is not known whether they es
caped.
The steamer Burdikin isa total wreck
on a reef sixteen miles southwest of
Woodlark Island. The schooner Canonic
resc.ied all on board. When the vessel
struck the passengers and . crew took to
boats and reached one of the Alcester
group of islands. After much privation
they were picked up by a passing schooner.
The Burdikin had, besides heavy freight,
a cargo of gold. Insurance companies
lose heavily Dy the wreck.
SOLOMON ISLAM) WARS.
Tribal Conflicts Tfrcimating the Banks of
thr tierce Natives.
VANCOUVER, B. C, May 4.â The bar
kentine Chiltoor, arriving at Melbourne
from a trading voyage through the Solo,
mon group before the departure of the
Warrimoo, which reached Vancouver to
day, reported that tribal wars were raging
on* the island when it left. Foreign set
tlers feared thero would be a general out
break. The wars were spreading to many
ofthe islands, and just before the schooner
left Captain Keating beard that a large
war party had started out on a mission of
revenge, rapine and murder.
The trouble arose over the murler of
two native women and all the islands arc
aroused. Natives are well armed and itis
feared that there will be great bloodshed,
Â»nd that the awful head-hunting excur
sions will commence again, when thou
sands of braves will scour the country. to
bring back human heads as trophies. It
is thought that war vessels are now on
their way to the islands.
MONTEREY'S SOLDIER BOYS.
Members of the O.d Capital Guard Armed
With flis Used in the Mexican
War.
MONTEREY, Cal., May 4.â Since the
days when Uncle Sam's guardians lived
in barracks here and kept watch .over the
turbulent citizens of the newly ac
quired Territory there has never been a
regularly organized military company of
any kind until the present' time. For the
past few years there has been much desul
tory talk of forming a militia company in
the old Spanish capital and several unsuc
cessful attempts have been made, but re
cently the movement resulted in some
thing substantial.
An organization; was finally perfected
as an independent cadet company â not as
a part of 'the State militia, as was at first
contemplatedâ under the name of the
Old Capital Cadets and the members were
equipped from their own private purses.
A notable feature of their equipment is
the arms which they use in the manual.
These pieces are flintlocks and *muzz'e
loading â¢ rifles, whicn have been handed
down from sire to son since the time of
the padres, the more modern of them all
being veterans of the Mexican war. These
guns are highly piizod by all Monterey
anos and the iact of their being used by
the boys of the new company inspires a
feeling of interest and respect by the
young men. The ancient-pattern of these
pieces, however, makes them difficult to
use according to the new army tactic* and
it is likely that they will of necessity be
abandoned for drill purposes and brought
out only to do honor to special occasions.
A retired officer of the United States
army is acting as drillmaster and as the
cadets are otherwise weli officered they
bid fair to enjoy a long and prosperous
career and hope to become the nucleus of
a regiment that will he as famous as the
celebrated New York Seventh.
HELD AT PORT TOWNSEND.
Landing Refused Several Hundred Coolies
En Route to the Nashville
Exposition.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., May 4 â
The steamer Kingston this morning on its
regular trip from Victoria to Port Town
send called at Diamond Point to take
aboard the Chinese who have been there
for some time in quarantine because they
had been aboard of the smallpox-infected
steamship Victoria, which arrived two
weeks ago from the Orient. . They had
had been mustered by Dr. Stimson, United
States officer in charge of the station, and
none were found missing. Accordingly
they were formed into singlo file, and 330
Chinese went aboard tbe Kingston, fol
lowed by 24 Japanese. These are sup
posed to be actors bound for the exposi
tion at Nashville, Term.
Some months ago the promoters of this
exposition procured permission from the
Treasury Department to bring into the
country a number of Chinese to illustrate
their manners and customs in their
Oriental home. No particular significance
was attached to the movement until 200
coolies had been permitted to enter. Then
it dawned upon the officials of the Treasury
Depanm?nt that they were being imposed
upon, and the result was that an order was
issued limiting the number who could still
claim the privilege of com into the land
of the Stars and Stripes. Unfortunately
for the Orientals which went through here
to-day, this order went into effect while
they were en route. They arrived to learn
that there was a great possibility that the
majority, if not all of them, would be sent
back at once. ;,* >:. â 
While the matter was under advise
ment Dr. Stimson, learning that smallpox
had afllieted two of the crew of the vessel
while in the Orient and that the Victoria
had not undergone the fumigation re
quired by the quarantine laws of this
country, ordered the entire crowd into
quarantine. This was a great relief to the
customs officials, as it afforded a plausible
excuse for detaining the Celestials until
the case could be thoroughly investigated.
The result of this investigation has been
to limit the entiie number to be admitted
to 250, and as already 179 have gained en
trance, only a small number .of those
aboard the Kingston will be landed.
On arriving at Tacoma, the entire party
will bi tran-ferred to the steamer Sehome,
now in the "ooneyard" there, to be held
until the customs authorities get through
with them. Seventy-one Will, be passed,
and the remaining 259 must go back to
China by the next steamer. "'. >"â 
SAN JOSE LINEMAN'S SUIT.
Edward Salt z man Brings Action for
Heavy Damages Because Shocked
by a Live Wire.
SAN JOSE. Cal., May 4.â The trial of
the $51,000 damage suit of Edward Salt z
man against the Sunset Telephone and
Telegraph , Company and the San Jose
Railroad Company began before a jury in
Judge Kittredge's court this morning.
The claim . is i based on injuries received
while the plaintiff was employed as line
man by the telephone company.
On May 15, 1896, Saltzman was engaged
in adjusting wires on a pole at the cor
ner of First and San Fernando streets.
While climbing the pole, about twenty
five feet from tbe ground, the lineman I
came in contact with a guide wire from j
the overhead wire of the electric railway
and received a shock that threw him to |
tbe ground. The man struck on the pave- j
ment and both his kneecaps were broken.
He was also bruised about the bead and
received a concussion of tbe brain and
spinal column. He was confined to his j
bed for eleven weeks, and it is alleged he I
will never fully recover his health. Dam
ages in the sum of $50,000 and $1000 - for
medical attendance are asked for.
It is . alleged that the accident resulted
through the negligence of the defendant
corporations to have the guide wires from
the electric road and attachments properly
insulated.
The morning was occupied in securing
a jury. This afternoon a couple of wit
nesses were examined.

UKIAH WOMAN
FIGHTS A RIVAL
Exciting Combat on the
lJ Main Street of
Hopland.
Business Man's Wife Hears
Rumors That Precipitate
Hostilities.
The Pretty Object of Her Wrath
Meets the Attack With a
Stubborn Defense.
UKIAH, Cal., May News of a sensa
tional street tight at Hopland between
two women well known in this part of
Mendocino County has set the gossips'
tongues to wagging at a rapid rate. The
principals were Mrs. Lou Abrahams and
Miss Hose Varner, and both bear striking
evidences of the fray.
Mrs. Abrahams' husband, Louis, owns a
goneral merchandise store at Hopland,
while Mr?. Abrahams lives with relatives in
this city. In Abrahams' employ is a young
man named Varner, whose handsome sis
ter was a frequent caller at the store.
Somehow â probably with no good reason â
rumors began to fly about that the store
keeper was getting very fond of his clerk's
sister, and the gossip finally reached Mrs.
Abrahams. At first she paid no attention
to it, but finally, when the reports were re
peated, she decided to investigate and
boarded a train for Hopland.
She went to tho home of Miss Varner's
brother, and was met in front of the house
by the young lady herself. Those who
saw tha collision say that the sudden
meeting of a couple of heavily laden
freightcars would have been gentle in
comparison. What was said by the two
only they know, for there was no one
within earshot, but the words must have
been of a particularly belligerent nature,
for in a few seconds they were banging
each other about in true pugilistic fashion.
Mrs. Abrahams landed a stinging right
on Miss Varner's eye, nearly closing that
organ, and was repaid with a swing on the
mouth that caused her to expectorate one
or more teeth. Then the action became
heated, and it would have taxed the eye
of a sporting reporter to tally the blows
that were given and received. There
seemed to be no thougnt of body fighting
in the minds of the combatants, and they
devoted their entire energies to spoiling
each other's â and with marked suc
cess.
No one tried to interfere until Constable
Eugene Parr hove into sight and he had
great difficulty in separating the enraged
women. Both were exhausted from their
efforts and much the worse for wear.
When Abrahams heard of the melee he
at once took charge of his wife and escorted
her back to Ukiah, while Miss Varner
went; home to repair damages. Neither
Miss Varner nor Abrahams is willing to
discuss the matter, except to state that
there was absolutely nothing Âon which
the troublesome rumors could be based.
Miss Varner says she had a right to
visit her brother if she wished and that
she would not take abuse from any womau
as long as she was behaving herself as a
lady.
In an interview with The Call corre
spondent this evening Mrs. Abrahams
said that Miss Varner had for some time
been a domestic in their employ while
they lived at Healdsburg. On three sepa
rate occasions it became necessary, be
cause of the actions of the young lady, to
order her to leave the house. Each time
she returned and promised to conduct
herself better in the future.
A short time ago Abrahams and his
family left Healdsourg, his wife and fam
ily coming to Ukiah, while he opened a
general merchandise-store at Hopland.
After establishing himself in business
at that place Abrahams sent for the
brotherof the young lady and employed
him as a clerk in the. store. Varner
i brought with him his sister and his wiie.
On Friday last, so Mrs. Abrahams
I states, she received a postal card from her
! husband stating that he was ill. She left
I the followiug afternoon for Hopland, and
| on her arrival there visited her husband
lat his rooms. In the meantime her sus
j picions as to Miss Varner became very
j pronounced and she paid a visit to the
home of Varner, with whom Abrahams
boarded. She states that she was un
aware that Miss Varner was tbere.
On reaching the Varner bouse Mrs.
Abrahams met Mrs. Varner. Mrs. Abra
hams requested that she advise her sister
in-law to cease her attentions to Abra
hams. No sooner had she said this than
the young lady emerged from the house,
dashed at her and began raining blows
upon her face, scratching her and otherwise
disfiguring her. Mrs. Abrahams says she
was helpless, and it was only after she had
been considerably bruised that bystanders
could separate the women.
Mrs. Abrahams claims that Miss Varner
has for years followed her husband about
from place to place, causing her great
mental worry, and that her mission to the
house before sho was attacked was a per
fectly peaceable one. She simply intended
to discuss the matter with the young
lady's sister-in-law, and she was not the
aggressor in the combat. .
Much sympathy is expressed here for
Mrs. Abrahams, who has borne an excel
lent reputation during her residence here
and has always been prominent in social
circles. _^^___^â¢_â¢^

Outlaw aiolina Convicted of the Killing
of Juan Parra.
FRESNO, Cal., May 4.â Ramon Molina
was convicted of voluntary manslaughter
by the jury in Judge Webb's court to
day, where his trial has been in progress
for the past two days. He killed another
Mexican, Juan Parra, on Cantua Creek
in 1892. . : .....
The report in this morning's Call that
the defendant had been a member of
Vasquez's gang of outlaws in the early
days of California is borne out by the
scars of wounds which cover the man's
body. He bears a numberof marks on his
face, souvenirs ot fierce and bloody fights.
One ugly scar extends across the left ear
and across the cheek to the nose. On his
hands are seams caused by knife wounds.
If Molina would recount his experiences
in becoming so thoroughly battle-scarred
he could tell of many a ;â â¢ vicious fight.
The Deputy Sheriff! have examined the
prisoner's body, and . found it covered
with scars. â â¢ â  â¢'. j- -

TO THEIR YOUNG
Able Discussion in the
Woman's Parliament
at Ventura.
Caroline Severance of Boston
Addresses Southern Cali
fornia Mothers.
In Able Papers Wives and Daugh- I
ters Treat of Affairs of
the Home.
VENTURA, Cal., May 4.â The thir
teenth session of the Woman's Parliament i
of Southern California began in the Yen- i
tura M. E. Church at 2 o'clock this after
noon. Thirty-five women's societies were
.represented by as many delegates, and a
large numbers of visitors were present.
The meetings of the parliament are al
ways well attended and the attention they
attract to woman's work is widespread.
This is the first session of the parliament
held in Ventura, and the ladies of the ;
local organizations worked hard to make
the meeting a success. So well did they !
succeed that at the close of thÂ« first day's i
proceedings delegates who have attended
the lormer parliaments say this is one of i
the very best ever held.
Mrs. C. M. Severance of Boston, who is J
credited with the organization of the first
woman's club in this country, and her i
daughter, Mrs. Pierre C. Severance of the j
same city, were among the noted guests
present.
The meeting was called to order by the
president of the parliament. Mrs. Kate
Tupper (Jalpin of Los Angeles. The dele- !
gates representing the various organiza- !
tions presented their credentials and their j
names were placed upon the roll.
The opening paper of the session was
read by Mrs. P. C. Severance, upon "Duty j
of Parents." A spirited discussion was i
led by Mrs. C. M. Severance, and partici- â 
pated in by a number of ladies.
"Reading for Young Peopie" was the j
subject of a succeeding paper hy Mrs. R. '
H. F. Variel of Los Angeles. The dis- i
cussion which followed, led by Mrs. I
Laura H. Fay of Los Angeles, developed i
quite a difference of opinion among the \
delegates as to the kind of books that :
should be placed in the hands of the \
young.
The evenine session opened at o'clock,
the large church being crowded to the |
doors. The time was taken up with two
addresses, the first upon "Causes and
Prevention of Diseases," by Dr. Louise M. !
Harvey of the University of Southern '
California. "Mothers and Daughters" was !
the subject of an address by Mrs. E. M. Lud
lum of San Diego. Both ladles showed '
themselves t orouirh masters of the sub- !
ject sthey discussed, and the laree audience !
evidenced its appreciation in a hearty
manner.
MILL VALLEY'S COUNTRY CLUB.
Meeting Called for the Purpose of Dis
banding Because of Lack of
In ie rest.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., Ma*/ 4â The
Mill Valley Country Club, which was or
ganized two year;- ago, will after to-mor
row become a thing of the past. In the
club, which was . organized for athletic
purposes, are many prominent citizens,
not only of Mill Valley but of San Fran
cisco as well.
Secretary Thomas Fjttrell has sent a
letter to the members of the club calling
their attention to the fact that the annual
meeting will take place to-morrow night,
and that it will be especially important,
as the directors intend "to disband the
club.
The cause of the downfall of the organi
zation is easily seen. When two years
ago it was started everything pointed to
its success. The ctlicers for the tirst year
were: Lovell White, nresident; Arthur A. j
Martin, vice-president; and Frank W. j
Marvin, second vice-president; while the
other officers were fully as prominent. A
lease was obtained irom the Tamalpais j
Land and Water Company for a large j
tract of land near Millwood and a cricket j
field, baseball diamond and shooting j
range were built.
At the second annual election A. A.
Martin was elected president and the
great "Night in Mill Valley" entertain
ment ftas given. After this, which was a
great success, the members lost interest in
the organization and failed to pay their
flues. The shooting range was deserted
and stock was allowed to graz? on the
club's ground-. Financially the .organi
zation is in good condition, having a sur
plus of about $300 in the treasury. An
effort will be made to have these funds
transferred to the Mill Valley Improve
ment Club in order to complete the lay
ing of sidewalks on the roads in Mill Val

PHfENIX PRISONER IN LUCK.
Confesses ihe The It of a Violin, but Is
Discharged and Given Finan
cial Aid.
PHCENIX, Ariz , May 4.â A most un
usual scene was enac.ed in the Police
Court here yesterday, wherein the de
fendant, although confessing guilt, was
discharged and presented with a purse
made-up by Judge, jury, attorneys on
both sides and the prosecuting witness.
â¢He was Professor Alexander Segal], a
Russian Hebrew of fine education and
remarkable skill as a violinist, Segall
was arrested .at Tucson on a warrant
charging the embezzlement of a costly j
. Stainer-model violin from E. S. Hershey,.
a wealthy violin collector of this city.
The violin was borrowed with the osten
sible purpose of selling it for Mr. Hershey,
who had a duplicate of tbis model.
Professor Segall testified that the pos- i
session of the violin meant a living for '
him. He told a pitiful tale of his poverty
and illness, and how by playing the violin
on the street in his wanderings he was
always sure of a. bed and enough to eat.
At Tucson, a distance of eighty miles
from Phoenix, that he had covered through
the kindness of some Mexicans who gave
him a ride in their wagon, he attracted
attention oy his playing, and several well
to-do people had engaged him Jto teach
them the art. '
When (he professor had finished his
story there was not a dry eye in the court
room, and the prosecuting witness was the
first to start the subscription by donating

suit, andÂ« then Mr. Hershey took the de
fendant home with bim.
ARIZONA'S DKEECriTE LAW.
Eight Murderers Now in Prison May
Cscape the Death Penalty.
PHCENIX, Ariz, May' 4.â By. the neg
lect or the last Legislature to- enact a
saving clause in the new law defining the
degrees of murder eight murderers new
awaiting trial in this Territory will prob
ably escape the death penalty. This fact,
has just become apparent in the trial of
Augustine Chacon, at Solomonviile, be
tore District Judge Rouse. Chacon's
crime was committed just before the pass
age of the new law.
The new law repealed the old law, but
â - - * â  â¢.***â  -i
failed to provide for the cases then pend
ing, and now the best lawyers in the Ter
ritory cannot agree as to whether Cliacon
and the other seven murderers can be
convicted of murder in the second degree
or only of manslaughter. The last Legis
lature prided itself on tbe fact that none
of its members were practicing lawyers,
and the author of the new murder law
was a Prescott cattleman.
DROWNED IN NORTH EEL RIVER.
Father J ram of Eden Valley Colony Per
ishes in an Attempt to Ford
the Stream.
CAHTO, Cal . May 4.â A messenger ai
riving to-night brought news of the
drowning of Father Jeram, the colonizer
of Eden Valley, in North Eel River to-day.
Father Jeram left the Eden Valley Colony
at daylight, accompanied by Thomas
Chase, intending to go to Covelo on busi
ness relative to the colony. Both men
were mounted on horses, and, upon ar
riving at the river, seven miles from their
destination, they attempted to ford it.
Chase was positive that the river was
fordable, while Father Jeram was fearful ;
that it was not. Chase took the lead and
reached tho opposite shore safely." Father
Jeram followed. When in the middle of
the stream only his horse's head was above
water. The current seemed to lift Father
Jeram out of the saddle, or possibly he at
tempted to swim beside his horse. He
clung to the reins and was rapidly near
ing shore when he grasped a clump of
willows that bordered the river and re
leased his hold upon the reins.
The willows were evidently not strong
enough to sustain his weight, as he al
most instantly lelinquished his grasp and
bravely swam for shore. Ho was succeed
ing admirably for some distance, but sud
denly he sank as though paralyzed by a
cramp.
Chase! had come back into the river to
render assistance, and was within a few
feet of the drowning man when he sank',
never appearing afterward. The body had
not been recovered at 3 o'clock this after
noon. Searcning parties from the vicin
ity are dragging the river bottom.
Father Jeram was about 50 years of age,
a native of Pennsylvania, and the princi
pal colonizer of some 500 colonies wno are
engaged in farming at their site of 10,000
acres in Eden Valley. The settlers came
from Pennsylvania and Ohio two years
ago, taking up this land. Jeram divided
it into tracts to suit the finances of each
colonist. The condition of the colony has
not been regarded as flourishing of late,
owing to the land proving not over fertile.

LIVES LOST AT GREENWOOD.
Three of the Steamship Whitesboro's Crew
Drowned Near the Vessel's
Wharf.
CAHTO,' Cal.. May 4â Meager details
of the drowning of three of the crew of
the steamer Whitesboro yesterday at
Greenwood reached here to-night. The
Whitesboro plies between San Francisco
and Greenwood. While moored at the
latter place loading at its wharf the sea
and the bay became suddenly choppy and
the captain instructed the second officer
to sever the lines quickly, intending to go
out to sea to be out o; danger from the
reefs. Three men were ordered into the
boats and while attempting to cut the
lines from the anchorage a wave of great
proportions swamped the boat, turning
it completely' over. The three men â the
second officer and two of the crewâ were
lost sight ot and were seen no more.
The immense waves, sweeping and beat
ing over the steamer, rendered it hazard
ous to undertake to release the lines.
Finally after much difficulty this was ac
accomphshed and the steamer put to sea,
battling her way against the heavy break
ers, to keep from going to pieces on the
numerous reefs. " ,'
The disaster was witnessed by hundreds
on shore, who declare that the immense
breaker lhat capsized the boat was noth- j
ing sh rt of a tidal wave. The steamer
still stands far out at sea, and if weather
conditions are favorable it will return to I
the harbor to-morrow, when the names of
the drowned can be ascertained. The i
body of one of the seaman was washed i
ashore to-day.

SANTA ROSA. Cal., May 4.â Superior
Judge Mannon of Mendocino County, sit
ting on the bench of this county, to-day
removed o***e of the most famous of the
'â¢water works cases" from the calendar,
by sustaining a motion to strike out a sec
ond amended complaint nnd denying
leave to amend. The title of the case was
"The Santa Rosa Water Works vs. the
City of Santa Ro'Â»," and it has bobbed
up at regular intervals ever since the mu
nicipal water works were constructed.
There has been litigation upon litigation
over this subject until the average citizen
was bewildered by a maze of legal wran
gling and the numerous suits in equity,
actions ut law and injunctions, under
dozens of different titles, were all called
"water works case by the lay public.
One by one tbese questions have been
decided in favor of t&e city by different
courts in this and other counties until the
end seems near and victory for the mu
nicipal system appears certain.

BANDIT HI MAN SHOT NEAR YUMA.
The Desperado Resists Arrest and Re
ceives a Wound Wh eh He May
Not Survive.
YUMA, Ariz, May 4.â Robert Hinman,
alias Allen, alias Hanks, was shot and
perhaps fatally wounded by Officer James
Maxey yesterday, while resisting arrest.
Hinman, who is wanted in Roseburg,
Or., for burglary and attempting to kill
an officer who tried to place him under
arrest, is a desperate man. When a war
rant for him arrived here several days
ago, Sheriff Greenleaf found him fourteen
miles south of Yuma, employed by the
American Canal Company. The desperado
was entirely unconscious that his where-;
abouts was known, and the officer ex
perienced no difficulty in arresting him.
At an opportune moment, however, he
made a dash for liberty and escaped by
jumping into a deep, muddy laguna, over
hung by willow trees, across wbich he
swam and plunged into the woods beyond.
He was followed by bullets from the
Sheriffs revolver, none of which struck
i their mark.
A search was begun and after three
days it was successful. Hinman, when
found again, resisted arrest and sprang,
knife in hand, at Greenleaf and two of
j his men. A hard struggle ensued, and
â¢ the outlaw had almost succeed in wrest-
I ing a revolver from one <of the officers
i when he was shot by Maxey.
The ball shattered Hinman'sleg and he
] was brought to town in a very serious
condition. The limb will be amputated
| in an attempt to save Lis life.
Hinman is not over 25 years of age, but
< has a recoid as a bad man in Oregon and
California. He is a fugitive from Angels
Camp, Cal., where ' he had a running
street fight with officers and seriously
wounded one of them.

Krier announced that he wished to be paid
off and sever his connection with his em

LATHROP MAN'S INVENTION.
Produces a Smokeless Powder Possessing
Greater. Force Than Any Nm
. in Use.
STOCKTON, Cal., May âTests of an
explosive invented by a young man living
near Lathrop, this county, were made
this afternoon. For several years George
C. Milier has been experimenting with
powders, and he has at last succeeded in
producing one that is almost smokeless
and that at the same time has a greater
force than any of the ordinary powders
used. This afternoon he demonstrated
the great force of the powder that he has
invented before a committee that was ap
pointed to test it.
Taking a 32-caliber Winchester, he shot
from various distances through blocks of
redwood a foot thick, using first cartridges
loaded with tne powder. of his make and
then the regular- Winchester cartridges.
In every instance the penetration was
severul hundred percent greater with the
newer powder than with the others.
Miller claims for his new powder that it
will carry lor seven miles and kill at that
distance. No distance tests were made
to-day, but the otbers were so highly
satisfactory to the committee that they
did not hesitate to declare tbat the young
inventor has something that will revo
lutionize modern warfare, and also
cheapen the cost of gun powder. He will
not divulge the secret of his discovery, as
be has not yet applied, for a patent. He
has demonstrated on the level plain? near
Lathrop that the powder will carry an
ordinary bullet seven miles.
He has also a smokeless powder which
will also be tried next Sunday afternoon
here, when another test will be made of
the new explosive for the benefit of a
number of those who deal in powder.

LECTURES AT STANFORD
''Heredity" the tubjtct of a Discourse
by Mrs. Helen Gardener.
PALO ALTO, Cal., May 4 âMrs. Helen
Gardener delivered a lecture in the chapel
this evening before a large audience. It
was supplementary to the one recently
delivered in San Francisco. Dr. Jordan
introduced the speaker, who in substance
spoke as follows: , - .;
lt has been well said by Herbert Spencer
and more recently Dy Professor Osborn, the
able biologist of Columbia College, that the
question involved in the discussion of
heredity is not a temporary issue and that
its solution will affect all future thought.
Whether or not acquired character is trans
mitted to children ib the most important ques
tion that conironiK the human race, for it is
upon the character of the race that depends
: and will depend the condition of the race.
No school of scientists questions the fact of
heredity, but there is a warm and greatly
misunderstood contest over the exact method
used by nature in the transmission. It does
not matter whether druukeuness, for ex
ample, is transmitted to your child directly
as plain drunkenness, or whether it descends
to him as a merely weakened and undermined
"germplasm" which will lead to inebrity, lu
sanity, imbecility or what not. The soceologi
cal aspect of the question belongs to the
laboratory. â¢ There are hundreds of ca*-es
which come under the eye of the specialist
where there is no escape irom the proof that
children are born with the taint of an "ac
quired character" from which they cannot
tree themselves. "Jyp
Mrs. Gardener then discussed in a com
prehensive way heiedity as affected by
environment.
â¢'Although the kind of fruit is deter
mined at birth if I may be permitted the
form of speechâ very much of the quality
will depend upon the conditions under
! which it grewâ the environment," she
concluded. -JJJrJ-

MEDICAL CO CRT- MARTIAL.
Southern Physicians Charged With
Breach of Professional Etiquette.
ATLANTA, Ga., May 4.â Thirteen of
the Dest-known doctors in the South were
put on trial here by fellow- physicians for
permitting their pictures and interviews
to be â¢ printed â¢in the newspapers. A
breach of professional etiauette is charged.
A strong fight will be made by tne pro
fessional enemies of the accused men to
expel them from the medical association.
It is believed, however, by the conserva
tive and better class of physicians that
the charges will come to naught. The
thirteen doctors are all popular men and
have many friends. They say that the
charges were prompted Â£7 malice and
professional jealousy. They state that the
other doctors were maa because they aid
not get the amount of business which the
otbers were able to get through the adver

A WHITE LIVER
Is the kind of a liver that mean
men are supposed to carry about.
A doctor will tell you that no one
can live with a white liver.
When the liver is at all disor-
dered you are sure to have melan-
choly fits and to wish to be alone.
You will have all kinds of curi-
ous fancies and peculiar feelings.
If the disorder is only a functional
one the liver is easily restored to
its normal condition. If the dis-
order has its origin in the abuse
or dissipation of the man it is not
so easily controlled. Very few
family doctors pay much atten-
tion to nervous troubles. . As a
result the man who is so afflicted* â¢
will get no, comfort if he consults
his family doctor. This being ,*
true, hundreds of men are com-
pelled to try other cures. As a
result the Hudyan remedy treat-
ment "has been tried by many
thousands, and these thousands
have been cured. Just 10,000
men say Hudyan cures. Do you
believe them? You can see their
. statements in black and whi
s
It is a fact. Hudyan cures fail-
ing manhood, nervous debility,,
neurasthenia and disorders .of
man called private. You should
call on the Hudson doctors for
information about the Hudyan
remedy treatment or write for
Circulars and Testimonials.

Business.

Clairvoyant Visions.
The case of Edward Kline, the 18-year
old boy who was arrested for vagrancy at
the instance of his parents, who want to
remove him from the influences of the
Pacific Hypnotic Institute at 44 Sixth
street, was called in Police Judge Camp
bell's court yesterday. The case was con
tinued until to-day, but not before a num
ber of interesting features made their
appearance.
The boy's family live at 511 Minna street.
The father is a hard- working man, and
he has raided a family as industrious as
himself. Up to a few months ago E iward
held a position in a box factory on Market
street, but he threw up the situation and
ran away from home, after a brief ac
quaintance with P. A. Baker and H. M.
..Thornton, who conduct the hypnotic in
stil ute.
The lad went to live with these two
men who gave him $â â¢*â¢ per week and board
for his services as a "subject" for the stu
dents of hypnotism to practice upon.
The lad's parents endeavored to get him
to return to his home, but to no purpose,
and they claimed that an unknown
lower was being exercised upon their son
to keep him away from them. Hence the
arrest on Monday night by Officer Mc-
Murray. who is attached to the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
as the parents want to break the spell
that holds the lad from them.
When Mrs. Kline swore to the warrant
yesterday Judge Camp Dell made some in
quiry as to the facts. Although the war
rant was issued the Judge stated that
while it mignt be difficult to prove a case I
of vagrancy still the matter required a ]
thorough investigation. If ne found that j
the life the lad was leading was injuring
him he would put the boy out of harm's
way. The mother stated that her son is
much thinner than he was before he en
tered the services of the hypnotic prac
titioners.
Perry A. Baker, who figures as the in
structor in hytnotism of the institute,
made his appearance at court and inter
est-d himself greatly in the boy. He as
serted that the lad is not injured but
. rather benefited by being operated upjn
by- the amateurs in hypnotism, and he
Siiitect . that when the case comes up for
trial' he wiil bring witnesses to
prove What he said. Officer McMurrav
asked Perry why it was the young boy
tried to commit suicide a few weeks ago by
taking a large dose of carbolicacid if hyp
notic influence was a benefit instead of an
injury to him.
Perry explained that the reason tbat
young Kline tried to end his life was be
cause the youngster was deeply in love
\\ithayoung girl to whom his parents
oojecteJ. This was news to Mrs. Kline,
who declared that she never knew of her
son having tender feelings for any young
maiden. Perry explained that young
Kline was saved from death by carbolic
acid poisoning by i.ypnotic powers that
were thrown upon him. N
During the conversation young Kline
made a revelation that caused the Judge
to comb his whiskers vigorously with his
fingers. The boy, in telling of his life as a
"subject," stated that he was frequently
. called to do duty in the Parrott building,
where a club of lawyers r.nd business men
study the mysteries through his subjec
tive or passive nervous organism.
The lawyers, so the lad stated, would
throw him into a trance to make use of
his clairvoyant powers. They would send
his mind to read the minds of their cli
ents in order to secure more facts as to
cases in hand. They would also get him
to go out on similar occult expeditions to
probe the minds of opposing counsel in
order to get "tips" as to what their next
moves would be.
Others, the boy stated, were in search of
information as to mining stocks and the
probability of certain horses winning at
the races.
From what he could learn from these
seekers for inside facts the lad said he be
lieved that he gave them pretty straight
"pointers." At any rate he was in great
demand, for these club meetings or hyp
notic seances were held once a week, on
the fifth floor of the Parrott building.
Monday evening was the usual time
for these gatherings, which were always
attended by from a dozen to twenty men.
It is probable that in the investigation
to be made to-day in court tne names of
these people will come out in the testi
mony. In fact, the young fellow feels
sure that tho-e for whom he has been a
" subject will come to his rescue and try to
prove that he is not a vagrant and that
his mental submission to their wills is
not in any way an injury to him.

bution, j
The C-aimlttee on "Ways and Means
Hard at Work Preparing for
tbe Celebration.
No patriotic movement has taken a
firmer hold upon the public mind within
so short a time than that of Lincoln's
day. From all parts of the Nation letters
have been received by Professor W. W.
Stone containing greetings of encourage
ment and commendation for the thought
which suggested the dedication of a day
to one of America's greatest modern
patriots and statesmen.
; The committee on ways and means met
last nigi.t at headquarters, Joseph Steele
in the chair.
A communication was read from the
secretary of the Daughters of Liberty re
porting that an entertainment would be
given by Martha Washington Council at
Union-square Hall on the 12th of May, the
proceeds to go to the fund of the league.
Chairman Steele was requested to re
port to the president of Martha Washing
ington Council offering what assistance
was necessary.
it was suggested that the prospectnses
cf the league should be placed about the
hall and a table prepared, so t at any of
the audience wishing to sign the league
roll could do so during the course of the
evening by placing the name on the circu
lar and handing it in to the chairman.
President Stone, who was present,
stated that he had had a talk with Gen
eral W. H. L. Barnes, and that the gen
eral had agreed at some date in the near
future to deliver a lecture on Abraham
Lincoln. r J.J J
A communication was read from Eu
gene Wtegan, quartermaster, stating that
the books of certificates were now coming
in from the printer more rapidly, and he
would be able to supply the demand at
last.
The books in question are in the cus
tody 01 the storekeeper, at G. A. R. head
quarters, St. Ann's building, and can be
had on requisition from the president.
Discussion aro*-e as to the proper method
of putting the certificates out.
Mr. Handley suggested that the com
mittee recommend that the quartermaster
send at least one book of fitty certificates
to each post of th* G. A. R. on this coast,
in care of the adjutant of the post, with
directions as to the best methods of pro
cedure.
This was agreed to. Also to recommend
that each post appoint a school committee
to visit the schools throughout the coast,
calling the attention of the children to the
Lincoln League.
President Stone read a letter from
Unit, d States Senator George W. McÃride
of Oregon, warmly applauding the object
of the league, and inclosing a check for $5
wherewith to pay for a certificate of mem
bership.
The committee also recommended that
the president call upon the schools ana
churches committee for immediate action
in reeard to the apportionment of G. A.
K. veterans to the schools.
The president stated that Professor
Elisha Brooks had taken the matter under
advisement and woula during the course
of the present vacation week parcel out
the City schools to the several posts, ac
cording to membership, so that every
school in ihe City should be visited on
Lincoln day by a Grand Army veteran.
Some of the members present expressed
preference for certain schools, but the
president laughingly declared that Pro
fessor Brooks of the Girls' High School
was chairman of tbe school committee,
and hence was "boss" of the situation.

AN AFFECTING SPECTACLE
Gavin McNab Remarks Upon
Mr. Rainey and His Silver
'Service.
"Rewarded for Increasing the Burden
of the Fire Department Upon
the Taxpayers."
Gavin McNab is deeply affected by the
spectacle of Sam Rainey standing with
hat in hand and a sob in bis throat, re
ceiving tokens of deep esteem from the
Fire Department in the form of a set of
resolutions and a silver service.
"Ah 1 it is a remarkable exhibition," he
said yesterday. "Thoy are rewarding him
for having lobbied a bill through the
Legislature increasing their wages. Why
shouldn't they give him a silver.set? By
the same token the newspapers ought to
play tbe flesh off his bones. He has used
bis influence and methods in getting this
bill into the books increasing salaries that
have been entirely acceptable to the men,
or men in the same positions, during times
when money wat comparatively free and
prices and wages in other departments
were up. Now, wnen labor is crying for a
chance to earn bread, and real estate is
paying not above 3 per cent, he succeeds
in increasing the burden of the Fire De
partment upon tho taxpayer. Why
shouldn't they give him a silver set? The
.taxpayers have to foot the bill, don't
they?', Â;.;:. .:,â â â 
"lt is a said commentary. Here ls a
man wholly without any of the belter ele
ments, distinguished by his display of the
worst, who practically directs all the func
tions of our City government. An im
moral man and a man of no education, he
has the care of the morals and training of
our youth through his control of the
Board of Education. A briber and a man
of known dishonesty, be has charge of the
finances of the City, lt is an interesting
spectacle, indeed, this man being present
ed with a silver service for his meritorious
services and a set of resolutions crying
his virtues," and Mr. McNab swung halt
round in his Â« revolving office-chair and
looked sadly out over the chimney pots
that form the prospects from bis windows
in the Mills building.

WENT ASHORE IN
A NORTHWESTER
Schooner Nettie Sundborg
in Trouble at Hardy-
Creek.
Parted Five Lines and the Stern
Haws?r Could Not Held
Her off the 8.-ach.
The Employes of th; S. F. and N. P
Railroai Company Will EnJDy
Themselves To-Day.
Hawsers would not hold her and even
when the best bower lost its holding
ground the Nettie Sundborg made a brave
battle for life. Five lines wore out and
one after another they snapped like pack
threads. As it is the smart little schooner
is now high and dry on the beach between
Hardy and San Juan creeks, the chances
beine that she will be a total loss.
The Nettie Sundborg left San Francisco
a week aco to load bark for this port.
When off Hardy Creek the northwester
came up and five anchors were put out.
When the gale was at its height not ono of
them held and the stern line was the only
thing lhat held the vessel. A big breaker
came along and in a few minutes the
Sundborg was high and dry on the beach.
The men saw the wave coming and it
did not take them many seconds to get
into the rigging in order to escape the
overflow. All were finally rescued and
the fate of the schooner is still in doubt.
"The catastrophe happened between
Hardy and San Juan creeks," said Mr.May
er of Heyman & Mayer yesterday. "The
schooner had five anchors out, and, had
it not been for the fact that the stern an
chor held, not only the vessel but all
aboard would have been lost." The Sund
â  bore was built at Port Madison, Wash.,
in 1891, and is one of the finest vessels of
her class in the United States. She is 74
feet lone, 25 feet 4 inches broad and 6 feet
deep. Her net tonnage is about sixty
four tons, and a belter equipped craft
never left the port of San Francisco.
Chief Engineer Holmes of the Harbor
Commission is making a systematic ex
amination of the piles which have been
driven "along the front" during the last
ten years. Some of them have been down
for a generation, and all have been in the
mud long enough to test their durability.
Not one of them has made a showing thut
i would cause Mr. Holmes to change his
mind.
Rowe's method was on exhibition in the
Mechanics' Fair ten years ago, and the
inventor asked the State to pay him $250,
--000 for the secret. When his piles were
pulled "yesterday it was found that the
limnoria had eaten away the outside
dressing and the teredo. bad got in its
deadly work on the pile.
McKeon of Oakland also had a pile
down as a test, and the Para-line Paint
Company covered the remainder of the
wharf. The test was at Lombard-street
wharf, and was, therefore, at one of the
worst points on the water front. Accord
ing to the experts, the pile which the
Legislature asked, the State to pay $250,
--000 for is no good, the McKeon patent is
good for six years and the paraffine paint
still stands off the teredo.
The crack liner of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company â the Queen â has
been thorouehlv overhauled and put in
commission for* the Alaskan excursion
season. She will leave here the first week
in June, and is scheduled to leave Tacoma
on the Bth of .next month. Being one of

"Whenever a steamer or sailing vessel
has to leave part of her cargo behind the
papers never fail to make a note of the
fact," said Edwin Goodall yesterday, "but
when the other side of the question has to
be eiven to the ; public the story is dif
ferent." 'l'J -.' ,y .:â ' *,â¢>%: -â  *
Mr. Goodall* remarks were the result
of the following telegram:
:---V '--*â¢ vi â¢ Seattle, May 4.
Al-Ki arrived last night. Four cabin and 3
steerage passengers and 5 tons freight. Sails
to-morrow via Tacoma at 9 a. m. ,.
"The rush . lasted for three weeks," said
Mr. Goodall '. yesterday. "During ., that
time we had to put on extra boats, and
even then we could not handle the north
ward business. Now you see the result.
Ail our southbound vessels have to come
back in ballast. Miners for the Yukon,
cannery men for the canneries and men
for the coal mines are all anxious to make
an early appearance at the fields of opera
tion, ana in consequence all the steamers
are overcrowded. The Al-Ki tells the rest
of the story." '.Ji ;
On the tith inst. the steamer Santa Cruz
will be due bere from Alaska. Blie made
a special trip to the mines with passen
gers and is coming back in ballast. V
Tbe Orizaba on her way south stopped
at Kedondo, Cal., and took on twenty tons
of coal and a number of passengers. Busi
ness to Mexican ports is not rushing just
now.
The San Francisco and North Pacific

San Francisco. Cal., May 4, 1896. (
Captain William Tornstron of the schooner
Comet reports to this office that on April '.25,
in latitude 47 54 north, longitude 126 15 west
(or sixty miles we*-t-southwe-*t of Flattery), he
passed ft piece of bulkhead or partition irom
some vessel's cabin. The piece was eight feet
long by four feet broad, partly white painted
and partly grained. He also saw some other
pieces floating by.

and placed in a safe anchorage.
BICYCLE DEALERS MEET
They Decide to Adopt a Schedule
of Prices for Re
pairing.
The subject of regilding, re-enameling
and otherwise repairing bicycles at a loss
was elaborately discussed last night at an
informal meeting of the San Francisco
Bicycle Board of Trade in Varney's ware
room **. '* tJjyjyyJ
The matter was brought up by Mr.
Brand, who called attention to the com
paratively high rates charged in the East
ern and "Western States for repairing
wheels. He said that the bicycle repair
shops in this City were doing work: at an
actual loss in order to accommodate
wheelmen, and that there was no valid
reason why the practice should be con
tinued.
In St. Louis, Cleveland, Chicago, New
York, -Boston, Denver and other large
cities the shops bad signed a schedule of
rates to be charged for work, and this
schedule was adhered to. It was folly, he
said, for San Fran cisco dealers to sacri
fice themselves in these dull times, when
by having a mutual understanding and
living up to it the present drain on their
finances could be avoided.
Messrs. Varhey, Hamilton, Kennev,
Christ, Morrill, J argot and Leavitt spoke
in favor of a schedule, and it was decided
to take action in the matter at the next
meeting May 11. T- yr *â *
The subject of bicycle auction sales was
next taken up. It was stated that bicycle
factories often sent over a carload or two
of wheels and damped them upon -the
public by auction, thereby damaging the
local dealers by diverting that much trade
from them and tending to cut prices so
that the margin for profit . would be no
longer a mercantile but a precarious one.
It was agreed that each tales should' be
treated in the same light as circuses, and
that a heavy license of say $103 per day
should be imposed upon bicycle auc
tioneers.
The matter will be prosecuted at the
next meeting. j-JaX-.. ;,- -.'â¢/â¢ . i

VICTORY FOR THE
VALLEY ROAD
Its Traffic Agreement De
clared to Be Valid
and Secret.
No Discrimination Shown by
the Union Transportation
Company.
The Poller of the People's Road Said
to Bs in tbe Interest cf
Shippers.
Traffic agreements between connecting
common carriers are valid and are mat
ters only of private concern to the parties
directly interested. This in substance
was tho opinion officially rendered by the
Railroad Commissioners yesterday in con
nection with the complaint of the Union
Transportation Company against the
Valley road.
Complainant alleged that the contract
existing between the Valley road and the
California Navigation and Improvement
Company, which is a competitor of the
company, was illegal, because it excluded
the complainant from participating in
the through business of the Valley road
between San Francisco and points south
of Stockton.
At the session of the commission last
week exhaustive arguments were made
on the status of such traffic contracts.
The question was brought into issue by
the demand of the complainant for the
production of the contract before tbe
commission and for its introduction as
evidence.
The demand was resisted by E. F.
Preston, attorney for the Valley road, on
the ground that the contract cut no figure
in the charge of discrimination, as no dis
crimination resulted from its operation
to any shipper, and that a common car
rier, such as the complainant, has no legal
standing before the commission. He fur
ther demonstrated that the result of work
ing under that contract was to materially
reduce through rates for ail persons snip
pine into or out of the San Joaquin Val
ley. v~ h ':*;Â»-;-i
At the close of the previous session of
the commission the matter of the admis
sibility of the contract in evidence was
submitted to the Commissioner?, and a
copy of the contract was placed in their
hands by Attorney Preston for their pri
vate examination.
Chairman La Rue, speaking for himself
and Commissioner Stanton yesterday, ae
cided that the contract was in the interest
of tbe public, in so far that it made it pos
sible to give lower rates to shippers than
would otherwise be the case. They de
clared it to be valid, basing their judg
ment on a large number of authorities
that had been submitted to them, and
held that the complainant's curiosity to
be informed of the terms of said contract
could not justly be gratified. .
This decision was a decided victory for '
the Valley road, and virtually ended the
case. The complainant, however, asked
I leave to amend the complaint, and was
granted five days in which to do so. ' De
fendant has by statute ten days to file an
amended answer, but as Mr. Preston will
be busy with matters outside the City the
time for answering was extended by agree
ment until the meeting of the commission
on June 9.
It is understood that the object of filing
an amended complaint is to lav the basis
for taking the matter into the courts.

IMPUREBLOOD
Read What the Doctor Says About
Your Blood Impurities and Begin
to Assist Yourself to Get Well
and Strong.
YOU ARE ALWAYS COMPLAINING OF
HEADACHES. It comes on you in the
morning, at 10 o'clock in the evening, at
night. You are in despair. Everything seems
blue and blcck. Now, there is a cause for
this. There is a cause for ail disorders of hu-
manity. A good, strong, vigorous man or
woman is in perfect order physically. JUst as
soon as the blood begins to get thin and
watery, just so soon does your system show
these dreadful headaches. Headaches are a
sign, a symptom oi a disordered blood supply.
If the b. cod is poor you are quite likely to
know it, especially in the head. When your
blood is impure
You have nasty pimple*, _.*,.

Just as soon as you purify your blood these

JOY'S VEGETABLE SARSAPARILLA is a
purifier. It is a gmnd discovery.' When
the word grand is used it is meant to convey
to the mind the word wondrous. JOY'S VEGE-
TABLE SARSAPARILLA is really a wonderful
prescription. It is a blooi-puriiier and a laxa-
tive. Instead of driving the impurities of the
blood through the pores of the skin, these im-
purities are caused to gently run through the
proper channels of nature. You don't need to
take nasty pills, beastly iodide of potash, mer-
cury or other mineral poisons. When a sub-
stitute is offered, when some one tries to talk
you into taking something which is just as
good, be sure , the "just as good" contains no
pimple-producing, blor d-bleaching, corrosive
poisons. Don't be talked into buying a dollar

The German statesman who in his

bears the title, Count yon Kanitz-Podan

Now that a Chinaman in Boston has set
up as a reformer and begun an agitation

The proposal of some of the members of

strong enough to master it.
To Senator Morgan's plea for immediate

Since the election last November Bryan

Ihe quarrel between Morgan and Till
man in the Senate, taken in connection
with the dispute between Bailey and
Simpson in the House, shows that even
among the Democrats who supported*
Bryan and survived the tidal wave of last

nor any unity of purpose. Each is light

po.r list in doing it.
The appointment of a son of General
Daniel E. Sickles to be secretary of the

the Government intends to pursue a vig

Young Sickles lias lived much of his life

known, but bis father is one of the strong

Cuba in the country and there is reason

THE TARIFF.
The Republican members of the Finance Committee of the Senate have finished
the wtrk of revising the Dingley bill as it came from the House and have now sub
mitted it to the Senate.
According to tbe programme, it is intended that the bill shall be taken up for con
sideration on Tuesday. How long the debate will continue and what will be the for
tunes that await the measure cannot be accurately foreseen. The strength of the par
ties in the ifenate is so evenly divided that a comparatively few men will be able by
acting together to either bring about alterations in its schedules or else inaefinitcly
postpone i;s passage. This fact renders speculations concerning the measure un
certain in every respect, and industry and commerce cannot yet consider them
selves out of .the woods. fl
The revision makes so many changes in the rates of various schedules that it is
equivalent to a new measure. The retroactive clause is stricken out, and so also is
the entire provision made by the House for reciprocity treaties. Western interests
gain something and lose something. The duties are raised on citrus fruits, but low
ered on prunes, raisins, plums and dried grapes. Lower grades of wool get a better
protection, but the higher grades have reduced duties. So it goes through the entire
measure and the subject will have to be s udied anew before a definite conclusion is
reached concerning it.
It gees without saying that California expects her delegation in Congress to work
earnestly to restore the duties on frnits, oilier than citrus, as they were fixed by the
House. ; The measure of protection granted there was a duty of 2% cents, and that
was none too large to cover tbe difference in freights which California shippers have
to pay as compared with European shippers who have the advantage of ocean com
munication win Atlantic seaboard. Fortunately there is little or no danger that the
bill will be rushed through the Senate. Time will be given there for deliberation and
Californians have a chance to present their claims. Protests against the proposed
reductions should be sent in at once. Debate in the Senate begins next week. This
is the time to act. -
MONEY NEEDED.
Money is needed for Balboa avenue. It
is needed urgently and it is needed right
now. It should be forthcoming promptly
and liberally. Not much is required in
comparison with what has been given. A
few thousand dollars more will be suffi
cient to compete the work without delay,
but if it is not contributed at once the
labor will soon cease for lack of funds.
More tban $28,700 has been contributed,
but less than $3000 remains. It is believed
that less than $6000 more will put the
road into condition lor use. The sum re
maining on hand, however, will not last
much longer at the present rate of ex
penditure, as there are about 250 men and
thirty teams at work. Unless, therefore,
within a very few days more money is
raised progress on the improvement will
be stopped.
It is announced that assistance from the
cyclers is not coming in as rapidly as the
public had reason to expect. Many wheel
men have given individually, but very
few of these organizations nave acted in a
body. It is certainly not too much for the
public to expect better evidences of inter
est in good roads on the part of wheel
men's a-sociations than have been given
so far, and it is to be hoped that they will
take speedy action toward raising a con
siderable portion of the money necessary
to complete this grand avenue which
will be of such benefit to them when
opened.
In addition to the wheelmen's associa
tions there are many other clubs and or
ganizations in the City that ought to act
ively aid in tha work. This is a civic en
terprise In the fullest s?nse of the word,
and is one in which every citizen ought to
take a sufficient interest to be willing to
help and feel a sufficient pride to make
that help something of which he might
be proud. We have gone so far in this
enterprise and expended so much money
on it that it would be a very poor policy
to abandon it now.
The road itself and the public apprecia
tion of it, as shown by the number of
visitors, are all that could be desired. The
workers have teen faithful in their em
ployment and have rendered a large
amount of labor for low wages. The
directers have been zealous and energetic
in their management, and as they have
served without pay they have -et an ex
ample which every man of public spirit
should feel desirous of emulating as far as
lies in his power. The appeal that now
comes for more money should, therefore,
be cordially and generously responded to.
We ought to have the money in the hands
of thecommittee in time so that the work
may be continued without a single inter
ruption for even a day.
DEMOCRATIC DISSENSIONS.
The proceedings In the House of Repre
sentatives on Monday demonstrated that
the dissensions in the Democratic ranks
continue to be strong enough to disturb
the discipline of the party, and that the
new leader, Mr. Bailey, is altogether in
, competent either to allay them by tact or
to dominate them by strength of character
and force of will. Democracy to-day is as
hopeieafly divided a ever, and having
been incompetent to carry on the Gov
ernment in now showing itself impotent
even to conduct a well-ordsred opposition.
In the present case a Democratic (action
has been started by even such an irre
sponsible person as Jere Simpson of Kan
sas. It is as if the wild colts had been
stamped by a wilder calf and were follow
ing his lead despite al! th.it could be done
to stop them. Mr. Bailey's attitude in
the matter was ludicrous. Being power
less to hold his force- together he could
do no more than stand in the House and
scold them for breaking away.
The occasion was one which might well
have made an older, abler and more ex
perienced leader than Mr. Bailey fretful
and impatient. He bad induced the
Democrats of the -use to adopt a certain
line of policy, and was carrying out that
policy himself with no little discretion.
At the first opportunity, however, a con
siderable number of those who had agreed
to that policy originally broke away from
it to follow an erratic Populist, who had
apparently no policy whatever, and was
merely trying to achieve notoriety for
himself by attacking the Speaker.
Mr. Bailey's speech to bis bolting party '
had its pathetic as well as its ludicrous
side. "I am heartily sick and tired," he
said, "of exhibiting to the country the
dissensions and division that unfortu
nately exist in the Democratic party. It
would seem that the minority might
without friction unite on some policy.
When we see our great opponent united
on all great questions, sometimes against
Its judgment, and turn to me our own
side hopelessly divided on a mere ques
tion of parliamentary procedure, it is a
pitiful sight we present to the country."
It is truly a pitiful spectacle this once
great party is now presenting to the
country. Incompetent alike in office and
out of it, it seems incapable of rendering
a service to the country of any character
whatever. It has neither it icy, a dis
cipline, nor a leader by which it stands
with any consistency or continuity. It
has decomposed into a wrangling confu
sion of jealousies, rivalries and follies,
and there seems to be no man in its ranks
who is capable of reorganizing it and mak
ing it once more worthy of the name of a
National party.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AY 5, 1897.
A LEADER WANTED.
The reports from the various corre
spondents at the seat of war are conflict
ing in many respects, but they seem
agreed in one thingâ that the success of
the Turks has been due not more to their
courage and the generalship of Edhem
Pasha than to the lack of a leader in the
Greek army capable of fitly opposing to
the Turkish advance the valor and patriot
ism of the Greek people.
It is another illustration of the wisdom
of the saying of the old Greek philosopher
that an army of hares led by a lion could
defeat an army of lions led by a hare. Al
most every nation in the world has at
some time in its history had an experi
ence of that truth. The French led by
Napoleon easily overran Germany; but
in the last war with that country, lacking
a great general, they were not even able
to defend their own country, The Prus
sians, who, under Frederick the Great,
had defied the alliance of nearly all
Europe, were crushed into utter im
potence a generation later by a single bat
tle at Jena, and not until old Blucher rose
to high command and inspired them with
confidence did they suc:eed in m&Klng a
contest worthy ofa great people.
The British race has had similar experi
ences. An army that could take Quebec
under General Wolfe dared not, when
commanded by Lord Howe, assault
Vailey Forge. Nor hava we been
without our lesson of the same kind. The
armie*- which, under Pope and Burnside,
could not withstand the assaults of Gen
eral Lee, advanced to a speedy and over
whelming victory under Grant.
When great. crises occur in the history
of nations and no right leader comes to
the front to meet them the worst qualities
of a race are manifest- At the present
time the Greek army shows very little of
the qu.vity that has made the word Spar
tan synonymous with fortitude in every
language of the civilized world. The
army and the people alike now appear
ficstle, inconstant and irresolute. These
weaknesses, however, would goon disap
pear if there should arise to (he command
of the army any man who is at all equal
to the occasion and capable of leading it
with a true hetoism and great general
ship. In the possibility of finding that
leader .'ies now the only hope of the
Greeks, and this hope is a faint one. So far
as we can learn from the correspondents
at the front there is hardly a man suffi
ciently prominent to attract the attention
of the people who has in him anything to
enable aim to play the art of the savior
of his country.

Washington Post. .-..â¢*::,.:;:
Senator William E. Mason has made the
record as the champion indorser of this ad
ministration. There are a dozen instances
which show his readiness to oblige. The other
day a triend wanted to read him a letter about
some matter relating to the tariff. They hap
pened to meet at the White House. The friend
pulled out the letter and prefaced it, or sought
to preface it, with a snort ezplanatlon.
"That's all riehi," said Senator Mason, "of
cour-e I'll indorse you- Got your application
ready, I see. That's the way to do things.
Here, give me a pen and I'll put down my sig
nature now and take it right in and hand our
application to the President. I'll say a word
to him about you. too."
Before the astonished friend could say a
word Senator Mason had seized a pen, written
his signature and was pushing forward to Sue- j
reiary Porter's room, to the presence of Presi
dent McKtnley. As the letter has not gone
back to its owner it Is presumed that the Illi
nois Senator kept his word and handed it to
the President, who referred it to the executive
clerks; but they must be puzzling themselves
to determine to what department it shall be
sent. * ______________ââÂ» ;'*:* :; ;-: r-yjy

Monday night next celebrate its first anniver
sary by an entertainment and dance in As
sembly Hall in the Odd Fellows' building.
This is the only Rebekah lodge that admits to
membership young ladies who are not related
to members of tho order. This was started as
an experiment, and it has proved very suc
cessful. The membership on the Ist inst. was
ninety, and oa last Monday six candidates
were Initiated. That same night the lodge
was presented by some of its members with a
handsome altar, and four beautiful banners.
For the celebration the committee of ar
rangements which has had the matter in
charge for several weeks has prepared an ex
cellent programme, in which tne most attrac
tive features will be beau'ifnl ifving pictures.
One oi these will be ' -the bust of an Odd Fel
low we all know," and it will be truer to lite
than the work of a sculptor. Who the well
known Odd Fellow is vi i.l be kept a secret un
til the curtain Is raised. From the charming
entertainments given in the past by tnis
lodge it is not saying too much to announce
that this one will equal, if not surpass, any

Frank. Hall, on Fillmore street, was taste
fully decorated last evening in red and yellow

make it attractive for the entertainment and
social given by Branch No. 19 of the Catholic
Ladies' Aid Society in aid of its fun I lot the
relief of the sick and needy who come under
its care.
There was a good attendance whicn was en

MILLER & LUX TO
WIND UP AFFAIRS
All the Property .Is to Be
Sold as Soon as
Possible.
Twelve Million Dollars' Worth
ot Land Stock to Be Thrown
s on the Market.
Wi 1 R quire at Least a Dczsd V ars
to Dispcse of the Vast Inter
ests Involved-
With a capital stock of $12,000,000 the
great firm of Miller & Lux has been incor
porated, the articles for that object being
filed with County Clerk Curry yesterday.
The directors and incorporators of the
new concern that will succeed to the mi
i terests of the old partnership known as
j the firm of Miller & Lux are Henry Mil
ler, Henry Lux, Thomas B. Bishop, J. Le
roy Nickel, Edward T. Allen, Jesse 8. Pot
ter and Azro N. Lewis.
It is set forth in the articles of incorpor
j ation that the incorporators have, to start
j with, eubscnted for two shares each, the
', shares having a par value of $100. Their
I subsequent holdings of stock in the cor-
I poration will be subject to the arrange
, ments that are entered into when turning
i over the property of the firm to the cor-
I poration, the final disposal of which is de
i clared to be the prime -purpose of the new
i organization. This property consists of
! cattle on several thousand hills, as well as
â¢ the hills themselves, and extends from
Oregon to Texas.
In addition to carrying on a general
stock-raising busi-ness and dealing in cat
tle, hogs and sheep, the articles provide
i that the corporation may engage in butch
| ering in all its branches, may acquire
[ â vater rights and establish irrigating
i works, construct dams, levees, weirs,
'â  canals and all such appliances; may lo
cate and lay out townsites and sell lots in
! quantities to suit purchasers or tbe con
| venience of the corporation.
All these things are to be done with the
j aim in view of gradually selling off the
1 property, which is to be done "as speedily
I as in the judgment of a majority of the
J board of directors of the corporation such
| disposition can fairly and advantageously
j be effected, and to divide the proceeds
I thereof among the stockholders."
Ther- is a provision in the articles that
' "pending such disposition of said prop
j erty, and solely for'ihe purpose of avoid
; ing depreciation in the value of said prop-
I erty and a consequent loss, and subsidiary
j to said main purpose, the directors are
I empowered to carry on the business of the
I late Miller & Lux partnership-"
Btiict limitations to the powers of the
dir. cors are provided In the articles of
incorporation to compel the winding up
of the affairs of the corporation. All
stock issued shall be deemed to be fully
paid up, and no assessment shall be levied
thereon except by unanimous vote and
consent of all the directors, and no vote
j shall be taken on this subject, while there
| is a vacancy in the board of directors or
I win nail the members of the board are not
I personally present. 'yJj'
. Tne corporation is not permitted to pur
â¢ chase any real property or increase the
I personal property of the corporation
i above the aggregate amount on hand at
I the time of the transfer of said property
j from the firm of Miller & Lux to the cor
j poration, unless such purpose be requested
I in writing by the holders of at least four
[ filths of the issued capital stock, and no
i vote on that question shall be taken at
i any time when there is a vacancy in the
board or when all the directors are not
personally present.
Similarly stringent rules are laid down
{ to compel the immediate distribution of
t profits of the business and proceeds of sale
of the property owned or to be owned by
the corporation, and the directors are not
allowed to keep on hand more than $50,000
to meet the future expenses of business.
No director shall be competent to vote
on these questions unless he be a director
elected by the stockholders at the regular
annual meeting and no amendment to the
articles of incorporation shall be had in
these matters except by unanimous vote
of the directors as provided in regard to
the other affairs mentioned, and by the
vote or written consent of stockholders
representing at least four-fifths of the cap
| ital stock of the corporation.
One cause of complaint on the part of
tne Lux interests in the Miller & Lux busi
ness has been that Henry Miller, the sur
viving partner, persisted in extending the
limits of the partnership, thus absorbing
the profits instead of paying cash divi
! dends to the representatives of his late
I partner. It was generally acknowledged
that his investments were wise and that
! uli-mately they would be remunerative to
the firm, but those representing the Lux
interests desired a contraction rather
than an extension of the firm's affairs.
After some litigation a compromise was
reached resulting in the organization of
the corporation mentioned here. It is be
lieved ti.at it will take nearly a dozen
I years to wind up the affairs of this great
j company, which is prohablv the largest
concern of the kind in the United States
| and probably an iarue as any in the world.

heaps of bread and pies, mixed with
broken glass, indicates to a nicety the time i;
the explosion occurred.
It was an explosion everybody says, but
there is not a being within blocks of the
locality who can tell anything more than
that he or she was violently bumped out
of bed during the early hours of the morn
ing, and in the wake. til hours that fol
lowed witnessed the burning of Heidt
man's saloon.
It is evident from the wrecked appear
ance of Mrs. Joseph Blaes' store that
some poweriul explosive had taken action
next door. Still, Proprietor Heidtman de
clared to the Fire Marshal that nothing of
a combustible nature was ever kept in his
house. When he closed his saloon at mid
night, Henry Wehner, the barkeeper, who
goes on at 6 o'clock in the morning, was
the only man about the premises. He was
asleep in a back room.
Wehner had retired about 10 o'clock,
and the first intimation he had of trouble
was when his bedroom at the back ol the
saloon fell apart and the flames sur
rounded him. He was considerably
burned and was conveyed for treatment
to 464 Foisom street, where be is in a
critical condition.
The concussion resulting from the ex
plosion was felt by people five blocks
away. -.'-*"'â 
Fortunately there was no one seriously
hurt besides Henry Whener, the bar
keeper.
Mrs. Blaes, the mother of Joseph Blaes,
owner of the coffee-saloon, next door to
the place where the explosion occurred,
was caught in the dense smoke aud was
| unable to help herself out.
At this juncture John Cosgrove, a mem
ber of the firm of Cosgrove Brothers, on
! the opposite corner of Foisom street, made
| his way into the house, broke into the
I old lady's room and carried her to the
j fresh air.
Tbe insurance on the Heidtman saloon,
! amounting to $1100, in the Bremen
i Hambur.* Company, is less than half the
j value of the stock taken by Heidtman in
! March last.
Fire Marshal Towe while investigating
the ruins found a price list of giant pow
der and dynamite partially burnt. He
attached considerable importance to it
and took possession of it.
The Fire Marshal is satisfied that the
explosion was caused by dynamite, from
the fact that the walls fell inward and not
outward. He is also satisfied that the
dynamite was in the portion of the build
ing used as the saloon and close to the
wall dividing it from Blaes' bakery.
"My bartender, Henry Wehner," said
Heidtman to the Marshal, "went to bed
about half- past 10 o'clock. He slept in a
small room in the rear. I locked up the
place shortly before 12 o'clock and went
home to bed.
"I was awakened from my sleep by
â¢ Wehner, who told me the saloon was on
fire. He was burnt about the arras and
legs and complained of pains in his chest.
My wife attended to his burns while I
went to the fire. After I returned I
wanted to take Wehner to the German
Hospital, but he preferred to go to friends
on Foisom street, and I took him there
and called in a doctor.
"I took possession of the place In Au
gust last, with a partner. He sold out
and I continued the business myself. I
took stock in March and it amounted to
$1400. lam insured in two companies for
$1100. i would not have sold out for less
than $1500, as it was a paying business."
Heidtman positively denied that any
dynamite or any explosive material was
in the place to his knowledge, and he de
clared he knew nothing of the price-list
for dynamite and giant powder.
The Fire Marshal laid the matter before
Captain Bohen, who detailed Detective
Dillon on the case. ,
Detective Dillon bad an interview with
WÂ« liner, the bartender, last night,
Wehner said: "I went to bed about
half-past 10 and was awakened by the ex
plosion. I was thrown out of my bed,
and, seeing the flames, I hastily pulled on
my trousers and boots and jumped out of
the window. Then I went to Heidtman's
house and told him that the placs was on
fire."
Dillon asked him if he saw or spoke to
I any one alter leaving the burning build
ing and be said he did not think
so. The fact is, he spoke to Mr.
and Mrs. Chris Pecole of 3104 Twenty
sixth street. They were awakened by the
noiaeof the explosion and both jumped
| out of bed and ran outside. Pecole took
time to pull on his trousers, but his wife
ran out in her nightrobe.
They told the detective that Wehner
was fully dressed and he came up to them
I â *nd asked them where the fire be. Is were
j ringing. Then he turned round the cor-
I ncr and disappeared.
Dillon asked him what was the value of
the si< ck in tho place and he said he did
I not know. Finally he said he thought it
wax tetween $1000 and $1100.
Wehner was also seen by Fire Marshal
Towel He practically told him the same
story. The Fire Marshal asked him if he
knew anything about the price list for
dynamite and he replied in the negative.
Wehner was arrested on April 7 of last
year for felony embezzlement. He was
mixed up with Martha. Godschauk in the
case of Carl Voght, a musician from Ger
many, who was swindled out of over $2000
by the woman. The par icular charge
against Wehner was for obtaining $850
from Attorney J. P. Sweeney on an order
purporting to be signed by Vocht. He
whs held to answer before the Superior
Court on April 21, but he was not con
victed.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 5, 1897.
The Ruins Left by the Explosion at Twenty-Sixth and Foisom Streets.
A CROWD A REFUGE
FOR A BURGLAR
John Harris Walks Unob
served Out of Judge
Low's Court.
Forced a Rail Off the Dock and
Managed to Crawl
Through.
He Was Assisted by an Acc:mp!ice
and Detectives Are Trying to
Find Thtm.
In a crowded courtroom John Harris,
i alias Collins, a burglar, succeeded in mak
ing his escape yesterday morning and his
absence from the dock was not noticed un
til half an hour later.
â  Harris is the man charged with the burg
lary at Morsheart & Son's office, Wash
ington and Drumni streets, last Friday
afternoon. He was not booked till Mon
day night and yesterday was taken from
the City Prison to Judge Low's court along
J* HARRIS, the Criminal Who Escaped From the Courtroom.
with eight other prisoners and placed in
the dock.
The dock is surrounded by a wooden
railing. Harris took a seat nearest the
door. About 10:30 o'clock Detective Egan
and Policeman Ellis, who arrested him,
spoke to him and asked if he w as prepared
to have his examination go on. Harris re
plied that he would like a continuance
and Egan said he wou d return later and
consent to a continuance.
Egan and Ellis returned to the court
shortly after 11 o'clock. They observed
that Harris was not in the dock with the
other prisoners, and Egan asked Clerk
Farrell if Harris' case had been continued.
Farrell looked at his calendar and said
the case had not been called.
Egan asked both Bailiff Clarke and
Policeman Wallace if they had taken
Harris back to the prison, but they assured
him they had not done so, and he must
be in the dock. An examination of the
dock was made and it was discovered that
one of the wooden rails had been forced
off, leaving a space sufficient for a man of
ordinary size to crawl through.
It then became apparent that Harris
had escaped Irom t- c dock by crawling
through the hole, but how the rail could
have been broken off and Harris crawl
through without being heard and ob.
served by the officers in the court or the
spectators is a mystery that. is puzzling
the police. All the people in court were
Interrogated by Captain Bohen, but they j
all denied hearing any noise or seeing any
one crawling through the hole. .
It was ascertained later that an accom
plice was in the courtroom and aided
Harris in making his escape. He is
known to the police. The accomplice
took his seat on the bench close to the
dock where Harris was sitting and the
probability is that he broke off the rail,
as the bronen piece was found behind the
bench. Harris and his friend w*-re seen
to Uave the City Hall by the Larkin
street exit and board a south-bound cable
car. Every effort will ba made to recap
ture Harris, but the chances are not hope
ful. -. -J jjy. r- J. , -â â :..--. . y.y-yfyi
Besides the burglary of Morshead &
Son's office Harris answers the description
. . \yy y . 'â  - * -
of the man who broke into the ticket
offices at the ferry depots and stole all the
money in the cash drawers.
He was arrested a week ago for being
drunk and carrying a concealed weapon.
Judge Low released him on his own
recognizance at the request of Attorney
Gallagher, and next morning Harris failed
to appear in court, and a oench warrant
was issued for his arrest. He was cap
tured on Kearny street Friday night while
drunk, nnd next morning was identified
as the man who roLbed Morshead & Son's
safe.
It was at first thought he was an East
ern crook, but the police discovered be is
a local man and has a brother living in
the City. |
Last night Captain Polien discovered
that Harris is an old offender. His real
name is John Collins and when between
18 and 19 years of age h<* was arrested for
petty larceny, on May 20, 1891. He gave
the name of William Sweeney. He got off
with a light sentence, but on September 5
following he was again arrested for burg
lary and having burglars' tools in his pos
session, and was sent to the Whittier Re
formatory for two and a half years. On
this occasion he.gave the name of Henry
Waiting. On January 3, 1894, he was ar
rested for petty larceny and got six months
in the County Jail. At that time he was
not recognized as having been- previously
convicted. ________________

Agent Grunwaldt Gets a
Franchise for the Ten
Great Rivers.
He Will Build Large Canneries
and Ship to tie Cities
of Europe. I
Ruisia Will Act With America in
Brandin* F male Seals for
Their Protection-
C. M. Grunwaldt, general aeent and
manager of the Russian Sealskin Com
pany, which owns all the franchises for
hunting, trapping and trading on Copper
and Behring islands and in Kamchatka,
after several months in different parts of
Europe, is at the Occidental. .
Mr. Grunwaldt left here late last fall,
after Lis return to the Siberian islands
alluded to, for Kamchatka. He has since
been at his home In St. Petersburg, and
has also visited England, Germany, Italy
and other countries.
He is accompanied on his return by
Alexis, de Prosovof, a young Russian
nobleman, the son of the Private Coun
selor of State for Russia. For a year past
i till now he has been in the army, serving
under the Grand Duke Sergius. His idea
now in going to the Siberian and Kara
chatkan wilderness is to recruit his
health by rugged outdoor life.
Mr. Grunwaldt --ays the Russian Gov
ernment is in favor of branding the
female seals lor their protection, the same
as is this country.
"The Russian Government is going to
co-operate with America," he said, "in her
efforts for an international agreement to
stop pelagic sealing. The country is per
fectly willing to brand the female seas,
and is ready to begin as soon as America
is. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, tbe
Russian Embassador at Washington and
the Russian Consul-General at New York
are our commissioners in regard to the
seals. The two latter gentlemen are now
at St. Petersburg. Russia is as anxious to
protect the seals as is the United States.
"The most important new venture my
company is now engaged in is fishing fur
salmon iv the rivers of Kamchatka.
There are millions of fine salmon there.
They have red .flesh, are in appearance
much like the salmon of the Columbia
and are of excellent flavor. Last year my
company sent expeditions to the rivers
and began catching and salting them as
an experiment. It was in every a
success.
"Tne result is that we this winter ob
tained exclusive franchises to take the
fish from ten of the largest rivers. We
will establish large canneries and ship the
salmon to the different parts of Europe."
Agent Grunwaldt and Mr. de Prosavof
will Vail on the Kotik Saturday evening.
Mr. de Prosovoi's brother is one of the
partners in the company.

GENERAL DUDLEY
IN THE CITY
The Man Who Became
Famous by His "Blocks
of Fixe" Letters.
Ec Says He Has Come in Order
to Bring His Wife' for
Her Health.
Irving W. Dttdl y of San Diego, H;
Thinks, Will Undcubtedly Bs
Minister to Peru
General W. W. Dudley of Washington,
D. C, the distinguished lawyer, brother of
ex-Judge Irving W. Dudley of San Diego,
arrived here yesterday, accompanied by
Mrs. Dudley, his daughter and Miss Wake
field. He was met at the Palace soon
alter his arrival by M. M. Estee. Major
McLaughlin, Jacob Steppacher and other
Republicans. Mr. Dudley said, in refer
ence to his trip and appointments to be
made by President McKinley:
j "I have come to the coast on a brief
I trip and merely for the benefit of Mrs.
Dudley's health." I will start back Thurs
day or Friday, probably, if my wife's
health will permit. When I left Wash
ington a week ago it was arranged that
Judge Dudley would be appointed Minis
ter to Peru. As for myself, lam like Mr.
Estee, I am busy practicing law."
General Dudley was not inclined to be
interviewed at length. He said there was
no news in his visit, as he was not doing
politics now, but . was attending to his
profession.
It Is only a few years ago, in one of the
hottest political campaigns that has ever
been held, that Dudley wrote the iaraou*
"blocks of five" letter, which was taken
up by the Democrats and used for all it
was worth. This was at a time when
Duiley was living in Indiana, and was
bearing a strong hand not only in State
but National politics. It was at a time
when a few votes rated for a good deal.
The attention attrccted to Dudley was
general, and he was caricatured in the
opposition press, and in every way shown
in as bad a light as possible. Since that
time he has lived rather a quiet life. He
has been practicing law at Washington,
and till now has not visited this part of
the country. j
He has held a number of offices during
his long political career, the most im
portant one, however, being United States
Commissioner of Pensions. This appoint
ment he received in 1881.
General Dudley went to Indiana from
Vermont as a young man, and while there
the war broke out. He enlisted a3 a cap
tain and in a little while was brevet
brigadier-general. When the war ended
he was County Clerk, attorney, banker
and United States Marshal till he was
made United States Commissioner of Pen
sions,
He is of good size and of an engaging
manner. His hair and mustache are now
almost white. Major McLaughlin, chair
man of the Republican Stale Central Com
mittee, had a long talk with him last
night. General Dudley also visited the
Union League Club.
Quintana on Trial.
J. N. Quiniana of San Luis Obispo County,

ANOTHER
ENTRANCE
TO THE PARK
Supervisors Are Planning
an Important Im
provement
STANYAN STREET TO BE
WIDENED.
The Depot of tbe Park and
Ocean Railroad Must Be
Removed.
WILL BENEFIT THE MISSION
RESIDENTS.
A Gateway at the Intersection of
Frederick and Stanyan Streets
to B; Arranged.
The residents of the Mission who desire
to visit Golden Gate Park will soon have
a new entrance opened for their special
benefit, and one that will obviate a long
detour to gain the present entrance be
tween Fell and Oak streets.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors has been figuring on the mat
ter for some time, and has concluded that
the improvement is needed and at once.
In order to make the plan feasible it will
be necessary to clear away the obstruc
tions that now block the way, and a begin
ning was recently made when it was de
cided to require tbe Park and Ocean Rail
road depot on Stanyan street, between
Waller and Haight, removed.
The Market-street Company was ap
prised of the matter a couple of weeks
ago, but as no answer was received the
following letter was addressed to Secretary
Willcutt of the company yesterday;

that point the prettiest parts of the park
are reached by a short route, and if a
driveway could be constructed to connect
with the south drive it would add much
to the comfort of those who come from
the portions of the City mentioned, and
particularly from the Mission. The Joost
line of cars terminates there, and pedes
trians could avoid the wait to the other
entrances.
"The plan we have outlined is first to
widen and improve Stanyan street to its
termination on Clarendon Heights. In
order to do this the Park and Ocean Rail
road depot must be removed. â .
"It occupies a portion of the sidewalk
now, and the tracKs and fences that sur
round them obstruct the street to a very
material extent. We have allowed the
fences to stand in the street thus far be
cause of the danger arising from the
steam-cars, but they will have to make
way for the march of improvement.
"The company has no franchise for a
depot that takes up the sidewalk, and it
must be changed to some other location.
Then there will be a clear way to the cor
ner of the park, and it will be an easy
matter to construct an entrance there.
The people want it, and we will give them
every assistance in our power to get it."
THE LAND FOE THE IDLE.
Major Win* hell Will Soon Work on His
Unemployed Scheme.
Major "Wincheil of the Salvation Army
says plans are under way for a great deal
of active work in favor of the colonization
scheme, but nothing of any importance
will be done until the unemployed finish
their wort on the boulevard.
"Mr. Bunker has informed us," he said
yesterday, "that the unemployed will be
engaged in their present work for at least
ten days more. When they finish their
labors it is my intention to do all I can to
establish a farm for the unemployed some
where within easy reach of the City. If
properly managed I believe it will pay
and prove a successful economic experi
ment."
The army has delayed its Work wholly
on account of the engagement of the un
employed ****** the Balboa boulevard.

J. W. Whiting is chairman of the union
picnic committee and C. B. Perkins is j
secretary. They and their assistants have
done all in their power to make the union
picnic a success. The park is quite near
the town of Los Gatos, a spot where nature i
and art have combined to provide a veri
table picnickers' paradise. A strip of al
most level land lies along the left bank of
the creek, groves of live oak and sycamore
and giant cypresses stretch out their wide
spreading branches, beneath whose grate
ful shade a large and well-built platform
has been erected, surrounded by a large
number of tables for the convenience of
excursionists. Open spacs among the j
trees afford opportunity for all kinds of ]
athletic sports.

INDIAN LIFE.
Superintendent Daggett Discourses of It
to a Large Audience.
Interest in the lectures given under the
auspices of the Academy of Sciences is
growing more popular with each one de
livered. The audience that gathered to
listen to John Daggett, the Superintend
ent of the Mint, speak on the subject of
"Indian, Life in Northern California"
taxed the lecture-room of the building to
its full seating capacity, and many were
satisfied to stand. There was quite a num
ber of ladies present.
The remarks of the lecturer were illus
trated by a fine series of stereopticon
views.
Among other things Mr. Daggett de
clared that at one time the northern pari,
of the State afforded sustenance for as
many as 700,000 Indians, and made the
startling claim tbat at one time in certain
sections the land supported more Indians
than it would ever support whites. f
He traced a similarity in some things of
'he Indians of the north, such as the
Klamaths, with those of the aborigines of
Mexico, who were more than a thousand
miles apart. His lecture largely com
prised a review of the life and habits of
the natives as indicated by the relics tbat
have been found of their time and manu
facture. * . "
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 5, 1897.
SHE HAD A VERY
NARROW ESCAPE
Breakdown on the Stern
wheel Steamer T. C.
Walker.
Escaping Steam Nearly Caused
; Panic Aboard the
Vessel.
Tugs Were Sent Out, but the Steamer
Was Run on th 9 Berkeley
Mud Flats.
Passengers for Stockton by the steamer
T. C. Walker got a groat scare last night.
The big river boat left Washington-street
wharf at 6 p. M. and half an hour later was
off Angel Island. Then one of the steam
pines burst and in a few minutes the ves
sel was enshrouded in steam aud the en
gines had come to a standstill. .
The accident was noticed from the office
of the Shipowners' and Merchants' Tug
boat Company, and the tug Rescue was at
once sent out. The ferry-boats Tiburon
and San Rafael were both making time
and in spite of the fact that Captain Dan
Thompson whistled for the right of way
both of them held on and he had to pass
astern of them.
In the meantime the Walker was drift
ing toward the Berkeley mad flats, and
when the tug reached her she was in a
safe anchorage. Captain Thompson of*
fered to tow her back to San Francisco,
but the pilot reiused, saying that in an
hour or so the damage would be repaired
and the steamer could proceed on her way.
The Walker had at leas* 150 passengers
aboard, while the Dauntless had almost
the same number. Both steamers left the
wharf at tne same time and it was nip
and tuck almost to the Brothers. The
Dauntless had, if anything, the better of
the race up to the time the Walker burst
her steampipe, and now the first news of
tne trouble on the California Navigation
and Improvement Company's boat will
reach Stockton on the Dauntless.
When the captain of the T. C. Walker
found that he could not proceed without
repairs he at once beached hi" vessel on the
mud flats and sent to San Francisco for
assistance. Mechanics were sent out and
as soon as the repairs nad been made the
steamer proceeded on her way.
No one was scared over the accident,
even though the Walter was enveloped in
a steam cloud for ten minutes, and the
only inconvenience was the delay. All
the necessary repairs will be made at
Stockton to-night and the Walker will
make her run to San Francisco as usual
to-morrow.
TWO SUDDEN DEATHS.
Dr. Julius J. Robertson Found
Dead in Bed in His
Room.
Watchman of the Pet.r Donahu; Home
Died While Taking a Bath
in th â¢ Building;.
Dr. Julius J. Robertson was found dead
yesterday in his room at 213)4 Post street.
Deputy Coroner McCormick found the
bedciothin'g saturated with blood which
had issued from the lungs of the deceased.
An autopsy by Dr. Gallagher showed that
death bad been caused by pulmonary
hemorrhage.
The deceased had been employed on the
Pacific Mail steamship Acapulco and up
to a short time ago had been residing in
the Occidental Hotel. Among his cor
respondence was found a bill for $231 for'
board and wine with a request ior its
speedy settlement.
Dr. Robertson was a heavy drinker, and
on account of neglecting to settle the
score was requested to leave the hotel,
which he did, taking room 13 at 21334 Post
street ten days ago. From letters iound
in bis posession it was learned that his
Brother Henry is in the United States
Consulate at Hamburg, Germany, and
that the deceased had. requested him to
send $200 by wire as he, the deceased, was
sick. The reply by mail expressed a
a doubt as to the doctor's sickness and re
buked him for bis dissipation and extrav
agance, at the same time calling bis at
tention to the fact that ; only a short time
before that he had received $150 from his
lather B. H. Robertson, a real estate
agent at 1410 G street Northwest, Wash
ington, D. C. .
A letter from the Manhattan Life Insur
ance Company of New York, dated last
March, informed him that the company
declined to issue a policy on his life.
Bartholemew Ahem, watchman in the
unoccupied' Peter Donahue mansion on
the corner of Bryant and Second streets,
was found dead yesterday afternoon on
the floor of the bathroom.
Deputy . Coroner McCormick removed
the body to the Morgue, but there were
no indications that death was due to other
than natural causes. â¢ - r
The deceased was a native of Ireland,
aged 50 years. He was a single man and
has several brothers in this City.
The introduction of sugar into England
is often stated as having taken place in
the fifteenth century,' but it was really in
use in that country in the thirteenth cen
tury. . - V
MORE PENNY CLUB
MEMBERS MOURN
M. Rosenblum arid Wife
in Trouble With Two
- Such Bodies.
All Were Paid Off Last Week
at Twenty-Five Cents on
the Dollar.
One Man Wants to Whip Rosenb'nm.
Causes Assigned for the Sudden
Smashup.
Another penny purchasing club has
gone the way of all flesh and was safely
tucked into its coffin a week ago last
Monday. Many were the financial mourn
ers at the funeral, and now a wall of in
dignation is heard from 200 people living
round the bay whose pockets suffered
from connection with the hands of the
corpse before its untimely demise.
The name of the man who with the com
forting aid of his better half engineered
the club to its untimely destruction is M.
Rosen blnm, living at 807 a Geary street.
He seems, with the exception of a few
who were so fortunate as to draw lucky
numbers, to be about the only person
that is not sorrowful over the club's tak
ing off.
The formation of the club began last
September. At that time Rosenblum and
, wife passed around among their friends
and acquaintances soliciting â  members.
They were fortunate enough to secure
members enougn for two clubs, known as
club A and club B. Each contained 100
members and numbered peopie in Ala
meda County among its "subscribers." *'
Drawings were made regularly every
Saturday evening, but a - week from last
Monday the club was quietly dissolved,
and Rosenblum sent notices to the vari
ous members to call and present their re
ceipts. They did so and were paid off at
the rate of 25 cents on the dollar.
As a reason for the failure of the club,
Rosenblum told the members that it was
caused by so many withdrawing on ac
count of the exposures made of the meth
ods employed in running the penny club
of Mrs. Colin. He said he was sorry no
better payment could be made, as he was
desirous of running things fairly.
Many of the members who had failed to
receive notifications were present at his
house last Saturday evening, and a scene
in which anger and indignation played
leading parts was enacted. They desired
to know why Rosenblum had not secured
fresh recruits when the others withdrew,
but failed to receive a satisfactory re
sponse.
Among those who lost b7 the methods
employed in running the club are Mrs.
Stern of 2 Msrye terrace and her two sis
ters, Mrs. Simpson and Miss Gosland.
The amounts they paid in were about $12
apiece. This is said to be a fair average.
Mrs. Haacke, who lives on Hyde street,
near Ellis, was one of the lucky ones, and
j drew down $22 50 recently, but is said to
have paid in about $6 since that time.
When inquiry was made for Rosenblnm
at his home yesterday a lady came to the
aoor and said he was not in. Mrs. Rosen
blum was said to be ill in bed and unable
to see anyjone.
The lady stated, however, that Rosen
urn's dealings had been perfectly fair,
and that he was as sorry as anybody at
the untimely end of the club.
"OUR BOYS" TOR CHARITY.
Creditable Amateur Performance for the
Benefit of Trinity School.
The Trinity School Histrionic Society
gave a most creditable performance of the
standard comedy, "Our Boys," for the
benefit of the library fund of the school,
at the Bush-street Theater on Saturday
evening.
It is seldom that an amateur perform
ance moves so easily as did thin splendid
effort of theae young people, who were re
warded for the talent they displayed by
long continued applause from a crowded
auditorium.
Frank Math leu had charge of the affair
and he may well feel proud of bis young
pupils. Miss Hind and Miss Weldon It- nt
most gracefully and naturally the charms
of their own personality to the characters
assigned them. Miss Spaulding's "Aunt
Clarissa" was a very intelligent piece of
character work, as was also Mr. Ramsay
as the "Slave of the Ring." Mr. Hill as
Sir Geoffrey and Louis Starr as Middle
wich quite astonished their friends by
their venerable appearance and excellent
acting. "The Boys" were played by
Messrs. Melone and Kenyon, a couple of
handsome and gallant young fellows, in
vesting their respective characters with
ease and grace. Kempster and Boodles,
though small parts, showed the same care
ful preparation wh eh characterized the
whole cast, and Messrs. Hanna and Claude
Starr -serve the same hearty praise as
their fellows.
Removal of an Ugly Fence.
The fence in front of the new City Hall ro
tunda, which was an eyesore for months, has
at last been removed and the rotunda is daily
thronged with citizens who go there ior the
purpose of Inspecting the beautiful marble
wainscoting that is being put in. When com
pleted the rotunda will be one of the show

Brakes for Streetcara.
An exhibition of the Woodward streetcar
brake, which is expected to prevent many ac
cidents, will be given at the carhoute, corner
Turk and Fillmore streets, on Friday next at 3
p. m. The Board of Supervisors has been In
vited by tbe Market-street Company to be

LADIES RIDE IN
SMOKING-CARS
Attention of the Railroad
Commission Called to
the Matter.
Letter of Complaint Sent by a
Prominent Citizen of
Fresno.
Manager Fillmore States That Proper
Coaches Will Be Provided in
a Few Days.
When the Valley road put In its pas
senger rates to points in the San Joaquin
Valley the Southern Pacific in self-pro
tection established a second-class rate to
all points as far south as Fresno on its
San Joaquin Valley lines. These rates
were fixed so as to meet those of the com
peting line.
It also put on a special train to run
between this City and Fresno, and for the
convenience of second-class passengers a
second-class coach was attached to this
train. The second-class rates, however,
applied to all trains running through
Fresno, such as the Los Angeles and
Atlantic expresses, known as No. 17 and
No. 19 respectively when eastbound and
No. 18 and No. 20 when westbound. But
the accommodations on tbe through
trains are inferior to those on the Fresno
local, which is characterized as No. 39 and
No. 40. This was made clear to agents
when they were notified to sell second**
class tickets on such trains. Their in
structions were as follows:
To avoid any misunderstanding as to the
accommodations to be furnished on these
trains would nay that on Nob. 17 and 19 pas
sengers -will De allowed to occupy the smoker
and on No. 39 a local second-class coach.
Those on 17 and 19 desiring to go into the
second-class sleeping-car can do so on pay
ment of the usual Pullman rates.
This rule compels all who buy second
class tickets to points between this City
and Fresno, including ladles, to travel in
the smoking-cars on trains 17 or 19, unless
they pay the Pullman-car cnarges. As a
result there has been much dissatisfaction
and complaint on the part of tbe patrons
of these trains, and yesterday the matter
was called to the official attention of the
..Railroad Commission in the following
communication from a prominent citizen
of Fresno:
â â JlsJjy Fresno, May 3.
Hon. H. M. La Rueâ Sir: Was there not
an order passed by the .Railroad Commission
during the term of Stoneman, providing that
where the railroads gave second-class services
they must provide a car for second-class pas
sengers free from smoking ? If my memory
serves me right such is the case.
The Souther-n Pacific now assumes to give
second-clasi rates by all. trains through this
valley to compete with the Valley road, and
they put all the second-class passengers in the
smoking-car.
When the order was made, I believe I am
correct in saying that It was complied with at
once on the trains running from San Fran
cisco to Stockton, through Byron, where I
lived. If we have such rights and are entitled
to a car free from smoking, so that ladies can
avail themselves of it, will yon please see that
we are so provided, and oblige, yours truly,
y, y y? : . x y G. W. T. Carter.
Secretary Newman was instructed to
call the Southern Pacific's attention to
the matter by sending a copy of the letter'
to the company.
Manager J. A. Fillmore, when the sub
ject was mentioned to him by a Call re
porter, stated that the matter had been
underjconsideration by the company and
that records bad been kept of the number
of second-class passengers who travel on
trains 17 and 19. He added that it had
been virtually decided to put a second
class coach on 19 and 20, that is the east
bound and westbound Atlantic express
respectively, in a day or two.
ATTORNEY PIERSON ILL.
In Consequence the Fair-Craven
Trial Could Not Pro
ceed.
The Leading Counsel for tbe Executors
of the Estate Is Suffering From
Nervous Prostration.
There was no session of the Fair-Craven
trial yesterday because of the illness of W.
M. Pierson, the leading counsel for tbe
Fair executors.
The usual big crowd was on hand bright
and early, and the adjournment was quite
a disappointment.
Garret McEnerney announced tho in
disposition of his associate, and was ask
ing for a continuance when a messenger
arrived and banded him a physician's
certificate, which set forth that Mr. Pier
son was unfitted for work on account of
an attack of nervous prostration.
D. M. Delmas, leading counsel for the
defense, supgssted that, inasmuch as th*>
plaintiff bau a surplus of attorneys, tne
trial might proceed without Mr. Pierson.
Judge Slack was of a similar opinion.
- Mr. McEnerney insisted, however, that
it would be impossible to -Â»o on without
his associate, and the court finally granted
a continuance until this morning. The
announcement was made, though, that
the case would have to proceed at that
time whether Mr. Pierson was in attend
ance or not.
Has Hla Children Again.
C. A. Welch, formerly secretary of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Chil
dren, yesterday received a letter stating that
the three Vick children, whom he sent to their
father in Detroit, had arrived safely. The
three children are from 8 to 15 years of age.
Several months ago Mrs. Vick left her husband
and came to this City with another man,
bringing her children with her. These she
placed in several places. The father Bent to
the society to find his children, which was
done, and a week ago the little ones were sent
back to the father, who is rejoiced at their re
covery.

Ogden Will Be Reached in
Forty-Eight Hours From
Sacramento.
GCOD TIMES AHEAD FOE THE
GROWER.
â¢
Crops Promise to Be Plentiful, Mar
kets More Extended and
Prices Higher.
California fruit growers and shippers
have every reason to be in a happy mood
over the prospects of the coming season.
As already stated in the columns of The
â  Gall crops promise to be plentiful, and
the Eastern market, owing to damage
caused by frost in a number of States, will
be in excellent shape to promptly absorb
shipments of California green fruits at
good prices. !
On top of this comes the announcement
that the Southern Pacific Company has
made arrangements for special fast ser
vice for fruit trains into Chicago, New
Yolk and Boston, the principal distribu
ting centers in the East. Under tbe plan
proposed it will be possible to place the
shipments on the market one day earlier
than heretofore. This will present tbe
fruit in finer condition and materially en
hance its value.
. The season for shipping green fruits
East is about to open, being about two
weeks late, owing to the cool spring
weather. Cherries will be the first fruits
to be shipped in any quantity. They are
expected to come into the maricet in about
. two weeks. Apricots will follow shortly
after and then peaches.
There is every prospect that this year
there will be a splendid market for Cali
fornia fruits in the Atlantic States, be
cause ot the fact that heavy frosts nave
wiped out the greater part of the crops of
Georgia, Delaware and New Jersey, from
which States the large markets of the
Atlantic seaboard look for the larger part
oi their supply in normal years.
Those interested in the fruit production
of California â namely, the growers and
shippers on the one hand and the trans
portation companies . on the other â have
consequently been in necotiation for the
purpose of devising a plan making it pos
sible to reach the Atlantic seaboard mar
ket in the shortest time practicable, so
that on arrival there the irnits may bo in
first-class condition for distribution out of
Chicago, New York and Boston to ad
jacent cities and towns, as the demands of
the fruit trade require.
This has brought about something of a
new departure in the proposed handling
of trains of green fruit. The great volume
of tonnage will undoubtedly be moved in
refrigerator cars, the same as the last and
previous season.
Heretofore the refrigerators hare been
moved in regular freight trains, running
on customary freight schedules, the time
from Sacramento to Ogden being about
fifty-five hours.
. The Southern Pacific now contemplates
arranging a graded schedule from Sacra
mento to Osden, having for its purpose
the movement from Sacramento of fruit
thai may offer in trainioad quantities be
tween 6 p. M. and midnight during the
active season of fruit shipments, deliver
ing it at Ogden by midnight of the second
day. For example: A trainioad of fruit
leaving Sacramento at 6 p. m. would be
"delivered at Ogden in fifty- three hours,
arriving there at 11 p. m. of the second
day. If it left Sacramento at 10 p. m. it
would have to make tho run in forty-nine
hours in order to arrive at Ogden at 11
p. M. If, on the other hand, the train left
Sacramento at midnight, then forty-eight
hours must be mr.de to land it at Ogden at
midnight.
At Ogden the fruit for the different
routes will be segregated and given to the
Southern Pacific's immediate connec

Western. gUtilffl^^jg
Negotiations have been proceeding for
some time to bring about such a schedule
as would put California fruit in Omaha,
St. Paul, Chicago, St. Louis, New York
and Boston in time for early morning de
liveries.. Under the proposed schedule it
is the intention to put California fruit into
Chicago at 3 a. m., instead of as formerly
during the daytime. In the latter event
it would have to lie over for a market
until the next morning.
The Union Pacific has notified the
Southern Pacific th*Â« it would join in the
plan, and General Freight Agent Hahn of
the Rio Grande Western states that his
: company and connections will undertake
to do likewise.
This ii us far as the matter has pro
gressed so far, but shippers and growers
already state that this dan, if carried out,
will aid greatly the possibilities of Cali
fornia fruit distribution and give the In
dustry afresh stimulus.
CRUELTY AT SUA.
Mate of the Harry Morse Charged With
Clubbing a Sailor.
Andrew Anderson called on United
States Attorney Foote yesterday ana told
a narrowing story of cruelty on the high
seas. He was a seaman on the American
bark. Harry Morse, which arrived here
with a cargo of coal last Monday. Ander
son is a weak old man and naturally slow
in his movements. On March 7, while
doing some work on the vessel, Mate Pat
rick McNichols, annoyed at his slowness,
struck him on the. head with an iron
belaying-pin, cutting open the scalp and
felling him to the deck.
Anderson asked why he had been hit,
and McNichols, who seemed to become in
furiated because of the protest, replied,
with a vile expression, "I'll kill you be
fore you get to San Francisco."
A warrant was issued for McNichols*
arrest on a charge of cruelty.
DURRANT'S BILL SETTLED
His Exceptions to Judge Bahrs'
Rulings Will Go to the
Supreme Court.
Attorney Deuprey Insists That the
Ex cutioa Cannot Take Place
While an App?al Is P-.nd:_r.
Judge Bahrs yesterday settled the bill
of exceptions in the Durrant murder case,
being assisted in that work by Attorney
Eugene N. Deuprey, on behalf of the de
fendant, Theodore W. H. Durrant, and
District Attorney W. S. Barnes, who rep
resented the people.
The bill of exceptions just settled sets
forth that Durrant appeared before Judge
Bahrs on the 10th of last month, being
produced in court by the Sheriff, who was
ordered so to do. Then follows a report
of every act performed and every word
spoken until court was adjourned and
; Durrant was led out to be taken to San
Quentin. } '-f.yj'jJ-
At every step Mr. Deuprey interposed
: objections to the orders of the court, and
when the objections were overruled he re
corded an exception.
Nothing new was developed in yester
! day's session of the court. The steno
| eraphic report of the proceedings when
1 Durrant was sentenced by Judge "Bahrs
] proved satisfactory to all, and it will go to
i the Supreme Court under the approval of
! all parties concerned. /T -.',/:/ gs')
An irreconcilable difference of /opinion [
1 yet exists between Mr. Barnes on one side
1 and Mr.Deuprey on the other touching
the legal significance of this bill of excep
tions and the appeal with which it is re
lated. Mr. Barnes says the appeal will
; have no effect in regard to allowing a stay
!ol proceedings in the Durrant case. He
1 still holds that it will be the duty of War
den Hale to bang Durrant on the day set
, for the execution Dy Judge Bahrs unless
forbidden to do so by the Supreme Court.
On the other hand Mr. Deuprey insists
that Warden Hale would lay himself lia
ble to a char-re of murder if he should
hang Durrant while his appeal is pending
:in the Supreme Court. Tue fact that this
appeal is legally pending, Mr. Deuprey
urge?, implies that tne Supreme Court
may decide in Durrant's favor. If such a
' decision should be handed down after the
execution had taken place it would not be
a matter of gratification for either the ex
. ecutioner or the friends of Durrant. Mr.
', Deuprey is confident that Warden Hale
1 will not assume any such responsibility
I as is implied in the position taken by the
j attorney for the State.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 5, 1897.
NOW THE SEASON
FOR "GOOD THINGS"
Rienzi Was Uncorked at
the Juicy Odds of
50 to 1.
Game Old Morte Fonse Snatched
a Race From the Coals
by a Nose.

Heavily Backedâ Count of Flan*
ders a Likely Youngster.
Upsets, dumps and reversals in form
are of daily occurrence at the track these
days and the midnight oil can should be
corked up and put away in the cellar, the
dope book labeled and laid away on a
shelf and the educated money alone fol
lowed.
The attendance was good at Emeryville
yesterday. Mostly "good things" in the
betting wandered past the wire, the favor
ite scoring on but two occasions. Among
the "unloosenings" was the long-priced
loving acrobat Rienzi, which captured
the second event at oads of 50 and 60 to
1. Fannie S was another one unbottled,
leading her company out in the final race
decided at 30 to L : Jyy : -*
Game old Morte Fonse, which will soon
be entitled to the title of "iron horse,"
ran an exceptionally fine race in the mile
and a sixteenth, getting the decision from
Nebula and Manchester, the trio finishing
noses apart at the end. Aivarado, the 6
to 5 choice, led into the stretch, where he
began to "dog." Nebula then tooK com
mand, being joined by Manchester, and
the result looked to lie between them.
Tne last jump Bozeman brought Monte
Fonse up, snatching the purse by a nose
in 1:48} The winner was once aa good
as 20 to 1 in the ring.
Thirteen two-year-olds started in the
opening two-year-old scramble, with Za
pata, the Barns & Waterhouse entry,
going to the post at a 2 to 1 choice. De
-1 nial, a gelding carrying Ezell's colors,
[ proved the good thing, for backed down
I from 10 to 4 he soon showed first and won '
I very handily from Lord Marmion, an 8 to
i 1 shot. The favorite outfooted the first
j part, came through at the end and was
I given the show.
Barney Schreiber's half brother to Braw
! Scott, the cranky Greynusrt, was a pro
| nounce l 4 to 5 choice for the seven-furlong
i race that came next. He got away in the
i lead, but tired in the stretch, and was
j easily beaten out by Rienzi, ridden by
I Snider, against which 50 to 1 was laid in
I the books. George Palmer was a good
1 third. Sallie Clicquot, away from the post
I very poorly,. finished fourth.?;.,,'
Of the original twenty entries to the
! third event, a six-furlong selling scramble,
nine were scratched. Yemen then went out
I a 6 to 5 choice, and getting all the best of
j a straggling start led bis field ail the way,
j winning eased up from Mercutio, a 15
to 1 outsider. Road warmer, prominent
throughout, took the show. â â  â â j'jy
-The handsome little bit of horseflesh.
Count of Flanders, starting a 5 to 2, favor .
ite lor the second two-year-old spin at
four and a half furlong**,, won very im
pressively. Fiushington beat the barrier,
and showed the way as far as the paddock,
where his past numerous races told on,
i him, and he tired badly. Coming from
tbe rear tbe favorite slipped through next
th*** rail, and led Los Prieios past the
judges by three lem-ths in :55%.' Charles j
le Bel was a close third.
The final six-furlong selling sprint was :
captured by Fannie S, a 30 10 1 shot j
backed down to 20, which got up the last |
few yards and won by a nose from Alma, |

WINTHROP DONS STRIPES.
The Man "Who Held the Klch Hawaiian
Capitalist Is >'ow In Bondage
In San Ouentln.
Oliver C. Winthrop, who was convicted
and sentenced by Judge Wallace to life
imprisonment about one year ago, was re
moved to San Quentln yesterday.
Winthrop is the man who, with the
\ mysterious "Pete," took Millionaire
Campbell of Hawaii out to a cottage on
California street, and there held and tor
tured bim in the hope of compelling him
to pay bi- ransom for his life and liberty.
Previous to this occurrence Winthrop was
tried and acquitted for the poisoning of
Jennie Mathews, a woman whom be met
in Laurel Hill Cemetery while he was act
ing in the capacity of assistant superin
tendent.
After his conviction for the Campbell
crime his lawyer petitioned the Supreme
Court for a writ of probable cause, pend
ing an appeal and the settling of a bill of
exceptions before the trial Judge. On this
showing the higher court granted a ter- 1
porary restraining order on the Sheriff
not to remove Winthrop from the County
j Jail until the further order of the court.
In consequence of an ambiguity of the
j â  wording of the restraining order the pris
oner remained in the Broadway jail until
yesterday, whan Chief Jailer Satler noti
fied bim to get ready lor a trip across tbe
water to Marin County. At this notifica
tion Winthrop got saucy, and said there
was not power enough in the City to re
move him, as the Supreme Court bad
permitted him to remain until his case
should be decided by that tribunal.
In this, however, he was mistaken, as
he has since discovered, for he slept
within the same inclosure as Theodore
Durrant and some . hundreds of wicked
men last night, and this morning he will
appear in his new striped suit, which will
adorn his person for the balance of bis

*
HAD HOT INTENDED TO SPEAK
AT ALL.
His Words on SnurJay Night, H?
Says, Wer-s a Grievous
Mistake.
Tbe Brahmacharin has made the fol
lowing statement regarding bis words on
Saturday evening:
The recent unfortunate misunderstand
ing between the authorities of the
Woman's Congress and myself has cre
ated such a great sensation that it has
made me notorious, if not famous, all
over the City of San Francisco and there
abouts. While it remains a fact, most
solid and unalterable, that some of the
leaders of the congress in charge of the
platform, ana not the congress as a whole,
treated me most rudely, however they
may vainly deny it now vainly, because
it was so conspicuous that almost every
one in the audience saw it, as can be as
certained by any inquiring person, and
because they afterward spoke of it among
themselves, and some of them expressed
their regret for the rudeness to my friends,
though they never themselves apologized
to me â while this remains a fact I most
candidly admit that that never justified
what I did on the platform Saturday
evening. No â never. It would be un
justifiable in any person, to say nothing
of me, who have assumed such a great re
sponsibility as the teaching of a sublime
philosophy on myself.
It was strangely and most absurdly in
consistent with my position to express
myself the way I did. When I went to
the platform Saturday evening I never
thought of doing what I did. I went,
however, with the determination that I
should not speak before the' coneress any
more, but simply tell them why I should,
not speak, In a few words, calmly, peace
fully and in a friendly manner, and then
walk out. When, however, I stood up I
could not resist myself. As an advocate
of the grandest philosophy and religion,
which it has been my privilege to, devote
mysslf to. while yet a boy, I ought to
have adopted a different method entirely
and have remained away.
However, what is done is done. My
philosophy does not teach regret but reso
lution. Our motto is "Let the dead past
bury its dead." We resolve when we do
something wrong that we are not going to
do it again. Ido the same here. Accord
ing to the grandest teaching of my phil
osophy, let me repeat, I have no right to
find fault in others. And whether the au
thorities of the congress were right or
wrong that is a different question. I ad
mit for myself that tbe manner in which
I expressed myself was quite unbecoming
my position, and was due. 1 think, to the
sudden ascendency of the ungodly nature
in me nature which it is so difficult to
curb down even for the greatly advanced
sage, to say nothing of its strong power
in one who is still in the prime of youth.
I hope therefore tho puDlic will not find
fault with the philosophy I represent,
though most unworthily no doubt, any
more than they can blame the teachings
of the Christ because some of his followers
did most cruel deeds on earth. I also
hope that the ladles who have been
offended with me will have kindness on
reading this and thus will help me in
spiritual growth, for as long as I have a
single being, man or beast, unfriendly to
me I cannot reach the' goal which my
philosophy holds out before me. I am a
young man, a son of the world, and the
ladies are mothers.

MBS- EEDHELD WAS SANE.
The Supreme Court Hold* That the
Woman's Will Was Valid.
The State Supreme Court yesterday up-
Bet the decision of the Superior Court of
this City in the contest of the estate of
Mrs. Mary A. Redfield, who died on Octo
ber 4, 1891. S.ie left an estate valued at
about $73,000. '"'"O; 'â¢â¢
Three weeks before her death she made
a will in which she made provision for
relatives in small amounts. She also Dro
vided for her aged mother, so that the
latter should have $80 a month as long us
she lived. Under ihe will the adminis
trator was to set aside sufficient property
to insure the amount to the old woman.
The remainder was bequeathed to Walter
A. Johnson, a favorite nephew of Mrs.
lied field. .
The old mother and several relatives
who ban received small remembrances by
Mrs. Redtield contested the will in the
Superior Court, and that, tribunal de
cided that Mrs. Redfield was of unsound
mind when she made the will. The Su
preme Court reversed this decision and
ordered that the cause bs tried again. It
held that the evidence showed that Mrs.
Redfield was not of unsound mind, al
though she did show a preference for her
nephew Johnson. In discussing the case
the Supreme Court pointed out the fact
that Mr. Redfield died in 1881, leaving an
estate of about $35,000, of which Mrs. Red
field was the administratrix. She was of
such sound mind and good business judg
ment that in ten years she made this sum
double what it was. She was penurious in
the extreme and always more or less ec
centric, but never insane, nor was she ac
cased while living of being insane or of
unsound mind. â --â â â -â â '
Barnes Was a Little Lata.
D. 11. Barnes pleaded guilty yesterday be
fore United State District Judge Morrow to a
charge of smuggling two boxes of opium. He
was ordered to appear for sentence next Sat
urday morning at 9 o'clock and was commit
ted to the custody of the Marshal to await his
sentence. The offense was committed in
1894, but the matter has been staved off until
the present time. It is not likely that ne will
receive any further continuances.

THE LEGION OF HONOR
Changes in the Method of Assess
ments Cause a D crease
o Members.
The Explanation Made by Granl Com
' mander Fi b*-_~- The Grand Sec
retary's Confiiencj.
The first session of the annual conven
tion of the American Legion of Honor was
held yesterday morning in B'ne B'rith Hal.
There were present a full representation of
the delegates and the following-named
grand officers: .*
Grand commander, Thomas Filben ; orator
Frank Ey; past grand commander,
; grand secretary, C. O. Burton; grand
treasurer, W.H.Hamilton; grand chaplain,
Rev. b. O. Kelley; grand guide, Mary C. Sny
der; grand warder. Mary A. Michell; grand
sentry. Almena If. Moser; grand trustees, Wil
liam Metzner, A. U. Oummings.
Prayer was offered by Grand Chaplain
Rev. D.O. Kelley, after which the roll of
representatives was called and the new
members were admitted and instructed by
the grand commander. ,Â«â,"- 7-** T.T;- **>*-- > y[-
A letter was read from Grand Vice Com
mander Willman expressing his inability
to be present.
The reports of the grand commander,
grand secretary and grand treasurer and
of the supreme representatives were pre
sented and referred to a committee on de
liberation composed of Representatives
K. J. Wiliats, W. H. J. Bishop and J. M.
Henderson. -â - '-jJj r JA
The grand commander in his report
says: /'â *'â 
From causes well understood we shall have
to 'report: a considerable fulling, off in the
membership of the order. However, no such
falling off has been reported in other juris
dictions. I consider this is due to the close
touch that has been maintained wltn the lead
ing councils and the personal touch of the
grand officers with the membership of the
larger ol them. *â  '
Comparatively considered, at least, trie
State of the order is occasion for gratitude.
We have lost membership, but our situation
iv this is not singular, and I mistake not if
the signs oi promise are not evident and en
couraging. ââ,.â¢â¢ ,_
' Class A reported about 5000 members on
April 1, and . this number has been consider
ably increased by this time. The greater part
of the membership will be enrolled in this
class by Ju.y *1.. The membership transfers
easily as it comes to understand all the case,
and confidence is taking the place of any ques
tions of the past, and there is large hope of an
early increase of numbers.
The Supreme Council announces Us purpose
to face the question of extension vigorously.
It proposes to cover unoccupied territory
everywhere, and with the present movement
of cess in fraternal insurance, our reason
able share of the business will put us on win
ning (-round, by turning the tables again. I
confidently expect a general growth. in. the
near future. ,
Grand Secretary Burton in his reports
gives many interesting facts and figures,
light councils having fallen below the
constitutional limit were dissolved and the
members remaining were transferred to
other councils. '-
, The following figures give the state of
the membership:
""Membership, June 30, 1896, 2343; increase
by Initiations 3, by transfers 56, reinstate- ,
ments 25 (total. 84); grand total, 2427. De
c-case, by suspension* 464, transfers 54, with
drawals "4, deaths 34 (total. 556); making a
membership on December 31. 1806, of 1871. .
Several resolution" of instruction were
referred Â»*** a committee consisting of
Judge J. H. Sea well, William Henderson.
William Bradley, Anna Garden and K. S.
Stephenson. "
At tne evening session the report of the
supreme representatives was considered
and adopted.
To-day officers will be elected ana, after
the installation, the Grand Council will
adjourn.

- Escape of Two Burglars.
Two burglars yesterday afternoon went to
the third floor of Mr-. Clark's lodging-house at
502 Washington street and made a tour of
inspection of all ihe rooms on that floor.
They made up several paikiges of clothing,
jewelry and other articles, but were detected
by the landlady before they left the house.
She screamed ior the police and the thieves,
dropping the plunder, dashed across the
street into a fruitstore, expecting thai it whs
a part of the Washington rnnrket and that
they could gel through to Merchant street.
But the store was a blind alley and tney ran
out again. By that time a crowd had Slithered
and the thieves darted into tne market with
the crowd in full cry behind them, but when
Merchant street was reached they had disap
peared. *

Divorces were granted in the Superior Court
yesterday, as follows:
Jephtha Cooper from Mary E. Cooper, for

Tells Her Experience With
Ovaritis.
A dull, throbbing pain, accompanied
by a sense of tenderness and heat low
down in the side, with an occasional
shooting pain, indicates inflammation.
On examination it will be found that
the region of pain shows some swelling.
This is the first stage of ovaritis, in-
flammation of the ovary. If the roof of
your house leaks, my sister, you have
it fixed at once ; why not pay the same '
respect to your own body ?
Do you live miles away from a doc-
tor? Then that is . jQtij

ills is greater than any other living per-

â¢â¢ For nine years I suffered with fe-
male weakness in its worst form. I
was in bed nearly a year with conges-

headaches as to make me almost wild.
Was also troubled with leucorrhoea,
and was bloated so badly that some
thought had dropsy. I have taken
several bottles of Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound, and several of
her Blood Purifier, and am completely
cured. It is a wonder to all that I got
well. - I shall > always owe Mrs. Pink-
ham a debt of gratitude for her kind-
ness. I would advise all who suffer
to take her medicine."â Mbs. A.\'.ni*

THE WINE TRADE.
The Pacific Wine and Spirit Review says of Cali
fornia wines: There is little to be said regarding
the situation. Considering the general business
conditions the March exports were of good volume,
as shown by the accompanying figures. In fact,
they were better than could have been expected.
Rail shipments, in particular, show up In a fairly
satisfactory manner, the total of ra 1 movements
being nearly 800,000 gallons, with nearly 3000
cises.
The distribution was ceneral and looks well. It
Is only in recent limes that New Orleans has paid
any attention to our belter grades of wines, es
pecially in g.ass. While maintaining her big de
mand for bulk goods, she is developing a healthy
trade In case goods, as shown by the fact that In
March the shipments to that city were nearly 700
cases, a I 01 which is a comfortable status. At
this rate it will not be long ere that city will de
velop into cue of our best "customers in that line.
THE LUMBER TRADE.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says: And still the
lumber trade is flat. To hear manufacturers talk
one is reminded of the boys who whistle as they
pass through a graveyard. They all claim that
1 .is are stiffening, but when estimates are re
quired prices fall far below remunerative rates,
considerable lumber is coming in and building is
quite active, but the supply far exceeds the de
mand and mam- varus ar- selling email lots at
cargo prices. Most of the mills of Mendocino
nre lunning full on orders, but in Humboldt little
besides foreign orders are being attended to. There
Is some inquiry from the last for redwood and
shingles.acd 11 looks as though the Eastern market
was beginning to appreciate the superiority of red
wood for building purposes.
I
Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top flguj-rt
I station indicate maximum temperature for the
Hays: those underneath It. if any. the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid]
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hlch" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low
refers to low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south atom? the coast, rain Is probable:
but when the "low Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer arid colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
Will produce an opposite result.

The Virginia Enterprise says: It is a well-known
fact here that the great bonanzas, which enabled
the Consolidated Virginia mine in years gone by
to pay millions of dollar, in dividends, ail existed
between the 1200 and 1650 levels, and as a usual
thing they were all found to peter out on the 1650
level. The present discovery has every appear
ance of being one of the old-time chimneys of ore,
such as those which contained thousands of. tons.
The new ore oody is in practically virgin ground.
Should It extend toward the south there is un
limited room ior it, and there is over 200 feet
overhead before any old workings will be encoun
tered. All mining experts who have visited the
new bonanza say that it has every appearance of
permanency. . .

A HEALTH BOARD
Or. Brinckerhcff Resigns,
as He Will Not Sup
port a Programme.
Mayer Thomas Disc aims Ex
acting a Premise From
Any Appointee.
Or. Rucker Tells Another Vi w and
an Attempt Will Ec Made to
Meet To Morrow.
Oakland Offcie San Francisco Call, I
DOS Broadway. May 4. )
" The affairs of the Board of Health are
more muddled than ever. The meeting
called for to-day did not come off, and to
add to the complications Dr. Brinckerhcff
has resigned.
Dr. Rucker, another appointee of Mayor j
Thomas, declares he has not resigned, I
but that he will have to vote for ousting ;
the present ot-cials if'he remains on the
board.
'I am free to say," he said, "that I ac
cepted the position on the board with the \
understanding that I would appoint the I
men named by Mayor Thomas. As I un- I
derstood it, it was a prerogative of the
Mayor to make the necessary changes to |
surround himself with men who would â 
work with him. With this view I agreed '
to favor appointing men to office under >
the board in accordance with the Mayor's |
wishes."
.Dr. Brir.c_erhoff has had a hard time ;
during the two days tie has been a mem- |
ber of the Board of Health. Last night j
on account of bis alleged part in the pro
gramme, he was approached by several of
the trustees of the First Presbyterian
Church, ol which he is a member, and
told that such business was unbecoming a
member o; the medical pro:- on. As
Dr. Brinckerh.df enjoys a lucrative prac
tice he evidently did not wish lor the sake
of doing some politics to anla-:oniZ3 his
friends, and to-duy he washed his hands
of the whole business.
Mayor Thomas declares he has pledged
no one, and that he merely made the ap
pointments on the board, leaving them
perfectly free to fill the offices under them
as they saw fit.
"This business of making appointments
is not in my hands," said the Mayor. "It
rests entirely with the Board oi Health.
I had no quarrel with Dr. Small before he
resigned, and if other members wiih to
resign I shall name their successors, but
shall not attempt to tie them tip regard
ing patronage. The statement that I have
been actuated in my appointments in the
interest of any water company is false, as
such a thing lias never baen mentioned,
and such an idea has never entered my
head. I have not appointed the Board of
Health for any other purpose than to do
their duty."
There i- a plank in the Republican plat
form which declares that Repunlican offi
cials should not be disturbed so long as j
they did their duty. But the Board of
Health within a few hours of being ap- I
pointed star ed in to break this plank all
to pieces. They removed every official j
except Sanitary Inspector Smith, without :
a word or complaint or a minute's notice j
as tj their intention, ana not only re
moved Dr. Pierce, the veterinary surgeon,
who is an ardent and enthusiastic Repub- !
lican, but appointed in his place Dr.
btimson, who is an ardent and enthusias- |
tic Democratic- Populist,
According to Dr. Rucker, the responsi
bility for these changes rests with the '
Mayor, and according 10 the Mayor it was
rely the work of the doctors, and be
tween the statements of the two there is a j
dire discrepancy.

OAKLAND, Cal., May 4â Rev. Alfred

sponded with a good voice, especially to
the question, "I renounce the devil and
all his works."

was sprinkled with water. Mrs. Mont
gomery, tbe pastor's assistant, closed the
proceedings with prayer. The boy was

nyarants between the two water companies

the Town Trustees placed a drinking-
f ov> n tain in the plaza Saturday. Many

washed the dust from their parched lips

fountain in existence on the road to San
Joe, but man; more are pr< mised by the
Christian Endeavor societies of this
county.

j the trees are almost without a cherry.
| while the next row is welt filed, and,
j again, one side of a tree will be well filled,
: while the other half has been completely
j stripped. This is owing to the hot winds
blowing in currents.

Next week the Tabernacle will resound
with the barks of all kinds of dogs. The
third annual bench show will open with
an unusually large amount of entries, and
as the doggies nave numerous friends in

usually attractive.
Already the list of entries exceeds 390.
and they are still coming in by mail. Al
DR. C O. HAMLIN Will Exhibit a Kennel Containing Three Pug
Pups, a Kitten and a Cat. The Pops Were in Need of a
Parent and They Were Substituted for Kittens and the Cat

Among the rare breeds are some animals
of the Barzois class, bred by Grand Duke
Nicholas of Russia, and owned and en
tered by E. Pelrio Hoyle of Orange
County. They stand quite as high as
! ordinary greyhounds, have shaggy coats
of white and brown color and are pecu
liarly handsome dons.
A. L. Kennedy of this city will exhibit
a dog that will attract more than ordinary
attention. It is an Esquimaux dog
brought from the Arctic regions by Lieu

Archbishop Riordan Addresses
the Students at St. Mary's
College.
C lebrat-d the Feast cf the Founder

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 4. j
Archbishop Riordan presided to-day at
the feast of John the Baptist de la Salle,
founder of the Order of Christian Biothers,
at St. Mary's College. A number of stu
dents were confirmed by the Archbishop
at the same time.
Solemn high mass was celebrated a t the
college chapel at 10 o'clock by Rev. Father
Scanlan of Temescal, assisted by Fathers
Cull, Butler and St. Francis de Sales.
Rev. Fathers Sullivan and Clark were
deacons of honor to the Archbishop. Rev.
Father Cromwell was master of ceremo
nies, and the assistants were Rev. Fathers
Connolly, Harrington, O. P. Brown, Kins*,
Hickie, S. J. Rousselon, S. M. ; Very Rev.
Father Frieden, 8. J., and Rev. Father
McSweeny. y'AAW
Alter tbe mass Archbishop Riordan ad
ministered the rite of confirmation and
spoke in part as follows:
My dear boys, the Apostle Paul, in his let
ter o the Hebrews, says: "We should, there
fore, observe these thing!* diligently which we '<
have heard lest they Blip." He who wrote that
well knew the human heart. He knew that only
gradually does It fall away. This la the his
tory of every soulâ drifts away slowly by de
grees down the streams of pÂ»ssl n and of sin
out on the ocean ot crime and infidelity. Ob
serve the ships, bow they are fastened by two
anchors, one at the stern and one at the bow,
for tne tides are strong.
We must have two anchorsâ the anchors of
insttuctive intelligence and of confirmed and
sacrlfic-ni* faith. The one will not do without
the other. Harken now to these things which
you have heard in youth, and in afterlife
there Will be no danger.
First comes instructive intelligence, for we
must stud- our religion. The Master said:
"Be ye teachers," and "Go and teach them
what ye have heard." The apostles were first
teachers. And a* for the second anchor,
"Faith is the root and foundation of all re
ligion."
The knowledge of your religion must come
first in your spiritual life, in order that you
may understand it and appreciate its beau ties.
But religious study should not be haphazaid,
but BVfite:nat:cally carried on day by day. Our
intelligence must guide us to a higher life.
What you will be in after life as men and
Christians will depend upon your ro.igous
training in youth; nor should tne observance
of your religion be relegated to one .lav in ihe
week or one hour of the day. Your religious
life must be closely interwoven with your
secular life.
You may say th** danger* are not many. But
gradually poison may enter the mind. First
one evil thought Cfjmes, then another, till the
strength of the Intellect- is shattered and the
spiritual temple within undermined. Grad
aully we feel the changes.' We' grow
what the w* rid calls broad minded. We
have no right to grow liberal with what is
not ours. Divine truths were given us by
God through the Nfzarene. lie must find
them as he left them. The moment we tamper
with it, it goes rora us. Therefore I want to
impress upon yon particularly to pay close at
tention to your religious instruction in col
lege. Religion forms the character, secular
knowledge does not
The second anchor is faith. More people go out
of the church, not been use they are not tiling
to believe, but because the obligations of heir
faith are disagreeable to them. If you neglect
holy mass on Sunday it causes a break In your
religious lite. We lose more by moral delin
quencies. Therefore, my children, it will not
no ior you merely to know your religionâ you
must also live it. It will not do for you to
have mere instructive Iniellig'-nc* ; you must
have also a confirmed and sacrificing faith. It
is not the soldier who noes patriotic talking,
but the soldier who do patriotic deeds who
is going to benefit his country. I say to you,
love your church, uphold its dignity, defend
i:, deny it never.
In ihe afternoon an elaborate feast was
served in the banquet-rooms of the col-
lege, which had been decorated with ar
ti-lic skill for the occasion. Brother Wal
ter, the president of the college, presided.
The Archbishop, the priests, numbering
fifty, and the brothers present at the morn
ing mass participated in the banquet.

Hut Few ''Exes."
BERKELEY, Cal., May 4.â A strong
tendency to work the complete or almost
complete abolition of examinations at the
State University has manifested itself
during the period of "exes" now at its
height. More students in proportion to
the size of the classes have been excused
from the "exes" this term than at any
other period in the history of the institu
tion. By resolution of the Academic Sen
ate,' recently passed, all professors and in
structors were empowered to excuse from
examinations whatever students they saw
fit. As a consequence the bulletin-boards
of the various departments have been
crowded with lists of student excuses, all
who have maintained a high record dur
ing the term being allowed to pass with
out being suffered to und-rgo the final
test. Those who have been required to
take the "exes," on the other hand, find
them unusually difficult. .

FATAL EFFECT OF
BAD LEMONADE
Little Emelia Kilssling Ex
pires at Danville in
Great Agony.
i
EigLite3D Young Children Drank
of the Beverage From a
Metal Bucket.
The Acid Corroded the Zinc and
Created a Deadly Poison, Producing
S-vere Sickness
Oakland Offict. San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 4. J
Emelia Kilssling died at Danville to-day
after . suffering great torture for many
hours from drinking poisoned lemonade.
The circumstances attending the death
of little Einelia, who is but 8 years of age,
is very distressing, but the cause of her
death is eatily accounted for. Last night
the Indies of the local Rebecca Lodge gave
a social, and when it adjourned it was
found that there was a quantity of lemon
ade left over. It was placed in a tin bucket
and left over night, and given to the school
children in the morning.
The little people drank the lemonade
very freely, and altogether eighteen
scholars at the public school are now very
sick. Soon after drinking the poisoned
lemonade they were attack d with con
vulsions and suffered great pain. Some
of them were relieved by vomiting, and
this probably saved their lives. But others
were subject to violent spasms, and could
do nothing to aid themselves.
Physicians were called in and the little
people were rented with heroic remedies;
but Emelia Kilsslini.-,who was a frail little
girl, did not recover from the shock and
died to-day.
An examination of the dregs in the
bucket showed that the acid of the lemon
ade had acted with the zinc lining to pro
duce a violent poison.
it is not thought that any of t'-e other
children will succumb to their sickness, as
in most cases the danger point had been
passed. In cases of lead poisoning, how
ever, there aro frequently after effects
which cannot be guarded against, and it
is possible that the affair may end yet
more senoudy than is anticipated.

LAUNLKI ORDINANCE.
A Queer Occurrence Before the Board
of Trustees.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 4.â At a meet
ing of the board of Trustees last night the
laundry ordinance came up for discussion,
or raider what was supposed to be the
amended ordinance governing. such insti
tution .-. After it had been discussed for
some time it was suddenly announced
that the ordinance was not properly be
fore ihe board, never having been legally
introduced. The ordinance was there
upon at once offered by one of the Trus
tees, and was referred to the proper com
mittee. Substquent investigation, how
ever, showed mat the whole proceeding
was incorrect, as the ordinance baa ac
. tually been introduced according to law.
The City Teaming.
ALAMEDA. Cal. May 4.â The Trustees
are always on the alert to reduce the city's
expense-) whenever possible, and a good
opportunity has arisen which will be
tan n advantage of. Heretofore the city
has kept a team and driver for the pur
pose of doing the drayine and hauling,
which in the course ot a month amounts
to a great deal, while the expense i** also
considerable. At a meeting of the Trus
tees last night J. D. Fletcher offered to
furnish a team and do all the worn for $90
a month. Gottlieb Schumacher thereupon
offered to do the work for $80, and the
Trustees seeing the opportunity for a good
saving immediately ordered that bids be
called for to do the work.
The Tidal Canal. .
ALAMEDA, Cal., May The sharp
and prompt comment of the papers on
the nuisance created in the tidal canal by
the poisoning of fish from the dumping of
refuse into, the estuary by the tanneries
on the Oakland shore produced prompt
results, as the practice was discontinued
as soon as the press took it up, together
with the health authorities of this city.
The communicati not Health Officer Mc-
Lean to the State Fish Commissioners was
replied to to the effect that the remedy
lay with the Health boards of the two
cities, but that if there were any further
wholesale destruction of fish the Commis
sioners would loon into the matter.
Concussion of the Brain.
ALAMEDA. Cal., May 4.â C. J. Scbult
hets-t. 26 years of age and residing at 1419
Ninth street in this city, died last nigtn
from concussion of the brain, the result of
a severe fall at the store of Miller, Sloss &
Scott, San Francisco, where he was em
ployed. He was at work arranging some
goods on one of the floor decks, when he
lost his foothold and fell to the gtound
floor, sustaining injuries that proved
fatal. He leaves a widow and child.
Fire In Berkeley.
BERKELEY. Cal., May 4.â A big blaze
occurred at West Berkeley this evening,
when Henry W. Taylor's barn, contain
ing about 500 bales of bay, was totally de

burned. The total damage amounts to
about $5000. Crossed electric wires are
thought to have caused the fire.
ALL ABOUT WILD GAME.
The Cordelia Shooting Club Met With
a Disappointment Yesterday
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
held a large and enthusiastic meeting last
evening in K. of R. B. Hall.
President Ahem reported that he had
received word from Judge Muraskey, who
is one of the attorneys for the associa
tion; that the case of Charles W. Kellogg,
who Is president of the Cordelia Duck
Shooting Club, against certain represent
atives of the association, wno had been
accused of trespassing on the plaintiff's
preserve in the Suisun marshes, came up
yesterday in Fairrield for rehearing before
Judge Buckles of Solano County, and
that, as the plaintiff's counsel did not
have any witnesses present, the Judge
granted him a postponement of the case
until such time as witnesses can be se
cured.
Mr. Kellogg was questioned by Judge
Muraskey, but he failed to remember
haviuc seen any of the men who were
accused of trespass shooting over the
club's demesne at any time. The Cor
delia Club members state that their legal
battles and the expenses attached to the
hiring of keepers, etc., amount to thou
sands of dollars, which outlay makes
duck-shooting on the Suisun marshes
a rather expensive luxury for the lessees
of shooting preserves.
The Protective Association is making

Edward J. Livernash Lsts Out the
Truth of the Inside Gyrations of
People's Home Savings Bank.
The skeleton at the feast has been un
covered at last, much to the discomfort
of those that reveled at the pie counter of
the People's Home Savings Bank, and
gorged on the assets of that institution.
Not the least of the worried is Superior
Judge J. C. B. Hebbard, who these days
is devoting his attention, at the expense
of the connty, to an endeavor to convict
Editor Marriott of the News Letter of
libel, for daring to trespass upon the dig
nity that hedges a candidate for office by
expressing an opinion that Hebbard was
the "tool" of the men who looted the
wrecked bank.
The man who opened the coffin to let
the ghoul see the light was Edward J.
Livernash, now assistant managing editor
of the Examiner. Livernash is an attor
ney as well, and at the time of the failure
of the savings bank was tha legal adviser
of R. H. McDonald jr., one of the board
of directors. On the witness-stand he
narrated a chapter in the inside affairs of
the bank that lias never been printed of
the main] illations of the man whom
Judge Hebbard appointed as receiver to
retain himself in office, in spite of the pro
test of the depositors and board of direc
tors.
It was a story in financial jugglingâ
possible only through the inaction of a
court â and when it was told there was
such consternation among Judge Hebbard
and. bis attorneys that they refused to go
on with the cross-examination until they
had consulted in private.^ In consequence,
Livernash will appear "again this after
noon for this ordeal.
Livernash's story was not embellished.
When the bank failed four of the board of
J directorsâ George Schultz, George P.
Keeney, R. H. McDonal-i and A. L. Jen
kins â expressed their willingness to re
sign, in order that the depositors might
select officers of their own choice.
McDonald, Sennit- and KeÂ»>ney prompt
ly placed the written resignations in
Livernash's hands, while Attorney Henry
E. Hightou held a similar document from
Jenkins.
"They were willing to resign whenever
the time should arrive."
"What do you mean by that?" asked
Attorney Shortridge.
"Wr.enever Judge Hebbard should mod
ify his injunction so a to allow them to
step out."
"Did they keep their wishes to resign a
secret?"
"On the contrary, they gave it the
widest t Ã¼bltcity. It was communicated,
also, to the depositors' committee.'
Jud<*e Hebbard was of course apprised
of the wishes of the directors, but that
official was deaf to all entreaty.
"Do you know if Receiver Sbeehan
frustrated or opposed the wishes of the
depositors?"
"I know he did," added Livernash.
"Both he and Attorney James Alva Watt
opposed every effort of the depositors to
get control of the bank."
McDonald, in order to influence public
opinion in the criminal actions pending
against him, subsequent to the failure of
the Pacific Bank, decided to sever all con
nection with the savings bank.
Mr. McDonald, in all, held about 700
shares of the stock of the People's Home,
and decided to turn this over to Livernash
for the benefit of the stockholders. Of
this stock 240 shares were in McDonald's
possession, which de promptly indorsed
and turned over to his attorney. The re
mainder wis divided between H. I. Wil

The interest of his brother Frank, about
600 shares, the banker deeded to Liver
nash by virtue of a power of attorney
which he held.
When the annual election of officers
rolled around in January, 1805, Livernash
made preparations to vote his stock ac
cording to the wish of the depositors.
Ten days before the election he called at
tbe hank, and duly presenting a block of
the McDonald stock, asked for a certificate
of reissue.
"Sheehan looked about when 1 made my
request,'' continued Liverna-h, "and after
some hesitation informed me there was
an attachment against the stock issued by
one of McDonald's creditors. 'What's
The Protest of the Depositors of the People's Home
Savings Bank Against John F. Sheehan's
Misconduct as Receiver Which Judge
Hebbard Allowed to Pass
Unnoticed.
WHEREAS, John F. Sheehan has been appointed receiver of the
People's Home Savings Bank ; and
WHEREAS, The duties of said receiver are to act as the mere cus
todian of the bank's property and to be impartial in all respects ; and
WHEREAS, The said Sheehan has caused publications to be made
reflecting upon the honesty of this movement and also belittling the
value of the bank's property with the result that some of the depos- ,
itors were thereby influenced to sell their books at a sacrifice ; and
WHEREAS, The said Sheehan has caused communications to be
issued requesting depositors to call at the bank for the purpose of sign
ing a roll, the object of which is his retention in charge of the bank's
property ; and
WHEREAS, The said Sheehan has permitted the books of the bank
to be used for this purpose and letters have been sent to the depositors,
whose names and addresses could only have been obtained therefrom,
and has been partisan in refusing to allow us, the depositors, the same
privilege, and has denied us access to the bank to obtain signatures to
the roll of depositors ; and
WHEREAS, Our sole aim is to secure an honest and economical
liquidation of the bank's affairs ; and
WHEREAS, The said Sheehan has used every effort to break up our
organization, all with the object of retaining a position in the bank
against the interests of the depositors; and \ r;.,
WHEREAS, We believe him to be one of the causes of the cease
less delays to the reorganization of the present board of directors ;
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the said John F. Sheehan, by his acts, has proven
himself unworthy of our confidence and an unfit person to be receiver
of the People's Home Savings Bank, and we therefore respectfully re
quest the Judge of the Superior Court, who appointed ' him, to imme
diately remove him from his position ; and, be it further
Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be immediately delivered
to J. C. B. Hebbard, Judge of the Superior Court of the City and
County of San Francisco, State of California.
THE DEPOSITORS OF THE PEOPLE'S HOME SAVINGS BANK IN MASS
MEETING ASSEMBLED.
to you?' I asked. 'You know, Mr.
Sheehan. that the attachment follows the
stock.' Sheehan told me to come back in
a couple of hours."
When Livernash returned, he found a
condition of affairs be had not antici
pated. Sheehan had communicated with
bis attorney, J. A. Watt, and the latter
had at once caused an execution to be
issued on Livernash's stock. This of
course tied the lawyer's hands. Similar
tactics were adopted with the remainder
of the stock held by Livernash. Sheehan
refused to recognize the blll-of-sale
transactions. Watt instituted attach
ment proceedings against Frank Mc-
Donald's interest, and when election day
rolled around he and Sheehan saw to it
tbat a board of directors was elected of
their own choice. *
"That is the history," said Livernash.
"how the depositors failed to vote ,1300
shares of stock at that meeting â enough
to have given them control of the bank.
"But that was not all. Sheehan played
his game well. Mrs. Matt.ie Rickard", a
sister-in-law of Dick McDonald, con
trolled 650 shares of the stock, and this
she was about to transfer to Livernash for
the benefit of the depositors, but Watt's
ingenuity frustrated this. He paid Mrs.
Rickard $500 for her stock the night before
the election and it went to swell the Shee
han pool."
Livernash's recital acted like a bomb in
tbe Hebbard camp. Attorney Kahn iiu
diately made a piteous plea for time. He
was not ready to proceed with cross-ex
amination until he had consulted with
Mr. Sheehan. 'yhyyyyyy.
"This is all new matter to us," said
Kahn, and the crowded courtroom smiled.
"We never knew of it before. Judge Heb
bard never heard this before. We want to
have a tali** with Mr. Sheehan," and Kahn
began to protest hysterically.
Judge Daingerfield asked if the Sheehan-
Watt manipulation-* were going to be con
nected with Judge Hebbard.
"Yes," answered Attorney Shortridge;
"we are going to connect him with bad
men." " '
"Can you prove that?" again queried
the court.
"That's for the jury," was the reply,
and turning to Kahn Attorney Shortridge
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 5, 1897.
Some Side Lights in the Marriott
Libel Case*
said: "Go on with the cross-examina
tion." .:'*.; *:-'
"We don't know how," said Kahn, be
seechingly. "We must wait until we see
Mr. Sheehan." *
Kahn continued in this vein. He was
indignant and tearful by turns. A dozen
times he rushed excitedly to Judge Heb
bard for advice, but the client seemed al
most as much disconcerted aa the lawyer.
JudtreDaingerheld decided to give them
time to recover their scattered senses, and
Livernash's cross-examination was post
poned.
The morning session was devoted to a
recital by T. H. McCarthy, chairman of
the depositors' committee, of Sheehan's
efforts to "hear" the assets of the bank
during tis receivership. |This wis of
course but paving the way for the intro
duction by Attorney Shortridge of the
resolutions adopted by the depositors in
June, 1894, condemning Sheehan's receiv
ership and asking Judge Hebbard to
remove him.
-- -â  - â --â  â -;- --.-â -
I McCarthy declared that Sheehifh had
caused statements and interviews to be
published undervaluing the bank's assets.
He recalled that a tract of 16.000 acres on
the Carissa plains was declared by Shee
han 10 be not worth over $50,000. A capi
talist had offered, but a few days before,
$120,000 for the same property. The land
generally was worth from $8 to $10 per
acre. Sh*>ehan had also attempted to
"bear" the price of the stock of the Los
Angeles Electric Railway.
"Your complaint was that these under
valuations tended to cause the depositors
to sell their bankbooks at a big discount?"
asked Attorney Shortridge.
Kahn was strenuously opposed' to Pike
answering this pointed question.
"It is asserted," continued Mr. Short
ridge, "that he undervalued this property
to the end that the depositor* might come
in and sell their bankbooks at a sacri
fice --yy *â¢â 
Judge Daingerfield could not see that
such an action tended to reduce the funds
of the bank.
"We simply wish to show," continued
Mr. Shortridge, "that Sheehan sneaked
out as best he could; that he was a bitter
partisan; that be went through the as
sets of the bank like a Bashi-Bazouk and
we wish also to show that Judge Hebbard
knew of it."
" The fact that Sheehan had sent out cir
culars to the depositors for tbe purpose of
securing signatures to a roll to retain him
in office was a tender spot for the Heb
bard regime. The depositors' committee
then made an effort 10 interview tue de
positors in their own behalf, with a view
to having them sign another roil. The
committee proposed to take seats inside
the doors of the bank, but Sheehan
would not have it this way.
In fact, Hebbard's side partner even
went so far as to invoke the aid of the
police to prevent the members of tbe com
mittee from even standing on the side
walk at the entrance to the bank. As in
the Fair case, the police authorities
seemed very anxious to distinguish them
selves in their efforts to please the mon
eyed interests of a civil litigation.
McCarthy then related another instance
of â  * 8 _- c m ' 8 pyrotecbnical financiering.
Sam K. Thornton was very anxious to bÂ«
come a director of the bank. Sheehan
allowed bimtovote 3103 shares of stock
held by Dr. Jennings and paid for with a
note for $107,000. The strange part of it
was that thoy had previously obtained an
injunction to prohibit any one else voting
this block of stock, and it was afterward
declared a fraudulent issue. It served its
purpose, however, at the time, and after
Thornton's election was canceled. Mc- j
Carthy then related numerous ruses of i
Sheehan to retain himself in power.
Attorney Kahn rather startled the court
by declaring that it was only through the
goodness of heart that Judge Hebbard
allowed the depositors in the bank at all.
Tbe resolutions were then read, much to
Hebbard' s chagrin. Judge Daingerfield
thought that there was only a moral duty
on Judge Hebbard's part to comply with
the request contained in them.
"That's all we have said in our libel
added Attorney Shortridire. "We have
but declarea that Judge Hebbard was
morally responsible in this matter."
"But possibly when Judge Hebbard got
these resolutions he did not believe
them,'' said Judge Daingerfield.
"That's the excuse many other men
have made," was the reply.
On cross-examination Kahn wanted to
learn lrom McCarthy if the Bank Com
missioners had not commented favorably
upon Sheehan's management of the bank.
The answer was not to his liking. He
even was for striking it from tbe record
when McCarthy told him that the "com
missioners never indorsed Sheehan's
actions and had told the committee that
they had no jurisdiction over bis doings,
as they did not take charge of the bank
until after he was removed." '.v.
Kahn then sought to introduce a report
of the California Safe Deposit and Trust
Company commending Sheehan's doings.
Attorney Shortridge declared that if this
course were to be pursued he would intro
duce about 1800 documents viewing the
receiver through different spectacles.
Emanuel S. Straus was called to testify
that he had signed a petition to retain
Sheehan at the request of Secretary
Palmer of the bank. He understood at
the time he was acting in the interests of
the depositors.
From George B. Conant, a member of the
depositors' committee, Attorney Short
ridge endeavored to draw the fact that
Watt had b*Â»en paid $250 by the Kansas
City Real Estate Association for an ex
tension of their indebtedness of some
$35,000 to the bank. ..
Kahn asked if this transaction was
recorded in the bankbooks.
"Oh, no," replied Attorney Shortridge,
"These things are never set down in
books."
Judge Daingerfield desired to know if
Judge Hebbard was to be connected with
this transaction. ; . -.
Attorney Shortridge replied that he had
been challenged to prove shortcomings on
the part of Sheehan and Watt, and he ac
cepted the challenge. Judge Hebbard
might not Know of all these things. He
might even be above reproach and yet be
the unconscious tool of the men who
were manipulating the bant*. The record
went to show that Sheehan and Watt
were juggling tbe bank's assets to their
own interests, and Hebbard should have
seen these things, though possibly he did
not. At any rate, he was warned against
and advised of Sheehan's doings.
Benjamin F. Lucy was then called, and
Kahn declared he was willing to waive his
hearing i? he was to corroborate McCar
thy's evidence.
Judge Daingerfield inquired if Lucy was
to tell anything new. -. yjy,
"I do not know," answered Attorney
Shortridge.
The court made an arbitrary ruling that
Lucy could not be heard unless it was
first ascertained if he had any new facts
to relate, in spite of Mr. Shortridee's pro
test, and the case went over until this
morning. '

Flew of Reason at tbe Congregational
Club Meeting ml Banquet
Last Evening.
'â¢There are 100 churches too many in
the State of California, and if they should
die off it would be the best thing for the
kingdom of God." .
That was the novel, and what at first
sight would appear startling, statement
made by Rev. Dr. J. K. McLean at the
meeting of the Congregational Club held
in the Third Congregational Church last
evening. It seemed to strike the fancy of
the ministers present, however, and tbe
applause that followed represented several
denominations.
The circumstances which led up to the
making of the statement tend in great
measure to moderate the force of its ap
plication.
The Ladies' Aid Society of the Third
Congregational Church had prepared a
sumptuous banquet in the dining hall,
and ladies and gentlemen of several dif
ferent churches bad been invited to par
ticipate. A large number responded, and
it was therefore thought advisable to have
a feast of reason as well as of more ma
terial things. Rev. W. W. Scudder, the
president of the club, acted as chairman of
the combined meeting and feast.
Tbe theme for discussion was "Inter
denominational Comity," and various
phases of the subject were assigned to
different ministers. After the banquet,
Rev. S. M. ; Jefferson, LL.D., dean ot the
Berkeley Bible Seminary, opened the dis
cussion, which was limited to ten minutes
for each speaker, by treating of "lis
Grounds." Jj^'y
His notion was that denominations
should try to unite on fundamentals. He
believed that they should be willing to
differ on doctrinal points without any
clashing. *
Rev. Dr. E. R. Dille, pastor of the Cen
tral Methodist Church, followed with a
discussion of its scope. He asserted that
$12,000,000 is annually wasted in this
country on account of a lack of inter
denominational comity.
"Take Healdsburg for instance," be
said. "There is a little city with a popu
lation of only about 2000 and yet it has
eight churches. That is too many.
"I believe a commission should be ap
pointed representing all the evangelical
churches to arrange the placing of
churches according to population. As to
what churches should be placed in any
one city let priority of establishment
determine." JJ :; '. -.:Â»;:-:
Rev. W. H. Loudon, D.D., of the Presby
terian Theological Seminary, spoke on
"Denominationalism Comity." He be
lieved that the ministerial onions should
have more meetings, because they culti
vate a spirit of fraternity and good-fellow
ship.
Rev. J. R. Knodell, pastor of the Pil
grim Congregational Church, Oakland,
took for his theme, "Pioneer Movements.''
He believed that there is at present en
tirely too much talk about comity and too
little done. The last chord in the great
Christian harp of to-day he asserted to be
that of inter-denominational comity and
it should be found at once.
Rev. T. G. Brownson of the California
Baptist College came next with a brief
address on "Present Infelicities." His re
marks were broad and liberal in their
spirit and showed the great difficulties
encountered in the path leading to comity
on the part of the churches.
Then came Dr. McLean, who made the
remark that heads this article, in sharp,
decisive tones, and then proceeded to ex
plain his terse exordium. jJJ-f'J'
"What I mean," he continued, "i*Â« that
there are at least that many superfluous
churches, a condition ot affairs which
tends to retard the power for good of the
church taken as a unit. We are not doing
things in a business-like way by overload
ing a small population with so many
churches. 'â !;.
"The banner of Christ should be higher
than that of John Wesley or John Knox
or John Robinson. Christianity first and
church afterward.
"The superfluous churches should be
weeded out. so the others can grow, and
I am in favor of such a commission as
suggested by Dr. Dille. It could accom
plish much good." â¢ '-''JJAJr
A resolution was then adopted unani
mously, providing that steps be taken
preparatory to the establishment, of a
State commission, which shall have for
its object the placing of evangelical
churches according to population. Rev.
Dr. Rader was present, as well as many
others of the local ministry, but contented
himself with simply listening to the ad
dresses and took no active part beyond
welcoming the invited guests. . ,

There are no hopeful tidings from the

A CHARGE OF PERJURY.
Serious Accusation Against
Banker Brush of Santa
Rosa.
A. L Fish Pressing a Case Before the
Grand Juryâ A Business
Transaction.
J. H. Brush, president of tbe Santa Rosa
National Bank, must have told a long
story to the Grand Jury yesterday, and
incidentally replied to many questions
propounded by the cross-questioners.
According to the facts brought to light
Mr. Brush, on behalf of the water works
at Santa Rosa, purchased some machinery
from B. L. Fish of San Francisco. When
the time came for settling tha accounts of
this business transaction differences arose,
and Mr. Fish sued Brush for a sum less I
than $300. The case was heard by Justice
Cooke, and some tall swearing must have
been done, for when the case was pending
Mr. Fish appealed to tbe Grand Jury to
have the defendant indicted for perjury.
The jury then heard Justice Cook, ttie
plaint. ff and the defendant, but no action
was taken. Subsequently the Justice ren
dered a decision in favor of the plaintiff,
Mr. Fish, but the latter was not satisfied
in winning the suit. He insisted that the
proceedings before the. Grand Jury should
pressed.
In commenting on the case to newspa
per men yesterday Justice Cook expressed
doubt as to tbe veracity of the defendant
in the case. The court did not like the
style in which the Santa Rosa banker tes
tided, and frankly said that he did not
believe tbe testimony to be true.
R. M. Swain, formerly an attorney of
San Francisco, but now a lawyer of Santa
Rosa, represents Banker Brush as coun
sel. Mr. Swain advised his client before
the latter went into the jury-room and
after he came oat.
Mr. Fish was on hand yesterday, but
was not in -the jury-room for any great
length of time. As the case bas been ap
pealed from Justice Cook's court to the
Superior Court the Grand Jury decided to
suspend judgment in the case until the
civil suU is disposed of.
