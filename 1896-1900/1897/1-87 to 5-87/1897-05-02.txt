I OXOON. Eng., May 1. â Official
Europe now has a fresh grievauce
against t'reece. The powers are anx
ious, most of them, to interfere at the
present stage and establish the status
quo of a fortnight ago. They calcu
lated the loss of Tbessaly would be
iimple punishment for the Greeks and
King <n*orge would be only too glad to
cry for succor in such an emergency.
Greece has done nothing of the kind
and the powers, especially Salisbury,
are disappointed and disgusted with
tin- nation which does not know wlhsii
it is beaten. It is persistently reported
in England that France ard Italy arc
unwilling to wait longer for the vol
untary submission of :â  Greece and urge
the concert to interfere unasked. ihe
reason is that every . Turkish success
stiffens the ueck of the Sultan and in â
creases the difficulty of controlling him
in the complicated settlement of affairs
of the Ottoman empire, which was in
terrupted by the war.
The new league of the three Em
perors, it is announced, refuses to in
tervene until the power* are requested
l.v (>roÂ«cp 10 Ml T.iÂ« matter hits gone
still favtlierJ If reports current in dip
lomatic circles are â¢ correct, instead of
Greece humbling herself before her
European mentors, Great Britain finds
her interests so threatened that she is
striving to secretly Induce the Greek
authorities to apply for aid. In other
words, Salisbury, who consented to
punish the Greeks for the purpose of
breaking their spirit, is now beseech
ing them to cry Â« . nough!" because the
rod is really falling upon English
backs It is probably impossible for
the Greeks to continue incorrigible
much longer. but those who con
demned the servile attitude of the
British Government in .Eastern affairs
the past two years will bo glad to see
the present embarrassment of Salis
bury augmented.
The rapid change in the general
European situation in the past week is
of greater importance than the war
developments. It is no longer doubted
that the league of the three timperors is
fully established. Its first act is the
identical note to the people of the Bal
kan peninsula congratulating them on
their refusal to join the Greek cause
against Turkey. The neutrality of the
Balkan! now seems fully assured. This
practically destroy* all doubt of war.
The question chiefly agitating diplo
matic circles is no longer war, but
whether .Russia will be able to bind to
herself -France and Italy in addition to
the two central powers. In other words,
will Great Britain finally be Isolated?
There is Mtlll strong confidence in Lon
don that Salitbury will be able to win
ranee away from the Czar, while
friendship or alliance with Koine, it is
believed, may be had for the asking.
This in expecting a gr sat deal, and there
is really nothing tangible on which the
llsli men base such hopes.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Tikkky, May L
EJhem Pasha telegraphs Sh.it after a se

The point of view is from the Kbassidiari Hills just south of Pharsala. In the Kiddle foreground is the Acropolis perched on the summit of a rock 360 feet high overlooking the city wnich stands at its base,
the western end only being visible.
To the north of Pharsal3 in the distance, on the south bank of the Pencus River, lies the city of Larissa, the headquarters of the Turkish army. Between the two, closely hugged on the west and south by
the Enipeus River, lies the rugged plateau, which, beginning just south of Larissa, gradually rises to the south and west until it culminates in the Cynocephaie or Dog's Head Hills and Mavro Vuni, 2500 feet hign.
On the extreme ritrht, at the foot of Mount Pelion, is tne important port of Volo, at the head of the gulf, and a little to the we-t is Velestino, the scene of the latest fighting, and where the Greeks are said to have
given the Turks a Â«harp repulse. On the left is the city of Kaniitza, still lield by the Greeks, and beyond near the mountains in the northwest is Trikkala, in possession of the Turks. Stretching from the
south along the Enipeus and other branches of the Peneus or Saiembna River to the west, and theuce around by Liri-sa down nearly to Yelestino are the broaa and fertile '"Thessalian Plains," traversing which
are shown the principal roads and the railroad. To the northeast and north Ossa and Olympus are Keen in the distanc?. Across the plateau is the main road from Larissa to Pharsaia. The picture is drawn after
views made by a French artist, and gives a eood idea of the nature of the country.

PREMIER RALLI'S POLICY.
Has Corftd'_- .is fn the Greek Army
to Continue the Struggle Suc
cessfully In Thessaly.
ROME, Italy, May Lâ M. Ralli, the
new Greek Premier, in an interview to-day
with an Italian correspondent, declared
that during the present crisis he would
forget all political questions. 'My pro
gramme," he added, li is to respect tne in
stitutions of the country and save the
monarchy. I have succeede 1, thousrh we
have been little likcl by the court."
ATHENS, Greece May I.â ln a state
ment to-day Ralii said: "Our duty is to
reconstitute the army. The morale of
General Smolenitz's corps is unimpaired,
but the Ministers of the Interior and War
ara going to Pharsala 10 encourage the
others. We shall organize several thou
sands of reserves and volunteers to-day,
and re-enforcements will be pushed for
ward as rapidly as possible. We shall
continue the struggle, if iuceisary. or at
least to act so as not to rind ourselves in
ferior in position to the enemy if the dip
lomats effect a -olution of the situation.
I liave entire confidence in the ability of
the Greek army in Thessaly to continue
ihe struggle successfully. What has
failed us in the present war is the fact,
that we have been working udoii a fixed
l-lan."
TO LURE ON THE TURKS.
How the Greeks Propose to Stir Up
an Insurrection Throughout
Macedonia. â  :
PARIS, France, May L â The Revue
prints a noiabie article on the "Struggle
for Macedonia," tne writerof which is one
of . the leaders of the Greek National
League. He declares the war was entirely
brought about by the highest intellects in
the Hellenic world, professors, savants
and others distinguished in the various
fields of Greek endeavor. Continuing, he
say*, the plan of the league is 10 avoid a
pitched battle with the Turks, but to lure
them toward Athens, promoting an in
surrection meanwhile throughout Mace
donia, the Turkish islands and the old
lonic coasls. Then when the confusion is
at its height among the Turks the -plan
contemplates the destruction of Constan
tinople by fire, in order to ensure a
triumph the writer declares: "Greece will
sacrifice the lives of . her children, towns,
olive groves and all her gold." The arti
cle gives a vivid idea of the projects of tha
league and the extraordinary power it :
wields.
WARLIKE STATESMEN.
Members of the Italian Chamber
of Deputies Ready to Fight
for Greece.
ROME, Italy, May I.â Many members
of the Chamber oi Deputies are anxious
to aid Greece by serving in her army and
have therefore placed themseives at the
orders of Ricotti Garibaldi, son of the
Italian liberator, who went to Greece
some days ago with a number of Italian
volunteers. Garibaldi has declared the
chief aim of Greek commanders should
be the formation of a strong guerrilla
force, by which means the Turks would
be harassed and their line of communica
tion cut.

to reorganize the army, without which it
would be impossible to prosecute the war
or conclude honorable peace. Happily
the army, which was worthy of a better
fate than it bad met, had maintained ita
spirit unimpaired and the country might
rely upon it. He appealed to the Cham

Government, concluding that the Cham

Delyanni3, Ralli's predecessor, con
curred in the request for adjournment,
adding that he would fuliy support the
Cabinet as long as tha Turks occupied an

the purpose of raising money to pay a
mortgaee on their farm, Mrs. Helea Estly,
wife ol Ole E-tly of Lockwood, near Spo
kane, and her daughter Clara visited
Brooklyn and asked the Commissioner of
Charities to-day to pay their way back to
Spokane. Commissioner Eurtis refused
the request, but offered to ?end Airs. Estly
and her daugliter to the Almshouse.
"That is not what we want," ta ; d Mrs.
Estly, "we want money to return instantly
and we will pay back every cent. We
have walked all the way from Spokane,
and tms is the first time we have had to
ask for help. We would not now ask for
assistance but we have news of the diph
theria at home and that my daughter Ber

Mrs. Estly said she had a Husband end
seven children, and expected to raise the
mortgage by selling a book of her travels.
"For eight years," she said, "I have had
mislortunes. Eight years ago I fell and
was badly injured and was ill lor two
years. Seven years ago my husband fell,
fracturing his kneecap. Aiterward a
horse fell on him, completely disabling
him. Five years ago my daughter Ida
went blind. Then my eldest boy pot in
flammatory rheumatism. Two year 3 ago
our house burned down, and, as we had
no insurance, we could only rebuild the
kitchen part. Six months aco my eldest
son Olaf had diphtheria, and now my
daughter Bertha is dead."
Mrs. Estly said that she and her daugh

and made many sketches on the journey,
but had recently lost them. She said Bhe

SHOOT TO SAVE THE LEVEES.
Reck*ess Spanish Skipper Made to Slacken
His Specd â Frightened Negroes
of Louisiana.
NEW ORLEANS, La., May I.â The
farmers of Plnquemines parish yesterday
fulfilled their threat that they would fire
upon vessels going too fast along the lnvee
by attacking the Spanish steamer Espana,
from Liverpool to New Orleans. A volley
from their Winchesters greeted thÂ«
steamer about forty miles below New Or
leans, whereupon she immediately slack
ened her speed and the fifing ceased. No
one was hit ana the assailants apparently
intended the shots to be harmless.
The Levee Board has instructed its at
torney to proceed at once against the
captains of those vessels who run their
steamers at full speed, dashing waves
against the levees and causine consider
able damege.
Lieutenant Paltison, commanding the
Government relief boat Meies, has re
turned from a tour of tlie submerged dis
trict of Louisiana. He could not find a
single neerro who was willing to leave
his overflowed home for free rations in the
refuge camp at Vicksburg.
The negroes were alarmed lest they
should be carried forcibly to Vicksbor^,
and most of them would come ohj within
speaking distance of the boat. Not a
single Louisiana planter wanted rations
for his negroes, all saying that as long as
they were able to feed themselves they
would not accept Government rations.
With the boom in the Arkansas River
coming down, the farmers concluded that
it wili be impo-sible to plant cotton this
year, and will devote themselves to forage
and food crops.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May I.â The De
partment of Agriculture estimated to-day
that the damage done by the floods
was $00,000,0C0 and it covered 20,000 square
miles. The records show that over half a
million of people were impoverished.
What further action the Government will
take in relieving the suffering is not
known, but it is believed that some'.hing
will be done very soon.

HAVANA, Cuba, May I.â Former In
surgenl Zarraga, who surrendered several
days ago to the Spanish, told them of a
large deposit of dynamite the Cubans had
stored in Cuzco, Pinar del Rio.
According to Zarraga the dynamite
bomDs numberei about 400. A Spanish
detachment of about 500 men went to the
place designated by Zirraga to seize the
deposit. In the first search nothing was
found, but later, when nearly all the
Spanish force was hunting about Cnzco
Hill, several bombs exploded, killing more
than 100 soldiers.
The rest of the Spaniards fled, but, find
ing a Cuban force agu.nst them, returned
and surrounded the hi!l. Then, keeping
a safe distance, they fired the trees and
bushes until all the dynamite exploded.
Thursday evening a large body of in
surgents appeared near Guanabacoa, six
miles from Havana, fired on the suburbs
in sight of the Spanish force commanded
by Major Tejerizo, which retired to Guan
abacoa without attempting to fight.
Tejerizo explains the insurgents were
in the military district of Colonel Fonsde
viella ana therefore it devolved upon
Fonsdeviella, not upon him, to attack the
enemy. Fonsdevieila, when notified of
Tejerizo's attitude, started to give battle
10 the Cubans. An engagement followed,
in which, after two hours of firing, both
sides retired, Fonsdeviella to Guanabacoa
and tho Cubans to Minas.
Friday morning the Cubans approached
near the coast, because they saw the sig
nals of an expedition in the oiling. Fons
deviella attacked them between Minaa
and the const in order to capture the ex
pedition. In this second engagement the
Spaniards lost a captain and seven sol
diers killed and ten wounded. The Cu
bans' lo*s was heavy, but the expedition
was landed successfully ana the supplies
safely taken to the interior.

forces combined at Nine.
Ruberio formed the forces consisting of
two columns of 700 marines, 400 of the
navy anil 1290 infantry. Both columns
boarded the Spanish fleet under command
Navarre. This fleet was composed of
the flagship Laguzpi and the men-of-war

Galicia and Ligera, protected by the j
artillery, landed under a heavy fire from j

Meanwhile the marine forces in armed j

a torpedo. The Nueva Espana wns the
first boat to enter the port. The Ligera

The Spanish then advanced, protected !
by the fire from the Nueva Espana, which
bombarded the insurgents on the heights,
ultimately capturing the Cuban fortifica- j
tions with a loss of only a few men.
The Spanish garrison was relieved after

affect the yield to Â«ny great extent."
From other States come the following:
Cypress, Fla.â The fruit crop promises
to bs very light. Mo?t all of the young
peaches have fallen from the trees.
Wiliiamspon, Md.â Five out of every
six growers think that the peach
crop in the mountain peach belt of
Washington County is seriously injured
if not almost wholly killed. Cherries,
plums and appies have suffered to some
extent, while it is not thought that apri
cots are injured in the least. Strawberries
and other small fruits are but slightly
touched.
New Jerseyâ lt is reported from the
southern part of the State that all berries
are badly injured. It is feared that 75 per
cent of the strawberry crop ia injured.
There are probably produced annually in
South Jersey Irom 000,000 to I,ooo.ooo crates
of berries.
New York â Indefinite reports are re
ceived of the pff ct of the Jrost early in
the week upon the crops of the western
part of the State. Niagara County's peach
crop is probably heavily damaged.
Ontario County's currants, peaches and
cherries are believed to be only slightly
injured.
Pennsylvaniaâ A. L. Rogers, a large
peach - grower of Chamberg, reports
that all crops were Destroyed by the freeze
of last week and thai the lo?s will amount
to hundreds of thousands of dollars. In
the valley near Mid vale the freeze was
not as hard, and a crop of about 32 per
cent will be the result.
Michigan â According to William G.
Voorhies, a Benzine County grower, the
fruit buds of Central and Southern Michi
gan are nearly all ruineu and the yield
will be exceedingly light.

bloom was very heavy and it is estimated
that the crop will be injured from 25 to 50
per cent
West Virginia â Reports from nearly
every section of the State indicate that
early fruit crops of ev?ry kind have been
almost entirely destroyed. Peaches were
in full bloom and all are killed. It is
thought that there will be a fair crop of
late apples, but the earlier varieties will
fail entirely. In Preston, a large apple
growing county, there will scarcely be a
wagon load.
Manager Ackley of the Dudley (Ohio)
Fruit-growers' Association reports that
the peach crop of Southeastern Ohio will
I be an entire failure and that there will be
no apples of commercial value. Fruits of
all kinds in that section are materially in
jured by the recent frosts.

FAMOUS ARAGO
CASE ON APPEAL
Petition for Rehearing
in U. S. Supreme
Court.
Judge Maguire and J. H. Ral
ston Represent the
Appellants.
Strong Argument as to the Mean-
Insr of Voluntary and Invol
untary Servitude.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May I.â ln the
United States Supreme Court to-day
Judse Maguire and J. H. Ralston, attor
neys for appellants, fiied a petition for
a rehearing in tho celebrated Arago case,
on appeal from Juduo Morrow's decision
in the District Court for the Northern
California district. They also ask for a
recall of mandate.
Ttiis is the case of Robert Robertson vs.
Barry Baldwin etal.
Judge Morrow denied the application
for a writ of iiabeas corpus in the case of
Rober.son and three other penmen, who
were held for failure to perform certain
duties, on the ground that the term "invol
untary servitude" did not apply to cases
where ibe contracts were entered into
willingly by both parlies.
Robertson's attorneys, in their petition
and argument, drew many comparisons
between lhe holding of the court and the
fugitive slave cases.
Messrs. Maguire and Ralston in their
brief presented to the court to-day declare
that the construction given to the thir
teenth amendment to the constitution of
the United States, and particularly to the
term "involuntary servitude" as used
â¢.herein, in the decision rendered by the
court, is of great importance to the people
of the United States generally, and very
materially affects the liberties and rights
not only of these appellants, but also of
great numbers of such citiz.ns other than
the appellants.
The argument in favor of the position
that servitude under a contract volun
tarily made can never become lecaliy in
voluntary under the terms of the thir
teenth amendment, is that a contrary
construction would be destructive of the
merchant marine service, because in Uiat
service it is necessary that sailors be
bound to serve upon the ships to which
they are articled lor the voyage, or other
term for which they contract, and that in
this respect the merchant marine service
is and ever ba3 been essentially different
from all other private employments.
'We cannot, 1 ' they say, "conce.le that
even the truth of that assumption would
justify or permit a construction denying
the protection to American sailors that is
guaranteed to all citizens by any pro
vision of the constitution, but ton assump
tion is without foundation. If the con
struction given by the court to the thir
teenth amendment, be adhered to., there
la great danger that designing' per
sons not iulliciently regarding the sacred
right of their fellow-citizuns to liberty and
the pursuit of happiness, may take ad
vantage of their pecuniary distress and
difficulties to reduce them to a condition
of slavery under the form of contracts to
labor, and in this behalf it is a matter of
common knowledge tQat thousands of im
poverished citizens at all times and mil
lions of cit zens in periods of industrial
depression, being land ess and therefore
without means of independent self-sup
port, ciin be teadily induced by reason of
their helplessness and the overwhelming
pressure of their inability otherwise
to procure the common necessaries
of life, to sim away their liberties, ci her
for lifo or fixed term?, precisely as these
appellants, under pressure of that very
privation, were obliged to enter into the
contract lor servitude, the rigors and un
endurable hardships of which they sought
to escape by fleeing from the immediate
control of their masters to the soil of the
free S;ate of Oregon.
"Indeed, it is alarming to contemplate
the exent to which contract slavery may
be forced upon the landless laborers of the
country, white as well as black, by a mere
concert of action, prompted by the plain
est inducements of self-interest on ihe
part of employer*, to exclude such land
less and therefore helpless and dependent
laborers from employment until they shall
ue compelled by their privations to sign
sucli contracts for personal setviiude as
will bind them for life or for long terms
to the contract and dominion of individ
ual masters."

WASHINGTON, D. C, May I.âSena
tor Plait and Secretary .Bliss, it is said,
have formed a political partnership to
jointly dispose of the Federal patronage.
Bliss is to be the business men's) candi
date for Mayor of Greater New York.
The news has created a great -at ion
here and many politicians refine to believe
that Bliss would relinquish National as
pirations even for so great an honor as
being Mayor of Greater New York. His
alliance with Senator Piatt show* that
McKinley and Platt are now reconciled
and the warfare which Piatt threatened
against the administration has happily
been averted. The alliance is regarded as
a great political coup of Piait's, and as
tute politicians here give him full credit
for the move. '?' â¢;

which time I underwent several surgical

my improvement was, so slow that I be-

I would never get strong again. I was

and I did not care to live. One day I met
a friend who had taken Hood's Sarsa-

I had taken a few doses I began to feel
better and had a better appetite. I gained
from two to three pounds a week and

1 re: arations have been going on for
:.s in connection with the bullying
of the Transvaal, and even the average
civilization ought to know that such
things have to be paid for. The main ad
vantage of the budget's statement ha?
c -eared the ground somewhat, and elicited
Irom the man who will be chiefly respon
sible for tne war, if it should come, the
unblushing admission oi England's pirat
ical designs upon the small republic,
wh ; cb, having no powerful friends will
ing or neor enough to render help, may
presumably be coerced with impunity.
It was reported some time ago that
Chamberl.iin's plans against the Trans
vaal included the use of a strong force of
British troops from the garrison in India.
This is no longer denied, but there is rea
son to bel;eve these British soldiers will
ba accompanied by native troops. The
British Government pees no shame in
using colored heathen fighters against the
Christian white citizens of a South Afri
can repubiic, and believes the nation sees
no stiame in it either. But the case wiil
liout any â¢queamishr.es?. The Tory
newspapers are Leginning to educate tne
c up io the level of these century-end
war methods. One journal gives promi
nei.co '.o a coniruunicstion recalling what
U:e Sikhs and Ghurkos have done- for
Kngiand in India and insisting that "dis
honor" muÂ«t not be cast upon these gal
lant fellows by preventing them from
B side by side against the empire's
enemies, be they black or white.
"Let it not be forgotten," says the
writer, "that righting is second nature to
many of the-e natives, and to keep them
out of the fight will be not only to lose
their immediate help but their future ioy
a!'.f ;o ihe Union Jack, thÂ»t glorious sym
bol of liberty and empire which the white
man is tating to tha uttermost ends of the
<?ar:h."
Doubtless these sinister arguments will
be strengthened in ttie course of time.
Already Englishmen have bjen reminded
that Beaconjfield sent regiments of India
troops to.Maha. \Vhy should not Salisbu-y
send a Isvt thousands to Caps Town? If
one may judge from Harcourt's speech thÂ«
Liberal party will offer determined oppo
sition io any warlike enterprise against
the Transvaal. But it is doubtful if this
w.ill prove of practical value. The gov
ern nient has been preparing for the
sha'tneful confl.ct ever since the semi
official expedition under Jamieson failed
ignobly, and only feeble protests have
iee:i tuarJ from time to time. The
J. i>Â°rai newspapers have not been doing
their duty as they should. Several of the
mo-t influential among them have been
either" bribed by capitalists or cajoled by
dukej, marquises and viscounts, who
have sought to repair their shattered
fortunes by South African investments.

The trouble originated in the failure of
the crops, owinj: to a prolonged droucht
:d: lowing tLe previous bad years. Farm
ers every where were ruined, but despite
this strenuous efforts were made by tax
collectors to obtain a full payment of
taxes, which, since the outbreak of the
insurrection, have been intolerable in
amount. Tue bankruptcy of the land
owners and iarmers had a natural effect
upon the general body of Â«ericnltural
workers, who have heon driven to some
thins; very like rebellion. Tnis moment
bands of desperate men are scouring the
country -Â«ide corn mitt:ng all kinds of ex
cesses. The Oclrui building, where taxes
are collected upon produce coming into
town, has been sacked, farms pillaged and
burned and shorn looted. And yet the
Government cannot spare soldiers to sup
press the brigands or money to succor the
starving peopie.

OFFICIAL PRECEDENCE.
The Frzsident Very Emphatically Settles
the Question in Favor of the
V cc- President.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 1.-Tbe
question of precedence, which threatened
to disturb the amity of nations because
some foreign Embassadors were bent upon
overshadowing the Vice-president, has
been settled. It is practically certain now
that the honors of this bloodless strife
rest with the Vice- President, but the vic
tory has been achieved through no action
of his own. It is asserted that the Vice-
President has manifested no personal in
terest in the matter, the chief facior in
the settlement beine the President him
self, who, it is said, has gone so far as to
give assurance that when the proper time
comes he will hold that, for the purpose
of precedence and eiiauette, the offices of
President and Vice-President cannot be
separated because of their interdependent
constitutional relation and because the
Vice-President is heir to toe Presidency.
Those wiih the President during the
Grant exercises in .New York noticed the
genuine solicitude he displayed in his de
sire to see that nÂ«xt to himself the place
of honor shoud fall to Hobart, During
the exercises at the tomb the place of
honor was accorded to the Vice-President,
who not only rode along the line of march
with the President, but sat directly on the
President's left all through the exercises,
while the Embassadors were disposed in
position of prominence somewhat to the
rear. %
To make this relation more conspicuous
the President insisted that the Vicr-Pres
ident should sit immediately at his side
in the place of honor during luncheon.
L,3ter in the evening, when the President
and Vice-President were entertained by
the Union League Club, the President and
Vice- President sat at the first table of
honor, while Pauncefote sat with Depew
at another table.
The German Embassaior has already
recognized the integrity of the position
assumed by the President and Vice-Presi
dent in the matter of precedence, and it is
believed tbat within a short time the Em
bassadors will entirely abandon their fight.

Adminiutrntion.
WASHINGTON, D. C. May Lâ When
Harold M. Sewall was nominated tor Min
ister to Hawaii it was stated in The Call's
dispatches that it was an indication that
the administration was in favor of the an
nexation of the islands. This prediction
is now conceded to have been i orrect.
Minister Sewall had a long talk with the
President a week ago, and will depart for
his post of duty with full instructions as
to his procedure. Meanwhile the propo
sition to repeal the Hawaiian reciprocity
treaty is one of the absorbing topics of in
terest.
Senator Frye, in an interview, said to
night: ''Ten days ago I should have re
plied that there was very great danger of
the abrogation of the treaty. 1 say now
that I don't thins its abrogation is possi
ble."
But others who are equally conversant
with the situation disagree with the Maine
Senator. It is a close question at all
events, and there is no doubt but that a
determined light will be made for the
treaty's repeal.

Vainly they tried to quench their thirst
by sucking, ice and chewing their leather
belts, and their vitality was speediiy ex

Alter two days' exposure the castaways
began to succumb. Four died on the
third day. six on the fourth, three more
succumbed on the fifth day and another
four on the day preceding the rescue.
Many deliberately threw themselves into
the sea to avoid further suffering, whilp
others died raving mad. The effect on
the survivors was appalling. They are
still haunted by tha terrors of these spec
tacle*, especially by the actions of those
who, becoming insane, sought to overturn
the boat to end the misery of all.

Young August Norman, who had worked
at Knute Hillsteadt's fnrm, eight railea
west of Larimore, called there last night,
and, finding the father of the family ab
sent, requested permission to remain all
night. Mrs. Hillsteadt demurred, be
cause she was afraid, of Norman ; but he
insisted, and was finally taken in.
Just before 1 o'clock this morning Nor
man tiptoed to Mrs. Hlllsteadt't room and
asked to be admitted, saying he wanted to
discuss business mat .era.
Mrs. Hillsteadt, who had been awake all
nisht, refused to answer. Norman threat
ened to kill her and her four children. He
tried to batter down the door. Failing, he
rushed upstairs to the room of Mrs. Hill
steadt'a 15-year-old son Peter and cut his
throat with a razor.
Returning again, he demanded ml

back to the sidewalK walked around the
corner of Main street to his office, just as
though the unpit-asant interview had
never occurred. It wai all so unexpected
and was over so quickly that very few
people saw it. Those who chanced to bo
iii Main street could not see it, for the
reason that the doctor stood so closely to
the buggy that the top shielded him from
view, anl just at that hour tfce street was
almost deserted.
There were a couple of witnesses to the
affair, however. One person who saw it
>aid thai ths woman in the bugpy â Mrs.
Pearson, the wife of Fire Chief Pearson
declared after striking the doctor, "I'll
fix you!" But the lady herself says she
did not use that expression. She had
driven by the doctor a few minutes be
fore, accompanied by a temale compan
ion. Sha says that the physician stared
at her in such a manner that it attracted
the atteniion of her lady frieud, who
mentioned t c fact.
'â Isn't that awful?" she said.
To use tho language of Mr.Â«. Pearson
herself, it made herb ood boil, and snort y
afterward she drove bacfc alone. Upon
meeting the physician the second tiraa
Bhe reined up her horse, as described, and
struck out with her whip.
"If I had had a pistol I wou!d have shot
him," remarked the lady aiterward.
"When I returned home I told my hus
band of the matter, and told him that If
he would go with me I would publicly
horsewhip the doctor on Main street last
night. Dr. Bulson has been staring at me
in such a wav that I could not stand it,
and 1 was determined not to. He has been
staring at me now or a long time, and
whenever he pa*s?s ray home he always
looks over at me in a very offens.ve man
ner."
Dr. Brlson was seen by a reporter and
denied vigorously that the woman had
struck him. When questioned the physi
cian said that she might have struck at
him and he not have known it.
"She might have hit the pott," He added,
referring, presumably, to a telegraph pole
near 'he scene of the occurrence Tne
doctor aid not deny that sne called him
up to her bneitrv.

; SAN RAFAEL, Cal , May 1. â The
fame of GilliÃan's hack, in which ex-Sena

San Rafael, is beine heralded about the
streets, and on the arrival of the trains
from San Francico the cabmen cry in
thunderous vote that they have Gil

t: c public demand for rides in the famous
vehicle thai more than one Gilligan hack
h.is come into existence, and lo! If the
demand increases every wagon or carry
all in the town will be put forward as Gil
ligan "s back.;
When a curious person alights from a
train at this place now and asks for Gilli
gan's hack, a dozen men sprint forward
to offer the -'only genuine vehicle in which
Senator Fair rode when he visited San
Rafael," so with the celebrated will case
dragging its weary ., way through a San
Francisco probate court, the San Rafael
cabmen are reaping a gold'-n harvest, and
to pick out Gillisan's hack would be an
undertaking fraught with almost insur
mountable difficulties. â¢ ;7mm

Interesting Disclosures In an Ac

Mortgages.
CARSON, Nev.. May 1. â The suit
brought by the United States Govern
ment to set aside a transfer of mortgages |
by James Heney, convicted of stealing
b.uHi.on from ihe Carson mint, to his at
torneys, William Wood barn and Trenmor
< 'i â iftin, brought out some interesting facts j
:.to-<i.ay in the United States court. It was j
â¢Shown that the tranbfer of the mortgages j
to his attorneys wus made in the County j
JflU after the jury brought fa a verdict of
;y
--lienfty testified that Coffin agreed to
handle nis case for $-500, and then tried to
. defraud bim by claiming payment for ex- j
tra work. Coffin took charge of the case i
two days before the trial. An attempt
Fas made to show wJiat special work Cof- '
â  < =samaÃÃmvmmamsmmmaaam3Bmmajfj.
â¢ :
I fin was to have done at the eleventh hour,
1 but the court cut it short by saying:
"The mint case has been tried and de
cided, and it is not material whether
Coffin was employed for an honest or a ilis- '
uonesi purpose. The only question at
issue is whether the transfers of the mort
i gap -s were fraudulent or not."
Heney swore that he wa* advised to ;
I Have a witness in the jail when the trans- !
I fers were made, as Coffin would try to j
I defraud him.
"I was convicted at fl r. K. and the
transfer followed immediately alter," said
he. ''I had $4000 in the bank and mort
gages to the value oi $11,000. I turned the
money over to Jacob Klein to indemnify
him from any loss on my bond. I drew
$.400 with Klein's conseni, and $IbOO re
! rnained on the night of conviction. The |
money was not in the jail on the night of
the transfer, but was brought there the
next day and Cottin attempted to make
me repay a bill for fixing up samples in
Atnerton's potato patch, but 1 would not
stand his work and did not."
Heney 's reference to the potato patch
concerns the attempt made during his
trial to prove ttat the gold missing irom
the mint bad not been stolen, but had
sifted away in the wastepipes. To bear
out this contention, the defense caused !
the adjoining potato held to be searched, 'â 
l and succeeded in locating amalgam.
Attorney Coffin represented on the
stand that Keney bad urged him many
times to come into the case. Heney
claims otherwise, and the two now seem
to be bHtÂ«r enemies. Mrs. Heney swore
that Coffin came to her house and re- |
pudiated the agreement made in the jail I
and wanted cash. It is believed that I
H^ney will take the stand on Monday in
rebuttal find give some very lively testi
mony.
Diatrioi Attorney McGowan was called for
the defense. He he..rd Wuodburn suy that

killed are looking for him. He is a very
dangerous Indian, and it is predicted that
he will commit another murder or two be

to be a good shot, and the Indians are
afraid to follow him very closely, but are
watching for a chance to "cci the drop"

Orders From Washington Do

Long Cruise Ahead of the Cutter
Bear When the Closed Sea
son Expires.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., May 1-
The Bering Sea fleet, which is rendezvous
ing here preparatory to sailing for the north
on May 5, is in receipt of orders which
will govern its movements this season in
the north. AH is now in readiness for the
start, despite the fact that the first orders
for the 15th as the starting date have been
replaced by otheri advancing the date to
the :. h.
The orders, it is learned from a reliable
source, do not differ from those of last
year in any material respect. The only
vessel which has had additional orders is
the Bear, Captain Francis Tattle, and
from the tenor of these it is apparent that
the jolly jack tars aboard that craft are
not to be given a great deal ol time to get
lonesome in.
1 7 1
During the earlier stage of tier absence
in the north the Bear will participate in
the patrol against peiagic sealers. At the
expiration of the closed season, when all
ihe other vessels of the fleet will start on
their way back to civilization, the Bear
will be utilized for an inspection trip to
too different Government schools in
Alaska, to be made by the Rev. Sheldon
Jackson, Superintendent of Education for
the district. At the conclusion of this in
spection the Bear will proceed to Sitka, at
which piace Rev. Mr. Jackson will be
transferred to one of the regular passenger
steamers for his return home.
Then the real work of the Bear will
commence, for the "discharge" of Dr.
Jackson will mean the beginning of her
regular annual cruise to the most north
ern portion of the western ocean, whither
she goes each year to carry supplies to
the reindeer stations, as well as to give
assistance in case of necessity to the large
fleet of whalers which spend years at a
time among the ice floes of the Arctic
Ocean in the vicinity of Bering Straits.
As was the case last season the fleet will
be commanded by Captain Calvin O.
Hooper, who will make his, headquarters
at Oonaiaska and from there direct the
movements of the different vessols.
The Bering Sea lleet this year will not,
as has been printed in several newspapers,
include any vessels from tho navy, but
will be made up of the following: United
States cutter Richard Rush, 300 tons. Cap
tain Roberts, now outfitting at San Fran
c sco; United States cutter U. S. Grant,
263 tons, Captain T. Munger, now outfit
ting at Seattle; United States cutter Com
modore Perry, 282 tons, Captain Phillips,
now outfitting at Seattle; United States
cutter Thomas Corwin, 213 tons, Captain
Herring, now at San Diego ready for sea;
United States cutter Bear, 714 tons, Cap
tain F. Tuttle, now at Seattle and ready
for sea. - .'

BUDD PLANS CHANGES.
Themis O'Neil Said to Be Slated lor
Superintendent of Preston
School.
BACKAMEXTO, Cal., May Lâ lt is
rumored that Governor Budd has some
important changes in contemplation,
among which is the removal of the pres
ent superintendent of the Preston School
of In(iiiÂ«.trr, who will be replaced by ex-
Sheril'f O'Neil of this city.
Mr. O'Neil is an ardent Democrat, who
contributed Inrgely to Budcl's nomina
tion at the Democratic convention and
to whose handiwork can be traced the
large vote polled by the incumbent in
Sacramento City and County. During
the last session of the Legislature it was
at one time surmised that Mr. O'Xeil
would replace Warden Aull at the FolÂ«ora
State- prison, but the scheme fell through.
It is claimed also, that the Governor ia
seriously considering the advisability of
removing the State Printing Office to
either the Whittier or Preston School,
and in the future have the wort per
formed by the inmates, but it is said that
State Printer Johnson will not only tile a
strong protest, but that he has openly de
clared that being under bond to care for
the machinery, he will not allow oue
single type removed from the building.

New Experiments With Double Bat

MILL VALLEY, Cal., May I.â Deputy
Sheriff John H. Manner, whose recent '
discovery in electricity by which hfc is j
enabled to preduee a brilliant arc lleht
by means of a simple battery charged with ,
a fluid, the, ingredients of which are
known only to himself, will not lack for
assistance when he concludes to place his .
discovery uron the market. Since tne ex
clusive publication in la<-t Sunday's Call
he has received offer? of assistance and
propositions from various sources, many
of them being thoroughly reliable. One
letter is from an electrician, who states
that he has been working on the same
kind of a proposition for some time, and
expresses himself as pleased that his
theory has been successfully brought into
practice. "'.. " .[ . . i
Mr. Magner was seen at bis laboratory
last evening aria asked for a further de
scription of his wonderful discovery.
Said he: .. . ':. -V/.C>.; ..
"lam quite willing to explain the mat
ter, but as tne entire secret lies in the solu
tion witb which the cells are rilled it
would hardly be policy for me to divulge
the nature of the various chemicals. Were
I to do that the worK of two years woukl
be lost and others woud reap the benefits
of my labors and discovery. : : ":'
â¢ For a iong time electr:cians have been
attempting to produce a light by means
Of a battery which will do away with the
costiy dynamos. Every one know* that a
tiny spark can be teen in the simplest
batteries, such as operate electric bells,
but how to increase that spark and : pro
duce an arc light has beÂ«n a puzzler. â : This
I Lave discovered, accidentally, i will ad
mit, but nevertheless the method: of pro
ducing it ii within my power. / \ "
"lam now engaged in increasing the
brii.iancy of the light and reducing the
cost of making the fluid. When I have
this latter down to a commercial value I
will immediately put the produce upon
the market with proper protection, but
until 1 have accomplished this to. my sat
i-:actlon I will decline the offers which
have so generously been made."
Mr. Magner will this ween set up a
double set of batteries with which he will
experiment. He has great faith in his
discovery and Delieves that he will be en

FOUGHT WITH HIS CAPTIVE.
Supposed Chicken-Thief Badly Wounded
by a Sicramsnto Officer Who
Arrested Mm.
SACRAMENTO, Cax. May I.â Deputy
Sheriff Max Fisher, while attempting to
day to arrest a surpo^ei chicken-thief in
the woods near the spot where the Brady-
Browning train robbery took place in
Yoio County, encountered, he claims, a
desperate resistance which resulted in his
shooting his man, the bullet entering
high up ou the left side and producing a
proDably fataL wound. The wounded man,
who i 3 65 years of age, gives the name of
James McÃay. He is believed to have
been implicated in a series of wholesale
chicken thefts for some months past la
; the surrounding country. Fisher had
been after him fcr several da}'s.
"1 captured a supposed confederate of
Mcltav's to-day and he led me to the lat
ter' s biding-piace," Fisher said to-night.
"It was in the thick brush near the rail
road track. As soon as I came onto the
man I drew my r-volver and toll him he
was under arrest. 1 gave my handcuffs
to the man who had accompanied me
ana told him to snap them on the
prisoner. He got one cuff on and I
stepped toward Mcllay, who made a
; spring and caught me by the throat with
one hand and grabbed my pistol with the
i other. As he did so he said to his part
! ner, 'Help take the gun away and we'll
| kill him. Dead men tell no tales.'
"Th en i made a tight for my life. 'Jhe
man was much stronger than I, and twice
I felt the muzzle of my own pistol pressed
apainst my body, but I clung to the Jock
with all my strength. Feeling that I was
growing rapidly weak, I made one desper
ate effort, ttie gun exploded and the man
fell like a log."
McKay gives an entirely different ver
sion of the affair. He says:
"I hai been camped in the woods for
two days, and this afternoon, while cut
ting some wood, a man walked up to me
aud said, 'I am an officer and place you
under arrest, 1 at the same time pointing a
pistol at my head. Then he said, 'Get
down on yÂ«ur knees or I'll blow your
whole head (Jff. ! I saw that be was very
iiiucn agitated and visibly trembling, aud
tearing that m hs excitement he would
shoot I dropped on my knees, sayine at
the Â«ame time, 'You have made a mistake,
but I won't resist you ' Then he told the
oth^r mar. to put the handcuffs on me.
"When he snapped one cuff on my wrist
the officer told me to Â«et up and I "did so.
He took hold of the other cuff end said,
'Come on.' 1 asked him to allow me to
get ray coat and he said,* ' All right'; but
when I went to get it he gave me a yank
and said, 'Never mind ; let the coat go.' I
tried to pull away to pick up my coat and
he tired."
After the shooting the man was re
moved to the Receiving Hospital in this
city, and physicians dressed the wound.
Being unable to locate the bullet in the
man's body, they are nnaole to say what
tbe result will be.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 2, 1897.
CARRIE DIMOND
MAKES HER DEBUT
She Exhibits Little Ner
vousness and Less
Clothes.
Leads an Amaz n March and
Performs a Remarkable
"Coon" Walk.
Performance of "Ali Bjbi" That Gives
Most of the Prominecce to Morgi
ana, the Slave Girl.
It was a well-dressed, decorous audi
ence that, half amused and half shocked,
watched Mrs. Carrie Hegley Dimond
come as near posing for the "altogether"
atthe Auditorium Theater last night, as
American prejudices permit.
The play was "Morgiana, or the Forty
Thieves," but it would have been better
named "Mrs. Diamond in Tights." for the
star's desire to catt aside .'ill superfluous
clothing was the most salient feature in
the whole performance.
The young ladies of the ballet were ar
rayed in even more invisible costumes
MRS. CARRIE DIMOND, Who Made Her Debut Last Evening
in Tights.
than usual, to be in keeping with Mrs. Di
mond. Some of them looked distinctly as
if they did not like it, for with young
ladies of the ballet dancing and treading
the mazy Amazon march is a business
done for bread and batter. As for Mrs.
Dimond herself, she had no more neivous
ness than she bad clothes.
The fair debutante did not burst upon
her audience in the lull glory of an amaz
on costume and on her first appearance,
she let people down gradually. In thÂ»
opening scene where the persecuted
Morgiana left her wasntub to talk over
the situation with Ali Baba's family, she
was arrayed in jewels, and thin India silk,
through the sheen of wnich very Dink
tights were distinctly visible.
Of course Morgiana sang, and anon Mrs.
Dimond showed herself to be the happy
possessor of two distinct voices, one of a
qualiiy verging on barytone, the other a
mezzo-soprano of quite a high compass,
fihe began "One Smile for Her" in the
mezzo-soprano voice, but broke off in the
middle, gazed reproachfully at the leader
of the orchestra and then began again in
the barytone voice, when sbe wandered
down into profound depths and aston
ished the audience into loud applause.
Mrs. Dimond did not resist an encore;
on the contrary, she gave a knowing
glance at the andience and began a
"coon" walk which astonished people
more than the barytone notes. For the
sake of variety doubtless she sang the
coon song in her mezzo-soprano voice, in
terspersing it with the walk and an occa
sional kick just to show the tights.
Her selfpossession was something mar
velous. Sue evidently tried hard to fol
low in the naughty', risque little footsteps
of naughty little music-hall singers, and
she came surprisingly near succeeding.
With a little practice it is easy to believe
that she might become quite a pet of the
gallery chappies.
Mrs. Dimond's sensational act was the
amazon march. When she came on in
the airy costume a few women hissed, and
a great many people lauirlie !. She was
anything but graceful in the mazy evolu
tions of the march, Dut there was no deny
ing that she looked a hne figure of a
woman.
As for the rest of tha performance, sorre
of it was good and some of it was poor.
The costuming was clittering and hand
some, and the extravaganza seemed to
have been well rehearsed. A .ballet,
largely composed of the girls who danced
at the Orpbenm last Christmas, did some
pretty work, and of the speaking char
acters the best ncting was done by Louis
Wood as Ali Bab*, Bert Van Cleve as a
comic slave, Miss .Fannie Warren as an
old hag and Misa Jenette Barrett as a
favorite of the harem.
THEOSOPHISTS AT LOS ANGELES.

rooms of the Friday Morning Club, under
the auspices of the local Thensophical So

part of the evening nearly 200 persons met
to do honor to these advance agents of
tne occult. Several musical numbers were
followed by happy and encouraging ad
dresses by the Quests of honor.
SAN DIEGO, Cal , May I.â Mrs. Annie
Besant, the theosophist leader, to-day or

and about $3000 already expended in im

SAN BERNARDINO'S ROMANCE.
Aged John Cram and His Preti/ Young
Wife Principals in Divorce
Proceedings.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., May I.â
The old axiom tbat "December and May
<ause many misfits" was again exemplified
to-day in Department 1 of the Superior
Court of this county. It was in the
divorce proceedings of John Cram, an
aÂ«ed and once prosperous rancher Of
Highland, against nis wife, Carrie Cram,
a buxom laas of some 25 or 30 summers.
Some time ago Cram, by bis attorneys,
commenced divorce proceedings, alleging
a long list of marital infelicities, among
the lightest of which were being shot at,
clubbed, chloroformed and pelted with all
kinds of missiles. His wife cross-com
plained ana alleped an equal score of cru
elties and indiÃnhies heaped upon her.
Ail around it appeared aB if they had in
dulged in a monkey and parrot siesta
daily.
The case came up yesterday on an order
tosnow.cause why the plaintiff did not
obey the order of the court and pay his
wife $205 alimony, Immediately after the
filing of his suit Crane deeded to his
brother his ranch, one of the finest in this
sectiou, alleging that to that relative be
was deeply in debt. Since then he has
made affidavit that he was without means
to pay alimony, but a few days ago it was
discovered that a neighbor owed him $900
on a note that had been overlooked and it
was to compel him to pay alimony from
this source that the proceedings were in
stituted.
When court convened Cram, stooped
and tottering under his 75 years of life,
was on hand, and his attorney began to
explain away tne existence of the note,
alleging thai Cram was without a dollar
in ttie world.
To all of this Judge Oslee listened at
tentively, and in summing up the case
plainly told the plaintiff tnat it was only
his extreme ace and failing health that
saved him from a term in jail for con
tempt. Turning to the clerk of the court
he ordered him to strike the case fiorn the
calendar until the plaintiff, who is sup
peed to have plenty of means, r>a\s the
$205 and ?3o a month from the Ist day of
April.
WALLOWA'S DERELICT SHERIFF.
Convict Confesses That (he Officer Helped
Him 10 Escape From a Ccun y
Jul.
VALE, Oi:f. , May I.â John Jordan, who
was sentenced lo the penitentiary in Wal
lowa County on Thursday, under tne name
of George Howard, and who has been
taken to Harney County to be sentenced
upon a conviction in that county of steal
ing cattle, made a confession while in jail
in Vale last Sunday. Jordan says that
two dayÃ before* he escaped from the Har
ney County jail Gitting*, who was Sheriff
at that time, slipped into the jail and,
handing the prisoners two new carpenter
chisels, told them to dig. They worked
on the hole In the floor for two days, and
on the night of the second Gittings came
in. opened the door and told them to get
out. Of course they went, and twelve
hours elapsed before pursuit was insti
tuted, and then the posse was muled by
the Sheriff.
Just after the June election and the de
feat of Giitings ho disappeared from Har
ney County, ami soon thereafter it was
discovered that he was a defaulter.
Jordan says he met Gittings at the races
at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the iatter part of
last summer, and Gittings told him tbat
he had "cleaned up" about $7000. This ia
about the amount claimed by his victims,
many of whom will be obliged to lose the
money paid, as they have nothing but
Gittings' private receipts, which do not
show as part payments of taxes. The lons
of the county will be covered by The offi
cial bonds of Gittinga if they are not de
fective.
Gittings had a woman with him and
some $2000 in money, and s:iid that he
.had snipped the balance of the money
into the British possessions, where he
would mate his future home.

Benjamin Cleary, the House of Correc

watching a gang of prisoners and cad a

cery at Sunnyside, wa3 summarily dis
charged by Sheriff Wheian yesterday.
The Sheriff was at first inclined to treat
the youn? man leniently, believing tnat
tne breach of discipline was light, and
sent for mm intending to read him a lec

wden he found how grave had been the
offense, he decided that the discipline of
the office would not permit of Cleary's re
maining in the employ of the municipa
lity.
"I am really much surprised," said the
Sheriff yesterday, "at the trouble that
Cieary got into. He always appeared to
be a nice young fellow and I have always
had good reports of him from Captain
Ciarkson. 1 did not know that he drank
at all.
"From what I can learn be took the
prisoners out to work on the roads, and it
appears that tney stopped at several places
and bought drinks. Aii were a little un
der the weather when they reached
Bcbtxlts'i place, and he refused to give
them anything more to drink. Then they
became abusive, and Cleary iried to quiet
the men. A tight resulted, during wnich
the lunch-counter was smashed aud some
other small damage done.
'I do not believe that the damage will
reach near $100, as Hchultz claims, but the
offense is none the ieas grave, and Cleary
has lost his job for good."
Captain Ciurksou also speaks highly of
Cieary, and says he was one ot the beÃt
guards at the jail.
deary's position wai worth Â£35 per
month and boaid, aud he gave a portion
of bis salary to his mother. He was abont
to be married, and feels the lon of this
position more on thiÂ« account.
His mother called on Schuitz yesterday
and begged the groceryman not to push
the claim for damages egainst the Sheriff,
on the ground that if nothing more was
â¢aii her son might regain his position.
Schuitz agreed to say no more about it if
he was paid $'â  >, and mother and son
agreed to pay teat amount to-night.
Mrs. Cleary then called on the Sheriff
to intercede for her son, but Mr. Whelan
was obdurate and refused to take the
young man back.
Cleary has not received his salary
demand for April, and it may be held to
settle the damage to Schultz's place.

FINAL WORDS
FOR PURE FOOD
President Jordan Favors
Laws Against Adul
teration.
The Congress Adjourns to Re
new Its Work at the
End of a Year.
There Is a General Belief That Much
Gooi Has Ben Done by the
Convention.
Yesterday concluded the deliberations
of the Pare Food Congress, and there was
a genernl impression tbat it resulted in
much good. Governor Budd sent a sec
ond letter regretting that he could not be
present and statins that he fully indorsed
the principles of the congress.
Mrs. Woollier addressed the congress in
favor of pure baking powder, after which
President David Starr Jordan delivered
the address of the day. He said that lie
came to speak in order that he might
show the deep interest he felt in the move
ment; not that he knew anything about
pure food, nut having seen any to his
knowledge since he ieft the farm twenty
five years ago. He thought the law with
reference to the manufacture and sale of
impure food did not go far enough. It
siioii.ti not only bs made very unprotit
able.but extremely disagreeable. Every of
fender should be fined and sent to jail.
Every maker of impure food should be
compelled to put his name on the label
and state the ingredients in the mixture

acid and colored with aniline dyes, was ot
fÂ«red for sale as jelly, the people had a
right to know wnat they were eating.
Some people say that legislation should
be made to enforce virtue, but this would
be based on each man's interests or tastes.
Tney had a man in Kansas who wanted
to enforce the Ten Cummandments by
means of legislation. '1 here aro two ways
of enforcing laws â by legisia ion and by
police force. Legislation with refer
ence to pure food should be on sound
lines. A great many people are opposed
o being legislated, and most legislation
is essentially bad, but the way to do is to
try to make legislation better. There are
three maxims governing theca-e. Aris
totle says: "It is the duty of the State to
reach every worthy end." Private indi
viduals cannot analyze baking powder and
other adulterated food, but the Stale can.
Bees said the professor wouid make
honey out of glucose if it were placed
within their reach. Bogus lood would be
manufactured if there ivas money in it.
Tne Government should take into its own
hands tb,Â£ stamping of foo.is. just as it
stami ed money, for the some reason â that
genuineness micht be officially guaran
teed. In liis youth counteneit State
barsk bills were common. It was one of
his youthful duties to run often through
a bank note de teeter and rina out which
bills were bogus. About one in twenty
was, and very like-ly the counterfeit went
upon the contribution plate. It was nec
essary to have the Governmental because
private enterprise would not act in this
matter.
It would not do to say by law that the
people should not eat plum puJding,
greasy pie or any American pie or drink
steam b;er. Perhaps he might exempt
steam beer from mention â steam beer had
its friends; but the others had none. He
had a right to drink citric acid or eat axle
grease or arsenic if he wished; but let
him know what he was eating. Every
man had a right to a clean patn to the
grave, the same as the man traveling in
ihe other direction; but he was entitled
to know wdat he was about. Government
taternalism would make a nation of chil
dren. Laws coukl not tell what people
should eat or drink, J but could provide
that they should know what they mere
eating or drinking. Shipping frosted or
anges u:ider a Riverside brand was akin
to horsestealing and forgery and murder.
Let .-uch an aci be made to carry unpleas
ant consequences to the responsible party.
Dr. H. b. Bates of San Jose read a pap<r
on "Adulteration." He he] 1 that there
ware many ingenious ways of adulterat
ing tood so as to hurt the human system
and do harm to business.
Dr. H. B. Gates of San Jose read a pa
per on "Adulteration vs. Civilization."
The doctor told the audience about forty
or more ways in whicn foods were
adulterated, and also spoke of the intro
duction of disease germs into the Human
system through milk or other products.
Piolessor M. E. Jaffa of the State Uni
versity discussed "Butter and Cheese."
He strongly indorsed tne new cheese law
as being calculated to encourage the dairy
industry. The pre-ent annual product of
Cahlornia cheese is 9,u00,000 pounds. His
paper was technical and descriptive.
Adulterations of butter and cheese were
severely censured. The iaw, which will
go into effect next Monday, would, he
thought, protect tne producer ot Caiifor
nia cream cheese and insure that the con
aumer would eet a pure article.
Professor of the State Univer
sity spoke on the 'â¢Use of Antiseptics for
tho Preservation of Food Products. " The
real question was what could or could not
be eaten with impunity. Tho effects of
bad food would be fe t in after life, even
if they were not recognized earlier. Pro
fessor Hilgard ridiculed the suiphurin^
of fruits, which destroyed the flavor as
well as the color. He did not blame the
fruit-growers, but the public demand for
lruit ttiat bad been whitened. He had
preached so long in this Slate on the sub
ject that tie had grown tired, and he be
lieved that before to-day he bad never
been applauded for his vit-ws concerning
sulphuring. Unless the law could regu
late the use of antiseptics their use should
be discontinued.
The committee on State and local or
ganization Submitted the following report :
That a permanent organization be
formed, of which the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association of California shall
be the central body, which central organi

suppression ot the manufacture and sale
of adulterated food products in this State
and for the enlorcement of the present
laws of this Slate relating to the suppres
sion of this evil and the brinsing about of
Fuch legislation as will accomplish these
purposes.
f nis report was adopted.
The committee on resolutions reported
on several that had been submitted by
varios delegate?. Some of these, i t was
recom mended, should be referred to a

Chief Food Inspector Dockery read a re
port on the work of the nureau of which
he is the head. He contended that one of
the most perfect milk-inspection systems
in the world had been created in San
Francisco. Beneficial results of the milk
crusaiie were shown by the fact that the
death rate amoni- children under 1 yeur
of age in San Francisco had been de
crea-sed 50 percent. The purpose of the
Board of Health was not to hamner home
producers, but to protect them. The board
had ordered that Eastern brands of goods
should be first exnmined, and this was
done, examinations being made particu
larly of Eastern milks and catsups.
The congress adjourned, to assemble in
May, 1898.
While the congress was in session mem

and Candidate for

Politician.
His Funeral Will Be Conducted by
the Grand Lodge of Masons on
Thursday.
The spirit of Clay Webster Taylor took
its flight at 6 o'clock yesterday morninp.
Few men in California were better
known among tne Masonic fraterniiy, as
also the United Order of Workmen aud in
the councils of the Democratic party than
was C. W. Taylor of Shasta.

TKE LATE CLAY W. TAYLOR.
fornia Irom his native State, Michigan, at
the a.c of 13 years, and soon after gaini ng
his majority became a conspicuous young
man in the northern part of the State,
where he settled, rie'was a lawyer of
marked ability'and was District Attorney
of Shasta County for a number of years.
He srved the State as a Senator from
Shasta and Siskiyou counties in 1882 and
.â -erred through the twenty-fifth and
t\venty-*ixth sessions of the State Legisla
ture. His marked ability as n lawyer and
orator brought him to the notice of the
lending Democrats of the State, and in
1882 the convention which waa held at San
Jo-e put him forward as a candidate lor
nomination. In this tight for standard
bearer he came within one vote of secur
ing the prizttthat fell to Governor Stone
man.
Tne treachery of his party on this occa
sion disgusted him to such an extent tha'
he declined to ever aram allow his nnme
to go before a convention for a State ollice.
A portion of this resolve he, however, re
linouisbed by accepting a place on the
gold Democratic ticket last year as a pres
idential elector.
His career as a Mason was more sue-
cessiul than ttiat of a politician, as he
was elected master of Western Star No. 2,
and in 187 l J the Grand Lodge honored turn
by electing him its senior warden off the
floor, an honor seldom bestowed on an
elective ofÃc r of that distinguished body.
In the succeeding yoar, 1880, he was elect
ed deputy grand master, and in 1881 was
honored by being elected grand worship
ful master of the Grann Lodge of Califor
nia. He was tiD to the time of his death
a prominent member of tho Knights
Templar.
In the United Order of Workmen he was
equally recognized by beinn elected the
grand master workman of that order.
The home of the deceased was at 3364
Twenty-tirst street in this City, wnere he
ciiail, and from which vis mother was
buried about three years ago, and also an
aunt last year. Henrt failure, which
caused his death, had given him consider
able trouble during the t aÂ«t twelve
month', so much so that he chose to re
main in this City with his wife and two
daughters rather than return to the place
where his business was located. He was
aged 52 years at the time of his death.
His funeral will r>e held from the
Masonic Temple on Post street on neit
Thursday at 1:30 o'clock under the
auspices of the Grand Lodge of Masons,
which has been specially convened for
that purpose.

, ' , ; SAN FRANCISCO, CAL.. April 1.1897.
State Electro-Medical Instituteâ Dear Doctor: For years I have been troubled with nervous
debility, suffering terriblyâ mentally as well as physically. I could not sleep nieUts, but would
lay awake brooding over my trouble, always feeling that something torrib'.e was .coing to hap-
pen to me. It is impossible for me to describe the miserable feeling I had. Alter treating a
number of years witii various physicians: I had nearly given up all hope of being a well man
again wneh' I accidentally read one of your advertisements. Alter a very few treatments at
the Institute I realized 'I was being greatly benefited, and to-day there is not a healthier or
happier man anywhere than myself. I feel very greatfnl to you for the interest you -took in .
my case. . ' HERMAN FRANK. Seaman's Institute, San Francisco, Cat ,

Under no circumstances should the Electro-Medical Cure be confounded with the ordinary"
electric treatment us applied by common batteries or with such crude maenetic appliances ai

application and different in effect. ' - v \~ âW *>â ; *

benefits of this wonderful treatment. It is only necessary to write a plain statement of your
condition explaining yoUr feelings and s-raptomsÂ«as clearly us possible, and Jrom it the In-

taken before a Commissioner, who orderel
him deported to China. The Judse of that
district signed the order of the Commissioner,
approving of the judgment. It is claimed by
Kolc's lawyers that the procedines were il
legal, because the act of Mfy 5, 18912, provides
that Chinese unlawfully witnin the I'nited
States mu>t be deported by a United States
Judge. Hence the writ of habeas corpus was
taken out.
Judee Heacock dismissed the writ and re
manded the prisoner into the custody of the
Marshal for deporiation.
Similar writs were obtained for two other
Chinamen found iv Arizona without certifi
cates. The prisoners wiii be brought before
Judge Morrow, who will finally decide the
case.
St. Rose Parish Picnic.
Great preparations are being made for the
annual picnic of St. Rose parish at Shell

pected that the attendance will be very large.
The parish is one of the largest in the City.
Last year, according to the estimate of Father
Nugent, over 2000 people attended the picnic,
ai.d he believes ibai more will attend this
yeiir. Many valuable prizes will be distributed
on admission tickets and to the winners of tha
races and games.

MESSRS. L. LEBENBAUM & CO. (Wholesale Grocers of Sutter street) have obtained a long lease of our TEMPORARY QUARTERS and have notified
us to move out our stock and fixtures by June. Now we're in a worse "pickle" than ever, as we secured these temporary stores so as to unload (at a big
sacrifice) our ' .

We had some assurance and were in hope that we would have at least three or four months' time in which to do it. Now within four weeks after
opening up these commodious salesrooms we are compelled to PACK UP AND GO. BUT WHERE? Heaven only knowsâ we don't, for there ain't
another store in town large enough to hold our Colossal Stocks of Clothing, Hats and Furnishings, which we could possibly lease for a short term.
The Next 30 Days Will Prove a Great Revelation to the Clothiers of This City !
For we shall NOW DUMP OUR FINE GOODS at the feet of the purchasing public at lower prices than any reputable clothing firm on this continent ever
heard of, let alone named. In fact, OUR LOW PRICES for the very highest grade of goods will make the vendors of shoddy draw in their gilded eagle
called "fake reduction" and step out of the arena of would-be competition. Necessity knows no law, and we'll demonstrate it during the pending crisis

FOR DATA.
Resolution to Be I itroluc?d to Change
the Method of Keeping the
Company's Books
Supervisor Clinton, chairmnn of the
Wa'er and Water Supply Committee of
the board, will ask that the present rates
of the Spring Valley Water Company be
reduced 10 per cent when the City fathers
have gained all the information they de
s.re and are ready to act. He thinks that
such a reduction is little enough, and that
he will have a majority of the ooard with
him when the matter comes to the crucial
test of a vote.
Dr. Clinton, however, will not ask that
the cut be horizontal, but that the board
discriminate in favor of t- e small house
holders, who are less able to pay than the
wealthy. lie figures that the 10 par cent
reduction will result in a saving to rate
payers of $178,000 per year, and that
Sli'^'JOO of this should be left in the
jicckets of the owners of one and two
story houses.
The Supervisor has been working on
this proposition lor some time past, and
recently applied to the company for the
amount of income derived by the corpora
tion from vario-us kinds of structures,
raiiging from one story up. This infor
mation is not yet in his hands f-om an
official source, but he has gained data that
indicate that the saving, if it is carried
out, should be aivided as stated.
I>r. Clinton suent yesterday afternoon
with Cyril Williams, the expert of the
br>ard. looking over figures already ob
tained and planning for anothpr visit to
the company's office to get further infor
mation. It was decided that the expert
should go into the books again on Mon
day. If he is successful in his qnest for
the figures wanted Dr. Clinton will in

REMiffOHIZED
Has Been the Practice of Medicine
and Surgery in San Francisco
by Dr. Cook.
THE STORYJJFJUIS SUCCESS.
The Great Specialist Has Made Life Anew to Thousands and Tens
of Thousands Who Had Been Given Up by Other Physi-
cians â His Specialties and Mode of Treatment.
By his skill as a specialist Dcctor Cook
has completely revolutionized the prac-
tice of medicine and surgery in San Fran-
cisco.
Standing to-day, as he doe?, far in ad-
vance of any other physician or medical
institution in the country, his wonderful
success is tne outgrowth of several condi-
tions by which alone what he has done in
San Francisco coaid be accomplished.
First, the qualifications with which na-
ture has endowed him, as*"ev:denced by
his keen perception into the mysteries of
all diseases with which those who apply
to him are afflicted. He is thus enabled
to clearly distinguish the exact character
of the complaint and to conceive the
proper and most effective kind of treat-
ment for its entirecure.
Second, he is wholly devoted to his pro-
fession, having no other desire for achieve-
ment than to make still grander the com-
pete success which he has thus far at-
tained. His great stability of character,

his unceasing study and untiring energy
to accomplish that which he setsout to do,
tot-ether with many more great and noble
qualities which one soon recognizes in
him, all serve to advance him in his mo*t
worthy ambition.
Third, his great advantages of study and
experience in the Jeading and best col-
leges and hospitals in the land, where he
served in all departments, and where Ins
preat natural- ability wrs acknowledged in
all branches as being superior to his quite
worthy biit Jess successful associates, have
all helped to assist him in his work.
Is it any wonder tha , with all these nd-
vahtages in- his favor, natural . ability,
study, experience and a mind devoted to
brs profession, Doctor Cook should have
acJiived his enviable reputation for cur- j

Clinton yesterday, "and I shall ass for
\ that. Water rates should be, in my opin
ion, fixail more to suit the means of the
'â â  citizens than they are at present. A 10
; per rent reduction will save us about
: $178,000.
'If we cut the rates to one and two
â  story houses $128,000 in the aggregate, it
j will mean that owners of these classes of
i buildings will have to pay 75 cents where
i they now pay $1. a savins ul 25 per cent.
1 The remaining $")0, 000 will give the own-
I ers of larger structures a reduction of
i something like 21, percent, which 1 think
j ample, when their ability to pay is taken
â  into consideration.
"The difficulty we have had so far in
\ gaining information lies in the books of

the company what we want, but it seems

"Ibis I think is perfectly permissible,
for the company is in a measure a public

so that the board can act intelligently in

ing distressing and obstinate eases which
bave been given up as incurable?
As yet no case of failure can be discov-
ered against him, and such ability and
sk 11 to combat ami conquer all diseases of
men and women have never before been
demonstrated.
The Doctor's services are of preat value,
and if any one thing be worth more than
anything else it is certainly the services of
a competent and successful physislan and
specialist who never loses sight of a single
case until a cerfect and permanent cure is
effected. Those who are afflicted should
not waste time, money and health dosing
with cheap treatments, cheap medicines
and nostrums.
As a man Dr. Cook is truly upright,
conscientious and charitable, and as a
Dhysician he is thoroughly competent,
earnest and successful, and any and all
persons who may be suffering from any
human ailment whatever will do them-
selves a great injustice if they do not call
upon him, even if their trouble hava re-
sisted all other efforts to cure.
He treats nervous, private and chronic
diseases; blood and skin diseases; female
complaints; kidney, bladder, liver, lung,
t!uoat, stomach and heart diseases; piles,
rupture, hydrocele, varicocele and kindred
troubles without pain or detention from
business. He addresses himself in par-
ticular to young, middle-aged and old
men who are suffering from the awful ef-
fects of early indiscretions, and are thereby
unfitted for study, business or the proper
enjoyment of either married or single
life. In thu distressed condition are
many thousands, who, although origi-
nally strong in body and bright in mind,
have oermitted their ailment to ran on
and on, until finally, with physical and
mental powers exhausted, death claimed
them. The most obstinate cases of tnis
character the doctor treats wiih unfailing
success. All he want* is a fair trial to
convince the most skeptical. He uses no
mercury or other injurious drugs and un-
dertakes no incurabje cases.
A large portion of Dr. Cook's treatment
is by mail. â¢He usually desires at least
one personal visit when convenient to the
patient, but his system of home treat-
ment through correspondence is so nearly
perfect that satisfactory results are always
assured. 'io those- describing their
troubles he sends free of charge his new
and valuable book devoted to nervous and
sexual diseases of men. His address is
865 Market street, Sin Francisco, and his
office hours are- from 9 to 12 a. m.. and
from 2 'o 5 and 7 to 8 p. m., except Sun-
days, when' he may be consulted { from 10

ia Order to B at the New
Dingley Act.
The prevailing northwester has caused a
great deal of trouble along the coast. Yes
terday it was blowing fifty miles an hour
off tue Golden Gate and seventy miles an
hour off Point Rpyes. The Ocean Spray
bound for Fi*!i Rock had to run back to
shelter, while the Coriuthiaa bound for
Bowens Landing los: her flying jib and
had to put back also. The ste:im schooner
Signal \va*also in trouble. While buck
ing the storm herengines broke down and
she had to run bacfc to San Francisco
under sail.
While the steamers and sailing vessels
bound north were "bucking into" the
! storm the handsome new schooner Muriel
â  was making record time witn a cargo of
! sugar from Hawaii. Yesterday morning
i at 2 o'clock she was twenty-seven miles
southwest of the Farallo'nes anl four
' hours later she was at anchor in port.
Fourteen knots an hour is not baa time
' for a sailing vessel. The Muriel has mad â¢
the round trip in tnirty-tive days, thus
, beating the record of the John D. Kpreck
i els, the fastest brig afloat. The fact that
j the Muriel is almost a new vessel and that
â  the John D. has not been on the drydock
j for nearly a year should be taken into
i consideration. Given an equal show it
| should be a nip und tuck race between the
: two vessels.
Captain Carlson of the Muriel again
' succeeded in evading pilotage yesterday.
His schooner outran the pilot- boat, and
in consequence the pilots had not a chance
to speak her. The Muriel has made six
trips to this port, and on four of them
Captain Carlson hss made port without
paying pilotage. When it is kuown that
i the Muriel outsailed the crack piloi-boat
! Bonita it can easily be seen that she is a
! fast boat.
The American steel .Â«hip Dirigo is tak
! ing a long time to reach port. Last Jan
j vary she was spoken off the Horn by the
! British ship Howth, bat has not been
â  heard from since. The Howth is now in
i port, but no word has been received from
the Dirigo.
The only cause for uneasiness is the fact
that the Dirigo has twice been docked on
account of leaks. When she was here on
her last trip she ha<i to go on the dry
dock to have seme of her bolts in the hull
overhauled. Later she went to Japan
with a cargo of oil and made the return
[ trip in the fast st time on record. She
a^ain was leaking, however, and again
was put on the drydock. Siie is now on
her way to San Francisco with a General
cargo. Sho sailed ten days ahead of the
Charmer, now in poet, while the captain
of the Howth is anxiously awaiting her
arrival in order to win a new hat which
he bet on the ran when off Cape Horn.
The ferries Were overcrowded yesterday
morning. Mayday brought picnickers
! lrom ah parts of the town and from 8
| a. M. until noon all the steamers were
crowded. Over 2000 people went to St.
Peiers pnrinb picnic at El Campo, while
lully 18u0 went toSchuetzen Park with the
members of St. Francis parish.
The members of the Turn Verein also
went to Schueizen, while the South End
Boating Club went to Guerneville. All
the excursionists had a most enjoyable
time.
The trnmp steamer Homer has at last
found a definite place to run to. She has
been put on the route between here and
Astoria, and will in future run opposition
to the Alice Blanchard. A regular rate
war is now in order and people will be
j able to send freight to Oregon in a few
i day-i for $1 a ton, while the passengers
may be earned for nothing, with a meal
ticket ttirown in.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company is
I also in the cut-rate war. When the Japa
i nesoputthe Hakusan Maru on the route
from Yokohama here the Mail Company
at once chartered the British tramp Glena
voti and Uld her at the same whari as the
Hakusan Maiu. Both vessels are crowded
with carso, as ail the merchants in the
Orient who have connections in the
United States are anxious to get their
goods here before the Diugley act goes into
effect.
The old tug Wizard has seen her last
days. Her encines are to be taken out
and then the hull will be consicned to tne
boneyard. Many a gooo. haul did Captain
RandaH, now of; the Monticello, make on
i er, and on the deck of the old Wizard
Captain Clem Randall, now of the Fear
less, learned all he know* about tugboat
ing. Captain George Harvey, assistant
manaser of ihe Shipowners' and Mer
chants'Towboat Company, also handled
( her, â : while Captain Grey, the general
superintendent, has a warm corner in his
heart for the old-timer. For almost twen
ty-live years the Wizard has been a prom
inent factor in shijping; circles, and now
she has to go on tne retired list.
The British ship Qlencaird got in from
Liverpool yesterday. (jn April 29, in lat
itude 35.44 north, longitude 125 12 west, a
large spar which looke l like a ship's lower
mast was passei. It loosed very bright
and the general impression is that it was
one of the sprtrs of the missing Sauaria.
The following notice to ship captains
has been issued by the Branch Hydro
graphic Office:
Forecast of wind and weather in the North
Pacific oc -an for Mayâ During the month of
May, the sun being well north of the equator,
the wind and weather incy b3 expected to un
dergo marked changes in several parts of the
ocean.
The northeast trade winds east of the Ha
waiian [stands will t>e found with an average
force oi four or five (Beaufort scale), varying in
direction irom northeast lo cust-northeast, and
with northern limit near the thirtieth parallel.
To the west of the Hawaiian I-lnnds, in the vi
cinity of the twentieth parallel, they will
probably be from the east. Near the Amtri
c.m coast, within the Undo wind iimiis,
northerly and northwesterly winds may be
expected instead of northeasterly winds. The
southern limit of the nonneast and northern
Mint of the southeast trades will be found
further north than during April. In tne
doldrums or calm region between the tradei
much ruin and frequent thunder-storms may
be rxoected, accompanied by calm*, light
variable winds or squills. A moderate amount
of fog may t>j expected nlong the coast of the
United States. Occasional thunder-storms
may be expected along the coast of Central
America.
OVer the Aleutian Islands will be found an
almost permanent low of considerable depth.
The general circulation of the winds around
this low is as;Kiii!-t the sun. In the zone be
tween 35 and 50 deereet N. frequent moderate
westerly ga.es may be expected, accompanied
by rain, and nor lii of 45 degrees N. latitude
with occasional hail and snow. These gules
may be expected, however, to be less frequent
as compared with last month. Out of a large
number of observations 20 per cent give Â»
force of wind of (> above, and 9 per cent of
force 7 and above (Beaufort scale), as against
27 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively, for
the month of April. In this region occasional
f Of? may also be expected.
Occis.onal spiial circulations, viz.: the
cyclonic (against the sun), with low barom
eter, and anti-cyclonic (with the sun). With
high barometer, also cross this region.
As a consequence of the changes in meteoro
logical conditions over Asia during this sea
son we may expect to find the northeast mon
soon dying out, it being interrup ed with
variable winds and calms until the southwest
monsoon sets in steadily along the southeast
coast, ot Asia toward the end of the month.
This monsoon brings the wet season with it,
and not, sultry and rainy weather may be ex
pected.
Fog, mist and rain will be prevalent about
the Japan island* and coast of China, and fre
quent squalls and thunder-storms may be ex
ptcted in the- vicinity of the Philippine Isl
and*.
The United States gunboats Marietta
and Wheeling are nearing completion,
and each one will be ready for her trial
b-fore the middle of May. The Marietta
is now on the drydock having her twin
screws affixed, and when she is completed
the Wheeling will take her place. Cap
tain C. Miner Goodall will be in command
when the Marietta has her trial, and will
also command the Wheeling later on.
The water-logged schooner Elvenia has
been towed to Oakland Creeir, and

HOGS STILL THERE.
Mission Five-Mile Improvement Club
II:m Matin Its Influence Felt
at the City Hall.
Mission Five-mile Improvement Club,
with its headquarters at LiÃuri Hall, can
be congratulated by the residents of the
Excelsior Homestead section for the pro
gressive spirit manifested by its members
since its organization. The officers of the
clubâ Dr. E. N. Torello president, H.E.
D >yal vice-president, M. H. I*vy secre
tary, F. J. Gilfeather financial secretary,
and It. Cereghino, treasurer â have con
tinuously labored with the City authorities
for the betterment of this section.
Tnose gentlemen, with the executive
committeeâ R. Enzelin, I. Herzog, E.
Lewis and William Losgermannâ left no
stone unturned to fully and fairly repre
sent the wants of the iaruilies which have
choaen this place for t eir homes.
It has been demonstrated that the
cattle-runs Â»Â»nd hogpens can be much
better utilized by having schoolhouses
and happy frolicking children occupy the
brow of the sun burned southern bills than
by permitting it to remain unproductive,
as it has been during tne past forty years.
TLis spirit of progress has, however,
been fought to such an extent as to call
for an official visit from the (Supervisors,
which body sent out a delegation, com
posed of Supervisors Haskins, Devany,
Delany, Lackman and Morton, on last
Friday to hear both sides of the question
as to the adv.sability of oxtendine the
pound limits.
At present one man insists on keeping a
pen of fourteen "grunters" on Crook
street in defiance of all protests to the
contrary.
The influence of the club hits succeeded
in obtaining a promise from t..e School
Directors that an eight-class brick build
ing shall be erected upon tb.9 present site
of the Monroe School building.
This much accomplished the club next
wants additional eiectric lights through
the district, together with a better supply
of water and lire prolection.

SOCIALISTS KEEP
LABOR DAY HOLY
Speeches by Members of
the Socialist Labor
Party.
Policemen Denounced for Inter
fering With Their Street
Meetings.
Ex-Populist Wilkins Explans Why
Hj Left the People's Party
Last Year.
International Libor day was celebrated
by the Socialist Labor party in Metropoli
tan Hall last evening with exeicises ap
propriate to the occasion. The seats on
the main floor were filled, and the gallery
had a fair share of men and women wear
ing tbe scarlet ribbon.
For attempting to break up the Socialist
street meetings and for arresting tne
driver of the SDCialist advertising wagon
yesterday forenoon, the police came in for
some bard verbal knocks.
Nearly every one in the audience wore
the Bcariet ribbon, while the red flag
drooped from one corner of the gallery,
and the American flag from the other cor
ner.
Chairman Andrew' s opening speech
was brief and not startling, but, on the
other hand, a little vague, as most
speeches on the same subject are. He
said :
Citizens of the world: I address you thus,
for no country can own you. Each socialist
can siy iv his heart: "Tne world s my coun
try; to do good is my religion." Nobody can
teli what there i 6 in store for us if we wouid
behave as we ought to behave if we wouM use
the means at our disposal to me best of our
knowledge. Men, women and children are re
joicing ail over the world tc-day, and hoping
again*, hope sometimes.
Wijiie some rejoice, others are slaughtering
each other over nothing, lor whether the
Turks or the Greeks prevail it will matter but
little; whether Spain or Cuba shall prevail it
will matter scarcely anything Sor me prole
tariat, 'ihere will still be the same condition
and position for the wage-worker with noth
ing lo hope for.
utut we expect to gain is to point out some
thing that caunot be described in words;
something which the whole world is lookiug
for and has not yet been found, and that is
the true civilization. Yet no man, woman or
Child is to-day what they snould be. Every
Socialist should be devoted to the whole
truth and j-catter hope and joy wherever you
can; nut vim and vigor into them. Never
say fail; never give up. if there is anything
on behalf of the oppressed that you have at
heart.
We have good reason to rejoice. The evi
dence of our progress is satisfactory to our
minis. D.m't lose ai:y opportunity of doing
good on our lines. Abore nil each individual
Ktiow.ii cultivate interuallv as well as exter
nally all the graces of manhood and woman
hood.
Miss Jane A. Roulston read a paper. It
was also in the sail minor key, and,
womanlike, filled with reproach -s. She
spoke wistfully of the beauty of the May
time. It wa3 made for all, but a few men
walked the earth and prouily boosted
"This fair land is ours." Her speech
voiced the cry for nature, for the green
fields, the fragrant flowers and the blue
unsullied skies. It was a protest against
factory walls, "the crowded alleys of the
town' and the smoke-begrimed city.
E. T. Kingsley made a speech in which
EVERY MAN HIS OWN DOCTOR
Is just what many men would like to see come to pass.
These men are discouraged with doctors. They go to a
big, highly recommended doctor and he fails to do them
good; then they try another; after a while they come to
think doctors a poor lot of men, and wish for some cer-
tain remedy or treatment that will cure them. To
these men a fair proposition is here offered. Ten thou-
sand living, hardy men testify in black and white that
they were cured by a remedy-treatment called HUD-
YAN. Many of these men never expected to hold up
their faces again and look squarely into the eyes of their
fellow-being. One man actually wrote:
I am troubled with dizzy spells. Sometimes I get them when lam
standing ; at other times when I lay down ; everything whirls about me.
I am troubled with pains in the small of my back and pains up each side
of the backbone to the lower points of the shoulder-blade. These pains
are not permanent They come every now and again. lam troubled
with pains in the headâ left side. 1 have dots, dots, dots before my
eyes; then I get real dizzy. My heart palpitates. It seems as if the
blood rushes through my heart too rapidly, and it exhausts me. lam
also troubled with what I may call nervous pulsations through the body.
My sleep is not good. My head is hot and stuffy. I have a curious
weak feeling in the morning. lam in despair.
That man was treated with the HUDYAN remedy-
treatment, and he is now a strong, vigorous man. There
are 10,000 of just such men â strong men, with the vim
and bounce and brace and tight powerful strength.
These men are no longer weak, premature creatures;
they are men and can be seen. They are willing to tes-
tify, and have done so. These men say HUDYAN is a
good treatment. These menâ lo,ooo of themâ are cured.
Do you want to be cured? If you do, consult Hudson
Doctors free, or write for Circulars and Testimonials.

he made several uncomplimentary allu

night.
M. W. Wilkin* 1 , one of the delegates to
the People's party National convention at
St. Louis, and author of a large oart of tne
Omaha platform, made the speech of tue
evening. He was a middle-of-the-road
man, and when the Populists nominated
Bryan he made up his mind to join the
Socialist Labor party.
He said that a millionaire and agent of
the Southern Pacific Company went into

and logrolled lor the indorsement of
Bryan and Sewall, and he became: con

We hear cf merchants who keep goods two, five and even ten years in stock
without finding a customer or reducing the price to meet the market. We have not
so learned trade. Everything must go at our price or at your rjrice, or at some price.
We call this selling for storage,, and put something in the place that will sell at a
profit. We do not get "picked up" on one lot in SCOO, but occasionally we find it
necessary to meet a loss, and always meet it cheerlullyâ the public is the gainer.

WONDERS NEVER
CEASE IN RACING
Little Bob Took the Ingle
side Stake at Four
Miles.
Marcel, Assuredly the Eest,
Second Through Tardy
Riding.
Can't Dance, the Favorite, Was Un
placedâA Big Crow* Viewed the
Raceâ Three Choices Won.
The racing season at the local track wm
brought to a close yesterday with the
Ingleside stake over a distance of four
miles as the special attraction of the card.
If rue spirits of those departed turf he
roesâ Thad Stevens, True Blue, Foster
and Hock Hockincâ were hovering about
they must have found it difficult to re
press a smile as they gazeu at the five
entries lined up to do battle for the rich
J4QOO prize. They were thoroughbreds, to
be sure, but what a mediocre lot. Little
Bob, the winner, has in the past been run
ning in cheap selling races, entered to be
â¢old for a song. Three parts of his com
position is grit, the other portion horse.
He pulled up lame and bleeding slightly
at the mouth, and probably won a fortu
nate race, for Marcel was undoubtedly the
best of the starters, and but for an error
in judgment on the part of her rider, Mike
Hennessy, would undoubtedly have car
ried the iSpreckels red, wnite and blue to
the fore.
As in the past, the race bad the effect of
drawing a big crowd to Ingrleside. The
fair sex was well represented in the grand
stand as well as over the balconies of the
clubhouse, and the old-timers were mar
shaled in full force. The big race was
tiown on the programme to be decided
fifth, but was run off fourth. A strong
breeze was blowing over the course and
everybody was predicting slow time, and
were treated to a surprise.
The preliminary warming up gallops
were auxiousiy watched. -Shortly after
betting began, in cuming through the
stretch, Wawuna engaged in a heated
argument with a harrow, and canie out of
it with a shoulder resembling a quarter of
beef hanging in front of one uf the City
markets.
He was excused by the judges and
twenty minutes a.lawed lor a near book.
Can't Dance >uited the critics' eye, and
opening at 8 to 5 his price was soon cut to
3to 2. Scnilier, which opened a 6 to 5
favorite, receded to threes. Although the
stable did not fancy the chances of Mar
cel, the cr'>wd did, playing him down
from 6to 4^' to 1. Lucrezia Borgia with
little Woods up and 92 pounds, was
:baiu.mered from 12 down to 7. Litt:e
Bub' was stationary in the betting aiS
_io L .
.There was no delay at the start. Woods
on'Ludrezia Boreia at once went out in
front, trailed by Schiller and Little Bob,
â wrnc-n'was the order of the leaders for ihe
lirat mile:
. For., the "next two miles Little Bob was
thenunner up. Parsing the stand for the
last mTle-'Lucrezia was Jeadin Bob by over
a {.ength, witn Schiller and Can't Dance
peads apart- and Murcel galloping in last
position, two length* away. On nearly
equal jepm's Little Hob inhered over three
jurlongs from home and it looked as
thoughÂ»_he hart tendered his resignation,
but^ hÂ°e passed the Brutus filly in the
stretch, and on sheer camenosj led the
tfi'rdy coming .Marcel past the .winning
line by three lengtns in 7:2-JlÂ£, ten sec
onds laster than the time made by Cad
mus wlien he defeated Pepper for the
sa'mn staKe one year ago. Lucrezia Bor
gia was third, with the pumped-out favor
ite fourth.
Little Clawson rode the winner to Â«â¢
cellent advantage, and besides receiving a
well-merited ovation was presented with
an order for a theater box from the judges'
stand -by the well-known minstrei and
spon admirer, William West.

away over the result of the stake race
that the books must have quit away
ahead on the day's betting.
Of the original fifteen entries in the j
four and one-half furlong scramble for i
two-year-olds eight faced the webbing.
Rosormonde, with Willie Martin up, was
b pronounced 6 to 5 choice, and, taking i
the lead soon after the start, made all the I
running and won easily from Salabar, the j
second choice. The latter was di-quaiitied j
for swerving, thus giving Flushington the j
place and Castuke the show.
The talent was at sea as to the probable i
winner of the six-furlone run next de
cided.^ At po^t timft fours were obtainable !
against either Mollie R. orinip. Disparity.
Two Cheers, with Johnny Weber op,
nearly turned the trick, leading the big
ounch until past the paddock, where he
was passed by both Aiazan and Mollie R,
the first named winning by half a length,
with Two Cheers in the show, tne same
distance behind Mollie. Bergen managed
to get imp. Disparity away from the post

favorite Reddington, which, with Stan

down Jrom Tuxedo, with Arundel in the
show.
The sixth race was declared off and a
four and a halt furlong spin for maiden
two-year-olds substituted. It was easily
captured by Towanda, which receded
from 8 to 5 to 13 to sin the betting. Truth

NOTES.
Rnbe Clarke was presented with an ele
gant gold cane yesterday by the employes
of the bar.
"Butch" Fisher is said to have offered
Little Bob for sale yesterday morning,
setting the price at $590. "Butch" likes
to be numbered among the wise division,
and it mifrht have been a bluff to get 100
to 1 against the gelding. However, that
is more than he is actually worth.
Had Mike Hennessy made his move
with Mai eel on entering the backstretch
the last time, instead ot waiting until the
far turu was reached, the mare would
have won without much difficulty. Wait
ing to make a spurt with a horse that is
not a sprinter was very poor judgment.
The officials of the two racing associa
tions met at InglesicJe yesterday and de
cided to close the racing season at the end
of the coming meeting at Oakland.
The real tru" winter racing form so much-
Jy mentioned by opponents of a prolonga
tion of racing was vividly illustrated yes
terday, but as the horse's owner is a mem
ber of the Mitide Western Division, which
controls the racing ai Ingleside, the "re
versal was overlooked. On April 27.
Tulare, with 109 pounds in the saddle^
won a mile dash in I:42}^ very cleverly.
Yesterday with 99 pounds up he was not
one, two, t!ireÂ« in a mile taken 'by Ban
Marco in 1:42%.
It is said that Candor lacks gam eness.
It looked very much yesterda3' as though
speed was the essential quality he fails to
possess.
When the handicapper put 157 Dounds
on Reddincron he evidently thought all
the crack jumpers in the country were
entered. It was a very pretty presenta
tion and a speech should have gone
with it.
After two miles had been covered it is
said little Woods, who piloted Lucrezia
Borgia, lost the full use of his arms from
cramps. The form book would nave many
different tales to tell if this same affliction
overcame ri.iers in shorter distances run.

George E. Lask, Sta^e Manager.
A few days before the production of
"Shamua O'Brien" at the Tivoli, the fore
going notice was posted on the stage door
to the ereat "disgruntlement" of the
artists concerned. Many oi the male sing
ers boasted beautiful mustaches, and
these had to be sacrificed to art. Rhys
Thomas' dainty lip-shadow, Eugene Dan
ton's BoulangÂ»r beard, Adam A. Stock
meyer'B Napoleonic whiskers went the
way of last year's snows.
However, the exigencies of art combined
with the success of "Shamus O'Brien"
prevailed over personal pride and all the
cast appear on the stage strictly inline
with the period of 1798, when smooth
faces and ciose-cropped hair were the
fashion.

No. 10, N. S. G. W., had in charge an out
door celebration, specially arranged for
the day. In consequence the Sutter and
Sntro street railways on the one hand and
the Haight-street line to the Chutes did
i a big business all the afternoon and even
ing carrying the people first one way and
ttion the other.
The crowd was so great at the Sutro
bftths os to almost entirely occupy the
entire seating capacity, while great num
bers lounged about the railings down by
the water.
The water itself was alive with bathers,
who during the dances crowded tne plat
forms in their scant bathing suits, watch
ing the exhibition.
The entertainment began at 2 o'clock,
when a bevy of children, young girls and
boys, advertised to number 1000, but who
fell short of that number very materially,
joined in the raising of two May poles.
Thechilren occupied a stage erected
above the water in about the center of the
area. Between that and the galleries oc
cupied by tiie spectators was the stand
provided for the band. The children,
dressed in gay colors and fancy costumes,
were at first banked upon seats arranged
in tiers. At the signal from the conductor
and the music of the band, they sprang to
their places and raised all hands about the
two May pole-, presenting a very spirited
picture, heightened Dy the splash of divers
anil swirairers in the water.
The programme following consisted of a
great variety of fancy dances in which
from a single individual to several iiozÂ»n
tooK part and wh'ch held the big audi
ence well entertained and applauding
each performance through tUe long after
noon. Mr. Sutro, after one of the dances,
was called to the platform and was pre
sented by a young Miss, on behalf of the
dancers, witli a beautiful bunch of flowers.
Mr. Sutro made what was no doubt an
appropriate response, but no word of which
could be heard by the distant audience.
The audience, however, applauded just
the sum?.
The crowds that filled all the available
space and which took in all the main and
si-le shows at the Chutes were equally en
tertained. The prrgramme included a
number of outdoor sport?, a potato race,
a bailoon ascension and other attractions,
in the evening winding up with a grand
ball.

" I can do the work of two men now.
My eyes are bright, my thoughts clear

Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
It is a modern remedy. It is new. It
is grand in its work. Its cures are mar-

with electricity while you sleep. Electricity is lif?. It awr :ens the dormant nerves
and makes manhood complete and overpowering. Much more could be said. Let

ON RELIGION
The Sufcj ct Discussed in
Every Dstail at Yes
terday's Congress.
Eloquently- and Ably Treated
by Many Interesting
Speakers
Tbe Final Sewiosr of the EoJy Will
Convene at Galden Gat v Hill
f This Evening.
It was religious day in Ihe Woman's
Congress. The subject of religion was
discussed in- every detail. The gamut of
the deliberations covered the whole range
of the spiritual aud emotional side of
human nature. - ...
There was no advocacy of any creed
beyond a broad tribute to the orthodox
Christianity, in all its various sects and
aspects..
The morning was devoted to a business
meeting of the executive board, from
which visitors" were exclude i.
Miss Cora Miilicent Palmer had plenty
of hearers when she opened the delibera
tions of the. Congress in the afternoon
with a paper entitled "Shall we teach re
ligion?" After a tribute to the part re
ligion played in advancing the cause of
civilization, Miss Palmer said:
Education is the instruction of the intellect
in trie laws of nature. The ideals of the high
est education .cannot be attained without a
recognition of rehgiop: The truly educated
ma:i is a. religious man, ai;d religion of the
intuitive sort is cot sufficient. The whole of
the man is to receive development in the vast
education, and a. man ca mot be left to intui
tion in religion any mere than he can in the
siu<2y of botany "or -in the development of
morals. â  Not the least weighty reason for
teaching religion is that the religious faculty
is developed just .as are all other mental facul
ties. The.- religious -life of the individual
witnom-education is sure to fall short and to
result possibly in an absurdity. Colleges and
universities are. criticized lor unfaith simply
because .the young men- ana women students
"have never had an adequate religious train
ing in 'faith of their f.ithers and have re
garded their peculiar â  D-d feeble religious im
pressions with the acute.judgment of a mature
mind.' . ' ."â -; _'_,
Mine. . Lvdia Maneroff yon Finkel
stein, in commenting:. upon Miss Palmer's
words,' said there was a' woeful lack of
re-lh-ioivi condition. â¢
"The B-ible.is lull of great truths if we
will only understand them, ' said the

Miss Maude A. Green of Stanford Uni
versity lollbwed with, a i>aper ou "Music
as Â»n Element in Religioaa Culture."
Music was defined' by Mi^s Green as a
sort of universal language or emotion. Its i
mnge of iwelnlnMS- was unlimited. It i
was the most cosmopolitan oi the arts, j
The.cause of the church was assisted by
iti majestic harmonies of praise. It was
a.n essential factor in the .development of j
life. Miss Green w-o-ulu make melody a ,
common heritace ana advocated open-air
concerts for the poor, ShÂ« drplored the |
lack of tysCeiu at present in church nntsic.
Rabbi Nieto, in ariticiznc the paper, |
declared the influence of music in religious j
worship was overrated. In religion there !
shoufd be jess of impulse and more of
calm reverence and veneration.
Rev. \V. A. Brewer of St. Mathew's
School,- San Maleo, discussed "Religion in
Home and Schools." After dweliine on
die growth of the. educational system Rev.
Mr. Brewer said: â  â¢; m
Our attitude as regards the teaching of re
ligion In public schools if; I think, an Ignor
ing one. Tne man who appoints the teacher
avoids the religious issue to avoid getting into
hot water, aua the teachers take their cue
likewise.
' As regarding the petition of the great mass
of Americans, who would huve tue Lord's
prayer Tecited in our public schools, I would
say 10 (hem that there-is no mandatory attri
butesin religion.' 1 woul i not teacn religion
by act of Congress. Thai is the way the Turk
would do it.
But our schools should not, full into the
ha-ndsof the- irreiigious. Irreligion must not
>>: taught in our >chopis at any rate. AlaÂ«,
i hut religion is not taught is our public schools.
The advocates of compulsion are wanu.ering
from thfir own stFoagnold. They declare the
public school is the keystone oi our Republic,
fsavno- Thehorae is the tiibric upon which
oar Nation 'lf founded/.lt is thero religion
bhouid be first taught.
Our present school system .is probably the
beat under oSf present political and social
condition*. I regret to 'guy that the differ
rrces between our-reiigions nre to no small
extent responsible for rlie present lamentaMe
tonditioM of affairs. There are some possible
to.utious. Private" denominational school*
â¢ have been ebtablished "and are increasing in
â numbtrf. By no "means must mere beany
arbitrary action. \Vhen a religious body will
not permit its-ehildrt n -to attend the public
schtjolg m a God-fearing' community, Â»re we
not justified in doubting if that body has
true Christian vitality?
l.pl<Ed then with the", mothers. Whence do
your children get tbtnr religion? In the Sun
day-school or iv the liomeV There v apareu- 1
till priesthood as well as a. priesthood of the
church. It is tin religious home that ia to
soive the question ot religion in our public
schools. When the school will become au in
tegrul part of our home life.
At the evening session the discussion of
i religion was resumed. The Brama
charin was the first speaker of the even
ing and his subject was "Relicion as a
i Synonym for Education." He held that
j religion stood for enlightenment, ana cul
i ture and education.
Rev. William R. Alger followed, his
subject being "Christianity, Truly Inter
preted, the Only Religion," and Rev.
George C. Adams concluding tbe di-cus
sion with "The Religious Basis the Only
True One for Education."
The hall was crowded, and the speakers
were warmly upplaudod as each con
cluded.
Miss Maude A. Green sang, a collection
was taken up and the announcement was
made that one of the most interesting
sessions would be held this evening, clos
ing the congress for this year.
It is understood that some caustic refer
ence will be made to the refusal of the
First Congregational Churcn people to
all w the congress to be held in the church.
The programme for thi3 evening is:
"The Main Strength of the Species," by
Miss Ray Frank; "Morals in Education,' 1
Miss El za D. Keith; "The Joys of San

Mark Elliott's Experiences in
the African Mines and
With Natives.
Mart L. Elliott, the well-known Cali
fornia mining man, formerly, connects
with the superintendencyof the Keystone
Arnador, Pittsburg, Grass Valley am
other mines, has arrived hereafter fou
years and a half in South Africa.
When he left here he went to Johannes
burg and took the management of the
Champ dOr, George Gocii and other
properties. Eventually he went toMastion
aland for the Salisbury Reef Gold Min
ing Company, and remained there nearly
two years. During that time he acquired
large interests in good mines. The mines
are seventeen miies from Salisbury. This
is away in the interior of Mashonaland,
and it took considerable energy to push
forward there.
On June 20 last while Mr. Elliott and
hia few associates were at tbe mines the
outbreak of the Mashonas occurred. Tne
Mashonai are desperate fighters and Mr.
Elliott and his men saw that they had
best try and make their way at once to I
Salisbury. The natives adopted the same
tactics in fighting as tne American In
dians. They concealed themselves along ;
ihe trail and picked off their victims as
they passed.
For ten miles of the fourteen there was
hot fighting. The blacks hid in the tall
grass and kept up :i vicious tirini;. They
nad the latent Martini and oiher improved
rifles. However, thpy thought that by
raising the sights of tlie guns they could
shoot with more deauJy force, and because
ul this tLey in many instanrfts Â«hot ov,er
the heads of tho minerÂ«. Mr. Elliott and
all the men â were we.l armed and they
rained the buUets right and left on the
natives wherever they saw them. A num
ber were killed, Mr. Elliott himself fetch
ing down one native in plain view who
had prown despernte and rushed ai him
with an assegai. Mr. Elliott is not an ad
mirer of the natives.

a day for hearing grievances ot men, and j
that as each came and stated his case no I
was asked what money compensation
would atone for his misfortune, and in
every case promptly wrote a ctie-jk for the
amount. Sometimes he doubled it. In
nearly every case the men were total
Strangers to him and none of them had
the slightest claims on him. That day he
must have given away folly $50,000.
"While in Boath Africa 1 visited the
Fcenes and saw a number of Hie heroes of

Elhott. "Allan Quartermain, the hero of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 2, 1897.
ARMY OFFICERS
STUDY THE SIGNS
What the Compulsory Re
tirement of Colonel Bain
bridge Signifies.
Immediate'PromotioQ of Lieuten*
ant-Colonei Miles Depends on
Sbafter's Confirmation.
Should Mies Become Co'cnel of the
First Infantry He Would Prob
ably Command at the Presidio.
The retirement of Colonel Edmanrt C.
Bainbridge, Third Artillery, by order of
the President, and the death of Colonel
Horace Jewett, Twenty-first Infantry,
caused much comment in military circles
of San Francisco yesterday. Colonel
Bainbridge was ordered from St. Augus-
COLONEL EDMUND C BAINBRIDGE, Third United States
Artillery, Retired.
tine. Fin., last fall, when the Third was
brought here to relieve the Fifth Artil
lery. The colonel is a Virginian by birth.
He was born in I*3~>, but was appointed
from New York as a cadet to tue United
States Military Academy at West Point
July 1, 1852. He graduated July 1, 18oG.
He served mainly in the Third, Fourth
and Fifth regiments of Artiliery and was
breveted for faithful and meritorious ser
vices during the war.
When Colonel Bainbridge was ordered
to California with his regiment it was sur
mised that he would succeed General Gra
ham as commander of the |icst at the
Presidio, but otner arrangements were
j made at headquarters in Wasuinsrton, so
: that Colonel Shafter cnrae to the Presidio
I wiih the headquarters of the First In
fantry, and Colonel Bainbrid^e established
headquarters of the Third Artillery at
An^ei Island.
It was stated in telegrams from Wash
ington that Colonel Bain bridge has out
lived his u&efulress as an army officer, and
therefore the President --zeroised the
executive prerogative of retiring him at the
ajje ol G2. Tne colonel has the reputation
in the army of preserving discipline and
efficiency in nis regiment. As a post com
i mander, be manages to adjust in an easy
manner the little differences and discords
tbat frequently vex a garrison.
Army officers interpret the signals from
Washington as meaning that the adminis
tration will find others available for retire
ment. It is not fancied that Colonel Bain
bridge was singled out, but on the other
hand it is construed that room is to be
made for the advancement of younger
army officers.
Colonel Bainbridge's retirement will
promote to the gr.uie of colonel Lieuten
ant-Colonel Marcus P. Miller, now at St.
Augustine in command of the First
Artillery. It does not follow that Miller
will come to Angel Island.
lie will probably exchange with Colonel
Royal T. Frank, now colonel of the First
Artillery Regiment, but on duty at the
Artillery School. Colonel Frank will no
doubt stay at the scuool until he reaches
the age of retirement, which is not far
distant. It will make no difference to him
whether he is colonel of the First or the
Third, but it will maku a great difference
to Colonel Miller. The latter was com
pelled to make one expansive move re
cently from New York to Florida, ana
therefore would have a right to use ail the
proper influence available to obviate an
other costly transfer from Florida to Cali
fornia.
Should the exchance of Miller and
Frank take place, Lieutenant-Colonel E i
ward B. Williston, now stationed at the
Presidio, would succeed to ihe command
of the Third Artiliery. I' does not follow,
however, that Colonel Williston must
establish regimental headquarters at Angel
Island.
The death of Colonel Horace Jewett at
Plattsburg Barracks day before yesterdny
has made anothe r vacancy in the infan
try. Lieutenant-Coionel Klein, now of
the Ninth Infantry, will be promoted
coionel and assigned to the command of
the Twenty-first Infantry, the regiment
which Jewett commanded.
bliould the Senate confirm ike appoint
ment of Colonel William Pv. Shatter to be
brieadier-generat at the session to-mor
row, or at any time before another infan
try vacancy occurs, Lieutenant-Colonel
Evan Miles, now ai Benicia, would |be
come colonel of the First Infantry. He is
npxt in line after Lieutenant-Colonel
Klein. The chances are greatly in favor
of Colonel Miles becoming commander of
the post at the Presidio.
There may be some cavalry vacancies
before long. Colonel Mills of the Third
and Colonel Mizner of the Tenth have re
spectively attained the ace ol 62 years.
Coloael bumner of the Seventh will be C 2
next Aueust.
Mark Hanna is said to have a friend in
the cavalry â Lieutenant-Colonel Henry of
the Third. Several retirements, com
pulsory or elective, would give eaeles to
Lieutenant-Colonel Henry and put him in
line for a star.
On the Bth inst. Mnjor-General Frank
Wheaton will attain the retiring age of 64.
He was appointed major-general but a
month ago. The President has a group
of good brisadiers from which the major
general's vacancy may be filled. Brooke
is the senior brigadier.
In the emiy it is said that Brigadier-
General Coppinger aspires to be major
general, but the opinion is expressed that
he received the full measure of his doserts
when President Cleveland made him a
brigadier- general. President Harrison
once flatly refused to nominate Coppin
ger, although importuned to do so by Mr 3.
James G. Blame. the colonel's mother-in*
law.
The story goes in army circles that
Cardinal Gibbons requested President
Cleveland to make the appointment, and
in connection with the request some war
reminiscences were introduced. The fact
was recited that President Lincoln per
suaded Henry Ward Beecher and Arch-
bishop Hue hen to visit Europe during the
war and present the Union side of the
conflict to foreign countries Mr. Beecher
confined his efforts to EnÂ«land, while
Archbishop .nughes visited Catholic
countries As a result of the latter's visit
five officers of the Papal Guard cast their
fortune* with the Union army. Of these
five Coppingfr is the only survivor;
O'Keefe'and Moore were killed during the
war; Kelioo of the Seventh Cavalry was
slain in the Cu3ter massacre, and Ber
trand died after the war closed. As Cop
pinger was the only one living President
Cleveland decided to promote him.

Thomson and District Deputy Frank Law

tion aud it was acted upon favorably.
There are new banners in the lodgcrooms and

H?alth 0 ficer.
Oakland Office San Pbascisoo Call,)
908 Uroadway, May 1. \
There is no loncer a lady on the Oak
land Board of Health. This afternoon
Mayor Thomas named Li 9 three new ap
pointees and tlie complexion of the board
was changed from homeopatnic to allo
pathic.
As soon as the new board took office
it quickly proceeded to make a com
plete change, with one exception, in the
patronatre within its cift.
llie Mayor's appointees are: Dr. George
L, Eaton, Dr. U. E. Brinckerhoffer and
]>r. H. N. Ructer, who. with Dr. Cham
berlain and Dr. Small, now compose the
entire board. The three members who re-
DR. J. P. DUNN, New Health Officer oi Oakland.
tired are: Drs. Sarah Shuey, Beckwithand
Larkey.
When the board mat this afternoon no
time was wasted. T-iie retiring members
introduced their successors into their
seats, and after a few pleasant words
Secretary Paul Bcfaflffer was called upon
to perform the mo?* unpleasant act of his
who.c term of office. He was asked to
read somt resolutions that had been
already prepared.
The first one declared the office of
Health Officer vacant, and at the same
tinre elected Dr. J. P. H. Dunn to the
office.
The r.ext little resolution wa= very per
sonal to the secretary. It declared his
ntllce to be vacant, and aprointed 11. K.
Snow, who has be?n expert, to j;rand
juries, to be his successor.
Then there was a lull and the lobby
wondered what was to be the f.ue of the
sanitary inspector, Samuel Smith. He
wap, however, the only lucky one of the
lot-arid retained hi- job.
Tlien can-.e .another resolution declaring
the place of assistant Â«ani;ary inspector,
held by Mr. Ot:, to he vacant, and ap
pointing E. <i. Perkins to his place. The
fast resolution-* was somewhat of a sur
rrise, as it was not known that the veter
inary surgeon wan to be cnanged. The
place of Dr. F. E. Pierce, however, was de
clared to be vacant, ami Dr. Stiruson was
named as his successor.
Dr. Dunn, the new Health Officer, tiled
the same position from. IWI to 18S3 and
is a partner of Dr. E. H. Woolsey. He is
a Native Son, had., been connected with
.the university .faculty as chemistry in
structor, and is the. surgeon for the Fifth
Kepimeht r N. G. C.
Dr. Brirtckeitioff was. elected, presioent
oT the board, and named the following

HEBREWS ADOPT REFORM
Congregation Beth Israe' Has
Adopei Radical
Changes.
T<Â»Day's S rvice Will Be Conducted
Half in Englreb and Half in the
Hebrew L3ii7ua?e.
â  Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
- ~ 90& Broadway, May 1. f
For over two years important changes
have.gradually heeh introduced into the
Jewish ritual used in this city. It has
now resulted in the adoption by the First
HeÃrew "CofjereÃation of radical changes,
placing that powerful organization firmly
in. the ranks cf what is known as the re
form element in distinction from the or
thodox element.
This change was first mooted by Rabbi
Friedlander over a year ago, and at the
timÂ« threatened to bring about' much un
pleasantness" in the Congregation Beth
Israel,. After much consultation a ' por
tion of his plans was -adopted, and some
parts of the ritual which had hitherto
been usy?d in Hetfrew were read in Eng
lish. This was rendered : necessary be
cause it was found thai many Jewish chil- |
â¢dren. attended the public schools where I
the" Hebrew language is not taught, and J

couM not intelligently follow the ritual in
the language of their creed.
Very gradually the feeling toward adopt'
iiift the reform prayerbook has strength
ened, ami at the last meeting it was de
cided to commence at once the changes
adopted.
At the Congregation Beth Jacob Rabbi
Linczer some time ago started a school in
his synagogue for teaching the youneer
members the Hebrew language. His
views differ in many respects from those
of Rabbi Friedlander, and he believes that
instead of substituting Englisti for He
brew more attention should be given
to the study of ti-.eir own language.
The trustees of Dr. Friedlandorlg con
gregation were opposed to the t-uunges
just introduced, but now that the reform
movement has become general in many of
the largest congregations of the country
they are perfectly in harmony wttn their
rabbi, and the Congregation Beth Israel
since removing their synugogue to its new
site has j.ronres-ed rapidly.

LIVELY BASKET BALL,
Blood Flows ia a Game at
the Harmon Gymnasium,
Berkeley.
A Spirited Contest Between Berkeley
and S-n Francisco Young
Ladies-
BERKELEY, Cal., May I.â Blood
flowed in a girls' basket-ball game in the
Harmon Gymnasium to-day, and now
devotees of looibill have an answer to
those who love to speak of the brutality of
the gridiron. The same was between the
teams of Miss Head's school of Berkeley
and Miss West's of San Francisco and re
sulted in a victory for the latter on a foul
by a score of 3 to 2.
The playing was sharp and swift and
the audience â composed exclusively of
ladies, with the single exception of Pro
fessor Magee, who acted as timekeeperâ
showed much excitement.
In the second half Miss Edna Burke,
the captain of the Berkeley team, re
ceived a Bevere blow on the nose. Blood
flowed freely, and it was thought lor a
time that the young lady's nose was
broken. She retired fiom the game for
medical attention, and an examination of
her injury was made by Professor Magee,
who found that a bad braise was all the
damage that had been done.
Play was resumed, the young ladies
contending for the glory of their respect
ive school with great vigor. Miss Kobin
son of the university basket-ball team
acted as referee.
A large delegation from San Francisco
came, to witness the contest, and all the
jflrls of Miss Head's school were present.
The auQience made as much noise as
would be creditable to a mixed-college
audience, and outside the building a crowd
of men enjoyed themselves listening to
the leminine cheers, yells and hisses.

TWO DROWNED
IN THE LAKE
Sons of Ex-Judge Nusbau
mer and E. M. Hall
Lost in Oakland.
Searching Parties Dragging for
the Bodies of the
Boys.

Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call, I
908 Broadway, May 1. f
The young sons of es-Jiulge.Nusuaumer
and E. M. Hall were drowned in Lake
M rriu this evening.
This afternoon two of the Hall lad 3 nnd
young Nus ba timer, together with Victor
Olyer, hired a bout anl went out on the
lake, intending to bathe. They rowed out
to near the Newton property that was re
cently filled in near Fourth avenue ami
after taking off their cotlu's they went
into the water. Noue of the lads could
swim, but as they found only a couple of
feet of water near them they wandered
around and paid no attention to the
depth.
Near where the lads were bathing the
dredger was at work some months ago
pumping sUckons into the Newton prop
erty. A great deal of this work was done
also in connection with the filling in of
the land back of the boulevard, and this
of course made large Oeep holes all over
that section of the lake. These holes have
not tilled in, as there is no current at that
corner of the lake.
The boys knew nothing about this and
paddied around ahead of the boat, while
Hiram Hall and Victor O.yer remained in
the boat.
Suddenly Ei Hall and Emil Nusbau
mer disappeared. Hiram jumped out of
the boat and swam to where the boys had
disappeared. As they came up Hiram
grabbed his brother Ed, buc the latter was
cxci.cd and took a firm hold of Hiram*
feet and dragged him under the water.
While this was happening Victor Oiyer
rowed the boat up to where the boys were,
and as they came up he took Hiram by
the hair, and ai he had freed lumsel from
the grasp of Ed, Victor succeeded in pull
iau Hiram into the boat.
Young Emil Nushaumer was not seen at
all aiter he .-.aiik, and Ed Hall wouid not
have risen at all but for the efforts of
Hiram. As soon as Victor pot Hiram into
the boat tbe latter became unconscious,
I and fearing that he too might be suffering
j fatally from his immersion Oiyer rowel
i him ashore, and on the way to his home
| lie fainted again. He tried to make, his
j way to the rooni of his grandfather,
Hiram Tubbs, who is gradually failing,
but this was prevented and he fainieu
a. am, bat is not in danger.
As soon as the news was made known
several parties started to dredge the lake,
but found nothing. County Clerk Jor
| dan took charge of one party and Thomas
| Kennedy, the old boatman, assumed con
; troi of another. They worked tiil half
past 11 to-night, but, although five boai
loads of people and a diver were at work,
they found nothing ana abandoned work
j until 4:30 o'clock to-morrow morning.
] The searcners have decided to eiDlode
| dynamite cartridges the first thing in the
: morning to try and raise the bodies.
Â£d Hall is 13 years of ace and is a grand
| son of Hiram Tuobs. The old capitalist
is very low to-night and the fearful news
is being kept from him. He lives with
) tbe Halls in the old homestead and was
I very devoted to the lads. 6upreme Justice
j Henshaw is young Hall's uncle, Emil
Nusbaumer is 12 years of a c and is the
son of ex-Judge Emil Nusbaumer.
The news of tbe tragedy created the
greatest excitement in town on account
of the prominence of the bereaved fami
lies.

Oakla>d Office Â£an Francisco Call,)
(K)8 Broadway, May 1. f
Principal MeChesney uppeared in a new
role to-day. He constituted himself a
committee of one on espionage and
guarded the stairway leading to the gym
nasium of the high school.
One of the most exciting games of
bnsket-ball between young ladies played
in ibis city was that this morning be-
tween the girli of the Oakland High
School and a visiting team, called the
"Castellejos," from Stanford. They are
young ladies connected with one of the
preparatory schools of the Stanford Uni
vers ty.
The girls' gymnasium at the high school
was once tne subject of much unpieasant
publicity, which was entirely undeserved
and wbicti Principal McChesney deter
mined should never occur again if he
cou'd help it.
When the basket-ball mate!) was ar
ranged the principal personally super
vised the list of invitations, so that no
man or boy in disguise could Do^sioiy be a
spectator. Nut satisfied with tbis, he
took up his position early this morning at
the entrance to the stairway which leads
to the gymnasium and himself carefully
inspected every invitation presented.
Male reporters only got up two step*
when the principal's outstre'<c >ed arm
prevented them from going any further,
and it is safe to say tbat during the whole
time that busket-ball match was being
played there was not a single ruale on the
topmost floor of the hisrh school.
The Oakland young iadies proved more
than a match for the Stanford girls, and
succeeded in capturing the game by a
score of 6to 3. The Oakland team was
composer) of Winifred Morgan (captain),
Alice Ferno, Emma Sooer (forwards),
Catherine Cavnnaueh, Delia West, Ethel
Cattun (centers), JaqiteKtM Moore, Mary
Shafier imd Hannah Hampton (etiarda)
The Castellejos were Bessie French,
captain; Grace Ross, Cleo Srurceon, for
ward.s; Eulnvella Sweetland, VidaDueker,
Mary Giiman, centers; lone Ross, Olive
Anderson, Jessie Downing, guards.
Miss C. E. Palmer, the pbvsical culture
teacher of the high schoo , was in charge,
and although the young ladies never in
dulged in horse play there was a eood
deal of very live y girl piay. The services
ot Miss Crawford, the referee, were fre
quently needed, but her decisions were in
every case accepted without dispute.
One of the features of a baskei-ball game
is certainly the yelling which is indulged
in by the p ayers and their supporters.
During this morning's game the cheers
and shouts from the gymnasium could be
heard on the other side of Lafayette Park.
The Oakland giris ohose blue for their
favorite color, and many of them had
lodk streamers of bine ribbon tied on little
sucks, which they waved frantically, and
found no difficulty in overcoming the
noise made by the visitors from Palo Alto.

BLUE AND GOLD
ABOVE CARDINAL
Berkeley Wins the 1897
Series of Baseball Games
From Stanford.
Palo Alto Men Prevented From
Carrying Away the Silver
Trophy.
Hard Hitting:, Plenty of Fools, Nine
Lost Balls and a Swell Crowd
F atures of the Day.
Berkeley scored a mighty victory
against Stanford yesterday afternoon on
the baseball diamond, thus winning the
series of intercollegiate games for the sea-#
son of 1807. The blue and gold Btanaard
bearers marched off the field of battle to
the tune of 20 to 10 against the cardinal.
It was simply a walk-over. The U. 0.
players bad the Palo Alto nine on the run
from the very start. Not one-half of the
excitement and interest in the game pre
vailed as in their last game together, or
even in the first of the series this season.
Berkeley's superior batting and field work
was a feature which manifested itself
early in the play, and it was kept up until
the scorer put down the last ran.
The U. C. aggregation found Beckett, ,
the Stanford pitcher, right away, and hit
him so hard and fast that in the fifth
innin? the cardinal sent Ruddell to the
box. Tnoug > wild for an inning or so,
Ruddeil got down to business and began
striking th â¢ Berkeley men out one after
another. It was generally remarked that,
the Palo Alto boys would have come out
b tier had iluddell been given the ball at
the start. .
Jeff?, Stanford's catcher, seemed to be
able to pull in anything that came within
speaking distance.
Wheeler and Kaarsburg, Berkeley s bat
tery, continued throughout the nine in
n nes to play steady ball.
The four stars which shone most
brightly in Berkeley's firmament were
Hoag, Hennessey, Krug ami Captain E -
ston. Krng knocked two Mission-street
fieldersâ the only two of the day, and by
so doing brought in. altogether, four men.
It was a harvest day for the small boy.
Not less than nine . balls, representing
$11 25, went went over some one of the
lour fences about the grounds never to
return. The crowd was a good sized and
a swell one, but almost too swell to do
much "rooting." 'â  " * ' ' ' '
it was a great victory for Berkeley, foe
had not the day been won by the blue
and gold Stanford would have been enti
tled to the coveted silver trophy now in
possession of the university club which
is to go to the university first winning
rive games. As it turned out Berkeley
I still .las a show for the trophy. Stanford
has won four of the series and Berkeley
but one. ; - iv-.

Frank P. Slaving the Australian heavy

Merchand and Rivers, directors of thÂ« Pa

with some friends, he was driven to his
training quarters near the Cliff House. *
"This is my first trip to San Francisco,"
said Slavin, "and I think that the climate
will agree with me first-class. It is a year
ago since I left England for this country,
and although I have always been ready to
meet any of the heavy-weights, I found it
,to be no easy task to tret on a match." *â â â¢â â

a six-round contest, which was xecently
"pulled off" in P. us burg.
When a-ked what he thought of Smith
Slavin smiled and said: ''They are all
the same to me. 1 bar neither height,
weight nor color; tint come first served
ha- always been my motto.
"Yes, I KUea* ttus fellow Smith must be
a pretty hard name," he continued. *'I
understand that ne gÂ«ve Maier a hard
argument, bot you can't always tell what
kind ot condition pugilists are in when
they â¢ fijtit li-mi ted- round battles. I ex
pected to find this big nigger Armstrong
here. I would like a chance at that fellow
in this City. 1 have jus. learned that the
â¢Parson's' big boy could not get oti a
match. Well, he can get one f ram me any
timr â that is when I am out of an engage
ment."
Slavin snoke of bis fights in England
briefly. He said tuat his hardest battle
was against Peter Jackson and that it was
the colored man'> remarkable cleverness
that savrd him iroru defeat.
"I ihou.'ht I could whin Jackson han
dily," said Slavin. "but you know with us
pugilists we can't always count upon a
victory. Jackson was a great man then,
but dissipation has wrecked his great
constitution completely and I doubt if he
can train for a ten-round go now. Of
course Charlie Mitchell is a pretty old
stag himself, and I guess a contest be
tween the two would end in horse and
bone.
"The Eastern sports do not think much
of Sharkey. In fact they look upon tun
sailor as being a good thing for Peter
Maher; but then, the sailor may outlast
the Irishman."
Slavin's la*t fight was against the col
ored pugilist Robinson in Syracuse, N. V.,
whom Slavin whipped in two rounds.
Slavin is 33 years old, stands 6 feet 1 inch
in heigi t and fights at 186 pounds. He
says that he feels tagf as good as he has
ever felt and is always ready to si^n arti
cles of agreement to fight men of any
color when good financial inducements
are offered. He will remain at his train-
Ing quarters until the tight is pulled off.
Smith, his next opponent, has left tha
East for this City.

WHY BUY SUGAR FOR ISLAND
COOLIES ?
James Coffin of tbe A ameda Sugar
Company P.eads for United States
ManufacturiiK Interests
James Coffin, the secretary of the Ala
rr.eda Sugar Company, has prepared a
statement of facts regarding the present
condition of the suear trade, and presents
his side-of the Hawaiian treaty question
as follows:
Th? ".Alameda Sugar Company," an associa- |
tlon of sixty-five American stockholders, with j
a paid-up capital of $600,000, begs to present j
the following plea: Last year we manirfac
tared 4700 tons refined sugar from 3500 acres, ;
grown by 228 different farmers. This year we i
expect 9000 tons refine i sugar from 6600
acres grown by.4300 different farmers.
From tne -Hawaiian Islands, under the
falsely called reciprocity treaty, there came j
in free of duty lssi year 227,000 tons of sugar.
This equals the product of twenty-five such j
factories as ours. These 227,000 tons dU- j
placed the most profitable product of 105,000
acres of land, and robbsd 10,750 American
farmers of their mosu profitable crop.
The manual labor which these 10,750
American farmers would have employed in
the intensive farming which the cultivation
of the sugar beet requires is still another con
sideration.
The factory labor yet another.
To refine a ton o-f duty-free Hawaiian sugar
requires the labor of oue man for one and a
third days. To grow from the soil up and j
manufacture one ton of reriued sugar requires i
the labor of one man for thirty-eight days.
This 227.000 tons of Hawaiian duty-free
sugar yearly displaces in money value:
For factory 1ab0r....... $1,135 000
For farm labor Â«na rentals 9.000,000
For limestone 400.000
For coal 1,500.000
For other supplies...... 650 000
The iabor of allied industries, foundries,
jute and cotton mills, etc., remains still to be
reckoned on, and all thiÂ« native labor dis
placed that a coolie-made contract-labor prod
uct may thrive in a foreign island.
The three localities In California where the
three beet-sugar factories are already estab
lished are the only really prosperous agri
cultural communi-ties in that Ftate to-lay.
Domestic exports to Hawaii in 1895 were
not so large as in 1883; less by nearly one
million dollars than in 1890 ana less by over
a million and a quarter than In 1891.
1883 9 3,683,000
JHPO 4,606,000
lfPl 4,936.000
Ih9'2 3,781.000
1895 3,648,000
In 18959-6 the value of Hawaiian sugar im
ported was over $19. 000,000, upon which the
duty at 40 per cent would havp been $7,
--600,000.
For the sake of maintaining a foreign com
merce of $3,648,000 and in order thac a few
shipping houses oi Sun Francisco may benefit
Dy the trade and k^eep c ontrol of the large
cash balances of Hawaiian planters the na
tion at large must give up $7,600, 000 of rev
enue.
For the sake that coolies may work in a
foreigu climate which white labor cannot
stand and wTiere the white and dominant race
forms about 3 per cent only of the popula
tion, the laboring men of San Frar cisco now
parade its streets calling for work and a
'.haritabloluud aggregating $'.!5,000 is daily
published in its newspapers and is now being
disbursed to an idle crowd who clamor for the
tickets doled out to them in the order of ap
plication and which entitle each to a day's
work at $1 per day upon an unnecessary
boulevard.
Should. a Coxey army aeain march on Wash
ington and class ever be arrayed against class
in our fair country it will be because home
labor is denied a ri-ght to work for its own
market in order th*t foreigu coolie labor may
add to the 'wealth of a class ootv actively at
work to Influence National legislation In the
perpetaati .>n of their privileges.
The local agents of Hawaiian planters, with
out any possible accruing benefit to them
selves and as mere retaliation against the
producer of native sugar, are to-day so un

patriotic as to be collecting figures from na
tive California sugar factories in order to pro
duce them at Washington and support their
claim that native sugur needs no protection.
Whereas up to January 1, 1807. tbey knew
that the "Alameda Sugar Company" had since
1889 paid out in dividends $130,000 and re
ceived in bounty $226,744 93.
Showing a loss without bounty of $90,
--744 93.
CunJitioned upon favorable legislation,
iviihin two years the 75,000 ton; oi sugnr
need d on the Pacific Coast would be en
tire.y m>!<te from the native product, and not
a pound of this Hawaiian sugar would be re
quired to supply the coast consumption.
The opposition to tariff legislation has
always contended that tariffs were designed
to aid manufacturers, trusts aud the moneyed
class generally.
The abrO2ation of the Hawaiian treaty is
respectfully Â«sked in the interest of the agri
cultural class and of native labor.
For the purpose of diverting attention from
the main question of protecting the California
farmer and the investments of American
cepital in an American industry the advocates
of the continuance of Hawaiian reciprocity
.have recently begun the use 01 uart of the Cal
ifornia press in appealing to the prejudices of
people on 'he ground of ar. admission that
Clnus Spreckels had sold a minority interest
in his two beet-sugar factories to the Ameri
can Sugar Trust. While this fact may be re
garded by many as a misfortune, the facts re
main that there other sugarles uncontrolled
by the sugar trust, and the development ot the
industry on so large a scale will tend to the
permaDent benefit of the depressed agricul
tural interests of the State.
Let the example of California in the matter
of beet sugar be imitated by the different
btat * along the northern and temperate belt
of our country, and the multiplicity of fac
tories wou'.d make the control of the industry
by any concentrated power a commercial im
possibility.
DIAMOND BURGLABS.
Johnson and IJlack Discharged on
Habraq Corpus and Rrttrrosted.
Edward Johnson and John Black, who
burglarized a jewelry store in British
Columbia and stole $5030 worth of dia
monds, appeared in Judge Carroll Cook's
court yesterday morning on a writ of
habeas corpus.
The point was made on their behalf
that they could not legally be held under
the provisions of the extradition treaty
unless the warrant for their arrest was
swoin out in a United States court or in a
State court of record.
An inspection of the papers showed that
the warrant ior the arrest of the prisoners
was issued out of the Police Court of this
C.ty, which is not a court of record.
Judge Cook held that the point was
well taken and ordered the discharge of
ttie prisoners. Th-y were at once re
arrested, however, ou a warrant granted
ui.der the seal of the Superior Court.
Judge Cook announced that he would
grant the defendants an examination to
morrow to determine the question as to
whether they had committed an extra
ditable offense.

the Affairs of the
Ashleys.
Emma Preparing to Make Her Debut
in a Ben fit P.Tformanca for
Her S stor.
Unusnal sympathy appears to have
been excited in certain quarters in the
affairs of the Ashley sisters and little
Beatrice Anita Ashiey. Two applications
for the adoption of the interesting iittle
tot have been made to Emma Ashley, the
aunt, who has taken charge of the child
pending her mother's recovery of her
heal to.
The aunt, however, will not allow the
child to go out of her charge, as she fears,
she says, that "Lucky" Baldwin may se
cure possessiou of the child, and arrange
matters so that Beatrice will not be in
position to lay claim to any part of
Baldwin's estate after hiÂ» death.
Some unknown person yesterday sent
Mrs. Woodman, the lady with whom Emma
Ashley and her niece are stopping, a clip
ping from a Placerville paper, which
stated thnt Baldwin was stopping at tne
Ohio Hotel of that town. ThiÂ« does not
accord the report given out here by
the millionaire. When he left this City
he stated he was going to Randsburg.
Lilian Ashley underwent an operation
at St. Luke's Hospital yesterday, and the
prospects are now good for her complete
restoration to health iv three or four
weeks.
Meanwhile Emma is busy, under tho
tutorship of Mr-. Carrie Clark Ward, pre
paring for her histrionic debut. She ex
pect- to make her first appearance in one
or two weeks from next Saturday, At
that lime an afternoon and evening-per
formance will be given for the benefit of
Lilian. Baby Beatrice will be in evidence
at both performances. MrÂ«. Ward is of
the opinion that Emma Ashley has great
natural aptitude for the stage and will
make a talented and successful actress.
Miss Ashley is under contract with Mrs.
Ward to afterward appear in Oaklaud and
lo make a tour of the State.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 2, 1897.
TWO PICNICS AND
TWO GOOD TIMES
St. Francis' Held at Schuet
zen Park and St. Peter's
at El Campo.
The Exciting Boatracs Between
Fathers P. C. Yorke and
J. McDonald.
How Father Caraher Threw the Stone.
The Two Charleys' Dancing
Featsâ O'Neil's Sword.
"Three cheers for Father Caraher and
the parishioners of St. Francis."
It was just as a vast crowd was jostline
and elbowing one another to board the
train at Schuetzen Park for this City that
the foregoing words were shouted by some
leather-lunged youth, and the response
that greeted them was deafening.
It was a great picnic and reunion; there
can be no gainsaying that, for the old
t mers vouch for it There were fully 3000
people there, ail good-natured and out for
a good time, and they had it. By the time
the second trainload arrived everything
was in full swing, and the games began.
It was laugh, laugh, laugn, from their
inception to the end. John Laney of
truck 2, San Francisco Fire Department,
led off in the list of winners by taking the
prize in the fat men's race. Lahey was a
foxy runner, even if fat, and iairly rolled
over the tape as foremost man by the
great margin of six inches.
Special Officer Charles Deuier carried off
the married men's race, though the slow
est of the bunch. His success was due to
the fact that he was the only man out of
.-even that didn't fall two or three times.
George Kendall, the milkman, threw
the heavy stone the farthest and took the
prize. Father Caraber picked it up, but
as it was so much lighter than the one
witu which he tTiuniphed last year he
dropped it again with the good-humored
comment that he could not afford to sac
rifice his reputation by engaeing in chil
dren's sports.
The young men's race was won by
FranK King; the hop, step and jump by
Frank Lynch; the three-legged race by
Herman Hover and William Schieber;
the race for boys under 10 by Paul Me-
Sweeney, and for boys under 14 by John
Kelly.
Police Officer Lloyd's wife simDiy rivaled
Atalanta in the fallacies' race, and danced
a jubilee at the close to show the dyna
mic energy of which her muscles were yet
capable.
The young ladies' race was well earned
by Miss Mamie long, and to Miss Annie
McDonald â T. Burns acting as judi-eâ
went the prize for the most beautiful
young lady. Burns' competency todeciile
in this respect hss never been questioned.
The iropby for the best jig and reel
dancers was" taken by Michael O'Brien
and Mrs. Sheehan. But t!.e greatest crowd
assemoled about the platform where Mrs.
Blood, aged 75 years, took the floor with a
young fellow and fairly "hoed it down"
till the fiddler cried quits.
A spirited contest look place as to whom
should be awarded the handsome sword
donated by Captain P. Connors. Compe
tition was limited to Company M, L. C. C.
Lieutenant E. O'Neil was the lucky youth,
With 364 votes, and Private Hunt second,
with -!O4 ballots. Many were scattering.
Games of all kinds were indulged in by
the young folks all day. Father Giles
took them under his wing, and himself
was to be found most of the day in a
swing.
Dancing was kept np during all the
afternoon and until the last train was
ready for departure. Young Charles Gor
man of Company M distinguished him
self by dancing with the tallest young
lady on the grounds. She was over 6 feet
tali, and little Charley scarcely 5. Every
body stopped dancing to witness the fun,
when his partner entered into the spirit
of the thing and waltzed round the room
holding him at arm's length off the floor.
Charley McCarthy, the American ship
per, and his lriend, William McCarthy,
neither of whom knew one step from tbe
other, were persuaded to get on the floor
togetiier, and the effort was so exhaust
ing that both refused to sine their famous
duet, "Wait for the Wagon," for which
they had been programmed ty the com
mittee.
Late in the afternoon James Kitterman
and wife gave a banquet to the clergy in
one of the ivy-wreatlied arbors. Many
others aUo partook of tbeir hospitality.
Taken all in all it was a most satisfac
tory reunion of the parishioners, and
much praise is due the priests of the pai
ish and the vnrious committees for their
unrelaxing efforts to make it so. The
committee? in charge were as follows:
General Picnic Committeeâ P. A. Buckley

The parishioners of St. Peter's enjoyed
an outing and pirnic at El Campo yester
day. About 1500 people were present,
ami the day was enjoyably spent in games
of various Kinds, contests of strength aud
skill and dancing.
Everything passed off pleasantly and
there were no incidents of any kind to
mar the day's pleasure. The nearest
thins to one, however, was in order when
Fathers P. C. Yorke and James McDonald
engaged in a boat race.
That is, they rowed into each other at
right angies across the bows of each other's
boat, wi h one oar fanning half the time,
and for dear life all the time. At the close,
the boats wer* tanzled un, and no decision
was given. But the coast record was
within thirty minutes of being lowered
just the same.
The race for altar boys was won by John
Giifoy. Arthur Swan carried off second
prize.
M. Barrett won the fat man's race, be
cause the course wai too narrow to allow
anybody to pass him. T. E. Wadswortti
ciime in second, holding on to Barrett's
suspenders with a death-grip.
Mrs. D. E. Meyer won the fat ladies'
race and the prize, but was shylocked em
of live pounds weight, by Old Sol in so
doincr. Mrs. Robinson got the second
prize.
Tue other races, with the winners, were
as follows: '

BRIDE OF A DAY
ATTEMPTS SUICIDE
Jeanette Daisy Thornton
Swallows Chloro
form.
A Relative Told Her That Her
Husband Had a Wile in
Chicago.
Thornton Denied the Accusation eni
Was So Excited That He Fj!l Into
a Hypnotic Trance.
Jeanette Daisy Thornton, the bride of a
day, attempted to commit suicide last
evening by swallowing a dose of chloro
form.
H. N. Thornton, who says he is a doctor
of science, was married Friday night to
Jeanette Daisy Powell, of 956 Folsom
street. Thornton is about 28 years of age,
and his bride 22.
They are both spiritualists, and the
ceremony was performed by F. P. Evans,
the regularly ordained representative of
the spiritualists.
Tue newly-married couple went to live
at the Manchester House, 44 Sixth street,
and everything gave promise of a bright
future for the happy bride.
Yesterday afternoon she called at her
former home, 95G Folsom street, and her
brother-in-law was present. In trie course
of conversation her brother-in-law ex
pressed liis sorrow for her, and, on being
pressed for an explanation, he told her
that lier husband was a bigamist, as ho
had a wife living in Chicago.
The shock was a terrible one to tne
young wile, and after she recovered she
hurried 10 the Alanchester House. Her
husband and a friend, P. A. Baker, were
chatting as she entered. She immedi
ately charged Thornton with blighting
her life. He was amazed and wanted to
know what she meant.
She told him to go to his wife in Chi
cago, and stepping to the bureau uncorked
a small bottle of chloroform and swallowed
the contents before either Thornton or
Baker divined her intentions.
Thornton rushed out of the bouse for a
physician, who was soon on the scene, and
by applying the usual remedies saved her
life.
As soon as his wife was pronounced out
of danger Thornton went to !Â»oG Folsom
street to demand an explanation from his
wife's brother-in-law. He was in such an
excited state that he fell into a hypnotic
trance, and in alarm his mother-in-law
notified the police and Thornton was
driven 10 the Receiving Hospital in the
patrol-wagon.
Dr. Fitzgibbon did all he could for him
and put him to bed. He soon recovered
conciousness and was allowed to go home.
He gave an emphatic denial to the
statement that he has a wife in Chicago
and could not understand why his wife's
brother-in-law should circulate such a re
port.

DEEP LIES
GOLD IN THE
OLD GWIN
Rich Strike at Great Depth
in This Famous
Mine.
WAS ABANDONED FOR A
GENERATION.
California Enterprise Pumped
It Out, Dug Down and
Found Wealth.
LARGEST BOIY OF PAY ORE IN
THE STATE.
This Strike at Fifteen Hundred Feet
Mans a Good Deal to the
Mother Lode.
They have struck it rich in the old
Gwin mine of Calaveras County, four and
a half miles southwest of Mokelumne
Hill, by going deep into the bowels of the
mother lode. Now Senator Voorheis of
Sutter Creek, Assemblyman Thomas Bel
shaw, F. F. Ihumas and Siewart McClura
of Oakland will be richer than they ever
expected to be.
This strike is a new and significant evi
dence that wealth lies deeper in the
mother lode than has been believed.
Advices from Senator Voorheia testify
thai the find is "rich." It lies in the big
gest known ore body, or pay chute, yet
found in California. The story of the
Gwin mine is the story of the Champion,
Providence and other great moiher-lode
minpsoi the present, in that it was worked
extensively a generation ago and then
abandoned as unprofitable until men with
money and confidence came along, dug
deeper and found wealth. Many years ago
it was owned principally by ihe late Sen
ator Gwin of Broderic* duel fame, and
while he operated it it yielded a fortune.
In those days mining machinery was
not so efficient as now, methods were less
perfect and the cost ot operations was
greater in all directions. The water was
an expensive impediment, and when at
the lowest level reached the value
of the ore was consumed by the
cost of getting out the gold opera
tions were suspended. It joined the
great group of silent, worked-out mines
that have dotted the mother lode so long
to be recently reopened.
Its idleness lasted sixteen years, though
its owners held to it for its known value as
a property that might be profitably de
veloped. Two years or so ago F. F.
Thomas, a capable mining man, Senator
E. C. Voorheis, Thomas Belshaw and
Stewart McClure, son of Dr. McClure of
Oakland, bonded the mine for $200,0110 and
proceeded to develop it.
In doing so they spent money. A new
shaft was sunk to a depth of 15U0 feet at a
cost of $100,000, and a 40-stamp mill was
erected, the total investment being about
$150,000. Drifts were run and it was early
discovered that below the old workings
the great ore body increased its length to
1300 feet, being there 200 feet longer than
it had before been found to be.
Milling operations were got fairly going
late last fall and since then work has been
vigorously prosecuted. Work haa re
cently been pushed mainly in the 1300 anil
1400 levels and stoping and upraising have
been going on in ail directions. A few
uays ago a dividend of $6000, the rirst In a
great many years, was paid, and now
comes the discovery that the mine is
richer than ever.
The Gwin mine is another evidence of
the new confidence of California mining
men in deep mining. It is gratifying, too,
to know that this luck has come to Cali
fornia men as a reward of California en
terprise.

DECIDES THE FUTURE FATE
OF WOMEN CONGRESSES
J. F. ENGLISH, Senior Class, Lowell High School.
Left for Women to Do.
From time immetDorial woman has constituted the refining influence of the
world. Since this is so, why should not the educated and intelligent women of
to-day assemble for the. purpose of brinjrin? the world to a higher moral standard?
. Men have seemed unable to bring about a pure, moral and social condition of the human race, and
have apparently left it to Eve's daughters. From the commencement of these congresses women have
hoped, toiled and waited for higher things. All acknowledge that some gooi has been secured, perhaps
>t in words but in action. Cannot we see something very encouraging in the increasing influence of
these Congres-es? How many homes and schools have been stimulated by the subject under considera
tion! Women have been brougnt to a true conception of the:r duty in life, and have come to a knowl
rj7.li worth. A Japanese proverosaya: "A sn:>Â«rior -woman eiaits her husband ;an inferior
degrades him." R. E. GRACIER. Senior Class Girls' Hign School.
The Woman's Coneress aims at the broadening of women, making them think outside of the dreary
round of jots and pans. Anything that brings onÂ« human soul into touch with the higher and the
nobler is surely worthy of praise. How much more praiseworthy then is this congress!
But two evils lie close at hand, which, however, may be checked, or perhaps prevented by the indivi
dual members and the association. In the first place these gatherings may open a gap between husband
and wife. The uplifting of women should not be bought at such a price. Partisanship also may render
this an association for propagating certain doctrines instead of a deciding and deliberative assembly. But
happily these evils are preventable by carelu! progression.
MONROE E. DEUTSCH, Lowell High School, middle class.
The modern position of women was inaugurated by trie revolution of 1848, which asserted the
human rights of individuals. Crossing the Atlantic, the wave of revolution found the political rights
of men already fairly secured, aDd the restriction remaining upon universal manhood being slight, the
force of the wave expended itself upon the legal, social and political disabilities of women. The \ur
pose of the Woman's Congress is to lay a^ide these disabilities; to advance the cause of woman and to
raise her to a position where her rights will be respected â to place her upon an equality with man.
The problem offered by this comprehensive institution is to 'how why. in a representative system
based on the double principle that all the intelligence of the state shall be enlisted for its welfare, and
all the weakness of the state b- represented for its own defense, women, being often intelligent, often
weak, and always persons of the community, should not also be represented.
It is to consider these and other problems that the learned of the Staie have met at this fourth an
nual session of the Woman's Conpress. ALICE V. CASAMAJOU, Polytechnic High.
Unfortunately, my opinion on the merits of the Woman's Congress are but in embryonic form.
Devoted to study, opportunities for reflection, and consequently for definitely molded opinions on .-such
a mighty subject, nave been denied to me. Nevertheless, I feel that there is a something hidden
w thin me that sympathizes with the stand tasen by our women on this occasion and for Jour
years past. Their aims are high and exalted ones. They themselves embody the noblest
and most elevated' qualities of humanity â disinterested efforts to raise the
standard of their fe>ow-3isters, tinse'tishness In the disbursement of their
â superior talents to that <nd, and, greatest of all, the incentive ihat prompts them
-'- the cause of humanity' and justice. Yes, they are subject to errors, but we
must be generous in our critic. sm.
I say th#n that as a tody we may depend upon it when such women as
.- jsan B. Anthony or Anna Shaw present themselves at a Woman's Consres-s.

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 2, 1897.
In view of the Woman's Congresses that are being held it would seem eminently advisable that before trying to formulate
a definite opinion at the present time we ascertain what the future generation thinks of them. For, wbatever is the verdict
of the women of to-day who are holding the congresses, it is improbable that any radical change in social anil political condi
tions for which they are talking will be brought about by it. It will be the verd.ct of the next generation that will effect the
change, if any change there shall be. Manifestly the influence of the congress women who are now with us and diligently
audible will go far to frame the opinions of the impressionable youth who nre to foilow in their footsteps. But it is none
the less a fact that each cycle of time developes a new independence, and the men and women of to-morrow, although influ
enced by the men and women of to-day, will by no means be wholly directed by them.
The Call has realized the advisability of having the coming generation's views of the movement at hand, and has
gone to the pains of securing representative expressions thereof. The three public high schools of San Francisco were vis
ited tbis week, and from a competitive submission of views from the pupils of the various classes one representative view
from each class has been obtained and is here presented. These expressions are those of the very flower of San Francisco
youth â a youth that is already at the threshold of maturity ; and while the opinion may be said to be in a somewhat in
cipient state, it is quite likely that subsequent and maturer contemplation of the question discussed will not materially alter
then. Hence this may be taken as a fairly accurate forecast of the fate of woman's cause at the hands of those who will,

What is my opinion on the Woman's Congress? I never
consi4ered a "woman's congress" worthy of much thought,
but tben it doesn't take much thought to give one's ideas on
some subjects.
This particular "congress," it appears, is met to discuss
"Child Psychology." Almost every one with nothing; else to
do is nowadays whiling away the time treating this "com
ing question."
I have a very decided opinion that these women would
be much better employed mending baby's torn stockings
tnan in inflicting on a suffering community their "views on
the esthetic element in early education." If I were sud
denly called upon to care for a child and raise him to matur
ity I would crave the advice of the loving, experienced and
sensible mother. 1 would, moreover, upon bended knee
offer up a fervent prayer that I be preserved from that prod
uct of the "lemale congress," the spectacled divinity in
Easter bonnet, notebook in hand, who would, perchance,
dethrone common-iense and expect whims, freaks and hob
bies to elevate true motherhood.
What will this congress result in? What every one of
them always has and always will result in â more clubs,
more talk, more gailant, young, handsome, intellectual and
statesmanlike Mayors; more fashionable hats, more specta
cles, more notebooks and more crying youngsters at hume.

Will Be Ultimately Successful.
An exchange of thoughts ana con
cert in action are in general produc
tive of success. I think there can
be no doubt that the Woman's Con
gress will ultimately be successful in
its purposes.
This organization, treating to a
great extent with woman in her differ
ent stations in life, is agitating sub
jects which within a comparatively
short time have made themselves fore
most among the questions ot the day.
Many of these questions will probably
be left to be decided by the rising gen
eration.
The papers read at the conventions
are in general of a very high order,
aiid 1 think if they were read by a
larger number of peopie than can at
tend these congresses, they would
help to educate our peoDie as much as
our colleges and universities do.
While there may be some faults and
even evils in this institution, and
while there may be papers read in its
conventions with which we disagree,
still I think we may anticipate a great
deal of good in the accomplishments
of the congress.

Savj J^iucK of Value.
The Woman's Congress is with us again. During its
gossion many of the members who have spoken In former
cangres^e? have here been speaking asjain, thus proving
in one particular, at least, a certain lasting value in what
they have to say. Thes"e lectures are on subjects interesting
to the average person and in a large measure are on general
topics of the day. Hence, it i 3 not by any great display of
learning or tcnolarship or any special line of argument that
they retain the attention and respect of the multitudes. I
heard a girl call these women old maids, the other day, but
in my opinion they are neither old maids nor bluestock
ings. Neither are they women who do nothing but preach
and never practice. They are not "sew" women, who
think 'hat they must imitate men for that purpos- alone,
but they are refined, educated women, good wires and
mo.hers, and are trying conscientiously to help the coming
generation. CleoNe Cumsiings,

The Qervtle, Reasonable Woman.
The programme of the Woman's Congress now in prog
ress at Golden Gate Hall is of a very superior order and sup
ported by eminent talent.
Among the gentlemen whose names appear we find men
of very marKed ability, including some of our most cele
brated educators.
Comparing this nrray of intelligence and refinement,
advocating the cause of woman's advancement, with the
array of ignorance and prejudice desiring to Keep her in
her so-called "sphere," we cannot but regard the contrast
as a striking evidence of the propriety and justice of her
promotion.
Since such men are not overwhelmed with the awful
fear that their sisters, wives and daughters -h.ill be dis
possessed of their womanliness if given the same opportu
nity as man to progress, and since such men actually court
such a calamity, certainly we may gather sufficient courage
to brave the criticisms of petty and narrow minds.
Why in this age of progress should women alone be de
nied the privilege of moving forward? Certainly no educa
tional progress has ever yet caused any dire calamity, nor
will it.
The superiority of the American woman, with all her
liberties, over me Turk sh woman, who is possibly suffi
ciently su- jugated to meet the anproval of our adversaries,
is an emphatic illustration of what education and liberty
have done for our sex.

Gar\ Do |io Harm.
To give briefly my opinion of the
Woman's Congress I think it i 9 one of
the best movements which have taken
place in San Francisco fora long time.
My reasons for thinking so are these:
First, being as it is an attempt on the
part of earnest, honest women to meat
together and talk over those problems
and difficulties which the world and
every one in it are Interested in solv
ing jnst now, it is Impossible for it to
do any harm and it is possible for It
to do a great deal of good. Secondly,
every forward movement which tends
as it does toward the uplifting of edu
cation and the advancement and wel
fare of children is always to be wel
comed. Our children are our hope.
Whatever advancement we make po
litically or morally d>pen>ls upon
them, and if the Woman's Congress
offers any solution to this problem it
will be conferring the beat of gifts
upon v?.
It is for theÂ«e reasons that I cannot
see why people ridicule the idea of
such a meeting. Surely woman has
shown to the world by this tme that
she is fully capable of taking an active
and vigorous part in ir.

Jhe Ballot Would Gause Complications.
The general progress and standing of our community
are nowhere shown so clearly as in the individual spirit
of its men and women. In exact proportion to their per
ception of existing faults will ba the general movement
toward reform. With this view, a Woman's Coneress seems
an institution to be moat heartily commended.
But these perseverine women, although they locate evils
sharply and correctly, become unreasonable in their zeal of
reforming, and herein rests opposition to the congress.
They feel that a woman's hand on the ballot will redress all
the wrongs andgrievances in ourgreat Republic. Now, many
sober-minded statesmen think that the result will be com
plications, not benefit. Gladstone says thai great numbers
of thinking women are in opposition. Women have a right
to vote if they wish it, but since no real and lasting benefit
to legislation is to result the longed-for privilege loses its
attraction. Blanche M. Clarke.
Jhe Unselfishness of It.
A Woman's Congress is generally composed of educated! and noble women â
women of the world, who try to help and improve the position of women educa-
When these women hold a congress and invite all to come to hear, they tell
Bork, what haÂ» been done anU what Siiould be done, ana in giving to the audience such,
iof life they influence all who come to hear. Surely, if there are good women in the audi n:o
cc can be only tor the best.
These women have had many advantages on account of their superior intellectual trainine, and
it is their unselfishness which prompts them to devote their time and try to heip tuose leas fortunate
than themselves.
May these congresses continue and these noble women interchange their thoughts and ideas in
order to make the world happier and be:ter. LOTTIE HOLLING.

Being brought up to regard education as next to religion naturally such an organization which brings
within its scope bo'.b mental and moral training must demand not only ray respect but my admiration.
Its plane of action runs parallel with that occupied by the University Extension Courses. Such efforts
are ennobling as well as educational. Tiie subject treated in the congress of this year, "Education in
All its Phases," I consider an index <>f what the Congress hopes to accomplish. It strikes me that peo
ple who wish to know "What the congress is, anyway," would do well to attend some of its sessions be
fore they attempt to present their views, for, though ignorance may be their bliss, in this latter-day
Eden it is folly not to be wise. EMMA M. NESFIELD, Lo\?ell High School, Senior Class.
The question naturally arises, "What benefit has the community derived from these meetings and
through what source?" I have met some cynical peode who smile when yon mention the Woman's
Congress. They have not altered my opinion, Lecause they are the ignorant, dogmatic, egotistical
people. Ttiev assert that the Woman's Congress means woman's suffrage.
I have a high opinion of the Woman's Congress, because the women, by the discussion of living
themt b, have given a great impetus to thought and action in both sexes in all the spheres of life. They
have proven what intelligent women can accomplish. They have sown on fertile but hitherto negl-cted
grcund knowledge of law, of life, of home and of country. The Dress has generously aided the women,
and thus the knowledge finally permeates the masses.
The lords of creation who compose ;he various political and other organizations have been defeated
by Atlanta in the guise of ttie Woman's Congress.
The public have shown by their reception of the congress that it is a meritorious work.
MAIUORIE CORKERY, Polytechnic Higfa School.
The safety of the nation lies in the education of the people. The more widespread general intelli
gence becomes the better is the condition of the people and the Government. If we would have free,
broad-minded men, we must have intelligent thinking women. The conditions surroundlne a child
during his first ten or twelve years will exert an influence upon his whole life, and the mothers make
these conditions. The Woman's Congress has done much toward educating the women of Cali
fornia. It has given us glimpses of women in different walks of life: as mothers,
saleswomen, physicians, teachers, writers, artists and inventors. It has brought
betore ihe people subjects of importance but little understood before, and has
treated them in a manner that has interested women in their homes and taught
them to think of something besiiea making beds and pies and having dinner at 6.
It has taught mothers that children are not merely little animals who need
nothing but proper lood and clothing, but they must be studied mentally as well
as physically fed if good characters are to be formed.
The Woman's Congress has done inestimable good and will, I hope, continue
to do so for many years to come. MARION McAULAY, Polytechnic High.

The "Woman's Congresss," like all
other organized movements for educa
tional advancement, will accomplish
muchcood. When pure, brigh; minds
combine to devise methods for the
uplifting of what is best and most
admirable in human nature, there will
be no backward siep. Agitation of any
question throws a clearer light upon
it, enabling the earnest student to bat
ter understand the problem and more
readily segregate the good from evil.
"Education," the subject of the con
gress for this year, is one most appro
priate for the consideration o! women.
They constitute but half the race, yet
they are the mothers of the whole
race, and iho better and wiser the
mother, the wiser nnd better must be
come the man. One cannot conceive
of a race of brave and nobln men
springing from a generation of de
praved and ignorant women; nor of
a nation of cruel and selfish men
from gentle and educated Christian
mothers. So, as woman becomes the
equal of man !n independence and
strength, and man the equal of
woman in purity and all charitable
ness we will approach nearer the
ideal of what true manhood should
be. Beatrice B. Housk,

Astonishing Flight of a Carrier Pigeon.
The most wonderful feat ever required of a homing or carrier pigeon is claimed
for a California bird. The opinion is entertained that nothing like it was ever before
projected-; not since the flight of that historical dove which Hew from Noah's ark to
bring bn.'k the tidings of nry land to the lofty top of Ararat, at least. Half in jest
wus the feat discussed at a meeting of the California Homing Club.
'.'My proposition, '* a*id a gentleman of quiet but determined bearing, "is to fly
homing birds over the peaks of the Sierra Ne vada in midwinter."
"Can't be done," responded one.
Not since the fabkd discussion ever Thileas Fogg's proposed tour around the
word in eighty dnys had more incredulity been expressed.
â ''They will freeze to death," was another objection.
â¢ "Yes, or Jo;e their way," was another.
"Gentlemen, lam going lo try the experiment," said the quiet, determined man,
who is A. Carlisle of this City.
Considering many things, the chances were that the scoffers were right and that
Mr. Carlisle was wronr. There is no record of any homing bird ever flying over the
Alps, which are lower and not more forbidding in winter than many peaks of the
Sierra Nevada. The flight of Noah's dove was not over the terrible Himalayas, but
irom the mountains to the valleys.
The proposition made as a supreme test of the California flyers was to take them
ov-r east of the Sierras to Carson; to release them at Carson and let them try to find
their way home to the bay of San Francisco, crossing the sky-piercing and almost in
si'.perabie barrier of the Sierra, and possible snowstorms, bowling gales of the moan"
. tain region, lured to rest and refuge only by that love of boite which would seem to
be stronger in the breasts of gentle doves than in any other sentient being.
There was something so alluring in the proposition, so much that was new and
unusual, tnat after it was fairly understood others wished to try the experiment. It
was clearly seen that the winner of a rajce under such conditions would be an even
candidate '. ior fame with the storied "Jackdaw of Rheims" and the bird born of the
luxuriant and fervid imagination of the author of the "Arabian Nights" â the marvel-
ous roc.
Bets were made, lofts were overhauled and the best birds were selected to fly
above the clouds. Six birds went out, four from Mr. Carlisle's loft and two from a
loft in San An<ireas. Of the six only one is known to have survived. That one
reached his li.orue in Berkeley only durinsr the past week.
The idea was to send ihe birds out to Carson at the time of the Corbett-Fitzsim
.mons p riser fight. The four birdb from Berkeley went at one time, in ventilated boxesÂ«
in charge of a skilled attendant to release them at the proper hour, to bring back
news of the somewhat exciting happenir.es of the ringside. The gentleman having
the birds in bis custody was Charles R. Breck, who arrived by the Central overland,
which in crossing the Sierra pursues as sinuous a course as the path of the labied
labyrinth.
When he reached Carson the birds were fairly in terra incognita. The four Car
lisle Lirds had never been farther east than Sacramento before they were carried,
hood wiiiked, to Carson. They were born in Berkeley about two years ago. Their longest
Sight had been over comparatively level country, and they had never b<en compelled
to surmount anything mere lofty than the comparatively insignificant fringe of hilli
constituting the eastern range of the low-lying coast ranee mountains. They were
jaiseri in a land of practically endless summer, and the hills over which they had
(â een flown, carpeted richly with ginns and wiid flowers during much of the year,
were no obstacle, and really seemed as landmarks to guide the feathered messengers.
But when they reached Carson it must have seemed to them like another world.
The air was frosty, and over the slumbering and far Sierra the snow lay deep â a
spotless counterpane, disguising the mountain topography and waving and shifting
in the wind like a wraith.
They had not seen one foot of the road over which they had traveled. From the
ocean level they had climbed and climbed, in the cars, skyward to en altitude of a
mile and a half, and had then descended to the arena wheie winters storms are some
times tbe gla-diators.
Would the cunning little brains of these tiny handfuls of feathers conquer such
difficulties in their aerial pathfinding?
On the lvtn of March Mr. Breck released the four birds in his charge. They
weighed only cine pound apiece. So slight did they seem in comparison with the pro
digious.taÂ«k in view that they had the full admiration of Mr. Brect, who is cbservnnt
and keenly sympathetic. Wherever he looked abroad winter and the Sierra were lost
in clouds and covered with snow. Mr. Breck was not alone in watching and admiring
the birds. Betting on them ran lively, but the general opinion was that they would
never get through alive to the bay of San Francisco.
Like all homing birds, after they had been released from Mr. Breed's bands, flut
tering and undoubtedly surprised at their strante surroundings, the quartet at once
began to circle and taU the air in company, looking for some familiar object to guide
them. North and south and east and west they flew, scaling greater ami greater
heights of air, and necessarily reaching lower and lower temperatures as they flew.
Something as mysterious within them a* the architect-like instincts of the bee finally
told them that to reach home they must fly over the loitie. barrier far to the west.
HERE IS A TELEPHONIC RECORDER.
Probably no greater need ever existed
than that of easy and rapid communica
tion between distant points. It is only a
little while ago when to write a letter to
London and get a reply consumed three
\veek3 of time. Then by the laying of the
cable distance and time were both practi
cally annihilated, and the question may
now be propounded to London and its
answer received in tiie space of a few
minutes. Yet while the telegraph has
solved the problem of rapidity it is never
theless hampered by the burden of re
striction to brevity and is costly. So,
winle the presence of the wonderful mes
senger of electricity tliat has been har
jiessed to do service for man is rightfully
regarded as a marvelous blessing, yet
manâ the business one, especiallyâ chafed
under the restriction which the use of the
telegraph placed upon him. He desired
;o exercise more fully the power of speech.
Then came the telephone, and then man
could actually talk with his correspond
ent, unrestrained by tie inexorable "ten
words" of tbe telegraph. No invention
that has blessed the world in all time has
done more, to .humanize mankind than
has that of the telephone.
In the telephone speech is heard in the
receiving portion of th,e apparatus because
the diaphragm of the phone vibrates un
der the jrupulse of the electro-magnetic
current- It was thought, when the teie
l h me first came into use, tbat this vibra
tion miglit be employed to produce a
series of inipressionsor indentations upon
a disK or cylinder of wax, which could be
used as a phonographic converter. But
jppeated experiments have established the
Jacl that the vibrations, of the telephone
diaphragm, while actual mechanical vi
brations, are of so small amplitude and
force as to fender impossible the produc
tion of an impres-ion or indentation.
Inventive genius is not, however, ham
pered by any knowledge of the impossi
ble. From the day when Professor Bell
and Professor Gray exhibited their won
derful telephones at the Centennial Exhi
bition at Philadelphia in 187G down to tbe
present time thousands of brains have
been busily at work conjuring up a means
to accomplish what was wanted, and it is
now believed that the problem has been
solved by the production ol a device
whereby a telephonic message is recorded
at the district station without regard to
the presence of the distant correspondent.
A Mr. Clarke of this city claims to have
devised tbe long-sought apparatus. His
machine, which is shown in the accom
panying sketch, is extremely simple, and
it does not require any changes in exist
ing methods.
It is a we!i-Known fact to competent
electricians that a closed circuit â that is,
a circuit without a break of continuity
and charged with a current â may have its
potential powerfully varied by the intro
duction of very slight resistances. Now
tlje power or "pall" of an electro-magnet
depends upon the potential of the current
that i* passing along the wire forming the
helix of the magnet. On these two condi
tions rests the device of Mr. Clarke. He
has discovered that a liquid â not water
charged with a certain metallic salt iv
solution in capable of having the resist
ance io the passage of an electric current
very markedly changed by the applica
tion of extremely slight degrees of com
pression.
Now, supposing that an electric circuit
bo constructel having in its series an
electro-magnet and a tube or tank of this
Itquid. Then a slight compression of the
l:quid would diminish the resistance and
: allow the cjrrent to flow through the cir
j cult with greater facility and strength,
land the consequent effect of the current
i upon tbe elec:ro-magnet would be to
strengthen it and to cause it to attract an
armature with greater force. When tbe
p re sure on the liauid was removed the
liquid would then offer its greatest resist
ance, thus hindering the flow of the cur
rent, and so weakening the "pull" of the
electro-magnet. Thus by varying the
pressure upon or compression of tbe
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 2, 1897.
Once falriy under way, it is the habit of homing pigeons to fly in a straight line.
So it probably was with these birds. From Carson to San Francisco, in an air line, is
a distance, approximately, of about 180 miles. This is no distance for a homer to fly
under ordinary conditions and a very lew hours would suffice to traverse it. The
seq ci shows conclusively that the conditions wera very far from the ordinary.
The first information received in this City concerning an 7of the nomine quartet
came from Copperopoiis, in Calaveraa County, which is in the foothills of the Sierras,
upon the western slope. At that place, on tiie morning of March 21, flying wearily,
nearly iamished, brave Mme. Ro-e alighted and suffered herself, out ot pure ex
haustion, to bo captured. So nearly spent was she that after she hud been fed she
slept nearly twenty-four hours without waking. She had been on her perilous way
between three and four days.
Let those who respect human courage, dnuntless will and persevering enerzy re
flect lor a minute upon what this rliÂ«ht of nearly four days signified. During two of
the three days while Mme. Rose was beating the thin, cold air With her eager wings
blinding snows were fulling. Mountain streams were hushed under depths of ice.
The temperature, according to meteorologists, sank at times to 22 degrees below the
freezing Doint. With the snow came high and battling winds. In all the Sierras,
snow-covered and desolate, was no food for this wonderful little messenger and path
finder.
The lowest pass in the route selected by Mme. Rose was a mile and a half above
sea level. To reach this elevation the bird had to scale a height above Carson of over
half a mile, .Professor George Davidson of this City, who is familiar with the Sierras,
says that the pass must be at least 3700 feet above the altitude of Carson and 7000 feet
above the level of the ocean. Half blinded in that awful solitude, imrled hither and
yon from its true course by the winds which eddied in and out of the fastnesÂ«es of
the Sierras, night overtook the bird three times. There was no rest for it excepting
upon the trees laden with their winter load of ice and snow. Be it to the credit of
the pluck of the bird, as it must be to its sure purpose, that it did not turn back after
the first arctic night to seek the comparative comfort of Carson.
The next morning she was off a^ain, and the next and the next, all the time
drawing nearer, but by a devious course, to its own home a"nd dove-hearled mates in
their cozy cote on the warm and green Berkeley hillside. When it finally, still trav
eling toward the blue Pacific, reached Copperopolis. it had flown only what amount
to 110 miles in an airline. The time consumed shows conclusively that it had been
compelled to My many times that distance, or that the winds were fiercer and ihe
storms even more terrible than herein appears. The significant thing is that it had
departed little out of its direct course between Caraon and San Francisco, when, hav
ing actually crossed the Sierra, its overtired wings cams to rest.
It will be naturally asked how it was that Mme. Rose, having been at Copperopo
lis in Calavera< County on March 21, has only been back home a few days. This was
on account of her being detained by parties who had to be persuaded by prolonged
argument to restore her to her original owner. The other three birds of the quartet
are dead or lost. So are the other two mentioned.
Hatched March 17, 1894. The wonderful fly from Carson Oily was becun on her birth
day. Was awarded tirst prize at y.ige<ri show held at San Francisco In January, 1895.
March 9, 1895, flew in h race from Sacramento, being liberated in the presence of a large
number of legislators, and convoyed a message bearing tlie signature of the Governor and
three other State officials and those of all the newspaper representatives then at Sacra
mento. In this race Controller lolgaa acted as timer, Secretary Coglan as flyer and tno
Record-Union representative as scorer. April 9, 18i>">, took t>art in a public fly from Oro
ville. In a trial fly lroru Santa Cruz, June 11. 18i)5, E.I Martin, County Clerk, utilized
Ma'lKm Rose while sending an onier Rttnched to her sartor. Two days later s>hc flew with
eight other birds. a;l being reiecsed by Mir-s Anita Conzales, Queen of the Water Carnival.
The bird, on this occasion carrying a photoprgph of Qu^-en Anita, was shot, but came in
two hours after nil the other birds had arrived. The Cam, gave full accounts of this tiy.

liquid the electro-magnet would corre
spondingly change its attractive force and
its armature be attracted or released ac
cordingly.
In Mr. Clnrke's machine he employs a
glass box, the ton of which is formed of a
japanned iron plate, used as the dia
phragm of the telephone. The glass
box is completely filled with the liquid,
and consequently the v.brationsof the tel
ephonic diaphragm produce a series of
varying compressions of the Jiquid, small
in amplitude, but sufficient to change the
resistance of the fluid. This box of liquid
is made a part of a local circuit, which
embraces a battery of four cells and an
electro-magnet. The magnet lias an ar
mature provided with a stylus, and as the
attraction of the magnet varies, the con
sequent motion of the armature is by the
stylus indented upon the waxon cylinder
of a phonograph.
When not receiving a message, the
phonographic cylinder is out of ail contact
with the armature stylus; but at the be
ginning of a communicat.on the cylinder
is instantly thrown into contact by the
operation of an exceedingly simple
electro-mechanical devica and so retained
during the transmission of the message,
at Ihe termination of which il is rel ased.
At any time subsequent to the transmis
sion the receiving ope-ator has but to press
a knob, when tne speaking stylus is
thrown into contact with the cylinder,
which then bepins to rerolve, and the
message that whs transmitted a moment
or a hundred years previously is made
audible to the listener iv t:ie exact words
and tone- of the transmitting speaker.
The invention not only promises to sup
ply the wants of a large class of business
men; il bids fair to revolutionize tbe ex
istiug modes of news dissemination. The
morning ami evening newspaper is at
present a necessity, long outgrown Hie
nature of a luxury. The family have by
habit learned to require the newspaper.
With the use of Mr. Clarke's invention it
is possible to place a telephonic recorder

in every house, and all the instruments
connected with a "central" office, where
will be collected and edited the news of
the world, precisely in the same manner
as is now done in the central offices of the
Associated Press and the United Press;
but instead of telegraphing a condensed
account of the news to the newspapers to
be published by them several hours after
its occurrence, an operator at the "cen
tral" will speak the news into a transmit
ter and instantly it will be recoided at the
houses of the subscribers, unabridged, full
and complete. Then at breakfast, at din
ner or at tea, when the family are gath
ered around the table, a press of the knob
and 10, from a hole in ihe wall a voice reads
out the startling news of what is going on
in distant places. Should it be desired,
the machine may be made to repeat again
and again its message*. It while deliver
ing a message another one should arrive,
the electro-mechanism instantly switches
the cylinder into the position for its re
ceiving, and the delivery is interrupted
until the transmission of the new message
is completed. The action is purely auto
matic, and effectually provides against
any omission of communication. Proper
provision is also made for renewing the
surface of the cylinder when it is filled or
for replacing it with another. The ordU
nary familiar teleDhonic transmitter and
receiver may if desired be placed side by
side and the same circuit with tbe Clarke
machine, so that complete communication
to and fro may be had.

A Hitherto Unpublished Military Order From
General Grant.
For twenty-five years Captain Richard P. Thomas has resided on tbirty-two acres of the easterly race of the Berkeley hills,
and during most of that time fee has contemplated ultimately investing the area in some institution which would forever main
tain it to a form of public use. The captain's recent offer of donating the place to the town of Ferfceley as a park iÂ« his ultlmaie
decision alter contemplating two other forms of disposition, one to tiie Soldiers' Home, which tinaliy located at Yountvilly, the
other to the Slate University. The manageis of the home regarded the tract as not sufficiently large for their purposes and the
captain decided that, as between the university and the town, he would fay r the latter.
A unique feature of the captain's place is a log house which the owner built with his own nands, requiring seven years
for its completion. It is two stories in height, has two rooms below and a large apartment above. It is a comfortable lodge, and
the captain uses it as such, having fitted it up for a museum and smoking cabin ; here he lounges during evenings amid hi*
relics of the long past, an apgregation which covers the whole of the captain's li!e â a period of eighty years.
Many of these curios are mementoes of the captain's three years,' career in the army when he was lieutenant and ad jutant
of the First New York Cavalry. The collection includes his pistols and carbine, his saber, his great surtout, army uniforms and
Bats, together with an extensive gallery of rare war pictures taken within tbe Union lines by Brady, the Government photog
rapher, and covering hundreds of scenes and situations during the.entire period of hostilities.
One of the most interesting ol these exhibits is a letter from General Grant to General Sherman, written entirely in the hand
of the former and bearing the indorsement of the latter. The letter strikingly presents the effective means of extinguishing the
opposition writers that were employed in those days. It reads as follows:
Headquarters Army of Tennessee, Corinth, Ausr. 8, 18*32.
Major-General W. T. Sherman. Commanding United States Forces, Memphis, Term.â General: Herewith I send you an article
credited to the Memphis ci rrespondent of the Cnicaqo Times, which is bold false in fact and mischievous in character. You wiil
have the author arrested and sent to the Alton penitentiary under proper escort, for confinement until the close of the war, unless
sooner discharged by competent authority. lam very respectfully your obedient servant, U. 8. Grant, Major-Geoeral.
Upon the lower lefthand corner of the letter is in General Sherman's handwriting the following direction, evidently to tome
subordinate officer, to whom the letter bearing the indorsement was sent:
Do you know the man? Find him out nnd arrest.
August 14, 18H2. W. T. Sherman, Id a jor- General.
The letter was picked up in Memphis on the grounds which had been occupied by the Federal forces, after the withdrawal
of the troops, and ha-; never since gone out of the captain's possession. The captain does not know the identity of the correspon
dent, nor whether he was ever discovered or arrested.
On the highest point of the captain's land, and at an eminence not far from the summit of the mountain, lie has erected what,
he calls a fort, and which he declares to be the only private affair of the kind in the State. On an esplanado snrrounded by a c.r
cular parapet three 20- pound guns have been mounted in embrasures, and they command the eniire country. On the ristit lie San
Pablo Bay and the straits of Carquinez, San Qucntin and the Golden iiflte, while * discuarge from the piece on the lefi raizht rate
tha streets of Oakland. A liotise is built within the inclosure and used as a powder magazine, and every Fourth of July the pow
der in this arsenal is brought out and the guns boom all day long. The Fourth is a great day with the captain. Hesetsas:de
$500 for its celebration, hires a caterer to bring coffee and sandwiches on the mountain, and then invites the town. They coma in
hundreds, and for that day La Loma is a public pleasure ground. JOHN E. BENNETT.

CAPTAIN RICHARD P. THOMAS.THE SPRING EXHIBITION AT THE INSTITUTE OF ART
"MONTEREY PINES," by R. D. Yelland.
How shall the spring exhibition at the
Institute of Art be judged? Looked at in
different lights the conclusions reached
are of the widest extremes. "It is the
.-mallest and poorest exhibition we have
ever Had," is a statement many members
of the association have made, half apolo
getically. That it is the smallest is a fact
beyond dispu;e, but as to its being "the
poorest" there is. considerable room for
comparison.
On the whole the exhibition is excep
tionally creditable, much more so than
would appear at a casual glance. In the
first place it must be remembered that the
present collection of pictures is ttic third
that the artists of San Francisco have
exhibited within the past twelve monihs.
Surely this is a creditable showing in
itself. It must alto be borne in mind that
a number of tne exhibitors of former
years are not represented on the walls.
Ti.ei taking the standard of the work
shown the result is highly gratifying.
It must also be said to be encouraging.
Altogether there are 1 7(5 pictures huug.
'1 l.ese.inciude oil and water colors and
pastel as well as r en drawings, and black
and white. â¢â  .' . â 
Thomas Hill has always been "good"
fur several larye canvases, but this year
he is not represented. Nor is Amadee
..n, Joe Strong or Miss Withrow.
These fu-ur artists have always exhibited
strong pictures, and their work is cer
tainly missed. Tne reasons for their
not exhibiting need not be discussed here,
he old problem as to what consti
tutes a public exhibition is at the bottom
except in regard to Thomas Hill.
Strolling through the different galleries,
the generai effect of the exhibition is
pood. The pictures, with few exceptions,
are small, but the larger proportion of
i.'.em are pleasing and harmonious and
show good taste as well ss artistic skill in
t!ie selection of subjects. The feature o<
the exhibition 13 the large number of por
traits shown. There are more of tucs?
thuu ever before and the standard of work
is higher. In fact it isof the vary highest
-, both in regard to originality and
execution. Figure subjects ara more plen
tiful than usu.v. The landscape sod ma
rine wort is fully up to the usunl standard.
On the whole the .surpcts chosen are more
ambitious than usual.
The piece de fwftKpnce of the exhibition
â¢<â¢ Arthur Matbe^V "ForbidderiFruits."
Of this picture there is a great deal to be
s-aid. In tiie first place his a subject of
the most ambitious kind and worthy of
the brush of any of the great living mas-
U.-s. It deals with that ever-present
p. iblemâ the nude â and comes in the
ca'.egoryol "old subjects." All the->e facts
only increased the difficulty of handling it.
Many who have seen "Forbidden
Fruits" say that it is the most ambitious
I iciure ever painted in San Francisco. Be
iliis as it may, the artistcenainly deserves
great credit for what he has done, even
â¢!i tiiere be those who say he has left i
a great deal undone. j
THE
FEMALE
SPECIAL
WRITER
A3 the name indicates, "Forbidden
Fruits" represents the biblical story of
the downfall of mankind. The scene is in
the Garden of Ecten at the moment when
the angel with the flaming sword comes to
drive out Adam and Eve.
The Bible story relates that they hid
themselves "among the trees of the gar
den." It is this point which Mr. Mathews
has brought out in his picture. Beneath
a tangle of trees and underbrush. Adam
and Eva are crouching, as if trying to con
ceal their nakedness. Both are stricken
with grief, which is well indicated by the
poses of the figures. Behind them stands
the angel with the flaming sword pointing
the way out of Paradise.
The Bible story says the time was "the
cool of the day." In other portions of the
sacred hook tnis same term is used to in
dicate the early evening or twilight. Con
sequently "Forbidden Fiuits" is flooded
with the rich colors of dyinc day. The
little of the evening sky that shows is of a
warm tone and the same color scheme is
carried through the rest of the picture.
The conception of this wort can hardly
be criticized. As far as such a piciure can
be it is "correct." Anything which might
conflict has been left out of the picture.
In execution "Forbidden Fruits" is Mr.
Mathews' best work. The drawing of
the ligures is accurate and refined and the
atmospheric effect is beyond that usually
P-inted. The foreground of the picture is
low in tone and the sky furnishes the
plane of half-tone. The color-note or
high-light is a portion of the rising moon
showing behind the head of the angel and
the nilt of the sword.
A more difficult subject to handle would
be hard to find. To keep everything in its
place and at the same time hold the re
"EVENING, BRITTANY," by John A. Stanton.
I Went to a ten-cent restaurant.
That is, the placards about the door stated that meals were
served there for 10 cents, and placards ought to tell the tiuth.
I found out later on that these placards did.
I saw the signs. 1 was hungry and I had 15 cents in my
purse. Therefore, I decided to go in.
My heart misgave me as I turned the knob of the door. The
door swung open. I went in.
And then my pectoral muscle braced up and didn't missive
me any more.
It was a large room full of small tables, hurryinsr servitor?,
and the clattering and clashing complaints of thick crockery
thrown abont by unten'ier hands.
It was also full of atmosphere; not the atmosphere that
fills the canvases of our artists with glory and glow amid the
soatful throb of this, that and the other, but the ordinary,
"He had attacked a sturdy and courageous beefsteak."
' everyday atmosphere of Europ?, Asia and Africa, North and
South America, Australia and New Jersey.
This particular portion of atmospherp was very nearly solid
with the mingled odors of boiled vegeiables -golden carrot?,
plump O-Td fair-faced turnips, brown- jacketed potatoes, curdy
cauliflower, plebeian cabbage, beans green and dry, the lear
compellinp, breath-destroying onion, tish boiled and fried, the
cooKed flesh of beasts and the perspiring flesh of none too clean
humanity.
Several larpe blow flic?, with gauzy wings fnll of the sheen
and shimmer of rainbow huesâ violet, indigo blue, greeD, ye!
tow, orance and redâ and bodies of metallic luster and peacock
blue shade, buzzed socially in the window.
But let me whisper to you a secret ! Peacock blue is no
loacer fashionable. As a color to be desired it smells to heaven
from very dead ness.
But this- is not Paris, the beautiful and cay; nor yet Lon
don, the massive and the smoky. It is the Pacific Coast, the
Gold en State, the county ol isan Francisco, the city of ditto, etc.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 2, 1897.
f quired amount of brilliancy is as hard a
! task as an artist can set himself. But
| Mr. Mathews has done it and deserves to
| be congratulated on his work.
R. D. Yeliand shows several pictures in
his usual well-known style. All are accu
rate in drawing and good in color. They
are characteristic of the country they rep
iesentand as such are entitled to consid
: eration. "Beech and Maple Trees in
j Autumn, Arkville, New York," is the
title ot a small picture that will be a sur
i prise to Californians who have never seen
I the dories of an autumn in the East. To
i most of us the picture looks unreal and
â¢ exaggerated, but it is really true to
j nature. The brilliant yellows and golden
i browns are just as they realiy are at the
' time and place the picture depicts. In
' fact Mr. Yelland's picture is an exception
! oily good one of a difficult subject. "Mon
; terey Pines" is the title of another pic
j ture by Mr. YcllanJ that is exceptionally
1 good.
11 GATEWAY TO ALHAMBRA," by Matilda Lotz.
The female cashier paused in her inspection of a suspicions
looking two-bit piece and glanced at me sidewise as 1 entered.
I need Den, inic and paper >o write about her. 1 want a stub
pen, broad and generous of point, capable of dipping up laree
quantities of fluid and snreading it about freely. I want ink of

islands ot fuzzy and glutinous mold; and paper, snow-white,

She wore a front awful as that o! Jove himrelf, but different.
Hers was as shaggy as that of a buffalo, bristling with hairpins
falsely called "invisible," and of a dull and rusty black. Her
eyes also were black, and held within their shallow depths a
glitter and glint which told of a watchful and suspicious nature.
Her complexion, however, wns white, deadly, ghastly, flatly
whiteâ the whito of a whitewashed fenceâ the white of a plaster
castâ the wliite of a crockery saucer. It was red, though, upon
the cheekbones and lips, with a deep and rich and burning red
ness which mortal skin never wears of Its own free will and
accordâ with tlie heartless, soulless, changeless red which is
found in small boxes and vials.
Havine lcoktd at me with the cursory glance of one accus
tomed to seeing folks, sue proceeded to contemplate the dubious
two-bit piece again. She did not seem to be impressed by my
appearance, and my soul rebelled.
After all, the rurchare of Easter hats is a superfluity when
one's duties or necessities carry one among people of dull and
narrow minds, and cold and careless fives.
Beat a little less indignantly, you proud heart of mine!
There is something to be thought about here.

"From the Berkeley Hillsâ Springtime"
and "A Warm Morning" are the titles of
two pictures exhibited by William Keith.
Both are, of course, good, for the subj cts
they represent, but Mr. Keith has painted
better picturesâ very much better, in fact;
pictures better in color, execution and
composition.
John A. Stanton exhibits a small pic
ture entitled "Evening, Brittany," that
is a charming bit of work. It represents
a woman standing at eventide by the
shore of a tempest-tossed sea. There is
little to the picture but sentiment and
color. But how much there is of these !
The woman has her back to you, and 13
gazing out over the waters. The soft tones
of twilight pervade the picture. A limpid
pool in the foreground lends a color note
that subdues ail the rest to the proper
tone. Stanton also sends a line portrait
of General Houston. It is good in color
and a Hfe-liKe picture.
L. T. Latimcr sends a couple of pic-
tures in his usual style. They are charm
ing little bits. The one entitled "Solitude"
is a true bit of nature. It is a spot where
you long to lie and dream and let the old
world, a long way off, wag along as beat
it may.
Fred Yates, wtio at present has his resi
dence in London, shows several portraits
of a high order of merit. .Mr. Yat^s is a
former San Franciscan and was here re
cently on a vitit, at which time he painted
the pictures exhibited. The pictures are
those of Charles R. Bishop, General
W. EL L. Barnes and Irving Si. Scott.
Mr. Yates' styie in painting is full of
vigor. He handles color as if it were fun
;o him. Tliere is nothing laborel about
his work and all of his pictures are gocd
likenesses and need no label to those who
know the suojects.
Harry Stewart Fonda sends several
pictures of a uniform degree of excellence.
They arc all landscape and marine sub-,
jectf, painted low in key and subdued in
color. The best of tnese is a moonlight
picture entitled "Low Tide." It shows a
fishing-boat hauled high nnd dry in the
foreground and a number of others lv the
aistanc. The effect of the moon is ob

tamed in the simplest manner, but very
effectively.
Matilda Lolz exhibits two pictures of a
high order of excellence. Or.c, a picture
of a dog, entitled "Repose," is a good
piece of work. It is well drawn and strong
in color. "Gates of Alhambra" is the
title of a picture that would attract atten
tion no matter where exhibited. It shows
a roadway leading to the famous old
palace bathed in the warm, rich litrht of
Spain. It is the embodiment of art and
poetry, well and accurately painted, and
becomes more and more charming the
longer it is looked at.
"Village of Lasselle, France," and "Fish
Alley, Chinatown," are the titles of two
highly creditable pictures by Jules Pages.
Both are painted with a "anap" that Is
charming. Loose in execution and bril
liant in color.
Alice B. Chittenden exhibits several
flower pieces that are bits of fragrant color.
H. R. Bloomer shows several little land
scapes well composed and studied. Two
of them are foreign subjects and one is a
view of Tamalpais.
J. If. Gamble sends several landscapes.
"Wild Mustard" is the title of one that is
greatly out of the ordinary. It is well
painted and full of character.
Elizabeth Curtis O'Sullivan has several
portraits well drawn and painted.
Several small pastels are exhibited by
Lucia K. Mathews. All of them are cred
itable pieces ol work.
Helen Hyde sends several small figure
pieces that are worthy of consideration.
G. Cadenasso has several small land
scapes painted in the style he has lately
taKen up.
"Flowers to Huitzilopochtli" is the title

"You have terrapin?" I asked, "or grenouilles frittes?"
He looked at me. Again he did not understand.
It was not in him. It is not hi nnj waiter of his caliber.
It is the customer who must snffar. And he sniffed.
1 gazed at him and I wondered. Would he see me perish
there of hunger before his eyes?
I looked at the faces about me. They were eager, earnest,
intent, and the jaws of all were moving.
One man's ears and scaip were also moving, and the per
spiration stood in beads upon bis streaked and clouded brow.
He had attacked a sturdy and courageous veteran beefsteak
and was getting worsted in the encounter.
I pitied him, but be did not care. He was sufficient unto

Perhaps he only did not understand.
I looked into his eves. Th?y were the color of a sodden
cabbage, but they met mine bravely.
"Try again, Miss," he said.
I would have been more mushed on this waiter had he
sniffed less and talked more. Chronic coryza is not pleasinjr,
especially in a waiter. But he meant well, lie would have

In addition to the exhibition of paint
ings by local artists, thero is also a loan
exhibition of a collection of paintings by
J. W. Curtis of Australia. The*e pictures
were ordered painted Dy J. StaulorO, a
brother of t!ie late Senator Stanford, to
be presented to Stanford Univer.-ity. They
arrive 1 in this country a few weeks ago,
and Mr 3. Stanford concluded to send
them to the Art Association for a while be
fore hanging them in the gallery at the
university.
While not high-class works of art, these
pictures are, nevertheless, highly Interest
ing. All are of Australian subjects, and it
was the donor's idea that, they should be
topographically correct, as well as artistic.
He intended them to be useful in giying
an idea of the country where he lives.
Strange as it may seem few pictures
painted in Australia ever reach any other
part of the worid, and a3 a consequence
little is really known about the art of that
country. In the collection of pictures by
Mr. Curtis there are several things that
are confusing to a person not acquainted
with the subject.'. A noontide picture has
the shadows falling toward the south in
stead of the north, as the case would be in
this part of the world. The sunrises are
more gorgeous than the sunsets, and to
the eyes of Californians produce jnst the
opposite to the effect intended. Morning
looks like evening, and vice versa.
In many of Mr. Curtis' pictures he hns
introduced animals unfamiliar to us and
the effect is somewhat startling. In one
of his pictures there are a number of kan
He brought the viands and placed them before me. He also
brought coffee and a piece of cuke, some stewed prunes and my
check.
Then he left me to eat and meditate, and wonder, and gaze,
as I would.
When I rose to co the waiter sought me again, still sniffing.
"I hope you done well, M;sÂ«," he said.
I thought a moment. I had miased something in my meal,
but I would not chide him. He had done his best.
"You have no (inper-bowls, " I said, "and I had to use the
same fork for everything. There are restaurants which do dif
ferently."
His face gloomed. He frowned heavily and said:
"They charge higher, too."
I had not thought ol this, but he was right. I gave him a
nickel and walked out.
He followed me to the door and lapped his forehead and

smiled at Ibe cnshier ns I departed.
I had misjudged him. He was not such a clod as I had
thought. He perceived that I had a Brain. He suspected that
I was a Special Writer, and ha admired me. And he had a right
to admire me. "Why not?
I walked alo:ig the pavement and I met peopleâ lots of
them.
And I saw a waiter at the door of at^ o-bit creamerie. He
wore a clean shirt and a cambric tie. Also a coat, a pair of
trousers and a vest. Likewise a California diamond and a care
free smile.
It seemed to me that he wag happy. Happiness, perhaps,
is a mere matter of environment, temperament, and so forth,
aud so on.
And I thought of the waiter whom I had just left. And I
sighed.

Ancient Athens spread round the Acro
polis, especially on the hills facing the
south, which, are now uniuhabiteJ. The
new town lies to the north of the antique
citadel â an extension of the cluster of
houses already existing at the foot, of thÂ«
rock when the war was enaed. The main
intersecting streets were laid out â .iEolus
street, starting from below the Acropolis
and running northward, and Hermes
street, leading from the royal palace to
ward the Pirauis. The capital was thus
deigned to lie in the valley between the
Acropolis on one side and Mount Lyca
bettus on the other. No ambition
of future development is traceable
i:i the original plan, writes D.
Bicicelos in the January Century, The
ground chosen and the width of the main
streets :end to show that the founders of
the new city little dreamed of its rapid
extension. Squeezing herself out of her
narrow confines the city has gradually
scaled the loot of Lycabettus and spread,
beyond the valley on both sides,
principally in a southwesterly direction.
If the extension had been in a straight
line toward the sea Athens would now be
neariug a junction with thePirrous; bat
both towns, as if avoiding each other, ex
tend in parallel lines, and one must look
to a probably distant future for the day
when they shall be connected by rows of
houses instead of the long walls of ancient
days.
The fashionable quarters of the capital
are to be found in the new additions to
the primitive planâ the Neapolis, as it ia
called. Large thoroughfares have there
been opened, tine buildings erected, both
public and private, and Athens, already
tne finest city in the cast of Europe, bids
fair to become, if no stop be put to her
progress, one of the handsomest cities on
the Mediterranean.
Under King Otto's reign progress was
comparatively slow. At the accession of
King George, in the year 18G3, the popula
tion did not exceed 45,000. The advance
has been more rapd since then, especially
du;ine the last twenty years of material
prosperity, which has lately been inter
rupted, let us hope temporarily, by the
financial entanglements of the Greet Gov
ernment, Iv 1879 the census , snowed
a population of nearly 4(i,0C0; iv
1889, 114,000, and to-day, judging
by the vital and buildin? statis
tics, the number of inhabitants, if it does
not exceed, cannot fall short of 140,000.
The progress of the newly created town of
Piircua is not less remarkable. From
50C0 to 6000 souls, who had already gath
ered there some thirty years ago, its pop
ulation had grown to 31,000 in 1889, and is
now estimated at more than 40,000. To
gether the two towns number as many in
habitants as they probably possessed in
the fourth century ]J. C.
The sources ot information as to the
population of ancient Athens are indeed
vague; but from a passage of Xenophen
giving the number of families as 10,000,
and from a passage of Atheneus indicat
ing the proportion of slaves to freemen at
the time of Demetrins Phalereus, it may
be calculated that at that epoch the pop
ulation of Athens, including that of the
Firreus, was about ISO, OOO. The area in
cluded within the walls of both towns
seems rather to confirm this estimate.

EVENTS OF THE WEEK IN SOCIETY
It was expected that the few weeks between j
Easter Su today atid.tue Ist of June, the ac- j
cepted date for the summer: exodus, would be j
crowaed with dances, luncheons, dinners and i
teÂ»g, and Ihe \ v arious other festivities the i
smart set is supposed to Uke pleasure in. But
alas for the vanity of human wishes.
Fashionable eutortoinmsnts are few and far
between, and already the note of departure is
in the air. , .'
Few. have already actually departed to enjoy
the delights of out-oHow existence, but all
ore battling bravely with the summer ward
robe question, and everybody has decided
that momentous question â where to spend
the summer.
Theater parties, or rather opera parties,
flourished apace during the past week. Denis I
O'?ullivAn naturally was the magnet that j
drew trie elite to the Tivoli. On Monday
evening Miss Voorhies entertained a large '
I>ar:y of gay young people at the Tivoli, and ;
on Wednesday evening Charles Davis and !
Fred Greenwood, respectively, entertained j
large parties. All these parties were followed
by dainty suppers.
Ou Tuesday Mrs. Joseph Crockett enter
tained twelve ladies at luncheon at her home
on California street. Among Mrs. Crockett's
pues:s were Mrs. Thomas Masree, Mrs. Monroe j
Salisbury, Mrs. Timothy Hopkins, Mrs. Charles
Page, Mrs. Mouctford Wi.son and Miss Caro
Crojckett.
The most interesting social event of the com
ing week will doubtless be the dinner and
dance to be given by the officers at tne Pre- j
Bidio complimentary to Miss Ethel Cohen, j
fiancee of Lieutenant Bent. At the dinner I
covers will be laui for twenty-eignt. The only I
gentlemen who wi.l be present ure the Presidio !

interesting struggle for ti e valuable prop
erty involved may be reasonably ex
pected.

NEW YORK, N. V.. April 26.â W. L. J
Van Winkle of San Francisco came into
town a week ago and is making his head
quarters at the Gilsey. His business takes
him out of town every few days. F. W.
Smith of San Jose walked leisurely up
Broadway last Thursday afternoon. He
wil probably remain in the city for some
time after the great Grant parade.
At the Grand Hotel are a number of
Cahfornians. Mrs. Olga Eaton of San
Francisco has apartments there and will
remain a month. A. M. Goldberg regis
tered there on Friday morning.
Tho friend* of Miss Mary Scott, daueh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry T. Bcott, will
be happy to learn that she is quickly re
covering from the painful operation she
underwent several weeks ago. The family
is still at the Holland.
J. Mells, the popular buyer for Raphael
Weill & Co., has rooms at the Stuart
Hou?e. Mr. Mells is a very busy man
and the friends who attempt to find him
at his hotel have a disappointment usu
ally. Business takes him far downtown
among the large wholesale lace and silk
houses. By the way, laces and silks have
never been more lovely than they are this
season.
James H. and Rufus K. Love have been
busy during the past week organizing, or
rather reorganizing, a company to present
the original "'49 Mining Camp" that
made such a success during the Calilornia
Midwinter Fair three years ago. They
have been advertising for Western talent,
and are securing everybody they can who
took part in the original production.
They will open at the Madison-square
Garden in June, and at the close of their
New York season will go direct to Eng
land, where they have engaged to appear
wiih the "'4O Mining Camp" intact.
Dr. William Boericke of San Francisco
is at the Manhattan and will remain in
town until Wednesday or Thursday, when
he will return to Calilornia direct.
C. A. McLane is a guest at the Imperial.
A. M. and S. B. Bogart of San Francisco
are at the Sturtevant.
Frank V. Canning, tfho for srveral
years was connected with Boericke& Itun
yon's pharmacy in San Francisco, has re
cently bson put in chartre of the prescrip
tion department of Boericke, Runyon &
Ernesty's pharmacy on Fiftn avenue. Mr.
Canning has been in New York about
a year, and though he likes it
as a field for business advancement,
he regrets sincerely being obliged to leave
hit I. omo and friends in California. Mr.
Canning's sister, Miss Alice Canning, is
well known a* an oratorio and concert
singer. She is now one of the soloists at
St. Mary's, San Francisco.
Mr. and Mrs. Morris Willard of San
Francisco arrived the first of last week
and will sail for Europe within a few
days. They are at the Hotel Savoy.

BREACH OF PROMISE.
Sllsa Josephine Wall Demand* 810.000
Damages From Her Recreant Lover,
George W. Wise.
Another broken-hearted damsel has
sought monetary solace for her blighted
ana slighted affections. Josephine Wall
avers that on the of last December,
in the fair village of Pleasanton, George
W. Wise made a proposal of marriage to
her, which she accepted, and that be
promised to make her his true and lawful
wife within a reasonable time.
Mias Wall says further, that Mr. Wise
at all times behaved in a most tender and
afffCtionate manner toward her, and by
his constant attention and frequent pro
testations of love and expressed promises
of marriage she was induced to announce
her engagement, telling her mother and
sister and most intimate friends, and in
viting them to attend her wedding; and,
furthermore, she was induct d to make
preparations for the ceremonies and so
lemnities of said proposed marriage, all
of which v as at the instance, knowledge
and request of the said defendant.
Furtner detailing her sorrows, Miss
Wall alleges that on the 30ih of April,
1897, to wit last Friday, which is pro
verbially an unlucky day, the defendant,
"without excuce or cause, declared that he
had no intent. on, nor did he at present
have any intention to periorm his prom
ise of marriage to the said plaintiff; that
be then and there ruthlessly and unjusti
fiably relused to marry the said plaintiff,
although she requested him to do so."
The refusal cf Mr. Wise was followed
the day after by this suit for breach of
promise, showing that the woman of the
era is equal to any emergency, and is
prompt to act. She says that his "acts of
deception, lo wit, in decluring his love
and affection for her, and his repeated
promises to marry her, when at all times
he had no intention of keeping his word,
has caused her great grief, embarrassment
and mental anxiety, and thereby has done
serious injury to her feelings, affections
and pride, dnmagin? her thereby to the
amount of $10,000"

SIDNEY V. SMITH
SUED FOR DAMAGES
Mrs. Jannie Dexter Asks
$100,000 for Alleged
Libsl.
Smith's Response to a Former
Action Led to the Pres-
Eot Litigation.
Or. McNutt Interest d in the Dispute
Because He Consented to Act as a
Friend to Both Parties.
Mrs. Jennie B. Dexter and her husband,
Henry S. Defter, have sued Sidney V.
Smith for $100,000 damages for alleged
libel and defamation of Mrs. Daxter's
character.
The complaint sets forth that on the 7th
of last March Mr. Smith willfully and with
a malicious intent to injure Mrs. Dexter*
caused to be printed in the daily Chroni
cie ol this city a false and defamatory
libel, tending to impeach her honesty, in
tegrity, virtue ana reputation, and
thereby to expo:?e her to public hatred,
contempt and ridicule. The particular
matter complained of and ascribed to Mr.
Smith Is as lollows:
"I first met her in 1887," he continued,
"when she came tv my office on some legal
business. I transacted business for her frum
time to time for a considerable period, und
came to be well acquainted with her in a busi
ness way. There was nothing in the acquaint
ance that was not proper. One day she came
to me and said that tier husband wag about to
bring suit against her for divorce, and name
me as co-respondent.
"Although ."iicn a charge would have been
wholly groundless, the horror oi it and the
distasteful publicity and notoriety it would
bring, seemed so oppressive that I shrank
lrom encountering it.
'â¢Dexter, her husband, said it was true he
was going to bring such a suit. He said, how
ever, that while he insisted on a separation, if
she would go away for a year, so that he could
allege desertion as the cause for divorce, he
would be willing to abindon the more serious
charge, but lie said ho could not fifford to
send her away and support her and her chil
dren during the year necessary to constitute
desertion.
"She appealed to me, and, harassed by the
fear of tne threatened charges and without
taking advice, 1 yielded to bad judgment. I
told her I would pay over the moneyâ the
amount was $8500â but I was unwilling to
givi it to her uirecily and a-ked tier to name
some one to whom I should pay it for her. She
suggested Dr. McXutt, who was satisfactory .o
me. I gave Dr. McNutt a check on the Bunk
of British Columbia lor $8500, with instruc
tions to give her $3500 of It uere and to send
her tho balance after she arrived in the East,
where she was to go. Her departure irom here
was the thing that had been agreed on to
avoid the notoriety, ttie lear oi which op
pressed me, and it was to make sure thnt she
would go that I insisted ou this arrangement.
"Alter giving Dr. MeN'utt the checks for
$8500 I left town and remained away for two
or three days. When I came back Dr. McKutt
told me he had found her Â« difficult woman to
deal with. She would not leave until she was
paid the full amount, and thereiore he had
tomowhat exceeded his instructions, paying
over to her the entire amount ou her promise
to go East at once.
"A few days later I law her on the street
She had not gone away at nil. I realized then
thatlhad made a mistake, and I realized it
more keenly when I learned afterward that
her husband never really intended to sue for
a divorce. In short, I found that I had been
deliberately victimized. I acted then without
advice, and dreading the humiliation ol' such
a charge as was threatened to ba made, al
though it was untrue, I yielded to bad judg
ment. Now that ]am threatened again I shall
Ulf Murphy Building, /
Market ail Jones Streets.
not make another such mistake. I propose to
fight it and show the truth."
The plaintiffs aver that Mr. Smith well
knew that the foregoing false and defama
tory matter would expose Mrs. Dester to
public scorn and contempt, and that in
view of these premises she deems herself
entitle 1 to the $100,000 damages for which
she sues. J. N. E. Wilson is attorney for
the plaintiffs.
Some time ago the Dexters sued Mr.
Smith and Dr. McNuti for $5000, said to
be due for money deposited ior her use.
Smith's response to that suit led to the
present action for libel.
Independent Order of Foresters.
There was a public meeting held under the
auspices of Court Yerba linen a of the Inde
pendent Order of Foresters, at Shiels build
ing, O'Farrell street, Thursday evening, the
29th inst. A very interesting literury and
musical programme was rendered, followed
Dy an address upon the principal features nnd
objects of the order by Charles 8. Peery, high
vice chief ranger for California.
The speaker dwelt particularly upon the
plan of collecting assessments in the ordet
and the fact that there are no assessments
levied upon the death of a member. The poli
cies, he said, are paid out of the fund always
maintained for that purpose, the reserve fund
now amounting to over $2,000,000. The or
ganization furnishes insurance iv amounts
from $500 to $5000 at rates based upon the
best actuaries' tables upon strict business
principles in connection with Its fraternal and
social features. The address was well received
and was followed by dancing, which was in
dulged in until midnight. Court Yerba
Buena is very active and progressive.
The Service for Men.
To-day at 3 o'clock there will be a service for
young men only at the Christian Association
building. Mason nnd Ellis streets, which will
be addressed by Rev. J. George Ginson, pastor
of Emmanuel Baptist Church. There will be
a solo by Mr. Gibson and the congregational
singing will be under the direction of D. M.
Lawrence. H. J. McCoy, the general secretary,
will preside.

WHICH CURED HIM AFTER EVERY-

Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
man is slowly wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the most severe pain. There
is no let up to the mental suffering day or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and tinder
such a strain men arc scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the'writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison and thus end all
his throubles. But providential inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, nnd
be now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to fend his name and address may
! have the method of this wonderful treatment
free. Now, when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.

THE PROMISE OF MAY.
Mayday came to the people of California this year with fair skies and gentle
j breezes, bringing promise of rich crops and harvests of all kinds; revealing itself
! under every aspect worthy of the title of bountiful and beautiful May. It was
a day propitious to outdoor enjoyment and almost every field and orchard in the
State cave reasons to the people why they should be full of rejoicing that their
homes are in a land where May is as charming in reality as it has been made in
poetry and song. - . ...
Reports from many sections of the State published yesterday show that the out
look for all kinds of crops ,is aiatinctly favorable to sanguine expectations of
abundant harvests, while reports from the East concerning the conditions of the mar
kets .give prospect of better prices than have been known for a very Jong time.
Unless some abnormal change in the weather comes, this wiil surely be a boun
tiful year for California, and our Mayday festivities may be rightly accounted a
celebration of coming good. . . . .
The war in Kurone and the disaster to grain crops in many parts of the world,
and over a conÂ»iderable area of country in the United States, have caused an advance
in tne prices of all grains. The returns from California wheat-crowing districts
show that the condition of the crops here is most excellent, and the grain farmers
therefore have a good basis on which to rest their hopes for a year of fuller pros
uerity than they have known for a long period.
Dispatches from the East concerning the fruit crop show that there have been
grave disasters to the orchards throughout that section of the country from New
York to Georgia. On the other hand, our local returns are distinctly encouraging to
expectations of fair crops of ail kinds of fruit in California. Even those crops that
have been more or less injured are now reported to be in a much better condition
than was at one time thought possible. The fears of the dejtruction of the vines in
Fresno by the thrip seem to have been exaggerated, and the present outlook is that
the damage done will not exceed 5 per cent, leaving a fairly abundant crop to repay
the industry of the vineyardists.
The reports of the fruit outlook are to the effect that while some kinds of fruit
in some localities have suffered from the frost or from other climatic disturbances
the orchards as a whole in every part of the State are promising. Apricots have
been injured more or less in many localities, and in some places it is reported thdt
prunes and plums are dropping, but even in these cases the amount of fruit set on
the trees is so large it is believed the falling off will be no more than an effective
thinnins of the crop, which will prove a benefit rather than an injury in the long ran,
Reviewing the situation as a whole, California has ample reason to be satisfied
with the promise of May. The month has come to us in beauty and will bring
us bountiful gifts. All that is needed now to render the fair assurances of prosperity
doubly sure are showers, which will speed the wort of spring cultivation and furnish
to orchards and vineyards the needed nourishment If these come in due sea
son in the right quantity the summer will fulfill the promise ot the month and we
shall have a year whose prosperity will justify our Maytime festivities.
THE WOMAN'S CONGRESS.
The proceedings of the Woman's Con
gress Hirr.ish an evidence of the wide
range of problems in which the progress
ive women of our country now feel them
selves not merely intellectually interested
but morally concerned. Almost every
phase of social, political and individual
advancement has been reviewed by the
papers read and the discussions which fol
lowed during the convention, and these in
almost every case evinced not merely ear
nestness of disposition, but a genuine
thoughtfulness and serious study.
Such gatherings of earnest leaders can
hardly fail to be of great intellectual value
to the community. They serve to call the
attention ol people away from their own
personal fortunes for a time and lead
them to give consideration to those pro
founder questions and wider issues which
affect the larger destinies of mankind. It
is of advantage to every earnest-minded
man and woman to hear or to read what
other earnest and thoughtful people have
to say on such subjects, and even those
who do not agree with the conclusions of
the speakers at the congress 'vill have at
least derived from it the benefit of having
iheir own thoughts awakened into greater
activity and their own conclusions put
into more definite shape.
In all gatherings of this kind there are
of course people of whom it may be said,
as was said of the ten virgins in the Bible,
"Some are wise and some are foolish."
Not everything that was said merits un
questioning acceptance by the commun
ity, but most of it, ii not all of it, merits
this much of approvalâ that it was the ut
terance of a sincere mind and exhibited a
genuine regard for the welfare of indi
viduals and the upbuildrog of the moral
streuL'th of the Republic The discussions
turned in almost every case upon matters
in which women can play a large part in
determining results, and the whole effect
of the congress, therefore, has been cal
cu'ated to be beneficial and advantageous
both to the home r.nd to the community.
As our intellectual life unfolds and de
velops itself it is becoming every year
more evident that every large city or con
siderable town in America is to become
something like a great popular university,
in which lecturers will appear at stated
inteivals to discuss every subject in which
the public feels any concern, thereby
materially aiding the advancement of
popular studies on such subjects. These
lectures come in different forms, but they
all tend to the one end of increasing the
intellectual activity of the people. To
that extenÂ£ they are beneficial, even if the
causes to advance which many of them
are called are not directly benefited. We
may well be gratified, therefore, by the
bo.dine of a woman's congress in this
City every year and give the delegates a
warm welcome when they come and cor
dial thanks for their services before
they go.
PURE FOODS.
In connection with the arguments for
pure iood put forth by the Pure Food
Congress there is one worth noticing
which comes in the form of a sta
tistical table from England. It gives
the quantities of cheese imported into
the United Kingdom in 1596 and the
countries whence it came. There was
a total of about two and a quarter million
hundred-weight, and of this Canada fur
nished 55 per cent, while the United
States supplied 25 per cent. The big lead
that little Canada gives us is worth inves
tigation, for our showing of one-quarter of
the whole of the British imports would
seem Kocd did we not have to compare it
with the double as great output that our
small neighbor sends.
The report states that British consumers*
have become prejudiced against the
American products because unprincipled
manufacturers have shipped the adultera
tion known to commerce as "rilled
cheese."
If this be the cause of the difference to
our disadvantage, tlien the loss resulting
from the attempts to palm off the com
pounded article as genuine might easily
run into the millions of dollars to our
makers of pure cheese.
Something of the enormity of the adul
terated-food business is brought home to
us by the statement made in the Pure
Food Congress that the Government micro
scopist in the Agricultural Department
in Washington had in his library 115
sample* of counterfeit olive oil made in
the East which contained not a drop of
the pure article, and all of which was
labeled California olive oil.
This unchecked fraud makes it well
nigh impossible to produce the pure oil
profitably. The injury to honest Industry
is alone sufficient to aroue tue people to
its condemnation, but when we add to
that the injury to health, and the demor
alization it causes in the business and
manufacturing world, surely indignation
should reach such a pitch as will strongly
and sternly put down the evil.
The resolution adopted by the congress
that a society in this metropolis with
branches in all smaller towns should be
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 2, 1897.
organized to protect the people against
the counterfeited foods shipped into the
State and prevent the injury to our repu
tation by shipping such stuff out of it
ought to be rigorously carried out, as it no
aoubt will be, since public attention has
been directed to the evil and popular sen
timent roused to suppress it.
THE PICKLE GREEKS.
The sudden change of the Greek Minis
try recalls some curious historical facts
showing the fickleness of the Hellenes in
their choice of leader?. They are verita
ble weathercocks for shifting, and the re
cent change might well be considered as
having no significance beyond proving
the force of habit and the permanency ol
Greek political characteristics.
Recent history shows that they average
a change of Ministers about every ten
months. In the fifty-one years from the
foundation of their constitutional govern
ment to 1895 they had tried fifty-eight
Cabinets. They reached the excess of
fickleness in ISGS, when there were six ad
ministration?, and in the following year
their energy for change was so little
abated by the performance of 1805 that
four different Cabinets were called to ex
periment witti power.
Without passing any judgment upon
the wisdom of their latest change ii
might safely be predicted that no country
could accomplish any great things so long
as it lacked either statesmen capable of
outlining a wise permanent policy, or sta
bility and persistence among the people
to sustain tneir leaders for a period suffi
cient to give effect to a comprehensive
plan of action.
Whether the lack has been chiefly with
the leaders or with the people may be
' questionable, but it is crtain that they
| fail to get the combination of talent in
I the statesmen and confidence in the peo
ple. Historians say that in their heroic
I struggle against the Turks in the eariy
1 part of the century the masses of the
people deserve far more praise than the
. leaders, who had better material than
| they were qualified to work with. But
1 even if the people had a master-mind to
; direct them, it is doubtful if they wonld
; collectively obey him.
From the days ot old the Greeks have
been jÂ»alous of the power of truly great
men, and Jor any man to rise far above
i his fellows in capacity was considered
i ample reason for turning against him.
Probably if a man really capable of doing
! much for Greek nationality were alive in
that country now the fickleness of the
people as to politics would prevent him
from achieving anything of importance.
Even during their brave fight for freedom
1 in the twenties, when so much was at
: stake, they came very near losing all they
i bo lone: battled for because of dissensions
! among themselves. They stand indebted
for their liberty to foreign intervention,
though their own prowess might have
won it but for their lack in those qualities
which enable men to work together and
prevent courage and perseverance from
being baiHed.
What is called "ihe great Greek idea" â
I that is, the hope of some day having the
united Hellenic people refound the East
ern empire, wita the seat of power in the
holy city of Constantinople â Is a grand
ambition, and because of the boundless
debt we owe the race for our intellectual
possessions, perhaps tbe majority of civil
ized men would gladly &cc them there,
| but till the Greeks put away from them
I the fault o! fickleness it may be safely
said their dream will never be realized.
TEE WESTERN GEOWTH.
According to the local censuses taken in
the various cities throughout the United
States there are only two with a population
of over 40/iOO that have doubled the num
ber of their inhabitants since the National
census of 1890. Piemarkably enough both
of these favored communities a c on the
Pacific Coast; one to the north of San
Francisco and one to the south.
In 1890 the population of Los Angeles
was set down as 50,000 According to the
local censiiG of the present year it exceeds
100,000. The Herald avers that there is no
padded directory estimate about this cen
sus, it having been "carefully taken in
the reeular manner."
In 1890 the number of people in Port
land, Oregon, reached 40.000. In 1897 the
census figures approach 81,000. Situated
almost midway between these two cities
Hau Francisco contains 350,000 inhabitants
in 1897. an increase of 61,000 over the
population of 1890. which was given at
that time as 299 000.
As a rale the Eastern cities show noth
ing like such prams as those of Portland
and Los Anpeles, although some of them
have increased in about the same pro
portion as San Francisco. Plainly the
tide of population is moving westward as
rapidly, if not more rapidly, than it
ever did. The West being a newer devel
opment there naturally has been a grad
ual exodus from East to West ever since
the said new development began. This
gradual shifting of population is about
measurably represented by ban Fran-
Cisco's gradual increase. In other words,
San irrancisco's growth just about repre
sents the average acquisition of the West
from the East year by year. Twenty years
ago it represented much more than that,
for then people were flocking to San Fran
cisco for its individual attractiveness or in
answer to that magnetism which every
freshly growing city exerts and diffuses.
It is under these conditions that Portland
and- Los Angeles are attracting population
at an Abnormal rate. Their increase rep
resents more than the average Western
acquisition from tii#t East as did the in
crease of- Ban Francisco during its. ab
normal period of growth of twenty yearÃ
ago and longer.
OUourseitis the same Western spirit,
the same free enterprise and untamed
energy which make Portland and Los
Angeles so attractive to the quiet Eist- j
err.er that made Sau Francuco likewise
attractive in its early days of growth. The
Western spirit bas by no means given out
yet. San FranclÂ»co has gradually as
sumed the me'tropolitauisrn and steadi- j
ness of the large Eastern cities, those at- J
tributes coming naturally with growth ]
and age and maturity. Her increase will j
no longer be in bounds and leaps, but will
be steady and gradual, as a man broadens
and developes even after maturity. But
Los Angeies, Portland, and the newer and
smaller cities are still of the West, West
ern, and will still grow in the old Western
style. We are clad indeed 4o witness the
perpetuation of this spirit and the growth
of it even in these days, so many years
after the halcyon days of '4& Portland
and Los Angeles will develop into great,
steady metropolises, and v.-iil be followed
by other cities with thai breezy, enter
prising spirit to attract to the Paciiic
Coast the thousands and thousands of
that class of immigrants who have been
flocking here during tne past fifty years.

THE CLAN OF LINDSAY TO BE REORGANIZED.
Lindsay is not an uncommon name in
the United States, a country many of the
most eminent and successful of which are
the descendants of Scottish forbears. In
deed, there are Lindsays by the hundreds
and the thousands in most of the largÂ«Â»
cities of North America, and to them an
appeal has gone forth from the chiefs of
the illustrious Highland house of Lindsay
to signalize the present yearâ the sixtieth
of the re^n of Queen Victoria of Scot
landâby the reconstitution of the once
famous clan of Lindsay. The appeal is in
the shape of a circular bearing the signa
tures of the Earl of Crawford and Bal
carres, of tiis son, the Master of Lindsay,
commonly known as Lord Balcurres, of
the Earl of Lindsay, of Sir Coutts Lindsay
and of the pallant Lord Wantage, and has
been addressed to ail the known Scottish-
American associations, as well as to such
bearers of the name of Lindsay as
happen to have retained their associa
tions with Scotland. The circular in
vites all Lindsays to place themselves
in communication with the chief
tains whose signatures appear at the
foot of the document, at the same time
imparting any information which they
may possess concerning their lineage and
ancestor's ancestry, the idea being that
most of them are either descendants of
the medieval Lairds of Lindsay, or else of
the retainers ot the latter. For with the
Highland clans in the Middle Ages the
followers and dependants of a chief,
especially thosa born on his lands, were
wont to assume not only his tartan, bit
badge and his war cry, but also his very
name. Retainers no matter of what
aegree.no matter whether they sat above
or below the salt, were regarded as mem
bers of the family of the laird as his
children. Indeed the word "clan" ij the
Gaelic translation lor "children" of a
common parent. And on the understand
ing that most of the Lindsays in various
parts of t:ie world derive their origin, if
not from the noble family of Lindsay it
self, at any rate from some of its old-time
retainers, it is proposed to organize them
once more into a clan, banded together
no longer for warfare on the southron, but
for mutual help and assistance â in one
word into a sort of benefit society, each
member of which would have a right to
wear the Lindsay tartan and the Lindsay
badge, and to feel tbat if in America he
wns not without kinsfolk in the grand old
"land of cakes."
Perhaps ii may be of assistance to those
of the Lindsays in the United States who
have no records of their ancestry, and
who are consequently in doubt as to their
relationship to the Lp.irds of Lindsay to
know that the members of the noble
house of that ilk have from the days
of the Norman conquest been distin
guished lor their sandy hairâ some peo
ple call it carroty, just in the same way
that the Douglasses of Scotland, of Ger
many, cf Scandinavia and of Austria are
all noted for the swarthinessof their com
plexion and the raven hue of their capil
lary adornments, whence the name of
"Black Douglas." And it may encour
age the Lindsays on this side of the
Atlantic, moreover, to learn that there
are no unpleasant sayings or proverbs
connected with their ancestral name.
Thus when poor Sir William Gordon
dimming wns branded by means of the
Cranby Croft scandal, followed by the
baccarat trial, as a card cheat â there are
many who believe him to have baen in
nocently condemned â the old Gaelic say
ing was recalled according to which
"while there's a leaf in the wool, there'll
be treachery in the Cummings." In the
same way, every bearer of the name of
McKenzie labors under the tradition to
the effect that "no McKenzie is ever gra
cious until he is fed." To the predatory
instincts of the MacFarland's tribute is
borne by the proverb, "while there is a
forest in Kintale, MacFarland wiil
never be without cattle in his fold."
Every true- blooded MacLeod should have
deflected extremities in order to live up to
the nickname of which their clan was
once so proud, namely, "the MacLeods of
the bandy legs." In the same way the
Campbells are noted for their "crooKed
mouths" and for their "black mouth!","
and it is added "there never was a Camp
bell without guile." A few other classi
fications of clan character are the "dirty
Dalrymples," the "windy Murrays," the
"idiot McQueens," the "slow Mackin
toshes," while the MacCullums are re
nowned north of Castle Stirling as the "de
scendants of the sixty fools." The Mac-
Gregors feel themselves under a certain
amount of obligation to live up to the tra
dition that "there was ne'er a boor of the
MacGregors," while if the McNabs are
famed for the virtue of the women it is be
cause of the old proverb according to
which "there was a ne'er a hussy of the
Mac Nabs." The only classification that I
can find with regard to tho name of Lind
say is the occasional reference made in
Scottish records to the "light Lindsays."
But whether this has regard to the hue of
their hair or to the Mightiness of their
conduct I am unabie to say.
The Lindsays are one of the grandest
houses in the history of Scotland, and
there are few names that are to be found
so frequently and figuring so prominently
on every page of the glorious annals of
Queen Victoria's northern kingdom. It is
claimed that tiiey are of Scandinavian,
rather than of Gaelic, origin, and that
they are descended from the same stock
as the Dukes of Normandy, who, after the
battle of Hastings in 1060, became kings
of England. They were for a long time
the feudal lords of the now so glorified
Hnmiltons, and frequently intermarried
with the roynl bouse of Stuart, while
among tlie foreign sovereign bouses who
include Lairds of Lindsay and of Bruce
among their ancestor?, is the royal dy
nasty of Bourbon and thn imperial house
of Hapsburg. So great waÂ» the grandeur
of the Lords of Lindsay in thu fifteenth
century that when the chief, the fifth Earl
of Crawford, Lord High Admiral and
Lord High Justiciary of Scotland, was
created Duke of Montro.se by King James,
he relrained from assuming the title, con
sidering it to be beneath his dignity, an
example which was followed by his imme
diate successors, although his descendants
of the present day claim the dukedom in
question, which nearly 200 years later was
conferred on toe head of the hou^e of
GrahSrn.
Ol course there is no great Scotch house
the annals of which are not stained with
blood, and that of Lindsay is no exception
to the rale. For John, the sixth Earl of
Crawford, helped his sister-in-Jaw to mur
der her husband, bis only brother, while
the oldest son of the eighth Earl, who is
known id Scottish history as "the Wicked
Master" of Lindsay, assassinated his
father, and was, in consequence thereof,
and in accordance with the law of Scot-
land, debarred from the succession to toe
estates and dignities. These passed to a
distant cousin, the ninth Earl, a gentle
man in every sense of the word, for, with
the consent of the crown, he reconveyed
the earldom and the estates to the
Wicked Master's only son, whom he
brought up and educated, and who suc
ceeded him as tenth Earl, his own son re
ceiving from the crown, as a reward for
, this piece of generosity, the title of Lord
Edzell.
The present Earl of Crawford and Laird
of Lindsay, the principal chieftain of the
clan now about to be reorganized, is the
twenty-sixth Earl of Crawfoid and the
thirty-fourth Lord of Lindsay. He is
probably the most learned member of the
House of Lords, and under the title of
Lord Lindsay, whicfi he bore until the
death of his equally accomplished and
celebrated father, he achieved great fame
throughout the scientific world, especially
as the foremost British astronomer of the
century. Widely known as is His !:ume in
this respect, it received still more
notoriety in connection with the mys
terious robbery of his father's corpse, the
outrage being almost identical with that
perpetrated at the expense of the laic A.
T.Stewart of New York. Three months
after the old p.er's death, the mausoleum
which he had erected in the park of his
country seat, Dan Echt, in Aberdeen
shire, was found broken open and the
corpse removed. The services of every
imaginable detective agency, both official
and private, were brought into play in
order to discover a clew to the "resurrec
tionists," and the whereabouts of the
body, and an enormous amount of money,
was spent in this manner without the
slightest result being attained. Nearly a
year later, however, the body of the dead j
Earl was discovered by the head gardener
o; Dan Echt buried in the shrubbery not
more than a few hundred yards
distant from the mausoleum. Under the
circumstances it is not unnatural that the
present Earl should have endeavored to get
rid of a place associated with memories of so '
grewsome a character, and quite recently he
has disposed of the estate to a syndicate who
proposed to establish there a great school on
the lines of Eton and Harrow. The superb as
tronomical instruments, which were a feature
of Dun Echt and which earned for the ob
servatory a name throuehout Europe and
America, have been transferred to the new
Royal Scotch Observatory near Edinburgh
with which Lord Crawford has endowed his
native kingdom, whiie his splendid astronom
ical library, second only to that of the Impe
rial observatory at St. Petersburg, has likewise
been presented to the Scotch nation.
While the Earl of Crawford wears on his
breast orders conferrod by foreign govern
ments for his services to international science,
the Prussian order of merit and the broad rib
bon of the Legion of Honor figuring among
the number, his kinsman, Lord Wantage, has
on the lapel of his evening dress coat a tiny
bit of gun metal, of no intrinsic value, and
yet which in the eyes of an Englishman b
more highly prized than the Briton Order
of the Garter, or the diamond star
of any foreign sovereign, for its possession is
equivalent to a recognition by the State and
the Na'ion that its Dearer is a hero, since the
Victoria cross is only couJerred for some alto
gether exceptional act of gallantry in Jthe face
of the enemy. Lord Wantage won this as a
mere lad of 22 at the battle of Inkerman, in
the Crimean War, from which he returned
home a lieutenant-colonel at the age of 23. So
distinguished, indeed, were his services in the
war that the Prince Consort insisted on up
pointing him as equerry to the Prince of Wale*
ou the first formation of the household of the
heir apparent. Marrying the daughter ami
heiress of Lord Overstone, he became possessed
thereby of one of the largest fortunes in Eng
land, leit the army and established himself as
! a territorial magnate in Berkshire and promi
nently identified himself, not only with the
Ambulance Society, but also with the volun
teer movement, serving fur a rime as colonel
of the Honorable Artillery Company. Nine
! years ago the Queen transformed him from
Colouel Lord Lindsay Into Lord Wantage.
Sir Coutts Lindsay, another of the signers of
the circular above mentioned, has seen serv
ice not only as a colonel of the Grenadier
Guards of the English army, but also as a
(iaribaldian soldier. In later life he has aban
doned the sword for the brush and achieved
great distinction as a painter. He is the owner
of the Grosvenor Gallery In London, the popu
larity of which as well as its prestige Is but
little inferior to the Burlington House, in
which the Royal Academy has established its
headquarters. From this it will be seen that
the heads of the house of Lindsay ana those
who are now endeavoring to reconstitute the
ancient clan of "Light Lindsay" are men who
would be regarded as useful and notable
members of society in any part of the worldâ
i men of whose kmsmanship there *â  no need to
, be ashamed and to whom one can without iay
i ing one's self open to a charge of subserviency
j accord that respect and allegiance which are
I due by the cadets of an ancient and illustrious
house to its head.
It Is not the creation of a new clan that Is
being proposed, but the reorganization of one
of the most ancient and important in Scot
land, so that those who respond to the circu
lars ot Lords Crawford, Lindsay, Wantage,
Balcarres and of Sir Coutts Lindsay wi'l be
entirely safe from the ridicule which attaches
nowadays to what are known as the "dutt'er
clans." These are to the real old Highland
tribal associations what the mushroom nobil
ity of plebeian extraction Is to the old blue
biooded aristocracy. Nowadays as soon as
ever a man makes his pile In the "city" by
means of the manipulation of stock or by
company-mongertng. be immediately invests
a portion of his Rains in the purchase ol "a
place in Scotland," usually the castle nnd do
< main of some impoverished chieftain. And
j oblivious of the fact that in buying the estate
he has not purchased either I â¢â  ancestry of
the former owner nor yet the allegiance which
people of the district* accorded to tne "old
laird" as his due, he Immediately blossoms
forth as the chief of a clan, either adopts the
tartan of his predecessor or 'Use gets his tailor
to invent a new one for him, aud surrounds
himself with a number of retainers who are
willing to hall him as their chief ro long as he
provider them with lodging and board, es
pecially drink. Some of those "nouveaux
riches" lairds are gentlemen of obviously |
Hebrew extraction, others are Angiomaniac j
Frenchmen and Americans, while 'here are I
even some German bankers among them.
These are known as "duffer lairds," and their !
clans, which are composed In the main of
parasites and hirelings, ns merf "duffer
clans," and it is difficult to conceive the pro
found contempt wiih which they are one and
all regarded by the real article.
While it is natural that the creation of new
clans in this manner should constitute a
source of ridicule, yet it is impossible to do
otherwise than coÂ«nmend Ihe efforts which
are being made to retain Intact as far as pos
sible the tribal feelings and system among
the o!d historic clans. They constitute, not
| only a link with the past, but also a source of
; strength, since each member feels that he has
the whole of his clan behind him and that he
' is under a hereditary obligation to do noth
i ing whatsoever that can in any way brine dis
! grace upon its name, or upon its tiirtnn. That |
i It does not in any way impair the indepenri- j
: ence oi the citizen, or destroy his self-respect,
! is shown by the fact that Scotch Highlanders'
! have earned a name throughout the world for
j tuelr stuMy and rugged tranisness, and ior
1 their absolute freedom irom everything in the
! nature of servility. Indeed, it is doubtful
I whether Queen Victoria, who has nearly
i 400,000,000 human beings subject to her rule,
I has ever heard so many home truths, often of
I an unpleasant nature, as fell from th..- lips of
â¢ surly but honest old John Brown. I^oyal High
i landers are true as steel, but not subservient
j and even the iowest of tne m has a lar keener
i sense of his own personal dignity than many
j a southe r n peer of the realm.
In some respect* the Highlands may be said
I to constitute a corner of the wond that is
j entirely apnrt from tho remainder, since no
j wherein Europe have old principles, tradi
tions, customs and even fashions been more
strictly observed than north of Castle Stirling
The Highland funerals to-day, for instance
are precisoly wnat they were hundreds of
years ago, aud when the dying clansman has
gone "traveling" or has "gone away," me un
dertaker comes with his "stretching-board" to
give the bent frame once more the straight
ness of youth, the plate of salt is put on the
breast to propltatu the evil spirits, .he It/oklng
glass is turned face to the wall and ihe clock
is stopped. For ghosts do not like to see their
own reflections, and in tne house of death
time Is of no account auy more. Nor must the
"mort c;oth" or pall be forgotten, while a
basket containing bread and whisky must in
variably be placed in the cart whicii serves as
hearse, to refresh the mourners by the way.
Every clmsman of the batter class considers it
his duty when he lenves home to carry his
shroud with him, and there are some even
who go so far as to go nowhere away from Scot
land without carrying their stretching-board
along with their "camaus" or 'â¢shinty" clubs, '
For it would never do "to go traveling" with
out getting straightened out on the stretching
board, a fact to which I would respectfully
call the attention to the American members ot
the grand old clan ol Lindsay. Ex- Attache.

â¢It- is a dreary picture of liie in the southern
â¢portion' pf this Stale that Miss Beatrice Harra
â  d-en has presented in her latest book, "Hilda
!.BtrÂ«fferd," whose sub-title is "A California
S:<>ry. i!:,u:;.: probably her most ambitious
'effort, -Miss Htirraden's story occupies but a
r of hundred small pages. In theseshe has
â  â elaborated a theme in the selection of which
"she has not been happy. Her story is abso
lutely void of cheerful suggestion, and, seen
through the eyes of "her heroine, the life of a
rancher in California is a miserable one in
detd.
. . The render will naturally like to learn how
V Hilda Stratford" compares in point of liter
ary merit with its author's first successful
work, "Ships That Fuss in the Night." For
ai.swer it can be said that in thÂ» later book
.there is ample evidence to indicate that Miss
Hurradeu has acquired quite a degree of finish
since" tne- publication ol her first work. The
novel be 10 re us Is free from the faults of the
beginner in the art of writing fiction. Its
situations are iess strained and there is greater
unity to the.. whole. Its ending, too, is more
satisfactory, though, it must be confessed,
quite as gloomy as in "ihips That Pass in
the Night."
It is well known that Miss Harraden came
to California several" years ago in searcti of
health, the has resided lor the main part in
Kan Diego ana vicinity, and for mat reason
may be supposed to have seeu and noted life
aÂ» it is lived in that part of California, Being
an Englishwoman and an enthusiastic lover of
her native country, she has also noted the con
dition oi the so-called Euglisu colonies, whose
inhabitants are popularly supposed to have
luile else to do than to smoke particularly
â  tong pipes, play tennis and golf ana to be
â¢ svrvde the earrh ta-tefu.iy attired in straw
'â '.â¢â¢.:* and turned-up trousers. Here, one would
- would have been a eood opportunity
for character drawing of a jolly order. But
our aolthor has taken another and less cheer
.iui path. In "Hilda StraSord" she relates the
. ry of an English rancher. One Robert
; .-â .-affurd, whose experiences of farming had
acquired at the expense of much dis
.â¢.>ter, at the openin-g of the story is awaiting
the nrrival of his "girl" from the old country,
Mm he is to be mnrried. Rjbert is
tfol of the manner in which she will
Â» to the new life, and his doubts are amply
:.cdby the course of events.
The. girl arrives and they are married.
e.ly three weeks elapse before a heavy rain
' comes on, nn-4 the carefully built reservoir on
: the ranch, to the erection of which its owner
has :given all his thought and most of his
strength, bursts, and Robert Straff ord is a
rutoed man. Then the true character of the
girl he has married asserts itself. She evinces
â  nptihe slightest sympathy for her husband in
his trouble, mtsrely occupying herself with
thoughts of her English home and the com
forts of the more civilized portion of the globe
whence; she came. Then she quite breaks
down. Turning to Overleigh, her husband's
tioÃest friend and chum, she Bays:
' ->-But. why, why Ax> people come here? Whtt do
they find here to lilce? What do they get, in ex
cha ge for all- they've losi? Why, in the name of
;hf-aven, did Robert set' le In such a place? Why
did you choose to come here? Are you go.n? to
â¢etvy here Eh your lives? 1 ell nic whai it all
hieuns. Tell me Irankly and honestly whether
you care foe your life h*re, aud whether you wou.d
not throw-it up to-morrow, if you could."
I n-ill teli you what it all means," said BeD,
slowly: "it means that it's a land and a life fur
mm and not for. women. We men gain In every
particular; do :more small clerkships for us; no
nii-re -inYpriso-unieiit in air. ess cilices: but out-of
door fr-tduiri unJ our own lives to ourselves and
. our own Laud. 1 his i-s what it all means to us."
Here we hare two views of life on a Califor
nia ranch /by two persons of Englibh birth,
and it is plain that the man's view is the more
philosophically satisfactory of the tyro. Hilda
cannot see it in. the same light. She answers
â¢ â â tjl.nerly that, "there are no compensations,"
a-nd n told that there are none "unless you
know how to rbv-e desperately." This she cer
ts iuiy does rioi know, and in a fit of despond
ency state's the iact to her husband. He is
inexpressibly shocked at finding that all his toil
to save enough to bring the girl out to him,
his labors on the ranch and upon the house
have gone for naught, and that, as she ex
pressed it: 'If I were a man I would rather
starve at home in my old career thau cut my
self off from the throb and pulsation of a fuller
)jfe, and to-morrow I Will turn my face home
ward and thank God that I had freed myself
at last."
Kobert's face was ashen. Twice ac tried to
gjiealc and his voice failed him.
1 hen he said quietly:
â¢ .Never fear, Hilda, you shall have your free
dom."
He opened the door and passed noiselessly out
Of the hous.\
That night Robert Strafford was stricken
with, a fainting fit, and Hilda's prayer for
"freedom" Is answered by the death of her
husband. The book closes with the return of
the widow to England.
From the brief outline here furnished,
it will be seen that Miss Harraden, speakirjg
through Hilda Strafford, has not much of a
favourable nature to Kay about the advantages
that the portion ot the Slate with which her
novel deals hold? out to the prospective
rancher who hails from old and densely popu
lated centers, and who maybe accompanied
by s wife who lias neither familiarity nor
sympathy with the conditions of the more iso
lated life of a new la,nd. The great fault she
fijnas appears to be its loneliness and the
accompanying longing fur a return home or a
Beul.ement in a more densely populated por
tion of the country.
â¢ itseemsa pity taat Miss Harraden should
have been afflicted with a physical and men
irl unheilth which induced her to depict so
gloomy a situation as that in which Robert
arid Hilda Strafford found themselves. We
must assert : our belief that Southern
California is not, especially in winter,
quite so desolate a place as she would
have, us imagine.. The life on a ranch
may- not possess the attractiveness of resi
dence in the city, but it cannot be doubted
that â¢ it has; its compensations. In fine,
all Californians will find, in this book
of Beatrice Harraden's matter for re
gret!: that any *ection of our country
should have been exhibited from the strabU
nia'.lcview of an invalid, who was evidently
not sufficiently familiar with conditions
in general, either in Southern California or In
other parts of the State, to properly depict its
life', or to select from Us features such material
for- a novel as would rightly represent its
pleasures and .its advantages, even though they
might be mingled with the discomforts which
tire always- incident to settlement in a new
Emanuel Eliab.
ARTISTIC.
'.'Upland PASTURE!-â By Adeline Knapp. East
â  -Aurora. New York. The Koycrofi. Plintliig Shop.
;MiÃa. Adeline Knapphas many pretty things
â¢to say in this .little volume which is artistic
tq a rare, degree even in this day of pretty
books. The sab-iitle is "Some outdoor essays
dealing with the beautiful things thnt spring
and summer bring." The comments on the
flowers and woods and showers of spring are
very wise and eloquent. The style of the work
is an extended treatment of the thought ex
pressed by Bryant: "To him who, in the love
of nature, holds communion with her visible
forms, she speaks a various language." and the
author has chosen only to hear nature when
â¢â¢she ha* a voice of gladness and a smile, and
eloquence and beauty."
Mingled with the botanical lore of the
volume is much moralizing very gracefully
done, which lea<ts the mind to find a sacreu
ministry in the flowers, and the talk about the
flight of birds is made to suggest aspirations
to so use the buffeting winds of fortune as to
rise higher and swifter on them than could be
done in any calm.
High praise is due to Elbert Hubbard for the
lovely illumination of the little book. There
are but 600 copies of this elaborate edition
and each is signed and numbered.
GOLDSMITH'S SWEETHEART.
ITTK JESSAMY BHIDKâ By F. Frankfort Moore.
Chicago: Herbert stone it *.o. For sale in til s
Cits- by William Doxey, Palace Hotel. Price
Si 50.
The Jessamy Bride was the pet naroe for the
girl belovod by the famous author of the
â¢â¢Vicar of and the story gains con
siderably in interest by describing to us what
may have been the heart history of this
writer, who is so widely admired and liked
for the beauty of his literary works and the
self-revelation there. Many other famous per
sonages are introduced into the book with so
much skill that we recognize them as life-like
from our literary recollections of these old
acquaintances. We meet again with the pon
derous Dr. Samuel Johnson, who thunder's his
domineering logic at poor old "Goldy" and
others with self-satisfied rudeness. Sir Joshua
Reynolds, the famous painter, is here, and
David Garrick and Edmund Burke, and they
are made to talk entertainingly and naturally
to us from the pages of a pretty love story.
Part of the book is devoted to a description of
an evening spent by all these notable men
together at the Crown and Anchor tavern in
the Strand, and the conversation represented
to have taken place there is quite a work of art.
David Garrick gets off a bit of impromptu
acting before these friends which Joshua Rey
nolds pronounces better than anything he had
ever done on the stage, and in it he manages
to administer a deserved rebuke to his old
schoolmaster, Johnson, which will be keenly
appreciated by all who b)th admire that man
of immense words for his greatness and good
ness and hate him for his brow-beating rude
ness and sel -opinionativeness.
There U a tine description of the strain ot
anxiety that was put on Goldsmith when his
great comedy, "^he Stoops to Conquer," was
being prepared for the stage and the manager
and several of the players prophesied that it
would prove a flat failure. The tale shows
that in Addition to the genius, to write the
play the kind-hearted little Irishman had to
exercise a great deal of courage, perseverence
and self-confidence to push It to final success.
The love affair with the sweet Jessamy Bride
is too pretty to be epitomized, and the book is
well worth reading for Us clever guess at the
romance of Goldsmith's life.
A FRENCH-CANADIAN STORY.
TIIE POMP OF THE LAVILETTE& By Gil
bert Parlcer. Bostou and New York: Lamson.
Wolff e <fe Co. For sale in this City by Payot,
Upham & Co.
The great success of "The Spats of the Mighty"
will make the public willing to try another
novel from this clever author. This story
covers incidents of the rebellion of the French
against English rule in Canada. There are
some unusual characters placed before the
reader with fine brevity of description. One
of the principal persons is a nobly born but
unfortunate man, who is described as having a
face without care, without fear, without vice
and without morals. â¢â¢For," the author in
forms us, "the absence of vice with the ab
sence of morals are not incongruous in a hu
man face." The exceeding ardor of the na
ture of a little French-Canadian girl, who is
one of the main characters of the s ory, Is partly
revealed by this scrap of solilcquy from her
regarding a man who is bankrupt in both
hea.th and purse: "What do they know about
love! What would they do for it? I'd have
my fingers chopped off one by one for it. I'd
bieak every one of the ten commandments for
it I'd lose my soul for it. I've got twenty times
as much heart as any one of them."
Here is a bit of moralizing on human nature
that is interesting as coming from one who
has achieved fame in fiction: "She was lying
to him now becauseâ well, because she loved
him. Like the majority of men, when women
who love them hÃve lied to them, they have
seen in it a compliment as strong as the act
was weak. It was more to him now that this
girl should love him than that she should be
upright, or moral, or truthful. Such is the
egotism and the vanity of man."
QUEEN OF THE ANTILLES.
CUBA IN WAR TIMK-By Richard Harding
Uavii. New York: K. H. Kussell.
Part of this book was originally published in
the form of letters from Cuba to the New York
Journal, and some additions have been made
which were chiefly suggested by questions
put to the correspondent upon his return.
The book is well illustrated by Frederic Rem
ington. The situation of affairs on the un
happy Island is very clearly and concisely
given. The commercialism and cruelty of the
Spanish officers are described in a way to
arouse sympathy for the insurgents. Some of
thu chnpters giving most graphic descriptions
are "The Fate of the Pacifieos," -'Along the
Troche," "The Question of Atrocities" and
â¢'Tiie Death of Rodriguez." This last Is espe
cially interesting, and if in place of being fact
it had been merely a piece of fiction it is so
vividly told as to be worthy of careful perusal.
RAMBLING TALKS.
NATURE IN A CITY YAKD-By Charles M
skinner. New York: The Century Company.
Price $1.
A book full of rambling writings by a
Brooklyn journalist. They are the fruits of
his leisure time reflections. His field of ob
servation is limited toacitybek yard. The
book is very fluent, but seems to have no
serious reason for existence. The style,
though rather flippant and commonplace,
would have done well enough if the writer
had anythine of importance to say, but Is
scarcely brilliant enough to make his wander
ing discourses readable.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 2, 1897.
MAGAZINES FOR MAY.
ATLANTIC MONTHLY.
In the May number the Atlantic Monthly
will contain two instructive articles on life in
rural New England and the problems present
ed by the rush of the population to great
cities. Oiie of these articles is a study oi are
mote village which has not been reached by
modern methods of life. The native charac
teristics, which were not very long ago shared
by a large part of the rural population ol New
England, now seem so remote as almost to be
regarded as curiosities. This sympathetic
sketch shows tne life of the village in all iis
phases. The otner study is of a farming
town which . has indeed kept somewhat
apace with modern progress, but still retails
the features of the old rural life. Its accurate
and faithful pictures of these country towns
now seem almost like descriptions of another
civilization, so far removed are they from the
characteristic modern bustle of city life. All
the important problems which have risen in
the recent shifting of population and changes
of industry are illustrated in these sketchesâ
the drifting awaj from the old religious faiths,
the loss of leadership to a certain extent, the
decline of local patriotism from its old
fervor. Yet there are many attractive
features of this life â the leisure that
the people have, their good-nature, the
companionship and the old-fashioned neigh
borly qualities which they retain. In con
trast with these studies is a description of
"teal Utopias in the Arid West," by William
F.. Smythe, which gives a description of life in
Greeley, Colo., and an explanation of the de
velopment of a rational approach to com
munism in the fruii-growlng settlements of
Southern California. Besides those articles
the May Atlantic will contain an explanation
of how art may play its proper part In our
public schools, by Mrs. Sarah W. Whitman: an
account of Nausen's heroic journey and his
scientific achievements by Professor N. S._
Shaler of Harvard, besides short stories, lit
erary articles and a characteristic paper on
the Japanese city of Izumo by Lafcadio Hearn.
THE CENTURY.
The Century for May contains a group of
three papers dealing in an authoritative wry
with a fresh topicâ the scientific use of kites.
J. B. Millet writes on "Scientific Kite-flying,"
with special reference to the experiments at
the Blue Hill Observatory, near Milton, Mass.
Leutenant H. D. Wise, U. S. A,, makes a rec
ord of his own experiments on Governors
Island, including an account of his ascentâ
the first in America and the most notable yet
made. William A. Eddy writes of "Photo
graphing From Kites," giving an accoant also
of his experiments in telephoning and tele
graphing through lines suspended from kitesâ
the first known experiments of the sort. Lieu
tenant-General Schofield contributes the first
of his records of unwritten history, his article
dealing this month with "The Withdrawal of
the French From Mexico," and including nn
important letter from General Grant to General
Sheridan showing the attitude of the United
States Government toward the French inva
sion. A supplementary article by the present
Minister of Mexico to the United Staie*, Mr.
Romero, sets forth his beliet that the fall of
the second empire was closely related to the
events described by General Schofield. Affairs
in the East are treated in an article on "Crete,
the Island of Discord," by Demetrius Kniopo
thakes, a Greek writer educated in America,
now resident in Athens, and In a taper on
"The Royal Family of Greece," by Professor
Benjamin Ide Wheeler, late of the Amer
ican School ol Athens, who writes from per
sonal acquaintance with King George and the
Greek Princes. Taere is an illustrated de
scription by Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer of
"A suburban Country Place," the residence of
Professor Charles S. Sargent at Brookline,
Mass., and Colonel George E. Waring Jr.
writes "Bicycling Through the Dolomites,"
General Horace Porter's "Campaigning With
Grant" deals with the siege of Petersburg, and

, Dr. Mitchell's novel, "Hugh Wynne," Is now
well along In the Revolutionary period.
LIPPINCOTT'S.
The complete novel in the May issue o
Lippincott's is "Jason Ilildreth's Identity."
It is a story of unusual origina.ity and power,
turning on an incident winch has had pre
cedents in real lifeâ the loss of memory and
personal identity; but the plot is so deeply
and skillfully laid that the last pages will
come as a surprise to almost every reader. "A
Stur Route Case," by Mary E. Stickney, is a
tale of old days Id the West, when mail
coaches were "held up" by a.ents of their
owners. "Martliy's Dress," by Carrie Blake
Morgan, is a pathetic and effective piece
of woik by one who never, in prose
or verse, writes otnerwise than weil.
Joseph A. Allsheler, in "My Pennsylvan
ian," deals humorously with a supposed
incident of the Revo.uuonary War. William
Thomson revives old memories of Indian fight
ing "On the Santa Fe Traii." In his narratives
the savages are always punished aud me
whites come oft' safe. Alva Fitzpatrick traces
the fortunes of certain "French Pioneers in
America," i. c., Nepo:eonic exiles who came to
Alabama after the downfall < I the empire. It
is a curio is by-etiitpier ofj Southern annals.
Mrs. Scnuyler Van Rensselaer writes of the
"Beginnings of Liberty in New York," ques
tioning some ussertioÃS of S. G. Fisher. "Life
in tne Cottoa Belt" is described with full
knowledge by Francis Albert Doughty, ond
"Early Man in America," a more remote, but
not less interesting theme, by Harvey B.
Bashore.

FRANK LESLIE'S.
America has its ensues us well as European
countries, and those- on the Hudson River
have as interesting a stoi y in a way as tho
famous bui. dings on the Rhine. John P. Ril
ter tells this story in a liberally illustrated
article entitled "Some American Castles."
in the May number of Frauk Leslie's Popular
Monthly. The "F.iir Maids of Morocco" are
pictured and described by Frederick A. Ober,
in the ssaiae number. Another Important
article is "Japan's Three Invasions ol Korea,"
by Teiichi Yamagata, a relative of the great
Japanese Marquis. It is accompanied by
many excellent pen-and-ink drawings
of views in Japan and Korea. The
attractive series of papers on "American Uni
versities and Colleges" is continued with an
article on the University of Minnesota, by
John Cochrane Sweet. A well-know,n theoso
phist. Marian F. Gltt, tells in an interesting
way "What Theosophy Means." There are ar
ticles on "Constantinople's Streets," "The
Mythical Manoa," "Cabs and Cabmen," "Two
Arabian Weddings," etc., and a number of
short stories, including one by the new and
promising writer, John J. A'Becket. A new
serial story entitlo-i "The Catspaw," by Fred
erick R. Burton, begins iv this number, and
its opening chapters give indications of a
stirring and powerful novel.
ST. NICHOLAS.
The May St. Nicholas cpens with a frontis
piece, "The Maypole Dance," by C. Relyea,
illustrating a poem with the same title by Cor
nelia Walter MtCleary. "How Cousin Marion
Helped" is a story for girls by Alice Ualch Ab
bot. Dr. Emily G. Hunt describes an odd pet
of some of her young friends in New Jersey,
"A White Red Squirrel." George B. Smith, in
a paper entitled -'General Grant's White Moun
tain Ride," tells of a remarkable couch trip
made by the President irom the village of
Bethlehem to the Profile House. The distance
was eleven miles, and the road was rough and
mountainous, but there were eight excellent
horses attnehed to the coach, and the trip
was made In record-breaking time â less
than one hour. Frank H. Spearman, in "A
Snifting Boundary," describes some of the
freaks of the Missouri, and in particular of '
one by which a corner of lowa wÂ»s cut off
from the rest of the State and left high and
dry on the western side of the river. Readers
of the magazine have been interested in a
number of papers on "Historic Dwarf?," by
Mary Shears Roberts. In the present issue
Mrs. Roberts relates the romantic story of
Casan, a lmie Tartar dwarf who was in the
service of the great Genghis Khan. "The Fes
tival of Eggs" is a story of life on the Easter
Islands, in the South Pacific, written by
Charles F. Holder. In "Master Skylark,"
John Bennett's serial, there is given a glimpse
of Shakespeare at one of Queen Bess' festivals
on the Thames. "The Last Three Soldiers,"
in Mr. bheiton's serial, find a great treasure,
which, owing to their isolated position, they
put to novel uses. Frances Courtenay Baylor's
story of "Miss Nina Barrow" develops in in
terest
McCLLRE'S.
The May number of McClure's Magazine is
especially Interesting in the matter of por
traits of famous people. In illustration of a
paper by Miss TarbeJ on the remarkable work
of G. C. Cox in photographic portraiture there
are truly speaking likenesses ot Donald G.
Mitchell ("Ik Marvel"), Walt Whitman,
Eleanora Duse, Henry Ward Beecher and
others, and a series of life portraits of Daniel
Webster exhibit that most august and impres- ;
sive of great men at close intervals from
middle life to the year Of his death, Some of
the Webster portraits have never before been
published, and all have interesting histories,
which are iet forth In notes by Charles Henry
Hart. An article that everybody will read
with eager interest is Ray Stannard Baker's
account of the pursuit aud capture of Booth
after his assassination of Lincoln and of Ms
death and burial. There has been more or
less written on this subject before, but
Mr. Baker is a relative of Colonel L. C. Baker
and Lieutenant L. B. Baker, the two men who,
as Government detectives, were specially
charged with the pursuit and capture and
who themselves disposed of Booth's body.
The paper is based upon information derived
by the writer directly from them and never
before published; and it gives, undoubtedly,
the fullest and most accurate account of
Booth's last days and death that has yet ap
peared. After lying for many years' under the
stone floor of the old penitentiary at Wash
ington, Booth's body, Mr. Baker discloses, is
now buried in Baltimore. Other features of
this number of McClure's are a most in
telligent and comprehensive review of the
second administration of Mr. Cleveland, by
Carl Schurz: an account of Grant's disheart
-1 eninc search for service at the beginning of
the war, by Hamlin Garland; and fiction of
the most stirring and romantic quality by
Conan Doyle, Robert Louis Stevenson and
Rudyard Kipling.
Greece will be full ot English-speaking nov
elists at the present rate. Rurtyard Kipling
has gone there to write for the London Times,
Stephen Crane went before him, and Richard
Harding Davis is going. Mr. Crane will prob
ably not describe the real battles he sees any
better than the imaginary oues tbat he lias
written about.
HLRE AND THERE.
Captain Mnhan's '-Life of Nelson" has been
received in England with an enthusiasm that
is described as little short of irenzy by the
English critics.
Austin Dot;son is preparing a volume of his
selected poems, and in it will ba included the
poem written by him for the Johnson col
lection at Oxford.
Tolstoi's "Ivan the Fool" has been drama
tized by Dr. Arnold Eiioart, and will be pub
lished in book form. It has, we believe, had
one performance in London.
Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. will publish Clem
ent Shorter's Lives of Sir Walter fccottand
Lord Byron, in the series of works on English
literature in the Victorian era.
B. O. Flower, recently the editor of The
Arena, has published a prospectus lor a new
review. It will be "an exponent of the new
political and social uprising."
The late Edmond de Goncourt left important
ad'titions to the famous Journal dcs Gon- |
court. According to his instructions, this
supplementary matter is to be published in
1916.
Mrs. Flora Annie Steel has dram atired her
famous story, "On the Face of the Waters," at
the request of an eminent London manager.
If the play is as successful as the book has
been Mrs. Steel need ask nothing more.
Pierre Loti, who is at present on active
service on the French warship Javelot, has
produced a new book, "Ramuntcho" â a study
of Biscayan landscape and munnerÃ. Gaston
Dcschamps declares it to be "the true Loti,
the Loti of the old manner."
Mark Twain is still living in retirement In
England. He can be reached only through
his publishers, Chatto & Windus. "My book
will soon be finished," ho wrote a few weeks
since to an intima'e friend. It will be issued
by his publishers in Hartford.
With the idea of making a truly patriotic
his ory of the United States, Professor J. B.
McMaster of the University of Pennsylvania
has prepared such a work. It was written at
the suggestion of the Grand Army of the Re
public. "My Country, Right or Wrong," may !
want adjusting when history has to be written.
] The Kelmscott Press announces in a circular
dated February that the "Sigurd," which Mr.
Morris was keenly anxious about, is to be pub
lished. It will not, however, take the sump
tuous form its Rnthor intended for it. The
edition is to be limited to 160 copies at six j
guineas, and six copies on vellum at twenty
guineas.
What a chance there will be now for the Em
bassador to the court of St. James to sell his
"Pike County Ballads." The Messrs. Rout
iedge announce in London Colonel Hay's
"Ballads." "Little Breeches" will thus ap
pear, but the United States Embassador does
not disfigure himself, even at a Queen's levee,
in smallclothes.
A biography of that very remarkable man,
Cecil Rhodes, is to be published. Dr. Jameson
will contribute reminiscences. Mr. Rhodes'
characteristics can b3 better understood when
it is remembered that he has for on objective
idea the building of a railroad from the Cape
of Good Hop 1 ? to Cairo, with, say, 500 miles of
British territory on each side of the track.
The funds for the Oliver Goldsmith Memo
rial Window, to be placed in tl-.e church at his
native place, Pallas, County Longford, Ire
land, have been fully subscribed. Tne ma
jority of the subscribers are Englishmen of
letters. The design ssnt in by a south of Ire
land firm hns been selected. The window is
to be placed in the church near "Sweet
Auburn."
A monument to Guy de Maupassant will be
placed in the Pare Morceaux alter the closing
of the Champs-Elysees Salon, where it is at
present exhibited. It is the work of M. Raoul
Verlet, and represents a. young woman seated
on a circular bench, and leaning agHinct a col
umn on which is placed a bust of Maupassant.
In her hand she holds a half-closed book,
"Notre Cceur." The likeness of the bust is
said to be striking.
TourguenefFs letters to George Sand are
being prepare! for publication. The bulk of
the correspondenca runs on questions of
literary history and criticism, but the Russian
novelist also sets forth his views on senti
mental s jbjects. His letters to E;nile Zola nre
shortly to see the light, but it is probable thai
they will be txtensively edited, as the judg
ments they contain on many famous contem
porary men of letters are believed to be most
outspoken.
According to the English University Exten
sion, a list has been published of what, in their
estimation, are the best historical novels.
Kingsley's "Hereward the Wake" is men
tioned as the best picture of the eleventh cen
tury, Scott's "Ivanhoe" &% the best of the
twelfth, Kingsley'i< "Westward Ho!"and Scott's
"Kenilwortli," nre given for the sixteenth,
Shorthouse's "John Inglesant," Scott's "Old
Mortality," and Blackinore's "Lorna Doone"
for the seventeenth, and Thackeray's "Es
mond" for tha eighteenth.
There has been some discussion as to
-whether a great find had or had not been
made in a small four-leaf pamphlet whicrt
some thought was the original issue of Gray's
"Elegy." Edmund Gosse writes in the
Athenseum that the work is only "an ex
trcmeiy early piracy of the 'Elegy,' probably
struck off within a few days of the publication
of the first quarto, stnee it bears several of the
familiar stigmata of that edition. But its text
is wholly without independent value, and we
must look at it merely as a litersry curiosity
of no intrinsic importance."
We all know who it is who quotes the Bible
for his own purposes, and also that "any ex
cuse is better than none." But a New York
"drunk and disorderly" in his defense stated
that "he obeyed the teachings of the Bible,"
and requested the loan of the Bible whÂ»,ch was
ordinarily used for administering oaths.
Without a moment's hesitation the prisoner
turned to Proverb-, xxxi and read the sixth
and seventh verses to the astonished magis
trate: "Give strong drink unto him that is
ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of
heavy heart-. Let htm drink and forget his
poverty, and remember his misery no more."
The magistrate listened and uttered the one
word "Discharced."
Hall Came arrived In London for his annual
holiday in Easter week. It may be presumed,
therefore, that he has brought "The Christian"
to a conclusion, says the New York Critic. It
is strange how little notice a story attracts
during its serial course; but one energetic
critic, who reals every paper on the stalls,
assures me that 'The Christian" is likely to
prove more popular and to attract more atten
tion than any of its author's former stories.
It seems that Mr. Came has collected an im
mense amount of "cor>y" for this work, which
reflects almost every side ol London life, and
the chapters yet to appear are said ;o be by
for the most striking in the work. The title is
in itjclf enough to make the fortune of the
book with the circulating libraries.
LITERARY NOTES.
Anthony Hope is writing a new story which
is said to have a less fantastic plot than his
recent books. It will probably be called "Born
in the Purple."
The American Publishers* Corporation has
issued, from entirely new plates, a iaper-cov
ered edition of Jessie Fothergill's notable book
"The First Violin," said to be the best musi
cal novel yet published. The book is illus
trated with a sixteen full-page half-tone en
gravings.
Captain Mahan's new work "Tho Llfo of
Nelson," just published by Little, Brown &
Co., has been heartily received in Americ-i
and in England, and the first edition of 5000
copies was exhausted before puMication. Tho
author is nt present stflying in Boston, being
encaged in delivering a series of lectures on
"Naval Warfare" in the Lowell Institute
course.
Among the forthcoming works to be pub
lished by Little, Brown <fc Co. is a new histori
cal romance by George R. R. Rivers, author ol
"The Governor's Garden," entitled "Captain
Shay, a Popu.ist of 1786." The scenes of the
story are chiefly laid in Boston and Peters
ham, Mass., and the motive is the discontent
of the farmers and the noted "Saay's Rebel
lion" which arose from it.
At this time when polar expeditions as well
as new pans or schemes for reaching the pole
are subjects of much interest, Herbert D.
Ward's popular story, "A Dash to the Pole,"
issued by the American Publishers' Corpor
ation, will find many more delighted readers.
The book is liberally illustrated and has a lull*
page picture of the Aeropole (: irship), which,
in the story, reaches its destination.
Literary men and especially journalists will
appreciate the new Year Book wn eh the Mac-
millan Company announces. We say new,
since it is the first issue in a new form thor
oughly remodeled and a great improvement
upon the earlier editions, a' though it retains
its original title, "Who's Who?" Formerly a
little more than a collection of tttbles of the
Peerage, with the ormy, navy and law lists
and various political tables, it is in its en
larged form a biographical dictionary of liv
ing; celebrities and especially those who are
prominent in literature, arts and sciences. Of
tho brief notices the vast maj >rity ore auto
biographical and the information thus placed
so conveniently in the hands of the public
in "Who's Who? " 1897, is simDly invaluable.
A good move is announced by the publishers
of What to Eat, Minneapolis. From and after
July 1 the magazine will print no advertise
ments of food or drink except such as are of ap
proved merit and value in their especial lines.
If any article of food is impure it will not be ad
vertised in tnis magazine at any price. If any
beverage or preparation, medical or otherwise,
is not what it pretends to be, it will gain no ad
mission to the columns of What to Eat. The
publishers are determined to enforce this rule
so rigorously that the appearance of an ad in
What to Eat will be a guarantee of the purity
and merit of the article advertised, and while
it will cost a good deal to enforce this regula
tion, the? believe in the end it will pay them,
as well as benefit the public.
Lieutenant-General John M. Schofleld will
contribute to tne Century for May a chapter
of secret history entitled "The Withdrawal of
the French from Mexico." It was intended by
the United fctates Government that General
Schofield should take charge of volunteer
troops to drive the French out of Mexico, but
afterward he was sent on a confidential mis
sion to Paris to induce Emueror Napoleon to
order a peaceful withdrawal. General Scho
field will give a hitherto unpublished letter
from General Grant to General Sherman, then
in command of ihe military division of the
gulÂ», showlrg to what extremes the Govern
ment was willing to go to accomplish its pur
pose. In a supp ementary article Mr. Romero,
the Mexican Minister to the United States,
will give his view of the relation between the
withdrawal of the French and the fall of the
Second Empire.
A peculiarly delightful book of travel and
sightseeing has been written by Mr. John A.
Logan Jr., whose "In Joyiul Russia" describes
tne splendid ceremonies at the coronation of
the Czar, and also pictures Russian social Hie
m town and country. Mr. LiKan's credentials
j:ave him special facilities lor seeing every
thing best worth se.'ing. He has not dealt with
questions of politics. He does not
follow other writers in treating of
resources, topography or educational and
governmental themes. Ha describe, the*
greatest fete of the century, perhaps
of history, and ia a frank and entertaining
way he teils his readers of the Russians ana
their homes as they appear under such condi
tions. The methods of amusement, and the
characteristics of life in Moscow and in the
country, are set forth with a freshness and
vividness which impart to his work a peculiar
charm. The book contains fifty illustration!!,

"Plasmocytes" is the title of the last book
Issued by the Academy ol Sciences. Of course,
the average person does not know what a plas
mocyte If, so it will be necessary to state that
the work is by Dr. Eisen and that it is an ex
haustive explanation of his great discovery in
regard to the independence of centrosome in
animal cells.
An account of this great discovery was pub
lished exclusively in The Call about a year
ago, but, of course, the limited space that
could be given to it permitted only of a gen
eral outline. The book just issued is most ex
haustive and contains two page litbograpns
from Dr. Kisen's original water-color draw
ing. This work was done in Frankiort-on-
Main and is of the highest order.
Since Dr. Eisen made his discovery in regard
to the independence of the centroÃome his
subsequent investigations have only strength
ened his theory so that the discovery must bÂ«
regarded as the greatest bioloeical work of the
century.

beauty of bird and blossom, is held very

the memory of that mother, named Mary,
who watched beside the tomb of her son

been given to this month in honor of a

The Stone for May.
The emerald is of a brilliant green and
is inferior in value only to tne ruby and
the diamond. It is classed with the berry
and is transparent or translucent.
The emerald was highly iirized by the
anci nts and was supposed by them to
possess certain virtues, such as being good
for tne eyes and to drive away evil spirits.
The finest specimens are found in South
America. Siberia and India. The emer
ald looks best when set with diamonds.
May Day.
It was a beautiful morning on tbe first
of May. Just the nicest day that ever was
for a picnic. So the little children in the I
village of Mountain Glen thought. The
day before had been very showery and
dark clouds filled tne <tky when it was not '
raining. 80 it had b9en thought best to !
make no plans for Mayday.
Hut now ihe sun was shining so bright j
. and the sky was very clear and bhie, with !
just a few tiny specks of white here and <
theie.
Some half dozen boys and girls were
gathered on Squire Young's lawn, talking
to the village lavorite, Lily Young.
'Oh, it does seem too bad to stay at ;
home to-day," she cried.
"Ye<<; if we only might have a picnic or
a berrying party," answered Jack Lyon.
"It's so dull when one has nothing to do."
"Well," said Charlie Graham, "it's
e-arly yetâ just 20 mmutes past 9," '
looking at his watch.
"Let's run home, persuade our dear \
mammas to give us some luncheon, get }
our Dtetty May baskets that we used in
the carnival last year and go to the woods
in search of vines and flowers. I am,
afraid 'tis too early for berries," sug
gested Ruth Graham. "We could all !
meet here at 10 o'clock and go together." j
"Jolly 1" "Just the thing!" cried the!
children, as they scattered to their !
homes.
At the appointed time the merry little I
party started from Squire Young's, chat
ting, laughing and carrying their dainty I
baskets.
Wbcfe they reached the edge of the
.forest they separated into groups of two
or three. "Be sure to come to the 'big
tree' at half-past 12, â¢ called Charlie, as j
â¦ hey were mov.ng away.
"Oh, won't that be fine, to eat under
that dear old tree again after all the
storms of winter!" Lily exclaimed.
The hour quickly pas?ed, and it was
a hungry crowd that gathered beneath
the gnarled Dranches of the monster oak
when luncheon-time came.
Jack ad been fortunate enough to find
a handful of wild strawberries, of which
lie was very proud, because the rest had
laughed at him when he suggested a
bsrrying party. He was not ?eifi-<h at
all, though, for he divided his find amone
his friends.
The flowers were first sprinkled with
water from the brook near by and then
the "good things" from lunch-baskets
appeared for a little while and then dis
appeared forever.
"Somehow," remarked Dick Gray,
"things taste better outdoors. 1 '
"Yes, 1 think so too," assented Ida
Croker.
After lunch they rested under the
shade, ana riddles, conundrums and
jokes were passed around. Then more
flowers wer â  eatkerel, and lo 1 it was
time to start for home.
'I think we have had a lovely time,"
saia one.
"Yes, indeed, considering we mads no
preparations whatever," answered Jack.
"Sometimes I tfalnk we should always
enjoy things more if ;hey came like this,
as kind of a little surprise," romanced
quiet Nellie Gray.
"I believe you're rleht, Nellie," said
Charlie; "but now w&at are we going to
do with our flowers, girls and boys and
fellow-citizens?' 1
Justt en th-y were passing the cottage
where poor old Mrs. Melton lived. The
old lady was sitting by the window and
her face lighted up with a sad smile at
the sight of tbe happy youti.s. Mrs.
Melton was a cripple, her lower limbs
beinj; withered and useless, and she could
only leave the house when carried in the
strong arms of some triend.
Mar:y of our gay young folks had often
heard their parents tell of how she was
once a beautiful girl, tbe light and pride
of the village; of how she had married,
and then one night tne dread lire demon
had swept down upon the little home, and
how in a short time he had torn from her
loving arms husband and child and left
her a poor, helpless cripple. All this and
more they knew, and now, when they saw
the -weet smile on the patient face,
Charlie's question was answered. "We'll
give them to her," sof:ly whispered Nellie.
Their gentle rap on the door was answered
Dy a 90ft "come in."
"We've brought you some May flowers,
Mrs. Melton, and hope you'll enjoy them."
Soon ncr table was covered and her lap
rilled with the fragrant b!oÂ«scms. As the
children left t: c hucabie home with the
words "God bless you, dear?," ringing in
their ears, they made up their minds to
see that Widow Meloa had floaers beside
her ever? day dunn? the springtime. So
ended Mayd.-iy in Mountain Glen.

Mamma's Birthday.
BY E. A.
A tap at the door.
"All rient!" ii the answer from one
snow-white bed, the same words being
laintJy echoed from two otners.
They were uttered in rather drowsy
tones, bat the three sisters quickly re
member how imperative it is to ri-e early
aud make their purchases for "mamma's
birthday."
"Suppose we go first to the florist's,"
suggested Sibyl Heathcote, the eldest, as
they set forth, "/or the fancy stores may
not be open at this early nour, and Josie
will be so long in making her selection. '' ;
"You are under a mistake this time,"
said Josephine, "/or I was smarter than
either of you, and slipped out last evening
to select my gift, ana finally decided upon
p. pair of exquisite vase?. So now I haTe
only to call and pay for them."
The dwelling-house of the Heatbcotes
was situated In the suburbs of the town,
and the three girls soon reached the
florist's. How sweet was the early spring
morning, and how lovely the rich hues of
those tropical blossom?, peeping through
their glass prison.
"1 think," said Bibyt, "that, instead of
the plants and Swiss tlower-stand, I shall
have a magnificent bouquet."
"Oh, Sibyl," exclaimed May, the young
est sister, "don't you remember that I
was t â¢ buy the bouquet? '
"Well, you can take the flower-stand
and plants."
"But. sister," expostulated May, "I hare
only one dollar; that will not purchase
lie stand, and you are ever so much
richer than I am."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 2, 1897.
"Perhaps I may change my mind, nnd
I also want to buy something for myself.
"Then will you lend me a small sum,
Jcsie?' '
"Upon my word. May, that's the very
request I was about to make of you, for
when looking at those vases 1 priced some
pretty ornaments for my dressing-table,
and mnst have them !'
May had often sympathized with Cinde
rella when called upon to relinquish her
own wishes and projects to her more self
ish sisters. Here was another surrender.
Oh. when would the fairy godmother and
the glass slippers be her reward?
"You know," continued Josephine,
"that grandpapa will be here to-day, and
as you are his favorite, just ask him lor
five dollars; then have that Swiss flower
stand sent home and pay fcr it in the
evening."
"No," replied May, "mamma would pre
fer going without my present, rather
than I should get into debt. But I think
it most unkind of Sibyl. She knew I had
fixed upon a bouquet, and that the dollar
note Ob, goodness, I have dropped it!"
"Search in your pocket, May."
"No, no! It was in my hand.' 1
"Miss, miss!" called out a childlike
voice.
And two little boys were running along
as fast a? their poor, worn-down shoas
could carry them.
''We saw you drop your monej 1 , miss,"
! said the elder, "and called out, but you
did not hear us. Here it is."
"You are two pood, honest little fel
; lows!" cried warm-hearted May, "and I
don't believe you nave a cent iv the world
; nor even had a bit of breakfast."
"Indeed, and you're right, miss. Bat
we're going a strawberrv-pirking on a
j farmer's patch, and he'll pay us to-night."
"And have you a mother? And where
do you live?"
"Just over there in that little cabin.

baby's awful sick. It's only last week

father was buried, and that took all our
bit of money."
"Take t;.is dollar, my poor boy, and run
with it as fast as ever you can to your
mother, ana here are a few pennies to buy
a little bread for yourselves."
"Well, May," said Sibyl, "while you
stan<l hero playing the part of Lady
Bountiful I shaii go within for the bou
quet, for of course you can no longer dis
pute my right. Having spent all your
money."
"Poor May!" exclaimed Josephine.
"Poor Msy 1" In all the fourteen years
of her young life sue had never felt >o
rich.
"Bat mamma's birthday gift!" con
tinued her sister. "Where is that to come
from ?"
"I shall come home in about an hour
and brinx it witii me. Good-by, sisters.
A'k cook to save me some breakfast."
Sibyl raised her pretty eyebrows in
silent wonder and opened the florist's
door, Josephine iollowing. They could
not understand the finer nature and gen
erou.i impulses oÂ« their younger sister, and
as dear little May is our heroine we will
leave the relation of how their presents
were received to the imagination of oar
readers, and follow her footsteps along a
little winding path, which led to a wooded
glen, where all nightlong
â¢sMVU'jft I,*1 ,* ' â¢â  'â¢â ' : The dew stole up â¢
From the fresh daughters of the earth, and beat

a n.i bent them with the blossoms 10 their dreams.
There they were, the fair sweet flowers
of tho springtide, some coyly peeping
from amid their shrines of moss and
leaves at the foot of an old torest tree,
while othersâ
Oh, they looked upward in every placet
spangling tue grÂ«au turf like bo many
earthly stars.
What next did May do? Why, she ran
down to a brook that all day long plashed
over its rocky bed, singing as it went
To the tall graM and wild flowers
That blossomed ai its sUe.
And there, amid those many lakelet?,
was the water lily's home. One "stately
river queen" should by royal right form
the center of May's bouquet.
Then on the banks grow delicate fern
tufts and light spiral grasses. So when
sitting down to group her gathered treas
ures she no longer wished for Sibyl's trop
ical beauties.
"Any one who had the money," she re
flected with pardonable scorn, "might
procure those; but how few care to explore
the lonely haunts of my wild darlings!
And then," prattled on the girl, with only
the flowers for her listeners, "that rustic
basket I bought for my bouquet is far
more suitable for these, while the vines
and grasses will trail over itâ oh, bo
lovely I"
'â¢What is this I hear, my child ?" asked
Mrs. lletthcoie. "Your sisters tell me
you gave away all your money and parted
from them, saying you were going in
search of my birthday gift."
May related the story; then brought
forth her basket of wild flowers. The sun
shine had dried the early dewdrops t:iat,
when gathered, had trembled on their
leaves. But holy as heaven's tears were
thoÂ»e which fell from the fond mother's
eyes as she blessed her kind-hearted and
loving child.â Golden Days.
Going a-Maying
Many people go out into the woods and
fields on the first day of May to gather
flower?.
They call it "going a-Maying."
This is done a great deal in England.
Mayday parties are also very common
there. A little girl is chosen as queen,
then she Is crowned with flowers and the
other children dance merrily around her,
ready ana willing to obey her slightest
wish.
Years and years ago even grown people
all over England used to celebrate the lit
of May.
They went out early in the morning and
gathered the flowers with which to trim
the doors ami windows of their home.
They also carried or sent bouquets to their
friends.
In every village throughout the country
stipftd a Maypole as high as the mast of a
ship. This was decorated on the festal
day with wreaths and ribbons.
A throne of green was erected for the
queen, on which she sat and watched the
merry young folks ns they danced around
the pole.
The milkmaids wore dainty white caps
and aprons, and drove their cows ihroa.'h
the streets, the meek-eyed animals having
their horns hung with garlands of bright
blossoms.
The whole day was spent in feasting and
dancing by the villagers, and sometimes
even the king and queen won d join in the
fun and sport.
Nowadays very few Maypoles are to be
found in England.
The preity cus:om of sending dainty
baskets of pretty, fragrant blossoms, tho
handles tied with ribbon, as a May greet
ing to one'n friend*, is growing in favor in
our own country. How pleasant if the
recipient ba an invalid! Think of tuis,

Evening Song.
As a babe to the heart of its mother is pressed
In the sheltering arms ot night we rest,
Her lullaby song at eve we may hear.
Quietly listen as twilight draws near.
Oh rest theo, beloved, weary with care,
To dreamland betake theo ! in castles of air
Thou'lt wander, enchanted, wild and so free,
Child of my heart, joy is waiting for thee.
Night winds shall rock thee gently with care,
Angels shall whisper thee secrets so rare,
Strains of sweet music shall charm thy fond
ear,
Visions of beauty unthought of appear.
Space is unheeded and time is no more,
Like a bird on the wing thy spirit shall soar.
In dreamland earth's children gay holidays
keep.
Then peacefully sleep, beloved one, sleep.

THE LETTER
BOX
Calistoga, Cal., April 25, 1897.
Dear Editrets: For a long time I have been
trying to think of something Interesting to
write for the Letter Box, and now venture to
offer the following:
I shall tell you of a visit that I made to-day
with my father and mother. We started out
and drove along slowly, enjoying the after
noon and the changing scenery. Soon we
stopped before a large white house and were
met at the gate by a kindly old gentleman,
with white hair and blue eyes. He shook
hand* with us all. The first words he said to
me were, "I have often read of one Eva Na
vone in <he paper." I certalnlr should have
mnde some reply to this if matters had been
different, but he who spoke has been, so un

fortunate as to lose his hearing, so I msrely |
smiled and bowed to the remark and followed J
him to the house, where we were met by a j
motherly looking lady, who Is his wife. As j
we were walking he said several things to j
encourage me in "my efforts to write
poetry."
When we reached the Darlor he showed me
some pen work which his son had done, and i
also a card containing two of his poems, for j
Ira W. Adams is a poet, and Calistoga, ai.d j
even California, should be proud of him. :
After I had read the lovely verses I longed to I
tell him how well I liked them and the pic
tures but 1 knew I could not make him hear, .
so I did not try. Then he brought me several \
booklets of poetry written by his brother, for
the "spirit of poetry" seems to run in the
family, Mr. Adams having two brothers who,
he claims, write better poems than himself.
Then Master Charley was called in to play
for us on his violin. 1 thought he did re
markably well for a little fellow of six years.
No doubt he will be a line mus ician some day.
We were next shown some very pretty ;
drawings which Mr. Adams did in his younger i
days.
Aiter inspecting the flowers we started for :
home, well satisfied with our afternoon. Your !
friend, M. Eva Nayonk (C. R. c.)

I have solved some of the puzzles and next
time when I write I shall try to send a little j
story.

Fap.mington, Cal., April 19, 1897.
Dear Editor: As I have never seen any letters
from Facmington before, only one that my
brother wrote a long time ago, I thought that
I would write one. lam a little boy 10 years
old, and have two brothers. One is 16 months,
and my other brother is 13 years old. We
have grandfather living with us, and he has a
nice vegetable garden near our house. My big
brother and I go to school every day, and our
school isgoi:ig to close on the last of May.

tell you something of our valley. It is situated
seven miles east of Mi pitas. It is about three
miles long and one aud a half miles wide. It
is surrounded by hills and it is very pretty.
Waen it was first discovered Indians and
Spanish lived here. There are a great many

Building a pretty nest in the Tines on our

is a bird's nest with three eggs in It right out
side our schoolroom window.
I was down on the beach Saturday and
caught a fish. I had just put my line down,
when I felt a bite. I pulled It and there was a

Dear Editor: This is my first letter to you.
We have been taking The Call Ear several
yean, and I enjoy reading the toys' and girls'
page very much. I had many pretty Easter
eggs this year. The Saturday before Easter I
went up on a bill to pick some wild flowers,
and when 1 got home I made an Easter nesf.
The next morning I found two pretty colored
eggs in it. One was pink ar.d the other green.
I had pieced the basin on the porch so that the
little rabbits could see it, and I am sure the
little rabbits left the eggs there. I will close
my letter now, as it is getting late and I must
go to bed. I remain yours,

Address: Tomales, Maria County, CÂ»I â¢'THE STAGE
Denis O'Sullivan must have an enor
mous number of indulgent friends â md
d ed, the brim of bfs hat most be worn out
with taking it off to the feminine portion
crt them in" the street. He has indulgent
fnends enough to till the Tivoli at every
performance, and fresh cohorts of. them
have booked seats far into this week.
They may think the plot of "Shanuis
O'Brien" is barren and the music wanting
in melodic?. Jt may te their private
opinion that it is a question whether
"Insh subjects ran be Mjccessfully sub
jected to modern zed operatic treatment
ana secure jiopular results," and in their
secret Souls they may think "the opera is
nQt entitled to a place in high art." But
â¢What of that !
Thjpy will be true to their friend and ln
dufsently eiulure all the deficiencies of
"a show that will not meet with popular
favor," in order to testify their induipent
friendship for Denis O'Sullivan. The
linffOagenient at the Tivoli finds ii difficult
io supply all its. patronsâevery one of
them an individual friend of O'Sullivan,
and oiily there to .testify love and devo
tion to that youth â with seats. Strange
that people shoulit persist in patronizing
so dreary a performance, and very bad
taste in face of the assurance from know
ing ones that it would be a disnal failure.
I wonder whether that lying banshee had
ab-ytbini; to do with some of the criticisms
o.f "Shamus O'Brien" published on Tues
day morning. She certainly deceived
Bfaajnus and his wife, perhaps sde inspired
some of tho critics to propnesy that the
whole miserable show would come to
iiaught. Beware of lying spirits I
The dismal Banshee must have collab- ,
prated with the critic who seemed so
acutely annoyed that a young San Fran
ciscan: should come home from foreign
successes and be enthusiastically wel
comed by his fellow- townsmen. This
critic, whom I can imagine as a hopeless
dyspeptic, was evidently in terror lest the
barytone's cup would run over with too
much sweetness, so he thou htfully
dropped the following dash ot gail and
bitterness into it: "If the young man
were foolish enough to accept the spon
taneous welcome of tnose who love him 1
for what he may expect during the con- ;
tinuance of his engag ment he will soon ]
be disillusionized." 1 wonder what he j
meant by toon t Was it a question of ]
hours, or days, or weeas? Moralists tell ]
us that every one who gambles is either
a knave or a fool â ha is a knave if he
knows he will win, and he is a fool if he
doesn't. Those who prophesy boldly be
fore the event 111:1 st also come under one
of these heads. Oi course, if a man waits
to see which Way ihe wind is blowing, he
rui-ses the chance of saying, "I told you
60," but how fooiish he looks "when every
thing turns out contrary to his predic
tions 1
The dyreptic prophet who loretold the
downfa.l of Dems O'Suilivan guilelessly
remarks that Stanford's music is wanting
in melody, and that it Will disappoint
those who yearn lor "Killarney." Wonder
f.;:l and yet more wonderful! Think of a
nian who cntc zes opera with an air of
â wisdom, not knowing melody when he
hears :t ' I can quite believe that people
who went to "Suatuus O'Brien" expecting
it-string of I ri~h duties, and. "turns," as
they are given in music halls, would go
a\vay with & hungry, unsatisfied yearning,
and that Stanford's tunes would not
exactly liit the taste of those whose musi
cal aspirations soar no higher than "Just
Tell Them You Saw Me," "Mamie, Come
Kiss Your Honey Boy," and oiher gems
beloved of ttie vauievillers. I do not
think, however, that an amateur educated
up to the standard of â say of "The
Maiden's Prayer"â could spend an houT
over the pianoforte score of "Shamus
O'Brien," and afterward say.it wts not
melodious.
The score is simply saturated with
tune-, and a tune Is a tune, even if it does
not t;ckie every uneducated ear that it
: strikes. The tunes in "fcjhamus O'Brisn"
aie not of the kind that a messenger-boy
. would whistle the first time he heard
ttiem, and to tastes vitiated by slap-bang
music-hall duties the melody may actu
â ally not be apparent on a first or even a
second hearing, but "Sfranius O'Brien"' is
saturated with melo ty of a refined and
lasthiE kind, melody that Is jim as full of
tune as "Killarney," only we have had
.that pounded into our ears on hand
.:.organs and at amateur concerts for so
â  many years that the niost unmusical
listener does not fear, to put his fo<>t in it
when he proudly recognizes it, and ex
â  hibits his knowledge by remarking,
"That's 'Killarney.' "
The modern orchestration in "Shamus
OBrien"'is what worries and confuses
people who know nothing about modern
lyric comedy. They are blandly icnorant
ol the orchestral treatment used by ad
vanced operatic composers, and when the
orchestra does not follow the voices ser
vilely they fail to pick out the tunes.: I
think, though, that if selections from
"Shamus O'Brien" were played on hand
organs we ; should scon have every mes
senger-boy in town whistling the old
march, "Well, He'd Take Me by the
Hand," "I Can't Let Him Go," etc.
There is always a little army of atna
leurs in San Frar.c.jcu ready to give the
glad hand and the willing dollar to any
thing good in music. It was safe to pre
dict that tnese amateursâ friends of Denis
O'Sullivan or otherwiseâ would support
"Shsnius O'Brien," and appreciate the
BUbue beauties of the minor key and the
â crooning Erse melodies, out it was a toss
up whether the music would not roll over
the heads Without reaching the intellect
of the average Tivoii audience. Irish
music loves tne minor key, American
cumiHJ-ers are very apt to despise and
neglect it, and San Francisco, not being
musically biessed with a regular opera
season, has not been given a fair opportu
nity of acquiring a taste for modern ope
ratic methods. When we get that ta!k<-d-of
opera-house and have an annual season
people who write about music will learn
to know a tune when they hear it, how
ever modern the orchestral treatment,
ar.d they will not use "opera comique" i
and "comic opera" as interchangeable}
termsâ there is about as much difference
between thgro as between a horse chestnut
and a ch^istnut horse.
Pn the mean time Denis O'Sullivan's
"roving and indulgent frieuds" are giTillc
j'l-st â  aa much .outward and visible
appearance of popularity to Stan
ford's opera as it enjoyed in Lon
d.on,: Dublin, K.ew York and Ciiicago..
The TivoSi management is indeed for
tunate in having secured for its leading
man a sinzer who, hampered by a trem
olo, and an opera "that will not meet with
popular favor," can pack the tiieater at
every performance with his own personal
friends. Marie Evelyn.

The De Wolf Hoppers will nren to-mor
row evening in John Philip Sou9a's and
Charles Klein's comic opera, "El Gapitan."
The music is ju-it the kind that Sousa
would be expected to write, as it is lively
and melodious, and the greater portion of
it is written in march tempo, which gives
"El Capitan" a unique position among
modern comic operas. It is said that "El
Capitan" is apt to set the feet in rapid and
spirited motion.
Mr. K;ein, the autiior. of the book, has
written a libretto giving prominence to
the star and his little wife, Edna Wallace-
Hopper, as well as Nella Bergen, the new
prima donna, Edmund Stanley, Alice
Ho-mer and other principals in ttie cast.

George Osbourne will play the part of
Archibald Carlyle, the hero of the story ;
Adele B*lgarde will have the strong emo
tional part of Lady Isabel; Husro Toland

Following "East Lynne" at the Alcazar
a decided noveity will be produced in the
shape of a one-act Chinese drama, written
by Francis Powers, a young actor of the
company. It will be the fir^ t time in the
history of the stage tnat American actors
have anpeared in a Chin.-se play. The
drama is entitled '"The First Born," and
its scenes are. laid in Cninatown. The
plot deals with the feud of tfoe See Yup
and the 'Sam Yup tongs, and Mr. Powers
I has spent many months in studying the
[characteristics, of the Chinese. The
j scenery and costumes will be elaborate
ana correct and the patrousof the Alcazar
are promised a surprise in the way of
Oriental effects.
Qrar\d Opera-J-iouse.
"An American Hero," a play full of
startling -cenic effects, will be given at
the Grand Ooera-house this week. It is a
comedy-drama^ built on melodramatic
lines, and contains plenty oi fun and spe
cialties. There ar-j also some exciting
scenes, in which Harry Mortimer ai
Colonel Sidney Polk, a daring young
American, rescues distressed beauty in the
face of overwhelming obstacles. Inci
dentally there is a thrilling wreck scene,
a swim for life, a storm at sea and some
beautiful special scenery. Lorena Atwood
and Julia Blanc will be once more in thu
cast, and Harry Shock, a boy singer who
has just come from toe Princess Theater
of Leeds, England, it to have an impor
tant juvenile role.
Ji^oli Opera-J-louse.
The new romantic opera, "Shamos
O'Br.en," with the young California
barytone, Denis O'Sullivan, in the title
role, is evidently gratifying to the
theater-L'oers of this City, for in the long
history of the Tivoli Opsra-house there is

"Mulberry Bend," in which he plays a
Hebrew character drawn on "Samuel of
I'osen" lines. The cast of "Gentleman
Joe" engages over sixty people, and the

Vicker's Theater.
TWo Americarv Plays.
American managers continue persist
ently to co to Europe for plays, at least
half of which turn out to be complete
failures on this side of the Atlantic.
Meanwhile the proportion of American
plays that do yet a production continues
to obtain a greater average of success
than do the importations. The latest
hits in New York have b*en made by Dv
Souchet. author of "My Friend From In
dia," and by Madeline Lucette Ryley.
Dv Souchet has hit a hanpv vein in his
latest play. "The Man from Mexico." The
plot has not anything strikingly origina 1
about it, but the dialogue and situation s
are said to be screamingly funny, and the
merriment is kept up to the end.
Madeline Lucette Ryley's latest comedy,
''The Mysterious Mr. Bugle," has not
anything original about it either, but it is
cleverly woriced up and is providing
plenty of amusement for Rudiences nt the
Lyceum Theater. The Dramatic News
tell- the plot to the following way:
"Betty Fondacre is betrothed to Tom
Poi.inser, who is, however, compelled to
Keep his betrothal a secret because his
grandmother, who has made him her heir,
tnreatens to disinherit him if he contracts
any matrimonial all'ance before he has
arrived Â»t the age of 40 years. Tom, being
of a jealous disposition, induces Betty to
represent herself as a grass widow whose
husband, Mr. Bugle, is traveling on busi
ness. By this means he hopes to prevent
the possibility of other men indulging
in flirtations with Betty. A series
of amusing complications a-ise out
of the visit of Betty's cousin, Allen,
to her room by way of a window, his find
ing a burglar in the apartment, his lock
ing the crook in an adjoining chamber,
from which the man escapes, nnd the sad
den arrivjl of Tom while he i- discussing
the adventure with Betty. Allen has to
climb down a water pipe before Tom en
ters, but tne jealous lover has heard a
man's voice in conversation with Betty
and is determined to find out who the vis
itor was. Allen had also carried off the
key to the chamber in which ihe burelar
had been locked. The fun that follows
flows srora the hunt for the key and com
p ications which point to the existence of
a real Mr. Bugle. Of course, all ends hap
pily."
Dramatic Brevities.
Emily Banker is looking for a new play.
Mrs. John Drew will soon join the ranks ol

James J. Corbett evidently has lost none of
his popularity. At the Academy of Music in
the "Naval Cadet" Mr. Corbett received an
ovation last weekâ a positive ovation, which
showed how much the public appreciated
him.
Iris is the pretty rainbow-name which the
latest Miss Tree's godmotherâ the Duchess of

At last Isabelle Urquhart is really going to
act. She haÂ« always wanted to; she has al
ways been sure that she could. She never
liked just ".standing 'round" in comic ocera,
because she knew that she could do better
things, arnt now she is coing to play the lead
ing part in a sketch, even if she does have to
go to Keith's to do it.
The last performance by the Primrose &
West minstrels will take place at me Baldwin

Novel Entertainment for the Benefit
of tbe Children's Hos
pital.
Society, fashionable and always charita
ble, is actively interested in the gin er
hread fete to bo held at the Clark Crocker
residence, corner of Sutter and Octavia
streets, beginning Tuesday a week, the
proceeds to be devoted to that most
worthy of charities, the Children's Hos
pital.
A gingerbread fete, which is a Parisian
form of entertainment, is as gay and
bright and happy as anything that bears
the stamp of the jolly French capital. It
is to last five day?, from the 11th to th c
15th, inclusive, and is to continue during
the afternoon and evening of those days.
The ladies having the affair in charge
have been laboring; with tha zeal that be
tokens success. They have arranged to
have ft large te:it pitched on the lawn,
where there will hi found a shooting
gallery, kinetoscope and animatoscope.
In ihe house t>ere are to be various
booths, including an Oriental booth,
American Indian booth and bazaar, re
lreshment booth and an art treasure
room.
In the art treasure-room will be found a
bewildering collection of antique fans,
costly Â»aces, rare porcelain and magnifi
cent o!a mahogany. All the curiosity
owners in the City seem to have loaned
their treasures for this booth, and the re
sult will doubtless be beautiful and in
structive.
But what the ladies consider the feature
of the exhibit is Toby Rosenthal's latest

not ifiÂ°d of the fact and he sent for Attor
ney GaLagber. What passed between
them is nut known, out Gillagher offered
his services to the police in assisting them
to find Harris.
The robbery of Morshead .A Son's safe
occurred Friday afternoon :n:d with the
proceeds Harris got drunk. Friday night
about 9 o'clock Attorney Gallagher ana
Polic man Cavanaugh saw him reeling
alone Kearny street und he was promptly
arrested on the bench warrant. He ap
peared before Acting Judge Kerrigan yes
terday morning and the c^se was con
tinued tili Tuesday.
The Harbor police station notified the
other stations, givine a description of the
man that robbed Morshead's safe, and
that he had a black eye. Yesterday morn
ing the California-street station notified
the Harbor station that Harris Â«niw;ere<l
the description and had a black eye.
Detectives Egan and Silvey ariil Police
man Eiis, who were workinc on the safe
robbery, took J. W. Morshead to the City
Prison yesterday, and he identified Harris
as the man who entered hi* office Friday
afternoon a few minutes before the rob
bery, and asked for a pencil and a piece ol
paper to write a note. It is supposed that
while Morshead went across the street for
a few minutes Harris sneaked back and
robbed the safe.
He was also identified by Ben Levi, a
Clay-street merchant, as a man who en
tered his office Friday afternoon and
asked for a pencil and paper to write a
note, but was refused. Young Levi after
ward saw him in the office of the J. F.
Cunningham Company, next door to
Morshead'a, where he was successful in
borrowing a pencil and paper. â 
The detectives think Harris is the man
that robbed the ticket office of the creek
route at the ferry depot, and the office of
the Sausalito ferry two or three weeks
aj:o, as he fully answers the description.
Every effort is being made by the Dolice
to find Harris' room, as they expect to
discover the proceeds of other burg'aries
on the water front.

A CABLE ROAD HIGH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS
An Effective and Practical Line Operated in the Usual Manner and Used for
Hauling Logs From Their Hidden Glades to the Railroad
In the heart of a dense forest, and miles
away from any town, one would scarcely
expect' to find cable roads in operation.
A PEOPLE'S PRESIDENT
. The stranger who visits Washington i
these days will enjoy the unique sensa- I
tion of seeing a President, who has not for
gotten that he is still a citizen. President
McKinley has apparently been altogether
unaffected in his ideas by his elevation to
the high clnoe he holds. The pomp of j
power is only slightly in evidence. The |
array of bluecoats that have encircled the |
Whita House grounds in greater or less
degree for four years is to be greatly >
diminished. In addition, the grounds of !
â¢ the executive mansion on the south side I
are to be. again open to the public A Re- j
publican in politics, President McKinley â 
every day proves himself exceedingly
democratic in his ideas.
All during the Cleveland administra- i
tion the attaches of the Government j
seemed to vie with one another in their J
efforts to add to the exclusiveness with j
whicii Mr. Cleveland sought to surround j
himself. The radical . chanse from at- j
tempts of this nature to utter absence j
of anything like exclusiveness is
â what startle 3 the old-timer here and
pleasÂ« 3 the visitor immensely. If one
wishes to see the President now on a le
gitimate errand he is permitted to talk to
him, and that without any unnecessary
delay. The President wiil not permit
any one to wa-te his time, but he under
stands thoroughly how to be courteous
and at the same time cause his visitor to
see for himself that his call is brief. This
Yet this and many other surprises will
greet the stranger in the great "redwood
belt" of Californiaâ those forests of giant
is the secret of popularity. No one is
neglected, none are snubbed ; every one is
treated with a politeness that is exceed
ingly erateful, thou-'h no attempt is made
to impress the recipient with the Presi
dent's courtesy.
President McKinley sees no reason why
he should be debarred from the privileges
which citizenship and good conduct confer
upon any man. It has almost become a
popular maxim that the sidewalks of
Washington are not good enough for the
President of the United States to walk
upon. This is the result of a rigid adher
ence to etiquette and a liberal use of the
carriage* which are supposed to convey
the chief executive about the city when
he cares to go. The present occupant of
the Presidency is no lover of livery. A
man whose personal habits are above re
proach, he is still one of tho>e rare humans
that men know as a thoroughly good fel
low. He dearly love-t 10 take a walk, and
he is likely to go anywhere. He seems to
take a keen delight in traveling about the
city in a most unostentatious fashion, his
companion generally being Secretary Por
ter.
It is almost an every-day occurrence to
see the President, if he happens to be on
the street at the time the children are
passing back ami forth from school, stop
and chat with the youngsters, Seeming to
enjoy the conversation immensely. The
children of Washington have declared Mr.

trees, exceeded in size only by the famous
"Big Trees," another variety of the same
species.
As this timber is peculiar to California
alone, so are the nieihods employed in
getting it out. And nowhere else In the
world are logging operations carried on as
in the redwood forests, which extend along
the coust iron) Monterey almost to the
Oregon boundary line. The Eastern lum
berman will seek in vain for the familiar
methods of his native "pineries," for
tiiose methods are out of date in the "red
woods" ; besides, they are totally inade
quate for handling these giants of the for
est, many of which will measure twelve
or fifteen feet in diameter and nearly 200
feet in height.
Especially in the moving and transpor
tation of the huue logs procured were the
old methods found deficient and danger
ous. Oxen and horses were too slow and
, clumsy, too expensive and in their places
I everywhere are used especially designed
[machines of the cable-windine type, the
application of which is continually being
enlarged. The latest application of this
principle is the cable loeeing road as an
extension of the siearo railroad that trans
ports the logs to the sawmill or storage
pond.
These cable roads are used for bringing
the logs from places in the forest inac
cessible to the locomotive and cars,
usually some gulch, ud which tney wind
and twist to the point where the logs cut
on the surrounding hillsides have been
gathered â in some instances three miles
I from the railroad terminus. Of course
I these roads cannot be compared with the
McKinley to be the be*t President they
ever heard of. As a matter of fact no one
has ever occupied the executive mansion
since the days of Abraham Lincoln who
| seemed to have the gift of attracting; those
' be meets to himself as does McKinley. It
is no exaggeration to say that not more
than a dozen children in Washington can
say that President Cleveland ever spoke
to them. Nowadays, however, the young
sters watch for the President, and they
know the smile and kind word he gives
tdem are genuine and not matters of
policy.
The President also has taken lately to
traveling about by himself. He strolls
alone the street just as he did in the days
when he was a plain Ohio Congressman
and his Presidential aspirations, if they
existed at all, were deep within the bud.
When his acquaintances, of whom he has
hosts, happen to meet him he stops and
chats with them on all sorts of topics,
although us a rule most of them have suf
ficient courtesy to avoid arguments re
garding the offices. The duration of his
walks is limited by the amount of time at
his disposal. Sometimes it is for twenty
minutes and again for an hour.
elaborate street railway system of San
Francisco, for they were not built for
passenger traffic.
In their operation neither cars nor rails
are used, while the truck, if such it may
be called, is only a common "corduroy"
roadway, on tup of which the cable travels,
hauline, or rather "snaking" long trains
of Joes, which slide and bump over its
rough surface.
The power station is located near the
end of the railroad track at some point
convenient for loading the logs on the
cars. Here is stationed a poweriul double,
winding engine, having two drums or reels,
the one capable of carrying at least three
miles of one-inch round steel wire cable
and the other over twice that length of a
considerably lighter cable.
At the beginning of operations the end
of this smaller cable is carried into th<?
woods to the end of the corduroy road,
where it is wove through a fixed block or
sheave and then brought back to the en
gine to be fastened to tne end of tne larger
cable, enabling the latter to be dragged
back into the woods. Thus is the endless
cable formed and the road is ready for
business, the operations at either end or
intermediate points of the ro*ad being di
rected by telephone or other electric sig
nal appliance.
The logs handled on these roads range
from four to twelve feet in diameter, and
from twelve to twenty-four feet in length,
and owing to the sappy nature of the
wood, are exceedingly heavy. Neverthe
less the cable "snakes" them along in
trains of fifteen or twenty at a time at a
speed of three mibs an hour under favora
ble conditions. In making upthese trains,
the logs are placed end to end and securely
fastened ono to the other by means of
short chains attached to "dogs" driven
into the logs.
To the first or lead log a bridle of heavy
chains is rigged for attachinÂ« the hauling
cable, and from this the smaller or "haul
back" cable leads back over the logs, fol
lowing the train out of the woods. A
On one of his walks a few days ago he
was stopped by a shabbily dressed man
who said: "Mr. McKinley, don't you
remember me? I was in your regiment
during the war." The President shook
hands witn the speaker as cordially as if
he had been a member of the Senate, and
with a few kindly words did more to re
move the feeling of depression with which
the shabbily dressed man was evidently
afHicte.l than a |10 note would have ac
complished. Mr. McKinlev is not dis
posed at any time to rebuff any one who
speaks to him except a persistent office
seeker. Toward this class of persons his
manner is a trifle icy and each day is see
ing it congeal to a greater extent.
Perhaps the most unusual thing for a
President to do is the journeying in a
cable-car, which Mr. McKinley enjoy?. It
is true that almost every one knows him,
but his kindly democracy wins him re
spectful treatment by even the most curi
ous, and Washington people at least
refrain from staring at him. This prac
tice on the President's part almost took
away the breath of the class of people who
have looked upon the President as a sort
of demigod, but Mr. McKinley does not
seem to consider himself one whit better
than he was before the election, and ap
parently sees no reason why he should
assume a re^al ma.iner toward thÂ» popu
lace.
In addition to his other travels about
the city the President has become an en
thusiastic equestrian. He selects the
hour between 4 and 5 o'clock for this exer
cise. He has no regular starting point, it
being his evident intention to enjoy a
view of the city from a seat in the saddle
in all the different sections. In order to
save time he is driven from the White
House to a designated point, where he is
met by Major-General Miles and several
attendants with horses. Then the ride
begins. The President and General Miles
are both excellent horsemen. General
Miles has, of course, what is known as the
military seat, and President McKinley
s ; ts his animal with equal grace. The two
canter about and seemingly find any
amount of enjoyment in the exercise.
The President is also inclined to dis
pense as much as possible with the pre
vious fashion of only riding out in a car
riage which is accompanied by liveried
coachman and footmen. He is very fond
of driving a good horse himself and 13
now arranging for the purchase of a road
wagon and a â  stout cob, with which, he
say?, he is going to test the quality of the
Washington boulevards as he never before
had opportunity. It is hinted, too, that
the President has his eye on a very speedy
animal, and though be is a devout Metho
dist and is not supposed to know any
thing about trotting horses, it is confi
dentially whispered that he really Knows
a good piece of horseflesh as well aa the
veriest jockey that rides.
it may seem strange that a man with
so much responsibility on his mind and
with so many calls on his attention
should find time for the exercise and
amusement enjoyed by the President.
President McKinley's success in this re
gard is duo to the fact that he is exceed
ingly systematic. Everything is con
ducted upon a basis of accuracy. There
rude sled, answering the purpose of a
freight-train caboose, carrying iiftine
jack?, pinch-bard and other appliances for
use in case of accident, is coupled to the
rear log and completes the train, which is
then ready to -'pull out/ 1 This fact is
signaled the engineer at the other end of
the route, and soon the long string of
huge logs commences its journey, the
numerous sharp turns in the road causine
it to writhe and twist like some gigantic
snake. *
Grades are of small moment in the con
struction of the road, bui without rails
the principal difficulties nre to keep the
train in the "middle of the road" by
maintaining a "straight pull" on the cable
at all times and, in rountiing curves, to
prevent it from trying to take a short cut
across the chord instead of following the
arc. The first difficulty is overcome by
using bearings and leads for the cable
fixed along the sides of the load wherever
the one or the other is necessary,
horizontal sheaves being used for bearings,
while snatch blocks, from which the cable
can be readily released, give a lead to it.
The remedy for the other difficulty was
very simple, but none the less ingenious.
The usual practice in grading curves was
reversed, the outer edee being made lower
than tne inner edge, thus giving the logs
a tendency to fall away from the curve.
This tendency is increased by fastening
sticks of timber along the inner edge cf
the curve to shear the logs off, any excess
bdng corrected by a proper lead to the
cable.
Releasing the cable from these snatch
blocks, or engaging it with them as occa
sion requires, constitutes the work of the
crew which follows the train out until
arriving at the "landing." Here the
"train" is uncoupled and the crew there
load the logs on the waiting cars by
means of jackscrews, cable purchases,
etc, a car being required for each log.
In the meantime the cable road crew
have loaded the coupling-chains and
bridlo on the sled, and, with the main
cable, are being drawn back into the
woods by the haul-back cable, the main
cable being engaged with the snatch
block- wherever necessary en route.
Such is tne latest application of steam
power in logging operations and, like the
application of the endless cable to street
railway propulsion, a purely Californian
innovation. >*/. H. Gallagher.
is both a time and place for everything.
The system of handling the White House
correspondencs, for instancp, is so per
fect that tue great bulk of the letters re
ceived never bother the President. One
of the clerks of the White House sorts
and opens all mail not marked personal.
Applications for office, indorsements on
applications, and various other communi
cations are sent to the appropriate de
partment without being permitted to take
up the President's time.
All the letters marked personal, with
out exception, are opened by Secretary
Porter. The secretary's relations to the
President are so thoroughly confidential
that he knows what the President cares
to see and what he does not. So by the
time the correspondence is sifted down in
the manner described, it is not as onerous
a matter as mieht be thought. It is rarely
that the President has leisure to read even
a small proportion of the letters that are
marked personal. His secretary furnishes
him with memoranda of the more impor
tant correspondence, which he carefully
scans. It is a notable fact that since Mr.
SacKinley's occupation of the White
House there has been practically no com
plaint of neglected correspondence. The
President is never too bu>y to respond to
the request of a reasonable nature any
more than he is to return the greeting of
an old friend.
Every moraine at half-past 9 o'clock or
thereabouts President McKinley has fin
ished his mail and is ready for the busi
ness of the day. Senators and Repre
sentatives are welcome every day except
Cabinet days, between 10 and 12. Other
persons are met by engagement. Three
atternoons a week the Pres'dent meets
the public in the East room. All the
President's time that he will devote is
taken up by the office-seekers, but to these
he is, as state I, beginning to turn the cold
shoulder. He simply has to do it as a
matter of self- protection.
A dignified, kindly man in his relations
with the public. President McKinley is
pimply devotion itself to his invalid wife.
No matter how great may be the pressure
upon his time, he always finds leisure to
see her a dozen times a day. In the even
ing, if there are no special arrangements,
the President is very likely to engage in
his favorite game of cards, six-handed
euchre, and enjoys himself hugely. It is
often the case, However, that he has to see
a Cabinet Minister or talk with his secre
tary during the evening hours, and this

IN THE LOGGING CAMP.
A smooth, white sheet of ghostly snow
The rough, dark stems defines,
All faintly crossed with row on row
Of shadows from the pines. .
Amidst the dim, tall arches grand
King Silence reigns profound,
And shuns with ni^ht, hand clasped in hand,
The agony of sound.
The lingering moon sinks low and dim,
Its time of labor done,
And nature pauses, cold and grim,
And waits the morning sun.
At last its banners bright appear
Along the eastern sky,
Night shudders, turns with abject fear,
And knows 'tis time to fly.
The smooth, white sheet is crushed and torn
Where soft the shadows lay,
And on the air harsh voices borne
Proclaim the waking day.
King Silence's frosty calm is broke
By steady, ringing blows,
A loud duet of stroke and stroke
That quickens at the close.
Destruction reigns throughout the glade
Where spring the lordly trees,
Long years have cast their somber shade
Or whispered to the breeze,
That caught the sunlight's gilding touch .
Or jewels of the snow,
Have felt the storm fiend's savage clutch
That hurled them to and fro.
Alas ! the storm hath spared in vain,
For man assails his crown ;
And swaying, quivering as in pain,
A king falls crashing down.
The moaning, splintering, deaf'ning sound
Re-echoes far and wide,
Proclaiming with its last rebound
The fall of sylvan pride.
With clanking links the trunk is chained,
And through the flying snow.
With creaking iron cables strained,
The trains of timber go.
And so from dawn to dusky night,
'Mid ring of steel and cheers,
The hand of man with ruthless might
Undoes the work of years.

ODD CYCLING NOVELTY
A new and unique cycling sensation is
the seesaw quadricycle. It is a combina
tion of the old and nearly forgotten tri
cycle with the modern bicycle, and the
result is a curious-looking affair, which is
nbw attracting widespread attention from
wheel men and women throughout the
count ry.
Nothing like it in appearance or design
ever before appeared on the horizon of the
cycling world.
This seesaw quadricycle is essentially a
family affair. It is built for four riders,
with an additional seat for a steersman or
governor. Trie construction of the ma
chine is of the simplest. There are no
complicated joints, gearing or combina
tion of levers and clamps to confute one
or make an ordinary breakdown a seriou3
matter. Also the fact that no previous
experience is necessary in order for one to
ride with all the speed and skill of an es
i crt tends to make the seesaw quadri
cycle a popular means of diversion for
parties of four or even for two persons,
who, while wishing to enjoy the exhilara
tion of cycling, dare not trust themselves
to the uncertain balancing qualities of Lhe
ordinary tandem.
The seesaw quadricycle is a four-wheeled
affair, an its name implie?. The rear set
of wheels are slightly larger in circumfer
ence than tbe forward or Raiding wheels.
Motion h given tbe machine by the weight
of the riders, who sit upon seats differing
very considerably from the ordinary bi
cycle seat.
These seats, of which there are four, two
in front and two in the rear, are fixed at
the ends of lone; levers, which are not un-
like the walking-beam of the ordinary eide
wheel steamboat. The end of each lever .
not occupied by the seats for the riders is
connected by an upright driving-rod with
a large sprocket-wheel in the center of the '
machine.
The tiltine, or seesaw, levers at either
end of the machine are supported over the .
axies by upright supports or standards, â 
strongly braced and working on five roller
bearings.
The seats for the riders at the two ex
treme ends of these levers are comfortably
upholstered affairs, and below them are
adjustable foot rests, which allow riders of
different heights to secure at all times a
comfortable footrest or brace.
The framework of the machine, which
is oblon?, is made of cold drawn seamless
tubing, exactly like that used in tne con
struction of the ordinary bicycle. The
rear wheels are thirty inches in diameter
while the front ones are two inches
smaller.MONSTER SEE-SAW
, Work is being pushed as rapidly as men
and time will- permit upon the greatest
teesaw of which any one ever heard. It is
a mightily enlarged affair that is exactly
similar in principle to the sport almost
every child has enjoyed, which is known
as "teetering." It is Ihe nineteenth cen
.tury evolution of the pine board and the
â  rail fence to the mighty steel columns
'.that subport two huge cars, each of which
.will- accommodate fifty persons.
vT-he" seesaw, as the accompanying illus
trations -show.is composed of a central
lower and ' a bull steel beam. This steel
tower is thirty feet square at the base and
seventy-rive feet high to the upper pin.
On .'this- pin the' beam, which is of steel,
swing? vertically. It is rectangular in
sections is thoroughly braced and 160 feet
long.' It is swung on its axis by means of
twoÂ«teel segments, which are affairs re
. sembling huge crcquet wickets, the ends
cf winch, .fasten into the beam, and the
â¢ roanded center slides 'over a portion of the
towerwhich is. prepared to receive such
"acUoa-. Technically speaking, pinions
. uriven by the operating machine engage
the two segments.
â  To the ends of the big steel beam cars
are 'suspended, one at each en !. Each car
i capable Of holding fifty persons and can
be Lifted alternately to a point 200 feet
above the ground. This is the maximum
heght. The length of the steel beam is
.a^sp 200 feet. The cars used are similar to
3 Hose attached to the Ferris wheel in Chi
cago. As- the illustration given .herewith
shows, when one car is at its . maximum
height the. other rests upon the -earth.
This beam will- move .very slowly, the time
necessary- for the ascent and descent from
the .ground to the maximum height arid
vie* versa being about five minutes. -.'
â  So. slowly will . the oeam move that the
"sense of. motion to the occupants of the
car will., be. almost entirely lost. This is
so arranged in order" that very many per
sons whom a journey into the air of this
.sort w.oiild .'be apt to annoy with nausea
."'liiay r>e. free .from any such internal dis
tUrbYnce. The view to be obtained from
these.-., cars .will be of extraordinary
â  reality. The scents Â©f the battlefield of
Is'tsnville is'viÂ«ible to . the passengers, as
.'is "'The Hermitage," the former home of
Andrew Jackson; Belle Meade, the famous
Block farm of Tennessee, and many other
points of interest.
. The ruachinery that will move the huge
seesaw is located at the bottom of the
steel tower .'and. inclosed in a small house
It is very, simple, for while the tower and
the huge truss beam are monsters of their
sort so -delicate will be the adjustment
that the task.of â¢ the machinery in moving
them will-be comparatively easy. Every
fme â  bo has. ever teetered, and that means
a most ail the persons who will read this
article, understands how necessary it was
tiia: the â b.oar.d used should be nicely bal
anced upon the fence or upon whatever
object v.as its central point of support.
This is the idea which has been oberved
in the c&ns.truction of the ciant seesaw.

The Playing-Cards of All Nations
Altbongh the Puritans bestowed the
name of ''Devil's Picture-Books" upon
playing-cards; they have survived the
execration and will abide a3 a means of
itv>ioc o nt amusement.
Playing-cards have been factors in the
making of history, and some antique re
productions by modern artists bear deli
cacy of design and elaborateness of detail
that ec!ip=es> anything now shown for sale
either in Europe or America.
No definite proof has been established 'o
show in what country playing-cards
originated, bat China tr.um^hantly claims
that honor. Cards, -according to tradition,
were invented in China during the reign
of Leim-ho, in 112U, and were devised for
the amusement of ni-i wive?.
The ordinary Chinese card is long and
narrow and like a finger. The cards are
printed in black on very thin cardboard,
and there are thirty of them in a pack,
segregated into three suits of nine cards
each, and three tingle car i.Â«, which are
named: respectively: Tseen-wan, mean
ing, -"a .thousand times ten thousand";
tieenghwa, "the red flower," and pi hwa,
' 'the while flower." These three cards are
regarded a-s superior in denomination to
ail others.
It is stated by some authorities that
cards are played by the lower class of
Chinese only, and that the aristocratic
native indulges in the play of kew-ma
paoin, or. 'dies- 1 , only, haughtily disclaim
ing, any ..knowledge of pleoeian cards.
.T.Uere is; a conflicting report, however,
th-at cards is a .popular game with all Chi
nese, of hieirand low degree.
â  â  inxTi-a. became a nation of card-players \
at a Very early date, and there are amen â¢ j
some .European curio collections packs of ]
card* of Hindoo antiquity which are I
really forks of art. Some of these are â¢
painted upon ivory, with gilded backs.
They number seven suits, which bear the
adjusted with such mechanical nicety..
Yet C. H. Devallos of Nashville, whose
idea it ir-, says that were it not for that
same delicate adjustment the seesaw
would Le an utter failure. The question
naturally arises is it possible for the steei
beam to slip and thus destroy this bal-
ancs and get beyond the control of the
machinery ? Tiie inventor says, however,
that owing to the tremendous prehensile
strength of the structure, especially at the
points where any strain may possibly de
velop, an accident of the sort suggested is
absolutely impossible.
At the time of the World's Columbian
Exposition in Chicago, or rather some
months previous thereto, an idea some
thing like that which has resulted in the
construction of the seesnw was broached.
The builders and mechanical experts who
were asked to jass upon the idea laughed
at the phn and *aiu that even in this era
of wonderful creations, the successful car
rying out of such a project was entirely
out of the question. It simply coui<l not
be done. Mr. Devallos ha?, however,
shown that the seeming impo.-sible is
clearly practicable, and his seesaw prom
ises to be one of the greate-c, if not the
greatest, attraction at the Tennessee cen
tennial.
The contractors promise to have the
seesaw finished early in May, for the ex
position opens May land continues until
the Ist of November. From present indi
cations their task will sureiy bs completed,
and it i 3 i:keiy by the time this reaches
, the p&bJic the first trial will have takÂ«n
place. There is no reason to doubt that
â  the seesaw will be an entire success Mod
'â  els- which are exact duplicates in detail of
the towering structure have worked per
fectly. Ail sorts of experiments have
been triei with them ior the purpose of
: meeting in advance any difficulties which
j would De likely to assail the combination
that stands on Vanity Fair in the exposi-
I tion grounds.
The only seeming impediment to the
entire success and great popularity of the
, s?esaw seems to ba that on the face of it
: it is what the Tennessee mountaineer calU
i "scary." When one stands on the ground
I and looks up at the top of the tower and
: remembers that the swing of the great
. truss-beam would take him 20) feet from
the earth, with nothing but air between
him and terra firma, he is apt to hesitate.
! Tuere really will be no danger, but the
I trouble is it is irkely to seem as if there
< were, and to most people that is as bad as
if what was feared reaily existed.
If the career of the seesaw at the Ten
i uessee Exposition is a success, it will mean
â  a new era in amusement enterprises, for
there is no reason why these mechanical
teeters cannot be constructed on a much
i smaller scale. There are a great many
i peop.e who possess so many years tbat
they cannot bring themselves to confess
that there stili clines to them that innate
iove of teetering which, when children,
they were able to gratify. If the set -saw
makes its appearance in the great cities,

There is a pack of Hindustani cards
preserved in tbe museum of ttie Royai
Asiatic Society. The cards are circular
in shape, the diameter of the largest
measuring two and three-quarter inches
and of the smallest two and an eighth
inches. Tbe memorandum aceompauying
these card* states them to be made of
canvas, but the materia" has rather the
aDpearance of veneered wood a3 thin as a
wafer.
One of these packs belonged to Captain
D. Cromliiie Fmith, to whom they were
pre-eiued in lÂ«lo uy a distinguished Brah
min, who believe! them to be ten centur
ies oid, and therefore a great and curious
treasure.
A pack of cards purchased by Locfcwood
de Forest in Cashmere within recent
years bear a close resmblauce to those
now in the possession of the Asiatic
Museum. Their appearance indicates
tuat they were hewn from thin layers of
wood, but thpir original material is con
ceaied. under a thick coat of paint and
veneer. The pack contains thirty-six
cards, of three separate suit". A large
purple flower on a red ground, traced
within a disk of orange, embellishes the
backs of the cards, and, although the de
signs harmonize, they are so irregular
that an apt player could readily uistin
guisu one !rom another.
The backgrounds are brilliantly painted.
E ;ch suit is uniform in color and design.
Upon the "i ip" cards are represented
any figures of men wearing loose red gar
ments and cardinal turbans. They are
grouped a:id face each other in kneeling
attitudes, as if in prayer. Another suit is
identified by a dark blue background, on
whicn are painted small yellow disks, sur
rounded by circles of red. This design is
similar to the money emblem as shown
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, M/VY 2, 1897,
PRINCE OF SLISSINGHAM TERRACE.
Everybody knew everybody else at Mrs.
! Siiasineham's boarding-house; it was a
| terrace, and terraces are great for tbat
sort of knowledge. When ona Bpoke in
I any of the rooms the occupants of the
! neighboring rooms would know that he
j spoke, and whoa he turned over in his
j bed they Heard him. The beds at Mrs.
I Slissingham's were folding-beds, so even 1 .
j body knew wnen everybody went to bed â
, likewise when everybody got up, and also,
i through his transom, could tell to a rutu
i ute how late his gas burned.
We were representatives from almost
; every State at Mrs. Slissingbam'*; ihe
! most of us had come to the high altitude
j and dry atmosphere of Denver for our
| health, and Mr?. Siissinghani's was not
i expensive. One day there came to the
! terrace a new boarder. He was of middle
| age, a fine, strong face, sympathetic, blue
! eyes, and such soft, clingy, curly, brown
hair; onfeof the lady boarders was heard
to say that she would give a nickel to slip
her fingers through it. His bearing was
j so courtly, and withal so kindlyâ when
I their notice was forced upon himâ that
some of the boarders christened him "Toe
Prince." He wore a decent though rather
old suit, a so.t slouch bat, ate his meals
regularly, and as regularly came and
wentâ somewhere; and that was all we
couid find out about him, notwithstand
ing one sympathizing lady, whose room
j was above his, lost no opportunity of look
i ing through the transom as she went up
or came down the stairs.
The days came and went; the beautiful,
golden fall passed by, and still the Prince
I came and went his way. His step iost
: some of its buoyancy, his face some of its
hopefulness. The snow began to fall and
< th- white winter was upon us. The seams
: in the Prince's coat grew shiny, and he
, did not get him an overcoat. The Prince-;
i trousers began to look a suspicion shabby ;
â  his shoes leaked on warm days when the
-now melted, and he did not buy him a
; pair of rubbers. He was considereJ cc
i centric. Some thought him miserly;
others that he had come from a much
cuhlef ciimate. A change came gradually
i upon the Prince. The sadne-s grew in
; his fac=. The tinge of gray become a de
' cided whiteness. The chambermaid con
: fidentiatiy told each lady boarder that he
; hadn't a thing in his room except an old
i Bible, a violin case and a little tin box.

j was littered with drawings ana curious
' maps of mountain ranges wiih holes in
i the sides; that all his papers were some
| thing about mines; that he spent hours in

; averred that they were "beaatifuller"

GREATEST SUBMARINE TUNNEL, EVER PROPOSED
The British Government now has under
consideration a plan for the greatest sub
marine tunnel which trie mind of men
ever conceived. It propel 83 for a pas-
B&gewfty, to be lighted by electricity, be
neath the Irish Sea or North Channel, as
it is called, from a point in Scotland just I
north of Point Patrick to a point in Ire
land just west of Larnckfergus and sev
eral miles north of the arm of the sea
stretching up to Belfast which is known
as Belfast Lake. Tne total estimated cost
is $35,000,000, and the plan which the Gov
ernment is considering is that submitted
by a syndicate which agrees to bind itself
to bring the project to successful accom
plishment.
Englishmen are supposed to be exceed
ingly wary of anything that savors of the
illoeical, but the ideas of the syndicate
which proposes to build this tunnel are
anything but chimerical. It is argued
1 that the traffic which would surely seize
upon this avenue of commerce between
thf i-lands that constitute Great Britain
would cc more than sufficient to pay a
handsome rate of interest upon the in
vestmentânot less than 6 per cent. This
wou'.d require a net profit of $2,100,000 a
year, and when one considers those fig
ures, in comparison with the returns from
tne freight and passenger traffic between
England and Ireland, it is easy to see
where the syndicate finds basis for its be
liet. It is also stated that the syndicate
has asked for a Government guarantee or
I subsidy, but this statement has not been
! verified.
This is not the first suggestion of a sub
aqueous connection between t!:e divided
portions of Britain. The previous plan
contemplated a tunnel beneath what is
called St. George'- Channel, this being the
southern entrance to the Irish Sea. The

another suit with a "moon" mark, a
Hindustani emblem, which has also

A recent traveler and archaeologist
brought from Persia six tablets which add
an interesting souvenir to the cards of
different nations. The cards are described
as "layers cf pasteboard, some as thick as
two ordinary playing cards and some
almost doubie that thickness."
They are an inch and an eighth wi<le by
two inches long and bear marks wbich in
dicate them to be of different packs. They
are thickly coated with paint and enamel
ami the backs are uniformly painted
b act. They are remarKable chiefly on
account of the queen, or courtesan, repre
sented on the court card, a figure that
makes them differ not only from all other
Eastern cards but from those of every
Western nation also, excepting France.
Seated in a chair of state this female fig
ure is pictured as holding a young child

Ihereare two aueen9 in this pack of
cards ; one on a red, the other on a yelloT
background. These cards all have ex
quisitely ornamented corners, and the
figures on them are delicately executed,
showing in their delineations the touch
of un artist.
Various games of instructive cards were
used by the younger Puritans, and one
quaint pact of "educational cards," wnich
are supposed to have originated in Xew
York, it still preserved by Dr. Rich
ard Derby in his ancient family mansion
on Lloyds Neck, Long Island. These
cards are bound togemer with a crumpled
grefn ribbon, and on the back of the
Â£nayÂ« of diamonds is written : "To An

uncle, Henry Lloyd."

comfortless, but it overlooked the city.
There was no register in this top roomâ it
had not been designed by the architect for
a bedroom.
Soon, after his removal to the "sky par
l lor," as the boarders called it, it was no
j ticed that he came only to breakfast. The
i young girl who sat at the table where he
I ate waited upon one and another pretense
jofdaliyine until the dining-room doors
were closing. The P.-inca had spoken
I kindly to her once when she was unhappy,
, he had be?n courteously polite to her at
I the table, ami that was all. She was a
j gentle little creature with a limid manner
; and a face like a new wild rose, the kind
!of half-scared face behind which the
i bravest bravery is often hiclde"h. She
| watched for t;;e Prince from a sheltered cor
j ncr which had the door in view. He came
in wearily; she saw him ascend the first
I flight of stairs, and heard him the second
; and the third. She went to her room and
i wept.
A strange thing happened that ni ht.
The boarders all came out in the hall to
listen. Down trom the "sky parlor" came
softly, falteringly at first, then with a
mighty strength of rhythmic power a wave
of sweet m-'lody. It rolled into every re
mote corner of Slissingharn Terrace; the
Prince was playing h.s violin. He was
playing "Home, Sweet Home," played it
over and over and over again, played it
as none there had ever heard it before.
The next day the girl with the wild-rose
face dallied at the table again. She aie
little, and when she could wait no lon er
toolc the daintiest parts of herdinner, that
which she had not touched, rolled them
in her napkin, and carried them surrepti
tiously away.
That night again the Prince went heav
ily, wearily up t be stairs â it was always
dark now when he came in. T. 112 young
Kirl watched him with teary eyes. -That
night again the music of "Home, Sweet
Home flooded the terrace ai:d the people
stood in tne hail and doorways and lis
tened. When the Prince lilted his pillow
to turn Mown the covÂ«Â»r there was a dain
tily folded napkin under it. He picked it
up to remove it, then dropped it in its
place and looked at it. A flush spread
over his face ami a mist before his eyes;
but he knelt beside the bed and on h;s
Knees at?.
Ihe next night and the next it was that
: way and for a week the same. The people
left thesr doors ajar tbat tuev might hear
lat its b?st the Prince's "Home, Sweet
I Home." He never played anything else,
j and when it would cease the air would
I swish with sig is. The young girl prayed
i every n'gbt for th 9 Prince; every night
! the Prince, on his knees by his bed, ate
i the bit of luncheoa that was under his
I pillow.
One grumpy man was heard to say he
! "was tired or that 'Home, Sweet Home*
project was carefully considered, f jt the
insatiable commercial eye of this country
overlooks tHftning. Marine engineers who
were questioned concerning the matter
were emphatic in their statemens that
any such idea was impracticable because
of the exceptionally stormy nature ant
powerful currents of St. George's Channel.
For this reason the first suggestion has
been held in abeyance until the fate of
tie second on>* th ill be decided. It may
now, nowever, be" said to be practically
dead, aa the plan which the Government
is considering seems entirely feasible.
Tne quickest way to get from England
to Ireland at the present time is from
Holyhead to Dublin, a distance of sixty
four miles. The direct route by rah from
London to Liverpool is 138 miles. From
Cork, which is prsctically Queen -town, to
Liverpool it is 283 miles. Ou a basts of
miles the land and tunnel route according
to the proposed nlan would be somewhat
longer than the more direct water route of
to-day. Considering the fact that no
storms would be met with md that stress
of weather would at no time intertere with
traffic, this apparent drawback disappears.
Not only thar, but it is far easier to ship
goods by rail than by water. The saving
of time in loading and unloading is tre
mendous. Again, there could be a regu
larity in the transhipment of freight, no
matter what the amount might be, which
business," and he went in and shot his
door, but he listened.
It was a Friday morning when two let
ters came for the Prince. Ona was an
ordinary letter, and the other was large
and had a legal look. Anybody who
chanced to be in the hall took the letters
from the postman at Slissingham's. The
pretty, yonng girl carried the Prince's
letters up to the sKy parlor. She looked
quickly about, kissed the letters and
slipped them under the door. The Prince
climbed the stairs that Friday night more
wearily and heavily iha:i ne had done be
fore. He was decidedly shabby now,
notwithstanding his carefully brushed
clothes; his hair, for want of barbering,
curled in mutinous freedom to his neck.
There was a long silence â a half hour
passed, another and another. Thegrumpy
man said, -'We'll not have that 'Home,
Sweet Home' business to-night," and he
shut his door with n bang. He wanted to
hear it, he knew he did, but he liked -iot
to see the ladies listen so absorbedly to
another man.
The young girl was listening; her room
was directly under the Prince's. Sne was
happy; she was sure that legal envelope
had brought the Prince a fortuneâ sue
knew he was reading the letters. She
heard the PrincJ tuning his violin, and
the strain of listening loosed its tenseness
in a sigh.
Never had the PrincÂ« plnyed as he
played that ni,-ht. Those who heard it
will remember that music until they aie.
It was the lost chord in the soul of music,
it was a living sound. Tte terrace vi
brated with it, the shadows trembied on
the walis. The people crept out into the
halls and huddled together and bowed
their heads. The floodgate of harmony
was suddenly slipped wide, and all the
heartacues of all the world tliat had gone
up 10 heaven in prayer issued forth from
that one sweet, wild wai! of "Home,
Sweet Home," A si.ring snapped; they
heard it, those peoule that listened below.
The silence that followed hart their ears.
They stole away to their rooms without
looking at each other.
When the chambermaid went to the
Prince's room it was late â she never got
to tbat room early â the lamp still burned.
She turned it down quickly. The Prince
lay on the bed asleep; he uad his clothes
on, his ught arm was crooked over his
eyes. The littie roil of luncheon was
under his piilow, the violin with its
broken string on the cnair. She tip-toed
across the room and looked at him, and
t: en flei shrieking down the stairs.
The Coroner's jury opened the little tin
box and read the few letters that it con
tained. Thpy were several months old
and were monthly requests for money or
w-re reproaches. The two letters that
came on the Friday morning were laid on
top of them. The ordinary one was signed
is not at present enjoyed and never can
ba by a water route.
The members of the syndicate who are
willing to discuss the matter say they
have reason to believe tne passenger traf
fic would be a very considerable item in
the profits. With reasonable railroad
fares and an all-land passage, it is de
clared the travel between England and
Ireland would be at lea^t fifty per cent
greater than it is at present. The Irish
Sea is at no time a gentle body of water
and one is almost as certain of a violent
attack of seasickness as when crossing
from Dover to Calais. The railroad lines
of England and Scotland run direct to
Point Patrick, or at least some of them do;
therefore the only railroad building that
would be necessary would be the exten
sion of such lines as do not at present
reach the terminus of the proposed tun
nel. Passengers from London would of
necessity have to traverse almost the en
tire length of England and ride over a bit
of the southeastern portion of Scotland,
but that is not such a long journey.
Emerging from the tunnel in Ireland, a |
! short distance north and east of Car
i rickfereus, to which town they would pro- !
ceed by rail, passengers could journey

church. They opened tne legal document
last. It was a notice served upon him of
an application for divorce on the ground
of "failure to provide." In the inside
pocket of his coat they found a photo
graph of a family.
When they had all gone away and the
Prince in his ragged glory lay straight
ene 1 upon his bed the young girl, whose
face had been like a new wild r< se. came
into the room. Her eyes were swollen and
red. She came timtdiy to the side of the
bed and looked down upon the Prince's
face. She slid down on her knees and hid
her face on the bed, then arose calmly and
went awny.
A woman puu-ed before the entrance to
Slissingharn terrace and looked at the
number. She wjr<? a long black cloak and
hat with rich, drooping plumes. A statu
esque shaaow in black she looked, but her
face was Â£is pale as the new-fallen snow,
and it shone through the meshes of her
thick, black veil a saintly beauty. She
aslce.t to see the man who had been found
dead that morning in his room. When
they showed her to the door and would
have entered with her she said: "I would
be alone with him," and she closed the
railroads that gridi-on the Emerald I-iie
would carry them. Such a tunnel would
undoubtedly give a tremendous impetus
to railroad building in Ireland, conserva
tive business men say, and t.iis wouid
mean the intusion of a commercial spirit
which is at present sadly lacking. Inas
much a3 close commercial ties generally
become sinews of frienc'shtÂ«R the advocates
of the tunnel declare that their plan is
well worthy of patrio:ic support as a pos
sible key to the solution of the Irish
problem.
The statement made in the beginning
of this article that the tunnel is the larg
est conception of the sort in the history
<*f thfi world n shown beyond perad
venture by comparison with the great
tunnels complet'd or in prospect. The
tunnel between Djver and Calais, or
England and France, would be no more
of an undertaking, so far as the building
of the tunnel is concerned, than has been
accomplished half a dozen times. Be
sides that the Diver-Calais tunnel is in
stataquo. In 1881 some 2000 feet of ex-
perimental borings were made through
the chalk and marl, beginning at Folke
stone, Dut that is about all that has been
accomplished.
We have our tunnels under the Mersey,
the Severn and the Thames, the second
being the greatest of the three, but the
building thereof was as child's play comp
door and locked it. Long she stood beside
the Prince and gazed down on the silent,
straightened form. The sorrow of her
eyes was sadder than tears. She took
Ironi her cloak a white rose â it was warm
from lying on her bosomâ and laid it on
his breast.
"I would have divided my last cent
with you if 1 had only known. I wouM
have given my life to save yours."
The photograph of the family lay on the
table. She picked it up and looked at it
a moment â a strange, unreadable expres
sion flitted over her face. She stooped
and slipped the photograph under ilia
Prince's vest nenrest the heart that could
never again throb a response to its touch.
A tear fe:l on the white rose. She bent
lower, her beautiful mouth touched the
Prince's ear; her lips moved in a whisper.
Sue lifted a lock of his silfcen, curly hair
from his temple and kissed it.
When the tirst newspaper reporter came
!o taue an exact copy of the contents of
the little tiu box the white rose iay on thu
dead man's broast, the photograph lay
against his heart, the violin wnh iti
broken string was on the chairâ but the
box and its contents were gone.
And the Coroner and his jury were mer
cifully silenc. Madge Morris
ared to this. These tunnels and the
one in the United States between Port
Sarnia and Port Huron and under the
Detroit River, omprise all the sub
aqueous under.akings of this sort of any
note. Of course, there are the Mont Cenis,
St. Gothard and other tunnels, which are
I both under ana over ground, but the diffi
culties in their construction were hardly
of the sort to be compared with tho.-e
which confront the builders of the pro
posed tunnel between Scotland and Ire
land.
With only the methods of a quarter of a
century ago to depend upon, the construc
tion of so great a tunnel beneath a vast
body of water would have been simply im
possible. Modern genius, however, has
rendered the performance of a seeming
miracle not only possible but compara
tively easy.
The Tallest Railroad.
The Peruvian (Jeniral Transandine,
or Oroya Railroad begins six feet above
tide-water at Callao. From Lima,
*"ight miles ahead and 500 feet higher,
it winds up the narrowing valley
of the Rimac, past ereat haciendas and
forgotten ruins. At Chosica, thirty-three
miles from tbe sea, it has gained but 2800
ieet in elevation; but within the yard
limits of that station begins the 4-per
cent grade, which is steadily maintained
lor seventy-three miles. The ilimac's gorge
becomes deeper and more contracted, the
little boys nnd benches of cultivable
land rarer. At the hamlet of Sau Bar
tolome serious engineering begins. The
overhanging hillside on the right displays
the first "V,"' the characteristic device
so frequently necessary to overcome
the headlong valley. The maximum
gradient (allowed by contract) of 211 feet
to the mile has in many places been
stretched and the a;tual gradient is some
times nearer 5 per cent. But even this was
insufficient to meet the exigencies of the
quebrada, whose floor often greatly excels
that slope. The only way to get ahead
wa3 to run back a few furlongs or miies at
full grade, and then to shoot forward on
the upper arm of tha zigz ig. S une of
these 'â¢V's" run back and torth like slop
ing shelves in the high wails of the main
gorge; some double and twist iar up
lateral valleys. Not to confine the matter
to single points, where the ro;id has to
give five miles to gain one, the total per
centage is astonishing. From Callao to
Koya lhe length of t!i9 track is 231^ kilo
meters: of these 7tPÂ£(one mile m every
three) are consumed in overcoming the
rise â and this beside the unprecedented
maintaining of such a maximum grade.
Four miles above San Bartolome and its
tropic side valley is the great bridge of
the Aqua de Verrucas, or water of warts.
This noble cantilever, built in New Jer
sey, hr>s a length of 520 /eel and a height
of 260. The old bridge was, in its day,
the highest in existence â and was
meant to be. To that end the center pier
was sunk in a twelve-foot pit. Thi3 pier
was washed out by a cloudburst in 1889,
and for a year trallio was maintained by a
cage swinging on cables across the gap.
The present structure has been left far
behind as to height by tiie bridge over the
river Loa, on the ti6o-in<le Antoiagasta
line in Chile â ttie longest of narrow
eauge railroads, and, with its thirty-inch
track, the tipsiest. The Aqua de Ver
rugas is not to be laughed down as a su
perstition. Of the grim reality in these
poisonous spring?, which fill the unwe&ry
drinker with frightful goitre?, one may
see visible prcofs of plenty. The building
of the Verrucas bridge cost a frribie
mortality, and the cemetery of Bellavista
is full of its victims. This strange and
frequently fatal ''disease of the warts,"
which haunts many corners of the Cordil
lera, seems to have relation to certain
mineral strata. It is aiike unknown in
this part of Peru below 6000 and abor*
9000 feet.â Harper's Weekly.

FASHION'S FADS AND FANCIES
As though to verify my remarks made
last week concerning the exquisite taste
of American women, I lind that the gowns
to which were awarded the principal
prizes a: the second annual doll show in
New York were of pale green, black, white,
pink and gray. All the models were con
tributed by the leading dressmakers in
' this country.
Mrs. Whitney's prize of $100 for the ball
gown considered nicst perfect, was
awarded to a New York designer. It was
in black and white, the honorable men
tion having been bestowed upon a deli
cate green frock.
Mrs. Herman Oelrichs offered a like
sum for the most successful garden party
dress. It was won by a bright woman
who resides in St. Paul, Minn.
Generally speaking, all the visiting and
street costumes were subdued in color,
the principal prize having been received
by tho exhibitor of a street gown corn-

posed of black whipcord worn with a
wi:ite vest.
Eo great was the success of Vogue's sec
ond doil show that it promises to become
an annual event, and as every cent re
ceived is donated to an excellent charity
in every way, it is deserving of the dis
tinguished patronage lavished upon it.

Most of us realize in looking over fash
ion-plates how few, comparatively, can b>
used exactly as they are depicted. We
take ttie iitea of a jacket from one, of a
vest from another, and a third gives us ex
actly the skirt we most admire, so that
frequently the description of the trim
min? of an elaborate oall gown will fur
nish j ist the necessary hint for the ar
ran rement of lace on the simplest, pret
tiest lit tie organdy imaginable; or again,
the colors of costly lace over richest satin
conveys a delightful idea for a dainty
evening waist to be evolved out of the
most inexpenÂ«ive of fabrics.
Gowns Recently Worn
BY WELL-KNOWN WOMEN.
A drsss worn this month by Mrs. Harry
Payne Whitney emanates from the abode
of a well-known New York dressmaker.
It is of a dark blue and white checked
woolen goods, the Dlazer jacket being
] rather long, open in front and a snui fit
I in the back, but the sides are loose and all
i tl}e senms rather heavily strapped with
; dark blue cloth. Two good-sized pockets
j are on the hips. The broad lapels and
collar are of the finest white broadcloth
I beautifully embroidered with fine gold
{thread. One of the waists Mrs. Whitney
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 2, 1897.
WIDE STRINGS IN VOGUE.
Wide strings are a fad just now. This fine Panama straw hat is coquettishly bent and
is worn quite far back oa the head. The trimming Is a bow of wired lace and bunches of
carnations. The strings are of cerise taffeta.
will wear with this blazer is of creamy
white dimity covered with artistic little
yellow figures. The collar is a soft crush
one.
The Countess of Essex possesses this
spring a handsome mignonette grenadine,
through which runs a little green satin
stripe, it is made over soft finished jireen
9i!k; now carefully note the fact that the
most exquisitely and correctly garbed of
women will not tolerate the rustling sound
of taffeta any more than the rustle of a
stiffly starched white skirt. But I know if
you ask at most stores for a silk with a soft
finish, and state that you wish it for a
lining, you will be informed that taffeta is
the thing.
Well, to return to the Countess' frock,
the bodice has a smart vest of pale green
silt daintily embroidered, her straw hat
matches this in tone, and it Is merely
adorned with black ostrich plumes.
At an afternoon whist party given a few
weeks ago in Paris, Mrs. Ayer looked ex
tremely well in a black satin confection.
Of lime. Fa ure's frock, which was worn
Dy her at the Elysee ball, a Vogue corre
spondent writes: "She wore a gown of
pale azure brocade, the train en rnanteau
de cour falling from the shoulders, where
it was attached by clasps of magnificent
brilliant?. Venetian point of great value
fell in rich showers on the front of the
skirt and encircled the decolletaga." In
her hair was a '^ng and slender osprey of
A DAINTY CREATION.
Black grenadine evening dress with gathered and tucked long sleeves. The frill which
frames the square low-cut neck is formed of many tuckefl ruffl 's. A bunch of roses on the
bieast matches the rose-pink velvet waistband. The pearl necklace with in dependent
chaius gives the finishing touch to this exquisite toilette.
white heron leathers tliat started from a
pompon of marabout tip constellated
with diamonds.
On this occasion the young daughter of
the President is said to have reminded all
present of an exquisite paste! by Latour,
her long-trained dress of miroir moire
silk being shot with pale rose, pale green
ana the most delicate shades of pearl. The
corsage was covered with pink silk muslin
and trimmed with pink velvet and fresh
Bengal roses. A haif moon of these roses
was must becomingly arranged on the
left side of her bead.
At this same ball several simply superb
creations of white satin formed the foun
dation, over which were draped the rarest
and most exquisite of laces and gauzes
that were covered with diamonds, in
many cases used alone, but in others in
combination with jewels and jets.
On another festive occasion a leader of
fashion was gowned in a vert d'eau bro
cade; the long skirt had a quillo in front
and one on each side of green velvet of I
a much deeper tone, covered with ara- !
besque designs embroidered in silk beads
and gold, silver and stesl spangles. Bre
telles of sable were on the low bodice;
the same fur also encircled the shoulders.
In one earner nestled a bunch of violets;
indeed, these lovely flowers aro never out
of fashion. The slippers worn were of
dark-creen satin, embroidered at the tips.
The stockings were mauve.
Continuing, this correspondent states
tuat a fair Countess wore pint moire, be
comingly fashioned, the skirt opened on
the side over a panel of soft pink gauze
plisse which simulated an underskirt, and
was bordered with two rows of gold em
broidery which sparkled with jewels. At
the left side the bodice had a drapery of
pink gauze and on tie right one of gold
iace richly jeweled. The short sleeves
were puffs of gauze held in at intervals
with pink ribbons. Pink feathers com
posed the fan, and the necklace and tiira
were of pearls. The pink satin shoe?,
spangled with gold, were worn with pink
silk stockings having insertions of Valen
ciennes lace. The long pinkish white
gloves taa bracelet fastenings. With
this toilet was worn a sort cloak and
pelerine of bright pink Ottoman having
an edging of chine white silk and quite an
amount of whits cneuille embroidery and
shadtd ponies. In front were tulle quille3
wrought with gold and surrounded with
white feathers. Pink gauze formed a
double ruche around the neck. It was
plisse and fell on either side of the quilles.
Spring Fancies.
The bolero coat has reaily become ex
tremely fashionable. It may be that this
popularity will prove its death, but just at
present it promises to be worn as generally
as tde E;on jacket was in its palmiest
days. Everywhere it is in evidence, made
in the cheapest as well as the mo&t costly
materials. While it is not strictly new as
an article of wear, it is quite so as a fash
ion, which, as I have said, amounts at the
present lime almost to a croze. It is, in
lftct, one of the curiosities of clothes be
cause it is something exceedingly trying
io any but the neatest and daintiest of fig
ures.
For the woman who wants to wear what
is called a smart coat, there is one just be
ginning to be worn of the Chesterfield
shape, that is exceedingly comfortable and
stylish at the same time. The skirts are
not lined, so that while warm they are not
heavy. Tiie top portion does not fit
tightly, for it just follows the lines of the
figure.
The seams are all strapped and that
around the waist is not straight, but
curved upward over the hips and pointed
downward under two buttons at the back
and ngain toward the pockets in iron;.
This is a clever device to give due appear
ance of length and slenderness to the
figure.
The skirts are wide and there is thns
plenty of room for the dress beneath. The
collar is strapped and faced wiih velvet,
and ihe cuffs are gauntlet shape and
piped with velvet. The garment can be
either single or double breasted, the for
mer being perhaps newer and smarter.
The bouy portion is lined with very hne
woolen kersey.
Among the new spring mantles is a
mantelet in black moire miroir with a
pattern of siJk gr nadine applique and
edged with sequins. Large volants form
the sleeves, edged with lace falling over
puffed cream chiffon.
The hat should be of straw with bou
quets of primulas and foliate, as well as
high bows in green and mauve.
A very smart car.c is in black j oult de
foie, the tight-fitting bodice with the fine
guipure embroidery on linen. The
voiants are of kilted black lace and gruss
lawn. The collar is high and made of
pli-se and lace. The jabot is of black
lisse with cream guipure applique.
The hat which accompanies this cape
shoujd be of mauve satin straw, the crown
encircled by rosettes in velvet and satin
moire ribbons in harmonious colors. High
bows and eucalyptus leaves add to its
charm. At the bacar there should be
clusters ot roses in shaded pink.
A very fashionable jacket is the satin
Sultane. It bas a box pleat down the
back and the braces are of fine jet. The
zouave waistband is of folded silk and the
sleeves are with fulled epaulettes. The
appropriate dress for the head with this
jacket is a toque in paie green braid with
sequins and beads. The crown is formed
of mercury richly studdea with beads and
sequins. A handsome osprey feather is
overall.
One of the prettiest gowns of the season
is of casnmer". The ornamentation is an
applique of velvet worked with cord, and
thecoioris the new smoked gray. It is
made of a yoke and a basque cut up in
segments, and the cuffs and the revers are
lined with pink satin, or something cisc,
that is suitable. It is a very smart mid
season gown.
As for the bodice, its popularity seems
to be steadily increasing. Even in the
gauzes and thinner fabrics of which it is
constructed the transparent element,

NEW DICE-PATTERN CHECK.
Black and white is therngeof the hour. In checks the dice pattern is considered the
most attractive. This one in foulard is charming with its bodice full at one side and
draped across the figure. The two friMs are faced with white, covered with cream-colored
lace, with an edging of gold bmid. Betw. en these two frills Is a baud ol turquoise velvet
ribbon. The same ribbon is made into three rosettes and set on the bust ns If gathering up

belt is embroidered with jewels.

pointed toes are after tne style of Edward
111, in patent leather, which, of coursel
have to be filled in as no mortal toe could
ever reach the tips.
These shoes are made with quite mod
erate heels, only one and a half inches
high. Some mule slippers, as they are
called, in yellow brocade bordered with a
ruche, with a heel five inches bign, are
perfect specimens of workruansnip as well
as examples of the height of absurdity
to which a fashionable fad may run.
There is one delightful feature about all
these things of which I have told. We do
not have to wear any of them unless we
wish to. So if any of them are far beyond
the limns to which our purses will permit
us to go we can simply say that for our
part we favor creations less elaborate.
Nobody can deny that simplicity and good
breeding go hand in hand. And there are
times when there is a lot of comfort in the
thought. Marcella.

mentioned in the local account of the dedica

a song in that delightful manner that, has
won for him so much applause. Nat Willis of

MINES
& MINERS
The most notable occurrence in the Califor
nian mining fie.d during the week has been a
s rlke in the deep levels of the old Gwlu mine
In Calaveras County. Every occurrence like
th s aiong the mother lode is a new evidence
of the great truth that has begun to take root
that ttie veins oi that great g Id reelon do not
a 1 pinch out at a depth of a few hundred feet,
but that mother lode mines are apt to be as
rich at great depths a-; near the surface. The
future mining development and gold product
ot the mother lode is largely dependent on
the deep mining of the veins. The Provi
dence, Champion, Kawh.de and Kennedy have
lately langht the mining wor.d that there Is
no known limit to the depth to which high
values extei.d, and a new example like this
one from Calaveras County serves to strengthen
confidence in every mother lo.ie mine and to
stimulate capitalists tr> go deeper and find
riches. As the mmm g world sees mine after
mine that had been abandoned for a genera
tion rewarding with rich ore the enterprise
that will sink below the old workings, confi
dence in the permanent value of the world's
greatest gold field increases, and capital in
search of legitimate investments turn* to Cali
fornia with greater willingness.
But a short time ago the Kennedy surprised
the minmg world by yielding a rich ore body
at a depth of some 2400 feet and now comes
the Given with its rich yield at a depth of
1400, only 200 feet deeper than the level at
wliich operations under the old regime were
suspended more than a generation ago. This
new dcvelODinent follows fast on the division
a few days ago of a dividend of $0000, result
ing from the operations on the new levels.
There is no limit in a generel wny, as far as
man has discovered, to the deuth at which the
mother lode quartz veins continue to pay, and
with the recent realization of this it Is prob
able that in a lew years California will be the
great deep mining gold field of the world.
The Bendigo district, Australia, first demon
strated the deep values of quariz lodes, and
the deep mining operations in that district of
Victoria has had its effect in encouraging
similar operations here. There for many
years, and until comparatively recently, there
existed as did here the belief, fostered by
theorizing geologists, that the deeper the
vein the less gold there was in it. Now there
pre more aeep mines in Victoria than in any
golf! field of the world, and a number of
mines ar- being i rofitably worked at depths
approximating 3000 feet. The deepest paying
mine in me colony is just now the New Chum,
in which a reef 15 feet wide Is being worked
at a depth of 2878 feet, and last year the divi
dends were Â£31,350. The deepsst shaft is
that in the 180 mine, which is down 3310 feet,
at which depth a reef showing gulJ has re
cently been intersected. Scores of otner mines
in the Bendiijo district are paying div.dends
from operations below 2300 feet. These les
sons and the oues being afforded here mean
much to the mother lode.
The hydraulic miners are in a state of anx
ious expectancy as to what the Federal ensi
neers are going to do about spe tiding $500,000
on iarge restraining darns and when they are
going to do It. Tne government engineers
would die before they wou.d say detinitely
where any of the dams wou.d be located and
where they expected to begin building and
there is no newt for the m.ning people be
yond the general information that both the
State and congressional appropriations are
now av.'iiiiiMe, that the dams will be built and
that the three Federal engineers comprising
the California Debris Commission, Colonei
Suter, Mrtjor Davis and Captain Gillette, have,
lti association wHh the S ate Debris Commis
sioner, John F. Kidder. practically decided on
the li citions desired and the plans.
1 heir reticence is proper enough. All sorts
of enterprising people are anxiously nursing
projects so use the water power of the dams,
and an announcement of a dam locition be
fore the land is secured mipht put various
obstacles in the way. Then the plans of the
engineers must bo approved at Washington,
and they will not be made known until after
such approval. The commission Is required
to .-Ã¼bmit a complete detailed plan for the ex
penditure of the entire amount of money pro
vided, and this takes time. Two weeks ago a
cornmittci of tho Miners' Ass' elation hud a
conference with the engineers, but they did
not learn whether the project would reach the
stage i f construction this year or not, or where
any dam will be built. The committee offered
the assistance of the Miners' Association in
securing required land or in o:her matters.
Thednms contemplated by the law are re
gtralninp dams to hold from further descent
the debris now in the river from any cause
and arr> not meant to provide big catch basins
Into which hydraulic miners may proceed to
wash the hllh. In theory each hydraulic
miner must restrain his tailings by dams of
his own as now. Hut as the hydraulic mi ning
operations in the watershed of the Sacramento
are wholiy reeulated by the discretion of the
engineers whose duty is lo prevent new tall
ins from filling up the navigable streams be
low, the existence of large restraining dams

The Kirkham mine at Nevada City is to have
a ten-stamp mill.â Work has been rosumfd on
the Spanish mine, NVvada County. â A 200-foot
Ehaft is being sunk at the Tarantula, in
Tuolumne* County, recently bought dv an
English syndicate.â The quartz being taken
out of the Dead Horse miue, Tuolumne
County, at the 1500 level, is as good as the
mine ever yielded. The shaft is being sunk
200 feet deeper.
The Araador Ledger says that the old Mark
lee mine, near Volcano, Is soi.n to be reopened
b> a Sri Francisco company. This mine was
worked <Jown to a depth of 50i> or 600 feet in
the seventies and ore to the value of about
$1,000,000 extracted. It is believed that
large masses of comparatively rich ore were
left in the various levels as too low grade to
prove attractive at tnat time. A dump of
Bomi- 10,000 tous is estimated to be worm $2
to SJ>3 per ton. and can be milled at a cost not
exceeding 75 cents per ton. â There wer .â¢ 1300

feet will be driven, machinery put in, etc.â
An English syndicate will probably buy the
Lily Emma mine, near Greenwood Creek, El
Dorado County.â A rich strike is reported from
the Blood mine, Calaveras County, which is
another of the mines abandoned years ago
when the vein seemed to pinch out. â In the
district immediately around Jackson. Amador
County, $t>o,ooo a month is paid out as
miners' wages.â The Argonaut mine, Amador
County, is crushing rock going $12 50 to the

It is reported that agents of the London Ex

for permits for hydraulic mining filed with
the Debris Commission are from the Margue
rite Gravel and Eureka Quartz Mining Com
pany, Eureka district, Nevada County, and
from Charles and Benjamin Howlett of Co
lumbia Hill, Nevada County.â The latest Pa
cific Coast town to talk about a smelter is Los
Angeles.
Randsburg is having a 1 ittle reaction from
its suddan boom, and things are moviug
toward a legitimate business basis, on which
the town will steadily grow with the develop
ment of the district. Nearly all the work
being done in the district is in the line of
prospecting and development, and many
promising properties are becoming known.
The entire desert, clear to Death Valley and
southeast to the Needles, is alive wit*i pros

CAVALRY JACK CHAINED,
An Incident of the Monthly
Review at the Presidio
Yesterday Morning.
The Three Branches of the Service
Presented a Fine App'arsnce
en Review
There was an unusual number of per
sons at the Presidio Friday morning,
including a number of ladies, to witness
the monthly review, muster and inspec
tion which is held on the last day of every
month except when such falls on a Sun
day. The presence of so many ladies, who
filled the erand stand, was suggestive of
either the truth of the words of the sons,
"J'aime les Militaires," or the interest in
the army recently revived by the recent
grand military tournament. Be it one or
the other the turning oat of the troops on
the parade grounds of the post is a sight
worth tho seeing, and it ought to be seen
by more of the citizens. By attending the
reviews the citizens get a better idea of
the soldiers, and the soldiers are stimu
lated to higher perfection in the discharge
of their respective duties.
The first to appear on the field yes
terday were the four companies of cavalry,
which took a position on the extreme left,
then came the dismounted artillerymen as
a battalion of infantry, after which came
the four companies of the First Infantry,
and last to appear was the two companies
of light artillery. The artillery battalion
and the infantry took up positions on the
extreme right, while the artillery took up
the center, all facing Lieutenant-Colonel
Y<>ung, acting po*t-commander, who was
the revewiiiÃ officer. After the usual
ceremonies the men standing in com
ranies into line, the order "attention"' wax
given ami the lieutenant-colonel and staff
rode in front of the infantry, the First
Regiment band playing the meanwhile;
as the commander of the post approached
the artillery the biulers of that branch of
the service played a quickstep, keeping it
up until the inspecting officer had reached
the left of line, when the buglers of the
cavalry took up the refrain.
The inspecting officer and staff then
passed along the rear of the three branches
of the serv cc, nfter which they proceeded
to the reviewing stand. Then the order
was given and the companies wheeled
into column and, preceded by the band,
marched past the reviewing officer.
The neat appearance of the men, their
soldierly bearing and the regularity of
step and d: stance were the snbject nf much

favorable comment by the spectators.
After passing, the infantry moved to the
color line and siord at parade rpst, while
the nrtillery and the cavalry went by tho
reviewing officer at a walk, a trot and
then at a pail p. Both of these last
nameJ movements attracted much atten
tion and were well executed, but as the
men flashed wildly by they raised such a.
cloud ofilust that fora moment they weres
shut out from view.
Then there was tho muster and the in
spection of arms, and as each company
was inspected it marched off the field.
Belonging to the cavalry there is a.
white bulldog that takes as much delight
in the maneuvers of the troops as a hu
man heing. Friday mornin.-, "Cavalry
Jack," as this dogis called, was on the
field with the trcop, when suddenly he
was, by ortier of the officer of the day,
taken off the held by a sentry sent after
him, and he was tied up in the grand
sand. Wnat bis offense was was not
made known, but he remained very quiet
until the first sound of the bugle an
nounced the command "forward." "Cav
alry Jack" arose to answer it, but he
could not get away. When the buglers
sounded "trot" he again tried to move,
but being unable to go, let out one how!,,
and when "gallop" was sounded he
howled so long and loud that he startled
every one on the grand stand. His howls
seemed to mean "I want to De with you,
but I ain't."

29Confessions of a
Boston Girl
Two cities more distinctly different trian
Boston and San Francisco cannot be im
agined. In comparing staid, conserva
tive, Puritanical Boston with gay, cosmo
politan, rapid San Francisco, one scarcely
knows where to begin.
Californians are looked upon by East
ern people as beip.g emDlematical of hon
esty, liberality and good-fellowship. I
really think the virtue for which we
respect you more than all the oth
ers is liberality; you inhale liberality
in the air you breathe; it permeate?
all jour actions; it is a part of your reli
gion. You are to us Nature's children in
the truest sense of the word.
Perhaps it is the narrowness of our
streets that mako us narrow-minded, for
I will admit that our streets are deplor
ably narrow ana crooked. When you
take into consideration that we are cooped
up in a narrow city, getting no invigorat
ing mountain air, as you do. do you
wouder at our narrow-mindedness? We
inherit our prudishness and conservatism
from our Puiitan ancestors. It is almost

The ladies of the Trist Duplicate

of good cheer and greeting, and desire to ex
press their wLrm and hearty approval of the
movement on foot to formulate a woman's
whist league; and they hope your efforts
â¢will be crowned with the success they bo
richly deserve, aud also hope its good
influences will extend from the Atlantic to
tne Pacific, and from the Gulf of Mexico to the
land of the midnight sun. Unfortunately we
will not be able to have representation at this
first meeting on account of the shortness of
time, and Mrs. A. Elizabeth Wager Smith of
your city has been invited to present this
communication, to speak for us, to act for us
and to represent us in any and every way that
may serve the best interests of so worthy an
object.
During the days and hours of this meeting
our thoughts and hearts will be with you, and
we hope they will ever bent in unison with all
other hearts whose one great desire is to ud
hold and promote the interest of our noble
and scientific game; who will teaca our chil
dren to love it, and who will keep it pure and

homes. .

What Constitutes a Gard of Re
entry.
Milton C. Work, in "Whist of To-day," says:
"A card of re-entry is one which is sure to
win, and therefore insures the obtaining of
the iead." This is, of course, the proper dc-fi
nitlon of the term "a card of re-entry," but
how many whist-players are there who grasp
the situation. An ace of an uiiplayed suit is
a card of re-entry. Are there any others?
A good, rule to adopt in any system of play
is to consider you have a card oi re-entry
when you hold an ace, as above, or ting and
queen, or four trumps. You have only a pes
sible card of re-entry ' when you hold a king
with one or two small, queen, jack and one
email end one or two other such holdings, but
it is dangerous to count on such a holding as
a certainty of getting in. So without the pos
sibility ot great gains don't take too many
chances. Play conservative. You will surely
win more tricks in the Jong run if you do.

impossible to live in Boston and not be a
prude. The air we breathe is filled with
prude bacteria, so in the future look upon
Bostonians with a sympathizing fee ing,
for they can't help being what they are.
I verily believe that 1 had an idea that I
might be able to do a little missionary work
among San Francisco people. My high
standard of mornlit.v I secretly felt would
have a good effect upon them. Alas!
poor deluded mortal that I was. My
efforts were in vain. I was very politely
told that my ideas were all right for
*ff-te Boston, but they wouldn't "go" in
'Frisco, and, I assure you, I haven't said
anything in that line since. And, as
you well know, "contamination breeds
crime." I have to pinch my cheeks now
to bring back the blush that lornierly was
constantly there when I saw or h^ard
anything out of my Puritanical line of
thinking.
The absence of the Sunday law is what
strikes the Easterner r.s bordering on the
barbarous. In Boston the Sunday law is
enforced with the greatest amount of
ri^idiiy, and woe betide any one found
transgressing it. Imagine, if you ran,
ruy indignation when I was invited to go
to the theater the first Sunday nipbt I was
here â a theater on Sunday! Ye shades
scoring this mntch, as stated last week,
is different from the announcement
heretofore made. The total tricks won
by the north and south players of each team
nre recorded, which will show the gains and
losses and at the same time will show how
the hands run, which is certainly more ic
formatorv that the method heretofore used.

Sacramento's |JeW Whist Glub.
LaÃt Wednesday evening will be a memor
able one to the lovers of whist in the capital
city. For several weeks past the very atmos-
Dhere seemed strongly imnregnated with
whist to every one who visited Sacramento.
The storm broke last Wednesday, and nearly
200 ladies and gentlemen took shelter in
Cv.oi er's Music Hull, and organized a whist club
of 250 members, second to none in this coun
try. I
George M. Mott was unanimously elected
president, and John W. Lindner was chosen
as their secretary.
The Sacramento Record-Union of Thursday
says:
The meeting was presided over by George M.
Mott. The audience was composed chiefly of
prominent society people, and all seemed to
take a very warm intere-.t in wha 1 was said.
P. J. Tormey, president oi the Pacific Coast
Whist Association and director of the Ameri
can Whist LiCi-.gue, was the first to address the
meeting. He, with Mr. and Mrs. George E.
Bates, came all the way from San Francisco to
tell their Sncramento friends what they knew
(find what they did not knou) about the game
of whist.
Mr. Tormey relnted his experience as a
whist-player â told how he, like most players,
thought he knew all about the game until he
began to read authorities on the subjectâ and
said it was not until ne had read these author
ities that he realized how little he really
knew about playing the game as it sliould be
played, ilis remarks were enlivened by re
lating -many amusing incidents of his whiit
plnyiuÃ career, and he concluded by giving
some very practical j.dvice to the Sacramento
whist enthusiasts.

But now, you know, things have
changed. Let any one invite me again
and I assure you 1 won't give him a
chance to change his mind.
The men here are jnst the jolliest chaps
in the world. I love them all â s\ich gal
lant, whole-fouled manly men that they
are. But oh, dear! they are such a
thoughtless lot! There are so many at
tractions downtown to occupy their at
tention tnat invariably they are behind
hand in filling an engagement with the
fair sex. A c ap will have an engage

ana just as said youne lady is fussing and
fuming about hi-i dilatory ways he ap
pears upon the scene full of apologies and
excuses. Of course it was "buiiness" de
tained him, and his sorrow for keeping
the "deargiri" waiting seems so sincere
that he is forgiven, and he secretly credits
himself a* being an awfully clever fellow.
The Native Daughters are overflowing
with conviv ality. They seem too busy
enjoying themselves to pay the least bit
of attention to their neighbors' affair*.
The love of the frivolous to be found
among the Native Daughters is really
startling. The serious matters in life
they leave severely alone, Hitting, as it

I Mrs. Bates spoke for several minutes in a very
I entertaining manner. She was very witty,
| and her remarks were loudly applauded.
Mr. Bates, who is a prominent member of
| the San Francisco Whist Club, to.d of the dif
i ficulties the club hud to contend with for sev
eral years following its organization and how
it had overcome them, until now It is a strong
club, in which business and professional men
find great relaxation from the cares of
everyday life. He told the Sacramcn
tans bow to profit by the experiences of
others â how they should have convenient
quarters where members might drop in at any
time and spend an hour or two in whist.
The Santa Jtasa Journament.
The second game in the series of matches
between the various whist clubs of this city
was played at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
F. A. Brusn on East Fourth street Wednes

were, from flower to flower, gathering
only the sweetest nectar.
The only real sin that Boston girls are
guilty of, in my estimation, is inquisitive
ness regarding their neighbors. In Bos
ton your neighbor can tell you more
about your fam ly affairs than you know
you .self.
When a stranger takes up his or her
abode in any community in Boston im
mediately the tongues commence to was:.
The newcomers are a puzzle, a source of
speculation as to who and what they are,
where they came from, who knows them,
etc. These are a few of the questions that
Bostoniarcs demand a satisfactory answer
to before a stranger is treated even cour
teously. Now this is wnat our Western
brothers and sisters term our frosty air.
You must kindly bear in mind the fact
that these traits in our character are
heroditary. We cannot get outside of
them and live in Boston. I thought that
I was remarkably broad-minded until I
came to San Francisco and found that I
had merely been "existing all this time.
There is such a vast difference in the
meaning of these two words "existing"
and '"living."
I fear when my good Christian Endeavor
friends arrive from Boston they will hold
their bands up. in holy horror to' see the
demure, retiring Puritan maiden changed
into a full-fledged Californian. That is to
say, I will appear to them a full-fledged
Californian. There are a few California
traits that I refuse absolutely to acquire.
You mustn't ask ma what they are.
Many a discontented spirit will return to
Boston among the Christian Endenvorers
having lasted of the free and easy life led
by the San Franci>cans, for in this City is
represented every nationality on the globe,
except those living within the Arctic
Circle.
Now when one stops to consider, one
agrees that human nature is the same the
world over; environment being the influ
ence which determines the progress of vir
tue or vice. It so happened that the envir
onment of Boston was more of a temperate
than a wild nature, hence her high stand
ard of morality; but let me assure you
that Boston admires San Francisco for her
independent standard of morality, though
she does not often venture to say so in
public.
Dear old Boston! Can you forgive me
for my derogative remarks, but, oh, you
are so far behind the times! Why won't
you wake up and start a Mind broadening
Society so that when 1000 comes in all
your old prosaic Puritanical dogmas will
have tall shrubbery growing over their
graves.
Ban Francisco's streots are wide and
in the business section well lighted,
but oh I ;he Street-paving Department
should blush when it looks at these
cobblestones. Perhaps you don't have a
street-paving department under your City
government. How much more beneficial
to the City it would have been to have set
the unemployed to work at renovating
tne paving of the streets rather than at
buiidine a driveway that only the wealthy
class will enjoy. Necessities first and
luxuries afterward. Certainly repaying
the streets is a necessity.
The Street-paving Department of Bos
ton should be proud of its work, for it is
admitted by all visitors that Boston is one
of the best paved cities in the United
States.
I admit that the streets in Boston are
mere alleys (as far as width goes) com
pared with those of other large cities, but
we have as handsome buildings as one
could wish to see. The diminutiveness o
the buildings in San Francisco is urpris
ing to me. They are almost all suchf
dingy affairs. The now buildings are
very fine structures, and the houses, most
ot which are built of wood, are also very

It is really hard to believe that they are
wooden, liut the generals air of excel
lence is not so marked here. Your uark
is far ahead of Central Park in New York,
and the Jatter is considered the finest in
t:ie United States. Of course the great
advantage California has over the East is
that the grass and most of the trees ana
shrubs are green the year round.

The Concordia Whist Club's first match, a
challenge match for the Payot trophy, was
played in the rooms of the San Francisco
Whist Club, between the Concordia and San !
Francisco Whist club , resulting in the follow- i
ing score. This being a ''straight" whist con
test it is no test ot skill whatever, and light

Whistlets.
The Indies' trophy match In the rooms of the
San Francisco Whist Club, held Saturday, April
24, was won by Mrs. Lyser and Mrs. Levis.on,
Miss Leviston and Miss S. fi. Jenkins.
Mr. Coivin, one of the expert players of the
Vahejo Whist Ciub, spent a few evenings In
the whist clubs during the past week. Mr.
Coivin reports whist in a flourishing condi
tion in Vallejo, and he says it won't be long
before the Rideout trophy will decorate the
rooms oi their club.
R. B. Calley, the popular ex-president of tbe
Linda Vista Whist Ciub, has been '-doing" the
whist clubs of Portland, Seattle, Tncoma and
Olympia. He reports whist, in a flourishing
condition in all the cities ho has visited.
Jonathan Curtis, of the firm of Payot, Up
ham Â«t Co., and one of the leading members
of the Tr.st Duplicate Whist Club, is now in
the East. He reports that whist is as lively In
New York, Brooklyn, Boston and Philadelphia
as it is in San Francisco.
The St. Paul Globe of St. Paul, Minn., will
shortly resume the publication o: its whist ar
ticles. George L. iiunn, now Judge Bunn, con
tributed the whist articles to this journal for a
year or more. It is to be hoped that he will
favor the whist world occasionally with a few
lines at least.
Ar\sWers to Queries.
In reply to the query of comparing scores
during, a game of progressive whist we will
ray: The laws of the game are weak on that
point and will be remedied at the next con
gress. If a player U caught at it wntn he
knows it is not permitted the one in charge of
the piay should pub lcly reprimand the of
fender. It is a pernicious practice and should
be stopped.
Can the last tricK be seen when once quitted?
No. The law says the last trick cannot be seen
when once quitted. We notice a new scheme
is worked now. We are trying it When we
want to sco the last trick or any card (in
duplicate) after all four cards are quitted we
deliberately p.ck up ours, turn it over, and ask
to see the others, as though it had not
been turned and qhitted. We have never
b.'en caught at it yet.
ARTISTIC HAIR-PULLERS
Tonsorial Experts Will Litigate
Their Professional Rival
ries.
A controversy between hair-dressers thfit
may lead to capillary disturbances has
been brought to the attention of the Su
perior Court by a suit entitled Hermann
Schwarze against S. Str<zynski. It may
be said tnat their troubles have been
dragged into this forum a crinibm, or as
Virgil would say, by the hair of the head.
for on this basis they wage implacable
warfare.
Mr. Schwarze sets forth the burden of
his woes in an eloquent complaint that
was filed by Atorney Edward Lande
yesterday. In this document h? avers
that for ten ypars he has b?en "a licensed
artistic ladies' hairdresser, wig and toupee

The plaintiff further affirms that .the
defendant has been carrying on a rival es
tablishment in the same line of business,
"although all the work done or pretended
to be done by the said defendant was and
is manifestly inferior, inartistic, unsatis

This terrible accusation if followed by
a charge that the defendant "willfully.in

bad faith, inteniiiis: and attempting to in

plaintiff in said city and county, and to
wholly destroy thÂ» said reputation of

It has been found that the average pro-
fessional life of a trained nurse is only
ten years. In that time she must save up
enough for her suprjort in case of illness,
to which she is peculiarly susceptible,
owing to the nsture of her work.

Inside. If a man looks well and doesn't
feel well, he had better be governed by the
feeling not by the looks. A great many ap-
parently strong and vigorous men collapse
suddenly. They have what is known as ner-
vous prostration. They go along persist-
ently, day after day, working hard and think-
ing hard, apparently healthy, and some day
they go home and go to bed and don't get
up again. The trouble didn't all come at
once. It came on gradually. # A strong man
can live on his nerves and his health for a
long time without apparent injury, but it
isn't a safe thing to do. Whenever there is
nervousness, or insomnia, or undue fatigue
' from ordinary work, when irritability takes
the place of contentment, when a man

The Erstwhi'e Big Fruit-Growsr on

; Washings.
A. T. Hatch returned here yesterday
from the Panamint Mountain*, where he
has been prospecting since January 18.
Prior to his engaging in fruit-growing, in
which he became so conspicuous, Mr.
Hatch was for twelve years a prospector
and miner.
When he saw his vast orchards and the
whole of his fortune fall away from him
he concluded to again take up the pick
and prospector's pack. He went as far as
Mojave by rail, and thence made his way
over the desert and tinally into the
mountains of Inyo. There, with a burro
to carry bis heaviest effects, he bravely
climbed the heights of the Panamint
range and began to look for outcroppings
of quartz.
â¢'One of my old friends had grubstaked
me," he said, "and so I thought I would
see if I couldn't get some gold out of the
ground by mining. I located two or three
claim*, but I don't Know yet whether
they are eood for anything. It is very
hot on the desert, but cool and pleasant in
the mountains. I got in a little while bo
I felt better than I had in years. I lost a

THE YOUNGEST OF HALES CALIFORNIA STORES.
FIVE YEARS OLD TO-MORROW.
We opened our store in San Francisco May 3d; 1892. Despite panics, hard times, and competition,
we steadily increased our output, enlarged our premises, established our reput ation for honorable deal-
ing and developed a trade represented by the best ladies of San Francisco. It has been our aim to please
you. We have asked no favors beyond a fair comparison of quality and price. This, our anniversary
week, we intend to make memorable by the high class of merchandise offered, the low prices quoted
and the number of departments represented by choice specials ready for the asking.

I SOMETHING WHICH THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW !
? Ist. Mr. Doane stated to us that the stock of Doane & ?
0 Henshelwood would invoice between $15,000 and $16,000. The g
6 Emporium advertises it as wortn $75,000 of Dry Goods. 6
X 2nd. Mr. Doane offered to sell us the Doane & Henshel- X
* wood stock at 77|c on the dollar and stated to us that he would |
9 not accept less than 75c on the dollar. The Emporium adver- $
9 tises that they bought this stock for 31c on the dollar. o
1 6 3d. That is a remarkable statement in view of Mr. Doane's 6
$ refusal to consider an offer of less than 75c on the dollar from X
X another firm, and if the statement is true it is easy for the Empor- 2
jjj iumto prove it. If it is not true the statement is grossly unjust to g
$ other merchants. If it is true and the Emporium proves $
? its truth we will donate $1000 to the Balboa Boulevard Fund, 6 .
o and have deposited $1000 with the Examiner for that purpose. 6
5 The distribution of this sum among the needy unemployed Â§
5 should certainly compensate the Emporium for the slight trouble X
X they would be put to in proving their statements if they were true, 9
1 4th. We are willing to submit the issue to the Honorable Mayor g
9 James Phelan for decision if the managers of the Emporium o
o desire to prove their statement true within one week of the date o
6 of this paper. 6

that I could eat anything. Pork and
beans were sreat and slapjacks and strong
coffee tasted better by iar than 1 had
known in years. Even when the dint and
sand got mixed up with the food, as it did
sometimes when the wind blew strong, it
didn't seem to make any difference.
"I camped one night in a canyon right
alongside of Panamint' Tom. the Indian
who is alleged to have killed so many
people, and he made no effort to disturb
me. though I happened to have more than
the $10 for which he is said to be so ready
to kill a man. I also saw and ulked to
the men who were killed off by the Rands
burg correspondent. This Indian is no
such desperate character as has been
charged.
'â¢Randsburg, I found on my return, was
a good deal better off after losing a third
of its population. The country is staked
off for miles around there, but as yet ihere
are only a few mines developed. There is
a good deal of dry washing around there,
and a good deal of money comes in from
that source, so that one way and other the
business men of Randsburg have a pretty
fair amount of money."

SUDDEN DEATH.
Alonzo Richards, Hack-Driver, Found
Dead in Bed Yesterday
Morning.
Alonzo Richards, a hack-driver, was
found dead in bed a: 9:45 o'clock yester
day morning in his room at 1053 Howard
street. He had been afflicted with lung
trouble for some lime, ami on the day be
fore had a serious hemorrhage. He was a
siDgle man, and had been rooming at the
residence of Mrs. Mary McManus for sev
eral months. His failure to rise at his
usual hour attracted her aitention, and
she called in a neighbor and opened the
door.
The Coroner was notified, and the body
was removed to the Morgue. There is no
dcubt that deaih resulted from natural
causes.
Wanted to Be Released.
Dr. Arthur Marten was recently declared in
sane by a jury and committed to the Ukiah
Asylum. Yesterday, by his attorney, he pe
titioned the Supreme Court lor a writ of
habeas corpus, stating that the commitment
was illegal, as one of the jurors had expressed
his doubts as to Manen being insane. His
petition was denied.

BRIDGES' PUN TO
ABOLISH BRIDGES
It Meets With No Favor
by the Southern Pa
cific Company.
Some of the Objections Urge:)
to It by the Railroad
People.
It Would Interfere With the Present
Frequent Service to Oakland
and Alameda.
Lyman Bridges' project to abandon all
bridges over the estuary known as Oak
landjharbor meets with no encourage
ment from the officials of the Southern
Pacific, and if the present attitude of the
company does not undergo some radical
change, there will be at least one hand
some and substantial bridgo connecting
the towns of Oakland and Alameda in the
vicinity of Oak street.
On Monday a proposition is to be pre
sented to the Supervisors of Alameda
County for the construction of a tonuel
from the foot of Broadway, under the
creek, to the south side of tne harbor, for
the use of wagons, streetcars and pedes
trians, and to prevent the Southern Pa
cific or any other railroad from building
a bridee across the harbor.
At the offices of the railroad company
the idea is treated as not being worth
serious consideration, and as being im-
practicable, so far as doing away with a
railroad bridge is concerned.
Three serious obstacles, it Is claimed by
the people, stand in the way of
carrying out the plan outlined by Bridges,
who also contemplates carrying all the
Alameda traffic to the narrow-gauge mole
and all the Oakland traffic to tbo broad
gauge mole, tbus obviating the necessity
of a bridge.
"Tue greatest objection to this plan,"
said one of the chief officers of the South
ern Pacific Company, "would come from
the residents of the two cities across the
bay and also from many San Francisco
people. To all who use the lerries it
would mean that instead of having the
use of both ferry lines for reaching either
Oakland or Alameda, they would be con
fined to the narrow-gauge for Alameda
and the broad-gauge for Oasland, with
the incidental result that they would be
getting only half-hourly and hourly ser
vice, according to 'he time of day, in
stead of quarter-hourly and half-houily
service, as is now the case.
"Then ther>* wouid undoubtedly be a
protest from the bondholders and stock
holders of the narrow-gauge toad, as that
would be deprived of the present propor
tion of the Oakiand traffic, and woulrt
thus have its revenues considerably re
duced.
"Tnirdly, it would deprive the Southern
Pacific Company of the revenue it derives
lrorn carrying passengbrs between Oak
land and Alameda, which cuts consider
able figure, and would throw this traffic
to the streetcar line that operates be
tween the two cities. And it must be re
membered that many people prefer the
train for this trip."
