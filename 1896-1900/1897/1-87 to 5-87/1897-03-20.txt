ATHENS, Gdekce. March 19.â Germany
and. Russia are popularly considered to be
the worst enemies Greece has in the con
certof Europe, and if the reports that are
in circulation are true there can be no
doubt that Russia's animosity is but a
veil.to cover her always present desire to
obtain part of the furnish terriTory, de
spite her declaration ia support Joi
the integrity of the Ottoman em
pire. What Germany's real object
U' has not transpired, but it is snp
poseci that she is inspired by a desire to
.stand well with Russia in the hope of
breaking the Franco-Russian alliance. It
is stated that there is a secret Russo-
Turk.su treaty in existence providing that
in return lor the support Russia is now
giving Turkey (he ports of Suda and Is
kanderun will be ceded to her. Of course,
i' is impossible to tell what there is in the
rumors that are being circulated, and
tney are only {riven to sliow in what light
Russia ia regarded by the Greek people.
It ia rumored that Russia is urging
Turkey to attack Greece, <ffering official
pssirtance to the Porte if th s be done.
Russia believes that the fir t battle would
result in a defeat of thp Greek troops, and
sbe con.'d then call oft Urn Turks and pro
pose terms that Greece would be bound to
accept.
A new feature in the situation has de
veloped which threatens to result in seri
ous complications, and ranch interest is
manifested here as to how the powers
will view tne matter. The Turks are en
paged in constructing fortifications. This
work is in direct violation of the treaty of
Berlin. The Government has made pro
tests to the poweis against this action on
tbe part of Turkey. Great indignation is
felt here that tbe powers should stand
aupinely by and see Turkey violate the
Berlin treaty, but the impression grows
that to gain their own ends tbe Christian
countries of Europe will submit to any
thing in support of the Turks.
The first regiment of infantry started
to-day for Larissa. Prayers were offered
prior to their departure, which was wit
nessed by large crowds of cheering spec
tators.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, March
19.â rThe serious attention of the Porte has
been called by the. Servian Minister here
to tbe serious state of things existing in
the province of Kossovo, where, tne Min
ister asserted, in consequence of the
mobilization of the 1 urkish reserves, the
Christians have become pnnic-Btricken.
The Minister also called attention to the
recent attack of a Moslem upon the Aus
trian and Servian Consuls in a cafe at
Usukub, in the province of that uume.
Servia, he said, had maintained a per
fectly correct attitude during the present
crisis and hoped that the Porte would put
a stop to the existing situation; otherwise
the consequence* might be serious.
GALATZ, Rocjiaitca, March 19.â 1t Is
reported in Greek circles here that the
Greeks in Conitantinople, of whom 30,000
are well armed, are plotting a revolt
against tbe Suitan's Government The
: report says that advantage is being taken
I of the fact that apart Worn the Sultan's
y^ bodyguard there are fe# Turkish troops
at Constantinople, all available force
being sent to the Greek frontier, and that
in the event of an uprising at Constanti
nople it would be impossible to recall
troops from the frontier in time to make
them effective against a revolt. Recently
a large body of Greeks left here, ostensi
bly for Greece, but it is now said that their
real destination was Constantinople.
CAXEA, Caxn March 19.â An Italian
officer hns started for the camp of the
Greek troops with instructions to notify
Colonel VasÂ»o3 that, the blockade of the
island will begin at 8 o'clock Sunday
morning, in accordance with ihe procla
mation Issued by ihe foreign admirals.
Preparations are being made for the ar
rival of the foreign troops.
Barracks are in readiness, and in some
cases schoolhouses will be used for tbe
â¢lodging of the troops. The admirals have
bad another interv.ew with the insurgent
leaders at Alltroti. They handed to the
Cretans copies of the proclamation claim
ing the autonomous government would
be- constituted for the island; but this in
telligence was not received iv the manner
it was hoped it won d be. The rebel
leaders did not hesitate to express their
hostility to the plan of the powers to
leave them under the suzerainty of the
â Sultan. They finally declared that they
were done with Turkey, and added that
they would resist to their last drop ol
blood any such regime as the powers pro
posed. Their desire was to have the
island annexed to Greece, and they would
hold out until this became an established
fact. Among the few supporters of the
powers the attiiude of the insurgent lead
ers is ascribed to counsels given to them
. some time ago by the Greek Vice-
Consul.
The Vienna correspondent of the Times
The San Francisco Call
telegraphs that it is semi-officially re
ported in that city twat Austria and Ger
many will not take part in any operations
that may be decided upon as necessary in
tbe interior of Crete.
A dispatch to tbe same paper from
Athena says that the entire population
assembled to-night to witness the depar
ture of the first regiment of infantry for
Laris-a. The crowd cheered incessantly
as the troops passed along. Several band*
of music escorted the Boldiers and many
persons in the crowds fired revolvers as
noisy farewells to the departing troops.
Crown Prince Constantino has not yet
gone to tbe front. He will remain in
Athens for the present.
The Times thinks it highly probable
that if the Greek rortsare blockaded there
will immediately be war with Turkey, but
if they are not blockaded war may be
averted.
The Times to-morrow will print a dis
patch from Constantinople saying that
three torpedo-boats, two torpedo-boat de
stroyers and one cruiser steamed from the
inner Golden Horn into the sea of Mar
mora last night and then proceeded to
Gallipolis, there to await the rest of the
Turkish squadron, which will sail to-mor
row. This s,quaaron will consist of three
armored frigates of 6000 tons and ten guns
each, one iron-clad corvette of 2000 tons
and fifty guns and one river boat. The
squadron will await orders at Gallipolis.
According to a dispatch from Larissa
the Turkish Consuls in Thessaly have
been authorized by the Porte to vacate
their posts and return to Constantinople,
A RINGING APPEAL TO AMERICANS ON BEHALF OF CUBA.
"Is It True/ Asks an Heir of the Great Revolution, "That We Are at Last
About to Consider the Cause of this Downtrodden People ?"
TO THE EDITOR OF THE CALL : So it is really true, is it, that the representa
tive citizens of this portion of the American community are going to assemble in
Metropolitan Temple this evening and d;vote themselves seriously to a discussicn of
Cuba's condition ? I, for one, do not wish to build my hopes too high, but 1 think
you have actually stated that we are at last to ascertain definitely what the people
of one large American unit think of the Cuban insurgents' cause. Is it not so?
You will pardon an heir of the American Revolution if he lets a tinge of irony
or a suggestion of incredulity creep into these lines after so maddening a period of
disappointment as he has undergone while waiting for something to be done for Cuba
by his countrymen. When he has reflected that his countrymen owe every tree
breath that they draw to a rebellion of their forefathers against the tyranny of a
European power, a rebellion that is paralleled to-day by the Cuban uprising against
Spain, and that, notwithstanding this glaring fact, his countTymen have steadily
refused to approve the policy in Cuba to-day which made free men of themselves in
1776 â when he has reflected upon the unconscionable human indecency that par
alyzed the refined sensibilities of the whole world, he has been rendered fairly dumb
with rage, despair and strangled confidence in humanity.
It is, therefore, not at all strange, Mr. Editor, that, after such a bitter trial to
his patience, such a blank and prolonged period of disappointment, he should have
finally ended his chafing and cursing in a sigh of resignation, and ceased to believe
that men of to-day could have any noble sentiments left in their grasping and sor
did souls. To be assured that he was mistaken, were ever so slightly, is to
have a cup of nectar raised to his lips. To be able to drink it in large grateful
draughts without having it dashed to the flooor is to be comforted unspeakably.
And, having drained it to the last delicious drop, Mr. Editor, refreshed and exultant
in our exauisite intoxication, we American commoners â we of the homely, fire
side community who comprise the muttering masses â we take off our hats, lift up
our voices and reverently say, "Thank God that it is so!"
Once aroused to the point of action, the citizens of San Francisco â who may
be taken as a criterion of the whole American populace â will, without the
smallest doubt, do their incidental thinking and speaking in complete accord with
the motive of the said action. They are acting for the purpose of affirming that
they think Cuba ought to be freed from Spain's tyranny. Indubitably their think
ing so is the thing that has inspired them thus to meet.
It is perfectly clear beforehand that their meeting can mean nothing else than an
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY MORNING, MARCH 20, 1897.
should they deem such action advisable.
This, the report says, is in consequence of
the Consuls having called tbe attention of
the Porte to the threatening attitude of
the Greeks on the frontier.
In the House of Lords to-day Lord
Salisbury made a bitter criticism upon the
speech uelivered by Lord Kimberley, Min
ister of Foreign Affairs in the Rosebery
Cabinet, at the meetincr of the National
Liberal Federation at Norwich Wednes
day evening, in which he asserted that
"according to Lord Salisbury the policy of
France is also that of Great tsri :ain and is
based upon tbe maintenance of the integ
rity of the Ottomon Empire."
This assertion. Lord Salisbury said, was
wholly untrue-, if, he continued, the
policy of the Liberal party was to aban
don the Ottoman Empire it had been
lately; adopted. Lord Kimberley would
probably again become Foreign Minister
of Great Britain and, in th:it event, he
asked, would his Lordship then disregard
the past policy of maintaining the integ
rity of the Ottomon Empirp.
Lord Kimberley replied that he had in
tended wnat he had said to mean that the
Liberal party woul 1 depart entirely from
its pasi Dolicy regarding Turkey and
maintained that the Ottomon Empire was
a standing menace to the peace ol Europe.

CONSTERNATION IN CHICAGO.
'Ik kf Cloud- of $m. ajti? â¢' Fog Earehpa :
ihe City and Great If Alarms the
Populace.
CHICAGO. 111., March 19.â Chicago
became almost panic-stricken about 4:15
o'clock, this afternoon, when a dense
cloud of smote and fog passed over the
city and enveloped it in almost complete
darkness. From tbe upper windows in
many of the large buildings in the down
town district pedestrians and vehicles on
the street could not be Been and cable-cars
were brought to a standstill to avoid col
lisions. The entire sRy was blackened in
an instant as the cloud swept over the
town. v '" :' :' 1 ;â  l . "- " :
In the residence districts the sudden
semblance of night caused much fear.
Many believed that a severe storm was
upon the city and pedestrians ran for
shelter.
Passengers on elevated trains vacated
the cars and sought places of greater
safety in case of a storm. The darkness
lasted, however, only a few minutes and
the cloud passed on over the lake.
It is explained that the blackness re
sulted from the sudden chnng â¢ of the
wind. All day the atmosphere was damp
and the smoke hovered in the sky over
head. Tbe wind shifted and the smoke
and fog were forced down, forming a
dense cloud, which almost entirely shut
out the sunlight.
About 9 o'clock to-night there was a
severe hailstorm, which lasted but a few
indorsement of the Cubans' rebellion, and there will be no human being present with
sufficient courage to confirm audibly the stupid idea of our having nothing to do
with the case, which his silence hitherto may have implied. We have every
thing to do with the case, or at least as much to do with it as we care to have.
Who shall stop us? Who stops us from sending money to Ireland to help on the
cause of "home rule"? We do that remarkable thing every year, or oftener, and
no Britisher thinks of interfering; yet when we float one of our little merchant
vessels down past Cuba, mayhap to some other port, it is seized and confiscated by
some Spanish pirate, and we are offered in mitigation of the high-handed
the insulting explanation that we must not send "stores to the rebels." Bah !
Why doesn't some American on one of our ships down that way seize the thieving
dogs and hang every mother's son of them up for the gulls to peck at. Isn't
there one man among the United States crews in those waters?
This appalling apathy in America while Cuba writhes under a thousand atrocities
every day is enough to wring blood from one's eyes and raise the hair clear out of
one's scalp. Only a few hundred miles from a Government which was born in
war and which has been reared in over one hundred years of independence lies a
land which is trying to give birth to a government on the same lines and from
the same conception. Here stands the Republic of a century's growth, rich,
powerful, a match for the world in a conflict, comfortably independent, immured
from threats or encroachmentsâ a Republic in a position to laugh at enemies and
to patronize friends ; here stands this very ideal of republican conception, with
its powerful arms folded, while just a little space away goes on, unaided
by it, the struggle of a new life into the family of independent nations.
At the throat of Cuba the hand of one of the most terrible tyrants
and butchers of war that was ever known is clutching and straining to
squelch the life that threatens to unfold from his convulsive victim. Her retainers
are murdered in cold blood, private citizensâ some of them American citizens
are hacked to pieces, babes are taken by the heels and brained, against trees and
telegraph poles, women are^ worse than killed, humanity in general, white and
black and all defenseless, is being maimed beyond the most devilish modes of tor
ture that human butchery ever before invented. Talk about such trivial Incidents
as the murder of Blanche Lamont or any other individual whose death we have
read of with bulging eyes in recent print; talk about anything like that being "the
crime of the century," some newspaper has put it! Why, Durrant and Holmes
minutes. A heavy rain prevailed much of
the time since early this morning.

DEPEW'S LIGHTNING RIDE.
Covers a Long Distance in Remarkably
Fast T.me in Order lo Attend a
Meeting.
NEW YORK, W, V., March 19.â There
was a meeting of the Board of Regents
in Albany yesterday afternoon and Chaun
cey M. Depew was present. He had been
looked for on the Empire State express,
but had bsen detained in this city. Never
theless he arrived on time by taking a
special train, which made one of the fastest
runs on record over the 143 miles to the
State capital.
The special was composed of Depew's ,
private car, No. 100, an ordinary car, car
ried for ballast, and locomotive 897, one
of the big new engines. Ed Gerrity was
at the engine's throttle and Ed Mindler
was in charge of the train. The start was
made from the Grand Central station at
26 minutes after 12 o'clock, and the run
was made in two hours thirty-six minutes
and nine seconds, which is four minutes
faster than the running time of the Em
pire State express.
This trip does not break the record,
however, for on September 11, 1895, a
special train to Albany over the same
road made the run in 134 minutes and 25
seconds, being pulled by the famous loco- i
motive No. 999, in order to show the E ig
li-b, who were then wildly excited over a
series of railway races between London |
and Aberdeen, that they should look to
ttis slrte of the water if they wanted to
see what fast traveling really was.
,f-'.;^Â
Taking; into consideration the neces
sarily limited speed attainable in the New
York City tunnel and until the train
passed Spuyten Duyvil the average speed
was a fraction in excess of a mile a
minute.

having been put in by her owner, Ogden
Goelet, only to comply T?itn the condi

three starters. Th race was won .by the

of the Britannia. The race for the Hirsch

which beat the Britannia by four minutes.
Sleam*r liurned at Sea.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 19-The
steamer Rialto, from Newcastle for New
York with a general cargo, took fire and
was abandoned at sea. The crew was
brought here by the steamer Carthagi
nian, which arrived this morning from
Glasgow.
I are angels compared with the monstrous scoundrels of the Spanish invading army
iin Cuba, led by that crowning masterpiece of mortal sin, General Weyler.
May the devil help the governors and soldiers of Spain if God sees them in their
present villainy"!
It is the invocation of every sane American that the administration at
Washington do something to end this conflict. Enough has been babbled in
Congress and sat upon in the Presidential chair. American citizens have been mur
dered by Spanish marauders even while the American President was out catching
a cold while trying to catch fish. Our countrymen have languished in Spanish
dungeons while our Congress and our Cabinet have lolled about in drawing
rooms. With ships enough to blow Spain out of the water and over into
France we stand smilingly by, fatuously coddling the thing, we call our national
honor, and all the while the cruel indignities go on accumulating, the butcheries go
on multiplying, the principle of independence (whereof we profess to be so jealous)
goes on being insulted, trodden under the heel and degraded before the scornful
gaze of the old monarchial world.
Should we not interfere? Did France not interfere when Britain was oppressing
i us? And think of the difference in the two cases in the former's favor. Britain
was far less malignant and cruel to us than Spain is to the Cubans. That is
one difference. And France was an empire, like Britain, instead of a republic
like we hoped to be; wherefore her natural sympathy should have been
with the oppressor. That is another difference. And France was not by any
tie of proximity or of principle other than graciousness expected to interest herself
in our infantile struggle. That is still another difference. All of those things
are reversed in Cuba's favor in the present case. It is our positive duty, to say
nothing better of it, to acknowledge the insurgents as belligerents ; to open our
money markets to their bonds ; to sell them munitions of war and to protect
them from any excesses [of conventional warfare. Let them fight man tojm.in.
gun to gun, and let us maintain order, forbid murder and clothe our representa
tives in Cuba with authority that will command respect. Let no more humilia
tion cover the stars and stripes in that or any other land. We commoners of the
masses tell you, g ntlemen, that we have had enough of it. We are sickened and
disgusted and ashamed. Our heads hang low ; our spirit is bent ; our patriotism is
discouraged. Do something to-night, my fellow-men, or thereafter subside into the
disgrace and dishonor of civilized nonenity and stay there.

HAVANA, CtÃ.v, March in.â Advices

the rebels made an altacK upon the town

Cuba, inflicting considerable damage. The
insurgents were finally repulsed by the
garrison and retired, leaving eleven dead
on the field, and carrying a number of

The losses of the enemy included six of

NEW YORK, N. V., March 19.â The
Cuban cause met with a loss by tlie sink
ing of the French steamer St. Naza. re.
Nicholas A. KavenalJ, one of the passen
gers, was a colonel in the Cuban army.
He was an agent sent by General (Jalisto
Garcia from Cuba with a letter to General
Palraa of the Cuban junta in New York,
asking for artillery and dynamite. The
colonel had escaped from Cuba by crossing
to Jamaica in a small Indian canoe,
making the trip in two days. He tuen
made his way to New York, and was to
have returned with 1 the Roloff expedition,
but for some reason fulled to connect with
the Lauraua, and took passage in the Si.

A World special from Tampa, Fla,,
says: "Thirty-five Cubans left hero to

Spain to Late Cubm in Confronting a
Monte Jterolution.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 19.â A dis
patch to the Sun from Havana says: All
the news confirms tbe belief that a fatal
crisis for Spain is approacnins. The cable
dispatches received here from Madrid say
that the agitation by Carists and Repub2
licans continues. The newspapers which
support the Government hold ud the
threat to the papers opposed to it that
they will be suspended if they print news
adverse to Spain's interests.
An editorial published by La Epoca,
Cauovas' organ, has been transmitted by
cable to Havana. It says that the agita
tion promoted by Carlists, Republicans
and filibusters will oblige the Government
to suspend constitutional rights over
Spain and Uke strong measures to main
tain public order in Madrid and the pro
vinces.
The Spaniands in Havana are alarmed
: over the situation and say that the lirst
. shot tired in Spain will mean the utter loss
of Cuba. The news from the Philippine
Islands also continues to De unfavorable to
the Spaniards and all the signs are against
â¢Spanish success.
The terrible insubordination of the
Spanish army in Cuba is caused by the
defection due to Weyler's conduct. From
the generals down to the soldiers every
one complains of the captain-general, the
soldiers on account of the ill treatment
they suffer and the officers of hiehest
rank because, as they assert, 'Weyler
envies them, treats them unfairly and
.tries to shirk his responsibility for the
failure of the campaign, attributing it to
his subordinates.
As soon as the news came to Havana of
the landing of an expedition in Pinar del
Rio, Weyler sent an angry dispatch to
General Melguizo, in which he said that
the filibusters might have been captured
had *t not bean for Meiguizo's own care
lessness. Melguizo answered in similar
heated words, saying that the fault lay at
the door of Weyler and the Naval Depart
ment.
The result was that Weyler recalled
Meleuizo from the field and ordered him
to depart for Spain.
Fome of the other generals are in the
same situation, and one of them has pub
licly said in Havana: "General Weyler
is a monster from the point of view of hu
manity. His instincts are beasily. He is
a leech upon the public treasury and is al
ways thirsty for gold."
A colonel and a lieutenant have been
court-martialed by General Weyler and
put in jail on account of the bold attack
. of the insurgents upon Guines, reported
last week. But Weyler has no real cause
to accuse these officers, and bis attitude
toward them is a ereat injustice. The in
surgents were enabled to make this suc
cessful attack an account of Weyler's own
ortiers, for ne had the be3t Spanish troops
in the province of Havana, including those
at Guines, sent to him last month to the
province of Santa Clara.
The Cubans Dave again attacked Be
jucal, and with the same result as in their
â  earlier attack. The attack was led by
General Aranjo. Several houses were de
stroyed, and the garrison, as at Guines,
had to fortify itself at the church. Many
stores were ransacked by the Cubans and
.plenty of provisions were secured.
This is not the only instance of recent
fignting in the province of Havana near
the capital itself. The sugar estate in
Central Salvador was attacked by the
patriots and its splendid sugar-cane fields
burned. Some resistance was attempted
by the garrison, but it had to yield after
nine soldiers had been killed and eighteen
wounded,
Near Rincon a train carrying Spanish
. Boldiers was blown up wth dynamite by
the Cubans. The armored car was utterly
destroyed and six soldiers were killed and
many wounded.
In Pinar del Rio province the insurgents
show also grea* activity. An engagement
â¢ is reported in which the Spanish Colonel
Menar confes-ed that his column had met
witn heavy losses. He iiives no details,
from which it is inferred that he was
badly defeated.
SIOJRT Of lUE &TRVGGLE.
Some of the Outrages WMch Have Kindled
G'toeral Wrnth.
A brief epitome of the Cuban struggle
for freedom during the last eighteen
months is ?.s follows:
By the Ist of October, 1895, a provisional
government had been estabiisned, a constitu
lion promulgated and a flag adopted, On the
lOih oi October Baracoa, an important seaport
in Northeastern Cuba, was blown up by the
rebels, and on the same day a division of the
Spanish army under Cortina and Diaz was
. completely routed.
The biggest battle of the month was at Mount
Jlojfote between Maceo with 800 Cubans and
Isavarro and Linares with 2000 Spaniards.
In spite of these great odds the Spaniards
were defeated alter five hours' fighting. A
Dumber of successes followed, "Ahich gave
promise that the Cubans would soon win, but
Geu ral Pando was now sent from Spain with
30,000 fresii troops, with instructions to push
the war with vigor.
Eeriy in December the patriots suffered two
. defeats, but by the 10th of tne month re
deemed them with the victory of La Virginia.
On the 23d the Cubans entrapped 3000 Soan
iards ai Palmnrito and nearlr obliterated* the
entire force. The insurgents were now em
boldened by their successes to invade the
province of Havana, but tney were driven out
Lv two severe defea:s.
The close of 1895 found the Cubans in pos
session of more i ban one-half the island and
vaiian tly disputing the possession of the other
half with the Spaniards.
The year 1896 opened with bright prospects
for the insurgeuts, and by the capture of a
number of garrisoned towns they obtained
quantities of arms and ammunition. All the
railroads leading from Havana were destroyed
and Gomez had his cavalry finely mounted
and the Spanish infantry could accomplish
nothing agiinst them.
On the 17th of January General Campos was
recalled to Spain. He hai been employ ing
100,000 men tn the fruitless attempt to put
down the rebellion, and had expended over
$19,000,000. General Weyler was appointed
to take his place, and reached Cuba on the
10th oi February.
On the Ist of February Cisneros Betancourt,
the President of the Cuban republic, issued
an address to the people of the United States
in which he slated that he selected the United
States to make tne appeal to because they had
themselves suffered oppression and felt the
iron heel of the tyrant. It closed with these
words: "Cuba, the bleeding, appeals to her
American sisters. She does ie in the name of
God. of justice, of civilization and of Amer
ica."
This address produced a profound sensation
for the Cubans to the United States.
General Weyler reorganized the military
forces as soon as he arrived and placed the
country under martial law. He added to thÂ«
long line oi formications called the "trocha,"
and manned them with 50.000 troops. The
trocha is three miles in width and twenty-two
miles in length, und extends across the island.
It has frequently been pierced by Cuban
forces.
"Early in March Gomez invaded the province
of Havana with 1:2,000 men and destroyed
railroads aud bridges up to a few miles of the
city of Havana.
In March a Spanish column was defeated by
'the Cuban genera!, Maceo. At this time the
whole insurgent army oi Cuba was estimated
at 60,000, and the Spaniards had 200,000 on
the island.
One of the most desperate battles of the war
was fought in April in the province of Pinar
del Rio, in which Maceo was victor over the
Royalists, but was defeated with heavy loss
when he attempted to take tho city of La
Pal ma.
In May the rainy season began and impor
tant military operations were practical y sus-
Early in July a serious battle was
Fought at Xajosa. It lasted forty hours and
was a drawn battle. In a tight near Santa Ana
the rebels uuiier Garcia were badly defeated.
In August the Royalists met a disastrous de
feat at Bnvamo.
In September there were some unimportant
skirmishes. The Spanish soldiers were in bad
health and 10,000 of them were in the hos
pitals.
In the month of October YVeylÂ«r made an
elaborate plan to capture Maceo /in the pro
vince of Pinar del Rio, but miserably failed.
The Spanish commander now determined to
take the field in person against Maceo. The
province of Havana was vow almost entirely
surrounded by tne rebels and attacks on out
posts were frequent. In the first encounter be
tween Weyler and Maceo the former was se
verely defeated. This brings the History down
to a time when the events are closer and fresh
in the memory of those most interested in Cu
ban affairs. ,

BERLIN, Germany, March 19.â The de

extra naval credits was resumed in the
Reichstag to-day.
Count Posad owsky-Wehner, Secretary
of the Imperial Treasury, maintained that
the financial position of the treasury and
the country was excellent and entirely
adequate to bear the increased outlay de
manded for the increase of the navy.
Herr yon Vollmar (Social-Democrat)
condemned the whole military and naval
policy of the Government. The Reich

conflict with the Government, but if such
a condition of thint-s must arise it were
better that the issue should be fought out

Dr. yon Bennigson (National-Liberal)
strongly advocated the granting oi the

AN EMBARhASSIHG LAW.
Troubles of a Young Couple Who Wished
to B9 Married in the District of
Columbia.
NEW YORK. Â». V., March 19.â A Sun
special from "Washing on says: On tbe
statute-books of the District of Columbia
is a law relating to the marriage of foreign
peode which causes muca trouble. The
bill was introduced into Congress by Sen
ator Faulkner of West Virginia. It pro
vides that when persons who are citizens
of a foreign country wish to get married
in the district, they may produce a cer
tificate from the Mayor or Consul of
their native country to the effect that all
the laws of that country had been com
p.led with before a marriage certificate
can oe supplied.
This Jaw was enacted in a belief that it
would serve to some extent to protect
American girla, e>pecially heiressea, from
be.ns married by titled fore.guers, who
would return to their own country aud re
pudiate the marriage a-j soon as they liad
obtained tne dowry. So far as known there
has been no good accomplished by this
statute, but many persons have been
caused considerable annoyance.
An instance of this kind occurred in the
office* of the City ClerK yesterday when
George C. Hensey, the son ot Thomas G.
Hensey, a well-known real estate uea.tr,
attempted to ob.ain a license ior his mar
riage to Mis^ Marguerite Quionio of New
York. Hensey was accompanied by nis
affianced to the City Hal-. Miss Uuionio
is a beautiful girl ol about 19, a lady in looks
attire and manner. The couple were re
ferred to Lity Cierk Smith, who made out
the license iv the usual form. Just before
issuing it, however, he asked them if they
were both citizens of the Qnited States.
Miss Quionio replied that sue had been
brought to this country from England
when she was 5 years of age, and that she
hau lived nere for fourteen years. Her
mother lived in California, but she had
been adopted at an early age by an aunt in
New York and lived there.
She could not swear that her mother
had ever become naturalized, which made
it necessary for her to secure a certificate
from the British Embassador, Sir Julian
Pauncefote, to the effect that she was eli
gible to marry according to tue laws of
England. Miss Quionio and Mr. Heusey(
went to the British embassy to secure the
required certificate, but were inioruied by
the Kinbassa Jor that he could not issue it
without being Bxst notified that the girl's
mother was wilting that the marriage
should take place, Miss Quionio being un
der age according to English law.
As her rnotner is in California the per
mission ceuld not be obtained, and they
returned to the City Hall to notify the
clerk that the Embassador had retusea
the certificate. It was then su^ested that
Miss Quionio take out tier lirst papers for
naturalization, which would except her
from the rule. This she was unable* to do,
as sue would save to produce a witness
who could swear to her having been in
this country lor a certain term of years,
whicn she was unable to do, her relatives
Bnd frienus being in New York.
The matter was finally given ud, and
the couple will be compelled to go to Bal
timore or Alexandria or somewhere else
outside of the district before the ceremony
can be performed. The most peculiar cir
cumstance of the case is that tbe moment
Miss Quionio becomes Mrs. Hensey she
becomes an American citizen, and it
makes no difference whether she is under
age in England or not.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 20, 1897.
INADEQUATE IS
THE REVENUE
Dingley Submits the Tariff
Bill to the House of
Representatives.
Makes an Interesting Report,
Showing tin NÂ°cessity of In
creased Duties.
Deficiencies That Aggregate Over
Fifty Millions a Year Constantly
Increasing.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 19.â
Representative Din^ley of Maine, chair
man of the Conimittse on Ways ana
Means, to-day reported the tariff bill to
t'.e House. The report accompanying
the measure, which waÂ» written by Ping
ley, is as follows:
For nearly four years our revenue has been
inadequate to meet the expenditures and pny
the interest on the war debt. The deficiency
durins this period has been us follows; Fiscal
year ended June 30, 1 894, $69,803,260; 1895,
$43,805,223; 1896, $25,203,246; 1897 (esti
niite.i), $65,000,000. TotÂ»l deficiency, $'.$03,
--811,729.
A continuous deficinncy of revenue for four
years, amounting in the aggregate to more
than Â£203.000,000, or over $50,000,000 per
annum in lime of peace, with the official esti
mate of tbe late Secretary of the Treasury in
his last annual report that under existing
conditions there veil) be a further deficiency
of $45,000,000 for the fiscal year, whicn will
begin on the first day of July next, aud the
further fact that the Government has been
obliged to obtain means 10 pay this debt by
tiorrowing $203,000,000, on which the peop.e
are paying mierest, clearly justifies the convo
cation of Congress to devise & prompt and
adequate remedy.
The fRCt must not be lost sight of that while
the Government has during tins time sold
bonds of the value of $J62, 315,400, from
which it has realized $293,4eU,894 in gold,
for the purpose of paying its tienvnd notes
presented lor ledemption, yet $203,000 000 of
these notes so redeemed nave been again paid
out to meet, the deficit, and thus made avail
ab.e for a second redemption requiring a second
and a third issue ot bonds. Thus It will be
seen that in the la*t analysis $203.000,<J00,
or, including the mntured Pacific Railroad
bonds, nearly $215,000,000 of the $293,500.
--000 ot borrow d told have been used to sup
ply an insufficiency of revenue. And worse
still, the prnct'.cal us? of this reserve, or
(what is the same thing) the notes paid trom
the reserve to meet iricse continuous defi
ciencies of revenue, has been the potent cause
of the distrust which, has existed in business
circles.
Neither does the fact that on the first day of
March there wis a casti balance in the treas
ury of nearly $196,000,000, alter deducting
the unavailable fractional silver aud minor
coin, change the necessity of additional re
serve at the eÂ»rlieet posslbledate, lor the rea
son that at least $15,000,000 of this will be re
quired to meet the dt-ticiency between March
1 and July 1 of the current fiscal year, leaving
only $180,000,000 in the cash balance on July
1 next, ot which $150,000,000 is in gold that
ought to remain in tne reserve and not be
us d to pay current expenses. This would
leave only $30,000,000 us the worm ng baiancj
next July, which is as smÂ«ll as safety permits.
The customs revenue under the act of 1890
for the fir-t fu! fiscal year of its operation
was $177 000,000. and for the second fiscal
year (1893) w<>s $203,000,000, with raw sugar
on tne free list. In October, 1892, before it
was known that radical reducaons of duties
were to be made, the then Secretary of ihu
Treasury isttmated t'nnt the customs revenue
lor the fiscal year 1894 would be $220,000,-
OUO, on tne basis of the gradually inciea&ing
â  receipts up lo that time. .But in January,
1894, he informed the Committee ou Ways
and Means that the anticipation of a tariff
with jower duties would inevitably postpone
importations and dimmish the revenue by
anticipation, as we'l as injuriously affect
business. This notwithstanding the tariff of
1890 remained ou the statute books duriug
July, 1884, yet the lact that during Mat year
a lower tarift" was expec.ed several months
before it was finally enacted, united with the
arrest of industries and consequent reduction
of ti.e consuming power of our people, caused
a postponement or abandonment of lmporta
tioLS to a large extent and thus partially nul
lified the tariff of IS9O long before Us actual
repeal.
The customs revenue for the fiscal year 1895,
ten months of winch was under the act of
1894, was raised to $152,000,000 by deferred
importations and the restoiation of the duty
en sugar, and in the fiscal year 1896 to $156,
--000,000, oi which nearly $30,000,000 was
from sugar that bad been placed ou the ftee
list by the tariff of 1890.
The customs reserve under the present tariff
for the fiscal year that wll clote June 30
next was estimated by Secretary Carlisle in hie
last annual report at $140,000,000, and
would have fal. en short of that, amount If it
had not been for importations and with
drawals from boud in order to avoid the an
ticipated revision of the tariff, and in tins re
port Secretary Carlisle estimated the revenue
from the custom receipts from tile fiscal year
thai will begin July 1 next at on.y $10,
--000,000.
It will be seen that while the revenue from
internal taxes has been well maintained the
annual revenue from duties ou import! had
declined over $60,000,000 since 1893 and
nearly $80,000,000 compared witu what
Secretary Foster tstimated in October, 1892,
would be the revenue iv 1894 under the inr.ff
o! 1890 on the basis of the increasing receipis
for the year previous and then existing condi
tionsâ coi.di ions which were revolutionized
by the result of the National election a snort
time after this estimate was mane, as already
explained.
If the customs revenue had continued to
gradually rise after the opening of 1893, as it
had before, or even if it had maintained the
figures of the fiscal year 1893, the revenue
would have been ample to meet all expendi
tures and the Government would have been
spared ihe necessity, not to say the humilia
tion, ol issuing bonds to meet the deficiencies
of current expenditures in time of peace.
The plain duty therefore of Congressâ a
duty emphasized by the President's message
laid before the House on the opening day of
this extraordinary sessionâ is to revise the
tariff, no as to secure a revenue from dutkn
substantially equal to wliat has been lost;
first, by the anticipated, and then by the par
tialiy realized tariff reductions made by the
act of 1894.
Anotuer imperative duty resting on this
Congress is to so adjust duties in such a re
vision oi the tana 10 secure needed revenue 10
carry on ttie Government as will better pro
toct the many industries which have so geri
ousiy suffered the past three years from un
equal loreign competition and consequent
l'>.-s of purchasing power of the masses ot the
people, upon which the demand fur products
and prosperity of every citizen depends.
The wool aud woolen schedule in this bill is
substantially that of the taiitt'of 1890, except
that a few kinds of wool classed under that
and previous actsâ as carpet wools, which
have been iargeiy used for clothing purposes,
and whoso use for a purpose not Intended by
the old classification nas caused much irrita
tion among wool-growersâ have been trans
ferred irom third-clan's to nr.st-cmss woois;
and the exclusively ad valorem duties which
have previously given the manufacturer a
protection against his foreign competitor em
ploying cheaper labor, and which enabled the
latter by undervaluation of the wide variety
of Imported woolens, whose value could not
be definitely determined, to avoid a large pan
of the duty appearing on the face of the tariff,
have been converted as largely as possible into
specifics equivalent to whatever the present
law professes to give.
We believe mat the enactment of this
schedule into law will not only restore to our
farmers the wool-growing industry which has
been so seriously injured by iree wool, our
flocks having diminisued more than a fourth
since 1892, but will also revive the wool
manufacturing industry which has been so
crippled by the tariff of 1891 and the loss of
the purchasing power ol the masses of our
people through lack of employment and will
at the same time largely increase she revenue
from that source, which, because of the char
acter of the line goods imported under the
tariff of 1890, was partially derived from
luxuries.
We have increased the duty on sugar from
the 40 per cent ad valorem imposed by the
present tariff on raw sugars (vow only nine
tenths of 1 per cent per pound on raw sugars
polarizing 90 degrees) on account of the de
cline of the .sugars, although about 1% cenm
when the wr.ff was enacted :n 1894. to 1.63
cents with a countervailing duty ou all sugars
equivalent to the net export bounty paid In
any country, in order to increase our revenue
and at the same time afford sufficient protec
tion to enable our farmers and planters to
-ultimately produce whatever sugar we may
require for consumption. The production of
cane sugar is large and, under proper protec
tion, a growing industry now.
The production of beet sugar m at leaÂ»t
twenty-three States of our Union, which only
seven years ago was regarded as of doubtful
promise, is no longer an experimen-t but a
demonstrated success with such protection
as we recommend, which is less tlian those
bounties given at the inception of sucar pro
duction by Germany, France and other Euro
pean countries.whica now produce about two
thirds of the world's sugar. . ,
The time has come when every effort should
be made to open up new crops to our farmers
and thus diversify and promote our agricul
tural interests, and no crop ia sight affords
more hope of success or greater good to the
whole country.
Even at the low prices of sugar, we paid In
the last fiscal year to foreign countries about
seventy-three millions for our raw sugar, in
addition to over $11 000,000 paid to the fcand
wich Islands for sugars imported free of duty
under our treaty oi reciprocity witn that coiir.
try. and in the near future that sum will nse
to one hundred millions. â ,â
lo open up such a new and valuable crop to
onr armers, who are finding tbe competition
<-f Russia and Argentine wheat a serious draw
back, is a boon which Congress siiould not
hesitate to give, especielly at a time when it
can be done in the interest of revenue.
In revising the severid dutiable schedules as
a rule the duties have bÂ»en fixed at points be
tween the tariff of 1800 aud the present tariff,
it having been lound that, on account ot
changed conditions in a large part <>f the ar
ticle?, duties lower than thos.; of 1890 would
be equally protective. The metal and cottou
schedules are in large part thp same as in the
present tariff", the increases above those rates
Deinglnthe more advanced articles. Manu
factured lumb'r, which was put on the lree
list by the tariff of 1804, has been transferred
to tho dutiable list as an act of justice to this
large industry and in the interest of revenue,
with little change in duties except on white
pine, which has been restored to the duty of
1883.
me President is authorized to negotiate
with the countries exporting argols, chicle,
champagne, brandy, sugar, wines, mineral
waters, paintings and statuary und siU laces,
with a view to secure reciprocity and equiv
alent concessions in tnvor of the products or
manufactures ot the United States.
It is bel.eved that this extension of the je
ciprocity po icy of the tariff of 1890, stength
ened by the teuders of lower duties as a cod
cession in return ior equivalent concession
will result in even more commercial advant
ages than those that were received under the
act of 1890
On the assumption that the imports under
the proposed tariff bill, if enacted into law,
would be the same as the imp >rts in the fis
cÂ»l year ended June 30, 1896, the revenue
which tne several scnedules oi the new bill
will yield, if it sliou d be enacted into law,
compired with tho revenues obtained under
the present tariff of 1896 and also compared
with the revenue yielded by the tariff of 1890,
fiscal rear 1 893, would tie substantial iy a total
vi an increase of #1 13,479,793,
This rouiih i Miniate on the basis oi ihe im
ports for 1896 shows that the revenue wotiid,
on such an assumption, be about $113 000,000
more than under the act ot 1894. What the
actual revenue would prove to bt in tne year
following the cnacimeut of the proposed
measure into law is, of course, dependent
upon contingencies which cannot be fore-
CHSted with any approach to certainty, and
will therefore be subjected to varying esti
mates.
It is probable that any delay beyond the Ist
of May would result in h loss of from one to
two millions of revenue for eacn week ol de
lay. It the proposed tariff revision could be
enacted into law by the sth of April undoubt
edly the revenue ol the hrst year under itÂ» op
eration would be from twenty to twenty-five
millions ler^er than it would be if its passage
was delayed until the l^t of July.
If it should become a law by May it Is more
than probable that it would yie.d an increase
of revenue of near.y $20,000,000 from sugar,
$30,000,000 from wool. $14,000,000 from
manufactures of wool (u.ssuuiing that the im
ports ot each would oe one-halt wbat they
were in 1896), $1,500,000 from lumber,
$3,000,000 from tobacco (a s sumina tliat thf
revolution in Cuba will continue). $1,800,000
from si'.k manufactures, $.!, 000,000 from
metals. $3,000,000 from glassware and earth
enwan-, $4,000,000 from clieinicnls (including
argois and opium transferred from the free
Us;). $5,000,000 from jute aud flax (including
burlaps and ba^s transferred ironi the free
list), $3,000,000 fr .m agricultural products
ana fruiis, #1 500,000 from liquors, $1,500,000
from silKs, $5,000,000 irom sundries(iuiiuding
articles trausiened irom the free liM)> $1,500,
--000 from cotton laces and other fine cntton
goods and yarns, or a total of $75,000,000.
It is easy to see how a delay ia the enact
ment of the bill to July 1, for exnmpie, would
easily take from the treasury $15,000,000 of
revenue and turn it into the pockets of specu
la tors importing wooi, woolen goods, sugiir
and other articles on which it is proposed to
increase the revenue, and at the same time
deprive wool-growers Â«iid producers and manu
facturers of the Deneflt \hat would arise iroin
the prompt passage ol the bill proposed.

course of the day's debates recalled the
palmy days of the Fifty-first and Fifty
second Coneresses, while besides these not
unexpected differences of opinion as to
action and policy there was ill-concealed
animosity between the two factions of the
Democratic minority growing out of the
race for leadership of that party on the
floor.
If to-day's proceedings mey be taken as
in any way typical of the work of the
House the session will take rank with the
most tumultuous that have marked its
history. The ball was opened promptly
upon assembling in the presence of crowd
ed galleries.
Dingley (R.)of Maine returned toe tariff
bill with the recommendation that it do
pass, which, with the accompanying re*
port, was placed on the calendar.
In connection with this McMiliin (D.)
of Tenness c called attention to what he
termed tbe "colossal injustice" done the
minority of the Committee on Ways and
Means in thus reporting the bill before
they had had time to prepare an expres
sion of their views. Conbent was given
for the minority to file their views Mon
day.
This having been done, Dalzeli (R.)ot
Pennsylvania presented a resolution from
the Committee on Rules providing for
the consideration of the tariff bill. It
called lor general debate, beginning on
Monday next amlJinciudinK Thursaay, the
25tn inst., from 10 a. m. until 11 p. m., with
v recess from 5 uatil 8. Then for its con
sideration under tne live-minute rule, the
bill to be open lor amendment until 3
p. m. Wednesday, the 31st., when the vot
ing on tba amendments and bill shall
begin.
This was advocated by Dalzeli (R.) of
Pennsylvania and Dingiey (R.) of Maine
and opposed by McMil.in (D ) of Tennes
see, B and (D.) of Missouriâ whose rising
was the signal for rapturous applause by
his Democratic associatesâ Wheeler (D. )
of Alabama and Bailey (D.) of Texas.
There was mucti crossriring in this dis
cussion, a coiloquy between Grosvenor
(R.) of Onio and McMiliin (D.) of Tennes
teÂ« affording great satisfaction to their re
spective partisans.
The resolution was agreed t0â 179 to
132â a party vote, save that Howard (Pop.)
ot Alabama voted in the affirmative witu
the Republicans.
This being settled, Hanson (R.) of lowa
reported a resolution providing for the
passage of the appropriation bills which
failed at the last session of Congress in
this order: The sundry- civil, general de
ficiency, agricultural and Indian. The
resolution allowed forty minutes' debate
on each bill, the bills to be read in ex
ten so.
Tiie preliminary discussion of this reso
lution was pamcipated in by McMillin
(D.) of Tennessee and Sayers (D ) of Texas,
who liad a rather heated controversy over
tne matter of controlling the time in op
position to the resolution.
In conclusion, Sayers suggested that
McMillin would do better to Keep cool, to
wmch McMillin said: "The gentleman
from Tennessee will keep cool and the
gentleman irom Texas cannot besrt him."
The resolution was adopted after an
hour's discussion â 137 to 116â Pearson and
Linney (R.) of North Carolina voting
against their political associates, who sup
ported the resolution.
The demand fora vote by ayes and noes
brought out a hot protest from Hender
son (K.) of lo'va, who charged that it was
a violation of the agreement wifi Bailey
(D.)of Texas and McMillin (D.) of Ten
nessee, thai 90 dilatory motion would be
made.
They denied making any such Droraise,
but the atmosphere was quite heated in
consequence ol their action.
At Mr. Cannon's urgent solicitation the
House remained in session until a late
hour and passed ttie sundry civil and gen
eral deficiency bills, leaving the agricul
tural and Indian bills to be disposed of
to-morrow.
SKSJ.TE BWuLMPHU WITH SILLS.
About m ihounand, Holdover* Introduced
in the Senate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 19. -
When the Senate met to-day the number
of bills that had been introduced during
the ihree days of the extraordinary ses
sion was 768; when it adjournedâ after
about an hour's public sfssion â the num
ber had been run up to 955. Almost all of
them had been introduced in the last and
former Congress.
A petition of John Edward Addicks,
contesting the election of Senator Kcnney
ol Delaware and claiming that he waa
himself duly elected, was presented and
referred to the Committee on Privileges
and Elections, as wae also a communica
tion from the Governor and Secretary of
State of Oregon asserting there liad been
no regularly organized session of the Slate
Legislature since February, 1895. and
leaving it to be implied that, the appoint
ment of Mr. Corbett by the Governor was
regular and constitutional.
The Senate went into executive session
on the arbitration treaty at 12:50, and at 4
p. m. adjourned until Monday.
CHARGES GROSS FRAUDS.
How Constitutional Amendments Are Car
ried in Nebraska â Thousands of
Crocked Ballots.
LINCOLN, Nebr., March 19.-P. E. Hed
lund, the Republican member of the re
canvass commission, has wr.Uten a letter
to Governor Holcomb in which he makes
charges of the grossest frauds by other
members of the commission in connection
with the recount, which has been progress
ing unstopped by a court injunction last
Wednesday. A let.er was sent to the
Governor at 11 o'clock last night and its
contents made public to-day. Mr. Hed
lund detail* the part be took in the re
count (that of teller) and proceeds:
It is within my observation, and I speak
from actual knowledge, that thousands of
blank ballots which were voted neither yes
nor no tor constitutional amendments have
beeu counted "yes" by the said board of can
vassers and hundreds of ballots that were
voted "no" by tne voters of the State weie
counted "yes/ 1 In Â«ome places a single ballot
haÂ« been counted "yeÂ»' as many as ten or a
doz'-p times. >
On an average of every ten votes counted
for the amendment at least two were not cast
fcr the amendment, but were fraudulently
counted. I unhesitatingly assert that this
fraudulent count of ballots has been made in
all of the forty-one counties so far couuteu.
In some of these c"untieÂ» tne vote for tne
amendment hu& been thus fraudulently in
creased -is much as 400 votes.
I make this report to you at the present time
becauio I fear the evidence of these frauds
may be spirited aÂ«ay or destroyed. If these
ballots are not tampered with and the tally
lists can be preserved it will bo fouud upon an
examination of tho ballots tnat my state
men is and assertions are absolutely true.
Mr. Hedlund has the reputation of be
ing conservative, and bis integrity has
never been questioned. He was Deputy
State Auditor for four years and thÂ« de
feated Repub ican candidate for Auditor.
Governor Holcomb this evening took offi
cial notice of tbe letter by relieving Hed
lund from tbo committee, at the same
time criticising him for not at once re
porting his charges. The other rive
members of me committee join in a
letter denouncing Hedlund'a charges as
false and courting investigation. The af
fair has caused a decided sensation.

PASSES THE BILL
Finish of a Close Contest in
the Senate on Coyote-
Scalp Claims.
There Being a Tie, the Lieu
tecaot-Governor Decides
With an "Aye."
Bui Morehouse Questions iho Right
of the Presiding Oificer, and a
Lawiuit Mar Easue.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 19.â One
of tbe closest and most interesting con
tests of the session occurred in trie Senate
to-day over the coyote scalp bill, appro
priating $257,615 for the payment of coyote
scalp claims.
After a long and warm debate at the
rnorjune se^ston, it was lost by one vote.
At the afternoon session it was decided to
reconsider it, and the vote on the final
passage, after a call of the House, which
brought every member into the chamber,
resulted in a tie. President Jeter asked
time for a careful perusal of the measure,
and then voted in the affirmative, thus
sending the Dili to the Governor, who, it
is understood, will sign it. When Jeter
announced his decision, many of tbe
members could scarcely restrain their de
sire to applaud.
When the measure was reached on tbe
file, Bulla opposed its passage, stating it
as his belief tt:at a lare:e portion of" the
claims were fraudulent, and that the
Board of Examiners had no riebt to go
into the question of determining which
were just and which were fraudulent.
Simpson claimed that the State was un
der contract to settle these claims and
that it would be to its discredit to re
pudiate tbem by refusing to pass the bill.
He admitted that many of the claims
might be fraudulent, but he thought most
of them were genuine.
Pedlar said that in bis section of the
State (Fresno) there were a large number
of claims held by farmers, who had acted
i i goo i faith in aiding to rid the State of
the pests.
Jones, Langford and spoke
in. favor of the bill. Boyce and Stratton
orposed it.
. Smith advocated its passage and asserted
that a large majority of the claims from
Kern County were held by individuals,
most of them poor people, in sums rang
ing from $5 to $1.5. He had full confi
dence in the ability and power of the
Board ot Examiners to segregate the good
from the bad claims, and hoped the bill
would pass.
The rollcall showed 20 ayes and 15 noes.
This was one short ot tne necessary num
ber to pass the measure. Withington
changed from aye to no and save notice
of reconsideration.
After the noon recess Ywthington moved
lor a reconsideration or the bill. He
called anrntiou 10 the report of the Board
of Examiners, which recommended the
appropriation, and which, he Baid, threw
every safeguard nround the measure to
prevent fraudulent claim* beins paid.
Tiie motion to reco:ijider was adopted
by a vote of 23 ayes to 17 noes.
Wolfe spoke against the measure, and
- the rollcall on the tinal passage of the
Jaill resulted i;i a ti" vote aÂ« follows:
Androu?, Aram, Beard, Chapman, Deni
tOTif D.cKinson, Doty, Flint, Franck,
GJeaves, Holloway, JoneÂ«, Langford, Lin
der, Peillar, Shine, Shippee, Simpson,
Broitb, With. ngtonâ Total, 20 ayes.
HBert, Boycr, Braunhart, Bulla, Dwyer,
Feencjr, Giiiette, Hall, Henderson, La
RuÂ» L'ichsinger, Mahoney, Morehouse,
Prislc, Seawd 1 , Stratton, Tower, Trout,
Vnorheis, Wolfeâ Total, 20 noes.
L'eusenant-Governor Jeter, after a brief
consultation with the secretary, remarked,
â¢â¢The vote seems to be a tie."
Senutor Smith called for the decision of
the chair.
President Jeter answered : "I would ask
the indulgence of the Senate for a little
while. The chair has paid but little at
, tension to tbe bill and would like time to
read it. Ido not Know just what its pro
' visions are."
He perused the bill for several minutes
a:ui then Â«poke as follows, every word
being listened to with almost breathless
expectancy:
"I was not present when the debate oc
curred on this bill during the morning
session, and should iike to ask for in
formation as to whether the claims that
would be covered by the amount of this
appropriation have been passed upon by
the Board of Examiners."
Withington, risincr with a copy of the
board's report in his hand, read there
from as follow?:
â¢T c Board of L,jÂ»iuiners report that
the number of nn'*al<l scalps for which
certificates have bet:, issued is 57,523. ag
gregating the sum of $287,615. The board
respectfully recommends that an appro
priation be made to pay these claims."
Wiihinuton added: "This bill was also
drawn by the Board of Examiners."
"It was also provided," asked President
Jeter, "that the claims must further be
X>assed upon by the Board of Examiners?"
Smith was jicomptly to the rescue.
"There can be no question about that.
The language of the bill is emphatic."
Then came the momentous decision of
the chair. "In vie* of the facts con
nected with this bill," he said, "I suppose
the chair may be permitted to explain, as
well as the members on this floor. Assum
ing that the State Board of Examiners has
recommended this appropriation and has
provided for an investigation of these
claims, and further understanding and
appreciating i.he State's obligation to pay
all just claims, the chair will vote aye. I
will farther state that I think it is a bill
that should go to the Governor."
Morehoiise made the point that all Dills
must receive a majority of the votes of all
duly elected members of each house, and
questioned the chair's right 10 caÂ»t the
deciding vote on a measure of this kind.
â  Simpson declared that the President
had the right to decide under the circum
stances.
Jeter quietly put an ecd to further con
troversy by remarking: "Some other
tribunal will have to pass on that ques
tion."
It is stated that the Supreme Court has
in a number of similar cases upheld the
course taken by Presi-ient Jeter.

deavcrett to reach Henry French bj sub
pen* duly issued, commanding his pres
ence before your committee, but we were
unable to secure his attendance until a
late hour on March 18, 1897.
"While Mr. French emphatically denies
any improper intention to unduly 'block*
legislation on Senate bill 494 and ascribes
but the finest of motives in his desire to
secure good legislation in its defeat, and
while such may have been the cr.se, yet to
prevent any future attempt we recommend
that legislative enactment by forthwith
adopting such measures to adequately
punish any unseemly interference with
legislative proceedings.
"We are amply justified in reporting to
you our conclusion that the errors which
crept into the enrolled bill are not due to
any act of any officer of the Assembly,
and particularly as to John Varcoe, en
rolling cleric of the Assembly, who was
mentioned in the Governor's message, and
upon investigation found that he did not
even handle tbe said Senate bill 494 and
was in no way connected therewith.
"Finding that the errors occurred in tbe
Senate we have not felt authorized to pur
sue them to an ultimate conclusion. We
merely state, however, that the enrolling
clerk of the Senate claims that the errors
were due to the fact that amendments
were attached to the bill, with nothing on
their face to indicate that they bad been
receded from. This is true. The history
of the bill, as contained on the cover,
shows that the amendments bad been re
ceded from. Wa report the above facts,
not as intimating any conclu-ion of ours,
for it is not within our province, but sim
ply as circumstances under which it is
claimed the errors were made. We recom
mend in this respect that hereafter, when
ever an amendment is receded from,
it be so stamped upon its face."
The report was adopted and another
fake charge was laid in the wastebasket.

TELEGRAM* BOXED UP.
And Aotr There 1* a Struggle for Their
Foateision.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. March 19.â The
Assembly committee investigated the Ex
aminer coyote fake all day and had Mann
ger George Senf of the Western Union
otlice at Sacramento on the stand. Mr.
Senf declined to allow the dragnet to be
cast in his office, and be was brought be
fore the bar of the House, where he pro
duced the following:
George, Scvf, Manager of the Wextern Union
Telegraph Companyâ Yea; you can answer thai
you had a conversation with me in regard to
the messages; that you turned them over to
me this morning and ttiat they are no longer
to your possession. Keep me advised of ihe
situation. K. Jaynes.
Mr. f-'enf said that at Mr. Jaynes' re
quest, he had boxed up all political tele
grams passing through his office since
Alarch 5. and had shipped them to Mr.
Jaynes. He declined to state the point of
shipment.
Felix Tracy, agent of Wells-Fargo Ex
press Company, was sworn and showed a
way bill which disclosed the fact .hat the
box of telegrams nad been shipped from
here at 11 o'clock this morninu to Mr.
Javnes at Reno.
Mr. Tracy refused to order the box bade
without consulting his attorney. Manager
Senf refused to authorize Mr. Tracy to stop
the box before it jjot out of the State.
Mr. Tracy subsequently changed his
mind and Â«ent for the box. Liter, a dis
patch was received to the eff-ct that the
dqx had been stopoed at Truckee, and
would b* here to-morrow morning.
To-night Judjje R. B. Carpenter, attor
ney for tue telegraph company, arrived
with a writ of replevin to iÂ»reveiit the box
from being taken out of the possession of
the company.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 20, 1897.
SOME WHOLESOME
LAWS ARE MADE
Imoortant Measures Passed
Upon by the State
Legislature.
Closing Work of the Session
That Passes Into History
at Noon To-Day.
Courage and Intelligence Were Dis
play d, No withstanding the
Hearst Mud-S inking.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 19.â Few
Legislatures of this State have to their
credit the amount of wise and important
legislation that has been enacted by the
sitting body which will go into history at
noon to-morrow. To this affirmative dis
tinction it can also add the negative honor
of having passed little or no vicious legis
lation and of having been remarkably free
from il cinch" or blackmail bills. It will
also go down in history as the body which
bad tue courage and intelligence to ex
pose and hold up to public odium tbe
journal which, in the interest of politics,
sought by unfounded charges of corrup
tion to cast a stigma upon it, s?mply be
cause the people preferred to trust their
public affairs to Republicans. The only
result of its frantic and stupid efforts was
to cause it to be publicly and officially
branded as a willful falsifier and to be
popularly designated as tbe "new journal
of a thousand and one fakes."
That all legislation passed was intelli
gently and thoroughly considered is
shown by the fact that out of more than
1800 measures introduced in both houses
only about 120 have become laws, or about
7 per cent
To Senator Stratton belongs the honor
of authority of several of the most impor
tant and far-reaching laws. First in the
list is his constitutional amendment pro
viding for home rule for counties. This
not only does away with the county govern
ment act and the county fee bill, but gives
each county the right to make its own
election law>. Another notable measure
introduced by him is a new primary elec
tion law, which greatly simplifies and
lessens the costs of such elections. He is
also the author ot the bill which provides
that in cases on appeal there shall be no
reversals on technicalities. This is con
sidered one of the mast desirable amend
ments to the Code of Civil Procedure that
could have been made and has the almost
universal approval of the bar and bench
of the State.
Not less in value to the people of the
State is the bill fathered by Senator Bulla
for the certification of land titles and the
simplification of the transfer of real estate,
popularly known ai the Torrens lasi i bill.
This provides that alter proper examina
tion by a court of record a certificate of
title shall be issued which shall be inde
fensible. In this way a piece of real estate
can be transferred as readily as a horse or
any kind of personal property. This
measure had a checkered history before it
became a law. It was defeated in the
Senate by lobbyists working In the inter
est of tide insurance companies. But its.
author secured a reconsideration and after
j an able speech in favor of the Dill and in
I denunciation of the principal lobbyist
I ag-unst the measure secured its passage by
a good majority.
Three measures of special interest to
San Francisco safely passed the acyila
i and charyb.lis of legislation. T ese were
j Assemblyman Treacy's bills providing for
| a Juliy paid Fire Department for San
Francisco, Hall's bill for a free public
market on the water front of San Fran
cisco, and Braunhart's bill for the exten
tension of the seawall south of Mission
j street and the issuance of $1,000,000 worth
of bonds therefor.
To those interested in the higher educa
tion cause for gratification in the work
of the Legislature will be found in As
semblyman Wright's bill, which gives
the State University the revenue from
a 2-cent tax hereaftor. Inis will ena
ble that institution to provide better
accommodations for the students and
more instructors, and will also permit to
1Â»7 up a fund for the construction and
maintenance of larger and more appro*
priate buildings in the future.
Another bill in favor of education ia
that which reappropriated $125,000 for
buildings for the affiliated colleges to be
erected in San Francisco.
Miners see hope and life in the bill
which reapprooriates $250,000 for the im
pounding of debris, and the farmers of the
Sacramento Valley find equal food for
congratulation in the passage of the
dredger billl. In fact these two measures
are expectea to prove of equal benefit to
both miner and farmer as they will per
mit each to carry on his respective indus
try without interfering with the other.
In the passage of the coyote scalp
claims bill has been removed one of the
stumbling blocks of legUlation in this and
the preceding session. This has been the
source of more scandalous stories than
any measure for many a session. While
it is known by every member that there
are numerous lraudulent coyote claims
pending, it is con6dently expected that
they will be weeded out by the Board of
Examiners.
1 1 was deemed best to pass the bill ap
propria;ing $287,(i15 for the payment of
these claims, so as to permit all honest
claimants, more particularly the farmers,
wJiose individual claims are small, to re
ceive what is due them. Had the bill not
passed at this session it was feared that
tne smaller holders of coyote claims would
be forced to sell at a heavy discount to the
speculators, and that ia t. is way the
temptation to lobbyists would be in
creased.
What may be justly placed in the cate
gory of measures of the first importance
is the change of venue bill, known as
Bridgford's Assembly bill 977, and which
was subsiituted for the celebrated Cami
netti Assembly bill 'J73, which incidentally
landed two of the Examiner's staff in jail
for faking and then refusing to confess.
Lovers of the wheel played even on the
Southern Pacinc for attempting to charge
for carrying; wheels across the ferry by
securing the passage of a bill providing
for the carriage of bicycles as baggage
everywhere in the State.
Senator Dickinson, in bis dairy inspec
tion bill, has given the people of the state
the opportuniiy to secure absolutely pure
and healthful milk and other dairy
products.
1Â» provides for the inspection of all cat
tle and particularly for the detection and
extirpation of bovine tuberculosis. It
calls for tne :: Ming of all infected cattle
and permits Lie loss for the same to fall
on the unfortunate owner. As originally
introduced it provided that tht State
should compensate the owner for all his
infected cattle that were condemned and
slain.
These are a few of the most meritorious
measures out of scores of others. But if
credit is due for the new laws given tbe
people, equal commendation is due for
the vast number of bills that were con
signed to oblivion.
Object to tiohen and Kinnxy.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 19.â At
the caucus of the Republican Senators to
day it was decided to request he Governor
to withdraw the nomination of George T.
Bohen for appointment as Pilot Com
missioner of San Francisco, vice Jobn
Hackett. removci, and also the nomina
tion of Abbott Kinney for appointment as
trustee of the "Whittier School, to succeed
Trustee Patterson, term expired..
The objection to the confirmation of
Bohen is ba-ed on constitutional grounds,
it being claimed that Hackett, having
been appointed for four yearj by Governor
Budd two years aero, could not be removed
without cause. The opposition to Kin
ney is based on personal grounds. It is
stated that the Governor will name either
Harry W. P.^tton or As&emblynian Meade
as Patterson's successor.

PALMER FOR PUBLIC PRINTER.
Ex-President Harrison Secures the Ap
pointment of the Man Who Served
Under His Administration.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 19.-Ex-
President Harrison, when he calleJ upon
President McKinley on Wednesday, said
to him:
"Mr. President, I have one request to
make of you, and one only, and it is that
you appoint as Public Printer Mr. Palmer
of Illinois, who served in that capacity
during my administration."
President McKinley assured General
Harrison that his request would be
granted, so it is certain that Palmer will
succeed Public Printer Benedict as soon
as the latter's term has expired, and per
haps sooner.
The Call correspondent received posi
tive information to-night that Harrison
had made this request of McKiniey, and
that it had been granted. Furthermore,
it has been decided to try and rescind the
order which placed all of the subordinate
positions in the Government Printing
Office under the civil service. It will be
urged as an excuse that the Public Printer
has violated both the letter and the spirit
of the civil service law, having in one day
discharged 700 employes upon the plea of
economy. It is aileeed that a vast ma
jority of them were Republicans, and that
soon afterward Mr. Benedict lound it
necessary to increase the force of em
ployes to what it was before the reduc
tion, and that a large majority of the new
appointees were Democrats.
This is claimed to be a gross violation
of the civil service act. if is understood,
that the joint Committee on Printing in
Congress will investigate and recommend
that President McKinley rescind the ex
ecutive order of his predecessor, Mr. Cleve
land, which embraced the Government
printing office in the civil service. It is
considered doubtful, however, whether
the President has power to revoke this
executive order without action of Con
gress.
ARBITRATION HOW POSSIBLE.
The tropoMed Treaty tt'tth Great Britain
It Orrrhauled.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 19â The
Senate this alternoon in executive session
spent three hours in discussing the arbi
tration treaty. Senator Davis, chairman
of the Committee on Foreign Relations,
first addressed the Senate. Davis said
that the treaty as sent to the Senate by
Secretary Olney could not have had his
approval, and he w;is quite certain that in
that shape it could not have received a
single vote in the committee, and possibly
could not have resoived more than a dozen
in the whole Senate.
The scope of the treaty had not been in
terfered with, but in the consideration of
its administrative features the committee
had amended it so as to safeguard it
against any possible loophole that might
operate to the disadvantage of this coun
try. King Oocar. as tbe umpire, had ben
eliminated because it was believed there
was no need for the designation in the in
strument itself of any one to act in this
capacity.
With reference to the stipulation
that members of the Supreme Court
should sit as members of this tribunal,
Senator Davis said they were very hard
worked, and the committee had come to
the conclusion that it was unnecessary to
burden them with this additional duty.
For that reason the desienation of mem
bers of the Supreme Court had been
stricken out and the provision ordered to
read that jurists of repute, without men
tioning any court, should be appointed by
and with the advice and consent of the
Senate.
Davis was followed by Stewart, who
antagonized the idea of entering into any
kind of a treaty with Great Britain, a
country which he characterized as the
biggest land-grabber on the face of the
earth.
Turpie of Indiana spoke briefly in favor
of the treaty as amended. The conven
tion will be called up by Davis again the
first of the week.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 19.â One
of the most faithful representatives of the
people on the floor of the Apsernbly this
session is Hon. George H. Uurnham of
the historic old county of El Dorado. He
has been a hard worker. Although a
member of four of the hardest committees
connected with the Legislature and an in
terested attendant upon the meetings of
those committees, he has always been
round in his seat at roilcall and no im
portant measure has escaped his careful
scrutiny and industrious attention.
Burnham is the chairman of the im
portant Committee on County and Town
ship Governriients and is a member of the
committees on Mines and Mining Inter
ests, Counties and County Boundaries,
and Commissions, Retrenchment and
Public Expenditures.
"Oh, this is nothing," said ho, as he
affixed his signature to the last of a bunch
of type-written letters in reply to inquiries
relative to the county government act.
"If 1 have had to make reply to one letter
relative to this mil I've had to answer a
hundred or more. As chairman of the
County and Township Government Com
mittee I am supposed to know all about
the purport oi every one of the amend
ments proposed and adopted to this
measure. It has been one of the most im
portant bills of the session. It affects the
local governments of trie whole State and
has, of course, required a great deal of
consideration in the committee, and the
most careful attention on the part of the
House. I assure you lam glad it has pro
greased to its third reading and that the
work of the committee' on that measure is
at an end, for it has been a corker.
"Being from a county in which mining
is the most important industry, I, of
course, have taken a lively interest in the
Committee on Mines and Mining Inter
ests. My people have stood in need of
some legislation for the mines, and I am
glad I have had the opportunity to be of
service to them by being a member of the
mining; committee. We have had a num
ber of important bills before that commit
tee. One of the most notable and, I be
lieve, one of the best of the bills in which
Assemblyman G:o. H. Bumham.
the miner? are interested is the Assembly
measure placing the quarter of a million
dollars appropriated contingently by the
last Legislature for the purpose of con
structing, in conjunction with the Na
tional Government, certain dams that
will permit the development of the min
ing interests of the northern part of the
State, The use of this appropriation will
do more lor this all-importnnt industry
than all the legislation in years. I am
glad to see there is a trend In legislation
toward the miner and his interests, and I
am clad I hay been a member of this
Legislature, insomucn that it gave me art
opportunity vote and work for these peo
ple.
"I have been specially interested, how
ever, in securing for my county an appro
priation for tne proper care of a newly
acquired property of the State, the rond
from Smiths Flat, in my county, over the
mountains to Lake Tahofi and the Nevada
State line. This is an admirable piece of
property and is traveled every summer by
hundreds of campers in wagon outfits
from all parts of the State. Tne route is
most picturesque, and my bill, No. 402,
was introduced with the object of getting
tne State to take care of this valuable
property. I have had a great measure of
success with this, my pet bill, and that is,
of conrse, another matter of sell-congratu
lation." r

NOW WITHOUT A RIVAL!
No Remedy to Compare With Paine's
Celery Compound,
Read the Really Wonderful Experi=
ence of Rev. Dr. Bailey and His
Good Wife, and the Indorsements
of Other Eminent Divines.
Here is a letter from the pastor of the
most influential church in Sooth Balti-
more, that every truth-seeker should read
carefully.
Every disheartened sick person and
every man or woman who has lost faith in
the remedies he or she has tried because
none of them has done any poodâ every
one who is sick ought to be cheered up and
tilled with new hope and determination
by the letter written by Rev. William T.
Bailey, pastor of the Curtis Bay Church,
the most influential church in South Bal-
timore.
On March 31, 1896, the Baltimore Sun,
under display headlines, published the fol-
lowing news of Rev. Mr. Bailey's afflic-
tion :
"Rev. Wm. T. Bailey, pastor of the Cur-
tis Bay Baptist church, was paralyzed in
the tongue while preaching Sunday night,
and lost the power of speech. The cnn-
grecation was at once dismissed, ana Dr.
was called. He said Mr. Bailey was
suffering from a severe attack of nervous
prostration caused by hard study and
overwork, and that be must have rest and
quiet."
The whole city was shocke 1 . Tne papers
soon be an to record an improvement.
On April 13, 1896, the following open
letter was addressed to tne proprietors of
Paine's celery compound :
Boutr. Baltimore, Md.. April 13, 1896.
Messrs. Wells, Richardson & Co.,
Gentlemen : â I was taken very ill while
preaching Easter Sunday night. My doc-
tor could not help me, so I discharged
him and began to use Paine's celery com-
pound with crnshing effect. I will not
hesitate to say that it is the best medicine
in the world. I am, fraternally,
William T. Bailey.
Later in the year the proprietors of this
wonderful remedy received still anotner
letter from Dr. Bailey, as follows:
Gentlemen : â 1 propose to do what I can
to let people know of your Paine's celery
compound, the medicine that has done me
so much good. I shall in ray own way, in
speaking of my rapid and great improve-
ment from ihepulpit, give as is justly due,
tribute to Paine's celery compound. I
married, six years ago, MissLillio B. Dun-
navant, a lady well known in Â«ocial life,
niece of Capt. Robt F. Lewis, U. S. navy.
During the whole six years she has been
an invalid, suffering from hysteria, laugh-
ing, crying and screaming, so that she
could be heard for squares. I have had a
great deal of trouble and expense.

A few weeks ago there was published a
testimonial of the great virtue of Paine'i
relery compound from Rev. Charles L.
Tdompson, D. D.. LL.D.. the eminent
Presbyterian preacher of New York City.
Rev. Dr. Meek, editor of the Central
Methodist, recently wrote an open leiter,
telling that Paine's celery compound had
worked a remarkable cure in his case.
And last month the great temperance
evangelist, Francis Murphy, told the pub-
lic, how Paine's celery compound had been
a blessing in his family.
These are a few among thousands.
Every otic knows conscientious, (hari-
table persons who are too busy, more
often too procrastinating, to save their
health from going to p eces, and rird it
easier to help others than themselves.
Such persons fill up the army of broken-
down business men and sickly women.
Every one in this spring urae needs to
purify the blood and regulate the nerves.
Carry home to-day â not by-and-by â a
bottle of Paine's relery compound. Cure
nervousness, neuralgia and rheumatism
this spring. You can now put your health
on a sound basis by means of Paine's
celery compound.
Charity should now begin at home.
Attend to your own health and that ot
your family.
Paine's celery compound is within the
reach of every larai.y where there is ,i
member affl cted by any stomach, liver or
kidney trouble. It cures permanently
and rapidly.
It must be distinguished from all other
remedies.

EXCITING SCENES
IN THE ASSEMBLY
Great Rumpus Caused by
the Withdrawal of a
Cinch Bill.
Jones Goes After Caminetti and
Calls Him Down Very
Hard.
"Liar!" and Other Unparliamentary
Terms Used by an Enraged
Legislator.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 18.âAs
semblyman Jones of San Francicco went
on the warpath to-day and spoke hot,
sizzling words to Caminetti of Amador â
â words of war and defiance before which
the man from Amador shuddered and low
ered his colors.
It appeared that Jones last night stated
to the House that he had the consent of
Senator Androus to withdraw Senate bill
314, which be had introduced by the Sena
tor "by request." It is a railroad cinch bill
and practically requires all steam and street
railroads, ferry boat 3, passenger boats,
mule teams and all other transportation
companies to report the innermost details
of their business annually to the Board of
Railroad Commissioners. Assemblyman
Jones had it withdrawn.
Caminetti and some of his Democratic
friends were very much interested in se
curing the passage of the bill through the
House, and this morning the gentleman
from Amador demanded the return of the
bill to its place on the file. In making
the motion he stated that Senator Androus
had told him that he had not given Joues
his consent for the withdrawal of the bill.
After the bill had been placed on the hie
Jones, hot with anger, walked over to
C'aminettis desk and fiercely demanded
whether Caminetti had intended to charge
Jones with utterine a falsehood.
'No," replied Caminetti, "but Senator
Androus said that he had not given his
consent.'
"Senator Androus won't tell you that in
my presence, because he did consent."
Jonas tells the rest of the story as fol
lows: "Senator Androus introduced the
bill at the request of somebody else, and I
asked him whether I should withdraw it. j
He was perfectly satisfied that I should j
withdraw it. So I went over to Caminetti j
to find out if he intended to call me a liar.
If he did 1 intended to hit him square in I
the jaw. I told him thai it was one of the â 
most infamous bills, n cinch measure to j
keep out foreign capital from investing in :
street railroads or any other kind of rail
roads. I told Caminetti that only sack
hunters were in favor of the bill, and he
said: 'lam not a, sack-hunter.' I said, j
'The Examiner 3ays you are,' and I walked i
off. Of course I don't believe that Cam
inetti ever got a cent, but the Examiner
virtually said that he did take money, but
I don't believe it."
Immediately after this passage-at-arms
between Jones and the Democratic fili
buster the lunch recess was ordered and
the announcement was made that the
Democratic minority would bold a caucus j
by way of grace before meat. "About
that railroad bill," said Dibble, with a
laugh.
Dibble's guess was wiser than he knew.
The caucus was for the purpose of out
lining a plan of action for filibustering
and tne railroad bill was to be the main
spring of the movement. "Block legisla
tion" was the result of the caucus. The I
object of this agreement was to wind up
the last calls of the House, so that little
or no business might be done and so that
tbe session might en 1 in disorder and
scandal. This would give the Democrats
a little more thunder to use in the nest
campaign and would give the fake organ
of the Democracy a text to boast upon,
now that the last echoes of the coyote's
yelp is beard in the distance.
As soon as the Sacramento Bee made its
appearance in the House in the afternoon
Caminetti rose to a question of* personal
privilege and rea 1 the account of the
passage-at-arms between himself and
Jones. Caminetti worked himself up to a
fever heat. It was evident that be felt the
more or less powerful backing of the
Democratic caucus behind him. He had
submitted meekly a day or two ago to be
called down by even North of Yolo, but
tie was brave to-day against Jones. Shak
ing his fist at the gentleman from San
Francisco he accused him of Btating what
was not true.
Jor.es rose to reply, when Shanahan
mixed u;> in the contention. In the
course of his remarks the man from
Shasta said that the fact remained that
the bill was removed from the fiies by
trickery, deceit and fraud.
â¢â¢\ on are a liar," shouted Jones."
The House was instantly thrown into
Oonfusion. The galleries and lobbies
were crowded with the good people ,of
Sacramento, men and women, v.horn the
Examiner a short time ago denounced as
vestal virgins with down-turned thumbs
and as the offscourmg of society. In
stantly a hush settled down upon the
audience. Shanaban, swelling to the full
capacity of his luncs and reddening with
rage, shouted: "You are an infernal
Bcoundrel."
Jones, who had remained standing at
his desk, retorted with the most insulting
expression one man can use toward an
other: "Your are a !" he said
shaking his forefinger at Shanaban.
Speaker Coombs had been rapping for
order all this time and nearly every man
in the House was on the floor shouting
for points of order, while the Speaker's
gavel beat an almost deafening tattoo upon
bis <le?k. Others were calling for the
Speaker to order the remarks of the gen
tlemen taken down.
Robinson of Nevada County asked that
the epithet applied by Jones to Shanahan
should not be put on the record, and his
rrquest wa3 complied with. Then Clerk
Duckworth read the interesting dialogue.
"Mr. Speaker," said Shanahan, after
the clerk bad ceased reading, "I desire to
correct my statement to this extentâ l
said 'infamous scoundel' instead of 'in
fernal scoundrel.' "
Jones was shaking his clenched fist at
Shanahan and hurling words which could
not be heard in the hubbub. Speaker
Coombs declared that the hour of recess
had arrived and the members put on their
oats and stood arounrt the hall talking
aDOUt the exciting episode.
Price of Sonoma caueht Jones by tbe
right elbow and urced him not to assault
Bhanahan, but to keep cool. Members of
the baa francisco delegation crowded
around nim and advised him to take no
no:ice of Shanahan's worJs.
Shanahan and Caminetti were sur
rounded by their friends, and for a 1 briet
spell it looked as though there was going
to be a melee with revolvers and bowie
knives. Jones was wild, and remained iv
tlie room longer than most of the rest de
nouncing the bill as a cinch measure,
while Belshaw, the center of another
group, wa-3 making a speech in favor of the
bill. When they got hungry they went
out to dinner. At 7:30 the House
convened for the evening session, and the
first business in order came near being a
renewal of the row. Waymire of Ala
meda was the firebrand in the guise of a
meek and hol3* peacemaker. He offered
the following resolution:
Whereas, Messrs. Caminetii, Jones and Shan
aban ihis day iv open session of the Assembly
made use of language which is in the most
offensive sense unparliamentary mid grossly
insulting to the House; now, therefore, be H
Resolved, That they and eacn of them be re
quired to withdraw such language and apolo
gize to the House for the use of tha same.
"I move the adoption of the resolution,"
said Wayniire.
Denuery asked that action on tfie reso
lution be deferred. Probably the gentle
men themselves might have something to
say in the way of apology. He himself
was in favor of expunging the whole mat
ter from the record.
"Mr. Speaker," said Waymire, "I de
cline to withdraw the resolution. That
resolution proposes the most mild pun
ishment that could be inHtcted. The con
duct of those parties this day would just
ify their eipulsion. Never in my life
have I heard such language or witnessed
such a disgraceful scene."
Speaker Coombs suggested that perhaps
some of the gentlemen desired to apolo
gize.
Jones, who had been on his feet all this
time, was recognized by the cuair. Jones'
apology was an apology if looked at in
one light and it was something else if
looked at in another light. He spoke as
follows:
"Mr. Speaker and gentlemen of the
House: 1 desire to sa>*, so far as the
House is concerned, that I apologize. 1
must say that under the circumstances I
was greatly aggravated in this matter. In
the lirst place, the gentlemen on the
other side had not taken the proper course
to find out whether their assertions were
true or whether they were false. Every
assertion that I have made in this regard
to this matter I stand ready now to prove
to be the truth. I never had the repu
tation of a prevaricator under any cir
cumstances. My reputation for veracity
has always been good and I defy any gen
tleman in this House to say that he has
ever known of any case where I have pre
varicated. If any gentlemen can say that,
I would like them to come up here and
acknowledge it.
"The truth of the. whole matter is this:
About a week ago it was stated to me that
this bill had been sneaked in on this fiie.
It was never referred to a committee, as it
should have been under the rales of the
House, but was surreptitiously placed on
the file, notwithstanding that members of .'
the House asked that it be referred to I
the proper committee. That request was {
refused. I went to see the reputed author j
of the bill and tot his consent to withdraw
this bill, and 1 have no doubt he will
admit he did so, because he gnve other
members the same authority. Mr. Camin
etti said this morning that I had falsified
when I made the assertion last night when
I got up and asked leave to withdraw the
bill. In one sense that might be true,
because the gentleman in the other house
introduced it by request of another per-
I son, but tne real author of the bill con
sented that I should withdraw it. If Mr.
Caminetti had been in his seat attending
to his business he would have heard it.
Mr. Shanahan, Mr. Toland and other gen
tlemen are in favor of this cinch bill."
"I call the gentleman to order," snouted
Caminetti.
"I asked th.it the gentleman's words be
taken down," said Toland.
"Mr. Speaker!" cafled Shanahan.
"The gentleman's words will be taken
down,' 1 said Speaker Coombs, consolingly.
Jones continued: "I don't care whether
they are here or not. Every movement of
mine has been regular, and I defy any
man in this House to say that anything
is wrong. I can prove that tne assertions
of those gentlemen on the floor about the
matter are falsa in every particular and
| they know it. I have no apologies to
j make to the gentlemen, but I have already
apologised to the House, because zny feel
ings got the better cf me."
Shanahan said that there was no reason
why his name should have been inserted
in the resolution. When the Senate had â 
passed a bill and it came before tbe House,
it was unfair to attempt to recommit the
bill for the purpose of killing it. He de
nied the right of any Senator or Assembly
man to withdraw the bill in a spirit ol
duplicity and with an utter disregard of
decency.
Malcolm, Cutter and Price rose to
points of order.
Cutter said in his more sarcastic ac
cents: "I would like to ask if this is to be
considered an apology to the House."
Dennery interrupted and Shanahan at
tempted to speafc again, but Speaker
Coombs kept his gavel going line a trip
hammer.
Finally Dennery was recognized and
said: "Now that there has been so much
talking done about words. I ask that the
gentleman's words be taken down, as he
requests. I think that this body has been
idsulted as it has never been insulted be
j fore, and I ask that the word} of tbe gen-
I tlemjin from Shasta be taken down."
Pohlmann of San Francisco called to
Dennery: "More to expel him."
Caminetti denied that he had insulted
the House.
Dibble put an end to the discussion by
moving that the bill be made the special
order for 10 o'clock to-morrow morning.
The motion was carried and the white
winged doves of peace roosted on the great
chandeliers.
Jones went with Mr. Jordan of the As
sociated Press over to the Senate and
asked Senator Androus for an explana
t'on. The Senator said tnat he had given
Jones permission to withdraw the bill a
week ago. When Caminetti came to him
to-day he asked him whether he had just
given permission to Jones to withdraw
the bill. The Senator replied that he had
not, but that he had given Jones tha: per
mission a week ago and that that permis
sion still held good* When Caminetti
made his statement to the House ho sup
pressed the statement made by Senator
Androus and thereby deceived the House.
Within half an hour after thi.i trouble
Belshaw moved to take up Senate bill 314.
The discussion almost precipitated a riot.
Cutter said that tho leaders of the
minority had concluded to hold a Demo
cratic caucus, thinking that n little Demo
cratic politics could be made out of the
bill. '"There is nothing on earth In this
bill except to give the Railway Commis
sion a sort of club over streelcar compan
ies, which they may use in the next cam
paign. An annual report from the
Market-street Railway Company or the
San Mateo Company would not put down
the rates of faro one particle. They would
1 .
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 20, 1897.
have to show that the rates of fare at
present charged were higher than they
should be and that a lower rate would be
reasonable."
Cutter added that they would have to
go into court and spend $50,000 or $60,000
of the people's money to get a decision
tbat the commission was a constitutional
body with no power to do any thins.
Cross offered an amendment tnat the
provisions of the bill shall not apply to
stage lines nor streetcars, nor electric
roads within the limits of cities and
towns. The amendment was carried by a
vote of 28 ayes to 25 noes.
The following was the vote:
Ayes â Austin, Bettman, Burnham,
Canavan, Cross, Cutter, Damon, Dib
ble, Ennis, Fontana, Guy, Harris, Hill,

Cloning Hours,
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Marcb 19.â The
Senate to-day rushed through the de
ficiency and claims bills. Assembly bill
was passed compelling railroad coruDanies
to construct depots, stations, switches,
etc., on application of a sufficient number
of residents. The coyote claim bill was
taken up, debated at length and finally
declared lost â 19 to 14.
Assembly bill regulating the licensing
of private detectives and the power there
of was passed. And then the coyote claim
bill came up for reconsideration and the
vote resulted in a tie (the first tie yore in
eight sessions) and tbe Lieutenant-Gov
ernor had to cast the deciding vote. Lieu
tenant-Governor Jeter asked the consid
eration of the Senate to read the bill, after
which he voted aye, thereby passing the

RAMPANT RIVERS,
DEATH AND RUIN
Fearful Floods in Western,
Middle and Southern
States.
Many lowa Towns Under Water
and Hundreds of Families
Homeless.
Houses, Barns, Haystacks and Car
casses of Animah Gd With
the Torrents.
BIOUX CITY, lowa, March 10.â It is
the general impression here to-night that
the great flood of 1892, which did thou
sands of dollars' wortn of damaee, will be
equaled if not exceeded by the present
freshet. The Floyd and Missouri rivers
are stiil rising at the rate of an inch an
hour and haystacks and dwellings from
tne hamlets above the city are floating by
as evidences of the destruction already ac-
complished.
The towns and cities so far affected by
the flood may congratulate themselves
that the rise has not been more abruptâ a
fact which has enabled nearly every one
to escape death by drowning. Stock has
not fared so well, and the carcasses of dead
animals oan be seen now and then rush
ing by to the confluence with the Missouri.
It will be several days before the actual
extent oi the damage up the river can be
determined, as all bridges and telegraph
wires to the north are down and have been
since last evening.
This morning the bottoms on either side
oj the Fioyd River in this city were en
tirely inundated, and several hundred
bouses stand in from two to three feet of
water. Fortunately the citizens in this
district had been warned of the impend
ing danger, and moved out in advance.
This section is populated with the poorer
classes, and hundreds of families are
homeless to-night. The water had risen
this evening to the stockyards and carried
away the stockyards bridge. The fall of
this structure caused a stampede among
the cattle cooped np in the pens. The
commission men set towoikat once re
moving tne animals from the yards.
Ttie ice in the river stiil holds firm,
which only adds to the apprehension of
the railroad men.
At 10:30 o'clock to-night the Sioux City
and Nortnern bridge across tl)6 Floyd was
swept away, and several others will prob
ably go soon. At 10:30 o'clock the river
was stiil rising.
The Big Sioux flood is growing much
worse. From Westtieid, north of the city,
a rise of twelve feet in four hours is re
ported and a booming current is swooping
t&rough the streets of the town. Bridges
and culverts ou the Milwaukee road are
all gone ana traffic is entirely tied up.
At midnight the Missouri River had
fallen tnree feet in a few hours, indicating
either that a gorge below had broken or
that a new one is forming above.
Lynn, Bpringdale, James, Htnton, Mer
rill and Hawarden are all under water.
Small streums all over the Northwest are
flooding tho bottoms and carrying away
hay and grain.
The only fatality thui far reported is
that of a farmer named Watson, said to
have been drowned near Hinton while at
tempting to save his property. Railroad
traffic in every direction from this point is
suspended.
A report from Pender, Nebr., says that
one-third of the bouses in that town are
under water. The Logan River at that
point is rapidly rising and great damage
is expected.
WEBSTER CITY, lowa, March 19.â
Trains over the Omaha and Minneapolis
Railroad are running forty miles around
through this place over tha Chicago and
Northwestern because of hieh waier and
weakened bridges. This afternoon Dr.
Travis of Eagle Grove and a farmer named
Klrkberger were drowned while trying to
ford the Boone River near here. The
team, buggy and occupants were swept
away. At 6 o'clock to-night the Boone
had risen seven feet and is rising at the
rate of a fool an hour. The large bridge
at Lehigh was swept away and others are
threatened.
CHEROKEE, lowa, March 19.â The
L ; ttle Sioux is higher than at any time
since the floods of 189 L All railroaa com
munication, except over the Illinois Cen
tral south of Onawa, is cut off. Three
large bridges are washed out between here
and Sioux Falls, S. D., on the Illinois
Central. Wagon bridges are generally
swept away and all communication East
is cut off. The railroad bridge at Merrill
is reported gone. The people have sought
the highlands and much hay and grain on
the bottoms is destroyed.
FORT DODGE, lowa, March 19.â The
Dcs Mi;ines River here is the highest in
year?. Manufacturing establishments on
the bottoms have closed.
HAWARDEN, lowa, March 19â Water
four feet deep in places fills the streets
here. The railway bridges across the Bic
Sioux are impassable. The water is rising
six inches an hour. People in the bottoms
are living in the second stories of their
houses. There is great, damage to loose
property and much stuck has been
drowned.
LEMARS, lowa, March 19.-There has
been no communication between here and
Sioux City since last night. The bridges
on the Illinois Central, Sioux City and
Northern and the Chicago, St. Paul, Min
neapolis and Omaha over Floyd River
have been washed out or weakened so as
to be unsafe.

UKIAH MURDER CASE.
Counsel for Rancher Henderson's Alleged
Slayer Advances the Plea of
Insanity.
UKIAH, Cau, March 19.â A jury was
finally sworn in this morning in the case
of the people vs. Gregorio Berevara, the
alleged murderer of Rancher Henderson.
For the first time during the proceedings
the defendant relaxed his usual sullen de
meanor. When District Attorney George
A. Sturtevant in his opening audress to
the jury reierred to the incidents imme
diately preceding the killing of Hender
son, Berevara arose to his feet and uttered
loud protests ag ainst the statement, cf the
District Attorney. In a moment a Deputy
Sheriff was at his side, and he subsided
without further trouble.
The prosecution's case was a short one.
The only witnesses produced by the
people were William Owens and John
MacPheraou, two eye-witnesses of the
killing; Detective Ciarence )V. BrobacK
and Under Sheriff Philo Handy, who tes
tified to statements made by the prisoner
while in the County Jail; Miss Jessie
Boith, who told of having found in the
defendant's cabin the kr.i.e with which
Henderson is supposed to have been
stabbed; Dr. G. W. Stout, who described
the wounds, and one or two persons called
to identify the clothing taken from the
deceased.;
The first witness called by the defense
was Dr. E. W. King, superintendent of the
Mendocino Asylum, who stated that me
Dnsoner was received at the asylum on
May 4, 1894, from Alameda, and dis
charged a year later as cured. C. W.
Mero. an attendant at the asylum, testi
fied to the same effect. Martin Hart, n
constable of Westport Township, in the
northern part of this county, detailed the
arrest of Berevara in October last on a
charge of insanity. At that time he was
discharged as sane.
At this point in the proceedings the
prisoner was called to the stand by his
atiorney. Â«nd after an attempt was made
to examine in the English language an in
terpreter was sworn. Berevara gave
rambling answers, and finally refused to
say anything further. He claims to know
nothing of Henderson or the murder. At
one time during the examination he
spang to his feet, and in an angry tone ad
dressed himself in Spanish to bis counsel,
at the same time bursting into tears.

D scovery Mide at Carson That the

Too Small.
CARSON, Nev., March 19.âFitzsira
raqns, accompanied by his wife ar.d child,
Stelzner and Hickey, left on the 6:30
o'clock cv ning train for San Francisco,
where he will give a boxing exhibition to
morrow night with nis sparring partners,
Hickey and Steizner. He was driven in
at about 6 o'clock and walked up to the
train, followed by a crowd of admirers
and curiosity-seekers, all anxious to get a
last look at the man who wrested the
championship from Corbett. When asked
if it was tru that he intended to retire
from the ring permanently he said :
"Y. s; I promised my wife before the
battle that it would be my last fight, and
intended to abide by that promise.
Henceforth all statements sienÂ»d by me
* shall read: 'Robert Fitzsimmons, retired
heavy-weight and middle-weight cham
pion of the world.' "
And' those who witnessed the fight be
lieve he is wise from a busin -ss stanJ
point in not tackling Corbett again.
Martin Julian and Roeber remained
over to settle up all the accounts. Fitz
simmons has sent notifications to Corbett,
Goddard, Choynski, Sullivan, Sharkey,
Maher and the other aspirants for the
championship that he nas retired from
the ring permanently, and that they will
have t.o battle among themselves for the
honors he has laid aside.
Dan Stuart has come out $20,000 short
off the carnival, exclusive of the kineto
scope privilege, but if the latter comes up
to his expectations ne will be on a good
financial Dasis after all.
P. J. Donahue, the architect from San
Francisco who erected the arena, has at
tached Dan Stuart for $299 due on con
tract. He has engaged James D. Torrey
son as counsel, and the case will come up
in the District Court to-morrow.
By the order of the referee, before the
fight, the ring was enlarged two feet on
all sides by a shelving constructed around
it; but on the evening before the battle,
when everything was dark and there was
no danger of discovery, Wheelock hunted
up Carpenter Franklin and handed him
an order signed by Stuart to cut off two
feet all around, putting the ring back
to 'its original size. Tidball, the chief
ring equipper, placed the posts back, mak
ing the ring 22 feet square instead of 28,
as the plans called for. This was done to
favor the kinetoscope people, but is In
direct violation of the rules and may cause
some complications.
Since "Mysterious" Billy Smith and
.Flaherty lost their respective fieh-ts they
have been in a Dad state of intoxication.
Smjth in particular has been the cause of
a great deal of trouble, and has found his
way to the County Jail several times.
This evening he was ordered to leave
town, but caused such a disturbance in
the train, with a few of his jubilant part
ners, that he was taken back to jail, the
conductor refusing to lave him as a pas
senger. It seems that guns were drawn
on all sides and for a few minutes things
looked serious. The authorities say that
they will take good care of Smith until to
morrow evening and will place him on the
train in a sober condition.
Dan Stuart was asked if he would con
tinue to give fights in Nevada and replied
that he would, as he is now in the busi
ness and sees no way to get out of it at
present. The arena will stand where it is,
the judges' stand being raised to allow
the race officials an unobstructed view of
the races, and the outer edees of the arena
will be used more or lesÂ« as a grand stand.
Billy Madden, who was official time
keeper at the fight, departed for his home
in New York to-night. Referee Siler left
for San Francisco, whence, aftei a few
crays' visit, he will return to Chicago.

CENSURE ARIZONA'S GOVERNOR.
Legislators Denounce Franklin and He in
â¢ â  Turn Accuses Them of Selling
totes.
PHCENIX, Ariz., March 19.â The final
adjou'i. m utof the Legislature this morn
ing came at the end of one of the warmest
ses-iious ever held in Arizona. The last
officuil act of thÂ» Assembly was to pass a
vote of censure on Governor Franklin, and
express its beiief that the best interests of
the Territory would be subserved by a
cpe^dy chnnge in executives. Tne imme
diate cause of this was the Governor's re
fusal to return several bills the Legislature
wanted ;*pass over his veto.
Governor Franklin is a most choleric
man and when senn this morning he waÂ«
bitter in denouncing the Legislature. He
said he believed the resolution of censure
was written by M. H. McCord, one of the
most prominent candidates to succeed
h.m. Concerning the salary reinstate
ment bill, which was passed over his veto,
the Governor said:
"A member of my administration re
ceived word from one of the Pima County
As--emb!ymen tiiat my signature to the
b^li would be worth $500 to me."
Early id the session a bill to tax the
net iÂ«roceeds of mines was killed by
both houses. Concerning this Governor
Franklin openly charged that a repre
sentative of a gold-mining company
bad been sent down from Prescott
with $6000 with which to defeat the meas
ure and that the lobbyist loand it neces
sary to spend only $2000 to buy enouga
votes to kili the bill.
Governor Franklin characterized this as
the worst Legislature that bad ever met
in Arizona. On the other hand the mem
bers of the Legislature itill in town score
the executive roundly for pocket-vetoing
eleven bills. One of these was an excel
lent measure requiring all territorial
officals to submit estimates of expendi
tures for the coming year's budget.
There is much feeling over the defeat of
this measure, and the Democratic leeis
lators and the Democratic Governor are
saying very hard things of each other.
TACOMA INJUNCTION SUIT.
Two Corporations Compelled to Cease
Work With the Patented Dredger
Atlas.
TACOMA, Wash.. March 19.â Judge
Hanford of the United States Court to
day granted a temporary injunction to
hold until trial, against the New York
Dredging Company and the San Francisco
Bridge Company, restraining tfrem % from
further use of the dredger Atlas, some
times known as the Oakland. The in
junction was granted on application of
the Bowers Dredging Company. The
Atlas has been at work for several months
ilredginsr Olympia harbor and is now
stationed at Everett at work on a big
contract there. The order will put stop
to all further work.
Judge Hanford several months ago de
cliued to issue a temporary injunction,
holding that no c amiant to a patent
Could secure an injunction unless able to
show the validity of his patents sustained
in a court of last resort. This the Bowers
Dredging Company was unable to do at
that time, as tne quest* ri of ownership
was then pending on appeal of the '!Â«â¢
fendants from the judgment of the Dia
tr.ct Conrt of California. whicU had been
in favor of the Bowers Dredging Com
pany. He left it open to the plaintiffs to
make further application to the court
whenever it should appear they had ob
tained such final judgment.
A month ago the application was re
newed, it being alleged that the Circuit
Court of Appeals of California had decided
in favor of the judgment of the lower
court, which finally placed the sole owner
ship of ttie patent with the Bowers Dredg
ing Company. The New York Dredging
Company and the S;in Francisco Bridge
Company resisted the application, claim
ing rights j rior to the existence of the
Bowers patent, but Judge Hanford held
the decision of the Circu t Court of Ap
peals bad effectually determined and set
tled all contention.
RIVERSIDE IRRIGATION SUIT.
Ex- Vice- President Stevenson and Wife
Numbered Among the
Plaintiffs.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 19.âAn
other important irrigation district suit
has been commenced in San Bernardino.
In this case the bonds of an irrigation dis
trict, formed under the Wright act, are
claimed to have been fraudulently issued
and to be void, and an injunction is asked
from the conrts to prevent the sale of
lands declared delinquent on assessments
and forbidding the issuance of deeds on
such sale. The plaintiff-; in the suit are
ex-Vice-President Adlai E. Stevenson and
his wife, and George B. Pickett and Anna
M. Bullis. The defendants are Howard T.
Hays, collector of the East Riverside Ir
rigation District, and the irrigation dis
trict itself.
The plaintiffs claim that in 1895 an as
sessment was made, amounting to $6 80
on every $100 of assessed value of ineir

Two Days After His Marriage, Rancher
Blanton Suddenly Becomes
a Maniac.
FRESNO, Cal., March 19.â A. F. Blan
ton, a young rancher, whose home is near
Selma, was committed to the Stockton
Insane Asylum by Judge Risley to-day.
Last Saturday Blanton was married to
Miss Bophronia Jane Dean of Birchtree,
Mo., wbo came to California to wed the
young farmer. At the time of the wed
ding there was nothing to indicate any
thing wrong with his mind. On Monday
be became a maniac on the subject of
religion.
Of late Blanton has been attending a
series of revival meetings in Selma. He
went to church with his bride on Sunday
evening and seemed to be affected by the
sermon. Numerous friends congratulated
him on his marriage and this also tended
to excite him. Not until Mondr.y, how
ever, did the man's miml give way. He
imagines that ha is to preach the gospel,
and is a raving maniac.
B anton's bride is taking the unfor
tnnate circumstances very much to heart.
She and her husband became acquainted
in Missouri several years ago and he came
to California to get a start in life, it being
agreed that they would marry as soon as
he could buy a home. Now, when the
happy hopes were just realized, the eroom
becomes a maniac and the wife is
distraught, with grief.
FLEES FROM PETALUMA.
A Poolroom Auctioneer Decamps With
Money Wagered on the Carson
Fight
PETALUMA, Cal., March 19.â The sad
effects 'of the Carson fight have reached
even this law-abiding town. George W.
Burling by trade a cigar-maker, is miss
ine, and with him the poolbox contain*
ing money wagered on the Corbett-
Fitzsimmons fight. Burling was the
auctioneer in the pool selling at the grill
room for several days before the fight.
The box contained about $230.
Burling should have cashed the win
ning tickets at the grillroom yesterday
afternoon and he was on hand before the
appointed time, but he disappeared and
has not since been seen. The small boy
tells bow he saw Burling being driven
out of town, and the supposition is that,
if not apprehended by the telegrams sent,
he will leave the State. Much sympathy
is felt for bis family, which he left with
out a word, his wife being an estimable
lady.
IHE CA.HHUM KILLING.
Evidence That Smith Bleu) Bradford in
f*lf-Vtfen%m.
CARSON, Nev., March 19.â An inquest
was held to-day over the body of William
Bradford of Anaconda, Mont., who died
last evening from a bullet wound, inflicted
by W. H. Smith on the night of the 17th.
The two men quarreled and Bradford*
struck Smith on the lace several times.
Smith drew a revolver and fired, the ball
striking Bradford in .the abdomen and
coming out his back. The Coroner's jury
brought in a verdict in accordance with
these facts. The general impression is
that Smith shot in self-defense, as he still
bears the marks of Bradford's blows, and
that it will be impossible to convict him.

STOCKTON'S FIRE
FIEND A GIRL
Fourteen- Year- Old Mildred

Incendiarism.
*
Charged With Having Started
Two Large Conflagrations
of Recent Date.
One of Hsr Playmates Siys She
Bojstei of Her Crimes and
Planned Others.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 19.â The
police are busy investigating a itorv which
connects Mildred WebÃter, a pretty but
wayward Stockton miss of 14 summers,
with the starting of the two recent tires
in this city. One of these burned the
coffin factory to the ground, and the
other left nothing but ashes of the pack
ing-house of the Earl Fruit Company,
near the railway freight depot. The police
were told by a young girl named Minerva
McMullen that, while watching the burn
ing of the packing- house, in company
with Mildred Webster, the latter said that
she had tired the coffin factory and also
the building that was burning before
them.
According to the McMullen girl, Mil
dred said that she intended to burn three
cottages to be avenged on some of those
who had been instrumental in haying the
police try to keep her from her wayward
habits. Others told the officers that the
Webster girl had admitted that she had
fired the coffin factory, and declared prev
ious to Monday night that there would be
another fire on that night. True to her
assertion, the Earl Fruit Company's pack
ing-house was burned.
Mildred called at the police office to
night and denied that any of the stories
told about her were true. The child has
been incorrigible for the past six months,
and in spite of the efforts of the police
and the captain of the American Volun
teers, with whom she has been staying,
she appears to be utterly depraved. Her
escapades have been the talk of the town
for some time, and every effort to reform
the girl has been without avail. The police
are now trying to find out whether she
actually did set tne tires or merely said so
to increase her reputation for depravity.

The Shanties on Montgomery Avenue That Are Condemned by the Board of Health.
OLD ROOKERIES
THAT ARE DOOMED
The Heart of Barbary
Coast Divedom to Be
Plucked.
Low Wooden Buildings at Mont
gomery Avenue and Kearny
Street.
â 
A Notorious Group of Patched-Up Old
Shanties Ft quented by
- -\ -.Old Hags- â¢' .. -* .
A canker sore in. the heart of the Bar
bary Coast â a low wedge of dilapidated
wooden rookeries leaning upon them
selves at the corner of Kearny street and
Montgomery avenue â must be plucked
from that conspicuous position. ; The
Board of Health has condemned the irreg
ular pile and its equipment as dangerous
and unhealthy to human occupation.'
Old, unstable, with un perpendicular
I walls and unnorizontal floors and with
compartments honeycombing: the 'unin
viting '-( structure, it forms a hell's '. vent
hole \ where I nightly congregate the more
abandoned and dirty hags of the dive
element.
The place is historic in its way, in its
crooked way. For nearly forty years the
building, or collection of pasteboard
shanties, has stood on the spot proof
against a dozen fires. In 1868, "Billy"
Dwyer, the prize-fighter, kept a restaurant
there. That was several years before
Montgomery avenue was cut through and
the buildings were changed into their
present triangular shatie.
According to one of the oldest residents
of the neighborhood, "It was always a
notorious place, but never worse than it is
now." Under it, below the level of the
street and below the sewer, is a stable
hidden from view and reached by raising
a Dart of the sidewalk, beneath which there
is an inclined way leading from the curb
down into the suoterreanean home of
horse, dog and scores of timorous rats.
When an officer of the Board of Health
made an examination of the premises a
snort time ago he found thai the place had
not been cleaned out in two years.
Above such a foundation are two sa
loons. They have entrances conveniently
on both streets. Each is supplied with a
piano, whereon the nocturnal revelers
pound out discordant tunes. The wall
paper io streaked and Boiled overhead by
leaks and lower down by a row oi circular
blotches from greasy heads.
There is nothing in them to attract,
nothing to charm the ordinary habitue of
a saloon except the stock behind the bars,
and that appears meager and untempting.
The miserable pic:ures, the coarse drink
ing tables, the tawdry pieces of portieres
that as occasion demands may be drawn
along on a wire and used as a screen by
the patrons, the rough chairsâ all indicate
the element that is catered to. The char
acter of the interior is in keeping with
what is below and what is above.
And yet the occupants can see nothing
wrong with the place. "It's all right," re
marked one of the barkeepers. "It's safe.
Nothing but nice quiet people come here â
sailors and sucli. The boss has been
spending a good deal of money painting
round and tiling the place up at his own
expense and now they want to tear it
down."
The boss is a man named Silva who
leases the whole from the Cook estate and
sublets the various little compartments.
In addition to the two saloons there is a
barber-shop and a tailor-shop. Piled on
top of these at the rear is a small rookery
with three rooms, in which two men lye.
The very point of the triangle next to
the Copsweh's fountain is owned by Cogs
well. It i< a little piece about fourteen
feet on Montgomery avenue and eight
feet on Kearny street and yet it is rented
for a midnight sandwich counter and for
s daytime bootblack stand.
The prospective destruction and removal
of t!,e old rookeries is very pleasing to
those who own property in 'heneighbo;
hood, for the buildings and their uses
have been a constant cause ot distress to
them.
IS THE SELLER GUILTY?
The Board of Health and the merchants
Are Not Agreed on Adulter
ated Food.
A long conference of the Board of
Health with representatives of the mer
cantile boÂ«Jies of this City relatve to ihe
detection of adulterated foods was held
last night in the City Hall.
Dr. Morse, president of the Board of
Health, brought the whole discussion to
an amiable and agreeable close by a
motion that a conference of delegates
from all bodies interested be held this
afternoon, at 3:30 o'clock, for the purpose
of determining some equitable method of
dec^dinsr upon the character of the goods
offered for sale by eacb merchant.
The following representatives were ac
cordingly appointed by Mayor Pnelan,
vao wns presiding over the meet'ng:
Hugo Kyle and Mr. Kelly of the Mer
chants' Association, J. W. Kerr and Isa
dore Jacobs of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association, Dr. Morse and
Dr. Williamson 01 the Board of Health,
and, as honorary and consulting mem
bers, J. B. Keinstein and Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Joseph Dunn.
The contention during the meeting was
over : lie disputed question as to whether
or not the retail dealer should be prose
cuted for sellin-r gooiis found to be adul
terated, though he was all along ignorant
of the fact.
AH persons present, and most of them
spoke upon the subject, were in sympathy
with the movement against traffic in
adulterated articles, most of which are
imported from tne East and sold to the
detriment of home-manufactured goods
of similar kinds.
Assistant District Attorney Dunn, who
secured the first conviction under the new
statute against adulterated foods, ex
plained that the law in this and other
States held the dealer to be guilty
whether or not he knew that the goods
were adulterated. The dealer is in the
same position as the man possessing
counterfeit coin. It is his lookout that he
does not get the spurious article from
other?. The only qneitions linger the
statute are: "Did ne sell it? Was it
adulterated?"
"I wish to say," remarked the Assistant
District Attorney, "that District Attorney
Barnes instructed me to inform yon that
his office is heartily in favor of this move
ment. My idea would be to go after the
I seller, to hound him, to prosecute him
1 until the merchants would in self-defense
compel the producer to furnish them with
a guarantee of purity and a bond of in
demnity with every lot of goods supplied
them."
Those sentiments did not meet with the
; exact approval of all. Among them J.
Richard Freud, A. Sbarboro, James A.
Filcher and others.
"All we want," said Mr. Dohrmann, "is
fairness, a system established whereby a
merchant may know whether or not his
goods are pure.' 1
P. J. Healy of the Mechanics' Institute,
Julian Sonntag of the Manufacturers' and
Producers 1 Association, J. B. Keinstein,
Mr. Romley of the State Agricultural So
ciety, Oscar Lewis, Hugo D. Keil, Nathan
Bibo, A. Q'.iade and others spoke.
Mrs* Lucia McCormick,
Who died at her residence, 2822 Bash
street, on March 17, was the widow of Dr.
William McCormick, formerly of Grass
Valley. The deceased Wb.s a native of
Ohio, in which State she was born 67 yeirs
ago. She was one of the early California
pioneer women, who came to this State and
settled in the mining; regions when the
presence of whiya women was a rarity. By
her kind acts she made a host of friends,
and, with her husband, was well known
in this State and Nevada. She leaves a son
and daughter, besides a host of friends, to
mourn her loss.

ENEMIES OF UNIONISM
Were Hauled Over ths Coals by
th? Labor Council Last
Evening.
Toland's Tramp Bill Denounced.
Colonel Oiis Is Not W. nted in
the Cabinet
Several matters of importance were
acted upon by the San Franci >:o Labor
Council at its meeting last evening. Dele
gate McArthur reported the proceedings
of the Labor Convention last Sunday.
The condemnation of the citizens' com
mittee for deriding to pay the rtnemployed
$1 a day for work on the boulevard was in
dorsed.
The delegate from the Musicians' Union
bad a long complaint to make. He stated
that the union is being greatly annoyed
by the increase and employment of scab
or non-union bands and orchestras. Ho
cited several case".
The Order of Chosen Friends has hired
such an orchestra for its ball in O â â¢<!
.fellows' Hall in April. Another is hired
in a restaurant on Market street, nearly
opposite Grant avenue. An orchestra of
this description is employed in tne Palace
Hotel, and still another plays on Saturday
nights in the California Market. The
delegate stated that t h â¢ latter "pass around
the hat" for what they can get. The
Creamerie orchestra works for its board
and a small amount of money, while the
Palace Hotel Chosen Friends' musicians
are working for far less than union rates.
The council sei on foot a movement that
it is bel.eved will cause those who hire
such musicians to see that they will be
benefited by making a change. '
Assemblyman Toiand's tramp bill came
in for a round scoring. On it 3 face it is
"to provide for the employment of the
neÂ«dy unemployed and of vagrants under
sentence." The former by. applying to
Supervisors of counties, where the act
shall be taken advantage of, will be pro
vided with work on county roads or on
the county farm for 35 cents a day.
Idle men, designated as tramps and
vagrants, who decline to work for this
amount, upon being sentenced for va
grancy will be compelled to do the sam^
work during their terms of sentence for 10
cents a day. Upon refusine to work for
10 cents they will be put upon one meal of
bread and water a day until they consent
to work. This measure has passed both
houses of the Legislature.
The bill was assailed for making idle
ness, enforced or voluntary, a statutory
offense punishable by methods of five
centuries ago; also that it eives scheming
county officials opportunities to enslave
every man who tramps and carries a pack
because he is too poor to ride, and compel
him to work for the benefit of the county ;
and last but not least, that it lowers the
standard of wages and the dignity of la
bor. The secretary was authorized to
send to Governor Budd the following tele
gram :
San Fbancisco Labor Cocncix, >
March 19, 1897. j
Governor Budd, Sacramento: We oppose As
sembly bill 285 as reactory and dangerous
to the liberties of citizens. Under pretense of
State charity it establishes a pauper wage,
constitutes mere idleness a statutory crime
and prescribes cruel and unnatural punish
ment. We respectfully urire that you veto said
bill. Ed Rosenberg,
Secretary San Francisco Building Trades'
Council
Colonel H. 6. Otis of the Los Angeles
Times also came in for a roasting at
the hands of organized labor. Dele
gate Hawkes of the executive committee
stated that the colonel aspires to be a
Cabinet officer in this administration and
that be wants to be the Assistant Secre
tary of War. Hawkes stated that Colonel
Otis has for years been the bitterest of
enemies of organized labor and has even
sent fourteen of his own scab printers to
Tacoma to a paper there whose proprietor
was making a tight to reduce printers'
wages.
Such a man, he continued, is too dan
gerous to the unions of the United States
to be put io near the head of the War
Department. Recognizing this fact the
executive committee had sent the follow
ing dispatch to Congressman Overstreet,
wliich was indorsed by the council:
Pan Francisco, March 16, 1897.
Jessie Overstreet, Jf. < Â Washington, D. C. :
The San Francisco La ho r Council emphatically
protests against the appointment of H. G. Otis
to any position under ihis administration.
His open and bitter antagonism to all labor
organizations would cause such action to be
re;arded as little less than deliberate insult to
organized labrr in this State.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
SATURDAY MARCH 20, 1897
Attend the Cuban mass-meeting.
Join the rally at Metropolitan Temple.
The cause of free Cuba is the cause of
America.
Leave your oraers to-day for The Sun
day Call.
The telegrams from Carson announce
that "next day it snowed."
' Protection to American citizens must be
â assured abroad as well as at home.
The powers have landed on Crete and
it looks like a knockout for the Greeks.
If everything moves right one of the
best ends aimed at by the Legislature will
be attained to-day.
The tariff bill is ready, Congress is
ready and the country is ready, so now let
the machinery begin to move.
All sections o! the State report abundant
rains and prospects of pood harvests of all
kinds. The outlook is becoming brilliant.
The boulevard movement is good, but it
should not distract attention from the
Federal building. Let us pet all the work
started that we can.
It is comforting to note that all the so
called scandals of this Legislature have
been found on investigation to be no more
than the idle talk of fakers and tale
bearers.
The Republican party has never failed
to provide protection to industry and
revenues for the Government, and it is for
that reason the people hail the new tariff
with confidence and rejoicing.
Gladstone's contemptuous allusions to
the Czar of Russia and the Kaiser of Ger
many will not add to the harmony of
nations. The Grand Old Man has a ten
dency to talk tbe truth too much.
The action of tbe great powers in block
ading the ports of Greece is hardly com
mendable, but it must be admitted it has
. had the effect of clearing the sky. The
atmosphere is not nearly so war cloudy as
it was.
As it is said to cost New York about
$3000 a year to print the rules and regula
tions of the Police Department it would
eeem to be time for the department to
adopt a rule to get along with a little less
printing.
According to the Railway Age the pro
jected lines of railway whicn may be
undertaken this year have an aggregate of
over 1700 miles and the outlook for rail
road building is bright enough to cast its
rays all over the Union.
The Carnival of the Golden Gate will
Boon be attracting the attention not only
of the State, but of tbe Union. It is to be
a festival of more then ordinary splendor
and ma-nitude and may even eclipse the
glories of the New Orleans Mardi Gras.
The nevrly incorporated Home and Help
Supply Association has the possibility of
becominc one of the permanently useful
organizations of the City. Its mission is
good, its work is needed and if properly
managed will receive support from a wide
circle of citizens.
A just cause of pressing importance and
the oratory of eloquent speakers invite the
people to the Cuban mass-meeting to be
held this evening, and it goes without say
ing there will be an audience large, enthu
siastic and thoroughly American in
thought and Jeeling.
There are times in California when we
have so much fruit we can neither sell It
nor give it away and are forced to throw
it into the sea. This being so it would be
a better plan to throw the adulterated
jams and jellies overboard and keep the
whole home market for good fruit.
There are fears among the orchardists
of the possibilities of a late frost, but they
do not seem to be well founded. Because
Buch a frost occurred last year is no reason
for believing that another will happen.
They are rare in California, and we are
not likely to have them two years in suc
cession.
The Legislature has passed the constitu
tional amendment which will, when
adopted, allow San Francisco to pay its
back debts, and we have therefore the
'prospect of being able at last to be as
honest in fact as we are in desire. The
people have loner wished to pay these old
.debts, and will be pleased when they have
secured the right to do it.
The shipbuilders of San Francisco have
furnished the Union with two more fight
ing ships as good as any of their class in
the world, and we have thus another occa
sion to be proud of our workers. There is
no reason why San Francisco should not
be the shipbuilding center of the Pacific
Ocean, and the Union Iron WorKs is
doing much to make it so.
The movement to unite the Transvaal
with the Orange Free State is in line with
the policy of Cecil Rhodes to unite all South
Africa, but unfortunately the movement
is not going alone the line in his way. If
there is anything which can head off the
schemes of this ambitious builder of an
empire it would be the proposed union of
the two free republics, and the very at
tempt at such a union will probably cause
him to lose a good deal of sleep during
hi> enforced stay in London.
AN AMERICAN CAUSE.
The mass-meeting to be held at Metropolitan Temple this evening has been called
for the purpose of showing that the sentiments of San Francisco are in accord with
those of her sister cities on the double issue of Cuban independence and protection to
American citizens who are exposed to the tyranny of Spain. It is therefore a meet
ing which appeals to every citizen whose heart is responsive to the cause of freedom
among American communities, or to the claims of Americans suffering wrong at the
hands of foreign despots.
The cause of Cuba, while it appeals most forcibly to Americans because the island
is American, is one which stirs the blood of all who love liberty and have true feel
ings of humanity. The oppressions wrought in Cuba by the Spaniards for nearly a
century include almost every species of offense known to tyranny. Every means
which cunning can devise or malice execute to crush the aspiring people of the island
has b?en resorted to at one time or another by the dominating power of Spain. In
every home of that ill-fated island there is some record of cruelty and wrong commit
ted by the rulers whom Spain has sent to govern tnem, and the brave people have
been forced to rise and tnke arms for liberty as the sole means of maintaining life it
telf.
Some years ago there was published a volume bearing the sisnificant title, "The
Book ot Blood." It was a record of the history of Cuba for fifty years. It did no more
than narrate the deeds wnich have been done in the island during that time to prevent
tne people from establishing their independence. Nevertheless, it fully deserved the
title given it. The whole history of Cuba in our generation has bsen made up of the
glory reflected by heroes struggling for liberty, contrasted with the darkness of the
bloodstains they have left on battle-fieids or in the dungeons and on the scaffolds of
the Spaniards.
The justice of the Cuban cause has been attested by every American who has
any knowledge of tne conditions that prevail in the island. So universal is the
sympathy with the patriots of all Americans residing in any part of Cuba that they
are regarded by the Spaniards as enemies, and are treated as such. The Spanish
authorities have not waited for them to commit overt acts of assistance to the
patriot?, but have tazen their American citizenship as evidence of hostility to Spain,
and have inflicted upon them a thousand indignities and wrongs.
Our fellow-countrymen in Cuba call to us for protection from the despotism under
wheh they suffer. Their only offense is that they have sympathized with liberty
and have regarded with favor the struggles of brave men to free themselves from the
tyranny of a foreign domination. To their appeals we must respond. We must
show them that our sympathies are the same as their own, and that we have the
willingness as well as the power to save.
In the movement to be forwarded by the mass-meeting San Francisco will not act
alone. She will simply take her place beside her sister cities of the Union. She will
manifest the true Americanism of her people. She will add another voice to those
that call upon the Government at Washington to use its power to put an end to the
outrages against humanity in Cuba. She will attest the devotion of her people to
liberty, the independence of American States, the rights of citizens of the Republic to
ample protection both at horns and abioad, and to those abiding principles of
humanity which are everywhere cherished by genuine manhood.
BEPUBLICAN DOOTBINE.
Ever since McKinley's accession to office
there has been more or less speculation as
to what policy his administration will
pursue in regard to Cuba. It would seem
that these questions could be most easily
settled by turning to the platform on
which he was elected and to his inaugural
address. These documents contain author
itative statements and are sufficiently
clear to be understood by all classes of
people.
The platform adopted by the Repub
lican National Convention at St. Louis
last June declares:
From the hour of achieving their own inde
pendence the people of the United States have
regarded with sympathy the struggles of other
American peoples to free themselves from
European domination. We watch with deep
and abiding interest the heroic battle of the
Cuban patriots against cruelty and oppression,
and our best hopes go out for the full success
of their determined contest for liberty. The
Government of Spain having lost control of
Cuba and being unable to protect the property
or lives of resident American citizens, or to
comply with its treaty obligations, we believe
that the Government of the United States
should actively use its Influence and good
offices to restore peace and give independence
to the island.
On that platform McKinley was nomi
nated and elected. In his inaugural ad
dress ho declared: "It will be our aim to
pursue a firm and dignified foreign
policy which shall be just, impartial,
ever watchful of our National honor,
and always insisting upon the en
forcement of the rights of Ameri
can citizens everywhere." The statement
of the inaugural address it couched in the
language of diplomacy, but the meaning
is the same as thai in the platform, that
Spain, being unable to maintain law in
Cuba or fulfill its treaty obligations, it is
time tbe United Slates should interfere
for the protection of American citizens
residing there and to promote the inde
pendence erf the island.
In February, 1896, the Cubans issued an
address setting forth the causes which
impelled them to take up arms, and ask
ing recognition as independent people.
In the course of this address they said:
"To whom should we appeal if not to
America? To what land il not to that of
Washington, of Jefferson, of Monroe, of
Jackson, of Grant, of Blame, of Cleveland
and of the immortal Lincoln?" The land
of Cleveland, while Cleveland was at the
head of it, did not respond either to aid
the Cubans or to protect American citi
zens. We may exoect different things
from McKinley.
AN ARIZONA BOOM.
The mining excitement In this State
over (he gold discoveries at Randsburg
has been followed by one which promises
to be equally great in the mining district
around Yuma, Ariz. According to re
ports the new discoveries made in the
district are among the most notable of
recent years and great expectations are
held of golden results.
The stories which come to us from
Yuma are, of course, colored by the ex
citement which prevails there ana may be
to a large extent exaggerated. When full
allowance is made for the exaggerations,
however, there will still remain sufficient
reason for believing that this portion of
Arizona is to have a great mining revival
during the year and will add largely to
the supply of gold.
It is reported that the mining claim in
the new district which has been most de
veloped has been found to grow richer and
wider as the development goes on. At
the present time the ledge is said to be
twelve feet wide, and some authorities
estimate that the rock will not fall far
short of $2000 a ton. Such reports as this
have natually attracted miners from all
parts of the country and as a result the
new district is being rapidly settled up
and explored.
The interests of Arizona are so nearly
identical with those of California that the
new mining Doom in that State will be
almost as advantageous to us as the rich
discoveries at Randsburg. We have,
therefore, every reason for hoping that the
Yuma district will prove as prontable as
the most sanguine expect. There are a
thousand opportunities for money-making
in Arizona and many people who are
attracted there by the gold mines will
find other resources awaiting development
and other chances for the prontable in
vestment of capital. Even if the mining
boom, therefore, should prove to be noth
ing more than an advertisement for the
Territory it will be beneficial and Cali
fornia m^ justly congratulate the people
of Arizona on the prospect before them.
The amount ol rejoicing amon ,' the
Democrats of New York over the success
of their party in carrying Bath in the re
cent municipal election is surprising. We
knew, of course, they needed a Bath, but
did not expect them to jubilate in obtain
ing it.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 20, 1897.
GLADSTONE'S PAMPHLET.
The pamphlet of Mr. Gladstone on "The
Eastern Crisis," while it may have the
effect of arousing public opinion in Eng
land and awakening a keener sympathy
with the Greek patriots, is not likely to
add to tbe harmony of the great powers
nor to make the diplomatic task of Lord
Salisbury any easier. It is in fact not so
much an appeal to reason as a trumpet
call to battle, and is better calculated to
cause a war thau to promote the continu
ance of peace.
The most notable feature of the pamphlet
is the reference made to the attitude of
German/ and Russia. On this point Mr.
Gladstone says: "At this moment two
great states with a European population
of 150,000,000 are under the government of
two young men, each bearing the title of
Emperor; one wholly without experience
and theother having only such knowledge
and experience â in truth limited enough
â as to have excited astonishment and
consternation when an inkling of them
was given to the world. These, bo far as
their sentiments are known, are using
their power in concert to light steadily
against freedom. Why are we to have
our Government pinned to their aprons?"
Such statements as these are not likely
to win favor either in Germany or in Rus
sia. If they have any effect at ali it will
be only to increase the antagonism now
felt in those countries toward Great
Britain. Comin? from a man of such em
inence, who is known to have great weight
and influence with the English people,
they can hardly fail to irritate the Gov
ernnients of the Czar and Kaiser and to
render them more averse than ever to co
operate with the liberal movement in Eu
rope in the settlement of the Turkish ques
tion and the libeiation of the people of
Crete from Moslem domination.
Despite his personal greatness and his
success a 8 a statesman Mr. Gladstone has
been at all periods of hi 3 life too much of
a rhetorician. More than once when out
of office he has spoken words in the glow o f
fervid oratory which he had to recant
when he returned to power and was held
responsible for them. The present pamph
let is a return of the old failing. It seems
calculated to injure rather than holp the
cause which the people have so much at
heart and for the promotion of which they
expected so much from the old statesman
who in his retirement still retains the
most eloquent voice and pen in England,
and is still be3t fitted to hold the confi
dence of his country and to lead it in a
crisis of this kind.
While in so many respects the pamphlet
"-eems to be unlortunate, it is possible that
just such a bold appeal is necessary to
rouse the Liberals from their indifference
and nerve them to a courage equal to the
ereat crisis which confronts them. It may
be only in seaming that Gladstone has
spoken too rashly. The future may pos
sibly prove that his words were needed,
that his rashness is wisdom and that his
counsel is the best which has been given
Englana at this time. The Czar and Kaiser
will bs indignant in vain if the "old man
eloquent" shall have succeeded in arous
ing the spirit of the liberty-loving people
of Europe.
THE CROP OUTLOOK.
The reports published in Thx Call yes
terday from all counties in California give
promise of abundant harvests during the
coming year. There has been a eood rain
fall in every section of the State, and from
every county comes the announcement
that the prospect for large crops Is better
than the average.
The orchardists and vineyardists, dis
turbed by recollections of the late frosts of
last year, are still some wh.-.t fearful of the
possibility of a similar disaster this season.
There seem, however, to be no good rea
sons for these fears. The continuance of
cold weather through the,winter and ttie
absence of sunshine have caused the tree-i
and vines to be late in blooming and bud
ding, and the condition of the crops there
fore is very different from that of the last
season, when they were blighted by the
frost.
It is gratifying to note there is a much
larger acreage of the State planted to grain
this year than for some tinie past. This
is due of course to the rise in the price of
wheat and the prospect of good prices next
fall. These prospects ire believe will not
prove deceitful. There will of course be
some decline from present prices when
the new crop comes in, but there is littlo
cause for fear that the prices \vill*all as
low as they were last summer and in the
preceding year.
While the report from the State as a
whole shows that something more than an
average yield is expected, there are many
counties where the prospects promise a
record-breaking yield, from these it is
announced that never before in the history
of the State has there been the promise of
such abundant crops of grain and of fruit.
These counties are among the foremost in
the State. Their products constitute the
largest portion of the agricultural output
of California, and since their yield is to be
so much larger than in former years, it is
safe to estimate that for the State as a
whole the output of the coming season
will surpass all previous records.
However it may be in other portions of
the Union, nature in this State is working
in harmony with the new era. The year
which sees a return to legislation favor
able to American industry and the up
building of a home market for the prod
ucts of American farms will see the output
of California farmers far exceed the aver
age yield. We are promised not only
good prices but large crops. The farmers
as well as the workers in the cities w ill
reap benefits froai the coming year. We
may. with sanguine expectation look for
ward to a year of prosperity, and it is
hardly possible that any disaster will in
terfere to prevent its realization.

commit a murder in England and make his

pursued by officers armed with the proper
warrant forhis arrest and they should overtake
the vessel with the man on board the captain
of the vessel on which he was would have to
resuect the warrant, for the reason that tne
accused, being on the deck of an English ves
vol, was on English territory. If the vessel
was in foreign watersâ that is. a foreign
portâ at the time it was reached by
the pursuing vessel, the same proceedings
would have to be taken as were taken in the
case of Butler, who came to this port on the
Swanhilda. There would have to be a demand
for him under the extradition treaty. This
rule applied in the case in 18(50, mentioned in

Great Britain, an individual charged with
murder or attempt to commit murder, piracy,
arson, robbery, forgery and the utterance of
forged paper can be extradited. There is no
question about the right of extradition on the
charge of murder in 1860.

however, a guy rope broke and the big
stern-wheeler slid Lack into her old posi
tion. A little while later the tug Reliance
came along and the Whitelaw signaled to

her for assistance. Captain Brokaw at
once complied and soon after made fast to
the Sunol. When it came to a question of
a long pull and a strong pull and a pull
all together the Sunol came back onto an
even keei. At high water last night she
was pumped out and put on the ' Mission
mud flats.
The stern-wheeler is a complete wreck.
All her deckhouses Are gone and from
;he main deck up nothing is left save
broken timbers. All the lead bars are
gone and when the vessel turned turtle
the boilers brote loose and, crashing
through the deck, went into the bay. The
estimate for placing the vessel in the same
condition as she was in prior to the disas
ter is $10,000, but the chances are that it
will ccs! considerably more tnan that sum
to put her in good running order again.
R. J. R. Aden, Harry Gosdall and A. E.
Pryor paid a visit to lha wreck yesterday
and came to the conclusion that things
might have been worse. Tho hull ot the
vessel is intact and the guard at the point
where the Olympic struck her was barely
cut through.
"It hat not maae a particle of difference
to our business," said Mr. .Pryor yester
day. "We had the Grace Barton ready to
take the Sunol's place, and the travel is
going on the same as usual. We were in
tending to lay the Sunol off for an over
hauling, and now she will get a good one.
However, in about two mon lbs I think you
will see her on the old run again."
The men who have been handling the
freight on the Pacific Mail Company's City
of Sydney have established a new record.
In forty-six hours tney have taken 0ut2316
tons and put 2610 tons of freight into ihe
vessel. Tbe Sydney was late getting in
and ttie work of unloading and loadhig had
to be rushed. When it comes to getting
cargoes in and out in a liurry there are few
people who can hold a candle to Captain
Anderson, superintendent of the dock-, and
jolly "Jim" \Vin?lov of Bingham & Co.,
the stevedores. The Sydney will get away
to-day and will ta fee, besides the ceneral
freight, a deckload of railway cars and
surfboats.
Another expedition to the Southern
Seat is fairly under way. The old whaling
bark Mermaid nas been purchased and
she will take down a party of 150 men
who are after money and fame. At tbe
present time the vessel is in OaK!and
Creek, but in a few days she will be
brought over to this sido and her 'tween
decks will be fitted out with bunks, in
order to accommodate the emigrants.
Captain Alex McLean of sealing fame is
to be master of the bark, and Captain
Quinton, an old South Sea Island trailer,
is to guide the expedition to tbe new Eu
reka. According to him the island is well
wooded with uak, ebony, sandal wood,
rosewood and a large number of valuable
native woods. Oranges, lemous, pine
apples, bananas and all trODical
fruit grow wild, while the taro root and
bread fruit are very aounaant. There are

great herds of wild hogs and goats, plenty
of pigeons and all the fish that the heart
of man can desire. Copper ledges crop
out all over the island, and gold can be
found in the bed of almost every stream.
Coffee, cotton and sugar-cane grow wild
and the c.imaie, nccording to Captain
Quinton, is almost perfect. It averages 80
degress nearly all the year round, but then
the heat is tempered by the Seabreeze,
which blows continuously.
This earthly paradise was discovered by
Captain Quinton when ::s master of the
schooner Equator he was taking Robert
Louis Stevenson around the Southern
seas. The locality will not be disclosed to
any one except members of the expedi
tion.
The intention is to bay a schooner, and
she will follow or lead the Mermaid. The
latter will make regular trips to San Fran
cisco, carrying the products of the island,
while the schooner will be used for trading
purposes among the islands. If all poeÂ«
well the party expects to get away about
the Ist of May.
The American shir William H. Macey
arrived from New York yesterday with
another tale of cruelty on the high seas
aboard. The men assert that the chief
officer abused them terriblyand beat them
with "belaying pins witnout provocation.
The whole story will be told to the United
States District Attorney by the men, who
will go as;;oro to swear to their complaint
to-day.
The steam schooner Alliance, while on
her way from Eureka for San Diego, put
in yesterday to land one of the crew, who
was sick. After landing him at Meiggs
wharf the vessel put to sea again.
The American bark WiUie R. Hume
cot in from Shanghai last Saturday night.
Yesterday morning *he was ordered into
quarantine by Dr. Rosenau. the Federal
quarantine officer. The vessel was in a
filthy condition, and nearly every mem-
I ncr of the crew wns covered with what are
i known as Asiatic boils. Dr. Chalmers,
: the State quarantine officer, was of the
| opinion that it was not necessary to put
the vessel in quarantine and there was a
clash of authority. Finally Captain
: Brown obeyed the orders of tha Federal
ruthority and the vessel was towed over
to Angel Island. There both vessel and
crew will be fumigated, after wiiich the
men will be allowed to land. The Hume

FAKERS BARELY
ESCAPE A JAIL
Judge Morrow Discharged
the Writ, hut Granted
Bail.
The State Supreme Court Is
Upheld by the Federal
Authorities.
Petitioners, by the Court's Decision,
Were R manded Into the
Sheriff's Custody.
"Long Green" Lawrence and Corre
spondent L. L. Levings of ihe Examiner
have escaped the physical if not the moral
consequences of their contempt of the Een
ate throuph a loophole of the law.
A noteworthy poi nt in the latest phase
of the case is the absolute indorsement
given by the Federal court to the State
Supreme Court's decision, holding the
prisoners amenable to an outraged Senate.
Hon. W. W. Morrow, sitting in the Fed
oral District Court, yesterday discharged
the writ of habeas corpus which was
granted last Thursday and remanded the
petitioners Into the custody of the Sheriff
of Sacramento County, but at the same
time admitted them to bail in the sum of
$1000 pending their appeal to the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals or if nec
essary to the Supreme Court of the United
States, ou a writ of error.
It was at once pointed out by District
Attorney J. C. Jones of Sacramento, who
represented the Sheriff in these proceed
ings, that the petitioners would never
suffer the punishment for their contempt
under the court's decision, inasmuch as
the Legislature would adjourn to-morrow
(Saturday). "1 admit," he added, "that
this is- outside the record."
"It is unavoidable," was the court's
brief comment. "This is the law and not
the fault of the court."
The argument on the part of counsel
occupied the entire afternoon, Deputy
Attorney-General Anderson representing
the Benate, G. W. McEnerncy and Charles
J. Heggarty the petitioners Â«nd District
Attorney Jones of Sacramento the Bheriff.
Mr. McEnerney'a contention in support of
tho writ was that the action of the Senate
in imprisoning the petitioners was a vio
lation of tho constitution of ti:e United
States, the fourteenth amendment of
which declared the immunity of citizens
from arrest and imprisonment without
due process of law; that the petitioners
had been imprisoned because they main
tained the right to rely upon that immu
nity which, Mr. McEnerney held, it was
the duty of this court to construe in ex
actly the same manner as the United
States Supreme Court bad construed an
identical provision of the constitution.
He denied that the commitment was a
process of law, nnd described it as null
and void because it neglected to specify
ttie exact nature of the contempt, nor did
it reproduce the questions which it al
leged the petitioners had declined to an
swer. The Sheriff was therefore left with
out proper directions as to wnen he should
release His prisoners, and thereby incurred
the risk of illegal detention.
The Deputy Attorney-G?neral and Dis
trict Attorney Jones combined to nega
tive Mr. McEnerney's argument. The
former maintained it was a universal rule
of the Federal courts that when the high
est State court had pass d upon questions
of law within its jurisdiction, such de
cision should be binding upon the Federal
courts. The only question that the Federal
court could passioly entertain with re
spect to this writ was whether or not the
laws of the State under which the State
courts had held that the Senate had juris
diction were in conflict with these consti
tutional provisions.
He also contended that if the State
courts had not adjudicated the matter
under the settled rule of hab-as corpus,
this court in entertaining the writ could
consider only two questions: First, the
jurisdiction of the Seriate to act, and
Â»econ t, the validity of the process upon
its face. The irregularity of the commit
ment, to which Mr. McEnerney referred,
could not vitiate the authority of that,
document. The full report of the ques
tions ;isked by the committee could be
foun<l among the records oi the Senate.
Judge Morrow in rendering his decision,
which included the citation of numerous
authorities, held that whan matters of
this nature bad been determined by the
State courts, the proper recourse of the,
petitioners was to appeal to the Supreme*
Court of the United States.
"It is not a proper proceeding," said be,
"for the District or Circuit courts to r<
view cases occurring in the State courts
where those courts have jurisdiction.
This beine the case, without going into
the merits of the question or considering
the objections raised, 1 think I am au
thorized under the decisions X have quoted ,
to bold that the writ of habeas corpus
should be discharged and that the peti
tioners should be allowed to pursue their
remedy by those other methods indicated
in these decisions. The writ of habeas
corpus will, therefore, bÂ» discharged, and
the petitioners remanded into the custody
of the Sheriff 6f Sacramento."
Mr. McEnerney subsequently gave no
lice of his intention to appeal, and the
petitioners were admitted to bail in the
meantime.
Simply Fighting for Time.
SACRAMENTO, Cat.., March 19.â 1t is
generally understood by the members of
the Senate that the persistent and repeat
ed attempts of the two Examiner attaches
to be released from custody under habeas
corpus proceedings are put forth simply
to fight a ainst time in the hope that the
Legislature will adjourn without taking
steps to provide for their confinement
after that body dies.
As there is notuing of a vindictive char
acter in the course the Senate has pursued
in this matter, it will probably consider
the punishment to whicn the two con
tumacious witnesses have been already
subjected as sufficient, and will take no,
further steps looking to their imprison
ment.
The result of such inaction will be that
should the prisoners be again remanded,
which is highly probable, they will likely
secure their release when the Legislature
has adjourned by a petition for a new writ
of habeas corpus declaring that they are
ready to purge themselves of contempt
and that there is no legal representative
of the Senate to whom they can give the
answers which they originally refused to
make. .

FOUGHT FOR HIS LIFE.
An Armen an Watchman Has a
Desperate Struggle With
Burglars.
Admits 'He Was Afraid, but Ap
â¢a-ently He Mads an Effect
iv.> Resistance.
Vahan Azhterian is a young Armenian,
who bas been away from his own troubled
country out a few months yet i* doubtful
if in the land terrorized by the unspeaka
ble Turk be had any more desperate en
counters than the one he engaged in with
two burglars early yesterday morning.
Azhterian is employed as salesman dur
ing the day and as night watchman for
Paul Conriau, the proprietor of a Turkish
rug establishment in the building at 317
Powell street, for merly the quarters of the
Cosmos Club. About 3 o'clock yesterday
morning the Armenian was awakened by
a strange noise in an adjoining room. He
started to investigate, but had barely left
his sleeping apartment when he was con
front-d by two strange men.
"I was much sleepy," said the Arme
nian, in describing the affair, "and I was
a. so afraid. I fired my revolver, and then
one of the men hit me with the end of his
pistol, and putting it dose to me, fired
once. Then they ran away."
The young man has two painful scalp
wounds and a severe powder burn as the
result of his adventure. He was also suf
fering greatly from the shock yesterday.
A bundle |of valuable robes, which the
burglars had prepared to carry away, was
found.

NO PAY FOR PINKERTONS.
Finauce Commutes Refuse* to Audit a
Bill for Detective Work.
The Finance Committee ol tbe Board of
Supervisors refused yesterday to audit a
bill for detective services contracted by
tbe Grand Jnry while conducting its in
vestigation into the affairs of tbe Gqiden
Gate Park management.
The bill was for six days' work by a
Pinkerton detective, which, with ex
penseg, including liquid refreshments,
brought tbe amount up to $31 50.
The committee refused to r< commend
the payment of tbe demand because no
authority had been piven to contract such
indebtedness, and that the regular detec
tives of the Police Department could have
done tbe work just as well.

The Salvation Army Congress, which is

commander on the present standing of
the army.
"The present standing of the army," he
said, "compared both financially and in
numbers with that of a year ago, is very
encouraging. At that time 2000 officers
were enli3ted, but now there are 2300
officers and the ranks have proportionately
increased. The number of our converts
yearly amounts to the exceedingly start
ling ngures of JX),000 souls.
"It was universally reported that 250
officers had retired from our London
branch on account of personal feelings ex
isting ; gainst the management, but such
is not the case. The army was never on a
more harmonious basis than at the pres
ent time."

FOOD COFFEE.
A CLIPPING
For Those Who Talk to the Public.
The following comments on advertising
made by the advertisement wriier for the
Postum Cereal Co., Lim., of Battle Creek,
Mich., may interest some who have been
attracted by the rather unique article
fiofh his pen :
"Make ud the stories? whyâ yes, to be
sure they are dressed and trimmed some,
but they are all lounded upon fact.
"That is, for instance, a mail-carrier,
clerk, lawyer, or what not with whom I
may be talking, tells me his experience
with 'Postum.'
"His siory, possibly, is long enough for
two columns of solid matter if reported
verbatim.
"I take the main facts and boil down
the talk until we can afford to run it as a
pleasant bit of shop talk with our friends
and customers (the public) and not bank-
rupt v*. I always stick to the facts, as I
consider that when a man advertises he
simply talks to customers, ana if he lies
in Ills advertisements lie will lie in the
face to face cnats.
"Tell the truth, it i 3 more fascinating
than all the romances one can spin up.
"When you write an advertisement try
and look upon yourself as conversing with,
or explaining to, some one who wants to
know about the article you have to sell. ,
They are interested, and they want to
know how near your goods will fit their
needs.
"Tell them as plainly as possible, with-
out exaggeration or subterfuge, just what
you have and leave them to judge whether
they want it or nut. Don't tell them to
: buy this' or 'eat that.'
"Tho Dnblic know about what they
want to do. and the duty of the 'ad.'
writers is to explain facts in an easily un-
derstood way
"First be sure you have an article of
true merit, then tell the people about it.
Tell them the truth and you add a goodly
percentage of dignity and character to
your business and to the product you are
furnisuing."
Wily grocers sometimes work in cheap

customer will stand it.

MELANGE OF SPORT.
The Great Bicycle Tournament â Oar, Gun,
Rod and Bat.
Now that the pugilistic championship
contest is over, the sporting fraternity
will turn its fitention to other lines of
amusement. Baseball and wheeling are
doing well and these lines of athletic pas
time will have a brilliant summer. The
great indoor tournament which will com
mence this evening at the Pavilion is the
absorbing talk among the devotees ol
cycling. The fastest riders in this State
are numbered among the entrants. Judg
ing from the present appearance of things,
there will be larpe gatherings of people at
the Pavilion during trie tournament.
The anglers are getting ready for the
opening of the trout - fishing season.
Sportsmen are having a gala time at the
traps Â»nd the coursing enthusiasts are
highly elated over the big events that will
taice place in the near future. Lovers of
rifle-shooting will be well represented to
morrow at the ranges.
THE WHEELMEN.
Everything in Readiness for the
Opening of the Indoor Tour
nament To-Night.
.From cycling to pugilism and back
again to cycling. There is a vast differ
ence between the two sports, and I must
frankly confess that I greatly prefer the
wheeling diversion. Not but what box
ing is a great sport, and the Carson trip,
its incident* and scenes, are likely never
to be forgotten. But somenow the follow
ing was so different. The men were older
and more "sporty" looking. One missed
the "youth and beauty" of the cycle
meets.
There were cyclers there, however, a
JAY EATON, the World's Champion Indoor Rider.
considerable number of them. The cold
weather was conducive to the wearing of
sweaters, and some of them sported em
blems. There were two Bay Cities, one
Reliance, one Acme, sixteen Olympic
Wheelmen, and twelve Olympic Cyclers
that I actually saw and counted for the
curiosity of it. There may have been
others, but they wore coats and overcoats
which nid the distinguishing emblem*.
I come back to find the great indoor
tournament almost ready to be opened,
and all the preliminary arrangements in
splendid shape. Jay Eaton, the cham
pion indoor professional rider of the world,
is here, and Fritz Lacey, the champion
amateur of Southern California. The big
team which has been quartered at San
Jose came up yesterday, and the riders
are said to be in fine fettle.
The track was almost completed last
night, and is a beaut) 7 . One El well can
now thoroughly disabuse his mind of the
idea that he is the only man in California
who can construct a scientifically fast and
safe bicycle track. This track is eight laps
to the mile, banked six feet oh the ends
â  and eighteen inches on the stretches. It
is made of boards, laid lengthwise, and is
wide enough for four men to safely fight
out a race any time.
The Pavilion seating arrangements have
undergone a marveious change. The di
rectors of the big building have for some
time been negotiating with an Eastern
house to supply them with a patent chair
seat. These have just arrived and were
being put in position last night. They
are roomy and comfortable and a great
improvement over anything had there be
fore.
Manager Shafer is much pleased with
the progress that has been made in every
â  thing. He Knows a good or a poor track
when he sees one, and he immediately
stamped his approval on the one con
structed in the Pavilion. If it had not
been safe and fast he would not have al
lowed it to be completed until it was made
so.
Mayor Phelan has agreed to open the
tournament by starting the first race.
'The popular Mayor is an ardent wheelman
himself and his official sanction of the
meet, as it were, is certainly flattering to
the promoters. Blanchard's military band
has been engaged and can be made of con
siderable service and entertainment dur
ing the running and intermissions.
The following is a partial list of officials
who will serve:
Referee, Robert M. Welch; judgesâ Frank H.
Kerrigan, Charles Albert Adams, J. M. Ham
ilton, A. P. Swain, Frank W. Fuller, A. W.
Webe; timersâ Georpe P. Wetmore, George H.
Stratum, J. F. McGlynn, Edwin Mohrig;
scorersâ Will Pixley, C. R. Coulter, D. Conk
ling; cleric of course, George K. Dixon; as
sistantsâWalter Geldert, Joseph Lewis, C. P.
Jarman, N. A. Robinson; umpiresâ J. S. Eean,
Howard Smith, Max Mayer, J. F. Brown;
starter, Robert C. Lennie; announcer, Wilbur
F. Knur p.
It will be noted that these officers are all
prominent in local wheeling circles, and
the fact that they will act is a sufficient
guarantee of the meet for the riders and
the public. The entire amount of prize
money has been put up, the prizes aggre
gating in value $9000, largely in cash, as
most of the events will be for profes-
eionala.
Tbe programme lor to-night â entries,
heats and bandicans â was given in The
Call yesterday. There was no lack of
entries for the tournament. The one
amateur race to be run to-night was so
filled that it had to be divided into nine
beats, which will necessitate semi-finals
before the final. It is a one-mile handi
cap. The one-mile scratch, professional,
and the five-mile invitation, professional,
will be hot events, as they bring together
some of the crack riders of the country.
Then there is the five-mile club cup race,
which is to be a feature of every evening
during the tournament, and which will
be the source 01 considerable warm parti
sanship, as such events always are.
The management has made a wise move
in placing the admission at popular
prices, and the construction of the rrack
makes almost any location in the big
building good. Tfie meet will draw an
immense crowd, particularly the opening
night, to-night.
W. C. Pelot, who witnessed every Na
tional circuit tournament last season,
speaks of the outlook for the sport this
year as follows:
"The indications are that the racing
season of '97 will be one of small teams,
fast racing, c'ean work on the part of the
riders and a general revival in racing in
all parts of the country. From the pres
ent appearance the sport will never get so
strong that it can stand on its own feet
without aid from the manufacturers.
This was proved by the cancellation of
dales all along tha National circuit last
year until a team was sent out from Chi
cago."
Edwin E. Stoddard of the Bay City
Wheelmen has returned from an ex
tended business trip through the North
west and Joseph A. Ostendorf of the same
club is back from a journey through
Northern California. Dan O'Callaghan
got back from Carson City Thursday.
Captain Argenti has arranged a picnic
run of the Camera Club Cyclists for to
morrow to the country res dence of E. G.
Zeile, near Haywards. Members and
friends will take the 8:30 a. m. broad
gauge ferry and local train to Fruitvale,
thence wheel to destination and are re
quested to brin > luncheon. The distance
from Fruitvale is only thirteen miies and
many who went on tnis run last year and
remember the enjoyable time had will no
doubt take it again to-morrow.
Fritz G. Lacey of Los Angeles arrived
here from Los Angeles yesterday morn
ing and will tate part in all the amateur
events at the Pavilion indoor tournament,
and also ride on the Bay City Wheelmen's
relay team. This will make the third suc
cessive year he has been on 'bis team.
Lacey is one of the crack amateur riders
of the State.
The Bay City Wheelmen will hold a ten
mile "try-out" over the Fruitvale-Hay
wards course to-morrow at 2 p. h. There
will be a club run by the 9 a. m. broad
gauge boat to witness it.
The Reliance Club Wheelmen will hold
a similar event in the forenoon, and popu
lar Captain Myrick will take a large dele
gation of members down the road to see
the boys ride. The Reliance team will be a
potent factor in the coming relay race.
Down San Jose way the Garden City Cy
clers will test the speed of some of their
new men at ten miles. The club asserts
positively that it will enter a relay team
this year. Spaldinq.
ROWING.
The Pioneer Rowing Club Will Hold
a Series of Races To-Nlor
row.
Doubtless a large crowd of people who
are interested in rowing will witness a se
ries of races that have been arranged by
the Pioneer Rowing Club for Sunday
next. A beautiful silver cap is offered as
a prize, and the following crews will con
test:
First heatâ Fred Orr (captain), J.Con
nolly, G. Darrah, J. Klunder; G. Collopy
(captain), D. Leahy, 11. S. Crowley, R.
Coilapy.
Second heatâ W. St. John (captain ), W.
C. Espy, R. J. Espy, Phil Tuits; O. Ochs
(captain), T. Faulkner, M. Calnan, T.
Bands.
The final heat will be rowed on the fol
lowing Bunday.
On last Sunday morning four barge
crews left the boathouse end rowed over
the regular three-mile course. The crews
were under the care of Captain Thomas.
It is his intention to continue this work
every Sunday morning from now on until
about two weeks prior to the carnival re
gatta, when the crews will settle down to
t be regular daily practice.
A crew composed of T. Fitzpatnck
stroke, Hugh M. Isaac after waist, Joe
Campodonico forward waist and M. Tier
nans bow, rowed to the Dolphin boathouse
on Saturday afternoon. On the home
ward journey they had a lively race with
Captain Dan Haskell of the tog Fearless
and succeeded in reaching Folsom-street
pier about one hundred yards ahead of
the well-known mariner.
Tom Lynch met with an accident last
Sunday morning which he is not liable to
forget for some time to come. It was
Mr. Lynch's first experience at skiff
rowing, and instead of remaining in the
quiet and peaceful waters of China Basin
he ventured far out into the stream,
where his boat was upset and he was
thrown into the water. Mr. Lynch wisely
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 20, 1897.
held on to the boat and cried for help.
His cries were beard by Frank Burke and
Archie Campbell, who had been visiting
the Oregon in a Whitehall boat. They
immediately went to the rescue and suc
ceeded in landing him safely at the boat
house. With the exception of a slight
cold Mr. Lynch is none the worse for his
experience.
A party composed of Frank Reichling,
William Mead, J. Malherne, James
Feehan and several friends visited the
Oregon on Sunday morning. Mr. Reich
ling, with his camera, took several views
oi the famous battle-ship, whicli he in
tends to present to the club as soon as
they are developed.
Frank Duplissea. Ed Scully, George
Bates, Tom Barry, Joe ODea, George Fox
and Jim Foley were out skiff-rowing last
Sunday morning.
John Maboney and James Pallas will
represent the club in the junior shell race
durinz the conning season. Charlie Cutter
and Walter Duplissea are also thinking
seriously of purchasing shells and carry
ing off some of the carnival medals.
The long-looked-for baseball game be
tween the South End boys and the
Dolphins will be played to-morrow after
noon at the Presidio grounds. Both
teams are in excellent iorm, and a close
and interesting game is expected. The
admission will be 25 cents; ladies free.
The proceeds will go the unemployed
fund. All the players will report at the
Dolphin boathouse at 12:30 o'clock, and
after dressing will row to the grounds.
The game will commence promptly at 2
r. m.
The Dolphin outrigger skiff men are be
ginning to train for their race in Mny.
Altx Pape, T. M. Ferguson, Charles Far
r-'ll. Will Patch, T. R. Ktenan and John
Coughlin are the preset) i entries. Sunday
was the first trial Ferguson had, and he
tried to pull the boa: to pieces. Captain
Patch will have him train in a Whitehall
so a* not to strain the boats before the
race.
Pape has rowed so long in a Whitehall
that he finds it difficult' to acquire the
knack of handling a sikiing-seat boat.
The rest of the entriesâ Patch, Keenan,
Farrell and Coughlin â have been rowing
for some time, and they only need to cul
tivate their wind. A crew composed of
Will Patch, stroke; Tim Hopkins, after
waist; J. J. Cronin, forward waist, and
Lith Duncan, with G. K. Sullivan, rowed
out through the Golden Gate Sunday
morning in their race barge, accompanied
Dy Aiex Pape in an outrigger skiff. In
the afternoon the six-oared barge Wie
land carried a crew composed of Charles
Farrell, stroke; T. J. Kennedy, No. 5;
J. J. Cronin, No. 4; James Laib, No. 3;
Lith Duncan, No. 2; Charles Roach, bow,
and Adam Schuppert, cockswain, with
Captain Patch, guest, and rowed to Sausa
lito and Tiburon.
Al Shields and Al Baib with a party of

Part of .the Alerts play in this team.
Handball enthusiasts crowded the San
Francisco court yesterday afternoon, the
attractions being a single-handed gam*
between ex-Alderman James Dunne of
New York and John Riordan, the cham
pion of the coast.
The New YorK veteran expressed a de
sire to meet the best man on the coast,
and the match was arranged with Rior
dan.
Among the spectators were J. C. Nealon,
P. T. Donnelly, the amateur champion;
T. F. Bonnet, M. J. Kilgallbn, J. Harlow,
Joe Lawless, Al Hampton, R. Linehan, J.
J. Feeny and every hand ball- player of
note in the City.
The difference physically between the
two players was striking. Riordan is tall
and tbin and sinewy, while tne ex-Alder
man, who is 65 years of age, has an ath
letic frame of fine proportions.
The match was the best of five games
and the tirst was a rattler. The play was
fast and it was nip and tuck from start to
finish. The veteran won the game by 21
to 20. The second game was a cinch for
the veteran, who won by 21 to 2. Itior
dan pulled himself together and won the
third by 13 to 21. The fourth was won by
the veteran by 21 to 7, and be was loudly
cheered by the spectators.
Tne following was the score:
Dunne 21 21 13 21
KlorJan 20 U 21 7
Sunday afternoon the veteran will play
a single-handed game against T. F. Bon
net, by special request, as Bonnet's ad
mirers think he can give the veteran more
bard work than any other player.
THE YACHTSMAN.
The Drawbridge at Tiburon Opens
To- Morrow.
To-morrow the drawbridge at the month
of the lagoon at Tibnron will be raised and
all the yachts will be taken from their
winter quarters and will be put in order
for the season.
It Is expected that tbe members of the
Corinthian Yacht Club will be out in fall
force as this is one of the principal events
of tbe season at Tiburon.
The Nixie, the flagship of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club, is on Stone's ways be
ing prepared for the season. She has been
planed off aboye the water line and the
interior undergo a change.
The Clara, the flagship of the Corinth
ians, occupies the ways next to the Nixie.
Commodore Youne is hard at work with
his crew putting t,er into first-class order.
Three feet have been cut from the foot of
the must, new planking has been put on
above the water line and she bus been
thoroughly scraped and overhauled gen
erally.
Last Sunday the Pride of the Bay came
down from Turner's Bay at Benicia, and
presented a very fine appearance as she
sailed into the harbor.
Robert Englebrecht of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club intends to build a 30
--footer to com Dei c for the McDononghcup.
It is very likely she will be furnished with
a fen keel.
The Amego, formerly the Globe, has
had her mast stepped two and a half feet
forward. It it expected that this change
will greatly improve her saiiing.
A race has been arranged between the
Villain, t:.e new fen keel, built by Captain
Turner, and the Phoenician, Captain R. R.
L'Hommedieu. The loser will provide a
French dinner for eight.
The race is to be sailed as soon as Cap
tain Turner brings the Villain down from
Benicia.

The score was 7to 2. It was a clean, neat

SACRAMENTO, CaL., March 18. â Game
Warden Helms reports that canvasback, red
head and blue bili ducks are very plentiful in
this locality Jat the present time, I and Â£ the
chances are that | a larger number of these
ducks will nest around here this season than
ever before known. This is directly traceable
to the efficient protection afforded the birds
during I the past" two years by this energetic
official, who has - become a terror to I the vio
lators of the game law in this vicinity, and nas
a personal record of more arrests and convic
tions than any other game officer in the State.
Being a thorough sportsman his whole 'heart
is bound up in he prompt performance of his
duty, which he carries out without fear or
favor . and at a total disregard of . personal
danger. â , â . v Â-â ..- â  '::..:â  . .-..-. â Â- -r- . â â¢--.. -
: The greatest violators of the law In this lo
cality are the Portuguese and Italians, who
live down in the tule districts. These people
kill ducks all the year round and heretofore
have defied the law and its officers, and have ,
made frequent threats to kill any of the latter
who attempted to make any arrests. Helms,
however, has demonstrated that he wÂ«s as
good a shot as any of them, and would have
no hesitancy in shooting in self-protection.
He has frequently made arrests in their midst, 1
and his utter fearlessness in doing so has put
a stop to the killing of game out of season. ;
Helms reports that the black bass and perch
which he planted in the chain of lakes below
the city- are doing well. Some time 'since/
while screening one of the lakes, several of
the perch and bass were caught r and returned

UNEMPLOYED BUSY
ON THE BOULEVARD
The Beautiful Driveway
Is Rapidly Being
Built.
The Managers Wish the Public
to Visit It to See What
Is Done.
There Is No Shirking of Work ani
All the Hen Are Honest y Earn- â¢'
ing Their Dollar a Day.
The problem of the unemployed Is
being to a very laree extent solved by the
success of the plan to give them work on
the big boulevard, which is being opened
up from the Golden Gate Park to Ingleside
road. A representative of Thi Call vis
ited the ground-; yesterday afternoon and
found 188 men hard at work, and William
M. Bunker, chairman of the general com
mittee, say a there will be from titty to
seventy-five additional hands there to
day.
Not only are the most deserving men
and those most in need being given an op
portunity to earn a dollar a day, but a
splendid driveway is being rapidly con
structed, which will when finished be a
very valuable addition to the City's at
tractions. The men are so diligently at
work that there is no question about their
earning the wages, and San Francisco
will get the full worth of every dollar ex
pended in this benevolence.
The management of the funds and su
perintendence of the work is so thoroughly
systematized there is no chance for any
waste. The plan is for every dollar of the
donations to go to the unfortunate men
who have been unemployed, and the shov
els, wheelbarrows, axes, lumber, etc., have
all been furnished gratis. The very im
portant item of directing the work is ob
tained free of cost, ana it appears that San
Francisco is getting a great bargain in hav
ing this beautiful drive constructed so
economically.
One of the gangs of men was busily cut
ting a bundred-foot swath through the
pine forest, another was grabbing up big
trees by tbe roots, another down in the
mud and water was digging a trench for
the great 42-inch iron pipe which is being
placed under that portion of the road they
are now grading. A large number were
tearingdown hills, while tneir companions
wheeii-d the dirt away to fill in ravines,
and there wai no indication anywhere of
slow and slouchy work.
Juhi. McCord, the chairman of the con
struction committee, drives out to the
grounds every forenoon to push the work
alone and then returns to work for tbe
good cause in the City. He also furnishes
a horse and buggy for the nse of the sup
erintendent. The fact that he is also
chairman of the Boulevard and Driving
Association makes his knowledge and
assistance of great advantage to the carry
ing through of the design.
Chairman William M. Bunker gives his
personal attention to the operations, and
is out on the grounds every day and all
day. He has had a large experience in
this kind of work, as lie was chairman of
tbe construction committee three years
ago when the unemployed earned under
his dirceiion $93,000 in developing the
park. His familiarity with superintend
ing large pangs of workmen so as to get
tbe best results from their labor excludes
any likelihood of there being any waste
through idleness or ill-planned methods
of work.
Chairman Banker says they now hare
about $9000 in round nnm bars on band,
and as the policemen, Custom-bouse era
.ployes and others have promised gener
ous contributions he thinks there may be
$15,000 in sigut. But this ia not one-third
enough to complete tne boulevard, and
the army of men seeking is increasing
so rapidly that the present fund will soon
be exhausted. Those who have the mat
ter in charge earnestly desire that the
attention of the public should be called to
what is being done and to the need of
more money, both as a charity and as a
benefit to the City.
The most careful scrutiny is eiven to
every application for a job, and oniy those
in the most urgent need and most deserv
ing ofassistance are given the tickets that
admit them to the working force.
The work will be so far extended by to
night that those who go for an outing on
Snnday afternoon would do well to drive
by and see what is being done. At the
suggestion of ex- Mayor Kllert, a way was
opened yesterday by which vehicles can
get to the scene of the men's labors. The
managers are desirous of having the
people come out and see for themselves
what hart work is being done, and also
what a handsome driveway the City will
have as a result of this charity. A view
of it, they are confident, would produce
many more liberal donation*.
About the beauty of the boulevard there
can be no question. It is intended to con
nect the new drive with the lnglesida
road, and this will be widened and im
proved without cost by the work of the
300 men who are now idle in the House of
Correction. Down the lovely Ingleside
road the drivers can pass through ave
nues of tall trees, and thence out to the
broad boulevard on the ocean beach and
return home through the main driveway
of the Golden Gate Park. The whole cir
cle will be about aixteen milÂ«a, and it
would be hard to find anywhere in the
world such a combination ol attractions
for a two hours' spin. It will take in all
the beauties of the park, and pass through
a strip of country with alternate hills and
valleys, and then traverse four miles
along the surf.
After much deiay and many fruitless
conferences ex- Mayor ? Sutro has
signed the deeds to the portion vof the
land he donates for the construction of the
new boulevard. Meetings were s held al
most every day during the PÂ«* week, and
Sutro promised ion each occasion tto amx
his aignature Ton i the I morrow, bathe in
variably found some excuse s for I delay,
until it looked as though the matter won d
fall through. â  The ? signature 3 was finally
obtained yesterday a ('* rnoo^ every point
demanded by the ex- Mayor being allowed.

bis willingness to take her to the flat

she was opposed to the marriage, but
parental influence prevailed.

AT LONG ODDS
Pat Reidy Landed Her First
at Odds of ioo
to i.
The Crowd at Emeryville Suf
fered Several Reverses
Yesterday.
May R L?d Her Field Oat in the
Opening Dash at 20 to Iâ Road.
warmer First at 20 to 1.
The fifth erent on the card at Emery
ville yesterday was a mile run under sell
ing conditions, with a email field of four
from which to pick a winner. Among
ihe entries was the mare Miss Ruth, which
won on Tuesday at odds of 25 to L It
looked as though she had as much chance
of beating Benaruela and Salisbury as a
mpsquito has of fanning an elephant to
sleep with a right-band cross counter, and
the ring finally boosted her odds to 100
to .1. Small $2 and $5 bets were then
passed up to the bookmakers, which they
dropped into ihe "take" boxes as cigar
money, thouEii they did eventually rub
the price to 60 to 1.
>The talent were down on Benamela at
<lds of 3 to 5 and 7 to 10, with stable
money cutting the odds against Salisoury
from.ll, to 5 to 8 to 5.
How tne despised outsider won will al
ways remain one of those unfathomable
conundrums of racing. The quartet ran
bunched until nearing the bend for the
â wire, where Miss Ruth pulled away and
actuaiiy won easing up from the odds-on
choice iq tne slow time of 1:43. Frank
Jaubert'took the show from the faint
hearted Salisbury. With few exceptions
nearly every book iv the ring lost to the
race.
â Of the five events decided first choices
succeeded in getting away with three.
The attendance was augmented by quite
a number of returning sports from Car
son ana the betting was about the belt of
tbe week. The track, while good, was
not favorable to fast time.
Burns tt Waterhouse pressed the limit
hy entering the good colt Osric II in the
second race, a six-furlong selling sprint,
for $300 and suffered a boost in conse
quence.
Oh ila"rch 11 O3ric was easily disposed
of by Etta H ana Lost Girl, but yesterday
starting equal choice in the betting with
Etta II he came from the far rear and
beat that mare cleverly after she had
killed off the sky-rocket. Scotch Rose.
Cash Sloan had the mount on tbe Flam
beau mare yesterday, and he had a good
bet down on hor chances as well, while on
March 11 he backed Osric. Cash did not
relisn this invigorating and exhilarating
improvement la form and bid Osric up to
$SOO, tue stable retaining him with the
customary $5 bid.
Among the other long-priced winners
were May R, which captured the opening
event backed down from 20 to 1, and
Koad warmer, winner of the closing scram
ble, also as good as 20 to 1 in the betting.
The fourteen selling-platers gave Starter
Ferguson considerable trouble at the bar
rier in the opening five and a half furlong
scramble. Scarborough was a 2 to 1 fa
vorite, 'with a strong play, cutting the j
oddr*gainst May R, with but 86 pounds
up, down irom 20 to 10. Chappie, away
I weli, raced Zooiein off his feet and looked
a winner into the stretch. Little Wood
tnen got up with May R and in a close
finish got the verdict by a very short head.
The tavorife was away poorly and never
had a chance.
Burns' &, Waterhouse captured the four
furlongd&sh for two-year-olds with their
dapper-looking Salvatorcolt, Colonel Dan, I
whrch opened a7to 5 choice. A warm tip
on Estro brought his price down from 11

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. MARCH 20, 1897.
to 5 to 8 to 5, shading him to the post
oqual favorite with the Colone!. Koxey
Murphy showed in front to the streicl).
wheu the Colonel toot up tbe running and
won handily in 49% seconds. Los Prietos
drew out of the ouncb, taking the place
from Chas. Le Bel, a 20 to 1 shot.
The fourtu event on the programme
was a seven-furlong purse affair, with
nine starters facing the barrier. Hohen
zollern came out a 3 to 2 favorite, and won
under double wraps a head before True
Blue, which colt kept him close company
t roughout the journey. Don Clarencio
drew away from the bunrii at tne pad
dock, finishing in tnird position. Stentor,
the second choice, was slow to get in mo
tion, never getting near the front.
Sallie Clicquot was looked upon as a cer
tainty for the linal five and a naif furlong
spin, and her friends slashed the short
odds of 1 to 2 down to 2 to 5 in short or
der. They were doomed to disappoint
ment, for Roadwarmer. a '20 to 1 shot,
backed down to 10, led Green Morris'
mare from the jump, and at the wire
downed her a neck in l:08Â»4. Midas, a 25
to 1 shot, was a poor third.
NOTES.
The judges are entirely too indifferent
to the practice . indulged in by several
jockeys of beating horses over the head
with their whips. It does not add any
picturesqueness to the sport, and if some
of the fair-headed brats who are addicted
to it were treated to the same dose it
would probably be found that they and
not the horses were responsible for delays
at trie post.
Mr. Ferguson and his little red recall
flag can't seem to work in harmony.
There was one good breakaway in the
two-year-old race yesterdayâ much better,
in fact, than the final startâ but it did not
favor one or two horses in particular, and
the flag called them bace.
Again in the fourth race there was to all
outward appearances a splendid break
[ away, but down came the little piece of
red bunting and the field came back.
' Another delay, and then a start that
I suited the backers of Hobenzoliern.
When horses are sent to the post starters
I are supposed to show no favoritism, though
in this country, where the sport has de
: generated to a gamble, such has not al
ways been the rule.

COLORED HERCULES
Robert Armstrong Is Ready
to Fight Any Heavy-
Weight
Jimmy Barry, the Champion
Bantam, Is Also Looking
for a Match.
Bob Fitzsimmons ard Manager Martin
Julian Wi 1 Reach This City
Eirly This Morning.
There is no hope for those unfortunates
who are already satiated with right talk.
EOB ARMSTRONG, the Heavy-Weight Fighter Who Aspires to
Championship Honors, and CHARLES E DAVIES (the
"Parson "), Who Is Managing / the Colored Giant.
They will have to listen to the whole
thing over and over again to the exclusion
of every other topic so long as the sports
keep dropping into town from the scene
of the late "fight of the century. "
Charles E. Davies, "the Parson," Bat
Masterson ana Wyatt Earp are among the
latest arrivals of prominence.
Davies, the suave gentleman who has
earned a world-wide reputation as the
manager of athletic and pugilistic stars,
has come here not so much to tale about
Fitzsimmons or Corbett as to introduce
two fighters from whom he expects great
r-turns.
Bat Mastcrson, the man who led the po
iice force at the Carson arena, is here
simply on a pleasure jaunt, and may in a
fsw weeks start out with the Fitzsimmons
contingent on a theatrical tour.
Wyatt Earp, whose rank decision in the
Fitzsirumons-iSharkey contest some
months ago added another shingle to the
roof of his unenviable notoriety, baa
come here to report on duty as the "ex
clusive" bodyguard of Long Green Law
rence. Earp is minus his overcoat, which
was stolen from dim in Carson on the day
oi the light.
The two proteges of Parson Davies are
Bob Armstrong and Jimmy Barry. The
former is a colored man 22 years of age,
who weighs 190 pounds and stands 6 feet
'6% inches in h:-< stockings. He is a won
derlul human structure, built on the same
nies as Peter Jackson, whom beresembles
â ireatly in features. He is not *o clever as
Peter, but he is shifty and is apt in learn
ing. Davies is anxious to get a match on
(or Armstrong In this City.
The list of eligible heavy-weights in this
part of the country is not very promising,
as Van Buskirkand Jeffries are as good as
booked already. Armstrong, however, is
willing to wait for the winner of that en
gagement or he will take on Stelzner or
even Goddard, Maher, O'Donnell, Corbett
or Fitzsimmons.
As Steve O'Donnell has declared him
se;f already that he will not tight a colored
man and Fizsirumons will not ac&in
enter the prize ring, Armstrong appears to
uaveaDoor show of getting tried out in
California or Nevada.
"I have my return ticket, however, and
1 can wait out here for six months," said
Parson Daviea yesterday. "If I can't get
a pood purse here I'll take Armstrong
back to New York and I can put him up
against some one there."
Davies is n loser 10 the extent of nearly
$1000 on Corbett, but he takes his loss
pleasantly ns he taps his hand on the
pocket wherein lies his retusn ticket
home.
"I was disappointed in Corbett," be
said. "I thought he would put up a bet
ter fight. The thing is that be was over-
trained. He trained as he did in his fieht
with Sullivan and he did not have the
vitality to stand the strain. In a return
match with fitzsimmons and with the
right training 1 believe that Jim would be
the victor."
The second card Parson Daviea has to
play is Jimmy Barry, the champion ban
tam. The little fellow weighs 105 pounds
and is considered a world-beater. There
is but one man in his class in this State
who has any license to meet tne Easterner
with a hope of success, and that is An
thony, tbe little Australian, who has been
here for some months and who has so far
been unable to secure an engagement.
Bob Fitzsimmons, Martin Julian and
the remainder of that clique will reach
the City this morning and inaugurate a
series of exhibitions that will eventually
develop into a protracted tour of the
Eastern States.
Jim Corbett, Billy Brady and Harry
Corbctt were around yesterday meeting
their friends and sympathizers.
"You may state tnis," Harry Corbett
said in answer to an inquiry. "Jim is still
confident that he can whip Fitzsimmons,
and we have $25,000 ready to put up as a
side wager as soon as the match is made."
Harry Corbett paid off the last tickets
sold in his poolrooms in this City and
Carson yesterday afternoon. He paid out
$108,800 that had been placed with him
here, and $88,000 that had been placed
with him in Carson, where the firm's
name was Corbett & Coleman.
Want an Amendment.
The Board of Health nas requested the
Board of, Supervisors to amend| order 1601 bo
as to provide that all pÂ«rsons shall connect
their stables or stalls where horses are kept
by a cement or ironstone pipe with the sewer
oi the street near which the same is situated,
so that the building may be kept in a clean
and wholesome condition.
OBJECT TO THE BOULEVARD.
The Teamsters' Union Wants Van Mess
Avenue Opened Fur Heavy Traffic.
The Draymen and Teamsters' Union has
petitioned the Board of Supervisors to repeal
the order made some time ago declaring Van
Ness avenue from Market street to Lewis
street to be a boulevard, and prohibiting the
passage of heavy teams over the thoroughfare.
The union contends that the avenue has
b:-en and is now the only thoroughfare
for traffic between the water front nnd the
Presidio. Fulton Iron Works, Lombard street,'
the gas works and Black Point. Tbe union
states in its communication thntin some East
ern cities the nAiber of boulevards over
which heavy traffic Is prohibited is restricted
to two, and these are only declared when they
connect with some public park. Attention is
called to the fact that Van Ness avenue con
nects with no park.
Lenten Services.
To-morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock the third
of the series of Lenten services, under the
auspices of tbe Calvarian Society, will be held
at St. Mary's Cathedral. Rev. J. j. PrenJer
gast will deliver the sermon on the "Third
Word": "When Jesus, therefore, hftd seen his
mother and the disciple standing, whom he
loved, said to his mother, 'Woman, behold
thy son!" After that he saith to the disciple,
'Behold thy mother!' And from that hour the
disciple took her to his own home." The
usual services consist of the "Way of the
Cross," a sermon and benediction of the
blessed sacrament.
Attorney Loug Defended.
Attorney Eugene N. Deuprey appeared in
Judge Wallace's court yesterday morning and
made a statement on behalf ot Attorney Jtmcs
H. Long, who was criticized because it was
alleged that ha bad deserted a -client on the
eve of his trial. Mr. Deuprey explained that
Mr. Long had not b"Â»in culpable In the matter;
that he had given proper -and legal notice of
his withdrawal, and that he would have ap
peared to speak for himself if it wore not for
his serious illness. Judge Wallace said ho
would hear Mr. Long when he was able to
appear.

J. W. Raphael Says There
Lies the Future of
This City.
Glowing Description of the Con
fidence in McKinley in
the East.
Prospects for Immsdiate Considera
tion of the Nicaragua Cinal
Prrj-'Ct Good.
Julius W. Raphael, president of Ra
phael's (incorporated), the larjje Kearny
street clothing firm, arrived in this City
from an extensive Eastern tour yesterday.
During that time he was in New York,
Chicago, Washington, Baltimore and sev
eral other great cities.
Although feeling indisposed from the
effects of typhoid fever, with which he
was stricken in Washington, Mr, Raphael
spoke at length on the condition of affairs
in the East and especially of the prospects
of the Pacific slope as viewed by the East
ern mind.
"Business in the East is very, very
dull," he said. "All lines are looking for
relief at the hands of Congress. Every
thing in money matters, iiowever, is very
easy on account of confidence in the pres
ent administration.
"It is a business-like administration,
and lam free to say the first time in the
history of the United States we have had
one. Tnose not having had the oppor
tunity to talk to Mr. McKinley little appre
ciate what kind of man he is. I have had
that pleasure, and must say that he is
Simon- cure business from the crown of
bia head to the soles of his feet.
"The appointment of Mr. Gage as Secre
tary of the Treasury has met with tbe
hearty approval of the East. All we need
now is for Congress to act in harmony
with the President's policy, and we wiil
have an era of prosperity such as we have
never bad before.
"In anticipation of the new tariff prices
are already advancing, in our lines es
pecially. One thing that cuts an import
ant tieuie with the Pacific Coast is, that
Mr. McKinley is very friendly toward the
Nicaragua-canal project, and so is Mr.
Sherman. That will be one of the first
things he will consider after the enactment
of the new tariff."
After expatiating upon, the way the
reciprocity clauses in the 'new tarift will
benefit California especially, Mr. Raphael
piesented a poll of the Senators for and
against the enactment of a tariff garnered
in Washington, showing the liKeuhood of
the passage of the bili. Ii showed a total
of 53 for, 37 against and 7 on the doubtful
list.
"What California merchants need to do
now," hÂ« continued, "is to reach out for
the Japanese trade. They ar6 going to
locate the line of steamers here, and
there is no reason why we should not get
the bulk of their business if we only try
to do so.
"There are two contemplated changes of I
magnitude In Japanâ from a lisa and rice
diet to a more solid one of meat and other
articles, which this country is in a favored
condition to supply, and from wearing
cotton to woolen garments.
"In woolen cloths it is only a question
of time until California will rind herself
unable to meet the demand. Already the
manufacturers and shippers of t lie Middle
Western States are beginning to make
arrangements with San Francisco mer
chants for a share of this Asiatic trade.
San Francisco is bound to be the center ol
trade with the Orient.
"In Washington I saw Mr. Spear,
Major McLaughlin and Congressman
Maguire. Tney are all Weil, and think our
outlook splendid."

CAUGHT WHILE HERDING
IN COLORADO
Clung to Him While a Commercial
Traveler in the Middle West, Not
withstanding All Efforts to Got
Rid of Itâ Hot Springs of Ar
kansas of No Availâ Cured
by Dr. Williams' Fink
Fills.
From the Chronicle, Chicago, 111.
Mr. William Clement of Freeport, 111., is a
well-known commercial traveler, and repre
sents the large Chicago housu of Reed. Welsh
& Lange. In his tarly liie Mr. Clement mi
grated to the breezy West and became a cow
boy in Colorado. Afior aoiug as much at cow
punching us ho desired, ne turned his atten
tion to mining, the exposure from which and
his life on tue plains undermined a once
Strom? constitution, an'l rheumatism, liver
and k.dney trouble and dropsy made their
unwelcome appearance.
The Hot Springs of Arkansas were visited in
the hope of relief, but he was disappointed,
and so he >ook up his residence in Illinois,
and obtained employment as a drummer for a
large hou.'e in Chicago that has Jong" since
gone out of business. Physicians were con
sulted both at home and while ou the road,
with only pecuniary benefit to tbe doctors,
for Mr. Clement grow worse instead of better,
and constantly had to lay up for weeks at a
time.
It was then that from reading the advertise
ment in the papers the sufferer conceivea the
idfta of trying Dr. Williams' Pink Pill; for Pale
People and did so.
"1 thought," Mr. Clement said to the re
porter, "that 50 cents would not be much ex
penditure so I bought a box of the pills .and
began tak'.ug them according to directions.
"I had not to wail many days before I found
a mirked improvement iv my condition, so I
kept on with the treatment. First my kidneys
began to do their work thoroughly and well
and all bloat left me. Then the rheumatism
and pain in the region of the heart went, my
liver is cured and 1 may say I am as well as i
ever was. It I had only Known of Pink Pills a
few years before I should be a good many
thousand dollars richer."
As usual, when such testimonials are re
ceived at the office of Dr. Williams' Medicine
Company they are sent for verification to the
leading druggists of the vicinity or other per
sons in good stxnding. Tne Â«bove was not an
exception, notwithstanding Mr. Clement's ex
cellent reputation, and ttie returned reports
certified that allot the foreeolng statements
made to the reporter were strictly true.
Dr. Williams' Pink Piils contain, in a con
densed form, all the elements necessary to
give new lite and richness to tbe blood and
restore shattered nerves They are also a s.p?
cific ior troubles peculiar to lemmes, such as
suppressions, irregulurities and all form-, of
weakness. In men they effect a radical cure
in all oases arising from mental worry, over
work or excesses of whatever nature. Pink
Pills are Â«old in boxes (never in loose bulk) at
50 cents a box or six boxes ior $2 50, and may
be had of all druggists or direct by mail from
Dr. Williams' Medicine Company, Schenecta

Central suddenly broke over 3 points on unusually
large transactions The decline was attributed to
rumors of it reduction in the dividend rate Â»t the
April meeting of tne directors. It was said that
payments hereuftir will be on a 4 per cent basis
but nothing of an official character was given out
and the slump was generally escribed to manip

In the grangers Omaha was inclined to weak

â¢ of- the rec nt sharp advance in the specialty.
Northern Pacific preferred, Manhattan and West

CHICAGO, 0 111. ; March 19. â Thcdumbnes
of * speculation was - distinctly apparent in . the
grain markets to-day. What trade there was in
wheat was almost exclusively local in its char
acter with no particular effort being made either
to â  advance or ! depress ;.' prices early. A strong
opening, was ; attributable : to a higher . Liverpool
market, s^d advance taking place there. After
the first ten minutes the action became slow and
siuggisu, prices receding to the extent of th-> early
gain. English consols were steady, which rather
tended to offset the war dispatches in the morning
papers. Rece ipts in the Northwest were heavier,
297 cars arriving against ITi last Friday and 509
a year ago.

COALâ Harrison's, circular says: "During the
week the re have been; two arrivals from -British
Columbia with 3629 tons of Coal, from Oregon and
Washington 9869 tons.' from Cardiff 2789 tons. 90
fur this month there have been only four arrivals
from foreign sources with 11.043 tons of Coal, yet
there -Is no perceptible . change -In ' prices I which
strongly evidences there is a full supply 011 hand
to meet all demands. Of \ course the very limited
Importations ;ot) certain grades of foreign, which
are specially adapted for domestic uses, has caused
a substitution of other brands, as some characters
of (British | house (Coals ! ;<r; entirety I out of stock.'
The consumption of Washington an i Oregon prod
ucts for home purposes has increased materially,
as the prices ot same are 82. 5UÂ®3 $ ton below thÂ«
ueitiÂ»r | grades | of 'British I Columbia ! anil | English.:
Business generally in the fuel line is fair, as sales
are up to the avera:e, but the principal complaint
is he profits [ are I cut I too | fine. The â  Importers of
Austra lan I and English | serin to ; vie , with each
other; to | ascertain I who I can I cut their margins of
profit the finest. In tact, the all important point Is
to effect sates, the I mar* In I of i profit is secondary.
For the amount of capital Invested and risks at.
t ached, there is no commercial line which annually
shows a stual er percentage on the credit side than
the Coal trade. 'i!-":vÂ«.--:--/-:-.ii-i--''.}V-^;.----. .:>â  'â¢â â¢â¢â . - : .â¢-â â¢â¢*â .' .;.

Glass bricks are made extensively in
Germany. They are blown with a hollow
center containing rarefied air and are said
to be as strong and durable as clay bricks.
They freely admit light. So far the glass
brick has only been used in the construc
tion of conservatories, and has been voted
a success. :}'}^}/.-^ r .â¢'/.â :

ENDS PEACEFULLY
S. W. Condon Will Be
Deputy to City Attorney

A Very Small Plum That
Created More Excitement
Than It Is Worth.
It All Arose Out of Antf-Election
Promises Tint It Is Said Were
Never M:d\
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 19. j
One of the most earnest tisrbts fora place
in the new municip.-'l administration has
been that for the office of assistant to the
City Attorney. This contest has been
â  very bitter and nut without some humor
during tbe pasi two weeks. As soon as
the election was over two candidates ap
peared, each of whom claimed the office.
It was not exactly clear by what right
they intended to establish their claims,
but each man told his friends that he
would be tne next deputy to the City At
torney.
These claims went so far as to affect
S. W. CONDON, ex-President County Christian Endeavor Union,
Who Will Be the New Assistant Gty Attorney.
nearly every Republican official in the
city. Ail kinds of threats and counter
threats and promises of unpleasant
things were made unless W. A. Dow, City
Attorney-elect, should be able to perform
the impossibility of appointing two men
to one office.
Mr. Dow, who would naturally seem to
be the one upon whom the responsibility
of making a choice should fall, came to be
regarded, apparently, a? Uie least inter
ested man in the whole aff.iir. When he
did speak, however, there was some sur
prise.
The two men who were the cause of ail
the skirmishing are Richard Ayers, an at
torney, at present doing newspaper work,
and b. W. Condon, also an attorney and 1
ex-president of the Alameda County 1
Christian Endeavor Union. Both these
men claimed to have direct promises from
the friends of Mr. Dow that if tbey should
exert themselves In his favor prior to elec
tion be would, in the event of succe&s, re
ward them with the covated deputvsuip.
After the election the frier.ds of both
men claimed the oilie, and in more than
one. regard they went too far in their \
"persuasions." They threatened Dow that |
unless he accommodated them his official
tenure for the next two years would be [
oue long period of misery for him because
of the amount of "influence" that could
be used arainst him.
For a little while there were meetings
st midnight and on the street corners,
much correspondence and a great deal of
excited buttonholing. Now it is all over.
Mr. Dow calmly announced that Mr.
Condon will be his deputy, and the
friends of Mr. Ayera will probably have
i the satisfaction of seeing him make out
street assessments in the Street Depart-
tuent office.
Thus has ended peacefully a very un
pleasant incident, in which more people
were interested than the paltry nature of
the appointment warranted.
Some Donbt as to Title.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 19.â A huee
transcript of records consisting of 500
pages has been filed with the City
Council. The abstract refers to two blocks j
ot land lying on the east shore of Lake
Merritt, which are clfiimed by Dr. E. H.
Woolsey. The statement was made to the j
Council some months ago that this land ;
really- belonged to the ciiy, and the search
of title was ordered. It co- 1 $400, and, as
the land in question 19 worth not more
than $2000, it is not likely that either side
will make an expensive legal contest.
The Suicide of a Well-Known Jockey.
OAKLAND, Cal.. March 19.â The in
quest on the remains of Sam Carter, the
hockey who shot himself last night, was

to-day decided in favor of the contest
ants in the case of the will of Matthews
Wolfmair. The verdict declared, first,
that the estate was community property,

OAKLAND, Cal., March 19.â The an
nual meeting and election of the Ebell
Society will be held on the second Friday
in April, and already the campaign is wax
ing warm. In accordance with a recent
understanding by which ail the affairs of
the club are to be kept secret, all tiio pre
liminary work will not be known until af
ter the election, when the public will be
informed of the personnel of the new offi

Mrs. Alice Bunnell, who has served for
several terms, is anxious to retire. The
nominating committee consists of Mrs.
Champlin, Mrs. Bishop, Mrs. Nusbaumer,

Gray, Mrs. Borland and Mrs. Godard.
A QUIET CAMPAIGN.
>o Mann-Sleeting and but Very Little
Interest Being Taken in the "
Canvass.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 19.â There
was quite a little spurt of interest in the
municipal campaign while the nomination
of candidates was in abeyance or gome
on, but now that the tickets are all made
up apathy seems to have seized the poli
ticians, and no one except he was posted
would believe from any outward indica
tions t! at it is only about three weeks to
election day. Such a thing as a mass
meeting has not been hold or even sug
gested, and it seems altogether likely that
none will be called.
Some of the candidates are doing a little
i hustling on their own account, but other
| wise matters in the political field are very
! quiet, stagnant in fact, and it is not ap
[ parent that there will be much difference,
unlets the saloon question should betaken
hold of more actively than now seems
probable.
Dodge in Texas.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 19.â The re
ported arrest of Murderer Blanther in
Texas is the cause of George Dodge, who
is well known here, taking a sudden trip
to the Panhandle State for the purpose of
interviewing the prisoner and testifying as
to his identity, podge's wife has been
visiting in this city for several days, but
returned to San Francisco this afternoon.
The departure of her husband for Texas
on the errand mentioned hbs been kept a
profound secret until to-day, but with the
publication of the report of Blanther's ar
rest it was no loneer necessary to keep the
matter a secret and so it came out.
Fenny Purchasing Agency Fraud.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 19.â The col
: lapse of Mrs. Cohen's Penny Purchasing
Agency has a locai interest in Alameda.
Among the thousand or more dupes of
i the scheme were quite a number of credu
! lous residents of this city, mostly thrifty
housewives, who can ill affor-t to lose the
money they invested in the chimerical
plan in the hope of benefiting their fam
ilies.
Lighting the Mole.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 19.â Although
the contract with the railroad company
for lighting the mole with electricity has
not yet been signed the city electrician, G.
H. Wiese, is overwhelmed with applica
tions for employment in the work of
stringing the wires and arranging the
lights. The majority of the applicants
appear to fancy that no special knowledge
is required beyond the ability to climb the
poles which will support the electric wires.
Death of Mrs. Perata.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 19.â Mrs. Ma
ria Perata, one of the pioneer residents of
the W- st End of Alameda, died last night

take place on Sunday afternoon at 1:30
o'clock.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 20, 1897.
THE SECRETS OF
PURCHASED GLORY
Plainly Told in the Papers
Sworn To by the
Candidates.
"Davie Dollars" Were Supplied
at the Rate of Two for
Each Voter.
i
Statements of "Certain Election Ex*
penses" and Their Comparison
With the Official Returns.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call, \
908 Broadway, March 19. )
The affidavits of election expenses filed
by the finance committee of the various
candidates are now pouring into the
Clerk's office, and many of them tell in
teresting chapters of how the battle for
office was fought prior to the public's de
cision at the polls.
This afternoon the statement of John L.
Davie was filed. Mr. Davie spent $268 45.
He could legally have spent $300. His
vouchers are interesting, and show just
how much of the mlsome notices pub
lished in all manner of publications were
spontaneous on the part of the editor and
just how many were articles of commerce.
One of the most interesting items in Mr.
Davie's account is that for 15,000 "Davie
dollars." These dollars were spread all
over Oakland two or three days before
election. They were cardboard coins,
with a head of the Mayer ou one side and
a reference to his dollar-tax limit on the
other. They were generously distributed,
and the number prlu;ed showed that there
were one and two-thirds lor every name
on tne Great Register.
City Attorney Peirsol, who received a
very light vote, paid $266 for the privilege
of trying to succeed Himself. Mr. Peirsol
seemed to do a little business with nearly
every house in Ban Francisco and Oak
land, but the most complete biography ap
peared in the Elevator.
The citizens who inspected these state
ments in the Clerk's office learned a great
lesion in politics. Many of them were
surprised to find that the elaborately
written defense of a candidate's public
record was worth just so many sordid
cents per line. In the case of defeated
candidates it is very amusing to read on
the vouchers, "Mr. Smith will certainly
be the next Mayor of Oakland," and then
to glance at the complete returns and find
that Mr. Smith received about one vote
in every fifty that were cast.
Martin E^an, a member of the Repub
lican Alliance, who appeared on the bal
lot as a Democratic candidate for library
trustee, polled over 3000 votes without the
expenditure of a cent. Mr. Egan called
on the County Cierk this afternoon and
was informed that where a man bad paid
nothing out it is not legally necessary for
iiim to file a "statement of expenses."
There are several other candidates yet
to hear from, hut none whose methoi of
expending the limit allowed by the purity
oi election law is likely to create any
trouble.
THEIR FIGHT RENEWED.
College Y. M. C A. Members
Take Time by the
Forelock.
They Will Endeavor to Keep Liquor
" Ads " Fr m the Puges of '99*1
"Blue and Gold."
BERKELEY, Cal., March 19. â The
Young Men's Christian Association at the
State University has taken time by the
forelock in an effort to prevent liquor
"ads" from being published in '99's Blue
and Gold. Having lost the battle in their
effort to keep "ads" of this character out
of '98's yearbook, they are none the less
daunted, but have bobbed up serenely,
and say they will fight their causa this
time to a finish. They have already com
menced action, though the officers of the
book in question have not been elected.
There is some talk of putting a Y. M. C. A.
candidate in the field for the manager
ship, who will be pledged if elected to
keep the liquor ads out entirely.
Id their contention with the class of '98
the Christian Association did not cast
their first bomb until the book was well
undei way and the plans of the manager
and editor had fully matured. Then reso
lutions were introduced before the class
and the members were called upon to de
cide the question. The young women
rallied to the support of the Y. M. C. A.
and the meeting was attended by the
largest delegation of co-eds that ever at
tended a class meeting at Berkeley. But
the proposition of excluding the adver
tisements was lost by a close vote.
BERKELEY FIELD DAY.
Mettle of Freshmen to Be Tried This
Afternoon on the University
Cinder Track.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 19.â The ath
letes at the State University will hold a
field day to-morrow afternoon on the
Berkeley cinder track. About thirty men
will enter the different events. This field
day will be in effect somewhat of a substi
tnie for the annual freshman-sophomore
contest, as the first opportunity will thus
be afforded to trr the mettle of the new
men.
It is anticipated that several surprises
will be sprung by members of the fresh
man class, especially by Griffin In the
mile walk and Broughton in the sprints.
Griffin has b*en covering the mile in 7:34
at practice, thus approximating the uni
versity record by eight seconds. Brough
ton has been doing 10 2-5 seconds work in
the 100, and close on his heels hnye been
McNab and Drumm. In the mile Hazel
tine has gained some distinction.
Among the other freshman entries upon
whom much attention will be centered
are: Goodale and Hoffman in the high
jump, CheeK in the shot, Cheek and Dow
son in the hurdles, Simonds in the broad
and Westerfeld and A ikon in the mile.
There will be, in addition to the regular
order of track and field contests, several
open events, among which will be a
weight-casting exhibition by Tom Carroll,
the great hammer-thrower.
The records made to-morrow will form
a basis upon which to work in view of
the coming intercollegiate match.
Endeavor Rally.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 19.â A grand
rally of the Christian Endeavorers belong
ing to the Berkeley Union was held this
evening at the First Presbyterian Church.
The churches represented were the First
Presbyterian, First Congregational, North
Berkeley Congregational, Trinity Metho
dist, Dwight-way Baptist and the Quaker
church. About 250 delegates were pres
ent. The rally was held with the view to
creating interest in the National conven
tion of the Christian Endeavor Socieiv to
be held in San Francisco next July. Rev.
Dr. E. R. DUle of San Francisco was the
speaker of the evening.
Fink and White Wedding.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 19.â There
was a very pretty pink and white wed
ding last evening at the Congregational
church, when Henry W. yon Kapff and
Miss Grace A. Marsden were united in
marriage by Rev. Dr. Scudder. After the
ceremony a reception and bail were given
at the residence of the bride's grandfather,
George Brown, 2103 San Jose avenue.
A LIVELY BLAZE.
During Its Progress Thieves Enter a
House and Steal a Valuable
Diamond Ring. ,-.' â 
ALAMEDA. Cal., March 19.â At 1:40
o'clock this morning an alarm was turned
in for a tire in the dwelling of VV. Meyer
hoffer at 1552 VeMi street. The flames
had made good headway before the de
partment reached tbe scene and the ad
joining houses on both sides were also
burning to a slignt extent. These were
first attended to by the engines and then
the streams were turned on the Meyer
hoffer house. The upper part of the nouse
was badly damaged before the fire was
controlled. It is the property of P. P.
Baker of San Francisco and was insured
for $4000, with $500 additional on the con
tents. The dwelling of Pelix Marcuse,
adjoining on the corner of Verdi street
and Railroad avenue, also caugbt fire and
was damaged several hundred dollars.
While the fire was burning many of the
articles in tne house were removed,
strangers assisting, and after tho flumes
had been extinguished Mr. Marcuse found
that some one had stolen a valuable dia
mond ring. There is no clew to the thief.
The residence of C. A. Smith, at 1548 Verdi
street, was also damaged several hundred
dollars.
WANT A BOY'S LIBERTY.
It Is Said That D\ Shannon Is
Holding the Lad Against
His Will.
Circumstances Seem to Sbcw Tbat
Tfcere Is a Mis ppreliension of
Facts in tin C \%t.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 19. j
Prominent colored people, including
ministers and doctors, are convinced that
a colored boy about the age of 14 years is
being held against his will by Dr. J. M.
Shannon of East O kland, and to-day
they addressed the iollowing petition to
the Children's Society:
Mrt. Preeeott, Secretary of the Society for Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children: We, the under
signed residents of Alameda County, having
learned that a colored boy about th<- age of
14 is being held in bondage by Dr. J. M. Shan
non of East Oakland, and that said boy was
forced to leave on account of bad treatment,
and has since buen compelled to return against
his own will to said Dr. Shannon, we therefore
appeal to you, as superintendent of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Chil
dren, asking you to have the matter thor
oughly investigated and see that justice is
done.
Rev. J. L. Allen, pnstor Beth Eden Baptist
Church; Rev. J. E. Edwards, pastor First A.
M. E. Church ; Dr. C- D. Cole. William Craw
ford, A. F. Holland, John F. Wiles, W. F. De
lalney, James Washington, A. A. Collins.
Upon investigation it wcnld seem that
tbe petitioners do not thoroughly under
stand the circumstances. Dr. Shannon
brought the lad from Mississippi about
three years ago and has b -en appointed
his leeal guardian. He sent tbe boy to
the Franklin night school and in the day
time he made the lad generally useful
around the house. The doctor regarded
him as unusually bright and intelligent.
About three weeks ago the boy disap
peared. An investigation showed that he
had been taken away from tbe doctor's
house by a man who had made him all
kinds of promises. Eventually he was
left at '.he house of W. M. Johnson in the
Watts Tract by a ruan who told Johnson
he would call lor him next day.
The police declared it to* be a case of
kidnaping, and Johnson willingly sur
rendered the boy.
The lad staled at the time that the man
in taking him away told him be would
get him a better place with plenty of
money. He was anxious to co back to
Dr. Shannon, and when found by the
police he requested that he at once be
taken to the doctor.
Chief of Police Lloyd took the lad to the
doctor's home, where be has been appa
rently contented ever since. He does not
say that he is being held in bondage
aeainst his will, and the officials believe
that the petitioners, though conscientious,
have received untrustworthy information.
Slay Be Clsus Anthony.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 19.â A drowned
horse with a buggy still attached to It
was found in Alameda Creek yesterday.
A trunk was found near the buggy with a
man's outfit, a memorandum-book, sev
eral photographs and a watch. In the
book was the name of Claus Anthony. It
is said that a stranger was seen near Niies
the previous night with a woman in a
buggy snd asked the way to Livermore.
Judge Ogden, who came up from Niies
to-day, said that there was no clew to the
identity of the people who had been in
the buggy, and that although the suppo
sition was the occupants had been drowned
there was nothing to substantiate that
theory.

POSTOFFICE PROSPECTS.
Congressman Loud, Jlnswering the Reso
lutions Passed Jtepe, Says It My Be
Started Early in tlje Summer.
The exact condition of affairs as regards the San Francisco
Postoffice is now known. The resolution adopted by the various com
mercial and industrial bodies of this City and forwarded to Representa
tive E. F. Loud at Washington, D. C, has met with a response wel
come to all. Mr. Loud is the Chairman of the Committee on Postoffice
and Post Roads ef the House, and as such is in a position to know ex
actly what we need to do to get the building in the near future.
As will be gleaned from a perusal of his response to the resolution,
the yellow-dog journalism which snaps and snarls at every reform
movement is the whole cause of delay thus far, The Examiner edi
torial caustically commenting on the plans was duly noticed, although
no reference was made to the paper by name. If this journalistic freak
will only cease its sullen growling for a brief period, the building may
be started by early summer, as Mr. Loud asserts." In full his reply is
as follows:

SIRS:â
I am in receipt of resolution, adopted by your several commercial
and industrial organizations, urging early commencement upon the work
of building of the San Francisco Postoffice, and, in reply, will say that
every effort will be made on the part of the delegation to secure the
same as early as is possible.
The fact, however, must not be lost sight of, that four years of the
past administration has been allowed to pass without any effort on the
part of the people to urge commencement of this work, and upon the
very first day of the incoming administration the concentrated effort
was made to start the project. Now we are satisfied that it will be the
policy of this administration not longer to delay work of this character
than is necssary.
There is another matter that I desire to call to the attention of your
respective bodies, and that is, that from the very inception of this pro
ject the San Francisco press have almost universally criticized and con
demned the movement.
A San Francisco paper that I glanced over to-day intimates rather
caustically that the plans should be revised. Four years ago I was
somewhat severely criticized personally for the action I took in having
the limit of cost fixed upon said building, which would permit the admin
istration to proceed with the work. Many times since, as well as
before, the character of the foundation of the lot has been, however
justly 1 will not say, very severely criticized by the public press and
many of our citizens.
Of course you can understand that clippings of the San Francisco
papers are kept on file here, and almost every effort that has been
made by the delegation has been counteracted by our own people. I
trust that we have now entered upon a new era, and that our people
will concentrate their united efforts in another direction and endeavor to
work in harmony toward the completion of the San Francisco Postoffice.
Sufficient money, permit me to say, has been appropriated by Congress
to inaugurate the work. Two years ago the building was placed under
what we call the ''continuous contract system" â that is, authorizing
the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into a contract for the comple
tion of the building. Now, if we can amicably settle with some of our
people the matter of plans for the building, I think we shall have no
difficulty in getting it started during the early summer. We can only
regret that the same unanimity of the people did not exist regarding
this project during the past that seems to exist now.
Am also in receipt of a memorial to Congress urging an appropria
tion of $250,000, together with an unexpended balance of $240,000. I
have substantially answered these suggestions above. There is not,
however, $240,000 of unexpended balance, but there is a sufficient
appropriation, with the power the Secretary of the Treasury has, to
contract for the completion of the building, to inaugurate and carry
forward the work. Your petition to Congress is wholly unnecessary,
as the authority to construct the building is vested in the Secretary of
the Treasury, and no further amount of money is needed at present.
Truly yours, E. F. LOUD.

A Broken Wheel on an Overland Train
Causes Quite a Commotion.
The passengers on the Western-bound
overland train, which arrived in this City
yesterday at 1:30 o'clock, received quite a
good shaking up after the train had left
the summit of the Sierra Novadas on its
journey to Sacramento.
When near Gold Hill, which is a small
station in the mountains on the railroad,
the passengers who were sleeping were
awakened by a thumping and a bumping
on the track, wnich racket kept up for
quite a distance before the train came to
a halt. On inquiry it was ascertained ; hat
a wheel under one of the open cars, which
was next to the baggage-car, had broken,
and was tearing along (he ties. Thosa
who were on toard the car which lost its
wheel became very much excited, as the
train was moving along at a pretty good
rate of speed.
Some one pulled the bell rope, but it
failed to work, and as a result ttie broken
wheel and very much jarred car tore along
over the ties for at least a mile before the
engineer discovered that something wits
wrong.
It appears that the train was stopped in
good season. Had the broken wheel
caught on any of the bridges which span
cuiv-Tts on the road an accident fearful to
contemplate might have happened. A
delay of over three hours resulted until
the necessary changes and repairs were
HEW 10-DAT.

THE LIE GIVEN
IN A COURTROOM
Dr. Marion Thrasher De
noupced a Remark by
Attorney Deuprey.
Judge Seawell Warned the Dis
putants to Beware of Con
tempt Proceedings.
Little Effie V. R. Ho strom's CustoJy
Will Soon Be Judicially D â¢
termined.
The case of little Effie V. R. Holstrom
was called up in Judge Seawell's court
yesterday for tbe purpose of deciding who
shall have the custody of herâ Mrs. Lou
Holstrom, her foster mother, or Mra.
Sarah d'Artenay, who was Sallie C. MÂ«
guire, an unmarried woman, at the time
of tbe child's birth.
The opposing petitions were read, in
which each woman accused the other of
being an improper person to hare charge
of a child ot tender years.
It usually happens that this case leads
to some kind of an outbreak whenever it
comes up in court, and yesterday was no
exception. During the examination of
Mrs. Sarah Thrasher, wife of Dr. Marion
Thrasher, there was some contention be
tween the witness and Attorney Eugene
>'. Deuprey in record to the numoer of
times that Mrs. Thrasher visited Mr.
Deuprey's uflice.
"1 was at bis office only once, and he
knows it," declared -the lady.
"I say that she visued mr office three
times," responded Mr. Deuprey.
"That's a lie," shouted Dr. Thrasher
from the rear of the room.
Judge Seawell directed the bailiff to
preserve order, and that official prevented
further trouble by stepping between the
belligerent gentlemen. They were warned
to beware of punishment for contempt of
court. They may hear more of this mat
ter at the conclusion of the trial.
The first documentary evidence In the
case was a writing, by which Mrs. Hoi
strom obtained possession of the child iv
December, 1892. It reads as follows:
Sax Francisco, Dec. 21, 1892.
To whom it may concern: 1 this day iv the
prttseneeof the witnesses herein mentioned
convey and b-queatU my blue-eyed, dark
haired girl baby, born December 15, 1892, at
1341 Vaiencni street, San Francisfo, Cal., to
Mrs. Lou Hoiatrom ot Empire City, Or., to
raise, to educate as her owl child, and to
ado; t thus itgally, and to inherit the said Mr.
and Mrs. Hoistrom's property as a legal heir.
Sallie c. Maguire
\Yitnesses: M. Thrasher, M.D., Mrs. M. Han
cock, Mrs. M. L. Kankin.
I accept the conditions above.
Mrs. Lor Holstrom.
Mrs. Sarah d'Artenay, formerly Miss
Mauuire, mother of tne cnud, was the
first witness She testified that she is
married to Pnilip d'Artenay, who is a res
ident of Dixon, C'oiusa County, and is a
blacksmith by trade, owning his own
shop. She said that her husband is will
ing to have tbe chiid come into his house
hold; that sne has been married for near
ly four years and has nad do children.
She said that she heard that Mrs. Hol
strom wished to give the child up, and
she wanted it back. She said she gave
the child to Mrs. Hoistrom treely, but
now wishes to have it returned. Bhe ad
mitted that she signed the paper soon
after the birth of the child giving the cus
tody to Mrs. Hoistrom, but sail she eot
no money. She asked Mrs. Hoistrom to
pay Dr. Thrasher for his servicss at the
confinement, and she understood tnat $5
or $10 had been paid on that account by
Mrs. Holstrom.
Denial was made by Mtr. d'Artenay to
all suggestions that Dr. Thrasher and his
wife were interested in the taking of the
child. She said Officer Frank Kane knew
that she waÂ« goii.tr to take the chiid to
Dixon, but there was no conspiracy.
When Mr. Deuprey asked if she did not
know that such an act was kidnaping an
objection was interposed by Attorney
Mtttt I. Suhivan, and the question was
ruled out by the court.
Mrs. d'Artenay said that Mrs. Holstrom
told her she bad palmed off the child on
her husband as her own. When asked to
give up the child Mrs. Holstrnm said she
wouldn't give it up for a $1,000,000. but
Mrs. Hoistrom's mother thought $1000
would be enough.
Dr. Marion Thrasher told the story of
the transfer of the infant from Mrs.
d'Artenay to Mrs. Holstrom substantially
as set forth in the wr'tten contract. He
SBid he wrote out an adoption paper. He
thou^nt it was legal at the time. No cora
peusation was paid to Mrs. d'Artenay lor
the child. Some money was paia to bim,
but that was for his fee as a physician.
About two weeks afterward Mrs. Hol
etrom called on him and toid him that sne
had been playing off sick, pretending to
be in confinement in order to deceive her
husband ; that her husband expected her to
bring a baby back to Oregon and this was
the baby sh- would take and impose it on
him as their child.
"Last August." he said, "I met Mr?.
Holstrom and she said she was going to
get a divorce and marry a man wno didn't
like children, so sbe inten ted to put little
Eflie or S. V. as sbe called her into an
orphan aÂ«ylnm. Then I told her if she
thougiit of putting the baby in an orphan
asylum I would like to have the child
back so that I could return it to Us true
mother, who was looking for a chilu to
adopt ana would prefer to have her own
baby if possible."
Mrs. Sarah Thrasher confirmed the story
that Mrs. Holstrom had said that she
wished to make people think, it was her
own, that Mrs. Hoistrom got up out of bed
when sbe bad been pretending to be sick.
About a year and a half ago M rs. Holstrom
told the witness that she adopted the chiid
because h -r nusband had accused her of
associations that would preven; Her from
having children, and she wanted this cnild
to show him so that it would convince him
that he was wrong. On one occasion Mrs.
Thrasher called and told Mrs. Holstrom
and Mrs. Lighthali, mother of Mr;. Hol
strom, that if ihey wanted to give the child
up the witness ilesired 10 get the little one
in order io deliver it to us mother. The
response made by them was that they had
paid $15 a mouth for milk for tho baby and
that they ought to have $1000.
Mr. Deuprey wanted to Know why Mrs.
Thrasher concealed the identity of Mrs.
d'Artenay when she took the child out
driv.ng with her in August, 1896, and Mrs.
Thrasher said she thought it was honor
able. Mrs. Holstrom and Mrs. d'Artenay
did not meet and she did not introduce
them.
On one occasion tbe witness and her
husband went to Mrs. Hoistrom's douse
and asked if she div intend to put little
Kffie in an orphan asylum, and sne ac
knowledged that she bad lold Dr. Thrash
er that sucii had been her lnientioii.
Mrs. Martin of Oakland, who has the
temporary custody oi the child, asked to
be relieved of that duty, saying tnat she
had not been able to get a night's sleep
for more tlian two weeks, because the baby
persists in fretting and crying lor one ot
tbe mothers.
Mr. Deuprey tried to have her say that
the little one is yearning for the care of
her foster mother, Mrs. Holstrom, but the
court thought it would be better to defer
that question, and finally Mrs. Martin
consented to keep the child lor another
week, when the dispute will probably be
fettled.
l>r. McLean Discharged.
Dr. James McLean, who was accused by a
woman named Olga Zollner of malpractice,
was yeÂ«tÂ«rday discharged by Judge Low. The
prosecuting witness failed to put in an ap
pearance, and Dr. McLean exhibited a letter
from her.
HOME MISSIONS.
A Prosperous Year Knported by the
Society in Charge.
The annual meeting of the San Fran
cisco Presbyterian Home Missionary So
rieiy took place yesterday at Howard
Presbyterian Church, on Baker and Odk

tional service. "Pen and Ink Sketches,"
a paper prepared by Mrs. H. H. Bevier,

to be, being made up largely of letters
from the different Presbyterian missions.
Some were from snow-clad Alaska and
some from the sunny south, all telling of
the good works being done by the mis
sionaries there. With but one or two ex
ceptions tin- wort was progressing
rapidly. Over $1500 has been given to the
home missionaries during the year by the
iadies of the society. After a paper on
"Motive Power," by Mrs. J. P. Prutzman,

LONG HUNT FOR
BLANTHER OVER
Captain Lees Confident the
Murderer Is in a Texas
Jail.
George Dodge Sent South to
Identity Mrs. Langfeldt's
Slayer.
Detective Gib on Accompanies Him
With Requisit on Pap3rs for
the Fugitive.
If police theories go for anything, Josef
E. Blanther, the fugitive murderer of Mrs.
Philipma Langfeldt at her home at 1225
Geary street on May 15 last, is as good
as behind the bars of the City Prison.
Captain Lees is confident that the famous
criminal is now in custody, or atjeast in
surveillance, in Texas, and that he will be
JOSEF E. BLANTHER, Who h Thought by the Police to Have
Been Cap.v ed in Texas.
brought back to this City for trial within
the coming week.
At any rate, the Chief of Police has se
cured requisition papers from Governor
Budd on Governor Culberson of Texas for
the extradition of a prisoner, who, he has
every reason to believe, is no other man
than Blanther. Detective Gibson is now j
on his way to Austin.
Accompanying him is George Dodge,
who goes along to identify the prisoner.
Dodge was an intimate acquaintance of
the fugitive during his stay in this CiÂ»y, â 
and if the Texas suspect is the much- j
wanted man Dodge will be able to say so. j
Captain Lees thus far is oniy verifying j
a suspicion. It is almost certain that the j
chase ior Mrs. Langteldt's murdprer is at ;
an end, but until the arrival of Gibson '
and Dodge in Texas the exact truth will
DOC be known. As many aa lilty men j
have be^n arrested in d.fferent parts of \
the country since Blamber's flight irom '
this City on May 1H last, but in each in- !
stance it was a cÂ»se of mistaken identity.!
With this experience to protit by Cap
tain Lees is making no definite announce- |
menti nntil the identity of the Texas mis- i
peer is established beyond all doubt. He i
will not even make known the manner in
which he learned that his game was in |
Governor Culberson : s domain, nor will he â 
intimate in what part of the big State the j
man whom Detectives Gibson and Dodge i
are gone to scrutinize is located.
If the police expectations are realized it
ia probable ttint B. anther has not been so !
far away from han Francisco as rumor j
would have it. When he made his memo- !
rable fligh' from thi-j City on the day fol
lowing the murder of his aged victim
Blanther uad a deket for El Paso, pur
chased at Port Costa.
The police discovered this after Blan
ther was well nn his way to his destina
tion, and althoueh every effort was made
to intercept him the murderer dropped to
all intents and purposes out of existence.
Then was begun a hunt that will go down
in the annals of criminal history, for the j
efforts made to capture the young Aus
trian officer are probably unparalleled in !
this country. Certainly no other criminal j
ever was the subject of "as znucu distribu
tion of literature. Thousands and thou- j
â¢ands of circulars were spread broadcast, j
Copies of these circulars were printed in
many languages and literally mailed to
every postmaster in the civilized world, i
In addition 2000 copies of the murderer's \
pbotoprapn were circulated among detec- !
lives and sheriffs in tiie United States.
In the nine months that the poiice ma- !
chinÂ°ry has been working nicht and day i
to effect itis arrest not a word bus been
heard of the missing men. Once at El
Paso the doors of Mexico Were open to
nun, and believing that it was in that
country teat he was hiding Captain Lees
plastered the republic of Diaz with uic

lures of the murderer. If tbe Texas sus
pect is really the man so much desired it
is probable that Blanther never left the
United States, or even Texas for that
matter, at all. He could have dropped off
at somi way station and been > wallowed
up in thÂ« frontier of that bis State.
Captain Lees is reticent aboat.aiscussinp
tbe matter at all. The requisition papers
were issued with the greatest secrecy.
The destination of Gibson and Dodge,
after their interview with the Governor of
Texas at Austin, is also a secret. Texas is
a pretty big. State, and Captain Lees abso
lutely refuses to divulge the portion of it
in which he believes the famous murderer
is located.
The detective's silence leads to the sus
picion that the situation in Texas is such
that the suspected Bianther might be
scared off if he learned that California de
tectives were after him. It may be that
he is not even in jail.
There is a reward ol $1000 for the fugi
tive's arrest, and asÃlaniher had one or
two intimate friends in tbis City with
whom he was supposed to be in corre
spondence, it may be that his whereabouts
has been betrayed in this manner. Gibson
and Dodge are due to arrive in Austip
on Sunday and Captain Lees hopes to
know tue exact trutu on Monday.
blnnther's crimn was as atrocious as his
escane from the meshes of the police was
remarkable.
Mrs. Langfeldt was aged, but supposed
to be wealthy, and it was this lust mat ai
tracted Blanther, who was a former officer
in the Austrian army, to her. Alter a
short acquaintance ~ith her he was asked
to call. That was on the evening of May
15 last. In the morning the woman was
lound in her apartments with her throat
cut from ear 10 ear. The room was in dis
order, and several of the dead woman'?
diamonds were missing. The crime was
subsequently traced to Blanther, but be
fore he could be arrested he took passage
to Oakland, and thence to Texas on the
following day.
IS NIELSON INSANE?
He Was Arrested Yesterday on
a Warrant for Such a
Charge.
Declares an Attempt I; Being Hade
to Secure Valuable Docu
m>otf.
William M. Neilson, an editorial writer of
the News Letter, wno lias figured conspicu
ously iv numerous stirring episodes in the
history of Sin Francisco, was arrested yester
day afternoon on a warrant alleging his in
sanity, which was sworn to by the lady wbo
until a few months ago was his wife.
Mrs. Neitson, who U now residing with her
mother at Twenty-third and CapD streets,
claims to have had a stormy time with Mr.
Xeilsoni which, contrary to her houes, did not
cease whÂ«Â« she obtained a divorce from htm
on the ground of cruelty.
Since tuat time, she claims, Neilson has
been In the habit of visiting her mother's
residence intent upon making himself di*
agreeable, and to mis end, when refused ad
mittance to the bouse, that he has kicked
vigorously at the door ami otherwise mnaÂ« his
presence apparent and o'.moxious. Neilsun,
who gives little evidence of mental aberration,
denies in toto his wife's charges. He char
acterizes the whole proceedings as an at
tempt to obtain iroin turn valuable papers.
These he brought with him to the Receiving
Hospital, and he was much exercised wnen
the satchel containing them was temporarily
misplaced.
Nellsen obtained a great deal of prominence
in connection with the famous Sharon case,
during the pendency of which he acted as
bodyguard to Sarah Althea. He afteward
fleured prominently In the exciting Incidents
attending' the administration of Mayor Kai
locb, and it was Neilseu who was credited
with having dug up the Eastern record of the
Mayor. A libel suit which he brought against
Judge Murphy later called him to public at
ti-iuioit. Recently he has had various minor
legal difficulties.
Last eve. ting he was released from the Re
ceiving Hospital on an order made by Judge
Hebbard. To-day Inquiry will be made into
his sanity.
Declared to Be Unfair.

TTIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 20, 1897.
ALL TRUE FRIENDS OF
CUBA WILL RALLY TO-NIGHT
Final Preparations for the Great Demonstration at
Metropolitan Temple.
List of Speakers, the iY\ass=Meeting Committee and the Vice-
Presidents Who Will Occupy the Platform.
Go and Show Your Colors.
To-night at Metropolitan Temple San
Francisco will raise her voice to the
powers that guide the destinies of the
Nation in an ardent, soul-inspiring appeal
for Cuba Libre.
"Liberty and justice" will be the cry,
and, though ihe distance is great, the
ringing voice of the peode will reach to
the innermost recesses of the mansion
where dwells the chief executive of the
United States, even to the ear of President
McKinley.
That cry has reached the length and
breadth of the continent ere this, and the
Guardian City of the Golden Gate but sup
plies her portion of the migbty chorus.
No stronger feeling finds a place in the
American heart than the love of liberty,
and that it will find full expression at the
mass-meeting to-night there is no reason
to doubt.
San Francisco has never lacked sym
pathy for the little band of patriots that
has struggled so long and manfully against
the hosts of the Spanish, but it has never
before been given expression in a manner
to convince the Nation and those in whose
hand the fate of a people lies that San
Francisco is united on two subjectsâlib
erty and justice.
Liberty for Cubn, justice for the sons
and daughters of America thatdwell with
in her ware-lapped borders.
In the character of the cause and in tbe
prominence of thoÂ«e who have promoted
and brought the movement to a splendid
climax the mass-meeting will be one of
the most notable ever held in San Fran
cisco.
These are the men who form the com
mittee that arranged the great demonstra
tion and to whom the success is due:

and who is preparing to open another
house at Kiondyke in the new and prom

arrived here yesterday, and is at the Com
mercial.
Mr. O'Brien came 728 miles by dog
team along liie Yukon, ana reached the
coast after making an average of 31%
miles a day. He left Forty Mile on Jan
uary 21. B. F. Knight, who, with an In
dian, came with Mr. O'Brien, left Circle
City on January 2 and joined Mr. O'Brien
at Forty Mile.
They had two dog teams of five dogs
each, the dogs being driven tandem, and
men and animals stood the trip well,
though the thermometer was often 60 de
grees below zero. To protect the feet of
the dogs they were shod in boots of ca.i
vas, tied about with v string. The crisp
snow and thin ice which nt times broke
under their weight could not then cut the
feet.
Mr. O'Brien brought out 400 letters, and
for these be was paid $1 each. He reports
ovcrviiocly well in the two big camps of
the Yukon.
â¢â¢There are about 1200 people wintering
inJCiicle City and of these 350 are working
on Mastodon, Eagle and Harrison Creeks
and Daadwood Gulch," said Mr. O'Brien.
"They seem to be doing very well. There
are about 200 houses in Circle City, all
being of lops. They are all one story high,
except seven, which are two stories and
are used rnauily as large stores.

"Thousands of people are going to
Alaska this year. Seattle was tbronged
with men going there as I came down.
I' m afraid there will be too many there â so
many that the steamers cannot take in
enough food to supply them. The steam
ers can supply about 4000 people and that
is all.
"Where the Rocky Mouutains come
down to the mining district it is quite
rich, an it is el-ewhere. There is an abun
dance of ibex, bighorn sheep and goats.
Musk oxen have also been brought down
to us at different times from the vicinity
of the Great Slave Lake. However, the
Canadian Government has now prohibited
the killing of them.
"On Mastodon Creek we found buffalo
horns, the same as in Montana, and down
on the Mackenzie River there nre buffalo.
Occasionally one that lias been killed
reading us by heine packed in on native
sleds. The American raindeer are also seen
during parts of tbe year in great numbers.
Elk are also found liberally dispersed
through that reeion."
Mr. O'Brien has been in the Yukon
country ten years. For five yean he was
actively engaged in mining. He took the
first hydraulic apparatus to Forty Mile
that ever went there. He is now on his
way to his old home in Ottawa, Canada.
He will return here about June 1 and will
take lome goods north with him.
He says it is not so cold in that part of
tbe northern region as most persons would
suppose, at least they do not seem to no
tice it particularly.
"Take it when tbe thermometer goes
down to 40," he said, "and 10 or 20 degrees
more don't seem to make any difference.
I don't mind the weather much more than
I did in Ottawa. But, of course, a man
wears furs and when winter comes on he
wears one suit straight through. There is
no such a thing as taking it off for some
thing else. 1 '
MET DEATH UNDER WHEELS
James Trebucq Falls From His Truck
and la Inatautly
Killed.
James Trebucq. 53 years of *ge, a team
sttr by occupation, met his death in a
very peculiar manner at College Hill, near
the Fivs-mile House, on the Mission road,
last evening.
When last seen Trebucq was on his
track, taking a load of wood to his home.
Half ar. boar later his body was found
lying in the road.
The deceased's head was directly in the
track left by the truck, and the skull was
crushed in a gnastly manner. About 100
feet away stood the truck that caused
Trebucq's death* the horses having
stopped when they found that they were
witdout a driver. One of the rear wheels
was SDattered with blood. It is believed
that Trebucq became drowsy on the seat,
lost his bi lance, fed under the wheels and
was kiiled in an instant.

SUPERVISORS
NEAR THE GOAL
One More Ssssion Will
Complete the Water
Icquiry.
Engineer Schussler and the
Mayor Exchange Playful
Amenities.
But Little Additional Information
Elicitedâ Complaints to Be Heard
N xt Friday.
The water rates investigation was re
sumed last night by the Board of Super
visors in committee of the whole.
The first business taken up by the com
mittee was the consideration of the com
pany's detailed statement ot its pumping
plant, which was read by the clerk.
The chairman called attention to tbe
fact that the valuation of the pumping
plant was not touched upon in this re
port.
Engineer Schussler said that the copy of
tne questions handed in to the company
did not reler to valuation. The company,
however, was perfectly ready to remedy
the omission.
Tbe committee then proceeded to dis
cuss the following statement of tbe com
pany's stocks and bonds:
Six per cent bonds, first mortgage, number
iÃMie<l nnd outstanding 4975 of $1000 each,
$4 975,000; interest at 6 per cent, payable
Kemi-anriually, amounting per aunum to
$298,500.
Second mortgage or 4 per cent bonds, num
ber issued and outstanding 5000 of $1000
each, $5,000,000; interest at 4 per cent, pay
able quarterly, $200,000.
Detailed statement of the amount of bonds
and stock sold during the year 1896, and the
amount realized and Its imposition. Number
ot bonds sold in 1896: Five thousand shares
of stock were sold in 1896 for the sum of
$486,600 12, and said sum was used for the
payment of indebtedness other than bonded
indebtedness.
Detailed statement of bonds Issued and out
standing and the rate of Interest paid thereon :
Six per cent bond.*, fint mortgageâ NumDer
isMied and outstanding, 4975, of $1000 each,
$4,1*75 000; interest at 6 per cent, payable
hemi-Hnnually, amounting per annum to
$298,500*
Second mortgages, or 4 per cent bondsâNum
ber issued and outstanding, 5000, of $1000
each, $5,000,000; interest at 4 per cent, pay
able quarterly. $200,000.
No bonds were sold in 1896. Five thou
sand shares of stock were sold in 1896 for
the sum of $486,690 12 and said bum was
used for the payment of indebtedness
other than bonded indebtedness.
Engineer Schussler, replying to Mayor
Phelan, asain stated that the company s
property was worth more than the bonds
and stocks wonld realize. He felt con
vinced that the slock would sell for more
than 98 if the people only entertained as
~ood an opinion of and knew as much
about the works as he did. The fact tnat
the stock did not sell at par was due to
want of confidence, attributable In a great
measure to the rat-s beine subjected to
the regulation of every fresh Board oJ
Supervisors. . .
He contended that the low rate of in
terest paid by savings banks was caused
by the security of thu investment.
The Mayor' asked : "Assnming that
your property is worth more than the
capital stock plus th- bonded indebted
ness, wot*ld you not think that an invest
ment in your stock when the Supreme
Court has guaranteed you a reasonable
rate would be safer than an investment
in a savings bank at 4 per cent ?"
Engineer Schusslerâ We would be quiti
satisfied if that reasonable rate were 6 per
cent.
The Mayor rejoiced that the rate of in
terest was not a fixed quantity, and, as
Mr. Ames had said, money was worth
what, it would bring in the mnrket. Ten
years ago 8 per cent was freely paid, but
now 5 per cent was the average rate.
In the course of further discussion be
tween the Mayor and Air. Schussler the
former instituted a comparison between
the gas compauy and the water company,
his intention being to show that water
works should be a sufer undertaking than
gas works. To illustrate this principle he
pursued the Socratic method of conduct
ing an argument.
"Who made the water?" asked he.
"God Alnrighty," was the prompt and
orthodox reply.
"Who makes the cas?"
'â¢Mr. Crocker, I believe," responded the
witness, with a smile.
He insisted, in spite of the Mayor's illus
trations, that a water investment was in
many respects more uncertain than a Â«as
investment. In fact, he wouldn't be pre
pared to advise a man with small capital j
to invest it all in stock of that description.
It would be safer to deposit it in a savings
bank.
After this desultory discussion had con
tinued for some time, both gentlemen in
dulging in what are known as badinage
and persiflage, the Mayor reverted to the
much-discussed question of the New York
water works.
Mr. Kchussler pointed out that the
Mayor omitted from his calculations the
higher pressure supplied by the Spring
Valley Water Works and the extra price
of coal here. In New York the household
ers living in upper stories had to carry
the water upstairs or have it pumped.
The Mayor then reminded Mr. Schuss
ler of the investigation of 1890 and asked
Clerk Russeil to give the committee some
information on the subject. The clerk
stated that an investigation was held in
that year, but though regarded by the
board as thorough and complete, when
the committee came to fix the rates the
company desired to be heard again.
The board, however, was satisfied with
the scope oi the inquire, and refused to in
vestigate further. The company ap
pealed to the courts, and set up the ex
ception to the rate on the ground that the
investigation was not complete.
"As 1 understand," said the Mayor,
"the court declared that the rates would
stand after a full and fair investigation."
"It was a victory for both sides ; " replied
Mr, Russell, amid laughter.
The chairman asfced Engineer Schussler
how lone the overflow at Crystal Springs
had been going on.
The witness quoted the following figures:
On February 26 the water was a quarter of
an inch above the dam; March 1 the over
flow was three-quarters of an inch deep;
March 2, 3 inches; March 3, 5]4 inches;
March 4, 6% inches; March 5, &% inches;
March fi, 7 inches; March 7, 14}^ inches.
These figures were gradually reuueed to
2% inches on March 19. An inch deep
a Dove the dam represented an overflow of
I'-OO gallons, or for the whole width of the
dam about 3,000,000 gallons.
This subject was freely discussed and
reported at earlier stages of the investiga
tion.
The committee, on rising, decided to
resume the inquiry next Friday evening,
when the company will furnish some ad
ditional information, which will bring it
to a conclusion. Complaints against the
company will also be heard on that occa
sion.
Supervisor Britt moved the following
resolution :
Resolved, That the Board of Supervisors of
the City and County of Sau Francisco respect
fully requests the Senate of the State of Cali
fornia to submit Assembly constitutional
amendment No. 37 to the people, in oruer that
this City may be enabled to extricate its local
government from the utter confusion into
which it has been cast by conflicting laws and
the decisions of the courts ; a. so
Resolved, That the clerk of the board be
directed to transmit this resolution forthwith
by telegraph to the President of the Senate
and to the chairman of the San Francisco
Senate delegation.
The Mayor explained for the informa
tion of the board that the object of the
amendment was to enable the City to ob
tain a freeholders' or legislative charter
which would control not only the City
but also the county officers, thus remov
ing them from legislative interference.
They would no Jonger be affected by the
county government act. The board had
already indorsed ihe amendment, but as
the Legislature was on the point of ad
journing it was necessary to take imme
diate action, in order to brine the matter
before the people.
The resolution was carried and the board
adjourned. __^ _____

CYCLING CLUBS
WANT HOME RULE
Resolutions Are Introduced
Aiming at a Severancs
From the L A. W.
An Individual Association Pro
posed lor Cali
fornia.
It Is the Intention of the Local Clubs
to Take Fall Charge and Control
of All Races.
A special meeting of the board of gov
ernors of the California Associated Cycling
Clubs was held at the rooms of the Bay
City Wheelmen on Golden Gate avenue
last night.
The object ot the meeting was to form
an association by which all wheelmen,
whether they be club members or unat
tached, can be associated, irrespective of
any disability heretofore existing under
the laws regulating the L. A. W.
This step, while it did not express in so
many words a severance from the L. A.
VV.. meant much the same thing, and
from the temper and expressions of thei
members of the governing board itforajft
shadowed just such a course in the ne^
future.
Delegates H. F. Wynne, G. P. Wetmore
and F. W. Fuller were instrumental in
having the meeting called, And each in
turn spoke of the necessity for doing
something that would give the California
division junsdic tion over the management
and control of racing.
The plan proposed provided for an in
dividual association as an auxiliary to the
established club association. In order to
bringt he subject properly before the meet
ing Charles A. Adams of the Olympic Club
introduced the following preamble ana
resolutions, which were unanimously
adopted:
Whereas, The aims and purposes of the Cal
ifornia Associated Cycling Clubs and the
League of American Wheelmen are in spirit
and substance identical; and whereas, it ap
pears that there is great dissension in the
ranks ot the League of American Wheelmen,
and that great dissatisfaction exists in many
of the States, and particularly in the State
of California, because of the action of
the National Assembly in refusing local option
and the admission of professional riders, as
well also for other causes and reasons ; and,
whereas it appears that as a result thereoi there
is a probability of a new organiza
tion being formed to control racing
and racing interests by perioiis who are only
pecuniarily interested in bicycle racing; and
whereas, we believe that it isi or the best in
terest of cycle racing in this State that the
control thereof snouid rest with the organize!
clubs rather than with individuals; and
whereas, the California Associated Cycling
Clubs was organized for tne purpose, unions
others, of encouraging racing, both on the
path and the road; and whereas, we believe
that all the rights and privileges heretofore
obtained for and enjoyed by the members of
the L. A. W. could and should be obtained for
and enjoyed by the members of the California
Associated Cycling Clubs; therefore be it
Resolved, Tnat it is the sense of the Califor
nia Associated Cycling Clubs, expressed by its
board of governors, that the scope of the asso
ciation be broadened so as to include all the
objects and purposes of the L. A. W. ; that
provision be made for the admission Â«i mdl- i
viduals as well as clubs; and that no honor- A
able occupation be a bar to the admission or â 
any person of good character and otherwise 1
eligible and beyond criticism. And be it "
further
Resolved, That for the purpose of carrying
into effect the sense of the association, the
president appoint a committee of five to re
form the articles of association and by-lawc
of the California .Associated Cycling Clubs,
with instructions to report at the regular
meeting April 3. 1897.
Upon this committee the president ap
pointed C. A. Adams, Lew Hunter, T. J.
Winslow, R. M. Welch and V. A. Dodd.
Delegate Wetmora favored immediate
action by the association taking charge of
all racing, and to that end moved tbat
the president appoint a committee of
three to take charge.
Delegate Fuller feared that if this ac
tion were taken it would jeopardize the
standing of riders outside of the State, in
as much as the California association
had not, through its representatives, en
dorsed this step, and, as a consequence,
the riders would in all probability be ex
pelled and placed in an awkward predica
ment.
The members accepted this view of the
situation, and on the sugeestion of Repre
sentative Welch it was ordered that the sec
retary communicate with all the club
scretaries, requesting them to refrain from
asking racine privileges until after the
regular April meeting of tne association.
The question of pool-selling at the com
ing race in the Pavilion was discussed, but
no definite action was taken. The subject
will be taken up at the regularmeetinp:,
however, and from the expressions let
drop it is almost certain that no pools will
be permitted inside the building.
