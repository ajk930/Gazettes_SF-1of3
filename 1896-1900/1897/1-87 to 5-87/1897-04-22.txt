us far the fortunes of war have been with the Moslem. The
defeat of King George's forces in Thessaly is serious in its conse
quences. Added to the loss of 3lilouna Pass, the Christians have been
eed to abandon Turnova to the Turks. This has opened the way
to Larissa for Edhem Pasha's force, and Larissa, th; Greek head
quarters in Thessaly, is now besieged by the Turks.

warships to avoid a conflict. Th- Hellenic Eastern squadron has re
duced and captured Platomona, a town in Macedonia, just over the
borders of Thessaly. It is the intention of the commander of the fleet
to attack all coast towns of importance northward until Salonica is
reached.
The Cireeks have captured Fillipiada, in Epirus. Before evacuat

GREEK REVERSES.
Edhem Pasha's Force Clears the
Way to the Larissa Head-
quarters.
LONDON, Enc;., April 21.â There is no
longer any doubt that the disaster that
has befallen the Greek army in Thessaly
is overwhelmins and irretrievable. The
Turkish army, under command of Edhem
Pasha, is not only in i :>sse?sion of Milo
una Pass, but has captured Tyrnova, the
only obstacle on the road to Larissa, the
headquarters of the Greek army.
The latest reports indicate that the lat
ter place is invested by the Turks. The
Greek forces in the viciniiy of Laris*a are
stated to be in full retreat. It Larissa is
taken (and as it is not fortified there
seems to be nothing to prevent its falling
into the hands of the Moslems) the whole
scheme of Greek frontier delense collapses.
There is no second line of defense on the
hills of Thessaly and unless the Greeks
make a stand on the broad plains against
superior numbers the whole province
must be abandoned.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.
The next line of delense in ancient times
was Thermopylae, but the pass at Tner
mopylae has disappeared, and alluvial de-
Dosits from the river Spercheiog make a
bioad plain where once the sea washed al
mo3l against the mountain. With
Thessaly lost, the next stand can be made
only at Tlieb?s, but nobody believes
Europe will allow the Turks to carry the
invasion bo far.
It is practically certain that Ed hem
Pasha will not advance beyond Larissa
until he has dealt with the large Greek
force which are still hghting wit:i much
success at Bogatzi and Reveni. and which
would seriously threaten his flank and
rear.
There is stil! much tighting to be done
before the Turkscan pu-h on to Athens. It
is apparent to everybody that the Greeks
are badly led, and the effect of this lack of
efficient commanders upon the troops is
already disheartening. Thisaione almost
ensures a continuance of Turkish victories
and the inglorious collapse of the Greek
cause. Th.' same effect has already been
produced on the friends of Greece

PLATOMONA REDUCED.
Greece's Eastern Squadron Suc
cessful In Its Bombardment
of the Town.
ATHENS, Greece, April 21.â 1t was re
ported this afternoon that the eastern
squadron of the Greek fleet was bombard
ing Platomona, on the western side of the
Gulf of Salonica, in Macedonia, just over
the border from T.ies-aly. A dispatch
this evening says the bombardment has
been successful. A force was landed from
the Greek warships alter the Turks had
been compelled to evacuate the fort com
manding the town. The Greeks occupied
the fort, seizing and destroying a consid
erable aaantity of munitions of war. which
the Moslems were obliged to sacrifice in
their flight.
The east?rn squadron, which is oper
ating in the Quit of Salonica will, it is
said to-night, proceed northward from
Patomona to bombard Letbokarya, after
which a naval attack will be made on
Katarina, a little further north.
From present indication* it appears to
be the inteniion of the commander of the
fleet to attack all coast towns of any im
portance northward until Salon ica is
reached. Critics of naval operations de
clare the first attack should have Leen
made upon Salonica, the capture of which
would have meant the cutting off of the
supplies of the Turkish army in the field
which was us ng Salonica as its principal
base.
DUEL OF ARTILLERY.
Greek Gunners Silence a Turkish
Battery or Four Pieces
at Arta.
CORFU, Greece. April 21.â Details have
reached here of a fiercely contested artil- 1
J lery duel, which took plac* at Arta on
Monday, between the Greet hill batteries
behind Arta and the Turkish batteries
across the river Artinos.
Three > f four Turkish batteries were
silenced in the earlier hours of the en
i garment, and, after six hours' fighting,
j the fourth battery, consisting of six gunÂ«,
i under command of a Geimaa officer, was
! compelled to ce:ise firing.
Tlie Greek batteries ngereeated fifteen
I euns. The gunners of both sides stood
j stubbornly to their work. The Greeks
, poured a hailstorm of shells into the
i woods across the r; v cr to dislodge the
Turkish infantry before they began their
adTance. The Turks retreated at sunset
, and 40,000 Greek in iantry, with a squad
ron of cavalry and a battery of field artil
i lery, crossed the river early Tuesday
J morning.
Near the mouth of the river on the
i Turkish side the Turks were overtaken
j and a sharp battle ensued, in which the
losses on both sides were very heavy.
The Greeks scored a slight advantage, but
the result was indecisive. Shells from
the Turkish batteries wrecked the Lome
of 100 Greeks.

Despite the Turkish reDorts that the at

the entrance of the Gulf of Arta, had
been abandoned, it was declared this
evening that a heavy bombardment is
still going on.
At 8 p. sc. this dispatch from Crown

of the GreeK forces, was made public:
"Every road by which the Turks can de

The Crown Prince's dispatch also said:
"We have kept all our positions. Situa

The Greek Government is straining
every nerve to put into the fk>ld eveiy

attempt to drive the Turks from Thessaly.
The gravity of the situation is fully rec

Salonika has but one line of railroad, which run* up the Vardar River to Usknb

HAVANA, Cuba, April 21.â Advices
have just been received of a remarkable
ten-day battle in Puerto Principe Prov*
ince, in which nearly 1000 Spaniards were
tilled.
Early on the morning of April 2 Spanish
Colonel RiRO met a strong Cuban detach
ment near Puerto Principe City. He sent
cavalry to surround it, but this force was
soon repulsed by another Cuban force
ambushed in the estate Las Dehcas. The
Spanish commander then marched to a
neighboring estate called El Silencio and
there withstooa the fire from the insur
gents all day, answering their volleys with
the Spanish now-improved rifles. At
night the tiring ended and the insureenta
retired to Los Caciques, a small village a
half-mile from El Silencio.
April 3, at noon, the Spanish reached
Los Caciques, and after two hours' con
stant tiring the insurgents retired again,
this time to the estate La Esperanza, six
miles from Puerto Principe.
Encouraged by his success Colonel Rizo
marched on La Esperanza also, reaching
it at 5 P. M.. and opening a sharp tire.
The further he advanced into the estate
the more numerous he found the Cubam,
who were tiring on his column from all
sides. He attempted to dislodge one of
their detachments from a hill by a bayonet
charge, but was repulsed with heavy loss.
As the insurgents' cavalry force had
been considerably re-enforced the Span*
iards formed a square to escape annihila
tion. In this position they were Bur
rounded. With the opposing forces fifty
yards apart heavy tiring was exchanged
throughout the night.
At dawn on April 4 Rizo succeeded in
breaking tne Cuban lines and escaping to
the estate of Los Cocos, the Cubans hotly
pursuing. The Spanish rear guard
answered the Cuban fire until the Guayabo
estate was reached, but it was dispersed
and the main body had to resist a new
attack.
The Spaniards were then very tired and
had lost 300 men. For three days, not
withstanding they were exhausted, they
fought in Guayaba, and then fled to tha
estate Los Botcnes and were fortunately
met by re-enforcements under Colonel
Cruz Gonzales.
Of Rizo's command, which numbered
1500 men when it started from Puerto
Principe, only 1000 entered Los Bo tones.
On the retreat to Puerto Principe the
Spaniards were constantly compelled to
stop to defend themselves in hind-to-hand
tielits. They entered Puerto Princice oa
April 12 totally defeated, after leaving 800
killed along the route.
DEPARTURE OF AN ASSESSOR.
Perhaps ihe Mystery Con Be Explained by
the Corporations Who Ware Alarmed
by H s Honesty.
OMAHA, Xebr., April 21.â Samuel
Brighara, the Assessor for Souib Omaha,
rushed into the office of the County Clark
to-day just before the regular time for
closing, and handed in his re-ugnation.
In a rather excitable manner Brigham
stated that he had been offered a position
with an oil concern in New York city at a
big salary, and was obliged to leave for
the East at oncp. He was asked to re
main in the city long enoush to certify to
tun records and assessments made up by
him to the date of his resignation, but be
said he did not have time to do that, and
suggested that the matter be taken up
by his chief deputy.
With this he went out, and is supposed
to have left the city. Aside from tho
legal difficulties arisiDg irom this sudden
leaving of Brigham, there is an element
of mydiery surrounding the whole affair.
At the meeting of Assessors of the county,
Brigbam made a fiery speech, in which ha
announced bis intention of "making tho
assessment according to law," regardless
of what the other Assessors might do.
The first day he started at the work te
found property worth $750,000 which had
never been assessed at ail, and he related
other instances where he had found large
holdings which had never bsen assessed.
He estimated that the total valuation of
the taxable prouerty of South Omaha
would be increased to over $12,000,000.
This is ten times the amount of property
previously assessed, and many of the
wealthy corporations declared they would
be ruined, Now Brigham's work is in

quire of Senator White somethine about
the different applicants for tne Circuit
Judgeship to succeed McKenna.
The opinion of White was sought as a
Democrat who might have no partiality
for any of the candidates. Senator White
warmiy praised Judge Morrow, and said
that in his opinion Morrow was the
man for the place. This was the first time
Senator White had ever met President
MoKinley. Dur ; ng their brief interview
it was impossible for Senator White to
gain even an idea of the President's choice
for the Circuit Juilge?hip. but he is in
clined to believe that McK:nley has two
names under confederationâ Morrow and

Senator White said to The Call corre

that in view of the emphatic telegrams and
letter which Secretary Alger has received
from Southern Caliiornia he will not dare
to lurther delay the execution of the act
of Congress and Will advertise for bids. If
he does not do so White will inuoduce a

Colonel J. F. Evans of San Francisco to
day appeared before tne sub-committee of
finance, which has the tariff bill under
consideration, and pr?sen:ed additional
reasons why a draw back should be allowed
on coal used by American vessels. He
showed the committee that the drawback
provision in the shipping act of ISB6 was
intended to be continued by the tariff act
of 1890, but owing to the unskillful word
in- of thedrawback clause of that act the
Supreme Court held that said clause was
not unad enough to include coal. The
difference in the price of coal on the
Pacific as compared with the Atlantic
coast was shown to be more than 100 per
cent, and the fact that high-priced im
ported caal is used almost exclusively for
steaming purposes by the Pacific Coast
steamers was especially a welt upon.
He said that it in addition to this great
expense for coal, the vessels of the coast
must also be taxed 75 cents per ton, with
no relief by way of drawback, it would
operate as a discrinnna'.ion against the
shipping of California and other Pacific
Stnte", and would be a just cause of com
plaint.
Colonel Evans contends that this is a
Pacific question, pure and simply, and
that the drawback will not injure the coal
interests of the East, the price being regn
iated on'this side by the dome-tic supply.
If the foreign coal comes in its price must
conform to the local rate and the foreign
shipper must pay the duty. It is a dog
in-the-manger policy then for the Eastern
coal magnates to oppose the drawback to
which they never before objec cd.
The probability is that anthracite coal
will be subjected to the shin â¢ rate of duty
as bituminous coal, the line of distinction
between the so-called anthracite and Brit
ish Columbia coal being almost impossi
ble of definition.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 21.-MB.ny
men have received big fees for making
speeches, but it has remained for Senator
Perkins to receive a handsome reward for
preserving a golden silence on last Satur

Digger Indians in California upon lands
recently purchased for them and for their
subsistence and civilization, and for tbe
i purchase of farming Implements, seeds,
aud other article 1 :, including the pay of a
practical farmer, $3j00."
Mr. Perkins, in presenting this addition,
offered to make a speech, whereupon
(Senator Pettigrew implored the Caiilor
nian not to do so, promising to let tbe
amendment pass if he would desist. Mr.
Perkins then said: "It was my purpose
to explain the provision, but my friend
from South Dakota says to mo that if I
do not make a speech he will accept the
amendment. Therefore lam very glad to

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 21.â
international chess match between mem
bers ot the British Parliament and the
American House of Representatives will
probably begin immediately after the ad
journment of Parliament, which is ex
pected about the middle of May. The
preliminaries are being arranged by Hon.
J. Henniker Heaton, M. P., and Rich
mond Pearson, member of Congress from
North Carolina. A letter tc-day from
Heaton, giving the names of the British
team, has unset the American manager's
plans. It proposes that the contest be
conducted in a simultaneous match at
five tables, one player to be in charge of
each table, with two assistants to advise.
Following is the list of English players
end assistants: Players â Strauss, Hon.
Horace Plunkett, John Parne'.J, Atchieley
Jones, F. W. Wilson or Charles Shaw.
Assistantsâ Lord Folkestone, Sir Herbert
Maxwell, Allhusen, McKenna, J. Henni
ker Heaton. Lord Balcarres. Seton Kar,
Lord Warkworth, Bromley Davenport,
Dalbiac.
The Congressional experts prefer a se
ries of individual matches, but they will
a^ree to play under the British plan
rather than have the affair fail. The
members of the American team will ba
named in a few days.

MASON'S CAUSTIC
MAIDEN SPEECH
The New Illinois Sena
tor Would Amend
the Rules.
How the Country's Business
Is at the Mercy of
Minorities.
He Believes In Scraping the Bar
nacles From the 3hlp of
State.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 21.â The
monotony of the Senate was interrupted
to-day by an attack DPOO the rules by one
of the new Senators, Mason (R.) of Illi
nois. He had offered a resolution yester
day for an amendment to the rules pro
viding for the limitation of debate and
the ordering of the previous question.
When the resolution was taken Bp to-day
he made his maiden speech,. treating the
subject with levity. Instead of the Sen
ate being the great assembly Senators im
agined it to be, it was practically, he said,
only a legislative body in the country
where a minority transacted pub ie busi
ness. Alluding to the tariff Dill as a
measure in which the majority would
have to yield to the minority, he remarked
that the business interests of the country
were on the va>g3 of despondency. He
cave the arbitration treaty as another il
lustration of the minority deciding
whether or not it shouid be ratified. The
Cuban matter was another instance.
"Action upon it," he said, "is delayed
while murder is committed at our very
doorsteps, and we look each other in the
face and say, 'Am I my brother's keeper?'
The Senator from Alabama knows there is
a majority in this body committed to roc
ognize belligerent riphts in Cuba, but
whatever our desire the minority controls
our action. I would not scuttle the ship,
but would like to put her in the drydock
lone enough to have her bottom scraped
so that we can sail and transact public
business. Senators say they are in favor
of a change individually. Let them show
that they are colleciiveiy."
Hoar remarked that there was very little
likelihood of the Committee on Rules act
ing soon on the resolution, as Chairman
Aldrich was engajred day and ni^ht in the
preparation of the tariff bill. He spoke
with some bitterness of the methods of
another parliamentary body (alluding to
the House) that adjourned every three
days in order to gain time for attacks
upon the Senate for not attending to bus.
ness. [Laughter.]
Gorman moved to refer the resolution to
the Committee on Rules.
Mason said he preferred to have the
resolution acted upon directly and de
manded the ayes and noes.
Gorman's motion was adopted â ages 32,
noes 24.
A petition of merchants and commer
cial bodies of San Francisco against the
abrogation of Hie Hawaiian treaty was
presented by Perkins anci one in faVor of
its adoption by Morrill of Vermont.
The amendment appropriating $50,000
for the improvement of P^arl Harbor was
reported from the Committee oa For. i,n
Relations.
An invitation to the Senate to be pres
ent at thÂ« Grant ceremonies in New York
and to take part in the exercises was ac
cepted, on motion of lluwley, and a com
mittee of fifteen to represent the Senate
on that occision was ordered appointed
by the Vice-President.
A concurrent resolution to adjourn over
from Monday. April 2G. to Monday, May
3, offered by Chandler, went over without
action.
The bankruptcy bill was then taken up.
Various verbal amendments were made
to Nelson's substitute. 1 urpie opposed
thÃ Dill because it would allow a joint
stock corporation to gÂ»> into voluntary or
invo.untary bankruptcy.
Hoar, who a^ists Lindsay in the man
ngement of the bill, ruodiiied the bill sn
that it would not include corporations. It
was agreed to begin voting on the pend

NEW YORK.^ S. V., April 21.â News of
another revolution in Honduras arrived
10-day on the American fruit-carrying
ship Foxball from Puerto Cortez. The
Foxhall was tied up to the only pier at
Puerto Cortez, on which the custom-bouse
of the port is built, on the night of April
1\ when about forty men armed with
Winchesters and carrying boxes came
down to the pier and asked Captain Leslie
to defer sailing until they found out
whether or not the reel forces under Gen
eral Desoto, former President of Hon
duras, were going to attack them. They
intimated that it wouivi not go well with !
them if a.tt-r ali :h: they should be cap- >
tureJ, and they wanted to get away on tte I
Foxhall.
It was surmised that the things in boxes
they carried were customs receipts and
other funds, which frequently cause revo
lutions in Central American republics.
Leslie Mid that he was under orders to
sail ai y o'clock at night, and he cast off
the lines promptly at that hour. Before
doing so he learned that the nkht before
the lebels under De.Â«oto had capturpd a
garrison commanded by a German officer
in the barracks on a lagoon just nor. beast
ol Puerto Cortez. The rebels got six can
nons and -\ lot of rifles and ammunition.
Chief Oftker Krojasgard of the Foxhall
said that he ad hear* from men a>hori*
the night before the Fox':all sailed that
there had been a general uprising in the
republic, and that President Bonilla had
decided to accept the aid of Guatemala,
Salvador and Nicaragua to suppress the
rebellion. There was no disorder or tiring
on shore when the Foxhall steamed out
into the gulf of Honduras.

Liquid Produce tha Grand

Â«
NEW YORK, N. V., April 21.-Some
photographs in colors of nature were ex
hibited on Broadway to-day. Th-y were
taken in France Dy the recently discov
ered process of Ville.lieu Chassagne of
Paris, and while coloring media are used'
they are roraarkably successful efforts in
this new field of photography. All sorts
of views are reproduced, and the most
minute variations in color indicated in
the completed photograph. The color of
flesh, varying shades of foliage and colors
of jewels or raetaia are distinctly shown.
A plate that has been submitted to certain
treatment is osed, and after that exposure
and development are accomplished in the
ordinary way. The media supplying the
color are applied after the print is fin
ished.
Four liquids are used â one colorless,
the other three being blue, green and red.
The colorless liquid is applied to the
print with a camelshair bru>h. IÂ», ia
supposed to give the print selective power.
Blue, green and red are successively ap
p:ied, with the application of the colorless
liquid between every u-e of the blue and
green. After each application the print is
wiped dry. From the blue, green and
red solutions applied the print takes the
colors of the original, altnough none of
thf-e three may have been separately
present in the original view. Neither
water nor turpentine will wash off the
color. The liquids which produce these
results will be placed on tbe market by
July. The solutions and treatment to
which tbe plate is submitted are secrets of

NEW METHOD OF TELEGRAPHY.
.4 Recent Discovery Promises a Speed of
3000 Ho,- us Per Minute Over a
Sinj/e Wre.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 21.â Before
the American Society of Mechanical En
gineers to-nicht Professor Albert Crehore
of Dartsmouth College read a Daper de
scribing a new method of very rapid tele
graphing by use of alternating currents,
which will be developed by him and Lieu
tenant George Owen Squier of the United
States army. The experiments which re
sulted in the development of the nex
system were made at the United States
Artillery School, Fort Monroe, Va.
The average telegraph operator, sending
messages by ihe Morse system, can trans
mit from thlrtv to forty words per minute.
By the Wheatstone system, where mes
sages are first prepared on a puncher-strip
and then transmitted automatically, a
speed of from 150 to 200 words per minute
may be attained. By the new system
promised a speed of 3uCO words per minute
may be attained over a single wire.
At the same time the wire cou d be used
for sending other messages by the ordi
nary Morse system, or by the quadruple
system, without creating any interference.
It is also possible to send two entirely
different messages over the same line at
the same time at the late of 3000 words
per minute, and in addition these mes
sages could be transmitted to and received
by any number of stations at the same in
stant and recorded automatically. It is
necessary to have the messages prepared
for sending on slips of paper, punched
with signals to represent letters in accord
ance with the European modification of
the Morse code.
The general method by which this won
derful speed is to be accomplished is by
taking advantage of the peculiarity of al
ternating currents, iv whicb currents of
opposite polarity succeed Â«?a' h other with
a rapidity varying Jrom 250 to 400 per
second. Between each pair of these waves
of current is a moment when the wire is
neutral.
By means of a simple device these cur
rents may be interrupted, and one or
more wave movements of current omitted,
liy noting these interruptions and their
order messages can be read by the use of a
sensitive needle or flashlight.
MACE WOULD FIGHT SULLIVAN.
Prospect for a Batt.e Be ween the Od
Fellows and a Joint Tour
Through England.
BOSTON*, Mass , April 21â Jem Mace,
the old English ex-champion, is in town
to-day trying to arrange with Frank Dunn
for a match with John L. Sullivan fora
limited number of rounds. The place will
be in some Eastern city, probably Boston
or New York. If he fails in this he will
endeavor to arrange for a meeting with
the veteran, MiÃe Donovan, the boxing
instructor, before a big New York ath
letic club. These two old fellows sparred
four interesting round* in New York
some months azo and did so well that tue
sporting fraternity is more than anxious
to have them box again.
It is understood that Donovan is very
willing to meet Mace. Failing in this.
Mace wi 1 sail for England from New
York on the Campania next Saturday.
Sullivan is going to England next fall
and Mace wishes to make arrangements
to travel with him givintr boxing exhibi
tions in the bit; cities, which lie thinks
would make a pot of money for both men.
The Snorting Review announces that
John L. Sullivan and Jem Mac? have ar
ranged a partnership and will tour Eng
land the coming summer.

Make Off to a Canyon With

They Cut the Telegraph Wires, but
Armed Miners Are Now In
Pursuit.
SALT LAKE, Utah, April 21.â E. L.
Carpenter, paymaster of the Pleasant Val
ley coal mines, left Salt Lake this morn
ing to i>ay off the miners at Castle Gate.
He took with hini $9SOO in three packages,
two of them containing $1000 each ia sil
ver, and the other $7800 in gold and green
back. The Rio Grande Western train
reached that rather isolated portion of
T'tah about 12 :Jt> o'clock this afternoon.
With another employe of the company
Carpenter alighted from the train and was
soon in the presence of one hundred or
more men who were loitering about the
store which was but a lew rods from the
station.
The passenger train pulled out and a
moment later two rough looking individ
uals, who iiad been loitering around town
and in the saloon all day, were seen to ap
proach Carpenter and his assistant.
As they were about to ascpnd the out
side stair* leading to the company's office
on the second tioor of tne store one of
them thrust a revolver in Carpenter's face
and called upon him to "Drop those sacks
and hold up your hands." Carpenter did
both with alacrity as toe second footpad
appeared on the scene with a similar re
quest. The latter poured lead into the
air in a very promiscuous fashion and
caused the greatest consternation, the
hundred or so brave miners fleeing to the
east and to the west, to the north and to
the south.
Tlse robber who made th? first demand
picked up the money and handed it to his
pal, who immediately started down the
canyon. The horse belonging to the fel
low who made the tirst demand got away,
and he had some difficulty in catching it,
but, in the meantime, the other fellow
got safely away.
Daring the excitement Carpenter suc
ceeded in getting into the store with one
s-ack of coin containing $1000, and acoth r
sack of silver was either dropped or
thrown away by the fleeing robber and
was picked up a short distance away, but
the satchel containing greenbacks and
gold amounting to $7800 was successfully
male away with.
Every man in Bight was so badly fright
ened thai no move was made to intercept
tne robb?rs until both had disappeared.
Then noises were armed, aud a diligent
s-earch is now being medc.
A reward of $1000 has been offered for
the capture of Die men and $iOOO for the
return of the money. The robbers are j
.supposed to be "Buich" Cassidy and Tom ,
I. we.'i-known members of a gacs; of
toughs which frequents a desolate and
isolaicl port-on of the Ban Rafitel country
known as the "Kobbers' Roost."
The robbers had taken the precaution
to cut the telegraph wires between several
stations, and this gave them quite an ad
vantage. If they ever reach the San
Rafael country it is not believed they can
be captured.
HUNGRY MEN INVADE STOCKTON.
An Arm/ of Unemployed Landed by Steam
irs From T is C/lyâG yen Food They
S art for Sacramento.
ETOCKTON, Cal., April 21.-Two
hundred and fifty unemployed men
landed hungry in this city this morning.
'Ihey came up from San Francisco by the
steamers Dauntless and Mary Garratt,
a: d their iransportation was paid thither
by San Franciscans to get rid of them.
The men were unable to obtain employ
ment on the boulevard in the metropol s,
and they are bound for the country along
the Missouri and Mississippi rivers^ which
has Miffered great damage by the recent
floods. S. A. Letfingweli, who has been
j resident of the unemployed in San Fran
cisco since the movement was organized,
is m the head of the wandering idle.
Mayor Baegs offered to furnish 250
loaves of br^ad, provided tbÂ«Â» army would
march for Sacramento, but that did not
quite satisfy the leader. He said that for
a two days' tramp they would need more
bread, besides .'ome bacon, coffee, sugar
etc. '
It was finally agreed that the provisions
would be supplied, and the Mayor and
the Chief jr. ye the industrials 100 pounds
of bacon. 600 pounds of beans, 20 pounds
of coffee, 500 loaves of bread and Â« quan
tity of crackers. They promised to start
for the capital city at once.
The leaders intend to desert the unem
ployed at L->di. They told Chief Kings
b lry this. If any others are ?ent from
baa Francisco they will not fare so well,
as lhe people of Stockton are indignant at
San Francsco for making this city the
dump;nK-^round for their unemployed.
Stocaon is taking care of its own poor,
bui it does not propose to feed those of
lhe metropolis.
SACRAMENTO, April 21.â Considerable
excitement exist! throughout the city to
night tbroaga the published report that
a body of 250 0f the unemployed men of
Ban Frer.tivco, having been Janded by
steamer at Stockton, are marching en
masse townri tins city. Thereport claims
that the Mayor and" Chief oi Police of
Stockton haii suppiied the men with two
days' Droviiions with the understanding
th:it they would immeiliatelv start for
Sacramento on foot, and that this had
l.enn agreed to.
M <yor Hubbar.i and Chief of Police M.
M. Drew of this ciiv both say that they
do not asyei know what sten's they will
taKL- in case the army reaches Sacramento,
but they claim they need not expect any

MURDER AT FRENCH CAMP.
Qne Trcmp Killed by Another During on
Altercationâ A Young Lady Witnesses
â he Tragedy.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 21.â Shortly be
fore 6 o'clock this evening Miss Russell,
who rev.des witli J. J. Borland at French
Cam p. saw two men on tue railroad tracks
near that place in an altercation. They
were tramps who had bee.i seen near the
French Camp Hospital for some days past,
b:u no one who lives there seems to know
who they are. iliss Kussell saw the
younger man strike the man he was with,
aiiil the latter fell backward on the rail
road track. As he did bo the blow must
have broken his neck, as when iie was
picked up by those who saw the affair he
w.-i iL-a.i and hi.-rnecK was broken.
The man who was killed was aoout 55
years of age, but theie was nothing on his
person to indicate who be w*s or where he
came irom. Neither is there any clew to
the identity of Ins assailant. Sheriff Cun
nincbam and Deputy Sheriff Wall want
to French Camp ao soon as they learned
of the killing, but they could find no trace
of the man who struck the old man who
was found lying dead across the railroad
track. The body of the dead ma:i was
brought to tho morgue here by Deputy
Coroner Jory, but there 'ttas nothing on
the body to indicate who he was.
KNOCKED OUT AT SAN JOSE.
â¢Km" Evans Receives a Blow That May
Result in Dea h â His Antago
nist in Prison.
BAN JOSE, Cal.. April 21â Matt
Semlchy, a local iightweieht pugilist, is
occupying a cell in the County Jail as the
result of a boxing contest at the opening
exhibition of the San Jose Athletic Club
held in this city to-ni^ht. Frank Evans,
better known as "Kid' 1 Evans, his an
tagonist, has concussion of the brain and
has been lying unconscious since he re
ceived the knock-nut blow.
The contest was announced as a fifteen
round go. Semichy made a rushing fight
from the start, and was looked on as a
sure winner after the first four rounds. A
squad of police was present, but as the
gloves used were extra large it was
thought that the filters could not seri
ously injure each other, and tne contest
was'allowed to proceed. Evans fought a
game up-hill battle and occasionally made
surprising rallies.
The knock-out came early in the four
teenth round.
Semichy caught Evans near the point
of the chin with a right-hand blow, knock
ing him off his feet. Evans' head struck
the hardwood tioor with a resounding
bump. Alter Evans had been counted
out he was carried to the dressing-room,
and a physician summoned. It was found
that the deieated pugilist was badly in
jured. There is a severe concussion of
the br:tin, aud at this time, over an hour
after the tight, Evans is still unconscious.
Semichy was at once placed under arrest
and will be kept in confinement pending
the outcome of Evans' injuries.
SUING FOR MOODY'S GULCH OIL
Accounting Demanded by Ranchers Who
Leased Their Lands to a
S/ndicate.
BAN JOSE, Cal., April 21.â Suit was
brought to-day by David B. Moody, Addie
M. Hubbard r.nd Martha. T. Moody against
Charles J. Ellis and C. C. Mclver for an
accounting as to oil extracted from weils
in Moody's Gulch, near Los Gates, by the
defendants, and which the plaintiffs claim
has not been accounted for.
It is set forth in the complaint that in
October, 1878, the Santa C.ara Petroleum
Company entered inio an agreement with
Volney D. Moody and Charles Moody to
work the wells of the plaintiff , in Moody's
Gulch in the Santa Cruz Mountains lor a
period of ten years. The plaintiffs were
to receive as compensation one-tenth of
the petroleum cr coal oil extracted from
the wells and a statement to be furnished
by the defendants to the plaintiffs on the
15th of each month for the quantity of oil
extracted. The contract, was subse
quently renewed for another ten years.
It is believed by the plaintiffs that the
def*ndams have extracted !nrge amounts
of the oil fince June '25, ISGO, up to the
present time. The number of barrels ex
tracted ihercla.mto be IGO per month,
worth $2 75 each. They claim that no
statement has been made to them show
ing the quantity of oil extracted and ttat
no part of their one-tenth share of the
product has been delivered, except $26tj
worth.
The plaintiffs sue for an accounting and
ask thiit a receiver bo put in charge of the
premises. A temporary injuncnon wfcs
issued by the court atad Smith Peck was
appointed rpeeiver on giving a bond in
the sum of $1000.

PLOT TO INJURE
A STATE OFFICIAL
The Secretary of State
Accused of Riding
on a Pass.
His Pullman Slips Said to
Have Been Tampered
With.
Believes the Attack Upon Him
Comes From a Personal
Enemy*
6ACRAMENTO. Cal, April 21.â 1t i<
claimed that an attempt has been made
to injure Secretary of State Brown by
trying to prove that during his recent trip
to the East on business connected with
the methods of conducting Stato institu
tions there, he traveled on a pass, and
afterward charged his expenses to the
State.
It is said that recently some friends of a
discharged employe of the Capitol went
to {secretary Brown and toid him that it
was bsing said that during his trip east
ward he had been traveling on an annual
pass, and ;hat his vouchers for Piulruan
car slips would show this to bo the fact.
ThW aroused Secretary Browns sus
picions and he immediately went to the
Controller's othce and requt :ed to see
the expense account of bis trio, and in ex
am ning the voucher* attached it wns
found that they had been tampered with
and that all ttie I'jllman slips had been
punched in two places, once in the space
showing regular fare had been paid and
the other in the space headed "'Annual
Pass" â the latter having been made with
s. different size nunch from the other
holes in the slips.
Mr. Brown's anger was aroused and he
immediately instituted a searching inves
tigation, which it is c. aimed has resulted
in discovering that the suspected ex-em
ploye had been seeu in the Controller's
i.ilice with a punch in Us possession ; that
he t>ad been seen examining the vouch
ers attuc oil to the expense account of
Secretary of State Brown; that he bad
called attention to the fact of the punch
hois in the annual pass space and that be
bud attempted to get photographs- taken
of these slips, but that no positive in
formation could be arrived at proving
conclusively that be had personally made
thÂ«> bogus holes In the slips.
When interviewed on ihe subject this
evening Secretary of State Brown said:
"I hat an attenint has been made to prove
that I, a State official, had been traveling
on n paÂ«s in the Eastern Stales while
making a tour of Eastern asylums ami
pri-ons is tru j beyond a possible doubt,
but (but there is anything in the story \n
that effect is absurd; and furthermore, I
had four traveling companions with me,
ah of whom can and will testify that I
purchased my tickets tin; same as* any one
else. I will acknowledge that this at
tempted dasttrdly attack has provoked
me greatly ami mat I have been investi
gating the matter closely and am fully
satiMiÂ»d in my own amd who the perpe
trator oi it is and what his motive i?, but
a 9 sure as the sun shines it will react
against himself.
"1 have been informed that the scheme
originated with a former railroad em
ploye, woo resides in San Francisco, but
1 am not prepared to mention any names
at the present time, aud I can only say
that there is nothing whatever in t!:e
story except that an attempt has been
made to prove that I was violating that
section of ihe statutes which prohibits
any State olhcial from traveling on passes,
excent the Railroad Commissioners.
"This attempted attack may ari/e from
political motives, but 1 am more inclined
to believe that it is a strictly private move
on the p;in of the guilty individual."

I MARIN OFFICER'S ADVENTURE.
Rows for Life in a Leaking Boat and
Wins the Race With but a Few
Seconds io Spare.
SAUSALITO. Cal., April 21.â Under
I Sheriff John Harmon, wnile engaged in
t official business last night, had a thrilling
i and perilous experience in which he al
! most lost his life.
Hannon, who is one of the most popular
officials connected with Marln County's
government, left Sausalito in a Whitehall
i boat to serve a legal document on a man
I liviug in Belvedere, just across the bay
from Sausalito. lie rowed across Richard
sons Bny without incident and pulled up
un the Belvedere siJe. After dragging his
liont on the beach he walked over the
| hill into Belvedere, where he finished his
| business with all possible haste and re
-1 turned to the boat.
During his ab-ence some person may
I have tampered with the cra:t, for when
' the Under Sheriff was out in the rniUdle
! of the bay, between Sausalito and Belve
dere, the Whitehall commenced leaking.
The wcter gradually poured in and Har
mon saw that it meant a race for life.
! His first impulse was to cry for assistance.
; in the hope that Mis cries might attract
; the attention of some of the men on the
ships riding at anchor in the buy. In ti.is
lie was not successful. The nigh i was dark
mid a slight breeze carried the sound of
his voice away from the vessel.
The Under Sheriff then reÂ«olved to make
efforts to reacii Sausalito. He exerted all
the strength in his muscles and the oars
| bent beneath the strain. Onward the
; leuking boat sped over the waters toward
| the glimmering electric lights on the wa
ler front of Sausalito. It was a struegle
: against wind, tide and water, and it
i seemed as though the officer was the loser.
"When 1 finally ran the boat on the
! beach at Sausaiito. " said Mr. Hannon this
1 evening, "iho water was up to the gun
i wales and would have sunk the craft bad
I been live minutes longer in it. It was
one of the worst experiences I have ever
bad. Tiio water commenced to leak in
when 1 was in the middle of Richardson*
B iy, and I thought my day had come. I
never worked so hard in my life, and when
I ran the boat on the beach you can bet I
breathed a sigh of relief."

DIVORCED AT TACOMA.
Decree of Separation Granted to Dr.
Harrison, a Cousin of the Duke
of Fife.
TACOMA, Wash., Anril 21.â Dr. Robert
Harold Harrison, cousin of the Duke of
Fife, was to-day granted a divorce from
Blanche Harrison on statutory grounds,
Ralph Moore of Charleville, County Cork,
Ireland, being named as co-respondent.
The case has been of special interest from
the fact that the plaintiff is the well
known chief surgeon of the Asiatic liner
Victoria, now in port The defendant is
prominently connected with London
(England) social ci rcles, while it is reported
that the co-respondent is a captain in the
royal navy.
The Harrisons were married in Dublin,
Ireland, in July, 1884, and have one child,
who was born in April, 1885. Mr. Har
rison sued for possession of this child,
alleging that ms wife was not a tit person
to have charge of her.
Evidence was introduced here to show
that in 1800 uivorce proceedings were
brought by Dr. Harrison in the Court of
Chancery in Dublin on statutory grounds,
and although the allegations of the bill
were proved, the court granted a legal
separation only, which does not authorize
either of the parties an absolute divorce,
an act of Parliament being necessary to
effect absolute divorce under the laws of
Ireland. Dr. Harrison has made his
home at Tacorna for the past six years.

An Unrivaled Spectacle Sweeps
Majestically Before the Queen i

LOSANGELKS, Cat. , April 21.â The
good and beautiful Franceses, queen of
festivity and merry-making, made good <
â use of the golden key to the city's gates
putioto her keeping last night. She sim
ply turned it in the Jock, allowed the
pates to swing back and declared the city
'â¢wide open."
With this morning began the revel, and i
it runs at its pure bent and without re- j
straint. The first shaft of the hot south- !
crn sun was haiied by a thunder of con- i
non such as roused, not only the queen j
and her ministers and her gay court, but
ail her glad subjects, to a realization that
they should be up and about their busi
ness of having fun.
Very shortly afterward the streets began I
to fili up with the devotees of pleasure. !
Men in origin costumes tailored hither
and thither. The shrill cries of the faker
and the man with the hesta badge for sale
Tied with the fiesta whistle, while the
fiesta whistle waa itself fairly outdone by
a still later and more terrible toy in the
form of a miniature calliope. A* the sun j
cKmbed up toward the zenith the side- j
wa.ks along the line of march began to j
thicken with early and patient spectators, j
Bands of music strayed here and there
through the streets, with no more appar
ent motive than merely to march and live !
a rhythmic measure to the festival spirit
that pulsed in the air. Sometimes they
were foiiowed by detachments of soldiers i
or other fragments of a division.
It was the assembling of the great day
light parade. The rendezvous was the
vicinity of the tribune*, for the procession J
was to tile before the Queen first, and be- (
fere it had become travelworn and dusty,
M has been the custom heretofore. The '
tribunes ruled up rapidly as the hour lor
the start approached, anil when tue Queen j
was aunounced tnere was a vast concourse >
ready lo give her a royal welcome. As !
the buglers rode into the iuclosure and '.
cave their shrill warning the waiting;
throng leaned forward expectantly. The j
'â¢Queen's Own," the lancers with their j
kg. den spears, lÂ»d the way to ihe mnsic |
of the "Fiesia" march. The lancers I
cleare.i the way, and the royal procession
entered and moved, with that slow dig- ;
nity that belongs 10 royalty, down the j
long stre.ch of the arena toward the .
throne. Arrived tnere the Jancers lined i
up on the nor;h side of the approach.
Prime Minister Thomas took his place i
on the lower step, and, as the Qaten'scar- '
riage ed, lie orencd the door and let ;
her Majesty, followed by the rages carry
ing her lone train, up the golden step* to |
tup golden throne, under the shelter of a j
golden canopy. Every step of her way j
down the arena and until and after the j
Queen had taken her place on the throne, |
me assembled people cheered and ar
-1 iauded her Majesty. Tie ladies of the
court followed up the steps and took their
places about her, forming a very attract- I
ive picture. The Queen was arrayed in
flowing robes of royal purple, her dark
bail being set off beautifully with the gold
and jeweled crown. The ladies of the .
court were Pressed in white and delicate !
tints of pink and blue and green, and
stood in groups of four. The open enr
riaee* were completely buried in white,
warlnÂ« plumes, while the drivers were
dressed in gay colors corresponding with
tue colors worn by the occupants. The
indies wore widÂ»-brimmed hat*, with
trimmings of appropriate tints, and car
ried parasols of the same shades. The
royal party being ?:ationed, the signal was
given, the buglers cave their call ana
Grand Marshal Madison T. Owena gave j
tiie order to march.
For two hours thereafter the gieat
ampnitheater was a moving spectacle,
comprising the dash and plunge of horses.

military bands, the ruoible of fire engines
and the rhythmic swing of the military to
the beat of drums. It was a thoroughly
inspiring two hours from the salute of the
erand marshal and his aids to the last
â¢ wish of the Chinese dragon's tail of the
pageant.
It was shortly after 2 o'clock when the
grand marshal led the Jong line dp before
tne throne, and, wheeling about with his
aids, Lieutenant-Colonel Welch, Major
C. S. Meredith. Major J. D. Fredericks,
Lieutenant W. P. Jones, lifting up their
t words, saluted.
ins first division waÂ° made up of a bat
talion from the United States nary and
companies F. A, C and I, Seventh Regi

Pasadena. At the bead of the division
was Colonel John D. Berry, marshal, and
Lieutenant-Colonel W. J. Scbrieber,
Captain 11. D. Alfonso. Captain A. S.
C'iark, aids. They were dressed in full
uniform and rode spirited horses.
Immediately following were the marines,
in holiday uniform, their white aucK suits
and general equipment giving them an
exceedingly handsome appearance. The
navy continzent lined up as follows, with
Lieutenant A. F. Fecbteler, commanding,
Ens:;;!! P.. y. J)rÂ»ugiasF. adjutant;

terev. Lieutenant H. A. Field, Ensing F.
R. Hughes; fourth company, seamen from
ttie Monadnock, Lieutenant A. M.

Tne feature of the division was of course
the navy, with their perfect drill and con
tdent swing. They performed evolu-
tions all the way down the arena, and
before the throne lined up and saluted in
excellent form, being applauded vocifer
ously.
Almost equally impressive was the con
tingent of the National Guard following.
i They were: Battalion Seventn Regiment,
National Guards, Major D. R. Weller com
manding; Captain N. S. Bangham. acting
adjutant; A. M. Austin, first lieutenant

The second division advanced to the

way, followed by hi.Â« splendidly mounted

The Fremont Signal Corps came next,
their appearance reassuring, the people
with regard to the weather during the
week. , .
The srcDnd division held up the honor
of two foreign powersâ Francs and Italy.
The L*gion Francaise was commanded by
Captain Billaude, and numbered about
i sixty men. the tricolor floating in the
breezs along with the stars and tripes.
The Garibaldi Guards followed, their
salute to the Queen, being acknowledged
gracefully.
The High School Cadet* brought up the
rear of this division. The company, of
more than fifty boys in excellent military
i discipline, wore a natty uniform of pure
I white, which showed finely against the
: dark uniforms around them.
The third division was composed en
| tirely of horsemen. C. A. Sumner was
marshal, and his aids were: C. Apabia-a,
H. K. Crawford, Otto Zahn, N. W.
Queirole, F. Grant and C A. Sumner.
'lhe Riverside band was followed by over
eighty members of the Royal Foresters
excellently mounted and arrayed in span
new and bright uniforms.
A mounted troop of young men from
the Los Angeles Military Academy, to tne
number of "twenty-five, were next in line.
The boys wore gray coats and white pan
taloons', and sat in the saddle like
veterans. They gave abundant evidence
of having had liberal training in cavalry
tactics. A battalion of boys on Shetland
ponias brought up the rear of the third
division, and the end was quite as inter-,
esting as the head. The ponies and their
youthful riders presented a charming pic
ture. The boys were in uniform ana had
complete control of their animals. They
executed a very clever salute as they
passed the throne.
A very pretty feature of this division
was little Anna Kes^ler, mounted upon a
trick pony, and her still smaller sister
mounted on a still smaller Shetland pony.
The horses were driven tandem, the
smaller in front, with Miss Anna standing
upright upon her saddle. As the pair
stopped in front of the throne the smaller
child saluted gracefully from her seat.
Then they moved a few steps forward and
the older girl leaped to the ground and
made a low curtsey. Turning, the horse
dropped bis head, the child stepped upon
it, took hold of the mane, and the horse,
lifting its head, dropped the girl into her
saddle, to the wild plaudits of the people.
And now the caballnrosl They were in
the fourtu division, or, rather.* the big
end of it. But the caballeros were not the
caballeros of the past two years. The
humane society has interfered with the
caballero to an extent that renders him
comparatively tame. It appears that the
prancing ol h\s steed was the result of a
pull upon a bit that has been discovered
to be cruel and is therefore forbidden.
The canalleros were sixty strong. They
wore costumes that were distinctly Max -
can. The material was of green corduroy,
with yellow satin trimming, silver braid
and abundantly decorated with spangles.
The sombrero?, with tall crowns and,
broad rims, were in harmony as to style.
The aids wore black velvet with gold
trimmings. Saddles, bridles, spurs- and
other equipments we in keeping with
the styie â '. affected.' They - present ja
handsome and dashing appearance, if not
quite bo dashing as heretofore.
Characteristic Floats in the Fiesta
Parade.
The mission Indian*, with war paint
and oows and arrows, riding quite as reck
lessly as the tamed caballeros, followed
that company and matte a very propÂ»r
obeisance to the Qupen. JThe squaws came
alter in a market wagon.
Randtburg was represented by a stage
coach and a line of pack uorÂ«es and uon
keys. A band of country musicians on a
hay wagon brought np the rear of the di
vision. The division was in charge of J.
C. Clina as marshal, with A. C. Freeman,
TV. L. Vail and < . \V. Winston as aids.
Tiie fifth civision was made up of Ori
ental color and goreeousness. The Chi
nese outdid themselves thiÂ» time. Their
dragon was of magnificent proportions
and terrible aspect. It extended half the
length of the tribune*, and humped itself
and swayed from sida to side in a most
satisfying fashion. It was followed by a
smaller but much more lively and appar
ently vicious dragon, with rolling eyes
and lashing tail. The dragons were baited
and tormented by a band of young heath
ena in front, which they were made to ap
pear as very anxious to devour.
There were 250 Chinere in this division.
They wore costumes that were exceed
ingly brilliant in colors. Every garment
worn by the dignitaries was a marvel of
beauty. Some were elaborately embroid
ered in gold and silver. The banners and
flags -.rere mad* of eilk and ?atin and em
fcellisbed with gold embroidery. Some of
the banners were so large as to* require the
**rvicM of a dozen men to carry t hi- m.
There were many mounted men'in line!
and UHM, like thone on foot, were elabo
rately costumed. Three, occupying high
places in the councils of the six compa
nies, were made particularly conspicuous
by reason of their rich costumes. Man
darins of the Â«econd rank rode in car
riage* a.'ong with tne members of the Chi
nese Board of Trade and invited guests
from San Francisco. In the ranks were
men representing soldiers, carrying the

MAYOR PATTERSON OF POMONA.
PASADENA. Cau, April 21.â Charies P. Patterson has been elected Mayor of
Pomona by the largest vote ever given a member of the City Council. The issues in
the recent city campaign were high license for two saloons and prohibition of tbe
local liquor traffic The former won after the warmest and most interesting campaign
ever known in Pomona Valley. The bigh license party advocated that prohibition of
the sale of intoxicants in Pomona had been a failure in two years of prohibition rule in
lhat city. It proposed to license two saioons at $1000 each a year, and to have the
saloons run under the strictest police regulations, and under bonds of $6000 each to
observe the laws made for their regulation.
Mayor Patterson is a native of Wayne County, New York. He was formerly a
strong Conkling Republican in tbe Empire State, and is to-day as sturdy a Republi
can as may be found in all California. He bids fair to be a very popular ofticar in
Pomona.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 2Lâ The sec
ond day of La Fiesta closed with a grand
concert at Hazard's Pavilion, which, from
both a spectacular and musical stand
point, proved a veritable triumph. The
Pavilion itself, still gorgeously decorated
with the trappings of the masquerade
bail he a there the previous evening, was
in every respect a suitable setting for such
a function, especially when the latter was
to be graced by the presence of royalty.
The hall was crowded with an expectant
throng of people, one and all arrayed in
holiday dress. - Shortly after 8 o'clock the
heralds sounded a fanfare, her Majesty,
Queen Francises, preceded by her guard
of honor, escorted by Prime Minister
Thomas and accompanied by her pages
and maids of honor, entered the pavilion
and, amid the plaudits of her loyal sub
jects, liowJy ascended the center aisle and
took her seat under ' a splendid red and
yellow canopy which stood on the left
hand side of the platlorm. Her entry
was the signal lor the orchestra to play
the grand "Fiesta March," specially com
posed for this occasion by L F. Gntts
chalk, the musical director, and dedicated
to her Majesty.
The march concluded Prime Minister
Thomas advanced with dignity and an
nounced amid renewed applause that the
Queen, recognizing and appreciating the
motives which dictated and inquired this
inspiriting work, had b*en eracioaslr
pleased to bestow upon Mr. Gott?chalk
the rank of composer and musical director
to her royal self.' The fortunate recipient
of this happy distinction bowed his
acknowledgment! and the concert pro
ceeded. -
An excellent and varied programme
was splendidly rendered by a full orches
tra. There was also a large and well
trained chorus under ablÂ« principals.
The soloists and vocalists were encored
without exception, and received numer
ous bouquets in the coarse of the evening.

SALINAS. Cal , April 21. â Salinas
capitulated to the Grand Army of the Re
public to-day without the slightest re
sistance. So shells were thrown, but
some bouquets were tossed.
Formal possession of the city was taken
when the veteran guard, headed by
Captain Joseph KnowUon, marched from
the depot to the Abbott House to music
by the Third United States Artillery band
from Angel Island. An immense throng
of spectators admired the splendid corps
and cheered the uniformed veterans. The
city of Salinas is beautifully decorated in
honor of the thirtieth department en
campment of the Grand Array.
True patriotic style is displayed in the
adornment of the buildings on Main
street and other prominent buildings on
every band. The veterans are hospitably
greeted by the generous people of this
progressive city. The capacity of the
hotels. is already overtaxed, and many of
the comrades, as well as ladies of. the
Women's Relief Corps, have been es
corted to private residences. S*H
The delegates to the encampment as
sembled at the opera-bouse at 2 o'clock.
Girls from the public schools were tnere
with baskets ol dowers, and each veteran
was decorated as he entered the hall. As

Commander T. C. . Masteller'a : speech
calling the representatives to order was
brief. It was decided, while waiting for a
report from the committee on credentials,
to hear the annual address of toe com
mander and the reports of other depart
: ment ofliccrs. The commander mentioned
with pleasure that, acting . upon the sue
gestion of the California department, the
last National encampment made the read
ing of Lincoln's Gettysburg address a part
of the exercises of Memorial day. The
increased interest snown in California in
the observance of the day was remarked
in the address. -
In regard to the Sons of Veterans, the
address Â»ays: â  â¢ "
I am pleated to note that there is a rerlral
in interest and improvement in morale in
tills organization in ihu department, whÂ«rÂ« it
has so longr feebly struggled for existence. It
Is an order that deserves the sympathy and the
encouragement of every veteran, it is to take
up the work we are so soon to lay down, and
to manago the destinies of the country we
have saved as its inheritance. Ido not think
its members should ever become members of
our order, because our bond is one that can
not be shared with those whose ties with us
were not welded in the furnnce of war, but we
can be of material assistance to the organiza
tion and aid in its uoDuildlne, and it should
ba the duty of each oi us to do what we can
ioriu success.
The management of the Veterans' Home
at Yountvil.e was commended, and tba
efficiency of the board of directors
praised. Sevan hundred veterans are cared
fcr at the home.
The services of the committee appointed
to secure legislation came in for recogni
tion. The address commends the Jaws
pasted by the last Legislature.
On t!ie subject of civil service the com
mander spoke as follows:
Xo matter, unless it be the subject of pen
sion legislation, :s of more vital interest to
the members oi the Grand Army of the Re
publicâ in all ex-Union soldiers, sailors and
marine* :han is the at present all absorbing
one of "ciTii service reform.' 1 This encamp
ment should, in my ot.iuion, appeal by reso
lution to the Senator* and Represcntntives in
Congress from the States included within our
territorial limits for a redress of the wrongs
perpetraud unon the Union veteran under
the guise of reformation of the civil service,
and demand oi them the full measure of jus
tice, and the President snould be asked
to suspend or modify the rules until
Congress acts, If it be within his p.jvrer to do
so. Thousands of one-armed and otherwise
crippled veterans, perfectly competent, to per
form the duties ol tne positions they held, and
equally incompetent by reason of their infimi
ties to meet with Bucceas in competition with
the young aud physically sound who jostle
against them everywhere, have been trans
ferred to places where physical strength and
endurance were indispensable, In order togive
excuse for demanding their resignations, and
when resignation was not forthcoming, they
have been charged on the record with incom
petency and summarily dismissed to make
room for others whote only qualification was
a record of faithful work along strictly party
lines. Civil service ru.es now cover the posi
tions of watchmen, messengers, sweepers and
almost everything else on the list, aud many
armless, legiess and otherwise crippled
veterans are not able to pass a
civil service examination although well
adapted for positions of tnis nature. Under
the present system of examination boy* fresh
from the high schools, or college graduates,
get the plums; veterans are barred by age and
by the struggle for existence which began im
mediately upon their discharge from the .>-er
yice and winch prevented them from acquir
ing the technical knowledge necessary to
properly answer the mnny i: relevant and im
material questions submitted by the Civil Ser
vice Commission to bewilder them. It would,
in my judgment, be the proper thing for the
present Congress to so modify the civil service
rules as to permit tne appointment of honor
ably discharged soldiers, sailors and marines,
and their widows, witaout regard to party
affiliation, to any branch oi the civil service
not requiring technical skill or knowledge,
without a civil service examination, and 1 be
lieve proper agitation by the Grand Army will
secure such result.
Commander Masteller's reference to
civil service changes evoked prolonged ap
plause.
The report of the adjutant-general
shows tue number of comrades in good
standing to be 5405, a loss of 336 during the
year. The totai number of posts in good
standing is 113. a loss of two during the
jear.
An interesting report is that of J. J.
Lyun, mortuary registrar. It contains
this calculation:
Recent official calculations have been made
at Washington, based upon there huviug been
1.154.810 surviving Union veterans in 1895,
from which an estimate is made, based up-.n
morality tables, indicating that the number
of deaths will be about as noted during the
perfsd indicated :
18S5-1900 155,471
1901-1905 .. . 179 G42
19OG-1910 194'42U
1911-1915 liKi.JO-l
1916-192U 178, 000
1920-1930 79 040
1931-1938 30!757
1936-1941 ... 5,950
Leaving surviving 340 in 1940 and ah de
ceased in 1945. The Dm! ratings cun well be
questioned, as several Revolutionary War vet
erans lived over 100 years ana a number of
those engaeed in the war of 1312 are still sure
viving, so that it is quite probable that som
of the members ol the (irand Army will wit
ness the advent oi the last half of the twen
tieth century.

CONVICTS FIGHT
TO THE DEATH
Duel Between Prisoners
in the San Quentin
Penitentiary.
"The Rat" Kelly Attacks and
Fatally Stabs Frank
Wheeler.
Receives in Return a Cash on the
Throat Which Rasults In
His Death.
SAN QUEXTIN'. Cat,., April 2Lâ An
awful tragedy was enacted within the pre
cincts of the State's prison at an early
hour this morning. W. R. Kelly, a con
vict serving a fourteen years' sentence for
a burglary committed in Sacramento
County, stabbed a fellow-prisoner in the
abdomen with a dirk. The attacked con
vict, Frank Wneeler, a notorious charac
ter known as "Ohio Fatty," drew a razor,
and with one stroke slashed Kelly's neck
from ear to ear, severing the artery.
Kelly died to-night, and Wheeler cannot
recover.
The affray occurred at 6:30 o'clock.
The 1355 prisoners confined at San Quen
tin are released from their cells at 6
o'clock, and according to the rules of the
prison each man must empty his bucket
and clean his cell. The convicts marched
out as usual, and when they were in the
yard Kelly made the assault upon
Wheeler. He stabbed him with a weapon
which he had concealed about his person,
and Wheeler protected himself with a
razor which be bad. How the men came
into possession of these weapons the
prison authorities do not know. Both
worked in the jutemill, where they
handle knives, but neither weapon was
obtained mere.
Dr. Lawlor, the resident physician, when
seen this afternoon said tnat the row oc
curred just outside the hospital and with
out loss of time the men were carried in.
Ttien it was found that Kelly's injuries
would prove tatal. while there was hope
for Wheeler's recovery. When stretched
out on tables in the hospital Kelly said to
Wheeler:
"Say, didn't I come up to yoa like a
man? I didn't strike you in the back.
Wasn't it square? Say, to show that
tbere'- no baa feeling between us, give
me a 'ball' and let me die like a man."
Kelly was an opium fiend and referred
to opium when he -a.d he wanted a
"ball."
Frank Wheeler is one ff the most des
perate criminals in the country. He
gained considerable notoriety some years
ago by escaping from San Quentin. That
j was in 1888. He was located in lowa
1 in 1892 and wa> confined in the Joliei
| and Sing Sing prisons, but escaped from
j both. He captured fn Loa Angeles
I and is serving time for burglary. It was
Wheeler who last year stayed hidden
in the jutemill for sixty hours in an
effort to escape from the pri on.
W. R, Kelly was known as "The Rat' ;
and "Little Shanahan." He was con
victed of Durglary in tb" nrst degree. For
some time past he aud "W n-eier had been
foes. Last Sunday they commenced to
neb., but were separated by guards.
The dirk with which Kelly stabbed
Wheeler was of rude constiuction, with a
blade about rive inches in length. The
razor which Wheeler wielded was without
a handle.
Warden Hall said to-day tbat the men
had quarre.e i about opium an i it was prob
ably * dispute over the drug which led to
the assault. However, it is mown that
Kelly said the night oefore that he would
"do up" Wheeler in the morning, and he
took the first opportunity, for the prison
ers had not been out of their cells ten
minutes when the stabbing took place.
The prisoners In the yara did not create
any d'.s.urtance and the men were taken
to the bospital without excitement or
commotion.
Kelly admitted that he was the assault
ing party and that Wbeeler only protected
himself. He died this morning at 7:30,
thirteen hours after nis jugular was
severed. Dr. Law.'or made every effort to
save the prisoner's life and the artery was
tied above and below the cut. It is not
expected that Wheeler will survive the
terrible wound that fie received at the
hands o f Keilv.

When the men found that they were
known and had no chance to "turn a

and presumably went to Arbuckle and
committed the robbery there. The next
night they committed a robbery in Max

This evening Talbot learned that they
had returned and were laving plans to

UPON CATTLEMEN
Shoot From Ambush at
a Party Riding Near
Lochiel.
Second Battle Fought Within
a Week on the Border
of Sonora.
Arlzonlans Rep'y to the Fire and
Three Combatants Are
Wounded.
NOGALEB, Ar.iz.. April 21.â For the
second titr.e within a week Americans and
Mexicans have o:i taped in s. clash at arms
on the border. Following the news of
the battle at Locuiel between Mexican
soldiers and so-called desperadoes from
the Arizona ?ide of the line comes in
formation of a light between United States
Customs Inspector H W. Brady and
several American cattlemen on one side
and a half-dozen Mexicans ou the other.
It occurred at a point a few miles from
Lochiel on Saturday.
Tnere has been trouble for some time
between tne Mexican authorities of Santa
Cruz on the Mexican side and cattlemen
on the American side of the international
line. The immediate caiiÃe of the battle
on Saturday was the arrest two weeks ago
of Tony O 1 Donald and H- W. Brady by
Mexicans for rounding ud cattle on the
Mexican tide. Brady caught his euard
not looking for a moment and jumping on
the officer's horse outrode the squad to
the line, seven miles away. O'Donald is
stiil in jaiL
On Saturday Kichard Harrison and
three other cattlemen were riding along
the line with Inspector Brady when six
Mexicans opened fire on them from the
brush with Wincne^ters. The Ameri
cans immediately dismounted and re
turned the lire, but as the combatant?
were several hundred yarus apart no one
was killed. Two Mexicans received blight
wounds and one American was shot in
the leg, receiving only a ileso wound.
There is a difference of opinion as to
who is wrong. Tne Americans claim they
were after their own cattle, while the
Mexicans hold that the Americans were
taking Mexican cattle. The United
Elates Treasury Department will investi
ga;e the actijn taken by Inspector Brady.
It is now said that the battle in the Lo
chiel saloon was not participated in by
American desperadoes belonging to "Black
Jack's" band, as was reported by the
Alcalde of Santa Cruz, but that the Ameri
cans were cattlemen who were attached
by Mexican soldiers because of the trouble
over thÂ« seizure of cattle. One of the
Americans who was wounded was M. Esca
lante, a well-known Arizona stock-raiser.
Tne affair has caused much excitement on
this eide of the boundary, and cowboys
are openly threatening to cross over and
teach their dark-hued neighbors a lesson
they will not forget.
CHEATS CENT R A LI A JUSTICE.
Governor of Minnesota WJI Not Extradite
an Ex- Banker Under In
dictment
CHEHALIS, Wash.. April 21.â C. W,
Johnsone, who went to Minnesota over
three weeks ago with a requisition upon
the Governor of that State for Frank
Hense, the ex-banker of Centralia, in
dicted by a Lewis Couaty Grand Jury, re
turned without bis man this morning. |
ili3 failure was due to the absolute re
fusal of Governor CJough to surrender
Hense under any circumstances to thÂ» !
State of Washington. Hense once prom- )
ise>i to come and set the hour for leaving
St. Paul with Johnsone, but the Gov
ernor advised him not to go. At the
hearing be accorded to Johnsone and his
attorney Governor Clough said:
â¢'I will tell you before you proceed that
neither you nor the Governor of Wash
ington can pile affidavits high enough to
get thAt man. You will never get him as
long as I am Governor of Minnesota."
Johnsone arrived in S:. Paul on Friday,
April 1. He went to the Governor's office
to present his papers. The Governor '
made an appointment with him for the â 
following day. When he returned to keep
the appointment, the Governor refused to
?e9 him. He found Hense at the Gov
ernor's office* having b? n to all appear- ;
aijces no'.ineii by that official at his home
in Aitken, Minn. The Governor sent
word by his p lvate secretary that he pro
vosed to hear Hense first and would listen
to Johusone afterward.
A week ago Saturday Hense sent to
Johnsone asking for a meeting. He ap
peared at the hotel on the Jollowin : day
and said that he would make no further
objection to returning. He was willing to
go back to Lewis County ana stand trial. I
A YOUNG THRIP AND THE RESULT OF ITS WORK.
Recent accounts from the vineyards of Fresno County show that the pest known as the
P or vine-hopper Is making sad inroads upou the grape crop of that section, and there
r<- grave fears that the destructive insects will make their appearance in other parts of the
i. A. \V. Porter of San Francisco yesterday received word from Malngo, Fresno County,
ti'- pests are attacking the vineyards in all directions, and that ao far no remedy has
und to stop their progress. The leaves and canes cro sucked dry of their gap. The

Keenest interest by vineyardists all over the Slate.
This was agreed to an 1 the hour for leav
ing St. Pau; was set. Jobnsone's attorney,
however, advised him against taking
HÂ«*nse without a warrant.
Johnsone then told Honse he would
have him arrestt-il, as his attorney deemed
it bpst. iiense broke down whjen he was
arres-ted. He wept and declared he was
ruined. He talked of suicide. Later he
calmed down, and alter he had spent an
evening with Johnsone and a depu:y at
tlit* theater he ;-.ppeared to be recouciled.
Governor Ciouph's conduct is said to be
without known precedent.
WEDS A SANTA ROSA BELLE.
Williom Vernon Tukey of Idaho Leads
Emma Angela Shea to the
Altar.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., April 2Lâ The
City of Hoses lost one of its fairest buds at
noon to-day, when Miss Emma Angela
Shea became the bride of William Vernon
Tukey. The ceremony took place at the
residence of the bride's parents in this
city, and that spacious man -ion had been
transformed into a veritable floral palace.
Semi-tropica! plants, lilies, lilacs, smilax,
roÂ»ebuus> and ferns had been used with
exquisite taste, until ihe quests, accus
tomed as they were to living in a land of
flowers, were amazed at the sight.
Behind a bank of ferns the orchestra
played a wedding march as the bridal
party took its place under the lovers'
Knot, where Rev. Father J. M. Cassin, rec
tor of St. Rose's Church, pronounced the
lovers husband and (rife.
The bridal costume was of white satin,
trimmed in old Brussels lace, with bridal
veil of tulle. The maid of honor was
Miss Ada Shea, a sister of the bride, who
wore a gown of light blue silk, with a cov
ering of crepe de chine and lace trim
ming;. After a wedding breakfast the
bridal party left for San Francisco and the
north.
Mrs. Tnkey is the daughter of Con Shea,
the v.e.l-known Idaho cattleman, who
makes Santa Rosa his winter home, and
the groom is a large property-owner of
Idaho, who hails from Portland, Maine.
After a short visit to Idaho the young
couple will make an Eastern tour and re
turn to Sau t rancisc) to'reside.
JIELDI.LX FOIiOHRI CASE.
Expert on Handwriting Testifies Against
Aatidtrs.
FRESNO, Cal.. April 21.â Carl Eisen
schimmel was on the stand all day in the
trial oi Professor W. A. Sanders for the
for^erv of William Wootton's name to a
$1400 draft. Eisenschimmel is from San
Francisco and is an expert on handwrit
ing. He unhesitatingly pronounced the
J signature to the draft to be a forgery. The
; expert went into the details of his study
of the signature and his reasons for believ
!mcitto be a forgery. He laid particular
stress on the fact that Wootton always
wrote the letters of his name in pairs as
follows: 'â¢W-00-it-on." There were
plain disconnections between each couple.
In the signature to the dra the name was
written continuously, without any breaks.
Eisenschimmel also pronounced the
j signatures to the deeds by which Sanders
transferred the Wootton ranch to himself
to be forgeries. The expert proved a very
! strong witness for the prosecution. His
; examination will be resumed in the morn
ing. â

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 22, 1897.
MANY EVENTS
HOTLY CONTESTED
There Were a Number of
Striking Features at
the Tourney.
Watched by a Big Crowd of
Spectators for Two Hours
and a Half.
To-Day Will BÂ» the Final One and
Interesting Military Movements
Will Be Presented.
The interest in the military tournament
at the Presidio does not seem to abate
judging from the immense throng that,
despite the cold wind and almost blinding
dust, remained for two hours and a half
watching the many events that were pre
sented. The major portion were of a mili
tary character and proved very interest
in?.
To-day will be the final day of the tour
nament, and the programme contains
many performances that will be new to
the spectators and will no doubt be
watched with satisfaction.
There were seventeen events on yester
day's programme, the first of whicn was a
continuation of the wall-scaling of the
previous day. This was the final between
the winning teams. The rivalry between
the teams lor first place urged the men on
with .the result that better time was made
over the ten-foot wall than on the previous
day. D Company of Bcnicia won in 31 3-5
seconds. .Battery H, Angel Island, was
second. ...
The semi-final of the mounted wrestling
| occupied attention for some time. The
contestants were Balch and Souvlesky.
They wrestled for neariy a quarter of an
hour, neitner gaining a fall or an advan
tage. They retired from the field and the
result was not announced.
The 440-yard go-as-you please in heavy
| marching order race was next called, with
j seven entries. By heavy marching order
: is meant that' the soldier wears campaign
I dress, is equipped with rifle, bayonet,
, scabbard, woven cartridge-belt and 100
j rounds of ball cartridge and carries a knap
; sacK containing one blue shirt, one under-
I shirt, pair of drawers, iwo pairs of sock?,
one pair of shoes, and a Dlanket, with
half shelter tent, overcoat and cape rolled
j on the outside, a haversack' containing
â¢ knife, fork, spoon and meal can, a canteen
I tilled with water, and a tin cvp â the outfit
! weighing nearly sixty pounds.
Tl>ere were seven entries, but only two
j starters. P.ickett of the Presidio and
| Chalmers of Â£an Diego. Puckett started
with a limp and trailed after Chalmers j
until the homestretch was reached,
when he passed him and won in 1:12 2-5.
Then there was an 880-yard bicycle race,
the men in light marching order, with
arms and equipment, disposed of either
on the wheel or the rider. For this there
were four entries and the contestants |
iound it not as easy to pedal rs when at- j
tired in racing costume. Roberts of Fort j
| Mason and \ ann of the Presidio were the
: only starters. Roberts stopped on the
quarter stretch because the strap Holding
his. rifle broke and the rifle stopped his
j wheel. Vann won.
The final of the broadsword contest next
| occupied attention and was decided in
j favor of Davis, be winning four points to
| Webber's three. This waa not as good a
contest as on the previous days, neither
man seeming to care to be the aggressor.
There were three entries for a baronet
race. There were five bayonets stuck in
the ground ten yards apart. The runners !
started for the more distant point, brought
back a bayonet, placed it on a rifle at
scratch aud left it on the ground and then |
went for the next furthest, unnxine the !
first bayonet and then placing it on the
second, and soon until the last one was
brought in and allowed to remain on the
rifle, and the contestants then assumed the
position of the soldier, with rifle at order \
armÂ«. Puckett won in 1:14 1-5; O'Mani |
j of Benicia second, and Brunotte of San
j Diego third.
Another military event was the quip
ment race, in which there were but two
contestants. Bowling of Company C, Be- I
nicia, and Puckett of Company G, Pre- j
sidio. The contestants stood at scratch, j
equipped with rifle, blanket roll, ten I
rounds of ammunition and white gloves, i
They ran straight away, leaving rifle at 10 I
yards, gloves at 20. blanket roll at 30, am- i
munition at 40. belt at 50, leggings at 60,
hat at 70 and then turned at 80 yards and
while returning replaced all clothing and
| equipments so as to pass inspection at
; scratch. Bowling won in 2:00 2-5, Puckett
falling out.
There were five entries for vaulting and ]
hurdle with bareback horses, but only two '
starters. This was a contest not "to be
judged by speed, but *in style and execu
j lion. It was over a 200-yard course, with
| four brush hurdles three feet high, fifty !
I yards apart. The contestants dismounted I
I when jumping hurdle with the horses and '
mounted alter eacii hurdle, and after
jumping the last hurdle the hone was
vaulted and mounted from the off side. I
Fernandez was declared the winner. Fi
zer of Troop B, Presidio, was awarded sec
ond prize.
The gun detachment contest between
Light Batteries C and F, Presidio, was an j
exhibition showing rapidity of execution. I
Each detachment was composed of caisson '
corporal, gunner and seven cannoneers
wearing equipments and posted as pre
scribed by the drill regulations at piece
limbered without horses. At signal the
piece was unlimbercd, one blank cartridge
fired, the piece and carriage dismounted
the wheels and carriage being laid on the
around. Tne work of remounting fol
lowed, another shot was fired and the men
resumed the positions occupied before the
contest. This was a very exciting event
Battery F, Presidio, was the winner in
1 :37 3-5.
The next contest was scaling a fifteen
foot wall which whs similar to the one of
the day previous except that the men on
top were permitted to use gun slings to
haui their comrades up. The content was
between Battery E, Fort Mason, and Bat
tery H. Angel Island. Trie Angel Island
team won in 1:37 3-5.
Obstacle race No. 1 was another event
in which there were but two entriesâHen
drix of Company C. Benicia, and Enr
strom of Company E. Presidio. The ob
stacles were a rail fence twenty-five yards
from scratch, a picket fence six feet high
with lour-inch pickets pointed at the top
and two inches apart, at fifty yards dis
tant, and a solid five-foot fence at seventy
yard?,and after passing over these the men
went twenty-five yards beyond the lust
one and stood in the position ot the sol
dier at order arm?. Engstrom won in
31 2-5 seconds.
The dead body rescue race No. 1 had
but two contestantsâ Millner of Troop B
and Fitch of Troop X, from the Presidio
A manikin tilled with sand, made as
near as possible in the shape and size of a
j man, was on the line of each contestant's
run, fifty yards from scratch. At a signal
I the men mounted, drew their revolvers
rode to a flag 150 yards distant, firing five
shot* each at imaginary enemies, turned
the flag and rode to the manikins, where
| each dismounted, picked up bis 150-pouud
| dummy, placed it . across the saddle,
mounted behind, and returned, to scratch!
Millner won in 52 1-5 seconds. . Fitch was
unable to raise his manikin at first but
was finally ordered to do bo, and he did.
A team of two men from Company D,
Benicia, and one from Company G, Pre
sidio, gave an exhibition of shelter-tent
pitching. There were two men in each
tent, hats and blouses off. reclininc on
blankets spread on the ground. There
were light marching equipments on either
side of the tent. At the signal the men
struck tent, put on clothing, rolled blan
kets in shelter halves, put on equipments
and fell in at a line ten pece* to the front
in the position of the soldier at order
arms. The Benicia team won in 2 min
utes and 18 seconds, but the Presidio team
did better work aud looked better on in
spection.
The second heat in the relay race be
tween teams from batteries D, Angel
Island, E, Fort Mason, and F (light bat
tery). Presidio, was won by the Fort Ma
son team in 2 minutes and 9 seconds.
The events of the day closed with the
tue-of-war, which resulted in a victory
for Company G over Battery Eâ gaining
by two inches.

CHOYNSKI AND "FITZ"
I Parson Davies Forwards a
Sweeping Challenge 10 the
King of Pugilists.
The 0 ympic and National C Ã¼bs
Hi?* Arranged Frst-Class
Cards.
''Parson" Dayies, who is the manager
! and guardian to some extent of the noted
pugilisti â Joe Choynski, Jimmy Barry
and Bcb Armstrong â has sent on a sweep
ing challenge to Bob Fiizsimmons, the
j champion fighter of the earth. The fol
| lowing is a copy ot a letter which was for
warded yesterday by Mr. Davies in behalf
of Joe Choynski to Al Smith, a not d
sportingman and holder of heavy-weight
stakes. It speaks for itself:
San Francisco, April 20, 1897.
Mr. Al Smith, Oiltey House, JVew Yorkâ Dkar
Sin: Having read a number of articlt-s in the
daily paperÃ to the effect that Robert Fitzsim-
I nions," tne champion heavy-weifÂ»ht O f the
{ world, has reconsidered his decision of retir
| ing from the prize rine the article also
j stated that he would not box James Corbctt
again, but would contest with any other
worthy aspirant for championship honor*, I
therefore enclose you one thousand dollars
($1000) in support of the following challenge:
I will match Jue Choynski against Robert
Fitzsimmons lor five thousand dollars ($5000)
aside and the heavy-weight championship oi
i the world, the match to be under Queen^oury
I rules and to a finish beiora the club offering
the largest purse.
I shall be pleased to meet the champion or
his representative in New York City about
| May 8, and it be will notiiy you I will meet
| him at any time and place he mar name. I
I will then be prepared to sign articles and
[ make a further deposit.
Trusting this will receive an exrly reply I
am yours truly, chari.es E. Davies.
i The Baldwin Hotel, Baa Francisco, until
April i! 6.
It is tolerably safe to say that the cham
pion will not accept of Mr. Davies kind
offer just at present, as Fitzsimmons, in a
! letter to a friend in this City, stated
I positively that he would not light any
| person inside of one year, and even then
it was doubtful if be would consent to
enter the ring again. But in case Bob
should change bis mind, doubtless he will
consider most favorably the challenge he
is first to receive that is wortt:y of his at
tention. It can, therefore, be seen that
the astute "Parson" is losing no time in
entering one of his favorites for a try for
the championship.
The Olympic Club directors met last
evening and announced that their profes
sional boxing card for the evening of May
18 will read: Jeffries and Baker, twenty
rounds; Gans and Leonard, twenty rounds
at 133 pounds; Kiley and Sullivan,, ten
rounds.
The fighters must report at headquar
ters promptly at 7 :30 o'clock on the even
ing of the ligut or forfeit $100. This means
no delays, and an early start of the spec*
tators ior their respective homes.
Tne betting on the Barry and Anthony
fight, which wilt tase place on Friday
evening at Woodward's Pavilion, was very
lively last evening. Barry sola favorite at
$10 to $7. The Armstrong and Print match
puzzles the bettors, as the big fallows are
not very well known to the local frater
nity. The Barry and Anthony mill prom
ises to be one of the hardest contests that
has ever been witnessed on this coast.

NOTES OF THE THEATERS.
Succest of "Mary Pennington, Spla
tter"âThÂ« Pearl Ladd Recital at
the California Theater.
"Mary Pennington, Spinster," is chiefly
remarkable for the opportunities it gives
Miss Cayvan and her company of doing
clever character drawing.
Fashion is snowing i.self coy of min
strelsy at tbe Baldwin Theater, and is
giving most of its attention to Miss Geor
gea Cay van at tbe Columbia. In view of
tbe great success scored by tbe play, the
management has concluded to continue it
for the balance oi tbe week, instead of a
double bill, as was ybripinally intended.
Miss Cayvan, however, has received so
ms-iy requests to produce "The Little In
dividual that sbe has decided to add this
commedietta to the bill as an after piece,
beginning with Friday evening. For next
Monday the Colnmbia announces Ward
and Yokes, who wiJl present their satiri
cal farce, "A Run on the Banics."
Minstrelsy ia drawing topheavy houses
at tbe Baldwin, that is to say the biggest
crowd is in the gal'ory. and tbe orchestra
seats are tbe least crowded portion, of .tat
bouse. Th* performance is entertaining
and varied and wins the applause that a
gocl variety performance always does win
in these days of the popularity of vaude
ville.
"The Overland Route" is one of the best
things the Alcazar has produced for some
time. Its name is the most unsatisfac
tory part of it. seeing that the action passes
chietly on shipboard, but Tom Taylor was
writing of the days just after the Indian
mutiny, before the Isthmus of Suez was
cut, when the Red Sea route to India was
called "The Overland Route," somewhat
paradoxically it must be confesstd. The
fun of the old comedy has lost none of its
spirit and the Alcazar Company handles
it well.
Mamie Sheridan Wolford's romantic
melodrama, "The Brand of Cain," is prov
ing a welcome offering at the Grand. Miss
Wolford herself plays her part with nerve
and spirit, and the members of the stock
company second her admirably.
"The Lily of Killarney" Is in its last
nights at the Tivoli. On Monday "Shamus
O Brien will be produced with Dennis
O'bullivan in the title role.
Grand-opera singers are proving to the
\Jtaste of Orpneum audiences, Alberti being
an especial favorite. The acrobats and
the trick baboon and donkey are all ap
preciated by the usual large audiences.
Pearl Ladd, the clever child pianist and
reciter, will give the following programme
at her concert at the California Theater
on Saturday evening;
"Harmonious Blacksmith" (Handel); "Ber
ceuse" (Chooin); "Norwegian Bridal Proces
sion" (Griee); valse A flat major (Moszkowski);
"Rigoletto" (Lis-zt); bonato No. 5 lor violin
and piano (Beethoven), Nathan LandÂ«bereer
and Pearl Ladd; "Invitation to Dance"

A Clever Performance, Which Will
Help to Build the Bou
levard.
The children of Congregation Beth
Israel repeated their preity performance
of ''Rutb and Naomi" at the California
Theater last night, for the benefit of the
unemployed.
The friends and admirers of the clever
little people almost filled the lower part
of tne house, and there was a very good
showing upstairs. The exact net sum
realized is not yet known, as all the tickets
are not yet in, but it will probably 06 be
tween $200 and $250.
The performance, which was very
artistically managed, was under tne super
vision and direction of Mrs. L. H. Mor
genstern and Mrs. S. Myrson. Some of
the children who took part were verging
on beins: grown up, others were mere
babes; but they all did their roles very
cleverly, particularly the tiny dancers,
who tripped about with a grace and agil
ity wonderful for such infantine crea
tures.
All the ballets were charmingly ar
ranged and were executed with almost
professional skill by the airy, fairy little
dancers.' The bower dane, performed
with the aid of large garlands of flowers,
was especially graceful, nnd the harvest
dance was novel and picturesque.
The dancers were all trained by Miss
Minnie Dreyfuss and the ballets were
under her peisonal supervision.
The music to "Ruth and Naomi" was
arranged by Benno I. Barnett, the leader
of the orchestra which accompanied the
clever little sinerers. Alice Lewis was
quite dramatic and effective as Ruth and
Sadie Mendesohn made a dignified Naomi,
while Mabel Benjamin sang pleasingly as
Orpha.
T.'ie other characters who distinguished
themselves in speech and so Jg were Rose
F.iMa, who took the part of Boaz, Leo
Levy and Abe Myrson the reapers, Mamie
Levin, servant to Naomi, A bart Abra
bamson, a messenger, ana Sibyl Gold
stein, toe cnpid of the cast. The follow
ing young ladies looked charming, and
acted well as Jewish maidens: Ida Levy
Goldie Harris, Phoebe Wolff, Adele Mor
genstern, Lillie Fulda and Mabel Koch

The Gospel Wagon.
The gospel wagon of the Epworth League
was out again Monday evening. Dr. Case baited
the horses on Taylor street, near Market, and
from the side steps of the waeon nddressed a
large and attentive throng of listeners. The
audience was respectful and seemed to be im
pressed by the earnest remarks of the speak
ers. The ladles in the wagon sang to the
accompaniment of the portable oiwan. Miss
Burton aadressed the people assembled in the
street.

And Deficient Circulation Call for Mun-

- on the Market â It Enriches and Puri-
f ies the Blood, Promotes Appetite and
Gives Renewed Strength and Vitality. 1
Professor Munyon says: "The idea that
one must tase 'Spring Medicines' is a
great mistake. It is true that at this sea-'
son of the year many changes take place
in the human body that affect the blood,
liver, kidneys and nerves, but in healthy
people these cnanges occur without the
help of medicines. In fact, it is a sin
against nature to take drugs of any kind
into the body unless one is iIL The so-
called Spring Medicines for the blooa are
also bud because they pretend to cure all
diseases with one combination 01 medi-
cines. If your stomach 13 out of order it
is absurd to take rheumatism medicine:
if you have a cold, a kidney remedy not
only does you no good, bat may do harm;
if your liver is sluggish, a nerve cure is
useless.' In fact, there is only one way to
cure promptly and permanently, that is,
by treating each phase of disease with the
appropriate remedy. 'A separate cure for
each disease' is the grand and true prin-
ciple on which the Munyon system of
treatment has gained its marvelous suc-
cess.' ."..â ""
"If you have an April cold, the first,
thing is to cure the cold, as this is the
season when grip and colds have a dan-
gerous tendency to develop into lung dis-
eases and catarrh. The most obstinate
colds yield in a few hours to Munyon'a
Cold Cure. Pneumonia, catarrhal dis-
eases and throat troubles are always pre-
vented by this remedy. Where Colds are
complicated by a Cough, the Cold Cure
should be alternated with Munyon's Cough.
Cure.
"The debilitated condition which affects
many, people in the spring season is Na-
ture's warning that some organ is weak
and often precedes serious diseases. It is
a condition which needs carelul investi-
gation, and which calls for treatment, not
with spring medicines, but with the rem-
*dy that will remove the cause. If the
stomach is disordered, Munyon's Dys-
pepsia Cure will act as a stomach tonic
and bowel regulator, assisting digestion
and curing such symptoms as pain or
soreness in the stomach, indigestion or
distress after eating, fullness iv the stom-
ach, shortness of breath, poor appetite,
coated ton: sour or hitter raising from
the stomach, heartburn, wind on the
stomach, constipation, dizziness, faintneos
and lost energy.
"If the kidneys are affected, tholaneuid,
drauged-out feeling is accompanied by
pain in the back, dam circles around the
eyes, headaches, and deposits of red sand
or mucus in the urine. Munyon's Kidney
Cure is guaranteed to cure 95 per cent of
all forms of kidney disease.
"When the liver is disordered, the
whole system feels the presence in the
blood of the poisonous substances left by
the defective action of this organ. In fact,
the condition is one of general poisoning.
There is depression of the spirits, tired,
worn-out feeling all the time, bad taste in
the mouth, aching and soreness in the
right side, backache, and aches and pains
all over. Munyon's Liver Cure stimulates
the liver to healthy action and makes a
perfect cure by moving the cause.
"Impoverished, thin and impure blood
is the foundation from which many dis-
eases arise in the spring .months. The
poor quality of the blood results in a gen-
eral low state of health, loss of energy ana
vitality. The patient takes cold easily,
and the colds are obstinate, leaning to
catarrh, rheumatism and neuralgia. Mun-
yon's Blood Cure not only purifies the
blcod, but makes new blood, rich in nour-
ishment that invigorates the whole sys-
tem. - It aids the healthful action of all
the organs of the body, revitalizes all the
tissue-, promotes appetite, drives out skin
disease!", brings healthy color to the
cheeks, clears tne complexion and tones .
up the nerves, dispelling completely the
dragged-out, tired feeline.''
No matter wnat the disease there is a
Munyon specific with which yon can doc-
tor and cure yourself. Munyon's Improved
Homeopathic Remedies are sold by all
druggists, mostly at 25 cents a vial.-There
is no guess work, each remedy is plainly

I ment, and the cure is absolutely certain.

It is reported xhat Lord Burford, eldest

David Bennett Hill is reported to be

An Oklahoma .Populist is quoted as

reason for revising their opinion.

ENGLAND AND RUSSIA.
The relations of England and Russia to one another and to the war in the Levant
is tfie feature of the situation which is undoubtedly more generally interesting than
any other. A large part of this interest is due to the fact that no one clearly under
stands the policy of the two powers, ana it is doubtful if the Government of those
nations thennelyas have iully determined either what it ia or what they would
make it if they could.
In this condition of uncertainty the guesses at the problem are innumerable, and
are as varied as the various sympathies of the guessers. We are told by soiue that
Russia is supporting Turkey, while others venture the opinion that she is secretly
encouraging Greece. We are informed at one time that England refused to follow
the Russian lead and make direct war upon Greece to compel her to evacuate
Crete, and we are told again that as all her interests are on the side of the Turks
she is really playing a double game and has pretended to favor Greece only the
more effectively to support the Ottoman empire.
Amid all these contradictions it is difficult to obtain any information which is suf
ficiently reliable to furnish a basis for a conclusive opinion. The best information we
have on the subject is tliat which has come from Mr. Gladstone. While tho diplo
matists and statesmen in c ffi:e have spoken in a confusion of tongues and seem to
have sought rather to mislead than to Instruct the people, Gladstone has spoken in a
clear voice, and has been evidently sincere in all that he has said.
Assuming the truth of Mr. Gladstone's statements and the accuracy of his knowl
edge of the situation, Russia in this contest is on the a de of the Turk, and the English
Government, with the best will in the world to help the Greek, hesitates to do so for
fear of involving all Europe in a general war. To this hesitation on the part of Great
Britain, as much as to the Turkish sympathies of the Russian Czar, we may perhaps
attribute the outbreak of hostilities. The lack of resolution in London has weakened
the councils of the nations who would otherwise have supported Greece, and has
thus rendered them impotent to prevent the Turks from declaring war and precipi
tating tho conflict.
If itseerus strange that Russia should depart from her immemorial policy of
hostility to the Turks and come forth now as the champion of tha Ottoman empire,
it must be remembered that the conditions of Eastern polities have materially
changed since the days of the Crimean war. At tbat tinia Russia had reason 10
believe she could succeed the Turk in Constantinople. This hope has been
banished by the swift uprising of a national spirit among tne Servians and Bulga
rians. Russia can hardly hope to absorb those peoples in her empire, nor could she
expect to maintain a peaceable possession of Constantinople against their wilL
It is the infusion of this new factor into Hie Levantine problem which has thrown
the lone-settled policies of England and Russia into confusion. It is this which
renders it doubtful what will be the new relations of the two powers toward one
another and toward the Ottoman empire, and there seems to be no statesman in
Europe capable of seeing his way clearly toward a solution of the problem so long as
this new factor remains an uncertain power.
All that can be hoped for at the present time is soms sort of a compromise, and
no one can foresee what form the compromise will take. The situation is one on
which it is easy to speculate, but risky to hazard prediction. England and Russia
have to work out their relations toward one another on a basis widely different from
tbat which prevailed in a former generation, and the fortune which directs the events
of the present war will probably have more to do with the ultimate decision of both
powers than anything which their statesmen may desire or undertake to accomplish.
TABIFF-MAKING.
To the average citizen it seems (bat the
Senate ought to be able to arrange tbe
tariff in a much shorter time than it evi
dently intends to take. It ia not a new
issue to the Senators. Nearly all of the
leading men in that body have taken part
in discussing the Mills tariff, the McKin
ley tariff and the Wi son tariff. They have
been talking of tariffs and duties for more
than twelve years, and ly this time, it
seems, ought to have arrived at some con
clusion concerning tha decree of duties
which are necessary to provide a revenue
for the Government and an adequate pro
tection to American industry.
This view of the csse. however, does not
take into consideration that tariff-making
is by no means the comparatively easy
tasc of applying general principles to a I
particular condition of affairs. In tbe
making of every new tariff a thousand
conflicting interest- are excited. The men
who are charged with the duty of fixing
the rates are confronted on every side by
importunities to adopt rates which will be
of advantage to one or tha other of these
opposing interests. A multiplicity of de
tail is, therefore, involved in their work,
and it requires time and careful considera
tion on their part in order to accomplish
anything that will be fairly satisfactory
to private interests and at the same lime
beneticial to the public.
Senator Allison, who has had as much
experience as any member of the Senate
in the conduct of our tariff legislation,
and vrho is as well versed as any in the
best means of provi ling at once for reve
nue ana protection, is of the opinion that
it will take the Senate at least two
months longer to so amend the Dingley
bill as to make it acceptable to even a
bare majority of the Senators. He does
not even venture to declare that two
months' time wiil be sufficient, but while
asserting confidence in tbe ultimate pas
sage of the measure leaves it doubtful
when it will be done.
The difficulty of devising a tariff empha
szes the importance of taking this sub
ject out of politics as speedily as possible.
That of course can be accomplished only
by the adoption of a tariff which will be
so satisfactory to the people that there
will be no further agitation for a change.
The Senators are aware of this fact and
will undoubtedly act on ihe present bill
with tbe intention of making it permanent
if possible. For that reason if for none
other, :iomÂ§ ba-is of general agreement
will be sought for and adopted even if it
can be ootained only by compromise.
The country, as the Republican platform
say?, wants this question settled right and
tnen wants rest. The Republican leaders
seek to accomplish that which the plat
form calls for, and while the deliberations
may be long and the processes of making
the tariff may seem slow, it will be best
for tbe country in the end that sufficient
time should be taken to make a tariff
whicn will give the country in the future
that rest from changes of duties which is
needed by industry and commerce.
THE ALASKAN BOUNDABY.
Reports from Washia gton of yesterday
announce that tno alleged discovery of a
clause in the treaty with Great Britain for
establishing the Alaskan boundary which
would virtually surrender the American
claim has proved to be only a mare's nest.
The clause in question, which niakrs
Mount Bt. Eiias tbe starting point of the
boundary line, does not affect the issue of
the line down to Dixon entrance, which
is to determine the width of our strip of
coast land, but is to serve only for the
purpose of a starting point for the boun
dary which runs through the gold dis
tricts of Alaska.
Tfce boundary in the gold districts is
not a matter of international dispute. It
is fixed by treaty at the 14Lst meridian of
longitude. It has not been thoroa^nly
surveyed, however, and as a meridian is
not a visible line the settlers of the dis
trict do not know where it is. It is the
intention of the Government now to send
a survey to Alaska providing for the loca
tion and mmrlcing by permanent monu
ments of the boundary Hue north of
Mount St. Eiias so mat the gold miners
and other settlers will know where our
juiisdiction ends and that of Canada
beg.ns.
The boundary line which it in dispute is
fully 500 miles away from the gold fields.
It will require a eoÂ«;d deal of diplomacy to
settle that point to the satisfaction of both
nations, but as no important interests are
at present at stake in that nart of the
couutry, there is no particular need for
hurry in the work. The selection of
Mount St. Eiias as a starting point for the
boundary, so far from injuring us, is
said to be one t. at on the whole is favora

ble to this country. It is reported that
shouU the commissioners elect to start
the line from the summit of the moun
tain, the United States would gain an
area of thirteen square mi es in extent.
It is certainly lima the Government at
Washington should show more interest in
Alaskan affairs. The Territory may yet
prove to b far richer even than the most
sanguine exp-c\ Every exploration re
veals new natural resources of great ex
tent, and it is believed that, nothing in
needed except better communication and
better government to bring about a rapid
development of the wealth of the country.
The American settlers in Alaska have
asked for a Representative in Congress in
order that their interests may be more
fully guarded at the National capital, and
despite the smallness of the American
population of the Territory, the claim tor
such a Representative seems to be well
founded. The whole Pacific Coast ought
to act together in supporting this petition
of the Alaskans, for it cannot be doubled
that the advancement of that Territory
would materially benefit all the States on
this side of tbe continent.
COMPASS CORRECTION.
The March number of "Notice to Mar
iners" issued by the Unite l States Coast
and Geodetic Survey announces that "it
is proposed to ascertain the true and mag
netic tearing? of natural and permanent
ranges wherever possible in the barbors
and along the coasts of the UniteJ States
with a vi-rw to their use by mariners to
check the compensation of their cam
passes and also the table of residual devi
ations." It is further announced that "as
it is believed this work will be of great
benefit to all classes of seamen their co
operation is invited."
Last February throueh an interview
with Alfred McNevln The Call directed
attention to the importance of establish
ing the proposed transit marks on this
coast from Puget Sound to San Diego. It
was pointed out ttiat many, if not most, of
tbe shipwrecks on this coast are due to
variations of the compass by which sail
ing masters are misled. When the com
pass 1Â« out of order the ship is in danger
as soon as uue approaches the coast line,
and it is imperative to the safety of ship
ping that some means should be devised
by which shipmasters could determine the
accuracy of their compasses and the ex
tent of the variations by which they may
be affected.
It is to accomplish this that the pro
posed survey of the true and magnetic
bearings of permanent landmarks along
tbe coast is to be made. When these nave
been marked the s&ipmaster can adjust
his compass by them and thereafter di
rect bis course with certainty and safety.
The Chamber of Commerce In this City
has begun a movement to have a compass
swinging station established at this port.
This of course will further tke good work
and Lelp to rid our sailors of the dangers
resulting front defective compasses.
The Call is gratified by the prospect
of the accomplishment of this improve
ment in navigation, to the need of which
it called attention. The one duty of all
concerned ii now 10 hasten the establish
ment of the marks as rapidly as possible.
The notice issued by the Coast and Geo
detic Survey says: "It is desired that
jntriners will send to this office the loca
tion of any and all ranges with names
and description of objects which they
think will be suitable for the purpose.
These will be examined, and those se
lected will have their positions determined
as soon as opportunity offers." The mar
iners of the coast should promptly re
spond to this invitation. This danger jo
ourshipping should be removed as quickly
as human energy enn io it.
RUSSIA COLLEC.ING GOLD.
- Philadelphia Inquirer.
If any Minister in Europe can regard with
equanimity the gathering war clouds it is the
Russian Minister o( Finance. The policy of
the Czar's Government in regard to Its treas
ury has been the wonder of Europe for years.
For nearly a decade it has been drawing to
St. Petersburg the gold of the world, retaining
not only the immense annual production of
the empire, but nuking; periodical drafts
upon its banters in Berlin, Paris and London,
until now the Imperial Bank ot Russia holds
the largest atock of gold that is collected any
where in the worm. In the last few years the
hoarding process has been pushed with energy,
and In the last twelvemouth no less tnan
$73,000,000 god has been added to the al
ready immense stock. In the face of the stag-
Kcrlng total nt $564,000,000 held at St. Peter*,
burr the $150,000,000 owned by the United
States Government and the $200,000,000 held
by the Bank of England seem all. and the
$383,000,000 held by the Bank of France ap
pears merely respectable. '
. European economists have long speculated
as to the reasons that prompted the Russian
Government to accumulate such an immense
sum of go.d, winch has been suffered' to lie
absolutely idle in the vaults of the St. Peters.
burg Bank. It was clearly not to retire the
paper currency, for there is only $515,000,000
of paper money afloat, and this could have
been taken care of long ego bad it been de
termined to do so. Moreover, the premium
on gold has not fallen materially while mo
hoarding process whs suing on, as It surely
would have done had It been the intention
to pay it out in redeeming paper. But
one purpc&a can be discovered, and that is
to prepare tor war. No other country has
mode anything like such extensive prepara
tions. Germany laid abide $30,000,000 oi the
trench indemnity, which is locked up in the
fortres* of bpandau, but this sum would
merely suffice to pay the expenses of mobiliz
ing the troops. Russia has its expenses for a
year in hand in gold.
It is probably this circumstance which ac
counts in part for the Imperative tone that has
marked Russia's diplomacy in the pres.-nt
Grecian crisis. Prime Bismarck said several
years ago that the next great European con
flict would be begun in the bourse. Russia
knows she is prepared as no other country is
and can push matters nearer the breaking
point than any of her allies in the European
concert.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
There must have been sad memories for Carl
Goldmark in the hundredth performance* of
his opera, "The Queen of Sheba," which have
taken place almost simultaneously at Vienna
and Buda-Pesth. His librettist, S. 11. yon
Mos9nthal, and most of the artists wno cre
ated the various roles wnen the work was first
performed in 1875 at tho Imperial Opera of
Vienna are all dead, and the few survivors
among the original singers havo all retired
from the stage. Sd Goldmark is, so to speak,
the sole survivor, for the conductor and man
ager who helped to produce the work are
dead. At Dresden aTd several other large
German towns "The Queen of Sheba" is also
on the eve of Us hundredth performance.
Goldmark was first attracted toward the Â»Ã¼b
ject pf his most successful opera by seeing dis
played in a Viennese artstore Kaulbach's fÃ
motis piinting of the entrance of the Queen
of Sheoa into Jerusalem. "What a spieudid
subject for a romantic opera," he exclaimed,
and immediately sought the poet Mosenthal.
CARL GOLDMARK, Whose Opera Has Survived Its Interpreters.
The lntter developed the idea into
the present libretti), and then Uoldmark
set to wort. But the opera was finished
lon* before it was offered to the public. This
was the result of a peculiar complication.
The Vienna Municipal Council offered an au
nual stipend to encourage th â¢ efforts of young
composers. One year the stipend was awarded
to Goldm*rk. A jealous competitor subse
quently became director of the Vienna Court
Opera, and stubbornly refused to consider the
production of the opera. So the "Queen of
Sheba" was shelved with little hope of a pub
lic hearing. One evening, however, at a
soiree in the house of the Austrian Prime
Minister, two of Vienna's well-known musi
cians happened to play some parts of the
opera. The wife of the I'rince became inter
ested, instituted inquiries as to trie work and
its composer, and was finally instrumental In
bringing about its produc.iou, despite the
continued ill-will of the director of the onera
nousc. UoUlniHrk's la;est opera, '-The Cricket
on the Hearth," has yet to be heard in this
country. "Th*> Queen of Sheba" was produced
by Anton Seidl in 1887. Though entering In
his gixty-sevenlh year, Ooldmark Is still hale
and strong, and promises to go on composing
for many a year to come.
The mistakes committed by architects of
theaters are more than can be counted, but
the mistakes msde in the Imperial Theater of
Vienna, the famous Burgtheater, surpass im
agination. Alter having expendeJ a respect
able number of years, and a still Jiort' re
spectable number of millions, the architect,
Yon HaÂ«enauer, at last declared his work,
loaded with gilding and martfle, ready to be
inaugurated. The luxury of the building,
which, to say the truth, is rather loud, was
admired, but it was soon discovered that many
of the b.Â»xcs ware useless, because th 9 occu
pants could hear little arid see le?s. Even the
acoustics of the orchestra seats left much to
be desired. A; the end of a week complaints
were general from subscribers, who had taken
their boxes from the architect's plan. A Vien
nese critic, celebrated (or his independence
and frankness, adrised a reconstruction of the
building, to the great indignation of most of
his contemporaries. Fifteen years hr.ye passed,
and very disastrous years they have been to
the management, In spi:e of the imperial sub
sidy. At this late date it has been decided to
partially reconstruct the Bergtheater, with an
eye especially to Improving its acoustic prop
erties. The changes will be made during the
summer.
Morganatic marriages between authentic
princes and princesses <>i the theater have
reen numerous enough during the nineteenth
century, as the Almanach deGotha shows, but
It is a novelty to see the marriagj of the niece
of an Empress and a singer. This has just taken
place in Germany, however. A niece of the
Empress of Austria, the daughter of her
brother, Louis of Bavaria, who is divorced from
her first husband, Count yon Larisch, has juat
married Brucks, the barytone of the Munich
Opera-house. Brucks has had a checkered
enough career. He b3gan his professional
lite as a cornet-playtr in the orchestra of a
little German theater. By chance Neumann
discovered that he possessed a very line bary
tone voice and engaged him for tho opera
house at Prague, where he remained a popu
lar favorite for some yesrs. Afterward Brurks
went to the Theatre Royal at Munich, where
he also obtained an appointment as court
singer (Koen. Kammersaenser). Now that ;
Brucks has become the husband of a near rela
tive of the Prince Regent It is very unlikely
that he will remain at the Royal Opera-house.
A comic side sometimes presents itwlf in the
most serious affairs, as the following which
happened the other day shows: A .iirlit opera
troupe of French singers is giving per
formances in Constantinople and among
other works has presented the famiiUroperetta
"La Belle Helene." It is a Turkish custom
that the censor shall be present at the dress
rehearsel to stop anything objectionable in
the performance. At the last rehearsal of "La
Belle Helene" all went well till the moment
when the grand ensemble was attacked, ' 'Pars
pour la Crete! Pars pour la Crete! (Away 10
Crtte! Away to Crete !) These words produced
the effect of the ancient ' 'Mene, Mene, Thocel,
Upharsin" on the censor. At one bound he was
on the stage to put his veto on an expression
which, under existing conditions, seemed to
have a deep political significance. All was
soon arranged, however. Instead of the ob
noxious "Pars pour la Crete" the company
substituted '-Pars pour la Chine!" (Away to
China!), which had no meaning, but the Turk
ish empire was saved and the censor also.
The Council of Stale of Madrid has just ren
dered a very curious decision. Toe singer
Don Fernando Diaz do Mennozi, Count of
Lalaing, grandee of Spain, son of the Count of
fielazste, Marqu.s of Fontanar, brother of the
Couutess San Luis and brother-in-law of the
Duchess de la Tarre, applied to the Council
for authorization to put hia family name and
titles on the theatrical posters. The Council
of State has not only refused his request, but
has decreed once for all that titles of nobility
shall never appear in theatrical announce
ments. The Count Fernando de Diaz is 26
years of age and is the possessor of a very
beautiful voice.
The Sutro girls, two American pianists, are
meeting with wnrm appreciation in Paris. Le
Figaro says: "The concert o: UUea, Sutro,
which took place last Friday in the St.le Erard
was the occasion of a very warm and personal
success for the eminent pianistes." Speaking
of the performance of Raff's "Gavotte Musette"
the paper adds: "The Miles. Sutro executed
it with impeccable method, combined with
perfect art, and they received the enthusiastic
applause of the public."
Quite a history is attached to the auto
graphic fragment of aa opera by Richard
Wagner, dated March 1, 1833, and containing
thirty-gix pages in folio, which was dedicated
and given to the Musical Society of Wurz
bourg. The master must often have regretted
having made this present, for in 1879 he made
attempts to regain possession of the fragment,
and as its owners demanded an exaggerated
sum for it Wapner sued for its recovory. He
lost his case and had to pay the costs, which
amounted to $100. This relic, which has
never been published, has just been sold at
Wurzbourg to a Mrs. Burrell of London, who
paid a very high price for it Wagneriam are
hoping that the new owner will publish the
fragment.
There will soon be two new "Bohemias" in
the field in Italy. The "Bohemia" of Puccini
wil be given first at Rome and afterward at
tii- I.yric Theater in Milan, and the "Bohe
mia" composed by Leoncavallo wili mxke its
first appearance at the Venice Th ater, Venice,
during the coming exposition of tine arts.
Mme. Elise Frandln, tne i?reat Italian Carmen,
will create the role oi Musette in the latter
work and Mme. Storchio will be the Mirni.
Decidedly "Bohemia" is in vogue, for Masse-
I net's " Bohemia" has been popular In Italy for
several seasons.
It Is said that a ereat success has been
achieved at the Grand Ducal Theater of Olden
burg by an uripub.ish d opera, the words of
which were writien by Prince Emile Schanaich-
Carolath and the music by the Landgrave of
Hesse. The composer of tbe opera is blind, as
wus the late King of Hanover, and one can
imagine what immense industry the Land
grave has shown in writing the score of the
opera, which is called "Fatbine," for he
arranged it for orchestra himself.
A veritable epidem c seems to reign among
the chefs d'orchestra of the Grana Ducal
Theater of Weimar, for they all resign the
baton af.cr a month or two of service. Com
posers sucn as Kichaid Strauss, Eugene
d'Albertand Reznicet succeeded one another
rapidly last season, and the present con
ductor, Hcrr Wolfram, is preparing to qnit his
po?t. This state of things will not augment
the prestige of the theater, formerly rendered
co celebrated by Franz Liszt.
The latest recruit to the variety ranks is
Hayden Coffin, who was here some years ago
as Lillian Russell's lending man, and mr.de a
bigger hit than the prima donna. He is sing
ing at Daly's Theater In London at present,
but ho is to go to the Oxford Muilc Hall in a
few weeks.

Buena Vista Parlor or the Native I laugh
ters of the Golden West Give* an
Anniversary Ball.
Last Tuesday [ Buena , Vista Parlor, Native
Daughters of the Golden West, was five years
old, and it celebrated the event by a errand
ball in Native Sons' Hall. As this parlor is
noted for giving entertainments that are of
the highest order there is not one of its func
tions that has not In the past been attended
by its friends, that number legion, and the
hall is always filled to its capacity. On the I
evening of the wooden anniversary, the hall
which had been most tastelully decorated
with the colors of the order and a stage set
ting appropriate to the season, lilies and ever
greens, had every seat in the gallery occupied,
while on the floor there were us many couples
as could find room to iudulge in the fasci
nating mazes of the waltz and other dances.
The toilets of many or the ladies were most
exquisite, and added much to the brilliancy
of the scene as the throng moved in the glow
of the incandescent lights.
The grand march was led by Past President
Miss Anna Harm and President Miss Annie
Westhouse, and they were followed by more
than a hundred couples. The souvenirs of
the . occasion were the dance programmes
printed on thin oblong sheets of white cedar'
and tied with a small bow of Nile green baby
r bbon in such a manner that the leaves could
bo separate and formed in the shape of a lan
and U!>ed as such, it was a novel idea, and it
was useful as well as pretty.
The ladies of the parlor have reason to
feel proud of the function they gave, and
much of the credit of its success is due to the
arrangement committee, composed of Mss
EmmÂ» Braver, Miss B. O'Brien, Mrs. J.

J. Ai Mapapnos and Mrs. Sarah Beversen

Alter that Grand Secretary S. B. Carle
ton, who for ten yeais has tilled the office
to the utmost satisfaction of the entire

sented with an evidence of an apprecia
tion of his efforts in the shape of an ele
gant fob chain, with a seal, appropriately
engraved. The present was well bestowed,
for there are but few who are more pains
taking and energetic in the cause of the
order than Mr. Carleton.

CHRISTIANS
TO PICNIC
ON SUNDAY
Rev. Ford's Remarkable
Departure From Beaten
Paths.
THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH
UP TO DATE.
> â 
A Pastor Wfco Believes That
Sunday Was Made for Man,'*
Not Man lor Sunday.
FREELY SPEAKS HIS MIND OK
ORTHCDCXY.
Services Will Bo Held in Some
Pretty Spot ani a Basket Lunch
Will Be Held.
Rev. Dr. Frank S. Ford of the First
Christian Church is nothing if not origi
nal, lie propose^ to bold a Sunday pic
nic toon. "Not the regulation picnic,"
he says, "Tor we will hold our regular ser
vices, have a sermon and all the rest of it,
you know. Why shouldn't they be held
in the open air? Every one concerned
would enjoy them more, lam sure. I be
lieve Sunday was made for man, not man
for Sunday.
â¢â¢Of course we will have a lunch," he
continued, "and perhaps dinner, too. In
fact, it will be an old-fashiontd basket
party."
Mr. Ford does not expect a great deal of
opposition and adverse criticism on the
proposition; be reaily doesn't rare a
snap of his finger for all the criticism in
the world.
"My congregation stands by me, and
that is all I ask for," he says. "Other de
nominations Bay we are not orthodox,
but well, you'll see it won't be loug
before they will think our way. I believe
thai Cbris.iamty is for this life as well as
for the next. It makes life all the more
worth living, and I arer that if you live
this life well you can let the aext one take
care of itself. We are not good in this
life merely :or the fear of the punishment
thai awaits us in the next if we do wrong
here."
The exact time and place of the picnic
has not yet been dec ded upon, but it will
take place this spring some time, either at
Golden Gate Park or some pretty spot
across the bay.
Mr. r'oni's latest departure will cer
tainly bring down all sorter of unkind re
matkaon the proposition, but the pastor
init-noH to go ahead with his preparations
and not let the remarks bother him.
Mr. Ford will be rt-raerubered as the
gentleman who declared he wcud preach
in knickerboiKera some bright day, but as
yet he has not done so, although he ap
pears in f v I'l rest all the time. His Church
:s packed to the doors as a general rule,
| ani among his congregation he is most
popular, so that he expects his people will
agree w:tu him on the subject of bunday
picnics or "basket parties."
Hit new n an, however, will hardly
meet with the approval of the other pas
tors, for they for a long time have been
declaring that Sunday picnics are a species
ol Sabbath desecration, and as such,
shou dbe condemned by the church. Mr.
Ford intends to inject the Sunday service
into hiÂ« picnic anu this may relieve It
somewhat in denominational circ.33, al
though with some ministers this may
only add to his iniquity. Mr. Ford, how
ever, thinks it a good thing, and he boldly
Bays a- much, and goes 0:1 planning for
his Sunday picnics.

did come his way the Charmer made port in less thnn twenty-fours Lours. The above sketch is made from a description fur

lector of the Port John
P. Jackson.
In Regard to Positions on the
Front H? Says the Cry
Is v Not Yet."
The Alaska Packers' Association's
Thistle Blown Back by a S iff
Northwester.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's Gaelic went to tea yesterday j
with a heavy cargo, but few passengers, j
A number of Chinese went away in the
steerage, but very few of their country
men were down to see them off.
Among those on the Wharf was John P.
Jackson, the newly appointed Collector of
the Tort. He took note of everything that j
was done by the Custom-house officers,
and mere a one thing certain â ha will
not take effics without knowing the ins
and outs of the Custom-house system.
'â¢If I were you," taid Billy Thornley, !
one of the best known Custom-house
brokers in the City, "I would go to Col
lector Wise and get a few pointers from
him. He oat been through the mill and
be knows what awaits you."
Jackson looked at him for a moment
and then asked: "Have you been any- j
where on the block ouunded by Sansome, !
Washington, Battery and JacKson lately? '
"No."
"Well, I have, and every inch of that
block is occupied by a man who wants a
job on the water front or in the Custom
uouse.
"Now in connection with your sugires
tion, let me tell you a story. I came to
California in the old days and har. to make
my way across the Isthmus of Panama.
It was a dreary venture, and 1 will never
lorget the vultures that hovered around
day and night awaiting the first man that
drooped out during the pilgrimase. My
traveling companion stayed with me
almost to the end, but finally the swamp
fever got its work in on him and iie
dropped oy the wayside. Before he was
dead! the vultures perc ed on his body
and begun peeking at his liesh. Ho opened
his eyes, looked around and the last words
ue uttered were: 'Not yet! Not yell Not
yet.'"
The schooner Irmgard is almost ready
to leave for Honolulu. Part of her deck
load will be a nandsome gasoline launch
which is destined to make connections
with all the small ports on 'he island of
lluwa.i. She will carry news as to the
sugar crop from point to point, and whsn
an idle spell comes she will carry her own
ers on excursion trips.
'I he Humboldt Sieamship Company's j
Humboldt made a smart run from .Eureka I
on her last trip. She left the home port
at 11:91 A M. and reached Meiju-s wharf
at 3:48 a.m. Captain Bonmfield asterts
that the latter time is v "give and take"
of five minuies, and is confident that in a
fair and square race the Humboldt could
beat the Pomona. The whole discussion,
and there is considerable of it along the
front, has arisen over the fact that the
passage of the Pomona from Eureka to
San Francisco was given as sixteen hours,
while that of the Humboldi wus sched
uled as sixteen hours thirty minutes.
Any controversy over the matter, how
ever, is needles*, as both steamers are so
evenly matched that another race would
not show a victory of three minutes on
either side.
The Alaska Packers' Association Thistle
went to sea yesterday, but had to put
back on account ol the storm. She bucked I
the storm for a time, but being unable to I
make any progress turned tail and made
for port
The s earner Cos'a Rica goes to sea un
der the British flag. When she was laid
up she was called the "Xlcarsjjuan
stramer Costa Rica," but as there is now
no Consul for that country here owing to
t lie federation in Central America a new
flae had to be found for the vesse .
The steamer Belgic of the Occidental
and Oriental line will be at least a month
late in reaching this port. While entering
the port of Hongkong her thrust shait
broce and she had to goon the dry dock
for repairs. The next vessel to arrive here
from the Orient therefore will be the
Doric, due here about the latter part of
this month or the Ist of May.

GOVERNOR BUDD
HAS HIS SAY
He Brands Speculation in
the Durrant Case
as Idle.
Wiil Consider the Case When
It Is Formally Brought
Before Him
Attorney D uprey P; ofesses Ignorance
as to the Attitude of Prison
Directors.
"Idle and worthless speculation."
That is Governor Budd's sententious
comment upon t'no talK in regard to his
attitude in the Durrant case. He was
evidently not very well pleased at such
comment either. The statement was made
yesterday morning at the Palace Hotel^
and the Governor continued in the follow
ing strain :
"The story in reference to the commu
tation of Durrant's sentence has not been
seen by me, and I know nothing about
the statements it contains, as none of
them had been brought to my attention
previously.
"There is one thing I can tell 70a that
can be depended upon, and that is, any
surmise as to how 1 shall act in this n-,a:
--ter is useless labor. I have given the mat
trr absolutely no official consideration up
to this unit, and have not the lea-t inten
tion of doing so until it shall hare been
brought before me.
"When such time arrives I shall spare
no pains to investigate it from beginning
to end, and then will be the propÂ«r tun*
to discuss any views I may hold. Com
ment at this time udoq my attitude, or
what attitude 1 may assume in the future,
is manifestly absurd.
"Moreover, I shall have nothing more
to say in regard to this matter until it
has been presented to me formally and I
have given it due investigation."
Attorney Deuprey stated yesterday,
also, that be ha t no previous knowledge
as to the stand for commutation taken by
certain of th* Prison Directors until he
saw it in the newspaper?. He knew no. li
{ ing of n petition ior a commutation, and
I intended to keep at work on the Supreme
Court end of the case until be became con-
I vinced such a course was lioceless, and
then will ajioeal to ihe federal courts on
constitutional grounds.
Durrani's lamer was not at home again
last evening, but Mrs. Durrant said mat
she expected his arrival at any minute.
The nature of tne business that causes his
continued absence was no: divulged.
One of counsel for defense was present
in consultation w i h Mrs. Durrant a part
of the evening. He did not care to talk
much, but stated that one strong card yet
remains to be played in the itmoui caae.
He would not say what it was, but msinu
! ated that it would be in the nature of a
surprise.

UPHOLDING THE LAW.
Millionaire W. B. Bradbarr Convicted
of ICxpci-tm-HtiiiE in a Cable-
Car.
W. B. Bradbury, the niillionaire, was
convicted in Judge Low's court yesterday
of violating the ordinance prohibiting ex
pectorating in streetcirs, and the Judge
ordered him to pay a fine of |5, with the
alterna'ive of twenty-four hours in the
County Jail. At the request of Attorney
O'Brien, who represented the defendant,
the Judge decided not to record the sen
tence till to-day as the defendant intended
to appeal to the Superior Court so as to test
mo constitutionality of the ordinance.
H. J. Huth. the conductor ot the car in
which ttie defendant expectorated, testi
fied that when he remonstrated with the
defendant ana advised him of the ordi
nance he expressed his contempt for the
law and persisted in expectorating.
Mrs. P. C. Jenkins, 2102 Mason street,
I who was a passenger on the enr, corrob
orated the testimony of the conductor.
The defendant admitted expectorating
on the floor of the car. He was unaware
at the lime that such an ordinance wa- in
exisU-nca and denied the legality of his
arrest.
The Judge said that the ordinance had
I been pub'is ed in the newspapers by the
Chief of Police and it bad been given ail
the publicity possible. He had, therefore,
no other recourse but to find the defend
ant guilty.

These are the twelve men, good and
true, who have been chosen to pass upon
the validity of Mrs. Nettie Craven's deeds
to two of the most valuable pieces of
property claimed by the executors lor the
late Senator Fair as being a part- his
estate. These are the wise men who are
to determine what is conceded to be one
of the most important issues that have
arisen since the death of the multi
millionaire miner.
The jury was completed at yesterday
afternoon's session in Judge Slack's
court, and the proceeding was witnessed
by an immense throne drawn from the
public at lanre by the magnetic interest
that has been manifested ever since it
came to light that Senator Fair did not
leave all of his vast possessions to his im
mediate relatives.
The taking of evidence will begin this
morning, the initial effort being, of
course, that of the executors to snow that
Mrs. Craven's deeds to the property at the
corner of Sansome and Pine streets and
that at the corner of Mission and Twelfth
streets are not genuine. Expert testi
mony on handwriting will naturally
figure largely on both sides of the case.
The morning session yesterday was
shore It was rendered so by the counsel
for the plaintiffs, who asked for time to
study over the list of jurors preparatory
to applying their last peremptory chal
lenge. James W. Patterson Jr., who was
sworn in Tuesday afternoon just before
adjournment, was examined by the at
torneys on both sides as soon as court
convened yesterday, and his responses,
showed that he was thoroughly qualified
to act as a juror. He was not on familiar
terms with any of the lawyers, litigants or
witnesses in the case, and no ill feeling,
or, for that matter, no particular affection
either for tiny of them. He had not been
readme much about the case, and had had
no opportunity to form any opinions.
Mr. Patterson seemed to satisfy the at
torneys and was passed. -
The" box was now filled and,- if no per
emptory challenges' issued from either
side, the jury was complete. But the
challenge privilege was going to be exer
cised â that was soon made apparent. The !
difficulty was, though, that each side had
but one challenge left and both wanted to
proceed with extreme caution. It was
the plaintiffs' turn to show their hand.
The attorneys for that side conferred in
undertones and their faces wore serious
expressions. Finally Mr. I'ierson arose
and, addressing the court, asked that a
recess be taken until after the noon hour
in order that he and his assistants might
further confer and determine whether or
not it would be judicious to resort to an
other peremptory challenge.
Judge Slack assented and 1:30 o'clock
was fixed as the hour for resuming the
case.
There was a story afloat during this re
cess to the effect that suspicion had been
fastened upon one of the jurors, but the
counsel on both sides denied this emphat
ically.
When court reconvened for the after
noon session Mr. Pierson announced that
after a lengthy conference the attorneys
representing the various issues united on
the plaintiffs' side had decided to permit
the jury to stand as it wasâ that is, they
preferred to hold their last challenge. , â¢
Judge Slack then turned inquiringly to
the attorneys for the defense.
"We will excuss M. J. Harrigan," said
Mr. Foote, who readily understood what
was wanted of him.
This left another vacancy : in the box
and Alfred Bear's name came out of Clerk
Casey's miniature Ferris wheel. Mr. Bear
quickly demonstrated, however, that he
would not do lor the jury. Mr. Foote
extracted the information lrom the tales
man that he had read a eood deal about
the Fair case and had in consequence
formed a very strong opinion. He did
not believe he could cast aside that opin
ion and try the case impartially, so he was
challenged and excused.
Barrow Mish, a retired milliner, was
then called into the box and sworn. In
response to Mr. Pierson's questions Mr.
Mish said he had a saluting acquaintance
with a number of the lawyers engaged in
the case, but was not on intimate terms
with any of them. He did not know any
of the litigants and was not acquainted
with Senator Fair in his lifetime. - '
To Mr. Foote the talesman said he had
read considerable about the case, but had
formed do opinion. He was quite posi
tive about this. - -
"Have you any prejudice against either
side represented here, or any one encaged
in the trial of this case?' asKed Mr. Foote,
eyeing the talesman sharply.
â  "I nave not."
"Sure about that?"
"Quite sure."
Mr. Foote then asked Mr. Mish if he
was not a brother of David MiÂ»h, who was
killed by Dr. McDonald some â  years ago,
and the reply was in the affirmative. -
"Don't you remember, that I' defended
Dr. McDonald?" asked. the lawyer. . .
"No. I had forgotten it," was the an
swer. .
"You entertain rather virulent feelings
. toward Dr. McDonald, do you not?" -v
"Naturally. I do." . r
"Well, now,: Mr. Mish, would the fact
that I defended Dr. McDonald and secured
his acquital have a tendency to prejudice
you against the Bide 1 represent here in
this case'/" K^? ;
"It would not."
"You are sure?"
"Quite sure, sir.''
So Mr. Mish remained in the box.
A question here arose as to whether the
plaintiffs had the right to another per
emptory challenge. Mr. Foote and his
associate, Mr. Delmas, maintained that
the other side had surrendered its privi
lege when at the opening of the afternoon
session the arrangement was made that the
challenge was withheld.
Before the court was called npon for a
ruling on the point, however, Mr. Foote
generously withdrew Ins objections to the
challenge. He and Mr. Pierson then had
a little talk, and both agreed to excuse
Juror Harry Adler.
James Wigbtman, a lumber merchant,
was now piaced in the jury-box and ques
tioned as to his qualifications to succeed
Mr. Aciler. Mr. Wigbtman told Attorney
Pierson that he was acquainted with Mrs.
Craven, but ha I not spoken to her for fif
teen years. He was on intimate terms
wth none of the people connected with
ihe case, and in fact knew few of them.
To Mr. Foote the talesman said he had
read something about tbe case, but had
formed no fixed opinion as to the merits
of the respective issues involved. He was
prejudiced against nobody concerned in
tho case and thought he would make a
fair and impartial juror. In fact, he was
sure of it.
Mr. Pierson at this juncture asked if it
was still understood thai the plaintiffs
had the right to one more peremptory
challenge.
"I don't know about that," replied Mr.
Foote.
"Wall, never mind, then, we are content
with the jury as it is," saia Mr. Pierson.
â¢'Oh, we will offer no objection if you
want to exercise a challenge," remarked
Mr. Foote.
"No; we are satisfied with the jury."
There was a general stirring about the
courtroom now, for the jury had been
completed, and the court promptly ordered
that the taking of evidence be proceeded
with.
But this part of the programme was not
carried out. Mr. Pierson asked permis
sion to correct an allege! mistake in the
amended complaint atrainst Mrs. Craven,
and Mr. Delmas, while offering no. objec
tion to this, said his side would certainly
have to be given time in which to plead to
the corrected instrument.
In consequence an adjournment was
taken until this mommy.
ATTACHED THE COLONIAL
E. F. Joy Sues Mrs. Sarah B.
Johnson on a Promissory
Note.
Other D3bts Outstandingâ The Pro
prietor Claims to Be Perfectly
Solvent
Sheriff Whelan took possess'on of the
Colonial Hotel, corner of Pine and Jones
streets, on an attachment sued oat yester
day morning by Edwin F. Joy, who claims
that the proprietor, Mrs Sarah B. John
son, is indebted to him in the sum of
$562862.
Mrs. Johnson gave Joy the note some
time ago for the amount named and
though he made several attempts to col
lect it Mrs. Johnson was not ready to pay
and he began suit. The action was filed
by Joseph Kirk, attorney for the Board of
Trade, and Mrs. Johnson immediately
went to the board rooms to try to head
the attachment off and prevent others
being placed on the furniture by various
persons to whom ehe is indebted.
She ciaimed to be perfectly solvent and
said if she were given time she would be
able to settle all her debts in a manner
satisfactory to her creditors.
W.W.Montague & Co. are among tbe
heaviest crcd tors, and a representative of
the linn saw Mrs. Johnson and arranged
to Betile the account in an amicable
manner.
A garnishment was placed on Mrs.
Johnson's funds io the First National
Bank to secure the amount claimed by
Joy, but it is expected that this will be re
leased shortly.
The keeper of the Colonial attributes
her troubles to inability' to collect out
standing accounts that she ciaims will
more than offset her liabilities. She fears
other attachments by timiri creditors, but
says tnat it is only a question of a lew
days before she will be in a good financial
condition.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 22, 1897.
The Jurors for the Fair Trial Take the Oath.
TRAFFIC KING OF
SOUTH AFRICA
T. R. Price Arrives Here on
a Tour Which Is Mainly
for Pleasure.
His Story of the Corridor-Car and
the Reduction in Rates to
Passengers.
The Freight Rates Rather Higher Than
Hereâ Government Ownership
a Benefit.
T. â¢R. Price of Cape Town, chief traffic
manager of about 4000 miles of Govern
ment railroads in South Africa, is at the
Accidental. He is on a tour of the world,
mainly for pleasure, but is incidentally
looking into such improvements and
methods in railroading as may arouse his
interest. He has just come from Aus
tralia, where he has been for some little
time.
Mr. Price is no ordinary railroad man.
His position is a very important one. He
was for seventeen years connected with ,
the Great Western Railroad, one of the ;
leading lines of England, prior to coing to
South Africa, where he has been for eigh
teen years.
The Cape Railway, reaching from Cape
Town to Johannesburg and beyond, has
with its branches a length of 2500 miles.
The Portuguese Railway, running from
Delagoa Bay to the frontier, is but sixty
miles long. The Netherlands South Af
rica Railway, in the Transvaal, has 410
miles of line. The Natal Government
Railway, In Natal, â¢ has 400 miles. Be
sides these there is the British South Af
rican Company's railway from Fry burg to
Buluwayo, through Matabeleland. About
200 miles of this road is now built, and
work is progressing in extending it, at the
rate of about a mile and a half a day. It
will be about GOO miles long when com
pleted. Besides these there are a few
short railways, approximating in all
about 200 miles. Besides these there is a
road through the Orange Free State 350
miles long.
These . details were given by Mr. Price
and then he added : ".V*^
"The bonded debt of the Cape road is
about Â£14,000,000. The road cost about
Â£7000 or Â£8000 a mile. Traffic is pretty
heavy, and this year we wilt pay about 9
per cent interest on the bonded debt. The
gauge of the South African roads, I almost
forgot to say, is 3 feet 6 inches. They
were made this gauge at first and after
ward the gauge was continued to insure
unity in order that the cars might con
form. The distance lrom the Cape to
Bulawayo is 1500 miles.
"Our cars nre somewhat different from
either the English or American cars.
They are a sort of combination of the Pull
man and English. Each of the cars has
four .first-class, compartments and six
second-class, besides room for baggage.
They are called corridor-cars. Each has a
long hallway or corridor on one side run
ning the whole length, ho that passengers
may go from one car to another through
the train. As a whole the people there
like them better than either the English
or American cars.
â¢"Our rates per mile for fare are: Third
class, 1 penny; second class, 2 pennies;
first class, 3 pennies; return tickets, one I
and a half lares. These return tickets for j
very short distances are cood for four I
days, for sixty miles they are good for h I
week, 100 â¢ miles for two weeks, for
longer distance they are good for a month
and for some three months.
"We are Â»ow going to make substantial
reductions for first and second class fairs.
It has long been our custom to makÂ» sub
stantial reductions for school holidays
and for excursions on holidays, liks Whit
suntide, Christmas and soon. For these
we ( charge single fares for double jour
neys, and for lamilies for distances over
150 miles we charge three-fourths of a
fare. Our roads are the first of which I !
have ever heard to make reductions for
families. HS3R
"Freight charges are' somewhat higher
there than' here. ,
'â¢In regard to Government ownership,
my impression is that it is to the advan
tage of the - people. .1 ? was for eighteen â 
years with one of the leading private
roads of England, tho Great Western." Â«
Mr.. Price seems a very careful- and
thoroughly well-informed railroad man,
as his position indicates. He will visit
some of the Southern Pacific officials
while here. Mr. Price is accompanied by
his son, who will go up and look at the
Yo senate.
THE LAW NOT VIOLATED.
Mayor Pholan '(peak* of the Disad
vantages of Cemeteries Within
the City Limits.
Mayor Phelan wishes to correct an im
pression that has pone abroad that he has
criticized the cemetery associations re
garding violations of the burial ordi
nances. What ho did say was that the
Board of Health should consider the
question of burials within the City and
county with a view to giving voice to its
sentiments as to whether or not such
practices are to the sanitary advantage of
ibe City. Mayor Pbelan believes that
cemeteries within the City limits are a
bar to the progress of the municipality.
"They lie across the path of the City's
growth to the west," said the Mayor yes
terday, "ana retard its development. The
City can only grow south and west on ac
count of its peculiar topography, and fair
notice should be given to the cemetery
associations that the time will speedily
come when they, will have to move to
â¢nore remote quarters. I may recommend
an ordinance fixing a term after which
burials shall cea?e within the City limits,
so that no unfair advantage shall be taken
of the associations owning cemeteries.
The only question involved is the growth
and development of the City, and I must
refrain from discussing the sentimental
eide of the question."

THE EXCESSIVE EXPENDITURE OF VITAL FORCE OR
nerve power is one of the greatest dangers attending early
manhood. "To beat the record," "to bo at the top or nowhere"
are the catch phrases that are well nigh omnipotent among young
men who are active, eager and progressive ; while "to be a high
; roller" or "to be in the swim" are the stimuli of the young fellow
I who wastes his vitality in dissipation, early excesses and indis-
cretions. To attain these ends they draw upon their reserve
energy and bend all their force and strain their ability to the
utmost, and all this at a.time when nature should be storing in
them a reserve of vital force for the, future. , What is the re-
suit ? We have a great many men possessed of a highly sensi-
j tive, nervous terperament. Instead of a steady building up of
manly strength and vigor, there is a forced, unnatural develop-
ment that brings on a shattered constitution, weak nerves, weak
backs and a loss of manly power. Men grow old before their
prime. Man does not reach physical perfection before the age
of twenty-five years, and till that time he must not make an
overdraft on his nerve force, for nature will surely demand a
payment of the debt. No amount of regrets will ever make up
the deficiency, and when a man looks back at his past life he
realizes the extent of his folly and makes an effort to regain
what he has lost. Such a man needs the toning and invigorating
effects of a mild, gentle current of electricity to infuse new life
and energy into his weakened nerves and to build up and
strengthen his vital organs. He can find no remedy like

OF THE PRESS
S. M. Shortridga Fights for
This in the Marriott
Case.
Gloom Overshadows the Coterie
of Lawyers for the Prose
cution.
Slim Showing Made to Prove the
Accusation of L b 1 on Judge
Hebbard.
A pall of doom overspread the coterie
of law j-ers who are conducting the prose
cution of the charge of libel which Judge
J. C. B. Hebbani has preferred against
Editor Marriott of the News Letter. It was
evident that the gentlemen regretted their
extreme levity of the previous day and
had determined to make amends to the
proprieties by increased and superlative
severity.
Attorney Julius Kahn, the principal at
torney for the prosecution, who has as
sumed the burden which in the regular
course of affairs would fall on the District
Attorney, was particularly funereal, only
relieving the solemnity of the day with
occasional bursts of eloquence.
The usual questions were proposed to
talesmen for the purpose of testing their
qualifications to act as juror.-. It was
no;ea that all of them said they believed
in the liberty of the press, and thought
thai judges should submit to criticism the
same ay other people.
Judge Hehbard sat with the attorneys
for the prosecution as usual and pave
them the advantage of his counsel. He
also kept notes of the answer s ot tales
men.
' Deputy District Attorney Hinkle was \
again at his post at Judge Hebbard's
elbow, taking the place that rrom time to
, time has been occupied by District Attor
ney Barnes and Deputy District Attorney
BlacE. This multiplicity of lawyers for
the prosecution has been one of tne spec
tacular features of this case.
Willard Perkins received special atten
tion at the hands of the lawyers. Mr.
Kahn soon satisfied himself, and S. M.
ehortridge, representing Mr. Marriott,
after pursuing the usual line of inquiry
for awhile took a. new tack.
â¢ ~ "If a Judge is unfair do you think a
citizen has a right to say so?" asked Mr.
libortridge.
This threw Mr. Kahn into a paroxysm
of eloquence. He declared that the office
of Judge ought to he hedged about with
greater consideration than given to or.ii- #
nary ciuz-ns. He started on a spread-*
eagle fiigitt of verbiage that threatened to
mount into the domain cf a Fourth of
July oration.
But Jxi !go Daingertieid unfeelingly in
terrupted the gentleman's flight of ora
tory with a cold, 1-ga! suggestion that the
argument was taking a wide scope, and
Mr. Kahn's eagle was left Hopping in the
air.
Mr. Suortridee said he was willing to
submit to the judgment of the court and
the question was allowed:
Mr. Perkins thought a citizen ought to
- have right to criticise a Judge :Â»o long
as only the truth was told, and he was
"passed" by both sides of the contro
versy.
Frcm beginning to end Mr. Shortrid ge
showed that his battle in this case was for
the liberty of the press and mo right of
American free speech.
Talesmen Brennan and Sbeehan were
examined and excused.
At last the necessury. "twelve good men
and true" were selected and sworn to try
the case. Their names ore as follows:
Thomas G. Taylor, Adam Wagner, A. M.
Lawyer, K. Gambitz, D. Farquharsen, R.
K^yser. D. B. Collins, \Viliiani Deeney.
Willard Perkins, W. C. Kramer, Joseph
Simon, Henry Levy.
All parties concerned wore so well
pleased with the jury that they agreed to
have a recess until '1 o'ciock to take breath
for the coming conflict.
In the afternoon Mr. K-ihn made an
opening statement. He sail that the
State wou.d do no more than to prove the
charge that the article complain**! of had
been published. After that ttie defendant
would b - compelled to prove t!ie truth of
trie article and Â»lÂ«o that it was published
lor good motives.
Clerk Dunber was called on to read the
indictment, w.iich h- did in good style.
Mr. B Ortrtdpe asked that all witnesses
in the case be excluded from the court
room, including the prosecuting witness,
â¢ Judge J. C. B. Hebbard.
Mr. Hitikl- protested. He said that the
presence of Judge Hebbard was necessary
for carrying out the prosecution. He h..d
never before i card of anybody asking for
the exclusion of a complaining witness in
a case like this.
Quite likely that in the truth, admitted
Mr. Shortridge, as he did not know that
any one before had the temerity to asJc
that a Superior Court Judge be invited to
attend to his own buslines*, the business
for which he draws a salary, instead of
remaining in another courtroom where
there happens to be a trial going on In
which the people of California appear as
the party plaintiff. In addition to being
an intrusion the presence of Judge Ileb
oard here interrupts the orderly proceed
ings of another department of the court,
according to Mr. Shortridge's idea.
The coart refused to shut out .Judge
Hebbard and W. S. Dreypo.'cher was called
a-, the first witness for the prosecution.
H* testified that he knew Judt,e Hebbard
and Mr. Marriott. He identified a copy
of the News Letter conaining the article
complained of by Mr. Hebbard. He read
it for the first time on the 31Â«t of October,
189q. Against Mr. Miortriuge's objection
he testified that Judge Â£lebbar<: was at
that time a Judge of the Superior Court
and that Mr. Marriott was proprietor of
the News Letter.
On cross-examination Mr. Shortridge
drew out the lact that Mr. Dreypolcher
was an ardent supporter of Judge Heb
bard during the recent political campaign.
He handled considerable, money for Hie
Judgeâ about $250â placed a lot of ad
vertising for him. He admitted tnat he
did everything he could to advance Judge
Hdbbard's election.
"And so did several thousand other
citizens," interjected Mr. Hinkle.
To this Mr. Shortridge objected, saying
that he wanted to know whether there
was a desire of counsel on the other tide
to try to send the defendant to jail by the
beating of tom-toms. If Judge Hebbard
was chosen by so great a votÂ«j as the gen
tleman suggested, would not that go to
show that the article was not considered
in any li.rht other than that' ol ordinary
campaign literature?
Returning to the main question Mr.
S lor.ridge wanted to know if Mr. Dry
liolchcr had not been busying bimse:t
boot the present trial, attending all the
â¢e?sions of court, aiding Judge Hebbard
by his advice, and actively advancing his
interests.
"Yes, I have done my best for Jud c
Hebbard," said Mr.' Dreypolcher. "He is
my friend, and I have stood by htm." "
> Mr. Shortridzeâ And you are Mr. Marriott's
bitter enemy, are y< v not?
Mr. Dreypolcherâ Not at aIL I'm his friend.
I have been friendly with Mr. Marriott.
Mr. si.ortridgeâ ls that your idea of friend
â  lip, trying to send a man to j*ilT
Mr - " r Â«yp'>lcher (somewhat dazed)â Well, I'm
mendly to air. Marriott.
At this there was a general wave of mer
riment throughout the room, though Mr.
Dreypolcher looked glnm, nnd a gloomy
scowl overshadowed Mr. Kahn's wide
brow.
At the conclusion of Mr. Dreypolcher's
testimony Judge Hebbard threw up his
hand impatiently and despondently, and
Mr. Kahn, taking the cue at once, an
nounced that no other witness would be
offored on behalf of tne prosecution.
Everybody seemed surprised that to weak
a case should be presented to a jury. It
seemed a poor showing to make after so
mucu preparation.
Judge Daingerfield grantad a continu
ance until 10 o'clock this morning, when
the case lor the dn endant will be offered
THE LATEST COMBINE.
Several Police Court Attorneys Form a
Protective Association to Secure
All the Business.
Several Police Court attorneys have
formed a combination to secure all the
business, and those left out in the cold are
raising their voices in angry protest.
Business has been slack for some months
and the struggle to earn a few dollars
among the attorneys has been hard. Ihe
piums. fell to a few favored ones, and it
was to put an end to this favoritism that
the combination has been formed; and it
is working well.
As early as 6 o'clock in the morning one
of the combination takes his stand at the
door of ihe City Prison, ready to gam ad
mittance and examine the register for
likely cases. He remains on duty for two
hours, when he is relieved by another
member of the combine, and so it goes on
every day.
The fees obtained by the combine are
pooled and apportioned pro rata.
HE IS A MONTE CRISTO.
Mrs, A. G. Phillips Will Pursue
Her Liege Lord in
A!:ica.
The Strange Stery of h Divorce That
Failed and of a Wiffi Who Sa/s
She Will Win.
Strange complications are iiSely to arise
at an early date over Judge Seawell's de
cision that A. G. Phillips of South Africa
is the legal husband of Eva Phillips of
San Francisco.
Armed with the legal documents that
declare the union binding, Mrs. Phillips
will soon depart for Africa, where she wi.l
seek to force her husband to support her
and his children in a manner becoming
his rank and station. Since he is worth
several millions and, so his wife says, had
been thinking of marrying another
wom:in, the step will cause him consider
able inconvenience and notoriety.
Phillips was a poor man when he mar
red at West Jordan, Utah, in September,
1875, :<nd his fortune was small when he
deserted bia wife and three children in j
Octob-r, 1892. But since that time he has
become a verllable Monte Cristo in the
gold fields cf Sontn Africa, where, begin
ning an a mining engineer, he worked his
way up to the presidency of several laree
comnnr.ies, oneot which hus headquarters
at Ch'-cngo.
Mrs. Pnillips thought she was Jeeally
divorced from the African miner, having j
succeeded i:i an action in this City on the j
ground of desertion some .wars aeo; but
when she discovered how wealthy her
former liece lord was she employed At
torney T. 0. Mogan to see whether there
was any legal way by which he could be
made to support bia children.
In looking into the case Mr. Mogan dis
covered that the decree was never legally
entered, and Judge Seawell set it aside
leaving the parties still legallymarried. ,
The defendant'? attorneys last week
â¢ailed in a mot:ou to set aside the find
ings, and Mrs. Phillips is now recognized
as duly married to the successful African
miner. As a result Mrs. Phillips will go
to Africa in a few weel;s and begin an
action for maintenance under the British
laws.
THE COGGINS ACCUSED.
Carrie C. Saiikejr Charges That They
Have Swindled Krr of Her
I'roperty.
MiÂ«s Carrie C. Sankey has preferred
serious accusations against her former
guardian, Charles S. Coggins, and his
wife, Mary E. Coggins. She charges them
witn conspiracy and fraud, and alleges
that they have by deceit, fraud, trick and
artifice possessed themselves of the entire
fortune that she inherited from her foster
lather, the late Samuel Bankey. toad
In relating her woes, Miss San Key,
through her attorneys, McGowan &
Sauires, has tiled a voluminous complaint
which presents a full history of the no 1
probate controversy which finally gave
her possession of the Sankey estate. This
case occupied the attention of the Su
preme Courts of California, Pennsylvania
and Illinois simultaneously for several
years, and the costs of litigation cut
deeply into the resources of the estate.
When all was settled, however, the young
woman found herself miÂ»tress of an es
tate said to be worth $100,000.
To-day she is penniless, and Â»be charges
th.it Mr. and Mrs. Coggins have swindled
her out of her property. She says she wj>s
ignorant of law, . was sick and feeble
minded; that they took advantage of her
condition and got possession of all her
property, since which time they have
turned her out of doors, friendless and in
poverty. She asks the court to compel
Mr. and Mrs. Coggins to disgorge their
ill-gotten gains and that all her property
be restored to her. ".., ? . ;; ...

T. F. Killeen and J. Hilton of the Man

accusations made against the ciub by an
afternoon iiaper Monday to the eff"Â»ct
that the ciub had "buncoed the unem
ployed" out of several hundred dollar?,
being the funds raised at Woodward's
I'aviiion on Sa;uroay night.
Speaking of the matter Monday Mr.
K:lieen said :
"Wo have been grossly libeled by this
Accusation, for our cinb stand" ready to
make good its guarantee of $200. The
newspnp'r that made the charges did
not wait until our club could take
action in a businesi way, but it sent a re
porter to see some of our members a few
hours after the event, and then, because
the money was not turned over at once,
come to a false and hasty conclusion.
'â¢The funds will be turned over just as
agreed, at 6:30 to-morrow evening."

the choir of sixty boys, chanting in their
clear, young voices the "Bridal Chorus"
from "Lohengrin." Following the choir
came the maid of honor, Miss Lillian
Morris, s.ster of the bride. The bride en
tered leaning on the arm of her brother,
E. T. Morris. The groom, attended by his
hest man, Mr. Oliver, mot his bride at the
altar, where Rev. Dr. Emery spoke the
words that united them "for better, for
worse."
After the ceremony the choir once again
led the way, marching through the church,
past ihe vestibule and into the .-treat,
separating mid forming an aisle to the
bride's carriage. Aa the bride stepped
into the ourringe, each little chorus-boy
seized his boutonniere, and, flinging it at
the newly wedded wife, literally showered
her with flowers".

Union Barbers Trying tiÂ» Close the
Shops at 8 o'Ciork.
The Journeymen Barbers' Union has
renewed the 8 o'ciock cloiinc movement
on weekdays. Some time ago an attempt
was made to bring about a general practice
of closing the barber-shops at 8 o'clock on
weekday evenings, but it was not success
ful owing to the union having too many
iron? in the fire and trying to accomplish
too much nt once.
Whiie most of the better class shops put
up the blinds and loclc the uoors at the
hour stated, there are sUil not a f.-w
places where the barbers lather and scrape
until late at night, thereby causing the
operat.vea to lead a slave's life, with abso
lutely no recreation or rest.
Ine purpose of the union now is to de
vote its energies solely to the early-closing
movement, aud it has already met with
considerable encourag' merit.
At the meeting list evening a commit
tee, consisting of A. Lorentzon, I. Less,
W. J. Foster! G. H. Hurd and J. Bleily,
was appointed to agitate the movement
and to induce all the bosses possible to
fall into line. A general meeting in I hia
end will be held early in May at 102O'Far
rell street, San Francisco. It is hoped
that the movement will be fully realized
by August or September.

Dr. Gardner's discii>Â«ion was very in
teresting. He approved the new law
throwing safeguards about people accused
of insanity, and deprecated the fact that
many cases are sent to State institutions
without & proper narration of evidence in
the reports.
Dr. Woolsey of Oakland opened the dis
cussion with the statement that insanity
is increasing so rapidly that in a few
decades the insane will be so numerous
tliat the sane will have to build asylums
of refuge for safety. He. advocated sur
eicai treatment of the insane, to prevent
their increase.
A paper on the Adulteration of food
products was read by Frank Howard
Payne, M.D. It mainly referred to the
subject so far as td is State is concerned.
He dwelt at length upon the analyses
made by Professor Hilgard and his assist
ants at the University of California and
by Chemist Wenszell ' and Assistant
Chemist Gould for the Board of Health
of San Francisco. His earnest desire was
to have all medical man become interest
ed in and assist the authorities so far as
they were able to do so. .
It was shown by the report of the com
mittee' on statistics that about 100 new
doctors hayÂ« been graduated and located
in California during the past year, while
forty-nine have left the State.
By a unanimous voic Fresno was se
lected as the place of the next meeting,

the ensuing year: President, C. L. Bard
of Ventura; first resident, William
Watt Kerr; second vice-president, E.
H. Woolsey; secretary, William Fitch
Cheney; nssistants, C. C. Wads worth and
H. B. Ellis; treasurer, Thomas Ross;
board of examinersâ Drs Wadsworth, Car
penter, Barbat, Dodge, Kelly, Woodward,
Hopkins, Williamson, .Hodijliead and
Hail.
Tne night session was given up almost
entirely to Dr. Joseph 0. Hirschfelder.who
read a paper on the treatment of tubercu
losis with his oxytubtMCuline. ThÂ« paper
was exceedingly technical and was illus
trated with many examples of cultures,
animals and patients.
The paper was briefly discussed by Presi
dent Jordan of Stanford and by Professor
Joseph Le Conto of Berkeley.
Doctor Kilter and others pursued the
question -further, after which the session
adjonrned until to-day.

908 broad war, April 2L i
2. The consummation of the long
cberialit-d ideal of "The Greater Oak
land,'* by the consolidation of Oakland
'with Alameda, Berkeley, Fruit vale and
other outlying; and contiguous dis
tricts. Thig we hope to accomplish
i-fiir.- the taking of the next cennus
in 1 J'Hi, vrliich will then muko us the
second city in our great State.
The above paragraph, which is taken
from the heading "Future Undertakings"
in the annual report of the Board of Trade
issued to-day, will cau-e much discussion
in the cities and districts to which it has
reference.
For a long time the fact has been recog- ;
niied that the:e is fully twice the amount
of money spent in government i:i the
territory outlined than is ueces^arv. The
project of a city and county of Oakland,
*hich shall include Alameda, Berkeley,
Fruitvale and the contiguous outiyine
district? is a practical one, and cannot be
much longer deiayed, according to thÂ«
opinion;" of those who are making a study
of the question.
The argument is made that in this dis
trict at the present 'ime there is an expen
s.ve county government, an Oakland city
government, an Alameda town trovern
ruent, a Berkeley town government and
numerous sanitary and district school
boardi, all being operated a: an enormous
expense. If all the inhabitants of this
territory were included unler one eto
nomical and practical government it
â¢would form a greater Oakland of about i
120 0.0 people.
As all the towns and cities mentioned
are now so closely connected that it is
impossible to tell except by a map where
one ends and the other Legins, the con
solidation may be said to have been
already effected.
Whenever this question has been men
tioned before it has always brought forth
great opposition from Alameda and Berke
ley, and it is to be supposed tnat this will
not be easy to overcome. The vast machin
ery, however, that in embodied in the
Board of Trade and Merchants' Exchange
of this city, representing fully 1000 lead
ing merchants, has proved that it can
carry out almost any project regarding
improvement that it undertakes. At this
t.nie especially, merchants in all these
three towns are laboring under great diffi
culties on account of pety municipal
â jealousies, which are exbinited in the
many narrow-minded restrictive ordinan
ces now in force.
The first movo in this direction has
already been taken. The ordinance call
ing the election to decide the annexation
of all the territory between Oakland and
BerKeley was prune 1 for tne first time to
day and the election will be b9ld on
June 3.
Berkeley politicians have already raised
some opposition to this measur because
it will bring tne charter line of Oakland
rieht up to that of Berkeley. When the
matter, however, is sifted down to a com
mercial practical basis, it is said to be
merely the opposition of politicians, who
fatten on municipal politics and who see
their profession being taken from them
by a consolidation o! government.
During the past two years the police
courts of the cities have been kept busy
wi h trying aLeged violations of license
ordinanc s. and the merchants of Oak-
Imd now declare that the competition of
Ban Francisco which now exists is only
rendered possibl? because of the local re
strictions placed upon merchants on this
sde of the bay. With this species of
legislation removed by a consolidated city
and county government it is stated that
Oakland would krep her trade among her
own merchants, oe-ides absorbing tnat of
the towns in the interior of this county.

A reculiar obstacle has arisen in the
way of one of the marshals now taking
the census of school-children of this* city.
On calling at the house of Mr. and Mrs.
Wheeler, 725 Twenty-sixth street, he
found a little child for whom the lady of
the house dccl tied to Rive any name.
The marshal exhibited bis authority and
told ttie lady that it was necessary she
should make a faithful return to h mof
all he children in her bouse. He told her
of the necessity of knowing exactly how
many children there are in this city of
school age for the purnoseof getting a full
allowance from the State. The unhappy
mars al even wmt further and told Mrs.
"Wheeler he was not sure that there might
not be an unpleasant penalty to be visited
upon any one who obstructed an officer of
such importance as a school census mar
thai.
Mr.'.. Wheeler told the officer a peculiar
etory. ''Tne child," she said, "was
brought here a few months ago by its
mother's father. The reason it Is here is
bfcauÂ«e of the baseness and treachery and
cowardice of a youns? man who once made
a promise of marriage, but who disap
peared when he should have fulfilled it.
The child has never been named, out its â 
fiuner is the 19-year old sen of a captain
in the National Guard. He has no love
for it, and declared that sooner than carry
out his promise he would rather see the
little nameless in a foursdlirj: hospital.
"Its maintenance is provided by its
mother's father, and its own father will
do nothing fir ir, because if he be forced
to it would necessitate the revelation of
Hie g cret, and relying upon tin?', he
â¢"â¼cdes his responsibility. I do not know
v. ii a : to call the chid, ana I d.< not see
how anybody can force me to give it a
name. If 1 urn required to do so, I shall
ca )| it after its father." I;,'

S ccnJ P aci to Count Two Points,
and th? Bicycle Race to B? at
thÂ» Velodrome.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 21.-The diffi
culty between the University of Califor
nia ana Stanford regarding the counting
of points and the place for holding the
I bicycle race in the intercollegiate field
| day has been settled. The contest will
| take place next Saturday afternoon â the
' dale originally agreed upon.
The que^ious at issue were submitted
' by the Stanford men this afternoon to the
University of California faculty commit
tee on athletics, consisting of Professors
| Bacon, Ch.pp and Edwards, for decision.
They met and decided that the bicTcle
j race should be held at ihe Velodrome,
i and that second place should count for
I two point?.
In the dispatch received by Professor
I Bacon from Professor Angel, Professor
j Olapp was asked to act as Stafford's
i representative in the matter. This Pro
fessor Clapp decline I to do. Professor
Edwards being out of town, Professor
Bacon and Professor ClapD met in the
capacity of a board of arbitration, and
agreed that the only thin;; to do was to
compromise the difficulty.
Professor Ciapp, in speaking of the de
cision, said: "The position of the Uni
versity Club as regards tne bicycle race
seemed to be unassailable, while as re
gards the counting of points there seemed
'to be fair room for question. It was
| therefore decided that the University Clud
! should give way to Stanford in recogni
j tion of their courtesy in bubmitling the
I question to us for decision.
"The bicycle race will, therefore, take
1 place on the Velodrome at 1 o'clock Satur
! day afternoon, as proposed by Manager
Birnes, while second place in the various
events shall count two points as Stanford
desired."
In regard to his declining to act as Stan-
I ford's representative. Professor Clspp said
| that he felt as though there should be no
real representing of universities on either
side, but that the question should be set
tled as speedily as possible on a basis of
equity.
Bjth Professor Clapp and Professor
Bacon agreed exactly on all the points of
the decision.
Swallowed laudanum.
BERKELEY, Cal . April 21.â W. Kirk
j bam of Lorin stepped into Earlies' barber
j shop this afternoon with the apparent
j purpose of getting shaved. W ile in the
I chair he asked for a glasi oi water, and
! while the barber's back was turned poured
a quantity of laudanum into the eiuÂ«s and
drank it. He was attended by Dr. Oberg
of Lorin.
Last night Kirkham eot drunk and as
saulted his wife with a knife. Becoming
repentant he took the lauaanam.
Stanford Jubilant.
PALO ALTO, Cal., April 21. â There
was treat rejoicing on Stanford's cam pin
this evening when Dr. Angell received
the decision of the University of Califor
nia athletic committee in regard to the
inter - collegiate matter left to it for
final settlement. The telegram read as
follows:
Dr. Angell: Edwards away. Clapp and I
i argree bicycle race on velodrome track Satur
day at 1 o'clock. Scoring, 5 to I.
Thomas K. Bacon.
This allows Stanford the points at issue.
i The newÂ» spread like wildfire. Encina
; Hall was thronged with students congrat
ulating eacn other over the happy ending
of a disagreement which threatened to be
I serious. The Glee Club serenaded Dr.
I Jordan and made the campus ring with
I its songs. The students pronounce
their rivals good fellows, nnd excellent
j leeiine will characterize the fi id day,
i which promises to be the most exciting
! ever held on the coast. The students felt
I certain of impartial treatment w hen the
matter was left with the faculty of the
University of California. The result jus-
I tifies their expectations. Coach King was
especially happy over the ending of the
dispute.

day which shows very clearly that thÂ«

stepmother commenced, or at least was
exhibited, the very day of her arrival
from Lake Tuhoe, where she and the late

will contest which is fast becoming
famous. Being in poor health and 65
years ol age, he stated that he was unable
to come to Oakland and be present at the
trial which commences next Tuesday, and
a commission was issued for his deposi
tion to be taken at his home.
L. M. Morse is a brother-in-law of Mrs.
Â£. H. Pardee, his wile and the late doc
tor's wife being sisters. He has been
acquainted with the doctor for twenty
years and nas known the widow since she
was a litle girl. When living in Oakland
many years aÂ»o sue wa-< an intimate
acquaintance of the late Dr. Pardee and
frequently called at their house.
'1 remember the marriage very well,"
said Mr. Morse. "I called on them with
my son George immediately Dr. E. H.
and Mr*. Pardee returned from LiKe
Tanoe. We were in the dining-room when
Geor.e Pardee came in from t lie hall. As
â oon as he entered Mrs. Pardee saiil,
â How do you Jo, George,' ai the same
:ime she ex ended her band to him, mak
ing an offer to snake hand*, but lie re
pelled it. He refused to take her nand,
made a stiff nod and sat down at the table
without making any reply at all to her
welcom ."
It must have been a memorable dinner
according to the testimony of Mr. Morse.
Dr. E. H. Pardee sat at the south end of
the table, Mr-. Pardee at the frigid north.
Dr. G. C. Psrdee on the east, lacing Mr.
Morse and his son, who sat on the west
side. These facts Mr. Morse remembers
well, because the conversation at the din
ner table was so limited that ti ere was
very little to think about except the po
sitions the vaiious people occupied.
"George did not sueak," says Mr. Morse,
"but looked at his plate and contented
himseli wii being silent. He was stay
ing at the home part of the time, but not
regularly, and on the occasion ot our visit
the doctor and his wife had just got back
from their tour to Lake Tahoe. lam cer
tain it was the first time that George and
his stepmother had met after the mar
riage. 1 know it of my own information,
but am not sure whether I was told so by
George or Mrs. Pardee, but 1 know it was
one of them.
"My wife and Mrs. Pardee are sisters,
but I have no interest in this contest.
These facts which I have related uil oc
curred at the late doctor's house in 1879."
The trial of the case will commence
next Tuesday morning in Judge Ogden's
courtroom, and it is expected that it will
occupy not less than a month.

Salvab'e Easily Downed in the
Handicap b/ Doable
Quick.
G org? Millar LÂ»d the 2 to 5 Chance
Caesarian Oa'â Flashlight Unp ac:d
In the Hurdle Ev.nt.
The usual large attendance of ladies
were present at Ingleside yetterday to
take advantage of the free gate, and as
one after another of the six favorites were
slaughtered, many of them experienced
quite a profitable day. as the fair sex sel
dom play short-priced horses. The weather
was cermet for racing purposes, and the
finishes close and exciting
K.smore, a 10 to 1 shot, led all the way
in the four-furlong scramble for two-year
olds, and won cleverly, a length in front
of Key Salazar, the second choice. Flash
inetoii was third.
The sulking Redskin was made a warm
13 to 20 favorite for the mile and a fur
long selling affair, and, after running part
of the distance under restraint, tell back
and was unplaced. Grady, the 5 1 . to 1
second choice, took the lead after paislng
the stand, and, never afterward headed,
won by less than a length from Peter the
Second. Earl Cochran, alsto 1 shot, was
a close third.
Salvable, with 118 pounds up, was con
sidered a certainty for the seven-furlong
handicap, and was heavily backed at
evens. Willie Martin, who had the mount,
?aw in the stretch that the chase after the
7 to 1 outsider, Double Quick, was a fruit
less one, and contented nimself with tak
ing the place, less than a length before
Nebuchadnezzar. The winner was piloted
by Clawson mid packed 109 pounds.
There was another big upset in the
mile and a furlong handicap hurdle
event, with ten jumpers facing the issue.
i Flashlight, (\itli 163 pounds in the saddle,
went to the post an 11 to 10 choice, but
appeared to poor advantage, evidently
being unable to negotiate the weight.
Andy Blalceley's horse Snowdown, a 3 to
1 chance in thÂ«Â« bettinp, made all the run
ning and won comparatively easy from
Huntsman. Tuxedo was a close third,
witli the favorite ending up in fourth po
sition.
The eleven starters in the firth event
over a mile were a cheap lot, and the air
was rife with good thing*. La Mascota
was a timid sort of 3 to 1 favorite, find
after running well for six furlongs died
j away. Encino, r.n 8 to 1 shot, led from
i start to finish, leadin* Tom Elmore, a 12
to 1 outsider, past the wire by live length;.
Tenacity was third.
Csesarian, the 2 to 5 favorite in the final
rive-furlone dash, also went astray. Badly
bumped three furlongs from the wire, he
lost three or more lengths thereby, and
Ht the end was beaten out a neck by George
Miller,against which 6 and 7 to 1 was laid.

Good sturt. Won driving.
Winner, W. L, Stnnfiel'i's h. c., by Loftin-Emma. Time, 1 -.0314.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 21.â The faculty at tha State University will donbtlm
hnve several other things to think about during the next few days besides giving
examinations and visiting high schools. Ninety-eight's "Blue and Gold" appeared
to-ilay and is reclete with jibes, joshes, digs and doggerel on the faculty mombers.
Caricatures on the most grave and dignified of the college preceptors abound. Under
the heading, "Swift Members of the Faculty." appears a story on the bicycling "profs"
with miniature cuts of President Keliogg, Professors Bradley. Rising, Clapp ana
Gayley on wheels. President Kellogg is represented as coa-ting down a steep de
clivity, on his way to market, bareheaded and with a market-basket under his arm.
In the story on the faculty "bikers" it says of Professor Gayley that he is completely
carried away by the bicycle, to the utter neglect of home duties. '-This explains why
the professor has ceased to perambulate the baby-carriage of late." In telling of Pro
fessor Bradley's exploits the Blue and Gold "josher" cites an instance when recently
the rhetorician was held up by the Town Marshal for coasting on the sidewaik.
Profes-or Some comes in for the subject of a little college fuu and Professor
Thomas R. Bacon ana Governor Budd are caricatured as attending the annnal
intercollegiate football game together. Though the hits on members of the
faculty and students are not so bold and raw as those of '96'a annual, yet they are
even more stinging, becnuse hidden beneath a multitude of cleverly arranged words
and sentences. The book as a whole is recognized as being as clever a production of
the Kind as has ever gone out from the university.
The editors and managers are as follows: Editor-in-chief, G. J. Rector; assistant
editors â A. H. Allen, Miss Centennia Barto, Allen L. Chickering, James Hopper,
Mary McCleave, C. K. OÂ»borne, Emily 0. Rusenstirn, L. W. Scammon; artistsâ E. W.
btadtmul er, E. L. G. Steeie, If. R. Thayer; buÂ«iness manager, Laslie C. Mott; assist
ant managersâ Harry A. Budd, Alex E. G aham, Clarence M. Dickerson, Josep.i W.
Leggett, Leon Roos and Miss Veronica Durlicy.
HE SWAM LIKE A FISH.
H F. Brewer L w red a Word's
Record at the Lurline
Baths.
The Natator Coveie 440 Yards in the
Time of 6 Minutes aa i 24 1-2
S n co d .
A world's record in swimmint: wns
made last evening at the Lurline Baths.
H. T. Brewer, the Lnrline's crack short
ana mi tile distance swimmer, swnm 410
yard& in tiie official time of 6 mm. 24>Â£ sec,
which was the slowest t.me of three
watches held by the mo9t accurate timers
of the Pacific Amaieur Athletic Associa
tion.
Cavill, the Australian champion swim
mer, is said to have held the record op to
iast evening. His time is stated 10 have
been 6 mm. 26 sec. The tank in which
Brewer accomplished such a remarkable
performance is W;Â£ feet in width, and aa a
consequence tlie swimmer bad to make
qiiite a number ol laps before he com
pleted the distance. He received a g:eat
ovation when tbe> announcement that be
bad broken a world's record was made.
T he rirst event on the programme wns a
half mile race, in which Geddes, Cornell
and Schii!te participated. The contes
was won by Cornell in 14 mm. 18 sec,
Geddes second in 14 rain. 36 1-5 sec.
The second svent was a 220-yard dash,
which was won by Hawthorne in 3 mm.
15 3-5 sec, Cornell second in 3 mm. 28 1-5
s c. The last of the swimming events was
a 44Q-vard race, in wb eh Brewer and Cor
nell were the only contestants, and the
race was won handily by Brewer in the
time- already atatcl.
Fancy diving by Cornell. Pomin, Geddei
ami Hartman was a very interesting
affair, but the exhibitions of high diving
by Professor A. Coblyn were features of
the evening's natatorial sport which re
ceived well-merited applause. His so
called fire leap from one of the high
perches was very exciting.
After the tournament challenges were
in order. Clyde Hawthorn of Santa Cruz
is very anxious to swim Renear 100 yards
lat three different places. He names the
I Lnrliue baths, Sutro baths and Santa
.Cruz as the places at which the contests
are to be held, and the winner of two out
of three events to be declared champion
short-dis ar.ee swimmer of the coast.
Â£. P. Stalls chal.engf-s any of the win
ners of the tournament to swim hm any
distance they may name, from 220 yards
un to one milr, Hawthorn, Brewer and
Cornell preferred.
The centtemeu who officiated at the
tournament werÂ« banqueted last evening
by the managers of the Lurline baths.

SPRECKELS
ANDSEARLES
IN A DEAL
Part of the Watsonville
Factory Sold to the
Trust.
TO ENCOURAGE SUGAR
BEET GROWING.
Additional Big Establishments
to Be Erected in the
State.
ABROGATION OF THE HAWAIIAN
TREATY FAVORED.
The Reciprocal Features of the Con
vention Are Sail to Have
Disappeared.
As the result of a deal effected between
Claus Spreckels and John E. Searles,
secretary of the American Sugar Refineries
Company, during the latter's recent visit
to this City, the next year or two will see
a remarkable development in the baet
sugar industry in this State, an influx of
Eastern capital ana a reduction in the
price of sugar on the Pacific Coast and in
all that part of the United States west of
the Rocky Mountains.
During the sojourn of Mr. Spreckels in
tho Last on his way to Europe to study the
beet-sugar industry in Germany and other
countries of the Continent, he was ap
proached by the leading men connected
with the great sugar trust with a proposi
tion to pool issues with that organization
and personally a<-unie charge of the beet
sugar branch of the business in the United
States, The trust offered to invest $10,
--000,000 in the enterprise. Mr. Spreckels,
however, declined the proposition.
But the Eastern people were not dis
couraged. They saw in Mr. Spreckels'
energy and enterprise in encouraging the
raising of sugar beets in California and
the establishment of beet-sugar factories
in various parts of the State a much more
Benous menace to their interests than the
importation of free sugar from Hawaii.
Determined to do the best they could
under the circumstances, they sent Mr.
Searles, one of the shrewdest men con
nected with the tru.-t, to this City to open
negotiations with Mr. Spreckels. Mr.
Searles arrived Here the latter part of
March, remained in this City about four
days, and then made an inspection of the
Spreckels beet-sugar lactory, located at
Wateonville, and al=o paid a visit to the
site of the new sugar factory that Mr.
Spreckels is building in the Salinas Val
ley, near the town of Salinas, which will
De" the largest establishment of its Kind in
the world when in full opeiauon.
Meanwhile he had opened negotiations
witti Mr. Spreckels lor securing an interest
in th WftUOnYille iactory and was suc
cessful to the extent ot purchasing about
a one-linn interest.
Claus Spreckels, when interviewed yes
terday concerning the transaction, con
firmed the iucts relative to the deal as out
lined in ihe foregoing statement. He also
gave some additional information, which
shows that lie had the welfare of the State
in mind when consummating the arrange
ment.
"By this transaction," he said, "the
trust did not, as you will perceive, secure
a controlling interest in the factory. That
is stul in my hanas, so that we will always
be in a position to compete in the open
market. It is understood tuat tUe trust
will co-operate with me in the work of de
veloping the beet-sugar industry in this
State by the erection of anumoeiuf fac
tories as fast as they are required. Their
establishment will depend, o: course, on
the rapidity of the growth of sugai-beei
plantation.-. It is a;so tlteir intention to
dfvelop this industry throughout the
United States.
'â¢'1 his wiil mean a large investment of
Eastern money in our State, tne enhance
ment of land values wherever sugar beets
can be grown and the resulting prosperity
of the a.: j cent and surrounding country.
It has been repeatedly demonstrated that
the profits of sugar-beet growing are
larger per acre tuan lor any other crop
that can be grown on the same land."
Mr. Spreckels quoted figures from actual
results showing that where 225 acres
planted to barley returned but $12 75 per
acre i>rotit, the very same land in sugar
beets neaeii $59 33 per acre. In another
instance about tbe .-ame quantity of land
on an uive-iment of about $10,000, includ
ing $7 \er acre for :ent, returned tbe
sugar-beet grower v protit of over $7000.
"Another important outcome of this
new arrangement," continued Mr. Spreek
els, "is that the price o; sugar will be
equalized thiougliout the United States.
At the present time the price is about a
ualf cent Higher ou the Pacific Coast than
it i> in the East, and this induces many
large iocal consumers of sugar to go to
China for the r supplies. Wiien all tne
details of the new deal are carrud out the
prices on ibecoaibt will be reduced to what
the ruling figures are in the East."
â 'There has been a great deal of talk of
your being opposed to th* renewal of the
reciprocity treaty with Hawaii, by which
sugar is allowed to come in irce from the
islands," remarked the interviewer.
"I have large interests in the Hawaiian
I lands," began Mr. Spreckels. "I am a
large owner in three sugar plantations.
Likewise I have a good deal ot pronerty

Adoluh 15. and John 1). are interested in
the firm of W. G. Irvin & Co.
"1 have heretofore remained neutral in
the matter o; the abrogation of the re
ciprocity treaty with Hawaii, but when
you ask me the direct question as to my
views on the subject I, as an American
citizen, feel compelled to say that it is a
one-sided affair.
"In the first year of the treaty there
were only 10,000 tons of sugar produced in j
the islands. Last year the product iiad
increased to 223,000 tone, and this year's
e-timate places the crop at 235,000 tons.
Thi-< vast industry has been built up by
our country in permitting the nucar from
the islands to come in hfee free of duty.
"The remission of duty on Hawaiian
sugar amounts to date to the enormous
sum of $73,000,000. If tbe present treaty,
as included La the tariff bill under con
sideration by the Senate at the present
time, remains In operation it will give to
the islands about $7,000,000 per annum as
a virtual bounty on the sugar raised there
and exported to thi-* country, and this
amount will practically come out of the
pockets of the citizens of this country. If j
the treaty is continued they will eventu- i
ally bring their annum crop of sugar up
to 300.0'J0 tons. New plantations are being
opened up right aong, and with the re- I
ciproci y treaty as an incentive the |
amount of production will increase every
year. This will result in injury to the
sugar industry of this and other States of
the Union.
"There is realiy nothing reciprocal
about this treaty " to-day. It is all one
sided. The balance of trade in tav^r of
the inlands amounts to about $7,000,000 or
$8,000,000 per annum. The articles im
ported from tnis country are only such as
they cannot obtain cheaper elsewhere.
Since the advent of the Canadian line they
have imported hay, lumber, grain, pota
toes and other merchandise, formerly pur
chased in this country, from Canada. Most
of tneir other importations now come
from England, France and Germany, a*
the import duty is only 10 per cent, not
enough to favor importations from this
country.
"For these reasons I am in favor of tbe
abrogation of the treaty, as I look first to
the protection of home industries."
"How about Pearl River Harbor, which
was ceded as a coaling station to the
United States as one of the conditions of
the reciprocity treaty? Would that not
be lost to the United States?" was asked.
"Not at ali. I believe that the rignt that
the Government of this country acquired
to the harbor when the treaty wat made
gave it a title for all time, whether the
treaty was continued after its original life
had expired or not. But even if that
were lost to our Government it would not
b.' anything to mourn over, as the harbor
would be useless in case of war.
"Surrounding the entrance to the har
bor i? a coral reef, and it would cost sev
eral millions of dollars to blast enough of
this away to make a pa^age for ships to
enter the inland body of water, which is
the haroor proper. To maintain this en
trance free of obstruction would also be a
continual sou.'cc of expense to the Gov
ernment, as the coral insects would re
sume operations at once and at
tempt to close the gap that had been
artificially made. But even assuming
] that the entrance was opened and couid
be kept so, the harbor would simply be a
trap for the vessels that would attempt to
use it during a period of war.
"As i have already stated, Pearl River
Harbor is an inland sheet of water four or
j five miles from the ocean, and tD reach
| it vessels would have to thread a narrow
and devious channel, which would i lace
them at tue mercy of any hostile fleet
lying outside; and should one of our war
ships be Mink in the channel it would ef
fectua ly blockade all the other vessels
that were sheltered in tne inner harbor.
Or the enemy might, by some strategic
move, sink one of its own vessels in ttie
channel, and this would not only blockade
all our vessels that were inside, but would
prevent tbe use of the harbor at just such
a time when we would have the most
urgent use for it."
This is t l iÂ« first time that Mr. Spreckels
has openly avowed his opposition to the
renewal of the Hawaiian reciprocity
treaty, but it has been known to the
sugar-beet growers for some time. When
the reet farmers of San Benito, Monterey
and Fresno counties were securing signa
tures to a petition to be presented to Con
gress favoring the abrogation of ihe treaty,
he was approached with great diffidence
by the officials of the Fresno and
Hollister banks, as they did not know
how he felt about the matter. They were,
therefore, agreeably surprised when he
informed them of his being in iavor of
abrogation.
Just before concluding the interview
Mr. Spreckels stated that in a year from
now the two factories at Watsonville and
near Salinas will be able to supply the
whole Pacific Coast with f-u^ar. He also
took occasion to say that the trust did not
control either the Watsonvilla beet-sugar
factory or ihe We.-tern Sugar Refinery â
that they simply owned an interest in
each of these establishments, neither of
which was in the trust.
It was further learned from other sources
that t'je trust had not secured any inter
est in the two beet-sugar factories, located
at China and Alvarado, and owned re
spectively by the Oxnard Bros, and the
Alameda Sugar Company.
WILL FAVOR ABROGATION
Senator Perkin> Will Oppose the
Continuance of the Hawaiian
Treaty.
Decl;res That the Growing Beet-
Sugar Industry of the State
Nefd Protection.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 21 East
ern papers ibis afternoon published the
news printed in The Call this morning
that Harold M. bewail of Maine will be
appointed Minister to Hawaii. It is be
lieved in diplomatic and Congressional
circles that ti.e selection ol bewail mean?
that tbt administration will urge the an
nexation of the is.andj,
Meanwhile the right ior and against the
abrogation of the Hawaiian reciprocity
treaty is getting hot. Senator Perkins to
day presented to the Seriate two huge pe
titions from California, one favoring and
the other opposing the treaty's abroga
tion. The petitions were referred to the
Foreign Relations and the Finance com
mittees.
A lively debate is sure to bo precipita
ted over the abrogation of the treaty,
whether the proposition comes from the
Finance Committee or as an amendment
proposed by Senator Mills.
To offset this Senator Chandler will
doubtless repeat his former argument
that the United States ought not to
jeopardize its ascendancy in the Pacific,
while Senator Morgan will insist that the
existence of the treaty gives this country
a command of the Hawaiian situation not
to be wilfully thrown away.
The news of the possible action of the
Finance Committee has greatly excited
the Pacific Slop-. Senator Perkins has
already tiled the petition of the California
btate Grange in lavor of abrogating the
treaty, and yesterday he received the peti
tion of a large number of representative)
merchants, manufacturers and capitalists
in San Francisco taking the opposite
view. This petition denies tbut the
United States have been the losers by
the operations of the treaty.
Senator Aldrich is said to be strongly
opposed to the treaty's continuance, and
it l^ considered probable that the tariff
bill 10 be reported from the Finance Com
mittee will provide for its abrogation.
Mr. Mills of Texas will make a speech in
support of this proposition.
The possible abrogation of the treaty
brings up the important question of
whether the right granted to the United
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 22, 1897.
States in that treaty to exclusively use
Pearl River harbor and establish a coaling
station there would also l&li to the ground
at tbe same time.
Senator Frye, who has Riven the ques
tion considerable thought, said that
morally the United States would have to
abandon the harbor, but legally it could
keep posj-ession.
"At tlie time of the negotiation of the
treaty," said Mr. Frye, "the Foreign Re
lations Commute â¢ was unanimously of the
opinion that the cession of the harbor was
for all time, but Minister Carter, asking
an opinion of the State Department, was
informed by Secretary Bayard that the
ri^bt to t' c ii a r b > r expired witti the
treaty. Personally, I don't think we
could hold the harbor and look any other
nation in the face. I don't believe,
though, that the treaty will be abrogated.''
Senator Mills, who has been fighting for
the repeal of the treaty for twenty years,
said that the Pearl Harbor question did
not enter into the question at all. "We
will keep the harbor, if need be," said he.
"We nuve already given the Hawaiians
some $70,000,000 in remitted duties and
that ought to pay for any harbor on earth.
The treaty was illegally negotiated in the
iirst place.
"Tha House of Representatives is em
powered to raise revenue and it should
have been consulted when there was a
proposition to release millions and mil
lions of revenue. The ratification of the
treaty by the Senate was an act of usurpa
tion. 1 shall certainly do all I can to se
cure its repeal."
In this connection it Is interesting to
know that Secretary Sherman believes
that the abrogation "of the treaty would
not carry with it the !oss of Pearl Harbor.
When the subject was last before the S?n
ate he ma .<â¢ bis position very plain. "We
have an absolute, undeniable, unqualified
grant," said he, "which was originally

Receiving Hospital.
paid for by $23,000,000, to say nothing of
an extension ol seven years, which was
given. WÂ« have paid and doubly paid for
that harbor; we own it now; it is in our
possession."
Although a two-thirds vote is required
to ratify a treaty the abrogation can be se
cured by a mnjonty vote. Whether this
majority vote can be obtained is of course
a matter more for speculation than cer
tain prediction at this time.
Of the^e eleven, Messrs. Aldrich. Allen,
Cafferry, Cullom, Hansbrotijih, Mills and
Pettigrear are still in the Senate. Cir
cumstances then, however, were much
different from what they are at the
present time. The amendment was
offered i/i opposition to the Finance Com
m ttee. and the Democrats, with two ex
ceptions, stood by their party. If the
proposition comes before a session with
the indorsement of ttie Finance Commit
tee it will have a muci better status in
court, bo to speak, and besides this the
development of the beet-sugar industry
has done much to stimulate opposition.
Three years ago mere was no one more
antagonistic to the abrogation of the
treaty tnan Senator Perlcins. Mr. Per
kins is now inclined to think that a ma
jority of the Semite favors abrogation and
he included himself in this majority.
While several causes are operating to
bring about the abrogation of tne treaty,
the rao-t important v the belief that the
Uni ed States is getting considerably the
worst of the bargain. Senator Perkins
Bays: "Reciprocity oueht to reciprocate,
tout in this ca^e it dees not seem to do ?o.
Under the treaty all the sugar produced
in Hawaii comes in Iree of duty. The
amount li.is Meinl'.ljr r:ien until in 1892 it
ngsrrecatpd $Â«,000,000 and last year was
nearly $12,000,000.
"Tins repre-ents the amount of money
we pay the sugar-growers in t lie island*.
In the new tariff the duly on su^ar is $.; i
a ton. As we remit that duty in favor of
the Hawaiians, it mean* (but wo present
them with a bounty of $30 a ton on all the
sucarthey produce.
"There is no reason why we should
mako that discrimination in their favor.
"They take goods from vi.to be Â»ure,but
only about $3,000 00U or $4,000,000 a year,
so that the balance of trade is immensely
in their favor. While the value of our
purchases from them has increased at the
rate of $1,000,000 a year our xports last
year to them were only $200,000 larger
than they were in 1892. luis is the nub
of the whole matter, so lÂ«r as our imports
and exports are concerned. As for
our own interests, I know that
at the Watsonville sujiar factory in
my State, during the nve months*
and a half of the *ugar campaign, there
was paid out $4400 a day to farmers for
their sugar beet;*, while $1200 a day addi
tional was paid out for laoor, lime nnd
fuel. While I am aware that there is a
very strong protest in San Francisco
against abrogatine the treaty I feel that
the people of the State rrould rather have
the treaty abolished, and 1 must also con
sider their interests.' 1
"It is said tb.st the abrogation of the
treaty and the consequent imposition of
the sugar tariff on the Hawaiian product
would bankrupt the planters of the
islands," remarked The Call's corres
pondent.
"It would do nothing of the kind,"
promptly responded Mr. Perkins. '-These
p.antations now pay 25 per cent on the
money invested. Witn the duty on iuear
they would pay 10 or 12 per cenU"
CRAZED BY TOO
MUCH HARD WORK
The Sad Illness of Miss
Flora McDonald
Shearer.
For Twenty-Three Years She
Was a Teacher in the
Pub ;c Schools.
The Authoress of "The Legend of
Au'm" Found in Distress
Near the Presidio.
Miss Flora McDonald Shearer, the au
thoress of "Tho Legend of Aulus," a vol
ume of clever poems, and a prominent
teacher in the Washington Grammar
School, was conveyed yesterday afternoon
to Dr. Whitwell's private asylum at San
Mateo.
Miss Shearer entered the School Depart-
ment twenty-three years ago, shortly
after reaching this City from her home in
Scotland.
She has alwnys been an energetic and
hard worker. Her ambition to attain dis
tinction in the literary world caused her
to overhix her powers, ana her friends
have noticedwith pain her gradual falling
off in health. This lia been apparent
especially during the past month.
Last Friday Mrs. Bucknall, wife of the
well-known physician, who has been a
friend of Miss fcfhearer lor th; past twenty
years, called on her at the school. She
escorted h< r home, where Dr. Bucknafl
cave her calmine potions. Monday night
she was lei: in charge of MiÂ»n McKenzie,
with whom she resides, at 1513>4 Taylor
street. The young woman relaxed her
vigilance Tuesday morning and Miss
Snearer left the house. A note found in
her room stated she had gome to the
Home of Peace Cemetery.
The police were notified late Tuesday
night that she had failed to return home,
and her de-cr. ptiun was sent to the out
side station*-.
About 6 o'clock yesterday morning Offi
cer Gaynor of the North End station ob
served a woman acting strangely on the
beach near the Presidio. She was scantily
attired and her >kirts were dripping wet.
The officer addressed her, and soon
learned that not only was xhe the missinc
