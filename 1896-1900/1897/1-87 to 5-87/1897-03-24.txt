LONDON, Eng., March 23.â The Morn
ing Leader wiil to-morrow give promi
nence to a private telegram from Paris
declaring that the powers have accept d
the proposal by the Sultan that King
George of Greece shall occupy and admin
ister the Government ot Crete, Turkey
â¢ reserving her imperial right in the inland. Â«
The proposal provides that King George
shall nominate a high commission for the
island. Rumor to the above effect is not
new. Its repetition from Paris is accepted
with much reserve, as t.>e Morning Leader
is not a first-class authority.
The Chronicle wiU to-morrow make an
announcement similar to the telegram
published by the Morning Leader, but
under reserve. Nevertheless it expresses
some belief in the general correspondence
of the report with the facts. It is stated
that tne King of Greece will nominate his
son, Prince George, as High Commis
sioner. It is understood that the meeting
was discussed at the Cabinet meeting to
day.
The Athens correspondent of the Chroni
cle telegraphs that M. Onou, the Russian
Minister, at the audience given to him
* yesterday by King George merely pre-
Asented to his Majesty letters from the Czar
y and the Dowager Empress of Russia. The
letter of the Czar contained 50,000 roubles
for the benefit of tne Cretan refugees in
Athens. M. Onou has just returned from
S T : Petersburg.
CAXEA, Cf.kte, March 23.â Three hun
dred French troops, tne tirst of trie re-on
forcements. ordered to Crete for service,
landed at Suda to-day. Later they were
marched to tbis c;ty. Three hundred
other French troops will go to Sitia, at
the eastern end of the isiand.
Admiral Canevaro, the Italian officer
who is in command of the combined
fleets, has issued a proclamation enjoin
ing the insurgents and GreeK troops not
to attack the Turkish forts at Kissarao,
Bnda, Malaza, Renmo, Candia and Hiera
petra, these forts being necessary for the
maintenance of order at the ports where
the foreign troops will be disembarked.
The proclamation closes with a warning
that measures will be taken to insure re
spect for it. It is doubted that the insur
pents wiil pay auy heed to the proclama
tion.

LONDON, Eng., March 23. âIn the
House of Commons . Mr. ;G. N. Curzon,
Under Foreign Secretary, in _ reply ,to a
cfuestion by Sir Charles Dilke, said that
the Government had . not received any
proposals â from Greece looking to a com

In reply to a question by John Me-
Neill, anu-Parr.eliile, Mr. Curzon said
i hat Turkey was not taking any part in
the blockade of Cretan nbrts, and that the

CANADA WILL RETALIATE.
A Tariff Measure in Preparation That Is
Calculated to Offset the Dmgley
Bill.
OTTAWA, O.\T., March 23.â Parliament
will assemble on Thursday of this week.
The -bud set will be introduced in the ses
sion and a tariff bill also. Tbe latter will
likely seem a|surprise to Canada and to a
not inconsiderable portion of the export
ers of tbe United States. It is foreshad
owed that a general reduction wil! be made
in the classes of goods imported which
can be readily obtained from Great
Britain and a corresponding increase on
those goods forming the bulk of imports
from the United States. This, it is under
stood, will be Canada's answer to the
Dineley bill.
While the Liberal Government made
the chief plank of its ante-election plat
â¢form "the greatest measure of free trade
possible and reciprocal treaty relations
with the United States," they have exe
cuted a right-about-face movement, aban
doned free trade, except as a theory, and
dumped all pretensions of "better terms"
with the United States.
As the leading organ of the Govern
ment, the Toronto Globe, puts it: "If we
regard the question as mainly between
free trade and protection, we shall mist
the chief lesson of the situation. That
lesson is that we must look to Great
Britain rather than to the United States
as the outlet for our surplus products, and
that our system of transportation as well
as our tariff must be adjusted in accord
ance with that condition."
Continuing;, the Globe, which is regard
ed as the mouthmece of the Government,
says: "Our business as Canadians is to
get our products into the British market
so cheap and so cood as to be preferred on
tiieir merits to those of the United States
and other countries. Our business is als
to give to those who offer us a free mar
ket all the trade advantages in our power,
and this mu-t be done in an intelligent
way, not merely with the purpose of mak
ing a show of hostility to our neighbors.
Our object should be not to show resent
ment against them, but to strengthen
ourselvesâ to make ourselves more and
more independent of the notions ol
American legislators and of changes In
American public opinion."

CONSTANTINOPLE, Tcbkey, March
23. â In consequence of the troubles at
Tokit Sir Philip Currie. the British Em
bassador, has sent to the Porte the strong
est remonstrance that has yet been ad
dressed to the Government in an official
communication.
ThÂ« official report of the affair said that
fifteen Armenians and three Mussulmans
werÂ« killed, but the Embassadors have
learned that at least 100 Armenians were
killed. The peoDle were killed wljile in
church. During and after the massacre
the Armenian quarter was given over to
pillage.
The Turkish newspapers in their com
ments upon the blockade of Crete re
mark upon the pacific attitude of the
powers toward Turkey. Their attitude,
they say, is conformable with the rights
and (political interests of the Porte and
furnishes fresh proof of the striking suc
cess that has been gained by the Sultan.
It also testifies to the friendship of the
powers for the Porte and their solicitude
for the peace of the world.

WASHINGTON, D. C. March 23.â
There is quite a rivalry among the mem
bers ol the California delegation for ap
pointment as a member of tiie Rivers and
Harbors Committee. While it is not
known by any whether California will be
represented on the committee, still it is
generally assumed by all that the place
made vacant by the retirement of Repre
sentative Herman of Oregon will be tilled
by Speaker Reed with a representative
from the Pacific Coast. Representative
Barlow, whose district embrace* the
longest line ot sea coast in the United
States, is bringing to. bear upon
Speaker Reed the indorsements of
some of thfÂ» leading men on
the Pacific Coast, among tbem being
Professor George Davidson of the Qeo
.letic and Coast Survey. Captain William
M. Merry of the Sun Francisco Chamber
of Commerce; Colonel C. L. Taylor,
late Republican candidate for Mayor of
San Francisco; President Miller of the
Savings Union ; A. H. Rose, president of
the River and Harbor Convention of Cali
lomia, and Hon. Hugh Craig, secretary.
He ban also the indorsement of all the
Populist members in Congress and ot the
recent River and Harbor Convention of
California. Judge Baiham ot the Fifth
District also hÂ«s his eye on the vncant
seat of Herman. Barlow being a Popu
list and Barham a Republican, the proba
bilities are that the laiter (D.trhann will
be appointed if California is represented
on the River and Hnrbor Committee.
Representative <le Vries is male dr a fight
to succeed his predecessor, Johnson, as a
member of the Committee on Pacific Rail

member of the Committee on Public

Report on the Marvelous Manner in
Which the Disease Keeps to
Itself.
QUARANTINE, N. V., March 24.â
Health Officer Doty this morning received
a report from the agent whom he ap
pointed in Eprypt to look after vessels
arriving at tue Suez canal from India
during the prevalence of the bubonic
plague in the latter country. The report
says:
"From Bombay I learn of the appar
ently marveious manner in which the
disease keeps to itself. For instance, the
natives live mostly in a large building,
divided into flats. Each flat consists of a
set of rooms divided by a passage or cor
ridor, at the end of which is a common
lavatory.
"It has been known, over and over
again, of a room in a flat with several per
sons in it suffering irom plagae, and vet
not one other individual living in the
same flat has caught the disease, although
the same lavatory has been used. This
was proved aho to be the case during the
last epidemic at Hongkong. Finally,!
maj' mention that his Excellency Rogers
Pasha, inspector-general of the sanitary
department of Egypt, has returned from
Bombay, having made a thorough study
of the sanitary condition of that country.
Hs is of the opinion that the Egyptian
authorities have every facility to prevent
the introduction of the disease."
GRANTS TOMB DESECRATED.
Some Vandal With a Mania for Curio Col-

Granite Pillar.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 23.â The
Herald this morning says: Some vandal,
actuated, doubtless, by a mania for curio
collections, desecrated what will be the
last resting place of General Grant on
Monday nigtit or eariy yesterday morn
ing by chopping away a considerable quan
tity of stone from the upper surface of one
of the granite pillar blocks which support
the head ana foot of the great sarcophagus.
From all appearances it was the work
of an expert stone-cutter, and there is
every indication that the person who
handled the chisel was frightened away
before having completed the task he bad
set himself to do.
The desecration was discovered by
Charles B. Canneld of thÂ« monument
com i. any, when he visited the tomb at
half-past 8 o'clock yesterday morning.
The pillar blocks are of a deep yellowish
brown color, the same as the sarcopagus
itself. Several pieces had been broken
out to the depth of an inch and a half.

908 Broadway, March 23. \
Fernside is in ashes. The beautiful resi
dence of the Cohens in Alameda was
destroyed by fire this morning and all the
valuable and historical works of art that
have been collected during a quarter of a
century are wrecked.
For twenty-tive years Fernside has been
looked upon as one of the most complete
and handsome residences in Alameda
County. Its valuable libiary was the
pride of A. A. Cohen, deceased, and was
gathered by him from all quarters of the
civilized world. The valuable paintines,
many of them works from the brushes of
Rousseau, Corot, Bonheur and Milne
Ramsey, are nearly all in ruina, and the
beautiful bric-a-brac, worth tens of thou
sands of dollars, has shared a similar fate.
The fire was discovered early this morn
ing by Otto Jenkin-, the coachman. Ha
saw the smoke issuing from the roof and
an investigation showed that the whole
npter portion of the garret was ablaze.
As booq as the alarm was sounded two
chemical engines and one :<teamer came
to the tire, but as there was only one
hydrant several blocks away the flames
flaunted defiance at the puny efforts of
the firemen to control them. The single
stream which was pJayed on the fare was
absolutely valueless, and the beat was so
intense that the tiremen were forced to
stand so far away from the burning pile
that their efforts were of no avail. The
little chemical engines exhausted their
usefulness without creating any effect at
all, and it was seen there was no hope for
the structure unless more water could be
obtained.
An attempt was made at 7 o'clock to tap
the main pipe, and with the aid of a fire
plug another hue of hose was brought
into service.
The finmes jumped about as they
pleased. From the roof they encircled the
cupola, the foundations of which were
soon destroyed and the main part fell
through the skylight to the gallery inside
the building. The flames spread to every
portion of the upper story, gradually
worked downward and devoured every
thing to the ground.
By 8 o'c ock the whole northern wing
was one mass of flames and all efforts
were made to try to save the southern
portion of the building. The Fire De
partment, however, although it did its
best and each man worked heroically,
could do nothing, and by 11 o'clock
nothing remained of the palatial home
except live tall chimneys and a small
portion of the framework of the lower
floor.
A. A. Cohen built Fernside in 1872,
when he was at the zenith of his pros
perity. Beiore building he sold out fcia
railroad and ferry enterprises to the Cen
tral P.icitic syndicate. He built the
broad-gauge railroad from Alameda Point
to Haywards and was a bold speculator,
but he was sagacious enough not to at
tempt to compete with Stanford and
Huntington, so be allowed all his trans
portation properties to be absorbed by the
Western Pacific. In 1877 he had a rup
ture with the railroad company and a big
lawsuit followed, after which Cohen never
regained his former prosperity, although
be remained a wealthy man up to the
time of his death.

for the value of the lumber that was used
in its construction. The case never went
to tiial, but it was the subject of great re
mark at the time. One of the stories of
tue origin of tlie supply of lumber was
that the firm of Meictis & Gorley made an
agreement with Mr. Cohen to furnish him
with lumber enough to build "a house" if
he wouid use his influence to procure for
them a contract to supply the railroad
company with lumber for bridges and
snowsbeits.
Cohen obtained the contract and then
demanded the lumber. Bat instead of
the simple "house" that the dealers had
expected they were called upon to supply
the material for a great mansion. It was
all of the best and heaviest, too, and they
sought to evade their agreement, but were
unable to. It is said that there was a
large surplus after the mansion was com
pleted and that this w.-nt into the Palace
Hotel in San Francisco.
The honse was stored with valuables. It
was a three-story structure which origi
nally cost $125,000, esciusive of the luxri
ous decorations. Every wall was frescoed
and all the woodwork was of tne finest ob
tainable. There were between iorty and
fifty roo^ns. including a music hall, pic
ture galiery, library, billiard parlors and
extensive drawing-rooms. The main ball
ran directly through from east to west
and pillars of solid onyx supported
bronzea and statuary on eitner side, while
the delicately inlaid floor was a marvelous
work of art
In the picture gallery was the original
"Marguerite," which was finished in Paris
in 1878 and which is valued at $50,000. It
is so badly burned as to be beyond repair.
Ramsey's famous "Deatb Bed Soene" was
carried out, and is not injured.
As soon as the hre was discovered most
of the furniture was carried out from the
ground floor, but on the second ar.d third
floors, where the most valuable goods
were placed, little could be removed. With
very few exceptions all the valuable works
of art gathered from the salons and gal
leries of Europe were destroyed.
The decorations of the interior of the
house were done by European artists, who
spent a whole year at the work, and for a
Jong time these frescoes were separately
insured. Oi fifty paintings in the gallery
only ten were saved.
The value of all that wcs taken from the
house by those who tried in vain to save
the iurniture will not amount to more
than $5000.
The origin of the fire is a mystery, and j
there are some peculiar circumstancea
connected with it. It is said that neigh
bors living near saw the flames an hour
or so before the alarm was given, but
would not take the trouble tnemselves to
turn in an alarm, as they hold the owners
oi the property in great detestation. The
gardener says he saw the fire about 5
o'clock, but it was more than half an hour
before an alarm was given. The watch
man made his rounds an hour before tne
fire broke out, and says he saw nothing
out of the way. It is reported that mem
bers of the family allege incendiarism as
the origin, and again it is ascribed to a
defective flue. It was customary to build
tires in the house at intervals in order to
prevent damage from dampness, and this
had been done quite recently. It is thought
that in some way this may have been the
origin of the fire. It is understood that
the underwriters will make a thorough
investigation of all the circumstances ana
reports.
Besides the furniture belonging to the
estate there was in the house a large
quantity of valuable furniture belonging
to Mr?. G. L. Lansing, widow of the for
mer secretary of the Southern Pacific.
An incident of the tire was the presence
of Deputy Sheriff White of Oakland, who
took advantage of the presence of Mrs.
Cohen to serve some papers upon her for
wiiich he had long been soekiag an oppor
tunity, but had so far been successfully
baiked in his effort. However, the ex
citement of the occasion caused toe lady
to relax her customary watchfulness, and
the papers were served before she could
prevent it.
It was 1:30 this afternoon before the fire
was extinguished and the firemen were
permitted to return home. During the
forenoon Mrs. Cohen had coffee and re
freshments served to the firemen. A large
crowd was drawn from all the surround
ing country, who remained till the de
struction of the building was complete.
A remarkable feature of the affair, botb
while trie fire was burning and after it had
finished its work, was the entire absence
of any expressions of sympathy from auy
source.
Mrs. Cohen knew nothing about the fire
until the news had spread all over the
city. She is living with her aon Edgar on
Versailles avenue.
"All I know," she said, "is that tbe
house is now a complete ruin, and mostoi
tbe valuable paintings and things are de
stroyed. The insurance on the place is
nothing like its real value, and I know tbe
loss to me will be fully $300,000, even with
the insurance."
Edgar Cohen estimat s the loss at fully
$500,000.
The insurance on the property was
handled by A! Cammings. "The place is
a complete loss." he said. "The little fur
niture saved amounts practically to
nothing. Tne bouse was one of the hand
somest on the coast, while the art gallery
coula not be beaten by any private collec
tion in the country. I have the inventory
Of the goods, but the insurance will only
partially cover the loss. The total amount
of insurance aggregates $155,000, dis
tributed among the following companies:
Commercial Union, $9000.
Western of Toronto, $7500.
American of New Jersey, $2500.
Fire Association, $7500
Caledonian, $4500.
Scottish Union and National, $10,000.
Lancastershire, $5000.
American of New York, $7500.
Providence o( Washington, $2500.
Hartford, $4500.
Insurance Company of North America,
Â«5000.
Alliance of London, $5000.
Manchester, $4500.
Pliosnix of London, $7500.
Imperial. $4000.
Some of the Rare Books and Art Gems Ruined by the Elements at the Alameda Fire.
TJnion of London, $6000.
St. Paul, $2500.
Liverpool. London and Globe, $2500.
National of Hartford, $5500.
Sun of London, $2500.
Palatine, $2500.
Trans-Atiautic, $5000.
AVilliamsburg City, $2500.
Home and Phoenix, $17,500.
Northwestern National, $2500.
Westchester, $3000.
New Zealand, $5000.
Franklin, $2500.
North British and Mercantile, $5000.
It is a singular coincidence that all
three of the retired railroad and steam
boat capitalists who have built splendid
homes in Alameda County have been
burned out. The Ainsworth mansion at
Claremont, the beautiful residence of
Captain It. E. Thompson in Alameda and
the Cohen mansion have all met the same
fate. The Thompson place, not far from
the Cohen mansion, was barned down
about teu years ago. The loss was over
$100,000, with no insurance. The captain
had his hou-e tilled with thermostats,
hosepipes and otner tire-preventing de
vices, and had carefully trained hia ser
vants as a fire brigade, but when his place
took tire in his absence one afternoon the
domestic fire company was demoralized
and the house speedily burned to the
ground.
Three of the firemen were injured to
day while working against the great ex
isting odds. Fred Caracof had his arm
badly burned by a falling timber, and Gus
Wagner while breaking a window lost a
large portion of two fingers. Charles
Frost was also caught by some falling
wreckage and badly burned. The dis
tance of the home from the nearest fire
department seriously handicapped the
wors of the department, and although the j
men did all that was possible, their work
really went for nothing.
The lack of hydrants was partly due to
the objection made by the family to hav
ing a street opened through the Cohen
| property. These improvements .were de
sired so that the east end of Alameda
could be improved. They were vigorously
fought by the family, who objected to
having the old homestead broken up. As
a consequence there was only one hydrant
within several blocks of the house. Now
that the building is removed, it is more
than 1 kely that the desired improve
ments wili be made and that the Cohen
demesne will nor long remnin intact.
TARIFF COMPLICATION.
Senators May Ignore the Dinghy Measure
and Substitute a " Greater
McKnley Bill."
NEW YORK, N. V., March 23. -A
Time* special from Wasnington says:
The Senate Finance Committee is af
fected just now by the criticism of the
tariff bills to a degree not appreciated in
the House.
It is learned from the late talk of Sen
ators who are not ready to be quoted that
a tariff bill will be made in the Senate
without strict regard for the bill made in
the House. That being the case, the Sen
ate desires plenty of time to do its work.
The Finance Committee says the House
has taken all the time it thought neces
sary. The Republicans of the Senate
committee have been consulted, but not
all of them. A slight variation of opinion
in that committee would turn the bill in
side out. The mem oers insist that they
are entitled to have as much time to
think about tbe bill and to make calcula
tions as the members of the House.
This being the state of affairs in the
Senate it is not material whether the Dem
ocrats of the House agree to fight the
Dingley bill as a whole or split it >n part
and reject it in other particulars. The ac
tion of the House seems likely to be any
thing but instructive to the Senate.
Before the bill gets to the Senate the
men who were unable to get a hearing or
any favor&ble response from the Ways and
Means Committee will nave begun their
arguments with 'the Senate. Indeed, they
already liave stopped arguing with tbe
House. Hearings will be requested and
many will be allowed. The information
V at has already been considered will be
offered again, and possibly will be consid
ered with different conclusions.
By July or August the meaning of the
Dingtey bill i - likely to be better under
stood, and it is not tit all improbable that
September may be here before the "greater
McKinley bill" shall have gone to the
President for his signature.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 24, 1897.
TARIFF DEBATE
IN THE HOUSE
Dockery of Missouri Leads
the Opposition to the
Measure.
Dolliver of lowa Supports the
Bill in a Speech That Is
Amusing.
New.ands of Nevada Finds an Open
ing to Sp ak in the Interest
of Si v r.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 23.â L ss
than two score Representatives were in
their seats at 10 o'clock to-day when the
House assembled under the special order
for the consideration of the tariff bill.
Before proceeding with -that, however,
Wilson (D.) of South Carolina appeared at
the oar and was sworn in by Speaker
Reed.
The first speaker of the day was Gibson
(R.) of Tennessee, in support of the bilL
Doikery (D. ) of Missouri opposed the
bill. Speaking for himself, and he be
lieved for the Democratic party, he pre
lerred to legislate to put $113,000,000 more
money into circulation rather ihnn to ex
ercise the sovereign powei of taxation and
thus withdraw that amount from taxation.
[Applause.]
Dockery referred to Dingley's character
ization of the Wilson-Gorman bill as a
"monster," and twitted the majority of
the Committee of Ways and Means with
Dingley's admission yesterday that the
iron and steel and cotton schedules of that
"monster" had been practically copied
into the bill under discussion.
"What," he asked, "caused the awful
Homestead riot on June 30, 1892, before
Cleveland was nominated and while the
McKinley law was in operation, if pros
perity was its handmaid?"
Dalzell â That riot grew out of a contest
between organized labor and those whoop
posed it.
Dockery (triumphantly and emphati
cally)â And armeu Pinkerton detectives
were employed by Carnegie, a protected
manufacturer, to shoot down striking
workinnmeti. [Loud Democratic ap
plause.]
Dockery devoted himself for the re
mainder of bis time to a consideration of
the agricultural schedule, to show that it
would not aff >rd any benefit or relief to
the farmers of the country, for the reason
that there are no importations of their
products with which their own come into
com petition.
Dockery said in conclusion that the
Republican party had cost the working
man his wages, had surrendered to Groat
Britain the supremacy of the seas and
impoverished the farmers of the land.
[Loud applause.]
Newland (Sil.) of Nevada was tbe next
speaker. He illustrated his remarks by a
map showin - tbe distribution of the vari
ous forms of money among the various
nations of the world. This showed, ne
said, that the United Stnte3, Great Britain,
France, Germany and Russia held three
quarters of ail the gold in existence.
Newlands (Sil.) of Nevuda discussed the
tar ff Dill from the standpoint of the sil
ver men who united with the Democrats
and Populists during tbe last camraign in
opposition to the Republicans. This al
liance, he said, still continued and was
likely to amalgamate the allied forces
into one strong party, with silver as the
Bole and dominant i-sue, all other ques
tions being subordinate to it ana th c
largest tolerance being exercised as to th c
difference of opinion on other question 8
which bad hitherto divided tbe variou s
elements constituting the silver forces
Much depended in tbe future upon th â¢
tolerance, the wisdom and the conserv*
ati -m of the different parties in their el
forts for the main issue.
There was no question as to the tariff ;
the Dopu<ar verdict at the last election was
in favor of protection. Had the Demo*
cratic party declared the tariff to be tbe
leading issue it would have been over
whelmingly defeated. It acted wisely
when it announced a truce regarding the
tariff, and declared silver to be the domi
nant issue, and nearly snatched victory
from the most desperate conditions. Their
victory would have been complete had not
the Democratic party presented other un
necessary issues which handicapped
Bryan's candidacy, furnished pretext for
misrepresentation and abuse and really
divided the friends of silver.
A multiplication of issues created a di
version of strength, and he was satisfied
that in the future the allied forces would
avoid this mistake and would make bi
metallism the crucial issue. As it was,
however, the people had declared in favor
of protection and had given the Republi
can party a contract for prosperity. The
necessity for additional revenue was ap
parent. A.s to the means of raising it
the Republicans proposed to increase
tariff duties instead of resorting to in
ternal taxation.
That party should, in his judgment, be
allowed to carry out any reasonaole tariff
policy without obstruction and with
expedition. If it brought prosperity, all
would De content. If not, it would
quickly be seen that some other remedy
was required, and thus by the process of
elimination we would come down to the
only radical cureâ the full restoration of
silver as a money metal. It was no time
to play small politics.
Lacey (R.) of lowa spoke next in favor
of the bill.
McLaurin (D.) of South Carolina, a
member of the Committee oi Ways and
Means, made a strong plea for protection
to the cotton-planter of the South.
McLaurin was followed by Dolliver (R.)
of lowa, who injected some Humorous and
sprightly features into the debate and was
warmly applauded.
Dolliver said he proposed to give some
of the reasons why, in his opinion, the
pending measure would meet the ap
proval of the American people. The farm
era of toe Mississippi Valley, lie said, had
long ago abandoned the un-American
policy, and last fall had .alien into line in
support of that ereat exemplar of the
doctrine, Major McKinley. [Applause.]
They walked in tne rain- io the polls,
weary with the miserable burdens of four
years of Democratic misrule and bad
legislation, and cast their ballots in favor
of the American policy.
Dolfiver charged that nearly everything
that had been said in the House in favor
of free trade properly belonged to the
literature of the period of human slavery,
in the interest of which institution free
trade had its origin. Grover Cleveland,
he said, was not the only President who
had taken the United States to a loan
office. [Laughter ani applause.] He but
followed tne way often trodden by Martin
Van Buren and James Buchanan. [Ap
plause.]
Swanson (D.) of Virginia then spoke in
opposition to the bili.
Cochran (D.) of Missouri, following
Swanson, said that the industries of the
country had ceased op rations, not be
cause the prices of products wer6 so low
as to afford no profit to the manufac
turers, but because the people had no
money with which to buy the products
and the underlying cause of the present
depression was the demonetization of
silver. He created mucn amusement by
attributing this trouble to that "eminent
Republican leader," Grover Cleveland,
aided by "his distinguished associate,
John Sherman."
When Cochran concluded the commit
tee, rose and the X Senate joint resolution
authorizing the Secretary of War :to pro-"
vide tents for the homeless sufferers by
the Mississippi floods was called up by
McCullocu (D.) of .'Arkansas and was

SEX ATOKS O.V CIVIL SEItUCK.
Humorous InÂ»tÂ»nee* ' itrd to show th*
Law* Jirf'Clm,.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 23.â The
Senate indulged to-day in an almost one
sided denunciation of the civil service law
and its administration. The matter came
up in the shape of a resolution offered by
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska directing the
Committee on Civil Service to inquire
into the dismissal of some half-dozen em
ployes of the Bureau of Animal Industry
in South Omaha, Nebr. His assertion
was that the dismissals were for political
reasons.
Galllnper (R.) of New Hampshire did
not favor the proposed investigation be
cause it would bring out so many hun
dred other like grievances, and Hoar (R.)
of Massachusetts objected to it on the
same grounds, sayin* that such a hercu
lean task should not be thrown ou any
committee at this special session.
The civil service law, as administered,
was characterized by Galiinger as "monu
mental humbug." He favored blotting
out the law and returning to a condition
of things that "would give to every man
and woman an equal right to hold office
with every other man and woman."
Various instances of civil servicft^ex
aminations were furnished by Senators,
Gallinger mentioning the requirement of
compositors in the Government Printing
Office that they should hop twelve times
on one foot.
Wilson (R.) of Washington said that
civil service examinations had been
ordered in his State lor a cook in the
penitentiary and a sawyer on en Indian
reservation, and even Hawley (R.*} of Con
necticut, who bad been a member of the
House which reported the law originally,
admitfed that the commission had fallen
into a state of "conspicuous incompe
tency," giving as an illustration the fact
that when a army engineer officer in
charge of a public work on Long Island
Sourtu had selected a competent inspector
in the person of a steamboat captain who
knew every rock and sandbar in the
neighborhood the commission selected a
"schoolmaster from Rhode Island."
The only Senator who defended the law
and its administration was Lodge (R.)of
Massachusetts.
The upshot of it all was thnt Allen's
motion was agreed to without a division,
bnt amended so asi to instruct the Com
mission on Civil Service and Retrenchment
to inquire and report whether the civil
service law should be continued, amended
or repealed.
The following bills were passed by the
Senate: Directing the Secretary of War to
supply 1000 tents to shelter and relieve
the sufferer* from the flood in tne Missis
sippi River Valley; to establish the offi
cial survey of fractional townships in
Nebraska; to amend the act repealing the
timber culture laws.
The latter bill was explained by Petti
grew (Silver) of South Dakota to be the
same as was passed by both houses last
session; but which the President had been
"too busy fishing" to sign.
The Torrey bankruptcy bill, modified,
was reached, and was on motion of
Hoar made the unfinished businessâ not
to be called ud immediately, however.
A constitutional amendment to make
the 30th of April inauguration day was
introduced by Hoar.
Turpie (D ) of Indiana made an argn
ment in favor of a constitutional amend
ment to make United States Senators
elective by popular vote instead ot by
State Legislatures.
At 3:45 p. X. the Senate adjourned until
to-morrow.

NEW YORK, N. V., March 23.-fhe
Herald this morning -ays: It is probable
that in a very short time the Baron de
Hirsch fund in this country will be aug
mented by a magnificent donation from
his widow. It is stated on good authority
that Oscar S. Strauss, forruer Minister 10
Turkey and one of the trustees of the
Baron de Hirscn fund, who enjoyed a
close personal acquaintance with the
famous philanthropist and who returned
from a trip abroad last Saturday evening,
brought Wttb him the positive a-surance
from the Baroness of her disposition to
give the sum of $1,800,000 to the d fferent
benevolent funds in the United S ate.i.
Of this sum, it is reponed ihat $1,000,000
is to be given to the alleviation of distress
in entirely new charitable channels, which,
those conversant with tho matter expect
will create a creat sensation when the
details become known by their originality
and scope. But the precise nature of the
benevoience i? kept a ciosely guarded
secret for the present.
It was further that $100,000 is to
be yiven to the E iucationai Alliance, in
which Baron de Hirsch took so much
interest, and the remaining $700,000 will
be distributed r.mong the various other
charities, but just what ones, it is
believeu, has not yet been fuliy
determined.

ARCHITECT DODGE IDENTIFIES
THE SUICIDE'S BODY.
All That R. mains for Officer Gibson
to Do Is to Secure Photographs
of the Dead Man.
MERIDIAN, Tex., March 23.â"Pro
fessor Arthur Forbes," as he has been
known for several months past to the
people of Meridian and Kopperl, was
identified this morning at daybrenk by
one who knew him in San Francisco and
who for several months had been his inti
mate friend as Josef E. Blanther, mur
derer of Mrs. .Langfeldt.
G. A. Dodge, who came from California
to say the word that would send the Kop
perl schoolmaster to the gallows, looked
at the dead face of his one-time friend and
said "It is he." But Blanther was be
yond the reach, of the law. From the
time that Blanther was placed under
arrest, while on the point of leaving Kop
perl, by John Womack and Homer Ran
dall, he dreaded the arrival of the Caiifor
nians more than he dreaded death.
Saturday nighi he was told that the offi
cers would most likely arrive Sunday,
and at 12 o'clock that night he quietly
swallowed the poison which he had car
ried for the purpose ot suicide perhaps for
months.
When Dodge was asked if he was cer
tain of Blanther's identity he said: "The
identification is complete. To any one
who knew Blantber as I have known him
there can be no mistake. He was a man
that I would Know in a thousand. He has
now a chin beard, which he was without
when I last saw him, but I know him as I
would my brother. This was not a cheer
ful taste for me. although Blanther in
volved me in his unenviable notoriety. I
have npt the siighiest feeling of ill-wiil
toward him. I would have given much
to weet him *Jive, but it is too late now.
I see that three of Blanther's fingers
bear the marks of what I am sure is the
result of cuts made by his razor when
with his left hand he held back the head
of his victim to make certain the fearful
stroke which nearly severed her head
from her body. This has proved to me
beyond a doubt that Blanther was guilty.
"I believe 1 was the last who knew him
in_|;an Francisco to see him, and I am the
first and only one that knew him there to
see him now. 1 '
Mr. Dodge arrived here on the train at
4 o'clock this morninz. having been on
the journey since the 18; b inst. Detective
Gibson telegraphed from San Antonio
yesterday morning to know of Blanther's
condition. On arriving at Rosenberg
.function he received a telegram from
[sheriff Boyd that Blanther was all
right, so to save time be went at once to
Austin to obtain the necessary papers
for Blantber's requisition, while Dodae
came at once to Meridian. When the office
opened in the morning a telegram was
sent to inform Gibson that Blanther was
dead.
The detective from California is ex
pected to arrive at Meridian to-morrow
morning. Justice ot the Peace A. J. Ste
vens held an inquest this morning. Mr.
Dodge swore to the identity of the dead
wan as Josef E. Blanther, and the verdict
of suicide by means of poison was ren
dered.
The body will be photographed to-mor
row upon Gibson's arrival and will then
be buried. Blantber's effects will betaken
in charge by the officers from California.
LEES IS INFORMED.
The Chlof of Detectives Sorry to
Lose Blenther After Getting
a Complete Case.
Josef E. Blanther, the murderer of
Mrs. Philopena Langfeldt, has cheated
the gallows and saved the State consid
erable expense.
The deadly drug that he swallowed
early Sunday morning in the jail at Meri
dian, Tex., and from which after eighteen
hours' work it was thought he had recov
ered, did its work too well, and he died
Monday night about 8 o'clock.
De:ective Gibson and George A. Dodge,
tiie architect, reached Meridian between
4 and 5 o'clock yesterday morning, and on
reaching the jail they at once identified
.the dead man as Blanther.
When Captain Lees reached his office
yesterday morning he found the following
dispatch from Gibson on his desk:
The man is Blanther. Died at 8 last night.
The captain at once wired to Gibson to
hare photographs made of the murderer
and if there was no photographer at Meri
dian, wuich is a small town of about 800
inhabitants, he was instructed to secure
one from the nearest point. Gibson was
also instructed to take particular notice of
the marks on the deceased's body, so that
â¢there could bo no question as to his iden
tification ana in order that a showing may
be made in the Superior Court when the
matter of the Grand Jury indictment
comes up for final Disposition.
. Tne personal effects of the deceased
have been secured by Gibson, and he will
bring them with him on his return to the
City. "
The physicians and jail officials made
every effort to saveÃlantber's life, as a re
ward of $1000 was offered lor his arrest and
conviction. At one time it was thought
that all danger was past, but toward even
ing he took a turn for the worse and sank
rapidly.
Blanther appears to have made no con
fession, and when questioned he abso
lutely refused to talk. Shortly before he
died he said he taueht school in Southern
California at one time during his life, and
"poke of a brother in France who went un
der the name of Charles Carter. In his
delirium he frequently muttered tbe name
of McDonald, but in his conscious mo
nients he refused *to ; say who McDonald
was. ggs . y â 'â ,â  " ' â  ; -' '-:,
Captain LÂ°cs feels keenly the disap
pointment of being cheated out of his
prey. He has worked hard and asiduously
for "months to bring the murderer: to
justice, and never lost faith in his ability
to attain that end; : -.',,..:: _ â¢ â
7 "I ; had a complete case against him,
said the caprain. "and his con
viction was certain. After all these months
of hard, work it is t/j bad to lose him jiist
when he was within our L-rasp. ,
. "What do I think of the man? I think
he wa3 a moral monstrosity and one oi"
the most infamous criminals of the cen
tury."
A dispatch from Texarkana. Tex., ex
piesses the fear that Aduie Walker, the
woman who lived with Blanther at Kop
perl. T*x., as hi.x wife, has met with foul
play. She leii Kopparl last December,
tellinj: her friends" that she was going to
Texarkana on a visit 10 her grandmother;
but she did not arrive there, and her rela
tives haveiheard nothing of her since.
Captain Lees, said yesterday he believed
the woman was alive and well.

RATE-CUTTING
All Railroad Associations
to Be Forced Out of

Decision of the Supreme Court
Leaves No Loophole of
E cape.
Already th? Lading L nes Are With
drawing and Preparing to
Slash Rates.
CHICAGO. 111., March 23.â Within a
week it is expected by high railroad offi
cials that not one of the organizations
having jurisdiction over passenger and
freight rates will De in existence in this
country as a result of the plain decision
of the United States Supreme Court that
all associaMons which have for their pur
pose the maintenance of agreed rates and
the division of traffic are illegal. The
oldest organizations of this character must
co to pieces. There is no loophole for es
cape, in fact, the work of disintegration
began in this city to-day, the legal ad
visers of great railroads b a ine quick to
grasp the hopelessness of the situation, so
far as continued membership in these as
sociations was concerned.
General Solicitor Kenna of the Santa Fe
system advised the traffic manager of that
road to withdraw immediately from all
freight associations of which it has been
a member. Mr. Kenna also advised the
Santa Fe's withdrawal from all passenger
associations.
A long consultation with other attor
neys of the Chicago, Milwankes and St.
Paul road was held by General Solicitor
Peck. Before the meeting of lawyers
Peck stated he would advise the St. Paul's
withdrawal at once from all associations.
The counsel for the Chicago, Rock Inland
and Paciiic Railroad advised the officers
that the only legal course to pursue was
to sever connection with all associations.
On reliable authority it was stated that
the following important lines have decid
ed to withdraw: St. Louis and San Fran
cisco, Minneapolis and St. Louis, Chicago,
Great Western and Wisconsin Central.
The peremptory action of all these com
panies means the certain disruption of the
following associations and committees:
Western Freight Association, Transcon
tinental Passenger Association, Western
Passenger Association, Southwestern Traf
fic Association, Trans-Missouri freight
Association, Southwestern Passenger Com
initter, Mississippi Valley Freight Asso
ciation, St. Paul and Minneapolis Rate
Association, Colorado Freight Association,
the local passenger associations of St.
Lcuis, Colorado Spring?, Pueblo, Denver
and Chicago, Local Freight Agents' Asso

of General Passenger Agents, Chicago and
St. Louis Traltic Association, Western

Terminal Fieight Association.
The life of these foregoing associations
is. dependent on the unity of action of all
members, and the withdrawal of one line
may be followed by the making of lower
rates which would immediately result in
all the other competing lines quittinz the
associations.
Officers of Western roads interviewed by
the United Associated Presses this after
noon w> re divide l on the effect which to
day's decision would have on rates. Of
ficials of the Sania Fe said they saw no
reason why rates should become demoral
ized, while representatives of the Chicago
and Alton, notably Vice- President and
Ganeral Manager Chappel.said they did not
seÂ« how rate wars c^uld be prevented. Mr.
Chnppei addea: "1 think all iratlic asso
ciations will have to go by the board.
From a railroad standpoint I think the
decision is all wrong. It was rendered
without expert opinion." â¢
Vice-President and General Manager
Truesdale of tie Rook Island said the
company would probably withdraw from
ail associations.
Vice- President Mortoo of the Santa Fe
said: "ido noi believe railroads will cut
each other's tnroats during this emer
eency. We look for relief from Congreis,
but to be on the safe side we annulled our
membership."
The consensus of opinion is that a
period of widespread and disastrous rate
disturbances is at hand, because each road
can now do M it pleases and cut ra.es
openly and secretly, regardless of the in
terstate commerce law. Railroad men
and shippsrs agree that such conditions
will work injury to the geueral public,
giving bis shippers and merchants who
get lowest rates an advantage over com
petitors.
Railroad officials here were paralyzed
by the decision and little business was
done. All of them were busy ditxussing
the effect, of the opinion and speculating
on the future. The officers of the associa
tions were most deeply concerned.
At the headquarters of the Western
Freigut Ass< c ation the Board of Admin
istration did nothing, although it has
been i:i daily session for weeks and an im
portant meeting on the division of traffic
was called for to-day.
Chairman Donald of the Central Pas
senger Association changed the opinion
he gave yesterday, admitting the decision
affected passenger associations.
Commissioner Tucker of the Central
Freight Association consoled himself with
the opinion that the decision would not
stand the combined attack of railroads.
Chicago officials believe it would be un
wise and useless to crfmbat the decision
and that their prompt compliance will
help the passage of laws regulating trans
portation companies, especially the Pat
terson pooling bill now pending.
It is the general opinion that differen
tials, which are an agreed lower tariff
division on certain roads at a disadvan
tage by a competitor, will hare to be
atolished. Some of them hr.ye been in
force twenty years and have an important
bearing on competition between rail and
water routes from Chicago eastward.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Maich 23. â
Chauncer M. Denew, Tvho is chairman
of 'he board of control of the Joint
Traffic Association, said to-day that there
was no doubt that the decision of the
Supreme Court in relation to the illegality
of the Trans-Missouri Traffic Association,
and which was interpreted as applying to
all traffic associations, was of serious mo
ment. He added that he could not talk
intelligently upon the situation, however,
as be Intel not yet been furnished with the
full text of the decision, and until he
learned its precise specifications, he
would have to refrain from talking. Ho
was inclined to the belief, however, that
(he decision did not cover the Joiut
Traffic Association, or if it did that it
opened up a new course of action and that
euch individual association upon the con
ditions of its organization would have to
have a Â«cperate hearing.
Mr. Depew then went on to explain that
the articUs of the Joint Traffic A socia
tion were drawn ur withÂ»the most minute
care. They were prepared carefully by
the ablest lawyers in the country, and
nothing was dene hastily, and that they
were passed upon by the foremost rail
road men in the country, the shrewde-t
and brichtest lawyers and amended so
that there was not a flaw where they
might conflict with the Government.
Even the care of a test case was resorted
to.
He would not say, on account of not
having the full text of the decision, what
action, if miy, would be taken by the
Joint Traffic Association and would have
to wait until the decision was made clear
before explaining the Joint Traffic Asso
ciation's position in the light of this
decision.

STOCKTON, Cal., March 23.â For weeks

CUBAN PATRIOTS
GAIN VICTORIES
They Attack and Capture
the Town of Cano,
Near Havana.
Guerrillas Sent Out by Weyler
to Murder the Innocent
Also Suffer.
Shocking Cruelties on the Part of
the Spanish Forces Are
Daily R: ported-
NEW YORK, N. V., March 23.â A spe
cial dispatch to the Sun from Havana
says: The town of Cano, near Havana,
has been attacked by the insurgents and
captured after a hot engagement with tne
garrison. The insurgents ransacked many
stores and supplied themselves with a
large stock of armÂ«, ammunition, cloth
ing, medicines and money. After an
hour in town they again retired to the
country.
Oaa of the stores ransacked belonged to
a Cuban named Gomez, who was a rich
erocer and a strong partisan of the
Spaniards. The insurgents punished him
by taking away all the cash they found in
his store, over $3000 in cold, and all the
merchandise, worth $7000 more. Sjrrip
ping the man, they obliged him to set out
barefooted for Havana.
Near the same place the Spanish guer
rilla of La Media Luna was surrounded by
the insurgents, who killed all the Cubans,
most of them colored men from Havana,
who belonged to it. Captain Gmterrez,
leader of the guerrillas, was also killed.
The men of the Media Luna were noted
for their cruelty to women, children and
Generally to non-com ba tan ts.Tnose among
them who were whites of Spanish birth
were released, after promising that they
would never again take up arms against
the independence of Cuba.
From Puerto Pancipe comes the news
that another leader of a Spanish guerrilla
force, the famous Captain Rodjas, was
killed in a recent engagement with the
revolutionists.
He was marching a few days ago with
his men at the head of the column of
General Jiminez Castelinnos when the
latter attempted to capture the Cuban
Government at San Jeronimo. Rodjas
nsi recognized by the Cubans who met
the column, surrounded by them and torn
to pieces, with forty-three of hi* followers.
An awful report comes from Saucti
Spiritus, which if coniirmed will make one
of the darkest pages in the history of the
Cuban war. The Cubans affirm that
Senora Josefa Canizares, mother of the
Secretary of the Interior in the Cuban
Government, Santiago Garcia Canizares,
was tortured by the Spaniards and burned
to death. The Spanish official report of
the affair i 3 that her death was purely
accidental, Senora Canizares having been
burned wlr.le lighting a lamp, which fell
on her dress.
A speciul to the Times from Tampa,
Fla., says: The passengers on the Oli
vette last night told a story of the hor
rible murder committed in Pinar del Rio
province last night, near Artemisa, of the
family of Captain Luis Perez, a Cuban
loader, by the Spanish guerrillas.
His wife, three sisters and five children
were killed in cold blood. They were
living some distance from town, when
this band approached. The women hid
and refused to open the doors when the
guerrillas demanded entrance. They
forced the doors with their muskets and
soon found the poor women.
Mrs. Perez was found in one room, hid
den with the children behind a bed. The
guerrillas raised their matchetes to kill
them. The mother threw up her arm?,
{â leading for mercy. They told her that
she must die. She then pleaded for the
live>( of her children, but tor answer she
received a saber gash that split her head
open, (scattering her brains and blood
upon the helpless infant she held in her
arms. Four other children were slaugh
tered.
The guerrillas then pillaged thÂ« prem
ises. They found the two sisters and en
deavored to extort confession? of rebel
plots from them. When they found that
nothing could be learned the women were
subjected to the grossest indignities and
afterward murdered. Not yet satisfied,
the band went through the house and
plundered it thoronghly, and took every
thing they could find.
Juan Perez, an aitcd relative of the fam
ily, had crept up into the loft of the old
fashioned country house, where he was a
silent witness to all that took place. AS
soon as the murderers had gone be fled to
the camp of the insurgents and told them
the story.

'j - ..â  : ."->;â . Lnmie.'t Men. .-.:. Â»:.:<f.;i^ : '.
; BALTIMORE. Md., - March 23.â The
case against General Roloff, Cuban Secre
tary of ? War, -and l)r. Jose J. Luis, for
alleged nlibustering!; was begun before
Judge Morris in the United States District
Court (o-day. Roloff failed to appear. '-y;.' '"_â 
Captain Hudson of the steamer Woodall
detailed the negotiations entered into at
New York by Roloff, Luis and himself for
the power of chartering a vessel for fili
bustering purposes. He and Roloff came
to Baltimore and bought the Woodall.
After the purchase money bad been paid
the captain stated that they took in pro
visions enough to feed 100 men for a
month, although his crew comprised only
fifteen men. He sailed from Baltimore
July 9, 1895, Roioff and Luis being aboard
and shipping as a part of the crew.
The vessel was hove to off Harbor Key,
Fla., and several small boats approached.
The Woodall took on board from these
vessels 153 men, most of whom were
dressed in the uniform of Cuban insur
gents. A lot of arms were put aboard, in
cluding rifles and macnetes, as was also
600 pounds of dynamite and a lot of dyna
mite caps. Four days after leaving the
iceys the Woodall landed the party and
her cargo on the Santa Clara coast of
Cuba.
Captain Hudson detailed the more
rue nts of the Woodall subsequent to the
landing of the expedition. He proceeded
to Progresso, Yucatan, and sailed thence
for New Orh-ans. arriving at the latter
port Anjrust 4. 1895. He found instruc
tions waiting him to turn the Teasel over
to a Mr. White, who took charge and paid
off and discharged the crew and gave
Hudson $500 extra as gratification money.
Ac cord in? to bis agreement with the
Junta the Woodall was to be given to
Hudson provided be til successful ia
landing the initial and two or three sub
sequent expeditions. As further reward
for ais loyal services he was to be made a
commodore if Cuba ever had a navy. He
finally relinquished his claim for the
Woodall, and she was taken to New York
and sold for $15,000.
The trial will be continued to-morrow.

TACOMA'S DREDGER CASE.
Judge Hanford's Comments in Granting
an li junction to the Bowers
Company.
TACOMA, Wash., March 23.â Judge
Hanford to-day forwarded from ' Seattle a
written opinion in the Bowers Dredger
Company injunction suit against the New
York Dredging Company et al. The
opinion is not as strongly favorable to
Bowers as was the verbal intimation from
the bench. \Vbile granting a temporary
injunction until the trial, upon the
streneth of a decision of the Circuit Court
of Appeals in the Yon Schmidt case, he
does not consider himself bound by it on
tbe trial. Afler referring at some length
to the claim of the defendants, that their
excavator is constructed upon principles
known long prior to Bowers' invention,
he says :
"Here I find the greatest difficulty in
the way of a satisfactory decision. The
authorities support the rule contended for
by the deiendants that to warrant the
granting of a provisional injunction in
fringement must be proven beyond a
doubt. Now lam not willing to be con
vinced oi any material fnct in the case
beyond a reasonable doubt until tbe final
hearing and full consideration of tbe
proofs which may be taken according to
mdthodd best calculated to elicit the
truth." â¢
After referring to tbe fact that while do
serious loss is likely to accrue to the
plaintiff if tbe New York Dredging Com
pany is permitted to complete its Everett
and Swinomish slough contracts on its
giving indemnity bonds, yet tbe plaintiff
might suffer irreparable damage if tbe
defendant were allowed to bid in competi
tion for other work and be permitted to use
the dredger Oakland for such competition,
he decides that the New York Dredging
Company may complete tbe present con
tract on civing a $5000 bond, out is other
wise forbidden to use tbe dredger. That
he leans at present to the side of Bowers
is, however, indicated by his saying in
one part of tlie opinion :
"in co aparina the different machines,
it is very difficult for me to find an in
fringement in theVon Schmidt machine
and not in the dr#aeer Oakland," yet he
admits being impressed by the contention
of the defendant's counsel that tne validity
of the New York company's claim was not
fully tested in the Yon Schmidt caÂ«e, and
the further contention that the Bowers
patent was vo d because anticipated by
English patents ot long prior date. Upon
this he says:
"Upon final hearing I will make an
analysis of patents in the suit and the
necessary comparisons with the several
devices described in tbe patents and pub
lications which are supposed to be antici
pations; but I am not called upon to do
so at the present time."
The prices of drugs are fixed by law in

SAN JOSE, Cal., March 23.â An inqnest
over the body of Henry Bottscher, the
young man who committed suicide last

despondent over his inability to obtain
work. He had been employed as a clerk
in a grocery at the corner ul Mission and
Twelfth streets, in San Francisco, up to
about two months ago, when he lost his
position. He came to this city yesterday
forenoon and went to the home of his
brother-in-law, J. D. Husing, on L.i<Â»k ave

native of Germany and aged 21 years.

For the Gallows.
Lires of Sheriff Chavez's Slayers
Spared Until the President Can
Investigate.
BAHTA FE. N. M.. March 23.â Active
preparations for the execution of the Bor
rego gang of murderers were in progress
here this morning when at 9:30 o'clock a
telegram came from Washington sent by
Attorney-General McKenna to Governor
Thornton stating that a reprieve of ten
aays had been granted by the President.
The dispatch stated that the action was
made necessary by the press of business,
which had prevented the President from
g.ving the case the necessary considera
tion. Governor Tnornton was requested
to grant a similar respite. This was done,
although the Governor contends that the
President has no authority to interfere.
Superintendent Bergeman of the peni
tentiary had the four condemned men out
in front of the cell-house awaiting the ar
rival of Sheriff Kinseli, who wes then ap
proaching, accompanied by his guards
and a detail of Territorial cavalry, when
the news of the reprieve was telephoned
by the Governor to Colonel Bergeman.
Colonel Bergemaa notified the Sheriff in
the presence of the prisoners of what had
happened.
The condemned men received the news
with shouts of joy. Frank Borrego said
he was sure that it would come. He had
dreamed that a reprieve wouid reach here
before they put foot on the waiting pai
iows, and in a published interview he said
he desired to thank his attorneys, Catrou
and Spiess, and also Colonel Max Frost,
for their earnest efforts :o save him. As
to whether they were guilty or innocent
of the assassination of ex-Sheriff Chavez
Borrago said he had promised his Savior
he would tiave nothing to say.
Antonio Borrego said : "Mr. Citron has
saved us before and he can do so again."
Antonio said :.e was not guilty.
Sheriff Kiusell requested that the prison
ers be taken back to their cells, but the
superintendent said they should not, un
less the Sheriff would stand personally
respousiue for their keep at the peniten
tiary. Ha said he had not been paid by
the county ior the safe keeping of the
prisoners for the past year, and he had
Dad annoyance enough witbthem; so the
Sheriff very reiuciantly took toe men ia
charge and conveyed them ia a carriage
to the county jail, a ranisasekie adobe
structure, which is deemed any tiring but
secure for tha conrinemea: oi prisoners.
An extra guard has been put on, but no
one f^els that the convicts are saie from
escape or rescue.
Tne general sentiment here is very
different on the subject of this second
reprieve from what ie was when .Mr.
C.eveland gave them a thirty .days*
respite. The impression pre rails that
President McKiniey will look per
sonally into the case as soon as pressure
of public business wiil permit, and th*t
after cons.dering the questiou of juris
diction and its merits he wiil decide 10 let
the law take its coarse, as did Mr.
Cleveland.
The United States Supreme Court hav
ing decuieck that the trial of the Borregos
in the New Mexico courts was < perfectly
regular and could not be appealed to that
tribunal, the main question now is: Is
the crime of murder committed in any. of
the Territories an . "offense aeainst the
United States," within the meaning of
that provision of the constitution which
gives the President jurisdiction "to grant
pardons or commutation ot sentence? '
Mr. Catron, attorney for the Borregos,
contends that it is and relies on a murder
c*se from S&nta Fe County, in whicn
President Artnur, by. advice'of Attorney-
General Brewster, sixt.esn years aeo, is
sued a proclamation commutine the sen
tence of E. C. Kelly from death to iife im
prisonment. District Attorney Crest, who
is in Washington representing tee Terri
tory in this case," contends that Congress
has vested in the Terruonal Governor the
only authority in tbe premises and cites
ex-PrÂ«sident Cleveland's recent order in
tnis matter to sustain his position.
The credit for obtaining these Presiden
tial reprieve? iÂ« aitr.buted here to Arcn
bishop Cbappelie, who ha? just returnea
after a hasty trip to Washington. It is
also alleged that tnroaeh ihe Archbishop
Cardinal Gibbons aud Aichbisnop Ireland
xrere induced to interest Oiemss.res ia the
case, the latter having visited Washington
yesterday partly on tbls mission, it is aaid.
Naturally ranch criticism of the .Area
bishop's conduct is indulged in by officials
here, and even by some of his parishion
ers; but, on tha other hand, it is con
tended that by sucn investigation as the
President will now have time to make all
taint ot political persecution wili be re
moved from the case.

ALREADY WEARY
OF OCEAN LIFE
Twenty BoysD9sert From
the Apprentice Ship
Adams.
Rigid Discipline of the Navy
Discourages the Young
Seamen.
Reward of Ten Dollars Off red fcr
the Capture of Each of the
Fugitives.
SAN DIEGO, Cal.. March 23.â When
tne United States gunboat Adams arrived
in port on sunaay morning it had 100
naval apprentice boys, between the ages
of 14 and 18 years, aboard, all apparently
in good health and spirits. When the
roll was called this morning but eighty
four answered "here." At "taps" to-night
four v worn were missing, so twenty of
those boys are no longer in the United
States nary.
On Sunday night a number of the boys
were allowed shore liberty and failed to
return. Last evening a. visiting party of
officers was made up, in response to an
invitation from officers on the Monterey.
Eleven apprentice boys were taken along
toman their launch. On the way over a
stop was made at the Santa Fe wharf for
the mall. - Thoughtlessly one by one the
officers left the launch and strolled about
the wharf, waitine for tbeir mail. When
they returned the launch was deserted.
Every boy had taken the first opportunity
to "skip," and the balance of the voyage
had to be made without a crew. A search
was instituted, but without avail, end the 1
usual reward of $10 a head is now offered
for the younesters' return aboard ship.
An officer who was seen ashore this morn
ine expressed grave doubts as to whether
they would ever be captured.
"What is the reason the boys desert?"
he was asked. ''Don't they get enough to
eat?"
"That's not it," replied the officer. "It
is really all a question of "principle.
The navy is not tne best place for boys/
no, indeed. In the first place it destroys
home and home" influences, the society of
mother, suter, eirl playmates, youthful
sweethearts and all the little influences
that surround the borne and neighbor
boodâmany of them foolish, oerbaps. but
sweet and never-to-be-forgotten for all
that. Some of the boys are sent into the
aavy to reform them. _ But it is a poor re- i
form school that simply disciplines ana
teaches nothing higher in lire than obedi
mce to orders. Asrsin, some parents put
:heir boys into the navy to get rid of
:hem. Such poor lads are undoubtedly
setter of! aboarJ ship than on land, ibr

Tnomas Hill, the artist of Yoseraite,

main there during the summer.
His left arm, wmch received a paralytic
shock some n.ontns ago, is now nearly
well, but he says be has not bandied a
brush since the attack. He thinks, how
ever. that he can iesume work when he
gets to Wanons.
One great regret, he says, is that he is
not able to go to the Kings Kiver Canyon
and rough it. lie regard* that as a new
and strange Yosemite, and thinks the
gigantic cliffs, deep gorges, queer moun
tains and great trees of the new National
park a great field for a young and energetic

In his judgment they are suggestive of
one of tne most cuarniine of countries for
painters and other lovers of nature.
"it is now not difficult to get into tne
canyon by sad<lle mule," said Mr. Hill.
The trails* are well beaten. It, however,
requires about 100 miles of stsg-.ns and
riding before the edge of tbe park is
reached.

JUROR MILSAP

When His Appetite Gnawed

Verdict.
Came Into Court Next Day aod
Announced a Change of
Opinion.
Que?r Complications in a Damage
Suit Tried in a Los Angles
Court.
LOS AXGELES, Cal., March 23.â An
anbeard ol circumstance in the Superior
Court here to-day produced a genuine sen
sation. The flurry among the attorneys
for the plaintiff in an action for heavy
damages was caused by a juror changing
his mind after agreeing upon a verdict in
favor of said plaintiff and then voting in
open court against his own decree and
that of his associates. A bare "quorum"
had agreed upon the verdict, and there
fore the action of Juror Milsap in 7oting
"no" on the call of his name to sustain the
verdict kills it and makes it necessary to
try the case over again.
The case was one brought aeainst the
Los Angeles Traction Street Railway Com
pany by the guardian of an incompetent,
Frank Abrahams. The verdict was formu
lated and sealed yesterday. Tais morn
ine, when the jury was asked if it bad
agreed upon a verdict. Foreman Butler
said it bad and read the following:
"We, the jury in the above-entitled ac
tion, rind for the plaintiff, and fix dam
ages iv tne sum of |4200."
The sensation of the day soon followed.
Juror Milsap, when his name was called
in tne poli, promptly voted "no" along
with three others who had been against
tbe findings all along. The court an
nounced that he would have an investiga
tion, and the case may go before the
Grand Jury. The only explanation of
Milsap's strange conduct is that he was
anxious to go to his supper last night and
voted with the majority to hasten an ad
journment.

The attorney finally broached the subject

Red Buff, the Ccunty Seat, One of
Northern California's Most Pros
perous Cities.
RED BLUFF, Cal., March 21.â One of
the most productive counties in the State,
and one whose resonrses are most abund
ant and diversified, is Tchama. Its west
ern boundary is the summit of the Coast
Range, and its eastern the summit of the
Sierras, on the sides of which are im
mense tmher forests. While the valleys
and foo I . hills are covered with orchards
Â»nd vineyards, whoso product brings
great revenue to the county, there are yet
mnny thousands of acres grown to grain.
On the southern boundary line, east of
the Sacramento River, is situated the
famous Stanford vineyard and winery,
where thousands of gallons of the purest
of distilled and fermented juices from tbe
grape are each year placed on the market.
in that Immediate vicinity are orchards
from which more than 100 carloads of
dried peaches are shipped every year, be
lles many hundreds in the fresh slate.
J.osesamc orchards bring thousands of
]A< liars to their owners as returns for the
apricots, prunes, apples, pears, nectarines
and other fruits which they yield. But
not that immediate portion of the county
alone is adapted to frait. On the con
trary, from the foothills on the west, both
in the northern and southern portions of
the county, to ihe foothills in the eastern
portion, ire found many profitable or
chards, which are successfully farmed by
their owners, the natural result of which
is a happy a-nd contented people.
Several of these orchards contain from
100 to 300 acres each, while the little tracts
devoted to horticulture, comprising from
five to ten acres each, number hundreds.
And in their midst is the only colony tract
that has done anythine In the way of gen
erally advertising Northern California in
recent years â the Maywood Colony, at
Conking, which has advertising literature
scattered through every region of the
United States and which owns a hundred
or more separate iruit farms.
Away to the east, near to the pine tim
ber, and skirting the Shasta line, is the
Man ton cpuntry. To get therÂ» one must
cross a few miles of as rough and uninvit
ing a bed of lava as is to be found in the
State; but rvhen he reaches that settle
ment, one surprise follows another. On
every hand are seen orchards whose
growth and productiveness will astonish
the tourist from the best known f:uit re
gions of the State. Only a few years aeo
it was thought that beans alone were the
profitable crop of that section of the
county, yet to-day its beans are unheard
of because of the fame of its fruit, though
.t produces more of the "Boston straw-
Â« l>erry" than ii ever did before. The road
hither is now being macadamized, and it
â¢vil\ soon be a delightlul drive, instead of
a rough trail.
Many thousands of dollars worth of
wool is prodnce-i in Teharna County, and
many more thousands of dollars' worth is
marketed at Red Bluff every year. In fact
the wool marktted here cuts such a large
figure in the San Francisco market that it
is quoted by itself as "Red Bluff wool."
Xehmna County is a sportsman's para
disc. Deer are found in plenty, and some
bear are in the Coast Range to tempt tbe
hunter, while the hills and valleys are full
of quail, and the streams are well stocked
witu fish. Through the efforts of Attorney
John J. Wells, Antelope Creek (wliich had
been partly rislied out) was restocked with
trout in 1895 and Battle Creek in 189 G.
Many pans of Battle Crock, however,_
needed nothing more to make It one of
the best trout streams in the State. At
its mouth is situated a larze salmon hatch
ery, erected by the State in 1895, and also
the larrpst hatchery in the world, erected
by the United States Government in 1896,
at which nearly 30,000,000 eggs were taken
the first season.
The county-seat of Tehama County is
the town of Red Bluff, situated on the
west bank of the Sacramento River, a cool
and placid stream. In its waters abound
fish of many varieties and in great quan
tities, and as a means ot transportation it
has been much more successful in regu
lating freight rates than hai ever been any
It lilroad Commission. Regular steamers
make weekly trips from Sacramento to
thi3 point, and they come well laden not
only with goods for Red Bluff merchants,
but witii good-sized cargoes consign d t^>
merchants in the northeastern portion of
the State and Southern Or<gon. All of
this freight formerly went to Keddintr by
rail, but after the opening of tiie river to
navigation by the United States Govern
ment a lew years aco (through tne efforts
ot Congrps men Geary and Caminetti)
Rfld Bluff became the great entrepot of
the north. The Supervisors wisely under
took the imiTOVprnent of the roads from
R'-d Bluff to the Shasta County line, and
now the heaviest of loads can be
transported over them with ea^e. This
makes the trip from the country to the
northeast a little longer than it i* to Red
ding, but the advantage Re 4 Bluff has in
the matter of freight rates more than over
comes the difference in time required for
the nig teams to make a round trip.
The streets in Red Bluff are wide, and.
although they do not appear so crowded
as would narrower ones and thus do not
SCENES IN RED BLUFF AND VICINITY.
f present such a bustling appearance as
they might anrl as the amount of traffic
on them would indicate they MioulJ, they
are a joy and pride to the residents and to
the transient public. All are well graded
and free from dust and the residence por-
I tion of the town is one of the piettiest to
be found anywhere. Though it has been
9aid that it takes a hilly country to make
a pretty town, lied Bluff traverses and de
niss that such is the case, and points to
herself to illustrate 'the position that a
beautiful city can bo built on tbe plain.
In nearly every yard are two or more
orange trees, wbich through the fall and
winter dazzle all with tneir beautifully
colored fruit, which grows here to perfec
tion, though, strange to say, none have
yet planted orange proves for commercial
purposes, except one belonging to D. S.
Cone. The foliage of a few lemon and
olive trees is also to be seen, and they
produce good crops every year, the olives
in this locality being very prolific.
TheÂ» tDwn just now mourns the comine
departure of her most distiuguishad citi
zen, General N. P. Chipman, who will
soon remove to San Francisco to assume a
place on the Supreme Court Commission.
In all affairs pertaining to Northern Cali
fornia and especially to the fruit industry
General Chipman's name has become a
household word. But aside from his ef
forts in these lines he has devoted tbe
most of his time to the practice of his
profession, and has iong been one of the
leading lawyers of the north. He will bo
succeeded in his practice by John J.
Wells, who has been his confidential
clerk for many years. He is a young
man who has given evidence of bfing well
adapted to the profession he has chosen.
The Sierra Lumber Company, of which
Hon. i'et.er l>ean, president of the Mer
chants' Exchange Bank of San Francisco,
is president and general manager, has its
prinripal worrs at Red Bluff, just across
the river from the town. The institution
gives employment to several hundred
hands. Their product is shipped largely
to Australia, besides the California cus
tom.
There is one thing noticeable about the
town, and that is the concentration of its
business into one locality. Unlike most
phices it is not spread out over several
streets, but not a business house is to be
found off vVasnut or Main streets. Wal

the town from the west, past the railroad

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 24, 1897.
Kimball Company. The upper story of
ihe building is fitted up for lodging pur
poses and for offices, while the company
occupies nearly the entire lower floor antf
a large cellar. It has in addition a large
warehouse in wi.ich it keeps the heavier
port ion of its goods and wares. Major G.
G. Kimball, the president of the company,
and D. W. Gedney, its secretary, are men
known far and wide for their business
ability and integrity, They do not only a
large retail business, but are wholesalers
and jobbers of no mean note, and every
boat brintrs to them large consign
ments of goods, in car lots. There you
can buy anything from a sewing needle,
a bit of cheese or a yard of calico, to a
combined harvester or a complete stock
of general merchandise fjr a country
store. They handle many thousands of
dollars' worth of dried iruit, nuts and
raisins every year.
Immediately south of the Cone & Kim
bali store is the place whither one always
goes to find the man he is looking for. It
is the spacious walk in front of the Tre
mont Hotel. This is a building that
would be an ornament to a town of 20,000
people. On its site formerly stood a
weil-known hostelry of iho same
name, but on a fatal night in 1891 it fell a
victim to the dreaded enemy â fire. On
the ruin? of the old building was erected
the present structure, and on January 1,
1895, S. E. Murphy opened it to the pub
lic. While the old "building was roomy
and pleasing to the eye, its memory is
now a nightmare compared to th? present
building. Broad and winding stairs lead
to the second and third stories, where
comfortable rooms are found, equipped
with all the latest improvements to make
life in a hotel more pleasant than in a
private home. And for fear some one
will imagine that home life is to be pre
ferred, Mr. Murphy keens at command
for the table all the delicacies to be had
in either local or San Francisco markets.
Another one of Red Bluff's industries
of which sbe is mo^ proud is the can
nery, where hundreds are employed
throughout the fruit season. The label ot
the Red Bluff Canning and Packing Com
pany has come to be recognized in several
Eastern markets as a standard of purity,
for the company packs no inferior goods.
In 1892 the farmers and business men
erected a small cannery, not with any ex
pectation that it would ever be anything
more. But they secured for manager one
of the most experienced canners and best
business men in the State, James Feeley,
iong associated with the J. Lusk Com
pany, of San Francisco. Alter managing
the business for the company for two
years Mr. Feeley and George H. Kraft
bought up most of the shares cf stock in
the company and proceeded to enlarge the
plant. They have made several additions
to it, and to-day it is one of the largest in
the State.
Not content with the cannery business
alone, that only taking their time for a
portion of the year, Mr. Feeley and Mr.
Kraft ventured into the buying and ship
ping of dried fruit to the Eastern markets.
They were so successful in that Jine that
it became necessary to enlarge the scope
ot the old cannery -company or to create a
new corporation. This latter they did,
and a few wee us ago incorporated under
the name of the James Feeley Company.
They will soon erect a scouring plant for
wool at Red Bluff.
Another industry with headquarters at
Red Bluff that gives employment to a
large number of men is the Holt & Gregg
Company. Tney have large lime kilns
and brickyards in Shasta County, and are
interested in nearly every large contract
tor brickwork from the Oregon line to far
south of Red Bluff.
The healthful ness of Red Bluff as a place
of residence is attesed by the reports of
the State Board of Health. But it a man
feels at ' all run down and needs a
little change, all he has to do is to take a
drive or get into Walbridge's conveyance
and be driven about nine miles northeast
of Red Bluff. Here are the famous Tuscan
Sprine-", owned by E. B. Walbridge, with
postoffice and telegraph and telephone
connection with the outside world. There
are about fifty springs in all, and their
medicinal quatitles are as varied as are
the number of springs. Their best adver
tisement is the thousands who have been
treated in the waters. For rheumatism
and as blood purifiers they have no equal
on the coast. In fact, many patients have
been cured here aftÂ»r trying without avail
the waters of celebrated Eastern as well as
coast springs. Treatment there for kid
ney, liver and skin diseases has been so
successful that many who have been
treated for years by tbe best physicians of
the coast have gone borne cured. A com
munication addressed to E. B. Walbridge,
Tuscan. Tehama County, Cal., will bring
one a pamphlet giving full particulars re

springs.
In September, 1895, Red Bluff lost one
of her wealthiest citizens, Hon. J. 8. Cone,
and the management of his business was
left to bis eldest child and only son,
Douglas S. Cone. He took bold of the
business right where taia father left off.
and managed it with such success and
with so much ability as to astonish all
during the administration of the estate.
When the property wax distributed to the
heirs tbe homo ranch, situated about four
miles southeast of Red Bluff, feil as a part
ot his share to him. Included thereon are
several.of the most profitable orchards in
the county, one pear orchard alone pro
ducing fifty carloads in a single season.
He is one ot the lareest producers of wool
in the county, his flocks ranging in the
hilis east of the borne place, end he
naturally takes an active interest in every
thing done to advance the sheep interest,
his clip being of the finest. Besides look
ing after every detail of his sheep inter
ests, he gives careful attention to his
farming operations; has several thousand
acres in grain and hundreds of acres of
alfalfa, which he converts into beef. He
is an open-hande i, generous young man,
devoted to all ontside sports, and a great
favorite in society. A brilliant future is
predicted for him. He is. also a large
stockholder in the Cone & Kimball Com
pany, the B:mk of Tebama County and ia
the Red Buff Electric Li;ht Company.
Tbe electric iiglit company, of which
W. Runyon is president, receives its
power from the waters of Antelope Creek,
on the lands of Mr. Cone. Wires run from
there to Red Biuff and the town is fav
ored with the best and most steady of
electric lights at nominal cost. All of the
business houses are lit with either arc or
incandescent lights and the streets are
dotted with arcs of 1200-candle nower â
all from the sa.-ne source. The manager,
John Clements, is an active worker,
as is the president, Mr. Rnnyon, in all
nffairs of public interest. Mr. Runyon is
also president of the Bank of Tebama
County, being one of the youngest bank
presidents in the State, and also one of the
most popular. It is gratifying to seethe
large number of tourists and Eastern peo
ole visiting Red Bluff this spring.

REACHING FOR A
USURER'S GOLD
A Suit That May Break
Asa Fisk's * Last '*â  â 
Will.
Child aby the First Wife Make
Djmands for Their
Shares. :
The Escapades of the Money-L ndrr
Exposed in an Action by the
, Elder Son.
The will of the Jate Asa fisk, the suc
cessful {money-lender, is to be contested.
From jin action in equity, tiled yesterday
in the United States Circuit Court, it is
believed that the contest will be bitter,
spirited, and even sensational.
Those who unfortunately were obliged
to borrow money from the capitalist little
realized that back in the life of the capital
ist there was a romance, the aftermath of
which must no doubt have caused him
many a day and night of regret and
worry.
Asa Fisk in his earlier life was rather
popular with the fair sex, and his first
known conquest resulted in his marriage
with a Massachusetts girl. After three
children had blessed the union Fisk saw
and was smitten by the charms of another,
who completely won him from the side of
his lawful spouse and thair offspring.
As soon as Mrs. Fisk took in the situa
tion she made matters very tropical for
her recreant husband, who at that time
was well-to-do in the world's goods. She
undertook to get her pan of the com
munity property besides alimony. The
prospect of losing so much money caused
Fisk much annoyance, and he pleaded
that he might have the handling of what
would be two estates lor the benefit of
their children.
g
Â£
The mother relented and Fisk, witn his
latest conquest, started for California,
where he lived, grew richer on the neces
sities of others, an l died. He left a will,
in which h* bequeathed his estate as best
pleased hiinseit.
This did not please the elder son, Asa
Wellington Fisk, of Denver, Colo., for, as
stated, he yesterday brought action in the
United States Circuit Court against Lydia
B. Fisk, who is Mrs. Fisk No. 2, ana her
children by Fisk, Arthur G. Fist and
Flora Elina Wertheimer. His own
brother and sister, Thomas Holiis and
Parnella, are included to preserve the
legality of the complaint.
The complaint is particularly directed
against Mrs. Fisk No. 2 and her first
born, Arthur G. Fisk, the "pretended offi
cial executors of the last will and testa
ment of Asa Fisk."
The document is full of life and sensa
tional features, for it attacks the legitimacy
of the first-born of Mrs. Flsk No. 2 and it
i-< asserted that toe complainant seeks the
United States courts, as he fears that he
cannot secure the proper relief from the
State Probate Court.
The complaint charges that most all of
the estate of Asa Fisk before he made his
will was the estate and lawful earnings of
an estate held by the deceased in trust for
the complainant and his sister and
brother and not subject to devise and
deed by Fisfc, but, on the contrary, was
held by him solely to use, accumulate
from and finally at or before his death to
deliver to the children of the first wife or
to leave to them through a trustee so that
& legal title to the same nn.cn t pass to the
complainant and his brother and sister in
the following proportions: To Asa Wel
lington Fisk. the undivided three
sevenths; to Parnella -M. lloliis, the undi
vided one-seventh, and to Thomas H.
Fisk, the undivided three-sevenths.
The complaint explains the matter of
the trust by saying that it was created
and brought about between his mother
and the deceased Asa Fisk In considera
tion of forbearance and suspension of liti
gation existing between the mother and
father concerning the estate of the former
at the time they were living together.
An interesting feature showing the
skeleton in the Fisk closet is exposed in
the document, which poes on to say that
Asa Fisk, deceased, and Parnella Holiis,
mother of the complainant, were married
in 1843, and that "wnile husband and
wife, the deceased beenme attached to the
said Lydia B. Fisk, and meretricious rela
tions became established between said
Asa Fisk and said Lydia B. Fisk." While
that relationship was being carried on
Lvdin B. claimed that Asa Fisk was the
father of her unborn chiid, subsequently
Arthur G. Fisk. Mrs. Fisk No. 1 obtained
a divorce from Asa Fisk in Massachusetts,
and in their settlement it was agreed that
if the father should make suitable provi
sion for their children she would forego
permanent alimony and that further liti
gation for her rights should end simply
with the divorce.
He was also to give her $8000 in money,
and properly should be allotted to her ai
trustee for her three children, which sho
would advance to them by deed. Fisk
was to take the remainderof their joint
estate and the remainder of his individual
estate and place the same under his best
management and make itearn as much as
it might for the benefit of the three chil
dren.
Asa Fisk was evidently, for once, in a
position when he had to accept these
terms, and the mother fulfilled her part
of the agreement.
The complaint further states that but
for his mother making these terms with
his father, she might have continued the
litigation against nim to his financial un
doing. Hnd she not relied upon him keep
ing his word, she would have secured the
lion's share of the community property.
Tins agreement of term*, was made and
settled in 1869, and in that year Fisk went
to California, taking with him about
$25,000, which he united with a part o the
trust estate, which made a total of about
$75,030. A part of the trust estate he left
in Massachusetts. Later he married
Lydia B. Fisk.
In 1880 he made fulfillment of the trust
by signing a conveyance of the trust and
its obligations to Monroe Greenwood, now
deceased, who was made thereby the trus
tee for the complainant and his brother
and sister, to be held and managed by
Greenwood for them in this manner:
First, Asa Fisk wns to enjoy the same
during his life; second. Greenwood should,
at the demise of Ana Fisk, take control of
the estate and ascertain what was trust
estate and what was not and pay over one
half of the trust estate to Asa W., Thomas
H. and Parnella as follows: To Asa W.,
tnree-sevenths; to Thomas 8., three
sevenths, and to Parnella, one-seventh,
and invest the balance in Unitea States
Government bonds.
This agreement or deed of trust wis
made and signed in duplicate. Since the
death of Greenwood the deed of trust has
been mislaid, but its contents are well
known to the complainant. The latter
says that during ttie holding of the trust
estato Asa Fisk united the same with an
other estate and at present it cannot be
ascertained how much of the estate is
thus affected.
In conclusion, the complainant asks
that the Federal court take possession of
the estate and order the inspection of
Fisk's books, papers and accounts by the
Court Commissioner or other officials in
order that the two estates, the trust estate
and the other, may be separated.
This action promises to be filled with

FISK'S WILL CONTESTED.
Proceedings Begun In the Probate
Court of This City
Yesterday.
Asa W. Fisk has filed a contest to the
will of his father, the late Asa Fisk,
money-lender and successful usurer, who
left an estate worth $500,000.
In presenting his case tbe contestant
makes the same allegations regarding M>a.
Lyclia Fisk as are made in the case in tha
Federal courts.
The averment is also made that Asa
Fisk was menially unsound, that his
mind was weakened by being concen
trated on the subject of gain, that his
second wife exercised undue influence,
and that the paper riled for probate is not
in fact the last will or any will of said Asa
Fisk, deceased.
Under the pleadings in the ca?e it will
be competent to go into an inquiry con
cerning all the peculiarities and idiosyn
crasies of the dead money-lender. If the
trial goes on, a great many interesting
developments may be expected. The liti
gation will be long and expensive. If the
spirit of A?a Fisk is able to return and
w tness the way in which his estate i* to
be expended in tbe law courts, for the
winner must in the end pay from the
property recovered, there is reason to sup
pose that there will be at least one un
happy shade haunting the new City Hall
for the next ten years or so.

IKE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
WEDNhSDAY MARCH 24. 1897
Put up money for the boulevard.
Congress sees a surplus in sight.
It may be free Cuba sure enough before
the year close 3.
Of the minority report on the Dingley
tariff it may De truly said it is a platitude.
Ths agitation for the Federal building
will keep on until the building itself is
started.
The tariff debate is not drawing crowded
houses at Washington, but all the same it
tends to prosperity.
Let us promptly assure the completion
of the boulevard and then we can co for
ward to other things.
This kind of weather will put a fine
bloom on the coming- festivals and get
everybody ready to enjoy them.
The great powers are acting as agents
for the Su.tan, and will probably clean
him out before they get through.
The movement for a new constitution is
one in which we can afford to make haste
slowly. There is plenty of time.
The new tariff promises to yield a sur
plus of revenue, and accordingly we can
resume the good Republican policy of pay
ing off tho National debt.
The Democrats in Congress have re
sumed the wort of opposition in the old
way, and are once rnoie busiiy engaged
in denouncing the surplus.
The construction of the boulevard is the
most notable municipal enterprise now
before the t>eople, and everj prosperous
citizen should take pii ;e in assisting it.
Bryan's gift of onâ half the income from
his book to the B metallic Union sounds
liberal, but was probably intended only
as a contribution to a campaign iund for
his personal benefit.
The Democratic charge that the Dingley
tariff will rai^e an excessive revenue is
certainly one which was never made
against the Wilson lar ff, and to that ex
tent we have a new issue.
About the time the Eastern poet feels
inspired to sing, "Come, Gentle Spring,"
tl;e weather breaks loose with snowstorms,
floods and blizzards and the rapture of the
singer is frozen within him.
The letter which Blanther had mailed
from Atlanta to throw the police off the
track was one of the means by which he
was traced, and thus we have another evi
dence of the folly of letter-writing.
If the TJnited States should inquire the
cause of the blockade of Crete European
diplomatists would have so difficult a
conundrum to answer that they would
feel inclined to give up the whole thing.
Reports from Georeia show that the
Sunny South is as subject to cyclones as
any other part of the East; and onca
more the country is reminded that the
only place to fina a pacific climate is on
the Pacific Coast.
It is strange that a man of Blanther's
knowledge of the worid should have tried
to hide himself in a village where every
man is necessarily known to his neigh
bors. The only place where obscurity
can be found is a large city.
It is said that many Spaniards favor
the abandonment of further attempts to
conquer Cuba, provided Spain is paid an
indemnity for the island, and, perhaps,
peace may yet be arranged on those terms.
The indemnity, however, should not be
large. The possession which Spain has of
Cuba just now is not worth much of any
body's money.
The announcement from Washington
that the blockade of Crete is not likely to
affect our Government because we have
no merchant ships trading in that part of
the world may be comforting, but it i 3
not to our credit. Our merchant vessels
should be known in every quarter of the
globe and wherever we have commerce
our ships should be.
Americans imprisoned by Spanish au
thorities in Cuba are being rapidly re
leased, and before long all of them may
be free again. In fact with the incoming
of a new administration at Washington
General Weyler has adopted a new policy
at Havana and there is reason to believe
the occurrence of the two changes at the
same time is something more than a coin
cidence.
Tne banquet to be given to Senator
Morehouse by his constituents in San Jose
will be a well-deserved tribute to a legisla
tor whose services have been distinguished
by fidelity not only to his own district,
but to the whole State. It is altogether
right and fitting that some public testi
monial should be given of the esteem of
the people for such a representative, and
the banquet therefore will be a most ap
propriate one in every respect
The ceremonies at the celebration of
the centenary of the birth of William I
show an intent on the part of the Kaiser
to impress upon the German people that
his grandfather was the real founder of
the German empire and that Bismarck and
Yon Moltke were only subordinates. So
far ns monuments and imperial edicts can
go William I will be exalted as the great
est man of his time, but history, litera
ture and the traditions of the people will
tell another story.
A NEW CONSTITUTION.
Among the closing acts of the Legislature which has recently adjourned is to be
found a resolution submitting to the people of California the question whether they
desire a new State constitution ana will vote to call a convention for the purpose of
framing such constitution.
This is a subject so im portant to the Slate of California that neither its people nor
its newspapers should decide the question of its advisability without a most careful
delib?ration over its advisability at the present time. It is now nearly eighteen years
slnca the formation and adoption of our present constitution. It was born in a time
of great political and industrial unrest, and its framers atiempted to embrace within
it many innovations and changes in the then existing organic law of the State.
The result was a much longer constitution than the former one. The system ol
taxation was materially modified, the subject of railroads and of their regulation
occupied much space, the judicial system of the State was practically revolutionized,
as were also the rules affecting municipal charters and municipal law.
So extensive were the changes in our laws made by the conati'.ution of 1879 that it
was years before the people of California were brought by the decisions of its courts
to a reasonably clear understanding of their own organic law. In fact, there are yet
not a few provisions of our present constitution which are awaitine judicial construc
tion.
In Ihe meantime the constitution of 1879 has been amended in a number of im
portant particulars, and the process of amendment is still going on. Tne Legislature,
which has just adjourned, in addition to the resolution upon the subject of an en
tirely new constitution, has submitted to the people a number of very importani
amendments to tne present one.
In view cf these facts it is 8 very serious question whether the people of Califor
nia ought to enter upon so radical and expensive a proceeding as that attending the
formation of a new constitution. Upon this subject The Call will not attempt thus
early in its consideration to form or express an opinion.
It will, however, open its columns to the widest, the most careful and the most
intelligent discussion of the subject by the people of California and by those who are
best fitted to direct the public mind. As a result of the action of the Legislature
upon this subject it will certainly be submitted to the decision of our citizens at
the next general election. There will be ample time during the next year and a half
to discuss the subject fully.
The Call aims to excite and promote such public discussion of this important
issue from all points of view. When such a full consideration of the matter has
ripened into decision we shall endeavor to express not only the popular view of the
subject, bnt the true and practical wisdom which should guide the citizens of Cali
fornia in determining whether or not they will attempt the formation of a new con
stitution.
THE BOULEVARD.
The new boulevard, with its double pur
pose of relieving distress and adding a
fresh beauty to the City, is the most noted
municipal enterpris â¢ now going forward.
It is engaging the attention and receiving
the energetic support of some of our most
benevolent and public-spirited citizens. It
promises to be, in some measure at least,
a solution of one of the most difficult
problems of the ageâ that of the unem
ployed. It shows that by clear thinking
and energetic acting a charity may be
made profitable in a material as well as
spiritual sense.
Every prosperous citizen should con
tribute generously to the fund which has
been so kindly started. The plan of res
cue for the unfortunate men out of work
is now in full operation, and with results
so satisfactory no one need hesitate as to
its practical wisdom. That great impedi
ment to perfect enjoyment in every un
selfish man â the thought of unattended
suffering close at handâ is being in aiarne
measure removed, and a new attraction is
being added to the City which will add to
the material welfare of every one either
owning property or in -ny way earning
money here. Those already abundantly
rich will have a driveway which will
greatly add to their pleasure by increas
ing the variety of beautiful routes to
travel over.
The wors so well begun should bo per
sistently prosecuted till complete. To en
ter into a great undertaking like that and
then stop disheartened would be absurdly
weak and a groat mistake. The good ef
fect of what has already been done would
thus be greatly diminished, and those
who have done so commendably in ini
tiating the work would be much disheart
ened and lose the inspiration and energy
to help again in time of need.
Those w- o have boldly put their money
and time into the enterprise at the begin
ning from love of humanity and pride in
the City should not be forced to see their
efforts made futile for lack of enthusiastic
following. Many thousand dollars more
are required to finish the boulevard, and
many men are still in want and eager to
ret a chance to earn a dollar a day.
Therefore contributions should be made
promptly. To give quickly and gener
ously now to help the good cau^e along
will be a sort of striking whilÂ« the iron is
hot. To wait tilt the enthusiasm now
aroused is cooled and the immense potency
of wide co-operation can no loneer be
availed of will be to miss a very valuable
opportunity.
PROTECTION AND REVENUE.
No portion of the able address of Mr.
Dingley, In defense of the new tariff bill,
was more perfect in its logic or more
effective in its illustrations than that in
which he refuted the doctrine of the free
traders, that protection and revenue in
the same tariff schedule are impossible.
He contrasted the work in-? of the pro
tective wool and woolen duties of the
tariff of 1890 with the results of the non
protective duties on tne same articles in
the tariff of 1894, and thereby demon
strated the falsity of the free-trade con
tention.
The statistics given by Mr. Dingley are
interesting. The importation of cloth
ing wool In 1893, under the tariff of 1890,
was about 40,000,000 pounds and the man
ufactures of wool about 36.000,000. From
these importations in 1893 the Govern
ment derived a revenue of about $44,500,
--000. The importations of clothing wool
in the fiscal year 1896 exceed 127,000,000
pounds, and of manufactures of wool more
than twice ns many pounds in 1896 as in
1893, and yet the revenues derived by the
Government from this enormous increase
of the imports of wool and woolens in the
fiscal year 1896 was only $22.000,000â a loss
of $21,000,000 from that realized in 1893.
It will be seen from these statistics that
the protective duties not only provided
the Government with a revenue of $21,000,
--000 more than was raised by the free-trade
tariff, but furthermore saved for our
farmers a market for 80.000,000 pounds of
wool, as well as nearly 10 cents a pound
in the price. Thus, as Mr. Dingley de
clared, on this one schedule alone there
was a loss of revenue, a loss to farmers of
$30,000,000 a year, and a loss to the manu
factureis and workingmen of the country
of an even greater amount.
A study of this single illustration will
suffice to show the fallacy of the whole
Democratic argument that a protective
tariff cannot be a revenue tariff. If addi
tional illustrations were needed they
could be easily found by making other
contrasts between similar schedules in the
protective act of 1890 and the so-called
revenue act of 1894. Protection and reve
nue go hand in hand in the Dingley bill
as in that of 1890, and the people can look
forward, therefore, for a return to the
prosperity of the McKinley tariff period.
Victoria having now had the. longest
reign on record could well afford to abdi
cate, but sha is hardly likely to do so.
People of her age are easily persuaded
that the world cannot get along without
them and, besides, having reigned so long
a time, she may have a fancy to make it
longer still. Her abdication is, of course,
possible, but His not a safe th-ng to bet on.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. MARCH 24, 1897.
OUR MERCHANT MARINE.
It is reported from Washington that the
blockade of Crete gives but little concern
to our Government, by reason of the fact
that we haye no shipping in the Levant
to be affected by it. We have, therefore,
the satisfaction of knowing that we are
not likely to be involved in the contro
versy which now disturbs Europe, but the
satisfaction is largely diminished by the
nature of the conditions to which we owe
immunity. It is pleasant to be free from
foreign complications, but it is not pleas
ant to owe that freedom to the absence of
ships sufficient to carry on our commerce.
It is stated that so rare is the American
flag in Levantine waters that in 1896 only
one ship bearing the flag passed through
the Suez canal, and that was a warship.
In 1895 three vessels flying the stars and
stripes entered the canal, but one of them
was a jaan-of-war and the two others were
private yacnts. Merchant vessels of the
United Sates seem to be unknown in that
important trading center of the world.
The chances therefore of any American
ship being interfered with by the block
ade are slight, and our Government rests
easy at Washington by reason of the ab
sence of the American flag from that
quarter of the globe.
The incident is noteworthy only because
it calls attention once more to the decay
of American shipping and the extent, to
which our flag has passed from vhe ocean.
It is a familiar and an unpleasant toplr,
but it cannot be put aside. One of the
urgent necessities of the time is that of
building up our shipping industry and
expanding our commerce in foreign lands
through the medium of vessels construct-
Ed in the United States, manned by
American sailors and flying the American
flag. The possibility that some of these
ships might becoaie involved in diplo
matic complications would not disturb us
half so much as does tne fact that at
present we have to carry on our commerce
in foreign ships.
Fortunately the condition of our com
merce in the Mediterranean, as declared
by the reports of the absence of American
ships in the Levant, is not likely to con
tinue much longer. The present admin
istration is not only pledged by its plat
form to promote the ship-building indus
try of the country, but is known to be
earnestly in favor of talcing immediate
steps in that direction. As soon as the
tariff bill is enacted and the country pro
vided with a sufficient revenue to meet its
expenditures we may expect the atten
tion of the administration and of ConÂ«
gress to be turned promptly to considera
tions of the promotion of our merchant
marine. It will not be many years before
the American flag will be seen upon the
ocean wherever commerce is carried on,
and if we continue free from diplomatic
complications it will be for some other
reason than that of having no ships to be
affected by anything foreign nations may
do.
THE OLD OR?.
The report of the Democratic minority
of the Ways and Means Committee at
tacks the Dingley tariff bill mainly upon
the ground that it will entail excessive
taxation upon the people, raise a larger
revenue than the Government needs and
thus produce â a surplus. The report says :
An overflowing treasury is a constant temp
tation to enter upon expenditures that cor
rupt both the public miuU and the public's
servants. Under a system of high taxes thero
must bo a surplus or there must be waste, and!
both are serious evils. President Jaclcson
hardly overstated the danger of a surplus
when he stated that it was more dangerous
than a standing army; and yet, dangerous as
a surplus ie, it is not so dangerous as the ex
travagance which in always resorted to in or
der to prevent its accumulation.
It is not, however, against the surplus
only that the minority protests. Democ
racy still objects to protection as vehem
emiyasitdid before it had a chance to
try free trade. The report points out that
the bill is framed with the avowed pur
pose of protecting the manufactures of
the United States against foreign compe
tition, and goes on to say: "If it accom
plishes that purpose it must result in
compelling the consumers of this country
to pay more for their manufactured
goods." On that score, therefore, an well
as on that of causing a surplus the minor
ity protest. They are opposed to advanc
ing American industry, as well as to in
creasing the revenues of the country. This
is the substance of the whole long report,
and there is nothing in it of argument or
of style to give any additional effective
ness to the old objections of the free
traders.
Thus, after four years of deficit and dis
aster we return once more to the familiar
cry that protection to American industry
is a burden upon the people, and that a
surplus in the treasury is a public calam
ity. It is like the Cleveland campaign
against the McKmley bill all over again.
Times have changed, conditions have
changed, but Democracy i us not changed.
True to its Bourbon nature it has learned
nothing and forgotten nothing.
The country has had its lesson on Demo
cratic tariffs. It has learned by experi
ence what happens when there is no pro
tection for industry and no surplus in the
treasury. The people are aware that there
are worae things than these, and that
among them are revenue deficiency and
industrial disaster. Tne charge that the
Dingley bill will give us a surplus and
thorough protection will not arouse a cru
sade this time. The cry is as loud as ever,
but the people are wiser now.
KAISER WILLIAM.
It was a well-deserved honor tlie Ger
mans paid to their great Kaiser William
in celebrating the centenary of his birth
day. It was under him tnat Germany
was united into a powerful empire well
able to cope with any nation in Europe
in case of war and in the enterprises of
peace to rival great commercial and in
dustrial nations like England, which had
previously far outstripped the unconsoli
dated states.
The part which Bismarck and Yon
Moltke performed in this achievement
was so prominent as to link their names
inseparably with it, and to give them the
right to the title of creators of the empire,
but nevertheless they would have been
powerless to consummate that grand de
sign withont the aid of a king who pos
sessed another sort of greatness to make
a complement to theirs. It was the con
fidence the people reposed in their
Kaiser's magnanimity and the enthusi
astic patriotism his personality inspired
which formed the broad and solid founda
tion without which Bismarck would have
found it impossible to build the mighty
edifice of united Germany.
To be recrowned in this way is Indeed
one of the greatest honors. It proves
that he is still reigning over millions of
loyal hearts and that the scepter has not
passed Jrom bis grasp. He had tue test of
a great opportunity and he strongly and
nobly improved it. It is a great glory to
have been a King like the first Kaiser of
the united German empire, who builded
up the greatness of bis country, and the
people of Germany have good cause to
commemorate his personality as well as
his services in the council chamber and
the battle-field.

FORESTS AND FLOODS.
Chicago Times-Herald.
Every spring the people have an ODject les
son of the most serious and impressive kind
admonishing them of the wanton waste in the
past of the great fWcsts of the north. The
tudden freshets and floods that burst over the
banks of the rivers, carrying devastation and
death in their frightful progress are in a great
degree the result of the clearing away oi the
mountain forests and the breaking down of all
protection in m the water. Those immense
spaces covered with trees hold back the water
supplies and distribute them gent y and gmd
ually, thus permitting their most bountiful
uses. Remove the trees and the mountain
brooks and streams become torrents, and the
waters that would De a whole summer li nding
their way to the sea, carrying beneficence
with them, are dispersed in a few weeks, caus
ing the most fearful destruction.
With such lessons in plain view, two things
ought to be impressed on the people. One is
that the forests must be replaced as fast as de
stroyed and that no wanton havoc should be
made with the great forests that remain.

IN FAVOR OF THE
PENSION BILL
Teachers Express Their
Sentiments in the
Matter.
Big Meeting at the Rooms of
th 3 Board of Education
Yesterday.
Pedagogues From All of the Public
S:bools Appeal to the
Governor.
By a vote of 700 to 40 the public-school
teachers of San Francisco yesterday in
dorsed the pension bill recently passed by
both bouses of the Legislature, and now
in the hands of the Governor. The bill
measure contemplates the payment of the
pensions of broken-down and superannu
ated f teachers out of the public-school
funds instead of out of the pocsels of the
pedagogues by means of regular subÂ«
scriptions.
7 The principals of the schools were called
together by President Barrington of the
Board of Education, to gi re expression tt
the sentiments of the teachers in the mat
ter, tae Governor having been asKed tc

FROM AN EVANGEL
TO PLAIN TRADER
The John Wesley Has Seen
Many Changes in Her
Day.
Her Cabins Have Housed Canni
bals, but Now She Is a Sim
ple Merchantman.
Captain Frank Morlev Uader Arrest
for Violating the Washington
State Laws.
The smallest of vessels of her class tnat
has come into port in many a long day
is the little bark John Wesley. In her
young days one was under the British
flas, and for years sailed between Aus
tralian ports and the South Sea island
group as a tender to the missionaries of
the Methodist Church. A new boat was
built later and the John Wesley was sold
to a Norwegian syndicate. For nearly a
year she flew the Norwesrian flag, and
then sue was sold to the Jalniet Trading
Company, a German concern, which
placed her under the German flig. She
was sent up here for an overhauling, and
will go into commission again next month.
Since forsaking the missionary cause the
John Wesley does not seem to have played
in luck. On the way up the mate died be
fore the vessel readied port, and Captain
Kassler was taken ashore a few days ago
and sent to the German Hospital suffer
ing from an acute attack of rheumatism.
Captain Wirschuleit took his place for the
time being, but later he was succeeded Dy
Captain Schwarting, who has made many
trips among the islands. The last time
Schwarting left here ne was in command
of the little schooner Mercur, built by
Mattnew Turner, and was on his way
back here when he encountered the John
WeÂ»ley and took passage on her. The lit
tle bark after reloading will make an
other irip to the islands, and the captain
will make ayenerai cruise from one point
to another.
There were a number of changes on the
water front yesterday. Senator Percy
Henderson succeeded Major Harney as
Port Warden, and the latter toofc his seat
as Harbor Commissioner. Senator Hen
derson is known from one end of the City
and County to the other, and he is sure
io make an efficient ollicer. When takint;
his seat as Harbor Commissioner Mr.
Harney said: "If I can fill the position
and do as much lor the water Iront during
mv term of office as Mr. Coie has done I
will be more than satisfied. A more effi
cient officer," said he, "has never served
the State, and he can well afford to s:and
on his record." Mr. Cole then paid a com
oliment to Mr. Harney. and spoke of his
many years of service on the front, and
pointed out that he, more than any o'her
man, was conversant with the necessity of
a free market.
In conclusion, President Colnon char
acterized "Uncle Dan" as the "most hon
est and conscientious official" he had seen
in many a year. He was for the State
first, last and all the time," said Mr. Col
non, "and even tiiou^h he is on one side
of tlia fence anil I on the other, I am sorry
to lose him. Mr. Cole and men like him
are the bone and sinew of the State, and
1 wish we had many more like him in our
public offices."
Mr. Cole then in a few graceful words
turned his chair over to Major Harney,
and the business of tne board weui along
as usual.

tralia sailed for Honolulu yesterday. She

popular agent of the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company, while the Jordan family
are from tbe Orpheum and are on their
way to Hawaii on a theatrical tour.
E. T. Morgan, a well-known man about
town, was eagerly looked fcr as the sailing
hour of the Australia approached. He
was charged with deserting his mfuor
child, and the bail was tiled at $2500. in
order thai he should noc escape ttie wife
kept watch at one end of the sliip and
Officer McGreevy kept guard over the
gangplank. Just before sailing time a
thorough search of the steamer was made,
out no Morgan could be found. The wife
explained to the police officer that she did
not want her husband arrested if he would

Ultimatum of Champion
Fitzsimmons to James
J. Corbstt.
The Pugilists Meet and Discuss
Fisticuffs Over Ginger
Ale.
"Fitz" Was "Ro sted" Because H;
Refused an Editor a Flash
light Picture.
Jim Corbett is now resting easy. He
has seen and talked with Fitzsimmons
and received an answer to a question
which had beon bothering him very much
since his return from Carson.
Yesterday morning Corbett and some of
his friends hung around the Baldwin Ho
tel for ihe purpose of meetinsr Champion
Bob Fitzsimmons, who returned from Sac
ramento yesterday noon and was driven
to the Baldwin. Soon after he strolled
toward the grillroom, and there he met
his vanquished opponent, who was de
termined upon bavin* a little chat.
"How do you do, Fitz?" said Corbett, a?
he stepped toward the cnampion with the
right hand extended.
"I'm lirst-class," replied Fitz; "how are
you?"
"Fine," retorted Corbett. "Any objec
tion to take a drink with me?"
"Why, certainly not!" answered the
champion with a smile on his face.
Julian, Hicfcey and Sielzner. anticipat
ing that there might possibly be some
trouble over a meeting between Bob and
Jim. put in an appearance immediately
after tbe great fiehters warmed ud to the
conversation, but there was not the leust
necessity lor re-enforcements.
After a hearty handshake and an ex
change of good wishes the champion and
the ex-champion adjourned to the bar.
"What is your pleasure, Fitz?" asked
Corbett
Trie champion ordered ginger ale and
Corbett took the same medicine.
As ti.e ex-champion held his glass to his
lips he looked the champion in the eyes
and remarked: "Fitz, you've got to give
me another fight."
"I'm not just ready to talk fight now,"
responded Fitzsimmons, as another smile
illuminated his features.
The drinks disappeared and Corbett
again put the question to Fitz, deter
mined to have a definite answer.
Julian at this juncture stopped the con
versation by stating that there was a time
and place for all things and that fight talk
in front of a bar and in the presence of a
large crowd was not in order.
Corbett suggested that they would take
a sent in one of tbe compartments of the
hotel and talk business.
Fitzsimmons, to be agreeable, acqui
esced, and then the clever boxer and the
famous puncher of men adjourned to the
grillroom and the chat was resumed.
"Well, Fi.z, 1 must confess that you
whipped me fairly and I wish you success
in future, but I want one more cliance;
will you five it tome?"
Fitz hesitated a few moments and then
said: '.I have promised my wife never to
enter the ring again tor tbe purpose of
engaging in a prize-light, and that I* a
promise I shall never break as long as I
live. I have won all the distinction that
any man in my business could wish for,
and I think it is time for me to retire."
"Well." retorted Corbett, "will you give
me the first chance, in case you ahould
alter your mind?"
"1 have said once and for all that I am
not going to do any more fighting, but if
it will please you," answered the cham
pion, "I shall give you preference over
the others."
"That's a go, then?" inquired Corbett,
very anxiously.
"Yea, that goes," ana the pugilists
shook liands over the bargain.
This finishei the conversation, so far
as a second pugilistic contest was con
cerned, and then other subjects were dis
eased.
"Well, if 1 cannot succeed in getting
another go with yon,' said Corbett, "I
will retire from the ring, too."
"Why, you can make money by whip
ping Peter Maher, who is a great fighter,"
replied Fitz.
Corbett gazed at tbe champion with a
look of astonishment on his lace, and for
a lew moments he seemed non-plussed.
He roust have thought that Fitz was
cracking a joke, until the champion re
lieved him of suspense by adding that in
his opinion Maher was the greatest fighter
of the day.
"Do you imply," said Corbett, nerv
ous v, "that Maher can whip you?"
"No; I fion't #iean any* such thing,"
answered Fitz, "because 1 whipped him
twice, and I think that should be enough
to satisfy any man."
"Well, then, do you mean to say that
Maher can whip me?" retorted Corbett,
anxiously.
"That's it exactly. I think that Maher
can whip any man living excepting my
self, and that is no joke either," answered
tbe champion as he watched the quiver
on Corbett's lips.
"Well, that's a hard one on me," was
the meek reply of Corbett, as he felt the
sting of the champion's out and above
board opinion.
Evidently Fitzsimmons bad in mind
the treatment he received from Corbett
when the latter, to avoid a meeting with
of the
Fiizsimmons, handed over to Maher the
championship.
The battles between Fitzsimmons and
Maher in New Orleans and Mexico are still
fresh in the minds of the sporting men
of this country and there is no man who
has a better right to express an omnion of
Maher's fighting abilities than Champion
Robert Fiiz^immons.
While conversing with Fitzsimmons
after his interview with Corbett, the
champion said he was agreeably surprised
to find that the ex-champion had left all
of his h4avy shot behind. "In fact." said
Fitz-immons, "he treated me real nice
and I returned the compliment, but I had
material in store to fling back at him in
case he showed a disposition to be nasty."
The champion was very angry about
an article which appeared in a morning
paper and in which he, Fitzsimmons, was
accused of being drunk and quarrelsome.
"I know why all that rot appeared in
the paper," replied Fitz, as his eyes
flashed and his fingers twitched.
"You know," he continued, "that on
the evning of my arrival from Carson
Long Green of the Examiner sent an
artist to my room with instruction to get
a liashlight picture of me. I informed the
artist that I was too tired after my
journey and I felt more lite taking a well
needed lest than poking for pictures. In
fact, I have been â that is, photographi
cally speaking â shot almost to death by
cameras during my residence in Carson,
and when I camo to this City I thought I
had escaped the fiends, but you can imag
ine my surprise when I was confronted by
a flashlichsar from the Examiner on reach
ing my room and informed that the mon
arch wanted just one more shot.
"I was deaf to all entreaties and begged
to be excused.
"Well, don't you know that camera man
talked and talked until afier midnight,
when I finally tell into a comfortablecuair
knocked stiff. I was dead :o the world
lor the time being until my wife woke me
up, and there was that awful man still
standing over me waitinc for the oppor
tunity to take just one more Bhot.
"Well, I could not stand 'he agony any
longer and I told the unfortunate artist,
who was, ot course, obeying orders, to go
home and be a good fellow, adding that
under no consideration would I stand for
a fla-'hiiifht shot uutil my brother-in-law
and manager, Martin Julian, arrived from
the mountains.
"He reluctantly took his hat in band
and left the room, muttering something to
himself. 1 guess he was saying his pray
rrs, but soe what was the result. I was
slaughtered in this morning's Examiner.
Thi- paper said that I made a beast 01 my
self and a whole lot of stuff that is not tit
for publication in any respectable journal,
but my friends know too well that 1 nm
not a drinking man, and that is sufficient
recommendation fur me. I am eating
shrimps now, bat I guess I will be painted
a demon in to-morrow's paper. I suppose
that in a free couutry everything goes."
Fitzsimmons. paid a visit to The Call
business office yesterday afternoon. The
champion wanted to express his thank*
for the fair and impartinl manner in
which Thk Call treated both principals
from the time the mutch was consum
mated until the championship was lost
and won.
Fiizsimmons expects to remain in this
City a week, until his manacer decides
upon some future course. The champion
will visit Eddie Graney's blacksmith-shop
to-day for th<Â» purpose of turning ont
some fancy ahoes as souvenirs for his
friends.
UNION LABOR PROTESTS.
Supervisors Asked to Stop Brick
laying on the Hall
of Justice.
The Contractor for the Removal of
Debris Ordered to Finish
His Job at Once.
The contractor to whom Bateman
Bros., the contractors for the new Hall of
Justic?, have sublet the work of building
the foundations, will not be permitted by
the union bricklayers of this City to go on
with t!ie work with bis present force with
out a protest.
The union claims that tbe Board of
Supervisors has declared that all work on
public buildings must be done Dy union
labor and that Stiles, the contractor men
tioned, is employing outside bricklayers.
They also claim that he is an enemy of
organized labor and that he has bad trou
ble in other cities.
A delegation from the union appeared
beiore the Public Buildings Committee of
the Board of Supervisors yesterday and
asked that the contractor mentioned be
prevented frem going on with the job and
that only union men be allowed to wort
on the job. The committee listened to
the protest and promised to look into the
matter at an early date and take what
ever action is just and legal in the prem
ises.
The matter will probably come up at
the meeting of the board on Monday
next, as the union men say they bave
friends in tbe board who will see that
their interests are not allowed to suffer.
At tbe meeting of the committee Bate
man Bros, reported that all of tbe ob
structions to going on with tbe laying of
foundations were not out' of the way and
that there were yet two walls to be re
moved before they could resume opera
tions.
The committee ordered the contractor
who undertook to remove the old walls to
take away the objectionable walls forth
with.

OUTWITTED THE
FEDERAL OFFICERS
Chinese Women Prisoners
Produce Landing
Certificates.
All but Three of Thirteen Sus
pects Gathered in Mon
day Released.
Maj-T Moore Learns That the Sam
Tups Kn.w of His Inten
tions ia Advance.
The crusade inaugurated by thÂ« treas
ury officials against the illegal landing of
Chinese is not meeting with the success
its promoters hoped for. Of th* thirteen
Chinese women held over from Monday's
raid by Captain Wittman and the police
force ten were discharged yesterday for
want of evidence. To make matters worse
habeas-corpus proceedings to secure the
release ot the remaining three were is
sued by Judge Carroll Cook, to be heard
this morning at 10 o'clock.
The imprisoned women spent Monday
night in a room in the upper floor of the
Presbyterian Mission Home at 920 Sacra
mento street. They were rebellious ami
sulky, and made the night air mournful
with their wailing.
When Special Agent Moore prepared to
file complaints again them yesterday
morning he was confronted with some un
expected complications. Six of the iris
oners presented certificates of legal entry
duly signed and authorized by Collector
Wise. Attorney Henry E. Monroe, who
was assisting the investigation on behalf
of the See Yup Society, and the Presby
terian Mission, advised the release of this
contingent. The treasury officials con
tinued their work only to come to the
conclusion that they could make but a
poor case against four more of the women,
and decided to release them.
This was decidedly disconragi"E. The
remaining three prisoners were put
through a thorough examination, and
managed to contradict themselves in near
ly every statement. The treasury people
accordingly d^-cHed to hold them prison
ers for examination before United States
Commissioner Hcacock. Complaints
charging them with being in the United
States in violation of the exclusion act
were filed in the United States 4 District
Court by De Witt C. Jackson, a special
agent of the treasury.
Scarcely had this been accomplished
when a counter move was made by the
"friends" of the imprisoned women. On
behs.it of various Chinese "merchants"
who were willing to swear that the pris
oners were alt born in this country, At
torney Robert Ferral secured a writ 01 tia
beas corpus, directed against Mis-j Culbert
son, the superintendent of the Mission
Home, commanding her to produce the
prisoners at 10 o'clock this morning in
.Indue Cook's court. So there is likely to
be a lively tight for the possession of the
women.
The names of the prisoners are Yai Lin
Of, Chong Ngan Ying and Quan Yaw
Choy. They are young and good looking
from the Chinese point of view. Miss Cul
bertson offered them a home in the mis
sion if they preferred to remain there
rather than to return to tfce dens on Bart
lett and Sullivan alleys, but her good
offices fell on dumb ears. The three
landed here on December 23 last, and
almost immediately found their wuy into
the dens where Captain Wittman and bis
police officers found them. They main
tain that they were all born in San Fran
cisco.
The next move of the Treasury Depart
ment will depend, in a measure, on the
success attending the attempt to deport
the three women now in the mission
home It is understood the Bee Yups are
willing to co-operate with Major Moore in
this ca-e, as they nrofess to see their old
enemy, the Bam Yups, behind the impor
tation of the women. But it happened
that this alliance did not turn out as
profitable as expected. The treasury
agents have discovered that the news of
their intention to make Monday's raid
bad preceded the police officers all over
Chinatown. It would seem that that
much talked of Custom-house scandal is
still some distance off.

INDORSED BY
MAYOR PHELAN
He Favors the Pending
" Municipal Pawn
shop" Bill.
Says It Would Be a Great Boon
to the Poor of San Fran
cisco.
Comments on the Outrageous Interest
Now Charged by Many Local
Pawnbrokers.
Mayor Phelan yesterday signed and
transmute I to Governor Budd an iii'lorse
ment of the "municipal pawnshop bill."
lhe biil contemplates the establishing
of a collateral loan bank at which the
indigent may obtain advances on prop
erty of all kinds at a reasonable rate of
interest. The bill provides that the in-
stitution must be incorporated with a
capital stock of not less than $100,000, and
in sections 3 and 4 says:
Every corporation applying for a license
under this t>ct shall at the time of making the
application file with the secretary of ihe Board
of Bank Commissioners a bond to the people
of the btate, executed by the corporation ap
plying for the license, with good and sufficient
sureties to be approved by said commission
ers, in the penal sum of $5000, conditioned
for the faithful performance of the duties and
obligations pertaining to the business so
licensed and for a faithful compliance with
the provisions of this act Said oond shall be
renewed and refllea annually, in January ol
each year, or the corporation shall within
thirty days thereafter cease doing business
and proceed to close ud its affairs.
Such corporations, when they have dispos
able lunds, shall loan on all goods and chat
tels, or on all sale securities offered, embraced
within its rii.ci and regulations, in the order
iv which they are offered, with this excep
tion, that they may always discriminate iv
favor of small loans to the indigent.
Section 6, relating to interest, reads:
Such corporations shall in no case charge
interest at a rate exceeding 2 per cent per
month; provided, however, that ail loans
shall be subject to one month's interest, and
m> loan shah be settled at a less charge than
15 cents.
The sale of pledged property is provided
for as follows:
Property pledged to such corporations must
be Held six months after the last date fixed by
contract lor redemption, and all sales shall be
at public auction; and notice of such sale
shall be published at least five days previous
thereto in a daily newspaper prinleu in the
county, or city and county, in which any
such corporation ii located. If upon the
sale oJ any such property at public auction
there be any surplus left, after paying
tho amount of the loan and interest due
thereon, and 5 jÂ»-r cent on the amount of the
loan for expenses of sale, the tame shall be
paid over to the party who would be entitled
to redeem the pledge in case no such sale had
taken place. In case a savings bank deposit
book pledged to any such corporation shall
hot be redeemed as above, it shall not sell the
same at puDlic auction, but it may convert the
same, or so much ihervoi as may be necessary
to pay the debt, lv snch manner and at such
time as in the judgment ol the directors of
such corporation will best serve the interests
of all parties holding the [balance] lor the
owner.
The institution is placed under tbe con
trol of tbe Bank Commissioners.'
"I am in favor of this bill because of the
shameful manner in which many pawn
brokers plunder their customers, 1 ' said
Mayor Phelan yesterday. "They charge
10 or 20 per cent interest, and tne poor
person who must borrow is compelled to
pay. Of late the pawnbrokers buy the
goods offered and execute an agreement to
sell back the same at an immense ad
van re.
"Such institutions as are contemplated
by this bill have succeeded to a marked
degree in Europe and the Eastern States,
and have been a great boon to the poor.
There is little or no chance of their being
robbea, and at the same time it will be
profitable to those who start it."
VALUABLE FISH TBAIJOHISE.
J. B, Inguglia Sued by the American
Union F,gh Company.
J. B. Inguelia is defendant in a suit for
damages instituted by the American
Union Fisa Company. On the 30th of
March, 1893, Inguglia sold his risti busi
ness in the San Francisco Market on Mer
chant street to the plaintiff company for
$4500 and agreed to keep out of the fish
business in thin City for five years, or to
pay a penalty of $2255. The complaint
alleges that the defendant broke his con
tract r>y going into the fish business on
July 4 last, continuing the name to the

SOME NEW LAW
FOR CALIFORNIA
MARRIED WOMEN.
Wives Declared to Have No
Right in Community
Property*
ECHO OF THE SPRECKELS CASE.
A Startling Definition of the Duties and Ob
ligations of a Husband by the
Supreme Court.
The wives of California w:'ll find some
very novel and interesting reading in a
decision rendered by the Supreme Court
yesterday, and they will no doubt be sur
prised to learn that their rights and in
terests in community property are prac
tically myihical and that the husband
may spend it pretty much ss he pleases,
all of which is news to married men and
women.
Tno particular case in which all this
novel Jaw is expounded is a decision ren
dered by the court in the suit of Claus
Spreckels against his son' Rudolph to re
cover a gift of su^ar stock made without
the consent of Mr*. Spreckels. Tne Su
preme Court sustains the judgment of
Judge Slack in favor of the son, and lays
down an elaborate definition of the rights
of married women in community prop
erty.
The action was begun to recover $500,
--000 worth of the stock of the Paauhnu
Plantation Company in the Hawaiian
Islands, which the father deeded Iris son
on July 31, 1893, without the consent of
Mrs. Spreckels. It was commenced under
an amendment to the Civil Code mado in
March, 1891. Prior to the amendment
the coae declared that "the husband has
the management and control of com
munity property, with the like power of
disposition (other than testamentary) as I
be lias of his separate estate. " The amend- {
merit was to the effect that "provided,
however, that he cannot make a gift of
such property, or convey the same with
out a valuable consideration, unless the
wife in writing consents thereto."
Rudolph Spreckels demurred on the ;
ground that the complaint did not state j
a cause of action and contended that the j
- amendment did not appiy to property
prior to its adoption, on the ground that
it . would deprive the husband of his j
vested proprietary rights in community j
property.
The Supreme Court reviews the law in
detail relating to community property
and concludes that:
Â£ "Prior to the amendments of 1891 the
code vested in the husband, with refer
. ence to the community property, all the
elements of ownership and in, the wife ;
none. If the rights of the parties in the
community property are the same then !
the law is partial to the wife. She can |
â¢ easily manage that all her earnings and
accumulations shall be her separate prop
erty. The husband can in no way obtain
a similar advantage. If the wife is living
separate and apart from the husband,
through her own fault, her earnings and
accumulations are her own. Yet, if the
husband durin? the same time accumu
lated a fortune it is community property.
There is no mode in which community
property can be converted into his sepa
rate property.
"As -to ali the world, except the wife,
there was.prior to this amendment, no dis
tinction between the community estate and
the separate estate of the husband. If sun
were brought upon a liability incurred in
a business, the profits of which would be
community property, and judgment re
covered, execution could be levied upon
the separate estate of the husband and
the debt entirely satisfied therefrom. His
separate estate, during the entire mar
riage, is liable to be taken for community
debts, and, of course, famishes a credit in
aid of community business. If thd com
m-unity loses, the loss may fall upon bis
separate estate, but his separate estate
cannot profit by the success of the com
munity.
"The separate property of the wife is
exempt from all these liabilities, but on
the.other hand the community property
is liable for debts incurred by the hus
band in the management of his separate
estate."
Justice Temple, who wrote the decision,
sums it up this way: "Now, all these dif
ferences point to the fact that the husband
is the absolute owner of the community
property."
Continuing, he issues this startling
statement as to the rights of wives:
"The marital community was not or
ganised for the purpose of accumulating
property, and the husband owes no duty
to the community or to the wife either to
, labor or accumulate money or to save or
practice economy to that end. He owes
bis wife and children suitable main
tenance, and if he has sufficient income
from his separate estate for that purpose
he need not engage in business or so live
that there can be community property.
If he earns more than is sufficient for
such maintenance he violates no legal ob
â¢ ligation if be so6nds the surplus in ex
travagance or gives it away, The com
munity property may be lo?t in visionary
schemes or in mere wnims. Within tha
law, he may live his life, although the
community estate is dissipated. Of
course I am not now speaking of his
moral obligations."
In his review of former decisions in this
State and the Mexican laws from which
the California system is deiived Justice
Temple shows that the wife was deemed
to have a nominal ownership in property,
or as he expresses it, "a mere expect
ancy," but even this is now taken away.
"While sweeping away the vestige of the
wile's ri^ht to the benefit of her economy
and thrift in household expenses the
court gives married women generally a
valuable piecs of information, tiiougu
somewhat obscured by language. Here
it is:
"If the wife has separate property tlie
"increase derived from it is also separate
property; only the earnings and the profits
gained in business, and the increase of
properly so acquired, is community prop
erty; and, as we have seen, the wife may
so manage as to convert all gains derived
from business transacted by her into her
separata property."
The way in which the wife may so man
ago as to protect herself is indicated in
this statement:
"It has been held that the husband can
make a gift of the community property to
the wife and convert it into her separate
estate. To this it may be added that the
wife, if possessed of business capacity, can
obtain permission to carry on business in
her own name as a sole trader, and that
the profits of such business are her sepa
rate properly."
Justices Henshaw, Harrison and McFar
land concur with Justice Temple. Chief
Justice Beatty also concurred in the judg
ment, but upon d'flerent grounds, his
principal reason being that while a case
might arise in which the circumstances
would warrant an action like the Spreckels
case, in this action it "'does not appear
that the amount of the gift was so dispro
portionate to the amount of the commu
nity property as to endanger the right of
the wife to her full share on the dissolu
tion of the community, or to deprive the
husDand of the mean* of supporting his
wife or others dependent upon him."
JUSTICE AID MUSICIAN.
The Grand Jury Is Investigat
ing the Nature of Their
Rela ionsbip.
The Young Lady C'.aifiU to Ba the
Victim of Sharp Practice and
Sseks R v;nge.
Justice of the Peace John A. Carroll is
charged with malfeasance in office before
the Grand Jury, and that body spent the
entire afternoon yesterday in hearing the
evidence in the matter. It wai brought
before the jury a week ago as a case of
embezzlementâ the embezzlemeat of a
mandolin valued at $160. This charge,
however, did not stand before the inquiry
instituted, and, if any wrong serious
enough to warrant a true bill by the jury
is discovered, it will be that stated.
The pro.-ecuting witness is Miss Josie
Gibbons. She was represented yesterday
by "Jack" Stevens, her attorney. The
story Mr. Stevens tells is this:
Miss Gibbons purchased a mandolin
from her teacher, G. C. Cipollini, agreeing
to pay $160 in installments. She had paid
570 when Cipoliini began suit to recover
tues9o<iue at once, or the return of the
mandolin. The case was heard before
Justice Carroll, who dismissed it on a
technicality and gave judgment for the
girl. Cipollini then brought suit again,
and this time the case was sent to Justice
Cook's court.
Pending trial Justice Carroll went to
the girl's bouse and told her that a search
warrant had been issued, and that she
had better give the mandolin into his
Keeping to prevent the other side from
getting hold of it. She gave him the in
strument, and he ha? kept possession of
it ever since, or until the Grand Jury sum
moned him to explain the matter, when
he gave it into their nands.
The caee was heard or. rather, called in
Justice Cook's court on the 18th inst., and
because Miss Gibbons was not present
judgment was rendered for CipoilinL Miss
Gibbons was not present because she was
not notified and knew nothing of the case
coming to trial.
Justice Carroll had assured her that he
would look after her interests and do all
he could lor her. It seems that sbÂ« was
represented by a young attorney whom
Carroll had a*ked" to appear for her â a
man whom she does not know, whom she
never saw, and who did not advise her of
the case coming to trial, but who absented
io the judement. The anawer to the
charge as filed in Cook's court is said to
be in Carroll's handwriting, and also a
demurrer that was hied.
This is thÂ« part of the transaction that
the Grand Jury is taking cognizance of â
tne court records in the case wherein the
Justice ot the Peace appears to be talcing
tbe part of attorney, to the discomfiture
of the client.
Justice Carroll declares himself inno
cent of any wrongdoing in the matter,
and says he had nothing to do with the
case after ie left his court except to take
care of tbe mandolin at the young
woman's request.
The cast will be heard further on Fri
day.
W. A. KEEFER MISSING.
The Well-Known M mm; Man Not Seen
for Over a Week.
W. A. Keefer the secretary of the Ju-
Diter Gravel and Water Company U miss
ing and that is why at the regular meet
ing of the company yesterday at 14 Grant
avenue a temporary secretary performed
Keefer's duties. No one seems to know
what has become of the secretary. Some
suggest foui play and others attribute his
absence to troubles in the company of
which he is th? secretary.
A week ago A. B. Thompson, the presi
dent of i he company, went with Keefer to
the Jupiter prnrwrty in Calaveras County.
One morning Keefar took his depart ure
and that is the mst Mr. ThompsoD saw of
him, although lie made diligent inquiry
in Cnlaveras Connty for the man. In the
meantime the regular assessments fell
due, but Keefer failed to return to
the otlice in this City to the at
tend to business, so the meeting was
held without him. A search in his room,
which is in the same building, showed
that Keefer's papers, books and other ef
fects were scattered all over the apart
ment, but whether by the owner or out
siders is not known.
Keefer has in the past few years been in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 24, 1897.
n lot of trouble, particularly with a Mrs
Dr. Newman, who caused his arrest. He
was quickly acquitted, but the trouble be
tween himself and the woman, which
giew out of mining transactions, did not
cease. The probability is that Keefer has
gone East to attend to some mining busi
ness he has there, possibly to sell a mine
or two.

tin in his suit against the Daily Report

County of San Francisco.

fore awarded by the Board of Supervisors
of the City and County of San Francisco*
to the Daily Report Publishing Company,
1o do the rmbhc printing for the years
1897 and 1898, be annulled and set aside,
and that the same be awarded to plaintiff

states facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action.

litigation Judge Hebbard rendered the
following decision : "The demurrer to the
petition for the writ of mandate is sus
tained and the writ is dismissed. The de
murrer to the complaint for injunction is
sustained and the suit is dismissed."

TEE SUNOL DISASTER.
Caused, It Is Baid, by the Rudder Not
* VmrkiiiK Properly.
The investieation into the collision be
tween the bark Olympic and the river
steamer Sunol, in which the latter was
sunk on March 17. was begun yesterday
before the local United States inspectors
of hulls and boilers.
So far as the testimony of the witnesses
went no new light wns thrown on the
affair. The evidence of S. \V. Dye, master
or the Sunol, went to show that the acci
dent was caused by the rudder of his ves
sel becoming cramped at a critical .no
ment and refusing to answer the helm.
This he says was partly caused by the
strong tide. His testimony was as follows:
I left Washington-street wharf on March 17,
1897. with about forty passengers. After pro
ceeding on my course for about nine minutes,
whenn liitle north of Blossom Rock Duoy.l saw
a four-masted bark proceeding up the bayunder
sail. When nearing the aforesaid bark I in
tended going under her stern, but on attempt
ing to starboard my helm I found that lor
home reason I could not move the wheel. I
immediately rung the bell to 6top nnd back,
and ulter backing a few minutes found my
rudder was still foul, as I could not move the
wheel. I then saw my only chance to clear
was to go ahead of the ship, so rang the bell
to go ahead again. The bark strnck the Sunol
about midships. The crew and passengers
were all saved. The steamer is now lying cap
sized near the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany's wharf.
His testimony was substantiated by that
of his first mate and the man who at the
time was at the wheel.
A WILL OR A TRUST?
Mrs. Miranda A. Cunningham'* I,aÂ»t
Testament la in Dispute.
Mrs. Lucie Megie has filed a petition to
have the will of the late Mrs. Miranda A.
Cunningham declared of no effect and
that she, as next of kin, shall be awarded
tne property.
In her will Mrs. Cunningham pave her
property to Job a J. Mooney of Visalia,
"to use as he may think best, said John J.
Mooney to be executor without bonds."
Mrs. Me~ie asserts tnat this provision of
the will bestows on Mr. Mooney the prop
erty for his use only; that it create* a
trust; that Mr. Mooney is constituted trus
tee thereby, and that uncertainty as to
the duration of the trust and in regard to
the beneficiaries arises on the face of the
instrument.
Additional allegations are presented to
the effect mat the signing of the pretended
will was procured by menace, duress and
undue influence.
Relying on the recent decisions of the
California Supreme Court in the Walkerly
case touching the question of trusts, the
petitioner asks that ihe probate of the will
be annulled and that the letters testamen
tary thereon be revoked, and that she
shall have such other r.-lief as may be
right.

"LES HUGUENOTS"
SUNG IN FRENCH
Meyerbser's Work Seems
to Be a Local
Favorite.
The Most Grandiose Production
It Has Received Here
for Years.
_/
The Tenor Surpasses Himself in High
Notes Long Drawn Outâ A bers'
Artistic Philip de Nevcrs.
Meyerbeer's "Huguenots" must be a
favorite with San Francisco opera-goers,
for the largest audience that has attended
the California since the opening of the
French season welcomed the work last
night and save every outward and visible
sign of enjoying it.
The showy if somewhat tinselly work
has never been so well performed in this
City in recent years. The singers were
nearly all thoroughly up to the require
ments of tha florid music, which seems to
hnvo been written with an eye to afford
ing opportunities for the display of vocal
fireworks, and the fine male choruses in
which the opera abounds were nearly all
sung with a good volume of tone and
plenty of rhythmic swing.
The grandiose finales were rendered so
impressively tbat at the end of most of
the acts the audience insisted on having
the curtain raised repeatedly.
"The Hueuenots" is not only pretentious
in its music, it also demands a grand
mise en scene. The scenic appointments
of the French company are generally con
spicuous for their poverty, for the New
Orleans Opera House refused to lend its
scenery for the deieciation of California
audiences.
The company owns its own costumes,
however, and some cf them are very
effective. Last night, thanks to brilliant
costumes and clever groupings of chorus
and ballet, the stage presented a really
fine apnearance ; the tableau at the end
of the third act was as brilliant and effect
ive a stage picture as the most bias*
t neater-goer could ask to see.
Henri Albert, who generally over
shadows his fellow-nrtists, was an ideal
Philip de Nevers. It is not only the
pnmo baritono assoluto's sinking which
wins him the bravos of opere-goer?, but
his qualities as an all-around artist. In
every detail of his bearing and dress he
was the courtly cavalier, and his singing
was, as usual, a pleasure to the ear.
Prevost was Raoul, and he positively
surpassed himself in burling robust high
notes in the chest register at the audience.
He held on to them longer than usual and
threw them out with such force that the
audience was carried by storm. At the
end of the second act, where Raoul refuses
to marry Valentine, Prevost acted with a
good deal of dramatic force, but on the
whole his singing was better than his act
ing.
Athes won a good deal of applause for
Marcel's "Pirn Pum" song, tnough his
voice is not strong enough in the low
notes of the role, which is one of the most
thankless in the bass repertory. The
minor small roles were exceptionally well
tilled.
Mine. Foedor made an excellent Valen
tine, especially in the with Marcel.
Mme. Uerthet's light voice was especially
well adapted to the florid music of Mar
guerite de Navarre's lines, and she, too,
won a large meed of applause.
Andree Savine, who is a clever dlvette
of opera, does not seem in her element in
grand opera. It is true that lttst nicht
she won plenty of applause for her sine
ing of the page's aria, "NoOil, Signor,"
but the familiarity of the < icerpt no
doubt had something to do with this.
Strange to say, Mme. Savine did not at
tempt any acting in the pate's role.
The weak part of the performance was,
as usual, the female choruses, which, as
usual, were quite below the standard of
the rest of the production. Some of the
mixed choruses were eood, especially in
the finales. Brilliant work was done by
Mile, de Consoli, the prima ballerina.

he owes to suffering humanity â to donate
bis infallible cure to all afflicted.
Chemistry and science are daily .aston-
ishing the world with new wonders. It is
no longer safe to say tha'. anything may
not be achieved. The researches and ex-

results as beneficial to humanity as can
be claimed for any modern genius or
philosopher.

The medical profession throughout
America and Europe are unanimous in
the opinion that catarrhal affections and
pulmonary troubles lead to consumption,
and consumption, uninterrupted, means
speedy and certain death. No one having
or threatened with any diÂ«ease should
hesitate n day. Simp'y write to T. A.

Every sufferer should take advantage of
this most liberal proposition. A system
of medicine xhat will cure consumption
is good for any disease that humanity is

BEAT THE BARRIER
Snapped From the Back of
Gocd Times in a
Breakaway.
Buckwa Defeated Pat Dunne's
Salvable With Campara
tive Ease.
Russella Won at Odds of 30 to 1
Morte Fonse Scores Againâ Outlay
a Handy Winner.
As a hod-carrier, with a hodfui of
bricks on shoulder, slowly and deftly
climbs the ladder of a thirteen-story
building in course of construction, per
haps- to' fa me, and then again only to go
down for another load, reads the
papers ot the stupendous salaries paid
jockeys ne evidently thinks his lota hard
one and that these lads have what is
commonly termed a soft snap. And it
doss teem as though the knights of the
pigskin were munificently remunerated
for their work in the saddle. Still, all
their snaps are not exactly "soft" ones.
Among the events decided at Ingleside
-sLeniay was a mile dash for a $500 purse.
W 1 he starters included such good performers
fas Buckwa, Salvable, Argentina 11, Good
Times and Lincoln 11. Buckwa was a
pronounced choice, with SalvaDle quite 8s
heavily backed by his party. Tod Sloan
had the mount on Good Times, and in a
fal&e breakaway the barrier failed 10 give
way, and Tod, catching tne barrier under
his chin, was snapped off his mount,
alighting gracefully on his head in the
soft loamy dressing of the track. Tnougn
not wounded unio death, nor yet even
badly injured, it required tiie services of
two assistants to carry Tod to the sur
geon's.room, where an examination re
vealed the fact tnat no damage had re
sulted, and Sloan rodo again later on in
Uie dajr.
All bets, however, had to be declared
eft and Slaughter substituted astride
Good Times. The horses came out after
an interval of twenty rnnuts ana Buok
wÂ» won easily from Salvabie in 1:41 1Â£
after making, all the running.
Favorites hÂ«d things about their own
way, winning fiv.j of the seven events run
off. Russella was tne longest priced win
ner of the day, taking the fourtn even:,
bucked down lrom odds of 30 to 1 to 12.
Fourteen maiden two-year-oids lined
up in. the three and a naif furlong scram
ble that opened the afternoon's sport.
Pat Dunne's big son of Owas, the chestnut
Outlay, was apparently the #ood thing,
being backed down to 8 to 5 favoritism.
lie showed the w.ay for his company from
the jump, winning handily by two
lengths from Recreation in :44}Â£. The
Processor was third.
ihe second event at six furlongs, de
cked under selling condition?, was pro
lific of several good things, Milce Rice,
Manchester, Favory and Satyr all being
well backed. A bad start ruined the
cfeancea of most of them, and tije 2 to 1
cuoice, Miss Ross, getting away first, won
all the way. " Cappy, a 15 to 1 chance, was
a good second in front of Manchester.
Dan Htyng, the St. Louis horseman,
slipped in a warm one in the six-furlong
selling sprint, that was fourth on the pro
gramme. Russelia, a filly by Brittanic,
backed from :^0 down to 12, took the lead
from Gutta Percha at the stretch and won
ridden out, half a length ahead of Wyom
ing, another outsider. Bueno, the 2to 1

Bad atari. Won easily. Winner, JC W. Purser's cli. t, by bpnngbok-ttap. Jimerald. Time,
choioe, ran well for about half tbe dis
tance.
There were but four starters in the mile
and a quarter run, Don Clarencio, Can't
Dance, Judge Denny and" Morte Fonse:
The latter was backed down from 3 to 2 to
11 to 10. and in a drive through the stretch
outran the second choice. Judge Denny,
and won by half a length in 2:10K- Don
Clarencio, who male the pace ior half
a mile, finished third.
Pat Dunne's Damien was in big demand
to win the mile selling affair, being heav
ily played at odcts of 7 to 10 and 3 to 5. He
was evidently not up to a hard race, for
after heading Cabrillo until the turn into
the stretch was made lie was collared and
beaten out easily by The Roman, which
horse got through next the rail. The win
ner opened in the betting at 8 to 5, reced
ing to sto 2. McLight, the other starter,
was beaten away oft.
Scarf Pin, the fast filly carrying Ed
Purser's colors, disposed of her company
in the h'nal six-furlong dash without much
effort. Starting alto 2 favorite, she got
the best of a straggling start and lea Etta
H out by over two lengths. Green Morris'
tiliy Midlight was a good third.
NOTES.
August Belmont, the millionaire New
Ysrk patron of the. turf, was au onlooker
at the races yesterday.
â '. Pat Dunne asked Owner Boots to price
TilÂ© Roman after the sixth race, but Mr.
Boots said be guessed he would keep the
colt. v :' .' . '
Many thought that with a more even
start Etta H would have beaten Scarf Pin,
but this hardly seems probable as the lat
i ter won with plenty in reserve.
Unforeseen circumstances figure very
prominently in ; the victory of rank out
siders as a rule. The win of Russella was
indeed a lucky one ;as 'Wyoming/ badly
messed about and cut off down the back
stretch, was pounds the best horse.

Wheelmen defeated the host of crack
Eastern and local professional racers at
the Pavilion cycle meet last night.
It was in the half-mile event that Wells
turned the trick. The big iield had been
narrowed down by heais to fourâWells.
Eaton of Chicago, Stevens of lowa and
McFarland of San Jose.
It was a clean victory and marks the
CHARLES S. WELLS of the Bay Gty Wheelmen, Who Defeated
the Crack Eastern Riders at the Pavilion Last Night.
"boy wonder" as one of the speediest
riders of the world, for be earned his
laurels only by defeating champions.
Ljueheaci disappointed his admirers
1 last night. He qualified in his heat, but
was shut out in the semi-tinal of the hall
mi 'c.
T. H. White caused a bad fail in the sec
ond lieat of the amateur handicap by his
reckless riding. He tried to take the pole
from LanÃuetin on the last lap ami was
thrown, bringing down both Ihe other
contestants. Klfonl picked up his wheel
and started for the tape, but Languetin
managed to remount his and finished
first.
Alborelle treated himself to a tumble in
the third beat after the finish. He ran off
the track and then tried to ride up one of
the steep banks. Resnlt, a badly damaged
bicycle, the rider unhurt.
Foster was crowded in one of the semi
finals after the tapo bad been passe*!, and
went down, escaping injury, however.
The star event of last evening's pro
gramme was the half-mile open profes
sional run in six preliminary heats, three
semifinal and a final. In the first heat
were Loughead of Canada, Downing of
San Jose, Stevens of lowa and Dow of
Seattle. Stevens and Dow made the run
ning most of the way, but Loughead came
up and won as he pleased at the finish.
In the second heat were McFarland,
Olympic, Max Morris of Texas. F. M.
Byrne, Imperial, and Clarence Davis of
San Jose. This was McFarland's heat,
though Morris pressed him hard for the
honor.
Starbuck of Philadelphia, Whitman of
Los Angeles and Bovee of Texas com
peted in the third. The much-vaunted
Star Duck did not qualify, the heat goiug
to Bovee by three length* from Whitman.
C. 8. WeIJS and W. A. Terrill were the
only contestants in the fourth. Wells
won by a narrow margin. In the tilth
were Jay Eaton of Chicago, Harry Terrill
of the Bay Citys and Eidie Alien of Spo
kane. This was a pretty ride. Allen tried
to steal a march on tbe others by jump
ing out early in the race, but the others
were hot after him ana caught and oassed
him just before the tnne was reached.
Terrill got the decision, Eaton euond.
Then came the semi-finals, three in
number, in the first of which the starters
were Loughead, Becker, Bovee and Ste
vens. Becker jumped to the front early
in the ride and gained a lead that tbe
others could diminish but little. Stevens
got the place. Referee Plummer disquali
fied Becker and cave first place to Stevens,
which pave Bove* second. The decision
pleaded some of the audience, but the
noisier ones yelled for Becker, and for a
SPANISH CARNIVAL.

the sight of deformed skeletons that the

time pandemonium reigned. The referee's
decision remained unchanged, however,
though many thought he was discrimi
nating.
In tbe second semi-final were Wells,
McFarland, "Bob" Terrill and Morris.
Wells started one of his famous long
sprints on the second lap and kept it up
to the tape, winning cleverly. TerriU and
McFariahd fought for second place, the
latter winning.
The starters in the third were Eaton,
Foster. Harry Tewill and Whitman. This
bade fair to be and proved a hot run for
the money. Eaton took the lead from the
start and set a lively pace, with the others
close after him. Eaton won out and Ter
rill took tiie place. Foster ran off the
track just past the finish and fell, but he
jumped to his feet, apparently unhurt.
This brought into the final Stevens,
Wells, Eaton and McFarland. The start
was slow, but McFarland assumed the
lead at once and madf it fast, tbe order
beingâ McFarland,^Vells, Stevens, Eaton.
Wells rushed for the lead on the third
lap, and then ensued a pretty ride between
tbe four, all on even terms and all of
about equal speed. Wells had the pole
and would not give an inch, so the others
had to go around him.
Wells rounded into tbe homestretch in
the lead, with the others right on top of
him, but try as they would they could not
pass him, and he rode home a winner,
defeating Eaton by a wheel's length, with
Stevens just back of him. McFarland
was last. The time was 1:08 2-5.
The opening event of the evening was
the five-mile club cup raoe, third heat,
contested this time by E. F. Russ of the
Olympic Club Wheelmen, E. A. Bozio of
the Imperial Cyclins Club and Walter
Leitch, riding for the Alameda Cy
clers. Tbe pacing was done by A.
Theisen and C. J, Birdsall of tbe Califor
nia Club on a tandem.
The pace was a steady 2:20 clip from the
start, and was as pretty an exb.bition of
amateur pacing as has been seen on the
track. The tandem dropped out when
half of the last mite llad been completed
and left the men to themseive?. Russhad
the lead and the ot-ers could not pass
him, try as they would. Bozio finished a
close second. The time for the five miles
was 11-.oQ 1-5. the last mile being covered
in 2:14.

suit brought by John Aviward of Liver
more,
They outline the procedure by which
the water company was formed, and state
that they paid to improve the property
$10,600, and not $6000 as the complaint
states. They make an offer that, as an
evidence of their good faith, they are now

are positively denied, and it is stated that
the assessment of $10 a share was made at
a meeting of the stockholders in conform

and that all of the stockholders hare
paid the assessment except James Stan

made for the purpose of depriving Ayl

DURRANT ASKS
FOR A REHEARING
His Attorneys File Their
Petition in the Fa
mous Case.
They Use Very Strong Language
in Condemning the Jury
Impaneled.
Claim Made Tbat the Newspapers Had
the Defendant "Massacred"
Before His Tria".
Â».'â ; The petition for a rehearing in the case
of W. H. T. Durrani was filed Dy his at
toriney ; Eugene N. Deuprey and ' John H.
Dickinson, with the clerk of the Supreme
Court yesterday.' t The document is rather
voluminous, having been printed in pam
phlet form, and covers thirteen pages. ;
The first point submitted was that the
court had no power or authority to make'
a record which did not exist, and â  under
such circumstances supply a document in
order to authorize the proceeding with a
particular trial. 'â â 'Â .'â â¢'â¢
Aa regards the jurors it was asserted^
nothing unreasonable existed in requiring
that all should be on the i last preceding
assessmen c ; roll. A general r mary of
the unfitness of the ; jurors was summed
up in the following strong language:
V We again call the ' attention of this court to
the polut XV, pp. 92 to 96 inclusive, in rela
tion to this proposition, an <t transcript vol. 11,
fols. 2641 to 2650, from which ; record it will
be ; discovered mat "persons presented them
selves whose names had been selected for jury
service, fourteen of whom were non-residents,
twelve of whom were not citizens, tweive who
Jid not understand the English language, sev
eral were deaf, a number wore exempt fire
men, there were a number .incompetent from
old age, there were several professional I men,
several United states employes, several City
officials, a number of the militia aud a num
ber of Grand Jurors. :
None these were either suitable .or com
petent to act as jurors.; , -â¢ : â :
The Superior Court Judges were accused
of .failing ;to comply with t/*eir duty, by
failing to ; nrovide a competent panel of
jurors. The special venire was not. in the
opinion of Messrs. Deuprey and'Dickin
son, selected according to law, either.
. In relation to the action of tue court in
the cases of Jurors Crocker and Nathan it
was insisted that the detendant did not
have the privileges given him by the sixth
amendment to ' the ; constitution jof I toe
United States. "Under no circumstance,"
reads the petition, "should he be called
upon to waive the most sacred right in re
lation to his trial, viz. : â¢ in tbe selection of
jurors, by being forced to use peremptory
challenges when a challenge for cause is
plain and direct upon which the^court
should, with impartial mind, adjudicate."
Juror, Brown came in ior his little ver
bal dose also. "Juror Brown" in fact
has come to be a scere*otyped phrase in
discussine the Durrant trial. In his case,
it was argued "that the court did invade
i bis (defendant's) right to an impartial
trial by jurors."- â¢ . <
: v In commenting upon the attitude of the
public press toward the defendant during
the trial the petition asserts lhat in nfost
instances their stories were r ascertained , to
be fabrications. ;-^., : ;'u _:â  ]. .: ;.;.,..â , .
\l.. In ; conclusion, Deuprey and ; Dickinson
make an eloquent plea for a rehearing and
the privilege of oral argument in the fol
lowing language: ;
In regard to several of the questions passed
upon by this honorable tribunal in its opinion
in - affirming the judgment of the inferior
court, we j can ' call moro particular snd posi
tive attention ,by having the privilege of an
oral argument, and in the name of all that is
humane, of all that is just, of all that is fair in
an enlightened . age aud in an enlightened
coantry, we ueg and we prary that this court
will grant our application for a rehearing, and
in any event tbe privilege of an oral argument
before : finally - determining the application
now made on behalf ot one who is, as his coun
sel believe to be, innoceut of the awful crimes
now charged against him.

the City Prison yesterday afternoon on a

NEW YORK, N. V., March 23.-The market
for securities to-day was dominated by the deci
sion rendered yesterday by (he fniteJ States â -â u
preme Court in the Trans- Missouri Freight Asso
ciation case. ; Efforts were made during the morn
ing session to counteract the importance of this
decision by according support to certain of the
Vanderbilt stocks, and the bulls were assis ed by
a rise in Chicago Gas to Ihe best agures yet at
ta ned. the stock namea having been purchased
freely by prominent firms, la tb& belief that the
1! inois Legislature will shortly pass a bill to per
mit the constituent comDanies comprising the
Chicago Gas Company o on legal
grounds. As the day.progressed, however, operat
ors attached more and more importance to the
t-upreme Court decUion, winch is now reearded as
a severe blow to combinatious generally^ whether
railroad or Industrial, -...'.
As this view of the case became quite pro
nounced the selling pressure increased and during
the afternoon the stock market had a decidedly
depressed â  look, The downward movement was
. accelerated by continued repor in regard to the
floatin? debt of the New Jersey Central and us
leased companyâ the Lehigh and Wilkesbarreâ
icb, it was said, would lead to areductlon in the
Jersey Central dividend next month. ' The ad
vices from Washington to tho effect that the tariff
blli.accords less protection to the American Sucar
Rettnins Company ih n expected led to heavy
t-ellltiK of that stock and this, too, augment* d the
bearish ieei ni;. Tbe shrlnkuge In values'dls

CHICAGO, Ili-, March 23 âThe local specula
tive element was not quite as bearish on wheat
this morning as at the close yesterday. Liverpool
responded tooar decline by quoting IV*<J lost. The
receipts in the Northwest were heavy at 410 cars
against 250 last Tuesday and 705 a year ago. and
there was no war news to helD prices. The crowd
bad experienced a chance of heart over niirht and
the demand for wheat was in excess of offerings
so that after a fractional openiug decline, a rally
occurred. /Chicago received eighteen cars and in
spected out 49,3fc6 bushels. Bradstreet's report of
a decrease in the world's available suppl;* of 4.963.
--,000 bushels, bad weather West and a strong mÂ«r
jcei m St. Louis all combined to furnisb ncourage
ment later. Kxport clearances were moderate at
2-7,317 bushels. losing Continental cables were
all lower. May wheat Opened from 7i*4 â¢ to 72VaC.

C^KX-i'lie acdon o' th â¢ Corn market was simi

-lion and for Ind penden; reasons. Liverpool ca
bles were low<r, prices here diopping a fi action i;i
reaponse but quickly regaining the : ost prices.
Receipts were 222. cars ami 45,000 bushels were
taken from s ore. The stormy weather convoyed
some encouragement to buyer*. Bradstreet's re
purtert a decrease in the world's available supply
of 821,000 bushels. Export clearances were or
niou-t at 1,389,821 bushels. - May >. orn ; opened a

traries this morning. There was a very light run,
but for some r. ason the demand did not appear
urgent aid In consequence 5 cents i>er 100 pounds
was deducted from prices. The natural effect of this
decline was to weatiun product at the start. Im er
the constant stiength of grain communicated a
better feeling to provisions. May pork close 1 2Vic

She Hal Forty-One Finger* and Toes.
Little four-year-old May Hill is one of
the queerest human freaks in the matter
ol fingers and toes that a per-on sees iv a
life time. Sue was brought to Fort Worth
by her father, J. W. Hill, who, with her
mother, is carrying her bacfc to their
home in Cass County. The child has an
her left foot nine toes, one crowing from
the top of her foot, and on the right foot
eight toes. She has nine fincers and three
thumbs on the right hand, and seven
fingers and five thumbs on the left. Each
hand is dividert into two phalanges, each
containing several fingers. The thumbs
grow on the hand where one thumb of
normal persona grows. The fingers are
grown together lite webfeet. In all the
rirl has forty-one toes and fingers. â St.

TO SEEK REVENGE
Mrs. Douglass Denies the
Stories of Revolvers
and Murders.
While Not Pleased With Her
Ex-Husband She Craves
Seclusion.
Says That She Has Hid More No
toriety Than Her MoJesty
Can Appreciate.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, March 23. J
Mrs. George A. Douglas, whose husband
recently obtained a divorce because his
â wife thought more of horses than of him,
returned from Los Angeles this morning
and went to the home of her aunt in Fruit
vale, where she it now stopping.
All kinds of rumors preceded and suc
ceeded her arrival in Oakland, and all
were to the effect that she had come home
well equipped to take summary vengeance
on her late husband, because of certain
articles which have recently been published
reflecting upon her treatment of Mr. Doug
las during their married life.
f The articles referred to place Mrs. Doug
las in anything but an enviable light.
These stories of course reached Mrs. Doug
las in Los Angeles; acting on the impulse
of the moment she uttered some angry
expressions, which carried a meaning very
tiifrerent from that which she intended
t!iÂ«v should.
Her expressions of anger quickly
reached her old home and something sen-
Bational if not tragic was expected as soon
as it was known she had left Los Angeles
for Oakland
One of the stories circulated even went
so far as lo state that Mrs. Douglas was
returning armed with a revolver, for the
purpose of wreaking summary vengeance.
Mrs. Douglas was at the home of her
aunt this afternoon and stated that all
stories Bbout revolvers and ether sensa
tional things were unfounded. She saia
Bhe bad no revolver and had no intention
of killing her husband. "Although I
was not particularly pleased with the
manner in w. ich he is reported to
have spoken aoout me," she said, "I
am not paying any attention to the mat
ter. The reasons why we could not live
together were sufficiently explained at
the divorce trial, and I do not know of
anything that has developed since that
time. I was very much surprised to find
that Mr. D >uglas had permitted himself
to be interviewed for the purpose of mak
ing a sensational article, because it did
not reflect any more credit on him than
on me.
"I have no desire to go around with a
revolver on any such rtupid errand. Mr.
Douglas and I can both live in the same
world, provided we are not forced to live
together, and 1 think the best thing he
can do is to keep quiet. I certainly nave
had more notoriety than I apprec:ato."
DELANEY ON CORBETT.
The Well-Known Trainer Gives
Some Inside History of
the Ring.
He Says That Corbatt Took Advice
From Everybaiy and Went
Stale.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, )
SOS Broadway, March 23.)'
William Delaney, tbe trainer in chief of
the late champion James Corbett, has
been silent since leaving the ringside with
his defeated hero. This afternoon he con
sented to give his opinion as to why Cor
bett lost the battle of his life.
He blames the unluctcy result to the
fact that Corbett was headstrong and
would not heed the advics of his trainer,
and tells an interesting story of the diffi
culties that existed in regard to the train
ing of which nothing has hitherto been
said.
He stir. bates the defeat to the fact that
on the Sunday preceding the fight Corbett
was anxious to show how much he could
do in the presence of Muidoon, Al Smitn,
Billy Madden and other prominent New
York sport!. According to Daianey Cor
bett should have eased up on his training
for the three days before tlie fieht and the
failure to do this Virtually killed him.
"The Sunday before the tight," said
Delaney, "when (Jorbett should have been
resting he actually multiplied his work to
show off to his Eastern friends. He went
â¢ ut in tne morning and jogged ten miles.
In lUe afternoon lie punched the bag a
long time, boxed four rounds each with
Woods, Jeffries, McVey and his brother
j oc â tne hardest kind of boxing, too. He
kepi this up the next day and even tne
day before the tight he would not let up.
AH this was contrary to my instructions,
ldid not sanctiou it, but ne would not
pay any attention to my advice. AH
uiong I opposed his handball playing. He
liked that form of training because he
could beat those whom he met, but I told
him it was no good for him. It is too
latiguing for a greyhound like Jim. It is
good enough for a fat fellow, and that is
all. i told his brother long be'ore the
tight that if I had not been afraid of being
caught I would have burned down the
court and ste pped bis work in it.
"Another ining I disapproved of was
that he wouldn't touch liquor in any
shape. Some one had given him that
tneory ana he wouldn't take a bottle of
ale or a glass of champagne, although I
wae telling him ne needeu some malt to
supply the drain on his system by his
hard work. To give you an idea of the
mistake be was making, the night before
the fight when he came in from the ten
mile run he was as dry as a bone, though
he should have been bathed in perspira
tion. Why, Fitzsimmons for the four
days previous to ihe right was riding
around in a buggy with his wife and was
taking a drink uptown every time Â»ac
wanted to. As to which man was right in
i is ideas I will leave the fact of the con
dition of the two men in the ring.
"I want to say right here that when a
man goes into a ring for a finish fignt not
knowing how lone he will be there lie
ahculd have some superfluous flesh. It is
a fact that a man will lose five pounds in
the course of anything like a good fUht.
Jiifl, therefore, should have bsen prepared
for thif, instead of which, by training
down to the very last minute, be did not
have an extra ounce of flesh on his bones.
â¢'The morning of the fight I was a little
bit afraid of the ouicome, but still I
tboueht J-im would win, because I figured
that, even though be was not in the con
dition lie oneht to bo, he was more than a
match for FMzsimrnons. After the fight
started, jiiough, I trot scared. He was
hitting Fitz all the time, but was not hurt
ing him oaiily, and 1 could see that there
was no steam or vitality to his blows. In
the fourth round Uiily Brady, who was in
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
our corner, said to me: 'How do you like
it?"
"'I don't like it af all,' I replied. 'I
think we are up against it.'
"In the round where Fitz was down,
Jim mieht have won, but he stood right
over Fitz and wouldn't giva him a chance
to eet up. Jim should have sterpsd back
seven or eight feet, but instead ue stood
over Fiiz waiting tor him to rise, and the
referee had to push him away. Had Jim
â¢tooii away, in the first place, Fitz woui'd
have got tip much quicker and Jim would
have had a chance to pet a few more
punches at him, and might have pot
him out.
"In the tenth round Jim was tiring, and
I told him he was in for an all-day fizht.
He was very confident then and said that
he would win. I objected to the incessant
talking he kept up In his corner. There
were a couple of his friends there wno
wanted to talk with him, and Jim, instead
of taking every opportunity to breathe,
was conversing with tueni.
"As regards the result, I want to aay
thai Fitz didn't win on any fluke. Jim
mn't ri^ht any better than he did, and
Fiiz is entitled to all the credit in the
world. Jim shouldn't nave melted away
in the manner he did after the sixtn
round, and it was all due to the shape he
was in. He was hitting F.tz often
enough, but not hard enough. I have
seen him with a pair of eight-ounce gloves
bring Jeffries to his knees with a blow,
and I don't think Fitz can stand a harder
punch than Jeffrie?, who is a veritable
young giant.
"The difference between Fitz3immons
and Corbett is that Fitz never loses his
hitting powers. He can always hit at the
right time and in the right place. Fitz
displayed more generalship than I have
ever seen in the ring. I don't think: the
two men will ever tight again.
"What Corbett should do is to fight
every one who wants to meet him for
from four to ten rounds, and I want to
say if he can't lick those other fellowsâ
Maher, Choynski, Goddard and Sharkey â
he can't whip Fitz~immons.
*'I do not consider that I trained Jim
.for this fight. I did for all his winnine
ones, but this time there were a couple of
men there â I won't mention their name? â
who could make him eat standing un his
head U they wanted him to. I have not
feen Jim since the day of the fight, nor
have I heard from him. I picked him up
in the ring after t n knockout and got
him on his legs. When he started to go
for Fitz after that I told him to let up
and not be foolish. I was with him after
ward in his dressing-room and went to
the depot to see him off. That is the last
I have had to do with him."
Must Have Oakland at Heart.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 23.â Auditor
Snow doi s not think that the city's money
should be paid to parties having no in
terests in Oakland's welfare. Wlien the
nppropriat on was made last year to pay
Dr. J. T. McLean Mr. Snow refused to
draw the warrant in his favor, but made it
payable to A. H. Rose, president of the
River and Harbor Improvement Associa
tion, the organization to which the appro
priation was made.
'"I held off drawing the warrant," ex
plained Mr. Snow to-day, "not because of
any le.-al right to refuse payment, but be
cause I objected to the idea, as a citizen,
that an Alameda man, who was in favor
of completing ti.e tidal canal before
dredginc Oakland harbor, should be paid
by the city oi Oakland.
"I asked what Alameda proposed doing,
and was told that that c;tv would wait for
some action from the Board of Super
visors. I then said I would wait until I
had seen what was going to be done be
fore drawing the warrant. I was inter
viewed by a number of men, who were in
terested in the matter, and I got a sacred
promise that Dr. McLean, or whoever
went to Washington, would work lor the
whole harbor improvement, before the
warrant was drawn."

Joyce was awarded $216 80 to-day by
Justice Clift in nis suit against Mrs. M. L.
Chandler, Mrs. E. H. Langand and Mrs.
M. S. Schuflin. The ladies were formerly
president, secretary and treasurer of the
Alameda County Midwinter Fair Girls'
Flag Brigade. Three years ago this or
ganization made a great stir here. The
children, 250 strong, beautifully dressed
in red, white and blue, were preparing to ]
maKe a big showing at the county day at I
the fair, when suddenly it was found that
the money paid to the treasurer had not
settled the bills. Then resignations one
after another came and the organiza
tion went to pieces. Suit was instituted
at once and judgment entered to-day.
Will Go to lieulah.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 24, 1897.
GALA DAY FOR
THE UNIVERSITY
Berkeley's Twenty- Ninth
Birthday Fittingly
Celebrated.
Speeches by Dr. Joseph Ls Conte,
Hon. Wiliiam R. Davis and
J. A Elstcn.
Or. Le Conte Traces the Sources of
Truth and Social Advancement to
Science and Evolution.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 23. â The
twenty-ninth anniversary of the birth of
the State University was celebrated this
morning in the Harmon Gymnasium. It
was the twenty-first celebration of the
kind thai has taken place at Berkeley.
President Kellogg presided, and with
him on the platform were: Hon. Wil
liam R. Davis, president of the Alumni
Association, and Professors Hilcard,
Lange, Bradley, Wickson; Regent J. W.
Martin, Regent Denicke, Colonel Ed
wards, Dr. Le Conte, and J. A. Elston '97,
president of the Associated Students.
Elston was the first speaker. He spoke
of tbe student body. He told of the
growth of student sentiment and customs
and deprecated JBourdo. celebrations,
as now carried out, as "senseless extrava
gance." He favored a strong student sen
timent in favor of rules of propriety in
college life and urged that such a state of
affairs would come about as a natural
growth as the university becomes older.
Hon. William R. Davis was then iutro
duced and spoke in part as lollows:
One of the sons of the university, I take to
day tlie point of view of an observer. This
does not mean a lading of the old devotion,
but the acquiring of a newer and broader one.
From the observer's point of view we see the
University of California in three aspects:
First, In time; second, in its scope; third, in
the State.
In time, it has six stages. The conception of
Durant, Kellogg and the faithiul band of fore
runners who from the beginning foresaw and
proclaimed in the wilderness that civilization
is greater than gain. The next stage was
reached in 1808, when the State founded ihe
university in law by the act of March 23, 1868.
That is the day we celebrate. The thud stage
was the embodying of the university in the
constitution in 1879, and a > art of the organi
zation and lhe of the State.
The fourth stage was the passage of the per
petual tax act of 18J39â the turning of special
acts of appropriation to the fixed purpose of
perpetual support. The fifth, now upon us, is
the building era. And tne sixth staee in
time Is the passace of the act of 1897, by
which the policy of permanent support has
been confirmed. These six stages denote em
bodiment and demonstrate growth.
Let us make no mistake; It is the State, the
commonwealth that is the end, not the schools
of this or riiv land; it is man that is the end,
not science or philosophy; it is the uplifting of
the race that is the end, not human knowl
edge.
Dr. Joseph Le Conte, the veteran sci
entist, was then presented and spoke for
over an hour on the true idea of a univer
sity as he conceived it. For the elabora
tion of his address he drew upon science,
religion, art, philosophy and evolution,
concluding with the idea that science has
come n..t to destroy, but to fulfill. He
also told of the characteristic defects of
the English and German universities and
contrasted them with the universities of
America. In making this comparison he
said:
The American university has two distinctive
features. They are the ciose union of the col
lege and the university and the full recogni
tion of the professional schools. The real
trouble with our American universities is that
the rush for practical life is so very urge nt
that there is a strong tendency in the scien
tific departments to crowd back the profes
sional courses into the undergraduate, and in
the traditonal professions of law and medi
cine to dispense with the college course en
tirely.
Science 5s so recent and its course so rapid,
there is such an accumula:ion of new mate
rial and such a fermenting of ueiv ideas, that
there has not yet been time enough for organ
ization into rational knowledge, which is
philosophy. Intellectual food Is gathered and
digested so fi.st that there is no time for di
gestion, assimilation and incorporation into
our essential human nature.
HUNTING HER ENEMY.
San Francisco Wife Attacks a Clerk
for Ala-king Her Husband
Presents.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 23.â Miss Kate
Murphy, a window-dresser in the store of
Abrahamson Bros., was attacked by an
THE Y. M. C. A. TEAM OF TUMBLERS.
infuriated married woman of San Fran
cisco last evening and but for the timely
interference o! one of her employers
would undoubtedly have suffered severe
injuries. She was engaged in dressing a
window when a Mrs. Landgreves rushed
into the store an l attempted to drac her
out into tne street. Mr. Abrahamson in
terfered an>l told them that they must
settle their difficulty elsewhere.
Mrs. Landgreves and a companion
named Saunders were taken into the pri
vate office and there they told their
story. The former charged Miss Murphy
with alienating her husband's affections
and exhibited a number of handkerchiefs
and neckties which she said she found in
her truant husband's pockets. She
claimed mat they came from Miss Mur
phy. On making an examination Mr.
Abrahamsnn found that the articles had
been purchased on the dates civen by
Mr-. Landgreves by Miss Murohy in the
store. This morning Miss Murphy was
discharged.
The two women upon leaving the store
called upon Chief of Police Lloyd, where
Mrs. Landgreves repeated hrr story and
demanded Miss Murphy's arrest. Her
request was den ed, but as she started to
leave the office a huge butcher-knife fell
from the folds of her dress. She left
swearing that sne would be revenged.
Miss Murphy was not at home to-night.
Give the Needy Work.
OAKLAND. Cal., March 23.â The quar
terly meeting of the Associated Charities
was held last evpning in the Asbury M. E.
Church. Mrs. Kelly, the superintendent,
opposed indiscriminate alms-giving, and
explained the work of the association by
saving:
One ereat aim is to give work to those
who apply, thus making them feel that
they are not dependent, but are earning
what they receive. Hence, through the
empoyment bureau work has been found
for fifty persons. Three men, six women
and three girls found permanent work,
and twenty-five men and thirteen women
worked seventy-two and a quarter days.
Out of the fifty employment cards sent
out those returned showed that the sum
of $95 50 had teen earned for day's work.
Two hundred and forty-six meal and 165
lodging tickets were returned by the
1 arties receiving the same from private
houses. During the quarter fifty-three
prominent citizens have become members
of the Associated Charities.
Persons are requested to refer all able
bodied men asking aid to the woodyard of
the charitable organization, and women
and children to the general office of the
society, room 7, Enqnirer building.
The report of the manager of the wood
yard showed that, for the period lrom Sep
tember 21. 1896, to March 20, 1897, the
total number of rren who have worked in
the yard was 1906; largest number on any
day, 27; smallest number on any day, 3;
average number per day, 12; total num
ber of meal tickets issued, 2120; of lodging
ticsetfl issued, 42; of grocery orders is
sued, 65; of cords of wood cut, 103%; of
ferry tickets, 56.
Allegations for the Contest.
OAKLAND, Cau, March 23. â The
papers in the Mayoralty contest will be
filed Thursday. They will charge that in
a large number of cases tne election
officials were not on the assessment rolls â
twenty-two out of thirty-two in the weÃt
end of town being in error in this way.
Although the law provides that these
j officials shall be chosen from the two par
ties having the highest number of votes
at the preceding election, this was also
disregarded and the officials chosen in
main from one body.
The most important allegation is that
persons other than tho election officials
handled the ballots and tally - sheets.
These charges will get the case into court,
but the main issue will rest with the re
count. Provided the irregularities were
proven, the loss would fall as heavily
upon one side as the other. The contest
will cost from $15 to $20 per day and take
the larger part of a week.
Filled With Boarders.
OAKLAND. Cal.. March 23.â The
friends of Mrs. E. H. Pardee wilt be sur
prised to learn that she has turned the
commodious homestead at Castro and
Eleventh streets into a boarding-house.
Of course it is a very exclusive house, and
already the place has all mat it can ac

ALAMEDA COUNTY
TAXES STAND
Powers of the Board of
Equalization Exactly
Defined.
The Supreme Court Reverses the
Decision in Favor of E
G. Euswell.
Property Assessments for 1805 96 Must
Remainâ Cal ed a Technical
Attack
An important decision was rendered
yesterday in the matter of tho assessments
of Alameda County for 1895-96 by the
Board of Supervisors, in which the in
creases and reductions ordered by the
board are sustained, as well as the rights
of Boards of Equalization to extend the
limit of their sittings.
The case decided was that of E. G. Bos
well against the Board of Supervisors.
He is a taxpayer of Alameda County.
The Political Code, section 3672, pro
vides that the Boards of Supervisors of
the various counties shall sit as Boards of
Equalization from the first to the third
Monday of July. No section of the code
provides that the County Board of Equali
zation shall be permitted to extend its
sessions beyond the third Monday of July
by securing permission from the State
Board of Equalization.
The first Monday of July, 1895. fell upon
the Ist of the mouth, and the third Mon
day upon the 15th. . The Assessor of Ala
meda County had turned his assessment
books over to the Board of Equalization,
and finding that it would not be able to
complete its labors tho county board ap
plied to the State board and received a
twenty days' extension af time.
The State Board of Equalization was not
in session at that time, but the secretary
gave the desired permission.
On the :>sth of July the County Board of
Equalization made an order reducing
assessments to the amount of about one
and a half million dollars.
Buswell brought suit against the Super
visors to compel them to accept the assess
ment roll as given by the Assessor, and tp
restrain tnem from permitting the reduc
tion in the assessment ordered July 25.
The lower court decided in favor oi Bus
well. The only point in controversy was
as to whether or not the act of the secre
tary of the State Board of Equalization
was valid.
Section 3885 of the Political Code pro
vides: "No assessment or act relating to
assessment or collection of taxes is illegal
on account of informality, nor because the
same was not completed within the time
required by Jaw."
The Supreme Court held that the attack
of the plaint fÂ£ was purely technical, and
while t. c State Board of Equalization did
not give its consent authoritatively, and
while this authority could not be d-le
gated to the secretary, it holds that sec
tion 3SSS should be considered as reaching
the case in its entirety.
Accordingly judgment was reversed ana
the cause remanded.
BERKELEY MEETS DEFEAT.
Alameda Alert* Vanquish the UniTer-
â ity Nine by a Score of
Twelve to .Eight.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 23 âThe
University baseball nino met their Water
loo this afternoon at the hands of tho
Alameda Alerts, losing a hotly contested
game to the latter by a score of 12 to 8.
Up to the beginning of the fifth inning
things were in Berkeley's favor.
Neither team had its best players on
deck. Hennesey was gone from Berke
ley's first base and Krug from third, and
McKee was substituted for Moslcimon in
the box because of an injury to the lat
ter's hand. Tliongh the runs were in
favor of the Alerts, the summary ap
pended will show somewhat of an advan
tage in favor of Berkeley from the point
of view of accurate baseball.
Following were the players and their

5:30 thi3 morning. The "-ophs" were

way, aud the result was so one-sided that
they have little to gloat over. To-night

was framed at the last meeting, and which
provides for a considerable reduction in
ti e current rates, was passed to jirint. In
opposition to the proposed reduction, tho
watÂ«r company presented a statement to
the effect that the cost of placing the
hydrant", pipes and other appurtenances
desired by the town, as a consideration
for re-estab isning the old rates, would be
between $45 000 and $50,000 and would
exhaust the entire income ot the ousiness.
It was stated that even the old rates did
not provide a proper income for the com
pany and that the board in fixing rates
had no right to regard as untrue the com
pany's statement until it was proved false.
The ordinance was put through, notwith
standing the opposition on the part of the
company.

DYNAMITE IN GARBAGE.
Attempt to Blow Up the New
Crematory in Oak
land.
Supposed to Be the Result cf the
Troub'e Between the Scaven
gers and Contractors-
Oakland Offick San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 23. )
There was a sensation at the meeting of
thn Board of Health to-night when Sec
retary Schaffer produced some sticks of
dynamite that were intended to blow up
the new garbage crematory.
The dynamite was found in some of the
garDage that had been delivered at the
crematory to be burned, but as all tbe
refuse is dumped in a heap it is not pos
sible to tell who is the guilty party.
Ever since tbe crematory made the con
tract -with the city to destroy all <he gar
bage there ha 3 been trouble with the
scavengers, as it takes away a portion of
their profit. Before tbe passage of the
ordinance forbidding the damping of the
garbage within the city limits the scav
engers hauled their loads to the marshes
and dumped where they pleased. They
refused for several days to collect any
garbage and afterward they tr.ad to damp
it at night. Then they made all the
trouble possible at the crematory and ob
j.>cted to the price they had to pay to
nave the refuse destroyed.
For the past few days everything has
been quiet, but yesterday one of the at
tendants at tbe crematory discovered sev
eral sticks of dynamite in the garbage.
There was enough to wreck a dozen cre
matories had it got into the furnace.
The Board of Health was asked by the
crematory people to take some action in
regard to the dynamite, but they decided
that they had no jurisdiction and recom
mended that the matter be referred to the
police.

WILL REMOVE ALL
UNUSED RAILS
Mayor Phelan Has Called
an Important Con
ference.
Miles of Useless Streetcar Track
to Be Done Away With
at One?.
If ti;e Companies Will Not Act the
City Willâ Stockton Street
Rails Torn Up.
Mayor Phelan, assisted by the property
owners of this City, intends to make a de
termined effort to remove all of the unused
â treet-railway tracks that now cumber the
streets of this C:ty, and to this end sn
important conference has been called, at
which the matter will be discussed.
Some time ago Mayor Phelan began to
investigate the matter of unused car
tracks, because of complaints from prop
erty-owners, and Jearued that there were
several miies of them in San Francisco.
Then he called upon Superintendent of
Streets Ambrose to state the exact local
ity and extent of the idle rails. The mas
ter of the streets enumerated them as
follows:
Army street, from Bryant to San
Bruno road.
Potrero avenue, from Tpn-h street to
Twenty -fourth.
Fell street, from Market to Franklin,
thence on Franklin to Oak, thence on
Oak to Stanyan.
Stockton street, from Ellis to Geary.
Stockton street, from Post to Geary.
Post street, from Stockton to Geary.
Broderick street, from Oak to Â£1111,
thence to Devisadero.
ICllts street, from Devlsadero to Hyde.
. Intersection of Turk and Market
Streets.
Taylor street, from Golden Gate ave
nue to Goary street.
' ) uÂ«h street, from Battery to westerly
termination.
Twelfth street, from Mission to Mar
ket.
ISrannan street, from Third to Eighth.
Tenth street, from Howard to Potrero
avenue.
Twenty-fifth street, from Utah to Ne
braska.
Fell street, from Baker to Devisadero.
Stanyan street, from Haight to Frede
rick.
Market street, from Sixth to Eighth.
Eighth street, from Market to Folsom.
After ascertaining by whom the various
tracks were laid the Mayor wrote to each,
requesting a conference at an early date.
He will point out to the companies the
laws wt.icti require the use of tracks to
render franchises valid and will ask the
owners to either use the rails or taite
them up. In the evc'nt of failure or re
fusal to do this the Board of Supervisors
will be requested to order the rails sum
marily removed, as was done in the ense
of Stockton street, from Ellis to O'Far
rell.
Superintendent of Streets Ambrose
made short wort of toe track mentioned
yesterday morning. He was not aware
until 9 o clock that he had been in
structed by the board to tear up the rails,
but when the matter came to his ears he
acted with decision and dispatch.
Within an hour fifty laborers were as
sembled on the ground and a vigorous
application of picks and crowbars soon
raised the raiis from their ancient bed.
They were carried to tho curbstone and
later to the Corporation Yard.
At a laic hour Mayor Phelan received
a request from the railroad company to
have the raiis carted to the railroad shop?,
and he consented that this be done, pro
vided the company would agree not to
put them back whence they were taken.
"It is hish time tliis nuisance and eye
â ore of idle rails cumbering the City
streets was done away with," said Mayor
Pbelan.
"The laws governing the franchises
under which the companies operate con
template tne active use of the rails and the
abandonment and removal of the tracks
when they ate past tneir days of service.
San Franc ; sco must keep up with the
march of progress, and it cannot do so
when such practices are allowed to go on.
The City government will conler within a
few days with the companies and try to
reach some amicable arrangement, regard
ing the removal of the rai.s. If tne com
panies do not come to our way of think
ing then the only remedy is to tase them
up ourse!ve<-."
STUDENTS' NIGHT.
Music, Exhortation and Basket Ball
Drew a Large Crowd to Y. 81. C. A.
Auditorium.
Students nre house-fillers, and that is
why the Y. M. C. A. Auditorium was
crowded from the stage to the doors last
evening, for it was students' night. Well
known people took part iv the pro
gramme, and it was difficult to decide
whether the music or the speaking was
tiie better feature.
Louis Titus opened with a welcome to
the young men an>t an invitation to join
the association. President Kellogs of the
University of California made an address,
in which he encouraged the students to
walk along the line of morality and be
good boys.
Singing Evangelist Ira D. Sankey made
his hearers laugh and cry by turns with
humorous and ia:hetic anecdotes which
fitted the subject of liis remarks as neatly
as though they had been made for the oc
casion. He sang a song with a moral and
an encore, tne first of which he pointed
and the second of wiiich he granted.
Miss El zabeih F. Uartlett E av6 several
readings, which she was obliged to repeat.
The Knickerbocker Male Quartet was in
line voice and Mag with unwonted ex
pression and spirit, being preeted again
and again with encores. The selections
were the best in their repprioire, includ
ing "Sally in Our Alley," "There Was an
Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe" and
Brahms "Lullaby." The members of the
quartet-are: I>. Al. Lawrence, first tenor;
V. M. Elliott, sÂ«"-ond tenor; D. B. Crane,
first bass, and L. A. Larsen, second bass.
After the entertainment the visiiors
were treattd io a game of basket-ball in
the gymnasium between the 'Â»7's of Ban
Fianci-co and the Cvclcne? Nt Oakland.
The teams were: Walter Keys, J. A.
Percy, H. B. Ward, F. T. Finch, C. S.
Jurger", W. D. Dehayand C. T. Pfnrrer in
the '97's, and A. LauÂ«tern, K. A. Kerr, E.
C. Gilbert, Charles Zein, E. C. Brown,
Edward E. Lyon and Herman Vockel of
the Cyclones. The umpires were George
Kiarm and Frank Uoeic; referee, Rudolph
Horn^r; timekeeper, F. M. Gooiinch, and
eoorers E. J. Ziska and H. Guittard.
The game w;ts won by the Oaklands
vith a score of 11 io 2.
Gritdy Mayhem Case.
Justice of the Peace Carroll will hold the
preliminary examination of Attorney \V. D.
Orndy, charged with mayhem, next Monday
afternoon at 2 o'clock. He is accused of biting
off tlie ear of William Schaffer, a waiter in tbe
Orpheum Annex. The case was assigned to
Judge Joachimsen's court, but after several
weeks Grady asked for a ( hmiee of venue, and
now as none of the Police Judges will have it
the services of Justice of the Peace Carroll
have been brought into requisition.

SWIMMING AND DIVING.
Amateur Athletes Have Arranged for a
Scries of Natatorial
Contests.
The Pacific Athlectic Association has
decided to hold its annual swimming
championship races on the evenings of
April 20 and 21 at Lurline baths. There
are to be seven races in all, which will
terminate with an exhibition of fancy div
ing. The events are 50, 75, 100, 220 and 440
van!', half mile and one miie races.
Thrte association medals, one of gold and
two of silver, are to be awarded to the
winners.
Regarding the trouble which has been
engendered between the Western Inter
collegiate Association and the Amateur
Athetic Union, a vote was taken among
the delegates to the Wesiern Intercolle
giate Association, which resulted in favor
of severing all connection with the Ama
teur Athletic Union. Thi* is the out
come of the refusal of the union to allow
the Intercollegiate Association athletes
to compete in games without registering
tlieir names. But tie withdrawal of the
colleges does not affect the standing of
the Pac'fic Athletic Association with the
Amateur Athletic Union.

LAND HO!
FOR LABOR
Booth- Tucker's Plan for
Helping the Poor in
Cities.
VEGETABLES TO GROW
ON VACANT LOTS.
Hrmiculture as a Substitute for
the Degraded Chain
gang.
LABORERS WILL BE TAUGHT
AGRICULTURE.
Rousing Salvation Army Meeting in
Metropolitan Temple for the
Benefii of the Poor.
Commander Booth- Tucker spoke to a
Call reporter with great enthusiasm yes
terday on h.s project to put the unem
ployed at remunerative labor. His scheme,
he said, was for the permanent relief of
the poor rather than lor cases of tempr
rary emergency. At the same time, when
the temporary emergency arises the Sal
vation Army has all the machinery for
handling it on a large scale. The com
mander added:
"In New York City we fed and sheltered
3000 people every night for a fortnight
during the cold and bitter weather. In
the city of Detroit alone we distributed
clothing and groceries costing $200,009 in
three months. The citizens co-operated
splendidly with us there.
"Under the present condition of things
the honest man is turned into a rogue and
the hard-working man is made lazy.
When Â«t man says, 'I cannot earn my own
living,' then society has a right to say,
'You shall get your living,' and drive him
out upon a piece ol land. Our remedy is
briefly to form city colonies as a tempo
rary expedient to enable ns to sort out
the worthy and willing, and, having done
that, we turn oar eyes to the land and
endeavor to guide immigration from the
city to the country. 1 have coined a word
w Inch seems to fit the case. It is 'homi
cu.ture' â the cultivation of men.
"I propose to effect this object in three
or four ways. First, by arranging a course
of lectures to City workingmen and the
masses wlio attend our meetings, delivered
in the most attractive manner possible,
with stereopticon view* and music. We
propose to give away plants and roots for
the people to grow in pots on their win
dow-sills, with the intention of implant
ing in the minds of the people a knowl
edge of the uses of land and a love of
nature, together with a praciical knowl
edge of aericulture.
"In connection with thai work we will
get the owners of vacant lots in and
around the City who are holding their
lands for speculative purposes to lend
them to us for the use of workingmen in
the City â not so much those who are out
of work altogether, but we take them be
fore .they get absolutely out of work. W T e
catch him before he is reduced to his last
cent, when he is earning but a bare living
and whan at any moment he is liable to
be turned out of bis employment. We
let him and his wife raise vegetables on
this land, not for the purpose of selling
but of eating them.
"This will be of great educational ad
vantage to them. They and their chil
dren get to know and to like the land.
You say to them after th*y have reached
that point : 'There is a five-acre lot twenty
or thirty miles outside the City and by
paying out of your earnings a dollar a
week you can become the owner of it.
The land is fenced, the plants are in, a
cow and some chickens an there all ready
for you and you can walk right in. You
don't need to give up your job in the City,
but send your wife and children there arid
pay us $1 a week.'
"I want it to be a business proposition,
not a charitable one, but something which
will return a reasonable percentage of in
terest. It will be necessary to establish
a fund of fJO.OOO or $.3,000, for with a
small amount you can accomplish a great
deal. We will bond a tract of land and
buy it ns we are able to develop it. It
must be eood soil which will yield a re
turn for the work put into it. Bad land is
dear even if it cosi.s nothing.
"Let some of the business gentlemen of
this City risk yoniethinc for once for the
10-ve of God 10 help their fellow man, ana
if they desire they can have ihe manage
ment of it, They will be in a position to
get 5 or 6 per cent interest.
"In addition to that I want to utilize
the existing ranches by telling the pro
prietors that we will help them to find
men from the cities who are suitable to
work on their places â not the riff-raff, but
men in whom you can place reliance. In
addition to their wages they should be
â¢_-iven a little bit of laud and it' possible
board and lodging. They should say to the
men, 'Come with your Wive> and children
and Fettle here,' and allow each man dur
ing good behavior the use of three or
five acres where he can grow whÃt he
likes. That will prove a stepping-stone
out of the misery of the streets."
Commander Booth Tucker called on
Mayor Phelan yesterday by appointment
and explained to the City's chief execu
tive the plan of the system he hopes to in
augurate. The Mayor was deeply inter
ested in the matter and asked many ques
tions, showing that be is thoroughly up
to-date on the business outlook of such a
proposition.
He promised Booth Tucker all the as
sistance possible in carrying out the plan.
The Mayor is also mucti interested in
the Pingree plan for aiding the unem
ployed, which is named after Governor
Pingree of M:chi an, who originated it
and demonstrated itsfeasbnity at Detroit,
Mich. In the Eastern city 421 acres
were tilled by several hundred unem
ployed or persons who were only partially
employed. nnd the result was that out of an
outlay of $2400 for seed and other matters
that had to be paid for there was a net
profit of $28.595 during 1896. The crop wag
in the main potatoes.
Such a scheme for helping the unem
ployed and utilizing idle city and private
laud may be tried when the boulevard is
finished.
Mayor Phelan thinks that the proposed
driveway should be disposed of first.
AT METROPOLITAN TEMPLE.
The Army Indorses Booth-Tucker's
Plan to Colonize.
The Saivation Army mass-meeting at
Metropolitan Temple held in honor of
Booth-Tucker and his proposition for peo
pling the vacant lands near the City
with the surplus population was largely
attended, and the audience indorsed both
the commander and the proposition.
There was a good deal of Salvation Army
enthusiasm in the beginning, led by Lieu
tenant Keppel before be introduced the
chairman of the evening, William M.
fhe Salvation Army Plan to a Emp T oy the Unemployed "as Explai ned by the Commander-in-Chief.
Bunker. Mr. Bunfcer on assuming the
chairmanship spoke in part as follows:
Fellow-citizens and friends, we are hereto
help the homeless and lift the hopele.-s to a
higher plane. We are not here from a mere
sense of duty. We are here because we wanted
to ba here." And glad we are that are
here.
Hard times have besieged the people, press
ing poverty has pressed harder than ever and
sickness and suffering have been felt on every
hand; but now, thank r.od, the siege is raised,
and in the distance we seem to heir that
famous cry, "Dinna ye hear the slogan ? The
Campbells are coniingl" The Salvation Army
is to the fore ami all is well.
We know that in these times happiness is
not the proper thins, thai it is bad form, out
of date and plebei n. but as it suits us to be
happy and try to make others happy, we will
rejoice and be exceeding glad. Who nas bet
ter cause for general rejoicing? Aro we not
fathering a glorious movement â a movement
for permanent prosperity ? Mark the distinc
tion â permanent prosperity! Any movement,
public or private, that simply alleviates the
suffering ot the poor is a makeshift, an emer
gency necessity, one of a dozen social ills the
coudittoiis force upou us.
In planning homes lor the homeless, or,
rather, in so planning that the homeless may
get homes for themselves, the army is true to
its principles and fighting for the right. It
rests its cause on the crucial test of utility.
Is it useful? Does it meet material needs?
These are questions it asks and answers.
Satisfied that it is right, thnt it has a blessing
for mankind, it dashes at the problem ol pov
erty wi'.h the living force of truth.
Booth-Tucker was then introduced and
waÂ« received with a "volley."
He said: "We came here as practical
sociologists; we deal with the problem of
the homeless in a fashion that is likely to
bring relief most speedily. We believe it
is the business of the Lord's and the busi
ness of the Salvation Army to look after
the homeless. We regret that we are not
able to do ten thousand times raoro good
than we are doing, but we are on the road
toward doing more and mora.
"We are criticized from some quarters
because we do not give aid for nothing to
all who apply becausa we have donations
given to us for the purpose. I can illus
trate to you readily how impossible it
would be for us to do the great work we
are now doing if we did it that way. If
we did not require them to help them
selves a little wo could oniy help 200 where
we now help 2JOO. Besides we don't be
lieve men with manliness in them want it
that way. Since I was here I have trav
eled over a great part of the country and
talked with prominent men everywhere,
legislators, leaders, and newspapermen in
a 1 the cities.
"There are abont 4.000.0Q0 people in this
country who are receiving aid in some
fashion, or who are in need of it. We
must grapple with this problem. I had
hoped that here it would not present
itself in such proportions as elsewhere,
but I find tnat you have the same trouble
as afflicts the rest of the world. If we
undertake the.remedy noon specific lines,
I think it may be met efficiently. I speak
humbly, but I have the advantage of
having studied tne question in the places
of the older civil-za'ions, not only London,
but in the great cities of the Continent,
where the prcblÂ»m is in its most aggra
vated form, and Legislatures and writers
look forward gloomily into the luture."
The speaker then outlined the plan,
which has been given in tne report of his
meeting with the members of the Cham
ber of Commerce. Briefly, it is to inaugu
rate the "Pingree plan' 1 of cultivating the
vacant Jots of the City, and then to secure
a laree tract of Innd near the City where
small houses could be built, the tract
being divided into live and ten acre lots
and colonized, the little farms being
properly stocked and sold upon install
ments of $1 per month, with interest at 5
per cent. He held this to be a simple and
entirely feasib:e plan for permanent relief
of the congested population ot' the citiei.
The meeting concluded with singing and
prayer.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 24, 1897.
SHE WON HER BET
ON FITZSIMMONS
Miss Daisy Doud Secured
Keeper Cashin's Long
Hair.
Lots of Fun Over the Payment
of a Bet on the Farallones
Yesterday.
It Was a Cas3 of a Fne Hiai of Hair
Versus a New Suit cf the Best
Underc othit g
The echo of the Corbett-Fitzsimmons
fight has reached the Faraliones. Wbile
separated from the Golden Gate by a
stretch of thirty-two miles of sea, otill
the news of ihe doings of the gladiators
was received at weekly intervals. When
the last papers reached tbc island it looked
as though Corbett was a sure winner.
Nevertheless, Miss Daisy Doud, the
new "schoolmarm" on the island, had no
faith in the pompadour, and so expressed
herself. The lightkeepers were firm fol
lowers of Jim, and each and all ot them
were willing to wager a month's salary
against Mi-*s Daisy's glove that the Cali
fornian would win.
Miss Doud was game, however, and
called at le*st one of ti.e men down. Ed
Cashin, the chief assistant keener, was
her chief tormentor, and she got "even
with him." '"You think Corbett will win,"
said she. ''Well, I'll bet you a new suit
of underclothes, a new shirt and a new
collar and necktie against your head of
hair."
Now, Cashin's hair is the pride of the
Faralione station and he thought twice
before he accepted the offer. After think
ing the matter over and reading the Ex
aminer's account of the condition of the
men, he came to the conclusion that he
could not lose, and made the bet.
That bot was his undoing and now he
is as "bald as a badger." When the news
of Fiizsiniraons' victory reached the
rocky island Gashin was reading "Trilby"
and dreaming about Little BUhe and
some of the other characters. He had a
rude awakening I owever. Chief Keeper
William Beeman, Captain "Gill" Brokaw
of the tug Reliance and two or three
others appeared on t le scene and aroused
Cashin from his reverie.
Miss Doud showed him a copy of The
Call which chronicled the defeat of Cor
bett and at once demanded her "pound
of flesh." The gallant light-keeper made
all kinds of excuses and finally refused
point blank to give up his abundant crop
of hair. It was a case of "willy nilly" as
Captain Beeman, Captain Brokaw of the
Reliance and two other of the men on the
island wore in attendance. Cashin was
strapped into a chair and Captain Beeman
did the barber's work.
As soon as the luxuriant growth was
cut snort Miss Doud was called for and a
well-sharpened razor was handed to her.
It was wonderful the change that came
over Cashin. Where before he had been
fighting at every clip made by the scissors,
he was now as quiet as a lamb. He didn't
even wince when his scalp was lathered,
and twenty minutes later when his scalp
was as clean as a whi-tle he got out of the
chair and said: "You made a good job of
ii, Miss Doud." He looked at himself in
the glass again, and again remarked:
"Yes, it's a great job, but it's awful cold."
Captain Brokaw fathers the story that
Cashin has ordered a Chinese scalp-piece
and pigtail, in order to matte at least the
appearance of a heathen during the time
his hair is growing.
Miss Dai-y has won her first bet and she
is satisfied.
FAIR'S REAL ESTATE.
Children of the Dead Millionaire
Hanker for a Speedy Distribution
of the Landed Propntty.
Charles L Fair, Theresa A. Oelrichs and
Virginia Fair, children of the late James
G. Fair, have liled a petition in Judge
Slack's court to have all the real estate be
longing to the estate of their father dis
tributed to them forthwith.
Relying on the decision heretofore ren
dered by Judge Slack touching the trust
clause in the will of their lather the peti
tioners allege that the real property of tne
estate was not disposed of by the will, and
that as sole heirs at law they are entitled
to all of said property. Tney say that
the estate is but little indebted, that the
personal property is of treat value and
more than sufficient to meet all demands
of creditors, and that the distribution
asked for may be made without loss to
the creditors of the estate.
The list of property embraced in the
petition comprises 127 parcels of real es
tate, including the property in this City
claimed by Mrs Nettie R. Craven-Fair,
the title to which is still in litigation.
The signatures to the petition are
Knight <fe Heggerty, attorneys for Charles
L. Fair; Lloyd & Wood and Bishop <fc
Wheeler for Theresa A. Oelrichs and
Virginia Fair; Wiisou Â«fe Wilson and Gar
ber, Boalt & Bishop of connsfl for The

I\Tra. Sadie Kobison, a Cripple, Becomes
Tired of L,ife.
Mrs. Sadie Kobison, a married woman,
33 years of age, in a fit of despondency
swaliowed adose of morphine in her room,
393 Sixth street, last night about 9 o'clock.
She was discovered in an unconscious con
dition nbout an hour later and was taken
to the Receiving Hospital.
Dr. Bunnell expressed the opinion that
she could not recover.
The woman was paralyzed on one side
and this made her despondent. She often
said it would be better to be dead than live
a cripple.
Her husband is a business man in France
and has been sending her regular remit
tances. She had been living at 3D3 Sixth
street for about a year. The peonle in the
house know very little about her.

which he had f-ettled !he bill were coun

money.
Schmuckert refused to accept the offer,
contending that he ha I paid for the goods
in true coin and becan suit for tne value

CHEAPER TRAVEL
TO YOSEMITE
New Route to Be Opened
by Way of the Vai
ley Road.
Modesto May Be Made an Im
portant Junction Point on
the Competing Line.
Answer Filed With the Rai'road
Commission to a Fnvo ous
Complaint.
Traffic Manager Moss of the Valley road
is no more allowing the rust to gather on
the rails of his line than is Chief Engineer
Storey permitting the grass to prow along
the surveyed route of the road. Operating
and construction departments vie with
each other in energy and effectiveness,
and almost daily the transportation bu-
dens of the people of ihe San Joaquin
Valley are being made lighter us a result.
The latest plan of the Valley load to
cheapen travel within the State affects the
excursion traffic to the Yosemite. Nego
tiations are now in progress which insure
the opening of a new route to the scenic
wonders in Mariposa County on April 1.
At the present time there is but one
through route from this City to the Yo
semite Valley. T.iis is over the Southern
Pacific line to Kaymonu and thence by
staye into the valley. The route of the
new combination will be to Merced over
the Vailey load and thence to the scenic
Mecca of the Sierras by stage via Coulter
ville.
While the distance will be somewhat
longer than by the old route the traveling
will be more in cresting, more comforta
ble and loss expensive. The stage service
will be unuer the control mid management
of E. M. titoddurd & Son, veteran stage
line owner?. The proposed stage line,
from Merced to Yosemite, is about eiebty
eigiit miles loop, and it will enter the
valley at the lower or western end. Tiie
ascent will not be as great by 1:000 feet as
by way of Ruymond. Pass"ngers will
leave San Francisco at 6p. m. and arrive
at their destination at 4 p. M. on the second
day after, making the entire journey in
Jorty-six hours'.
Anticipating something of this kind,
the Southern Pacific this year reduced the
fare from this City to the valley to $30.
The old rate wus $40. It is estimated by
the projectors that the new route will en
able tourists to save about $22 50 in trans
portation and other expenses.
SURVEYING ROUTES.
Modesto May Be the Point of
Junctlon With the Main Line
of the Valley Road.
Though the Valley road has not yet
disposed of the $â¢â¢>. 000, 000 worth of bonds
that are being printed or any portion of
them, construction work is being pushed
without any abatement of the vigor that
was displayed in the building of the
Stockton-Fresno link. There are ample
funds available for all necessary expendi-
tares, and the directors and trustees
stand ready to advance any sum that
inigtit be required.
The disposition of the bonds will be
quickly decided when they arrive. There
is no question but that most of them wiil
be taken locally, but the directors, with
t!U3 California pride, would like to see
the entire issue kept within the State.
At the meeting of the directors yester
day a contract for 100,000 ties was let to
C. A. Hooper & Co. of this City. They are
for use on the Fresuo-Visalia extension.
Surveyors aie being kept busy on the
territory between Point Richmond and
S:ockton to select the most desirable
route between the points namci. As soon
as t n i â¢â¢ is decided the slow work, such as
tunneline, will be at once commenced and
t.e building of the extensions toward
Bukerslield and toward Point Richmond
will be prosecuted simultaneously.
A serious problem is presented in the
crossini; of the large mnrshy tracts this
side of Stockton, and there is a proba
bility that the Point Richmond extension
may be routed so as to strike the main
line at some point south of Stockton, so
as to avoid crossing these swurupy tracts
Three routes are now being surveyed, and
if it is decided to connect south of Stock
ion, Modesto will in all probability be the
town of junction. In buildine to Modesto
Irom Point Richmond instead of Stock
ton, considerable distance, would also bo
saved between Point Richmond and Mo
desto and points south.
PETTY SPITEWORK.
Answer Made to the Frivolous Com-
plaint of the Union Trans
portation Company.
On behalf of the Valley roaa Attorney
E. F. Preston has filed with the Railroad
commission the answer of that company to
the complaint of James Gillis. The mam
features of ihe matter in dispute are
clearly indicated in the subjoined por
tions of the answer:
This corporation denies that it has secretly
or unlawfully combined or contracted with
the California Navigation and Improvement
Company for the carrying of freignt or pas
sengers, or either of them, over its line of rail
road nt a lower rate than it charges the public
or the said Union Transportation Company for
like servics, or that by virtue of the alleged
illegal co tract, or in any other way, or at all,
that said railroad company is discriminating,
or does discriminate, in us rates or charges
over its said line of railroad in favor of said
California Navigation und Improvement Com
pany and against tho said Union Transporta
tion Company, or ;he general public, or other
wise, or at all.
This company admits the local r.ttes for
fares from Stockton to Fresno to be $3 65, and
admits that the California Navigation and
Improvement Company has established a local
rate for fares of 25 cents irom San Francisco
to Stockton, and admits that the through rate

established by this company and said Califor
nia Navigation and Improvement Company ns
connecting carriers is $3 75; and this company
admits that tho Call torn in Navigation and
Improvement Company, ana this company
have, as connecting carriers, established
through rates lor both passengers and freight
between Fresno and San Francisco and inter
mediate points south from Stockton less than
the sum of the local rate from San Francisco
to Stockton and from Stockton to such point. '
Tnia company alleges that all points and in- ,
termediate points between San Francisco and
Fresno south of .Stockton; are competitive
points. That in order to pive the general pub
lic the benettt of competitive through rates
for both passengers ami freight, less than the
sum of the two local rates between the same
points, this company and tho Califoruia
Navigation and Improvement Company have,
as connecting carriers, entered into traffic
arrangements by which each company agrees
by its own contract; to forward freight and
carry prssengers beyond its own Hue and over
the line of the other company, whicn said
traffic arrangement is a convenience and ben
efit to the public, and that through rates for
freight are given upon through bills of lading,
and that through rates to passengers are
issued upon through tickets by this corpora
tion and the Caliioruia Navigation and Im
provement Company as conuecting carriers,
by virtue of the traffic arrangemantsnforesaid.
That by virtue of the trallic arrangements
aforesaid, ana not otherwise, the efficiency of
tbe service to the public is increased and the
cost of the same is lessened; that the Union
Transportation Company is not a connecting
carrier with this corporation, and that this
corporation does not consider it is for the best
interests of the public or of this corporation
that it should make any traffic arrangements
with the Union Transportation Company men
tioned in the complaint to do business under
joint bills of ladiug tor freight and joint
tickets for passenger service.
That the only complaint of the Union Trans
portation Company is that this corporation
does not deem it advisable to enter into busi
ness relations with such company, which
would enable it to Dind this company by the
joint operation of both lines.
It is well understood that the complaint
of Giili3, manager of the Union Transpor
tation Company, was inspired simply by
business jealousy of the California Navi
gation and Improvement Company, and
that its grounds of complaint are abso
lutely baseless. The Vallry road was de
barred from making a traffic airangement
with the GiJlis company by reason of tbe
fact that the latter was unfavorably situ- j
ated in the matter of the Stockton dock,
and that it did not have the necessary
transportation facilities.
