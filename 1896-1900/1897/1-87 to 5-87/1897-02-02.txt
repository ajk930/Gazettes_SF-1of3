GENERAL CRAIGHILL RETIRES.
Colonel John M. Wilson, a Close Personal
'I Friend .of ' the President, ' Ap- '.-.
â pointed to Succeed Him.
[ WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. I.â General
W. P. Craighill, who was placed on the
retired list to-day at his own request un
der, the 44-year service; bas been entitled !
to retirement since 1889. When he was I
promoted to chief of the Engineer Corps,
nearly two years ago, it was announced
that he would give President Cleveland a
chance to name his successor before the
end of the administratian. ' â¢'
â¢ His record has been most ,' creditable
throughout and as chief of the Engineer
Corps he was responsible for the inaugu
ration of a comprehensive system of coast
defense." He is the only officer who has
been president of the American Society of
i Civil Engineers, having been elected to
! that office in 1804. â¢
Upon receipt of General Craighill's res
ignation the President at once appointed
Colonel John M. Wilson as his successor.
The new chief of Engineers has been a
close personal friend of the President for
several years and during both of the
Cleveland administrations has made all
the presentations of the President at state
functions. â¢Â«â -... - Â-,. â¢
He was born in the District of Colum
bia. October 8, 1835, served as a page in
the Senate, and graduated at the military
academy in 18G0. He served in the ord

_ who calls himself Dr. George 'Â£. Sherwood,
who i** locked Up pending-' examination in
f the Hudson â  County Jail ' iti. Jersey City, i
j they have a mail' swindler whom they' j
I have been pursuing for years' and who'
very likely had.-made a fortune -.by bis .
operations. _\ '.ââ¢' '.' â¢
â¢ Dr. Sherwood; was arrested in Passait
on Saturday as ho was removing his bulky
: mail from bis "private .'.letter-box.'.. His i
t scheme .consisted'- in. . following death !
notices in newspapers in remote . parts of ]
the '-country and at once addressing letters I
f to men who. had just died; .saying he had- ''
I attended a friend of theirs whose - illness- i
j bad terminated fatally , and that this friend J
l had left them a legacy in the form of an \
; insurance on his- life, amounting to a few .
hundred dollars, which he bad asked- him
as his physician to turn over, to the per- '.
son addressed. The letter closed by ask
ing, directions, for forwarding the money.
A letter, generally signed by the widow, .
i would come by return â¢ mail, as, a usual J
'' thing, informing I)r. Sherwood that the |
I person to whom he had written was dead. ',
i Then the next step would be to write -to
j the widow or whoever had replied to
I his first letter, saying that the money j
would go to the widow or next of "kin of I
, the beneficiary.
â¢He explained, however, that the policy
was in a mutual â¢ benefit association and
the premiums were a little behindâper
haps $12 or $15. Dr. Sherwood would in
form the widow that he had enough in- ,
fluence to save the policy if the amount of j
I the premiums were forthcoming at once. I
If the money was sentâ and the postofliee I
j officials say that many complaints re- 1
, ceived showed tnat it was â that was the 1
I end of the transaction.
I When Sherwood was caught he had in j
; his possession, it is said, about a hundrei 1
j letters he had just taken from his mail
box. All of them were from lowa, and !
I more than fifty from the city of Dcs '
j Moines. They have not been opened. ,
Commissioner Roe thinks from his man- !
net and conversation that - Sherwood is a i
young Englishman of good family, who I
has undertaken to live by Lis wits.
He decline** to answer any .questions !
about himself and was committed in de
fault or $1000 bail until Thursday morn- j
ing. by which time the papers in the case ]
will have arrived from Washington.

HANFORD, Cal., Feb. I.â There are two points upon which can be questioned the contention of Sheriff Buckner and his men that the prisoner now con
fined in the Kings Couniy jail is none other than George Taylor, one of the murderers of the Meeks family in Missouri, who escaped from 'â¢ the Missouri penitentiary
when under sentence of death. In height he does not come up to the requirements of the published description of the escape, and while in these descriptions
George Taylor is said to have black eyes, the man confined here, has eyes of a grayish bine. Taylor resisted an order to remove his clothing this afternoon, and an
officer had a lively scuffle to enforce obedience. Except for a scar on one knee, no marks were found upon his body. Of three men who "knew George Taylor at
Browning, Mo., the scene of the Meeks massacre, Lane alone is' positive that the prisoner is in reality the murderer. ' He is the only one of the three who knew the
brothers intimately. Sayers believes that the man is prison here is '.Taylor, but will not say so positively; while Crookshanks, who had seen Taylor but once in
twelve years, says the prisoner is not as tall as Taylor was.- -Sayers. asked the prisoner if he wanted to go back to Missouri with htm and "Rattlesnake Bill" replied :
"I would as soon go with you as with any one, but if you don't treat me better than your brother did you will have a' scrap on your hands right off."
As Sayers' brother helped to capture George Taylor in 18&4 this remark would seem somewhat incriminating. â  i

are deeply concerned in the welfare of

' tion and for. which they will not" be fully
paid until. the vessel has received, her final i
inspection at sea in the next" few months.
Mr. Cramp visited the ship before hurrying \
i to Washington with the proposition; and
j found that about 125 feet, of the outer
plating, on either side of the keel had
been bent, rivets -sheared off and plates I
ripped away in many places. He says all j
' necessary tugs and lighters will be along:
side the vessel to-night getting out the '
coal, ammunition and heavy stores to !
make the ship light enough . to pass, over
the ledges on her return trip up the" river I
'to the navy-yards, where she will be j

' river current at the yards a bar has formed ]
I where the receiving ship Richmond is I

This bar is too shallow to let the Brook
lyn into the dock in her present condition,
but a dredge will be put to work to open a

The iceboats owned by the- city of Phil

sage through the ice, and ho effort will be
spared to get the Brooklyn into the dock
to-morrow. If ' absolutely necessary, her
heavy guns will be taken off. It is esti
mated that the vessel can be made ready

the room-under- the load of, not' a cask of ,'.

That map was himself, "Billy. Lamphrey,

how he came to draw *J35 for Miss Bertola. 7
He received one day' a letter containing -a : â¢

Wright of Alameda denied that he had
j requested Duckworth to appoint J. M.
Olive or any other man. This testimony
caused Emmons to smile with victory,
and tne bystanders to nudge and wink,
but Wright spoiled the sensation' by add
ing that Leavitt of Alameda had told him
that Duckworth had put Olive and Bar- .
) netton the temporary roll on Leavitt's _
I suggestion. "... " â¢â¢
"If I had' known that Duckworth had

candor. . . :'â 'â ' - * -:â¢":-.

the chief clerk contending that he had
done nothing wrong in making the ap

hence, if the law stood as it does now, he
.would exhaust the contingent fund even
if he had to employ a thousand attaches
to do so.
The committee will meet again to-mor
row afternoon and wiil absorb some more
wisdom from Assemblymen who piled on
the temporary roll all " that the traffic
would bear.
"Pending this never-ending investigation
.the pruning knife may be used on the
permanent roll, and the shylocks who
bave discounted warrants ahead may be
left in the lurch, which is a consoling
thought. Speaker Coombs told a Call
reporter this evening that be did not be
lieve any attaches were on the permanent
roll who did not nave a right to be there.
But the feeling wan that there were more
than were necessary to do the business of
-the/House, and if that should be found to
be lie case the superfluous attaches would
"be cut off in the interest of retrenchment.
: 77 This afternoon Speaker Coombs, "field
ing the chair to Dibble, made a motion
on tne floor of the House for the appoint
â¢ ment by "the Speaker of a committee of
three, to investigate the payroll of the
Assembly and to recommend the necessary
.reforms.
â¢7 There is no question in my mind,"
said Coombs, "that the payroll is too
large, but I don't believe a reduction can
â¢be made in it unless it is investigated in a
scientific manner. I would rather have
"the i. committee ot" three also take into con
sideration any appointments in which 1
myself may be specially interested and if
heed? oe have them stricken from the roll.
â If there is any member here charged with
more appointments than he is entitled to,
or his constituency is en titled to, he ought
to .stand in and consent to the sacrifice.
'Ihe only way to get at it is by the ap
pointment of a committee. If there is any
one employed who is not here or not
actually engaged in service, his position
should be forfeited. This committee
should. strike off the list all those attaches
that. are not absolutely needed."
-â â¢â¢The '* resolution was adopted unani
mously, mid Dibble in the chair appointed
Coombs, Valentine and Bridgford.
-.'Speaker Coombs asked to be excused
from serving on the committee, "lam
Speaker row,'' said D.bble, "and I decline
lb excuse '.lie Speaker.'*
â¢: Bfidgiord asked to be let off, but Dibble
rapped him down with the -ravel.
'."i occupy the same position as Judge
Bridgford," began Valentine, but the gavel
cut him short.
"1 decline to excuse anybody at pres
ent," said Dibble. '7..
Valentine was red with indignation. It
has been his bad luck this session to be al
vj^ys. misunderstood. "I was not going
to ask ;o be excused," be said, "but I was
going to say that the Speaker should not
be excused nor anybody eise."

come out from his room. It is expected
that he will do so when all the so-called

.Tax Collector ex-officio the License Col- !
lector. Tne emoluments of the License
'.Collector are to consist of either fees or a I

whether such remuneration could be paid

of- the constitutional provision against I

, on Three Important Kills.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Feb. I.â Three
important bills were to have been passed
upon by the Senate Committee on Com
merce, Harbors, etc. Two of these per
tained to San Francisco and one to San
Diego, but owing to the absence of the
authors of the measures the hearing went
over until later in the week.
The first was Braunhart's bill to rescind
the power of the Harbor Commissioners
to make long leases of water-front prop
erty. Action on this was deferred until
Friday nigbt, though Chairman Gleaves
expressed himself as being opposed to it.
He was the author of the bill giving the
commission power to make such leases,
and by means of which the Valley road
was enabled to secure the lease of China
Basin.
Braunhart's bill to issue State bonds to
the amount of $1,000,000 to extend the sea
wall to Channel street also went over till
Friday night. Then came a bill of great
importance to San Diego, which had been
introduced by Senator Withington.* Its
object is the improvement of San Diego
harbor. It appropriates $50,000 for the
erection of a State wharf, the purchase of
a dredger, and for paying the lecal ex
penses incident to securing possession of
the tide lands on the bay of San Diego
and the other indebtedness of tbe State
Board of Harbor Commissioners for the
bay of San Diego. . â¢ â¢.ââ¢-
Chairman Withington called attention
to the fact that the bill was not drawn in
accordance with constitutional require
ments. It provides or lour different ap
propriations, and four separate bills
should have been presented. He also
stated that the author, who posed as the
"watchdog of bills," to see that they were
constitutional, had singularly omitted the
enacting clause from his bill. In the ab
sence of Withington the bill went over
until Wednesday nisht, when the pilot
age bill is to be again considered.
At a meeting of the Committee on Labor
and Capital to-night it was decided to re
port favorably on .Treacy's Assembly bill,
placing the minimum wages ai $2 per day
on all public work. Similar action was
taken on the bill fixing the tenure of the
Board of Public Works. Action on the
Labor Bureau bill was deferred.

tfilhington's Hill to Establish a A'eu*
Retail Liquor System.
bACRAMENTO. Cal.. Feb. I.â For the
past four days Senator Morehouse has
been .apparently glued to the seat of his
desk. Come in at what time one might
there he was bent down over a pile of
manuscript or documents, or a copy of
the codes. Sunday brought no exemption
from his self-imposed and absorbing task,
and the outlook is* that he will spend at
least another two days.
He is engaged in preparing the bill
which ia to establish in Santa Clara
County in the former Home for Feeble
minded the female department of the
Whittier School, which is at present a
part of the institution in Los Angeles
Count}'.
All the preliminary work of visiting and
inspection has now been completed, and
the task now remaining is that of prepar
ing a bill that shall meet the favor of the
Governor and also the Los Angeles dele
gation in each house. This is what Sena
tor Morehouse is now engaged upon. The
measure will of necessity be a voluminous
one, and must be prepared with great care
and precision, so as to keep it clear ot all
snags. It will probably" contain 10,009
Words.
The first draft Senator Morehouse ex
pects to have completed by Tuesday night.
It will then be submitted to the Governor
and the Los Angeles representatives, so
as to remove all features of possible fric
tion in committee or on the floor. He
calculates that it will be in shape for in
troduction Thursday morning.
Ample compensation is being made by
the Republican Senators for the alleged
sins of the Poi-tilisi and fusionist infected
Assembly. While the conglomerate mi
nority of Democrats, Populist 3 and fu
sionists in the northern wing of the Capi
tol is raising a bowl over a state of affairs
which they more or less' contributed to
create the Senate, barren of hybrids and
freaks and comprising twenty-eight Re
publicans and but twelve Democrats, goes
on with its labors and daily adds to its
enviable record.
It has previously been told in these
columns how it has outstripped nil pre
vious California Senates in the extraordi
nary amount of business it has disposed
of, anil it is now to the front with an
equally remarkable financial showing.
Up to the 2d oi February in the session
of 1895. which answers to February 1 of
this session, the expenses ot the Senate,
aside from the salaries of the Senators
and statutory officers, were $5101.- Fur
the four weeks ending to-day they are but
$30/. â reauction, as compared with two
years ago, of. very nearly 4.0 per centâ and
the same ratio is likely to be maintained
to the end of the session.
One of the most remarkable and inter
esting measures placed before the Senate
for its consideration this s -ssion is No. 156,
introduced by Senator Within aton, pro
viding lor a complete and radical cuange
in the manner of controlling the retail
liquor trade, except that portion of it
which pertains to vinous and malt liquors.
11 is proposed innovation is known as
the "Norwegian system," and is in force in
Norway and Sweden, with, it is said, most
beneficial results. Drunkenness has '"all
en off, it is claimed, in those countries to
but a small fractional part of what it was,
people get a better class of liquor, and
there is less disease traceable to the use of
liquor. One of the objections to the meas
ure is that it creates a monopoly, limited,
it is true, but still a monopoly. The meas
ure-is of such an unusual character that
its text is given in full: .
In any city or town which grants licenses
for the sale of intoxicating liquors a petition
signed by qualified voters of any such city or
town not less In number than one for every
one hundred persons who voted at the next
receding election in such city or town, but
In no case less than fifty, may be presented to
the City Council of such city or to the Trus
tees of such- town, asking them to insert
in the call for the next municipal elec
tion or town meeting an artic.e providing
for a vote upon the question, "If licenses for
the sale of intoxicating, liquors, Other than
light wines arid malt liquors, are granted in
this city (or town) shall they be granted under
the Norwegian system?" II said petition is
duly filed with the bond, as hereinafter pro
vided, tha City Council or Trustees, as the
case may be, shall Insert such article in said
call. The vole shall be taken thereon, and the
result determined In the manner provided by
law for other questions. r -
Said petition, together with tho bond duly
approved as hereinafter provided, shall be
filed with the City or own Clerk, as the case
may be, at least ten days before the time fixed
for the issue of the call for the city election or
town meeting. . â Â»
The question relating to the Norwegian sys
tem shall not be inserted in the call or printed

1 of this act, unless there is ..filed

$1000 in towns and of *50Q0 in cities, exe
cuted by not less than five- citizens ol such
city or town, approved by a Judge of the Su
perior Court and conditioned upon the for

business under such licenses for at least. three
years from said first day oi May, but to be void
If such city or town shall not vote to grant
licenses under the Norwegian system.
In any city or town voting to grant 'licenses
to sell intoxicating liquors under the 'Nor

wherein a corporation .Is organized 'to take

on its capital, except as hereinafter provided,
to the md of objects of general public benefit
and utility, to te decided upon as hereinafter
provided.* There shall be but one such corpo
ration doing business within such city or

them which a commission composed, in
cities, of the Mayor, City Treasurer and the
Auditor, in towns, of the Chairman of the
Board of Trustees, the Town Clerk and Treas

best conduct its business to secure sobriety
and good order conformably to the provisions
of this act. Whenever more than one such

said remainder to be expended for each one of
the objects selected shall be determined by
the shareholders at a meeting called for that
purpose.
The Commissioners of Banks shall investi

Brooklyn Girls Mentally and Physically
" -.7 .', n recked.
NEW YORK. N. V., Feb. I.â Brooklyn
school girls will swear by homeopathy
from now on because the Homeopathic
Medical Society of Kings County will
present a resolution to the Board of Edu
cation on Tuesday demanding the modifi
cation of the course of study in the Girls'
High School. The resolutions will be
backed up by strong verbal arguments.
The persons connected With the society
are convinced that the hard study "required
of the students is having a serious effect
on their health. The large number of
children wearing glasses is credited to the
demands of the High School course.
These persons have been studying the
subject for a Jong time. Their attention
was first enlisted last May by Dr. Alton S.
Warner, who read a taper before the so
ciety on the subject.' One of tha physi
cians interested in the matter said to
day:
"The curriculum of the Girls' High
School is so extensive and the' standard is
so high that many girls have given way
under the strain of trying to pass saiisiac
tor.y examinations. It was noticeable at
the recent graduation that half- the girls
showed evidences of the intense mental
strain to which they had been subjected.
Rosy cheeks were very scarce."

THE DOCUMENTS
Complies With the Senate's
Resolution Concerning
Sanguilly. .
Olney Says. Administrative Ac
tion by Spain May Reason
ably Be Expected.
But a Letter From General
Lee Holds Out Faint Hopes tor
the Prisoner.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 1. â Im
mediately after the reading of Friday's
journal in the Senate to-day that body,
on motion of Sherman (R.) of Ohio, chair
man of the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions, went into executive session, pre
sumably for the presentation of the report
of the Committee on Foreign Relations
upon the arbitration treaty.
The doors were opened at 12:45, and
legislative business was proceeded with.
Various petitions in favor of the ratifica
tion of the arbitration treaty were pre
sented. â¢ â¢
hill (D.) of New York presented a bill
granting a pension of $75 a month to the
widow of General Joseph B." Carr, and ex
plained that a like bill had previously
passed Congress and been sent to the
President, who had not signed , it, but it
was claimed at the Pension Office that it
had failed to become a Jaw because Con
gress was in recess during the ten days
allowed for the signature or veto of bills.
He doubted the propriety of that ruling,
but felt that the simplest and easiest way
was to pass the bill over again.
The bill was passed, as was also another
bill, governed by the same facts, increas
ing the pension of the widow of General
Hough to $70 a month.
. Bills, to provide. for the revision and
codification of the criminal and penal
laws of the United States, to consolidate
the Circuit and District courts of the
United States, and relating to the em
ployment of counsel, by the Attorney-
General or by district attorneys, were in
troduced by Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts
and referred to the Judiciary Committee.
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire intro
duced a resolution instructing the- Com
mittee on Privileges and Elections to
inquire into the recent Presidential and
State election in Delaware an 1 ascertain
whether tbat State is receiving the enjoy
ment of a republican form of government.
Referred.
A bill giving certain powers to the Com
missioners of the D. strict of Columbia as
to the stretching of wires for illuminating
purposes during inauguration week was
fiercely resisted by Hale (R.)of Maine,
who denounced the "obstinacy and wrong
headedness" of the commissioners. 'After
a long discussion the bill was passed with
an amendment, prohibiting specifically
the construction of underground conduits
for the purpose.
A message from the President, with a
report from the Secretary ot State, giving ;
the information called for by a Senate res- |
olution as to the arrest and condemnation
in Cuba of Jules Sanguilly, an American
citizen, was laid before the Senate and re
ferred to the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions. In. his report to the President on
this case Mr. Olney says: "It might be
added that in view of all tbe circumstances
in this case, and especially of the long im
prisonment already suffered by the ac
cused, representations have been made to
the Spanish Government which it is be
lieved will not be without effect, as the
case is one in which administrative ac
tion may be reasonably expected."
Among the correspondence is a letter
from Consul-General Lee, dated December
31, in which he says he visited the
Cabanas fort and had a talk with San
guilly, an American an.l formerly a gen
eral in the insurgent army, who, while a
valiant officer in the previous war, had
taken no part in thi- rebellion.
"He had," writes Mr. Lee, "so far as I
am informed, .committed no overt act in
that direction (the present insurrection)
and was taken without arms in his hands
and while taking a bath in his house in
February, 1895. His second trial toot
place December 21, 1396, and ended in his
again being sent to perpetual imprison
ment. .
"The lawyer who defended this prisoner
in his first trial now looks from a cell ad
joining his in Cabanas fort, and I am in
formed that the lawyer who managed his
appeal before the Madrid court has suf
fered therefor, so that it may be difficult to
procure in Madrid another person versed
in the law who will consent' to manage
lor Sanguilly the appeal proceedings.
"Only a few days afterSanguilly's arrest
a proclamation was issued offering am
nesty to all persons in arms who would
give themselves up. This ought to apply
to persons who hud been arrested without
arms in hands. Roman Perez Truji.Uo
and Jose Maria Timiteo Aguirre were ar
rested, I am told, at the same time as
Sanguilly and' for the same reason â be
cause they said they would engage in war.
Alter a short incarceration they were lib
erated.
â¢ "In view of these facts and the addi
tional reason that Sanguilly has been in a
cell for twenty-three months, is not in
good health and is suffering from old
wounds, i respectfully suggest that the
department bring these facts to the notice
of the Madrid Government and ask that
instructions be wired for nis release from
prison on condition that he leave the
island and not return until the present
war is ended." '
The letter transmitted by .President
Cleveland expresses no opinion ; it simply
responds to the Senate resolution. . â¢
The Nicaraguan canal bill was then
taken up as the unfinished business, and
unanimous consent was asked' by Morgan
(D.) of Alameda to have a- vote on the
measure taken at 4 o'clock.
Vilas (D.) of Wisconsin objected.
Hale (11.) of Maine suggested an exten
sion of time to Thursday next at 4 o'clock,
but to tbis Vilas also objected.
Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts appealed to
Vilas to withdraw his objection and allow
time for a final vole. : â¢
Davis (R.) of Minnesota joined in the
appeal on the special ground of allowing
the bankruptcy bill to be taken up and
acted upon.
Daniel (D.) of .Virginia, one of th? oppo
nents of the Nicaragua bill, called upon
the. friends of the bill to desist from their
activity and let the Senate take up and
consider the bankruptcy bill for the relief
of the people who had been wrecked,
ruined, prostrated and almost destroyed,
by the premature brands ot prosperity
served out to them under recent systems
of legislation.
Remarks, in favor of speedy action on
the Nicaragua canal bill were made by the
two California Senators (White and
Perkins). WHTOwlHllfi^iyiiV
The pending question was on the motion
made by Vilas last Thursday for the re
committal ol the. bill to the' select com-'
mittee on the Nicaraguaâ¢ canal. . *.
Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada argued against
tbe motion.
Caff cry (D.) of Louisiana said that it
was not to be taken for grafted that the
opponents of the Nicaragua bill. were op
posed to the scheme, of connecting the
Pacific and Atlantic oceans by a canal.
He favored the project, but opposed the
instrumentalities by. which the pending!
bill proposed to effect it. . â¢
Vilas advocated. his motion to recommit,
alluding to the inter-oceanic canal project
as "a historic dream.'. He reminded Sen-"
ators that they had been told the other
day by Mr. Sherman, who was to be the c
chief character in the next administra
tion, that the bill could not possibly pass
the House during the present Congress,
and, he (Vilas) trusted fervently that the
Senator trom Ohio was right. He trusted,
therefore, that the appeal was equally ad- .
dressed to those who opposed t< c bill.
The constant repetition of amendments
on tbe part of the Senator from Alabama
himsell showed the necessity of having
tbe bill recommitted. ** "_V\
Vila-> went on to criticize the bill in .
detail, stating that the stock was non
assessable; that the stockholders were
not to be called on to contribute a dollar
to the work, and that the Government oi
the United States was to pay all the Co3t
of' construction and become the * sole
owner and proprietor of the canal, assum
ing all risk, which included possibly" that
of war. He quoted some other provisions
of the bill, the efiect of wnich was that
'â¢the United States should crawl into the
skin of this defunct corporation"â the
Maritime Canal Company. There ."was
one section of the -bill, he sad, which
became immediately operative, even if no
work was ever begun" on tbe "already
discredited route," and that was for the
payment of 14.500,000 and interest to the
company, although the property of the
company at the present moment could
not be estimated at more than $500,000.
He felt bound to protest against sunn rob
bery of the taxpayers of the United States.
Vilas occupied the floor up to 5 o'clock,
when he yielded to a motion to proceed to
executive business. That motion was
agreed to and soon afterward the SeViate
adjourned until to-morrow. . *-'.':'.â¢
The second executive session to-day was
devoted to a consideration of the nomina
tion of George A. Van Atta to be Post-'
master at Clay Center, Kans. The nomina
tion ha 3 not been reported by the commit
tee, but Senator . Peffer,' supported by
Senator Hill, urged action, and Senator
Baker of Kansas antagonized it. - *â¢
Van Atta was nominated to succeed a
man who died alter holding the place

that the Republicans are entitled to the

' -KINGSTON, Jamaica, Jan. 26.â News
has been received here of the successful
landing on Sunday last of a big filibuster
ing expedition on the coast of Santiago
province, Cuba. The expedition disem
barked without molestation from the
Spanish gunboats which were looking for
it, but looked in the wrong place.
The convoy was met, however, by a body
of Spanish troops that were not looking
for it, and had a skirmish. The Cuban
forces succeeded in drawing the troops
into an ambush, where a much stronger
body of Cubans were lying. The result
was disastrous for the Spaniards, who lost
so heavily that they were glad to retreat
and allow the convoy to continue its march
into the interior.
The expedition got into the camp of
Gircia without further trouble. The sup
plies received by this expedition will po
far toward equipping the army of Garcia
for its share in the big stiugglo between
Wevlcr and Gomez that is coming off
soon. â¢'". .:''-': â .''..'

NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. I.â A Sun spe
cial from Key 'West' says: Dr. William

spondents 'of two "Hamburg newspa
pers, arrived here .on. Saturday from
Cuba, where they have been about two
months traveling all over the island. They

they have been in Cuba in many places to
which the war has given an added in
terest. â Â-'. .*.'.*;."; â .*â¢*''
In their opinion the situation is such
that Spain will be able to carry, on the
war only as long as she can obtain money
to pay the troops; that after her monetary
resources are exhausted, which is likely
to occur very soon, the Spaniards will have
tv abandon the island.
lie hatred against Spain is so intense
thai not only the men,' but the Cuban
women and children are insurgents. The
concentration of the country families in
towns, ordered by Weyler, is carried out
with great cruelty. The two correspond
ents have seen many of these poor people
dying from starvation in some interior
towns after having suffered on their way
from the country all kinds of ill-treatment
from the Spanish soldiery.
.The depredations committed by the
Spanish troops cannot be described.
Words cannot give an exact idea of the
criminal extremes to which the Spaniard.",
go and only eye-witnesses can believe that
human nature is capable of such mon
strosities.
The Cubans, knowing this, never sur
render in battle, and when any of .hem
falls wounded he will fight in despair on
the ground until the last moment rather
than risk the tortures his foes would be
sure to inflict upon him.
JO PROSECUTE FOR PIRACY.
Harmon 'Orders Proceedings Against
:<,.*â¢- the Three Friends.
WASHINGTON,: D. C, Feb. I.âAttor
ney-General Harmon to-day instructed
the United States District Attorney at J
Jacksonville to proceed â '. against the
steemer Three Friends as a pirate. The
prosecution will be against the vessel and
not against her officers and crew, in ac- r
cordance with section 4297 of the Revised
Statutes. 'â¢ .;.' ..." :â¢*. â 
The purpose of the Attorney-General in
bringing the prosecution is largely to test j
the opinion recently given by Judge !
Lccke of the United Staves court at Jack- j
sonville against the Three Friends.
In discharging: her .officers from cus
tody Judge Locke held that there was no
slate of war in Cuba and the Three
Friends was not therefore engaged in a
political mission.'^
According to the understanding at. the
Department of Justice this opinion clear
ly made, the Three- Friends amenable to
prosecution for piracy, granting the state
ments appearing in the newspapers are
true, that she was armed and fired upon a i
Spanish vessel, for if her mission was non- j
political she. was engaged in an armed
attack on or resistance to a friendly state.
The prosecution has an additional in
terest in the fact* that the case will be
heard before Judge Locke. No one here, !
however, believes that the yarns about i
this unarmored tugboat, carrying a soli- |
tary Hotchkiss gun, attacking a well
rquiped Spanish gunboat, can be sus
tained by the slightest fragment of proof.
TREATED II ITH LOXTEMPT.
Colonel Barker Insulted by the Spanish
. ----- , Authorities.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Feb. 2.â A Herald
special from Key West says: Colonel
Walter B. Barker. United States repre
â¢ sentative In Sa_.ua la Grande, Cuba, is in
dignant over an insult offered to him by
FOUR STATES CREATED BY THE CUBAN REPUBLIC
With an apparent desire to do away with everything pertaining to Spanish rule the revolutionary Government of Cuba divided the territory occupied by the
main island from Cape Maisi to Cape San Antonio and the adjacent smaller islands and keys, formerly comprised within the six royal provinces, into four new States,
with new names and for the most part entirely different boundaries. This work was one of the first acts of the Constituent Assembly, which met at Jiraaguaya,
September 13,1695. In all references to affairs of the Government the movements of the armies and troops, in all the reports and dispatches from Cuban sources,
tbese divisions and names are used, sometimes to the bewilderment o.f the reader, who can find no such divisions and names on the map, or if he can form- any idea
as to the part of the island iti which they lie he is still at a loss to define their limits. ...
The lour new States are called Oriente, Camaguey, Las Villas or Cabanacan and Orcidente. The State of Oriente, as its name would indicate, lies in the
eastern end of the island and comprises all the territory from Cape Maisi, its extreme point on the east, to Porto Manati. on the northern coast, and on the west to
the Rio Jobabo, rising near and flowing south into the Gulf of Guacanayabo. Its limits are the same as those of the Spanish Province of Santiago de Cuba. The
State of Camaguey lies next on the west, its eastern boundary being the same as the western of Oriente. Its western boundary begins at the Laguna de Blanca on the
coast, just north of the town of Moron, and runs south to that place, and thence with the line of.the old military trocha to Jucaro on the south coast, leaving both
these towns, with Cirgo de Avila, in this State. Camaguey comprises the greater part of the province of Puerto Principe, though the western boundary of the latter ;
was a line running nearly north and south along the Jatibonico del Sur and Jatibonico del Norte, some twenty miles west of the trocha. Five miles east of the
trocha is the diocesan line, which divides the island into .two bishoprics, one with its see at Santiago de Cuba and the other at Havana. This line is also the
boundary of the two grand departments into which the island is divided for administrative purposes, the eastern with headquarters at Santiago de Cuba and the .
western at Havana. This line runs across a low plain, nowhere fifty feet above the sea, and on which there are few, if any, inhabitants, whicn makes it a very
suitable boundary. " * . â -.''â â 
The State of Las Villas adjoins Camaguey on the west. It includes that part of Puerto Principe lying between the trocha and the Rio Jatibonico and all of
the province of Santa Clara except the portion west of Colhinas Bay and south of the Rio Gonzalo. The western boundary is about the same as that of Santa Clara
from the mouth of the Hannobana River until it reaches the Rio Pal ma, which it follows to the sea. This State about covers that portion of the island known as Las
Cinco Villas, so called from the five cities which it included â Sagua la Grande, San Juan de Remedios, Villa Clara, Trinidad and Cienfuegos. No definite limits were
set to the district, but it was understood to cover the territory tributary to the live cities above named. - ...Â»
The State of Occidente begins at the western boundary of Las Villas and extends west to Cape San Antonio, including a part of the province of Santa Clara.
Nearly all of Matanzas, Habana and Pinar del Rio, with the Isle of Pines and the others to the south of its coasts. The other islands and keys alone the coast belong
to the nearest State, as the Jardlnes del Rey on the north and the Jardines de la Keina on the south to Camaguey. The headquarters or seat of government of the
revolution is on the top of the Sierra de Cubitas, in the State of Camaguey.

TBIRTY UXSUCCES*PUL STRIKES.
Remarkable Record of a Tear's Labor
'.' Troubles in Germany.
LONDON, Esq.. Feb. I.â The Standard's
Berlin correspondent telegraphs that the
strike of dock labo and others em
ployed in the shipping trade at Hamburg
has ended in the complete defeat of the
strikers, owing to the lack of funds.
Many of the men are now trying to ob
tain work, only to find that their places
have been filled. This result of the great
strite was predicted in the dispatches of
the United Associated Presses some weeks
ago. ' â¢
lt is remarkable that of all the thirty
strikes that look place in Germany in
1896 not one has been successful, although
they cost many millions of marks. In
February there was a great strike In the
ready-made clothes trade, and in March
among. the textile workmen at Cottbus
and Mu. lious. Then followed the tilers',
shoemakers', cigar-makers' and capmak
ers' strike in Berlin.
Next the cutlers in the district of Solin
gen went out and were, followed by the
hands of the factories at Biel, the litho
graphers at Berlin and so on. Altogether
about a hundred thousand men were out
during the year, but they all were com
pelled to go back again without attaining
their object. .

Rumored attack on the German Minister
Blscredited at Berlin*
BERLIN, Germany, Feb. I.â Dispatches
have been received here from Bangkok
stating that Herr Kempermahn, the Ger
man Minister to Siam, had been attacked
in the streets by a Siamese mob, who de
fied the efforts of the police to quell their
rioting.
An American engineer named Bennett, |
the dispatches say, placed himself at the ;
head of the police and led them against j
the mob, dispersing them, and rescued the
Minister. The Berlin semi-official papers !
are rather skeptical as to the truth of the j
dispatch, and assert that the German Mm- j

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1597.
COMPTROLLER ECKELS TALKS.
Gives His Views on the Financial Problem
Before the Committee on Banking
and Currency.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. The
exchange of views between Comptroller
Eckels and the Banking and Currency
Committee was continued to-day. Mr.
Eckels expressed the opinion that' the
only way to solve the financial problem
would be to secure a proper banking bill.
In reply to a question regarding bank
issues' he said. .that if holders of notes
knew that banks were able to pay in gold
they would prefer paper to coin. Busi
ness people also preferred paper to metal
lic money. Proportionate to the amount
of business done the amount of gold was
practically nothing. As the system of
clearing-houses was developed the ex
change of gold in the settlement. of diffi
culties was still further reduced. He said
that Great Britain had nearer reached
perfection regarding credit facilities than
any other country. America came next,
wtth Germany and France third and
lourth. . .
Mr. Newlands of the committee assumed
that we would require $950, 000, 000- in gold
to establish the system proposed, and
asked Mr. Eckels where he would get the
requisite amount.
Mr.' Eckels replied that we would get it
from England, France. Germany, or some
otner country that had cold to sell. We
could always lind countries which had
gold ready to exchange for products they
needed. The percentage of gold held by
Great Britain against its credits was the
smallest in the world. The surrender of
gold by a country as a rule was purely
voluntary. The trouble here was that the
gold was taken from the treasury instead
of in the usual way in the course of trade.
A declaration by the Comptroller that
he believed the single gold standard essen
tial to the prosperity of a great nation
nearly precipitated a silver discussion, but
the settlement of a question of order as to
who was entitled to the floor occupied ihe
remainder of the session, and at 3:10 the
committee adjourned to meet again to
morrow morning, when the Comptroller
will be asked to discuss the several bills
before the committee proposing . general
changes in the banking system.

DUNDEE, Scotland, Feb. .I.â bye
election to fill the vacancy in the House
of Commons caused by tne resignation of
James Martin White (Liberal) was held in

Ramsey, Unionist a Liberal majority of

At the general election Mr. White was
given a majority of 432. He was then op
posed by Mr. Ramsey* the present de
feated candidate. As compared with the
.votes cast at the general election, to-day's
.polling showed an increase on the part of
both Liberals and Conservatives. The
canvass was a particularly warm one and
the Liberals are congratulating them
selves on being able to retain the seat by
an increased majority.
Captain Sinclair was in Canada when he
was unanimously nominated by the For
farshire Liberal Association,, but he re
turned to Scotland shortly afterward and
made a warm tight for election. He was
actively supported by John Morley, for
merly Chief Secretary for Ireland.
Captain Sinclair is no novice in political
life, he having represented Dumbarton

aide-de-camp to the Earl of Aberdeen
I when, the latter was- Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland. Ho retired, from the army in

ical, favoring home-rule, electoral reform,
reform of the parochial board system of
Scotland and of the land laws" and an
eirht-honr bill for miners, etc.
The resignation of Mr. White, which
caused the bye-election, was caused by his
being made the defendant in an action for
breach of promise, brought against him
by Miss Ellen Grant, the daughter of a
Dundee clergyman, which action is now
pending.

Defense of Forger Sanders
Begins in Fresno's
Court. ;
Witnesses Claim They Saw the
Alleged Victim Alter His S
Disappearance.
Evidence Introduced to . Prove the
Previous Good Character of 7
the Accused. â¢
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. I.â Attorney
Frank H. Short made .the opening
statement for the defense tlm morning
in the trial of W. A. Sanders, who is
alleged to have forged the name of Wil
liam Wootton to a $1400 draft. The
prosecution had announced the close of
its case after placing a few witnesses on
the stand. *
Mr. Snort's statement was brief. He â¢
said that he expected, to prove that
Wootton had been seen after his disap
pearance from his ranch on February 1,
1894. Two witnesses had met him in San
Francisco. The attorney also expected to
show that the grounds were insufficient to
assume that the signatures to the draft
and the deeds were forgeries.
The defense then placed several wit
nesses on the stand. They had known.
Professor Sanders for many .years and
attested to his good reputation before he
; became involved in the Wootton mystery.
! The testimony of A. L. Stetson. at the last
i trial was read to tne jury. : ; y'7
Mr. Stetson committed suicide in San
Francisco a lew months ago. He was
under the impression when he testified
that he had seen Wootton in San Fran
cisco in February after his alleged disap
pearance.
Charles H. Chambers was called to the
stand and said he believed he had seen
Wootton in San Francisco, after February
1. N. W. Moodey, at present County Tax
Collector and formerly Postmaster in
this city, testified as an expert on hand
writing. > -"7
He did not believe that the signatures to
the draft and the deeds were forgeries. He
was not very positive, however, and had
not given the papers close study.
The testimony of Frank House, Post
master at Fernando, a small place twenty
miles this side of Los Angeles, which ne
gave at the last trial, was read to the jury.
A few days after the Ist of February, 1894,
he had been handed a letter to mail by a
trainman passing through the place.
This was the " missive received by
Rohloff, the employe at Wootton's ranch,
purporting to have been signed by Woot
ton. The prosecution claims that Sanders
went southward to mail the letter in order
to allay tbe anxiety of Rohloff regarding
the whereabouts of his employer. / _.'

RAILWAY TO BOLINAS.
Mill Valley and Mount Tama/pais Com
pany May Soon Extend Its
Line.
/MILL' VALLEY, Cal., Feb. 1. â A
move of the greatest importance to the
people of Marin County, and especially
interesting to. railroad men and civil en
gineers, may shortly be made by the Mill
Valley and Mount Tarnalpais Scenic Rail
road Company in the extending of its road
to Bolinas, on the Marin coast. The
country that must be traversed by the
new line is mountainous and the con
struction of the road will require en
gineering skill of no mean quality. 'While
the distance from the summit of Mount
Tarnalpais to the town of Bolinas, on the
Pacific Ocean, in an air line is only three
miles the route of the road will be about
seven miles in length, on account of the
numerous loops that must be constructed
in order to obtain easy and gradual grades
lor the mountain engines.
Engineers bave already looked over the
route and assert that the most feasible
plan is to run the line commencing from
the extreme southwestern point now
reached by the Tatna'pais Scenic road and
running in a northerly direction, crossing
to the northwestern slope of the mountain
and descending Tarnalpais by a 7 per cent
grade, which the engineers claim it is pos
sible to obain', to Willow Beach, on the
Pacific Ocean, and irom there skirt the
beach and proceed to Bolinas.
.This route will open tbe vast estates
which lie between Mill Valley and Bolinas
and which are now almost idle and with
out means of communication or transpor
tation except by stage lo San Rafael. Be
yond this primitive method and a tedious
trip by schooner Bolinas. has no way of
j transporting its products to the â¢ metropo
; lis, and. in consequence the progress ex
: hibited by the towns in California is sadly
.lacking in.the little city on the Marin
â  coast. " ' â  .-' " *'â¢'.."-'.
?. .There seems to be a reticence on the
[part of the directors of the Mill Valley
and. Mount Tamaipais Scenic road about
divulging the plans for the future. Vice-
President David McKay was seen this af
ternoon and said he was not at liberty to
state what action the directors had taken
at a meeting held last week- in rezard to
extending the line to Bolinas. It is
known, that Mr. McKay is heartily in favor
of the proposition. He said that the roll
ing stock of the road was to be increased.

N EARING A CRISIS AT SALEM.
Senator Mitchell to Make a Final Attempt
to Bring About His Re-
Election.
SALEM, Or., Feb. The legislative
deadlock is expected to reach a crisis to
morrow. Senator Mitchell has decided to
call a joint session of bis thirty supporters
in the Benson House and sixteen Senators,
declare a legal quorum and ballot lor
i United States Senator. Failing to secure
i a certificate ot election from the Secretary
j of State he will go to Washington and lay
his case before the Senate. The Bourne-
Davis adherents assert that Mitchell
cannot rally more than eleven or twelve
members or the Upper Home to his sup
port and will be unabie to muster a
] quorum. As the Senate has persistently
| refused to recognize either the Benson or
j Davis house it is difficult to understand
how members of that body can 1-gally sit
| in joint session with a discredited assem
j bly. Should Mitchell's followers not suc
j ceed in gathering a quorum the Senator
will in all probability .give un the fight
i and withdraw from the field. A caucus of
â  both factions has beep held every day for
; nearly a week and there are no signs of a
. break on either side.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Feb. I.â Seven bal
lots were taken to-day ih the Utah Legis

I eight votes* on Saturday last, lost two on

! tamed twenty-seven until the AsÂ«emblv
dissolved for the day. Rawlins had 19,
Henderson 14, and . three Republicans
voted for. T. B. Critchlow. The Thatcher
.forces are stable, and the impression pre
vails that . their candidate will in the

votes, the number necessary to a choice:
"otherwise the choice of the Legislature
will probably fall upon a dark horse. -

Choice.'
Ready to Repeal the Bill if He
Decides Upon Another
Location.
Father G irtland of the Catholic Church
Voices His Approval of Glove
Contests.
CARSON, Nev., Feb. Lâ lt was re
ported tnis morning that the sporting fra
ternity of Utah and Montana had offered
to Dan Stuart inducements to pull the big
tight off near Salt Lake, just inside the Ne
vada line. This report' caused great ex
citement here, and members of the Legis
lature declared that if such an offer was'
accepted and the fight taken from Carson
they would repeal the prize-fight bill "so
quickly that it would make Stuart's bead
swim." They voted for the measure on
the understanding that the capital of Ne
vada would be the battle-ground. Already
a canvass has been made of nearly every
member of the Legislature. In.the House
there are nine men who voted against the
bill and one who declined to vote.. These
ten will vote for a repeal of the act, and it
will require but six more votes to repeal it
in the House. Eight have said already
that if the fight does not come off in Car
son they will vote for repeal. ' A change of
two votes in the Senate will repeal it, and
they will be forthcoming at any time that
Dan Stuart announces that the fight will
not come off here.
The feeling is so pronounced on this
subject that there is no longer any ques
tion about the location of the fight, as far
as Carson is concerned, and the Virginia
and Truckee Railroad ' Company is al
ready putting -on extra men to get the
cars in order tc> transport the crowd.
Order** for hotel accommodations and
seats at the ringside are pouring into Car
son. Yesterday a cable dispatch to A.
Livingston, Stuart's agent, came . from
London, asking for twenty seats. Up to
date S6venty-eight Pullman cars have
been engaged in New York, St. Louis,
Chicago and San Francisco and other
cities to transport gilt-edged sports to the
battle ground.
Corbett will train at Steamboat Hot
Springs, near Reno, and Fitzsimraons will
train at Shaw's Hot Springs at Carson. .
Father Gartland of the Catholic church
in- this- city was interviewed to-day con
cerning the prize-fight bill and said: "The
members of the State .Legislature were
sent" to represent the majority of the in
habitants of our commonwealth, and if
the bill permitting priza-fights suited the
majority of our law-makers then tbe mi
nority has nothing to do but submit, and
since the Governor, who has the interests
ot the. whole State at heart, thinks the
bill proper and signed it it is law, and as
such we should all uphold it and do all in
our' power to see that we get as much
benefit out of it as possible.
"There is nothing brutal in glove con
tests as they are carried on at the present
time, as compared with football and a
great many other games that are per
mitted, and if the fight will bring the
moneyed class of people here and benefit
the town financially as well as otherwise,
without doing any barmâ which it will
not then let it take place in Carson by
all means." -
The pastors of the Presbyterian and
Methodist Churches oppose the project,
but they have not been able in any way
to stop the tide of popular enthusiasm for
the bill. .
As yet no place has been selected for the
big pavilion. A dozen have been under
consideration, but all of . tho so-called
picture? of tho spot, published in a San
Francisco daily, have been fakes. The
exact location will not be known until
Stuart reaches this city the latter part of
the week.
A Sac Francisco syndicate is now ar
ranging to build a large hall in Carson
for the big fights that will come off for
some years to come, and next fall, in addi
tion to a fistic programme, there will be.
a pigeon-shooting match for the cham
pionship of the world and a week's horse
racing.

cant resides. The inspector will be named

Nearly $20,000 is dispensed to indigents |
every year, and by the system adopted to- j
day it is believed a great 1 many unworthy |
â¢people will be unable to obtain help and a j
large saving be made to the county. -"7-

CERTAIN PROFITS
IN SUGAR BEETS
Opportunity Presented to
Owners of Land in
California.
Figures Submitted by- Secretary
Smith of the State Board
-'-â¢'..- of Agriculture.
This Sate Could Supply the Entire
Country and Recp a Golden
Harvest.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. I.â The an
nual meeting of the State Board of Aeri
culture was held to-day, with Directors
Boggs, De Long, Terry, Cox, Mackey,
Land and Chase present.
i The annual report prepared by Secre
tary Edwin F. Smith, under the direction
of the board, was submitted and adopted.
It comprises about 10,000 words and is in
teresting as well as instructive in show
ing the possibilities in the extension- of
California's productive interests.
The principal subjects treated were
wheat-growing, meat products, dairying,
horse-breeding, the sheep industry and
the growing of sugar-beets. Much
space is. given to. the latter sub
ject, showing that California had suffi
cient land that' would produce twelve tons
of beets to the acre, of 15 per cent sugar
and 80 per cent fineness, to supply the en
ure United States, and calling the atten
tion" of tne farming community to the
$125,000,000* sent out of this country every
year for' this necessary food. product â a
sura they -should receive for the produc
tion ot sugar. . ." . "
The wheat crop for IS!*; is placed at
29,655.174 bushels, exceeding that of 1895
by 9,000.000 b'u?he!es.' The price ' at the
close of 1890 wassl per cental at tide
water, as against 88 cents in 1594 and
$1 02J4 in 1895.
The causes for the raise were the de
creased yield in Russia, Australia and
India, which countries must now look to
the United States for this important
article of food. It was shown that Cali
fornia, by reason of its location, was
the first to receive the benefits of
the advanced prices and the crop of 1896,
together . with the stock on hand, was
speedily exhausted. Regret. was expressed
that a large portion of the wheat had lelt
the farmers' hands before the advance in
prices. - 'Â*.'
It is believed by the board that the
raising of wheat from this time on offers
special inducements to the soil-workers.
The prices of the past few years have not
encouraged extension and lands have
been put to other uses, wliile inventions
have greatly reduced the cost of harvest
ing. - *
T.iis condition- will for the next few
years be most i beneficial, as lands that
have been used for other cereals will now,
when returned to wheat production, yield
some of the old-time crops that will bring
handsome returns under prospective
prices. * * â¢ .
REDWOOD CITY'S AGED BURGLAR.
Asa Boyce, Sixty-Four' Years of Age and
a Physical Wreck, Sentenced to
-. the Peni.entiary. â 
REDWOOD CITY. Cal., Feb. I.â Asa
O. Boyce, who was convicted here last
Wednesday of burglary, was to-day sen
tenced by Judge Buck to fifteen years in
San Quentiri. This virtually means to the
prisoner a life sentence, for he is now 64
years old and a physical wreck. In pass
ing sentence, the Judge said, that he saw
no extenuating circumstances by reason
of which he should exercise clemency,
and, the jury recommending none, he
must impose the full penalty. He told
the prisoner that he was a bad man and
unsafe to be at large, the evidence at the
trial showing that but for the intervention
of one* of Boyce's accomplices murder
would undoubtedly have been committed.
Boyce was to have received his sentence
on Friday last, but on that day he was so
crippled by rheumatism that he was un
able to travel irom the jail to the court
house. HE-SB
One of his accomplices, Tann, was also
I before the court this morning for sentence,
! he having pleaded guilty to the same
j charge, and appeared as a witness against
I Boyce. Though but 20 years of age, he is
â  apparently as bad a man as Boyce him
self, and the only reason that he was not
eiven the same sentence was because of
his youth and letters from influential peo-
Die interceding on his behalf. He was
sentenced to five years in San Quentin.
The third, Green, appeared for sentence,
he also having pleaded guilty, and having
mnde a full statement and confession to
the District Attorney the day after his ar
rest. The Judge deferred the passing of
sentence on him for one week, saying that
if he had any discretion in the matter he
would order him confined in the County
Jail. He further said that he thought he
would have to send him to the State
prison, but would consider tbe matter.
He however promised that he would make
the punishment as light as the law would
allow. Green does not have the appear
ance or actions of a hardened criminal.
The District Attorney made a statement
in his behalf.
These are the men who looted the dwell
ing of old Fr_ank Schmute in the Alpine
District. Then they gagged Schmute and
tied him to a tree in his yard, where he
could see the flames destroy his house,

SAN GABRIEL CANYON GOLD.
Prospectors Find a Quartz Lead Which
Promises to Yield Fortunes to
Each of Them.
\ SANTA MONICA. Cal., Feb. I.âReli
able news is received of a very rich gold
strike at San Gabriel Canyon, forty miles
east of here. Two miners had been
placer mining there with varied success
since last fall. Recently tbey found
pieces of quartz rich in gold. They put
the quartz to the mortar pestle process j
and panned it out. Their expectations
were fully verified, and they estimated
that it was worth anywhere from $400 to
. $600 to the ton.
*- Next they followed the float until it
gave out, and sunt a shaft twelve feet
deep and then began drifting into the
mountain, which is very steep. It was
not long before they were rewarded by
.finding the ore body, which is said to be
eight inches in thickness and is com
posed of pyrites of iron and gold,- much
of the latter being visible to the naked
eye.
The place at which they are at work is
wholly inaccessible to any mode of trans
portation other than burros, and except
at a very low stage of the water even a
burro could not reach it. For many years
San Gabriel Canyon has been prospected
and worked, and some fair stakes have
been made. The mountains were known
to contain quartz leads many years airo.
They were hrst worked by the Spaniards
and early settlers with better returns than
of late years 7 >'

SAN DIEGO, Cal., Feb. James F
Green, a private in Company H, First
Infantry, United States army, deserted
from the barracks 'a. this city yesterday
and took a steerage passage in the steamer

Green came from the East a few months
ago ana not long since entered Uncle
Sam's service. He had many friends
about the city, some of whom did not
know until last, night that he was a sol
dier. He never came uptown in uniform,
but always in a line suit of clothes,' a coat
of the glove- fitting variety and trousers
freshly creased. He had a fine way about
him and borrowed' money from friends,
and his debts remain unliquidated.
Ever since he joined the army he has
posed as- a married man and was per
mitted to sleep away from the barracks.
He had rooms at 836 Columbia street. It
is said. Green deserted an alleged wife as
well as the army.
COLONEL NUN AN RESIGNS.
Commander of the Sixth Regiment Retires
From the National Guard of
California. -
. STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. Lâ Colonel J. J.
Nunan, who has long been at the head of
the Sixth Regiment, National Guard of
California, has resigned, and his resigna
tion has caused much speculation as to
who his successor will be. Colonel Nunan
will be much missed by the gunrdsmen of
the Sixth, as be has always been an able,
popular and .painstaking officer. It is
generally believed among the guardsmen
that Lieutenant-Colonel Wricht of Fresno:
will be chosen as Hunan's successor. -In
that event, there may be a contest for:
Wright's place, though Major Chisholm
will probably be selected. There are a
number of others who would be ,glad to
take Wright's place, among them Captain
I Graham of Merced, Captain Scrioner of
i Fresno, Captain M. J. Byrnes of Visalia,
j Captain Whitmore- of Modesto and Cap
tain Johnson of this City. V.
_ The retiring colonel of the Sixth Regi
ment has served in the National Guard
for twenty-three years, having enlisted
on December 15, 1873, when he entered
the old Stockton Guard as a private. In
January, 1876, he was commissioned sec
ond lieutenant and three _ months later
was made first lieutenant. When Com
pany B went into the National Guard
Nunan was made captain. In 1888 he was
elected lieutenant-colonel and colonel of
the Sixth in 1892.

WASHINGTON, D. C... Feb. I.â The

in an oi inion by . Commissioner
Prouty, announced a decision in
the matter of unlawful rates and
practices in the transportation of
grain and grain products by the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company,
the Chicago and Great \Vestern railway
and others, concerning a transportation
practice of the Chicago and Great Western
Railway Company.
This company, owning the entire stock
of the lowa Development Company, which
had been organized for the purpose of hold
ing title to certain lands of the railway
companj'. cased grain to be purchased in
Kansas City in the name of the develop
ment company, transported over the lines
of the railway company to Chicago and
there sold upon the market.
The development company has no bona
fide interest in trie transaction. Neither
the railway company â¢ nor the de
velopment company purchased the
grain lor the purpose of owner
ship,, the whole transaction being
simply a device to secure its transporta
tion at other than published rates, and

tuted a violation of the second, third and
sixtn sections of the act to regulate com
merce, and an order directing the railway
company to cease and desist from this

HEAVY TRAGEDY
AT THE BALDWIN
Modjeska . Not Strong
Enough for an Ideal
Lady Macbeth.
A Vaudeville Farce -Comedy
Holds the Boards at the
Columbia.
Continued Success of "A'a-din" at tho
Tivcliâ "A Serious Tangle" at
the Alc.zzr.
:
Lady Macbeth, which Modjeska played
at tho Baldwin last night, is a compara
tively recent ad .1 ition to her repertory,
though she has appeared here in the part
before. There was a good deal of curios
ity among her admirers, however, to see
her. in the heavy Shakespearean role, and
the audience was consequently a large
one.
lt was almost a foregone conclusion,
even among those who had not seen her
as Lad}* Macbeth before, that the finished,
refined Modjeska could not appear to such
advantage as in parts like Marie Stuart or
Rosalind. ".*".':
S.;e had some splendidly felicitous' mo
ments, in which she gave proof if further
proof were required, that she is a great
artist at all times, and her conception of
Lady Macbeth was a fascinating study,
but Modjeska is not tragic enough, nor is
she vocally and physically .robust enough
to rise to. the heights of tragedy required
for a strong interpretation of the part.
The great ' Lady Macbeth of tragedy
have played the woman as the better man
of the two, and Macbeth himself has been
the weaker vessel. Mod jeska's Lady Mac
beth gave glimpses of a womanly heart
and a clinging, tender nature, which were
not in accordance with the virility of her
role.
In the scene where she urges Macbeth
to slay the King Modjeska was clever and
commanding, but she was not the
product of the . rude age which produced
the Thane of Glathis' terrible wife, and
in the banquet scene she was a loving,
sustaining helpmate to the tortured Mac
beth, but she did not strike the keynote of
the tragedy which Haworth reached. ."': *
The sleep-walking scene was a remarka- '
ble and artistic study, but the distraught
woman made one think- more of gentle
Ophelia than of Lady "Macbeth, with her
sinful, tortured conscience. The finish
and the art of the actress, however,
brought her frequent and hearty applause, â¢
and even if Modjeska be not a great Lady
Macbeth, her conception of the role is well
worth seeing as an interesting Shakes
pearean study.
Haworth's Macbeth was a very excel
lent piece of acting. The high pitch of
tragedy which lie struck in the dagger
scene was evenly and splendidly sustained
throughout the rest of the play. He never:
tore the passion to tatters, but on the
other hand he never descended to the
commonplace. In the trying banquet
scene ; is horror and despair were very
realistically depicted, and his final duel
brought his work to an excellent climax.
As Macduff, Lonerean added to hi-, suc
cesses this season. . Like Haworth, he rose
to the heights of tragedy vithout o'er
stepping the modesty of nature. Stevens,
who played the role of Malcolm, did good
work in bis great' scene with Macduff.
Maxwell made a kingly Duncan, and the
witches and their ca.dron were satisfac
tory features of the performances.

pears when- sampled * from tne audi
torium. The plot hinges âround the
exploits of an elderly gentleman, one Stanley
Dodge, who sets off to capture the Dark Conti
nent, but getting as far as New York, falls a
victim to tbe fascinations of a serio-comic
actress. Instead of going to Africa, Dodge, as
the programme expresses it, '-tags after' her
for six months, but receives no encourage
ment." Then he goes home and lies to. liis
family about his adventures lv Africa.
This piot promises amusing developments,
but unfortunately they are not fulfilled in.the
play, which is not a farce-comedy at ail, but a
vaudeville ot the most pronounced type.
Dodge is a serio-comic with several daugh
ters, allot whom are song-ana-dance artists,
who go through life in the abbreviated irocks
and big hats, which are sacred to the vaude
ville stage. Dodpe himself does not disdain
to do a dance "turn" in a baggy style of cos- '
tume, which may be in vogue among African
explorers, out which is more like pajamas.

At the Ale Â«zar.
The stock company presented for their
twenty-third week William Gillette's comedy
drama, "A Legal Wreck." The niece has a
i strong melodramatic flavor about it, and being
well played, takes with the audience.
Miss Bertha Foltz assumed Miss Buckley's
part on less than a half day's notice, and
played it extremely well, too, for the part is a
long and difficult one, and the management is
to be congratulated on securing the services
of so clever an actress. ,
Mrs. F. M. Bates as Nancy Ann Dunks did a
very good piece ot" character work. Miss
Kiltie Behnom and M ss Gertrude Tidbali
completed the feminine part of the cast.
J. B. Polk made the hit of the performance
as Captain Edward Smith, the hearty old sea
captain. Hugo Toland, Francis Powers, Gor
don Foster and Mr. Armstrong did good work.
The piece was beautifully staged, the chief
scene being particularly od.
. . At. the TivoU.
"Aladdin" was the bill presented, and hav
ing received the nece c pruning is now in
smooth running order. Miss Seabrooke plays
the dashing young hero and sings the role
with her usual "success. Anna" Schnabel makes
a lovely princess, singing herself into high
favor.
Ferris Hartman's make-up as Tippoping is
decidedly original. Tho rest of the cast are
doing inelr usual good work.
The bullet music by William Lorraine (the
composer of '-Mollie .Newell") is quite a
feature, and judging from the crowded house
last nignt this piece will run fully as long as
did its predecessor. .
Morosco's Grand Opera-House.
The first production on this coast of "The
Westerner" was seen at Morosco's last night.
The new star at the Grand, Miss Lores a At
wood, makes a most pleasing appearance In
all the scenes, and strengthens the production
of "The Westerner" from the rise to the fall
of the curtain. The play is a comedy-drama
which deserves a crowded house. *j

â  Among the new things at the Orpbeum last
night were America's comedy duo. Ward and
Curran, who made an enthusiastic, hit, and
Guille, a late tenor of the Patli Opera Com

BOBBED TOOLBOXES.

Patrict Marshall, a laborer, 43 years of
age, was booked at the City Prison yester

Policeman M. T. Cooney on three charges
of petty larceny.

Tbe bill, he' said,, was' limited to a

The delegation to a State Democratic
convention at San Jose repudiated with
hisses and hoots the claim of the Examiner
to represent that party, and now, the
people are ready to repudiate its pretense
to represent San Francisco.
The exposure made by The Call of the
villainy of the Examiner has forced the
managers of that paper to drop their im
pudence and resort once more to hypoc
risy, but even that won't save them; we
propose to strip the masks off.
Every dollar which the blackmailers of
the Examiner can extort from corporations
serves as a fund to strengthen the gang in
levying backmail upon others. A common
interest requires that honest men should
combine to fight the villainy and crush it
oat.
Honest efforts to procure a reduction of
water and gas rates should not be dimin
ished because a notorious "gang of boodlcrs
are trying to take advantage of them for
their own nefarious profit. The Super
visors should go forward and do what is
right lor the public benefit. The people
will deal with the blackmailers until the
criminal courts get bold of them.
THE DISCREDITED BLACKMAILER.
- The Examiner has long been in discredit with the people of California. The ras
cality of its managers. hns been repeatedly exposed: So well known is the villainy of
its conduct that no ope .has confidence in it, though some are tempted to use it to
further their own ends. This condition of affairs has rendered Mr. Hearst desperate.
He has wasted the fortune left him by his father and is now trying to recoup himself
by such blackmailing schemes as the rascals in his employ can devise and carry out.
So long as Senator Hearst was alive the Examiner was. conducted as a representa
tive of the Democratic.party of California. After his death it continued to play that ;
role for a Jittle while. It was not long, however, before his wasteful and incompetent
son was made the dune of the vicious men around him and the paper then began to
' be used as an instrument to' extort' favors, subsidies and money from candidates for
office in the Democratic party. * In this way the Examiner was led into antagonism to
Senator White, and it opposed his candidacy for the United States Senate with tactics
which soon showed to the leaders of the Democratic party what sort of men they had
to deal with." ' .='â¢â¢'. - * â  '
When the Democratic State Convention assembled in San Jose the antagonism of
the Examiner to Senator White was at its bitterest degree, and the conduct of the
managers of the paper was fully made known to the delegates. The result was that
when one of the tools of that paper had the impudence to speak of it as a representa
tive of California Democracy he was booted and hissed by the delegates on the floor
and forced to leave the platform.
' .This act showed clearly that the Democratic party, or at least the leaders of the
party, had become aware of tbe true character of the men who were managing Willie
Hearst and his paper, aud had determined then and there to repudiate him, them
and it. Since that time the Examiner has had no standing as a representative of the
D mocratic party in the State', and it is now time to deprive it of the pretense of
representing any portion of the people of California.
Tnrough all the loud clamors of the Examiner for what it calls "popular interests
and the public welfare," there runs a tone of insincerity, which is evident in every
word it utters. . What shall we think of a paper claiming to oppose the Southern
Pacific monopoly, when it drew a subsidy of $1000 a month from the Southern Pacific
Company ? What shall we think of a paper pretending at this time to favor a reduc
tion in water and gas rates, when for years it haÂ« been silent on the subject?
... -.'.lt is known that the opposition to the railroad was due to the fact that the rail
road subsidy was cutoff, and it is an inevitable inference that the present opposition
to other corporations is due to the fact that subsidies hitherto drawn from them have
been also cut off. '..'.'..'
_*;â¢- With the tactics of a professional rascal, the Examiner attempts to evade public
indignation by charging others with offenses similar to its own. It has tried to cover
its blackmailing schemes by aspersing the honor of those who have exposed them.
Convicted of serving the monopoly, while pretending to be a friend of the people, it
now turns round and declares that the people of San Francisco have no friend among
the newspapers of the City, and that all are as wicked as the Examiner itself.
â  We have too much confidence in the intelligence of the people of San Francisco to
believe they can be duped aeain by this often exposed liar, boodler and blackmailer.
In posing as the organ of the Democratic party after death of Senator Hearst, it
had no other object*; than that of enriching its managers by the money it could extort
from Democratic politicians, and now in posing as a representative of the people of
.San Francisco it seeks only to compel rich corporations to-put money either into the
depleted purse of Willie Hearst, or into the stuffed pockets of Long Green Lawrence.
.â 'â¢â¢ We are well aware there are many reasons why honest men should hesitate to op
pose this infamous combination which controls the Ext miner. It is never an agreea
ble task to fight with an enemy which resorts to lies. slander;j_.and vilifications, in order
to silence an opponent or extort money. There is little honor to be gained from such
a contest. To kill a. reptile does not make a man a hero. Men therefore are averse to
enter a contest with the foul journal of the blackmailer and not infrequently pay trib
ute to it in order to escape its attacks.
The time has come, however, when these scruples should be put aside. Capital
should no longer be afraid of the blackmailer who attempts to plunder it. People
should no longer give support to the pretended friendship of an exposed hypocrite. A
combined effort should be made on the part of honest and decent people to rid the City
of this infamy once and for ail.
-There are reason*- to believe the struggle will not be a long one. Willie Hearst has
exhausted his father's fortune. He has been compelled to sell his interest in the Ana
conaa mine. He is at the end of the purse which enabled him to support a disrepu
table life, and a more disreputable newspaper. The attempts now to levy blackmail
in California are but the last despairing schemes of rascals who see before them pen
ury and the penitentiary. If the people act now with promptness and courage the
victory will be won, and this disreputable and disgraceful organ will soon be closed out
and. the blackmailers scattered as tramps on the highways.
TARIFF LEGISLATION.
.The Chamber of Commerce has pub
lished in a well-printed pamphlet the pro
ceedings of the recent tariff conference
held in this City with, the object of sup
plying information to â¢ Congress on th*
needs of California in the coming tariff
legislation. The work is well condensed,
can be easily read and will be of great
value to the representatives of California
in Congress in showing what .the indus
tries of the State require in the . way of
protective duties. â  .
The report adopted by the conference
calls attention to tbe fact that no State in
the Union is more vitally concerned in a
protective tariff than is California. In
all the fourteen schedules of the act of
1890 are to be found articles of California
production more or less affected by any
duty placed upon like articles of foreign
origin. These, as the report points out,
are our mines, our coal fields, our petro
leum and bitumen deposits, our forests
our agriculture, our flocks and herds of
domestic animals, our dairies, our fisher
ies and our factories.
The conference urges as an essential to
an intelligent and â¢ honest administration
of tariff legislation that the principle of
specific as against ad valorem duties be
adopted and applied in all cases wherever
practicable. The reasons for preferring
specific duties, are many. In the first
place, such duties enable the citizen to
learn at all times the exact competition he
has to meet, which he cannot do in the
case of ad valorem duties. It puts an end
to the evil of false valuations on imported
goods. -. Moreover, an apparently high ad
valorem duty is often found to be wholly
inadequate , for protection, inasmuch as
the percentage of duty is computed upon
the low valuation of foreign goods.
The.need of protection to our industries
is manifest from the fact that California
is exposed to competition coming from
British , Columbia, China, â¢ Japan and
Mexico. As Chinese labor is largely, used
in British Columbia, all of these countries
have very low rates of wages, and the
competition -is- destructive to the welfare
of American workingmen. . ''
The attention of Congress is called by
the conference to the necessity for some
legislation to promote the interests of
American shipping. As a means of doing
this, the. conference adopted a resolution
urging Congress that in arranging a new
tariff provision should be made for the
free entry of all materials actually used
for the" construed repairs, equipment
or subsistence of American-bum ships
employed in the foreign trade.
The greater portion of the pamphlet is
occupied by a ".review .of schedules giving
statements of the amount of protection
requested by representatives of the various
industries in the State. These statements
will enable our delegation in Congress to
work with a d finite purpose, before the
Ways and Means Committee. They make
clear exactly what California expects of
Congress in order that her industries may
be protected and the welfare of her work
ingmen .-and her' men of business- be
preserved. â¢
A curiosity in the way of postal routine
is reported by the Philadelphia Record.
The towns of -Langliorne and Eden, in
Pennsylvania, are so near together that,
their postoffices are only about 500 yards
apart. A letter from one of them to the
other, however, has to go byway of Phila
delphia, making a circuit of nearly forty
miles, and takes a day to do it.
So far a- we can gather from our ex
changes the only thing any part of the
country asks of Congress is to pass it's
particular appropriation- bill and then
quit. . â¢.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1897.
GENERAL ALGER.
No appointment to the McKinley Cabi
net is likely to give more general satisfac
tion to the people of the United States
than that of General Alcer to the office of
Secretary of War. No man in the country
is better fitted for the position by his
talents or past services, and we can ex
pect from the next administration- a
management of the War Department
which will be in every respect gratifying
to the country.
General Alger is one of the most emi
nent citizens of the Republic. He has
been for some time conspicuous as a can
didate for the Presidency and in several
Republican National conventions has
been the candidate from his State for
that high office. It was everywhere recog
nized that he would make a strong Presi
dent, and more than once he wa3 sup
ported in National conventions by a fol
lowing so strong as to make his nomina
tion probable. It has been rare in later
years that a man of his eminence accents
a Cabinet position, and his entry into the
McKinley administration will add to its
strength in every respect.
To the old soldiers of the Republic the
appointment will be especially pleasing.
General Alger was one of those volunteers
who went to the front with the Union
army, and rendered such distinguished
services on the field as to merit and re
ceive rapid and high promotion.' Few
volunteers in the army became more
eminent than he, and be is therefore a fit
representative of the soldier element of
the community and will be in his rightful
place at the head of the War Department
of the Government.
Since the close of the war General Alger
has devoted himself to business with
marked success. He has shown himself
to be as eminent in the conduct of civil
affairs as in those of war. He is a thorough
business man, honest, energetic and effi
cient. The success with which he has
conducted his private enterprises. attests
his skill as an administrator of large
affairs and' gives assurance to the public
that the War Department of the next
administration will be conducted with a
zeal and ability wnich will raise it to a
higher degree of efficiency than has ever
been known before.
From' the selections already made it is
evident that the McKinley Cabinet will be
one of the strongest we have ever known.
The men thus far selected have each a
marked and distinguished personality
which has made him well known to the
people. Each, moreover, has been chosen
for an office for which he is peculiarly
.fitted by his training and experience in
life. There is every reason for believing
â that the other members of the Cabinet,
"will be equally eminent. In such a galaxy
of distinguished men General Alger will
â¢occupy a prominent position. He will
not bo overlooked in the aggregation.
His parsonal force will keep him to the
front, and in the next administration the
average citizen will not have to turn to an
almanac, as he does now when he wishes
to find' out the name of the man who fills
the office of Secretary of War.
SHAM CIVIL SERVICE.
A speech recently delivered in Congress
by Hon. Henry M. Baker makes clearly
evident the hypocrisy of the Cleveland
administration in attempting to pose as
the advocates of civil service reform. The
speech is pertinent to the occasion as
some effort will undoubtedly be made to
induce President McKinley to right the
wrongs committed by Cleveland's Cabinet
, and restore our civil service to something
like a gocd condition before the "reform"
is fixed and established.
According to statements made by Mr.
Baker, the report of the Secretary of the
Interior for the first fourteen months ana
fifteen days after Hoke Smith took the
office shows that be made 817 appoint
ments, 171 reinstatements, 893 promo
tions, 422 reductions, 876 'dismissals,' and
88 "resignations by request." The dis
missals, resignations by request, and re
ductions were almost invariably of vet
erans and Republicans. . '
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury covering the first fourteen months
and twelve days after Secretary .Carlisle
took office showed there were 837 appoint
ments, 538 promotions, 637 dismissals, and
160 reductions. Of the 460 men dismissed,
129 were veterans, and two of the women
were old hospital nurses. Of the 140 men'
reduced, 54 were veterans, and 13 of the
women' were hospital nurse?.
Mr. Baker went on to point; out that at
the beginning of Cleveland's administra
tion the Secret Service Division was made
up about equally of Republicans and Dem
ocrats. . Now there is but one Republican
left in the division. In the Pension
Bureau 60 per cent of the employes are
Democrats; in the Fish Commission over
90 per cent; in the Government Printing
Office 66 per cent. "â '- .7
A similar condition prevails in every
department of the civil service. It is as
bad in San Francisco as elsewhere. The
most casual study of it shows how great
has been the sham of Mr. Cleveland's so
called civil service reform, and bow com
pletely he subordinated the service to
the interests of his friends.
The people, of this country are in favor
of what they understand as civil service
reform, but they are not in favor of the
sham reform of Cleveland. They may
consent to leave the service in tbe condi
tion to which he has brought it, but if
they do so it will simply be an act of self
df_*_hial on their part. They will not intend
thereby either to indorse his pretense as a
civil service reformer or to condone the
methods by which he has sought to give
life positions to the cuckoos and mug
wumps who supported his administra
tion.

Letters From the People.
MUNICIPAL HOUSING.
What Bas Been Dons in. Some' Large
Germ.m Cities,
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ
Perhaps I should state in a preliminary note
that my failure for a fortnight past to offer
further suggestions on municipal government
is due to my absence in the mines and not to a
â  oss of interest in the subject. Indeed, the
more familiar one becomes with what- has been
done by the older progressive cities of the
world for the -general welfare, noting the
happy results which always follow even the
most startling innovations, tho greater and
deeper the interest one feels in this vital prob
lem of the present hour, the rational manage-
. ment of municipal affairs in large cities.
Municipal housing claims our attention in
this "letter. On page 355 of Albert Shaw's ad
mirable book on "Municipal Government in
Europe," we are told ihat "all rough stud
ents of the problem of life in modern cities
are now agreed that the housing of the people
is the question that requires from this time
forth the deepest consideration and the boldest
and most serious treatment," and only super
ficial minds will dissent from this conclusion.
A few fasts will help us here. "Iv 1885 it
was found that 73,000 Dei-sons in the city of
Berlin were living In. the families occupying a
single room in tenement houses; 382.000 were
living in two-room tenements; 432,000 in
three-room apartments anil 398. occupied
four-room habitations." Now, "although the
one-room dwellers were only about one-sixth
as many as the three-room dwellers, their rate
of mortality was twenty-three times as high,
and thirty-three times greater than that of the
four-room occupants." â 'â /â â¢'.' ".
Mr. Shaw makes this further comparison:
The total population of Berlin in 1885 was
1,315,00.0, and "the 73,000 people Who lived
in the one-room quarters suffered nearly half
the entire number of deaths of the whole
population. Their' death-rate - was 163.5 per
1000, nearly one-sixth of their entire number,
while the two- room dwcllerssustaiued a death
rate of on'.y 22 5, the three-room dwellers only
7.5. and the tour-room people lost only 5.4 per
1000 of the population." He adds that "half
ttie mortality of the Berlin one-room dwellers
occurred In households where five or more
persons occupied the one enclosed space."
Important results immediately followed
this minute statistical investigation in 1885.
Drastic rules were at once adopted by the
municipality for the construction of tene
ment-housesâone requiring that at least
a third part of the lot / hould.be left unbuilt
upon as a court space for air aud light; an
other forbidding the construction oi apart
ments containing less than a prescribed num
ber of cuDic feet of enace and ' requiring
proper provision for daylight, ventilation and
heating, while the tenement-houses already
occupied were brought under strict municipal
authority, and in various ways the evils oi
overcrowding were lessened and the average
character of the housing of the poorer classes
greatly improved.
But a more important result of the statisti
cal inquiry of 1885, causing immediate action
of the municipality to protect the- poor from
the avarice oi landlords and the city from
the devastation oi epidemics, was the im
mense impulse given to a movement to create
Greater Berlin. To this end the municipal au
thority proceeded to lay off the adjacent ter
ritory and prescribe exactly the character of
the houses that property-owners might erect.
On this point Mr. Shaw remarks that "such
regulations may seem irksome, yet all cities
must come to the conclusion that the rights
of the -masses in crowded communities are
superior to the whims of individuals; that
the pretense that private ownership of land
carries with it any absolute right to disregard
the general welfare is a baneful heresy which
is not to be tolerated when it asserts its impu
dent claims." . â 
On page 361 we are told that "all the other
leading German cities btve made similar sta
tistical investigations, and most of them are
endeavoring to reform the evils which they
now fully comprehend." However, bright as
the future of these German cities now serins
to be in the sanitary housing of people who
can never look forward to the day when they
shall have homes of their own, but must Al
ways live in hired tenements, still it must be
conceded that these cities have much yet to
do before they are the equals of Glasgow and
Paris in the humane and practical relief af
forded the more abject poor, and more espe
cially do they seem to lack the divine benevo
lences incarnated in the municipal life of
Glasgow and Pnris, which protect, educates,
clothes and feeds the little children of the
hapless and helpless poor.

A LIT -LB LOoT BIRD.
Story of a Sioux Papoose Found on a Battle
field.
The adopted daughter of Mrs. Clark Bewick
Colby, the eminent suffragist who yesterday
addressed the New Citizens' Club in this city
in the Assembly-room of the Young Women's
Christian Association, is a full-blooded Sioux
Indian, says the Pittsburg Dispatch.
The babe was rescued from its dead moth
er's arms four days after the noted battle at
Wounded Knee Creek, in South Dakota, six
years ago this month. Colonel Colby was in
the charge made by the United States troops
against the Indians at that time. '
After the battle was over "nothing that wore
Little Lost Bird.
a blanket was alive." The slaughter of the
Indians was terrific. The next day a terrible
blizzard set in, and for four days the
dead were left alone in the ravine where the
battle had waged.
On the fourth day the babe was discovered.
A bullet had killed the squaw, but as she fell
she had gathered her blanket closely about
the child. This*, with the heavy covering of
snow, had kept the baby warm. It was almost
perished from hunger, but soon rallied when
placed in the care of some Indian women.
As the women crooned over it. and slowly
nursed it back to life they constantly wailed,
'â¢Z-i ntka Laununi," meaning "poor lost bird."
Colonel Colby and wife, who have no family,
were touched by the Incident, and as the
parents of the babe, both lull-blooded Sioux,
ad both perished In the battle, negotiations
were made for the purchase of the little one.
This was accomplished, and for six years little
Zintka has been cared for with devotion by
her foster parents.
Zintka attends kindergarten now, and the
differences between her and other little
ones have not yet been marked enough for
comment. In disposition at home and in the
kindergarten she is *extremely affectionate,
willful, but amenable to reason. She isa
model Sunday-school baby, and asks ques
tions on her spiritual being niter the simili
tude of other bright children. She is loud
of music, and in her baby fashion makes
harmony on the piano. One peculiarity, how
ever, is her ability to road the thoughts of
those about her. She has oh several occasions
inierpreted looks from strangers and impetu
ously answered their unspoken inquiry in her
own baby fashion. She is as obe .icnt, Mrs.
Colby says, as any little lassie, in a favored
home. Her skin is brunette and her hair,
long and silky, readily yields to the civilizing
curlpapers. .
COMPETENCY OF W.LL-MAKERS
Philadelphia Ledger.
. A device for preventing unseemly will con
tests has appeared in Connecticut and is being
very favorably com men tod on. It provides
that the testator, on making his will; may de
posit It witn a legal officer and give public no
tire of the fact in order that' any person who
may doubt his competence to make a will may
come forward and test the question within
a certain time. If no objection is made
witnin the time specified 'the will*' cannot be
attacked on that ground when offered for pro
late. Nobody is to see the will or knOw its
route - ; .the inquiry is to be confined to .the
single question of the maker's competence,
perhaps including the question of undue in
ence; but if these two points can be. settled
during his life there la little danger of a sue-,
cessful attempt to break the will after' his
death. Ii seems as if a great deal of -scandal
and much unseemly litigation migiu. be pre
vented by this simple device. - . â¢

Highbinderâ X. i". Z., City. The latest dic
tionaries say that "highbinder is a slang term
of no special meaning." It was probably used
in the sense of high as high in "high jinks" or
"high old time," and "binder" is probably a
transition from "bender," which was used to
describe going on a spree. .In tho general
acceptation it is used to designate a bold, roy
stering rowdy, such as in California is desig
nated as a hoodlum. The Century Dictionary
says: "Highbinders, so called,, were known
in New York, Baltimore and other cities be
fore 1849. In that year and subseqaently
they became familiar in California. At present
the name is used' only as to members of a
Chinese secret society, band or gang, said to
exist in California and other parts of the
United States, associated r for tne purpose of
blackmailing and even for â¢assassination in
the interest and pay of societies or'indi
viduals." The dictionary then quotes the
following from the New York Semi-weekly
Tribune of May 20, 1887, 10 show the first use
of the word in the sense described: .*-â Â£â *"
"?ui*y (.urn, the Chinese woman, was finally re
leased from the embezzlement charge broucht
against her by the highbinders.
The term highbinder may nave been in use
in New York, Baltimore und other Eastern
cities prior to 1849, but in the early da's Â« of'
California it was unknown, aud In none of the
histories of any rowdyism In 1849 and a lew
years thereafter docs the term appear.
An extract from the testimony taken before
the joint special committee that held its in-
IS".^-. I*o1 * 0^ 1 *- the J'^ace Hotel in this City in
18/0. in October, shows that the term was
used as applied to Chinese prior to the date of
the Tribune extract quoted. On the 2tith of
October Thomas H. King, a merchant, testified
aud used the wo.d highbinder, as appears
from the folio*? ing. on page 94 of the report of
the committee: . * ' '
What do you mean by "-highbinder?" asked
Sena or Sargent.
l mean men who fire employed by the Chinese
companies hereto hound and spy upou the i hi
nese and pursue them. I have often heard it ap
plied to bad men: Sometimes they are employed
to assassinate Chinese. If a Chinaman has broken
a contract and attempts to leave san Francisco he
wl.I be Anally Stopped at the steamer on the day
of sailing by the large fotcet.f the company's high
binders who can always be seen guarding them.
. The use of the word .highbinder applied to
Cninese in San Francisco (toes bacK further
than that. In 1669 or '70 Delos Woodruff,
then a special in Chinatown, in later years
Couniy Judga of Josephine County, Or., was a
witness in tne Police Court in a case when he
declared that "a lot of highbinders came
around," and b*Â»in*t asked by the Jud*re to ex
plain tbat term, snid that it was a name that
was given to Chinese rowdies, robbers und .
murderersâ men who wore stiff fiai-rimraed
black hats and were known as "hatchet-mon"
among the Chinese. The term had beta -In
use in the Chinese quarter by officers lor some
time before that.
Highbinder has also been used in England'
to designate an athlete, such as a circus tum
bler and jumper. The term was also applied
to horses that jump hurdles and ditches or
steeplechasers. . . â¢''â *-*â "*â *>;â < - - '*.

VESSELS RAN FOR

\
The people who live at Point Reyes must
have been treated to a pretty sight yester
day morning. Three vessels were all beat
ing their way to San Francisco, and when
the southeaster came up they had to put
about and make for the open sea. One of
the vessels was the British ship King Ed
ward, from Newcastle, Australia. An
other was tbe bark Santiago, 18 days from
I Hilo, H. 1., and the third was the barken
tine S. G. Wilder, from Honolulu. The
bark and the barkentine were towed in
during the day by the tugs Vigilant and
Reliance, but the King Edward is still
I outside, and the Swanhilda may yet beat
her into port". .- 'Â«*JSO__f!|
' Captain John Silovich of the Vigilant
was close to the vessels when the storm
came up, and he says that when tney put
about and scudded away off shore it was
one of the prettiest sichts ever saw.
On the wav up from Hilo Captain John
son of the Santiaco. sighted a square-rig
ger, but could not make out her name, It
may be the Swanhilda, and yet again it
may be the O.ivebank or one of half a
dozen other square-riggers now fully one.
Op board the- Santiago on January 27
Oscar Rygh, one of the sailors, fell from
the fore topsail yard to the deck and was
almost, instantly killed. He was buried
at sea.
Trade between San Francisco and the
Columbia River ' seems to have fallen off.
Some time ago the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company was compelled to
tie up the steamer Oregon in Richard
sons "Bay and the Columbia and State of
California did ail the work. Now for a
week at least the State will have to do the
work alone, as yesterday,' instead of going
out on her usual run, the Columbia was
taken to the Union Iron Works for a gen
eral overhauling. Another vessel for As
toria and Portland: will not leave until
next Sunday. ' Competition in the shape
of steam schooners has been very keen,
and freight and passengers have been car
ried at a dead loss.
The ferry steamer Oakland was laid up
for repairs yesterday and the Newark took
her place. The Garden City was put on
the creek route and will remain there until
the Oakland is ready for service again.
The English mail for Australia is again
late and the chances are that the Oceanic
Steamship Company's Monowai will not
get away for Sydney before midnight
Thursday, and it may be Friday morning.
Captain Carey of the" vessel is a very sick
man at the Occidental and Chief Engineer
Mc-Kaig has been confined to his room
aboard the ship for a week. Both gentle
.men are in hopes of being well aram by
sailing day. '
John Oppenheim, the well-known water
front merchant, had- an experience last
Saturday night that he will not forget in a
hurry. Captain Currie of the Elsie wanted
seven men to take the place of the muti
neers now in the hands of the United
States Marshal, and Oppenheim agreed to
get them. . He succeeded and took them
out to the vessel, off Black Point, in order
to get the money to pay their advance ;
notes. It was raining and blowing hard
and everybody got drenched. At the last
moment one of tbe men refused to sign,
and he had to be sent ashore and another
brought out to fill his place. By
the time everything was straightened
out it was 1:30 a. "M. and Oppen
heim had to face the storm, again
as the schooner was getting under way.
His boatmen worked hard but could make
no headway, and the Whitehall began to
fill. The passenger had to take off his. hat
and bail out while Murray and his assist
ant did all in their power to stem the tide.
"Put me ashore, boys, and. I will give each
of you a new suit of clothes," said the now
thoroughly frightened merchant, and just
at that time there was a let up in the
storm and the boatmen managed to make
a landing a little below Meiggs wharf. Mr.
Oppenheim at once took a hack, reaching
home about 3a. m., just in time to meet
his wife and sou, who were bound for the
water front to look for him. ''It was the
wildest night I ever encountered," said he
yesterday, "and. l' will never go out on the
bay in another such storm again."
l)ominick Roberts, â¢ the well-known
water-front commission merchant, wss
rejoicing yesterday over the recovery of
a â¢ watchchain that has been ont of his
pos-ession for five months or more. When
he was staying in the El Monte Hotel lan
summer, jewelry to the value of over ."500
was stolen from his room, and Constable
Maber of Mill Valley offered to recover
il.-. In order to identify the stolen prop
erty he took along Mr. Roberts' chain to
compare it with the other trinkets. This
was five months ago, and, in spite of the
fact that Roberts, wrote several times ask
ing for the return of the chain, he could
get no satisfaction': Then he swore out a
bench warrant, and Maher failed to ap
pear. , Later, however, he showed up and
returned- the chain, and Robert's' ex
hibited it with pride to all his brother
merchants along, the front. Maber has.
however, got even in a certain way. He
has tola all his' friends and also the
people who travel- on the Sausaiito route
' that he was arrested at the instance of a
Japanese. -.
The ship Oriental made a phenomenal
run from San Francisco to Departure Bay.
She left here on January 26, and accord
ing to advices received by the Merchant**'
Exchange reached her destination on the
30ih. Steamers take all the way from
eighty-five to ninety hours making the
Same run,* so the Oriental must have car
ried a southeast gale with her the entire
way. '
CRIMINAL LIBEL
Captain- Anderson of the Mail Dock
Has David C. Craig Arrested.
* David C Craig, an employe on the Pa
cific Hail dock, appeared in Judge Con
lan's court yesterday to answer a charge
of libel' preferred against him by Captain
J. F. Anderson, the superintendent.
The libel was contained in a letter al
leged to have been sent by Craig on De
cember 21 to R. P. Schwerin, the man
ager. In the letter it was charged that
Anderson had, with the connivance of
employes on the dock, been stealing bags
of coffee and other articles, and taking*
them to his private residence for use.
Captain Anderson denies the allegations,
and claim*! that he has been maliciously
libeled. _-ffs_9

PAYMENT MADE EASY.
City Treasurer "iVidber and County-
Clerk Curry Co-Operate for the
Public Convenience.
City Treasurer Widber has introduced
an innovation that will be appreciated by
attorneys and others having business with
County Clerk Curry.
Since the fee bill of 1895 was put in
force it has been necessary for litigants to
walk about a quarter of a mile in paying
fees to the County Treasurer for filing pa
pers in.the County Clerk's office.
Beginning yesterday Treasury Widber
stationed one of his deputies in Clerk Cur
ry's office for the uurpose of receiving all
such fees. By this arraneemen". business
is expedited and there is less inconve
nience suffered by lawyers ana litigants.
Ex-Assemblyman Joseph Winrow has
been appointed receiving clerk for the
Treasurer in this new position. .
lOEGERY IS OHAEGED.
A Check That Uas Led Charles I-.
White Into Trouble.
Charles L. White was arrested yester
day afternoon by Detective Ross Whitaker
and Policeman T. P. Walsh on the charge
of forgery.
Sunday he obtained $10 from A. W.
Lindsay, 73 Fourth street, on a check for
$675 drawn on the Bank of California, pay
able to C. L. White and signed, "Miller &
Lux, by J. A. Nicholson, manaeer."
Lindsay presented the checkat the bank
yesterday morning and it was pronounced
. a forgery. He then called at Miller &
Lux's office, and J. O. Nickle,. the man
ager, told him the same thing. The police
were notified and White was arrested.
Detective Whitaker says tnat he arrested
White four or five years ago on a similar
charge. He passed a forged check for a
small amount, drawn upon a bank in
Reno, Nev., but owing to the expense of
bringing witnes~>e*> from such a distance
the case fell through.
BABCOCK DRAWS HIS PAY
The Contestant for the Super
â¢ intendence/ Makes Violent
Protest.
Auditor Broderick Says the Law Cited
in the Latter's Behalf Is
Irrelevant.
Auditor Broderick yesterday audited
the warrants of Superintendent of Schools
Babcock ana bis appointees, despite the
tiro.test of B>. H. Webster, who is contest
ing the office, having. received tbe greater
number of votes at the late election.
A protest was made last month, but too
late to prevent the Auditor signing the
warrants. The protest came earlier this
month and the Auditor called for authori
ties in law upon which the protest was
based and a number of these were cited by
(jarber Garber, Webster's attorneys.
The Auditor, after examining these de
cided that they .were irrelevant. The
point principally relied upon, he says,
was that Babcock held office by virtue of
his appointment only until the "next
regular election." .The Supreme Court in
the case of Lynch vs. Budd, wherein this
same point was raised with regard to
Lieutenant-Governor Jeter, quoted a case
from Florida which, held that:
Where It is declared that the City Council
shall nil vacancies- until the next regular
'election, it means until tne next regular
election provided by the charier for electing
the officer whose term has become vacant.
The Superintendent of Schools ia elected
only at gubernatorial elections, and no
such election has oc.urcd since then, he
save.
It was also urged that .when an office
was in contest, no salary should be paid
until it -was decided who was entitled to
the office. The amendment of tbe law,
March 10, 1891, Broderick says, covers that,
and requires the Auditor to audit the bill of
the person holding the certificate of elec
tion and performing the duties of the
office. Notwithstanding Babcock and his
appointees are getting their salary and as
Webster is not, Webster, he says, will
receive all of the salary due him in a lump,
in case the court decides in his favor. He
says Webster has not yet made a claim for
salary, and that he must do so within
thirty days, or the claim will be void.
Following is the 1891 amendment re
ferred to:
When the title of the incumbent of any
ofiice in this State is contested by proceedings
instituted In any court for that purpose,
warrant can thereafter be drawn or paid for
any part of his salary until such proceedings
bavo been finally determined; provided, how
ever, ihat this section shall not be construed
to apply to any party to a contest or proceed
ing now pending or hereafter instituted, who
hods a certificate of election or commission
of office and discharges the duties of the office;
bui men party shall receive the salary of such
office, the same as if no such contest or pro
ceeding was ponding.

SCHUSSLER BACK
FROM EUROPE
Strange Discoveries in the
Water of the Famous
River Elbe.
The Kind of Drink With Which
Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen .
. . Are Supplied.
Something About Bacteria, the Su
perb Plumbing of Ancient Rome
and California Water.
Herman Schussler, . engineer of the
Spring Valley Water Company, has re
turned here after four and a half months'
absence in different parts of the East and
Europe. He went partly for rest, after
three years of uninterrupted hard work,
and to see all the newest improvements in
hydraulic engineering, and particularly to
look into the water supplies of different
cities.
Mr. Schussler visited Germany, Den
mark, Norway. Sweden and Italy, and had
an extremely pleasant trip. In 1863 and
1 SGI Mr. Schnssler was a student at the
Polytechnic School at Carisruhe, in.Baden.
When he visited Baden this time he met
several of his old schoolmates and two of
his former professors. At the request of
the faculty he delivered a lecture on the
progress of American engineering, the
supplies of water here and irrigation. Pie
also delivered two lectures at Bremen and
Hamburg on similar subjects.
The investigations which he made while
abroad are of considerably more than or
dinary interest. He examined into the
systems of the leading cities in order that
any improvements they had might be
adopted here.
"Among the most prominent water
works of Germany I thoroughly investi
gated those of Berlin, Hamburg and
Bremen," said Mr. Schussler. "I found
the new water works of Hamburg, con
structed since the cholera of 1893, with its
enormous filters, basins and pump stations,
to be one ot the finest anywhere. Ham
burg gets its water from the Elbe, which
drains an enormous country, comprising
the central part of Prussia and the
whole of the kingdoms of Saxony and
Bohemia.,
"There are also many large cities on the i
Elbe above Hamburg, the largest ones j
being Magdeburg. Dresden and Prague, j
Bohemia forms tne headwaters of the
Elbe, and these three large cities and a
number of smaller cities and villages dis- |
cbarge their sewage into the Elbe, and the j
waste and offal from thousands of manu
factories and from all the vast area of
farming land go dowu tbis river. It '
should be remembered - that this vast i
region is inhabited by teeming millions of
people.
. "Bremen is similarly situated to Ham
burg; except that the watershed of tbe !
river Weser, from which it gets its water j
supply, is -smaller, but is almost as densely
populated as the watershed ot the Elbe.
"Berlin draws its water from the Havel, j
Spreeand some of the lakes through which '
these rivers run. Ou their course they
also drain a densely populated country,
in addition to extensive peat swamps.
"In all the three casosâ Berlin," Ham- .
burg and Bremenâ the water is first lifted
with low-lift pumps out of the respective
rivers into settling basins, in which it de
posits a certain per cent of its filth. From
there it runs by gravitation into tbe sand
filter-beds, when it passes rough layers
of sand - varying from four to five feet in
thickness, and thus filtered it runs into
the pump-wells, from which the high
level" pumps draw it and force it Into
standpipes, irom which it flows into the
respective city pipe systems.
"By the above system of sand-filtering
the water works are trying to reduce the
number of bacteria, which in the river
Weser, for instance, near Bremen, had
been known at times to exceed 200,000,000
to the American gallon,' down to the Gov
ernment standard of 378,000 bacteria to the
American gallon. Frequently one filter
ing is not sufficient to do this, and so a
double filtering has to be resorted to.
."Thus the water is mechanically
cleansed of most ot its living and dead im
purities, but no attempt whatever is made
to cleanse it of any of the chemical im
purities that have been discharged into
the rivers on the watershed above, and
the chemical analysis is practically
dropped out of their investigations.
"As regards the pumping plants in those
cities I found very hne machinery, but
from the point of the coal economy the
engineers In our works here are consider
ably ahead of those in European cities.
"When in the lectures I gave I de
scribed the water works here, and showed
that they owned or controlled the largest
proportion of their watershed, the best
experts there pronounced it a very unique
and unusually favorable case of Water sup
ply to a large city, as it gave an oppor
tunity to control . the purity of the water,
while they, with their large cities, had to
take such water from their respective
rivers as flowed down to them from the
above described densely populated coun
tries.
"I had an interesting trip thronch Den
mark and parts of Sweden and Norway,
and returned through Germany by way
of Rome and Naples. In Rome I had an
opportunity to again visit its magnificent
water works,'- old and new, which are
always interesting to see. In .one of
the large houses lately excavated in
Pompeii I probably saw one of the most
interesting examples of ancient plumbing
extant. This building, called the Casa
Nuovp, which has a large courtyard, with
.fountains and statues, had a perfect sys
tem.of inch and three-fourths inch lead
pipe laid through the courtyard, showing
wiped joint connections where the smaller
branches were soldered on to the larger
pipes and most perfect bronze stopcocks,
about three-fourths of an inch in size, and
made just as perfect as any at the present
day, and serviceable to this day, after
having been buried under thirty-five feet
of ashes or pumice stone for more than
ISOO years. These branch pipes, each
with a bronze stopcock, led to statuettes
in the four corners of the courtyard and
the stream issuing from a shell or other
ornaments in the hand of these statuettes
had been discharging into a basin in front
of them. A few days after .my visit on
November 27 some royal personages
were expected and some plumbers were
laying one-inch lead pipe from a modern
hydrant, 200 or 300 feet away, to connect
the same with the ancient pipe system,
and make the fountains play again, after
a rest of 1817 years. To me it was a sin
gularly strange and interesting sight.
"On my way home, after reaching New
York, I stopped in New Orleans. I also
visited the water works there, where they
pump the water out of the Mississippi
River direct into the pipe system without
an intermediate filtration. Owing to the
muddy character of the Mississippi River
water at most seasons of the year large
filter beds would he very difficult and ex-,
pensive to maintain, as they would choke
up a sand filter very rapidly."
Mr. Schussler made interesting investi
gations regarding bacteria in the water.
It has been found, strange as it may
seem, that seme of the queer animal
life found in water i* essential to health.
The only thing is there must not be too
many of a kind. How to keep the right
proportion is now a subject that is com
manding the attention of the foremost
scientists in this particular field of inves
tigation. Mr. Schussier has brought with
him some of the latest German illustrated
scientific works on the subject. He has
his own jars of water, and frequently
makes Investigations by aid of powerful
microscopes.
A FIREMAN AT REST.
Last Honors Paid to the Memory
of the Lata John L.
Durkee.
Members of the Exempt Company an.
Monumental Aid Association
Among tbe Mourners.
The funeral of the late John L. Durkee
took place yesterday morning at an early
hour from St. Bridgid's Church, on Van
Ness avenue near Broadway. The church
wan crowded with those who had known
Mr. Durkee in his lifetime, and there was
present a delegation of the Exempts in
uniform and a funeral detail from
the Monumental Aid Association, of
which the deceased was one of the oldest
members.
The remains, encased in a handsome
casket covered with black cloth, was ear
ned into the church by . the following
named, who were the active pallbearers:
James Riley, William H. Martin, Wash
ington Irvine, James O'Donnell. A. G.
Griffith aud. John M. Fisher. High mass
was celebrated by Rev. Father Cottle, as
sisted by Fathers Ryan, Sullivan and
Ramon. During the offertory ilons.
Charles Pechin sang the celebrated "Pro
Peccatis," from Rossini's "Stabat Mater";
Joseph Roeckei's "Benedictus" was sung
.after the Elevation, by Mme. Ellen
Coursen-Roecitcl, Senorita Andrea Mojica,
Herr Ed Lotz and Mons. Pechin ; after
the Agnus, Chopin's inspired "Elegy
was rendered in a very effective manner,
by Mme. Coursen-Roeckel. 7 .'.;
At the close of the impressive service
the remains of the veteran fireman were
taken to Calvary Cemetery, laid to rest,
and the mourner*, and his former com-
panions in the ranks of the volunteer de
partment paid the last honors. /*:..
The funeral was extremely simple in its
character, and. was in accordance, with the
expressed wish of Mr. Durkee shortly, be
fore bis death. There were but few floral
tributes, a request having been made that
none be sent, still there was an exception,
one offering beine a pillow oi violets, a
tribute from the teachers of the Polytech
nic High School, to the staff of which
Miss Bessie Durkee, daughter of the de
ceased, belongs. The chief mourners were
the widow, her two daughters and. son
and two nephews, William and Hamilton
Morton. 7:'. -
DESPONDENCY. AND DEATH.
Why Jacob Ahrens, su felderly Saloon
keeper, Committed Suicide.
Jacob H. Ahrens, who for thirty years
past conducted a saloon at 205 Commercial
street, committod suicide on Sunday night
at his place of business in a fit of despond
ency. Ahrens had been informed that the
I building in . which the saloon is situated
would soon .be torn down to make room
for a new structure, and that he must find
quarters elsewhere. He brooded over the
matter for several days and then decided
on death.
He was found by his son yesterday morn
ing in a rear room of the saloon asphyxi
ated. Before turning on the gas Ahrens
bad carefully closed his place. Deceased
was 60 years of age, a native of Germany
and leaves a widow and children. He was a
member of the Odd Fellows and of a num
ber of German societies.

Professor Christy's Interesting
Lecture at the Academy
of Sciences. .
A Large' Audience of Miners and
Students Learn the History and
App' ication of the Process.
At the Academy of Sciences last night
an interesting lecture was delivered on
the "Cyanide Process of Gold Extraction"
by Samuel B. Chr.sty, professor of mining
and metallurgy at the University of Cali
fornia. . â¢ ' .. ;â¢â¢;, â¢".; .':.*.*;
The hall was crowded with a mixed
audience of students and practical miners.
The professor's remarks, which were
-illustrated throughout by means of the
stereopticon, tended to prove the. many
advantages of. the cyanide process in the
treatment, moro particularly of the finer
grades of ore. He* stated that in South
Africa, where the process was introduced
several years ago, it has effected an im
mense saving in tailings which could not
be profitably worked by any other method
previously adopted. â¢ In 1890 the value of
the cyanide product for the Witwatersrand J
district was $6000; in-1891,? 60,000; In 1392,
$3,000,000, and in 1894 $6,000,000, and it is
still increasing. ." * 7'- *. â â '
The lecturer after rapidly reviewing the
results achieved by himself and others
notably. T. E. Eichbaum, C. W. Merrill,
Leslie Simpson, H. C. Baldwin, F. Booth
and E. A. Hersamâ in the course of inves
tigations pursued in California, proceeded
to describe the actual process as clearly
and as simply as the necessarily technical
nature of the subject . permitted. ' He
spoke first * of the most . satisfactory
methods of dissolving the gold in
cyanide solutions and afterward of the
various methods of securing gold precipi
tation from these solutions. The solubility
of gold in cyanide solutions had been
known, he stated, for nearly a. century,
though that knowledge was not actually
applied for purposes of gold extraction
until ten years ago. In 1848 the German
chemist Ellsner declared that while zinc
would dissolve in a potassium |cyanide
solution the presence of oxygen was nec
essary in the case of the nobler metals.
J. 8. MacArtbur who claims to have, in
vented -.the cyanide process, denied
Ellener's contentions, though as the
result of personally conducted experi
ments, the. lecturer had seen fit to con
firm the Ellsner reaction.
Mr. Christy discussed the effects of ox
idizing agents, and affirmed that his con
clusion after three years' study was that
with low-grade ores and diluted solutions
the cyanide solution itself will, if properly
aerated, carry oxygen enough to dissolve
the gold.
The lecturer, in the course of his expla
nation of the various methods of precipi
tation from the solution, discussed the
use of electricity, of metallic zinc and
of copper. The first-named method,
in spite of several disadvantages,
has been more generally ' used on
a large scale than any other. In this
connection, be pointed out a curious fact
discovered during the treatment of a solu
tion containing. 0.1 per cent, or $603 per
ton of gold. -Plain strips ot polished zinc
failed to induce the slightest precipitation,
whereas when lathe turnings from the
same. sheet zinc were used, the gold was
entirely precipitated by filtration of the
solution through a large excess of zinc
shavings. .;;
Several views of the largest plants in
Utah, California and South Africa, where
the process is in operation, were subse
quently thrown unon the screen and
rapidly described. In closing his address
the speaker advised miners to save tail
ings even as low as 50 cents per ton, which
could be profitably treated -by the cyanide
process. ______________________________________________________

Mrs. Weyle testified' that .she is living
*' with her husband ' whom she married in
Jackson,. Amador County, about three
months ago. She admitted that she nad
moved several times since coming to this
City, but said that was because her hus
band wanted her to do so. She denied
that she had done anything wrong.
Fred Sharon, an engineer in the San
* Francisco Fire Department, testified that
he and his former wife were divorced in
Nevada and he came to San Francisco,
where he obtained a position as engineer
in the Fire Department. After about two
years he wrote to his wife to come to San
Francisco and he would marry her again.
He met her in Sacramento and suggestea
to her that he would like to have some
1 assurance that. she was going to do right.
It was very expensive, this marrying and
getting divorced, so his pian : was for
them to live together for a year.' and if.at
the end of that term of probation both
were satisfied it would be time enough to
have another -ceremony performed. She

which they. lived with the little child

man who would make such vulgar and
low comparisons as are attributed to Mr.
Jordan must be utterly destitute of

appears in the prints, he is not only un

but unreasonable and unscientific. I

Robert Weincke, bookkeeper of the
Golden West Hotel, testified that on the
21st of last month at about 5:30 o'clock in
the morning he was aroused by a noise
and he went upstairs, where he found
Mr. Weyle breaking in the transom of
Mrs. Weyle's . room. Weyle called
Weincke to bear witness that there was a
man in his wife's room. The door was
opened, and sure enough there was a man
in the room, but he had on his hat and
overcoat ana walked out of the house.
Ernest Weyle' corroborated the story
about breaking in the transom and find
ing in the room a man from the town of
Jackson. He said he only wanted to de
mand an cxulanation, but was too angry
to listen to anything that was said to
him. He appeared to have been satisfied
subsequently, however, as he and his wife
are again living together.
"Is it the custom for the gentlemen of
Jacksan to call on their lady friends at
half- past 5 in the morning?" asked Attor
ney Tauzsky.
Judge Cook thought that the social cus
toms of Jackson were immaterial so far
as the present case was concerned.
Attorney Anson Hilton represented the
mother and was assisted by Attorney T.
J. Butts. They took turns about in grill
ing Sharon, th** former husband of Mrs.
Weyle. Sharon's action in taking his
former wife to live with him without the
formality of a remarriage was commented
on with severity.
Frank E. Sharon, a brother of the child's
father, was allowed to testify in his own
defense on the accusation that he had
used undue force to get possession of the
child. He said that he did nothing more
than help hold her while the officers took
the little one from the room.
When asked why he thought Mrs. Weyle
was an unfit and dangerous person "to
have the custody of the little girl he re
ferred to what he had heard about her re
cent acts and added that shi* had threat
ened to. kill herself and the child if the
little one should ever be taken from her.
This latter remark pleased Mrs. Weyle's
attorneys, as they thought it but a mani
festation of her love for her offspring.
Judge Cook said -that there was some
testimony before the court that by infer
ence . could be held to show that Mrs.
Weyle had been indiscreet, to say the
least, but the incident at the Golden West
had not demonstrated any guilt on her
part, Sa far as her living with her former
husband in this City after they had been
divorced, and without a remarriage, that
could not -be held against her with any
greater force than attainat the father of the
child. In this ' regard both were equally
blameworthy. The court might award
the custody of the child to a third party,
but when the little one was of sucn ten
der age he would hold that the mother
was the proper custodian, no matter what
the mother might have done.

JURORS' MEALS MAY
RAISE A RUCTION
License Committee of the
Supervisors "Roasts"
the Judges.
The Issue Is Whether the City
Shall Pay ior "Chops and
Tomato Sauce."
On One Side Are Threats of Criminal
Action, and Upon the Other
Side Sarcasm.
Tbe Board of Supervisors yesterday
afternoon listened to a little "roast" of
the Superior Judges, who have agreed that
the jurors In criminal cases must have
their meals supplied to them by the City
and County, notwithstanding that the
Judiciary Committee of the board has de
cided that demands 'for such meals will
not be audited. The "roast" was admin
istered by the Judiciary Committee. It
was incidental to a report containing
other matters. That part of the report
which referred to th** announced inten
tion of the Superior Judges is as follows:
Referring to the communication from Judge
Cooic ol the Superior Court, stating that he
will disregard the provisions of resolution No.
15,702 (third series, in the matter of meals for
trial jurors, your committee deem it to be a
matter of regret tnat the Judges of our crim
inal courts cannot appreciate the situation.
The large expenditures made during the cur
rent fiscal year on account of jurors, simply
for attendance, whether they perform jury
duty or not, make it appear reasonable to pre
sume that.they should, for their meals as
they would have to do under other conditlone.
There the matter stands and may stand
for several days. Whether the jurors will
have "chops and tomato sauce" or other
viands at the expense of the City and
County will very soon be determined;
The Supervisors voted some weeks ago
not to pay any such bills after February
1. Meanwhilo the Superior Judges have
intimated that, if the City and County
officials prevent the feeding of the jurors
they will become amenable to prosecution
under the Civil Code. -^
On the other hand it is said that the
provision for paying the jurors a per diem
has been enacted since the Criminal Code
proposition went into effect.
The committee yesterday made other
recommendations concerning jurors as
follows:
In tie matter of demands for service or at
tendance as jurors in the criminal depart
ments of the feupenor Court It Is also recom
mended that the opinion of the City and
County Attorney be requested as to whether
or not, in those cases where the persons
named are delinquent for State, City or County
taxes, they be required to pay delinquent
taxes belore the said demands are allowed;
also whether. the board can deduct from said
demands the amounts due.
' It li recommended to place on file the com
munication from the City and County Attor
ney, with his opinion that the City and
County is liable for the fees of Grand jurors
at the rate of ij>2 per day lor eacn aay's attend
ance, and for the fees of trial juiora at tho
same rate lor each day's attendance on the
Buperior Court when the court is engaged in
criminal cases,: whether the juror has been
actus ly impaneled or not: also that the City
and County is not liable for. the fees of jurors
in civil- cases except when a party litigant,
nor in criminal cases in the Police and Jus
tices' courts. -

these words of President Jordan, but I do
not wish to enter into a controversy with
him upon a general declaration like this,
made without any reference to myself or
my work; but it seems strange, doesn't it. .
that a member of the Congregational
church, which believes in revivals, and of
course in instantaneous . conversions,
Should make a declaration like that?
"I can readily believe, however, that
i Dr. Jordan made the statement you have
just read to me. When a man denies the
i validity of the atonement and sneers at
miracles as President Jordan has done,
we should not doubt the correctness of
any report which represents him as
promulgating agnostic ideas. He is
at tbe head of a great and pop
ular institution, and, as I said . be
fore, Ido not desire a controversy with
him. The patron of that school. Mrs.
Iceland Stanford, is warmly devoted to its
welfare, and she is a true friend of myself
and wife and has been for many years.
Sbe and Governor Stanford attended my
church in Washington for many years.
But regarding my views of revivals and of
instantaneous conversions, I say that I
firmly and steadfastly believe iri what j
is understood as revivals of religion j
in the evangelical church. I believe in a i
progressive and instantaneous conversion,
and so do thousands of the ablest men in
all parts of the civilized world men as
eminent in science and literature as in
religion. If President Jordan wishes to
question the sanity of many of the leading
jurists, historians, scholars and scientists
of all times and in all countriesâ that
is bis affair, but it is a weighty respon
sibility, it seem to me. '7 7 "
'According to my view the acceptance
of the Christian religion and the unfold
ment of the Christian life is eminently
the act of a sane mind. How can aeon
version to religion which contemplates the
betterment of the individual in every
walk of life be construed into insanity ?
To do good and be good is not insanity
surely. No, I cannot doubt for a moment
that the man with the noblest, best and
purest motives is likewise sane in the
highest and most exalted sense. Far from
agreeing with Dr. Jordan, l.want to re
mind him that the insanity of mankind
touching this question is portray ci by the
infidel and agnostic. The reformations of
Luther and Wesley mark eras in ; the
world's history, so attested by the ablest
historians the world has ever seen." â¢
Bishop Newman inclines to the opinion
that these expressions of agnosticism by
President Jordan are the direct result of
his training at Cornell University under
the guidance of President Andrew White.
The Bishop regards President White as
an agnostic â a kind of veiled unbeliever â
and Jordan is slowly and gradually pro
mulgating President White's peculiar ten
ets. The Bishop said that prior to Jor
dan's visit to Cornell he was apparently
devoted to the cause of the evangelical
church as practiced by the Congregational
church.

Damages for the Loss of a Hand.
The Supreme Court has bauded down a de
cision in the case of William H. Matthews
against John C. Bull Jr., in which tho former
is favored. Matthews was employed by Bull
in 1895 In the coirstntction of a jetty in Hum
boldt Bay. R.T.Stone, the superintendent,
placed Robert Astleford in charge of the pile-
river crew, of which Matthews was a member.
While Matthews was placing an iron ring on
the head of a pile the foreman ordered the
engineer to let go, and the hummer fell on
Matthews' hand, crippling him. for life. He
sued and got judgment for $1500. Bull ap

signed the following as his comment upon'
Professor Jordan's address:
"I do not Understand Dr. Jordan to
characterize all- revivals as religious dissi
pation and spiritual drunkenness. There
bave been enthusiasm, excesses and fanati
| cism which have masqueraded under the
garb of religion, but religion and genuine
revivals of religion are no more responsi
ble for these vagaries and follies than they
are for the ghost dances of the Piutes or
the orgies of Mrs. Woodworth's follower*.
"That tbere are weak and shallow souls
who, instead of buying their excitement
at the cigar-stand, the whisky saloon and
tbe opium joint, get it for nothing at the
camp-meeting, is doubtless true. But in a
ministry of twenty-five years I have been
in many revivals of religion which were
characterized by reformations in life and
transformations in character, and in none
of tbeise have I ever seen the scenes which
Dr. Jordan describes, where men and
women lose their reason and self-control.
"Macauiey, Green and other historians
agree that the Wesleyan movement' in
England, which was simply a widespread
revival of religion, exercised a . most
salutary influence upon private virtue
and public morality in England and saved
the state church from spiritual decay.
And I suppose that Dr. Joidan will ac
knowledge that the work â¢ which ' Mr.
Moody has been doing for the last twenty
years on two continentsâ a work which
has bean entirely unmarred by wildfire
and fanaticism has been a great and in
calculable blessing to the world.
"E. R. Dille, D. D."
The Rev. H. A. Ketch of the First
Presbyterian Church said that President
Jordan bad set np a man of straw and
knocked it over. //./.
"Religious excitement that amounts to
intoxication is not upheld by any one,"
said Dr. Ketchum. ;
"But certainly a proper degree of excite
ment is desirable, at least an awakening'
of Christian spirit, so that men may be d is
posed to appreciate- their own position
and the supreme importance of religious
matters. This is all the revivalism that
anyone ever advocates, and it never did
any harm on earth. .
. "Many of the greatest and most success
ful revivalists of history have conducted
their service-- without any undue excite
ment. There was an immense revival on
tue day of Pentecost, but there was no in
sanity or intoxication."
Tbe Christian ministers did not meet
yesterday, but in speaking of Dr. Jordan's
ideas on revival meetings Rev. "Dr. Francis
S. Ford of the First Christian Church of
this City said: Â-_.-. '-. r- â â 
"On the whole I think I agree with Dr.
Jordan. Revival meetings, that is,, the
sensational ones, you know, are a species
of moral drunkenness, and I think it im
possible for one to undergo such a com
plete change of character and thought in
the short space of an hour or so, and just the
same effects can- oe made on .the same
subjects by the simple use of a little hyp
notism. Why, I have actually known
people to go into trances and stay there
for hours, the results of a sensational re
vival meting, and think Dr. Jordan
knows whereof he speaks, and 1 must
sincerely agree with him."

Of Deviled Crabs Asks a Question.
Tbe following correspondence betwefin
Mr. McMenamin, the well-known producer
of hermetically sealed sea food, of Hamp-
ton, Va., and the Postum Cereal Co. may
interest some, as it touches a point upon-
which there have been some queries: "
"Hampton, Va.â Postum. Cereal Co.,
Battle Creek, Mich..â Gentlemen: Reply-
ing to your letter I beg to say that your
health coffee has a flavor, so far as I can
remember, of the best ceffoe, and this cof-
fee flavor was so pronounced that : I sus-
pected that coffee was mixed with the
other grains. I served it to some of my
guests without telling them what it was,
and they pronounced it very excellent
coffee. One of them was a coffee-drinker
who had to have it three tim s a day. I
would like to know if there is any coffee in
it. Very truly your?, James McMenamin."
"Battle Creek, Micb.â Mr. James Mc-
Menamin, Hampton. Va. â Dear Sir: We
have your esteemed' favor of the 28 h,' and
in reply to your inquiry as to the ingre-
dients will say that we are willing to stake
every penny that we can eet together that
Postum not only does not contain coffee,
but tbat it is composed strictly and en-
tirely of pure cereals of the field, the*
creater portion. being the various parts of
wheat. It look us nearly a year of experi-
menting to produce Po3tnm, the* health
coffee. It is an easy matter' to make a
weak sort of drink from browned rye;
wheat or malt, but to produce a liquid
from the cereals that has the color, taste
and nourishing properties of our present
product taxed our best energies and that
of one of the most expert analytical
chemists in America. â¢ .
. "We felt a desire to demonstrate the
principle that man's drink at meals should
be made from grains without any sort of
adulteration or chemical preparation aside
from simple cooking. It may be further,
explained that in order to produce Poatum
the cereals are cooked in different ways
and the final mixing of ths proper propor-
tions is what giv s us the desired result.
There is no possible argument that can
be brought forward .that will raise the
question for a moment regarding the fixed
lact of the healthful, nourishing and fat-
tening properties of the cereals furnished
by the all-wise Creator for man's natural
use. We thank you for your kind letter.
Yours respectfully, Postum Cereal Co..
Lira."
There is but one genuine original Postum
Cereal coffee, with a multitude of imita-
tions offered as "just as good." V';

The choir corps attached to this church
numbers '-at present time twenty-eight
.-. men and a similar'iiumber of boys, mak
ing fifty-six in- ail, who use the basement
or.. Sunday-school quarters of the church
as. their place of meeting.
... These quarters are too small for the
_j athletic exercise which the boys would
"like., to enjoy if they had sufficient room
â¢in which' to rig up. their paraphernalia. In
order to. provide them with suitable quar
ters not only for cymnasium sports, but ;
also billiards and tennis grounds, together \
with mental- culture, there will be elegant j
library and reading rooms provided for j
. the .use of the men and boys belonging to :

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY '2,.' 1897.
DELAY FOR THE
GEARY FRANCHISE
The Supervisors Rescind
All Action Previously
Taken. .
Â»
All Bids and Offers Are to Be
Sent Back to Those Who
Made Them.
The Board Also Declares Against the
Use of Folsom Stone Upon the
City Streets.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday re
scinded everything that was done by toe
old board relative to the award of the
franchise to the Geary-street, Park and
Ocean Railroad Company, and in a resolu
tion it was agreed "that all bids and
offers for said franchise be returned to
the persons to whom they respectively
belong."
â¢ The mover of the preamble and resolu
tion was Supervisor Rottanzi. Ti.ere was
no opposition when tbe roll was called.
The text upon which this action was taken
is as follows: _. â 
Whereas, There is now pending and unde
termined before this board the matter of the
application of the Geary -street, Park and
Ocean Railroad Company for a tranchise lor
the right to construct and maintain and
operate, for the term of fifty years, a single or
double line of street railroad upon certain
streets in the City and County ot San Fran
cisco, to wit: Commencing at the Intersection
of Geary street with MarKet, and running
thence along and upon Geary street to junc
tion with Point Lobos avenue; thence along
and upon Point Lobos avenue to Fifth avenue;
thence along and upon Fifth avenue to Golden
Gate Park; and whereas the award of said
franchise has been interdicted by an order of
the Superior Court in and for the City and
County ot San Francisco; and whereas, it is
the sense and policy of this Board of Super
visors that no tranchise or privilege shall be
awarded to renew either directly or indirectly
any existing franchise or privilege until the
lapse or expiration of such iranchise or privi
lege, for the reason that the otter of any fran
chise before its expiration is destructive of
fair, open and public competition, and that
the sale thereof would produce a revenue to
this municipality greatly disproportionate to
its value: now, therefore, be lt -* â¢ -
Resolved, That this board take no further
action toward the award of the franchise ap
plied for as aforesaid; that the resolution of
the Board of Supervisors ol this City and
County, passed aud adopted on the _*9th day
oi June, 189ti, aud numbered 14649_1_. (third
series), providing for the submission to public
competition of said franchise, and all pro
ceedings taken by the Board ol Supervisors of
this City and County in pursuance of said
resolution, be and they are hereby rescinded
and repealed, and that all bids and otter* for
said franchise be returned to the persons to
whom they respectively belong.
Supervisor Rottanzi spoke briefly, de
scribing what had already been done. He
believed that to award the franchise before
the oil franchise has expired would be
unconstitutional. -. ',.,''â /
Another matter of general interest came
up. This was the following resolution, the
adoption of which was moved by Super
visor Britt:
Resolved by the Honorable Board of Supervisor*
of the City and County of Han Francisco, That we
respecttully remonstrate against tne passage
of any law which brings convict labor into
competition with free white lebor. Wo re
spectfully remonstrate against the passage of
any measure providing ior tbe crushing of
rock at Folsom prison to be used for street or
concreting purposes within any town or city
of the state. We object to this because there
are ii large number ol our fellow-citizens now
engaged in quarrying stone and preparing it
for macadamizing and concreting purposes in
the various cities 01 tnis State, and thus sup
port their families, and such labor cannot
compete with convict labor in that line. ' We
do not object to the sale of rock by the State
for county road purposes.. :r; -..
This resolution was adopted, Supervisor
Britt urging immediate action to affect
legislation which may be had at Sacra
mento soon in reference to this matter.
The customary resolution that the
board should meet as a committee ol the
whole to consider the fixing of water
rates was adopted upon motion of Super
visor Delaney. Supervisor Clinton also
gave notice that the Water Committee
would meet Wednesday afternoon in ref
erence to water rates. Dr. Clinton said
that i lie Water Committee would not in
terfere wiih the action of the board as a
committee of the whole.
The Committee on Licenses and Orders
reported in favor of reducing the licenses
on cycleries, to place upon them the same
figures as now apply to livery stables.
Among minor matters considered were
the following:
Stephen J. Whelan and many others pc- I
titioned for the passage of an order to prohibit '
the opening of the i- ourth-street bridge be- J
tween '5:30 and 7:30 a. m. and between 5:30 |
and 0:30 P. M-, and to require vessels passing j
through the channel to be moved by steam
power, and also asking for repairs to the I
bridge sufficient to enable it to make a Com
plete revolution.
The Sunset Improvement Club requested
the board to take action to control the over
flow to Lake Honda,- sewerage of the Alms
house, etc., on J street. The same Club also
atked that all proceedings In contemplated
street work in streets and avenues south of j
Golden Gate Park may be stopped, excepting
on seven avenue, until a system of sewerage
is provided.
Nathan Crocker asked that an early date be
set for the hearing of the petition ot the asso
ciated improvement clubs for the abolishment
of the rattler test.
The protest ot the California State Labor
Convention against allowing inmates of the
Almshouse and City and County Hospital to
work lr. and about these institutions without
regular compensation as fixed by the trades
unions was received.
The Caliiornia Acetylene Gas ' Company
asked permission to place generators iv the
Crocker building.
The Manhattan Athletic Association was
voted a free license for a boxing tournament.
, Justice 01 the Peace Kerrigan was given per
mission to leave the State for thirty days. It
was voted to leave street lamps uniighud six
days each month about the time ol the lull
moon. ' : . >:
Resolutions were adopted inviting proposals
for a franchise tor a street railroad on Masonic
avenue from Oik street to Page and on Clay
ton from Frederick to Carl.

PENAL STRIPES FOR
ARTHUR JACKSON
August Florentine's Slayer
Convicted of Man
slaughter.
Prisoner's Sister Fainted When
. the Fateful Words Were
â  Uttered.
Sorrowful Scene in Juige Wallace's
Court Upon the Rendering of
tbe Jury's Verdict.
: il ' : --; :|;,
There was a painful scene in Judge "Wal
lace's court yesterday, when Arthur Jack
son, 19 years old, was declared guilty of
manslaughter, for the killing of August
Florentine on the 10th of last August, near
the intersection of Fifteenth avenue and
San Bruno road, in this City.
Jackson made a stubborn defense and
Attorney T. V. Eddy exhausted every legal
expedient to clear his client. At a former
trial in Judge Belcher's court, the jury
had failed to agree. When the jury re
tired for deliberation yesterday morning,
the defendant and his counsel expressed
hopes of a speedy acquittal. After the
jury had been out for a couple of hours,
Jackson's friends arrived at the conclusion
that there was to be another disagreement.
The young man's father and mother
were present, as were also his three sis
ters, and they were bracing themselves by
strong resolve to withstand the strain and
latigureof another. trial,- which they feared
was imminent, when the warning bell
from tire jury-room gave notice that the
jury had reached a verdict. >
* At once the twelve good men and true
were escorted into court by Bailiff Curtis,
and without formality Clerk Salomon
read the verdict which consigns Arthur
Jpckson to stripes and a felon's cell.'
Immediately wild shrieks filled the
chamber of justice, and Miss Lena Jack
son, one of the sisters of the prisoner, fell
in a swoon, while ncr mother and her
other sisters burst forth into hysterical
sobbing. The prisoner's father, his face
seamed with manly tears, sought to com
fort his dear ones, while overpowering
grief at the law's sentence seemed to
crush him.
Judge Wallace quickly withdrew, as did
also Deputy District Attorney Black, who
had conducted the prosecution. The curi
ous onlookers were evicted by the officers
of the court and the members of that dis
tracted family were left alone with their
sorrow. It was an hour before the ladies
were able to be removed to their homes.
Jackson pleaded self-defense, but this
was discredited by the jury. The killing
took place in Florentine's saloon. Jack
j son entered the place with two com
panions and they conducted themselves in
such a disorderly manner that Florentine
ordered them from the premises and was
I shot by Jackson. The testimony for the
| defense was that the deceased snapped
a pistol at Jackson and was shot before he
I could do so again.
Judge Wallace's instructions to the jury
were of unusual lencth atjil his analysis
I of the law of the crime of murder was
j elaborate. "The law," he said, "is tender
| of human life and will not sanction its
I taking wantonly or without reason there
; for. In order to make it self-defense it
j must appear that Jackson, when he fired
i the shot, had, or thought he had, or, as a
{ reasonable man, had grounds to think that
he had, no reliable means of escape from
j the then present personal peril other than
I the means afforded him by the shooting
iof Florentine. In order to excuse murder
; on the ground of self-defense the slayer
| must use all. the effective means he knows
i tp be in his power to secure his per
sonal safety. If he knows that retreat is
| practicable and will afford him such safety
\ he must retreat."
| The court lurther stated that when
| Florentine ordered Jackson and his com
j panions to depart it was their duty to
obey, and the fact that he resorted to
menace did not absolve them from their
duty to depart Unless his conduct was
such that they could not with safety de
part or retreat from the saloon, in whicn
case they would have the right to defend
themseives against the assault.
Some of Jackson's friends expressed dis
! satisfaction. They thought that the ver
dict of manslaughter must .have been
reached as the result of a compromise. If
a verdict of murder had been given they
would have regarded the chances for re
versal in the Supreme Court more favor-
I able.
The|xlreme penalty for the. crime of
manslfuehter is ten years in the State
prisori and with good conduct this may
De reduced to less than seven years. Â»
Two Chinese Oeported.
Two Chinese were ordered deported by
United Stales Commissioner ileacock yester
day for being illegally in the country. One
was La Chung Cnuey, a notorious highbinder,
who h> s just finished serving a term at Folsom
for burglary, and tne other a Chinese cook-on
tin- American ship \V_ F. Babcock. He showed
that he nad been sailing <o American ports for
several years past, but admitted that he was
in Hong-Kong when registration was going on
here., The testimony left the Commissioner
no alternative but to send him back.

CHICAGO MABKETS.
CHICAGO, 11.1., Feb. 1. â Demoralization
reigned supreme in the wheat market at the open
ing to-day. Every item of information seemed to
be against prices, and first trading was from 11A.
to I : '4C under Saturday* closing. Liverpool
cables quoted dec ines varying trom % 10 V__d:
stocks of wheat In warehouses at thai place :or
the month o 'January showed an increase of
872,000 bushels. Tlie amount of w_i eat on ocean
passage Increased 160,000 despite recent compara
tively light snlpments from all <â  ountries. The
world's shipments were estimated at 4.900,000
bushels to 1,560,103 bushels, but later were offi
cially given at 4,083.000 bushels. Everything
was ronstrued as distinctly favorable to a lower
range of values and orle ings of wheat were there
fore heavy.
The Northwest received 421 cars, against 185
last Monday an i 634 a year ago, another fact
which was inimi al to improvement. Chicago re
ceived 30 cars and inspected ou: 131,649 bushels.
The weakness comlnu-d in control hrounhout.
but, after toe posting of the visible supply figures
sho* In* a decrease of 1,704,000 bushels, there
was a slight improvement in the tone. Export
I clearances weie large at 643,734 bushels. Paris
. cables were unchanged to h.gber, Antwerp un
changed and Berlin lower. Ibe English visible
supply decreased 320 000 bushels. May wheat
opened from 7-U,_c. to 736 B e. sold betwe-n 73"-.gc

82a/gC to Mi _c. closing at 83i.i!a"J4*.4<:.
CoKX â Alter concurring in th* weakness of
wheat at the opening corn soon after displayed a
better tone. Receipts, 484 cars, were 36 less than
estimated and 174,244 bushels were withdrawn
from store. The uemand ior corn was generally
good, an impression prevailing tha: prices of this
grain must approach nearer to those cf wheat.
Liverpool wheat was *^d lower. Ilia amount on
ocean passage decreased 1.5.0. C00. The visible
supply Increased 220.1 bushels. Export clear
ances were large a. 740,795 bushels. May corn

i with wheat, but subsequently exhibited an inclina
-1 tion to improve under the li fltienc- extenaed by
corn. Receipts were '2h2 cars and 81,031 bushels
were withdrawn irom store. The visible supply
increased 19.000 bushels. May oats closed un

Discretion the Better Part of Valor.
On a recent foggy night In Dublin an
elderly -rentleman rushed up t oa police
man and exclaimed excitedly:
"Policeman, there- are half a dozen
roughs jumping on a gentleman round the
corner. Hadn't you better go?"
"Divil a Dit. One man's enough for the
blaguards to jump on at a time.'' And
the man in blue continued his leisurely
inspection of the doors and shutters in an
opposite direction from the scene of strife

CALIFORNIA CHESTNUTS.
Great Possibilities for the Successful
Growth of the Nut in California.
â¢BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. I.â lnspector
Charles H. Si-inn of the Agricultural Ex-
periment Stations of the State University,
who has .just returned from an extended
lrip through the northern counties of the
State, brought with him a quantity of
Italian chestnuts growu on the uplands of.
Amador County.
The nuts are large, fleshy and as sweet
and rich as- the averaee nut grown on
Italian soli. He believes that there are
great possibilities for the successful de
velopment of the chestnut industry in
California, since the soil and climate in
certain portions of the State are admira
bly adapted for their growth, and since
the demand for the nut is becoming
greater and greater each year.
"These which I have brought with me,"
said he, ''were grown at Middle Fork,
Amador County, about six miles from
Jackson, at an altitude of 18,000 feet. The
trees from which they came were planted
in deep red soil, and were several years
old.
"This particular section in which they
grew seemed' to be the natural home
the' chestnut, because the trees are seed
lings and sprang up of their own accord
from nuts thrown out by an Italian
rancher.
"The nuts are as good as any I have
evpj seen and I anticipate a boom for
chestnuts in the Staie if the proper lo
calities ar** chosen for their growth.
Fruitgrowers will do well to look into the
possibilities for the nut in California at
least. -â¢*
NOMINATED FOR A JOKE.
But Now Martin Egan Has to
Facs a Very Serious
Complication.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,!
_BgJÂ£9-'S Broadway, Feb. 1. ,
Martin Egan, the Democratic nominee
for Library Trustee, is the most uneasy
man in town. He is looking around for
the author of a joke that was perpetrated
on him at the convention last Tuesday
night, and when he finds him there will
certainly De trouble.
Mr. Egan is one of the most popular
young men on Broadway and has made
quite a reputation by writing for the
newspapers. He was at the Democratic
Martin Egan, Who Was Nomi
nated for Library Trustee as a
Joke.
convention the other night, and to his
great surprise he heard himself nomi
nated' by acclamation for Library Trustee.
The gentleman who placed his name in
nomination was Judge Hiram Luttrelland
in his speech he paid a high compliment
to the nominee. Not until the chairman
announced the name of the choice of the
convention did Mr. Egan fully under
stand what was going on. He then at
tempted to matte a little explanation to
the chairman, but all that could be heard
was the word "joke." ,
"There is nothing jocular about this
convention," said Chairman Coocan;. "we
are here on serious business," and before
Euan could recover the secretary had cast
the ballot of the convention for Library
Trustees. __y*_P
. Egan demanded an explanation from
Lnttrell and the Judge stated that one of
his friends had been to him and told him
i that Mr. Egan was very desirous of the
nomination and was particularly anxious
that Mr. Luttteil should place his name
before the convention. Bean at once de
manded to know the name of the friend,
but the Jud-e scenting trouble refused to
divulge it. Since that nie-.ht various dele
gations from the Ponkinkey Club, tne
Courthouse, the City Hall and other places
where officials gather have called on Mr.
Egan. and tried to induce him to stay in
the li-L'h . As a -matter of fact, Egan is an
active member of the Republican Alliance
of Oakland and a stanch McKinley man,
and he is at a loss to reconcile himsell'to
seeing his name on tbe Democratic ticket.
Another peculiarity of. the recent con
vention occurs in the case of George F.
Hatton, who was nominated Thursday
evening last for School Director. Deputy
City -Clerk Holland was working to-day
trying to discover if Mr. Hatton fulfilled
the requirements of the iaw. It is dis
tinctly stated in the statutes that a School
Director must be the head of a household,
and although Mr. Holland knows person
ally that Mr. Hatton is a confirmed old
.bachelor he says he is not at lioeriy to use
his personal knowledge to the extent of
taking -Mr. Hatton's name off, the tax
payers' ticket. * When Mr. Hatton returns
from, Sacramento it will be necessary for
him to make an affidavit regarding his
qualifications to serve as School Director.

Attempts to Crimin

Stormy Meeting of the Presby
tery, Resulting in a Pas

S quel to tbe Strained Relations
B.tween the Doctor and His
Church
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. l. J"
The Oakland Presbytery met in the Cen
tennial Presbyterian Church to-night with
eighteen members present and a very
large attendance of lay members of the lo
cal organization. The call was for the
consideration of the report of a special
committee appointed at BerKeley last De
cember on the relation of Rev. Dr. Ellis
and the church.
Dr. Ellis read the following sensational
charges against some of the deacons of
his church:
T.i the Presbytery of Oakland, Fathers and
Brtthi aiâ Greeting: In behalf of tne session
and iii ihe interest of Centennial Presbyterian-
Church I herewitn transmit to you tacts
which call for your serious consideration.
As a session we are powerless to d.scnarge
the duty incumbent up*n us under the law of
the church, and our effort to discbarge our
duty is without effect, and for cause to wit:
A want of harmony and co-operation among
the ruling elders of the session, as will appear
irom the low lug tacts:
On the evening of January 6, 1897, the ses
sion convened to try to secure peace and recon
ciliation in the church, to which meeting
three of the young people were invited. The
young people were present, and with
them some of their friends. The meet
ing became & scene of confusion on account of
want of harmony and unity among the ruling
elders. The chief cause of excitement and
confusion being the conduct of Eider G. S.
I'rosser and Elder H. S. Hastings. The former
by word ana spirit sought to criminate the
moderator, the pastor-elect of the church, and
the latter sought to criminate both pastor-elect
and the presbytery.
Referring to the action of the presbytery of
December 10, 1890, Elder H. S. Hastings de
nounced the report of the presbytery bearing
upon the interests of the Centennial churcn
as "a weight over our heads," "a ring in our
nose," "a gag In our mouths " The result was
tnat the young people were defiant of the ses" ;
siou and dec. ard their intention to so remain*
and arc dome so at the present time.
These facts 1 relate for the information of
the presbytery, praying for such direction as
the wisdom ycur worthy body may afford as I
to now to proceed in the discharge ot duty and |
fur the we. tare of the church committed to my !
pastoral care, and for such relief as to your
judgment seems best. lam sincereir,
John \V. Ellis.
The report of the special committee I
made no recommendation, but asked the
Presbytery to decide for itself. The De- I
cember meetinir decided that the relation
existing be allowed to stand until the
spring meeting, in April. Dr. Ellis has
held the call for eighteen months without
installation, and refused to surrender or
ask for installation.
To-night the Presbytery reconsidered its
; action at Berkeley, and then the trouble
j began.
E der Prosser then stated that a large
number of the members did not want Dr.
Ellis installed, and then read a petition ol
two deacons, all of the elders and a ma
jority of the trustees, besides ninety mem
bers, asking that the call extended eigh
teen months ago be returned to the con
gregation.
Elder Warren thought the request reas
onable and should be granted. If tue
doctor wanted to be might keep the call
four years and then not accept.
This brought Dr. El. is to his feet with
the charge--. A motion to request the re- j
turn of the cali to the Presbytery by Dr.
Ellis was voted down after a lengthy and |
heated discussion and the motion to give !
the doctor until the spring meeting to ac- ;
cept or reject the same was defeated.
This put the presbytery in a peculiar j
position and caused a lengthy debate as !
to their exact position. Moderator Brush
of Alameda stales that Dr. Ellis must i
either accept or reject the call at once as ,
the presbytery refused to grant him any
further time.
Dr. Ellis then asked that it be referred i
to the congregation for a vote, staling
that he would know what to do in that I
way. He stated positively time and again '
that he did not want nor would be in- j
stalled. He accepted the call with the !â 
understanding that he would have until
April to complete his work, when he would I
leave. â  -y-i-J
Before the vote was taken and after Dr.
Ellis' char-res against the members of the
church had been read the moderator j
stated that "No one can be biased by
promiscuous charges made without proof
at thn stage of the meeting."
Mr. Prosser then asked the chair what
relation existed between the church and
Dr. Ellis, but no one could answer him.
It was suggested that the congregation
hold a meeting Wednesday night next to
consider the matter. When the meeting
adjourned at 12 o'clock it was with the I
understanding that they meet at the call
of the moderator.
In the meantime the relations of the
pastor, the congregation and the presby
tery to each other are Indefinite, but as
an elder expressed if, "We just know
enough to keep us quarreling."
Mr. Hastings called on Dr. Ellis just be
fore the anjournment and notified him
that he wouid be held strictly to account
if he gave the charges to the press.
Dr. Ellis simply replied, "I am ready to
swear to them."
Boh gentlemen are well-known Chris
tian men of standing, and they replied
that they had the entire confidence of the
congregation, and that no such charge
will ever be proved against them.
AN UNHAPPY BRIDE.
Committed to an Insane Asylum
Five Days Alter Her
Marriage.
She Lo>t Reason Because ot Religious
Excitement and Became Very
Violent.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. I.â Five days
ago O.lie May Miller, a young lady of
Williams, Colusa County, married Wil
liam Rourke at Sacramento. The young
couple camo to Oakland last Thursday to
stay a lew days with W. A. Young on
Ninth street, West Oakland. The day
after their arrival Mrs. Rourke became
hysterical and gave way to a religious
mania until she became violent. Her
condition became so serious that a physi
cian was called in and the had to be re
strained.
At times the young bride tried to bite
people and would not , take any food,
thinking that people were trying to
poison her. She threatened to cut out
she heart of her at endant. and her condi
tion became so bad that it was necessary
to have her examined by tho Lunacy
Commissioners, and to-day she was com
mitted to the asylum. She is but 22 years
of age. As. she sat in the courtroom be
side her young husband, she appeared to
be a very attractive young woman,- and
the doctors give great hope that she will
soon be restored to her reason. The bride
was a Protestant and her husband a
Catholic, and the Tuesday ni;ht before
she was married she consented to be bap
tized into the Catholic church. Her hus
band is a young farmer residing near
Colusa.
That Street Contract.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. I.â The City
Council met to-night to consider the alter
ing of a bid for street work after the con
tract had been le'. The contract read
"4000 feet of curbing at 8 9-10 cents," and
followed other bids for the same street at
so much per foot. The curbing item was
followed by no ditto marks and conse
quently the whole contract was let for
8 9-10 cents. Some time later it was
discovered that the ditto marks had been
inserted, and the Council inspected the
bid to-night with magnifying glasses and
agreed that the marKs had been inserted
after the contract had been awarded, and
tbat the amount to be paid for the work
was but a total of 8 9-10 cents, and the
Street Superintendent was ordered to
make out the assessment accordingly.
Gray Bros, were the contractors.
Cohen In More Trouble.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 1.-A dispatch
from T com a published in to-day's papers
about Meyer Cohen, who is under arrest at
Tacoma on a charge ol embezzlement, re
calls the circumstances under which Cohen
left Oakland. About a year ago De had
arraneed to wed Miss Greenberg of Salt
Jose, but at the hour set for the wedding
Cohen did not appear, and it was found
that he had gone north to avoid some ex
planation regarding the signing of certain
checks. His prospective father-in-law
swore out a warrant for Cohen's arrest, ant
it would have Deen served had not Cohen
threatened to have Greenberg arrested for
opening a stamped letter which came to
Green berg's house. The case was dropped.
Now Cohen is in jail again.
IN SECRET SESSION.
The Municipal League Has

W. R. Thomas Nimmated for Mayor,

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 1. \
The Municipal League commenced its
convention to-night at Masonic Temple.
The proceedings are all secret and not
even a list of delegates has been mad.
public.
Much less interest was manifested In the
proceedings than in former years, as the
main strength of the league allied with the
I regular Republicans at their party conven
| tion two weeks a.o.
The work of nomination went alone
very smoothly till the Councilmen were
I reached. W. R. Thomas was indorsed for
1 Mayor, W. A. Dow for City Attorney, A.
EL Wilson for City Engineer, R. W. Snow
I for Auditor, and Z. T. Gilpin for Tax Col
lector.
Much wrangling ensued over the nomi
nations for Councilmen and several names
not on any ticket were put forward. â¢ It
was finally decided that notning more
should be done till the Republicans Dad
completed their ticket. The indorsement
of the league is not considered by candi
dates to be of much value, while a few
have expressed a desire not to be in
dorsed. The secrecy Observed by the
league two years ago destroyed to a great
extent public confidence and led to the
defeat of J. W. Kelson, its candidate for
Mayor.
GENUINE DEATH-TRAP.
An Alkali Hill on the County- Koad
Slides Into a Canyon Near
Livermore.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Feb. 1. â The con*
tractors who are' repairing the county
highway in Dooling Canyon have dis
covered a bill about 200 feet in height that
is gradually sliding away. This peculiar
moving mass of earth is on Thomas
Croach's land, about three miles west of
Livermore. The county road runs along
tbe eastern slope of the hill, and just
below the road at the bottom of the canyon
is a small running creek. For several
years past the land has taken periodical
slides. In July last an underground cut
was made that carried thousands of tons
of an alkali formation toward the little
creek. Since then it has climbed up the
hill and drawn down the road at a point
that has made passage lor teams almost
impossible.
On Tuesday last Roadmaster McCioud
visited the scene and witnessed the im
mense underground flow of earth that is
settled at the bottom of the canyon. The
formation is of a grayish color and seem
ingly of a solid nature, but it is said to be
a veritable deathtrap, lt is the alkali cov
ering that gives it the terra firma appear
ance, and should any one attempt to cross
any one of a number of such places he
would sink to a depth of twenty feet or
more.
The cause of the slide is attributed to a
soring or a number or spring- tnat have a
perpetual flow which gravity has given an
outlet underneath the road. It will only
be a matter of time until the whole hill
slides into tho canyon.
The contractors have a force of men at
work at the scene piling and bridging. A
bridge sixteen feet wide and forty-five feet
long is in course of construction and is,
being put up at an elevation that will per
mit the sliding earth to pass underneath,
and unless it moves in larger bodies than
heretofore it will not harm the bridge.
Merritt Boys May Lose.
OAKLAND. Cal , Feb. I.â A defect has
been discovered in the appeal of Harry
and Janies Merritt from the decision of
Judge Hawley of the United States Circuit
Court which sustained the bequest of the
late Dr. Merritt to Bowdoin College and
also for a hospital in Oakland.
List Saturday the Merritt boys applied
to Judge McKenna for a certificate show
ing that the question of jurisdiction is in
volved, and how it arose, which certificate
must be riled at the same time that the
decision is entered. This was not done by
the Merritt boys, and as the Supreme Court
of the United States has repeatedly decided
that the certificates must be granted at the
same time that the decision is entered, it
is said by counsel that it will undoubtedly
follow the precedent and will dismiss the
appeal and finally wind up the whole
business and permit tho distribution of
the bequests.

FOUR FAVORITES
EARNED BRACKETS
The Talent Enjoyed a
Profitable Day at
Ingleside.
Cash Sloan Landed King William
an Easy Winner at OJds
of .7 to i.
Free Lady Captured the Two-Year-
Oid Dishâ nam- a Was First
" With Sloan Up.
The week's racing opened very auspi
ciously for the favorites at Ingleside yes
terday, four -backed first choices
being returned winners. Twenty-two
bookmakers laid odds, and in the- hustle
and bustle for business good prices were
obtainable against, the different winners.
The various events were shaded with
selling platers and the attendance was
not quite up to the average.
Tod Sloan, the autocrat of the saddle,
made visitations to the wire on three sep
arate occasions on the leading horse, and
his brother Cash landed King William a
winner in comely fashion at remunerative
odds.
The first event decided was a six- furlong
selling sprint, with ten lining up at the
barrier. The â¢ Spreckels entry Wyoming,
the 9 to 5 favorite, proven a very handy
winner, heading out the 20 to 1 outsider
Two Cheers with something in reserve.
Babe Murphy, clumsily ridden by T. Mc-
Hugh, was a good third.
W. P. Magrane's two-year-old filly,
Free Lady, starting an 11 to 10 favorite,
experienced no difficulty whatever in
annexing the kindergarten event for her
owner. Away second she soon took the
lead and won very easily from Outlay,
reeling off the three furlongs in 38> a sec
onds. Bodacia finished in the show.
Tips on starters in the five-furlong
scramble that was next in order were more
prevalent than freckles on a ginger
topped country schoolboy. Zoolein, Red
Bird, Billy Ayers and one or two others,
according to their respective constituents,
held first mortgages on the parse. When
it came to the showdown Isabelle, the 3}^
to 1 second choice, piloted by Thorpe,
downed Z jolein a head in 1 :06. Red Bird',
the favorite, was well up in front to the
stretch, where he weakened, and was not
in the money at the end.
Collins and McLight were scratched
from the mile and a sixteenth run, leav
ing but lour to face the issue. â¢ Pat Dunne's
brown colt Beiiamela, with Sloan in the
saddle, was backed down from 11 to 10 to
7 to 10, and waiting on Judge Denny to

won cleverly from Murie Fonse, th - sec

tin was evidently outclassed, bearing the
target throughout.
Among the len starters in the fifth
event, a five-furlong dash, was King Wil
liam, a full brother to the great Kingston,
the latter now retired to stud duty. He
races in the name of Frank Brown, and
the stable money apparently did not go in
on him to any great extent, 6 and 7 to 1
always being obtainable against him.
Away from the post eighth, he ran around
his field at the turn, and galloped in the
easiest sort of a winner over Brametta, a
20 to 1 outsider in the betting. White
stone, the lukewarm choice, came fast at
the end, finishing third. .
T. Sloan was in evidence again astride
the back of Estaca, the 6 to 5 favorite in
the last race, a seven-furlong purse affair.
The c it made all the running and not
extended during any part of the journey
led George Palmer out at the wire by two
lengths in 1:32*4. Lincoln 11, well backed
to win, secured show honors.

TYPHOID IS PREVALENT.
; â
Numerous Cases of the Disease
Reported by Berkeley
- Physicians.
It Is Reported That a Numb.r of
Them Were Caused by Im
pure Milk.
BERKELEY, Oal., Feb. I.â Typhoid
fever, which is now prevalent in Berkeley,
has been the cause of much alarm on the
part of the friends of the afflicted ones.
The apparent cause of two cases has been
traced to typhoid bacilli in the milk used
by the patients. A little daughter of one"
of the university professors was stricken
down a few days ago and the attending
physician, npon examination of the milk *.
used, stated that disease germs were to be
found in it. * He is now making a scientific â 
test of the milk in: question so as to be
certain of his ground "before condemning
the dairy from which it was received.
Health Officer Rowell is making a
round of investigation into the causes of
the epidemic. .;- ' - . -â¢ .
About twenty 1 cases of the fever have
been reported within the last two weeks.
Students Arrested.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. Lâ Dispatches
from Harvard University announce the
arrest of two California students for using
nrearms in the city limits. They are
Stanley Hollister of Santa Barbara and
Charles Bull of Belmont. Both were
fined $15. _
Youn_t Hollister is well known in Berke
ley, having been a student some years ago
in Botis' Gymnasium. He was prominent
in social and athletic circles and after
graduation left for Harvard. The trou-
Dies in which the young man became in
volved grew out of a student celebration
which took nlace last Tuesday night. At
midnight a large number of firearms were
discharged in celebration of the end of the
midyear examinations. Before the affair
was over one of the new college buildings
was literally riddled with bullet holes and
a residence opposite was also perforated.
Twenty-five warrants were issued lot the
arrest of the students having a band in the
affair, with the result that Hollister and
Bull were among the first to be taken by
the police.
. >o Basket-Bail.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. I.â The proba
bility is that there will be no intercolle- â¢
giate basket-ball game this season, as the
one last year seems to have evoked too
much publicity for the Berkeley co-eds.
The Stanford team seems willing to have
another game, and, in fact, a communica
tion has been received from the Palo
Alto girls seeking a second contest. The
U. C. co-eds will train, however, for games
among themselves and with the teams
from the seminaries about the bay, but
they declare another intercollegiate match
to be cut of the question.
William Coward Improving.. "
BERKELEY. Cal., Feb. I.â William M. "
Coward, the BerKeley member of the
funding bill committee of fifty, who was
reported to have gone insane as a result â 
of overwork in his attempt to defeat the
bill, is improving. Reports from Stock
ton state that he is less violent, and
| that he takes lood readily. It is expected
| that he will be able to be removed before
a great while.

MASK AND
BLUDGEON
Two Robbers Enter the
Home of Rodger
O'Connor.
THEIR FEATURES WERE
CONCEALED.
The Old Man Brutally Beaten
and Left Almost Un
. conscious.
THEY WERE IN QUEST OF
MONEY.
Mat O'Connor, the Victim's Nephew,
Saw Them, but Cannot Iden
tify Them-
Rodger O'Connor, an aged man of 70
years living in a liit'e cottage at 508 St.
Hose's avenue, was assaulted and brutally
beaten by two black-masked robbers at
12:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon.
The vicious criminals were in quest of
money when they entered the old man's
house. O'Connor was in the bacK of his
cottage when the robbers rushed in
the front door, and before he could
realize his position he received a blow
that left a large gaping wound on his face,
and which extended from his left eye to
the lower jaw.
He reeled back, half stunned, but man
aged to retain his senses and shont loudly
for help. A second blow from the robber
laid his right cheek open almost to the
bone and he fall unconscious on the floor.
Tbe victim's cries for help were heard
by his nephew, Mat O'Connor, who was
strolling along the avenue a short dis
tance away.
He hurried to his uncle's house, but the
sound of his footsteps on the pavement
reached the ears of the criminals, and
they rushed into the street.
Tbey prised within a short distance of
Mat O'Connor, and although they tote off
their masks on reaching the street he
failed to get a good view of their faces.
O'Connor's assailants sped along St.
Rose's avenue for a couple of blocks and
then turned south into the hills and dis
appeared. They evidently knew that the
district they were operating in was
afforded but little police protection.
â¢Mrs. Elizabeth O'Connor, sister of the
.red man, who occupies a cottage at
510 St. Rose's avenue, was notified shortly
after the assault that her brother had been
severely dealt with by two unknown rob
bers. She hurried to Point Lobos avenue
and reported the case to Policeman H. J.
Pyie.
The policeman returned with Mrs.
O'Connor to the house and then set aboat
" locating the offenders.
â¢ .He was unsuccessful, however, and last
evening the assault and attempted rob
bery was reported at police headquarters.
Detectives will be detailed on tbe case,
but it is. hardly probable that the men
will ever be captured.
Mat O'Connor, who procured the best
view of the robbers, describes them as
short, stout men, probably about 5 feet 5
or 6 inches in height. Both wore light
clothes and felt hats.
In the excitement of the moment he
failed to impress as comolete a description
of the men as he desired,
Maclin E. O'Connor, a brother of the
criminals' victim, who resides at 506 St.
Rose's avenue, is confident that robbery
was the motive that prompted the assault
on his brother.
He said last night that his brother
drew about $200 from a local bank a few
weeks ago, and somehow or other the lact
became known around the vicinity.
He is of the opinion that his brother's
assailants heard that he had the money
in the house and determined to get it,
even if murder had to be committed.
Martin E. O'Connor's honse was entered
by bur. lars about a week ago aud thor
oughly ransacked.
He believes that the parties who are
guilty of yesterday's crime committed the
one a week ago. He suspects certain
parties of the crimes and will report his
suspicions to the.police.

By a clause in the specifications read in pur
suance of section 3-45 of the Political Code,
the contract will contain a stipulation that
einht hours shall constitute a day's labor on
all work done thereunder. ... _
All architects or contractors are governed
on making estimates for work on the rate of
wages paid in the community in which the
work is to be done, and the contractors of this
State figure to pay the rate of wages that have
been paid in this Slate for the past seven years,
viz.: Four dollars for eight hours labor.

Examiner of the 24tn inst., which reads:
Wantedâ Four flrut-clais stone-cutters. Apply

Four first-class' stonecutters, residents of
this City, applied for work and were informed
that they could have work at the rate cf $3 lor
ten hours. .-'â¢'.....: Bf__!___E
We contend that it Is a gross injustice to re
duce wages and increase the hours of labor on
State work. It-is not the Junction of Stale
to reduce its citizens to the lowest possible
living plane, and -it is our opinion that this
contract was not awarded with such an end in
view, but in good iaiih that its citizens would
get fair play. We ask no favors, but we do ask
for the enforcement of the eight-hour law.
and request the executive officers to see that
its citizens get as fair a deal on Slate work as
we get in the field of competition on the out
side. \
A preference was given on the stone to be
used on the building (a product of this State)
of between $ 7000 and $8000 over and above
the stone from Oregon. The only just reason
ior such a course ii to loster home industries
and develop the resources of our Stale and
thus help its citizens.
The contractors of the City end State are not
being fairly treated if such a course Is allowed
to continue. What is the use of Inserting a
clause in any contract if it has no meaning '.'
Contractors are mislead, and the* only thing
accomplished is to give an advantage to tin

STORY OF THE
BARRY BLANKS
They Were Printed Simply
to Test the Skill cf
Experts.
Lees Fails to Interject the In
cident Into the Cooney
â  Case.
Magistrate Crok Will Compare the
Pencil-Deeds Certificates With the
Crocker Proofs To-Day.
Legal cobwebs were brushed aside in
the Cooney case yesterday in a manner
that brought the real issue right up in
plain sight of everybody.
The efforts of Captain Lees and the Fair
children to prove a" conspiracy in the
printing of fac-similes of the Crocker no
tarial blanks failed signally. Later in the
day the prosecution again lost another
D. M. DELMAS ON THE STAND.
point when Magistrate Cook, in prefer
ence to listening to the evidence of Max
Gumpel, the expert, decided he was com
petent to decide if the acknowledgments
on the pencil deeds were copies of the
Crocker blank.
Gumpel was in court to compare the
defects in the Cooney acknowledgments
with those in the proof of the form of
January 8, 1896. The court, after listen
ing to both sides, dispensed with Gum pel
and ordered that bromide photographic
enlargements of the - various documents
De made at once for comparison.
The Barry blanks and their object was
the subject of some lively legal sprinting
in the morning* sess on. The prosecution
was primed to explode the incident as a
regular bomb, bn: the powder seemed
very wet. At any rate there was no
noise, except a mutual interchange of
crusty compliments between George A.
Knight md W. XV. Foote. The latter had
some insinuations to make about "dirty
work" and "nawkshaws," and ' these
phrases did not improve the temper of
either young Fair's attorney, or Captain
Lees. I_B___-W
The developments established that the
Barry ceitihcates had b<*en printed for the
purpose of testing the skill of experts,
Attorneys D. M. Delmas, Patrick W.
lieddy, W. W. Foote nnd Detective fctii
well all swore that this was their purpose,
and that as far as Cooney was concerned
he was in no way connected with the
transaction. George A. Knight, who acted
as special prosecuting officer, fumed and
roared and intimated that there was soma
other motive in the printing. He was
sure that Cooney's detectives had been
collecting deeds, and he saw here the light
he was looking for. Cooney was going to
substitute the Barry forms in place of his
own printed acknowledgments. He even
read a clause from the Penal Code in a
dramatic manner to the effect tbat any
person who produced fac-similies of books
or papers for a fraudulent or deceptive
purpose was guilty of a felony.
But Knight rang the changes on his
lung keys in vain. The blanks had not
been printed with any purpose to deceive
or with any intention of fraud. They
were to be used in testing the skill oi ex
perts merely, was the answer of Cooney's
defense. â _ :'--â .-
They had a right to adopt such means
said the notary's lawyers. Experts might
swear away a man's liberty and surely
their testimony was subject to the dragnet
of cross-examination.
Magistrate Cook was of this opinion.
He could not see any conspiracy in the
Barry incident. He could not see how it
concerned Cooney at a.l or what ri-**ht it
had to a place in the case. But Knight
begged for more time. He thought he
could make the incident a lactor against
Cooney and he as given "a day, a week
or a year to do it.
The Fair people saw in D. M. Delmas
the central figure in the plot they would
materialize and had subpenaed "the at
torney to this end. The attorney began
by Mating that he had known Cooney
since last July, and was his legal adviser
now in a couple of civil actions. The way
was then opened to introduce the incident
of the printing of the Barry blanks. Wit
ness said it was his idea to have some re
productions of the Crocker blanks made
if possible. . He discussed the proposition
with Detective fctilwell some days ago,
with the result that a telephone message
called .Barry into the deliberations. The
printer was shown a copy of the Crocker
blank and asked if he could make a fac
simile of it, even to the paper. Barry
was doubtful on this last point and was
sure he could not get the right kind of
type. The attorney then narrated that
be had to leave the conference for the
purpose of catching a train. Barry and
the detective were left to arrange further
details.
A week ago Saturday the attorney re
ceived the package Of blanks while in
Reddy's office. As It happened, Reddy
himself delivered it to him.
"I opened the . package,'.' continued
Delmas. "and found about half a dozen
notarial certificates. I supposed at first
that they were some copies of the Crocker
blanks, but upon inspection I discovered
that they were rather poor reproductions
of it. I was afterward surprised to learn
that a large number of them had been
pr nted.
"Incidentally the Cooney case was dis
cussed at the time, so far as it related to
the issues involved in the civil litigation
pending before Judge Slack."
Del mas said he had met Cooney in all
about half a dozen limes. The attorney
then took .occasion to deny some news
paper rumors that the notary had been a
guest at his country home.
Magistrate Cook inquired if the Barry
blanks had been printed for the purpose of
deceiving the experts.
"Certainly not," was the reply. "They
were to be used to test tneir skill. These
men come into court and pretend to be
able to detect the smallest flaw in a docu
ment. I was simply preparing to test
their accuracy."
"That was your purpose?" queried
Knight.
"It was, and is now," replied the lawyer.
"If at some time before the trial of this
case 1 succeed in .obtaining what appear
to me to be exact copies of the Crocker
blanks, I shall present them in the civil
action, and mixing them up with the
originals, ask the experts to detect one
from another. I give you fair warning on
this subject. There is no need for secrecy
about this â none at all. It would serve no
purpose of mine to keep such a secret. 1
tell you now what I intend to do, and you
have a warning."
"Did you open the package of Barry
blanks?"
"Yes, in the presence of everybody in
the room."
"Was the. similarity between the copies
and the originals discussed?" -"- > .
"Of course, and by everybody in the
room."
Attorney Patrick W. R<~ddy was called
by the prosecution, but his narrative was
equally unsatisfactory for the cause of the
detective. . ; ;.....
Reddy saia though Barry was an inti
mate and close friend he knew nothing' of
any attempt being made to reproduce the
Crocker blanks until the editor handed
him the package for delivery to Delmas.
"I have no doubt that the project might
have Deeu suggested to my mind," said
He idy, ''because of an inquiry put to
Simon Wade during his examination."
"When the package was opened by Mr.
Delmas you discussed the similarity of the
Barry blanks io the Crocker proof?"
"Unquestionably."
"What was your idea in comparing the
forms?"
"We had expert testimony to meet and
we desired something to test it. I want
: to know if an expert can do what he says
j he can. I showed one of the blanks to J.
i J. Kennedy, a printer, who told me that
| it was not a good likeness of the original
as the word 'Crocker & Co.' appeared in
different type."
"Were 2000 of these blanks delivered at
your ofiice?"
"No; that report was a deliberate lie."
"Do you share in the desire to repro
â  duce the Crocker blank perfectly
"Yes; if the Barry blanks had been
] perfect reproductions we should have
given the experts notice that we were going
i to use them, but no attempt would have
, been made to deceive anybody with
them." '
Attorney. W. W. Foote desired to add
his version of the affair, but Knight
wanted to call Detective Stilwell. The
court allowed Foote to make a statement.
He related that be knew nothing of the
printing of the blanks until he learned of
it in court.
"But tho idea meets your recommenda
tion?" asked Knight.
"Ttbink anything is proper to catch
some of the dirty work going on in this
case," was the way Foote . returned the
compliment. "i think some blanks have
been printed in the East and smuggled
into Crocker's files."
Knight turned aside to confer with Cap
tnin Lees. The acid in Foote's throat
trickled out as he said savagely, "Oh ! I'll
answer any questions the Hawkshaws may
suggest." g&__H.
Both witness and inquisitor were warm
ing up rapidly. Knight demanded to
know what Foote meant by "dirty work
|in the case." Foote replied he knew it
was going on, but Magistrate Cook inter
rupted what promised to be a spicy dia
logue by ordering the phrase stricken out
of the record.
Detective Stilwell knew Cooney only
casually, meeting him for the first time
about six weeks ago in Delmas' office. Â«. ;
"Are you working for Cooney?" asked
Knight.
"No." .. .
"Are any of your men?"
"Not that I know of."
"Who employs you in the Fair case?"
"Mr. Delmas."'
Stillwell then went over the ground al
ready trodden by Delmas and Keddy. It
was he who practically ordered the blanks.
After the order had been given Barry in
quired how many copies were desired.
Stilwell learned that a ream of paper
would supply about .3000 blanks. "I told
Barry that we should ' probably Want
about 10,000 altogether," added the de
ttc'ive. j
"Why so many?" -7-
"Because if it were claimed by the other
side that the blank was a genuine Crocker,
that claim could hardly be sustained if we
produced 10.000 of them." -
"Have you served any subpenss in this
case?"
"No." .
Knight insinuated that Stilwell was
employed to collect deeds acknowledged
by Cooney for the purpose of substituting
Crocker certificates upon them. The de
tective returned an indignant denial. "I
have been collecting deeds for the same
purpose as the prosecution, lie concluded.
Fooie thought the Cooney side of the
case had as much right to collect deeds as
Captain Lee.*.
"Certainly you have," said the court.
* But Knight was determined to unearth
a conspiracy from some quarter. He put
one o. . StilweU's detectives, Miles J.
Bulger, or. the stand to learn that he had
collected three deeds that Coonev had
acknowledged. Knight proceeded to turn
over this bit of information when Magis
trate Cook called a halt. Knight pro
ceeded to again intimate conspiracy and
fraud. He accused the detectives of gath
ering deeds for Coonev for the sole pur
pose of substituting Crocker blanks for
the printed certificates on them. He
talked of "fact" and "circumstance" and
such like, and then turned to the Penal
Code to read that it was a felony to repro
duce papers for a fraudulent purpose.
"But these witnesses say they had uo
such Durpose," added Magistrate Cook.
"Well, we'll prove it"
"When?"
"Not this morning.
"To-morrow morning?"
"1 don't know."
"We'll give you a day, a month or a
year," put in Reddy.
"I don't want to monkey with this case
any such length of time," said Knight.
"Oh, there's money enough in it to keep
you going." rejoined Foote sarcastically,
and the prosecution abandoned this line
of inquiry for the day.
The next part called for the introduc
tion of the expert testimony of Max Gum
pel and the lawyers began at once to quote
law.
Reddy opposed the introduction of this
kind of evidence. Anybody could read
what tie printed matter on the Crocker
proofs was and anybody might compare it
with that on the Cooney acknowledg
ments. Experts were in the natural order
of things prejudiced to the interests that
employed them.
"And the Dias that exists in the mind
runs through the magnifying glass," he
concluded.
District Attorney Hosmer in reply cited
instances of experts being employed to
detect flaws in wood, iron, to tell how the
panel of a door had been whittled out by
a jack-knife, and many other instances.
Way then, he asked, should an expert
printer not be called to point out the de
fects in type visible on tbe Crocker proofs?
Reddy said even if the Crocker blanks
and the Coon y certificates were identical
typographically, it did not follow that
they were printed at. the same time, as
"both were machine made, and the world
was full of type."
Magistrate Cook, in giving his decision,
said that exnert testimony at best was
unsatisfactory. He would be his own ex
pert and compare the certificate on the
pencil deeds with the Crocker proois by
means of having bromide photographic
enlargements made .of both.
"It they are alike! can see for myself,
and upon this I think the case of the pros
ecution must stand or fall."
COoney's attorneys readily assented to
the idea ana Lees and the Prosecuting
Attorney fell in line a moment later.
This morning at 10 o'clock the attorneys
and Magistrate Cook will meet in court
to supervise the photographing oart of
the programme. The Cooney people say
that tiiey expect that the "camera will
win the case for them without the trouble
of calling any witnesses for the defense at
all.
The civil case on the pencil deeds is
down on Judge Slack's calendar for to
day, but will undoubtedly be postponed
owing to a delay in preparing the jury
list.
RURAL RESIDENTS' MAIL.
Opening of an Extensive Experi
mental Route Below San
Jose.
Twenty-Sev.*n Square Miles to Be
Covered Once Every Twenty-
Four Hours.
The first experimental rural free mail !
delivery route in California began opeia
tions yesterday, and the result of Its work
ings is looked ior with much interest by
the Postoffice authorities.
The route embraces a territory of
twenty-seven square miles, just south of
i San Jose, with Campbells as a starting
and collection point.
This section is thickly populated, con
taining some 1600 well-to-do people, woo
own small tracts of land Irom live to
twenty-five acras.
Congress recently made an appropria
tion of $40,000 to try the experiment of
rural delivery in some twenty different
States, and Postoffice Inspectors Erwin
and Thrall were intrusted with the im
portant duty of selecting a route in Cali
iornia that would make a fair test of the
feasibility of the plan.
They chose the section mentioned after
a long" search principally because of the
i character of the inhabitants, and also be-
I cause of the magnificent highways that
the ranchers have constructed.
There are three carriers, each having
his own conveyance and the twenty
seven square miles is divided between
them.
The mail from San Francisco reaches
Campbells at 10:32 a. m., and the carriers
are expected to leave on tneir routes by
11 o'clock, returning with' the "mail col
lected about sunset.
They receive only a small remuneration
from ihe Government, but are permitted
to carry on an tiprisa and delivery busi
ness as long as their mail is deliyered on
time.
T.iose who profit by the daily delivery j
are expected to put up boxes for the re- j
ception of mail at convenient points, so i
that the earners may lose as little time as
possible in delivering it.
The experiment will end on July 1, |
when tt is expected that the appropriation
will be exhausted. From the data that is
to be obtained in the meantime the Post
office Department will decide whether it
is worth while to make the service per
manent and establish it in various parts
of the country.

New Tomb of the Savior.
' About twenty Episcopal ministers, mem

banquet last night at the Occidental Hotel.
Bishop Nichols presided. The main feature
besides the banquet was a talk by the Rev
Hackett-Smith, 1) D., on the newiv discovered
tomb of the Savior in Palestine, the reverend
gentleman treated the subject from an archeo
logical point of view, and his effort was really
toward the establishing of a new place of
burial of the Savior. Rev. Haeketi-Smtth has
spent much time in the Holy Land, and espe
cially in the vicinity of Jerusalem, in recent
years.

Witnesses.
I accept the conditions above.
(Signed), MRS. LOU HOLSTROM.
The signature of the young girl who
signed this agreement with Mrs.' Hol
strom is purposely omitted, as she is now
huppily married and is doing all in her
power to make amends for the mistake
of her earlier life.
This quitclaim deed to the person of a
bright little" girl now about four years old
isa strange feature relative to the posses
sion of the human property in question.
Back of it lies a story with a moral, the
moral being, "Never adopt a child with
out the fact being legally recorded."
Early yesterday morning Secretary
Frank Kane of the Society for the Preven
tion of Vice, accompanied by Police
Officer Tom Coleman, went to the resi
dence of Mrs. Lou Holstrom. at 47G>_J
Eighth street, and .forcibly took and car
ried away little Effie I. V. Hoistrom, a
child that Mrs. Holstrom has cared for
and loved for the past four years. Later
in the day Mrs. Holstrom went to the
secretary for the Prevention, of Cruelty to
Children and made a bitter complaint
against the secretary of the other society
lor taking from her the little girl. In
substance she told the following story:
â¢ "Pour years ago my husband was at
Empire City, Or., engaged in . working
upon the Government j**tty. One day I
met Dr. Thrasher, who was then on
Twenty- fifth ana Valencia, streets, and
told him that I wanted to adopt a little
girl. He said that he had one on his
hands that he would be glad to get rid of,
as the child was born out of wedlock. I
saw the child and took a liking to it.
"The mother was at the doctor's house,
and sne freely gave up the little one to
me upon my promise that I would give
her $10. 1 agreed to her proposition, and
she asked me to send the money to Dr.
Thrasher, as she was not limey to remain
there long. Then she gave me the child
and this writing, promising never to ask
me for the child. . â¢_."'
"1 went to my husband at Empire City
with the child and sent the $'1C to Dr.
Thrasher to be given to Kllie's mother.
Since then I have taken excellent care ol
the child, whom ~ve all love dearly.
"A while ago, after my return to this
City, Dr. Tnrasher called on me and told
me that the mother of my little girl
wanted to get the child Dack again. He
said that tbe woman nad married well
and bad induced her husband to let her
adopt a little girl, as they were both very
land of cnildren. I refused to part with
little Effie, telling him that I loved the
child too well to part with her. 'â /â . J././IJ
"Several days later Mrs. Thrasher called
upon me on the same errand, and when I
told her that I would not let the little one
go on any consideration she threatened to
lake her from me by force and told me
that the paper I had was of no account.
"Last Saturday a woman called at my
house, saying that she was ih search of
rooms, but no sooner did she see Effie
than she declared herself to be Elite's
mother, and she made the same demand
upon me tnat Dr. Tiirasher and his wife
did. I told the woman what I thought of
her tor celling Â«he child to me in the first
place and for demanding its return in the
second place, and again I said that I
would never part with the little one. .7
"To-day the officers came to my house
and I let them in. No sooner were they
inside than they opened the door and ad
mitted that woman' who had 'sold the child
to me. Well, by showing their police stars
they took tne child away from me by
force, not even giving me a chance to
wash or dress her. , One of my family fol
lowed them to the Youth's Directory. I
will go to law. In some way I will get
the child back again." '
Deputy Hoi brook stated that the mother
of the child had called at the office of the
society and complained that Mrs. Hol
strom was not a tit person to care for the
child. The officers "had investigated the
woman's character and they could not
find anything wrong in the child's sur
roundings. There would have been but
little trouble, they said, if the Holstroms
had legally adopted the little one.
Secretary Kane of the other society
stated that the part he had played was to
see that the real mother got possession of
her child, as she had a perfect right to do,
seeing that the writing held by Mrs.
Holstrom was not worth the paper on
which it was written. He, too. maintained
that Mrs. Holstrom was not fit to raise
litilt Effie. Kane added that the child
had been given into the custody of its true
mother. He positively declined to give
the name or address of tho mother, saying
that the mother had married a worihy
man and was living happily, and to bring
her into notoriety would be to break up
the family. .
FOUND IN A DOORWAY.
A Woman Apparently Suffering From
Morphine Poison Taken to the
Kece.ving Hospital.
A woman about 28 years of age was
found last night by a citizen in a doorway
on San Jose avenue, near Thirtieth street, j
in an unconscious condition. The patrol
wagon was summoned from the Seven
teenth-street police station, and she was
taken to the Receiving Hospital. Dr.
fitzjibbon found that she was in a critical
condition, and was evidently suffering
from morphine poisoning.
In her pocket was lound a phial on
--Â was printed "morphine and atro- '
pine," and a prescription from Dr. James
Frost tor morphin** and atropine tablets
dated February 18. 1896: *
A memorandum-book was also found in
her p<cket, on which was wrute:. in pen
cil the address, "Mrs. Robert Hall,
Diamond and Surrey streets, Castro- .
street Addition." Captain Gillen was
notified of that fact and of her condition,
and he detailed an officer to make an in-
ligation. ~ 7 ;.V*
It is thought probable that the woman
may have taken an overdose of morphine
by mistake, or it may have been taken
with suicidal intent. ." â¢ "â¢ 7Â° "
Her husband, Robert Hall, - was "placed
under arrest early this morning pending
an investigation. VV-." .*'= *--"â¢â *' - I

DETECTIVES PHOTOGKAPHED.
Another Day of Weary Waiting for the
Swanhilda to Appear Off the Fort*
The detectives waiting on Meiggs wharf'
for the Swanhilda cut another botch in
their sticks yesterday and talked -learned-. '
ly of how the. foul bottom of the long
looked-for -ship is holding her back, but '
that she must be off the coast even now. '
During the afternoon several group pho
tographs were made of the detectives -at â  .
the little harbor police station on Meiggs \
wharf. They were obtained for Agent
Hoeue of the Swanhilda for the purpose of*
sending them to Australia as souvenirs of ='
the present notorious voyage.
The last picture, taken in front of the
station and in the presence of a hundred. ' ;
or more curious onlookers, -was a group
with McHattie, Roche and Conroy, the '
Australian sleuths, seated in the fore
ground, and Euan, Sergeant - Runner, :
Ferguson and Silvey, the local officers,
standing behind. V
In the evening Sergeant Buntier, pre- .
pared a genuine Irish stew, and there was
enough of it to feed a dozen men, but
when the detectives finished eating there
was not enough left to offer McllattiVs
pet parrot, perched always above the labia
on an unused ga3 fixture. 'â¢*.; - *:
