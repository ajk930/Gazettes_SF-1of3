The view is taken from a point near Phourka Pass, about seven miles directly
south of DhomoKO. in the middle of the picture wbere the main body of the Greek
army under Prince Constantine is posted.
North of Dhomoko in the distance is the little town of Vrysia, "the Village ol
; Springs." at the extreme eastern end of the southern limb of the plain which is oc
j cnpied by the main body of the Turkish advance. Vrvsia lies near the main highway
i from Thessaly, over the Orthrys Mountains to Southern Greece, which, coming from

! Alagopati, crosses the Marsby plain, enters the hill country again, and leaving
j Dhomoko to the west, noes on south through Phourka Pars.
A little to the southeast of Vrysia is the village of Tchasmot, occupied by another
body of Turkish troopÃ. Throu h this village runs another road from Pharsala to
the south nearly parallel to the main road, whicn it joins after massing through th Â«>

White was armel with a large stone and
Incram picked up a lump of coal and an
i iron stove poker, and the men went out
into the front yard. White threw the
stone, which struck Ingram in the breast.
Ingram then threw the coal and fol

AIRSHIP PILOTED
OVER TENNESSEE
Soared Above Nashville
and Disappeared in
the Night.
Described Successive Circles
Subject to the Will of the
Navigator.
Vary Windy In the Heavens, but at
Midnight It Was Seen Coming
Back to Port.
NASHVILLE, Tejjn., May 13. â Pro
fessor Arthur Barnard sailed away to
night on a second trip in his newly in
vented airship. Preparations for the sec
ond voyage have been in progress since
last Thursday, when the first experiment
was made. Although the weather was
unsatisfactory it was decided to make the
trip this afternoon.
Owing to the fact that the ship wns not
filled to its full capacity with gas, the bal
last, consisting of bags of sand, was re
moved, the navigator deciding to make
the trip without them. Considerable de
lay was experienced in the preparations,
and it was about 7 o'clock when the ship
arose from the earth. The wind was
blowing at the rate of about six miles an
hour from the southwest.
The manipulator of the machine got a
hearty cneer aa he passed far above the
beads of the people who thronged the ex
position grounds, but he was too busy op
erating the craft to make any response.
While passing over the grounds Barnard
turned the shiD around several times,
evidently to show that it was subject to
his will. Yet the ship continued to drift
with the wind, which was blowing directly
over the city proper. Before the ascent
Barnard announced that he intended to
make a circuit of the lair grounds and the
city, but when last seen he was some dis
tance beyond the city limits and going in
the direction of the wind.
News was received here at 12:45 o'clock
to-night thai the airship had been ob
served near Florence station, about thirty
miles due south, coming toward the city.
LOOKS DARK FOR ROMEYN.
Believed That the Verdict of the Court-
Martial Is Dismissal From the
Army.
NEW YOKK, N. V., May 13.â Captain
Henry Romeyn, Fifth Infantry, tried at
Fort McPlierson, Atlanta, on the charge
of conduct unbecoming an officer and
gentlemen, will not learn tne decision of
the court until it has been passed upon by
the President and Secretary Alger.
As Romeyn reaches the age of retiie
ment on June 1 the findings of the court
will immediately be reviewed by the
President and Secretary, to whom they
were sent to-day. The fact that the Presi
dent will pass on the case is indicative
that the court's judgment is probably dis
missal from service. There is said to be
also a strong recommendation that the
regulation making it compulsory for an
officer's family to reside at the post where
the officer is stationed be annulled.
Tne findings of the court and the evi
dence reached General Merritt last Mon
day. They have been carefully reviewed
by General Merritt and the assistant
judge advocate, General Barr. If the de
cision of the court has been finally con
firmed, rejectpd or altered by them the
result of tne trial would be made public
here. But an officer cannot be dismissed
from the service by a court-martial in
time of peace without the approval of the
President and Secretary of War. If the
court recommends tnat the accused be
acquitted, or simply reprimanded, lhe
final decision rests with tne iudge advo
cate general and the commander of the
department. If the court recommends
dismissal, and the department com
mander concurs, then tne case goes to the
President.
So explicit is militajy law on this sub
ject that there seems to be no doubt that
the verdict is that Captain Romeyn be
dismissed. â¢ â¢ -

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 13.â This
was a day of great activity in tne While
Horse. Until after luncheon the Presi
dent denied nimself to all callers, exclud
ing even Senators and Representatives.
The cause of this was the fact that Secre
tary Long, Judge Day and E. T. Atkins, a
sugar planter from Boston, were with the
President. All the Cabinet Ministers, ex
cepting Wilson of the Agricultural De
partment, also saw the President. Secre
tary Sherman came in shortly after 9
o'clock and made another visit later in the
day. Congressman Loud made two visits
also. Secretary Alger spent nearly an
hour in private conference. But each of

discussed.
A delegation of thirty persons from At
lantic City invited the President to attend
the annual G. A. R. encampment on June
9. Minister Buck, who sails for Japan
May 29, saw the President also. His
original intention was to leave San Fran

PRESIDENT M'KINLEY WILL
FEE FARE A MESSAGE.
Weylor's Blood-Stalnad Hands To
Be Stayed and / merlcan
Prisoners Protected.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 13.â At
both the White House and Capitol the
Cuban question was discussed to-day, and
there is every indication ihat unusual ef
forts are being made -o bring the adminis
tration and Congress into harmonious
support of a Cuban policy in line with that
demanded by public sentiment.
The Committee on Foreign Relations
was in session over two hours, going over
correspondence between the State Depart
ment and representatives of the Govern
ment in Spain ana Cuba regardin-.; the
condition of affairs on the island. This
correspondence was laid before a sub
corn mitiee, composed of Davis, Foraker
;md Morgan, at Secretary Sherman's resi
dence last night and by them reported to
the full committee t!iis morning.
Officials of the State Department were
present at the conference last night and
selected from a mass of documents those
that have a direct bearing upon the pres
ent question. The committee did not
complete its task this morning, but pro
gressed lar enougu to become convinced
that now is the time to act. It agreed
with Secretary Sherman that there are
certain portions of the correspondence
it would not be proper to lay before the
Senate even in confidence or made public
at the present time. Indeed Secretary
Sherman so strongly believes the publi
cation of certain confidential reports from
the Government agents in Cuba would
lead to great trouble, perhaps to blood
shed, that be withheld them from mem
bers of the committee, and will continue
to do so long as he thinks that course is
necessary for the protection of life and
property in Cuba.
Such of the reports as tne Secretary felt
warranted in placing before the commit
tee show a state of affairs in Cuba that
cannot much longer continue without in
terference by this Government. The re
ports show that there is not now and
never has been any basis for the claims
that any portion of Cuba's provinces has
been "pacified. ;I but on the other hand
the insurgents are stronger and more nu
merous. Spain has almost entirely ex
hausted her resources and her troops are
fast being withdrawn for services else
where.
The report? also show a most deplorable
state of affairs regarding the lives and
property of American citizens on the
island. Destruction has been rampant
everywhere, and murders, outrages and
starvation a matter of daily occurrence.
Information thus eiven the committee
in an official form after all, however, ij
merely confirmatory of what has been
known all along, but it is thought its pub
lication with the sanction of the adminis
tration and the committee will create a
public sentiment that will brine about
the passage of the Morgan resolu tion foi
the recognition of belligerency at a very
early day. Morgan allowed the resolu
tion to go over until Tuesday through a
desire to allow the Committee on Foreign
Rlations to finish its examination of the
Cuban correspondence before the debate
on the resolution is renewed. It probably
will be callea up on Tuesday and Moreau
hopes to have it disposed of before open
ing the tariff bill debate, which is now set
for May 24.
General interest in the Cuban question
and the acuteness of the situation was in
creased by the fact that a long conference
took place at the White House between
t..e President, Judge Day, Secretary Lons;
and E. T. Atkins of Boston. The confer
ence jrave rise to all sorts of reports as to
the crisis in Cuban affairs, the sendine ol
a warship to the island, etc. The truth,
is, however, there was no important de
velopment at the conference. The Presi
dent is deeply interested in the questioD
and seeking every means of obtaining in
formation. He has directed Secretary
Sherman to lay before the Committee on
Foreign Relations every possible piece o 1
information that should properly be
brought to its knowledge. His policy
however, is still what was announced 05
Foraker in the Senate on Tuesday: "He
will learn from his special commissioner,
Calhoun, as to the actual condition o<
affairs on the island and will then h>
ready to announce further action by tin
administration. At present he intends tc
take no definite action beyond aisistioi2
the Senate committee in getting posses
sion of all the facts."
After the White House conference Sec
retary Long told a Call reporter his vis:t
bad nothing ;o do with sending warships
to Cuba. He pronounced a report to that
effect false. Atkins, he said, had called
on him this morning and acquiesced in
the suggestion to tell President McKinley
what he had learned during a four months'
residence in Cuba from which he had just
returned. The Secretary added he knew
Atk ns as a wealthy gentleman of Boston,
having large property interests in Cuba,
and vouched for his reliability to the Pres
ident.
The President is having the main fea
turesbf the Government's Cuban agents'
reports embodied in a message which he
wiil send either to the Foreign Relations
Committee or to Congress probably on
Monday, accompanied by a recommenda
tion that an appropriation bs made imme
diately for the relief of starving Ameri
cans in Cuba. The President is said to be
astounded at the s riousness of the situa
lion regarding American prisoners in
Cuba. He deems it the first duty of this
Government to care tor them. Themes
sage will be vigorous on this point.
TO END THE WAR.
Merchants and Bankers Getting Up
a Memorial for Presentation
to Congress.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 13.â The me
morial which a number of merchants and
tankers of this city have been getting up,
asking the Govsrnment to put an end to
the war in Cuba and restore peace, will be
i re?ented to Secretary Sherman within
the next ten days. The greatest secrecy
has been observed by those interested in
the memorial.
The firm which undertook the work of
drawine up the memorial and getting sig
natures was Mosle Brothers, bankers of
16 Exchange place. (Representatives of
the firm have been In conference some
time with a number of leading bankers
and merchants of ihe city who have inter
ests in Cuba, and the memorial was not
ii rafted until most of them bad agreed to
sign.
In order to facilitate matters several
copies of the memorial were sent to Bos
ton and Philadelphia, where signatures
were speedily obtained and returned to
this city. The original memorial is now
in the safe of Mosle Brothers, and will re
main there till forwarded to Washington.
Adolph Pavenstedt, a member of this
firm, in refusing to allow a copy of the
memorial to be published, said to-day:
â¢â¢We had resolved to keep the matter
secret until it is presented to Secretary
Sherman, and although the matter leaked
out we shall continue to refuse to give any
information to newspapers. Everybody
who has been asked to sign has been re
quested at the same time to keep the mat
ter secret. There are several hundred sig
natures now, and the memorial will be
presented to Sherman within the next ten
days."
From other sources it was learned the
memorial simply requests the Govern
ment, in the interest of humanity and
commerce, to take such steps as it can to
stop the war. The signers, in support of
their position, point out numerous facts
to show tht destruction of property in
Cuba during the past two years, and con
sequent destruction of trade between the
island and this country. Prior to 1895 our
imports from Cuba averaged $75,000,000 a
year and our exports about $25,000,000. In
18S6 our imports were reduced to $30,000,
--000 and exports to $7,000,000.

ANOTHER STENCH
IN THE SENATE
Sugar Stocks Specter
Stalks Forth the
Second Time.
Pointed Talk by Tillman on
Scandal Arising From
Tariff Bill.
Broker Chapman Resolution Sent
to a Committee Which May
Not Resurrect It.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 13.â There
was a lively time in the Senave to-day
over Allen's resolution providing that
Broker Chapman, the witness who had
refused to answer questions in the sugar
trust investigations of 1894 and who was
convicted of misdemeanor before the
Criminal Court of the District of Colum
bia, be compelled to prssent himself at
the bar of the Senate and purge himself of
contempt by answering the questions as
to what Senators dealt in sugar-stock cer
tificates as a condition precedent to his
pardon.
The discussion lasted two hours and a
half and was enlivened by jibes and sar
casm from Chandler and fiery suggestions
from Tillman that it was not a three-year
old matter which the Senate should be
giving attention to, but the charges of
newspaper correspondents that before the
Finance Committee reported back tho
Dinjjley tariff bill last week Senators who
knew of the proposed changes in the
sugar schedule had taken advantage of
the knowledge in order to speculate in
sugar securities of the trust. The final
result was the reference of Alien's resolu
tion to the Judiciary Committee.
The reso.ution came up as unfinished
business, and Allen read extracts from
the printed official report of the investi
gation to show that Chapman well under
stood the law on the subject when he re
fused to answer questions. Allen thought
that the Senate, in vindication of itself
and its authority that had been openly
and flagrantly defied, ought to take the
matter in hand.
Fauikner said that if Chapman should
come to the Senate in a contrite spirit
and acknowledge his crime, it would be a
greater vindication of the power of the
Senate and the dignity of the American
people than his imprisonment.
White argued that Chapman had been
adjudged guilty of an offense against the
law of the United States, and the Senate
had absolutely no jurisdiction on the
question of pardoning him. The pardon
ing power was vested exclusively in the
executive, if the Senate was to adopt the
resolution offered, it would be a sugges
tion to the executive that Chapman
should be pardoned if he came before the
Senate and answered the questions, and
that he should not be pardoned unless he
did so. From his standpoint he regarded
it aa impropriety to adopt such & resolu
tion, even in the absence of any petition
from the offending party.
Daniel moved to amend the resolution
so that it would simply require Chapman
to appear before the Senate and pur^e
himself of contempt.
Replying to a question of TiHman,
Chandler sad he did not believe Chap
man had passed beyond the jurisdiction
of the Senate if the Senate chose to fur
ther pursue him. "If," he continued,
"there were any Senators engaged in spec
ulating in sugar stocKs (which God forbid
be possible) that has been three or four
years ago, a period in which evidence had
time to disappear. Collateral evidence,
which would nave been useful if this wit
ness had answered, and if facts had been
discovered at the time, is now gone, and
it is utterly futile to go on with the in
vestigation. I am sure the committee
would find out nothine."
As Cnandler concluded Tillman impa
tiently broKe in: "It seems to me we are
not after Chapman. The original in
vestigation was to discover whether any
Senator had been guilty of using bis of
ficial position to make money by specu
lating in stocks. To-day there are news
paper charges floating about that last
week, when the new tariff bill was re
ported, three Senators speculated in stock
of the sugar trust. We have another
stench on our hands, and instead of its
being a differential of one-third of a cent
in favor of the trust, as that was, it is now
a differential of two-thirds of a cent.
"Two correspondents have charged," he
continued, "over their own signatures,
that Senators have been speculating on
this within the last week and have made
money. If you want to investigate yon
have now new reason. If you want to get
at the true inwardness of the matter and
punisn those who are guilty do so or else
bush up. That is the whole sum and sub
stance of it. We do not want Chapman ;
we want Havemeyer. We want the man
who bought your men, if they were
bought. We want the man who bought
your committee last week, if it was
bought And now let the Senator from
Nebraska take his resolution to the com
mittee and bring back something that will
mean something. We can now make
these correspondents state where they got
their information or, if they refuse, can
punish them for contempt. We can call
Havemeyer and the grandees of the sugar
trust and make them answer or put them
In jail for contempt. Either investigate
so as to find the truto and punish the
criminals or hush."
Chandler asked Allen whether it was
proposed that the Senaie should take ud
tne old inquiry as to the dealings of Sena
tors in sugar stock.
"I had not contemplated anything of
the kind," Allen replied. "My contem
plation is that the Senate would be con
temptible in the eyes of the world if it did
not speak out on this subject. Here is a
proposition to pardon a man for a misde
meanor committed against the Senate,
and we are caviling and contending it to
be a matter of indelicacy for us to express
our opinion. I have Deen here long
enough to know that whenever the Senate
does not want to do anything about a
resolution the Senate has it referred to a
committee. And so the country may un
derstand now t at when this resolution
goes to a committee it goes there for all
time."
After some further debate tbÂ« resolu.
ton was referred to the Committee on
Judiciary.
Af er the Chapman debate and a short
executive session, the Senate spent the
remainder of the day in tariff discussion.
Aldricb, in charge of the bill, stated that
owing to the unavoldab c delay in the
preparation of the comparative statement
jvhich was to accompany the measure
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 14, 1897.
and the desire of the Democrats for more
time, he would not call the bill up next
Tuesday, but hoped to call it up next
Thursday, and certainly not later than
the 24th.
Jones of Arkansas, Democratic member
of the Finance Committee, said it had
been a physical impossibility to complete
the comparative statement before. All
the available force of the Bureau of Sta
tistics 1190 been at work, and it was only
finished to-day. It had gone to the
printer and would be ready to-morrow.
Owing to the short time it would give the
Democrats to examine the bill in conjunc
tion with the comparative statement, he
thought it would be impossible tor the
minority to be ready until a week from
next Monday.
After a long but unimportant discus
sion in reference to the duty on wool, the
Senate adjourned to next Monday.
BUCK GOING TO HONOLULU.
New Minister to Japan Will Uclo a Pass-
ing Investigation for Use at
Tikio.
WASHINGTON. D. C. May 13.-The
Star, an annexation paper, says: That
ihe administration is keeping a watchful
eye on the situation in Hawaii was ascer
tained beyond a doubt in the informa
tion received by a Star reporter to-day
that Colonel E. A. Buck, the new Min
ister to Japan, will stop at Honolulu on
the way to his post.
Minister Buck's intentions have been to
leave San Francisco June 5. He has now
decided to leave San Francisco on the
29th of this month. He will spend a week
at Honolulu and will take the next pass
ing steamer for Japan. He will probably
leave San Francisco with Harold Sewall,
ihe new Minister to Hawaii. They will
be together a week in Honolulu, ana in
that time will be able to jointly acquire a
great deal of valuable information as to
the exact situation of the influx of Japa
nese into the islands.
Of course it is impossible to learn from
Colonel Buck or Mr. Sewall the nature of
their instructions. It is known, however,
that the administration has been deluged
with stories of the alleged attempts of the
Japanese to colonize the islands and, in
time, start a revolution to secure posses
sion of them. Tne dispatch of the war
ship Philadelphia to Honolulu and re
cent developments in other ways have
been sufficient to keep all eyes open.
The Japanese legation here l:as persist
ently denied that Japan has any designs
on the islands. The reports, however,
have evidently become so conflicting to
President McKinley that he has decided
to ascertain for himself just what is going
on. He has given the instructions under
which Minister Buck will oc:. The knowl
edge whid> Minister Buck will get in Hon
olulu will be of benefit to him when he
reaches Japan. He will be in a position
to more readily understand the futu.e
movements of the Japanese.
Another matter is that of annexation,
Minister Sewall is supposed to favor annex
ation, and many people believe the plans
of the administration tend to ultimate
annexation. It thia b the case, and Japan
being interested more than any other
country, it is a diplomatic movement to
have Minister Buck post himself as much
aa possible on the situation in Hawaii and
Japan.

WHERE HE'S "AT"
Jerry Simpson Is Sup
pressed by Speaker
Reed.
The Kansas Statesman Causes
the Vote of the Republican
Majority to Be Divided.
Considerable Tims Wasted In the
House In Rather Useless
Argument.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 13 âThe
controversy between Jerry Simpson and
Speaker Reed assumed an acute phase in
the House to-day. Simpson objected to
approving the journal, and the debate on
a formal motion that it be approved was
utilized by him to repeat criticisms upon
the Speaker and the majority of the House
for refusing io proceed under the rules
and appoint committees.
Three times Simpson was called to or
der and twice permitted by a vote of the
House to proceed "in order," enough Re
publicans voting outright in his favor or
refraining from voting. This was the first
time the Republican majority has been
divided this session. This apparently
emboldened Simpson. When he was
called to order again by Dingley, Speaker
Reed made an unusually extended state
ment. The conduct and actions of the
Speaker, he said, were not above criticism,
but the proper method to oxpre3s that
criticism was by action of the House. The
Speaker could not reply to such attacks as
bad been made and it was not desirable
that he should. These repeated assaults,
to which no adequate response could be
made, were clearly out of order and the
fact must present itself to every gen
tleman who respected the honor and
dignity of the House.
A motion that Simpson be again per
mitted to proceed in order was made by
Teiry (D.) of Arkansas, and disagreed toâ
71 to 86.
Upon the announcement of the vote
Simpson said :
"Mr. Speaker: I understand the chair
has ruled I cannot proceed out of order.
By this vote the House has decided I can
p.ot proceed in order. I want to know
where I am at."
The Speaker (promptly)â The chair has
never been able to find anybody who knew
that. [Great laughter, during which
Simpson subsided.]
The journal was approved, and after an
hour and a half wasted in objections tne
conference report on the Indian appro
priation bill was agreed toâ s4 to 47.
The House adjourned until Monday.
FITZ ON THE FOUL BLOW.

BALTIMORE, Mp , May 13.â 80b Fitz-
Simmons, when asked about tbe renon
that tbe pictures of the verascope show
bim fouling Corbett by hitting him in the
fourteenth round while Jim was on his
knee:, laughed and declared it a fake.
"That is all Brady's doings," said the
champion, "ani it's a lie. Brady says he
got on the inside and saw the pictures.
Well, I'll bet him f.5000 I nevpr struck a
ioul blow, and I'll bet him $10,000 that
the verascope will not show a hit that's
foul. What it will s. ow is Corbett on his
knees and me in an attitude to bit him
again, but I aw that he was down and
didn't let go.
"Something else it will show is that
Corbett fouled me three times in the same
round by hitting me below the belt. . I
know wha< I did and how I did it. Why,
Corbett said himself I didn't foul him.
Tint is alia ereat fake and scheme of
Brady's to excite sympathy and mafce

everybody will go to see the verascope to

PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., May 13.â The
cadets of St. Mathew's Military School of
San Mateo, who are in camp at this place,
this evening tendered a reception to their
instructors and other guests in the par
lors of El Carmeio Hotel. The rooms
used for the reception were prettily decor

and the flag of the battalion was ranged
in graceful folds over the spot where tne
youthful officers received their guests.
The natty uniforms of the boys, mingled
with the somber black of the civilians'
clothes and the dainty gowns of tie
ladies, helped to produce a brilliant effect,
which was heightened by the excellent
music furnished from time to time by the
cadet band.
To-morrow at 2 o'clock there will be a

The Government to improve lta Alaskan
&temm*hlp Service.
TORT TOWNSEXD, Wash.. May 13.â
Residents of Alaska w:ll rejoice to know
that the recent orders issued to the
United States steamer Pinta at Sitka to
proceed to the navy-yard at Mare Island,
Cal., are the forerunner of an improve
ment in the Government's service in the
Northern Territory. The Pinta will not,
as supposed, be repaired at Mare Island,
but will upon arrival tnere be relegated
to a well-earned rest from future service
in Rotten Row, while her place at the
Alasnan capital will be taken by the gun
boat Marietta, now rapidly nearing com
pletion at the San Francisco construc
tion yard. TbÂ«* Pinta has been on duty
at Sitka since 1884, but has never been of
any use, it being impossible to utilize her
except in the mildest weather, when there
is no need ior her services. It is said of
the Pinia mat she never raised anchor
without breaking down.
BUHGLAHI AT FttEXCH CAMP.
Considerable Plunder Taken Frntn Bor~

STOCKTON. Cal., May 13 âBorland's
general iue~cbandise store at French
Camp was burglarized last night, it being
the second successful burglary com
mitted in the town recently. The store
room of tbo establishment was entered,
the door being opened by a skeleton
key. From the storeroom the main store
was entered and a quantity of dry goods
and some provisions were stolen.
The matter was reported to the Sheriff's
office this morning and Deputy Sheriff
Wall went out to investigate. Constables
Carroll and Beach also went out, but none
of the officers were able to obtain any
tangible clew. It is thought that the
same parties did both of the jobs. Mr.
Borland suspected no one and aid not
notice any one loitering around his
place before the burglary. It is certain,
however, that whoever is doing the house
breaking; is familiar with the places that
he selects to burglariz?.

DURRANT'S DAYS
AT SAN QUENTIN
Hopeful That Something
Will Turn Up to
Save Him.
Amos Lunt, the Guard, Would
Torture Him With a
Red hot Iron.
Believes That the Murderer Is
Weakening, but Ha Shows No
Sign of Fear.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON. Cal., May
13. â Less than one month remains before
the day set foi the execution of Theodore
Durrantâ June 11. The time has now
narrowed down to weeks, and soon it will
be days, then hours â and death.
Durrant's prison life has been almost
without incident. Were it not for the
curious crowds that beg at the gates of
the orison for a glimpse of the condemned
man, the fact that the murderer is con
fined within the walla of the great peni
tentiary would not De bo glaringly evi
dent. But Ourrant is already dead to the
worid. He has requested that no visitors,
save his faithful father and mother and
his vigilant attorneys, be allowed to see
him, and the prison authorities respect
his wishes.
Hope is not dead in bis breast. His con
fidence in the powers of his attorneys to
save his life even now has not relaxed.
He walks back and forth in the bi<r prison
yard during the few hours the condemned
murderers are allowed to breathe tbe pure
air. The exercise is the same each day.
Then into cell 21, facing the plaza beauti
ful with flowers, the murderer of Blanche
Lament returns. The great iron door is
closed with a bang, the bolts are slipped
and the guard turns the key in the lock.
The key is then taken to the main door of
the prison, where Guard KeJly takes it
and locks it in tbe safe.
In a large apartment beneath the cell ol
Dnrrant the members of the prison band
are locked. The members practice from 5
o'clock till after 7. Every note is heard
by the condemned man above. He has
said he does not mind it, in fact enjoys
hearing them play because he loves music.
Bo day by day the time flits by.
Not the slightest trouble does the cele
bratea prisoner cause his keepers. Not
an attempt at self-destruction has he
made, ana the gnards, who learn to judge
men as no others can, say that the youth
ful murderer will never take his own life.
When he is led to the barber-shop to be
sbav. (1 he is accompanied by two guards,
who watch every move, The convict who
araws the razor across the features ol
Durrant is trustworthy, and were Durrani
to make an attempt to gain possession oi
the razor to commit suicide the guards
are ready to thwart the attempt.
If there is one raun more than anothei
who believes the young medical studem
guilty of the horrible murder of which he
is convicted, that man is Amos Lunt, one
of the guards. He will grasp the arm ot
Theodore Durrant at the door of the death
chamber, and lead him up the thirteen
steps to the gallows. He is the man who
will place the noose around his neck and,
alter pulling tight the knot, give the
signal that will drop the murderer into
eternity. Twelve times has he already
done this duty.
"I believe," said Lunt, "that Theodore
Durrant murdered both of those innocent
girls in cold blood. His face to me is that
of the fiendish and horrible criminal that
I believe he is, and when 1 place the rope
around his neck, as I expect to do on :he
11th of next June, I will do it with the
feeling that I am assisting in the banging
of a man who is meeting a death that he
richly deserves.
"Hanging is too good for him," he con
tinue.:. "I could take him out on the
road, run a red-hot iron into his flesh and
hold it there until he fainted. 1 would
repeat it as soon as he regained conscious
ness, and keep it up until he died a death
of horrible agony. That is the way he
should be treated. Think of the fiendish

manner in which he murdered those
girls! Hanging is too good."
Theodore Durrant can look for little
pity from him.
The time is rapidly drawing near when .
Durrant must be conveyed to the death 13
chamber. Two guards will be detailed tc II
; watch him. Tney will eat and sleei *m
within sight and call of the murderer jr
The death chamber is situated on the top
floor of the building that once was used as
the furniture factory. To reach it one
climbs three long flights tf stairs, and is
confronted by an iron door which leads
into the chamber. There, in the middle
of a large room, is a caee in which the
condemned man will be confined.
'Adjoining the death chamber to the
;ou.li is the execution-room. The gallows
is in place, and from the death chamber to
the execution-room is but a iew steps.
The windows are painted while, and it is
here that Durrant must hang.
Warden Hale was seen at the prison to
day. He said ihe death watch would ba
put over Durrant six or eight days before
the date of execution. "He will be treated
like any other prisoner under sentence of
death. There will be no difference," said
the warden. . .
It is not thought that Durrant is break
ing down. That the anxiety and worry is
telling upon him can be seen in his
features, but as yet he has not shown the
slightest fear. He recognizes his position
fully, but the gleam of hope is not dead in
his breast. He expects something to turn
up to save him.

Shareholder* Seek Jtefunding of Taxe*
Paid by the Institution.
MODESTO, Cal., May 13.â This morn
ing J. E. Ward, cashier of the First Na
tional Bank of Modesto, served subpenaa
upon Supervisor G. W. Toombs, chairman
of tha board, in the tax cases of the bank.
There were fifteen subpenas served, each
shareholder of the bank commencing a
separate suit. The papers served are for
the tax of 1896, and the aggregate amount
is about^SOO. In a day or two subpenas
will be served for the tax collected for the
year 1895, amounting to $2000. In that
year the tax was doubled, as the County
Assessor claimed that t..e bank, not hav
ing paid its tax the year before, was sub
ject to double taxation. In the suit to be
instituted there will be seventeen plain
tiffs, as there were that number of share
holders of the bank's stock in 1895. Both
of the taxes were paid under protest and
the suits are brought for the return of the
money, since the Supreme Court of this
State has held that the tax is illegal. The
Dank made a demand for the return of the
money, but the Supervisors refused to re
turn the same, as it is their intention to
carry the case to the Supreme Court of the
United States.
Mr. Ward informed the Supervisors that
in the case of every other bank in the
State the tax had been returned since the
decision of the State Supreme Court claim
ing that the tax was illegal.
UETjAHAR CASE AT CARSOS.
Sensational Complication in the Inter
esting Mining Suit.
CARSON, Nev., May 13â To-day the
plaintiffs in the Deiamar case continued
to introduce evidence. Caiary, ex-sbiit
boss of the Deiamar, swore that there was
no mineral. in the Naiad Queen ground.
Patrick Bonner, the principal plaintiff,
took the stand and testified that the town
site was settled in May, 1894. When cross
examined by Judge RivÂ»s he was asked if
he had not made affidavit and filed it in
the Land Office in which he i. wore that
the townsite was laid out in 1692. When
this question was asked the witness threw
up his hand to the attorney and said:
"There is some mistake here. Judge;
there is some mistake." He then added
that if he had made such an affidavit it
was a mistake ; | his lawyer drew it up, and
he must hare signed it without knowing
what the date was.
' This admission caused quite a sensation
in court, as the Land Office affidavit placed
the site in April, 1892, only antedating
the location of the mine by two weeks,
while the change to 1894, admitted by the
plaintiff, made the mining location ante
date the townsite by two years. F. Swin
dler, for the defense, explained some maps
in a diagram. He will be on toe stand to
morrow to testify regarding the mineral
deposits.

â¢ .Mr. Berry's assailant, and subsequently
his victim, was William M. Hairnes of
Madera, who is also well known and
prominently connected here. His father
is Thomas E. Hughes, owner of the
Uaghes Hotel. Whiie they are rivals in
the hotel business of the city the fcesi cf

Sr. and Mr. Berry have always been iden

they were dubbed the "father and mother

The cause of to-day's difiiculty was due
to the excitability of young Huzbes and

BUR/ED GOLD ON A SATSOP RANCH
Bof a Rich Maniac Conducting a ;
Search for His Ward's

TACOMA. Wash., May 13.â George C.

days endeavoring to obtain some clew to .
the location of buried treasure amount ng '
to thousands of dollars, which belongs to
Jason Tccmpson, an inmate of the Steiia- j
coon: Asylum.
Thompson came to this country from
the North of Ireland when a boy, and is
cow 55 years old. Besides his Cheha'is
â¢'cunt? ra-caes he owns ten acres near
Puyaliuo. These tracts were pur
chased of the Northern Pacific Railroad.
and tfce last payments were made seven
years ago. Since that time he has made
much money in farming and mining, but.
being a bachelor and very eccentric and
ciose-hsted, he lived vary economically.
His friends, both at Pcjallsp and Satsop,
.believe he has in the neighoorbood of
â  $oGOQ hidden away somewhere. Most of
tnem think it is in the ground on his Sat
sop ranches, as he is known to have bees
distrustful of bants and had no confidant.
Morgan has inquired at the inks, both
in Pierce and Chenalis counties, and nnds
no record of any deposit;. He visited
Thompson at tne asylum, and, after a
brief talc, was recosnized by Thompson,
who declared he had spent his money for
land. Morgan is certain tuis is not so.
Thoiapson ess no relatives in this coun
try, and the physicians a' the asylum re

GuÂ»rdiin Morgan will make a thorough
search on the farms at Satsop for the
buried treasure.. His object is to obtain
money to pay "Thompson's expenses at
Stei'acoom, that his property need not be
sacrificed until ices are higher, the State
requiring payment when a patient has

McCAMISH'S CASE
GROWS DARKER
New and Strong Testi
mony Against the
Venturan.
The Startling Story Told by a
Prisoner Whose Name Is
Dennis.
Evidence That Shows the Accused
to Be a Most Ccwardly
Assassin.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 13.â
i preliminary examination of Deputy Con
stable Ed McCamisb, caarced with kill
ing Constable Pjie. was ended at New hill
this afternoon, the defendant being held
I for trial without bail. Some new and
strong evidence was introduced again
the accused and unless ail the testimony
is impeached on the trial in the Superior
Court McCamuh does not stand a ghost or
a show for hi* life.
Tne principal witness to-day was the
prisoner who was brought from the Voa
turajdii. He has been called Madison,
bat it is developed that his real name is
fohn Jj. Dennis. He was in the Venturm
jail service* short term for misdemeanor
when McCamish, saÂ«pected of tue murder,
was bronzht in.
A Call reporter who visited the jÂ»ii was
the first to teil McCamish about the dis
covery of the things that he nad claimed
were stolen, and the information greatly
agitated nim. Later McCamish talked
with Dennis and, so the witness said, con
fessed the crime in all its details and
asked for advice as to what he should do
to clear, himself. Dennis told him to
claim that a job was being put up on him,
and ilcCamish acted oa tae advice.
Unless Dean is is proved to be a colossal
liar, hi? evidence â will hang tne accused
man. for his story makes out the aeputy
constable to be a cowardly assassin. He
says McCaraisb teld him tba: he nad laid
plans to iavei?le Pyle to the station and
tnen shot him while he lay asieep, as he
had been wanting for some time to get
Py;e out ti the way.
McCamish. told nim that he hsd been
for a year past intimate with Pyle's wife,
and that the latter about six months be
fore hai contemplated poisoning her hus
band. McCamian had not expressed to
his feilow-prisoner any regret for his act,
but sail he might have hai the job done
fur $100 and taken no risk.
Sheriff Barr is inclined to Delieve the
story of the Ventura jail prisoner, who. it ia
said, was never convicted of anything more
serious than misdemeanor, he having a
mania for whipping Chinamen.
Tae defense made oruya feeole showing,
and will depend on impeaching the wit
nesses at the trial.

SAUSALITO'S FIGHT
AGAINST POOLMEN
Gambling Houses Will
Be Opened Next
Monday.
Schwartz Finds That Other
Pollroom Sellers Have
Frozen Him Out
Board of Town Trustees Meats the
Same Night the Resorts
Bud Forth.
SAFSALITO, Cal., May 13.â There may
be a merry war waged between the pooi
men, who start op in Sausalito neit Mon
day. Certain firms hare attempted to
gobble up all the rentable places in town,
in order to conduct their business without
opposition. To-day wnen H. Schwartz
came to town to rent a haii or room in
which he might also conduct the business
of pool-selling on Eastern races be found
to his surprise that notuing was to be had.
He tramped over the town in a vain
search, and at last learned that Harrison
& Co., Abrams and other pooimen had got
in a bead of him and secured leases of the
different places. Failing to find a place
where he can open up he intends to rent a
lot and erect a building.
Money seems to be plentiful with the
gamblers and they have spent it freely.
not omy in renting costly placet, but in
building additions and making other im
provements.
Yesterday Chris Buckley, the famous
politician, was in town with his nephew,
"Biliy" Harrison, who hasren-ed a por
tion of the Buffalo Hotel on Water street
for the purpose of running a "commission
business.
To-day the electric batteries are being
wasted out and made ready and tele
graph wires are being run from one end of
the town to the otner and connections
made Â»ith the offices of the poolrooms.
Preparations for z he opening of the pool
rooms on a much more extensive scale than
heretofore attempted have almost been
completed. The paraphernalia cave been
repainted and many new improvements
are seen. The opening of the poolrooms
lor business will take piace next Monday
and it is a significant fact tbat on the
same evening the Board of Town Trustees
will meet. The citiieni residing on the
hill are snowing their ooposition to the
presence of the gamblers in the town, and
oa the boats anu street corners the subject
is being discussed from all points of
view.
The ordinance passed by :he Town
Tru-tees last year forbidding tne selling
ct pools on horseraces is still in force, and
Recorder Joseph H. Pryor said tc-day
tbat unless it i* repeaied the same fight
that was waged against the gamblers last
-ummer would be prosecuted this
year. It is the intention of tne pool
men in case of arrest to de
mand jury trials and by obtaining dis
agreements on account of the divided
feeling existing among the people of the
town to be able to conduct their opera
tions until the season is OTer. However,
on account of the trouble croppine out
among themselves and the opposition of
the hiil people, there are iiveiy times
ahead, and Sausalito may be the scene o
much trouble and contention this sum
mer.

LOS ANGELES ALIVE
WITH CONDUCTORS
The City Full and Two
Trains Are Still to
Come.
No. 999, the Record-Breaker,
Due With New York's
Delegation.
A Day Is Spent In Sight-Seeing
Before Getting Down to
Business.
LOS ANGELES, C.v.., May 13,-As
fuil as the city seems to be witb con
ductors and their companions there are
yet two trainioads of them to arrive. The
special train of Wagner cars bearing the
.New York Central delegates and the
irain of Pullmans with the conductors
from the Pennsylvania lines will not ar
rive until to-morrow, both having been
â¢idetracked on the way hither on account
of ft washout. The passengers on these
trains will be somewhat late to enjoy the
fun. but the delegates to the convention
of the Order of Railway Conductors will
be in time to vote for officers at the Satur
day election. With the Pennsylvania and
New York parties will come a number of
the most prominent members of the
order, tome of them having long ago been
promoted to higher positions, but yet re
taining their membership.
It is stated that the New York train is
drawn by tho famous engine "No. 909,"
which made the great record of II- 1
miles on her division between New Yori
and Chicago. There are six Wagner cars
on tbis excursion, carrying more than "JOO
conductors. The time-table, however,
was made up from Eastern fexperience
and by those who never pulled a train
over the big divide. Railroad men here
in California will not be surprised if the
2%'ew York special comes into the conven
tion when tne convention is nearly over.
The otticers in charge of this train are :
J. D. Suults, manager; S. L. Carpenter,
secretary and treasurer; executive com
mitteeâF. D. Ware, D. Barrett, J. D.
Shults, S. L. Carpenter, J. Foiey and W.
E. Kelley.
To-day the conductors were conducted.
A train of fourteen coaches, loaded with
11400 of the visitors, went to Pasadena and
me ostrich farm, where the strangers
were hospitably treated and had a great
lime. As great as the crowd was it did.
not include all the pleasure-seekers, for
smaller parties visited otner places of in
terest. To-morrow the people will co to
Santa Monica and Catahna. Tne ball in
the evening will end the Friday pro
gramme. It is expected that fuliy 6000
paople will be present on ihis occasion,
when everything, including supper, is to
be free. Tne Atlanta train, wnich, tc
cording to its itinerary, was to have
started homeward on Saturday, will not
not go until Monday on account of the
delay in conducting tne business sessions.
The meeting of the Grand Division did
not transact much business, much of the
work being purposely delayed until the
other delegations arrive to-morrow. A
number of reports from various commit
tees were submitted. The report of the
committees on jurisprudence and on
grievances were turned in, but will not be
given any publicity. The reports of the
grievance committee will not be acted
upon by the Grand Division until ail of
the delegates are here. TU6re would be a
contest for the offices to be filled by the
election Saturday but for the fact tnat it
is the policy of the order to keep in their
places the high executive officers so lonE
as they do their duty acceptably. The
order's chief omcer receives a salary of
$5000 a year and a number of otner im
portant officers receive $3000 annually.
Elections are usually a matter of form.
There are not multitudes of office-seekers
at every corner; instead, a large number
of loyal men and women working steadily
for the universal brotherhood of man
kind.
The Ladies' Auxiliary held another
business meeting io-day, when more ad
dresses and reports from various divisions
were the principal features.
MEXICAN ASSASSINS.
They Have a New Trial for Bloodthirsty
Crimes Committed Several
Years Ago.
SANTA FE, N. Mex., May 13.â A special
term of the District Court opened to-day
at the county seat of Mora County for the
trial of the accused assassins of ex-Sheriff
John Dougherty and others in 1893.
Dougherty headed what was called the
Dougherty faction of the Democratic
party. The other faction was led by
Agapito Abeytia. While Dougherty sat near
a window in his home one night in Decem
ber, 1893, with a child on each knee, he
was shot and killed. Ten weeks later an
Indian, Juan Rael, was killed by the
Sheriff's posse. Agapito Abeytia, then
Sheriff, was alleged to be the organizer of
th? conspiracy to remove his political op
ponent, Dougherty. The alleged con
spirators hat au associate, the Indian
Rael.
When public sentiment demanded an
investigation Abeytia is said to have
called several conferences of bis associates
and decided to sacrifice Rael by charging
him with Dougherty's death. According
to one of the alleged conspirators, Estan
islau Sandoval was ordered by the Sheriff
to tile a formal accusation against Rael,
and the posse went after him having or
iiers, it is said, not to bring him in olive.
Kael was enticed trotn his house and shot.
Detective Thornton, who was put on the
case a year Jater, unearthed a startling
siring of facts. Ei^iit of the suspected
conspirator*, including Sheriff Abeytia,
whom the Governor had removed from
offic*, v.ere arrested. Three of them
turned Slate's evidence. They made a
full confession to the effect that Victor
Lujan had been paid $20' joy Abeytia to
kill Dougherty, and E.ael, who knew of
the transaction, was killed for fear he
would turn informer. Sastenos Lucero
and Juan B. Romero, jailers, who. with B.
Cordova, comprised the Sheriff's posse
that killed Rael, were tried in 1894, found
guilty and sentenced to l'fe imprison
ment, but on appeal the case was reversed
and tne prisoners remanded for a new
trial, which began to-day.
WOMEN MEET AT STOCKTON.
i
Large Attendance at the Opening Session
of the Convention â The Speakers
ana' Their Tcpxs.
STOCKTON, Cal., May 13.- There was
quite a large attendance of ladies and a
lew of thd sterner sex at the Avon The
ater this morning at the convention ol the
Woman's Congress. The stage of the
theater was profusely and tastefully
decorated with flowers and potted plams,
and the chairs on the stage were occu
pied by the ladies of the congress and
friends of t:;e movement for the advance
ment of woman.
The Woman's Congress was called to
order this forenoon at the Avon Theater
at 10:30 o'clock by Mrs. John F. Swift.
Toe iady said mat they were not aware
until teaching Stockton that tftaj were to
have a morning session, and consequently
they were not as well prepared as they
wonia like to be.
Rev. Daniel G. Mackinnon then opened
the congress with a short prayer, after
which Miss M. A. Adams read a paper on
"The Education of Children," ihe burden
of which was that from each and every
one should be exacted a pledge to the
effect that in view of the fact that the
Slate furnished the means of education
thÂ«> attendants at the school should be
willing to promise that they would so
improve the advantages offered as to be
come useful citizens ot the common
wealth.
A recess was then taken to 8 o'clock this
afternoon, when tlie following programme
was presented: "Unconscious Tuition,"
Miss Mary Donnelly; "Education for En
joyment or Culture," Professor Ross,
Stanford University; "The Main Strength
of the Species,' Miss Ray Frank.
The programme for this evening was as
follows: "Public School Education a
Loan, Not a Gift," MisÂ» Mary Ne wherry
Adams; ''Heredity," Mrs. Helen Gar
dener.
MRS. LANGTRY GETS A DIVORCE.
The Famous Society Beany Granted a Di
cree by Judge Crump at Lake
port.
LAKEPORT, Cal., May 13.â The cele
brated divorce case of Langtry vs. Lang
try came on rather unexpectedly for trial
to-day in the absence of both parties.
The plaintiff, Mrs. Langtry, had expected
to be present, but being detained by im
portant business engagements in Europe,
directed her attorney to proceed in her
absence.
The complaint was upon two of the
statutory grounds, desertion and failure
to provide. Summons was served upon
the defendant personally in England
more than a year ago, and bis default for
not answering was duly entered some time
since.
H. C. McPike of the firm of Dunne A
McPike of San Francisco appeared for the
plaintiff. Mr. McPike stated to the court
that as Mrs. Langtry was able to provide
for herself the case would be tried on the
ground of desertion.
The depositions of several witnesses
taken in London, Eng., were read, docu
mentary evidence was introduced and wit
nesses were examined orally.
Judge Crump took the matter under ad
visement and after careful examination of
the papers and evidence in the case pave
judgment for the plaintiff. He tound all
the proceedings regular and that the evi
dence clearly entitles the plaintiff to the
decree prayed for.
The judgment awards Mrs. Langtry the
custody of their only child, a daughter,
and all her property in Lake County. It
appears from the testimony that Langtry
aeserted bis wife more than liiteon
years ago and that he had since conn
bated nothing toward her support. Mrs.
Langtry in her deposition declares Lake
County to be her residence and it appears
from her testimony that her wardrobe,
heirlooms and other personal effects have
been in Lake County for more than ten
years.
NOT MUCH OF A HERO.
The Oretown (Or.) Fosimasier Who Sworn
Jcy Rivers to Surrender Himself Is
a Thief After All.
PORTLAND, Or., May 13.â 1t would
I appear that Vincent Button, ex-Postmas
ter of Oretown, Tillamoofc County, Or.,
now under indictment on ten different
counts of malfeasance in office, is not
quite the hero and honorable individual
he hai been represented to be and pictured
in the daily press. It was he who during
the severe storms of last winter, when ac
cused of a small shortage in his accounts,
risked his life in swollen ntreams and al
most impassable mountain roads to pre
sent himself before United States Judge
Bellinger, unaccompanied by an officer.
To the contrary, the evidence developed
in Mr. Sutton's case since the discharge of
the United States Grand Jury has taken
the seal of secrecy from the lips of Gov
ernment officials goes to show that fcfutton
was a methodical purloiner of moneys
coming into the postorh'ce he was in charge
of. In fact, not satisfied with taking what
the meager r?ceipts of the Oretown office
wouid allow, he proceeded to develop the
business of the office by false returns of
stamp cancellation until he had reached
the necessary sale of $200 in stamps to
make it a money-order postoffice. And
this object having been gained, he did
nothing e!se than appropriate every dol
lar intrusted to him.
THE NEW UNITED STATES CONSUL TO AMOY.
A. B. Johnson of Grand Junction, Colo., the newly appointed United States
Consul to Amoy, China, arrived at the Russ a few days ago with his wife and
young son and daughter. Mr. Johnson was secretary during the last campaign of
the Republican State Central Committee of Colorado. Though educated for the
bar, be has practiced but little, but has given his tima to newspaper work and
latterly to the pro wine of fruit. He was at one time editor and part owner of the
Gnnnison Daily Review-Press. Afterward he was editor ana part proprietor of the
Daily Commercial at O^den, Utah. This was during the last great growth of
Ogden. When he was in Gunnison it was an active mining town.
Mr. Johnson received his appointment directly through the influence of Sena
tor Wolcoit. He was first appointed Consul to Fuchan, but this was afterward
changed to Amoy, a much more lucrative place. This position pays $3500 a year,
besides fees. As it is an important commercial point the appointment may be re
garded as a good one.
"More than 1000 foreign ships a year put into the harbor of Amoy," said Con
anl Jobnson, "and the business done is very large. Besides this, it is a
much pleasanter place to be stationed than many others in China. There is quite
a European and American population, as San Francisco people are aware. Of
these there is a liberal sprinkling of missionaries.
"I expected to sail for Amoy from Vancouver on one of the Empress steamers,
and bad goi my transportation 10 Vancouver, when the department wired me to
change my route by way of ISan Francisco, and consult with Collector Wise at the
Custom-house in regard to some of the matters with xhich 1 will hare to deal."

and decidedly painful experience a few
days ago. He says be bas been badly
treated at a time be was seriously in

thorougb legal examination into the
whole matter. This is his story: "On
Friday, May 7, I was employed by J. F.

teen-foot ladder I fell and was made in
sensible. At length some one gnve me
some stiraulan t â what it was I do not

SIGMA aIQI&A FRVI.-irS.
Stanford Spectator* Hitntst the Initia
tion of Arw Members.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cat*, May
13.â The yearly initiation of new members
in the Sigma Sigma Fraternity took place
to-day. As usual the public part of the
initiation was greatly enjoyed by the
spectators. Early in tte morning the
newly made members of the fraternity
marched up to the quadrangle in single
tile. All carried a dress-suit case and
were to all appearances ready for some
swell entertainment. Having received
orders they retired to a private room and
soon emerged in the grotesque costumes
which formed part of me initiation
exercises. < :
"Johnnie" Brunton '99, dressed as a
tough newsboy, with a soiled polo cap
perched jauntily on one side of his head,
sold paper?. Gregory '99 represented a
smutty-faced barkeeper, such as one runs
across in reading any old English tale.
He dispensed soda at 5 cents a glass and
did a rushing business. "Cupid" Carhart
'99, wearing a shockingly short dress and
for headgear a lace bonnet, made a typical
old-fashioned milkmaid. He was easily
embarrassed, however, and seemed ill at
ease whenever pointed out by his young
lady friends.
Southerland '93 spent his time in the
first place entertaining the ladies, a;
thouzh he entertained the crowd inci
dentally. His costume was a dress suit
and a happy smile. Some of those initi
ated paraded with broomsticks, whiie
others blacked the snoes of the multitude
or busied themselves sweeping the asphalt
pavement of the quadrangle.
Having spent the day as ordered by the
installed members of the fraternity, the
students were declared full-fledged mem
bers of the select Sigma Sigma organiza
tion.
The Press Club of Stanford held a ban
quet in tne Cardinal Cafe at Palo Alto
tnis evening. Tonsts were offered and the
twelve members spent a pleasant evening.
The civil engineers held their annual
baiiquet In me Sigma Nu House this
evening. About twenty members were
present, including the faculty members of
the club. It bordered on midnight when
the meeting was adjourned.
UNDERMINED BY TEREDOS.
Partial Cof/cpse of a Fine N;w Sawmill,
With Pie Foundations, at
Oid Tacoma.
TACOMA, Wash., May 13.â Over a
quarter of the fine new sawmill erected by
Lillis Bros, last year at Oid Tacoma sunk
four feet on its foundations to-day and
the entire mill is liable to falL into the
sound. It is built over the water on piling.
Thirty piles supporting the outer tifty
feet collapsed this morning, having been
destroyed by teredo?. The piles farther
back are similarly weakened. These sup
port an expensive plant of machinery,
which is being taken out for fear it will
fall in. It is claimed that the foundations
were entirely too weak for so heavy a
building and that experienced builders
would not nave driven green piles with
neither bark nor ariiticial coating on to
protect them from the teiedos.
Tiie mill was started a year ago by J. C.
Lillis and ex-Fire Chief H. M. Lillis. who
had financial assistance from their brother,
B. Lillis of San Francisco. It had a ca
pacity of 550,000 feet per day, but has been
operated only a few days in January,
when lumber was cut to orect the mill
buildings. The plant cost between $20,000
and $25,000. A first-class machinery plant
was put in by J. O. Bradney, a local man
ufacturer of engines, to whom it was
turned back to-day as bis claims had not
been entirely settled. Either new founda
tions will be put in or a new mill erected
on an adjoining site.
A PORTLAND PARANOIAC.
Stella May Flannery, Formerly of This
City, Committed io the Salem
Insane Asylum.
PORTLAND, Or., May 13.â A commis
sion in lunacy yesterday committed to the
Salem Insane Asylum Stella May Flan
nery, aged 21 years, afflicted with, what
Dr. D. H. Raud calls "paranoiac." One
of her unaccountable ideas is that if she
kills it is not a crime. It is doing the
world a iavor. However, for all her
threats Â»nd her well-laid plans, her ideas
of killing exist only in her imagination.
Ihe persons included in her fatal ban
were a numder of Portland and Omaha
railroad officials, a few Portland doctors,
a couple of women and a Congressman or
two.
Miss Flannery seems to have become
imbued with the art of cajoling and
threatening people into doing something
for her. She is one of tne great nuisances
of the age â the begging letter writer â and
by her remarkably invented stories she
has brought.the wrath of Congressmen
down on the heads of ihe Union Pacific
people.
She came here from San Francisco last
fall, where she pretended to know all
prominent people, from the Governor
of the State to the Mayor of San Fran
cisco, bhe exhibited signatures to letters,
but not the contents of them, showing
that she had enjoyed what is commonly
known as an "oflic al pull."
She asked Superintendent Baxter of
Union Pacific for employment, and, he
having none for her. Miss Flannery wrote
the most infamous letters to the Union
Pacific headquarters, raising quite a
rumpus for a time. Her various stories
are tne strangest ever listened to, and,
despite her insanity, she is very plaus
ibie. The commission, in making its re
port, stated tnat her malady is incurable
and that she is too dangerous to be at
large.
HO "RT7&BISG" AT STAFFORD.
lhe Class of 1000 Takes Decisive Action
.ignintt the Practice.
STANFORD UNIVERBITY, Cal., May
13. â The freshman class met in the chapel
this afternoon to discuss whether or not
"rushing" would be tolerated in the future
at Stanford.
The class was in a position to stop this
custom at Stanford, which, although de
clining in Eastern universities, has been
carried on from year to year with great
fierceness at both Stanford and Berkeley.
In a hard-fought contest last semester the
freshmen managed to tie up the sopho
mores- With this condition of affairs the
class could gracefully withdraw, as no
charge of cowardice would stand against
them.
The faculty was especially interested in
seeing the class take this course of action.
They greatly preferred seeing inter-class
contests on the diamond and sridiron de
cide class championships rather than a
hard-fought "rush" attended with more
or less chances of accidents.
The class, alter a few unimportant pre
liminaries, adopted the following set of
resolutions:
Whekeas, The experiences of our class In the
"rush" in which we were engaged in the fall
of 1896 somewhat corroborated such a view
of the matter; and whereas tho question of a
"rush" or not having a "rush" depends almost
entirely on the attitude 01 the sophomore
class, which will be our standing at the close
of this college year; and whereas the class of
1900 of Leland Stanford Jr. University
has been thiough the experiences of one
"rush," in which it came out victorious; and
whereas the custom of "rushing," alihough
in vogue In some of the leading colleges of
this country, seems to us unbecoming to and
not in keeping with the spirit and aims of
this institution, therefore be it
Resolved, By the class of 1900 oi Leland Stan
ford Jr. University, assembled in spsciat meet-
Ing lor the consideration of mis problem, that
we heartily declare it to be our desire to ab
stain from engaging In any "rush" with the
class oÂ£ 1901 at any time during our college
course, and thai we will not alscournge the
growth of a sentiment against "rushing" in
our university.
The meeting then adjourned.
Saltzmnn Loirs His Suit for Damarjes.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 13â The damage

WIRES WILL BE
PUT UNDERGROUND
An Important Conference
at the City Hall
Yesterday.
Corporations Are Willing to
Meet the Municipality
Half Way.
An Expert Will Be Appointed to
Draw Up Plans and Submit Them
to the Supervisors
As the result of a conference held yes
terday afternoon in the committee- room
of the Board of Supervisors it is probable
that within a comparatively short time
all of the electric light, telephone, tele
graph and power wires in the business
portion of the City will be laid in con*
duits.
There were present Mayor Phelsn, Su
pervisors Devauy, Britt, Sheeban and
Rivers, representatives of the telegraph,
light and power companies, fire alarm and
police telegraph, Merchants' Association,
Superintendent of Streets and Fire De
partment.
Mayor Phelan, who called the confer
nce, stated that its object was to do
away with overhead electric wires so that
the City might be beautified and the Fire
Department less hampered in its efforts
to subdue fires in districts where the wires
are numerous and large interests are at
stake. He called for suggestions from
those present as to the beat means to at
tain the desired end.
T 'je representatives of the various com
panies expressed an entire willingness to
meet the City half way in its efforts to put
the wires underground if given a suffi
cient time to arrange the matter satisfac
torily to themselves. They stated that it
was their present policy to get the wires
into conduits as rapidly as circumstances
would permit.
Nathan Dohrmann, representing the
Merchants' Association, suggested* that
the conduit should be built by the City
and a rental charged the corporations
using it. He thought tiiat a handsome
revenue could be derived from such a plan,
and that the companies would be satisfied.
They were not, however, claiming that
such a scheme had been tried in the East
and in Europe and bad proved a failure.
Mayor Phelan ttien suggested that an
expert be appointed to look into the mat
ter and draw a plan to be followed. He
asked the representatives of the companies
if they would be satisfied with a year's
time in which to place their wires under
ground.
The telephone and telegraph companies
were satisfied with a year, but the power
companies were not sure that they could
arrange to change their wires within thai
period.
It was finally decided to appoint an ex
pert to draw the plans anrl in the mean
time call upon the companies for written
propositions as to the length of time they
would require and the advantages desired.
Superintendent JHewett of the Fire
Alarm and Police Telegraph was sug
gested as the expert to prepare the conduit
plan and the electric. men expressed them
selves as satisfied with him, but no ap
pointment was made.
HOLIDAYS THE WORLD OVEB.
In l.rit in- A nieric <n Countries the People
Work Only 200 DayÂ« in the Year.
A computation made a short time apo
showed that among European countries
the two in which wages were highest and
the hours of labor least were England and
France, whereas the two countries in
which wapes were smallest and the
hours of labor longest were in Italy and
Russia. In ecme countries of the
world an explanation of the apparent
dearth of progressive industry among
the inhabitants is to be found,
perhaps, in the recurrence of holidays
of a religious, patriotic or purely social
character, and many persons who are
familiar with the industrial usages
in some cities of South and Central Amer
ica say that there the number of holidays
seems to exceed the number of working
days. There are in such countries usually
not fewer than a dozen church festivals,
and there are besides patriotic festivals.
A similar state of affairs exists in all Latin
countries, and is to be found in the
United States, too, when one turns to the
legal festivals of Louisiana. There is the
holidcy of January 9, commemorating the
battle of New Orleans; the Mardi Gras, on
March 2, in N*w Orleans; Confederate
Memorial day, in April; Good Friday, All
Saints' day, election day, Louisiana Labor
day, on November 25, and Thanksgiving
and Christmas days.

ferson Davis, Texas the anniversary of the
battle of San Jacinto, and Alabama the

It makes health in the right way. It works
according to the right theory, and in 30
years of practice, it has proved that the
theory is absolutely correct. It begins at
the beginning by putting the stom-
ach, liver and bowels into perfect order, but
it begins its good work on the blood before
it finishes with the digestive system. It
searches out disease germs wherever they
may be and forces them out of the body.
It promotes the copious secretion of the
digestive fluids, and assists in throwing off
refuse matter. It makes the appetite good
and the digestion strong. It isn't a violent
medicine. It isn't strong medicine. It
does nothing but good to every portion of
the body. It doesn't do harm in one place
while it Is helping another place. It is
meant to help the whole body and it does
help it. Whenever a man feels himself fail-

that he is losing flesh, he should waste no

days be subtracted from the total number
of days in a year there are lefc 313, and if
one-third or the other days available lor

is perfectly clear why there should not be
more than 200 working days in a year.
In Anglo-Saxon countries and in the

A gentleman long connected with the artistic advertising department of the Youth*
Companion, Boston, relates that he had hi* attention called to
RIPAN-5 TABILES
by a business acquaintance who expressed a high opinion of them. He had been a
good deal troubled with what he described as a nervous, bilious condition that ap-
peared to be brought on from time to time by high pressure work or special mental
activity or excitement, such as would be common at periods of unusual nervous ten-
sion. It became his practice at such times to take a Tabule â just one â at the mo-
ment that he observed the difficulty approaching. It made no difference when. A
favorable result was invariably apparent within twenty minutes. The only notice-
able effect wax that he always felt all right in twenty minutes if he took the Tabule :
while if he did not, the nervous, uncomfortable feeline intensified and led to a bad
afternoon and tired evening. He now carries them with him all the time, but doesn't
have occasion to apply to them anything like as often as he did at first. Nowadays
there are frequent periods of from a week to ten days, or even two weeks, during
which he finds that he has no occasion whatever to make use of the Tabuies, but
still carries them in his pocket just the same, so that they may be ready if an occa-
sion occurs.

a substitute for indiarubber may
be made from the gum of a tree indigenous
â 
tea syndicate bas closed a
- ..;ise of the inventor's
- a xargc sum and a perietua.
The substitute has been found to pos
sess many of the properties of pure rub
ber, but it can be manufactured for a
small sum.
The invention of a process dt -whicn a
substitute for indiarubber can be rn^de
at f. low cost will please the commercial
world, because the increased use of
caoutchouc by modern manufacturers has
threatened a famine in the market.
The new substitute for rubber comes
from a tree which grows abundantly in
California, particularly in Sonoma Concty.
The company that has bough: the rigat
intends to establish a factory here at an
early date.
The new substance resembles vegetable
glue, and it can be made in .a: ; -c quanti
ties on short notice. Speaking of the mat
ter yesterday. Mr. Falconer said:
"The gam is procured from a trans
verse incision in the large root. Under
this incision a hoie is scooted in the earth
in which a leaf is lolied like a cup, or else
a tin ve??e. i* placed, into which the thin
and neariy co!or!es3 juice runs. The juice
flows rapidly for the first ten to fifteen
rrinu:es, and after two or three days' ex
. posure to the air and sunlight a layer of
gum is formed over the juice whicn is
then removed and the crust or layer or
gum gradually re-forms.
"The flow of gum is greatest in tie
spring and summer months. From 50
to ICO pounds can easily be gathered each
day by one man. For every pound of juice
one ounce of a secret composition or solu
tion is added for the purpose of 'curing'
and Â«a?:e- the process of oxygena
tion. Tee juice has been found to contain
in 100 parts 12.5 hydrogen and 57.5 carbon,
the specific gravity being 0.95. The crust
that forms over the juice consists of an
insoluble base with minute pores contain
ing the soluble parts, which resemble
otner vegetable glues.
- "It will vulcanize readily. Vulcaniza
tion is the process of imparting new prop
erties to rubber by causing it to combine
witn sulphur through the agency of a
hizh temperature. Without vulcaniza
tion the manufacture of ruboer into
durable and useful articles of commerce
would be impossible. Suiphur gives
greater elasticity to rubber, and wnen
seated is pressed into molds or pressed
with neavr rollers. This substance can
be produced in any quantity."
WRESTLED FOR BLOOD.
Dan McLeod of the Olympic
Cub Was Dsfeatei by
Farmer Barns.
0:- cf the Greatest Contests Ever
Hld in he United
States.
Possibly the most exciting wrestling
ds;cÂ£ that ha* taken piace in this coun
try m cany years was decided last Thurs
day evening in Davenport, lowa. The
contestants were Dan McLeod, formerly
c! the Olympic Club of this City, and
"Farmer Burns," the champion wrestler
of the world, who was managed by Dan
can McMillan, an athlete who is also well
known by the sports of this City. The
following is a description of the great
contest:
In the first bout the opening wu very cau
tious. Burns acted upon the defensive from
the start, winniug apoiause by successive
.breaks from several d at gero as holds secured
by :ise CaiUomian. The Scotchman was the
aggressor, and after, a bad mix up in Tain to
do soae effective work wi-.ai a leg hold Mc-
Leod was planted as solid as a. roefc â when
Barns landed on top, a:: the efforts of thÂ«
champion to turn Â£1121 over drew lauzhter
irom the spectators.
Alter two attempt he gave It up and con
fined himself to meetinc the vicious attacks
of the California:!, who came at him like a
whirlwind. Barns' agility enabled him to
escape from some very dubious positions.
Twice Burns was forced off the mat into the
crowd, where they were separated by the ref
eree. ..'â _â  Â£â 
Although It had been agreed that the men
should return to the mat whenever the? got
off the referee's interference, seemed to have
aroused McLeod's wrath, and casting a wither
ing look at the Voline umpire, he went after
the Farcer in a manner which proved lha: ho
lost his temper. La the whirlwind McLeod
secured a hold which gave him the leverage
lor a hal.'-X and cross or hammer-lock
with which he forced Barns' shoulders to the
ma: after 27 minutes of splendid work.
A rest of about fifteen minute* brought the
principals smiling into the padded arena for
the second trial at strength. In this bout
Burns developed offensive tactic*. He was on
the aggressive ani the work was lively. After
about ten minutes of splendid wrestling, in
terrupted by volcanic applause of the specta
tors at close intervals, the husky Big Bock
farmer secured the same hold which toe Cali
fornian had made such effective use of in the
first bout. For a time the movements of the
men were bewildering in their Ughtnlng-lifca
rapidity, and McLeod's strength and agility
not only facilitate-! hi 3 escape from some very
critical positions, bat also enabled. him for
some few momenta to assume the offensive.
However after thirteen minutes of hard work
:he half-Kelson and harsinerlock hold secured
by Burn* forced McLeod's shoulders fairly and
squarely to the mat, making honors even and
a centra all the Interest upon the last
The third and last bout was the fiercest of
the three, and in It the wonderful recupera
tive powers of the champion were shown to
pe'iection. After several minutes of prelimi
nary work the Farmer went at his man like a
tiger. He lif ed him clear off the floor and
landed Mm on the mat with a side throw
which narrowly escaped beinz a victory. Mc-
Leod's tactics were 01 a desperate character.
wnile he cut Barns' left eye in the second
bout Em an accidental blow with either his
elbow or hand, he unintentionally, no doubt,
aggravated the injury in the . third bout by a
sudden oppÂ«rcut of the head, which struck
the Farmer squarely between the eyes.
â : The latter was soon bleeding copiously from
a gash directly under the left eye, as well as
from the nostrils and a gash over the bridge
oi the nose. This seemed thoroughly to
arouse the phlegmatic champion, and the
â¢ tyle -. which he plowed up the mat with the
Californian was a caution. McLeod very
dexterously slipped ont of some very ticklish
positions, narrowly shuffling off some very
fatal holds. The wearisome work of getting
away from the champion was too much for the
Californian, and it left him exhausted and in
no condition to resist the Farmer's final
onslaught. fcxfc'iSSg
For three minutes there was as fierce a
struggle as the history cX the mat ever fur-
nisned. Finally the Scott County athlete se
cured a neck hold with which he set McLeod
a-^oing and brought Ms shoulders to the mat
witn a side roll very dexterously executed,
gettirg the last and the second fall, winning
the last in jost twelve minutes. Burns was
the popular favorite, and the specUters went
wild with joy.
After McLeod had recovered somewhat from
the daze in which his final defeat had
plunged him h^ made a statement to the ef
fect tn.-. : the referee had been unfair, and his
backer. J. H. MeCormici, announced his will
ingness to back McLeod in & match with
Burns for any part of $10,000, providing
George Slier "or some other fair man" was
the referee. These defiant speeches were not
very courteously received by the audience. -,

HOOHLUM BEENSAS.
He Will Ask the Sopreme Court for a
NÂ»w Trial.
Attorney Edwin L. Forster and Kicbard
Gibson have riled a Dili of exc?ptions on
the part of Nicholas Brennan, who was
recently convicted of extorting money.
and who is now serving a sentence of
three years in a felon's cell in the Sate
prison at San Quentin. His victim was
the late Theresa Tarpey, a girl under 13
years of age, who was dragged by him to |
the lowest depths cf degradation.
The trial of Brennan disclosed a con
dition of depravity in this City that, if
presented in a work ot fiction, would have j
evoked an indignant protest by the en
tire community. Three complaints were
made against Brennan, and on the pre- !
liminary hearing in the Police Court it j
was stipulated by Brennan's lawyer that j
the testimony teen taken should apply to
all three cases. ,
When the case of extortion came for
hearing in the Superior Court an effort
was made by Attorney Forster to shut
out tee tran-cript sent up from the Police j
Court, tut Judge Wallace held that under
the stipulation it was admissible, and the
jury promptly returned a verdict 0/ guilty
against Brennan. a typical hoodlum, who j
seemed to be proud of his prominence as
a criminal pervert.
Brennan'a lawyers say that the court ;
erred in denying the motion to dismiss i
the information lor felony because the de
fendant was not put on trial within the j
time prescribed by the statute, and for al
leged technical defects in the pleadings j
and proceedings.
On account, of these alleged errors the :
Supreme Court will be asked to remove j
the State- prison stripes from JfcSrennan |
long enough to enable him to have a new
trial. -;>,:: .'.y/^J'-i-^lv

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 14, 1897.
GOT A FORTUNE
IN FEATHERS
Return of Four Adventur
ous Nimrods Frcm the
Swamp of Chiapas.
Found Huge Tapirs in the Wilds
Nearly as B g as a
Cow.
Battle fcr LiX Wth a Vicious Alliga
torâ Queer Island Nesting Place
of Egrets.
Four hunters who nave ai remarkable,
| and to anybcdy but who has equal skill
â¢ with guns,highly dangerous experiences in
Cirapas, away at the taii end of Mexico,
area: the International HoteL Tney are
J. E. Gar ick, who has teon a hunter m
California and "all ovei" for more than
twenty years; H. R. and C. H. Freer of
Biker-field, younger men, but who have
'hunted since early boyhood, Jand E. J.
Crabtree, who, like the others, has Â»ll
bis life been familiar with gun and trap.
These nimrods went othatremoteconn
try to hunt egrets for t eir leathers. They
were so successful a:ter a five months'
sieee that the? have returned here with a
little over fif:een founds of feathers, and
theÂ°e being worth far more than their
weight in go!d the hunters have made in
this shcrt time a comfortable little for
tune.
In going to Chiapas, the southwestern
border of which is on the Gulf of Tehuan
tepec, and ths country itself reaching
2 most to Yucatan, they found a region
tilled with egrets and other beautiful
wild fowl. They also found great tapirs
in abundance, two kinds of tigers, both of
the latter oeinz beautifully mottled, and
a huge bird bigger than a turkey, but
witn a crest, and with meat as sweet as
that of the pheasant. There were many
other birds, a larze number of which had
the most exquisite plumage. Besides
these cnere were marauding animals, not
the leaÂ«t dangerous of which were the
alligators, which in large nuacers infest
that country.
Th ; s was found a virgin field for the
nimrods, for no while men, so they re
count, had ever before been in that part
of the country. Besides the feathers, the
tiger skins and the curios which the ex
plorers brought from their incursion into
the wilderness, are the breasts and crests
of different birds. The colors are exceed
ingly brilliant, and the feathers se. fine
and sort that they seem identical with the
finest fur.
In any book of reference regarding the
region which they visited mar be found
something like this: "Cbiapa?, the most
southern State of Mexico. The highlands
nave an a^reeaoie climate, bat ttie low*
lands are hot and sickly.' 1
It was thus that the four hunters found
it They deem it very strange that they
escared from that hot, swampy and fetid
country witbout fever.
"I regard it as most fortunate," said
Mr. Freer last night, "that none of us
were at any time sick. The country ia
very swampy and overrun with alligator?.
Why, aiong one lake we visited the ex
crement piled up six inches thick,
and when we walked in it it was like step
ping on sawdust. The atmosphere was
fetid, and it is a wonder we escaped the
effects of it We landed at Ban Benito,
the last port in Mexico, and from there
went to Tapacau a, a town with 9000 in
habitants, twenty-two miles away. There
we made our boats, and then conveyed
them and our bageage in oxcarts to Masa
tan, where we embarked in a river and
finally be?an our hunt for the egrets.
"The range of our hunting was orer a
distance oi sixty miles, or from the vi
cinity of Tonola to San Benito. It ia a
1 swampy country ani the ben for egrets
| that I ever saw. It is in Chiapas that
these beautiful birds and many others
hare their rookeries. The egrets always
select an island in a lake for their rook
eries. We found a place of this kind in
one of the lakes where there were. I sup
i pose, 5000 egrets, and there were as many
aa fire or six neits on a single bush. *
"The egrets were very tame there. They
had never been hunted in our style, as no
white men had ever beea there, and the
Mexicans do not know now to hunt them.
On this island the birds were to tame that
we went right among them and yet they
; wouldn't fly more than a dozen or twenty
j feet away.
"In the fi>e months we got a little OTer
| fifteen pounds of the egret feathers, which
we brought with us here. The feathers
are worth here about 133 an ounce, or a
total of $9000 approximately. If we don't
: get that we will go on to New York with
j them. The feathers are fine and we hare
no fear about realizing at least $33 an
ounce.
"We saw many wild animals, some of
which war* undoubtedly dangerous.
There are many tapirs down there. They
are low ponderous animals, weighing as
much as 800 pounds each, and when they
get started ;n a eiren direction keep right
along. They can't turn arc and. If you
keep out of the way yon are pretty apt to
be safe, otherwise you will get Into trouble.
"There are two kind* of tigers in the
jungles, too, and of those we saw severs..
One Â» a rery big animal, and the otnÂ»r
small. We got sereral of them. A bird
that interested U:. all was a singular fow!,
bigger if anything than a turkey, but with
a handsome crest. It resembles otherwise
the turkey, but flies like a pheasant wim
a whirring sound. The Mexicans eat
them, and we did also. We found the
meat wonderfully sweet like the pheasant.
There were so many of the birds that we
U:Â«i when we killed them just to slice the
meat off the breast and fry it, and let the
rest go. The meat was so white that it
was almost transparent
"There is a black duck there, too, that
is asbig as a goose and haa a warty neck
and head. It is splendid eating. The
alligators were pretiy agly at times, and
we had to loo* sharply out for them. On
one occasion one was stealing silently on
one of our men, when he killed it with
hi* shotgun."

WHITE LABOR A WINNER.
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald's
Conference With tlie
Hawaiians.
President Dole Appoints a C- ni -
id of Three to Confer With
Local Officials.
Labor Commissioner E. L. Fitzgerald
returned to this City on the Australia on
Wednesday from his quest in the Hawaiian
Islands, and brings with aim every assur
ance that American labor will cut a very
important figure there in the near future.
His final conference with the planters was
held May 5, when they virtually bound
themselves to give American labor the
preference over either European or Asiatic
competition at every good opportunity.
During his visit Commissioner Fitz
gerald has succeeded in convincing the
planters that in its finality cheat) labor is
more expensive and less satisfactory than
white labor. It was understood that the
coolies now employed will be sent home
as fast aa their contracts expire, and their
places filled with Americans.
As a result the labor question is likely
to be made the issue of the day in the
islands henceforth. The issue will be
heightened by the fact that Fitzgerald
gave the Hawaiian* to understand that
unless the preference is given to Ameri
can laborers he will use his influence to
turn the laboring classes here against an
nexation.
President Dole has appointed a Labor
Commission in the oersons of John Em
meluth, W. B. Armstrong and Alexander
Yoang. Armstrong ts now in San Fran
cisco.
"From the assurances received from the
planters and the Government," said the
Commissioner, "I am certain that they
are sincere in this matter. I fully recog
nize the fact that the planters must be
protected at all times, so did not ask for
any radical change in the employment of
labor on the plantations. I know that it
must be rradual, and am willing that it
should be so, so iong as it is steady and
continuous.
"A very large majority of the planters
have pledged me their word that they
will employ American laborers as fast as
room can be made for them on the sev
eral plantations. They agree, first of ail.
to secure tne 10 per cent of white laborers
required by law from America, and to fill
with American laborers the places left
vacant by the Japanese whose contracts
have expired."
Independent Rifles Ontlng.
The twentieth annual excursion and picnic
of the Independent Rifles will be held Sunday
atGlenwood Park, iv the StniiCnii Moun

for two trains to carry the excursionists. A
Urge number of gate prises will be distrib
uted. The excursion leaves the foot of Mar
ket street at 8:15 a. *.. and leaves Glenwood

ACTIVITY ON THE
VALLEY ROAD
Regular Trains Will Be
Running to Hanford in
a Few Days.
On May 22 the Event Wi^l Be
Formally Celebrated by
the People.
That Day Is the Anniversary of the
Birth of Kings Connty â Great
Demonstration Promised.
The work of extending the Valley road
is going forward bravely. The grading
between Fresno ana Han ford has been
finished and tracklayers are rushing the
job o: putting down tne rails, so that
trains over the line may ran into Hanford
on (he 22d inst.
Chief Engineer Story yesterday an
nounced that the work woaid be com
pleted on this section by May 22â which
is the day appointed for the grea: ce.ebra
tion in Kings Connty.
The ce.eoration will be a double-header,
May 22 is the birthday of Kings County,
and the thousands of farmers who will as
semble at the county seat on that day to
commemorate the anniversary of the coun
ty's birth will also celebrate then the com
pletion o: tbe Vailey road to that city.
Many prominent citizens of San Fran
cisco, among them several promoters o:
the railroad enterprise, are mak ng prep
arations to attend the celeoration. Ciaus
Spreckels, president of the San Franci-co
and San Jcaquin Vailey Railroad, may
not be able to attend. The warm weatcer
in the vaiiey at this time of the year is
not conducive to his health, still the hope
is expressed that he will attend the
demonstration. The people of Kings
County recognize the great service that
Lie has rendered to the State in general
and the Saa Joaquin Valley in particular,
and are therefore anxious that he shall
oe with them on this eventful aay.
The graders who were so actively en
zaged a few days ago on the lice from
Fresno to Hanford have been transferred
to the line from Fresno to Visalia, and
work on the latter section is now goin^
ahead with visor. The track is now iaiii
on t c Visaiia extension to Kings R ver.
Six weeks' tiinejmay be required to con
struct the important bridge to span this
s.ream. It should be understood that the
road forks at Fresno, one line going to
Haniord and the other to Visaha. At a
point twenty miies south of the latter
place the fores will unite. The prong
-â¢applying the greater tramc will be classed
as the main line.
In the work of conÂ«tnicuon the con
tractors. Grant Brothers, do the grading,
and lie company looks to the work of
track- iayine. It is the opinion of City
Engineer Story that the track-laying will
reach Hanford by the 20th inst. Some
work may be necessary around the yards
o accommodate the ceieoration trains,
bat everything will be in readiness by the
BdL
At a conference held Tuesday between
Vice- President Watt, Director Payson and
Traffic Manager Most it was decided to
ran two excursion trains from Fresno to
iianford on the 22d. One of these will
make close connection with the regular
train from Stockton, and thÂ« other viii
simply ran the thirty miles between
Fresno and Hanford. Special rates will
cc made for the round trip.
Thereafter a regular service will be es
tablished between San Francisco and Han
ford via Stockton, and two trains will De
operated, one leaving Stockton ana one
Han lord each day. -_ ; â 
While the passeifger eqnipinent that the
Valley road now possesses is adequate for
the service, four additional passenger
coaches have been ordered and will be pat
into service on their arrival.
Advices received by the company con
cerning the crops in the San Joaquin
Valley this season are to the effect that
the yie.'d of wheat will not be as large as
the first estimates contemplated. Tbe
yield oi fruit will be larjre, and the com
pany has ma le a low rate to encourage
shipment of tbe orchard product.

ANXIOUS ABOUT
PRESCOTT SAWYER
He Sailed From Tacoma in
His Yacht Eleven
Days Ago.
Friends Think He Should Have
Been Heard From by
Ths Time.
His Craft, the Schooner Josephine, Is
a Stout- Baut V ssei Bn;ht
in Tacoma.
I
Preacott SÂ»wyer, the wall-known yachts
man and son of the lace United States
Judge Sawyer, haa bÂ«en out elrren dayi
from Tacoma in his schooner yacht !
Josephine, and his friends nere are be- j
ginning to be anxious for his safety, par
ticularly as none of the incoming vessel*
from the north nave reported seeing the
trim pleasure- boat.
Young Sawyer has property interest! on
I Pnxet Soaad and nceatlj want thitati to
look after them. He is an enthusiastic
savor, and while on the sound saw and
admire i the handsome Josephine, a Ta
coma-bail t schooner, fifty-eight feet long
and elegantly fitted.
As she was for sale and he was amply
provided with funds be bought tne boat,
and the next heard of him he was pre
paring for a voyage to tian Francisco Bay
in bis new acquisition. He wrote to a
number of local yachtsmen inviting them
to go north and make the trip down,
promising to give them a pleasant voyage.
None were able to accept the invitation,
and a couple of weec* aso a letter waa re
ceived from Sawyer by a particular friend
stating thai he would sail on the 2d init..
with a crew of three seamen and a cook.
Sines then nothing has been heard of the
schooner, and his friends figure that ha
should have been well down the coast by
this time unless some accident has hap*
pened to the craft.
The Josephine is supposed to be a
stanch cra:t, that cost nearly $-5000 when
new, and Sawyer's friends say that while
he waa an adventurous fellow, fond of
danger and storms at sea, he was too
sensibl* to so noon the ocean unless bis
yacht was well found. The recent storms
chat have prevailed along the Oregon and
Washington coasts have given tnem food
for alarm, but they stiU have hope that hs
has been delayed by head winds and will
yet sail proudly into the bay with the
Corinthian emblem at bis masthead.
Sawyer is single, about 30 years of age,
and on the death of his fainer a few years
ago inherited sn ampie fortune. He paid
$2SOG tor the Josephine and spent several
hundred dollars in fitting her out for the
cruise to this City.

There should be no question at Wash

This is to be a boom year for army offi

The passage of the Greater New York

In comparison with last year there have

Senator Hoir'a statement that the Â»ngar
deal scandal of tne Wilson tariff and the
Morgan syndicate bond deal should be in
vestigated 10 the uttermost and probed
until the examination touches bottom is a
clear expression of popular sentiment on
iht'. bubject. The people would approve
such an investigation and would like to
see it bsgun at once.
According to Secretary Woodruff of the
Rational Muuicipai League, "every indi

among the larcer cities for the adoption
of reform through charter amendment
during the coming year." In this move

sooner or later. Charter amendment may
come high, but we must have it.
In beginning an agitation against the
"lese majeste" laws of the empire, the
German radicals will have the sympathy
of liberal men all round the world. The
imprisonment of a citizen because he
speaks "disrespectfully" of a ruler is a

happen to be a kaiÂ«er clothed with divine
right and endowed with a new uniform
every day.
Those New England people who call

the finished product of the Eastern mills.
In other words the hide must be in it

THE NICAKAGUA CANAL.
Evidences nave been given in many of
the recent dispatches from Washington
I that the project for constructing the Nica
ragua canal will soon coir.c to the front
again in Congress and will be .Â«upporte4
by the whole force of the administration.
Secretary Sherman is known to be favor
able to the enterprise and there i* every
reason to believe that President McKm
ley desires to make its accomplishment
one of the prominent features of his term
of oftice.
It was announced in The Cat.l a few
days ago thnt the statement made last
winter that the Nicarapuan Government
regarded the concession made to the
Maritime Canal Company as forfeited was
in some respects erroneous. The conces
sion has not been forfeited, and Secretary
Sherman, who is rejorted to be now en
paged in negotiating a treaty with the
Greater Republic of Central America for
the completion of thecanal, issaid to have
reached the conclusion that ihe best mer.ns
of carrying out the project will ba under
the original grant to the canal company.
AH these reports are encouraging. They
give assurance that the present adminis
tration, so far from being; antagonistic to
the ?reat undertaking, it not even indiffer
ent to it. The President and the Secretary
of State are already at work arranging
treaties under which it can be carried out,
and the chances are that when Congress
meets in regular session next winter some
definite plan will be ready for submission
to that body. It is known that the Sen
ate favors the enterprise and there is every
reason to believe that a majority of the
members of the House are equally in
cline;! to carry it out by the assistance of
the United States and under control of
our Government.
The importance of the canal is such
that every particle of news affecting it is
a matter of general interest. For that
reason there will be close attention given
to the subject, now that it is about to re
appear as a practical is^ue before Con
gress. While the subject has been lona
under discussion, it has never become
threadbare, because every one who favors
it fully recognizes the strength of the op
position and knows that unless its oup
porteri are incessantly active it can never
be accomplished. The news from Wash
ington will, therefore, revive the agitation
on the subject all over the country and
strenethen the energies of the friends oi
the measure by increasing their hope of
speedy success.
LESE MAJESTE.
The motion made in the Reichstag by
Herr Bebel to repeal tbe clau3e of the
German penal code bearing upon the
crime of "lese majeste" has started a de
bate the outcome of which will be waited
with no little interest not only by the
people of Germany but throughout the
wcr'd. This portion of the German law is
so clearly a relic of barbarism that it is
difficult to understand why an enlightened
people like the Germans have tolerated it,
and the manner in which it has been en
forced under the present Kaiser lias long
been a disgrace to his reicn.
In the debate upon the motion. Heir
Bebel pointed out tbat there lias been an
enormous increase in the number of trials
for this offense, and that tho scope of the
laws has been so widened by the judgment
of the courts that it is now construed as
"lese majeste" for a man to maica "disre
spectful" remarks about the Emperor,
even when the speaker is in his own
houÂ»e and talking in the presence of only
the members of his family. Further
more, the courts are taid to have com
pletely altered the origiaal conception of
the offense by inventing a crime of "indi
rect lese majeste," and condemning ac
cused persons who had not named the
Emperor, but who were merely supposed
to have meant him in making remarks
which could be considered disrespectful.
It is significant of the situation in Ger
many that before the debate besan one
; of the Socialist members of the Keichstag
j arose and warned the public in the gal-
I leries that several detectives were there,
and they had better refrain in discussing
1 the debate among themselves from ex
j pressing any opinions which the courts
! could construe as being violations oi' the
| law and offeneive to the dignity of the
i Kaiser. When freedom of speech among
| educated and intelligent men is so re
i strictec, .as this, it is time for the bolder
! leaders of liberalism to begin at once a
i war for liberty.
There can be no right government
among a people who are debarred by
penal statutes from the privilege of
discussing the conduct of their rulers.
Milton clearly expressed the supreme
value of free speech when be said:
"Give me the liberty to think, the liberty
to utter and the liberty to write above all
other liberty." This is, indeed, the
fundamental right of man, and the law of
"lese majeste" which denies it is as high a
tyranny as can bo imposed upon any peo-
THE CHAPMAN CASE.
The speech of Senator Hoar on tho reso
lution of Senator AiUn summoning El
verton Chapman to appear befdre the
Senate and purge himself of contempt by
answering the questions which he de
clined to answer when called as a witness
beloro the committee engaged in investi
gating the sugar trust scandal is one
which awakens a renewed hope that the
investigation will not bs dropped and that
the neople will in the end be made fully
acquainted with the inner history of that
transaction.
Senator Hoar's speech was made in re
ply to a statement of Senator Gallinger
that the resolution ought to go over be
cause he did not desire to be again sub
jected to the annoyance of the investiga
tion. Mr. Hoar said he desired the sugar
investigation, as well as an investigation
of the sale of bonds, should proceed to
the uttermost and should "touch bottom
before it stopped." He had no sympathy
with anybody who would whistle either
of these two inquiries down the wind.
The Stnate, be declared, ought to bring
Chapman before its bar and propound to
him again the questions he had refused to
answer, and if he did not now answer
he should be committed for contempt,
whether the President pardoned him or
not.
This is the kind of talk the people like
to hear from the Senate. The circum
stances under which the sugar duties
were fixed in the Gorman tariff constitute
one of the gravest legislative scandals in
our history, and for the honor of t.:e Sen
ate the subject ought to bs thoroughly in
quired into and the truth made known.
Moreover, as Senator Hoar suggests, the
bond deal made by Cleveland and Carlisle
with the Morgan syndicate should also be
examined.
It ia evident that such inquiries wontd
be worse than useless unless witnesses can
be compelled to testify to a Senate com
mittee as fully as they would be com
pelled to do in court. The issue is one of
the greatest importance not only to the
Senate but to the Nation. It ts gratifying
to have a Senator of the iullu-nce and
force of be aa; or Hoar insist upon coni

pelling the lecalcitrant witness to testify.
Both scandals should be probed by inves
tigations which will touch bottom before
they atop.
A WASHINGTON RUMOB.
According to dispatches from Washing
ton published in The Call yesterday an
rff jrt is being made by the New England
Marble Company to obtain from the Gov
ernment contracts for furnishing material
for the two Federal buildings which are
to be erected in Chicago and San Fran
cisco. It was further asserted that the New
Englanders had a "strong pull" and there
are chances that they will succeed unless
the quarrymen of the West are prompt
and vigorous in counteracting their ef
forts.
This story may be no more than a Wash
ington rumor. In the very nature of
things it cannot be traced to an official
source. It is nevertheless one of sutticient
imporiance to attract the attention of
Californians and to awaken them to the
possibility that the stonÂ« to be used in our
new building may be brought to us from
the far East instead of being taken from
our own quarries. Such a danger should
at once arouse the commercial and in
dustrial bodies of the State to take what
ever action may be necessary to over
come it.
The truth of the rumor is confirmed to
some extent by the statement in the dis
patch that Californians now at Washing
ton are trying to have the upper structure
of the building iv this City constructed of
California stone. It is said that the selec
tion of the stone will probably be made
by the officials of the Treasury Depart
men t, though Congressman Loud believes
that in this case the usual rule will be de
parted from and the choice of material
left to the Committee on Public Buildings.
California has a right to expect that
home material will be used for the con
struction of the building in San Fran
cisco. We wouid lose much of the benefit
expectel from thÂ« constrnction if any
large portion of the material is brought
from the East which could be obtained
here. It is probable that the selection of
the stone will soon be made and our citi
zens should act promptly in urging upon
those in authority to require the use of
material from California quarjies.
AROUNL THE CORRIDORS.
A little book of selected verse by Howard V.
Sutherland will be published Bhortly in this
City by I. J. Healey. The verses have, for the
greater part, been floating around in different
publications ior the last few years aud will
make a volume of about eighty pages or so.
The author, still a young man, began his
active literary career in California as a re
porter on The Call about three and a half
years ago; he then became associated with
.1 .inn's H. Barry of the Star for two years, aud
later had charge of the News Letter.
Mr. Sutherland does not pretend to have
any great messaga to convey, and merely
hopes to Income known as a writer of simple
iyrics and love songs and as a stanch upholder
of the West.
He believes poetry should come from the
heart and that it should appeal to the heart.
Certain of the verses that will appear in the
coming volume w^re written before the writer
came to this country, but most of them first
saw the light in California.
"This collection of poems." said Mr. Suther
land yesterday, "is to some extent made up of
poems printed in leading San Francisco and
Eastern and Southern publications during the
past two years, but a number of other poems
liÃve been added. I hope to get the book out
in a short time, and m>ty also say that If It
meets the expectations oi some of my friends
who have urgod me to make the publication,
I shall bo more than pleased." "
Mr. Sutherland, as soon a< he gets his manu
script in shape so he can leave it, will jo to
the mountains for a short time, and later will
visit New Yors.

A WONDERFUL CAST.
Next Sunday's Call will contain an account of the discovery of a cast made from the orig
inal death mask of the great Emperor Napoleon. This is interesting in itself, no matter where
the cast may have been found. But to add to the interest tho cast was found in Mexico
and at the present time is in the %*nited States. It is romantic in the extreme. In fact, a
novelist with the most fertile imagination could evolve nothing stranger. There is no doubt
of the genuineness of the cast. It is one of five that were made from the original mask taken
shortly after the death of the great general and there are plenty of letters and pr.pers to prove
all tho claims made fo' it. Sunday's Call will tell nil about the valuable relicâ how it came
to be made, where it disappeared to and what Its future will be-
There will be Â«lso an account of some of the strangest edifices in the world. They were

Some of the grea< observatories ot the world will be described by Professor Hoideu, who, as

Letters From Our Readers on Topics of Current
Interest.
President Jordan on State Duties.
Editor of the San Francisco C a' lâ Â£tk: President David Starr Jordan of the Leland Stanford
Jr. University commands my respectful attentiou whenever he addresses the uublic, lor
something of his large and forceful personality imbues whatever he says and clothes it with ft
certain air of authority which well becomes the man nnd the place he tills. One does not need
to agree with him in order to be impressed with the vigor of his thought and the force of his
words. I also think there is less cant and more truth, as he sees it, In what he says than in
the speech of most men who address the public. He may say blunt things now and then, but
is that a fault In these days?
It was a loss 1 regret that I did not hear him address the Pure Food Congress, but I read
and laid aside the meager newspaper reports of what he said for the purpose of asking public
consideration of certain du'.ies of the State, which he set forth with his usual force and
effectiveness. The verbal accuracy of the reports may be open to inquiry, but the internal
evidence favors the claim of inaccuracy, ily comments are based upon the assumption of
substantial accuracy.
He is reported to have said "that he came to speak in order that he might show the deep
interest he felt in the movemsnt; not that he knew anything about pure food, not having seen
any to his knowledge since he left the farm, twenty-five years ago. He thought the law with
reference to the manufacture and sale of impure food did not go far enough. It should not
not only be made very unprofitable, but extremely disagreeable. Every offender should be
fined and sent to jail."
This is strong talk and much to the point. He cited Aristotle as authority for It. Aristotle
Â«Â«ys: "It is the duty of the S-.ate to reach every worthy end," and President Jordan gives an
example of State duty in conformity with the law laid down by Aristotle. He says: '' Private
Individuals cannot analyze baking powder and other adulterated food, but the State can." I
think no one will dissent from this view of State duty, and that all feel the need of State action i
in thia Hue of duty except the "offender," who Is to "be fined and sent to jail," for it no doubt I
is true that
flogue ne'er felt the halter draw
With good opinion of the law.
President Jordan then quoted Herbert Spencer as saying: "Save the people from the con
sequences of their own foliy and you will fill the world with fools." "The deduction is that
people must commit folly," Â»ays President Jordan, "aud suffer the consequences if the world
is to grow any wiser." Then why should President Jordan address the Pure Food Congress?
Why should there be a Leiand Stanford Juuior University and a David Starr Jordan president
of it? It every child muu be burned Jn order to dread the fire, and every untutored girl com
mit folly and suffer the consequences if they arc lo grow any wiser, we have no need of the
university and a Jorditn to teach us the nature of folly and the wisdom needed to avoid it.
President Jordan next quotes Thomas Jefferson as siying, "Man has the right to life, lib
erty and tbe pursuit of happiness," and then proceeds to say: "If all the legislation was given
the unemployed that they ask for it would fill the world with unemployed. It is not a wise
charity to find work ior the unemployed. The enterprise of finding worK is what makes
men." In his position and with his munificent salary as president of Stanford University,
when he speaks thus of the unemployed, so many of whom have wives and helpless children
in sore need of food, clothes and decsnt shelter, one is reminded of the ancient philosopher
who wrote an able treatiso on the advantages of poverty and used a solid gold table on which
to write it. But I must defer to another time some deductions I desire to make from these
views of President Jordan. Joseph Asbury Johnson.

FRATERNAL DEPARTMENT.
The Presentation of a Handsome Flag
to La Kstrella Parlor of the
Native Daughtsra.
Whatever La Kstrella Parlor does it does
well, and this assertion is basel upon wnat it
has done since its organization a year ago.
This applies with special force to what this
parlor did last Wednesday night in celebra
tion of i;s first anniversary in Native Sons'
Hall.
To commemorate this event in the life of the
parlor Miss Helen Kiuse, who is as patriotic
ns any one can possibly be, made for the par
lor a magnificent American flag nine feet long
Â«nd of proportionate width of heavy silt rib
bon. Speaking of the flag, the handsomest
owned by any parlor in the State, oue of the
officeâ¢ said: "Miss Kruse was engaged for
nearly nine months in making this nag, every
stiich was hand-sewed by her, and the white
silk embroidered stars each took two hours of
her time in the making, but it was a labor of
love and oi patriotism, and Bhe as well as
every member of the parior feels pmuil ol
those glorious stars and stripes, and while we
venerate Old Glory, we love this particular
one the more because of the noble-hearied
maker and the unselfishness that prompted
her to present it to toe parlor."
The hall had been decorated in star-spangled
pale blue and light yellow, with a proiuiion
of garlands, baskets of flowers aid lanterns,
while in front i>f the stage there was a large
bank of ev<Mgreen, iv which were distributed
potted roses of various flues and fairy inmps
of many colors. Over the stage was suspended
star-bedecked, festooned, ligtu material ot the
prevailing colors, and across it in siiver let
ters was tne name of the parlor. The leiters
were of novel shape and a relief irom the
golden block ones so irequently used in deco
rations. Suspended from the center of the
hall was the emblem of the parlor, thÂ«t whicli
indicates Us nnme, an immense star of taste
fully arranged material.
Alter the grand march, which was led by
Senior Pa.-t President Miss Louise McCarthy
ana President Mrs. Lucy Barbich, tnere were
two dances, and theu followed the presenta
tion of the flaif, the gift of Miss Kruse, who
wai the first vice-president of the parlor.
There was an introduction by Mrs. Mary E.
TiUman, the grand president oi the order,
which was followed by a patriotic address by
Miss Mariana Bertola, junior past, president,
the one who during her term of office Induced
tho parlors to display tha American flag at
every meeting and on all public occasions.
At the conclusion of herafldress she, on behalf
of the donor, presented the flag to the parlor,
and in a graceful speech it was received by
Mrs. Uarblch, the pr<?side:>t, who pledged Jhat
it will be solemnly guarded and cherished by
every member of the parlor.
This was followed by the singing of "The
Flog Thftt Stirs Our touls" by Mrs. Grace E.
Dodge in a manner that moved the large audi
ence to long and hearty applause. The singer
was joined in the beautnul chorus by the
voices of twenty young ladies who were con
cealed by a large flag that served as a drop
curtain. At ilieclosoot the song tne orchestra
played "The Star-spangled Banner," and, the
flag being raised, exposed a magnificent tab
leau representing the Goddess ot Liberty (Miss
Helen Kruse) presenting Caliioruia (Miss
Minnie KleveÂ»ah.) with the flag. Miss Emma
Fenstermachur personated Eureka, the whole
making a most beautiful, patriotic California
picture.
After that there came "La Estrella Drill" by
twenty young ladies, lone attired all in red,
others all in white and the others all in blue,
suggestive of patriotism end decidedly effec
tive. The drill, a vÂ«ry pretty and dramatic
one, was under the 'management of Captain
Irelan, and it was loudiy applauded. Then
followed dancing, which was kept up until
long after mid dgnt.
Asa memmito of the event there was pre
sented a souvenir programme, star shaped,
that bore upon its lace embossed the Ameri
can and bear flags crossed and surrounded by
California popple? , in the center of Which ap
peared the picture of the donor of the flag,
while underneath were medallion pictures of
Mrs. Till man and Miss Bertola.
The affair was under the management of the
foliowlng-named, who can claim the credit of
having given one of the most enjoyable enter
tainments ever given by a local parlor :

SMOKE HOME CIGARS.
A Few Facts Presented by tho Cigar-
HakÂ«rt' Inlon for Public Con
sideration.
TbÂ« following address to the public,
issued by the Cigar-makers' Union of San
Francisco, will doubtless receive earnest
attention at the hands of thinking citizens :
Can ft city prosper where its leading busi
ncts men are jobbers iastead of manufac
turers?
We hold that a jobber it a detriment to a
community, whereas a manufacturer as^iMs in
the growth of a city, which means prosperity
to everybody residing in said city.
The jobbers claim tuat we cannot make as
good a cigar here as they do in the East. This
statement we brand as a falsehood. We defy
the jobbers to contradict the following :
Ist. We hold that onr manufacturers have the
same chanre in the tobacco market aa In any
manufacture In the United Mates.
â¢-M. That our mechanics are as good as in any
part of the United States.
3d. Thai our climate here Is better adapted for
manufacturing of cigars than any other states Id
the Union.
Thosa Jobbers when confronted with the
above facia will then turn and tell the smokers
that tne wage* in this City are too high. We
also brand that as a falsehood. The wages
paid in San Francisco are no higher than in
any other city in the United States, excepting
the filthy tenement-Douses, the cigars from
which are almost exclusively handled by our
jobber*.
Every lover of San Francisco must think of
the old maxim that seif-preservation is the
firat law of nature. By smoking no other
cigar than that made at home our business
depression will soon disappear. The jobber*
will be compe led to ot>en factories, and
thereby become public benefactors or conduct
their faker business somewhere else.

Reception and Presentation of a
Sword at the Presidio
C ub
Brigadier-General William R. Shafter
received a message by wire from Washing
ton yesterday requesting him to remain
in San Francisco until official orders
reached him.
Army officers interpret this message to
mean that General Shafter will not go to
the Department of the Columbia, but will
succeed General For.syth in the command
of the Department of California. In fact
this announcement was unofficially given
â¢o General bhafter in Washington some
days ago. It is the gossip in army circles
that General Forsyth, haying been pro
moted to the grade of major-general, will
soon ask to be retired.
General Shalter feels so confident of his
assignment to duty as commander o: this
uepartmeiH that he hns declared his in
tention 10 occupy the large house at Fort
Mason, wnicii was constructed during
General McDowell's administration of
army affairs at this station.
A reception in honor of General Shatter
was given ai the Presidio Club Wednes
day evening. The officers of the First
United States Infantry presented him
with a magnificent sword. The speech of
presentation was happily made by Po*t
Adj-.itant Noble. Ladies participated in
the joys of trie assembly, and altogether a
happy time was had. General Forayth
was there and, of course, <ame in fora
share of the congratulations. The First
Infantry band discoursed sweet music,
and around the punch bowl songs were
sung.

and Captain Tozier, Lieutenant Butt and
Chief Engineer Butler had many visitors
as soon as she came to an anchor off
Powell-street wharf. All speak in the

of the vessel.
The new gunboat Marietta had her en

JUDGE SLACK ANGRY.
Attorney Campltell Tells of an Attempt
to Make liar Vt title the San
Was Shining.
Judge Slack was angry yesterday morn
ing and he was not averse to announcing
that fact, for it seems that somebody had
been trifling with the court in the insol
vency matter of O'Ccnnell & Lewis.
When O'Connell & Lewis were declared
insolvent . last December 'William Lang
was appointed assignee. He had in his
service a man named A. J. Meadows, who
assisted in disposing o: some property.
Attorney H. C. Campbell, representing
the Vulcan Iron Works, was one of the
bidder? and made an offer of $10'J0. Ac
cording to Mr. Campbell's statement lie
was approached by Meadows, who offered
to transfer the property to the Vulcan
Iron Works for $575, My ing: "Of course,
we want to make some percentage en the
proposition."
All this was rehearsed by Attorney
Frank I. Kingweil when the case came up
in Judge Slack's court yesterday. He ex
onerated Mr. Campbell and the Vulcan
Iron Works, Baying that they had made
the offer in good faith and stood ready to
pay tbe money into court, according to
the original conditions of their contract.
Mr. Kingwell intimated that somebody
had been trying to indulge in "funny busi
ness" at the expense of the creditors of
O'Connell & Lewis, and he thought that
Lang should be removed and Meadows
punished.
Judge Slack showed that such "funny
business" is not popular in bis depart
ment of the Superior Court and asked Mr.
Kingweli to prepare the necessary papers
for bringine tue matter up for investiga
tion at 10 o'clock next Thursday morning.

NEW ROAD LAWS
OF THE STATE
j A Very Important Opinion
by the Attorney-
General.
Â» â  â 
The County Supervisors Must
Put the Machinery Into
Operation.
- â _-:.
Trustees Must Be Appointed for the
First Term and Elected
.There after.
Since the last Legislature enacted a law
for the establishment of a uniform system
of road government and administration in
the State the road overseers, Boards of
Supervisors and District Attorneys all
over California have been entirely at sea as
to how to put the new law into operation;
algo if put into operation whether it will
or will not conflict with certain Drovisions
of the county government act passed at
the same session.
In order to become enlfghtened upon
these matters the puzzled officials have
appealed to the Attorney-General of the
State for an opinion and interpretation of
the two laws. Letters of inquiry have
poured into the Attorney-General's cilice
from all parts of the State, for there is not
a single county, excepting that or the City
and County of San Francisco, tut that is
interested.
In reply to these inquiries Attorney-
Generai W. F. Fitzgerald has â written two
opinions which deal with nearly every
point not understood. His opinion, which
will be of interest to every public officer
in the State, is here given in full:
B. A. Htrrington, Esq., District Attorney of
Santa C'aia County, San Jose, Oat.âDMAXVtM:
lam in receipt oi your favor ol the lÂ»t inst.,
iv which you refer to an apparent fonfl ct be
tween the county government act ana an act
to establish a uniform t>ystem of road govern
ments, both of which were passed by the last
Legislature, and iv which you request me to
give you my opinion upon the following ques
tions: "Firstâ Can the two acts exist togetner?
Second â If not, which act will govern as to
road matters'.' Thirdâ Must we hold elections
tbis year for Road Trustees? '
First and secondâ l am ot the opinion that
there is no serious conflict between the two
acts in question, and that it was dearly the
intuntiun of the Legislature (hat the act for
the establishment of a uniform *ystÂ«ni of
ruad government should prevail. Sued, vision
4 of section 25 of the county government act
(me section iviiich relates to the "general per
manent powers" of Boards of Supervisors) pro
vides that such boards shall liave jurisdic ion
"to lay out, maintain, control, construct, re
pair and manage public roads, turnpikes, fer
ries, wharves, chutes and other shipping facil
ities and bridges witbin the county, unless
otherwise provided by law."
The saving clause, "unless otherwise nrc
vided by iaw," was, in my opinion, placed
U >-re for the express purpose of meeiin? tne
question now under consideration. In draft
ing the county government act its fraraers
could not, of course, anticipate the probable
action of the Legislature upon the road law
which was pending beiore it. Therefore, they
naturally made provision in the county gov
ernment act for a system of road government
under the supervis.on of tne Board <>f Super
visors, to be effective "unless otherwise pro
vided by law" â that iÂ«, unless the sp?cial set
for a uniform system cf road governments
which was pending before the Legislature
pnssed and met with the nporoval of the Gov
ernor. Furthermore, the two nets were passed
on tne same day and go into effect at the same
time. They are, therefore, in paria materla,
and, so far as they concern the same subject
matter, must bÂ« rend together as if pans of
the same act. (Endlich on the Interpretation
of Statutes, sections 45-139; People vs. Jack
son, 30 Cal., 427-430). Subllvision 2of sec
tion 23 of the road act proviaes:
That all powers and duties by this act conferred
upon road districts and their rfncÂ»r.Â«, which are by
any law enacted prior to arid existing at me time
of the taking effect of this act, conferred upon
road oveneers, or road commissioner!, or Board*
cf Supervisors, or other oÃicerÂ», shall be deemed
withdrawn by this act irom the officers' list above
named and < out -rr<?.l exclusively upoa roaa dis
tricts and their officeiS.
From this, although it purports to relate to
laws enacted "prior 'o and existing at the
timeot the taking effect" of the road act the
legislative intent is apparent, and reading it
in connection with the saving clause, "unless
otherwise provided," Jn the provisions of the
county government act, above quoted, there
can be no doubt that the road law aud not the
county government act must control wherever
tiie two ere in apparent conflict.
Thirdâ ln repiy to your third question I in
close you a copy of an opinion this day re
ferred by me to ihe District Attorney of San
Bernardino County. Respectiully,
\V. F. Fitzoekai-d, Attorney-General.
F. B. Daley, Esq., 'District Attorney of San
Bernardino County, San Bernardino, Cat.â Dear
Sir: I am in receipt of your lavor or recent
date, relative to "An act for the establishment
of a uniform system of road government and
administration in the counties of the State of
California," approved April 1, 1897, in which
you ask (1) will such law be operative after
June 1 next, and (2) if so, how it can be put
into operation?
Firstâ As there iÂ« no provision in the act It
self as to when it sha.l lake effect, it goes into
force "on trie sixtieth day after its passage"
(section 323 Political Code), that Ib, on the
sixtieth day alter April 1, 1897, which is May
31, 1837.
Secondâ Your Becond question is one of ex
treme difficulty, and it can only be freed from
the doubts which surround it by a decision
ot the Supreme Court which, in view of the
public interests involved, should be obtained
as speedily as possib c.
I am. however, of the opinion that it was
the intention of the Legislature that the act
should be put into immediate operation.
Effect mutt be eiven to that intention if it is
possible to do so. The chief difficulty arises
from the fact (hat there is no express author
ity conferred upon any person or board to put
the machinery of the road government pre
scribed by the act in motion. An annual elec
tion of road trustees is provided for, but the
entire machinery oi such election is placed in
the hands of the road trustees themselves,
who are officials created by this act, and for
t be appointment or election of whom in the
first instance no express provision is made
The -last Saturday ol May cf each year" Is the
time fixed by the act for holding the annual
election of road trustees. The last Saturday
of May of this year falls upon the 29th, and
as the act docs not take effect until two days
later, tlie 3lit, it iB, ol course, impossible to
hold a regular election for such officers until
the last Saturday of May, 1898.
It seems to be weil settled that "a newly
created office whicli is not Wiled by the tribu
nal which created it becomes vncant oa the
instant of its crea:ion." '(Am. <fc Eng. Ency. of
Law, vol. 19, p. 431, and cases cited.) Al
though this is i,ot specifically enumerated in
tde act itse.f as one vi the grounds of vacancy,
it is a principle nevertheless recognized in
that ponton of section 19 of the ect which
provides that -'vaciuieies in the office of trus
tee in a new district shall be rilled as are other
vacancies." It this principle obtains, and in
order to carry out the ititeution of the Legisla
ture it must of necessity do so, it follows that
as soon as the act in question take* effect there
t will be a vacancy in caen of the offices of road
I trustee in all the road districts in the State.
The remaining questiou, then, is how such
vacancy shall be tilled? Subdivision 3of sec
tion 9 of the act provides that:
When a vacancy occurs from any of the causes
j specified In sec. ion Â»96 of the Political t ode of
I this Mate n,.- ttomd i f supervisors shall appoint
j a suitable oersoa to till such vacancy until tbe
j Ist, day ot July next succeeding such appoint
ment.
Section 18 specifically enumerates vacancies
in the office of road trustee to be caused, in
addition to "the happening of any of- the
events specified in section 990 of the Political
Code," as follows: "By failure to elect, as pro
vided in section 9" of the act, and "by the
resignation of a trustee." Section 19 provides
that whenever a new district is organized such
of the trustees of the old district as reside
within the boundaries of the new district shall
be trustees of the new district until the expi
ration of their term of office, and that '-vacan
cies in the office of trustee in a new district
shall be rilled as are other vacancies" ; and in
the same section it is provided that "no per
son shall bs appointed to fill any vacancy ex
cept upon petition signed by at least ten
doctors of the district; provided, that a va
cancy may be filled in any case upon petition
signed by a majority of the electors of the
district."
We have thus express authority conferred
upon the Board of Supervisors to fill vacancies
which occur under the provisions of section
990 of the Political Code, Â»ad so far as direct
: provision is concerned tne law is silent as to
how other vacancies shall be filled. Ordi-
I narily the express autuority to fill certain
! specific vacancies wou'd under the familiar
rule.expressiounius exclusioaiterins. exclude
that board from the right to fill other vacan
cies, and the silence of the act so far as a
direct provision as to filling other vacancies is
concerned would under the provision* of sec
tion 8 of article V of the constitution vest'the
right to fill them in the Governor.
It is, however, well settled "that In the con
struction of statutes lor the purpose of ascer
taining the legislative intent, regard is to be
j had no; so much to the exact phraseology in
which that intention has been expressed, as
to the general tenor and scope of the entire
I legislative scheme embodied in the act." (Tea
bury vs. Arthur, 28 Cal., 142; Knowles v*.
Yate.-, 31 Â» a 1.,82; People vs. San Francisco,
80 Cal., 595, 600; Palache vs. Pacific In
surance company, 12 Cal., at pise 430; City
of baa Diego vs. Gran d is, 77 Cal., 517; and
People vs. Ikelroth, 7S Cal., 141, 143.) Apply
ing this familiar rule of statutory construc
tion it is manifest, Horn an entire considera
tion of the act in question, that, to carry out
"the legislative scheme embodied In the act,"
ltvai the intention of the Legislature that
the Board of Supervisors should be the motive
power or machinery for putting and keeping
that scheme in operation.
The first section of the act makes It the duty
of the Boards of Supervisors in the several
counties in this State in which road districts
do not now exist "to subdivide such, counties
Into road districts as by law now provided";
aud the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth,
seventh, and eighth sections of the act vest the
Boards of Supervisors with full authority for
the creation of new districts, for the change of
boundaries of old districts and for the con
solidation oi two or more districts.
By subdivision 1 of section 9 of the act the
compensation of road trustees is prescribed,
and 1-* "to be allowed by the Board of Super
visors" when certain conditions prescribed by
that section are complied with. By section 15
of the act the election certificates of persons
elected as road trustees "must, with the oath
of office oi the person so elected attache d
be forwarded, to the clerk of the
Board of Supervisors of the county and be
tiled by him in ins office. By subdivision 3of
section 18 of the act resignations of trustees
must be tendered to the Board of Supervisors
of the county and must be accepted by such
board. By subdivision 6ot section 20 it is the
duty of the rOad trustees to make annual re
ports to the Hoard of Supervisors. Section 41
of the act prohibits any Supervisor from being
i interested in any contract made by the Board
of Trustees of a road district, section 42 ot
the act makes the Board of Supervisors the
final auditing board for all demands against
any road district presented to the Board of
Trustees of such district.
Section 43 makes it a penal offense to offer!
any valuable thing, to any member of the
Board of Supervisors or any member of the
Road Trustee! "with intent thereby to influ
ence his action in regard to the. purchase of
any property lor his road district, or, in case
of such Supervisor, for any roaa district in
his county, or the making of any contract by
or on be., of or effecting or to be paid out
of the funds or with the property of such road
district." Finally, the seventh article of the
act, including sections 44 to 53. provides for
the "voting and issuance of road district
bonds." and an examination of that article
shows that the election must be called by the
Road Trustees for thai purpose, and that
where the vote is iv favor of bond 3 such fact
I shall by certified to the Board of Supervisors,
| whereupon the Board of Supervisors shall
I direct the issue of â  the bonds, shall prescribe
their form and the manner of their sale.
-Ail of these provisions show cleailythat
the moving power behind the Board of Trus
tees is the Board of Supervisors of the county;
and it was the Intention of the Legislature
that the initiative of putting the act into
operation must be taken by ihe Board of Su
pervisors. 1 am, therelore, of the opinion that
the Board oi Supervisors of each county In the
State should appoint road trustees to fill the
vacancies in the office which will exist when
the act under consideration goes intoeff c,
subject to the provisions of section 19, thai
"no person shall be appointed to flu any
vacancy except upon petition signed by at
least ten electors of the district; provided,
that a vacancy may be filled in any case upon '
petition signed by a. majority of the decors
of the district." I am further of the opinion
that at the earliest day possible the validity
of such appointments should be tested In the
courts. Respectfully, â¢.,-â â¢â

DENICKE'S BURGLAR
AN EX-CONVICT
Just Completed a Three-
Year Term for a Sim
ilar Crime.
Capture of a Dangerous Crimi
nal by O.ficers Loiig and
Caples.
He Resumed the Business of Burglary
as Soon as Released From the
Folsom Prison.
The alleged tailor, ' William H. Van
Pelt, who was found last Wednesday even
ing about dusk in the parlor of Capitalist
Denicke's residence, on the corner of
Mason and Sacramenty streets, has been
identified by Detectives Bee and Harper
as Samuel W. Private, whom they arresttd
in 1894 on a charge of burglary.
.Private was convicted of the crime and
on December 22, 1891, was sentenced to
three years' imprisonment in the Folsom
prison. His term expired on April 17 of
this year, and on the day after he came to
this City.
Policemen Caples and Long, who cap
tured Private last Wednesday evening,
alter an exciting chase, discovered yester
day that wben Private returned here from
the Folsom penitentiary he took a room
at the Capital House, 537 Sacramento
street, and that he had been living on the
proceeds of burglary ever since that time.
He was, however, very cunning in his
actions, and never left stolen property in
bis room more than a few hours at a time.
He evidently had a "fence" somewhere,
and bis room wa3 a halfway bouse Xrom
the houses which he robbed and the other
thief who received the stolen goods.
A few days ago be left a bundle of
woman's clothes in his room for two
hour*, and then took jt away with him.
On Wednesday morning be Drought in a
larce clock, and at 11 o'clock in the fore
noon took it away.
Private, alias Van Pelt, when discovered
in the parlor by a woman servant of Capi
talist Denicke, put on a stupid expression
and had hia mouth open, pretending to be
in an ecstacsy of admiration over the
beautiful statuettes and mantel orna
ments. He walked leisurely out of Ibe
door, but when he heard Mr. Denicke
comine after him he ran swiftly down
Clay street.
Policemen Long and Caples saw the
man running and heard the capitalist cry,
"Stop thief!" between puffs, and they
joined in the chase. Private darted into
rrusp i; ct place, but before he could reach
Sacramento street, the policemen inter
cepted nitn. He told them that he had
arrived from Portland that morning, and
that taking a stroil up tbe hill he saw the
door of tbe Denicke mansion standing
open. He entered, through curiosity, and
was so wrapt up in admiration of the
beautiful things in the parlor that he did
not hear tbe good-looking servant-girl
come in.
When Long asked why he had rnn away
he replied that be was trying to catch a
Clay-street car.
"But the Clay-street cars don't run
down bill," said Long. 'They run up
hill."
Whereupon Convict Private, alias Tailor
Van Pelt, held his peace.
He was identified yesterday as a man
who entered the resilience of Robert Sher
wood on Nob Hill Slonday morning and
stole a quantity, of articles. He was ob
-erved and chased, but escaped. In his
flieht he dropped all the articles except a
jewel-casa, which was fortunately empty.
The oolice think that he has committed
other burglaries, and Detectives Bee and
Hart er are investigating,
At the time he was arrested in the latter
part of 1894 he was a member of the Sal
vation Array band. He was looked upon
as :i shining light, the only fault he bad
being a fondness tor strong drink. Three
instruments belonging to other members
of t lie band were stolen, bat I'nvaie
was not suspected till Bee and Harper re
covered one of the instruments from a
pawnshop and Private was identified as
the man who pawned it.

sity and Apollo Choral Societies will be re

Sensational Report of the

Schools.
CLAIMS A MISMANAGE
MENT OF FUNDS.
Teachers' Salaries Will Not Be
Held Out During His
Term.
BOARD WARNED TO REGARD
THE LAW.
Lapsed Teachers' Certificates Cannot
Be Renewedâ llliteracy I 3
Growing
Superintendent of Schools R. H. Web
ster poured hot shot into bis predecessor,
Madison BabcoeS, in a report read at
Wednesday's meeting of the Board of Ed
ucation, and also told the board itself that
the law is being disregarded ia many
ways.
Mr. Webster's report was long, but it
was to the point, and couched in language
that could not be misunderstood.
He stated that Mr. Babcock, in his
handling of the funds of the teachers' ref
erence library and of the Teachers' Insti
tute, had acted illegally, and asked perti
nent questions as to what had become of
books that had cost a considerable sum of
money.
To the board be announced flatly that
daring his term of office there would be
no withholding of teachers' salaries and
that he would refuse to sign demands for
the payment of supplies when they
seemed to him unnecessary.
The board was taken aback by the Su
perintendent's address, and listened to
the reading by Mr. Webster in respectful
silence.
Then, without a dissenting voice and
without discussion, it was accepted and
placed on file.
Referring to the Teachers' Institute and
the manner in which it has heretofore
been handled, Mr. Webster said:
Sections 1560 and 1562 of the Political Code
of this State provide that the Superintendent
must bold at least one teachers' institute in
each year; that every teacher employed in a
public 6Chool in the City and County must
attend such institute and participate In its
proceedings; that each session of the institute
must continue not less than three nor more
than five days, and that the expenses oi said
institutes must not exceed $200 annually,
payable out of the funds provided for by sec
tion 1565. Years have elapsed since this law
has been strictly obeyed by the Superintend
ents of this City and County.
I have addressed two communications to toy
immediate predecessor, Mr. Babcock, asking
him if he has held a teachers' institute in this
City and County during the present fiscal
year, in accordance with sections 1560 and
1562 of the. code, and if so to state when,
v. uereand under what circumstances it was
held.
His answer is, to wit: "Teachers' meetings
have been held during the year in compli
ance with the spirit of the law referred to."
This, it will be observed, does not answer my
question. The practice has been, in instances,
to close the schools lor an afternoon, convoke
the teachers at a ha.L to listen to some itiner
ant lecturer, engaged at a very liberal re
muneration, ana to repeat this procedure at
intervals of months. This is not in law nor
in fact a teachers) Institute. Since the be
ginning of tne fiscal year my immediate
predecessor did in August engage Mr. W. Hail
mann to lecture, at $50; in November Mr.
W. H. T. Eaymond was paid $50 for address
ing the teachers; in December Mr. Hailmann
again spoke to the teachers and was again
paid $50; is January Doctress Mara L. Pratt
did, for a compensation of $150, render six
lectures at different dates to various sections
of teachers. Many teachers were never Jn
lormed of tflese lectures nor requested to at
tend them.
In passing, it is well to note that the total
money spent on these functions, including
a hall rent of $10, was $310. This is $110
more tban the law provides shall be expended
on a regular session or sessions of teachers'
institutes annually. It is for Mr. Babcock to
Justify this expenditure of money from the
library and institute fund. A teachers'insti
tute has not been held in this City and County
during the fiscal year.
Mr. Webster then turned to the teach*
er"' reference library and gave figures to
show that during the past eight years the
income of the institution from fees for the
renewal of certificates has aggregated
$4000.
Then he resumes bis charges thus:
Since assuming the duties of the office of
Superintendent I have discovered that no
record has been kept of the receipts and dis
bursements of this fund, except as can be de
termined by an examination of the vouchers
and stubs of receipt-books for pest years.
But reference to the manner in which this
fund has been managed since July 1. 1896, by
my immediate predecessor.may be of interest.
Ec drew his requisitions on the Auditor to the
total amount oi $951 85. Of this, as has been
stated, the excessive sum of $310 was for al
leged institutes, the remainder lor the teach
ers' library as follows, to wit: :
â Overland Monthly from 1868 to
1896. bound JlB9 00
Stationery 72 60
Subscription to Overland Monthly 244 &0
Decemberâ Library books.. 76 80
Februaryâ Books. 69 05
Total. $641 86
It is well to examine these items. The sum
of $189 was expended for bound volumes of
the Overland Monthly from 1868 to 1896 All
these books are not in the library. Xuere are
bound volumes of that periodical from 1880
to 1896 only. Where are the other books
Mr. Webster calls attention to the fact
that the law makes the Superintendent
the custodian of the library and responn
bie for its contents. He is required to
keep a record of the books taken there
from and returned thereto.
Mr. Webster claimed that the item of
$244 50 for subscription to the Overland
Monthly is entirely illegal, anrr that it
should be $1 50; and also that the item
of $72 50 for stationery is not authorized
by law, as far as he was able to de
termine.
Mr. Webster sums up his review as fol
" lows:
It will be observed from this review that at
least over $300 has been drawn from this fund
during the present fiscal year contrary, to
law. - . . '-""-r.-
The Superintendent sounded a warning
that the law was being violated regarding
lapsed teachers' certificates in the follow
ing language:
An expired or lapsed certificate cannot be re
newed. That which is dead has no life to pro
long. They are simply affidavits that the per
son named therein was entitled to teach in the
public schools during the time specified by
them and no longer. Under section 1860 of
the Political Code no district is entitled to re
ceive any apportionment ot State moneys un
less all teachers hold leeal certificates of fit
ness for teaching in full force and effect.
Applications are being received by the
Board of Examiners of this City and County
for renewal of expired, lapsed or dead certifi
cates. â ";:,. â . - - â¢ ' â 
The board cannot grant these requests. All
teachers not holding life diplomas should be
careful to make application . in regular form
for the renewal of their certificates before the
date of their expiration.
The compulsory educational law also
came in for a share of Mr. Webster s at
tention, and he declared that it appeared
neifer to have been observed, and that as
a result there is a growing illiteracy
among the people of this City that is
alarming.
He quoted the census returns, showing
tnat 19 468 children, or 26 per cent of the
total of 74,840, have not attended any
school during the past ten months. He
says that the law is good and sufficient,
and calls the attention of the Board of
Education to the fact that it is required
by law that a notice of the law be pub
li>hed in a newspaper for three weeks in
June of each year.
Attention is also called to the'fact that
parents or guardians of children are liable
to prosecution for refusing to comply with
the law.
In bis resume of the financial situation
Mr. Webster told the board flatly and
plainly that he would not allow the
teacners' salaries to be held out during
his term as they hare in the past. This is
the way he handled the matter:
The practice of depriving teachers of their
prompt pay is at once pernicious, leading to
extravagauce and unjust to the teachers.
After June 30, while I am Superintendent, it
shall not occur. 1 will see to it that teachers'
and all salaries are paid first, and I will not
approve with my signature any demands for
one month exceeding in the aggregate one
twelfth of the entire appropriation for the
year.
1 claim that If my predecessor had exercised
this prerogative during the past six months ol
the fi cat year teachers would have been paid
promptly each mouth. The financial condi
tion of the department reveal* gross misman
agement in the past. You, gentlemen of the
Board of Education, inherited this deficit
from your predecessors.
Director Waller, chairman of your Finance
Committee, recently reported that It would
require $942,000 to pay salaries of teachers
for the yeur terminating June 30, 1898. If
teachers' salaries are to be withheld at the end
of this fiscal year, and in the present condi
tion of the School Department 1 can see no
way of avoiding itâ the Supervisors will be
obliged to appropriate for the payment of
teachers' salaries lor the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1898, $924,000, plus $38 for Novem
ber, plus an additional deficit at the end of
the ytar of over $100,000, making a total of
$1,062,000 against the salary account of
teachers, an amount of money far in excess ol
what was allowed by the Supervisors for the
present fiscal year for the conduction of the
department in all its branches.
This demand for teachers' salaries is rather
underestimated. It is a rank injustice to
teachers that this enormous sum should be
charged to them in the budget of the coming
year when it really covers up an < xtrttvagaut
expenditure for supplies, repairs, etc. In cold
print it is likely, unless explained, to mislead
the public and creates prejudice against
teachers' salaries. I consider it the duty of
this board to scale expenses for the next two
months to a minimum that the deficit that is
to bo charged to teachers' salaries mny be as
small as possible. I will refuse to approve any
unnecessary expense and favor the immediate
payment of $28,000 due the teachers on the
November salary account.
Superintendent Webster fays that he
does not intend to let the matters treated
of drop with a mere report, bnt will follow
them to the end.

HIS SECOND OFFENSE.
W. B. Bradbory, the Capitalist, Ar
rested for Expectorating in
â¢ Streetcar.
TV. 6. Bradbury, the capitalist, who
achieved notoriety recently by being the
first person arrested for violating the
ordinance against expectorating in street
cars, met with a similar experience on
Wednesday night.
He was riding on a Larkin-street car
going south about 7 o'clock and as it
neared Turk street he expectorated on the
floor. J. W. Greenlaw, the conductor,
called his attention to the card on the
side of the car drawing attention to the
ordinance and he alleges tbat Bradbury
replied: "I don't care a for the ordi
nance. I've been arrested once before
and yon can try it on acain if you like."
Policeman Sawyer happened to be on
Larkin street, between Turk and Golden
Gate avenue, and Greenlaw stopped the
car and called upon Sawyer to arrest Brad
bury for expectorating in the car. Sawyer
placed the capitalist under arrest and
booked him at the City Prison. He gave
$5 bail and was released.
For bin first offense Bradbury was fined
$5 by Judge Low, and the case is now
under appeal in the Superior Court.
Bradbury said last night that he was de
termined to fight the ordinance.
Sent Back to China.
Ah Joe, a Chinaman, was brought down
from the Folsom prison yesterday morning on
the expiration of his term of imprisonment
for embezzlement and was taken before
United States Commissioner Beacock, who
urdered him deported to China. Joe udmitted
that tie was born in China and under the law
Chinese convicted in this country of forgery
before November 3, 1893, must be sent back
to their own country.

THE SAM FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 14, 1 897.
TALENT ENJOYED
A PROFITABLE DAY
Four Choices Crossed the
Line First at Emery
ville.,.
Col. Wheeler Defeated Yankee
Doodle in a Great Big
Gallop.
_ . .
The Reman Receded in the Betting/
but Wonâ Cochran Took the
Last Event at Odds of 20 to I
Four favorites won purges at Emeryville
yesterday, and many of the Eastern
"hold-over contingent" secured get-away
money. The tracK was in good condition
and fair time was made in the different
event*.
A seren-furlong run for maiden three
year-olds opened the afternoon's sport
and drew oat a big field of nineteen start
ers. At post time Rosalbra and Kafaela
were equal favorites in the ring, either be
ing quoted at fours. The former, with
Patsy Freeman up, second to the stretch,
tuere headed Fiambeauettq and won at
the end, half a length in front of Cousin
Joe, al2to 1 chance. In a drive Twinkle
Twink took the show.
There was nothing of much account
starting in the mile and a sixteenth, and
Devault looked way and above the best.
Notwithstanding, 13 to 6 was always ob
tainable about him. J. Shields waited
with thi bay horse to the stretch, where
he cut loose and won easily from Coda,
in 1:49%. Fannie S, wtiich cut out the
pace, finished in the show. After oDening
a 2 to 1 favorite, Two Cheers receded to 5,
and was never heard of. g-
The Corrigan tally Truth wÂ« a luke
warm 13 to 5 favorite for the four and a
half furlong scramble for two-year-olds,
but did not carry a very heavy commis
sion. Milesio, a sturdy-looking colt by
imp. Order, was the good thing in the
race, and but for a tendency to jump
backward should have landed without
trouble. He shot through the bunch, and
overcoming a weakness to tire at the head
of the straight finished gamely, but could
not quite get up, and was beaten half a
length by the 5 to 1 chance, Socialist,
splendidly handled by Marty Bergen. Da
lion was a good third.
The Roman seemed to have the other
three starters in the mile purse at his
mercy, but a report was circulated that
he was stiff and sore, which caused his
price in the ring to recede from 1 to 2 to
4to 5. Rey del Tieria headed him until
well into the stretch, when he responded
to Figgott's urging and, without much to
spare, beat the Cambridge stable repre
sentative less tban a length in 1:42%.
Lost Girl downed Rienzi for the show.
Burns & Waterhouse had their colors
carried to the front in & big romp in the
fifth race, one mile and a -ixteenth.
Colonel Wheeler, with ninety-six pounds
up, ridden by Clawson, and a 9 to 10
chance around post time, madw a runaway
race of it, winning under wraps from
Yankee Doodle, the next in demand.
Ransom was a poor third.
Earl Cochran, a 20 to 1 chance, furnished
the surprise in the last event, over one
mile and a sixteenth, under selling con
ditions. When, as the stretcn was reached,
with Treachery, the second choice, in
front, it looked all over as to the winner,
H. Brown brought the long shot up and,
through a very sleepy ride on the part of
Clawson, who rode Treachery, won by a

Successful Benefit for One in St. Mary's
Hospital.
The benefit for the free ward of St.
Mary's Hospital at the Baldwin Theater
yesterday afternoon was a decided suc
cess. Long before the curtain rose the
house was crowded.
After the overture "William Tell," con
ducted by A. Hinnchs, the Tivoll opera
company and Dennis O'Sullivan gave the
second act of "Shamus O'Brien." They
received several curtain calls.
De Wolf Hopper's entrance was the sig
nal for a wild bnr*t of applause. lie
warbled a ditty about "Birr-r-dy" that
broueht down the houÂ»e. He good-na
turedly sang another, and was finally
forced to respond with his worJd-famous
"Casey at the Bat."
Joe Cawthorne did his side-splitting
German specialties in his u-ually clever
manner and was obliged to play his con
certina over and over ngain.
Ferris Hartraan followed, and here
again it waa the same old tale. The jolly
comedian bad hardly strength left with
which to get off the stage. Like Mr.
Hopper he was forced to give a recitation,
â¢â¢ the Chown's ji&by." Mr. O'Neil and
Mr. Page did some clever work. The
De Wolf Hopper company followed in the
finale of the second act of "El Capitan,"
and they were recalled and recalled.
The programme concluded with the
merry one-act comedy, "An Ur-to-Date
Maid," with Phoaa McAllister and Dr.
Frank Robinson in the cast.
DR. THORNTON
ARRESTED TWICE
His Heart Is Breaking
Through His Wife's
Desertion.
He Raised a Disturbance at Her
Father's House and Was
Given in Custody.
Released on Cash Bail He Was Later
Arrested and Booked for
Being Drank-
"Dr." Henry M. Thornton. 44 Bixth
street, since the episode of bis wife taking
poison the day after they were married
because she heard that he had a wife in
Chicago, has been keeping himself promi
nently before the public in different ways.
No sooner had his wife's attempt been
made public than the boy Kline's case
came into prominence, and following that
came the information that his wife bad
deserted him and returned to her parents.
Late Wednesday night he went to the
residence of his wife's parents on Folsom
street. He was under the influence of
liquor and wanted to get his wife to return
to him. He said he was in great distress
and his heart was breaking through love
for his darling.
Thornton re used to leave the house and
Moses Powell, his wife's father, bad him
arrested for disturbing the| peace. He
was release i on giving $20 carfh bail.
He turned up at the Receiving Hospital
about 2 o'clock yesterday morning in a
maudlin state. He waived to try his
powers as a hypnotist on Dr. Bunneil, but
was advised to get sober beiore making
any such attempt. Then he wanted to
get a bed for tho night in the male ward,
but this was sternly refussd.
Then he began to pour out his tale of
woe about his wife deserting him to all
who would listen to him. He complained
of his distress of mind caused by the loss

ARE UP
IN ARMS
Action of the Anti- Debris
Association Severely
Condemned.
BLOW AT A LEADING
INDUSTRY.
The Goodwin Ir junction Said to
Threaten the Whole Mining
Industry.
ALL THE MINES MAY BS SHUT
DOWN.
Julian Sonatas Declares the Matter
to Bs the Most Vital Now
Before the State.
The action of the Anti-Debris Associa
tion in suing out an injunction against
Jerry Goodwin of the Goodwin mine in
"evada County has stirred the deepest in
dignation of the miners of the entire State.
President Jacob Neff of the Miners' Asso
ciation has taken the field and proposes to
See to what length the Anti-Debris Asso
ciation is ready to go. Secretary Julian
:â¢ nntag says the question which this ac
: on brings before the court at Sacramento
:Â« the most important to tne people of
â  :ate now before any court or other
tribunal.
"It the injunction holds," said Mr.
Sonntag yesterday, "it means that the
Ami- Debris Association has it in its power
to shut down almost all the mines of the
State and we know enough of the disposi
tion of the men at the head of it to be
lieve they will attempt it."
The Goodwin mine is operated by
ground sluicing. The decision of Judge
>aivyer, rendered in 1884, was to the effect
that any person owning property on the
Sacramento, the Yuba or American rivers
might restrain, by injunction, any miner
whore wore contaminated or diverted the
flow of the waters of these rivers or any of
their tributaries. The decision was di
rected against a case of hydraulic mining,
but no class of mining was named in the
decision.
The Anti-Debris Association declared
that under tnis decision they could move
against an)' class of mining operation, but
that they did not thinK that quartz min
ing, drilling or ground sluicing were ma
terially injurious, and they would not dis
turb any but hydraulic mining.
The association at taat time particu
larly stated that it reserved the right of
enjoining any other class of mining upon
its being deemed injurious. The action
taken against the Goodwin mine is the
lirst step over tbe line under this threat
and has caused the almost panic in the
ranks of the miners.
"I tell you," said Secretary Sonntag,
"this love feast that has been so widely
advertised as being celebrated between
the miners and the farmers is all the
rankest kind of bosh.
"Under the act providing for the build
ing for the debris dams tne difficulties
complained oi will all be overcome, and
the miners, being permitted to wort with
out hindrance and embarrassment, will
increase tbe wealth of the State from
$6,000,000 to 18,000,000 annually. When I
traveled through the mountains of Ne
vada and portions of Placer County some
years ago I found a district dotted with
Â»he pretty homes of a prosperous people.
When I went over the same ground within
two years after the Sawyer decision the
de-olation I found there was enough to
make the heart sick. Property had been
laid waste to the value of $8,000,000.
"If the Anti - Debris Association at
tempts to act any role of that kind again
there *iil be trouble."
IN THE YELLOW HOUSE
Heads of Departments Await
ing the Christian En
deavor.
Nine Trans-Pccific Touris's Were Yes

Valley.
C. P. Huntinqton, president of the i
Southern Pacific Company, Is yet m San i
Francisco, occupying during business !
hours bis offices in the yellow building, j
His portrait, life size, is being painted by j
Fred Yates. Mr. Huntington has some i
notions about the use of beverages for !
stimulating purposes and fancies that the â 
time to begin their use is when a man
attains the age of 80. During t')e presi
dent's sojourn in the City the Junch hour
for heads of departments will not be
unduly prolonged.
Colonel C. X Crocker left the City for
New York last Wednesday evening. He
will not be absent a great length 01 time.

b. B. Douty of the Pacific Improvement
Company is in town doing business at

pleasure the expected visitof the Christian
Endeavor.
William Hproule, assistant general
freignt agent, notes with a resignation
iikin to satisfac'ion that the pencil crop
in Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and
Georgia is likely to be short and the yield
of California peach orchards considerably
above the average. lie reckons that the
fruit shipments this season will exceed
last year's haul. The regular business of
running special fruit trains will open up
early in June. Several carloads of cher
ries have already gone East from Vaca
ville. Cherries do not demand raj id tran
sit, but requie refrigerators.
Manager J. A. Fillmore is nol prepared
to give any estimate as to tlie number of
Christian Endeavorers that will attend the
convention. He noted, yesterday, how
pver, tbat a hundred conductors of the
New York Central Railroad were in town
and fancied that they were taking in the
Bights, such as Chinatown and the Cliff
House. The conductors' special left for
Los Angeles last evening.
At the Yo3emite office eleven passen
gers were booked for tne valley yesterday,
nine of them being trans-Pacific tourists.
A Christian Endeavor excursion, to last
for rive days, has been planned. The
Endeavorers will be able to do the valley,
goinir in one way and coming out another,
for $48 50. The excursion ticket covers
hotel and sleeping-car expense?, stage fare
and side trips. Tnis is the most favorable
Yosemite rate ever presented to the
public.

MRS. KEEGAN'S MONEY.
The Fight Over It Causes an Execution
to Be Issued Against tho Union
Trust Bank.
An execution was issued against the
Union Trust Company, a banking institu
tion at the corner of Montgomery and
Market streets, yesterday, as a result of
the corporation's participation in the suit
of Michael Keegan against John H. Kelly.
A Deputy csheriff sorved it during the
afternoon.
Keegan's wife died in October last ana
at his request Kelly was appointed ad
ministrator of the estate nf thedeceased.
Later the relatives of Keegan, who is
somewhat feeble-minded. Had Kelly re
moved and brought suit by Atiorney W.
G. Zeigier to recover sft2Uo, which had been
deposited in the Union Trust Company's
bank.
At the time Kelly was appointed ad
ministrator he was unable to furnish the
necessary bond 3 and by order of court
was aliowed to take ihe funds of Mrs.
Keegan out of the various banks in which

FOR THE UNEMPLOYED.
First Steps Taken in the Salvation
Army Colony Scheme.
The citizeng' colonization committee
appointea by the Chamber of Commerce
six week 3 or so ago met yesterday and
took the first steps on the line providing
work for the unemployed aÂ« suggested
by Maior W. W. VVinchell of the Salva
tion Army. Major Witichell desires to
secure a large tract of land to be cut up
into small holdings to be worked on a
system half communistic, half individual.
That is, the heavy machinery, water sup
ply, large farm tools, etc., to fee provided
and owned by the community, while the
land and improvements will" eventually
become the property of those who pay for
the same. He has received several offers
of large pieces of land.
The colonization scheme has hung fire,
so to speak, while the boulevard was
being constructed in order not to interfere
with that work, but now it is believed is
the proper time to make arrangements for
the new project. H. H. Sherwood, chair
man oi the committee, appointed a spe
cial committee consisting of j. J. Valen
tine, W. H. Bunker, L. R. Ellert, George
S. Montgomery and George F. butler to
make a thorough investigation of the
plans offered by Majjr Winchell, aid, if
found to be practical, to devise ways and
moans of putting the plan into operation.
Major Winchell will have his plans pre
pared within a few days.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 14, 1897.
THE "PENCIL" WILL
UNDER DISCUSSION
The Question as to Its Ad
t missibility in the Fair-
Craven Trial.
It Is Wanted by the Plaintiffs
to Bolster Up the Alleged
Alibi
Opposition to the Eocument by the
Defense Is Based Upon Purely
Legal Reasons
The so-called "pencil will which Mrs.
Nettie K. Craven produced after the death
of Senator Fair, and the date of which
shows that it was executed subsequent to
the "irust" will, is now the bone of con
tention in the Fair-Craven litigation.
The attorneys for the executors of the
Fair estate are extremely anxious, or at
least pretend to be â to prove this docu
ment to have been forged, as well as the
deeds over which this present suit is
about. It is plain that their object in at
tempting this is to establish some sup
port ;or their alleged alibi â the claim
that Senator .Fair was in San Rafael on
the 21th of September, 1894, and there
foie could noi hare been in this City at
the same time and delivered the deeds to
Mrs. Craven, and conld not have written
that will, as sue asserts he did. Their
contention is that if the will falls the
deeds must fall, too.
Tne defense is opnosing the introduc
tion of Chta class ot evidence on the ground
that ii is collateral, to say the most, and
more than that, is in no manner involved
as an issue in this proceeding to quiet
title to the disputed property. D. M. Del
mas denounced in scorching terms, yes
terday, tee insinuation emanating from
the other side that the defense shrank
from meeting an issue involving the "pen
cil" will. Simple rights under the law,
and a desire to avoid burdening the case
with immaterial and extraneous matter
was, he said, all that actuated his side in
opposing inadmissible evidence.
The argument on this proposition con
sumed tne major portion of the session
and is not done with yet. Judge black
did not compel the jurors to stay and
listen to it, us it was a. matter calling only
for a decision from the court â something
in which the jury could have no interest.
The aebate was inaugurated when It. B.
Mitchell, lor the plaintiffs, attempted to
put into evidence a magnified pnoto
graphic reproduction of the "pencil" will.
Judge Curtis of the defense wanted to
know wuat connection tne will had witn
the case, and inquired as to the purpose
of introducing the reproduction. After
some backing and tilling Mr. Mitchell ad
mitted that tne purpose was to prove, if
possible, that the will was not genuine.
That was what Judge Curtis had antici
pated, and he said he was prepared to
present an argument showing that the
will, whether good or bad, could not be
dragged Into this particular proceeding.
To begin with, the Judge cited the Cali
fornia Code of Civil Procedure and said
it pronounced the class of evidence
sought to be interjected as being wnolly
irrelevant in a case of this character. An
other point was that the plaintiffs had
not alleged the will to be a forgery in the
pleadings. He asked, as a matter of prin
ciple, whit benefit could Mrs. Craven
hope to gain by forging that will. She
was not named as a legatee therein. The
history of her life divulged the fact that
.she had always striven zealously with
Senator Fair to have him treat his chil
dren justly in hi> will. There was not. a
subpxion of selfishness as far as she was
concerned.
There was an old principle to be con
sidered, Judge Curtis said â a principle
older than Blackstone. Tnis was a require
ment that before a charge of forgery can
bo proved it must first be shown that the
forgery was intended to injure somebody
or that it was to benefit the author. The
eminent "will-smasher" of New York
then took occasion to rap expert hand
writing evidence on the head. He bad
had to do w.th a greal many cases in
court, he said, where this class of testi
mony predominated â in fact more so than
most other attorneys in the country. Ho
had followed litigation of this Kind in
twelve different Slates, and his experience
had forced him to tbe conclusion that,
with a few exceptional cases, the courts
were right when they expressed doubt and
suspicion regarding the testimony of
handwriting experts. He himself be
lieved it to be dangerous, indeed, and
something that s-hou.d be handled with
extreme care.
TaKing another view of the question
uuder discussion the Judge said that the
plaintiffs' counsel had not laid a proper
foundation for the introduction of this
evidence, but were going to make a great
show before the jury with their photo
graphs and wise-looking "professors," in
the hope of swerving opinions or raising
doubts.
"Their theory is that in desperate causes
they must appeal to the senses," said tha
Judge. "As was once said in a celebrated
homicide trial "they are going to convict
with the paraphernalia of the chemist.'
Suppose this pencil will is a forgery,
would that be evidence that the deeas
held by Mrs. Craven are not genuine?
Suppose, 1 say, the will is a forgery, does
that prove that the acknowledgments are
spurio'is? The moral struggle of the
plaintiffs here in this case is to prove that
the defendant, Mrs. Craven, is a criminal â
to prove also that Notary J. J. Cooney is
a criminal. But it is not going to be ac
complished by means of improper evi
dence if I am to be permitted to lift my
voice against it."
The Judge next read a number of au
thorities to show that evidence regarding
the pencil will was inadmissible even as
collateral evidence. The laws of England,
he said, were strict in prohibuing the
method of proving a person guilty of an
offense by means oi collateral evidence
showing that he had committed other of
fenses similar to the one charged. The
defense in this case, he said, was assing
for no merciful considerations. It would
be shown that Mrs. Craven's deeds were
valid and genuine. They would combat
the proof against this only for legal rea
sons.
Attorney Mitchell replied to the Curtis
argument. The sworn deposition of Mrs.
Craven had been introduced in evidence,
he said, and in it was the declaration that
on September 24, 1894, Senator Fair wrote
the pencil will in her house, and on the
same day handed her the disputed deeds.
Therefore, he held that ail of tbe docu
ments became part and parcel of the one
transaction, and one was as admissible as
evidence as the other. The attorney re
ferrert to United States Circuit Judge
Deady's decision in the celebrated Sharon
case, in which it was declared that it was
just as important tc prove the validity or
invalidity of tne "dear wife" letters a's to
establish the nature of the marriage con
tract.
Charles S. Whreler and Garret Mc-
Enerney followed Mr. Mitchell and cited
additional authorities tending to support
the plaintiff* claim?.
Then the defense was given another
turn, this time Mr. Delmt.s taking the
floor. He did not have an opportunity to
say much, however, being interrupted by
the arrival of the adjournment hour. But
he will open the proceeding* t.iis morning.

Work of the Lincoln Mon

ing Favorably.
Characteristic Letter on the Sub
ject From Naval 0-ficer
Irish.
How the Philosophy of the Martyred
President I flu. need His
Cabinet.
The executive committee of the Lincoln
Monument League met Wednesday night
at the headquarters of the G. A. R.,
President W. W. Stone presiding.
The committee on printing was author
ized to have a second issue of 20,000 certifi
cates in bocks printed and circulated. On
motion of Colonel C. Mason Kinne, nuar
ter-cards were ordered printed and placed
in various stores with snbscripiion-books
for the benetn of the general public.
Judge M. Cooney offered a resolution to
the effect that, "In order to prevent con
fusion and a possible misconception, no
organizations of any kind or nature be
permitted to give any entertainments in
the name of the Lincoln Monument
League without first obtaining tne sanc
tion of the executive board of the Monu
ment League committee."
The resolution was adopted.
The following letter from Naval Officer
John P. Irish was read':
In the apotheosis of Lincoln the actuai man
has been forgotten. Herndon's "Life of the
Emancipator" was severely criticized and, I
Believe, driven out of print. Yet it was proba
bly the best biography that has been pub
lished. It represented Lincoln as he was â a
man oppressed by the cares, influenced by the
environment, beset by the passions common
to us aH.
Such men are best seen in perspective. It is
then made plain that whiie they shared in all
the things that are allotted to men they drew
from the same elements different results. In
our mountains the Mnriposa tulip and the
giani Sequoia root in the same soil and grow
under me Fame sun, but with results how_
different! So itseems to.be with men. Out oi
common experiences one draws encourage
ment or caution ouly, while anothor absorbs
pniiosophy.
Lincoln was not spared in his own time.
Criticism and detraction were not left exclu
sively to his political opponents, but were
used without stint by leaders of his own
party. The combination of Senators Wade
and Henry Winter liavis and the awlul let
ters oi Murat Hal.stead were only a part el the
thorns planted in his path by hen<ls that
snould have plucked the briers out of his way.
During his lifetime nothing more untavora
bly affected his good name and standing as a
statesman than his reputation for story-tell
ing. Scarcely a week passed without the cir
culation oi a new story attributed to him.
More than twenty years ago, during a long
night journey with a gentleman who was a.
member of his Cabinet, I asked if the Presi
dent had deserved this reputation In reply
the ex-Cabinet Minister, Montgomery Blair,
said that while the repuutio-i was deserved
the country ill understood the reason of Lin
coln's lrcquent resort to story-telline. Hs sa'.d
that, as ah men remember whose memories go
back to that time oi potent passion, the Civil
War was an atmosphere in which all the
greeds and grudges, rival ambitions and com
petitive spites of men grew with an orchid
luxuriance. Avarice, pride of positiou, iust
ior authority, desire for revenge, alÂ» flourished
in that high aud mighty time, alongside of
patriotism and sell-sacrifice, of sorrow and
heroism.
All oi these emotionÃ, good and bad, were to
a peculiar degree focused in the Cabinet. At
nearly every meeting of that body, from 1861
to 1865, its deliberations took their tone irom
the clamor of mixed passions which distorted
the country like en epidemic chorea.
The result was always a contention, the
deepening of fenllng into a refusal to compro
mise or accommodate, and practically a
cassation of business. The President never
mixed in these contentions nor sought to con
clude them by taking sides or suggesting a
compromise, bat always sat, his face express
ing iho profoundest melancholy and sadness
and his eyes seemine; to look upon scenes tar
off, while his mind was apparently away
among things unseen by thuse around him,
and he seemed listening to voices that rose
maybe lrorn battles in action or soDbedover
llelds thÂ«t had been fought. When his
warring Cabinet had disputed itself into inac
tion, and every man scowled with anger upon
every other, the President's face would begin
to light up, mind and senses would appear to
arrive from their far excursion and a smile
would twinkle in his eyes as ha would say,
"V\ hiit Mr. Secretary said reminds me of,"
perhaps it would be something in Sangamon
County, but wherever located the story was
quite sure to be taken from the lives and lines
of the plain people among whom his life had
t.ein. It was sometimes risque and always
irres slibly funny, and tickled the ribs of the
Cabinet until every member roared. In that
explosion of good huiior evil temper evapo
rated and directly the matter that had caused
the deadlock would be disposed of, usually as
suggested by the President, and his official
family would separate in (food feeling and go
iv buoyant spirits to their several duties.
Mr. Blair said that Stanton was a peculiarly
saturnine roan and given to brusqueness in
his official contacts-. One Cabinet day he and
Blair met on the steps of the Wnite House, and
after saluting Blalr'said, "Well, I suppose we
will get another story to-day." Stanton faced
him with a severe expression, and uttering an
oath said, "I have listened to the last levity I
will bear from the President. V\ ith the coun
try's life flowing to waste from every pore and
the whole land a sepulchre 1 will stand no
more idle stories."
"They entered the Cabinet-room and wh-in
business was attempted there ensued an un
usually violent scene, with the President in
his unual neutral attitude and the picture of
profound saducss. When the deadlock came
his face lit up and he began a story. Stanton
rcse, folded his papers and started from the
room, but paused and stood looking out of the
window across the Potomac fiats. At the cli

Dr. Sanden's ; Electric; Belt has been used successfully in such cases for many years.

max of the story his sides were shaking and
he returned to hjs seat and business proceeded
pleasantly.
Now, this was not levity in Mr. Lincoln. It
was philosophy. He had seen toe effect of
humor upon men on the frontier. He had
heard it used by the pioneer preacher in camp
meetings. He 'had tried it before juries and
on the stump, not from a fondness for levity,
but as a means of best controlling men. And
he found statesmen and scholars in his Cabi
net made of the same clay as his neighbors in
Southern Illinois and moved them by the
same means. Mr. B:air said that looking back
to those scenes it was perfectly plain to him
that by no other means could the President
have exorcised the pawionsof his Cabinet and
concluded the public business.
All this I tell as it was told to me by an actor
in those scenes. It causes men to reflect upon
how little we know of the motives which are
behind the acts of public men who bear great
responsibilities. John P. Irish.
STOCKTON'S GIANT GREW.
Why the Champion Oarsmen of the
Joaquin Will Not Sow
at Â£1 Campo.
The giant crew of the South End Row
ing Club will not have the pleasure of
measuring oars with the big men of the
Stockton Rowine Club on June 20 at Ei

many rumors that are afloat, the South
enders will not have easy paddling on the
day or the regatta, as there is a very prom

clubs which ma/ givo the swift-rowing
oarsmen of the South Ends a grueling race
from start to finish.

Athletic Association has no crew in training,
and the Giants have been weakened by the re
cent departure of the eiaat, Carl Davis, for
Montana. They could still put in a splendid
crew, but there are other reasons for the barge

tranclsco clubs to send their crews to El
Campo. Tnen -we were there three days, and
the weather was so bad that the races were
postponed and we were forced to go back again
and row it off at Long Bridge. Just now we
are not in a position to repeat this experience.
We hare no feeling against the other clubs,
except that we do not think that the South
Ends treated us exactly right before. When
they had their regatta they agreed to come
here on the Fourth of July ii we would go to the
expense of going below, Dut they did no:,
and then again tuey acted rather shabbily by
not rowing in the last Thanksgiving regatta
in Oakland Creek.
"These, however, are not the reasons for our
not entering, as the main cause is that \.e can
not po 10 the expense of sending a crew below
and finding the weather such that we cannot
row the r;ico at the time called. We are in for
all km. is of sport, but with a club like ours we
have got to consider ways and means."
OPPERMANN BACKS OUT.
Does Not Now Want to Sell
His Body to the Board
of Health.
Says Tbat His Wile Objects and That
the Publicity Hurts His
Business.
Wilhelra Oppermann, the despondent
teecher of the zither, who offered to sell
liis body when his immortal part bad left
it for the use of medical men, has re
pented, and his reasons were tet forth in a
letter to Secretary Godchaux of the Board
of Heaitu, which wa9 read at the meeting
yesterday. He wrote as follows:
To the Secretary of the Board of Health, San
Francuco. Mr. Godchaux â Dear Sir: Some
people say there Is no danger Bny more now
adays to te interred alive. You will see in
The Morning Call from to-day, May 12. in a
large c lumn, thtit a mnn by the name of
Frank Mi Dermott in Boston, Mass., wascon-
Mdered by a half a dozen physicians which
made a perfunctory examination of the body,
was pronounced for dead, and that in a short
time after he was alive and went to work
again. I am afraid to be interred alive and
that is the principal reason I came to you.
But as my wife objects now to sell my body
and it looks that I lose all my pupils I have to
wait and am not going to make a petition to
the Board of Health now, but later I will see
you again. I did not expect to have so much
talk in all the papers. It hurts my business
awful now. I ?ee you later. Respectfully,
Wilhelm Oppebmann, Teacher oi Zitfier,
29 Julian avenue.

Explanation.
Tbe arrow flies with tbe wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it. if any . tin; amount of
rainiall, of melted suow in inches and hundredths,
during tbe past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect po.'n s of e.qual air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word â¢â¢hieh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually aceomoanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompnnied by cloudr weather 'and rain*.
"Lows" usi.ally first a|>|n-Â«r on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coas:, and the Isobars extend
north and south alonz the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "hick" in the vie nlty of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
wili produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK, N. V.. May 13.-The reactionary
tendency of the stock market was accentuated to
day by advices fiom Washington indicating that
there is a more serious phase in the general situa
tion in Cuba, in so far as bis country may become
involved. Advices in this respect were not re
ceived until the aittrnoon, but upon their general
dissemination the market sold off rapidly and ral
lied very feebly at the close. Tnere was practi
rally no other influence In the day's market, for
with the correction of the extravagant estimates
as 10 (he shipment of gold on Saturday the bear
room-traders were left without much speculative
ammunition, which probably accounts for the
avidity with which they seized upon the revival
of the Cuban question. One million dollar* In cola
has been en.at;e â¢ lor export Saturday, a jd at least
as -much in addition is expected to be taken to
rnoirow, but the actual shipments still fall far be
low the general Stocc Exchange estimates or the

FOR ONE BUG
A Possibility of the New
Horticultural
Act.
Many Orchardists B?lieve That
Its Constitutionality May
Be Attacked.
The Commission I; Its Owi Auditor
and Is Responsible to
Noboiy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
9(b Broadway, May 13. f
Statements are eing made by some or
chaniisis in this county that the new law
pr< riding for Horticultural Commissions
is clearly unconstitutional, inasmuch at
the n.embers are not made responsible to
anybody for their work. While ii is gen
eraliy admitted that tne act is a great im
provement on the old law, so far as means
cave been provided for lorcing the or
chavdists to attend and care for their
property, it is also said that the con*rnis
sion holds a position absolutely inde
pendent, which makes it en unconstitu
tional measure.
The Commissioners are not subiect to
the dictations of the Board of Supervisors,
either in what they do or what they leave
undone. All that the Supervisors can do
is to collect and pay ail the bills and look
cheerio!. It is provided that each mouth
an itemized report must be filed with the
Board of Supervisors, failing to make
which the Commissioners' salaries may
be withheld, but it is not provided 'hat
the accounts of the Commissioners shall
be audited by anybody save themselves,
or that the Board of Supervisors can chal
lenge any item of expenditure.
One of the local orcharding has said that
a Commissioner may spend a who^e da>"
killing one bug, for which the county can
not refuse lo pay him ?4.
Tne only power that can investigate the
new commissions is the Grand Jury. A
Commissioner cannet be unseated except
for cause, on petition of twenty-live or
chaniists, aud if the Supervisors should
not desire lo remove him twenty-five
orchsrdists would have a big task in prov
ine cause.
It is provided also that each Commis
sioner Â«hall receive $4 per day and travel
ing expenses, but no one but the Commis
sioner himself is the judge of when h?
shall wort and when he shall not. After
dividing the county into districts, the
Commissioners appoint a local inspector
at a salary of $'2 50 per day. These ex
penses provide fjrau annual expenditure
oi $6084. independent of mileage and trav
eling expenses, so that the Horticultural
Commission of Alame.'a Cnunty will prob
ably cost the coun ty f 10,000 per year.
While it it not contradicted that to in
â¢ure freedom from pests and general rav
ages in orchards this sum is not too large,
it is freely contended that Commissioners
should not be permitted to incur this
amount of debt in "-tich an iiresponsible
manner as is provided by the new act.
In this county the three members are all
men o; experience, in whom t!je various
districts have absolute confidence. They
took office on the Ist of this month and
organized into three districts, ns rt quired
by law. Under the circumstances me re
ports of the Commissioners 'or this month
are being awaited with much curiosity.
Tno first orchard ist or oilier person
coming in conflict with the new boara by
refusing to carry out its orders will surely
brins? the matter before the courts and try
to determine the constitutionality of the
law.
ON THE ANXIOUS SEAT.
No Break of the Deadlock in the Boaiil
of Work*.
OAKLAND, Cal., May IS.â There is still
great doubt as to when changes may be
made in the head of the Fire and Street
departments.
City En-:neer Clement stated to-day his
reasons why he wished to turn out Fire
Chief Fair and Street Superintendent
M ilier yesterday. "Although 1 am not a
Democrat," said Cement, '1 was elected
on the Democratic ticket and I believe
the party is entitled to some recognition
from me. I wi'-h to put Nick Bnll in as
Chief of the Fire Department. He is a
Democrat and competent to fi.l the posi
tion. It is well known whether Chief
Fair is competent or not. I wished to put
a Democrat at the head of one department
am! the other Commissioners hai virtu
ally given me the Fire Department. This
was not said in so many words, btu it
was understood. Of course, neither Mayor
Thomas nor Mr. Djw can be exp'cted to
vote for a Democrat, but I shall insist
upon getting one in."
The position is now getting more com
plicated than ever, and programmes are
being made and broken between each
meeting of the board. There are three
departments and three Commissioner?,
and it has generally been the rule for each
commissioner to handle one department.
At this lime there does not seem to be
any desire to remove the Chief of Police
on the part of any one, and yet r.either of
the Corami-sioners is anxious to be tbe
one to lose his privilege on behalf oi the
Chief of Police.
The strongest political friends of Mayor
Thomas have evidently determined uiat
Fred Campbell shall be the next Chief of
the Fire Department, and until this de
termination is relinquished there will be
dissatisfaction and unpleasantness in the
Bosh l of Works.
Clement Will certainly not be permitted
to turn the P'ire Department over to the
Democrats, and he in turn is evidently
determined that Mayor Thomas shall not
get his wav, and with the third Commis
sioner, Dow, contented with thines as
they are and unwilling to vote with
either, the present demoralized condition
cf the Fire Dei artraent will continue.
Every few days t:e lack o r discipline in
Ihe men under Chief Fair is made more
more and more apparent, and ausppn
bions are becoming very common. The
Chief has been criticized so severely for
his apparent lacK of competency at recent
tires that the men have evidently made
\ip tlieir minds that there is to be a
change, and are showing the indifference
thai can be reasonably expected under
Fiich circumstances.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FKIUAY, MAY 14, 1897.
THE LUCKIEST
SAILOR IN PORT
Johnson Fell From Aloft,
but a Boat Could Not
Find Him.
Discovered Unconscious in the
Fooiropes of the Main
Yard.
When He R ached the Deck H â¢ Roll d
Into the Arms of the
Mate.
Oakland Ojeice San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, May 13. j
One of the most remarkable escapes ever
chronic ed on a sea voyage is that of
Henry Johnson, an able seaman on board
the suid Occ dental, now unloading at
Franklin-street wharf.
During the recent voyage of the vessel
from Departure Bay to Oakland heavy
weather was met with off Cape Mendo
cino. Johnson was aloft passing the upper
topsail-reef earring ou the weather yard
arm when a sudden lurch caused him to
iose his hold.
The accident happened just as darkness
was coming on, and instantly the cry of
"Man overboard 1" was raided. First Offi
cer Welling at once rushed to the port
lifeboat and proceeded to lower the boat
into the water. They pulled around in the
heavy sea for a few minutes, bnt could
find no trace of Johnson, neither could
the man who kept a lookout from the
mizzen-top see anything, as it was bo
dark.
As the boat was returning to the ship
one of the sailors happened to look aloft,
and to his surprise he saw Johnson en
tnneled in the foot- ropes of the main yard.
He bad not fallen into tne water, but had
struck on the main yard and become en
tangled in the gear in a manner that was
simply miraculous. The force of the fall
bad rendered him unconscious, and n
couple of men were running aloft to re
lease aim and bring him down when an
other roil of the ship dislodged nim from
the foot-ropes, throwing him against the
weather rigging, at the foot of which was
n. e male standing near the davit from
which the boat had just been lowered.
Johnson simply rolled down the shrouds
and ratlines into the arms of the mate,
who wa3 waning to receive him.
He was taken in the cabin, where a little
eood whisky revived nim, and, with the
exception of a bruise on the head, he was
no worse for his fall. When the crew was
paid off, Johnson was considered such a
lucky man that the captain induced him
to sign tor another voyage.
To Help the Cigar Trade.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 13 âThis even

The first number, Beethoven's sonata,
Op. 31, No. 3. E flat major, was well done,
particularly the presto movement. But
it was in the r nderins of Chopin's ".Bal

KIND ETHIOPIAN WOMEN.
A Touching Tribute to the Worth of the
Abyssinian <>l the Cientler Sex.
Major Garjierra, who was made prisoner
at the battle of A'iowa, and whose hair
lurntd completely white with his suffer
ings while in Abyssinia, has published a
book giving an account of the ten months
of his captivity. He pays a feeling and
Genuine tribute to the Abyssinian women.
The Ethiopian womnn is obliged to work
hard all day, hewing wooil and drawing
water, grinding iho gram and preparing
the household food. To the men is re
served the taste of sewing and weaving,
whicn tney are very clever at.
The customs of the people are quite
patriarchal, the head of the family being
often like a Sultan in the miniature, with
a small harem of slaves. The legitimate
wife, if she protests at tall, does so meekly,
as women, even in that part of Africa, are
considered little better than beasts or bur
den, and the Copt relieion as it is under
stood, especially among the Amhara, has
not the power to raise her from hpr state
of Inferiority. Major Gamerra paints a
picture truly touching of the tenderness to
suftering and the charity and self-sacrifice,
which are not found in isolated cases, bui
are general among these downtrodden
souls. He speakÂ« of a certain Kongeitu,
| an ol I and ugly * Oman, who was an angel
j of char tv to many of the prisoners, but
i especially to t&Â« major. She shared their
! sadnes*, she gatbere l and prepared the
primitive medicines of herbs n^ed there,
and when she saw them depressed used to
cr_v"A<:ari! Agnri!" (Italy ! Italy !) add
111Â° thai Meueliic was good and would free
I ihe ro.
When she understood that in Italy
there were mo:hers, wives and sisters
weeding lor them she began to cry, and
they in turn were ih* comforters. The
first woman Maijr Gamerra met was
when his feet were all cut and bleeding,
owing to marching without shoes, *o that
lie was in extreme pain. Sellas, a poor
slave of Rus Workie, seeing his sufferings,
took the white linen she wore from her
head, divided it into two pieces and ban
daged his feet. This was an act of real
self-sacrifice, as such a piece of linen in
Schna and Goggiam is a precious treasure.
It wns al: the more wonderful that a slave
should make such a sacrifice for a
strancer, and he a captive. After ten
months the day at last came for Major
Gamerra to leave !or Italy. He rose early
and vent to take leave of his true friends.
Kongeitu was ill. Bhe showed lierselt and
really was glad at his liberation ; but when
the moment of partine came she could
not conceal her Ditter grief.â Pall Mall

as many notes of an octave. The other
two notes were nissinir, but might hare

City to tbe party addressed. In 1891 he
was secretary of Council No. 60 of the
Chosen Friends, and I succeeded him in
the cln c. As it was a letter referring to
official business it came into my pos
session a few days since. WLere it has
been I do not know, and I doubt if any
one can explain."
An examination of the envelope shows
that it bears the imprint of tec Supreme
Council, Order of Chosen Friends, with
the injunction "If not delivered in 7 dayÃ
return to T. B. Linn, Supreme Recorder,
Indianapolis, Ind." Across the postage
stamp is the cancelling mark nnd the
date, "Indianapolis, April 24, 12:30 P. *Â"
and between the canceling mark and the
date mark are the figures "91."
The letter within the envelope bears
date of April 24, 1891, and is add res ed
"Jonn Prentiss, secretary Golden Gate No.
60 of California," while on the envelope is
the address of Mr. Prentiss, 1407 Sacra
mento street. On the back of the en
velope there is the San Francisco receiv
ing mark, "San Francisco, Cal., April 28, 2
p. M., 1891, received A." It also bears these
additional marks: "San Francisco, Apr.
29, 6 a. M. 1897, Cal. 1 '; San Francisco,
Apr. 29, 5:30 P. m., 97 E," and "San Frnn
ci-ico, Cal., reed Sia. C, Apr. 30, 12 M., 97."
It. is probable that the letter in the dis
tribution six years ago fell behind some
box and lay undisturbed until acci
dentally discovered a few days ago. This,
however, goe^ to show that when Uucle
Sam gets a letter properly addressed he
will deliver it, even if it does take him six
years to do it

tltioner of Boston, together with Julius M.
Swain, W. O. Robson and six others met and
formed the first council of the Royal Arcanum.
They first met on May 20, 1877, and on June
123, a month later, tney organized, and lrom
tnat humDle beginning the order which they
Etarted \\i;li many doubts has grown Into an
organization covering the whole conntry and
having a membership of nearly 200.000. Dar
ing its twenty years it has met with the stme
reverse* which all orders have had, but it has
lived through all its periods of depression and
now that its anuivenary is at hand the memb
erse rs feel that nothing short of a great celebra
tion will do them.
AU through the United States May 20 will
be observed with special ceremony by every
town that has a council of the order. Boston
is making great preparations, for aside from
having the Twentiem Supreme Council ses
sion it will Have a union celebration of some
30,000 members in that city alone, which
number will be l&-ge'y sdded to by outside
visiting members. Arrangements have been
made end from different parts of thecountrr
bands of excursionists are going there for
Arcanum day. Here in San Francisco there
will be a number of folks who cannot leave at
this time, but just the same they Vropose to
celebrate in their own way.
Argonaut Council, which has been here
thirteen years, and Golden West Council, just
organized, have engaged Native Sons' Hall,
and on MHy 20 propose having a big ball and
celebration generally.
Colonel J. J. Tobin, one of the oldest mem
bers in the order and one of the many promi
nent members of it, will be the speaker of tne
occasion. A fine programme has been ar
ranged. There will be dancing, etc. Nearly
2000 invitations nave been issued and it ih ex
pected that a lot more will have to be sent out.

The council at its last meeting adopted a reao
lution wishing him a prosperous and suc

The Starr King Rouge of Representatives con
vened last Tuesday and held an Interesting

argument. The special order before the house

the belligerency of Cuba, which will meet
strong opposition from the minority.

APOLLO-LIKE EAEL.
Son of â¢ Poet, Handsome, Graceful and
a Heciuse.
1 He has the eyes of a seraph and the
manners of an archangel, and of such are
the kingdom of heaven," wrote a'brilijant
woman apropos of her first meeting with
the Earl of Crewe at an English house
party. "I came away," she continues,,
"in a state of mind that would under
mine ihe strongest constitution, if per
sisted in, for he is the most beautifulâ l
am sure he must be the most beautiful
Enrl in the world."
Wi-atever this "state of mind" of the
clever correspondent may have been it is
by no means peculiar to herself, but it is
a sort of epidemic that has spread through
London society, and there is no ennmer
atinc tue constitutions that are to-day
suffering from its fatal influence, for
England does not contain a more destra
tie party than Sir Richard Monckton
Milnes, Lord Houghton, Karl ff Crewe.
Not that he is so Â«-normousiy rich as for
tunes are now reckoned, but he has title,
distinction, character, culture, charm, ex
traordinary manly beauty and many other
delightful qualities, any one of which is
sufficient to awaken flutter mga in the femi
nine heart.
His father was the celebrated Richard
Monckton Milnes, Lord Hougbton, called
the most agreeable man in London â bril

a constant patron of tbe arts and the
friend of every struggling genips. It
will always be leruembeied to his honor
that he was tbe warm personal friend and
admirer of Kents, and if it had been in his
povrer would have changed the face of thÂ«
world for that stricken young poet.
The Earl of Crewe does not figure in the
social and literary world to the same ex
tent as his father, bat when specially
called upon comports himself with the
most grace and tact.
Three years ago a number of Americans
witu literary tastes wished to place in
Hampstead, where Keats once lived, some
sort of & monument to bis memorr. They
had a beautiful bust executed, which was
presented by Edmund Day and received
by Edmund Gosse. The ceremony was a
charming affair. Walter Besant gave a
luncheon, at which were present Dv
Manner, Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett,
Thomas Hardy, Lecky and many other?,
among them Lord Houghton, who had
been asked to make a speech for his father,
who was then not living.
As he ro^e to speak one quite forgot
Keats, the occasion â everything except
tbe physical perfection of the man who
stood there, superbly tall, of magnificent
figure, Greek face, with regular features,
lovely shadowy, sand-brown eyes, and
long, abundant mustache. Afterward one
forgot the man in the exquisite taste of
his achievement. He succeeded in en
tirely obliterating his own personality,
and with the most dignified modesty spoke
quite simply in his father's name.
Sir Richard inherited the title of Lord
Houghton from his father. His uncle,
Baron Crewe, being a bachelor, left no
heirs, and his estate and the title also de
scended to the present Lord Houghton,
who was next in kin.
When very young Lord Hough ton mar
ried the daughter of a baron and an ex
quisitely lovely young woman. I heard
Lady Fnzgerald once say that sitting in
the ladies' gallery of the House of Lords
one day she suddenly looked up and saw
before her a young woman whom she
thought the most beautiful creature she
had ever seen ; but while watching her sho
was joined by a young peer who was in
every way as beautiful as herself. These
were none other than Lord Hough ton and
his wife.
For seven years they lived together the
most perfectly harmonious life. With
tastes absolutely congenial tbey were di
vinely happy. Then death came to the
lovely Sibyl, and for five years after
nothing could rouse the slightest interest
in the desolated peer. He was left with
three little girls and one boy. Two years
after his wife's death he lost his only son
and heir.
His eldest daughter, still a young girl,
is called Annabel. Then there are the
twins, one blonde the other brunette â
Lady Cynthia and Lady Celia. The Earl
of Crewe adds to all that education can do
fora man a vein of original thought and
fancy. He has published a volume of
stray verses called "From 1880 io 1889,"
which are very well known in London.
One of them, entitled "Seven Years," is a
charming poem and, of course, reminis
cent of his supremely happy years. â 8u

Jenny Llnrt's Last Pnblic Appearance.
"The last time Jenny Lind sang in pub
lic was on July 23, 1883, in the Spa, Mal
vern Hills, England," writes Mrs. Ray
mond Maude, daughter of the "Swedish
Nightingale," in the Ladies' Home Jour
nal. "The concert was in aid of the Kail*
way Servants' Benevolent fund, and it
was a red-letter day indeed to the country
folk who came from all the country round
with the modest eighteen pence, which
secured them standing room. On one of
my walks, during the last sad week I
helped to nurse her, I found an old woman
in a remote cottage who eagerly asked for
the 'good lady who was so ill up there.'
Upon finding who I was she assured me
that it would have Deen worth even more
stinting and a further walk to have bad
such a treat in her old age as that singing."
The whiskers of the walrus extend three
or four inches out from the snout. They
are quite stiff, and become sliffcr with
age. They are plucked separately and
exported to China, where they are used as
toothpicks.

Expert Cyril Williams of the Board
of Supervisors has finished his ex

Water Company's books, made to
assist in the board's deliberations
over the water question, and has pre

The inference to be drawn from the
document is that the cut in rates, if any
is made, must be a horizontal one, for the
figures required by the board to make dis
criminations cannot be obtained without
an outlay of time greater than the board
has at its disposal.

the name of each rate-payer in alpha
betical order and a statement showing in
detail the aggregate amount collected
from each source of revenue under differ
ent charges for the several items em
bodied in the general rates, special rates
and meter rates. Â
The following Is the gist of Mr. Wil
liams' report:
If, instead oi charging up each bill in one
entry, as above, forty or fifty columns had to
be ruled in the ledgers to cover each item In
the schedule, nnd entries made accordingly, it
wouid entail the posting of several hundred
thousands of entries each month and the em
ployment of many times the number of men
now in use.
Take for example a row of houses belonging
to one person supplied 1 y one pipe, some one
Btory, some two story, stables, etc.â twenty or
thirty different item* on the bill. An allow
ance of $10 is made on a payment on account
received. A percentage of this amount would
have to be deducted lrora each amount or
there would have to be a corresponding credit
column for each item in the schedule, 'ibis
system would, of course, be possible, but, in
my opinion, quite imprHCticable, ana I think
it "would be difficult to improve on the present
method of keeping accounts of collections.
With regard to keeping personal accounts,
showing receipts irom each individual, this
is another matter that would entail an im
mense amount of labor. According to the
company's statement, their sepii rate consum
ers consist of 58.305 famili.'*. 18.481 places
of business, representing 76,786 accounts,
with an average of 500 to 000 accoun s to be
opened each month because of a change of
occupancy. In addition to these would be
143 accounts for public buildings, parks and
squares. Another difficulty would be that a
new tenant frequently pays a bill made out
in the i-ame ot nis predecessor. The amount
charged to every house appears clearly on tne
company's record-book of applications, and
from their book b\ many months of labor au
itemized statement of every charge on the
t>cnedule could be obtained, subject to, per
haps hundreds of changes during the time of
making it up.
In conclusion I would state that with the
means Â»t hand the furnishing of a correct ac
count of itemized receipts would be impracti
cable, as would also the keeping of ledger ac
counts so as to show the actual separate re
ceipts irom each tenant, occupant or owner.
In January, I^o7, the company was supply
ing 58,305 f*aiu;hÂ«->, 18,481 places oi business.
143 public parks, buildings and squares and
â  'â -.â¢<'â¢ tire hydrants.
Tne dwei ling-bouses were divided as follows:
One-story. 15,014; two-story. 23,039; three
story, 5385; four-story, 217; live-story, 5.
Total, 43,060.
The company also supplies 3000 buildings,
such as hotels, boarding and lodging nouses,
office buildings, etc.
Of the dwellings 8434 have a general rate of
50 cents or less. Families with a general rate
oi 50 c^nts or less number 13,853.
There are 16,651 bills amounting to $2 or
less per month.
Water was delivered by hose cart to 703
vessels lying at water front from July 1 to

AN EXPERT IS AT WORK.
H. A Williams N w on His
Way Here From Sydney,
Australia.
S. Prentiss Smiib. Says There Are
Thus Far No Surprisesâ Other
Firms Implicated-
An expert is industriously working on
the books and accounts of Williams,
Brown <Â£ Co., the firm which failed Tues
day for something like $51)0,009, and with
assets may be of $200,000. He is going
inio all the details ot the business of the
firm, and will make a full report, which
will be handed the creditors at as early a
day as possible.
S. Prentiss Smith of the Bank of Cali
fornia, one of the committee of four ap
pointed by the creditors, told Wednesday
of the work of tbe expert employed by the
committee and what he anticipated.
"There are a lot of accounts to go over, "
said he, "and the expert accountant will
probably not be able to get at the inside
of the business and make a report before
Saturday. As soon as he is ready the
committee will take up the report.
"No revelations have yet been made of
an astonishing character. The expert has
seen nothing to change the statement
made by Mr. Than^ for tne firm. I know
nothing of any $200,000 claim by Mr. Wil
liams' father against ihe firm."
H. F. Fortman, president of the Alaska
Packers' Association, one of the creditors,
also said that nothing had thus far been
found to indicate any chance from the
statement rendered. "We take it that it
is correct," said he, "in a general way.' 1
A. Powell of the Bank of British Colum
bia, one of the committee, claimed to
have no information at all about the failed
firm.
It is stated in some quarters that the es
timated value of the assets is far too hiph.
and that in place of being worth $200,000,
they are probably not worth over half
that. It is also said that four smaller
companies encaged in the packing busi
ness, and dependent on the big firm that
has inil*Â»d, ara liable to go to the wall.
A. F. Thane, who, in the absence of H.
A. Williams, is in chaige of tbe business,
on Sunday received this cable from Mr.
Williams at Sydney :
Sailing on Mariposa on Monday; telegraph

R. Hickmott of the Hickmott Canning
Company of Oakland wishes to deny that
his farm is endangered by tbe failure. He
states that his company is running as
usual.
A THIEVING BOOTBLACK.
Mike Brath Robbrd a Customer While
Brushing Hia Coat.
Mike Brath, a boot black, 17 years of age,
was arrested last nU'ht by Detectives Gib
son and Wren and PoliCAman Harrison
on a charge of grand Jarceny.
On Tuesday afternoon James Hanley, a
dry-goods merchant of Oakland, was at
the ocean beach, and Brath asked him to
take a shine, telling him a pitiful story of
being hungry for days.' Hanley was
touched |by his tale and allowed him to
shine his boots, giving him 25 cents for
doing so.
While Brath was brushing Hanley'*
coat he deftly abstracted his sold watch,
valued at $250, and $70 in gold. Photog
rapher Kenneth at me beach saw Bra.a
take the watch and gave chase. He over
took him and compelled him to give up
the timepiece. Neither he nor Hanley
knew that the $70 had been taken, and
Hanley did not discover the loss of his
money till he put bis band in his pocket
to pay for his car fare.

A KNOCK-OUT
BLOW FOR
HEBBARD
Marriott Acquitted of
the Charge of
LibeL
UNANIMOUS VERDICT
IN HIS FAVOR
Stinging Rebuke Administered to
Unscrupulous Professional
Politicians*
THE ATTEMPT TO INVOKE GAG
LAW FAILS.
S* M* Shortridge's Brilliant and Successful
Plea for the Constitutional Rights of
Press and Citizens*
Judge Hebbard, be of tbe many initials
and unsavory connection with the pro
fe s-ional politicians that manipulated tbe
affairs of the People's Home Savings
Bank, has come back to earth.
His arrogance has received an ugly re
buke, and tbe desperate attempt be has
made to throttle criticism of his record
and actions on the bench has come to au
inglorious end.
It is not libel to say that he is a dis
grace to the bench. A standard by infer
ence of his merit for that high position
has been set down by the verdict of the
jury which acquitted Editor Marriott last
night of a charge of libeling him.
For weeks he has been making one of
the most desperate attempts in the history
of the State to invoke the law of gag.
The thousands of depositors in the sav
ings bank, who charged him with being
morally responsible for the losses they
snstained, have had their vindication.
Tbe men who were bold enough during
the last campaign to fearlessly oppose his
candidacy, and whom he has since en
deavored to send to jail on charges of
criminal libel, have the satisfaction of
knowing that their work has not been in
vain.
A great deal of mystery that surrounded
the affairs of the savings bans has been
dissipated. The jugglery and manipula
tion of tbe ring in control and a Judce's
true connection with it is finally known.
The "holier than thou" toga of Julius
Caesar Bonaparte Hebbard has been pulled
aside, and, after all, it is a very common
man within it â one to whom no one of
twelve men could find it in his heart to
afford the balm ol a disagreement.
The case went to the jury at half-past 4
o'clock yesterday afternoon, and three
hours later a decision had been reached.
Judge Daingerfield, however, was at the
theater, and it was almost midnight be
fore it was finally delivered to the court.
The Hebbard push, which was out in
big numbers, at once put on crape.
A big throng saw the closing scenes,
among whom were many attorneys.
General Barnes and other legal heavy
weights looked in to get some pointers on
oratory, of which there was plenty. The
feature of the proceedings was the bril
liant and masterly address of Mr. Short
ridge on behalf of free speech and the
right of voters to criticize candidates
for office, and his stinging yet dignified
indictment of Hebbard and his friends in
relation to the affairs of the savings bank.
The case began at 9 o'clock and it was
5 before it got to the jury.
In opening Mr. Shortridge spoke as
follows:
Mkv it please your Honor, and I trust It will
please you, gen tlemen of the jury. I would
do myself and my profession an injustice if I
did not at the outset return to you my grate
ful thanks for the pailent attentiou which
you have given to a case which, from my
point of view. I regard so important to every
citizen. Its nature and importance cannot be
overstated. It is not the personality of the
prosecuting witness or of the defendant which
gives it dignity and vital importance. The
prosecuting witness will ruu his course and
be forgotten. Even the Judge upon the bench,
in the fullness of time, will pass away,
and you ami I and all of us will he
down to sleep in the quiet grave. But
the principles which are nere at stakeâ the
principles of free government, of self-govern
ment, which are here attacked and which are
here feebly, but earnestly, by me defended,
are essential and will be enduring if jurors
are as brave and tearless and true to their
country as I believe you, each and all, to be.
It is not, I repeat, gentlemen, a question of
personalities. If it were so it would be a
small arid inconsequential ca<-e. It is the
mighty cause, the great principles, which are
nere at stake that gives our deliberations dig
nity and your decision great importance.
These princip eg are as alive to-day, 1 trust, as
they were when our ancestors fought and
bled and died lor them. The principles here
at stake and in peril are the same prin
ciples tor which English patriots laid
their heads upon the block and for
which Irish patriots mounted the seal
fold. In a word, gentlemen, the principles
at stake are these: In a free country, have
the people a rlghi to criticize their public ser
vants, or to comment upon or express their
sentiment* concerning those who seek public
office? It is notthe^case here of a private citi
zen; it is the case of your servant and mine,
because the Judge upon the bench Is the ser
vant of the peopleâ subject to their law,
amenable to their wishes and their decrees,
the same as the humblfst man that to-day
work* upon our streets. He is not above, but
below, and governeJ by the law, and you end
I and every man has the right, freely, to dis
cuss his menu or his demerits; lreelv to com
ment upon lus official conductâ freely to ap
prove it, freely to oppose it; freely, on the one
hand, to eulogize and praise him, or, on the
other, to oppose and denounce him. No man
shall deny us that right; and if you, or other
juries, or other courts, shall take that right
irom the citizen, sell-government is at an end
and liberty a dream not realized.
This subject carries us back to great strug
gles. Time was when to criticize men of high
place was to be flung into a dungeon, robbed
of property, stabbed in reputation and denied
the common privileges of citizenship. But in
this country, and we should be grateful for it.
the people ure the source of all power. Offi
cers are not put in their places by divine right
or by appointment from some higher power,
but are chosen by the people, and Bhould act
lor the people.
This, gentlemen, as we shall sec, is a prose
cution urged on against a citizen for express
ing his political sentiments in regard to a man
running lor an ouico. And I bay now, and
may have occasion to repeat it, that when 1
see a man in public office or seeking public
office that I regard as unfit and unfair, by vir
tue of passion or of ignorance, by virtue of
any of Ms surroundings, his conduce or his
life, I shall oppose him, I shall denounce him
with whatever vigor of language 1 have, and 1
would expect every citizen to exercise the
same privilege; then let tne people decide on
the merits of the controversy.
I had hoped, gentlemen, that when the cam
paign of 1 â¢â:**Â» was over, and after the heat, the
passions, Die excitements of the hour were
pnsseu, men would let the campaign end.
s-ome of you may have championed timt peer
less orator, William J. Bryan; some oi you
may have championed that masterful states
man, William McKiuley; come ot you may
have expressed yourselves with power and
vigor and earnestness in favor of one or
against the other, and feeling that the
one or the otner was the friend of his country,
you may have advocated him; or, feeling that
the other or his purposes or policy was aurtiul
anJ dangerous lo the country, you may have
denounced him as the enemy of his country.
But are you to bi brought into court for ex
pressing such political sentiments? Is jne
citizen to be pursued for expressing an opin
ion concerning a public question ? Is the citi
zen to have tue danger uf a criminal prosecu
tion over him if he dales to assert himself
during a campaign, whether it be by spoken
or by written words? That is the question
and that is the issue here.
After discussing the respective parties
to the case and pointing out that while
the Staif was the nominal prosecutor, in
reality Judge Hebbard occupied that of
fice, Mr. Shortridge continued:
Now, the State, through the influence of the
prosecuting witness, has caused an indict
ment to be filed against Mr. Marriott. '1 hat
Indictment, gentlemen, was filed by a body
of citizens holding secret session. That body
of citizens aid not know what you know.
Who appeared before that secret tribunal ?
One who dared not get upon that stand and
speak to you. Before that secret tribu al,
where tnere was no cross-examination, where
there was no opportunity of laying the facts,
and all the facts, before the jurors in that
secret tribunal, the prosecuting witness and
one Richard Dilion appeurea and testified.
Where was the prosecuting witness here when
the time came for him to speak ? Whereâ l
repeat itâ was Julius caesar Bonaparte Htb
bard ? Why did he not appear before you,
gentlemen, when the opportunity was offered?
Why did he go into tne silent chambers of a
Grand Jury, where many a reputation has
been stabbed, and then not dare to come
here, in the open, where all brave men fight?
It is only the coward who goes into the star
cnember; it is only the coward who fights in
the dark.
Gentlemen, he dared not take that witness
stand. Silence, in view of the testimony, is
confession, lie dared not deny, under oath,
the testimony of conduct winch was grossly
reprehensible. He daied not deny or contra
dict hip numerous witnesses the defendant
called to ihe stand ; he dared not deny that he
received those resolutions, passed by the de
positors. He dared not deny toat Mr. Bart
nett, in open court, begged him to desist from
contemplated action â the discharge of that
receiver and the exoneration of his
bondsmen. He dared not aeny â and I
would impress this upon youâ he dared
not deny that, in the darkness of night, when
Kood citizens are supposed either to be at
homeâ certainly not attending to court busi
ness here in this courthouse â he was con
veniently present to receive the gentlemen
who came in the hack from the hotel, then
and there to receive papers and make appoint
ments which were utterly void. His silence,
gentlemen, whV-n given an opportunity in
open court, protected by the court, is a con
fession that he could not, In honor and in
truth, deny that he has been consorting with
men, and doing things which reflected dis
credit and dishonor upon the bench.
Continuing, Mr. Shortrid^e declared no
proof bad been made by the other side
that Mr. Marriott was the actual owner of
the News Letter. An analysis of Mar
riott's editorial criticizing Hebbara fol
lowed in these words:
A man may be the "tool" of another and be
the soul 01 honor ami truth. He mny be the
"tool" of another tend be the greatest nnd best
citizen â the savior oi his country. And 1 am
indebted to a learned and eloquent gentle
man, whose voice has echoed so often in favor
of freedom and good governmentâ l am in
debted 10 one who sns in this courtroom now
ior this thought: Tnat a man may be the
tool of designing, ambitious politicians, when
his heart was purer, hla character spotless,
and his services the greatest tnat were ever
given to our beloved country.
a. few years ago. one whose name is upon
all lips, whose image is in every heart, whose
services have done more for this country tnan
all beside, was induced to go into a schemeâ a
political adventure â mid was urged to seek
the nomination for the tbird term for Presi
dent vi the United States ; designing, am
bitious men poured eulogy into the ears of
beloved Ulysses 8. Grant, and urged him to
â¢eek high place a third time, and those who
loved him most, those who spoke his name
with emotion, were justified in saying that he
was the tool of men who sought to work out
'heir own ambitious schemes.
After a discussion ot the presumptions
that must go with every citizen, that he
used language of criticism in an innocent
rather than an a harmful sense, the
speaker continued :
What are the facts as they have been de
veloped in this case? What is the truth so far
as we could learn? What attempt has been
made here to suppress truth, to conceal facts?
Who has attempted to conceal or to
suppress those facts? Did I not undertake
to reveal them? Did I not call for
every bit of evidence, and who was
it ihat kept the books, sealed the
locks upon them, and objected successfully, in
most instances, in keeping facts from your
Knowledge here? I called Judge Denson to
thestaud to tell of certain transactions at that
time. Who was it objected and kept the lips
of Judge Denson closed ? I called Mr.
John Flournoy, who, let me assure you, is
one of the most able and one ot the
purest gentlemen known in this State,
and who was it that kept his lips
closed and prevented him from telling
you gentlemen why he was dismissed and
discharged by that crowd in that bank at that
urne? I called many others, and all were
prevented from testifying by the same objec
tions. I produced the minute-bookâ do you
remember that, gentlemen?â and asked to read
the transactions of that July meeting,
and who was it that raised their
objections and prevented the reading
oi that record oi those transactions ? I called
for every book and paper which would ihrow
light upon this matter, and in every instance
the State here objected, and for reasons which
seemed sufficient for the court we were denied
the crivilege of read ing these important facts.
And throughout the whole thing there was
the cowardly pretense that the Judge of that
department was ignorant of what he did.
Why, the most ragged tramp that walks
the dusty roads in the Bin Joaquin is
presumed to know the law. And a Judge upon
the bench is not held to be presumed to know
the facts about which he enters important or
ders, makes important decrees, discharges men
from their stewardship, exonerates bondsmen
â politicians! He is not presumed to know
anything he does, but is set upon the bench
like an automaton, working by a string pulled
by somebody else, and when his official con
duct is brought into question throw
aroundjhim the cowardly barrier of ignorance
âdidn't know what his receiver was doing;
didn't know what his attorney was doing;
didn't know how they were trampling upou
the heads of widows and orphans by throwing
out of the bank building men who' had toiled
for their money.
Mr. Shortridge then discussed at length
the evidence upon which the defendant
based His claim that the charges of the
editorial were trueâ the appointments of
the receiver, the July meeting at which
Sheehan and Watt voted themselves into
oiftce, their approval of their own
acts by the board of directors elected by
themselves, the broken promises of Judge
Hetbard. In speating oi the men whom
the committee had selected as directors of
the bank if the Judge Dad allowed the re
organization of the directorate, the
speafeer paid the following tribute to one
of the gentlemen suggested :
The seventh man was one who had been
abused more, perhaps, than any other man in
this City and upon whom I look as one of
the truest Christian gentlemen that ever en
gaged in charily or Christian work. I refer to
the seventh director in the person of
Charles Montgomery. If there bs a Chris
tian in this town, if there be a man
who will go down in the gutter
to lift up the fallen and put hope into
the heart of the despairing, if there be a man
who will go among thieves and robbers into
the brothel and strive to rescue one girl or one
boy from death, morally and otherwise, it is
that same Charles Montgomery, who was
hounded and abused because he went there in
the latter days of that sinking bank, because
his fric-mis had asked him to do so, and sought
to aid them as a Christian man. And, there
fore, all parties were agreed that Charles
Montgomery snould remain on that board.
With a brief review ot the salient points
of his argument the speaMr closed, afier
appealing to the jury as honest and patri
otic citizens to deal out not mercy but
justice to the defendant and to acquit
him.
A recess was then taken by court
and jury to prepare for tiie onslaught of
Julius Kahn, who concluded with an ar
gument of one hour's duration in behalf
of Judge Hebbard.
Kahn set things in motion by quoting
from Shakespeare that he ''was no orator"'
as Mr. Shortridge, but he was "here to
defend my friend, Judge Hebbard, whom I
know to ba honest and upright." The
theory of criminal actions for libel whs
then commented on. It was that a man
might not tase the law into his own hands.
The Hebbard version of the bank liti
gation followed, illustrated with frequent
eulogies of the "honest and upright
Judge." It was because that the various
factions of the depositors failed to agree,
so Kahn said, that Judge Hebbard ret used
to modify his famous blanket resolution.
An invocation to free speech and free
expression of opinion followed. Kahn
closed with a political peroration, in
which be pictured Hebbard "standing
amid the wreck of a world" ; but just
what this had to do with the case the
attorney did not vouchsafe an explana
tion.
Judge Daingerfield's instructions to the
jury consumed almost an hour. He re
viewed the law of libel in detail. Con
cerning the litigation affeotinsr the affairs
of the savings bank Judge Daingerfield
told the jury that Sneenan's appointment
as receiver was an illegal one, but that
Judge Hebbard might have honestly be
lieved that he was interpreting the law
correctly when be made the order.
A receiver was responsible to the court
for his action, but when he held his office
under an illegal order it was a debatable
question if he should report to the court
or to others, in this instance to the board
of directors. The depositors were the
equitable owners of a bank. Technical
differences between criticism and slander
were then referred to. The line of separa
tion was rather indefinite and a matter for
the jury. At 4:30 o'clock the jury retired,
and after deliberating returned a yerdict
of not guilty.

How Grant Broke a Runaway Horse.
Colonel Peyton, whose death was cbron-
icled yesterday, wrote s book, "Reminis
cences of the Past." In this he refers to
his first meeting with Grant as follows:
"In the year 1838 I was working as a
boy in a country store at Flat
Rock, Bourbon County, Ky. Ulysses
S. Grant was then a boy, living at George
town, Ohio, not many miles distant. One
day Grant drove over to Flat Rock with
the niece of my employer. Grant was
then 16 years of age, awkward, ungainly,
determined, industrious, and very poorly
dressed. He drove a vicious horÂ«e. The
night after his arrival at Flat Rock he
slept with me in the store. It was ac old
night, and we boys kept close to the
lee of the counter. In the morning Grant
asked me if he could be of assistance
to me. I answered yes. He helped me
take down the shutters and sweep out the
store and put stock in place. After break*
fast he drove off. 1 heard from him after
ward of his drive home. Before he had
gone far from Flat Rock his horse ran
away and dually brought up with a crash
in a fence corner. Nothing broke. Grant
jnmped our, seized the trembling horse by
the bridle and tied bit handkerchief over
the beast's eyes. He drove the horse
blindfolded all the way to Georgetown,
Ohio." â Philadelphia Ledger.
