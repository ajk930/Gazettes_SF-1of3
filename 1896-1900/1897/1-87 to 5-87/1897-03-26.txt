MALAXA LAID
WASTE BY THE
INSURGENTS
Qetan Christians Rout the
Turkish Troops at the
Garrison.
PROTECTING FIRE OF WARSHIPS
PREVENTS ANNIHILATION.
Again the Combined Fleets of the European
Powers Bombard the Brave Men Who
Are Fighting to Throw Off the
Yoke of Turkey.
CANEA, Crete, March 25.â artil
lery of the insurgents surround in the
town of Maiaxa having rendered that
place untenable to the Turkish troops
comprising the Maiaxa garrison, the lat
ter begun a retreat to Suda Bay last even
ing. They were pursued by the insur
* gents, who kept up a heavy fire upon the
â¢ Turks, inflicting a heavy loss anon them
in killed and wounded until the Turkish
warships opened fire upon the insurgents,
causing them to retire to the interior. But
for the timely assistance of the warships
tne Turks would have been well nigh an
nihilated.
The attempt to revictuai the garrison at
Jlalaxa which was made last night was as
disastrous to the Turks as was the effort
they made yesterday. The detachment of
â¢ troops carrying a supply of provisions
was met by a "strong force of insurgents
and compelled to retreat with considerable
lot?.
The fighting in the vicinity of Maiaxa
continued throughout the day.. It^as
especially desperate at 3 o'clock this *<tei> |
i?rr fa ihÂ«- village of Tsicolaria," where
the insurgents set tire to a number of Turk
ish houses.". .* - ...
The insurgents are now occupying
Maiaxa. The European - warship .bom
barded them this afternoon. The insur
gents, however, held their ground close to
the ruins of l he blockhouse, from which
they drove the Turkish garrison last
night, and "did not seem to greatly mind
the bombardment.
* When the Turkish troops eradiated the
blockhouse they. set fi:e to it in order that
it mikht not furnish a shelter to their
enemies. â  It -' was, - however, , badly
â¢ p wrecked by the fire of the rebels.
" . It is evident that tne Turkish troops
her* are no match for the insurgents. A
* body of troops made an attempt to-day to
gain the heights above 2s'erok-Ouru,
where the Keratidi blockhouse is situated.
' With this position and the one at Malaxa
in their possession the insurgents would
be able to ' completely blockade Canea
from the land side.
. . The troops had gone only a little dis
. tance when they were attacked by in
surgents, ' who drove them back. Later
another attempt was made to reach the
heights, but this, too, proved unsuccessful.
' t A, body of insurgents made an attack
* upon the Turkish cordon at Halepa. The
Turks had a numberof mounted guns and
the * tire from them prevented the in
surgents from coming to close quarters. j
ADMIRAL NAPOLEON CANEVARO,
Whom Minority of grade has placed in chief command of the mixed fleet of
war Teasels of the powers in Cretan waters, is An American by birth, having
been born in Lima, Peru, July 7, 1838. After having passed throutn ah the
lower grades in the Italian uavy he was appointed vice-admiral in June, 1893,
and is now one of the most distinguished officers in the service. He com
manded the Christoforo Colombo in the voyage of circumnavigation of the
world made by that vessel in 1877. Hi* experience in war was gamed in the
campaigns of 1859, 1860-61 and in 1868, in each of which he earned and re
ceived promotion. Since 1894 he has b'en a member of the Superior Council
of Naval Affairs, and commandant-in-cnief of three maritime departments.
The San Francisco Call
It was this alone which aaved the Mos
lems from defeat.
Montevardia and Halepa are both within
range of the guns of the insurgents, who
continue to shell both places.
This evening part of Maiaxa was blown
up with dynamite and the rest of the
town is burning. The Turkish warships
iv Suda Bay are bombarding the in
surgents, bnt their lire appears to be
wholly ineffective.
Maiaxa is one of the towns mentioned
by the foreign admirals in tneir procla
mation iusued on Tuesday that must not
be attacked by Greek troops or insurgents.
The admirals declared that the fornica
tions which were needed to -maintain se
curity and quiet" must not be fired upon,
otherwise they would use foice against the
I attackers. It wa* the disobedience of the
insurgents to this proclamation that led
the foreign warships to bombard them.
These vessels tired ninety suells, three of
wijich fell within the 'orts.
After toe place had been evacuated by
its Turkish garrison, which uumoereit
sixty-four men, the troops scattered in
any direction that led to the coast in order
to escape from their pursuers. One of
them reached Norck-Ouru and eighteen
managed 10 mate their way to Suda Bay.
The others have not been heard from, and
it is supposed that they were killed.
The Mussulmans here, and they com
prise almost the entire population, are in
a state of great excitement. They fear
that the insurgents, ela'.ed by their cap
ture and destruction of Maiaxa, will at
tack Keraidi.
A force of 500 Highlanders was landed
at Candia to-day, and its appearance in
the city caused the moat intense excite
i ment. The populace evidently were
ignorant of the Highlanders coming un
til they were in town. The Turkish
troops were at a loss to account for their
appearance and apparently thought that
they were about to be attacked. The
Turkish officers had much difficulty in
preventing their men from firing on the
British troops.
The garrison troops ruined to the shore
from all directions, leaving their rifles as
they ran and uttering threats against the
British. The latter remained perfectly
cool and eventually the irritation was
calmed. Ail danger, however, is not over.
The Turkish troops uo not appear to
grasp the fact that the presence of the
foreigners is practically the only thine
thai, saves them from annihilation.
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, MARCH 26, 1897.
Swarms of Turkish soldiers, armed to the
teeth, are parading about the streets,
giving voice to their tierce hatred of all
infidels. The slightest spark may at any
moment proauce a fatal outbreak. It
wouia be a queer commentary on the
Turkish gratitude to tind the Moslems
and their Christian allits engaged in a
bloody religious feud, and it would further
complicate the situation.
A number of Italian troops have also
arrived at Candia. The foreign admirals
to-day issued a general order to the inter
national re-enforcements exhorting them
to set an example to the Cretans, whom
the powers have charged them to protect
from the horrors of a civil war. The or
der concludes: |
"The enterprise we are embarked upon
will be difficult ana often painful. We
rely upon you to defend the interests of
humanity and the honor of our flag. 1 '
ATHENS, Greece, March 25. â The
Crown Prince will start at 4 o'clock to
morrow morning for The^saly, where he
will take command of the Greek troops.
The early hour at which he will leave the
city is due to a desire to avoid a demon
stration.
Advices received, here show that the
Turks, in accordance with instructions
from Constantinople, bave began to dis
mount guns placed by them upon the
formication?, at Previse* on the Turkish
sine of the Gulf of Arta. These fortifica
tions were constructed in direct violation
of the provisions of the treaty of Berlin,
and the commander of the Greek fleet a
few days ago notified the Turkish com
mander that if the guns were not dis
mounted be would bombard the works.
LONDON, Eng., March 25 âThe Athens
correspondent of the .Chronicle declares
that the departure of Crown Friueo Con
stantine for Thessaly is of the most seri
ous import. It can only mean that
Greece believes that war ia probable and
declines to further handicap herself by
delaying the final step of preparation.
The Prince's arrival on the frontier will
me.'in a new disposal of the forces and will
cive a new impetus to all the arrange
ments for transportation of troops, etc.

' first Encoun'tr .of- lonelada After thÂ«
American (irtl War*
~ The battle of Lissa is memorable as be
ing the first tight with ironclad war vessels
after the close of the American Civil War.
It was fought on July 20, 1866, in the
Adriatic Sea, off the island of Lush, and
between Austrian and Italian warships.
v Italy since 1860 had devoted great atten
tion to naval matters and had spent since
that time Â£12,000.000 :on ; her t fleet. Her
two finest ships, the Re d'ltalia and the
Re di Portogallo, cost ! Â£325,000 each and
had been built at Webb's yard, New York.
They were of 5700 tons (old measurement)
with seven inches of armor, the first car
rying two 150-oounders with thirty 6-inch
guns and four smooth bores, the second two
300- pounders with twenty-six 6-inch guns.
But they bad been built with green wood I
and were weak in the ; ribs. â They lacked
buoyancy and maneuvering power and (
their rudders were exposed, a fault whicn
led. to grave results at Lissa. - 'â¢- - , ;
. Next; to them , was the â  Affondatore, a
turret-ram of 4070 tons, built at Mil Wall
on the Thames. >.> She Â«" carried [\ five-inch
armor ?â¢ and --, two 'i 300-pounder" Armstrong
guns, placed '! in ; two ? turrets. V; Her enor
mous ram projecting twenty-six feet and
her powerful armament led the Italians to
consider her as their best ship, while Per
sano in: particular put almost childish
faith in her. Yet she, too, was a bad sea
boat, plunging very heavily, owing to the
itreat weight of J turret aud belt forward,
and her steering was clumsy and at times
irresponsible. "' " 'â :'['' â  .'â  â  .â -'â¢;Â«-:.â  .; â â '*â â 'â â ')
The two small rama Terrible and For
midable, of 2700 tons, had been built in
France. Tney carried 4%- inch piatine
and ti-incn rifles as their primary arma
ment. The Maria Pia, Castelhdardo. An
cona, San Martino and Principe Carie
nano were broadside ironclads of over 4000
torn with an end to end armor on the
water-line.
Two armored gun boats, the Paleatro and
the Varese, each carried two Amatrong
150-pounders with some smaller Runs.
Besides these were numerous frigates and
steam corvettes. There were nine of these
at Lissa carrying from fifty to twenty-four
guns.
Tbts tine fleet was placed tinder com
mand of Admiral Count Carlo Pellion di
Persano, who had spent his life in the
Sardinian navy, lie proved to be vacillat
ing and iacKing in dash and bravery, and
bis conduct before and during the battle
exhibited incapacity and cowardice.
Hu disinclination to attack tue Austrian
fleet which was waiting for him stirred
Minister Depretii to send him a stinging
dispatch. "Would you tell the people,"
he wrote, "the people who in their mad
vanity believe their sailors the best in the
world â that in spite of the twelve millions
we have added to their debt the squadron
that we have collected is one incapable of
facing the enemy? We should be stoned.
And who has ever beard the Austrian fleet
mentioned except with contempt?"
On the 7th of July the wobbly admiral
was driven out to soa by an imperative or
der, but he did not find the Austrian fleet.
The King ordered him to capture the
island of Lissa, thirty miles from the Dal
matian mainland. Tbe admiral put to sea
on the 16th with 500 marines and 1000
soldiers. He had begged for a landing
force of 5000 men.
Disaster and defeat followed in the wake
of cowardice. Albini attacked Porto
Manego with hi.-? wooden ships. 'When
three shells pierced hid flagship, killing
two men and wounding three, he dis
obeyed orders and retreated. Fifty of the
Formidable's crew were killed and
wounded, her funnel and upper works out
side her armor were riddled, her rigging
and bulwarks cut to bits.
The order of the Austrian commander
Tegetthoff was "Ram everything gray,"
and h\ niada a valorous assault on the
Italians at close quarters. The Red' ltalia
was rammed and sunk by the Ferdinand
Max; the Pales tro was blown up.
ItM Austrians won the battle after hay
ing inflicted serious loss upon their Italian
opponents. ______^_____^^
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE.
Broad- Gauge Address by Canada's Gov
ernor-General on the Opening
of Parliament
OTTAWA, Ont., March 26. âThe Do
minion Parliament was opened at 3
o'clock this afternoon by his Excellency,
the Governor-General, with a speech from
the throne.
His Excellency expressed his gratifica
tion at the evidences throughout the
Dominion of loyalty and affection for the
Queen and the empire in celebrating tlie
diamond jubilee, and announced that
arrangements are being made for an ef
fective representation of the Dominion in
connection with the commemoration of
the historic occasion in London. His
Excellency also hoped that the settlement
of the Manitoba school question will put
an end to the agitation which has marred
the harmony and impeded the develop
ment of the country and will prove the
beginning of a new era, to be character
ised by generous treatment of one another,
mutual concessions and reciprocal good
will.
Continuing, his Excellency said: "A
measure will be submitted to you for a
revision of the tariff, which it is believed
will provide the necessary revenue and,
while having due regard for the industrial
interests, will make our fiscal system more
satisfactory to the masses of the people.
"The Government hat determined that
advantages to accrue both to our Western
producers and the business interests of
the whole dominion from the completion
i of tne works for the enlargement of the
St. Lawrence canals, should no longer be
deferred, and has, subject to the approval
of Parliament, taken the initial steps for a
vigorous prosecution of those works and
for the perfecting of the canal system by
the close of the year 1898.
"The .tiering Sea Claims Convention, to
adjust the damages payable to the own
ers of the British sealing vessels seized by
the cruisers of the United States on the
bigh seas, ha 3 completed taking the evi
dence submitted to it by the respective
Governments of her Majesty and the
United States, and has adjourned fora
time to hear the arguments thereon in be
halt of the governments. 1 indulge the
nope that a final and satisfactory adjudi
cation of those long delayed claims will
now speedily oe reached."
His Excellency then referred to the
calamity in India, and the generous re- ,
spouse of Canadians to the appeal for aid,
and concluded with a notice of the esti
mates for the coming year.

Which He R lutes the S'ate
mots of the Minority.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 25 â This
was the last day of general debate on the
tnriff bill in the House under the onier
adopted last week, but because Bailey's
throat wou'd not permit him to speak
this afternoon, an agreement was made to
give two hours to general debate just be
fore the vote next Wednesday, which will
be occupied by Bailey and Dingley. The
proceedings ware listened to generally by
a large number of members and crowded
galleries'. Speeches against tiie bill were
made by Talbot (D.) of South Carolina,
Clark (D.) of Missouri, Magaire (D.)of
California, Gunn (Pop. ) of Idaho, Simp
son (Pod.) of Kansas. Cox (D.) of Tennes
see, McÃae (D.) of Arkansas, Burke (D.)
of Texas, Lsntz (D.) of Ohio, and DeAr
ruond (D.) of Missouri, and in its favor by
Tawney (R.)of Minnesota, Dalzell (R.)
Pennsylvania, Russell (R.) of Connecti
cut, and Payne (R.) of North Carolina,
members of the Ways and Means Com
mittee, and Grow (R.) of Pennsylvania,
Curtis (R.) of Kansas, Colson (R.) of Ken
tucky and Hawiey (R.) of Texas.
At 5 o'clcck the House took a recess
' until 8 o'citck to-night, the niebt session
to witness the aat of the general debate
except the two hour* on Wednesday next,
just prior to talcing the vole on the bill.
The fourth and last day of the general
debate on the tariff bill brought forth a
request nt the opening of the session by
Bailey (D.) of IVxas, for an exiension of
two hours of the debate. He stated that
be bad been under treatment for sore
throat, and it would be impossible for him
to occupy the floor for an hour to-day.
Payne (R.) of Nsw York objected to the
request.
Talbot (D. ) of South Carolina opened
the discussion in a fifteen minutes' speech
against the bill.
Champ Clark of Missouri made one of
his characteristic sp-ecties against the
bill. As an American citizen and in sym
pathy with itie people whom he repre
sented he was dead against the bill. As a
] Democratic politician he would rejoice in
its pa-sap e, for it would compel every
merchant every time he made a sale
across his counter to make a Democratic
speech to the purchaser. Unless the Sen
ate radically amended the bill the Demo
crats would have 100 majority in the
House in the next Congress and in 1900
would elect their President, the people
thus again coming into their own. Clark
said that ordinarily he was a peaceable
man, but charges had been made on toe
other side in the course of this debate that
made him regret the law against man2
slaughter could not be temporarily sus
pended. [Laughter.]
"When an able man like Hopkins of
Illinois, and a brilliant man like Dolliver
of lowa," he said, "assert that the Wilson
bill is a free-trade measure it is an outrage
on common-sense, truth and decency. I
do not concede to any protectionist the
rleht to define what Iree trade means."
Clark referred to the changes made in
the Wilson bill by the Senate and ex
claimed that the debate on the tariff
would go on forever until the people and
Congress came to the platform and the
policy of common-sense and Iree trade.
He ridiculed the duties laid on agricultu
ral products, asserting that it was impos
sible to give to toe farmer any protection
on his products. He made great fuu of
the duty of 2 cents a gallon on mile. "I'd
like to see a gallon of Canadian milk," he
said, "by the time it got down into Jerry
Simpson's district in Kansas. It would
set the bogs' teeth on edge if offered to
them for swill." [Laughter.]
The free list afforded him a large field
for the exercise of his sarcasm. Clark
said the situation could be greatly re
lieved if the Republican leaders would
turn their attention to reducing expendi
tures instead of adding to the burdens of
the people.
"Cut the army in two," he advised.
"Nobody in the country seems to have
any use for the army nxcept George M.
Pullman and the Pullman Palace (Jar
Company. Abolish the diplomatic corps.
It has never been used. It was always or
namental. I can pick out a newspaper
correspondent in the gallery there, send
him to Europe, and I will warrant he will
send out more in a week about the condi
tion of affairs there than the whole diplo
matic corps between now and next Christ
mas. | Laughter.] And, finally, repeal
the civii service law and save every dol
lar the commission costs. [Applause.]
Maguire (D.) of California and Gunn
(Pop.) of Idaho opposed the bill, the for
mer asserting that it was fallacious to as
sume that a protective tariff would pro
duce a period of prosperity and the latter
asserting that the committee in preparing :
the paragraph relating to lead had failed
to properly consider the interests -of the
American producer.
Tawney (R.)of Minnesota, a member of
the Committee on Ways and Means, re
plied to the criticism of Gunn defending
the action of the committee. The duty
laid on lead in silver ore, he said, was 1
cent a pound, estimated by the treasury
experts at 100 per cent, and yet the gentle
man from Idaho complained that the
American producer was not properly cared
for.
Gunnâ The duty you mention is ample
and all the people of Idaho ask. What
.they want is that you should collect it.
. Tawney further elucidated the details of
the duty on ltad and devoted himself to a
review of the attitude of the two great
parties toward the tariff question, con
trasting the declarations of tne National
conventions on the subject. In the face of
his remarks Tawney spoke of the state
ments made in the campaign of 1896 by
the Democratic speakers. A constituent
of one of them, Tawney said, sued him to
recover the difference between the prom
ised prices of wheat and what he actually
received.
Ciark(D.)of Missouriâ And has not the
man sued the head and front of the gold
Republican Aid Society of last year?
Tawueyâ lt is true that Bynura stood
for sound money and the National credit
in 1896; bu: it is also true that he made
the promises spoken of. And I think the
gentleman from Missouri, if be did noi
make them, came very near to it.
To :his Clark made no response.
Jerry Bimpson (P.) of Kansas made his
first speech since his reappearance into the
House at this juncture. He read from Mr.
McKinley's speech to the Minneapolis
convention, in which he said it was the
policy of the Republican party to tax for
eigners rather than the people of our own
tountry to raise money to meet the ex
penditures of the Government.
'â¢We have been bothered a good deal out
in Kane is." Simpson continued, "to know
why Congress should be bothered about
ih's matter of increasing the revenues
when it is so easy to reduce the expendi- I
tures. But this speech of the present I
President explains the whole thing. The I
loreigner pays the taxes, and the idea of
the chief executive is to pass this bill and
make the foreigners pay the taxes that it
imposes. It seems to me, in view of this
fact, that the foreigner ought to be thank
ful that we did not realize a two billion
Congress instead of a single billion dollar
Congress." [Laughter and applause.]
Referring to the speech of Waiter (R.)
of Massachusetts, Simpson said that he
bad carried his argument to its logical I
conclusion and had deolared that the pur- |
pose of taxation was to distribute wealth I
among the people. Putting theory with I
that of the President that the foreigner
pays the tariff taxes, Simpson claims we
have reached the ideal condition wherÂ«
b'.l we have to do is to pass tariff bills and
taxing measures and Uy back and work
no more.
Cox (D.) of Tennessee and McÃae (D.)
of Arkansas followed in opposition to the
bill and Grow (R.) of Pennsylvania in
favor of its passage.
Curtis (R.) of Kansas favored the bill.
Burke (D.) of Texas made a five-minute
speech against the bill. He was followed
by Lentz (D.) of Ohio, who entered a pro
test against the passage of the bill and the
method of its consideration. The six
Democratic Representatives from Ohio on
the floor, he said, wno stood for the prin
ciples of the Democratic partj as exem
t lifted in the Chicago platform, and with
â¢William Bryan as their standard-bearer,
lied twenty minutes given them in which
to oppose the passage of a bill framed
under an Insidious title, intended to de
ceive, and having; for its object the en-
Ticning of trusts and the pauperization of
â¢the people. The only letter ne had re
ceived from his district in favoi of the bill
was from a whisky-seller, and in that fact
ho saw that the whisky trust hed joined
the sugar trust and the coal trnst in writ
i'uÃ the provisions of tbe bill.
The speech of Dalzell (R.) of Pennsyl
vania, a member of tne Ways and Means
Committee, evoked repeated bursts of ap
plause from his colleagues on the floor.
He devoted a considerable part of his
remarks to the existing treasury condi
tions.
Referring to the declaration in the re
port of the minority members of the ccm
nuttee that this bill would raise too much
I revenue, Dalzell maintained that in no I
! event would it ba more than was neces- j
sary to pay the interest and principal on i
the bonds that the Democrats had floated
to sustain the National credit. He de
fended the law of 1890 from the criticisms
I passed upon it by showing how American
j industries had thrived under its provi
sions and how the tin,-piate industryâ an
industry unknown in this country â had
| been enormously stimulated by that law.
j He denied that this bill would foster trusts,
j and said that sucn assertions were based
; upon ignorance of existing economic con
| ditions. He referred to the laws in the
I several States under which combinations
]of capital were permitted, and did i
I not deny that the system was abused. He
: did deny that a protective tariff bill j
' fostered trusts and showed tliat such com
j binations existed in free-trade England
| equally with protective America. He
j described the conditions of living in Shef
field and Pittsburgâ two cities wnich were
i rivals in many branches of industry. In
! Sheffield was presented the picture of
I starved life, penury, low wages and lack
i of culture; in Pittsburg high wages, freeÂ«|
| schools, intelligence and manhood. If j
these conditions were to be changed it |
must be by bringing Sheffield up to the â 
levei of Pittsburg, and not by bringing >
I P.ttsburg down to the level of Sheffield.
Colton (R.) of Kentucky, while approv- j
| in -â¢ the general features of the bill, gave
I notice that he would move an amendment
! fixing a duty on cannel coal at $1 a ton, as
I the domestic mines would otherwise be j
1 unable to compete with cannel coal mines j
j in Scotland.
Russtll (R.) of Conneticut, a member of I
j the Ways and Means Committee, called
attention to a remarkable calculation just
j now put forth in the New England press j
i by Edward Atkinson of Boston regarding
I the wool and woolen schedule of the bill. \
! New England knew Atkinson, he said, as
a distinguished representative of free- trade
sentiment and as a mattiematicai caicu
! lator with a pessimistic tendency.
He had gone beyond the school of
political economy represented by John
i Randolph of Roanoke, who looked upon
j sheep as a mere incident to the hillside,
j whose right to protection against dog or
man was not to be considered for a
moment and who derived great satisfac
tion from going many miles merely to
Kick a sheep. [Laughter.J
In the opinion of Steele (R.) of Indiana,
also a member of the committee, the bill
was the most complete and symmetrical
tariff measure tuat was ever framed. He
approved of its protective features for the
reason that he believed every nation
should produce for itself everything that
could be manufactured or grown within
its borders.
Hawley, the Republican member of the
Texas delegation, attacked the attitude of
Representatives from the South toward the
bill. He charged them with injuring the
I interest of their own section by objecting
to a protective tariff bill.
DeArmond (D.) of Missouri chargpd
that the corporations, trusts and great ag
gregations of capital had arrayed them
selves on the side of the Republican party
and it was therefore natural that in the
preparation of the schedules of the bill
their desires should have been consulted.
Tuis bill meant higher prices for the neces
saries of life, which the people must buy.
What benefit could this bill possibly be to
those already perplexed trying to make
both ends meet? Whatever the changes
sought to be ameliorated might be the
measure under consideration could not
possibly afford the desired relief.
Tne remedy was not increased taxation,
but greater economy in administration.
Mr. Payne paid some attention to the
attacks that had been made at the
agricultural schedules and declared that
this biil protected every agricultural pro
duction for the reason that the committee
believed the United States could and
should raise all this for it3elf. He gave in
detail the items upon which the commit
tee increased the duty, and explained the
reason why they were selected. The sugar
schedule, Payne saiJ, was made up with
the idea of producing revenue and of en
couraging the industry here. It would
have done no good, he said, to put refined
sugar on the free list, for that would simply
have driven the refiner* to the sugar pro
ducing countries and there would have
been no revenue to the Government and
no employment for the thousands at work
in the refineries.
In conclusion Payne said that in the
course of a few years $50,000,000 of reve
nue would be dropped from the sugar
schedule and other millions now paid for
the purchase of tin plate, linen and
woollen goods, which will then be manu
factured here. "We do not believe that
taxing the people will make them rich,
but it is necessary to tax them to raise
revenue for the Government, and we be
lieve in providing them with work whereby
they can earn the money to pay the
taxes." [Great applause.]
At 5 o'clock the committee rose and the
House took a recess until 8 o'clock.
At the evening session, Prince (R.) of
Illinois spotce in support of the bill. He
said the measure presented the views of
the Republican leaders and would protect
our great industries and provide sufficient
revenue to meet the expenses of the Gov
ernment.
Settle (D.) of Kentucky opposed the bill
because it was the most ultra-protective
measure presented. It cared for the
wealthy and neglected the farmer and
laborer.
Barthold (R.) of Missouri approved the
biil because it would give the necessary
revenue and afford protection to Ameri
can labor. He referred to Bailey's oppo
sition and characterized the views of this
"new-born leader" as "Siamese twiaism
and popocracy vice."
Campbell (D.) of Illinois said that the
present bill was simpiy an exaggeration of
the McKinley law and would be repu
diated by the people.
Skinner (Pop.) of North Carolina, in
fcupporting the bill, said that if for the
past twenty-five years tne South had been
trying for protection as the North and
East had it would to-day be the most
prosperous section of the country. The
bill had its defects, and he did not think
it would bring prosperity without supple
mental financial legislation. Revenue, in
his opinion, sufficient to supply de
ficiencies, could be sustained by reducing
by one-third tha salaries of all Govern
ment employes or Dy a proportionate in
come tax.
I Myers (D.) of Louisiana said that some

of the duties inferred by tbo bill might be
erroneous and excessive, but as a repre
sentative of Louisiana, representing a
great and suffering interest, he should
support the sugar schedule.
Reeves (R.) of Illinois advocated the
passage of the bill, as did Howe (R.) of
; New York.
Gaines(D.) of Tennessee, in opposition
to the bill, presented in reply to Grosvenor
of Ohio a certified copy of the letter of
Secretary Foster of February, 1893, order
ing the preparation of plates for bonds.
Barrow's (R.) of Massachusetts presented
the protest of the Massachusetts Library
Club against any tax on boots.
Ridgely (Pop.) of Kansas opposed the
bill and advocated economic measures
and a reduction of the expenses of the
Government.
Hamilton (R.) of Michigan supported
the bill as a patriotic and American prop
osition.
Tcdd (D.) of Michigan followed in oppo
sition to the measure.
Crum packer (R.) of Indiana approved
the measure because he believed that
under it busings would revive aud labor
find employment.
Fitzgerald (D.) of Massachusetts con
cluded his remarks begun to-day in oppo
sition to the bill, and the House at 11
o'clock adjourned.

Chicago Judge Decide* That Jionrd of
Trade Can't Withhold Market >>Â«â Â».
CHICAGO, 1n,., March 25.â 1n the in
junction suit instigated .by the Board of
Trade to restrain the telegraph companies
from furnishing outsider*, and especially
bucket-shops, with market quotations,
Judge Horton decided against the board
this morning. He declares that the Quo
tations are public property and cannot be
withheld by the board. ' .
The court overruled a motion to dis
solve the â  temporary : injunction restrain
ing ! the Board of Tiade, the Western
Union Telegraph Company, the Postal
Telegraph-Cable Company and the Gold
and Stock Telegraph Company from de
taching telegraph vires ."; from ' alleged
bucket-shops, from removing "tickers" or
from interfering in any way with their
supply of market information.
"Market news," the court said, "being a
species of property of public consequence,
the Board of Trade shall not be permitted
to deprive the public of such information.
The Supreme Court has said that so long
as the board is in existence it must not
discriminate in the distribution of its quo*
tations and shall be caused to furnish in
formation to all persons at - the same
terms.:' c-:\ -.;â¢â > ; â  ' â  - â¢. ;.; â 
"The Board of Trade has become a sort
of public agent, controlling to a considera
ble extent public interests and the inter
ests of individual members of that public
who may be engaged in business affected
by the market news established by the
Board of Trade. , ;
"Telegraph companies are agents for the
public. The court does not want it un
derstood that any individual has a right
to go upon the floor of the exchange and
gather news, but approves of the rules and
[ regulations permitting telegraph com-
I panics to distribute the news." .'. -:â :<â ':
Concluding, the court says: "These
market quotations have become clothed
with a public interest in behalf of such
producers, consumers, shippers, mer
chants and dealers only as are engaged in
legitimate business and such as use or fur
nish the same for use in the legitimate
business transactions of the country. The
law never stamps private property with a
public interest for the benefit of the law
breakers." ' - â¢

BREAKS AND CUTS
IN THE LEVEES
An Engineer Causes the
Water to Invade the
Country.

Farmers.
Frcm Points in Missouri and" Arkan
sas Come Stories of Great
Devastation-
MEMPHIS, Tfnn.. March 25.-The
Mississippi showed another fractional fall
to-day, so slignt as to require no rjarticu
lar attention. Two small breaks in the
levee occurred near the Missouri line.
The most important development to
day is the story from Helena that the
low^r White River levee from Modoc
south had been cut under instructions
from the Desha Levee Board-, in charge of
the levee, and that the cutting was done
by J. H. Wellington, the engineer of the
board, in half a dozen places. The water
through these cuts devastated the fertile
country between Hugi eys and La Conia
Circle, drowning cattle and other live
stock and driving the surprised and de
fenseless inhabitants to the levee for pro
tection. The supposition is that the cut
ting was done in order to relieve the levee
protecting La Conia Circle, but it will
hardly avail in the judgement of those
ianiiliar wth the situation.
CHARLESTON, Mo., March 25.-Sev
eral more breaks in the levee occurred
since last night, and a current of water
strong as a mill-race was rushing through
the center of Bird's Point. Already a
dozen houses are swept from their founda
tions, and it looked as if there would not
be & building left.
HELENA, Aek., March 25.â Another
break in the levee was reported this morn
ing. It was 500 feet in width and hourly
increasing. It is thought that all the
White River levee system from Modoc
soutli will eventually go to pieces.
HIGHEST FLOOD.
The Worst Ever Known on the Mis
sissippi Rlver-On 9 Great Sea
From New Madrid, Mo.,
to Helena, Ark.
The flood has already reached the high
est stage ever known, and every in
dication points to further rise and long
continuance. From New Madrid, Mo., to
Helena, Ark., the wbole country is under
water from five to twenty-five feet as far
west as Crowlevs Ridge, except two ridges
between the Missississipi and the St.
Irancis rivera and tiie towns when are
protected by levees unusually high and
strong. The suffering and loss of prop
erty cannot be even estimated at this
time, but it is sate to say that it will far
exceed anything ever known before.
From its peculiar situation Memphis af
fords better opportunities for observing
and pausing tne flood in this section ttian
any other poim on the river. Situated as
it is on the last of the Chicasaw Bluffs,
with an unbroken stretch of forty miles of
low country between it and Crowleys
Ridge, the nearest high groun-1 on tue
Arkansas side of the river, below the
mouths of the great upper tributaries and
above the lower ones, the readings of its
gauge eive the fairest averages of any.
The Government gauge snows the high
est water since its estabii>hment in 1872 â
37 feet above low water-mark â the next
highest being the great flood of 1890,
which reached 35.7 feet, the highest since
the sinking of the lowlands about 2Sew
Madrid in 1811.
Along the Mississippi, as well as its
principal tributaries, the alluvial iancls
slot c back: from the main stream to tne
natural ridges, which in some cases as
near the mouth of the Arkansas River, are
as much as eighty miles away, and when
the levees, which confine the or. inary
hich water to the regular channel, break,
the waters cour over the adjacent coun
try in a mighty flood. The water* now
along the whole stretch from New Madrid
to Helena are flush with the tops of the
levees and the number of breaks above
and below Memphis, as far as known, al
ready exceed those of any previous flood.
The bench mark on the levee at Mem
phis is 224 feet above the level of the river
at its mouth, and th<Â» summit of Crowleys
Ridge, the nearest high land on the west,
is a few feet higher. Between the two the
surface of the land varies from five to fifty
feet, as is to be seen from the accompany
ing contour and an idea can be formed of
tlie present condition of things from the
measured depth of high water at vnriou3
points on a previous occasionâ lÃ6Bâ by
the Government engineers. This flood
section iÂ« separated at the river from the
much smaller Cairo section by a ridge of
land running nearly north and south at
>ew Madrid. But very highlwater in the
upper basin nnds its way around the
: ridges and reaches the lower through St.
I Marys Lake and St. Francis River on the
I webt and Reel foot, lake ana river on the
east side
The stream now flowing through Reel
foot Lake is said to exceed in volume that
of the main stream itself between the
Madrid bluffs and to threaten a per
manent diversion of the channel. From
the mouths of Reelfoot River to a short
distance below .Memphis the high ground
approaches the Mississippi ana forces the
whole volume 01 water therein over
against the levees on the Arkansas side,
and breaks are bound to occur. Th re is
one redeem me; leature, however, to such
disaster and that is the relief afforded to
the levees below. Below Memphis the
river crosses the low ground until it
touches the Arkansas bluffs at Helena,
distant about twenty miles rom those oa
the Mississippi side, and the flood is in
the main transferred to the low
erounds on the east, tho broad
stretch of which, however, and the nu
merous rivers and bayous tend to lessen
its h<MiÂ»hl and tlie extent of damage with
orriina v floods in all of its upper basins
Tlie i vees, as a rule, i-erve as ample pro
te t on, but with ihe simultaneous hith
floods from the Upper Mississippi and tiie
Oiilo the tax is mready too preat, and still
the only prospect is of further rise before
any fail. With the Arkansas addln~ iv
flood tha disirict below Helena i s "also
destined to great lo^s dii<i snffÂ»rine, bnt in
ca?e there is no hieh yiatfr Â» the Red
Kiver Lonmana below Us ... uth will bo
largely spared, as i.,e Aichai ..aya and
other large bayous can carry off the most
of the surplus water by a short route to
the gult.

Aete York CapiialUt* Going Into the Beef
'>'Â«'i"'i' in Krr.icn.
NEW YORK. N. V., March 25. - A
Times Washington special says: A syn
dicate of wealthy New Yorkers, headed
by Solon Humphreys, who has interested
J. Fierpont Morgan and others, is getting
ready to establish an immense beef-can"
ning establishment in Mexico if the
cattle duties proposed by the Dingley
bill are enacted into a law.
As the law now stands there is a big profit
>" bringing lean Mexican cattle across
the Texas border and fattening them for
the Northern market. The new bill will
shut these cattlo out of our markets ana
compel the Mexican owners to find a new
outlet. Humphreys and his syndicate will
have a million - dollar concession from
Mexico, which they propose to utilize for
cattle-raising purposes, and in connection
with this they propose to put $1,000 000
into a beef cannery. The establishment
they are planning will compete with the
ou put of the Chicago and Kansas City
farms to foreign markets.

SECRET SESSION
ON ARBITRATION
Senators Engage in Debate
Over Amendments to
the Treaty.
Chilton Insists That This Coun
try Shall Sett c Certain
Disputes.
In Future the United States Must Not
Bs Charged With Violating
Treaty Obligations.
WASHINGTON. D. C, March 25.â The
Senate spent two hours and forty minutes
in discussing in secret session the pend
ing amendments to the arbitration treaty.
No special progress was made toward the
final result. Before taking up that mat
ter the quesiion of acting on the appoint
ment of Senators by Governors of States
where the State Legislatures should have
eiected Senators came up in the case of
John A. Henderson, appointed by the
Governor of Florida to nil ihe vacancy
caused by the expiration of the term., ol
Senator Call on the 3d of March.
Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts, as ranking
member of the Committee on Privileges
and Elections (there being a vacancy in
the cbaiimansbip), explained that h-- had
not called a meeting of that committee on
account of the numerous vacancies upon
it; and that was the reason why no action
had been taken in the matter of these ap
pointments, and he indicated i.is hope
that very soon the vacancies on all the
standing committees would be filled.
Henderson's credentials were referred
to the Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions.
After the executive session tha bank
ruptcy bill was taken up and read in full,
and then Nelson of Minnesota offered a
substitute for it which was also read in
full. The reading of the two bills occu
pied an hour and twenty minutes, and
when it was finished the Senate at 4:20
adjourned until to-morrow.
The debate on the arbitration treaty
this afternoon was of short duration.
Chiltoa spoKe for almost an hour on his
amendment to t; c first article, which
amends tnat article so as to provide that
only such matters shall be submitted to
arbitration as the Senate then in existence
may deem proper lor arbitration.
Chi ton advocated his amendment with
a great deal oi warmth, and contended
thai if, as had been asserted, the terms of
the treaty were interpreted as meaning
this, tbere could be no good objection
raised to the insertion of words that made
that interpretation unmistakable. It was
in the interest of clearness, and should be
accepted as such by all friends of the
treaty. Without his modification, Chiiton
said, the United States might in the future
be charged with violating its treaty obli
gations if it refused to submit certain
questions to arbitration when they arose
as matters of difference between "the two
countries. He did not want the United
States to be placed in an embarrassing po
sition of this kind, and deemed it the pan
oJ prudence to make the text of the con
vention so perfectly plain that there could
be no over what it meant or
what the Senate had in mind when the
treaty was agreed to, if it should be
agreed to. The debates were secret, and
in the future the cold, hard text of the
treaty will alone be accepted as tbe ex
pression of what was intended when the
convention was ratified and proclaimed to
the world.
Morgan again spoke in favor of the
amendment and took the occasion to ex
press his displeasure at any proposed
treaty with Great Britain that had tor its
purpose any general scheme of arbitra
tion. The wnole thing is a snare, a pit
fall, but if there were sufficient votes in
the Senate to ratify the convention
Morgan said he wanted it made as
as nearly perfect as possible.
Gray and Lodge questioned Cbflton
tending to show that his conclusions
were erronous. They also injected state
mÂ«nts in support ol the committee amend
ments which had been agreed to as being
sufficient to cover every possible criticism
that could be made against the treaty.
Gray took the floor in opposition to the
Chilton amendment alter Morgan had
concluded, but on desiring to ro on to-day
the Senate came out of executive session
and resumed the consideration of legis
lative business.

RATE-CUTTING
Chicago Board of Trade and
Federal Grand Jury in
Dual Action.
Will Gather Evidence of the
Violation of the Interstate
Commerce Laws.
L-ading Eastern Riiiroads Continue
to Withdraw From Various
Associations.
CHICAGO, 111.. March 25.â The Chi
cago Boara of Irade will, on the Ist of
next month, begin an investigation of
alleged extensive railroad rate-cuttinc on
fjrain going East from this city, and it is
reported that the special committees
which have been appointed will have the
assistance of the Interstate Commerce
Commission and the United States Grand
Jury. The plan is for the commission and
the Board of Trade investigators to meet
at- the same time and pursue a policy of
mutual help, with the object of present
ing to the Grand Jury any evidence of a
violation of the commerce law.
f, If the developments of the dual investi
gation warrant such action a special Fed
eral Grand Jury will be called to consider
the indictment of offending shippers and
railroad men. The Board of Trade di
rectors ordered on investigation after they
had received for weeks vigorous com
plaints from shippers of grain who allege
that' they have been shut out and are un
able to move their grain owine to more
favorable rates of transportation being
given to their competitors by the rail
roads. Lasar Cooper & Co. and Carring
ton, Hanna & Co. are said to be two of
the aggrieved shippers, and willing wit
nesses are said to be on hand to testify
before any tribunal. Tne rate-cutting is
taid to have been done for more than two
months by half a dozen of the ten easi
bo.und lines from Chicago. On corn for
export the rate has been cut two to three
cents a hundred pounds; on all other
grains two cents; on domestic corn five
cents, and two a half to rive cents on all
other domestic grain. 'J he roads are also
accused of manipulating rates by absorb
ing transfer and switching charges.
The Federal officials hope that the in
quiry will disclose criminating evidence
against the alleged beef trust and its rail
road accomplices. The effect of the grain
rate discrimination has been to concen
trate the grain-shipping business here
practically in the hands of three firms,
permitting only two or three others 10
handle a small share of the business.

CHICAGO, 111., March 25.â More with
drawals from railroad traffic associations
came to the headquarters in this city to
day or were made known at the general
offices of the companies. The Chicago and
Northwestern's lawyers advised a sever
ance of official ties with other roads, and
the notice to this effect was received at
the offices of the Western Freight Asso
ciation. The Missouri Pacific, Kansas
City, Fort Scott and Memphis and the St.
Lonis and San Francisco also scut notices
of withdrawal. Several Chicago roads
which have not formally withdrawn in
writing have practically done so by refus
ing to participate in any meeting except
those of an informal discussive character,
such as was held by passenger traffic offi
cials yesterday and to-day at the offices of
Chairman Caldwell.
There was also an informal meeting of
general managers of Western roads in the
office of Third Vice-President Ripley of
the Santa Fe road, at which the future
policy of those roads was talked over in
tbe light of the Supreme Court's decision.
A conference for a similar purpose, except
that it may take definite shape as to the
Jeeal and executive plan of campaign to
be followed, has been called to meet in
this city to-morrow. The participants
will be the counselors and solicitors of the
Chicago roads. None of the associations
here attempted to do anything to-day.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., March 25.â The office
of the Southwestern Traffic Association
was open to-day and routine business
transacted. Secretary Campbell said of
the future: "If the executive officers of

ciation decide that tbe Supreme Court's
decision applies to this organ ization we
will have to suspend operations."
REVIEW OF THE MSCISIOS.
Jtailroatt Men Prepare to Act on the
Supreme Court'm Hitting*.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 25.âPer
haps'the most thorough review of the de
cision against the Trans-Missouri Freight
Association and the most concise Btate
ment of the effects of that decision was
made to-day by former Judge John P. Dil
lon, himself a jurorof note. Judge Dillon
eaid tbat he had the opinion of the ma
jority of the court in the case, but had
not seen the dissenting opinion. He
e'tid :
"Substantially three positions were de
cided by the majority. First, that the
provisions of tbe anti-trust act, so called,
on which the suit of tbe United States
against the Trans-Missouri Freight Asso
ciation was brought, extend to ana eir
brace the business of interstate transpor
tation by railways. Second, that the
particular aereeruontof the eighteen com
panies which constituted the Trans-Mis
souri Freight Association is an agreement
in restraint of interstate trade and com
merce, and therefore violates the provi
sions of the anti-trust act; and, third, that
' the United States has a standing in a court
of equity under that act to enjoin the vio
lation of its provisions in a civil proceed
ing.
â  "The heart of the anti-trust act is the
prohibition expressed in the following
language: 'Section 1. Every contract,
combination in toe form of trust or other
wise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade
or commerce among the several States or
with foreign nations, is hereby declared
to be illegal, and punishable by a fine and
imprisonment as a misdt meanor; and the
Circuit Courts of the United States are in
vested by the act with jurisdiction to
prevent and restrain violations of it. 1 The
case was argued in the Supreme Court by
1 the Attorney-General on behalf of the
Untied States and by Carter, Phelps and
Dillon for the association.
"The association's counsel maintained
that tbe anti- trust act, as shown by the
Congressional history of its passage and
Its language, did not embrace the subject
of railway transportation. They urged
that the interstate commerce act, so
calied. passed in 1887 and amended from
time to time in respects in which it had
been found defective down to the passage
of the ami-trust act, constituted a com
prehensive and minute code of railway
regulation, and that the anti-trust act was
not intended to cover the same subject
matter but was directed against known
combinations which popularly went|under
the name of trusts, such as the steel rail
trust. Standard Oil trust, sugar trust, etc
The interstate commerce act prohibits
pools; but it was admitted in the case
that the tr: ttic agreement in question was
not a pool and did not viola c any pro
vision of the interstate commerce act.
"I will not criticize or discus the
opinion of the court, but I am willing to
state what it decided. On the first point
it decides that all combinations which
are in restraint of trade or commerce are
prohibited by the anti-trust act, whether
in the form of trusts or in any other form
whatever, and that anti-trust act covers
and, in the opinion of the majority of the
court, was intended to cover common car
riers by railroad.
"Then the next point decided by the
court is that the particular agreement
which was before the court, namely, the
agreement which constituted the Trans-
Missouri Freight Association, was an
agreement which violated the Â»nti-trust
act, because, as held by the court, it was
an agreement in restraint of trade or com
merce among the several Slates, as the
court delines tha expression.
"It was admitted in the case that in
point of fact rates established under the
aereement were not unreasonable; also, as
stated above, that it did not establish a
pool either of traffic or of earnings, and
that each company was left free to com
pete for and to get all the business it
could; and it was also admitted that there
was no intention on the part of the com
panies acting under it to violate the stat
ute or secure any other end than to pre
vent rate wars and to establish and main
tain rates.
"I cannot regard the decision of the ma
jority as holding anything less than that
the railroad companies cannot under the
anti-trust act make any agreement, except
possibly with connecting lines, for fixing
or maintaining rates for interstate traffic,
even though such rates are reasonable
and although such incidental restraint as
such agreement might put upon com
merce is a reasonable one. The court
furthermore held that the United States
under the act might bringcivil or criminal
proceedings to enforce its provisions."
R. K. Cable, president of the Rock Isl
and road, who is in New York, said to-day
in regard to the Trans-Missouri [decision:
"I supposeour road will do the same as
the other roads and withdraw from all
traffic associations. Ido not see that un
der the decision there is anything else to
do. The situation is rather gloomy. Rail
road business in the "West is light."
James C. Carter, counsel for the Joint
Traffic Association, to-day received the
full text of the decision, and held a con
ference on the subject with George R.
Blsnchard, the commissioner, and Horace
J. Hayden, the chairman of the board of
managers of the association. Subsequently
Blanchard had a talk with Chauncey M.
Depew, the chairman of the board of con
trol of the association. A meeting of the
lawyers for the different railroads in the
association will be held in a few days,
after which Mr. Depew will call a meeting
of the board of control to consider the
matter. !ur. Carter will appear before the
board of managers to-morrow to advise it
as to its course in the immediate future.
ONE HUNDRED
WERE MASSACRED
Helpless Armenians Vic
tims to Moslem Fury
at Tokat
Most Vigorous Protest Made to
the Porte D 7 the British
Embassador.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Tubket, March
25. â Further and possibly more accurate
details of the recent massacres of Ar
menians at Tokat, in the Sivas district of
Anatolia, have been received at the Ar
menian patriarchate here.
The first report of the affair was issued
by the Government. This declared that
fifteen Armenians and three Mussulmans
had been killed. Little reliance was
placed in tbe report, tor tbe officials have
always made it a rule to underestimate
the number of persons killed in the vari
ous massacres. Later information was re
ceived at the embassies showing tbat
fully 100 defenseless Armenians had fallen
victims to the fury of the Moslems at
Tokat, and this number, it was thought,
was pr bably correct.
The news received to-day at the patri
archate shows that these figures were ob
tained from reliable persons at Tokat and
vicinity, nnd that tbe number of victims
stated is without doubt correct.
Sir Philip Currie, the British Embas
sador, made a most vigorous protest
against tbe massacre in a note to the
PortÂ«.
The note was said to have been the
strongest ever delivered by an Embassa
dor to the Turkish Government. Tbe re
sult of his action was shown to-day when
the Sultan ordered tbe dismissal and im
mediate arrest of the Turkish officials at
Tokat who are suspected of complicity in
the massacre and the appointment of a
special commission to try trem.
It is believed tbat tbe British Embassa
dor will watch the trial closely to see that
it does not prove a farce, as so many
trials of Moslem officials charge i with the
murder of Cnristians nave been.
Tbe Armenian Patriarch also made a
protest to the Sultan against the murders
Â«t Tokat, and ha* added force to his pro
test by insisting that the Sultan shall ac
cept his resienation, which was tendered
some lime ago. At that time the Sultan
refused to accept it and promised the
Patriarch that further concessions would
be made to the Armenians. His Majesty
aslced, however, that the granting of these
concessions bs deferred until after Easter.
Tbe massacre at Tokat followed.
Eight Armenians were arrested here to
day as measure of precaution, the Govern
ment fearing that the news of the Tokat
massacre mijilu precipitate an outbreak.
The prisoners are suspected of having
been encaged in an attempt to make a
demonstration here.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 25.â The
See Yaps have won their light against the
Sam Yuds. They are jubilant to-night
and celebrating their victory in true Ori
ental style. Their representatives have
had several confeiences of late with the
Chinese Minister and went over the whole
ground with him.
To-night Yang Yn sent for Attorneys
Campbell and Keough, who represent the
See Yups, and they had a conference with
the Minister and his counsel, Hon. John
W. Foster, ex-Secretary of State under
Harrison. T c MiniÃter acknowledged
that he had taken an erroneous position
with respect to this controversy, and now
wished to say that all would be well if
the See Yups would declare off their boy
cott against the Sam Yups and dismiss
their injunction against the Chinese Con
sul-General at San Francisco which was
brought before Judge McKenna.
The Minister said they need not dis
solve their corporations nor pay him any
money. He said that if they would agree
to these terms he would immediately tele
graph the Chinese Government to declare
off all the suits against the seventeen men,
who were given various sentences. Two
were sentenced to death and the others to
banishment and confiscation of properly.
The See Yups agreed to this, and the
Minister then gave each of the ten China
men a certificate of good character.
Attorneys Campbell and Keoueh say
that the effect of Yang Yu's decision will
be to stop all further highbinding and
boycotting for some time to come. The
party will leave for Sau Francisco on Sat
urday.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 18.â In
response to a Senate resolution the
Civil Service Commission to-day sent to
the Senate copies of all its orders, etc., re
lating to the application of tbe civil
service rules to the operation of the Engi
neering Department under the War De
partment. This class was put under the
civil service by President Cleveland May
6, 1896. The commission at some length
sho ?'s what tbe law is and how persons are
employed and adds that so far as tbe com â 
mission is concerned there has been no
cause for embarrassment in filling vacan
cies or in carrying on the operations in
charge of ihe department. With respect
to the !u. ure the commission sayj it does
not see how the provisions of the civil
service rules can interfere with or embar
rass the operations of the department.
The commission says tbat it believes
when its plans have been perfected the
operations of the Engineer Department
wnl be conducted in a better manner than
under tbe old system.
188 DUTK OH COAL.
Proposed to Make It Reciprocal With
That of Canada.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 25.â The
Republican members of tbe Ways and
Means Committee are informally consid
ering an amendment to tbe tariff bill
which will reduce the duty on coal from
75 cents to 60 cents per ton. The Cana
dian duty on coal is 60 cents a ton, and
the intention of the committee is to make
the duty reciprocal. It is argued that the
superior quality of tbe American coal i<Â»
in itself a veritable protection aeainst the
Nova Scotia product.
The Republican members of the com
mittee are also considering the advisabil
ity of changing tbe paragraph relating to
strawboards, upon wh.ch a straight fluty
of 20 per cent was fixed in the bill. It was
proposed to write in an additional para
graph having especial reference to straw
boards dyed and painted, and on these
increasing the duty 5 or 10 per cent, prob
ably the latter.

JAPANESE GOLD STANDARD.
Senator Wolcott Says It Wilt Hasten the
Establishment of an International
Monetary Basis.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 25.âCon
cerning the recent action of Japan in
adopting the gold standard Senator Wol
cott, who has but recently returned from
abroad, after interviews relating to the
proposed international monetary confer
ence on behalf of this Government, this
afternoon said:
"The monetary situation in Japan is not
only interesting but most far-reaching,
and perhaps not generally understood.
The result which Japan seeks is to make
permanent the depreciation of silver in
relation to gold, and to preserve thereby
the advantages which this position natur
ally gives to Japanese agriculture and
Japanese industries, and is not in any
sense at) attempt to equalize values.
"There was a. time in the history of the
United States when we might have taken
a step identical wiih that which Japan
now proposes. U, during the years of our
Civil War, when our money was worth
but. 50 per cent of the gold ollar, we had
by law declared that henceforth our dol
lar should be of the value of 50 cents only,
in gold, our legislation would have been
parallel with that which Japan evidently
mtunds. We chose to follow a different
path.
"The action of Japan accords in a
measure with that of Austria a few years
since and with the action projected in
Russia, with this . difference: Austria
forced the permanent depreciation of its
money, measured in gold, to the extent of
some 16 per cent; Russia will establish a
reduction of about 33 per cent in the value
of its rouble, while Japan proposes to per
manently depreciate its exchange, relative
tfl gold, so as to lower the value of the
yen to about 48 cents on the dollar.
"The action of Japan must not be con
strued as an attempt to establish and
maintain a gold standard; it is simply an
attempt to preserve the economic advan
tages which sba at present enjoys because
of the gold premium which exists in
Japan, and this at the expense of the
great commercial countries of the world
which have heretofore maintained the !
stability of their coinage as well as their
financial integrity.
â¢'Of course, at the present price of silver,
measured by gold, the result of the action
of Japan would be to drive all its silver
out of that country. It is premature,
however, to attempt to forecast the full
effect of her action in this respect.
"The course of Japan must, in my opin
ion, only serve to hasten some agreement
between the leading commercial nations
of the world looking to a settlement of
this question upon an international basis."

GRANT MONUMENT PARADE.
Marines and Sailors of North Atlantic
Squadron Will Participate in the
Inaugural C remomes.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 25.â Flag-
Lieutenant Hugo Osterhaus reported yes
terday at the headquarters of the Grant
Monument inaugural parade, at 1 Broad
way, representing Admiral Bunce of the
North AUantic squadron. He announced
to General Dodge that the North Atlantic
tquadron, now cruising in the South,

and that the entire squadron would take
part in the naval parade. The marines
and sailors of all vessels will land on the
morning of April 27, and with those from
the navy-yard at Brooklyn march with
the land parade. This will make as large
a naval force as ever paraded in the city
on a similar occasion.
General Dodge has addressed a letter
to Secretary of the Interior Bliss asking
for tbe same representation of the Carlisle
Indians that took part in the inaugural
parade in Washington. The delegations
from public, private and parochial schools
and military academies as estimated by
Captain E. L. Zalinski, who has been ap
pointed to tbe command of this division
of the parade, will number between 5000

Applications for positions in the parade
have been received from Major Warren R.
Dunning, J. S. A. (retired) for 127 cadets
from tbe New YorK Military Academy at
Cornwall, for 1000 men of the Grand Army
Association of Westchester County, and
for 175 men of the Third Virginia Volun

Found Drowned in a Catch Satin.
CHICAGO, 111., March 25.â Grew some
evidence of an untimely and violent death'
was revealed by the finding of the bead
less trunk of a man in a catch basin on
the County Poor Farm this afternoon.
Peter Hengle, assistant foreman of the
grounds, while removing the lid of a
large catch basin, discovered the body
floating in the water. The basin is lo
cated midway between the insane build
ing and the poorhouse of the Dunning in
stitution. An inxuest was held this even
ing and a verdict was returned that the
unknown man met his fate by drowning.
Stories of the attendants at the institu
tion agree that the catch basin rarely con
tains enough water to drown a man.

MR. HUNTINGTON
SLEPT AT FRESNO
Taking Out Ail Heavy
Grades of the Line to
New Orleans.
Says He Was Not Surprised at
the Harbor Commission's
Decision.
President of the Southern Pacific Will
Be Here To-Dayâ ln Good H-alth
and Spirits.
FRESNO, Cal., March 25.â Collis P.
Runlington, president of the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company, arrived here to
night from Washington, D. C, on his spe
cial train of five coaches. He is on his
annual tour of inspection, and is accom
panied by several prominent ofliciais of
the road and a number of ladies. Yester
day afternoon he visited San Pedro, and
on his return trip to Los Angeles stopped
at the new sugar town, Los Alamitos.
Last evening he made a departure from
his usual cui-tom of not traveling at night
and went to Banta Monica. There the spe
cial train was placed on the sidetrack and
Huntington consented to see newspaper
men. He pretended dense ignorance con
cerning the harbor matter, but talked vol
ubly and humorously.
"I understand," said he, "that the re
port has been made on the harbor ques
tion. I have not read it yet, but in time
when I get to San Francisco, wnich will be
in a few daysâ l shall read it, study up
the law and decide what I snail do."
"You know there is nothing so good as
quiet work. I don't trouble myself about
yesterday or to-morrow. I simply work
by daylight, and when to-morrow comes
it is to-day."
"Do you intend to fight the decision as
to the harbor?
"No; I am not fighting anything."
"Will you bid on the construction of
the harbor?"
"Well, that belongs to the to-morrow.
It is not advertised yet. We're out for all
business in our line. This harbor matter
may be settled to-morrow. It is in the
executive department of the Government,
and when they've perfected their plans
whatever they decide on will go. I am
not interfering with the Government.
This report, as I understand it, contem
plates the expenditure of a great deal of
money. Tlie appropriation is for $2,
--900,000, but it will take a great deal more
than that."
"How about the affairs of the Central
and Union Pacific?"
"Central Pacific is all well enoughâ not
in default. Thu Union Pacific is settling
vp â going to be sold out. I think the set
tlement whereby the Government gets
128000,000 is a good and satisfactory
one."
"Do you contemplate extending the
line to San Diego?"
"Well, there's nothing new about San
Diego. It's a plucky town. I don't think
of extending the line now. but we may do
it. We're common carriers and go where
ever there is business. The work on the
coast line from San Luis Obispo to Santa
Barbara is going on all the time and the
road will be finished this year. Our
roads are in good condition, especially be
tween here and New Orleans, and is the
best service in the United States. We are
taking out some of the heavy grades, and
expect that this year we won't haye any
more than a 1 per cent grade."
When asked if W. F. Herrin, counsel of
the road, was candidate for United States
Circuit Jud^e, vice Judge M<Kenna, Mr.
Huntington said: "No, he's not a candi
date. He would make a good Judge, and
is a very able man."
"Were you not surprised at the decision
of the Harbor Commission ?"
"No," retorted Mr. Huntington, "not
very much. The make-up of the commis
sion was somewhat strange. I am told,
however, that Colonel Morgan is a good
man."
In reply to a final question as to bis
action regarding San Pedro, Mr. Hunting

LOS ANGELES MONTE CARLO.
Games and Sports of Ancient Greece and
Rome to Be Revived in a Big
Athletic Park.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 25.â An
atthletic park of immense proportions, in
wbicb it is proposed to revive the games
and sport 9of ancient Greece and Rome,
will soon be laid out by the Pasadena and
Pacific Blectric Railway at the hamlet of
Garvanza, midway between this city and
Pasadena. The most elegant buildings
will be erected, and a fine gymnasium is
already being planned. The exact site of
the buildings has not yet been determined
upon, but the ground comprises all the
valley in the vicinity of the 60-foot-higb
Santa Fe bridge. It is also said that J. B.
Maynes will build a $200,000 hotel. This
caravansary will rival in completeness
and beauty anything yet standing in
Southern California. The architecture
will be of the old mission style, and it will
be an immense rambling structure. The
intention of the whole gigantic plan will
be to the establishment and the operation
of a second Monte Carlo.

Golden Sequel to an Old Quarrel Be
tween Two Brother*.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 25.â
Stephen Gale, who lives in the foothills
north of Pomona, has had a strange
fortune come to him from a long-separated
brother. Gale had for years been living
in a poor little shack and raising lima
beens and other truck for his living. He
and his brother, Daniel W. Gale, quar
reled and lie struck out for the North
west. He never wrote but once to his
brother. He drifted down the coast and
tin aiy came to Pomona in 1878. Daniel
W. Gale rtied in Chicago recently, leaving
a great deal of wealth, and left a request
that his brother, if found, be cared for. He
was found, but could not be persuaded to
return to Chicago, so it was arranged to
provide for him to spend his reclining

that such a widespread and generous reception
would be tendered us, surpassed our highest
anticipation. The multitude which thronged

San Francisco and vicinity toward us. Such

Sad Plight of the Man H ho Laid Out
I.nnrt Jteaeh.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March . 25.â A
peculiarly sad case of want and destitu
tion was presented to the Associated
Charities here to-day. People in many
parts of California will remember John
Wilmore, the man who laid out Long
Beach, . which f was then called Wilmore
City, and put the land on the market. He
was rich and influential once, but now he
is poor, very poor, and sick. For some
time he has been an inmate of the County
Farm. He is 52 years old and broken in
purse and health. Some years ago he
suffered from sunstroke and well-nigh lost
his reason. His mind has cleared up a
little of late, however, and now he wants
to go to New Mexico and has asked the
county to pay for his transportation.
Wilmore recognizes his former associates
in business when he. sees them, but most
of them pass him by, giving no sign of
former acquaintanceship. The associa
tion will make an effort to comply with
Wilmore's wishes. *

BRIGHT PROSPECTS
FOR SANTA CRUZ
Charming Summer Resort
With Fine Commercial
Advantages.
Is the Distributing Point for a
Country Famed for Its
Rich Soil.
Future Business Certain to Grow
With the Expansion of the
State's Commerce.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March' 25â In
spite of the fact that Santa Cruz is far
famed as a summer resort incomparable
in the surroundings and scenic grandeur,
the city by the sea is also likely to become
a thriving city with far more stir and evi
dence of commercial life than it now pos
sesses.
It is the pride of the residents of Santa
Cruz to-day that no summer resort in the
world is more pieasine to the thousands
wtio visit it each year. However, the
beauties of the mountains and the fclory
of the breaking surf cannot bide the com
mercial spirit, which crops out in spite of
scenic grandeur. The possibilities of the
town and county were carefully studied
and eloquently portrayed a few years ago
by Mrs. Boston, who was one of the com
missioners to the Midwinter Fair. She
ably contended that the resources of this
small but fertile region were sufficient to
put it- in the front rank in competition
with far more ambitious centers. Indeed,
it seems quite natural that Santa Cruz
should become quite an important city,
because the peculiar conditions surround
ing it make it the participant of whatever
glor;es come from land, sea or sky as well
as the beneficiary of the advantages of
rich soil and diversified resources-
In every State or kingdom there are a
few cities that one can never forget.
Something in their location or architec
ture causes them to stand out in memory
beyond all others with lasting elements.
It is the opinion of travelers, no matter
what parts of tbe world they have visited,
â¦hat Santa Cruz is beyond ail question
one of the most picturesque and charming
spots in the world.
One of the great advantages of this beau
tiful seaside resort is that it is reached by
two lines of railroad and by steamer. The
broad gauge runs through a rich region of
fertile farms, while the narrow gauge in
tersects a country as rare for its scenic
gardens as for the fertility of its resources.
In all that goes to make a residence city
charming Santa Cruz is up to the times.
It has an electric road, bituminous pave
ments, good water worksâ one system
owned by the city, the other system owned
by a private company â and two telephone
companies supply it with a thorough
service.
Though one of the very smallest coun
ties in the State Santa Cruz is fertile in
those rich and diversified facilities which
make important commercial centers. The
amphitheater, formed by mountains and
bay, mates Santa Cruz the Keystone
county of the State, and its beautiful capi
tal is as picturesque as a painter's dream.
A study of conditions as they confront
one to-day is encouraging, the prospects
of municipal growth being good. A num
ber of improvements designed to increase
the city's importance are already outlined
and ara likely to go forth without inter-
ruption.
Shipping and railway facilities are very
great, and local manufactures are exported
annually in large quantities. When it is
considered that Santa Cruz and its suburbs
contain a population of more than 10,000
it is wonderful to contemplate the output
of its many manufacturing industries &od
the number of families that gain sub
sistence therefrom.
There are powder works, tanneries,
(treat rock quarries, lime kilns and like
enterprises in or near the beautiful city by
thÂ« bay. There are large annual exports
of bitumen, lumber and beet sugar, the
latter from the great Watsonville factory.
There is ample clay for pottery, glue lor
commercial export, and a large export of
soap every year, while the paper-mills of
Boqael are famous for their product. At
the California Powder Works they can
make 1000 kegs of explosives every day,
while the possibilities of tne wave motor
at Capitola have already attracted the at
tention of the world.
The viticultural and agricultural ex
ports are famous for their quality, and
come of the wines made in the mountain
vineyards have given the county a repu
tation even beyond the United States.
All of these manufactures and great
crops would be next to useless were it not
for the fact that Santa Cruz has unsur
passed facilities for snipping them to the
large markets of the world. Being but
eighty miles from San Francisco, it is
only a few hours from the county : s rich
fields and quarries to the ships of the
Pacific, not to speak of those that come to
the harbor of Santa Cruz.
There are many industries flourishing
In the country contiguous to the .city.
The tanneries in thtÂ» outlying districts
produce the best leather made in the
State, toe great sawmills cut lumber for
use as far away as the gold mines of
Africa, the orchards ship the best apples
that grow in the Golden West, while the
vineyards grow wines now becoming
famous wherever good wines are drunk.
A fact that is to be of great importance
is tbat the bay here abounds in many
varieties of fishes useful in commerce, the
salmon fisheries being famous. There are
rockcod, green and spotted trout, perch,
many varieties of mackerel and sea bass,
bluefiili and jewnsb, smelt, raiubow and
GENERAL BIRDSEYE VIEW OF THE BEAUTIFUL SEASIDE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ.
spotted trout, many kinds of herring and
sardines, and other fishes as numerous as
any that dwell in the mighty sea. Some
day there may be canneries here which
will supply a large part of the United
States with food products from the ocean.
A great deal of the prosperity of Santa
Cruz is yet to come from its mineral
wealth, great lime deposits, rock quarries,
timber and other products of the soil.
The resources are as great as the county's
variety of scenery in mountains and val
leys. Some of the mountainsides are
wonderfully fertile, producing a luxurious
growth of nearly everything that thrives
in the north temperate zone.
Almost one-third of Santa Cruz County
is densely covered with limber, while the
farming lands now occupy about one
fourth of the area of the county, whicfc is
but twelve miles wide. Much of the
county is tillable and particularly fertile,
the Pajaro Vailey being particularly rich.
Ttiose who have studied the situation
most carefully believe that when Santa
Cruz becomes much larger than it is now
there will be unexcelled opportunities for
poultry and dairy larming. Much of the
county is admirably adapted to such uses,
and when the population becomes suffi
cient to consume a larger product hun
dreds of persons will doubtless engage in
these productive enterprises. Another
fruitful source of commercial profit will be
the growing of fruits, nuts, cereals ano
vegetables. It is probable that many
people will nud remunerative employment
in raising apples and table grapes, for
these crops tnrive here in a manner pe
culiar to the county. There is a delicacy
ot flavor in these fruits not found in those
ironi other locations.
Editor McPherson of the Sentinel re
cently grouped the products of the county
in the following succinct manner:
"The principal products include wine,
brandy, lumber, cord wood, poultry, eegs,
butter, cheese, wheat, fruit, wool, bheep,
hay, sugar beets, su^ar, asphaltum,
powder, lime, granite, rock for Duilding
and paving, leather, paper, soap, glue and
other manufactured products, besides
welt estsolished fisheries along the bay."
Direct lines ot railroad connect Santa
Cruz with San Jose, Oakland, San Fran
cisco, Monterey, Gilroy, Salinas and all
points south. The narrow gauge trav
erses a wonderful forest of redwood,
passing through the ianious Big Tree
Grove, a never to be forgotten ride through
the heart of the Santa Cruz Mountains.
The broad gauge extend? along the bay
and arounu me mountains by way of
Watsonviile.
Santa cruz has always taken a just pride
in the public school system. As a result
the schools are second to those of no
o; her city. More than 2000 pupils are
rejiiftered. Graduates from the High
School are admittel to the State Univer
sity without further examination.
The Call is enabled to reproduce a co
pious extract from one of the best short
descriptions ever written of Santa Cruz
County. It appeared in Meyrics's Hand
book a few years ago, but the volumes are
now very rare. Tne pertinent portions of
the description are as follows:
"Santa Cruz County, of winch the city
of Santa Cruz is the county seat, has an
area of a little over 300,000 nores, about
one-third beir.Â£ lertile valley plateau and
rolling hill 1 and and at least 40,000 Acres
bottom land of a very rich description.
"The county has some fifty miles of
coast aloug the ocean and the bay of Mon
terey, running oack to the summits of the
Santa Cruz range of mountains and form
ing a view of almost perfect aspect, facing
the sea on the south and protected from
northwest to east by high, well-wooded
hills, the highest point. Loma Prieta,
risins some 4uC'O feet, above the sea, the
wholo area being in full enjoyment of a
south-southeast 10 west exposure.
"High ridges and small valleys, gorges
ana cunyons run down from the moun
tains, partly ciotned in redwood, pine, tir
and various evergreens, as well as oak,
maple and many other varieties of decidu
ous trees.
"Scattered through this mountain forest
region are many lumber mills and small
agricultural settlements, many of the lat
ter more or less devoted to fruit and wine
growing. Many of the orchards and vine
yards are still in their inlancy, but every
one gives proof taai'all the valuable fruits
of temperate and semi-tropical latitudes
will grow in great perfection on these hill-
Bides and will very soon cover sufficient
area to warrant the starting of large fruit
canning and drying establishments."
The people ot this charming seaside re
sort are studying tbe art of iiving for en
joyment. Less dreamy than the Hawaiian
nobility ot classic Waikiki, the people do
not exhibit the spirit of hurry and worry
common in otner towns. While noi for
getful ot tbe advantages of business in
a commercial age the people are devoting
considerable ol their leisure to culture,
and Santa Cruz may yet become an im
portant educational center as well as the
Newport of tbe .Puctnc Coast. The public
library is one of the important institu
tions of the city. There are more than
10,000 volumes pn the shelves and tne
patrons exhibit great judgment and rare
good taste in the quality of literature they
peruse.
Climatologists who have studied the
conditions of this county pronounce tbe
climate one of the best in the world. Few
diseases have any bold here. Less ener
vating than ports farther tooth Santa Lruz
is still a temperate climate, especially in
vigorating in the summer months. As the
population and general importance of the
State grow Santa Cruz is sure to become a
fashionable watering place as well as a
commercial center by far of more import
ance than it nus yet attained.

PORTLAND STEAMER'S MISHAP.
Strikes an Ugly Overreaching Snag on the
Skamckawa Sloughâ Panic Among
the Passengers.
PORTLAND, Or., March 25.â As tne re
sult of an encounter with a large snag
overreaching the bank of Skamokawa
Slough during yesterday's run to Astoria,
the steamer Lurline arrived back in Port
land in a sadiy damaged condition, so far
as her upper works are concerned. The
accident occurred while the Lurline was
working slowly duwn 'he slough, whicn* is
tortuous in the extreme. The night was
very dark and as the steamer rounded a
head the snag caught her fair amidships
and on a level with the saloon deck. The
big timber pushed its way through the
siile of tiie cabin, tearing out four state
rooms, and tnen taking a slant upward
pierced the floor of the pilot-house, emerg
ing ilirough the sids of that structure.
Considerable time was reauired to clear
away the wreck, it being necessary to cut
the snag through in three places to get it
overboard. When the steamer struck
there arose an immediate panic among the
passengers, some of them so completely
losing their presence of mind as to attempt
leaping into the river. Captain Gray
soon allayed the excitement and no one
wa3 hurt.

Arguments Presented to
the Railroads for a
Reduction.
The Mammoth Petition in the
Hands of the O.ficials for
Consideration.
Mario County's Plea for the Purpose
of Increasing Is Population
and Wealth.
BAN RAFAEL, Cal., March 1 25.â The
mammoth petition of the people of San
Rafael nas been duly presented to the
railroad companies running between the
Metropolis and the county Beat of Marin,
and with the petition a written argu
ment was presented to the directors, and
the decision of the companies is eagerly
awaited.
The San Rafael people are striving to
secure a rednction of the far* between
their city ana San Francisco with the
hopes that a lower rate will attract the at
tention of outsiders to the desirability of
Marin County as a place of residence.
In the argument presented to railroad
directors the committee in charge of the
people's petition says in part:
Tho general proposition tnat lower fares
would tend to increase the population of the
territory tributary 10 your roads cannot be con
troverted. No one familiar with the history
of our own and neighboring towns can doubt
that our superior natural advantages have
been neutralized by thopolicv of the Southern
Pacific Company in reducing fares and thereby
ranking point* on their roads more accessible
than Shu Kaiael.
The people of Oakland and Berkeley visit
San Francisco three times as of leu as the resi
dents of San Rafael because tbeir round-trip
tickets cost them but 20 cents as against 50
cents for ours.
The best way to impress upon strangers the
many advantages of our beautiful city is to
afford tiiem inexpensive facilities for personal
We depend on your business sense to realize
that a large number of plain people at $3 per
mourn mnst give your road ft larger revenue
than a few exclusiyes at $5 per month.
It will be impossible to get any considerable
increase In population without ihe reduction
asked for, because incomes and prices have
been materially reduced and very few can
afford to ignore the difference iv rates, which
can be annuaiiy saved by locating somewhere
on tne line of the Southern Pacific. We have
many attractions to urge upon people teeking
homes, but none will prove effective so ions
as the initial obstacle of a high fare prevents
people from becoming familiar with them.
The present rate of fare between San
Rafael and San Francisco over both the
San Frtncisco and North Pacific Railway
and the North Pacific Coast road is 50
cents for the round trip. Commutation
tickets are $5 for men and $3 for ladies.
It is sought to have the companies re
duce the round-trip tickets to 25 cents
and the commutation rates to $3.

FROM FRESNO TO FOLSOM.
Wife- Murderer Rjckws/f Pleads Guilty
and Is Sentenced to Imprison

FRESNO, Cal., March 25.â W. W.
Rockwell will spend the remainder of his
life in the State prison at Folsom as a
punishment for the murder of his wife in
this city on the night of August 1 last.
The prisoner withdrew his plea of not
guilty and entered one of guilty of mur
der in the first degree. He waived time
for the passing of sentence and Judge
Risley fixed the penalty at life imprison
ment.
Rockwell had one trial, in which the
jury disagreed, standing ten for convic
tion and two for acquittal. The prisoner
was afraid that a second, jury might in
flict the capital punishment, and he
therefore offered to plead guilty if as
sured that ihs penalty would be life im
prisonment. In his statement to the
court the prisoner said that one of his
main reasons ;or pleading guilty was to
avoid the notoriety of a second trial. He
has a three-year-old son, whom he wants
to prolect from disgrace, as far as possi
ble, he says. The little one is at present
in Missouri, having been taken in charge
by relatives of Mrs. Ilockwell, the mur
dered wife.
The crime for which Rockwell must suf
fer was an atrocious one. He and his wife
had been quarreling all the evening and
he finally pulled out his pistol for the pur
pose of killing her. She turned and ran

HELD FOR FREIGHT CHARGES.
The Southern Pacific Delays Shipment
Grain for the Famine-Stricken \
People of India.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 25. -A
message being received at the Governor's
office from the chief executive of lowa,
inquiring into the reason of the stoppage
on the part of the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company in the transportation of
the grain donated by the different West*
crn States for the relief of the starving
millions of India, has seemingly brought
to light the fact that the railroad com
pany has refused to transport the grain
until they receive full freight rates in ad
vance. The company has donated the
freight charges on 1000 tons. Governor
Budd wired to San Francisco regarding
the matter and has received the following
dispatches from Hugh Craig and from X.,
D. Perry, secretary of the famine comÂ«
mittee of the Chamber of Commerce:
Filcher asks me to inform you that the pres
ent status is that 3600 tons of corn have been
donated by Nebraska, Kansas and other
Western States. The United States Govern,
merit furnishes free transportation from San
Francisco to Calcutta for 4000 tons. The
Southern Pacific gives free transportation for
1000 tons from Omaha to San Francisco. All
in excess of these donations must be paid for
at regular railroad rates, which means $8000
in gold. This amount, I understand, has beta
guaranteed by New York people.
Perry's dispatch is as follows:
I shall receive $8000 from New York at 5
o'clock to-morrow morning to remove the
stoppage by the Central Pacific of our grain at
Ogden. Tell the Governor of lowa to mako
this very public.
The substance of these telegrams has
been sent to the Governor of lowa by
Governor Budd, so that the people may
know that their generous donations to
India's poor are in a fair way to reach
their destination.HOMES FOR

Commander Booth-Tucker has left by
way of Portland to complete the remain
der of his tour around the world, leaving
the Salvation colony project in the hands
of Major William Wallace Winchell and
his associates. The major will be assisted
in his work by Hugh Craig of the Cham
ber of Commerce and George E. Butler, a
prominent California-street insurance
man, but of benevolent instincts. These
two gentlemen have appointed a commit
tee of rifteen business men. This commit
tee will be an advisory one and will con
sider the practicability of the colony plan
of making Homes for the unemployed.
Mr. Butler has not yet notified them of
their appointment, and for thai reason
cannot make their names public, as some
of them may decline the honor.
Mr. Butler talked favorably of the plan
yesterday. He had found that a similar
plan worked well in Scotland and Ireland,
where a family supported itself on from
ten to twenty-live acre? oi poor land in
a poor Climate. He believed that the time
was ripe to try the experiment in Califor
nia. If it should not prove to be a success
no harm would be done, because the land
would still remain and perhaps be aii the
better by reason of its having been culti
-viite<i. On the other band, if it should
proye to be a success it would co very far
toward solving the problem, "What shall
we do with ihe unemployed?"
"With the comparison so largely in
favor of California," added Mr. Butler,
'â¢which can be made with those countries
where large numbers 01 people support
families on small tracts of land, much of
it far from ferule, and with anything but
desirable climatic conditions, it seems
very desirable to try the experiment of
settling worthy and reliable unemployed
persons on ten-acre lots in this State. If
it can be shown that a living can be ob
tained for families from the soil the worst
feature of the present problem of the un
employed is tnereby solved."
Mru. Winchell, wife of the major, was
busy all day yesterday reading letters
lxoni different parts of the Siate offering
tracts of land for the colony. One of these
offers was a tract of 2270 acres four miles
from Windsor, in Sonoma County, at $4
per acre, half cash and the remainder at 8
per cent. Another was of 900 acres near
Cazauero, a hunting and fishing resort,
where there is enough redwood timber to
keep the unemployed at work for a thou
sand years grubbing slumps. Other
patches or land assessed at $15 were of
fered at $60 per acre. Major W inchell and
the committee know something about
land values, and the scale of prices will be

TWO VOICES FROM SOUTHERN CITIES.
: - .
The .Mayor of Fresno and tlje .Mayor of Santa Barbara on the .New
Constitution.
Santa Barbara, Cal., March 25.
Editor Call: 1 am opposed to the calling of a convention for the framing of
another or a new constitution. The late election has demonstrated that the wople
at large are opposed to unnecessary amendments, even to the old. After the present
constitution was ratified, on the 7th of May, 1879, it took the people ten Jone years
to know "where they were at" by expensive litigation through our State and Federal
courts. t
I am a believer in the adage tnat the people who are governed least are governed
best, and am willing to let well enough alone. In this Ido not wish it to be under
stood that I am opposed ie improvements â local. State or National, but I am opposed
F. M. WHITNEY, Mayor of Santa Barbara.
to extravagant and useless legislative experiments to gratify the curiosity of a few
malcontents whose headlong desire after an impossible happiness can never be
attained.
I believe to cal! a constitutional convention now or in the near future would be
one of the greatest misfortunes that could be brought upon the State of California.
I think we have had agitation enough for some years to come, and as confidence is
being rapidly restored I appeal to our law-makers to grant us a political truce that
we may reacuS our ragged laborers, starving mechanics and bankrupt treasuries from
the swamp into which they have latterly sunk.
If a convention could be convened that would condense our present constitution
by merging the many amendments into the body proper it might be a wise thing to
convene one and after having accomplished that to adjourn. But once assembled
where would it end? We can only judge the future by *.he past.
I cannot see where or how a new constitution would benefit our State, my County
or City, by up*etting wbat lias heen accomplished during these last eighteen years,
which must enevitably be the result, or else the constitution would not be new.
1 must see or be assured of an instrument that will be an improvement, and a lasting
one, on all previous constitutions in tnis and other States before I would consent to
a change in these unsettled times.
scheme is to "try out" the applicants, to
sift the goats from the sheep, ibe drones
from the worker.-. The tittest who survivc
the test will be placed on the tracts of
land'in the country under competent in
structors and will be allowed to work out
their own saivation. Each man will pay
$1 a week toward the purchase of his land
after he gets fairly started. The land will
be paid for by the society at the rate of 5
per cent of the principle and 5 per cent
interest.
It will be necessary to raise a capital of
$25,000 to start the colonies going in ship
shape style. The products will be varied,
and the aim will be to establish a home
market for the ontput of all the larms;
hence it is expected that more poultry
and pore will be turned out than pota
toes.
The method of colonization outlined by
Commander Booth â¢ Tucker and Majo
Winchell is no an experiment.
Tbe same system has been introduced
in England, Australia and elsewhere, and
it hB9 been an unexampled success wher
ever it has been tried. In every colony
there will be a atore and a village bank,
after tne style of those in Germany,
which have never been known to fail.
There will be no iavoritism on the score
of religion. All honest men and women
will be treated impartially alike. The
other kind is not wanted.
The Salvation Army has taken a con
tract to cut several tnousand cords of
wood near Cotati. Ten men have been
sent thither to do the cutting and ten
more will be sent before the week is out.
They will be paid in*wood, which, wnen
sold, will give thun tbe waees due them.

of the army.
There were 405 men at work on the
boulevard yesterday, of which number

55 werp new men, who had just received
their tickets. It is creduab.o to ttie men
at work to state that only two men have
been discharged since the beginning of the
work â one of them for disobeying the
orders of a foreman and the other for
going to sleep in the brush.
Thus far 43U0 feet has been finished in
the eight duys since the work began. The
registrations of workmen applying for
employment on tne boulevard have

SAYS IT WON'T WORK.
Adolph Sutro Says the Plnsrree Plan
Is a Good Thing, but Not
for California.
Adolph Sutro is in favor of the Pingree
DOtato-patch plan in the abstract, bat be
does not think it will work as applied in
this City. He says he has studied the
sys em, and, while he does not want to
discourage Booth-Tucker or those who are
working with him toward this end â the
suburban colony schemes for the relief of
the unemployed â he does not believe they
are practicable for this City, or even for
the State.
â¢Tiie conditions are difterent here from
those in Detroit or Michigan," said Mr.
Sutro in an interview yesterday. "I
know Governor Pingree. He is a big
man and an independent man. I have
great respect for any opinion be may put
iorward. I have studied his system of
putting the unemployed upon the vacant
lota in the city or the unused lands of the
country, but the difficulty in this City
and State is that the land will not produce
without irrigation.
"If it were otherwise the plan proposed
by Mr. Booth-TucKer woald be of Brent
benefit to both the City and to the unem
ployed. I woulil be willing to offer sÂ«me
mud for the purpose, and there are many
others who would do so, but it would be
useless. To get water from the Spring
Valley cost* money, and would cost more
than the value of all the potatoes and cab
bages that they could raiie on the small
tracts. In the Ems; â in Detroit and Michi
ganâthey have rainstorms during the
summer which help the garden truck
through."
It V.-.-5 suggested that Booth-Ticker's
plan contemplated the sale of property to
the parties put upon the land, small in
stallments being required in i>Â»y meat at
low interest.
"They could never pay anything," said
Mr. ftutro. ''They could nut produce more
than enough to iive at best, and not that
without water. These are very poor peo
ple, and the land-owner would simply find
that he had them on his hands. The
scheme com i not work here."

Fresno, Cal., March 25, 1897.
Editor Call: While I have not Riven the matter of a new constitution much
thought, I am decidedly of the opinion that a convention for the purpose of either
framing a new or radically reforming the present one is the most Dressing present
need of the times. Our present constitution was framed at a time anterior to the
beginning of the present industrial progress of California, and is deficient in many
respects. While it contains some wise and beneficent clauses, there are other
restrictive and limiting ones based on narrow and unprogressive lines. '
There has been a wonderful development in California within the last dozen or
fifteen years. Conditions have changed, and to meet the demands of such changes
CJ. CRAYCROFT, Mayor of Fresno.
new laws need to be framed. As our constitution now stands our .Legislatures are
hamp -red, and needed legislation is necessarily limited. To keep pace with the
progress of our neighboring States we need to invite the investment of capital from
n broad, the successful accomplishment of which depends on liberal laws governing
the same. Other States have recently found it necessary to radically change or mod
ify their organic law to accommodate the march of progress. Why cannot we do like
wise?
Some changes should be made in our laws relating to taxation. As for the single*
tax idea, I am not prepared to speak advisedly, not having thoroughly investigated
the same. However, the theory seems to me to be both impracticable afid unjust.
The fundamental idea of our Government has always been that taxation must be uni
lorm and levied on all values, unless exempted by special act of Legislature. lean
see no reason why personal property s ould not b â  taxed as well as realty.
One of the needs of the times is a Criminal Court of Appeals. As at present con
stituted, our Supreme Court is overcrowdej with business, which causes much vexa
tious and costly delay to litigants, clogs the wheels of justice and tends to make Ir.w
a farce. There are other changes in our present constitution just as essential as the
two above mentioned, and it seems to me no time should be lost in calling a conven
tion to form a new constitution or amend the old one.

Ira D. Sankey, the evangelist, leaves
here this morning unexpectedly, suddenly
and finally. His party, consisting of him
self and wife and Mr. and Mrs. Ira D.
Sankey Jr., will hasten to Phoenix, Ariz.,
tnere to remain several weeks. The jour

the party wilt rest to-morrow and where
Mr. Sankey will conduct a rervice of song.
All bis California engagements are
accordingly canceled and his intended
trip to Oregon and the Northwest is
abandoned.
This liasty change was occasioned by
the illness of Mrs. tiankey. It was on her
account primarily ihat the party came to
California in searcn of a warm mild
climate.
Mr. Sankey arrived here from the East
a little over a week ago. He bad planned
to remain antil April 10 and then to visit

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
The war cloud in Europe looks lurid.
Much rain and no frosts to speak of
promise a year of prosperity that will
break the record.
It will be noticed that the tariff debate
this time is not causing any alarm nor
closing any mills.
As the Sultan has begun to buy war
ships it is evident the war talk has meant
business for somebody.
We can well afford to let the arbitration
treaty wait until we find why England is
bo eager to have us hurry it along.
. â  Weyler's telegraph apparatus has lost its
power. It has not succeeded in heading
off a single Cuban victory in a week.
A streetcar conductor in New York City
had a man arrested for spitting on the
floor of a car, and now there is talk of
erecting a monument to him.
There is no shirking among the workers
on the boulevard, and there should De
none among prosperous citizens in sub
scribing to the employment fund.
It will avail Spain nothing to recall
Weyler and leave the rest of her army In
Cuba. If she wishes to save her forces
ehe must get them all out of danger.
The sympathies of the Russian people
are with their fellow-members of the
Greek church, and if the Czar continues
to support the Turks ho may find trouble
ahead.
People who wish to say something good
of Blanther, now that he is dead, can say
be practiced municipal econcny by his
death and saved the City a good deal of
money.
After all the talK of the diplomatists it
fs not yet certnin whether the great
â¢powers intend to take a hand in Cretan
affairs or just put a foot in it and let it go
at that.
The Servian Government explains that
the calling out of the 1 troops of that coun
try was intended only for a week of
maneuvers, and, of course, the explana
tion is satisfactory.
As McMillin of Tennessee declares the
Dingley tjriff will lead to the overthrow
of the Republican party in the next slec
tions it would seem that he is consistent
in asserting that he opposes it in the in
terests of ths country.
It is gratifying to note that the Senate
has taken up the immigration restriction
bili which Cleveland vetoed, and will
make it a part of the legislation of this
session. We need that bill at the same
time as the new tariff, so that cheap labor
can be kept out of the country.
Phoenix, Ariz., rejoices because the in
troduction of the Gamewell fire alarm
system does away with what a local news
paper calls "the time-honored system of
givinc notice of lire by a discbarge of re
volvers.'' As a municipal improvement
this is decidedly noteworthy.
Quite a number of Southern Democrats
are objecting to the Dingiey bill because
it. does not give ail the protection they
wish, and it may possibly be amended to
Emit them. It looks as if there would be
no free-traders in this country hereafter
except among the importers of the big
cities of the East.
It is stated that G3 per cent of the man
ufactured food products of the United
States are adulterated, and yet the people
of this country cannot consume ail the
pure foods they produce. It is clear,
therefore, that we are 63 per cent an on
enlightened people and need a new illu
mination of some kind.
When Grosvenor asked the Democrats
in Congress why they do not offer the
Wilson bill as a substitute for tbe Dineley
tariff he put the whole question in a nut
shell. If the freetraders object so seri
ously to a tariff that will provide a sur
plus-why do they not consistently stand
np for the tariff of deficiency?
Brooklyn looks as-kance at the greater
New YorK scheme because it would mean
the domination of her politics by the New
Yorker, and New York hesitates because
tbe consolidation would mean the settle
ment of about $6,000,000 of the debt of
Brooklyn on the New York taxpayers. In
this position the two communities glare at
each other, and to call them "sister cities"
is to do an injustice to family affection.
At a meeting of the Retail Grocers' As
sociation on Wednesday evening it was
stated that instances are known of boxes
rent out by wholesalers stamped "cotton
seed oil" which contained tins of oil
marked with labels certifying tbe con
tents to be olive oiL In these instances
the fraud is apparent and there ought to
be no difficulty in suppressing that kind
of practice if the retailers would co-oper
ate with the Board of Health in an effort
to do so.
For a number of years the average an
nual cost to Chicago for removing dead
animals from the city has been about $37,
--500, but now a contract has been made by
which the contractor agrees to remove the
carcasses to a point three miles beyond
the city limits and pays $5 a year for the
privilege. It is estimated that during the
five, years for which the contract is to run
the city will save $187,500, and that is cer
tainly a very good showing for dead horse
economy.
THE TARIFF DEBATE.
The debate on the tariff between Gros
venorof Ohio and McMillin of Tennessee
on Wednesday presents the issue as it will
be made up to go before the country. The
two speakers are among the ablest repre
sentatives of their respective parties and
are well fitted to discuss economic ques
tions. What they have said therefore
may be taken as a fair summary of nil
that will be said during the whole course
of the debate.
Mr. McMillin when he began the debate
stated that the new bill is "the most un-
conscionable effort at legislative robbery
ever attempted on the people." He de
clared that a sufficient surplus exists in
the treasury to meet all estimated defi
ciencies for two years, and that the alleged
necessity for the bill is a mere pretext.
Finally he characterized the measure as
one devised in the interests of trusts
rather than of the people and predicted
that the voters woald repudiate it at the
next election.
In these assertions there is nothing
more than the old cry which was raised
against the McKinley bill. Mr. Grosve
nor's answer to every statemen t of Mr. Mc-
Millin was complete. He refuted the
assertion that there is a surplus in the
treasury by the well-known facts that the
money now in the treasury has been ob
tained by tue sale of bonds and reprenents
a debt imposed upon the people. Ever
since the Wilson tariff went into effect
there has been a deficiency, and not even
the supporters of that tariff estimate it
will ever yieM a revenue equal to the
expenditures of the Government.
Two deadly evili, said Mr. Grosvenor,
are upon uu. Our labor is unemployed
and the National treasury is bankrupt.
There can be no business confidence in
this country when tne treasury of the
United States is without revenue to meet
its obligations, and no industrial pros
perity when American labor is exposed to
the unequal competition of cheap labor
abroad.
In summing up the effects of the meas
ure Mr. Grosvenor said the bill provides
for the ultimate expenditure in the United
States of more than $300,000,000 per an
num to the laborers of the country above
that which is now being paid out. Under
its operation the $125,000,000 now sent
abroad every year to buy suuar will be
expended in the United States. Under
the woolen schedules every spindle in the
United States will be set to profitable work.
The farmers of the West and of the South
will be benefited as well as the working
men of the cities. In short, as Mr. Grosve
nor said:
The policy of this bill Is to give to labor the
degree of employment in the United States
which will cause to be expended in this coun
try every dollar that ia expended for such
products of the soil, of tne mine, of the shop
and oi the factory, that we can produca in the
United States on equal terms with the foreign
producer. We propose that this country shall
put itself on a war footing for the purpose of
maintaining itself. We propose that it shall
be in a position to produce its own sugar and
its own wool and its own commodities of every
character that God in his wisdom has made it
posÃible to produce on this continent.
In that statement we have the sub
stance and the Intent of the Dingley tariff.
It is in vain the free-traders rail against it.
The people have had experience with a
tariff of deficit and disaster and cannot
again be deluded into rejecting one that
means ample revenues, protection and
prosperity.
GOOD WORK WELL DONE
The retirement of Julian Sonntag from
the presidency of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association forms a eood op
portunity for reviewing the work of the
organization. What has been accom
plished by the association has been largely
due to the energy and sagacity of tne re
tiring president, and stands as a memorial
of his services to the community.
No association in the City has under
taken a more important work than that
of the manufacturers and producers. Its
object is to build up bone industries, and
in that object all classes of citizens from
capitalists to workingmen are interested.
No greater duty confronts the people of
California at this time than that of de
veloping their home industries, and a
cordial support was given to the associa
tion a3 soon as it had outlined the policy
it intended to pursue and set forth the
ends which it sought to attain.
Although many men of eminence and
ability have given their tipie and services
to the association and have aided it in
many ways by their influence, it is not too
much to say that the bast results which
have bsen achieved by it have been due
mainly to the untiring efforts and wisely
directed energies of President Sonutag.
His spirit has animated the association
from the start, and to his initiative as
well as to his leadership is to be accredited
many of its most notable undertakings
and most beneficial accomplishments.
In reviewing the work of the associa
tion during hia term as president Mr.
Sonntag was able to point out many
benefits attained for the City. Among
these was the fair held in conjunction
with the Mechanics' Institute for the
purpose of displaying home products;
the agitation in favor of pure food, which,
under the direction of the Board of
Health, is now doing so much to break ud
the sale of adulterated food articles in the.
State; the efforts made to limit the em
ployment of convict labor in competition
with free labor; and, finally, the suppres
sion of many obnoxious "cinch bill*' 1
which might have worked serious injury
to some of our most important industries.
It is not strange that the resignation of
President Sonntag was accepted very re
luctantly by the association. It will be
difficult to find a man to fill the place with
an equal zeal, energy and sagacity.
Nevertheless the association has now
been well started, the outline of its work
laid upon broad policies and the en
thusiasm of a genuine public spirit in
fused into it. The incoming president
will have tbe advantage of all that has
been accomplished by Julian Sonntag to
assist him in his work, and it is an easy
prediction that tno association will go
forward as it has begun and continue to
serve the public interests as well as it did
under its first president.
BUSSIA AND GBEEOE.
If it is possiblo to judge the real inten
tions of European Governments by such
statements as are made public and by
overt actions then it is clear that the
power which stands in tbe way of the an
nexation of Crete to Greece is Russia.
The Governments of Western Europe, and
particularly those of England and France,
are too much subject to public opinion to
defy the liberal spirit of Europe for the
maintenance of the Turkish empire of
their own will. It is nothing but the fear
of a war with Russia, possibly aided by
Germany, that impels them to act as they
have done.
It is to Russia the world must look for
the dominant factor in the problem of the
Levantine crisis. Unless something oc
curs to change the policy of the Czar the
uprising in Crete will end in some form of
compromise which will eetile nothing and
serve no other purpose than that of post
poning a general European war. It is in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. MARCH 26, 1897.
terestine, therefore, to consider whether
the Czar's Government will beable to hold
on its way in support of the Turks or
whether there may not arise in Russia
itself !=orne power sufficiently strong to
compel the autocrat either to aid the
Greeks or at least to withhold his hand
from assisting the Turks.
The issue is not a new one in Russian
history. Early in the century when the
Greeks began their war of independence
the Czar Alexander, for certain diplomatic
reasons, refused to give them any aid or
countenance. Toe Czar was at that time
the popular hero of the Russians. It was
under his rule they had overthrown the
great Napoleon, and the people revered
him almost as if he were divine. Never
theless so strong was Russian sympathy
with their fellow- members of the Greek
church that powerful conspiracies were
organized throughout Russia to dethrone
the Czar or assassinate him solely because
he refused aid to what the Russian peas
ants called "our Greek brothers."
Ihe strength of tnese conspiracies was
so great that the Russian Government
was at last compelled to act In alliance
with the English and the French for the
purpose of establishing the independence
of Greece. What happened once may
happen again. Russia has no Parliament,
but neveriheless her stubborn people have
a way of making their Czars understand
their wishes, and the autocrat who holds
on his way in opposition to the popular
will has generally died very suddenly.
Meantime it is clear the King of Greece
has confidence that the power of the peo
pie throughout Europe is working for him
against the Governments of the nations.
The Athenian newspaper which is recog
nized as the official organ of the King
declares "The Cretans reject autonomy
which their King rejects also, and will
accept only the one solution upon which
the Greeks and the Cretans are agreed.
Every effort exerted by the rowers in
Creie will have its counter stroke on the
frontier and beyond." This is a clear
note of defiance, and perhaps the Czar,
powerful tnough he be, may find it wise
to give heed to the warning.
THE REAL IMPRESSION.
To thoroughly appreciate the blessing
which tne building of the boulevard con
| fers upon so many needy laborers one
| should drive through the park some even
ing when the men are wending their tired
march homeward from work. Indeed, it
is impossible to comprehend the real hu
man side â the vital side â of the affair
without witnessing this daily ingathering
of the faithful toilers and marking the ex
pression of their faces, the spirit of their
footsteps and the general air of fraternal
providence which hovers over them.
It is very gratifying to sit in our break
fast-rooms and felicitate ourselves and
eacn other upon the generosity of those
whose contributions to the relief fund we
read of in the morning papers, but this is
merely the picturesque view of that splen
| did benevolence. Impressions conceived
through mere assurance, however reliable
and agreeable to the belief, are not the
vivid realization of actual observa
tion. It is the indescribable essence
iof the thing which appeals to you
when you actually see the living condi
tions as you face the boulevard builders
in the park, and this does not appeal to
you when you read of the noble response
that our citizens are making to those
laborers' appeals for aid, day by day. The
things that you read are essentially de
scnbable and material â the impressions
tuat you derive from seeing the recipients
l in the very act of enjoying the good that
you read of are sentimental and morally
elevating.
What would the whole community of
San Francisco give to this fund if every
well-to-do man in it went forth and viewed
the homing band at eventide, and were
confronted by the great moral lesson
which it silently yet so eloquently
teaches? The Call has scarcely enough
columns to hold the figures that would be
necessary to tell the wondrous tale.

Oh, I know a land where the Wlllywlc grows,
Where the blossom-bird plays with his bill,
Where the Butts stroll about with rums on their

And the Moon mates her home on the hill.
She watches the children, the pretty old Moon,
From her castle unove the 800- Band;
And when she's away on her trip every noon
The Man in the Moon takes a numi.
It's the prettiest country yon ever did see,
This Island far out on the 800,
With iis appie-ereeu sky and lv baby-blue tree;
A landscape just ready for two.
There's a nice little bridge made of marshmallow

O'er a lovely hot chocolate stream;
Silver spoons grow by doieug If you care for Â»

And a pan pan will band you the cream.
There's nothing to fear In this far-away land,
This island juat under the Moon.
So bring all the chi.dr n ; we'll float far away
On the wings of the sweet afternoon.

lhÂ» Clarendon Heights Improvement
Club Urges the Opening of
Seventeenth Street.
The Clarendon Heights Improvement
Glob is urging the opening of Seventeenth
street over the top of Mount Olympus hill,
where it will eventually connect with X
street, which runs in a direct line to the
Pacific Ocean.
The difficulty of grading Seventeenth
street from Uranus to Ashbury is made
much easier than it was at first supposed,
in consequence of an offer from Ferris &
Williams, contractors, who have facilities
for using considerable of the dirt to till in
adjoining property.
At a recent meeting of the improvement
club C. Belzerini stated that in an inter
view with Colonel Fred Crocker, in refer
ence to a transfer arrangement between
the cars of the Castro and Sixteenth and
Fillmore street lines, he felt satisfied that
Colonel Crocker would grant the request.
The people of the district want transfers
issued at Fourteenth and Market streets
from the eastbound Castro- street cars to
tne north and south bound Fillmore and
Sixteenth street cars.

the right to vote in California.
Joornaijsmâ H. C, City. There is no school
in San Francisco in which journalism is
taught.
The correspondent in his communication
writes: "If there Is no such school what is
the best method for a person who wishes to
write articles for publication and yet feels the
need of instruction in the routine or discip
line to acquire the necessary knowledge?"
i\o better answer can be furnished than that
given by an Eastern journalist when asked a
similar question by an intending journalist.
It was as follows:
"There are hundreds of just such young men
who have some 'literary and journalistic
ability,' who try their hand in the field of
literature and journalism only to fall short of
the looked- for, eminence and compensation.
Even with the talent the correspondent thinks
he possesses he will, it is likely, find the way
to a position in the literary world beset with
a thousand difficulties, which nothing but the
closest attention. and the most unremitting
toil will remove. Take a, reporter, for in
stance. A reporter's duties are so numerous
and varied thai only the most careful reader of
i- daily journal can appreciate the many-sided
character of the service. Here is a paper with
the hasty history of the day. We find politics,
city and county affairs,' military matters, re
ligious conventions, Government news, social
events, criminal notes, interviews, articles on
special topics, court proceedings, market re
ports, marine intelligence, sporting news
(such as baseball, cricket, races, both running
and trotting, archery contests, pedestrian ism,
football, handball, sprinkled with commence
ment exercises), railroad subjects, together
with the almost endless record of the day; the
musical and dramatic criticisms, the great
range of correspondence, and so on ad ixitiui
tum. Nothing is said and nothing can be given
of the way this news is obtained, the short time
to prepare long and important articles for the
columns of the paper for the next morning;
nothing lof the reporter as a detective, critic,
judge of evidence or of his discrimination as
to the value of news. â  These things come to
the newspaper man only after prayer â ; and
fastingâ sometimes a great deal of < the lat
tor. sll any young Â man v. with journal
ism in. his eye thinks he could cut any sort
of figure beside other men* who are 'up'
In : these ' several branches, â¢ why : : he â  \ has
probably a better opinion of himself than a
city editor would have after a month's trial.
A reporter's work Is done when It is finished;
in other words, ;it is never done. , To-morrow
will be the same las to-day ; it may be late ' to
night and early in the morning. , His work is
on - public exhibition every ' day. . It is ' com
pared with the work of accomplished journal
ists at every edition of his paper. .When the
reporter writes his paper speaks. â  He is un
known; his personality, is hidden. With all
other work * the laborer j receives the credit.
With a reporter the paper he represents is the
gainer, and of course to a certain extent he is,
too. But the work is the wheel, moving round
and round until the tire comes off, or the hub
weakens or the spokes break or the axle gives
way ; then a new wheel is at band to take its
place. Reporters are gentlemen c of intelli
gence, good: social position, well read, hard
working, inventive, shrewd, of unusual cul
ture, and yet are generally indifferently w%ll
paid. On the monetary side .the I protession is
not attractive. It is not easy to secure em
pioyment without experience ; in the many
duties journalism. entails." . ' â  ;.
FRATERNAL FELLOWSHIP.

ol such visits that the ladies intend to pay to

favorite in the early sixties. Frank S. Bat

song, in which he gave the prominent mem
ber of the castle a good-natured verbal prod ;
Miss Dora Macdougall, who possesses a very
sweet voice, clear as a bell, sang with good ef

â¢â¢Two Little Kittens"; then Charles E. Bailey
sang "Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep"; J.

INSIST ON THE
RATTLER TEST
The Supervisors Will Not
Change Foundation
Specifications.
Choking of Sewers Is Attributed
to the Use of Inferior
Rock.
Children's Hospital Granted one Year's
D.'lay ia the Performance of
Street Work.
The '-Rattler" test for rock used in con
crete foundations of bituminous street
work has again lound favor in the eyes of
the Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors, and ibe wishes of the Ban
Francisco Association of Improvement
Clubs have been set at naught.
The association recently petitioned tho
board to eliminate the test from the speci
fications for stone concrete foundation
for bitumen and the matter was thor
oughly investigated by the committee.
In its report, prepared yesterday, the
committee said that a great many
opinions as to the advisability of using
the test had been sought and that in 'Â«
majority of cases the verdict had been it.
favor of it because of tbe eviis that had
arisen from the use of inferior rock that
would not stand the test.
In this connection attention was called
to the necessity of frequent cleaning of
the sewers, at a large expense to the City,
because of the debris of inferior rock used
on the streets, and ihe case of tue Chan
nel-street sewer is particularly referred to.
The statement is made taat the larger
portion of the material thai; chokes this
outiet is composed of rotten rock from the
contiguous streets and that the same is
true of other cewers about the City.
The committee further argued that
while the present specifications permit
the use of rock to macadamize streets
without the test it would be against
all precedent to permit it to be used in
the composition of concrete under the
pavements unless subjected to the test as
to its hardness and toughness", or in any
work where the present specifications re
quire tbe test.
The report was therefore against the
petition.
Mrs. John T. Merrill, one of the charit
able who assists in maintaining the Chil
dren's Hospital, appeared before tbe com
mittee and asked that the measure or
dering Sacramento street, between Cherry
and Maple paved, be vacated or at least laid
over for a period. She stated that tho ex
pense of the work would fall on the hos
pital and that as it was at present trying
to liquidate other large bills it would em
barrass the institution to a considerable
extent.
The committee agreed to recommend
that the matter be laid over for one year.

damages resulting from his being run down
by a train while driving across Center street
at San Jose, it was stated that Slavich testified
that he was seated in the bottom of the wagon

Political Code of California.
The foregoing section of the Political
Code of California is found on page 475 of
Deering's Codes and Statutes of 1885, and
it bas not been amended or repealed so far
as can be learned, for it ia quoted on page
117 in the second special report of the
Commissioner of Labor at Washington,
D. C, in 1896. In this report it is under
the caption, "Lsbor Laws â California â
Contract Work on Public Buildings Pro
hibited."
The foregoing statute is the basis of a
movement instituted in labor union circles
to nullify several important contracts for
the construction of State buildings in this
City. Not only are the labor unions in
terested in this matter, but several State
officers have taken it up and are making a
carelul investigation to learn if the State
laws have been violated.
The buildings specially referred to are
the Affiliated Colleges and the new ferry
depot. The Rae Building and Construc
tion Company has a contract from the
Board of Regents for the construction of
the colleges, and the Harbor Commission
ers let the contract for the ferry depot to
the San Francisco Bridge Company.
This agitation grew out of tne fact that
the contractors of both hired a lot of non
union men, who are worked more than
the eight hours prescribed by the State
law and who are paid less than the rate
of wages adopted by the labor unions.
This set on foot an inquiry to see if the
law could be used to the advantage of the
interested unions, most of which are
affiliated with the Building Trades' Coun
cil of San Francisco. The council ap
pointed a committee of energetic workers
â W. M. Page, John McCann and J. H.
Jorgensenâ who did not let the gras% grow
under their feet. They first called upon
Labor Commissioner E. L. Fitzgerald, who
looked into the labor laws, in which he
found the foregoing section.
The matter by this *.ime had taken such
a serious turn that he felt the need of
legal advice, and in turn he submitted the
matter-to Attorney-General Fitzgerald.
The latter is looking into the law on
this point and he may give an opinion
most any day. If he findj that the law
quoted has not been repealed or materially
amended the letting of the contracts by
the regents and the Harbor Commission
ers may cause serious complications, for
both contractors are under heavy bonds
and both have performed considerable
work on the two structures.
Not only bas the Building Trades Coun
cil's committee applied to the Labor Com
missioner, and through the latter to the
Attorney-General, but it sent a Jong letter
to Governor Budd upon the subject last
evening. In the letter all the foregoing
facts were set forth, together with several
other features. The letter recited that
the Affiliated Colleges are being built
with the State's money derived by taxa
tion from the property-holders, many of
whom are union men who by their labor
are supporting and rearing families. They
believe that the work upon this building
should therefore be performed by union
men, who shall receive a full day's pay
for their labor, and that the State law
of eight hours a day shall be enforced and
the system of paying by the hour, ten
hours a day, be abolished.
Tne committee requests the privilege of
presenting their views to tne Board of
Regents at its next meeting, and asks that
the Governor uÂ«e bis best efforts to grant
such an audience. Tne matter of the
ferry depot is not so fully gone into, as tho
committed is waiting for the Attorney-
General's opinion.
However, at the meeting of the Council
last evening several interesting statements
were made. One was that the sub-con
tractors who are getting: out the stone
work for the ferry building are doing a
great injury to the working people.
Committeeman Page asserted that the
situation at the quarry at Sites, Colusa
County, is worse than a Mendoc.no
County lumber camp. "Inexperienced
men," he said, "are taken up and worked
for 20 cents an hour ten hours a day. They
are compelled to purchase all of their
supplies from the contracting company's
store at exorbitant prices and are not
even furnished with blankets. None of
the regular union stonecutters will accept
work at the terms and conditions
offered."
The committee asserted that the cause
of the delay on the stone work on the
ferry building is owing to the fact that
the contractors are not hiring competent
stonecutters to get out the rock. This,
the committee asserts, makes the con
tractors responsible on their bonds, pro
viding that the contract is of itself legal,
which is a matter of doubt in theirjminds.
At any rate, between organized labor
and the investigations of the several State
officers the legality of these two big con
tracts will be seriously questioned, and
those who claim to have some knowledge
of State labor laws assert thaÂ« before the
inquiry is over it will be necessary to
nullify both contracts, even at a great
Jo's to the State, and have the work done
by day's labor. This is what the labor
unions want.

AN INJURY TO THE CITY.
The Merchants' Association Dissatis
fied With the Way Pure Food
Laws Are Administered.
The regular meeting of the board of di
rectors of the Merchants' Association was
held to-day. The following applications
for membership were received, and the
parties unanimously elected as regular
members of the association: R. Bujan
noff, 9 Lick place: Commercial Light and
Power Works, 506 Commercial street;
Robert Dross, 16U5 Polk street; J. S. Go
deau, 303 Montgomery avenue; B. Hart,
13 Sansome street; Oregon Coal and Navi
gation Company, 10 Market streei; Orien
tal Gas Engine Works, 105 Beale street;
R. J. Techau & Co., Market street and
City Hall square; John Utscuig, 326 Bush
street, and 1). N. & E. Walters & Co.. 529
Market sueet. This makes the total mem
bership at present 524.
Hugo Kotnschild of the firm of Roths
child & Ehrennfort was unanimously
elected as a director to till the vacancy of
M. A. Rothschild, who contemplates a
lone absence from the City.
It was decided to have a committee of
the board join a committee from the Sixth
street Improvement Club in endeavoring
to have that street provided with batter
railway facilities.
The board decided to hold a conference
within a few days witli the committee of
the Board of Regents upon the Wiltner
ding School site.
A report was received from the commit
tee on the pure food laws stating that tne
committee had endeavored to secure a fair
and reasonable execution of the law gov
erning this subject. The board heartily
approved of the pure food laws, but be
lieves that at present as administered by
the Boara of Health it was doing great
and unnecessary injury to the dealers of
the Ciiy as well as to the City itself. The
board believed that a rea?onnble notice
should be eiven to innocent parties selling
any adulterated or impure food-., so that
the sale of the same can be discontinued.
HUDELSON LIBEL CASE.
Judge Campbell Intimates That
Ec Will Net Hold the
Defendant.
At the Request of the Complaining
Witness the Arguments Are
Postponed.
It was not Judge Campbell's fault that
the criminal libel case of Benjamin X
Hudelson was not finally disposed of last
night. The case has dragged along since
December 7, and the Judge made a des
perate effort to finish it, but the complain
ing witness, Attorney D. B. Woodworth,
obtained a continuance till next Wednes
day night to make his argument.
Tne witnesses examined yesterday after
noon and evening were C. W. Kyle for the
defense and H. T. Marshall and Rev. Don
ald M. Ross in rebuttal.
The Judge then asked if counsel were
ready to proceed with their arguments,
and Woodworth said he wanted to have
time to go through the whole of the evi
dence. Attorney Jordan said he was
ready for the defense, but Woodworth in
sisted upon delay.
"My general impression," said the
Judge, "from the evidence is that I don't
think the case would ever reach a jury on
the ground that the communication wus
privileged, and if it did I don't think a
jury would convict. That's how 1 feel at
present."
Woodworth lost his temper and said
that unless he was granted time to peruse
the evidence be would withdraw from the
case. He attacked the Judge and Attor
ney Jordan and was called to time.
Attorney Jordan moved for a dismissal
and there was another scene, in which
Woodworth referred to Re?. Donald M.
Koss.
"I think," said the Judge, "that Ross
was honest in his intentions, but hb has
been fooled by somebody. Clergymen, as
a rule, don't understand tne tricks ot men.
Jio-s teemed to want to get even with
Uudelson, and in doing so neglected the
Christian spirit of not seeking ;or revenge.
Why were you chasing around with A. P.
A.'s with affidavits in your pockets when
you were not a member of the order?"
Woodworth took the stand in answer to
this question and attempted to throw the
blame upon Ross and was sharply cress
examined by Jordan.
Finally it was decided to hear the argu
ments Wednesday night.
CHARGED WITH MAYHEM.
M. Kahn Arrested on Complaint of
William Young.
M. Kahn was booked at the City Prison
Wednesday on a charge of mayhem. The
complaining witness is William Young,
son of the proprietor of the Russ House.
Kahn and Young were playing a friendly
game of pool in the rooms, 17 Ellis street,
Monday evening. A dispute arose and
Kabn bit Young on the head with a cane.
Young grappled with bini aud Kuhn
seized Young's linger between bis teeth
and proceeded to chow it. Bystanders in
terfered and separated the combatants.
Young fainted from the pain of bis
wounded finger and Kabn fled.
The case was reported to the police and
Kabn was arrested on O'Farrell street.
Death of Wlllia M. O'Brien.
After an illness of only three days, TV ill la M.
O'Brien, senior member of the firm of O'Brien
& Bons, carriage manufacturers, passed away.
On Monday 01 the present week Mr. O'Brien
complained of severe pains in his head and
left the factory for his home. Kvery effort to
relieve proved unavailing, and at 11 o'clock
on Wednesday evening he died.
The funeral services will be held at 9:30
this murnlue from his late residence, 1524
Golden Gate avenue. The remains will be
taken to Holy Cross Church, where a requiem
high mass, commencing at 1 o'clock, will be
celebrated. The remaiAs will be interred in

Katzaxier Wanta a Pardon.
Max Katzauer, one of the old Custom-house
ring, who did a lively business in forging
Chinese certificates, has applied to the Presi
dent for a pardon. He was sentenced by Judge
Morrow to eighteen months' imprisonment,
and his term is nearly expired. His desire for
a pardon is no doubt that iio may regain his
right to vote. The President has referred the
matter to Treasury Agent Moore, who, it is
understood, has sent back an adverse report.
Sale of tbe Winters Ranch.
There was consummated yesterday,

pany had withdrawn all of its offerings of
steins, and would keep them out of the

People on the water front are wonder
ing what has struck the wrecker White
law that she makes such slow progress in
her search for the boiler of the wrecked
steamer Bunol, that fell out of the hull
when the little vessel was in collision
with the bark Olympic
It is a well-known fact that the longer
tbe boiler lies on tbe bed of tbe bay the
less chance there is of recovering it, be
cause of its tendency to sink into the ooze
of the bottom.
The wrecker is under contract by the
day to raise the machinery, so that it
really maKes little difference to her own
ers whether they get the object of their
search or not.
It is not thought possible that the lead
bars which formed a portion of the So

is also searching, will ever be recovered.

Armory Hall, Alameda, Saturday after
noon and evening. The Young People's
Theatrical Association has the entertain
ment in charge, and great preparations
are being made for its success.
The play, "$15,000, or a Lottery Ticket,"
was played in Alameda just a year ago,
and was a great successâ so great, in fact,
that when the young people announced
last month that they would play "To
Let," another farce, Herbert Clarke, the
business manager, was besieged with let
ters asking for another production of
'$15,000." The wiÂ»ueÂ» of their friends
will be gratified and "$15,000" will be re
peated Saturday afternoon and evening.
During the afternoon performance a
silver medal will be given to the most
popular player of the Alameda Alerts.
Every one present will be entitled to vote.
This contest promises to be very close,
and friends of members of that famous
baseball team are working hard for their
favorites. Some of the more progressive
have printed election cards bearing the
names of their choice, and these are being
distributed about the town.
A banner will be presented to the Alerts
at tbe evening performance. The banner
was given by lw J. Van Voorhiaa, and will
be presented by one oi the popular
daughters of Alameda. The lize of the
banner is 24x30 incnes, with yellow silr
background and silver letters.
The inscription on'it will De: "Alameda
Alerts, Champion Amateur Baseball Team
of Pacific Coastâ lÃ96-7."
Captain Hammond of the Alerts will re
ceive the banner and make a speech of
acceptance. Altogether it will be a gala
day for Alameda and her favorite baseball
team.
Tue cast of characters for the farce
will be:

A NOTED VIOLIN VIBTUOSO.
Camilla Uno Arrive* Here After a
leather .Long Absence.
Among: the arrivals at the Occidental
Hotel is M me. CamillafUrso, the celebrated
violin virtuoso, who has come to the coast
to amuse and entertain with the "fiddle
and tbe bow." It is several years since
Mme. UrÃo was last here.
She has had many callers since her ar
rival, among whom were a number of her
old friends. Mme. Urso has a company
with her, and will give her first per
formance on Monday evening at Golden
Gate Hall.
During the series of concerts of Mme.
Urso she will bring, among the novelties,
the Caririccio by Niels Gaae, a posthu
mous work found in his papers and first
brought out in London by Herr Joachim
and in New York by Mme. Urso; a caprice
de concert by Ernest Guiraud; Andante
Cantabile by Seambati; studies by Pasa
nini, Rigaudon, Saint Saens and others.
These different works, with the excep
tion df the Paganini studies, were first
played in America by Mme. Urso, who
also in recent years at the New York
Philharmonic Society introduced to the
American public the concerts of Rubin
stein in G major, the concerts ot Max
Bruch No. 3, the concerts of Lassen, the
concerts of Joachim No. 3. all of which
shows a new departure in violin literature.
Mme. Urso brings with her two magni
ficent violins, a Joseph Guarnerius del
Jesu, made in 1837, for which she has re
fused recently 1200 guineas, and her
famous Lorento Guadaginni, considered
by the connoisseurs the most perfect in
existence.
Among her collection of bows, all made
by the lamous maker Tourte, is one pre
sented m her Dy Herr Joachim, when she
visiteJ Berlin tbnee years ago. Dr. Joa
chim is now using one of Mme. Urso's
bows, a very tine one that was made for
the celebrated violinist Bnillot.
The short series of three concerts to be
given next we -k will be the only ones in
which Mme. Urso will be heard this sea
son.

Massenet's Lurid "Navar
raise" Startles the
Spectators.
Mme. Foedor's Brilliant Work
in the Part of
Anita
"Les Dragons de Villars " Followed
in the Doubb Bill Last
Night
The audience at the California Theater
received a liberal bill last night. They
were first given "Les Dragon de Villars,''
an opera comique in three acts, which is
usually considered enough for an even
ing's entertainment. A lavish manage
ment evidently did not consider it enougn,
so "Les Dragons" was eked out with
Massenet's hour of concentrated agony,
"La Navarraise," which contains enough
excitement to spread over half a dozen of
the older operas.
"La Nayarraise" was certainly inspired
by "La Cavalleria Rusticana," but Mas
senet and Henri Cain resolved to go one
better in the way of sensation than Mas
cagni and his librettists. These French
gentlemen succeeded. There is not a bar
in the work in whicn nervous spectators
are not on tenterhooks of excitement,
and even the most phlegmatic auditors
feel a cold perspiration bespangle their
brows as the lurid story of 'La Navar
raise" unfolds itself.
There was not much applause last night,
but that was not the fault of the music
nor of its interpreters. Massenet lias con
structed his Mascagnesque opera on the
modern lyric drama plan, which is a
stranger to the pezzi staccali that admit of
erjeores. In "La' Navarraiae" everything
follows so consecutively that there is not
breathing space for applause, much less
for encores. At the beginning of the first
tableau the audience, not being educated
up to modern lyric drama, broKe in wiih
some untimely manifestations of pleasure,
but they were quickly quelled and the in
discretion wa* not repeated.
At the end of the end of the second
tableau the principals were recalled re
peatedly.
Mme. Foedor was the only star member
of the company in "La Navarrai?e,"
which was perhaps a concession to the
oft-repeated statement that she owns the
opera whenever she appears in it. She
certainly did brilliant woric as Anita,
though her rendering of the part would
have been more tragic had her low notes
been as powerful and dramatic as her
high tones.
Elward Deo does not sing nearly so
well as either Prevost or Massart, but he
acts much better than either of the lead
ing tenors, and on that account he was
well placed in the role of Araquil, which
would be abused if badly acted. Freiche
was good as the ruthless father, and
Javid made an excellent Garrido.
"Les Dragons de Villars" is a standard
opera comiqne, but last night most of the
people who appeared in it were operetta
singers, and, as might have been ex
pected, the orchestration was too heavy
for them. Freiche, who played Belainy,
the dissipated Marechal dv Cogis, was
quite equal to the reqairementsof his role.
Mme. Savine played the persecuted
Rose, who saves the Pasteur and his
â¢proscrit flock from the gny dragoons, and
very charming she was in the part, par
ticularly in the last act. though nor voice
was not equal to the recitatives.
On April 9 Henri Albers, the popular
barytone, will sing the title role in Am
broise Thamss' "Hamlet" for his own
benefit.
About a Watch.
Charles F. Mullen, a private detective, was
arrested last night on a charge of misde
meanor embezzlement. Some time ago he
bought a watch from E. BujanolT, a jewelry
aeent, on the installment plan and left the
City with it. As soon as he returned Bujanoff
had him arrested.

RENO NOW IS
IN THE SWIM
Reaching Out for a Bit
of Carson's Pugilistic
Fame.
A Committee Is in This City
Looking for Fist c *
Talent.
Bob F tzsimmoDS Will Malta Hors -
shoes or Eat Shrimps Against
Any Kan.
Carson has had its great athletic day
and now Reno, an opposition town in Ne
vada, is looking for a little athletic notor
iety.
There is at present a small committee of
R no's citizens on a visit to this City un
der charge of J. F. Dennis, who !â¢ a prom
inent aitorney of Reno.
Mr. Dennis is looking for atheltic talent
and incidentally learning a thing or two
about pugilism and how to conduct pugil
istic entertainment*.
In conversaiion with a prominent mem
ber of .the Olympic Club Mr. Dennis said
that Reno has a structure within which any
kind of sport can be held and that the
residents are determined to be as deep in
the swim for sport this summer as are the
j conic of any other city in the State of
Nevada.
The building which Mr. Dennis referred
to is the old penitentiary which was never
completed and which is situated about a
mile from the town of Reno. During
Governor Bradley's (Old Broadhorn) ad
ministration, and that was in the seventies,
the appropriation lor the completion of
the building became exhausted and
nothing has been done since that time by
the State in ti.e way of appropriating
money to complete the prison. The mas
sive stone walls still stand in place aud
the promoters of fistic sports are of the
opinion ttiat with some few improve
ments the discarded old structure can be
converted into a first-class amphitheater
where all kinds of sports can be held.
Tne people of Reno argue that durine
the summer months the climate is so fine
that many people who will visit the moun
tain town lor tne purpose of witnessing a
carnival of sport will remain over for a
few weeks to enjoy the beautiful moun
tain scenery and breathe the fresh and
crisp air oi the lnnh altitude.
Fighting will not be the only sport the
Renoites intend to carry off this summer.
Handsome inducements will be offered,
it is said, for a meeting of tiie champion
wrestlers of the worid, and the styles of
â¢wrestling will be catch-aa-catch-can,
Graeco-RomaD. Cornish and collar-aiid
elbow.
"; "Parson" Davies is seemingly very
anxious that a champion heavy-weight
shall be lound amont; the aspirants for
high fistic honor*, now that Fiizsimmons
has announced his ultimatum to retire.
The "Parson" has a scheme which he
thin*-; is just the rieht thing, and which
he say- is bound to bring out a champion..
He said yesterday that all of the lighters â
those of them who really want to fightâ or
th- lr backers should make up a pool, and
thai each man deposit in the keeping of
come responsible person the sum of $2500,
th* winner to take ail, including the
purse.
In all probability. the names of such
famous scrappers as Peter Maber, Joe
Choynski, Joe Goddard, Denver Smith,
Jim Corbett and Charley Mitchell may
figure on the list of entrants for the cham
pionship race.
Bob Faz-inimons, the champion pugi
list, has been turning out horseshoes for
his many friends since his arrival, and it
i- hardly necessary to state that the shoes
are in great demand.
The champion said yesterday that al
though he had retired from the ring he is
ready to try his hand at another game,
and that is making horseshoes.
"I had quite a number of contests in
Australia while working at my trade,"
baid the champion, "and I always came
out best man. Now, if you think mere is
a horseshoer in this country who can beat
me turning out fancy shoes just dig him
up and I will go him a match for money
or marbles. I am just aa confident oi
winning a horseshoeing match aa I was of
winning thechampionsuip contest."
An attentive listener suggested to Fitz
that he al-o issue a challenge to shrimp
eaters, and the big iellow smiled as he
paid: "That goes too. I guess I can whip
any fellow at that game also. I ate $1
worth of shrimps to-day and I think I'll
have another go at them before I go to
bed. I never eet tired of eating shrimps,
but I don't like this thing of picking off
the crusts."
The champion is seemingly very anr
iona to enter a contest where the making
of horseshoes will be the feature.
WASHINGTON BEEF TRUST.
Cattlemen Force Up the Pries and Butch
ers Are Sending Large Orders
to California.
TACOMA, Wash., March 25.â Ten days
ago the cattlemen of Eastern Washington
announced that the price of beel would go
up from 3% cents to 4 cents. This in a
raise of 75 per cent on the prices of last
fall. The Pacific Meat Company, the
largest meat tirm here, declined to submit
to the combine and sent an order to
Montague, Cal., for fifteen carloads of
cattle, which arrived to-day in good con
dition. This is the first shipment of Cali
fornia cattle into the State in three years.
When the combine of cattlemen wns
formed last fall beef was selling wholesale
at 2\Â£ cento. T.e combine forced the
price up to '6%, forcing the retail price of
Deef up considerably. Frve <fe Bruhn, the
other large wholesale meat firm here, had
some cattle on hand when the price went
up, bur as soon as these are usÂ»d they will
a;so buy California cattle. The Pacific
Meat Comr.any declares that it will break
the back of the Eastern Washington com
bine, so California cattlemen may look
out for some large oruers from the north.

OLYMPIANS STIRRED UP.
Washington's Governor Vetoes a Bill That
Never Passedâ Minute Clerk Charged
â  With Forgery.
OLYMFIA, â Wash., .March 25.â 1 a veto
ing the bill for the construction of a Slate
Capitol last week Governor Rogers alleged
a* one of his principal reasons that the
bill, as amended, failed to receive the
votes of a constitutional majority of House
members, and that at the bottom of the
rollcall,*.- snowing the vote, the reading
clerk at the time made an entry reading:
"The bill has therefore failed to pass."
The day after Governor Rogers exam
ined 1 the records pertaining to the bill at
the Capitol Speaker of the House Cline
and Minute Cleric Pace called and asked
to see the same records and the quoted
entry on the tally sheet. It is claimed
that in the presence ol Chief Clerk Carusi
and others they declared the entry to have
no business there. Chief Clerk Carusi
and Docket Clerk rinbbard made a writ
ten statement 10 the following effect:
"Thereupon Mr. Page took a Knife and
cut from the official and final tally-sheet
entry, 'The bill has therefore failed to
DBBB.' -Mr. Cline held tne Diece while Mr.
Page cut it off. What became of it after
ward we do not know."
To-day Clerks Hubbard and Carusi
swore to complaints before Justice Atkins
rhcr ing Page with forgery in mutilating
the record of the Capitol Dill. A warrant
has been issued, and will be served to
morrow. Tneir statement implicated
Speaker Cline as deeply as Pago, and he
will be requested to return here from his
home at New Whatcom. This city is
greatly stirred up over the trouble, which
results from the bitter local feeling over
the Governor's veto.
Friends of the Capitol bill contend that
the entry about the bill not passing is
a false one. and are investigating to as
certain how it came to be made. Cline
and Page favored the bill, while Hub
bard and Carusi: support the Governor's
veto. There is reason to believe the row
over the passage or non-passage of the
bill is just be.' inning, though the veto
cannot be set aside, or the Governor per
suaded that the. bill actually passed.

NEW MEXICO'S ASSASSINS.
The President's Respi c of the Borreqos
Is Criticizedâ Explanation of Arch
bishop Chappelle.
SANTA FE, N. Mcx , March 25.âPresi
dent McKinley's respite of the Borrego
assassins continues to be the all-absorbing
topic here. Friends of tee condemned
men have in circulation more than a
dozen petitions praying for a commuta
tion of the death sentence, which will be
executed on April 2, unless clemency is
granted them. Upholders of Jaw and
order are also circulating protests against
further interference with the decisions of
the courts. The latter ate being numer
ously signed throughout the Territory.
Should President McKinley again in
terfere, it is >aid, an appeal will be made
to Congress, and it is not improbable that
a resolution of inquiry will follolw into
the authority of the President io assume
jurisdiction in the premises.
Washington dispatches have credited
Archbishop Chappelle with having been
instrumental in securing the first respite
for the condemned men from Mr. Cleve
land, with the result that the Archbishop
has been severely criticized in official and
church circles throuehout the Territory.
The reverend centleman stated to-day
that friends of the prisoners had used bis
name in their appeals to the President in
securing the respite. To-day Dr. Chap
pelle said:
"I had absolutely nothing to do with
the last respite granted ihese men. I was
telegraphed by Mr. Catron and others
from Wasnington and asked to send a
telegram to Attorney-Genpral McKnnna
urging a ten days' respite, but I answered
I had done all I could in conscience do. My
actions in the Borrego matter arÂ« just
this: I asked Gov. Thornton, not in jus
tice, but in mercy, to commute the sen
tence of at least two of the accessories â
Valencia and Aiarid. I made the same
request of President Cleveland and again
of President McKinley. 1 hope you will
set me right in mis matter."
SAN DIEGO SOCIETY STIRRED.
Divorce Suit With Two Highly Raspoc ed
Principals â Friends Working lor
a Reconciliation.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 25â Society
in this city is all agog over the suit lor
divorce filed yesterday by Mrs. Elizabeth
B. Couts against her husband, Cave J.
Couts. Both have been highly respected
residents of this county for many years
and leaders in society circles. Mr. Couts
owns tbs famous Ranchita mine at Ban
ner and is wealthy. Mrs. Couts recently
inherited $50,000 from her father, the late
J. W. Clemens. The complaint alleged
infidelity and while it named no one as
co-respondent it stated that certain in
criminating letters had been found in
Mr. CouVs pockets. For weeks past Mrs.
Couts has been generally sunpnsed to be
in S. Louis visiting relative"), but yester
day she was seen in this city with their
only child, a boy o: 8 fears, of whom both
parents are passionately fond and the
custody of whom the mother prays for in
her complaint.
To-day friends of both parties have been
trying to bring about a reconciliation,
with some show of success. This is done
not only for the parties themselves, but
also for the sake of the reputation of a
handsome youn:: girl of good family in
this city who is currently reported to have
been very indiscreet and to be at the
bottom of the trouble. Hence the true
friends of all are very desirous of keeping
the cas* out of court. This morning Mr.
Couts went to Los Angeles to consult his
attorney, and it is oelieved the matter
may be settled in a few daya.

TESTING THE
FEDERAL SITE
Government Engineers Are

and Mission.
An Attempt to Learn the Condi
tion of the Soil Below
Ground.
Gr at Piles Are Biing Driven Into the
Earlh to a Depth of Seventy
Feet.
To those who are watchful of public
matters there hare lately been encourag
ing signs at the Postoffice site. Seventh
and Mission streets. The Government en
gineers, acting under directions of the
Treasury Department, nave begun a series
of tests at the Posioffice lot. In spite of
many previous tests the Treasury Depart
ing t has concluded to make further ex
aminations before going forward with the
Federal Employes Driving Piles in the Postoffice Site.
great work of building a Posloffice for
Ban Franci-co.
The wgik now undor way is in charge
of Engineer B. Hunt, asoistant to Engi
neer L. B. Davis, C. E., of the Government
Corps, while T. C. Marker is in charge for
Collector Wise, custodian of the building.
The purpose of the test is to settle the
question whether it will be necessary to
drive piles all over the foundation part of
ot tho lot as a sub-foundation for the.
Federal building, a custom which is usual
whe never there is doubt as to the solidity
of the earth upon which edifices of this
character are to be constructed.
Four pits nave b?en dug to a depth of
about 20 feet, and into these piles are
beinjr driven for test purposes. The piles
are 70 feet long, and they are being driven
into the ground tneir fall length. The
pile-driver now being used weighs a ton,
and the investigation bo far shows that
there are strong evidence^ that the ground
is tirm enou.h for the purposes in view.
Two piles were driven down their full
length. The first 40 feet proved to be hard
work, but through tho next 30 feet the
great wooden poles went with more ease.
If the entire test ia as suece^ful as it
now Â«eem- it will doubtless result n a
favorable renort by the Government
engineers and early work by the Govern
ment. It will require about two weeks to
complete the work now under way, which
is wholly in charge of the Treasury and
supplemental to the investigations pre
viously made by Government engineers.
During the progress of the work yester
day it was notice ! that the soil lor the
lirst forty or fifty feet is very hard, the
blows of t! c pile-driver having almost no
effect. One of the piles was broken dur
ing the test, showing that the resistance
of the soil is very great. If the tests con
tinue there is little doubt that the reports
will bi favorable and work on the main
building will soon begin.

MARTIN JULIAN
SAYS HE DIDN'T
; Never Thought San Fran
cisco Was a Jay
Town.
! His Remarks Were Personal,
and in No Way
General.
F;'z?immons' Manager Is Wrotb,
and Threatens to Make
Some Exposures-
Martin Julian says he didn't say it.
The handsome young manager of cham
pion of all champions. Bob Fitzsiramons,
was in high dudgeon all day yesterday
over the appearance of an article in the
monarch of the fakers, in which he was
pictured as emulating Lillian Russell,
William H. Crane and other people who
have given alieged expert opinions to the
effect that Frisco is a "jay" town ana
that her people are "sucKers" and "stiff*."
Martin says there is not a word of it true.
"Why I never saw such a fake before,"
he declared. "1 have heard of good ones,
and could tell of a few this same paper in
dulged in at Carson, but this last one beats
them all hollow. It is simply a petty
effort to get baclc at me because I took
occasion yesterday to tell one of the Ex
aminer crew what I thought of him and
tne whole outfit on that sheet.
"This chap and others of the staff hon
eyed around me and pretended to be
friendly toward Fitzsiramons and my
self. Then they turned around at the
first opportunity and attempted to throw
me overboard. It was for this I took one
of them to task. I used rather strong
language, too.
"I called him among other things a 'jay'
a 'fat-head,' and also said the paper he
represented was a 'sucker.' Not once dur
ing my tirade did I refer disrespectfully
or at all to the people of San .Francisco,
nor did I say anything about the town.
Everything I^aid was directed to ami re
lerred solely to the man I was addressing
and to his employers.
"W' y fhould I say anything against
the people here? They have always
treated me kindly and even generously.
S.i ii Francisco is my old home and I lore
the place. But what did these Examiner
people doT Instead of taking my roast to
themselves they resort to falsehood and
trickery and try to make me appear in an
unenviable lit lit before the people. It's
not right and I propose to resent it.
"This is not my first experience with
this crowd," said Julian in conclusion.
"I am satisfied that they stood in on the
job by which Fitz and I were knocked out
of th" fIOOOO which belonged to us after
the fi lit with Sharkey.
"I aye been holding something up my
sleev in regard to that proposition, and
when I spring it somebody is going to get
hurt. I have, among other things, a
statement from J. J. Groom, in which he
confe3-es that Wyatt Earp was demanded
by the Examiner for referee of that con
testâ demanded, mind you."
MARSHALL THE CHAMPION.
Won the American Handicap Pigeon Shoot
at Long Branch â Bad Luck of
Carver and Keogle.
LONG BRANCH, N. J., March 25.â
Thomas A. Marshall of Keitbsburg, 111.,
was the winner of the grand American
handicap, which was decided at Elkwood
Park tbis morning. Maraball made a
clean score of twenty-five birds. His
snare of the prize money is $500. This is
insignificant, however, compared to the
honor of winning ihe greatest rhooting
match in the history of the sport.
Dr. W. F. Carver of Chica-ro and Henry
Keogle of Newark, who shoots under the
name of "Henry Zee, " had a good show
of tieing Marshall. They killed as many
birds, but in each case on* fell dead out
of bounds.
When the marksmen left the traps at 6
o'clock last night twenty-one rounds of
the grand American handicap had been
shot. Marshall, Carver and Keoele were
tied with a straight score. There were
fifteen men who had twenty killed and
twelve who bad erassed nineteen out of
their twenty-one.
The continuation of the match com
menced at 10:30 o'ciocic this morning. At
that time the tmn wÂ»s shining brightly,
but a gale from the west was sweepine
over tne ground. Tlie sDortsmen knew
what this meant. The birds were a fast
lot, and with the help of the wind every
one agreed that it would be difficult to kifl
them. The first to face the traps was W.
L. Dunnell, whose score was 19 out of 2L
Three birds went down before his snre
aim. When Dr. Carver faced the No. 1
trap be was cheered to the echo. An easy
birJ was bis prey. He picked a harder
one on the second trap, and this also was
riddled with lend. On the No. 3 trap,
while shooting his twenty-fourth round,
he had a lowering incomer. The first
barrel iiit the bird square enough, bat to
make sure of his kill the doctor sent an
other load after the pigeon. The high
wind carried the dead bird out of bounds
and In its fall it crashed through on* of
the west windows of the clubhoU3e. The
doctor wag chagrined, but his friends con
soled him by saying that he still had a
! chance of winning. , . .
Keogle brought down both of his birds
in the first and second traps. He went to
the third trap, drew a swift incomer and
filled it with shot. The bird, however,
fell dead out of bounds.
This le.t only Marshall with straight
kills. His first bird was a left quarterer.
One barrel wao enough to dispose of it,
and the Westerner was the winner of the
grand American handicap.
The n:ne men who were second with
twenty-four kills, were Carver, Vun Dyke,
Dr. Williamson, Keogle, Burkbardt,
Voris, Cubberiy, Arno and Appiegate.
They divided $1696 15.
* The thii'i men with twenty-three kills
were W. D -nnell. E. D. Alkire, C. W
Budd, Cornelius Ferguson. "Arkan-aw
Traveler" J. O. R. Dick -y and W. S. King.
These men divided $1091.
To see who were Â»>tr.itled to fourth
money, or the consolation pnzs, each con
testant in the haudicap, with the excep
tion of those wlio had received first, sec
ond and third moneys, were allowed to
enter. It was miss and out. A ter a
number of rounds nad teen shot the fol
lowinp divided fourth money: Grimm,
Hamilton, Powers, McCassin, Thurman,
Purmalo, Piaster, Moore, Guthrie, C. yon
Lengerke, Keyharg, Colonel l>reu and
Colonel Anthony.
Mr. Marshall, the winner of the grand
American handicap, was born in Ken
tucky in 1857. He commenced to shoot at
an early age and is now considered one of
the best shuts in the West. He has been
Mayor of Ksithsburg. 111.-, for twelve
years and served in the Leeislature from
the Thirty-sixth and Thirty-fifth districts
in 1889 and 1891.

Recreation a Very Smart SDrt of a
Filly-Tu'are Took the Opening
Event for A. B. Sprc ckels.
SÂ»ix very ordinary events were decided
at Inelesiae track yesterday before a good
sized attendance of racegoers. Upsets
were not frequent, rim choices capturing
four of the purses offered.
Plunger Ed Purser's big gelding,
â Buckwa, continues to make hay while the
sun. shines. Starting a 3 to 10 chance in
the rinal race oi the day, he encountered
Pat Dunne's Preston as the next best and
"Fitzsimmonized" him in one short
round. â  The orown horse made a try in
the stretch, but Willie Martin saw he was
beaten, and contented himself with finish
iDÂ£ an eased up second.
The opening mile run resulted in
Tulare, -Treachery anJ Satyr finishing
jjneads apart on the wire in the order
Wnsmed. â¢ Altivo led the biÂ« bunch of
|J fourteen to the stretch, where she quit,
' giving up the lead to Tulare, which was
not headed thereafter. Coupled with
Treachery,' the winner opened at 3 to 2,
cltfs:ng equal favorite with Coppy.
Recreation, the Morello filly' winch ran
such a good race first time out, on March
23, proved an easy winner in the four
furlong dash for two-year-olds. She went
to the post second choice to Salmero, and
after LiUie I G had led to a furlong from
from the wire came on and won hands
down in 49^' sec.
The hot tip, imp. Trance, in the mile
run that followed, finished second. The
Australian mare was heavily Ducked at 4
to 1, and afier palloping in front until
witiiin a furlong irom the stand, began to
droop and was defeated rather cleverly by
the 6 too favorite, St. Distaff, rHden by
"Skeets"' Martin. Vincitor, the second
choice, was third.
Tbe Victory of the 7 to 1 outsider. Ho
henzollern, in the fourth event, at seven
furlongs, waÂ« undoubtedly a fluk=". He
was away sailing to a badly jumbled up
start, and won at the end by iiaif a length
from Greyhurst. astride which Thorp was
compelled to pull up at the start, and
then skimming through his field was only
beaten in a drive. Gooa Times, heavily
played from 3 to 2 down to 11 to 10, was
also away badly, nut whs not up to his
best form at that.
Scratching among the entries in the
mile selling affair that came next re
duced the field to seven starters. Double
Quick carried all the coin at odds of 6 to 6,
and waiting on Miss Ruth and vYyoming
in tbe stretch, took the lead at bis pleas

YACHTSMEN IN ACTION.
Scrubbing and Painting Is the Order
of the Day at the Various
Rendezvous.
Sandpaper, paint and pummice are be
ing used in liberal doses over at Tiburon
just now, and in fact at all of the other
yacht rendezvous scattered about the bay.
The Pinta is tbe first of the Corinthian
fleet to get into shape for the new season,
and her crew will celebrate her return to
commission by taking a cruise Saturday
nicht to Greenbrae and return Sunday
nicht. Tbe Harpoon, Arcturus, Secret
and others, which left the TiDurou lagoon
recently, are now swinging lazily at their
moorings, but from within them issue
sounds of hammers, saws and scrapers, in
dicating that renovation is the order of
the day. Over at Stone's ways lie the
Clara, "Commodore "Voune's yecht, Vice-
Commodore Westerield's JEjius and Com
modore Billings' iS'ixie. Tiie latter belongs
to the San Francisco Club's fleet. All ar<s
underline a complete overhauling, aud
will not be relaunched until at the earliest
a week before the season opens. The
Minion and Elia and the yawi Nereid are
also In the hands oi the renovators.
Tom Williams' new yacht is 139t reach
ing completion at Stone's, the iast cjat of
paint and lnienor furniture being all that
remains to De done.
The yachts Belle and Cornelia have
changed hands, and neither will sail
under the Corinthian colors this year.
But their loss will be partially offset by
the return of the old Thetis to the fleet.
The lntter has recently been with the En
cinals and Californias, and now that she
is coming back to 'her first love the Co
rinthians are preparing for her a rousing
welcome.
The Freda will be in new hands this
season, but will still be a Corinthian.
She has been leased from Captain Lyons
by Jack and Joe O'Brien, Fmnk Thorn
ton, Eddie Augelo and Judtfe Cavanaugh.
The Speedwell and Seven Bells are on
the ways at Hunters Point and their own
ers expect to j-ee them back in the water
within a fortnight.
The member^ of the San Francisco
Yacht Club have recovered from their
despondency over tbe recent loss of their
clubhouse and are now actively at work
devising ways and means for the con
struction of a new and even grander
structure on {.he old site. They are meet
ing with considerable encoura^emeni, as
the subscription-list is being rapidly filled.
TO CARRY BICYCLES.
Hayes-Street Cars to Be I- quipped With
Holders by Sunday.
In view of the successful operation of
the bicycle-holders it placed on the cars
of the Sacramento-street line on February
7, the Market-street Railway Company
will fit up all the car 3of the Hayes-street
line in the same manner. It is expected
to have these cars equipped for use on
Sunday. This line was chosen because it
passes the Veiodiome. Eventually, if the
demand justifies, tbe cars of all the lines
of this company will be so equipped.

Some Humorous Laps Between
a Pigeon-Shoiter and a
Jockey.
Becker Scores Anoth?r World's Indoor
Track Record in tbe Mile
Competition.
With tbe exception of tbe five-mile club
cup race (amateur) it was all professional
racing at the Mechanics' Pavilion indoor
cycle tournament last night and the audi
ence ffas treated to some excellent sport.
Some of the crack amateurs can put up
almost as good a race as the professionals,
but the public does Dot care to see the
long preliminary heats contested by a lot
of beginners. The innovation of pro
moting only professional events was
therefore the more appreciated.
Allan Jones, one of the crack local
professionals, showed to advantage in the
quarter-mile dash, winning his heat, semi
final and the tinal with apparent ease,
though he had some hard fields to beat.
One of the features of the evening was a
match race between P. L. Murphy of
Philadelphia, the champion pigeon shot
of tho world, and Cash Sloan, the celebrated
jockey. Considerable money changed
hands on this event among a large num
ber of jockeys and bookmaKers who were
in tbe audience. The race was very fanny,
and the pace so slow that the band played
a funeral march. Murphy had the best of
the eveut, being accustomed to the track,
a fact which his competitor had not
counted upon. It seems that the race had
been arranged several nights previous, and
Murphy took the intervening time to train
on the track afternoons. The time for the
mile was 3:03 2-5.
The quariei-mile dash, professional,
furnished some short, exciting sport and
was the opening event of the evening. It
was run in six preliminary heats, three
semi-finals and a liijai.
Those who qualified for the semi-finals
were: Jones, Morris, Stevens, Allen,
S.arbuck, Boyden, Becker, Bovoe, Harry
Merrill, Slater, Downine and Byrne.
Jones, Steven?, Allen and Morris rode
in the first semi-final. The releree an
nounced to the mm that the winners of
semi-finals and the second in the fastest
heat would qualiiy for the final, so the
riders hud good reason to ride their best.
Jones not the pole, Stevens drooped in
behind him and the others were lighting
from behind. Jones was unbeatable,
though Stevens was close upon h<in al the
tape. The time was 31 1-5 seconds.
Becker won the second, keeping to the
front ell the wny. Boyden and Bovee
fought for second place honors, the
former winning, but as the time was
slower than the first heat, he was shut out
of the final.
In tbe third were Harry Terrill, Down
ing, Byrne and Slater. Terrill got the
worst "of a bnd start and never showed
prominently in the running. Downing
assumed the pace and ied the others to
the tape m S2 seconds, Slater getting
second. This brought Jones Stevens,
BÂ»r ker and Downing into the final.
Jones got the pole at the pistol shot,
Downing second. Be cker and Stevens fol
lowing, and the order was never varied to
the tape, though the hind men tried u*td
to overtake the leader. The time was 33
seconds.
The preliminary heats of the mile-record
race, professional, lurnisiiecl some inter
esting sport In the ttrst heat a surprise
came when McFarland was shut out,
Harry Terrill and Byrne beatinir him.
Weils had the second heat well in hand
when he fell on the last lap, owing to his
saddle coming loose, and threw Slater.
Eaton escaped the mix-up and rode m a
winner. Slater and Wells jumped to their
feet and started to run for the tape, drag
ging their wneels after them. Slater had
a start of We!ls and got there first. Stevens
won the third niceiy, and "Bob" Terrill
and Starbuck ran a dead heat for second
place. Becker won the next as he pleased,
from Dow and Davis. In the lifth Foster
cut in on the insi<ie on the last turn and
rode into a place, but was disqualified for
the act. Downing got first, Morris second.
Byrne, Eaton and Harry Terrill rode
the first semi-final. The finishing sp.-in;
was between Eaton and Tenill, Eaton
winning. In the second were Starbuck,
Davis, Stevens and Becker. Stevens and
Bsoker qualified. Starbuck had a narrow
e-cape Irora a fall, and was thrown out ol
his stride, by brushing against Becker.
Downing, "Bob" Torrill and Morris rode
in tiie third. Downing made an early
sprint, but Terrill came fasi and passed
him, and so did AlorrK
Th:s brought into the final Eaton,
Stevens/ Becker and "Bob" Terrill. The
final was pac?d by Sullivan and Morris on
single Wheels. Sullivan set a hot pace
from the start, and when ai orris swung
in he made* it even faster. The half was
ridden in 1:05. Becker went to the front
on the sixth Jap, and won nil the way,
Stevens running second, Terrill third.
The time was 2:05.
Becker's time is a world's indoor record
for a professional mile in competition.
The live-mile club cup race was contested
by J. E. Wing for the Olympic Club
Wheelmen ana H. W. Squires for the
Acme Club Wheelmen, paced by Gooch
and Elford of the Reliance Club on a
tandem. They rode the first njile in
2:21 3-5, two miles in 4:33 3-5, three miles
6:45 4-5 and four miles in 8:57 4-5. which
was 2-5 of a second faster than Kenna's
time of the previous night. The tandem
dropped out early in the fifth mile, leaving
Wing and Squires to fight It out. Wing
had the lead and kept it to the finish,
Equires trylnsr desperately but unsuccess
fully to pass him. The time for the five
miles was 11:05 4-5, a new world's record,
as it lowers the record made by Kenna
Wednesday night by 11 1-5 seconds.

retary of War.
From the following copy of a latter re

small-arm practice in the future:

FRANK HOLBROOK
AGAIN TRIUMPHS
Will Be Secretary of a
New Society at the
Old Stand.
Secretary Welsh Changes His
Quarters by Order of the
Directors.
Tbe Nature cf the Charges Made
Against Welch Under Oath
Are Startling.
"California Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children. C. P. Welch, sec
retary."
Thai was the inscription that for many
moons has shone on tiie glass door of one
of the rooms on the fiftn floor of the Dono
hoe building. It was the guiding star of
people with tale 3of woe, domestic infe
licity and complaints in general without
n amber.
But now there is a change. Secretary
Welch, a sponge and a bottle of ammonia
did the trick. During the process of re
moving the inscription Mr. Welcn found
it necessary to adjourn several times and
breathe a few deep draughts of air not
laden wiih the potent fumes of the strong
alkaii.
The reason for this proceeding is that
he society will remove at once to new
headquarters in the Union-square build
ing, 211 Powell street, rooms 8 and 9,
which will be open for business next Mon
day.
When asked bis reasons for the change
in location the secretary remarked sen
ten tiously that he had been ordered to do
so by the directors; that that wes all he
knew and ail he cared about. The truth
of the matter is that it wns not considered
wife to remain any longer in such close
proximity to the Animal Society, as the
two have jarred on each other's feelings
for some time.
Bui the rooms Secretary Welch left will
not remain bare, and the walis "will not
stare with a cold, cruel gaze" at him who
comes for assistance in case 3of cruelty.
Not at all. Mr-. John Pettee has solemnly
averred by her hiuie sable cape that there
fchall be a new society to take the place of
tbe old, and in such matters Mrs. John
Pettee is an expert.
The new organization will be knnwn as
the San Francisco Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children. Arrange
ments to place it in working order will be
completed at a rneetin gto b> held next
Monday. Mrs. Peace's coadjutors in this
matter are Mrs. Greenwood and Mrs. Mo
Kin ley.
Frank Holbrook, recognized as one of
tbe moat capable officials who nave ever
had charge of the society, has been se- j
lected as the secretary of the new body, |
and wiil begin the performance of his olii- j
ciai duties on April 1. It is stated by all
that the loss of Mr. HolbrooK to the old
organization will be keenly lelt a3 the
weeks roll by.
The board oi directors took absolutely
no notice of the charges filed by Charles
Holbrook against Secretary Welch, al
though they were supported by the affida
vits of about twenty responsible persons.
They iuclude charges of di3coiirtesy, vio
ience, insulting language, violation of
duty and many other specific charges.
Among those making the charges are
the following:
Matthew MiCurrie, 3365 Twenty-second
street; Mrs. Charles Driver, 245 Minna
street; Mrs. John Pettee, 2505 Leaven
worth; George F. Mahne, 2544 McAllister;
Sister Julia of the Sheltering Arms; Mrs.
Sarah Crotlv, 2515 Foisom; C. B. Hol
brook. 321 Clipper; Mrs. Mary Mooiiey,
183 Tehnma; Gus Clarson, 2505 Leaven
worth; George L. Dehner, 12b Moss; Mrs.
Bessie Olseh, 1031 C:ay; Edward McCnr
rie, 704 Powell; Attorney James H. Long,
and Mrs. Julia Moffitt, 3 Rincon court.
These persons, considering tne nature
of their cnarge--, think it astonishing that
tbe directors did not even see fit to in
vestigate them. Welch is accused oi not
only calling women names unfit for puo
lication, btit of telling one who applied for
assistance to go and wash herself before
asking aid, and of entering a private house
and searching in bureau drawers for prop
erty he claimed had been stolen. These
charges are made under oath.
JUSTICE CARROLL ANGRY.
He Characterizes AXisa Josephine Gib
bons' Statements as Falsehoods.
Justice of ibe Peace Carroll is exceed
ingly angry over the notoriety info which
he has come through the charges tiled
against him with the Grand Jury by Miss
Josephine Gibbons. So accuses him of
retaining possession of a mandolin in
trusted to him pending certain litigation
over its purchase price. This is what tdÂ«
Justice has to say about the matter:
"That woman's story is a falsehood and
I shall make it warm (or her. These are
the real facts of trie case: The action
brought by her teacher was heard by me,
and I dismissed it upon the ground that
the plaintiff had brought the wrong kind
of action. Her attorney never entered the
judgment, but that was not my fault. It
'a not tne province of a Jus-ice of the
Peace to enter judgments, the attorney
does tnst ami the Judge signs them.
"Well, the plaintiff's attorney brought
another action, in replevin, and ttm time
Judge Cook heard the case. I Had nettl
ing whatever to do with it. As to her
not being notified, or not being tried
sooner, that was her own fault, She skips
around from house to house, and the offi
cers could not find her to serve the papers.
She cou.dn't be located, so what could
tueydo?
"Sbe was atraid she'd lose that case.
Why, she daren't even take the stand in
her own behalf when the case was tried
before me. And, Deing afraid she'd lose,
she deposited the mandolin with me,
pending the determination of her case.
And now, because she's Jost, she goes to
tne Grand Jury and trumps up charges
against me."
TIM CRAIG'S RANCH.
Judge Morrow Decide* an Ejectment
Suit on Monterey < ropeiry.
For several days past Judge Morrow,
sitting as magistrate ol the United States
Circuit Court, has bad before him the case
of Â£. S. B. Cowell of Colorado against
Timothy Craig and wife of Monterey
County. Toe action was to eject Craig
from property known as Tim Craig's farm.
Years ago Craig wanted to borrow from
Henry Cowell, father of the complainant,
$5000 and give a mortgage on the prop
erty as security. Ho got the mosiey. but
gave Â«i deed 10 the property with the un
derstnruiing that he could redeem the
property at the expiration of three years
by paying the principal and interest.
Coweil refused to accept ilie money at the
CASTORIA
For Infants and. Children.
Hall!' y<2r sftTsj s? "* ft Â«
expiration of tbe term stated, and the
Craig's have lived there ever since. The
property was deeded, by the- father to the
son, who at last brought action for eject
ment. The Craigs claim that, tbe deed
was given to answer the purpo-e of a
mortgage and that they have Deen ready
to pay back the money. Judge Morrow
yesterday decided that the deed will have
to stand lor its face showing. Alter re
ceiving this favorable verdict Cowell of
fered to seil the laud back to Craig for
$7500.
HANGED HIMSELF.
John Kosa, a Patient at the City and
County Hospital, Commits Sui
cide.
John Rosa, an inmate of the City and
County Hospital, committed suicide by
haueing himself early yesterday morning.
He had procured a piece of balerope.
which he tied to a sash around his waist.
He wound one end of the sash around his
neck and attached the other end of the
rops to one of the rungs oi the balus
trade. He then swung himself into space.
John Dillon, an employe of the hospital,
while making his rounds yesterday morn
ing found the dead body banginz from
the rope. The night watchman saw and
heard nothing.
Rosa was 67 years of ape and entered the
hospital on February 26. His lungs were
badly diseased and he knew that bis case
was hopeless, which evidently preyed
upon his mind and led io the rash act.
He was a native of France and at one
time resided in Contra Costa County.
FITZ SETTLED THE BILL
Jimmy Carroll Finally Got a
Portion of the Money
Due H m.
The Cornishman Would Have Been
Arrested Hed H? Tried to
Leave the State.
Bob Fiizsimnions has settled his long
standing financial difference with Jimmy
Carroll, tho lightweight, and has freed
himself from the danger of arrest.
Carroll was determined that if the bill,
which airounted to $967, was noi paid be
fore Bob left for the East, be would swear
out a warrant charging Bob with attempt
ing to leave the State to defraud bis cred
itor?.
The lanky one was in Justice Carroll's
court yesterday to answer aa order of ex
amination, flanked on one side by Mrs.
Filzsimmona and on the other by Martin
Julian. An attorney Jed his forces.
Bob wore a black Prince Albert, a shin
ing tile and a pair of bright yellow snoes.
The holder of Carroll's claimâ J. J.
Raverâ wanted to go on with the exami
nation, but something evidently troubled
Ju tan, and he soon began to talk of com
uromiae. A settlement was on the tapis
for some little time, but the Julian offer
wan too small, and the negotiations wen>
broken off.
Fitzs manager wanted to settle by pay
ing Carroll $300 and remunerating Raver
for his trouble, but the Cornishman's ex
fiiend demanded $400 for his judgment,
and the case was continued until 3 o'clock
this afternoon to try to bring the parties
to terms.
Fitz chewed gum industriously, and
darted his little blue eyes sharply about
the room while the wrangling of the legal
lignts was going on, but be seemed to take
little interest in the proceedings.
Late last evening the representatives of
Carroll and Fitzsimmons got together and
seitled the matter by the former's demand
being acceded to.
Km in a Jackson's Trial.
The jury in the case of Emma Cleverly, for
merly known as Chita Jackson, failed to agree
after being locked up all night, and the de
fendant was remanded to tae custody of the
Sheriff, with bonds fixed at 52500. She is
charged with stealing jewelry worth $160
from Kittle Duraing.

NEW YORK. N. V.. March 25â There was a
material falling off in the volume of business at
the. Mock- Kxchauge to-day, . the sales of .stock
amounting to 236,392 shares. Speculation through
out was feverish and unsettled, and the tendency
of prices was downward. Professional operators
generally were arrayei on the short side of the
account, but here and there evidences were plain
of covering by Important interests. One | broker,
bud posed to be connected with Keene interests,
bought 50.10 shares of sugar and . 4000 shares of
Jersey. Central. â  These purchases, however, had
little licence on the general market. London
also turned up as a liberal buyer of Ht. Paul and
o.h.r stock c, taking fully 8000 shares of the
former Local traders ignored these developments
and at each advance put un moderate lines. The
decision of the (Supreme Court in the case of the
Trans- Mi*sourl Freight Association ii still ' the
main .bear, argument, and operators for lower
prices seemed to be quite confident that in the end
the court's ru nig would remit in a demoraliza
tion of railway rates.' '

Over a Century.
Patrick Hayes, a resident of Cardiff,
says be remembers tbe French landing at
Bantry Bay in 1798, and be believes that
he was tben about five years old. Tbis
would make Hayes' age somewbere in tbe
neighborhood of 104. Ail efforts to find a
record of tbe man's birth or baptism in
County Cork, where he says both events
took place, bave proved without result, so
his claim to bave passed the century mark
can be admitted or denied, according as
one is disposed or not to credit the autnen
ticity of memories like hia. Most people,
probably, will be disposed to saapect that
bis eaniest r collections arc not of things
he saw but of things about which be was
told. This skeptical att'tude of mind is
thÂ» more excusable in the case of Hayes
because be is still able to walk out in the
coldest weather without an overcoat and
has hardly a gray hair on his thickly cov
ered head.â New York Times.

Mrs. Tower, Nee Smith,
May Preside Over the

The Eccentric Youth Who Vis

Renowned Scholar.
Ho Attributes Much of His Success
lo the Ability of His
Wife.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 25. )
It ia not at all unlikely that Mrs.
Charlemagne Tower, a young lady who
figured prominently in Oakland society
a few years ago, may be the lady who w:ll
preside over the American embassy at
Berlin.
A few years ago a young man from
Philadelphia came to Oakland and cat
quite a figure in society. Ordinarily he
â Would have been called a dude on account
of his pecuiiar method of dreising, but
acquaintance with him would speedily
dissolve the illusion, for young Tower was
v Â£^?ry clever, amiable young gentleman.
â on after arriving Here his engagement
*as announced to the daughter of G.
Frank Smith, a well-Known attorney. Not
Jong afterward there tvas a fashionable
wedding and Mr. and Mrs. Tower went
East.
At that time Mr. Tower was the heir to
a large estate, which lias since come into
his possession, and he and his young wife
have made their home in Philadelohia.
Mr. Tower has since that time made a
name for himself as a writer and he is
now being put forward by the Pennsylva
nia delegation for Embassador to Ger
many. He has a very formidable oppo
nent in the person of Mr. Draper of Mas
sachusetts, aud there is quite as lively a
struggle for the honor between the former
Oakland belle and Mrs. Draper of tue

as 'there is between their respective
husbands. Both ladies are making
an earnest effort toward success, but
each is said to be doing it in a magnani
mous manner, so as to win the respect 01
her rival.
Mr. Tower, who did not create a very
favorable impression in Oakland, is evi
dently more of a man than vras originally
supposed. After he left college he spent
several years traveling as a student, and
was invariably accompanied by his wife.
tie is now famous as a student, scholar,
traveler and author, and he i- very Will
ing to admit that the greatest encourage
ment to study has been derived from his
wife. When his father died he inherited
a fortune of several millions.
During the last two years he has been
lecturer at the Naval War Col.ege, at
Newport, and has published severa his
toric works, including a life of Lafayette,
which is described as a classic
He is now living at Newport with his
wife and some little children, and though
hÂ« moves in the highest stratum of soc

domestic man, and his wife and little

AGAINST IMPROVEMENT.
Amos Slecartney Protests Against Prog
ress on Bay Farm Islandâ The Other -
Â Settlers Demand It.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 25.â 1n re
sponse to the oft-repeated and emphatic
requests of a majority of settlers on Bay
Farm Island the Trustees of the city of
Aiameda, to which jurisdiction the island
belongs, have decided to undertake some
improvement on a certain old thorough
fare known locally as Kilkenny road. To
this -Mr. Mecartney objects. He says that
be is the owner of the greater portion of
the proposed improvements are carried
the property fronting on that street, and if
out tuey will greatly, injure his land, caus
ing it to be overflowed. The settlers who
ask for the improvement do so on the
ground that the road is their most conven
ient means of access to" this city across
the marshes that separate the island from
â¢ the mainland. The City Engineer says
that* Macartney has laid claim to a strip of
land that is really the public highway, ]
-..and the settlers have had much trouble in
'keeping the thoroughfare open.
They allege that Mecartney keeps a
â¢'bad man' in his employ for the purpose
of terrorizing them, said "bad man" hay
ing a record of at least one murder on his
hands, and the peace-loving people of tie ;
Island are in great fear âof him. Alto
gether there has been a good deal of bad
blood stirred up in the peaoeful district
referred to, where, it would seem, as the
ola hymn has it, "Every prospect pleases
end only man is vile." It is not believed
that the Trustees will pay any attention
to Mr. Mecartney' s protest, as the im
provement contemplated is a public ne
cessity.
All About a Ticket.
I ALAMEDA, Cal., March 25.â little
â freeze was created in political ~ circles to-.'
.-^day over the preparation of the sample
ballots for the coming municipal election.
. As heretofore stated, there is little rivalry
for the various positions, but the center of
â what interest thare is hangs about the
contest for City Attorney. There are two
candidates for that officeâ E.K. Taylor,
the incumbent, and R. B. Tappan. On
, the ballot as sent to the printer appeared
the name of Mr. Taylor first and Mr. Tap
pan second. This came to the knowledge
of the last-named* gentleman, and he
claimed that as the law , required the
names to be in alphabetical order bis
(should come first, inasmuch as "Tap"
took precedence over "Tay." A begin
ning was made toward instituting man
damus proceedings to have the order of
the names changed, but the Clerk and the
City Attorney did not wait for it, but
changed the ticket as demanded by Mr.
Tappan. - ' . â¢ ' . . '
* . The Sheriff Balked.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 25.â it ap
pears that the Sheriff congratulated him
self too soon on his supposed success in
serving some ' legal papers upon Mrs.
Olive Speddy, made necessary by a suit
brought by ibe lady in question to recover
damages from the Sheriff and an attorney
â¢for selling a piece of property upon which
be claimed a homestead. , â .â¢- _â â â â â¢;
â¢ The Sheriff supposed that he served the
papers in question upon Mrs., Speddy at
her residence, but it now transpires that it
was not Mrs. Speddy .it all, but her daugh

took the documents without a word, leav

MUST HAVE A HOME.
The Suggestion of the Grand Jury May
Have a Good Effect.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 25.â The neces
sity of providing a home for young chil
dren and others who are arrested, but who
are not necessarily criminal, has been re
vived by the Grand Jurr report filed yes
terday. Mrs. Sanford of tne Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and
Mrs. Lydia Prescott of the Children's So
ciety published their views on the matter
this evening, and from their experience it
is very evident that the suggestion of the
grand jurors was very timely.
Mrs. Prescott, who has had hundreds of
children's cases come under her notice
during the past year, says that such an in
stitution is an absolute necessity.

OAKLAND, Cal., March 25.â The An

all the northern territory to Oakland, has
just completed its canvass of the neigh

677 favored annexation, 322 opposed it and
15 are doubtful.
The report shows that the opponents of
the scheme are very active and have pro
tests in circulation. J. S. Naismith told
tbe meeting that be was informed that
Supervisor Roeth now has twenty-five
men at work on tbe road who have been
instructed, not ODly to vote, but also to
work against annexation.
It has been discovered that there is a
flaw in the petition which the annex
ationists have submitted to the City
Council. Attorney Manning stated that
tbe mistake was a clerical one, which left
out a little strip of land three or four
inches wide by a hundred feet in length,
but it was enough to give the ODponents a
point on which to quibble in court if they
so desired. The error will be explained
to tbe City Council at the next meeting
and if necessary a new petition will be
drawn up.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 26, 1897.
NOT AN HEIR IN
NAME ONLY
0. A. Lane and His Mother
Will Receive a Large
Fortune.
A Lease to Many Acres, Made
Before the Revolution, Has
New Expired.
The Property Is Narly Out of Liti
gation and Ready to Be
Distributed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cat, â¢ [
90S Broadway, March 25. L, )
Stories of the great wealth left to heirs
on the Pacific Slope by ancestors in the
East have become very common and
rarely does the heir see anything more
tangible of his fortune that the story. A
marked change from this state of affairs
is the case of O. A. Lane, a resident of
Oakland and one of the most prominent
leaders in the religious work on tbe
coast.
The fortunate heirs have just received
word that the family estate which has
been in litigation in New York for over
twenty years has been wound up and now
awaits final distribution. All legal objec
tions have been overcome and the case
will soon be out of court entirely and the
property in the hands of the heirs.
Mrs. Sarah J. Lane, who resides at 531
Thirty-third street, is the great-grand
daughter o; Alexander Montgomerj'', who
was the eleventh Earl of Eggleton, Scot
land, which is now held by his descend
ants. He forfeited his right to the title
on coming to this country about the year
1730, when he was fifteen years of age. At
the time of the Revolutionary War Alex
ander Montgomery was about 60 years of
age and he attained much notoriety by
being an offensive royalist. Although he
had forfeited his coronet to lire in this
country when the rebellion broke out ail
his inclinations went toward the British
side of the controversy and he was re
garded as a very obiectionable colonist.
His son, Archibald Montgomery, was the
grandfather of Mrs. Lane. He was a Brit
ish commodore during the Rebellion.
Alexander's political sentiments made it
very uncomfortable for him in New York,
and, following the old English custom of
leasehold transference, he ieaied all bis
property for ninety-nine years and went to
Canada. The property consisted of fifty
six acres in New York and Brooklyn and
surrounding towns. At the time of the
lease it was not of great value, but during
the ninety-nineyears it has increased many ,
fold and is now a valuable property.
Alexander Montgomery died about the
year 1800 in Toronto, Canada. He was a
very methodical and business-like charac
ter and left all his papers and records in
good shape, so that compared with many
other estates it was a very easy matter for
his heirs to prove their rights.
The E gleton family was ont of the most
noted tor Us valor and wealth in the time
of Wallace and Bruce. In Barns' works
mention can be found of the castles of the
Montgomery*, and the heirs have absolute
proof of their descendancy running back
more than nine centuries.
A letter recently received by O. A. Lane
from the family's attorney at Buffalo, N.
V., states that the attorney has all the
original leases and papers including the
map, and that all legal steps have been
taken and everything is ready for final
distribution. It is not known exactly how
large a share will fall to Mrs. Lana and
her son, but it will certainly reach six
figures.
O. A. Lane is an energetic worker in
Baptist circles. He has filled several im
portant positions in Christian Endeavor
worK, and has been in business in this
city about six years.

Death of M. J. Crook*.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 25.â Matthew
J. Crooks, who has lived in Oakland for
twenty years, died last night at his home,

ters. He was a brother of Jackson Crooks,
who accidentally shot himself at Santa
Cruz about a year ago.
May Lioie an Eye.
OAKLAND, Cat,., March 25.â Deputy
Coroner Henry Quellin met with a serious
accident to-day which may cau-e him the
loss of one eye. He was engaged in em
balming a corpse, and in forcing the fluid
into the body the tube burst. Some of
the corrosive poison flew into his right
eye and burned the skin of his face. Re
lief was speedily obtained, but there is
yreat danger that one eye__niay be ren

BALLOTS GUARDED.
Many Humors That They Might Be
Tampered With.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 25.â A1l kinds
of rumors of attempts to tamper with the
ballots cast at the recent election are being
circulated, but there does not seem to bo
any legitimate foundation for them.
Captain Thomas, the Mayor-elect, was in
formed the day after election that an
effort would be made to tamper with the
ballots. He communicated his information
to Chief Lloyd, and as there is noi at the
City Hall a vault large enough to contain
all the envelopes, Chief Lloyd has de
tailed Officers Wood and Henderson to
keep watch. These two men relieve each
other, and at no lime are the ballots left
unguarded.
"As soon as I heard of the reported at
tempt to touch the ballots," said Chief
.Lloyd to-day, "I ordered an officer on
guard. On learning tuai Clerk Tompkins
had no place in which to securely store
the returns I placed one of our cells at bis
disposal. He, however, would not accept
this, because he thought that by moving
the ballots he might get them out of his
jurisdiction, and he did not wish to take
any chances an view of the threatened
litigation. I have kept two men on guard
ever since that time."
Captain Thomas is satisfied that no one
has had an opportunity to interfere with
the ballots unless they took it the first
night they were in the clerk's custody.
It was stated to-day that the papers de
manding a recount will be filed by Attor
ney de Golia on behalf of Mayor Davie
to-morrow.

standers rushed to the rescue and lifted
the couple out of daneor just in time.
Planked TOhitefish aud Shad.
Planking fish is, as a rule, confined to
clubhouses, where larsre open fires are ac
cessible, but Mis. 8. T. Rorer in the Ladies'
Home Journal tells how planked fish may
be served to perfection in the smallest and
most modest home in America. "The
peculiar flavor imparted by the heating
plank makes the fish more delicious than
when cooked in any other way. If one
has a gas stove the method is quite
simple, but the oven of a coal range
may also be used with success. Secure
a two-inch plank the size of the oven, made
Jrom hard wood, oak or hickory; when
ready to use put it in the oven until it is
so hot that you cannot bear your hand on
it for an instant. Have the fi3h split down
the back; put it, akin down, on the hot
plank; dust with salt and pepper and
baste with melted butter. In an ordinary
coal stove, put it on the oven bottom,
close the oven door and bake for thirty
minutes, basting two or three times. When
the fish is done take it from the oveu,
garnish with parsley and lemon and send
it to the table on the plank, placed on a
Japanese lacquer tray just a little larger
than the plank. White fish may be
planked in tne same way."
To Properly Address the President.
Ex-President Harrison, who details "A
Day With the President at His Desk" in
the Ladies' Home Journal, relates some
of the amusing solutions of ihe perplex
ing problem as to the proper way to
address the President: "Sometime* he
is addressed by letter- writers as plain
'Mister,' sometimes as 'His Majesty,' or
'His Lordship,' and very frequently a?
'His Excellency.' 'The High Govern
ment at Washington' was thought to be
an appropriate address by one writing
from Austria, and a letter addressed to
the 'White Office' was rightly assigned by
tbo intelligent mail clerk to the White
House. The official title of the head of
the Executive Department is 'The Presi
dent.' All propositions to add adorning
but superfluous titles were rejected in
Washington's time. The correct letter
address is, therefore, 'To the President,'
and the oral address, 'Mr. President.' "
Why He Marveled.
'â¢It's very interesting," said young Mr.
Giggs' tailor, "to read about some of the
customs of the people in Asia."
"I suppose bo," was tlio reply.
"I bays just learned that in that part of
the world every man makes it a rule to
pay all his bills on tbe tirsi of each year."
"You don't say so !"
"Yes; and what strikes me as the most
extraordinary part of it is that those are
the people to whom we send missionaries
in order to civilize them." â Washington

Josenh Marristany, the old capitalist of
Alameda, has been sued by bis young wife
for a divorce. Great surprise was mani
fested two years ago when it became
known that the bride, wbo was then but
25 years of age, had become the wife of
the elderly groom, who was fast approach*

In her complaint the young wife charges
cruelty and says that her fatherly bus
band u-eii very bard words toward her.
They lived happily together for a few
months, but the wife now alleges that she
could not stand the threats and horrible
names that she was railed, much less
could she endure the blows which she al
legea were frequently and liberally ac
corded her.
Mr. Marristany is an old resident of this

A Man Who ; Drags the Carriage ' That
Con Toys Bis Family..
!>' It is not necessary to go to Timbactoo or
Chimborazo to see queer Bights. They
may be seen right bore in Louisville, and
two of them were seen this morning. -
At about 9 o'clock people passing along
Jefferson street stopped ana gazed at a
spectacle that has not been seen in these
parts for i some time, certainly. A small,
stout man, harnessed -to a cart like a
lowly beast of burden, passed down the
street. lie was oblivious of the attention
he was attracting and kept bis eyes di
rected to the ground, that he might avoid
rough places. . ;" v v :\ â 'â : â¢'- -ty?. %tÂ±*iÂ£
In the cart sat a woman. She was also
unconscious of the passers, but it was the
unconsciousness of self-possession. At
times she would loak at her husband, for
'such he was, and then at the crowd, with
an air that said, "That's the way to have
'em trained." - .
â  ' Scattered about the' cart and perched in
all. available places were six small chil
dren. They romped and enjoyed -them
selves in the consistent style of happy
childhood.. The family's household effects
were also hung in and onto the cart. '
) This was the Hawea family from Ohio.:
Harmon Hawes, the - bead of the : family,
was the man in the shafts; Mrs. Hawes,
the better half, was the woman who rode,
and the six children '. were ; six little
Haweses. They continued down Jefferson
street to i the , City , Hall. Then . Hawes
drew around to central station and pro
ceeded â¢;. to â¢ unharness himself, f Having
done so rhe ; stretched "; himself several
times, while some oi the crowd 1 that had
collected listened closely to him - bray.
One fresh party offered him a handful of
hay. After he had drawn a few breaths
Hawes told his story to Station-keeper
Bmltr. â .:<,::...>;â â ';:::â â â ; : -r'r \'3:J*.'~p'-Â£p"~ '' .
, He said that two months ago his home
in Ohio was destroyed by fire. He had no
place to stay : and no way to 5 pet : a : fresh'
start. So he decided to make his way to
Nashville, to be ; there : for the exposition
and. the revival it is expected to bring.
Having no money; for transportation and
no horse, he determined to act as horse
himself. .j,;v' / â  â â :â¢;..'â¢ .-/â¢-, / ' ;..
He ban drawn this family of seven every
bit of the way from Hurly County, travel

one asked him bow i he : made a living for
them. In answer Hawes took off his hat
and passed it around. â¢:.'â¢': V ; ',
, The family has been sleeping at nights
wherever they could find. Sometimes
they have been compelled to sleep in the

expect to get an engagement with a side

After a good rest Hawes took bis posi

his way south, via the Seventh-street
road.â Louisville Post.
UP IN A BALLOON.
The Aeronaut Tells a Story Oat of His
Experience in the Profession.
Something or other suggests*! the snb
ject. and the tall man who sat at the hotel
tsib!e where he couldn't see the man oppo
site owing to the caster which stood be
tween stuck his fork into a potato and be
gan talking.
"I suppose," he said, "that when Elijah
went to lioavn in a liand-baÂ«ket he liked
it and it was all right, but as for me I'd
rather go by land."
The men at the foot of the table looked
up questioningly.
"By the graveyard, of course, I mean,"
hastily explained the taJker. "You see
this aerial navigation business ain't any
good after you've had a 'rassle' with it
that pulls all of a man's nerve 3 out by the
roots, twists them around a stump and
then begins to yank and saw on them.
Y' understand what I mean? I used to be
an aeronaut, I did. I guess I must have
made a thousand ascensions. Out in my
State for a long time no county fair was
complete without me, and I got the to
pograpdy of the State down so fine from
my birdseye view of it that I could draw a
map of the whole layout with my eyes
slm . Great thing it was to be sailing
through tue air in them days, and I
thought I never would get enough of it,
until one fine afternoon a rope broite in a
ticklish place and it gave me a kind of
nervous fit, just as it does a railroad en
gineer when he has an accident and isn't
hurt that anybody can see. Just the same
he is hurt, and so was I, but I kept on; so
doe? the engineer.
"After that, though, I didn't go up feel
ing quite as sassy as I used to feel, and
sometimes as I would go shooting up
ward I'd wonder bow hard the ground
was in case a man had to light sudden. I
always done a trareze act in connection
with my performance, and, if I do say it
niyself/it wasn't any slouch of a trapeze
show. And I didn't like that half as well
af :er the rope broke as I did before, either.
Indeed, I begun to think the whole dern
balloon business wasn't what it was
cracked up to be. I was thinking about
tying a rope around my waiac so as to
catch hold of things if I fell, but I didn't
like to do that, though there was about
100 feet of rope I had hung out as an
anchor or grab, with a hook on the end to
help me to land when the show was over.
"When I retired from business there
was a State fair going on that week, and
I went up every day. It was a fine day,
with ju?t enoueh wind to move the bal
loon along majestic, as the papers said,
and when I shot up I was so nervous that
I actually said my prayers as I saw the
ground dropping away from me. But
I took a braca on myself, and began
my trapeze act, the balloon going
up faster than I ever felt it By
the time I was up half a mile my
turn was to swing with my knees around
the bar, which looked mighty danger
ous, but it really wasn't any worse than if
I had been in a theater without a net.
We 1, I give myself the swine and I never
did know why, but I lost my grip, and
with a swish I felt myself tiy out into
space. The Lord knows what I thought
about, but it wasn't for long, for I didn't
know any more nntil I came to in the
room at the hotel where I was stopping."
"Come off," interrupted the man at tha
foot of the table. 'Ton cant lell tin-;
crowd you fell half a mile and didn't get
killed. "You are a plain, unvarnished liar,
that's what you are."
"You're another if you say I said I fell
half a mile," responded the retired aero
naut, and it looked as if there might be a
scrap.
"What I did do," he continued, when
peace was restored, "was to strike that an
ciior line within ten feet of tbeend of it as
it trailed under me, and by some act of a
merciful providence the anchor flew
around my body and caught the roi>e
above, thus looping me in. There I hung
until the balloon came down, and as every
body below saw the accident you may
imagine that I had a big reception when I
landed, though I didn't know anything
about it. I did know, though, that I
couldn't tempt providence twice, and ao I
quit and went to editing a country news
paper, which is more lingerinc than fall
ing out of a balloon."â New York Sun.
SPEAKEKS OF THE HOUSE.
Many Who Were Famom and Many
Who Were Not.
There have been nfty-four Congresses.
TÂ£ere have been tbirty-two Speakers of
the House of Representatives. When the
term "Speaker" originated in England it
was the custom for the Sovereign to de
liver orally to Parliament such communi
cation as he desired to make at the com
mencement of a session. The House so
addressed responded to the communica
tion. The presiding officer headed a pro
cession oi members of the House, waited
upon the Sovereign and read the response,
thus speaking for the whole body; there
from comes the term "Speaker," which wo
adopted from the British Parliament. The
first Congress heard Washington's address
and prepared a reply, which the Speaker,
accomoanied by the members of the
House, delivered to the President on May
8, 1789.
Thomas Jefferson determined that bis
communications to Congress sbonld be
made by written message; and that no an
swer would be expceted. This lea to a
general change in this regard in Congress
and other American legislative bodies.
Notwithstanding this the title "speaker"
has adhered, and many of the former
Speakers may be included, if not, indeed,
all oi them, in one of two classes; either
they may have become celebrated after
ward in the field of National politics or
they have become totally obscure. In the
former class are to be included: Henry
Clay, who was the Speaker in three Con
gresses, and was, moreover, a United
States Senator, Secretary of State, and re
peatedly a candidate for President; John
Bell of Tenne see who was Secretary of
War, United States Senator and a candi
date for President in 1860. James
K. Polk, who was the eleventh
President of the United States, inaugu
rated in 1845, ten years after he became
Speaker; Robeit M. T. Hunter of
Virginia, who was United States Senator
and Confederate Secretary of War;
Robert C. Winthrop of Massachusetts,
who waa an United States Senator from
the Bay State i Howell Cobb of Georgia,
who was Governor of that State, Secretary
of the Treasury uuder President Buchanan
and a member of the Confederate Con
press; GaUisha A. Grow, a veteran mem
ber of Congress, who, born in Connecticut
in 1823, was elocted in November a Repre
sentative from Pennsylvania; Nathaniel
P. Banks, Schuyler Cotfax, afterward Vice-
President; James G- Blame, twice Secre
tary of State, an United States Senatoi
from Maine, and Republican candidate for
President in 1884; John G. Carlisle,
afterward United States Benator and
Secretary of the Treasury; Charles F.
Crisp of Georgia and Thomas B.
Reed, the present Speaker of Congress.
These are someâ but not all â of the
Speakers who have obtained celebrity.
The list of Speakers who aro little re
membered is perhaps even longer. In re
cent years tbere has been J. Warren
Keiferof Ohio. Before the war there was
William Pennington of New Jeriev, who
had been Governor of that Btate â he was
elected Governor 23 years before be be
came Speakerâ Â»nd there was Andrew
Stevenson of Virginia, who presided over
the deliberations of four successive
American Congresses, and was the only
SpenlcÂ°r to do so. Few per'ons of ihff

You Can Have Your tye Tattooed.
The latest discovery of scientific medical
men is that the human eye may be tat
tooed any color. It is now quite within
the bounds of possibility lor doctors to tat
too a man's eye bright scarlet or green.
Of course, eyes are only tattooed in cases
where one of them is blind, ami i.as as
sumed in consequence a peculiar dead and
ghastly appearance. An eye in this con
dition will entirely disfigure a face; but a
modern oculist may color one ox these
"dead" eyes, and restore it to its natural
appearance, so that nothing but the closest
scrutiny can detect the difference between
it and its fellow.
The operation of tattooing is performed
by tirat treating the eye with cocaine until
it becomes absolutely senseless to pain.
When all is ready the part to be operated
upon is covered thickly with India ink of
the required color. The tattooing is then
performed by means of a little electrical
machine whicii operates a specially mad ;
needle. â Answers.

ECHOES FROM
ROUND VALLEY
Yes Palmer Acquitted of
Stealing a Bald-Face
Steer.
He Is the Chief Witness in the
John Littlefieid Murder
Case.
Frank Youree Also Before the Fed.
eral Court for Illegally Selling
L quor.
It has cost the Government of tie United
States many hundreds of dollars to find
that S. B. Pairaer did not steal a steer
worth $25. The caÂ«e as it appeared in the
records of the United States District
Court before yesterday would have led the
public to believe that "Yes" Palmer of
the Long Ridge district, near Round Val
ley, was a common cattle-thief; that he
stole from the Mendocino County Indian
reservation a bald-face beef animal, and
District AUorney H. S. Foote would have
it "against the peace and dignity of the
United States of America and contrary to
the form of the statutes of the said United
States of America in such case made and
provided."
As a matter of fact and record this was
one of tae many side issues of the Round
Valley feud between the family of Palmer
and George E. White, the ex- king of
Round Valley. Yes Palmer and White's
gang had been "at outs" for years and
many efforts were made by the latter to
get Palmer out of the way. Palmer and
His friends were as hsndy with their six
shooters a* any of White's men, so that
plan failed to work. In the course of the
trouble Jack Littlefieid was murdered by
Joe Gregory and his crowd of ruffians
Gregory Is now serving a thirty-year
sentence for the crime and be lias the
companionship of others who assisted in
riddling Littlefield's body with bullets
and afterward hanging the mutilated
corpse to a tree. And still there are
others who are to be prosecuted for parti
cipation in the same outrage.
Palmer was one who knew all about the
death of Jack Littletield and it was on
his testimony that Gregory and his com
panions were convicted. His store of
knowledge is still far from being ex
haunted, and some who are still free fear
for their future liberty. Up at Palmer's
home tie does not bear the reputation of
being a cattle-thief, so such a charge there
would heve been to no purpose. How
ever, some one cot the case before the
United States Grand Jury and a bill of in
dictment was found charging Vest with a
crime against the Federal laws. It took a
long time to get the matter into the Fed
eral court, for the alleged crime was said
to have been committed away back in 1894.
District Attorney Foote did not propose
that the Government should be robbed of
even a $25 bald-faced steer, for all that
much time bad elapsed. By some hook
or crook the witnesses for Palmer were
not brought from the mountains when
the case was called yesterday, although
the subrenas had been issued.
However, the defendant's attorney, upon
learning that the principal witness for the
prosecution was the convict Joe Gregory,
decided to go on, supported by only a few
witnesses, such as Lem Sallady, John Sim
mons the bear-slayer and Frank Youree,
all well known in Round Valley history, i
Gregory was brought from prison and tes
tified that the bald-faced steer In question
was driven by Palmer from the reserva
tion; that it was branded "U.S." aud
further marked by certain earmarks use 1
by the Government on its cattle. The de
fendant acknowledged that be drove from
the reservation the steer in question and j
that he converted the animal into roasts |
and steaks. He said he had a right to do j
so because the animal belonged to bis wile
and i hat the creature was not branded or
marked with the brand or earmarks of
the Government. The jury believed his
story and returned a verdict of acquittal
in less than three minutes.
There is still another feature to this
many-pointed story of the Round Valley
feud and the killing of John LittleneM.
Among the witne^se 1 * in the murder case
ia Frank Y'>uree, who, like Palmer, is in
the way of certain people. About the
time that Palmer was indicted for cattle
stealine Ycuree was indicted by the Fed
eral Grand Jury for selling liquor to an
Indian In violation of Federal laws. The
bill was put on the secret tile. It is not
known what efforts, if any, were made to
Berve the warrant for Youree's arrest, but
nevertheless he did not go into biding,
ana the bill has been on the secret tile
ever since. However, when the case of
Palmer was called yesterday, Youree was
on hand and saved the Marshal from the
bother of making an arrest uy putting up
bail for his appearance in court when the
liquor case is caiied.
TOOK LITTLE TAD A EIDR
An Old Engineer* Story of an Expert
ence With President Lincoln.
I had enlisted in 1&61 nt Rochester, N.
V., and was firing on a New York Central
engine when I quit to be a soldier for
Uncle Sam. My enlistment papers show
ing what my occupation had been, 1 was
detailed to run an engine on. a little road
reaching from Washington down into
Virginia, that was being operated by the
Government as far down as the boys in
blue commanded the situation. At this
time I made a round trip each day, leaving
Washington at 10 a. m. and arriving in
Washington on my return at 4 p. m.
One morning, while I sat in the cab of
my engine reading a newspaper to pass
the hour or more that would brine us to
our starting time, 1 became conscious,
without paying any particular attention
to them, that a gentleman and a youth
were examining my engine, walking
slowly around it. At length my attention
was attracted by a question the boy put to
the man:
"Papa, can't we get up on it? Ask the
gentleman, please/
Before he could comply with the boy's
reauest I laid aside mv paper and invited
the two to step up. When they did so I
noticed that the gentleman was quite tall.
He had to remove his high silk hat nnd
then stand in a slightly stooping position
while in the cab. I noticed from his an-
Bwers to the questions which the boy plied
to him and his explanations of different
pans of the machine that he knew some
thing of the principle upon which locomo
tives are bnilt.
"Oh, papa! I do wish I could take a
ride on it."
"Not now, my son. Maybe some day
we may have a chance, then I -hall be
glad to let you ride on one of these great
machines in which you take such an in
terest."
I said : "If you and your son will take a
seat over there on the fireman's box, I
will be glad to give the young man a lit
tle ride. 1 want to pump her up, any
way." He thanked me as bo and the boy
seated themselves. I set the lever,
opened the throttle slightly, and we
move;l slowly down the yard and out to
the Washington end of the Lone Bridge
across the Potomac. The gentleman ex
plained to the boy all of my acts in con
trolling the machine and its movements
in a manner that showed he knew the
locomotive very well.
"Oh, papa, I do wish I could take a long
ride on this engine out in the country,
where it goes fast. It must bo grand to
!>e carried away by such a big strong
hor^-e."
As the engine slowly backed once more
into the sheds the gentleman again
thanked me, and as I caught the wistful
look in the boy's face I was prompted to
say:
"My run is only three hours out and
three bacs, sir. I leave here at 10 a. m
and return at 4:30 p. m. If you are willing
to trust the boy to nic I will take htm for
the trip here in front of me on my seat.
The road is safe. We do not go into the
enemy's country. I think I can safely
promise to deliver the young man to you
at this spot at 4:30 this afternoon."
"P;ipa| papa, do let me go ! It will be so
nice, and I know this gentleman will see
that no barm comes to me. Do let mÂ« go,
papa, and don't tell mamma until I get
t aefc. I want to surprise her by telling
her all about the trip."
The gentleman could not withstand his
son's pleading. He let him go.
Words fail to tell of the de;ight of that
boy as we i sped oorv >r the hills and valleys
of Virginia. From the questions he asked
I soon discovered he was a Western boy
from the prairie land.
As the engine puffed and groaned up a
long grade on Â»he return trip, suddenly
the boy, who sat between my knees, looked
up into my face and said:
"I have got the very best papa that ever
lived. Do you know my papa?"
"No, my boy, Ido not; but there was
something so familiar to me in his ap
pearance that ever since you climbed into
this cab I have been trying to think where
I have seen your father before. What is
his name, anywa y?"
"\Vny, he is Abraham Lincoln,'' replied
my fellow-traveler.
For a moment I reeled on my seat in
surprise , but soon it flashed on me that
the tall man who bad placed the child in
my charge could be no other than the
President, whom I had only seen as pic
tured in the newspapers.
You may be sure I made a donbly care
ful run into Washington when I found
that Tad Lincoln, son of the President,

A ROAST
FOR THE
FACULTY
Plain Words of Editor Hop
per of the Occi
dent.
TROUBLE BREWING IN
BERKELEY.
Student Journalism Is Turned
Against College Pro
lessors.
IT MAT END IN A COURSE OF
SUPPRESSION.
Nervy R marks That the University
Authorities Do Not Like and
May Si. Upcn
BERKELEY, Cal., March 25.â Editor
Hopper ("98) of the Occident sprung one
more sensation in his weekly to-day, by
pubhÂ»hiug an article on the system of
university governmental Berkeley which
has aroused much discussion. The name
"Rienzi" was signed to the production,
which is an attack upon President Kel
logg and the Jacully in general. The
writer discusses affairs with singular free
dom, and it is whispered that iho faculty
may sit upon such methods of journalism.
Among the students the matter is
looked UDon with varying views, but
there iÂ« a general tendency to object to
sucu matter being published, anony
mously at leÂ«9t.
"Rienzi" states that the university is
"not so much a single institution as a
number of separate departments held to
gether by a common name and a common
treasury. Each department head is a sort
of petty sovereign suspicious of his neigh
bor", jealous of his rights and owning
but scant allegiance to the central au
thority."
The chief evil arising from this state of
affairs is declared lo be that "it stands as
an effectual bar to the university ever get
ting anu keeping a president of the stamp
it needs." Tue nervy student writer says
further:
It is an open secret that the heads of de
partments do no 1 want a strong hnnct at the
helm. A man of energy and idea- at the
head of the university, possessing the confi
dence of the regents, would mean an end to
departmental autonomy, the ideal to which
our protestors uavj t-teadily and persistently
worked, and to-day practically attained. With
the position of head of department abolished,
the power going with the position would
gradually fall more and more to the president.
It would then be to the best interest of every
one to have that position held by a strong,
broad-minded, progressive, scholarly man,
and all would unite toward that end. With
the greater homogeneity, that this would
bring" we might hope to see an end to the
cliques ana intrigues, plotting and counter
plotting that to-day ruu riot m tne govern
ment of the university.
As to the faculty at large the following
remr.rks are made:
A large department ought to have two or
three mea of ability and reputation. But
this is not possible unless we once and for all
give up the idea ot having only one full pro
lessor in eacn department. If we are to have
several men of equal Rbility they must have
equal rank. No university can hope to be
come great wh:ch having once selected its
department chief is ever after debarred secui
ing another mitn of talent and reputation.
Such a condition of affairs, dangerous for any
university, is doubly dangerous for one just
beginning to develop a graduate department
and still saddled with department beads
obtained during and suited to its college days.
Our present absurd system compels us to
git idly by waiting fur incompetent men to
grow old and retire, while the growth cf tne
university Is retarded or perverted.
Tbe remedy f r these evils is declared to
be abolition of departmental government.
THEY ASK FOR A SCHOOL.
Snnnyaide l-eaideut* Present Their
Grievance to the JJoard of
Education.
D. H. Wyckoff, William Wilson and W.
A. Hicks of the Sunnyside Improvement
Club have been appointed to draft a peti
tion to tbe Board of Education, asking for
the location of a primary school in the
district.
The present petition is the renewal of
one which was presented about two years
aRO, when the property-owners donated
four lots, at Flood avenue and Edna street,
to the City, having been promised that
the building would be erected Defore July
1, 1896. The City accepted the land. The
plans were prepared, aud bids were ac
cepted last year lor the new school, but
the Board of Education found that it
wouLi be impossible, to erect tbe building,
because there was not sufficient money iv
the fund.
The present application is made in time
for both the Supervisors and the School
Directors to provide in the next tax-levy
sufficient funds to erect the building.
In addition to the need of a school the
residents have still another cause of com
plaint, and this is the inconvenience of
reaching either the San Jose or the Mis
sion road except by a roundabout journey
of over two miles. An outlet is desired
through tbe market garden;:, which now
block traffic between Sunnyside and tbe
Excelsior Homestead.
With tiie railroad track of the Southern
Pacific Company running alone there
under a deep cut.it is thought that a
bridge leading out of Bemis into Thirty
fourth street would answer the purpose
and be a benefit to all concerned.
MAY QUILL'S DEATH.
Fifty Thousand l-Â»ollarÂ« Damages De
manded of the Railroad Company,
The case of Anthony Quill against the
Southern Pacific Company is on trial be
fore a jury in Judge Dainzerfield's depart
ment of the Superior Court. The action
is to recover $50,000 damages on account
of the killing of plaintiff's daughter, May
Quill,' by a railroad accident.
Matt L .Sullivan is attorney for, Mr.
Quill, and Attorney Ackerman of the firm
of Napbthalv. Friedenrich A : Ackerman
appear as legal representatives fur the cor
poration.
It is noted in this connection that the
railroad .; company: has ] recently. beg to
distribute its cases among several of ; the
legal' firms of the City, instead of giving
all the patronage to one or two men, as
was formerly the rule. 1
At a former ' trial of this case the jury
failed to -agree. The i present trial will
probably occupy a week's time. â 
Big Suits Against the Ho{Â« Estate.
Alicia Hoge. executrix of the estate of Wal
ter Hoge, deceased, baa been sued by Eugene
â Â»". Long, trustee for and guardian of the

also known as Lillie O'Connor, $21,840 43.
BIG ATHLETIC SHOW.
The T. M. C. A. to i xceed All Previous
Attempts of That Department
Xo-Ntght.
The gymnasium members of the Youne
Men's Christian Association will have
their turn to show what they have accom
plisned during the past few months to
night. There is to be the greatest gym
nastic entertainment ever attempted by
this department, and the members have
been hard at work under the direction of
Dr. H. L. Dieiz, the physical director.
Among the special numbers may be
mentioned the following: The carnival of
sports, which will be presented for the
hrst time, illustrates the different athletic
sports of to-ilay. George Baker will show
His skill with n 26-pound cannon ball,
doing; some very difficult feats. Adele
Edna Ktliogg, a little iady of lv summers,
but who can swin^ Indian clubs to. per
fection, will assist Dr. Dieiz, tue cham
pion 01 the West, in niaKinu this number
a spec al leature of the evening.
The ladies' class has a brand new fancy
march, with all the turns, twists and
wiieels imaginable, and, not satisfied with
that, will show their control of the Indian

Claims That Tcere Are Too Many
Fads Tiu?iit â Hgh-School
Course Tro Short.
Superintendent of Schools Reginald H.
WeDster bas taken hold of the reins of
government in i:is new office with a firm
hand and is prepaiing to present some im
portant measures to the consideration of
the Board of Educational an early date.
Mr. Webster is of the opinion that there
are too many fads occupying the attention
of toe pupils in ihe primary schools and
that several of them snoul J be eliminated
in order lhat the scholars may have more
time to devote to such necessary branches
as reading, writing and arithmetic.
"I have been looking closely into the
matter of the branches taught primary
school children," said Mr. Webster j-ea
terday, "and 1 have come to the conclu
sion that tome of them may be left out of
their studies and never be missed. There
are too many fads and too little of com
mon school studies.
"For instance, sewing and cookine
might be dropped, or at least curtailed,
and reading and writing and arithmetic
given more note. Drawing and music
are very nice accomplishments, but I fail
to see why they should occupy so much
time and attention. They .-eem to me
better suited for the leisure hoars of the
children when at home. I shall recom
mend to Ihe board thut some changes
along the lines be made.
"Another matter that I shall call to the
attention of the board is the length 01 the
high school course. I tnink that three
years is too little and that better results
would be attained if it were increased to
four years. We would turn out more tin
isned pupils who would reflect greater
ciedi; on tho department."
NEW POLICE STATION.
The Commissioners Assign a Sergeant

'. . Keeper*.
The Police Commissioners on Wednesday
niebt assigned Sergeant John Mooney to
take charge of the new station on O'Far

men Joseph J. Burnett and Gregory P.
Harrington to be station- keepers.
â  The new station, a description of which
appeared in The Call several weeks ago,
has now been completed and made ready
for occupation.
The men detailed in the. district, which
includes" west of Steiner street to the

will report for duty at the new station to
night. Sergeants Tobin and Christiansen,
who have been in ths district for some
time, will remain there. The district is

CHOYNSKI AND MAHEK.
The Olympic Club Will Endeavor to
Secure a Match fur April.
The Olympic Club director.-) met last
evening and decided to give Howard Tay
lor, the leader cf the club, full power to
act with regard to the making of matches
for the club's professional fistic carnival,
which will be held in Mechanics' Pavilion
some time in April.
Mr. Taylor said that he bad tried every
means to get Tommy Ryan of Syracuse,
N. V., to meet George Green, but that the
Eastern fighter is evidently afraid to meet
the clever Californian.
To-day Mr. Taylor will wire Peter
Maher and Joe Choynski regarding the
amount of parse they would consent to
fight for in this City.
If Choynski refuses to meet Maher
an off r will be raaOe to Tom Sharkey,
but the friends of the latter say that the
sailor has a wnolasorae respect for the big
right fist of the Irishman and will conse
quently demand a purse which he knows
the Olympic Club, or any otner club for
that matter, cannot afford to give. Judg
ing from the present outlook it is almost
safe to ?ay that the Olympic Club will get
a twenty-round go between Choynski and
Maher.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, FRIDAY, MARCH 26, 1897.
m
DURRANT DID NOT
MURDER WARE
So Captain I. W. Lees
Most Emphatically
Declares.
Says He Ran the Story Down
Several Months
Ago
He Resents the Insinuation Directed
Against the Unhappy Minnie
Williams.
Considerable amusement was created in
police circles yesterday over the reappear
ance in one o! the dailies of the old yarn
that Theodore Durrani, the convicted
murderer of Blanche Lamont, was also the
slayer of Eugene Ware, the hapless drug
clerk who was butchered two years ago
in the St. Nicholas pharmacy.
This time a Mrs. Norman Sharer ap
pears in the role of accuser. Many others
have suffered this same nightmare before,
and they caused Captain Lees and his ret
inue of Hawksbaws no end of torment
and wild-goose chasing.
But Mrs. Shaver's rather overdue vision
is destined to create no excitement among
the bluecoats whatever. The story iÂ»
taken as a joke, particularly in view of
the fact that the new accuser, in relating
her tale, confesses that she has absolutely
no evidence of its truth and acknowledges
that she can go no further than to sus
pect.
"It's all rot," was the blunt manner in
which Captain Lees replied to p question
yesterday, regarding the merits of tne
story. "I don't know this Mrs. Shaver,"
ne continued, "and would not like to say
anything that could be construed as being
disrespectful. But it is all nonsense,
nevertheless. Hud she possessed any
information as to the identity of Ware's
murderer, she would have come forward
long ago and consulted with the police.
1 ran mat Durrant story down long ago,
and I know what I am talking about when
I say there is nothing in it.
"In the first place Durrant and Ware
were not acquainted, as Mrs. Shaver's
story would imply. At least I could never
secure any evidence that they knew each
other, and 1 worked that theory out very
thoroughly.
*'I do not propose to pay any attention
to this new â or rather, oldâ story at all.
It would be but a waste of time and
energy, especially after tne ground has all
been worked over before. Besides all this
Mrs. bliaver does not really say anything.
All one can make out of her statement is
that sue thinks or believes Durrant had
something to do with Ware's murder, and
bases ttie-e suspicions upon some alleged
strange actions and moody spells pn the
part of Minnie Williams. I teil you there
is nothing in it."
Captain Lees also took exception to the
ins nuation that Minnie Williams was
rather too well acquainted with Ware to
suit Durrant, and tnat the latter was
prompted to murder the crippled drug
clerk by a jealous heart. The veteran
criminai-catcuer says he investigated the
murdered girl's character thoroughly, and
satisfied himself that a purer and more
respectable little lady did not exist in San
Francisco. He pronounces the innuendo
cruel and heartless.
"The jealou-y theory is as ridiculous as
tbe rest of the story." said the captain.
"Ware was dead and burled before Dur
rant and Minnie became acquainied.
Ware was murdered in December, 1894,
and Miss Williams lost her life in April,
1895. She met and became acquainted
with Durrant only a month before he
butchered her in that church library. So,
you see, that explodes that jealousy
theory."
Mrs. Shaver herself seems to be rather
sorry she spoke. She adheres to her sus
picions, however, but says her remarks
and statements have been exaggerated.
The lady says she has absolutely no tangi
ble evidence showing tnat Durrant slew
Ware, but -he always imagined that Min
nie Williams knew something of the de
tails or thought she did. That is all there
is to it.
Durrant takes tbe whole thing as a good
joke. "Why, of course," he said yester
day, "I murdered everybody. It's a won
der somebody doesn't charge me with in
stigating the Armenian massacres. These
stories make me laugu. Why, I never
knew Ware in my life, much less pos
sessed a desire to siayhim."
Durrant added that in his opinion Mrs.
Shaver's tale was but a revamp ol the old
story alleged to have been started by Sis
ter Julia. She was alleged to have said
that she saw Durrant at the St. Nicholas
Pharmacy on that fÂ»tal night, and the
story traveled everywhere. But when
brought back to its a ieged source the
story was flatly danied by Sister Julia,
and that put an end to it.
O'BRIEN'S HARD LUCK.
Under Bonds to Finish the New City
Hall Roof, and Jailed by Judge
Wallace for Doing the Work.
Contractor James J. O'Brien was fined
|500 and condemned to live days' imprison
ment in the County Jail by Judge Wallace
yesterday for contempt of court.
Mr. O'Brien has been engaged by the
New City Hall Commissioners to put a
new roof on the new City Hall, ana had
his men at work directly over Judge
Wallace's courtroom yesterday morning,
and the hammering caused a deafening
noise. His Honor lrowned and said to
Bailiff P. J. Curtis:
"Mr. Bailiff, go up on the roof and tell
the man in charge of those men that he
must stop that row. There is the liberty
of a human being at stake here, and the
nuisance cannot be tolerated."
Mr. Curtis went as directed, and soon
returned. As he entered the courtroom,
the hammers fairly thundered on the
planks above.
Nothing could be done, so a temporary
rest, was eiven to the lawyers and the
jurors. When Mr. Curtis teturned Judge
Wallace shouted above the div:
"Well, Mr. Bailiff, well?"
"He says he can't stop," returned Curtis.
"What's that?" demanded the Judge,
snatching up a pencil and fumbling for
his glasses. "Give me that man's name.
Who is he?"
"Suppose be's the contractor."
"Well, go fetch him," said his Honor.
"Go up on the roof and brine him in
here."
Away went the bailiff again, and pres
ently returned with the contractor, Mr.
0' Bnen, who grinned as he entered the
judicial presence. Judge Wallace called
nim to the bench and in a whisper told
him the noise must cease. O'Brien re
plied deferentially, but said that ha was
under bonds 10 finish the work as rapidly
as possible and that City and County At
torney Creswell had ordered him to pro
ceed, saying that i; any Judges com
plained lie was to refer them to him.
"Well, I make the order that this noise
cease right now," insisted the Judge. "If
you proceed it will be at your peril."
"I'll see Mr Creswell," suggested
O'Brien.
"I don't care what you do," returned
his Honor. "I shall stop this uproar.
There is a trial going on here and the evi
dence cannot bo heard. Mr. Clerk, kindly
note tnat I make tbe order that this dis
turbance cease at once.
There was no more noise daring the
forenoon session, but when the afternoon
session began there was another interrup
tion by the workmen's hammers. Judge
Wallace again sent up and Contractor
O'Brien was brought before him and asked
what be meant.
The contractor said he was doing tbe
work under the advice of City and County
Attorney Creswell.
Jud-e Wallace then found O'Brien guilty
of contempt and ordered him committed
to jail for five days and to pay a fine of
1500.
O'Brien expects to eet a writ of habeas
corpus in the Supreme Court.
Tbe court remarked that if the workmen
continued their noise he would send them
to jail too.
THREE "STARS" DIMMED.
1 A Trio of Policemen Caught at a
Clandestine Kepnst Sus
pended. â¢ v :.*
. Three seductive plates of steaming,
wholesome beans and three small glasses
of amber lager proved the malign aeen
cies that cast desolation into the very
souls of three of San Francisco's finest
policemen late last Wednesday night.
Officers John Rainsbury, A. E. Holmes
and Dennis ' J. Daley went to work on
Wednesday evening at 6 o'clock, light
hearted and awake to duty. Unfortu
nately, however, the paths of the three
guardians of the peace crossed one an
other and at an unlucky moment about 11
o'clock, when all was silent," they met at
Bush and Montgomery streets.,:
All were, hungry and all were thirsty
and after a glance around the trio entered
the Forum saloon in quest of refreshments.
They were shortly seated at a table, their
coats unbuttoned and Kelts on the floor,
enjoying their clandestine meal. ; V ,- ' .
The hand of misfortune was hovering
over them, however, and '- just as all bad
assumed a position of absolute abandon,
Police Commissioner Mose Gunst and
Police Captain Wittman strolled into the
cafe for a cigar. 'â â¢
The surprise was mutual, but Captain
Wittman soon managed 10 pull his scat
tered thoughts together.
He eloquently, expostulated . with his
subordinates for their peculiar actions
and ordered the men to the station.
They went, of course, and Mr. Gunst
nodded approvalâ he was too benevolent
to give vent to his pent-up feelings by
word of mouth.
Yesterday Chief Crowley suspended the
three offending officers pending an inves
tigation by the Police Commissioners.
What excuse the officers will give for
eating beans between meals, however, re
mains locked in their minds.

Legal Separation From Her
Hunband.
It is now claimed that Mrs. Bessie Schep
pier, the bride of three days, has revealed
her presence in this City to certain sympa
thetic friends, as welt as being discovered
by detectives. She asserts still, according
to this claim, that she married Scheppler
because her mother insisted, and that she
will not return to him. Legal paprrs are
beine prepared, and public developments
may soon follow.
Mrs. Young is still of the opinion that
her daughter must have met with foul
play, because she herself ha* not been
notified by the missing girl where she is.
ON THE ANCIENT BKITONS.
Rev. W. I). Williams, DO., Lectures
Before the Geographical Society.
Rev. William D. Williams, D.D., lec
tured before the Geographical Society of
California on the "Ancient Britons; their
migrations and institutions," at Golden
Gate Hall, 625 Sutter street, fast evening.
The lecture was illustrated with stereop
ticon views.
As the lecturer told of the sturdy race
of men, after which one of the world's
greatest nations is named, pictured their
migrations and vast undertakings, and
spoke of their institutions, at that ancient
day marvelous in their magnitude, the
stereopticon would throw the outline of
the subject on a curtain located near the
Â«tage.
This feature of the lecture enabled the
audience to grasp the various points with
ease, and apparently augmented the in
terest of the audience, as each striking
picture was greeted with applause.
Tried to Commit Suicide.
William Newton, a laborer, aged 25 years,
shot himseU behind the right ear in Union
square Park shortly after midnight. He was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where it was
found that the bullet had shot away part of
his ear and lodged in his skull. The wound is
not considered fatal. Newton says he came
here from Chicago about two months ago. aud
being unable to find employment bought a
cheap revolver and used it accordingly.
May Sell I'VanchUea.
City and County Attorney Creswell, in re
sponse to an inquiry from the Board of Super
visors, has rendered an opinion that the
statutes of 1893, authorizing the sale of fran
chises in municipalities, is constitutional.
The board desires to know definitely as to (he
constitutionality of the act because of the ap
plication of the Market-street Railroad Com
pany tor a franchise over certaiu streets south
of the park.

BLYTHE'S FORTUNE
STILL IN COURT
Florence's f Rights to Be
Tested in Wash
ington.
A Claim That the Heiress Is an
Alien and Therefore With
out Standing.
Ht Attorneys Are Confident That the
Case Can Have No Standing
in Court.
â  General W. H. H. Hart has gone to
Washington to look after litigation affect
ing the Blythe estate. ~ .' â /â 
V The occasion of the attorney's visit is
the issuing of a writ of error by Justice
Field of the Supreme Court of the United
States upon the petition of the Kentucky
Blythes, represented by Attorneys Chand
ler and Holladay.
V It is believed that the action of the Chief
Justice v ill for some time stay the distri
bution of the estate, but the attorneys of
Florence Blythe-Hinckley say that the
writ will Boon be dismissed by the Su
preme Court. ...
Speaking of the matter yesterday, At
torney A. R. Cotton said: .
"The principal consideration is that H.
T. Blythe and John W. Blythe are r not
relatives of Thomas H. Blythe, and con
sequently are : not entitled to have any
voice in ' the distribution of Thomas H.
Blythe's ; estate. This fact has been de
termined by the courts of this State.
Upon the snowinc that the courts of Cali
fornia have so found, the United States
Supreme Court will not consider the mat
ter long. Not being relatives, these liti
gants have no more legal right to have a
voice concerning Thomas H. Blytbe's es
tate than any stranger or indifferent per
son might have."
The contention of Attorney Holiaday
is that Florence Blythe-Hinckiey is an
alien, having never been in the United
States until after the death of Thomas H.
Blythe. They contend 'â , that the courts
of California had no jurisdiction over the
matter because no treaty was ever made
by the United States giving Florence
Blytne-Hinckley the rights claimed. At
the proper time, it is said, James W.
Pearce will intervene as against Florence
Blythe-Hinckiey. the contention being
that thy Blytlie Company and the claim
ant are aliens and cannot proceed under
the laws of the United States. '
A EELIO OF EOYALTY.
It la Found in One of the Principal
diuretic* of New York.
Though few are aware of the fact mem
bers of the congregation of old St. Paul's
Church gaze every Sunday at the arms of
the future King of England. On the can
opy of the old-fashioned pulpit, which is
one of the pepper-box style of a century
ago, are the three ostrich feathers and the
crown that for many generations have
constituted the arms of the Prince of
Wales, the heir to Britain's throne. The
feathers stand out gracefully in the center
of the oak canopy. They are all carved
wood, handsomely gilded, and lorm an at
tractive ornamentntion to the pulpit.
With these royal arms over his head the
minister whoofficiates in St. Paul's Church
on Sunday reads the services of the Amer
ican church.
It is said that these royal arms
survived the storms of the Revolu
tionary days. An incensed mob traveled
through New York City when indepen
dence had been declared, destroying every
sign representing the monarchy from
whose cbains they had cut themselves
free. Nothing was regarded as beint
sacred by this mob.
The royal arms wero everywhere at that
time, on the windows of stores whose pro
prietors had been proud of this means of
reminding the public that at one time
they had supplied Ins Majesty's ships with
salt pork or Hardtack; on the lamp posts
at the street corner*, and swinging from
the front porches of the old inns. Win
dows on which the royal symbols ap
peared were ruthlessly smashed by the
mob, the Isidd posts were hurled to the
ground and the inns deprived of their
signs in short order.
It was a time when to be a client of
royalty brought a man into dangerous
prominence, and many wise storekeepers
escaped mob violence and saved the de
stroying party the trouble of smashing
their signs by doing the work themselves.
The royal nrms of England were hard to
find in New York City when the mob had
completed its tour. Some few signs es
caped the ruin, but not for long. They
were smashed as soon as attention was
called to their presence.
The relic in St. Paul's Church was passed
unnoticed, and has survived to this day.
It is certain that the mob somewhat
overlooked its existence, for no respect for
the sacredness of a church edifice would
have deterred it from laying the pulpit in
ruins had the presence ol the lent hers and
crown of Wales been pointed out. â New
York Times.
ANSONIA PLAGUED BY CROWS
Thousands of Bird* Keep Servom Citi-
ienÂ» Awake In the Karly Morning.
To the fact that mussels are unusually
plenty on the shore at Milford, sixteen
miles away, many Ansonia people at
tribute the ioss of a great deal nf sleep in
the early morning nowadays. Up at Kin
neytown dam, about a mile above An
sonia, on the road to Seymour, is a new
roosting place for crows, and it is no exag
geration to say that thousands of them
roost there every night. Judge George-B.
Clark of the Derby City Court had occa
sion to pass near there one night recently,
and be says they are so thick that the trees
were fairly black with them, and occasion
ally a limb would break off a tree because
of its great load.
Aboat 5 o'clock every morning the flock
awakeni, and for a few minutes the noise
is deafening. Then the. birds rise and (lv
southward to the shore of the sound at
Milford and Stratford, where they feed on
the mussels during the day. During their
flight over this city they keep up their con
stant "Caw! caw! caw!" and tired people
awaken and curse the crows, and finally
have to get up because the flock is so
large that it takes an hour or more ior it
to pass.
In the afternoon, about 4 o'clock, the
birds begin to return, but they come in
small flocks and fly higher, so that their
noise is less disturbing to nervous people.
Such large flocks were never seen here
abouts before, and it is said that their
presence is due to the fact that a wood on
Long Island wnere they have been wont
<o roost was burned recently, Â»nd they
have taken up new quarters. â New York
Sun.
In Berlin there are iron posts or stan
chions tixed in the curb at convenient dis
tances, marked "halting-place" for omni
bus or tram car. At these places the pas
sengers wait and the drivers are not al
lowed to pull up at any other spot. When
an omnibus approaches one of these posts
the conductor calls out, "Halting-place!"
and if a passenger wants to get out, or if
any passengers are watting to get in, the
driver pulls up; if not. he passes on.

JAMMED BETWEEN CARS.
Serious Accident to Superin
tendent Rudolph on the
Twelfth- Street Line.
While Trying to R place a Car the
Timber SiippeJ and He Was
Caujrbt
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 25. f
W. F. Rudolph, tho superintendent of
F. M. Smith's consolidated lines, was
caught between two cars to-night and
may die. The accident occurred in the
center of the city at Twelfth and Wash
ington street', and was witnessed by a
iarge crowd of people.
A car of the Twelfth-street line was off
the track and another car was being used
to help place it on the rails.
Mr. Rudolph was personally superin
tending the operation. To facilitate mat
ters, a piece of wood about four feet lone:
was being U3ed. It was placed in a posi
tion which it was anticipated would push
the car back on the track.
Rudolph stood between the cars, which
were just four feet apait, and gave the
order to back up. The carman at once
obeyed nis chief's order, bui the wood did
not hold and the two cars flew together
with the superintendent between.
He was jammed so severely that one
dashboard was broken. Tim cars recoiled
and Rudolph, still unconscious, was
picked up. Ho was carried to a drug
store and it was found that his left lee and
thigh were frightfully shattered. He also
received other internal injuries, the extent
of which cannot be yet ascertained.
"I am done for; take me home before I
die," exclaimed the sufferer as be was car
ried into the store. He was place 1 in the
patrol wanon and taken to his home.
There doctors attended Mr. Rudolph
and they staled at midnight that his life
need not be despaired of unless internal
injuries prove worse than present indica
tions lead them to believe.
HEART DISEASE.
New and Simple Treatment Advocated
in London.
This is an age of specialties, and in no
profession more than the medical one
does the specialist attain either fame or
profit, or a combination of ihe two. Every
day one hears of some doctor or some sur
geon who has made his name by the cure
of this or that disease, or by the perform
ance of this or that operation, but about
many of them, in London at least, some
thing more than a suspicion of quackery
hovers.
I beard the other day of some astonnd
ing cures due to an entirely new treat
ment of heart disease, which can hardly
be pasted by with the usual shrus of Che
shoulders which so often attends similar
details.
There is no doubt that among men of
our own generation, who are approaching
the age of 50, the most frequent form of
trouble, in this country at least, consists
in a weakened or otherwise abnormal ac
tion of the heart It in this state of thine?
which Dr. Thomeâ the specialist in ques
tion â undertakes absolutely to cure, unless
it be accompanied by some precise valvular
disease. His treatment is simplicity itself.
It consists merely in the employment by
the patient every day of some peculiar
motions of the arms which are calculated
to bring into activity certain sluggish
portions of the circulation. Accompany
| ing these physical exercises, baths are
given of hot water strongly impregnated
with certain salts and cbalybeates.
One of the most successful cures has
been that of Lord Spencer, vbo not lone
ai;o was a hopeless invalid, but who now
rides daily to hounds and has resumed bis
place as master of the hunt. Lord Mount-
Edeecumbe also was told by two of the
leading London phy*ici .ns, when he in
sisted on having a definite answer to his
j question, that he had better put his bouse
in order at once, as they could not defi
nitely grant him more than two months
of life. After a few weeks of the new ,
treatment be found himself in practically 1
perfect health, and has since re-J
mained in that pleasurable condition^^,
A special ward in one of the London
hospitals has been set apart for poor
patients suffering from heart disease, to
be operated upon after this method, and
demonstrations of it are given to medkal
men throughout the country by Dr.
Thome. The merit of the discovery, how
ever, rests, as is so often the case in these
matters, with a German professor. â Lon
