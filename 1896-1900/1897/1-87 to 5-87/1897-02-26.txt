WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 28.â "With an apparent disregard of whether the
appropriation bilU still unacted on by the Senate are to be passed at the pres
ent session or are to be relegated to the House In extra session, the Senate to
ay by a vote of Â£O to 27 laid aiide the Indian appropriation bill, which had
already occupied three days, and took up the joint resolution which had been
reported yesterday from the Committee on Foreign Relations for the immediate
and unconditional release of Julio Sanguilly from a Cuban fortress. It came
up in the first initancs as part of the morning business, the Vice-President
deciding that under the rule a motion to take up-the Indian bill was not in or
der until after the morning business w.Â«s disposed of, and when, at 1 P. M., the
morning hour did expire a motion to proceed with the Sanguilly joint resolu
tion wan made by Allen (Top.) of Nebraska, and although it was resisted by the
chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, Alii -on, and was voted against
by the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, Sherman, it prevailed
by the vote mentioned. The debate from the first was of a rather exciting char
acter Allen spoke of Spain as "a decaying monarchy, a blot on the map of the
world and a disgrace to civilization. "
Daniel (D.) of Virginia said that Sangutlly had been treated "rigorously,

DETAILS UF TIIE DEHATE.
Senator! Prote.it .4t/nin*t the ShoeKimj
Crueltim in Cuba,
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. '25.â When
the Senate met at 11 o'clock thi3 morning
there were lew present, but work was at
once got by dispensing with the reading
of yesterday's journal.
An effort was made by Hoar (R.) of
Massachusetts to have an hour fixed for
taking the vote on the bankruptcy bill, but
objection was made by Jones (D.) of Ar
kansas.
The Vice-President laid before the Sen
ate the resolution offered yesterday by
AJlen(P.) of Nebraska in regard to the
ill-treatment of American citizens in
Cuba.
Allen proceeded to speak upon his reso
â¢ lution. The story, he said, was a long
one and was full of atrocious barbarities.
One of these was the searching of an
i American lady in a public manner and
I nder circumstances of extreme cruelty.
â  Another infamous act was the eathering
[i at little giris in the island of Cuba by
the military authorities and selling them
into the worst species of slavery â selling
tht-m for lives of shame. It had been re
ported. A!!en said, that ir>fa;its had been
taken by the heels an ; hacked to piece*
by Spanish soldiers in the presence of
their f&tl.ers anJ mothers, who were then
mas acreii. In conclusion, he denounced
Spain as "a decaying monarchy, a blot
on the map of the world and a disgrace to
civilization "
MorÃan (D ) of Alabama spoke on the
â¢ joint resolution reported by him yester
uay from the Committee on Foreign Re
lations in reference to the case of Julio
Sanguiliy, whom he described as a regu
iarly naturalized cit'zen of the United
states, who had got out his naturalization
p ipers an 1 brought them to Cuba in 1878,
where they were registered in tlie Ameri
can Consulate and where he had resided
ever since. Saneuilly had taken port in
the laM Cuban revolution where he had
i'eeu grievously wounded, but had always
denieu any complicity in the present revo
luiicn. Morgan made a statement of the
facts and circumstances connected with
arregt, imprisonment and
trial.
At the close of Morgan's remarks Allen
*i consented to have his own resolution re
(lerred to the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions with the assuiance from Morgan
that it would be promptly considered and
acted upon. '
The joint resolution as to Sanguiliy ob
tained precedence, and the consideration
of it was continued.
Daniel (D.) of Virginia, a member of
the Committee on Foreign Relation-, went
over the story of the case, notwithstand
ing what he termed "the admirable and
The San Francisco Call
clear statement 1 ' made by the Senator
from Alabama. Daniel said that San
euilly had been treated in a manner that
was a disgrace to this century and civili
zation. Not only that, but the American
Consul had been treated arrogantly by the
Spanish authorities â not only in his own
person, but in his country. He had been
told by a Spanish officer high in authoi ltv,
to whom he had made a most polite and
courteous appeal, that his conduct in pre
senting an intervention in favor of San-
KUiJly by order of the State Department
was a disgrace to the United States and to
the American fl:i;r.
"If that Consul," Daniel declared, "had
demanded his passports, and if the Span
ish Governrm nt had failed to apologize
for that insult to our representative and
to our flag, and an American fleet had
been sent to Havana to dernar.d it, 1 do
not believe there is a sinple citizen of the
United States who would not have re
joiced at it."
"I hope," said Hale, "that before the
discussion ends (and it will not end in
one or two hours or in one or two days),
the Committee on Foreign Relations will
put the Senate in possession of what the
State Department is doing in the way of
release of Sunguily, if that be the object
of the joint resolution."
Dinielâ The rttate Department has boen
dealing with this matter, diplomatically,
two years, and two years is iong enough
for this Government to get a United States
citizen out of prison.
"I am unwilling," Daniel declared, in
dignantly, "that an American citizen
illegally detained, shall be subj cled to
any conditions. It is a humiliation to
this country to submit to any conditions
when the power oi any other Government
is exercised unlawfully. If I represented
thia country in any place in which I could
act witli authority, 1 would telegraph
Sanguiliy not to withdraw bis appeal, but
to stand on his rights as an American citi
zen, and that there was enough people in
this country who respect their rights to
see that he was no longer dotained in a
Spanish fortress."
Here Hale read a telegraphic dispatch
of this date from Havana itatinjc thai
counsel for Sanguiliy had tied papers
withdrawing his appeal. "So," Hale com
mented, "(he appeal is withdrawn ana
Sanguiliy stands ready to be pardoned."
At this point Frye (R. ) of Maine, also a
member of the Committee on Foreign Re-,
lations, broke into tne discussion with
the impetuous declaration that if San
guiliy's counsel had done that he had
done an exceedingly wicted and unjust
act toward bit client.
"How does the Senator know that?"
Hale asked.
"I know it from this," Frye answered.
"This man Sanguiliy has bees convicted
SAINT FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 26, 1897.
SULZER DECLARES WAR ON SPAIN.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 25.-Sulzer (D.) of New York offered
in the House to-day a bill declaring war between the "Kingdom of
Spain and her colonies and the United States of America and her
territories." The measure reads as follows: "That war be declared
to exist between the Kingdom of Spain and her colonies and the
United States of America and her territories, and the President is
authorized to use the whole land and naval force of the United States
to carry the same into effect, and to issue to private armed vessels a
United States commission or letters of marque and general reprisal
in such form as he may think proper and under the seal of the United
States against the vessels, goods and effects of the Government of the
said Kingdom of Spain and the subjects thereof."
The measure was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

of a crime, the punishment of which is
imprisonment for life. He has entered
an appeal to Madrid. If that appeal is
withdrawn it is a confession of the crime,
and judgment follows, and he can on.y
escape by a pardon. He loses for himÂ«elf
and for his family all the claims for dam
ages against Spain. That is what Spain
is contendine for. We contend that Ihe
man has been unjustly convicted; that
he has been treate i against international
law and that Spain mu3t deliver him up
to us. And if 1 had my way," Frye ex
claimed dramatically, "a ship of war
would start at once for Havana."
Applause broke out in the galleries, and
was kept up for some time in spile of the
effort of the Vice-President to suppress it.
Hale â My colleague has told the story.
It is not a <ie-i:e to have tois man re
leased which is at the bottom of the mat
ter. What they want is war. Tiiat is
what the Senator wants. I tell the Sen
ator and the rest of the Senators that this
country will not be driven to war in the
next seven nays â not if I can help it.
Hoar (11.) of Massachusetts questioned
the citizenship of Sanguilly and . referred
to conflicting statements oa the subject in
the committee's report.
Daniel replied that he did not feel called
upon to go behind the action oJ the Slate
Department in recogniz ng ihe citizen?hin
of Sanguiliy.
Vilas(D.)of Wisconsin referred to the
fact that San^uiily had sorvel in the Cu
ban insurrection from 1863 to 1878 and
that his naturalization papers bore date
of 1878, so that he could not possibly have
complied with the law requiring hve
years' residence.
Hoar quoted the Revised Statutes and
said it was clear that Sanguilly's naturali
zation papers were fraudulent. There was
no decent pretense to the contrary.
Teller (Silver) of Colorado, declared that
nobody, not even the State Department,
had a rignt to go beyond the record. He
spoke of the conduct of the State Depart
ment as "pusillanimous," and said he ex
pected nothing better from the next ad
ministration. But he prayed and hoped
that the Republican party when it got into
power might nave a little of its old fire
and spirit He agreed with the Senator
from Maine (Frye) who said that he would
send a ship to Havana.
"Mr. President!" he exclaimed, "I
would send every ship we have got. I
would not count dollars by the side of
American manhood. I would make every
power in the world respect American citi
zenship, if it should take all the money
and all ihe ships and all the men that we
have got to do it."
Wlien Teller finished his remarks Allen
(Pop.) of Nebraska alluded to tne fact
that the discussion had been going on lor
the last hour on the Indian bill, and he
moved that that bill be laid aside and that
the Sanguiliy resolution be again taken
np. The motion was agreed to â ayes 40,
noes 27, as follows:
Ayeo â Allen, Bacon, Berry, Blackburn,
Blanchard, Br^wn, Butler, Call, Cameron,
Cannon, Carter, Chandler, Daniel, Davis.

Platt, Praetor, Pujrh, Quay, Seweli, Sher
man and Wet more â 28.
So the Sanguilly joint resolution was
again taken up formally.
White (D.) of California addressed the
Senate. The action of the Senate to-day,
he said, demonstrated that v was not its
purpose to engage in the business of con
sidering the appropriation bills, but
would consider a joint resolution which
could not possibly pass, or which if passed
could not be effective as it would not re
ceive executive approval.
Hale (R.) of Maine, said that Senators
micht as well understand that if tnis
question were kept before the Senate it
would be fully debited and would sub
stantially confiscate every hour of the ses
sion, leaving many appropriation bills un
passed.
Hili (D.) of New York said that the
premier of the next administration (Sher
man) had reported the resolution yester
day, or had agreed to its being reported,
and he expressed the hope that the Sen
ate would tr.ke it up to-day and pass it.
"I hear it whispered in the rear," Hill
playfully remarked, "that he then voted
against its consideration to-day." [Laugh
ter.] "But lam not going to maice that
statement. If the Senate pass this joint
resolution it may have some moral effect
upon the next administration."
"I differ from the Senator from New
York," said White, "and I hope that the
chairman of the Committee on Foreicn
Relations will not be forced to carry into
his policy as Secretary of State views
which he has announced in the resolu
tion."
Mr. Hillâ Why should he not be con
sistent?
"It is within bis power," said White,
pleasantly, "to u*e his own judgment
whether he is to be or not to be consistent
[laughter], and I shall not attempt to
trench upon it or to step within that
sacred circle."
These playful allusions impelled Mr.
Sherman to defend himself. He said:
"Ihe Senator from California seems to
drag me into debate, although I do not
care to enter upon it. I am in favor
cf the joint resolution and I think it
ought. ;o command the unanimous ap
proval of the Senate. I believe that a
cross injustice has been dove to a citizen
ot the United States who has a right to
jsrotection from the President. I am not
in favor of pressing this resolution at this
moment, but it stands in the way of ap
propriation bills, and I have so voted and
will vote again. I trust that after the
debate has gone on awhile the Sen
ate will see the necessity of tak
ing up the appropriation bills and
Datsinu them. I do not think there is
any inconsistency in mat. I hope that
Senators wno are opposed to the resolu
tion will not stand in cbe way of a vote.
It is a great injustice to say that we who
are in favor of the resolution are opposed
to the passage of the resolution. I trust
the time will never come when an Ameri
can citizen can be wronged or persecuted
by any power, great or small. That is the
way I feel now. lam in favor of protect
ing this American citizen, though he may
not be a naturalized citizen. I am op
posed to wr. ng and violence and tyranny,
wherever it is exercised, and when it is
exercised against an American citizen I
will itand up for him, even if I am
alone."
White â Of course, we are all opposed to
wrong and, of course, we are in favor of
protecting American citizens. Ttiis ques
tion can be dealt with by the Senator from
Ohio in ten days from now in less time
than it can be dealt with now.
The rest of the speech was an elaborate
argument for the recognition ot a new
Governrue.it.

A POSTOFFICE
FOR THIS CITY
IS DEMANDED.
Commercial Bodies Ask Why-
San Francisco Has Been
Slighted*
LEGISLATORS JOIN IN THE CRY.
Prominent Citizens Will Locate the Responsi
bility for Delay and Make a Vigorous
Demand for Justice for the
People
"The Call" has been showered with compliments for its bold
stand in favor of urging those in charge of the matter to hasten the
construction of the new Postoffice. It is the general belief of business
men and the masses who stop to consider the matter that the delay in
starting the work of building the great Federal structure is a disgrace.
The general opinion on all hands is that the citizens of San
Francisco ought to be furnished with specific reasons why the
apparently inexcusable delay has occurred. The people have been
put off with one flimsy excuse and another, year after year, until talk
of a new postoffice here is in the nature of a chronic joke. In spite of
all the excuses and delays made other cities, many of them very small
ones, have obtained their appropriations and had their buildings
completed since the talk of building here began.
The hour has arrived when this City ought to arouse from its
lethargy. Patience is no longer good policy or good warfare. We
need an organized and an aggressive movement "toward the base
of the pyramids," as old Tom Benton used to say 4 a strong, incessant
and manly demand for justice. It is not a plea for a gift, not a special
request for a privilege that is needed, but a vigorous, and if need be,
spirited and belligerent demand for rights long overdue.
Appeals ftom this City have heretofore been like talking to a
cyclone, but the hour has now come when the representative men and
business organizations of San Francisco have decided to learn just why
these unwarranted delays have occurred.
The Chamber of Commerce has made several strong and patriotic
appeals on this matter in the past, but its demands have gone unheeded.
Petitions to the mysterious power behind the supervising architect's
throne have not been heard. That deaf personage seems to sit as
Phillips said of Napoleon, "wrapped in the solitude ot his own original
ity." He heeds nothing, does nothing and says nothing of any conse
quence. Year after year the same dull, cold ear of the sphinx at
Washington is turned to the anxious waiters and watchers of San Fran
cisco â nothing more. Other postoffices rise, but here delay drags on
without interruption or hope of abatement.
The five principal commercial and industrial organizations of the
City have decided to hold a conference to-day, with a view of taking
immediate and decisive action to learn the cause for the delay in build
ing the new Postoffice. They purpose to go at the matter in a sys
tematic business-like way, and try to locate the blame in a definite
manner. Having done this, the object is to "pound on that one string,"
as Emerson puts it, until the harp gives forth a vibration of certain
sound. If the supervising architect has pigeonholed the plans and
tangled the project with red tape he will be reported and, if necessary,
investigated, with a view of being reprimanded or removed from his
position.
The conduct of the sluggish Democratic administration, aside from
what the Congressional delegation from California has done in the
matter of the Postoffice, has been shameful. In spite of the fact that
the site has been thoroughly tested and approved by local army en
gineers, delays have been attributed to the mysteries of the site when
ever such a spook of an excuse suited the Supervising Architect.
Weary of giving such an excuse, he has at times pretended that the
department was greatly aggrieved over anonymous letters from San
Francisco stating that the site was a bog. Again driven to bay, the
architects have occasionally pleaded rush of business in other parts of
the country, forever putting San Francisco in the attitude of a hungry
mendicant. But the metropolis of the Golden West is about to declare
itself as it has seldom done. The City is weary of receiving "not-at
home" replies to its demands upon its debtor, the Federal Government.
The City's princely contribution to the general revenues is sufficient to
entitle it to stand as a master in this matter, so that those who
deny it justice will feel the lash on their backs. The authors of the
passive policy that has so long inconvenienced the masses have gone
unvvhipped by justice long enough. The hour of retribution is at
hand, and the administration is sure to find such a stir that the just
complaint of the people here cannot be longer pooh-poohed and pushed
aside with impunity.
The entire Union does not afford another such example of neglect
as the Federal Government has been guilty of in the matter of the San
Francisco Postoffice. What is San Francisco that it should be thus
slighted and forever elbowed off into the indefinite future ? Compara
tively few cities surpass it in population and Federal business. Why
should it be slighted and put in a worse position than small towns on
the Missouri River ? The time for action has arrived, and the people
realize that the hour for the battle has come.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 25.â Had it

situation in reference to the proposed new
Federal building and Pcstoffice in San
Francisco, trat appeared in tit is morning's
issue of The Call, attracted general at
tention among the members of both
branches, and induced Senator Wolfe of
San Francisco to offer the following joint
resolution:
Whereas, There has been inexplicable and
apparently inexcusable delay on the part of
the Federal authorities at Washington, D. U.,
in ordering the commencement of work on
the Postoffice building to be constructed on
the site already purchased at the northeast
corner of Seventh and Mission streets, San
Francisco, and for which there is now $'210,
---000 available for immediate use in the treas
ury of the United States; and whereas, there
is a large number of unemployed men In San
Francisco who hare gathered there from2
aU parts of the St-ite and who are
anxious and clamoring for an opportunity to
earn a living by hottest toil, and who would
be afforded the oppoitunity they desire if this
work were begun at once; and, whereas, the
construction of a new Postoffice at San Fran
cisco is a necessity demanded not only by the
commercial needs of that City and the entire
State, but wiil be a boon to every section
whose mail must pass through that City;
therefore, be it
Resolved, By the Senate, the Assembly con
curring. That our Senators in Congress be in
structed, and our Representatives therein be
requested and urged to take such action as
will cause the proper authorises at Washing
ton, D. C, to issue the necessary orders to
have the work of constructing the San Fran
cisco Postoffice bui. cling begun forthwith, and
be it further
Eetolvcd. That a copy ol tnese resolutions be
forwarded to said Senators and Represeuia
tives in Congress by tht; Secretary of the
Senate.
President pro tern. Flint was in the
chair, and ruled that such a resolution
took the same course as a bill and was out
of order, as it was in contravention of
joint rule 48, which reads in part as fol
lows:
"No bills shall be introduced in either
the Senate or the Assembly after the
fiftieth day of t':e session, excepting rev
enue measures."
Senator Wolfe protested against the
enforcement of this rule, declaring
that it was a violation of constitu
tional rights, as the constitution of
the State provided simply that no
bills shall bo introduced after the fiftieth
day of the session of the Legislature, ex
c?pt by consent of two-tmrds of the mem
bers, without rec.ird to what the characttr
of the bill i-. He then argued as follows:
'iThis is a measure that affects San
Francisco and the people of the Â£:ate at
large. Wo know that the authorities at
Washington have raaiie preparations for
the erection of a Postoffice and Fedeial
balding in San Francisco. We know
that for years the matter has bÂ«en pend
ing in Congress, but for some reason or
other, which hus never beeu explained,
no action for the actual construction of
the building has ever been taken.
"San Francisco is one of the most im
portant seaports of the country, and in
the past fourteen years has ccntributed
more than $100,000,000 to the treasury of
the United States in tne form of customs
Unties alone. Notwithstanding this fact
she has got a Federal building that would
be a disgrace to a city of one-tenth it*
size.
"I take it for granted that the rule
which has been cited against me was
meda a part of the joint rules inad
vertently, as there can be no question
about its contravening the constitution of
the State and the constitutional rights of
the members of the Legislature. 1 don't
think the members wish to tie their
hands by any such rnle, and I submit
that this matter is of too much import
ance to be thrown aside, as it will be if
the decision of tne chair stands.
"'Another thing to be taken into consid
eration is the fact that there are larce
numbers of unemployed in San Francisco
v;:.o are drawn there during the winter
period from all parts of the State, and this
matter concerns them in that if the Wash
ington authorities can be prevailed upon
to order construction work on this build
ing to begin at once an opportunity lor
work will be afforded tÂ£ese men. The ob
ject of the resolution which I desire to
have considered and adopted by the
Senate is to induce our Senators and Rej
resentatives in Congress to bring about
such action on the part oi the responsible
(iticialsat Washington as will start this
work at once."
Senators Stratton, Braunhart and Dick
inson came to the assistance of Senator
Wolfe, but without avail. The chair held
firmly to hia ruling and said that as long
as the rule stood he felt it his duty to en
force it. He added tiiat he had no per
sonal feeiin<r in the matter and that the
only remedy was to abolish the rule. A
conference committee from both houses
has been appointed to consider the aboli
tion of this rule and will make its report
tc-morrow, which will undoubtedly be in
favor of striking out this rule.
The resolution was returned to Senator
Wolle ana will be reintroduced by him to
morrow as soon as the report of the con
ference committee is adopted.
A-sembiyman Dibble will introduce the
same resolution in the Assembly tomor
row.
In conversation with Senators from all
â sections of the State, it was learned to
aight-that the resolution has their hearty
indorsement and will receive their sup
port on the floor and also their votes.
Among ihose who were particularly
â trong in their expressions in favor of the
resolution and the ideas embodied therm
were: Senators Buila of Los Angeles.
S:rattoii of Alsmeda, Smith of Kern and
Mahoney an i Braunhart of San Fran
cesco. The matter is not looked upon as
one of local importance to San Francisco,
but as one that affects the standing and
welfare of the entire State.

The matter of the new Postoffice for San

started as quickly as possible.
Juiian Sonntag took the initiative yes
terday and hesent out the following letter
to A. A. Wat kins, W T . F. Dohrmann,
Hugh Craig and General N. P. Chipman,
the presidents of the organizations men
tioned:
fAN Francisco, February 25, 1897.
Lear Sir: The matter of the new I'osti.fiice
for San Francisco is largely claiming the at
tention of our citizens. No doubt belore our
representatives leave Washington an effort
should be made.
You are invited to raeei with the presidents
or tUo Board of Trade> of San Francisco, the
Merchants' Association, the State Board of
Trade and the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association at the rooms of thp last named at
1 :30 p. m. Friday, February 26, for the purpose
of devism? some plan to carry out this object.
Yours very truly, Julian sonntag.
As General Chipmun of the State Board
of Trade is now at his home at Red iiiuff,
Mr. Sonntag tent to htm a telegram ask
ing him to come down to this City to-day.
J. A. Filcher, manager of the State Board
of Trade, stated that General Chipman in-
I tended to come to San Francisco soon
upon other business, and that no doubt
the dispatch would hasten him on his
way.
'l'Â£be reason forgetting the several presi
dents together at once is apparent," said
Mr. Sonntag. "The time that our Pacific
Coast representatives will remain at Wash
ington is uncertain, as they may leave tne
capital immediately upon the adjourn
ment in Congress. We want to Ret the
matter in shape before they scatter, so
they may present it at Washington and
; uÂ«e all their power to get the work
j started.
"The immediate plan is to bring these
I presidents togeher and outline a ecneral
plan for assembling their respective bodies
in a big convention. Ido not believe that
the people at Washington would disregard
a petition coming from such a source and
< making such a request. A general meet
ing, 1 believe, could be held in the Chum
! ber ot Commerce hall, and in a short time
much could be accomplished. Now in tne
; time to get the work on the Postoffioa
j started, and if the pubhc demand it I
think that their demand wiJl not be dis
regarded."
The mem hers of the Merchants' Associa-
I tion have alwajs b*n at the front in every
' movement for the benefit of tne public,
and the body will no doubt be represented
at the conference to-day. However, b*
j fore takinc definite action President Dour-
Vamos, Near Suda Bay. At This Point the Turkish Troops Were Defeated by the Insurgents Last June.
I mann will endeavor to secure more
! information than he has upon the subject.
Tj this end the association yesterday sent
dispatches to Congressmen James G. Ma
guire and Eugene F. Loud. The one to
Mr. Loud read as follows:
San Francisco. February 25, 18D7.
To Hon. Eugene P. Loud, House of Jiepresenta

| reasons lor delaying early construction of new
Postoffice. Merchants' Association.
IRISH HAS HIS SAY.
The Naval Officer Tells Why There
Is Delay.
United States Naval Officer John P.
Irish of the port of San Francisco de
clares that the people of this City are
entirely responsible for the delay in stnrt
ingthenew Postoffice building. He ex plains
why the site was chosen; asserts that
Us desirability Is not in question in Wash
ington, and offers some suggestions for
the California delegation calculated to
insure speedy operations upon tne foun
dations for the build in?. He said yes
terday:
"The proposed Federal building; for this
City is not primarily for Postoffice pur
poses. The choicu of a location for it de
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1897.
pended upon the various uses to which the
building is to be put.
"An act of Congress passed in iBB7 re
quired the purchase of a site suitable for
Postoffice. courtrooms and other Federal
offices in the City of San Francisco. The
entire third floor is for the Federal
courts. The whole second floor is for the
offices of the Surveyor-General, the Regis
ter and the Receiver of the Land Office,
the Pension Surgeon, the navy pay office,
the Pension Agent's office, and all other
Federal offices in San Francisco not con
nected immediately with the Revenue
Department.
"Under the new system of distribution
of mails and the use of s'.reet railway lines
for that purpose it will come to pass that
tne least use of the new building will be
for Postolfice service and the greatest use
Jor other Federal offices.
"At first only $350,00 ) was appropriated
for the purchase of a site. This was found
inadequate and then $SOO,OOO was appro
priated. Finally that was increased a-ain
to the sum of $1,250,000. Then in 1892 the
present site, at Seventh and -Mission
streets, was bought. It was the largest
and cheapest sieht offered. We reported
on 81l the properties offered that came
within the instructions. There were seven
teen in all. We simply described them
each by their dimensions, the price asked
a square foot, and located them on a City
map already in possession of the Congres
sional committee showing the surface,
transportation, the car lines of the City
and the ceuters of trade. The choree of
the site rested with the Congressional
committee and by it was made. But the
President of the United fc-'tat^s, tne Na
tional architect and the Assistant Secre
tary of the Treasury had all seen the
property.
"Because of the courtrooms to be in the
new building it was not desirable to locate
it on Market street, on account of the
noise. It was thought best to have it con
venient to but not ironting on that street.
"The old building now occupied bj* the
7-iostoffice and the so-called appraisers'
building will be given up to the Custom
house and Internal ilevenue offices as soon
as the new bunding shall have been com
pleted.
"My advice is for our commercial and
other public bodie3 and the press of San
Francisco that desire to bring influence 10
bear for the prompt beginning of this
work to proceed not along lines of accusa
tion and fault-finding.
'â¢The only lault in the whole matter
heretolore hag been in San Francisco, not
in Washington. It would be well to ac
cept this fact and to urge theconsumma-
tion of the project along other lines than
accusation.
"There has never been any unfavorable
report about the proun I. Professor David
son and Colonel liendell made tbenrst
borings and the committee of military en
gineer? made the second. Wh u n Mr.
Crouch, the Assi-tant Fecretnry of the
Treasury, wes out here, lie went with me
to the site and we saw the boring test*.
There Is underlying this whole peninsula
a black stratum of hard adobe mixed with
sand and in it are signs of a prehistoric
vegetation, but it is the hardest thing the
drill strites except rock iiself. When we
were there ihe drill brought up some of
that black stuff, and Mr. Crouch and 1
took samples of it. The next day the
newspaper accounts styled it a foul
smeliing bog.
"Mr. Crouch remarked upon the evident
untrutbfuiuess of these assertion", and
together we put our sample in the grate to
?ee if it was peat, for then it would burn.
It. did burn, but it was into a hard hrirk,
and we sent the specimen on to Wash
ington.
"The first thing that is necessary to the
construction of the new building is, in my
judgment, for Congress to pase an act in
creasing the avjtilabl :ipprjpnation. Ii
is not a wise poJicy to start a several mi:
lion dollar building on a few hundred
thousand dollars available money. It is
poor economy 10 work by little bits and
cause expensive delays whilo waiting for
further appropriation.
"Our delegation j n Congress should
woik for an increase of the available u\>
propriadon. Congress ought to appro
priate about $250,000 now instead of some
time later, and that together with the
$210,000 at present available would be a
si.iticient sum to procoea with and pro
ceed economically. The money has to
come sometime, and nothing is gained by
issuing it in comparatively small sums.
"If this be done under the new admin
istration everything ou^ht to be reÂ«dy by
the Ist ot July for excavation to basin.
Then the Secretary oi the Treasury will,
I feel, bo ready to go ahead provided some
San Francisco 'newspaper does not again
insist thai the site is a bog.
"I received a letter to-dny from the edi
tor of the American Architect in which he
says that the plan lor the Kan Francisco
Federal building was submitted to a num
ber of Eastern architects of eminence and
was very highly approved by all of them.
This is contrary to the report that has
been given out here."
Procrastination Not Right.
Registrar Hlnionâ The delay in the
Postoflice matter indicates great neeiect.
The loss of interest on the investment is
one inducement :o do something. If the
Postottice will evsr be a (rood thing it will
b# a. soort thing now. Procrastination is
now the thief of money. Tne interest on
the investment for eight years is >> large
sum.
GREAT BRITAIN
THREATENS FORCE
Salisbury Outlines Her Ulti
matum in the House
of Lords.
Turkey or Greece May Be Coerced
by the Combined Powers
at Crete.
It D' minds That CrMe Ought to R â¢
main as a Portion of the
Turkish Empire.
LONDON, Exg , Feb. 25.â There was a
iai(:e atienaance of peers and visitors at
the opening of tne sitting of the House of
Lords this evening. Several peeresses
were present and a number of bishops
other than those entitled to sit in the
House of Lords, together with some mem
bers of the House of CommonÃ, looked, on
from the galleries.
Soon after the House came to order
Lord Dunraven arose and made a formal
request that the Government inform the
House as to the exact situation in Crete
and the Government's negotiations with
ihe powers looking to a settlement of the
difficulties.
Lord Salisbury, upon rising to reply,
was tremendously cheered, and when the
cheering hud subsided he said that a te:e
grain had been sent to the British repre
sentative at the capital of eaci of the
com b:ued European powers, the phrase
ology of which was as follows:
Inform the Government to which you are
accredited that her Majesty's Government
proposes to make the following declaration of
t.^.e policy it intends to pursue, which it be
lieves to be in accordance with that of its
allies:
Urstâ That the establishment of administra
tive autonomy in Crete is necessary to the
termlnatiou of international occupation of
thai island.
Second â That, subject to such system of ad
ministrative autonomy, Crete ought to re
main a portion of the Turkish Empire.
Thirdâ That tho Governments of Turkey and
Greece ought to be informed of this resolution.
Fourthâ That if either Turkey or Greece
should persist in a refusal when required to
withdraw her naval and military forces from
tne island the powers should impose their de
cision by force.
Lord Salisbury said it did not follow
that the Turkish troops would be with
drawn from Crete immediately. Never
theless the practical withdrawal of her
troops from the Island was a necessary
condition to the establishment of auton
omy, and they would therefore be with
drawn.
The Premier then gave as instances of
autonomous adminimrations the form of
government which now obtains in the
island of Samos, a Turkish possession,
and which formerly prevailed in Servia,
and proceeded lo say he imagined
that ihe powers would require the
Greek troops in Crete to ba with
drawn at an earlier date than the
Tuikisb troops, but he was unable to give
any further details until he knew what
decision had been reached by the powers.
StilJ, it was his belief that the powers rec
ognized the principles he had announced
as Intimating their policy.
Lord Kimberly, who was Minister of
Foreign Affairs in the Cabinet of Lord
Rosebery, said that the statement just
made by Lord Salisbury was one of great
gravity and would require careful con
sideration on his part before he felt pre
pared to make any observations thereon.
The House then adjourned.
The whole incident occupied twenty
minutes. Subsequently the Earl of Kim
berly held a conference with Sir William
Harcourt in a private room.
In the Bouse of Commons the floor and
galleries were crowded with members and
spectators. Shortly after the speaker had
.aken his seat Right Hon. A. J. Balfour,
First Lord of the Treasury and the
Government leader in the House of Com
mons, made a statement similar to the
one made by Lord Salisbury in the House
of Lords, at the conclusion of which Sir
William Harcourt, the leader of the oppo
sition, said that the statement concerning
the Cretnn situation and the methods to
be employed in its settlement, which Had
just been laid before the House, were of
tne gravest character.
It affected the present and future rela
tions of Great Britain with the powers of
Europe, Decides Turkey and Greece, and
its gravity was especially shown in its
last paragraph relating to the employ
ment of force in the even: of the persist
ent refusal of Turkey or Greece to comply
with tiie demands of the powers. He re
quested the Government to fix an early
dale for debating tne matter.
'1 lie Creian situation was about the only
topic of conversation in the lobby of ths
House. The Conservatives, as in duty
bound, upheld the Government's scheme,
but many of the Liberals declared that
Lord Salisbury's proposal would not have
the effect of settling the trouble.
They held that Greece would resist tht
pressure brought against her, or if she did
not half of the Greek army of occupation
now in Crete would desert and join the
insurgents in their warfare against the
Moslems. The insurrection would soon
spread to the mainland, and, in a short
time, tne whole of Macedonia would be
aflame against the Turks.
Francis S. Stevenson, M. P. and chair
man of tne Anglo-Armenian Association,
declared that he believed such a result
would follow the adoption of Lord Salis
bury's proposals and said tha; in so de
claring he voiced the opinion of the Right
Hon. James Bryca, an ex-Liberal Minister
and a well-known writer on international
subjects.
CAMiOT KECaLL <iUJSEK TROOPS.
King George and. Cabinet W-ll Continue
to Attlirrn to Jheir Policy.
LONDON, Esq., Feb. 25.â An Athens
dispatch to the Central News says that
King George and his Cabinet proclaim
their resolution to maintain their present
policy. They declare that it is impossible
for them to recall the Greek troops from
Crete.
The Athens correspondent of the Stand
ard â¢ tele raphs that it is reported that
Colonel Smolentz, Minister of War, has
renewed his offer to resign. There are
signs that the remainder of the Cabinet
are inclined to take a similar step, but any
indication ot retiring from the King's
policy would involve the greatest danger
to the throne.
It is therefore unlikely that there will
he any faltering in fhe highest quarters.
There is doubtless a grim popular deter
mination to follow the sacrifices already
made to the bitter end. An expression of
the exasperation felt a*, the altitude of
the powers was given to-day when 300
volunteers, who had been prevented by
the warships from landing in Crete,
marched through the streets accompanied
by military bands.
It is understood that the note of the
powers arrived to-day and that it will be
presented to the Government to-morrow.
TnÂ« reply will probably dictated by the
resolution of the Greeks to yield only to
superior force.
The blockade of Crete is now being
strictly maintained. The scarcity of pro
visions is beginning to be felt. The foreign
admirals have stopped ali communication
between the Greek warships and Colonel
Vassos, the commander of the Greek
army of occupation. A Greek gunboat
has undertaken to convey communica
tions from Colonel Vassos to Athens.

yielded to Allison, chairman of the Com
mittee on Appropriations, who proposed
that a recess should be taken from 6 to 8
p. m., and that the Indian appropriation
bill shall then be taken up.
Hill objected to the latter clause of the
proposition, remarking that it would be
better to finish up the Cuban matter.
Allison felt it necessary to yield and
rather regretfully withdrew the sugg?s
tion as to the appropriation biil.
The House bill to amend the act as to
the appointment of receivers of National
banks was taken from the calendar and
passed without amendment; also the
House bill to better define and regulate
the rights of aliens to hold and own real
estate in the Territories jfjalso the House
bill concerning the delivery of letters in
towns and villages, allowing delivery to
be made by letter-carriers to associations
of not less than twenty persons, and at
their expense.
At 6 o'clock the recess was declared.
The expected continuation of the Cuban
storm did not appear when the Senate
met after the short recess to-night. By
common consent biils were passed to al
low the bottling of distilled spirits in bond
and to prevent the importing of impure
and unwholesome tea and the discussion
of the Indian bill was resumed.
Senator W. ite had the floor when the
Senate took its recess and would have
continued to-night had it not been appar
ent to the friends of the Sanguilly resolu
tion that if the debate on that subject was
renewed Wtiite would talfc until a quo
rum disappeared. For this reason the
recular business was proceeded with.
It is the understanding that to-morrow
rrorning, when there is a lull attendance
of Senator*, the resolution will be again
called up by its friends.
At 11:10 p. M. the Senate adjourned un
til to-morrow, leaving the Indian bill
still unfinished. _

Rumor* of a Lurid Suture Floating at
Washington.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 25.â The
statement was made on the floor of the
House to-day on authority of a prominent
Southern Congressman that Consul-Gen
eral Lee had resigned his office. The Con
gressman stated that he bad seen the dis
patch from the Consul-General at the
State Department and Secretary Olney
had requested that official not to press the
resignation until after the end of the pres
ent administration.
The dispatch i:i question was received
at the State Department either Tuesday
night or Wednesday morning. Govern
ment officials, however, continue to deny
that General Lee's resignation has been
received. Confidence is expressed that
General Lee will be found at his post up
to and including March 4. It is sai ! that
General Lee in cabling ihe State Depart
ment last week in regard to the Ruiz and
Scott cases closed as follows: "If I am not
supported my usefulness here will end
and I had better be recalled."
This, it is thought, may be the dispatch
from which the resignation stories have
arisen.
Rumors of various descriptions have
been floating about Washineton to-nignt,
the most sanguinary of which was one
repornng the assassination of Consul-
General Lee. Joined with tbis and other
sensational reports was one that the War
Department was exercised about a prompt
readiness of troops in the Southern States,
and had address-eel the respective South

GOMEZ <iAI*S A. riClOHt.
Details of a Big liatile That the Span
iard* I tied to Suppress.
NEW -iORK. N. V.. Feb. 26â dis
patch to the Sun from Havana say?: The
estate of Juan Criollo, near Arroyo
Blanco, in the province of Santa dura, is
becoming famous in the history of the
Cuban revolution.
Besides the great victory General Gome:
won there on February 1 over Colonel Ar
jona, the Cuban general has just obtained
in the same place the most important suc
cess of the Cuban army since the revolu
tion began.
The last battle was very hotly con
tested and the battlefield extended to an
other estate called La Reforms, adjoining
Juan Criollo ou the west. The battle
was fought six days ago and the
utmost efforts of the Spanish authorities
in Havana have been exerted to suppress
all news of the engagement, but now that
private reports have reached this city giv
ing full details of the Spanish defeat, the
ujiual official report has been puolished
claiming a victory.
From the very text of the official report
it is easy to see what a disheartening
effect the news has had upon the an
thormes. They confess that Generals
Gasco, Segura and Ruiz, each at
the head of a column, had to
join forces for united action against
Gomez, and they assert that the result of
their alleged victory is that Gomez is in a
difficult position, being unable either to
force the trocha to the east or invade the
province of Matanzas to the west.
A long cable dispatch from the Marouis
of Ahumadato lhe Dufee of Tetuan and
General Azcarraga is said to describe the
situation as it actually exists.
The Duke answered immediately, ask
ing for details and a few hours later the
well-known trick of turning defeats into
victories was played in the form of enthu
siastic congratulations from the Govern
mentto Generals Gasco, Segura and Ruiz
Â»nd, in general, to the army.
The facts derived from the best nnd
most reliable sources are as follows-
General Gasco, at the head of 1500 men
met General Gomfz about 1 o'clock in the
afternoon on the estate of Juan Cri
Gomez was inarching toward tn e â¢
with3'Joo men. c - ;
Tu.> lear inspired by Gomez's nac
among the Spanish and Ms numerica
advantage caused General Gasco to c^ t
orders to retire, while his rear guard waX
instructed to keep up a show of ii-htintf
to prevent the Cubans from to rapidly
pursuing.
But Gomez spoiled this little plan by
ordering his cavalry to advance rapidly
on the flanks of the Spanish column and
attack Gasco on both flanks.
When this move was observed by Gasco
he ordered his column to form a square
and stand with fixed bayonets against the
CabfÂ»n cavulrv.
Gomez's cavalry and infantry then be
â¢Â»an to fire on the compact body presented
by the Spanish square. The advantage
to the Cubans was tremendous as
they had less mass to the volleys
of the Spaniards and as soon as
the latter sought to leave the
square and deploy themselves in guerrilla
order, the Cuban cavalry attacked them,
obliging them to take up their forraer po
sition. The fight had been in progress
two hours and Gjsco bad already lost
more than 100 men killed, when General
Segura apeared with a column oi 2000
men from the direction of the estata i,a
Re for ru a.
Fortunately for Gomez the Spanish re
enforcement came from the west and not
from the east, or otherwise he would have
been himself caught between two tires.
Segura advanced resolutely against tie
right side of the Cuban cavalry, obligir.^
Gomez to withdraw the two lines with
which he was attacking Gasco. Tha
Cuban cavalry then formed in one body to
the left and the infantry faced the fire of
Segura's troops.
AH this was on the' main plain of the
estate of Juan Criollo, and the odds ap
peared then to be against Gomez, who hail
begun the battle with 3000 men againsd
1500. but was now facing 3500 men, of
whom Segura's column was composed of
fresh soldiers just entering the field.
Â±$ut unexpectedly for the Spaniards the
Cuban artillery, whicn Gomez had not yet
called into action, began to fire from the
higher of the two prominent bills on the
estate. The dynamite gun, which in the
earlier battle ot Juan Criollo was not very
effective, now did splendid work.
Three shells exploding in the ranks of
Segura were enough 10 throw the Span
iards into confusion, blowing up, as they
did a whole company of fifty men of the
Spanish forces, hailing from Los Villas.
Gasco was then on La Retorma estate,
having taken advantage of the engage
ment between Segura and Gomez to re
tire to that place. Then Segura's forces
also retired to the same place, severely
harrassed by Gomez. Seeing that the
forces of Segura were also defeated, Gasco
sent messengers to the west asking heJp.
While both the Spanish columns were
trying with all their might on La Reforma
estate to get the better of Gomez, General
Ruiz came to their aid with 1200 more
men.
At the approach of these further Span
ish re-enforcements Gomez retired to the
Juan Criollo estate, ioince the battle of
Peralejo was fought, when Maceo routed
Martinez Campos, no other battle so im
portant has occurred in the Cuban war.

SECRET SERVICE
A Motion Lost to Decrease
the Appropriation
One-Half.
Another Financial Scandal Has'
Sprung Up in the
Assembly.
Friedlander's Connection With the
â¢ Contested Elections Committee
at $5 Per Day.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 25. â The
appropriation bill reported by the Com
mittee on Ways and Means was under con
sideration in the Assembly this afternoon,
when and the item was reached allowing
the Governor $10,000 for his secret service
fund for the next two years an evidently
concocted attack was made upon it by a
few Republicans who have been interest
ing themselves particularly to obtain the
appropriation of $75,000 needed for the
StatÂ« Frintins Office.
Melick of Lancaster, whose smile is as
eternal as the sun that bakes the sands of
his home on the Hojave Desert, pleasantly
moved to cut down the appropriation to
. $6000. He made no explanation at the
lime, but smiled and smiled and remained
. a Me:ick still.
â¢ (ivy of San Diego, chairman of the
A\ ays and Means Committee, defended
the item in the bill. The State Controller,
who was aware of what had been done
viih the original appropriation of $10,090
made two years ago, baa estimated that a
similar amount would be required for the
Governor's secret service during the next
twn years.
Valentine of Los Angeles inquired of
. Mr. Gay what had been the occasion of
making $10,000 necessary, and Guy re
piied that the secret service fund had been
used by the Governor for the purpose of
investigating crimes, and the executive
was not required by law to make any ac
count of the fund to any one.
-Meuck smilingly remarked that the
Governor had sent a private detective
down lo Kern County to look after the
coyote scalp breeding industry in that pro
irle reaion. "I don't wonder at all that
the Governor says he needs the money,"
continued Melict, "and I am noi wiiiing
lo Bhove $10,000 into any man's hand just
because he says he needs it."
Caminetti, rushing to the rescue of the
G ivernor, said that the work ol experts,
paid ou-t of the secret fund, had saved the
6 ate $100,000 within the last few years.
â 'Ware have they saved $100,000?" in-
quired the smile from the desert.
'â¢In sending experts to investigate and
report as to the expenditures made by
various boards and commissions, and com
pelling them to comply with the iaw,"
responded Caminetti with a sweep of his
Land as broad as his statement.
L.'avitt of Alameda, who last night re
commended the Governor to the tender
mercy of fcihanaban and was rebuffed
theretor as a politician, hoped that the
amendment would be adopted. He be
lieved :n placing in the hands of the Gov
ernor such a sum as would enable bim lo
hire a good expert and send him around
the country. The proposition was to pay
$10,0(0 mio a fund without compelling
any one to account for it.
Melick came to the front again. "While
it sounds well to say that $100 000 was
' saved bj the use of this secret fund I
th:nk it is more sound than anything
else," he said. "The State Board of Ex
aminers has an expert whose business it
is to look into the accounts of these offi
cial?.
ishanahan started in to explain that the
appropriation was needed, when he was
li.skf.-d by Leavitt whether he knew t. at an
expert had been employed and paid out
01 tue Governor's secret service fui:d.
"1 know nothing as to that, sir," re
plied Snanahan, With great dignity. "I
presume that the expert employed to in
vestigate thos** institutions has been em
pioved by the Governor."
"It has been intimated," said Guy, "by
one of the gentlemen that he didn't be
lieve that so large an amount should be
placed in the hands of any one person
without requiring him to account for it.
.If i' is not proper that the Governor
should have $10,000 for fear that he might
misuse it the same objection coum with
equal force be applied to $5000. I have
been informed that three or lot.r of the
jnost notorious criminals now in thp pene
tentiaries have been oetected by the uÂ«e
of this fund. 1 have the utmost confi
dence in the discretion and integrity of
the Governor in us;ng this fund."
Va. online of Los Angeles nsked whether
the appropriation had been subjected to
the surne â  orizontal cut of 10 per cent as
he understood had been the case with
other appropriations.
Guy explained that the salaries and
c mpensation of officers had not been
touchea at all.
:j!e spoke warmly in favor of the
$10, (XX) appropriation, and Leavitt took tne
â¢floor again atxl asiidi whether the fund
Jud not been $GojO previous to Governor
Budd's inauguration, after wnicn it had
bt-en.increa-ed to $10,000.
In re? jonse to a question Guy informed
Dibble thai the Governor himself had
asked for the $10,000 appropriation.
Cutter spoke in tavor of the appropria
: ton. I; it were cut down, he said, many
people would think it was done through
.revenge lecause o: the attitude of the
Governor toward the State Printing Office.
The amendment wa< defeated by a viva
voce vo;e, Valentine's "no" b ing the
omy negative heard.
Another scandal has cropped up in the
Ar-aeinbly, this time, however, not involv
ing nther t c iion.or or the jud"mentof
the members. A. A. t riedlaude" a San
trumisco attoriic-y, i s lne , arty invc.lved.
He was appointed sen.-eant-at-arms of the
Contested Election Committee when it was
lnve-ugatmg the Hovey-Power contest
After returning from San Francisco and
drawing nis week's pay and mi.eaee,
amounting to $o*. he up plied to the Con
trolerat the end of the second week for
the s-'fo:ifl week's salary, 'i he Controller
sad Fnedlauder was not on the roll and
not entitled to any more pay an.i insisted
that Friediander's payment uad b?en only
lor one wees. Friedlunder afterward
brought him what purported to be a certi
fied copy of an appointment on file with
the clerk of ihe Assembly. The document
stated that Fru dianaer had b?en aptr.int
ed sergfant-at-arma to tlie Contested Elec
tion-! Committee with the au.hori y;\>f
Speaker Coombs at a per diem ot $5 and
waÂ« signed by Chairman Kenyun.
Kenvon stateJ that he had Mgned the
appointment, but ti. at the statement that
(Speaker Coombs had authorized the ap
jiointmpiu aii'l the words, ''at a per diem
of $5," had been added by some one afier
Ke ivon had sgned it.
Friedlander made the following state
â¢ meut to-night to a Call reporter: "On
January 14 1 stoke to Speaker Coombs
about being appointed on the permanent
roll, having been recommended by several
persons standing high in the ranks of the
Republican party, and was told then that
there was no vacancy, but on pointing out
the necessity of an 'assistant sergeant-at
arms who could be attached to the Com
mittee on Contested Elections Coombs
then told me to get the signatures o' the
majority of the committee, which I did.
1 t en presented my application to Chair
man Kenyon, who took it to Coombs, and
X -nyoa then told me that Coombs vaid
that if he thought it necessary he oculd
have his permission to make ilie appoint
ment, which Kenyon did. I went to San
Francisco with the committee on the
Hoey vs. f over contest, and was paid for
serv ces from the 14th to tke 21st and have
served ever since at every rueetins of the
committee. Some few days a o, after the
last content was heard, and thinking the
committee would meet no more, 1 asked
Kenyon ;o sign thai part which reads to
ihe effect that he had made the appoint
ment with the consent of the Speaker,
which he did. The assistant clerk noti
fied the Controller and sergeant-at-nrms,
and when the Controller ?ta:ed that the
p?r diem had not been tix d 1 ndiied *f5
per diem,' which was the amount 1 baa
been previously paid.
"Tnere was no forgery, for the whole
thing is written in my owr. handwriting
and iv possession of the House for inspec
tion. It is only another case of a chance
to discover a 'mare's nest.'
"I am ready for any kind of investiga
tion, and if Lhe Assembly can afford the
time and expense, I am just as anxious as
Mr. Coombs."
T:ie foregoing statement was given the
reporter in writing by Mr. Fnedlander.
He added verbally: "I would like to
have ar. investigation, and if mere is one
the newspapers will have plenty of good
items. I'll warrant that Speaker Coombs

The Grand lotnl Amk-d fÂ« Already Ovrr
$ 10,000,000.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 25.â Either
the Legislature or the Governor will have
to wield the pruning-knife with vigor on
measures appropriating money, or, from
the present outlook, the Sta.e tax levy
will need to be nearer 65 cents on the $100
than 50 cents. The latter limit has al
ready been passed, even thougti there is a
surplus in the treasury of about. $750,000
from the las}, appropriations m-ule.
The general appropriation bill, provid
ing mean* for the maintenance lor two
years of tho State Government, including
all State institutions, as introduced in the
Assembly, foots up $4,815,776. To this
must be added the amount rized by law
for schools for two years at the rate o! $7
for earh census child, which is $4 629,92(3
also $480,000, the 2-ient :nx for f':e State
University at BtrteHey; $K75,000 ror
orphans and half-orphans, and $282,870
for the interest and "inking fund. This
makes a total of $10 883.572.
In addition to these the Senate Finance
Committee has already reported favorably
deficiency ciaims allowed by the State
Board of Examiners and other apprupria
ttonÂ« amounting in the aggregate to
$1,961,222 It will therefore be seen that
if all these measures pass, and most of
them have already pasted the Assembly,
the Slate will have contracted liabilities
to the amount of $12,844,794.
This total does not include $125,000 re
appropriated for the Affiliated Colleges,
$200,000 reappropriated lor impounding

In view of the tact that the general ap

has made palpable short allowances for
public institutions, the amounts in some

subsistence for inmates, that appropria

mated, by at least f'200,000, including ap
propriations for district, agricultural socie

had not the Finance Committee killed
many appropriation bills in their in
fancy and greatly curtailed the amounts
in others. Where tha cutting is to be
done now is a matter of great perplexity,
but clnims are likely to bo the ones to
suffer first. There may also be some cut
ting of the general appropriation bill on
provisions that do not apply to the main
tenance of public institutions, such as
asvhims, State prisons and reform schools.
The tax levy biil will be the last measure
acted upon by the Legislature, and Chair
man Voorhies of the Finance Committee
is of the opinion that matters will be so
arranged that it will not call for more than
a 50-cent lew.
That the Finance Committee has put
the knife in deep is shown by the following
statement of some of the amounts asked lor
to be applied to improvements and repairs
in various State institutions and the
amounts allowed :
" Name. I Asked. Allowed
Stockton Insane Asylum I $20,000 $10,000

Only six institutions, it will be noticed,
got all they asked for. If the report of
me Finance Committee is adopted, and
ther<Â» is, every reason to believe it will be,
San Francisco will get $20,000 for a State
luper hospital, but nothing for a State
building, an i the future Governors of
California will be as far as ever from hav
ing the State supply them, with an official
residence at Sacramento.

gation this morning, taking up the coal
trust, with President Samuel Sloan of the
Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Rail

the question of handling coal, and an
agreement was made ns to the percentage
of coal the roads represented were to carry.
' President Thomas of the Erie road was
next sworn. He said he was at the con
ference of the presidents of the various
coal carriers last year and the Erie re
ceived a 4-per-cent allotment.

allotments and the witness admitted that
they were correct. He said that his com

The witness said he was not aware that
the price of coal was increased $1 a ton
since the conference. He said, to the
great astonishment of the members of the
committee, that he did not know the
present price of coal.
Frencis H. Keening of St. Louis, a
wholesale grocer, said he refused to sign
a factor's agreement with the Americm
Sugar Refining Company and that he had,
consequently, to pay more for sugar than
those wtio had a factor's agreement.
The witness said that the American
Sugar Refining Company had attempted
to exclude the Louisiana planters' sugar
from competition.
From the testimony of the witness it
deyeloned that the American Sn<;ar Rena
me Company during the grinding season
during whicti ttie southern crop of the
country is being produced, lowered the
price of sugar in St. Louis and immedi
ately after the grinding season caused the
price of its product to be increased.
Clinton \V. Winter of Walden, N V.,
vie*- president of the Stevens Coal Com
pany, testified that his company soid coal
to the Lie high Valley Railroad Company
and that i; received 60 per cent 01 what
the product brought at tide water, and
that the remainder was paid to the rail
road com r any. Witness said the pr>Â«Â» of
stove coal per ton at tide water wa9 $9 87,
and, therefore, his company receivu .* J 32
for a ton and the railroad company $1 50.
John B. Dickerson, sales agent lor tue
New Yorlc, Ontario and Western Railroad
Company, said that the sales agents had
nothing to do with riling tno price of coal
and declared that the law of supply ana
demand alone fixed it.
Sales Acent Heilnerof the Lebi^n and

amined. His testimony was unimpor ant.
At its conclusion Mr. Lexow announced
that the committee had concluded its n
vestigation, unless it was found necessary
to meet again.
An executive ses-ion was held by the
committee after the proceedings closed.
Chairman Lexow at its termination said:

THREATENED RIOT
AT LOS ANGELES
Hundreds of Hungry Men
Clamor for Employ
ment.
Qihinous Hints As to What May
Happen Should Relief Be
Denied Them.
With Tears in His Eyes the Mayor
Promises to Do Everything in
His Power.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Feb. 25.â The
presence of a large body of unkempt, un
shaven, tattered, sunken-cheeked/hollow
eyed hungry men in front of the City Hall
here this afternoon appealing to Mayor
Snyder for woi k and wages moved that of
iicial to tears.
He hftd listened attentively to a petition
which had been read and approved at a
meeting of this city's army of unem
. ployed held earlier in the day at the' Old
Pisza on North Main street. With tear
.-taiued c eeks and a voice husky with
emotion the Mayor said:
"I will not deliver an address; my heart
is too full for that As I look on your
faces I recognize what your sentiments
are, and feel as deeply as you do that
something should be done for you and
your families.
"I will carefnlly consider your petition
at once. I have considered thii question
and in my message to the council embody
what I think to be the desired method for
relief. Bonds could be issued, it is true,
but it would be foqr or five months before
they could be realized on. The aid is too
remote.
"Trust us, however, to aid you in your
extremity, but be very careful to do noth
ing rash that would take away the sym
pathy now felt for you by any overt act. I
will report to your meeting on next Satur
day morning."
The situation relating to the unem
ployed of the ciiy is fast assuming a se
rious aspect. Mayor Snyder's fears, how
ever, so far as the "families" of these men
are concerned and the sympathy which ho
referred to, are no doubt greatly mis
placed.
Most of these men are non-residents of
this city, attracted here largely, no doubt,
by Captain Frazier's Good Samaritan
Mission â one of the best- planned and best
conducted evils which ever afflicted any
community.
The opportunity afforded by this mis
sion of getting rooms, bathsand meals
fora mere pittance has attracted most of
the present unemployed to this city, and
now that the mission :s about to be closed
these men see trouble ahead; hence their
appeal.
All of the leaders and spokesmen at
their meeting to-day are said to be non
residents. The threatening, ominous lan
guage of the petition has attracted the
most serious consideration from the beat
people of tiie city.
â It is not calculated to enlist sympathy
from the people {renerally. Honest, Datri
Â£>tic, work-lovine men do not employ
threats in their appeals, so say our leading
citizens.
Morrison I. Swift, a resident of Massa
chusetts, led the speaking to-day and in
dulged in much ominous language.
A circular which was distributed at the
meeting referred in two or three places to
the "d-splay of wealth and power at
Washington on March 4," winding up as
"Let the unemployed inaugurate in
other cities on March 4 While National
politics is inaugurating and. blessing it
self,- let National poverty inaugurate and
oiganize itself into a permanent bodyâ
the Natioual Unemployedâ to keep itself
in the eye o;" tlie wealthy Nation until it is
considered, fed and employed."
In the petition to Mayor Snyder the fol
lowing is a sample 01 the language em
ployed:
"We are not willing to have this matter
delayed any longer, and we will not an
swer for the consequences to the property
of this city if the thousands who are desti
tute and desperate are not given work.
"By delaying and delaying do you not
teach the unemployed to believe that
their only chance of obtaining considera
tion is to riot?"
Some action w 11 be taken by the City
Council relating to this matter at once.

STOCKTON FISHERMAN MISSING.
"Catfish" Johnson Disappears Under Cir
cumstances Leading to Suspicion of
Foul Play.
STOCKTON, Cal., Feb. 25.â "Catfish"
Johnson has disappeared and his friends
fear that he has either been drowned or
murdered.
The missing man's name is Peter John
son, but he is known all along the water
front as "Catfish," as he makes a living
by fishing in the channels ana sloughs in
this county. Together with a man named
Gus Lundstrom he owns an ark that is
moored on the Banner Island shore of
McL3oils Lake. For some time there has
been bad blood between them, according
to one of tbe recent occupants of the ark,
and each has bsen striving to save enough
money to buy tue other out.
Lundstrom has been away for some
time working on a potato ranch on one of
the islands, and Johnson ha") been living
in a 'Shack" on Twelve-mite Plough.
Every Thursday night he came to Stock
ton witn his catch of lish, and had been in
the habit of staying in the ark until re
turning to his tubing grounds.
Several months a^o Johnson gave per
mission to a Dane named Hansen and to
a ragpicker named Anderson to occupy
the ark during hisabsence. On Tnursuuy
last, when Johnson came up from Twelve
miie Slough, he was in an ugly frame of
mind, and oriered tbe occupants ol the
aric to get oat forthwith.
He was cursing about their stay in the
place, and also informed boia that he
intended to take entire possession and not
allow his partner, Lundstrom, to have
anything more to do with it.
After selling his fish Johnson returned
to the ark and crder Ragpicker Anderson
to gel him 15 cents worth of wine. The
latter purchased two gallons of tanglefoot
and this trio had a "time" on boa.ru the
ark.
Those nearby heard the sounds of rev
elry, but Anderson declared this morning
that there was no row or struggle on
board. The occupants of the big dredger
that lies a few yards to the north of the
ark say that there were sounds of a
struggle, as though the men on board the
arK were engaged in a scullle.
Next morning Johnson hau disappeared.
His hat and shoes were still in the ark,
but nothing could be found of him, and
his boat was still moored by the side o( the
ark. Anderson reported the matter to the
police ana the Sheriff's ollice, he believing
that Johnson had been drowned during
the night. Those who live near think
that this may be the caÂ«e, or that he was
knocked overboard during a scuffle with
one of his fellow-occupants of the ark.

EXCITEMENT IN A
SAUSALITO COURT
Troubles of the Schloh and
Lewis Families Given
an Airing.
Justice Bellrude Threatens to
Adjourn if Attorneys Can
net Agree.
Majir Edwin Lewis, a Graduate of
West Point, Accnses a Neigh
bor cf Assault.
SAUSALITO, Cal., Feb. 25.â There
were lively times in Justice Bellrude's
court this afternoon while the case of the
people, upon the complaint of Major Ed
win Lewis, against B. A. Schloh, accused
by Lewis of abusive language and assault
upon Mrs. M. A. Lewis, the wife of the
major, was on trial.
Justice Beiiruiie atone point in the pro
ceedings threatened to adjourn court if
the attorneys could not retain their com
posure.
It seems that some time ago Mr. Schloh,
who lives at Waldo Point, just out of Sau
saiito, took pity upon Major Lewis and
his wife, who had been burneH out of
their home, and gave them permission to
occupy his cottage during the winter
months, the Lewises to care for the
chickens and other animals, while Mr.
and Mrs. Schloh were in the City.
When Mr. Schloh made up his mind to
return to Marin County he gave the major
notice to vacate his premises, but to his
surprise the Lewises refused to move, and
Schloh was compelled to bring an eject
ment suit.
When the case came up before Justice
Thomas Foltrell Major Lewis reviled the
court, referring disrespectfully to the red
hair of his Honor, and that official
promptly sent him to jail for twenty-iour
hours for contempt of court.
The Schlohs gained possession of their
home, but found things in a terrible state.
Everything was broken and ruined and
the Lewises had killed ana eaten most of
the chickens.
"Every time the major had company,"
said Mr. Schloh to-aay. "he would have
chicken lor dinner, and they were my
chickens he had."
After the Lewises had been compelled I
to Jeave Mrs. Lewis returned with Con- j
stable Garrity oi Sausaiito to obtain some j
things she claimed were in the house be
loii-'ing to her.
While there, Lewis alleges in his com
plaint. B. A. bchloh r.ied abusive lan
guage to his wife and attempted to do her
bodily injury.
Constable Garrity swore to-day that
Schloh did not lay hands on the woman,
but only ordered her off his premises.
The case had progressed some when Judge
M. C. Dufficy, acting as prosecuting at
torney, drew up a new complaint, which
Lewis signed and swore to, charging
Â£chloh with assault.
The second case then proceeded and
trouble constantly occurred between Duf
ficy and Charles de V. Musaus, who acted
as Schloh's attorney. He accused Dufficy
of conduct unbecoming an attorney and
charged him with nerverting the truth.
Adolph Sylva, S'.ujalito's prosecuting
attorney, then took a hand in the pro
cepdings on behalf of the defendant
Justice Bellru'le took the case under ad
visement and will give a decision Satur
day afternoon.
Major Lewis is % character in Marin
County and is a graduate of West Poini.
HelÃ well-known in Democratic political
circles in M.irin County, where, during
the last convention, he created consider
able notoriety by opposing Superior
Judge Angelotti's "indorsement by the
Democrats.

SAN RAFAEL, Cal., . Feb. 25.â The
Sylva-Ring contested election case came
up before Superior Judge F. M. Angelotti
this afternoon and was submitted to
him without argument. He stated he
would render a written decision.
The case has attracted much attention,
both on account of its sensational devel
opments and the intricate questions in re
gard to the election laws. Taylor was de
feated by thirty-two votes for the office of
Supervisor in District No. 3 in Marin
County and brought a contest against his
successful opponent, claiming irregular
ities in regard to the election boards in
Mill Valley and Boiinas districts.
All testimony introduced in regard, to
violations of the purity of election law?,
by both contestant and contestee, was by
stipulation stricKen from the records. The
decision is eagerly awaited and an appeal
will be taken to the Supreme Court by the
unsuccessful party.

ARREST FOR THEFT
AT SACRAMENTO
Embarrassing Plight of
a Talented Young
. Englishman.
Over $100 Worth of His Em
ployers' Goods Found in
.His Apartments.
He Cut Quite a Dash in Local Society
and Occasionally Went On
a Spree.
> SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Feb. 25â Fred S.
Proctor, a talented young Englishman,
who for several months past has occupied
the position of confidential clerk in the
wholesale hardware firm of Baker &
Hamilton, in this city, was arrested this
afternoon on a charge of petty larceny
sworn to by Manager F. Dassonville and
is now an inmate of the city prison pend
ing examination, with probabilities that
graver charges may be brought against
him.
Several months since Proctor came to
California from New York with excellent
references addressed to the firm, which
stated that he was a good all-around man
and worthy of the greatest confidence.
On the strength of these recommenda
tions be obtained a position, and, although
he failed to rill the expectations of the
manager, was retained.
Shortly after tiis arrival Proctor made
the acquaintance of a young optician
named T. Dewolf Hanna, and as both
were of the heavy-swell order they cut
quite a dash in local society and occupied
the same apartments.
Several nights since, while out on a
spree, Prcctor ordered some wine Â«t a
saloon, and aa he was minus the neces
sary funds to defray the bill, he banded
the bartender a new Colt'd revolver in lieu
of the money.
The matter was brought to the attention
of the police, who started an investigation,
at the same time notifying the linn, and
to-day Manager Dassonville arrived and
swore out a complaint against Proctor.
This evening the epuuments of T. De
wolf Hanna, which have been occupied in
common by Proctor, were searched and
over $100 worth of stolen goods were dis
covered. The former, however, has not
been connected with the unfortuate affair.
As it is believed that this pilfering has
been going on since stock was taken at the
first of the year, it is impossible at the
present time to ascertain how great a loss
the linn has sustained.
Proctor gave evidence in his appearance
and address as being a highly educated
and pohsned young man, and it is ru
mored that he is intimately connected
with a family of the English nobility.

CONTIGUOUS FISHERIES.
A Permanent Joint Commission to Take
Charge of Them Has Been
Recommended.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. 25.â The
President has sent to Congress the re
port of the joint commission representing
the United States and Canada relative
to the preservation of the fisheries in the
waters contiguous to trie United States
and Canada as provided by the joint
agreement of 1892 between the United
States and Great Britain. The subjects
dealt with are the limitation or preven
tion of exhaustive or destructive methods
of taking fish and shell fish in these
waters and also in the waters of tne open
seas outside of the territorial limits of
either country to which the inhabitants
of the respective countries may habitually
resort for the purpose of such fishing;
the prevention of the polluting or obstruct
ing such conticuous waters to the detri
ment of the fisheries or navigation; the
close season expedient to be enforcd and
observed in such contiguous waters Dy
the inhabitants of both countries as res- j
pects the taking of several kinds of fish
and shell fish and the adoption of prac
tical methods of restocking and repien- \
ishing such waters with hsh and shell |
fish and the means by which such fish :
life may be preserved and increased.
The fisheries to be covered by the com- I
mission included the entire fisheries of
the Atlantic sea coast and the lake and
river fisheries irÂ» general between the ]
province of O.itario and the border States ;
from New York to Minnesota, inclusive; i
Rainy Lake and river and Lake of the I
Woods, between Ontario and Manitoba:
the ColumDia River, which crosses the
international boundary line from British
Columbia into the State of Washington;
the Fraser River, Gulf of Georgia, Puget
Sounti and Straits of Juan Ue Fuca, con- ,
tiguous to the British Columbia and
Washington.
All these waters except Rainy Lake and
Columbia River were visited by the com
mission. They found it impossible to con- j
sider fully ail the questions which the j
subject presents and were unable in many i
cases to reach more than general conclu
sions.
Tr.eir observations demonstrated the
inexpediency of attempting to regulate
any of these fisheries uy a rigid code of
enactments owing to their constantly
changing character and conditions.
They recommend therefore a permanent
joint commission which shall have 1
direct supervision cf these fisheries j
and ba empowered to conduct the neces
sary investigations and to institute such
modifications in the regulations as cir
cumstances may demand.
TIME TO ELEVATE THE CROSSINGS
A Surface Railway Collision in Chicago
Which Three Persons Wera
Killed and Many Injured.
CHICAGO, 111.. Feb. 25.â Three per
sons killed outright and several injured,
three of whom it is thought may yet die,
is the frightful result of a collision of two
trains on the Chicago and Eastern Illinois
Railroad with an electric car of the Calu
met Electric road at the One Hundred
and Third-streot crossiug this ufiernoon.
The dead are:
George O'Mally, motorman.
Peter Fucher Prince, a cattle-buyer.
R. W. Younjr, a collector.
The more seriously injured are:
Robert Hynes, employe of the Calumet
Company, may die.
Henry "Madison, conductor on the car
recovery doubtful.
Mary Moichelle, internal injuries and
serious bruises, may not recover.
F. A. Young, lire man for Chicago and
Eastern Illinois, will recover.
The collision occurred shortly before
2 o'clock. The crossing gates of the Chi
cago and Eastern Illinois road were down
but witnesses to the accident say the
motorman waa apparently unable to stop
his car. It crashed through the pates
dirafctly in front of a rapidly moving
engine attached to a southbound suburban
train. The car was partially shattered by
the collision that followed and a moment
later was ground into a thousand frag
ments by an express train bound toward
the city, which cashed into the wreck.
Eight or ten passengers were on board
the shattered motor and were more or less
injured. The engines of the two railwuy
trans were also damaged, an I the fire
man on ti.e outbound suburban was
thrown to the ground and >everely hurt.
The motorman was lying under the
front platform of his car and was crusned
to death. The mangled bodies of two of
the passengers were taken from ihe debri
and removed to the Morgue. They were
killed outright. The injured were taken
to Hospitals in patrol wagons.

PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HOMES.
1 An Order From the President Strikes the
Black Hlls Like a Thunderbolt
From a Clear Sky.
DEADWOOD, S. Dak.. Feb. 25.â Like a
thunderbolt out of a clear sky came the
order of President Cleveland to add ferty
two townships of the Black HIU3 to the
forest reserve.
Twenty-five thousand people have their
homes in this section, which comprises
the timber and lumber section of the Black
Hills.
The hills are also gold-bearing.
Meetings are called in every town of the
section to proiest against the order.
At a meeting in this city, called to order
by Mayor Star, ex-United Slates Senator
I Moody explained the law under which the
I President executed this proclamation.
He also explained how it strucK
the vitals of the mining industries
I in this section by prohibiting the cutting
j of timber, and di.~francb.ised the people
J living; on the reserve, making it impos
sible for them to reap any benefits of their
! improvements. At present sawmills
abound.
A committee was appointed to protest
by telegraph against the enforcement of
the order until the Black Hills can pre
sent their case.

When a young couple runs away to get

until the " honey -moon "is over. When
this young couple get settled down to the
regular hum-drum of life, they'll manage
all right and find solid happiness in any
case, if they have good hearts and sound
health. All depends on that.
It's wonderful how much health has to
do with married happiness. Sickness af-
fects the temper. You can't be happy
nor make others happy if you're ailing.
When you find yourself irritable, easily
worried, beginning to "run-down" it's
because your blood is getting poor. You
need richer blood and more of it. Your
blood-making organs need to be vitalized
by Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discov-

it is for everyone whose blood is impure

CAKSOX, Net., Feb. 26.â Unhappy
news reached Bob Fitzsimmons* camp at
Cook's ranch to-day, and gloom now per
<Vac<es tbe place, where only yesterday
.11 was cheery and jolly. It was a tele
gram from New York, and conveyed the
; . unwelcome information that Mrs. Sam
' wells, the mother of Martin Julian and
â¢â¢ Mrs/Bcbsri Fitzsimmons, wa: dead.
She had been ailing for weeks, but it
"*. lie ver occurred to any of the family that
: ; her malady was likely to prove fatal. The
*' "physicians had given every encourage
." meat for the hope that she would recover.
.= When Fitz and Julian left the big
\. metropolis on their journey toward Car
â¢ â¢ son it was with full belief that Mrs. Fitz
aimmons, who remained behind to nurse
' hermother, would be able to follow within
a few days, and probably bo accompanied
" by Mrs. Samwolls.
â¢ 'â¢ The news of to-day, however, was a Dlow
â¢ to the whole camp. Julian took it most
Â to heart, naturally. For an hour or more
th.3 poor little fellow lay upon a bed and j
' moaned and sobbed as if his heart would
b.eafc. He bad lost the best and only real
ââ friend he had on carth â his mother.
" "Martin, what effect will this news have
upon the right?" unthinkingly asked one
. of Fitzsimmonb 1 trainers, who endeavored I
to console the big pugilist's brother-in
law
"Oh, don't mention the fight to me," I
said Julian, turning upon the trainer say- j
agely. 'What do I care about the fight
now' l don't give a snap of my finger if
. it comes off or not." Then he sobbed
again like a child. 4 'Tuis is the cruelest
blow fate could have inflicted upon me," <
he said.
Fitzsimmons suspended his training J
work in consequence of the news and even |
" refused to receive visitors who drove out
to the ranch armed with passes and spe
cial permits to gaze upon him. Shortly ,
after lunch he and Julian drove into town
to send away some telegrams. Expres
sions of sympathy everywhere greeted
} â¢ them, particularly Julian.
The latter was in doubt for some time
. as to whether or not he would start East
to-night in order to attend his mother's
â¢ funeral, fie finally received a telegram
. from his sister, Mrs. Fitzsimmons, how
. ever, which had the effect of causing him
â¢ td make up his mind definitely as to his
pians.
This dispatch conveyed the information
. â¢ that Mr?. Fitzsimmons would have the
body embalmed and preserved in a receiv
; ing vault until after the Corbett-Fitzsim
mons contest, so that Martin and Bob may
see the remains before they are interred. "
Fitz had an odd experience while in
town this afternoon. He left Julian for a
.few minutes and went into the postofnee
to get bis mail. "While in there a dozen
or more amateur photographers lined up
In -front of the building and made ready
to "shoot" the Cornish man when he
should make his reappearance.
When Bob came to the door and beheld
â¢ . w.i.at was in store for him he was immedl
")ely seized with an attack of cold feet.
â  eon tract for furnishing only exclusive
photographs stared him in the face and
the lear of forfeiting the few sheckels de
pending upon the :aithful fulfillment of
Â° that contract caused, his teeth to chatter.
He dared not confront that array of out
; laws, so he beat a nasty retreat, and be
seect.ed tne postmaster to hide him or let
1 im out of the building through some
dark and secret passage. . .
. . There are no tunnels or trapdoors in
'the Government building, so the best Bob
could get was a rear window.
He accepted this means of escape as it
.â only required a ten-foot drop into the soft
and spongy snow and all the rest seemed
easy. Fitz made the leap safely and was
chuckling merrily to himself over, the
j clever manner in which he had fooled the
1 kodac fiends when he happened to glance
lever his shoulder and discovered to his
'\hÂ©rror that the horde of them were en
circling the entire building ana in hot
pursuit of him. Bob turned up bis oat
collar as a partial protection from the in
sinuating rays and then broke into a run.
He had not sprinted twenty steps, how
ever, before his lees got tangled up and he
went sprawling off the sidewalk and into j
the snow and slush in the street. He slid
* along on bis face, skinning his nose, and
. gathered up a mouthful of mud as he
went, and than wound up by standing on
his head.
:'â  By this time every one of the armed vil
lains was upon him, and before he could
\ recover himself dozens of photographs had
been taken of him i;Â« all of his chagrin and
.. humiliation,

SILER. DELANEY. JEFFRIES.
Trainers Delaney and Jeffries Arrive and Are Welcomed by Referee Siler.
Bob wants his friends to understand
that he is not getting to be a crar.t and
that he is not making himself uncivil and
offensive because he likes it. He says he
is trying to pick up some "easy" money
by acceding to tbe whim of one who has
dollars to throw away and he does not
want a good thing spoiled. Therefore he
will cont nue to be exclusive, so far as
posing for photographs is concerned, until
St. Patrick's day.
Fitz recently developed a surprising ap
prehension in regard to the Marquis of
Queensberry rules as interpreted by Ref
eree George Siler, and is still a topic of
most serious discussion among the sports
and betting men already on the ground.
Just what Fuz's conduct means is what is
puzzling them most.
Tho^e who do not know the Cornishman
intimately and are unfamiliar with his
craft and cunning are becoming otftspoken
in their belief that Bob is showing him
self to be weak-kneed by objecting to the
rule which permits hitting with a free arm
in the clinches and also in tbe breakaway.
They argue that bis conduct iooks par
ticularly suspicious in view of the fact that
he has always been considered Corbett's
superior as an in-fighter and a veritable
master of clinch and breakaway blows.
That he should oppose this metfiod of
lighting at this late tfay is taken as evi
dence that he is afraid of the big Califor
nian.
But this opinion Is not shared by the
wise ones, who are always on the alert for
the low down of every trick and turn in
sportdom. They well know that if Fitz
really feared any particular blow which
Corbett is practicing up be would not be
fool enough to let anybody know it, much
less the world.
These people shut one eye significantly
when the subject is broached to them and
advise you to "keep your shirt on and
watch for the joker."
"Juilan and a few more of them are
working that scheme," said one old sport
to me to-day. "They want to do a little
THE LADY AND MR. FITZ.
"BY A COPYRIGHTED IVOiM^N.
(Intercepted.)
To tbe Journal-Examiner (Copyrighted):
CARSON, Feb. 25, '97.
I awoke this morning and found myself famous.
Everybody seems to know that I am the lady who came here to interview the
pugilists tor the Examiner.
I find myself looking into mirrors and talking to myself.
Pray heaven 1 do not become insane.
1 wrote to Miss Anthony last night about the great victory achieved by our sex
in my advancement. 1 told her that the Examiner has six of its best men here, in
cluding the Business Manager and Sporting Editor. Yet they found it necessary
to send for me to do the work.
I do hope the men writers won't be jealous.
I urged Miss Anthony to recommend the Examiner to all her friends as the first
journal in the world, that had Corbett interviewed by a lady.
â¦ * * _"'â ;â¢â â¢â " * Â»â¢â¢â¢.â¢%Â«
I have just learned that my article on Corbett was intercepted by THE CALL
and appeared in its columns this morning.
Isn't that just too dreadful? - -. . â :
Some one must have tapped the wires or bribed the messenger.
1 suppose, Mr. Editor, tnat you can copy the article out of THE CALL. Per
haps it would be well to wait a day or two before you let it appear. 1 remember
that last week we printed a story about a gentleman whose eyes were injured by a
quail flying in his face. I read the story in THE CALL four months ago, yet lam
told you marked it "exclusive" on the paper you sent to Mr. Hearst.
Aren't you "cute
Now we're copyrighted we can copy everybody's stories and no one can copy us.
I have seen Mr. Fitz, and in consequence am suffering from a bilious attack !
Ihe idea of pitting that sprawling heap of angles against the statuesque Mr.
Corbett! 1 didn't need your instructions to give Fitz the worst of it.
He deserves the worst. /
He treated rae-nw like a beast I saw him at his quarters and told him that 1
had been sent to interview him by the Examiner.
.Got a bell on you? >J> he asked sneeringly.
No 1 haven't," 1 said, and my blue eyes blazed with anger. "Why do
you ask?" *
..i " lÂ£^ nt know ." he drawled, "but what you might get lost or stolen up here.
Its a wild country."
"I suppose you think it strange," I said, "that a defenseless woman should be
sent to interview you, but the Examiner will yet send women to do stranger things
than this." . .: â¢ . . â¢ s
"I don't doubt it," he growled. "I suppose I'll see you at the next cocking
main, or maybe you II take in the comin' dog-fight How would a good lively pie
sdckin' tee suit you?" yb
"I trust," I replied, stiffly, "that the great paper which employs me will always
find me at the post of duty, no matter how difficult or dangerous that post may be.
Dog-ti?htor man-fight, ic's all the same."
"But," I asked, "why do you write for a paper of which you have so poor an
opinion r
"Maybe I want to play even," he snarled. "Maybe the Examiner didn't have
Wyatt barp made referee of tie last fight Maybe Earp didn't throw the fight
Maybe 1 wasn t swindled out of $10,000 by the little game, and maybe 1 don't want
to get back the money I lost"
"But Mr. Fitz, dear Mr. Fitz," I said, coaxingly, "surely yofci don't blame me
for that. I wasn ton the paper then. Now what snail write for you ?"
Oh, write any old rot that comes into your head. It'll be no better nor worse
than the columns of slush they are writing about me every day."
So I wrote the following, which sounds just like what we've been publishing
about this rude man: b
"Each day 1 feel the effects less of my daily work and rise in the morning free
from a condition of soreness. The work to-day was most satisfactory. The only
embarrassment I have suffered at all is a slignt soreness on the ball of the right
foot, caused by continually springing around upon thai portion of my pedal extremi
ties. This will disapp?ar in a day or two.
"The country is still covered with snow, which is slowly melting, filling the
atmosphere with humUity, thus enablirrg me to get good sweats. I am all right uo

What, with these four events crowding one on top of the other, the irreconcilable

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1897.
gambling on the result of the tight, and
they want to get as big odds as possible.
They have got to do something to prevent
the price from rising.
'â¢You need not be surprised to hear of
Fitz kicsing up all sorts of rows over tbe
rules and everything else between now
and the 17th of March, so as to keep up
tbe impression that be is shaky. Those
folra know what they are doing, and they
are as sharp a set as ever came over the
pike."
Fitz himself is inclined to come down
somewhat from his perch so to speak, in
reference to his complaint about tbe
rules. During a short chat I had with
him this afternoon while he was in town,
be declared that his sole objections had
been misunderstood. .
"Siler does me an injustice when he
says that I expressed a desire not to live
! up to the agreement to hit in the clinches
land breaks," he said. "I don't think,
: however, that he would intentionally
! wrong me. He simply muuuder
! stood. What I said was that I
I was opposed to the issuance of
! any set of rules at this time
j which would bind me down to any
j particular method of fighting and permit
i Corbet: to concentrate his practice on tac
tics by which he would bt enabled to
; block my best blows. I suggested tha*
! the matter of rules be left until the
I day of the contest and have them
j announced whiie we are in the
j ring. That would allow Corbett and
myself to practice all of the styles during
our training and wouid be as fair to one
las to the other. lam not afraid to meet
Corbett at any style of fighting ever
heard of, but I want a square deal,
i that's all. 1 will be satisfied to allow
! hitting in tbe clinches, or I will agree to
! breakaway clean, but I don't propose to
i enter into a compact to adopt either style
i until the day of the fight. Now there is
tbe whole story in t. nutshell."
X had a talk subsequently with Siler
and explained Fitsimmons' version to
him. The famous referee smiled.
"That was scarcely the wny Bob pat it
when he and I first discussed the matter,"
said he. "But I cannot see where any
good can be accomplished by stirring
up the affair by discussing it. I think
Fitz looks at the matter in a reasonable
light and will in a few days announce his
willingness to stand by the rules. Of
course, it is not in my province to dic
tate fust what rules shall govern the con
test unless tbe principals fail to reach an
understanding. For all I know they may
both decide to bar tbe clinch blow, and in
that event I would have nought to do but
to agree, too, and see that they lived up to
their agreement. But, don't you see, a
violation of .hat understanding wouid be
a foul, and it micht occur in the first round.
You can readily imagine what a howl
would go up from the spectators if I should
decide against either man in the begin
ning of the contest on a technicality, and
yet I would only be doing my duty. It is
on this very account that I wish both
men to enjoy the widest latitude
so far as mattery of this
kind are concerned, thus lessening the
possibility of fouis, squabbles and all
around dissatisfaction. Thousands upon
thousands of dollars will depend upon
my decision, and I want my task made
easy as possible. I want to see a fair and
square contest to a finish and to see the
bett man wiri."
Corbett is not mc ined to express him
self in anything like & pronounced way
regarding Fitzsimmons' decree. He seems
to doubt the Cornishman's sincerity.
"I propose to keep right on practicing
the clinch work," he said to-day, with a
significant smile. "Fiiz need not think
he can jolly mÂ« into easing up in the least
I will go into tbe ring x repured to fight
under any and all rules, and I euess you
will tind that the regular Marquis of
Queenst>erry rules will prevail."
The Californian had his first bout this
morning with Jeffries, the Dusky Los
Angeles youth, who joined the Jratners'
ranks yesterday. They exchanged some
heavy blows, but still neither of them
essayed to extend himself to the limit.
They are not well enough acquainted as
yet for that
But nevertheless it was a rattling bout,
and Jeffries' work pleased Corbett im
mensely. He announced that he had at
last found somebody who he thought
could treat him to the sort of give-and
take bouts necessary in a pugilist's train
ing.
"He is as strong as a young lion," said
Jim, "and is one of tbe most willing lads
I ever sparred with. He is exactly my
height, and I think we are about even as
to reach. He is quiet, hits hard and is
quite ciever. I am satisfied that Jeffries
will prove a great help to me in my pre
paratory work. Of course, we hive not
loosened up yet, but we will be at each
other good and fast in the course of a
coupl* of days."
Apd- Jeffries is equally pleased with
Corbett. After the bout was over he told
me that the big fellow's wind was won
derful. Jeffries hes just gone through a
course of training himself, and naturally
exp'Cted to be able to bold out quite
awhile against Corbett.
But the latter completely wore him
out, and then went at Woods and Joe
CorDett. Jeffries expects to improve his
science greatly during his stay with Cor
bett, and admits that this, more than any
thing else, prompted him to accept the
offer to come here and assist in the big
fellow's training.
George Green, tbe well-known San Fran
cisco welter-weight, who is known pro
fessionally as "Young Corbett," because
it was the champion who rirst brought
him out, arrived nere this morning and is
now quartered at Shaws Springs along
with Corbett and his retinue.
George is matched to fight "Mysterious"
Billy Smith of Boston on the 16th of
March knd will do his training with his
old tntor. With Jeffries, Woods, Green
and Brother Joe to spar with daily, Corbett
will have no reason to complain of lack
of work in that line.
Then, big Jack McVey, the wrestler, has
recovered from his illness, and can re
sume his hugging bouts with the Cahfor
nian; Billy Delaney is on the ground to
attend to toe rubbing down and superin
tend matters generally, and Charley
White, the mm who u-ed to train Fitz,
will be here to-morrow to ioiu the ranks.
Besides all tiio-e, Al Hampton, the crack
San Francisco handball p. aver, arrived to
day to assist Jim in the court, and thus
take some or the work off Joe Corbett's
bands. So it will be seen that Corbett is
pretty well fixci so far as trainers are
concerned.
William A. Brady, Corbett's theatrical
partner and backer, is expected to arrive
here in the mornintr. It is said that Billy
bts a long aact and that he intends to pat
it all up on Corbett's chances.
The news from Dan Stuart's quarters
to-day is to the fact that be is recovering
from his attack of pneumonia very rapidly
and will be able to be out by Saturday.
The management of the Virginia nnd
Truckee Railroad had a large force of sur
veyors and track- layers out to-day build

THAT VIGEOS SHOOT.
trie S for U men Â».,m Here Will Enter
the Con'eit.
Dan Stuart, the sport promoter, has de
cided to give $1000 cash for a live bird pig
eon shooting tournament to be held in
Carson daring the week of the fistic fes
tival.
Stuart is figuring upon having a large
number of entries from the East, Jas there
are several hrst-claÂ«s professional pigeon
shooters living on the other side of the
mountains.
In. making a canvas among the noted
trap shooters of this City it was learned
that of the many very good shooters who
have established excellent records before
the traps not one man had deeded upon
I participating in the Carson shooting tour
| nament.
Otto Feu iner thought that prize-fight
ing and pigeon-shooting would* not travel
hand in hand, and as the whole thine was
purely a gambling scheme, he expected to
near of the trap-shooting vemure ending
in a dismal failure.
'"In iact, I don't expect to hear of any
of tue boys who reside in this City." laid
Feudner. "taking part in the festival, be
cause tiiose of them who may desire to
contest in the race for the big pot have not
the wherewithal to carry them throuch.
The expenses of the trip and the entrance
money, which is $")0, will deter many
from going, even though they may fancy
competing against the Eastern cracks."
Stuart i* not figurine upon having any
entries from this City, but he says that all
sportsmen are welcome and that the tour
nament will be open to all.

FRIDAY FKBKUARY 2t\ 1897
During the week ending Sat-
urday last THE CALL published
"3=SOO inches
of advertisements, which is
492 inches more
than was published by any other
San Francisco newspaper during
the same time.
Work on the new Federal building
should begin before summer.
The new Poatoffice we need, and the
new Postofficft we must have.
Every day we have some new reason for
rejoicing that the remaining days of Cleve
landi>m are few.
Bryan has been welcomed in Washing
ton and given a banquet, but all the name
he is a sideshow.
It seems well assured that San Pedro is
to pet the dee j -water harbor. Here's to
you, Los Angeles.
The powers seem to have interfered in
Crete, not so much to save it for Turkey
as to keep the Greeks from getting it.
The Senate has made another effort to
force Olney to action, but the effort was in
vain. Mr. Olney will not move until he
moves out.
It looks as if the administration had a
special apite against San Francisco and
held back the work on the new Posioffice
building to gratify it.
The design for the new Federal building
is not handsome, but the structure will
piease the people better when completed
fbau it does on paper.
The way to get a move on the officials at
Washington and start work on the Fed- i
era! building is to begin a movement here
and mate it energetic
The trouble with "yellow-dog journal
ism" is that it chases its own fake lail
around, instead of shewing a nose for
news and following the trail.
There would be work for a good many of
the unemployed if the Government would
expend the money which Congress has
appropriated for use in this City.
One of the merits of the boulevard
scheme is its ca; ability of indefinite ex
pansion. There is no telling how far it
will go when it once gets started.
The differences between Olney and Lee
renew the old eonte-t between the Puritan
and the cavalier, but fortunately both are
going out of office very soon and they will
not disturb the country long.
By energetic action we may bring about
the beginning of work on the Government
building in this City before spring is over,
and the result will amply repay all the
energy employed to attain it.
Before the powers venture upon the ex
p?riment of providing a government for
Crete under international supervision,
they had better make a new study of the
result of a similar experiment in Samoa.
The very fact that the Greeks are con
fronted in Crete not by the Turks but by
other powers is a proof that the Turkish
empire has virtually ceased to exist and
the territory is now in the hands of a
syndicate.
Ea-tern papers are announcing the re
appearance ot robins in their city parks,
just as if they had forgotten that such an
nouncements are almost equivalent to
â¢advertising for spring poetry and pre
cipitating the rush*.
People who wish to see old Egypt must
hurry up, for a new one is coming fast. A
concession has just been granted to a com
pany to run an electric road frotn Cairo to
the pyramids. The day of the donkey
boy will soon be over.
The Cleveland administration will tnrn
the affairs of the country over to Mc-
Kinley tangled up both at home and
abroad. The advance agent of prosperity
Wiil hava to whirl in and do a lot of house
cleaning and straightening up before he
can begin business.
Cleveland has managed to get one more
message to Congress condemning the pan
j-ionÂ» given to those who were wounded in
the war for the Union or to the widows ot
those who died. He seems 10 be under
tha impression that everybody ought to
have hired a substitute and let it go at
that.
The Democratic members of Congress
from California did not have influence
enough with the Democratic administra- j
tion to advance the construction of the
Federal build nÂ£ in this City, but we can
count on the Republican members to do
belter when AicKinley cornea in.
Because Senator Sherman denounced
the fake interview witb him published in
the Examiner as a lie, and sa*d the publica
tion of such statements in "sheer idiocy,"
it must not be supposed he is unfavorable
to the Cuban cause. He i< silent on the
subject now because of the fact that he is
soon to be Secretary of State, but his
record as chairman of tne Foreign Rela
tions Committee of the Senate shows what
his sentiments are.*
BEGIN THE WORK.
The only way to bring about an early beginning of the work of constructing the
new Federal building in thia City, for which an appropriation has long since been
made by Congress, is for tne people, through their Representatives, to enter at once
upon an earnest and determined agitation to that end. There is no hope of getting
anything from the present administration, which is now rapidly drawing to a close,
but we may accomplish something from the incoming administration if we are prompt
and emphatic in pressing our claims at this juncture.
Reports published in The Call yesterday of inierviews with the supervising archi
tect and with members of the California delegation in Congress show that there is
hardly any reason or even an excuse for the long delay which has been made in be
ginning the work. Congressman Maguire, who, beinc a Democrat, may be supposed
to know something of the motives of the Democratic officials, declares that he is sat
irfied that the Treasury Department has been for a long time determined not to com
mence the construction or the Posloffico under the present administration. If Mr.
Maeuire has been of this conviction for any length of time it it to be regretted that
he did not make it known earlier in order that popular pressure might have been
brought to force the Secretary of the Treasury to either commence the work or make
public bis reasons for reusing to do so.
Congressman Loud agrees with his colleague Maguire that the Treasury D part
ment has intentionally postponed the work and has been seeking excuses all along
for the delay. As Mr. Loud is a Republican he could have but little influence with
the present administration, and therefore he is not to blame for not more vigorously
pressing upon the Secretary of the Treasury the importance of the wort to San Fran
cisco and the urgent need of completing the building. A Republican admin stration,
however, will soon be in office, and we count upon Mr. Loud and other Republicans
in the California delegation to Be more active in urging the work than their Demo
cratic colleagues have been in the oast.
We must not, however, leave the whole work to our delegation In Washington.
There should be sent from this City petitions and representations of the strongest
kind from all associations acting for the business interests and industries of the City,
setting forth the need of the building for Federal uses and the importance of
beginning the work now in order to provide employment for the workingmen of the
City.
The agitation of the subject when once begun should be kept np continuously
until the end has been attained. We have had ample experience to show that as long
as we are indifferent the Government is likely to be equally so. The incoming admin
istration will have a great deal on its bands at the commencement of its terra of
office. It will naturally overlook the claims of San Francisco if they were not persist
ently urged upon the attention of its officials. That urging must be done by our
Board of Trade, Chamber of Commerce, Supervisors and citizens generally, as well as
by our delegation in Congress, and in order that it may be promptly effected prepara
tions for it should be undertaken at once.
Congressman L,oud declares that when a new Secretary is installed in the Treasury
Department he le6ls quite confident something can be done to promote the
worfe. In an interview with the representative of The Call he expressed the belief
that it may be possible to have the work under way by the middle of April. It is
certainly worth while working to that end, and if we do so with proper unity and
energy the hope may be realized.
The important point of the whole issue is for the people to comprehend that we
can attain nothing unless we work for it. Delay will Da prolonged upon one excuse
or another unless the people of Fan Francisco act with as much vim and vigor as do
the people of other cities who have equally large interests in Government appropria
tions. It must be borne in mind that since the appropriation was made for the
Federal building in this City money has been voted for buildings in other cities, and
these are now well advanced toward completion. To some extent, there
fore, we are to blame for not having our building before this. In a particular degree
the Democratic Senator and Democratic Congressman have been guilty of neglect in
not exerting more of that influence which they necessarily had with the Democratic
administration, and it behooves Republican delegates in Congress to show more dili
gence and zeal than was shown by tbtir Democratic colleagues.
San Francisco needi the building, her workingmen need the labor which its con
struction will give. Let us then unitedly work together to realize the promise con
tained in the words of Congressman Loud and see the construction begun before the
beginning of summer.
THE COONEY CASE,
We publish this morning a correction
by Judge Cook of certain misrepresenta
tions made of his recent charge and in
structions to the Grand Jury in the
Cooney case; and while interest in that
case is now largely discounted by the fact
that the real merits of the controversy over
the "pencil deeds" in the Fair estate liti
gation are to be fully brought out and set
tled by the civil suit which begins before
Judge Slack on Monday, the explanation of
Judge Cook should be carefully read by all
who wish a clear and exact understand
ing of the situation as it now stands.
It had been stated that in his charge to
the Grand Jury Judge Cook alluded to
certain certificates which had been printed j
at the suggestion of counsel in a collateral I
case and had reflected upon the conduct ;
of the counsel in having the work done, j
Having had hii attention call*d to these
misrepresentaiions or misconstructions of
his charge. Judge Cook emphatically re
pudiated them, and as will be seen by our ,
report this morning, declared that such an ,
idea wa< furthest from his mind when he
wrote and filed his instructions to the
jury.
With this incident closed, the Cooney |
ca c gives way in public interest to the
suit which begins on Monday, in which
the whole controversy wiil be tried on its '
merits and the facts involved in thÂ« issue
fully sat forth. As a matter of fact the
criminal charge against Cooney should
never have been brought at all while the
civil suit was pending. If the evidence in
the civil proceedings shows any illegal
acts on either aide it will then be time
enough to take steps for the prosecution
of the guilty pa'ties. The officers of the
law in this instance seem to have been
overzealous, for it Is clearly against pub
lic policy that civil suits should be fore
stalled by proceedings which are calcu
lated to prejudice the public mind against
one of the parties, and thereby endanger
the causn of impartial justice.
As the civil suit which is to test the
validity of the so-called "pencil deeds" is
now about to be taken up there is no rea
son why the public should be pnt to any
further expense in prosecuting the charges
against Notary Cooney. Every particle of
evidence concerning the deeds and all
other points of pertinence to the issue |
will be brought out in the testimony to be '
given during the civil trial. The Grand !
Jury will then have ample evidence on <
which to bane its conclusion. If it under
takes a separate investigation it will entail
a considerable cost upon the County with
out gaining any compensating advantage
or conferring any benefit either upon the
people or upon the cause of justice.
SAN PEDRO HARBOR.
Information published in Thx Call
yesterday gives ample ground for believ
ing that the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners appointed by the Government to
select a site for a ueep-water harbor for
Southern California has agreed to report
in favor of San Pedro. This is the first
reiiable information on the subject that
bas been given to the people, and was re
ceived with no little gratification. It
gives a fair assurance of another triumph
over the monopoly which has so long
dominated the State, and promises for
Los Angeles and Southern California gen
erally a deep seaport which will be open
for free commerce and in no wise subject
to monopoly control.
It may be home little time before the
official report of the Commissioner* is
made. It appears thai the findings of the
board have not yet been formulated, but
enough is known to make it sure that the
majority will be in favor of the harbor
which has been supported all along by
Los Angeles and the people of the State
generally. It Is said that no less than
four of the Commissioners favor San
Pedro, and that or.ly one is in opposition.
The victory for San Pedro is therefore a
most decided one and ought to settle any
doubts which may have existed in the
minds of tue public concerning the com
parative fitness of the two ports for the
proposed harbor.
Under the act of Congress providing for
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1897.
the construction of a harbor, tho sum of
$3,000,000 has been appropriated for the
work. An ample sum is ready for an
early beginning ot the ent-rprise, and it is
not too much to expect that before long
the great undertaking will be under way
and Los Angeles and San Pedro will be
receiving the benefit of the money put
imo circulation.
The result is one of which the people
of the State may well b<j congratulated.
Los Angeles has long needed a deep-watur
harbor, but the benefit will not be for thnt
city alone. All California will in a
measure profit by It. It will be of advan
tage to a!l our coast commerce, and wiil
help materially to build up the prosperity
of ti e State. There is nothing now to
wait for except the official report of the
commissioners and the decision of the
Government to begin the work. These
thing* will probably not be long delayed.
We are to have a business administration
in office in a few days and can rely upon
that administration to act promptly in
carrying out every undertaking that prom
ises to advance the pub ie welfare.
THE LAST BLOW.
Cleveland has taken advantage of a bill
granting a pension to the widow of a vol
unteer soldier of me war to send to Con
gress a message vetoing the bill, in which
he sets forth once more his hostility to
the pension t-ystem. The remaining days
of his term of office are lew, but hi; feel
ings would not permit him to let the occa
sion pass for getting in one more attack:
upon the pensions which a grateful repub
lic pays to the soldiers who were di-ab.ed
in its service and to the widows and
orphans of those who fell.
There is nothing in t c message which
differs in any decree from what he has
stated in former messages of a tim.lnr
nature. It was only another evidence of
antagonism to the soldier element of the
community, another proof of his Jack of
patriotic feeling and another manifesta
tion of his hostility to that sentiment of
the people which favors liberal pensions
to every disabled soldier of the war and to
every needy widow of one of those who
gave their iives that the Union might be
saved. Cleveland can never forget that he
served in the army only by a substitute,
that he evaded the duty imposed upon
patriots by the stress or war and that
whenever he has oeen a candidate for
office the veterans of the army of the
Union have been ODposed to him.
As Mr. Cleveland will soon be out of
office tnis last attack will count for little.
WÂ« shall aoon have in the White House a
President who was a brave soldier when
the country called for volunteers and
whose patriotism is attested not merely by
his statesmanship in Coneress, but by his
valor on the field of battle. When he is
President the soldiers will have a comrade
in office and the people will have a true
representative to show forth tlieir love
and loyalty to the defenders of the Union.
This being so the message will not serious
ly disturb the public mind. It will have
no other effect than that of arousing once
more public irritation against the man
who fougb: by substitute and ihen turned
his back upon the man who tcok his place
in the ranks. It was a mean blow, but
fortunately for the country it was not
only as futile at it was mean, but it is the
last one from Grover Cleveland.
OLNEY AND LEE.
The effort of the friends of the admin
istration to break the force of the state
ments made by Consul-General Lee con
cerning the condition of affairs in Cuba
by charging him with "playing to the
gallery" in order to win popnlar favor
will hardly prove successful. The people
of the United States are well aware that
the truth of the statements made by Lee
has been amply confirmed by other au
thorities. Representatives of the press of
all shades of opinion have made public
the facis on which the Consul-General
bases his conclusion, and so far from ex
aggerating the condition of affairs in
Havana, General Lee seemt to have been
unduly reticent concerning them.
'llie ccarge that Lee ii "playing to the
gallery" is further vitiated by the fact
that the reports of the Consul-General
have not been made directly to the people,
nor in a way to attract pnblic attention,
but have been sent in sealed documents
through the usual official channels to the
Secretary of State, It wae not until these
representations made to the State Depart
ment had been long ignored that General
Lee made any statement direct to the
press at all. Even in what be has now said
to the public there is nothing which in
any way exceeds what was before well
known from reports of reliable men liv
ing in Havana either as correspondents of
the press or as merchants doing business
there.
This being the condition of the contro
versy between the Secretary oÂ» State and
the Consul-General, the American people
will not hesitate to side with General Lee
lv the position he has taken. Nor will
they be inattentive to what he has to say
concerning the treatment of Americans
in Havana. They are aware that be went
to Cuba unprejudiced, and is both by
training and character well fitted to act
with discretion, observe accurately and
decide honestly concerning what he saw.
This is what General Lee said to a corre
spondent of the New York Times:
From the moment I landed my American
blood began to boil, and if I stay here much
longer and am forced to witness the indigni
ties heaped upon my countrymen without
cause it will literally boll away. They trample
on our flag aad hiss us on the streets. Amer
icans are murdered and imprisoned, indigni
ties are heaped upon our women and every
atrocity conceivable for a Spaniard to put on
Americans is thrust upon us.
These words, will have weight with the
Ameiican people. They are not to bo set
aside by the statement that the Consul-
General is making a Did for popular favor.
They will have influence in determining
the sentiments of all patriotic citizens
throughout thÂ« country. They will have
their effect upon the mass-meeting soon
to be held in this City. They will con
firm the popular judgmentâ that it will
be well Tor the United States when the
Cleveland administration is over and Mr.
OJney goes out of office.

THE HAND THAT RULES THE WORLD
It the hand "that rocks the cradle," and the world's interest in woman's benefactions to the
human rac? never flags.
Some of the noble achievement! of the good and brave women of our day will be exploited
in The Sunday Call.
"The Sunday Call wi'l not introduce its
reeders to a study of criminality.
it will not dig in the moral muck and filth
of the world for carrion to Driuf* into the
homes of the people on Sunday morning.
ItwJH not haunt the social backstairs for
nursery gossip of society women and their
children.
It wiil not take for granted that its readers
desire, above all things, even mental associa
tion with busband-pojsoners, woman house
breakers and remarkable girl criminals.
In short, it will not assume that San Fran
clfco desires to "eat its peck of dirt" from off
the pages of its Sunday paper.
Whether we wander by stream or lake, or
climbwith lithe eagerness the pine-clad hill-
Bide, or meander with the windings of the wood
land path, glorious nature forever asserts her
supremacy over our affections.
Byron in his passionate love of nature, by
tho deep sea or in the pathless wood found,
rest from the many things that jarred with
his supersensitive nature and fresh inspira
tion for immortal verse.
Always fresh, beautiful and comforting
nature soothes our wounds and rests the weary brain and mind and roul.
But, alts! for the exigencies of modern lite and the dwellers in the midst of citlas, we can
not all resort to nature directly at all times and soothe our wounds with her never-falling
balms and simple*.
Thanks to the naturalist at large, you can always taste of the sweets of our mountain
and vale, lake and river, and enjoy the glories of each recurring season, in some measure, at
least, and next Sunday you shall have the pleasure of hearing the notes of California's sweet
songsters and may form an acquaintance with the mischievous goldfinch, the soft trilling
thrush and other feathered denizens of wood and glen.
Another enchantrefs, who steals us away from the noisy hum of industry and the carklng
cares of everyday life, is Olive Heyden, author of many a delightful California idyl, both in
prose and verse.
This writer hag given In her happiest rein a true California storyâ a mining romanceâ for
the readers of The Sunday Call, and you cannot fail to en jiy it.
All arr interested in the alleviation of the woes of humanity, of which blindness is In a
sense the worst
Alas! what misery to grope one's way through life and never look upon the face of nature

John Bonner will have in TnE Stnday Call a most interesting article on the blind and
how their hitherto pitiful disabilities are overcome by the kind and wondrous intervention
of science.
The practicability of the motor cycle has been exploited till it has entered the field of
things belonging no longer to the wonderful, and its latest development exposes it as a genu
ine enemy of the bicycle, threatening to drive out the bike, as the bike has done the horse.
Such is the rapidity of modern enterprises that the motor cycle has already fallen within
the ken of the non-luxury-buying public, and It is possible that the reign of the bicycle is near
an end.
But The Sunday Call will give you the whole story.
Home inventions, like home industries, are, as is proper and just, of live interest to our
readers.
There are two important inventions now on the tapiÂ», both of California origin, and one
of them may offset the motor-car bogy, for it is an auto-bike, driven by gasoline.
No more weary climbing up stiff grades, for this bike will bear you in comfort up the
highest of them.
Read about it in The Call on Sunday.
The children will be charmed as usual.
Waldron W. Anderson will have a poem on the page which is devoted to our darlings,
which reminds us in a way of that dear friend of the little ones, the much loved and deeply
mourned Eugene Field.
The fashion page of The Sunday Call will be, as usual, a faithful record of passing events
in the world of fashion, a true picture of the kaleidoscopic pageant.
Another feature of The Sunday Call will be a most romantic story giving a further exam
ple of the superior strangeness of truth ns compared to fiction.
This romance opens just after one of the great events of the war and culminates In San
Francisco at a dinner given quite recently by a gentleman to a select party of friends.

Letters From the People.
THE REVENUE PROBLEM.
With Declining Itnvortationa Under Low
tariff, What follow ?
To the Editor ff the San Francitco Callâ Sir:
It seems to me that the advocates of high
â¢tariff are face to face with a serious matter.
I regard the Bulletin of this City as good au
thority on revenue statistics. In the issue of
February 23 ihe column devoted to "Finance
tnd Trade" contains these figures on the
January foreign trade:
1896 897
Exports. ....;. ?86,970,028 f94.9M.067
Imports U8,t547,6J0 61.527.C81
$18,322,4*28 $43,636,986
With an extraordinary session of Congress
almost certain to be called in the near future
for the express purpose of materially increas
ing the U'ifl'on Imports, and with no douDt
in the pub ie mind that such increase will be
made, instead of a largo increase in importa
tions in order to take advantage of "free
trade" rates, as certain journHs are wont to
style tne present tariff, we find the rather
startling decrease of more than $17,000,000
in imports over January last year.
But I rind in the Bulletin of yesterday, Feb
ruary 24, financial department, the figures of
"the foreign trade of the United States for the
i first seven months of the current year" given
as follows:
1893-96 1896-97
Exports 964,969 $656,215,311
Imports 478.716,717 3b.s.str>l,oM)
$4t>.i*4f,'Jsv! *292,9tt4.i:31
We are only concerned here with the matter
of Imports, and we note that a year ago the
imports for the first seven months of th<- fiscal
year were 716,717, as against $303,251.
--030 the current riscnl year, a decrease of
$115,465,637, or $16,495,091 per month, the
January decrease beln^ $17,320,519, a consid
erable increase over the monthly average.
However, assuming .hat the Average decrease
for the fiscal year ending June 31) next will see
no chatwe in the average monthly decrease of
$10,495,091, the deÂ«rease In imports lor the
year will loot up to $197,941,092, almost two
hundred millions.
In the face of thfs enormous decrease in Im
portations of lorelgn goods under a low tariff,
or "free trade" as it was called throughout the
campaign by the supporters of Mai r Mi-Kiu
ley, It seems to me that if the tariff is greatly
increased the importations will be proportion
ately decreased, and heuce the revenues of the
Government will also be diminished. Of
course I understand that the schedule will b
adjuxted so as to increase trie tax on fsucb
articles of import as show the least decline,
but will not this prove to be articles In gen
eral uÂ»e by the great majority of the people,
and so will become an additional increase In
the cost of living for these peop'e? If so, gen
eral discontent will be sure to follow.
In this connection I should uot fail to call
attention to thÂ« fact that tne cheap produc
tion of steel rai s has made a market for 100,
--000 tons in Europe, ac-'ordine to the Bulletin,
which adds thai "witniu two years the United
States will do a tremendous exp-irt business in
steel rails." It wi Ibe useless, then, to place a
tariff on imported steel rails, and yet the
revenue derived from this line of imports in
recent years was a large item, and this item
must now be deducted.
It way be possible for the Incoming admin
istration to frame a tariff wnich will raise suf
ficient revenue lor current expenses and in
terest on our increased Government debt, but
it will not be an easy task. In tact, it begins
to appear to n good many business men, who
seem singularly Flow to learn, that there is
something wrong with the country besides
the tariff. However, it has been some time
since 1 have heard one of these wise business
men say that over-production was the cause of
commercial and industrial depression, which
shows that they can learn eveu if they are
slow, for it is to be remembered that for along
time ''over-prnductlon" was the all-sufficient
explanation offered by these meu lor our hard
times.
Singular as it may seem, it is nevertheless
true that there ore not a few of these same
business men who will now boldly say that
our dull times are flue to underconsumption,
because the reop c are generally poor and can
not purchase goods as they always did till our
bad time* came. I shail not be surprised II
these same meu should soon begin to inquire
with an honest desire to learn wny it is the
people are so poor when crops have not failed
and no pesti'.encc has swept the land or war
disturbed the pursuits of tne inhabitants.
buch inquiry will lead to the discovery that
the tariff has much less to do with present
conditions than is generally believed, and
they will further learn in a few months, un
less I misapprehend the situation, that there
will be something more me led than an in
crease of tariff to restore prosperity to our un
fortunate country.
Much ridicule has been heaped upon tho
Cleveland administration because the present
Wilson-Gorman tariff has failed to bring la
sufficient revenuf, tue past year especially.
W hile I have no desire to say a word to favor or
excuse the expiring administrationâ for which
I have no respect whateverâ at the same time
it must be seen at a glance that if the imports
nad not decreased so enormously the past
seven months ihere would be no deficit bui
a surplus in the treasury. Can the incoming
administration insure imports equal to the
last year under a high tariff ?

HOW I-RYu RESEMBLES CALHOUN
Louisville Courier-Journal.
The other day I walked into the Senate gal
lery and found that the roll was being callei
on the question of considering Morse's liquor
bill. Frye was in the chair and while Harri*.
Hill and Aldrich all know more about parlia
mentary law than Frye he is the best presiding
ollicar the Seuate has known since John c.
Brecklnridge. Frye follows the rule of Cai
tioun, perhaps the greatest presidi g officer in
the history of the Senate, not excepting even
Aaron Burr.
Calhoun would not permit one Senator to
refer to another Senator as "my friend lrom
Virginia." or as "the gentleman Ircm Massa
chusetts." The correct phraEe was "the Sena
tor from Virginia" or "the Senator from Mass- \
achusetu." It is said that it was worth a W
journey across the continent to hear Calhoun *
announce a vote in the Senate. There was
more of the Roman in nis look than in any
other public mau of our history. His eyes
burned like coals of fire and there was dignity
enthroned in every lineament and movement.
When Calhoun aunounced a vote he said in a
voice that penetrated the furthermost recesses
of the chamber: "Senators, on this question
the ayes are â and the nays are â . Tne ayes
huyo it, and the motion is (.greed to."
Frye is the only man I have ever seen pre
side over the Senate who announces a vota
with that impressiveness we can imagine Cal
houn employed, and it is doubtful if even Cal
houn could utter the word Senators with more
rotundity than Frye gives it.

POLICE RAID ON
A FENCE'S HOUSE
Two Men and Three
Women Are Placed
Under Arrest.
The Men Will Be Charged With
Committing Several Burg
laries.
Skeleton K?ys, Picklccks and Stol n
Property Found by iha Police
in the House.
An important capture has been made by
the police. Two notorious burglars and
three women who were utilized by them to
sell the plunder are in custody.
It has been suspected by the police for
some time that the house at 243 Tehama
street, occupied by Mrs. Frawley and her
family, was a resort of burglars, and it
was dete:mined to keep a watch upon the
place.
Policemen T, L. Ryan and Ed ODea
have the credit of discovering the resort
and with the assistance of two other ol
ficers of making the successful capture.
1 hey located the place last Monday and
on Wednesday night detormined to raid
it, securing the assistance of Policemen
O'Keefe and Koegel.
Ryan posted him-elf in front of the
house, Koegel and O'Keeffe were stationed
in the alley svay that runs along the side of
the houÂ«e and ODea took a position in the
rear. When ail was in readiness Ryan
knocked ai the front door, which was a
signal to the others, and when it was
opened be rushed inside. Two men, Wil
liam Warden and Charles Harper, jumped
out of a rear window and ODea tackled
them.
0 Keefe and Koegel rushed to his assist
ance, and they were soon joined by Ryan.
The two men fought desperately, particu
larly Warden, and they were helped by
Mattie Frawley, one c Mrs. Frawley's
daughters, Elizabeth Keane, an ex-con
vict, and Rosie Harper. The women tore
at the officers' hair and in every way tried
to get the two men out of their clutches.
The officers had to use their clubs freely
upon Warden and Harper before they
were subdued.
The two men and three women were
taken to the Southern station, and later
to the City Prison.
The house was then searched, and a gold
watch, a silver watch, two gold-plated
chains, a revolver ana charm, four silver
taps, four syringe*, a cupping machine, a
siiver-plated cover of a sugar bowl, a
music rack and two priers, the proceeds ot
burglaries, were found.
Four skeleton keys were found in the
room that Warden occupied and two pick
locks were found in the Kitchen. These
had been used by the men in committing
burglaries.
E. J. Deniston's silver-plating works
at G53 Mission street were entered oa
FeLruary i 9 and five teapots, a cream
puchei, thirteen teaspoons, eleven table
spoons, two forks, two gray-handled
knives, a hand satchel, two bar spoons
ami a napkin ring were stolen. An at
tempt had also b<>en made to break open
the safe but had been unsuccessful.
The following night ttie second-hand
store of Mrs. Tittenbaum, 213 Third Btreet,
was entered and thirteen watcher, four
opera glasses, a revolver, a capping
machine, four syringes and four silver taps
were stolen.
The n xt night the shop of J. Rein
hardt, 673 Mission street, was entered and
four pr.ers, a revolver and a fur cape were
stolen.
Besides the articles recovered at 248
Tehama street, Ryan and ODea recovered
the following articles which had been sold
by Mattie Frawley:
From James Deane, 334J^ Fremont
street, a silver wutcli stolen from Mrs.
Tittenbaum ; from Joseph Welsh, 35 Clara
street, a silver watch stolen from Mr-.
Tittenbaum; from Phillip Christenson,
saloon-keeper, 343 Mission jstreet, a re
volver stolen from Deniston's plating
works; from W. Fabla, 1020 Folsom
street, four silver-plaied teapot*, a pitcher,
and a napkin ring stolen from Deniston's;
f'om Sam Baur, 1146 Folsom street, two
silver-plated knives and fortes Ptolen from
Daniston's; from JobnO'Brlen, 1136 Folsom
street, a silver watch Btolen from Mrs.
Tittenbaum.
Ryan and ODea have also recovered the
fur cape stolen from Rein hart's shop, G73
Mission street, and expect to be able to
recover ihe remainder of the stolen prop
erty.
Charges of burglary will be entered
against Warden snd Harper. Mattie
Frawley, who was the recognized "fence,"
will be charged with receiving stolen
goods and the other two women with va
grancy. The reÂ«l name of Elizabeth
Keane is L zzle Valentine. She in 1884
was sent to the State prison for five years
for robbing a man.
Roiie Harper is a daughter of Mrs.
Frawley, and Warper, the Durglar, is her
husband. The mother and another
daughter have not been arrested, as there
ii no evidence so far to connect them with
tbo gang, but the police believe they were
all equally culpable. Mrs. Frawley, how
ever, declares that she is an bones;, hard
working woman, and has done her best to
raise her daughters as good, honest
women.
Warden, although denying 'that be was
ever arrested before, is believed to be an
ex convict. He remarked to the police
that he had tried for some time to lead nn
honest life, but had failed. He has ths
appearance of an "opium â  fiend." He is
'i~ years of ace and says he was born in
Vallej'j. Harper Is 88 years of age and
the police so far know nothing of his past
record.
Ryan and ODea think they will be able
to trace other burglaries to Warden and
Harper, and lor that reason the prisoners
bare not yet been charged.
Mass-Meeting of Laborer*.
A meeting held la-t evening under the
auspices or the California State Labor
Convention tilled the big Auditorium.
There was music, some good speeches and
a set of resolutions. The speakers were
caustic in their criticisms of the law

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 26. 1897.
Those Who Figured Most Prominently in the Raid on the " Fence " House.
WAR AMONG THE
DOG FANCIERS
The San Francisco Ken
nel Club Gets the
Sanction.
Boycott Declared on the New
Organization by the St
Bernard Ciub.
Many Local Fanciers Will Support the
Alameda Sportsmen's Associa
tion Suow.
The receipt by a well-known dog fancier
of this City of a telegram from James I
Mortimer of New York, announcing that !
the newly formed San Francisco kennel j
club had been recognized as the member
of the American Kennel Club in this City,
has raise! a storm in dog circles that
threatens to stir them up very lively.
The telegram was first made known at a
meeting of the St. Bernard Club on
Wednesday evening. It had been re
quested by a member of the ciub that
Mr. Mortimer, who was the delegate of
the defunct Pacific Kennel Club to the
American Kennel Club, telegraph the de
cision of the latter body as soon as made.
The telegram was no sooner read than
a member offered a motion that the St.
Bernard Club exhibit nodogs at the >liows
of the ban Francisco Club. This measure
was passed with but few dissenting votes,
and J. ii. Martin, one of the Jaigest fox
terrier exhibitors in this City, who was
present, stated that be also would refuse
to send his dogs to the San Francisco
Club's shows, and suggested that the
Alameda Sportsmen's Association be in
duced to give a show. He said that if the
association would do so he would send his
docs there and also subscribe $20 toward
defraying the expenses of tlie ciab.
The idea teemed to strike the assembly
in a favorable light, and within a few
moments $100 was subscribed by the
fanciers present.
Messrs. Prather and Miller, who were
present to represent the Alameda Sports
men* Association, stated that they bad
no doubt that the association, with this
enthusiastic support, wou.d give a show
and a successful one. The contents of
the telegram did not greatly disappoint
the raombers of the Olympic Gun Club,
which had applied tor membership in the
American Kennel Club in opposition to
the San Francisco Club.
When the Pacific Kennel Club disband
ed, the funds then in the treasury were a
source of uneasiness to the director-, who
feared that trouble might arise as to their
disposition. The members who went over
to ti e Olympic Gun Club constituting*
majority of the directors of the dissolving
club, decided that as the iunds were those
of a kennel club they should be used for
kennel club purposes.
It was, therefore, decided to turn them
over to the gun club for the purpose of
giving a sbow, and only one show, pro
vided, of course that the sanction of the
American Kennel Culb was received.
Profits, if any, were to be divided among
the lour orphan asylums of this City. In
case the sanction was not received the
money on hand was to be given to the
cuaritieti mentioned.
lip; refusal of the sanction makes the
money available at once, and within a few
days the fund* will be divided according
to the plan described.
Tbo<e who composed a majority of the
defunct Pacific Kennel Club feel very bit
ter toward the element that disrupted the
organization and claim that the new or
ganzation was formed 07 this element.
They will not show their dogs at the
San Francisco Club's show, but will join
witn the Bt. Bernard Club in supporting
the Alameda sportsmen. A fight within
a fight is expected to develop, from the
fact that some members of the St. Bernard
Club are not in accord with the majority
in its boycott of the San Francisco Club,
so tbat a merry time is expected all
around.
It is expected that the official announce
ment of the appointment uf the San Fran
ci co Kennel Club as the representative of
the American Kennel Club in this City
will be received from Secretary A. V.
Vredenbureh within a few days.
VAENEY GASKILL ACCUSED.
Bad Faith on His Part Alleged by the
Alliance Insurance Company.
The Alliance Assurance Company of
London has instituted a peculiar suit
against Varney \Y. Gaskill, John D.
Richards and Carl A. Henry. The com
plaint alleges that Gaskill was formerly
employed by the Alliance Assurance
Company, and while so emrloved made a
memoranda of all the outstanding risks or
policies for tire insurance of the
said company, and that after leaving
the company be associated himself
with Richards & Henry, delivering to
them the memoranda of the assurance
company's business in order that Rich
ards &, Henry, together with Gaskill, may
get the business for themselves.
It is asserted that it is usual for persons
to renew their policies in the same com
pany with which they cave been doing
business, and that thiÂ» would be the
natural course for the patrons of the as
surance company, but that the defend
ants will interfere with and injure the
company's business and patronage unless
they are compelled to surrender the
memoranda obtained by Gaskill, which it
is plleged ought to be regarded as the pe
culiar property of the assurance company.
The plaintiff asks for a decree to com*
pel the defendants, Gaskiil. Richards and
Henry, to deiver up for cancellation the
said memoranda, and that the defendants
be forever enjoined from using the same,
and for such other relief ss may be equita
ble. Vanness & Redman are attorneys for
the plaintiff.
ROMANCE HAD CHARMS.
Charlotte Gruenhagen and John
Gwynn Married in San
Jose.
The Brife Returned to H?r Parents

San Jose has again witnessed a secret
tnarriaee. In this case two of San Fran

Gwynn, a young man interested in
Mexico's mine?, are the contracting
parties.
Mr. Gwynn and bi3 young wife met in
this City several years ago. They are
both ardent students of music, ana their
mutual love of harmony was the means of
Drinking them together quite often. About
a year ago, according to the young wife,
they became engaged, but, without appar
ent reason, decided to keep the betrothal
a secret. Mr. Gwynn finally decided to
seek wealth in the m net of Mexico.

The Mayor's committee to devise ways

nently and arrange for a mass-meeting at

President Jones and Secretary Mas

the past week and have received numer
ous ardent letters expressing goodwill to
ward Cuba ana the movement, and ex-'
tending sympathy as well as moral and
financial support.
It will be Been at a glance that those en

: It is the general sense of the committee
that a mass-meeting ought to be called at
an early date to tuke action on tbe Cuban
question, so as to put this coast on record
as in line with New York and as sincerely
in favor of any righteous movement for
liberty, particularly on this hemisphere.
"We â have had promises of many
speeches," said Secretary Mascherini yes
terday, "and we expect to be able to add
Samuel M. Sbortridge to the list as one of
the principal speakers. His voice has
been heard for liberty so often that it
would be a good idea to have him as one
| of the principal speakers at the mass
meeting." :
"The mails bring new discussions of the
Cuban question each day," said President
Jones yesterday, "and some of our corre
spondents run to poetry."
There is great diversity of opinion
among the various friends of Cuba as to
the best way to aid her, but the prevailing
council in the ranks of adderea ts is that a
middle course ought to be pursued in. the
deliberations of the meetings. Some are
for urging that this Government . take
active measures, while others favor non-
interference; bat the platform on which
all can stand advocates that American
citizens extend to Cuba their sympathy
and give her citizens the full benefit of
their moral support.

LIGHTS WANTED
AT LAKEVIEW.
Property- Holders Unite in
Preparing Their Pe
tition.
They Set Forth Well That the
Section Is Growing Very
Rapidly.
Supervisors Are Counted Upon to
S;e That Darkness Shall No
Lcnger Prevail.
A mass-meeting of property-owners and
residents of Lakeview and Ingieside Im
provement Club was held at Peraico's
Hall last night, at which William Corbin
presided.
The object of the meeting was to peti
tion the Board of Supervisors to place
from fifteen to twenty electric lights on
Ocean boulevard, from San Jose to Ingle
side, over a distance oi about three miles
of road, upon which there is not the faint
est glimmer of even a tallow candle during
the night.
In the absence of M. J. Donovan, the
chairman of tbe light committee ap
pointed by the club at a previous meeting,
Captain P. M. Clarkson of the committee
reported that he had interviewed Super
visor River?, the chairman of the L ght
Committee of the Supervisors, during tne
week, and from him had learned that it
would be impossible to eet licbts placed
on tbe boulevard before next July, when
I robably an appropriation wonld be made
sufficient to give the ol ub what it desired.
In the meantime he advised the commit
tee to petition the board for that purpose.
This was done by drafting the following
petition:
Lakeview, Cal., Jan. 9, 1897.
Dr. C. A. Clinton, Supervisor Eleventh Ward,
San Francisco, CaKâ Dear Sir: We, citizen*
and property-holders oi Lakeview, kindly ask
you to aid us lv securing electric-lights ior
this particular portion of the City. You, of
course, are aware oi the fact that we never
have bad a single light here, nor has the City
ever Â«pent a single cent in helping us.
This section of the City is growing very rap
idly, and would grow much mster if furnished
with a lew lignts. Tbe racetrack is situated in
this d. strict, and, as is true oi all racetracks,
has some very bad element that follows iv
Nightly it is damped upon us, and, owing to
no lights, tbe police are almost powerless to
cope with it. The remark made by gome one
that one good electric-light ia as good as a po
liceman is about correct.
To give us proper light it will require about
fifteen lights. Owing to the tact that electric
poles and ii*hts are within one block of us,
over the hill on the Ocean View side, the cost
oi putting In these lights wouid be very in
expensive.
We made a similar application to the Board
of Supervisors which has just retired from of
fice, but were toid, "No funds on hand."
We trust you can give us some immediate
relief, and thank you ior anticipated savors.
Tuis document received over 100 signa
tures at tne meeting, with more to be
ndded before iis presentation to the
board.
The light committee, which consisted of
M. J. Donovan, H. J. Knight and Captain
P. M. ClarKson, was enlarged by adaing
President Corbin and C. B. Kitch. The
latter, who is connected with the Market
street Railroad Company, made an ad
dress urgine that lights should be placed
on the boulevard.
Captain Clar&son also spoke of the
necessity of d tter protection against fires.
Patrick Harrington and others advo
cated immediate action for tbe betterment
of the Inglcside and Lakeview district in
which there is over $75,000 worth of prop- j
erty wholly unprotected.

IMP. IVY WON AT
ODDS OF 100 TO 1
A Reversal of Form That
Gave Bettors a
Shock.
Tuesday the Mare Was Beaten
by a Cheap Lot of
Platers.
Salvable Again Scores With Ease
Clissie B First at 12 to IâFore
most Again in Good Shape-
On Tuesday last the Anstralian-bred
mare Ivy, when ridden by "Skeets" Mar
tin, finished behind such ordinary per
formers as Chappie, Roy Caruthers, So
niro and others in a live and a half fur-
Jong scramble, won by Morven. Yester
day she came out in the opening mile
dash at Ingleside, and with as good ad 100
to 1 obtainable against her in the books
beat such company as Peter the Secoi.d,
Logan and Yankee Doodie. On tne occa
sion, of her previous bad showing the mare
was heavily played, yet the odds drifted
back from 3}Â£ to sto L Martin gave as
an excuse for the poor ride iurnisbed that
he bad been bumped several times, and
hard as he tried to persevere with his
mount the mare would not try. In yes
terday's run Piggott piloted the Antipo
dean.
In the betting Yankee Doodle opened a
2 to 5 choice, but on a report gaining cre
dence that be was "short" the educated
money went on Logan. The latter and
the odds-on favorite traveled in clo*e com
pany to tt.e bend for home, where Piggoit,
on Ivy, slipped through next the rail and,
although tiring at the end, downed Peter
the Second a head in the slow time of
1:43' 3 . Logan secured the show.
Tne climatic conditions were perfect for
racing, and another Jarge crowd visited
the track. Barring one or two dumps,
the talent fared very well, though but two
pronounced choices did win, the majority
of the horses that crossed the line hrst
carrying more or less support.
In the mile and a sixteenth purse event
there were but five starters, with Tat
Dunne's good colt Salvable going to tne
poÂ»t an S to 5 choice, though at one time
3 to 1 was obtainable. From sixes the
Baldwin entry, Argentina, was piayed
down to Hi to 5. At the post Greyhurst,
Bnuna and Argentina caused considerable
delay by tneir unruly actions. When
finally sent away Greynurst, with Suisun
at his head, sailed out in lront at a te rrific
clip, fairly losing the others. When the
stretch was reached both began tiring, and
I\i;.rti::, on BaJvaUie, making his move,
came on and won easily from Argeniiua
by less than a length in i'AS%.
The finisn of the third race aawClissie B,
Woodchopper and Meadow Lark pass the
wire noses apart in the order named.
Clissie B and Woodcuopper alternated in
making the running to the stretch, w:.ere
the duo were joined by Meadow Lark and
a lint drive ensued. Barrirtgton on Clisaie
H fairly outdid himself, riding like a ve:
eran and getting the verdict. The 13 to 10
lnvorite Olive was away poorly ana never
cut any figure in the tunning.
With Midlo scratched old Yemen with
T. 61oan up was backed down from 8 to 5
and 9 to 10 favoritism and the chestnut
did the trick very cleverly. Sloan look
the lead from Jack-o'-Lantern at the first
jump, and traveling at an easy pace led
Major Cook out by two lengths. Jack-o'-
Lantern received the show in a drive.
The iive-furlong d&sh that followed was
the medium of a big plunge on Salli^
Clicquot, which, opening at twos, Â»a
hamincred down to even money in a sec
ond. Celoso, which opened at 7 to 5, re
ceded half a point- Tne other starters re
ceived but slight consideration from spec

Oood fcian. Won e*Â«Uy. Winner, V. A. Honit't cb. b., by imp. ht. UiÃisc-ilÂ»snet:a TfWm.lMtlC
ulators. Away first at the start, Sloan on
Celoso avowed Rond warmer to lead ni.s
mount to the stretch, where he let out a
link, and at the wire won well in hand a
head in advance of the 30 to 1 ishoi Miss
Ross. The favorite, away rather poorly,
was a pood third.
Both the first and second choices went
down to defeat in the mile and a quarter
run, decided under selling conditions.
JMorte .Fonse was a consistent 2 to 1 fa
vorite in itc betting, with the wise coin
rising on ..ie cnances of Unity, which
horse opened at 2, reteded to 4 and was
then backed down to l.'Jtoo. Cherrystone
and Elmer F made mo*t of the running to
the stretch, where T. Sloan astride tne 6
to 1 shot Foremost cut looÂ«e and won at
the wire cleverly from Can't Dance, ridden,
by Tnorpe, also an outsider in the betting.
W ; ilie Martin's ride on Morte Fonse may
have been according to instructions, but
it appeared a very wishy-washy one.
For the first time since h:s breakdown
in the East some months ago, Dan Honiir's
great horse Magnet sported silk once
more, starting an even money etianoe for
the last pvent of the day, a five furlong
purse affair. He passed Fly and The
Dinner in the stretch as though they were
tied to nusts, and won in a big gallop in
1:02^. Fly was second, not quite a full
iengi.ii aoead of Dunboy.
NOTES.
Twenty bookmakers were doing busi
ness in the ring yesterday.
Joe Ullman laid 20 to 1 a place against
imp. Ivy and lost considerable to the race.
Secretary Leate denied emphatically
yesterday the statement made by E. J.
Emmons in the Legislature at Sacra
mento on Wednesday, as published in a
morning paper, to the effect that he had
been approached by one George McCalvey,
who, for a money consideration, offered to
suppress the Emmons racing bill, limit
ing rÂ«cing in each county to thirty days in
Â»i year. The article also staled mat Mr.
Leake and his friends intended to pro
duce affidavits to that effect before the
Legislature in an endeavor to crush the
bill. The Ingleside secretary wired Mr.
Emmons a complete refutation of the re
port yesterday.

HIS PLEA FOR THE
IRISH TENANT
Father McFadden Tells of
the Sorry Condition of
His Parishioners.
On Land Valued at 3 Cents an
Acre the Landlord Has
Grown Rich.
Twics Has the Patriot Priest B:en
Imprisoned for Protesting Against
Their Wrongs
Great interest is being manifested in the
farewell reception to be tendered to Rev.
Father James McFadden, the "patriot
priest of Gweedore, " at Metropolitan
Temple, on the evening of March 10.
Father McFadden has had a most stormy

Honor a Farewell Reception Will Be Given at Metropolitan
Temple on the Evening of March JO.
experience in his native land, being twice
imprisoned for his fearless championship
of an oppressed people.
On the first occasion, in 1888, he had
made an address in behalf of the poor
tenants who associated themselves to
gether to defend themselves against the
rapacity of the landlords. For this he
spent six months in jail. Upon his release
he went over to England and there made
protest against the oppression of the peo
ple.
Upon his return to his parish he was
welcomed by a public demonstration. He
made a speech. A policeman lying in a
ditch at a distance of several rods re
ported to the authorities wliat fee thought
he had beard. A summons was issued
for the police under a law against which
he had protested and he refused to re
spond to it. A warrant was issued, which
was served by an inspector ot police with
drawn sword at the church door when the
reverend father came from it on Sunday
morning surrounded by his people. The
peasants rushed to his assistance, believ
ing, from the rough manner of tue officer,
that he was beinc maltreated. In the
scrimmage the officer was killed. A reign
of terror in Gweedore followed.
Some twenty-two persons were arrested
with the prie3t, and the number increased
to 100 before the trial. Father McFadden
was tried not upon the original complulnt,
but lor the murder of the policeman.
Every effort was put forth to secure a con
viction. First the crown secured a change
ol venue; then a special jury of persons
having property valued at not less than
Â£100. and from ihrse, so careful was the
selection made, forty-two were required to
"stand aside." Still, such was the weight
of public opinion aroused everywhere,
that t!;e effort failed, and upon pleading
guilty to the simpie offense of interfering
with an pffioer he was linally dismissed.
Faiher McFadden has for yeais stood
between the oppressions of the landown
ers and his peasant people. He has been
a protesting witness to scores of evictions.
He has collected and distributed a.nong
the people us much as Â£oCOO to tide them
over in years wlen their barren lands
were unequal to the rent despite best
effor's and the strictest economy.
"When I realized that this was simply
i levying toll upon the generous for the
! benefit of the relentie-s landlord, is it any I
wonder I spoke plainly upon the sub
ject?" !>aid Father I>icFaclden in an inter
view last evening. "However, it has not
all been in vain, for 1 secured a reduction
ot 35 per cent in the rents as well as many
oilier betterments."
The mission of Father McFadden to
this country is to make an appeal and
quicken interest in behalf ot the op
pressed people i;mo:ig whom ho minis
ters. The hard tunes he Sound prevailing
hfre has militated against the success ol
his mission. Siill he nasdone something,
and hopes to do more. The reception at
Metropolitan Temple, it is expected, will
do much to advance his cause. It will
be an opportunity at leant to inform the
public upon conditions that are scarcely
understood an t difficult of helief.
"The area of Gw<>edore," said Father
McFad<ien last evening, "is aoout 44 000
acres, cf which 24,0JOare held by the Jand
loras in foe, so that about 20,000 are in
actual iccupatinn. of the tenants. The
population numbers 960 f.innlies, with an
average number of live and a half. The
gross valuation of the lands and improve
ments in occupation of tenants is Â£1283,
the valuation of tue land alone being but
Â£949 16s. The value of the portion of
*>ach laniily is thus less than Â£1.
"The average valuation oÂ» land in
Gweedore is only 7 pence. It is poor land,
you see, made up of black bog, brown
heather and grjy granite, a;hard unpro
ductive area but oeaatiful to loot upon.
The toil is nearly all of tue same type, a
shallow surface of wet bog, with the red
dish water lying in the hol.ows resting on
a floor of granite. Yet over the poor
product of this land there has been Ruing
on a fierce struggle for forty years between
landlord and tenant. In that time the
latter have seen the rise of and
been cursed by the Jar.d specu
lator â whu has grown rich while the
country is dotted with the heaps of stones
ihat mark the trail of the evicting land
lord. In its prairie or natural stateâ the
state in which it was handed over
by landlords to the original tenant
in title â its value per acre is only
3 cents. One acre oi the rich land of
Meath is worth forty acres here and the
cultivation of the Gweedore holding, if
done by hired labor, would be 4000 times
as expensive as the cultivation of the one
acre in Me.uh. A few mcaeer black and
white sheep and gaunt red cattle get a
scanty living out of the narrow strips of
pasturage that lie between the bog Holes,
and somehow or other the industry of the
peasant has contrived to raise from ihis
worst of land potatoes and oats for food
and fodder and stones for the building of
his thatched hovpj with its earthern floor.
"I don't think there are twenty hold
ings in Gweeuore that pay the rent and
support tue families living In them. The
money paid to the landlord represent* the
! savings of the returned miner and farmer
from America and Australia and of the
factory and 1 arresting work of the men
who go into other districts ot Ireland and
Great Britain. Eight landlords dispose of
the people of Gweedore and they represent,
either in th<Ur own persons cr those of
their predecessors a monumental system
of robbery. They havo sucked the tenant
dry of whatever revenue he might have,
even to the contributions of cnarity in the
sum of Â£5000 Â»â¢ cured throucb my efforts
as 1 have explained.
"Or.c of the landlords declared at one of
the inquiries instituted that the people
'could n-.ake a living out of the kelp.' He
said nothing about the land. Some of the
crudest cases of eviction on this same
man's estates were those of returned
American*, after they had sunk Â£200 or
Â£300 in the land. Every improvement on
u.ese lands that nas abided value to the
original 3 cents an acre is the work of the
tenant. But for all this toi! it was always
the Â£10 or Â£15 earned at day labor in a
foreign land out of which tne landlord
obtained hi? rent. The bailiff used to be
in the houses within a f"W hours of the
laborers' return in the fall, and before he
had completed his rounds had taken up
the bent portion of (he money they had
broncht with ihem.
"In distress years or when there was a
death in the famiiy these poor creaiures
would write their English employer ask
ing the loan of a pound cr two, promising
to work it out next toarvest-time. Thus
they were compelled to mortgage their
bodies to pay the landlord iheir uttermost
farthing. Within forty years these people
have been changed from a pastoral com
munity, associated in town land*, paying
nominal commonage rents and enjoying
pasturage rights, of which latter they
have Deen deprived. At one blow the
landlords appropriated 24.000 acres â more
than one-naif â to tbeir sole use, and of
the balance the rent has been nearly
trebled."
It was for protesting against these out
rages that Father McFadden has been
thrust into jail and confined there for, in
his two terms, more than a year. Since
his appointment as parish priest in 1876, a
recejit writer declares, "the people have
known no other earthly providence than
the gray-eyed priest, with the strong, bull
dog face, lit up like the lops of the Done
gal Mountains in fair autumn weather by
a smile that is sunshine itself. It was
pathetic to me, a stranger, to go to
Gweedore in the father's absence and
note the lost air of the people. They
were like orphaned children. It showed
me, v non-Catholic. that nothing
short of a rare combination of popu
lar sympathies with tie habit of
ascendency which the Catholic priest ex
ercises in his capacity of spiritual auto
crat could have raised the folk of Gweedoro
from the cruel rieeradat ions of their lot.
They were slaves; Father McFadiien
made them men. He taught the value of
combination; he formed .branches of the
league; he cleared the way to the Land
Courts; he protected their vote in the
Revision Court-. He gavo the people law
where they had none. With the new
spirit of freedom came, as was to be ex
pected, a great moral revolution. * â¢ *
Unroedore is practical iy a parish of tee
totalers. Petty liiigation â "the curse of
the Irish peasantâ has disappeared, and
the courthouse at Gweedore is only open
when a coercion act is in force."

Up by Two Men Last
Night.
Because H? Had No Money They
Beat Him Into Unconscious*

D. F. Bean, a teamster living at Twen

by footpads last night, and beaten into
unconsciousness.
He was on his way home, between 11
and 12 o'clock, walking along Bryant
street. As be reached Seventeenth street,
two ruen suddenly confronted him and
demanded his money. One of tliem had

menacingly at Bean's head.
Bean told him he did not have a cent,
and with an oath the footpad with the
revolver strucK him on the bead witn the
butt end, knocKing him down. He was
stunned uy the blow, out felt them going
Ibrouch his pockets. He had told them
the 1 1 mh, and when they found that his
purse was empty they beat and kicked
him until he entirely lost consciousness.
The footpads, aftÂ»r venting their rape
upon the inoffensive man, disappeared.
Bran was di* C uvered by a citizen, who no
tihed the Seventeenth-street station.
.Bean was unable to give any description

RUSHING WORK ON
THE VALLEY ROAD
Agent Young Spsaks of a
Clear Sweep to Bakers
field.
Two Suits for Condemnation
Brought on the Reed ley and
Visalia Line.
Four Camps of Graders and a Large
Number of Te.m âA Stcx;y of
Renewed Ac.ivity.
C. S. Young, rieht of way agent for the
San Francisco and San Joaquin Railroad,
was among the arrivals here yesterday.
He says the work iÂ» prceressing rapidly
on the road and that apparently all the
wishes of the builders oi the road and ot
friends of tne line will be realized.
"There is a clear right of way now,"
said Mr. Young, "from Fresno to Bakers
field by way of Hanford, a distance of 110
mile;. Tha grading south of Fresno,
which commenced last Sunday, is going
right along. There are some 200 men and
120 teams at work, as near as I recall.
They expect to get to Hanford, which is
about thiny miles distant, by July 1.
"The only big river to cross is Kings,
for which a bridge contract has been given
already. The other streams are small â in
fact, they are largely canals. There are
four or five* of them. In all, there are
four camps of the gradera on the Hanford
line."
Speaking of other work in obtaining the
right of way Air. Young said:
"We are now working on the Reedley
and Visalia part of the San Joaquin road.
We have all the contracts for right of way
between Fresno ai,d Visalia, with the ex
ception of four or five.
"A suit of condemnation has been com
menced against Smilie Brothers, the con
tractors, of this City, for a right of way
through Del Rio R-y vineyard, owned by
them, for the distance of one mile. An
other suit has been brought against W. D.
Kendall, a capitalist of Sacramento, for
right of way through thirty acres. A
case is pending in connection with crossing
a corner of twelve acres owned by R. J.
Truman. It may be settled to-day.
"We expect to go to work on tue Reed
ley line to Visalia quickly, and buiia into
Visalia, 130 miles, by July 1.
"It is livelier in the valley now than it
was a while ago. The completion of tn*e
road to Fresno has helped that town. One
can see that i% is brisker than it was.
People are feeiine pretty good. There is
no question but the cheaper freight rates
cb uined through its completion will be of
great benefit to the people.",
Mr. Young's stay here will be brief. He
expects to get back to Fresno to-day.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
"Shore Acre*" Meet* With Sncceaa at
the Baldwin â Popular Melodrama
at the Grand.
"Shore Acres" at the Baldwin is not
creating any particular furor, though it
ia drawing fairly well. Ererytning in the
play aeems to appeal to t.e audiences
that see it; even the property baby is ap
plauded. The peculiar charm of the play
liea in the delicacy and quiet truth fulness
of its character drawing and its local
coloring. Probably there are character
istics that dawn on the public somewhat
slowly, but as "Shore Acres" will stay
here two weeks longer, San Francisco will
have time to learn to know it well.
"At the French Ball," with Fanny Rice
B\tue bright particular star, is keeping
the audiences at the Columbia Theater in
a state of almost continuous merriment.
Several members of the supporting com
pany have cecome popular, particularly
John S. Terry, as Paic.'i, tne shoemaker;
John Conley, wno is very amusing and
natural as Erasmus, the colored servant,
and Taillard, who is funny without being
vulgar in the role of JSightbird at Die ball?
â¢'At the French Ball" will run for part
of next week.
"Ten Thousand Miles Away" is enjoy
ing a prosperous run at the Grand. The
stage settings are especially good, the
view of San Francisco from the deck of
the Meamer Honolulu being always ap
plauded. Lander Stevens has made a
tuvorable Impression and Baby Temis has
become a prime favorite. Several of the
spec. al ties are very good.
"Saints and Sinners" is drawing well at"
the Alcaznr. George Osbourne is touch
ingly pathetic as the leading saint in the
organization, and Francis Powers and
ifaurioa Stewart cleverly capture the
hatred they deserve as champion sinners.
Miss Juiiet Crosby, one of the Alcazar's
debutantes, .has only a very little role as
Fanny, a country girl, who i<* just engaged
to be married, but her make-up is so re
markably bucoiic, and she acts witn such
tittering coyness, that she makes the hit of
the performanceâ it a hit is to oe gauged
oy laughter and applause. Miss Frances
Jolliffi has a strong part, and for a
debutante does some remarkable work in
it. Gordon Foster is clever as the revenge
lui lover, and John Armstrong does good
work as the ingcniou- Lot Burden.
"By Proxy" will be played next week.
Both operas in the Tivoli's double bill
are well acted and well staged. In "Pa
tience" the choruses are sung with excel
lent spirit and precision, and in hia make
up as the esthetic Bunthorne, Ferris
Hartman's warmest admirers scarcely
knew him, till they recognized some of
his characteristic touches. "Tbo Lovely

on "Caniille," and the swimming icats of

MORE OPIUM FOUND.
A Second Seizure Made by Customs In
spectors on the Panama Steamer
Acapulco Yesterday.
The customs inEpsctors on tho steamer
Acapulco, encouraged by tne finding of
twenty-eight tins of smuggled ooium in
the falÂ«e bottom of Quartermaster Vad
vars' trunk, are exercising more than or
dinary vigilance, and their zeal was re
warded yesterday by the rinding of another
small lot oi the contraband drup.
Concealed in the steering gear in a place
not likely to be overhauled they discovered
four 5-tael tins of optlm, which were
promptly confiscated and sent to the ap
praiser's store. Of course no owner ap
peared to claim the tins and no arrests
were made.
Dennis Vadvars, the quartermaster of
the steamer, who was arrested on a charge
of smuggling, was beld in $1000 bonds by
United States Commissioner Heacock* yes
terday.
HEALTH DEPAETMENT RAID.
Food Seized at an Auction Store and
One Arreat Made.
Market Inspector Ben Davig, Milk In
spector Dockery and Police Officer Butter
worth yesterday made a raid upon Mor
ton't auction store, 106 Pine stree 1 ., and
cairied away 66 cases of canned and bot
tled goods, which were found to be unfit
for food. They learned that the goods
had been consigned to the house for sale
by H. Levy & Co. They consisted of canned
fish, ehrimpa, meats, mustard and some
other commodities. H. Morton, who was
selling the goods, was arrested. Last nicht
it was reported that Levy would be "ar
rested to-day. Some of "the nab. which
was marked 65 cents p*r tin, was sold at
the auction store at the rate of 15 cents
per case and 33 cases were purchased at
that price by John Kunst, who does busi
ness on Harrison street. Louis Fish of
Oakland bought the remainder of the con
signment. The cases, bottles and cans
were all taken to the City Hall last night
to be used aa evidence.

Strange Incidents in the Career cf a

'.A throng of old-time residents of San
. Francisco, among them many of the earli
est of the pioneer-s'attended the obsequies
of ex-Congressman Thomas B. Shannon
at Pioneer Hall yesterday afternoon. The
large room was packed, and out on the
>ides were many who were obliged to see
and hear what they could from a distance.
Over 200 people went away, having been
unable 10 get into the ball.
The ceremonies were conducted by the
JVv. W. W. Case cf the Methodist Ep:sco
f>ai Church, after which the burial service
tithe California Pioneers was lead by one
of the members. The pall-bearers were
Deputy Co. lector E. B. Jerome, Major T.
J-. Blatoney, E. B. Dinsroore, J. Lux, E.
C. Vreeland and J. B. Richmond, lung tlie
confidential cierk of Mr. Shannon. The
remains of the man who naa led such a
bnay life were laid away in the Masonic
Cemetery. It was one 01 the longest
funerals seen here for a long time.
'The ex-Congressman was to have left
for Washington, D. C, yesterday. He
and Air. Richmond had talked it all over
and that was the date set. After they had
di-cussedthe matter, however, Mr. Shan
non found he could not weJl get off till
March 1. He would miss the inaugura
tion, but he wou d visit his old mend Mr
kiniey at the White Home after it was all
over. He wa* a close mend of both Major
and Mrs. McKinlev, and he was of L>. A
McKmiey, the ex- Minister of Hawaii, who
not long since d.ed here.
â  Mucn interesting matter relative to Mr.
S-hannon is told by J. B. Richmond, who
knew him intimately during the years ol
his lif; in California and who was his
Chief cierlt when Mr. Shannon was Re
ceiver of the United States Land Office.
Mr. Richmond says the only thins: left
c>ut of ihe once iarge fortune of Mr. Shan

"Mr. Shannon was a native of Pennsyl
vania and afterward lived in I.linois. 1 '
?aid Mr. Richmond. "Ha started across
rhe plains in 1849 for California during
the gold excitement. Arriving here he
went to Piuraas County und tuere started
a' uhshop. for he was & tinner by traJe.
"Eventually he sold out to his partner,
and taking another partner he engaged in
the general merchandising business. He
also engaged in mining and bought in a
large ditch.
"Abov.t this time he wa* elected a mem
beT of the Assembly from Piumas County,
und aiterward a Senator from Piumas ir.d
Sierra or Lassen. Later h? came to San j
Francisco, and from here he was elected I
to Con_re-Â»s. After hi? term had expired
President Lincoln dppoin:eii him Surveyor
)1 the Port here, ana he served as Collector
or four years. Then President Grant ar
ointed him Collector nt Customs, and in
ihat posinon he served eight years.
â¢â¢That- was the last ofice he held till
President Harrison appointed him Re
:eivpr of the United States Land Office in
j-an Francisco. He tilled that place four
rears, and -rained the respect and friend
ship of Hi i. Even men who came to ask him
avors but could not have them granted,
yore his imnds. He was courteous to '

The Brig Percy Edwards Leaving Port in Tow of the Tug Ida W With Ninety-Nine Colonists
Aboard Who Are Seeking a New Home on an Island in the Southern Seas. They Are
Well Supplied With Dogs and Cats.
COLONISTS MAKE
A GOOD START
The Percy Edward Was
Â» Towed to Sea Yes
terday.
Every One of the Ninety-Nine
Passenarers Was Very
Hopeiul
Their Drstination h One of the Many
Islands (f the El. ice Group,
Near Fj.
The brij Percy Edward got away yes
terday morning, and there were at least
1000 people down to see her off. Not one
of the voyagers apparently had a friend in
the world, 88 there was no handshaking
and no tears when the vessei moved away
from the wharf.
Manager Reinhart was at lirsi in a bad
humor over what the newspapers had
said about the expedition. "We are on a
legitimate enterprise," said he, "and I
don't think we should be ridiculed. We
are going to Funafuti in ihe Eilice group,
and 1 am confident that we will have no
trouble in getting the permission of the
Governor of Fiji to settle there. The
place is one of the most beautiful spots in
the southern seas and can support twice
the number of men we have aboard. It is
only one of the group of islands that are
awaiting colonists, and I intend coloniz
ing them. From Fiji to the Eilice group
is only a day's run for a steamer, and I'll
bet you a new hat that inside of twelve
months we are in direct communication
with Australia and New Zealand. We are
on no wild-goose chase and are after no
'Adamless Kden.' as you boys have been
making out."
Tbe following description of the desti
nation of the adventurers i* taken from
tbe Melbourne Leader ot ia-t January :
The atoll of Funafuti was discovered by Cap
tain Peyster, in tne Rebecca, on the 18th of
March, "1819. According- to observations oi
Captain Wllkes it lies in 8 deg. 30 mln. 45 sec.
soutii, 179 de o '. 13 mln. 3U sec. tut, â  position
which may otherwise be described as due
north of Fiji, and precisely half-way between
that and the equator.
The near-:-Â«! high lau'l is tbe small island oi
KotumaD, 260 miles to the southwest, but tbe
nearest land of any considerable size is Vanua
Levu, 450 miles south.
â  On Hearing Funafuti, as with any South sea
atoll, a long low llneof vegetaiktn on the i:or.
zon gives tne first intimation of the approach
to land. Looming larger the tallest palm trees
nhow their plumed heads sharp against tbe
sky. Nearer, if to windward, the dense vege
tation 1b framed by a long white line of ever
breaking surl ; to leeward a beach of sand, daz
z iiu: white in the sunshine, limits the forest.
Not till the observer has entered the lagoon
by one of the navigable channels does the
at<>ll as a whole extend before him.
Ti-.e outline of Funafuti is that of a pear, the
curved stem of which is directed southward.
Oniheeastor windward side the outline is
sketched in most firmly, the thread of rt-e: and
palm being here almost continuous; but on
the leeward side so many and so wide arc the
gaps that the interspaces of surf far exceed
those dots where the atoll rim emerges a<< dry
iand. The lagoon, a noble sheetof water about
ten miles long and eight broad, thus bounded,
is plentifully besprinkled wlih shoals, many
of which rise to the surface and "break." Its
mriximuia depth is thirty fathoms, the genera,
level oi the floor being *bout twenty, whence
it steeply rises to the beacn.
A more motley crowd surely never
started on such an expedition. The average
age was about 35, but among the ninety
and nine who went as passengers there
were men who were .well up to the tbree
score-and-ten limit and boys who had only
cast their first vote. When it came to a
rollcalt in ihe early watches of the morn
inc there was one man missing. Later on
he showed up and demanded his money
back. It was given him and the vessel
proceeded to sea. All along the front
the vessel was cheered unrt many of
the tugs and steamers saiutr-d her as she
was towea past by the Ida W. The crowd

on bor.rd was unresponsive, however, and
the men were apparently of ihe same
mind as the man who remarked, as the
vessel moved from Main-street wharf,
"I'm â glad to get away from Cali:ornia
and I hope I'll never see San FraucUco
again."
Captain Peterson expects to make the
run to Levuka in about sixty cays. In
that eve U the hrst news from the brig, if
ail goes well, should reach here on "the
steamer that arrives in J une from Sydney,
n. aw.
Fifteen dogs and two cats formed pnrt
of the belongings of the colonists. They
sajf that later on they will get ail the cows
and borsei they want from Australiu, but
their object at the present time is to find
their land and build their homes. They
nave great hopes, but so far as could be
learned yesterday not a man among them
has ever seen the Southern Seas or has
any idea as to the dillicuities to be en
countered. They looK for a new Arcadia.
However many may suffer. Manager
Reinhart certainly wiil not. He is about
?7000 ahead on t ;e venture and as soon as
he lands his men on Funafuti he will at
once return to San Francieco for a second
batch of colonists.

SCHOONER UNA
MAY NOW ENTER
Collector Wise Receives
Instructions From
Washington.
Some New Complications Over
the Bill of Health of the
Vessel.
Cjptain Ha:kns May Find Himsell
L able to a Fine of Five Thou
sand Dollars.
The troubles of Captain Harkins of the
American- schooner Una, who sailed hit
vessel out of the liarbor of Panama sev
eral weeks sgo without clearance papers,
nnd who was refused entry at this port
because of his lack of the proper docu
ments, are practically over, but he still
has one complication to face.
Collector Wise received a letter from
the Treasury Department yesterday in
answer to a telegram explaining the mat*
ter, statins that tne vessel might be al
lowed to enter here as though she had
her paper?. The captain's affidavit rela
tive to the reasons for his leaving Panama
so hurriedly is now on the way lo Wash
ington in company with a detailed com
munication from Collector Wise.
Thus far the vesÂ»el is out of difficulties,
but it appears that the Consul neglected
or refused â it is uncertain which â to issue
a clean bill of health to the Una, and this
matter wi:l be the subject of further cor
respondence between ihe Collector and
the dep*r;ment.
The penalty for leaving a port of a for
eign country and enteiiiit; one within the
jurisdiciion of the United States without
me bill of health is $S(WO, ana unless Cap
tain Harkins can ahovr tuai lie had some
good excuse for leaving without the nre
cious clean til ho may be compelled to
pay the piper.
Captain Hart ins and the owners and
agents of the Una insist that i.c took the
only course left him to escape an unjust
im prison men t in a Columbian dungeon
and possible confiscation of his vessel.
He knew that efforts were being made lo
bnvehim thrown into jail on a trumped
up charge so that the freight on s cargo of
mahogany logs he had brought to Panama
from a South American port micht be
saved to its owners and he asked for his
papers from th* Araericuii Consul.
Tne latter feared to comply with the re
quest and told the skipper so, but advised
him that he was getting into a dangerous
position and had better haul up his anchor
and fly. HarKins asked for his bill of
health, but could not eret it and slipped
out of the harbor before the authorities
were aware of his intention.
Ha was chafed by a Columbian gunboat
that pottered after him for a Uay, but ne
finally got out of danger.
His cargo of logs, minus an owner, can
now be discharged here, but Captain Har
kins will have to remain in port until the
bill of ueaith matter is settled.

A PROSPECT OF
EARLY RELIEF
The Finance and Execu
tive Committees Are
Busy.
The Question of Funds Alone
Prevents Work on the
Boulevard.
Serious Distress Is Still Eeing Alle
viated by tbe Unemployed
Organ izatioa.
A few technical details alone prevent the
immediate commencement of the work on
the projected boulevard to Ingleside. Chief
Engineer Schussler ot the Spring Valley
Water Works yesterday informed the
executive committee that tbe necessary
surveys of tbe company's right of way had
been completed, and that the deeds would
be ready for the City's acceptance this
morning. The grades for ex-Mayor Sutro's
right of way, however, have not yet been
prepared, but wben that is done at least
600 men can be put to work almost im
mediately, provided, of course, the dimen
sions of the relief fuud warrant such
action.
The finance committee appointed by
Chairman W. M. Bunker of the general
relief committee to devise ways and
means for the relief of the unemployed
held a busy session yesterday morning
and prepared a provisional list of district
and special committees for publication.
The members pre-ent were: A. S. Bald
win, chairman; J. C. Johnson, W. M.
Bunker, L. R. Eiler'., Louis Bloss Jr. and
tne secretary, Charles Fay.
Chairman Lefrinpwell of the unem
ployed organization interviewed tbe com
mittee prior to its regular session, but
proposed no alternative plan for its adop
tion. He merely wished to assure the
members of the real necessity at present
existing throughout iho City, and the
nred more especially of affording imme
diate relief to destitute families.
The committee then continued the work
of drafting the list of suecial and district
committees, and finally gave the follow
ing names for publication, with the un
derstanding that the list is provisional
and subject to subsequent modification if
deemed advisable:
1. East Â«nd Drumm streets, from Market to
the bayâ E. H. Baxter, Captain Minor Goodall,
Henry Kron.
2. From tiie west side of Drumm to the east
side of Front streetâ Frank bu inner, Albert
Castle. A. M. Ebbets.
3. From the east side of Front street to the
east side of Sansonie streetâ J. C. Johnson,
Levl Straus*, Adam Grant, George K. Porter,
Isaac Upham.
4. Sautonie street.from Market street north â
Lippman Sachs, Henry J. Crocker, W. M.
Bunker.
5. Montgomery streetâ Cornelius O'Connor,
L R. Ellert, I. J. Truman.
6. Kearny street and Grant avenueâ F.
Ma*key. A. Fusenot, M. A. Gunst, Edward Hol

7. North side of Market meet from Grant
avenue to Jonesâ Robert McElroy, R. E. Mil.er,
J. J. Groom, James P. Dunn.
8. Mariut street, east side of Main to the
bayâ John McCoid, balance unnamed.
9. From Main to t-'irst street, running south
âA. A. Waikius, John Merriil, Sauford Ben
nett.
10. From First street to Xew Montgomery
southâ C. Smith, R. H. Pense, J. P. Le Count.
SPECIAL COMMITTEES.
Banksâ Thomas Brown, S. G. Murphy, I. W.
Hellman Jr.

Staples.
Produce Exchangeâ C. S. LaumeiÃter, A. Ger
berdlng, Thomus W'alkington.
Bar Ass'<ciation â W. s. (ioodfellow, Harold
Wheeler, R. H. Lloyd, W. H. Chkkemig.

Theatersâ A. Bouvier, S. H. Friedlander,
Walter Morosco.
Bicyclesâ H. P. Winn, J. M. Corwell, George
A. Adams.
It will be seen from the foregoing that
the City has been so districted a3 to facili
tate the subscription canva-s of the differ
ent committees and that the gentlemen
appointed Â«o act in each district are thor
oughly representative and energetic in
character. Cans bpreckels was named to
act as chairman of a committee at large,
but. as previously stated, these nomina
tions arÂ° not final.
Every member of the district and spe
cial committees is authorized to collect
money subscriptions, which will ail be
turned over to Daniel MÂ« yer, the Pine
street banker, the treasarerof the unem
ployed fund.
The members of these committees are to
be individually notified of their appoint
ment at once, and it is expected that the
work of canvassing for subscriptions will
start to-day. Mr. Bunker expressed him
self yesterday as confident that as soon as
the people recognized that the relief com
mittee was in earnest they would liberally
respond to the appeal for assistance. Tne
money collected will be received by the
treasurer and paid out as occasion df
mands, and subscriptions on paper,
thonsrh they will never be rejected, will
not be viewed with the same favor as spe
cie and cheek payments.
The executive committee, in the persons
of Messrs. L. R. Ellen, 11. J. Crocker. C.
\V. McAfee. Lippraan Sachs, Hugh Craig,
William M. BunKer and Cornelius O'Con
nor, met again yesterday afternoon in the

rooms of the Chamber of Commerce, when
the boulevard scheme was at onca brought
up for discussion.
Mr. Crocker suggested ihe practicability
of extending the boulevard to the county
limits and expressed his belief that tha
peopie all along the line, whose property
would be improved by ihe work, would
readily contribute hundreds of dollars to
promote it.
Mr. O'Connor said thr.t this matter
could be taken up later. If the City
would guarantee the present right of way,
then work might be beÂ«un at once, and
the City's acceptance was certain as soon
as the other two deeds were obtained.
Mr. Bunker said that sufficient grades to
make a street had already been fixed and
that the nocessary stakes could be set in
twenty-four hours.
Mr. Crocker moved that a committee be
appointed to make preliminary arrange
ments with respect to the deeds, tbe ap
pointment of a superintendent, etc., and
report 10 the executor. The motion car
ried, Messrs. Crocker, O'Connor and
Schussler being appointed members of
tbe committee.
During a discussion as to the possibility
of starting operations Mr. Burke said he
thought there should be at least $5000 in
the treasury before this was done.
P. Broderick, an employe of the railway
company, being invit- d to Rive the com
mittee ihe benefit of his practical experi
ence in work of this kind, advised the
hiring of men by the hour. Eight hours
a day, he considered, should be sufficient.
There should also oe some classification
of wages, if it could be satisfactorily ar
ranged. He himself was pretty well ac
quainted with the worthy residents of the
City who would be willing to work on the
boulevard, lie would be in favor of
allowing such men 20 cents an hour.
The committee, however, reiused to en
tertain such a proposal. "This is v matter
of charily and temporary relief," said Mr.
Eilert, "Â«nd me do not intend to pay the
uniform wages."
Mr. Bunker then advised the committee
to issue an appeal tj the public, to be
signed by every member of the different
committees and circulated throunh the
press. A permanent assistant should be
engaged to remain on the premises all the
time and give the necessary information
to the newspapers respecting subscrip
tions.
The committee adopted this suggestion
and Mr. Eilert undertook lo have the ap
peal ready for publication that evening.
Mr. Bunker, returning to t c boulevard
project, said it inisht be possible to ar
range for t lie free transportation of the
men to and from their \jork. Formerly
they had been obliged to pay car lares and
these, had considerably reduced their
wages.
Chief Engineer Schussler of the Spring
Valley Water Works arrived at this mo
ment ana informed the committee of the
completion of the surveys, and added that
the deeds would be ready this morning
and would be at once presented for tho
City's acceptance. The board of direct
ors, he said, had unanimously granted the
right of way. â 
The only difficulty now remaining was
with respect to the grade on Sutro'B rignt of
way, which had not yet been fixed. The
company's right of way, now ready, could
afford employment for 100 men only.while
Mr. Sutro'3, when the grades had i.'een de
cided, could afford employment for at
least 500.
A communication was received from the
managers 01 the Busli-street Theater ten
dering a benefit jvrfornianc- for the un
employed of "The New Si Perkins," which
will be presented next week by Sam J.
Burton ana the charming comedienne,
Lillie Colbinan. This was acknowledged
with thank-.
The committee adjourned to meet again
at 3 o'clock tliis and every other afternoon
until otherwise ordered.
The family relief committee of the un
employed orcanization has now no less
than sixty-one urgent cases on its books.
Vl'he commissariat wagon was out again
yesterday drawn by human hands, and,
among other contributions, received
twenty sacks of coke, which will prove
very acceptable when the weather is cold.
This department of the organisation's
activity is now wonderfully woll systema-
Vz d. Before the wagon is sent round
during the day members of the soliciting
committee visit various likely plac s and
record ttie promise-* received ot donations
in kind. They afterward present their
report to the secre ary, who in turn
lurnishes the teamsters with a list cf
name", and in this way the work of col
lection is simplified und expedited.
The stock of provisions on hand yester
day was said to be sufficient for another
day, though unexpected appeals for out- j
sidi* assistance might deplete it consider- |
ably in i.ne meantime. The commissariat j
department also includes a email store of
cast-off clothing anil old shoes, which is
replenished ana exhausted nearly every
day. Incidentally it may be stated that
the boots have given riso to some little
friction, which has resulted in the sum
mary expulsion of about twenty-five men.
These comprised the very laziest mem
bers of itie organization, who refused to
do a "tap" of work and yet expected to
receive all the benefits ar*cru.n<_' to mem
bers in good t.tandins. When their appli
cation lor footwear w-as refused, on the
ground tbat necessity must first be
served, they proceeded to conspire against I
the body politic, and were therefore eject
ed, "to prey at fortune."
President LemngweH states that nego
tiations are at present pending which
may eventually lean to the employment
of 300 men on a mining proposition at
good wages. At the moment, i.owever,
he was not prepared to give further par
ticulars. "I think I can put it through,"
he said, "and if successful, it will greatly
relieve the situation here in the City. I
saw Air. Ellert this morning and he inti
mated that the executive committee was
considering a dollar a Uay proposition. I
opposed it on the ground that such wages,
though they might keep body and soul to
gether, were no guarantee for the future."
Four hundred and fifty men are daily
fed on the premises, ami the ingenuity of
Louis Hartel. the German chef, is con
tinually taxed in order to satisfy so many
hungry mouths. Often enough they have
to be satisfied with one meal a day, though
two are always provided when the stock
on hand permits.
Mayor Pheian, who was the first to re
spond to the appeal for assistance, yester
day contriDuted another $250 to the gen
eral relief committee's iunu, of which
Daniel Meyer, 21G Pine street, is the treas
urer.

THE OUTLOOK BRIGHTENING.
All Branches of TradÂ© Improving in
the Ernst.
The circular of Henry Clewi, under date of Sew
York, February 20. draws tbe following roiy pic
ture of trace conditions then-:
Domestic conditions retain the symptoms of re
covery which I lately noted as having Â»et in, and
theie can now be no que-tion that the general
business of the country is at least steadily drifting
into a healthy activity. The tonnage return* of
the railroads, eastward and wes ward, show a very
satisfactory increase, and the same tendency ap
pears in current reports of railroad earnings
which contrast favorably with tbosoo! January.
Wiih trifling exceptions rates of freight are stable,
which, totether with the exiremely low prices of
railroad supplies, should lw favorable to the Let
earnings.
The merchandise markets show a very marked
Improvement. The < ommercial hotels are full of
bu.tenfiom all sections of the country and it is
doubtful i* the inierior trade was ever b -fore so
folly represented in this city. Within the last nine
cnys no le-s than IHUO dry -jcoods buyers airivÂ«d
her., i In- wooieri -goods tra-Je shows a distinct
ri covery and nmls that have oeen closed for
ir.or.ths are resuming work. A similar recovery Is
apparent in nearly all other kinds of merchandis?.
Th" interior .buyers are discriminating and care
ful, but the aggregate of their purchases i-Â» making
:i satisfactory Impretalon upon stocks of goods.
There are nownere any Indication!* of a specu atlve
i-.cmand for merchandise, but a fair, conservative
buslnen is realized in the trades generally and
prices are steady.
Tlie b.-eakinK'np of the Steel Rails Association
â¢ has re^n tiii in sales variously estimated Â«t from
1 0,(1 000 to 1.100,000 tons, the price having set
wa to $18 to 920. according to location of
niuriiet. The â¢ elease of the rail market will set in
o; eration n larre amount of business w hch has
for mm â â¢â¢ moothi. Iromthewin
ur uh'.a: sections the accounts nre s: i 11 favorable,
the tliiCK snow banket having preseived the
plant iv good condition mil the prospects being
almost uniformly hopeful for the crop.
The foie.gn trade movement still runs largely in
our favor. The gain in exports is naturally heijin
nine .0 tiha'p. and th â¢ li?ureÂ» for January show pd
increase over la.si via.- of $7,1 00.000. while for
the previous quar>i>r ;he gain had i.ve raged over
?_ ... OUO.OUO per niooih. Rut the imports tor Jan
uary :-!:ow a rmich larser rste of decrease than
previously, the laii nc â¢ B t>pu,p *1ti.9u0,000, while
lor 1 lie m n hs of December, November Â«nil Octo
ber the iieiTf-:iiÂ»- averaged only $1 a. 500.000. The
)ner< himdisi- iini o ts for last month amounted to
953.200.0ii0, while the exports were Vxhu-d at
"000. wlm h (hows a balance in our favor,
on the inerchandi->e account, uniountlntr to $45.
--800.000. For the same month in 1896. the credi
tor Laliince was 5L'2. 500,000.
These figures show thai we cun safely postpone
expectations Ol cod exports; lor in addition to
this oa a' co of 45.8 millions for January we must
reckon the larco sum of export bills still held
here, but wblch will now soon matur>. These
balaiict's will much more than cover the interest
1 ayah:.- abroad at the beginning of March. We
aie evident y now entering on a period In which
the late large creditor balance between imports
and exports will b- modified, and we may expect
tv sci- increases in the imports and decreases In
the exports; but. in the meantime, it would seem
that Europe mus be owing la gely to the United
Mates on the balance of past tr. mi sections, includ
ing financial as well as commercial.

CHICAGO MAKKKTS.
CHICAGO, 111.. Feb 25 âThe news on wheat
this morning was greatly to the advantage of the
bears, but prices did not break as badly a* It was
anticipated they would. The Cincinnati Price
Current reported the growing wheat in good con
dition and claimed that the unmarKeted supplies
were larger than has been believed. The quota
tions on English consols were higher and those on
wheat at Liverpool were :d lower In addition to
these bearish factors, a dispatch from New York
giving a sensational condition of the relations be
tween Spain and the Uuitea .States produced a
feeling of apprehension.
Notwithstanding the array of discouraging;
Items, however, wheat oi>ened but 3g c to Vi e
lower than yesterday's close, and afler u-clinnn: a
fraction rallied. "-^hons' 1 were goo 4 buyers and
several scalpers were endeavoring 10 turn tbi sen
timent in a bullish direction. Kecelpts at Chicago
were thirteen cars, and 144,992 bushels were with
drawn from sture. The .-orthwest, had 198 cars,
against 182 last Thursday ana 465 a year ago.
Closing continental cables were all I oÂ«vr. Ex
port clearances were light at 206,700 bu shell.
Later In the session St. Louis sent numerous crop
damage reports ana also bought wbea . I'rlce.H
then became stronger and advanced sharply.
Ihe close was at aboiu the best ll; urea of the
day. May wheat opened from 73%3 to 73y*c,
sold between 73% and 748/g. closing at 73%@
7 /BC, s;c higher man yes. errtay. Kstlmated re
ceipts lor to-morrow 12 car*. No. 2 spot red
wheat r.inced from B'JS/sC to 84V.C, cosine at
about 84 V*@S4B/ic.
' <.OKNâ 'lhere was good buying of May corn by
a large concern, and of September by a prominent
commission-house, these purchases holding th"
market in a very firm position during the mom-
Ing. i The opening was rather easy In coniplune.it
to tbe weakness of wheat at the start, but the frac
tional depreciation winch then took place was not
enduring. Liverpool cab wfre lyfcd lower. Re
ceipts were light at ISI cars, and 1: 6.166 bushels
were withdrawn from sort-. The Cincinnati Price
Current reported thai the unmarketable supply of
corn is not under 1,3.MJ.0U0,Ub0 busba.s. The
bulge in wlica* near the en of the session served
10 harden corn. Exports were liberal at 533,1
buahcis. May corn opene 1 at 241 ' s c, advanced to
W-lSg'-, closi:i- at 24i/4fSÂ«iJ43/ B e, a ontde over yes- j
it-iuay. Estimated receipts 101 to-morrow, 175 ;
cars.
OATSâ The oat market was In an absolutely
stagnant state. A few scalping operations were
an that look place. No outride orders were re
ceived. Keceipti were 179 cars. There were no
withdrawals from store. The condition of the
market depended altogether on the strength or
weakneis in tie surroundings. Export â¢ clear
ances were insignificant. May. oats cosed y 8 c
lower. Estimated receipts for to-morrow V.US

.The Annexation League Issued a state
ment this atternoon for the ourpose of
sli-owi nt; what effect Greater Oakland will
have on the annexed territory. It says:
As the question of annexation of all the
northern suburbs of Oakland is now before the
pcop.e we are anxious that you should g.ve
the matter your earnest attention and c^re
fuil-y weigh the following fact>:
If annexed lo the city of Oakland you do not
haVe to pay a road tax. Ins'ead of paying a
state and county tax o: $1 3Â© you will pay a
Mate and county tax of but 97 cents. The ex
tra 33 cent-* you now pay mostly goes into the
, Reneral :und. The largest portion of this gen
erai tnud is used on the roads at the o her end
oi the county.
Tlie average rate of taxes in Oakland for the
r.-i-t sixteen yea:s fans been $1 on the $100.
As thedistrict proposed to be a nexed w:li not
Le responsible orcailed on to pay any portion of
the present bonus, interest or indebtedness of
Oak ai.d tne rate iv the annexed district will
. .be bat 82 eenis i>d the if 100. this added to the
S'.aie and county tax ins de of corporations
â¢will make a total tax oi $1 79 on the $100 tor
city .county. Staie Rnd ro..Â»i tax. Only 49 cents
on tiie $100 more thai; your i resent tuxes.
The ad vantages that will ioiiow annexation
are:
The free use of Oakland's general system of
Bewers. Wmle the Piedmont Sanitary District
. paid out $7000 lor the use oi one outlet, ana
I. l\- n sanitary tax to-day of 80 centa on the
$100.
Ine free use of the schools of Oakland;!
$4200 j.a:a iast year by residents of the Dro

ALAMEDA. Cal., Feb. 25.â The politi
cal situation here is curious. The unex
reeled strength shown by Lam bom's
friends at Harmonic Hall, where tney ex
pectea to see Ballentine have his own way,
has put Lamborn stock away up. Roswell
G. Wheeler did not make an active canvas
for tne nomination at either convention,
as he was sick with the grip, and yet he
was the overwhelming choice of both con

. The incumbents in the City Clerk's,
Treasurer's, Recorder's and Marshal's
(i!kes will virtually have no opt osiuon.
Each has made a good record, and the
citizens, outside of some politicians, are
sa'istied to leave eood enough alone.
City Attorney Taylor will liave a good
chance to wor* lor his position, as R. B.

The tight has centered on the Board of
Trustees and if the bill now before the

ponement of the proposed ceiebration at
the State University in honor of the State

Many Candidates Preserve Silence

Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call, )
908 Broadway, Feb. 25. )
Every night for the past two weeks
various organizations â some of them per
manent, bat most of them temporary â
have been making "indorsements" of can
didates. To such an extent has this in
dorsing process been carried that the man
who can place a value in votes of the
various indorsements is indeed brilliant.
In many wards small clubs have been
organized for '"good government only"
and have made indorsement;, though
what strength they give their favorite
candidates is problematical. In fact, the
matter of indorsing has become * perfect
farce in this campaign.
Indorsements have been made by thÂ«
Good Roads Association, the Municipal
Labor League. Municipal Leaeue, Tax
payers' Convention, American Protective
Association, the Union Lea tie Club, the
League of Labor and various so-called
"cood-government" clubs. As these in
dorsements are about equally scattered, it
is easily seen that the value of one, if it
have any value, is naturally nullified by
the action of another. Never were there
so manr piece clubs and one-man organ
izations a* at present.
The outcome of the movement inau
gurated at the meeting of citizens yester
day at tlie F.rst Presbyterian Church is
being watched with great interest. A
committee of fourteen ate at work and it
is expected that to-morrow tie? will an

advocacy, and an attempt will be made tc
secure the co-operation of the Catholic
clergy in the campaign against the sa
loons.
Another noticeable feature is the per
sistency with which the Populists nre
pursuing their hopeless cause. It was
I practically demonstrated last November
that in this county, and especially i:i Oak
land, Populism was on the decline, and it
certainly has not made any great ad
vances since then. The candidates, how
ever, are very tanguine, and among the
most confident is A- A. Bretz, who -at
tained Fome no: oriety in the last Assem
bly. Mr. Bretz is making as active a can
vass as though he were as sure of election
as Auditor Snow or Treasurer Gilpin. If

Mr. Bretz would bit in the next Council;
but Oakland politics co by tits and starts,
and Mr. Bretz' chances are about equal to

at things in their way. .

average candidate's speech, all efforts to
arouse enthusiasm must have been ex
rended prior to last November. If there

his hearers that if only a majority will

Mr. "Billy" Waikinson smiles at his

not do so. Mr. Seth Mann talked an hour
at the Tabernacle the other night, but

A. C. Henry has a little meeting every

Captain W. R. Thomas has been held by

has not been able to leave his bouse yet,
although it is hoped that he will appear in

Mr. Goodenoueh is a li. tie perplexed. It
was rumored last nicht that the anti
saloon party were going to indorse him
for Mayor. Mr. Goodenougb thinks that
it is necessary to have more votes tuan
those of any one particular element to in
sure success, and as he want-< to be suc

friendship of every party than the osten
tatious good will of any particular eleniaut.

908 Broadway, Feb. 25. J
The Y. M. C. A. entered upoa its nine
teenth year of life to-day.
At the annual meeting Dr. Munhall, the
evangelist, made the address. Some of bis
opening sentences are still interesting hln
hearers and his remarks about the position
of the churches in relation to one another
and to the Y. M. C. A. were somewhat
original.
"We get an idea," said he, "that oar
church is the church. Your church
is the church of man, not the church
of Christ. All these organizations, the
Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Congre
gational, Episcpal and Lutheran cnurch
came into existence by tbe operation of
a law â by the demand of the time". In tbe
urgency of tne hour new organizations
grew out of the old. Not one of them was
the church, else all the others were noth
ing. Each church is accomplishing a work
wnich all the others cannot do, and that
is a sufficient reason for their existence.
"It is much more economical a thou
sand times over to convert a young man
than to tiang him. One of every six of
your population is a young man between
the ages of 14 and 32. With 'he best judg
ment pcs-ible we are forced to conclude
that not more thnn 23 per cent of that
number, which in Oakland would amount
to 10.000, ever darkens the doorway of a
church. Not 10 per cent of this class
habitually attend the services and not
more than 5 per cent are Chris
tians. This clads is more vicious than
any other in Bociety, for statistics reveal
that 75 p*r cent of the criminal popula

I have mentioned.
"In my opinion, he who saves the
young man does the greatest thins on
earth, and the best way to do it is to help

peal to the audience to contribute for the
purpose of defraying the current expenses

CHARGES OF BRIBERY
Rumors That Attempts Were
Made to Fix the City
Committee.
Tbe Oak'and Grand Jury Investigat
ing a Most Sensational
Story.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Feb. 25. )
A sensation has been sprung in local
politics by tbe inquiry of the Grand Jury
to-day into the charges of bribery that
were made so freely while tbe committee
of twenty-one was preparing for the Re
publican city convention.
The charges were somewhat indefinite
and were pun.ishrd in tbe Enquirer. The
particular portion of the article that
caused the present investigation is as fol
lows:
When the scheme o( turning the power of
the city committee to got up a municpai con
vention over to twenty-one citizens was
launched so suddenly there was surprise that
any politicians should be so ready to relin
quish their power, aud an ugly whisper want
around tuat Frank Moffitt had been tampering
with the city committee. But this was denied,
and tbe seemingly knockdown argument ad
vanced: "Look at tbe character of the twenty
one selected. Does any bod; think a single one
of these men would do an thing out of the
way or be under doubtful influences?"
The character of the members of the com
mittee of twenty-one stopped the rumÂ»ts and
suspicions, and, had nothing more developed,
all would navt- been well. No one questioned
tbe motives of tbe twenty-one and no one does
so to-day. If they drop the movement, as it is
now practically certain they will, It will be
double proof that they went in and came out
cle n handed and clean minded.
A few days ago three members of the Dem
ocratic City Committee reported mat Mofflu
had made o fliers of money in differen t amounts
to hire them to dehgate the power of the com
mittee to a committee of citisens who snould
appoint delegates to a convention. In other
words, Moffitt was trying to hire the Dem
ocratic committee to do just what the Repub
lican committee did. This discovery started
suspicion hot-foot after .he facts with regard

here what was discovered, bat enough
was found out to show that the . be
ginning of the business v. us as bad
as bad could be and that Frank Moffitt acted
as midwife to (leaver the Republican City
Committee of the movement to appoint dele
gates through a committee of twenty-one.
There could "be no doubt about the crooked
âthe rank corruptionâ of trie scheme on
the part of at least some of the members of tne
City Committee.
To-day R. C. Wagner, Republican com
mitteeman from the First Ward was before
the Grand Jury and asked for time in
which to prepare any statement he wished
to make. His wish was granted and he
will be neard in a lew days. Wajrner is
said to be the man to whom $250 was of
fered if be would run for Councilman
from bis ward.
Frank A. Leach, the proprietor and ed
itor of the E quire r, vras also before the
Grand Jury and was asked to tell the
source of his information. He declined to
do so, saying that as he was a newspaper
man he considered all such information
as confidential and not to be given to the
public.
Con Brosnahan, chairman of the Demo
cratic City Central Committee, was also
before the Grand Jury, as be is supposed
to be one of the three mentioned in the
article. Frank Â£. Parcells, Republican
candidate for Councilman lrom the F fth
Ward, Rod Church and Frank H. Robin
son, editor of Echoed, were also examined.
K.l i or Robinson published an item last
week that Wagner hod told him of being
approached. .Mr. ,Mollit denied the story
at tbe time, but be has not yet been called
before the Grand Jury.
Mr. Moffitt sa:d to-night that the so
calle I charges had been investigated by
the committee of the committee of twenty
one, who ignored them and went ahead
under the leadership of Dr. George Par
dee and appointed d- legates to the con
vention. ______________

INSTRUCTIVE LECTURES.
Pro'essor Hilgard Discourses
Upon And and Alkali
Soils.
Dr. Koebij Show. That California Can
Beat the Wcrld in the Beet
Sugar Industry.
Edward F. Ad^ms presided over tbe last
of the second session of the Fanners'
Institute belli last evening in the Acade
my of Sciences Hall. He sp ke of the
City Farmers' Institute as a sort oi experi
ment which so far seems to be a success,
anÂ«l added that out of these gatherings
th^re are good piospec;s of a San Francis
co farmers' club being formed. All that
is required is a little money for current
expenses.
Those who live in the City and own or
are interested in farms in various part 3of
the State will be greatly benefited by what
can be learned in the line of experiments
carried on either with or independent of
the experiments mnde under the direc
tion of the State University professors.
He hoped that the club would soon or
ganize and be a success.
The last of the institute lectures was
(riven by Professor E. W. Hilgard and Dr.
Julius Koebig. Professor Hilgard's sub
ject was "ArU and Humid Lands and the
Alkali Problem."
The oroiessor cave an interesting dis
course upon the results of the experiments
made at the State's experimental stations
near Chino and in Tulare County. The
most stubborn of the chemicals in these
so;ls can be bandied it the farmers only
knew how to go to work.
Dr. Julius Koebip's subject was "Cali
fornia as a Competitor In the Sugar Mar
ket." He said that this subject is attract
in;; much attention from all classes. It is
well known that this State can produce
excellent suear beets, but the people have
not taken to this industry as they should,
and the reason is the fear of competition
from European beet-sugar producers and
tbe sugar produced in the tropics from
tbe sugar cane.

COMING TO CALirOENIA.
Probability of a Three Days' Carnival
Before the Great Battle.
"I find that most ot the people who are
coming from the East to attend the fight
at Carson," said General Passenger Agent
Goouman yesterday, "are going to come
on througn to California before they re
turn. This is th- purport of all my ad
vices. In that case California will have
the advantace of getting the larger part
01 the crowd here.
"It is also stated that Manager Stuart
intends to have a three dayÂ»' carnival, be
ginning before the fight. I uo not get
t is from Stuart himself, but from one of
the men representing him. He said it
would begin Monday and run through
Tuesday and Wednesday. It is important
that tiie details in reference to the carnival
be known as early as possible in the East,
so that people intending to come may
know in advance how to govern their
movement*."
It is expected the carnival will have
many features, aside from the great tight,
which will make it full of attractions to
many people.

A COONEY TANGLE
STRAIGHTENED OUT
Judge Cook Explains His
Charge to the Grand
Jury.
No Reference to the Printing
of the Barry Blanks
â¢ â¢ Intended.
Attorneys for trie Fair Es'ate Ask
for a Postponement of the
Pencil Deeds Fight
)
. Explanations were an impromptu order
in the Cooney case yesterday morning.
" There had been a garbled version in
' some of the newspapers â  of Judge Cook's
recent charge to the grand jurors when
he submitted the testimony introduced
against the young notary to that body
three days ago- One sensational daily had
reported that the court had instructed the
â jury to investigate the circumstances at
tending the printing of fac-similes of the
Crocker notarial blanks by -James H.
Barry, which were ordered by Mrs.
Craven'? attorneys with a view to testing
the skill of the experts employed by young
Fair.
* " â¢ Attorney D. M. Delmas asked Judge
Cook if there was anything in this manner
-â  of interpreting his instructions to the jury.
The Jud^e made an emphatic denial.
. Such an idea was farthest from his
thoughts he declared, and he admitted the
right of the lawyers to print the blanks
tor. the purpose for which they were
ordered.
â  â¢ Attorney Del mas got the floor the
nioment me court opened. He said:
During an examination had in this court,
before your Honor, sitting as a committing
; magistrate In ihe case of J. J. Cooney, certain
' certificates were introduced in evidence,
hie 11 had been primed at the request and
suggestion of some of the counsel in a collat-
e ral and Kindred case. In the instructions
which this court gave the Grand Jury a couple
'of days ago, home allusion was made to the
certificates attached to the 80-called Craven
' â¢atid.Fiur deeds.
. A portion "i that charge has been construed
by some people to be intended as a reflection
upon the conduct of counsel in having had the
â¢ first-named certificates printed for the purpose
lof subjecting the expert's science to the test. I
myss<3li could not conceive that any such con
; struction could be placed upon the charge oi
â¢' your Honor, but 1 desire to be officially in
. formed by the court, if the court sees proper to
do so, whether I cm to understand or the
Grand Jury r.re to understand that such was
. the purport oi the charge, so that in the event
that it Miould be deemed necessary, the matter
â¢ could be met with proper explanation from
counsel, .which 1 apprehend ii would not be
.difficult 'to give?
In reply Judge Cook said:
Such an idea as that suggested by you, Mr.
, Delmas, was farthest from my mind, and I
-don't see how my language could be so con
strued in the statement which I made to the
.'Grand Jury when they were called here, and,
in fact,' I cannot conceive how a construction
<>i that son could be placed upon the remarks
I -made. I know that 1 had no such thought
in my mind when addressing the jurors and
intended to convey no such meaning, it is
true that during the course oi the Cooney ex
amination allusions were made in the argu
â¢ment of some of the counsel in the case to
section 134 oi the Penal Code, and it is also
'true I called the attention of the Grand Jury
to sections 470 and 134 of the Penal Code;
but "my object in directing their attention to
those two sections was that they should ex
amine thoÂ«e sections in connection with the
: two certificates attached to the two pencil
deeds.
.Therefore, if a certificate of that sort were
falsely made it might be the committing of a
crime under the provisions of that section,
and it was with that view, and that view
alone, that I directed the attention of the
'Grand Jury to that section; whether they
might consider the making of these ceruii
'cates (if attached to the deeds) brought those
â¢ pe.csous that made them under the provisions
of that section, or the making of the same cer
â¢Xiricates might bring the parties under the
provisions of section 470, for the crime of
,' forgery.
.It was only, as I said before, in relation to
â  those particular certificates attached to the
pencil deeds' that I intended to make any ref
erence, and I did not refer to them in terms; 1
: -simply reierred the matter to the Grand Jury
and thought that was all they would under
stand. Certainly, as far as the action of coun
sel i is concerned, in the making of similar Cir
" tificates, evidence of which was introduced at
the examination cf J. J. Cooney, and from the
very tact that in the opinion which I wrote
â¢ and filed on the motion to discharge the de
fendant in that case I made no allusion to
those certificates or the printing of them by
'. Mr, Barry, or procuring them to be printed by
- counsel, would seem to me- sufficient to indi
cate that I certainly did not consider the
printing of those blanks as a circumstance
â¢tending in any way to establish the guilt of
â¢the attendant, or a circumstance which
I should be considered as tall out or the regu
"â¢ lar ana ordinary course.
Undoubtedly, had 1 considered it a circum
stance of that sort, having searched the entire
record lor evidence and circumstances and
enumerating each fact. I would have undoubt
, edly enumerated that, and, as 1 said before,
the fact that 1 did not consider it at all would
â¢â¢indicate certainly to the counsel that I saw
â¢ nothing in it that was Improper. In fact, it is
a very common every-day occurrence in cases
where experts are examined to prepare for
them simulated or manufactured specimens of
. writing or manufactured specimens of any
â  thing else upon which they are required to
pass. -to that the weight oi their opinion as ex
perts may be tested. It is a matter that has
' Deen d,one repeatedly in cases where identity
is eoncen.ed that a person would be made to
appear like a defendant and brought into
. court to test the accuracy ot one claiming to
identify him. It has been done in the most
I celebrated cases ever tried, and in cases where
". the identity of property is in question. I sup
' pose case after case could De found where ex
. perts upon diamonds have been called upon to
Â° pass an opinion, paste diamonds having been
"made in imitation of the genuine, and putting
; them with the genuine to test them as to their
knowledge.
."And in handwriting it is done every day.
1; was done right here in this court last week
jvhere different samples of handwriting were
' put upon 'paper, and some genuine and some
=o imi I.llloll*. ior the purpose of testing an ex
pert. In the Dams will case 1 remember it
was done, and a. so in the Sharon case; In fact
it is* always done, and if it is permissible in
onch matters, it certainly would be permissi
ble where experts were expected to testify
upon â¢printing or upon any other matter; and
â¢an I say, from the evidence that was offered
herb in the Cooney case, I don't see that there
wns anything done at all by counsel in rela
. tion to the printing of those certificates by
"Mr. Barry wnich could in any sense or any
way be construed to be a criminal act or
â¢ which tould by any possibility bring either
counsel or the printer wltnin the provisions
of section 134 or within the provisions of any
other section of the penal laws of this State. "
From the evidence that wag given on that
examination it distinctly shows that all that
was done was admitted to have been done by
. counsel for a particular purpose. If you will
' remember when each of the counsel testified
â¢in relation to the matter each one of them dis
.tinctly stated under oath that they were not
printed with any intent to deceive the court.
That was stated, I believe, by every witness
who gave any testimony upon the subject at
ati. Whether such statement" were made by
counsel under oath or not, whenever counsel
appear in this court and the court knows him
.to be a gentleman of the bar, and makes
' though not under oath a statement that things
were done for a certain purpose, stating upon
their word as an officer oi Uiis court that they
Were nni done for a deceiving purpose, that
Will. .suffice and will answer all claims as far
as-this court is concerned.
' It certainly satisfied me that they were not
made for any purpose of deceiving the court,
and it certainly was not my intention to lead
the Grand Jury to believe that they were to
investigate any such charge as that. 1 don't
believe they gave any such construction as
that to. my language, and if they did I will
with the greatest of pleasure disabuse their
minds of any such construction and even if
they should present an indictment upon facts
of that sort it would be a piece of waste paper.
I don't believe, Mr. Delmas, that it will be
necessary for you or any one else to ask for a
hearing before the Grand Jury on that matter
at all unless you are advised by them that they
so construed my language. If they did I will j
explain the matter to them.
Attorney Delnias declared be was per- j
fectly satisfied.
The illness of W. M. Pierson, who is the
leading attorney for the executors, has re
sulted in a relapse, and his partner, R. B.
Mitchell, yesterday served notice on the
Craven attorneys that he would apply in

the pencil deeds until March 15. The mat

Advertising.
The Baldwin Clothing Company, a
mammoth establishment located at 924,
926, 928, 930 Market street, which opened
up less than a week ago, has established
for itself in this short time a reputation
which might well be envied by many of
the more pretentious clothing-houses that
have been in business in this City for
years.
8. Meyer and M. Hyman, the members
of this up-to-date institution, are gentle
men who have been engaged in the cloth
ing business for the past twenty- five
years.
The Baldwin Clothing Company enters
upon its busiufss career in this City with
a gigantic sale below cost of the bankrupt
stock of the defunct Rochester Manufac
turing Company, consisting of a complete
line of hign-grade clothes, hats and fur
nishing goods.
This sale, which will continue for sixty
days loncer, was inaugurated for the pur
pose of advertising and firmly establish
ing in the business world of San Fran
cisco this valuable addition to the tailor- j
ing trade of this City.
In variety of patterns, styles, textures, |
and in point of price and linish, the equal :
of the stock of this gigantic store would |
be diificult to rind elsewhere. Ever since i
the opening day, which announcement
was made to the public by well-written j
advertisements of pages and half-pages in
the daily papers, this house has been
growinc in public favor.
The advertisements of the Baldwin
Clothing Company can be depended upon ; j
they are truthfully written, and would,
no doubt, :>rove profitable to any one to
read and study.
"In regard to advertising," said Mr. !
Meyer, the senior member of the linn, "I :
follow as near as possible Hamlet's ad
vice to the players: "Suit the action to the ;
word, and the wora to the action.'
"Does advertising pay ? Of course ad
vertisine pays. Like everything else, it
brings the measure of return that it de
serves. I will show you a store that is
bound to succeed if you will show me a
neat, convincing, truthful advertisement,
bacsed up by good merchandise and hon

'â¢The motto of our firm is to advertise
exactly what we have to sell, and it is to
this fact tnut we owe our success."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1897.
WATER INQUIRY
WAXES WARMER
Dt\ Rottanzi and Mr. Schuss
ler Have a Passage
at-Arms*
AND THE CHAIRMAN INTERFERES.
The Water Committee Delegated to Make
an Examination of the Company's
Books and Report Later â Sec
retary Ames Gives
Evidence*
The water rales investigation waa con
tinued by the Board of Supervisors in
committee of the whole last night and
proved intensely interesting and dra
matic throughout.
Chief Engineer Schussler and Dr. Rot
tanzi were the principal actors during the
earlier portion of the proceedings, though
Mayor Phelan resumed the thread of
cross-examination somewhat later.
Supervisor Britt took the chair at 8
o'clock, in the temporary absence of the
Mayor, and immediately afterward re
signed it to Dr. Dodge, on the board resolv
ing itself into committee of the whole. Dr.
Clinton, the usual chairman, was not
present.
"What," asked the chairman, "is the
pleasure of the committee?"
"I move that Mr. Shussler take the
stand again," s-aid Dr. Rottanzi.
"I move," remarked Supervisor Delany,
"that he be allowed to continue, without
interruption, until he gets tbrougb."
"Is there any seconder to the motion,"
asked the chairman.
"1 will do so to expedite matters," said
Supervisor Haskius.
Dr. Rottanzi rose with a warning finger
uplifted. "I would like to know," said
he, "the object of this motion. I have
several questions to ask him end I do not
desire that 1 should be cut off from doing
so. I deem it of great importance that
the board should be acquainted with the
true facts of the case. If he is afraid to
answer them I do not see why I should
be deterred from asking them."
"This is to merely facilitate business,"
said Delany, "and as soon as Mr. Schuss-
ler is through we have no objection to
your asking questions."
"Is it your object," asked the chair, "to
prevent any interruption while he is mak
ing a statement in answer to a question
or to allow him to continue without being
questioned?"
Delany was understood to say that the
latter was bis proposal, wbile Haskins
leaned to the former interpretation.
"Well, that's all we desire," observed
Rnttanzi.
Supervisor Smith moved that the motion
be laid on tie table, but the committee
declined to take such action by a vote of
6 to 5. D--vany, Delany, Dodge, Morton,
Britt and Rivers voting in the negative,
Clinton being absent.
The committee tacitly accepted the
original motion.
Mr. Schussler said he would suggest to
Dr. Rottanzi the propriety of refraii.ing
from the statement that he (Schussler)
had failed to answer any questions.
"I prefer," be continued, "not to have
him make the slur tbat I try to evade
questions. I simply tell you the cold facts,
and that is all you will get from me. If
yon will be pleased to be more careful
with your statements after this â "
"I will refer you to the reporter's notes."
cried Roitanzi. "Those are sufficient for
me."
The chairman â Please come to order,
eentlemen. As it is a rule for members
not to address each other by name, I
would sucgest to the witness that he do
the name.
"It was not my desire to say anything,"
protested Rottanzi, "but when lam told
that I do not understand the question I
wish to say tbat I have studied it as thor
oughly as any member of ihe board, and
comprehend it probably too well to suit
some people."
â¢'I wish to tell Dr. RoUanzi," said Mr.
Schussler. warmly, "when be talks to me
not to shake his hands at me."
"Please come to order, gentlemen," ob
served the chairman, soothingly. "This
is really farcical."
Mr. Bchussier (turning to Dr. Rottanzi)â
On what subject do you wish me to ad
dress you?
Dr. Rottanziâ l believe during the last
meeting you slated in answer to a ques
\ tion that the City was really the gainer
by the company having purchased the
property on Stockton and Geary streets.
"I said," replied the witness, "that it
was a good business investment, and that
increasing business necessitated larger
offices."
Dr. Rottanziâ What were the profits of
the company on that investment?
"They only get a certain amount of rent
i out of that building, and in addition they
can charge themselves with a reasonable
I rate for that portion which they will oc
cupy themselves. With the two togethei
they will have an investment of 5 per
cent or over."
Dr. Rottanzi â What have been their
! profits since the property was acquired?
"They have been a good rental since the
Wigwam building was turnei over to
i them. They have received the rent for
that while it waa occupied."
Dr. Rottanziâ Do you consider the in
| create of value as profit?
"I think that should propeily be with
| profit. 1 '
Dr. Rottanriâ You also stated that it
was worth $300,000 to-uuy 1
"That," replied the witness, "was what
I had been told."
"In other words," said Rottanzi, "they
made a profit of $180,000."
"As soon as they have sold it and de
ducted the prohts they will know. I con
sider it was a prudent investment,
amounting to J l2O 000 purchase price.
Whatever the lot has improved in value
since tbat is the increase in the value of
the property. It compensates them for
such .- rate of interest as they have not
received on the investment from the be
ginning."
"I wish," the witness added, "you
would talk a little more respectfully to
me. "I am willing to answer any gentle
man's questions."
"I am as much a gentleman as any
body," shouted Dr. Rottanzi, angrily.
"If you do not," said the witness calmly,
"I shall refuse to answer you. Ido not
propose to be interrupted. Let me go on
with my answer. Now ask me questions."
'Do you consider." resumed Rottanzi,
"the difference of $180,000 as a profit?"
"I know nothing about $180,000. The
property has not yet been sold."
Supervisor Britt rose wearily. "At the
beginning," said he, "it was understood
that Mr. Schussler was to have an oppor
tunity to finish his answers. 1 do not
think he is on trial here, nor has he com
mitted any crime. 1 hold tbat he is en
titled to ana should be accorded the same
privilege as we would ieceive."
"That," observed Delany, "was my in
tention in offering tbat motion."
"I should like to know what we are
! here for," said Supervisor Smith. "We are
j here, I take it, to investigate, and we can
not do so in any other way than by ask
ing questions."
Dr. Rottanzi put another question, but
Mr. Sch ussier coldly requested him to
addre>s himself to the reporter, as he (Mr.
Schussler) would not longer reply to him
personally.
This was too much for Dr. Rottanzi.
"I Â«ay," he cried, shaking an admonitary
forefinger, "that this board shall demand
that he answer such questions as I ask
him. Haye you calculated the amount of
interest received from the water-rate pay
ers and the taxpayers upon the invest
ment of $120,000 by the company in that
piece of realty?"
"What rate of interest has been re
ceived from water-rate payers and taxpay
ers?" queried Mr. tcbussler. Here the
reporter read the question. "Well." re
plied the witness, "I don't know of any
water-rate payers or.toxpayers having paid
interest on that investment."
"Then," said Rottanzi, "you wish to
impiy that that was never counted in the
ii-t of properties upon which we base
water rates?"
"I never said that. You asked me
whether I bad ever calculated the rate cf
interest we had received from the water
rate payers and taxpayers en that invest
ment of $120,000 for that property."
"In other words," resumed Rottanzi, "I
want to know the amount you have re
ceived from the community at Jar.c pay
ing for water, upon the investment of
$120,000 by the water company in that
particular piece of property. It amounts
to-day to $155,000. That plus the actual
increase in the value of the prcpertv would
make it in the neighborhood of $275,000,
and that does not include the original
price, taxes and interest on taxes. 1 wish
to show that the wisdom of the company
in charging interest in the shape of water
rates hat not done justice to the com
munity, and that the company really owes
j the coinmun.ny a large sum of money."
Kritt did not think Dr. Kottanzi was
called upon to explain the question. They
wanted to henr Sir. Schussler and could
attend to Dr. Kottanzi later.
The chairman agreed with Britt and
suggested that Rottanzi's arguments
might be considered when the board
struck the rate.
Rottanxi then fired the following ques
tions at the witness:
"When were the water lots in Sausalito
i acquired?"
"I do not know."
"Was it previous to 1860?"
"I have no idea."
"Wno has an idea?"
â¢'I suppose our secretary. I believe I
stated before that I am the engineer of the
company and am ready to answer ques
tions pertaining to my department. IÂ»m
not a real estate expert or bookkeeper.''
"What is the total daily supply from
PiJarritO3, San Andreas and Crystal
Springs?"
"It varies every day. We can count on
18,000,000 gallons daily from those three
sources."
"What is the extent of those water
sheds?"
"In the neighborhood of thirty-seven
square miles or a little over. Between
thirty-seven and thirty-nine square
miles."
"And yon say the supply is 18,000,000
gallons?"
"2so. I say that the amount ol water
drawn from those three reservoirs year in
and year out for the last six or eight years
nas been in the neighborhood of 18,000,000
gallons daily."
Dr. Rottanzi then inquired about the
yield of the rainfall ana was informed
that this varied a great deal. Each por
tion of the watershed had a different rain
fall. If Dr. Rottanzi wanted to know the
average fall for the last five years at
Pilarcitos, he could figure it out. Rot
tanzi desired to know the average calcu
lated in the aggregate for say thirty years
at Crystal Springs. Mr. Schussler replied
that no record had been kept for so long.
The dam was only commenced in 1875.
The calculation was very complicated.
"I notice," said Rottanzi, "that you
have the comparative rainfall from Pilar
citos and San Andreas, but not from
Crystal Springs."
"That is only approximate. In the
year 1889-9U we had a very heavy rain fall
so unusually heavy as to be nearly as
large a* that of 1861-62, when the Sacra
mento Valley was Hooded. If you add
1889 90 to 1890-91 yon derive much too
high an average, because these heavy falls
only occur in twenty or thirty years. For
that reason, if I figure the average rain
fall in the watershed I figure on the ordi
nary and not the unusual years. Tell me
what document you have there."
"Oh," replied Rottanzi, "I have your
document."
"What year was it written In?"
"June 16. 1875."
"Well, in 1875 I conld not tell what the
year 1885 would bring."
This conversation continued some little
time longer, Mr. ScLussler explaining the
principle of rain absorption and evapora
tion.
In some years, he pointed out, a larger
proportion rearhed the reservoirs than in
others, the difference varying all the way
from 9-10 of 1 per cent to 27 per cent.
"I would make a suggestion," said Mr.
ScLussler. "If you want to get at the
running expenses it will take a great deal
of time. Our secretary is here to give
such explanations as full outside my de
partment. I handed Dr. Clinton .. list
some weeks ago of the running expenses
under thirty-one headings. If you want
those headings explained I can go ahead
with them."
Dr. Koctanzi asked his estimate of the
value of the Calaveras waterar.ed to-day.
"I told you before," rej lied Mr. Schuss
ler, "that lam not a lond expert. I think
it is worth a great deal of money. I would
not dare to say how much because we
would probably get our taxes raised in
Alaineda County. It is one of the best
purchases, including all of the Alameda
Greek and its water rights, that we ever
made."
"Do you realize," asked Rottanzi, "the
amount of taxes paid by San Francisco
on that purchase of your company ?"
The witness urged in reply the import
ance of the purchase. "You cannot realize
it," he said, "until you see how much
water can be drawn from it and the way
in which it has saved the City from the
consequences of drought. We have now
in our reservoirs a certain amount on
hand. If it had not been for our pumping
from ihe-e various ontside sources to the
extent we did we would not now have so
much water in our reservoirs. If the Ala
meda water had not been pumped it would
have run to was'e in the bay."
That source, he said, could now be
drawn from to the extent of 13,716,000,000
gallons altogether. He further discussed
the exorbitant prices exacted for land,
calculating that in onÂ« instance as much
as $4 and $5 had been paid per front foot.
"You do not admit, then, that you have
a pcssib'.e supply of nearly 50,000,000?"
Mr. Schussler replied in the negative.
It had been proved, he said, that the
sources of supply contained in these water
riehts were more incomplete than the
sources acquired at Alameda Creek, and it
â was, therefore, decided that the taking of
water from the latter was a' necessity.
"You need not shake your head/ he ob
served to Dr. Rottanzi ; "that is a fact."
"You formerly paid me the compliment
of saying that I wasan expert calculator,"
rejoined Rottarizi, smilinely, "but I see
that lam not in it with you. I see why
you are employed by the company."
Mr. Schussler, resuming his testimony
without further questioning, said that
when the company was organized it was
merely required by law to supply the
citizens with water, nothing whatever be
ing said about pressure. If the water
were delivered at the level of the
sidewalk they would be with n the
limit of the law. The luxury of a high
pressure was the item involving so
much of the expense, necessitating
as it did four or five pumping stations.
He c'a ; med credit for the company on the
score of the care bes towed upon pipe con
struction and the subsequent renewal of
the streets ana sidewalks. Capital, he
continued, was the most cowardly thing
m the world and would not move unless
it could get a safe rate of interest Mr.
Schussler proceeded to argue nt some
length that any reduction of interest by
the board on the company's shares, to say
5 per cent, would only hurt the investor.
"The City and the ratepayer," he said,
"have to pay the same whether you put it
at 6, 5 or 4 per cent."
"You refer now," said the Mayor," to
the monf-y you will have to raise to pay
for new construction?"
"No, sir. I made a hypothetical case.
Say in the case of the Crystal Springs
reservoir."
"That's ancient history," retorted the
Mayor.
"We wit I require $300,000 or $400 000 for
new consiruction this year. 1 wanted lo
illustrate that you do not make thÂ» City
the gainer or the ratepayer by reducirrp
the rate of interest. I think you are fully
convinced yourself."
"No." replied the Mayor, "I am not."
"Then," rejoined the witness, "1 am
sorry."
"You claim," resumed the Mayor, "that
if 5 per cent were allowed upon the money
you required you would have to sell at 80.
For the purpose of new construction you
borrow in the open market. What rate of
interest do you pay on your lioatinc
debt?"
"I don't know."
"Don't you know that you have never

paid 6 per cent and that it has averaged 4
and i} 4 per cent?"
'"I know nothing about the rate of in
terest paid by the company on a note. A.
note of the company is entirely different
from the issuance of stock, and is secured
by the pood name and credit of the com
pany. If they borrow money at 2 per cent
I don't blame them. But that cuts no
figure here. If you make a sweeping re
duction on ail the shares I maintain that
it wiltf reduce their selling value, and I
know from my own observation that peo
ple in thft East and Europe do not want
them. They want our bonds. Those
bonds are at par because they are secured
by all the property of the company. But
the shares are subject to the whim of
every new board that comes in."
'"You don't mean to say," said the
Mayor, "that if the interest is reduced to
5 per cent more money will have to be
raised from the ratepayers of the City?
If we in our judgment fixed the rate at 5
per cent on your stock that you would re
quire to raise more mocey from the rate
payers?"
"1 say that if the rates were reduced to
5 per cent then we would have to sell more
shares. I want to set him right," added
Mr. Schussler, addressing the board apolo
getically, "because he is a young man.
[Laughter.] If a certain amount of iuoney
is required for purposes of construction
or purchase, etc., and we have to raise it
by seliinc stock we will get much less for
our shares at 5 per cent interest than at 6
per cent and we> will have to sell a great
many more shares at 5 per cent than at 6
per cent in order to obtain a given sum of
money."
PeluamW. Ames, the secretary of the
company, was then called to the stand to
give figures on the bonds and stocks of
the company. He stated that there were
59,975.000 in bonds outstanding, $5,00J,000
bearing 4 per cent interest and the rest 6
per cent.
He stated that the company issued these
bonds to pay a floating indebtedness on
which it paid SJ-.' to 6 per cent interest.
Mr. Ames stated that the company held
stocks amounting t0 53,200,000 which could
be sold to cancel lnileDte mess, such as the
cost of constructing the new building on
Stockton and Geary streets.
Mayor Phelan then went on to the
question of the expense account of the
company and asked the amount of com
pensation received by the directors of the
company. Attorney Keliosg for the cor
poration objected to the question on the
ground that it would be detrimental to the
discipline of the company.
Mayor Phelan said that he desired to
find ouc whether the salaries paid were
greater than those paid to the < Iticers of
other corporations of the kind, so that it
might be judged whether or not the affairs
of the company werÂ« economically con
ducted.
Supervisor Smith moved that the sala
ries account b* accepted as being correct,
and that the company be not compelled
to make public such figures as would be
detrimental to its interests.
Mayor Phelan objected to any drawing
back by the toardfrom the position it had
taken in the matter, and asked that the
secretary be compelled to answer the
questions.
Attorney Kellosrg accused the Mayor of
curiosity in the questions he a^ked, and
stated that the City was concerned only in
the question as to whether the works were
conducted economically in the aggregate.
It made no difference, be said, how much
any one employe received. He respect
fully insisted that the questions be not
pressed.
Engineer Schussler produced fignres to
show that the running expenses had been
reduced year by year from 1888 to the
present time, though the business of the
company had largely been increased.
Mayor Phelan stated that there was an
apparent subterfuge in the statement of
the company regarding the salaries of its
officials inasmuch at the total of the
; enumeration of seventeen officials was
given as over $64,000 per year, while six
directors, making up the total, only re
ceived, as he understood, $40 per
month each. The circumstance showed
that the average of eleven of the officials
must be very high, and he wanted to
know how it was divided, whether the
Balaries were higher than they should be.
Supervisor Smith's motion was amended
by Supervisor Delany to provide that the
company be required to furnish the infor
mation to the board in executive session.
Both motion and amendment were lost,
and Mayor Phelan asked the salary re
ceived by the president of the company.
Attorney Kellogg instructed the secre
tary not to answer, on the grouna that it
would endanger the interests of the com
pany. He said, however, that the board
could send a committee to Bee the books,
and that it would be given free access to
them, provided the members would give
their words not to make public what
they saw.
Mayor Phelan said he was familiar with
what was in the books, but wanted the
figures given as testimony so that it
would go on the record.
A motion by Britt to reconsider was lost
and a motion t>y Haskins that a com
mittee of live be appointed to co into the
company's books was carried by a vote of
9 to 2, Sheehan and Rottanzl voting in
the negative. Chairman Dodge placed
the matter in the hands of the Water
Committee. Supervisor Kottanzi wanted
meetings held every day bo that the
matter couid be closed up by the end of
the month, but others objected and when
the doctor tried to insist he was hooted
by the other Supervisors.
The committee adjourned until next
Monday evening.
Grady Mayhem Caae.
The case of Attorney W. D. Grady, charged
with biting off the ear of James Schaefer, a
waiter in the Orpheum, was called in Judge
Joachimsen's courr again yesterday afternoon.
Grady asked for another continuance, as he
had been compelled at the last moment to sub
stitute ex-JuJxe Levy as his attorney Instead
of W. W. Foote. Attorney Ackerman, for the
prosecution, said he had no objections to a
reasonable continuance, and the Judge said
he would set a time for peremptorily hearing;
the case to-morrow morning.
