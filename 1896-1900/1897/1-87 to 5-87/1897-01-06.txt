VOLUME LXXXI.â NO. 37.
SHORTAGE'S STRENGTH GROWS HOURLY,
The Perkins Conference Is Held, but Fails
to Secure Enough Votes for
His Nomination. .
This Is Considered a Victory for the Popular
Orator and Leader, and His Friends
Are Joyful.
âº Demonstrations Show That the Bulldozing Tactics of Perkins' Managers Will
Not Avail, and That the Honest Legislators of California Will Refuse
to Return the Incumbent Senator to Washington.
Several Gentlemen Who Attended the Caucus Stated That They Went In With the
Understanding That It Was to Be a Friendly Conference of Repub
licans, and That Unless There Were Sixty-One Votes They Would
Not Be Bound by the Action of the Caucus. They Ex
plicitly Said That If the Majority Was to Bind
Them They Would Not Attend.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan, s.â Senator Perkins' ships did not come in
last night. They were caught in a gale and were stranded on a bleak and
rocky shore.
All that could be mustered was fifty-seven votes, and not another one
was in sight.
The crew are completely demoralized and hardly know where to look
for shore. ,
Scores of people visited the headquarters of Samuel M. Shortridge to
night and congratulated him upon the splendid victory which he had
achieved.
PERKINS MEN ROUTED.
They Line Up In Caucus, but Do Not
Have Enough Votes to
Nominate.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Jan. s.â The Per
kins forces lined up in caucus to-nipht
and were utterly routed.
Instead of the siaty-three or sixty-four
votes which they boasted they had the
rollcall showed only fifty-seven, four less
than the necessary majority, and one of
those votes was a proxy.
When the members of the caucus filed
out of the room into the crowded lobby
their faces wore a smile sicklied o'er by
the pale cast of disappointment, and in
order to cover their confusion they an
nounced that they had received sixty votes
and that they could get a few more when
ever they wanted them.
It was a great victory for the opposition
and it showed a part of the strength of the
contestant, Samuel M. Shortridge. The
Perkins adherents utterly failed to get. a
majority of the Legislature to attend or '
abi'ie by the caucus. They had been j
workine for days and nights with a full
and well trained corps of political whip
pers-in. They had run through the Capitol
building, they had ransacked the hotels,
the sidewalKs, the saloons, they had even j
gone to private houses; they had gath
ered, corraled, bulldozed, cajoled, prom
ised to do everything and anything in or
der to gather together a suriicient number
of Republicans to nominate Mr. Perkins,
yet while they worked the strength of Mr.
Shortrid c was gaining.
For months they had traveled up and
down theÃtate, attending county conven
tions, political meetings and visiting leg
islators before and after election to gain
recruits for ti.eir rasn. They had the Ex
aminer and tbe Record-Union at their
backs and despite all their well-directed
and most desperate efforts, Mr. Shortridge
succeeded in blocking the caucus and in
preventing a majority vote for his op
ponent.
It is hailed with joy by the friends of
Mr. Shortridge as a decisive Victory, not
withstanding the bulldozing and misreD
Mr' Lynch, Speaker Leon Dennery. Sig Eetman's Smile. Mr. Markley, Secretary
of the Last House. Board of Examiners.
The Call
resentations of the other side. They are
in hiih feather to-night and are receiving
congratulations on every bund.
It Had been announced early in the day
that sixty-three or sixty-four legis:ators
had signed the call for the caucus and
that their choice was Senator Perkins,
but only fifty-seven vo'es were the pro
ceeds of toe caucus. After the adjourn
ment a roilcall was exhibited to the mem
bers of the press purporting to represent
sixty votes.
Senator Gleaves was selected as chair
man of the caucus and Assemblyman Bel
shaw as secretary. When the object of
the meeting had been stated Judge Way
mire of Alameda arose and said that he
appeared there as a Republican and in
the interest of harmony and the success of
the Republican party.
"We nave eainea a great victory in this
State and Nation for that grand party and
the peerless statesman, William McKin
ley," he said, "and it now rests with the
Republicans elected by the people to fit
tingly carry out tbe good purpose of the
Republican party by electing some dis
tinguished Republican as the next Repub
lican Senator. We have met here for the
purpose of considering the first steps to
that end. I appear here as I always have j
appeared â as tbe friend of Senator fer
kins, and I am pleased to say, also, that I
am here as the friend of every leading
gentleman who aspires to the high and
honorable position of Senator, and in the
interest of the Republican party to pro
mote that harmony which is needed for
future success.
"I am advised by leading members of
the Lepislature and by citizens through
out tbe State that it would be unwise for
us to take any hasty action in this impor
tant matter. I therefore think it wise
that we should take a short adjournment,
al Jeast until to-morrow evening, that all
the aspirants for the office of Senator may
have an opportunity of presenting their
claims to the members of this body. I
beiieve this postponement would create
harmony and would redound 1o the honor
and the interest of Senator Perkins ana
1 his friends, and particularly to the party
SAN FRANCIÂ«CO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, JANUARY 6, 1897.
whose representatives *ye are. I therefore
move that this body adjourn until to
morrow evening at 8 o'clock, and in doing
this I aim only, as I have indicated be
fore, to bring harmony out of discord, and
to unite solely for one man and with the
concurrence of the entire body of Repub
licans represented in both branches of the
Legislature. I have voted for Benator
Perkins before, and took an active part in
his election, and I think that no man can
accuse me here of not having proved in
the most unmistakable manner my friend
ship for him.
"1 have been complimeuted by many
members of the House and Senate by sug
gesting my name fora Dosition in the
Cabinet. I desire to assure you all that I
highly appreciate this honor. If 1 can in
any way aid in the organization and per
petuation of the Republican party and its
principles, and purely in the interest of
hnrmony in the party, and without any
selfish motive whatever, I assume my
present attitude in this matter."
Cutter of Yuba opposed the motion to
adjourn and made a long s, eech. He
said that there was not a Republican pres-.
ent who was not there in behalf of Senator
Perkins. Why should they delay the
nomination any longer. I: was the wish
of tne people of California that the Re
publican representatives stiould vote for
him. It was their wiÂ«h and their will, re
peated Mr. Cutter. He did not believe in
postponing action for even one minute.
"We all know," he added, "t.. at there
are other candidates who wou'd be glad
to see the election of Senator Perkins pre
vented, and this delay, in my opinion, i?
simply for the purpose of saving time for
the benefit of the opposition, it is the
will of the people of this State, and if the
Republicans who have chosen not to at
tend this caucus knowing as they do that
it is the people's will, and do not choose
to vote for him, well and good."
Other Bpeakers followed, and the mo
tion for postponement having failed of
passage Senator Perkins was placed in
nomination, and tbe roll was called, re
suiting in 57 votes, including the proxy of
Sims to Ennis.
SAMUEL M* SHORTRIDGE, the Candidate for United States Senator, Whose
Election Would Promote Harmony in the Republican Party and Be a Credit to the
State of California*
Then some one said that they ought to
have sixty votes, and it was accordingly
eiven out to the pross as sixty votes for
Senator Perkins â not enough to elect him.
When the news became known on the out
side, scores of people â legislators and
others â nocked to Samuel M. Ehortridge's
heail quarters in the Golden Eagle Hotel
to tender him their congratulations.
The Perkins people count upon one or
two more votes, but these have been al
ready gathered in by Mr. Sbortridge and
the outlook is rather bleak for them. The
coup d'etat by which the majority of the
caucus was blocked, and in fact broken up,
is the talk of the street to-night.
JACKSON A BULLDOZER.
Peculiar Insult to Judsre Waymire
While He Is Talking to Some
Friends.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 5.â A scene
of attempted bullciozin ? without a paral
lel for intrusion was witnessed by a num
ber of centlemen who were standing in a
little alcove of the State Capitol rotunda
at 8:30 o'clock this evening. Judge James
A. Wnymire, Assemblyman from Ala
meda, left the Senatorial caucus in the
Supreme Court room to confer with H. I.
Kowalsky and some of the latter's associ
ates. Judge Waymire carve out of the
caucus on his own motion and was ex
tending bis hand to Charles M. Snort
ridge, when Colonel J. P. Jackson
brusquely stepped forward, exclaiming in
an angry tone to Judge Waymire, 'If you
want to see me you must ?ee me now, as I
am busy nnd going upstairs."
Jud^e Waymire replied in a mild and
gentlemanly manner that he had come
out to ?peak to his friends, pointing to
Charles M. Shortridgc, Fremont Oider,
managing editor of the Bulletin, and Col
onel H. I. Kowolsky. Colonel Jackson
waved his hand impressively toward the
caticus-room and exclaimed, in a husky
and r.ngry tone:
"If you hare anything to say to me,
speak at once and go back."
Judge Waymire protested that the
amenities of politics required him to ex
plain. Jackson then became more ex
cited, and, in an impatient manner, re
plied :
"If you want to maintain your self
respect you will go back to the caucus.
You have nnly two minutes to decide."
Judge Waymire is a highly sensitive
man, yet slow to wrath, but he smarted
under the lash of the Perkins whip as
Jackson cracked it over his head and about
his oars. The insult was more than he
could endure, and he sepmed to be ready
to spring at his insulter. He shook his
finger in Jackson's face and retorted: "I
will not take any instructions from you,
Colonel JacKson."
Charles M. Shortridee, not â wishing to
embarrass Judge Waymire, withdrew a
few steps, exclaiming: "I do not desire to
be a party to any sensation in the lobby."
Had the high-minded and self-respect
ing Republicans in tne caucus witnessed
this unparaFleJed scene of bulldozing as
did the gentlemen outside they would
have been surprised and grieved.
When the Deople of Alameda County
read of this remarkable scene they will
feel that every man, woman and child of
Waymire' s constituency has been griev
ously insulted. Tbe incident is not over
drawn or highly colored. It was witnessed
by a number of spectators.
DONE IN THE SENATE.
Approval of the Resolution Asking
for Protection on California
Fruits.
SAC-KAMENTO, Cal., Jan. s.â The
Senate convened promptly at 10 o'clock,
and Rev. Mr. Miel delivered the first
prayer of the session.
Immediately thereafter Senator An
drous presented a joint resolution to in
struct the Congressional delegation at
Washington to urge the incorporation in
the'tnriff bill now being prepared by the
Congressional committee of a provision
which will afford protection to California
iruits from foreign competition and se
cure a home market at reasonable prices.
In order that there might be no delay,
the Congressional committee being In
session at Washington to-day, the reso
lution was adopted without reference.
It was sent to the Assembly to be adopted
by that body and telegraphed at once to
Senators and members of the House.
The Senate then adjourned to 11:30.
The Governor's message was read in the
Senate and made the special order for
10 o'clock 10-morrow.
The temporary committee on mileace
and attaches was niimed, consisting of
Holloway, Bull and Henderson.
The Senate then adjourned to 10 o'clock
to-morrow.
EDITOR SCIPIO CRAIG Docs the Lobby Act,
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
WORK IN THE ASSEMBLY.
Resolutions Asking- Congress to
Oppose the Refunding Scheme
Are Passed.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. s.â The As
sembly settled down to business without2
any formality this morning. Directly
after the opening prayer by the chaplain
North of Alameda offered a resolution
excluding all save members and attaches
of the Assembly from the floor, and the
rule of the Hous-e was enforced.
Breiling, Fontana, Goodhue, Treacy and
Burnett were appoiuted a Committee on
Mileage.
By resolution the contingent expenses
were fixed at $25 per member.
The Assembly considered such topics as
the free coinage of silver, the construc
tion of the Nicaragua canal, the annexa
tion of the republic of Hawaii, the refund
ing of the Pacific railroad debts, the tariff
on fruits and many otner subjects of
minor importance.
Assemblyman J, B. Sanford of Point
Arena was the author of the free coinage
of siiver resolutions. They are identical
with the resolutions adopted by both
houses of the Legislature two years ago.
They were referred to tfce Committee on
Federal Relations. The same reference
was made of Caminetti's resolution to
annex Hawaii. The canal resolution intro
duced by Assembyman Hudson of Monte
rey was also sent to Federal Relations
Commmittee.
The Governor's message, accompanied
by toe report of the Capitol Commission
ers, was presented in due time.
Such haste or commendable progress
in the dispatch of business was made that
the Assembly was able to take up Senate
messages.
The resolution adopted by the Senate
yesterday asking Congress to protect the
products of California orchards in the
tariff measure now being framed in Wash
ington received the concurrence of the
Assembly without a dissenting vote. It
was a remarkable and to the Republi
cans a most gratifying event to observe
the Democrats and Populists, every one of
them, voting; for a straight-out resolution
for the protection of American industry.
Assemblyman Uridgford, Populist and
Democrat from Colusa, incidentally ob
served tliat if protection was going round
he wanted some oi it for Caiiiornia.
The Assembly took a recess at 12:30 and
convened again at 2:30 p. M. No time was
lost in proceeding to a consideration of
the anti-funding resolution--. During the
recess the Republican caucus examined
into the merit of tho measure agreed
upon by the committee last night and
found that it accorded with their views.
Belshaw, therefore, presented th"? fol
lowing as a substitute for hi-s own original
resolution and the substitute by Carni
netti introduced yesterday:
Whereas, There is a bill now pending in
Congress, a mensure known as the Powers-
Gear bill, which has for its object the refund
ing of the debts of certain Ooverument-aided
rai'roads; and whereas, any scheme for re
funding the Pacific railroads indebtedness to
the United States Government, or any exten
sion of the time for payment of the same,
must result in maintaining an excessive capi
talization of these roads, thus requiring high
Tates of fares and freights to meet the interest
payments thereon, to the great burden and
disadvantage of the psopie of the state of Cali
fornia; therefore be it
Senlved, By the Assembly of the State of
California, the Senate concurring, that we are
unalterably opposed to any and all extensions
of the time of payment of said debts and also
to the Powers-Gear bili, or nny other bill of
like import, and we hereby instruct our Sena
tors and request our Representatives in Con
gress to oppose, by all honorable means, the
enactment of any such measure. And be it fur
ther
Ecuolvcd, That we favor the immediate col*
lection, on maturity, of said debts, or in the
event the same cannot be collected, then we
urge the enforcement oi existing laws of the
United Slates concerning this question. And
be it further
Resolved, That the Governor be requested to
immediately transmit by telegraph a copy of
these resolutions to our Congressional delega
tion at Washington.
Caminetti said he agreed entirely with
the foregoing substitute, but he offered
the following as a supplemental report:
Mr. Speaker: The undersigned are in full ac
cord and agree to the substitute reported by
the committee, but favor the addition thereto
of the following:
Andbe it further resolved, That the petition
in b.-half of the State of California for a
hearing before the respective committees of
Congress having jurisdiction of the subject
be presented, and the Senate and House of
Representatives of the Tutted States are each
hereby further petitioned to recommit the
measure now under consideration and delay
action thereon until such hearing can be had.
Respectfully submitted, A. Camisetti,
William Jlead.
Caminetti made an extended speech
dwelling chiefly on the statement that
California had been deprived of the op
portunity to present the case of the peo
ple to tne Congressional committees. He
quoted from railroad statistics to show
the immense and fraudulent capitaliza
tion of the Pacific roads in eeneral and the
Central Pacific in pÃrticui.ir. In the case
of the Central Pacific he figured the false
capitalization at $172,000,000, observing
thai the refunding measure pending in
Congress meant that the people of Cali
fornia would have to sustain the burden
of paying interest on this stupendous
sum.
Caaiinetti referred to a divided Cali
fornia delegation in Congress, and spoke
of the unfaithful conduct of one Repre
sentative. He insisted that California
should invoke the sacred right of petition
ing as a sovereign State, and asking to be

heard in opposition to the funding
scheme. He asserted that the State was
now confronted by an extraordinary con
dition of affairs. Reference was made to
a recent decision of a Federal court, in
which the power of ti.e California Rail
road Commissioners to adjust rates had
been denied. He interpreted the decision
to mean that rates of freight might be
made to pay interest on the false and
monstrous capitalization of $172,000,000.
Assemblyman Cutter of Yuba saw no
objection whatever to the adoption of
Caminetti's supplemental report.
Dryden presented a substitute provid
ing for Government ownership, and the
operation of the roads for the benefit of
the whole people. He spoke in support
of his position.
Belshaw feared that a declaration in
favor of Government ownership of the
roads would do the cause of the people of
California, at this time, more harm than
good. He understood that many Con
gressmen in the East were strongly op
posed to Government control and man
agement.
Assemblyman Emmons of Kern really
believed the Government should take and
operate the roads, but he doubted the wis
dom of expressing that conviction. There
was danger in asking too much, as many
people in tlie East were inclined to regard
Californians as a race of hoodlums.
Assemblyman Burnett of Kern desired
to strike from the substitute all reference
to the immediate collection of the debt.
After further debate Belsbaw accepted
the Caniinetti supplement. The amend
ments offered by Dryden and Burnett

were rejected and the substitute report as
agreed on in Republican caucus, includ
ing Caminetti's substitute, prevailed.
The next scene of the day was the intro
duction of bills. Howard Wright of Ala
meda got in number one, an appropria
tion for the deaf an-i dum asylum.
Henry C. Dibble came next with seven
bills.
Eighty-three bills were introduced.
Many large appropriations are involved.

Diego, Cal., calls for $75,000.
PROPOSED LEGISLATION.
Colonel Shaw May Be Authorized
to Construct a Blgr Citrus Arch
at Washington.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. s.â Colonel
Henry G. Shaw of Stockton is here for the
purpose of asking an appropriation of
$3000 to be expended in the construction
of a big citrus arch in Washington on the
occasion of the inauguration of the Presi
dent, the arch to serve a twofold purpose
â to honor the Pre-ident and to advertise
the resources of California. The structure
will be of redwood and will be covered
with oranges, lemons and raisins arranged
in fanciful designs with appropriate mot
toes of a non-partisan character.
The members with whom Colonel Shaw
have conversed have expressed them
selves fa/orably in the matter, and there
is no doubt that the appropriation will be
made. The colonel is a well-known news
paper writer and 13 an old soldier, carry
ing yet as a memento of the war a minie
rifle bullet received at the battle of
Chickamauga. He is not wearing it next
his heart and done up in a neat packet of
silk and satin, but be is carrying it where
he can't lose itâ in the middle of his rig ht
lung.
A bill will be introduced in a few days
for the appointment of an official short
hand reporter in each branch of the Leg
islature to take down the proceedings and
the speeches of the members. If this
should become a law it will be necessary
to prolong the session by six months, in
order to allow all the orators an opportu
nity of being beard and of being written
down to posterity in undecipherable hen
scratches. If the speeches should be
primed wha,t a magnificent library would
they not make! There is no doubt that
in that vast collection of volumes, which
will be equal in size to the greai Alexan
drian library, now alas ! lost to the world,
there will be found wisdom greater than
that of Solomon, eloquence zreater than
that of Burke, Phillips, Fox or Demos
thenes and a knowledge of human nature
and the science of government beside
which that of Herbert Spencer would be
only a kindergarten.
Mr. Demosthenes was no great shakes
anyhow. He had so much wÂ©ol in his
chest notes that he was obliged to fill his
F. R. StanselL
tt H. North.
mouth with pebbles in order to digest his
articulation, just as you fill the crop of a
chicken with gravel. When he becamÂ»*a
member of the Athenian Legislature from
Ninety-fifth Assembly District, he was
known to take bribes from one party with
the right hand and from the opposing
party with the left. Then when the matter
came to a vote, he wrapped his throat in
red flannel, bought a physician's certificate
to the effect that he was suffering from
clergyman's sore throat, and went into
the country shooting snipe.
The salary for these official reporters,
should the bill pass, will be $10 a day for
taking aown the speeches, but when Smith
of the Eighty-second accuses Jones of the
Ninety-seventh of having used incendiary
language on the day before, Jones will
hotly call upon the reporter to furnish
the transcript of the whole SDeech in order
that he may hurl it in the teeth of Smith
at a further cost to the State of 20 cents
per 100 words.
Senator White will ask for an appropri
ation of $5000 to be used in preparing an
exhibition of California fruit and other
products at the Central American Expo
sition in Guatemala, wfcicu will open on
March 15. It is not tnoucht 4hat there
will be any serious opposition to the bill,
as it is believed that the value of the ex
penditure will be much more than made
up by the good which the advertisement
will confer upon California.
CAMINETTI IS WARNED.
Republican Caucus Resolutions on
Refunding May Do Injury to
the Cause.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. s.â The fol
lowing was received by Mr. Caminetti
to-Dight:
San FraKcisco, January 5, 1897.
Hon. A. Caminetti, Assembly. Sacramento: Re
publican caucus resolutions on anti-iunding
are calculated to do the causa great injury.
There is no proposition involved of Govern
ment ownership. The roads, If sold at Ruction,
will find bidders and pass into competitive
hands. Such resolutions will only repel East
ern sentiment, and if offered in good faith
snoold be at once corrected. We have so lit a
similar telegram to Mr. Belshaw. Senator
Perkins' friends should be warned of the dan
ger of such proceedings.

SIR CHARLES TUPPER TALKS.
His Audience at a London Dinner Said
the United States Would Never
Get Canada.
LONDON, Enq., Jan. s.â Sir Charles
Tupper, formerly Canadiun High Coru
miss oner to Great Britain and more re
cently Frime Minister to Canada, which
office he resigned on July 8 last; Sir Rob
ert George Wyndham Herbert, who was
permanent Under Secretary of State for
the colonies from 1870 to 1892, and who is
now Agent-General for Tasmania, and the
Hon. Duncan Gilles, Agent-General for
Victoria, were the guests of honor this
evening at a banquet given at the St.
George Ciub of this city.
Major-General Sir Owen Burne presided
in the absence of Lord Loch, formerly
Governor of Cape Colony and her Majes
ty's High Comiuissioher to South Africa.
Amon^ those present were Sir Donaid
Smith, Canadian High Commissioner to
Great Britain; A. G. June-, Sanford Flem
ing, Major John W. Laurie, M. P.. who was
at one time a colonel in the Canadian mili
tia, and Rufus Pope, a member of the
Canadian Parliament.
General Burns in toasting Sir Charles
Tupper made a lengthy reference to hia
distinguished career. In replying to the
toast Sir Charles said that he did not go
from London to Canada for the purpose
of succeeding Sir Mackenzie Bowell in ihe
premiership, but that he was summoned
by the latter to confer with the Govern
ment on iniDoriant business connected
with Canada and the empire. He had
been reluctantly drawn into politics when
he thought he bad retired from an active
political life. The Liberr-1 and Con>erva
tive parties in Canada had asked him to
re-enter the arena.

1888, respecting the American fisheries,
Sir Charles paid a high tribute to the tact
and ability of Joseph Chamberlain, now
Secretary of State for the Colonies, who
was one of the Treaiy Commissioners.
Referring to the situation in Canada,
Sir Charles said that if the Dominion were
isolated it must fall into the lap of the
United States. He greatly admired the
United States, but was profoundly con
vinced that union with Great Britain was
the only true security for real liberty to
all parties.
The United States, he added, desired to
absorb Canada. [Cries of "Tney will never
get it"]. The Canadian fisheries were tie
chief attraction for the United States and
the minerals of the Dominion was another.
Canada could give the United States the
finest harbors in the world, besides bring
ing that country 600 miles nearer to Great
Britain.
He contended that Canada's deep-seated
loyalty to Great Britain would always be
an impassable barrier to absorption. Sir
Charles spoke in praise of Sir Donald
Smith, his successor in the Canadian com
missionership, who, he said, was highly
esteemed by all parties in Cinada. His
reference to Sir Donald was greeted with
cheers.
LOOKS LIKE MADDEN.
Illinois' Speaker Elected by the Machine
Which Backs the Chicago
Candidate.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Jan. s.â Edward
C Curtis of Grant Park, Kankakee
County, was nominated for Speaker at a
caucus to-night of the Republican mem
bers of the lower house. The majority of
votes for him assures his elecHon.
He was the choice of the State machine,
which is backing Alderman Madden of
Chicago for United States Senator, and
the result of the caucus is taken by the
machine leaders and their followers in the
Legislature as a forecast of the election of
Madden. The lines in the Speakership
fight were cJearly drawn for and against
the machine.
E. G. Schubert of Cook County has re
ceived the promise of the machine sup
port, but at an all-night meeting of the
leaders it waÂ» seen that bis candidacy was
hurting the prospects of Madden, and,
after Governor-elect Tanner had arrived
betore daylight this morning from Chicago
to straighten out the tangle, it was de
cided to drop trie Chicago man with his
consent and take up Curtis.
This move was a surprise to everybody
when they awoke this morning. Charles
Allen of Vermillion County also withdrew
in favor of Curtis. Selby became a candi

GALLAGHER LOST BY A FLUKE.
BrokJ His Arm After He Had Burns at
His Mercy in Their Go at
Los Angeles.
LOS ANGEL.ES, Cal., Jan. s.â By acci
dent, Billy Gallagher broke his right arm
to-night in his fight with J. Burns before
the Los Angeles Athletic Club, and had to
retire. He had his opponent at his mercy
and would have finished him in that
round.
The fight was for fifteen rounds. la the
third Gallagher began on Burns and
knocked him down with a blow on the
jaw. In the fourth round Gallagher
feinted with his left end scored a clean
knockdown with a right swing on the
jaw.
Burns took his ten seconds. Gallagher
npain swung his right on the jaw and
Burns fell toward Gallagher, who hit him
witn a light left as he came. Burns went
down on his hands and knees.
There were cries of loul from Burns'
seconds and the time-keeper counted
Burns out, but the referee, after a wrangle,
ordered the men together again. Burns
by this time had recovered slightly and
staggered toward Gallagher when time
was called. Burns was really out in this
round.
In the fifth round Gallagher started in
to finish his man, and hit Burns a right
and lett. He swung his left for the head,
but missed, his wrist going hard against
the back of Burrs' head, breaking the arm.
Gallagher then fiddled and allowed
Burns to pick up, greatly to the surprise
of the spectators. Gallagher easily
avoided Burns' rushes, but did not at
tempt to land.
In the next round, after some feints and
rushes on the part of Burns, which Gal
lagher evaded, the referee announced that
Gallagher could not go on as he had
broken his arm.
Tho fight was awarded to Burns.
WOLCOTT'S VISIT.
London Not Excited, but Will Receive Him
Cordially â The Silver Talk
There.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. s.â The Tri
bune to-morrow will publish the follow
ing cablegram from its correspondent in
London: The approaching visit of Sen
ator \Volcott to London is not discussed
by the press, but bankers and practical
financiers are talking about it quietly
among themselves and are not inclined to
dismiss it as a political maneuver.
He wiU certainly be received with un
usual cordiality. Bimetallists will wel
come him and eagerly exchange views
with him.
The financial situation, however, is fa
vorable iv one respect for promoting the
objects of Senator Wolcott's mission.
The export of gold from England to Inaia
which has been forecast by snrewd ob
servers lor several weeks has begun. Tne
amount of gold is not large yet, but with
the continuance of the money stringency
in India and with exchanges so high ih .it
gold can be profitably imported in pay
ment for merchandise it is probable that
the movement will last for several
months.
I learned on excellent authority that
there have been informal conferences be
tween Ie financial authorities of the
British Government and the officers of the
Bank of England and other prominent
bankers, and that three concessions on
the silver question have been suggested Â»s
possible in any conference with Senator
Wolcott or in negotiations with the
American Government. The y are: First,
the speedy reopening of the Indian mint*
for the coinage of silver; second, the coin
age outright of $5,000,000 worth in silver in
England; third, an increase of silver de
posits in the bank of England to the ex
tent of 25 per cent of the reserve.
These three concessions .have been cer
tainly discusscd.qnietly, although neither
the Bank of England nor the Government
is committed in any way to a formal offer
f o Senator Wolcott or to any representa
tiveofthe American Government. Ihis
probably represents the limit to which
England will go. Bimetallism is hardly
witnin the range of possibilities. So lar
as England is concerned an international
conference is highly impracticable unless
a definite basis of ection is proposed in the
orm of a new ratio between gold and
silver. The conditions of Indian finance,
however, make it r>os ible for the sake of
reopening the Indian mints and easing
the situation.

S ate Insti:nt:ons, Commission?
and on Taxation.
a. SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. s.â Governor
Badd'a first biennial message to the Leg
tnre was presented to that body to
day. Its main poi:its are as follows:
The Governor recalled with satisfaction the
p: sperity of Ihe State during the last two
years its freedom from domestic disturbance,
;â - . ace and disaster.
V^ri.-tlon of Salaries and Employes.
rring to his inaugural address he said
, r. commented on the extent of the State
Lvasance. The State Board of Examiners
one much tocorrect these evils, but much
remains to be done. The State board found
ries for tbe same service instate iustitu
disproportton&te, in some cases nearly
double those of others, and the number of em
ployea excessive; that attendants In various
asylums vary greatly in the ratio of inmates,
the payrolls were augmented by
- if dollars, while the number of pa
- remained stationary or decreased. Ihis
of uniformity he shows by mentioning
blowing salaries : Superintendent of the
State insane asylum at Stockton, $3500 and
- jiorintendent of the State reform
'â¢â¢ bitlier, $3000 and found: superin
tendentof the Home for Feetlt-minded Chil
at Glen Ellen, "where tne work
long and delicate," $2400 and
fou:. intendent of the Preston
ol oi Industry, $2400 and iouud.
c the salaries of cooks and certain other
enu>loyes vary es muon as from 30 to 50 per
i â¢ Tne salaries of State institution officials
cqua:, and frequently exceed, those of consti
â¡ai Sate officers who are required to
possess -peeinl training, undergo the expense
of a campaign, etc. Had the State Board of
Examiners power to reduce the number of
Institution officers and employes the re
reductlon in expenses through its fcuper
t yen more significant.
He suggested that such power be civen the
vernor'a understanding fails to
prehend why beef at Whittier should be
i, i cents a pound and beel at Baa Bernardino
4 : . cents to stale institutions, a:. d a similar
v.'.iation in prices of other commodities.
State Taxss.
In regard to the taxation of corporations the
Governor say-: â¢-! would therefore recom-
I : lend that, under artic c XIII, section 11, of
\ he constitution, you formulate aud impose,
unon all corporations iv tn;s S:ate doir.g busi
ness for profit, a graduated income tax, so ad
justed that they be required to pay onij such
sums as are strictly just and fair, and that
equal justice be done among them.
â¢â¢I; the appropriations for purposes other
than the regular running expenses oi the
Government, as estimated by me Controller,
be kept within reasonable bounds, the cundi
tii ri oi tne treasury is such that, for the ntxt
two fl-ial years, oa the present valuation of
rty, t tie ttx rate will be less than 33
Cent^ per .*1OO; mid if the graduated corpora
tion i and tiie excise-license tax
0,00 themâ for state pur
â the peop.e of the State will be com-
I â  i pay le-s than 26 cents on the $100
ol property. And the Legislature
!:;plishe3 this good end will stand
as the greatest our State has ever had.
'i would recommend that this system be
inaugurated by imposing but a lim
ited tax until its practical workings be deter
mined. In this event, should inequality or
oppression to legitimate corporate interests
result, little injury would follow iis trial."
Inheritance Tax.
He urged such legislation as would relieve
:ax on collateral inheritance-, whicn, he
paid, la working a great hardship on char
liabh tal, e.eemosyaary, religious
and like institutions.
Licenses.
"There pre at the present time in this State |
; over 11,000 places licensed for the sa.e of |
spirituous liquors to be drunk upon the pren> I
" â¢ ises, and 10 collect from these a license which I
â¢ will reeulaie them and at the same time com
pensate the Stnte for the privileges they enj >y,
, r and for bearing the burdens whl-jli result
frini their existence, is a question which
should enlist the energies aud demand the
best intelligence of the law-making rx>wer.
'The present tnetdod of- collecting liquor
â¢ licenses is illogical and incomplete, while the
apportionment of lne very considerable fund
wnich results from such collection is always
unsatisfactory ai.d frequently unjust. At pres
ent the State, which supports most ol the
burdens which result irom this irnfTi secures
none of the revenue, while the interests en
gaÂ«ed in the liquor business are frequently
harassed, the vanoas interests in the local
jurisdiction never satisfied, ana the tem
porary compromise, alike unsatisfactory to
all parties, has but a short and unstable
existence. To put an end to this per- I
I peiual civil strife, and to secure to the State a
"revenue commensurate with her burd
would be well to adopt a State excise license I
.tax, equal throughout the State, and in such
amount as would insure an eflicient regulation I
of thia trufiic. raise a revenue of such magni- j
tude as would materially contribnte to the I
support of tne State Government, and secure \
to tne citizens adequate compensation for the
burdens aiising irom its existence.' 'While
such a tax might result in an increase of the
license now levied apon the liuiior business,
tiic 'act that it would permanently fix the
impost and relieve the dea;er from f-he vexa
tion <>f i rpei ual changes, wouid be tc him an
adequate return. The remaining taxpayer,
relieved by w.e settlement of the license que.s
tion in bis local jurisdiction, would befur
nished wiih a:i auduional comperi>ati>n in
the increased revenue, and in iv more just
andequitabledistribution. * * * I a. so call
your httefttion to the fact that at least one
third ot the sa'oons of this State apparentij
escape the payment of any county or mu
nicipal tax.
â¢â¢If tne Legislature fix a rate upon these
saloons that will raise the sum of only
â  51.000,000 annually for State purposes, it wn'l
reduce the amount usessed utron other prop
erty nearly twenty per cent, and make the
taxes upon the farmer and the merchant cor
adUigly low. A tax Â«veraging $100 -per
annum. as>uminj? that there arc 12 BUO
oons in the State, of which 10.000 wou'd
pay the license, would raise this amount of
revenue.
Insurance.
"Foreign insurance companies doin? busl
ness ners should be compelled to provide
propersecurity lor poiicy-hoiders. * â¦ â¢ All .
nuailv more than i? 4,000,000 is paid to forcigu
fir.- and marine' insurance companies alone.
For jh:s immense amount drawn from our
people little is. paid toward the support of our
State government. One foreign company
makinÂ« a ycariy net profit in this State oi over
(120,000, can do business in California for the
insignificant tax oJ _i) p-.r Hiiiiuin. * * â  All
secret, mid fraternal associations doing* an
Â£ insurance business should be, to this extent
under tiie jurisdiction oi the Commissioner.
tanks and Bank Commissioners,
"I recommend that every bank, be required
to make a report 10 the I;nnk Commissioners
ot its affairs, as of noon on the fir>t Monday in
Miii> of ,-acli year, the statement to be veri
fiel by the commissioners and immediately
transmitted to the Governor. Such reports
RhouKJ b- open to inspection by the Assessor
ot each county of the feUte." The Governor
ststÂ»-s tnat the just assessment of banks and
banking property is very difficult under
present laws, and that this had led to much
undeserved censure of public officials.
University of California.
"The growth of our university has been phe
nomenal. The increase in the ncrtde â¢' V^'.*
partmentat Berk-ley from the yearlÃ9O-Jl
to ihe year 1895-90, was from 457 students to
1336 students, or an increase ol nearly two to
one. Tne increase In iha affiliated colleges,
located in Ban Frftncisco. during the same pe
riod has boen Irom 311 students to ,1.,0r
more .han.loo per fÂ»t the total lnrrej.se
boms from 771 in 1890-91 to 2047 in 1835-90.
The university has ii'>t now accommodations
for these students, and the question of how to
provide for them from U:e muds that may be
used for such purpose has brconie a serious
one The university must have aid, or it will
be compelled to apportion the stuiienis here
after throu-nout the Scate in accordance with
population, and tnus deprive many o its
â¢piendid privileges. â¢ â¦ â¢ The College of
yTgricuuure is doing a most valuable work.
Railroad Commission.
The Governor recommends constitutional
changes in appointment to and operation of
the railroad cÂ« mmission, saying that "in four
tee"iÂ» years' experience in tnis State we have
not covered ourselves with glory through the
operation of the iaw as v stands. Almost any
kir.d of a change would be an improvement.
We lutisi select men who understand the law,
men experienced in rai:road milters and meu
experienced iv business."
State Prisons and Home Industries.
"Our people purchase too freely the products
of other States and countries, thU3 spending
for articles manufactured abroad immense
sums which should be used in the purchase of
product* of our own farms and factories. Dur
ing the past two years It has been my en
deavor, when possible, to confine the pur
chase, by State institutions, to the products of
California, thus changing the practice hereto
tore too frequently prevailing. The efforts oi
the Manufacturers and Producers' Association
of San Francisco, and similar associations
throughout the State, have caused an in
created demand everywhere for State products,
and the old and improper subterluge of mark
ing our goods with foreign names, to insure
their sale, is being abandoned. Of this no
better eviience has been given than in the
latest exhibition o: the Mechanics' Institute
of San Francisco, which was confined almost
entirely to State products. ,
''The competition of Eastern prison-made
articies with the products of our own free
labor is a most grievous wrong. These prod
ucts are sold in Caliiornia without brand or
mark to distinguish them. Wnile prisoners
should be compelled to labor, so as to be self
supporting, thus relieving the taxpayers from
the burdeu of their support, beyond this point
they should not be permitted to engage in re
munerative work, and their efforts snouid te
so directed p.s to produce the least iriction
with free labor. â¢ .*,â¢ That there may be no
question as to what goods are and what are
not prison-made we ought by law to require
all such to be plainly marked or stamped.
The number or quantity of foreign-made goods
sold here is immense."
Tne Governor recommends the selling of the
j State prison site ami the consolidation of that
prison with that at Folsom, where the Slate
has cneap water-power.
Asylums.
The message recommends a correction of
lax laws governing asylums. The Governor
States the: there arc many persons in the State
insane asylums wno are not dangerously in
sane and "are not therefore, under the law, le
gally entitled to a home there at all. Many
ure harmless dements.- if the law had been
complied with two asylums only, instead of
three, would have been required.
The Governor pointedly says: "This is what
we ueed â 'tne courts become very care
ful'âfor in the Home for Feeble-minded at
Ulen Ellen over one-half of the inmates should
never have been committed."
"Thousands in Caliiornia have no greater
menial capacity than hundreds of theso-cnlUd
inmates in our asylums, and it the State must
maintain the clcs's referr.d to, it will be com
pelled to tax our people for the establishment
of more insane asylums. * * * Tnere is,
however, no reason in a State tax for a clas3
which the law denies admission to or reten
tion in our ins:itu.ious. lusane asylums
should hold tne insane and the insane only,
and neither economy nor a just regard lor the
I good name ol our State will tolerate the re:en-
I tion in tluse institutions of the other depend
ents there. If the spate must maintain them,
it is belter to do so in an institution not
called at; insane osylum, but a 'home for the
dependent poor,' where they coula by their
work produce supplies for other State insti;u
tions and in part, maintain themselves.
"As the increÂ«se of the insane in the past
, has been but 150 yearly in California, if we
j discharge those not rightfully there we can
provide for all the probable insane for years
to come in these three institutions." He
reiommends the adopiio-i of the New York in
sane asylum law- of 1895. Over $200,000 per
annum could bo saved in asvium- alone by a
s'eutriii Board controlling supplies and sal
aries. He states that contrary to law Judges
commit to the Gen Eilen Home chronic
idiots and other 3 incapable of being educated,
when the law expressly forbids tbe admis
sion of such patients. Hence a large propor
tion of the inmates are of that class which it
is neither the right nor the duty of the . State
jto provide lor. "A law should be passed
making it a serious offense to either commit
to, or receive or maintain at, any State insti
tution persons not entitled under the law to i
be committed to it. * * * Tne buildings at
Glen Ellen are in many respects totally un
suited for the purposes for which they are now
used."
THE DEAF AND DUMB A>* BLIND.
! The message ca.ls attention to the fact that
this institution is not required to advertise
for bids for supplies, as is done by The other
iusti;utions of the State. 'â¢Students of our
; State I niversity, our normal schools and even
our common schobis support themselves or
j are supported by 'neir parents. It has never
been h>ld to be the duty of the State to sup-
I port them. At the institution ior the deaf
and dumb and blind, however, we find that
the inmates arc lodged and boarded at the
soie expense of the State, end in a manner
which few private Institutions of the land can
afford. The cost per capita is Â£278 per annum,
which, does not Include the uroduce of the
ianu or dairy, or the contingent fund itself,
as lam informed. In the case of this institu
tion I believe it is the duly of the State to pro
vide amply â nay. liberally â for its inmates,
and I would not stint the appropriation In
properly proviaing for them or for other
Sate wards. But I do not believe that we
i thould tax the people of this State to pay the
i living expenses of children oi well-to-do par
j ents, who ought to be happy In having them
educated in a State institution conducted so
ably and efficiently as this one."
State Prlntinsr Office.
"The expenses of the State Printing Offire
| ore excessive, due largely to the system under
whicn it is conducted." He suggests changes
in the lew in the interest of economy. The
office could not, however, under present laws,
be conducted as economically as private con
cerns.
Harbor Commission,
"The Improvement of the harbor front of
San Francisco during the past two years has
been considerable, and is receiving the com
mendation of alldisin'erested persons familiar
with its condition. The dirty, unhealthy and
dangerous condition of the water iront two
years ago, the suggestive advertisements
posted everywhere, and a loose method oi
business have given way to a cleanly aud safe
front. unequa."eJ for it* healtny and orderly
appearance by any harbor in the world. If
States are judged by the first impressious of
tourists and li-imiernnis, the judgment that
will be passed on Ca.ifornia by reason of these
changes will be inucli more favorable. To-day
the water front isa* easily and safely traversed
as the most fashionable portions of the City.
The system tf buy me supplies and doing work
h;;s greatly improved within the past year and
a half. Its number of employes is, however,
much too great.
"The Board of Stnte Harbor Commissioners
shouid consist of rive members, meeting bi
monthly, the incumbents to hold until the
expiration of their 'erms. During their term
of service they should engage in no business
other than that of the Suite. Two members of
the board should be business men. Another
should De an engineer, and tx-offido a mem
ber without extra pay, oi tee Bureau of High
ways, or of sucn other commission or board of
this State as requires his services; and should
be at the service of such other departments of
the State for such engineering work as would
not interfere with hi* duties. The fourth
member should be a praciical builder, and
ex-^fficio without extra pay, bo compelled to
supervise the construction of State buildings,
or be detailed for other duties. The fifth mem
ber shouid be the Governor. The service that
might be rendered by the engineer, ex-officio
as a member of other boards, or as a consult
ing engineer to ttio oiher institutions of the
State, wouid save many times his salary annu
ally, and the work of tne practical bui.der iv
advising the Governor, Secretary of State and
t-tate Treasurer on the adaptability of plans
and specifications under the &ct of 1870, and
In superintending building* on detail by the
State Board of Examiner*, or the board pro
vided for in the act cf 187G, would also save
many times his salary. There hai teen ereat
ioÂ«s in the construction of bin. dings for the
State by reason of faulty, work, improper
materials and other causes during the past,
and the amount paid for superintendence
during recent years has been enormous.
'â¢The direction and managem nt of the en-
Cinctring portiou of the water front should
be confided soleiy to h competent engineer,
hoidiug office, as do the United Stotes Govern

This board expends annually $000,000, which

Labor Commission.
"During the last session of the Legislature
an endeavor was made to pass a bill providing
for the establishment of free labor employnvat
agencies. Owing, however, to prejudice
against the labur bureau as then conducted
the Legisla-.ure refused to pass the bill, or even
appropriate money for the support of the bu
reau itself. I therefore appointed a gentleman
fully committed to the idea of establishing
such a bureau, and shortly after his i:igralln
tion in office he organized the same. His work
is familiar to us. Entering office under the
most inauspicious circumstances, with a
strong prejudice against the bureau iUelf, Mr.
Fltlgerald an> so organized and conducted his
department as to do gren t good ; not the least
oi lr.s work being to find positions and secure
employment, during the recent depression, for
upward of 8000 skilled and unskilled persons.
Boards cf Health.
"The powers of the State Board of Health
should be enlarged. Its wort during tiie past
year has been satisfactory ; it hns been ham
pered, however, through a tailure to pessess
e.-sential authority. Its qtiaramine rights,
under the act of March 1!), 1889, are too lim
ited, as tee experience el the past year -tins
taught us. In some official should be lodged
the power to quarantine one portion of the
State against another lor animals, as well us
human beings. The law imposes this duty for
such quarantine from points "without the
State, but leaves the board powerless within
it. Much trouble and loss were occasioned
our cattlemen during the year 1896 by renson
ol thi-i oversight In the act, una but for the
consideration of the Department of Agricul
ture at Washington Â»nd the energy of our Sen
ators and Representatives the damage to our
cattle-raisers would have b'en excessive. An
amendment to the law, providing that the
board may quarantine between various points
within the State, and allowing the use oi the
existing contiigious disease fuud ior this pur
pose, wnen necessary, would prove of incal
culable benefit to the State, and especially to
the cntile-breeders and farmers." The Gover
nor pays the Sau Francisco Board of Health a
high tribute.
Yosemlte Commission.
The Yosemi'e Commission durine the past
two years has entirely changed its system ot
doing business, and by a radical change vi its
rules and by-laws, endeavored to prevent all
poolings, special privileges or favoritisms such
as have been complained of in the past. Its
aim has been to give to trie general public,
and especially to the citizens of this State, a
place of pleasant resort at tne least possible
cost.
Roads.
Over $1 ,700.000 of money being atinuallv
expended on roads, with but little permanent

Horticultural Board.
"Since the last session of the Legislature the
expenses of the State Board of Horticulture

and developing markets beyond our State and

District Agricultural Societies.
The Governor adheres to his previous objec

lieving thnt thn entire system of agricultural
fairs should be reorganized.
Constitutional Amendments.
"Legislative terms of sixty days are too short
under a constitution which requires that each
biil shall be read in lull in each Bouse, on
three several days. The canvass for Senator,
the organization of the two Houses and of the
committees, the preparation aud Introduction
of bills ana their consideration in committee,
together with numerous other incidental mat
ters too frequently leave an insufficient time
lor work in the consideration of measures to
be acted upon. For these reasons we find
many loosely drawn bills becoming laws and
great lack 01 harmony and frequent contradic
tion in the laws themselves. It is not therefore
to be wondered at that the dominant party
should meet in caucus for the purpose of pre
venting these abuses and for other purposes.
"My predecessors made many wise sugges
tions never enacted into laws; in tact, the
message of a Governor cannot be properly con
sidered in the hurry and bustle of a legislative
session. When the Legislature really begins
to understand men, measures and State re
ports it too frequently must adjourn. Much,
time is wasted on bills that can never pass.
The Governor's Inauguration so shortly after
election, coupled with his familiarizing him
self with the policy and recommendations of
his predecessor, as given in his irst message,
after the Legislature has convened, is ex
tremely unwise.
"Our constitution should be amended, fixing
the legislative term at not to exceedlOO days,
and prohibiting the introduction ot bills in
either body after the first thirty days of the
session, except in urgency, and then only by
unanimous consent after three days none*.-.'
He thinks it unwise to inaugurate a Gov
ernor so Â»oon after election, suggesting the
first Monday in July succeeding his election.
Uis predecessor's recommendations would
then receive the consideration due them. Ho
recommends that the Governor be given thirty
days after the expiration of tbe legislative
session to consider bills, as ten days is too
short.
National Guard.
"I await the pleasure of the Legislature as
to any further or other reorganization it may
deem necessary. In your various bodies are
men long and favorably connected with the
guard itself, and so conversant with its needs
that their advice should possess the greatest
weight. In my opinion the San Francisco
regiment should be organized for heavy
artillery, ana be compelled to drill

obtained from the National Government.
Your request would, in my judgment,
secure this privilege. It should also continue
infantry work.

declaring it to be insolvent and asking

All persons who are iuterested in realiz

Appellate Court had affirmed tlie decision
of the Circuit Court, which held, in a case
where the union s-ou^ht to foreclose a

shareholder who is also a borrower does
not pay off his loan by paying his regular
installments as a member. Mortgages
similar to the one given in the case de

The Supreme Court has ruled likewise
in another case, and the effect of this de

look out for DaviS Kerrigan, wanted on a
charge of assaulting Carrio Peliington,
ten years of age, daughter oi Paul Pel
iington, living in Waunake, a mountain
settlement fifteen miles northwest of
Pater^on.
The story of the affair soon spread
through the neighborhood and aearchinc
parties were organized. Four dogs were
procured and set in searching for the trail
in the mountain heaths. Kerrigan was
traced to three places, but in each instance
he had left just before the arrival of the
searchers.
The searching party stayed out until 1
o'clock Sunday morning, when most of
them returned, having tracked Kerrigan
into the mountains at Rockaway. Morris
County.
A fresh party was sent to that place to
guard all the roads. All the men are
neavily firmed and one member of the
party took along a rope. The constables
of the place are nlso on the lookout for
the fugitive and they will try to get him

McKINLEY TO MEET ALLISON.
It Is Said the President- Elect Would Like
to Have the Senator in His
Cab net
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Jan. s.â Major Mc-
Kinley leaves on the Baltimore and Ohio
nt 8:10 p'clock Wednesday morning for
Canton to meet Senator W. B. Allison of
lowa, who will stoo for a few hours in
Canton on his way to Washington to see
the President-elect. The interview be
tween the senior Senator of lowa â who
has twice decided to remain in the Senate
when an important Cabinet position wa3
offered himâ and the President-elect, who
is avowedly seeking the strongest men he
can find for nis official family, will be the
most important political event which has
occurred at McKinley's home since the
election. It is understood that Major
McKinley would very much like to have
Senator Allison in his Cabinet, but it is
not known that an actual tender of the
portfolio has been made. Probably the
meeting to-morrow will determine
whether such a tender is to be made at all.
Major MuKinley will return to Cleve
land Wednesday night and remain here
until early next week. There will be a
number of politicians next week to see
Major McKinley, and the number of peo
ple who called to see him to-day was so
great that he has surrendered the notion
that he could secure a period of rest here.
Among Mr. McKinley's visitors to-day
was Mr. Thurston of Nebraska, who dis
cusÃed some of the Senatorial contests.
Senator Thurston and General William
Osborne, secretary of the Republican .Na
tional Committee, left for Washington
this evening.
The work of Cabinet-making has begun
in real earnest and will proceed at a lively
rate until about the 4th of March. It is
not expected that the Cabinet will be
finally completed until Major McKinley
reaches Washington.
Senor F. G. Peirra, a representative of
the Cuban Junta in New York, called on
Major McKinley and explained at some
leng h the wishes and claims of the insur
gents and their friends.
General William Osborne has invited
Major McKinley to make a visit to Bos
ton, but the present intention of the
President-elect is to remain in Canton

ARMOR PLATE
INVESTIGATION
May Lead to the Govern
ment Providing Its
Own Plant.
Big Profits Are Made by Came*
gie and the Bethlehem
Company.
Exhaustive Inquiry by the Secretary
of the Navy Through Engloni
and Francs.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. s.â The
Secretary of the Navy to-day sent in his
report to Congress on the subject of armor
plate. Under the act making appropria
tions for the naval service for the year
ending June 30, 1897, Congress directed
the Secretary to examine into the actual
cost of armor plate and the price of the
same, which should be equitably paid.
The report of the Secretary sets forth at
great length the methods and results of
his investigation, which was conducted by
himsell personally, with Captain W. C.
Samson, Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance,
and Chief Constructor Philip Hichborn as
advisers. #
Immediately after the passage of the act
the Secretary called on the two contract
ing companies, the Betblehom Iron Com
pany of South Bethlehem, Pa., and the
Carnegie S eel Company (L mited) of
Pittsburg, Pa., requesting thut they aid
him with the information necessary to
enable him to perform the duties imposed
upon him by Congress.
The two companies declined to give
information, upon the j-round that it was
very unusual for Congress to inquire into
tde business of private corporations.
They, however, in October, made state
ments as to the cost of their plants, and
furnisued suggestions to the Secretary as
to the methods which should be adopted
by him in estimating the cost of armor,
and of their investments in the armor
plates.
The Secretary called together a board
composed of Lieutenants Karl Roarer,
Kossuth Niles and A. A. Ackerman, two
ot whom had been inspectors of armor at
tue Bethlehem Company's Iron Works.
The other, Lieutenant Ackerman, had
been connected with tiie manufacture and
use of steel in its different forms for a
number of years, and had been on duty
in the Bureau of Ordnance. These gentle
men made an exhaustive report upon the
cost of labor and material entering into
the cost of a ton of armor. The result of
their calculations was that the cost of
labor and material in a ton of single
lorged Harveyizeu nickel steel armor is
$167 30.
L'.eutenant-Commander Rodgers, who
h.id been inspectoral thn Bethleiieni Iron
Works, estimated the cost and labor and
material in a ton of single-forged Harvev
ized nickel-steel armor at $178 59. The
inspector of ordnance at the Carnegie
Steel Company, Ensign C. B. McVay, who
was also called upon for an estimate, re
ported that the labor and .material in a
ton of single-gorged Harveyized nickei
steel armor is $161 51.
Adding 10 per cent to each of these
estimates tor loss due to rejections makes
the estimate of the board $184 GO; the esti
mate of Lieutenant-Commander Rodgers,
$196 46. and of Ensign McVay, $177 69.
For reformed nickei-steei Harveyized
armor the estimate of Lieutenant-Com
mander Rodgers is $208 85 and of Ensign
McVay $190 09.
The Secretary in making his calcula
tions says that in order to be just to both
the manufacturers and the Government
he took an average estimate, which is
$164 38 for single forged and $197 73 for re
forged armor, in maKing the calculations
contained in the report.
Shortly alter the passage of the act
letters were written to the naval attache
at London and the naval attache at Paris,
instructing them to secure additional in
formation as to the prices paid for armor
to European manufacturers and as to the
cost of establishing armor plants like
those possessed by the two American
companies.
The question of the cost of establishing
an armor plant being a material one, the
Secretary personally visited Europe dur
ing the past summer for the purpose of
prosecuting inquiries in this direction and
als to make further inquiries as to the
prices ot armor.
While abroad he visited a number of
armo?-plants and machine-shops and se
cured two estimates, one made in France
and the otber in England, of tlie cost of
erecting armor-plants. The French esti
mate was for the erection of an armor
plant at Guerigny, and was made by the
French Government for the purpose of
ascertaining the cost to erect an armor
piant in connection with the works of the
Government already at that place. This
pstimate made by the Government of
France for the erection in connection with
its plant, now makinsr protective decks
and equipment supplies, is $700,000 all
told. The Secretary estimates that, allow
ing for duties and for higher-priced labor
in the buiiding or houses and installing of
the plant, an efficient armor-plant based
on the French figures could be erected in
this country for $1,400,000.
The. English estimate, made by a com
pany of experience and reputation^ and
which is prepared to furnish the piant,
puts the construction at $567,000. This es
timate was referred to the chief of the
Bureau of Ordnance, to be completed by
adding the estimated cost of duties, build
ings, installments and other items deemed
necessary to make it equal the American
plants. As this completed the estimate
for putting up a plant equal to that of the
Carnegie Company, said to have cost
$3,000 000, it could not be erected for
$1,590,000.
The Secretary sets forth at some length
the fact that the Bethlehem Company, be
ing the first to erect an armor plant in this
country, necessarily made a number of
costly experiments, cliief among which
was the erection of a hammer, said to
have cost between $400,000 and $700,000.
He therefore has allowed the Bethle
hem Company in his calculations $1,000,000
more as the cost of their plant than is
allowed the Carnecie Company. He esti
mates on the basis of the English plant,
with additions by Captain Sampson of
$1,590 000 and allowing for the difference
in prices between the present time and
1890, when the Carnegie Company's plant
was erected, his estimate would be that
the Carnegie Company should be allowed
$2,500,000 for its plant. As the plant of
the Bethlehem Company, owing to its
costly experiments, cost considerably
more, he makes an additional allowance
to them of $1,000,000, and his estimate
would be that its plant cost $3,500,000, but
he takes the statement of the companies
as showing what the pants cost.
The Secretary, upon his return from
Europe, sent an officer to Harrisburg, Pa.,
who secured copies of the returns from the
Bethlehem Company showing its capital
authorized, capital paid in and dividends
from 1889 to November 1, 189 G. inclusive.
. This information was supplemented,
after request by the Secretary, by the
Bethlehem Inn Company * and by
Additional information secured from the
Bank of Pennsylvania, so that the Secre
tary had at hand the statements of the
Bethlehem Company as to their gross
receipts, net receipts, dividends paid and
surnlus from 1889 to 189Â« inclusive. TÂ«his
information was all from the company
itself, and therefore important. From it
the Secretary prepared a statement show
ing that whatever may have been the co-t
of the armor plant and the gun plant,
whatever may have been paid for the
secrets of manufacture or for patents, or
whatever may have been the interest on
the working capital, all those and other
charges have been paid from the gross
earnings of the company, and the results
show the company's investment in the
plant to make armor and gun steel for the
Government have been returned with 22
percent thereon.
The Secretary, in another form, states
the account of the Bethlehem Company
with the Government as a profit aud loss
account, based on tlie reports to the Audi
tor-Generai of Pennsylvania, which are
from the company's statements from No
vember 1, 1889, to November 1, 1896, show
ing a balance of profit, 1889 to 1896 in
clusive, of $672,728. Tlie reports made by
the Carnegie Company, however were so
indefinite as to be practically of no value,
and it was necessary for the Secretary to
resort to the best evidence obtainable for
the purpose oi showing: First, the value
of its plant; second, tlie price of labor
and material entering into a ton of armor;
third, the amount that should be allowed
the company for maintenance, and the
amount of the plant upon which main
tenance should be allowed; and the ac
count of the Carnegie Company with the
Government is stated in several ways, one
table allowing a valuation of $3,000,000 for
the plant, another at $2,500,000, and a
third of $2,000,000.
On a $3,000,000 valuation of the plant,
allowing 5 per cent for maintenance, the
rate claimed by the company, and 5 per
cent on a working capital of $750,000, and
allowing a dividend to the company of 10
per cent per annum on outstanding capi
tal, the Secretary shows that the entire
cost of the plant is practically extin
guished upon the completion of existing
contracts.
Assuming the cost of the plant to be
$2,000,000, and allowing 10 per cent thereon
lor maintenance, insurance, etc., and 5
per cent on working capital, and auowins
10>^ per cent dividend on outstanding cap
ital invested in the plant, applying tho
surplus of the net earnings, after deduct
ing dividends for each period of six
months to the extinguishment of the cost
of the plant, the Secretary shows that the
Carnegie Company will have been on the
Ist day of July, 1897, repaid every dollar
it claims to have expended on its plant,
and, after the allowance noted above, will
have made a profit on its investment up
to the time when that investment was ex
tinguished by the repayment of the
money of 15 per cent.
The statute under which the report of the
Secretary is made requires a report noi
only as to what is the actual cost of manu
facturing armor, but also what sum ought
equitably to be paid for armor herealter.
In dealing with this question the Secre
tary sets forth fully the great risk involved
by ttiese companies when tneir plants were
erected, of having work for only a short
time, and that for many reasons their
profits were necessarily expected to be
lar r e. He also shows that the Govern
ment, having really created these plants,
ougnt to perpetuate them, as such indus
tries are necessary in order to enab.e this
country to be independent in the impor
tant matter of public defense. He is of
the opinion that the Government should
pay for armor in the future a price suffi
ciently liberal to justify the contractors
in ke ping their plants in order and ready
at all times to manufacture armor wheu
ocrasion requires.
He concludes that in view of all the cir
cumstances regarding the uncertainty of
future contracts it would not be inequita
ble to allow the contractors 50 per cent
profit upon the cost of manufacturing
armor for the three ships now under con
tract. Adding 50 per cent to $250 per ton
of armor gives $375. But the Secretary
recommends that, as the nickel is now
furnished by the Government, which
makes an addition of $20 per ton in the
price of armor, it woulid be Defter in the
future to have the contractors iumlsh this
material, wbicli would brinz tde price ud
to $395 per ton ; and allowing something
for keepins nickel on hand, he suggests
that $400 per tou would be a fair and
equitable price to pay for the armor for
the Wisconsin, Alabama and Illinois.
Ending his rei-ort, the Secretary recom
mends that if Congress shall determine
upon any limit of price to be paid it shall
also give the S -cretary o: the Navy power
to erect or buy an armor plant and a gun
plant, ami, if need be, to lease such plant
or plants until it can construct one of its
own.

Governments and foreign States by the
Government of the United States from

of Secretary Olney's contention that the
recognition of foreign Governments should
be exclusively an executive function in
which Congress had no part. The pre

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 5. â The
seventh day's session of the Ways and
Means Committee found the rooms well
filled with those interested in the agricul
tural schedule, including live animals,
dairy products, fruits, fish, meats, etc.
W. H. Kockwell of Warren, Pa., en
gnged in raising, feeding and fattening
cattle iv Kansas and Mexico, was the rir<t
speaker. He said that under the McKin
ley law cattle could not be imported from
Mexico, as the tariff was prohibitive. He
had started business in Arizona in 1893,
but on account of the dry season was
forced to go to Mexico. Tne Kansas
farmer, he said, was greatly benefited by
the bringing of cattle from Mexico to
Kansas, where they were kept from six to
eighteen months. Last year the cattle
men paid $22,000 to the Kansas farmers
for grain alone,- and this year the amount
wouid be over $40,000. Much was also
paid the farmers for their labor, and ie
was more profitable to t^e farmer than
raising cattle themselves.
M. L. Sherman of Salina, Kan?., also
engaged in the cattle business, said that
mo trade was almost entirely in the hands
of American sand that two-thirds of the
cattle coming froiii Mexico were owned by
Americans.
Representative Curtis of Kansas asked
for a duty of $10 per head on cattle for one
year. The Krnsas raisers and ferders, he
said, were injured and not benefited by
the importation of Mexican catlle. It
prevented them from raising stock them
selves. .
Representative Bowers of California
then took up the matter on which he ap
peared â the fruit trade. It was, he said,
in the interest of all, the raiser and pro
ducer, to raise the present rates on fruit.
The law now affords no protection to the
growers and does not yield any revenue to
speak of.
It was suggested by a member of the
commitieft that an increase in duty would
raise the price. Mr. Bowers replied that
it would not. On tne contrary, the fruit
growers of his State would guarantee to
increase production and decrease prices.
On raisins, prunes, plums and all dried
fruits he asked a duty of 3 cents per pound.
This would in-are Americans a market
and stimulate the industry. On oranges
he requested a duty of 25 cents per cubic
foot. It the fruit-crowers were given fair
protection some $16,000,000, which was
yearly sent abroad for fruit, would be kept
at home.
Senator Perkins of California presented
the memorial of the fruit-growers of Cali
fornia requiring the dudes mentioned by
Mr. Bowers. He aho indorsed what bis
colleague had said.
T. B. Armstrong of California, who was
speaking tor the almond-growers, said
that they had almost been ruined by the
present law. He asked for an increase in
the duty from 3 to 6 cents per pound, with
10 cents on shell -d almonds. Some $10,
--000.000 or $10,0v0,000, he said, was invested.
Davis Lubin of California requested an
export duty on all agricultural products.
A. J. Wedderburn, representing the
State Grange of Virginia, appealed for an
export bounty on agricultural products.
E. N. Ljomis, representing the produce
merchants of New York City, asked for a
low duty on early vegetables, especially
potatoes and onion?. Replying to a ques
tion, he said that the admission of these
produc;s would not damage the trade of
Calilornia or the Southern States.
Representative Russell of Connecticut
presented the petition of the seed farmers
of southern New England, advocating a
specific diity according to the following
schedule:
Five cents per pound on all turnip, rape,
spinach, parsley, beet and mangold; 15 cents
per pound on celery, lettuce, endive; iiO cents
per pound on cabbage, kale, onion, salsify,
tomato; 20 cents per bushel on peas and
beans; 40 cenis per pound on kohlrabi; 50
cents per pound on cauliflower; all seeds not
enumerated, GO per ceit ad valorem.
A committee, composed of Burnet
Landreth, W. F. Greer and W. A. Burpee,
all of'Philadelpbia, appeared in behalf of
tbe seed farmers, seed importers and
laborers. Mr. Landreth urged a specific
duty levied on the bushel or pound and
an increase in the rate? on garden seeds.
He suggested the following schedule:
Five cents per pound od ell seed of table
beets, suijar beets, kale, leek, lettuce, mangel

include mushroom spawn, aromatic seeds, pot
herbs, medicinal seeds, castor beans, cotton,
canary, clover, hemp, tree, tobacco, mustard,
flax, poppy, sorghum and grass, and oil seeds
and vetcnes.
Representative D. F. Wilber of New
York presented the petition of the Na
tional Hay Association requesting a duty
of $4 per ton on hay. He also spoke for
the hop faxmers of New York, who, he
said, since the Gorman-Wilson bill be
came a law, which reduced the duty on
hops from 15 cents to 8 cents per pound,
had been forced to sell their product for
less than the cost of production.
At the request of Representative Sher
nam of New York the testimony relating
to hops taken when the McKiniey bill wan
in preparation was ordered printed as a
part of to-day's proceedings.
T. J. Baker of Charleston, S. C, and F.
G. Ernst of New Or.cans, on behalf of the
rice-growers, asked for a protective duty
on this product.
A. J. Toomey of New York asked for a
auty of 2 cents per pound on macaroni,
to make up in part the difference in labor
between the United States and abroad.
F. Woodruff of Brooklyn opposed any
change in the salt scheaule of the present
law.
E. W. Brown of New York, representing
the salt manufacturers of the United
States, suggested the re-enactment of the
McKiniey law provisions regardine salt.
W. A. Hadley of Boston helii that a

esÂ«ary.
R. R. Backer spoke for the Michigan

fourth of a cent on cod and a new clause
giving I}% cents on skinned and boneless

ANOTHER POLISH CHURCH RIOT.
Bullets, Bricks and Clubs Fly in Every
Direction and Many Persons Are
Seriously Irjured.
BAY CITY, Mich.. Jan. 5. â The St.
Stanislaus Polisn Church troubles, which
h.ive been agitating tlie communicants of
that parish for more than a year, broke
out afresh to-day, and a riot ensued in
which one man was shot and severely in
jured and several others were badly hurt
by being beaten with clubs
Ti;e injured are: Joseph JBartkowik,
shot in the neck and breas>t; James Staz
hinski, beaten into insensibility with
clubs; Alexander Yonkowjak, severely
beaten with clubs; Police Officer Fitzger
ald, beaten with clubs.
The irouble started yesterday when
Father Bogacki, the priest of St. Stanis
laus parish, refused to celebrate mass over
the remains of a member of St. Michael's
Society. He also refused to give up the
banner of the society, which was in the
church, and a riot was only averted at
that time by the priest delivering the ban
ner to the infuriated Poles.
The warring faction held a meeting last
night and decided to reopen the war.
Shortiy after 10 o'clock this morning a
mob began to gather about the church and
parsonage. They demanded that Father
Bogacki and his bodyeuard leave the
building, which the priest refused to do.
Then the mob attacked the parsonage.
The handful of police which had been sta
tioned about the house were powerless to
stop the onslaught of the rioters. A fusil
lade Of stones, bricks, clubs and every
handy missile was directed against the
house. An attempt was made to break in
the front dcor, when Officer Fitzgerald,
who waa on duty inside the house, it is
claimed, fired at the leader, Joseph Bart
kowik, two bullets striking(him â one in
the neck and the other in the breast.
In tbe meantime, James Stazhinski,
Joseph Sroki and Alexander Yonkowjak
of Father Bogacki's bodyguard tried to
escape by jumping from the windows.
SroKi managed to get away from the
crowd, but Stazhinski and YonKowjak
were nearly beaten to death before the
police could rescue them.
Father Bogacki and the rest of his body
guard took refuge in the cellar, where they
remained until 1 o'clock this afternoon,
when an agreement was reached whereby
Father Bogacki and Oflicer Fitzgerald
were promised a safe passage if they
would vacate the house. When the priest
and officer appeared, the latter became
scared and started to run. He was clubbed
several times over the head, but managed
to leave the mob behind and give himself
up to the authorities at the Central sta
tion. Bogacki was not molested, and was
driven to the fct. James parsonage. After
the priest had vacated the crowd slowly
dispersed. During tbe riot, it is said,
dozens of shots were fired. There is fear
that the police will set tire to the parson
age to-night.

3 THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALLGREAT VICTORIES
FOR THE CUBANS
A Sanguinary Battle Near
Cartagena on New
Year's Day.
Spanish Forces Under Colonel
Rosa Meet With a Crush
ing Deleat.
General Rivera, Who Succeeded
Maceo, Slaughters the Troops
Under Colone. Segura.
KEY WEST, Fla., Jan. s.â Advices
from Havana received by Cuban leaders
here are to the effect mat there was a
bloody engagement on iNew Year's day
between Spaniards and insurgents near
Cartagena, a town in the western part of
Matanzas province, near the Santa Clara
line.
Near Cartagena were encamped 1200
Spaniards under Colonel Rosa, who had
been ordered to prevent the vanguard of
Gomez from crossing the Rio Gonzalo.
On New Year's day the Spaniards were,
attacked by 1000 Cuban infantry and 500
cavalry. The Spaniards held a strong
position and had four field pieces, but the
Cubans mnde a direct charge. The insur
gents, however, were repulsed.
The Cuban commauder then ordered his
cavalry to turn the flank of the Spaniards
and attack them in the rear. This maneu
ver was executed, and as the cavalry
chirked the Spaniards from the rear the
Cuban infantry attacked in front. The
Spanish forces broke and fled, being pur
sued by the Cubans almost to Cartagena.
It is said eleven Spanish officers were
killed, including Colonel Rosa. It is also
reported that 140 Spanish privates were
killed and nearly -00 wounded. The Cu
bans are said to have lost 60 Killed and
about 90 wounded. The Cubans captured
the four field-pieces and many small arms.
Further advices report that the Span
iards under Colonel Segura have been
routed in Piuar del Rio by the Cubans
under General Rivera, who succeeded
Maceo. It is stated that Colonel Segura,
with 2000 men, attempted to carry Ri
vera's position in the Pinar del Rio hills.
Rivera threw out small parties, which
fell back, and the Spaniard* were drawn
on until caught by an enfilading fire
which threw them into confusion.
Il:rera then ordered a charge and Se
gura's broken ranks were swept down the
bill with frightful loss. Rivera pursued
the Spaniards till nightfall. It is claimed
that Segura lost nearly 300 killed and 400
wounded, while the Cuban loss was small.
When the nev;s reached Havana it was
suppressed and Spanijh officials spread
the story of Rivera's death to counteract
the effect of the story of Segura's defeat.
It is said that a steamer reached Havana
with 300 wounded men. These men were
euaraed to prevent their talking of the
disaster.
ZEUXVCHA AS A GUIV
The Traitor Undertnlee* to Pilot the
Spanish force*.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 5.â A Sun spe
cial irom Havana says: There is great
indignation here among the Cubans on
account of the news that Dr. Maximo Zer
tucha ha 3 been engaged as a guide for the
Spanish troops and will soon leave for
Pinar del Rio. There are few men who
know that province as well as Dr. Zertucha,
who was for a long time a physician in
llelina del Stir and other small towns.
As Mayor of Melina before the war he had
occasion to study the topography of the
country and all t!ie strategic points in the
mountains.
He is now living in a house on Animas
street, Havana, surrounded by a strong
guard of policemen to prevent him from
any attack from the Cubans, because they
have sentenced him to death on account
of his treachery toward General Maceo.
iiAW/.VG OF IHE ItAUSTLESS.
Grent Rrjiticlng Over 1hÂ» Filibustering
Vrsxrl'n Sii-cmt.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. s.â The Cuban
paper, El Porveuir, published in this city,
received to-day the following dispatch
from Key West signed by Emilio Nunez
referring to the Dauntless expedition :
Expedition was happily disembarked at
SagiUk, in combination v.ith Gomez.
By this it is understood that the Daunt

that the supplies were received by Gomez.
Tiie Dauntless took the iifty-one men and
the arms and ammunition which the
Three Friendsjeft on No Name Key, near
Key West, after failibjc tv land them in
tuba. The cargo is said to have con
tained 14,184 rifles, 500,000 cartridges. 600
machetes, 1000 pounds of dynamite, medi
cines, Btipplie?, etc.
Segau, where the expedition was landed,
is en important town of Santa Clara
province and is on the north coast. The
landinc was probably made on one of the
beaches west of the port, which is pro
tected by one or more Spanish gunboats.
Gomez was last reported a few miles
south o; Sagua.
Cubans here are rejoicing over the re
port of a successful landing of an expedi
tion after the failure of the Three Friends
and the sinking of the Commodore.
3JO.VEI tJSjIS WEILKR.
The Jiliatitiippi Congrenaman Enchanted
With the ZtUtud.
HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. 5 â H. D. Money,
member of the House of Representatives
from Mississippi, who arrived in Cuba a
few days ago, will return to the United
States to-morrow. Money refuses to talK
about the results of his visit.
To-day, accompanied by Consul-General
Lee, he visited Captain-General Weyler,
and was received very cordially. General
Weyler expressed regret that he was not
in the city when Mr. Money arrived. He
added that had lie been here he would
have invited him to join him in his trip
to the province of Pinardel Rio, ana he
would then have had an excellent oppor
tunity to see the country.
Mr. Money said he was enchanted with
the little he had Keen of Cuba. He alluded
to the comments that have been made on
his trip to San Jose de las Lajas, to which
Genera! Weyler replied cheerfully that he
paid no attention to what had been said.
He declared that he would be pleased if
others came to Cuba with the same pur
pose as Mr. Moneyâ that is, to admire and
study the country.
Alex Brice, Consul at Matanzas, and
Walter B. Barker, American Consular
Agent at Laguna la Grande, hare arrived
here tv pay their respects to Mr. Money.
Mr. Barker comts from the same State as
Mr. Money.
THREE f&JLtt*na XiIJBKLED.
Frobabln That (Jk<> Ve**el VTlll Be Charged
n:th J'iractj.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. 5.â A new
libel was riled against the Three Friends
in the United S:ates court to-day by Dis
trict Attorney Frank Clark. In this libel
the steamer is not charged with violating
any particular section of the Revised
Statutes, and it is possible that this
omission is for the purpose of charging
the vessel with piracy.
In the libel it is alleged that the Three
Friends was armed and tilted out in the
port oi Fernnndina on December 14, 1896,
with a lar^e amount of stores, rifles,
cartridges, machetes, dynamite, large
Hotcbkiss gun or cannon; that it was so
armed and litted out for the purpose of
conducting hostilities against the sub
jects, people and property of the King
of Spain in the island of Cuba;
that the fitting out was done by
John O'Brien with the aid of T. Lewis,
John Dunn, J. M. Barrs, H. P. Fritot and
J. A. Huaa, and that on or about Decem
ber 19 on the high seas the first three
named and others unknown mounted on
the bow of thÂ« vessel the Hotchkiss gun
for the purpose of conducting hostilities
as aforesaid.
The libel is for the forfeiture of the
vessel to the United States. An attach
ment was at once issued and served by
the Marshal and the boat is once more
tied up. The District Attorney claims
that the owners will not be permitted to
give bonds for the reiease of the vessel.
WEILEH'S J-XI'IiCTATIOXa.
Still Salt Hopes of Shortly Suppretsing
the Itnbtlllon.
MADRID, Spain, Jan. sâ The Imparcial
publishes a report of an interview had by
the correspondent of the paper in Ha
vana with Captain-General Weyler yester
day. General Weyler says he expects to
put an end to the rebellion in the Havana
district in a fortnight, and to accomplish
the pacification of the island to the Jucaro
Trocha in the Matanzas Province long be
fore the rainy s-eason sets in. Weyler is
still of the beiief that military action
ought to be allowed to have a free course
until the end of the rebellion, and he is
also convinced that no reform in the ad
ministration is now necessary.

Cardinus, a well-to-do Cuban patriot who
went to Paris four months ago to raise

NEEDS Of THE STATE.
Continued /rom Third Paat.
be accomplished, under article XVI of our
constitution, oil a vote of the peop.e and Issu
ance of bonds, 'the saving would more than
justify the expend! tore, while the conven
ience and safety assured would make the same
most desirable.
â Were the militia better equipped for actual
service, neither officers nor men would be
criticized for matiers now beyond their con
trol.
"A special military emergency fund, de
voted to the purchase of supplies, the traus
porttition, care and pay oi troops during
emergencies, is needed. The present system
is cosily to the Slate."
Mmmg 1 .
"I t is well known to all miners and mining
lawyers tnat the laws reiaiing to the location,
relocation and manner of recording lode and
piaeer claims, the necessary to hold
possession thereof, and the rieht, 01 co-owners,
ar<? very unsettled; that their rights to liens
thereon are uncertain mid most unsatisiactory.
The United States Government recognizes
miners' laws and customs where there are no
statutory provisions governing the same.
â¢ "The miners' convention, at its recent
session, appointed a committee to propose
new laws, or revise the existing ones, on these
and kindred subjects, and they will cause bills
to be prepared lor your consideration. Con
sidering the high source from which these
measures come, I lecommend their most
careful consideration, and when so drawn or
amended as to remove the uncertainty exist
ing ond to give relict to prospectors and
miners and stability and record to their
claims and proper iien3 tliereon, that they be
passed."
Rivers of the State.
"The improvement of these rivers should be
by the National Government, but when it
hesitates, nay, halts, wnen it should begin,
the State ought to a.cp m and do the work
itself. The entire State is deeply interested iv
this subject, and I recommend to your honor
able bodies that you consider this matter care
fully, devisa ways nnd Means of giving our in
terior the relief it needs nnd enact a law carry
ing a proper appropriation for that purpose."
Viticulture.
"At the last session of the Legislature the
duties of the Board of State Viticullurai Com
missioners were, upon my suggestion, trans
ferred to the university, nnd while this
chance occasioned considerable friction the
results have justified the bÂ»-st hopes of the ad
vocates of the transfer. Viticulture is one of
the most extensive and flourishing industries
of our State; it is of vnsi present commercial
importance, and promises, in the bauds of the
intelligent and progressive persoas cngng.-d
in it, to do as much to enrich our State as any
of its greatest resmrces. The scientific and
practical specialists of the university nave
taken hold of this matter with enthusiasm,
and during the short time it has been in their
hands have done most valuable work. I am
convinced that their work: is proving satisfac
tory to ail concerned in vine-growl v.g or wine
manufacturing, and the university should be
given sufficient appropriation for this purpose
to enable them to continue the work they
have so well begun."
The FuncMntr Bill.
Tne message recommends the passage of
resolutions instructing our Senators and ad
vising our Representatives in Congress to use
ail honorable means to defeat the funding
bill there now pending.

LOUD TALK ON
THE LOUD BILL
It Excludes Sample Copies
and Serial Novels From
the Mails.
Barring Them Out of the
Department as Second-
Class Matter.
Opening of Congress After the Holiday
Recessâ New Snate Cuban
Resolutions-
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. s.â Only
about half th; members of the House
were in their seats to-day when that body
was called to order alter the holiday re
cess and entered upon the bulk of the
work of the last session of the Fifty
fourth Congress.
A resolution introduced by Broderick
(R.) of Kansas was agreed to, calling upon
the Secretary of the lnteiior to report to
the House the reason why patents for
lands in Kansas granted to the old Kan
sas i'acilic Railroad Company had not
been issued to the company, and why
homestead entries upon them were being
permitted to be made by the officers of
the Topeka Land District.
By the terms of the order adopted De
cember 19 the House resolved itself into
committee of the whole to consider the
Load bill, to amend the postal laws by ex
cluding "sample copies" and serial publi
cations from second-class mail matter,
which held the floor for the rest of the day.
The passage of the bill was advocated by
Kyle (D. ) of Mississippi, Burton and
Bromwell (R.) of Ohio and Ogden (D.) of
Louisiana, and opposed by Quigg. (It.) of
New York, Johnson (R.) of California and
Cummings (D.) of New York.
Before the House proceeded to the dis
cussion of the Loud bill Brodericu of Kan
sas secured unanimous consent for the
presentation of the following resolution,
which was agreed to:
Whf.kkas, There are large and valuable
trac sof iand situate in the State of Kansas,
which were embraced in the grant made by
the Government to the Union Pacific Railway
Company to which paten s have not yet been
Issued; and whereas, most of these lands have
b.jen sold by said railway company to bona
tide purchasers, who <ire in possession, and
who have made lasting ana valuable Improve
ments tbcreon; and whereas, the United Slates
Land Office at Topeka, Kan., have
allowed ami are allowing homesteads to be
made on these lands v.ithout apparent legal
authority; ihereiore,
Jicxolved, That the Secretary of the Interior
be pnd he is hereby directed to report to the
House the cause of tne omission to issue
patents to said lands aud the authority under
which the United states Land Office at To
peka pretends to act in permitting these en
tries to be made.
BrodericK Btated that within the limits
of ihe Topeka district homestead entries

The House then went into comnittee of
the whole, Payne (R.) of New York in the
chair, for the consideration of the Loud
bilL
Quigg (R.) of New York began the
argument against the bill. He said the
author of the bill had been wofullv misled
by the statement that this class of matter
was being transmitted at a cost of 7 cents
a pound and that, therefore, this amount
would be saved. The fallacy of the con
clusion lay in the fact that the gentleman
made no allowance for fixed charges in
the postal service. The only possible sav
ing, under the bili, would be the indefinite
amount actually paid the railroad com
panies for carrying the matter.
Bromweil (R.) of Uhio said the neces
sity for the bill lay first in the state of the
Government's finances, which demanded
a reduction wherever possible, and second
and principally, the duty Congress owed
to the country to protect it from the de
moralization of trashy literature and
worse that is distributee broadcast over
the land through the mails, at a cost of 1
cent a pound. Really valuable literature
â schoolbooks, for instanceâ he said did
not circulate at 1 cent a pound; the Holy
Scriptures had no such privilege unless
they were cut up into parts and issued as
a serial, in order to defraud the revenues
of the Government; tracts and similar
publications paid 8 cents a pound, while
the Old Slouth series paid 1 cent a pound.
OÂ°den (D.) of Louisiana favored the bill.
The opposition to the bill was further
expressed in a vigorous speech by Cum
mines (D.) of New York. He said that
the claim made by the friends ot the bid
that it had the support of the newspaper
profession because of its indorsement by
the Newspaper Publishers' Association, if
well founded, might have caused him to
swallow his convictions and vote for the
bill. But the association represented but
161 out of over 1800 daily newspapers of
the country. Pvghiy-tive per cent of the
newspaper circulation in the United
States, he said, was that of papers of less
tban 1000 copies, and it was against this
class of publications that the' bill would
operate.
Mahaney (R.) of New York asked Cnra
miniis if he thought the Postoffice De
partment ouzht to be acirculating library.
â¢'I believe," Cummin^s answered vehe
mently, "that the Postoffice Department
ought to obey the law, and that the Post
master-General should not do as the Sec
retary of State and sÂ°ay to Congress, 'You
can pass a law, but we'll do as we please
about putting it into execution.' " [Ap
plause.]
At the conclusion of Cummings' re
marks the committee rose, and at 4:40
o'clock abjourned until to-morrow.

WASHINGTON, D. Q, Jan. s.â There
was no Dublic interest manifested in the
reassembling of the Senate to-day after
the holiday recess. There were, as shown
by a call of the Senate, forty-nine Senators
present â only four more than the number
necessary to constitute a quorum. The
proceedings were as unimportant as they
were uninteresting.
Peffer (Pop.) of Kansas read a speech in
favor of a joint resolntion introduced by
rum December 14 for the appointment of
a National Monetary Commission to ex
amine and study the general subject of
finances in its practical relations to the
business affairs of the people of the United
States. After the speech the joint resolu
tion was referred to the Committee on
Finance.
A memorial was presented from the
Massachusetts Historical Society for the
repair and preservation of the famous old
frigate Constitution, as a naval museum,
just as Nelson's battle-ship Victory is pre
served at Portsmouth.
A joint resolution was introduced by
Call (D.) of Florida instructing the Presi

of Julio Sanguilly, condemned to perpetual
imprisonment for bis connection with the

At 2:30 the Senate adjourned until to

Boite Penrote Bents Him in the Ra.ee
for Senator.
HARRISBURG. Pa., Jan. s.â The great
fight for Senator Cameron's seat is over.
Senator Boise Penrose of Philadelphia
has won. The joint Republican caucus
was held in the hall ol the Representa
tives, and a great crowd tilled the galle
ries and all the space in the rear of the
desks. The merits of Mr. Penrose and ex-
Postmaster-General Wanamaker were pre
sented in glowing periods by their nomin
ators and seconder.-, and then the vote
was taken. It resulted: for Penrose 133,
for Wanamaker 75, for Cameron 1, for ex-
Congressman John B. Robinson 1, and for
John Rice of the Superior Court 1.
When the chairman announced that
Penrose hail received the highest number
of votes and was the caucus nominee,
Senator Kauffruann, the Wanamaker
leader, arose and moved to make the
n omination unanimous, which was done.
Governor Chauncey P. Black of New
York was chosen as the Democratic can
didate for Senator.

Effects of the Jiig atortn in the Missis-
Mippi Valley.
ST. LOUIS Mo., Jan. s.â Every train
arriving at Union Station this evening was
late, owing to the severe storm that had
covered the whole Mississippi Valley.
The heavy rains of the past two days
have flooded all the streams, and wash
outs and delayed travel on the Iron
Mountain and the San Francisco roads.
The succeeding clear and colder weather
has, however, been of benefit. The river
at this point continues to rise, ana at 6
p. M. stood 21 feet above low water mark.
Fully 175,000 feet of lumber and a num
ber of bomhouses and small craft were
swept away. An armj r of men was busy
to-day on the river front removing barrels
and boxes to high ground. A slight fall is
reported in the Missouri River this even
ing and river men say that the crest of
the high water will not be greater than
twenty-six feet. Telegraphic reports from
the West tell of heavy storms moving east
and north.

Alliance work to Dr. Simpson, who has raised so much money and accom
plished such great good in mission work. Mr. Lelacheur is now at the head
of the missionary work in Japan, as well as China.
"He arrived here a few months ago, as will be remembered, and went
East to confer with Dr. Simpson. Dr. Simpson is the great organizer and chief
of the Alliance work.

devoted to the work.
"He will be greeted at the First Congregational Church by Dr. Georpe
S. Adams. There will be excellent music of an appropriate kind. The Salva
tion Army Chinese corps will also be present, and will probably voice a greet

for China. Several missionaries now here will also, as is now indicated, speak
on that occasion. Besides several of the local ministers will appear and

"Mrs. Lelacheur is at present with Mrs. George Montgomery at Beulah.
6he will not return to China with her husband."
Rev. Mr. Lelaclieur for the last six years lias been at the head of the Alli

possessed of a pleasing style of delivery, Mr. Lelacheur is reputed to be a very
interesting speaker.
China, the field over which he has supervision, includes, according to his
declaration, 1700 walled cities, many of them with a population equal to that

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
The Legislature starts well.
There will be economy at Sacramento
this lime.
What has Senator Perkins done to merit
a re-election?
California should have a Senator who is
able to speak for her.
The resolutions against the funding bill
will get to Washington in time to do good
service.
The voice with which California speak 3
in the great councils of the Nation should
be an eloquent voice.
All inaugural addressas make an appeal
for economy, and Mayor Pheian's was in
the height of fashion.
Republican legislators will remember it
is never advisable in politics any more
than in war to make the move the enemy
desires.
The way to advance the prestige of Cali
fornia in the Union is to put to the front
men who have in them some of the vigor
of the State.
It is a sure thing that the favorite can
didate for the Senate of the Democratic
organs is not the best candidate for the
Republican party.
The Post . u ays, "There will be a Vacancy
in the office of United States Senator from
California if Mr. Perkins is re-elected,"
and the Post is well posted.
It goes without saying the Examiner
would never support a candidate for the
United States Senate whose election would
strengthen the Republjcan party.
The Examiner may be right in saying of
Perkins, "He is no* a Mugttire, for in
stance, or a Bowers, when it comes to the
funding bill" â but what is he then?
California requires much important leg
islation from the National Government,
but she will never get it unless she sends
a man oi Jorce and ability to ths Senate.
The persistent suggestion by the Exam
inerol the possible use of a ?ack at the
State capital is doubt!es ; caused by a lively
remembrar.ee of the Senatorial election of
1837.
It must be borne in mind that one of the
Senators from California i 3 a Democratic
free-trader. Can the Republican protec
tionists of the State afford to leava their
interests in the Senate to him or to a
dummy?
According to the Examiner, many Demo
crats in the Legislature have been "out
spoken in saying they would vote for Per
kins at once in case tbe pinch came on a
contest." What is the meaning of that
sort of fusion?
No man should be sent to the United
States Senate to represent the Republicans
of California who emnloyed his energies
in the last campaign in looking after his
own personal advancement instead of the
Euccess ot the party.
Dr. Abbott of the Massachusetts Board
of Health is quoted as saying the use of
the bicycle has diminished the death
rate of women in New England from pul
monary diseases, but there are others who
dispute the learned gentleman, and de
clare he has wheels]onjthe brain.
The recommendation of the Governor
that charitable, educational and similar
institutions should be rslieved of the tax
on bequests to them is a good one. It is
for the general welfare that such institu
tions exist and it is absurd to tax the gifts
which liberal men and women bestow
upon them.
The only insinuation of a corrupt use of
money in this Legislature and the only
assertion of a desire of any of the mem
bers to obtain bribes have come from the
Examiner, which is making Perkins' fight.
Is any further proof needed that the in
sinuations are malicious and the asser
tions mere fakes?
In an earnest plea for Perkins the Exam
iner correspondent at Sacramento declares
an inability to see why tne Southern Pa
cific should oppose him, and adds "I
should not thins the railroad would feel
that Perkins was a man to be looked upon
with intense alarm." As the Examiner :s
tne personal organ of Perkins in the con
test this bid for railroad support is "signifi
cant.
The Examiner published yesterday un
der scare heads a long ana lurid story of a
direful mystery and tragedy at Anderson.
The same story was sent to The Call, but
by our correspondent was investigated
and found to be a hoax. The Examiner, of
course, never investigated. It spends so
much time and money on fakes it has
neither for use in getting legitimate news
and getting it right.
While Senator Perkins and his political
manager were haunting the hallways ana
anterooms of county conventions, self
ishly intruding Mr. Perkins' personal in
terest and ambition to succeed himself
into the campaign, Samuel M. Shortridge
was traveling throughout California, elo
quently, ably and unselfishly fighting for
the success of the National ticket and for
the election of a Republican Legislature,
which would alone make possible the
choice of a Republican Senator. Which
of these gentlemen was engaged In the
most laudable effort, and which has
thereby shown himself most worthy of its
reward?
THE DUTY OF DELIBERATION.
The Republican members of the Legislature should not allow themselves to be
unduly hastened in their choice of a Senator, nor to be misled from their duty of
deliberation by any tactics^hich those who rely tor victory upon other things than
merit may sees to employ.
The statutes cf the United States wisely provide for an intermission of more than
a week between the date of organization and the time when the real work of choosing
a Senator shall begin, and they further require that when begun the procedure shall
mo*e slowly. The evident reason lor this delay is to promote that careful canvassing
of the merits of candidates which should result in the selection of the one most emi
nently qualified for the place.
This wise purpose of the Federal laws should not be argued away by any such
nonsense as ante-campaign and ex parte instructions, nor set aside by the dragooning
plan of a caucus of less than a majority of the Legislature. The time has come in
California when such schemes for compelling the selection of the less able candidate
should be frowned upon by every legislator who takes pride in the exercise of his
own independent judgment in the choice of the ablest man.
The lime has also arrived when California should be represented at Washington
by brains instead of moneybags; by an orator and statesman rather than by a million-'
aire; by a man of ideas and eloquence in the place of a -possessor of dollars and cor
porate coupons; by a gentleman of independent mind, of broad culture, of exact and
eloquent expression, aud of far-seeing views of the power and future of our splendid
State, instead of one whose claims to preference are founded upon fortunate invest
ments in lands, or mines, or ships, or stocks. The Republican members of the Legis
lature should give careful thought to these things in determining what quality of man
they will honor with their support.
The friends of Samuel M. Shortridge have based his claims to preference upon
merit alone, and if the merit of a candidate is to be the measure of his success Mr.
Shortridge will surely win. There is no citizen of California to-day who has greater
abilities than he for the diversified duties of a Senator. He has youth, with all its
energies, its ambition, its ardent and untiring effort to attain the honors and suc
cesses of life. He has a personal presence which attracts, and a magnetism of manner
which retains the regard and respect of men. He is an orator of National reputation,
a lawyer of widely recognized ability, and in politics he has been
for years considered and consulted as one of the foremost leaders of the Repub
lican party. Above all, he is a true son of California in his education, his interests and
his sympathies. As a boy he worked in its mines; as a youth he lived amid the
farms and orchards of its fertile valleys, and exhausted all the learning of its public
schools. As a young man he was a public school teacher, and later again a student
in its college of law. His manhood has been devoted to the labors of his profession,
varied only by his unselfish loyalty and willing and distinguished service to the Republi
can party in councils, conventions and campaigns. In all of these capacities he has
schooled himself to a most intimate knowledge of the resources, the rights and the needs
of California until tc-day there is no one among her citizens who is superior in
ability to represent in the Senate the claims of California to favorable legislation and
to a place of influence aud honor amon^ her sister States.
With such a candidate for Senator defore the Legislature, asking only an honest
and deliberate expression of their untrammeled preference, its Republican members
cannot afford to be hasty in their action nor to be enticed into caucuses or alliances
which would in any way impede or prevent their choice for Senator of the candidate
most clearly and eminently qualified for the place.
WHAT do the Republican
member* of the legislature
think of the San Francisco
I\ \TÂ»i>i:i6"S reiterated in.
suit to them and each of them
in its daily suggestion ol* a
"sack" at the Capital and of
the likelihood that blackmail
aud bribery will go liand in
li:intl determining their choice
of a Senator?
THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE.
The first biennial message of Governor
Budd is long enouph to form a fair-sized
volume, aud probably will lie read only by
those who have largo leisure or else take
great interest in public affairs. Neverthe
less it is well worth the reading of every
citizen, inasmuch as it gives a fairly com
plete review of the conditions of our polit
ical institutions, and recommends reme
dies where defects or evils have been
preven by experience to exist.
The Governor devotes the fir?t and most
important part of ii is message to consider
ations of economy. He says: "I turn
from the natural advantages bestowed
upon us to contemplate with regret the
political conditions with which we have
surrounded ourselves." He then pro
ceeds to elaborate upon the extravagance
and waste current in several departments
of the State government, and on tiiis sub
ject makes many recommendations which
will be cordially supported by the people.
The State Board of Examiners is said to
have found official salaries and wages for
the same service exceedingly dispropor
tionate, the number of employes excessive,
alack of uniformity in the system of keep
ing books, and that attendants in the
various asylums vary Rroatly in the ratio
to the inmates thereof. To remedy these
and kindred evils, the Governor recom
mends the appointment of a central body
with power to prescribe tbe number of
employes and their compensation, and
also to have a general business supervision
of the affairs of the institutions of the
State.
The Governor points with satisfaction
to the saving which has been made by
economies introduced during his term of
office. He estimates that by the transfer
of the "Viticultural Commission to the
university, the removai of the office of the
Board of Horticulture to Sacramento and
the veto of appropriations for district
fairs, and by the repeal of the acts grant
ing aid to aged indigents and paying
bounties for coyote scalps, $1,239,451 has
been saved; and adds that "including the
veto of the appropriations for district
agricultural societies, 1 felt constrained to
disapprove of over $1,000,003 of appropria
tion bills."
It is calculated that if the appropria
tions for purposes other than the regular
running expenses of the government be
kept within reasonable bounds the condi
tion of the treasury is such that within
the next two fiscal years, on the present
valuation of property, the tax rate will be
less than 3S cents for $100. and if the grad
uated corporation income tax and the
excise license tax raise $1. 500, 000 between
them for State purposes the people of the
State will be compelled to pay less than
26 cents on the $100 valuation of property.
To emphasize this point the Governor
adds: "The Legislature that accomplishes
this good end will stand out as the greatest
our State has ever had."
In the way of constitutional amend
ments the Governor declares that legis
lative terms of sixty days are too short for
the work of the State, and recommends an
amendment extending the term to not
exceeding 100 days and prohibiting
the introduction of bills in either body
after the first thirty day 3 except in caae3
of urgency. The Governor's term, it is
recommended, snould commence on the
first Monday of July succeeding hi 3 elec
tion, the Legislature to meet in the Janu
ary following, so that each Governor will
have more time at the beginning of his
term to devote to State affairs and the
Legislature amnle leisure in which to
make a study of State institutions, con
sider recommendations and formulate
needed laws.
The message as a whole deserves com
mendation. It is not probable that all ths
recommendations will be adopted, but it is
evident that the Governor has given a
careful consideration to all our State in
stitutions and has labored earnestly to
promote economy and nood government.
It is clear that this Legislature means
to practice economy as well as to talk
about it, and as a consequence it will be
ranked among the best in the history of
the State.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 6, 1897.
MAYOR PHELAN'S ADDRESS.
The inaugural address of Mayor Phelan
is a plea for economy, a review of some of
the departments of our municipal govern
ment in winch waste exists, and an out
line of a policy by which these was:es
may be largely counteracted and the de
sired economy obtained..
The Mayor points out that a new spirit
lis awake in San Francisco. As he says:
"The rise of improvement clubs, the dis
cussion of a new charter and the imposi
tion of an excessive tax have brought the
forces of good government to the front to
j make a battle for better, more progressive
and more widely economical administra
tion of municipal affairs." He reminds
the Supervisors: "The people have ex
pressed confidence in your willingness and
ability to undertake this task, and they
place their reliance in your integrity and
honor." These words we trust will have
due weight with the Supervisors and that
they will cordially co-operate with the
Mayor in establishing a business-like
administration of the affairs of the City.
Mayor Phelan is careful to point out
that economy does not mean' parsimony.
The people desire the public revenue to bo
prudently expended, but they also desire
the accomplishment of -long - needed
! municipal improvements. High taxation
i in the past has been due moie to waste
I and extravagance than to anything else,
| and it is quite possible for the new City
government to provide for economy and
progress at the same time.
The review given by the Mayor of the
places where waste of public money is
! carried on is a repetition of an old story
thoroughly familiar to the people. He
has not covered the whole of this subject,
Dut what he has said is clear and em
phatic. Moreover he promises to call the
attention of the Supervisors at some time
} to other departments which are extrava
gantly conducted, and therefore we may
expect of him in the end a complete an
alysis of this evil iv our municipal admin
istration.
After dealing with some of the more im
portant features of our municipal life,
such as tin water and lighting supply,
the school department, streets and high
ways, railway franchises and the health
department, the Mayor returns again to
the importance of economy. In conclu
sion he says:
The watchword of our administration must
then be, and the sentiment involves no incon
sistency, enlightened economy and municipal
progress. San Franclsoo, by reason of Its loca
tion, is one of the great cities of the world,
and it snould also, with its natural advan
tages, be one of tbe most attractive and pros
perous cities. I trust that you will dedicate
your labors to realization of these ends.
On the policy thus outlined, the Mayor
will have the cordial approval of tbe
people of San Francisco. Progress and
economy are watchwords which euit the
new opportunities that are opening in our
city. We must go forward and our going
will be dependent upon the sagacity of
those who have been entrusted with
charge of our municipal affairs. Mayor
I'helan will have the general support of
his feliow-citizens in the work he has out
lined and a cordial co-operation to assist
him in making his administration a credit
to himself and a benefit to the munici-
pality.
THE INHERITANCE TAX.
Among the features of the Governor's
message which deserve special considera
tion is that referring to the tax on col
lateral inheritances, so far as it affects
charitable, educational, eleemosynary and
like institutions. The Governor recom
mends that the tax on bequests to these
bodies hould be abolished and the recom
mendation is certainly deserving of adop
tion by the Legislature.
As tne Governor says: "While it is
complained that the amount expended by
the State for the care of orphans, etc.,
continues to increase with alarming rapid
ity, and some safeguard must be thrown
around this law if we are to keep within
the bounds of reasonable economy, I hope
you will not be aeterrcd thereby from in
cluding these classes and tie institutions
devoted to their care in the exemption."
As an evidence of the benefit to be
gained by exempting charitable institu
tions from the tax on collateral inherit
ance it may be pointed out that on the
bequests made by the late Senator Fair
there would-be saved $2500 to the Protest
ant orphan asylums, $2500 to Catholic or
phan asylums and $1250 to the Hebrew
orphan asylums of this City. These sums
woald be of comparatively little value to
the State, but would aid those charitable
institutions largely in their good work
and would help to educate children to be
come useful citizens of the common
wealth. A
The subject hardly needs argument. It
is plain even to the unreflecting that the
State can gain nothing from taxing such
institutions and weakening their benefits
to those who need help. A tax upon
charity and education is literally a tax
upon the children and the poor of the
commonwealth who have no money of
their own and no relatives or friends to
help them. What is taken from them
must be made up either by State aid or by
the liberality of generous men and women.
There can be therefore no profit to the
State from such a tax, and the sooner
such institutions are relieved from the
operation of the present law the better it
will be for all.
AUDACITY ASD INSULT.
The San Francisco Examiner, which has
either made itself or lias been made the
organ of Senator Perkins, and the arrogant
advocate of his re-election, has furnished
the Republicans of California with food
for serious thought.
Is it among the possibilities that this
Isumaelite arotfng newspapers, this
outcast in journalism which has
so lately been publicly scourged and pil
loried for offenses against truth and de
cency which only a shameless pander
among publications would dare to at
tempt, can have any favorable influence
upon the choice of a Senator by a Repub
lican Legislature? Is it a thing to be per
mitted that the newspaper which, as the
organ of the fusionists during the recent
campaign, spewed its venom at the leaders
and candidates of the Republican party,
and especially endeavored to defeat its
nominees to the Legislature, should now
dictate to the very men whom it libeled
and maligned and vilified which way
their duty lies?
If we mistake not the character and
temper of the Republican members of tue
Legislature, they will regard the Examin
er's support of Mr. Perkins as a disaster
to his hope ana a most convincing reason
for his defeat.
EX-PARTE INSTEUCTIONS.
Tho San Francisco Examiner and other
supporters of Senator Perkins are insist
ing with great vehemence upon the bind
ing force upon members of the Legislature
of the indorsements which were given to
Senator Perkins by some county conven
tions at the beginning of the recent cam
paign. They declare these indorsements
are of such force that no legislator can
vote for any other man for United States
Senator without being guilty of something
like party treason, and assert that Senator
Perkins has a lien upon the senatorship
which no man in the State has a right to
dispute.
Claims of this kind will hardly have
any weight with men of intelligence. No
man can assert that the senatorship is
his property without a degree of arro
gance and assumption which will be
offensive to every legislator, who has a
rightful sense of his own dignity or the
responsibilities of his office. The indorse
ments given to Senator Perkins are not in
any sense binding upon a legislator. The
conventions which gave them were not
chosen for the purpose of electing a
United States Senator, and therefore had
no authority to bind those who are
charged with that duty under the law.
It is easy to see how Senator Perkins
obtained such indorsements as were given
to him. The contest before the Republi
cans of the State in the last campaign was
a most difficult and arduous one. The
fusion winch had been brought about be
tween silver Republican^ Democrats and
Populists threatened to subvert the Re
publican forces in the State and to carry
California for Bryan. Under those cir
cumstances every patriotic member of the
Republican party laid aside all thought of
personal advantage or ambition, and
strove earnestly for the success of the
party without consideration of seltish in-
teresls. Those who were less loyal had
therefore a free field for tne display of
tbeir personal ambitions and easily se
cured indorsements.
It was well known to the abler leaders
of the Republican party that if a contest
arose over the senatorsuip which would
divide and carry dissensions into the
rank and tile the party would be hope
lessly beaten. They therefore stood aside
from such a contest and sought only to
make sure of a victory for McKinley elec
tors and a Republican Legislature. There
was but one Republican in the State who
intruded his personal ambitions into the
contest and subordinated ttie party to
himself. He had a clear field for the ex
ercise of his talents in gaining indorse
ments, and it is not to be wondered
that when no rival appeared he should
have succeeded in deriving something of
personal advantage from inconsiderate
county conventions.
Indorsements given in this way are
purely "ex parte." They result from the
hearing of one side only. The Republican
leaders who earnestly desired the success
of their party did not care to combat this
demonstration of selfishness, as they
feared the contest would be moro disas
trous than the selfishness itself. In their
high regard for public welfare and the
interests of genuine Republicanism they
avoided this danger of party dissension
and acted in such a way as to bring about
the victory which was accomplished.
Unaer the constitution the Legislature
of the State is charged with the responsi
bility of choosing the representative of the
State in the United States Senate. Loyal
Republicans did not endeavor to forestall
the action of the Legislature nor to de
prive the members of that body of the
rights which their duty under the consti
tution gives them. It is the right of a
legislator to act freely in accordance with
the dictates of his judgment and his con
science in the selection of a Senator, and
no legislator can surrender tnat right
without sacrifice not only of his personal
dignity but dl his official responsibility.
THE USUAL INCONSISTENCY.
The New York Journal in its issue of
somewhat more than a week ago con
tained an article upon Senator Perkins,
accompanied with a caricature wherein
he was held up to contempt and ridicule
as a sort of unctuous nonentity, a make
believe statesman and a laughing stock
among the lawmakers at Washington.
The issue of the Journal containing the
article had just abou^ time to reach Cali
fornia when Mr. Hearst's local organ en
tered upon an advocacy of Mr. Perkins'
re-election to the Senate with a fulsome
ness of flattery ana a dejrree of
partisanship as audacious as it was
unexpected, even in a newspaper of
the Examiner's well-known aptitude for
the extreme. A comparison of these op
posing views of Mr. Hearst's two news
papers suggests the idea that the Exam
iner is supporting Mr. Perkins in order
that the New York Journal may have a
suitable target in the event of his election.
This is not, however, the only thing of
which the Examiner's editorial support of
Mr. Perkins is strongly suggestive.
At the close of his long message Gov
ernor Budd says "Some of our depart
ments I have not touched on." This may
be a hint that the document is to be a serial
story.
PERKINS
San .Francisco Post.
Many good men in this State who are
aware of the fact that Senator Georae C.
Perkins is not our greatest or our wisest
Republican are in favor of abandoning the
contest against him at Sacramento on the
ground that several legislators have been
pledged to vote for him and no one ran
against him in the late canvass. The Post
ia in favor of electing Senators by popular
vote. Four years ago it visorously agi
tated their nomination by State conven
tions. We believe that as a result of that
agitation Mr. Perkins went to the county
conventions of the State, made his claim-*
and secured a sufficient number of votes to
defeat M. H. de Young, the so-calied
"railroad candidate."'
But nevertheless we are not in favor of
abandoning the fight against Mr. Perkins
because tie has succeeded in pledging a
sufficient number of members to control
the caucos at Sacramento. Our principal
reason is that we think the State has had
enough of Mr. Perkins. He has served us
now about three years. That is as long as
we could stand him in the Governor's
office, and there is no good reason why the
1 Republican party should inflict him upon
us for six years longer in the United States
Senate. There are fifty Republicans
available who are wiser and abler and who
can do more for their party in the Senate
than he.
Senator Perkins is a follower, not a
leader. Personally he is liked and, having
risen from cabin-boy on a clipper to the
proud station of a steamship millionaire,
he is naturally admired by plain prople.
But in all his* public career he has never
said anything or done anything that will
outlast his generation. The Republican
party has men who are intellectually his
superiors aud who, if elected to the Sen
ate, woald Jeave a mark behind them.
There will be a vacancy in the office of
United States Senator from California if
Mr. Perkins is re-elected.

"Here's Youb Mui.k"â F. M. ( City. The
following is given as the origin of the cry
"Here's your mule," that was popular in the
Confederate army during the War of the Re
bellion: In the fall of 1861, after the battle
of Mauassa. 5 , a farmer came one day into
Beau regard's camp near Centerville in search
of a stray mule. Some of the boys swore that
they had seen the mule in the camp of aa
other division, half a mile away, but hardly
had the old farmer started when they shouted :
"Come back, Mister; here's your mule!" He
turned to retrace his steps. Immediately the
other camp, knowing only that some fun was
on loot, cried out: ".Mister, they uns lyin' to
you uns. We uns have got you uns' mule"â a
travesty on the dialect of the troops from the
North Carolina Mountains. As he turned in
that direction he was hailed from Â»till an
other camp with "No, they haven't; here's
your mule." And so the whole army joined
in and had the bewildered countryman thane
ing his course as the cry came from quarter 10
quarter, "Here's your mule." The phrase
"caught on" after the Incidents of its origin
were forgotten, and was everywhere rapeated
upon all sorts of occÂ»sions. One thing that
helped to make it popular was that it formed
the refrain of a parody on "My Maryland"
satirizing the supposed disposition of some vi
the Maryland reingees to seek "shade" offices
rather than field duty.

EIGHT HOURS IN
AN OPEN BOAT
Two Women and Two Men
at the Mercy of the
Waves.
From Off Sausalito the Tide
Carried Them Down to
Lime Point.
The Women Were Rescued by the
Steamer Sco ia, bat the Men
Stayed by the Boat-
Two men and two women had a lively
time of Hin a plunger last Monday night.
The wind died out and the tide taking
command carried the boat down to Lime
Point. There the anchor was dropped,
and luckily it held. Night began to fall
and the boatmen were in a predicament.
Just how to get their female companions
back to Sausalito they did not know.
Finally one of the men sucgested rowing
the women ashore in a little dingey that
was towing behind the plunger, and then
they could walk home or stay all night at
the fog station. The attempt was made,
but it only ended in the women getting
thoroughly drenched in the breakers and
the boat almost capsizing. The return to
the boat was made without any mishap,
and then all four bÂ»can watching for an
incoming vessel, fceveral were hailed but
did not heed the signals. Auout 6p. M.
the Scotia from Albion hove in sigh', and
CaDtain Johnson at once stopped his ves
sel in answer to the frantic cries of the
terror-stricken women. The little dingey
was. apain put into requisition and the
two women were put aboard the steam
schooner. The man went bacK to the
plunger and the women were landed at
Mission-sweet wharf in time to catch the
last boat for Sausalito. The plunger re
mained at anchor off Lime Point until the
tide turned aud then she was sailed back
to her reeuiar anchorage.
"All 1 couid gather from the two ladies,"
said Captain Johnson, "was that they
were beguiled into an attempt at saiiing
from bausalito to San Francisco instead
of taking the regular boat. When I picked
them up they were ha'f dead with the
cold and both were in tears. The men
preferred to remain by their boat and
would not accept a tow."
BA.USALIIO, Cal., Jan. s.â Mrs. Mary
"Wilbur and Mis. Annie Turshea were
taken out for a sail in a small sloop by a
couple of men yesterday, ihe intention
was to finally reach San Francisco, but
the wind died out and the boat was ear
ned by the current down to Lime Point,
where the anchor was dropped. After
eight hours of misery the women were !
finally rescued by tne steamer Scotia and j
taken to San Francisco. Tne young men
brought the sloop back to Sausalito early
this morning, wet, hungry, tired and dis
gusted. Tne sloop was a borrowed one j
and the names of the men cannot be

him around town again yesterday. He is |

never expected to see him alive ajzain.
He not oniy underwent the operation |
successfully but is now in splendiu health j

at sea he never met with an accident.
The well-known steamer Portland, for
merly tiie Hay lian Reouolic, is practically
iv the course of reconstruction. Over $20,
--000 is to be spent on her. New engines
and boilers will be put in, the cabn will
be reconstructed and a new deckhouse
built. When completed she will run be
tween fcan Francisco and Alaska in con
nection with the North American Trans
portation and Trading Company and the
Alaska Commercial Company's steamers
on the Yukon River. These latter are
powerful stern-wheel boats, and make
the run down the river from Ci cle Ciiy,
Forty Mile and Fort Cudaby in from
twenty to twenty-five days. This way of
getting from the mines is less expensive
and a third quicker than the overland
route. The Portland will be ready for
business early in the spring.

FIVE-MILE CLUB.
Profitable meeting of Progressive Mis
siun Residents â New Officers

Gilfeather and Torclio.
As chairman of the committee ap
pointed to interview the directors of the
Spring Valley Water Company, Mr. Lewis
reported that the company had agreed to
.ay water-mains out Mission street as far
as China avenue. The mains are even
now being laid, and the work will be corn
p.eted in two weeks.
The committee on constitution and by
laws, composed of M. H. Levy (chairman),

AFTER THE MUSIC
THERE WAS WAR
Thomas Paul, a Young Man,
Accused of Grand
Larceny.
Joseph F. Perini, a Ritch-Street
Grccer, the Complaining
W.tness.
Perini Charges Paul With Stealing a
Box Containing Coin and Arti
cles of Valu\
Joseph F. Perini, a grocer, at 310 Ritch
street, gave a musical party and reception
on New Year's night, and a large number
of friends availed themselves of the op
portunity to spend a pleasant time.
Among the guests was Thomas Paul, a
young man wuo was paying his addresses
to a niece of the host, and had for a few
mouths taken charge of the grocery
during Perini's illness.
The party was a great success, but next
morning Perini was thrown into a state
of wild excitement by discovering that
a box containing bis bankbook, $223
coin, several luuirets of gold and other
valuable articles had been stolen.
The box was kept in a secret place in a
small room off the kitchen an 1 its pres
ence there was only known to Perini and
his family. It suddenly dawned upon
him that Paul also knew where the box
was kepr, as he had deposited bin money
in it while employed in the store during
his illness. His suspicions fell upon Paul
and he notified the Southern polica sta
tion.
Policemen T. L. Ryan and ODea were
detailed on the ca.^e and Saturday Paul
was arrested and locked up in "the
tanks" pending further developments.
Monday tiie box was returned, to Perini
by a messenger-boy, who said he brought
it from the Louvre saloon on O'Farrell
street, where a man gave it to him with
instructions to 'afce It to Perini's resi
dence. The boy departed and Perini
hastily examined the contents of the
box and found that the money was $45
short.
Kynn and O'Daa have been making
every effort to rind the messenger-boy, but
so far without success, as he might give
them a clew to the man who gave him the
box.
Perini yesterday morning swore to a
complaint in Judge Joachimaen's court
charging Paul with grand larceny, and
last night the charge was booked against
him. Perini claims he can prove that
Paul was seen ttealthily gome through
the kitchen to the room where the box
was kept and that he stole it.
Paul has a different story to tell. HÂ«
says: "I was invited 10 the party and
went. I was never out of the room where
the guests were oil the time I was there
except lor a minute or two, but I did not
ro into the room where the box was kept.
I knew it was kept there when I was
working in the grocery, but that was some
months ago.
â¢"VViien I left the bouse that night Peri
ni's niece saw me to the door and I kissed
her pool-night. I could not have had ihe
box without her seeing it."
Paul lias engaged Attorney Kelly to de
fend him ami bays be will make it inter
esting for Perini before he is done with
him.
Ryan and ODea found the messenger
boy last night. His name is Max Cohen
of the San Francisco Di.-trict Telegraph
Company. He says he answered a cali
from the Louvre, 12 O'Farrell street, ana
when he reached there a young man who
was seated at a table drinking beer gave
him a parcel to take to Perini's house,
paying him the usual fee. He gave a de
scription of the young man, and Ryan
and ODea think they know him. .
It now turns out that it was not the
stolen box that was returned, but a paper
one, and that besides the $45 five bank
books nnd deeds to property owned by Pe
rini were also stolen. Perini is more wor
ried about the loss of the ueeds than the
money. _^___________

EXAMINERS CAN
HAVE AN EXPERT
Important Decision Ren
dered by the Supreme
Court.
Controller Colgan Must Fay
Thomas A. Lewis His Sa'ary
as Claimed.
While the Law Does Not Prcvide for
an Expert the Burl cf Exami
ners May Appoint.
A very important matter was determined
yesterday by the Supreme Court, sitting
in bank. The issue was whether the State
Board of Examiners was justified in ap
pointing an expert and providing for pay
ing him a salary whon there was no ex
press provision in the law for such an
appointment.
The board appointed Thomas A. Lewis
as such expert, at a salary of $2000 per an
num. Controller Colgan refused to draw
a warrant in payment for his services for
the month of July, 1895. Mandamus pro
ceedings were instituted. Once a decision
was Riven by Department 1 of the Su
preme Court against Lewis. Yesterday
the court, in bank, reversed the decision
of the department in bank and found for
Lewis, sustaining the Superior Court.
There never was any question whether
Lewis performed the duties of the postion
during the month for wnich he claimed
$166 66% as salary due. The Supreme
Court ii>und ttiat the duty of Controller
Colgan to draw a warrant in favor of
Lewis depended upon the question
whether the Board of Examiners i:ad the
authority to appoint the expert.
There was no law, so the court found,
that la express terms created the office of
expert to the board, but the act matting
appropriations for the board made pro
vision for the payment of an expert. An
office could not be created by a general ap
propriation bill; but it appeared that
there was an attempt on t'.ie part of trie
Legislature to create an office, and provi
sion was made for the payment of his sal
ary and expenses.
The duties conferred upon the Board of
Examiners anil the corresponding author
ity conferred upon them by the express
terras of the various sections of the Civil
Code and other statutes defining their
duties were such as might involve the em
ployment of an expert for their due and
efficient discharge, and it followed that
the examiners had the rower to employ
an expert where it was nee ssary, inde
pendent of the clause of the law making
appropriations. It did not follow from
this view that the powers of the board in
tnis regard were unlimited anil unre
stricted. If the Legislature could make
an appropriation Â»o pay for services after
they were rendered the court could see no
reason why an appropriation could not be
made in advance sufficient to cover the
anticipated expenses in this case. Under
ihis decision Expert L?wis will probably
collect his whole back salary. In addition
to tha question personal to Lewis, the
court authorizes the board to have an ex
pert, which is a matter of more impor
tance. ______^_^______
THE PEOPLE'S TELEPHONE.
What the New Company Proposes to
Do if It Meets With the Sup-
poit >'ceded.
"Now that we have secured a decision
in our favor," said President Criitenden of
the People's Mutual Telephone Company
yesterday, "we are going right along, and
the prospects are that we shall be soon in
a pesition to carry into effect the proposi
tion to establish and maintain what the
name of the company implies â people's
telephone.
'â¢It is the intention of the company to
build lims to all parts of the State, go
where other lines now are in operation
and to places where none are in operation
at this time, and we will go further: we
will establish communication with Port
land. 0 . It is the purpose to expend
$1,000,000 in establishing a plant, but,
mind you, nothing will be done unless the
company nas the written assurance of cus
tomers that they will support it. We do
not propose to lay out money, cheap
rates and tnen if unoiher company comes
down to our rates have our customers . d< -

days ago they are meeting with encour

DEFENDS A 54/ V DIEGO JUDGE.
Atorner Withdrcws His Name From a
Brief in Which the Court Was
Attacked.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. s.â An unusual
scene was witnessed in Judge Torrence's
department of the Super. or Court thia
morning. Oscar A. Trippet, a prominent
member of the bar, in open court repu
diated the language in a brief to which
his name was attached, and threw the
responsibility upon his associate counsel,
Works ft Works. The language in ques
tion was said to have been scandalous and
lice'.ous, ana was directed against Judee
Torrence, and addressed to the Supreme
Court. Mr. Triplet's remarks, accord
ingly, caused a sensation among the at
torneys of the cily.
â¢'ln the case of the Saa Diego Water
Company vs. the City of San Diego," sa-d
Mr. Trippet. "on appeal from an order
(ienying a chance of venue, I desire to s-ay
in open court that the firai of Trippet i
Neale disclaims any responsibility for any
scandalous and impertinent matter con
tained in a brief filed in the Supreme
Court in ihe case to wnich the firm's name
is attached.
"1 have heretofore explained to the
Judge ol Dep&Ttment 1 how, inadver
ient:v, we had assented to our name Lemg
subscribed to tbe c-rief, and wnea our ar.en
tion was cabled to the b:ief a3 printed we
advised the- withdrawal of certain matter
Irom it. We shall withdraw our names
Jrcm the brief, and we apolocize for tlius
inadvertently having committed what I
de<-m au impropriety."
Tnese remarks by Mr. Trippet piaced
the responsibility tor the language upon
the oiher attorneys whose nam ? were
subscribed to the brief â Works it Works.
The name of this firm, however, was not
mentioned in the brief discussion of the
matter by Mr. Tr.ppet, nor by Judge Tor
rence in his courteous reply to Mr. Trip
let's disclaimer. The language referred
to has not been made pub ie, out is un
derstood to allege, in substance, that
Judge Toirence decided a certain water
case before ejection in order to have him
self re-elected, or upon a promise of re
election.

STOCKTON'S NOVEL SUIT.
Witnesses Dec/are They Hare Seen a Man
Who Was Dtc'ared Dead by the
Super/or Court.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. s.â Elliott &
Elliott, as attorneys for the A. 0- U. W M
prepared to-day a document of considera
ble importance in connection with the
contemplated suit of Mrs. Albert Polsky
against that order for $2000 as her hus
band's insurance. Mrs. Polsky claims
lhat her husband is dead, because he has
not been heard from for sev?n years, but
there are those who claim to have seen
him within the last three year?.
The document prepared to-day is what
is called a pesiiion to perpetuate testi
mony. Under it Henry Voss will be ex
amined within the next five days. He
will testify that he has seen Pol?ky in the
town of David, district of Chenque, State
of Granaiia, United States of Loiombia.
There is anotner witness, Charles Hil
dreih, formerly of Farmington, who is
now i i Sou'.h America, and before any
further action is taken hi 3 evidence is to
be obtained. The iod^e was about to pay
the insurance on Polsky's li'.e about a
month a-o, wh.-n a local barber tnid its
:1s that if it would pay nim $500 he
would prove that Po sky was sii.i aive.
The locige has since refused to pay the in
surance, and the suit is the outgrowth of
ihis refusal.
Mrs. Polsky recently applied to the
court to declare her husband dead a:id
this was done. When Polsky disappeared
from Stockton it w..s believed he had been
murdered.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 6, 1897.
SACRAMENTO DOG
AND FOWL SHOW
| Annual Exhibition of the
Poultry and Kennel
Association.
Hundreds of Aristo:ratic Canines
and Birds Will Pose Ee
fore Spectators.
Everything Is in Rerdiness for the
Formal Opening of the Pavi!
ioa ToDay.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 5. â To
morrow will be the opening day of the
State Poultry and Kennel As^ciation's
meeting, being the fourth anr.ual exhibi
tion of poultry and the first annual exhibi.
tion of dogs held under its auspices. The
show will continue eight days and will be
held in the State Agricultural Pavilion.
For the first four days Chanticleer and
his numerous harem will reign supreme,
the only other candidates for public ad
miration being a few rabbits, ( ducks, tur
keys, geese, peafowls and pigeons. There
will be great rivalry among the pigeon
exhibitors.
There are over 400 entries of the choicest
selections of various breeds, many of
which saw the light in some of Â»he fur
thermost corners of the earth, notably an
alien in the Wanga breed, the parents
coming from Souto Africa; and there are
Russian and Siberian birds, pigeons irom
Australia and Indiaâ pigeons white, red,
black and blue, Jacobins, pouters, high
flyers, carriers and other varieties.
There are now 1500 entries of chickens,
comprising the finest strains on the coast.
The display of barred Plymouth Rocks is
especially fine, there being row upon row
of coops filled with great, plump birds,
whose appearance alone would make the
mouth cf an epicure water. There are
Brahmas of ail shades of color present,
silver- spangled Wyandottes, buff Co
chins, Langsbaws, tiny bantams and big,
fierce-looking games, whose sole ambition,
seemin. ly, is to escape from their places
of imprisonment and meet in mortal
combat those other members of their sex
whose shrill crows excite the curiosity of
the female Diros, causing them to rubber
neck around the corners of their coops to
see if the crowers are good-looking and
on the mash.
Over in one corner of the pavilion are a
limited number of bronze turkeys, and
:iuge fellows t:iey are. Near them a
number of peafowl spread their gorgeous
plumage and utter sfcriii crie-<. Taken all
in ail the display of poultry promises to
be one of the most meritorijus ever wit
nessed in the State. Those in charge are:

estate of Charles Lux, deceased, was made
by Judge E. F. Fitzpatnck, allowing J. H.
Campb?ll as attorney for absen* and minor
; heirs $1000 a month. Campbell has up to

The case was brought before Judge George
H. Buck for hearing, but he requested

Belcher made nn order revoking the order
of IS9O.
n Carrier I'igeon,
PETALUMA, Cal., Jan. 5. â Boys re
turning from a hunting trip yester
day had their attention attracted
to a pigeon, evidently weary from a
long flight, circling round the building
near the race:rack at Agricultural Park.
A well-directed shot brought the bird to
the ground with a wound in ihe tip of its
wing. The boys discovered it to be a car
rier pigeon, with c message tied undor its
wincr, the date proving that it had left
Walla Walla four days before its unlucky
deiention. The missive was addressed to
Messrs. A. Carlisle & Co., San Francisco,
who. upon being communicated wi'.n,
telegraphed to have all possible care taken
of the bird. They asked lhat it bs sent to
them, where, with good care, it will re
cover the use of its wing and be ready for
further flights.
JUISSJAO Fit 031 CORVAZhIS.
Friends of Â« Liveryman Believe lhat
He HVi# Murdered.
CORVALLIS, Or., Jan. s.â The mys
tery surrounding the death or disappear
ance of James Eglin, a liveryman, who is
supposed to have been drowned in the
Willamette River while intoxicated Satur
day morning, has not yet been cleared.
The river has been dragged without re
suit. Public opinion in Corvaliis is that
Eigin was murdered, but how or why can
not be explained.
E^lin and William Williams of the
Elgin stables left Albany after midnieht
in carriages to drive to Corvaliis. Two
well-known and respectable ladies accom
panied them, because they had missed a

DUG THROUGH
PRISON WALLS
Yuma Penitentiary Con
victs Toil Patiently
to Escape.
Tunnel From the Prison, to B?
Detected When Freedom
Is at Hand.
Scores of Desperate Characters Fail
in a Clever Attempt to
Escape.
YUMA, Ariz., Jan. 5. â The most daring
and best laid plan for escape in the his
tory of the Arizona Territorial peniten
tiary was discovered last ni?ht by acci
dent, and a large number of Arizona's
criminals who were figuring on a vacation
will be compelled to linger a while in the
"snake den" and subsist on bread and
water.
The project was shrewdly managed,
and that it was unsuccessful was no fault
of those gambling with fate for their free
dom.
The shop where the convicts manufac
tured onyx ornaments 9tands about thirty
feet from the north wall of the prison in
closure, ana to reach the outside by means
of an underground passage from the shop
was the daring plan concocted by the con
victs.
Over thirty feet of an adamantine
cement formation must be dug through,
eight feet of solid rocs under the outside
wall must be penetrated, but the reward
for the work was to be liberty, and they
deemed the end justified the means.
In the onyx shop stand a numDer of
chests used for holding the rock the work
men use, and one of these was made to
conceal the mouth of the tunnel and the
men working their way to freedom. The
bottom was taken from the box, a convict
hid inside and the cover was closed and
locked. Then the work began, and a hole
four or five feet deep and large euough to
adm-.t of a man working handily was dug
straight down.
From there the tunnel was started
straight for the north wall of the inciosure,
slanting slightly upward, so as to strike
the open air outside the prison wall at a
favorable place.
The dirt was removed from the tunnel
by means of a flour sack. Whenever the
workman underground had filled the sacK
be would tap on the box concealing the
mouth of the opening, the lid would be
opened and the sack of dirt removed and
concealed in other chests.
Several chests were. tiled in this way, as
a large amount of excavating was required
to mate the tunnel.
The work was carried on so carefully
that the uig ing of the tunnel was com
pleted. The pushing out of a rock would
have cleared the passageway to freedom,
and perhaps to-night the break would
heve been made.
From thirty to forty men work in the
onyx shop, and th* y were probably all en
gaged in the desperate eir.erprise. Now
that the tunnel has been found, evidences
of most carefu.iy and wisely laid plans
are discernible on every hand.
On the tirst favorable night some con
v.ct would have tapped the "sick" signal
on his cell, and when the guard on duty
in the cellhouse entered, he would have
b?en knocked senseless or killed, if
necessary, his keys secured and the pris
oners liberated from their cells.
F.rom tho cellbouse a 'corridor leads to
the dining-hall, on the west end of which
and near to the onyx hou-e, where the
tunnel started, is a window concealed by
bashes from the eyes of the guards. To
remove tne iron bars of this window
would have been short work and egress
could have been made.
From there into the onyx house was a
distance of but a few steps. Once in the
onyx house the coa-<t would have been
clear, and a very few moments would
have sufficed to" have made the under
ground passage to freeaom.
The authorities are reticent as to how
the plan was discovered, but it is not im
probable that a trusty who knew of the
project exposed it. About 230 convicts
are confined in the penitentiary, and a
large number of exceptionally desperate
men are included among them.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Jan. s.â There

Special interest exists on account of the

The friends of Charles A. Fairbanks,

claim is substantiated by the fact that the
other candidates are not gathering
strength or doing much active work.
Hiram Brownlee's recent withdrawal is
taken as a strong card in the interest of
Fairbanks, whose friends are also making
much of the fact that General Lew Wal

Informal caucusing has been going on

th 3 breach between the Democrats and

IN CHINATOWN
The Chinese Merchants'
Exchange Split Into
Factions.
See Yup and Sam Yup â¢ High
binders Likely to Go to
Killing Again.
The Animosity Intensified by Gov
ernmental Punishment and R â¢
cent Local Murders.
The v:&r clouds are gathering over
Chinatown again, and unless something
unlooked for happens to clear the atmos
phere thft police will have their hands full
before very long. Those most familiar
with the inside workings of the local
Chinese look for the Sam Yup and See
Yup families to break out before long in
one of the most bloody and murderous
factional rights that this City has ever
experienced.
Old business ties among the Chinese
merchants, ties ihat it was thought no
trouble would destroy, have been severed,
and all that is needed to start the battle is
the rirst shot. The feeling of unrest has
noticeably increased within the last week
or two.
At tiie last meeting of the members of
the Chinese Merchants' Exchange, upon a
given signal, seventy-five influential See
Yap merchants withdrew from the ex
change. Henceforth there will be two
Chinese Merchants' Exchanges. There is
more significance in this fact than appears
stt first sight. Hitherto, through all the
factional tights, boycotts, etc., t::e Chinese
Merchants' Exchange stood intact. It has
always been held that business interests
that they held in common and that were
at stake were too important to be dis
turbed.
Any one who knows anything of the
volume of business transacted by these
Chinese merchants would easily appreciate
such a view of the situation. Some idea,
therefore, may be had of the increased
feeling of animosity from the secession at
the meeting of the exchange a few nights
ago. T c cablegram announcing the con
fiscation of property and imcrisonment in
China of relatives of such of the See Yups
as had taken part in the different rights in
San Francisco no doubt hail something to
do with the split in the exchange.
S.n:u!taneously those on guard in China
town have felt a stronger undercurrent of
factional animosity throughout China
town. Even the normally stoic faces have
assumed a more set and determined look
than ever. More Chinese have beÂ«Mi
noticed to walk with their hands under
their blouses, where doubtless are con
cealed the hatchet, the dirkknife or the
pistol. There is undoubtedly an intensified
atmosphere in Chinatown, and unless
some unforeseen event should happen one
of the bitterest wars ever known ia San
Francisco may yet be fought.
This war, in addition to what is taking
place in China, will be accelerated by the
killing of Jew Sin?, a See Yup man. Jew
S:nz has been traced to one of the sporting
larlors run by a notorious Sam Yup gam
bler, a few days be/ore the iormer's death.
It has ben ascertained that on that occa
sion Jew Sing lost and refused to pay,
alleging lraud on the part of the Sam Yup
members of the gambling fraternity,
â whereupon one of the Sam Yups said,
"Never mind, let him go. We will have
something of his that he values more than
his gold, and that within a week from
now." Jew Sing was murdered four days
afterward.
All of these things the police are not
ignorant of, and without doubt the first
outbreak on the part of the Chinese man
tillers will see a strong force of officers
placed in the Chinese quarter and drasiic
measures will be taken to put a stop to the
threatened butchery. In the past the
authorities have looked to the Chinese
business men for assistance in suppress
ine trouble, but when their Merchants'
Exchange breaks into factions it will
scarce be wondered that the lawless ele
ment will oe only too glad for a chance to
let loose their unbriJled passions.
BEENNAFS DEFENSE.
Young Nicholas ICelie* on a Technical
Point to Regain Hi* Liberty,
Judge Cook heard argument yesterday
in the two applications of Nicholas Bren
nan for writs of habeas corpus. The
charges against Brennan are criminal as
sault on Theresa Tarpey and compelling
her against hei will to enter a house of
ill-repute. She was about 16 years old at
the time of the alleged criminal acts.
Attorney James H. Long appeared for
the prisoner and argued that he ought to
be released f rum the custody of tlie Sheriff,
where he is held in default of $3000 bail,
because the complaint does not uffirma
tively aver that the woman is not Bren
nati's wife.
Jud^e Cook said it was true that some
courts had held that it was a fatal defect
for a compiaint to fail to show that the
â woman was not the wife of the prisoner
â where a charge of criminal assault was
made, yet it was ai;o true that the Supe
rior Court of San Francisco has almost
universally ruled that where any t>rouf at
all is presented at the preliminary exam
ination to sustain the cliaree the defend
ant is not entitled to be discharged.
I'eputy District Attorney Hosmer read
from the testimony of the young woman
to show that the matters complained of
happened on the night of the day on which
the defendant and the complaining wit
ness met, and that the circumstances show
that she was not the defendant's wife.
The court remarked that the testimony
presented was . very unsatisfactory and
that it was improbable that a conviction
could ever be secured if the case should
go to trial, yet he was not prepared to turn
the prisoner loos-, as there seemed to be a

INSPECTED THE DOME.
Mayor Phelan Takes a Trip Through
the Intricacies of the Hall.
Mayor Phelan took his iirst official trip
through the labyrinths of the City
Hall attic and dome yesterday, accom
panied by City and County Attorney
Creswell and Auditor Broderick. The
progress of the work in the dome was ex
| lamed to the Mayor and he asked many
fjuestions as to the time it would take to
linish the tall superstructure.
The fence that hides from public view
the rotunda of the dome interested him
particularly and he was anxious to know
how soon it could be removed. The trip
was taken after the m eting of the City
Hall Commissioners, over which Mr. Phe
lan presided for the first time.
Remembered His Mother.

GEORGE W. MEADE
HAS PASSED AWAY
He Was Prominent Among
the California Mer
chants.
Pioneered the Way to Eastern
Markets for Many Home
Products.
Restless and Enterprisiog He Engaged
in Large Schemes and Won
and Lost Fortunes.
George W. Meade is dead. He wa3 one
of the most enterprising of California
merchants. He is credited with having
been the pioneer in the matter of the in
troduction of California dried fruits to
the Eastern market. In this line while
others followed him hestood pre-eminent.
His annual transactions when he was in
business in this City ran Into large figures.
Early seeing the merits of and possibili
ties for California dried fruits, he also be
lieved in the future of California raisins.
While only Spanish raisins were in the
markets in the East, Mr. Meade engaced
in raisin-growin_' and packing at Fresno
and was largely identified with that in
dustry.
He was of a restless temperament, vig
orous and active in all things. He left bis
impress on many communities. In addi
tion to his operations in San Francisco
and Fresno he was an active mover in the
early history of Santa Barbara. He was
one of the promoters of Riverside. In
his later years he engaged largely in real
estate dealing and building at Redlands,
where he was, as he had been elsewhere, a
leading figure.
He was not contented with advertising
his own products in the East. Wherever he
went he succeeded through interviewers,
who always found him ready and agreeable,
in making known tue climate and produc
tion of the State, and bis gracious if en
thusiastic statements undoubtedly caused
many Eastern people to visit California
and to make investments here.
Many stories could be told concerning
hi? shrewdness, and many more could be
told illustrative of his geniality and nni
form kindness, by which he won hosts of
friends without effort. He lived in Cali
fornia about twenty-five years. He was
born in Toledo, Ohio, and* came to this
State in 187 L He was at first engaged in
fruit-raising at Santa Barbara. He also
passed a Bhort time at Santa Rosa. The
greater part of the time that he resided
in this State he made San Francisco his
business headquarters.
In this City he was first connected with
Littlefield, Webb & Co., commission mer
chants, and while with that firm he
learned much about the fruit business.
Meitfft. Webb and Carr died and Mr.
Littlefield sold out to Georgo W. Meade
and John I. Spear, and the firm name was
Spear, Meade it Co.
The firm moved from the old location
to Market street, in the Arizona block.
At different times alter that Dwight Fax
ton and Sidney Smith were included in
the firm of George W. Meade & Co. The
block on Drumm street known as the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 6, 1897.
Meade block was built by George W.
Meaae.
Money was made quite rapidly. Mr.
Meade had a handsome residence in this
City and also built up an expensive place
at Sausalito, which still reminds the
passer of his enterprise. He thrived until
he loaded up too heavily with California
projects. Then be was forced to the wail.
He had worked hard and his health was
undermined.
He had literally worked himself out, for
during this period he was concerned also
in Fresno raisin growing and was travel
ing indetatigably, trying 1o extend the
market. He went to Europe and tried to
recover his health, passing two years
abroad.
When he returned to California his
health was not restored but his energy re
mained the same. He went to Redlands
and engaged in real estate speculations
and other enterprises and bade fair to re
trieve his broken fortunes and to win
another. Once more, however, he was
loaded up too heavil}-, and dull times and
interest moneys were too much for him.
He died at Los Angeles Saturday last. He
leaves a widow and three surviving chil
dren. Two children died some years ago
and are buried in this city. Mr. Meade's
age was about 45.
STRUCK BY A STREETCAR.
Little Francis Mohr Was Run
Down and Injured on Bran
nan Street.
He Was Gathering Coal and Wood
for His Mother When the
Accident Occurred.
Francis Mohr, a nine-year-old lad, is a
sufferer at the Receiving Hospital. The
little fellow lives at 455 Bryant street,
where be is of great assistance to his
mother in gathering up wood and coal
along the wharves for use at home.
He was out plying his vocation yester
day morning about 10 o'clock on Brannan
street, when an electric-car running from
the Mail Dock to Third street strusk him.
Ho was rolled over and bruised to such an
extent that he had to be conveyed to the
Receiving Hospital for treatment.
Dr. Fitzgibbon found no broken bones,
but there are indications that the lad was
iniuaed internally.
No arrests have been made, and no ac
tion in that line will be taken unless the
child should die.
The electric-cars on Brannan street are
not provided with fenders.
GRAND JURY INDICTMENTS.
Federal Officers Take Cognizance of

A NEW PASTOR
TO A NEW PULPIT
The Third Swedenborgian
Church Society of
This City.
Rev. J. S. David, Called From
Portland, Has Come to
Lead It.
Meetings to Be Held in a Private
Residence Until Larger Quar
ters Are Provided.
Rev. J. S. David has just come here
from Portland, Or., as the accepted pasfor
ot the recently organized Third Sweden
borgian Church.
The new society wan established three
months ago, with a membership of thirty
followers of the teachings of Swedenborg.
It has been holding regular meetings at
the residence of Mrs. Louderback, at 837
Post street. It will continue to hold them
there for a while until the present nu
cleus of a larger congregation to come
shall have decided upon some hall or
other larger temporary place of worship,
pendine the ultimate erection of a church,
after the plan of the development of the
two older societies of the same church.
REV. /â¢ S. DAVID, Pastor of the New Third Swedenborgian
Church of This C:tyÂ«
Tho new pastor, the first one the new
church has had, was called here to under
take the work. He is accompanied by his
wife and little son.
Rev. Mr. David is a native of Nova Sco
tia, where he lived for the lirsttwenty-nye
years of his life. He is now forty-four
years of a^e. First he was a Wesleyan
Methodist preacher in Nova Scotia. After
leaving his native country he entered the
Convention Theological School of the new
chursh located at Boston. Subsequent to
beiiiE: graduated he took up the work of
the Swedenborgian Church in Maine and
preached in that State for two years. He
then preached for three years in Toronto,
Ont., for four years in Minneapolis, and
iatierly for three years in Portland.
Three years ago, just before his call to
Portland, he preached for a few months
in the First Swedenborcian Church, on
O'Farrell street, in this City.
In addition to his new church duties
here he proposes to travel over the State
as a so-called missionary preacher, and
will do such work particularly in the
towns about San Francisco bay. He hope 3
also to devote some of his time to occa
sional work in Oregon, where he was very
successful in spreading the pnncii les of
the new church and m organizing numer
ous reading societies for the furtherance of
the teachings of Swedenborg.
The first sermon of the new Third Swe
denborgian Church will be delivered next
Sunday evening at 857 Post street. Serv
ices will begin at 7:45 o'clock and will be
open to all.

BEANSTON WILL
MAKE A CONTEST
Two Secretaries in the
Board of Education
Rooms.
Charles Welch, the New Ap
pointee, Must Take Legal
Steps.
The Man Who Has Been Declared an
"Out" Says That He Is Still
an "Id."
Two men, both of whom claim posses
sion of the office of secretary of the Board
of Education, are holding forth in the
rooms of the board in the City Hall, and
it is certain that neither will give in until
the courts decide which is entitled to the
position and emoluments.
Charles Welch, who was appointed on
Monday to succeed George Beanston, the
incumbent for many years past, is in
possession of the outer office, where the
assistant secretaries do their â work, and
Mr. Beanston is for the present supreme
in the inner sanctum, where his records
and papers of the board are kept.
When Mr. Welch came in to demand
his office on Monday last there was still
some work to clean up from the meeting
at which his appointment was made. Mr.
Beanston asked that he be allowed to
keep his desk until everything was in
proper shape, and his request was acceded
to by Mr, Welch.
Yesterday Beanston had a consulta
tion with ins attorney and was advised
that Superintendent of Schools Babcock,
who ordered his retirement, had no legal
a uthority to take such a step, and he was
a dvised to retain his records and other
do cuments until forced to leave by force
or legal measures.
In the meantime Mr. Welch had quali
fied, and when he heard of Mr. Beanston'B
move, held a consultation with a number
of members of the new board, with Su
perintendent Babcock and finally with
Attorney Vogelsang, who is the new
board's legal adviser.
Both the board and Mr. Babcock ac
knowledged Mr. Welch as the secretary,
and the attorney advised him that his ap
pointment was perfectly legal. He made
another demand for his office, but was
met with a refusal, Mr. Beanston an
nouncing that he would keep possession
until ousted.
The employes of the office were some
what in a quandary as to what to do in
the mutter, the new appointees siding
with Mr. Welch, the others staying by
Mr. Beanston, who went on with bis work
as if nothing hud happened.
Mr. Welch is evidently under the im
pression that the man he desires to suc
ceed will walk out to-day, when a formal
proceeding in ejectment is taken.
In this he will be disappointed, as the
veteran secretary says that he will stay at
his post until removed by iorce or the
process of the court.
''Superintendent Babcock is a de facto
officer of tnls board," he said, "and as
such has exceeded his authority in au
nouncing my dismissal â at least, I am so
informed by competent legal authority.
'â¢The office of secretary of the Board of
Education is a statutory one, created by
the Legislature, and I am under bonds of
$3000 for the faithful performance of my
duty. I would think that I was hardly
doing the right thing by my bondsmen if
I went out without being certain that my
dismissal was legal. I shall pay no atten
tion to requests to vacate and will wait for
the other side to take action."
Superintendent Babcock says that he
had not the slightest intention of appoint
ing a successor to School Director Hal
stead in ense the latter was unable through
sickness tc qualify. He considers Mr.
Halstead a personal friend and would
have appointed him to the vacancy had
he failed to qualify on time.
In case of a fatal termination of Mr.
Halstead's illness the duty of appointing
his successor will devolve on the Superin
tendent.
HE DIED IN THE VAN.
A Lottery Ticket Feddler Expire* While
On His Way to the Receiving
Hospital.
Asthma claimed another victim yester
day morning. John W. White, a colored
man 60 years of age, wno made his living
by selling lottery tickets, was arrested
Monday night while he was plying nis
trade, and after a few hours' sojourn in
the dark damp cells of the Southern Po
lice station he was conveyed to better
office at the main quarters.
Captain Robinson noticed that White
was ill and ordered him transferred to the
Receiving Hospital. On the way. in the
ambulance, White expired. The body was
removed to the Morgue.
Five in a Bed and a Growler.
Officer McMurray of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children found the
family of Joseph Marks in a pitiable condition
at the Brunswick House, at 148 Sixth street,
Monday night. The mother ana four children
were crowded into a three-quarter bed. Joseph
Marks was in the same room, the only oiie
occupied by the family, and he was absorbed
largely in the charms presented by a partially
filled "prowier" of beer. Unless he does better
he will be arrested for cruelty to his children,
of whom the oldest is 9 years old and the
youngest 2 years.

NOETH BEACH TRAGEDY.
Considerable Interest in the Trial of
Brittan for Killing Keilley.
North Beach was well represented in
Judge Wallace's court yesterday for the
purpose of hearing the trial of William
H. Brittan, who stands charged with mur
der for the killing of Philip A. Reiily on
October 21 of last year.
Brittan admits the killing, but declares
that he acted in self-defense and to save
his own life.
Brittau, the defendant, told his story of
the killing. He said that on the day of
the trouble he started to go into a saloon
on Bay street, at the corner of Powell,
when he was met by Reilley, who knocked
him down, jumped'on him' and thumped
his head up and down on the pavement.
While that was going on, he said, James
Cunningham came up and kicked him in
Hie face, cutting him badly and knocking
out his teeth; that Cunnineham said he
would cut the heart out of any one who
interfered.
"What did you do?" asked Attorney
Devoto.
"I asked Reilley to let me up, and said
I wouldn't light any more. He let me up
and 1 staggered toward the sidewalk*.
Then I saw him coming toward me again,
and I heard him say that lie intended 10
'dom e. I was dazed, and thought that
r.y lile was in danger, sol drew my pis
tol and tired. When I looked around
again I was alone. Tnen 1 went and
washed my face the best 1 could, for I was
bleeding from the nose and mouth. Boon
aiterward I was arresled. I was in poor
healiu at the time, under the care of a
doctor for lung trouble, and am in the
tame condition yet. Reilley was a big.
powerful man. I iliu not seek trouble
with him, and did not expect it. If I had
known be was ibere I would not have
gone where he was."
John T. Keane corroborated Brittan,
and said Reilley was a big man and
stronger than Brittan.
Keane said his impression was that
when Reilley let Brittan up it wan with
the expectation that the tight was to go
on.
James Cunningham was the strongest
witness against the defendant. He admit
ted that he wns o friend of Reilley, and
that he kicked Brittan in the face after he
was down and Reiiley was on ton of him.
He said that the fatal shot was fired after
the iijjht was all over and when Reilley
was not making any threatening demon
stration.
Tue case will be argued this morning,
arid will be submitted to the jury this
afternoon.

STILL HAMPERED BY DEBT
Reports Made b7 the Chiefs o:
the Various Y. M. C. A.
Branches.
Remarkable Showing by the Financial
Management Tbat May Soon Clear
tbe Institution
The forty-fourth annual meeting of the
San Francisco Young Men's Christian
Association was held with a very large at
tendance at the association building.
Mason and Ellis streets, Monday evening.
It was called to order at 8 o'clock by Vice-
President R. V. Watt, who presided dur
ing the session.
J. J. Valentine was unanimously re
elected president of the association, and
R. V. Watt and C. 8. Wright were elected
to serve with him as vice-presidents.
Samuel Foster was re-elected treasurer.
C. A. Maydwell recording secretary and
B. C. Wright auditor.
M. S. Woodhams, chairman of the nom
inating committee, made im report, and
Major W. B. Hooper and John F. Merrill
were elected members of the board of
trustees, and Messrs. 1. J. Truman, Wal
lace Bradford, N. P. Cole. C. S. Wright, J.
S. Webster and Dr. E. E. Kelly were ap
pointed on the board of director?, which is
the managing body of the institution, the
trustees being the custodians of all prop
erty owned by the association.
Reports were presented from the various
brancnes of the great institution, includ
ing the religious, physical, moral, social,
educational, l>oys. etc., all of which showed
that most commendable work had been
accomplished during the year.
Toe most remarkable feature of the
year's work was the financial attainment.
One hundred thousand dollars has been
subscribed by interested friends to the
building fund of the association, $98,000 of
which has been received and paid on ac
count of the indebtedness
The report of Mr. Foster, the treasurer,
showed that the income from the portions
of the buiJding rented and from niember
: ship fees had provided for the actual mn-
I nir.g expenses 'of the association. When
| the incubus of debt is removed ihe insti
i union will be .in splendid condition. To
bring the actual running expenses within
the income irom memberships ana rentals
j the association has been obliged to rent a
great deal of the building that ought to be
used for purposes of the association and to
curtail the work In every direction on ac
count of the burden of debt that still rests
} upon the institution. But the cancellation
of the balance of the debt will practically
be an endowment for the work.
Committees were appointed for the pur
pose of arranging for a reception to'
mechanics at the association building in
the near futute, and also lor a reception
I for clerks and salesmen.
The o.d property of the association on
Sinter street is now rented for a sufficient
amount to provide for the interest on the
mortgage on that property, and it may be
taken out of the market until really im
proves.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 6, 1897.
SATIN SUPPERS
TOLD THEIR BLISS
Nuptials of Miss Helen
Schweitzer and Samuel
Stiefel.
Dr. Voorsanger Speaks the
Words That Make the
Couple One.
Union of Two Families Prominent in
Social Circles and the Com
mercial World.
Miss Helen Schweitzer, youngest daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. B. Schweitzer, and
Samuel Stiefel, a prominent New York
merchant, were married yesterday at noon
at the residence) of the bride's parents,
corner of Post and Leaven worth streets.
It was one of the most elegant weddings
of the season, and nothing that taste could
suegest or wealth provide was neglected.
The entire lower floor of the spacious
home was placed at the disposal of the
guests. Early on Monday morning Miss
Bates and her corps of assistants took
possession of the home, anil wilh the aid
of choice blossoms, palms, ferns and the
many other accessories used for decorative
purposes, made the home look like an en
chanted palace. In toe corridor the
decorations wera arranged according to the
bride's desire, and the effect was fcimilar to
that used at the wedding of Miss Cora
Schweitzer and Marcus Koshland live
years ago.
Palms concealed the wall nnd met over
head. Lone stemmed cala lillies bloomed
on all sides an 1 poised high in the air
were countiess white dovas, supporting in j
their beaks festoons of airy tulle. In the
drawing-room where tne ceremony was
performed an altar drap?d in phik and
white embroidered silk: was improvised.
Overhead bung baskets of roses and carna
tions, white, pale pink and deep carmine.
Hundreds of pink tapers bid in the sur
rounding greenery ehed a soft light on the
beauinul &cene.
Standing at the altar in the midst of all
the floral beauty Rev. Dr. VoorÃanger read
the impressive Jewish service which mmk
the happy young couple one.
The bride, who is dainty and petite, wore
a briduJ gown of white satin comp.etely
shrouded in an overJress of white tulle.
Tne gown was destitute of all ornament.
The veil was fastened to the coiffura with
a wreatu of oranse blossoms. Tne bride
was attendpd by Miss Clara Joseph, maid
of honor, and Miss Cora Miller, Miss Agnes
Brandenstein, Miss Alice (Jreenebaum and
MissÃdle Jierbtle.
Joseph Silverberg was best man and
Monroe Schweitzer, Henry Sacns, Leon
Greenebaum, Sig Baumr.n, Manfred
Brandenstein and Jesse Triest the ushers.
Florence and Edit â  Guggenheim were
tne little flower-girls who gracefully
strewed lragrant blossoms along the path
to the uhnr.
The bridesmaids were attired alike in
pink gowns. The skirts were of pink
MR. AND MRS. SAMUEL STIEFEL (nee Schweitzer).
moire velours and the waists of the same
materinl were covered with white net.
They wore large black velvet Gainsborough
hats.
Miss Joseph, the maid of honor, wore
a dainty gown of white mous.-eline over
white silk and a hat similar to tho3e worn
by the bridesmaids.
After the ceremony an elaborate break
fast was partaken of. The tables were set
in a tent that had been erected on the
lawn at the side of the house.
Ttie presents were costiy and elegant.
Mr. and Mrs. Stiefel left last evening
for a short bridal trip.
Amid a copious shower of rice the newly
wedded couple daned into their carriage,
blissfully unconscious of the fact that the
vehicle was tied with long white satin
streamers and that from the spokes of the
wheels daneled dainty wbite satin slip
pers. Crowds followed the gay- equipage
tor blocks vainly trying to get a glimpse
of the newly wedde<l pair within.
Mr. and Mrs. Stiefel will return for a
short stay in town previous to their de
parture for their future home in New York.
IN THE HOLY LAND.
Key. Haikett- Smith Gives an Instruc
tive I>cture.
The first of three Oriental entertain
ments wasdelivered Monday night by Rev.
Haskett-Simth in the auditorium of the
Youne Men's Christian Association build
ing, to a very appreciative but not as largo
an audience as the event merited.
The entertainment was a conversational
description of a trip from Joppa to Jeri
cho, illustrated with many very line stere
opticon pictures from photographs taken
by the reverend gentleman and colored to
heighten their effect. Mr. Smith is a
fluent talker, uses excellent language and
has a descriptive power that is delightful
and fascinates his audience.
He described a trip in ths Holy Land
in the company of a nervous minister and
eight old maids and by pictures and words
told of the landing Â«t Joppa nnd of the
rock to which Andromeda was chained,
aiid said that the guides will try to con
vince the skeptics that the chaining of the
ruler's dau-bter was true by showing an
old iron ring in tlie rock. He said that
while tnere is mucli to be seen that is con
nected with Biblical history he frit bound
"in the interest ot truth, to say that nine
tenths of the so-called "sacred sights"
shown by the dragoman are all bosh.
He then took his hearers through vari
ous parts of the country outside of the
city of Jerusalem, which he promised
would be the subject of the entertainment
to be given to-night, and told of the sights
to be seen and the customs of the people.
WILL PAY WARRANTS.
The Usual Hold- Ip by the Auditor
Will lie Omitted.
As the result of a warning given the
chairmen of the various committees of the
Board of Supervisors by Auditor Broder
icu, the usup! wholesale hold-up of war
rants will not take placo this year. As a
general thing toward the end of the year
the funds are in a dapleted condition and
the Auditor is compelled to pigeonhole a
large number of warrants to prevent over
drawing. As the danger appeared to be
approaching several weeks ago, the Audi
tor called the attention of the Supervisors
to the matter and asked them to bo care
ful.
On the last day of its official life tha
board sent down a number of warrants
tliat the Auditor feared would overdraw
the funds and he held them up until he
could ascertain the exact condition of the
funds. A computation showed them to
be in good condition and few overdrafts
developed.
Tne registration and election expenses
ran over i lie appropriation to the extent
of $12, 601 81, but tne warrants wiil not be
held up as the Supreme Court has decided
that such demands must be paid under ail
circumstances.
In the health department funds, the
jaiis and prison and hospital expense ap
propriations are slightly overdrawn and
t tie warrants will have to'wait a few weeKs.
The Police Patrol is in the same condition,
but none of the overdrafts are heavy.

TO INSIST ON
CLEAN SCHOOLS
Grand Jury Wants to Hear
From the Board of
Education.
Members Have Been Making an
Independent Investigation
of Buildings.
They Find That the Complaint of the
Board of Health Was Well
Founded.
It can be said of the new Grand Jury
that it is wasting no time. It has already
begun active work looking to the re
habilitation of the public school buildings
with regard to their proper sanitation.
The jury will summon the members of
the Board of Education before it at its
meeting next Friday to learn from them
the limitations or possibilities in the situ
ation from their standpoint. Members of
the jury have already consulted Kith
members of the Board of Health, but tbc
latter declare they have been shown to be
powerless to more than point out the
necessity of reform.
At the meeting of the jury a week ago
Foreman Peixotto appointed every mem
ber a committee or one to inquire into the
condition of the sciiool or scuools nearest
his home.
At tho semi-weekly meeting of the
jury held yesterday these eighteen sev
eral committees reported, aud the col
lective reports present a sad picture of the
public schools of this City. The Hearst
School is reported as leading all the rest
in the matter of unhealthy conditions, un
sanitary plumbing and bad drainage.
The jury promises to do all that it can
to bring about a reform in this important
matter.

2^*^PLEA FOR CHRISTIAN SOCIALISM.
Rev. D V P. B* Bliss, Church Lecturer and Sociologist, Tells of His
Reform Mission in the Golden West
Key. \V. D. P. Bliss o! Boston, official
lecturer for the Church Social Union, edi
tor of the famous Fabian essays and au
thor of "An Encyclo?>edia of Social Re
form," is just now making a tour of Cali
fornia ana the West for the purpose of
educating the higher classes to the view of
altruism as against tha present system of
etroism and bilter personal conflict in
matters commercial.
"Mypurposes are in part," said the em
inent author and lecturer yesterday, "to
arouse the intellectual and moral classes,
particularly in the church, to the impor
tarice of the great economic and social
problems now knocking loudly for an
swer. The Church Social Union by no
means indorses all my views, for I am a
socialist, but its purposes are such as
make for better conditions."
The Church Social Union, of which Mr.
Bliss was the organizer and first secretary.
expresses its objects in the following para
graph from one of its principal tracts:
Objectsâ l. To claim for the Christian law
the ultimate authority to rule social practice.
2. To study in common how toaup.y tne moral
truths and principles of Christianity to the
social and economic difficulties of the present
time. 3. To present Christ in practical life as
the living master and ting, the enemy of
wrong ana selfishness, tne power of righteous
ness and love.
The members of the executive commit
tee are mostly eminent clergymen of Bos
ton, the following being in the executive
committee and council:
Rev. J. W. tfuter (chairman); Professor \V. .T.
Ashley, M.A.; Edmund Billings, Rev.W. D. P.

Rev. H. H. Sleeper, Pn.D; Rev. William Har
xnan Van Allen; Rev. Gtorse R. Van de Water,
D.D. ; Everett P. Wheeler, Key. John Williams,
George Zabriskie.
Mr. Bliss is practically traveling as sec
retary far the Social Union. His immedi
ate work in this vicinity will be to teach
his views to the people. To-nigat he will
speak to the socialists at their Turk-street
Temple; to-morrow night at St. Mark's
Church, Berkeley; .Friday afternoon at
Stanford University: thence to San Mateo,
Sacramento and Eastward. He will speak
to the Young Men's Chnstiin Association
here on Sunday afternoon and at Pythian
Castle at night.
The following excerpts from the reform
er's latest tracts give an ;dea, of his
views. He expects no immediate reform?,
purposes to establish no schools or insti
tutions, but believes better times are to
come from the general education and up
lifting of the masses. He says:
Christian Socialism, founded nearly fifty
years ago in England by Frederick D. Maurice,
Charles Kingsiey and others, accents the econ
omic doctrine and aim of socialism, but finds
a basis therefor in the life and teachings of
Jesns Christ. This scnool of socialism has
found a very wide acceptance. Says Professor
Kirkup. in "his article on socialism, in the En
cyclopaedia Britannica: '-The ethics of social
ism are closely akin to the ethics of Chns:i
anity. if not identical with them." Says
Professor do Lnveleye ("Introduction "to
Socialism of To-day): "Every Chris
. tian who understands and earnestly accepts
the teachings of his Master is at heart a so
cialist, and every socialist, whatever may be
his b&tred against all religion, bears witbin
himself an unconscious Cbri>uan:ty." Iho
early Christian Socialists went so far as tocall
socialism the nineteenth century livery of
Cnristianitr. | It perhaps should be stated
that it is only in England and America that
the Christian Socialists accept the ful econ
omic doctrines and aim of socialism. On the
continent of Europe Christian Socialism,
Roman Catholic and Protestant alike, means
little more thun the expansion of the State in
THEY ALL WANT
BOXING LEGALIZED
Sporting Men Draft a Bill
for the Legisla
ture.
A Limit of Twenty Rounds
Added to the Horton Bill
Proviso.
It Is Thonght a Mcnstjr Petition Can
Bj Had for the Adoption
of the B . 1!.
A called meeting of sportsmen was held
in Myrtle Hall of the Alcazar building,
on O'Farretl street, last evening for the
purpose of draftine a bill to be submitted
to the present Legislature, legitJuziog
boxing contests as distinguished from
prize-fights.
Lewis H. Scharer acted as chairman and
William E. D'Aiey as secretary. After
some discussion it was decided that the
bill to be submitted should be the present
law as printed in the statutes, with the
addition of the following proviso:
Provided, however, that sparring exhibi
tions no; to exeeod twenty rounÂ«ls, with gloves
of .not less ttinn five ounces each in weight,
may be held by a domestic, incorporated
athletic association in a building leased by it
for athletic purposes only for one year, or in a
building owned by such association.
This is an exact copy of the Horton bill
governing contests in the State of New
York, with the exception that it contains
a twenty-round limit not mentioned in
the Horton bill.
It was decided that the secretary be ap
pointed a committee of one to present the
bill to a lawyer and see if it contain any
provision that would interfere with ita
adoption.
[l was stated by the secretary that
Senator Eugene F. Bert has volunteered
to carry the bill to Sacramento and pre
sent it at the proper time.
Another meeting will be held Friday
evening.
A petition for the adoption of the bill
will be actively circulated after the next
meeting by the various athletic organiza
tions of tne State. The belief prevails
that over 1000 signatures of influential
residents can be secured in this City alone.
MECHANICS' INSTITUTE.
V Trustees Meet, Vote to Have a Fair and
Nominate a Ticket.
The trustees of the Mechanics' Iqsti
tute met last evening and received a Jist
of nominations for the board of trustees to
be elected Tuesday, February 23. The
ticket contains the following names: R.
P. Clement, E. H. Colo, ErnÂ»t A. Denicke,
Frank T. Doolan, Ferdinand Formhals,
paternal care of the poor under the influence i
.of Christian charity. State Charity is not
socialism.
It is, therefore, a part of the programme
of th lecturer to teach people the differ
ence between philosophic socialism and;
â  I State charity. He has surveyed the field
â  ' until he believes socialism is coming, if
' not in this generation, partly so. He ran
' for Lientenant-Governor of Massachusetts
on the Labor party, tickpt some years ago,
yet he does not indorse half the propa- I
I ganda they subscribe to and have faith in.
Speaking of the growth of the doctrine
i of collectivism yesterday, Mr. Bliss said:
I Socialism is coming. In Germany the so
'caiisivoieis 1,800,000; in France it ts at
i least 900,000; iv Belgium, Austria. Switzer
land a. id Italy it is the growing party. In
I England socialism has not cast a large direct
â  vote, simply because it has so largely entered
| all parties. In the United States it is present
! in the South and West in the 1,500,000 votes
I of the People's party and in the .Last in the
I growing Socialist Labor party, and still more
I in the growing sentiment of many who are not
connected with any socialist party. New Zea
land, me * most progressive -country of the
world, is almost a socialist commonwealth.
Socialism is spreading to-day, in factory and
in university, in churcii and in State, in hu
man ideais and in practical politics. Even
j Spencer, who, through mistaking its nature,
considers socialism slavery, cal.s it "the com
ing slavery."
While thus believing in its power and
foretelling its coming, Mr. Bliss does not
think government ought to force it. He
says:
The first thing that socialists aim to do is to
convert otner people to socialism. Socialism
must spring from the people. Government
will not, can not and should not attempt to
force socialistic measures on the community.
You cannot have socialism until you have |
socialists. Thereiore, as Kobert Biatchford |
says, "the first thing to do to spread tocialism j
! is "to make socialists." But as socialists gain ,
; influence how would they strive to introduce
' their ideas? In many ways. There is no one i
programme for all'countries and all places.
! There is no royal road to Ireedom. Eacu ooin
j munity must study its own needs and its own
' circumstances.
Yet there are certain measures that socialists j
everywhere immediately strive for. They
strive to make government democratic. To
j day in America we do not have popular gov
! ernment, but machine government. Who
rules in NeW York' Cityâthe people or the
corporations and their tools, the politicians?
Who rules in Congressâthe people or the j
monopolies and trusts'? Therefore socialists !
favor proportional representation, the initia- i
tive and the referendum. When laws are
referred to the people legislators cannot
readiiy sell legislation.
The secretary of the Church Union
speaks boldly aDout what he thinks ought !
to be done under the new regime. He
says:
But when trovernment has been made demo- j
cratlc what shouid the State do? There are j
three lines of reform that must be loilowed
more or less simultaneous.y, reiorms concern
ing land, capital and labor. These are the
three factors which enter into all production, j
and no one of which can be ignored. We need |
land reform. Eighty per cent of the popula
tion of New York City live in tenements, while j
only 35 per cent of ail the families of the
! United States own their home free from debt.
Many socialists would commence meeting this
evil, "by taxing the laud neld lor speculation as
fully as land in use and by gradually raising
the taxation' on all land values (including
mines and all natural opportunities). Â«Tnus
they would gradually absorb the value of all
land for the people.
In a recent tract entitled "What Social
ism Is," Mr. Bliss says:
But socialists would not do this alone. They
â¢would gradually develop the municipal and
National ownerscip and operation of capital
in industry, substituting this for industry
rued by great private corporations and mo
nopolies. The Nation snould own and ope
rate the raiiro-ids, the teleeraph. etc | Many
nations aiready do this. Everywhere it is
| successful. We" must own them in the United
I Sta:es, or the railroads will wholly own us, as
they partly do to-day.
After treating as nerein indicated on
general questions, the author says of the
Christian Socialist programme:
It would aid the eight-tiour movement. It
would reduce the hours, of labor Iv factory
1 and in shop, that mea may have longer hours

teaching the people self-government. It
would emancipate woman as well as man. It
does not believe in a democracy of half the
people. It would develop a true municipal
ism, as is being done in Birmingham, Glas
gow, London, Benin and other litien.
Glasgow, by spending $7,000,000 in tearing
down and rebuilding the worst tenements,
and by municiimlly clearing courts and pas
sages, by providing municipal baths, wash
houses, etc., has reduced her death rate from
fifty-four to twenty-nine per thousand. This
Christian Socialism considers practical Chris
tianity. It would nave tne city employ the
unemployed, in ways not to compete with
present labor. Says Turgot, whom Matthew
Arnold calls "the wisest statesman France
ever had": "God, when he made man with
warHs and rendered labor an indispensable
resource, made the right of work the property
of every individual; and this property is the
first, the most sucred, and the most impre
scriptible of all kinds of property." It would
have cities obtain the funds for doing this by
conducting gas works, surface railroads, etc.,
for a profit for the city, instead of having
them owned by rich capitalists favored by
city iranchises.
Christian Socialists would have the nations
own and manage railroads, the telegraph, ex
pressage, etc., etc In every way it would re
place competition by fraternal combination,
and it would press toward reform in all these
ways. It is not one reform. It is many re
forms on one principle. Perhaps most impor
tant of ail is land reform. Chns'ian Socialism
would revert to the old Bible principle, that
God is the owner of ail the earth, and men
only entitled to its use. It would, therefore,
favor the reclaiming of the land for the use of
! all tLe people by taxing land values on a grad
| uated scale, and increasingly every lew years,
I till finally the whole value of the natural re
i sources of the earth be taken for the people
! and not for the classes.
The traveling secretary is trying every
j where to impress upon men tiie necessity
of recognizing Christ as a leader. He says:
We come now to ask definitely what men are
to do.
To recognize Christ's headship and kingship
I over all life. This is the first thing man needs
to do. It brings society together. It gives a |
head, an expressed unity, to the otherwise un
realized and inchoate unity of mankind.
Without Cnrist men fa.l. Socialists are not
social. They grow confusing and confused.
| They strive to build a tower as high a heaven
i and produce only a Babel âa confusion of
| tongues. They have lost their leeder; Christ
is the leader. He brings all into one body. He
is the atonement, the at-one-ment oi man with
man, as truly as of man with God. If his body
seems to-dity divided, if the church is riveu by
schism, it is not oucause men have followed
( Christ, but because they have refused to fol
low him. He is the way to unity.
If this seems at first undemocratic it is soon
seen that it is the very perfection of democ
racy, which is the rule of all the people.
I When ail in freedom choose Christ, we all
realize our oneness with him, even as he is
one with God. Our will is love, and love is
tne will of all. It is the only way we can all
j ruie. Christ is no tyrant; he Is the elder
I brother.
A body must have a head if it stand high in
1 the scale of evolution; if univeisul society,
therefore, be a body or should be a body, as
the scriptures and socialists both teach, it
must have a head. But that head must be
eternal. Science and religion are both teach
ing to-day that deaih does not end ali. Hu
manity sfiall become spirit, transformed into
spirit life, a spiritual whole. Its head must
then be both spiritual and visible.
Christian Socialists hold Christ to ba that
head. The lactthat all men are to-day being j
drawn together in Christ shows him to be the j
uniter. li is not strange that, as a matter of j
fact, all men claim Christ. They all claim him
because he belongs to all. Christians of all
kuids claim him. The Jews say he was a Jew.
The theosophists claim him for their thoughts,
the socialists lor theirs, the individualists for
theirs, the anarchists for theirs. He is the
worid-man. Sectarian Christianity may tiave
made him a sectarian Christ, but, truly under
stood, lie fulfills Brahmniism, Buddhism, Mo
hainmt-danismâall religious thoughts, because
he is not sectarian.
It Is to teach these views, among other
things, that the reverend gentleman is
making a tour of the United States, carry
ing on meanwhile his raultifarious duties
as editor of encycloj sedias and books on
social topics.

the Olympic athletic part for a term and
will give several athletic meetings during
the summer season. Melntyre haa several

anything and that he will meet him at
any time and place in a contest of four,
six or ten rounds.
As the game of fisticuffs is now at low

MINIM AT GOLD OBEES.
H. J. May-ham and Associates Investing
$400, 000 in Quartz and Placer
Properties.
H. J. Mayham, a wealthy resident of
Denver, who owns large interests in im
portant properties at Gold Creek, Nev.,
seventy miles north of Elko and about
twelve miles south of the Idaho line, is
among the arrivals at the Palace. He is
accompanied by Colonel H. 8. Moxson,
the engineer, of Nevada, who has been for
some time with him at Gold Creek.
Mr. Mayham reports that there is con
sideraoie activity at Gold Creek. Un
usual interest has been caused lately in
the various gold ledgos there. A camp
has sprung up of several hundred people
and a weekly paper called the Gold Creek
News has just been started.
"The property in which I am inter
ested," said Mr. Mayham, "consists of
something over 1000 acrea of placer ground
and about fifty quartz veins. We are
working about 200 teams and 300 men,
and are patting in, in all the camp, about
$â 400,000. We are constructing a big reser
voir, mining buildings, a hotel, store and
extensive ditches.
"I am satisfied the country about there
is very rich. We already have gold de
veloped in both the placer and quartz
properties. It is the placer, however, that
is lalcine our attention at present."
With Mr. mayham is J. Tredwell Rich
ards, a prominent attorney of New York,
who is largely interested in the mine.
Major J. L. Robertson of New York is
uresident of the company.
Mr. Mayham and Mr. Richards will
leave for the East probably to-day. They
have been in Nevada for several weeks.
GLEASON UNDER ARREST.
The Horse-Breaker Is Charged
With Cruelty to Ani
mals.
Secretary Holbrcok Steps the Per
formanca at the People's
Palace
Professor 0. R. Gleason was arrested
last night by Secretary Holbrook of tbe
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, for cruelty to one of the horses
he was breaking in at the People's Palace.
Secretary Holbrook has been attending
the nightly performances and has been
watching closely for any evidence of
cruelty to the horses, but it was not till
last night that he considered it his duty
to interfere, though nearly everybody
in the atuiience seemed to be against him,
judgin . by the shouting headed by Major
Fahey of the Cosmopolitan Hotel.
The horse was a bay one and belonged
to George Schweitzer, who brought it f re 31
Alameda County. It had received a
wound on the front part of one of its hind
legs, which had healed up, leaving a scar.
After the animal, which Gieason claimed
was a vicious brute, had been put through
various breaking-in movements, Gieason
ordered his assistants to hit^n the horteto
a wagon. Holbrook protest^ and Gieason
insisted, and tne upshot was that Hol
brook placed the professor under arrest.
At this juncture Major Fabey offered
bonds, and cueer after cheer rent the air.
But for the interference of Gleasou Hol
brook would have been assaulted.
Gieason announced to the audience that
he had been arrested, but that he would
bring the h> rse on again to-ni^ht, and if
prevented by Holbrook it would be the
last time he would perform in this City.
There were loud cries of "Put him out!"
from the audience aimed at Holbrook, but
he stood his ground, and Gieason quietly
walked away with him.
Pahey and others offered bail, and
there were many cries of, "This is a grand
stand play of Holbrook !" and "Why
doesn't he look after overworked horses?"
Gieason said in the City Prison that he
would make thi3 a test case, as he denied
that he had ever shown any cruelty to a
horse by hia system of breaking-in, and
he would bring competent witnesses to
prove that no cruelty wa3 shown to the
horse last night.
Holbrook, on the other hand, said the
horse had been cruelly treated. He de
nied that it was a vicious animal, and said
it wa3 tortured for about three-quarters of
an hour, until it was thoroughly ex
hausted. That was the limit of his com
plaint.
The professor was no sooner booked at
the City Prison than Cliff Phillips drove
up in a hack, accompanied by Ned
Foster and Mike Smith, a saloon-keeper,
and presented an order mr his release on
his own recognizance. After some objec
tion to the oriier on the part of Holbrook
on the score ot an informality, Gieason
was released.
Major Fahey spoke very plainly about
the matter last night, sJfln*:: "it was a
spectacular play by Holbrook. Gleason
was in no way cruel and I can pruve it by
a hundred men. He was supersensitive
and altogether wrong, but I suppose he
felt that he had a duty 10 perform."
JUDGE OONLAN'S BAILIFF.
Efforts Being Made to Uqt Kid of That

Judge Conlan has declined to accept
Thomas Wilson, a Superior Court janitor,

George Kelly has been bailiff of the court
for the past four years, and the Judge and
others bear testimony to hia trustworthi
ness and efficiency, and the probability is
that he will be continued in office for the
next two years.
"I shall not accept any man," said the
Judge yesterday, "unless his qualifications
are satisfactory. I have found Bailiff
Kelly a faithful, efficient and trustworthy
officer, and I see no reason why he should
not be reappointed. 1 have no desire to
place myself in antagonism to the com
mittee, but I want a man as bailiff in

CAN THE GENERAL
SUE AN OFFICER?
What the Commander of
the National Guard
Wants to Know.
Report Concerning Lieutenant
Douglas of the Naval
Battalion.
It Hes Been Placed in the Hands of
the District Attorney for
Grand Jury Use.
The report of the Military Commission
appointed by General James to inquire
into the financial condition of the Naval
Battalion and other companies of the
National Guard was laid before District
Attorney Barnes yesterday and by him
presented to the Grand Jury. The ques
tion to which General James requires an
answer is as to his right or the rigkt of
any military authority to brine suit
before the courts for moneys taken or
other irregularities by officers of the
guard.
The report indicates a rather deplorable
condition in several of the organizations
of the National Guard, which it is the
purpose of General James to correct.
The committee referred to consisted of
Charies L. Tiiden, major. First Infantry;
D. A. Smith, captain, Fifth Infantry, Sec
ond Brigade, and H. B. Underbill, lieu
tenant of the Naval Battalion. They
were to inquire and report upon the finan
cial condition of the First Division, Naval
Battalion.
Lieutenant C. A. Douglas, late com
mander of the division, did not respond
to the summons to appear and testily be
fore the commission. The accounts of
the lieutenant were found to be. as tne
report says, in a most deplorable state,
indicating a looseness in the management
of the division's financial affairs that was
disgraceful. From March 20, 1893, to
April 14, 1896, tne books showed a cash
balance in the officer's hands of $3M 60,
but no accounting had been given of the
sum. Vouchers for several sums, aggre
gating $151, were found, showing or indi
cating that the battalion armorer, J. F.
Farrei!, had been paid the amount.
The vouchers bear Farrell's name, but
he declared under oath that he had not
received the money.
The committee also found bill 3 to tbe
amount oi $525 30 oi long standing on ac
couat of winch no money had been paid.
Among the creditors there are H. S.
Crocker & Co., the West Coast Furniture
Company, Upton Bros., Captain L. Siebe,
H. Peterson, a boatman, and J. F. Murphy
ana J. F. Farreil, armorers. In audition
to these an independent bill for $133 85
was also found for lumber long since
utilized.
A shortage in the arms, clothing and
accouterments of the division was also
reported.
Lieutenant-Commander Turner had for
a long time tried to compel Douglass to
make a satisfactory statement of property
and money, but without avail. Douglass
finally resigned, and since then the affairs
of tbe division have been straightened out
in everything but the oid debts contracted
while Douglass was in command.
General James expresses himself as de
termined to fix the responsibility for
whatever delinquencies may be discovered
of this character throughout the State
Guard, and where possible for him to do
so he will prosecute.
A FOUNDRY AT COGSWELL
The College Soon to Give Free
Instructions in Iron-
Molding.
Electric Power to Be Obtained and
Machine-Shops to Bj Put in
Operation.
The Cogswell Polytechnic College is
very soon to furnish free instruction in
ironmolding.
Men are now at work putting in an ex
tensive plant, which will be completed
and ready for use a month hence. Exca
vations for the molds are being made in
the roomy basement of the large work
shops at the rear of the main college
building. The basement walls of brick
have been cut through for windows and
doors, and a large opening has been made
for the connection between the molding
room and the furnaces in which the iron
will be melted.
A cupola, or large retort, is being built
just without the building. In it the
scraps of iron will be thrown and reduced
to a liquid state by the intense heat from
the furnace.
In addition to the establishment of this
new department of manual training the
long unused machine-shops are 10 be
started up in a large room directly over
the foundry.
Electric power is to be introduced for
the operation of the lathes and other
machines, the college having practically
concluded satisfactory arrangements
whereby power ma> be obtained either

any one who has satisfactorily completed

it is thought likely that most of the boys

other normal courses.

PANHANDLE CLUB.
Dr. Salfleld Means to Have Pure Water
and No Pesthouse.
The Panhandle Improvement Club held
a brief session last night at Columbia Hail
on Page slreet.
Dr. C. D. Salfield, the president, waa
there, as was also Secretary A.. L. Head,
the newly instaiied School Director, with
Vice-President O'Leary temporarily in the
chair.
President Sal field spoke earnestly on the
su bject of the Pesthouse, declaring that if
the objectionable building -should be lo
cated on the proposed s-ite be would start
a water company of his own, and guaran
teed to run it successfully in spite of the
opposition of the Spring Valley Water
Company.
He stated that he had sufficient guaran
tee from the majority of the property
owners in the district to patronize the
proposed scheme, and that he had found
both the water and the site for a reservoir
whence all could be supplied, as already
published in The Call of last Saturday.
In addition to this he read a long and
strong letter which he had written to
Governor Budd on the subject, urging on
that official the fairness of making a State
institution of the Pesthouse instead of sad
dling the expense of keeping the unfortu
nates of all nations who came to this City.

WILL DISCUSS INDIANS
Tho Century Club Preparing to
Hold an "Indian
Evening."
Hiss Ina Coolbritb and Mrs. Grace
Hudson Will Speak About
the Red Men.
The Century Club is going to have
something new one of these evenings,
something entirely "otherwise" ?.n the
nature of entertainments. "A Night With
Tennyson" may be all very well in its
way, but tne club has planned an enter
tainment in comparison with which con
ventional things may seem dull. It is to
have an "Indian Evening."
No doubt the novelty will be interesting
to the cultured society that will gather at
the Century Club's elegant house on Sut
tcr street, and, by the way, it has fallen to
the ladies of this social organization to
demonstrate how much there is in the
California Indian to claim attention ol j
artists and thinkers. The evening prom
ises to be all that is anticipated, and the
ladies say it will certainly open a new field
for advanced literary and artistic societies
in this City, though of course only the
subject itself as a source oi intellectual
pleasure is considered by the club.
The rooms of the club will be decorated
exclusively with Indian objects â baskets,
trinkets, curios and pictures of Indian
subiects. Loca-1 artists have contributed
sketches and pictures. Henry Raschen,
who talks the Indian dialect of Sonoma
and who has studied the natives in that
vicinity from his boybood, has loaned
paintings made by him on the coast
rancherias â sketches of Sonoma Indians'
Habitations illustrating their home life,
and portraits of typical faces. Mrs. Grace
Hudson has sent sketches of TJkiah In
dians, and her husband, Dr. Hudson, who
is credited with owning the best collec.
tion of Indian baskets, contributes from
his rich store baskets, the secret of weav
ing which is lost. Hanging the pictures
and arranging the baskets and other
things began yesterday.
The Indian evening is to be held to
morrow night. Mi*s Ina D. Coolbrith will
deliver a lecture on the "Indian of Ro
mance," Mrs. Grace Hudson will tell an
interesting story about the TJtiah Indians,
and Dr. Hudson will speak on matters of
ethnological value. Everything in this
event will pertain to Indian life.
Funeral of George Haas.

word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and

refers to low pressure, aud Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington |
ccast. When the pressure is high in the interior !
onti low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north aud south ulone the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low- Is inclosed with isobars of

the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expectPd in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

from Washington that the Senate had nut taken
up the Cameron Cuban resolution and t hat there
was no prospect of immediate action in the matter,
the bears trltd to cover in various parts of the

provements in the earnings of Louisville and

West, the rÂ»lk of dividends on Omaha common
ana Chicago Gas and it ninior that the Delaware
and Hudson dividend would not be reJuctd after
all added to the bullish feeling. The directors of
the last-named company are to meet to-morrow to
decide the rate to be Dald this year. The fact that

IS STILL ALIVE
Mailed His Farewell After
His Hat and Coat Were
Found.
Friends Assert That His Disap
pearance Was Not Into
the Bay.
People Sitting N ar His Ccat and
Hat Saw No 0..c Jump
Overboard.
Oakland Office San Frajcisco Call,)_
'JOS Broadway, Jan. 5. \
There are many of *.!ie friends of W. G.
Ktuart who do not believe he committed
suicide last night. They point to a num
ber of circumstances that look as if the
missing man made very elaborate prepa
rations for a "disappearance, " but not in
the bay.
Mrs. Stuart said yesterday: "1 wish to
deny the report publis ed in a morning
paper that my husband was at one time
given to drinking neaviiy,' 1 said Mr.-.
Stuart. "It is not true and does him a
great injustice. Tiie insinuation that be
may be short in his accounts is also un
true and unfounded, because he handles
no money in h-.s department. The whole
affair is a mystery to me, and although I
have identified bis coat and hat I cannot
believe he has committed suicide."
A very intimate friend of the family
made a very peculiar statement to-aay.
"It does not look to me like a cass of sui
cde," he said, "and I think that Stuart is
siill alive. He made altogether too many
preparations. He seemed ta be so anxioui
to make it appear a case of simple suicide
that, in my opinion, he overstepped his
mark.
"In the first place, he sent a money
order to his wife a few hours after leaving
home. Later in the evening he sent her a
farewell letter, just a 9 ail suicideÃ do. But
the point that seems most suspicious to
me is that he pinned his farewell mes-age
to the vrorid on his coat. His hat and
coat were found on the -eat of the ferry
boat, and so ihat there could be no mis
take and that the wind would not remove
the name that he wrote he fastened it.
"This, it seems to me, would not occur
to a man about to commit suicide. He
had already told his wife in the letter that
he was going to drown lumsell Irom the
7:30 p. m. boat, and it is altogether too
methodical for him to do all this and then
take such pains to prove that he carried
out his intention.
"If Btuart Is dead he is the most
methodical suicide I ever heard of. In
ruv judgment he had some other reason
lor oisappearing than he divul cd. A bill
for $4J is not likely to drive a man to
suic:de who draws a good salary each
month and who is in no danger of losing
his position. I am convinced, however,
that Mrs. Stuart believes he is dead."
In support of the belief that Stuart is
still aiive is the report of two men
'dressed in the uniform of the Salvation
Army, who say that they were sitting
close to the place wnere the hat and coat
were found, and that they did not see any
one jump overboard.
It was reported ihis evening that W. G.
Smart had returned, but there is no
foundation for the report.
"\Vhe:i seen late to-night Mrs. Stuart
said : "My husband has not returned ami
nothing has been heard of him. I don't
believe that Mr. Stuari is either dead or in
the bay. I have been making some in- j
quiry and I find that his letter to me was !
mailed at 9 o'clock and his coat and hat â¢
were found on the 7:30 o'clock boat. Now \
if be came over on that boat to Oakland, j
leaving his coat and hat, he couid havf ;
L-one back on the same boat and mailed I
the letter at Station D before 9 o'ciock. I
think that is what tie did, and that he is I
now alive in San Francisco.
"I cannot understand what he means
by sayir.g he has disgraced the children
and me. He never did a thing in his life
that could be suggestive of a disgrace. If
he has disgraced us at ail it is in the pres
ent case. His health has been good, but
he has had to stay up every night for two
weeks with children who had the measles.
With his work it would be no wonder if
he had become mentally unbalanced."
Jlr<. S'.uart cslifd at the office oi IVells.
Fargo & Co. in San Francisco to-day and
learned that Mr. Stuart left half an hour
earlier last night, after drawing $42, due
him on his December salary account. She
h.is received many friends during the day,
all of whom offer her assistance us any
lorm she desires.
It is now believed, after the investica
tion made to-day, that Stuart is not alone,
but that his reference to "disgracing iÂ»is
femily' 1 has some connection with some
one else.
A NEW SWISS COLONY.
Lccated on Two Thousand Acres,
Twenty-Five Mi:es From
Livermore.
All Are Experts and a Large Cheese
Factory Is Already in Course
cf Construction
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. Jan. 5. \
An energetic Swiss colony, consisting of
half a dozen families,. has opened a settle
ment on the San Antonio Tract, which is
located about twenty-five miles south of
Livermore. One of their first movements
is. to eiect a large establishment for the
manufacture of dairy proiucts. '
The colony has already purchased over
2000 acres from the De Forest estate, and
is now negotiating for the purchase of 400
head of caUle and other stock. , The work
of cultivating and seeding 800 acres of
land is being rapidly pushed, and will be
linished in ample time for the spring
rain-. .iIHJMMI
The new colony has come from the East,
and nearly all the men and women nre
experts in their business. They have evi
dently come prepared to undertuke to
build up a manufacturing center and
there appears to be no lack of financial
aid to help along the enterprise.
John Hnyes, wiio ha- just returned
from a trip to the San Antonio Valley,
stopped at the new rolony and was sur
prised to note the energy shown by the
colony. He says that he was informed
'â¢hat several furms adjacent to the De
Forest tract will be purchased by the
Swiss colony if satisfactory terms can be
reached. It is proposed to put in a large
factory for the manufacture oi cheese on
an enormous scale. The number of cow
that are necessary to commence opera
tions will be doubled as soon as possible,
and the promoters are confident that they
will ultimately be able io supply the home
market with their products.

OAKLAND, Cal . Jan. s.â The periodi

ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. s.â The follow
ina notice appeared in an evening paper
last night:

I hereby declare myself uoi responsible lor any
debts contracted by her. G. F. Sykes.
Mr. Sykes was united in marriage to

years ago. She is a daughter of James
J. Dorsey, a conductor upon the Southern
Pacific Railroad, who formerly ran upon
one of the narrow-gauge locals in thi? city.
She is but 20 years of age. They have no
children.
Mr. Sykes asserts that some time ago his
I wife came home and declared that she was
tired, wearied, as it were, of matrimonial
bliss ana housekeeping. Furthermore she
preferred to leave him, which she pro
ceeded to do at an early day after tbe
threat. He says that she is at liberty to

Light on the Wrong Side.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. s.â The incan
descent lamps placed on the south aide of
Santa Clara avenue, between Park and
Oak streets, to light the way to the
library, do not meet wi;n tha approba
tion tuat it was intended ttiey should.
The street is damp and wet all day on that
side, while nil of the business is on the
opposite side. The north side has always
been in use, and it looks as though the
city electrician was attempting to detract
from the stores on that, side. Only 1200 or
1300 lamps aro now in u-e, while the
dynamo is capab!e of carrying 5000. En
gineer Mes3er claims that the piant i 3 run
at a 40 per cent loÂ»s, for the reason that
not enough ligiits are in operation to give
sufficient work.

ALAMEDA, Gal., Jan. 5.â A narrow
strip of land between the center line of
Harrison street and the tidal canal will
require an act of the Legislature to per
mit of its being taken into the present
city limits. The City Attorney attempted
to have it taken in two year 3 ago, but,
alter the preparation of a bill, it was
never heard from. Another attempt will
jbe made at the present Legislature. The
; Dill provides for annexation without the
j formality of an election. Senator Beard
and Assemblyman Waymire will be asked
to father the Mil.

ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. s.â Mrs. Lurja's
j jealousy almost led to her death Mon
: day. She resolved to die because the man
i that she loved was paying attention to an
i oiher woman. She accordingly went to
I the kitchen closet and took from the shelf
a' small vial of strychnine, which was
kept on hand to Kill gophers, and took a
big dose. In fact, the size of t c dose was
wiiat saved her life, for it acted as an
emetic. She had a ttespernte desire to die,
but when she found her-elf aiive she re
solved to love no one again and cling to
life.

vacation. The attendance is exceptionally
large, every room being crowde I. The
High School is so badly crowded that the
basement has been pressed into use. The

Miss E. Lovell Craib Will

Last June.
Tested Her Desire to Become an

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,^
908 Broadway, Jan. 5. )
Miss E Lovell Craib, a well-known so
ciety youui; lady of this city, will make
her professional debut on the stage next
Monday at San Dieso. The news that
Miss Craib had decided to caive out her
fortune behind the footlights was received
MISS E. LOVELL CRAIB, a Successful Graduate of Sacred Heart
Convent, Who Will Seek Fame on the Stage.
with considerable surprise, as it was not
generally known that her inclinations
leaned toward the profession of an actress.
Miss Craib is a native daughter of Oak
land and last June she graduated from the
Sacred Heart Convent in this city. She
was a very ciever elocutionist while at
ihat institution and passed her final ex
amination with high honors. She is the
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W. M. Craib,
who reside at the Ureliin Hotel. Miss
Craib has just passed her twenty-second
birthday and is a handsome and charming
young woman.
Whenever she could use her talents for
charity or any good purpose, Miss Craib
was always more than ready to do so and
her willingness and generosity have made
hÂ«r a host of friends.
In connection with her regular studies
at the convent, Miss Craib also took spe
cial courses in elocution and Delsarte and
her number in the graduation programme
last June was the cause of much com
ment. It stamped her at once rs an act
ress of marked ability and the many
favorable opinions passed on her work
bad the effect of inducing her to adopt
the stage as a profession.
"Yes, I am going to be a real serious
actress," said Miss Craib to-day; "that is
if I can be serious. I have a great desire
to succeed and intend to work bard. Next

OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 5. â The plan adopted by the congregation of the
Twenty-third Avenue Baptiat Church of raising funds without resort to church
fairs or bazaars is likely to be followed by many other churches. Key. Robert
Whitaker, the pastor, is continuing his crusade against church entertainments
for revenue, and the large body of Chr stian Endeavorers will in the near
future take a positive stand in the matter. Mr. Whitaker's church is free
from d.-bt and has a surplus in the treasury, and ita financial condition can*
not be surpassed by any church in the county.
I shall appear as Bessie, in 'Daniel
Boone,' and I am also studying n leading
character in '.Monte Cristo.' Mar.y of
my friends have expressed great surprise
at" my choice of a profession, but to me it
seems quite natural.'
Miss Craib took a novel method of test
ing whether she would like an actress'
life. On several occasions she has gone
incognito and accepted .isht parts in local
theaters without enlightening her inti
mate friends, and in this manner she con
vinced herself that >he could De happy
and successiul as an actress.

Pathetic Story of a Lad Who Is Dying
at the Keceiving Hospital.
OAKLAND, Cai,., Jan. 5. â Ira W.
Kelley, a blue-eyed, curly-headed boy who
does not appear to be more than 15 years
of age. is dying at the Receiving Hospital
of consumption. Being unable to obtain
work, he committed an act which caused
him to be sent to the County Jail. He is
evidently of good stock and a gentleman
in manners and conversation, although a
tramp.
"Mj home is in Athens, Tennessee,"
said the boy, "and I came West to look for
work. For two years 1 was a telegraph
operator for the Southern Pacific, but it
reduced its force and I being one of the
youngest men. was let out. I jjol employ
ment at Denver, but again the force was
cut and I was let out. Coming through
the snowshed I got wet and laid .'he foun

reached Oakland I was sick, and a
Con table arrested me lor evading rail

A. E. Evans and E. B. Zeigler, both of
the Southern Pacific Company, have
written for him recommendations of
which any one might be proud. Efforts
are being made to get the boy in the
Fabiola Hospital.

FARMERS MEET
WITH SCIENTISTS
State University Petitioned
for a Farmers'
Institute.
It Is Organized Under the Name
of "The San Franc sco
. Farmers' Club."
Educators in Favor of an Agricult
ural Course in the Grammar
Schools.
A meeting fraught with the utmost im
portance to the agricu.tural interests of
California was held yesterday in the as
sembly-room of the Mills buildir.p. It
was held for the purpose of requesting the
University of California to appoint a
farmers' insti-tute in this City.
A few days a/o the following communi
cation signed by about h'ity gentlemen
prominently concerned or interested in
the subject of agriculture was sent to Pro
fessor Adams of the State University, and
it was to consider the proposition that the
meeting was called:
San Francisco, December 30, 1896.
Edward F. Adams, Institute Organizer, Uni
versity of California: KtenguiÂ£ing the lact that
San Francisco has more mi ney invested in
farming lands than any other county in the
Stute, and a larger number of persons en
gaged in actual farming than any other
county, nnd also recognizing the great" impor
tnnce of the moveueut now being led Dy the
University of California, which hÂ»s lor its ob
ject in..- organization of the thinking men of
the State, directly or indirectly Interested in
securing the m. st profi. able use of the lands
of the State, lor the di-cussion and solution of
the scientific and commercial problems con
nected with agriculture:
We request that the University of California
appoint a farmers' institute, to be held in
this City at au i-nriy date, and we pledge our
influence toward promotiug attendance and
making the meetings interesting and profit
able.
At the meeting yesterday the following
persons were present:
Jv.l\vard F. Adams, chairman; Ptofes?or Mar
tin Kellogg. Professor E. W. Hilgard, A. S.
I!alliuie, Colonel E. A. Denicke, J. B. Rein

Philo I). Je.vett, Duvid Bush, Thomas V.
O'Brien, A. A. Adler, I. J. Truman, Alfred
Holuiai), :-. W. Kergusson, and Victor L.
O'Brien, secretary.
At the outset Professor Adams srofte of
the manifold interests which would be af
fected by the movement and the advisa
bility of laking immediate action.
Speeches were also made by E. F. Adams,
Professor Hilgard, A. S. Hallidie, Colonel
Denicke, J. B. Reins-tein, T. V. O'Brien,
Will 8. Green, Alfred Holman and J. Q.
James. In tieneral they were to the effect
that the institute was necessary, that
those not educated in agricultural prob
lems could not hope to compete with t ose
who were, and that an agricultural course
even in the grammar schools would not be
wasted time.
It was decided that the university be re
quested to appoint an institute to be held
in San Francisco in the near future.
P rmanent organization of those present
was effected id the name of the San Fran
cisco Farmers' Club.
An executive committee of three was
appointed by the chair in the persons of
H. H. Taylor, S. F. Thorn and V. L.
O'Brien.
Taylor offered $25 to defray the ex
penses of holding the institute, and said
if it were necessary he would contribute
$25 more.
Colonel Denicke pledged the support of
the Mechanics' Library Association to
the undertaking.
The meeting adjourned till the call of
the chair. It is probable that the insti
tute will be called for the 25th iust.
QUESTION Of DEVOTION
The Widow's Attorneys Reply
to the Stat ment of Dr.
Pardee.
If Living;, the Lately Deceased Child
Would Support Her Mother's
Contest.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,)
DOS liroadwav, Jan. 5. J
The contest over the Pardee will has
developed into a test of the devotion of
George C. Pardee and the widow of the
deeeu-ed.
George Reed, wno is the attorney for
the widow, read Dr. Pardee's statement in
this morning's paper and at once made
reply. Attorney Reed said to-day :
Every one who reals the opposition filed to
the probate of the will will readily see that
the doctor's statement to the press is a Dal
pablo attempt to divert public attention from
the conduct of the living to the dead and ex
cite prejudice against the widow by making
it appear that she in some way Attempted to
blacken the character of the father.
If he can point out a single word in the
opposition #hlch reflects on the integrity of
the dead doctor we shall bo obliged to him,
and will have it stricken out, as the insertion
of nny such mstter will be as offensive to our
client hs the imaginary matter seems to be to
Dr. George C. Fanlee.
Because the widow has charged that her
husband was weakened and his mind dis
ordered, or at least easily influenced by his
son, owing to a complication of diseases and
the use oi drug's wnicli were taken to relieve
him Irom excruciating pain, Dr. George is try
ing to twist the alii pinion into an attack upon
the Integrity of his father.
Wh?n the trial occurs we shall see whose con
duct, that of toe wile or son, proves the great
est devotion to Dr. E. H. Pardee.
The statement that a contract whs prepared,
awaiting the signature of Nellie, which

A LEGACY FOR BERKELEY.
Professor G. 91. Richardson Left Money
for a Classical Scholar
ship.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. s.â Word was
received at the university to-day that the
late Professor George M. Richardson, fol
lowing the example of Professor Whiting,
has remembered the institution by which
he was employed in his will.
Professor Richardson died worth over
$75,000 and among his bequests is an in
come for the support of a classical scholar
ship at Berkeley, or for an annual prize
for the transition uf classical English into
Ciceronian Latin. The professor's books
were aiso many of them lelt to the Uni
versity of California, the rest beinp be
queathed to Harvard, of whicti he was an
uiumnus.
Professor Whitinsr, who left $20,000 to
the Berkeley Department of Puysics, was
also a graduate of Harvard. A good deal
of similarity is noiei between the careers
ot tbe two professors, both of whom were
cat off in their prime and while away
from home.
The full details of Professor Richard
son's death have not yet been recoived,
and the news or his gifts to the university
com s through friends of the dec ased.
He was well known as a man deeply inter
ested in classical studies, of generous dis
position, and full of loyalty to the Univer
sity of California, and his bequest to that
institution will create no surprise.

Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
man is slowly wnsting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times. worse than the mo-t severe pain. There
is no let up to the mental suffering day or
night. Sleep is almou impossible, and under
such a straiu men are scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose ol poison and thus end all
his throubles. But providential inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of r combination
: of medicines that nut only completely re-tored
the -general'- health, but enlarged his weak,-
emaciated parts to natural bJm and vigor, und
he now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free. Now, when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want .every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience. . ..
I am not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as'
an enthusiast, bu; there are thousands of men
suffering the ; mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would b- cured at once could
they but get such a remedy as the one that
cured me. Do not try to study out how i can

Agaimt Several Physicians.
Detectives Silvey and Egan are camo
inp on the trail of certain physicians who
were recently in attendance udoii Mrs.
j Lizzie Grinter of 797 Mission street. The
| woman is very ill and there is every likeli
hood that she will die from the effects ol

Yesterday the Detective Department

the address given, and, strange to say, the
notification came from a Dr. Robbing, the
very man whom the girl accuses of per
forming the operation.
Lizzie Grinter is the wife of J. W. Grin
teÂ« a coachman or employe about the
stables of E.J.Baldwin in Los Aiiceles.
The couple have been separated some
time, bin in her illness the husband cnma
back. Recently the woman, who is only
19 years of age, worKed as saleslady at the
Emporium.
She first stated that in the rusÂ»h and
bustle of the holidays she was pjsheil
downstairs by a fellow-employe and m
i jured herself in the fall. Wlien told that
> she was likely to die, she made the t-tn.e

ST. LEE FIRST IN
A GREAT FINISH
At His Saddle-Girths Were
Captive, Ostler Joe and
Argentina.
Good Times Conceded Weight
and DDwned His Field
Cleverly.
Schiller Is Beginning to Fe Respected
by Bsttorsâ The 50 to 1 Shot Miss
Ross Beaten by a Nose.
Ingleside track has been noted for many
close contests. On the front page of its
weekly programme - book is depicted a
hair-raising finir-h that occurred last
meeting between Ferrier, Pepper and Ed
Kearney. To be sure that was a most ex
citing one, but the finale to the last race
run yesterday outclasses it as a new moon
does a broken sunset on the Barbary Coast.
Possibly from the fact that a quartet of
good ones were battling for supremacy 3
the event was iast on the card and no one
was observed to leave for home before it
was decided unless it was some gaunt
lookine individual whose appetite was an
even-money chance over his love for ex
citement. It was a mile and an eighth
run for a purse and the staners were:
St. Lee 109. Ostler Joe 102, Capoive 102,
Monita 104 a::d Argentina 104, not a bad
sort of a field, barring Monita, which hhd
evidently fallen among the Philistines.
Pat Dunne's Captive was monarc <â  oi all
he surveyed in the betting-ring, opening
at 6 to 5, reaching 8 to 5, and then being
played down to evens. St. Lee, at 3 to 1 j
while vcu could wink, was a consistent
2% to 1 second choice. Argentina fluctu- j
aied about in the betting, finally closing
at threes. The other two were considered
outclassed.
There can be no gainsaying the fact that
St. Lee got a most excellent ride at the |
hands of "Skeets" Martin. Wailing on j
Ostler Joe for five-eight ns of a mile Mar- j
tin then took the lead and turned into the ;
stretch half a length before Argentina, i
with tne favorite a close third and Ostler j
Joe a closer fourth. Then began a drive.
Below the paddock it looked as thom-h
St. Lee would win handily, but he was
straightened nut before the wire was
reached Bob Isom on Captive made a j
supreme effort but had to acknowledee i
defeat by a scant half length, witn Ostler |
Joe at bis head and Argentina fourth, but â 
a neck farther away. It was one of the ]
historic blanket finishes, and its like will 1
not be seen lor days to come. The win
net's time was 1:55^.
The weather wus warm and hazy, but |
the track is hardly in record-breaking con
dition yet. Three favorites and three sec
ond choices drew down the purses.
After being knocked about and cat off ;
a couple of times the 9 to 10 choice j
Meadow Lark managed to come from the I
roar in the stretch and finish a hrad be- I
fore the 6to 1 choice Scimitar. Pc-cHsmff j
tumbled into his u>ual position â third.
Gene Leigh's promising ihree-year-old 1
Goo>l Times gave away weight anil beat 1
four fairly good ones in the second event,
a seven-furlong trip. He receded, in the
betting irom 6 to 5 to 8 to 5, and al
ternating in taking the Jeail to the
stretch with Estaca, answered M'il
]ie Martin's call in the end and
downed ti.e Baldwin representative clev
erly by half a length in l:3o_VÂ£. Miss
Baker secured show honors.
Pat Dunne's Preston was the most pro
nounced sort of a favorite for the mile run
tbat followed, the ring hpldinir the brown
colt a 6 to 5 choice, although Schiller was
delighted to carry but 99 pounds. He was
prominent among the nrst four or five
throughout the running, but faiied to get
any part of the purse. Schiller came
lrom the far rear a* the field swung into
the stretch and at thÂ« wire dispose ' of Al
varado cleverly by half a length. Yankee
Doodle made a fine showing with Claw
son up, being beaten but a head for the
place.
On the strength of her second to
Falvable on Monday, Olive was considered
a pood thins 'or the six-iurlong spin that
followed, and 4 to 5 was the reigning price

laid against the Sprectels entry in tbe
ring. Bhe was never belter than third and
eventually landed outside of the money.
Potentate, the 7 to 2 second choice, made
the running trom the jump, and at the
wire barely beat the 50 to 1 shot, Miss
Koss, a nose. Brunette was third.
Lucky Dog was scratched from the fifth
even; over seven furlong?, and Benamela,
the 9 to 5 choice, di>l not experience a pre
ponderance of difficulty in beating
Alobalaska a length for the purse. Bergen
surprised himself, managing to drop his
horse. O'Fieeia, a 150 to 1 chance, into
third place.
XOTES.
This will be "ladies' day" at Ingleside
and extra cars will be run over the electric
line reaching the track. Two trains will
also convey paÂ«seneers to the track, leav
ing the Southern Pacific depot. Fourth
and Townsend streets, at 1 and 1:20 p. M.
Mi*s Ross, which was picked among
The Call's selections to get the place in
the fourth race j-esterday, was 50 to 1 in
the tettinc and was only beaten a nose
for the first place through accident. A
sixteenth from the wire one of iiarringer's
stirrups broke, and from that time on he
was kept busy sticking on the mara's
back, regardless of his finishing abilities.
Opposite the clubhouse the lad fell to the
track, but was not hurt.
Owner Nick Hall is disgusted with his
luck and will sell Mary B. and the bal
ance of his string, The first-named mare
should make a rare good one on 6ome
breeding farm, as she is bred In the
nurpie.
The entries to the rich stakes of the
Queen City Jockey Clab, Newport, Ky..
wiil close January 15. The club has been
very liberal in the way of adaed money
and is deserving of a larce entry li-t.
While at the post Preston was kicked in
the nigh hind leg by Bright Phoebus,
which did not tend to help hischances any.
Little Clawson continues riding in good
form. He put up a very vigorous ride
astride the back of Yankee Doodle.
Bricht fhoebus, the one time Realiza
tion winner, was a starter in the third
race and looked like a haybarn mounted
on a set of stilts. He wa<* left at the post.
There was to have been a real old
fashioned watermelon carving in the
fourth race. The fast gelding Fly was the
ripe, jnicy melon. Finally reaching 25 end
30 to 1 in the betting, an avalanche of
coin swept through the ring, and when
the storm cleared up 3 and 4 to 1 was the
best obtainable. When the barrier flew
up Fiy made a bolt and was almost left at
the post, finishing in last position at the
wire.

WILLIAMS ESTATE SETTLED.
Judge Coffey Signed the 92,000,000
Decree of Distribution Yesterday.
Judge Coffey yesterday signed the de
cree of distribution whereby the $2,000,000
estate of Thomas H. Williams Sr. was
divided between the two surviving heirs,
Thomas H. Williams Jr. and Frank Hans
ford Johnson, minor son of Frank S.
Johnson.
There was quite an array of legal talent,
the lawyers present including ex-Judge
George E. Williams, Rothchild & Ach,
Chickering, Thomas & Gregory and J. W.
Dorsey.
Distribution proceedings were inter
rupted several days aeo by the opposition
of Thomas Magee of this City, who repre
sented a gentleman having a claim for
$11,000 and $4000 interest against the es
tate.
Negotiations were concluded yesterday
whereby the indebtedness was taken up by
a local bank and the distribution was
granted without further objection.
Complimentary remarks were made by
Judge Ccffev on the able management of
ex- Judge Georee E. Williams, who had
charge of the estate for ten years and
turned it over to the heirs worth a great
deal more than when it passed into his
hands.

BURGLARS ON
TWELFTH STREET
The Vacant House Experts
Continue Their
Work.
Residence of Mrs. Frank Entered
While the Family Was
at Dinner.
The Burglars Were Scared Away,
bat Took With Them a Purse
and Other Articles.
A daring burglary was committed at the
residence of Mrs. Frank, 140 Twelfth
street, Monday night, while the family
was at dinner, and detectives are vow try
ing to find a clew to the burglars.
From the mode of entrance adopted by
the burglars the police are satisfied they
are the same two men who have been oper
ating successfully for the past two or three
months.
Between 6 and 7 o'clock Monday night
Mrs. frank and her family sat down to
dinner in the dining-room, whicn is in the
rear of the house. Fred, one of her sons,
was late, and when he went into the
dining-room he remarked to liis mother
that he thought he saw from the street a
light in his brother Herman's bedroom.
Herman said he had turned out the light
before going in to dinner, and nothing
more was thought about it.
After dinner Mrs. Frank went into her
bedroom, wbic'i communicates with the
parlor, for her purse, and was surprised to
find it gone.
A search was made for the purse, and
when~Herruan's Dedroom was reached it
was at once â¢ seen that burglars had been
there. The bureau drawers had been
pulled out and their contents scattered
over the floor, and the bedclothes were
aiso. on the floor, showing that the visi
tors had suspected that something of
â vaivw was concealed in the bed.
" A silver watch and gold chain, a new
Eat and several articles of jewelry were
found to be missing. A new suit that
Herman bad received from the tailor Mon
day afternoon and which had been spread
on top of the bed had been folded up
ready to be taken away by the burglars,
bin in their haste they felt it behind.
It is supposed that Fred's arrival scared
the burglars and they bent a hasty re
treat. It was fortunate they did so, as
several valuable articles of jewelry were
in the room. The purse was the only
thing stolen, and it contained about $10.
Tht burglary was reported at police
headquarters yesterday afternoon, and an
examination of the premises was made.
Jt was found that the burglars had forced
open a window in No. 138, which is vacant,
after trying to open the door with a
j;nimy. They had gone to the top floor
and opened the window next to Herman's
bedroom, making ttieir way along the
ledge to Herman's window, which was un
locked. The marks of their feet were
plainly visible on the window-sill.
It was a daring act lroru the fact tha
the house is within fifty yards of Howard
street, where cars are constantly passing,
and both streets at these hours have many
pedestrians on them.
THEY FAVOR THE CANAL.
Senators and Representatives Promise
the McrcliHiits' Association to Work
for the Nicaragua Canal.
Realizing the vast advantage that would
accrue to the industries of this coast by
the construction of the Nicaragua Canal,
the Merchants' Association of this City,
on December 12, 1896, sent to each of the
Senators and Congressional delegation
Iroiu this State a copy of a resolution
adopted at a previous meeting, requesting
them to continue their efforts to have
the canal constructed under American
control.
In response communications have been
received from Senators White and Perkins
and Congressmen Maguire, Loud and Mc-
Lacblan. They show conclusively that
the immense significance of the project is
fully realized by the writers, and that
they may be depended upon to do all in
their power in favor of the measure.
Congressman Loud says: "I shall do all
that lies in my power to secure the early
passage of said measure."
McLachlan's reply was to the same
effect but longer. "I am heartily in favor
of the passage of the bill providing for the
construction of the Nicaragua Canal," he
â ay:s "and I will do everything in my
power to secure its passage at the present
session.''
Maguire's response was rather senten
tious. After acknowledging the receipt of
the letter he stated that the subject under
consideration would "receive due and fa
vorable consideration at the proper time."
Senators White and Perkins promised
to do their utmost for the bill, and the
former pointed with pride to the fact that
he had done in the pas<t as he would do in
the futureâ "his best to advauce the pro
ject."
A Shoo Patent Suit.
An action in equity was begun in the United
States Circuit Court yesterday by the Pliable
Shoe Company of Kittery, Me., against George
Bryant and Alice K. Bryant. According to
the complaint Brvant patented certain ma.
chinery that he baa invented for muking pli
able hhoes and afterward entered into a con
tract or agreement with the shoe compauv
â¢whereby the latter, upon the payment of the
cori'ideration Bgreed upon, was to receive and
hold as its own all of the letters patent and
rights, title and interest in the invention. The
complainants state that they have fulfilled
their part of the contract, but Bryant failed
and refused to perform nis pÂ«rt. Instead, he
assignea ail oi his interests to Alice E. Bryant,
Ids daughter, without consideration and, as
the complaint states, for the purpose of de
frauding the Pliable Shoe Company out of its
right. The notion is to coin pel the Bryants to
fulfill their contract.

brella to help celebrate his seventieth

His umbrella was presented with an
original poem, and Mr. Day said in re
sponse that not even Wells, Fargo & Co.
could express his feelings. Past High

JOSEPH MURPHY APPEARS
Although Not Quite Recovered
the Comeiian Keeps His
Promise.
A GoodS z d Auiience Ass:mb es at
the Co umbia Theater to Hear
"StUIU Rhue."
In spite of having scarcely recovered
from his attack of grippe, Joseph Murphy
dia not disappoint his audience at tiio
Columbia Theater last night. His recent
illness was scarcely perceptible in the
comedian's speech or appearance, although
his voice was a little weak. Several mem
bers of the con:pany. however, were evi
dently recovering from severe colds.
The play was "Shaun Rhue," a stirring
Irish drama, which gives Murphy excel
lent opportunities for exhibiting his qual
ities both of pathos and humor. The
audience laughed responsively at all the
jokes and bright, witty sayings, and ap
plauded the pathetic scenes.
Murphy showed his old-:ime spirit of
fun and acted very touchinely in the scene
when, as Larry Donovan, he says farewell
to his mother's grave. When Lrirry dis
guises to the undoing of his enemies the
comedian assumed the travesty so clev
erly that very few people in the audience
recognized him in the assumed character
till he threw Off his disguise.
The weak spot in Murphy's impersona
tion of Larry Donovan was that his
make-up was not youthful enongh to pive
the true impression of the dasuing Irish
boy.
The support afforded the comedian was
on the whole satisfactory. Harry Gorrein
made a dashing Qerald Cuvanagh and
John Daley was thoroughly effective as
Patrick Cnvanagh; John W. Burton was
becomingly stern as Morris Donovan, and
Charles lieaudt and William T. Clark
made the villains duly detested by the
audience.
Misa Erama Italia, who played Tim, the
waif, had an appealingly forlorn make-up,
but her reading of the character was alto
gether too feminine. Miss Carolyn Klberts
and Miss Jennette Farrell were satisfac
tory as the two heroines.
There was a fair-sized audience, which
would no doubt have been larger if abso
lute certainty had prevailed as to Joseph
Murphy's appearanc.
Young Jimmy Fair* iÂ£*tate.
Charles S. Keal has been appointed adminis
trator of the estate of James G. Fair Jr., with
bonds fixed at $1000. The value of the estate
is not known, as the former administrator,
Louis C. Bres.se, died Delore the affairs of the
estate were closed.
Attached Her Real KÂ«tate.
As an aftermath of the failure of Levin Bros.,
the Market-street grocers, the Anglo-Califor
nian Bank yesterday attached real estate stand
ing in the name of Sarah Levin on a claim for
$10,000.
PRESERVE WAR
HAS TERMINATED
The Sportmen's Association
Has Changed Its
Tactics.
Knocked Out by the Supreme
Court It Will Lease a Happy
Hunting Grounds
District-Attorney H S. F oe and His
Engineers Wiil Visit the
Blockaded Sloughs.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
held an enthusiastic meeting last evening
in K. of R. B. Hall.
Questions relative to preserves and
slough blockades were discussed at length,
and Attorney Schmidt of the association
stated that owing to the present condition j
of affairs he believed it would oe a foolish
move of the association to continue the
fight against the preserve system any
longer, as the Supreme Court had in a
measure decided that question beyond all
doubt.
In his address to the association Mr.
Schmidt said that as long as there was
hope he was in favor of lighting against
the introduction of preserves, but to long
as the Supreme Court of this State has in
timated that it would decide against the
aims of the association if called uoon to
pass judgment on the question of salt
marsh preserves, the only hope left tor
the members was to dig down Into their
pockets and lease.as others have done and
are doing, a tract of land for shooting
purposes.
After considerable discnssion the associ
ation reluctantly decided to acknowledge
its defeat at the hands of the Supreme
bench and decided to lease lands suitable
lor duck-shooting purposes.
The following committee on preserves
was appointed: M. H. Sweeney, W. J.
Ahem and Charles Fitziiiumdns. They
will report at the next meeting of the as
sociation.
The association thought that some
changes were necessary in the fish and
game laws, and it was resolved that its
attorneys be instructed to make the ne
cessary alterations and forward the fame
to the vice-president at Sacramento. The
additions suggested are tnat any person
found with trout in possession less than
6 inches in length at any season of the
year will be guilty of a misdemeanor,
etc.; that English snipe be included in
the law which protects game birds during
the breeding season; that th* duck-shoot
ing season close on March 15, instead of
February 15, as it is at present.
This latter suggestion came from sev
eral members, who stated that the canvas
back and bluebill were very late arrivals
from the north, and the closing of the
season in February shut off the best
shooting of the year. Mr- Truman said
the farmers were very anxious that the
duck-shooting season be' prolonged, as
certain varieties of wild ducks were very
partial to the growing grain.
The annual election of officers resulted
as follows: President, William J. Ahem;
vice- president, Alexander Truman; sec
retary-treasurer, Charles Fitzaimmons;
directorsâ M. F. Berges, Frank E.
Sweeney, W. S. C. Schmidt and A. T.
Penebsky.

RICH COPPER
A NEVADA MINE
Sample of Ore Surpassing
That of the Great -
Anaconda. ";â¦
ThjMSrars of. a Modest Silver
9Kj}erty Excited .by a
; ' Chance Find. ,
Eager to Investigate When Weather
P.rmits to See If They Own <
a Bonanza.
A wonderfully rich prospect of pure
cooper has been discovered in one of the
branches of a silver mine ,in . Nevada,
owned partly by Dr. W. H. McLaughlin
of this City. The find was a pure accident
and might never have been; noticed but
for the fact. that the bit of rock samples
containing the copper happened to be in
vestigated by Dr. McLaughlin along with
other samples that had been sent him by
his three partners, who alone are working
the mine. They had sent rock from dif
ferent parts of the main sbatt and from its
branches. One bit supposed to contain
bismuth was particularly marked for his
notice. ;';-t>'i
He examined it carefully. He cracked
it open with a hammer and saw to his
surprise that it fell ail apart. A more
careful scrutiny of the fragments showed
bits of metallic ; copper and he continued
his examinations. Analyses showed that
the sample contained traces of most all
the metals except gold. There was silver,
copper, lead, bismuth and a number of
others.
He found that there was 90 per cent
metallic copper in the sample. Naturally
he was surprised, for metallic copper has
seldom if ever, it seems, been found in
Nevada. But 90 per cent would, if there
is more where this came from, mean a
mine richer than a gold mine, a veritable
bonanza, for 14 per cent copper pays, and
copper mines where the copper is easily
reduced are extreruÂ«sly profitable.
Dr. McLauchlin was not inclined yes
terday at first to discuss the iind. He
knows too little of the extent of the ledge,
even if there be one, and he and his asso
ciates want to keep the location a secret
until they can ascertain if they really
have a bonanza. Then they purpose to
take up the surrounding claims, for there
is much land still unclaimed about there.
Their silver mine, according to Dr. Mc-
Laugblin's not very definite description,
is situated about 143 miles northwest of
Reno. At present it is difficult to reach
unless things are frozen over. It is far
from the railroad.
"I am gome up there to-morrow," said
Dr. McLaughlm yesterday, "if I get a
telejrram from my partners saying travel
ing is possible. We want to take no
chances of having some one get in and do
some locating anead of us; but it is safe,
(or nobody but vax three partners know
where it is. If there be nothing in it, all
rigbt; if there is a good leiige it will be
worth more than n gold mine, because
there is such a demand for copper, and it
is so easy t > work.
"The sample is like the metallic copper
of the great Anaconda mine at Butte. It
was found just in a little 'pot hole' in an
incline branching off from a 150-foot side
drill from the main shaft, which is 200
feet deep. We have had the pine a couple
of years, but have only just begun to take
ore out. It is silver, ana not particularly
rich.
"I was the most surprised man in the
world when I found pure copper in the.
sample, and so were my partners when I
sent word to them.
"If there is a ledge there like the sample
it will be the ricnest copper mine in the
world. If there is nothing to it, that's all.
We will icnow inside of a few weeks."
