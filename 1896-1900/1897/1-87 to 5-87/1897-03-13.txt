Fresh Massacres May Occur at Any
Moment on the War-Stricken
Island
LONDON, Enq., March 12.â It is as
serted here on excellent authority that
the powers are exchanging views in re
eard to presenting a fresh note to Greece,
giving notice of their intention to resort
to coercive measures to enforce their de
mands if Greece does not comply at once,
and also to maintain a blockade of Greek
p>rtÂ». France, It is understood, is the
only power showing any reluctance to
taking part in a blockade, and if she re
fuses to participate the blockade will be
undertaken without her.
The Daily News will to-morrow publish
a dispatch from Canea, saying that it
would be of the greatest advantage if the
powers would formally proclaim to the
Cretans the fact that they had determined
to establish an autonomous government
ior the island of Crete. Most of the
inhabitants are not aware of the intention
of the powers. The few isolated chiefs of
the. insurgents who have learneJ that
Turkish rule in the island y to be brought
to an en i have declared their joyouS ac
ceptance of the scheme of the powers.
The correspondent of the Standard at
Canea telegraphs a description given by
r-n c\ r >-w;tness <fi the evacuation of
Kandani'os by the Moslems, who have
now reached Canea. He says that swarms i
of wild-looking insurgents swooped like i
kites on the outgoing refugees and seized
and hau'ed off oxen by their horns and
taUs. They fought desperately with each
other to cain possession of chairs and
tables. The insurgents wanted 10 loot the
place and were ready to risk their livea for
a sheep or a mule.
Thie Times will to-morrow publish a dis
patch from Athens saying that the city fa
swarming with enthusiastic rustic re
serves. Two thousand of them were sent
to the frontier yesterday.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Ttjrkey, March
12.â The general belief here is thÂ»t the
necotiations between the powers over the
reply of Greece to their demands will be
protracted. Meanwhile a renewal of the
outbreaks in Asia Minor is imminent and
Sir Philin Currie, the British Embassador,
has called the Porte's attention to the
etate of affairs existing, with a view of
averting the atrocities whfch are threat
ened.
The Christians in Anatolia are in a de
plorable condition and consequently sub
ieced to outrage. I ; is feared a massacre
will happen at Pp.yag, where the situation
is extremely critical. It iÂ« reported from
Erzeroum that biÂ»r bodies of Russian troops
are being concentrated on the Armenian
frontier from the direction of Sarikemish
in the district of Kars.
It is positively stated here that the ad
ministration of the Sultan's civil list will
seek to enter into neeotiations with the
United States Government for the pur
chase of three ironclads that are already
completed. It is said that forty thou-and
pounds Turkish will be paid on account
of the purchase price.
The Porte and the foreign diplomats
hare received news of bloodshed at
i Everek, a mountain village in Kefsarien.
ik T he situation in those regions is most
wimentsble, and rumors are current in
* is city that a massacre is impending
there.

NEW YORK, N. V., March 12.â An im
portant mass- meeting ;of the Greeks of
this city was held to-night in Chickering |
Hall- It was called by Demterios N. Bo- ;
iassi, the â  Greek j Consul-Genersl, for the
purpose of sympathy for Cre- \
tana and to devise means to raise funds to j
transport the Greek reserves in this: coun- \
try to the". Lvant. Chickering Hall was |
crowded -with the sympathizers of Greece,
and there was great applause at the vari
ous expressions of sentiments on behalf of
the Cretans.
.President Seth Low of r Columbia Uni
versity presided, and ir. opening the meet-
Ine said that the primary, object; of the
meeting was to arouse interest in the con
dition of the Cretan refugees in Greece. .
"It is hoped," ne said, "that when the
facts are fully understood the American
people will be willing to contribute lib
erally to help the people of Greece to carry
this heavy r.m: unusual burden.
"His blood must run cold, indeed, that
has not been stirred by the heroic action
of little Greece in rushing to the relief of
Crete in the face of armed and protesting
Europe. It may well be believed that the
reliance of Greece in this enterprise is not
upon the strength of her own arms, but
upon the justice of the cause. ; : She may
safely appeal to the considerate judgment
of mankind for the sanction of her under
taking. The civilized world has small
confidence in a European concert that
has been able to maintain' the peace,' but
has not been able to preserve the Arme
nians from being mas-acred by the thou
sands. I venture to say that American*
at least, almost without exception, are
glad that whatever becomes of Greece or
of Crete the experience of Armenia shall
not be repeated in Crete while Greece is
able to protest. It is earnestly to be
hoped that she shall not have accepted
these lists nor poured out her blood and
treasure in vain. Her appeal is v- to ; the
public opinion of the civilized world, and
we in America would be false to ourselves,
false to our history, false to our aspira
tions if at such a moment we did not re
ply to Greece in words of no uncertain
sound that she has unreservedly our sym
pathy, our applause and our prayers. "J';vk
Consul-General Botassi* read the list of

NEW YORK, N. V., March 12.â A Press
special from Jacksonville, Fla., aays:
Cuban Leader Acosta made a raid on the
suburbs of Havana within half a mile of
two blockhouses Wednesday night, cap
turing three Spanish soldiers and two of
ficers. The attack was made on the turn
pike or military road, as it i:i called, one
of the best fortified rcadways on the
island. The point of attack was a little
hamlet, where there wÂ«re two large store
houses containing considerable ammuni
tion and also clothing for the Spanish
forces.
The two blockhouses were located with
in half a mile of the place. The Cubans
dashed in, looted the storehouse and then
set fire to them. They then retreated
rapidly to the right and came up in the
rear of the Isabella blockhouse.
The troops in this, seeing the burning
buildinps, rushed out, leaving only a
small guard behind. The insurgents, per
ceiving thi , managed to break in the
blockhouse door, and in ten minutes were
in full possession. Knowing that they
could not remain, they looted the building
of all equipments that would be valuable
to them, consisting of two stands of arms
and considerable ammunition. They
spiked the small field pieces, and setting
fire to the house inside dashed away hur
riedly.
The Spanish pursued them within half
an hour, but came back two hours later,
and reported that the rebels could not bÂ«
found.
The only report made in Havana regard
ine this engagement was that a force of
rebels had been dispersed, but the main
facts are known all over town.

Pitiful Scenes at the Electrocution of a
Ndgro Charged With
Murder.
SING SING, N. Y.j March 12.â Arthur
Mahew, a negro, was successfully electro
cuted in the prison at 11:17 o'clock this
morn.ng.
Mahov suffered the death penalty for the
brutal murder of Stephen Powell, a prom
inent and wealthy resident of Hampstead,
L. 1., March 17, 1596. Powell had been
waylaid, robbed and murdered. John
Waynes, a nepro, and Arthur Mahew, also
colored, his friend, were arrested. Waynes
made a confession accusine Mahew of the
crime and implicating himself. Waynes
is now serving a fifteen years' sentence in
Sing Sing for complicity in the crime.
Mahew died proclaiming his innocence.
He made resistance when lie reached the
chair and had to be forced into it by the
keeper*, where he struggled until
strapped in. Mahew was terribly fright
ened and appealed to the keepers not to
turn on tbe current until he cried he was
ready. All during tho operation of fas
teninv him down in the chair Mabsw
erteS^ouf: 'I aii> not guilty! I'm dyifig
an innocent man! John Waynes and Al
bertson are guilty !"
These cries be interspersed with, "Jesus,
have mercy on me. O Lord God, save
me!"
It was a pitiful scene. Frank Albert
son, who was accused by Mahew in his
dying breath of being implicated with
Waynes in the murder of Mr. Powell, has
never before been mentioned in connec
tion with the cr.rue. That there is such a
man is not even known by anybody in
terested in the case. Testimony during
the trial showed that only two men were
concerned in ihe crime. Several lawyers
Here to-day took an interest in the man's
strong protestations of innocence ana
Wayne's confe c sion that Mahew was not
implicated in Powell's murder, and ex
pressed the fear that perhaps Mahew may
have been mistaken for Albertson, and
that the unfortunate negro was innocent
of the crime for which tie died.
CHICAGO'S SHOOTHG MYSTERY.
The Young Woman Accused Is Released
From Custody â Buttercup Story
of the V.ctim.
CHICAGO, 111., March 12.â The mys
tery surrounding the shooting of Mrs.
Catherine Bra^g id still unexplained.
Josephine, Mrs. Bragg' s fos'.er-daughter,
who was arrested soon after the shooting
was discovered, and who it is thought
could exulain everything if she desired to
do so, was released from custody this
atternoon. She was first taken before her
mother st the hospital and much that
transpired during the time that she was
there Jed the police t^> believe that the
adopted daughter fired the shot ihat
wounded Mrs. Bragg. She declares, how
ever, that she is innocent of the crime
and her mother will not betray the secret
of the shooting.
Mrs. Bragg has disinherited her foster
daughter, to whom she had willed her en
tire proprty, amounting to $50,000. It
was reported this aiternoon that $10,000
worth of diamonds brlonging to Mrs.
Brage had been stolen, but that they were
found to-night at a pawnshop, where Mrs.
Bragg haa'plnced them.
Josephine Bragg's father, H. L. Parker,
of Lynn, Mass., is well known there and
prominent in yachting circles. About
sevenieen years ago. according to the
story Mrs. bragg told at the hospital lo
niglit, Mr. Parker was married, and when
a year later he and his wife wer** in Chi
cago a child was born to them. For sev
eral weeks Mrs. Parker was in a hospital
here, and when they returned to Massa
chusetts the child was left in Chicago.
'â¢The birth was kept a secret," said Mrs.
I Brairtr, "and only three persons in Chi
cago knew what hnd become of tbe infant.
They were Mr. Brag?, myseil and the
nurse who carried ti.e baby to their home.
This cuild was adopted into the Bragg
family. Josephine's father and mother
have seen her but ouce since then, and at
that time iooked upon their daughter
from a window across the street.
"When Josephine had attained the age
of five, and was able to understand, the
nurse began to impose b ackmail on her
foster parents. The amounts demanded,
however, were becoming larger as the gin
grew in years, and four years ago Mr. and
Mis. Parker were asked to come to Chi
cago and make a final settlement with the
woman. They did c^me, and that is the
time when they looked upon their daugh
ter Irom a window opposite the Bragg
residence. From that time the uurse
ceased her demands."

of the right of a Judge to release a prisoner
on bail pending the hearing on a writ of
habeas corpa?.
Anderson questioned this right and Mc-
Enerney cited a number of cases in which
such action had been taken â¢ by the Su
preme Court. He claimed that this had
been the practice of the Supreme Court for
forty yea is.
Anderson alleged that bail was only ac
cepted In such cases when the respondent
did not question the right of the court in
the premises.
Judge Hughes evidently had no great
desire to have this matter argued, and de
clared that the investigation of this propo
sition at this time was not pertinent.
"The rieht to is<sue the writ, he said "is
not contested. The question of bail con
cerns action that has been taken by the
court and it is past history. Throughout
the tJnion it is the practice in Superior
and Supreme courts to release prisoners
on bail uudsr similar circumstances, and
Ido not care to hear any further discus
sion on that proposition. Proceed to the
main quetion of the case."
McEnerney, alter reviewing the inci
dents that led up to the present situation,
stated that one of tho questions was:
"Can a legislative body, investigating a
charge like this, compel a witness to tes
tify as to what he had been told." Such
testimony, he declared, would be hearsay
and not complete. His second proposition
! consisted ot the question: "Has the Sen
ate jurisdiction to make the inquiry to
whicu the questions propounded to Law
rence and Levings were directed." He
claimed that if it had not such jurisdic
tion trie questions were not material and
there was no contempt.
In the endeavor to prove that there
was no jurisdiction in the matter on thÂ»
part of the Senate, or rather that the
Senate had overstepped its powers in en
deavoring to iriquire into a slanderous
and Jibelous attack on the members of the
Senate, he quoted from the resolution
adopted by the Senate. This provided
for an investigation relative to the bribery
charges and also for the punishment of
any one found guilty of having slandered
ana libeled the Senate or any of its mem
bers in ti eir official capacity.
McEnerney alleged that ilie Senate had
absolutely no power to go into the ques
tion of slander and lioel. Setting fonh
his third proposition tie said: "The judg
ments of court 3 are always op.n to review
in court for want of jurisdiction, and the
same principle applies to legislative
bodies."
His fourth point was that the Legislature
has no general power of investigation,
and that it has no power to use the
machinery of the Legislature to ascertain
for private persons whether or not a pub
lished article is slanderous cr libeiouj.
The remedy for slander and libel, he said,
is in the courts, either, by criminal or
civil action.
He concluded by an argument tending
to show that the questions asked of both
Lawrence and Levintis were immaterial,
irrelevant and incompetent. Throughout
the argument numerous citations were
made from the habeas-corpus jurispru
dence of tbia country and of England.
Assistant Attorney-General Anderson,
controverted by competent and late
authorities and decisions the stand taken
by MtEuerney. After calling attention to
the fact that McEnerney had admitted
that the Senate had jurisdiction to inves
tigate charges of bribery he claimed that
the resolution adopted by the Senate pro
viding for the inquiry conld at the most
only be held invalid so far as the matter
of inquiring into the slanderous or hbel2
ou* character of the Examiner fake article
was concerned. He quoted from the case
of ex-p;irte McCarthy to prove that not
only hud ihe Legislature, or either branch
of it, the riÂ«;ht to inquire into bribery
charges, but that it also had the ri^ht to
protect itse.f from the slanderous and
libelous attacks of newspapers. But his
strongest point, and the one upon wbicu
the whole ca=e ninges, related to the mat
ter of the jurisdiction of the Senate and
the power of the Superior Court to re
v.ew the action of the Senate upon a
question of fact.
Anderson contended, and there was no
attempt to controvert him on this point,
that in matters wherein the Senate had
jurisdiction no Superior Court could co
into the question of the materiality or im
materiality of any question asked by the
Senate or a Senate committee during an
investigation of bribery charges. Such a
question conld only be considered by a
court of concurrent jurisdiction and never
by an inferior tribunal.
On this ground he held that the court
had no other course open to it, in view of
the fact th<it the jurisdiction of the Sen
ate was not attacked in the presÂ»nt issue,
but to remand Â« he prisoners. In conclu
sion he pointed out why, in his opinion,
the questions objected to by the counsel
of the prisoners were competent, material
and relevant.
Deputy Attorney- General Post con
cluded the argument for the respondents.
He confined himself to tne questions of
the relevancy of the questions asked by
the Senate investigating committee and
the rights of the Senate to be exempt from
review in any matter of fact by an inferior
court.
McEnerney closed tv.e case without
any new points and Judge Hughes took
the matter under advisement until to
morrow morning at 9:30 o'clock.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 12.â The
Assembly committee on the Examiner
libel investigation resumed its session at 9
o'clock this morning, and spent the whole
forenoon and a part of the afternoon in
examining witnesses without eliciting
anything that would throw light on the
subject.
Railroad Commissioner H. M. La Rue,
stated under oath that he knew nothing
of the matter under investigation, and did
dot know that the bill existed until he
read the libelous article in the Examiner.
Thomas B. Bishop, of the law lirrn of
Garber, Boalt & Bishop, said that Alvinza
Hayward wat a client of his; that Mr.
Hayward had not mentioned the matter
of bill 273 to him. The witness knew
nothing whatever about, the case.
W. S. Dargle of the Oakland Tribune
said that at the request of George W.
Baker he had either sent a dispatch or a
telephones message to Assemblyman Leav
itt asking him to support the bill. George
W. Baker had told the witness that the
measure emanated from the Liquor
dealers' Association.
W. Beede, manager of the Postal Tele
graph Company, at this point was re
quested to produce all telegrams or copies
oi' telegrams which had passed through
his office between Senator Voorheis and
George W. Baker on the subject of the bill.
Mr. Beede was recalled in the afternoon
and informed the committee that he had
examined all the telegrams in his office,
but failed to find any from George W.
Bafaer vr JSenator Voorheis with reference
-Uiifssembly bill 273.
Several Assemblymen were examined,
it dec'ared that they knew nothing on
i he subject.
The committee will hold Us final ses

LABOUCHERE'S IRE AROUSED.
Accuses an Equ vacating Witness of Tes
tifying Falsely in the Jameson
Raid Inquiry.
LONDON, Exc, March 12.â The exami
nation of Sir Graham Bower, formerly Im
perial Secretary at the Cape Colony, was
resumed to-day. Witness testified that
he had never told Cecil Rhodes to commu
nicate his intention of assisting in the
rising in the Transvaal to the High Com
missioner. He understood that Rhodes
intended to do so. Rhodes, Sir Graham
continued, had communicated his inten
tions to him as a personal friend, not
as imperial secretary. He did not know
if he had ever asked Rhodes whether he
had informed the High Commissioner of
his plans.
Mr. Labouchere, who is conducting the
examination, insisted upon a positive re
ply by the witness to the questions.
The High Commissioner, he said, had
wired last evening denying that he had
ever been told anything before the raid
that showed any connection between the
force that had gathered on the frontier
and the citizens' movement at Johannes
burg.
The witness persisted in the statement
that he could not recall whether Rhodes
had said to him that he had told the High
Commissioner of his intention.
At this i.oint the chairman interposed
and ruled against Mr. Labouchere's con
tinuing to press the point, whereupon Mr-
La bouchere said he believed the witness
was not telling the troth.
Mr. ChamDerlain, speaking warmly,
said: "The commission must protect the j
witness from insult."
Mr. Labouchere â I repeat that it is my
opinion that the witness is not telling the
truth.
The chairman â Yon are out of order.
Mr. Labottchereâ l snail move that the
room be cleared on every opposed ques
tion, if necessary. I am going to see
whether this examination is a sham or a
reality.
The chairmanâ This is not the way to
facilitate business.
Mr. Lubouchre â The way to facilitate
business is to let me ask quest'one.
Then, turning to the witness, he said:
"Did Mr. Rho les keep faith by informing
the High commissioner of his intention
of assisting in the rising? "
The witness vouehsaied no reply to the
question, whereupon Mr. Labouchre
asked : "Do you decliot to speaÂ£ in order
to shield yourself?"
Other members of the commission in
terposed at this point, but Mr. Labouchere
persisted in demanding an answer to his
question, and the witness finaliy said: "It
is a matter of opinion whether Mr.
Rhodes kept his word or not. I decline
to say further."
In reply to a' question by Sir William
Harconrt the witness said he did not
think that Mr. Riiodes had co-operated
with the High Commissioner in such a
way as could have averted the raid.

TOBACCO TRUST VICTORY.
Boycotted Cigarette Jobbers Dealing
With a Rival Concern Vairly Appeal
for Judicial Relief.
TRENTON. N. J., March 12.â 1n the suit
brought to annul the charter of the Ameri
can Tobacco Company and break up what
is known as the tobacco trust Vice-Chan
cellor Reed this morning riled an opinion
dismissing the bill and ending the pres
ent litigation against the company. In
the language of the Vice-Chancellor the
action was brought ";o restrain the de
fendant from transacting its business and
from conducting it in a manner prejudi
cial to the company interests and injuri
ous to the people of the State of New
Jersey."
The bill was filed by Attornty-General
Stockton on the petition of John K. and
Frank W. Wilbur, jobbers In paper cigar
ettes, with whom the American Tobacco
Company refused to deal, according to
the allegation of the Millers, because they
persisted in handling the "Admiral" ci.
arettes, manufactured by a rival corpora
tion.
Vice-Chancellor Reed holds that the
equity court lias no jurisdiction ; that the
proceedings should have been brought in
the nature of quo warranto, and that the
corporation has a right when legally
formed to deal the same as individuals.
The points raised by the complainants
and Vice-Chancellor Reed's full views
may be inferred from the f Mowing sylla
bus which he has attached to the de
cision:
1. A court of equity does not possess the
power to restrain corporations organized
under the forms of law from performing acts
w.thin its corporate powers merely because
homo of the steps taken in organizing the com
pany may have been irregular or because the
purpose of the incorporaiors may have been
to establish a motiopo y.
2. Under these conditions quo warranto is
the proper proceeding to challenge the right
of the corporation to exercise Its franchises.
3. A trading or manufacturing corporation,
until its charter is annulled by such a proceed
ing at law, Has the same authority as an indi
vidual trader or manufacturer to sell or con
sign its goods, to select Its selling agents and
to impose conditions as to whom they shall
si I. nnd the terms upon which they shall sell.
4. A decree restraining tlie officers and
agents of a corporation from executing corpo
rate acts is the same as a decree enjoining the
corporation itself.

Two Hundred Boozier Convicts "thrown
Out of Imployment.
MICHIGAN CITY, Im>., March 12.â
Warden Haley of the Indiana State prison
yesterday ordered the instant suspension
of all work by every convict not hired by
a binding contract. This sndden action
was due to the discovery that an emer
gency clause was attached to a bill passed
by the General Assembly abolishing con
tract labor, and the bill tnus became a law
as soon as Governor Mount signed it. The
result is that 200 men are locked in their
cells with no means of employment.
The new law provides that contract work
shall be abolished as fast as existing con
tracts expire, and by the end of the year
more than 30u men will be idle. It was
intended that convicts should be engaged
in making goods for other State institu

put the plan into operation.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 13, 1897.
THAT COYOTE
CLAIMS BILL
Ridiculous Rumors as to
Bribery Circulate at the
Capital.
Men Who Voted for the Meas
ure Are Above Such an
Unjust Suspicion.
Guy Explains That the Beard of Ex
eminers Has Piwer to Prevent
Any Fraud.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 12.â The
coyote claims bill came up in the Assem
bly this morning for reconsideration, but
a reconsideration was refused.
Wright of Alameila said that he voted
yesterday in favor of the passage of the
bill, "but," he added, "1 tel you frankly
that I was never so anxious to get out of
anything in my life as I am to get out of
tnis this morning. My reasons are largely
contained in the report of the State Board
of Examiners, which I hold in my han.l,
and which ia the original report, not a
copy."
Wright read several rows of figures from
the report, and staled that he had b?en
informed that under the provisions of the
bill the Board of Examiners would not
have time to make sufficient inquiry into
the claims, so that the illegal and fraudu
lent ones might be segregated. From
Kern County alone there liad been sent
coyote scalps in such enormous quantities
that if there baa been that number of
coyotes in that county they would have
devoured everything in the county, in
cluding the inhabitants thereof, and then
would have been obliged to have eaten
one another in order to keep from starv
ing. In addition to those matters he had
Ueard so many rumors of bribery in con
nection with the bill that he coula no
longer give it his support.
Rumors of bribery in connection with
the adoption of the coyote scalp bill are
rife around the Cap'tol bml ling, and all
because of an injudicious remark of
Wright of Alameda to the pffect that he
had beard from rumor that $25 apiece was
paid for some of the votes in favor o_f pay
ing the claims. An examination of the
vote as recorded will show that there is
no truth in the rumor, for the Assembly
men who voted in. favor of the measure
are above such an unworthy suspicion.
The vote was as follows:
Ayesâ Allen, Arnerich. Austin, Be!
--shaw, Bettman, Boone, Breihnu, Bndg
ford, Burnett, Burnharn. Caminetti, Cut
ter, Dennery, Dibble, Dolan, Emmons,
Gately, Godfrey, Goff, Good hue, Guy,

The biil confers upon the State Board of
Examiners such powers as are neevied for
intelligent action in the matter. It Is
Assembly bill 410 introduced by Gusr of
San Diego and will in all probability be
npproved by tne Governor, as it gives the
Governor and the two other members oi
the ooard full authority to discriminate
against illegal and fraudulent claims.
Those who know Guy know that he
would not introduce a bill to countenance
a fraud in any manner. The bill itself
gives the lie to all the rumors of fraud
or bribeiy. It provides that all persons
having claims against the State for coyotes
killed pursuant to the law, sball present
those cla ms to the State Board of Ex
aminers for approval and allowance within
three mon hs after the approval of the
act. The Board of Examiners or any
member thereof, or its expert, are given
full power and authority to compel the
attendance of persons and papers lor ex
amination. The bill empowers the board
to administer oaths and to punish wit
nesses for perjury. Two hundred ana
eighty-seven thousand dollars, or so much
thereof a- may be necessary, is appro
priated to pay the claims allowed by the
Board of Examiners uuder the provisions
of this act.
Those claims have been before the Ex
aminers for more than two years past.
Evidence taken by the board was to the
effect that frauds had been committed in
Kern and other counties, and that coyote
scalps had been shipped from Mexico,
Arizona and some of the Western States
to more than one county seat in Califor
nia, and that public officials had been in
volved in the scandal. But under the law
as it stood the board was powerless to sec
rebate the false from the true, and Assem
bly bill 410 was irameii by Guy especially
for tlie purpose of enabling tne Examiners
to reject all claims about which there
hung an odor of fraud and to allow the
legal ones.
Guy when interviewed by a Call cor
respondent this evening was imlignant
over the rumors of bribery in connection
with his bill. "People who are saying
that there has been bribery in connection
I with this bill don't know what they are
talking about," said he. "The Board of
Examiners approximated the amount suf
ficient to pay legitimate claims. Then
i t*iey requested the Attorney-General to
preparo an act by which claimants would
be required to present their claims within
three months after the passage of the act,
nnd the Board of Examiners would make
an investigation and a;. prove of all ciaira*
they might find to be legitimate. False
testimony can be punished as perjury.
The bonrd may not use the whole sum of
$287,000, but only so much thereof as may
be necessary to pay valid claims.
"As a representative of people largely
interested in those claims I will not con
sent to any further postponeroet of tne
payment of the legitimate ones. The in
tegrity of the great State of California is
at stake iv this matter, and 1 don't, want
this State to set the example of repudia
tion of honest debts. Country merchants
have furnished food and ciotning and
farming tools in exchange for those scalp
certificates furnished by the Boards of
Supervisors,' and those business men
should not be kept out of their money any
longer. The old law autnonzes Boards of
Supervisors to examine the evidence â
namely the coyote scaJps â and to issue
certificates therelor, and then to destroy
the ev.dence. The certificates, therefore,
issued by the Supervisors are the only
evidence we have of the validity of the
claims. But whenever the Examiners
find that the person to whom the certifi
cate was issued was guilty of fraud ihey
wi'l refuse to pay the claim."
The nmount of the appropriation repre
sents 57,523 dead coyotes. This is not an
improbable number when the great area
of the coyote district of California id taken
into consideration. But the proportion
from the southern counties is beyond all
reason, and it is in this direction that the
attention of the State Board of Examiners
will be focused.

CARELESS CONGHESSHEN.
Many Members- Elect Who Will Appear as
Foohah Virgins Whin the Ex ra
Session Convents.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 12.-Con
gressmen-elect have been singularly negli
gent in forwarding to the clerk of the
House their certificate* of election so as
to get their names placed on the roll
which the hold-over clerk of the House of
Representatives will read at the meeting
of Congress in extraordinary session on
Monday next. No one whose certificate
has not been received can be placed on
that list except by unanimous consent
At noon to-day there were twenty-nine
certificates missing. This negligence is
the more remarkable inasmuch as the
Representatives begin to draw pay from
the 4th of March just as soon as their
certificates are enrolled. Those who are
not on the list cannot, of course, partici
pate in the organization of the House,
but it is quite likely that nearly all the
present absentees will turn up on Mon
day to bring their certificates with them.
They were all notified at the beginning of
the week to have their certificates ready.
The following are among the Congress
men-elect wno?e certificates are missintr:
Californiaâ l, John A. Barbara; 6, C. A.
Barlow; 7 C. H. Castle. Idahoâ James
Dunn. I.iwaâ 4, Thomas TJpdegraff; 10,
John P. Doiliver. Kansasâ 2. M. IS. Peters;
3. E. R. Rulgely; 5. W. I). Vincent.
Nevadaâ F. G. Newlands. Utahâ W. H.
King.
Mr. McMillin of Tennessee, who is a
prominent candidate for the Democratic
nomination for Speaker, is also one whose
certificate is missing, and it was only to
day that the certificates of election of
Messrs. Richards n (also of Tennessee)
and Bailey of Texas, who are Mr. McM^
lin' s opponents for the honor of the Den^
cratic leadership in the House, were re
ceived.
Some of the men elected to Congress last
fall appear not to have realized that it
woula be necessary to have their certifi
cates ai testing that fact filed in the office
of the clerk of the House. One of them,
It is said, had his certificate placed in a
nandsome frame and hung in bis library
at home, and another before coming to
Washington to attend the special session
placed his certificate alonz with other im
portant and valuable capers in a fire and
burglar proof safe, which is safely locked
and nobody except himself knows how to
unlock it.

SACRAMENTO, Cal.. March 12.â Santa

a representative so able and energetic as
Matt Arnerich, one of the Assemblymen
from that county. Mr. Arnerich is sel
dom absent from his seat and oy close at
tention to bills effecting his constituents
he has done a vase amount of good for
Santa Clara County.
"The bill in which I take the most pride
in having passed through the Assembly,"
Assemblyman Arnerich of Santa

said Mr. Arnerich in reply to a question by
a Call reporter, "13 that appropriating
$25,000 for the purpose of dredging Alviso
Slough. Tbe people of my district had
been working for twenty years to secure
this improvement. It is one that is vital
to tbe prosperity of the farmers there.
Alviso Slough, if dredged and made per
manently navigable, would nfford a cheap
outlet to tbe bay for all tbe farmers and
fruit-growers in that very fertile district
"But the project had always been fought
by tbe Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany because its success would take away
a large quantity of freight wmcli is now
hauled to the railroad cars because there
is no outlet to boats on tbe bay.
"The bill forming agricultural districts,"
continued Mr. Arnerich, "and making ap
propriations for the same was another in
which I had taken great interest. The
districts were practically abolished by the
last Legislature, and the farmers de
manded that they should be re-established
at le.nst in part.
"You see," added the giant from Frobm,
"the farmers have no opportunity or place
to show their fine fruit and vegetable ;
products except at tbe district fairs, j
That's wby I supported the bill, and I
think I did my share in baying it passed
through the Assembly.
"The bill removing the girls from the
Wbittier school to San Jose was another
in wbicb I interested myself. It was an
economical measure. The Wbittier people
wanted an appropriation of $150,000. We
saved $110,000 by appropriating $40,000 for |

The San Francisco Covers Herself With
Glory and the New York Is a
Good Second.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 12.â
Gratifying reports hare been received at
tbe Navy Department of the speed of the
finest new ships of the new navy under
ordinary service conditions â the New
York of the home station and the San
Francisco of the European squadron. The
San Francisco, after her recent docking at
Genoa, according to a report transmitted
by Admiral Sellridge, bad a run in the
Mediterranean, maintaining a speed
slightly in excess of 18 knots for tbe un
usuaily long period of ten hoars, tne
record speed of ibe vessel for a four hours'
burst having been 19)4 knots â this with
picked coal and crew and extreme forced
draught.
The performance of the San Francisco
in covering over 180 knots in ten hours
under the service conditions, with only a
flight air pressure, is most gratifying to
Eneineer-ln-Chief Melville, as is the report
of Captain Schley of the New York, which
recited that the New York on her iecent
voyage from Hampton Roads to New
York kept up. an 18-knot gait ior four
hours between known points off the Jer
sey coast. Th is was accomplished under
natural draught with a foul bottom. Cap
tain Schley is very proud of the run and
expresses the conviction that the New
York can make 21 knots over lons dis
tances whenever haste is required.

to All Jntfreit*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 12.â The
Republican members of the Ways and
Means Committee are working over the
pottery and woolen schedules of the tariff
bill to-day, and endeavoring to arrange
the reciprocity clauses Ft as to open
French and German markets to American
products and livestock. A good deal of
tronble is being found in putting the
woolen and DOttery schedules in a form
satisfactory to all interests. The commit
tee is endeavoring to agree vi on specific
duties instead of ad valoiem rates, which
formed a pert of the McKmley law as well
as the present lair.
The wool-growers are very much dis
satisfied witn the rates on carpet wool and
the committee is endeavoring to adopt a
general scale of specilic duties. The
variety of articles in the pottery schedule
makes a specilic system difficult to
arrange, but efforts in that direction are
being made. The McKinley schedules on
both these articles are likely to be em
bodied m the bill to be introduced in the
S House next week, leaving changes to be
made if they are found practicable, at a
later stage in the consideration of the
measure. The method adopted for com
pelling France and Germany to abolish
their restrictions upon American lives. ock
and nvat products is the offer of slight
concessions in the duties upon mineral
waters, champagnes, gloves, bilks, chicot
and argot.

Increase in Duties Made in
the New Tariff
Law.
McKinley Rates Restored on
Many Important
Stap es.
Chairman Din?ley of the Ways and
Means Committee Is Ready to
R port.
NEW YORK, N. V-, March 13.â A
Herald special from Washington says:
Chairman Dingiey of the Committee on
Ways and Means expect to nave the row
tariff bill ready for publication on Tues
day morninf.'. He said last night the Re
publican members of the committee had
practically completed the entire bill and
were now engaged in reviewing their wort
and making ciianges necessitated by the
relations which various schedules have to
eacn other. The bill as a whole is a high
protective measure. The average rates
are li t tie, if any, below those of the Me-
Kiniey bill and in some of the schedules
they are shsrhtly higher.
Though changes may be made before
the bill is preseuted in the House an out
line of the various schedules indicates its
general character and the more important
changes from the present law which have
been made. When the task of preparing
* new bill was first undertaken the com
mittee was disposed to be very conserva
tive and frame a measure which would be
in the nature of a compromise between
the McKinley law and the present law.
Schedule A, dealing with chemicals,
oils and paints, is far more nearly like the
present law than the McKuJev bill, but
some important changes have been made.
B.ue vitriol is taken irom the free list and
made dutiable at 2 cents per pound.
Crude borax is increased to 3 cents per
pound, berate of lime to 2 cents and re
fined borax to 3 cents per pound. Cop
peras is tafcen from the free list and made
dutiable at the rate of 3-10 of a cent per
pound. The McKinley rate is restored on
magnesia and flaxseed oil.
The duties on all lead products are in
creased to correspond with an increase in
tnÂ« r:ite on lead and lead ore. Acetate of
lead is made 3 cents per pound; litharge, 2
cents; nitrate of lead, I} 4 cents; lead and
white paint containing lead, 3 cents per
hundred.
Sulphate of soda is taken from the free
list and restored to tne McKinley rate.
Sulphur ore is taken from the free list and
niade dutiable at 40 cents per ton. Crude
tartar is made dutiable at 3 cents per
pound.
No schedule in the bill has given the
committee so much trouble as that re
lating to earths, earthenware and glass
ware. Efforts, so far unsuccessful, nave
been made to devise a satisfactory classifi
cation to serve as a basis for the specific
ir. stead of ad valorem duties or. pottery.
Tne committee is still at wort at this, but
the probabilities are that earthenware
generally will be rsstored to the McKiniey
a<t valorem rates.
The McKinley rates on glassware have
been restored throughout with some im
portant increases. Plate-glass not exceed
ing 16x24 inches square has been in
creased from 5 to 6 cents per square foot;
above that and not exceeding 24x30 inches
pqoare increased from Bto 12 cents. There
is no increase ia the larger sizes over tne
McKiniey rates.
Silver plate glass and looking-glpss
plates not exceeding 16x24 inches square
'have been increased to 8 cents per square
foot; above that and not exceeding 24x30
inches to 12 cents; about that and not ex
ceeding 24x60 inches decreased to 23 cents ;
all above that reduce! to 38 cents.
In the metal schedule the rates of the
present law have been pretty well ad
hered to as to iron and steel. The Mc-
Kinley rates on hoop, band iron, etc.,
have been restored, with the exception
that cotton ties will pay one-tenth cent
per pound in addition to the duty im
posed upon the iron or steel from ihey are
made, instead cf 2 cents. In the present
law they are on the free list.
The classification is changed in the para
graphs relating to sheets of iron or steel,
including black taggers iron or steel, by
th â  addition of a new class, thinner than
No. 12 wire gauge, at 12-10 cents per
pound.
The duty on tin plates is placed at l'Â£
cents per ponnd. Under the McKmley
law it was 2 2-10 cents. On steel ingots,
etc.. the classification of the present law
is the same and the duties are a com
promis-' about half way between those of
the McKinley and the present law, be
pinning with 7-20 cents per pound on all
valued at 1 cent a pound or less and run
ning to 6 cents on all valued above 16 cents
per pound.
On iron or steel wire, known as crinolino
wire, the duty is increased from 40 to 45
per cent, with a proviso that articles man
ufactured from iron or steel wire shall pay
the maximum duty on the wire and 1}..:
cents per pound additional. On anchors,
mill irons, etc., the rate is increased to
half a cent per pound. Anvils are restored
to the McKinley rates.
Tnere is an entire new classification of
penknives. Those valued at not more
than 40 cents per dozen are dutiable at 35
percent; all other penknives having one
blade, 50 cents a dozen ani 20 par cent;
all having two blades, $1 a doz;n and 20
l>ercent; all having three blades, $1 50 a
dozen and 20 per cent; all having four
blades or more, $2 a dozen and 20 per cent.
In rase tue handles are pearl or tortoise
shell 50 cents are added on knives of two
blades and 75 cents on those of more than
two bludes.
McKinlf-y rates are restored on razors.
Table and c irvirg knives and fork* with
handles of peari or ivory will pay 15 cents
per dozen and 15 t >e r cent; with liandl. sof
bone or celluloid, 12 cents per d< zen and 15
per cent. On wares of iron, steel or other
metal, enameled or glazed, the rate is in
creased from 3<J to 40 per cent.

to 6-10 per cent pur pound, horseshoe nails
from 30 per cent to 2 cent* p*r nound,
wire nails from 25 per cent to %. % and 1

list at the McKinley rates with the excep
tion of while pine, which is now classed
with jcruce, and pays $li per thousand

law.
A clause is inserted providing for an ad
ditional duty of-> 5 per cent ad valorem on
lumber, to bÂ« imposed in retaliation in
case a country imposes discriminating
taxes on similar articles proposed to be
exported to the United States.
Tne t:ix on toothpicks is changed from

AFFLICTED WITH
ABNORMAL SIGHT
Not Argus With His Many
Eyes Could Equal This
Man.
Portland C tizen Who Sees As
Though Through Magnify
ing Lenses.
One Optic Is Far-Sighted, While Dis
tance Robs the Other of Its
Power.
PORTLAND, Or., March 12.â Frederick
Baufield, who suffered an injury to one of
his eyes three years a<jo, inflicted by a
flyiner splinter in the East Side Southern
Pacific shops, is just back from Vienna,
after a course of treatment. While there
he was for two months totally blind. His
sight after it was restored to him proved
remarkably abnormalâ in fact, the most
scientific authorities on diseases of the
eye say that there is no similar case on
record. Bau field's right eye became
hyperopic and the left myopic; in other
words, he could see nothing close by with
his right optic, but at a long range he was
enabled to discern the smallest object.
Then, at a distance of twenty feet, the
largest object was blurred to the left eye,
but within six inches* of it the most in
finitesimal atom was magnified to as great
proportions as though it were beneath the
most powerful microscope.
Baurield is somewhat sensitive on this
subject, as most abnormally afflicted peo
ple are, yet a lew days ago he practically
demonstrated to a few intimate friends
tiie unheard-of degree to which he was
suffering from hyperopia and myopia.
On one of the recent clear aiternoons he
read the print in a newspaper at a dis
tance of 200 feet, while his left eye was
blindfolded, but when the paper was
placed immediately before him he was
unable to decipher a letter. In addition
he described the color of a very small
piece of cloth one of his friends had pro
jecting from a thumb nail 800 feet distant.
To test his myopic vision a strong
microscope was employed. Two tests
were made, the right eye being closed. A
drop of water and a small piece of a house
fly's wing were the objects. In both in
stances Baufield described with the use of
his naked eye what the other saw only
with the aid of a powerful instrument.
DEATH AT PACIFIC GROVE.
Edward Shamp, Ex- United States Consul
to Guatemala, Stricken by Apoplexy
While Bathing.
PACIFIC GROVE. Cal., March 12.â
Edward Shamp, ex-United States Consul
to Guatemala, was stricken by apoplexy
yesterday while taking a bath. A
paralytic stroke followed closely upon the
apopieptic attack and death came just as
assistance reached him.
Mr. Shamp had been seemingly in bet
ter health than usual during the past sev
eral days. For weeks he had been ailing
but no one thought his illness serious. A
member of the family, happening to pass
the bathroom door yesterday, heard
heavy and convulsive breathing. Fearing
that something was wrong, Mr. Shamp's
name was called, but he made no answer.
The door was locked, but one of the ladies
who had more presence of mind than the
others ran for an ax and battered the lock
uotil it gave way.
Mr. Shamp was found lying limp in the
water, with his head hanging over the
bathtub, as though he were asleep. As
sistance was immediately summoned and
he was remove.! to a bed. Almost as soÂ«n
as he was lifted from the bathtub ne went
into convulsions and grew black in the
face, and before the doctor arrived his en
tire right side had become paralyzed.
Cliloroiorm was url ministered to ease him,
and death speedily put an end to his suf
ferings. He never regained consciousness
after he was found.
Mr. Shamp suffered a similar attack, but
one of much le9s severity, while in
Pnceiix, Ariz., last summer, and the phy
sicians believed it had affected his mind,
causing sottening of the brain. He was
compelled to abandon his business and
come to Pacific Grove to recuperate. He
and his family were visiting his wife's
mother, Mrs. Styer.
Mr. Shamp was Vice-Consul to Guate
mala for a number of years and afterward
held a diplomatic position in Mexico. He
had large business interests in both coun
tries up to a short time prior to his death.
He recently met with heavy losses and it
is believed worry over these failures in
duced the two attacks of paralysis, the
latter of which proved fatal. Hid body
was taken to-day to Calistoga, his family
home, where it will be buried. Mr. Shamp
leaves a widow and four little daughters.
SALMON MEADOWS COINERS.
Manufacturers of Bogus Miney Cleverly
Snared by a Secret Service
Detective.
LEWISTON, Idaho, March 12.â After a
long search by a Federal secret service
roan for counterfeiters operating among
tne Nez Perces Indians, there are now in
jail in Grangeville John Eddy, Louis
Eddy, James Eddy, Frank Frcileigh and
Charles Scroggms. They were locate! in
the vicinity of Salmon Meadows, a valley
bordering the Seven Devils Mountains,
where the snow lies seven feet deep. The
detective worked into their good graces
until he was initiated into the mysteries of
making spurious coins. He worked with
them until he was trusted even to cach
ing the tools, and with James Eddy made
a jourm-y to the land of the Nez Perces to
"shove" some of the "queer."
This was his opportunity. When the
two reached Camas Prairie with the bogus
money the detective induced a stockman
to arrest James Eddy on a charge of steal
inercattle. This was a false charge, and
Eddy cduld readily prove an alibi. The
examination was deferred and Eddy was
detained until the datective could return
and bring out the balance of the gang as
witnesses on behalt of the alleged cattle
tliief. It would have been impossible to
capture the men in their rendezvous, but
once out over tne snowshoe journey they
were all arrested. So clever was the de
tective's woric that no breath of suspicion
attached to him until the counterfeiters
were in irons.

SAUSALITO DOCTOR ARRESTED.
Gets Into Trouble Because Another Man
Sold Him Books Obtained
by Fraud.
SAUSALITO, Cal., March 12.â Robert
McDowell, one of the aeents of the book
linn of D. Appleton & Co., has accused
George Bing, one of the proprietors of the
now defunct Marin County Herald, of
a felony. D.'. Richard Freeman of Sausa
iito is also implicated, and late this
afternoon McDowell swore to a second
complaint against the doctor, charging
him with applying language of a bad
character to him and disturbing the peace.
Marshal John E. Creed arrested Dr. Free
man and brought him before Judge Pryor,
where the doctor told his story. The Judge
put the hearing over until to-morrow.
According to Robert McDowell George
Bing wrote to the San Francisco agents of
D. Appleton ior a set oi sixty volumes of
n scientific publication of tbe value of $104.
Binir said he was the editor of the Herald,
published in Sausalito, and upon this
seemingly excellent showing the books
were delivered to him without a deposit
being required. Bing never paid for the
volumes, and Appieton & Co. learned
through Bing himself that he had dis
posed of half of the books to Dr. Freeman.
Bing had thus committed a felony and he
threw himself upon the mercy of the book
firm and begged it not to prosecute bim.
McDowell, representing tbe firm, came to
Sausalito and visited Freeman, making a
demand for the books, which he claims he
saw in Freeman's front office through
the open door.
To-day McDowell came to Sausalito,
procured a search warrant, and together
with Marshal Creed and Prosecuting At
torney Sylva went to Freeman's office and
looked for the booKs. Alter a thorough
search sixteen volumes were found packed
away in a closet and they were taken to
the Recorder's office. While the party
was in the office Freeman called McDowell
some choice names and the two almost
came to blows. Then McDowell had Free
man arrested for using vulgar language.
Freeman does not deny using the lan
guage and says be called the man a liar.
Freeman said that Bine came to Him
"dead broke" and wanted money, und of
fered to sell bim the books for $25. Free
man bought them and after reading them
sent some of them to a brother in England
and some to other places. He says that
Bing gave him a receipt for tbe money
which he paid ior the books and this ho
has.
As to the charge of using bad language
the doctor asserts that McDowell told him
what was not true and he called him a
liar with a few expressive adjectives to
give it force.

STOCKTON LAWYERS FIGHT.
While at Court One Styles Another o
"Pettifogger" and War Is
Declared.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 12.â A. H.
Carpenter, attorney-at-law, used the word
"pettifogging" in reference to Frank D.
Nicol, attorney-at-Jaw, in Justice Parker's
court this forenoon. Mr. Nicol struck Mr.
Carpenter. J ustice Parker adjourned court
for the day to allow Mr. Carpenter to have
his eye treated, as Mr. Nicol's fist closed
it completely. Mr. Nicol was fined ?25.
The row occurred t.iis morning during
the trial of a civil ca<e in which these at
torneys appeared. Mr. Carpenter was ex
amining a witness and Mr. Nicol made a
legal objection to a question. Mr. Car
penter in replying mimicked Mr. Nicol's
intonations. That nettled the attorney
for the defendant, and when the next
question was asked he said:
"We object to this pettifogging way of
examining a witness."
"You had better quit your pettifogging
way of practicing then," retorted Car
penter.
The word "pettifogging" has something
of the same effect upon a lawyer as the
flaunting of a crimson flag in the face of a

ORANGE, Cal., March 12.â Fruit and ;
hay prospects are better than they have
been at any time during:, the past decade.
This is essentially a fruit-growing section.
The rains ; commenced early and have
fallen with | a regularity and abundance
which rarely occurs. There are no prece
dents upon which to base an - estimate : of
the growing fruit crop, as the coming into
bearing of young orchards, lie propitions
ness of the season and the skill with which
horticulturists now manage orchards
makes it all but a certainty that this will
be the most abundant | harvest ever made.
;â¢ Practically all of our land is under culti
vation. What is not occupied by citrus
and deciduous trees or walnuts is devoted
to hay," peas, coin and potatoes. -,- The hay ;
crop will be abundant in quantity, but
owing to its rank growth ; will not all be
first class. *v The green peas are nearly all
shipped and neve netted Â growers \ as well
as usual. .'; The \ orange crop, .taken *as a
whole, is of much better quality than has
ever before been shipped.- Tlie trees are
bearing well and' shipments are going for
ward, at the rate of about twelve carloads
| a week. The poultry industry, brings to
this ; immediate neighborhood about $30-;
000 a year. Orange needs a cannery, cheap
freight rates east' and protection on her

Smuggling Ming in tfaihington.
PORTLAND,. Ob., Marcn 12. â The
customs authorities were to-day given
information which shows that Chinese
are now coming into the United States in
larger numbers than ever in the palmy
days of the great smuggling ring with
headquarters in this city. Coolies are now
run into the country through Stevens
County, in Northwestern Washington.
At this point the country is the wildest of
wildernesses. Coolies pay $100 at Spo

PORTLAND, Ob., Marco 12.â C. O.
Walker, a young man heretofore highly
respected in this city, was arrested this
afternoon on a charge of obtaining money
under false representations. The charge
is the outgrowth of a real estate transac
tion wherin B. P. Durphy intrusted a
piece of property into Walker's hands for
disposal, the price agreed upon being
$4000. The latter claimed to have sold it
to a number of prominent gentlemen for
$6000 and secured heavy advances. This
story was a myth, hence the arrest.

ST. PAUL, Minn., March 12.â Last
night's storm was the greatest for several
winters. The Pacific Coast trains coming
into the St. Paul depots this morning pre
sented an appearance seldom seen evon in
the wildest kind of a blizzard. The Great
Northern coast train, due here last even

this morning. Wnen it rounded tbe
curve and came in sight of the depot it
looked like a big white bank of snow. No:
the remotest resemblance to an engine
conld be seen. The train was hauled by
two big engines, each coated from six
inches to several feet deep with frozen
snow. The engineers and firemen were
drenched with snow, which melted inside
the cab, and they were completely ex
hausted.
There is from three to five feet of snow
on the ground all over this section. An

THE LAST
OBSTACLE
REMOVED
Martin Julian Agrees to
the Rules Announced
by Siler.
WARM DEBATE ENDS IN
HARMONY.
Differences Over the Disputed
Clinch-Hitting Clause
Settled.
STUART HEAR 3 OF A BAKDIT
CONSPIRACY.
laformed of an A leged Plan to Raid
the Eex-Oifica en the Day
of the Fight.
CAESON, Nev., March 12.â The squab
ble.over the rules which are to govern the
great Corbett-Fitzsimmons battle was
settled this afternoon alter a long and
acrimonious debate, in which the chief
participants were Martin Julian, who is
Fitzsimmons' manager; William A.
Brady, Corbett's mentor; Referee George
Siler and Promoter Dan Stuart. Julian
and Fitzsimmons acknowledge, finally,
that Biler has the right to interpret the
Marquis of Queensberry rule 3, and both
promise that they will raise no objections
or do anything tending to delay the big
fight. For that reason Dan Stuart is
breathing once more.
During the past few days Stuart, while
essaying hia wonted offhand and easy
going way, has been greatly worried. The
objection 'raised at the eleventh hour by
Fitzsimrnona to Siler's c ucidation of the i
real Marquis of Qaeensberry rules meant â 
far more than appeared on the surface. It
really threatened the consummation of
the entire boxing carnival project and
nobody knew this better than Dan Stuart j
himself. The big Texan is not the kind of I
man who lets trie world know what is dis- j
turbine his vitals and the fact that failure I
ana tlie loss of about $73 000 already in- I
vested by him in this venture stared him
in the face did not prevent him from wear
ing to-day bis customary pleasant smile |
and assuming his everyday affability.
The truth of the matter is that no man
has ever undergone much greater mortal
torment than has this bi? good-natured
man from the ranges of Texas. There was
every praspect that after all of his con
niving, hisâ outlay of money, and the
chances he was taking in the public pation
izinc the venture, the whole project would
â¢tall through, and ail on account of one
little clav e in the rules, as interpreted by
George Siler, thai wh->m no more honest
man ever refereed a glove contest, accord
ing to the reputation the sporting world
â¢gives him.
This one clause 1 have frequently made
mention of m my correspondence to The
Call. In fact The Call was one of the
first papers in the United States to an
nounce to the world that Fitzsimmons
was "Kicking over the traces," and ask
ing that Siler bar the rule permitting hit
ting in the clinches and in the break
aways. When Siler made public the rules
that are to govern this fight of the cen
tury, Fitzsimmons plainly announced
that he would not fight if the clinch clause
was allowed to ?tani.
Biier could not very well afford to back
down from his position, and then Dan
Stuart came forward as peacemaker. The
. uppermost desire in Dan's mind was to
prevant a quarrel that promised to spoil
trie fi^ht. To come right down to it be
cared nothing about the rulesâknew noth
ing about them and did not want to know
anything about them â and was not partic
â  ular how they :vere adjusted so long as
this was acconi piisiied amicably. There
fore it was that Dan suegested a little
conference between Siler and the repre
sentatives of the principal-.
The talk took placo this afternoon. It
was intended that the meeting should be
held in Stuart's office, but inasmuch as all
of the parties concerned agreed that the
press representatives sbov.ld be allowed to
be present â and they are thicker than
bees in Carson jast now â the party ad
journed to Odd Fellows' Hall.
Martin Julian was tiie last of the con
ferees to arrive, but was the first to open
the proceedings when once they had sat
Cown for business.
"There are one or two clauses in the?e
rules, gentlemen," said the Cornishman's
genial little manager in opening his
speech, "that do not strike us as being
. quite the right thing. Now, ruie 1 says
that this is to be a fair and square staiid
upfignt and in a twenty-four-foot ring.
Right on lop of this comes rule 2, which
declares that there shall be no wrestling
or hugaing. More than this, rule 12 says
'that all matters not provided or in these
rules shall be governed by the London
prize-ring rules. For the iife of me I can
not make out from a s'ndy of Mr. Siler's
rules just what kind o; a tight we are
point; to have. And right here I want to
ask you, Billy" â and here Julian turned to
Brady â ''what were t >c rules that gov
erned Corbett's fight with Sullivan T 1 '
"I haven't got a copy of them in my
.â¢ pocket," replied Brady, puffing vigorously
. at hiscigar'and gazins at the ceiling.
"Bat didn't thO3e rales provide that
there sbould be no hitting in the clinches
,or in the breakaways? Give me the
straiebt business, Billy."
"Yes, 1 guess you are right about that,"
replied Brady, stiii studying the overhead
frescoing.
"But, then, you must remember one
thing. Martin, my boyâ tbat tight was
stopped in the seventh round by the
referee because Buliivan violated that
very provision. Corbett could have bad
the decision then and there, but he would
not have it. After that round both of
them fought according to the old-time
and Marquis of Queensberry rules, hit
ting in the clincnes and breakaways. Sul
livan should really have lest the fight in
the seventh round."
"Well, never mind about all that,"
paid Juiian, with an impatient -wave of
his hand, "let me tell you something.
You waut a square, stand-up nglit. Cor
bet;, has repnatedly said that. Now I am
willing to Bay right here that on the first
foul my man commits we will let the ae
cision (:o against us without a murmur.
There will be no fouling on our side. We
only want a fair, stand-up fight. I don't
see as there is room for any farther argu
ment."
"Of course there should be no more ar
gument," responded Brady, at last bring
ing his optics down from their heaven
ward focus. "The referee has formulated
the rules and made them public. That
should settle all argument."
Julian riled up a bit at this. "The
referee has nothing to do with this fight
until the men get into the rinp," he said,
pointing his finger in Siler's direction.
"Well, here are the rules, and we accept
them," said Brady, in his aggravating
and nonchalant way.
"But they an* not good rules," snapped
Julian. "For instance, did you ever see
anything in the Marquis of Queensberry
rules that barred the pivot blow?"
"Regarding the pivot blow, the rules
say that all biowa must be delivered with
the glove," was Brady's reply.
"Now, look here, Martin," he went on,
drawing his chair closer to Fitzsimmons'
brother-in-iaw, "when George Siler was
selected as referee, Fiiz3immons agreed
that hitting in the clinches should go and
remarked that it would be as fair to one
now as to the other. Now, what does he
mean by â "
"Fitz never said that," broke in Julian,
hotly. 'He only said that he wanted a
fair, stand-up fight."
Siier was called upon to elucidate on
this point, and he said that Fitzsirnmons
distinctly told him that clinch-hitting
would be satisfactory.
"Oh, the trouble is that Fitz thought
he had the best of it then, bat thinks
otherwise now," chipped in Brady.
"Well, now we won't go into that mat
ter," said Julian. "The whole matter will
be over in a few days."
â¢'You bet it will," chimed in Brady, the
irrepressible.
Then they wrangled all over the rules
again for at least half an hour, nobody
else offering to break in with a suggestion.
"Now, look here, Julian," said Brady,
finally, "iet me ask you something. You
want this fight brought to a definite con
clusion, don't you, so that the world's
championship question will be settled for
good?"
"Yes," replied Julian.
**You dou't want to win or lose on a
foul, do you?"
"Nope."
"You don't want to leave matters so
that either man will have a whip in his
hand, so that he can lose the fight in a
foul when he finds that he is getting the
worst of it, do you ?"
"No, I don t," replied Julian. "But,
see here, Corbett has been saying all along
that he wanted only a fair, square, stand
up fight. Why does he now want to mix
Loudon prize-ring rules with tnese?"
"Wnat Corbett wants has not figured in
j this case at all," was Brady's reply. "He
has said ali along: that he would be Â«a"is
litd with anything the referee ordered.
Mr. Siier has announced his rules, and
j Corbett, true to liis word, accppts them.
Fitzs.mmons said the same thing in Chi
cago. Besides, in this case, I believe we
i should take Fiizsimmons' word instead of
I yours. I don't recognize you at all, as a
dictator, any more tbun you should recog
nize me in such n capacity.''
"You need not make any cracks like
that now/ said Julian, who was getting
warm in the region of his collar again.
''lam FitzMtnmons' manager, and 1 say
right here that he never told me that he
ever agreed to iet hitting in the clinches
go."
Siler was appealed to again, and he de
clared emphatically that Fuzsimnzons did
! agree to It. ''He said he wanted it,"
j added the referee, "and when I found that
Corbett did not care wnethcr the rule
! went or not I incorporated it, believing
thst 1 was p:easing both sides."
Then there was a spell of desultory talk,
: in which most of what had already been
i said was rehearsed. Julian was pressed
j for his reasons â or ratner Fitzsimraons'
â¢ reasons â for changing his miud about the
chncu clause, and fortue fir^t time during
the session tue Cornish man's manager
divulged what lie had all along atip.ir
i ently sought to suppress.
"I will be frans with you, gentlemen,"
be said. "Fitzsimmons has never prac
ticed the art of â well, I will cnll it â "
"Infighting," interrupted Referee Siler.
"No, it is not langhtinf," retorted
Julian sharply. "It is nothing more
than wrestling and hugging, the very
thing that one of your rules says is foul.
We believe tnat to permit hitting in the
clinches would be u.ifair to us. Corbett
won ttie title of champion o: tue world in
a hght where the clincn clause was elim
inated, and I think he ought to be man
enough to defend it under the same con
ditions. We believe that the rules gov
erning the contest should not have been
announced until the day of the fight."
"Then there would have been a squab-
I ble at the ringside end the public would
I be the sufferer," said Siler.
"So far as we are concerned the public
does not figure in this matter at all," re
plied Julian. "I a tn going to look after
my own interests and FiizJmmoiid' â no
body else r .-. 1 had one dose in San Fran
cisco in the Sharkey light, that I will
never get over. It I hadn't been a fool
I would not have been caught that time;
but I am going to look out tins time ana
stick to my rights clean through."
There wan another wade through the
"fair, staiidap fight" talk, and Siler finally
asked Julian what would happen if they
postponed announcing the rules until the
day of the fight, and at ttiat time the
principals could not agree.
"The . referee would have to decide,
wouldn't he?" asked Siler.
"Well, i wouldn't agree to it even then,
if the decision was that clinch-hitting
went," was Julian's stubborn response.
"Then there would be no fight.' said
Biler. hoisting his feet to a resting-place
on the table i "lore him and pulling his
ciu'ar vigorously.
This latter remark aroused Dan Stuart
from the reveries he had been enjoying
all through the wrangle. No fight meant
that he would be out thousands of dollars,
and besides he would be kicked and cuffed
from onu end of the continent to the
otiier. Dan immediately proceeded to
pour oil on the troubled waters. He
oatted Julian ou the back and rearranged
I Bil'y Brady's necktie. He hoped they
i would straighten things out, he said, if
! it was only for nis saSe.
Julian gazed at the carpet for a spell and
then g:;ve ;he first evidence of approach
ing at quiescence.
"There is one thing I do want," he said,
taming in a conciliatory way to Brady.
"Our gloves are ready for inspection, and
I want yours brougnt in as soon as pos
sible for the same purpose."
"We agree," said Brady. "Make it to
morrow morning."
"Good."
"At Mr. Stuart's office?"
"Yep."
; Stuart asked if he should keep the gloves
until the day of the fight, and both Brady
and Julian nouded their assent. A silence
followed, while Julian ; again devoted his
attention to the carpet. : ;: .: " â¢ !*.;â '

evidence enongh to show him that bis

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 13, 1807.
There was another awkward silence, but
it was finally broken by Julian.
"I'll leave the whole thing to buer and
Stuart to decide," he said, jamming on
his cap and Btarting lor a tramp around
the room.
Stuart and Slier then retired from the
room for a consultation, and when they
returned about live minutes later Stuart
walked directly to Julian and told him
that Siler would not change his rules, now
that he had once formulated them, and he
hoped Martin would look at the whole
matter in its right light. Fitzsimmons'
manager was inclined to be obstinate.
"Just think of the hole I am in,
pleaded the big Texan.
"Well, all right, Dan." blurted out
Julian. "We will call it off. I will abide
by the referee's decision."
"Good boy, Martin," chorased the
throng of newspaper correspondents, all
of whom admired the little fellow's pluck
and generosity.
"Now look here, boys," said Julian, ad
dressing the correspondents, "I want to
say to you that Fitzsimmqns has given in
to his opponents iu-every right he has ever
had. He will do it again in this case.
These are not the Marquis of Qupensberry
rules, but we will take a chance."
And thus was removed the greatest of
all obstacles which has confronted genial
Dan Stuart'" gigantic project and over
which he has actually fretted himself
sick.
Corbett and Fitzsimmons did not go out
on the. same highway to-day, and neither
aid they indulge in any fake meetings or
quarrels for the benefit of the "exclusive"
brigade. This is not saying, however, that
with another $500 each they would refuse
to swear by another such yarn.
Dan Stuart had no more than rid him
self of the row over the rules to-day when
he received another shock, but this one
will not cost him half so much worry as
the other. It came by mail. An old
sporting friend of Dan's, who now resides
in Pasadena, wrote to him to the effect
that while on a train recently enjoying a
a few whiffs in t tie smoker he had an op
portunity to overhear the conversation of
several rough-looking characters. These
fellows were hatching a scerne to ride into
Carson on horseback on the day of the
Corbett-FilZÃimnions tight, swoop down
on the box-office and plunder it of the
thousands of dollarH that will doubtless be
there on that occasion. Dan's friend in
forms him that the entire plot was fixed
up while be listened, and the conspirators
agreed to meet in Truckee on the 16ch
inst.
"Well, to be forewarned is to be fore
armed," said Stuari to-day. "I guess we
will be on band to receive the gentle
men."
Inasmuch as the intrepid Bat Masterson
will be in cttarge of the i-rotective force at
the arena on the 17ih, and will be accom
panied by a swarm of trusted Southern
gunfighters, the chances of the bandits
would seem to be rather in doubt. The
boxomce raid on a big-event day has not
been attempted by the freebooters in iare
years. The last really sensational ho d
up of this character occurred nearly thirty
years ago in Kansas City, when the notori
ous James brothers and their accomplice?,
the Youngers, swooped down on tne fair
grounds and carried away ail of the
receipts.
The Western Union people have been
given a little scare, too. A big wire-tap
ping plot has been discovered, whicn, if
It should be successfully carried out,
would rob the company of many thou
sands of uoliars. I understand that the
conspiracy was hatched in Sau Francisco,
but has important Eastern connections.
Th-* plan was to tap the wire coming out
of the arena and get the information se
cured thereby to the poolrooms in advance
of the regular bulletins, thus giving the
sure-thing gamblers what is kuown in
sporting parlance as a "lead-pipe cinch"
on the final betting.
But all this is not to be. Stuart was ap
prisei of the plot to-day and has agreed
to assist the company in protecting its
rights. Sentinels will be placed all alone
the route traveled by the wire, and as
these men will all be armed it will be
rati er dangerous for the tappers to in
dulge in any funny business.
The training of Oorbett and Fitzsim
mons to-day did not aiffer to any >rreat
extent from the regular routine. Both
took advantage of ths tine weather and
djy roads and did about seven miles of
sprinting during the morning and in the
afternoon went through t eir indoor ex
ercises. Corbett distingui&hed himself by
knocking out Billy Woods again during
one of their boxinn bouts. Billy declares
that be is going to drop his pneumatic
musk and breastplate because they offer
-ufh a temptation to Corbett to hit hard.
The result is that he gets a worse b.-ating
than does any ot the other trainers, de
spite the protective devices he wears, and
he doe? not like his job. The onlyconso
laiion Billy has is that the day of the
battle is near at hand ana his troubles
will scon be over.
While out at Fitzsimmons' camp this
morning 1 took occasia% to obtain the
opinions of the Cormshman'* trainers as
to the duration of the big battle. Here
they are :
Ernest Roeber â Fitz will win in three
rounds, to a certainty.
Dan Hickey â If Fitz does not win in six
rounds the right is liable to last twenty
rounds, with Bob on top.
Jack Stelzner â Fitz is liable to win in
one round or it may last forty.

Neat Sum Realizal for the Cia.s
Annual to Be Issued by the
Juniors.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
March 12. â An appreciative audience wit
nessed t he performance of "She Stoops to
Conquer," given this evening by the
Sword and Sandal Club in the Encina
gymnasium. The comedy was presented
for the benefit of the '98 annual, and was
a decided success. A neat sum will be
netted.
Five different scenes were staged, special
scenery having been engaged in San
Francisco. The presentation was under
the supervision of Walter M. Mclntosh,
business manager; Will H. Irwin, stage
manager and coach; H. D. ConnicK, mu-u
--cal director, and W. t. Jordan, electrician.
Several of those who took part in the per
formance displayed decided ability. . Wal
ter Mcln tosh '97 as Diggory acted the
part in splendid style. His delivery was
excellent, and his ! make-up as a pompous
bead servant could not be improved upon.
His brother, William Mclntosb, also tilled
a minor part acceptably. The mischiev
ous, unruly Tony Lumpkm, was imper
sonated by J. S. Briscoe. He entered Into
the spirit of the part and made a decided
hit during the evening. ',
Frank Riley, the clever member of the
Glee Club, made an excellent impression.
He is at home on the stage and under
stood his part. The actine of W. E. Price
as Mr. Hardcastle met with approval. He
is easy on the stage and has a eood voice
for one of the heavier parts. The part of
George Hastings, the lover of Miss Neville,
was carried = out by George Bosch. His
wooing bcene . especially pleased lie audi
ence. Hoi brook, ,'B7, although 'appearing
in but one scene, made the best of bis
opportunity. â  '." . â  '
Miss Grace Dinkelspiel was a very
pretty Miss Hardcastle. ,r She is a member
of the freshman class and is considered
one of the stars of the company. She
took the lighter parts of . the careful coun
try mis* with great delicacy. Miss A.
Morley as Miss Neville shared the' honors
of the evening with Miss Dmkelspiel.
Her voice was a trifle I weak at - time;, but
she acted well. Miss May -Parrel! as Mrs.

STANFORD'S BASEBALL TEAM.
Coach Langs Depart for the East After
Getting the Players Into Winning
Form.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal..
March 12.â Coach Lange finished his en
gagement with the candidates for the
Stanford Varsity team, and left on the
afternoon train for San Francisco. On his
way to the Chicago baseball team's train-
ing quarters at Hot Springs, Ark., he will
stop at Carson to see the Corbett-Fitzsim
mons fight. He expects the former to win
in the encounter.
Lange leaves the team in good condi
tion, lie thinks that with conscien
tious practice a winning team should be
pitted against Berkeley this year. The
position be has had the most difficulty in
filling is that of pitcher. He finally sifted
the men down to Beckett 'CO, one of the big
football players of the freshman class. In
the class games he lias pitched goud ball.
He "sizes up" a batter and with a number
of efficient curves and a good delivery is a
safe man in the box. In an emergency
either Murphy '00, or Clemens '98, could
take his place.
A. fc>. Jeffs captain of the junior team
and last year's catcher on the Varsity
nine, will till the position behind the bat
tnis year. His woric has been of the best,
and in the preliminary games he has made
a good average as a safe hitter. His game
is at all times the best he is capable of put
ting op.
"Home Run" Young will play first
base. He has held tne position for three
years, and is out for regular praotice. riis
batting of late has not been up to his
standard, but be is getting back into his
old form. He is thoroughly reliable on
first buse.
â¢ Second base will be rilled by Glare
Strohn, captain of the victorious fresh*
man team.
Lougheed '00 will undoubtedly play
shortstop on the Varsity team this year.
His work has met with Lange's decided
approval. He comes from Los Angeles,
where he played on severnl baseball teams.
Clemens 98 is playing quod ball, ana
Lange say- be is a sale man for third base.
Lange says the positions in the outfield
will pc: Thompson (captain), right field;
Freeman '89, center field, and Wight
'98. left field.
R. Strohn '98, Klauber '98, Cotton '98,
Hawlej '00, and several other men, are
out for practice regularly, and before the
season is over may win a place on the
tenm.
The first game of the Jeanne schedule
will be played with the Santa Clara team
on the camuiis next Wednesday afternoon.
The freshman baseball team will play
Beimonton the campus Saturday morn

A DESTITUTE FAMILY.
Death Deprived Five Small Chil
dren of a Mother's
Care.
â² very sad case of death, sickness, des
titution and semi-starvation, caused by
enforced idleness, was called to tbe atten
tion of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children yesterday, and was
investigated by Special Frank A. Hol
brook.
Alfred Schlinger, a German bricklayer,
has for some time past resided with bis
family in the rear of 834 Mission street.
His family consisted of nis wife find five
little children. Eucenie is B\Â£ years of
age, Johanna "t\i, Salina 5, Leu 4, and
Charlie a little over 2 yeara.
For a long time the husband has been
unable to secure employment, and what
little money he had was soon gone. On
the 2d inst. the mother died of blood
poisoning after a long illness, and her
funeral was a pitiful affair. The lost re
spects that could be paid to the wife and
mother took tbe last cent and all that the
unfortunate man could borrow.
On the following day there was not even
a crumb of bread for the hve helpless chil
dren and they would have gone to bed
with empty stomachs bad it not been for
an aged colored man known as Professor
iMingo, wbo lives in the front honse. He
fed them ami put coal in their empty
stove, for as it is krcwn the nights have
been bitter cold. In tact from that day
to the present time the old colored man
haÃ kept the family from freezing and
starving to death.
Finally the condition of the motherless
little ones was called to tne society's at
tention and Holbrook found that the
father was blameless for hi s offsprings'
suffering. The three girls were s-nt to
the Ladies' Protective and Relief Society
and the two boys were temporarily pro
vided for. Thefather is willing to work,
but in the past few- months fortune has
turned her face from him.

George McGregor Deacon
Arrested for Em
bezzlement.
William R. Larzslere's Book
keeper Said to Be a
Defaulter.
The Examination of the Books R. veals
a D ficiency of a Total of
$6455 43
George McGregor Deacon, bookkeeper of
William K. Larzelere, commission mer
chant at 320 Davis street, was arrested
yesterday by Captain Jules J. Callundan,
superintendent of Harry Morse's Detec
tive Agency, upon the charge of felony
embezzlement.
The accuied is a young man of respec
table parents who reside on San Carlos
avenue. He was married a little over one
year ago.
The accusation against Deacon was
made after the books which he had charge
o' had been examined by an expert who
found a shortage oi 16455 43, with other
items in the shape of bills which the ac
cused had entered on the books as having
been paid, but which are now being pre
sented to his employer for payment.
The arrest of Deacon and the expert ing
of the books was brought about by the
suggestion cf Captain Callundan, who
was consulted by Mr. Larzelere over som
errors which he discovered after Deacan
had been suspended, which suspicion
was brought about by Deacon's neglect of
business previous to the 20th of last Feb
ruary. At that time, owing to his indif
ference to business, Larzelere demanded
the keys of the desk and safe, and Deacon
was sent to perform some other work for
the house.
In looking over the books a discrepancy
of $680 was found, but so great was the
confidence reposed in the bookkeeper that
this item was looked at rather as an error
than as a defalcation.
In the meantime Deacon had skipped
out, and went to Portland, Or., where
Mode's a er:cy in that place located him.
He did not remain long in Portland, how
ever, but crossed over to Victoria, B. (j.,
where he was again located and advised
to return to this City, where a chance
would be given him to straighten his ac
counts.
This advice he followed and arrived
here on last Sunday afternoon, but he
failed to make clear tnat the errors in his
accounts were mere errors of entry and
not fraudulent in their nature. In the
meantime an expert had been at work,
and upon his showiner Captain Callundan
was notified and took Deacon into custody.
The accused, when spoken to last night,
declined to make any statemsnt until he
first consulted his attorney. He stated
that he expected bis bruther would secure
his release on bonds before morning. He
did not seem to be much alarmed over the
consequences or the gravity of the charge
against him.
A Cnse of Abduction.
OAKLAND, Cai*. March 12â An un
known man, presumably acting out or
spite, abducted a colored boy named
Enoch from his home two weeks ago.
Dr J M. Shannon, who came here six
rear. aÂ«o from Mississippi, brought the
lad with him, and he never reilized bu
that the doctors children were Ins own
brothers and sisters, and was always
treated as such. To-day the boy was
found at the home of William Jonnson,
2252 Magnolia street, and taken nome. Mb
claims to have been led away by glitter
ing promises, and fora time was in vari
ous downtown resorts and later around the
racetrack. Dr. Shannon thinks he Knows
the stranger, and will make it interesting
for him should he come around.

They Have Frequently Been Assured by the Prison Directors

H THE CALL'S " EXPOSE CAME AS A COMPLETE SURPRIBE
Â» TO THEM.
Labor Union Hen All Over the State Express Disgust and Contempt for
the Hyp< critical F.k-r Who Lately Was So Loud in
Professions of Friendship for Them.
k
f* . After the first flush of surprise and indignation following The Call's exposure of
the duplicity and hypocrisy of the Examiner, workingmen everywhere have adopted
a tone of disgust and contempt in speaking of that monarch of fakers.
Expressions of this kind come to The Call every hour of the day from all parts
of California,' the voluntary utterances of men who feel that they have been duped in
heretofore giving credit to the Examiner's professions of friendship for them.
A. J. Head, ex-president of Alaraeda County Federated Trades, who served three
terms as president of Oakland Typographical Union, speaking of the faker, said yes
. , terday â this is a mere sample of what is heard everywhere: Examiner only
saves about 2 cents per pound on the twine made for that paper in San Quentin, but
. the principle underlying the transaction merits the- condemnation and contempt of
the toiling thousands who have to struggle s?mply to obtain plain food and shelter
for their families. According to the Examiner's teachings, to obtain employment it
1 â¢ may be necessary for workingmen to commit a crime and qualify for State 'prison,
where work will be provided them. Our merchants should realize and protest
against such unfair and unworthy competition. If our convicts are so numerous and
bo deserving of work, let them ba put to work at once in building needed fortifications
for this coast. The rock can be had from our quarries at little or no expense. Such
healthy exercise might also tend to lessen the number of Examiner. convicts, and the
price of twine would then go up to living rates." "â 'â¢'- \ â 'â¢' -"â¢ -'*
It will be seen that to workingmen this is not the trifling matter that the Ex
aminer seeks to make It appear. The workinginan is engaged in a constant struggle
, against the repression and aggression of capital ana monopoly, and one of the princi
pal agents employed by these against him and one which he has had the most diffi
culty in "meeting, is convict labor. It is a most insidious element in his problem, un
dermining the prices of the home market. He has had to contend with it long and hard,
here and everywhere. To him the fight against convict labor, as it comes in competition
â¢with free- labor, is not only a matter of principle, but it is a practical matter touching
the problem of his survival in the struggle of life. â¢ The newspaper that buys convict
made goods through its business office and condemns convict labor in its editorial
columns brands itself as a hypocrite and a thing to be shunned and despised by work
ingmen and all who sympathize with them. . ). 'V
Labor Convention, organized for the purpose of looking after legislation in
the interest of workingmen during the sitting of the Legislature, gave expression to
its sentiments on this subject in the following resolution:
WHEREAS, The question of prison labor and its encroachment
on free labor should receive the attention of this congress without
further delay ; therefore be it
RESOLVED, That we are in favor of submitting to the voters of
this State a constitutional amendment to be voted on at the next gen
eral election abolishing prison labor when such comes in competition
with free labor, and providing that convicts shall be compelled to
work by hand, thereby discontinuing the use of machinery.
A. McDERMOTT.
The frame of fin act was subsequently submitted to the convention for its ap
proval providing that prison-made goods be branded so that they might be recognized
in the market, but the convention, having expressed its disapproval of admitting
such goods to the market at all, declined to recommend the bill.
The manufacturers and producers of San Francisco look upon prison labor as one
of the troubles in their path also, and they join with the workmen in their condem
nation of a newspaper that patronizes a prison to save a few cents, while the free
labor market is clamoring for employment.
J. W. Kerr, at the meeting of the Manufacturers' and Producers' Association held
Thursday evening, speaKing on thiÂ« subject, said: "We find that one of our metro
politan dailies, the San Francisco Examiner, on which we relied for support in com
mon with the others, Is itself a patron of San Quentin. The Examiner, lam slad to
say, has bÂ»en shown up, as it deserves to be."
The employes of the California Cotton Mills deny the Examiner's allegation that
the twine purchased from the prison could not bj procured otherwise than from the
prison in California. Alarmed by the stealthy action of the faker, directly menacing
their livelihood, they yesterday hurriedly dispatched a delegation of their number
with a petition to the Manufacturers' and Producers' Association, protesting against
vhat they term "a gross outra.e that is being perpetrated upon free white labor by
the Examiner and the y>nson."
They declare that they have been employed for six years past in making twine of
similar and better qualities, which are in daily use by other newspapers, and that no
such twine is made in any other penal institution in the United States; that they
have been esaured repeatedly by the Prison Directors and the Warden that the prison
jutemill was being run on grain and sutjar bags <'nly, wdich, they say, would thus re
duce their unfair competition to a minimum, and that it was with great surprise th^y
learced of the establishment of the Examiner twine factory within the prison walls.
They ask the Manufacturers' and Producers' Association to do what it can to put a
stop to it.
California Cotton- Workers Want
the Examiner's Prison Mill Stopped.
Employes of the California Cotton-mills yesterday dispatched a delegation repre
senting them to the Manufacturers' an<i Producers' Association, protesting against
the â  jSxaminer's twineniill in San Quentin and pleading that the association use its
best endeavors to "put a stop to this menance to our livelihood.' 1 The language of
the prqtest is as follows:
To the Officers and Members of tlie Manufacturers' and Producers'
dissociation of California â GENTLEMEN: We, the undersigned delegation,
"^presenting the employes of the California Cotton-mills of Oakland,
where both cotton and jute twines are manufactured, desire to deny the

purchasing from the State prison at San Quentin could not be procured,
made by free white labor, in California, we having been employed in
making twine of similar and better qualities for various firms in San
"Francisco for six years past, said twines being used by many local
newspapers and other firms. Moreover, we desire to state that no such
twine is made in any penal institution in the United States except at
San Quentin, and we were not aware of its being made there until the
recent exposure in the San Francisco CALL, and we protest that it is a
gross outrage that is being perpetrated upon free white labor by the
â¢Examiner and the prison. We have been assured from time to time by
the Board of Prison Directors and the Warden that the prison jutemill
was being run on grain and sugar bags only, which would thus reduce
their unfair competition to a minimum. It was therefore a great sur
.prise to us when the twine-making was revealed.
We would therefore petition the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association to use their utmost endeavors to put a stop to this menace
to our livelihood, and to do all in their power to end this unjust manu
facturing by the State prison.

Should Be Frowned Upon
by All Honest Workingmen.
GRASS VALLEY, CaiÂ», March 12. âJ. J. Ryan, president of the Grass
Valley Miners' Union, when interviews*! by a Call correspondent, was loth to Re
lieve the statements of The Call, but was forced to by the conclusive proofs offered.
"In the face of this," said Mr. Ryan, "I must say that the Examiner has done the
working classes of California an injustice. Honest labor should at all times be given

preference over convict production of any description. Even if advantage in the
way of reduction of price of articles was gained it illy becomes a paper which
champions the rights of the people to go contrary to its teachings."
Frank Rose, a prominent baroer and president of the Barbers' Union of Grass
Valley, does not believe in the patronage of convict labor to the exclusion of honest
labor. "My sentiment in this regard," said Mr. Rose, "are that there has been much
hypocrisy in the policy and methods of the Examiner in its alleged protection of
the rights of the masses. It is in direct oppo.-itiou to its open statements, and
such conduct should be frowned upon by every intelligent and honest workingman.
The jatemills of the State Prison is the last^lace I would expect the Examiner to
patronize after such bold championship of labor."
John Renwick, a foreman at Maryland mine, is utterly opposed to patronage of
convict labor of any description. Be said: "How would the miners of Grass Valley
feel and act should the mine-owners contract for prison labor to work our mines ?
They would rise up in arms and demand protection of honest labor. This applies to
other industries as well, and Thk Call has again showed its loyalty to the working
people by exposing such action as the Examiner is guilty of."
Edward Nathan, a well-known salesman, said he voiced the sentiments of the
retail clerks when he denounced to action of the Examiner in purchasing prison-made
twine. He believed in giving a fair price for such products, although a little in excess
of convict production.
No Mere Sentiment Involved.
It Is a Principle, Vital and Burning.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., March 12.â Many people here read with interest The
Call's disclosure of the Examiner's patronage of convict labor. Following are some
of the expressions touching the matter, picktd up at random, which indicate the
opinion of all whose attention has been attracted to t tie subject:
F. W. Snyder, secretary of the Labor Exchangeâ Such inconsistency on the part
of a daily paper like the Examiner is perfidious, it matters not how little is concerned,
and I think The Call has done well to unearth it. No mere sentiment is involved.
It is a principle, vital and burning. No journal that truly labors for the interests of
the worklngman can practice such hypocrisy. It should be sat upon with vigor. If
we can but half way trust a paper inconsistently upholding the right, which
affects all regardless of sentiment, we should not trust it at all.
Hon. R. W. Gay, a prominent business man and an active friend of the laboring
man â Under no consideration should free labor be brought into competition with
convict labor, and he who encouraged it cannot possibly be a friend to the working-
"It only convinces me more that the Examiner is t!>e most unreliable and un
trustworthy journal to be found anywhere," remarked Joseph Fisk, a well-known
carpenter. '"It is not even reliable to its friends."
Thomas Jefferson Packard â Such practice is not calculated to throw many jewels
into the lap of any institution. We're not all guys.
Frank Buckreus â It is not right. A big paper has too much influence to be
guilty of such two-faced work. We have enough of producers among the free to
patronize without going to the penitentiaries to get what we need.
The Faker's True Character.
The Mask Is Shattered.
WATSONVILLE, Cal., March 12.â M. Valentine, an old resident of this valley,
and who is familiar with all San Francis cy papers and their policies for a number of
years, says: "I consider there is no moral soundness in the Examiner, and has not
been for years."
G. M. Ball, a merchant here, and who is an old printer and who belongs to the
Typographical Union now and has for the past twenty years, says: "I would not con
sider the Examiner worthy of the support of union labor."
Frank J. Murphy, a prominent attorney of this county, and who is familiar with
the policy of the Examiner, says the expose of The Call of the true relation of (be
Examiner to labor is complete and utterly shatters the mask that has so long con
cealed the Examiner's dual character. The laborer should appreciate the fearlessness
and steadfast support of The Call in his interest."
Judge Sam C. Smith of Pajaro, an old Virginia Democrat, says: "If The Call's
statements are correct that the Examiner encouraged the manufacture of twine by
convict labor, when the same could be had that was being manufactured by free
labor, the inconsistency of the Examiner as to its claims in regard to the upholding
of free labor is certainly apparent."
Many other interviews could bo had, but these indicate the line of them all.
These persons give theirs freely and sign the same, so they are authentic
It Is a Snake in the Grass,
an Enemy of Honest Labor.
I'LACERYILLE, Cat,.. March 12. â M. Zimmerman, contractor and builder, says
The Call has advanced the iaboring man's interests in exposing the duplicity of the
Examiner toward the people who struggle for an existence daring these days of finan
cial depression.
Robert Bair, lumber-dealer â The Call is pursuing a good coarse in laying bare
the false assumptions of the Examiner. Posing as a friend it has been really a snake
in the grass, an enemy to honest labor.
John PearsoD, bottling worksâ l glory in the coarse being followed by The Call.
It shows itself the friend of him who battles in daily toil for sustenance. The friend
of the laboring man and buying, twine made by convict labor is rather a ludicrous
position, but quite in keeping with the tactics of that monarch of faker*.
John Dench, saddler â I like the work done in the interest of labor by Thb Call.
It did well to expose the rascality and duplicity of Long Green's damnable policy.
8. G. Beach, contractor and builderâ The Call did well to expose the hypocrisy
of its morning contemporary to the laboring man. It iÂ» difficult enough for an
honest man to gain a lirelinood during these times of financial stress, and it is har
assing to see a daily journal of the metropolis posing as the friend of labor and
patronizing convict labor, thus indirectly closing the door of the factory to honest
labor.
F. F. Barss, jewelerâ The expose by The Call is timely and opportune. The
bread of honest labor is sweet, but labor in a felon's cell patronized in preference to
clamoring and hungry people is nothing less than an outrage upon honesty. Duplicity
in this case was well exposed.
"The Call" Is the Real
Champion of the Workingmen.
FRESNO, Cal., March 12.â A. D. Marshall, president of the State Typographical
Union and foreman in the composing-room of the Morning Republican, considers
that the expose by Thk Call of the Examiner's treachery to labor places the notori
ously faking newspaper in a very Dad light.
"The Examiner has pretended to be the firm friend of the workinprnen, but The
Call has now shown it to be much different," said Mr. Marshall. "The buying of
twine from the prison mills by the Examiner proves it to be other than the frionci of
the workmgman. This instance shows the true spirit of the paper. The case of the
Examiner is a very hypocritical one. Its pretense of friendship while secretly acting
as the enemy of labor shows it to be a hypocritical paper. I makÂ» these statements
E 3ST T TATI IST E ID .
in the assumption that The Call's expose is founded on facts, and I don't think there
can be any question about that. In my position as president of the State Typo
graphical Union I don't care to express myself very extensively, however. I believe
The Call is the true friend of labor, as it has shown itself to be in regard to the
printers. Under the management of Charles M. Shortridge The Call, in my opin
ion, is the strong champion of the workingmen."
Stupefied by the Unmasking
of the Arch Hypocrite.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 12.â The exposure contained in yesterday's Call of
the hypocritical fakers who conduct the San Francisco Examiner relating to their pur
chase of supplies produced by convict labor at San Quentin produced a profound sen
sation among labor unions of this city. It has been the chief topic of discussion in
organized labor circles here to-day. The friends of free labor are utterly dumfounded
over the situation. The Examiner management has concealed its real motives
toward organized labor so cleverly in the past that its advocates are dazed and stupe
fied at the unmasking of the arch hypocrite, humbug and fraud.
Mingled expressions of surprise, regret and indignation were heard here wherever
a squad of organized laborers were at work. The leaders and officers were astounded
at the news, and nearly all of them, when pressed for an expression of views, begged
for more time to consider the remarkable disclosures. Some one had evidently been
the rounds of the unions in behalf of the recalcitrant sheet, promulgating the gratui
tous information that "this is a newspaper fight between the two papers," which
proposition was knocked higher than Gilderoy's kite in the Examiner itself, which con
fessed in an editorial that the charges of The Call were true and practically defied
organized labor by insisting that they had a right to purchase supplies where they
could be secured on the best terms in the iirst place, and pleading in the next that the
amount was small, anyway. As a prominent labor leader said to-day: "The Exami
ner stands convicted by its own utterances. The sum of money involved cuts no
figure at all. If the Examiner can, with impunity and propriety, purchase a few
hundred dollars' worth of twine made by convict labor, it can with equal propriety
buy all the twine and every other product of prison labor in the United States. This
is not the way for a friend of organized labor to express itself.
Laboring men have been ao adroitly and cunningly deceived and the deception
has been pursued so persistently that it is now pretty bard for these men to realize
how great a fraud they have been encouraging and harboring for years. There can
be no doubt, however, that a fatal blow has been struck at the most gigantic bum Dug
and the most arrant faker who ever had the gall to conduct a newspaper.
Cyrus E. Fisk. ez-president of the Council of Lab^r and president of the Labor
Congress of this county, was seen by a Call correspondent here this evening. Mr.
Fisk declared himself a friend of the Examiner and said he was loth to believe that it
had deliberately taken such a step, but when asked how organized laborers felt about
this matter said:
"I do not care to express myself about the issues involved in this jutemiil affair
owing to lack of full information on the subject of the Examiner's alleged purchase,
bat this is true : Organized labor severely condemns the employment of convict labor
in any productive capacity that brings the convicts into competition with free labor.
"Trade unions have done much to eliminate the evil of prison labor, and we feel
as though every newspaper having at heart the welfare of the laboring people should
second our efforts."
The Holier-Than-Thou Faker
Estimated at Its Real Value
BAN DIEGO, Cal., March 12. â Although more than six bundled miles away from
San Francisco the news of the hypocritical action of the Exami ner in purcnasine and
using convict-made twine, as conveyed in The Call's expose, has created considerable
indignation among workingmen and trades unions in this city. Tne position taken
by the Janus- faced monarch in its frantic holier-than-thou editorials concerning the
Grant monument pedestal last May was fresh in the minds of many who were seen
to-day in regard to The Call's expose.
Harry Clark, a well-known printer, and president of the Federate.! Trades of this
city, said:
"It strikes me as very hypocritical on the part of the Examiner, which has always
posed as the friend of organized labor, and certainly very inconsistent when one re
members but a few months ago that this same journal was working itself into a fine
frenzy over a block of granite made in a prison 3000 miles away. At the meeting of
the Federated Trades Thursday nizht the attention of Mr. Hearst will certainly be
called to this matter."
Alderman George H. Spears, ex-president of the Federated Trades: "It seems
mighty small business 10 me. . A paper tbst has for years talked for organized labor
and howled against prison labor. It seems as though one can hardly know whom to
trust. The Examiner has always been considered opposed to the very thing it
appears to have been practicing in secret."
Alderman Joseph Bacbman, a prominent member of the Order of Railway Con*
ductor<: "AH labor organizations have for years bitterly fought the introduction of
prison-made goods everywhere. The Examiner has advocated this course time and
again, and now it comes to the surface that they have been buying prison goods
themselves. If it is true, the Examiner is no paper for the workingman to take."
A. C. Crane, a prominent printer: "Very hypocritical and inconsistent. It
seems the Examiner, like some others in this world, has been preaching one thins
while practicing another, and The Call has been smart enough to tind it out."
It Can't Justify Its Action
In the Eyes of Workingmen.
SANTA ANA, Cal., March 12.â C. P. Durfee, a well-known shoemaker of this
city, who has resided here for the past ten years, when questioned by a Call repre
sentative as to his opinion of the Examiner's experiment with convict twine, said:
"The Examiner has certainly placed itself in a very inconsistent position before
workingmen, and I hardly see how it can expect to justify its action in giving convict
labor a preference to honest men in making its twine, for every pound of twine made
within the prison walls means a corresponding loss to laborers outside of them. It is
all well enough for the convicts to be made self-supporting, but through the Exam
iner they have been brought into actual competition with honest laborers of the
Sta te."
"High Time to Withdraw Support."
CHICO, Cal., March 12.â The Call's article exposing the Examiner's purchase of
convict-labor material set quite an interesting subject for conversation agog in Chico.
The Call is always the champion of right, ana when it attacks a contemporary, espe
cially on a question of this kind, it adds laurels to its already goodly store. Many of
the workingraen who were interviewed to-day in regard to the step The Call has
taken spoke in commendatory terms regarding the same, and heartily condemn the
Examiner. It has been a noticeable fact that in this vicinity three-quarters of all the
grain bags used are the product of convict labor. Notwithstanding the fact that time
and rime again the workingmen have protested apainst the patronage of such a detri
mental product it still goes on, and when a paper such as the Examiner purports to
be deliberately purchases and consumes the product of convict labor it is high time
for the laboring and business class of a community to withdraw ttieir support from
such a paper, which deliberately sinks them lower in the toils of monopoly.
Workmen Open
Their Eyes.
VALLEJO, Cal., March 12.â A number
of worfcingmen interviewed are of the
opinion that The Call is pnrsuing the
just course in its exposition of the methods
of the Examiner in procuring their twine
from the result of convict labor and in
their opening the eyes of the laboring men
and others in California and letting them
know that the practice pursued by the so
called "monarch of the dailies" is of no
benefit to the workingmen of this coast,
whose Interest it has so oft claimed it
is espousing. It is their earnest wish that
The Call will expose all persons engaged
in the practice of procuring articles of any
kind brought in competition with free
labor.
Pretending to Be
Their Friend.
GILROY, Cal., March 12.â The news of
the perfidy of the San Francisco Ex
aminer in baying convict-made goods in
preference to those of union labor was re
ceived here with indignation and surprise.
That a paper pretending to be the friend
of the workingman should for the sake of
saving a few cents on the pound for twine
be caught contracting for prison-made
goods and forget its duty to the working
man meets with hearty disapproval and'
condemnation. The prominent working
men and mechanics of Gilroy uphold the
stand of The Call in tne interest of tbe
laborers and manufacturers of the State
in unmasking Hearst's hypocrisy. E. H.
Farmer and other prominent citizens
agree that it is a crying shame to thus
disregard the laboring men by placing
them in competition with convict labor.
Underwriters Dine and Talk.
An informal meeting and banquet of mem
bers of the Underwriters' Association of t-au
Francisco was h.'ld last night at the Occiden
tal Hotel. About twenty persons were present.
The association is compo^d of managers 01
life Insurance companies In this City. Clar
ence M. Smith, president of the association,
sat at tbe head of the table. John Landers
gave interesting reminiscences of his experi
ence in "writing n\>" different risks: Fred

himself to some vivid personal experiences;
C. A. McLane humorously explained how he
by accident had pot into the insurance basi
nets, and Major J. B. Day read a paner on
â¢'Underwriters' Associations." The dinner
was a pleasant affair.

SATURDAY .....V....MARCII 13, 1897
During the week ending Sat-
urday last THE CALL published
-3=o 1 S inches .
of advertisements, which is
QQ4L inches more
than was published by any other
San Francisco newspaper during
the same time.
Enforce the law.
Brins the rascals to punishment
The jute-goods act must be obeyed.
The fakers are very close to jail now.
Hypocrites should not be allowed to
dodee statutes.
Every citizen is interested when the
laws are broken and statutes defied.
No friend of free labor prefers prison
made gooJs to those made by free labor.
T,ong Green Lawrence out on bail only
gives a larger exposure to the convicted
liar.
Provisions of the law for the protection
of free lab jr cannot be evaded with impu
nity.
L*eave orders for The Sunday Call to
day and make sure of good reading for
to-morrow.
Greece may not be running a bluff on
the powers, but sue is certainly leading
them to the pre c pice.
It is not correct to say that Long Green
Lawrence crawied into a hole on the
bribery charge. He was kicked in.
"True, we use convict poods and vio
lated the law to obtain them," says the
Examiner, "but that is a small thing."
Every member of tne Caban committee
of fifty-eight should attend the committee
meetin to be held this evening at Cali
fornia Hall.
In claiming that its use of prison-made
supplies is but a small thing, the Examiner
is right enough in one respect It is truly
a small business.
The patron of prison-made goods de
fends himself by belittling home indus
tries, and thus does a double injury to tne
work of free labor.
Why do the authorities at San Quentin
require :armer.-< to make affidavits when
tbey desfre to purchase jutebags and then
allow the Examiner to evade the law?
Free labor, which condemns the use of
prison-made supplies in competition with
home industri- ?, should make the con
demnation felt forcibly and promptly.
The clause of the law requiring affidavits
from all purchasers of jute goods from
State prisons was enacted for the protec
tion of free labor, and its violation is a
direct injury to that labor.
Buying cheap prison-made twine for th?
sake of saving 2 cents a pound is but a
poor sort of economy, but Wasteful Willie
squanders so much at the bung in New
York that be must save at the spigot in
San Francisco.
If the Examiner sincerely believed that
Its use of convict-made supplies was right,
why did it not procure them openly and
in a lawful way? Why did it think it
necessary to ac the sneak and take the
risks of violating the law?
Lottery advertisemems, false dispatches,
fake sensations, foul slanders, criminal
stories and prison-made supplies make up
the composition known as yellow-dog;
journalism. Is it any wonder it is beirlg
excluded from public libraries, clubs and
homea?
The attempt to hold in New York a
mass-meeting to support the proposed
arbitration treaty with Great Britain was
anything but a fizzle. Unfortunately for
the promoters of the treaty, however, the
explosion went the wrong way and blew
them sky high.
The cause of American citizens sub
jected to Spanish despotism in Cuba is,
In a broad sense, the cause of ail Ameri
cans. All members of the committee ap
pointed hv Mayor Phelan to advance that
cause should attend the committee meet
ing this evening. The time for action has
come, and every man should be at his
post. -
The Ways and Means Committee of the
House of Representatives have settled the
wool schedules of the new tariff Dy adopt
ing virtually the McKinley rates. This
settlement will probably be satisfactory to
both the growers and the manufacturers.
Those rates promoted the wool industry
before and it is reasonable to assume they
will do so again.
The law of California requires that all
orders for jute goods from the State
prison whsre they are made shall be ac
companied by an affidavit subscribe i and
sworn to before a notary public or a Jus
tice of the Peace residing in the township
where the applicant resides. In order to
keep its deal in convict goods secret the
Examiner made no affidavit and thus vio
lated the law. It is now for the State
officials and the criminal courts to decide
whether this violation ol the law is a
small tiling.
THE VIOLATED LAW.
The statute of the State which the Examiner violated in order to obtain prison
made supplies is not one about which there can be any honest difference of opinion.
The terms are too clearly stated to admit of misconception or mistake. The law says:
All orders for jute goods must be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth that the amount
of goods contained in the order is for the individual and personal use of the applicant, said
affidavit to be subscribed and sworn to before some Notary Public or a Justice of the Peace
residing In the township in which the applicant resides.
The supplies obtained by the Examiner from San Quentin prison were jute goods.
There is no question on that point. It is clear that they could be lawfully obtained
only by making the required affidavit. Such affidavit was not made. Warden Hale
admits that no affidavit was made. The Examiner, therefore, in its effort to obtain
prison-made supplies secretly and without the knowledge of the public, violated the
law and succeeded in inducing the prison authorities to connive at the violation.
The only defense of the Examiner is that the amount of goods obtained is small.
This defense is not valid in any respect. If it sincerely believed that the purchase of pris
on-made supplies was rightful, it would not have taken the risk of violating the law in
order to keep the transaction secret from the public. It was well aware that it was
doing a wrong to free labor, and on consideration believed it would be better to violate
the law by a sneak rather than to face pubiic opinion by acting openly.
The clause in the statute which requires an affidavit from all would-be purchasers
ot jute goods was designed for the express purpose of protecting free labor
from the competition of convicts. When the question of the manufacture of
such goods in State prisons was before the Legislature it was debated whether it
would be advisable to undertake it. After full consideration the Legislature decided
to permit the manufacture in order to provide the farmers of California with grain
bags and sacking-twine on torrus that would enable ihem to compete fairly with the
farmers of other localities. It was recognized, however, that this concession to
farmers involved some danger to free labor, and to guard against that danger the
clause requiring tue affidavit from purchasers was inserted in the act.
It will be seen that in evading the clause which requires affidavits to accompany
all orders for jute goods from the State prison the Examiner has violated that part of
the statute which was intended to protect free labor. It has committed a misde
meanor in doing so, for the law expressly declares "any applicant, as heretofore pro
vided for, who falsely and fraudulently procures jute goods under the provisions of
this act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."
THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE.
The Call published yesterday a summary of the voices of the people condemning
the Examiner for violating the law of California in order to obtain prison-made
supplies for use in its office. It was impossible for us to give anything more than a
summary. Had w* undertaken to report in full the. indignation of the people it
would have required every column of every page of The Call to do so.
The summary given was sufficient to show the prevailing sentiment of the people
in all parts of the State. Julian Sonntag, president of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association, said: "Any person or persons, company or corporation
purchasing convict goods should be condemned in the fullest sense of the word. It
is an injury to all free men of the State. It is a menace to capital and a menace
to labor."
These words sum up the substance of the offense. They were indorsed by work
ingmen and capitalists from all parts of California. President Rogers of the Alameda
County Federation of Trades said : "The action of the Examiner is severely condemned
by us all." C. F. Decker of Red Bluff, who was long the active head of the Knights
of Labor, said: "The working people know the Examiner has never been a friend to
labor and are glad to see such an expose as has been made by The Call," Frank
Mather, a p eminent cigar manufacturer of Santa Rosa, says: ''Its buying prison
made goods while loudly chanting its own praises as a friend of free labor is a
detestable offense."
The workingmen of Sacramento were clear and decided in condemning the course
of the paner. One of them said: "I have taken the Examiner for years because I was
a Democrat and always felt an interest in politics, but this settles it. I quit" Samuel
Hughes of Typographical Union No. 21 said: "As a union man I can do-nothing else
but denounce the Examiner." Many others spoke with a like force and directness.
In San Jose the demonstrations were equally strong. A. B. McNeil, proprietor of
an extensive job-printing establishment in that city, said: "Speaking as an employer
of organized labor, and as one whose entire interests are identified with the welfare of
the Pacific Coast, I will say that I know of no action as insidious in its character and
as far reaching in its effects as this throttling of labor by the purchase of prison
made goods." A. T. Huston, president of the Barbers' League, said: "The Examin
er's excuse for purchasing prison-made twine is a lame one. This is not a small mat
ter. There is a great principle involved. The purchase of such prison-made goods as
enter into competition with free labor prevents honest men from getting work."
From Salinas come expressions strong and vigorous. W. E. Grant, contractor
and builder, says: "The Examiner is not the workingman's friend. No convict labor
for me." H. E. Bessett, carpenter, says: "No paper that uses the produce of convict
labor can be a friend to the wage-earner." A. T. Uncapher said: "Since the expos
ure in The Call I know the Examiner is the enemy of honest labor."
T.ius from all parts of the State and from all classes of people engaged in industry
there come words of support to the statement that the action of the Examiner in using
prison supplies is a menace to capital and a menace to labor. We cannot quote them
all, nor is it necessary to do so. The voice of public indignation can and will make
itself heard to an extent beyond the power of The Call to reproduce. The peopie of
California believe in home industry, and they will not condone as a small thing the
action of the Examiner in using prisou-made supplies, and then defending itself by
belittling home industries and Jibclinc home products with the assertion that free
labor in California does not produce supplies equally good to those obtained from
prisons.
THE SALINAS ENCAMPMENT.
The preparations now being made at
Salinas for the annual encampment of the
Department of California and Nevada of
the Grand Army of the Republic give as
surance that this assembly of the veterans
will be held under circumstances propi
tiou3 to enjoyment in every respect.
Few localities in California have more
attractions than Salinas, and no part of
ihe State has a fresher beauty or more de
lightful climate in the month of April,
when the encampment is to be held. Na
ture will do everything to make the occa
sion a delightful one, and the veterans
will meet under circumstances as different
as possible from those which surrounded
them in the hard days of war, where their
friendships were first established and the
patriotic deeds performed which have
made them friends forever.
It will not be upon nature only, how
ever, that the members of the Grand
Army may depend for the success of their
encam ; raen.t. Salinas is not a large town,
but the people have large ways. They are
genuine Californians in hospitality and in
loyal love ol the brave men who preserved
the Union. They will devise a thousand
means of manifesting their welcome to the
veterans, ana when the old soldiers gather
there they will find themselves at home
among their friends.
The advantages of the encampment will
not be wholly on the Bide of the veterans.
Salinas will profit much by the entertain
ment she gives and the hospitality which
she extends. These gatherings of the sol
diers of tiie war invariably attract public
attention, and as a re-Suit Salinas will be
largely in the thong its of the people of
California during the whole time of the
encampment. This cannot fail to redound
to her benefit.
The advantages sha offers for home
seekers and for men who have capital to
invest are many. It is only necessary
that attention should be called to them in
order that a considerable number of tour
ists may be attracted to the city. When
t c visitor has seen Salinas he will not
need much argument to convince him
that it is a good place to settle and a good
place to invest money. The hosts as well
as tne guests of the coming encampment
may therefore look forward to it with
pleasure, and we congratulate both on the
prospects before th- m.
Enforced economy brought about by a
failing business may be an excuse for the
nrchase of cheap prison twine by the
Examiner, but what is the excuse for vio
lating the law in obtaining it?
We can now understand why the Exam
iner was opposed to the construction of
the new Federal building. The work is
not to be done by prison labor.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 13, 1897.
THE NEW TARIFF.
The Ways and Means Committee of the
House of Representatives is making rapid
progress in the work of constructing the
new tariff, and there is reason to believe
the bill will not only be ready to report
soon after the new Congress is organized,
but will be in its main points entirely
satisfactory to Congress and to the coun
try.
There is some cause for fear, however,
that trie fruit industry may not be as well
protected as it merits. It is well, there
fore, that the people of California and
their delegation in Congress should kesp
a vigilant watch on the fruit schedules.
According to reports the East has not yet
learned the importance of protecting Cali
fornia raisinÂ«-growers from the competi
tion of the so-called Zante currants. This
is understood in Fresno, and efforts are
now being made to procure a duty on
these goods which will afford the required
protection. In this work the people of
Fresno should have the cordial support of
all Californians, and can certainly count
on that of the people, the press and the
commercial bodies of San Francisco.
It is also urged that a fuller protection
shonld be t-iven to citrus fruits. In addi
tion to the competition which already ex
ists in Southern Europe and the West
Indies, ttiere is an increasing competition
from Mexico. The Mexican growers of
citrus fruits would be most dangerous
competitors to California, and it is only
right that Congress should give a protec
tion sufficient to guard our orange and
lemon growers against the rivalry of a
country where land and labor are so much
cheaper.
Another feature of the tarifl which will
be of importance to Californiansis the duty
on wool. These schedules have been acted
on by the Ways and Means Committee and
the results seem to be fairly satisiactory.
The rates adopted are in the mnin those
which were provided by the McKinley
bill, and, as these were beneficial daring,
the continuance of that tariff, it is reason
able to assume that they will be equally
beneficial now. Nevertheless, it must be
remembered that the conditions of the
world have changed in the last four years
and that tne country requires to-day
a much higher protection in some lines
than it required before the universal de
pression began.
When the bill is reported it will come
before the people as well as before Con*
gress for criticism. Until that time all
comment upon it must be made in a ten
tative way. The framers of the bill hare
to adapt it to tne double purpose of pro
tecting American industry and of pro
viding a revenue for the country. It will
not be fair to criticize the bill from either
of these points of view alone. It will rep
resent the best judgment of Republican
ljadors and true protectionists and is
therefore entitled to favorable considera
tion. Nevertheless, it behooves the people
to watch every step in the progress of the
measure with.great care. We have many
industries and interests which differ from
those of the East and we must look after
them ourselves, for no otheis will.
TEE ARBIi RATION TREATY.
A mass-meeting in Now York called to
support the proposed arbitration treaty
with Great Britain resulted In a vote ad
verse to the resolutions of those who
called it. Though speakers of eminence
and eloquence were on hand to advocate
the treaty, the honors of the meeting were
won by an orator who rose from the audi
ence to denounce the measure.
The incident serves to show how strong
is ihe popular feeling against any move
ment which seems to commit this country
to submit all its possible controversies
with Great Britain to an arbitration which
might he controlled by some foreign
fower. This feeling, which is natural to
Americans, has been intensified by the
conduct of the Cleveland administration,
and particularly by the speeches of Bay
ard. It is, therefore, more adverse to the
treaty now than it would be under ordi
nary conditions, and it is certain there
would be little regret oraong the great
mass of the people if the treaty should be
refused ratification by the Senate.
It muÂ«t be borne in mind, however, that
a new administration has come into
power. McKinley is not Cleveland, ana
Bayard will soon cease to misrepresent
the United States at the Court of St.
James. With a more resolute American
ism in power at Washington the popular
confidence in the conduct of our foreign
affairs will increase and, consequently,
the opposition to the treaty will be largely
diminished.
It is not likely that the terms arranged
by Olney will be accepted. Important
amendments to the instrument will be
made by the new Secreiary of State. We
shall have the Monroe doctrine guarded
against submission to arbitration and our
control of the coming Nicaragua canal
will be assured. Under such conditions
the treaty will be more acceptable to the
people. In the meantime the New York
protest shows clearly how strong is tbe
public feeling against the measure as pro
posed by the Clev land administration
and bow resolute is the popular desire to
defeat it

Populists Denounce Fusion.
Editor San Francisco Callr-Bm: It is a matter of more general importance than may at
first be apparent that the Memphis meeting of tbe National Press Association of Populist
editors and publishers undertook to define the attitude of the People's party on fusion.
The convention was in session three days, February 22, 23 and 24, was very spirited and
earnest, but remarkably harmonious. An ab:e committee on address to the Popuasts of the
United States was appointed early in the session, and this address, adopted just before
adjournment without a dissenting vote, defines the Httitude of the masses of the party beyond
a doubt, and is worthy of serious attention by all good citizens regardless of party.
After charging he leaders of tbe Democratic party with "failure to carry out their promises
by which they secured the indorsement of their candidate for President, thereby causing the
defeat of the reform lorces," and claiming that this "serves as a warning that no reliance can be
placed in such pledges," they yet declare that they "realize that to achieve practical reform
we must have the assisianc â  of every man who loves his country and defends the right."
On the subject of fusiou they make this declaration : "We strenuously oppose all fusion or
entangling alliance with any otlier political party, and we declare to the 'boys in the trenches'
who are looking to us for new hope and encouragement and to the whole country that we will
never furl our flag nor fight under the banner of either of the two old polit c*l parties."
Tnere is marked significance in what they say concerning transportation companies.
Probably a large majority of the people will agree with them. They make this arrnignment:
"We call special attention to the fact that the grea railroad corporations of the country have
been freely and openly used during poiiticnl campaigns by the money power ot tne two con
tinents as oue of the niost powerful aud effective ageucies iordeieating promised financial
reform."
Surely there is (rood ground for their conclusion that, in view of this "active and perni
cious conduct" on the part of such corporations, "the pftblic ownership and operation of the
transportation lines of the country, as demanded by the People's party, is not only necessary
to secure lower and more equitably .transportation rates, but it is al-o absolutely essential to
enable the p-ople to secure financial reform and to preserve popular government."
Urging the necessity of a vigorous campaign of education and a "thorough discussion of
tne qu-.-stion ot direct legis-ation as contemplated in the initiative and referendum," they re
new "the recommendation unanimously made one year ago by this association that tue nor.
iuterest bond plan be made a subject or general discussion."
I pass by other matters in tb< address as formulated by the committee to note some addi
tions made by the association. "We recommend that our National committee be convened not
later that May 1, 1897, for the purpose of calling a general delegate conference of our party to
define our future policy and strengthen the ranks of reform tor tne impending conflict,"
' and a committee of neven wa; appointed to confer with ihe National committee, clothed with
authority to call for sucn n National conference if the National committee fails to act. The
association also "Resolved mat jio proxies shall hereafter be recognized in People's part*
conventions or committees, " tuid "that we reaffirm our approval ol the resolution oi tbe
Omaha convention that no office-holder shall be eligible as delegates to our conventions,"
which was amended to include candidates also, and then adopted.
A smali boiling faction held a meeting at Kansas City at the same time of the Memphis
meeting and organized a ''union" association favorable to fusion arrangements, but only
half a dozen or le^s ot the oid associations affiliated with it, the National secretary. J. A.
Edgerton, who participated in the proceedings, fin->hy declining to Join it, on the ground that
it might tend to a division of tr.e Popu ist lorces. T c new a>sociatiou is practically composed
of a small number of fusion editors who have â¢ o influence witu Popu ists.

the l name â  of the first day of the week, is de
rived from tne Snxon Sunnan daeg, or day of

The. jews and one sect of i Christians observe
baturday as the Sabbath, while the other
Christian denominations observe the first day '
or Sunday, of each week as the Sabbath. Both :
Jews and Christians' ; claim special authority
from the } fourth commandment *of he deca
logue, familiar â  called 1 the Ten Command
ments. This law.was; founded; upon the fact
that in six days { the "} Lord made the world and
rested on the seveuth day, and hence directed
that each seventh day should' thence. orw,.rd
be observe., s a * ' a ho.y day. The i first record
of its observance by tne Jews 'is \ mentioned
il- ; ?us * vi:23 ">â *" ;in â  addition â¢; to
nn^n Jl c observea =in S remembrance sof >, the
original rest day of creation, it was ce.ebrated
also m memento of the day of ireedom of the
Jews from Ky p V Hn ! bondage. There ; can ibe
nÂ« doubt about ' its meaning in th- Old Testa
ny Jll hi I I Â« tlal " teildedaÃft principal testimony
of faith in he Creator of the universe. Tho-e
who keep the flrit day of tne week as Sabbath
argue that there is no proof that the Jewish
count actually began on the seventh day from
I
the creation; that as the Jews made it a me
mento "of the creation, and of their liberation
Jrom bondage, so Chn-tians may well observe
it week y on me day when the ressurection oi
the Me->sinn look pl.ic-. There is no definite
imormation as to when the observance o. the
firÃtdayof ihe week was substituted b ha
Christians ior the .seventh diy, the ancient
Jewish Sabb th. It undoubt dly arose a:uong
the ear iesi practices of the Christian church,
and was. regard d as the fittest day to be he.d
us sacred because, as lias been said. "It is tho
day on which God changed darkness ami
mater and ma c th' world, and ou the samo
day, also, Jesus i hrist, our Savior, rose from
the dead." Tue fir^t law, ci ther ecclesiastical or
civil, by whicn the sabbatliica observance of
Sundiiy is known to have been nriai'ied, is t,u
edict of Constantine, A. D. 321, "forr>iddin?
all work but necessary husbandry on the ven
erable Sunday." In n-e Theodosian code it is
enjoin' d thai "on the. Sunday rightfully
designated by our ancestors as tnp Lord'^ day
all lawsuits and pub. ic busi'ies-s shall cease."
tmce the ninth century Sunday has been a
thoroughly established day oi the Christian
Church as a day of rest and reheious exer
cise, and one exempt from any occupations of
a pure.y secular character, except such as wera
absolutely noce-sary.

The old-timers who came around the
Horn in the fifties have a viv:d recollec
tion of the old dinner Andrew Jackson.
Many a fast trip did she make, and {he saii
ing vessels of to-day would beglid to equal
ncr performances. The last time she en
tered, the Golden Gate was on October 3,
1867. Oa that occasioL she had a large
passenger Ist and a full cargo of general
merchandise aboard. Since that time she
has gone down the scale, and at the pres
ent time is doing duty as a coal huik in
Boston harbor.
When the Andrew Jackson was last
here, the late Mr. Wheeland, of Collins &
"Wbeeland, had a picture of her made. A
.ew days ago his orot er was overhauling
his effects a:id discovered the drawing. It
was nothing but a roll of mildewed can
vas, but as >ovn as Captain ErÂ«kine, the
well-known pilot, saw It, he at once recog
uizeu the si. .p. It shows the old Clipper
hove to, witii" the pilot- boat Caleb Curtis
putting a ;iilot aboar I. The pilot-boat
Fannie, which was then "No. 0," is shown
in the distince. The Fannie has long
since been broken up, and the Caleb Cur
tis, after being turned into a sealer, was
lost, a coup/c of years ago on the coast of
Japan. The pilot who brought her into
port is dead and buried, and all that is
left a* a renrnder of the above scene is the
old hull now doing duty as a coal barge in
JJos.on harbor.
The recent northwester was farreaching.
Vessels uiont the coast suffered and some
of them, like the Christina Steffens, had
to put back to porl. The gasoline
-chooner Mary C, bound from here for
Point Reyes end Bodega, broke tier pro
peiier shaft, but managed to make jiort
and land ncr cargo. Captain d>mpbell
had to beat his way back to San Francis
co, but says i: was a terrible experience.
Two out of every three seas broke over the
little vessel and nearly buried her. Sne
managed to make port again yesterday
and wul go on the drydock tor repairs to
day.
The bark Vidette, from Everett for San
Francisco, had to put back to PortAn
eeles for repairs. She was loaded with
iumoer and general merchandise, ana
after passing Flattery was caught in the
gale and sprang a leak. She will have to
discharge and be repaired before making
another start south.
The cÃp.ain of the Czarina will have a
iale to tell when he gets back here. The
big coilier left Here for Coos Bay several
days ago and as she was flying lignt the
gale had it all its own way. Finally the
captain put about and ran under the lee
of U?aL Tnere he came to au anchor and
awaited the subsidence of the storm.
Capiain ffred Derrick, the popular
master of tbd schooner Gotama. was mar

BRIEF COURTSHIP
OF AN AGED MAN
Mrs. Laura Milen James'
Suit for a $30,000
Estate.
She Claims A'l the Property
for Herself and H?r
In.'ant Child.
Heirs at L w M .king a L ga! Straggle
to Show That She Is Not
the Widow.
In Judge Coffey's court the Dr. Charles
A. James will contest is nearing a cloie.
All the testimony has been presented to
the court and the lawyers are now making
their arguments.
The circumstances of this case are un
u ually romantic and interesting.
Dr. James died in this City on the 28th
of January, 1895, and to the surprise of his
old a( quaintances, a woman claiming to
be the widow of the deceased appeared
upon the scene. Tne snows of sev
enty winters had whitened the ven
erable beard of Dr. James, while his puta
tive wife had not seen more than eighteen
bright summers.
The lady said that her maiden name
was Laura Milen, that ahe was the daugh
ter of Dr. Milen of San Jose, and so
through the trial she has been called Mrs.
Laura Milen James, by her attorneys,
while the lawyers on the other hand have
referred to her as Mis* Laura Milen, some*
times called Mrs. James.
She based her ngnt to the name of wife
and widow on a document which purports
to be a marriage contract signed by her
self and Dr. James, and it is about this
paper that the most bitter controversy
has raped during the forty-nine days that
nave been devoted to this trial.
Mrs. James was a witness in her own
behalf, and told a remarkable story of love
at first sight, the susceptible affections of
an old man and the responsive love of a
confiding girl.
Ou the 6tn of January, 1895, she says,
they were married. He died on the 28th
of January, three weeks later. Her cbiJd
was born September 16, 1895, which was
seven months and ten days alter her mar
riage. She introduced expert medical tes
timony to show that the birth was prema
ture; some of the physicians expressing
the opinion that the sorrow of the mother
might have nad that effect.
Attorney W. H. H. Hart made the fur
ther point that Mrs. James wm caused a
great deal of suffering and mental torture
by the fact that she was accused of poison
ing her husband, and tnat bis body was
disinterreu in order that the contents of
the stomach of the dead man might be
analyzed. He argued that this anguish of
the mind would necessarily have a bad
effect on Mrs. James, with the result in
dicated.
On the other hand, Attorney George D.
Shariburne introduced witnesses to prove
that Miss Laura Milen, sometimes called
Mrs. James, was in the habit of associ
ating with fast young men, actors and
music-ball performers, and sought to
establish the fact that her relations with
them were not what they ought to have
been. Mr. Shadhurne produced a witness,
the keeper of a lodging-house, who swore
that Mrs. James and her stepmoihor and
sister wore lodging in her house in thi*
City, and i bat on the night of the 14th of
Decenibsr, 1894, they went out in the early
part oi the evening and between 11 and 12
o'clock at night returned with three men,
who remained with them till the next
morning.
In regard to the grief of tlie widow, Mr.
Shadburne offered the testimony of some
wno were present, to prove that Mrs.
James did not weep at the death scene,
aud that she manifested no grief at the
luneral. One witness said that the only
remark of the so-called widow immediately
after Dr. James passed away, was tnat she
would "never forget the iace he made as
he died."
Dr. Milen, father of Mrs. James, testified
that his daughters' mental and moral
culture had been relegated by him to their
fctepmoiher. This gave Mr. Snadburn a
chance to prove that the stepmother, Mrs.
Milen, was an improper person to act as a
guardian of virtue,, but was calculated to
corrupt the morals of a young girl. To
prove this, he introduced in evidence a
novel called "The Temptress, or Wai He
to Blame?" So vile was this book that it
was inteidicted by the Society for the
Suppression of Vice, and all copies that
ecu d be found were seized and burned.
Mrs. Milen acknowledged with a show
of literary pride that sho was- the au'bor
of the work, but declared she never showed
it to her step-daughter, Mrs. James.
The claimant, Mrs. James, who demands
half or the $30,000 estate for herself and
the remaining half for her child, wai a
good witness on her own behalf. Her
appearance in court made a lavorable
impression on ail who heard her. She
also presented a multitude of witnesses to
refute the stories told against her and to
prove her good character and the parity
of her life.
Attorney O. W. Fox opened the argu
ment for the c'aimaat, lie made a strong
plea for his client, asserting that the
opposition bad not been able to shave the
firm foundation of his client's position,
and said thut if Dr. James were here de
feuding a suit for breach of promise he
would be stoppKi in his defense in the
face of the conclusive evidence presented
by Mrs. JaniÂ»s.
Attorney Aylette R. Cotton also spoke
feelingly for the putative widow. He
said she bad been subjected to every in
sult and indignity that the ingenuity of
the opposition could devise. After pro
pounding tbe grounds of his client's
claim, he exclaimed: 80 we start out
in this case with circumstances consti
tuting a hypothesis perfect in its pro
portions and paragonal in its probabil
ity."
lie said that a cloud of witnesses bad
testified to the fondness of Dr. Jame for
the little woman who afterward became
his wife by contract. He did not think
the briefness of the courtship cut any fig
ure. The testimony in regard to substan
tial gifts from Dr. James to tie claimant
showed that he regarded her as his wife.
He gave her shoes, stockings and under
clothing and silk dresses. He argued
that no man would give a woman under
clothing unless be regarded her as his
wife, or intended to make her such.
To this line of argument Attorney Sbad
burne responded that Dr. James never
gave theclotbes to Miss Laura Milen,some
times called Mr?. James, but that he sold
them to her just as be sold other clothing
to her stepmother. The clothing belonged
to Dr. James' dead wife, Mr. Shadburne
said, and the doctor had tried to sell the
unices to other women in the case, but
they refused to buy.
Mr. Sbatiburne denounced the so-called
marriage contract as a forgery and read
tbe testimony of one witness who showed
that the pretended signature of Dr. James
wu>s a tracing. Ht said that the contract
was put in Dr. James' desk after tbe
paver- bad been searched through and
examined by Mr. Clam and Attorney Her
rin, neither of whom saw the paper, for
the very good reason that it was not there
when Dr. Jamei died.
He wanted to know what Pr. James
would bo doing with the marriage con
tract if one existed. In the Sharon case
and other cases the Supreme Court had
decided that a marriage contract is pre
sumably for the protection of the woman
in the case. Here the mutter was re
versed. What protection did Dr. James
want that he should take the marriage
contract and lock it In bis desk? He de
nounced the entire suit as an audacious
attempt by sirens and adventuresses to
defraud the rightful heirs ol tbe deal
man, bis nephews and nieces, for whom
he had great affection, who would b* left
without a cent if the villainous scheme
should succeed.
Attorney Hart argued try case on be
half of Mrs. James lest nlÂ«ht, beginning
at 7 o'ciock, a special session of the court
Deing granted for that purpose. Mr. Hart
denounced Mr. Sbadburne's declarations
and insinuations as false, and thought
tbat bis summing of the case had been
weak and illogical.
WANTS HER MANDOLIN.
A Young Woman Charges Justice Car
roll With Keeping an Instrument
bhe Placed in His Care.
A rather curious case was tried before
the Grand Jury yesterday. It came up
on a communication filed by Miss A.
Gibbon.
Miss Gibbon charged Justice of the
l J eace Carroll with retaining, to his own
use and benefit, a mandolin which she had
placed in his care and keeping pending
the disposition of a suit at law brought
against her for its recovery by the person
from whom she had purchased it.
She sot fortti in the communication that
she bought the mandolin from her
teacher, Professor Signor G. Cipolloni;
that iis price Wi $130; that she had partly
paid tor it when the professor brought
3Utt against her to recover the instru
ment. Tbat was a year ago. The case is
now pending before Judge Cook, but the
attorneys on neither side show any dispo
sition to bring the case to trial and the
case showÃ sign' of drawing indefinitely.
In the meantime Miss Gibbon covets
her mandolin, and has sought Justice
Carroll to return it to her, but he has re
fused, declaring he is responsible to the
court for its keeping until the case is de
cided. He responded to the call of the
Grand Jury to explain tho matter yester
day, and took the mandoiin with him.
Miss Gibbon was out of the City, and
therefore did not have a chance to tell her
end of the story, but will be heard next
Tuesday.
PRICE OF WINE RAISED.
An Advance of 5 Cent* a Gallon Made
by the Winemakers' Cor
poration.
A meeting of the California Wine Cor
poration was held yesterday in the Cham
ber of Commerce rooms and tho price of
wine was advanced from 15 to 20 cents per
gallon. The corporation is composed of
nearly 800 members, and the proposed ad
vance had been under consideration for
some time past.
The first business taken up was the old
right with the Wine Association, in which
the corporation sued the association for
$30,000 alleged to be due for wine sola the
association during the past year. The
correspondence was read relativ- to the
matter an â  i tue action was indorsed. The
matter of dissolving the old contract with
the association was left with the board of
directors with power to act.
After a little discussion it was decided
to raise the price of wine 5 cent*, also to
secure storage in this Ci<y where memrers
can store their stock. It is tne intention
of the corporation to tit np a storehouse
at a cost of about $10,000, and at the re
quest of Vice- President Rossi it was de
' cided to advocate a return to the Mc
; Kinley tariff on wines as b?inp for the
, best interests of the wine men of the State.
FRENCH ARTISTS
IN "TROVATORE"
The Second N : gbt of the
Opera Season a
Success.
_ __ __ i
Prevost's High Notes Bring
Down the House â A Fine
Contraltro.
The Company Has Rested From Its
Jcurney and tbe Singers Are
in Excellent Voice.
Subscribers who stayed away from the
opera last night on account of the change
of bill missed more than they imagin-d,
for '"II Trovatore," hackneyed as it is,
was. so much better performed than
"L'Africaine" on the opening night tbat
the old Verdi work was far the more en
joyable of the two. This is easily under
stood, for on VVednesday the performers
had just arrived from a long and trying
journey and were hampered by un
familiar surroundings, and last night all
were fresh and felt at home on the stage.
Mmo. Foeder, the prima donna of
"L'Africaine," appeared last night as
"Leonora" and entirely conquered the
sympathies of the audience in her first
scene. She looked as pretty and gracieuse
with a white skin and her own hair as >he
had looked forbidding in her dusKy
make-up as Sehka. Her voice too showed
the beneficial influence of two days' rest,
and she was applauded aeain and again
for her singing, which was especially
Bweet anu limpid in the upper notes.
The new-comers in the cast were H.
Frevost and Id me. Fremeaux-Benati,
both of whom are sure to add consider
ably to the popularity of the company.
Provost, who played Manrico, has not
such a pleasing all-round voice as Mas
sart, but he takes his high C in the chest
register, a la Tamagno, in a way tbat
makes the audience rise to him. In tbe
first two acts there was no enthusiasm
displayed over him, but his opportunity
came with the "0 toi, mon seul tresor," in
the third act, and the tours de force
which he displayed with his high notes in
that aria established his reputation as a
favorite.
The curtain drops on the tenor's aria,
"Sauvez ma mere," and Prevost's high C
made such an impression that nothing
would satisfy the audience but having the
curtain up and hearing it over aÂ«ain.
Mme. Fremeaux-Benati is the first con*
tralto the company has put forward, Anna
in "l'Africaine"' being nothing but a com
primario. In the rola of Azucena Mme.
Fremeaux-Benati had a fine opportunity
of showing her rich velvety voice, which
is dramatic in quality, and is at the same
time entirely devoid of tbe harshness
which so often mars contraltos. Her sing
ing all through the opera aroused frequent
and hearty applause.
Anoiher good point about Prevost and
Fremeaux-Benati, in addition to their
voices, is lhat they enunciate so clearly
that it is no effort to understand every
word they say, and the contralto excels ill
recitative.
Henry Albers, the barytone, fully re
peated bis success of Thursday night.
His Count di Lnna was an artistic treat
throughout, and his Binging 01 "La peine
d'etre" was something to be remembered.
The minor parts were well sustained
and the male choruses were especially
good. Th â¢ ballet in the chird act was ex
cellent and Mile. I)' Consoii made a great
hit.
This afternoon "Faust" will begin at 1
p m. "Miss Helyett" will be the evening
bill.

The second of the series of Lenten exercises

. Mrs. Louisa Mace Brings Suit for the
Support of Her Feeble-Minded
Sister.
John Feix, hale and hearty, although
75 years of ase, contemplates another
matrimonial venture, to the chagrin of bis
two daughters, Mrs. Louisa Mace and her
sister, Annie Feix.
The latter is 26 years old and is still in
the age of unreason, her sister, Mrs. Mace,
having been appointed her guardian by
the Superior Court on those grounds.
John Feix, the father, nas a penchant
for vis housekeeper, Mary Fogel, who oc
cupies with him a palatial residence at
1116 Pierce street, while the remainder ot
the family reside in a humble cottage at
172 Ferry street, off Point Loboa road.
Mary Fogel, fat, fair and 40, is soon to
become Mi>. Feix,. so the daughters say,
and they are anxious to have their pater
nal parent do what they consider is right
by them before he weds.
In consequence a suit was filed yester
day in the Superior Court by Annie Feix,
through her guardian ad Jitem, .Louisa
Mace, against John Feix, for an order to
cpmpel the latter to give a reasonable
amount monthly for the support of Annie
Feix, and a lump sum as security for her
maintenance. Tbe complainant also begs
t at defendant be compelled to furnish
bonds for a faithful performance of his
duty.
H. B. Davi?, the attorney, has taken up
Annie Fax's case as a "matter of char
ity," he says. He states further that "she
has no mother and is dependent upon the
charity of friends. She is feeble-m inded,
in delicate health and is without the
means to secure tbe necessaries of life.
Her health is so precarious that medical
assistance is in constant need and &he has
not tue means of procuring it"
John Feix, the defendant in the case, is
an employe of the Mint, drawing a roy
alty from the Government for a valuable
patent and receiving a salary of $350 as
head rnelter and refiner. Mrs. Mace de
clares that part of this money should be
paid over to the snpport of the feeble
minded daughter.

THE SPORTING WORLD.
All Aboard for Carson Is the Cryâ Gun, Rifle,
Oar and Bat.
On Wednesday next the sporting pablic
will have an undisputed heavy-weight
champion pueilist of the world. Judging
from the present outlook a. large crowd
will witness the battle, but Dan Stuart's
estimate of 20,000 sports visiting Carson is
far in excess of the number of people who
â¢will invade the sagebrush cit7o:t the 17th.
The wheelmen will have an inning next
week. The great indoor tournament in
the Pavilion is now the sole topic among
cyclists.
Trap-shooting, coursing, rifle-shooting,
baseball and kindred sports are being well
patronized by fanciers.
THE WHEELMEN.
A Splendid Indoor Meat at the Pa
vilion Is Assuredâ To-Morrow's
Races.
Preparations are going steadily along
for the bog three weeks' tournament to be
held in the Mechanics' Pavilion, com
mencing next Saturday night, and ap
pearances indicate that it will be the
greatest cycling event in the history of
the State, and wi!l he on a par with some
of the best ever held in the country.
Certainly for class of competitors there
has never been seen here a more repre
sentative or speedier aggre?atlon. There
are champions of a dozen different climes,
and besides those already on the ground
tlie management expects Michael, the
Welch wonder, Edd*e Bald and Tom
Cooper, the professional champions of
2895-96, Arthur Gardiner, who ranked
next to them, Jay Eaton, the indoor king,
Starbuck, the long-distance champion,
Waller, winner of the Washington six
dav race, and others of lesser note.
To appreciate how much better a meet
this one should be than the one iast year
Jet us make a few comparisons. A supe
rior track is to be erected in the first place.
Two years' experience in track- building
in the Pavilion will be of value in the con
struction of this one, and it will be abso
lutely safe and lightning fast, eight laps
to the mile, well banked. Then the man
agement is better. Last year the meet
was controlled by the ex-chef of the Hotel
del Coronado, one Wikidel, whose unpopu
lhrity grew with the progress of the meet,
until to some of the riders and exhibitors
he was simply unbearable. A against thi
we now have Dave G. Shafer, honest
popular and sunny natured, with a kinc
word for everybody and a record of twen
ty-two years as a sportsman, the latte
half of which has beon devoted to cycling
interests. During his managerial career
he has handled Sander, Cabanne, Titus
Hamilton, Welis, Bob Terrill and a score
of other cracks, nr.d is now in charge
of ail of Morgan & Wright's Pacific Coast
racinz interests, which includes the main
tenance of a team with such stars on it as
Michael, the Welsh champion; Fred
Longhead, the Canadian, who ranks fifth
among American professionals; OttoZleg
ler Jr., Fioyd A. McFarland, C. S. W^lls,
W. A. Terrill and H. F. Terrill of Cali
fornia; 0. L. Stevens of lowa, Max Morris
and George S. Bovee of Texas, and W. E.
Becker ot Minneapolis, the five-mile Na
tional champion. These men will all ap
pear at the Pavilion indoor meet, besides
W alter F. Foster, the champion of Cali
fornia, Allen N. Jones, Hardy Downing,
Frank M. Byrne. Arthur Boyden. the
Dows, Chapman and others in the profes
sional class. To this list must be added
nil the ciever amateurs of the coast â Russ,
Kenna, Mott, Squires. Crafts, Menne, Grif
fiths, Tantau. \\ ing, Dalmas, Kraft, Hall,
Langue tin, . Decker, Barton and â really
tnere are so many of them I had better
stop specifying right now before the list
gets too long for publication.
But the above-named "pros" and ama
teurs comprise a wonderful aggregation
of racing talent, and, as a class, so totally
W. E. BECKER, FIVE-MILE NATIONAL CHAMPION.
eclipse the entry list of last year tnat a
comparison is odious. Last year we used
to go wild over an exciting sprint betwoen
Euch "amateurs" as Wells, Jonnny EJ
wards, Tantaa and Griffiths, ior instance.
They were probably the most consistent
performers of the meet. This year we
will have an opportunity to enthuse over
a finishing sprint between Jimmy Michael,
Fred Loupjbead, Otto Ziegler and Becker
in one heat; Eaton, iJaid, Wells and Sts
vens in another; Cooper. McFarland, Ter
rill and Boyee In the third; Foster, Star
buck, Gardiner nnd Morris in the next,
with enough men left to iill three more
beats with champions. The mind grows
dizzy with t;je contemplation. I am be
ginning to think the indoor meet, com
mencing at the Pavilion next Saturday
night, is going to be the biggest indoor
cycling affair ever held in the United
States without exception.
The entry blanks for the first week's
racine are out and must be sent to S. B.
Vincent, secretary, Baldwin Hotel, not
later than Tuesday, March 16. Two things
the management will enforce: No entries
received after that date will be accepted,
and the entrance fee must in all cases ac
company the biank or the man will not be
Entered.
The Bay City Wheelmen will hold a
five-mile handicap road race to-morrow
over the course from San Mateo to San
Carlos. The handicaps of the men have
not yet been announced, but the following
well-known riders will compete: T. D.
Wells. W. C. Klotz, F. K. Haley. Ben Noo
nan J. C. Williamson, Henry Noonan, M.
M. Gilman, A. J. Menne. G. G. Frisbie.
John Davidson, Walter Davidson, T. Al

J. M. Nye, B. C. Kaynaud, H. W. Welch,
E. T. Mervy, Fred Boeckmann, Thomas 8.
Hall, V. W. StilJ, C. A. Kraft, E. D. Men
deli and J. M. Mendell. The handicaps
will be eiven out to-nisrht. A prize list oi
rare value has been -offered for the best
performances. Captain Henry L. Day
will lead a run down to witness the event,
starting from the club at 8 :30 a. m. From
the results of this race the club's relay
committee will be aided in the selection
of a team.
Somebody with a fondness for figures
shows the large increase in the bicycle
business in the' following paragraph:
Prior to 1885 there were but 6 bicycle
factories in this country. In that year
there were 11,000 machines turned out.
Five years later mere were 17 factories,
with an outputof 40,000 wheeK In 1894
the factories increased rapidly, and
125,000 machines were turned out. Ayear
later ihe production was 600,000 and the
number ot factories 500, none of which
turned out less than 1000 wheeJa a year.
The capital invested in these large fac
tories is $90,000, and the estimate of the
output for the present year is not less
than 1,000,000 wheels, valued at $60,
--000,000.
Captain Argenti has called a club run of
the Camera Ciub Cyclists for to-morrow to
San Leandro. Members are notified to
take tne 9 a. m. creek-route boat to foot of
Broadway, Oakland. The run will be via
San t&blo avenue, Berkeley, Temescal to
San Leandro.
The O.ympic Club Wheelmen will hold
a ten-mile try-out to-morrow over the
Haywards course. Captain Hadrnfeldt
will lead a run to the finish to witness the
event.
The Referee, one of the leading cycling
trade journals of this country, has decided
to commence the issue in the near future
of an English edition. It will ba printed
in London. The purpose of this project is
to give to American manufacturers a full
measure of fair play, something which the
English cycle papers have never yet been
known to do. American wheels are gain
ing in favor on the other side, and the
Referee proposes to help them along to
the best of its ability.
The Imperial Cycling Club will hold its
ten -mile road race to-morrow, the one
postponed from last Sunday owing to
rain. The entries and handicaps are:
I. R. L.nd, W. W. Mack, E. A. Bozio, Milton
M. Cook, scratch; A. A. Onion, E. C. Barley,
K. F. Hamau, 1 minute; E. L. Cordy, W. H.

3 minutes; C. W.Collins, C. Schenck, 3:30;
11. Behrman, T. J. Wiuslow, G. Clabrough, F.
C. Behrman, 4 minutes.
The race will be from Fruitvale to Hay
wards, the start being at High street,
Fruitvale, at 11 a. m. There is a valuable
prize-:iÃt nnng up tor the event. Captain
Troniet will take over a club run on the 9
o'clock boat to witness the race.
Chief Consul Kerrigan of the North Cali
fornia division. League of American
Wheelmen, has called a meeting of the

RING AND GLOVE.
Why Fitzslmmons Should Whip
Corbett on Wednesday
at Carson.
The following communication from ah
athlete who has witnessed many hard*
fought battles under Queensberry and
prize-ring rules has been received. It
speaks for itself:
San Francisco, March 12, 1897.
Sporting Editor < a'iâ LÂ»eab Sir: Who is go
ing to prove victor in ihe above battle is the
question agitating fistic sportsmen for the
uonce. The majority favor Corbett, of course,
bat the minority, composed In this instance,
perhaps, of thoie who keep in closer touch
with real pugilistic capabilities are (wisely)
pinning their taith to Fitzsimmons.
The man who selects a winner or who hots
upon any particular individual through mere
sentiment or fellowship is childish and one
who looks upon his money simply as a mere
adjunct for the more forcibly expressing his
faith in his "favorite"; and there are thous
ands of such in the affair in question who are
very liable to suffer grievous disappointment
in consequence.
Ihis man Fitzsimmons, so frequently re
ferred to heretofore by Mr. Corbett as being "a
cur." "coward." etc., is very liable indeed to
lower the "champion's" colors on March 17,
and why shouldn't he? What has Corbett
done during his fisticcareer that Fiizslmmons
could not have done equally as well, and per
haps a trifle botier? Curbeti's defeat of Sulli
van brought to him so much unquestioned
fame that most of the former's admirers never
stopped to consider that in disposing of the
famous John L. he had only whipped a waning
glory. His "no contest" with JaCKson was not
particularly creditable to either man, and in
stead of being alluded to by Corbett as an in
stance of how long he could "stand up" before
.so rcduUDiable aiid dusky an opponent, could
rather be more honestly referred to as an in
stance of how long he could "keep away."
Kitzsimmons has not been found to be this
kind of a "fighter," as Corbf tt will probably
find out upon their personal interview.
Now. with regard to Filzsimmons being a
"cur" and "coward," he has, I think, given
the He to this to his would-be detractors time
aud again. Again, is it not a mutter of pugi
listic history, tnat to avoid an issue with Fitz-
Himiuo:is, Corbctt hit upon the "happy"
(though unfortunate) idea of finding a worthy
"substitute" to go up against the daring Aus
tralian, who had the temerity to challenge
him, the Â«roat Corbett, to fistic combat, and
selected the redoubtable Maher to trouuee the
presumptious Filzsimmons; and the better to
gird ttie Irish champion's !oin<i, presented
him with the "championship"? What did
Fits do witb the Corbett representative; Did
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 13, 1897.
he wrangle for months about the "profes
sional etiquette" of meeting this or that man
who had been thrown in the breach between
himself and another? Not jnuchl He ac
cepted Mr.Corbett's little amendment, coupled
with Maher's deli; buckled on his armor, went
forth and laiu tne valiant Maher low in some
thing less than two minutes' actual warfare.
This was surely a hard enough blow to the
Irish champion, but must have been a demor
alized, indeed, to the super-sensitive Cor
bett, to have the "cowardly" Australian step
in where he had feared to tread, and dispose
of his duly accredited substitute literally in a
punch.
Both principals in the coming contest are
doing lots of "talking." but as both are pre
sumably well paid for It we can hardly blame
them. But, so far as Fitzsimmons is con
cerned, one must admit that he has hereto
fore fulfilled all bis boasts with striking ac
curacy; ana there is no very valid reason in
sight why he should not be able to make
good his claims of ability to defeat corbett.
All Cnrbett's admirers point to his remark
able cleverness in avoiding punishment by the
knack of "keeping away" from his antagonist.
A child's knowledge of affairs pugilistic ought
to convince anybody that the man to lick
Fitzsimmons is not the one whose chief clev
erness lies in his ability of "keeping away."
To punish Fitz Corbett will have to come
within range, and 'twill be then, probably,
that Fitz will find his opportunity.
Corbett'* condition must be superb, accord
ing to all accounts. This Is as it should be;
although just prior to the Corbett-Sharkey
contest we were told much the same thing.
Still, Corbett and his advisers should know
enoneh to realize that unless their principal
is a 200 or 300 per cent better man tnan when
Sharkey fought him to a standstill he has no
business in the rin? with Fiiz-immons.
There are three things Fitzaimmons is going
to bring forcibly home to Corbeu's notice on
the memorable 17th. The first will be the lie
direct to the oft-repeated Corbett-Brady taunt
ing boast tnat Fitz ;\vill never show up in thÂ«*
ring. The second will be the utter mortifica
tion to Corbett at seeing Filzsimmons enter
the ring ihe favorite in the betting. The
third will beâ well, Corbett will the better
realize what this wiil be alter it is all over.
Of course, there are the usual rumors afloat
concerning the integrity 01 the principals to
this great fight; but it is difficult to corceive
who or what is to compensate either man for
"throwing" it, with so much-^everything, in
fact, In the way of reward and renown â await
ing the winner. Therefore, upon the honest
assumption that both are "out to win," I look
for Fuzsimmons to be returned the winner
inside of tea rounds. J. G. B.

The Dolphins and South Ends In
Training for the Next
Regatta.
Last Sunday the Dolphin Club crew
composed of W. O. Patch stroke, Dick
Blennerhassett forewaist, Alex Sape after
waist, J. J. Cronin bow and L. Duncan
coxswainâ had a rough trip in their row
from their clubhouse at the fool of Van
Ness avenue boulevard to the South Ends'
house at the end of Third street.
Off Folsom street tney encountered the
southeast winds that filled their boat, and
when they arrived at the South Ends'
they bad to take the boat in the house to
unship ihe water.
The club members have offered a valu
able medal to be competed ior by the out
rigger-skiff men. The race will come off
May 9, and J. R. Keenan, A. W. Pape,
J. Ai. Ferguson, W. A. Patch and R. J.
Blennerhassett are the present entries.
Tnree more are expected before the race.
J. M. Ferguson is a new member, but
has had lots of experience in shells, hav
ing won is first races at Toronto.
The club initiated one member last
night and two were elected. With the
three applications for membership the
club's membership roll is full.
The following are the new members:
Al Shields, Harper Williamson, A. 11.
Pape, W. L. Meyer.
The club is to' give an excursion on May
2 to Bohemian Grove for the purpose ot
raisine funds to purchase a new race
barge and to build a handball court.
. The Dolphin end South End baseball
game is to be played March 31 at the Pre
sidio erounds, the proceeds to go to the
unemployed lund.
Judge Thomas H. Keogh of tbe
Dolphins left lor Washington Monday
night. He expects to see the Harvard
crew train before he returns and will then
be able to explain the stroke taucht by
Coach Luhman of the Leauder crew of
England.
On last Tuesday evening six more
â¢names were added to tbe long list of mem
bership of the South End Rowing Club
und four applications were presented to
be acted upon at the next meeting. Tbe
names of the new members are: James
Feehan of the Hastings .Law College,
Archie J. Campbell, William Mulherne,
William Fox. Edward O'Brien and Frank
Mayo of the Olympic Club.
At the same meeting the club decided
to bring an action against the Acme Club
of Oakland for damages sustained through
the los< of the barge Garrield, which tne
South Ends had loaned to the Acme Club
and which was afterward destroyed by
fire in the latter club's boathouse. Al
though the crew rowed under the Acme
Club's colors and borrowed the boat in
the club's name they refuse to make sat
isfaction.
Dr. Dennis was out in his skiff last Sun
day morning, and gave the intermediate
crew a lively race from the sugar wharf to
the boathouae. The doctor is down al
most every Sunday, aad has greatly im
proved in his style of rowing since his race
with William McCauslancl.
Fran* Duplissea is getting ready for the
senior skiff race in the carnival regatta,
and will settle down to hard training in a
few weeks.
Tne new senior crew took their usual

Thomas says they are in fine condition
and ready to race the Midgets at a mo
ment's noiice.
A crew composed of Frank Burke,
Maurice Pope, James Feehan and Archie
Campbell rowed around Goat Island on
Sunday afternoon. This crew will repre
sent the club in the maiden race, which is
to be one of the features of the carnival
regatta.
Will Patch, Alex Pape. Lith Duncan
and Jack Cronin of the Dolphins visited
the South Ends Jast Sunday morning.
THE RIFLE.
Phllo Jacoby's Misfortune â The
Schuetzen Club's Festival. -
The California Schnetzen Club, which is
one of the oldest and strongest rifle-shoot
ing societies in America, is making very
extensive preparations for its annual pic
nic and prize-shooting festival at Schuet
zen Park, Ban Rafael, on April 4.
Forty cash prizes are offered for ring
target-shooting, running from $1 to |40
and over $1000 in cash and jewelry will be
given for the honorary- target contests.
Several other handcome prizes amonnting
to several hundred dollars will be awarded
to the successful competitors in other
forms of shooting.
The style of shooting will be offhand.
Judging from the large numbers of people
who have signified their willingness to
compete in the sports of the day, Schuet
zen Park will have an enormous crowd on
the afternoon of April 4.
The regular monthly medal shooting of
the Germania Scbuetzen Club will take
place to-morrow at Shell Mound Park.
The Nord Deutscher Schuetzen Club
will hold to-morrow at Bhell Mound Park
its regular monthly bullseye shooting
matcnes.
The many friends of Philo Jacoby will
regret to learn that the iamous old war
rior and celebrated rifle shot is at present
confined to his room at 118 Grent avenue
with a wounded knee, which was caused
by a fall. It is hoped that Philo will
quickly recover from his injury and once
aeain be seen at the ranges, as there is no
sound as musical to his ear as the "bark"
of a Schuetzen Club rifle.
THE GUN.
Where the Sportsman Will Meet
To-morrow to Smash Clay Birds.
Now that the quail and ducks are pro
tected by law, gun clubs are being organ
ized in all parts of the country lor the pur
pose of engaging in trap-shooting con
tests. Each Sunday from now until the
opening of the game season matches will
be held at the Olympic grounds ami IngleÂ«
side and at the tournament grounds on
the east side of the bty.
Tne Empire Gun Club will meet to-mor
row at Alameda Point, and at 10 o'clock
class shooting will commence. The first
event will be a 25-bird race, and the prize
will bi $100, divided into ;our parts. Tne
second will be a coast record match, fifty
birds. Entrance $1 25.
The prize is a beautiful diamond medal,
which will be known as the coast record
medal for 1897. It will become the prop
erty of the shooter winning the greatest
number of times in the six shoots of the
season. The third event will be a 25
--bird race for medals, and the fourth and
Jast event of the day will be a 30-bird race.
Entrance $L The prize, $125 in gold coin,
will be divided into five parts. The new
"Maganirap" will be used on this occa
sion.
The second inanimate target tourna
ment of the Golden Gate Gun Club will
be held to-morrow at the Pacific Tourna
ment Association grounds, Alameda
J unction, commencing at 10 a. m.
Eight events figure on the programme,
one of which is a 10-bird shoot for ladies
only. Class shooting will prevail and all
ties will be divided.
The Reliance Gun Club will also hold a
shoot to-morrow in Alameda.
ANGLING.
Deputy Fish Commissioners Will
Patrol Coast Streams of
the State.
Doubtless there will be a rush of anglers
to-day to Point Reyes and Sheilville,
which are the two nearest points witbin
close proximity to the fis bin k grounds.
The water is in splendid condition, and a
sportsman who returned yesterday from
the point stated that several large fish
were caught since Sunday, most of which
were steelheads that were returning to the
sea.
The indications for good fishing above
tidewater on April 1 are now very good,
and if the weather remains fine until the
latter part of this month anglers can
count upon filling their baskets with nice
trout. It is hoped that the Fish Commis
sioners will nee into the advisability of
having a deputy patrol the coast streams
from now until the opening day of the
trout season, as considerable poaching
will be done just as soon as the water
clears.
The Fly-casting Club was disappointed
for the third time last Tuesday evening.
Professor Gilbert of Stanford University
was journeying to this City from Palo
Alto tor the purpose of lecturing before
the club on the fres h- water rjshes of the
coast, when the train in which he was
riding was delayed several hours by some
accident. The professor returned to the
college and telegraphed the club that un
less "something very unforeseen" occurs
he will positively address the lovers of
the gentle sport of fly-casting at their
next meeting. Doubtless the professor
will be well prepared to handle the sub
ject in a manner that will delight his
hearers.
BASKET-BALL.
A Splendid - Game Played In < the
1 . Y. M. C. A. Gymnasium
of Oakland. ... .
â < A fine exhibition of the game of basket
ball was given last i Thursday j evening at
; the Oakland Y. M. C. A: \ gymnasium,
when the ; Business â¢ Men's team sof * the
San'; Francisco Men's â  ' Christian
Association played the Athens of Oakland.
It was one of ' the important . games of ? a
championship series between the Oakland
and . San Fran Cisco > basket-ball teams. 1
Both teams played well. >.y :â¢.'
In the first naif the team from Oakland
was a- little ahead. Captain West bad
thrown two 1 goals {on i fouls, making two
points for his s.'de. He landed the ball

Unemployed Filed Applica

Work.

Mostly Middle- Aged Old Residents

lief Ccmmitteo.
The registration office for unemployed
men seeking work on the proposed boule
vard was opened yesterday forenoon at
11:30 o'clock, and when it closed at 4
o'clock 840 applications had been received.
At 9 o'clock about 150 in a body marched
over from the headquarters of the organ
ized unemployed to the registration office
and found fifty men in . line ahead of
them. Some deprecatory remarks were
exchanged, and then the marching force,
with an American t\a ' at ita head and the
banner "We Demand Recognition" held
aloft quit the scene, only to return later
and fall in the long single line kept in
place by several policemen.
An examination of 100- applications as
they were on file showed the following
facts: Fifty-nine men were laborers and
forty-one were men with some trade or
particular occupation. There were forty
one married men, six widower and fifty
three single men. Just fifty of them, or
half the number, had other persona de
pendent upon them, an average of three
each. The average ape of ttie 100 men was
forty-three years and their average resi
dence in this City sixteen years. Only
fifteen bad resided here less than five
years. The oldest of these 100 men was
76 years of age and the youncest 23.
Mrs. Flint, secretary of the Associated
Charities, took 200 of the applications to
examine. Inside of an hour, aided by the
records of her office, she was able to send
back to the relief committee with favora
ble recommendations some sixty applica
tions from men with persons dependent
upon them for support, for these receive
the first cbance at the work.
A careful record will be kept out on the
boulevard of the working ability and the
willingness of the m-n to work, so that
impostors may be recorded for future pre
cautions.
It is likely that 100 men may be pot to
work on Monday or on Tuesday, and
others will lollow as there are chances.

At the beariqua ters of the unemployed
there was another mass-meeting last
night. The proposition of incorporation
was discouragedon the eround that it was
a plan of a few to get the funds, stop is
suing food and eventually share the
money after the majority should leave in
disgust. During the general discussion
the relief committee was voted out of of
fice without a hint of thanks for its ser
vices and with suggestions of favoritism in
fssuing selected old clothes. In its place
a committee of five was ejected to buy to
day $50 worth of provisions.
It is estimated that only about a third
of those who resistered for work were
from the organized unemployed, many of
whom are opposed to the possibility of
getting only a dollar a day.

CAPTURED PURSES
The Other Events at Em
eryville Went to
Favorites.
Bourbon, a Heavily Piayed Long
Shot, Took the Opening
Racs.
Judge Denny Bsat Morte Fonse a
Headâ Cash Day Showd
Rare Form
JTonr first choices and three lon r priced
outsiders eloped with the purses hung up
at Emeryville yesterday. The track was
in good condition and fast time marked
the running of most of the events.
Eleven cheap rlaters lined up in tbe
opening live-furlong scramb'e, with Wood
land Belle ruling an 11 to 5 favorite. The
race looked very much like a "shoo-in"
for the outsider Bourbon. Backed from
30 down to 12 and 15 to 1, the long shot
wns allowed to make his own pace and led
the favorite out a length in I:o2}^. Adam
Andrew came up at the end, taking the
show.
The fourteen starters in the six-furlong
1 s ffair were also of the "skate" species anil
â 'all were- accorded scattering support. It
proved a gift for the 16 to 5 choice Dolore,
which led throughout nnd won with ease
from Cnvallo, well played at 8 to 1 with
Thorpe up.
In the thrpe and a half furlong scram
ble, Rev El Santo, the Baldwin entry, a
son of Emperor of Norfolk and Jennie D,
showed himself to be a corking good
yonnpster. He opened in the betting at
7 and was played down to 5. The splen
did-looking colt took hold of Little T G,
the second choice, a: the head of the
s:retch, and standing a grueliinc drive I
e.^rned the verdict by a neck in 4"-% sec, a
new coast record for the distance. The
former mar 1 ; was 43 1 4 sec. Thorpe, the
favorite, was third.
The mile and a furlong selling event
proved a very pxeiting affair. Judge
Denny, with 100 pounas up and Pigso;t in
the saddle, was a 3 to 2 favorite, and he
and Morte Fonse, rilJen by McHugh,
fought it out all the way. PiÃsott out
rode McHn<;h the last, furlong, and landed
tba-'black hor.-e winner a short head in
1:55. Adolph Spreckels was a good third.
The old cripple, Cash Day. was in fine
fettle, and backed from 3 to 2 down to |
evens he walked away witn tbe fifth race, j
over seven furioncs, stepping the distcnce
off in 1:27.. Sallie Ciicquot led to the
stretch, where the favorite ueaded her
and won easing up. The start was a mis
erable one, lnstailator, with Thorpe up,
being virtually left at the post.
The speedy Summertime opened an
even-money choice for the mile selling
run that was next down for decision, but
for some reason appeared to be a drug on
the market, receding to 8 to 5. The big
money went in on Lincoln 11, cutting his
odds from twos to 6 to 5.
Yankee Doodle and Nebuia made the
running to the stretch, where Lincoln got
through on the inside and, hard ridden,
finished over two lengths ahead of Yankee
Doodle. Benameia, away from the post <

M. Clicquot at odds of 20 to 1 captured

from the start. Tulare, another outsider,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 13, 1897.
SHOT BY HIS
MOTHER-IN-LAW
Lawyer Julian Pinto Badly
Wounded by an
Angry Woman.
The Affair the Direct Result of
a Series oi Domestic
Quarrels.
It Is Charged That tbe Womai Is
Demented â Pinto's Wife in a
Critical Condition.
By the bedside of bis wife and new- Dor n
babe Julian Pinto, the Police Court nttor
ney, sank down yesterday, while bis blood
flowed over the sheets, the door and even
ihe dress of the agent of the crime.
A mother-in-law, a domestic quarrel and
a revolver â that was the combination
JULIAN PINTO, the Police Court La wyer, Who Lies Helpless a
the Receiving Hospital as the Result of a Shot From His
Mother-in -Law.
which landed him in the Receiving Hos
pital.
The shooting occurred at 1528 Market
street yesterday about 1 p. m , and tvas
done by Mrs. Latham, the mother of Pin
to's wife, who herself lies ill in bed by the
side of her child, born day before yester
day. It was caused by a domestic quarrel.
Several days asro Mrs. Latham was sum
moned from her home on East Twelfth
street, East Oakland, to attend her 'laugh
ter during her illness. Pinto and his
mother-in-law have not bf-en on good
terms and quarreled twice yesterday
morning, and Frank Littie, a collector
and her son by a former husband, was
obliged to interfere on botn occasions.
He is a partner with Pinto and h.-.s offices
in the same building.
On the occasion in question the woman
followed Pinto inio the bedroom, where
his wife lay, and renewed the quarrel,
whereupon her called he a hard name.
Pulling a revolver, she pulled the trigger
beloie he could flee.
Tne bullet struck Pinto in the lower
lip, passed under his tongue and broke
several teeth, severed three or four arteries
and lodged in the right side of the jaw.
Tbe wounded man was at once con
veyed to the Receiving Hospital.
A profuse hemorrhage resulted from
the wound, which was pronounced very
serious hy Assistant Police Surgeon Bun
p.eli. Late m the aft moon the blood
ceased to flow, but Pinto was unable to
speak. It is probable now that he will
recover.
After the shooting Mrs. Latham left the
house by tlie Mnrket-street entrance, and
though Detectives Egan and Silvey
searched industriously, they were unable
to find her yesterday. She is about 60
years of age and regarded as simple
minded by her relatives. Another daugh
ter, Mrs. Standish, resides at 13i4 Valen
cia street.
Details of the shooting are hard to ob
tain, as Mrs. Pinto is in a precarious con
dition, and what little she was able to say
was interrupted â , by her > brother, Frank.
Little.' She stated, however, that she saw
the shooting. and that v her mother is de
mented and has been for a long time.-; *.
FranK Little, Pinto' a brother-in-law, was
a witness 10 the shooting, bat declines to
speak.
"If Julian dies 1 will give the details of
the whole affair," he asserted, "but other
wise I intend to keep silent." "
' Little spent a great part of the afternoon
administering to Pinto's wants at the hos
pital. . When the t wounded .." man wished
anything he was obliged to make his de
sire known in writin j.X" â 'â¢â¢â¢*â  â

the woman who did the shooting, is said
to have died in ' this City about a month
ago. He and his wife lived together only
about a week. Â; ;:;â
Pinto has been in trouble before this,
and iin February, 1883, was sentenced to
rive years in San Quentin \ for shooting a
gambler named Patrick Burns. His sen
tence was : commuted" to three years by
Governor Stoneman, and that tune was
served by him. Though be has cured in
other cases in an unenviable position, not
much has been heard of him here lately.
Since biÃ release from the penitentiary he
has been a familiar figure round the police

HALE & NOECROSS.
Answer Filed Denying M. W. Fox's
Allegation* ot Fraud.
The Hale & Norcross Mining Company
ought to begin to pay dividends soon if
tlie mine at Virginia City is as prolific of
bullion as the ban Francisco office is ot
litigation.
The defendants in the auit brought by
M. W. Fox to restrain G. W. Grayson and
others from voting stock and proxies at
the annual meeting of the company filed
an snswer in Judge Slat k's court yester
day. The answer denies the charges of
conspiracy and sets f> rth facts about the
meetinz, alleging that 86,716 shares out of
112,000 shares of capital stock were repre
sented by the defendants; further, that
the defendants were served with a copy of
the injunction, but were not served with
a copy of the complaint and the sum
mons. Therefore ihey ask that the in
junction be dissolved, and that as another
meeting is to be held on March 17 a hear
ing be granted as speedily as possible, and
that M. W. Fox and oheis be restrained
from interfering with the progress of the
annual election.
Judge Slack has agreed to hear argu
ment in the case to-day.

study, assisted by all that was best in the
progress of medical science at home and
abroid, fir-t discovered t c wonderful for-
mula of Paine's celery compound.
There was no doubt of tue interest that
would be awakened at once by the an-
nouncement of any discsvery by Professor
Phelps. The formula from the first was
furnished to the best physicians, and
forthwith this remarkable Paine's celery
compound was personally used and pro-
fessionally prescribed by them. The re-
sv.lt of the closest investigation mi.-ut
have been expected. It soon required a
considerable industry to produce the
remedy, and rapidly but steadily, without
ceasing, the demand for Paine's celery
compound has increased, until to-day
there is no other remedy that in compari-
son begins to hold half the public atten-
tion that it holds.
In untoM number of cases where every
otber remedy has been tried and failed,
Pnine's celery compound has attained the
wisued-for results, making the weak
strong, purifying the blood, rebuilding
the worn-out nervous tissue, curing
chronic sickness, proving a never-failing
and permanent relief for rheumatism,
neuralgia, kidney diseases and disorders
of the liver, all due to the impairment of
t c person's nervous system, the conse-
quent impoverishment of the blood and
me brraking down in consequence of some
particular orean.

When Mr. Gra' am, writing; January 18,
1897, said: "I have used Paine's â¢ celery
compound to my bencti:, and I nave no
doubt that any person undergoing great
physical and menial strain would find it
of great service. For students especially
it ought to be of ereat value" â when so
prominent a studeut of bodily health,
who has no equal, unless, perhaps, one
mentions Dr. Sargent of Harvard, with
whose methods Mr. Graham became well
acquainted at Harvard â when Mr.
Grahum says bluntly that after his ex-
perienca ne believes others would find
Paine's celery compound of great service,
what man or woman out of perfect health
cm afford to neglect his well-considered
and expert advice?
T ere is no doubt that Paino's celery
compound cleans the blood of eczema,
salt rheum and such humors, not only in
t c spring, that is so favorable a time, but
at any time during the year, so thor-
oughly that nothing further is ever beard
of them.
Paine : s celery compound has been
tested, tried, scrutinized and heartily ap-
proved by so many impartial physicians
and men and women whose word in any
matter would not be questioned for a mo-
ment, that one must oe stubborn-minded
indeed who prefers to mope around half
siok instead of verifying thesa positive,
straightforward statements.

THK WOOL TRADE,
Jacob Wollner's circular says:
â â¢Our market la still very quiet, although some
wools have been si-i.mg when a buyer could be
found at about the same prices which ruled the
Ist of Kebruarv. '1 here Is still considerable old
wool lv the market, both scoured and In the grease.
Kanterti purchasing agents still cannot get orders
of any consequence, and when they have any in
quiry Uieir customers will not come up to the
prices atlted in this market, which a.c about par
with the Boiion market
â¢ So far only about 150 bales of new spring wool
liavf- come into tin- market, but k Is not verr at
tractive, us it Is luil 01 bun nnd is rather dark In
color. 1 ihlnk ilnre will not b- much wool In be
fore the Is of next month.
â¢ Tne Kastern markft is reported steady with
smalls leH, more of foreign than domestic wools,
with prices well sustained but no' any biguer.
â¢Ihe i.oiiiliim s li-s opened la 1 Tuesda:* with
good wools, such as are linported to this country,
at tbe name prices as at the previous s*l>, with
in, illy and defective wools 6 per cent lower. It Is
presumed tna tho bulk of the beat wools offered
now in Loti'lon will be bought for this country.
'â¢The Ways and Means Committee of Congress
has not >â¢â¢ 1 decided on tbe schedule of tariff on
wool and woolens. There Is no doubt but that we
will have onÂ«. The only quustlou is, how much T
1 ihlnk It will do little good for this dip, or even
for this year, ax ho much loreign wool IslmDortrd
as Is unprecedented in history. And with the sur
plus xiock of domestic wool held over from pre
vious raÂ«n 1 1 loOka as if wools wiligo much higher
for one year at least."

CHICAGO, IliÂ». March 12 â Yesterday's stam
pede of longs in wheat was followed this morning
by a steadier tone. The liquidation which took
place yps.< rday was heavy; but the trade was dis
posed to look for a further loosening up of hold
ings, and *Â». only deterred from making another
drive at prices by the presence of a cold wave over
the winter wheat belt. Liverpool cables were

Receipts were light, Chicago having bat 19 cars,
and the Northwest 172. The latter. section had

there is gradual increase in the demand for plates,

the advent of spring weatner and outdoor work
much morÂ« business is expected. The starting of

encouraging. The transfer of the I.ebish val'ey

of anthracite coal loons toward n bigger demand
and better employment in the luture. The reports

Washington eight shipments or 13,620 tons, one
cargo from Australia 1881 tons; t0ta1, : 29,201 tons.
We are clearly demonstrating how independent of
England and A ustralla Iwe have become for our
fuel I necessities, " as our S coast . collieries : are not
being culled upon to furnish their posslb.e output,
vet ne are amply supplied for all our immediate
demands. It is well to feel i that we are so circum
stanced, In case of any forelÂ«ti com l ions. as
lack of fuel would prove 'a mosi serious misfor
tune. .Of course foreign Coals will always figure
largely among our foreign imports, as tonnage
must -seek . this port annually to transport our
grain, and Coal will always' occupy about 71% of
the space Ot i incoming vt- saels' capacity. . It as in
anticipated, we snail have; permitting)
fuliy 1.000.000 tons of whÂ»nl and barley for ship
ment after the incoming crops are harvested, then
large Imports Of foreign iuel become in-- vi able.

WANT A RECOUNT
The Result of the Election
Is Highly Satisfactory
to the Mayor.
Explains How Some Railroad
Men Were Interested in
His Campaign.
Some Secrets of the Mayor's Office
Maie Pubic b; Hs
Honor. 0
. Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 12. j
Many statements having been published
to the effect that Mayor Davie intended to
contest the election of Captain Tnomas,
he publicly contradicted them to-night.
He said :
All Intimations that I intend to contest the
election nre fnite and have not emanated from
me. 1 believe the election officers were hon
est and that a recount would be just as likely
to rob me ofa lew votes as to add '.hem to my
share. Since the result was known many
veop.e have been to my office, telliuit me thai
in certain precinct? ihe election officers were
not properly chosen or were not .â -worn in and
that there were other such petty irregulari
ties; but 1 am sttiisned that they are unworthy
of notice und were but unintentional errors
even if they existed. I shall certainly not
show such pusillanimity as to attempt to take
advantage of any alleged technical irreg
ularity.
I am satisfied with the result as regards all
the candidate?, because I believe they honestly
represent the choiceof the majority of voters.
I have been before ti.e people for two years,
and feel highly uratified that in spite of all
the influences that were brought to bear
against me, and all the secret auempii to un
dermine me, that I came out within 100 votes
*>i befnsc a winner. There were 9000 votes
cast, and a man should feel that hisconduci
has been ihoroughy approved when he loses
re-election by sucn a small margin.
During the last campaign 1 did not make a
f:- gJe speech, prcierring to let the people
judge tey the work of the last two years, and I
am vjfery gratified at their judgment. Otner
candidates have found it necessary to repeat
nightly whut they would do and what they
vrculd not do, but my voice has not been heard
once, neither has any newspaper made my
fi.ght. Under thesa conditions my position is
very gratifying to me.
I have not by word or deed done anything
or said anything to injure the chances of any
candidate. I have shown t:.e kindliest feeling
toward them all and have not referred in any
manner to anything that might hurt any of
ray opponents.' chances of election. Others
cannot say the same regarding me, but I bear
them no ill wi. !. The matter was decided by
the public and I abide by their decision.
It has been published that the railroad peo
jle were making my fight. To a certain ex
tent.they were. Tneir doing so was the logical
result of my known standin? on certain issues
before the people. Ido not approve of forcing
any community to attend c.n:rcti or to fre
quent saloons or to go to San Francisco to
fepend their money. I nave irequently stated
t..is and ks a result al; the German element of
local society, naturally the liquor-dealers, and
most of tne liberal-minded people decided to
support me. With that strength there is a
certain following of politicians who are sup
posed to b* friendly with the railroad. They
added their strength to the others and natur
ally were found among my supporters.
I did not Â»eek their support, an<i of course I
did not scorn it. No man with anr knowledge
of politics would. I can now, however, hon
estly say thai I have never consulted a single
railroad official si cc I took r.ffiee, regarding
support, nei'her have I been visited by any of
theirfriends, and neither have I pledged my.
S'.-lf in any manner to aid them ia anything
tiiey might desire.
One reason for the friendliness of all the
railroads is that I have treated them cour
teously.' When it has been repored to me
that their Servants had been violating some
of the city ordinances i have at once dicta'ed
to them a letter instructing them as to their
duty, and calling their delinquencies to their
attention.
And I have never had to do this twice in
PROFESSOR L. D. SYLE
BERKELEY, Cal., March 12.â Professor Louis Dv Pont Syle of the department
of EngliA at the State University has turned playwright and has produced a four-act
drama from Sir Walter Besant's "Chaplain of the Fleet," which a company of uni
versity actors are preparing to present on Charier <iay, March 22. This U not
Proiessor Syle's first attempt at play writing, as he produced last year an adaptation
of Congreve's "Love for Love," which was presented three times by Btudents with
much success. .
The play upon which the young college thespians are now and have been vigor
ously working for the last three months promises to be even more sucessful than
that of a year ago. Seventeen are in the cast of the "Chaplain's Revenue," live of
vhom played in "Love for Love." Besides beinp the composer of the drama Professor
Syle i 3 his own director and stace manager, and will superintend the performance
before the footlights irom beginning to end.
Those who are in the cast are as follows: Frank Dunn. Harry H. Hirst, H. C.
d Marmon, Charles A. BUtOB, G. D. Kierulff, Elliott Pierce, F. G. Bioletti, Stuart Geis,
Aw W Mem G L. Cross, F. C. Pache, Miss Aurelia Henry, Miss Alice Mawhebout,
IM< E B Svle Miss A L Nye and Miss Anna Brown. Of these Miss Alice Marche
bout and mTss Syle, au.d Messrs. iJunn, Bioletti and Kierulff, played in "Love lor
Love" The play is at tracing considerable attention in college circles, and many
letter's of inquiry concerning the production have b.-en received. The University of
Caiirornia and Harvani hav.- tiken the initiative in developin X the Mstrionic talent
in students. The college play has now come to be an annual feature at Berkeley,
Though the juniors and the Skull and Keys Society annually present a play, their
productions are usual:y of a farcica! nature, while the "university play" is generally
considered to Le deeper, and the result of more experience on the part of the com.
'.poser and more learning ou the part of the performer*.

OAKLAND, Cal., March 12. â Mrs.
Douglas of FruitVrtle ls ree * T nis morn
ing George Douglas was granted a divorce
on the ground of cruelty.
The husband told tne court of the
manner in which he was neglected and of
his wife's many unkind acts, and also
described how thoroughly their tastes
were at variance. Mrs. Douglas did not
put in an appearance, either in person or
by counsel, and Judge Hall awarded the
decree.
Mrs. Douglas recently left Oakland for
Los Angeles, where sbo will in future re
side. It will be recalled that she came
into public notice a couple of months ago
by being arrested at San Jose at the in
aance of her husband, and charged with
stealing her wedd ng-ring. This incident
led to an expose of ihe romantic career of
Mrs. Douglas, who acknowledged that
horse-riding, hunting and outdoor sports
were far more congenial to her than do
mestic life.
The little boy will, remain with his
father. Before her marriage, eight years
ago, Mrs. Douglas was Miss Jeuuie Van

While Goiog to the Morgue

Upright.
It Was Not Death, but an Objid
L sson for the Advocates of
Temperance.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 12. j
A dead man was found at Miller's lode
ing-house on lower Washington street
last nip tit. He had engaged a room at the
house and given bis name as Hutcuinson
and nothing was known of him except
that he was a hard drinker.
The matter was reported to the officer
on the beat and a message was sent to the
Coroner's office. Deputy Quellin went to
the lodging-house with the Morgue wagon,
where several people were standing
around the dead man, who was found on
the rear step. *
Quellin told the landlord what ho had
come lor, and was at once shown the
corpse. The casket which is carried for
use on such occasions was taken through
tbe lodging-house, and two or three men
helped the deputy to place the dead man
in it.
As they were returning to the wagon
the corpse rubbed his eyes and expressed
surprise at his surroundings. A little
closer investigation showed that Mr.
Hutchinson had merely been indulging in
his favorite habit. Landlord Miller was
so taken aback to see his dead guest bit
up in the coffin that he nearly fainted.
After placing Hutchinson in :. is room to
sleep off the deoauch the wagon drove
back, and the Coroner will get no fee for
some time out of HutchlnÂ«on.

ALAMEDA, Cal., March 12.â The peo
ple of Alameda were pleased to-day to
hear that ; of its own volition the Oakland
Gas, Light and Heat f Company had re
duced the rate which it '< charges for. gas
from $2, - the; present rate,- to ' $175 : per
1000 feet r for illuminating purposes, and
from $1 75 to $1 60 for fuel. This *â  makes
the cost to ; the: consumer the same as in
San Francisco, although ; it costs more to
produce gas here than in the City, while
the plant needed to supply the territory
covered is fully as extensive as i in ban
Francisco. ; As . the amount disposed of
across the bay is? many times that used
here, it .is : believed that the rate ; there
could' be much lower than at preseni.
When gas was first introduced here it cost '
the a high \ price lof> $7 50 per. 1000. Kit wa^
gradually reduced until sin : October,: 1835,
the â¢ rate was ; made $2 per .'= 1000. and this
was ', thought "a very low price. As stated,
the company has ) not ' been i forced â¢to re

A fight is in progress for the presidency
<it the City Council. It has been stated
that William B. Pringle is certain to be
elected, but this is denied by some Coun
cilmen who are anxious to see W. D. Heiti
mann in that position. Regarding the
City Hall patronage, nothing definite is
as yet known, although there are multi
tudes of people out for each office.
Dr. Buckland, who will retire as Coun
ciVman from the Fifth Ward next month,
is anxious to be elected Health Officer, to
succeed Dr. Bradley. Dr. Buckiand, how
ever, has no claim on the Republican ad
ministration. He failed lo receive the
nomination for Councilman in the Repub
lican convention, ran independently and
drew enough strength from the Republi
can nominee to insure the elec ion of a
Democrat.
The Army and Navy Republican League
is a very busy body just now. At last
night's meetinsr four prominent members
were expelled for working against the Re
publican ticket in the last campaign.
Tliey were Colonel J. P. McElroy, liJward
McElroy, Ira Underwood and John L.
Roundy.
The oath of the league is: "To unite in
the active support of the principles of tne
Republican party and aid in tie election
of Republican municipal, Stale and Na
tional nominee?," The four expelled men
worked hard for A. CL Henry, an inde
pendent candidate lor Mayor, and nearly
succeeded in defeating Captain Thomas,
the regular Republican nominee, and a
respected veteran.
John A. Britton spent just $22 to secure
the largest vote for School D. rector.
H. D. Rowe, who was elected a Council
man from the Seventh Ward, spent but
$45 75 in printing. He could have spent
$48.
A. A. Bretz paid $20 to run as a Popu

The Federated Trades is anxious to be
set right before the public- in regard to
certain statements given O ut for publica
> tioQ and signed by F. J. Gregory, who
uses the title of secretary of the Federa
tion.
The Alameda County Federation of
Trades is the central body of unionized
labor in this county, and consists of duly
accredited delegates from every labor
union in good standing.
A few weeks ago many members of that
l oily, anxious to secure the election of can
didates who were known to be most favor
able to labor, joined tne Municipal Union
Labor Club. The federation took no part
aa a central body, which would have been
against their rule. F. J. Gregory tried to
besmirch the proceedings of the union
men by publishing a letter tryine to create
the impression that the union was in
politics.
The federation met, discussed the mat
ter, and decided to send the following
communication to the Examiner asking
that the matter be set right. The article
was as follows, but it was not printed in
the paper, which alone had published the
statement of Gregory :
An article published in the Examiner of yes
terday morning, signed by F. J. Gregory,
seeks to impress the minds of the people that
ne is secretary of the Federated Trades of Aia
meda County, and that he speAks author
itatively for that body. Mr. Gregory is not
secretary of the Federated Trades and is not
connected with it In any manner whatever.
lli-i connection with the iederation ceased
oyer a year ago. Tiie impress ion he is trying
to give out that the federation is in politics is
emiihftti.'il y denied, as no officer or member
of the federation hns been approached by auy
cnnciidaie for publ:c office. Tne federation
has taken no action directly or indirectly, and
absolutely absi-.ias from taking part in
political campaigns.
Further, it has in no way attempted to dic
tate to Its membership or its affi:iate<? bodies
what course they should pursue. It recog
nizes that each individual has a right to ex
ercise his rignt oi citizenship, and act in his
own way, without violating any obligation he
may owe to his union.
In the formation of the Municipal Union
Lubor Club the federation took no
part as a central body, while ail of
its members did, as ttiev bad a perfect
r ght to do. It is no part of a labor organiza
tion to interfere or restrict the rights which
are guaranteed to American citizens by the
constitution of the United States; and if a
number of citizens, members of trade organi
zations, see fit to lorm themselves into a po
litical club them is nothing in the constitu
tion oi organized labor to prevent, but, oa the
other hiiniJ, the study and discussion of econo
mic questions is recommended by the Ameri
can Federation of Labor. C. D. Rogers,
I'r . M'ient Aiameda County Federation of
Trades. M. A. Robeets,
Secretary Alameda County Federation of
Trades.
â¢'The only reason why the Examiner re
fused to publish the matter," said Presi
dent Rogers to-day, "was because Gregory
was making a right against Mayor Dave
and so was the Examiner, but this should
not have affected their attitude toward
the labor unions of Alameda County. It
was done to injure the Republican ticket
and was a very unworthy procedure."
C. D Rogers has always been an enthu
siastic Republican and was a very active
supporter of Captain Thomas, although
he never permitted the question of poli
tics to be mentioned at any meeting of the
union.
A. J. Read, an ex-president of the feder
ation and editor of (he Oakland Printer,
said to-day: ''The claim oi leadership of
organized labor by F. J. Gregory is en
tirely without foundation. He is not sec
retary ot the union, and although be has
tried on several occasions to be elected to
a minor position in his own union he has
;ailed.
"Tie only men who are eligible in this
city to lay any claim to t-uch an honor
able title, .in my opinion, are: C. D.
Roger*, president of the federation; R.
Wyand, ex-presiient of the Carpenters'
Union, and A. J. Gregg. In either ol

weeks, with the aid of several friends,
they secured just twelve votes from the
precinct in which they reside, and four ol
them came from their own house. Surely
that is leading backward, but of such are
the men who supply 'labor news' to the
Examiner."
MANUEL HAD REASONS.
Rev. C. H. Hobart's Charges of Foar of
a Boycott Denied by the
Councilman.
Oakland Office San Francisco Hall, >
908 Broadway, March 12. j
The exchange of courtesies and dis
courtesies between Rev. C. H. riobart ana
Councilman Manuel was increased by an
other chapter to-day.
Mr. Manual says that his position is
quite defensibl - and gives three reasons
lor acting as he did. He says first that the
ministers were undecided as to whether
they wanted absolute closing or Sunday
closing; secondly, the liquor men seemed
altogether too well satisfied to have both
questions submitted; thirdly, to have two
questions on the ballot would be so con
fusing that the result would mean
nothing. In conclusion Mr. Manuel says:
"You use the word boycott It is offen
sive to me and originated in the question
at issue among your own people. It has
no meaning. so far as lam concerned. If
the whisky men and all their relatives, to
gether with all the reverend clergy, saw fit
to boycott me in any business in which I
might be engaged it would not influence
my action or my vote officially one iota.
And I wantto say to you and to them that
if I swerved in the slightest decree from
what I conceived to be the path of duty on
accountof a threatened boyco.t, I would be
unworthy of the position I have held for
lour years past.
"In conclusion, Mr. Hobart. Your pedes
tal of morality may be painted a brighter
hue than mine, bnt your profession of
teaching men how to live would be better
taught by example than by precept. You
have wantonly charged wong where
wrong has not been done. You have, to a
certain extent, made retraction, but be it
known to you, retractions do noi always
retract, and in the present instance the
Bting is left behind to embitter tne hearts
of those who mignt otherwise be induced
to accept legislative office and be of great
assistance in the cause of morality and
temperance."

OUR GIRLS WANT
TO BE LIKE MEN
Scientific Discovery of a
Stanford Lady Psy
chologist.
Hundreds of Schoolgirls Write
That They Want to Be
Strong and Brave.
A New State Association to Help on
the Rising Tide of Child Study
in Home and School
A number of experts on children and
the study of them, and a larger number
interested therein, crowded one of the up
per halls of Native Sons' building from 3
to 5 P. M. yesterday, and helped launch
and impart momentum to another new
and larsie movement in child study.
"Child study" is spreading "apace,
largely guided from certain univer?itiesin
which psychologists are scientifically
studying child development with intensely
interesting results. Efforts to interest
mothers in systematic study of their
children are increasing, and the "life
book" is getting into the home.
The meeting yesterday was a result
of the Ion? hoping and planning of Mrs.
E. G. Greene, now of Santa Cruz, who is
well known in the educational world as a
Kindergartener here and in the East, and
who was once National superintendent of
that branch of the W. C. T. U.
She is engaged in forming a State asso
ciation, which shall organize mothers' and
teachers' clubs, and unite the work for
children being done by mothers' clubs,
kindergartens, universities, etc, and go
out along sev-ral lines of child study. It
is especially to establish a closer relation
between the home and the school.
The association has been quietly organ
ized in part with Mrs. Â£. G. Greene as
president, Mrs. Hester A. Harland as sec
retary and with a conAiittee of arrange
ments consisting of Miss Sarah D.
Hamlin. Miss E. A. Cleveland, Miss R. G.
Campbell, Miss F. Banning, Mm. M. L.
O'Neal ana Mr?. William Clarke. Many
educators of the universities and schools
attended yesterday.
The president opened the programme
with an account of the organization and
its aims, for which the time had but just
become ripe.
Several addresses followed, all bat the
first dealing with the subject in a general
way.
The first paper was on "Children's
Ideals," and in it Estelle M. Darran of
Stanford University gave an account of
interesting original research in the ideals
of children at different ages. With the
co-operation of teachers she had secured
1400 compositions by school children re
plying to the question, "What person of
whom you have heard or read would you
most like to Why?" Seven
hundred boys and 700 girls presented their
ideal*. They belonged to San Mateo
County schools and to two schools in St.
Paul. Tue study was into the effect of
history and literature on children and
into the influences which work on the
moral natures of children at different ages.
The results were quite as interesting as
have been the other similar investigations
ol the fears, wants, powers and concep
tions of thousands of children.
It was demonstrated by this scientific
process that our girls are slowly but
surely becoming masculine. This may
not be news, but it is interesting when
scientifically demonstrated. Girls nowa
days want to be brave. Professor Durragn
read some of the compositions. A 13-year
oid St. Pain girl wrote:
I beiieTe that I would rather resemble a man
thau a woman, because the deeds of woman,
although sometimes great, self-sacrificing and
brave, sink into insignificance when compared
â with the valorem deed 3of man. Napoleon
Bonaparte in my fancy is a hero of heroes.
Tben there was a 10-year-old girl who
wrote:
I would lfke to resemble Barbra Fichey.
Wny? Because she was such a brave lady,
and you know there are not very many brave
ladies.
These were only two. The percentage
of the total girlish wish to be strong and
brave impelled the psychologist to ob
serve:
In closing I wish to leave one question with
yon. The zeitgrist is surely anu irresistibly
impelling o;ir girls to an absorption of charac
terics hitherto deemed masculine. Co-educa
tion is undoubtedly greatly accelerating this
consummation. Are we prepared to see drop
ping out of womanhood, because no longer
emphasized, the patience and gentleness and
Beli-sacrifice and domesticity with which our
mothers sweetened our childhood? If not,
then we must surely embody them in the per
son of some of those "brave ladies" admired by
our St. Paul girL Have we the historical ma
terial for such presentation?
The composition of Frank Gadina, 13
years, of San Mateo Coun iy, and of for
eign birth, was given as significant. Little
FranK wrote:
The one whom I should like to resemble
most is George Washington, because he was
brave, honest, and, moreover, he freed his
country without taking pay for his valuable
Bsrvices. He was also the one that formed the
cons'itution of. the honored country he had
saved.
Thia and others showed that children of
foreign birth become Americanized in the
rnbl.c schools and acquire American
ideals. Most boys want to die for their
country.
Dr. Thomas P. Bailey of the State Uni-
Tersity made a p;ea that "scientific"
child-stady be left largely to :he psycholo
gists by the mothers. He advised patents
to write down simple observations of their
children rather t an follow ;ho syllabi of
the psychologist that the intuitive,
thoughtful work of the mother be no*
lost. The most valuable work in child-
Btuiiy could be done by two or three
parents studying their own children and
comparing notes.
Su^an Howe, late of Cornell University
and now of Stanford, spoke on "The Value
of Chid Study to the Nurse," and Mrs. A.
J. Cruzan on "The Educational Value of
Music."
Millicent Sninn spoke interestingly, and
said that everything a chili does is an
indication of its physical, intellectual or
psychical nature, ifothers should watch
their children and record their observa
tion- by motner's coninipn-sen.be methods.
Dr. Harriet Maxson of St. Helena, read
a paper on "Th*- Hygiene of Adolescence,"
and Madison Bibcock closed the pro
grnmme with some fitting words.
The State Association will be definitely
named ami organized at the Occidental
Hotel at 3 p.m. next Mondny, and child
study will receive still another impetus.
GEOEZINGER TO BE REVIEWED
Fresiriiiif: Judge Seawell SnyÂ« That Is
the Way to Settle a Dispute
Presiding Judge Soawell yesterday,
handed down a decision in the case of J.
6. Reid against Justice of the Peace Groe
unger, granting the petition of the plain
tiff for a writ of review. The dispute
arose out of the entering of judgment by
Judge Groezinger in a case at issue.
Attorney diaries Wes'ey Reed makes
affi lavit that Judce Groezinger al eied his
docket to the detriment of his client, J. S.
Reid, making a judgment rend tor $L' 250
when it ought to be $143 70. nnd that he d.d
o at the request of Bier & Reeensberper ;
fliat Groezinger is unutr heavy political
obligations to Bier & Re^ensberÃer, and
that He does everything in his power to
assist bis friends Bier & Regen!>berger.
The ca*e was presented to Judge Sea
weil on the affidavits of the different per
sons interested, and -they were so greatly
at variance that the court declined to de
cide the case without a full hearing of tes
timony on both sides. For this reason
the writ of review waÂ« ordered issued.
THE STOCK MARKET.

At California Hall this evening will be

Metropolitan Hall on the evening of Sat

The sub-committees have labored earn

Tli;it there will be a spontaneous out

that is eager to give some token of its

SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD.
The Body of William Freese Found
in Golden Gate
Park.
The body of a man, supposed to be that
of William Freese, was found lying near
the Six h-avenue entrance to Go;den Gats
Park by Lou:s Drescb, who resides at 2930
Fulton street, last evening. A bullet
â wound in the right temple surrounded by
black powder burns and a revolver iyiue
ne-T ihe body told the story of a suicide.
The Coroner's ofh>e was notified and
Deputy Coroners Tyrrell and Mclnnis re
moved the body to the Morgue. When it
waÂ« searched a key-ring bearing the name
William Freese, corner of O'Farrell and
Taylor streets, and a watch were found.
Nn paper or document that would tend to
throw any light on the life of the de
ceased or the motive that prompted him
to take his own life was found. It is pre
sumed, however, judging irom the condi
tion of the deceased's wearing apparel,
that poverty was the cause of this suicide.

LIFE AND DEATH
OF GUSTAV SUTRO
Brief Sketch of a Prominent
Pioneer Just Passed
Away.
Was the Originator of the
Streetcar Transfer
System.
'he Firm of Which He Was Presi
dent Dealt Extensively in
Municipal Securities.
The kindly face of Gustav Sutro, the
banker ana linguist, will never again be
seen by his many friends on Montgomery
street. He died at his residence, 1718 Pine
street, on Thursday night.
The deceased was well known in San
Francisco, where he had resided almost
continuously since 1853, at which time he
started a cigar-store on Montgomery street,
GUSTAVE SUTRO, Banker and Broker, Who Died Thursday
Night.
in front of the then well-known saloon of
Barry & Patton, with his cousin, Adolph
Sutro, the ex-Mayor of this City.
Leaving there, he went to Victoria, B. C,
and engaged, in a similar business with his
brother, the late Erail Sutro. Returning
again to San Fiaucisco, he formed a co
partnership with his brother, Charles
Sutro, in the banking and brokerage busi
ness at 418 Montgomery street, where he
remained until his death.
In this business the firm dealt exten
sively in municipal bonds, and in the
handling of such securities be became an
expert and authority. This valuable
knowledge came to him from early train
ing, for after leaving school he entered the
banking-house founded by his father in
Aii-la-Chapelle in the early part of the
century. He was there thoroughly trained
for the line of business he chose in after
life.
In addition to bis banking and broker
age business he was identified in other
pursuits which tended to develop the
City, especially in the outside districts.
In the seventies he purchased a control
ling interest in the old Omnibus Railroad
Company, then a borsecar line, and be
came i<s president. Under his manaee
ment the Omnibus Cable Company was
organized mid the system converted into
a cable line, which soon became the most
extensive in this City.
The deceased will always be remembered
with gratitude by the public of this City,
for under his management ot the Omnibus
the system of general translers on the
streetcar lines of this City was originated.
In fact, be forced the Market-street Rail
road and the other railroad companies to
adopt that system. Mr. Sutro continued
president of the Omnibus Cable Company
until it was consolidated with the .Market
street and other linos.
He was also one of the founders of the
California Electric Light Company, which
under his management grew into the
powerful Edison Light and Power Com
pany, which was lately consolidated into
the Ban Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany. He was also prominently identified
with the powder manufacturing interest*
of this coast. He was president of tno old
Safety Nitro Powder Company and
brought about its consolidation with the
Giant Powder Company. He was also a
charter member of the Stock and Bond
Exchange of San Francisco, holding his
seat up to the time of his death.
The deceased was a brother of Charle3
and Albert Sutro of this City and of El
vira Gradwod hi of Albany, N. V., and a
brother-in-law of Herman Zadig, the
stockbroker of this City, whose sister he
married in Hamburg, Germany, in Octo
ber. 1864.
Mr. Sutro was a man of polish and cul
ture, as everything about his late resi
dence indicates. He received a good

education in the High Scuool of his na
tive city and became very proficient in his
studies. When only 16 years of age he
could speak, read and write German,
French, Spanish and English.
The funeral will be held from his late
residence to-morrow afternoon at half
past 1 o'clock.
BILLIARD TOURNANENT.
The Amateur George Heinloke Suc
cumbed to Stage Fright
Last Night.
George Heinicke, the only man in the
amateur class in this State who is said to
be the equal of A. Mitchell at the 14-inch
balk-line billiards, made bis debut Jast
night in the lournament now in progress
at the Occidental Hotel.
The audience was a critical one, but
more than anything else it was a tre
mendous one and Hemicke suffered great
ly from stage fright.
The first game of the evening was in
teresting in the extreme. Frank Moroney
and John J. Roggen, both 200-point play
ers, came together. From ..he spot shot
Moroney ran up against the hardest kind
of luck and it followed him through the
game.
His anxiety to bring the trophy back to
the Olympic Club unnerved him, and
Roggen left him behind as if he was at a
standstill.
Captain Williams, who Is to present the
winners with the cues and other parapher
nalia at the close of the tournament in
behalf of the donors, the Brunswick-
Balke-Coilender Company, is an intimate
friend oi Moronev's and he had wagered
co less than five bats that he would make
the largest run in the game.
Roggen's best was 21 points, topping
Moroney by ten points until the last
inning, when Moroney completed a clever
run of 41 points in cushion-carom shots.
His average was 3. 70 with a score of 166.
Roggen, thn winner, averaged 4.44 with
a score ol 200.
POISON LURKS IN FUNGI.
Professor W. A. Setchell Lee
lures on Mushrooms and
Toadstools.
How a Distinc ioa May Be Drawn
Between the Edible and Poison*
cus Varieties.
The sad triple tragedy which occurred
in the Fastine family but a few weeks ago
as the result of a mistake in the use of
fungi, prompted the reading of an es-.
pecially interesting and instructive paper
on "Toadstools and Mushrooms," by Dr.
W. A. Setcbell, professor of botany in the
University of California, at the Calitornia
State l-'ioral Sociey yesterday afternoon.
Af er some introductory remarks, the
professor addnssed himself directly to the
question of bow to distinguish a mush
room from ft. toadstool. He said in part:
A botanical rule which is fairly 'crtaln, is
this: Avoid eating those species which have
a volva, a ring and white gill*. The volva is
au outer covering inclosing the whole toad
stool when y>ung, but rupturing as the cap
and stem expand and remaining at the base o!
the stem as a t>ort of sack. Tnere is no mis
taking this structure in ' 'Amanita phalloides,"
but in a "muscarla," however, the volva fits
tightly to the bulbous base of the stem and is
much less conspicuous.
A portion of this volva may be seen at ma
turity Miil adhering to the upper surface of
the cap in the form of scales. The ring is sit
uated upon the stem and is simply a portion
left behind when the cap, which in the
younger stages is adherent to the stem, rup
tures and frees itself from it. These struc
tures then, the ring and the volva, in connec
tion with the white gills, are the characteris
tics of the species of amanita, which are all,
with one exception, the most poisonous of all
the toadstools.

EXPERTS AT THE
WATER INQUIRY
Colonel Mendell and J. S.
Emery Gave Evidence
Last Night.
A Diminution Shewn in the
Cost of Construction
of Works.
Schussler Holds That This Is Smaller
Than Statedâ lnvestigation
Nearly Over.
Supervisors did not continue the water
rates investigation so long as usual last
nieht, but adjourned soon alter 10 o'clock.
The explanation of this is that they have
to rise betimes this morning in ordes to
visit the plant of the Spring Valley Water
Company in accordance with a previous
arrangement. Those of the board who in
tend to make the trip will start from the
depot at Third and Townsend streets at
8:15 o'clock.
Before going into committee of the
whole to pursue the investigation Super
visor Smitn moved that M. A. Gunst,
Police Commissioner, be granted ten days'
leave of absence, commencing March 13.
The motion was carried unanimously.
The board then resolved itself into a
committee of the whole with Dr. Dodge
in the chair.
Dr. Clinton asked the company's repre
sentatives to give the amount of stock
issued and by wuom held, and the
amount of dividends paid during the ye* r.
Attorney Kellogg said that the com
pany had already lurnished a reply to
part of this question, but must reluse to
make public the names of tne stock
holders.
Dr. Clinton then moved that this part
of the question be referred 10 the Water
Committee.
Supervisor Smith moved, as an amend
ment, that it be laid on the table, lie did
not tii ink that this information concerned
the public.
Dr. Clinton withdrew his motion and
seconded the amendment on tne under
standing that the books of the company
would be accessible to the members of
the board.
The amendment, however, was subse
quently withdrawn as unnecessary, uor
was the original motion put.
Dr. Clinton said he understood that the
company claimed that all its realty, of
whatever nature, entered into the supply
of water to the City.
Engineer Schussler said that certain
property whicti had been necessary in
lormer years for this purpose wfs no long
er put to that use. He instanced the old
Market street and Fotrero reservoirs and
land in Calav ras Valley. In the last
named case, though tnis property was not
directly utilized, it helped to guarantee
the purity of the watershed sources, and
wouid subsequently be nerviceaDle for
reservoir purposes. There was also some
property containing springs in Marin
County, from wbicu tne ships were sup
plied. Finally there were a few lots at
.North Beach. A good deal of this prop
erty could be disposed of at a lar^e ad
vance when the bonds matured.
Replying to questions propounded by
Dr. Kottanzi ana Dr. Clinton, Mr. Scuua
sler said that evaporation and absorption
reduced the DOSBible supply from Cala
veras Valley below that obtainable from
Alanieda Creek.
The land in the Calaveras Valley would
be incidentally a good thing at some fu
ture date. The company paid about $200,
--000 for 4200 acres of land In that vicinity.
They were obliged to purchase tbi^ prop
erty along with the Alameda water rights
from the Alameda Water Company. The
witness himself was instrumental in
negotiating the deal, because he recog
nized that ths Calavera-s property would
ultimately furnish the key to the eneire
situation. The Market and Brannan
street lots were a necessary purchase at the
time for the purpose of supply.
Tne old Dipe line, the Market-street
property and the construction thereon
counted in the company's total of cost.
The property would be sod the moment
the bonds matured in 1906. Meanwhile it
was continually increasing in value.
The Market-street lot originally cost about
$25,000. Tne old Market-street reservoir
was constructed in 1856 or 1857, before his
connection with the company. It would
be impossible for him to give the propor
tion of cost which this property bore to
the entire property. Being pledged to the
bondholders it was only tight that it
should be preserved for their security.
Colonel George H. Men .ell, who in 1877
furnished the City with a report on ttiÂ«
sources of water supply in the Sierras,
took the stand after being duly sworn. At
the time he maile this report he was
attached to the engineer corps of the
United States army. He deposed thai he
still believed, as he did then, that a large
supply of water could be procured from
those sources.
Mayor Fbelan, quoting from the
colonel's report, said lie must suppose that
there was no question as lo the abundance
and superiority of that supply.
The witness said that he did not care to
institute comparisons. He drank Spring
Valley water and found it very good,
though he admitted that he filtered it
beforehand.
"In 1877," said the Mayor, "you stated
that 22,000,000 gallons could be supplied at
a cost of $18,999,000."
The wiiues said a part of the report had
reference to the offer of the Bine Lakes
company, and that estimate was some
thins; less than his own. But a pipe line
to-day would certainly cost less than lor
merly. Iron cost 4 cents a pound in 1877,
and was now less than 3 cents. Tins
meant a difference of $20 a ton for every
ton of iron used. For every red lection of
1 cent an inch in the prue of iro-Â«. there
would be a total reduction of $1,i80,000 in
the total cost of iron used in the construc
tion of a plant. Labor, he presumed, was
also much dearer then than now.
"Then we may safely draw the conclu
sion," queried the Mayor, "that if the
City could be applied for $18,000,000
then, it could be supplied for considerably
less io-day?"
The witness replied affirmatively. He
added that this particular report was made
for the purpose of comparing various
projects of supply, so tuat tne City could
nee which was the most advantageous.
Its value, therefore, was really in the way
of comparison. There was* no doubt that
any particular piece of work mentioned in
this report could be done more cheaply to
day than twenty years ago. A lii>iu pres
sure, he said, was indispensable to furnish
supply Irom thosÂ» sources.
A highly technical dialogue ensued be
tween the Mayor und the witness relative
to pressure, pumping, syphons, levels,
etc., at the conclusion ot which the wit
ness gave some interesting details con
cerning the water-sheds below San Jose
which he had recently visited.
The area which might possibly be con
trolled at Laguna Seca, ior example, was
about 200 square miles. In the event of
this control being obtained 25,000,000 gal
lons of water might be drawn from those
sonrces.
He was unable to answer a question pro
pounded by Dr. Clinton, as to the addi
tional cost above $18,000,000 that would be
involved in case the possible supply from
the Siorras was increased from 22,000,000
to 50.000,000.
J. 6. Emery, ex-president of the Blue
Lakes Water Company, w;is next sworn.
He could not tell, he said, why the Super
visors formerly refused to entertain his
company's offer to supply the City. The
company now supplied the mines in the
Blue Lakes neighborhood and was con
sidering a proposition to supply Stockton.
He corroborated Colonel Mendell's evi
dence, that water could be supplied more
cheaply to-day than formerly. His com
pany would have no difficulty in supply
ing the City of San Francisco with
50,000,000 {,'aflons a day if necessary. He
could not say how the Blue Lakes water
compared with that of the Spring Valley
Water Works. His company's main source
of supply was melted snow.
Mayor Phelan referred to the fact that
the city of Manchester, England, was sup
plied by an aqueduct ninety-five miles
long, carrying water from Thirlmere at a
cost of $17,000,000.
The witness said that there was no
trouble in carrying water more than 100
miles.
The Mayor asked it the witness would
care to make the board' an offer to supply
the City with water, and Colonel Mendell
replied that he could not do so without
consulting the directors. Continuing he
stated that the diminution in the cost of
material since 1877 was almost 50 per cent
Dr. Clintonâ Then if the cost of con
struction was $19,000,000 twenty years ago
similar work could be done to-day for
$14,000,000?
The witness said he could not under
take to answer such a question without
studying the relative cost of each class of
material.
Mr. Schussler resumed his familiar seat
and was asked if he knew anything about
the sources of supply below San Jose.
Replying to this question he affirmed
that the utilization of those sources
would necessitate pumping and the con
struction of reservoirs at different eleva
tions.
Before the committee rose he made a
voluntary statement apropos of Mr.
Emery's testimony. The members, he
said, had. contrived to create an impres
sion during their examination of Mr.
Emery that the lower price of steel twenty
years ago had enormously reduced the
cost of construction of these mountain
schemes. But in the first place the price
of labor had not gone down since then,
nor was the price of metal the greatest
part of the cost of a pipe line.
It was only one of the many items.
There were the metal, rivets, the con
struction, transportation, digging of
trenches and the covering of the same.
The cost of rights of way had increased
considerably. Twenty years aeo the cost
of the completed metal construction
would be between B]4 and 9 cents a pound
on the ground; now it was b3tween 6 and
â¢ i) a ' cents. These mountain schemes were
ail right, when needed, but there was
plenty of good water near the City, and
why not utilize it, especially when, as
Colonel Men ieil had stated, the utilization
of the Sierra sources would necessitate
resorvoirs to tide over the dry seasons.
The committee then rose and reported
progress.
Dr. Clinton said he believed that another
session would complete the investigation.
The committee will meet again on Friday
evening next.
An error in the last report of the water
rates investigation made the advertising
expenses of th â¢ water company read $51 00J
instead of $50X), which is, of course, the
correct amount.
OPIUM MAY BE RELEASED
Foote s Opinion to the Treas
ury Department on the
Subject.
Special Agent; Will Make a Desperate
Effort to Have the Drug Held
in Bend
The special treasury agents who have
been working up the evidence against the
$200,000 worth of opium that was recently
tied up in the bonded warehouses by Col
lector of the Port Wise were very much
chagrined yesterday when United States
D strict Attorney Foote reported ad
versely on the case.
The District Attorney's action took the
form of a telegram to the Secretary of the
Treasury, in which he stated that, in his
opinion, condemnation proceedings would
fail, and that therefore he would advise
that the opium be released. This destroys
a month's work on the part of the special
agents, unless they can convince the
Treasury Department that they have a
case against the drug.
The agents received information that
Chinese hrms of this City were violating
the laws and the treity with China in im
porting opium into this country and
thinly concealing their onerations by
having the opium consigned to an em
ploye of a local branch of a foreign bank.
They worked on the case for a tsme and
claimed to have dis oven-d a contract by
which the bank clerk acted as the agent
of Quong Fong fai & Co., the Chinese
opium-dealers of Chinatown. They con
sulted the District Attorney, and he ex
pressed an opinion, without having looked
closely into the matter, that the opium
conid be condemned.
On the siren th of this Collector Wise
was asked to order that the last big im
portation be kept, in the warehouses pend
ing the settlement of the matter.
This was done, and the agents also
seized a portion of the shipment that had
been taken to Chinatown and placed it in
the Appraiser's store.
Then the agents placed the facts in the
hands of the Collector officially, and that
individual, after looking them over care
fully, placed the case officially before the
United States District Attorney, request
ing him if the facts warranted to file an
iniormaiion against the opium.
After going exhaustively into the sob*
ject, Mr. Foote decided that the evidence
was not sufficient to render a condemna
tion reasonably sure, and so wired the
Secretary of tee Treasury.
The opium lias not vet been released,
but wtll doubtless b> freed soon, unless
further inst notions to hold it are received
from Washington. It is understood that
the special agents will make desperate
efforts to prevent the opium from leaving
the warehouses until the question of the
legality of us importation is aettled in
court.

BUTLER'S
LAST THROW
He Begs Six Grains of
Morphine to End
His Life.
CONFESSES THAT THE
JIG IS UP.
He Prefers Death to Facing
Australian Legal Yen
. geance.
A NEWSPAPER MAN APPEALED
TO FOR AID.
Tho Murderer Repudiates His Con
versation, but Admits an Inten>
tien to Commit Suicid?.
Through the tangle and confusion of
legal forms and procedure the Austral'an
niuraerer is at last beginning to get a
glimpse of the fate which awaits him. It
is a disheartening prospect, and Butler
apparently sees but one way to defeat it.
He will fight death with death. Rather
the deadly sleeping potion than the ruth
less hemp, and the murderer of Weller and
Preston is scheming to accomplish bis
own destruction.
Among thosn who have been closest to
Butler within the last week or two it has
been very apparent that his nerve was
weakening, but it was not until yesterday
that it became known that he had made
overt efforts to obtain the means of his
own undoing. This knowledge came to
the officers through Butler's appeals to a
newspaper man to furnish him with mor
phine.
Among the representatives of the local
papers who became acquainted with the
Australian murderer in the course of num
erous interviews was a representative of
the .Post, with whom Butler became quite
friendly. This was, perhaps, largely due to
the fact that the newspaper man, pi;yine
the apparent hopelessness of the prison
er's position, furnished him with news
papers and other little conveniences.
Thursday afternoon Butler addressed a
note to tbe Post editorial rooms request
ing that the reporter in question be sent
to see him. This request was complied
with and Bulier voluntarily entered into
a long and confidential discussion of his
situation. It was obvious that he was
discouraged and he Intimated that all was
over with him. In the course of his con
versation he banded tbe newspaper man
a document which be declared was hia
will, together with other important papers.
As he did this he looked meaningly at his
confidant and said:
â¢ You see, it's this way. The jig is up.
They've got me and they'll take me back to
Australia. But I Know what will be done
to me there, and I will not go. All I need
is six grains of morphine. I'll go to sleep
and that will be ihe last of the Butler
case."
The reporter, who had accepted the
document in a spirit of kindliness, w.v
taken back at the implied request. With
due regard for the confidence that had
been reposed in him he considered it his
duty to notify the officers of their
prisoner's desperate intention, and he
spoke of the matter to Detectives Mc-
Hattie and Roach. That is why a guard
has been planed in Butler's cell, and every
visitor from this on will be watched
suspiciously.
It is this last feature of the disclosure
that chafes the prisoner. He indignantly
denied that he had made any confidence
to the Post man, or thai he had spoken of
committing suicide while here.
"I may have said in my conversation,"
he admitted, "that if everything goes
against me on the other side I may try to
commit suicide. The publication of that
story will make me a watched man when
I net there, and that is the reason it has
given me a great deal of trouble." He re
iterated emphatically that he gave the
Post reporter no papers, nor in any way
made a confidant of him.
