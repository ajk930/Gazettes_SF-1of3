CANEA, Crete, April B.â The Turkish
garrison at Kiss-amo is extremely anxious
to retire from that place, believing that in
the event of an attack by Christians the
position will not be tenable. The insur
gents notified the foreign admirals yester
day of their intention to attack tne fort at
Kissamo, and it was understood re-enforce
ments would be sent to the Turkish troops
there. ThÂ»*re seems, however, to have
been a change in the plans. It was stated
to-day that, instead of sending further
troops to attempt 10 hold the fort, a war
ship would be dispatched to Kissamo for
the purpose of embarking Moslem troops
there, who would evacuate the position
as soon as furnished with the means.
TRADE WITH TRANS-PACIFIC COUNTRIES.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April B.â "Jim" Hill, president of the
Great Northern, has written a letter to one of the North Dakota Sena
tors touching on the tariff question and incidentally points out the
possibilities of trade in China and Japan. Hill suggests that the tariff
rates in the Dingley bill be so adjusted as not to cut off trade with
trans-Pacific countries. In his letter he says that Asiatic trade is of
the greatest importance to this country, and particularly such portions
of it as are interested in wheat-growing. "A year ago last fall," he
says, "wheat in the Palouse Valley, south of Spokane, sold for 18 and
20 cents per bushel. To-day the same wheat brings 65 and 70 cents.
The province of Amoy alone, which is near the coast, contains 80,000,
--000 people, and at twenty pounds of flour per capita yearly would
consume 40,000,000 bushels of wheat. The large districts of Tientsin
and Shanghai are both easily accessible from the sea and would con
sume about as much more." Hill suggests that growers could ship
wheat from Devils Lake to the Pacific Coast for this trade.
The insurgents have notified the ad
mirals that they will forcibly repel liny
attempt o! warships to interfere with the
design to capture Kis>samo. It is as
sumed that the insurgents will turn their
guns on the warships if the latter fire on
them.
The condition of the Mussulmans, who
have been besieged for a lone time at
Bitia, in the eastern part of the island, is
becoming desperate. They are in great
went, the scarcity of water causing mucn
suffering, particularly among women and
children. The wells in the town are ut
terly incapable of furnishing the supply
necessary, and when the Mussulmans ven

by the powers, this morning held a con
ference with the Consuls of >everal na

every light, and the conclusion reached
was that there was no probability of sue-

will go to Retimo on his own initiative
and try to arrange a meeting with the
chiefs of the insurgents, to whom he will

THOUSANDS BATTLE WITH THE
BREAKING LEVEES.
In the V zoo Delta District There Is
a Pro pet of the Worst Suffering
Ev.r Knwn There.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., April B.â The con
dition of affairs in the flood districts of
the Mississippi Valley is beyond the power
of words to describe. The situation as out
lined yesterday in President McKinley'a
message to Congress far surpasses any
previous experiences. The flood region is
not only more extensive, but from Cairo
down the waters have reached a higher
*tage tban ever known before, and the
worst is yet to come in many place;, es
pecially Louisianaâ from the mouth of
Red River down â where a desperate tight
is now being made to stiengtben and hold
the levees against the steadily rising
waters.
This state of affairs does not come or go
in a day, but lasts for weeks or even
months. In the great flood of 1858 the
water at Memphis stood within one foot
or its highest mark for eighty consecutive
days, and the flood that overspread the
St. .Francis and Yazoo districts took sixty
days lo run off.
Above Cairo tbe floods in the main river
and its tributaries while very destructive
in certain localities are not so widespread,
being confined to tbe narrow bottom* and
valleys bordering those streams. Below
the case is very different. The alluvial
region or flood district proper 01 the Mis
sissippi begins a short distance above
Cairo, 111.; at Cape Girardeau, Mo., and
Paducah, Ky., and with a varying breadth
of from twenty to eighty miles, extends to
the Gulf of Mexico. Through thin the
river winds its tortuous length of some
1200 miles on tbe summit of a iow ridge
which it has built up. sometimes inclining
to tbe bluff on trie cant side and again to
those on tbe west. The land sloping back
from its banss to the hisrh ground bring
its surface trom five to thirty feet beiow
the level of the river.
At three points between Cairo and the
month of Red River â New Madrid, Mo.,
Helena, Ark., and Natchez. Miss. â the
high ground on both sidÂ«s approaches the
river, and narrowing the alluvial plain
forms three great flood reservoirs, as it
were, into which the waier backs up from
the main river, or unable to pa^t through
the narrow space between the levees at
these points breaks over and floods the
whole country to a greater or less depth.
In previous flood years sometimes one and
sometimes another of toes* districts have
escaped with very little damage. Only on
a few previous occasions â  aye all three
been disastrously flooded at the same time.
The water now stands, However, in all
three to a greater height than ever known
before, and each must thus lend its aid as
a receiving reservoir and hold the excess
of water unable to pass through the nar
row spaces at the points above mentioned
until the t-'X on the main channel is les
sened. This may be two months hence.
from the Cairo, or upper pool, the
noodwater can find its way around the
New Madrid ridges to the headwaters of the
St. Francis River, or through RnlfoolLnke
and River to the next pool below. This
includes the basin of the St. Francis, some
10.600 square ruile* in extent, all the coun
try between it and the big river, exctpt
two small nieces of high ground, and all
the low grounds along the Abion, Hatcher
and othrr rivers on the Tennessee side. It
can hold a vÂ«s( amount of water and has
been known to flood until its waters, rising
higher than those in the main river, broke
over the levees from the west until they
were washed away or submerged. The
lev es on the east side, between Memphis
and Helena, are very high and generally
suffice to hold the flood in the St. Francis
reservoir until the water in the main
river goes down. Y"t, on this occasion,
they have broken both nbnve and below
Helena and flooded the Yazoo Delta coun
try, but affording no relief to the flooded
district above.
From Vicksburg to Baton Rouge, La.,
the river hugs the bluff â > ou the east side
and the aUuvini plain narrows at Natchez
to some eighteen miles, spreading below,
over to and up the Red River. When this
stream is low the surpius flood from the
Mississippi can go by Atcbafalaya Teche
and other bayous over a short route to the
gulf, relieving the country below from
danger. The conditions now prevailing,
however, are such that this avails but little
and the danger of flood threatens the
whole country on botli sides down to N -w
Orleans and over to that city itself, which
is likely to have an experience worse than
when it was inundated some years ago.
The Mississippi, with its many bayous
and tributaries, is well leveed throughout
the alluvial regions. These vary in height
and distance from the natural bank of the
stream in the different localities and ac
coiding to the width of the stream. As a
rule the section between them is more
than double that of the river at the ordi
nary stage of water. Tne laws of Louisi
ana, Mississippi and Arkansas provide for
constant inspection of these during and
after high water, and keeping tiiem some
distance â one to three feet â above the
height of the highest flood. All tbs
levees below the mouth of the Arkansas
River have been strengthened and raised
since the flood of 1803, the highest ever
known: but it avails little against the
present flood. The conditions are unprece
dented.
The total area of the Mississippi baÂ«in is
1.256.000 square miles, in which 80,400,000,
--000,000 cubic tot of water fall annually;
25 per cent of this, or 22,500,000,000,000,

rate of 675,000 cubic feet per second. The

UNIVERSITY BONDS ARE MISSING.
CHICAGO, ILL., April 8. â Endowment bonds to the value of over $400,000 belonging to the Uni
versity of Illinois are missing. They were intrusted to C. W. Spalding, president of the Globe Savings
Bank, which closed Monday. Spalding was treasurer of the university, and as such held over $140,000 in
cash and between $400,000 and $500,000 in endowment bonds. A secret session of the trustees of the
university was held to-day at the Sherman House to hear the report of a sub-committee appointed to com
municate with Spaldiag and secure information as to the funds. When the session ended, almost three
hours later, the faces of the members bore unmistakable signs of great agitation.
Although no member of the board would commit himself, it is learned that the situation is most seri
ous so far as the university is concerned. Spalding has been much in demand by the trustees, but could
not be found. It was claimed by them before the meeting opened this morning that a messenger had been
dispatched to ascertain the exact whereabouts of the banker and also to obtain a statement from him.
President McKay of the Board of Trustees admitted that the board is absolutely in the dark so far as the
$400,000 endowment bonds are concerned. Of this amount $200,000 worth of bonds are said to be nego
tiable, while the remainder are stamped in such a manner as to make it next to impossible to hypothecate
them. The only information that could be gleaned from the trustees after the meeting to-day was the
assurance that not all of the $140,000 cash funds were in the hands of Spalding when the Globe Savings
Bank failed. Spalding wÂ»6 appointed .treasurer of the board at the solicitation of ex-Governor Altgeld.

IESTIMOSY OF BRUTALITY NOT

Patriots Have Thoroughly Organized

Be Recogniz d.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April B.â The
war in Cuba occupied the attention of the
Senate for nearly two hours to-day. It
came up in the morning hour in tne shape
of the joint resolution introduced by Mor
gan last Thursday, declaring that a state
of 'war exists and that the United States
will accord belligerent rights in its ports
and territory to forces on both sides.
Morgan presented an argument in sup
port of the joint resolution in a dispas
sionate tone and with much less than the
usual bitter invective against Spanish rule.
Lie related several of the recent outrages
perpetrated in Cuba against American
citicens tnere, and spoke of American
citizens in Cuban prisons. He said if
their history there could be lead to the
Senate it would excite in that body a feel-
ing of the most intense indignation. He
asked bow the United States could enjoy
the respect of its own citizens if it stood
by and saw fT^n one American suffer at
toe hands of the Spanish Government.
Contrary to treaty, contrary to interna
tional law and contrary to sacred rights
of humanity, Americans, he said, were
kept languishing in loathsome dungeons2
without so much as a protest from this
Government.
Morgan read from the testimony taken
before the sub-Committee on Foreign
Relations, but said some of it could not be
read without hurting even the delicacy of
men and driving all women out of the gal
leries. The only real burst of indignation
Morgan indulged in was when he declared
that if only one American instead of
seventy-four were subjected to the out
races he mentioned the United States flag
that was not u>ed to protect him was no
better than a rag.
In conclusion, he said that the testi
mony submitted by him to-day would be
followed when ho next took the floor with
proofs that a revolutionary government
in Cuba was thoroughly organized into a
civil government, enacting laws and main
taining a thoroughly organized arm 3.
The rest of the session was devoted to
the consideration of the bankruptcy bill,
Nelson of Minnesota arguing in support
of the substitute offered by him, confining
the law to cases of voluntary bankruptcy.
Neleon declared belief that the passage of
a suitable tariff bill was a crying need of
the hour. His substitute might not be
perfect, but it was an effort in the right
direction. He thought the present a most
inopportune time to press the oanicruptcy
bill. When good times returned the per
manent bankruptcy law should be passed.
Hoar, in charge of the Torrey bill, said
that Nelson's substitute would not meet
the existing need. There were 500.000
poor debtors in the country waiting lor a
bankruptcy bill, and their cases could be
best met by the bill reported by the Judi
ciary Committee.
The movement for the reorganization of
committees, which was started a few days
ago, received an impetus to-day from a
proposition by Chandler, fixing April 20
as the time for putting it into execution.
The matter went over ontil to-morrow.
The Senate at 4 r. m. went into execu
tive session, and at 4:45 r. m. adjourned

XegoHatlno for a Art* Loan to Carry on

HAVANA, Cuba, April B.â The Spanish
Government is neeotiating with a syndi
cate of English bankers for a new loan,
by means of which tbe war may be main
tained in Cuba until the Corte^ decides
upon some other way of obtaining money.
It is not yet known whether English
bankers have agreed to the proposals of
Spain, but negotiations are being earned
on in London because the bankers at
Paris have refused to make any more
loans. The money asked for by the
Spanish agents is $_'0,000,000 and they
offer 6 per cent interest and for payment
of capital provide a sinking fund which
will bs paid every three months with in
terest.
A dispatch from Madrid says tbe Gov
ernment has decided to issue, in concert
â¢with the Bank of Spain, a loan of 50.000,
--000 pesetas, which may. if deemed neces
sary, be increased to 100,000,000 pesetas, to
be used in meeting the expenses of war.
It is expected that the Cortes will also
vote further financial aid to the Govern
ment. Later a great loan will be proposed
for the purpose of consolidating the float
ing debt and meeting the old obligations.
Doubt is expressed here as the success of
these financial plans.

IN A DILEMMA
Peculiar Bids Made for
Armor Plates for
Battle- Ships.
The Result Due to the Maximum

None of the Prominent Armor. Plate
Manufacturers of the Country
Submit Proposa s.
"WASHINGTON, D. C, April 8.-There
were many surprised people at the Navy
Department to-day when bids were opened
for supplying the Government with 8000
tons of armor for the battle-ships Ala
bama, Illinois and Wisconsin. It was the
first opportunity of the department to test
the attitude of the armor-plate manufac
turers with regard to the stipulation in
the naval appropriation bill that the aver
a;-'e cost of armor should aot be more than
$300 per ton.
Secretary Long announced that one bid
only had been received. When the so
called bid was examined it was found to
be in the form of two propositions from
the Illinois Steel Company, but neither
was in conformity with the advertise
ment. Both of these propositions will be
rejected. The company offered to furnish
8000 tons at J3OO per ton on condition that
Congress would award it tbe contract for
the entire wants of tbe United States Gov
ernment for armor-plate lor twenty years.
If this were done the firm would furnish
the material at $240 a ton, provided it did
not have to manufacture less than 6000
tons and more than 12,000 tons annually.
The other proposition was curious. It
contemplated the erection by the Govern
ment of its own plant, the Illinois Steel
Company to lease it at a nominal figure
for ninety-nine years and to furnish open
hearth ingots suitable for armor-plates.
Just before this so-called bid was an
nounced, Lieutenant Stone, who was
given the choice by Secretary Herbert of
retaining his position with the Carnegie
Steel Company or resigning his position
in the navy, and who cUose tbe first
named alternative, presented to Secretary
Long a letter from President Schwab of
the Carnegie Compauy stating the reasons
for declining to bid. He said : "With all
our facilities and experience we cannot
supply armor at that price."
The Bethlehem Company's representa
tives 6Ugcested thai if Congress would re
move the limitation of $300 per ton they
could agree on a price not greater than
that paid by any country in the world.
"What the Government will do in view
of| the setback given by the refusals to
bid has not been decided. Congress will
have to untangle the knot. Meanwhile
Secretary Long has reserved his opinion.

OF A CENTURY
CmUinucd from First Page.
and rains in the Missouri Valley flooded
that stream, which with very high water
from the Tennessee gave the main river a
volume of 1,475,000 cubic feet per second.
This combination, a quick succession of
floods, one coming before the other had
subsided, has rarely occurred â 1815, 1828,
1844, 1858, 1884 and 189Jâ and even then
the lower part of the basin had little rain
fall.
Now, however, not only have the three
great tributaries combined their floods,
any one of which suffices to put the main
stream up to the dancer line, but all tne
others, except the Red River, are con
tributing an excessive quota. From all
accounts more tban one-third of the
whole annual discharge of the Mississippi
Valley is to find its way to the gulf in a
very limited space of time.
Continuous records of the various
floods, started by Governor Snrgent of
Mississippi at Natchez in 1819, and later
at other points, were kept up until tho
Government began systematic observa
tions in 1841, and the status of all during
that time is well known, as well as the
conditions causing them. These records
show that not only does the present flood
exceed any previous one at any point
from Cairo to New Orleans, but that the
untoward conditions for its subsidence
prevail over a greater area than ever be
fore known and in many cases to a higher
degree.

Planters "nd Merchant* Appeal to the
Government for Aid.
GREENVILLE, Miss., April B.â Thou
sands of laborers in the flooded Yazoo
delta are in want. The delta embraces
ten counties and has a population of
nearly 200,000, 70 per cent of whom depend
for daily bread on rations issued by
planters and on credit from local mer
chant!). Planters and merchants secure
advances from money centers on growing
crops. To-day the planters and business
men in Washington County in meeting
decided to call for assistance from the
General Government. A dispatch was sent
to the Governor, to be sent by him to the
Secretary of War.
The Yazoo River, which ia the only out
let for the flood in this delta, is running
up stream from its mouth at "Vicksburg
to Tchula Lake in HoJmes County, a dis
tance of about eighty miles. At this place
to-day the river has become stationary,
notwithstanding numerous crevasses
above and below, and the water is still
higher than it was in 1892, when the high
water record was broken.
VICKSBURG, Miss., April 8 âAt 6 p. m.
the river gauge was 49.7 feet, a rise of
three inches in twenty-four hour?. Heels
Bayou and Deer Creek, in the upper delta,
were both putting out an immense vol
ume of water, and all the fine plantations
and towns west of the bank of Deer Creek
are inundated.
NEW ORLEANS, La., April B.â A com
mittee waited upon Captain Derby, United
Stales engineer in command of this levee
district, to-day to ask assistance in closing
the breaks in levees along the Mississippi.
Thuy asserted that unless this was done
the river would entirely destroy the Loui

DINGIEY'S TARIFF BILL.
// Is Thought That Some of the Schedules
Will Be Changed in the
Senate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April B.â While
the Senate Finance Committee expects to
complete tbe consideration of tbe tariff
bi'l by May 1, differences over the specific
schedules are likely to delay the report
until June. The woolmen are preparing
tc make a stand on lower grades of wool,
and insist on 32 per cent ad valorem.
Wool worth less than 13 cents per pound
shall be guarded by a minimum rate of 6
cents a pound specific duty.
The lead ore people are determined to
i have half a cent a pound more. And yet
I Aldrich and Allison intend to generally re
i duce rates. They want to put pine him
i ber back to $1 a thousand, as in the Me
j Kinley bill, instead of %2 as in the bill be
j fore them. They desire to scale the coal
rate from 7"> cents a ton to HO, and to re
duce the entire woolen schedule so as to
make it tally with the McKinley bill rates,
viewed in the licht oÂ» lower prices now
prevailing.
IN AN ICEPACK.
Perilous Encounter of the Steamer
Brooklyn City Off the Newfound
land Banks.
NEW YORK, N. V., April B.â Scraped
by pack-ice and with her bow stove in by
a collision with an iceberg, the steamer
Brooklyn City, from Bristol March 18. ar
rived to-day. How great the damage is
cannot be ascertained until she is un
loaded, but she bad a narrow escape, and
for two hours steamed blindly through a
sea of peril. Up to April 1 the steamer
bad an uneventful trip. Late that night,
while cautiously steering throuzh an ice
field off the Newfoundland banks, she
bumped into tbe iceberg. The concussion
was not great, but there was an ominous
grinding as tne steamer passed on, with
tne bern rolling along the starboard aide.
As near as Captain Watkins could esti
mate, tne berg was about ninety feet
square and stood about sixty feet out of
tbe water. On tbe evening cf April 2 the
ship passed three Huge icebergs, the big
gest of which was about 1600 feet long.

Senate Committee J-arort the Bill Pra

WASHINGTON, D. C, April B.âChair
man Gear of the Senate Committee on
Pacific Railroad? to-day submitted a re
port on the bill reported some weeks ago
providing for a commission, composed of
the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary
of the Interior and Attorney-General, to
settle the indeotedness of the Central and
Western Pacific railroads growing out of
the i-<sue of subsidy bonds issued in aid of
their construction. The report reviews
the various acts creating the roads and
authorizing the bonds, and the various
unsuccessful efforts in late years to enact
remedial legislation propesed by the com
mittee of this and of other Congresses.
The passagS of the commission bill is
recommended as a business-like measure
and as promising mo re advantageous re
sults to the Government tnan could be
reached by the for eclosure of the Govern
ment liens on the properties.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April B.â When
the President ana Secretary Porter return
and business at the White House is re
sumed it is likely that a new code of rules
will be posted conspicuously about the
executive mansion and uptown hotels.
All the principal hotels are now supplied
with a card on which are printed rules
governing the reception of the public at
the White House. The new rules under
contemplation will probably limit the re*
ception of the public to one nour on Sat
urday afternoons. Three public recep
tions are now held weekly, but there is a
disposition on the part of the President to
do away with two of these. Another rule
which will probably be posted will restrict
visits from Senators and Representatives
to morning hours, thereby giving the
President afternoons to attend to business
of state.

SEAL ROOKERIES
TO BE EXAMINED
Professor Jordan Interested
in Their Preser
vation.
A Special Party to Be Sent to
the Pribylov Islands in
About a Month.
It Will Seek to Determine Whether
the Seals Are Increasing or
Decreasing.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April B.âSome
thing practical is to be done in the matter
of determining whether the seal herds,
which resort to the rookeries on Pribylov
Islands are increasing or decreasing.
Professor Jordan, president of the Lela.id
Stanord Jr. University, a great authority
on seals and fish Jife, spent two or three
weeks in Washington before and after the
inauguration for the purpose of impress
ing upon the officials the necessity of
doing something, and he went home satis
tied with the result of his mission.
After a conference with the Secretary
of the Trsasury, General Duffield, super
intendent of the Coast and Geodetic Sur
vey, has organized a party to visit ttÂ»e
islands t his year. It will consist of W. W.
Duffieid Jr., G. R. Putnam and George L.
Flowers, of tho Washington office, and
Fremont Morse of San Francisco. Gen
eral Duffield hopes to have the party off
by May t but the date of derJSUure will
depend upon the sailing of the revenue
cutter Bear, whiih will carry them to the
islands from Seattle and brine them back,
leaving the islands about October 15.
It will be impossible to complete this
work in one year, or even in two or three,
and for this summer the party will con
fine itself largely to the island of St. Paul,
visiting Walrus and Otter islands, two
small bits of land lying near by. The first
purpose of the survey is to accurately lo
cate and determine the limits of the rook
eries frequented by the seals, and the re
survey of them the following year will
demonstrate whether the herds are in
creasing or decreasing.
Â£AGJLAAD \i_t.lts WATCJMSG.
BhÂ» la Sot Doing Her l>utxj in Bering
Sea. â 
WASHINGTON, D. C, April â The
President has decided to appoint a special
j commission with plenipotentiary powers
jto negotiate another agreement with
I Great Britain for the better protection of
seal life in Bering Sea. â  Negotiations with
two foreign Governments have been in i
progress lor some time. McKinley has
! already selected the representatives of the
! United State?. They are John W. Foster,
ex-Secretary o' State, and Charles S. Ham- !
lin of Massachusetts, who surrendered his j
1 position as Assistant Secretary of the j
Treasury on Tuesday. Both of these gen
tlemen are familiar with the question in
| volved. General Foster was agent for the
i United States in the. business connected
i with the Paris tribunal of. arbitration
i which 'rendered the decision against this
Government and assessed damages against
us. Ham lin has bandied ail Bering Sea
matters under the Treasury Department
for the last four years. He made a trip to
the seal islands to make himself more fa
miliar with ihe condition of affairs there.
The purpose of the Governments o;
Great Britain and the United States in ap
pointing a commission is to devise more
rigid regulations to protect seal life and to
provide for tne better enforcement of the
law than now exists. This Government
toot the initiative in the matter.
Ever since the regulations prescribed by
both countriej in accordance with the de
cision of the Paris tribunal went intoeffect
the British Government ha? not acted its
part to the satisfaction of the United
States.
The regulations prescribe that vessels
found in the close season in the forbidden
zones with arms and ammunition on board
shall be seized and sent to the nearest port
of the country concerned with a prize
crew in charge. Suspicious British ves
sels overhauled by the British patrol have
been merely warned, while the officers of
the United States vessels have endeavored
to carry out their instructions to the let
ter. Another point of objection to the
manner in which the British have acted is
that her Mejesty's patrol has never con
sisted ot more than three ships and some
times only one has been assigned to that
duty.
On the other hand this Government has
maintained a big fleet in Bering Sea every,
year. How soon the commission will
meet cannot be ascertained. Both Foster
and Hamlin are in town, but neither will
talk of the matter.

WASHINGTON', D. C, April 8.-Secre

and will distribute gratis to farmers of the
country, and particularly the Northwest,

industry in order to keep part of that s\Â»m
on these shores. The soil of the North

climate, to the cultivation of ttie sugar
beet, which yields as high as 25 per cent
of sugar.

WICHITA, Kans., April B.â The mys
tery surrounding the murder of W. H.
Orvis of Severy, Kans., the stock man
v ho was sandbagged at the Severy depot
on the night ol his intended departure
for Kansas City in August, 1895, and who
afterward died from his injuries, has
been cleared up by T. N. Webster, now an
inmate of the Hutchinson reformatory.
Orvis, who was a rich Englishman, was
found iying unconscious and badly bruised
beside the depot platform, and his pockets
had been ritied, leaving the impression
that robbery had been the sole motive
for the crime. The robbers got a roll of
bills amounting to $400, $6000 in Govern
ment boiiffo and his gold watch. Upon
the partial recovery of Orvis, he was una
ble to give any description of his assail-.
ants, and no one has ever Deen arrested,
though Greenwood County subsequently
offered a $500 reward for their arrest and
conviction. The injured man died sud
denly about two months after the sand
bagginsr.
In the meantime a letter reached him
very mysteriously stating that if he would
co to Kansas City alone and without giv
ing the detectives a hint of his purpose,
his bonds would be returned to him. He
followed the instructions and the bonds
were restored to him by a man who was
a total stranger.
The confession of Webster is that he,
together with a man named Powell,
planned the robbery and that the original
intention was to kill Orvis outright and
then place hi? body on the railroad track
where it would be mangled by the train
which Orvis intended to take. Powell
etruck the blow and put the bouy on the
track, tiut at Webster's solicitation re
moved it, and the very men who com
mitted the crime gave the alarm to avert
suspicion. According to Webster's state
ment Powell was incensed at Orvia because
Orvis had maiie statements which com
promised a woman with whom Powell was
closely related.
Poweil has been located in Arkansas by
Webster's testimony and County Attor
ney Johnson of Greenwood County, who
has the matter in charge, will cause his
arrest.
The executors of the estate of Orvis
brought suit in the United States Circuit
Court at tort Scott to recover $3000 acci
dent insurance, but the Judge ruled the
case out of courr, declaring that the evi
dence pointed conclusively to suicide.
Ihe Coroner's jury, however, had re
turned a verdict of death from injuries re
ceived at the hands of unknown assail
ants.
Webst-r's confession was obtained by
the officers upon the promise of immunity
for his part in the crime. Greenwood
County offered a reward of $500 for the
arrest and conviction of the murderers of
Orvis.
When search was made for the bonds
which Orvis was known to have recovered,
tte executors were unable to find them.
Orris was infatuated with a woman at
Tojeka and it is suspected that she got
away with the bonds.
RICH MINERAL DEPOSITS.
A Large Area in the W.chiia Mountains
That /s Just Beginning to Be
De ve loped.
WICHITA, Kans., April B.â There con
tinues to be considerable excitement
about the rich mineral deposits found in
tue Wichita Mountains, in the Comanche
and Kio".a reservations, in Indian
Territory. Mining companies are being
organized Â»t several points in Okla
homa and Indian Territor}'. They
have expert metallurgists at work and
have located quite a number of mines,
both of silver and gold. They have
located the minei according to the
United States statireÂ«, but they seem
debarred from any further entry and work
by the fact that the treaty between the
United States and these tribes â the Com
anche, Arapahoe and Kiowa â forbid any
settlement or occupation of their lands,
either as farming or mining. They are
now taking proper steps to hav3 at least
the best mineral portions of these moun
tains opened np to prospectors and loca
tions of mines.
One assay has been made by an expert
at Phoenix, Ariz., showing $47 worth of
gold to the ton, while silver ami other less
precious metals are also found in paying
quantities. Another assay showed gn]d
bearing quartz running as h gh as $9150
per ton. Tiis mine was located on the
sooth side of Mount Sheridan.
There are tine beds of asphalt formed
into Jakes and so soft that one can run a
stick down two or three feet into it. There
are several lakes of this deposit, and it
continually oozes out of the earth and
has the appearance of thick tar. Around
these asphalt lakes is a continual spring
of sail water in the dryest weather.
Expert geologists say that they are of
the opinion that these asphalt lakes or
streams have their origin in the coal re
gions ot Kansas. One thing very peculiar
about these beds, however, is that there
are mussel shell* to be found all through
them. The fact that they are there is
very apparent, but how they carnn there
is a matter of interesting conjecture.
The strata in most of thete Wichita
Mountains seem to run perpendicular,
showing that their formation was due to
some powerful volcanic action or agency
directly underneath them. Ai: kinds of
minerals can be found in quantities that
would pay Handsomely if properly worked.
Silver in its various sulphate forms can
be found; also iron, copper, slate, granite
and various other quartz formations.
Gold is found most frequently in its dust
formation, being deposited in little cells,
together with iron and silver in and about
the cranuled quartz.
Springs and streams sufficient to run
EiilJs and various mining machinery the
year round are found in the valleys be
tween these mountains, which show the
richest mineral deposits.

MILLION-DOLLAR CONFLAGRATION.
Heart ot Knoxville, Term.. in Ashesâ Two
Lives Believed to Have Been Lest.
Many Irjj.-ed.
KNOXVILLB, Term.. April B.â Two
lives are thought to have been lost and
probably a dozen people badly injured in
a tire that destroyed four blocks of build
ings here this morning in the business
part of the city.
The fire started in a grocery store and
spread to the Hotel Knox, in which were
fifty sleeping guests, next door. The fire
men set their ladders against the sides of
the hotel and rescued most of the inmates.
All are accounted for except L. E. Wil
liams of Springfield, Mass., and W. H.
Hollowav of Newport, Term. It is feared
they were burned to death.
The firemen were unable to fight the
flames to advantage because several large
grocery shops were In the burning dis
trict, and hundreds of barrels of oil stored
in their cellars were likely to explode.
By 9:30 o'clock, after the firemen had
worktd six hours, the whole Chattanooga
lire department had arrived, and an hour
later Hie fire was under control. It did
$1,000,000 worth of damage. During the
fire P. C. Dyer was overcome by excite
ment and was stricken by paralysis. He
fell to the sidewalk, fractured his skuil
and will die. John Bogle of London,
Term.. was burned seriously and will die.
Many others are injured. Eighteen build

It Manifests Itnelf in the Organimation
Of n I -rr 7<< â -.
LONDON, Exg., April B.â The British
feeling against Germany which came into
existence in this country when the present
Emperor first began to manifest his anti-
Eugli-h proclivities, and which was fanned
into a fl ime by the Emperor's recent tele
gram to President Kruger, has taken tangi
ble form in the organization of a secret
movement which is to be known as the
"British Anti-German League." The Gov
ernment bill now before Parliament pro
hibiting the importation of prison-made
eoods is. it is known, directed mainly
against Germany, while another recent
evidence of the feeling against that coun
try is the protest of British waiters against
the bringing over of Grman wuiters to a&
sist at the Queen's jubilee banquets.
The objects of the newly formed league
have not yet been defined in print, but
they are stated to be a promotion ana
cultivation of a sentiment against Ger
many and everything bearing the stamp
of that country and the boycotting of
German trade-men, of whom there are
thousands in London alone.
In a circular for private distribution
issued under the anspices of the league
it is declared that the sole mission in jife
of the German Emperor, who is half mad
and will probably Â«nd his days like Georpe
111. under restraint as a lunatic, is to
thwart England.
The circular declares that the German is
to be found iy every occupation in Eng
land, and that the country is harboring a
nest of enemies whose chief purpose in
life is to oust thÂ« native Englishman and
to spy upon him in every walk of life for
the purpose of using thJ knowledge thus
acquired to his detriment.
'1 he Germanizing of England, it is tie
dared, must be stopped, and Germany
must be regarded us the chief enemy of
the country. German influence ia stated

extent that there are over twenty mem

orisin in the supporters of the Salisbury
administration.
The court, too, is crowded with high
salaried Germans who hold places in the
army and navy above the heads of Eng
lishmen.
The circular concludes by declaring that
the German bacillus hud affected the en
tire nation. "Every patriot," it says,
"must lie up in arms against the German
iz nc of England, so ihpt we may make it
manifest to the mad Emperor and the
multitude upon whose neck he tramples
thai we anÂ» aware of his animosity, that
we recard Germany as our chief enemy,
and that we will be prepared when the
occasion arises to show by our deeds that
a nation which in' great part owes its ex
istence to our blood ana money shall be
sternly taught the reward of international
ingratitude. 1 '
It is understood that a member of the
House of Common? was recently dissuaded
from questioning the Government regard
ing the league and its legality by the per
sonal intervention of the Marquis of Salis
bury, who was fearful that if the matter
were elevated to the dignity of parlia
mentary discussion it would give cause to
the young Emperor to break loose once
more with his tongue or pen.
ENGLISH MILITARY DUBS
Why the Fi:ti Battalion of the
Scottish Rifles Was Dis
banded.
During a Drill They Appeared in
Such a Slovenly Condition It
Created a Sensation.
LONDON, Eng., April B.â There was a
sensation among the volunteers and
militia of the country over the disbanding,
by order of the Secretary of War, of the
Fifth Battalion of the Scottish Rifles, BuO
strong.
The disbanding is the outcome of a re
port made by Sir Francis Grenfell, wbo
was sent by the War Office to inspect the
battalion, the latter being given twelve
hours' notice to appear on parade.
The report in question leads more like a
piece of exaggerated American humor
than a serious official statement to the
Government.
It was shown that some of the men
appeared for drill in their slippers. Dur
ing the drill the officers and privates ad
dressed each other by their Christian
names. The swords, riflas and other ac
couterments were in an astounding con
dition of rust and general uacleanliness.
Three of the officers kept saloons, and
took turns in supplying liquor a; the
shooting ranges, and another officer was
a plumber who repaired the targets.
One colonel was shown to have sold 18,
--000 rounds of ammunition furnished by
the Government to a rifle club.
One officer, when ordered to put the
corps tbroueh battalion drill, was found
to be ignorant even of the words of com
mand. The disbanding of so large a bat
talion and under such circumstances is
without precedent in the history of the
War Department of this country.

Nicolas Quinones attacked the town of
Yauco. Two other bands appeared later
at La Quebrada de Yauco and Sabana
Grande.
Copies of newspapers from San Juan
and Ponce to March 29, brought by pas
sengers on the eteamer Senior, say that
the movement was suppressed at the star, t
Most of the insurgents surrendered. It
is admitted by ton.c newspapers, how
ever, that some forty men remained in
the field and that several Spanish col
umns had started for Torres Hills; where
the insurgents under Velez and Cubano
had taken retuge.

The Ley, an ultra-Radical newspaper in
Santiago, has disclose i certain facts with
regard to the situation in army circles
which have bad a disturbing effect upon
the public mind. The paper say* that re
cently a meeting of great significance was
held at the house of General Canto, a
division commander, at which were pres
en four other generals and two colonels.
The paper declared that the object of
the meeting was to frame a petition to
the Government for the removal of Gen

The Government papers at first denied
the truth of the alleged disclosures made
by the Ley, but it now seems to be ad

10-duj the Chileno, the Porvenir, the Ley
and other papers say that the Government
has investigatrd the matter and will

General Canto and all those who took part

HONOLULU, Hawaii, April I.â The ar
rival of the Australia, with the news of
the favorable action of Congress on the
Hawaiian treaty and the tariff on sugar,
Has brought joy to the planters and the
whole people, for all here are more or less
dependent on the price of sugar. The
good news that the treaty is likely to bo
continued in force for another Presiden

At the headquarters of the Annexation
Club there is also joy, it being announced
that the prospects of annexation at Wash
ington were never better. Your corre
spondent learns that the news was con
tained in a letter from a close friend of
President McKinley, who intimates that
Hawaiian affairs will be attended to after
the tariff bill is passed.
The Evening Bulletin of to-day an
nounces the appointment of "William A.
Kinney as Special Commissioner toWasu
ington and an interview with President
Dole confirming it. Mr. Kinney goes in
the interests of annexation and will carry
the answer of the Government to certain
queries made from Washington in the last
mail. Mr. Kinney is a brilliant young
member of the Honolulu bar, a fluent
speaker and an ardent annexationist. He
was formerly in partnership with Charles
L. Carter, the only victim of the late revo
lution.
In a published and signed statement A.
S. Humphries, one of Mrs. Carrie H. Di
mond's attorneys in the trial of Her divorce
case, refutes the statements made by her
in certain San Francisco papers that he
advised her to withdraw her appeal on
the ground that certain members of the
(supreme Court were related to Mr. Di
mond, as was also the trial Judge, A. W.
Carter. He says in part:
In justice to myself 1 wish to deny in toto
every reference to Judge Carter as to his de
cision being controlled by his relationship to
Mi. U.mouii. lam not now aware that there
is any relationship, either by affinity or con
sanguinity, and was not when the case was
being i ried or since.
My reasons lor advising my client against
an apj.eai was based upon the evidence in the
Circuit Court and upon the actions of Judge
Carter throughout tne trial. At the close I
declined 10 argue the case, but I too* occasion
to thank Judge Carter lor the fairness of his
ruungs and tic learning he displayed in trv
iug the case. There were many things brought
out in evidence, which while not clearly prov
ing the charges ot adultery, certainly influ
enced Judge Carter, and would have iuilu
enceQ any other fair-minded Judge in the same
way.
Mrs. Dimond's statement that I advised her
to compromise her case is unqualified
ly false. 1 hud heard that Mr. 1/imuud
wa* willing to give my client a sum of
money to enable ncr to go to her home in
lowa. I sent ior Mr. Kinney to inquire if the
report was correct and he referred me to J. O.
Carter, tromhiml learned that some auch
arrangement might be made, and I afterward
learned from him that the amount Mr. L>x
moua would pay was $1(XK).
I then called on Paul Neumann, senior coun
sel in the case, and reported the matter to him
ana asked his views. Personally I was opposed
to her accepting the money Jrom a hand
which she scorned and which I felt satisfied
acorned her. 1 presented my views to Mr.
Neumann and we agreed that I should advise
her against accepting the momey. I then sent
for Mrs. Idinoud and told her what
could be obtained, but cautioned her
against accepting it, as it would bar her
from making any statement to her friends. It
is the privilege of any person who loses a case
to tell their friends the trial was not fair and
that justice was not meted out; any one can
say that, whether it is the truth or not.
I told Mrs. Dtmo:.d she had better leave
here without a dollar with the verdict against
her than to accept money from the man who
had charged her with an offense, and of which
she had been convicted in the court. I went
even further than this, and ottered to advance
her B'ifficipnt money to enrry her to any point
in the L'nittd States and reiy upon her father
to reimburse me. Sue preferred the $1000
and signed a letter to that effect. Here it is:
A. 8. Humphriesâ D-eau Su: I hereby author ze
you to eff. eta settlement of all my matters upon
i lie best leruis which you can make. Very respect
fully. tAKRY HIQLKY J'lilOSD.
On March I wrote J. O. Tarter taat I would
close the matter up for #1000. the same to be
applied as per schedule lurnisned. Mr. Carter
responded tiiu next day, ucoepiing ou beliall
of Mr. Dimond the proposition I had made. 1
accepted each of tliu conditions named, but
requested (hat the draft for $450 be made on a
San Francisco bank rather tnan on Williams
Dimond & Co., for reasons which 1 felt sure he
would appreciate.
The settlement of $1000 was made and the
money paid as agreed on, Mrs. Dimond receiv
ing no more, no less. 1 regret exceedingly
that Mrs. Dimond has given out the impres
sion in San Francisco that unless a person is
related by family or religious ties they cannot
get justice In the Honolulu courts. As her
attorney I can say, and without violating any
of the confidences which exist between lawyer
and client, that the trial ot the Dimond case
before Judge Carter was as fair as li could have
been in any court in the world.

Lamb, William McKenzio and George
Rounds, constituting a party of six, have
just returned from the Yukon. They say
the stories concerning the extraoidinary
richness of the discoveries in the Cloudyke
district have not been exaggerated in the
least.
Thorp arrived there last fall and spent
the winter along the various creeks tribu
tary to the main stream. The prospects
thus far located. Thorp says, are on Bon
nanza and El Dorado creeks. The amount
oi gold contained in many of the claims,
which has been computed with a reasona
ble degree of accuracy by sinking pros
pect holes in various portions of the pay
streak and taking an average of pans of
gravel from each one, is almost incredible.
In these districts 10 cents to a pan is
considered paydirt, but Thorp solemn ly
declares v<&\. there are many claims yield
ing from $5 to $100 to the pan.
Even richer discoveries were made by
FranK Berry, owner of No. 6. at El Do
rado. A single pan has yielded $338, in
cludine a nugget worth $2SB. Berry oper
ated his claim almost all winter, paying
his laborers $1 25 an hour. He located the
pay streak for a width of 150 feet, averag
ing three feet in thickness, the full width
of the claim. Good dirt is encountered
immediately under the muck (which in
that locality is about nine feet thick) that
yields from 8 to 25 cents to the pan, but
the pay streak is not considered to have
been struck until 75-cent dirt is reached.
Fan after pan taken from the bedrock on
this claim ran from $150 to $200. It is
reported to have almost staggered the be
lief of the oldest Yukoners.
Berry's expenses have been about $150
a day all winter, but he is said to have
enough gravel lying on the dumD ready to
be washed oui to eaual a fortune of six
figures.
"I was standing near Berry's dump one
evening," said Thorp, "when Mrs. Berry
came down from the cabin to call her hus
band to supper. While waiting for him
to come up the shaft she picked up over
$t0 in coarse gold and nuggets that were
lying loose in the gravel, just as it came
from bedrock, not live minutes' time be
ing occupied in doing it."
But notwithstanding the abundance of
gold there appeared to be, at the de
parture of Tborp, grave danger that starva
tion would run some ot the miners in the
Yukon a very close race before the spring
supplies of provisions reached them.
At Cloudyke Hour is selling at $50 a
sack â $1 a pound. There is none to be
had at Forty-mile, and Circle City is with
out bacon. No game to speak of can be
found anywhere in that section. It costs
$1 a pound to take provisions from Circle
City to CloudyKe. "Beans are selling at 30
cents a pound at Cloudyke and 15 cents at
Circle City. No sugar is to be had at
Cloudyke, and any grade sells 25 cents a
pound at Forty-mile.
Meanwhile the Canadian police, as cus
tom officer?, are getting in their deadly
work in the way of collecting duties. On
the cattle tnkeii to Cloudyke, Thorp had
to pay a customs duty "of 20 per cent of
their price.

ADVENTURE NEAR UKIAH.
San Franc/sco Deputy Sher.ff Rescues
Two Young Women From a Swollen
Torrent.
URIAH, Cal., March B.â The story of
an exciting rescue by a tsan Franncisco
Deputy Sheriff of three companions, who
were threatened with drowning Jn the
rain-swollen river, came to light here to
day and has caused much comment. De
puties "Jim Degan and "Jack" Tracy of
Sheriff Whelan's force came up with two
insane patients who had been committed
to the a- yium, and alter landing tlieir
charges at the institution started out to
ace the sights during the few hours that
intervened before their train for San Fran
cisco left. Meeting two youni; ladies of
their acquaintance they decided on a drive
to Vichy Springs and procuring a team at
a liveiy-stable started on their trip.
The Russian River is still high from the
recent storms, and the ford that is gener
ally used was covered Ly a roaring tor
rent. The horses were making their way
carefully across and were up to their
flanks, when the carriage wheels suddenly
caught on some object on the bottom and
the vehicle *tuck fast. The animals were
urped on, but the only result whs the
breaking of the wliiftietroe and the de
camping of the fricluened steeds, leaving
the occupants in water that was running
so swift that it threatened to overturn Â»he
carnage. It seemÂ«d madness to attempt
to wade ashore, but there wat nothing
else to be done, and Dvgan. who is over
six feet tall and very powerful, leaped in to
the water and struggled toward shore.
Finding that the water did not carry
him down stream he returned to the car
riage, and taking one of the ladies on his
shoulders landed her safely on shore after
a hard battle. The second was also placed
on dry land, and then Degan took com
passion on his iriend. Deputy Tracy, who
is snort and stout, and made a third
journey ashore with him.
Decan was exhausted and wet to his
armpits, but he caught the horses, with
the aid of a boy who happened along, and
eventually got the carriage out and to a
place where it was safe. Â»
LOSS OF THE THETIS' MASCOT.
Seamen of the United Slates Vessel
Mourn the Death of Their Fa
mous Dog, Turpin.
SAN DIEGO, Cm... April B.â The
United States coast survey vessel Thetis,
which left this port on January 9, steamed
into the harbor at this afternoon,
after a cruise of several thousand miles
down the const and up the Gulf of Cali
fornia as far ns Guaymas- There was
mourning aboard the vessel, for the The
tis' mastiff, Turpin, had been lost on the
trip. Turpin was a faithful canine which
was born on the Thetis, and tDe seamen
looked upon him a- a comrade as well as
a dispenser of goid fortune.
"Turpin was born nboard ship one hot
day â February 17, ISS7â as the Tnetis was
crossing the equator on her way up from
rounding the Horn," said a brawny sailor
in telimg of the loss. "His mother was
down in me forecastle, where some of the
boys bad made a bed for her, wtier Turp
was born, fc-he was a water spaniel.
"From that day Turp became the prop
erty of the menâ and didn't wo take good
care of him? â for we loved the dog;
couldn't help it, he was so blamed smart.
He would c.inijb up the mast and perch
himself in the crosstrees ween we was at
sea, and he could scent a storm long
afore the barometer indicated anything,
and he knowed all the navies of the world
by heart.
"On the 20th of February last, just two
days after Turp's tenth birthday, we
dropped anchor near Fichilinquo Island,
in the Gulf of California, where there is a
United States Government coaling Bta
tion. Turp jumped overboard, swam
ashore ana wanaered off alter a rabbit.
That night he aidn't return, and the next
morning & searching party was started
alter him. The island is a rocky desert,
with no water but a few alkali pools that
no ordinary dog would drink out of, much
less Turp. Two days later we found him
dead beside one of the pools. We brought
him back and buried him by the shore
with military honors, all the officers and
men taking part, and built a monument
of stone? with the American flag in tlie
center over his grave. That's the story
andthat's why we ain't feeling to sporty
as we might."

SAU6ALITO, Cal., April B.â Fire broke
out late this afternoon on the United

just off cjausaliio. Smoke issued in clouds
from the cutter, and people stationed on
the hillsides in Sausalito, rrho noticed the
dense volumes, brought word into
town of the conflagration. On board
The Revenue-Cutter Rush While Fire Raged in the Hold.
the revenue cntter everything was done
according tn drill, and, owing to the sys
tem, the officers were able to successfully
combat the flames.
The lire started in the galley, and was
discovered by the quartermaster on guard,
who immediately reported, and the cap
tain in command gave the lire signal,
bringing the entire crew out. Men rushed
from every direction and took their
places. Some came ?n undress uniform,
Navigator Johnson bein^ one of these.
HÂ« was shaving at the time, and his feet
were innocent of shoes. Nevertheless he
obeyed the summons.
In less than one minute three large
streams were turned upon the blazing gal
ley. The paint caused the Muoke to issue
in dense volumes and gave ttie impression
that the entire vessel was 01: fire, but
after a vigorous onslaught by the crew the
flames were quenched.
One of the officers, Navieator Johnson,
was *een by a representative of The Call
this evening, lie said that the tire start
ed from one of the pipes in the galley and
would have been quite serious bad it not
been discovered immediately. As it was
but slight damage was done.
"The fire drill on the Rush," said he,
"is quite perfect, and in less than forty
seconds we had three larpe streams of
water playing on the blnze."
The Rush caught tire in Bering Sea last
year and the men and officers ha 1 quite a
tussle before the blaze was extinguished.
There are thirty-five men on the revenue
cutter una all answered the fire summons.
It took but a short time to subdue the
flames and this evening, save for the
smell of burned wood and paint, it would
not be known" that Uncle Sam's stanch
little craft had undergone such an experi
ence.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
B.â While the Banta Clara baseball team

did against Berkeley a week ago in its

WRECKAGE OFF CLAYQUOT SOUND.
Evidence of the Foundering of a Small

According to private information re
ceived here to-day from Captain George
E. Delome of the pilot schooner M. M.
Morriil, it is highly probable that during
the recsnt severe storm a wreck of which
no definite information has been received

SPIRITS LED HIM
ON TO AFFLUENCE
Secret of Charles D. Lane's
Success in Mining
Ventures.
Said by a Friend to Depend
Entirely Upon Trance
Mediums.
Takes Their At vice When Consider
ing tha Acquisition of Prospect
Propsrties.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 8.-The
luck of Charles D. Lane, the millionaire
mine-owner of San Francisco, as a pros
pector and the purchaser of prospects,
whioh have subsequently proved to be
immensely rich properties, is often com
mented upon throughout the mining
regions of the Pacific Slope. Lane has a
large acquaintance among practical
miners, who regard his judgment about
mining properties as almost infallible.
An expression heard among miners is that
"wherever Lucky Lane goes fortune surely
follows."
In view of his uniform good fortune
miners and prospectors watch his numer
ous operations with eagle eyes. Lane, it
is said, never touches a claim which does
not turn out well. Some of his most
valuable mining properties were most un
promising when he acquired them.
Many a poor prospector has laughed
over the millionaire's credulity in buying
a "prospect hole," but in each case the
man who parted with his mine has been
made to regret his hasts. In a few days
usually tbe properties purchased for a few
dollars have been found to be worth
thousands and tens of thousands.
But, what has passed for luck with Mr.
Lane for so many years is declared by a
frient to have been based on a careful and
methodical procedure, wherein the occult
has figured extensively. A miner just in
from the desert, who knows the owner of
the famous Fortuna well, says that Mr.
Lane never makes a purchase of any min
ing property without hrst consulting a
snirit medium for pointers and assurances.
When a claim is offered to Mr. Lace he
procures specimens of the ore and then
coes direct to his medium lor advice.
Seances are always held over the frag
ments of quartz or granite, and if the
medium says "buy" he does so. If she
says "nay" no amount cf persuasion or
cut rates can ever induce the millionaire
to put up money on such a claim. The
medium on whom Mr. Lane now princi
pally depends for his great good luck re
sides in Oakland.
RIGHTS OF PULPIT AMD PRESS.
Novel Points Raised in a Libel Suit
Brought by an Evangelist Against
a Newspaper.
LOS ANGELES. Cau, April B.â The
trial of the sait of Evangelist I. T. John
son of the M. E. church against the Fresno
Republican for libel, now on in the United
States Circuit Court in this city, revives
the memory of some very warm times a t
the center of the famous raisin bei t 01 the
San Joaquin Valley about -one year ago.
Johnson's declaration wi.ich cause d the
rumpus imputed a lack of chastity among
the young women of Fresno and was
made, the preacher claimed, upon infor
mation given to him by "a graduate of
Brown University."
A motion was made by the defendant's
attorneys to-day to nonsuit the reveren d
gentleman, because of admissions by his
counsel iv his opening statement to the
effect that the plaintiff aid make (he state
ment imputed io him by the newspaper.
In the arguments a nice point was
raised by F. H. Short, of counsel for the
defense â a point that has never been
passed on. In brief it was whether there
is any limit to the promulgation of a
slander from the pulpit respecting the |
private character of citizens, and when a
slander has been so promulgated, even
though it be in the form of a repetition of
the words of another, whether the press
has a right to review such a slander and
hold the promulgator responsible, whether
it originated with him or was only an
nounced by him as the reported words of
an informant.
Having made the admission referred to,
defendant's counsel claimed there could
be no libei, for the reason that the news
paper bad the right to make such com
ment as it chose in order to protect the
reputation of the girls of Fresno against
a slander in whatever form it might be
in acie public. Another point made by the
de fense was whether an individual in the
KEW lODAT.

TO AID THE UNEMPLOYED.
Salvation Army Froposes to Siart Various
Industries to Emp oy Men
and Women.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April B.â The
Salvation Army of this city has been in
consultation with its leaders in other parts
of the country for some time as to the best
method of dealing with the unemployed
problem. The army authorities now come
forward with a plan which they have laid
before a number of busiuess men and
workers in the charity field, and which is
considered leasible. It is to start various
industries, one at a time, on a f>mall scale,
to manufacture articles of common use,
where the element of labor is a large fac
tor and which will not conflict in any con
siderable degree with existing locai in
terests.
They are particularly desirous of find
ing lines of work where women can be
empioyed, and the first one to be under
taken will be the mating of rag carpet. '
The army will send out its own solicitors
to procure the rags from tbe people of the
cny, and for so worthy an obiect large
quantities can undoubtedly be obtained
without other cost than that of gathering.
At the beginning, fr m ten to twenty
women can be put at work at $3 a week
sorting and cutting the rags and weaving !
them into carpets. The outlay for the
plant will he small, and it is calculated
tbat|2oo will accomplish all that is neces
sary to start the undertatine and produce
working caniul until returns come in.
As soon as the merit of the enterprise be
comes evident it will be possible to en
large it to employ many more women,
and perhaps some men.

LOSES A MAN AT SAN DIEGO.
One of the Cruiser Philadelphia's Sailor*
Poisoned by Drinking Shellac and
Water.
SAN DIEGO, Cal.. April B.â A equad of
sailors from the flagship Philadelphia
came ashore a few nights ago, an i in an
uptown saloon one of the party bought a
drinK which the bartender called "milk
puncn."
"That's pretty eood," said one of the
boys, "can't you give us the recipe?"
Tne barkeeper good-naturedly compiled
and on Tuesday the sailors came ashore
and bought the supposed ingredients, re
turning aboard in a few hours. Some one
blundered, however, for after partaking of
the mixture all the men became ill, and
this morning one cf their number, Klinj;
Victor, died. Another, John Hellman, is
very low and two others are so sick that
ihey could not be around for a good many
days. Victor's foody was transferred to
the Monadnock this afternoon because of
the early departure of tne Philadelphia
for Honolulu and the remains will be in
terred in Mt. Hope cemetery to-morrow.
The sureeon attending pronouncea the
cause of Victor's death to be acute gas
tritis, with strong symptoms of uraenuc
poison. An autopsy upon the body late
this afternoon revealed the fact that the
man's stomach was fairly lined with
shellac, which the sailors are said to mix
with water and drink. They get the
snellac to Daint the ship and use it in
stead for the alcohol there is in it. It is,
of course, very poisonous and its use will
kill in time.

VANCOUVER, B. C, April B.âAccord
ing to Oriental advices by steamer arriv
ing to-day the Japanese schooner Minato
gawa Afaru, wh.eh arrived in Yokohama
harbor, brought news of grewsome hap
penings on the island of Guam. Toward
tbe end of December last a vessel brought
from the Philippines a cargo of rebels as
prisoners (some 400 in number), of whom
half were put on shore at Gnam, the rest
being taken on to another island.
Food was scarce, and the chief official at
Guam bnd only a few guards at his dis
posal. Emboldened by this knowledge
ana actuated also by the hope oor. r seizing a
Japanese senooner then lying in the har
bor the prisoners tried to break out of
prison. The Spaniards were warned in
time, and it is stated by the Japanese that
during three nights armed men outside
continued firing into the place of confine
ment, probably to discourage attempts at
an emeute. An average of from forty to
fifty represented each night's butchery,
the survivors escaping only by hiding be
hind tbe bodies of their companions.
When at last the massacre ceased two
thirds of the wretched rebels were dead.
A correspondent writing from Hakodate
on March 22 says: The American whal
ing bark Cnarlcs W. Morgan, Captain J.
O. Layton, arrived here yesterday, having
taken no oil since leaving San Francisco
on December 3, 1896. Captain Layton
confirms the report of tbe Japanese
schooner Minatogawa Maru regarding the
massacre of rebels at Guam. He give the
number of those killed at 180, and states
that they were shot while breaking oat of
prison.

Coionel Finigan has instituted a new
order of things in Mann's County Jail.

ment he received, but says that he will re
main in jail all of his life rau.er than pay

(be prison from a Hotel near by.
Tne colonel says that the woman who
is suing him for a divorce ,*â¢â¢ already
cost him thousands of dollars, and that
she will never get another cent so long as
he can prevent it. Thirteen years ago
they were married and ther spent most of
the time in traveling abroad. Mrs. Fin
lean's suit for divorce was originally
commenced in San Francisco, but was
transferred to Marin County. The depo
sition on fiie in the County Clerk's office

facts. One of the colonel's cruel acts was
bis refusal to accompany Mrs. Fiuigan
to a barber-shop to have her arm shaved.
The contempt proceedings will have to
be settled before the divorce case can be
tried. Colonel Finigan does not bear any
ill feeling toward Judge Angelotti, who

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 9, 1897.
BURGLARS FIRE
UPON A WOMAN
Shrieks for Mercy Wasted
On Ears Calloused by
Crime.
Visitors to Santa Monica At
tacked in Their Room by
Murderous Thugs.
Engineer Pace of Los Angeles Is
Seriously Wounded, but His Wife
Escapes Unscathed
SANTA MONICA, Cal., April B.â Two
murderous ruffians entered the residence
of William Pace and wife of Los Anpeles
in this city, and attempted to murder its
two occupants. That they were nnsitccess
ful was due only to poor marksmanship,
caused by the absence of a light in the
room. Face was wonnded in the leg, and
several bullets from one of the intruders'
revolver penetrated the walls of the room
and the mattrasses of the bed on which
Mr*. Pace lav. x
Pace is a fireman on the Southern Paci
fic Railway. He and bis wife came to
Santa Monica to visit Mrs. Pace's father,
Henry W. King, ex-Chief of Police of Los
Anteles. They were given rooms in a
cottaee near King's residence. Mrs. Pace
awakened her husband at about 2 o'clock
this morning, telling him that some one
was in the room. Pace rose and struck a
match. As the blaze was flaring up some
one shouted a demand for bis money, en
forcing it with a bullet from a revolver.
The ball penetrated his leg near the knee.
Tiie match having gone out the room
was left in darkness, but from the noise
and muttered conversation Pace and his
wife became aware that the intruders
were two in number. The Angeleno told
the ruffians to take his money and bis
clothes, and one of them 'rifled h\-> pock
ets, obtaining about $10 in cash.
Meanwhile Mrs. Pace, who had been
screaming for help, began to plead with
the intruders for her life.
"You have killed my husband; do not
shoot me!" she cried.
"I'll Kill both of you," was the reply from
one of tbe ruffians, and he commenced fir
ing at the bed on which the woman lay
shrieking for mercy. Owing to the dark
ness ttie robber could not take aim, but
had to fire at random, and it so happened
that none of his buliets took effect upon
his intended victim. While the fellow
was shooting at Mrs. Pace his companion
gathered up a few articles of value in the
room and they then made their escape.
Mrs. Pace burried over to the bouse of
a neighbor end excitedly related her ex
perience. City Marshal Dexter was sum
moned and made a care.ul examination
ot the prembes, while physicians dressed
the painlul wound from wbich Pace was
Buffering.
Marshal Dexter found tracks made by
heavy-nailed boots leading away from the
window by which the robbers had entered
the cottage. Later he caused the arrest of
two men near the Arcadia Hotel who an
swered to the description given by Pace.
They were traveling tinkers and cave as
their names Phillip Btraube and Georgs
Baunders. When the Marshal approached
the pair be asked them if they had taken
out a license for peddling. One of them
at once replied in an insolent manner:
"Why don't you say tbat you want us
for that shooting and be done with it."
The men claimed to have walked from
San Francisco. The shoes they wore ex
actly fitted the tracks leading from the
Kinc cottage. They were this afternoon
held for examination, and in default of
$1000 ball were committed to the County
Jail.

who is under sentence of death for the

CHIEF JUSTICE JUDD.
He Tells of His decision Against the
Japanese â Immigration Lairs the
Same as Here.
Among the arrivals by the Monowai
last evening was Chief Justice A. P. Judd
of Hawaii, and Mrs. Judd, who are at the
Occidental. They will, so the Chief Jus
tice says, go to Los Angeles for a few days'
stay, and will then go to New Haven,
Conn., where the Chief Justice will attend
the annual meeting of Yale College
alumnae and witness the graduation of
his two sons. It is seventeen years since
he has been East.
He mentioned bis decision against the
landing of 700 Japanese recently in Ha
waii, and said the statute was exactly the
same as thai of the United States, where
the decision bad been made.
"There are six emigration agencies in
Japan," he said, "and they all make
money off the Japanese that are sent.
We had 1501 Japanese once in a week.
The census ot November, 1896. showed we
then had 24,000 Japanese and 2600 Chinese,
while our population was very much less.
At the came time there were 31,000
natives, besides 8000 of mixed native
blood; 2259 British. 1452 German and
15,000 Portuguese. We feared if the
Japnnese were allowed to come they
would soon outnumber us, and then they
would Â«oon w. nt to express themselve*
politically. Our immigration laws being
the same as in the United States, we
stopped them.
"I don't know what the Japanese
authorities may conclude. The Consul
will not say whether be has asked for a
war vessel or not."

Hn. Saroni'Â« Will.
Judge Coffey has decided that the will
of Mrs. Marianne Saroni is Invalid.
On January 20 last Mine. Saroni died in
Alameda, leaving an estate valued at 530,
--000. The property she bequeathed by a
holographic will to a number of favored
relatives. At the bottom of the document
following the signature were the words:
"Alanieda, Novor 6. 95. 1832 Pacific Ave
nue A.araeiin."
As soon as the will *vas filed a son of
the decedent wno thourhi he had not
been properly treated instituted a contest
and raised the objection that the date of
the will was insufficient on the ground
that the figures 95 do not express the year
1895.
Judge Coffey drew attention to the re
quirement of the code that a holographic
will must bp written, signed and dated by
the testator, and held that tho figure* "95"
did not indicate the year 1895. The prop
erty will be distributed among the heirs
at-law as if no will bad been made by the
decedent
LAWYER MORGAN'S
SUPERB NERVE
Appeared Among His
Former Wife's Rela
tives Near Ukiah.
He Claimed to Have Done so to
Avoid Persecution ac
Her Hands.
Another Tale of His Dark Doings gt
Kings bnry Brought to the Light
of Day.
"Morgan's tears" has become a stereo
typed phrase when speaking or the traits
of the attorney who fled this City to avoid
prosecution at the hands of Capitalist
Alsip for black ma iling, but late discover
ies place Morgan's nerve on a high plane,
A letter was received from Mendocino
County yesterday by the missing attor
ney's former wife from relatives, who
show that his audacity is unequaled.
According to the epistle in question,
Morgan app a red at Orr's Hot Springs,
fourteen miles from Ufciab, about two
weeks ago, and claimed that he had come
to them to avoid Mrs. Morgan and her
persecutions. Taken in conjunction with
the fact that his former wife had not seen
ii:m in three months, and had never in
troduced him to her relatives because she
had no confidence in his character, this
action deserved a leather medal,
Morgan disappeared from the springs,
where be was known to other than rela
tives under the name of MeNamara, sev
eral days ago. Ue must have returned di
rectly to this City, as he was seen here
only a few days ago by two credible wit
nesses, an account of which meeting was
published exclusively in I he Call.
Another tale has come to light regard
ing Morgan's Kingsbury career, which, if
true, and it is given by a person of probity
and good reputation, will hardly tend
to increase the esteem in whica he is at
present held by the public.
The story is to the effect that a certain
Fresno capitalist had a daughter, who fell
in love with a young civil engineer of
favorable reputation. Her father wished
her to marry the son of a local banker,
but she chose rather to marry the man of
her choice.
The father was incensed at this action
and upon going to Kingsbury was In
formed by .Morten, it is alleged, that tne
son-in-law had not been divorced from a
former wife.
The youne husband procured a situation
as assistant engineer in one of the steam
ers plying Letween this port and Hono
lulu, and the rather in order to protect is
daughter had influence brought to bear to
induce her to sign an application for
divorce. This all occurrM in the fall of
1885 and in the spring of 1886 the divorce
was granted.
Afterward the father found that he was
in error and that his former son-in-law
had been properly divorced from his first
wife, who was then dead. He made
proper restitution by permitting his
i laughter to remarry the man she loved
and they are now Jiving happily in
Fresno.
MRS. GAGAN'S TESTIMONY
Declined at First to Take The
Stand on the Advice of
an Attorney.
The Wife of a Former Foreman of a
Grand Jury Was Up on Order
of Examination.
Justice of the Peace Groezicger was com*
pelied yesterday to mention the fact to
Mrs. William Gagan, wife of the dmegist
nnd former foreman of a Grand Jury, that
refusing to obey the orders of the court
constitutes contempt and that people are
sometimes sent'to jail for that offense, in
order to get her to take the witness-stand.
Mrs. Gagan was up on order of exam
ination in the case of William Schaefer vs.
John J. O'Brien in order to ascertain
whether or not she is indebted to the de
fendant.
Mrs. Gagan built an elegant residence
for herself and her husband and some of
the workmen were not paid by the con
tractor. Among them was Schaefer, who
obtained judgment for $175 and coats for
painting work unpaid for. There seemed
to be nothing on which to fasten an exe
cution, so Mrs. Ga^an, as the capitalist of
the firm, was served with an order of ex
amination for the purpose mentioned.
At the time the examination was first
set for hearing the druggist's wife did not
appear and the matter was continued.
Before it came up the second time an in
junction was pued out in the Superior
Court ordering the plaintiff to proceed no
further in the matter of the examinat ion.
Mrs. Gazan appenred, however, with
her husband, a former newspaper re
porter, and when the plaintiff's attorney
insisted on questioning her. Justice
Groezinger ordered the examination to
proceed, the injunction having no appli
cation to him. It was tnen that Mrs.
Gagan's husband grew angry.
On the advice of her attorney, Mrs.
Gagan at first declined to take the stand,
but later when the law of contempt waa
quoted to her by the Justice she consented
to testily. Her husband was angry, as be
did not like people to know the sources
of the Ga-an income.
On the stand Mrs. Gagan stated that the
money with which their house was built
was ail hers and that she had signed cer
tain documents relating to the transac
tions apoertaining to the work, but did
not know what they were, tint did not
know whether the owed the contractors
anythinS or not, but she did know that
the edifice had cost something like $13,000.
She was finally released from the ordeal,
but not before the plaintiff's attorney had
announced that he would require her to
appear again to answer other questions.
Mr. Gagan stated that his wife was per
fectly willing to pay the bills that had
been contracted in the building of their
home, but would rather know who was
entitled to toe money before disburs
ing it.

â¦ THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
i'areweii. Chief Crowley; all bail, Chief
Lees.
We have lost a good Chief of Police, but
there is another.
It is springtime, says the almanac It
is summer, says the weather bureau.
The experience of the boulevard workers
is that even a barbecue isn't always what
ii is cooked up to be.
ThÂ« wool industry has already felt the
effect of the corring protpctive tariff and
prices have begun to climb.
The touievard fund claims attention
once more. Now is the time to give it a
lift and keep the work moving.
There seems to be no leader in Europe
either for war or for peace and everything
is drifting to a general cataclysm.
It seems about as difficult to blockade
the war movement in Europe as it is to re
strain the Mississippi in this country.
This is the kind of weather which gives
a man the tired feeling at his business, but
a superabundant energy for a holiday.
The Qaeen's jubilee will be a wasteful
holiday for the American tourist and a
harvest time for the London shopkeeper.
It will be noticed that McKinley hasn't
overworked himself nnd been forced to go
fishing for a rest. He isn't that kind of a
statesman.
The Mississippi floods tnls year are said
to be the largest in the history of the river.
They have a faculty of growing up with
the country.
The workingmen in the East who have
beeun striking for higher wages are de
cidedly premature. The Dingley tariff is
not in operation yet
The Dingley bill will have a hard strug
gle in the Senate, but there is no danger
that it will corue out so tattered and shorn
as the Wilson bill did.
Now that the lowa has been tested for
Breed and proven good it wouldn't be a
bad idea to send her to Cuban waters and
try her fighting powers.
Carnival talk is now heard all over the
State from Los Angeles to Lateport. It
is going to be a festal seaÂ«onfor California
and a trood time for all who have a frolic
some spirit.
Jerry Simpson's attack on Speaker Reed
emphasizes the importance of the Reed
rules to the House. Just imagine what
the proceedings would be like if Jerry
were permitted to have his own way.
Protection to American ships should be
provided for at the same time as protec
tion to other industries. With the in
crease of our products there should bean
increase of commercial power to send
them all over the world.
It is said tbe loss entailed by the Missis-
Bippi floods this year would have more
than repaid the cost of works which would
permanently prevent them, but the trou
ble is nobody seems to know how such
works should be constructed, even if the
Nation were willing to pay for them.
Not a single alliance arranged by the
diplomatists of Europe has withstood the
strain put upon it by the Cretan crisis.
Public opinion has overcome secret in
trigue and the press is now doing more to
shape the course of the nations than all
the diplomatists and statesmen put to
gether.
The Board of Health hai adopted a good
Jine of work in enforcing the pure-food
law. and if it hews to the line it will have
public support, no matter where the
chips may fall. California produces an
abundance of good foods of all kinds, and
there is no reason why adulterated arti
cles should be sold here.
In attacking the Salisbury Ministry and
supporting the cau'e of Greece, the Lon
don Chronicle declares: "England's higb
est and holiest concern is to be the helper
of free nationalities." It is evident from
this that enthusiasm can attain to uncon
scious humor just as easily as the sub
lime can reach the ridiculous.
The city elections in the East this year
constitute a decided case of mixed pickles.
Chicago went Democratic, bnt St. Louis
went Republican. Several towns in Ohio
elected Democrats, but in Kansas the Re
publicans had the best of it. It looks as
if the people everywhere wanted a change
and had started a variety show.
St. Helena has organized a Board of
Trade and will work fdr the establish
ment of a sugar refinery, a creamery, a
cannery and a fruit-dryer. These aims
are not beyond the attainment of the com
munity, and if the people generally give
proper support to the leaders in the enter
prises all of them may be accomplished
in a comparatively short time.
The fact that a steamship is to be fitted
with refrigerators to carry ice from Cali
fornia to Alaska is one of the cariosities
of commerce. It is not stranger, however,
tban many other commercial ventures.
In fact, "carrying coals to Newcastle" is
now a commonplace of trade, and there is
scarcely a department of commerce that
does not show some apparent paradox of
the kind.
WATCH THE TARIFF.
The Senate Committee on Finance is busily engaged in revising the tariff bill as
it came from the House. What alterations will be made cannot^e foreseen. Parties
are closely drawn in the Senate, and tne chances for a reduction of duties from the
House rates are hardly less than those for an increase. The situation is at any rate
one which requires watchfulness on the part of the members of every industry whose
interests are involved in the bill.
Incessant vigilance is particularly necessary to Californians. Reports from Wash
ington show that New York importers are making earnest efforts to obtain a reduction
on the duties imposed upon fruit, nuts, olive oil and other products which are pro
duced no where in the Union except in California. A strong attempt will be made
also to break down the duty fixed on woo!. In fact, a fight for free raw material and
food products will be waged all along the line, and in the present evenly divided con
dition of the Senate these assaults constitute a danger we cannot afford to ignore or
despise.
Well-informed correspondents say that the pressure that is being brought to bear
upon the committee is tremendous. That pressure we must counteract so far as it is
antagonistic to California industries and interests. The Senate can make a tariff bill
without our aid, of course ; but if it does so it will ruake one against us. If we are not
vigorous in maintaining our cause ourseives we cannot expect others to be so. The
California influence should be felt at Washington not less than the New York inÂ»
fluence, for otherwise the industry of the California producer may be sscrificed to the
greed of the New York importer.
It must be remembered that the Senat9 is so divided at this time that it may be
impossible to enact a tariff which will not be to a large extent a compromise bill.
The party of protection as a National syÂ«tem does not control the Senate. The Ding
ley bill, so wisely drawn in the Home, may be badly distorted before the Senators
finish with it. This is the danger which confronts us. It is sufficiently serious to
call for earnest attention on the part of the people of California. We cannot afford to
have the Dingley duties reduced on wool, fruit, raisins, lumber or any other product
of the State. This, therefore, is the time for incessant vigilance on our part. Watch
the tariff.
EX-OHIEF CROWLEY.
The retirement of Patrick Crowley from
the position of Chief of Police, which he
has so long and so worthily filled, affords
to the people of San Francisco a good op
portunity for makins known to him the
popular esteem for his c aracter and the
public appreciation of the manner in
which he has performed the arduous,
dangerous and complex duties of the
office.
It is right and fitting that the press
should give some expression to public
sentiment in this regard, and The Call
gladly and cheerfully does so. J?"or many
years Chief Crowley has been the most
noted Chief of Police in the United States.
He has enjoyed a N&tional fame rather
than a local reputation. Among oiticers
of the law throughout all parts of the
United States bis work has been known
and the esteem in which he has been held
has been high. No other city in the
Union has had an official in a similar
capacity who has served it so well or
whose general repute has been so wide
spread, and in whose energy, honesty
and sagacity there has been so much pub
lic coniidence.
The duties of a Chief of Police are of a
nature that require the highest personal
characteristics in the man who is to per
form ihem with success and honor. A
Chief of Police must be a clean man per
sonally, free from all evil association. He
must be a man of marked sagacity, able
to see his way cUarly to the solution of
the most difficult problems of law and
crime so that the evildoers may be sup
pressed and the innocent saved from
wrong. He must oe a mau of couraee,
whom no dangers can daunt, and of hon
esty which no bribes can subvert. He
must have, moreover, that discretion in
the management of delicate matters which
will enable people to entrust him with con
fidential secrets without fear that they
will bo disclosed. All of these character
istics Chief Crowley possessed, and along
with them he had an energy which en
abled him to put them into gooi effect in
every emergency that arose.
After more than twenty- four years of
service, in which he has faithfully per
formed every duty entrusted to him, the
Chief now goes into retirement with a
record on which there is no snot or stain
or mark that mars. It is a clear, clean,
honest record, one of which the Chief may
be proud and iv which his children and
his children's children may rightly re
joice.
The people of San Francisco may also
take a just pride in having bad so excel
lent an officer in this difficult position
and in having supported him in it for so
long a time. His career is as creditable
to the community that upheld him as it
is to himself. Now in his old age, as he
goes into retirement to enjoy the rest and
pension he has so well deserved, he will
continue to be honored as he has been in
the past. He will long serve the people
of San Francisco as a model by which all
future chiefs of police may mold their
standard of action, and it will be ac
counted praise for even the best of them
to be said that he is a worthy successor of
Patrick Crowley.
THE MISSISSIPPI FLOODS.
The act of Congress appropriating $200,
--000 for tbe relief of the sufferers by the
Mississippi floods will be well received by
the country. Congress in fact could have
hardly done otherwise. Since we have
been liberal in giving aid to India and
o:her foreign countries we could not hesi
tate in extending help to our own cuun
trymen when they need it.
The fund thru bestowed by the Govern
ment will be but a small part of the help
which will be given to the stricken peo
ple. Private charity will far exceed it in
generosity and in amount, and it Is certain
that so far as charity can repair the evil
wrought by the flood it will be done.
The serious feature of the situation is
that the relief granted by the Government
or given by private generosity will be only
a temporary expedient. It will not in
any way prevent the occurrence of simi
lar disasters in the future. In fact the
Mississippi problem is rapidly becom
ing chronic. Floods to a greater or less
extent occur every year, and, moreover,
they increase in the amount of damage
and disaster which they bring to the peo
ple who live along the banks of the great
river. Thus the work of relief done this
year will probably have to be repeated
next year, and so on until at last appro
priations for the Mississippi flood suffer
ers may become a permanent charge upon
the Government
It is evident that the attempts made to
restrain the river by levees are worse than
futile. They aggravate the evil instead of
applying a remedy for it. The higher the
levees are built, the higher is raised the
bed of the river. The more narrow the
bounds of the stream are made the more
terrible are the floods that overflow them.
All the waters which drain into that im
mense basfn whicn lies between the
Rocky and the Allegbauy mountains must
be carried off by the single great stream,
and it is a physical Impossibility to dam
up these waters on their way to the sea.
The problem is one of the most difficult
which confronts American engineering.
It seems that the only solution must bo
one which will widen the mouths of the
Mississippi so as to allow a freer flow of
water to the sea, or else a system of irriga
tion which would enable it to overflow
the whole of the lowlands of Arkansas,
Louisiana and Mississippi, as the Nile
overflows Egypt. To each of these plans
there are objections, but they are not ao
serious as those which can be urged
against the ievee system. While the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 9, 1897.
levees stand there will be overflows of in
creasing magnitude, whereas by the adop
tion of either of the other plan*, such
evils as result would be of a fixed nature,
easily calculated beforehand, and would
not entail the dangers which rosult from
a continual rise in the bed of the river and
a continual increase in the extent of its
recurring floods.
THE REED BULES.
The attack of Jerry Simpson upon the
rules under which the House of Repre
sentatives does business is not wholly to
be regretted. As Speaker Reed himself
said, it is juat as well to have the subject
brought up for consideration in order that
the people may understand it and if any
thing wrong be discovered the remedy
applied promptly by Congress.
Mr. Simpson began his attack by read
ing an article from a Washington news
paper and an extract from an article in
the current number of the Forum by Sen
ator Hoar to which we called attention a
few days ago. These articles, according
to Mr. Simpson, afforded him authority
for declaring tnat the present rules of the
House are subversive of the independence
of the members and deprive them of the
power oi riphily representing their con
stituents. Using them as texts he deliv
ered a harangue in which he alternately
denounced the Speaker as a czar and tne
House as a body of cringing slaves.
The article by Senator Hoar affords Mr.
Simpson no authority for his assertion,
although some passages in it could be
selected which teem to do so. The gen
eral tenor of the article is that it would be
impossible for the House to transact busi
ness at all without the new rules which
have been adopted, and which are so vig
orously enforced by Speaker Reed. Sena
tor Hoar points out that obstruction in
the Senate is as nothing when compared
to the obstruction practiced iv the House
whenever it is permitted.
Under the former rulss of the House it
was possible for one or two men by filibus
tering to render it impossible for a ma
jority to carry out any legislation what
ever. What Senator Hoar said about the
new rules, therefore, was not intended by
him and would not be construed by any
intelligent readeras a condemnation either
of the Speaker or of the majority in the
House. Hts whoie object was to show
that the House is not a better legislative
body than the Senate, and that current
criticisms on Senatorial proceedings which
account them as inferior to tne method of
procedure in the House are unjust, un
fair and not supported by facts.
The reply of Mr. Reed to the attack of
the member from Kansas was exactly
what it should have been. Clearly and
coolly the Speaker called attention to the
fact that be is simply the agent of the
House, entrusted with the duty of execut
ing tha rules which the House itself has
adopted. He has no power to exercise
except that which has been given him by
the majority. That power, he has reason
to believe, is not seriously objected to by
any considerable number, even among the
members of the opposition.
Leaders of the House of all parties
recognize the necessity of the new rules
for the transaction of business. This was
shown by the mariner with which Mr.
Simpson's attack was received. It found
no support Jrom any man of weight and
influence on either side of the House,
while on the other hand the delense of
tlje Speaker was greeted with general ap
plause. The sentiment of the country is
the same as that of Congress. The people
desire that public business shall be
promptly transacted, and by enforcing the
rules which enable the House of Repre
sentatives to fulfil] this desire Mr. Reed
lias made himself the most popular
Speaker since the days of James G. Blame.

OLDEST WEST FOJNI GRADUATE.
A correspondent of the Washington Star cor
rects the statement that General Ruggles is
the oldest living graduate of West Point. The
honor, he says, belongs to Brevet Major-Gen
eral George S. Greene (flrst lieutenant, U. S. A.,
retired), who entered the academy on June 24,
1819, was graduated In 1823, nine years be
iore General Kuggles, and served with gal
lautry in the volunteers during the Civil War.
He is now iv his ninety-sixth year, and is ntlll
able to attend banquets, reunions, etc. He is
the father of Colonel Francis V. Greene of this
city.

and that he will follow the precedent set by
his great-grandfather, John Jacob Astor, iv
transmitting hi* fortune to his eldest son.
Should he become a billionaire his income at 6

ORIGIN OF IHE WORD TARIFF
Harper's Round Table.
Every day when we own our morning news*
paper and read the political discussions In Its
columns, we are sure to come; across ionic
thing about the tariff. Every one knows the
meaning of the word tariff, but It is not gen
erally known where it originated. It is of
Moorish origin, and descended to us from the
time when the Moors occupied a goodly part
ol Spain. In those days they built a fort to
u * rd ,t Ue ? trait ol Gibraltar, Â«nd they called
it lama, it was the custom ol these people
to levy duties according to a fixed scale, which
they adopted and cnanged from time to time,
even as much as we do our own tariff laws, on
the merchandise of all vessels passing in and
out of the Mediterranenan. They claimed the
right by virtue of strength^ and for years
netted a rich income.
CABINET MEMBERS AS SINGERS.
Secretary Lone is reputed to be the musical
member of the Cabinet. He sings bHss in the
choir of the Unitarian church at Hingham
and belongs to a musical society in Boston
which gives oratorios, cantatas and other seri
ous music. It is claimed that the Secretary
can carry the bass to an anthem, writes W. E.
Curtis, as well as any singer in all the six
States of New England, ana that he used to
sing in church when he was yountr.
Secretary Alger is a good deal of a hand at a
war song, and will be a great addition to Sen
ator Halwey's choir at Loyal Legion banquets,
but he does not pretend to have any technical
knowledge of religious music.
Mr. Sherman does not know one tnne from
another. During the lasi campaign, while he
was stumping in Ohio, the band played "I'm
Looking for the Bully of the Town" to open
his meeting. As soon as it finished that splen
did air Mr. Sherman arose and declared that
nothing so inspired a citizen with patriotism
for the performance of his duties to his coun
try as tne majestic strains of our grand old
National hymn, '-The Star-spangled Banner,"
and he thanked the band for giving him the
text for his speech. Everybody laughed, of
course, and Mr. Sherman said afterward that
it was the most irreverent audience he has
ever addressed.

STEALING COFFIN BOARDS FROM INDIAN GRAVES.
That is what led to the famous Indian outbreak on the Rogue River, Oregon, forty years
ago. The white settlers ravaged the graves of the Indians' dead for the boards of which the
coffins were built. The Indians, whose relatives were thus horribly insulted after death, finally
uprose and precipitated a massacre. Lieutenant George W. Miller, an active participant in
that remarkable affair, now resides at Belvedere, where a Call writer interviewed him this
week. His graphic narrative, fully il.ustrated, will appear in next Sunday's Call.
The advent ol Easter week will see the advent of the Easter Girl, decked out in the most
wonderful of fine leathers. An Easter girl has written all about her lovely type and what she
has been doing in the way 01 preparing for Easter, and on one of the pages of next Suxday'B
â¢ Call she will bloom in regal splendor.
If you're a man, perhaps you marvel at the awful cost of Easter bonnets. The Call sent a
man out shopping among the milliners' stores this week, and his experiences were rich. Cal
ver went along and took snapshots of him while in the first shock of surprise at what he
learned, and while in the act of retreating from the milliner's austere glance as she demanded
to know why he didn't send his wife along.

Press, is one of the new converts to the belief
that California is the coming country. Editor
Smith came from Chicago about five months
ago and bought the little Santa Cruz daily,

ami enraptured with the world.
"I have been in many parts of the world
lately." said Mr. Smith, as he smoked a Havana
at the Grand Hotel, yesterday, "but I had not
believed there was such a paradise on this
continent as Santa Cruz, l'ou couldn't get me
back to Chicago, with its jam and noise of
human beings and its erratic climate. The
dust and smoke, blizzards, winds and sun
strokes of the East are enough to drivo one
mad.

expectoration ordinance, was one of the
best-known men in town.
The great and sudden spread of his
fame which has resulted from his arrest
be is meeting with that bland pood
nature that characterizes him. Naturally
enough he encounters it everywhere, and
while it be ins to grow tedious, still he
makes no objection.
"I don't know that I'd give $2 to have
avoided it." he said yesterday. "No, 1
have no kict coming. Somebody had to
be the first man arrested, if they were go
ing to do any arresting, and it might just
as well have been me as somebody else,
mightn't it?"
"But it will cost you more than $2 if the
precedent is followed that lias been es
tablished in such cases â a line of $2 50."
"Well, I don't know whether it will or
not," said Bradbury, allowing the twinKie
in bis eye unusual license. The trial has
not come on as yet.
"You are going to make a fight on it,
then?"
''Certainly. lam opposed on principle
to pleading guilty to anything. Mind
you, I say there is no fault to find witti
anybody, if I may except the bad printing
of the notice in tne car It is a very little
card and over the small type is printed a
red cross that nearly covers it. It is diffi
cult to read under tne best conditions, but
at night almost impossible. It was only a
day or two after the passage of the ordi
nance, and I did not know of us existence.
"But there is a question of law as to the
right of the Board of Supervisors to pass
such a regulation that shall be effective in
a streetcar. The Market-street Railway
Company is a corporation conducting
business in the City. For the sum of 5
cents it guarantees to carry me or you
from one point to another on its lines.
When I get aboard the car and pay my
fare they are responsible for carrying me
saiely to my destination, and that is all
there is to it â they take charge of me for
the time being. If the company itself
passes a regulation requiring its passen
gers to do ttius and t.o wbile in transit
then it becomes a condition to Which the
passengers must sub-cribe in addition to
the payment of fare as a consideration
for being carried on the company's cars.
Notice of such a regulation would hare to
be posted in a conspicuous place and not
obscured by any printing over it to be
effective. The question in as to wnether
any regulation passed by the Board of
Supervisors could be made effective in the
streetcars.
"Now, mind you, I am not objecting to
the ordinance if it can be enforced. lam
only going to test its limitations through
a constitutional objection to pleading
guilty. A grocer down in the next block
was arrested a short time ago under the
pure-food regulations for Belling a box of
honey, thai, under the analysis, was dis

at all deleterious to health and necessary

its form. He got me to go on his bonds;
got a poor lawyer; the prosecution seeing
they bad no case got him to plead guilty
under a promise that he would not be
fined. He did so, but baa been regretting
it ever since.

definition of 'expectoration' as made uv
Webster. Ido not chew tobacco, smoke

THEY ALL HAD A
NARROW ESCAPE
Three Hundred Guests in
the St. Nicholas
Hotel.
It Was Nitro- Glycerine That
Blew Up the Carroll
Drugstore.
A Partly Filled C n of Beuz ne Next
to a Lighted Gas J.t Com
plot A the Wreck.
A partly filled can of benzine and half
an ounce of nitro-glycerine make a dan
gerous set of neighbors with a lighted gas
jet as a connecting lint.
Early yesterday morning, at exactly
2:34 o'clock, these two deadly engines of
der-truction, by the merest accident, failed
to kill 300 jjue-ts in the St. Nicholas Ho
tel, and by their relative forces, one de
stroying the oiher, and the assistance of a
chern oil engine property to the value of
hundreds of thousands ot dollars was
saved.
The Call published exclusively in yes
terday'B issue an account of the blowine

gore of Hayes and Market streets. The
lateness of the hour prevented any more
than a general account of the affair being
given, the sujr^estive details having to be
held over for investigation until yesterday
afternoon and for publication this morn
ing.
Marshal To we, who took charge of the
store immediately after the fire was ex
tinguished, interviewed Night Clerk Mc-
Donald yesterday. The latter was too be
wildered to Rive any coherent account of
his doings Up to the time he quit work
and shut up the store after 1 o'clock in
the morning.
"As the young man calmed down," said
Towe, "he first recollected that be had
left the gas burning behind the screen j
where the prescriptions are filled. Subse
quently he denied this, but eventually
admitted that as be had done so before,
he might have done it again.
"When I examined the premises, I
found the gas cock half turned on, but
tie gas which no doubt was the prime
cause of the trouble was not burning, no
doubt having been put out by the explo
sion. . . .* : ' *
"McDonald * says that 'he had a five-,
gallon tin of benzine on the prescription
table next to the gas stove fed by the jet,
but that there was only a quart of benzine
in it. That, in itself, was a dangerous
thing. A quart of benzine in a five-gallon
tin gives the space of nineteen quarts for
gas. A full can of benzine would have
been less dangerous. * .
, "But worse than all, within two feet of
the benzine can and the gas stove stood a
bali-ounce vial of nitre-glycerine, used
sometimes by druggists in remedies for the
cure of Brights disease of the Kidneys. .
"There was enough nitroglycerine there
to blow up the entire block. Fortunately
the benzine' explosion; blew out all- the
wind panes hi the store and when the
fire and excessive heat exploded the nitro
glycerine there was but little resistance
and the force of the explosion only
wrecked the shelving and other things
spared from the first explosion. Had the
nitro-glycerine been confined it would
have carried away walls, pillars, hotel and
a great deal of the neighborhood.
"The explosion of the nitro-elycerine
bad torce enough to temporarily ckecK the
fire caused by the benzine, ana the prompt
arrival of the chemical engine saved the
entire structure from destruction by the
flames.
- "Nieht Clerk McDonald failed to report
to me about the nitro-elycerine beinÃ in
the store, and I have not seen him since I
sent him to Hay wards to get George Car
roll, the proprietor or the drugstore, who
is a cripple and lives in the country most
of the time.
"I learned of the presence of the ex
plosive from George Murphy, a boy who
works in the store daily, ana whose atten
tion was called to it that he might be care
ful not to go near it.
"Right bact of the prescription screen a
dozen shelves towered high and were
tilled with essential oils, chloroform and
ether. When these encountered the
flames there were a number of smaller ex
plosions and an increase of fire.
"I am not prepared to say that there
was anything more than criminal negli
gence in this affair. Future investigation
may show otherwise.
â  "I have iound that Carroll transferred
all the property over to his wife about
three years ago, and not until last month
did they deem it advisable to insure the
place for any sum. At this time they
took out policies in four companies for an
aggregate of $7000. Maybe they have
more.
"Another thine I find is that they are
behind about $1500 la their rent to B. and
J. 8. Doe at the rate of $300 per month.
The Joss will not exceed $5500."
GEART-STSEET BUEGLAKIES.
Several Houses >eÂ»r Octavia Street
Have Been Knterert.
1 he police have been for some days look
ing for two men who have terrorized the
residents on Geary street near Octavia by
entering their houses.
Abont a week ago they entered the
house of Morris Raphael, jeweler, during
the absence of the family, turned on the
gas and departed with a few articles of
jewelry. The residence of Samuel
Oitroski, 1214 Geary, was entered the
same night and several articles of jewelry
were stolen. The following night they
again entered Ostroski's residence, but
did not steal anything although the
contents of a bureau drawer hud been
emptied on the floor.
I-adore Goodman's house, 1217 Geary
was enterid Monday night, but the
burglars wtra frightened away without
securing anything of value. They visited
the house the following night, but were
again frightened away.
An attempt was also made to enter the
bouse of Joseph Franklin, 1227 Geary,
but. the men were seen by a lady alight
ing from a car who gave tlie alarm and
the men disappeared.

DEMOCRATS SHY
OF RESIGNING
Dr. Mathews Will Not
Leave the State Library
at Present.
Oihers Will Emulate His Ex
ample and Hold Back Their
Resignations.
Governor Budd His a Choicj Lot of
Official Plums for Distribution
lo tbe Faithful.
Many Democrats and some Repuplicans
are anxiously awaiting the distribution of
the official plums at the disposal of Gov
ernor Budd. It is given out that the Gov
ernor will shortly appoint three directors
of the State Board of Agriculture. Ac
cording to the gossip, Jamea O'Brien of
Marysville ia already slated as one of the
three.
The five persons to be appointed by the
Governor to constitute the auditing board
to the Commissioner of Public Works
must not all belong to the same political
party, so the Governor will isave an op
portunity to recognize a Republican or a
Populist. Mr. Ferris of San Francisco
and Sol Runyon of Sacramento are said to
be slated for service on the board.
The proposed changes in the State
Library, the State Board of Health, the
Governor's secretaryship and the Code
Commission will not take place until
April 20.
One who knows the inside of the deal
sums up the situation in tnis style: Dr.
Mathews will not resign the office of State
Librarian until he is appointed secretary
of the State Board of Health. The doctor
is a Democrat of the old school. He read
ily comprehends the cold and gloomy fact
that the tth'ces n\ existence are not suffi
cient in number to enable tue Governor
to give all Democrats one apiece. He
holds one now and will not be foolish
enough to resign it until he is elected to
another equally as eood. Therefore when
the State Board of Health elects thedoctor
to the place of secretary ho will resign
from the library.
Miss Green was recently promoted to the
position of Assistant Librarian. When
Dana Perkins died Dr. Mathews was pro
moted from the position of assistant to
Librarian, but the vacancy In the office of
assistant was not filled untii a lew days
since.
E. D. McCabe, the present private secre
tary of Governor Budd, is slated to succeed
i>r. Mathews, but with that abundance of
caution which impels a good Democrat not
to relinquish one office until he gets a farm
grasp on another, Mr. McCabe will not re
sign the private secretaryship until his
election to succeed Dr. Mathews is made
saie and secure. McCabe utterly abhors
an interim. Later on, when Harbor Com
missioners Colnon and Harney are rÂ«*-en
forced by Rudolph Herold, Mr. McCabe
may be elected secretary of the board.
Peter Shiels, secretary of the Code Com
mission, is slated to succeed E. D. Mc-
Cabe as private secretary to the Governor,
but Mr. bhiels is also a man of superior
sagacity in holding office. He may not
have a â war-horse record to boast of, but
be knows the path to the public treasury
and how hard it is to find when one is un
fortunate enough to lose it. So Mr. Sbiels,
guided by war-horse judgment and ani
mated by Democratic repugnance to
resignation, will not resign the ofnee of
secretary of the Code Commiss.on until
he receives his appointment as private
secretary to Governor Budd. Meanwhile
A. Caminetti, ex-member of Congress and
ex-member of the Legislature, is waiting
to step into Mr. Shiels' place as secretary
of the Code Commissioners.
Before Governor Budd retires from of
fice he will have the agreeable duty to
perform of appointing three Commission
ers for Golden Gate Park. It is said that
he will appoint three of the best men in
San Francisco.
At last accounts A. J. Clunie had not
reeiyed his warrant as Insurance Com
missioner for Mr. Higgins' unexpired
term, but insurance men expect that Mr.
C unie will be appointed.

Open Day and livening.
ALL IN ONE SHORT DAY.
Variety of Spring Weather and What
It Leads To.
In the morning the snow fell as if mill
ions of wh te birds were shedding their
feathers. By noon the snow had turned
into a sullen, beating ram, yet the sun set
ia unclouded glory. That is the history
of ait American spring day. This sort of
spring does not inspire poet, but it un
ciiains the demon called Grip, and what
havoc he makes in the community! No
trouble to tell when he has begun bis mis
chief. The headache that banishes rest
by day and makes the night a long tor
ture; the pain in bone and muscle; ihe
nervousness; the cough that refuses to be
quieted, and the rawness ot" throat and
the soreness of lung, all tell the story.
Naturally tnis vicious loe to life has set
the doctors thinking, talking, and writing.
For once they are agreed. The best of all
Grip medicines is a stimulant to rouse
every latent energy of the body, and at the
same time to be free from every trace of
deleterious matter.
The ono stimulant that meets these con
ditions is Duffy' a pure malt whisky. 80
says public opinion; so says the medical
profession. Always, at this time of the
year, keep a bottle of this whisky in the
bouse, and you need have no fear of Grip
or of its consequences. For sale by all
druggists and grocers.

HUNTINGTON
IS AGAIN
ON TOP
Re-elected President of the
Southern Pacific
Company.
HIS ELECTION WAS NOT
UNANIMOUS.
Mrs. Stanford's Votes Agaio
Cast for General T. H.
Hubbard.
WILL H. CROCKER REFRAINED
FROM VOTING.
All the Former Oificors of the Corpo
ration Retained in Their
Places.
Collis P. Huntington was re-elected
president of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company yesterdayat the meeting of the
directors held in the private office of the
chief executive of the corporation. Ten
of the newly elected directors were pres
ent, as Jollows: C. P. Huntineton, H. Â£.
Huntington, Charles F. Crocker. Will K.
Crocker, Thomas H. Habbard, Rui-seil J.
Wilson, Charles G. Latbrop, J. 0. Stubbs,
Julias Kruttschnitt and N. T. Smith. The
only absentee was Thomas E. Stillman,
one of the Searles estate representatives.
General Hubbard presided and called the
meeting to order at noon.
The only- business transacted was the
election of officers for the ensuing; year.
It resulted in the re-election of every in
cumbent, as follows:
C. P. Huntington, president. New York;
Charles F. Crocker, vice- president, San Fran
cisco; Thomas U. Hubbartl, second vice-presi
dent, New York; J. c. Stubbs, third vice-presi
dent, Ban Francisco; H. K. Humington, as
sistant to president, San Francisco; 1. E. Gate*,
acting vice-president and assistant secretary,
New York: William Maul, second assistant to
president and controller, New York; E. C.
Wright, secretary and assistant controller,
Ban Francisco; C. F. Krebs, assistant secre
tary, .Louisville, Ky. ; William Hood.chlel en
gineer, San Francisco; N. T. Smith, treasurer,
Ban Francisco; F. H. Davis, assistant treas
urer. New York ; C. li. Kedington, assistant to
treasurer, Han Francisco.
Mr-. Stanford adhered to the same. pro
gramme that she carried out a year ago.
Sue was not present, out her two repre
sentativesâ Charles G. Laturop and Rus
â ell J. Wilson â acting under her instruc
tions, voted lor General Thomas H. Hub
bard, one of the representatives of the
Searies estate, for president, though with
out that gentleman's consent. This was
done in order to record her opposition and
disapproval of the Huntin^ton regime.
Will H. Crocker also followed the course
be pursued a year ago, and refrained from
votine for president. The otner directors
voted the stralgnt ticket, as previously
given.
The outcome was what was generally
predicted. The action of Mrs. Stanford
and Will H. Crocker was a disappoint
ment to the friend* of Huntinglon and to
the railroad people generally, it was
thought that Mrs. Stanford would be sat
isfied with having gone on record last
year as opposed to C. P. Huntington, and
that for the sake of having perfect har
mony in the directorate of the corporation
slie would lay aside her personal feelings
and vote with the majority. Strenuous
efforts to induce her to take such a con
servative course were made without avail.
Attempts were also made 10 prevail on
Will H. Crocker to come into the Hunt
ington fold, but he, too, remained obdu
rate. . â¢
The entire meeting did not last more
than half an hour.

Dr. W. G. Mizner Described
the Disgraceful Game
of Grab.
Men Carried Off Everything
Movable From the Lick
House Chambers.
eyertheless tha Bill cf the AttenJing
Physician Was Reduced From $5000
to $1650 by Judge Slack-
A partial glimpse of the remarkable
scene in the death chamber of the late
Senator James G. Fair was disclosed by
the testimony in Judge Slack's court
while the payment of Dr. W. G. Mizner's
fee was under consideration. It seems
to have been a most extraordinary
affair. Di. Mizner, who claimed a fee of
$5000 for his services, gave a description
that will be interesting to other wealthy
men who are thinking of shuffling off the
mortal coil under circumstances similar
to thoÂ«e attending Senator Fair's death
at the Lick House.
According to Dr. Mizner it was a dis
graceful spectacle. As the Senator lay
gasping his last upon the bed, men were
bundling papers and clothing into valises,
clearing tables, making away with every
thing in sight. Even a surgical instru
ment which Dr. Mizuer had laid upon the
table was taken; also the dying Senator's
watch. Charles L. Fair, Dr. Marc Leving
ston, J. S. Angus, L. C. Bresse, Herbert
Clark, the valet, and others were of the
party.
Some predatory strangers took advan
tage of the grief-stricken associates of the
dying millionaire and drove their nefari
ous operations to the extreme limit.
The scramble began while Fair was
breathing; his last, and continued after he
had expired. The physician had removed
his coal and cuff*. >.L.c better to render his
professional services to the Senator, and,
he said, he found it necessary to grasp
the garments quickly to save them from
being swept away with the other articles.
Dr. Livingston was asked to corroborate
Dr. Mizner's statement as to the scramble
in the death chamber, and particularly
with regard to the conduct of Angus and
Bresse. Bnt the doctor was conservative
and refused to describe the scene unless
compelled to do so. Judge Black decided
that the testimony would be immaterial.
Further testimony on this subject was
postponed till this morning.
The executors opposed the claim of Dr.
Mizner on the ground that be was em
ployed by Dr. Levingston, and not by eithei
the Senator or his son. Furthermore, as
the claim includes a fee for an autopsy
and for embalming, they said that these
latter services were performed for the
heirs, and the bill was therefore not justly
chargeable upon the estate. At most, they
said Dr. Mizner had no claim agaiust the
estate to exceed $1650.
James S. Angus was called to the stand
and examined by R. B. Mitchell.
"Mr. Angus, you are one of the special
administrators of the Fair estate?"
"I am."
"Did you have anything to do with the
appointment of Dr. Mizner to attend Sen
ator Fair?"
"I did not."
"After the death of Benator Fair did
you make any arrangements for an au
topsy ?"
"No; I consented to one being made if
â o desired by the heir"."
"But yon did not request Dr. Mizner to
make one?"
"No."
â¢â¢After the death of Senator Fair did
you remove any paners and effects from
the death chamber?"
â¢I did."
"Why did you do so?"
"Because 1 thought the proper place for
them was the sale in Senator Fair 1 ! pri
vate office. There were a good many
around, and I thought some might be
taken away."
In reply to cross-examination Mr. An
gus said that Dr. MiznÂ«r performed the
autopsy, but it was a; the request of the

heir?, and to them he must look for hia
pay.
Attorney Mitchell "aid he was willing
to have allowed to Dr. Mizner $600 more
than the originally computed $1650 lor
twenty-five analytical examinations at $8
and twenty microscopical examinations
at $20 apiece. These had been accident
ally added to the services performed after
the death of Senator Fair.
Judge S ack, however, decided to allow
only $1650. If there were any more claims
they must be settled by the heirs.
COLLATERAL INHEfiITANOE
Â« ...... i v Clerk Curry "Will Collect I.irgÂ«
Sums From Fair l.state Legatee*.
County Clerk Curry will have a chance
to handle some of the Fair estate funds
that will be paid into the county treasury
on account of the collateral inheritance
tax. The amounts to be collected on ac
count of orders of distribution recently
signed by Judge Slack are as follows:
From Charles O. Stewart, $158 13; Herbert

PURE FOOD CONGRESS.
The Attendance Will Be Much
Greater Than at First
Expected.
Thi Object to Decid Upou a Uniform
System of Enforcing the S ate
Laws.
From all accounts the Pur* Food Con
gress to be held in this City on April 30
will be of greater scope and larger at
tendance than its projectors expected.
Invitations will be sent all over the State
in the hope that of the many invited a
large number would respond. To the
gratification of the pure food committee
more invitations have already been ac
cepted than was expected. Governor
Budd will preside and with him will come
fifty delegates at large, all selected by
him.
Half of the members of the last Legis
lature have Minified their intention to be
present. Within the past three days the
chairman of the committee has received
letters showing thai, the interest in the
preservation of pure food is general all
over the State. The Supervisors of Santa
Barbara County decided to send ten dele*
gates aud $300 was appropriated for ex
penses. Los Angeles and San Diego coun
ties will also be represented by ten dele
gates eac:j. The people of those counties
are particularly interested in the move
ment, because it so materially interests
the honey industry of those sections. For
years the honey-raisers have suffered from
having the product of their bees adulter
ated with a number of cheap substances.
If there is any way to put a stop to this
practice they will do so.
From Santa Cruz will come the Mayor
and ten delegates, and a hke number will
be present from San Jose and Oakland.
Large representations will be present
from the Chambar ot Commerce, City and
btnte boards of trade, the Manufacturers'
and Froduc^rs' Association, Merchants'
Association, Mechanics' Institute, the
City and State boards of health and sev
eral other j ut.iic institutions and organ
ization?.
The number who have promised to at
tend is so great that it is believed that
the Chamber of Commerce hail will not
be large enough to accommodate them.
If possible, Metropolitan Temple will be
eiiL-ag.-d for the congress.
Many interesting papers will be reÂ«d,
but no two will be on the same lines.
Fifteen minutes will be allowed for each
in order that all may be heard.
The object of the* congress is to decide
upon a uniform system of enforcing the
State laws prohibiting the adulteration o f
and the sale of impure food products.

LAST TRIP OF
THE MONOWAI
She Arrived Yesterday
From Sydney and the
South Seas.
The Steamer Moana Will Be
Put oq the Run in Her
Place.
Waiting for the Doctorsâ Prospectors
Charter the Winchester
for Alaska.
The Monowai arrived yesterday 24 days
and 15 hours from Sydney, via Auckland,
Apia and Honolulu. Except for bead
winds and seas between Apia and Hono
lulu she had good weather during the trip.
When she arrived here the Inspector of
Immigration was on hand, but the doctors
were not, and after waiting an hour and a
half Captain Howard, superintendent of
the dock, ordered ail steerage passengers
ashore on his own responsibility.
This is the Monowai's last trip under
the house flag of tfce Oceanic Steamship
Company. Tne Moana wili take her place
on what would be her next run out. An
almost new set of officers will come with
the Moana, l he only ones to be taken from
the Monowai being Purser Bendell, Chief
Engineer McCraig ana Chief Officer
Graham. Captain Carey will stop by the
Monowai, and he will probably be kept in
southern waters.
When the Monowai arrived off the City
Hawaiian Cormul Wilder had a boat off to
meet her, seeking his mail from Honolulu.
Ho was anxious to secure it and his haste
coat him $5. The boat bailed the steamer
and asked for the Consul's mail. It was
thrown over but landed in tue water, and
it cost him just five to have the papers
fished up lor him.
The first mate of the bark General Fair
child fell overboard Wednesday night as
the vessel was passing over the bar in
tow of the tug Rescue. Captain Dan
Thompson of the Rescue dropped his tow
and went after the struggling seaman.
The mate, whose name was not learned
by Thompson, was hauled on board the
tug and afterward placed on the bark. Ke
suffered no ferious result* from the duck
ing he received.
The Alaska Traders' and Prospectors'
Company has chartered the schooner
Winchester that is now lying in Oakland
Creek. The Winchester is 300 tons bur
den, and she win be got ready for the trip
before April 25. The destination decided
upon is the mouth of the Yukon River
via Cooks Inlet and Bt. Michaels Island.
The ichooner will be sone about six
months, and each member of the expe
dition must pay $_'00 for the trip up and
down and his slay during the time tne ex
pedition remains in the north. A. P. Mc-
Ivevin, P. J. Newman, A. H. Slate, W. L.

THE CAUSE OF CUBA.
A Big Meeting Planned to Arrange for
Raining Funds.
There was a largely attended meeting of
the executive committee of the Cuban
League at 2006 Mason street last evening
at which arrangements were 1 made for a
big general meeting next , Wednesday
evening at California Hall, 620 Bush
street. . ,
An invitation was extended to all sym
pathizers in Cuba's straggle for freedom
in particular ana the public in general to
attend the meeting. The purpose of the
gathering will be to devise ways and
means for raising money for the cause.:
All of the other States in the Union
have contributed, and there is a^great de
sire to have this State represented in the
good work in a monetary way. The in
surgents require medicines, bandages, sur
gical instruments, food and clothing, and
â¢very dollar counts, so the local members
of the league state, and they hope to be
able to send to the headquarters a
eocd, fat purse. At that meeting tnere
will be a largp number of able speakers.
The secretary reported that every day
large numb rs of names are being received
of people who have siened me petition to
Congress to take action in the Cuban
struggle for liberty. Signatures are com
ing from ail directions, Los Angeles, San
Jose, San Diego and Butte, Mont. L'ltalia,
the local Italian paper, has received over
300 names.
It is expected, when tha country
papers take up the matter, as they have
been requested, that by June 1, the league
will have nearly 20,000 names to present
to Congress.

sent the following letter:
San Francisco, April 5, 1897.
William M. Bunker Esq., chairman Citizens'
Committee for Relief of Vnempl yed. Chamber of
Commerce, Sun Francisco, Cal.â LH;ab Sir: lam
in receipt ol your letter ol the Ist inst., which
I have read most carefully and with much in
terest. 1 will subscribe to the relief fund one
hundred dollars ($100), and trust that you
may find as many otliurs to do their part as
will suffice to make up the $16,000 needed. I
do this all the more readily because I am
assured by you that the money is given
to men who are willing to earn it. It
does seem to me tnat there ought to be enough
work, either in the City or country, to keep
constantly employed the 2600 men who, you
say, have registered their applications. In too
many cases it is a tact that men who are out
of work and whose families need it are not
willing to go into the country and onto the
farms, preferring worry and suffering, and
sometimes almost starvation, to even a tempo
rary exile from lhe large towns, which return
them in some degree the pleasures of life- I
think this is the case very largely at the
East, where the streets of our great cities are
tramped daily by multitudes of idle men,
some oi whom are willing to work any where
and at anything, many of whom are willing
to work providing they can get it in the
city, and I believe the greatest number of
whom do not want work at all, but the where
with to keep them from the necessity of work
ing. lam inclined to believe that the great
majority of men who really want work can get
it somewhere, ana I am certain that if such a
man goes to wi rk with an honesty of
purpose, nnd exercises an intelligent econ
omy, making a point of living on less
than he makes, no matter what he makes,
and no matter how much sacrifice of
comfort or pleasure it Involves, he will not, in
one case out oi a hundred, ever need again to
seek employment; for such men tire valunble
everywhere and always. They make good
citizens and are the foundation of a prosper
ous people.
I Know that when I was a boy I never had
any difficulty in finding plenty to do, nnd I
think perhaps one reason was because when I
worked I went at it with a;l my might, never
watching the clock to see when it was time to
begin or when the regulation hour for stop
ping had arrived. My income was small then,
but the outgo waa invariably something less,
and it was only a question of time in my case â
as it must be in the case of every man whose
rule of life is the seme â when I should have
three hands instead of two to work with, for
capital iÂ» a great servant, and its strength
when careinlly and intelligently exercised,
grows greater and greater. Men and women
require, as a matter of necessity, very few
things to make them comfortable, and
if they have small means the surest way to
contentment and happiness is to reduce their
desires to the levol of their needs unll they
can afford to Indulge them. Particularly In
the ca.to of the young does this seem to me to
be oi first importance, for one can well afford
to sacrifice the pleasures of a few of his early
years for the sake of lhe free'iom from anxiety
which he will find such a boon and comfort in
his declining days, nnd if we had schools to
teach these simple first principles of right liv
ing I think it would be money well expended
to establish them. lam very truly yours,

There is grief in Chinatown became
United States Commissioner Heacock yes
terday afternoon decided that Jenc Ngan
Ying, tbe Chinese woman who swore yes
terday that she was a native of San Fran
cisco, should be aent back to China,
whence she came.
Commissioner Heacock, in renderine hi<*
decision ordering the girl to be remanded
in custody, showed that be had a keen
appreciation of the untrustworthiness of
Chinese evidence in sued cases. The court
agreed with Lawyer Mowry that the
burden of proof lay upon the prosecution
to show that Miss Ying was not born in
the United States, but he took issue with
the statement of the lawyer that the pros
ecution had not produced a scintilla of
evidence to show that she was not a native
of this country. On 'the contrary, the
Commissioner had found ample proof of
the fact that she had been born in China.
He found that Miss Ying, the defend
ant, had made various contradictory
statements to serve her purpose. She
made denials to Dr. Gardiner on two
widely separated occasions and had re
peated her denials to Inspector Jackson.
The court was of the opinion that the
Collector of the Port had not had access
to all the facts in the case and had not had
the available evidence before him, other
wise he would have ruled differently. As
it was he was simply mistaken. The.
Commissioner added that he was fully
convinced that the woman was not born
in the United States, but that she was a
native of China, and he recommended
that she be depot ted to the country
whence she came.
The esses of the two other Chinese
women arrested by Inspector Jackson will
be taken up at 11 o'clock tin-* morning.

JOOST'S
MERCURY
DEPOSIT
It Was Discovered by the
Railway Builder's
Little Son.
THE LAD WAS PLAYING
PROSPECTOR.
Confidence of the Father That
There Is a Fortune in
the Mine.
SAYS HE WILL HOT SELL THE
PRO PERI Y.
He Declares He Will Proceed at
Ones to Erect a Plan*, but
Wants No Callers.
Behrend Joost is more positive than
ever that bis recent discovery of the pres
ence of native mercury on his Twin Peake
property Is destined to put an immense
fortune in his hands.
He bad experts at work on the rock
taken from the mine yesterday, and they
agreed that unless the vein tarns out to be
too small a grand strike has been made.
So far as can be ascertained at present the
vein is three feet wide and runs obliquely
into the earthâ how far, though, noDody
can tell. Mr. Joost also submitted some
of the rock, and the free mercury taken
from it, to the Tread well brothers of Brad
ford mine fame, and they, too, declared
that the discovery gave promise of return
ing great profit*.
It develops now that Joost's mine was
not discovered by a workman, aa at first
reported, but by Mr. Joost's eleven-year
old son, Benny. Tbe lad, it is said, long
since exhibited a taste for mining and
minerals, and in this was encouraged by
his Darents. It has been tbe boy's custom
for some time past to jio out on the hills
with his iittle pick and shovel every after
noon after scbool and practice at pros
pecting. It was his ambition to locate a
vein of gold-bearing quartz, for he had
leard once that ote of that character had
been found several tiroes in this vicinity.
So it happened, then, that one day about
a fortnight ago he due into a ridge not far
from his home and uncovered the rock
which the officials ot tbe State Mining
Bureau, the experts and the Treadwella
say is rich with native mercury. The lit
tle fellow did not know what it was at the
time and was puzzled when he saw the
bead-like globules of quicksilver tumbling
out of the rock. He took it to his lather
for an explanation, but the elder Joost
was equally in the dark until after he had
submitted the ore to experts.
Tbe elder Joost professes to be consider
ably put out over the publicity that has
been uiven to his supposed good fortune,
it having been his intention to keep tbe
matter quiet, he says, until be had ascer
tained just what he bad. The Call's ex
clusive story yesterday was a great sur
prise to him. But now that the secret is
out, he has cast ull raticence aside, with
one exception, and that is that he will not
divulge tbe exact location of the mine.
"I feel confident that Benny has discov
ered a fortune," said Mr. Joost when seen
i yesterday, "and out of compliment to him
I am going to name the mine after him.
I am sorry that this matter got to the pub
lic ear so soon, because I hoped to go on
developing the mine and testing the pro
ductive qualities witbout having a crowd
of idlers and curiosity-seeker* â and I may
add, rcoffers, as well â around the place.
"You know stories have gone out re
garding alleged discoveries of gold, quick
silver and other precious metals on the
San Francisco peninsula, but none of
tbem ever amounted to anything. lam
serious about this affair of mine, but I
don't care about being looked upon as a
dreamer, and to be laughed at.
'â¢I want to say one thing right now, and
that is that none of my land in the vicin
ity of this mine is for sale, and therefore
I "do not want any boom worked up for it.
I liavp about 700 acres upon and around
Twin Peaks, and I propose to keep it.
If I have a good quicksilver deposit
there, and I nope I nave, it seems to me
that I can profit better by keeping it and
working it myself, than I can by disposing
of the property. It may not amount to
anything at all, and in that event nobody
i: out a nickel but myself. It is my
intention to begin wotk modestly and
economically. I will have constructed a
small retort shortly ana get right down to
business. I don't think I wiJl be long i
finding out whether I have made a strike
or am doomed to disappointment.

With Perilâ Etta H Ran to
Form-
The delightful weather and a rather
catchy - lookins card attracted a large
crowd 10 the track across the bay yestei
terday. The betting, which on the day
preceding! was inclined to be sluegisb,
suffered a reaction, and the men on the
block indulged in no naps and wnistlea
do rhapsodies in minor keys.
K^ord- break ing was freely predicted,
bat the class of horses starting never cave
old Father Time cause for alarm. The
sport was devoid of incident or accident,
and as three of six favorites crossed the
wire rirst the ta!ent grumbled not.
â  Charley Thorpe, who could ride a saw
horse and get him home first, had the
mount on Peril in the opening event, a
six-furiong sprint with welter-weights up,
and landed the mare winner from Ve
ragua, a well- backed tip. Logan, starting
an 8 to 5 choice, finished third.
The wise ones said the track was too
hard for Gutta Percha and allowed her to
go practically friendless in the betting on
the six-furlong spin that followed. At
odds of 15 to 1 she led all the way, and
tvon cleverly from Trappean. Colonel
Wheeler, the favorite, was never promi
nent.
It was freely distributed around that j
the .Baldwin stable folts fancied the j
the chances of Key Salazar to carry off '
the purse hung tip for the two-year-olds, !
yet his odds receded from 5 to 2 to 18 to 5. j
Isom handled him badly and third was !
ihe best he could do. Front de Boeuf, the j
4 to 5 favorite, won easily from Elsmore, |
an 8 to 1 shot.
Tally Coulter's old horse Redskin was
the hot one for the seven-furlong run, but
he couldn't land. Jones rushed Salhe
Clicquot away in the lead, and Green
Morns' mare was never headed, leading
Coulter's norse out at the wire by four
lengths in zhe ordinary time o* 1 :29. Lady
Diamond, on which "Skeets" Martin in
dulged in considerable filagree work, was
a bang-up third, and will bear watching
in future.
All of the big bettors jumped aboard
Cabrillo to capture the mile, and, backed
down from 6 to 5 to 7 to 10, he was in
iront almost from the start, and led Don
Clarencio out at tue finisu by half a
length. The latter colt was last of his
field down th^ back stretch and made a
great run. With a better rider he would
have given the winner a very strong argu
ment. May R, with odds of 40 to 1 about
her, was third.
The good Flambeau filly Etta H defeat
ed her rield in the last "event decided, a
-x- furlong purse affair, very cleverly.
Starting a 6 to 5 choice, Snider goi her
ov r the line a length in advance of Shasta
Water, a filly which started here lor the
first time this season. Midiight, the sec
ond choice, away from the post none too
veil, took the show.

JEFFRIES IS ALL RIGHT.
He "Will Meet Van J'.usUirk To-Mght
and Is in First-Clasa Con.
ditioo.
It was reported yesterday afternoon
that Jeffries, the Los Angeles heavy
weight who is to meet Van Buskirk this
evening at the People's Palace, had
sprained the ankle or his right foot yes
terday while practicing in an Oakland
athletic club, but when the managers of
the National Ciub were seen last evening
they said there was no truth in the rumor,
and that Jeffries was as sound as a dollar.
Gibbs thought the report was started by
some of tt;e gamblers to influence the bet
ting, which was liveiy last evening in the
poolrooms, Jeffries selling favorite at 10
to 7.
Tne backers of Van Buskirk will, it is
thought, open up their purse-strings this
evening, as the suoporters of the Los
Angeles champion will not give any better
odds than are now offered. Professor
Watson of the Olympic Club is very
sanguine that "Van 1 ' will whip Jeffries,
because he thinks "Van 1 ' is as hard a
hitter and a better ring general than his
opponent.
Two ten-round bouts will be witnessed
before the event of the evenine is called
by the "Honorable" Hiram Cook, referee.
; Homer McCoy, a brother of the well--
I known pueiliat "Kid" McCoy, will engage
in a passage-at-arms with Hen Slater.
The sports are of the opinion that
Slater will be declared a winner, as Mc-
Coy is too delicate a fellow to stand much
punishment.
Morrisseyand Maxwell should "put up"
[ a good hard fight, and as they are pretty
! evenly matched the gnessers will have no
i easy time to call a winner, but Morrissey
will, in all probability, tnfce the lonr end
of the purse. A large gathering of the
lovers of the game of fisticuffs is expected
| tc-night at the People's Palace to witness
the scraps.
Kobbed Ilis Partner.
Harry J. Fortune was arrested last night by
Detective Graham on a warrant charging him
with grand larceny. The complaining wit
ness is T. J. Walsh, saloon-keeper, 13 Third
street. He and Fortune were partners, and
Walsh alleges that Fortune stole $165 from
the safe and $30 trom the cash register last
week and disappeared.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 9, 1897.
COLONEL WILLIAM R. SHAFTER, Who Has Been Made a.
Brigadier-General.
AT LAST A STAR
FALLS TO SHAFTER
He Is Nominated Brigadier-
General of the Regular
Army.
During the Past Ten Years He
Was "Jumped" by Five
Junior Crioneis.
The New General's War Record and
His Splendid Campaign Against
Hostile Indians.
The President yesterday nominated
Colonel William R. Shatter, First In
fantry, U. 6. A., to be brigadier-general,
to till the vacancy caused by the promo
tion of Wheaton major - general, vice
Ruger retired.
The promotion of Colonel fehafter, al
ready long delayed, is bailed with satis
faction In army circles at the Presidio and
by thousands of civilians of California.
Last evening Coionel S. B. M. Young, pest
commander at the Presidio, sent a mes
sage of congratulation Dy wire to Colonel
Shaiter. The latter is in Washington on
a month's leave of absence.
When this leave expires he will return
to the Presidio, pact up his effects and
proceed to tne command of whatever de
partment he may be assignod to. It is
presumed that he will be ordered to the
Department of the Columbia to succeed
General Otis, who will go to the Depart
ment of Dakota.
Colonel Shatter has an excellent mili
tary record. He entered the volunteer ser
vico as first lieutenant of the Seventh
Michigan Infantry August, 1301, and
served one year as adjutant of that regi
ment.
lie was wounded at the battle of Fair
OaKs, Va., and promoted to major of the
Nineteenth Michigan Infantry. He was
again promoted to Jieutenant-colonel of
tne Nineteenth Michigan. In 1864 he was
commissioned colonel of th* Seventeenth
Colored Infantry. On March 16, 1565, he
was brevettei brigadier-general for gal-
Jant and meritorious service. He was
mustered out of the volunteer service in
18tiG and the same year appointed lieuten
ant-colonel of the Foriy-first United
States Infantry and brevetied colonel in
the regular army for gallant services at
the battle of Fnir Oaks.
By the consolidation of regiments in
1869 Colonei Shatter wa9 assigned to the
Twenty-fourth United States Infantry
as Jieutenant-colonel. In March, 1879, he
was promoted colonel of the First United
States Infantry.
Colonel Shatter since the war served
with renown in Texas, on the Rio Grande
frontier. He was mentioned by General
Ord as one of the most active and ener
getic officers of bis rank in the pursuit and
punishment of hostile Indians. It was
tne custom of the Indians of that region
to make desperate raids and when pur
sued io scatter to the Slaked Plains, where
they alone knew where water could be
lound. -Colonel Shatter in one pursuit
pushed across the plains to toe Pecos
River, going nearly sixty hours without
water. The campaign was conducted with
so mush'activity and resolution that the
hosiiles, renegades and thieves were pun
ished severely.
The First' lnfantry, United Btates army,
is regarded as one of the best infantry
regiment*, if not the best, in the regular
service, and much of the credit for its
efficiency and superiority is due to Colonel
Shatter.
Ii is a mystery in military circles why
Colonel Sbttfter's promotion has been so
loni: delayed. As a coionel he was lbe
senior in rank of Brooke, Otis, Forsyth,
Bliss and Coppiuger, each of whom has
been commissioned brigadier-general.
During his service in Texas he was ac
cused of being what was tuen termed an
"offensive partisan." It is surmised that
influence was exertÂ«d against him in
Washington on this account. The theory
that prevails in the army is that socieiv
and personal influences "of a powerful
character were exerled in behalf of the
successful colonels rather than against
Bbattpr.
Colonel Shatter was recently nominated
to succeed Colonel S. B. M. Younp as
commander of the Loyal Legion, Califor
nia Cornmandery. There is no doubt of
his election, but it is thought he may re
sign iuiÃ honor on his departure from the
Btate.
Lieutenant- Colonel Cook of the Fourth
Infantry will probably be promoted to
the coionelcy of the First Infantry, vice
Shafter, ana may come to the Presidio as
post commander. Colonel Young, Fourth
Cavalry, who has been appointed superin
tendent of the Yellowstone Park, will re
main at the Presidio as post commander
until May 1. He will not start on the
march from Walla Walla to Yellowstone
until tho mountain passes are clear of
deep snows.

GRAND GATHERING
OF TRAFFIC MEN
The Staff of the Southern
Pacific to Meet at
Monterey.
Agents Summoned From All
Parts of the United
States.
An Innovation to Be Inaugurated or
the Suggestirn of President
Huntington.
Collis P. Huntington has decided to in
augurate a new departure in the traffic
department.
Already instructions have gone out
to every traffic officer and commercial
agent of the company throughout the
United States and to the European agent
stationed In Hamburg, to be present on
the I3ih of April at Monterey, Cal., at a
grand gathering, designed to strengthen
the esprit dv corps of all the members of
the traffic manager's staff. The reunion
will also nartake largely of a social func
tion.
Traffic Manager J. C. Stubbs has charge
of all the preliminary arrangements and
yesterday made the following statement
relative to the matter:
By the approval of the president and direc
tors ol the .Southern Pacific Company a meet
ing of the traffic officers and commercial
agents, located in the various places iv the
United States, including the European gen
eral ageut, hag been called and will take place
at Hotel del Monte on Tuesday, the 13th inst.
For several years the principal officers of
the company have thought it advisable that
such a meeting should be held, and it is ex
pected that this meeting will be so instructive
and beueticial as to warrant repetition bien-
I nlally.
The object of the meeting is: First, to give
the foreign officers and agents â those located
nt i>oints noi on the line of the roadâ en op
portunity to see the linen ana the country
they serve, so that they may the more intelli
gently give information to the public; sec
ondly, to meet and know each other person
ally ; thirdly, to confer and advise with each
other as to the characteristics of the traffic
peculiar to the many separate districts and
territories in which they are employed to
work, to ouggest improvements in the" direc
tion of efficiency in accommodating the pub
lic and economy in conducting the traffic
affairs.
Those who will be present are the fol
lowing:
J. C. Stubbs, third vice-president; E. Haw
ley, assistant general trnffic manager.

VALUE OF THE
WATER PLANT
Testimony Before the Sup
ervisors on the
Subject.
Ex-Mayor Pond Gives His Judg
ment as a Financial
Expert.
Engineer Schussler Explains Why
Spring Vdlley Stock Hjs Risen
Two Points in a Few Days-
More testimony was taken last night by
the Supervisors in committee of trie
whole on the water question. Engineer
Scbussler explained that Spring Valley
Water stock had risen two points within
the last few days because the public had
confidence in the showing made by the
company during the present investiga
tion before the Supervisors.
When the board assembled Dr. Eottanzi
moved, and the motion was unanimously
carried, that when the board adjourned it
should do so out of respect to the mem
ory of Supervisor Smith's father, who
died on tho day be f ore.
Dr. Clinton presided over the delibera
tions of the committee of the whole and
called K. ii. Stettin as a witness with ref
erence to the complaint made by him at
a previous meeting that he had been
charged by Agent Perley of the Spring
Valley Water Company a rate of 20 cents
for every 1000 bricts used on his new
building on Leavenworth street, near Mc-
Allister. Mr. Stettin explained that Mr.
Perley's brother, who is not employed by
the water company in any capacity, bad
informed him that 20 cents per 10C0 bricks
for the water used on the building would
be charged him. At that time there were
6000 bricks in the building, and when the
building was finished it had 11,000 bricks
in it.
Mr. Stettin's contract with Agent Per
ley was read. It snowed that he had
agreed to pay $2 for water used in the
construction of the building "according
to the established rates." Mr. Stettin had
not paid, and had not been charged a cent
more than $2 for the whole building. The
gentleman evidently misunderstood the
matter, and the board, threatened with
astigmatism of the intellect, dropped him
and called Mr. Perley.
Perley's initials are A. S., and he proved
to be a very intelligent witness. He had
made an estimate of the number of brick
and the Darreis of cement to go into the
building, ami he had lumped the value of
the water at $2, and got a contract for that
sum from Mr. Stettin. He should have
charged $4, because there were a cement
sidewalk and considerable plastering in
the house.
Ferley made the surprising announce
ment that since January 1 of this year hs
had collected $272 15 for water for build
ings at a cost oi $300, and Mayor Fhelan
facetiously inquired whether he didn't
want a partner ai that business.
Hilas A. White, a p:oneer school
teacher, was called by Dr. Clinton as an
expert on the market rale of interest on
gas and other securities. Mr. White con
fessed that he owned two buildings, one
erected in the days of '49 the other in
the spring of '50. and he could not
keep them filled with tenants all the
time. He thought tbat 5 per cent would
be a fair rate of interest, He did not own
any water stock. In fact, he said, he was
too poor to buy any. He could cot get 5
per cent on his real estate investments.
'Would you be satisfied with 5 per
cent 7" asked the Mayor.
"I wouldn't be satisfied if I got 25 per
cent. I am a Tery grasping man," re
sponded Mr. White amid the laughter of
the board. He added ttiat he would swap
his real estate at current rates for water
stocK at Its market price and would pay a
bonus of $1000 beside.
It was his opinion that the water com
pany could iigure better than the Super
visors.
"The company will always get the best
of you," he s<aid. "Sau Francisco should
own her own water works."
Ex-Mayor E. B. Pond pave his opinion
to Ihe effect that 5 per cent upon the com
pany's valuation of its stock would be
fair, and t! per cent on the actual value
would be plenty.
In answer to questions by Mayor
Phelan, witness said mat $23,000,000" of
bonds of the City ana Coumy of Sau
Krancisco could be placed at '6% per cent.
The interest on that sum wouni amount
to $805,000, while the City was paying the
water company 1400,000 a year more "than
that sum.
The company paid 15 per cent to its
stockholders some years ago, but the rate
of interest has declined within thÂ»> last
ten years. British consols return 2?4 per
cent interest and sell for 114. The h.ber
nia Bunk, he said, paid its term deposi
tors 4.-0 per cent and its ordinary deposi
tors 3.50.
On second thought, Mr. Pond believed
that water bonds of the City and County
of San Francisco could be sold at par ami
at 3 per cent interest. He believed that
an equal sunply of water could be brought

to this City for much Seas than $23,000.0G0,
the bprine Valley's overvaluation. More
than tne present supply could be brought
to this city lor $15,000,000. He cased that
statement upon the opinion of experts and
his own knowledge of the country.
Dr. Canton asked Engineer Schussler
ana Mr. why the company had
not obeyed the recent order of the board
to place meters in certain public squares
and schoolhouses in this City, and both
gentlemen replied that they did not know.
Mr. Schussler, in reply to tne Mayor,
said that the present stock issue of the
company was $12 800.000, and it was the
intention to issue $800,000 more, provided
that the company should carry out its
plans of new construction for the Potrero
Heights reservoir and other work.
"It the interest is reduced to 5 per cent,"
he added, "I don't ihink we would realize
more than SO cents on the dollar, and wu
would have to sell a good many more
shares in order to raise the money
needed."
The Mayor asked why it was that the
stock of the company had risen from $97
to $99 since the beginning of the present
investigation, when the prospects were
that the company's revenues might be cut
down so as to represent only 5 per cent of
the valuation.
"I suppose," replied Mr. Schussler,
"that the value rose iv the market because
we have made such a goo l showing before
you, and because a good many people
think that we have not been treated ex
actly fairly by you in your conduct of this
investigation. I believe that the public
thinks that we ougnt to have 6 per cent.
Talking about reducing to 5 per cent and
doing so are entirely different things. Re
duce it to 5 per cent and you will see how
soon the stock will drop to $80."
Inquiry was next made into the cost of
the Calaveras property of the company.
Mr. Schussler said that the company paid
$1,000,000 for the property of ttie Alameda
Water Company from Charles N. Felton.
It might not have been worth that sum
then, but the Spring Valley Water Com
pany needed that source of supply for
future demands, and could not do with
out it.
Mayor Pheian took the stand as a wit
ne.-s, and said that the New "York Central
Railway Company's stock paid o per cent.
He considered that 5 per cent would be a
reasonable allowance to the Spring Valley
Company on a reasonable valuation oi its
property.
Money could be borrowed on Spring
Valley stock at 4 per cent. In the City
there is money to loan at 2% and 3 per
cent on United States bonds as security.
Some of the banks here are loaning money
for HJ-2 and 7 per cent. The rate is regu
lateu also by the size of the sum loaned.
The committee of tne whole rose, re
ported progress and announced that it
would meet, next Thursday night. That
will in all probability be the last meeting
at which testimony will be takeA.
NEW STREET PAVEMENTS
The Teamsters Exchange Views
Upon the Important
Subject.
Asphalt and Wood io Have a Trial
Alongside of Bitumen and
Basa t
At a conference recently held between
the directors of tbe Merchants' Association
and the Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors upon the various materials
used for street pavements in San Fran
cisco and in other cities it was decided to
ascertain which materials are be~t
adapted to the streets of San Francisco.
With this object in view a meeting of the
draymen ana teamsters of the City was
called at the assembly-rooms in the Mills
building for lust night, as it was deemed
advisable to bold a conference with them
for the purpose of ascertaining their
views and wishes in this important
matter.
Various ideas were exchanged regarding
the best pavements for the business por
tion of the City. D. L. Farnsworth stated
that he was in fall accord with the associ
ation in securing good smooth pavements,
but of such material as would be durable
and yet suitable for teaming. The bitu
men had its objection, which every team
ster had discovered to his cost.
After a general exchange of opinions it
was finally decided to permit the use of
aspbalt and wood to be laid on Market
street, under the specifications provided
by the engineer of the Merchants' Asso
ciation, as a sample.
Michael Doane spoke of the manner in
winch the street railroad companies had
been permitted to pave the streets be
tween the tracks so as to prevent the use
of the same by teams. Ho said some
thing should be done to compel them to
pave in conformity with tne other por
tions of the streets.
In response to a question regarding
basalt blocks, Engineer McCulloogh gave
it as his opinion that if the blocks were
laid en two inches of sand as a bed with
half an inch space between them, into
which hot asphalt would be poured, it
would make a good pavement, durable
and binding.
The question of brick pavement was
passed, "as the experiment had no sup
porters; but asphalt and wood was recom
mended by a unanimous vote as experi
ments.
Fire Commissioners.
The Fire Commissioners met yesterday
afternoon, when Frank Skelly, hoseman 01
engine 30, and X Murphy of track 1 ten
dered their r^signaiions, which were ac
cepted. George Lynch was appointed to en
gine 30 and Dau Donovan to truck 1. Mor
timer Kelly of truck 6 was charged with
neglect ot duty and drunkenness, but the
charges were not sustained.

MUNICIPAL PLANT
Mayor Thomas' Message
Has Caused Citizens to
Think.
Victor Metcalf Says There Is
No Necessity for Any
Change.
President Diogee Declares That His
Plant Is F^r Sale Should the
City Want It.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, April 8. )
President Din^ee of the Oakland "Water
Company made the startling announce
ment to-day that if the city wanted to buy
a plant bis company is ready to talk busi
ness.
The portion of Mayor Thomas' Inaugu
ral which referred to the existing war be
tween the water companies in this city
has caused much comment, as it is the
first time that the chief executive has
clearly advocated municipal ownership of
water works. Mayor Thomas said:
''The conditions prevailing iv this city
1 respect to our water supply are most
arious and unnatural. That it will con
tinue is contradicted by reason and ex
] erience. Two water companies strug
gling for supremacy are engaged in a rate
war which has brought about a reduction
to t;.e consumer unparalleled in our
State's history. Both of these corpora
tions claim to be suffering great losses in
money at prevailing rates. It is true that
these losses will ultimately find their way
into the bonded indebtedness of the com
pany, and the consumer will be compelled
to pay not only interest on the present
losses, but eventually on the principal as
well. It is a law that hostile moneyed in
terests invar. ably prefer to bury their
hatred and come together for joint profit
at the public s expense rattier ihan suffer
continued losses."
Victor H. Metcalf, attorney for the old
company, the Contra Costa corporation,
said to-Uay that he sees no necessity for
municipal ownership in Oakland at this
time. 'When a company conies into a
city," said Mr. Metcali. "and establishes
a plant for supplying what I believe are
called public utilities they should be well
treated, as an encouragement to others to
come and do likewise. I do not see why
any one can say at this time that Oakland
needs a municipal water plant. Judging
by what I hear and see, and by compari
son with other parts of the State, I think
Oakland is about as well supplied with
water at this time as any one could de
sire."
William J. Dingee, the president of the
Oakland Water Company, differs in his
views from Mr. Me teal f. He is not particu
larly anxious to discuss water matters for
publication, out when asked hia opinion
o.' Mayor Thomas' statement, he said:
â¢There is no aoubt whatever iv my
mind that there is a growing sentiment
in this country and especially in th-r State
of California in favor of municipal owner
ship of such things as water and gas
tf.arr.s. l regard Mayor Thomas' address
aU a yer y ae rious proposition, for it seems
ta carry modern ideas one point further
than any other Mayor we have had. Re
garding tvs remarks concerning the man
ner in which capital will ultimately pro
tect itself when brought to bay, I do not
care to say anything. But 1 do think that
municipal ownership is bound to be a fac
tor in future politics of all parties. All
over this State sentiment in its favor is
growing.
"If this city should decide to own a
water plant there is nodoubtthat she will
parebsae some plant already in existence,
for it is absurd to suppose that With the
adequate water supply in Oakland at this
time any government would advocate the
building of another plant. If this city
wants to buy and operate a water plant I
wan; to state clearly that we are out to
?eil and now is a good time for Oakland to
acquire a new plant at a low figure."
CONDEMN BROTHER POTTS.
Afro- Americans Object to Abuse of
the New Civil Klghta Bill.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 8. )
The Afro-American Lea.ue of Alameda
County had an interesting meeting last
ni^ht at which resolutions were passed
condemning the action of William Potts,
the colored man who went into a barber
shop and, because he was refus-d a shave,
brought an action under tne new law for
damages.
Several prominent colored folks from
this city were at Sacramento when thÂ»
bill was under discussion. It was shown
that with the protection of the bill a col
ored man with corrupt motives could in
vade any establishment where it was cer
tain his presence would not be desired,
and that when requested to leave he would
be in a position to demand tribute for
doing bo.
I The colored lobbyists indignantly deny
Â»Â£at such would be the practice, and stated
that if any one attempted to take advan
tage of the bill in such a manner, they
would be the first to condemn it. William
Potts recently went into a barber Â»hop
kept by White and demanded a shave,
This notion on his part has proved ob
jectionaDle to the Afro-American Leaguts
of this county and last night the following
resolutions were unanimously passed:
Whereas, The daily papers of to-day, April
7, 1897, report an action being commenced
by one William Potts in Alameda County,
under the recent Dibble civil rights bill,
enacted by the last Leeislatnre, for being re
fused accommodation by some barber-shop in
the city of Oakland; and whereas, while we
believe that the civil rights of every citizen
should be respected, still we seriously con
demn the idea of any citizen Intruding upon
any business place for the sole purpose of
being refused in order to brln< a damage suit
under the provisions of said bill; therefore
be it
Resolved, That the executive committee of
the Afro- American League of Alameda County
condemn in the severest terms the suit com
menced by said William Potts, not only be
cauÂ«e the action appears to be brought for the
avowed purpose of securing the damage*
provided in paid bill, but by reason of the bill
not taking effect and being in full force until
sixty days after its passage, which will not be
until some time in the month of May, 1897.

COMMITTED SUICIDE.
A Prisoner Kills Himself in Hla Cell
by Asphyxiation âNo Known
Cause for the Deed.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April B.â Wleu the
cells in the City Prison were opened this
morning ii was found that a prisoner who
had given bis name as C. Johnson had
committed suicide during the night by
asphyxiation. Johnson, who said he was
a Swede, was arrested yesterday afternoon
on a charge of robbing a drunken man of
$10 at the High-street station of the nar
row-gaugo. He was seen in the act by a
neighbor, who notified the police, and the
arrest followed. Johnson said tie was a
tramp, and that he came from San Jose.
He was locked up in a eteel "tank" cell,
about 10 feet by 8 in size, ventilated only
by the wicket in the door and a small
opening in the roof. It is lighted by a
gas jet, the stopcock of which is outside
and cannot be reached by a prisoner. But
Johnson prepared deliberately for death.
He stuffed the wicket and the opening in
the rooi with his blanket, then blew out
the gas aud, lying down in bis bunk,
calmly waited for death. On a scrap ot
paper he leit a scrawl, "I OUgbt to have
known better." So closely did he stop up
all ventilation to the cell that the odor of
the escaping gas did not reach any one,
while as that part of the jail is not visited
at night by the officers the tact that the
light was not burning was not noticed.
He had been dead for hours when his
body was discovered.
NO RECEIVING HOSPITAL.
A Discovery That the Law Does Not
Permit the County to Maiut.iii
Such an Institution in
a City.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 8. -For some
time past the matter of having the county
maintain a receiving hospital in this city
has been agitated, and it was believed
that the proposition, which is a very ne
cessary one, would be carried out. The
matter was referred to the District Attor
ney, and greatly to the disappointment of
the advocates of the proposition that of
ficial reports that he can find no warrant
in law for asking the couuty to pay for
the maintenance of a receiving hospital in
a city. The expense should be borne by
tne city itself. Besides depriving Alame
dii of the benefit of such an institution
his decision goes further and materially
affects the Oakland Hospital, whoso ex
pense up to this time has been borne
by the county. In ihe luture, if the Dis
trict Attorney's decision holds good, the
city will have to stand tue expense. Ala
me.a will be unable to establish and
maintain a hospital dur.ng this fiscal
year, as the tax levy has been made and
no provision was, of course, made for any
such emereency. Consequently the mat
ter will have to co over a year.
Death or J. L. Fast.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April B.â Judson L.
Fast, a well-known and very popular re.-i
--cteut of this city, died early Una morning
at his residence, 2203 San Antonio avenue.
His death was very unexpected, as he was
a man in the prime of life and, up to his
isr.a. nlness, in the best of health. He
had recently return d from a trip into
Ca.averas County, where he has some
mining interests, a:id while there caught
a sev re cold. Tnis developed into pneu
monia, which terminated fataJlv as re-
Jated. Mr. Fast was a native oi Ohio and
was 47 years of ace at the time of hit
deatii. He came here some three years
ago from PaliÃades, Nevada, where he
had been employed for years as paymas
ter on the Nevada Division of the Central
Pacific. His funeral will not be held until
after the arrival of his brother from the
East.
The Narrow-Gauge Hole.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April B.â The news
that the narrow-gaune mole is to be filled
in and made a solid earthwork instead of
the trestle-work which is now iv use is re
ceived with joy by Alamedans who have
to travel by that route. With a solid pier,
lighted by electricity, the accommoda
tions by that line will be the equal of any
in the State.

Bishop rules over fourteen dioces?s at the
Antipodes. He is a large man with a ruddy
face and kindly appearance.
"When I left Sydney," he said "they
wero electing dele K aies to draw up a con
stitution which was to be submitted to
the people lor a Â«reat federation. Ten
delegates were to be elected from each of
the colonies, and they were to meet on
Marcn 22 and draw up the constitution.
Afterward the people were to vote whether
they liked it or not. There was a great
deal of interest In it in New Soutn Wales.
I think federation is sure to come sooner
or later. However, I ilo not expect that
the country will sever itself from England
as an independent country."
The Bishop will only be here a few days.

Radical Change to Be Made

Adams Wharf Will in Future Be the
Center of Fruit and Produce
Business of This City.
Oakland Office Saw Francibco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 8. j
The commission merchants of this city
have taken the fir?t step toward carrying
out the plan of moving to the water front
that was outlined in The Call several
weeks ago. The first steamer has been
purchased and will be ready for service by
the Ist of May.
This steamer is the Harding, a strrn
wbee! craft of 240 tons, drawing only two
feet of water. She was built on Puget
Sound about two years ago and cost f 17,-
BART MORGAN, a Prominent Republican Politician of Oakland
Who Died Yesterday.
000, but was purchased by local parties for
a little less than $10,000. She will be
owned and operated by a local company
in which the Eleventh-street commission
men will be stockholders. With this boat
every other day shipments of fruit, ber
ries, melons, potatoes, cabbages and all
other kind^ of produce will be made di
rect from the Sacramento River orchards
and ranches without going neai San Fran
cisco.
It has been decided that it will not do to
trust to one boat every pther day, and a
second boat will soon be bought so that
fre- h produce will be placed on Oakland
wharves every morning at the same hour
that it is now placed in San Francisco.
This will avoid all the handling of the
fruit and produce consumed in Oakland
by San Francisco whartineer-i, and also
the consequent reshipmeut and handling
in crossing the bay.
The steamer will land at the new Adams
wharves east of Alice-street bridge. The
wharf-owners have not taken any stock in
the steamers, but will invest about $20,000
in putting up buildings for offices. and
warehouses for the commission men, many
of whom will at once move to the water
front.
The removal of the commission-houses
and the purchase of steam- rs by Oakland
merchants is of great significance, for it
means that all t lie produce of the cities
on this side the bay, which has hituerto
pa-sei through the hands of the San
Francisco middlemen, must be deducted
from the volume of business transacted
on San Francisco's water front.
There are large canneries on this side
the bay and all the tons of fruit which
they use daily and which is not grown in
this county has been shipped here via San
Francisco. This will now cease and it is
calculated that by the new method all the
fruit and produce will pass through the
hands of seven people less than under the
old system.
New Knilroad Work.
OAKLAND, Cal., April B.â The South
ern Pacific Railroad Company has com
menced many important change? and im
provements in its West Oakland yards.
The Peralta-street station and sheds and
platform are being removed to a point sev
eral hundred yards east and eight hun
dred feet of additional coal-bunkers are to
be built.
Work has alio commenced on a large
electric automatic scale which will regis
ter the weights of loaded cars as they pass
over it.
This electric scale is a new device. It is
arranged a little below the trrade and on
such gradients that a car will ko down a
small incline, pass over the scale, register
its weight and run up again to grade on
the other eide.
Many other improvements are to be
made in the yards, on which it Ss stated
the company will spend at least $150,000
this summer.

DEATH OF BART MORGAN.
For Nearly Half a Century He Had
Been in Business In This
State
OAKLAND, Cal., April B.â Bart Mor
gan, for many years Supervisor of this
county, who vacated his seat in 1894, died
Ifait morning. He had been gradually
sinking for a coupje of years, and finally
paralysis of The brain caused death.
For many years Mr. Morgan was a prom
inent iacior in Alumeda County politics.
His early life was passed in Lawrenceburg,
lnd., where he was born sixty-eight years
ago. His father was one of the early
setilers of tiiat territory, having gone
there in 1816. His faiher, John Morgan,
was a local preacher of the United Breth
ren sixty-three years and a Justice of
the Peace for many years. His son, Bart,
received bis e^rly education in a little log
sciioolhouse near his father's farm. In
1852 he married Miss Angeline Donnell of
Decaiur County, Ind., and aix months
later was a widower, his wife having died
of consumption.
In 1853 Mr. Morgan, anxious to leave
the scene which nad been made unpleas
ant to him on account of his young wife's
death, started for California by way oi
New York and Panama. After arriving
in Pan Francisco he decided at once to go
to Placerviile, and several years were spent
In mining in that region. In 1866 be
opened a drugstore in Georgetown, in the
mining region, and three years later he
sold out and came to ;Oakland. For some
years he served as a clerk in the assessor's
department in the Unite.l States Internal
Revenue Bureau in San Francisco. After
a few years he went to Georgetown for
another brief period, and in 1874 returned
to Oakland to live permanently.
In that year he opened a drugstore in
this city and remained in business at the
corner of Market and Seventh streets for
seventeen years. In 1871 he married
Catherine Armstrong, who died of con
sura rtion seven years later, leaving no
family.
In 1884 Mr. Morgan was nominated by
the Republicans for Supervisor. He
joined tlie party at its organization in
this State in 1855, and always took an act
ive part in Republican politics. Hisnomi
nation led to his election, and he suc
ceeded himself twice, finally going out of
office in 1894.
The deceased was a member of Uni
versity Lodge No. 144, I. O. O. F.,and will
be buried by his breihren.

RIENZI EXPLAINS
HIS POSITION
Editor Hopper Also Has
Something to Say
About Him
Retractions and Apologies of
Berkeley Students for a
Faculty Roast.
R erz and Hopp.r Each Declare That
the Published Article Didn't Re
fer to the President.
BERKELEY, Cal., April B.â "RienÂ«i"
has made an explanation of bis recent ar
ticle attacking the university and its pres
ident, which created a wide sensation.
Editor Hopper has also declared nis posi
tion, as the publisher of Kienzi's remarks.
There is nothing in the new statements
tending to establish the identity of the
unknown writer, but his productions are
generally credited to L. M. SolomonÃ '93.
"Rienzi" declares that he did not mean
to attack President Kellogg, and ex
presses "earnest regrets" that the latter
was brought into the discussion. The
anonymous writer says regarding his sen
sational philippic of two weeks ago:
The article was not an "attack" on President
Ki-llogK or any one else, but on a system. The
article concerned the future welfare of the
university, and President Kellogg was the lnst
person in my mind when I wrote it. Sooner or
later the regents will be called upon to select
President Kellogg's successor, and my remarks
on the subject had to do with that time. That
tney might, could, would or should do any
thing to hasten that time was never for a mo
mem contemplated by me, nor do I wish that
sucn a subject snould" be even suggested. Since
it has come up, I wish to emphatically declare
that I would be amoug the first to oppose such
a procedure. The university has had far too
many presidential upheavals already.
My closing assertion itiat we must, act now
had reference solely to my suggestion as to
the chairmanship of depanmeuts. I believe
that such a change is imperative now in order
to pave the way for the selection, when the
time comes, of the kind of president the uni
versity needs for it 1 * future development. I
neither said nor implied that a cnauge in the
presidency was desirable at the present mo
ment. What 1 did imply, and now repeat, is
that the university, so long as its present or
ganization is maintained, judging by i's past
end its tendencies. Is not llteiy to get ttnd
keep the kind of president it need*. We have
had able presidents, but we have not Kept
them. We have also had presidents who were
not very able. Why it should have been sup
posed that 1 placed our present hmd in the
1.-i.-t any more than in the tirst 1 cannot see.
He has not occupied his present position so
long as to warrant our saying ti.at we have
"kept" him. The lact is 1 was nol thinking
of President Kel.ogg at all.
In closing, I wish to express to President
Kellogg my sincere regret that, unwittingly,
I should have precipitated a discussion which
must have been most unpleasant to him; and
to congratulate the university on the dignity
and good sense displayed by Us head in refus
ing to discuss the subject himself. Also, I
wish to condole with the many persons who
have been suspected of being Kienzi.
Editor Hopper declares that he is re
sponsible fur whatever appears in the Occi
dent, and denies that he ever disclaimed
responsibility. He announces that be will
continue to publish "all sincere, well
written expressions of opinion," regard
less of bow- much stir they create. As to
'â¢Rieuzi's" famous production, the student
editor says: "Personalities were not
touched. It is not at all derogatory to
President Faure of France to say that,
from the nature of French government,
he is weaker than President AlcKinley."
The new articles, with toe apologies to
President Kellozg, and denial of intent to
say or publish the bard things that were
said and published, is regarded as the end
of the incident.
HAMLET IN A NEW DRESS
Tiu Prince of Denmark as
Ambroise Thomas Saw
Him.
Albers Has Woa Success in Three
Countries as the Princeâ His
Benefit To-Night.
Most good things in the dramatic and
musical line get to San Francisco sooner
or later. Ambroise Thomas' "Hamlet"
has been thirty years in reaching here,
but in compensation for this tardiness
when the opera receives its initial Cali
fornia production by the French opera
company to-night the title role will be
played by Henri Albers, who has won
fame as the Prince of Denmark in three of
the most critical of European countries â
France, Belgium and Holland.
Before Albers' time it was the fashion
to play the lyric Hamlet without much
regard for Shakespeare. The prince was
always clad in black velvet, heavily
trimmed with glittering bugles.
"This is all very well for a. troubador,
but it is not Shakespeare's Hamlet," said
Albers when he was about to make his
â lirsi appearance in the role at Antwerp.
He div not discard tradition hastily, how
ever. He studied Shakespeare's drama till
he learned it by heart, he saw, ana care
fully noted the acting of a number of
famous tragedians. Iv minor points,
when he doubted his own judgment, be
sought advice from Sir Henry Irving,
Ernest Passart ol Munich, and other
actors. The result of all this toil was a
lyric Hamlet, which is said to hold it>
own with the great Hamlets o! prose
drama.
When asked last night to give a synoD
sis of the plot.Albers said : "It was neces
sary to cut out a great deal of the dialogue
when 'Hnmlet' was made into an pera,
for if all Shakespeare's plays had beeu set
to music it would have taken from now
till to-morrow night in the performance.
I am curious to know what the San Fran
cisco public will think of the opera, in
France it is Ambroise Thomas' most pop*
ular work. The music is much grander
and more beautiful than that of 'Miguon'
or 'Songe dune Nuit d'etc' "
"Well, for operatic purposes the plot
cannot follow the drama exactly. The
opening scene of the opera iÂ» the corona
lion of Hamlet's uncle. The effect of the
music is very charming in this scene, and
there is a march that Has become so pop
ular that in Denmark it baa been adopted
as the national Danish march.
"In the second act Hamlet sees the
specter, and there are some grand phrases
iv the music of this scene. The next scene
takes place in a garden of the palace
where Hamlet meets Ophelia and is about
to speak to her when he recalls his vow of
vengeance.
"The rest of the scene between them is
in pantomime, with the orchestra tran
scrioipg what is passing in their hearts in
beautiful music
"The famous soliloquy "Etre on ne pas
etre," is Riven in the fifth act, after Ham
let's scene with his mother. The chamber
seen* ends Hamlet's role. In the sixth
act Ophelia dies, but not as in the tflay,
for she tails into the water on the stage
and sinki beneath the flowers and rashes
singing to the end."
Shot In the Hip.
Albert Murdock, a boy 18 years of age, resM-
ing at 332 Thirtieth street, was on the San
Bruno road yesterday and had a revolver to
hiÃ pocket While changing it to another
pocket it. exploded and the buliet lodged in
his hip. He was taken to the City and County
Hospital.

HAVE FOLDED THEIR TENTS
Last Day's Session of the Stat>
Sunday-Scbool Con
vention.
Import -nt Business Transacted and
Officers and Directors
E ret d.
The story of Jonah and the whale came
near disturbing a delightful calm that has
characterized the thirtieth annual con
vention of the State Sunday-school Asso
ciation. It all happened in an innocent
way, stirred the convention for a mo
ment, and then a single timely word
silenced the wranglers and the imper
turbabie cairn was restored.
Miss Helen Wright of the State Normal
School, San Jose, was responsible for the
interesting disturbance. In tier very ex
cellent paper, "Teaching the "Word," she
found occasion to say: "Teach the
prophets and tell the young people how
the prophecies are being fulfilled as the
years go by. Teach that the hand of God
is in every part of the good book. It is a
small matter, it seems to me, whether this
one or that one wrote the wholo of any
booK, or whether the story of Jonah is a
parable or the literal trut!i."
Miss Wright's address was warmly re
ceived, but the allusion to the story of
Jonah brought on even warmer discussion
of a doctrinal point.
Eventually discussion was silenced by a
brother who rose to a point of order and
declared tiiat the session was for consid
eration of methods of tea.hing, and not
for denominational wrangling.
Dr. Case came gallantly to the rescue of
Miss Wright, saying that her address was
the best he ever heard in a Sunday
school convention in his life, and he was
trying to invent some scheme together
down to the Howard-street Church.
Dr. T. H. Robinson of Centerville led
the devotional exercises at the morning
session.
E. P. Vining read an interesting paper,
"Knowing the Word. "
Rev. E. S. Chapman spoke on "Dome
the Word."
At the afternoon session Dr. W. W. Case
led the devotional exercises.
The reports of the nominating commit
tee and the resolution committee, respec
tively, were submitted.
The committee on resolutions recom
mended that a Suniay-closing movement
be made a political issue.
Voluntary contributions from the coun
try schools and individuals were received,
the whole amounting to $150.
The following officers were elected:
President, Frank H. Baft. San Jose; first
vice-president, Rev. H. N. Hoyt, Sacra
mento; second vice-president, Rev. M. M.
Gibson, San Francisco; third vice-presi

SERVICE ENJOINED.
The Bulletin and the Poat Claim the
Associated Press Has Violated
Its Contracts.
ThÂ« Evening Post has applied to the
courts for a writ to have service of the As
seciated Press news to the Daily Report
enjoined on the ground that such service
is in violation of a contract existing be
tween the Post and Bulletin on the one
hand and the Associated Press on the
other. They hold class A contracts, which
they claim entitle the subscribers to a vote
in the association and which they say
were entered into with the understanding
that competitors should not be given the
service of the Associated Press without
the consent of the proprietors of the two
papers mentioned. The Report suo
scribed to the United Press until it went
out of existence, and yesterday on appli
cation to the board of directors ol toe As
sociated Press, now in session in New
York, was given the news service of that
organization through J. P. Dunning
Western manager.
Mr. Dunning stated last evening that he
bed acted under orders in giving the Ke
port tne service of the Associated Press,
and would continue to do so unless
stopped by the courts. No papers had
been served upon him, but he had been
unofficially notified that there would be
to-day.
"Giving the Report the Associated Press
service, he said, "is not, as I understand
it, in violation of existing contracts. It is
in accord mce with the by-laws of the as
sociation, and as such distinctly under
stood by both the Post and the Bulletin.''

HAS FOUND A
MONTANA ANGEL
Mrs. Dimond Has a Backer
Who Has Money
to Burn.
Will Furnish a CDmpany and
Star Her in High Class
Vaudeville.
In the Mr a:: time the Lady Is Devel
oping Unusual Talent as a
High Kicker.
Mrs. Dimond has found an "angel."
This particular seraph, who is anxious to
singe his wings with theatrical fire, hails
from Montana, and, according to the lady,
has more millions than he can count off
on the fingers of both bis hands. But he
is not a reckless anyel and there is a limit
to his Dounty. One hundred thousand
dollars will be ventured on the Dimond
theatrical scheme and no more. But so
great is nig faitli in the Indv's talent that
he feels confident that he is going to win
back his money many times over.
Mr*. Dimond is working hard to live up
to the bright future predicted by the gen
erous man from the .Northwest. She is
devoting four hours daily to her music
and half as many to her dancing.
"I am studying under Kiralfy," the
lady explained, "and he <=ays lam making
unusual progress. I can already kick
higher than my hend. I practice in short
skirts and am gradually feeling my way
toward tiehts. Then I take a spin on my
wheel every morning not necessarily to
reduce myself, but to harden me. My
bicycle record is twenty-five miles in two
hours, and that includes four stors."
Mr?. Dimond's "angel" has a repre
sentative her* in the person of W. G.
Hunter. He spends the greater part of
his time with his superior's star and
superintends her studies. Mrs. Dimond,
before she consented to unfold her plans,
appealed to her "'friend Mr. Hunter," who
obligingly took the matter of explanation
upon himself.
"I represent the Montana millionaire,"
he complacently remarked, "and what
ever 1 say 2oeÂ«. He has more money than
he knows what to do with, and he would
just as soon drop $100,000 or so as not.
"He will put Mrs. Dimond at >he head of
a high class vaudeville company and star
her in New Yo'k late in the fall. We will
Hay all the big Eastern cities and San
Francisco can't see our star for a year.''
At present the millionaire who is so
anxious to rid himself of his surplus
wealth is spending money and picking
orange blossoms â Recording to bis repre
sentative â in Southern California.
"He may bring some of those blossoms
home for a certain lady to wear," said
Hunt6r. And then Mr-. Dimond smiled
and blushed a delightful, progressive blush
that made her fair face flush from throat
to eyebrow.
There was a faraway look in her eyes
wi.en she said : "The only fault my friend
finds with me is I'm to iuoaest; but lie
promises me I'll get over thnt."
The Montana "angel," with his orange
blossoms, is expected about Thursday of
next week.

been in this City for some weeks arrang
ing games for the team and making prepa

TO PROSECUTE MRS. COHN
Promoter of the Penny-Purchas
ing Agency to Go Before
the Courts.
Members Wbo Claim That They Were
Victimized Will Endeavor to
Rrcover Their Money.
Mrs. A. Conn, the heroine of the
"Penny Purchasing Agency," must
shortly go before the courts and explain
how she failed to redeem certain matured
contracts issued by her into the hands of
unsuspecting purchasers.
This conclusion was reached last even
ing by several hnndr?d members of the
"penny poorman's organization," as Mrs.
Cobn was wont to call her agency, who
assembled in B'nai B'rith Hall to discuss
the gravity of the situation they found ex
isting. Â«
Attorneys H. B. M. Miller and William
H. Schooler have been retained by the
members who claim they are victims of
Mrs. Conn's shrewd business ability. Mr.
Schooler, who was one of the committee
appointed to devise ways and means to
recover the money paid into Mrs. Cohn's
bands, read an opinion of the committee
containing its ideas as to the best mode of
procedure.
The committee did Dot believe that the
institution of criminal proceedings at the
present time would be profitable.
The "victims" readily acquiesced in the
opinion of the committee, but it was
understood that in case sufficient in
criminating evidence was gathered durin<*
the civil cases Mr*. Cohn would be prose
cuted in the criminal courts.
In the civil suits a number of members
whose claims upgrenate $39y will assign to
some selected member and suit will be
instigated in his name. This will be con
tinued until all members holding claims
against Mrs Cohn are before the court.
They are peers iv their professionâ binding

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 9, 1897.
AFTER BLYTHE'S
MANY MILLIONS
A Far- Reaching Attack
in the Federal
Courts.
Jeff Chandler Has Caused Od
Lawyers to Prick Up
Their Ears.
JuJge Morrow About to Say Whether
Aliens May Inherit Lands in
the United States.
Lawyers throughout the State are greatly
j interested in the legal battle now going
! on in the United States Circuit Court and
| in the Supreme Court of the United States
' over the distribution of the I>J y the mil
â  lions!
The time for the filing of briefs on some
j of the important phases of the controversy
. on behalf of the defendants will expire
in the United States Circuit Court on
! Monday, after which the plaintiffs will
| bave fifteen days for replying. It is likely
i that there will be some closely contested
j points between now and the final subinis
! sion of the case.
Though the litigation has been present
i ed in many phases the general public does
j not understand the scope and possibili
| ties of the assault which Attorneys Burke
Holladay and Jeff Chandler have made
upon Florence Blythe and all claiming
share in the property by reason of her
title.
It is alleged by the aggressors in the
present litigation that John W. Blythe of
Kentucky and Henry 1. Blythe of Arkan
sas are the only heirs of the late Thomas
Blythe. To establish their contention
they have obtained a writ of error from
tb* Supreme Court of the United States to
ti;e Supreme Coun of the State and have
begun a suit to quiei title in the United
States Circuit Court.
The position of Messrs. Holladay and
Chandler is that the power to determine
the rights of aliens is wholly a Federal
power, and that the riehtsof aliens cannot
be the subject of adjudication in State
courts.
The record in tbe Blythe case shows be
yond dispute that Florence Blythe was
born abroad, and that she is an alien whose
rights cannot be passed upon by State
courts.
"There is no treaty or Federal law per
mitting aliens to inherit lands in this coun
try,"said Mr. Chandleryesterday,"and the
; whole question is whether the State may,
I in the absence of a treaty or Federal law,
i occupy the field and pass laws. We say
that the matter is wholly beyond State
: juri>diction; that no State can thrust it
! self into this region of foreign rights or
! project its power so far as to assume juris
-1 diction over thÂ« richts of Englishmen and
other aliens. It was decided in the One
Hundredth United States Reports, in a
'â  Virginia case, that a State cannot forbid
aliens from inheriting. By parity of rea
j soniug a State cannot provide for aliens to
inherit. In other words, we contend that
j the whole question of the property rights
| ot foreigners is a matter for the United
I States courts to decide.
"If the United States courts should
aeree with us it would summarily end the
claim of Florence Blythe, for the judg
ment of the State Supreme Court would
be set aside. Our clients are the only citi
zens of tbe United States who lay claim to
the estate, and we apprehend no serious
trouble with any other heirs if we can get
Florence Blythe's title set aside."
Whatever becomes of the case it will be
important as the first one that has ever
arisen wherein the point was made. It
will therefore be of great value as a his
torical precedent.
The position of Garber, Boalt, Bishop,
Hart and others, who represent the Flor
ence Blythe cleim, is that tbe State has
the absolute right to rezulate tbe descent
of land so long as its laws are not in con
flict with the constitution of the United
States and the laws and treaties duly
made by the Government.
It is generally regarded by well-informed
lawyers that the point above outlined, as
insisted upon by Attorney Chandler, is
one of grave importance, being far-reach
ing in its consequsnces to this case as well
as to many others that may arise.

FAST NEARING
THE GALLOWS
The Supreme Court Refuses
Durrant a Writ of
Error.
3e Was Very Anxious to Take
the Case to the Highest
Tribunal.
Cairns Made Ttat the Murderer Did
Not Have d Fair anJ Im
partial Trial.
The attorneys for Durrant, the murderer
of Blanche Lamont, made another in
effectual effort yesterday to save their
client from the gahows. They petitioned
Chief Justice Beatty of the State Supreme
Court for a writ of error, in order that
they night carry the case to the Supreme
Court of the United States on appeal from
the final judgment of the Supreme Court
of California, rendered last week.
Of course, the appellant had to show
that his rights under United States laws
had not been protected. Ihe effort yester
day was to show that Durrant had not
been tried t>y a fair and impartial jury,
and that two of the City newspapers had
done much to prejudice the public in gen
eral against the defendant when he was
on trial.
The petition was based on these
grounds: That Durrant, on May 'Ji, 1895,
was arraigned in the Superior Court of
Ban Francisco on a charge of murder. On
July 8 "an alleged trial was entered upon
seeking to obtain a jury for the trial of
the petitioner. The jury was obtained
over the objections of the defendant, and
that the jury selected was not impartial,
as required by law, and that tbe mode of
trial by such a jury was in direct violation
of Article VI of the amendments to the
| constitution of the United States, wherein
I it is provided that "'ln all criminal prose
! cations the accused shall enjoy the right
I of a speedy and public trial by an impar
i tial jury of the State and district wherein
; the crime shall hare been committed,
( etc.," and also in violation of article V of
the same laws, which provides that, "No
person shall be deprived of iife, liberty or
property without due process of law."
Also that the lists of selection by the Su
perior Court of talesmen wherefrom to se
lect a jury under thÂ» provisions of section
204, C. C. P., was a direct violation of sec
tion 11, article I, of the constitution of the
State of California, and thereby a direct
violation of the provisions of article V and
article VI of the amendments to the
I United States constitution.
The petition states thnt application
j was made for a change of venue on July
| 25, at he could not secure a fair and im
| partial jury in San Francisco. This, too,
was denied, he claims, in violation of the
same amendments. On August 9 efforts
were made to have the editors of the Ex
aminer and Chronicle punished for con
tempt for publishing articles prejudicial
to the defendant, and action on this was
postponed and was never acted upon by
the court.
In referring to tbe jury the petitioner
declared that Jurors Crocker and Nathan
were not impartial, to hij iujury. In con
clusion he asks that a writ of error be
granted and that a stay of proceedings be
ordered in the case until the final determi
nation of (because.
Chief Justice. Beatty lost but little time
in considering the petition, which ha dis-
I missed in this way :
This petition for a writ ol error Is denied.
It does not appear that any rights secured to
the petitioner by the constitution or laws ol
the United States bare been denied or vio
lated, and no sucn question is presented by
the record. Beatty. C J.

It is understood that the prisoner's at
torneys have not given up the tight yet,
but propose to appeal to the United
States Supreme Court.
A IRIGHTFUL DEATH.
William Haubrink'n Skull Crushed
While Stopping a Kunawuy.
William Haubrick, engineer at the
water works in Golden Gate Park, met
with a frightful death yesterday after
noon. A team of horses attached to a
waeon filled with dirt ran away, and Mr.
Haubrick in aitemptine to stop the horses
was thrown under their feet. Before he
could extricate himself one of the wheels
passed over his head, crushing the skuli
and killing him instantly.
The deceased was "28 years old and had
been employed in the park for about
three years. His death has bereaved a
widow and two children.
Mine. Soldene Has Keturned.
Mme. Emily Soldene, the opera-singer, who
is well known in Ban Francisco, where she ap
peared and sang on different occasions years
?.i?o, was among the arrivals on the Monowai
yesterday. She was in Europe for some time
prior to going to the Antipodes. Mme. Soldene
is the author of a book on tne Engligh nobility
that she has met which attracted great atten
tion in some quarters. She has also com
mented quite freely on some of the million
aires of San Francisco.
Illegal Fishing.

BOUGHT THE
TOMBOY MINE
Close of a Two Million
Dollar Deal in This
City.
President William Bailey and 0.
P. Pcsey Formally Transfer
51 Per Cent of Stock.
Mr. Posey Says He and His Partner
May Now Invest in the Mines
of Th s State
President William Bailey and General
Manager O. P. Posey of the famous Tom
boy mine, Telluride, Colo., have arrived
here to formally transfer the mine to the
London Exploration Company, and are at
the Palace.
The Tomboy ig one of the great gold
properties of the West, and one oi the
newer ones. Messrs. Posey and Bailey
bought it about four years ago, when it
was merely a good prospect, a company
was organized' Mr. Bailey toot the presi
dency and Mr. Posey the direct manage
tnent. Under Mr. Posey' s supervision the
Tomboy speedily became a remarkable
producer and its name was one to conjure
with.
Its fame spread abroad and Henry
Bratnober, through instructions from the
London Exploration Company, began to
negotiate Beripusly for the property. The
result was that a purchase was made, and
yesterday the deal was finally closed by
the payment of the money. Mr. Posey
and Mr. bailey met Mr. Mortson, the ex
pert for the Exploration Company; A.
Wortenweiler and others early in the day.
in the evening Mr. Bratnober ana Thomat
Mem arrived.
The sale is one of the biggest, and in all
respects one of the most important that
has taken place in the West for a long
time. The whole of the mine is not sold,
but the controlling interest. The property
is to be worked steadily.
The exploration company has hitherto
bought the Treadwell, the Mexican and
Alaska United mines in Alaska, the Lucky
Boy in Oregon, the Oneicia in Amador
County, ihe Anaconda copper mines in
Montana and properties in Sonora and
New Mexico. It is picking up great mines
wherever it can over the country. It owns
in South Africa, Australia and South
America â wherever, in fact, it can get
something good at a figure that promises
to be proiitable.
Mr. Posey said in regard to the visit of
himself and associate:
"We have come here to formally trans
fer the Tomboy. The agreement :o tell
was made some time ago, when Mr. Brat
nober and Hamilton Smith came to Tellu
ride and examined the mine. Mr. Smith
did not come on to California, but re
turned to London.
"We are selling 51 per cent of the stock
on the basis of $2,000, 000 valuation of the
mine. It is the Rothscuilds wbo are the
heavy men in the company. They are
baying property all over. We heard of
them and encouraged negotiating.
"They would rather buy a part of a
mine in this country than buy it all for
this reason: They have got pretty badly
cinched in sorr.e places by large taxes and
many other waya â there are a dozen ways
of doing it â and they rind if the people
here are in with them their interests are
protected. For a long time they owned
ie-s than half the stock in the Anaconda
for this reason.
â¢â¢The Tomboy is producing now abont
$100,000 a month, of which $70,000 to $75,
--OUO is net protit. About 200 men are being
employed. The ore is free milling. We
have instead of stamps eight Huntington
crushers, and all housed in such a way as
to make one of the best equipped mines in
tbe West.
"Oar object now is to turn the property
over. Whether 1 ana Mr. Bailey will in
vest in mines in California now is some
thing we hare not decided on hilly yet.
Of course we are going to continue to
mine. That is our business. Our fami
lies are now in Los Angeles. We may be
come interested in some mines before
long."
A LESSON IN ART.
Exquisite Taste Manifested In
Raphael's Easter Window
Decoration.
No other proof is necessary to establish the
art-loving tendencies of the inhabitants of the
City than the constantly moving throng that
crowded about Raphael's handsomely deco
rated Easter window yesterday. Men, women
and children stopped and gazed and wondered
at the enchanting results achieved by the
skillful decorator.
In the middle of the vast windows is a mini
ature chariot fashioned of a mammoth Easter
egÂ«r. A snow-white goat with silver trappings
is harnessed to the equipage which seems in
the very act of rolling away to fairy land on
its rainbow-hued spangled silver wheels.
Garlands of deep purple pansles cling lov
ingly round the body of the miniature car
riage. The effect of the whole is as strikingly
beautiful as it is appropriate to the approach
ing joyous Eastertide.
Art and enterprise for once are harmoniously
joined and the handsome figures displaying
the latest Easter fashions, instead of detract
ing, on the contrary ndd to the beauty of the
central figure. Mr. Raphael, who has done
many things for which San Francisco is justly
proud and grateful, is to be congratulated on
this, his last and greatest achievement.
