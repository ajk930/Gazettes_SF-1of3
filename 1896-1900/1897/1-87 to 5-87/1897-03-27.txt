iiONDON. Eng., March 26.â The Tele
graph wi.l to-morrow publish a dispatch
from Vienna stating that all the powers
have now accepted ttie project to blockade
theentire Greek coast, bpginnin* with the
ports of i he Piraeus, Volo, CorinWi aud
Ana.
The Government announces that the
international forces in Crete have occu
pied the town of Malaxa. tbe scene of the
fighting between the Turkish parrison
and lhe Cretan insurgents yesterday. The
grounds for this action are t.ai the ad
mirals commanding the join' fleet of the
powers rt-ganied thai the occupation oi
the town l>y either the Turks or Greeks as
menacing to the European powers oc
cupying Canea.
The Canea correspondent of the Times
telegraphs that many complaints are
heard of the partiality shown by the pow
ers for the Turks. He adds that Moham
medans have burned part of the village of
Periovolia. Animals belonging to the
Turks are feeding upon the vines of Chris
tians. The Church of St. John has just
ben desecrated by a crowd "of Moslems, j
All these things are, bein?; done undÂ«r the

who make no effort to stay them. The
Mohammedans think that now they have
'European backing they can do what they,

Tlie dispatch adds that the 'fleets at 2
o'clock this afternoon resumed their shell
ing of the Christian insurgents in the vi
cinity of Canea.
CANEA, Crete, M^rch 26.â Chris
tian sympathizers here caustically com
ment upon the action of the powers in
taking possession of the town ot Malaxa
on the ground that the foreign admirals
bold that its occupation by either Chris
tians or Turks is aan^ero.us to the Euro
peans in this city. -The fact of the <ian
perousness of the position, it is pointed
out, only impressed the admirals fter
the Christians had compelled the Turkish
garrison to evacuate and had captured the
place. So long as the Turks held posses
sion no danger wai apparent to the ad
miral?, but once the Christians "com
manded the position the foreign - naval
otficers wakened to a vary lively sens* of
.the risk that was being run by their sea
â¢ men and marines and the international
troops ashore. Malaxa is one of the
places that command the iandward, ap

strong strategic position in the event of
an attack being made upon the town, but
it is not generally believed, except by ihe
more timorous Turks, and perhaps the
foreien admirals, that the insurgents
meditate an attack upon this city. If the
Turks had been able to hold the place
there would have been no action taken by
the admirals to seize it.
The practical wiping out of the Malaxa
! garrison on its retreat toward the coast
i towns has caused a leelinjr of uneasiness
! among the garrisons stationed in other
i forts. Tlie insurgents pursued and de

PARIS, Frame, March 26 âLord Salis
bury, here on hi 3 way to Cimiez to attend
Queen Victoria, had a conference with M.
Hanotaux, Minister of Fureiuu Affairs, to
day. It is understood that the two Minis
ter- agreed that the propose*! blockade of
Athens should be enforced if Greece re
fused to assent to the establishment of a

neutral zone extending one mile either
side of the Greek-Turkish frontier.
M. rianotaux later returned Lord Salis
bury's visit, calling upon him at the Brit
ish Embassy. They were closeted to
gether for an hour. Lord Salisbury left
Paris at 8:oO o'clock to-night aud pro
ceeded for Nice.
Efforts were made after th<? departure of
Lor J Salisbury to learn from M. Hanotaux
the topics that had been discussed by the
two statesmen. When questioned on the
subject M iiatiotaux smilingly gave a
diplomatic ainw. r, saying that the Brit
ish Prime Minister was a good French
scholar and had expressed hit views in
the clearest manner. M. Hanotaux, how
ever, declined to state what these views
were. There in no doubt in the public
mind that the question of the action to be
taken by France and Great Britain in the
Cretan imbrotriio wns thoroughly dis
cussed, and that some definite under
standing was arrived at.
ATHENS, Greece, March 26.â The Gov
ernment has handed to the representa
tives here of the several powers a note
protesting against the blockade of Crete.
The note declares that in view of the
bonds uniting the Greeks and the Chris
tians of Crete, the blockade which is
depriving the island of the means of pro
visioning itself is contrary to the senti
ments of humanity inspiring the powers.
The president of the Boule, in behalf of
that body, has sent to Mr. Gladstone a
message of gratitude for the stand he has
taken in behalf of Greece and the Cretan
Christians. The message says in part:
"All your glorious life has been full of
combats for justice and liberty. Now
that the Hellenic nation has risen to light
in favor of Crete which is bedewed with
blood, you come to uphold anew the
rights of an oppressed race."
For some as yet unexplained reason
Crown Prince Cosistantine, who it was an
nounced last night would leave Athens at
4 o'clock this morning to assume com
mand of tha Greek forces in Thessaly, has
not yet left this city. Jr is now reported
that he will Â»Â»o.to the Piraeus, whence he
will sail for Volo, in Thessaly, to-morrow
evening.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 26 -One
hundred ana tidy sturdy young Greeks,
after bidding an afftciionate farewell to
friends and countrymen, ai It o'clock to
night marched aboard the French Line
steamer La Champagne, ana at 5 o'clock
to-morrow morning will start for Greece,
where they will offer their services to
King George. With porhaps a dozen ex
ceptions all have served in the Greek
army, a score or more having been offi
cers. Nearly all are naturalized Ameri
can citizsns.
McKINLEY WILL NOT SPEAK.
Refusal of the President to Take Any
Part in the Red-Hot Municipal Cam
paign at Ch.cago.
CHICAGO. 111., March 26.â The influ
ence of t:.e National administration will
not be brought to bear in any public man
ner upon the present municipal cam
paign, although Preskiont McKinley has
been importuned by Republican leaders
to make a speech in Chicago before tha
election or to write a letter indorsing the
Republican candidates. In the matter of
candiJates the campaign is one of the
most remarkablo on record. The Repub
lican nominee for Mayor is Judge Sears
of the Circuit bench, who owes his prom
inence entirely to the machine leaders.
The choice of the Free Silver Democrats
and Populists is Carter H. Harrison, son
and namesake of Chicago's murdered
Mayor.
The G6ld Democrats have no nominee,
but there is an Independent Republican
candidate In the person of Alderman John
N. Marian, son of Justice riarlan of the
Supreme Court, and an Independent
Democratic condidate iv the person of
Postmaster Washington Hesing, whose
whiskers *lone have made him Nationally
famous. Harlan's campaign is directed
entirely aiainst the boocilers, who have
overwhelming control of the City Council,
and ignores all other issues. Harrison is
again-t tne continuance of civil service,
and in favor of wide-open saloons, gam
bling-house* and poolrooms; or, as he
himself puts it, "in favor of throwing
Chicago wide open."
Postmaster Hesmg is also opposed to
onerous restrictions on the saloons. The
Republicans Lave endeavored to inject
the tariff and gold-standard issues into
the campaign, and members of Congress
have been brought on here from Washing- .
ton to urge the election of Judge Sears, on
ihe ground that his defeat in a city which
cave so overwhelming a Republican ma
jority last November would mean the re
pudiation of the Dingley tariff bill, and
incidertally indicate that Chicago had
gone back on her stand for "sound
money."
These arguments, however, have had
but little weight, and the announcement
that President McKinley will neither
come here to speak during the campaign
nor write a letter of inaorsement is re
gardea as an indication that the chief
executive takes no stock in the effort to
give a National significance to a local
election, especially when that significance
affects his own administration.

HUNTINGTON THROWS
DOWN THE GAUNTLET
The Railroad Magnate Is
Here and May Soon
"Strike Back."
HAS NOT COME -HOME"
FOR TROUBLE
"I Will Be the Next President of
the Southern Pacific," Says
He, "Come What May."
"I will be the next president of the
Southern Pacific, come what may. I
h:tvÂ«> been doing business with my asso
ciates for thirty-flve years. I made the
men who onpoae me. I have no per
sonal quarrel with Mr. Crocker. lam
not looking for trouble. 1 have come
here for health, but I am not too old yet
to strike back at the man who opposes
me. "
This is the bold challenge that Collis P.
Huntingdon uttered last night as he sat
comfortably ensconced in a chair in the
library in the Colton mansion on the
northeast orner of California and Taylor
streets, which he will hereafter call and
in reality make his home.
"1 like the people of California. lam
getting i-ld, and I am coining borne,"
He was speafcing of not having been to
this City since a year ago last November,
and, in the touching language quoted,
signified his intention of making San
Francisco his future home.
It has not been forgotten tbat at the
election for officers, held by tne directors
of the Southern Pacific Company a year
ago, oppositio i to the re-election of Hnnt
ington as president was manifested by
Mrs. Stanford in a most positive manner.
She had instructed her two representa-
tives â Russell J. Wilson and Charles
Lathrop â to vote against him, and they
dul so.
Will H. Crocker showed his opposition
in a less marked but not less significant
way ; he refused to vote at all.
The man whom Mrs. Stanford was then
desirous of seeing succeed to the honor
wnich her hiibband had held for so many
years was General Thomas H. Hubbard,
one of the representatives of the Searie3
estate.
Since this event it has apparently come
to the knowledge' of Huntington that
Colonel Charles F. Crocker has aspira
tions that would lead him, in all proba
bility, to enter the fight for the presidency
of tÂ»:e road at the coming election, which
is to be held on April 7. And this it was
that induced him to give vent to ttie de
fiant utterance which opens this article.
His boast that he will succeed himself,
"come what may," is probably made on
good grounds. There are ten directors to
be chosen at the coming election, and
these in turn elect the officers. All of the
present directors are almost certain to be
elected. Since tun last election, A. L.
Tubbs, a stanch Hunti.ngton supporter,
has passed away, but tle Tubbs estate
will be represented on the new board of
directors, it is admitted, by a gentleman
who continues as loyal to Huntington as
was Tubbs himself. This will give him
his own vote, that of his nephew, the two
votes of the Searles representatives â Gen
eral Thomas H. Hubbard and Thomas
Stillman â the vote of tbe Tubbs' repre
sentative and in all probability also that

of N. T. Smith. Against him may be th
four votes of Charles F. Crocker. Will H.
CrocKer, Russell J. Wilson and Charles
Lathrop.
The Huntington party, which had
crossed the continent in a special train,
arrived on this side of the bay at 1:15
p. m. The magnate ignored all thoughts
of business, and at once proceeded to his
home on Nob Hill, where he remained
most of the afternoon and evening, sur
rounded by his business associates and
old-time friends.
He appeared to be- in his usual robust
health, despite the intimation which ha
threw out that h>* had come to California
for his health, and showed all his old-tima
vigor of mind and body.
After he had relieved himself of the
sentiments that weighed most heavily on
his mind he turned ;o other matters.
"O; course," he remarked, "in timing
my coming I had some regard for the fact
that by making the trip now I could be
present at the annual meeting." At the
time of the meet'ng last year, when Mrs.
Stanford's unexpected opposition mani
fested itse'f, President huntington was
absent in the East. The meeting thw year
will probably prove one of the most excit
ing in the history of the great corporation.
Referring to tne recent decision of the
Supreme Court declaring illegal all rail
road associations which had for their ob
ject the maintenance of rates and the ap
portioning of traffic, he said:
"I see that the decision has provoked a
good deal of lalic and much conjecture as
to what will be its effects upon the vari
ous traffic associations and the business of
the roads generally, i don't think,
though, that there is any cause for excite
ment or alarm over the matter. It is not
my belief that tne decision necessarily
means the disruption of all the associa
tions, even though the trans-Missouri has
been declared illegal. In any case, be
cause a certain method of accomplishing
desired and necessary results is found to
be improper, it does not follow that the
same things cannot be otherwise brought
about.
"W: at I mean is that it is absurd to gay
that because of this decision all proper
concertof action among the various lines of
road must necessarily be at once done
away with and a reign of ruinous compe
tition ensue. Some way, some proper
and legal way, will certainly bo found to
prevent anything of the kind and to en
able the roads to do business on business
principles, in default of which, not they
alone, but, ultimately, at least, the travel
ing and shipping public would be the suf
ferers. It has always been my experience
that troubles such aa these right them
selves, tho necessary solution in dus time
suggesting itself.
"I certaiuly feel very positive on the
point that the 'ruinous competition*
which has beon spoken of is not going to
come to pass, for there certainly is one
very good reason why all tbe companies
interested should do nothing tending to
Mich an end. This is that none of them
have any money to throw away on this or
any other fooiisn proposition. We have
not, and I fancy we are better off than the
other*, since our company, as you know,
is just about tbe only one which has not
failed once or twice.
"At present I look iorward to the futura
of the Southern Pacific with a good deal of
confidence. In other word*, I .think wa
may claim to be reasonably prosperous,
all things considered, and I hope that
conditions may continue to improve from
now on for the general public as well as
for ourselves. The prosperity of carrying
companies, as any one should be able to
see, depends on that of the communities
with which they are identified in busi
ness."
Speaking of the completion of the coast
line from this City to Los Angeles, which
is to be eventually made the main line for
the Southern Pacific Railroad trains, he2
declared the gap between Surf and Ell
wood would be closed within the year.
In reference to a new steel ferry steamer
for service oa the bay, he said: "That is
one of the matters to be considered, and
very probably something to this end may
be determined on. We have already had
a cood deal of talk at one time and another
on the question, there seeming to be quite
a strong impression among our officials
that another boat could bs used to advan
tage in our ferry business. However, this
is but one of many matters of business
upon whicn we are to consult and decide."
He confirmed the published reports of
the proposed exchange of railroad prop
erties with tne Saiita Fe, whereby the lat
ter would come into absolute possession of
the tracks between The Needles and Mo
jave and tbe Southern Pacific Company
would acquire a section of road in Mexico
owned by the Santa Fe people aud which
would give the Southern Pacific Company
a througu line of it< own in that country,
with a terminus at Guaymas.
In conclusion he said the policy of the
company would be to do everything pos
sible for the development of California and
her industries.
GENERAL RUGER'S RETIREMENT.
It Will Cause a Promo/on A/1 Along the
Line â Brigadiers Who Are Mentioned
lor Elevation.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 2(5 âThe
retirement of Major-General Thomas H.
Ruger, which will occur April 2, will be
the most important change of the year in
military circles. Promotion all along the
line will be the result. The retiiement
will me&n the removal of Major-General
Wesley Merriu from Chicago to New
York. The War Department precedent
has it that the tecond officer of the army
shall be in comiuand of the Department of
tho East. Who will succeed Genera! Mer
ritt as commander of the Department of
the Missouri is an open question. The
appointment will be made by President
McKiniey. From tho six brigadier-gen
erals now in command of the other depart
ments the President will make his selec
tion. These are: John R. Brooke, sta
tioned at St. Paul: Frank Wbeatou,
stationed at Denver; Ed wel 1 S. Otis, sta
tioned at Vancouver; James W. Forsyth,
with headquarters at ban Francisco;
Zenas R. Bliss, stationed at San Antonio,
and Jonn J. Coppinger, stationed at
Omaha.
While precedent favors promotion of
the senior brigadier, who is General
Brooke, it by no means foiiows as certain
that he will be appointed. There is a bare
possibility that President JlcKuiley may
not Droruote General Brooke at once. It
has been suggested that as General Whea
ton is to be retired on May 8 the President
may appoint him to the vacaucy, in order
ttiat he may draw a larger salary when
retired. The pay of a major-general on
the acÂ«ive list is $7500 and a brigadier
$5500. When retired ihe major-general
pets $5625 and the brigaJier $4125. When
the promotion is m.^ie oi one of the briga
diers tc be major-general it means a tur
ther Dromoiion all along the line. One
of the colonels will become brigadier-gen
eral. Of these ihere are seventy-one. The
ranking colonel is William R. Shatter,
who commands the First Infantry.
It is not unlikely that the man chosen
â will be Colonel James E. Wade of the
Fifth Cavalry, who is the ranking cavalry
officer. Colonel Wade is an Obioan, a son
of the famous Senator Ben Wade. Re
tirements such as General Ruger's are not
sought by officers. They are compulsoiy,
aud come rattier narJ on men in active
life and good health who are perfectly
willing to remain in harness for several
years to come.
General Ruger was born April 2, 1833, at
Lima, N. Y.~ and graduated in 1854 at
West Point. For six years he was a law
yer at Janesviile, Wis. He went to the
war in IS6I as lieutenant-colonel of the
Third Wisconsin Infantry. His war rec
ord is good. He saw service in the Shen
endoan Valley and in the Northern Vir
ginia and Maryland campaigns.
For bravery at Gettysburg he was made
brevet brigadier-generai. He did duty
during the dra;t riots in New York, and
later was with Sherman at Atlanta. At
Franklin he defeated General Hood and
took part in the surrender of General J.
E. Johnston, in April, 1865. He was Pro
visional Governor of Georgia from Janu
ary 12 to July 7, 1868, and commanded
the district of Alabama and the Depart
ment of the South till 1371, when he be
came superintendent of the West Point
Academy. After five years he returned to
ihe army. He has commanded in the
South, Montana, Missouri, Dakota and
the Pacific Slor*- When General Miles
went to New York General Ruger was
made a major-general.

RAILROAD MEN
NOT IN ACCORD
Legal Lights of the West
Differ From Eastern
Opinion.
Chicago Magnates Believe That
All Associations Are
Outiawsd.
Already the Rate-Cutting Is On and
the Traveling Public May
Reap tbe Benefi .
CHICAGO, Ir.L., March 26.â A confer
ence of thele.al representatives of Chi
cago railroads was held to-day in the
office of George R. Peck, general counsel
of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul
Railroad. B. F. Ayer, general counsel for
the Illinois Central, presided, and there
was a full attendance of lawyers from the
important lines west, south and north of
Chicago. The conference was called on
account of the Supremo Court's decision
adverse to railroad traffic associations.
The prevailing sentiment of those present
showed that the Western railroad lawyers
are practically a unit in the opinion that
the Eastern railroad lawyers and joint
traffic association magnates are wrong
from a legal standpoint in assuming that
the decision does not place the stamp of
illegality on any other association except
the Trans-Missouri Freig&t Association.
The lawyors declared unanimously that
the decision outlawed such associations as
the Western Freight Association, and the
result of the conference will be that such
roadi as have not already formally with
drawn from thÂ»t organization will forth
with send notices to that effect.
The relation of the decision to passen
ger associations was not discussed suffi
ciently for a general opinion to be given
out, and each road for the present will be
guided by its own lawyers.
The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific
and the Sioux City and Northern, the lat
ter road running between Minneapolis
and O'Neill, Nebr., sent notices of with
drawp.l to-day from all traffic associations.
The Western Freight Association has
practically ceased to exist, many em
ployes having already been discharged for
lack of work to do and those of higher
grade are seeking positions elsewhere.
Most of the officials have contracts which
run to 1898, including Commissioner
Midgeley, wno is now in thÂ« Holy Land on
a sick ie jve of absence.
The disagreement of transcontinental
roads as to the payment of commissions
is supposed to have received independent
action by the Union Pacific, which may
tie the beginning of a serious rate trouble
in the absence of a transcontinpntal
agreement, except on paper. The Union
Pacific is said to have raised commissions
over its lines from the Missouri Rivet to
Denver $2, ana to California points $3.
The Ciiicago-Sr. Paul passenger situa
tion is also reported to be in a condition
bordering on c llapse in rates. The Su
preme Court decision has had the effect of
abbrogating tbe agreement of the Trans
continental Passenger Association to rool
tbe business for the Christian Endeavor
convention, to be held in San Francisco
next July, and there is danger now of a
free-fur-all bid for the business by each
line, which might bring rates from
Chicago and return down to $20.
STANFORD'S TRACK ATHLETES.
Candidates for Places on the University
Team Will Be Given a Trial
To- Day.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
March 26.â A trial field day will be held
here to-morrow. The members of the
track team have remained at college dur
ing vacation and are anxious to see what
a week's faithful training, when freed
from the cares of study, has done for
them.
The 200-yard sprint, although conceded
to Brunton, who has done it in 10 seconds
flat, gives promise of being a very inter
esting event because of the number of
men trying for places. Birch, who entered
college with a good record, was at first a
trifle disappointing, being slow in the
start. He is now much quicker in getting
off the mark and straightens up to his
work well. Captain Dale and Holbrook
have also made good showings and will
have a try at this event.
Brady Burneite as a distance man
promis s to become a worthy successor to
Dave Brown, who is now nisqualified,
having contested in four held da vs against
Berkeley. In fact, be exhibits the salient
traits of the Western runner â speed, grit
and generalship. He It now handicapped
by ten pounds of superfluous flesh. Smith,
Daggett and Walker are also showing up
well.
Morgan is doing excellent work in the
hurdles. Ha has a peculiar but grace! ul
style, has had much experience and is
Stanford's fastest man. Dole, Wilson,
P pc and Edwards are also devoting much
time to both events in the hurdles.
Captain Dole is rapidly acquiring his old
form in the high jump and is conscien
tiously practicing tlie pole vault.
Kerrigan, although unable to contest
this year, is training faithfully. In the
event of an Eastern trip be will be a valu
able addition to the team. Besides holding
the coast record of 6 feet 3 inches for the
high jump he is strong in the pole vault
and tliÂ« broad jumn. Bovd is doing good
work in the higu jump, pole vault and the
hundred.
Great interest is manifested in the mile
walk, but as yet our power in this event is
an unknown quantity.

"THE UMTJSI> WHEEIjMEy."

BALTIMORE, Md., March 26. âWith ref
erence to a report that the Minneapolis
and St. Paul wheelmen would withdraw
their support from the L. A. W., Albert
Mott, chairman of the L. A. W. Racing
Bonrd, said:
"The United W T heelmen will have a
more brief and precarious existence than
even the Knights of the Wheel of Detroit
had a few years ago. The grievances of
the United Wheelmen are based upon tbe
racing interes's of the L. A. W., which
affect comparatively few members, whiie
tbe Knights of the Wheel movement was
a direct split from the L. A. W. by promi
nent officials of the L. A. W. With that
great advantage and with numbers far ex
ceeding that of tbe Minneapolis move
ment, the Detroit affair was so insignifi
cant to the L. A. W. that its existence was
only known by an occasional and stray
newspaper paragraph.
"The affair at Minneapolis is not new.
The same parties have been struggling for
several years in the throes of rebellion,
but as they are in the aggregate a few
malcontent local racing men and their
followers, the dignity of the revolution is
much dwarfed in the public eye and the
public pulse will not respond very flatter
ingly."

JUSTICE WHITE'S
DISSENTING VIEWS
Differs From Other Mem
bers of the Federal
Supreme Court
Cites Acts of Congress to Show
Interstate Commerce Laws
Are Valid.
Some Crumbs of Cmfort for the
Rai road Associations Demoral
ize 1 by (be Recent Ru in?*
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 26.â The
dissenting opinion of Justice White of
the Supreme Court of the United States in
the Trans-Missouri Freight Association
case, wherein the majority of the conrt
decided Monday last that the anti-trust
law of 1890 was valid and constitutional
and the agreement of the association was
in restraint of trade and, therefore, in
violation -of its provisions, and in which
Justices Field, Gray and Shiras joined,
has been made public in full. It is nearly
as voluminous as the opinion delivered by
Justice Peckham, and traverses the argu
ments and conclusions of that document
in a vigorous way. Introducing the mut
ter, Justice White says:
The theory upon which the contract Is held
to be illegal is that, even though it be reason
able and hence valid under the general
principles of law, it is yet void, because it con
flicts with the act cf Congress. Now, at the
outset it is necessary to understand the full
import oi this conclusion. As It Is conceded
thai the contract does not unreasonably re
strain trade, and that if it does not so un
reasonably restrain trade it is valid under the
general law, the decision is substantially that
the act of Congress is a departure from the
general principles of law, and by its terms
destroys the rights of individuals or corpora
tious to enter into very many reasonable
contracts. But this proposition, I deem it, is
tantamount to an assertion that the act of
Congress is itself unreasonable.
The difficulty of meeting, by reasoning, a
premise oi this nature is frankly conceded, for,
of course, where the fundamental proposition
upon which the whole contention rests Is that
the act of Congress Is unreasonable, it would
seem conducive to nouseful purpose to invoke
reason as applicable to and as controlling the
construction of a statute which is admitted to
be beyond the pale of reason. The question
then is, is the act of Congress relied on to be
so interpreted as to give it a reasonable mean
ing or is it to be construed as being unrea
sonable and as violatlve of the elementary
principles oi justice?
The opinion discusses this question in
the light of former decisions as to reason
able and unreasonable agreements in
restraint of trade, and on that point the
conclusion is reached :
That to define, then, the words "In restraint
of trade" as embracing every contract which
in any degree produced that effect would be
violative of reason, becauso it would include
all those contracts which are the very essence
of trade, and would be equivalent to saying
that ttiere shou d be no trade, and therefore
nothin.K to restrain.
The principles of proper construction
are reviewed by the Justice, and he says:
If these obvious rules of interpretation be
applied it seems lv me they render it impossi
ble to construe the words "every restraint oi
trade" used io the act in any other sense than
as excluding reasons t^t. contracts, as the fact |
tint; such contracts were not cousidered to be
within the rule of contracts in restraint of
trade was thoroughly established both in
England and in this country at the time the
act was adopted.
It is, I submit, not to be doubted that the in
terpretation of the words "every contract in
restraint of trade," so as to embrace within
its purview every contrast, how eÂ» er reasona
ble, would certainly work an enormous injus
tice and oocrate to the undue restraint cf the
11 Denies of the citiz.-n. But th-rc is no canon
of interpretation which requires that the
letter be followed when by so doing an un
reasonable r Milt is accomplished. On the
contrary the rule is the other way, and exacts
that the spirit which vivifies and not the
letter which kilieth is the proper guide by
which to correctly interpret a statute. â¢ â¢ â¢
The remedy intended to be accomplished by
the act of Congress was to shield' against the
danger of contract or combination by the few
again*, the interest of the many and to the
detriment of freedom. The construction now
given, I think, strikes down the interest of the
many to ttie advantage and boncfit of the few.
It bas been held in a case involving a com
bination among worktngmen that sucn com
binations are em braced in tbe act of Congress
In question, and this view was not doubted by
this court. Tho interpretation of tlie statute,
therefore, wnich holds that reasonable agree
ments are within its purview makes it embrace
every peaceable organization or combination
of the laborer to benefit his condition either
by obtaining an increase of wages or diminu
tion of the hour.-, of labor.
It follows that the construction which reads
the rule of reason out of the statute embraces
within its inhibition every contract or combi
nation by which workiugmen seeic to peace
abiy bet.er their condition. It is, therefore,
as I see it, absolutely true to say that the con
struction now adopted which works out such
results not only frustrates the plain purpose
Intended to be accomplished by Congress, but
it also makes the statute tend to an end never
contemplated, and agninst the accomplish
ment of which Its provisions were enacted.
Justice White also discusses the ques
tion, "Does the implication irresistibly
arise that Congress intended in the act of
1890 to abrogate in whole or in part the
provisions of the act of 1887 regulating
interstate commerce?" and concludes
"That the nature of the two enactments
clearly demonstrates there was no such
intention." '
A consideration of terms of the inter
state commerce act makes it clear to him
"â .hat the contract here sought to be
avoided as ilie-nl is either directly sanc
tioned or impliedly authorized thereby. .
The agreement in question, seeking to
secure uniform classification and to pre
vent the under cutting of the published
rates, even though such agreements be
made with competing as well as with
joint lines, is in accord with the plain
text of the interstate commerce act and is
in harmony wish the views of the purposes
of that law contemporaneously expressed
in Congress by the body immediately
charged with its administration, ana
tacitly approved by Congress. â¢ * *
To my mind the judicial declaration
that carriers cannot agree among them
selves for the purpose of aiding in the en
forcement of the provisions of the inter
state commerce law will strike a blow at
the beneficial results of that act and will
have a direct tendency to produce the
preferences and discriminations which it
was one of the main objects of the act to
frustrate."
And in conclusion the minority says:
'â Manifestly this decision is utterly irÂ«
reconcilla.ble with the views that in the
case of a railroad company every restraint
imposed by contract upon its freedom of
action is necessarily injurious to the pub
lic interests, and hence invalid. Indeed,
the proposition that any restraint of its
conduct which a railroad may create by
contract is invalid because such a road is
a t Ã¼blic corporation is demonstrated to
be erroneous by the interstate commerce
act, which in the provision* heretofore re
ferred to not only expressly authorizes
but in some instances commands agree
ments, from which restraint of the action
of corporation necessarily arises."

As a Result of the Controversy of the

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 26.â The
Chinese Minister gave a dinner to-night
to several members of the Cabinet and
others. J. C. Campbell of San Francisco,

See Yup and Sam Ynp controversy and
settlement it is announced positively that
the Chinese Consul at San Francisco
Fung Yung Hang, and Vice-Consul King
will be deposed by the Chinese Govern
ment on recommendation of the Minister.
A curious story is told here in connec
tion with the See-Yup Sam Yup contro
versy. Yang Yu it is said, favored tbe
Sam Yups until the butler in the Chinese
legation, who is a See Yup, explained
affairs to Mrs. Yang Yu, the minister's
wife, who in turn interceded with her liege
lord in behalf of the See Yups. Several
of the merchants of the See Yup Company
who are now in Washington vouch for the
correctness of this story.

he had obtained a printed copy of the cir

Senator, Uo ot Favor m , Amendment"
to Ihn Treat]/.
WASHINGTON, D. c. March 26.-The
debate on the genera! treaty of arbitration
is losing ground among the Senators and
much less time than formerly is devoted
to its attention. This afternoon Gray (D.)
of Delaware spo ke in opposition to the
Cnilton amendment, which for days has
been under discussion. Senator Gray
favors the treaty as negotiated ,by Mr.
Olney. The committee amendments,
Gray hold v cover the same genera
ground soueht to be covered by Chiiton
and the substitution of his modifying
clause to the effect that nothing should
be submitted to arbitration but such mat
ters as the Senate may agree to arbitrate
is confusing and only tends to incumber
the treaty.
Senator Thurston advocated the adop
tion of the amendments reported to the
Senate during the last session, and partic
ularly that to the first article relative to
the scope of the treaty which eliminated
ail questions relating to the foreign or do
mestic policy of either of the contracting
parties. f
During the course of the debate it was
suggested that perhaps it would be best
after . all to return to- the dan suggested
by Lord Salisbury and submit to arbitra
tion only matters involving the question
of pecuniary .damage?. This - suggestion
was declined By Secretary Olney.
During the debate in secret session the
question of the committee vacancies came
up. It was caused by a criticism of Allen
(Pop.) of Nebraska, objecting to the Com
mittee on Postofrices and Post Roads con
sidering postofnea nominations until tr>^v
vacancies were rilled. V^T
As the committee now stands there uT
not a Democratic Senator on it, Butler'
(Pop.) of North Carolina being the only
Senator opposed to the Republicans.
Allen said that .this was not a fair rep
resentation, as they ' insisted that they
were unwilling to be charged with the re
sponsibility of legislation unless the Sen
ate gave them a majority of straight Re
publicans on ail committees. -
The Democrats insisted^that they could
name Democrats for those whose terms
had expired and that the Republicans
should keep the bolting Republicans now
on the committee as a part of the Repub
lican representation. . In the discussion
the Republican leaders insisted that they
must be given a clear majority or that all
the elements opposed to the straight Re
publicans com bine and take the committee
themselves. No conclusion was reached,
either upon this matter or the treaty, and
at 4 o'clock the Senate adjourned. .TARIFFS
AND THE
TRUSTS
Lively Political Arguments
Crop Up in the
House.
DEMOCRATS TRYING TO
OBSTRUCT THE BILL.
An Attempt to Strike Out the
Enacting Clause in the
New Measure.
BOURBONS DECLARE THAT THE
MONOPOLIES ARE FAVORED.
Dingley and Oiher Republican Leaders,
However, Guard the Interests
oi the Peop'e.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 26.â The
consideration of the tariff bill under the
five-minute rule for the purpose of amend
ment, which it was expected would be
strictly business, opened with the liveliest
political contest of the session, lasting for
nearly three hours. It began promptly
on the reading of the prefatory para
graph of the bill, to which Dockery .of
Missouri offered an amendment authoriz
ing the Secretary of the Treasury to admit
free of duty any article, the production
and price of which was controlled by a
trust in the United States.
Dingley (K.) of Maine, chairman of the
Committee on Ways and Means, made the
point that the amendment was not in or
der at that place, and Daizell (R.) ot Penn
sylvania that if it were in order as to time
Congress could not devolve on the Secre
tary a jadicial duty such as that as deter
mining whether or not a trust was in con
trol of a certain article. This precipitated
a debate based on Democratic charges that
Republicans favoied trusts and did not
want to legislate against them. All of the
leaders on both sides and some not recog
nized in that rant took part. Charges
and counter charges were bandied tack
and forth and the record of the past seven
years wa? searched to show the action of
both parties on the subject of trusts.
After near;y three hours of this skirmish*
ing, the question ostensibly beine the
point of order, General Henderson (R.) of
lowa appealed to both sides to put an end
to it, saying that if it was the desire to get
through the bill in the time allotted for
its consideration "a mighty bad start had
been mede all around." The point against
me ameudment was sustained by the
chairâ Sherman (R.) of New Yorkâ ami
on appeal his ruling was sustained, 158
to 10L
Many other amendments having the
same ooject, to put articles controlled by
trusts on the free list, were offered, and
on objection by Dingley all were ruled
out of order. Dingley stated that when
the time came to deal with trusts the Re
publican majority would do so, and that
after passing this tariff bill, if anything
remained to do for the public interest it
would attend to that.
In the course of ihe afternoon several
changes of duty were made, among them
a reduction of % cent on carbonate of
ammonia, an increase from 25 to 40 cents
a pound for the duty on sulphuric, ether,
and increa-ine the duty on products of
â¢pig lead from 2% to 3 cents a pound. At
5:15 P. M. the House adjourned until to
morrow at 10 o'clock, having disposed of
nine and a half of the 163 pases of the bill.
â¢ The consideration of me schedule of the
tariff bill in detail for the purpose of
amendment was preceded to-day by the
citation of the Lord's prayer by Chap
lain Conden.
The House then went Into the commit
tee of the whole and the clerk was in
structed to begin reading the bill.
Lanham (D.) of Texas, asked if it would
be in order at this time to move to strike
out the enacting clause which he stated if
adopted would operate as a rejection to
, the bill.
Chairman Sherman expressed the opin
ion that the motion was in order.
The motion created temporary conster
nation in the Republican ranks for there
was not a quorum of the committee pres
ent and it was apparent that a larger
â¢number of Democrats were in their seats
than Republicans.
Dingley, chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee, suggested that the mo
tion be held in abeyance until some pro
gress had been made in the reading of the
bill. when there would be a larger attend
* ance present. To press the motion now
would result only in delaying considera
tion of the bill until a quorum could be
obtained.
Laniiam suavely stated that the motion
expressed his antagonism to the bill and
he desired to press it to a vote now. r
Dalzell of Pennsylvania said thai
gentlemen on: the other side bad been
clamoring for debate, and tney knew that
- tue effect of the motion, if agreed: to,
. would work to cut off the five-minute dis
cussion.
Dockery (D.) of Missouri said there was
a precedent for the motion. In the Forty
eighth; Congress a -Representative from
Ohio had moved to strikeout the enacting
clause of a tariff bill then pending. -y
Payne (X,) of New Yorkâ But the gen
tleman must remember that that was a
motion by a Democrat to scuttle a Demo- !
cratic measure." [Laughter. 1
Chairman Sherman ruled that under the
special order the motion by the gentleman
from Texas was not then in order.
Lanhamâ Will the l chair kindly inform
me -at what stage of the proceedings it will
be in order. 'Is it when there will be a full
attendance of members?
The chairmanâ When the gentleman
proposes- the- motion again the chair will
rule upon it. [Republican applause.] â¢
When the introductory paragraph* had'
been read Dockery (D.) of Ohio offered an
amendment authorizing the Secretary of
the Treasury, when he found i that an
article on tie dutiable list was being
manufactured and its price controlled Iby
a tnm in the United States, then he
should admit the article, to the United
States free of duty. .-' .l: â ''> '..'â â â  â  â â 'â â â  â â -
To thij D.npley made the point of order
tnat â  the V amendment related to the free
Jit and that had not yet been reached;;
Dalzell made the further point that Con
gress could not confer such power on the
Secretary of the Treasury, B and? in: answer
to questions stated that no such power was
conferred by the bill on the President in :
respect to the reciprocity, features. v^;
Coo per. (D. of Texas suggested a substi
tute for.Dockery'a amendment conferring
the power upon : the President, which
Dockery said be i was perfectly willing sto
accept if it would meet the objection of
the gentleman from Pennsylvania.
Daizel! â It does not meet it at all.
Richardson (D.)of Tennesseeâ Then the
objection cannot be met and the gentle
man does not waut it ruet.
Dockery said he had drawn the amend
ment which had in mind the authority
conferred by the nineteenth section of
the bill upon the Secretary of the Trea
sury to suspend the prohibition against
the" importation of meat cattle and hides
into the United States under certain con
ditions.
Ihe point of ordfr was further discussed
by Richardson, McÃae (1).) of Arkansas,
Tawnt-y (R.) ol Minnesota, Bailey (D.) of
Texas, and Daizell (R. ) of Pennsylvania
in which Richardson said he leared that
the objection of some members to the
amendment was designed to protect trusts.
Bailey argued that the poinc was in
order, referring to a decision of t lie Forty
fig oth Congress. On the question of
trusts Bailey said that if the Republicans
would aid the Democrats in their efforts
to protrct the people from trust* he would
guarantee them an opportunity to do so.
Hepburn (R.) of lowa claimed that the
amendment was not only germane to the
bili, but also destructive of its purposes.
[Democratic laughter.]
"Don't lauLh. yet," Hepburn said,
"there is the sugar "schedule, out of which
we expect to raise fifty millions of reve
nue. Five men on the other side may
form a combination and without intend
ing to do so control the price of sugar,
thereby compelling the Secretary of the
Treasury to put that article on the free
list, and so with regard to wool, free
traders, thinking it should go on tne free
list, might easily form a sham trust to
control the price of that article and com
pelling it to be placed on the free list de
stroy ihat industry."
Bailey returned his thanks to the gen
tleman from lowa for his frankness in
admitting that his objections to "our ef
forts to destroy trus-s are that they will
interfere with "the objects of the bill."
[Democratic applause.]
Simpson (P.) of Kansas expressed his
surprise at the objections of the Republi
cans to a vote on tais amendment. It was
apparent to him that they weie much
mure concerned about tue faliingoff of
tbe revenue of the trusts than they were
of those of the Government. [Applause.]
Grosvenor (R.) ol Ohio said ii was re
freshing, absolutely refreshing to witness
the change of the attitude of the Demo
crats towiird trusts. The only law ever
passed against the trusts was the act of
18U0, recommended by a Republican
Congress and opposed by Democrats.
Tiit late Democratic administration ap
parently approved the action of its
Attorney-General, who refused to carry
oui the law. saying that it could not be
enforced. But the law was developing
under proceedings instituted by the Re
publican administration of General Har
rison, and the Supreme Court had just de
cided that it was effective !>nd of iar
reaching importance. The Damocratic
party had never done anything to disturb
trusts; they had never increased so rap
idly in the history of the Government as
during the four years of Democratic mis
rule just.ended. [Applause.)
Grosvenor said that after the Republi
can party had passed the tariff bili as it
cume from the committee it would go on
.egislatini: for the benefit of the country
without advice, consent or suggestion
from the Democrat".
Newlands (Silver) < f Nevada said the
chief trouble was ihat naif of the basic
money had been struck down, and he
desired legislation against the parent
trust, and not its offsprings and Victims
which werÂ« striving to relieve somewhat
the conditions under which the people are
suffering.
Bland (D.) of Missouri said he was sur
prised at the eccentricity of the Repub
licans in asking the chair to decide the
amendment out of order, in violation of
all parliamentary law. He asserted that
the action of ihe Republicans was in the
interests and for the benefit of trusts.
Tawney (R) of Minnesota said the motive
of the eentleman who offered the amend
j ments and of those who have supported
him, was in mase a little cheap political
capital before the country. When the
conference report on the anti-trust law
I was brought into the House in the Fifty
' first Congress, Bland raised the question
of consideration on that question, and
Bland, Dockery, Richardson, Lanham,
Roberts of Louisana, and other Democratic
leaders, voted against consideration. They
were sincere then or they were not sincere
now. [Republican applause.]
Richardson met this assertion by the
charge of unfair quotation from the Con
gressional Record. He quoted to show
that Bland had raised the question of con
sideration not because he was opposed to
the trust, but because he stat;d that he
was in favor of it to test the sense of
tne House as to whether or not it would
take up the siiver bill. [Derisive laughter
on Republican side and applause on Demo
j cratic side.]
Heruierson (R. ) of lowa, in his vigorous
breezy fashion, paid his respects to the
Democrats for introducing this political
discussion. He appealed to botn sides to
proceed with the consideration of the bill
and to stop pulling oid slumps.
Dingley briefly discussad the point of
order he had rmide. It was urged in the
interests of an early procedure in the con
sideration of the bill. When the time ar
riveu ;or dealing with the trusts tne House
could rest assured that the Republicans
would deai witl^the issue- The discus
sion on the amendment was intended to
delay cr prevent legislation to provide
revenue lor the Government and to en
courage the industries of the United
Stuies. 'But we shall *o forward," ne
said, "and when we have accomplished
that, if ;i:i v other subject demands atten
tion we shall attend to it in due time."
[Applause.]
Chairman Sherman ruled thai, the
amendment was not in order. From this
decisio:. Dockery appealed, but :he chair .
was sustained on a division by a vote of
156 to 106.
Amendments proposed by McÃae (D. )
of Arkansas, Cooper (D.) of Texas ami
Robinson (D.) of Indiana, intended as was
Dockery's to put articles controlled by
the txusts on the free list or to reduce the
duty? were also ruled out on the same
ground.
Smith (D.) of Arizona offered an amend
ment directing Collector* of Customs to
receive silver bullion of 412)^' grains weight
for tvery $1 of duties. [Applause.]
Dingley tuado the point that tnat was
not only out of order, but further proposed
to reduce duties f>o per cent. The point
was sustained and on Smith's appeal from
tbe decision Hopkins (R.) of Illinois made
the point ihat the appeal wae taken for
delay, which was also sustained.
Several other anti-trust and special-tax
propositions were offered as amendments
by Cochran (D. )-of Missouri,. De Armond
(D.) of Missouri, Smun(D.)of Kentucky,
Oiey (D.) o! Virginia and McMillan (D.)
of Tennessee.
Skinner (fop.) of North Carolina offered
his half-and-half gold and silver coinage
scheme as an amendment, but It also went
out on a point of order. The duty on car
ho:iate of ammonia was increased from
13 4 to V/i cenis a pound, the Committee on
Ways an l Means assenting to the change.
The duty on argots, crude tartar or wine
lees was changed to 1 cent a pound on all
testing less than 40 per cent tartarate of
potash, and to l'/ 2 ' cents a pound on all
testing ovpt 40 per cent.
Payne (R.) of New York stated that the
reason tnes.e articles were taken from the
free list was that the Government might
secure $424,000 of revenue from their im
portation.
McMil!in(D. ) of Tennessee moved to re
store the rate in the Wilson bill, 45 per
cent ad valorem, lor tbe duty proposed in
the bill â 75 cents a pound and 30 per cent
ail valorem â on collodion sheets and fin
ished articles therefrom, known as cellu
loid, but it was rejected.
The duty on sulphuricether was changed
from 25 to 40 cents a pound, the same as
Ifi the present law.
An amendment proposed by Bromwell
(R.) of Ohio to increase the tax on glycer
ine for the benefit of the soap manufac
turers in nis district was opposed by
Gr^venor (R. ) of Ohio.
This was the text of a hnmorous denun
ciatory speech by Clark (D.) of Missouri,
wnicti the House greatly enjoyed. He
said that when Republicans fell out,
Democrats might get their dues. He was
vaatlv pleased at the controversy between
tbe Ohio gentlemen for tbe reason that it
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 27, 1897.
had let two cats out ol the protection bag.
One was that last year the soap manufac
turers had voted "the Republican ticket
and therefore there should be no opposi
tion to them getting their share of the
swag in the bill. Another was that it ex
posed the reason for putting ashes on the
free list. He had supposed that it was
placed there for the purpose of encourag
ing the farmer to produce them, but it
seemed that the true reason was that
soap manufacturers might be able to fry a
little more fat out of the American people.
"Let me give you a suggestion," said
Clark, addressing the Republican?.
"While you are putting ashes on the free
list see to it that sackcloth accompanies
it, for I tell you you will need it if you
pass this bill." [Great laughter.]
Clark paid his attention to Cannon ( X.)
of Illinois, whom he designated, bavins
in mind that gentleman's habit of rising
arid falling on his toes while speaking, as
the "liancini; dervisn of Danville," to the
intense amusement of the HouÂ«e. When
ever it was proposed to reduce appropria
tions, said Clan:, the gentleman from
Illinois jumped up like a jack-in-the-box
and said the Fifty-third Congress was the
first as extravagant, "is that the code of
morals of the gentleman?" Clark asked.
"Is it the code of morals of the Republi
can party, that because the Fifty-third
Congress was so extravagant that there
shall never be any improvement, any re
pentance, any living of a better life?"
The gentleman, Clark went on, further
defended the action of the House by say
ing that Cleveland's Democratic adminis
tration was extravagant. "Now, I want,
once for all," ClarK said, with great ear
nestness and amid much laughter, "to
unload this Democratic old man of the
sea from the 6th of March, 1893. When
he appointed to the highest place in his
administration a soreheaded Republican
he was your friend and not ours. He was
not a Democrat. [Democratic applause.]
Bromwell (R.) o. Ohio â Does the genile
ruan believe that Jefferson was a Demo
crat?
Clark â Emphatically he was, and don't
you forget it.
Bromweilâ Well, the gentleman seems
to be forgeaing it, for he was a protec
tionist.
Clark â Thomas Jefferson was not a pro
tectionist; that is a historical lie. And
I'll tell you of another: That James Mon
roe was a Federal. st. Every book written
by Massachusetts Yankees for the past ilO
years lims perpetuated that untruth. And
there will never be any truth in tho his
tories of thÂ« country until the Yankees
quit writing them and the Southern peo
pie begin. [Laughter and applause.]
Clark spotce of tbe theory that piotec
tion was intended to fester infant indus
tries, and made fun of some that had ar
rived at the age of I<_B years, having hung
on tho public seat for the whole period
with the tenacity of a snap Ding-turtle.
[Laughter.]
"The French Government, it is said,"
said Clark, "has offered a oountv for
babies. We have not vet got down to :i*at
level of impotency. [Laughter] We can
still keep up the supply of raw uumanity,
especially in that section known as the
Wild and Woolly West. They are mostly
Democrats, and in the name of the 'great
unwasned' I appeal to you for free soap.
[Great laughter.] If you do we may hope
to attain to the degree of beauty and om
niscience possessed by thegentlemau from
Massachusetts < Walker).
Expenses could be reduced, Clark said,
by cutting off the appropriation of eight
millions for fortiiicaiions. '"If every dol
lar that has been carried since Julius
Oresar led h\n legions up the Nile was put
into the work it would not fortify over
4000 miles of seacoast. The money is
wasted, thrown away, given to Eastern
men for campaign funds. The only thing
that will fortify this country is the men
of the North, Sjuth, East aiid West, who
will march shoulder to shoulder bearing
muskets in its defense. [Applause.] Why,
Mr. Chairman, no country has any more
iden of n<:hting the United btates than I
have this minute of challenging Robert
Fuzsimnions Esq. to a fistic combat"
Here the gavel fell and Clark took his
seat, attended with loud applause.
Uromwell'* amendment was rejected.
Effort" of Burton (R.) of Ohio to equal
ize the duties on linseed and poppy-seed
oilsâ in the bill 32 and 10 cents a gallon
respectivelyâ on the ground that the dif
ference would lead to frauds on the
revenue; and of Richardson (D.)of Ten
nessee to reduce the duty on 0-per-cent
opium from $1 to 50 cents a pound were
futile.
On motion of Dalzell (R.) of Pennsyl
vania tno duties on the products of lead â
orange mineral, red lead and white lead â
was increased from 1),' t to 3 cents a pound
to maintain the difference established by
the McKinley bill between the fluty on
pig lead und that of its products.â a c nt a
pound. The Democrats objected strenu
ou-ly to the change and compelled a vote
by teller?, resulting ayes 55, noes 19.
At 5:15 p. M. the committee rose, on mo
tion of Dmcley, and the House adjourned
until 10 o'clock to-morrow.

H. H. Hanna, chairman of the Indianap

ultimate retirement of all classes of United

Letters by the liuxhel Sent by Thote IT ho
Seek Information.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 26.â
Letters by the bushel have been pouring
in on tbe Treasury Department asking for
information concerning the new law in
relation to the passing of mutilated coin,
although tnose seeking the information
might, in a majority of cases, have secured
it from the United States District Attor
neys or secret service officers of their re
spective localities. In brief, it may be ex
plained that the law its in the main an ex
tension of that against counterfeiting.
It provides that the passing of mutilated
or defaced coins or the mutilation and de
facement of coin for any purpose shall be
held to be a criminal offense, punishable
by imprisonment for a period of one to rive
years and a tine of $100 to $2000. Under
this law tbe practice of presenting ladies
with coins of gold or silver with the ini
tials of the donorengraved thereon, to b?
worn as bangles, will be a criminal of
f c n se.
The law also drives out of existence a
number of people who have made a good
living by purchasing mutilated coins at a
reduction from theii face value and plnc
ging up the holes so skiilluliy that the
original mutilation could not be discov
ered. Evon this kind of tampering with
the money oi the Government will be re
garded as an offense under the statute.

JAMESON TALKS
OF THE TRANSVAAL
Gives Reasons for the Raid
Into Paul Kruger's
Domain.
Cecil Rhodes and John Hays
Hammond Agreed in All
the Piacs
But the Doctor Declares That He Was
Not Backed b r the Home
Governm nt.
LONDON, Esq., March 26.â The Parlia
mentary South African Commission to
day resumed its inquiry into the Trans
vaal raid, in Westminster Hall. Quite a
number of the fripnds and admirers of Dr.
Jameson, (he leader of the famous raid,
were present, it being known that he
would be called upon to give liis evidence.
The examination of W. P. Schreiner,
who was Attorney-G?ner:il of Cape Col
ony, under the premiership of Cecil
Rhodes, was continued by Mr. Chamber
lain, who by his questions showed that
he waÂ« anxious to procure a vindication
of his policy in connection with the
Transvaal question. Mr. Schreiner's evi
dence was of little interest, and upon its
conclusion Dr. Jameson was called.
Dr. Jameson was pale, but self-con taineu.
He read a statement in which he said the
design of the leaders of the reform move
ment in Johannesburg was to act alone
to the end of obtaining a plebiscite and
electing a President. His (Jameson's)
force, he said, only intended to maintain
order and nothing more. He referred to
a number of conversations he had with
Mr. Khodes on the federation of South
Africa, which is a pet scheme of the ex-
Colonial Prime Mini>ter. They had dis
cussed the attitude of the Transvaal and
the obstacles it presented to the plan of
federation.
He then proceeded to give the details of
conversations had between himself, Mr.
Rhodes and John H. Hammond, the Amer
ican mining enpineer, who was subse
quently arrested at Johannesburg and
sentenced to death for the part he had
taken in the Johannesburg troubles. They
discussed the grievances of the foreign
residents of the Transvaal and the onerous
restrictions placed by the Boer Govern
ment upon the raining operations in the
Rand. It was the opinion of Mr. Ham
mond that the conditions in the Trans
vaal, so far as foreigners were concerned,
were insupportable, and that unle3s the
Boer Government made some attempt to
redress their grievances the people of
Johannesburg would revolt.
Continuing, Dr. Jameson said that he
was impressed by the views and represen
tations of Mr. Hammond, and subse
quently went with him to Pretoria, the
capital of the Transvaal, where he learned
taut Mr. Hammond's views were correct.
The result of tiis investigations led to the
preparation of the forces of the British
South Afro Company, in order that if a
revolt occurred at Johannesburg they
would be in readiness to render aid. Last
year he had visited Johannesburg and
learned that the residents had finally
determined to force matters to an issue.
He was informed as to the plans that were
to be followed.
The first proposal was for the people of
Johannesburg to act alone, but the com
pany's troops were to be in readiness on
the border in case they were required.
Later the lenders concluded there was no
hope of success without the help of an
armed force, and they decided that the
only way to obtain reforms was to change
the administration of the Transvaal, and
that the safest mode of effecting this
would be to have a sufficient force at
Johannesburg to induce President Kruger
to take a plebiscite of the whole popula
tion to decide who was to be President.
They, therefore, invited Dr. Jameson's
help, and it was arranged to take the com
pany's force to Johannesburg to maintain
order and bring pressure to bear upon the
Transvaal, while the redress of the griev
ance was enforced. It was also arranged
that as soon as the revolt occurred in
Johannesburg, Dr. Jameson and his lorce
were to start across the border for that
city.
Dr. Jameson further said that he told
Mr. Rhodes of the plan that had been ar
ranged, and that Mr. Rhodes agreed to
them.
The statement then proceeded to give
the details oi the actual mid into the Boer
territory. In this Dr. Jameson said he
acted entirely upon his own responsi
bility.
In reply to a question by Mr. Labou
chere, Dr. Jameson said that he had never
been informed that the officers of the
British Government supDorted his action.
Further, replying to a question, he ex-
Dressed the belief that me public has
always held regarding the raid, to the
effect that he knew now that the raid into
the Transvaal was a mistake because it
had not been successful. It fee succeeded
he would have been forgiven.
His answers to the questions were given
in a clear, firm voice and without evasion.

i OTTAWA, Canada, March 26.â 50 far
there are no indications that the Dominion
proposes to work itself into a fever of en-'
thusiasm â  over l t the celebration of the
Queen's jubilee. Suggestions have been
made here and there concerning ways,
means and methods by wtiich this portion
â¢of her Majesty's possessions might demon
strate V the ' loyaity of : the people in this
eventful year; but they have been of a
spasmodic nature and have ; -'not been
prompt 'd by people '. having particular
stain! ing and weight, and have failed to
receive any considerable encouragement.
; Perhaps the most pretentious scheme is
that of Lady Aberdeen, who proposes ; the
.founding of an order of nurses and homes,
to Jbe : known ias 1 the Victorian Order of
Home-helpers. It is proposed to I raise a
minimum fund of ; $500,000, or as f much
more as may] be forthcoming, for the ; pur
pose of constructing buildings in different
centers and putting the scheme upon its
feet, the understanding being that the
different localities here furnish sufficient
money to keep the order on a substantial
basis.
Under the scheme, which has not yet
been fully outlined by Lady Aberdeen,
about fifty homes and a hundred home
helpers or nurses are allotted to Manitoba
and the Northwest, and to maintain these
would require a yearly subscription of
some $30,000â something after the plan of
the Prince of Wales' perpetual endowment
for the London hospitals. The distribution
of subscription lists has been commenced,
but the indications are that the proposi
tion will not take like wildfire.
OVERCOME BY GAS IN A TUNNEL.
While Directing Work of Rypair Superin
tendent of Construction Jennison of
the Western Union Perishes.
DENVER, Colo., March 26.â For some
time past the Western Union and Col
orado Midland wires have been somewhat
interfered with in the cable running
through the Bust tunnel, twenty miles
west of Leadville. This weet the super
intendent of construction of the Western
Union, H. E. Jennison, with several
linemen and the sectionmen have been
at work replacing sections of the cable.
The work would have been completed to
day had not a serious accident occurred
in the form of gas accumulating in the
tunnel, which is two miles in length.
Yesterday the men were almost overcome
by gas, requiring the aid of an engine to
bring them to the open air.
â Before entering to-day they were cau
tioned to be careful and leel their way.
All were supposed to have been well
until the engineer of a passing train
noticed the men lying around in heaps, ap
parently all dead. The engine was imme
diately taken Irom the tram and backed
into the tunnel and the unfortunate men
brought to the open air. Doctors from
Leadville were dispatched on a special
train, and after they had treated me men
for several hours all of them were re
suscitated except Superintendent Jen
nison, who was past all aid. and at 4:30
p. m. t' c doctors pronounced him dead.
Mr. JenniÂ«on was well known in all
the Western States and Territories, hav
ing held the position of superintendent ol
construction of the Western Union Tele
graph Company, with headquarters at
Omaha, for the past twenty-live years.
PZAIX TALK JT.V THE COMItOAS.
Michael Jtaritt Says That l> 'tec live t

LONDON, Exg., March 26.â The House
of Commons 10-day debated the votes for
the Home Office. In the course of the
discussion Michael Davitt, the well-known
Irish leader, declared that the members of
the secret service plotted the recent dyna
mate scare, the prosecution of Edward J.
Ivory for complicity, in which the alleged
plot resulted in a complete fiasco. M.T.
Davis sad that the purpose of the secret
service in originating the scare was to
make an official reclaim.
The Solicitor - General denied Mr.
Davitt's statement, adding that the prose
cution of Ivory had collapsed solely from
lock of evidence.
Sir M uthew White Kidley, the Home
Secretary, stated that there was convinc
ing evidence of the existence of a plot. If
Ivory, Tynan and the other conspirators
hr.ti 'iot been arrested great damage to
life and property would have been none.
John Dillon, leader of the anti-Parnell
ites, asserted that the secret service money
had been used to entice men who were
innocent of crime.
James C. Flynn, anti-Parnellite, moved
a reduction of the amount. This was re
jected.

FRESH VICTORY
FOR FILIBUSTERS
Judge Locke Declines to
Order the Dauntless
Into Custody.
I "*â 
Dec' ares That He Is Not Bound
by the Ruling Regarding
the Three Friends.
In a Federal Court at Baltimore Dr.
Jose Luis Is Convicted of
Conspiracy.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 26. â W.
A. Bisbee, owner of the steam tue; Daunt
less, scored another victory this morning
in the United States court in the suit
brought by the Government for forfeiture
of his vessel for alleged violation of the
neutrality laws of the United States. The
Government attorneys presented a peti
tion for an order directing that the Daunt
less be taken into custody by the Marshal
and tuat the bond given by the claimant
be annulled.
After argument Judge LocKe declined
to grant the motion, which was based
upon the mandate of the Supreme Court
in the Three Friends case.
The Judge held that the case against
the Dauntless differed in many respects
from the case against the Three Friends,
and he held that iv the decision of the Su
preme Court the lower court before which
such oases are pending is given authority
to act as in its judgment the status of the
case required. The Judge did not issue a
formal order, but took the matter under
advisement. He intimated, however, that
be would not grant the motion for the
cancellation of the bond, but would allow
the vessel to be used by its owner, pro
vided a deputy marshal was placed ia
charge.
This decision was entirely satisfactory
to the oivncr, and he will at once apply
for clearance for Nassau or some otuer
port in the Bahamas.
In connection with the libel against the
vessel the owner this morning filed an
answer to the amended libel, in which he
declares that she has never been an armed
cruiser as churged. He denies emphati
cally that the Dauntless has ever been
used in any way 10 entitle her to forfeit
ure, by the Government.

BALTIMORE, Md., March 26.â The jury
in the case of Dr. Jose Luis, who has been

hearing of the motion for a new trial. The
penalty is a fine not exceeding $3000 and

Tltuty of Aid for Cuba.
NEW YORK. N. V., March 27. â A
World special from Miami, Fla., says:
Another expedition left early yesterday
morning for Cuba from a key 100 miles
south of here with medical stores and am
munition, including 500 rounds for dyna
mite guns.
The Cubans sent down a large schoonej
some weeks ago loaded to the water's
edge with war, material.
She has been anchored inside the keys
at an unfrequented spot nnd has supplied
cargoes for several tugioads to Cuba. /
One large unknown iuk from New York
is doing most of the work for the Cubans.
One day she comes oui with black fun

Eight or nine changes have been made

SHASTA COUNTY'S
PRODUCTIVE SOIL
Fields Yield Rich Harvests
and Orchards Fruit in
Abundance.
Fertility of the Land Backed by
a Climate Unsurpassed in
California.
Redding, the County Seat, One of the
Mcst Charming Cities in tb.3
Golden State.
REDDING, Cal., March 25.â Shasta
County, California, is situated at the head
of the Sacramento Valley, and is the sec
ond county south of the boundary De
tween California and Oregou. Its great-
Mr. Bush has been a resident of Shasta
County forty-six years; County Judge for
over ten years; delegate to the National
Bepublican Convention at Chicago, 1884,
that nominated Blame; Postmaster at
Redding for lonr years under Harrison;
organized the Shasta County Bank, now
cashier and manager of the same; presi
dent of the Board of Trade of Redding;
president of the Republican League of
Shasta County. Is now and always has
been an active worker in the Republican
party.
est lengtti from east to we.st is ninety
miles, and from north to south sixty
miles. The mountains of the Sierra
Nevada and Coast ranges cover a large
portion of the county on all sides except
the south. They are rugced and lofty,
rising in places more than 5000 feet above
the sea level. In the southery portion of
the county is a foothill region, half circu
lar in shape, forming the northern end of
the Sacramento Valley proper. The cen
tral and southern portions of this foothill
region consist of table land?, varying in
altitude from 500 to 700 feet above sea
level, cut by many streams of water form
ing narrow valleys.
The soil of the valleys is alluvial or sedi
ment, containing a good deal of disinte
grated rock or gravel. Color of soil, light
red or reddish brown, rich and productive.
In these valleys the raisin and the best
varieties of table grape, the peacb, prune,
fig and apricot grow very rapidly, the land
predating abundantly large and luscious
grapes and fruiis. The tabe-lands be
tween valleys are mostly sandy clay loam,
granite, and clay soils, timbered â scatter
ing ork and pine â and more or less cov
ered on surface with gravel and bowlders.
These table-lands or mesas are peculiarly
:-uited to the growth and perfection of j
such fruits cs pear, olive, fig, nectarine,
quince and apple and for line wine grape.
While in the high and mountainous
part of the county the winters are cold
and snow falls to a sreat depth Sometimes
in this foothill region crass grows green
and roses bloom during the entire winter
season from November to April, the low
est thermometer ever known being 18 deg.
above zero, and that on:y for an hour or
two in the morning, the general range for
the winter months being from 36 deg. to
to 70 dec. above. No windstorms have
ever visited this section. No serious
apring frosts have occurred in the
pas'. The average yearly rainfall ia 38
inches, and is generally distributed
(luring the months of September, Oc
tober, November, December, January,
February, March, April, May and j
some seasons, middle of June, thus render
ing irrigation ior fruit trees and vineyards
unnecessary. During these months the
climate is simply superb. From the mid
dle of June to middle of September the j
weather is warm. Tuis is the dijagree- I
Ã¼blepartof the year, but while the ther
mometer sometimes reaches 110 degrees
and does that for several days in suc
cession the ai- is dry and pure, the nights
charmingly cool .and men, women and i
children go on with their work ot eather- I
ing, curing, packing and shipping the
luscious fruit, which is made so superior
by these very climatic conditions and suf
fer no great inconvenience from beat.
The California and Oregon Railroad
(San Francisco to Portland) passes
through the county, and freight and pas
senger rates to and from points east and
northeast are the same as they are to San
Francisco, Sacramento, San Jose or Los
Anceles.
The population of the county is 20,000.
Schools and churches are ample far the
accommodation of all who desire to at
tend. ,
Our chief industries are agriculture,
fruit growing, stock raising, dairying,
mining, quarrying and lumbering.
For heaithfulness the county generally
is unsurpassed, and some diseases, such
as asthma, catarrh, bronchitis and all
kinds of lang diseases, are benefited by
residence here.
The market here is the best. The min
ing and lumbering interests of this and
adjoining counties create a home market
for a very large proportion of oar pro
ducts, while the railroad carries the sur
plus east, by way of Portland and Sacra
mento, going at once into the cooler cli
mate of higher altitudes, reaching the
market twenty-four hours in advance of
shipments from central and southern por
tions of the State.
The scenery here h of the grandest in
this grand State. Health-giving springs
abound in every portion of the county.
There is no county containing so many
and such large streams of water. Fishing
and hunting may be indulged in to the
heart's content.
Redding, the county seat, is on the Cal
ifornia and Oregon Railroad, eighteen
miles from the south line of the county.
It is the geographical center of that por
tion of California north of the third stan
dard line, including the counties of Siski
you. Trinity, Shasta, Tehama, Colusa and
Butte, the larger portions of Modoc, Las
sen, Plumas, Del Norte and Hum bold t,
and' smaller portions of Lake, Mendocino
and Yuba, a territory 194 milee in diame
ter
It ia also the center of population of the
same territory â the trade center and dis j
tributing point for an immense area in al
directions, and will continue to be so for
many years. Redding is without doubt
one oi the most charming gems In Cali
fornia. Snugly nestled in the laD of the
northern Sacramento Valley, with the
beautiful Sacramento River at its very
feet, gliding through the rich valley land,
thu location of tnis flourishing city is
renowned for sublimity and picturesque
ness. The business buildings are mostly
brick, and some of them :ire very hand
some structures. The city is supplied
with electric lights and excellent water
works. Population 3000. Two magnifi
cent bridges span the river between the
city and the country adjoining on the
east, which for about eighteen nr.les eust
erly is a table-land, twenty-rive feet above
high water in the river, and is cut north
and iouth by three beautiful valleys.
There are a nnmber of new buildin gs
contracted for this spring and everything
indicates more than usuai activity for the
ensuing season in business circles. The
men prominently connected with the
town for a number of years past and who
take an active interest in the development
and growth of the city and country
around are: C. C. Bush, now manager of
the Bank of Shasta County, president of
the Board of Trade and the pioneer resi
dent of Redding: William GillesDie, man
ager of the Railroad Hotel and eating
houses; H. Clineschraidt, proprietor of
the Temple Hotel and now a member of
the Board of City Trustees; O. E. Nash,
encaged in general merchandise and also
member of the Board of Trustees. Many
other citizens are noted for theii liberality
and enterprise.
Amoiu" other towns in tbe county are
Anderson and Cottonwool on the rail
road, bDth situated In the fruit-producing
belt,' and botn good shipping points.
Much Has been done tne past tnree years
in the development of the mining indus
tries of the country in the immediate vi
cinity of Redding, and many thousands of
dollars have been spent in the buildinz of
railroads, erection of smelters, Stamp
mills, etc.
The largest earn pis th* Mountain Copper
Company (limited). The mines are about
fourteen miles from Redding, the smelters
about seven mile*. A railroad, built two
years ago, connects mines and smelters
with the main line. About 500 men are
employed. The ore yields copper, silver
and gold in the order named, l'he Hart
(or Texas and Georgia) mines nre about
six miles north of Redding and employ
from 75 to 150 men.
There are many other smaller mines,
employing from five to twenty men each,
within a radius of a few miles from Red
ding. East of the town about forty mileb
are the timber lands of the Shasta Lumber
Company, connected by linme and rail
with the main line at Anderson. Many
men are employed in connection with
this enterprise during the summer months.
Stock-raising is confined principally to
the foothill region and elevated plateaus
in the eastern and northeastern portions
of the county, where good ranee is found
and soil and climate are adapted to the
growth of nutritious grasses, both wild and
cultivated, cereal 3 and corn. The lower
valleys are the fruit-producing sections.
Nature seems to have exhausted her
vocabulary in fittinsr Shasta County.
While there are no great bodies of what is
termed agricultural or wheat-producing
lands there is enough that with proper
cultivation will produce eood crops-
There is fruit land, grape land, grass
and corn lands, timber land, coal and
stone lands, gold, silver, copper, iron,
limestone, granite, sandstone, everything.
An empire larger in area, than Rhode Is
land and capable of supporting its popu
lation independent of any other section.
The Sacramento River passes through the
county from north to south. The Pit and
McOloud empty into it. A lew miles north
of Redding there are numerous beautiful
falls on these streams. The county
abounds in health-giving springs. Takoh
as a whole, Shasta County offers many in
ducements to home-seekers and capital
ists. Labor in these days is abundant
everywhere and the supply in this county
ia fully equal to the demand.

VICTORY FOR PIO
PICO'S DAUGHTERS
Win Their Suit for the
Spanish Ex-Governor's
Property.
Will Now Lay Claim to Lands
Not Included in the
Distribution.
Abila Tract in Los Angeles One of
the Sections They Aspire to
Possess.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 28.â An
interesting bit of litigation baa been oc
cupying the attention of Judge Clark in
the Superior Court here for many days. It
is the determinate action in a long series
of litigations respecting the disposition of
the estate of ex-Governor Pio Pico. It is
believed that the case now concluded
marks the end of this lengthy litigation,
or rather one pnase of it. In a manner,
however, it is a preliminary to another
series of suits, which may involve vast
sums of money and the titles to large
tracts of land and valuable improved
property.
Pio Pico wes the last Spanish Governor
of California. Before the occupation by
the Americans he was vastly wealthy. He
died in poverty, and his sole estate con
sisted, according to the administrator, of
an old silver watch ana two or three
horses, with some other minor personal
property. But this was not all. He had
two daughters â Griselda Pico and Joa
quina de Moreno.
These daughters contested the distribu
tion, but the personal property went to his
son, Alfred Pico. The daughters claimed
there was more, including some valuable
city property and a one-fourth interest in
several large ranches. They also claimed
the Abila Tract in this city.
Some months ago there was organized
in San Francisco a company of wealthy
men, whose purpose was to secure for
these daughters the money and land they
claimed. The best legal talent wits en
gaged. Horace Appel, a fluent speaker of
the Spanish language, of this city, was
employed, and entered suit in behalf of
the two daughters. Now he has won the
case, and tiiis rrforninp's decree declares
the two daughters the children of -Pio
Pico, and solely entitled to the property
distributed.
Having established their claim in this
suit the daughters will begin a legal fight
for the valuable property which they
allege fa theirs by right.
Sanaalito ' Mam- Meeting.
;. SAUSALITO, : Cal.; r March 26. â From
'every indication the mass-meeting of the
citizens of bo usalito to be held at the Town
Hall Saturday evening promises to he a
big affair. ; The recent fire, destroying five
buildings on Water street, has aroused the
people to the necessity of devising ways
and means for obtaining proper lira appa-
ratus for the use of the local Fire Depart
ment. Men who bave taken little interest
in tne affairs of tne town before are now
putting forth their energies to make tbe
meeting of to-morrow night a success, and
prominent citizens have agreed to address
the assemblage.
NEW SAUSAUTO CLUBHOUSE.
San Francisco Yacht Club Members to
Erect a Two- Story Structure
en Water Street
SAUSALITO. Cal., March 26.â At a
meeting of the board of directors of the |
San Francisco Yacht Club it was decided
to build a new clubhouse on the site of its
building whic^i was burned on Sunday
morning on Water street. The new struct
ure will be two stories in height and con
tain billiard-rooms and lockers for the
members of the club. It haa been defi
nitely decided not to have a bar or a
kitchen in the new building.
The first story will be arranged in such
a manner that boats owned by members
of the club can be stored thepein, and a
complete set of lockers will be built. In
the second story the billiard and club
rooms will occupy the entire available
space. The boats which were stored in
the old building before tbe fire are now
teing cared for at the clubhouse of the
Pacihc Yacht Club in Sausalito. Upon
the completion of the new structure the
boats will be taken to the new quarters.
One feature of the new clubhouse will
be a ladies' room. The sides and front of
the building will, according to the present
intention, be of glass, affording the visitor
a view of the bay and the surrounding
country.
The plans are to make the building art
istic as well as specially suitable for the
purposes of the club. The directors have
not decided as to the date when work will
be commenced on the building, but they
realize that without a clubhouse and
meeting- placo the members would sooa
become dissatisfied, and they intend to
complete arrangements with all possible
haste.
FRESNO'S LAND SWINDLES. \
Hundred Thousand Club Defers. Judg
ment Upon the Action of
Agent Griffith.
FRESNO, Cal., March 2G.â The Hun
dred Thousand Club last night investi
gated the charges against ono of its mem
bers, S. N. Griffith, of bringing men here
from Chicago and selling them land at
exorbitant prices under false representa
tions. The real estate agent was neither
condemned nor vindicated, but the action
of the club savored very much of the
former. A resolution was adopted deter
ring judgment upon the condition that
Mr. Griffith provide immediate employ
ment for the live men already here and
agree to care ami provide for such aildi
tio.ial men or families as may come here
under his representations.
The imniigrationist refused to accept
this action of the club, demanding a full
vindication. This was not forthcoming,
and if Mr. Griffith does not procure wortc
for the men by next week the club may
take further action.
The only thing that saved Mr. Griffith
from expulsion from the club was an in
geniously worded letter lrom 0. B. Shaver
of the Fresno Flume and Irrigation Com
pany saying that "forty men could be em
ployed at the mills" at Clovis. where the
agent had lots to soil at $150 apiece, or
about $130 more than they were worth. In
Chicago Mr. Griffith represented to the
five menthatthey could get employment
immediately upon their arrival in Fresno
provided they would ccli sign a contract
to take a town lot at $150. . The work was
not forthcoming when they arrived. Dur
insr the investigation- the land agent ad
mitted that he might have been too
"neglectful" of the men.
Tne proceedings of the inquiry were
highly interesting, as Mr. Griffith made a
spirited defense.

NANAIMO, B. C, March 26.-The
steamer Barbara Boacowitz, which ar
rived this morning from the north, brings
news of the wreck and total loss of the
steamer Willapa on Regatta Reef, near
Bella Coola, last Friday. The steamer
struck during the snowstorm early in the
morning, and when it was found that the
pumps bad no effect, the passengers and
baggage were landed on Campbell Island,
two miles away. On Sunday last they
were picked up by the Boscowitz and re
moved to Bella Coola, where they now
are.
The Boscowitz also brings word that the
steamer Dora went upon the rocks on
Green Island, near Port Simpson, last
week, but was got off and beached.
BLOWN ASHORE BY THE GALE.
Steamer Cyrus Walkar Aground on Fox
Island and Its Log Tow
Scattered.
TACOMA, Wash., March 26.â Reports
from near-by Sound ports are beginning
to come in, telling of the damage done to
shipping by yesterday's gale. Tbe most
serious disaster leil to tbe lot of the
steamer Cyrus Walker, with a big boom of
logs in tow. The steamer is now hard and
fast on the beach of Fox Island, while the
logs are scattered along the shore line for
miles.
T:e boom which the Walker bad in tow
consisted of fourteen sections, which
were cut at Shelton and destined for Port
Gamble. When the blow came on the
steamer was not only not able to make
any headway with its tow, but was itself
blown upon the beach, where it was left
by the receding tide. When the boom
struck tbe beach it was the work of a very
minutes for the wares to break it up and
destroy all resemblance to a ran.
The steamer Favorite left this morning
for the s-cene of the disaster, where it will
endeavor to release the Walker from its
uncomfortable position and then proceed
to gather up whatever of the broken boom
can be recovered.
The Walker is a side-wheel towing
steamer, about 38 feet wide and 130 feet in
length. It was built on the Sound years
ago and contained heavy machinery,
which will increase the difficulty of get
ting it back into the water. The Port
Gamble Mill Company owns the vessel.
WANTS A SAN JOSE ESTATE.
Woman Claiming to Be a Relative of the
Late Miser Drertus Denounced as
en Impostor.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 20. â What
bears the semblance of an attempt to steal
Â«n unclaimed estate by mean* of forgery
was brought to light to-day in Judge Hy
land's courtroom. This was the time set i
for bearing the claim of Mrs. Mary J. j
Friend of Phoenix, Ariz., to the estate of
Frank Dreilu?, an old. miser, who died in
this city about a year ago. Dreifus, or
Uraves, as he was sometimes known, left
property valued at $4455. No relative
con lit be found and the estate was about
to be distributed to the State when a few
days ago a petition was tiled by Mrs.
Friend, who set up the claim that she was
a cousin of the deceased. When the claim
of Mrs. Friend was filed Judge Hyland
appointed Attorney F. B. Brown to repre
sent the State in the matter.
Mrs. Friend was in court to-day and pre
sented, in support of her claim to fcinsnip,
a number of letters purported' to have
been written bj Dreifus about ten years
ago. The letters were put under micro
ocopical examination by District Attorney
Hernngion, who was invited by the court
to take & hand in the affair. They all bore
evidenceotb&vingbeen tampered with as to
the signatures, and the sentiment of them
appears to be that which a son would ex
press toward a mother and not as passing
between cousins. The signatures were bad
imitations of Dreifus', and the court and
Attorney Brown pronounced them as tne
rankest kind of forgery.
Mrs. Friend was not represented by
counsel, and the court continued the case
for a week. It is not believed that she
will again put in an appearance.

being held on suspicion of having been
implicated in a number of burial uries re
cently committed, will be taken to Oak
land to answer to similar charges there.
The handwriting of Hess and Ham mil;

In the past few months Hess and Ham

Sixties.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., March 26.â
The organization of a Grand Army post
at this place has long been agitated, and
the talk has at last ended in something
substantial. On Wednesday evening

came over from Salinas to institute the
new post and to muster in the members.
D. J. King and D. J. McDougail, both of
Steedman Post No. 56, Salinas, assisted
in the work, and twenty-eight charter
members were swo'n in.
When the new organization was first
contemplated and a name was beins
cbosen for it that of John C. Fremont was
selected as being the most appropriate be
cause of General Fremont's connection
with the early historical events of this
locality; but word was received from
headquarters that that name had been
used in all its variations, and could not be
eivpn to this post. Therefore the post at
Pacific Grove will bo known as Lucius
Fairchild Post No. 179.
The post having been organized and
mustered in the following officers were
elected for the ensuing year: I. Manning
King, P. C. ; E. Michnelis. S. V. C. ; J. R.

STOCKTON JUDGE'S PROTEST.
His Views Not in Accord With a Prece
dent Established by the Supreme
Court.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 26. â Judge
Budd this morning took a whack at the
Supreme Court. In the case of the People
against De Force, one of the alleged Lodi
burglars, bis Honor yesterday raisedjthe
point that inasmuch as the defendant was
charged in the information as "John Doe"
and committed to jail by nis true name,
the proceeding was not proper, and the
information should be set aside. The
court stated then that he desired to give
the matter furthar consideration, and he
asked the District Attorney to show him
any Supreme Court decisions bearing
upon the point. The District Attorney
found a ruling of the higher tribunal up
holding the information in a similar case.
Judge Budd this morning said that he
was therefore constrained, much against
his better judgment, to uphold the infor
mation in tnis case. He further remarked
that the prisoner Lad been held to an
swer without probable cau<je. He re
viewed the evidence, and said that there
was nothing but the confession of a "self
confessed thief and burglar" to warrant
De Force's detention ; but the court added
that the mntter could not be reached by
the present proceedings.
"I intend, 1 ' saia Judge Swinnerton for
the prisoner, "to bring this case before t:. â¢
Supreme Court yquarely on this pointâ
whether a. man can be deprived of his con
stitutional rights ; whether the guarantee
that 'no man shall be deprived of his
liberty without probable cause' means
anything, or whether it is merely an idle
phrase? It the Supreme Court has made
such a ruling, it is high time that it
should be changed."

The Story of the Shipments and the
Ore ia Sight-R fused an Off r
of $4,000,000.
Colonel I. N. Peyton, the leading owner
of the oeleorated Le Roi mine at Rossland,
B. C, is amonsr the arrivals here. He has
come up from his winter home at Kama
Barbara, where his family resides, and is
on his way to the mine. Colonel Peyton
has been with the property ever since it
was a prospect, and has seen it develop
till now it is the greatest mine in the
North. It is a gold property and prom
ises immense and long continued divi
dends.
Colonel Peyton was for some time a
miner. ia the San Juan country in Colo
raao prior to going to the Northwest, but
the mineral in the fissures there was not
>(rf ;i sufficient grade to suit him. He went
m Spokane, and some time thereafter trc
*an mining in the Colville country. But
it was, as he explained yesterday, unsatis
factory to him and be early went to Ross
lund to begin the serious business of min
ing for gold. In this he was eminently
successful. In all his efforts fortune
smiled on him, and he and his associates
have to-day a mine for which they have
refused $4,000,000. .
"Our unce is $4,500,000 and we do not
care to take any less," saia he at the
Palace yesterday! "There have been sev
eral persons figuring on the mine. One of
these was a man representing, or claiming
to represent, the London Exploration
Company, and another was a noted ex
pert who bad a certified check for $100,000
on a Montreal bank, which he showed as
a guarantee that he was what he repre
sented himself to be. A telegram there,
too, brought t c reply that ne had mat
cmount to his credit there. We were
ottered $4,000,000 for the mine, but con
cluded not to sell for that."
Colonel Peyton receives telegrams every
day regarding the development of the
Rossland bonanza, which has given such
renown in recent months to British
Columbia mining. Tne one he received
yesterday' said, in part: "'Concentration
a success; fifiy-one tons give $204 metallic
gold from ptat*s; loss in tailings low.
Nine feet solid shipping ore in face of 500
west drift. Six feet of ore in bottom of
shaft."
The latter shaft is now 530 feet deep.
"On Monday, March 29," said Colonel
Fey ton, "we will pay a dividend of $25,000. ]
We pay a dividend every month. In Jan- :
vary we paid $50 000. This fifty-one tons \
the dispatch alludes to is from the dumps.
We are gathering this up now and concen
trating it.
"We have just put in a new plant of
machinery, costing* $100,000. Included in I
ttie machinery is a Rand compressor, with
com round Corliss condensing engines.
We are- also putting in a new hoist, with
Â« capacity o/ 500 tons a day.
"At present we have hoisting facilities
for 200 tons, but these are insufficient.
The mine has been producing and ship
ping 150 tons a day. That is what it is
lining now. With the new plant we wili
ship from- 250 to 300 tons a day. This is
about as it seems to us now. At present I
we are working 135 men.
"Our ore goes to a number of different
places for treatment. Some of it is sent to ;
the -British Columbia Smelting and Min
ing Company of Trail Creek and the re
mainder, to "Everett, Tacoma and East
Helena. We have shipped a little, too, to
Great Falls.
"It looks to me as though there would
be a tremendous rush to British Columbia
this year, and particularly to the country
â¢boot Rossiand. I am afraid there will j
be too many and that we will have too |
much of a boom. I don't believe in that. |

A railroad, the Spokane and Northern,

VIEWS OF LOS ANGELES AND AUBURN.
Their Respective .Mayors Give Lucid Reasons Pro and Con.
"" Â» JI .New Constitution.
Los Angeles, Cal,, March 24, 1897.
Editor Call : The question of calling a constitutional convention is one that should
receive serious and earnest consideration at the hands of every man that calls Cali
fornia home. Under the provisions of the resolution adopted by both houses of the
Legislature, the people at the next general election will be given an opportunity to
vote for or against the proposition. It is well that the matter is to be settled by
M. P. SNYDER, Mayor of Los Angles.
popular vote. In no other way should it be decided. The common people most feel
the effects of a constitution, good or bad.
There is a wide difference of opinion in this end of the State as to whether a new
constitution is needed. Many declare that the constitution framed twenty years ago
is not the constitution under which the State should work to-day. They declare that
it is "too dense" ; that it is unlike the constitution of any other State in the Union, in
that it attempts to cover too many subjects and is not founded on the fundamental
principles of law.
On the other hand many declare that the State constitution is satisfactory to
them. These people say that for years the people have been given an opportunity to
vote for or against amendments, and that with but few exceptions only those amend
ments which should be were adopted.
The State iias enjoyed a remarkable growth during the last twenty years in
wealth, in population and in the development of its many resources. It is a question
whether a constitution adopted twenty years ago, when the conditions were so differ
ent, should be us?d today. It is true that the constitution of the United States is as
when adoi-ted, notwithstanding the many changes in the country's condition; but
the constitution of California attempts more than the constitution of the United
States. Had the framers of the State constitution had only the fundamental principles
of law in mind at the time of their labors there would be no reason for now considering
the question of calling a constitutional convention.
It is my opinion that our State constitution should be simplified. This will have
to be done some day, and the sooner the better. The adoption of a new constitution
might put an end to the wholesale introduction of amendments to the constitution at
each session of the Legislature. â¢
As I have said before, I believe in the people settling this question. If they vote
for a convention let us have one, if tney vote against the proposition let the matter
end there. The common people should rule. Yours respectfully,*

BIG DRIVEWAY
How the Road From the

May Be Built.
| The Boulevard Association in
Favor of Keeping Things
Moving.
A Meeting of All the M:mb:rs Called
for Tuesday Ev ning at the
Baldw n Hole.
The San Francisco Boulevard and Driv
ing Association will bold a meeting at the
Baldwin Hotel Tuesday evening of next
week. The following letter has been sent
to tna members calling them together for
the first time in a long while:
San Francisco, March 25. 1897.
Dear Sir: As a member of the San Fran
cisco Boulevard aud Driving Association you
are hereby notified that a meeting of the asso
ciation w;ll be held at the Baldwin Hotel on
Tuesday evening, March 30, at 8 o'clock.
v\ hi..- we have not bad a general meeting
lor a while, the executive committee and the
construction committee have been actively
and faithfully at work, and have accomplished
much, although they have been working un
der many difficulties.
You have no doubt become familiar with
the fact that we have succeeded in having the
water company and Mayor Sutro execute deeds
to the City for the land necessary to build a
boulevard from seventh avenue" (which we
already have had graded and macadamized)
to the Trocadcro, that suoscriptions amount
ing to $10,000 have been obtained and that
the unemployed men of the City are at this
time engaged on this great public and chari
table work.
It is the intention to continue this enterprise
and ultimately to reach San Jose. To do so
successfully we must have the co-operation of
every citizen as well cs tne public cfficiaU.
We request you to attend this meeting, hear
what our construction committee aud officers
have to rcpoit and to help us with your advice
and presence. Faithfully,
Charles C. Bemis, President.
Joseph Magkkk, Secretary.
Tbe construction committee of (be asso
ciation is composed of Cornelius O'Con
nor, John Mctord and C. C. Bemis. The
greatest of these, it is admitted all round,
is Cornelius O'Connor. He has labored
hard and fast and Jong for the creat drive.
All the committee-men, directors and of
ficers have done that. They see in the fu
ture a practically unparalleled drive from
the Presidio and the Palace Hotel to San
j 0S ce â a splendid macadamized road
"parked' 1 and planted with a border of
shade trees, over liity miles in a stretch
through a beautiful countryâ from the
Golden Gate to the heart of Santa Clara.
"It has been very difficult to get this
Auburn, Cal., March 26, 1897.
Editor Call : I do not hesitate when I say that Ido not favor the move lor a new
constitution. A radical change would tend to disrupt business, and it would take ten
years to get a new constitution in the working shape of the present one. There are
many changes that could be made in the present constitution that would probably be
to the convenience of all, but I would prefer the ills we have rather than "fly to those

we know not of." The change would cost the Siate a large sum nf money, while no
one would be materially benefited except the lawyers. I think San Francisco is the
interested party in this proposed change, and her aruor might be cooled somewhat if
our laws were amended so as to prevent so much State interference in her municipal
affairs. Cities of her class should be allowed to govern themselves, and the rest of us
should be glad to be relieved of the responsibility.
thing going," said Secretary Joseph Mag
r.er last evening. "Such a movement is
slow at Retting under way, but now has
acquired a momentum tuat should be
taken advantage of to carry it to comple
tion. We have now $15,000 collected. The
money comes in much easier than it did.
We need $30,000, however, to carry the
road to the Trocadero. We want every
member of tbe association to put his
shoulder to the wheel at this juncture and
create public interest and enthusiasm in
behaif of tbe big drive.
â¢'I wish people would go out there and
look at the work being earned forward
there now on Seventh avenue. It would
do them good just to see it, and, besides,
it is a very pleasant streetcar ride. A.s I
have said, the idea is to continue the
drive from the Presidio, and, having com
pleted the road to the Trocadero, to
switch off near tbe Ingieside roadhouse
and ran almost due south to the County
line.
"I had a talk with an influential man
from Santa Ciara County to-day who said
that a movement is on foot there to build
a road up lrom San Jose to connect with
ours at the county line. It is a splendid
scheme, and should enlist the enthusiasm
of horsemen and people who like to drive,
as well as bicyclists and pedestr.ans. We
expect tho meeting on Tuesday evening
will be largely attended."
At the meeting an interesting report
was received of the big worK already ac
complished; how after lung and hard
work the opening was secured from tbe
park to Seventh avenue, and then, bloct
by block, Seventh^venUe was graded and
macadanvzed ; how tho Spring Valley
Water Company, after long persuasion,
has at last consented to the filling in of
its "waste park," which lay directly in the
way, and how the ocean Boulevard or the
great highway from Jbe cliff to the Ocean
house road was built â all forming v very
interesting report of well-directed and un
remitting effort toward securing a drive
way of which the City miiy be proud.

NOW FOR THE

Cosmos Club Dinner and
Entertainment To-
Night
Putting the Finishing Touches
to the Handsome New
Quarters.
Rich Furnishings in Which Solid
Comfort and Elegance Ars
Combined
There is to be a liousewnrminp; at tbe
new quarters of tbe Cosmos Club to night.
Tbe bouse will bo thrown open for the in
spection of members and friends. Fires
will glow upon tbe hearth, tbe scent of
spring blossoms will pervade tbe rooms
and 125 gentleman will gather at the table
to partake of the good cheer tbe bospitable
club offers them.
For the past two months workmen have
been busy converting the old Lake school
building, at the corner of Sutter and Oc
tavia streets, into this handsome, commo
dious, modern clubhouse. Nothing that
taste couid suggest, wealth command and
the love of comfort desire has been left
undone. The result is an ensembie of
solid elegance. There is not a superfluous
piece of furniture in the house; nothine
ornamental that may not at the same
time be converted into the useful. Tne
coloring of the interior is in ricii subdued
tones. Carpots and walls blend. Warm
terra cotta shades have certainly been the
favorites. They mingle with tne ex
quisite Japanese papering of ihe walls in
the lounging and billiard rooms and blend
harmoniously with the carpeting of these
apartments and the hail and reception
rooms as well.
The furnishings of these apartments are
for tiie most part in Russia leather. There
are great armchairs, the very look of
which suggests rest, couches, divans â yes,
and rockers. Then there are numberless
tables. Lurge, round, mahogany tables,
oblong tables, square tables, carved- wood
tables, and even the senseless little shelf
on four leg*, so clossiy identified with
"my lady's boudoir."
The dining-room and the adjoining
music-room, which can be thrown open
into one, are the most gorgeous apart
ments in the clubhouse. They are all
done in white and gold, and are the acme
of good taste and elegance. At the further
end of tne dining-room is a magnificent
mahogany sideboard, twenty feet long.
The (lining-hall, the music-hall, the
private dining-room and the great kitchen,
in which live white-capped cooks are kept
continually busy, are on the ground floor.
On the first floor are the reception-rooms,
the lounging-room, the billiard-hall, the
cardrooms and the big and little grill
rooms.
The two upper floors are given over en
tirely to the sleeping-rooms, thirty-one
in number. One fact of which Cosmos
members arÂ« very proud is that every
room is light and sunny. -
After the dinner to-night there is to be
a reception, for which 200 additional
guests have been invited. The c mmittee
of arrangements â Me-srs. J. E. Runcie,
J. P. Langhorne, William Tappenbeck, H.
R. Williar ana Andrew Carrigan. also
promise an entertainment, tne nature of
which they have kept a profound secret.
The officers of the Cosmos Club are:
W. B. Bradford, president; J. P. Lang

"Gentlemen : My name is William J. MeDer
mott, I am 45 years of age and a newspaper
man by profession. Having been crippled by
a gunshot wound of tbe foot, some of the
charge still remaining in tbe limb, my habits
were of the most sedentary k:mi. I soon be
came f fflieted with piles 01 a most aggravated
description, fciv digestion grew so impaired
that I could not retain lood upon my stomach,
and eating was a dreadâ sick headache and
nausea were constant, and in addition to these
ills I contracted rheumatism in its chronic
form. I was frequently compelled to take to
my bed with headache and sour stomach, my
(obd rising at such times as soon as swallowed,
and 1 suppose I should have remained in bed,
but notwithstanding mr misery I was com
pelled, being a poor man, to get up and earn
my living through sheer necessity.
"This was my condition for five years, so you
may suppose my life was one of "misery, for I
could get no relief from my ills, and I bad
â very little hope of recovery, having tried
every remedy in the whole pno.rmacopce.ia with
no betterment of my condition.
"Last March, by the advice of Dr. H. H. Sit
ser, I began to tnke Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
lor Pale People, following the directions faith
niiiy, aud almost immediately my headache
left me. I had not undergone the treatment
one week when my rheumaitsra grew decid
edly better, and gradually my stomach re
gained its tone and one by one my ailments
disappeared, until to-day, with the exception
of my lame foot, I am in sound bodily health,
and proud to acknowledge that I owe 1 his mar
velous change to Dr. Williams' Pink Piils.
â¢'I shall recommend Dr. Williams' medicine
heartily to tlie afflicted and have already
done so to many persona, among them being
Mrs. Anna George ot St. Croix, Perry County,

WANTED TO DIE.
Bliss Grace Gal imlo'a - Sensational At
...'.-, tempt to Take Her Life. /â  â . 'â 
' ' OAKLAND, Cal., :, March "':: 26.â Miss
Grace Gaiindo, a boarder at the Ellsworth
House, made a sensational attempt to- .
night to commit suicide. She was one of
a merry little company and was noticed
to be very /despondent.: About 10 o'clock
she went out into trie ball of the hotel and
swallowed four ounces of a .poisonous .
mixture. She. returned to the company
and was wishing them all good-by when
she went into convulsions. .
She said she had taken poison and was
anxious to die. Her friends sent for Dr.
0- L. Jones, and when he arrived the girl
was so violent that tbrse men were neces
sary to hold her. She fought and bit and
screamed, and said she did not wish to be
relieved of the poison, but eventually she
was overpowered, and by the aid of the
stomach-pump her life was saved. The
young lady is very low to-night, but Dr.
Jones says there is no doubt that she will
recover. : She is engaged to be married to
a man named Dicky, a theatrical adver
tiser, and it is thought she bad trouble
with â  him. ; J

:â Â£â¢ THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
The quickest Work that can be done on
the tariff bill will be the best work.
If yon wish good reading for to-morrow
leave orders for The Suvbay Call to-day.
The men who cry "peace, peace,'*- when
there is no peace are regarded in Europe
as preat diplomatists.
The Federal building movement has got
as far as the beginning of another test and
that makes work for somebody.
The drawback to having a plantation on
the Mississippi is that there is no telling
when the Mississippi may be on the plan
tation.
As Canada will also undertake a revision
of her tariff the thing seems to be con
tagious, but possibly it may prove as
healthy for her as for ns.
The Senate seoms. to regard the arbitra
tion treaty with sufficient 'avor at any
rate to hold on to it with a grip that ap
pears determined never to let go.
Before long the storm center between
Greece and Turkey may be shifted from
Crete to Tbessaly and then the war cioud
will be driven forward by a cyclone.
Considering his fondness for posing as
the arbiter of the destinies of Europe
Kaiser William is playine a very small
second riddle in the grand concert at
Crete.
As the keynotes of the year so far have
been piiched at Canton, Carson, Crete,
Cuba and Constantinople, it seems as if
the whole world has a desire to get the
high C tone to its concert.
As there has been no declaration of war
in Crete all the fighting has been illegal
and some Jnstice of the Peace in the isl
aDd ought to get out a warrant and arrest
the whoie shooting match.
It is encouraging to note the public in
terest in tiie boulevard displayed by the
increasing list of subscriptions to the con
struction fund. The work is going to be
one in which many a good citizen can say :
"I did my share."
Tie proposed boulevard along the
chores of Lake Michigan to connect Chi
cago and Milwaukee Is making rapid
prozress and will be the finest driveway
in tie United States until we construct
one round the southern end of the bay.
The manner in which King George of
Greece has held his position in Crete
againÂ«t the protests of the great powers
shows that he has brain as well as back
bone. He is evidently a King that knows
his business and understands his situ
ation.
The landing of 500 Highlanders at Crete
nearly roused the Moslems to madness,
and if they wore the regulation kilts the
rage of the populace is not to be wondered
at. The garo is fitted only to excite a
fight or a frolic and the Turk is not frolic
some just now.
It would be right endhgh to give mer
chants a chance to get rid of adulterated
foods which they may have on hand, pro
vided they get rid of them by returning
them to the wholesalers or manufacturers,
but they should not be permitted to un
load them on unsuspecting consumers.
Among the Congressmen from the
South who have spoken during the tariff
debate there have been almost as many in
favor of protection as against it. It will
be seen, therefore, that protection is
rapidly becoming a National sentiment as
well as a National policy and free trade is
fading out of sight.
Champ Clark of Missouri proposes to re
duce the expenditures of the country to
the revenues of the Wilson tariff by cut
ting the army down one-half and abolish
ing the diplomatic corps. The scheme i*
at any rate consistent from a Democratic
standpoint. If we are to have a deficit
tariff why not have a deficit Nation?
Th* duty levied on imported sugar by
the Dineley bill will be a tax upon the
people only so long as we import the
article. As fast as we advance in making
sugar for ourselves the tax will be light
ened and in the end it will be no tax at
all. In the meantime, moreover, it will
encourage American industry and give
our workingmen wages with which to pay
taxes.
Lord Salisbury has pone to France
ostensibly to attend the Queen, who is re
siding at Cimiez, but as he i% to stop at
Paris it is probable his real object is to ar
range a definite agreement with the
French Government as to joint action in
the Levant. The force of circumstances
is compelling the British and French to
act together whether they like It or not,
and on the other hand the much-talked-o;
Franco-Russian alliance seems to be ob
scured by the war cloud like sunshine by
a thunderstorm.
A new weekly has made its appearance
bearing the title The Yellow Dog, and is a
Ion;; way better than the title implies,
i >r it shows no snarling, nor any disposi
tion to be vicious. The tone of the wuoie
is humorous ami gives promise of avoid
ing that coarse satire which is the lait
refuse to decadent wit. The managers of
the new venture, N. J. Bowden and
Joseph Carll, have taken a path which
Jeads them into rivalry with no other
weekly in the City, and may possibly con
duct them to fortune.
SOUTHEM PROTECTIONISTS.
A conspicuous feature of the tariff de
bate in Congress lias been the course
taken by many Southern Democrats in
criticizing the bill, not because it is a
protective measure, but because it does
not give as much protection as they de
sire. Some of the most important speeches
in the debate thus far nave been of this
character, and they are sufficiently numer
ous to merit more than ordinary atten
tion.
In the debate on Tuesday, McLaurin of
South Carolina, a Democratic member of
the Ways and Means Committee, devoted
his speech on the bill almost exclusively
to a plea for protection for cotton-planters.
In the debate on Wednesday, Maddox of
Georgia asked for protection for alumi
num clay, which has been found in large
quantities in Georgia and Alabama. In
reply to a question as to whether he was
a protectionist, Maddox replied that he
was opposed to free raw material.
It is known that several of the ablest
Democrats from the South are strongly in
favor of protective duties not only upon
the articles stated by McLaurin and Mad
dox, but also upon iron, sugar, rice and
all other products ol the Southern States.
The intelligence of the South has at last
discerned the advantage cf protection to
industry, and while her leaders continue
to act with the Democratic party, they do
not permit their party discipline to go so
iar as to compel them to support a free
trade policy which has proven as disas
trous to the South as it has to the rest of
the country.
So long as no cotton was imported into
this country the cotton-planters were free
trader?. At the present time, however,
the importations of Egyptian cotton are
rapidly increasing and constitute a serious
menace to the product of the Southern
States in the American market. This
fact has taught the lesson of protection
against all the arguments of the free
traders, and the Southern cotton-planter
as well as the Southern manufacturer has
now joined the army of protection and
will assist in maintaining the protective
system as a permanent part of our indus
trial and commercial policy.
It is gratifying to note that the requests
of these Southern Democrats for protec
tion to Southern industries were well re
ceived by the Republicans of the House.
When Maddox objected to the Dingley
bill because the production of aluminum
clay wa3 not protected Dalzell of Pennsyl
vania said: "The gentleman from Georgia
should not be bo certain there will not be
a duty on that product. I favor it, and
we may yet place a duty on it." This
statement was greeted with applause from
the Republican side of the House. The
incident clearly showed the intent of thu
Republican party to provide protection
for all American industries, wittiout re
gard to section or to party. Southern
Democrats will find as cordial a welcome
in the temple ot protection as will men of
any other party or of any other section.
A QUEEN'S AMBITION.
It is brave news that Santa Cruz has
authorized The Call's correspondent to
flash before the gaza of the world. In a
two-column dispatch from there which
The Call published yesterday morning
the claim is valiantly asserted that the
people down that way are not content
with mereiy having one of the mosc de
lightful pleasure resorts in the world.
The fact that nature has endowed their
little dale by the sea with advantages
which nothing within the power ol the
world could duplicate or equal is duly ap
preciated by them, but it does not prove
to be a couch sufficiently soft to tempt
Ambition to lia down upon it and rest.
Past it, with merely a lingering glance of
satisfaction, it goes, and ultimately re
solves into a conviction that Santa Cruz
is fitted to be even more than nature has
fashioned her, notwithstanding that na
ture has adorned her so far above the
average of her sister cities.
Santa Cruz assens that she can be a self-.
reliant commercial factor as well as a
pleasure resort. Mani estly the office of
pleasure resort is by far superior to that of
commercial center. Certainly it is rarer,
more attractive and withal more bene
ficial to the higher elements of humanity.
Yet, holding a position which nearly
every other community ia the world
might envy, this energetic Santa Cruz
confidently assures us that a queen may
become a saleslady and still retain the
royal heritage and perquisites of her
birth !
It is a redoubtable declaration. It is
very rarely that one sees a particularly
favored spot for recreation made into a
successful commercial mart. Nor does it
often happen that the inhabitants of a
particularly favored pleasure resort desire
to exploit in other direction?, whereon
they commonly look down wit.i lofty
superiority and complacent security.
Whether one is wise in doing so remains
for Santa Cruz to determine. One thing
alone is clear to us less fortunate burgs :
if Providence had only been as kind to us
as it has been to Santa Cruz we should
hesitate to desire anything further, es
pecially anything less valuable than the
things which we already possessed.
For selfish reasons alone caution is nec
essary for our versatile little sister city to
observe. Will society, which now in
cludes Santa Cruz as one of its summer
pets and makes much of it every year,
continue to smile upon it if commerce,
in tho shape of hurrying drays, tram cars,
vegetable wagons and cattle trains, in
trudes upon the sylvan repose which now
prevails? Will commerce harmonize with
the beautiful cliff drive, the beach, the
quiet, pretty streets? Santa Cruz, yon
see, is all in a bunch, so to speak â is
right up next to the ocean, wheuce es
cape is rendered impossible by the encir
cling hills crowding up to the rear of it.
The area is too small to accommodate con
flicting pursuits. What the town is in
one place it is in all places, or all over.
And it is all over au ideal spot to drift
into for enjoyment.
If some friendly advice be permissible,
we would venture to suggest tbat Santa
Cruz eive not too much thought to com
mercial development. Rather expend her
surplus energies in adorning, with such
touches as man may add to nature's won
derwork, the rare features which make
her so attractive and so celebrated within
the pleasure-seeker's ken. In that lies her
province, and where could a more glorious
province be realized ?
WAR IN GBEEOE.
After the Servian war the Greet army
was increased and now is about the size of
our own. Universal liability to service
exists, though the regular army is re
cruited by lot.
By th- law of 1887 the regular army of
Greece has a total of 24.076 officers and
men, comprisinj; 16,136 infantry, 4377
cavalry and 30G3 artillery and engineers.
Th- total length of service is twelve years,
of which three are passed in the line,
three in the first reserve and ?ix in the
second, On a war footing the regular
army could be raised to 100,000 men. The
first reserve would give 104,500 men and
the second reserve, or territorial army.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. MARCH 27, 1897.
aDout 145,000 more, making a grand total
of 350,000 men.
In considering the military situation of
Greece, her varied topography must be
taken into full account. The country is
much broken and divided by mountains
into a number of independent posts. Such
a country is, liKe Switzerland, best adapted
for a defensive warfare. History teems
with successful defenses of states so situ
ated. To become master of such a coun
try each separate post must be conquered
independently, so that a prolonged de
fense is easily made.
Though the country is fairly provided
with highways, the absence of any but
short local lines of railway will make the
problem of invasion a difficult one. Ade
quate railway facilities are absolutely
essential to the supply and moving of
large modern armies. This alone must
limit the force 3 which can be brought
against her. If Greece is forced to defend
herself we may confidently anticipate
that she will make a brave fisht, with the
chances in her favor. The stronjr local
patriotism and love of country, so marked
a characteristic of ancient Greece, she
sÂ»ill possesses. Sue ia to-day tho most
democratic country in Europe.
Great battles require an adequate thea
ter of operations, for the battle itself is
but the culminating point of a long
series of operations. Such a theater
is lacking in Greece. If war comes
we may loo;; there for a partisan and
localized series of conflicts rather than
those grand operations which are possible
only in a comparatively open country
having ample communications.
SAN TfiANOISOO'S RAPID OEOWDS
A leisurely person with an observant
eye and a mind given over to rumination
may station himself on any one of San
Francisco's prominent thoroughfares nnd
be led into tome interesting reflections by
simply marking the speed with which the
passing throngs go by him.
There is a great deal in this speed. It
means more thau rapid traveling up and
down the street. And the significance of
it is confined to San Francisco no more
than is the habit of speed itself, which is
a pedestrianic characteristic of the entire
country, if not of the entire civilized
world.
One must at first experience mild won
der at ttie haste which his sisters and
brothers display in going by him as he
stands under the protection of a doorway
and gazes out upon them. Everybody ap
pears to be in a most important hurry.
Every face indicates a consuming deter
mination to "get there" in the shortest
possible space of time. So rigid are the
countenances set in this unalterable pur
pose, that even tha manners of their own
ers generally fail to assert themselves
when the exigencies of personal encoun
ters or collisions occur to warrant it; none
of the conventions of the drawing-room
prevail to divert our pedestrians from tha
one inveterate aim of annihilating space.
Jostling and crowding, albeit sp:ced with
smothered profanity or inaudible thoughts
which ill become brother travelers, are the
rule.
But after a moment's reflection one per
ceives that in this regardless expense of
speed lies the cause of the Nation's, or
mayhap of the human race's, progress.'
As moves the individual in his intention
to accomplish his certain little plan or bit
of business, so moves the composite man,
the community, the practical world. The
individual is always characteristic of the
multitude â his trays, in the average, are
always synonymous with the definite re
sults of his community's ways, as evi
denced in all the perfections and achieve
ments of what we call modern inventions,
or modern improvements. And in this
respect of speedy traveling along the
streets, the individual man's relation to
the age of progress in which he pursues
his way is strikingly brought out.
One might demand a reason for so much
haste, and deny that it is essentially char
acteristic of the Nation's advancement, on
the ground that a man might start earlier
for his plac? of business and walk slower.
Indeed he might. He might spend fewer
moments over his morning pipe, or cut
short his leisure time with baby in the
back parlor, or he might in a hundred
logical and convenient ways get started in
good lime, instead of always late, to his
office. And so, indeed, might the ducks
out in Golden Gate Park walk about on
the lawn all the while and never go into
the water.
Our San Francisco crowds are human,
and it is natural for a human individual
to set the pace for the progress of his race.
Hose sit by walking fast, and his race
corresponds with rapid strides in modern
advancement. Wherefore let no man
swear at the "madding crowds." They
verily are mad in their nights, but so is
civilization in its flight of invention, pene
tration and achievement.
LET IT BE COMMENCED.
The fact that the Federal authorities
have again suffered their attention to be
directed to San Francisco's postofflce site
is cheering, inasmuch as it foreshadows a
possible utilization thereof in the future,
and that would be a tolerably fair thing to
happen to it.
The Call arrived at this conclusion
some time ago, only a few days after the
general public had assured itself that It
had been mistaken in supposing that the
site was meant to have a building put up
on it, and our conviction found expression
In these columns several days since. The
result is that the authorities aforesaid are
again testing the famous ground, with an
encouraging significance.
Congressman Loud opines that work on
the new postoffice will be commenced dur
ing the coming summer. The money
necessary for an effective beginning nas
been duly appropriated and now lies in
the treasury awaiting the contractor's
call. Congress will appropriate adequate
sums as the work progresses, as provided
for in the original resolution. Only let us
get started, and that site will assume a
more real aspect in the eyes of a hitherto
baffled community.

Chauncey M. Depew on Trusts.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sir: Probably there is no eminent American who has to uni
vcrsally impressed his geniality upon his countrymen as Chauncey M. Depew. For many
yesrs I have admired his phenomenal versatility, his mastery of speech, his ever-ready wit, his
gyrating fancy, his shrewd penetration and his prodigious attainments. I rate him among
the ablest men of our times, and the position he has held over thirty years as counsel and
president of the Vanderbilt system of railroad*, and as counsel and attorney for the Vander
bilts, lends confirmation to my estimate. We may well luten when he speaks.
In a recent interview with the New York Herald on wealth. Inventions, trusts, and the
duties of wealthy men, he answered the question. "What is the danger of trusts?" I ask
readers of The Call to consider his words. Ho said: "Undoubtedly the combinations of
capital in what are commonly called trusts, so far as they crusn out competition and enable a
few men to fix the price of the necessaries of life, require the most careiul supervision by the
Government and the Siat*, and the most rigid legislation for their control ; but the dangers
anticipated from tne universal combination of every kind of business into trusts are greatly
exaggerated." When he speaks ot "the universal combination of every kind of business into
trusts," he points to a condition soon to be realized and regards it with complacency.
As a remedy for any possib c evils of a universal system of trusts which will "enable a few
men to fix the price of the necessaries of life," Mr. Depew proposes "rigid legislation for their
control." Let the reader rest easy on this plan and indulge in no misgivings as to "rigid leg
islation," for Mr. Depew assures us that "legislators grow belter all the while." "In other
wonis, the world is improving all the time," and "walth has infinitely leÃ3 influence in legis
lation, and a healthy public opinion and publicity have practicaUy destroyed corruption."
This will be gra Hying information for most reader?, certainly, since the impression seems to
prevail among all clxsses of people that wealth has great influence over legislation and that
"corruption" is not "practically destroyed."
While reading these views of Mr. Depew last evening I sat smoking my cigar by a cory
open fire and indulged in some reflections, which I thought it worth while to offer to the
readers ot The < all. but I have cnanged my purpose. On rending one of the morning news
papers to-day I was confronted in large headlines with the announcement of "Harrison's Vo:ce
Against Corporations," and further examination disclosed the information that "on Tuesday,
March 23, ex-President Hnrrison delivered before the Ann Arbor University, Michigan, a
remarkable address," in which, he declares exactly opposite views from those held by Mr.
Depew, couched, it is true, in very guarded phraseology, bat nevertheless decided and
emphatic.
In the third paragraph be says: "I take these two subjects â corporation and tax law
reformâ aÂ« illustrations of the inefficiency of the legislative methods. Corporations have
multiplied greatly. We now have them engaged in conducting no: only railroads and banks,
but almost every form of manufacturing or mercantile adventure. The investors, managers
an<l employes Interested are found everywhere. Th*y are individuals of more than the average
influence, especially when stirred into activity by a lar.-e personal interest. This influence will
clearly be thrown against any unjust or destructUe legislation, and very much of it against
anyjre'stricti vp legislation. In fighting unjust legislation they will have many ailies who are
disinterested."
On finding ex-President Harrison thus opposed to the roseate views of Mr. Depew I shall
let him speak for me. Referring to Mr. Depew's own State General Harrison avers that "sc
cordine to the last annual roport of Controller Roberts in the State of New York the equalized
taxable value of real esiate in 1895wasnearly$4,0OO.0O0,O0O; that of personal property lessthan
half a billion. And yet it is well known that tne personal property in New lork State is equal
to If not greater than the amount of real estate." From this nate of things lam led to infer
that wealth still has considerable influence and that "corruption" is not yet "practically de
stroyed" in New York.
It would seem that General Harrison has reached the same conclusion, for he immediately
asserts that "n way must be devised to place corporations under proper restraint and to bring
to the taxroll the vast aggregate of untaxed personal property. The executive and judicial
forces of the Government act quickly and directly. The legislative forces, hampered by the
conditions surrounding them and the greater complications of the questions before them, seem
to be inadequate." If "the legislative forces seem to be inadequate to place corporations
under proper restraiut," and I agree with General Harrison that they are inadequate, then I
fear that "the rigid legislation for their control" proposed by Dr. Depew maybe one of his
jokes after nil.
Indeed, General Harrison himself despairs of "the legislative forces" and proposes a resort
to a new method of procedure, which he states thus: "It seems to me that the great reform
laws must be framed by commissions composed of the brightest minds in the States. They
must hÂ«vo time to study thoroughly the subject. Opportunity must be given to the interests
to be aff.-cted and to the public to present suggestions and objections. There shou<d bi no at
tempt 10 bring in tho millennium on the morrow. It would be too sudden." When the com
missions have framed the laws it is presumed that they will be presented to the Legislature for
enactment, and thus in the end we muÃt deal with "the legislative forces," for 1 do not sus
pect General Harrison of the Populistic heresy of referring tneni directly to those who are to
be governed by these lawsâ the whole body of el'-ctors. If the new method proposed by the
ox-President i< little better than the present method â is in fact only traveling in a "vicious
circle"â ne h^s given a sufficient answer, at all events, to our genial optimist, Dr. Depew.
I fear that both General Harrison and Dr. Der>ew are unwittingly givinsr testimony to the
wisdom of the Populist contention that trusts Lave no right to exist and fix prices fnr a single
day. JOSEPH ASBURY JOHNSON.

The Devil and the Deep Seaâ W. H. City.
The origin of tne phrase -'Between the devil
and the deep sea" is not certain. Ii has been
traced back to 1637 In a work printed in Lon
don bearing the title "Expedition With Mac
kay's Regiment." That regiment was with the
army of Uustav Adoipb, and c gaged m bat
tle with the Ausuians. The Swedish gunners
failed to elevate their guns proper iy. so their
snot fell into tne ranks of iheir ahies. The
Scotch regiment, with the enemy on one side
Â»nd the bundering gunners on the other, says
the writer of the oook. "were between the
devil and the deep sea." It is thought that
the expression had been uted before that
time. __
Belligerent Rightsâ C. C, Ross Valley, Ma
rin County, Cat. England did rec gnize tho
Southern Confederacy as a belligerent with
equal rights to supplies and hospitality guar
anteed by such recognition. That cave to the
Confederate States tacllitles and opportunities
which were energetically used. The question
of recognizing a body of people at war with
another is settled by a proclamation which
recognizes the belligerency of the people
claiming belligerent rights. This was the case
when England recognized the Southern Cen
federacv. Queen Victoria issued the procla
mation. The expediency of sucn an act must
be governed by the serioU!>ne>B of the strug
gle. The tesi is whether an absolute state oi
hostility existsâ not tr.fl.ng or localized, but,
serious enough to affect the interests of the
other States. It bec< mes to a certain extent a
question of probability, while the recognition
of independence involves purely a question of
lactâ whether the attempt ot the parent state
to coerce its rebellious member has ceasea.
"The recognition of belligerency," says
Theodore a Woolsey. a well-known writer
on international law, "is by no means one
sided in its operation. It gives rights to both
combatants. To the insurgent it gives tho
right ol belligerents, the recognition of its flag,
a rignt to raise loans, s quasi political status
without diplomatic standing. On the other
hand the parent state can no longer be held
responsible tor the rebellious acts of its re
bellious subjects. It cau emp.oy the rights of
blockade, of capture for carrying contraband,
of search against its enemies, thus affecting
neutral commerce. In fact, all parties recog
nize as a fact that a war exists between two
combatants, the question of independence be
ing yet in aoeyance. Judged by these teits
the recognition ot the Southern Confederacy
by Great Britain and Frauce in 186 1 was
proper and necessary, but the recognition of
its independence was at no time justifiable."
England did not recognize tuts Independ
ence oi the Southern Confed racy. Unless
England had recognized the independence of
the States Â«he could not have sent "vessels
loaded with ammunition to the Southern Con
fedeiacy." Her proclamation of the belliger
ency gave the Uuiied States the right to
blockade Southern purls and to search neu
tral vessels. There were a number of English
vesse.s not under authority of the English
Government that carrk-d arms and supplies to
the Soutnern ports, and a number ot them
were captured lor Carrying contrabands of
war. Tne Confederate Government passed a
law directing all Englisn vessel* entering it*
lor is to bring arms and supplies, else they
would not be admitted. This deoartinent is
unable to discover how many British steam
ers tried to or made a lauding at Southern
ports during the war.

The Clippers Santiago and Marie Hackfeld Making Port Last Thursday Night. Both Vessels Sailed In and Were Followed Yesterday by Four More of the Sugar
Fleet. All the Boats Mads Good Time, the Santiago Making the Run in Fourteen Days.

Nearly Forty Vessels
Passed In and Out in
One Day.
Half a Dozen of Them Were
Sugar Laden From
Honoulu.
Accidents and Loss of Life Reported
From a Number of Other
Vessels.
The Golden Gate was one of the busiest
ports in ttfe United States yesterday. A
dozen coasters and steam \esseis made
port and six sugar-boats got in from Ha
waii, wnile a number of vessels came in J
from Australia and South Sea island
ports.
All the vessels from Hawaii made quick
passages. The Santiago made the quick
est run of tbe fleet, arriving hero last
Thursday night in the fast time of four
teen days. Tbe bark S. C. Allen made
the run from Honomlu in sixteen days
and the barkentine F.anter from Kahului
in sixteen days, while the barkentine
George C. Perkins took twenty days to
come from Mabukona, the Meiba Nelson
nineteen days to come from Kahului and
tbe Mario Hackfeld eighteen days to come
from Honolulu. All the sugar-boats bad
fair weather and every one of them sailed
in. Consequently tbe captains ol tbe va
rious tugs that were outside looking lor a
job were more than angry when they saw
tbe vessels sailing by them under fu 1 sail.
The Metha Nelson when she entered
port completed ber first round trip. She
was built a year ago in Mendocino and
was named after the wife of Captain Net
son. A few days after the schooner left
port for Hawaii Mrs. Nelson died, and con
sequently tbe return of the vessel is a sad
reminder to the owner of the schooner.

danger.
The battle-ship Oregon also had trouble
with ber anchors. When ready for sea
one of them fouled and the big fighting
machine went adrift. The tide carried her
down toward the Camanche, and it looked
as though tbe old-timo monitor was
doomed. Luckily tbe battle-ship's sec
ond anchor beid and all was well. After
tbs tangies were got out of the port chains
and the starboard anchor was hauled up
again the Oregon proceeded to adjust her
compasses-.

CHITA WAS ROMANCING.
Absurdity of the Sensational
Durrant Fake Exposed by
the PoliC3.
Captain Lees Declares Eh Do*s Not
Believe th.3 Jack-on Woman's
S ory Concerning Ware.
The atory that Eugene Ware, the drug
clerk, was murdered by Theodore Dur
rant, was not of sufficieut prooability to
find many believers when it was new, and
now, after iis foundation has been com
pletely annihilated by police investiga
tion, Captain Lees is emphatic in bis as
sertion that, its reiteration is absurd.
The woman upon whose statement the
ptorv was originally based is known as
Chita Jackson. Her reputation is de
scribed by the police as unsavory, and
their judgment is backed ur> by one or two
incarcerations for minor offenses.
Chita Jackson furnished the police
with a statement concerning an incident
which sue had seer, in the Si. Nicholas
Pharmacy the night of the murder. This
statement, which was made snortly after
Ware's dead body was discovered, has
nothing in it to point to the" complicity
of Durrant in the murder. This statement
was to the effect that she had seen a
woman enter the drugstore and speak to
Ware. She referred to some party 'whom
she promised to shake." The Jackson
woman then saw Ware's iady friend leave
the drugstore and meet a man who spoke
sharply to her and was answered in kind.
The description she gave ol the man
was that he was 25 or 30 years of age, 5
feet 9 inches tall, well built, smooth face;
jf mustache, light. Not one of the details
of the description fit 3 Durrant. The de
scription of the woman was equally inap
plicable lo Minnie Williams.
Captain Lees had the story of Chita
Jackson thoroughly investigated, ana he
expressed the opinion that not only is the
Durrant theory a fallacy, but that Chita
Jackson in all probability was not near
the pharmacy on the night in question.

VINING AND THE
MAYOR CONFER
Talked Over the Subject of
Unused Streetcar
Tracks.
The Position of the City in This
Important Matter Clearly
Defined.
Another Conference to Be Held After
tin Superintendent Has Talked
With Superiors.
At Mayor Phelan's invitation E. P. Vin
ing, general manager of the Market-street
Company, called on the City's chief ex
ecutive yesterday to discuss the proposi
tion of removing all of tbe unused street
car tracks within the llmiis of this City.
Mr. Vining has control of all of the lines
belonging to the big street railway cor
poration and tbe majority of the tracks
objected to by the Mayor come under his
supervision. The meeting was in the
nature of a conference to give each side an
idea of the position assumed by tlie other.
Mayor Pbelan told Mr. Vining very
plainly that as he understood the law tbe
Market-street Company bad no right to
maintain idle tracks that cumbered the
streets, obstructed traffic and .Hindered
improvements. Tbe franchises that per-'
mitted the company to lay ibe tracks con
templated that they should be kept in
active service.
He thought that if the company was
not goinz to use tbe miles of lHe tracks,
tbe location of which had been shown by
the Superintendent of Streets, he should
consent to their abandonment and have
them tnken up at once.
Mr. Vining replied that in a large ma
jority of cases the company had no inten
tion of abandoning the right to use tracks,
and intimated that if the City attempted
to cause them to be torn up, as in the
case of Stockton street, the corporation
would take legal means to prevent any
such measures.
He stated, however, that he could give
no decilert ansner to the requests of the
Mayor until he had consulted the presi
dent of the company and other officials.
It was arraneed that Mayor Phelan
should furnish Mr. Vining with a list of
HEW TO-DAT.

WANT GREATER LIMITS.
Property-Owners Protest Against the
Present Size of the Area in Which
Cows Roam.
The Health and Police Committee of
the Board of Supervisors listened to a
variety of arguments on the question of
pound limits yesterday, but Tailed to reach
any conclusion in tbe matter.
A delegation of property-owners from
outside districts headed by Geor.-e W.
Haisht declared there was good reason
why the limits should be extended, be
cause of the bands of cows that roam
about thickly populated sections and
destroy improvements as well as endan
gering the lives and limbs of suburban
residents. They stated that the progress
of the western portion of the City is bein*
seriously retarded by the present con
ditions.
The milkmen were also represented and
asked for a short stay of proceedings to
allow them to produce evidence that their
stock is not a menace to property interests.
The matter went over for three weeks.
CONTEST OF MRS. TOY'S WILL.
Morgan S. Toy Says the Instrument
Was l.evoked. -
A contest to the probate of the will of
Harriet Toy has been riled by Morgan S,
Toy, son of the decedent. The contestant
alleges that the paper tiled by Daniel H.
Haskell aiid L. J. Cnipnian, and by them
asserted to be Mrs. Toy's last will, is not,
in fact, her will, for the reason that after
it was made on the 29th of March, 1890,
she revoked the same. V .
The estate consists principally of landed
property in this City ana San Jose. A
cause for : the contest : may be gathered
from the following clause, in;, the will,
where the testator, after < setting forth the
pieces of property bequeathed to her son
Morgan, says: "I hereby forgive and re
lease him of all loans made by me to him,
and I declare that I have treated the same
as advances, and that is why I give him
less that his sisters in this will."

pending. According to an order filed yester
day Mrs. Sykes is to have the custody of the
children from 9 o'clock Saturday morning to
9 o'clock Monday morning of each week, and
Mr Sykes is to care for them during the re
mainder of the time until after the case is dis

J. T. CLARK HAS FAILED
The Furniture-Dealer Is Unable
to Meet His Obliga
tions.
Several Lirgo Attachments Placed
on His Store Yesterday â Cred
itors to Meet
The financial difficulties of J. T. Clark,
the furniture and carpet dealer of 1133
Market street, culminated yesterday in
attachments aggregating several thousand
dollars being placed on his stock by
impatient creditors, and the indications
are that he will be forced into insolvency.
Several days ago he was attached for
about $200, but it was not known that he
was in serious straits until yesterday,
when J. J. Itauer, representing the Provo
Woolen-mills, took out a second at
tachment for a considerable amount.
Within a lew hours more attachments,
aggregating $2000, were sued out, and at a
late hour the claim of J. Baumgartner &
Co. of $1000 was recorded at the Sheriff's
office.
Clark's heaviest creditor is said to be
Smith & Co., to whom he owes $3000. The
total amount of the debts of the concern
is staid to be between $ 12.000 and $14,000.
A meeting of the creditors is to be held
within a tew days, when the question of
allowing Clark to continue or winding up
the affairs of the hocse will be discussed.
Clark claims that slow collections and
business depression are responsible for
his present troubles and that if he is
given time to straighten out his affairs he
will come out all right.
He will have a, full statement of the
condition of his business ready for the
creditors when they meet. In the mean
time the Sheriff is in charge of the place.

THE SPORTSMAN'S NICHE.
Australian Baseball Team Will Soon Be Here.
The Rod, Glove, Rifle and Bat
The National came of America is now
on a solid footing.
Baseball clubs, mushroom like, are
springing up in all directions, and people
who have a prediieciion for good athletic
contests will show their appreciation by
supporting the game s as long as the play
ers will put up good ball. The Australian
baseball players will soon invade this
Cit>, and their arrival will certainly give
a great Impetus to the game. Indeed, the
future of baseball on this coast is seem
ingly brighter than ever, and the players
should not forget that well - coutesied
games will attract thousands of sport
lovers to the parks.
The oarsmen are also moving to the
front. A lively interest in aquatics per
vades the boat clubs, and indications
â¢noint to a very successful summer along
the front.
The anglers are getting ready for the
opening of the trout season, which will
be on April 1. Sportsmen are enjoying
themselves at the traps, and the lovers of
rifle-shooting, coursing, handball, lawn
tennis, etc., are by no means behind in the
race for t>lea?urc.
THE WHEELMEN.
The Indoor Tournament, the An
nual Relay Race and the Sunday
Racing Question.
The indoor cycle tournament that has
been in progress this week and will con
tinue next week at the Mechanics' Pavil
ion is the sole topic of interest among the
wheelmen here just at present. For the
time being everything else seems to be put
in the background. Oue hears a hitle
FRED J. LOUGHEAD, the Canadian Champion, Who Is Racing
at the Pavilfon Indoor Tournament.
talK about the big interclub relay race to
be run around the bay on Sunday, April 4,
and many riders are in training for it, but
it is not talked about as it was a week pre
vious to the one last year for the reason
that the indoor meet is absorbing all the
attention.
This indoor meet is by long odds the
best ever held here, nnd I question if we
have /ever seen better racing even on
larger trucks. Perhaps the high class of
the riders entered in the different events
accounts for this in a measure. A fast
track, good prizes and good management
have also done their share.
To-morrow a number of tbe local clubs
will hold "try-outs" over the Frnitvale-
Haywards course, the purpose being to
judge the speed of their men and select
the fastest for the relay teams. The make
up of the different teams will be known
by next Tuesday or Wednesday.
A regular meeting of the Associated
Clubs will be held next Saturday evening,
April 3, at the rooms ol the Imperial Cyc
ling Club, fil4 Van Ness avenue, tonliscuss
relay matters and the proposition of ad
mitting individuals to membership and
taking charge of track racing on the Pacific
Coast.
The following interesting letter has been
received by me on the subject of Sunday
racing, and is worthy of reproduction in
this column. It is from a gentleman who
has been a member of the league and of
this division for a number of years. He
says:
Keports of the recent National assembly of
delegates. League of American Wheslinen, at
Albany, N. Y.,show that the majority declined
10 leave the matter of Sunday racing to the
State divisions. Their action seems to nave
been controlled by much the sarce processes
ttiat moved thelnquisition when it condemned
Galileo to jail ior .-aying that the earth re
volved arouna the sun.
Considering the wide difference of opinion
about Sunday, the vote was arbitrary to say
the least It amounts to dictating "on a re
ligious question, regarding which three of
the churches, viz.: the Roman Catholic,
Beventh-day Baptist. and Seventh-day Advcnt
ist, wholly deny that the Scriptures raaKe or
authorize a transier of tne sanctificatlon from
Saturday to Sundnyl History shows that the
change was ordered by tho Pope of Rome In
the fourth century, and for more than 100
years it was not fully acquiesced In by all
Christendom, many observing the seventh
day despite tne weight of ti:e papal edict.
Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore has repeat
edly declared that there is no authority in
{Scripture for keeping .Sunday holy, the sole
basis for it being the Pope's power to make
chances in the divine law.
Father EnriÃht, a Catholic priest in charge
of the Redemptorist College at Kansas City.
Mo., publicly offered some years ago to Day
$1000 to any one who could prove to him by
the Scriptures that Sunday wns a holy day.
It is entirely a Catholic institution, yet the
church of Koine makes no objection to popular
amusements on this day.
Tiie assembly's vote is not calculated to pro
mote the harmony so vital to the continued
Bucc'r-cs and uselulnessol the League of Amer
ican Wheelmen.
Robert M. Welch, the member of last
year's league racing board resident in this
City, was the recipient during this week
of a beautiful emblem studded with dia
monds, sent by Chairman Gideon to each
of the gentlemen associated with him on
the racing board, in token of his apprecia
tion of their valuable services. Mr. Welch
is very proud of it. and the remembrance
was certainly very complimentary and
richly deserved. Spalding.
THE GUN.
Shooting: Wild Geese Near Elrr.lra.
Smashing Inanimate Tar
gets.
The latest addition to the clubs which
have been organized for the sole purpose
of smashing c!ay bird* tiurine ttic season
when game )3 protected by law is the
South-end Gun Club, which will make its
tirst appeasanca be;oro the traps at Colma
to-ruorrow lorenoon. According to the
programme there will be five races â viz:
Two ten-bird, two twenty-bird and one
fifteen bird, with prizes divided. Ln class
shooting all ties wi:l be divided. To-mor
row the Empire Gun Club will smash blue
rocks at Alameda Point; the Reliance
Gun Club will pulverize the inanimates at
the Webster-street grounds and the Olym
pic Gun Club will iry live birds for a
change at Ingleside. On April 4 the Enci
nal Club will shoot at Birds Point, the
California Wing Club at Ingleside and the
Lincoln at Alaraecia Point.
A. W. Stuart of Main Prairie writes that
any lover of shooting who is desirous of
good sport should not miss the opportu
nity that now presents itself lor the
slaughter of aild geese b 'tween the rail
road station at Elmira and the town of
Main Prairie, on the head of Cash Slough.
The writer say 3 that the geese are now
wending their way toward the north, and
that it is no trick to kill 100 birds in a
morning's sport.
An English exchange says that the
King of Greece is one of the most active
and popular of the sovereigns of Europe.
It is "early to bed and early to rise" with
him. Business over, he enjoys outdoor
exercise and all Kinds of sport. HÂ« is a
good shot and whip, a line swimmer and
a great angler. At his summer residence
at Corfu he tnrr.a farmer, while his wife
becomes â * musician and painter. The
I Kine, who is a handsome and very
I genial monarch, has been on the throne
of Greece since his eighteenth year.
THE ANGLER.
Good Prospects for the Opening of
the Trout - Fishlnsr
SÂ«a6on.
The anglers are looking pleasantly for
ward to April 1, which will be the open
ing day of the trout-fishing season.
The weather during the past lew weeks
has been mo<t favorable to the sport
which will be enjoyed by many fond lovers
of the gen' le pastime next month.
Last year, it will be remembered, very
heavy rains fell in March, which swept
the small fishes to the sea and the large
fish did not remain either on the erder of
going, but left before the creeks assumed
anything like their spring appearance.
The result was that in April, when the
streams ran clear of all refuse matter,
there was verylittie sport to be had in the
creeks w hich are within an easy distance
of this City.
The weather conditions are snch this
year that the outlook lor good fishing next
month is very promisiag. provided that
the poachers who fish at all seasons of the
year have not cleaned the streams of their
inhabitants before the law-abiding citizen
cas'.s his line.
It is said that the Sonoma Creek is being
fished daily and that the Constables of
Sonoma will not interfere. So long as
this order of affairs continues it can hardly
be expected that the fishing will be up to
the mark when the season opens. But
there are several very excellent creeks in
Sonoma and Mendocino counties which
will nfford erand sport to the angling fra
ternity next month.
Between Cloverdale and Ukiab there
are several beautiful streams which should
not be forgotten by the sportsmen who
contemplate an outing on the Ist. The
Big Sulphur, near Cloverdale, is always a
good stream in the early and late months
of the reason.
Lnst Sunday the anglers who viÂ«ited
Point Reyes enjoyed splendid sport. Eight
or nine large fi>h thai were returning from
the breeding' grounds fell victims to the
led fly and shrimp.
John Butlei was among the crowd that
lined the banks of the stream, and he
offered a reward of some kind to the angler
who by some hook or crook would catch a
Jarpe steelhead which he had landed tho
Sunday previous, and which leaped back
a<rain into the water the inttant it saw
butler's face.
"I don't care so much about the fish,"
said Buller, "if I can only get my 'goff,'
which was stuck in the steelhead when it
flopped overboard."
Butler, Gallagher, Colonel Munroe of
Eureka and Senator Sidney Hall of this
City are now at Point Reyes on a pros
pecting tour for the fish that never re
turned, and which has been dubbed by
Count Bransdorff Salmo Butlereno.
THE OARSMEN.
The South Ends' Handball Court
Nearlngr Comple
tion.
At the last meeting of tbe South End
Rowing Clnb Joe Lyons was admitted to
membership. Mr. Lyons is an experi
enced oarsman and intends to enter the
junior skiff race at the next regatta. The
name of William McGeorge was proposed
for membership by President Scully.
Secretary Erecn and Captain Thomas
are exerting every effort to collect back
dues from the delinquent members in
order that the work on the handball
court will continue. By next meeting
they hope to collect about $100, and if suc
cessful tbe court will be completed about
the Ist of May. when a grand tournament
will be given, in which all the prominent
players on the coast will compete.
Will Fox, a new member of the club,
was out ior t c first time In a barge on
last Sunday morning and rowed like an
old-timer and displayed his endurance by
rowing over the three-mile course without
a stop.
K'Hi.'h water and wind does not seem to
annoy Dr. Dennis and Jim Foley, as every
evening botn of these gentlemen can be
seen pullinga^ninst tide and wind between
the boattiouae and Hunter* Point. Dr.
Dennis will make another effort to win
t/ie senior championship, while Mr. Foley
will try to break the coast record in the
fat men's race. This record is now held
by Joseph O'Dea.
The members of the club are thinking
seriously of presenting Archie Campbell
and Frank Burke with a leather medal
for their heroic efforts in saving Tom
Lynch from a watery grave, and for this
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 27, 1897.
purpose a collection will be taken up at
the next meeting.
Much credit is due to Joseph Foley, the
manager of the taseball team, for his wise
judgment in seiecintr players. Asa result
ttie score at the end of the fourth inning
stood 42 to 9in favor of the South Ends.
It was here that the Dolphins thought it
better to submit to the inevitable and in
vited the heavy hitters from the foot of
Third street to partake of the French din

The following is a copy of a letter mailed
on March 18 for pnbl cation to the Phila
delphia Sporting Referee and St. Louis
Sporting-News by A. G. Spalding, who
will manage the Australian baseball team :
Jam just in receipt of information that a
team oi baseball players sailed from Sydney,
Australia, on the Monowai on Monday, the
15th of March. Their intention is to make a
tour of this country, possibly extending the
same to England and around the globe to their
home. They will be under the management
and guidance of Harry Musgrove, one of the
leading theatrical managers of Australasia,
who so successfully managed the tour oi tho
Australiau cricketers around the world last
year. ,
Recalling the visit of the Chicago -AH
America teams to Australia in 1888, would
say that the peopie of Australia seemed to vie
with each other ip. adding to the pleasure of
the party both individually and collectively.
Our players were received with ceremonies by
the public officials wherever they went. They
were tendered twenty-eight banquets and pub
lic receptions during the twenty-four days of
their stay iv that country. They were lion
ized, feted and entertained in a way that has
not been excelled or equaled before or since
in any country. Any player who was a mem
ber ot that fortunate party will bear witness
'hat what I have said is not a-n exaggeration.
I feel now as I did then that the ntteution whs
not given merely because we .yore a baseball
party, but because we were American sports
men visiting a country whose peopie have the
greatest admiration and love for ail things
American and athletic. I hope that the base
ball-players, manager*, club officials, presi
dents and baseball public of this country will
extend the band of welcome to the first or
ganized foreign baseball team that will ever
have visited this country, and that an effort
will be made tq make their tour one of pleas
ure as well as profit.
Tnis tour is not contemplated a* a money
making scheme, the phiyers simply being
anxious to visit this country, to meet our peo
ple, our ball-players and to improve them
selves in the game of baseball, with the object
of making international matches between the
two countries in the future a possibility.
I would respectfully ask thai oil clubi, either
professional or amateurs, who desire to play
games with the Australian party wourd cor
respond with Manager Musgrove at the Bald
win Hotel, San Francisco, or with James A.
Hart, president of the Chicago BaseoaU Club,
Chicago, who has kindly volunteered to ba of
such assistance to Mr. Musgrove as he can in
arranging games. I would also urgo that in
naming terms for the games the spirit of liber
ality toward our visitors be shown. It hus not
been positively decided, but it Is possible they
may decide to p ay none but amateurs in the
large cities wnere professional teams are lo
cated, consequently amateur teams when writ
ing should stHte whetner they have or can
secure the proper grounds for games, etc.
Bespeaking a cordial reception of the Aus
tralians by tbo American baseball public and
players, I am youn very truly,
A. G. Spalding.

ital City Wheelmen, who, In point of num
bers, are rapidly becoming the leading club
on the coast, having over 250 names on the
roll, with seven to eight applications atevery
meeting, are desirous of entering a team for
the Varney trophy in the 100-mile relay race
around the bay. They intend to hnve a try
out on Saturday or Sunday la order to de
termine what men will be chosen to enter into
the competition. At present it looks as
though the winners would be Herscli, Young
Ten Bosch, Hubert, Wilson, Payen and Welch.
A. D. Patterson, a promising young wheelman,
who is a member of the club, made a road run
of 11 miles yesterday in 35 minutes flat,
and thinks he can do better in the try-out.
The Capital City Blutrock Club held i'.s an
nual meeting last night and agreed to reuew
membership in the .California inanimate Tar
get Association. It was also decided that eight
club shoots of twenty-five birds each should
constitute the season's meetings, the best five
scores to be taken in computing membership
standing in the various classes. Class A will
consist of tnose members who, at the end of
the season, have made 90 per cent ot" a pos
sible 125; class B, those having scores of
between 75 and 90 per cent; class C, those
having scores below 75 per cent, prizes of
equal value to be awarded to each class, so as.
to promote competition.
The Kimball and Upson shooting grounds will
be put in excellent condition, ana the tirst
shoot will be held next Sunday. The officers
for the ensuing year are: Hal Stevens, presi
dent; E. A. Nicolaus, vice-presidents L. S.
Upson, secretary and treasurer, and F. Ruhs
taller, captain. Nicolaus, Upson and Ruhs
taller were elected as delegates at large to the
State Inanimate Target Association, and it was
decided that the club would be represented
at the next State shoot. Dr. Shaw has de
veloped a laudable ambition to obtain the
scalp of Fish Commissioner Morrison at the
traps this season, and declares that he will
surely accomplish his object. Jim only says,
"We will ste."
The assurance that the new sporting park
will be a thing of the near future has devel
oped quite a boom in baseball circles in this
city, ana there is talk 61 several clubs being
organized immediately. The club known to
fame us the Alkali Kirn:, has oeen reorganized,
and will soon be prepared to make things ex
cee Ungly interesting tor all comprs upon the
diamond. Chick Van Biber, the club's reliable
tirst baseman, who has i.een unable to play
for some time, has again joined the club.
Billy Hamilton, who made a raid on the
geese at the Suisun marshes, has returned
and reports great sport. He claims that his
bag ran ail the way from 1200 to 2000 birds,
but those who claim to be posted say that
three men killed 340 geese in three days'
shoot. Rutherford.

Guiilemet, a fourteen-year-old girl, be re
voked.
The petition avers that Welch has acted
in a most unnatural manner and has
abused his trust as guardian.
The facta of the case as stated in the
petition are as followu: One Francis
Uuilleroet lived over his place of business â ;
a grocerv-storc, with a saloon attached â
at 801 Bush street, with a disreputable
woman. His little daughter, Emily, was
forced to live in the contaminating in
fluence of the woman's company. Guiile
met had prior to the time of Welch's being
appointed guardian been arrested for
letting the child go into barrooms.
Welch's petition for the guardianship of
the child was contested by Guiliernet. It
was shown in court that the fatner was
unlit lor the custody of his daughter and
it was reported that he had been guilty of
a most unnatural crime.
Welch was appointed guardian of the
girl, who was removed to the Florence
Crittenden Home for Unfortunates, where
she afterward became a mother.
Hoi brook asserts in his petition that,
despite the heinous crime commuted and
the evidence that tue father was not a fit
person to take charge of his little daugh
ter, on the lOlh of last February Welch
removed the girl from the in>titutlon, and
the next heard of her she was again in her
father's custody.
The child was left at the home. There
fore Holbruok "prays that this honorable
court appoint some lit and proper person
guardian of such minor, Emily Guille
niet."
SPECIAL ADMINISTRATORS.
Judge Â«'i>n>y Not Willing to Grant Them
Large Compensation.
In the matter of the estate of Lucy C.
Goodspeed nu application was yesterday
made for the payment of partial compen
sation to the special administrators, and
incidentally to allow something on account
for attorneys' fees. The estate is worth
about $350,000.
Judge Coffey said that it was easy
enough to handle the matter of fees for
the lawyers, as that question has been
adjudicated, but he hesitated to make an
oraer touching compensation for special
administrators. If the court should prove
liberal it would not be long before the
business of special administratorship
would grow to be a regular industry, with
vested rights, demanding recognition and
protection. If that should come to pass
and it became known that special admin
trators may secure greater emoluments
than regular administrators then a pre
mium would be offered for delay in clos
ing up the affairs of estates in probate.
Attorneys Heggerty and Hanlon coin
cided in this view and thought that such
compensation ought not to be so large
tuat it would induce delay in probate
proceedings.
Mr. Hanlon added that all he asked for
was fair compensation for the special ad
ministrators and the lawyer?.
J mice Coffey â Fairness of compensation
is a matter of opinion. Some lawyers in
certain litigation think they ought to get
$1000 a montn just because it is a Fair
case.
Mr. Hanlon (smiling)â -This is not a Fair
case.
ThÂ» courtâ True. As Mr. Shortridge,
who represents some of me heirs, has
suggested, this is the Goodspeed case, and
consequently it is reasonable that Good
speed ought to mark the settlement of its
affairs.
Tnen all the lawyers joined in the quiet
lnugh which followed, and the special ad
ministrators were allowed $500 eacli, with
an extra $500 on account for Mr. Hanlon.

Best of Remedies
For the Nervous Exhaustion Conse-
quent Upon Her Arduous Work-
The Remarkable Artiste Who
Stands Preeminently at the
Head of Her Profession.
The news of Modjesba's recovery from
the recent severe sickness that compelled
her to leave the stage will be a source of
congratulation to the whole world.
Modjeska, in a letter to Wells, Richard-
son & Company, says she has found (what
thousands of people in every station of
life have so often heartily testified) that
Paine's celery compound is the very best
of all remedies for nervous exhaustion.
Joseph Haworth rightly calls Modjeska
"the peerless queen of artistes."
Modjcska'a health is a matter of world-
wide interest, and her testimonial to the
value of the great remedy which makes
people well is of particular moment in the
early spring, when from every quarter re-
ports come of men, women and children
who are taking Paino's celery compound
and are gaining in nervous vigor, weight
and every other indication of better
health.

Judge Wallace Remit* the Fine snd

Contractor J. J. O'Brien, who is potting
the new roof on the City Hall, is out of
the legal woods, as far as the sentence of

Wallace is concerned.
The City Hall Commissioners consid

called on Judge Wallace, who consented
to remit the $500 fine and allow O'Brien to
remain without the con lines of Sheriff
Whelan's bnsiile. It was arranged that
the work over his courtroom should cease

Paine's celery compound is prepared in
exact accordance with the prescription of
ProS. Edward E. Phelps, M.D., LL.D., of

reliable remedy for building up a person' 3
health in the spring.
The most overwhelming testimony to
the value of Paine's celery compound that

And then also from the peonle in the
ord:narv walks of life there come thou-
sbnrts of honest, straightforward heart-

pound has made them well.
Th6ir t a timony simply goes to show
what NewEnglund's most vigorous editor
so aptly said in a letter telling of the ben-
efit Paine's celery compound hid been to
a member of his family: "Paine's celery
compound id not a patent medicine; it is
not a sarsaparilla; it is not a mere tonic;
it is not an ordinary nervine â it is as far
beyond them all as the diamond is supe-
rior to cheap glass."
It make- people well. It is the one true
specific recognize:! and prescribed to-day
by eminent practitioners (or diseases aris-
ing from a debilitated nervous system.
Professor Phelps gave to his profession s
positive cure loz sleeplessness, -vasting
strength, dyspepsia, biliousness, liver
complaint, neuralgia, rheumatism, all
j nervous diseases and kianey troubles.
I For all such complaints Paine's celery
I compound has succeeded again and again,
I where everything else has failed.
When Modjeska in a letter published in
1 Boston said: "I have found Paine's celery
I compound the very best of all remedies
for the nervous exhaustion consequent
upon the arduous work of my profession,"
she voiced tne experience of every tired-
out, run-down, exhausted woman who
ever went to this greatest of all spring
i remedies for relief.
No one ever yet failed to find strength
ami health returning who faithfully used
nature's true remedyâ Paine's celery com-
pound.

WATER RATES
Witnesses Who Were Un
certain as to
Facts.
i
Engineer. Schussier Explained
About the City's Con
sumption.
A Talk on/ Meters and Oth?r Matters
Before the Water Committee
of the Supervisors.
The Board of Supervisors went into
committee of the whole on the water
rates last night at half-past 8 o'clock, and
adjourned shortly before 11, after having
accomplished very little beyond the ex
amination of two witnesses and having
some fun with John Fitzgerald, who has
been fighting for many long years to have
the rates reduced to his figures.
Supervisor Clinton presented a petition
for lower rates, and made a speech in
favor of a certain newspaper, which, if the
speech could have been heard or raad by
the civilisred world, would have been
worth $1 a line.
*l The first witness was George yon Staden
Â»f 501 Davis street. He complained that
y lie was charged $2 50 per mouth for a
watering .trough in front of his property,
corner of Bush and Scott streets. The
water which filled h:s trongh came
through a meter. He was charged for the
meter measurement aads2 50extra for the
frame water alter it got into the trough.
Mr. yon Staden added tbat every horse
that drank out of tne trough was charged
for in the stable where it lodged, so that
the witness believed that the company
collected three times for the water in the
trough. His total water rate was $5 70 per
month for a house of two fiats and a gro
cery-store.
Peter Quinlan of the water company
took the bill from the witness and said
that the complainant was not being
charged by meter but by a bxed rate per
month. Meters had not been read in four
years since the passaee of the ordinance
by the Supervisors prohibiting the meter
Ciiarges in private houses. Meters were
read only in factories and other business
places.
In response to a question by Supervisor
Britt Mr. yon Staden said that his bill was
the same for every month and thai a man
came and *' look" "his meter every month
also. The witness wag rather misty con
cerning the meter.
Charles E. Cariilon complained of the
rates for water f)r mixing lime and
cement. He said that the charge should
be one and three-quarter cents for each
barrel of lime and 5 ceu.s lor each barrel
of cement. 1
Mr. Quinlan said that the rates were
based on those of Eastern cities. They
ran from 7 to 10. cents in the East, but
hundreds of dollars' worth of water were
used in each building in the East, whereas
but a very small quantity of water was
used -in the ordinary buildings of this
City, hence the rate was higher.
Mr. Carillon stated that i;e had not paid
anyrbing'.for water in tne last eight years,
and Mr. Quinlan replied t at that was
because ibe company had not caught Mr.
Carillon using its water for mixine Jime
and cement for building houses. He was
not charged for water used in building
sidewalks.
Supervisor Delaney moved that Mr.
Carillon hando ver to the board the money
he had saved during the past eight years
by not paying for his water, the money to
be placed in the fund for tbe unemployed. ;
R. H. Stettin had raid nothing for three ,
years to the water company, but for the '
last mont i or BO Mr. Perley, an employe
ol the Spring Valley Company, had col- '
lected 10 cents a barrel for each carrel of j
cement and 20 cents for each thousand of j
brick wet down.
Mayor Phelan called attention to the i
fact that the schedule price for water for
wetting down brick was only 10 cents.
The witness insisted that he had been
charged 20 cents by Mr. Perley. He was
positive of that fact.
Mr. Quinlan explained that Mr. Perley
was employed by tbe company at a salary
nnd that he was not allowed to collect in
excess of schedule rates and tnat he had
not done so.
On motion of Mr. Smith the company
was ordered to produce the contract made
between Mr. Stettin and the water com
pany.
Dr. Rottanzi cited the case of a woman
named Welsh who resided at 9 South
Park and who wa9 being charged water
rates. In 1892 her bills were $2 20 per
month; in 1893,5350;!n 1894,5340; in
September, 1893, $2 50 was charged lor 130
cubic feet, meter measurement; in Janu
ary. 18y7. the bill was $2 50; in February,
1897. $2 60; and in Maich, 1597, it was
54 25 The lady had a few lodgers.
Mr. Quinlan replied that that was prob
ably one of the ca.Â«es in which the raie
. payer demanded a meter.
"It seems to me," said Supervisor Rot
tanzi, '-that the water company fixes up
iis bills at its pleasure."
Mr. Quinla.n exp ained that only $94 45
was collected from contractors for water
used in building pu r pos>es during the
month of January, 1897. He explained
that the rate charged for private persons
was $2 90 for 1000 feet.
Jonn Fitzgerald was given permission
â .xo make a statement and to ask questions
/afterward. In answer to questions by Dr.
ftottanzi, Mr. Fitzgerald said that the
water supplied by the Spring Valley
Company was of bad quality; that the
rates were based on interest on much
dead property that was not used for tbe
acd'.iisihon,of or the storage cf water, and
that ;he value of the works is much below
the estimate made by the company.'
"Are you the composer of that song en
titled, "Minnehaha. or Laughing Waters" ?
askpd Mayor Phelan.
"Yes," replied the witness; "I make my
living by writing poetry."
"By what meter do you write?" asked
the Mayor amid a burst of laughter.
"Not as high a* tne Sprinir Valley me
ters," responded Mr. Fitzgerald.
Mr. Quinlan explained that the mini
mum rate by meter was $2 50. He refused
to answer any questions pat by Fitzgerald.
"You all know," added Mr. Quinlan,
"why this man is opposing the Spring
Valley Water Company, an.l I don't pro
pose tp talce any notice of him. I will an
swer any questions that may be asked by
the chair or by a rate-payer or by a mem
ber of-the board."
Mr. Fitzgerald -was directed to prepare a
written list of questions and submit them
tip the chair.
Engineer Scbnssler was asked by Dr.
Rottajizi as- to the extent of the water
tbeds of lhe company. He replied that
those of Pilarcitos and San Andreas put
together were 11% quare miles; that of
Crystal Sprints 24 miles. ThÂ» tot'U area
of the direct watersheds was 38 or 39 miles.
Engineer fcchussier of ihe Spring Valley
Water Company corrected a mistake that
had been made by some newspapers in
â¢ commenting upon certain testimony given
in 1887 by himself and Mr. Lawrence, de
ceased/ Mr. Lawrence had testified that the
total consumption of ihe City and County
of San Franc^c was 24.000,000 eallons per
day on some days, Mr. Schussler bad
testified in the same case that it was
20,000,000 gallon? per day.
"At that time," continued Mr. ScJuiss
ler, "we were prepared to furnish 16.000,
--000 gallons per day on some days, and on j
others 24,000,000 gallons were furnished.
The wamc- was fully 3,000,000 per day.
Add Â«he waste, and then the lowest rate
per 1000 gallons couid be found. In 1887
and 1888 we put on 6609 meters for tbe
purpose of reducing the waste and we
succeeded in two years in reducing ti.e
consumption, which averaged in 1887 over
19,000,000 gallons, to 17,000,000."
The committee of the whole reported
progress Â»nd Thursday evening of next
week was fixed as the date lor the next
sitting on the water question.
The board adjourned until Monday
evening.

MORE ROCKS THAN GOLD
Francisco Rodrigues Invests in
a Bad Mining
C aim.
A Sacramento For;uae- Teller Informed
H j m He Wonli Soon Be Possessed
cf Tremendous Wealth.
A subpena issued from Police Judge
Low's court for the attendance of Nevada
County's Recorder in the case of Professor
John Tilton, who is charged with obtain
ing money by false pretenses, brings to
lipht tbe story of a mining swindle perpe
trated on an unsuspecting Portuguese
with more than a salutary regard for the
prophecies of fortune-tellers.
Francisco Rodriguez, the, victim, in
vested a couple of dollars with a medium
in Sacramento last January. Among the
bright things told him was that he would
soon meet with a wealthy mine-owner,
who would give him the opportunity of
his life to realize a vast fortune in a short
time on a comparatively small financial
outlay.
A lew days later, January 15, Rodriguez
was on the train from Sacramento to this
City, when he was engaged in conversa
tion by Tilton, who showed him pome
rich quartz he had extracted from a mine
he owned In the North Uioomneld dis
trict, near Nevada City.
Rodriguez immediately remembered the
fortune-teller's words, and before the
train reached this City he had arranged
with the stranger lor a smitH share in the
mine. He paid Tilton $300 in cash and
agreed to work the cmini at $3 per day
until he had earned $200 which was to go
toward a full payment of $600 for a half'
interest.
Tilton and Rodriguez went to the min
ing district aud the former showed his
newly made friend a mountain of rocks
by the roadside.
"Thai's tho mine,' he said. "Now, you
go to worK there and get out all you can
before I get back."
RoJrguez labored hard and diligently,
but nevei saw the color of pay quartz. As
Tilton failed to show up, and <â¢Â» Rodriguez
began to realize he bad been swindled, he
returned to this City and cauSea Tilton's
arrest.
The papers consummating ihe deal were
made out by Auorney E. M. Morgan, who
recently disappeared*, leaving a score of
mourning creditors behind.
BUTLEK CLOSELY GUARDED.
Every ) (l'ort Will Be Made to Prevent
His Suicide.
Butler, the Australian murderer, will be
deported on the Mariposa, which sails on
Thursday. One of the cabins will be
made in'.o a barred prison, with iron doors
and barred portholes.
At the request of United State* Marshal
Baldwin yisierday a double watch was
put on Butler at the jail. This was in re
sponse to a reauest from tbe British Con
sul, whose anxiety for the safety of the
prisoner increases as the time for deport
ing him draws near.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 27, 1897.
WELLS IS THE
" INDOOR KING"
He Earns the Title by De
feating a Dczsn Crack
Riders.
George Tantau, Tandem Paced,
Brought the Mile Amateur
Record to 2:00 1-5
Foster to the Front for the First Time
During the Tournamentâ Lacey's
Great Five-Mile Ride.
By defeating a field of a dozen of the
fastest professional riders in the country
Charles S. Wells of the Bay City Wheel
men again demonstrated bis remarkable
speed at the cycle tournament last night,
and can justly be dubbed the "indoor
kine." It was a clean-cut victory, and a
popular one, too.
Sharing the honors with Wells is big
"Bob" lerrill, woo ran second to him and
pressed him hard for the honor of firat
position.
George W. Tantau of the Olympic Club
! Wheelmen rode a splendid exhibition
j mile, paced by two tandem teams, cover
ing the distance in 2:00 1-5. This is the
fastest mile ridden at the tournament.
There was a curious mix-up in the sec
ond heat of the mile professional consola
tion, a race for non-winners at the tour
nament. Harry Terrill, Morris, Chap
man and Byrne were the riders. They
were just rounding the last turn when
Terrili's tire exploded and he was thrown,
bringing down the entire bunch with him.
They all jumped to their feet, and drag
ging their demolished wheels after them
started to run for the tape. Terrill
reached it first, Chapman close after him.
One of the most interesting rides of the
evening was a five-mile exhibition against
time by F. G. Lacey of Los Aneeles. He
was paced the first half of the distance by
Griffiths and Davidson and the second
I half by Kraft and Tom Hall, two crack
Buy City tandem teams.
Griffiths and Davidson carried him the
j first half in 1:03 1-5, and the first mile in
2:05 2-5. Two miles were ridden in
14:14 35. Hall and Kraft made a beauti
! tut pickup when the change was made.
! The third mile was ridden in 2:03 1-5,
i making three miles n 6:17 3-5. Four miles
I were ridiien in 8:28 4-5. Then Griffiths
i and Davidson swuag in to pace Lacey
! again, and drew him' out at his tot. speed
to the finish. The time for the five miles
was 10:50 3-5, world's indoor record.
Tue race of the evening was the mile in
vitation, professional, oniy the cracks of
the meet being invited to compete. In
the first heat were Downing and Davis of
San Jose, Stevens of lowa and Wells of

place and got it. and stayed there to the
tape. Stevens ran into second place, and
Downing got thint.
There were three cracks in the second
heat â Becker of Minneapolis, Starbuck of
Philadelphia and Eaton of Chicago.
Eaton for the first time since the begin
ning of the tournament ran true to ins
Eastern form, winning after & long sprint
with Becker.
Three popular Californians contested in
the third heat, McFarland, Jones and
"Bob" Terrill. Tney exchanged the
'pacing nicely and ware on equal terms
when the sprint be. an, with Jones in tbe
lead. McFarland jumped him, however,
and Terrill, following closely behind, fel 1
into second place.
This gave Eaton, Bob Terrill, Wells and
McFarland a place in the final, which was
paced by Morris. At the pistol-shot all four
jumped to catch tne pacer, Eaton being
the first to reach him, McFarland second,
then Wells and Terrill. It was a speedy
ride, and Eaton still h&d tbe lead when
the pacer swung out at lhe end of tbe
fifth lap. Wells started his sprint oa the
sixth lap, wrh a quarter of a miie yet to
go, and Terrill tacked on behind him and
was pulled vast the other two. When
Wells once got the lead it Wps all ovor
but the shouting, he winning in clever
style, Terrill running second, McP'arland
' third. Toe time was 2:08 1-5.
After the ore iminaries bud been run
the lie d in the mile consolation race was
narrowed down to Walter Foster, Harry
Terrill, Arthur Boyden and Tom Sullivan,

was put in to pace, aud made it hot for
six laps, when he dropped out and left the
mentotigh. it out among themselves.
They rode the first half in 1:08. Terrill
started an early sprint for home, but
could not hold it. Foster came on sTomr

NOTJBS OF THii MEET.
Charley Well?, big, good-natured, and
speedy, is the most popular rider with the
audience. "Bob" Terrill and Allan Jones
also come in for a large share of the pub
lic's approbation, r
Enter Wells, the "indoor king," exit
Eaton. . â â .-,'
Neither Eaton nor Starbuck are riding
up to their true form. . : r
Manager Sbafer looked happy. Probably
the large crowd present was one of the
reasons.
The management has a great card on
for next Wednesday night. It is a match
race between Loughead, Eaton,; Becker
and Wells, at one mile, for a purse of $400,
best two in three heats.
The management should arrange a three
corner in a ten between the crack amateurs,
Kennc, Russ and Lacey. ' V w>">K
- Jay," Eaton, the "indoor king," is the
most, contented loser at the meet. He is
never heard to utter a kick.
Becker and Eaton brought the tasaeled
skull-cap idea out here. Now half the
racing contingent is wearing them. >
; Corbett tried the track on a tandem
yesterday afternoon, with George Dixon
on the front seat. Tbe first time around
the steep banks Jim's pompadour stood
up : straitjhter than ever before. : But he
soon became accustomed to the hair
raising experience. v -

delay before he 'could get another whee â¢

Schefski 'of Salt Lake is the wonder of

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top flgujÂ«a
at station indicate maximum temperatur* for the
days: those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during tbe past twelve hours. Isobars, or tollu]
lines, connect po!n s of equal air pressure: iso
therms, or dotted tinea, equal temperature. The
word "blzh" means hitch barometric pressure and
is usually accomt>an!ed by fair weather: "low
refers to' low pressure, and is . usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rain*.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington .
coast. When he pressure is high In the interior
and low along the coast, and the iiobars extend
north and south alone thÂ» coast, rain Is probable: ,
but when the "low- "is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb- |
able. With a "high" In the vicinity of Idaho, and
tbe pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weÂ»ther may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

CHICAGO. 11.i.. March 26 âDullness was allied
with weakness in the wheat market this morning.
Liverpool cables came with s/ d decline, which
was a greater loss than too* place here yesterday.
Northwestern receipts were heavy at 383 cars, as
compared with 297 las. Friday and 392 a year ago.
Fine spring weather was a potent argument In
the bands of the bears. In the opening there was
more or less profit securing by "shorts," which
helped to lift pricÂ« s from tbe inside. A decline of
6-16 in consul* was looked upon by some as an
important item in favor of higher prices, but the
fact that Liverpool declined in price for wheat
counteracted the influence.
Chicago received 19 cars and inspected out 77.
--770 bush-Is. About noon St. Louis advanced over
a cent on a bullish report for the week by Modern
Miller, our market following to some extent. Ex
port clearances were liberal at 439,974 bushels.
Closing Pans cables were lower for flour, and
higher for wheat. Benin and Antwerp were lower.

. CUiv.V- The tone of the corn market mas rather
weak, although there was some display of courage
by holders. The receiptsâ l2s carsâ were fifty
more than expected. : That, with the sympathy
existing between this grain and wheat, was the
means of - bringing aoout a moderate. decline
withdrawals from store were fair at 113,490
bushels Liverpool caoles quoted aqulei and un
changed market at that place. lixports were lib
eral at 854.992 bushels. The later strength of
wheat helped 1 orn. May corn opened at 24V2C,

shade under yesterday. Estimated receipts fur
to-morrow, 120 cars. â¢
OATSâ I here was neither strength nor activity
in oats early. The main feature in defining the
tone was the action of tbe ieadiuic markets. The
tin- mess consisted mainly of local transactions
with professionals generally working in the direc
tion of forcing a decline. London Alark-Lane
cabie quoted 3d dec me on oats a: that plice.
There were no withdrawals from store. Prices
firmed with those of wlieat laier iv the session.

NEW YORK, X V., March 26.â R. o. Dun A
(o. will say to-morrow in their weekly review of
THE 8&N FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 27, 1897.
trade: Never have markets sustained such a sur
prising strength as they have received of late and
with 'so little | business. - Foreign conditions ami
London alarms, the collapse of the iron-ore "combi
nation, the destructive â¢ Hoods in the Mississippi
Valley ( and the ; decision |of the Supreme Court
against railroad associations have been used to the
utmost, but not even iv railroad stocks has the
result been important. With. courage that: belter
times are coming men are less disposed every day
to throw away good in vestments, and the very
fact that prices of products are low is regarded j as
a guarantee against much further decline. ' Id all
industries also the number of mills and shops
and hands at work gradually increases. ', >â 
The iah road i have been subjected to so much
loss of late b. cutting of rates inspke of all asso
ciation!! that the possibility of open and un
restricted competition ins.cad of agreeratrr.s
which restrict only the rut. re lionest may we 1
have a s^berni}; influenc â¢. - The earnings for
March thus far, .on y 4 per cent below -last
year's, compare not unfavorably with the full re
turns for February, 7 per cent below last year's. ;
The grain markets haw lost without reason the
gain (hey ma ie without reason the previous week.
Whew Supplies are running out, but nobody be
lieves that there is com Ins a famine before J tine
when the harves ing of southern wheat will begio.

prospect for the crop of winter wheat haa more
weight. â¢ . - :
Atlantic exports, flour Included, were nearly as
large for the week as last year, and for four wee<s
have been 6,050,728 bushels, against 6,606,220
last year. But corn exports have been 12,763,579
bushels, " again m 4,577,609 last year. hen
Europe buys in corn the -equivalent of 6,400,000
bushels ot wheat at less than 60c the price of
wheat is not easily advanced above 80c. i Cotton
was helped upward an eighth by the flood, but has
lost hall the gain, although manufacturing is not
hopeful. Without change in prices goods were in
better demand and sales of 5000 pieces of print
cloths result in a, stronger tone. â ;â 'â¢â  â 
â  The final dissolution of the Lake iron ore pool
has been expected ever since the Carnegie-Rocke
feilerdeal and lmure.i low prices for ore during
the coming year, though perhaps not lower than
in 895. Mesaba facilities for . production \ have
vastly increased, and all the gr. at steel-making
concerns have been securing mines of their own,
while means of transport* ion have greatly been
enlarged. Witn assurances of cheap ore hesitation
about various products should diminish and the
demand is steadily increasing Bars are still de
moralized and at the lowest point, but for plates,
sheets, wire rods and wire and all nails the de
mand is growing larger.
The demand for rails continues enough to
strengthen prices, ' although some from specula
tive purchasers are offered below the present prices
of mills". Tin is a shade lower with larger receipts,'
though ihediuribution has been considerable, and
lead is decidedly stronger at 47, but copper ?Is
weak at 11.76. Increase in cose product. on ap
pears, and more is assured by the purchase of
works by the Canibr.a company, and while quota
tions are unchanged outsiders are offering furnace
at $1 70 per ton.

for four weeks than ever before, 46,605,300
pounds, anaiiisv 21,984.576 in the same weeKs of

noted, although there is tendency to lower limits
for the future load rig of foreign coals,' as ton nag"
to transport our wheat will consist; principally of
Coal when coming here. For the moment the
Coast collieries are almost entirely furnishing this
market with fuel, as so far this month there have
only been four arrivals of Australian and English,
yet there has been no change in values. The tint
train of Corral Hollow Coal reached Stockton this
week, and next month we may. expect shipments
here. Consumers are anxiously awaiting its com

give the resul'.s which have been promised by the

THE SUPERVISORS
Shall There Be More Than
One Bridge Across the
Estuary ?
,Â£uperinteiMent Curtis Says That
a'Doub'e-Dzcked Draw Is
Feasible.
" ' âââ
' Oa No Account, However, Would the
Southern P. cific Takj the Upp?r
Portion.
Oakland Office Sax Feaxcisco Call.)
90S Broadway, March 26. J
It now seems very probable that there
will be two bridges across the estuary in
btead of the one large structure that was
proposed by those interested in the ma
rine traffic of the estuary. The influence
of those interested in the railroad travel
across the water will' probably prevail.
For several months the Supervisors and
the railroad company have been trying to
- arrive at an understanding, but nothing
definite has been done. The Supervisors
are ready to agree to a double-deck bridge
if the railroad company will go overhead.
This they declare is absolutely impossible
account of, the two approaches that
fan account to be built to make the system
would have to be built to make the system
r practicable.
TV. G. Curtis, the superintendent of con
struction of the Southern Pacific, said to
day that the railroad -cannot under any
circumstances accept the overhead ar
rangement.
"Under no condition " said Mr. Curtis,
"can we accept the proposition to go over
head in the event of but one bridge being
built. *
"Suppose Oakland owned the railroad â
- â where would it be placed? There would
be no question then of taking the upper
berth. Why should we be expected to go
above when our trains are heavier and
much less easy to handle than the other
cars or teams which will use .the bridee?
. "Yes. a single bridge lor both cars and
pedestrians is feasible enough, but there
would be much danger of accidents at
tached where the tracks have to cross the
roadway. With the overhead plan acci
dents in this respect are entirely avoided,
and this is an important matter for con
sideration.
"Ttie War Department has only sug
gested that one bridge take the place of
the two. There has been no order to this
effect, nor do I think any.is contemplated.
The department has demanded both the
railroad and the county to rep&ir the
bridges, though.
â¢ "There is no getting out of the question I
that the single bridge for both would cost !
each of us fully as much as separate
bridges wilL It is only for the interest of
Oakland's commerce on the water %ront i
that the matter is being considered at all. !
We want the people to understand that J
we are trying to reach an amicable con
clusion whereoy the county and the rail
road can co-operate.
â¢'lt is unreasonable to suppose that the I
company will pay more than its share of ;
the cost, as some of tha Supervisors have |
suggested, nor is it right to expect us to
participate in meeting the expense of the j
lone ojiproajche* which area necessity with j
tee double-deck bridge. -
"The Southern Pacific Company is ready j
and waiting for the Supervisors to make a â¢
.proposition, now that the Legislature has i
removed the obstacles in the way. We i
want this matter settled definitely so that ;
we. may know whether to put up our own I
bridge or join with the county.
. "If the Supervisors intend to stand by i
come of tbe ideas I have heard the com- j
pany will of necessity have to act alone." j
QUEEN OF ARBOR DAY.
Pretty CÂ«remnn<Â«i Carried Oat at Fruit
vale's New Public School.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 26.â Arbor day
was celebrated by the Fruitvale school
this afternoon. Parents and pupils and
teachers joined bands to have a pretty
celebration, and they were successful.
Fruitvale school, which was built a year
ago, is one of the best equipped in the
county. It is situated on a commanding
eminence, containing a beautiful view of
the surrounding country, and is in an
ideal location.
Stella Shoemaker wss chosen queen,
Alice Bechtel was her maid of honor and
tne attaches of the court were Cecil Har
rold. Fannie Piaw, Eihel Thornton, Grace
Ralston, Leo Gulick, Marguerite Mitchell,
Elsie Newman ajid Helen Becbtel. The
queea was attired in white. She is a very
attraciive young lady of about niteen
summers.
The queen carried a royal bouquet and
her white garb was very becoming, backed
by the pale-blue dresses of her attendants,
all of whom carried delicate bouquets.
As the regal procession reached the mid
dle of the stage, wh cli in itself looked
like a natural piece of forest, each young
lady presented a little branon of a tree to
the queen, who accepted it with an ap
propriate remark. As they marched back
the queen returned their branches, which
she bad laid at her feet while the proces
sion was passing.
The programme was a pleasing study.
It consisted of characteristic recitations,
dialogues and dances, in which different
young ladies represented flowers. The
tableaux were perfect. The boys were as
active as the girls, and one part of the pro
gramme was as well maintained as an
other.
County Superintendent of Schools Gar
lick made an appropriate speech, and at
the conclusion of the exercises each class
received its friend* Id its classroom.
The trees, tiie planting of which was
celebrated to-day, were placed around the
schoolhoute two weeks ago.
FLETZ'S BAD LUCK.
Punued by a Wife Whom He Thought
Â«Â»Â« Divorced.
OAKLAND, Cal.. March 2ftâ Fred W.
Pietz of Liver.iune, against whom trie
Grand Jury returned an indictment for
bigamy, seems to be in bad luck. There
is no doubt that he literally committed
bigamy, because he was married to bis
second wife before the recording of tne de
cree from his first wife. Pietz says, and it j
is not doubted, that be put up the money j
for the lees, and concluded that the de
cree was granted, and not until be had
been married to a young lady at Liver
more did i.is first wife discover tbat the
decree was not on record.
She then had nim arrested, but his
young wife procured bonds and got him
out of jail on Christmas day.
When the case came to trial the first
wife, being sti.l his legal wife, could not
testify against him; the second wife abso
lutely refused to do so, and there being
no evidence Pietz was dismissed. Since
then the first wife hah in voted tbe aid of
Uie Grand Jury, an 1 it being very clear
that a technical offense nad been com
mitted, there was no alternative but to
return an indictment. Whpn the case

comes to trial the same circumstances as
to evidence will prevail, and it is not easy
to see how a conviction can ensue.
MANUEL TGO HASTY.
Evidence 1 hÂ»> the Water Ordinance
\V:is M slaid by Mistake.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 26.â The omis
sion for one day of the publication of the
water-rate ordinance will have no effect
on that measure. Publisher Dargie said
to-day that it was accidentally left out of
the form by the foreman and that the
clerk who made out the affidavit of pub
lication did not know of any omission.
At the meeting ol the Council last night
Councilman Manuel staled that ho be
iieved that Air. Dingee or his manager
were responsible for the omission, Tiiis
evening Mr. Dingee authorized tho follow
ing statement:
I know nothing about the delinquent pul>U
cailon, anil I am quite sure tnat Mr. Muffin
kaows nothing ebiut it. Councilman MÂ«D
ucl's statement tnat he is sa:islied tnat Mr.
Moffitt is at the bottom of it i= an indirect cut
at me, which I reseut lor ttie reason that Mr.
Moffitt cannot possibly have any interest of
any character In the water ordinance of Oak
land, aua so far as the propo-ed water raies
are concerned, I want to say to the people of
Oakland and to Councilman Manuel in par
ticular, that I will never at any time be found
taking advantage of any mistake, or interfer
ing in any xaam.er with the rates proposed.
If an error in pr nting has been made it can
essl.y b.' corrected, and the new Council, v.ith
out any protest on my part, or on the part of
any of my friends, can establish them on the
lines originally laid out.
"I notified the City Clem," said Mr.
Dargie, "as soon as the blunder had been
discovered, and that ought to be proof
there was no job in it, because now tbe
error can be corrected. Ii I had intended
to ptevent the fixing of the water-rate or
dinanc â¢ I would have lei the Council go
on and pass an inva id ordinance!"
Mr. Dargie now proposes to print tiie
ordinance to-night, Saturday night anrl
Monday night, completing the required
ten publications, and he thinks the old
Council can finally pass the ordinance
Monday evening before yielding up office
to its successor.
HOME-FINDING SOCIETIES
Their Responsibility Will Soon
Bb Tested in the
Courts.
One of Their Wards Drifted About
Until He F.nally Landed
in Jiil.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March '.6. \
An important point has arisen regard
ing the jurisdiction of home-finding so
cieties in the case 01 Elmer Elliott, a Jad
nine years of aeo, whose custody i-Â« now
warned by his mother and a society which
undertook some time ago to put the child
in a home where he would have a pood
education. The fact that a bonu3 is paid
by the society for each child for whom a
home is found also figures in the problem.
Little Elmer is a bright lad, who is now
at the West Oakland Home. Mrs. Pres
cott, secretary of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children, is at pres
ent legally resuonsible to the court for his
custody and she has just received two de
mands for the child. One is lrom Ji is
mother and the other is from the society
that once found it a home.
The "home" found for the lad was at
Lorin with a Mrs. Brown, and nis mother
was informed that the toy wouiti be well
looked after and would be Â«iven a fir<t
class education. Instead of these benefits |
young Elliott, after ihe novelty of having j
him in her home wore off, found himself
accused by Mrs. Brown of stealing half a
dollar. For tnis crime Mrs. Brown had :
the boy placed in jail, and it was made to j
appear that he was the most incorrigible
lad of his age in the world.
The Judge sent him to the West Oak
land Home, where he is at present.
When the mother was informed of what
had occurred she wrote to Mrs. Prescott.
"These home-finding societies are an
excellent thinjr," said the secretary to
day, "but they are not conducted on a
sufficiently practical basis.
"When we lake charge of a child for any
cause whatever, if it has no guardian le
gally fitted to look after it we take out
letters of guardianship, and this noi only
gives us a right to mane proper provision
for a child, but it makes us legally respon
sible for the child's welfare.
"If it be a waif and any one wishes to
adopt it we can act for the child, and its
paient3 by adoption are then legally re
sponsible for it, and all along it is pro
tected by law.
"In the case that has now come to our

ily of J. A. Edgren are trying to discover

loud crash in tha dining-room. They
went downstairs, found the heavy table

smashed. Mr. Edjjren has no other ex
planation to make than that a burglar
got into the huuse and becoming fright

Another Excuse for Corbett.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 26.â 8i11y De
laney has discovered another cause why
Corbett was defeated. Ha now states that
the ring at Carson was too small, and that
it was only a little more than 19 ieet
square instead of 24.
"This naturally is a big disadvantage
for Corbett. He needed all tne room
allowed, and I do not know who author
ized reducing the space. With reference
to a stipulation to tight at leaat ten rounds
on account of the kinetoscope, I don't
Know anything about it. If it was made
I was on tlie outside and not consulted."

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, 31 ARCH 27, 1807.
DAVIE AND GARRITY

All Manner of Fraud Al

Election.
It Is Said Officials Served Who

The Mayor Dsclares He I? Not Mak"

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Murch 26. )
Mayor-elect Thomas and City Attorney
elect Dow will have to stand a contest for
ttieir respective seats. This afternoon theÂ»
Jong-promised papsrs were filed by Attor
ney George de Golia, and a recount is
THE LATEST IN MUNICIPAL POLITICS.
Mayor Davie's friends believe he was counted out ami have undertaken a contest to unseat Mayor-elect Thomas. Colonel
Garrity's Iriends claim to have evidence of fraud and will try to oust City Attornej-elect Dow.
asked. The official figures for these can
didates are: Thomis, 3071; D.tvie, 2962;
Dow. 4451; Garrity, 4225.
These figures show a plurality for
Thomas of 109 and for Dow of 226. Messrs.
Davie and Garrity believe that a recount
will show that they should hold respec
tively the offices of Mayor and City At
torney, and in twenty pages of a com
plaint they Btate the reasons for their be
lief.
In noarly every precinct, it is alleged,
the men who were watching on behalf of
Davie and Garrity, saw votes counted for
Thomas ana Dow that were cast for the
contestants.
The various charges made, if true,
would show the majorities are just about
right, but that they should be given to the
contestants instead of the contestees.
It is alleged that in the Second Precinct
of the Second Ward the Doard gave eight
een votes to T omas that belonged to
Davie and ten to Peirsol that should have
been credited to Garrity. In the Third
Precinct of the Second Ward Davie, it is
alleged, was defrauded of nine votes and
Garrity of three. The losaes that it is
alleged Davie and Garrity sustained in
various other precincts are as follows:
Fourth Precinct, Seveiun Ward, Davie
7, Garrity 5; F.rst Precinct, Tnird WÂ«rd,
Davie 11. Garrity 13; Second Precinct,
Third Ward, DaviÂ« 5; Third Precinct,
Third Ward. Garrity 14, Davie 7; First
Precinct, Fourth Ward, Da/ne 9, Garrity
15; Second Precinct, Fourth Ward, Davie
4, Garritv 13; Third Precinct, Fourth
Ward, Davie 12, Garritv 9; First Precinct,
Fifth Ward, Davie 6; Second Precinct,
Fifth Ward, Davie 5, (iarrity 1; Third
Precinct, Fifth Ward, Davie 3 Garrity 5;
First, Second, Third and Fourth Pre
cincts, Seventh Ward, Davie 37, Garrity 29.
The contestants assert that great irregu
larities existed in regard to voters being
assisted to mark their ballot-, in many
instances it is alleged that the legal snow
ing o! physical disability was not made
and (hat ballots were marked fraudulently
and in opposition to the wishes of such
voters.
A direct charge is made that in the First,
Second and Third precincts of the Third
Ward Joseph King, who was not a mem
ber of any board in the ward, was permit
ted to call off the names from the ballots
and have the same tallied and entered as
add-d up by him. The charge is also
made that none of tne members of the
boards were upon tiie last assessment-roll ;
that t hoy were all of one political in tli.an i
that some of them could not read and
write the English language.
Instead of the poll* iii the Fourth Pre
cinct of the Seventh Ward being open at
5:40 it is alleged that they were not
opened till 7:45, and that consequently
100 commuters who would hsive voted for
DÂ«vie wÂ«re deprived of the franchise.
When spoken to to-night Mayor Davie
said: "This contest was not undertaken
by me, and I do not really know who is
the prime mover. It is the rigbt of every
citizen who can pay for it to make a con
test, and if fraud has been committed I
would naturally like to see it proved."
DISPUTED BALLOTS.
A Claim That the Law Hai Not Been
Complied With in Preparing the
Ballots for the Election.
ALAMEDA. Cal., March 26.â Another
ripple has been caused in political circles
with regard to the preparation of the bal
lots for the coming election. It comes
from the same source as the one noted
yesterday â R. B. Tappan, candidate for
City Attorney. The law requires that the
name of each candidate shall be accom
panied by the name of the party whose
nominee he is. On tbe tickets that
have been printed and approved by the
City Attorney and County Clerk tiie nomi
nees aru represented its being the candi
dates of the Non-Parthan party or the
Good Government Club, and as independ
ent, or in some cases, all three combined.
To the designation of "Good Govern
ment Ciub" Mr. Tappan takes exception
and has filed formal notice of protest with
tbe City Clerk, concluding with a demand
that tie word* complained of be omitted
from the official ballots. Further com
plaint is made that the sample ballots
that have been prepared for sending out
do not bear that de it; nation upon their
face and that they are consequently
illegal. The City Clerk has declined to
take cognizance of Mr. Tappan's protest,
and it is reported iliat that gentleman
will apply for a writ of mandate to have
the official ballots prepared as he believes
the law requires.
Sleserole-Jaraen.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 26.â The quiet
and unheralded wedding of Miss M -ttie
Meserule, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. G. F.
Meserole of this city, to William James of
ban Francisco at San Rafael last Tuesday
was a source of great surprise both to the
paren ts and to ttie wide circle of friends of
the young lady. While Mr. James had
bceti assiduous in his attentions, marriage
had not been hinted at, and the parents
hud no inkling of what had taken place
until the day after the wedding, when the
yojng couple appeared and introduced
themselves as husband an t wife. On the
day of the wedding it is t>aid Miss Meser
ole lett home ostensibly to visit a friend,
and her absence wnen night came caused
no alarm, as it was supposed she had de
cided to prolong her visit till next day.
There does not appear to have been any
particular necessity for so much secrecy,
as tne parental blessings have been freely
bestowed upon the happy young couple
and all is well as well can be.
Work Stopped.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 26.â The work
of grading, curbing and macadamizing
Santa Clara avenue from the east line of
! the Cohen property to High street, pass
ing through the noted Indian shell
mound, has been stopped for an indefinite
period because of a protest filed by the
trustees of the father estate. The
protestants represent all the frontage on
both sides of the avenue, and they claim
that the improvement is not needed, that
it will be a great hardship to have to pay
for the work at the present time, and that
it is not needed anyhow. The work has
consequently been suspended for tix
mouths.
The PoÃtmasteriiilp.
ALAMEDA, Cal, March 28.â There was
considerate talk about town this morn
ing over the dispatch from Washington
stating that Dr. McLean, the City Health
Officer, is to De given the postmastership
of Alameda. It was known that be had
tried to obtain the indorsement of the
California delegation for the position of
Surveyor of the Port of San Francisco,
but it was not known that he bad aspira
tions in the direction of the postoffice.
The statement in this regard is not cred
ited here. Before he went East he signed
the petition of E. A. Randlett for the
postmastersbip, and it in not believed
that he would now try to obtain the honor
for himself.
The Estuary Bridge.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 26.âConsider
able interest is taken in the discussion of
the matter of the proposed new bridge
across the estuary. There is one thing in
this connection in which Alameda is prac
licailv a unit, and that is the desire not to
abandon the present location at Webster
street. There are a variety of reasons for
not desiring any change, principal among
which is the disastrous effect which it
would have on business interests at the
west end. As to the desirability of having
one or two bridges public sentiment hits
not yet crystalliz d sufficiently to giye an
idea of its trend.
Notes.
Rev. Haskett Smith delivered his last lec
ture in this city last evening, talcing as bis
subject "Crete and the Islands of Greece."
There was a large audience present, and as the
topic was a timely one aud well handled it was
received with great Interest.
Mrs. Cohen offered to pay the expense of
caring for the firemen injured on Tuesday at
the burning of Fernside, out the offer w. s de
clined, inasmuch as iheyare beiug attended
gratuitously by Dr. Pond.
Oakland wants Alameda to raise $1000 for
fl eworks display and water carnival on the
Fourth of July, but there Is little prospect that
the expectation will be reaiiz.d.

STILL HARPING ON
THAT MANDOLIN
Witnesses Add Interesting
Phases to the Justice
Carroll Case.
The Famous Instrument Was
Said to Have Burned With
Uncle Tom's Cabin.
The Deacon Embczzl raent Case Also
Brought Before the Jury by
Larzilere.
The Grand Jury yesterday surpassed its
previous record in the number of casei
beard. The case against Justice of tbe
Peace John A. Carroll took precedence in
the number of witnesses and the time
consumed, but no conclusion was reached.
Attorney Frank Shea, who was attorney
for Josie Gibbons in her contest with
Cipollini for possession of the mandolin
on which all the trouble hinges, told a
story of some interest lo the jury. He
said that alter Justice Carroll had had
possession of the mandolin for some time
Miss Gibbons asked him (Shea) to
see Carroll and yet the instrument
for her. He visited Carroll and asked lym
for it. Carroll said it had been destroyed
and he would be unable to return it, but
that if civen time he would pay Miss Gib
bons the value in money. He said that
he bad left the mandolin in a saloon and
that the barkeeper and some young women
had taken it with them on an excursion
to "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and there left it.
When that famous road house was burned
the mandolin, he said, was burned with it.
"I had to accept the story as true, "said
Shea, "and so was somewhat surprised
when I learned that the instrument was
here in tho hands of the Grand Jury,
brought here by Carroll in response to a
subpena by the Grand Jury."
Attorney McCabe, who was counsel for
the music teacher Cipollini, was also a
witness, and told how Carroll came in
possession of the instrument; t.iat it was
given to him by Miss Gibbons to keep for
her after he (Justice Carroll) had dismissed
the case before him for its recovery, and
another suit had been brought before an
other Justice â Justice Cook. Carroll was
to take care of it until the case was deter
mined, and not allow Cipollini or his
agents to get it in any event.
Justice Cook was also a witness, produc
ing his books and showing the record in
the case as it transpired before him; how
Miss Gibbons was not present at the time
the case was called, and judgment was
rendered against her in default.
The matter will be heard iurther next
Friday. Justice Carroll insists that there
is nothing in the case against him and
that tho girl'H friends are seeking to dam
age him for their own interests.
Thomas Murphy was before the jury
seeking to secure an ind.ctment against
Henry Cornfut for the murderous assault
committed upon him on the night of De
cember 21 in an attempt to burglarize bis
place. The indictment will be returned
on Tuesday next.
W. R. Larzalere was also before the jury
to tell the story of the embezzlement from
him of $700 by bis cashier, Deacon.
Dr. Williamson was also called with the
purpose ot going into a lurther hearing of
the City and County Hospital scandal.
Word reached the jury that the doctor's
child was seriously Ul and they dismissed
him.

A New York literary man relates that ho recently had occasion to consult a well-
known physician for a stomach trouble which was pronounced a type of dyspepsia.
" After consultation," hÂ« writes, " the Doctor gave me a prescription, and I was
somewhat surprised to note that the formula was nearly identical with that cf
Ripans Tabules
for which I had, on more than one occasion, prepared advertising matter. I had the
prescription filled, and it proved satisfactory, giving quick relief. A week later,
when 1 had taken all the medicine, 1 again called on the Doctor and mentioned the
similarity of kis prescription and the proprietary remedy spoken of, showing him
both the remedy itself and the formula. The Doctor was at tint somewhat inclined
to criticise what he called patent medicines, but appeared to be surprised when he
noted to what extent his own prescription conformed to the formula I showed him.
It was practically the same. After a short time devoted to noting the careful man-
ner in which the proprietary medicine was prepared, he wound up by prescribing it
for my case. Of course I had to pay him for telling me to do this, but it was worth
the cost to have such high professional assurance that the advertised article was, in
fact, the scientific formula that it purported to be. I might have taken the proprie-
tary medicine in the beginning and sared the Doctor's fee, but I think the confidence
I have acquired in the efficacy of the remedy, through the Doctor's indorsement of
it, is well worth the fee."
; FOOP COFFEE. â¢- '
.' ; Simple Breakfasts.'
. The Scotch make oat porridge the prin-
cipal part of their breakfast, and this
habit of the sturdy race :is com in Â« into
quite general \ fayor in \ America. Some
fruit and grain with a hot cup of Postum
Cereal and bread and butter is an ideal
health breakfast. .. ..
â ;â .: Coffee hurts many people in ways they
do not suspect. â¢ v
Any disorder of the stomach, bowels,
kidneys, palpitation of â  the ' heart,' weak
eyes, etc., originates in a weakened ner-
vo is system, caused by some foreign ele- H
ment the nerves cannot stand.
, Coffee and tobacco are powerful drugs
and directly affect : the nervous system.
Quit the cause of the disorder and nature
will generally heal up the affected parts.
Postnm Cereal made by the Po-tum
Cereal Co. Li m., of Battle Creek, Mich., is
a pure, nourishing and strengthening
grain food-drink whic!> will answer very
well instead of coffee. .
If one is perfectly we! l, and can drink
coffee without its showing a disorder in
borne part of the body, they mk'ht not be
interested in Postum, but about every
other one is hurt by coffee, and there is
no denying the fact that the srreat food
drink is a boon to such. Properly pre-
pared it is toothsome and delicious.
"Just as good" as Postum Cereal are
words used to defraud the public.

LADY DIAMOND RAN
LIKE A LOBSTER
A Heavily Played Favor- j
ite, She Possessed No
Speed.
Mainstay, Winning at Odds of
ioo to i, Startled the Entire
Talent.
Morellito Again a Winner at a Juicy
Priceâ Veragua Came Strolling
In at 15 lo 1.
The racing at Ingleside track is rapidly
bordering on the fringe of society. After
the disgraceful showing made by Lady
I>:amend, carrying the black with red
maltese cross of E. J. Baldwin, the 6 to 5
favorite for the iast race, a six-furlong
ran, it is no wonder that the members of
the ring complain of a lack of play. On
Wednesday of last week this fast mare ran
second to Osarian, beaten but a length in ;
1:143^ for six furlongs. Yesterday she j
was a,6 to 5 choice and ridden by the well- j
known lightweight Tod Sloan did not pos
sess enough spÂ°ed to beat a broken-
Hearted and forlorn car horse. Away i
fairly well from the post she began fading
away almost from the start, eventually |
beating, hard ridden, the 300 to 1 shot La !
France, and the 600 to 1 chance Mahogany. :
On dismounting Jackey Sloan said that .
she had no speed, and he was undoubtedly :
ri^ht in his prognostication. Carrying
123 pounds, Mainstay, a lUO to 1 shot, made
ail the running and won cleverly from
Sallie- Clicquot.
It wr.s one of the most shamefaced exhi-
Utiona of the present meeting, and if
not thoroughly investigated racing will
soon become a dead letter. If a million- j
aire can run "lobsters," then a poor owner ',
is entitled to the same right. There is al- !
together too much partiality shown in the !
racing business, for all should be dealt with :
alike. The Baldwin horses have been a :
bane to racegoers from time immemorial,
and their disappearance from the turf al- j
tosether would be hailed with delizht.
The sport at the local track was ragged,
crotchety and altogether uncertain. Mr. j
Allen's pyrotechnical displays of starting ,
cause much adverse comment, and alto- i
gether the "Eastern innovations" men
tioned by A. 13. Spreckels in his letter of
jesignation from the presidency of the
Ingleside Association do not appear to be
fetching in the least.
Two rather abundantly backed favorites
WOB, with the other events run going to j
outsiders at all sorts of odds in the bet- j
ting. The attendance was fair with a :
very, very light disbursement of coin in 1
the ring.
Felix Carr, the ex-colored jockey, is no
longer a horse-owner. He started Mont- ;
gomery in the fourth event, a six furlong
dash, and at odds of 13 to 10 succeeded in
beating Amelia Fonso which acted as tem
porary starter, one length in a drive. The '.
pprinterwas enterpd to be sold for $200 '
and wasjbid up to $1000 by \V. P. Magraue,
owner of the second horse, at which i
figure Carr let his horÂ«e go.
btarter Ailen met with ill-success with
the machine in the opening four-furlong j
scramble for two-year-olds, leaving the 6 ;
to 5 favorite Key El fcalto, Flushington,
Little Dobbins aud Thyne at the post. !
Tiie winner turned up in the 20 to 1 shot ,
Morellito, ridden by Snider, which out- j
footed Barney Schreiber to the wire, win- I
ning by a head in 50 sec
Eddie Jones and Veragua. a 15 to 1 shot ;
backed down to 8, proved the >urprise in j
the mile and a furlong selling affair. The
outsider made the pace from the outset
and won eased up from Peter the Second,

WILL NOT INTERFEKE.
Police Department May D) Carpenter
Work If It So Desires.
The Health and Police Committee of
the Board of Supervisors decided yester
day to recommend that the board refuse
to interfere with the performance of car
penter work on its buiidings by the Police
Department.
The District Council of the Carpenters
and Joiners of San Francisco petitioned
the board some time a?o to order all of
the carpenter work of the Police Depart
ment cone by union men.
The committee said that it saw no good
reason why it should meddle with the
matter us long as the designing was done
by members of the department, and also
in view of the fact that the jobs done by
the police were comparatively insignifi
cant.
The petitioners were referred to the
Police Commissioners
Want a Sewerage 3 ygtem.
The Ocean View Improvement Club, by Its
secretary, M. F. Taylor, has petitioned the
Board of Supervisors to establish a sewerage
system iv the district known as Ocean View.
The fact that surface water collects in small
lakes in various places during the winter and
in summer becomes a menace to health and
an obstacle to traffic is cited la support of the
petition.

Editor Hoppsr Maintains the Writer
Is a Student, but Many Believe
Him an Inspired Outsider
BERKELEY, Cal.. March !'Â«.â Some
sensational rumors are current in univer
JAMES HOPPER, U. G, '9Z, Athlete, Student and Editor, Who
Is Responsible for the Article in the ** Occident " Which
Has Caused Such a Sensation in University Circles*
sity circles with regard to the latest fac
ulty roast of the Occident. The scathing
philippic of the paper's unknown corre
spondent is declared to have been in
spired and to be a part of an organized
movement having for its object the re
moval of Professor Kellogg from the
presidency of the university.
To-day the Occident's article was the
general topic of discussion in Berkeley
and much speculation was indulged in as
to the identity of Rienzi and his motive
for such a bitter attack upon the presi
dent.
The general verdict is that the writer j
was inspired by tnose who are desirous of j
seeing some other man in President Kel- j
logg's place. Four yeaxa ago, when ne i
was appointed, there was a lively contest !
for toe position, the other man most '
prominently named beinz Bernard Moses, j
professor of history and political science, j
The selection of Professor Kellogg was ie- I
garded as a compromise, and now the old |
fight against him is revived, though, it is |
said, those wno want a change desire to
see some Eastern man appointed to the
oflice.
The writer has been said to be a promi
nent member of the class 01 '95, who is
now taking post-graduate work at the j
university. He is an Oaklander, and dur- '
ing his under-graduiite years frequently
contributed to the college periodicals. It j
is not thought that any undergraduate
would dare to indite such remarks as those
of "Rienzi." One who had not got bis
sheepskin safely meted away would be in
danger of never setting it if he were known
to have given publicity to such opinions.
As it is Editor Hopper is thought to be in
danger of reprimand and perhaps suspen
sion, though he disclaims responsibility.
There was a general feeling of expec
tancy al! day at the university of a faculty j
summons to Hopper, and it was antici- j
pated t at he would be compelled to re- !
veal the name of his correspondent and I
that both editer and contributor would .
receive discipline. No action was taken, I
however. Tnere is still a likelihood that !
the matter wiil receive attention. It is
generally thought that if the mills of tha j
faculty are grinding slowly they wiil i
grind exceeding stiro, nnd the chances ol '
Hopper and the famous unknown for a I
t eriod of idleness, in which to think over j
the dancers and responsibilities of jour- i
nalism, are regarded as excellent.
Professors and students at Berkeley have
varying views of the subject so suddenly
brought forward. The existence of an
outs ide maturing influence is believed in
SEW TO-DAT.
Most torturing and disfiguring of itching, :
burning, scaly skin and scalp humors is in-
stantly relieved by a warm bath with Cuti-
cuka Soap, a single application of Cdticuea
(ointment), the great skin cure, and a full dose
of Cuticuba Resolvent, greatest of blood
purifiers and humor cures, when all else fails.

by all, and there are th^se who are dis
posed to think no student wrote "Ri
enzi's" article, in spite of Editor Hopper's
assertion that the author is a student.
The editor knows the writer, but deciine3
to reveal his identity.
Another startling statement made is
that alumni of the university are backing
Hopper and Riepzi, and have brought for
ward the tirade of abuse lor the afore-
mentioned impose of ousting President
KellogK. Those who are in the move
ment desire to see a young man of radical
ideas and policy at the head of the uni
versity. Such a one would control all
departments and do away with what is
called "departmental government."
Various members of the faculty were in
terviewed with regard to the article in
question and its fitness. Some agree with
â¢his policy in allowing the departments
considerable sway, while others have
views somewhat to the contrary. It is
the general opinion that the article for
the existence of which Editor Hopper is
responsible is untimely, unwarranted and
ill-advised. A number of those consulted
had no opinions to express, some had
opinions but would not allow them to be
published, while othere w?re more out
spouen. Following is what some of them
have to say :
Professor E. W. Hilgard, head of the
department of agriculture:
I can only express my extreme disapproval
of the article in question. It is untrue to be
gin with, and in liie second place such matters
should not be aired in public through the
columns of student journals. Tha whole
thing is based either on a misunderstanding
or a misrepresentation. The heads of depart
ments at ttie university have always desired
not only a strong president but also a strong
presidency. I should say emphatically that
the students here should not befoul their own
nest wirh such filth, especially since the State
has so very recently richly endowed the uni
versity Â«<nd has attempted in every way to in
crease the advantages of th-^ students for a
good education.
The faculty is accused of being mediocre.
Well, 1 should like to ask who it is that nave
made this university? It is certainly not the
regents, nor the students, but the faculty.
The thing that makes our university stand so
high in the rank of educational institutions is
the fact that its instructors and professors
have giren themselves to hard and conscien
tious labor.
With the statement that the faculty is in
competent falls the whole article, for the
premise is false, and so must be the conclu-
Bion.
The man who wrote the article should po
where he can enjoy this ideal university that
he pictures. The article does not appear on
its fnce to be the work of n student. There is
something malicious and deep-seated about it
that Ido not altogether understand. If that
stuff had been written at the time the Legisla
ture was in session I verily b?lieve it would
havedeteated the bill for the increase of the
university's appropriation.
Dr. Joseph La Conte, the veteran geolo
gist and tlie oldest member of the faculty,
having been identified with the university
for the past twenty- five years, was greatly
| surprised when thown the text of Hop-
I per'ti fusillade of invective.
He had seen the reports in the papers,
but tiad not read the article as it appeared
j over the norn de plume "Kienzi." As the
! venerable old scientist perused the lines
lie seemed appalled and knitted his brows
in astonishment. When he had finished
be said: "I do not like to be quoted, but
from the looks of things it seems to me
that Rienzi thinks he knows more about
running a university than the Board of
Regents themselves.
"As for my own views, I am a firm be
liever in the centralization of power, and
with the proper man at the head the more
cntralized the government the better.
With the proper Czar, the Czar's Govern
ment could be the most powerful on earth,
it is supposed that a university will be
criticized once in a while, but the criti
cism in question seems ill-advised. It is a
very cheeky kind of a thing for a college
j paper to doâ to come out so boldly and
j make so sweeping and so radical a cnti
' cism.
- Librarian Rawell, who is an early alum
nus of the institution, said:
It seems to me that every one, especially
the students, should he slow to express opin
j ions in print with regard to the university be
i fore they have considered the advisability of
' the proposed measure. Our student body has
I long been at fault with regard to criticism. I
| have not read the article in the Occident, but
| have seen accounts of it in the papers. The
j criticism may beâ l say it may beâ perfectly
j just, but it is rather a sweeping one. Any
' thing that should aTtse regarding our univer-
I sity policy should.be discussed at home. 'We
! should wath our own soiled linen. â  / ,- : 'â  â 
There seems to be a completely erroneous
I idea at large with regard to our- university,
; largely brought about by the airing in public
I of our affairs, which should be kept at home.
I I am sure the professors are willing to receive
j criticism, and adverse criticism, too, but the
I spirit in which these criticisms are received
will depend much upon the spirit in which
they were given. -
Professor Carl C. Plehn:
The author of the article appears to believe
that the departments at the university are too
independent. He assumes that the present
situation Is a bad one, but does not prove what
he says. â¢ '-.â â '. .: 'â¢ - t :\
As to the criticism that the policy of the
president is a poor one, in not exerting
authority over the departments, I will say that
it is ill grounded.
The president has a definite policy, and, in
my opinion, it is a pood one. â¢â¢ He has. during
his four years of office, kept things running
smoothly and has kept peace in the faculty
family. That policy has allowed the rapid de
velopment of the latent strength of each de
i partment, and possibly gives the university as
j good service from the departments as could be
I had in any other way. My feeling is that
| President Kellogg has a better knowledge of
the needs of the university and . its past than
almost any other person, and consequently
his choice of 'Aat policy is evidence, to lay
mind, of its advisability.
. Inspector Shina of the forestry stations
said:
I have no opinion on the merits of the ar
ticle. I will say, however, that I believe the
function of a university to be continuous de
velopment along new lines. The more we do to
develop a university along new lines and to
put more life into it the more will we be bene
fited.
Colonel George C. Edwards:
All I have to say is that the article is ill ad
vised. I am not saying anything about the
truth or the falsity of the statements, but they
are out of place in a student publication. The
discussion of such matters should be carried
on out oi prim.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 27, 1897.
CORBETT IS IN
TRAINING AGAIN
He Says He Will Certainly
Get Another Match
With Fitz.
Begins Work at the Olympic
Club and Will Continue
It Indefinitely.
The Ex-Champion Argues That the
Public Will Rise Up and De
mand a S cond Battle.
Ex-champion James J. Corbett has gone
into training again.
Although no articles of agreement have
been signed, nor any definite arrange
ments for a battle consummated, still
"Gentleman Jim" assertsâ and with ap
parent sincerity â that he practical!)' has
another match on with the new champion
of the world. Robert Fitzsimraons.
Corbett argues that the Cornishman
will be compelled to re-enter the ring, for
tfte alleged reason that despite hia new
laurels and glory be cannot make a living
at anything eise. Then, once he pro
claims his return to the arena, the public
will demand that he try his mettle once
more aeainst the man of the pompadour
rather than picK up any of the so-called
second raters.
Jim has chosen to convince Himself that
he will meet Fitz again within the ropes
inside of a year.
Corbett inaugurated his new system
of training yesterday afternoon at the
Olympic Club. He put in one and a half
hours at handball with Al Hampton, the
clnb's champion, who assisted the ex
champion dunnc his training at Carson.
After that Jim went up into t:ie gym
nasium and boxed for a short while with
several of the heavier members. His
work with the gloves wa^ of the gingerly
order, however, for his knuckles are stilt
sore and bruised â a legacy from the recent
great battle in Nevada. Corbett next took
a turn at t c wrist machine and chest
weights and then finished up with a
three-mile run on the indoor track and a
swim.
"Yes, I am in training again for Fitz
simmons," said Corbett when seen in his
dressing-room. "This is not cxc usive
either. I trained hard and earnestly for
that Carson fight, but I am going to work
even harder this time. I propose to keep
it up at least a year, for 1 don't expect to
cet Fitzsimrnons in the ring again much
sooner, and if lie holds off longer than
that why I will extend my training season
accordingly. In other words I propose to
train until I meet him.
"Do I think I will get another match?
Why, of course I do. Fitz may be sincere
enough now about his determination to
retire from the ring for good, but it will be
only a question of time when he will have
to return to it He is programming his
future at present on a belief that he is go
ing to make barrels of money on the road
bpcause of o*ing the world's champion,
but be will soon have to abandon that
because of its unprofitableness.
"Fitz never could cet the people to come
to h's exhibitions and he never will, de
spite li is new laurels. What will be the
result? Why, he will have to tight again,
that's all. That being the case, who has
lirst call on him for a couteii ? 1 tell you
the public will demand that he meet me
asrniii. No-club will be foolish enough to
offer a purse for a battle between Fitz and
any of me second-rate ciass. and if it
should the public would certainly not pay
to -cc the contest, because the outcome
would be rractically a foregone conclu
sion. Mark my word for it, there is going
to be another tight, or else Fitzsimmons
will have to get out of public Jile alto
gether, and if there is another right you
will see me once more the champion of
the world."
Corbatt will continue his daily training
at the Olympic Club so long as he re
mains in San Francisco, and he will re
sume it, he says, aÂ« soon as ho reaches the
East. Upon arriving at New York Wil
liam A. Brady, t!ie ax-champion's backer
and manager, will immediately issue a
challenge to Fitzsimmons for a second fin
ish right, and accompany it with a deposit
of $2500. The programme then wiil be a
theatrical tour of the continent, and a
systematic bantering of the victorious
Cornishman from every stopping-place.
The latter will serve as good and inexpen
sive advertising lor lh<i Corbett- Brady
show, even should Fitzsimmons persist in
adhering to the promise he made his wife
that he would never tight Again.
Both Fitzsimmons and his manager,
Martin Julian, took a humorous view of
Corbett's latest move when informed of it.
"That's all right; Jim has a right to do
as he pleases" said Julian. "Nobody can
blame him for doing everything ha can 10
bring about another forlorn chance to win
back his laurels. I don't want to say any
thing mure about what I believe to bo Cor
bett's real motives, because since the Car
son affair he has actad v.cry decently with
us and has resorted to no blurting or blow
ing; but so far as Fitz is concerned he has
announced his retirement from the ring,
and I guess he will stay bj that declara
tion."
Bob Fitzsimmons spent most of yester
day in the company of his wife. In the
morning he visited Bddie Oreany's horse
sboeing-shop and turned out a few horse
shoes. After that he and Mrs. Fitz went
out for a drive and later made a trip across
the bay. '
PURE FOOD.
The Chief Food Inspector Speak*.
The following letter from â  Inspector
Dockery speaks in no uncertain terms of
malicious newspaper articles on this sub
ject, so full of interest to all:
San Francisco Health Department,);

Messrs. Goldberg, Bowen & Co., Cityâ.
Gentlemen: In regard to a report in. the
KyemiiK Bulletin of the 25ih lust! that the
City Chemist had examined food from
your firm which was pronounced unlit for
food, we desire publicly to stale that such
was not the case. l he chemist found
some apple juice in a jar of entrant' jelly
bought at your store, but neither he nor
any one else "connected with this depart
ment pronounced it unfit for food ; nor
authorized any such statement. The,
article referred to was without doubt the
result of animosity, and will be so recog
nized by most readers. In justice to you
as well as to this department I send you
this letter. Respectfully yours, : j 4;"

Chief Food and Milk Inspector.
; The Chronicle remarked editorially yes
terday : ''It is not ; conceivable that a
grocery house such as that of Goldberg,

its customers. . .' ;
"A properly equipped laboratory, where
suspicious articles offered by retailers for

and reported upon, is highly desirable."
WAGON AND CAR COLLIDE.
A Driver Injured and a Big Load of
Passengers Badly Jarred.
Ellis-street car No. 337, loaded with pas
sengers bound for the theater, and a
wagon of the Commercial Trannfer Com-
I'uuy had a mix-up at the corner of Ellis
and Polk streets last evening, which for a
time caused great consternation in the
vicinity, but the damage was not sprious.
Tlie driver of the waeon, Henry Ilusac,
who resides at 337 Turk street, was hurled
to the ground and sustained a severe
sprain of his left knee. The front win
dows of the car were shattered, several
passengers were badly jolted and most of
them were considerably frightened.
MANY GYMNASTIC fEATS.
Young Men nml Young Women Give a
Lively Inhibition at the Y. M. C. A.
A lively, diversified and much-ap
plauded gymnastic entertainment, parti
cipated in by eigbtv-rive performers, fif
teen of them young women in fetching
bloomer attire, was given last night in
the Y. M. C. A. gymnasium before several
hundred spectators, about all that the
seating space would accommodate.
There was a lone programme, accom
panied by orchestral music. The first ex
hibition "of particular note was a unique
and picturesque procession of representa
tives, each in appropriate costume, of all
branches of athletic sport from the indoor
acrobat in icant attire to the nimrod, the
football piayer ana the oarsman. These
were preceded by a grotesque non-musi
cal band.
The rhythmical Indian dub swinging of
Adele Edna Kellogg, a pretty, graceful
little miss of 10, attired in a white flannel
bloomer suit, was one of the events of the
evening. A company of young women in
navy blue bloomers with enormous white
sailor coilars went through some very ef
fective evolutions in marching and evolv
ing fancy iigures and an Indian club drill.
But the club-swinging of the evening was
exhibited by Dr. D. L. Dietz, the in
structor, wnb with illuminated and flash
ing clubs went through a variety of move
ments with iightninc-lite rapidity. The
statuary posing.representing all manner of
athletes in action, and the tumbling of
the Akro-Quad, were among the other
commendable performances.
E. M. MORGAN LEVANTS.
The Prominent Attorney Myster
iously Disappeared Ten
Days Ago.
Owes Somewhere iv the Neighbor
hood of $10,000â Hs Wife
Very LI.
A multitude of creditors, whose varions
claims aggregate the snug little sum of
about $10,000, are anxiously searching for
E. M. Morgan, one of the well-known
attorneys of this City. Their search,
however, promises to be a futile one, and
all concede that he has levanted for parts
unknown, probably never to return.
The man of law has not been seen by
his family or friends for ten days, and no
one can be found who is willing to explain
the- mystery of his disappearance.
It is presumed that Mr. Morgan's flight
is due to the fact that he was heavily in
debt and was unable to liquidate. Inves
tigation proves that such property as he
possesses is covered by mortgages given
in security for notes. It wus known that
he was cramped for funds, but it was
thought, huwever. that iv a short time he
would be able to meet bis obligations.
This belief proved erroneous, and about
ten days ago Morgan left the City.
The attorney's wife is lying quite ill at
her residence, 210(4 Broadway. She is also
at a loss to understand her husband's ab
sence, but is confident that he will return
soon and adjust iiis affairs.
H. S. Commsky, wnÂ«?n he heard of Mor
gan's absence, took possession of the at
torney's offices, 14 Sanaome street, and
claimed the furniture as security for an
overdue mortgage. I. J. Truman also vis
ited the offices and too* possession of cer
tain papers that were in Morgan's safe.
Mr. Truman states that he ia unable to
give any reason for Morgan's disappear
ance otlier than that he did so 10 escape
bis creditors, and all cf the creditors
auree.
SCALPERS ARE SAFE.
The Supervisors Say They Are in a
Legitimate Business for the
Public Good.
Tho License and Orders Committee of
the Board of Supervisors reported last
night on the railroad ticket order as fol
lows:
Your committee now report unfavorably
upon the same uud Against the passage of any
order prohibiting tne business of railroad
ticket-brokers, for ihe reason that such busi
ness is lor the advantage and benefit of the
people, and not in any manner a business
which is against public morals. By moans of
thl* business the traveling public is en ft Died
to procure In a perfectly legitimate manner a
reduction of railroad lares which cannot be
procured by any ottier means. The railroad
companies are already thoroughly protected
by law against any forgery or other wrongful
use of railroad tickets, and therefore it is our
opinion that any law prohibiting proper
ticket brokerage should not be carried into
effect.
The report was adoptee*.
THE CHECK NO GOOD.
A Dry-Goods Clerk Arrested for Pass
. ing Worthless Paper. .
F. A. Backer, a dry-goods clerk, who
claims to be at present employed at Cur
tin's establishment on Market street, near
Fifth, was arrested last evening on com
plaint of J. L. Argoud for passing a ficti
tious check.
. Areoud is proprietor of a restaurant at
the corner of Mason and Geary streets.
The cheok in question, which purports to
be for $17 50, drawn on the Bank of Gilroy,
was given him by Bacber. Argoud took
it to a local bank, wnere it was pro
nounced worthless.
Bacher claims to have resided at Gilroy
for some time. He told the arresting offi
cers, Crockett and Dillon, conflicting
stories in regard to toe possession of the
check.
NO MOKE "SPITTEE."
Chinese I.aumlrymen Get Into Trouble
for Violating an Ordinance.
The heathen Chinee is conservative. When
the edict wont forth that hereafter some other
means of spraying clothes tnan that at which
John has become adept must be adopted, the
Chinese laundries were slow to tuko the hint.
Yesterday ull patrolmen were instructed to be
on the lookout for violations of this order.
The result was disastrous to the launclrymen.
From all over town summons were received
during tne day for patrol-wagons, and by 8
o'clock scores oi arrests had been made. The
Chinese were all held in $100 bonds or $50
cash bail, and there was a great skurrying
among I'olicu Court lawyers to secure releases.
It was announced that arrests would also be
maae for expectorating on the streets or in
otner public places, but this portion of the
ordinance was apparently lost track of.

attorney, Eugene N. Deuprey. and Mrs.
A. P. d'Artenay, formerly Sarah Maguire,
now of Dixon, the mother of the child.
was in court with Attorney Matt L
Sullivan.
Several witnesses were examined, includ
ing Sarah Thrasher, Lucinda Holstrom,
A. P. d'Artenay, Bert Joy and Charles
Holstrcm. The doors of the courtroom
were closed to the public.
Mrs. Holstrom acknowledged that she
had joined in a plan to deceive her hus
band, who was iv Oregon, and to make
him believe that the child was hers. Sub
sequently her husband was informed of
the parentage of the child, and said he
thought all the more of it because it was a
little waif.
A. P. d'Artenay. husband of the mother
of the child, testified that he is a black
smith in business for himself. He is a re
spectable man of prosperous appearance,
and no one doubted his word when he
testified that he was able and willing to
support the child in a proper manner.
Bert Joy gave some testimony against
Mrs. Holstrom âwhich, if true, would be
damagingâ touching her actions since she
has* had custody of the child.
Charles Holstrom testified that he has
supplied ample means for the support of
his wife and was willing to have her Keep
the little girl.
In the afternoon the doors were opened.
The courtroom was quickly filled with
women, and William A. Lighthall was
called to the witness-stand. He is the
father of Mrs. Holstrom, and said his
daughter had ?hown great affection for
the little girl ; that she had worked for her
early and late, and he thought she would
lay down her life for the child. He said
that Mrs. d'Artenay showed no affection
.'or the child.
Mr. Sullivan tried to obtain some infor
mation in recard to the burning of his
property in fcacramento and also in this
City, nnd the record touching the insur
ance, but the court said such testimony
was immaterial. The witness said his
daughter has lived witu him for two years
and that she is a good woman.
Mrs. Lighthal!, mother of Mrs. Hol
strom, was the next witness. She said
she and her daughter went together to ob
tain the child from Mrs. d'Artenay, then
Bailie M agin re, and that Miss Maeuire
seemed glad to have Mrs. Holstromget
the baby. She said: "I would rather
have you get her than to have her sent to
a foundling asylum. I feel as if God hail
directed you to me. It's a godsend forme
and the baby."
Some controversy arose between Mr.
Sullivan and Mr. Deuprey in regard to an
alleged conspiracy involving Mrs. d'Arte
nay, Dr. Thrasher" and Mrs. Thrasher to
get possession of the child.
Mr. Sullivan said he was willing to let
that go in if he were allowed to inquire
into the tire insurance conspiracy, but
Judge Seawell ruled it all out.
Then Mr. Deuprey \vantâ¬d a description
of what ne termed "'the brutal conduct of
Officer Frank Kane in dragging the child
from Mrs. Holstrom's aims," but the
court remarked that Officer Kane's alleged
brutality had nothing to do with the
claims of the vpmen for the custody of
the child.
Mrs. Lighthall was' shown the contract
in which Sally Maguiro, as the mother of
the child was then known, gave permis
sion for Mrs. Holstrom to keep the child
and to adopt it as her own. The witness
said.tne document was delivered in ncr
presence. Mrs. d'Artenay acknowledges
signing the deed of gift to Mrs. Holstrom
ana says she had no thoup bt of asking for
the child again until she heard that Mrs.
Holstrom wanted to get rid of it.
When Bert Joy was recalled to the wit
ness-stand he had to run the gantlet of
looks of scorn that were showered against
him by all the women present. Even
those who were not friendly to Mrs. Hol
strom manifested their contempt for the
person who volunteered such testimony as
he gave.
F. L. Holbrook testified that Mrs.
Thrasher complained to him about Mrs.
Holstrom in last August and September.
As secretary of the Society for tho Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children he took a
policeman and made an investigation. He
was not permitted to say whether or not
he considered her a good woman, but it
was developed that he took no steps to
deprive her of the custody of the chi.d.
Mrs. Olive Arnold and Miss Bessie Gay
nor testified to conversations with Bert
Joy, in which he spoke of Mrs Holstrom
as a good woman. Miss Gaynor said he
told her Hint Mrs. Thrasher had written
him a letter asking him to testify against
Mrs. Holstrom. Joy disputed this state
ment.
Mra. Eva Strickland and Mrs. May Hil
dreth, sisters of Mrs. Holstrom, corrobo
rated tho testimony of Mr. and Mrs.
Lighthall and of Mrs. Holstrom in dis
puting the testimony of Bert Joy.
Mrs. Hil'lreth, who is a member of the
Salvation Army, swore that sue was pres
ent when Mrs. Holstrom started to
Oregon with the infant four years ago,
and that Mrs. Holsironi said she was
â¢orry to take the baby so far away from
its mother, whereupon the mottier replied:
"Thai's all right, the baby has given me
trouble enough already. I hope never to
see it again."
Further testimony â¢will be heard by
Judge Seawell at naif-past 10 o'clocK this
morning, and if the attendance of women
increases a larger courtroom will have to
be obtained; even standing-room was at a
premium yesterday.

Jimmy Anthony visited The Call office
last evening ami stated that be had made
no sucb proposition as was published in a
morning paper, to the effect that he re

A WATER FAMINE
ON THE HEIGHTS
Unheeded Petitions From
Residents of "Scotch
Hill."
Compelled to Pay Water Rates
With No Equivalent
in Return.
An Elevation Which Is Abuve the
Spring Valley Water
L vel.
That section of the Potrero known as
'Scotch Hill," otherwise the Southern
Height", is up in arms against the Spring
Valley Water Company because that cor
poration has lor years neglected and re
fused to place a reservoir in such an ele
vated position as would give the residents
a sufficient water supply.
This grievance assumed sufficient grav
ity among t!ie people to cause thorn to
organize themselves into a. protesting
club, which wa* effected at a meeting held
iast night at 1514 Twentieth street, (for
merly Napa).
George Aspbem was elected temporary
chairman and Frect Schutz was honored
with the office of secretary. After a lew
preliminaries the club settled down to
the importance of the occasion, which was
a general cry for "water."
James T. Hamilton opened the proceed
ings by stating that he had appeared be
fore the Supervisors to voice the wants of
himself and his neighbors on the water
question. In response to his laments,
bupervisors Thomas Morton and Dr.
Clinton visited the Heights and, with a
test eanÂ«e borrowed from Mr. Scott of
the Union Iron Works, demonstrated the
fact that on the top of Twentieth and
Missouri streets the water pressure did not
exceed 10 pounds. This test was made on a
Sunday, at a time when the full pressure
of the Kentucky-street main was at its
heisrht. On week days, when the engi/.es
ot the various manufacturing institutions
are in operation, the pressure does not
average live pounds, a pressure entirely
inadequate to force the water into tbe
kitchens on the ground floors of any of
the bouses on the Heishts.
Peter J. Smith of 542 Arkansas street
made out a worse case ihan Hamilton by
stating that he was charged $10 by the
water company to connect his service
pipes with those of the company, and in
return he never drew a single pint of water
from the pipes. On the contrary, he had
paid A. Raymond $2 a month for water for
the use of his family, which was supplied
from a windmill tank, but the water
had to be hand pumped from another
tank in his yard daily after his bard day's
work. A similar condition of affairs was
the case with R. B. Scott, who had to do
hand pumping also, although he paid $1 50
a month to the water company without
receiving any equivalent therefor. Â«B|
Tim Connors stated that for four con
secutive days last summer he could not
secure water enough to wash his face.
This line of complaint was eeneral
among the entire gathering, all stating
that when their wives intended to do
washing that they had to collect sufficient
water during the nights preceding that
healthful intention.
Those who reside on the topmost point
of the Heights, which is Wisconsin and
Twenty-second streets, have long since
given up hope of ever getting any water
from the service pipes of the water com
pany. They simply console themselves
by carrying their supply from Raymond's
tank at so much per month. As a balm
of solace the following letter was read
from Supervisor Clinton :
San Francisco. March 16, 1897.
James F. Hamiltonâ My Pear Sir: I have
been after the Spring Valley Water Company,
and yesterday Mr. Souussler told me that the
company had purchased a site for a reservoir
in your vicinity, and tiiat beiore many months
your section would be abundantly supplied
witb pure water. Kindly make known this
news to your neighbors. Yours sincerely,
C A. Clinton.
One member of the club unintention
ally made mention of the word "sewer." i
Thii caused a general laugh all round, I
with the answer, "What would be the use A
of a sewer without water to flush it."
A vote of thanks was tendered Supervi
oors Morton and Clinton for their visit to
the Heights.
In Norway people who are not vaccin
ated are not allowed to vote at an elec
tion.
