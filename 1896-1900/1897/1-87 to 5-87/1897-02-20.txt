ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, Feb. 19 â
Russia, it is said, is prepared to bring
about the forcible expulsion of the Greek
torpedo flotif^ from Cretan waters and
the disarmament of the Greek troops in
Crete and a blockade of the Greek coasts
if the Hellenic Government persists in its
imprudent attitude. If Greece goes to
war with Turkey she will bÂ« left to fight
her battles alone.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Feb. 19.â
It is reported here (hat l'hotidaes Pasha,
the provisional successor to Georee Ber
ovitch Pasha as the Christian Governor of
Crete, has declined to continue to dis
charge the duties of that office, and that
Karatheodori Pasha will be appointed to
the governorship of the island.
The Turkish squadron in Italian waters
will consist nominally of nine ironciaas
and twenty-five torpedo-boats.
A report is in circulation here that Lord
Salisbury and the Marquis di Rudini, the
British and Italian Prime Miuisiaj*. have
recommended that the powers agree to
I grant autonomy to Crete upon lines
similar to those upon which autonomy
was given to the island of Samoa, the
affairs of the island to be administered
under the rule of a Greek Prince. Until
the completion of these arrangements, the
.British and Italian Premiers' agreement
permits the continuation of the present
status quo.
The report that Lord Salisbury, the
British Prime Minister, had sent a cir
cular note to the powers favoring the
granting of autonomy to Crete, with a
Prince of Greece to administer the affairs
of the island, is confirmed.
< ANKA, Crete, Feb. 19.â Moslems have
abandoned Voucoulis and have retreated
to Alikianos, where they are now sur
rounded. Fighting is now going on there.
â¢ . A crowd of Moslems marched to-day to
the military headquarters here and de
manded that they be furnished with arms
in order to relieve their comrades. Mar
tini rifles and ammunition were given to
them and they marched out of the city.
Later lighting occurred on the hills near
the city, witn no decisive results on either
side.
The Austrian Vice-Consul at Heralion
confirms the report of the massacre of
2000 Moslems by Cretan Christians at
Sitia, the eastern extremity of the island.
Colonel Vassos, commanding the Greek
forces in Greta, has given orders to the
troops to refrain :rora molesting or giving
offense to civilians and unarmed Moslems.
The Greek consulate is now being guarded
by Russian marines. TheCousu!, in com
plying with the orders to withdraw the
â  Greek guard, protested that the admirals
were exceeding their functions.
ATHENS. Grezce, Feb. 19.â A dispatch
from Canea states that three of the great
powers are in favor of a union between
Crete and Greece.
1 It is reported that King George will ap
\>*bl to the Hellenic race for a great na
t/onal loan to meet the expenses of the
military and naval preparations.
A British ironclad has prevented the
Bteamer JunÂ«n from embarking provis
ions intended for the use of the Ore k
â¢tr.oops in Crete.
The military preparations on the part of
Greece continue. Two more classes of the
reserves have been called out. The King
openly favors resistance to the demands
of the powers.
la the course of a debate in the Cham
ber oi Deputies last evening Premier
Delyannis stated that the Government
was seeking to discover the reason for the
powers opposing the operations of Greece
in Crete.
. As a result of the investigations the
Cabinet had arrived at certain conclusions
which could not be communicated to the
' Ji amber further than to declare that
Greece would persist In its policy and
course of action in Crete.

COLLIS WILL PAY TO SAVE THE CHARTER.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 19.â For months Attorney-General Taylor has been getting up data upon which to base an
action against the Southern Pacific Company for a franchise tax. This corporation received its charter from the Kentucky
.Legislature in 18H4 with its authorized capital of $1,000,000. with the right to increase it to any amount, now thougut to he be
â¢ tween $150,000,000 and $200,000,000. Although a Kentucky corooration it has done no business in this State, or but very little.
Jlt has never r aid anything as taxes. It has Oeen operating in other States, buyin X Government, State, county and municipal
bonds and operat ng railroads. The Attorney-General contends that under sections 4<i2o and 4077 of the Kentucky statutes
this corporation should report and pay a franchise tax; also a tax on all its personal property, no matter where located. Tne
domicile of the corpomtion is in this State, and hence a correspondence has been carried on between the corporation and the
Attorney-General Jor some weeks. Last week Mr. Dav;e of Louisville, the company's attorney, waÂ» here to confer with the
Attorney-General, and went directly to New York to confer with members of the corporation. This morning the Attorney-
General was telegraphad to postpone a suit and that it was thought the whole matter could be adjusted without litigation as
coon as Mr. Davie returned. The amount the road will be called upon to Day will be about $250,000, which includes the tax for
â¢11 the years since the franchise tax law went into effect. It is said Huntington has made this play to prevent the repeal of
toe charter at the extra session.
The San Francisco Call
in Crete, has been stopped and turned
back by a British cruiser. The action of
the British vessel has created the fiercest
indignation here.
LONDON, BUG , Feb. 19.â 1n the House
of Commons to-day, George N. Curzon,
UDder Foreign Secretary, said in answer
to questions that the Porte had not an
nounced any intention to send troops to
Crete. The general advice of the powers
to Turkey was to abstain from precipitat
ins action. Detachments of marines
from the foreign warships were now occu
py in i Canea, Sitia and Retimo, and it was
probable the; would soon occupy other
Cretan ports. In addition to this the
British, Russian and Italian Consuls had
gone to Salino for the purpose of prevent
ing further outrages there, and to relieve
the suffering of Moslem families.
.lames Low her, Conservative, asked
what steps had been taken to relieve th â 
Moslems in the interior. Curzon replied
that the powers were doing all thai they
possibly could to relieve them.
In its issue to-morrow the Tirres will
condemn Colonel Vassoe, the commander
of the Greek corps of occupation in Crete,
for taking ihe offensive and attacking the
Turkish outi os aan PlaUnia. It says that
if King George and the Greek Govern
ment encourage Colonel Vas>sos they will
have to reckon with the powers, which
are demanding :ne adoption of energetic
measures against Greece. To re^i-jt the
warning that has been given by the pow
ers would be sher folly.
PARIS, France, Feb. 10.â Le Temps
Bays that the powers are resolved to speak
firmly to the Government at Athens
solely from hdeliiy to the tradition that
France and Great Britain wish to exhaust
all means of conciliation before consent
ing to the other measures so urgently de
manded by the courts allied to the Greek
dynasty.
Fifteen hundred students took part to
night in a Grecophile procession, which
ended in a conflict with ihe gendarmes.
The procession, which was held at a iate
hour, was a disorderly one, and when the
gendarmes attempted to make the stu
uents behave themselves a tight occurred,
in which two of the gendarmes were
wounded. Eighty of the students were
arrested.
IASISI FIGHTS FOR FREEDOM.
The Turkish Consul Claims That Treaty
and Constitution Are Violated in
Hs Case.
NEW YORK, Is. V., Feb. 19.â Turkish
; Consul Joseph A. lasigi, accused of era
( bezzlement in connection with his trustee
ship of certain estates, and awaiting re
moval to Boston, was before Judge Audi-
I son Brown of the United States District
\ Court to-day on a writ of habeas corpus.
1 The petition for the writ was made by
'. Consul lasigi, who claims his detention is
in violation of the constitution of the
j United States and of the treaty of 1830 be
tween tbe Government of the United
States and the Government of his Impe
! rial Majesty the Sultan of the Ottoman
' Empire.
The petition goes on to say that lasigi
\ is held in custody wholly without author
ity of jurisdiction, by reason of the (act
j that he, as Consul-General. is subject only
Ito Federal jurisdiction. The Consul says
that he is charged with having committed
in the commonwealth of Massachusetts
on the Ist of July, 1802. the crime of em
: bezzlement, while agent for Pierre Charles
Derieux, of about $6000, but that several
j years have elapsed since the alleged em
: bezzlement and yet tie has never been in
â  dieted by a Grand Jury, nor is there any
proof that he is a fugitive from justice.
On the other hand it is claimed that sub
division 8 of section 771 of the revised
j statutes, under whicn the Consul claims to
be amenable only to Federal jurisdiction,
was repealed in 1874. At the hearing to
day counsel of lasi^rsaid the question be
j fore tne court is whether the State courts
had jurisdiction.
After Judge Brown had heard the argu
; ments of both sides counsel was given
until Wednesday next to submit briefs in
the case.

Campaign
KEY WEPT, Fla., Feb. 10.â A passen
ger arrived on the steamer ArÂ»n-as to-day
who, on authority, is said to have come
, from an extensive trip through th-. 1 contra,
provinces âSanta Clan, Matanzas and
Havana â and he gives the impression of
; nis journey in the following terms:
The ruin and desolation was frightful to
witness, he said, tbe country being bare
and wasted, canelields and plantations
burned and little vestige of the country
homes remaining exC' v: thosesione-built,
whose blackened walls only are standing
Tnatched huts were but heaps of a-ho>;
villages, towns and cities were partially
destroyed, but crowded with miserable,
forlorn people, with emaciated, hungry
looking faces. Ti.ey were all huddled in
small spaces, without commodities, with
no hyuiene, and suffering from diseases
beyond all description and dying by hun
dreds daily. Ail this state of things was
brought about by Weyler's brutal and in
human decree ordering the concentration
of the country people in the town-. Such
is the terror that Wey.er inspires that the
mere fact of his approach creates conster
nation and alarm to all the people, who
rush to the nearest town for protection.
Near Sancti Spiritus, a place named
Guayo, a column of Spanish troops when
passing last Friday, after killing all the
cattle, set fire to the buildings and ranches
and butcher-d t:.e owner, a planter named
Ramon Napole, a man of independent
means, well known and esteemed in that
district. This was reported as a rebel
camp, captured and destroyed. The same
column found a party of rebels lying in
ambush. After a desperate fight a Cuban
officer. Lieutenant Perez, and his men es
caped.
From reliable sources it is learned that
Gomez will now initiate a more vigorous
rampai.n. After arranging with the Cu
ban Government the plans and purposes
of his future movements, Gomez ordered
a conr entration of all the rebel forces pre
paratory to his advance into the we- tern
province. His first step was to and the
Cv an Government bick to Cubitas with
headquarters in Camagu.iv. The party
s arted with an oscort of 200 men and suc
cessfully crossed the central troeba Satur

BETRAYEIt Â»I A HPT.
Arrest of an American for Astittinq a
Woman to Ear tptt.
NEW YORK, N. V., Fob. 19.â A dis
patch to the Sun from Havana says: In
addition to Dr. Emiliano Nunez, whose
arrest was reported a few days ago, sev
eral otber well-known persons have been
cast into jail in Havana, accused of aiding
the revolution. Their imprisounieut has
created a great sensation, not only be
cause they have many relatives and
friends in the capital, but also on account
of the extraordinary circumstances which
mnected with their prosecution.
An American citizen, Mr. Scott, a resi
dent of Kegla, a small town across tbe
bay from Havana, and who was arrested
also, is under s.milar charges and is being
even more sternly prosecuted by the Span
i>h authorities, because he is accused of
helping the Cuban woman, Ana Sotolongo,
:o escape from prison.
Mr. Scott, as well v â¦b' others, was de
nounced to the Si>*uishL JM'.koriuei), hm all
the Cubans here aftirm, by a man named
Miguel Beto, wbo, from the very begin
ning of the revolution, acted here as an
ajfnt of the revolutionary junta of New
York and at tirst did good work for the
Cv an came. Some months ago tbe
Cubans in New York, as well as hÂ»re, ob
served that Beto had begun to behave
strangely.
SeTdral other prominent residents of
PI ;i van a, now deported to the Chafarinas
Islands, were arrested here as representa
tives of the Junta. No evidence could be
found against them, but Weyler declared
that he was certain of their connection
with the revolution and reused to parden
one of them, even when asked to do so by
the influential Spaniard, Don Manuel
Calvo.
Soon it was kuown that a traitor belong
ing to the Junta at New York had de
nounced them, and public opinion pointed
to Miguel Beto as the guilty man. Beio
protected, and continued to pose among
the Cubans as a revolutionist, and as his
position had previously been so promi
nent among the patriots here, and a* some
of his friends denied the accusations
against him, he won again the confidence
of those who were here for the independ
ence of Cuba in the very stronghold of
b;aiu. In this way he cams into posses
sion of important secrets. The result is
now another denunciation attributed to
him, in which an American is involved,
and which has aroused intense indigna
tion here among the Cubans.
The Spanish police discovered about a
year ago in a house in San Rafael street a
quantity of explosives and other muni
tions of war destined for tha Cubans.
Several persons were arrested, among
them a woman of good family named Ana
Sotolongo, who was immediately locked
up in the house ior disreputable women.
As no evidence couli be obtawied by the
Spaniards, the trial of the prisoners, as
nsual in these cases, was indefinitely de
layed, and Ana Sotolongo was kept in her
cell suffering day after day tbe many
privations and insults.
The patriotic woman had friends, how
ever, in the city who were trying to aid
her to escape. When all th â  plans to aid
her were ready she escaped by jumping
from a window to the street, only to be
later discovered by the Spanish police in
a house on Yirtudes street and rearrested.
Her presence there had been cart-fully con
cealed and she was awaiting an opportu
nity to join one of tUe revolutionary
forces near Havana, and from there ex
pected to be sent to Key West or some
other place in toe United dtates in a spe
cial boat. Only the member? of the Junta
here and Beto knew where she was. Beto
is accused again of denouncing Ana Soto
longo and the others as her accomplices.
Scott is highly esteemed here, and if he
had anything to do with the escape o;
Ana Sotolonpo it was only because he
sympathized with the woman in her terri
ble position.
Consu!-General Lee has interfered in
his behalf and has asked for Scott a civil
trial.

CANTON, Ohio. Feb. 19.â Two impor- I
tant pieces of political news were devel- <
oped here to-day. One is that James A.
Gary of Baltimore has been offered and
has accepted a position in Major McKin
ley's Cabinet. The other is that J. J. Me-
Cook of New York, who is being favora- L
bly considered by Major McKinly in;
connection with a Cabinet position, has j
not been offered a portiolio, nor has Mr. i
McCook been definitely determined upon
for a Cabinet position, and if he does be
come a meniDer of the Cabinet it is not
absolutely certain that he will be the j
Attorney-General, or that Mr. Gary will
be made Postmaster-General. This is on
high authority.
When the announcement of the Cabinet
is made it may seem well to the President
elect to transfer ex-Governcr Long, whom
he has fixed upon for the Navy Dercrt
ment to the Department of Justice, leav
ing the Navy portfolio for a New York
man or for Mr. Gary in case it is decided
to give the Postmaster-Generalship to
New York.
Mr. Gary has been an active Republican
worker in Maryland for more than fifteen
years, and for a long period was a mem
ber of the Republican National Committee
lrom that State. Major McKinley has
known him for fifteen years, and has
deemed him one of the foremost business
men of the South.
Major McKinley is improving rapidly in
health, but adheres firmly to his resolu
tion to see no visitors save those who come
by appointment. The only caller he haa
received this wÂ»ek was Mr. Gary.

Gary of Baltimore has been tendered the
position of Postmaster-General in Presi
dent-elect MeKinley's Cabinet. He said
so himself at the Union station to-night,
where he stopped off for dinner on his
way to Baltimore from his visit to Major
McKinley in Canton, on the invitation of
the latter.
After admitting that he had been ten
dered a Cabinet place a reporter askert
him, "Then I may say you will accept?"
"No," he answered, "you will be sure of
that in just about two days."
When asked whether the Cabinet of
President-elect McKiniey would be made
up as rsported, Mr. Gary answered that
be could not talk on that or any other po
litical subject.
"In a few days," said he, "everybody
will know everything. Just now 1 dare
not talk."
It was inferred, however, that all the
Cabinet positions had not yet found cer
tain holders.

Martin Julian Prepares for the R -
ception of Lanky Bob, Who
Arrives To-Day.
CAKSON, Nev., Feb. 19.â Lanky Bob
Fitzsimrnons, the famous red-headed Cor
nishman who is to do battle with James
J. Corbett on St. Patrick's day for the
championship of the world, will arrive in
Carson to-morrow morning with his
family and reii-uie of trainers. This will
constitute tne last of the big events an
ticipated by the people here prior to the
great battle itse i f, and judging from the
talk and excitement on the streets to
nicht nearly the entire populace will turn
out to welcome the man who has pro
claimed that he will thump the pompa
dour champion into insensibility within a
few short and swoet rounds.
Martin Julian left, to-night for Reno in
order to meet his brother-in-law bright
and eariy anil escort him to Carson. In
cidentally Martin will take good pains to
impart to Bob all of the gossip he has
lieard during the few ilays he has been in
town, the bulk of it being in reference to
Corb=-tt's supposed physical condition.
Julian is pnzstod regarding Corbett.
While he has had no opportunity to get a
glimpse of Corbett stripped and at prac
tice, still he managed to slip a friend or
two into the opera-honse where Corbett
has been practicing daily with his trainers
and has received reports from them.
Julian is said now to entertain a sus
picion that the Californian has be j n play
ing 'possum. In other words, he has a
notion that Corbett and his friends have
been encouraging the spreading of rumors
to the effect that he was "not ritrht" in
the hope that Fitzsimmons might grow
careless in his own preparatory work,
while the truth of the matter is that he is
in better fix than he has been in years.
Julian is not the sort of chap to be easily
caught napping, and the chances are that
he will talk to his protege, Fitzsimmons,
like the proverbial Dutch uncle when it
comes down to discussing training items.
A private telegram was received liere
to-day which had a decided disturbing
effect upon the friends and admirers of
Fitzsimmons and caused Julian's face to
blanch. It was to the effect that the tall
Cornishman had seriously injured his
right arm near the elbow yesterday whi.e
taking exercise en route to the battlefield.
There were no particulars to be learned
iurther than this bare announcement and
nothine definite will probably be known
until he arrives here to tell the story with
his own lips.
Julian after he had recovered from his
first scare was disposed to treat the matter
rather lightly. "If it had been anything
seriou?," he said, "I would have received
a telegram beiore this." Fit&simmons*
manager is inclined to think that Bob'a
injury will be found to be a wrench or a
bruiae received while wrestling with
Ernest Roeber, one of his trainers. Roe
ber, he says, is a veritable giant in
strength, and when he and Fitz get hold
of each other their play is decidedly rough
and conducive to hard knocks and twisting.
Before his departure for Reno Manager
Julian took a sleigh ride out to Cook's
ranch, the place chosen for Fitmaimmons'
training-quarters, just to see if everything
was in apple-pie order for the pugilist's
reception. It is his intention to taKe Fit*
out to the ranch as soon after his arrival
as possible, rather than permit him to
loiter around many hours in town and
risk the chances of a brawl with Corbett2
or some of the latter's friends. It wouM
not take much to start Corbett and Fitz
at each other right In the street or
wherever they should chance to meet.
While returning from the ranch Julian
repeated his j>e;forrnance of yesterday by
being dumped out of his sleigh. He
landed on his bead in the middle of the
road, but the snow w;Â»s soft and spongy
and he escaped without injury. The
rotund little manager confessed after he
had been placed on his feet right side up
with care that he could not drive a sleigh
a little bit.
Jim Corbett gave a private athletic per
formance this afternoon before a select
party of Nevadans. The chief guest was
Governor Sadler, the man vho has be
come world famous because of his signing
of the now celebrated Garrard prize-right
ing bill, thus making possible the consum
mation of me great battle for the world's
championship. Along with the Governor
were a number of legislators and State
official?. They were delighted with the
exhibition and came out of the Opera
house convinced that Fitzs'mmons woulJ
have to prove himself more than a phe
nomenon to whip such a man.
CorDett snowed ihem how he worked
wi;h his trainers, sparring and wrestling
alternately with Biily Woods and Jack
McVey, and winding up with a red-not
bout with his brother Joe. Tbe latter is
rather too light for Jim, but he is a quick
and shifty boxer and hits extremely
hard. During this performance, which
lasted nearly an hour, Corbeit did not rest
a second. As soon as Woods would peg
out he would seize McVey'for clinch prac
tice, ana then after the big wrestler was
exhausted would resume sparring with
Woods.
"He's boxing faster and hitting harder
every day," remarked Woods a:ter one of
the bouts, as with i.is handkercuief he
mopped up the blood that was trickling
from nis nose. "I've j;ot good wind my
self, tut he pumps me out in no time. I'm
a veritable punching-tag for him, and he
doesn't spare me at all. But, just the
name, I stopped some of his very best
blows to-day.' 1
"How was that. Billy? I did not
notice," innocently asked Kid Egan.
"Why, with my face, of course," replied
the Denver cyclone, with an expansive
grin.
Woods could not resist cracking a joke,
even if Corbett had fractured his skull.
Corbett exercised twice to-day and ex
pressed himself as having gained consider
ably in strengtn and quickness &ince his
arrival in Carson. He says he 13 of the
opinion that he will thow to better ad
vantage in this climate and altitude than
in any location where ha ever trained or
fought be'ore. This is great news for his
friends and backers, as they have feared
all along that the rare atmosphere of
Carson would have a deteriorating effect
upon his system, and would seriously
interfere with his chances of getting into
the condition necessary to cope with such
a skilled and tough customer as Fitz-
BimmoDs.
It has been noticed that during Cor
bett's bouts with his trainers he does not
make so much nse of tha famous "side
ttep" wiin which he has tantehzad many
an antagonist. Iv the old days of his as
cendency in the Oiympic Club he em
ployed the aide step constantly and with
such skill and perfection that whoever
boxed with him was sure to be made to
Appear awkward and foolish.
"I have not abandoned the side step al
together," explained the champion to
day, 'â¢but experience has tau^M me that
too frequent resort vo it is dangerous, .t'ar
ticuiariy is this the case wbeo opposing a
man who uses the taciics of Fitzsimmons.
The latter seidom makes a straight lead,
but u^es the hook blow with either hand
instead. Now, nothing is more effective
in avoiding a straight lead than the Bide
step, and besides it gives one an opportu
nity to eeud a heavy bow into his oppo
nent's wind after the mis>; but when he
uses the hook mutters are quite different.
By side-stepping then you are apt to bump
your jaw square into your opponent's fi.-t.
1 don't propose to make any mistake of
that kind if I can help it."
Eddie Cooke, Corbett'a handsome press
agent, rushed breathlessly into the Ar
lington Hotel to-day, and seizing the
champion by the lapel dragged him off
into a corner.
"oay, Jim, I've gotgreat newa for you,"
he whispered between his gasps, "I just
learned that JTitzsimmons got a box on
his trahi, too."
"The deuce you say," said Corbett, his
countenance lighting up with a smile,
"now we are horse and horse."
The solution of this mysterious lingo
came afterward. Fighters, it appears, are
as superstitious as sailors. Nothing will
cause the hair of a pugilist to rise on
end quicker than to find that a corp-e is
being shipped on the same train that is
carrying him to a battlefield. It is a
"hoodoo" of the most malignant type and
the ring oracles say ti at no man can win
a right who has bad the ill luck to go
throueh such an experience. Now when
Corbett was being trundled hither from
Ean Francisco on the Atlantic Express he
was horrified by the discovery when ieav
ing Truckee that the express car contained
a "box." He had half a mind to turn
back and begin the journey over again.
Billy Woods wrung his hands in despair
and said it was "all off for sure," while
big Jack McVey Bat down and mumbled a
favorite devil-driving incantation.
But now comes the news that Fitzsim
rnons has been no more fortunate than
his opponent, for the train that is bring
ing him this way also carries a coffin.
Cooke's announcement of tnis fact was in
deed a morsel of relief for Corbett, and
explains the fervor wi< h which he declared
it was "horse and horse.' 1
But the" tidings brought no good lnck
with them for Cooke himself, for not ten
minutes after he released the lobe of the
Front View of the Carson Pavilion in Which th: Fight I; to Take Place.

of that body may be sent here to see how
the big mill is conducted, to as to be in a
position to make a report.

to the intended behavior of the pugilists
when in the ring. He impressed upon
both men the importance of furnishing
the public a clear., manly and square con

CARSON*, Nfv., Feb. 10.â Stuart has de
cided to make a live-bird shoot a feature
of the Carson carnival. To-day he stated
that he would add $1000 to a live-bird
handicap, and such men as Cavrer, Mc-
Allister, Budd, Parmeiee and marksmen
of that ilk will be seen in the contest.
Entries will close one day before the

SALT LAKE, Utah, Feb. 19.â 80b Fiiz

at the sanitarium, and visited several of

Fitzsimrnons says he weigh.* at present

He did not feel the altitude here to any
marked decree, and was disposed to poke
fun at Corbett, who, when here ten days
a o, was quite distressed by the rarity of
the atmosphere.
Referring to Corbett's sparring exhibi
tions Fitzsimnaons says Corbett instructs
his sparring partner (McVey) not to hit
him hard on the stage and gives a very
childish exhibition, and once when Me-
Vey let loose in a genuine hard hit Cor
bett threatened to discharge him.
Fitzsimmons talks very loud and affects
to believe that it will be an easy task for
him to knock Corbett out.
JOE VE>UIG MOZtjy OUT.
So He Will Sue Stuart for Some cf the
I.D-t Money
NEW YOKK, N. V., Feb. 19 âHowe &
Hurnmell. attorneys for Joe Vendig. tfie
well-known sporting man, were to-day in
structed to commence lesral proceedings
against Dan Stuart. It is alleged that
Stuart fa. led to keep an agreement which
was signed in June, 1895.
Stuart, Vendig says, promised to share
expenses, profits or losses of bringing Cor
bett ana Fitzsiramons together. The
counsel fees would be $1500 and the rent of
the arena would be $2,500. Vendig says
that he told Stuart to po ahead, but after
the latter reach sd Texas h<* wrote a letter,
saying that the cost would be much more.
In reply to this letter, Vendig says that be
wrote Stuart to po ahead and draw on him
whenever he needed money.
It is now a matter of history that the
bout was prohibited in Texas owing to the
action of ihe Legislature, and after a
fruitless tffort to bring it off in Arkansas
Stuart presented an Itemized bill to Ven
dig for expenses amounting to $20,522 and
an additional bill of $1390.
When Stuart and Vendig parted at
Little Rock, Ark., in the autumn of 1895
Vendig that Stuart promised to fol
low Fiiz^mmons to Australia and that he
told Stuart to go ahead, and that he would
be with him in anything that he should
do. A month later Wndiir received a
message from Stuart, who was then at
Houston, Tex., saying that he had offered
$â¢20,000 as a purse for Corbett ar*d Fitz
sim mons to fight anywhere.
This proposition, Ye.idig says, he noti-
tied Stuart that he was willing to abide
by. Stuart came on to New York in De
cember if that year with articles signed
by Fitzsimmons to fight Corbett, as well
as a verbal agreement to fight Maher.
When the artic.es were presented to Cor
bett he refused to s'uzn them, but said in
the presence of witnesses at the St. James
Hotel that he would fisrht the winner of
the Fitzsimmons-Maher battle.
Maher signed the articles for a $10,000
pur. c and Stuart left this city to get Fitz
simmons' signature. When Fitzsirnmons
signed Stuart wired Vendig that he had
to give Fitzsiramons $1000 fcr doing so.
The arrangements were all perfected for
the bout ai El Paso, but when it was
found Impossible to bring the fight oft at
that place Vendig says that Stuart and he
agreed to bring it off in Langtry.
Stuart said that they had a "goose egg"
before them, but they both agreed to bring
off the tiglit so as to show the public that
they meant business and that they would
easily recoup tl.eir losses by bringing Cor
bett and Fi:z3immous together later on.
One hundred and ten people paid to see
the fiiih t at Langtry and when S:uart end
Vendig compared notes they found that
they had lost $13 on the speculation.
This showed a total loss under the arti
cles of agreement of nearly $35,000, half of
which Vendig paid. Fnzsimmons made
a tour through Eiieland and on his return
he was met in this city by Stuart, and
with Vendig's consent Stuart traveled all
over Mexico to secure a ba t tie- ir round on
which the Corbett-Fhzsimmons contebt
could be pulled off.
Fitzsimmons and Corbett signed the
articles for the coming rh-ht and Stuart
went ahead to make arrangements. Ven
dig claims that Stuart failed to corre
spond with nim, and later on the Viti
scope Company was organized, with Ven
dig holding 15 per cent oi its capital.
W. H. Wheelock, who was Stuart's sec
retary, called on Vendig lor funds, and
Vendig says he advanced him $1336 in
accordance with arrangements which Ven
ui<r made with Stuart.
A few days aeo Venrtig received a teie
eraru from Stuart, dated Carson City,
which said that Stuart was willing to give
Vendig pooling interests on the event,
but nothing more. Vendig then felt that
he was being frozen out, and immediately
informed his lawyers.
GENERAL TREATY
WILL GO OVER
Evident That No Vote on
the Measure Will Be
Had This Session.
Fi ibustering Engaged In With
Od-Time V.gor by Op
ponents o* the Bill.
Senator Dani 1 M kes an Impassicn d
Address Impugning England's
Mo.iv s
WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. 19.â When
the Senate adjourned at 8 o'clock to-night,
after a secret session of seven and a half
hours, it was apparent to the most san
guine friends of the general treaty of arbi
tration with Great Britain that no vote
could be secured at this session of the
Senate. The fact that a motion to post
pone until March 5 had been defeated by
a vote of 34 to 20 afforded no satislaction.
On the contrary it emphasized the fact
that those fighting the treaty intended
there should be affirmative action of no
Kind. The debate proceeded in regular
order until 6 o'clock, when the Senators,
tired of the discussion anil weary in body,
left the chamber and proceeded to their
homes. For two hours longer there wa3 a
dreary succession Of aye and no calls and
calls of the Senate for the purpose of se
curing a quorum, which was no sooner
found to be present than it would disap
pear. Filibustering was indulged in with
the old-time vigor, and when, after two
hours of this sort of thing, the call of the
Senate failed to establish the presence of
a quorum a motion to adjourn prevailed
and the treaty was left hanging in the air.
At the close of yesterday's session Sher
man gave notice that heshouid to-day ask
the Senate to vote. The debate began as
soon as the doors were closed with consid
erable energy on the part of the friends of
the treaty; but they soon wearied of
their struggle with the inevitable. Lodge
and Frye spoke briefly but with a great
deal of spirit, urging that the vote be
taken this afternoon. Lodge aaid there
could be no doubt but that every Senator
had made up his mind how he should
vote, and any further delay would be a
waste of time and an exhibition of a de
sire to prevent action of any sort.
The speech of Senator Lodge was an ef
fort to "shell the bushes," and it was suc
cessful in driving into the open the ene
mies of the treaty. He was confronted
with a retort from Senators Teller anci
Stewart to the effect that no vote could ba
had. Teller then took the floor and spoke
for an hour against the treaty and against
present action. Â»
Immediately upon the closing of the
doors of the Senate the treaty was taken
up for consideration, and Nelson of Min
nesota made another speech urging that
action be postponed until the Senate con
vened on March 5 next. He called att< n
tion to the press 01 business on tiie senate
calendar, and dwelt espec ally upon the
need fur the passage oi some iorm of
bankruptcy act.
Piatt of Connecticut again antagonized
postponement, believing that the be~t in
terests of the country demanded immedi
ate action. Mr. Frye of Maine, who, as
s ated yesterday, wss inclined to think
postponement would be the proper course,
came out this morning in & short but spir
ited speech advocating action by the Sen
ate to-day. Senator Siewart of Nevada
strongly urged postponement aud was fol
lowed by Senator Teller of Colorado in the
same vein. Teller, as a member of the
Committee on Appropriations, told his
colleagues that tne Senate would have ail
it could <lo to pass remaining bilis between
now and March 4.
The demand for an immediate vote was
made almost &s soon as the doora were
closed by Senators Lodge and Frye, each
of whom spoke for hve minutes. Teller
retorted promptly that no vote on the
treaty itself should be taken, and the de
bate then begun indicates the intention of
the opponents to wear out the Senate un
til, by sueer exhaustion, it is willing to
vote to postpone. The merits of the treaty
can be discussed in lv.l on the motion to
postpone, and this was done.
In the course of his argument Mr. Teller
said that he was not prepared to say that
he should not vote for the treaty. He
favored the principle of arbitration, but
the treaty bad been bungled and bally
drawn End he believed there should be
auiDle time for consideration.
Tne more the treaty was discussed the
more became the objections that, had been
made to it
The fcenate, Teller said, ought not to be
cailed upon to vote upon bo important a
question at thia late day in the session.
The State Department had baen four years
in framing a treaiy which it believp 1 to be
now Derfeci, but which the majority of
the Senate knew did not protect the in
terests of the American people. If the
State Department with its men skilled in
diplomatic procedure had b^en four years
preparing a treaty why, Teller asked,
would the administration and thecountry
be so insistent that the Senate should deal
tinally with the subject in a few weeks?
Daniel of Virginia addressed the Senate
for upward of two hours, and made a
powerful impression. He was against the
treaty, and advanced some of the .--trong
eÂ«Â«t arguments that have yet been hearJ.
War was not a bad thin:.. Daiiiel said,
when the nation that went to war had the
richton its side and was upholding the
honor and integrity of its people. The
United Stales was the only country that
Great Britain feared, and if she coulil put
us under bonds to keep the peace Great
Britain would go ahead with her policy of
aggression and aggrandizement and laugh
at any pro est that we might make or
defy any position we might assume
against her oppression of the peoples of
the Western Tlemisphere. The American
people were a people of peace; the policy
of the country for*r2o years nad been one
of peace.
It had arbitrated its differences time
and again and was pledged to that prin
ciple, but when it went into a solemn
compact for that purpose with Great
Britain there siionld be an equality of
terms. The United States had everything
to los* by tne treaty and G cat Britain
everything to gain. The Congress of the
United Stairs 1 ad never der'arvd war un

less such war was jurtifiable; the United
States had never acquired any territory by
war unless as the result of a war that wag
ofdeenseor necessary for the perpetua
tion of the Republic.
"I love the blood o! the Revolntion/'v
said Mr. Dar.iei in one of his impassioned |
utterances. "It in full of al that is great '
and noble in the history of this country."
Mr. Daniel then proceeded to show that
the lessons of the Revolution oueht not to
be forgotten, and that tte people of the
United States should be wary of any over
tures made to them by her traditional
enemyâ Great Britainâ spaaking ti ough
they do the same language. Of all the
power*, England was the one which the
Uuited States should refuse to blindly
follow.
It would be a sorry day for this Nation
when its hnnds were tied by an acreement
that gave Great Britain all she asknd and
'compelled us to Keep quiet in th* face of
the policy that that Nation will continue
to follow, regardless of any solemn pledge
she may give.
During the course of an analytic criti
cism of the treaty Mr. Daniel said the
members of the Supreme Court ought not
to be designated as rap tubers of the arr>i.
tration tribunal. He iavored the inser
tion of an amendment that leit the mem
bership of that court to the President by
and with the advice and consent of the
Senate.
Hoar suggested that the members of the
Supreme Court had already been con
firmed by the Senate and each member of
that body was well known to the Seriate.
"That may be true," replied Daniel.
"We Know the members of that court an-l
we know them all to.be honorable men,
but this treaty is for the future. We do
not know who may be the members of
this tribunal in the future. All our Fre i
dents have been good men and have ap
pointed good men, but we do not know
that all our coming Presidents will be
zood men, as they will not be actuated by
the same motives that have aciuated
thoa" who have gone before."
The last speech of the day was made by
Senator Linds;iy of Kentucky, who urged
the ratification of the convention and-,
action to-duy. He spoke for almost an\
hour, devoting the most of his time to a
refu ation of the legal arguments au- '
vanced by Senator Daniel and others who
have during this debate taken the ground
that the Senate was asked to yield up its
prerogatives as a part of the treaty
making power.
At the end of his speech Lindsay made
a motion to postpone the consideration of
the treaty. Motions to aOjourn were in
variably voted down or developed the
absence of v quorum. Sherman pleaded
in vain for an asreeraent for a day and
hour upon which tuevote might be taken.
Every suggestion of his was objected to
and one roilcull succeeded anotuer, and
finally it was impossible to secure a
quorum. A motion waa then made and
carried instructing tiie sergeant-at-arms
to arrest absent Senators and bring them
before the bar of the Senate. While the
ser?eant-at-arms was preparing his war
rants the friends of tne treaty held a con
sultation, which resulted in a motion to
adjourn by Gallinger. This prevailed,
and. without any notice dP the part of
Shsrman that he would again call up the
treaty, the Senate at 8 o'clock adjourned.
It is not improbable, however, that
Sherman may make one more effort to
secure a vote.

Rheumatism Cured.
Sax Francisco, Cal., Feb. 13, 1897.
Stale Electro Medical Instituteâ Dear Doctors.
When I commenced your Kleciri -Medical treat-
ment I was an Invalid from rheunia:lsm. About
eight years ago I was attacked with inflammatory
rheumatism, which after a time changed to sciat-
ica, A number of the be.i physicians of baa
Francisco treated me and pronounced my case in-
curable. Nothing gave me permanent relief until
1 tried your Â£lectro-medical treatment. I had
tried electricity alone, and as for inking medicines
alone, I had exhausted the catalogue or medicines.
Your giving of medicines in conjunction with elec-
tricityâthe coin Dined treatment is what cured me.

Its Investigation of

Opera f ion of the Contract of the
National Wall Paper
C mpany.
Manner in Which the United States
Rubber Compary's Stock Was
D:stributed
NEW YORK, N. V.. Feb. 19.-The
joint legislative comnntiee appointed to
investigate the existence oi trusts and
monopolies it. New York resumed its ses
sions this niornirp. It was 10 :30 o'clock
when Senator Lexow rapped for ordei.
Henry Burn, president of the National
Wall-paper Company, \v!io was on the
stand when the session adjourned yester
day, wa." recalled.
Mr. Burn produced a copy of the con
tract made with agents, or the "factors
agreement," as Senator Lexow termed it.
One of the clauses requires agents to han
dJe only the goods o: ihe National Wall
paper Company. In reply to a question
the witness said that his company had an
agreement with the labor unions by which
the employes worked eleven months of
ihe year.
"DoeÂ« the agreement l.old through the
Unued States?"
"Ye=. sir; in every one of our factories."
Mr. Barn said tha'. when the company
was organized it comprised twenty-four
sub-companies and sernn competing fac
tories were left out. Ten factories were
closed within two years after the consoli
dation. This, the witness admitted.
caused a decrease of 10 per cent in the
labor employed. The factories were closed
because they were making inferior goods.
He :-aid that tue rate of wages was not de
creased after consolidation except to mate
them uniform. The company had abso
â¢ ceded everything required by the
!abi>r union. The witnesses said they em
ployed 25 per cent more salesmen and
more bookkeepers than before consolida
tion; that prices to the consumer had de
creased.
Chairman Lexow here announced that
he w( \!.i now ;ake up the United States
Rubber Company's affair.--. The other
witi r-*es in the wall-paper business were
t.-ri until thi> afternoon.
lea EL Flint was nueationed about
the distribution ot the stock of the United
.vates Rubber Company to the various
companies.
"I want to state," he said, "that the
United States Rubber Company lias, as a
corporation, no knowledge rÂ«j the distribu
tion of stuck by the bankers. I know,
however, that tne stock was distributed
on ttie basis of preferred s:ock for tangible
assets and ccnimon stock fur trademarks,
patents." etc.
Mr. Fiint handed in the original Sim
mons report on wljic < tlic distribution of
stock was m ~de, bm the schedule of values
a*ked Sordid not accompany it. In reply
to a question, he confessed thai he had not
tne information whicc would explain the
increase in the price of rubber shoes since
tbe consolidation. Mr. F.int denied tbat
the United State* Rubber Company had
become tbe football of speculators.
He said it would re^uiate prices of goods
as they did prices o! railroad;, because
conditions varied so much. He aid not
t;:ink it would be a wise move lor the
State to buy Dp all industrials and run a
paternal form of government, and he saw
no other way by which the State could
reculatepr ices.
The promoting contracts showed that
$40. 000 had been paid for promoting the
rubber combination, of which Mr. Flint
.^d $2du.000, the banking company
$100,000 and Mr. Earl $100,000. Mr. Flint
.-aid the object of the combination was to
promote the natural law of trade. He
then entered into a long disccurse as to
the object of centralization of the indus
tries.
The afternoon session was held in a city
courtroom, the Aldermanic chamber,
wnere the committee had held its previ
ous sessions, beinp required for a meeting
of the Board or Aldermen.
Mr. Flint took the stand, ile said that
the prices to-day were lower than for nine
year 1 * previous to 'he organization of tne
United States Rubber Company. He also
stated that the price list was iower now
than ever beiore.
"How ca:i the prices be lower when the
prices you give arc higher?"
"Because the discount to jobbers was
higher before the organization of the com
pany."
Ihe explanation of the witness caused a
laugh.
"1 Hat means, does it not, tha: ther^ was
a preater profit to your organization ?''
Mr. Flint dissented. He declined to
admit that there was any agreement be
tween the United States Rubber Company
and the bankers previous to September 6
1892.
An adjournment was taken until to
morrow.

PASADENA HOTEL PROJECT.
Prcminent Cit,zens Think of Establishing
v Resor: Superior to Any in
Southern California.
LOS ANGELES, Cau, Feb. 19.â The
project of building a tine tourist hotel is
being quietly canvassed among prominent
citizens of Fasadena. Strong assurances
of financial support have already been
given, and it is oelieved by those who have
actively interested themselves in the en
terprise that there will be no difficulty In
securing sullicient capital. The plan con
tempiates a hotel that shall bo superior to
any in Southern California.
Necessarily, the rates will be high; but
every season brings an increasing number
of wealthy tourists, who demand accom
modations superior to anything that is
now afforded. A hne hotel, equipped
with ah the luxuries that this class of
visitors expect and situated in an at
tractive part of lovely Pasadena, with
handsome grounds and s-urroundings,
wouid give the city an enviable reputa
tion throughout the East. It would,
moreover, be more than a mere stoppini:
pluce en route to other resorts. Visitors
would come for the season, as they -.'o to
the Fiagler hotels at St. Augustine, Fla.
The one wh.ch seems to meet with the
greatest favor is Mrs. (rreen's place, Car
melita. Processor Lowe's place on fcouth
Orange Grove avenue has also been sug
gested, but ii is thought to be too remote
from the heart of the city. There can be
no question tdai Pasadena needs greater
hotel accommodations. ThÂ» Green is
already well tilled and mo3t of the smaller
hotels have little or no room to suare.
Every day brings newcomers from the
Ea-t, and many of them have gone on to
Coronado because unable to find suitable
accommodations in the "crown of the
vniiey."

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1897.
CLOSE CALL FOR
THE COMMISSION
Lively Discussion in the
Assembly Over Cutter's
Resolution.
Confidence in the Present Rail
road-Rate Fixers Is
Expressed.
So the Attempt to Abo'ish the State
80-rd Is Defeated by a
C ose Vote.
SACRAMENTO, Cal, Feb. 19.â There
was a lively discussion in the Assembly
to-day oÂ»er Assembly concurrent resolu
tion 23, introduced by Cutter of Yuba, to
abolish the R; ilroad Commission. When
il was reached on the tile Toland made a
vigorous speech against it. He knew, he
said, that the commission had been
charged with nevr-r hav:nc accomplished
anything in the line of their duty for the
benefit of the people, and there was prob
ably much truth in the charge, but the
people this time Dad Commissioners who
ara standing by the interests of the peo
ple, and he believed that in the future it
would be possible to get officers who m:iy
do as well. They had met with threat dii
ncuity in enforcing their action on ac
count of the action of the courts. While
the commission had not been altogether a
success, the gentlemen who upheld the
resolution had suggested nothing better.
The obstacles which stood in the way of
the people controlling the railroads had
been met one by one ana gradually over
come, and it was but a matter of time
wh<Â»n the solution of the problem wili be
obtained.
Cutter congratulated the gentleman
from Ventura on the fact that his bump
of hopa was as large as It was. For seven
'een years that commission had existed,
and ell the beneiit derived from it by the
State had been in the payment o! $500,000
for the support of the commission. Now
they piopose to come :nto this Legislature
with a bill lor ?00,030, for a starter. Ex
perience had shown that the commiss'on
was ornamental, not useful. The resolu
tion proposed to give to the people an op
portunity to say whether that commission
should be continued or not.
"I had supposed from his speech of yes
terday," added Mr. Cutter, "that the gen
tleman was in fayor of the referendum,
but it seems that to-day he is not. 1
woulJ not submit to the people an amend
ment that I knew they would vote down
by a lari:e majority, but ii is my auty to
al.ow the people to vote for such an or
ganic law as they wish. 1 think that tLe
people do desire to abolish this commis
sion."
Bridgford (Fusioniit) said that tde reso
lution was a general proposition to take
away all restraint from the railroad com
nany. That wouid be the result if the
proposition were submitted to the people
anil carried. Past experience had taught
that it was absolutely necessary that there
should be some governing tody; some
po<ver that controlled. The State had at
temp:ed to control the railroad company
by a commission, and it was true that they
had noi been as successlul as had been
hoped. He could show where tne com
mission had done some Rood, and that
was when the freight on wheat from
Colusa by way ot Knights Landing, re
shipped on boats to Vallejo, was $1 .50, and
at the same time the freight :roiu Wood
land to Vallejo. a much shorter distance,
wa- $3.
The commission regulated tbat condi
tion of things, and the town of Woodland
had profited largely by that action of the
Railroad Commissioners.
"Will the gentleman tell me." asked
Cutter, "how it is that if the Railroad
Commission < ffected such a saving there
they didn't effect a hk- one in the valley
of tne San Joaquir. ? Was it not some
thing outside ol the commission that had
helped the San Joaquin Valley?"
Bridgford replied that nothing could be
regulated completely by law. Tnere were
laws against murder and theft, but mur
der and thelt went on.
Caminetti, who afterward silently stole
away from the rollcall, remarked that the
commission was not responsible for the
decision of the courts. Oi late years the
people nad been bordering upon a Gov
ernment made oy decisions of the United
Stati-s courts. "We have entered into a
Government by injunction," he ndde:.
'â¢and that was me trouble that could not
be remedied under the constitution.
The powers given ;o tne Railroad Com
mis.Â«ion were ample to meet the i-sue, but
in past years the majority of that power
has never been willing until to-day to do
their duty, which the people expected
them to do. Now that we have a power
willine to carry out the wishes of the
ppople, we find that power enjoined by
the courts of the United States. Let us
arm the commission with all tlieauthority
that we have a right to confer upon
them. Then, and not until we have
tried such legislation, will it be time to
consider the que>tion of abo.ishiog the
commission or not."
CutU-r came to the front again. "The
cent eman has no evidence, he said,
'â¢that the people don't wÂ»nt the curo
mi-!-i"ii, and now he refuses to allow the
Deopie to say whether they want them or
not. He is in the same position he was in
the State Printing Office matter."
"There tias been no petition," said
Camii:etti.
Dennery failed to find a solitary argu
ment against submitting the queetion"u.
the people. If they were to make their
argument before the people, there might
be some justice in the statement. "If %ye
pass tuis amendment, it will not abolish
the commission. As the peop.e have
created this commission, they should be
allowed to say whether it should be per
petuated or not."
Belshaw of Contra Costa said that it
seemed 10 him from the argument that
the people are in favor of atolisbitiL- the
commission, an. l that the gentlemen en
the other side are afraid to submit it tj
the people, for fear that n.ey would abol
ish it. The decision of Juuge McKenna
was that they were an illegal body and
had no power. If that was so the com
mission should be abolished.
Shanaban said that in times past he had
votfd to abolish the cummiysion, because
he bslievea that there was no hope to b<;
looked tor from that direction. It had
co~t the peop.e $350 000. That was a heavy
tux ana if no quod could como out of it it
uu.ht to be a olished. 'Now that we
have a commisoon that is doins its duty
to the people it is no time to abolish it."
So far h> .Judge McKenna'a decision was
concerned it h ><>uld be remembered that
the Commiss.u.i -ra appealed to the Su
preme Court of tue United States.
Dibble said that up to this time he had
always voted against the abolition of the
Railroad Commission and he propose d to
continue to do so. He beiiev-d that the
management of railroad freights, and fares
coultj not be saf ]y trusted to the Legisla
ture in a sixty days' session. It was a
matter that should receive the most care
ful consideration. The commission had
worked well since the adoption of the new
constitution up to the present time. If
an amendment was to be suq.e^ted it
auould be to elect the Railroad Commis
sionera at larce throughout the State in
stead of by districts as now.
Valentine of Los Angeles said that he
was in favor of the amendment for the
simple reason that he did not believe it
was now or had ever been of any prac
tical utility in this State. For the seven
teen years during which period the people
had been imjulgine in the luxury ot a
commission which had not accomplished
anything they had not undertaken to re
duce the rates of freights and fares in the
San Joi.(jui!i Valley.
"There have been hundreds of thousands
of instances," continued Valentine,
"where if they desired to carry out the
purposes for which they wore created
they would be of vast benefit to this State,
but they didn't do it and they would not
have attempted to do what they did had
it not been because of the existence of a
rival railroad company â the Valley road.
The opponents of the resolutions cannot
show a single instance in which the Rail
road Commissioners have been successful
in granting relief to the people."
Melick of Los Angeles while not in
favor of abolishing the commission was in
favor of submitting the amendment to the
people. The commission was created
when sandlot oratory was ablaze in the
land.
Dryden made a long talk in favor of re
taining the c 'inmission.
"The P.ipulist- show their utter incon
sistency by s; caking against the principal
plank in t c plat.orm oi their party â ihe
referendum," said Cutter.
Jiurniiam said he would vote to submit
the resolution to the people.
"Ii you can show any evidence," said
Cross, "that the railroad company has
ever been controlled by this useless, blood
sucking Railroad Commission I should
liie to see it. The people in my part of
the Siate are heartily sick of it."
The resolution was deieated by the fol

BACRAMENTO. Cal.. Feb. 19.â While
the Assembly strained itself almost to the
point of disruption over a matter of $4000
in connection with the pay of temporary
attaches, it swa. lowed without an appa
rent effort a bill improperly appropriating
JUO.OOO for tlie insane asylum at Sail Ber
nardino, known ;Â»3 Assembly bill 108.
Assemblyman Goff was the father of the
measure whicn hears t tie titie, "An act
making an appropriation to pay lor the
support of the Southern Ca.iforma State
Asylum for the Insane and Inebriates for
the remainder of the forty-eighth fiscal
year.' This fiscal year ends June 30,
1837.
Nothing amiss was noticed in relation
to the bill until it had passed the Assem
bly, was sent to the Senate and there re
ferred to the Committee on Finance. Here
attention was attracted to the fact that the
$2'j.oQo asked for was a deficiency, and
tnat it had not been submitted to the
Board of Examiners and approved by that
body, as required by law. The result is
that the Senate Finance Committee has
decided to "hang up" the bill, which
means that it will not again Bee daylight
in its present shape.
Assemblyman Goff claims that the ap
propriation is not for a deficiency as con
templbted by law, as the institution on
whose behalf it is asked still has funds on
hand, but not enough to carry it to the
end of the present fiscal year.
The situation is tue same, in fact, that
confronted the State Printing Office when
he bill appropriating $75,000 for that
establishment threw its tir*t disturbing
rays into the Assembly chamber. Goif,
however, claims tnat the law governing
the State Printing Office and other State
institutions is not the same. '
As the matter now stands his opinion is
at variance with that of the Finance Com
mittee, with the legislative machinery
under control of the lattei. Interesting
developments may follow, in the course of
which the management of the San Ber
nardino Asylum may be called upon to
explain the cause of this great deficiency.
MRS. STANFORD'S
WAY MADE EASIER
Now the Noble Woman Can
Leave Her Estate to
the University.
Legal Obstructions to the Course
Proposed Removed by the
Legislature.
Passage of the First of the Three Bills
in the laterests of the Palo
Alto Institution
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 19.âStan
ford University held the floor of the Sen
ate this morning. The programme of the
friends of the university was to secure the
passage of three bills in the interest of
that institution. One of these was to
clear the way of legal obstructions, so
that Mrs. Jane Stanford can leave the ]
whole of her estate to the university J
bearing the title of her deceased son. The
second was to exempt the $20,000,000 en
dowment to the institution from taxation
and the third wa^ to apportion the loss
thus sustained to the State and to tue
counties in wbicn the property included
in tue endowment is located among all
the counties of the State. Presiaent
David Starr Jordan has been here for
several days in the interest of these
measures.
The first of these measures passed with
little opposi ion, the second went over as
unfinished business until Tuesday after
an interesting and somewhat heated de
bate, while the third was not reached on
the file.
Voorheis' Senate bill 273 brought the
matter on the boards. Tins provides for
amending the Civil Code relative to re
strictions on the power of devisa to char
itabie uses. Under the existing law only
a third of an estate can be bequeathed to
this use. The amendment provides that
devises to educational institutions in this
State in which tuition is free and equally
open to all and without sectarian bias or
control shall oe excepted from the opera
tion of the existing law. provided there is
no surviving husband or wife or lineal
dc-cendants of the testator.
The object of the measure is to permit
Mr?. Jane Stanford, who has no lineal de
scendants, to bequeath all of her property
to the Staniord University, which, it was
explained by Senator Voorheis, she pur
poses doing. The bill passed, with but
little debate, by a vote oi 32 ayes to 4
nors.
Next in order on the third reading file
was another measure fathered by Voor
heis, known as Senate bill 274, and entitled
"An act to establish a3 public schools
technical schools endowed by pi vate gif i,
comir.fr within certain requirements, and
to encourage sucii en :owments." The
object of the bill, Senator Voorheis ex
plained, was to exempt the Stanford
University from taxation, nn<J thus save
to that instituiiou the sum of $30,000 a
year, which might be applied to educa
tional purposes.
Braunhart made an indirect attack on
the measure by moving to strifee out the
words 'without sectarian bias or coniroi."
The iesu:t <>f the adoption of toe amend
ment wou.d have b;en the exemption of
ail sectarian institutions in which tuition
is free, from taxation.
Morehouse made a forcible argument
against the adoption oi the amendment.
He pointed out that Stanford University
stood a^one ol" its kind in the State; that
its benefits accrued to the wnole people of
the State; that it was a public institution
in all respects, except that it was osten
s-ibiy under the control of a genoroua
rninded and public-spirited woman, the
widow of a man who had set asid
s2o 000,000 for the creation and main
tenance of a great educational institution
for the ben fit of the youth of California.
He thought it was a small thing to ask of
the State exemption from the payment of
$30,000 a year, which sum wouid be ap
piied to tlie education of the 1500 students
now attending ttiat university. He added
that the State was contributing nothing
to the in-tituiion. It was only a question
of time, he concluded, wheu the entire
property of the university as well as that
of slrs. Stanford would tall to the State.
For these reasons he saw no reason for
any opposition to the bill or for the adop
tion of ttie amendment. The amendment
was defeated.
Gil ette attacked the bill on the ground
that it wa.3 unconstitutional. He quot d
from t he coJe to show that public schools
were those that were supported by the
State by means of taxai.on. and that "must
be under State control. H.s opposition
was also due to tbe lact that the Vina
ranch, part of thÂ« Stanford University
endowment, was located in Teliama
County, and that this b.ll would deprive
the county of $12,000 each year now col
lected as taxes ou ihis property. He was
aware, he salt!, that it was proposed to
apportion this los.-. among all the counties
of the State, but he did not think it fair
to make other roumies contribute to the
loss any one county mi^ht sustain by the
withdrawal of taxable property through
the bill undpr discussion.
Jones opposed the measure for the
reason, he stated, tliat it would impose
additional taxation on all the counties ot
the State to the extent of the amount
ttiat would be lost by exempting the Stan
ford University.
During tue afternoon session the further
consideration of the subject was deferred,
as WTcral of the Senators who desired to
participate in ttie debate and to vote i n
the bills would not be present again
until Tuesday.
Senator Dwyer. who voted in favor of
Senate bill _70, nave notice of recons dera
tion on tlie suggestion oi Senator Wolfe,
who was absent when the vote on n was
taken and who desires to speak against
the measure on sectarian grounds.
This bili, iike the one remaining as un
finished business, applies only to institu
tions "without sectarian bias or control,"
and Wolfe proposes to move to strike out
the clause of limitation so as to bring sec
tarian schools under tho operation of t:ie
proposed law. Wolir's attitude may lead
to some exciting debate on religious lines.
Among those who have already an
nounced their intention to participate in
the debate are Senators Morebouse, Simp
son, Smith and Stratton, all able (speak
ers and good lighters.
JOBXSTOX'S STATEMEXT.
7ht State, l'rinter t- jrplninn thÂ« Condi'
tlon of Hi* Vfflcc.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 19.â 1n ac
cordance with the programme agreed
upon yesterday at the conference between
the Governor and the State Printer, the
latter sent the following communication
to the State Bonrd of Examiners to-day:
Sacramento, Feb. 19, 1887.
Jo the Honorcb'.e Shite Hoard of - Examiners â
Gentlemen: I desire to present for your con-
Mtteiatiou ihe following fact-: On July 1,
1890, there was available ia the State Treasury
lor the support and maintenance of the State
Printing Office ior ihe fiscal year, beginning
July 1, 1896, and ending June 30, 1897, the
total sum of $103,999 41.;
The Legislature of the Slate of California
met in Sacramento on the 4ih day of January,
1897. Prior to that time for work that had
been ordered through the tegular channel*,
j your honorable body allowed claims ageregat
>ng $91,231 *:;. ihat left iv the fun". avaU
r.b c lor the support of the printing om<-- for
;he balance 61 the year the sum of 512.767 58.
lv this connection it ought to be stated that
the sum of ab.iut $1000 was expended on
Claims allowed by your houorsb.o body in
preparation far the Legislator*). Since the
LeglsUtnn convened the State Printing Office
has printed bilis thht have been ictro-luceti,
as provided by the constitution and other
won as ordered by the Legislature and State
officers, the lotal amount oi claims for which
is ihosum of about $35,000.
Your honorable body lias allowed, since the
benr'.'-inc: of this year, claims aggregating
$11,525 40, which 'eaves in the treiiMiry for
-he use of .lie State Printing Office the Mim'of
$1242 18. It is difficult, if not impossible to
e.-uiaaie the am. mm that will b.; required to
be extended for the necessary uses of the
Legislature, but I will say; ho we've r. for your
information, that tho amount expended for
this purpusp. two year* ano was the sum of
$78,000, itiul 1 presume it will be fair to esti
mate mat a like amount will be necessary this
year. It will be equally aifficuit, if not im
possible, to estimate the amount of money
that will be required to supply \h: demands
of tne S ate institutions and officers lor the re
mainder of this fifcftl venr. If i could now tell
In advance what the<e items would be I could
make ru approximately nccuraie estimate.
It would be fair to estimate under i.ormal
circumstances, that the demands upon this
office for this purn>se for the balance ot the
year would be $15,000, but it will probably be
greater than this Â»urn, because all the aepiart
ments and institutions are refran.iu,: l rom
sending me their orders, knowing tbat I am
unab.e to till them, not only from lack of
funds, but ii .so the demands made upon me by
the Legislature are sogroat that I can attend
to nothing else, and it will be fair to estimate,
therefore, that the demands will approximate
$15,000.
In orrtT 10 carry on the work required by
the Legislature it will be nec-ssary to have an
additional appropriation of $75,000, and in
order to run the State Printing Office so as to
do the work required by tne other depart
menis of tne Government until the first day of
July, 1897.
At '.he beginning of the session of this Legis
lature there was no deficiency, and the Legis-
I latm-e undertook to pr vide additional appro
priaiiong, which, for reasons known to you,
have not become laws.
There are now pending in the Legislature
two bills, known respectively as Assembly bills
863 and 864, making appropriations of money
for the purposes de-cribcd.
1 respect uliy place these matters before
your houorable body, Jask you to cive them

SAN DIEGO'S BIG
WATER CARNIVAL
Everything Ready for the
Grand Opening This
Afternoon.
Crowds of Visitors Continue to
Arrive by Train From
All Directions,
Storm Ceases, Barometer Rises and
the Success of the Celebration
Is Assured.
SAN DIEGO, Cal.. Feb. 19.â Tc-ninht,
the eve of the carnival, finds everything
in readiness for the big celebration which
will begin to-morrow afternoon at 1:55
o'clock and continue at full speed, with the
throttle wide open, until the last rocket is
fired and the electric light is turned out
on the bay of San D:ego Monday night.
The weather to-nijifct is squally and
threatening, and an unsteady barometer
rising and falling portends a continuation
of present conditions. Some three-quar
ters of an inch of rain has fallen to-day
and many of the. streets are nearly im
passable. The fear among the members
of the Reneral committee is not that the
carnival itself will not be a 9ucceÂ«>s, but
that some of the visitors who contemplated
coming to-morrow from Los Angeles and
other cities may be deterred from starting
on account of the threatened storm. If
the high wind continues the boats will
not be able to race on the bay to-morrow,
but there is no doubt but that the weather
for Sunday and Monday wiil be perfect, as
usual.
The carnival will be formally opened at
1 :55 o'clock to-morrow afternoon with the
firing o! a signal-gun from the prow of
the flagship Philadelphia, which will
also be the preparatory signal for the
aquatic sports. At 2 o'clock the boats in
the yacht regatta will start, all four classes
getting away together. In the regatta
will be thirty boats â sloops, schooners,
catboats, sharpie?, yawls and fishing
boatsâand the course will be six miles in
lengthâ from tbe Pacific Coast Steamship
wharf to Twenty-eighth street aud return.
Following this will be a series of races be
tween the crews of the warship boats, in
cluding races between 12-oar cutters, G-oar
gigs, luoar cutter 3 and free-for-all cata
marans.
The day will conclude with a grand
naval and military ball in the spacious
ballroom of the Coronado Hotel, which
has been decorated as never before for the
occasion.
Literally hundreds of fia:s of all na
tions, bancer? and pennants of every de
sign and color, have been suspended from
the splendid vaulted dome, and the logos
of the guests of honor arc draped aud fes
tooned witn battle- flags aud naval pen
nants, crowned with splendid baskets of
roses and wild flowers, the brilliant poppy
and delicate yellow violet contrasting viv
idly with the trailing srniiax and dark
green English ivy. In tne most gorgeously
decorated Joge in the ballroom will be Ai
miral Beardalee, the guest of the carnival,
with a few invited guests. It is a matter
of eeneral regret that illness will prevent
Mrs. Beardslee from participating in the
festivities given in the admiral's honor,
although her many friends are glad to
know she is convalescing.
At the ball to-morrow night the splen
did military band of the flagship I'htla
dejphia will furnish the music, and the
brilliant uniforms of the officers mingling
with the beautiful costumes of the fair
guests will make the occasion a notable
one in the social history of the bay region.
The crowds of visitors which are arriving
by every train make it plain that San
Diego will be called upon to entertain the
largest crowd in her history if it does not
rain to-morrow. The two Santa Fe trains
arriving to-day brought 1000 passengers
and the steamer Queen to-night discharged
over 200, mostly from Los Angeies. All
the suburban trains to-day have been
crowded and several times as many are
expected to-morrow.
By a fortuitous arrangement made by
Manager Fisher John P. Sousa's great
military band has been engaged to appear
twice at the opera-house on Sunday. The
music for the carnival will be furnished by
the City Guard band, two smaller bands
and a chorus of 100 trained voices, who
will cin g from" the barge Tortuga dnriug
the parade of the flotilla Monday night.
Chairman Isaac Poihamus of the god
dess committee announced to-night that
the goddess' barge was complete and ready
for occupancy by iti fair ruler, the god
dess of the carnival, Mrs. Lewi3 Reed
Works, who with her retinue of thiriy
four men and maidens, eleeantly appar
eled, will take possession of the floating
palace at 7:45 o'clock on Monday night.
The barge is a most beautiful and artistic
creation, 120 feet in length and 35 feet
beam.
The main deck has been carpeted for
dancing, and suspended from an arch
which extends from bow to stem of the
barge will be 200 colored incandescent
electric lights with as many more hung in
festoons about in such a manner as to
bring out the best effect. The barge 13
gorgeously decorated in buntineand flags,
with splendid floral designs abounding
everywhere.
Everybody is happy to-night, for the
sky is clear, the stars are gaining and the
rapidly rising barometer indicates that
the storm is over and Queen Climate has
again resumed the reins in the San Diego
bay region. This insures the success of
the water carnival.
A pleasant feature of the present cele
bration is that sufficient funds are now in
the hands of the committee to pay all bills
incidental to the carnival, about $ > 2000.
ROWLAND HART'S STORY.
The Youthful Desperado Accused of Horse-
Stealing Tells of His Battle With
Two Constables.
SALINAS, Cal., f eb. 19.â Young Row
land Hart, the 16-year-old desperado, as
he sat in his cell in the County Jail to-day
told how he shot a man and then escaped
a shower of bullets. Hart was caught near
Cholame by Constables Stoker and Ward,
and after being examined by Justice Wat
kins at Cholame and committed to jail,
he toid the following story:
"My name is Rowland Hart and I am
16 years old. For some time past I have
been working in the mines out from
Bakersfield, but was recently discharged,
whereupon I decided to come to San Luis
and wort up the coast to Santa Cruz,
where I used to live. I tr&ded with a fel
low at Bakersfield for a horse. 1 took the
horse and started for this town, coming
over to Carrissa and down over the moun
tains till I got to Tillman Fowler's ranch,
where I asked if I could stay all night,
and was told that I could. Two fellows,
one named Woodruff and the other name i
Logan Hunter, came up and looked at my
horse and asked me if it was not a com
pany bone. I did not know anything
///SS flabtllt cfmitk -
Jlr.s John Ft eld-
about company bosses and told them that
I got the animal at BakersrieU. They
then told me they were going to tatce me
back to Bak-rstield. I asked them what
for, but they did not say anything more
than that I had stolen a horse from tlie
company. They did not seem to have
any authority and did not show any war
rants, and as I i.ai not stolen the norse I
made up my mind not to go. They made
me go into Fowler's house anil sleep with
Lagan Hunter, who kept a pistol by him.
"In the morning I got up arid dressed.
1 took a ntle whicn was in the room and
ran out on the porch. The men followed.
Logan Hunter had his hands in his pock
ets and I thought he was coins; to pail a
gun. I bad my rifle up. Woodruff made
a rush at me and grabbed the gun and it
went off, giving him a flesh wound in the
left breast. He did not fall, but ran
around tue house. Hunter began run
ning backward and firing at me. I shot
a-, him three times, one ball passing
I'iruueb bis hat. As I ran and jumped
the fence Fow.er and his son be^au tirine.
I di.l not return the fire, but began run
iiiii-r. Fowler, his son and others cave
clia.se on horseback, firing at me many
times.
'â¢Phecba'S was an excitintr one as we
went up over tne hill, but 1 finally gave
out and crawled into a hole. When the
pursuers came I gave up and wtis 'aiten to
Cuolame and given an examination be!oj;e
Judae Watkins, being charged with as
sault witn a deadly weapon with intent to
commit murder. I was nekl to answer
before the Superior Court, and Constables
HtoKer and Ward brought me here. I
have no idea what they will dv with me.
'â¢I have a mother somewhere in Mon
terey County, but l don't know just where.
I liave not heard from her for a long time.
Yon may say that the wounding oi \Vood
ruff was accidental and that at that time I
ha ; no intention of doing any shooting."
The story told by the constables tallies
in most re-peels with that of Hart, witli
the exception that they claim tlie boy
stole the hor-e at or near Bakersficld in
stead of trading for it.
NEWS OF SAN JOSE.
The Bulb Show Continues to Attract
Large Crowds, No withstanding the
Unpleasant Weather.
SAN JOSE, Cai,., Feb. 10.â The bulb
show at Turn Verem Hali is a grand suc
cess. Despite the stormy weather this
evening there was a large attendance 1 .
The collection of bulbs is the finest ever
held on the coa*t and the lalie3 of the
Santa Clara County Floral Society are re
cipients of much praise for having in
augurated so successful a show.
A fine musical programme, under the di

from the stage. It was as follows:
Vocal solo, "MyDriam of You," Miss Mar

Some cf the Ladies Who Have
Ably Assisted the Directors of
the Cloverdale Citrus Fair.
MENDOCINO DAY
AT CLOVERDALE
Throngs of Ukiah Citizens
Fleck to the Citrus
Exhibit.
Snow Succumbs to Sunshine and
the Greatest Enthusiasm
Is Manifested.
Visitors Astound?d at the Quantity
and Qua'iiy cf the Magnificent
Display.
CLOVERDALE, Cal., Feb. 19. âNo
huge Bnow man with oranges for eyes,
oranges for a nose and oranges for a
mouth greeted the Ukiah excursionists on
their arrival this afternoon to view the
Citrus Fair. The snow has all melted ex
cept high on tuo mountains where the
chill wind has full sweep: but the rounded
peaks, clothed in white, add a p;ctureÂ«que
ness to the scene that is not only a nov
elty, but an example of the diversity of
climate above and below of this section.
The people from Ukiah and intervening
town 9 made the most enthusiastic excur
sion that has yei come into Cloverdale
during the fair. There was a long train
load of them. The clou Is having; rolled
by, they marched in a long procession
through the main -treets to the pavilion,
glad to bfl on the scene, glad to represent
their own towns and rejoicing in the
variety of resources of the northern
Sonoma Valley, wbicn are year by year
mating themselves better Known not
only in their own State, but all over the
I world. The large amount of home pride
I that the people of northern Sonoma
Valley tate in the Cloverdale Citrus Fair
is not usual with such exhibits and shows
. a healthy interest that argues well for the
products and enterprise of this section.
For genuine interest and local pride in
the festival Cloverdale and the other
cities of the valley far excel Fresno and
its line citrus fair of last December. In
proportion to population the attendance
is much larger. There arc people here
from Fresno and Los An^etes and they
are astonished at the quality and quantity
of citrus fruits.
In Spain horticultural records say there
is an orange tree 750 years old. which
during its last seascn bore 20.000 oranges,
great activity is being shown in this
vicinity in the planting of orange and
iemon trees that it will be only about 745
years short of 750 before the northern por
tion of this valley wiil be a competitor in
all markets for citrus fruits with other
sections of California.
One of the best indications of this i-i the
general interest among the people of the
valley in what has already been done.
Luiher Burbank of Sonoma has been here
several days, and ho is a horticultural
authority. He said this afternoon:
"As ornpared with all previous exhi
bition? of citrus fruits the present fair is
much more than an advancement â it is a
transformation. The flavor of the oranges
grown here equals any in the State. The
grain of the rini may be a little coarser
and the oranges larger, but that is an in
dication of young tr<>es. This section of
Sonoma County is destined to be an im
portant orange and lemon producing
country. The lemons are already super
fine.
"The pavilion was packoa again this
afternoon and to-ni^ht. One of the local
drawing cards is Miss Mahelle Smith, a
young lady cornet-soloist, 17 years of age.
She has talent and a rare expression in
execution, and a large share or the ap
plause of tne promenading multitude goes
to her. The address of thÂ« evening was
delivered by Mrs. Anna Morrison Reed of
Laytonville. a handsome woman, who is
said to have no equal in the State as a
lady orator.
She was introduced by Mrs. J. A.
Kleiser, and began with a story of the
Planting of the lirst experimental orange
trees by a lady of the speaker's acquaint
ance, who came across the plains to join
her husband in California. She referred
to the pluming of the famous "original 1 '
orange tree at Biiwell's Bar, Butte
County, and covered these fint attempts
at growing citrus fruits la California in
graphic and eloquen: laaiMiaee.
"Wherever the purple fig will mature to
perfection," said the speaker, "there
oranges may be grown, and as tine tigs as
I have ever seen were grown at Biuo
Lakes, Lake County. The orange crop for
the whole State of California for the season
of 18'J6-97 is estimate at 8375 carload*, the
*r< a set in orang-s 76,000 acre 9. With the
demand for California oranges all over the
Union and orders coming even from
Florida, an orange- producing State, and
the promised tariff protection, the orange
industry has as bright au outlook as any
in the State.
"I beiieve with General Cnipman that
California is destined to be the
'orchard of America.' Here in Sono
ma, with your 960,000 acres of land
as rich and productive as ever smi.eii
in tne face of heaven â all of which, ex
cept that bordering on tbe coast,
can be successfully cultivated to
the fig, the grape, the olive and
the orange, with rapid and cheap
transportation by a railroad wbos>Â«
management is renowned from one bound
ary of the State to the other for its gener
osity and fairness 10 the citizen and the
producer, you Bbould be the banner citrus
producing oounty of Northern California.
You people have no excuse for poverty;
you have every opportunity and ncentive
to be self-support in c, independent and
even rich. I hope that every men, woman
and- child within the sound of my voice
will go home from this fair and plant an
oranee tree.
"The people who have planned these
â¢//" A3 yfu*n->
citrus fairs and carried them to a success
ful termination deserve the gratitude of
this community and the State at laree.
Fairs were the first markets of the world,
and to-day they are its be*t mode of ad
vertisement and medium of education for
the masses, who are best taught by the
method of these great object lessons."
Mrs. Reed paid a tribute to the fertility
and natural resources of Lake and Mendo
cino counties, which badly needed rail
roads and better public highways, and
concluded: "The omnge and lemon trers
which adorn your dwelling-place will sup
port you."
The day's festivities terminated with a
dance at night at Union Hal), across the
street from ttie pavilion. Supper was
served in the pavilion.
To-morrow is San Francisco day. Sev
eral parties aie expected up from the City,
including one witu H. J. Crocker, who
has a fine ex ibit at the fair. On Sunday
the pavilion will remain open, but there
will be no special programme. Other ex
cursions will arrive on Monday from Santa
Rosa, Petaluma and HealdsDurg.

PITIFUL PLIGHT
OF A POSTMASTER
Robbed the Government to
Satisfy His Hungry
Creditors.
So Strongly Importuned That He
Was Unable to Stand
the Strain.
In His Cell Ha Now Prays for His
Heartbroken Wife and
Daughters.
PORTLAND, Ok., Feb. 19.â Postmaster
Craig, the defaulting Eugene official in
the sum of $2uOO or more, is in a pitiful
state. United States District Attorney
Murphy, who came from Eugene this
afternoon, says: "He makes no denial of
his guilt, and when asked as to his mo
tive in embezzling such a sum makes the
answer, 'I was in debt, and my creditors
bothered me so much that, to obtain re
lief from them, I took the Government's
money. I owed almost all the money
here in Eugene, and I could not walk a
block without meeting some one I owed or
passing a store on the books of which I
was entered as a debtor.
â¢' 'I could not stand tha strain. 1 paid
one bill by uaing Government money. The
other creditors heard cf this settlement,
and they demanded that their accounts
also be settled. I paid them, hoping in
some way to return the post office funds
used. I couldn't, ana now I'm under ar
rest as a thief. God help my poor wife
and daughters! But tiieu I had to pay
niy debts.'
"It is Craig's family that makes the
affair most piteous," continued Mr. Mur
phy. "His wife and two daughters are
about heartbroken. Upon me they seemed
to lay every bit of their trouble. I was to
blame for the husband and father being
held over to answer for his crime, and I
was responsible for the breaking up ot
their home, and in the manner of women
they told me what they thought. Never
have I encountered before such an experi
ence, nor do I want to again."

PORTLAND, Or., *eb, 19â A commer
cial traveler for a local house, S. W. Hell
man, just in from Polk County, reports
that within the past few days three tramps
have been running things with a high
hand among the isolated farmhouses in
that locality. When they first made their
appearance Mr. Hellman said he heard
this trio was armeo. with nothing but
heavy sticks, presumably picked up on
the road, but now it is claimed they are
supplied with two shotguns and revolvers.
Tnese weapons they must have stolen
from some of the farmers.
The robbers are well mounted, and
judging from their appearance they did
not come by their horses honestly. These
fellows have been quite carefuf to visit
farmhouses where not more than one cr
two men were in sight. They were not
successful in getting much money, as
that article is scarce among most of the
Polk County farmers, but they despoiled
them of all other articles of value that
they couid rind about the premises.
It is more tuan barely probable that
these fellows are Burn?, Brown and Con
ley, the burglars recently escaped from
the cfty prison here, but how they could
have succeeded in reaching Polk County
without rearrest, after descriptions had
been wired all over the State, remains to
be explained, unless no reward wa3 offered
for tueir capture.

' SLO USE WORKS SLOWLT.
Another Appropriation Bill Is Taken
Vp ana J>iscus*etl.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 19.âAn
other appropriation bill was taken up in
the House to-day, but little progress was
made. The measure was that carrying
appropriations to supply deficiencies for
the current fiscal year and prior years. It
encountered its first snag when Grow
(R.) of Pennsylvania insisted that be had
a right to speak as long as he wanted to
on it. This position was discussed for
some time and resulted in a victory for the
venerable Pennsylvania member, who de
voted some extended remarks not on the
appropriation bill, but the Oklahoma free
homestead measure. Then a long discus
sion was started by Richardson (D.)
of Tennessee, over an item to pay special
attorneys for defending suits against the
United States.
Richardson wanted to know the use
of paying attorneys to defend such cases
when the judgments given against the
United States, particularly under the
Bowman act, were never paid. Many
members spoke in regard to the propriety
of paying the Bowman claims, but when
the afternoon was nearly over the discus
sion was dropped. The Di.'l was not
finished at 5 o'clock, when the House took
a recess for three hours. To-nignt it dis
cussed private pension bills. Sayers
(JJ.) of Texas gave notice that he would
offer amendments to the deficiency appro
priation bills in behalf of the Southern
Pacific Railway Company.
Two hours were frittered away by the
House to-night over the private calender.
Friday evenines under the rules are de
voted exclusively to the consideration of
private pension and relief bills.
When the House met at 8 o'clock Talbot
(D.) of South Carolina wanted to call up a
measure granting a pension to the widow
of General Rice of lowa, but his motion
was ruled out by the chair, Sherman (R.)
of New York, on the ground that it could
be made only in committee of the whole.
Then filibustering began. Rollcalls on
points of no quorum and on motions to
adjourn followed each other. Just before
10 o'clock the Committee on Invalid
Pensions decided to give up the attempt
to do business, and the House at 9:55 ad
journed until to-morrow.

BIG DAMAGES FOR
CHARLES A. LEE
The Southern Pacific Rail
road Company Must
Pay $8oo(
No Variance, Says tie Supreme
Court, in the Jiry's
Findings.
Tte Company's Clever iuse at Law
Fails of Its Intenâ Trial
Jadee Reverse.
.The Southern Pacific Rilroad Com
pany will pay Charles A. LÂ»e the sum of
$8000 damages, with no chmce to dodee
. the is tie. That was the deision of the
"buprerae Court nanded do-n yesterday.
â¢Leo brought action agaibt the South
ern Pacific Railroad Compny to recover
damages for personal injures sustained
by him. His plea wai that;he company
was the owner ol a cÂ« :ain rilway in the
. County of Los Angeles, and that at the
time of the injuries coinpaiied of he was
employed as urakeraan; thatwhile in the
.performance of his duties at a siding
called Honby he was throwr.from an en
gine upon which he was ridng and bus
â¢ tamed aer.ous injuries.
. He further alleged that thicanse of the
' acciden;was the negligence of the com-
Dany in imperfectly congtrucing the rails
and track at Honby and alowing them
to remain in that condition.
In answer the company Emitted the
ownership of the road in cjestion, but
Claimed that it was not re*poiÂ»ible for any
accidents, as prior :o tne ;ime of the
brak man's injury it had ioaed the road
and all the rolling stock to he Southern
Pacific Company of Kentucky. I: also
denied that Lee was ever in i:s employ as
brakeman or in any other edacity, and
that the road was imperlectlyconstrucied
or out of repair.
The jury returned a generd verdict in
â Lee's ;avor for $8000. It also made st^cal
findings of fact upon crtaii interroga
tories presented. Briefly suruuanzed they
were: That defendant owned the road in
question, but that as rlnimed it hÂ»d been
leased together with the roli.ng atom to
the Southern Pacific Cotnpi.nv of Ken
tucky; that the Southern facific Com
pany had constructed the sile line, and
that the plaintiff was at the tfnie of the
accident ii the employ of the latter
company.
The trial court determined that a con
flict existed between the special findings
and thege-ieral verdict, and hiding that
uiuier the lormer tne cojupaiy was en
titled to the verdict, rendere. judgment
accordingly. Leo appealed Ihe case to
the Supreme Court.
In i:Â« riecision the Supreme Court
quoied seciion 1 article XII of tne consti
tution, which declares that the Legisla
ture shall pass no law prnutting the
alienation of any franchise so as to re
lieve the. franchise or property beld there
under from the liability' of t.ie lessor or
grantor, lessee or grantee, contracted or
enjoyed in the operation of the franchise,
or any of iis pnvileg-s. After a learned
dissertation on the law involved the court
reached the following conclu-i>ns:
That the proofs disclosed i^ee to be in
the employ of the Southern Pacific Com
pany and the slight variance in the cvi-
. dance immaterial. The amount could be

The Unemployed Arrang

quarters.
Cooked on the Big Range for
the First Time Last
Evening.
Lumber, Kitchen Utensils and Viuals
Were oba:ned by Solicitors
Yesterday.
The unemployed spent yesterday in col
lecting materials to make their new quar
ters, 614 Howard street, habitable and the
night in making the most of what they
obtained.
Chairman Leffingwell announced in the
afternoon that none except those who hat
proper credentials signed by the chairman
and secretary would be permitted to col
lect contributions and that all others
would be considered impostors and ex
pelled from the hall and its privileges.
Some of the solicitors who went out dur
ing the day to canvass for supplies met
with lair success, but the majority came
back dishear:e:ied with the answers they
received.
"The Salvation Array has tne town bo
thoroughly covered," said Chairman Lef
fingwell in explaining the mutter, "that
we find it hard 10 get even enough to feed
these hundreds of hungry men.
"All we want is enough to keep the
boys from hunger and give them a place
to sleep unt.l they can get work, when, of
cours . they will oe off our hands.^
"In many ca-es we have asked bakeries
and luaikels to divide their charity be
tween us and the army, and have
promised to do so.' ?
One solicitor who called on the Simpson
Lumber Company yeÂ«:erd.ay was glad
dened by an order for 2000 feet of lumber,
and last night the merry munc of saws
and hammers resounded through the hall
as carpenters ainon^- the unemployed
knocked the rougn boards into tables and
tenches on which to leed the crowd.
Oilier solicitors obtained stovepipe and
stove connections, and at 7 o'c ocfc t c
chairman leaned over the gallery in the
south end of the hall and said:
"Boys, the range is in place and in a
short time there will be coffee, bread,
potatoes and meat for all."
'ihis announcement was greeted with
cheers and the poor fellows, many of
whom had not eaten for twenty-four
hours, began to take heart and talk of the
time when welcome employment could be
obtained. It is needless to say that all
fell to with a will when thp cooks had
served the food smoking hot m vessels
that had been contributed during the day.
Finger* served for knives and" forks in
many instances, but the victuals disap
peared rapidly even with this handicap.
Several hundred men spent the night in
the bic hall curled up in corners or sleep
ing with their heads on the tables. It in
hoped to obtain enough lumber to-day to
build bunks for a great many. The fol
lowing contributions were obiained yes

TRUSTED A STRANGER.
Gui*ie Arnold A,Â«;uiltcil by a Man to
Whom She Applied fur Informa
tion.
James O'Connell, a laborer, was arrested
yesterday afternoon by J. T. Harris, a citi
zen, and charged with felonious assault.
The complaining witness is Gussie Arnold,
who resides at lf>6 Tehama street.
About 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon
Miss Arnold started to the Almshouse to
visit a relative, who is an inmate of that
institution. When near the junction of
Seventh avenue and M street she inquired
of O'Connell the road to the A!msiiou->e.
The latter volunteered to direct her and
according to her story, led her through a
ravine, which -he said was the most direct
route.
At a point between Seventh and Eighth
avenues and Land M streets c grasped
her by the throat and a .struggle ensued.
J. T. Harris witnessed the struggle and
placed O'Connell underarrest. O'Connell
made no resistance and Harris marciied
his man to Devisadero street, where he
lu.ned him over to Policeman Foley.

Such a Remark About

His Brief Evidence Before the
Commissioner Yes
terday.
Says He Was Bound for England and
Did Mot Wish to Remain
Here.
The fortunate few, comparatively speak
ing, who attended the Asbe extradition
proceedings before Commissioner Hea
cock yesterday were rewarded for their
trouble by \viines>ing more than one epi
sode which might rightly be character
ized as at least interesting if not sensa
tional. Incidentally the defense scored
several technical' triunipiis, though no
serious attempt was maiie io rebut the ac
cumulated nias3 of testimony aeainst the
prisoner. The only new witness called to
the stand yesterday was Ashe himself.who
denied when questioned by Mr. Black
that he had ever stated that the portrait
of Mr 3. Lee Weller found among his effects
was the portrait of lus wife. The several
witnesses who so testified early in the
hearing were at once recalled by the prose
cution in rebuttal and again swore posi
tively that the prisoner actually made
-ucti a statement ana that his testimony
alleging otherwise was false.
As soon as the court convened at 2
o'clock Mr. Black, who seems to be the
head and front of the defense, held alolt
a typewritten document which proved to
be the bill of sale transferring certain of
the pri-oner's effects to Attorney Pidwell.
â¢I will call Mr. Roche," said Mr. Biacfc.
"You are familiar with the prisoner's
handwriting?" he asked.
"I am," replied the witness.
"You recognize this signature?" indi
cating the name at tne foot of the bill of
sale.
"I do. I believe it to be the signature
of the prisoner."
"1 desire." said Mr. Black, "to offer this
paper in evidence."
Mr. Cormac rose hastily. "We have a
few objections to make, your Honor," he
began. "First we contend that documen
tary evidence is not competent on behalf
of ihe~p; isoner â " â¢
Mr. Bhtck here interposed to explain
that he introduced the paper for the
reason that these proceedings were based
on a warrant seeking not only the Drison
er's person, but certain personal properly
in his possession. The purpose of this
paper was to 'how the fact tnal although
certain personal property might under the
extradition treaty and at the discretion of
tl.e Government oi the United States be
delivered, yet the rights of tnird parties
must be respected. The document was
not introduced on behalf of the prisoner.
Mr. Corniac, however, further objected
to its introduction on the ground that Mr.
J'lcweli was not a third party in the mean
ing of the treaty; that the bill of sale pur
ported to b- made by Lee Weiler, wnile
the proaei ur.on had proved Lee Weiler to
be dead; that the property was evidence
of crime and that the document was de
signed to defeat the purposes of j stice;
that it was intended to interlere with the
United States Marshal in the fulfillment
of i is duty.
"If such a document could be drawn up
at any time," c mtinued Mr. Cormac, "by
a prisoner after his seizure with such evi
dences ot his crime in his possession it
would be very eusy to defeat the ends oi
justice. TaKe the case of counterfeit coin.
Should the coin found in his possession
be deeded to Fidwell or anybody else it
would l.c a simple matter to secure the
very evidence upon which the prosecution
has to reiy for a conviction. No doubt,
too, Ashe, or Butler, owned the rifle with
which it is alleged Lee Weiler was shot.
If at his trial he could make a deed of gift
of that rifle to somebody el-e he would
thereby do away witn the evidence
against him and make it impossible to
convict.
"We contend that no such transfer of
Droperty after seizure and apprehension
can be made. The rights oi third parties
mentioned in the treaty refer to the origi
nal owner, and not to "the person obtain
ing the articles after apprehension, it
property is taken from a man bis rights,
of couise, must be respected, but after
the prisoner has come into this jurisdic
tion with the property on his person it is
too late to obtain a bill of said and thereby
try to defeat the ends ol justice. We
further object on the ground that the bill
of sale was made to one Mr. Pidwell, and
'.hat he is the prisoner's attorney, and we
insist that any means by which they try
to circumvent an order of yoar Honor's is
contempt of you and of tiie court, and I
Co not think your Honor will consider the
argument for one moment. We also ob
ject on the ground that the property
sought to be obtained by this bill of sale
in the very same property found upon the
prisoner and put in evidence; that more
will be put in evidence, and that it was
testified in both cases that this property
is material evidence, necessary on his
trial, and that under the treaty we are
bound to keep these articles In the pos
*ession of this court."
Mr. Black replied at length to the pre
vious speaker's objections. The prisoner,
he argued, was seized without right and
his property taken away from him with
out any authority, writ, warrant or order.
The prisoner while in thia position saw tit
to m.ike a bill ot -ale. The attorneys for
the delense had formerly been criticized
i>y the prosecuting officer for not attempt
ing to take away this property from tne
cuÃiody of toe court. The effect of these
ooj etions wai to throw discredit upon
thu prisoner's counsel for doing something
in a legal manner and by the adjudication
of a com p -tent tribunal with a view to
establishing the title to this property, and
not omy doing that but trying 10 estab
lish that right in this court.
No attempt, he assured his Honor, was
being made to remove the property from
the custody of the court. Neither the
grantee of this bill of sale nor any of the
prisoner's counsel had at any time or now
aiUÂ»mpifd to do so. The defense had
merely sought to remove it from the cus
tody of a privat- person, to wit, Barry
Baldwin. Mr. Black further explained
witli much technicality of language that
the defense merely sought to establish the
legality of the transfer to the grantee of
any such right as the prisoner might have
to the property in question. And the de
fense also tendered 10 the United States
Government all such articles as might be
deemed of value to the British Govern
ment in the prosecution of the defendant.
These ar'icles he enumerated as follows:
Songs oi England, pocket encyclopedia,
piece of paper relating to documents and
will of .L*e M. Weiler, photograph of
prisoner, photograph of Mrs. Lee Weiler,
song entitled, "We All Love Jack," to
geiuer with all certificates, discharces,
etc., made out in^theuame of the mur
dered man.
Cornmis-ioner Heacock said that the
rights of the claimant mu*t first be re
spected as fully under the asMjjnmeiit as
if there bad been no such document in
me case, lie apprehended tliat when all
ihe testimony was in there would be very
little property ol value which it would
not be deemed necessary to hold in favor
Ot the prosecution.
"The prisoner will take the stand." said
Mr. Black suddenly, and there was an im
mediate revival of interest among the
spectators.
Mr. Cormac wanted to know the pur
pose of the examination. Was it to be
for general purposes or only with regard
to tins assignment?
"It is our desire," replied Mr. Black,
"to ask him only about three questions,
not concerning the bill of sale. I can
fully explain wbat I want to ask if tne
court desires."
The prisoner being directed to take the
stand rose clumsily and after taking the
customary oath with hand uplifted and
apparent unconcern sat down comfortably
and awaited developments. Deputy Mar
shal Gallagher followed his charge to the
witness-stand and sat down by him.
Mr. Black having obtained the photo
graph referred to as representinc Mrs.
Lee Weller handed it to A-^he and said:
"Prisoner, you beard a previous witness
in tbis case make a statement that you
said to him tnat this picture was the pic
ture of your wife?"
"I did not say go," replied Ashe calmly.
"Was it a fact?"
"It was not."
"Did you ever make such a statement?"
"Never."
"Prisoner, you heard a certain testimony
concerning a white powder found in your
hat?"
"Yes."
"Do you know of any white powder be
ing in your hat prior to your arrest?"
"I do not. I did not put any white
powder there"
"You cume to the port of San Francisco
on the ship Swanhilda?"
"1 did."
"Where were you bound?"
"San Francisco."
"From there, where?"
"Home to England."
"Had you any intention of remaining in
San Francisco or the United States?"
"No."
Then the statement made by the cap
tain of the ship, that you desired to get
off atonce, was that true?"
"I object," cried Mr. Cormac."
"Take the witness."
"Lee Weller is your name?" asked Mr.
Ccrmac
Ihe court, failing to hear the prisoner,
asked, "What name?'
"Lee Weller."
"That," he added hastily, "is the name
I shipped under."
"Is it your name !" asked Mr. Cormac.
"I object," cried Mr. Black. "The ques
tion is immaterial and incompetent."
"How loner,' 1 continued Mr. Cormac
"have you been kDown as Lee Weller?"
"I object," from Mr. Black.
"That is no objection," said Mr. Cormac
sharply. "You must state the point of
your objection."
"The prisoner," replied Mr. Black
promptly, "has been aslced no question
by counsel as to who he was other than
that he was the prisoner, and 1 submit
that an investigation as to what his name
is or has been is wholly immaterial and is
not cross-examination."
The courtâ l think, perhaps, you are
right. It is certainly not desirable to
open the door to an investigation as to
what hhitrue name was.
"Thatls all," said Mr. Cormac.
The prisoner left the stand and had al
most reached his seat when Mr. Black be
thought him of several additional inter
rogatories.
"Di l yon leave the ship BwanhildÂ» of
your own free will?"
"Yes," came the nnhesitating reply.
But this didn't suit Mr. Black. "Think
before you answer," he said warningly.
"I was taken off by the police of
course."
Mr Cormac then called Sergeant Bun
ner. Detective Roche, Detective McHattie
and Constable Conroy in rebuttal 01 the
prisoner's testimony, denying that he ever
referred to Mrs. Lee Weller as his wife.
All four were emphatic in reaffirming
that the prisoner had so stated in tueir
presence, and ah four stigmatized his
pretent denial as untrue.
Conroy, Roche and McHattie were again
called by the prosecution to give furtner
evidence in the Lee Weller case ana to
identify the various articles found among
the prisoner's baggage as having belong d
to the murdered man. Mr. Black sub
jected the three witnesses to a very search
ing cross-examination, in which he sought
to obtain a detinue explanation of me
necessity for particular ariicles at the trial
in Australia and the exact grounds upon
which the witnesses based their conclu
sions that such articles originally belonged
to Lee Weller.
Roche went through the ordeal without
flinching, and expressed his conviction
that nearly everything found in the pris
oner's possession was siolon property." He
also informed the court that some of the
articles belonging to Lee Weller were
stolen from their owriT before the date of
the murder, during teller's brief stay at
a Sydney lodging-house. All this testi
mony, however, was subsequently stricken
out by order of the court as entirely ir
relevant to the present issue.
This closed the case on both sides, argu

A revolver and a bullet-hole in the left
breast told the story.

ATTORNEYS WHO
WOULD NOT OBEY
Counsel for Chinese Gam"
biers Adjudged in
Contempt
They Refused to Bring Forward
Their Client When
Ordered.
The Committed Lawyers Sue Out a
Writ of Habeas Corpus and Will
Fight thi Order.
Another considerable snag was encoun
tered yesterday in tne prosecution of ttie
Chinese rounded up in the recent raid on
the so-called social clubs. The trial of
i'ee Chung for visiting a g3mbling-housa
was to have taken p'aC3 before Jud^e
Joachimseti at 2 o'clock yesterday, but
tiiA aforesaid sna? loomed up with
foÃnidable aggressiveness before the pro
ceedings had fairly commenced.
"When the name of the defendant, who
had already pleaded not guilty, was called
Attorneys J. F. Smith and Joseph F.
Coffey answered ready. Behind them sat
a Jong row of stolid-looking Celestials, and
there was nothing in their demeanor to
indicate which was the entciled Yee
Chung, who was about to undergo trial.
Davis Louderback, who has been em
ployed by the Chief of Police as special
prosecutor, objected to this. He de
manded that the defendant be brought to
tne bar. Smith and Coffey objected vio
lently. They declared that the proceed
ing demanded was simply to allow tha
police to see who the defendant was so
they could identify him on the stand as
the man urrestod.
A wordy war ensued between the attor
neys, and Judge Joachimsen finally or
dered '.he deiendant's attorneys to pro
due their man.
"With all due respect to your Honor,"
said Attorney Smith, "we decline to obey
your order," and matters had to come 10
an issue.
Louderhack was equal to the occasion.
He suggested to the court that the attor
neys were clearly in contempt. The
Judge, who looked upon the attorneys' re
fusal to comply with his order as an at
tempt to delay the trial, acquiesced in At
torney Louderback's opinion and held
both the defendants' attorneys to be in
contempt. He lined them each $101) and
committed them to. the custody of the
Sheriff lor twenty-iour hours. The case
was then postponed until Tuesday after
noon.
iSniith and Coffey immediately sued out
a writ of habeas corpus before Judge Sea
weli, returnable before Judge Wallace
Tuesday at 10 o'clock. The attorneys in
tend to light the commitment on the
ground that a compliance with Judge
Joachimsen's order would be giving evi
aence against their c.ient, failure of iden
tification being the chief defense relied
upon.
MRS. MORLOCK EXONERATED.
Judge Coffey Says thÂ« Charge* Against
Hit Are Untrue.
Judge Coffey yesterday rendered a de
cision in favor of Mrs. Mary Morlock, who
was charged with having dealt unfairly
with the estaie of Margaret McGarrity, an
incompetent person.
A number of accusations were lodged
against Mrs. Morlock, and all these were
by the court declared unproved and un
true. After the decision, Mrs. Morlock
tendered her resignation as guardian of
Mrs. McGarrity, and a new guardian will
be appointed by the court.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL, fe
SATURDAY FEBRUARY 20, 1397
THE FAKE AND THE FACT.
â thb FAKE
The Examiner published for several days at the
top of its title page the following fake:
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
249,757 Inches
Of Ads During J896.
5964 More
Than were published by any
other San Francisco newspaper.
In the publication of this fake the Examiner
was probably not aware that a careful record was
being kept of the actual amount in Inches of Its
advertising and that in consequence it could be
confronted with the following fact.
THE PACT
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
236,528 Inches
Of Ads During J896.
That is one fact and here is an-
other :
THE CALL PUBLISHED
239,551 Inches
Of Ads During J896.
3,023 More
Inches were published in
THE CALL than in the
Examiner during 1896.
It Is to be remembered that daring 1896 the
Examiner published approximately 800 inches of
illegal lottery advertisements, of which Tub Cam.
did not and would not pabilsti one.
The monarch of the falter* has doubtless suc-
ceeded in securing thousands of Inches of adver-
tising during the past year by dupjn; and deceiv-
ing advertisers through false and arrogant asser-
tions of the Character of the foregoing fake. It
would seem, however, from the facts that the
merchants as a rnle have not been misled by Its
iraudulent pretenses.
The Examiner boasts that Its books are open to
Inspection, but we suggest that it luipect Its own
looks before It venture* noon the publication of
another fake.
We congratulate the public on the fact that the
rirosure of this fake led the Examiner to drop It.
In this the Examiner was discreek, and If it Is wise
1: will make no mote such bold attempts to
â¢iweive the public

A LIFE WORTH LIVING.
The gathering of men and women of light and learning at the Mark Hopkins
Institute on Thursday evenine to do honor to Dr. and Mrs. Jo>eph Le Conte and to
celebrate with them the occasion of their golden wedding was in many respects a
notable one. It was an evidence that the people of California appraise at their true
value the character and services of a man who, without wealth and without official
station, has done so much to give California honor wherever science, learning and the
nobility of a true manhood are esieetneJ.
It was a happy coincidence that enabled a graduate of the University of Califor
nia, a student in the classrooms of Professor Le Conte, to appear in the assembly
holding the high office of Governor of the State and having the opportunity to an
nounce that he would sign the bill j-ust passed by the LÂ°gtslature providing for the
university the increased appropriation which is necessary for its proper maintenance
&nd growth.
All the circumstances of the occasion were felicitous. The very scene of the
gathering was an emblem of the tribute which wealth pays to culture, for the stately
building erected to be the home of the p-ofuse hospitality oi a millionaire is now de
voled to public education and is a part of that university of whose life Professor Le
Conte has been so large and so influential a part. The scene, the assembly and the
occasion were in harmony, and the fathering will long be remembered by all who
attended it and even by many who know it only from report.
President Kellogg, in presenting to Dr. and Mrs. Le Conte the loving-cup of puie
gold, accurately summed up the nature of the services rendered by the professor in
saying: "This man has been more thau a university professor. He has entered into
the life of this community and has become a name to conjure by. Californians are
proud of his National and trans-Atlantic reputation. His late visit to the Eastern
States and to England has shown us how certain it is that we own a foremost man of
science, a writer of renown, an acknowledged authority in the higher ranges of
thought.''
In responding to the address of President Kellogg and in giving thankg for him
self and noble wife, Dr. Le Conte attributed much of the success he has achieved and
the eminence he has attained to tho influences of California and the university.
'When I came t6 California." he said, "I quickly absorbed the inspiration of a new
civilization. The moment I reached the State I felt the quickening effects of the
forces that were engaued in laying the foundation of a great commonwealth on the
western border of the continent. 1 ' To these influence?, we know, the professor re
sponded deeply and sympathetically, and themtasureof what he has accomplished
serves as a test by which we may estimate what are the dominant influences of Cali
fornia life upon men of true culture and noble aspirations.
Most cheering were the words which the professor spoke of the university. When
he became identified with it it was an institution almost without support and of very
small promise of speedy success. Nevertheless there was in it a potency to inspire
those who loved it, and Professor Le Conte bore witness to that power when in
speaking of his early association with the university he said: "I felt then a quick
ening influence. I felt as I feel nowâ that it, was founded on more natural principles
than any other. I have watched it grow until it stands in the first rank of the educa
tional institutions of the country."
A life of this nature devoted to noble ends which has been blessed with the satis
faction of seeing all the work in which it has engaged prosper, and all the institu
tions to which it was devoted flourish and increase, has most certainly been a happy
one. Such a lire is well worth the living. It is gratifying to know that the life thus
lived is not ended and that it has been prolonged to see the University of California
enter into a new and more brilliant era of its history by reason of the increased appro
priations made for its work. The golden wedding of Dr. and Mrs. Le Conte promises
to be for them the beginning of a golden era in theirjJives, and it will be the wish of
â 11 that it may be long continued in health and capacity for unwearying service of the
kind that has been rendered in the past.
AN ALASKAN EEPRESENIATIVE.
The American population in Alaska has
now become so large and has developed
such business interests in that Territory
as to feel the need of better legislation,
and to obtain that they are now seeking
from Congress the right to eiect a repre
sentative who will look after their inter
ests at Washington. In doing this they
are simply following an impulse natural
to Americans, and deserve to be successiul
in the task.
AH of us would act as the Alaskans are
now doing if we were in the same situa
tion. Wherever any number of Ameri
cana are gathered on a soil under tne
American flag, it is right and proper that
they should feel themselves entitled to
representation at Washington. Every
American Territory should have that
privilege, and even if there were no spe
cial reasons for ernntlne the requests of
the Alaskans it should be done on those
general principles which underlie our po
litical system.
It is not, however, solely upon the gen- I
eral right of Americans to have a repre
sentative at Washington that the Alas- '
kans are basing their requests. They have
reasons peculiar to the condition of j
Alaska which prompt them to the move
ment and add to the justice of their
claims. At the present time the white
population of Alaska numbers about 12.. '
000, and the business interosts are by no \
means inconsiderable. The government
of the Territory, however, is an anomaly
in American law. There is at present no i
such thing as a land law in the Territory, j
and those who go there to make homes ,
and to erect houses have to content them
selves with such titles as they can get
from a squatters' claim.
la various other ways the progress of
the country is hindered by the lack of
favorable legislation. The Territory is re
mote from the seat of the National Gov
ernment, and is easily overlooked by
Representatives who have no local inter
ests in it. As a result it is difficult for the
people of Alaska to obtain from Congress
anything like the attention which the im
portance of the Territory and the Welfare
of its white population demand.
The fact that the white population is
much smaller than is required to elect a
Representative to Congress in other parts
of the United States does not constitute a
valid objection to the claims of the Alas
kans. They are situated differently from
the inhabitants of other parts of the
Union. They are remote from the seat of
Government, and have many difficult
problems to contend with in building up
the vast Territory they occupy. It would
be iff lull accord with the general princi
ples of our Government to give them a
Representative in Congress, and this
should be done at the present session so as
to enable the Alaskan delegate to take his
seat when the next Congress assembles at
its regular session next fall.
It will be remembered that before the
Bradley Martin ball was held it was
everywhere asserted it would cost about
$300,000. Now that it is over, however,
tne New York papers are revising their
estimates, and some o! them declare the
ball itself did not cost more than $50,000,
and the expenditures of the guests made
especially for the occasion did not exceed
$75,000. These sums are high, but they
are not rank.
One of the most important positions
McKinley will have to fill will be that of
Minister to Spain. It will not be so pleas
ant a place as some others, but the right
man will find an opportunity in it to make
a record to be proud of.
The New York Chamber of Commerce is
talking of giving Cleveland a complimen
tary dinner on bis retirement from office,
and as a matter of fact the whole country
wouldn't object to celebrating the occasion
with feasting.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1897.
NEW CONDITIONS.
In the memorial presented by a com
mittee of the State Board of Trade to the
Governor the statement is made that
"never before the present time in the his
tory of this State have the inducements to
immigration been so great." The com
mutes pointed out that these new condi
tions are the outcome of the past few
years of financial stringency, and it is
always doubly good news to hear of a
good that has been wrought out by what
seemed a grievous evil, since it help-, us to
work on with the renewed energy born of
the belief that by being watchful ap
parent losses may be made the means of
greater gain.
It is sta'.ed in the memorial that before
the recent hard times tne lands of Califor
nia were held at so exorbitant a price as
to be far beyond the reach of profitable in
vestment, and this false idea of values
greatly retarded the development of the
State. All this is now changed. "Lands
are no longer held at prices that anticipate
development, and out of this grows the
opportunity of renpiner the reward of that
enhancement which will necessarily ensue
upon the more dense settlement of thje
State."
The toppling of former air castles of
Imaginary wealth will clear the ground
for the building of substantial and en
during prosperity. The holding of the
lands with purpose to make fortunes out
of the expected increase in density of pop
ulation was the very thing that defeated
the desire of the holders. Had the prop
erty been put on tne marKet at prices pro
portionate to the demand the funds from
it might have been put into something to
promote active industry and turned over
many times with compounding profit in
stead of playing a barring out game of
seeking to gain wealth by shutting others
from opportunities of using nature's
bounties.
The new condition enforced by hard
times is an object lesson in the policy of
"live and let live." The multiplied In
dustry resulting from the establishment of
many hnppy homes on land that has been
held out of uÂ«e will redound to tenfold
wealth. It would have been so long ago if
the speculative holders had let the work
ers have full opportunity of production.
The old conditions may have been good,
but the new are bettor. All hail to them!
A BRITISH EXPERIENCE.
The New York Prett republisbes from
the Bradford (Eng.) Observer the letter of
a member of a British manufacturing
company defending the action of the
directors in paying dividends out of a
reserve fund, which clearly shows and
honestly states the effects produced in
England by the McKinley tarirf and by
the Wilson tariff.
The point of the letter of interest to
Americans is found in the following pas
sage :
You must admit that we have had to face no
ordinary difficulties, such as would have over
whelmed most concerns. Tha McKinlty bill
gave the finishing blow toSalialre and brought
Munninghain to its knees, and would have
utterly ruined the mucn-boasted trade ol
Bradford had not the Wilson bill come most op.
portunely to its relief. The McKinley bill took
half our trade away, bo that we were obliged
to reduce wages.
This statement, it will be neen. was in
tended simply to set forth the business
conditions of the manufacturing company
whose directors hart been denounced for
using a reserve fund to pay dividends. It
was in no sense intended for political
effect. It refers to American tariff legis
lation only to show how that legislation
affected the business of that particular
company, and the statements are too im
portant to be overlooked by Americans.
The McKinley tariff enabled this coun
try to manufacture its own goods. While
it was in force there was work for our fac
tories, employment for our people and a
home market for our farmers. English
manufacturing companies could not pay
dividends, but every American company
could and did. We would soon have
driven the English out of the American
market. As tne writer of the letter says,
"The McKinley bill gave the finishing
blow to Saltaire ami brought Manning
ham to its knees, and would nave utterly
ruined the much-boasted trade of Brad
ford had not the Wilson bill come most
opportunely to its relief."
With this British evidence before us we
can see how absurd are the charges of the
free-traders that the incoming Congress
may injure the country by re-enacting a
high tariff. The American people do not
propose to legislate for English factories,
but for those of America. We intend to
re-establish here au industrial system
that will give employment to our own
people. The Britisu manufacturer might
aÂ» well look to other lands for a market.
There will never be again in this genera
tion a Wilson bill to come opportunely to
their relief.

"Because 1 have never a leaf to show,
Because I stoop
And ray branches droop,
And the dull mosses over me grow I
1! it I'm alive in trunk and shoot;
The buds of next May
I fold away, â¢ -~
But I pity thÂ« withered grass at my root."
'â¢You think I'm dead."
The quick grass said,
"Because I have parted with stem and blade:
But under the ground
1 urn .safe and sound,
With the snow's thick blanket over me laid.
I'm all a'lve and rea iy to shoot
Should the spring of the year
Come dancing here:
But 1 pity the llower without branch or root."
"You think I am dead,"
A soft voice said,
"Because not a branch or root I own.
I never have died,
. But close I hide '
In a plumy seed the wind has sown.
Patient I wait through the long winter hours;
You will see me Â«caln â
I shall laugh at you then
Out ot the eyes of a hundred flowers."

ANSWERS TO CORRESfONLENTS.
An Inventionâ L. X., City. This department
cannot tell you what would be the value of an
Invention that would increase the speed of
Â»teaiuboat.Â« 40 Der cent, reduce the amount of
coal one-thirl and proportionately reduce the
amount ol labor and machinery, "but if you
hÂ»ve such au invention, you have a fortune."
You had better consult some one in the steam
boat business.
Detectivesâ For information, City. From
the standpoint ol those who make a business
of studying crime, criminals and their
methoJs the American detectives are the su
perior ot those of England for shrewdness and
results. Both countries have goodâ very
goodâ individual detectives, but those in the
United States are credited as a class with
being the shrewdest.
Water Mktkkâ L. E. 8., City. If yon have a
complaint as to the charges for water made by
the Spring Valley Company call on the Gas
and Water Inspector, whoso office Is In the
City Hall, an-i it becomes his duty under the
ordinances ol the City to have a test made and
determine the justness or unjustness of the
charge, and be Is empowered to have a meter
placed on the premises for the purpose of
ascertaining the quantity of water used by the
consumer.
Watf.rmklons â Concord, Contra Costa
County. Cal. It is probable that the reason
your watermelon crop hat failed is because it
has been attacked by the golnernea or yellow
striped bug which belongs to the beetle fam
ily. It Is said that a thin layer of tow spread
over the melon ptants when they first appear
will save them from the yellow Â«tr ped bug.
It is also suggested that to out a coop with
hens and chicks in the melon patch will de
stroy the bugs.
Alaska Fishing Cruiseâ J. S., Bolinas.Marin
County, Cal. If a boy wishes to ship on a fish
ing cruise to Alaska he must watch the ship,
ping news of The Call and when he sees a
vessel announced as going on suoh a cruise he
should mate application to the master of the
vessel. He might make application to gome
shipping-house in San Francisco, with a re
quest that he be notified when there might be
an opening. There is no fixed time for the
sailing of such vessels.
Back to Russiaâ R., San Jose, Cal. If a native
of Russia or Poland who left his country with
out having performed military duty, even
though he were a minor at the time, should
return to his native country he would be liable
to arrest for desertion and would have to per
form his military service. The fact that after
leaving his native country he hÂ»d become a
citizen of the United States wouid not save
him The motto of that country is a Russian
once, a Russian always.
A Corrkct Phraseâ F. W., City. The asser
tion, "My stock is the b-st; my prices low," is
correct. It would also be coirect If the writer
us>ed a period after "beat" and capitalized
"my." The inference to be drawn lrom ihe
assertion is that the individual has on hand a
varied stock of goods, and, of course, it is
natural to suppose that he has a different
price for each class, consequently 'prices low"
applies and in correct. If his stock was wholly
one class of goods, then tie would have to ut,e
"my price is low."

Fanny Rice's Little Djughter Loaded
With Oifts From the Members of
the Memorable Cast.
Fanny Rice has come to town, and this
time her three-year-old daughter is with
her. This little girl is quite a famous per

"actor tolks," as a great many people

LITTLE EDITH MUNDAY PURDY, the Mascot of * The Rivals " Company, in the Arms
of Joe Jefferson, the Veteran Actor.
Edith Munday Purdy was the mascot of
the "all-star cast" of "Tie Rivals," of
which her charming mother was a princi
pal. Contrary to the usual result with a
child who has traveled about aud been so
much made of, she is a modest, unassum
ing baby, who has a large family of dolls
to attend to, and the grave responsibility
of bringing them all up in the way they
should go quite upsets her.
L.ke her mother, stie is a jolly little
body, and when you have made friends
witn her she can entertain you by the
hour with what she calis ''olaying lady."
In other words, :-he stands up ou a chair,
and aiter Lowing once or twice, smilingly
recites "yards and yards" of "Al other
fioose" iv a moat mixed up way. It seems
that having once had her horoscope cast,
and the decision having been in favor of
a literary career, she has co.'nmonced
upon it already by linding flaws in the
construction of the ole" childhood stand
bys, insisting, for instance, that:
UUlc Miss MnftVt sa: on a luffel
1. ting a Cliiistmas pie:
she put in her th'imo
And pulled out a puim
And said, "I'm a good girl, ain't I?"
She is an affectionate little creature,
wbo loves her mamma, papa and her
nurse, "Caffie," almost to distraction,
and it might be added without deviating
from the truth at ail that her affection is
as strongly returned. Her soft baby curls
have beeii cutoff. "Incle Dee had that
done 'cause it made my head too hot,"
she said when questioned atout it. Then,
climbing into laffie'i lap, she demanded
a look at her watch, and after hearing it
tick away announced with a aiph, "I guess
it's time for Eddie 10 go to seep."
On her last birthday she was traveling
with "The Rivals," and alter the matinee
a birthday dinner was given tn her honor.
The special cur was decorated beautifully
with ribbons and .cads of flowers and
presents galore poured in to celebrate the
day.
Joseph Jefferson gave the child a gold
necklace with a diamond pendant; Nat
Goodwin, a set of baby pins, pearls and
diamonds; Francis Wilson, a beautifully
bound boot oi child lore; the Holland
brothers, a whole farmyard of mechanical
toys; William Crane, a life-sized talking
doll; Mrs. John Drew, jeweled box of
candy and a turquoise ring; Mr. and
Mrs. Tabor, a bracelet of emeralds and
diamonds; Mr. Jefferson's sons, Tommy
and Charles, a birthday cuke and a large
imported music-box.
"Glad to get back, here? Oh, my, yes,"
said Mrs. Purdy. "You know we've
always played here round the holidays,
and this year we missed it some way,
and, oh, you don't Know how awfully
lonely it seemed way in Ohio.- Something
seemed wrong. I always look forward to
my time in 'Frisco,' and I know 1 shall

FUNERAL CARRIAGES.
Judge Coffey Say* Teo Much Expense

"I think six carriages at a funeral like
that are too many," said Judgo Coffey in
objecting to an item in the undertaker's
bill againit tne estate of the late Mrs.
Frances Julia Pracy. Her estate is esti
mated to be worth $(Jt>o.
The attorney suggested that a similar
number o! carriage-* bad been supplied for
the funeral of Mrs. Pracy's nusband, Geo.
T. Pracy, wno died a short time before she
departed to the other world.
"That is no criterion," responded the
court. "I do not wi*h to incur the enmfty
of the hackmeu, but I really think that
six carriages are too many to charge
against an estate of this kind. I under

fact I don't believe in Dip funerals, though
some funerals would probably benefit the

the court, "but I cannot approve this

EL DOEADO'S ANNIVERSARY.

The fact that It was 9torroy and dis

of El Dorado Parlor, Native Sons of the
Golden West, from attending in large
numbers in Native Sons' Hall to take part
in the twelfth anniversary entertainment
arranged by the parlor.
There wa.s a great deal of taste dis

' *tace. The outer edce was fringed with

across a large American ii.is, and after the
grand march, led by C. C. Gunther and

, the flan was raised from the lower center
I until it formed graceful folds and expo-ed
another background of cerulean blue,
studded with gold stars and illumined
with numerous ii.iy incandescent liehts.
It wa-* a novel effect and much admired.

The Pacific Mail Steamship Company's
China is still in quarantine. The case of
varioloid reported to the quarantine of
ficers has proved to be more dangerous
than was first thought possible, and now
everybody will have to remain in quaran
tine until at least the 25th inst. Should
all go well the cnbin passengers may be
released on that dnte, bnt in any event the
month of March will be well born before
the steerage pnsscngers are allowed to
leave the station.
In the meantime the soldiers on Angel
Island will have something to do. A reg
ular guard will patTOl the hill over Quar
antine Cove night and day, and not a soul
will be allowed to leave the station except
in the quarantine boat. The cabin pas
sengers will be allowed the freedom of the
place, but those in the steerage will have
to conline their peregrinations to the reg
ular quarters. Those in the cabin of the
China are:
R. Christie, Mr. and Mr.Â«. C. B. Fernald, Mrs.

The uteainer will be fumigated and the
the Sausaiito and Tiburon ferry-boats
when day broke yesterday morning. The
schooner was lowed away up the bay, but
the captain of the Eversham Abbey waited
for the fbra of tuts tide and then, hoisting
bis anchor, ai lowed his vessel to drift
back to her oricinai anchorage. "We live
and learn," said an American skipper.
"Ninety-nine men out pi a hundred would
have taken a tugboat and got out of
danger, but the Britisher got good hold
ing ground and he made the tile take
him back to the place it took him from."
Over 12,000 tons cf coal are in the bay
awaiting an owner. Should the vesseis
dock and the cargoes be sold before the l*t
of next March, tnen the purchasers will
have to pay an assessment on it. This
would mean a percentage on at least $50,
--000 worth of goods, and the consignees
mean to avoid it if possible. Tne Swan
hilda, with b3OO ions aboard, docked yes
terday, but the chances are that noi a ton
will be taken out of her until her lay days
are up. The Bracadale has 2963 tons, the
Flintshire 1800 tonn and the Olivebank
4260, and not an ounce of the black dia
monds will have an owner until the iocal
authorities have made their assessments.
The battleship Oreeon changed her an
chorage yesterday. From Sau^aliio she
moved up to a safer position off Folsom
street wharf ana shortly afterward the
men were given liberty. Just how long
the war vessel will remain In port no one
seems to know, but just the same the fire
is kept going under the boiiers and steam
can be got up at a moment's notice.
The schooners Vine and Aida are still
keeping the water front guessing. The
former sailed from Corinto on September
12 last and should have been here long
ago, while the Aida is now outeighty days
from Shanghai for Port Townsend. The
chances are that unusually heavy weather
has been encountered and the subsequent
calnia that always follow in the tropics
have delayed both vessels and they may
arrive at their destination any day.
Yesterday's storm caused a great deal
of trouble on the bay. fhe ferry- boats
were all late and the river boats got the
whole of the heavy swell. The Monticelio
rolled. over until the passengers thought
she was going down and the Sunol and
Herald were both swept by the v. ayes that
broke aboard.
The new steamer Helene did not get
away from Pacitic-slreet wharf yesterday.
She has a very big cargo aboard, among
which is twenty-live mules and ten horses,
all of which are intended for the planta
tions on Ouhu. Captain Beckley is n<ore
than anxious to get away on the home
ward journey and expects to make the
trip in ten duys or less.
H. Johnson, head stevedore for the
Piper- Aden-Goiiall Company, has recov
eered from a severe attack of illness. He
was in the German Hospital for weeks,
but is now able to be out and about again,
and Al Pryor, the genial business man
ager of the concern, is more than pleased
in consequence.
The steam schooner Cleone got in from
Crescent City yesterday in one of the
squalls that swept ihe bay. Where she
went the Merchants' Exchange could not
find out, but the chances are that she is
at her dock in Mission Creek. The cap
tain reports that near Crescent City there
was a water-logged schooner (supposed to
be the Lottie Carson) adrift. The masts
had gone by the board, and po living soul
was on the vessel. Whether any lives
bad been lost or not could not be ascer
tained. Tne Lottie Carson was lumber
ladcn, and on her way to San Francisco.
MEYER MAY GET TIME.
The Groceryman's Assets Are
About Equal to His Lia
bilities.
A Committee of Creditors Now Work
ing on the Books ani Taking
Account of Stock.
The assignment of Emmanuel Meyer,
the wholesale anil retail grocery dealer,
w o for several years has conducted a
business in this City under the name of
Emmanuel Meyer <fc Co., was the occasion
of much comment, as he was commonly
reported to be doing a large business.
As a matter of fact he was, but he
carried a large amount on his books that
could not be collected on short notice and
a sudden call lor a large amount of money
caused bim to call hi? creditors together
and turn his assets over to them. A
strone factor in the matter is the fact that
a number of small dealers who were in
debted to Meyer have failed and their ac
counts are as good as lost,
A committee consisting of Daniel
Meyer, A. Vienier, J. H. Wheeler and J.
Caffaly is now at work on the Ftock and
books and will render a report at a meet
ing of the creditors which will be held on
Wednesday next.
Thus far the investigations of the com
mittee have been satisfactory, as the
stock has been found to be large and in
good condition, and many of the accounts
that were nt tiru thought to ba doubtful
will be realized on. The assets Ã¼bout
eq-:al the liabilities.
Mr. Meyer is said to have the confidence
of the majority of the creditors, and it is
within the range of possibility that the
business will be resumed as sopn as tbe
affairs of the house are straightened out.
A. Ruef, the auorney for Mr. Meyer, 0:1
whose advice the assignment was made,
said yesterday that lie had no doubt but
that all would be satisfactorily arranged
and that business would go on.

EXPERTS' OPINION
OF LITTLE VALUE
Ames and Carvalho Ruled
Against in the Abbott
Case.
A Decision by Judge Seawell
That Will Figure in Fair
Matters
Both Sides Confident of Victory in the
C)oney Perjury Case This
Morning.
The attorneys for Mrs. Craven in her
suit against the Fair estate on the pencil
deeds have found a peg on which to hang
a good deal of law in the decision of Judge
Seawell in the suit brought by Mrs. Nancy
A. Abbott to have herself declared the
wife of Capitalist Thomas M. Quacken
bush.
Airs. Abbott, in part, based her claim
upon a marriage contract, and although
the decision of the court was in favor of
the aged capitalist, it has a peculiar bear
ing on the pencil-deeds litigation, inas
much as Judge Seawell decided that the
testimony of experts that tfce marriage
contract had been forged was of no value.
It happens that the experts employed by
Quackenbush's attorneys were Ames and
Carvalho of New York, who were brought
here at a cost of $200 a day to examine the
pencil deeds under the microscope and
give an opinion on their genuineness. The
marriage contract under which Mrs. Ab
bott claimed to be Quuckenbush's wife
bears date of November 15, 1088.
At the time of the arrival of the famous
New York experts this document was sub
mitted to them by Attorney E. J. Pringle
lor examination. Ames and Carvalho
submitted the writing to the microscope,
and alterward made a chemical examina
tion of the ink and the paper. Their
opinion, which was rendered after their
return to New YorK in the way of a deposi
ition taken before a notary in QuacKen
bush's behalf, was that there had been
erasures and changes by the use of chem
icals in the handwriting in the document.
The paper, so tbe experts declared, had
been robbed by similar means of its
"mill" or finish in order to account for
the blurred appparnnce of the ink in many
of the letters. For Mrs. Abbott a member
of the firm of fc>. P. Taylor & Co. was put
on the stand to say that as the paper was
of a poor quality of book, it would have
been impossible to remove the "mill"
without destroying the fabric altogether.
This same witness also testified that Ink
on this brand of paper is sure to blur and
run.
Judge Seawell, while refusing Mrs. Ab
bott's claim on tbe ground that there had
been "no such assump'ion of the rights,
obligations and duties of husband and
wife as the statute requires" between her
self and QuacKenbusn, says that he be
lieved the marriage contract was signed
by the capitalist and that there were no
chemical erasures on it of previous writ
ing, as were declared to exist by Ames
and Carvalho. \
Judge Seawell's decision on this point is
likely to li-ve an important bearing in
Mrs. Craven's suit. Ames and Carvalho,
in addition to declaring the pencil deeds
forgeries, have sad that there are evi
dences in them of frequent chemical
erasures and retouching. The case of the
Fair administrators in a great measure
rests upon the opinion of these experts on
the documents.
The fate of James J. Cooney will be de
cided at 10 o'clock this morning, when
Magistrate Carroll Cook has promised to
render a decision in the lamous perjury
charge. The Fair people are confident
that the young notary will be held for
trial for the reason, they urge, that as a
committing magistrate Judge Cook is not
required to decide upon the guilt or inno
cence of Cooney, but simply if there was
probable cause for belitvine that he is
guilty of perjury. The notary's attorneys,
on the other hand, are equally confident
that tbe young man will be acquitted on
the same grounds.
.Famous Experts Arrive.
Among the arrivals here last night from
New York over the Central Pacific Rail
road were David U. Corvalho and Daniel
T. Ames, the widely known experts in
handwriting. They have been connected
with some of the most famous cases in the
country. In one of whichâ the celebrated
Morey letter forgery case â it is pointed
out that after they had testified to its gen
uineness it was proved to be otherwise.
The gentlemen came through the snow

IN THE FIELD OF SPORT.
General Snow Sprays the Pugilists â Coursing at
Ingieside â Rifle, Trap and Rod.
The beantifnl snow has blocked the
hopes of the pugilists who are training in
Nevada for the chanipionsbip battle. Cor
bttt says tbat as long as be can have a
chance to play handball he is satisfied,
and that General Snow can do all tbe
blowing he like*. As the weather condi
tions are not favoj*\b!e to line weather for
some days to come, and as tbe pugilists
bave only a limited time in which to
train, it is hoped that tbe storm king can
be induced to take a trip to Fiance.
Tbe wheelmen are in hope? of baying a
fine day on Monday, as on tnat day they
will compete on tne Velodrome track for
valuable prizes.
Tbe Interstate Coursing Club will hold
its annual meeting on Sunday and Mon
day at the Ingieside pa-k, and as the best

the coast will compete great racing is ex
pected.

An Interesting Programme for the
The road-racing committee of the Cali
fornia Associated Cycling Clubs, consist
ing of Charles Albert Adams, Olympic
Cub Wuee.men; thes.erri. Myrick, Re
liance 'Jlub Wn.elmen, and A. W. Weibe,
San Franci-co Road Club, definitely de
cided ye>terday a'ternoon :o postpone tbe
annual twenty-five mile road rÂ«ce of the
association for two weeks â until -Sunday,
March 7. as predicted in The Call yester
uay. The entries and handicaps as then
published will reru.tin unchanged, save
ior the addition of such other names aÂ«
are offered within tbe :iext week. The
Noonan brother* ot Santa Rosa bave en
tered, and one Wballey of Alacneda claims
bis entry was sent in and lost, so he will
a. so ssart. Thi* brings tbe liat up to an
even hundred starters.
Many did Dot recognize yesterday the
entry, "A. vV. (.leaver. Reliance, scratch.' 1
and wondered who this man could be
whom they had never heard of and yet
who was put on scratch. Mr. Cleaver
hails from Chicago, though more latterly
from Los Angeles. He h::s been a mem
ber ot the Bay City W;ieeimen for some
years past, anl recently joined the Re
liance Club. There is some doubt, how
ever, if he win start.
There wiii be a hustling for the Olympic
trophy, which tne Acme Cub ha? car>
tureu twice and stands a good chance of
winnine for good thin tune.
Tue prize list will be particularly inter
esting to the riders, and is given here
with. There are four elegant time prize-,
to wit: Gold split-second watch, god
chain anil locket, suit ol clothes, traveling
grip. There are twenty-live place prizes,
winch are civen in relation to their value
and position on the list as follows: Gold
watcii, diamond locket, overcoat, silver
chronometer, opal and diamond scar'pin,
bicycle suit, pair of trousers, camera, com- '
bination umorella and cane, one dozen
Paris pnnels, racing su ; t, Palmer tire-,
Morgan & \Vrignt tires, Vim tires, shav
ing set, racing suit, chronograph, kodak,
fishing rod, hat, racing shoes, bicycle
lamp, Record pedals, Leon cyclometer,
silver key rintr.
This comprises a list more valuable than
any ever offered by the association, which
probably accounts lor the increased entry
list and lively interest in tl>e race.
R. M. Welch, one of California's dele
gates to the recent League of American
Wheelmen's convention at Albany, N. V.,
is exacted to arrive here to-morrow night
at 8:45 o'clock on his return. He is ac
companied by ranK W. Fuller of the
Olympic Club Wheelmen. Frank H. Ker
rigan, chief consul of the leaeue in this
Slate, who was also a delegate, ha- re
mained in the East to visit some rela
tives, and will not get back here until tno
first week in Marcn. It is expected he
will come with Bald, Cooper and the
racing aggregation, which contemplates
training on the coast this spring, ,'tr .-
E. E. Stoddard will leave for an ex
tended trip through Oregon and Wash
ington this evening.
It is the opinion of such riders and
trainers as Young, Shaier, Windle, Bald,
Murphy, Butler, Starbuck and Goodman,
that the coming cycle racing season will
eclipse anything ever -een in this coun
try. They say that every indication points
to increased interest in racing matters.
They argue that many patrons of baseball,
horse-racing and kindred- sports will be
found at the cycle tracks this year.
Captain Day i.ad called a club ran of
the Bay City Wheelmen to San Leandro
for Monday, but as the big road-race has
been' postponed the ran is also off. The
club has thirteen men entered, and as
thirteen has always been its lucky number
much is expected of them.
Larger gears will be the rule the coming
reason in cycle racing. It i< said that
BaM will use an &4-gear, and that th;s
move will be followed by all the prom>

the man to push such a gear, with his im

The North California Division, League
of American Wheelmen, gained sixteen
new members during the past week. In
spite of all the talk about secessiou, new
r cruits continue to com* in.
A week from to-morrow the Imperial
Cycling Club will bold the first road race
of the season from Fruitvale to Jaay ward?,
a ten-mile event, for members only. A
number of riders are in training for it,
and if the roads are good fast time should
be made.
A. G. Batchelder, the New York State
handicappper, will probably be one of the
New York newspaper men at the Corbett-
Fitzsinirnons light, lie will go from there
to this State and will stay until the open-
Ing of the circuit. As a handidpper
Batchelder is m.d to be second only to
our own "Boboy"' Smyth.

the entry list. Considering that these
men are only fifty rni.es away, in training

The racing men are taking a great deal
of interest in the opening of the big State

special round-trip rate bus been arranged
and a large delegation of San Francisco
wheelmen will attend. There will be four
professional and two amateur events and
a number of record tr.ais, and the class of

There will be lots of entries, plenty of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, &ATURDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1897.
"Prince" Albert Lucas, who at one time
gained great notoriety while on the detective
force at Portland, Or., but having been forced
to seek retirement on occount of his physical
condition, and being a sportsman of no little
ability, he returned to the land oj his birth,
where he was always considered a crack shot
and a skillful man with the rod and gig. On
the Bth inst. he accomplished the grand feat
wnlcn has so suddenly made him very promi
nent in fish and gamu circles, and entitles
Mm to claim the championship of capturing
salmon out of small creeks with an instru
ment commonly known as a "gig." He suc
ceeded in the short space of half an hour in
capturing forty-five salmon out of a very
rough and rocky stream, generally known as
Candle Creek, which is regarded as something
more than remarkable, as very lew persons
were ever known to have gigged more than
twenty salmon in the same length of time,
and more especially during the winter season,
when the waters in all these streams are very
hieh and swift. |
A short sketch of the life of Prince Albert is
as follows: "Prince" was born in the year
1855. about three miles from Ukiah City, on
the North Fork of Robinson Creek. His boy
hood days were spent down on the farm and
in his e*r:y life he occupied a large part of
his time in hunting for wild animals such as
pnnther, bear ana mountain lions, with
whom he had many desperate encounters and
his escnpc on many occasions was miraculous.
In his younger days he was even then consid
ered the best fisherman in the county. At the
age of 25 he went to Portland and found em
ployment on the detective force and by his
great cunning, shrewdness and cleverness he
gradually worked himself up to one of the
bent positions on the force, but owing to the
condition of the climate not being suitable to
his heal in, he was compelled to leave Portland
and moved to VncaviUe, where he was also
emp oyed on the local police force as a' private
detective, but Hi* health not improving any
be returned some four years ago to his native
home ami has resided here since that time.
While out on a hunting expedition last sum
mer with a party of lrlends near Trinity
County, he nearly met his fate at tho hands of
a mountain lion. One day while out roiling
leisurely along and watching for a good
chhnee to kill some bucks, he accidentally
charged into a mountain lion's den. This lion
had done considerable damage to all the
farmers and stockraisers in the vicinity of the
boundary line between Trinity and Meudocino
counties in killing their stock, and Prince
never thought *>r a moment oi coming in con
tact with this ferocious beast. However, be
Immediately grasped the situation, and vividly
recalling to mind the great feats of his younger
days, he waited his opportunity, and when the
lion in. .de its leap, ha plunged ins knife into
its heart and killed the beast on the spot.
For this brave? act Prince received many hand
some tribute*, and his invitations every sum
mer to return to these hunting grounds are
very numerous.
He again displayed his courage and bravery
last Christmas day whi>e on duty as a special
officer in attempting to arrest a half breed
uaui d Domingo Parker. I'arker struck at
Prince witu a dagger, but it fortunately missed
its mark, and he only received a slight wound
on the 'eft arm, and he *trugg'>ed with his
man until he overpowered him. Since that
time he has positively retused 10 do any police
or detective work of any nature, and has de
voted his atleutieu entirely to fishing. His
jertormance lust Saturday excelled anything
ever heard of in this part of me country, and
Ins supporters are very jubi.auorer his guc
c s<, and are willing to back him for any
amount in this line of fishing. He is still im
proving, and he expects to surprise his lriends
uy doubling tue last catch, and ills hoped his
efforts will prove successful.

is the perfect and unique code of signals

are dividing the time so that there is no

THE OARSMEN.
The Dolphins' New Boathousa Is
Finished.
Despite the fact that it rained Sunday
morning the Dolphins built a new walk to
the boathouse under the supervision of
Ed Sullivan and Tommy Kennedy.
In the afternoon Â« crew, composed of T.
J. Kennedy, T. R. Keenan, T. J. Sullivan
and C. M. Farrell, under the watchful eye
of A Jam Schuppert, rowed to Sausalito,
and on their return Captain Patch took
out the barge with R. J. Blen-ierhassett,
John Lynch, Alex Pape and Sam Murray
as tar as Fort Point wharf.
The Dolphins have never made a good
record with their crews, owing to the
rough waier in tho vicinity of their quar
ters; but now that the new l>oathouse is
finished, and sleeping quarters have been
put in, Captain Pitch feels continent that
the blue and white will be seen in front
more than once this year.
Adam Schuppert will assist Patch in
training and coaching the men. Schup
pert is an old-time oarsman that rowed in
the early 'B)'s, und has seven first prizes
to show for his skill, both in single and
fours.
ThÂ» club will hold a try-out the second
Sunday in Marcn, and James Lali> will
then row via match race with Fred Woer

On Monday the h-atarp of the tourna

from the present appearance of the
weather the event will prove remarkably
successful. The contest will be for the F.

The Lincoln Gun Club has arranged a
very neat programme, wnich states that

third Sundays of each month, commenc
ing in Maich an i ending in August.
Smoke will be seen during the days when
war will be declared on blnerocks at the

The Denver Rifle Club, the members of
which have always been aggressive in tbe
matter of game protection in Colorado,
unanimously voted, at the recent annual
meeting, against the proposed hunters'
license. The resolution said, in part:
"We believe such a Jaw would deter sports
men and tourists from visiting our moun
tain reports during tha open season for
the purpose of huntin â  and fishing; that
the game and fish <->f the State being pup
lic property, we believe in equality for all
and special privileges to none during such
seasons when the game and fish may be
taken ; that, as we believe the general pub
lic derives benefit lrom the game and fish
in our public domain, therefore the reve
nue necessary to pronerly protect the fish
and game should be den ved from the State
funds."
Senator Hall's amendment to the game
laws, the intent of which ia to permit
hunters to kill canvasback and bluebill
uucks at all months of the year, is about
the most nonsensical measure that has
ever been introduced in tne Legislature,
and deserves to be snot to pieces.
Although the season may be lengthened
a month, it would nevcrdo togive market
huuters an opportunity of slaughtering
birds during the breeding season, which
they certainly would do if Hall's amend
ment became a law. The hunters could
very easily strip the mallards and other
kinds of ducks which breed here of their
feathers and ship them to this City under
the name of canvasbnek or bluebill.
Several amendments to the game bill
have passed the secjnd reading in the
Senate. In brief, the alterations in the
present law are as follows: The season for
mnrkÂ»tinp all game is from October 15 to
February 15, instead of from November 15
to January 15; the season for shooting
mountain quail and grouse to open on
September 1 in place of August 15: oneu
season on doves to commence Juif 15 in
place of July 1. Hall's amendment to the
open season for ducks excepts oanvasback
and blueb.ll; in otner words, these varie
ties of clucks are not protected at all and
can be shot and marketed at any time.
The Fixh and Game Commission are
opposed to Hall's amendment, as are the
sportsmen of this City. Chief Depuiy Bab
cock says that such a law would render
the entire duck law inoperative. The
hunter* wi'l kill all kinds of ducks at all
seasons, pick them and cut off their heads
and feet and sell them for canvasl acks
and bmebills, and not one in a thousand
could teil the differenre. Mallards would
be killed while nesting, and our supply oi
home-ored duck reduced to noihing. This
may be amended before the third reading,
but if not, the sportsmen will endeavor to
kill the whole bill.
THE KENNEL.
Classes That Will B9 Judg-ed In
Stockton by Mason and Fellows.
Next Wednesday the American Kennel
Club will decide whether the newly born
San Francisco Kennel Club or the Olym
pic Gun Club will give a show in this City
this year.
Both clubÂ» have applied for dates, but
as the Olympic Gun Club was first in the
field it 16 certainly entitled to the prefer
ence.
Judging from a letter that was recently
received by a lecal sportsman from a
prominent dog-fancier of New York, tne
result that will, in all probability, accrue
from the meeting of the parent club, will
not prove satisfactory to the Olympic Gun
Club.
The letter states that high pressure has
been brought to bear unon prominent in
dividuals of the American Kennel Club
by some California dog-fanciers with the
object of bavins the settlement of the
question given to the Pacific Advisory
Board, whicn board is under the influence
of ono man, who is said to have been the
prime originator of the so-called San
Francisco Kennel Club.
It will bÂ« a very agreeable surprise to
the Olympic Gun Club if the A.-uerican
Kennel Club siiould decide in it-> favor.
Certainly ii the officers ot the American
Kennel Club thoroughly understood the
s tuation here and would be influenced by
a majority vote of the sportsmen and do*
men of this City and coast, then the
Olympic Gun Club would win the day
wi:h flvnc colors.

THE RING.
Who W!!l Win the Big Fight Is a Ques
tion Now Asked by Thousands.
Dan Stuart and Referee Siler are sick in
Carson. They attribute their misfortune
to the fact that tljey were not copyrighted
in time to escape from ihe beautiful snow.
It is io be hoped, i.owever, that the great
promoter and the man who has been se
lected to pass judgment on the champion
ship mill will toon bo up and dotner.
Stuurt cannot afford to remain in bed
for any ien.th of time as be i,a- business
of the utmost importance to attend to on
the outside.
A few months ago be was taken sick in
Texas with inflammation of the bowels,
and had no easy time pulling through.
He will exercise particular care now to
avoid a relapse. The change in climate
has put Siler on his back, but he will be
on his pins in Â» few days.
Corbeit is feoliug in tip-top shape ac
cording to the reports ot special corre
spondents, and if nothing unforeseen will
happen that may alter his plans between
now and March 17, he should appear in
the ring fit to make the battle of his life.
Fitzsimmons is sawing wood some
where on the road. He has very little to
say about tne match and what his chances
will le of debating Champion Jim; but
occasionally when he is pressed for a
word he reminds his questioners that
there will be two horses in thr race and
that the horse which makes the greatest
clatter does not always come in ahead.
Fitz will soon be stationed at bis training
quarters near Carson, and wnen he once
gets properly into the hardness then the
readers of pugilistic affairs can expect to
hear something spicy from Robert the
great concerning his chances of defeating
Corbett and winning "a barrel" of money.
Allowing that the two men will be
physically in good con lition on the day
.-elected for the settlement of the cham
pionship dispute, i' is cenerally conceded
that Corbett is superior to Fitzsimmons in
cleverness and ability to avoid punish
ment; but the fact cannot be denied,
nevertheless, that the Cornishman has a
very happy knack of landing his big fist
on come vulnerable spot when his oppo
nent Is least expecting a warm reception.
It is no wonder then thai Fitzsimmons
is looked upon by the fraternity as beinn
a most Dangerous man, and possibly
there is not a pugilist in tne business who
realizes that fact better ;han Corbett.
If the latter can go the pace for any
reasonable distance witnout tiring he
should win, as he will cut out a gallop for
Fitz that will astonish the Cornishman.
But Robert i-< cunning ana chock full of
funny oid tricks, which he has played
wah tho greatest success on men who
shouted before they got out of the wood,
believing that they had the elongated
blacksmith cooked to a turn.
Fitz->irninons will have an advantage
over Corbett in reach, as his arms, when
extended, cover by two inches more terri
tory tnan the champion's. He strikes a
terrible blow, also, and if he should hap
pen to land on Corbett, either in a rally or
at long ranee, the chances are two to one
that the Californian will go sprawling on
the boards.
The question asked by thousands is:
Can Corbett avoid being hit on the chin
or jugular during the heat of battle.
when both men are fresh and full of
ginger?
Some say that Fitz will land beyond a
doubt, and that Corbett cannot recover
from the blow; but the Corbett people
contend that Fitz will be hitting atempty
spaoe, and when "rattled" he will receive
a coup eof clips under the ear that will
bring the big figut to a speedy conclu
sion.
Every man has his opinion, but all bet
tors cannot cash checks when the pool
sellers are ready to pay out the long green
to the winners. It is hoped, however,
that the contest will not be won on a foul
blow. It may answer some, but the great
majority will enter a strong objection.
Jeffries, thÂ« Loi Antrc ea heavy-weight,
will leave for Carson on Monday. He says
that the next time he emerainto an agree
ment with a club to tight he will insist
upon having some security in case the
match is declared off.

â¢ It Was All About Three Feet of
Frontage in Disputeâlnjunc
tions Issued.
A dispute over three feet of frontage
yesterday suggested a revival of early day
â¢scenes in San Francisco, when land claims
were settled by tbe shotgun ana bludgeon.
: Ju?t- around the northern corner of
"Montgomery avenue and I'uponl street I.
MerJe is the owner of 17:6 feet frontage,
' with a depth of 62:6 feet. Adjoining this
lot on the north is a nece of property
.' owned by V. Becca, with a frontage of 40
feet, witii an equal depth to that of
Merle's.
The odd three feet of land on Merle's
Hot have beea a bone of contention be
'jMtetn those two neighbors for year?, but
4 ;:iuc"h as both had houses built on
' â  .ots nothing was done to settle this
dispute in a court of equity until yester
day, when per force the machinery of the
jaw was set in motion.
This action, however, had been precipi
. by a scene enacted at an early hour
m the morning by two armed bodies of
figating men coming together.
This scene was brought about by Merle
tearing down the old shanty which stood
on the lot preparatory to putting up a
better building. As soon as the walls of
th.s building had been removed Bocca
conceived the idea of takinâ¢ possession of
what he claimed were his three feet of
property. In order to do so he bored sev
erai holes in tbe dividing wall and ran
heavy timbers through from his side out
in.:o the vacant lot of Merle. Upon those
limbers he placed studding, fastening the
same to the side of his house at a higher
elevation. Having done this during the
: time he placed three trusty vatcn
. in cuarge with instructions to hold
the fort at all hazards.
This coup d'etat was communicated to
Merle, who at once sought the advice of
his lawyer, A. Kuef, who instructed him
to remove any and ali obstructions from
his side of the Borca wall. This was ad
vice easier to give than to execute, as both
. the owner and the lawyer fouud out when
they brought their workmen to tbe scene.
The presence of three determined men was
anything but inviting to a man who had
no interest in real estate disputes.
Thus Bocca succ eded for the present in
holding his antagonist at bay, but his vic
tory was of brief duration, for yesterday
rooming at 4 o'clock, in a pelting rain
storm, Ã¼bout twenty men whoso names or
residences were not given to the pub.ic ap
peared on the scene w;th crosscut saws,
and something cisc under
Their coats similar to wnat the police find
in their raids in Chinatown when the
highbinder? are out on one of their festi
val trips.
k The appearance of this bneade was too
" much for Bocca's watchmen, and as a
wise precaution they went in out of the
rain whiie the studding and timbers were
beinir removed. In the meantime Attor
ney Ruef had pavers prepared, and at 10
o'clock Judge Seawell issued injunctions
against all parties until such time as tne
dispute over the property is settled in
court;
The Sheriff lost no time in serving the
papers on Bocca, after which Merle with
drew his force and quiet has been tem
porarily restored.

SUPERVISORS MAY
MARCH TO JAIL
Climax Is at Hand on the
Issue of Meals for
Jurors.
Judge Cook Â£ends in Bills
Which, Â£o Far, Fail to
Be Approved.
Attorney Creswell Draws a Fearsome
Picture of Courts and Yawn-
ing Dungeons.
Judge Carroll Cook of the Superior Court
has sent in three bills for meals furnished
jurors in criminal cases for the City and
County to pay. Judge Cook notiiied the
Supervisors two or three weeks ago that
he would take this course. That there
might be no mistake about, the matter, he
communicated his intention in a type
written document. Oa the other ! and,
the Board of Supervisors have adopted a
resolution not to pay any bills for jurors'
meals after February 1, 1897.
The bill-* sent in by Judge Cook number
three. Each one is for $12, the price of
one meal for twelve men of good appeiites
and keen appreciation of the good things
of life. They are dated respectively Feb
ruary 4, 5 and 12, and represent the hunper
of the juries in People against Tully,
People against Lyons an.l People against
Reynolds. They are all made out in
favor of P. J. Tecnau & Co. The bilia set
forth that the Deputy Sheriff also dined
in each case.
Yesterday afternoon Supervisor Smith,
chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
and Supervisor Lackmann had these bills
called to their notice as they sat in the
committee- room.
"I'll not approve them," said Super
visor Smith. "I will give you that
straight. Tne board has voted not to ap
prove any of these bills after February 1,
and I, for one, intend to adhere to that
programme. The jury fund 13 depleted
and will be fihausted before the end of
the liscal year. It is necessary to econo
mize. The board voted to economize in
this matter, and I had hoped that the
courts would appreciate the position."
Clerk Russell made no remark, but
automatically bundled the bills bacK into
a tin box.
Just then City and County Attorney
Creswell came in. He beard what was
going on and made some suggestions
which seemed to bring up vividly to mind
dungeon cells, prison walls, prison fare
and other conditions wacu would be un
congenial to Supervisors of tnis City and
County. He said that the Penal Code pro
vides for the meals of jurors in criminal
cases; that the C.vil Code, while provid
ing for the compensation per diem of
jurors, does not in terms conflict with the
Penal Code.
"Suppose," he said, -while a erira smile
giayed over his features, "the court shall
send down an order for the paymÂ«>ni of
these bills and that a refusal shall be fol
lowed by the visits ol" deputy sheriffs,
and arrests, and prosecutions for con
tempt of court, and imprisonment? "
Supervisor Smith did not seem to be ap
palled by tins possible contingeucy. On
the contrary, he stood to his guns.
"I will not sign the bills," he jaid.
Supervisor Lackmann smiled benignly
and smiled more whe l a suggestion was
made that when jurors are called hereafter
they shall be requested to bring their lunch
in s tin dinner pail with a tin cup on top
from which they may drink their coffee.
City and County Attorney Creswell
shared in the general glee.
"You know, of course, that this might
be made continuous contempt," tie said,
"and you might remain in dungeons for a
long time."
"Seems to me,"' broke in Supervisor
Lackmann. "that jurors feed well. They
seem to have a uniform price of $1 per
meal, which is a little odd. Now,' he
added facetiously, "I would agree to sup
ply them witu crackers and cheese at a
less pi ice."
The Judiciary Committee did not ap
prove the bills; neither did they instruct
Cierk Russell to write to the Superior
Judge to say that they would not pay
them. They just washed thiir hands of
the whole matter by voting to refer the
bills from Judge Cook's court, along with
some others from Judge Campbell's court,
to the Finance Committee, of which
Supervisor Kottanzi is the chairman. Pos
sibly thai committee will refer the matter
to tne committee of the whole, when the
entire board can hayÂ» the choice of either
braving dungeons vile or rescinding the
resolution which was calculated to let
jurors go hungry or pay for their own
sustenance.

MRS. ABBOTT LOSES.
Judge Sea well Says She Wai Not Mar
ried to Thomas 31 Quackenbuih.
Judge Seawell of the Superior Court has
decided against Mrs. Nancy A. Abbott in
her suit against Thomas M. Quackenbuih
for $.500 a month permanent alimony on
the ground that she was married to
Quackenbush by contract. She also de
manded that an order be made canceling
certain deeds which be recently executed,
pretending to transfer his $750,000 worth
of real estate to his daughter, Mrs. Esther
Swortgeur. Mrs. Abbott claims a wife's
â¢bare of that property,
After hearing all the testimony and ar
gument* by the attorneys Judge Seawell
said that though he did not question the
genuineness of the to-called marriage con
tract, yet under the law he believed there
was never any marriage, as Mrs. Abbott
and Mr. Quackenbush had never assumed
, thole marital duties ana relationships

Weeks.
Vrettos, Formerly of the Greek

They Are Now Three Hundred aad
Will Bj Three Thousand Eefare
They Arrive.
Three hundred sturdy and patriotic
Greeks, beaded by P. Vrettos of this City,
will leave for the scene of hostilities in
Crete in the course of tbe next three
weeks. They will stop en route at the
larger cities, and are confident that their
numbers will be increased to something
like 3000 by the lime they reach Is'ew
York.
The Greek Consul in that city has beer.
| communicated with and will, it i 3 under
â  stood, furnish the necessary transporta
tion expenses. The company will pro
ceed from New YorK to Havre, thence to
Paris, Marseilles and Athens, the Grecian
capital.
Mr. Vrettoj, as previously stated in
theso column?, formerly served in the
Grecian army. He attained the rank of
sergeant during Ihc trouble with Turkey
over the attempt on the part of the GreeK
Government to beize certain- territory in
Epirus in 1880.
He was stationed with his reciment at
Profithiilias. in Thessaiy, ?ome five miles
from Mount Olympus, and while there
participated in more than one exciting
brush with the enemy, in one of winch he
received two bullet wounds in the right
leg.
"1 didn't think much of the Turk as a
soldier, ' said Mr. Vreitot last night. "I
remember an incident during the cam
paign 1 speak of wnicb confirmed me in
that opinion. Major Lorn* was killed at
Contra, about (en miles from Proliihillia?,
and the command devolved upon a man
named Yataganas, who, witti no more
than three corporals and twenty-two pri
vates behind h;m, charged and routed 300
Turks, slaying 10J of that number."
Mr. Vrettos has lived nine years in
America, though the remaining members
of his family reside in the mother coun
try. He was careful to add that neither
ho nor his companions have any inten
tion of permanently abandoning the
United States. 'If alive when the tan is
' all over," said Mr. Vrettos ingeniously,
"we will return to California."
MRS. BLATTNEE'S TENANT.
Summary Method* Adopted to i jcot
1 nprofltable Occupant*
Mary M. UJpttner, who owns the flat! at
232 Natoma street, has just got rid of
some objectionaole tenants by a self-act
ing process of ejection.
A man named Donovan rented one of
the flats for another tenant, who did not
pay up and who would not move out.
Mrs. Blattner's agent waited until he
lound the tenant away, and then with
some carpenters he removed and caned
away every door ami window in the house.
In this case the hint was equal to ihÂ»
occasion, !hat a removal would be accept
able to Properly -owner Uiattner, and by
the way of accommodating that individual
the Cerf household goods followed in the
wake of the wagon with the doors and
windows.
When the tenants returned the houie
was uninhabitable, and the household
eoods were at once removed to more con
gen ml quarters.

"FREE CUBA" IS
THE POPULAR CRY
New Friends Join the
Lccal League Each
Day.
Mayo:' Phelan Expresses His
Sympathy With the
Movement.
Many People Write Letters and the
Committee Plans for a Public
Meeting
There were many callers at the Cnban
headquarders yesterday, and Secretary
Mascherini was busy explaining to them
the progress of the local movement.
"Wo shall be obliged to issue some
definite circulars on the subject," he said
last night, "for it requires too muc 1 time
to explain to peop.e just what we mean.
There ia scarcely a day passe 3 i at we do
not get offers of men to go on the fields of
battle, but that is not what we want. The
Cubans cannot be aided in violation of
international laws and treaties."
Each of the fifty-eight committeemen
selected by the league to co-operate with
Colonel Ethan Allen and Charles A. Dana
of New York yesterday received a letter
from ihe Mayor of San Francisco notify
ing him of his appointment. The loilow-
Ine is a copy of the letter sent by the
Mayor to the committeemen:
Pear Sir: Pursuant to a request nf the Cnban
League of the United Slates I have appointed
you to net as one of a committee 01 fifty to
organize a branca of the bald league In this
City. The object of tne Cuban League is to
enlist ihe sympathies of our citizens in be
half of the Cutai.s in their struggle for inde
pendence. I believe it to be our duty to
assist the Cuban patriots and trust you may
find it possible to g.ve the movement your
earnest support. Very truly yours.
James D. Phelan, Mayor.
James W. Orndorff is one of the best
known members of the committee, which
is in every particular a representative
body. By reason of his wide acquaint
ance with frontiersmen and pioneers he is
in a position to know the feeling on the
Cuban question in a definite way. Speak
ing of the subject yesterday he said :
"There is a wonder.'ul sentiment in
favor of the strugglers who are battling
for freedom against Spanish brutality.
Were this Government to taKe a hand in
the matter it would be easy to revive the
old light lor liberty. I do not think the
Government ought to meddle in the mat
ter, but we ought to give Cuba our moral
support. '
The following is a sample of the letters
tbr.t come to the committee daily:
102 N. Fourth Street, San Jose, >
Feb. 17, IM)7. )
Messrs. Jones and JTascheriniâ . rak Sirs: To
you and your fellows in Cuba's cause tut free
dom! 1 most ie>l you that my heart leaps
with joy to learn that in San Francisco bo
many noble, unselfish hearts beat In sympa
thy for their struggling brothers on Cuba's
Isle. I say God speed your endeavors to gain
and safely convey to them the aid they sorely
need to speedily drive i heir foe Deyond their
gates. la my. youth ill Pnterson, X. J., I knew
many of the sons of wealthy planters of Cuba
who married into our best familiesâ married
New Jersey's patriotic, blue-eyed girls, and
man of our blue-eyed sons and brothers went
to Cub* and wed Us dark-eyed maids. â _
May the freedom-loving children in Uncle
Sam's domain remember the time when their
sires were in need of aid to gain the freedom
we now enjoy. God bless you.
Mrs. a. Asberry.
The developments of the past two weeks
have shown that there is perhaps a
warmer feeling for Cuba in this City and
on the Pacific Coast than anywhere in the
Union.
UNIQUE ART EXHIBITION.

Illustrated.
It is a novel exhibition that has just
been opened at 22)4 Geary street by
Wilder & Co. Tastefully arranged on the
walls of their offices are hundreds of
advertising sketches and posters, includ
ing everything from the simple and time
honored wood cut to the elaborate and ef
fective affairs in black and white that
have marKed the end of the century meth
ods.
The process of making an advertise
ment, is shown in its various stages, as
well as the various changes and trans
formations it undergoes' from the ticne it
leaves the bauds of the artist until it ap
pears before the reader, either in the
newspaper or magazine.
The exhibition has proved a powerful
attraction. In addition to scores of busi
ness men and merchants, classes irom the
Mark Hopkins Scnoot ol Art were among
ihe many visi;ors yest-rday.
Advertisement making and writing is
rapidiy developing into a diÂ«tinct profes

making, as well as the unique methods
and devices emoloyed by business men to
attract the public eye to their wares.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
SEW YORK.. N. V., Feb.l9.-The stock mar
ket was duller than evt r tc-day, the transactions,
106,123 shares, reaching tbe smallest total for any
day this week. The business was almost entirely
for professional account. In the early trading the
tendency of prices was downward, owing to the
receipt of lower quotations from London, where
securities were depressed by warlike news from
Crete. The foreigners were sellers of International
stocks in tn:s market and this encouraged the bear
dealers, lhe continued heaviness of toe coal
stock* also exercised Â»n adverse influence witn
the Grangers, which were lower for a time on un
founded rumors that the Burlington and Quincy
dividend would be reduced. The gr ales decline
was in New jersey Central, which yielded 2 points
10 953/. Theoth.-r losses were l/s to % per cent.
Wiion It became known that the directors of the
Burlington had decided on the usual quarterly
dividend of 1 per cent a decided change in the
temper of speculation took place. The buying was
confined chiefly to the shorts, but nevertheless
prices recovered ygtol^i per cent all along the
line. Leaiher preierred. Jersey Central and Lack
awanua led the upward movement. Luke shore
was exceptionally buoyant, rising 3s /a. The ad
vance brought out comparatively little stock, as

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Ir.i,. Feb 19 âWheat this morning j
acted with the same firmness which was an
attribute early in the week, sentiment continued
to overshadow other considerations. Advices from
Liverrool did not convey any particular encour
agement, they being but 141 higher than yester
day, and therefore not sufficiently strong to re !
fleet fully our advance of yesterday. Receipts in
the Northwest were fair at 235 cars against 256 a i
year Â«go. Chicago received 21 cars and inspected
out 66, 1 40 bushels English consols were steady, I
j itdicaiing no uneasiness IB that country regard- i
ins: the out' ome of the present Grecian trouble.
Closing Continental cables were higher, Export
clearances were liberal at 423.976 bushels. The
market maintained its firm tone throughout, at
taining the highest figures of the day near the
cic se, the buying being induced by the export
clearances and by a reported artillery engagement
between Turks and Grecians. May wheat opened
from 75l B clu7J'/g.-, advanced to 7b l a c, closing
at 76Vi(fl<"t>3/ g c, X higher than yesterday. Esti- I

<-'AT Sâ The strength of wheat and corn impart
ed firmness to oats aid encouraged some buying.
The business was moderate, no interest attaching I
to it. Receipts were 290 cars, and 48 707 bushel*
were taken from store. -Exports were 40,677

Woo:.- 1 he circular of Jacob Wollner says:
â¢â 1 be local market hÂ»s been rÂ»ti.er qule. with Hie
exception that uioat of the IOCS] woolen-mills were
in the market and took consul.' nblu Wool, one
mill in particular having taken 400,001) &>< 111 the
last lv days. This Wool Is not for immediate use
but to be laid up for nit in une .v. the manufactur
ers East are doing. Prices are well malutaned.
The scourlnir-mllls lave plenty slock to run on
with, and with he exieption Of on- mill all are
running steadily. The Mock of Wool on hand in
this market amounts to about hOO-i bales in the
grease, consisting 01 Ore. on, Nevada and th beat
grades of California Fall, and there arc al-o about
250U bales scoured Wool of all kinds In the mar
ket 1 in- interior. with the exception of Los A
ngeles, is prettjr well cleaned up. Eastern martteis
report some tailing off In sales with manufacturers
in the market fur the, raw material, and notwith
standing the firmer to:. of the market the Miles
too. up large in comparison with 189<i baalnesa
The sales for the pÂ«st week In the three principal
li arKeis, Boston. New York and Philadelphia, will
show nearly 9,0U0,000 lbs. The business since me
first of the year, which is by all odd* the larseat
reported for seven successive weeks In the history
of the Wool trade for buylne. Is beluir done en
tirely because of the expectation of a tariff being
put on Woo, and manufacturers an anxious to
have tome On band al that time, as the demand
lor manufactured BOOds does not justify such large
buying or even such prices as have been paid.
Woo. are being rushed In trom ail parts 01 the
world to the United States. At tbe London sales
which will reopen the nth of Mar. b, there will be
a good catalogue of the choicest Wools offered, and
11 is expected that the American buyers w li cut
quite a figure, as they did in the last -.cries. Every
Australian steamer has a good deal or Wool for
American account, the .National Wool-growers'
Association and the National Wool Manufactur
ers' AUOciatlOO, which held a session la.st week in
Washington, couM not agree on a tariff on the raw
material. The Wool Mnnutaciuring Association
wanted to concede 9c fl Ib duty on the best grades
of Wool, but the \v'oo;-Krowers' Association want
el a duty as proposed In- Mr. Lawrence of 12c for
1897, 13c tor lb9H, 14c f0r1899 aDd 15c for 1900."

COALâ A local circular .says: "There have been
six arrivals this week from the Coast collieries
with 15,896 tons of Coal and we are again without
a car^o of foreign Coal coming to band. A new
collier has been added to our list, the Norwegian
steamer Florida just arrived with 5300 tons from
Cotnox. This is the largest cargo of Coast Coal
ever coming nere. As most of our re ular Coal
carriers (sailing vessels) have been ordered off the
ii a t, carrying lumber to foreign ports, and some
of our steam colliers have been disabled, shippers
are li ding tonnage growing scarcer. There will
be an active demand lor all Coast Coals for three
months to come, a* less than 12.C00 ton* of foreign
Co.il can reach here in the next 45 dais If mere
was any unity existing between our northern col
liery managers they could at this moment make
their power acutely felt in the fuel market: it is
well for consumers it is us it Is. A l. other shipment
of British Columbia coke Is at hand, an) is a
marked improvement on all prior arrivals, as It is
no"v belnz >(jiieil 10 meet the exact requlr men;s
of our local consumers. This will lead to dimin
ishing shipments of fcingllsh and Belgian later on."

Three l.mls tiÂ» a Rope.
An Irishman who was out of work went
on board a vessel that was in the harbor
and asked the captain if he could find him
work on the ship.
"Well," said the captain, at the same
time handing the Irishman a piece of rope,
"if you can find three ends to that rope
you shall have some work.''
The Irishman then got hold of one end
of the rope, and, showing it to the captain,
said:
"That's one end, your Honor."
Then he took hold of the otuer end and,
showing it to the captain as before, said:
"And that's two ends, your Honor."
Then taking hold of both ends of the
rope he threw it overboard, saying:
"And, faith, there's an end to the rope,
your Honor."
He was engaged. âSpare Moments.

TAKES POISON
Mrs. Annie Baker's Life
Saved Only Because of
Timely Help.
Despondent on Account of Sep
aration From Husband and
Two Children.
Since a Fruitless Search in Mexico
.the Sorrowfu. Woman Has B en
Despondent
Oakland Office Sax Frasctsco Call,
90S Broadway, Feb. 19. )
But for the timely arrival of a doctor
Mrs." Annie Baker would undoubtedly
have died this morning. Mrs. Baker
lives on Webster street and swallowed a
large dose of carbolic acid, and owing to
â¢ the fact that she ha* been very despondent
of late, her friends believe that she in
tended to end her life.
Â° During the past few weeks she has fre
quently slated that such was her desire.
Mrs. linker has a pitiful history. Four
w,srs ago her home was one of the hap
-JT t.in Oakland. She was the wife of a
â¢\a3chinist, and their family consisted of
ir.erhselve? and two little children. They
lived 'in North Oakland, and the mother
tfus a graduate from the public schools,
where she distinguished herself by her
high standing in every subject she under
took 10 study.
. .Mrs. Baker married early in life, but
everything was harmonious in their fam
â iiy till she was suddenly deserted by her
huoband. He left her and the children
â¢without saying where he was gointr, but
was later discovered in Mexico. He went
soinh with the husband of a companion
of Mrs. Baker's, and alter the little chil
"tfren had been sent to their grandmother
"me two women undertook to go to Mexico
and try to induce their husbands to re
turn. Their journey south was full of
adventure, but. they did not accomplish
â¢be purpose for which they went. Mrs.
Baker .placed her little children in an or
phanage and was forced to work to sup
port herself.
, The separation from her little ones and
the cruel desertion of her husband caused
her to become despondent, and for the
'past year she has frequently resorted to
drink for the purpose of drowning her
" c"a re
Tbis morning she was heard crying in
lien room, and when some one went to her
she said that she had swallowed a dose of
carbolic acid. Dr. O. L. Jones was at once
summoned and relieved the woman before
the drug had commenced its deadly w rk.
Although bndly burned in the mouth and
tMront, she will almost certainly recover.
She denies any intention of trying to end
her life and says she took the drug by ac
cident.
DR. WENDTE REPLIES.
: Proud of Being the Longest .Estab
lished Protentaiit Minister In
Oakland.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Feb. 19.â Dr. Wendte
y-hed a long letter to-night in which |
jje criticized the revivalist Dr. Munnall for j
the remarks made by the latter gentleman
last night. Dr. Wendte says:
J regret to see that the revivalist Dr. Mun
hall Is very angry. This is not the temper in
which to commend the cos pel of a loving and
forgiving Christ to his hearers, nor is it favor- .
able to the "sober mind" in which religious !
differences should be discussed.
The doctrine of a lrcal, material and end- I
less hell is so abhorrent to the reason and con
science of enlightened man, so foreign to the
'general spirit cl Christ's teachings mid so !
blasphemes the lovinc fatherhood of God that
â  Ido not wonder Dr. Munha',l hastens to dis
avow all personal responsibility for It and
throws it upon the Bible, or rather upon car
. taiu passages in the Bible,
After referring at great length to various
. authorities to disprove the existence of a
literal and endless hell, the Unitarian
divine concludes as follows:
Mr. Mnnhall's personalities are Indifferent
me. He is a stmnger in Oakland, and it is
unseemly In him to criticize ana condemn
from liis tit tide r knowledge the longest settled
Protestant pastor over one and the same
church in this city, one of Its most intelligent
(congregations and the one most active in
gobfl works. The Kabiola Hospital, Humane
Sociotv, ' babot Home, Ebell Society, Starr
King Fraternity and* other charities and helps
to liifhi-r life In Oakland are our best reply to
Mich derogatory remarks. True, I am a liberal
in. religion. But liberalism does not mean in
difference. It means a way of thinking, the
\vn.y of truth in love. I try, at least, toobserve
both these principles in my public utterance*.
; Hut any cruelty, any inhumanity, rouses me,
whether In doctrinal teaching or in practice.
This Is why I publicly braided the horrible
end erroneous teaching of Mr. Munhail. For
every true, just, loving and helpful word he
tii'. -iv creak he will find me ever responsive and
grateful.

SCENE IN THE OAKLAND CITY PRISON.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 19. â Chief Lloyd, the labor onions, the Christian Endeavorers, the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children have all declared that the City Prison is quite unfit for the detention of young prisouers and others who
may be in the keeping of the police for various reasons, although not criminals. Successive Grand Juries expressed the same
opinion, and still nothing has been done. Young girls ana drunken old womon, and children, are necessarily herded together

Lent it was concluded not to stage the
opera until tne first week after Easter,
and, in the meantime, to study some other
opera ,o be produced after ''The Sor
cerer."

SNOWFALL AT ALVARADO
A Small Cloudburst Washes
Away a Part of Gr.zz y
Peak.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
BOS Broad wuy, Feb. 19. [
The storm of last niijht and this moru-
Inx has done but little damage in this
county, and with the exception of the
wrecking oi a few street signs and wooden
walls, no real damage is reported.
During the night a cloudburst struck
Grizzly Teak and washed out a large gully
in the side of the mountain. Several
bowlders and small trees were carried
away into the canyon.
At Alvarado much snow has fallen, and
for the first time in years the hills are
white almost to their base. On account
of there being so much snow and hail
with the storm there is not so much flood
ing at the salt marshes as there was in the
storm of two weeks ago. The Chinese
district is overflowed and many of the in
habitants have been forced to move to
higher lands, after having their furniture
destroyed.
The new culvert at Hayward*, which
was bunt last summer, has proved to be
all that was expected of it and for the first
time in many years li street has not been
washed away. The orchards have suf
fered to some extent by the soil being
washed away from the roots of fruit trees,
but many storms of shorter duration have
done # much more damage.
Tiio farmers at I'leasnnton have not
been able to sow their seed for this year's
crops and to them (he long rain is a great
disappointment, llai the crops oeen
sown a month a o they would now be
above grcumi. Even alter the rain ceases
i sev rai days must elapae Lefore the farm
ers can get to work.
The Ban Leandro Creek has not yet
overflowed, but after this morning's storm
the water had reached very near the
safety limit. Reports from all over the
county show that much less damage has
been done than was expected.

OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 19.â Mrs. B. F.
Dunham died at her home on Alice and
Durant streeis this afternoon. Mrs. Dun

operation could not save her life and she
was brought home.
Mts. Dunham has always been promi
nent in social circles and was an active
church member, being identified with
many of the charitable organization* in

WILL INVITE DELEGATES.
Oakland Wi i Benefi by the
National Convention Chris

Thousands of Wel!-Il ustrated Vol

Oakland Office Sax Fbawcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 19. (
The directors of the Oakland exposition
have decided to get the full benefit of the
presence of the Christian Endeavor dele
ga'es to the National convention in this
Sate. They haTe arranged that the an
nual Oakland exposition *ha!l take place
so as to cover the days that the conven
tion will be in session.
At the exposition there will be a grand
Christian Endeavor demonstration, and
special efforts will be made to bring thou
sands of the delegates to this side of the
bay. Tbe Endeavorers in this oity will
aid the project by every means in their
power, being equally anxious with the
exposition directors to advertise Alameda
County where the movement to bring the
National convention to the coast origina
ted.
A few days ago the Supervisors made an
appropriation to be used under the direc
tion of the Merchants' Kxcbang.- and
Board of Trade for the purpose of cir
culating 10.000 copies of a volume entitled
"Facts and Figures of Alaineda County."
Each of these books will bÂ»ar the im
print of the authorization of tne Board of
.Supervisors and will be accepted as relia
ble. It contains more matter compiled in
v more pleasant manner than anything of
the kind yet published in this city. Ii is
handsomely illustrated, entirely innocent
of all advertising matter and bears out
perfectly its title.
When the Endcavoren are here several
thousand of these volumes will be placed
in their hands, and by this means facts
and figures of Alameda County will be
carried into thousands of places where
they will be most useful, for it is every
where acknowledged that the very best
elements of social, commercial and re-
Jijtioui life are represented by that body.
M'MULLIN MOVED.

OAKLAND. Cal., Feb. 19.â Dr. D. A.
i McMullin, Republican nominee for School
Director from the Fourth Ward, bas with
drawn, and consequently there will be no
Republican candidate for School. Director
from that ward. A few day-' the Republi
can City Central Committee published
their ticket, with a blank opposite tbe
Fourth Ward School Director. Secretary
Bishop stated that this was done because
McMullin reiused to respond to the cam
paign-iund assessment. To-day tbe sec
retary received a letter from Dr. McMul
iin, in which be said that, having changed
bis residence from tbe Fourth to me Sev
enth Ward, he cannot be elected. He de
nies very indignantly that tbe assessment
bad anything to do with bis withdrawal.
As matters now stand, Dr. McMuliia's
name will be on the printed ballot, but
every vote for him will be a vote wasted.
It is too late now to make any changes,
tbe legal time for so doing having elapsed
a week Â«go.

COMMUTERS AS
PUBLIC OFFICIALS
The Question Has Been
Forced Into Municipal
Politics.
A Campaign Scheme That Mer
chants Are Anxious to Trace
to Its Source.
Attempt to Create Sympathy by an
Assumption cf Something
That Is Not.
Oakland Office Satt Fran-cisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 19. J
A feature which has always been more
or less prominent in local politics has
been brought forward at this time in a
very definite manner. It relates to the
opposition agiinst business men of San
Francisco wno reside in Oakland being
elected to municipal offices.
During the past few days an anonymous
circular has been sent to every prominent
citizen of Oakland regarding this oppo
sition. The circular pretends to set forth
that if this opposition be not withdrawn
the 4SOO commuters who reside here but
draw th^ir salaries in San Francisco will
be led to change their residence.
It is very evident that the circular has
been sent out in the interest of a few can
didates who are "commuters." One ol
these is Seth Mann, the Democratic candi
date for Mayor, who is a San Francisco
attorney, and the other B. C. Covelher,
who fs on the Republican ticket for Coun
cilman at large. The circular states that
tbo commuters are "clannish and know
that they are a class unto themselves,"
and the warning is given out that "if they j
are discriminated against the wiole army
of commuters, men and vromen alike, will
be antagonized."
"More tban this," it says, "the commu
ters, Knowing as they do'how much they
contribute to the support and welfare of
Oakland, feel that they have a right to
representation in administering the af
fairs of the city. They demand it as
their right and will not be denied. The
Oakland commuter cannot hold an elec
tive municipal office in San Francisco,
but every American citizen feels he has
the inherent right to aspire to political
i.onors in the city of his h. me, and he
will net surrender that right to the ca
price or prejudice of any clique. The
Oakland merchant would do well to think
it over twice before he concludes to dis
criminate politically against the very class
of people who contribute so largely to
his own support."
Leading members of the Merchants'
Exchange and the Board of Trade are
heartily condemning this method of cam
paigning and assert that it is a cheap
method of attempting to divert votes to
its authors. Reference is made to the fact
that one of the most active and useful
Mayors that Oakland ever had, Geortre C.
Pa rdee, is a San Franc: sco oculist. Now,
however, that the Mityor is a member of
the Police and Fire commissions and
Board of Works and should attend on an
average about one meeting a day the ar
eunient in favor of electing men to that
office whose business is in this city is
somewhat strengthened
SMOTHERED HER BABE.
The Child of Mrs. Stephen Keno of
North Berkeley l>ieÂ« by
Her Side.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 19. â Mrs.
Stephen H. Reno of 1731 Virginia street,
North Berkeley, accidentally smothered
to death her five-day-old babe this morn

way as to cut off its breathing. When
Mr?. Rono awoke she was horrified to find
her child cold in death by her side.
It was her first and only child, and the
mother is completely overcome with grief
as a result of the deat of the little one.
LIKE A BOOMERANG.

Tne Subject fcr the Big Intercollegiate
Debate Has Been
Chosen
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 19.â The criti
cism burled at the faculty of the State
University by the students through the
columns of the Occident on the ground of
their holding themselves aloof from stu
dent interests, as told in this morning's
Call, has had the effect of a boomerang,
and now some of the so-called dis
gruntled editor? wish they bad held back
their missile of reform.
So far as is known tbe author of too
linai referred to in the student journal
ban not been summoned before tbe fac
ulty for an explanation, but bis ears must
have fairly burned all day long because of
tne reflection of tbe soorcbing which be
intended to give the professors. The fac
ul;y in general regard his reference to
them as a piece of Mierility born or ig
norance. In fact the matter bas not so
far been regarded seriously.
STUDENTS TO CELEBRATE.

Jubilee at the State
University.
BERKELEY. Cal., Feb. 19.â The stu

to be present, which would not be the
case if held earlier in the week. Lieuten

ALASKANS COMPLAINING.
They Are Not Treated as Are
the People of th? O:her
States.
M. L. G Kaufman Enlisting Sympathy
ani Support From the Pacific
States.
Alaska is trying to secure better recog
nition from Congress, and to that end she
is enlisting the sympathy of the Con
gressional delegations of the States bor
dering on the Pacific. M. L. G. Kaufman
of Juneau is down here on a mission to
the commercial bodies to secure their sup
port, and he has received it. In speaking
of the situation up there and its needs, be
says:
We want a delegate In Congress who shall
be elected by our own people; a man who is
thoroughly conversun't wltn our needs and
who cau be of service to us in getting existing
lawi changed and new ones introduced. The
members of Congress are not the least de
pendent upon an Alaska constituency, and
for that reason are liable to overlook the Ter
ritory in its needs. Our demands are very
moderate and few. All we as-k of the Govern
ment is to treat us fairly and give us the same
laws as are given to any other portion of its
domain.
The prohibitory law pertaining to the im- |
porlatiou, manufacture and sale of liquors is :
one ot them. This law was passed many years i
ago, and Its purpo.-e was to prevent Indians
from obtaining liquor. At the time the law
was passed It operated splendidly and un
doubtedly was very useful in preventing
liquor from coming into the hands of Indians.
To-day it has exactly the opposite effect
Liquor is smuggled into an<l sold in the Ter
ritory from all quarters. We want this law
repealed and In place of it a law enacted
wnlcn permits the sale of liquor with a high j
license and binding restrictions. It will thus I
give us a class of people engaged in thai busi- |
ness, who are thoroughly responsible and re
liable, and who will not sell liquor to any j
others than whites. As it is now we have too
many saloons and some of them do not hesi
tate to fell liquor to the natives. All good,
law-abiding citizens of Alaska are very much
opposed to any liquor being sold to Indians,
and courts and juries have in every instance
inflicted the most severe punishment upon i
offenders when convicted.
If the Government would place a high
license upon Ibis business, a very considerable
revenue would be derived; while, on the other
hand, the liquor sold would be bought in
American territory, whereas it is now almost
exclusively bought aud smuggled in lrom
British Columbia.
We have absolutely no land laws whatever.
In the cities and other places the title to the
lana improved and built upon Is of no better
tenure than the mere temporary right of
possession. Such a condition Injures our pros
pects, ior capital Is very timid-aud is recluct
aut to invest where the claim toÂ«title is so very
uncertain. All we ask is for the Government
to give to us the same land laws as are given to
other portions of the Union.
Many petitions and requests have been
directed to Congress in our behalf, but without
material results. The possibility of accomplish
ing much in the line of legislation without a
n i, resentative has proven very difficult. We
believe that if a representative of our own Ter
ritory was admitted to Congress these matters
could be presented in mi intelligent and an
effectual manner.
The importance of my mission is highly ap
preciiited by the president and secretary of
your Chamber of Commerce, and 1 must say
you have the right men in the right places. I
will only add that Mr. Lip] man Soclis oi Sachs
Bros., in this City, who is a friend of my busi
ness firm, has shown me the utmost courtesy
and has materially aided me iv speedily ful
filling my mission.
In answer to his request Hugh Craig,
president of the Chamber of Commerce,
has sent the following to Washington:
To the Honorable Senate and House of Repre
sentatives, Washington, D. Câ Gentlemen: Tne
Chamber oi Commerce ot San Francisco re
spectfully calls your attention to the necessity
for the representation of the District of Alaska
in the House of Representatives. Its rapidly
increasing importance, its isolation and dis
tance lrom tho seat of our Gee eral Govern
ment and the anomaly of its Federal control
by a power thousands of miles distant, which
accords it no voico in the protection of its in
terests, appear valid reasons for your acqui
escence in this reasonable request We conse
quently pray that you will take the proper
steps to admit one representative from our
greutest Territory in the Fifty-fifth Congress.

WILL NOT INDOKSE.
The Federal labor Union Will Not Se-
lect Candidates.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 19.â The Federal
Labor Union held its weelcly meeting this
evening. Quite an animated discussion
arose over the political situation in Oak
land, and the question of indorsing candi
dates for the coming municipal election
was warmly debated pro and con. It was
finally resolved that in view of the fact
that bo many different Indorsements by
so-called labor leagues and political piece
clubs had been made, this sort of in
dorsement had become a stench in the
nostrils oi the laboring people and the
citizens at lame, and to escape the accusa
tion that might be made that the Federal
Labor Union was in line with any such
organizations it was the unanimous sense
of the Federal Labor Union that no in
dorsement of any set cf candidates be
made.

' FOOD COFFEE.
PORE IMAGINATION
Keeps Some Jt'eople 111.
Many people imagine they can do things
which they cannot; this is particularly
true of habits like the tobacco or coffee
habit. A person addicted to either of
these nabits may be one of such construc-
tion that the article used is poisonous to
him, but they imagine they can use coffee
(for instance) without any bad effect, for
"thousands of people do," they reason.
So the weak feeling or stomach trouble, or
headache, la charged one day to the hot
sun; the next day, taking pains to avoid
the sun, the old trouble shows up
again, so as long as it is not
the sun "it must be something I
have eaten, it can't be coffee." Then
follow some tests on diet, and still the
trouble continues; fevery known reason
will be tnought of and experimented with,
but they will not leave off the coffee, for
they like it too well. To such it may ba
suggested that matters be looked squarely
in the face. If you keen on with little
ails caused by some unnatural cause, you
will surely come down sick unless the
active cause is removed. Coffee contains
poisonous alkaloids in small quantities
which can be withstood by a perfectly
healthy adult, but which seriously affect
those who are a little below par physically,
or otiildren.
To such Postum Cereal comes as a
boon; it has the color of Java coffee,
creams up like thick Mocha and has a de-
licious fragrance and taste. It is made by
the Postum Cereal Co., Lira,,- Battle
Creek. Mich. "When tasted critically it
will be found to have a grain flavor that
is crisp and pleasant. It is strictly a food-
drink,' being made entirely of cereals
(wheat, etc.).
Postum, the grain coffee, will nourish
and fatten adults and children, and can be
used at every meal with decided ad-
vantage.
"Just as good" as Postum Cereal are
words used to defraud the public

TROUBLE FOR THE
SELLING PLATERS
Summertime, Walter J and
Boreas All Received
a Boost.
\
Three Favorites and Three Out
siders Woo the Purses
Yesterday.
Baquil Was First at Odds of 25 to 1
Ait zzo Too Speedy for
Imp- Sun
The fast daughter of Fitzjames, the racy
and mud- reveling Summertime, with a
history of her own, added another to her
long list of victories at Emeryville yester
day, and caused her trainer, Al Stemler,
not a little discomfitrA"e. She was one of
seven starters in the tilth race of the day,
a six-furlong selling tour, and with the
dangerous ones of the original company,
Applause and Hermanita, scratched, was
an odds on choice, going to the post 1 to 4.
6ne won, of course, in a mild sort of a
drive from Bookmaker George Rose's
entry, Torsina, second choice in th f ' ring.
She was entered to be sold for $400. and
wben the numbers of the first three Dorses
past tbe wire had been hoisted, Book
maker Rose left bis block and cniniiy
Baunierea aown to the region of me
judges' stand. Trouble was scented for
the winner and her trainer, nnd quite a
crowd braved tbe rain and followed in the
wake of the penciler.
Arriving at the stand Mr. Ruse smiled
at Mr. Stemler, as is his wont, and Mr.
Stemler appreciating the predicament the
mare had sot him into also, forgot to
smile. When Judge Burke announced
that the mare was entered to be sold for
$400 and asked if there was any advance
tue layer of odds casually remarked
fIOOO. Trainer Stemler secured & full
.Nelson on the railing in frontof thestand,
locked at Judge BurKe appeahngly and
articu;ated $5 A look full of sympathy
and good nature overspread the ieatuies
of Bookmaker Rose and he strode back to
the betting ring without a responsive bid.
Trainer Stemler had retained liis charge,
but he does not intend to ante us tbe run
up money if there is a ioophoie^f escape.
.dSier the race he protested payment of
the money on the grounds that Mr. Rose
is not owner of Torsina and is tbereiore
not entitled to any portion; of the boost.
Tnis part of the question will be settled by
the stewards.
It was quite a day by the way for gelling
platers to be disturbed with â¢'lifts."
Boreas, winner of the opening event, en
tered to be soid for $200, was bid up to Â£300
by Tom Woodford.and his owner, C. Lind,
let the Eastern plunger take the brown
horse. The next to fall in line was alter
J. The bay colt captured the last race at
adds of 15 to 1, and his owner, Frank
McDerraott, lost the purse as bookmaker.
Joe Ullman bid the horse up from $300 to
$600.
Intermittent showers of rain falling
contrived to make one of the most dis
agreeable racing days imaginable, and
the attendance was very light. The tract
â was in a sloppy condition, yet three of the
six choices managed to reach the wire
first.
The black horse Charles A went to the
post a 5 to 2 favorite /or the opening mile
Belling dash, but through Spencer's negli
gent tactics, for he laid way out of the run
ning, the back horse was tardy at the end,
and was beaten a head by Boreas, which
led from the jump. Ricardo was the run
ner up for six iurlongs. Woodchopper
ran a surprisingly good race, Bnistung a
good thir I. Cherrystone waÂ» bad y missed
about. The winner was alO to 1 chance.
Perseus was held a very close lavorite to
capture the mile selling run that ;ollowed,
the ring holding Pnrset's gelding at 2 to
5. Ransom, the second choice, led him
for nearly half the distance, when th
first choice took command and won by
less than a lfiigtn in 1:47 with little to
spare, Cameiia was a poor third.

l/eigh's big bay Arrezzo locked horns in
the third race over seven furlonjjs with
Moreno, Sweet William and Lady Hurst
as the only conteuders. Arrezzo went to
the post even money with 8 to 3 against
the black fellow. The 100 to 1 shot Moreno
and William made the running to the
stretch, wuere Cash Sloan on the favorite
gradually moved nj> and !ed Snin out a
neck at the vv.re. Sweet William ran a
fine race, being but a neck further away.
A miscellaneous assortment oi piaters,
thirteen in all. facd the barrier in the
next event, a five and a rial! funong
scramble, with Hannetta at 2]^ to 1 ruling
a slijrht favorite over Torpeuo. Neither
secured a mark. The 25 to 1 shot Basquil,
with Plggott up, rushed away in tne lead,
and staying there lasted lone enough to
beat Kov <. arruthers out a head In a hard
drive. Siepfrieii, a hot tip. was tbirt.
A surprise came In me final cv nt of the
aay, a mile selling affair, with a rield of
seven starting. Gene Leigh's recent pur
chase was hashed up a 3 to 2 favorite, but
developed as much liking for the slusny
gome as a "yaller" doc does for rough on
rats, finishing absolutely last. The game
colt Walter J, a 15 to 1 chance in the bet
ting, took up the running from the start,
and stalling off thÂ« chaiience of Caliente,
the 8 to 5 second choice, in the stretch,
beat Stemler's colt out half a length in
1:46. Thorpe, as usual, got Monita home
in third place.

1 a gross value of $4000, will be decided a;
Emeryville track to-day. Of the original
I entries bchiiler, Thornhill and Lobengula
will face the starter. The latter horde is
not apt to cut much figure, the issue ap
parently lying between the first two
named horses. Outside of this event the
card is a very good one.
Green B. Morris yesterday disposed of
Lobengula to Thomas H. Williams Jr.,
and he will be started in the Thornton

VERY LAX BOOKKEEPING.
Rspcrt of Grand Tury Investiga
tions in the 0 fice of the
School Board.
Mon-y T?ken and Pud Out in Lump
Sums That Leave Much to Be
Guessed At.
Tbe committee or the Grand Jury hav
ing in charge an investigation of the
me%o Is under which money is spent and
accounted for by the Board of Education
tiled its report yesterday. It discovers a
remarkably ioose system of bookkeeping.
It says in part:
The method emnloyed in keeping a record
of these transactions has been very faulty. In
the case oi the teachers' certificates and appli
cations for tuch the stubs oi me certificate
books were the only source from which the in
formauou could be guiici, w:ietner or not
any discrepancies occurred during 'he last six
years. This made it more difficult and con
sumed more time thai would otherwise have
been necessary had a b >ok or uccount been
kept to snow what money had been collected,
from whom, and what disposition was made of
It and when.
This Mr. Waller has since remedl 'd by hav
ing had preuarad a book ;or the purpose, and
by having nmclo it obligatory upon the person
having the matter in Charge to keep proper
accounts. The same faulty methods a]>ply to
the collection of rents nn'i tuition fees, aiij.in
fact, to the general lyatefll "f keeping ac
counts as they existed heretofore.
In the matter oi general expenditures no
record was kept of where certain permanent
Improvements or repairs were innde, to what
school or schools certain supplies and the
kind were delivered and the lost of such sup
plies, the amount expended for lights, water.
foal and rents, for library book*, bocks for in
digent children, etc.
Ah tties-e items were charged to the separate
committees having the respective expendi
tures in charge, and were accounted lor as a
whole, but no compilation was ever made to
show these transactions in detail.
An account has been kept at the depart
ment's storehouse of the different supplies
and materials received Â«nd. delivered to the
different schools, but never upon a basis of
cos;, or dollars and cents,
Mr. \Valler is now having prepared a tabu
lated book, which will give the entire monthly )
expenditures of the department, so segregated
as to show what supplies have been furnished
each school mid their Oast, the cost of labor
and material tor repairs made and where made,
the salaries paid to the teachers and janitors
in each school, the rents paid, wie cost of
lie tits, fuel and water as used in each school, j
in fact, 10 give in detail uud aggregate the cost :
to run each school and necessarily the aver- I
age cost per pupil attending such. It will also
show the cost to run the office, storehouse and
shop, in fact, cover every Item of expenditure
and enable the Board of Education to adjust i
them properly and evenly.
We iind a doable entry ledger has been |
opened, which will embrace the different ac- i
counts as above, as well as all others coming
under the head ot "Receipts and expendi
tures." From this ledger a monthly trial
balance will be drawn to verify the clerical
work and to snow the actual condition of
every account and of every lund and give a
comprehensive knowledge of the condition
of the department. L S. Kast, Chairman.

CARMEN SPEAK
THEIR MINDS
Some Scathing Resolutions
Against the Examiner
Adopted.
They Will Not Longer Suppor'
the Paper Because of Its
Policy.
A Big Mee'ing to Rejoice Over
the Defeal of Braunhart's
Bill.
WHEREAS, The San Francisco Exam
iner lias on every occasion possible
shown its hostility to tin- Street Kail
road Employe! of Sun l''ranciisco, par
ticularly in its advocacy of the Braun
hart '-i' 2 cent streetcar fare bill, be it
therefore
UEgOLVED, That we denounce the
course of the San Francisco Examiner
for the â¢> t mii it ha* taken against us in
our fight against this Iniquitous meas
ure. And in view of the Examiner'a
persistent effort! to create strife be
tween labor and capital, be it further
RESOLVED, 'Â£ hat Â«re condemn such
methods of journalism as being detri
mental to tho Interest! of the entire
community, and we call upon all our
coworkers to discontinue their sub
scriptions to the Examiner. And be it
further
K. SOLVED, That we. the employes of
the various street-railroads within the
City and County San Francisco, hereby
deem it to our interests not to patron
ize the store* of any merchant In said
City and County whose advertisements
appear exclusively in the Kxaminer.
RKSOI.VKI), That a copy of these res
olutions be Furnished to the pres*.
W. C. COOK, 1043 Noe street,
FRANK BELL. 34 Austin avenue,
P. J. MANMX... 3205 Clay street,
G. A. GRIMES, 1504 O'Farrell street,
K. S. BABOY, 292 California avenue.
Such was the sentiment most emphatic
ally expressed last night by 700 streetcar
conductors ami gripmen.
They had come from all parts of the
City through the storm and alter their
day's work to rejoice at the defeat of the
bid for the reduction of car fares and to
denounce the Examiner as their worst
enemy.
They represented the 5000 street-railroad
employes ol trie City, tlie most numerous
single class of men at work in San Fran
cisco to-day.
Tney were assembled in Mission Parlor
Hall, in Seventeenth street, near Valencia,
not as excited sentimentaliets, but as cool,
thouzhtful, sober-minded workingnien,
and as such conducted themselves.
The strength of the feeling against the
course of the Examiner, i>nd the entire
unanimity with which it was repeatedly
expressed, left tin doubt as to the complete
contempt in which the street-railroad men
of Sau Francisco now hold t .at paper.
The meeting was presided over by W.
C. Carpenter. In a short address he ex
plained the purpose for which it was held.
But every one present knew that. So did
the others still at work on the cars and
tho~e who were too tired from their long
day's labors to brave the rough weatber
simply to add their voices to a sentiment
that all hold as one man.
The delegation had just returned from
Sacramento triumphant, it had gone up
to the State capital less than two week
before to oppose a bill that seemed almost
certain to pass because of a lack of organ
ized opposition to it.
P. J. Manning, a grlpman on fv>e Powell
"md Jackson-street system and a member
of the delegation, was one of the first
speakers of the evening.
He told of the work the delegates had
done among the Senators in showing the
petition signed by 5000 street-railroad em
ployes who would personally suffer from
a reduction of wages were carfares re
duced. He declared that with only two
exceptions the Senators who finally voted
against the bill had been convinced of its
unfairness by the statement of the case
presented by the railroad men's dele
gation. The two exceptions were Sena
tors who from principle voted against the
biil because it originated with Braunhart.
"As to the Examiner," said Mr. Man
nine, "we all know how it has treated us.
No matter what the care and caution of a
gripman, if some one has run in front of a
car and been hurt the Examiner has in
variably laid the- blame on the gripman
and has repeatedly distorted and exuber
ated the facts in order to maKe out another
case against the Vining system. No mat
ter if a hundred people have come lorward
as witnesses to prove that the accident
was beyond human power and skill to
avert, the Examiner has followed its same
course regardless of truth or justice.
"In the last ten years the Examiner
has done more than all other causes com

The Italians are sturdy, hardworking, enter-

occupants of penitentiaries, though some are
illiterate. I state this after over forty
years of experience among them in this coun-
try. They invest in realty and their chil-

PETE MAY BE AVENGED
His Nephew Supposed to B?
Quarantined on the
China.
Chung Y.ung Hue Is His Nam \ and
He Is a Member of Pete's
Local Firm.
The murderers of Little Pete, the Chi
nese gamMer, merchant and power in the
Chinese worid of ban Francisco, are not |
to go unavenged if the relatives of the
dead man can help it, r.nd it 's bel.eved
that the hour or retribution is near.
fcince the steamer China arrived on
Thursday evening with forty-nine Chi
nese in ncr steerage, members of the i^.-ini
Yup Company, to which Pete belonged,
and of the See Yap Company, which is
popularly believed to have instigated the
killing, have been watching eagerly for
her passengers to come ashore that they
may search for a face dreaded by one and
welcomed by toe other.
From the fact that nothing, not even n
passenger-list, has been allowed to leave
the vessel, because of the smallpox on
board, the members of both societies are
on the anxious seat, and will be until the
ship's papers are thoroughly fumigateu.
'J he much - looked - lor passenger is
Chung Yeans: Hue, a nephew of the mur
dereU man, who is. understood to be on
board. Jie may have misled connections
with the Chini ai Hongkong, but it is
confidently believed that he is on boam
ami that once ashore he will , ive the nig
nal that will start the highbinders on the
trail of prominent Bee Yaps.
ChuiiK Yeung Hue is a remarkably blight
young Chinese, vmio in facial characteris
tics, as well as intellectual capacity, much
resembles hi* late lamented relative. He
is a member of Heinit: Yuen ( fc Co.. the
firm of which Little Pete was me head,
and was trusted oy tne Â«le:td man with
many important transactions for the
house.
In July last, when the troubles between
the See Yup and Sam Yup societies began
to develop into a vendetta, the nephew
was sent by I'eie to China on an import
ant mission connected with tbe mutter,
which, if successful, was expected to re
suit in the complete discomfiture ol the
See Yups. He ieft San Franc. sou in the
ino.ith mentioned, ami wa- in Hongko:iE
when the news ol Pete's murder was
cabled to the relatives in Cnina by mem
bers uf Heunjr Yuen it Co.
He was asfceu to hurry to America to
assist in ferreting cm aii'l punishing the
slayers of his ancle. I'liis means, to tne
Chinese mind, that it he is as "nervy" a
man as tiie one who died by an assassin's
bullet, a chair in the See Y'up council
will be vacant as soon as some highbinder
can waylay the victim.
Little Pete died in the barber's chair on
January 24. and allowing two days for the
cablegram tn reach Chunc Y'eung Hue, he
would still hiive time to catch the China
before sliÂ» .'ailed on January 26 for this
port via Yokohama.
Chung Y'eung Hue ia a native-born Chi
nese, has merchant's papers and will he
able to land without difficulty when the
short period of quarantine is over. He
spealts English remarkably we.i and is
said to be as unscrupulous and daring as
his deceased uncle was i n his lifetime.
The Chinese merchants believe lhat he
will at once increase the reward offered
by Little Pete's widow for the ajrem and
conviction of the murderers, and that the
notice of reward will require a more sum
mary method ot vengeance.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1897.
FUGAZI WIRES
THE PRESIDENT
A Plea That Italians Be
Allowed to Come to
America.
Opposition to the Proposed Law
to Exclude All Who Are
I i iterate.
Secretary Carlisle and Biron Fava
on Some Phases ot Immi
gration.
J. F. Fugazi, the well-known Italian
banker, is opposed to the proposed law to
exclude illiterate foreigners from the
United States. He yesterday sent Presi
dent Cleveland a telegram on the subject.
It is interesting in connection with tin
subject of Italian immigration to note the
faci that Herman Siutnp, Commisaioner-
Oeneral of Immigration, has lately re
ported to .Secretary Carlisle that the
Italians and Europeans in general are
comply. ng quhe strictly with American
law?. Jlesays:
'From general observations in Europe I
am satislied that the knowledge that our
laws have been enforced will prevent in
future the migration of the prohibited
classes."
Leiler* from Baron Fava and the Mar
quis ih Eladlni snow that tne Italians are
anxiou- to comply with our law.-,. The
rovdl Ministry cf Italy, however, bat
claimed fora long time that "there is too
much vagueness and indetinitcness in
that portion of the American law whicn
provides for the resnipment to the port
whence they sitiled ot persons who have
been convicted of capital" crimes or of any
other infamous crimes, or ol offenses im
plying moral turpitude, and desires tv ob
tain from the Treasury Department data
and information showin^; with accuracy
v.hat sentences pronounced in Italy upon
subjects of the kingdom .-re of n nature to
create an obstacle to their landing in the
U'lited States, and consequently to justify
a refusal of a passport in Italy to such
persons."
< onunenting on the foregoing corre
spondence, (Secretary Carlisle recently
said, in a communication to the Commis
sioner of Immigration:
"From the a.~-uranies contained in thia
letter 1 am sat.siied that this friendly
Government does not intend to permit its
subjects to violate our laws, and desires at
the same lime, by the refusal of passports
to such as ar^ liable to be rejected and de
ported, to prevent them from embarking
upon a fruitless voyaee. I deem this mat
ter of sufficient importance to direct you
to prcceed to Italy and furnisu in person
this iniormation.
There is just now, therefore, more inter
est in foreign immigration than there has
been for many years. Tiie telegram ol
Mr. FuÂ«azi shows that the Italian-, do not
want to be chut off from coming to this
country, save fur crave causes.

McDonald MUsiug.
Daniel J. McDonald, a bookkeeper re
cently employed by A. & A. Baker of
Hayes street, has mysteriously disap
peared, and bis wile, who but a few days
ago became a mother, and his relatives
are much worried about him.
McDonald eft his residence at 5 Olive
avenue Thursday morning, ostensibly to
go to work for the Makers, where ue had
obtained employment but the day previ
ous. That is ttie last that is known of
him, and there is nothing in his condi
tion or affairs of which his friends are
aware which furnishes a clew to his ab
sence.

CHARITY FOR LITTLE CHILDREN IS THEIR PLEA.
In the comedy of "Caste," to be presented at the California Theater on MarcQ
1, Miss Leila Burton will play tie part of a charming but strugging young actress,
who is loved and won by a military ollicer of high social rank.
The incidents and complications resulting from the union of two distinct social
elements give the play its name. It is the old story of love that disregards
imaginary obstacles set up by a class that is conscious and proud of its sulf
asserted superiority.
Miss Burton is a daughter of Colonel George H. Burton, inspector-general oF
the I'.:citic Division, U.S.A. But except for such initial preference as she may
feel toward a representative ol her father's profession she will have assumed tbe
character of Esti er Ecdea unaided by any preliminary advantage that would
have come from experience on tne stage. This will be her tirsi apj.earance before
ihe footlights. A pretty face, an easy manner, some experience in elocution and
careful study and rehearsal of the part, may be expected to tit her well for the
character of the f;*<cinating girl, who, while helping to support an unworthy
parent, is won and married by the son of a proud woman, and subsequently suffers
much before her Dusband, retorted iiead, return* from military service in India,
just ns his mother has become reconciled to the actress wife.
For four weeks now tho-e who are in the cast have been rehearsing nightly,
either at the Standard Theater or at the old Buah-atreet, under the careful direc
tion oi Leo Cooper.
All the others that are to take part have had some experience in amateur
theatrical.-; on both sid** of the bay, and with a^reeabie results.
Tickets for the coming entertainment will be sola by representatives of
different charitable societies, and on|Saturday forenoon, February l' 7, Miss Fanny
Kice will sell the boxes by auction.
The funds will ie contributed partly to tbe Children's Hospital and partly to
the Armitage Church Orphanage, now entering new City quarters at the corner of
Folsom and Second streets.

SOMERS HELD UP NOLAN
The Latter's Wife and Albert
"Wieiand, in the Party,
Intimidaed
It Is Another 0 d Score in Connection
With the Treadwell Estate
bquabblt \
Caivin F. Somera nas been arrested by
Detective Charles J. Cody on a charge of
exhibiting a deadly wfiipon.
The prisoner produced $200 bail money
and was immediately released from cus
tody yesterday afternoon.
Ttie arrest is only another feature of thÂ«
protracted criminal ami civil controversy
waged between Somers ami the Tread wells.
Somers is a brother of the late Mrs. Ma
bel TreadweH, who left an estate valued
at many millions of dollars, and he has
been in lecal controversy with the heirs
for some years.
The children of Mrs. Treadwell are the
wards of ex-Sheriff Bollinger of Santa
Clara County, in whose home they have
resioed lor a long while.
Somers brought suit some days ago
against the estate lor an accounting in a
matter amounting to $ 14 .000 and it was
necessary to serve papers on Mrs. J. F.
Nolan (formerly Maude Treadweii) to ap
pear before Commissioner Mohn of this
City *.o eive her deposition.
He therefore went to San Jose and hear
inji that Mrs. Nolan and her husband
were out drivinc followed them until a
rneptinp was had on the roadway.
Mr. Nolan was dnvine and his wife sat
in the rear seat of the vehicle with Albert
Wieland. the son of the late John Wie
land, brewer.
Soraer3, so says Detective Cody, at
tempted to serve the papers by driving His
horse across the road so as to prevent the
party from escaping.
"When this occurred," explained Cody,
"Aloert Wieland stepped out and took
S. mers 1 horse by the bridle. Somers
then leveled a pistol at the entire party
and insisted upon their remaining quiet
until he could serve the papers.
"It is on account of this that Joseph
Nolan, the husband of the lady, lias
sworn out a warrant for Somers' arrest.
'â¢Soruers has deposited bail and will re
turn to Giiroy for trial before Justice
Howard Willev, who issued the warrant."

Mrs. Grace Hamilton told a terrible tale

Mrs. Hamilton swore that she was com

give her sufficient money 10 buy food for
herself and their chiM ; that he would not
even allow her to buy a spool oi thread
witnout making a fuss and asking what
became of that other spool of thread ihat
she hud Jast week.
On cross-examination Mrs. Hamilton
admitted that she was out until 2 o'clock

her mother and returned with her mother
with her husband's consent. He made
no objection until afterward.

A CONSPIRACY
AMONG OFFICIALS
The Grand Jury Is Con
vinced by Evidence
in Hand.
Uncertain Whether There Is
Law Enough to Cover
the Case.
May Find an Indictment Next Week
in the City and County
Hospital Fraud,
After weeks of careful and thorough in
vestigation the Grand Jury has been con
vinced â that is to say is now convinced â
that between members of the late Board of
Supervisors and certain late officials of the
City and County Hospital and certain
contractors there was a conspiracy by
which the City was robbed of several
thousand? of dollars.
All yesterday afternoon was civen up to
a discussion of this matter, the jury being
in consultation with the District Attor
ney. No conclusion was arrived at â at
leas*, no action was taken. The jury will
pursue the matter furtherâ to its ultimate
limitations, it is altogether within the
line of probability that an indictment
may be found at the next session, on
Tuesday of next week.
The sum of $10,000 was appropriated by
the last Board of Supervisors for certain
improvements at the City and County
Hospital. Under the law public work to
cost above $500 must be let by contract.
Work for sums less than this may be
tiven without contract. The $10,000 was
expended in small sums in this way /or
the carryiug on of work that when fin
ished cost much above the $500 limit.
Out of all this and much testimony be
sides showing that the most flagrant
frauds had been committed under this
loose system, mismeasurements of worK â
that is, in tne bills â and excessive charges
for time and materials, ihe jury is con
vinced tiiat there has been a complete
understanding in this matter, and is de
termintii, it it o;in rind a law under which
it may be done, to indict one or more of
the persons against whom the evidence is
most certainly directed.
Another matter that was especially un
der consideration yesterday was the evi
dence taken during tue la-t two or three
sitting-, which pe<?ms to implicate ex-Su
perintendent Stable particularly. That
was regarding the appropriation" of car
pets and furniture of the hospital to his
own u>p.
The Grand Jury is uncertain in this
ca-e, as in tne others, as to whether there
i? a law covering the matterâ whether the
acts of the superintendent consume a
felony, a misdemeanor or malfeasance in
ottice. Members of the jury complain that
they are constantly met with thi3 matter
oi ineffective laws. Superintendent Stahle
hr\a offerea to make restitution of what
ever sum the jury deem him to have
misappropriated, and this is deemed, in
the language of P^oreman Peixotto, "an
extenuating circumstance."
