EDHEM PASHA'S TROOPS ON THE
WAY TO LARISSA. I
But a New Element of Danger to Ottoman
Success Is the Threatened Joining of
the Servians With the People
of the Hellenes*
Very meager and conflicting are the reports from the Thessalian
frontier. It would seem, however, that there has been a pause in the
inarch of the Turkish forces upon Larissa.
One report is that Edhem Pasha, the commander-in-chief of the
Turkish forces in Macedonia, has returned to Elassona to secure re-en
forcements, desiring to make success certain in the attack on Larissa
by force of numbers. However, both sides are rushing forward all
their available re-enforcements, preparatory to a great battle that may
virtually decide the war.
Advices from Athens indicate that Larissa, the headquarters of
c Greek army, has not yet been invested by the Turks. The Otto
man forces penetrated as far as Mati, where there was a fierce engage
ment and brilliant resistance on the part of the Greeks. Crown Prince
Constantine was in the battle.
A new element of interest and importance has entered the conflict.
Bulgaria shows her teeth to Turkey and demands certain concessions,
which, if denied, will cause the Bulgarian army to be mobilized.
Private advices received in San Francisco last night show that not
only Bulgaria but Montenegro and Servia may join with Greece in the i
war against Turkey.
Nelson A. Miles, the commanding general of the United States
army, is going to Europe to observe the warfare between the Turks
and the Greeks. The assignment of an officer of such high rank is
considered as indicating the belief of this Government that there are
prospects of a general European war.
NEWS IS CONFLICTING.
But It Is Certain That Both Sides
Are Preparing: for a Decisive
Battle.
LONDON, Eng., April 22.â There is con
flict in the news from the seat of war.
Greek accounts are almost silent regard
ing the loss of Milouna Pass and the
Turkish advance toward Larissa, but give
full and most enthusiastic news anent the
fsuccesse? at Reveni and other points.
, These successes, however, are vaguely
. and confusedly described. A series of
(reports emanating from Larissa indicate
'that the Mti and Ligaria positions are
;now mainly in dispute. It appears that
?tbe Turks, after capturing these places,
! made sorties from them, but were com
pelled to retire after obstinate fightine
,' lasting throughout Tuesday. It is likely
to be found in several instances that re-
I ports, apparently distinct, actually refer
(to the s&iii* incidents, owing to mistakes j
arising from the confusion of dates and J
tte fact that many places have two or j
more names.
Dispatches from the Turkish side are
atill strangely meager, although those
I which come confirm the previous accounts
â ot the successful invasion of Thessaly.
â¢ The capture of some positions at Nezeros,
which ib admitted by the Greeks, is
claimed by Turkish sources to have been
a complete seizure of all positions there,
â¦ neutralizing whatever advantages the I
Greeks h.iv* obtained elsewhere on the
Thessalinn frontier, as the position at
Is'ezeros is very strong.
There is no direct news from the front

! tween Milouna and Turnavo. It is vir
tually csrtain that the Turks had not then
occupied the latter place, nor are very
near Larissa.
An unconfirmed report emanating from
Salonica, the Turkish base, represents
Edhem Pasha, the Turkish commander
in-chief, as having returned to Kius.-ona
to personally supervise the bringing of re
enforcements, being determined to make
success certain by force of numbers. It
is an undoubted fact that both sides are
rushing forward all available re-enforce

An Exciting Incident While on the Way to

ROME, Italy. April 22.â While King
Humbert was driving to Campanelle
racetrack this afternoon a man who pre
tended that he wanted to present a peti
tion to the King approached the car
riage. Ab he reached the vehicle the man
drew a dagger and made a lunge at the
Kinir, but the latter warded off the blow,
and the dagger struck the cushion of the
carriage.
In an instant all was confusion. The
King's escort charged upon the crowd,
which, in the excitement, closed upon the
royal carriage, while others ol the Kitig's
guard seized the man wiio had attempted
to take iiia Majesty's life and bore
him off.
The King was perfectly composed, and
proceeded on the way to Campanelle and
witnessed the races as though nothing
had happened.
The King's assailant proved to be Fietro
Acciarua, aced 24, who is believed to be
insane. He is a blacksmith, and came
from Artena. He declares ha nan no con -
nection with any political party.
Tne King was repeatedly cheered upon
his arrival at the races, and vhen he re
turned to the city he was greeted with a
great popular ovation by the thousands
who thronged the streets upon learning of
the attempt to assassinate him.
As King Huraoert entered Naples No
vember 17, 1878, the year of his ascension,
a man named Giovanni Passanante ap
proached the carriage and attempted to
ussassinate him with a dagger. The King
escaped with a scratch, but Prime Minis
ter Cairoli was badly wounded, i'a^sa
nante was condemed to death, but the
King commuted the punishment to im
prisonment for life.

WHITE FULL OF FIGHT.
Retroactive Clause in the New Tariff Bill
Dropped Subsequent to His Positive.
Demands.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 22.â The
Republican Senators who are revising the
tariff have decided to drop the retroactive
clause adopt dby the House. They have
been forced to take this stand on account
of the position of certain Democratic Sen
ators, particularly White of California.
White recently returned from the West
full of riebt. "A number of prominent
men residing in my State," he said,
"would be practically ruined if this clause
is enforced."
To Aid rich and Allison he said : ' 'Unless
you positively assure me this clause will
be withdrawn, I shall right the tariff bill
at every stage and hinder its passage as
lone as possible."
After consultation with his Republican
colleagues, Allison informed White that
they had agreed to drop the retroactive
clause.
; White also intimated that he could not
agree to the demands of the sugar trust

SENATORS WANT
COMMITTEES FILLED
Morgan Declares That|
Congress Is Merely
a Dictatorship.
In a Fiery Debate He Styles
Speaker Reed the â  Great
White Filibuster."
Allen Introduces a Resolution Ex
pressing: Sympathy for the
People of Greece.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 22.â As j
*oon as the routine morning business of
the Senate was concluded the Populist I
Senator from Nebraska (Allen) offered a !
resolution expressing the sympathy of i
ihe people of tbe United States with the
people of Greece in their struggle with
the Turks.
A resolution was offered by the Populist
Senator from Nnrtb Carolina (Butier) in- |
structing (he Postorhce Committee to
inquire and report whether a postal say- I
ings bank system can be successfully put
in operation by the Government.
This resolution was made ihe basis of a j
fiery Epeech by Morgan. He took the
ground that there is now no regularly â 
crganiz d committee in ihe Senate, in- j
asmuch as vacancies had not been filled,
and he was particularly severe in his ;
strictures on the House on account of its i
disorganized condition. In fact, he said, j
ihe Fifty-fifth Congress was not a Con- j
gress, but a pure dictatorship, entirely >
contrary to the spirit of tbe Government. {
There had been no action taken in either
house relating to their organization whicn
did not have distinct reference to the
future prosperity of political parties.
There were a great many things pressing
for attention in Congress and there never I
was more occasion for generous, compre
hensive and deliberate action than ri
present.
Sewell of New Jersey reminded Morga
the Senate was acting under a resolution
adopted at the close of the last session,
continuing the committees aa at present ;
organized until further orders.
Morgan replied that he thought tbe â¢
Senate was acting in a very l aphazard
way. He characterized the proposition to '
establish a closure rule a< a comical ex- '
perituent, particularly in view of the fact
that the Senate refused to name the com- !
raittees necessary to carry out legislation.
He bitterly scored the House's policy in â 
sction, characterizing Reed as the "Great
White Filibuster."
Butler withdrew his resolution, and !
then Allen offered one declaring tliat no
business, legislative or executive (except j
the consideration of appropriation bills), I
shall be transacted by ihe Senate during ;
this Congress until the committee vacan- j
cic-s are fined.
There was some badinage between Al- ]
len and Chandler. Chandler objected to
the present consideration of the resolu- j
tion and it went over.
Hoar asked to have laid aside for a week
his resolution for the discharge of the ;
Committee on Rules from further consid- ;
eration of hu proposed amendment es- '
tablishing closure. Tnis was agreed to,
with the addition that Allen's resolution
bhall take precedence of it.
At 3 o'clock in pursuance of tbe previous
agreement the vote waÃ taken on Nelson's
substitute lor the bankruptcy bill ana it
was agreed to â ayes 34, noas 22â after
the statement by Nelson that all bodies |
technically known as corporations were
excluded from its opera;ions. The sub- |
Btitute, having thus taken the place of j
the original bill, was then open to further !
amendments. On motion of Bacon the
eighteenth section, which provides the act j
shall be construed to repeal or suspend j
State laws on the subject, was stricken!
out. The bill was then passedâ ayes 49, noes i
8. It lifts the operation of the law from J
cases of voluntary bankruptcy, exclud
iug from its operation any dÂ»btor, other
than a corporation, owing $200 or more,

file a petition in the United States Distrct j
Court, attaching to the petition a schedule j
and list of all his property and debts and I
HAFIZ PASHA, the Moslem Hero Who Was Killed at
Melouna Pass Last Saturday.
The death of Hariz was deeply deplored by his followers. He was 80 years of
age, and while advancing at the hea.i of hia troops was urged Jo dismount and
rest. The old Pasha replied: "During the Russian war I never dismounted and
why should Ido so now?" Soon afterward Hariz Pasha was wound-d in the arm
but he still remained in the Baddle. Later a second bullet struck him on the hand'
but yet he refused to retire. Finally a third Duliet broke his spine and he rolled
from his saddle dead. Hatiz first saw service in the Turkish army in the Crimean
War. He also served with distincuished bravery all through the Russo-Turkish
War. He-was in command of a part of the forces employed against the Bulgarian
insurgents in 1876 and was responsible for the frightful massacres, p:ll H gings an.l
burning that characterized that epoch in Turkish history. He was terribly and
fearlessly scored by Eugene Schuy.er in a special report of his investigations

from his debts and liabilities. If the court
rinds the facts alleged in the petition be
true it stiall adjudge the petitioner bank

and dispose of his properly and distribute
the proceeds.
All preferences piven within lour
months prior to filing the petition are de
clared null and void. An attorney's fee

the assignee is entitled to a fee not ex

Tbe death of Representative Holman
was announced, appropriate resolutions
were adopted and the Senate adjourned
till Monday.
BESSIO\ Of- IUE BOVSE.
It It Decided to Consid-r Senate Amend
Â»><â¢Â»/ in Committee of the Whole.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 22.â The
; proceedings of the House to-day gave
â¢ every indication of that body being thor
oughly organized and equipped for wort.
, This seeming quiescence in the demand
! for policy of action was not reached an til
j Bailey had score! the first two victories as
the leader of the minority. There was the
usual ineffectual meeting of the Commit
i tee on Rules, lasting an hour, which pre
ceded the session, and the first business
suggested was by D.ilzellof Pennsylvania,
who presented a report of the Committee
on Rules, providing that until the appro
priation bills have been finally acted i pon
i to cor side r the Senate amendments with
' out reference to a committee.
This provoked a discussion, a notable
, feature o which was the effort of Repre
! sentative Robison (D.)of Tennessee to ad-
I vise Bailey as to the effect of a desultory
' debate before the adoption of the pre
' vious question, which Daizell had moved.
Bailey informed his associate he was per
f ctly awar â¢ of what he was doing and of
the effect upon the parliamentary situa
tion. He suggested an amendment to the,
iule so as to apply it to the Indian appro
priation bill alone, leaving other bills to
be dealt with as they came before the
House. This was agreed to by Daizell.
Bland vigorously protested against this
course of dealing with the Indian bill.
The House bad a right, he said, to its
committees, and these matters should be
referred to them. Daizell sarcastically re
marked that the right of the gentleman
irom Missouri to present â
Bland (vehemently) â I protest against
â¢II of your arbitrary proceedings.
Daizellâ Of course, we understand that.
The resolution was agreed 10 as modi
fied, and the consideration of Senate
amendments to the Indian bill was en
tered upon without limit or debate. Bailey
secured the next parliamentary victory by
having ail amendments to the bill re
ferred to the committee of the whole for
! action, against tiie efforts of Sherman (R.)
, of New York, in charge of the bill, and
i the suggestion that Speaker Reed divide
the amendments between the House and
the committee of the whole.
Discussion in committee of the whole
was opened by Bland, who emphasized
tne protest he bad previously made against
the manner of procedure. . Nearly two
hours were spent in discussing the amend
ments of the Senate to open the Un
compahere reservation in Utah in Janu
ary. Without disposing of the matter the
committee rose.
Stesle of Indiana announced the death
of his colleague, Holman. The usual reso
lutions were adopted and the House
adjourned.

on the investigation recently held by the
Public Lands Committee on alleged
fraud in issuing patents on land in Florida
known as the Perrine grant. Pettigrew
attacked the majority report, which ex

that no honest officers would have proofs j
of compliance in the terms of the grant,
Mid that the evidence in the case dis- I
closes a condition in the land office which j
demands attention from Congress. The
chief interest in the case is that the Per

Whereas, In the war now in progress be

Speolal Secret Mission*
ODESSA, Russia, April 22.â A ipecial
secret mission irorn the Greek Govern
ment passed through here yesterday on
the way to St. Petersburg.
SERVIANS MAY RISE.
There Is a Prospect of These Bold
People Joining: the Greeks
to Fight Turkey.
M. 6. Chiuda, one of in* editors of the
San Francisco Slobada, which means lib
erty, has just received word from Euro
pean friends that there is a likelihood of a
general uprising of the Servian people
a ainst the Turks.
Speaking of the matter last night, he
said: "A local Servian society has re
ceived a letter from the headquarters of
the Servian Red Cross Society at Belgrade
to the effect that it is likely that Monte
negro, Serviaand Bulgaria will join with
Greece in tae war against Turkey. The
letter calls on patriotic Servians in this
country to contribute to the fund for the
wounded and oppressed in old Servia."
Leadinc members of the Serviau-Monte
negrin Benevolent Society here say they
are willing to contribute liberally to the
fund in the event of such complications
las the letter foreshadows.
OBSTACLES IN THE WAY.
Field Marshal Edhem Pasha's
March Toward Athens Will Not
Be an Easy One.
To premise that Eihem Pasha will meet
with no serious obstacle on bis march
from Lsris<a to Athens except at Pbar
sala ana Thebes is 10 entirely ignore the
natural strategic features of the country
through which he must pass an{l to credit
the Greeks with cowardice and their lead
ers with entire lack of generalship, in the
face of the proof to sde contrary that they
have given at Milouna and Reveni passes
and other points within the last week.
From the frontier to the plains of Larissa
i he Turkish commander's way was a con
tinual descent, being always able to over
look the Greek troops if. front of him, and
with his superior forces successful resist
ance in the end was hardly to be ex
pected.
From Larissa to the Gulf of Lamia three
j routes lie before him. One to the west
along the Peneus to the junction of the
! Phusulites and thence southeast along
! that stream to the city of Phasala and on
jto Lamia; the second, directly south
! through the Kara Dagh Mountains to that
city, and the tljird'hlong the line of the
| highway and railroad toward Volo, and
I t be nee south along the coast to Halmyros
| and over the Yuakovani Mountains to
! Lamia.
The second route is the most direct and
is perhaps as practicable lor an invading
army as either of the other*. It is the
maiu highway to Athens. With proper
generalship an inferior force conld make
stand and delay, if not repulse, an invad
ing army at a hundred d fferent points
along the road, overiookeJ as it irty hills
which, beginning live miles south of Lar
issa, rise gradually to the crest of the
ridge some 2500 feet high which overlooks
iho valley of the Phersalitis River and the
city of Phersala on the s>outh side. Even
with this journey accomplished and Pher
sala reached the same conditions would
prevail and the same opportunities for de
fense, only to a greater degree, until he
reached the crest of the Ortheys Moun
tains overlooking the city of Lamia and
the gulf near whicb it is situated.
The road from Pheisula begins ascent
to the high ground through a defile or
pass, which has ever been famous for its
defensible features, and many other such
are in the way until through the high
valleys of the Tchianari the road takes its
way up over the summit of Ortheys.which
it crosses at an elevation of 2500 feet.
Should the Turks, in spite of all opposi
tion reach Lamia, the city would be un
tenable for them with the Greek war
ve?sels armed with their high power csnet
truns, live miles away in the gulf. From
Lamia, the road passes Thermopylae, and
with the exception of one place at
Anteras point, for thirty-five miles runs
within a miie of the coast, and is exposed
to fire from vessels in Atalanta Channel.
Admitting that no practical opposition
is offered to Edh^m's advance between
Larissa and Lamia â cut off trom com
munication with Salonika by sea and
compelled to maintain a long inland line
of transportation over a rough country â
the matter of advancing as far as Lamia
is a matter of many weeks if not months.

CHIEF JOSEPH
IN NEW YORK
Visit of the Nez Perces
Leader to the Metro
polis.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 22. -Chief
Joseph of the N'ez Perces. the leader of
the Wallowa Valley rebellion in 1877 and
next to the Sioux warrior, Red Cloud, the
most prominent Indian alive, arrived
here, with a suite, to see the city's sights,
at the special request of General Miles, who
conducted the campaign against the chief
twenty years ago, and who from being a
relentless foe became a friend and ad
viser of the oid Indian. Buffalo Bill has
taken Chief Joseph under his wing.
In all his life Chief Joseph has never
been so far away from home. Tne largest
city he wai ever in before was Portland,
Or., and he left there in disgust after two
clay* because of the ways of city people.
Now York has interested the chief on
account of its size and architectural won
ders, but he has not much more patience
with the East than he had witn the West.
He said to-day:
"It's three weeks since I left the reser
vation to Washington. I left behind 150
Nez Perces, friends of the white man,
who ask through me that they be allowed
to return 10 our oid home in Idaho.
There are 1000 of my tribe in Idaho, and
we in Washington wish to join them, so
the tribe may remain as one body. It
took me a long time to come here, and six
days I have been in Washineton. There
I saw General Miles and shook his hand.
I made a speech to him and another to a
man named Bliss, who is Secretary, who
shall say whether the Nez Perces may die
in their old Homes or in a new and strange
place. I told him the wishes of the tribe
and tbat they are all good Indians and
have bowed down before the white man,
never to take arms against him again.
"I made a speech to the Indian Com
missioner, telling him all these things.
They are my fr ends and will do what
they can. They told me Congress author
ized the first act, and so the Nez Perces
will have to wait a while. It matters lit
tle, though, if we can join our people in
Idaho. I think it will be so. for I, who
have oeen the friend of the white man for
twenty years, am pleading for them. The
white man has won all he has and from
haiinz him we have come to love him.
There were too many whites for the In
dians to rule, so the whites won the In
dian's place. It is ail over no^. Things
have settled themselves and we are at
peace and satisfied."

SIR JULIAN IS
VERY PARTICULAR
Refuses to Take a Seat
Further Back Than
Hobart.
But a Scheme Is Arranged to
Placate the Embassador
From England.
Diplomats at the Grant Monument
Services to Ba Treated as "Dis
tinguished Spectators."
WASHINGTON, D. G. April 22.â Sir
Julian Pauocefote is 10 be placated, the
dignity of the Vice-Presidenial office
maintained snd the State Department j
made happy. After all the fuss over |
whether Sir Juiian or the Vice- President I
shall sit to the rieht or Jeft of President
MrKinley at the Grant monument cere
monies the department has evaded the I
important question of precedence and left
it to be st-ttied at some future ofheial oc
casiou â di&tantly future, the department
hopes. The evasion in the form of the
1 temporary expedient is intended to please
everyoody. Whether everybody will be
pleased is another story, to be told after
the ceremonies are over. Just how far Sir
Julian appeared in the controversy has
not been fully explained. But certainly
Secretary Sherman and some of the State
Department officials have been deeply
concerned and willing to grasp anything
affording an opportunity for a harmonious
settlement.
That opportunity presented itself to-day
at the weekly diplomatic reception. One
of the Embassadors or Ministers, exactly
who is not known, made the suggestion,
apparently in behalf of the diplomatic
corps. His plan for settlement was in the
: form of a compromise. He suggested that
i the tirst point involved whether the four
Embassadora to the United States as per
sonal representatives of their sovereigns
should be ahead of the Vice-President in
the principal parade, be disposed of by
leaving the entire diplomatic corps out of
the line, allowing them to proceed to
Riverside Park as a separate contingent,
just as they go to the Cai>itol on inaugura
tion days, and that the other and more
embarrassing question :ibout seating Ho
bart and the Embassadors be arranged by
giving the diplomats positions as "distin
guished spectators," not as official func
tionaries.
Just how Sir Julian views the temporary
expedient is unknown. He denied today
that he maJe a protest about the question
of precedence. "Some oi the Embassa
dor's friends," to quote a published state
ment headed by Bif Julian's denial, have
also bad something to say. These anony
mous "friends'" declare the report that Sir
Julian did not attend the dinner given by
the venerable Gardiner Hubbard because
the Vtce-Pre.si.;ent was to have the place
of honor is untrue. As it is positively known
that Sir Juiian did raise a question of
precedence on that occasion and would
not attend because Hobart was put ahead
of him at the table the denials are viewed
with surprise. Sir Juiian is a very hearty,
distinguished looking English gentleman
who has made himself very popular here,
but there are some people in official soci
ety who resent any attempt of a foreign
representative to claim a position of
greater importancp taan the Vice-Presi
dent.
Gentlemen who have been acquainted
with every phase of the controversy said
to-day ihatunjess something unexpected
happened Sherman would write to the
Grant Monument Committee explaining
bow the Vice-President and Embassadors
should be located. If Sir Julian is agree
able there will b? no further trouble.
Hobart will sit with McKinley in the offi -
cials' seats, and the diplomatic corps will
he placed in the space devoted to the "dis
tinguished spectators," with Sir Julian in
the place of honor. This arrangement,
however, makes it necessary that every
body concerned shall shut their eyes to
the fact that foreign Governments were
invited to participate in the ceremonies.
But diplomacy is not unused to such ex
pedients. _^^^^^^^^^^^

IN LOS ANGELES
Pageants of Floats and
Flowers Adorned
the Night.
Dazzling Allegories Were Pic
tured in Gilt and
Tinsel.
Immense Crowds Witnessed a
Moving Spectacle of Great
Beauty.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 22.â The
street pageant by night was the feature of
. the third day of the festival, though the
hours of daylight were not allowed 10 es
cape unoccupied by the revelers. The
afternoon was devoted to athletic, games
at the parK which were attended and
graced by the royal party. BPH
The pageant to-night was an unusally
beautiful spectacle, being maintained
throughout on a high plan of strictly ar
tistic creations on wheels. It was com
posed of sixteen floats designed to tell the
"Legend of the Flowers." No other fea
tures were permitted in the line, there be
ing besides them only the commander-in
chief and his aides, the caballeros serving
as an escort to the commandant, the com
manders of the several divisions and their
aids, and then the music, consisting of a
liberal sprinkling of brass bauds through
ont the line.
To this, of course, must be added the
Queen and her court, to whom all street
parades are supposed to serve as an
escort.
The floats were all poetical conceptions,
carried out on lines that seemed to give no
thought to either space or expense. Some
of them were immense affairs. They were
drawn by processions of horses in white
coverings, e3Ch horse being attended by a
footman in mask and domino. On each
side marched torchbearers, while at the
four corners were still others, burning
Greek fire. With the liberal illumination
of the streets with electric lights the gild
ing and tinsel that made so large a part of
the decoration of the floats glittered and
flashed in dazzling lashion.
The amphitheater at the tribunes was
lit up with arc lights until darkness of
night was entirely dispelled. Th? tribunes
were fairly well rilled with spectators and
the scene there was one worth traveling
far to see. But the throng gathered there
seemed scarcely to be missed from the
streets. Along the entire line of march,
which was an unusually long one, people
were n.assed solidly along the sidewalks,
and they also occupied windows, steps
and every available i-pnce. Where they
came irom would have been a hard ques
tion to answer. At every step of the way
each of the floats was applauded enthusi
astically.
The spectacle was under command of
Grand Marshal Madison T. Owens, who
was accompanied by a number of aids.
The Seventh Regiment band led tbe way
and immediately following the marshal
came the ever-iascinating caballeros, un
der command of J. C. Cline.
TiiÂ«> line of march extended from the
tribunes east on Twelfth street to Olive,
north on Olive to Ninth street, east on
Ninth street to Broadway, north on
Broadway to First street, east on Fir-t
street to Spring, south on Spring to Fifth
street, east on Fifth street to Main, north
on Main street to Commercial, counter
marching south on Main and Spring to
First street, west on First to Broadway,
on Broadway and Main to Washington
Gardens.
The first division was in command of
Co. one! M. M. Ogden, marshal, with his
aids. It was composed of four floats,
representing as many flowers â the morn
ing elory, the night blooming cereus, the
lady's slipper and the white rose.
The scheme of the spectacle was to
typify the flower by a tableau represent
ing a legend with which it, or at least its
name, is popularly identified. The aurora
borealis, lor instance, was made to repre
sent the glory of the morning, the morn
ing glory. Renis' celebrated painting
"Aurora and Phoebus" was utilized as the
portrayal. The Goddess of Day ap
peared in an open cold chariot, her at
tendants scattering flowers in her path.
Cupid, with burning torch, led the way,
tipping the clouds with silver. Morning
glories entwined the base of the car in a
Â»ea of sky-blue bloom. The characters in
the float were: Aurora, Miss LeotaStoney,
attendants, Miss Kate Chapton, Miss
Stella Chapton, Miss Ekman.
The night-blooming cereus was typified
by the Queen of the Night seated upon the
earth in a throne of stars. The Queen
â¢was robed in indigo-blue drnperies,
spangled with stars. Tue effects were all
of moonlight â a glow-worm, a bat, fire
flies and night birds. In the front of the
lloat was a magnificent open flower
sprung from a bed of cacti, the leaves and
prickly arms draping the body of the
float. The characters en this float were j
taken as follows: Cinderella, Norma Gra- '
ham; heralds, E. Ryder. R. J. Hanchette;
Prince, Walter C. Fogg; waiting-maids'
Maude Tinklepaugh, Lizzie Cuinmiugs.
The white rose followed. It was histori
cally the best known of the many badges
of the house of York, and was typified
In the float representing two historical
scene?. One was a garden scene where
Edward, the Duke of York, with Elizabeth
Woodville, is listening to the court jester.
In the second scene Richard, the young
est brother and last of the house or Plan
lagenet, is leaving the castle lor a fight
with Warwick. He is just crossing the
drawbridge, attended by knights and men
at-arms. On the base of the float were
armorial insignia and hereditary emblems
of the house of York. The characters
were as follows: Duke of York, A. L. j
Fowler; man-at-arms, Joe Goldsmith; â¢
i 'ester, Aubrey Austin; court ladies â Paul
Siliott, Alice Winchester: sentinel, Harry
Gregg.
The second division was in charge of
Ralph D.>m!ngULZ, marshal, and aids,
with the Li: Angeles military band. It
comprised floats representing the pansy,
ruarguerite, pond lily and the papyrus.
The pansy was represented by a scene
from "A Midsummer Night's Dream." in
which dew, moonshine, glittering insects,
little genii with butterflies, and many
colored flower-* filled a fairy world. Un
der an immense mushroom Bottom and
Titania are standing, she paying him
tender homage with a coronet of flowers.
Puck, the mad-cap sprite, "borne like the
light and glittering gossamer before the
breeze," was near. Glow-worms, moths,
fireflies, beetles and grasshoppers .form
the f&iiy court. At the base was a sea oi i
pansies rich wiih the colors of purple and I
gold. The characters for this scene were I
taken by Charles Ashlev as Faust; Mc
l h'sto, Victor Pollard; Marguerite, Miss
Michaels.
And now the proud lily. A scene from
"lolantbe" was pictured in this float. It
was a water scene of lairy magnificence.
Out of an enormous pond lily rose
lolantne alter her twenty years' Imprison
ment. Around her were .grouped the
Earl of TolJailer, Phyllis, the L;rd Chan
cellor and Strephoii. Upon a rock was
enthroned a queen of the fairies, holding
her wand and awakening lolanthe from
her lily bed. Conventionalized lilies
formed the base of the float. The charac- j
ters were taken by: lolanthe. Katharine I
K*Â»adall; queen of fairies, Mabel Hay- I
wark; fairies â E;la A. Stone, Susie
S. ringer.
Papyrus, the plant which, centuries
ago, tiie Egyptians used as paper, told its
legend in a chapter of history taken at
tbat fateful time when Cleopatra first met
MarK Anthony upon the nver Cydnus.
The float represented the Egyptian
Queen in her barge of state, covered over
with a pavilion-cloth of gold tissue, with
silken sails and gay festoons. At the
nelm were mermaids; around her were
slaves. Thd barge was a blaze of magnifi
cent color, surrounded by papyrus and
water plants*. Ttie characters "were sus
tained as follows: Captain, Miss Gertie
Johnson: fan-bearers, Mis* Aletcalf, Miss
Flora Benedict; rowers â G. W. Yonsen,
Jay Andrews, J. C. Cull. Jacob Herbs:;
musicians â Miss Hermia Packer, Miss Ma
mie Goodwin.
Captain Solano, marshal and aids, bad
the third division with the Pasadena
Dand. The floats represented the laurel,
cactus, stiaudragon ana gold of ophir.
The laurel was represented by a tableau
in whicn the victor in the Olympian
games is being crowned. A Greek tem
ple, severely classical, was pictured as
surrounded by cypress trees; before it a
proup of athletes were returning iroai the
games; beiore them, upon a Greek pedes
tal, burned the sacred fires. Upon the
steps of me temple stood the victorious
athlete in the act of receiving the c aplet
ot victory at the hands oi the judges. Tlie
whole float was surrounded by laurel
leaves.
The characters were represented as fol
lows: Victor, G. A. BarKer; Judge, M. C.
Van Leuven; guests, J. O. Wiltony, W. E.
Lyman and J. E. Blorrell; boy, Y. Figue
roa; spectators, J. R. l>otialdson and P. G.
Jones; woman, M. M. Burns.
The cactvs was symbolized in a scene
from Mexico, in wuich Montezuma is
being tarried io the great temple by six
men. He is attended by ins guards. The
great temple was encrusted with stucco,
richly sculptured. A fetich was seen upon
the side of the temple. In the center of
the float was the sacrific:al stone, wiih
figures and em biems carved upon it. On
the sides were Aztecs, kneeling down and
worshiping tLe image of the sun king.
The cnaracteis were: Moniezurna, J. J.
Murphy; bearers, Robert Jones, John
Cain, Hubert Robinson, Theodore Hoff, C.
H. Wade and T. J. McDonald; musician,
Loring Gates.
The snap-dragon was symbolized by
the great dragon, the sea monster killed
by Perseus the gorgon slayer, in rescuing
Andromeda, whom Cepheus chained io
the rock to appease the deities. The float
was simply a huge dragon, twenty feet in
length, with wings fifteen feet wide. The
dragon was walking over the rocks in pur
suit of Andromeda, her face hid, her
tresses afloat in the water. P-.-rseus on
horseback, with drawn sword, was in the
act ot slaying the monster. The dragon
was in green and blue lights, with purpie
scaies and Haming nostrils. L. A. Haruill
personated Perseus, aad Miss Nellie D.ck
enson Andromeda.
Gold of Ophir was represented in a page
from Rider Haggard's "She,"' the moment
when Hoiiy and Leo discovered the
witch's head. The float itself was the
Ethiopian head, with thick lips, terrifying
eyes and heavy cheeks. Poetic license is
taken with the story for spectacular effect,
as She appeared on the rock, in snowy
robes, sandaled feet, hair of raven black
ness, and a face of unearthly beauty.
Peering over the rock she gazed at the two
men below in the boat. In the foreground
were the hot pots, molten and full of red
fires that lighted up the scene. Gold of
Ophir roses formed the base of the float.
Tne characters: Devitici, George A. Beat;
Holly, Thomas E. McGinn; Sue, Miss A.
Levy; Old Man, L. A. Coburn; savages,
Charley Moon and Gai. Moon.
The fourth and last division was in
command of C. A. Sumner, marshal, and
aids; Catalina bands; float, Poppy Kelp;
Orange City band; floats â Chrysanthe
mums, tDe Poppy, the Sea Kelp and
Holly.
The Poppy float, the Stale flower, pre
sented a scene from Tennyson's "Sleep
ing Palace." Under a scarlet satin canopy
Jay the sleeping beauty. Spider-webs
swung from the hanging lamp and around
the palace on every hand. Sleep possessed
the mai-1 of honor, the page, the builer
and the Kinc. Before the princess stood
trie fairy prince. "He stooped to
kiss her â on his knees," and the charm
was broken.
All around the base of the float poppies
were blooming in riotous magnificence.
The night effect of this float was very
beautiful. Following was the cast of char
ac;ers: Princess, Mi-s Carrie Zurcher;
Captain Prince, T. E. P:ror; sentinels,
Hector Bouttier, George J. Oden; at
tendants, Miss Rosalind Hughes, Miss
Alice Truit.
Kelp gave opportunity for another sub
marine scene full of sea effects. Nep
tune with trident in hand sat upon a
throne of pink and white coral. Two
mermaids reclined upon the wreck of the
â¼essel below the surface of the water.
Near them a sunken chest scattered
gold and jewels upon the bottom of tne
sea, while coral, sea fan, kelp and other
sea plants were in full motion.
The whole float was supposed to be un
der water, and the night effects added
greatly to its beauty. The characters:
Neptune, B. \V. Steinhart; Mermaids,
Edmund Duncommun, W. H. Mecke.
The chrysanthemum, the flower of
Japan, told its story in a scene from act II
in "The Mikado." The artist used the
poet's license in the song "The Moon and
I," and has placed Yum Yum swinging
lightly in "he silver crescent of the young
moon in Ko Ko's gardens. Pitti-Sing and
80- Peep were near her. A Japanese villa
was in the distance and the garden was
full of vases of riotous foliage.
Tne whole base of the float was of blaz
ing chrysanthemums. The two effects of
day and night were in the scene. The
character* were taken as follows: Yum
Yum, Miss Young; Nanki Poo, Mr. Han
chette; attenrlanis, Mrs. Duncan, Miss
King, Miss Brambilla.
And Jam of all came Santa Claus, rep
resenting the Christmas holly. He was
preparing his sledge and reindeer for his
Christmas mission.
An immense iceberg was at one end of
the float, which was spanned by the au
rora boreahs, resplendent in rose, gold
and Â«ilver and rainbow-hued lights. The
reflection of the aurora in the water and
the icebergs gave play for nitrht effects
and color. The base of the float was in
holly leaves. Charles Howe personated
Santa Ciaus.
To-morrow will witness two great dis
plays â the floral parade in the afternoon
and the water carnival and fireworks at
Westlake Park.
SPOKTS AT THE I' ARK.
Jiurli-ftqur Exhibition*, Athletic ctntett*
and Hie i dr. liner* He/ore HnynHy.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 22 âThe
center of attraction shifted to Athletic
P*rt this afternoon, where a highly di
versified programme of sports engaged
the attention of many thousands of 'spec
tators.
Royalty eraced the occasion by its pres
ence. Her Majesty Queen Francesca came
accompanied, as hitherto, by her retinue
of court ladies, prime minister and other
functionaries, entering the luclosure soon
after 2 o'clock. Calmly indifferent to his
torical solecisms, her Majesty and her
court had divested themselves of the pic
turesque garb of the eighteenth century
and substituted that of the present day as
one perhaps better adapted to the warmth
of a Los Angeles spring. Variety, how
ever, is invariably acceptable, and the
natural charms of the Queen and her la
dies can well dispense .with the artificial
assistance of powder and patches.
Prior to ascending the handsome and
richly canopied dais reserved for her con
venience the Queer, and t he entire cortege
passed in 1 stately procession twice around
the inciosure, her Majesty gracefully bow
ing hi r acknowledgments and waving a
handkerchief in response to the prolonged
ripple of applause with which she was
everywhere greeted by her devoted sub
jects. Then, while the band played an
appropriate measure and escorted by
Prime Minister Thomas, s-ht proceeded
from her carriage to the dais, a white
carpet having been previously spread be
tween the two. The remaining carriages,
with their freight of female loveliness,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 23, 1807.
followed one by one, Â»nd, everything
being in readiness, ber Majesty, through
her Prime Minister, declared it her
pleasure ibat the sports should proceed
forthwith.
If a fault could be found with the subse
quent programme it was that a multiplic
ity of entertaining features proved almost
bewildering. Thus, while the cyclists and
sprinters competed in deadly earnest for
tangible trophies and the royal favor the
members ot the Los Angeles Athletic
Club, fantastically arrayed, were frivo
lously engaged in acrobatic and humorous
business in the center of the field to the
inter.se delight of the onlookers.
The iwo clowns, Ben Boaner and Fay
Stepbenson, were huge succesÂ»es, and me
exciting debut of the club's iamous baud
oi Zulus, imported direct from Africa tor
the occasion, created quite a sensation.
These dusky warriors were completely
armed with assegais, shields and six-shoot
ers, and in tne exuberance oi their holi
day spirits proceeded to kill each other as
rapidly as possible early in the day. They
were afterward resurrected, however, anil
again startled the spectators by a well
executed series of pyramid and tumbling
specialties.
The club German band incidentally har
rowed the souls of its hearers in the
course of a burlesque parade around the
field. The midget policemen followed
closely in its wake and were generously
applauded. Among ttie many other en
lermining specialties contributed by the
members of the club were wrestling and
boxing bouts by Messis. L. Tascuet and
Frank Sentous, N. T. Forsyth and S. J.
Brown, M. Graham and Harry Porter, M.
Micbelsou and F. N. Lord, Harry Maeder
and Alfred Maeder.
The two most important events of the
day were the amateur and professional
mile Queen's championship bicycle races,
which were won respectively by Ralph
Hamlin and Charles W. Stimson, W. S.
Furman and A. T. Bell being second in
each case. Prooably the proudest moment
of their lives was that in which they were
called upon to approach the royal dais
and receive the reward of their prowess
lrom the hands of the Prime Minister, the
Queen smiling her approbation. Hamlin
and Furman had to compete against
hfteen rivals and were closely pressed in
their respective heats by D. B. Cromwell
and F. G. Lacy. The third hea>, which
contained neither 01 the final winners, fell
to H. B. Cromwell and M. A. Casenave.
The time for the final was 2:20 2-5, which
was better than the 2:261-5 of the first
heat and the 2:27 of the third, and not so
good as the 2:17 of the second.
The mile proiessional brought out four
starters only, ia marked contrast to the
congested amateur field. Stinison was an
easy winner in 2:16 1-5, with A. T. Bell
second and A D. Tonipkins third. Both
races were admirably contested, and liap
pily unmarked by any serious casualties,
though in the third heai of the amateur
contest A. J. Gordon of Pomona, who had
a good chance to win, fell in rounding the
bank during the last lap, and involved
boih Rot-en Campbell and A. L. Taber in
the spill. All three escaped injury, and
Campbell lecovered in lime to finish
third.
Another excellent race was the two
mile amateur handicap, which W. Broth
i erton, at the 75-yard ma r k, won by a
splendid spurt. Time, 4:43 2-5. D. B.
Cromwell, at 50 yards, was second; F. <;.
Lacy, scratch, third; W. G. Furman, 100
yards, fourth, and A. L. Caidwell, 75
yards, fifth. H. B. Cromwell, the second
scratch man, was out of tue race.
P. G. Lacy won the mile-lap amateur in
2:27 2-10 with thirteen points, H. B. Croni
weil being second and W. It. Ruess third.
Charles W. Stinison won the two-mile
lap professional in 5:49, with A. T. Be2l
second and A. D. Tom pk ins third.

ASSASSINATED AT CALABASAS.
Michael Lorden, a Weil-Known Merchant,
Is Murdered Under Mysterious
Circumstances.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. April 22.â Michael
Lorden, a well-known merchant of Cala
basas. a mountain settlement north of
Pasadena, was brutally murdered at his
place of business last night.
As near as can be learned of the crime,
Lorden was in his store, near the cash
drawer, about 8:30 o'clock. Without
warning of any kind, a weapon, pre
sumably a rifle, was discharged from out
side the door, and Lorden fell to the floor,
shot in the stomach. He managed to get
up and make his way to a neighbor, about
a quarter of a mile distant, and teil of
the occurrence. Lorden then started
back, and when close to his store fell ex
hausted, where the neighbor discovered
him. The neighbor assisted Lorden to
the store, where he s on died.
The officers are puzzled for a motive for
the crime. It was not apparently for tne
purpose of robbery, as nearly $40 was
found in the money-drawer, and the place
had not been disturbed. Owing to the
remote situation of Caiabasas and distance
from telegraphic or telephone communi
cation, but few details of trie affair can be
learned. Telephonic communication was
secured with Chatsworth Park, but little
was known there of the tragedy.
Sheriff B irr received notification of the
crime early this morning from the latter
place and immediately detailed Under
Sheriff Clement and Deputy Sheriff Guv
Woodward to investigate. They left in a
buggy for the noene of the killing.
Coroner Campbell a. so went to hold an
inquest.

Nevada City Selected as the I
Place for the Next En
campment.
General Chlpman Satd to Be Lead

SALINAS, Cal., [April 22.â Every vet
eran of the Grand Army encampment to
nigiit is sounding the praises of Salinas,
which is a go-ahead city in the way of
handling visitors. The school children,
as a feature of patriotic demonstration
and parade, surpassed everything that
haa ever been seen at former encamp
ments. State cr Na.ional.
Nothing happ-ned to mar the pleasure
of the grand parade and review. The
weather was perfect. Promptly at the
hour appointed, 11 o'clock this morning,
the column, escorted by Captain Uurke's-
Troop C, National Guards, moved. At
eyery block along the beautifully decora
ted streets a new and delightful surprise
was unfolded to the sight of the march
ing veteraus. Seven hundred school
children, marshaled in live battalions,
were lined up on Capital street. The chil
dren saluted the veterans, sans songs of
greeting in chorus, waved flags ana
aroused an enthusiasm in the Grand
Army column that spread to the vast
throng of spectators, causing cheers to re
echo along the entire line.
This ieature of itself was admirable
I enough, but the sight of the moving bat
| talions of cnildren as they couuter
i marched in front of the reviewing stand
| oa Main strett was what excited the great
! est enthusiasm.
First came the girls of the High School
wuh Japanese shades or parasols, then the
boys in white uniform and straw hats
headed by the school drum corps. The
boys of Lincoln School bore a banner con
taining a likeness of Lincoln, which was
cheered again and again. The girls of the
Grammar School, with white and blue
sashes and mortar-board hats of red,
white and blue topped with stars, made a
I most creditable display. The crowning
feature of the whole scene \va3 that ex
hibited by the "tots>" of Washington Pri
mary School. They maintained their even
places in line by holding in their hand
streamers running the entire length of
the battalion. In front of the reviewing
stand, where the badges glittereJ, the
little ones were halted to sing "America,''
then they knelt down in the roaiiway of
Wie straet and in cnorus invoked thetavor
of heaven to preserve the country and
the Mag.
The veterans of the war and the lady
veterans of thir:y peaceful encampmens
were deep y moved. The emotion pro
duced in me ranks of tne Woman's Relief
Corps and in the circles of the Ladies of
the Grand Army has not yet subsided.
All assert that it was the most impres
sive an ft beautiful spectacle that they ever
saw. The excellence of the marching,
the grading of the children according to
size, and the precision witn wnich the
youn? Jady teachers bandied their respec
tive commands was a common topic of
comment. Comrades from San Francisco
exclaimed: "Look at that object lesson
and fancy San Francisco giving features
to a procession. 'Ibis is out of sight. In
all our encampments nothing has equaled
this feature. Salinas has carried off the
honor*."
Tne 80ns of Veterans, while not numer
ically *troncr,:enlisted considerable cheer
ine. Frequent cheers were given for the
Veteran Guard and loud huzzas for Troop
b, National Guard of California, an or
ganization of which Salinas is proud.
To view the parade people came from
Monterey, Pacific Grove, Castroviiie, Wat
sonville, Gilroyand from places a hundred
miles distant. It was a great day on the
plains of Salinas, showing that the growth
of patriotism and the development of the
beet-sugar industry go hand in hand.
THE LATE JUDGE W. S. HOLMAN of Indiana, the "Great
Objector."
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 22 âRep
resentative Holman of Indiana died at 2
o'clock this afternoon. He bad been ill
with spinal meningitis for some weeks.
William Steele Holman was a native of
Indiana and 75 years of ape. The year he
was 21 be was elected Judge of Probate,
and four years later Prosecuting Attorney.
He served a term in the Legislature in
1851-52, and from 1852 to J856 was Judge of
the Court of Common Pleas. In 1856 lie
was tirst elected to represent his d;sirict
in Congress. He was nominated eighteen
times and suffered but four defeats â in
1*54, 1876. 1878 and 1894. Long, long ago
Judge Holnian earned the title oi the
"great objecior" and "watchdog of the

position to every plan of the Republicans
in which the expenditure of money played
any prominent part. It is not true, as has
What surprisÂ°s every one is the number |

The Department Encampment held a
session to-day, lasting from 2 o'clock until
5. An effort to proceed to the election of
department commander was made with
some vigor, but it failed. It was decided
to make that matter the special oraer for
to-morrow Rt 9a. m. The leading candi
dates are General N. P. Chipman of Red
Bluff, Frank Miller of Sacramento and F.
D. Cusbiue of Jlameda. To-night it
seems almost a cerm.ntv that General
Cnipman will carry off the honors.
For some time he was in doubt as to
whether he could lind time to attend to
the duties of the portion, but he haa now
made up his mind to talie iho time. His
address at ttie opara-house last night pro
duce i a good impression.
Navada Cry was selected as the
place for holding the encampment in
1898. San Diego delegates gave notice
tu at they would claim the encampment in
1899 as a matter of r ght. Judge Walling
read oflic al invitations f-om the Trustees
of Nevada City, the Board of Trade and
also tne Board of Supervisors of Nevada

NO LONGER HOPE
FOR THE SAMARIA
A Life-Preserver From
the Luckless Ship
Picked Up.
The Tell-Tale Relic Found a
Few Miles North of
Astoria.
Circumstances That Recall tho
Fate of the Cadzow
Forest.
ASTORIA, Or., April 22.â Any donbt
that might have existed in the minds of
shipping men a? to the fate of the bark
Samaria, which left Seattle on March 21
for San Francisco, with a carpo of coal,
was settled this afternoon, when Post
master English, of the town cf Long
Beach, Wash., twenty miles north of this
city, picked up a life-preserver on which
was painted the words "Samaria."
The buoy had drifted down the coast,
and evidently came from near I'npe
Flattery. To all appearances it had
The United States Revenue Cutter Richard Rush as She Appeared When on Her Search for th<
Missing American Ship Samaria*
been in the water for some time. Post
master English reported the find to the
authorities.
It is the general opinion of local ship
ping men that the Samaria went down
with all on board north of Cape Flattery,
as a wreck south of that point would have
attracted attention before this.
The loss of the Samaria has a precedent
in the mysterious disappearance of the
British ship Cadzow Forest, which ar
rived off the river last fall. A gale sprung
up ana the vessel was driven to the north.
No trace of the ship was ever afterward
discovered. She probably went down at
sea north of Cape Flattery, and local ship
ping men think the Samaria met a like
fate.
The most feasible solution of the mys
tery is that the Samaria was overturned,
or else tbat she sprung a leak and found
ered, as no other trace has been discovered.
She was out thirty-one days to-day.
Tbe Samaria was a wooden vessel of
1439 net tonnage. She was built in 1876
by Houghton Bros, at Bath, Me. Her
dimensions were: Length 217.6, breadth
39.1, depth 24.1.
The ship was commanded by Cuptain
McÃae, wio, at the time o: the vessel's
logs â if she has foundered, as is presumed â
was accompanied by his wife and two
minor ciiidren. Captain McÃae bore the
repntion of being a skillful navigator;
but, as the Samaria was always considered
stanch enough to weather the fiercest oi
gales, her loss is the subject of much
speculation and conjecture among sea
faring men.
RETURN OF THE RUSH.
Not Even a Trace of the Mlsslnar
Vessel Is Found by the
Cutter.
The fates teem to favor the idea that the
American ship Samaria has gone to the
bottom. The revenue cutter Rush re
turned from her cruise in search of the
missing vessel yesterday, but brought no
news. The schooner Liilebonne from Port
Hadlock for Port Costa reported having
seen a square-rigger off the straits of San
Juan de Fuca. The weather was very
heavy and the bbip was apparently in
trouble.
Captain Hunter of the steamer Umatilla
is of the opinion that the revenue cutter
did not go far enough north, "For the
last two voyages," said be, "the wind from
Flattery to Blanco has been southeast.
Now, taking it for granted that the Sama
ria was disabled or dismantled, fhe would
naturally drift north. Say tbat it was the
missing vessel tbat was spoken off the
Columbia Kiver with her mainmast
sprung, then by this time she would be
away north of Flattery, judging from the
winds and currents. I don't think there
is any hope for the vessel, but 1 do tnink
that in a week or 50 the Indians will bring
news from the crew."
The Rush went at least 200 miles north
of Cape Mendocino. A zigzag course was
taken on the way home, but no signs of
the missing vessel could be found. On
the 17th inst., in latitude 40 23 north,
longitude 127.06 west, the schooner
Haosor from Port Townsend for Guaymas,
eleven days out, was spoken, She bad
neither seen nor heard of the Samaria. A
day later the schooner- Lillebonne, seven
days out from Port Hadlock for Port
Costa, was spoken with the same result.
On the 20th. in latitude 41.40 north,
loneltude 126.04 west, the senroner Se
quoia from Grays Harbor for San Diego
was hailed, and a day later a boat's crew
wa"*j sent aboard the G. W. Watson, Irom
Tacoma for San Pedro, in search of infor
mation.
CapUta Roberta reports that he tig
zaeged up the coast to 16 west. In 44.302
north very foul weather was encountered,
but during the remainder of the trip it
was pleasant.
The schooner Meiaucthon and the bark
Carondelet, bound for San Francisco, were
spoken last Wednesday. Not one of them
had seen anytning of tne missing ship, so
the Rush returned to port. Shipping men
are still of tho opinion that news will come
from the Snmaria before the month is out.
They contend that the vessel was <lismast
ed off the Columbia and the prevailing
winds drove tier north paÂ«t Vancouver
Island. In the circumstances, as they
place them, there could bs no chance of
the Samaria being spoken oy vessels south
bound and no news wouid reach San
Francisco. Istill the general belief is that
the coliier weiit down in tne heavy gale
that prevailed along tne Oregon coast a
month ago.

SAN QUENTIN, Cal., April 22.â About
forty convicts, dressed in their prison
clothes, marched behind the remains of
W. K. Kelly, who was yesterday killed by
a fellow-convict during an altercation
over oDium. The funeral procession filed
out of the main door of the prison, the
coffin beiuc carried on a stretcncr by six
convicts. The procession then marched
around the prison into the cemetery,
where, after a simple service, the casket
was lowered into the ground.
Coroner Eden of San Rafael held an in
quest over the remains at the prison this
morning. Nothing beyond what has al
ready been published was brought out.
Dr. Lawlor, the resident physician, said
to-night that there are chances for the re
covery of Frank Wheeler, who was stabbed
in the abdomen by Kelly. The prisoner
is very low, but has improved somewhat,
leading the doctor to believe that there
may be hope for his recovery.
THRIPS ATTACK
FRESNO'S VINES
Threaten to Destroy the
Coming Crop of
Crapes.
All Efforts to Eradicate the
Pest Seem to Be of
No Avail.
Professor Woodworth Making a !
Careful Study of the
Situation.
FRESNO, Cal., April 22.â Professor C.
W. Woodworth of the State University is
actively engaged in conducting investiga
tions among the vineyards hereabout with
a view to finding some effectual way of
exterminating the tbrips or vinehoppers,
which are threatening to destroy the com
ing crop of grapes. He has not yet found
a satisfactory remedy and is vigorously
prosecuting hi- work. The hoppers at
present are infesting only vineyards in
certain sections. They seem to be migra
tory, however, and there is danger that
they will spread over the entire vine
growing district. The investigations and
experiments by the college expeit are be
ing watched with the greatest interest by
the farmers, and they appreciate very
much the efforts of the professor in their
behalf.
Professor "Woodwortb is of the opinion
tbat the vinehoppera feed all winter, ex
\ cept in extreme cold weather, on every
-1 thing they can iind digestible. The insect
is dormant or active according to the !
temperature. The first young will appear
about two weeks hence. They lay eggs all
, season and have two or three crops of
| young. The feeding of the rests varies ac
j cording to their activity. In the winter
i they eat little, but in the spring they feed
I ravenously to develop eggs. Tbe pests in-
I sert the proboscis into the plant and suck
out the sap and green matter of tne ]
vine.
Professor Woodworth believes that the
I eggs are inserted in the leaves of tbe
I vines. The epgs are not in the ground.
I The coming crop of young will be the off
spring of the thrips that remain over
from last summer through the winter.
I Eggs do not endure the winter, Only the
adults survive the cold, and from them
spring the young of the first crop of the
season. Sheep pasturage in the vine
yards, therefore, does not affect the crop.
' Professor Woodworth has not yet ar
rived at a decision as to tbe bÂ»st treat
ment lor destroying the pestÂ«. There are
three ways under considerationâ by spray
ing, application of some sticky substance,
or by catching the flying insects with nets. I
He considers the last named the best of |
the three. There is a possibility, but no
probability, says tbe professor, that the
hoppers may disappear from some un
| known disease. Barring the threatened
injury from the thrips the indications are
that the crop of grapes this season will be
the largest ever known.
Mr. Porter, in discussing. the situation,
said; "I really believe that the peit will
â ..-â â ..-â  â  - -â  J
f *

be of great injury to the entire crape crop
unless some means is discovered very soon
to check it."
VINE PEST SPREADING.
Thrlps Will Make a Great Differ
ence In the Fresno County
Grape Crop.
From all acconnts received in this City
the vine pest, known as thrips, of Fresno
is causing the Tineyardists of that county
great uneasiness and is even alarming
those of tho adjoining counties. A. W.
Porter of Porter Brothers Company is in
receipt of several communications from
that part of the State and from appear
ances the entire grape crop stands in
danger of being destroyed. Ho had a
communication over tho telephone yes
terday with J. F. Niekirk of Malaga, four
miles from Fresno, in which Mr. Niekirk
stated thai the hopper pest is spreading
every day.
So far, the centleman stated, nothing
has been discovered to check it. The
neighboring vineyards have been at
tacked and the bright young leaves droop
and fall as though a tire baa passed over
the vines. At the rate the pest is spread
ing it will not take long before it works
itself into the adjoining counties. Cut
worms, the regular grasshopper and such
insects have been encountered and de
feated, but the tbripisa mystery to all.
In one of the letter* received by Mr.
Porter from Hobbs, Parsons *fc Co. of
Fresno, dated April 20, the writer says:
There is quite a scare among the growers
over the vinebuu that is doing considerable
injury at the present time. I presume you
have seen accounts to the papers. Tuereis no
doubt they will cut off the crop some, but to
what extent it is hard to telL

SAN RAFAEL, Cal., April 22. â A
prize- fight took place here last night be-
tween two lads well known about town.
It lasted five rounds and was fought in a
barn just back of tbe San Rafael Convent.
A num'er of spectators wi nested the
affair. Tae lads are aged 18 and 20, re
spectively, and the five rounds furnished
the visitors considerable amusement.
Skin-tight gloves were used, and another
light is scheduled for the near future.

from the universities will witness both
events.
Tbe question for debate was submitted
by Berkeley and reads: "Resolved, That
each member of the Cabinet should have
a seat and a voic -in Congress." Stanford
had the choice of sides and selected tbe
negative, contrary to her custom in former
debate". The wearers of the blue and
gold will be represented by Charles C.

M. Hurt zer and A. B. Morgan are (o up
bold the cardinal.
Both universities bave won two debates
and the tiftb match will be hotly con
tested. The Stanford team has received
special attention this year, and if they tail
to win the decision of judge* it will not be
because of any lack of thorough prepara

KLOSS' DAY OF DOOM.
On tkÂ» Brink of the Scaffold tha Mur
derer Oisp/c/s the Utmost In
diffsrenca.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Cal., April
-2 â Murderer Frank C. Kloss, who will
be haugeJ to-morrow morning, spent his
last day on earth with the same show of
contempt that has characterized his
actions from the time be was brought to
the prison convicted of an atrocious mur
der. To-night he is writing a letter to his
mother, and though he has not. an
other day to live he shows not the slight
est sign of iear. To-day he was visited by
his two brothers and bro her-in-law. The
latter asked him what message he wished
delivered to his girl, and the murderer re-
Jjlied:
"Tell her she is no good. You had
b?tter have nothing to do with women.
The old hens will get you in the same
pace as I."
Those in the prison who have been
brought into contact with the condemned
man say that he is one of the boldest
and coolest criminals they have ever
dealt with. Father Lagan was with the
prisoner this afternoon for some time.
This evening Kloss made a statement
to The Call representative in which he
said that he wished to deny ihe story
published in the Chronicle in regard to
the manner in which he treated nib
mother when she visited him at the
prison.
'â¢The story is a lie," said he, "and not
only does me but my mother an injury. I
have no reason to say what is not true
now. I have only v few hours left on
this earth, and I wish to say that the
story that I abused my mother after she
climbed five pairs of stairs to see mn ia
not so. To-night is the first time I have
seen any reporters since I cave been in
the condemned cell. I killed Deady, but
I did it in sell-defense. 1 did not have a
fair trial, nor have I been treated right
since I have been here. Until Durrant
came the food was not tit for a pig, but it
is better now. All I ask is a square
deal. Do not go away and say that you
found me trembling in my pants.
"Since I have been in the condemned
cell I have slept every nieht, and any
stories to the contrary are lies. Do I ex
pect to go to the gallows like a man ?
Welly I do. I don't look as if I was afraid,
do I?"
Ana he did not, as he sat at a table
writing the last letter that will ever come
from bis pen.
The death watch is with him constantly,
and says that the man baÂ« not exhibited
the first sign ot lear and sleeps well. The

v â
Events Presented Yester
day Were All of a Mili
tary Character.
The Section Contest and the
Drivers' Race Were Most
Exciting and Interesting.
In the Broadsword Melee Two of the
Troopers Had Their Heads Cut
Baseball to B. Played To-Day.
f
The great military tournament, the first
of the kind ever held on the Pacific Coast,
has come to an end, and there are thou
sands besides those who actually partici
pated in it who will remember it with
pleasure.
The men who engaged in the several
events, sixty-three in number, did so in all
earnestness, and there was not a man who
came to the scratch who did not think if
he did not come in ahead he would at
least be second on the list. In their work
they were encouraged to the utmost by
the officers of the department, who were
detailed in various capacities to carry on
the many Â«jvents. Of the many officers
who were on the field director-general of
the games, Captain Alexander Rodgers,
Fourth Cavalry, is deserving of special
mention for the executive ability he dis
. played; also First Lieutenant Leon S.
Koudiez, quartermaster First Infantry,
who as secretary and treasurer of the de
partment games committee was in greater
demand on all sides than any other officer
at the post. To his excellent judgment j
is due much of the success of the tourna
ment.
There was an increased attendance yes
terday and the day was almost perfect.
Tne lue-of-war, mounted, which was
the first event, was not without its at
tractive features. There were teams from
the light battery and the cavalry. The
teams consisted of one captain and five
competitors. The limiting line-< were ten
yards, each team in column facing the
direction or the pull with nurses standing
at a distance of three yards from croup to
head. None o: the competitors was per
mitted to catch hold of his saddle or
mane of bis horse. The first heat was
won by Light Battery F of the Presidio,
and the second by Troop ii of the Presi
dio. The time in each instance was live j
seconds, and it was a remarkable fact that
th" teams that won were those headed j
toward the stables.
The 680 yards go-as-you-please race in j
li^ht marching order had six entries, but j
only four came to the scratch. Puckett of
G company was suffering from the injury
to his left knee, and he was not in condi
tion, still he came in a good second.
Chalmers of Company ri, of San Diego,
won in 2:54 2-5, Dougherty of Company B,
Benicia, third.
For bign jumping mounted, with 25 yards
â  start, inert- were five entries, but only two
starters, Robertson, Troop B, Presidio,
and Serueant Hart of 'iroop I, who,
tnoueh but a few days out of the hospital,
volunteered to enter just to niaice a con
test. Robertson had a splendid horse, that
jumped over t..e bar in tine style, and he |
made a record of 5 feet 2. inches. Hart
was satisfied witn 3 feet 6 inches.
Another novelty was the retiring sharp
shooter race. Tue contestants started at
scratch, with cartridge belt and five rounds
of ammunition, ran to their pieces, fifty
yards distant, with bolts taken out and
apart. On reaching that point the men I
pat down, assembled bo'ts, inserted them I
in the pieces and tired to scratch, halt
ing every ten yards and firing one shot to
the front in prone position, the last shot I
being fired at scratch. Puckett won this
in 56 1-5, Lung of Company D, B;nicia,
second.
There was another obstacle race be
tween a team of men from A Company of
the Presidio and one from D Company of
Benicia. This was the same as "the
obstacle race run the previous day,
but wa- more exciting. The winner was
the team of Company A, in 20 seconds.
Hennx and Eng3trom, who ran this race
the previous day, ran again. Hennz was |
the winner in 26 1-5.
The section contest between a team
from Light Battery C and one from Light
Battery F, both of the Presidio, attracted
close attention. Each section consisted of
a chief, caisson corporal, gunner, four
driver- and seven cannoneers. There
were four-horse teams. The-e were on
the ground lino 100 leet from the firing
line, thÂ« harness was oil the poles of the
pieces packed ten yards in the rear of the
gonna line. At a signal the men har
nessed and hitched their horses, advanced
and came into action "in buttery" on the
firing line and' fired one shot. Then the men
Changed a piece wheel with a spare wheel,
fired one shot to the rear, limbered up
and went to a picket line, made a counter
march and halted with beads of each
team of pieces at the picket line. The
first team reaching that line was the
winner, it it Had complied with all the
conditions. Phis was full of action and
was one of the most exciting of the entire
tournament. The men were on their met
tle in the matter of hitching up and mak
ing a change of wheels. Battery F lost
the contest because of some trouble with
the traces of the caisson team. Battery C
won in 5:40, Battery F scoring in G:CB.
The winners wÂ«Â»ro enthusiastically cheered
by soldiers and civilian*.
Then followed the semi-final of the
mounted tug-ot-war, which was won by
Battery B's team in 5 seconds.
Then there was wall-scaling over the
ten-foot wall, the same as at previous
contests minus the firing at an imaginary
enemy. The first heat was won by Com
pany D of Benicia in 19 1-5 seconds, and
the second by Company A in 19 2-5 sec
onds.
The next contest was one that required
a great deal of steadiness and nerve. The
This evening a bantam- championship battle between Jimmy Anthony of Australia and Jimmy Barry of America will bÂ« de-
cided in Woodward's Pavilion. The little 'uns are in prime condition and will assuredly give good accounts of themselves. The betting
favors Barry because of the stand tie nisde against Ward; whom Anthony failed to stop in ten rounds in this City a. few months ago ! But
Anthony has a first-class record, nevertheless, which he has reason to be proud of. He is slower than Barry, but of the two bantams An-
thony is the harder puncher and may bring down his game in short order this evening. The colored pugilists, Print and Armstrong arc

contestants, all cavalrymen, stood at
scratch dismounted, each holding an egg
in a table spoon; at a signal they mounted
and rode to llan No. 2 and deposited the
egg and spoon in a basket, a condition
being that the egg deposited shouid be
unbroken. Then each man dismounted,
took a cigar and twelve matches, mounted
and while mounted lit the cigar and rode
to flag No. 3. The conditions were that
these men should dismount and deposit
the clear lighted" in a basicet. Then each
man took a cio-eJ umbrella, opened it,
mounted, rode to flag No. 4, closed the
umbrella and deposited it in a dox. Then
each man took a glass, tilled it from a
bucket of water, mounted and returned
to flag No. 1, near the scratch. The con
dition was that the glass should be at
least hall fuil of water on reaching the
flag. Fernandez oi Troop K. performed
all the feats well, but lost considerable
time in lighting his cigar. Millner of
Troop B was doing very well, and it
seemed as if he would win, when sud
denly after raising his umbrella, his sad
dle turned and he was thrown to tlie
ground. He however picked hirmelf up
and continued on. Then Stable did some
good worK, but the sudd n stopping of
his horse cau-ed the epp to fall, and that
counted against him. The winner was
Fernandez in 3:41; the distance traveled
440 yards.
The drivers' contest, light artillery, was
another exciting event. There were" foutj
horse teams hitched to pieces. They were
driven between twelve posts set on the
corner of three small squares, the diago
nals of which were ten feet long. The
centers of the squares were located h:ty
yards apart on the same line, one diago
nal of each square coinciding with that
line. The contestants ,-tood with the
heads of the lead team one yard from the
southeasterly side of the cenier square,
facing in anorthwesteily direction. At
the signal the driver* staried, passed
through the center square in a north
westerly direction, wheeled to right and
passed through the northern square in a
northeasterly direction, making a circle to
the left, passing back through the north
ern square in a southeasterly direc
tion, wheeling to the right, passing
through the outer -quare in a southwest
erly direction, wheehn- to tne le:t,
and passing through the Southern square
in a souibeaster;y direction, maKing a. cir
cle to the right and passing back through
the southern square in a northwesterly
direction. The accomplishment of these
maneuvers n quired a great deal of skill
in the handling of the tt-arns. Posts that
were knocked down had to be set up im
mediately after the piece passed and five
seconds was added for each post knocked
down. The driver of team of Battery F
did very fine work, but turning too short
knocked down two posts in one square and
one in another. The other team was win
ning giory and p. audits and was about to
enter the last ?quare when the off-pole
horse slipped and lell and threw his rider.
Despite this accident the team was rushed
through. Battery 0 was the winner in
1 :33 3-5.
The fifty-eighth event was another res
cue-race for cavalry. This was a team of
two men from each company, who were
to rescue comrades whose horses bad been
killed. No. lof tach team stood mounted
at scratch, armed with a revolver in
holder with the flap buttoned and five
blank cartridges in his belt. No. 2
crouched behind his thrown hur*e, a hun
dred yards distant. He was with carbine
in hand with five blank cartridge* in the
magazine. At the signal No. 1 drew his
revolver, loaded it, then raced 10 No. 2,
emptying his revolver as he went along.
In the meantime No. 2 fired his five shots,
the conditions being that none should be
fired except when the horse was down.
After firing the fifth shot he abandoned
his horse, mounted behind No. 1 and rode
back to scratch, each man bringing his
arms with him. This was a pretty event
and well executed. The three horses
that were thrown remained down while
fired over, and after they were abandoned
their riders were rescued. Two of the
"dead" horses rose before their riders
were carried to scratcn, but the third re
mained down until his rider returned to
him. Many thought the animal 'really
dead, but they soon discovered that be
was only dead on to his business. Th*Â»
winners were the men of Troop K. in 33 2 5
seconds.
Then came a broadsword contest called
melee for '.earns from cavalry. The con
testants stood in two lines ten feet apart
equipped with broadswords and masks.
The men eac 1 wore a paper pompon on
the top of his mask and it was cut and
slash in their efforts to knock off the
pompons. During the melee Sergeant
l>xvis had his sword, an oak one, broken
off at the hilt and two men had their
scalps cut, but not seriously. The first
heat was won by the team from Troop X
and the second by the t-am from Troop C.
There was a mounted skirmish contest
for trooper?. There were two entries.
The men took track. <â . rew their sabers
and slashed right and left at stuffed heads
on the ground, in J returning tired with
revolvers at stuffed beads on posts, after
which they threw their horses and l:red
five shots while the horses were down.
Fernandez won in 1:50 4-5, and Jlerry of
Troop 1 recorded in 3:37- The tourna
ment closed with tbe tinais in the relay
race. Tbe winners were the team from
Battery X iv 2:0b", and that from Battery
Dio3:l2)Â£
To-day there will be a game of baseball
between a picked nine o: tne men at the
Pres'dio. and one picked from the men of
other posts. The grand-stand I, rices (rill
be reduced, and the proceeds devoied to
the curchase of uniforms for the winning
'.earn.
DEATH WAS NEAR HIM.
A Falling I'anÂ« of Glass Narrowly EB
capes Striking Â» City Mall Ele
vator Operator. *
One of the men who operates an elevator
at. the new City Hall had a narrow escape
from death yesterday and in a moat
peculiar manner. The workmen who are
iMi '.aired on toe roof were making some
alterations in the skylight just above
the elevator near the Larkin street win
when a uuge pane of glass a quarter
of an inch thick fell down the elevator
shaft.
The elevator man was standing in the
doorway of his case at the second floor j
when he beard a crash and a bit; piece of
Rlas:) came down through the narrow
space between the cage and the wall nar
rowly missing his head and dashing to
pieces on the floor of the well.
Had it struck him it would doubtless
have inflicted a fatal wound as the frag
ment weighed several pounds and had
sharp edges where it had been fractured
before reaching the cage.
THE HAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 23, 1897.
A NEW ORGAN FOR
TRINITY CHURCH
The Ladies Start a Fand
With a $4600 Sub^
scription.
Many Revisions Made in the
Specifications bj Organist
Stewart.
Its Construction Electro-Pm --umaiic
Throughout-The id;a That of
G nera ILuglilon
Trinity Episcopal Cnnrch is to have a
new organ, one whose appearance and
musical capacity will form only another
attraction to one of tte most beautiful sa
cred editices in San Francisco.
The idea was first suggested by General
James F. Houghton, ana occurre i to him
while on a recent tour of .be East. He
had a plan of the church loft prepared and
sent to him, and it was submit ed to one
of the leading organ manufacturing firms
of the country, located in Boston.
Specifications for three organs hare been
>ent on to the church, and one has been
selected as the organ for which a contract
is soon to be made. The specifications
were revised by Organist H. J. Btewart.
i^ast Wednesday the ladies of the
church held a meeting to consider the
proposition. It resulted in the sum of
|4600 which remained from the sale of
the old Trinity Home being subscribed to
the undertaking. A committee to take
the necessary steps to raise the remainder,
several thousand dollars, was appointed
by the pastor. Rev. Dr. G. E. Walk, in
the persons of General Houghion (chair
man), Mr;. Montgomery Godley, Mrs.
William H. Taylor, Major William B.
Hooper and Colonel Mudleton ot the
medical department of the United States
army.
The specifications, as revised by Organ
ist Stewart, provide that there sliail be
tliree manuals and a peaal of two octaves
and two notes. The compass of the organ
is to be from upper C to A, making a
range of -txty-one note*. The comuv
of tne pedal will be from upper F to D,
maKiug a range of thirty notes.
Tne keyDoard will be located in the
choir arch, end the organist will sit facing
the cone reunion. This idea belongs ex
clusively to Mr. Stewart. Both the choir
arc 1 anu tliat toward the chancel will be
tilled with appropriate casework, built
from any of the native bard woods, sup
porting groups of pipes tastefully ar
ranged and decorated in gold and colors
or treated id bronzes, as may be pre
ferred.
The great organ will contain 881 stops
and pine-, the swell organ 906, the clior
organ 427, the pedal organ 90. The organ
will have mechanical registers, end is to
ba built entirely upon electro-pneumatic
principle*, applied to keys, pedals and
stops throughout. The whole is to be
constructed according to the highest
standard of organ-building.
One peculiar innovation is that by elec
tric action entirely a chime of tuirteen
be.ls in the church tower will be operate!
entirely from the keyboard of tbe organ.
DENIS O'SULLIVAH SANG.
Tbe Sixth Concert of the San
Francisco Symphony So*
cety.
They Rendered * Mos: Excellent Pro
gramme to a Crowded House
V sterday.
The sixth and last concert of tbe San
Francisco Symphony (Society under the
old rule took place yesterday afternoon.
And, as Mr. platt said, in a short speech,
'â¢Yon can't have music without mon^y."
So, unless 600 of the subscriptions for the
new ser.es of concerts are signed, San
Francisco will once more be without a
symphony society.
The first number on yesterday's pro
cram me was Yon Weber's beautiful
overture to "Ob^ron." Always a lovely
number, the exquisite rendition given it
by the society made it doubly so. The
symphony by Ruoinstein, No. 5 in G
minor, was very well .lone indeed, the
second movement bei:i< particularly
bn-;h:. This symphony pras, by the way,
the last one ever written by that wonder
ful composer.
Number three, Denis O'Snllivan's solo,
wns, ot coarse. thÂ« number must looked
forward id. lit s-ng tirst an aria from
"Don Carlos," by Verdi, and in reply to
persistent applauÂ»u the prelude to "II
Pagliacci."
It is hoped that the Symphony Society
will continue to give these concerts, and
indeed there seems to be no reason why
they shouid not, for of late they have e;i
joye ' an immense popu arity with the
music-lovers of the City. Yesterday's con
cert was crowded, and it . as been so for
the past threa times. There was a gen
eral expression of regret at the possibility
of their discontinuance.

made up for lost time, and she went up

The Pacific Coast Steamship' Company's

HOME MISSIONS bUFFER.
T)iÂ«Â» New York Frcubyterlan Board Is
Short of Fun<!Â«â Local Work Matt
Be Curtailed.
The Presbyterian Chinese and Japanese
Mission work in this City, a* well as in
Portland, is likely to be considerably re
striced for lack of lunds.
Tne aews that the mission board in New
York had decided that retrenchment must
be made in ihe Pacific Coast work was an
nounced at tne monthly meeting of the
Woman's Occidental Board and was re
ceived with a good deal of regret. The
Nf w York board has decided to retrench
on home mission work rather than on for
e ign missions, as tiie foreign missionaries
are already In the field, far from their
country and friends, and the non-arrival
of their salaries would mean actual waut
and destitution to them.
The members of the Occidental Board
state that cutting down the expense ot
the home mission woik may entail some
discomfort on the workers, but no actual
want.
Five thousand dollars is the sum which
the New York board has decided must be
retrenched on coast work. The local mis
sions which will be hampered are the
Presbyterian Chinese Mission at 920 Sac
ramen.o street, Rev. Dr. Condit's work
in connection with the Chinese Presbyte
rian Church, on Stockton street, and Dr.
Sturgis' Japanese Mission on Haight
street.
Must rÂ»y the ' Damages.
The Supreme Court has ou.staiaed the jurip
ment of the Superior Court of San Francisco in

guardian, against the Pacific Can Company.
This company is engaged in making cans and
other articles. Nora Russell was one ot Its
employes, and she was severely injured by hot
water aud steam irom nn exhaust-pipe. In
the Superior Court she obtained damages for
$2500, the nward being made upon the
ground of neglect on the part of the company

CHARLEY FAIR
HAS DEPARTED
It Is Said That He Has
Taken a Journey to
Europe.
His ' Hal -Million Legacy From
His Father Has Fallen
Due.
Left on Wednesday Lastâ George A
Knight Says He Will Be Back
'â â \ in a Few Days.
Charley Fair has folded his tent and,
like the Arab, has stolen silently away.
There wan no blare of trumpets when he
depr.rted, and in fact it appears as though
he did no: care to have his destination be
comt? publicly known.
Day before yesterday Charley Fair l>e
tnrr.e 30 years of age, and enlitied to the
$500,000 left by his father to become his
when he attained that age, and this seems
to have given him the opportunity he de
sired, for on the 4 o'clock boat of that day
he went across the bay, and is supposed
to be now speeding his way eastward,
possibly to Europe.
Just what bearing his departure and ab
sence will have on the case now before the
courts is a problem, but those in a posi
tion to know say that it will have none at
all, and that the great struggle over his
father's millions can go on just as well
without his presence.
George A. Knight of Knight <fe Heggerty,
nis attorneys, said last night that Mr.
Fair had not lelt ;he City, but mipht in a
few days. He stated that the $500,000
legacy had not been as yet turned over to
the young man.
Mr. Heggerty, his partner, said that
Fair bad gone out of the City for a few
days, but might return during the trial.
Both were certain that his presence or
absence would have no material bearing
on the Fair case.
1 At the California Hotel it was stated
that Mr. Fair had left the City on
Wednesday, but the management pro
fessed not to know where he had sjone or
when he would return.
An intimate friend, who talked with
him recently, imparted me information
that the young millionaire had gone to
Europe for an indefinite period.
"Charley told me some time ago," he
B.iid. "that he was preparing for a trip
abroad, and that he might be gone a lons
time.
"His old troubles have come back on
him to some extent, and t.e strain of tfce
letral troubles that have been gathering
have been too much for him. His legacy
of $500,000, due when he became 30 years
of ajre, worried him somewhat, but when
liesaw that it was within his grasp he
prepared for the journey.
"1 do not know whether or not he
actually received the money, but he was
evidently satisfied that it was safe. It
may be that he did not care to be in the
City or State wldle the Fair case was on
trial, but he made no mention of such a
matter to me."
"THE MALEDICTION."
Entertainment to lie Given by the
Gentlemen's Sodality.
On the evening of the 28th insr. tl c
grand sacred drama entitled "The Male
diction" will be presented by the best
amateurs in San Francisco at St. Igna

A feature of the occasion will be the
debut of a professional male quartet,
which will sing mÂ»!odies composed for the
occasion by a local composer. Neilly
O'Sullivan will also appear. Tne seating
capacity of the college hall is 2500, and
still the demand for seats is so brisk that
it is thought it will be necessary lo giva

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
All that we can say for little Greece is
that we glory in her pluck.
Mrs. Grundv will be shocked at the suc
cess of the Turks. They wear bloomers.
Unless more dough is put up for the
Balboa-avenue fund we won't hava the
enjoyment of the cake.
It is now clear thut the Turk is not
reedy to leave Europe, and there is no
body to hurry him. Europe will have to
wait.
It looks as if Colonel Yassos will have
to take a second -thought and decide to
leave Crete for a while and attend to busi
ness at home.
Lts Angeles will be surprised to learn
next week tftat a war has been going on.
They believe down there that the whole
world is dancing.
The Mississippi floods will probably
cost us as mucn as the war will cost
Greece and Turkey, and we won't get any
glory out of it either.
The British fleet n.-\s moved to Malta
ami the Russian fleet seeks permission to
] ass tne Dardanelles. The big does are
evidently intent 0:1 getting close to the
bone.
The attempt of young Mason of Illinois
to teach his Senatorial grandmother how
to suck eggs is the latest piece of Chicago
impudence, but it was regarded as amus
ing rather than irritatin?.
If John L. Sullivan had any doubts of
his present place among the hst fighters
of tlie world he ought to have them fret
tied now. Old Jem Mace has challenged
him and is ready to put up money on the
outcome.
Tiie war veterans who were defrauded
cut of their positions in Government of
fices by tne Cleveland administration are
being restored by "Comrade" McKinley,
and some of the mugwumps and cuckoos
are sr.rieking that civil service is going to
be ruined.
Washington officials expect to be ready
to call for bids for grading and excavat
ing at the postoffice site within three
weeks, so it appears the agitation for the
beginning of work on the building has
been much more successful than some
people expected.
Senator Hoar"s reference to the House
as a body "which adjourns every three
days in order to get time to attack the
Senate for not attending to business"
shows that the old gentleman has a very
neat humor of his own when he happens
to be out of humor.
The Cubans have scored another vic
tory and have now established their au
thority over all parts of the island. Spain
seems to be continuing the war through
sheer obstinacy and holds on to Havana
simply because she hasn't sense enough
to know when to turn loose.
The Democratic minority in the House
of Representatives seems to be large
enough to split, and there is a good pros
pect that it will be done in the near
future. Boy Bailey doesn't seem to have
strength enough to hold the wild colts,
nor skill enough to guide them.
Ealinas has given a true and genuine
California welcome to the veterans of the
Grand Army and her people deserve the
thanks of the State for doing it. Every
patriot is gratified when a rightful honor
is worthily shown to the old soldiers who
freed the slaves and kept the Union
whole.
The announcement of an invention by
which 3000 words a minute can be trans
mitted over a single wire promise! some
thing like a revolution in telegraphy, and
what we will need next is something
which will enabie a man to read 3000
words a minute so that he can keep up
with the news.
The members of the Honse of Repre
sentatives are not to be altogether idle
during the remainder of the extra ses
sion. A committee of them is to engage
in an international ches3 contest with a
committee of the .British Parliament, and
next to attending to business this is per
haps tne best thing they can do, provided
they do it well enough to wax the
Britishers.
The promoters of the Valley Forge Park
have induced Pennsylvania to buy most
of the land on which Washington en
camped and are now trying to get the re
mainder purchased and added to the park.
The intention is to have each of the orig
inal thirteen States erect separate monu
ments to their troops who served during
the Revolution, and thus make the park a
National memorial hardly inferior to the
great field at Gettysburg.
The reception given to Embassador Hay
on his arrival in England has been cor
dial to the extent of effusiveness. The
Mayor of Southampton welcomed him by
quoting one of Hay's own poems, "Once
More Hail England," and every effort was
made to convince him that he is at home
and among his friends. The meaning of
all this is that the British have a clear
understanding of the importance of culti
vating the friendship of the United States,
and if they can induce our Embassador
to take a poetical view of the relations of
*** two countries tney will do iv
RECIPROCITY WITH FRANCE.
In an address at a banquet in New York given to him on his appointment as Em
baÃsador to France General Horace Porter stated that one of the chief objects of his
concern in bis new office would be that of arranging for reciprocal trade relations be
tween France and America for the mutual benefit of both countries, and for the pur
pose of confirming the friendly relations between the United States and the great
republic of Europe.
The speech was an excellent one and the ambition expressed was worthy of the
Embassador of one great country to another. Nevertheless, like all other good inten
tions those expressed by General Porter may go astray and lead to injury unless they
are weil directed. A reciprocity treaty with France will have to be very carefully con
sidered, or else some of the important industries of this country may be exposed to a
ruinous competition with the cheaper labor of the French.
California has a particular interest in this subject, inasmuch as the section of
the Dingley bill which provides for reciprocity treaties with foreign countries author
izes the President to concede to countries with which such treaties are made freedom
of trade or very low rates of duty with respect to a number of specified articles, among
which are brandies, champagne and all other sparkling wines, still wines, mineral
waters, sugar and molasses.
These articles are of California production, and are also produced in large quan
tities in France. It will b9 seen that if reciprocity with that country should ba
arranged on terms which would permit the free entry of French wines, mineral
waters and sugar to the United States some of the most important industries of
California would be materially injured.
The aim and intent of reciprocity treaties is to provide for trade with foreign
countries in such a way as to promote American commerce without surrendering the
home market to an extent that would injure home industry. T<> effact this it will be
necessary that our Erabassadors abroad and the State Department at home should be
very careful of those industries which, while lo.'al in their nature, are nevertheless
important to the National welfare.
It would be well if we could have wines, sugars and mineral waters taken ont of
the list of articles which are 10 be made subjects of reciprocity treaties. Still no harm
will come from leaving them there provided due care is taken not to make concessions
on these articles to countries which produce them to any lar^e extent. We can all
sympathize with General Porter's desire to distinguish his f-ervice in France by
arranging a commercial treaty, but nevertheless we must be careful that he does not
endanger the interests of any section of the Union in doing so.
WILLIAM S. HOLMAN.
By the death 0! William Steele Holraan
tha country loses another of those states
men whose public services began before
the outbreak of our Civil War. It is a
fast-vanishing generation. There remain
in Congress but three men â Senator Mor
rill, Senator Harris and the venerable
Galusba Grow in the Home-wtio took
part in the struggles of politics at the
time when Holman began his career.
Secretary Sherman adds a fourth to the
list of such veterans now in office, and
these are all that survive in official life of
tlie men who directed our politic j in the
days when slavery was the dominant
issue before the conn try and economic
topics were regarded as matters of minor
moment.
Holman entered public life as soon as
ha attained manhood, having been elected
Probate Judge when but 21 years old.
After having served his State in various
capacities he was elected to Congres-s as a
Democrat In 1856. Since that time he has
been renominnted by the Democrats of
his district for each succeeding Congress.
Four times he was defeated, but after
each defeat was re-elected, and now closes
his lifa by dying in office.
The position in Congressional life held
by Mr. Holman was one in wi icn he had
no rival. He made it his duty to care
fuliy investigate every bill presented, and
paid particular attention to appropriation
bills. He watched every move made on J
the floor 01 the House, and whenever he
thought wrone was boingdone or undue
haste exercised he would promptly inter
pose the objection that would prevent j
the passage of the bill by unanimous con- ,
sent. It was from this haoit, not always
well cr discreetly exercised, he gained
his we.l-known title of "the great ob
jector," and also the repute of being the
"watchdoe of the treasury."
While Holman was not in any sense a
great statesman, nor even an inspiring
party leader, his firm and long-continued
hold upon the esteem of his constituents
proves him to have been no ordinary man.
No one not possessed of sterling qualities
of a high order could have held his posi
tion so long in such a political storm
center as Indiana, nor could a person of
common merit have so repeatedly recov
ered from defeat and achieved victories
after disaster. We have, therefore, lost
from our politics a strong as well as an
honest and notable man, and it will proD
ably be long before Indiana can fill his
place in Congress with an equally capabie
successor. ______________
EEPOETING PEOGEESS.
Our special correspondent at Washing
ton reported yesterday another step made
in progress toward the beginning of work
on the new Federal building la this City.
He announces that C. L. Spaldine, Assist
ant Secretary of the Treasury, has assured
Mr. Loud that he would immediately take
steps to prepare the specifications upon
which bids for the building are to be based,
and that bids would be advertised for as
soon as possible. He added that in hit
opinion within three weeks advertise
ments would be published for bids for the
work of grading and excavating.
It will be seen that progress toward the
attainment of the much-desired work on
the building is going steadily ahead and
that already much has been accomplished.
Mr. Loud, taking advantage of the fact
that the House of Representatives is not
actively engaged in public business, is de
voting a considerable portion of his time
pressing the work, and has been suffi
ciently successful to obtain a prompt, con
sideration of the subject on the part of the
treasury officials. He can be relied upon
to continue urging the subject at Wash
ington, and the outlook is therefore dis
tinctly encouraging.
The agitation started in tbis City by
The Call and so cordially and vigorously
supported by our various commercial and
industrial bodies has begun to bear good
fruit. The success attained shou'd ba re
garded, however, as an argument for con
tinued work here, and not as a reason for
abandoning it. "There is many a slip
'twixt the cup and the lip" in politics as
well as in other affairs of life, and it wilf
not do for us at this time, under a false
sense of security, to relax either our vigil
ance or our energies.
Congressman Loud should be cordially
supported from this City, and other mem
bers of thÂ« California delegation in Con
gress should be urged to unite their efforts
with his in hastening the work. The con
struction of the Federal building should
be begun early this summer, and we mnst
not show any weakening in our demand
to that effect.
Reports from nearly naif tue counties
In Illinois, including almost all where
winter wheat it grown, are to the effect
that two-thirds of the wheat sown last
fall was winter killed or ruined by the
spring floods and the remaining third will
hardly yield wheat enough for seed, so that
the State will have to buy wheat for food.
It will be seen that everything consDires
to give the ball in the wheat market a
picnic this year.
General Porter's ambition to distinguish
his services as Embassador to France by
â arranging a reciprocity treaty with that
country is a good one, provided it is well
curbed and' not permitted to rim over the
YiaeyÂ»rdÂ» of California.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 23, 1897.
PATEIOTIG SALINAS.
It has fallen this year to Salinas to thow
to the veterans of the Grand Army in
their annual encampment the continued
interest which the people take in all that
concerns that organization, and the loyal
love with which the younger generation
regard the veterans to whom we owe the
preservation of tlie Union and the pres
ent grandeur and prosperity of the Re
public. This duty the j eople of Salinas,
according to all reports, have well per
formed. They have made their city ra
diant with banners, and their homes have
been opened with cordial hospitality to
the veterans and to all their friends.
It is altogether right and fitting that
the annual gathering of the veterans of
the Grand Army should be made an occa
sion tor a public festival in tlie commu
nity where the encampment is held.
Such displays have an effect in the pat
riotic education of the young, and serve,
moreover, 10 afford opportunities to the
general public for giving renewed evidence
of tlieir appreciation of the services of the
soldiers of the Union. Tcese testimonials
of esteem cannot be rendered too often,
and it is always gratifying when they can
be shown not only to the memory of the
Grand Army as a mass, but to the individ
uals who compose it, eo that each of the old
veterans may feel some personal share in
the honor so loyally given.
Wherever in California these encamp
ments have been held, they have been
worthily prepared for and celebrated by
the people. Salinas is now showing
chrough her hospitality and through h*r
festal arrangements the sentiment which
all the (,'alif jrnians feel. She is giving
evidence that the old soldiers are more
than welcome in every part of California.
Their coming is hailed, not merely as that
of friendly visitors, but as an honor of
which a community may be justly proud.
In its way the Salinas celebration is not
less deserving of praise and credit than
that brilliant fiesta which now illumines
Los Aneeles, and the peop'e who have pre
pared tfai? huspitnb'e and patriotic recep
tion for the oil veterans deserve to reap
from it nolittie reward.

THE PLANET MERCURY.
Since the recent discoveries as to the topography of Mercury, this elusive planet has not
been in such a favorable position for observation as it will occupy during the remainder of
this month. At dusk it may now be seen as a star of the first magnitude near the Pleiades in
the northwestern sky, and when at greatest Â£. elongation. 20 decrees 43 minutes from the sun
on April 28, it will be about a degree south of the group in a horizontal Hue. It sparkles with
a rather yellowish luster in contrast to the white light of Venus, which is considerably
larger, and was only half its distance when recently so conspicuous in the western heavens,
but Mercury shares general interest at present on account of the discovery at the Lowell
Observatory of strange markings on the surfaces of .both bodies.
Though nearer to the sun than any known planet, Mercury it not a good reflector of the
profuse effulgence it receives, and some of its tracts seem to be particularly aim, more so even
than the dark lunar plains. To Mr. Lowell and his 24-inch lens the scientific world is indebted
for a knowledge of the true form of these dark-tinted areas, and so.doubt, too. for the discovery
of many of them, as his map is more complete than any delineation of the surface betore
attempted.
These strange lines that streak the disk in various directions had long given impressions
to telescopic observers that there were markings some distance from the brighter limb of the
planet, but the intervening spaces were indistinguishable.
A rotation period of about twenty-four hours had been inferred, though never fully ac
cepted. In 1889 S.?hiaparelli announced that the rotation period corresponded with the time
ol revolution around the sun, or very nearly so, and this important discovery was soon con
firmed by others, and again recently by the distinct and accurate views obtained at the Lowell
Observatory. A similar correspondence between the axiai and orbital motions of Venus was
also announced and fully confirmed afterward, and more recently by Mr. Lowell and his staff.
As the same sides of these planets are thus always presented to the sun, their evening
phases present the same sections of surface to our view, with only such variations as come
MAP OF MERCURY, MADE BY PROFESSOR LOWELL.
from Increase and libration. Mercury, then, bolng now in crescent phase, Is revealing the
curious network of lines on the west side of the accompanying map from a drawius; by Mr.
Lowell.
The oval aspect is an allowable distortion by which is Included the extent of surface seen
by the libration, which, on account of its very eccentric orbit, is about five-eighths of the
whole. The angular outlines are so unlike the lunar tracts, the belts of Jupiter, or the con
tinents and canals of Mars, that there is much vague conjecture as to the real nature of the
little panel's topography. Analogy suggests rivers and mountains, but the vastness of the
scalp annuls all resemblance to such terrestrial features. Neither the Amazon nor the Andes
ooold be possibly discerned on the earth's surface at a distance of from seventy to one
i:unÂ«lred millions of miles.
The horizontal hor?eshoe, as Mr. Lowell calls the northern, eastern and southern border
markincs, was found to be singularly effective in demonstrating the extent of the llbration,
the curve being sometimes a considerable distance from the terminator. As his Mercunan
nomenclature, which is chiefly classic, will probably survive, a few terms maybe used for
The curve marked 29 in the map is named Argl Rejrio and is particularly conspicuous.
The broken boraer lines, 16 and 4. are named respectively Lyrae Regio and Mercatorum Regio,
while the continuous line, 18 and 5, Is formed of Testudinis Regio and Petasl Regio. The
latter line, land, water, or phantom, whichever It may be, is destined to endure, as in fifty
drawings made independently by several observers at the Lowell Observatory.it holds its
place without important deviation.
Even in some of the older maps It is easily seen that it formed a vague but real basis for
tho unreal tracts from which false lotation periods were derivea. That the axis of rotation is
perpendicular to the plane of revolution as announced by Schlaparelli is further confirmed
by the observations at Flagstaff. The atmosphere in which the planet has been enshrouded by
many observers seems to have vanished in the clear air of Arizona. When Mercury crossed the
sun's disk ia 1894, the moÃt propitious time for the detection of an atmospheric envelope, it
wf.s looked for in vain, and the constant distinctness of the dark streaks is also advanced'as
evidence against its existence.
That the pliinet is moonliite in other respect!, too. mountainous, rugged, crater-sprinkled
and arid is further supsestcd, but a mountainous surface has before been conjectured as a
cause for its dull reflecting power. The crater leatures are a new idea that has little founda
tion as yet. It is no longer possible, however, to class the extraordinary streaks a hundred
miles in width and many hundreds in length as mare imaginary objects as they have been seen
distinctly on several occasions by Mr. Lowell and his experienced staff. Not, do they exist?
but what are they? is the question to be solved by the telescopes ol the future.

FRATERNAL DEPARTMENT.
California Council of the National
Union Receives a VUit From the
San Francisco Cabinet.
Last Wednesday night Stanford Hall, in the
Alzacar building, was crowded to its limits by
members of California Council No. 530 and
visitors assemble'! !rnm other councils, who
were there to witness initiations in tbe most
amplified form and to be present when the
members of the San Fraucisco Cabinet should
enter, it having been announced that it would
during the evening "drop in, fraternally."
President Hastings and the officers were in
their respective Btntions on time, and when
the routine work had been disposed of the ex
pected visitors entered in a body and were
most cordially welcomed. During the even
ing there were four initiations, which were
the most complete that have ever been given
by a council, Â»nd so thoroughly was the worn
appreciated that a visitor, member of another
council nnd well versed in fraternal matters,
said: "It is a pity that more members of
other councils do not come to California Coun
cil. If thoy did they would learn something
of the work which would be of great service
lo them."
Under the head of good of the order there
were short instructive addresses by President
Fields of the cabinet; C. F. Smurr, general
freight agent of the Southern Pacific; Dr. A.
H. Millberry, vice-president of the cabinet;
Jud^eGeorKe H. liahrs, Edward Dillon Jr.,
Deputy J. N. Bunting, W. A. & Nicholson, L.
Vincent and others. Between speeches there
were songs by C. L. Gage, C. H. Van Onion and
W. E. l.utz. Max Selinman gave the members
an opportunity to discover the kind of a
whistler he is and Mr. Carter entertained with
specialties. The council's William Goat was
trotted out and after Rome violent exercise
showed signs of weakening. The council's
physician declared that it was suffering from
buck fever, and on his adrice it was sent to
the hospital.
Â£1 Dorado Council met last Friday night
with ex-President T. F. Butler In the chair.
Judge George H. Bahrs was elected a delegate
to the cabinet. During the evening the coun
cil was addressed Dy President Frank U. Hast

pects to return to California in time to attend
the session of the Grand Parlor.
Fremont Parlor gave a very pleasant "at
home" last Monday in the residence of Mrs.
Barton, on Clay street. There were a number
of visitors present, Including Grand Vice
president Mrs. Belle W. Conrad and Grand
Secretary Mrs. Georgia C. Ryan.
Grand President Mrs. Mary E. Tillman will
visit El Pesesdero Parlor at'Tmcy to-morrow
and will visit Forest Parlor at Plymouth

The membership of the order is proud of
the fact that the coming grand president,
Mrs. Belle W. Conrad of Sonora, has been
elected to the highest office in the Grand
Lodge of the Knights and Ladies of Honor, and
of the further fact that she is the first lady in
California who has been elected to that high
office, namely, the office of grand protector
Her election to that office is a recognition of

This Mysterious and Terrible DlieiM
Carefully Analyzed and Described.
What to Do When It Cornel.
Nearly every pbysician, every scientist
and every sufferer has been asking thia
great question: What is the Grip? What-
ever it may be it is certain that it is somt-
thinÃ within the body wnich is righting
with the body to undermine the life.
What would common-sense dictate in
snch an emergency? Counteract the en-
emy. Drive it from the system. Do not
trifle with it. Act promptly and wisely at
the first approach, which you can readily
detect. Take something which can coun-
teract their deadly influence. Spirits of
some kind are the best thing to take, and
whisky is preferable to any other kind of
spirit; but it should be borne very care-
fully in mind that only pure whisky will
have the effect, and It should also be re-
membered that Duffy's pure malt whisky
stands at the head of ail preparations, and
is the only medicinal whisky upon the
market. Scientists have asserted thi?, the
doctors have verified it and millions of
people have proved it beyou<i a aoubt.
There are many unscrupulous dealers who
will assure you that any whisky will
answer the purpose, but they are wrong
and are trying to deceive you. In case of
Grip yon cannot afford to take any chances,
therefore take thai which i*. beyond ques-
tion, pure, medicinal and the only valu-
able whisky upon he market.

CHARGE OF LIBEL
MAY BE DISMISSED
Samuel M. Shortridge De
fends Editor Frederick
Marriott.
Defective P.eadings and Slender
Shew ot Proof in the
Case.
Decisions of High Courts Indicate
That Candidates for O.fice May
Be Freely Criticiz?d.
Judge DainÃerfield listened to argument
yesterday by S. If. Shortridge in the case
of Editor Fred Marriott of the News Let
ter, accused of publishing a libel on Judge
Hebbard during tee last political cam
paign.
Last Wednesday the attorneys for the
prosecution introduced only one witness
to prove the charge egainst ilr. Marriott.
The only witness offered was W. 8.
Dreypolcher, who swore that he read tiie
article complained of; that he supposed
Mr. Marriott was the owner of the News
Letter, btcause two years ago he spoke ol
it as "ruy paper"; that Judge Hebbard
was at that time a candidate lor le-elec
tion, and that all this occurred in the City
and County of San Francisco.
On this showing Attorney Julius Kahn
I rested the case for the prosecution, the
| District Attorney and half a dozen depu
| ties acquiescing, not choosing to call any
other witnesses to show that any damage
had been done to Judge Hebbard or that
any libel had in fact been published.
In presenting his motion for a dismissal
of the charge against his client, Mr.
ridge said that he would rely on the as
sumption that if the law exists as he be
lieves it to cxi st, the court would iiud it
to be not only its sa( red duty, but a sacred
privilege of tne defendant to stop the trial
at t':is point and instruct the jury that no
case had been made out by the prosecution.
In that event the accused must go
hence freed from any imputation of
wrongdoing. The motion to dismiss
would be based on these points:
Firsr â The evidence does not prove that the
deiendant was the author ot the article com
plained of, or the editor or proprietor of the
News, Letter on October 31, IH9O.
Second â The evidence ijoes not prove the
publication of the alleged libel on October 31,
lS'.tU.
1 uirdâ The evidence does not prove a public
offense, a misdemeanor, to wit, ;ibel, has been
committed ty the defendant.
Fourthâ Tne evidence uo.s not prove that
the d>-fendiiit published the alleged libel on
the 31si oi October, IS9(>, or at any otner time.
Filthâ -Ths evidence does not prove that the
deiendant has published anything which has
exposed J. C. B. Hebbard to nd.cule, contempt
and hatred. The Criminal Code requires tne
use of the word "or" instead of '-aiid." Mis
use of tuifc word has universally been held to
vitiate a charge of this kind.
s nil â The evidence uoes not show that the
delendant published uny thing that impeached
tne honor, virtue and 'reputation of J. c. B.
Hebbard. the conjunctive being again used
instead of the disjunctive, as required by the
plain letter of ihe l.iiv.
Seventh â The evidence shows that the lan
guage alleged to be a criminal libel is am
biguous â so ambiguous mat it is susrepiible
ot diffeieiit constructions, some of such con
structions being of a meamtig so innocent
that they would not injure the reputation of
any person
Eighthâ That the evidence does not over
come the presumption of iuuoceuce wnich the
law throws around the Ueicntiant.
Muta â The evidence does not show or prove
that J. C. B. Hebbard has been injured eitber
in his private capacity as a citizen or in his
officia. capacity us a magistrate.
Tenth â The evidence does not show or prove
that the article complained oi is a libel.
Tne attention of the court was, oy Mr.
Shortridge, drawn to the fact that no
proof of ownership had been adduced ; that
there was nothing to show that Judge
Hebbard had been injured ; that where an
article is ambiguous, susceptible of two
interpretations, then the inuocent inter
pretation must be accepted, because the
.aw raises up a presumption of innocence.
All these and other technical points were
ur<ed, but Mr. Suortridtce bestowed on
those matters but a brief notice, passing
on to a full consideraiion of the broad
questions of public toiicy, which he said
were presented in this attack on the free
dom of the press.
He rejoiced tbat he was in a conrt of
law and justice, where subjects are to be
weighed careiully and where the idle
gossip of political campaigns is not to be
accepted as proof of crime. He submitted
that all the paid proof offered by the
prosecution in the attempt to fasten on Mr.
Marriott the cliarge of libel was utterly
insufficient. He argued that the proof of
ownership of the News Letter would not
have eÂ«tablished the title to a load of
hay. It has been universally held that
proof to sustain a criminal charge must be
much Clearer than would be required in a
civil actiou.
Touching the question of public policy
in sustaining the Jrtedom of the press,
Mr. bhortriu?e read from many authori
ties to show that when a man becomes a
candidate for office he challenges the
criticism of the entre community, and
that be mvÂ« t endure whatever is said in
good faith by his fellow-citizens; that in
fact any expression of opinion in this re
gard, written or spoken, is a privileged
communication.
One of the cases referred to is entitled
Bripgs vs. Garrelt, and is reported in No.
11l Pennsylvania State Reports, page 404.
whica shows circumstances somewhat
similar to those in the present case. The
syllabus contains the following:
If a respectable citizen honestly believes and
states that n candidate for a public office is
guilty of official misconduct or is a person of
ill repute in the sense that it affects his fitness
ior the office which be seeks, such a statement
is privilege i and may be repeated by another
in a meeiing assembled to inquire into tne
merits of the candidates, though it is abso
lutely false and upon inquiiy its falsity
inighc have been ascertained, without bein
liable in an action for libel; for the voter has
the right to canvass and discuss the qualifica
tions of the candidates who seek his suffrage
openly and lrcelv.
The syllabus further set fortn tbat w her.
a communication is made in good faith
the law does not imply malice, and that
actual malice must be proved.
In the case referred to Judge Brlpgs was
a candidate for re-election to the bench,
and Air. Garrett read a letter saying that
"the Hart Creek sewer steal of $200,000
was only made possible by Judge Bribes'
cuarge to the jury." In deciding the
matter at issue the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania said :
When Judge Briggs accepted the nomination
as a candidate for re-election to the judicial
position which he then filled, he threw out a
chaJenge to the entire body of voters of the
county of Philadelphia to canvass hi* qualifi
cations nnd fltneps for that position. Tbat in
volved in the "fierce light tnat beau upon the
throne," not only his oOlcinl conduct for the
term just closing:, but generally his fitness for
the posnion of Judge. In this may be Included
mauy things beyond mere legal knowledge. A
man may be a learned lawyer and yet be
wholly unfit for judicial fetation. There may
be faults of temper, mental idiosyncrasies and
such manner of walk and conversation in
private life as a people jealous of inn reputa
tion of their judiciary would never tolerate.
In conclnsion the same court made this
declaration :
ln the enforcement ot all general rules there
will always be cases of individual hardship.
But this Is the sacrifice which the individual
must make lor the public good.
Mr. Sbortridge Bald he admitted that in
the present case some hardship might fall
on Judjte Hebbard in being deprived or
bit revenge, but that was no reason why
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 23, 1897.
the rules of law and public policy should I
be reversed.
Among many authorities quoted he
cited the case of the Express Printing
Company vs. John H. <~opcland, in which
the Supreme Court of Texas said :
When a person becomes a candidate for a
public office, conferred by a popular election,
tie stiou.u be considered Â»s putting his coar
acter in issue, so lar us respects his qualifica
'lons for the office. Whatever pertaiua to the
qualifications ot the candidate for the office
sought is a legitimate subject for discussion
and' comment, provided ail statements are
confined to the truth or what in good faith
mm upon probable cause is believed to be true.
The press is entitled to the same privileges
and subject to the same limitations in dis>
cussing tne qualifications oi candidates as are
private individuals. â¢ â¢ * In our lorm of
government the supreme power is In the peo
ple; they create offices and select the officers.
Then, in the exercise of the high aud impor
tant power oi selecting their agents to admin
ister for them the nffairs of government, are
the people to be denied the right of discussion
and comment respecting the qualifications of
those who, by contenting to become candi
dates, challenge the Kupport of the people on
the ground ot their peculiar iitne&s for the
office sought?
Dozens of decisions of like import, in
cluding opinions of the California Su
preme Court, were cited and some of them
read to establish the soundness of his
position that the charga of libel had no
legal standing in court and ought to be
dismissed.
Mr. Sbortridge throughout defended the
constitutional right of the citizen freely
to express his sentiments concerning can
didates for public office. To deny or de
stroy this right would destroy free govern
ment. Majorities are not always right;
minoritiesâ the singls citizen, however
poor â may be right. Power does not make
right. In a free country there must be
liberty of speech and of the press, ana
men must Dot be denied the liberty of
espousing or opposing candidates lor pub
lic office; otherwise s;lf-governmeut is at
an end.
Mr. Kahn said he would make his reply
in a few words. He did not think the sub
ject under discussion had been touched by
Mr. Shortridge's citations and would not
consider them. He regarded the article
published by Mr. Marriott to be libelous
per Be, and on that point be relied for a
ruling in favor of the prosecution.
Mr. Shortndue responded by saying that
Mr. Kahn was fortunate in being able to
grasp and digest the deep meaning of the
fundamental principles treated of by the
learned Judges, whose words he hod read
and who had devoted months to the study
of questions that Mr. Kahn dismissed
witnout an instant's consideration. In a
few sentences Mr. Shortridge summed up
the reasons for asking for a dismissal of
the charge, and announced that he was
willing to take the ruling of the court.
Judge Daingerrield manifested an un
willingness to decide the matter oft
hand, preferring to take several days to
consider the questions presanted in Mr.
Shortridge's argument. He therefore
ordered the casts to be coutinued until
next Monday mornine, at 10 o'clock,
when he expects to render a decision on
the motion to dismiss the charge.
W. MORROW'S LECTURE.
A Learned Disquisition on
Federal, State and Munici
pal Government.
Y. M. C. A Auditorium Crowded With
Eiger Listenersâ Ster?opticon
ViÂ£W3 by J W. Erwin-
A learned and instructive lecture on the
"Federal Government" was delivered to a
large and appreciative aadience at the
Y. M. C. A. Auditorium, corner of Mason
and Ellis streets, la-t evening, by the Hon.
\Y. W. Morrow, Judge, of tne United
States District Court. The lecture was de
livered under the auspices of the young
men's improvement committee.
Attorney J. A. Percy actea as chairman
and introduced the speaker with a few
fehcitcus remarks on the objects aimed at
by the association, and Judge Morrow's
kindness in sparing time from his busy
life for the benefit of the youth of the City.
Prior to the lecture the speatter was es
corted from the parlors of the uuilding to
the hall by the committee, forty strong.
The lecturer b gaii with a discourse on
the Federal Government and a comparison
with otner republics. He exemplified tne
early republics of Greece and Home end
spoke of the fact that Greece, one of the
smallest of the republican forms of gov
ernment in ancient days, is at this time
the ouly power having courage enough to
fight for the downtrodden Cretans.
From the Federal the Judge went to
State and finally to municipal forms of
government, and explained the relation
to each other and to the whole. He pointed
out that it was one of the most prodigious
facts in existence that so many people are
linked together in to vast a territory to
form the greatest and niosi harmonious
government on earth.
At the conclusion of the lecture proper
some beautiful stereopticon views of the
Capitol at Washington, statuary of cele
brated statesmen and Government
building?, as well as foreign legation.-,
were projected upon a screen by J. W. Er
win of the Postofnce Department and
each explained in detail by the lecturer.
In conclusion the audience sang "Amer
ica," music being furnished particularly
oy the Herman Brandt amateur orchestra.

The Richmond district people arc op
posed to the petition of the Point Lobos
Improvement Club, now before the Super
visors, that the Sutro Railroad Company

the statement made that tbe rate of
speed was responsible for the recent acci
dent was false and an injustice to the
company. He said that a number of wit
nesses would testify that there was an ob
struction on the track.
Tbe Point Lobos Club was not repre
sented to press its petition, but several
Richmond residents appeared and stated
that tbe speed of the curs was not too
great. The petition was placed on file.

MARY LORING'S
SUSPICIOUS DEATH
Her Husband Charged With
Brutally Treating
Her.
He Was Arrested and Is Being
Held Pending an Inves
tigation.
In Her Statement She Says That He
Jumped on Her and Choked
Hr.
Robert boring, tinsmith in the employ
ment of George H. Tay it Co.. was ar
lested at his residence, 5 Gordon street,
last night by Detectives Gibson and Wren
and Officer McMurray of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
and is being detained in the "tanks" at the
City Prison pending further investigation
into the causes that lea to the death of
his wife.
Mrs. Mary Loring died at the Waldeck
Sanitarium about 2 o'clock Sunday morn
ing and her remains were interred in
Holy Cross Cemetery Wednesday after
noon.
Henry Burke, a brother of Mrs. Loring,
living at 944 Mission atrset. reported on
Wednesday morning to the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
that there were suspicious circumstances
in connection with his sister's death that
required investigation. He had heard
that her husband had jumped on her with
both feet, had choKed her and otherwise
ill- treated her, although the was in a
delicate condition.
Officer McMurray went to Lorinu's
bouse and there saw Mamie Burke, a sis
ter of the deceased, and he learned from
her that Mrs. Loring was dead and buried.
While he was talking to her Lorine came
downstairs and gruffly told McMurray
that there had been, too much talk about
his wife's death already and he didn't
want any more of it. He called the chil
dren and aske.i McMurray if they looked
as if they had b-en ill treated. He refused
to give McMurray any information or
allow Mamie Burke to say anything.
McMnrray succeeded in hndi.ijc Mrs.
Finnerty, another siser of the deceased,
who told him to see Miss Nathalie Selling,
a physician at 814 Sutter street, who at
tended Mrs. Loriug. McMurray saw Mis*
Selling, but she felt annoyed that any in
quiries should be made about Mrs. Lor
ing's death and remarked, "What is the
use? if the man is arrested his little
children will bs the sufferers. Mrs. Lor
ing died of peritonitis, and mat should be
enoueh."
McMurrav yesterday morning reportea
to Captain Bohen wnat he had been able
to ascertain, and Captain Bohen detailed
Gibson and Wren on the case with Mc
|f array.
They saw Mr?. Kipp, 511 Castro street,
who was in the room with Mrs. Loring
the day before her death. She told them
that sue stepued from the room for a few
minutes, and when she returned Miss
Sel ing at-ted her to sign a statement
made by Mr*. Loring to the effect that
her husband had jumped upon her ab
domen with his feet and choked her and
otherwise brutally abused her. Mixs Sell
lntt keDt the Mtteraent. Mrs. Kipp also
told them that Miss Selling had gone to
Mm. Loring's sisters and asked them to
keep quiet about their sister's death.
Atter thi* statement tne officers thought
it was their duty to place Loring under
arrest. Last night they went to his house
and found all the doors locked. Loring
opened an upper window and asked them
what they wanted. After a good deal of
persuasion he came downstairs and opened
ttie front door.
When they told him that he was wanted
at police headquarters he showed fight,
and after a desperate struggle he was
overpowered ana the handcuffs put on
him. He had a knife up the sleeve of bis
coat, but he had no cbance to use it.
At tbe City Prison Loring was in an
ugly mood and gruffly refused to say any
thing, saying it was nobody's business.
The aetectivet and McMunay went to
Miss Selling's office last night and ob
tained from her the statement made by
Mr*. Loring and signed by Mrs. Kipp.
The body of Mrs. Loring will also be dis
interred to-day and an autopsy made.
A PACIFIC ASSOCIATION.
The Olympic and Acme Clubs Are
First in the Field to Or- lv/%
ganize.
A committee from the Olympic Glob,
consisting of Howard Taylor, J. P. Kelly,
Percy Moras and Douglas White, was
appointed to confer with the directors of
the Acme Athletic Club, with the object
of forming a Pacific .CoaH Amateur Ath
letic Association. The Olympic Club re*
ceived a notification from J. P. Cook, the
secretary of the Acme Club, that bis club
has withdrawn from the Pacific Athletic
Association and that the officers will do
; all in their power to aid the Olympics in
organizing an association which will for
mulate its own laws and regulations. It
is thought that the Stanford and Berkeley
colleges will also join hands with the
Olympics.
On 'Saturday afternoon an inter-col
legiate field day will be held at the Olym
pic grounds, but the bicycle races will take
place at the Velodrome track. The points
which c tint are 5 for first, 2 for second
and 1 for third. Judging from the per
formances of the athletes on both sides of
the water, the contests should be close,
although it is whispered that the Stanford
athletes will win a majority of the track
events, and that (he field events will be
warmly contested. The University of
California faculty athletic committee de
cided the question of points which the
Berkeley atuietes objected to at first. -â

PRINTING PRESSMEN.
They Hold Governor Bndd Responsible
for Striking at Organized
Labor.
The following resolutions were adopted
by the San Francisco Printing Pressmen's
Union last Wednesday evening:
Whkreas, Sacramento Printing Pressmen's
Union No. CO denounced the action of Gov
ernor Bund in vetoing the appropriation lor
the support of the State Printing Office; and
whereas, San Francisco Printing Pressmen's
Union No. 24 is of the opinion and hereby em
phatically declares that the State Printing
Office is a necessary and useful institution, not
only to union mechanics, but to the taxpayers
of the State, and should be maintained and
fostered for the good that there is in it and
the goad it ' can do and is doing; and
whereas, the action of the Governor in veto
ing said appropriationâ thus taking a
stun that will throw several hundred union
mechanics out of employment â is not only
reprehensible, but vicious in the extreme, and !
is an uncalled-for blow at labor; and whereas,
this union knows that the State Printing
Office is the last, not the first state institution,
that should be sacrificed upon the altar of al
leged DJlitlcal "reform" for the one reason if
tor none other â laying the question of union
labor asideâ that it gives better returns for the
money invested than any other public insti
tution in this State; and whereas, the school
textbook system is the pride of all Cali
foruians not in the employ of interested par
ties, and the question of its ab: listiment, if
submitted to a vote of the people, would be
defeated by a vote so great that the adherents
of the schoolbook ring would appear as scat
tering In the returns. The closing of the State
Printing Office not only abolishes the system
of the State series of school textbooks, but
takes from the mechanics who make those
books the daily wages which they
honestly earn and embarrasses the |printing
trades throughout the State of California. The
State Printing Office is oue ol the bulwarks of
organized labor in this State. None but union
mechanics are employed therein and fair
wages are paid, thus tendlne to keep up wages
throughout the State and dignity the sphere
of labor. The fact that fair wages are paid in I
the State Printing Office is a most important
factor in the maintenance of a fair scale of
wage srlsewnere, ana the abolishment of the
State office means, almost certainly, a cut iv
wages in all the printing trades of California.
Resolved, That the San Francisco Printing
Pressmen's Union so view the situation and
hold Governor Budd responsible lor having
struct the severest blow at organized labor
that ha* ever been dealt them in this State.
Besotted, That a copy of these resolutions be
furnished the press of the State ana to sister
unions, under our seal and the signatures of
our proper officers.

DOCTORS TALK AND DINE.
Interesting Proceedings at Yes
terday's Sessions of the
Medical Society.
Technical Papers Foil t we 1 by a Ban
quet at the Palace
Hotel.
Yesterday was the last session but
one of the Medical Society of California.
The proceedings were quite technical
througbont, but some of the business re
lated to the society itself.
There was a proposition to amend the
constitution by reducing the annual dues
from $. r > to $3 and to do away with the in
itiation fee of $2. When President Gib
bons placed the proposition before the
i convention yesterday morning Dr. K. H.
Plummer asked that the amendment
might be divided in order that the two
propositions which it contained might be
Toted on separately. He was one of the
committee on increase of membership
which had reported the amendent, but
this was done, he explained, in deference
to requests received from a number of
members of tne society and not because
the committee really favored the proposed
reduction in the annual dues. On the
proposition to abolish the Initiation fees,
however, he thought there would be little
opposition manifested.
T: c amendment was divided, as Dr.
l'lumnier had asked, and the proposition
to reduce the annual dues was defeated by
unanimous vote. The motion to abolish
the initiation fee was carried, only one
member opposing.
Duriug the morning Dr. Granvilie Me-
Gowan of Los Angeles read an imerestine
paper on the value of "Fort's Method of
E.cctroiysis" in certain cases, also exhib
iting a few instruments for the application
of t c process.
There were several other papers on the
morning programme, among them "Prac
tical Value of the Study of Blood," by
Dr. J. A. Sanderson of St. Helena; "A
Brief Summary of tbe Bacteriological
Work in the Laboratory of the Health
Office." by John C. Spencer of this City;
"A Case of Extensive Leucoplasia of the
Mouth, Eventuating in Epithelioma of
the Cheek," by Drs. D. W. Montgomery
and H. M. Sherman of San Francisco.
Ttie alternoon wus devoted largely to a
discussion of diaeas.es of children. The
iollowlng additional programme consti
tuted the afternoon work:
"Some Unusual Forms of Laryngeal Paraly
sis." by J. Dennis Arnold, San Francisco, dis
cussion opened by George H. Powers, San

MERELY RUMORS
Pastor Hughe* of the Xiipa Baptist
Church Exonerated.
The following are the findings of the
councilof investigation called by the Napa
Baptiit Church at the earnest request of
its pastor, to determine the ministerial
standing of Rev. T. B. Hughes:
The council convened at the call of the Bap
tist Church of Xapa met in the building of the
Church at 7:30 P.M., April 1!>, and was cuni
posed of ministers and others invited by the
church to investigate the Christian character
and ministerial staudingof Rev. T- B. Hughes,
Hie pastor of the church, and the following is
the finding of said council :
First â That in response to a card published
in the Napa Daily Journal, under date of April
17, 1897, as follows:
"Notice is hereby given that a council of In
vestigation will be held hi Napa Baptist
church on Monday, April 19, &i 7:30 r. M.
Those who have charges to preier against the
pastor affecting his moral character are in
vited to present their proofs to the council at
tnat time. The Committee.
Another special effort resulted in no specific
charges belli? made that were derogatory to
the Christian character ana ministerial stand
ing of Brother T. B. Hughes, but we found cer
tain vague rumors in circulation.
Second â That we made a tnorough and care
ful investigation of these rumors.
Thirdâ That we lind nothing affecting the
standing of Rev. T. B. Hughes as a Christian
and minister of the gospel.
Fourthâ We commend our Brother Hughes
to the community, the church and Baptist de
nomination at large aa a man worthy of confi
dence aud respect.
Fifthâ We commend the Napa Baptist
Cuurch for its loyalty to Us pastor under these
trying circumstances.

THREE FAVORITES,
THREE OUTSIDERS
A Tied Score, in Which
the Talent Was
Worsted.
Some Heavily Piayed Choices
Went Amiss at Ingle
side Track.
Pat Murphy in Fine Fettleâ Addie
Buchanan First at 10 to I
Lou! on R a Snrprise.
The track at Ingleside f,or some reason
has been harrowed up until it is about as
fast as a merry-go-round in some sand
lot, and as a consequence form players
the past few days have found themselves
in sad nraits. Horses that did not figure
a chance have galloped in and others
which looked "castirons" suffered that
weary feeling long before the wire was
reached. It has not increased the popu
larity of racing at the local course one
whit, and the sooner the management
become apprised of this fact the better it
will be for the future of the game.
Three favorites and three outsiders
drew down purses yesterday, but so ex
pensive was the defeat of the last three
choices that the talent left for home with
just about enough coin to purchase a small
package of climate and a ride to the ocean
beach.
The opening two-year-old scramble at
four furlongs was gathered in by the 4 to
5 favorite, The Cheat, ridden by Jimmy
Bozeman. Malka, a 20 to 1 outsider, led
the bunch until well into the stretch,
where the first choice assumed the lead
and won handily, three parts of a length
in advance of Outlay, against which 8 to 1
was laid.
After receding in the betting from 3 to 2
to 11 to 5 the roan sprinter, Pat Murphy,
took the six-furlong sprint next decided
very easily. Nervcso raced witn him to
the stretch, where he drew away, win ning
hands down from the hard-ridden second
choice Mobalaska. The 20 to 1 shot
Palmerston secured the show. Kowalsky
was left at the post.
Starting an 8 to 5 choice, the one and a
sixteenth miles run proved an easy thing
for Vinctor, piloted by Willie Martin.
Una Colorado made most of the running,
but was easily outiooied to the stand by
the first choice, which won by less than a
length, with pounds to spare. Marcel
finished a distnni third. Pepper was
quite extensively backed, but his bad legs
gave way ana he finished among the
"a; so rans."
Veiox, a son of The Hook, was made an
8 to 5 choice for the fourth event, a mile
sellinp affair, and although showing con
siderab> speed could finish no better than
third. Thompson hustled Charlemagne,
which opened at 8 to 5 and went back to
2}4 t<> 1, out in front and Schreiber's horse
was never heaiied, passing the finishing
line a length in front of Two Cheers, a 5 to
1 choice, with Willie Martin in the saddle.
J<>: X showed some speed, butdied away in
the stretch.
The finish to the mile that followed was
a most exciting one, Addie BuciiananVin
ning by a length, with Joe Terry. Day
lipht, San Marco and Mercutio stretched
across the track heads apart. The win
ner, ridden by Eddie Jones, was 10 to 1 in
the bettintr. Nebula and Mercutio cut out
tne pace to the straightaway for home,
wliere the pace told on both of them.
Aa outsider, Loulou R, captured the
last, race of the day, over seven furlongs.
Tne mare was a 10 to 1 shot in the betting
and after setting the pace from the jump
downed Adam Andrew a head in a hard

GEINDING OUT DIVOECES.
Activity In the Business or Dividing
DUcordttut. Hearts.
The divorce industry is active in the
different departments of the Superior
Court of the City and County of San
Francisco at the present time.
Soon a law will go into effect requiring
divorced people to wait a year before re
entering the holy state of matrimony. It
frequently happens that the interested
I parties dislike to wait so km* as that.
Consequently there is a movement all
along the line to accelerate the disposi
tion of divorce litigation.
Last week quite a record was made
when a complaint was tiled on Thursday
and a decree of divorce was secured on
Friday. Both parties thought it a lucky
day, so the public apparently has no right
to romplain.
Wednesday disclosed the usual business
doing, "with prospects for ihe outloos
being firmer," as tne commercial reports
would say.
Divorces have been granted as follows:
James Burns from Laura Burns, for deser
tion.
Charlotte R. Deckelman from Louis Deckel
man, the reason assigned being extreme
cruelty.
X A. Garratt from J. H. Garratt, for deser
11UU. fe
Herman Knumin from Bertha Rauman, on
thÂ» ground oi cruelty.
George W. Parslow from Amelia Parslow,
because of her desertion and extreme cruelty.
Henrietta J. Zimmerman from William B.
Zimmerman, for willful ueglect.
Margaret J. Jones from Cnarles P. Jones, on
trte ground oi desertiou.
Suits for divorce have been filed as fol
lows: Mary Olsen ajjainst August Olsen,
for cruelty; Lincoln A. Coffin against
Hannah Collin, for cruelty.
Held for Burglary,
George Riley was yesterday held to answer
before tne Superior Court by nctiug I'olice
Judge Kerrltjan in $2000 bonds on the charge
of burglary. He broke into the house of
George Gattsman. 404 Stockton street, January
27, and stcjje a gold watch and other articles.
Riley was also held a few days ago by Judge
Joachimsen to answer ou the charge of mur
dering William Heuneisey in the St. iiavid
House.
The City Is lim.-j.
Since the great retiring sale of the Paragon
Suit Company has been announced the whole
town is full of life. It is no wonder, when the
finest kinds of dresses are thrown away at
$150 each, $1 laundried waists at 25c, $20

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 23, 1897.
THE X RAY AND
SEDLITZ POWDERS
Doctors Lsarn How the Dose
Blows Up the
Stomach.
There's a Fizz and in Two Sec
onds That Slave Is Like
a Balloon.
Dr. Abrams Stands a Patient Up an :
Watches Things Work While
the Dose Go s Dew i.
The X ray has recently been tamed by
a prominent lecal physician onto Bedlitz
powders after they have been taken, and
the surprising result has been pictured
before the State Medical Association now
in session.
The discovery hat been made that the
â tomacb is almost instantly distended to
four or five times its eize before taking,
being blown up suddenly like a balloon,
dislocating the heart and boosting the
other oreans generally into their corners.
This, in unscientific terms, is the effect
of the revelation briefly stated oy Dr. Al
bert Abrams, who is a member of the
faculty of Cooper Medical College and
who divided with Dr. Philip Mills Jones
the session of Tuesday evening when the
This Shows the Human Stomach
Before and After a Fizzing
Seidlitz Powder.
X ray was discussed before the associa
tion.
This dynamic action of sedlitz powders
was one of the least important from a
medical point of view of the things which
Dr. Abrams demonstrated from the or
iginal experiments with the X ray which
he has carried on, but it was the one most
calculated to exc.te a layman's curious in
terest.
The doctors have never known before
to what dimensions the stomach is blown
up by this frequently taken mess. They
knew that the gases generated would dis
tend the stomach, but as the stomach Is
in a state of collapse on the autopsy table
its excursions on sedlitz powder and simi
lar occasions remained unsuspected.
But Dr. Abrams recently backed a pa
tient up a ainst a Crookes tube in opera
tion and had the patient swallow a sedlitz
powder. When the dose went down the
stomach was plainly outlined in the
fluoroscope in its normal size and posi
tion. When the draught entered the
stomach the sudden expansion was plainly
and beautifully seen.
The accompanying diagram is repro
duced from the one Dr. Abrams displayed
on the screen. The smaller figure repre
sents the stomach before taking and the
larger one its outline a few seconds later.
In its swelling upward it, of course,
pushed the diaphragm before it, crowding
on the heart and iunga. Before taking the
heart was plainly and completely seen as
a dense shadow. After the expansion and
its change of position it snowed a much
smaller blotch of shadow.
The position of tne distended stomach
gives a better understanding of the sudden
deaths that sometimes occur immediately
after very hearty meals. In such canes
the heart is weak and the pressure and
change of position resulting from the
forcing upward of the heart und dia
phragm result fatally.
The experiment illustrates the increas
ing knowledge of physiological actions
which the X ray fives when organs are
warned by iis aid. It affords new dis
coveries and demonstrates what was but
theoretical before.
In his demonstration Dr. Abrams dis
played diagrams of the normal heart and
lungs and then diagrams showing heart
enlargements revealed by the fluoroscopc.
He stated that in treating a recent case of
enlarged heart by Schott's gymnastic
method, he noted the size of the organ *t
the start, and later a reduction of one
fifth as tue treatment progressed.
The beating of the heart can now be
plainly seen as a twinkling of the dark
yet well-outlined shadow, which is seen
through the spaces between the ribs, at
behind bars, and the position of the beat
ing heart and ihe outline of any enlarge
ment can be seen at a glance. It is a great
thing for the doctors to be able to stand a
man up and look through him to see how
things are working.
ROBIN SON ON TRIAL.
Charged With Embezzling 911,000 of
the Funds of the Bernard
Estate.
Attorney C. P. Robinson, charged with
felony embezzlement, appeared for trial
in Department 12 of tae Superior Court
yesterday, Jud-e Webb of Fresno sitting
for Judge Carroll Cook, who is holding
court in Fresno.
The accusation against Robinson is that
he absorbed several thousand dollars be
longing to the estate of the late Charles
Bernard. The dispute arose out of the
management of the property which he
controlled as trustee tor Mrs. Clarisse
Bernard, surviving widow of the de
ceased, who was a prominent dealer in
coffee and spices.
When RobniÃon was ready to settle his
accounts he ligured that ne owed tne
estate a certain amount, but Mrs. Bernard
claimed a much larger sum and took the
mailer before the Grand Jury. An in
dictment was found January 9 1895
$11,000, and the case hae been nangin* on
the calendar ever since.
Attorney J. J. Dwyer appeared as spe
cial counsel to assist Deputy District At
torney Hosmer in the prosecution, while
Dunne & MtPike represent the defendant
following are tne names of the jurors
selected to try the case: Julius Scbencel
?r Cn w h a w c "' J r 08 o P& Orr ' Adam Ulm
br., Jacob Weise, J. Bremer, George Lake
John Noonan, George Â£. Knief, James
Dewing, Walter Hinkley and Peter Jonn-
Attorney Dunne at every stage of the
proceedings put in a claim that the trou
ble rrew oat of a difference of opinion in
Â£?3VÂ°f k" that Robinson was en
titled to for ' his serÂ»ices. On the other
fnor * Â¥'' , Dwy V u arKUed that Robinson
too* advantage of hi. client to the extent
alleged in the indictment v ' Â«iÂ«ii
The day was taken up with the ~testl>
mony of T. V. Maxwell, an expert in
bookkeeping. It is expected that t :Â«e trial
will last nearly a week.
An additional indictment charging Rob
inson with perjury in connection with the
â¢ame proceedings is also pending.
Judge Webb is a very strict disciplin
arian. He ciided Deputy District Attor
ney Hosmer for being tnree minutes late
yesterday morning, and when Mr. Hos
mer sought to excr.se himself by an alle
â  aiion tuat the courtroom clock was too
fast his Honor calmly replied: "This
court's clock i< exactly right, so far as
this court is concerned, and all officers of
this court are required io take notice of
that fact. Proceed, gentlemen."
Mr. Hosmer, it was observed, became
exceedingly self-contained after this collo
quy, a condition that was not lessened in
its intensity when Judge Webb, with a
far-away look in his eyes, incidentally re
marked that he would send io jail the
next lawyer, young or old. who made an
exhibition of temper while taking an ex
ception to the rulings of the court.
Judge Webb is said to have an enviable
record for ability and firmness as well as
fairness in his own bailiwick, but however
that may be, it is sure that be has im
pressed the lawyers of San Francisco as a
man not to be fooled with, and hereafter
he will live in the memories of local legal
historians as "the buzz-saw Judge from
Fresno."
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.
Local Merchants ltrachin e Out to Ex
tend Their Field of Opera
tion.
In accordance with the decision of the
members of the Chamber of Commerce at
its last meeting the movement toward in
creasing the trade of this City with the
countries on the west coast of South
America has been set on ioot. Yesterday
the following address or circular was sent
to a large number of the business men :
Tn the Merchants of San Franciscoâ Gentle
men: The mture prosperity of our Eeapori
largely depending upon our ocean commerce,
wo respectfully suggest that special rff.Â»rts
hnou'd be made to increase it. We have al
ready Initiated iiiccessiul action in respect to
trade with Japan and Central Ani-nca, and,
in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce
at Its isesslon on tne 20th laaC, we now Invite
you to organize for the development of trade
with the west coast of fcoutti America. A
recent reduction In freights and the possibility
of still lower rates remove the greatest ini
pedlment. The time appears propitious.
The bearer.*ereof, J. B. Havrr, a gentleman
well informed by experience and personal oL
nervatlon in regard to thin trade, will call
upon yon, and when the promise of attend
ance has been secured a meeting will be called
*t the rooms of the cnambar to organize for
the work. We respectfully suggest that your
action should be prompt nnd decisive. With
much respect, your obedient servants,
Louis b. Parrott,
Leon Blum,
Chablks Nelson,
Committee on Foreign Commerce.
William L. Merry, Secretary and Trensurer.
As indicated the proposition is io follow
the same plan as that now in operation
in Japan. An abie business man, repre
senting fifteen San Francisco business
houses, is at work in Japan introcucinj;
tne goods and wares of his employer, be
sides furnishing the Chamber of Com
merce with such information as will be of
immediate or future benefit. Aa so >n a*
possible another man will be sent to
South America for the same purpose. He
will probably start out in two or thrÂ»e
weeks. Already a number of large nrms
dealing in such commodities as could be
handled to advantage in the western
South American countries have slumtied
their de<ire to be represented by ;he
chamber's representative.
An international exhibition of gastron
omy and of culinary art is to take plHce at
Vienna in 1898, in honor of the fiftieth an
niversary of t lie reign of ihe Emperor of
Austria-Hurieary.

Taking of Evidence in the
Fair Case Not Yet
Started.
MR. DELM AS ALARMS HIS
OPPONENTS.
He Filed an Answer That Was
Most Difficult to
Down.
THE INTERVENOR'S POSITION
DEFINED.
When the Debite Finally Ended Mr.
Pierson Made tha P aintiffs'
Openin? Address.
That particular array of attorneys who
have gathered in Judge Siack's court to
dispute Mrs. Nettie R. Craven's claim to
ATTORNEY DELMAS Interrupts Mr; Pierson's Opening Address in the Fair Case.
two valuable pieces of property which she !
asserts wvre deeded to her by the late
Senator Fail, were treated to something
of a scare yesterday when the proceed iugs
in the great caÂ«e were resumed.
Ft was D. If. Del mas of Mrs. Craven's
counsel who exploded the shell that
caused the consternation, and it took the
opposing side the entire forenoon and a
pood part of the afternoon to wriggle out
of their dilemma. And it was all over an
innocent-looking little document that Mr.
Delmas filed with the clerk as soon as
Judge Slack declared court open, and
asked ti at it be made a part of the record.
This document was the answer of the
fielense to the complaint .in the case as it
was amended 'Wednesday afternoon by
the counsel fur tua plaintiffs. True, the
latter only essayed to correct a little error
in the complaint, but it gave the defense
the opening desired, and it was taken
advantage of in a twinkling. The answer
wns not what the plaintiffs' side bad
expected, for instead of being an elaborate
reproduction of the defense's cross-cor
n it was merely a denial of the
i haree3 in the complaint. It w*s ac
knowledged to be a clever stroke, for on its
lace, it seerued to deprive the legal
champions for the Fair estate executors of
tue best part of their threatened thunder.
It would narrow the great case down to a
fimple little trial to quiet title.
When these gentlemen t>ad recovered
from their surprise Â«they assumed an air
of nonchalance, and Air. Pierson, just to
show that he was not alarmed, remarked
to the court that ne supposed the trial
would be proceeded with immediately.
"But what about this change in the sit
uation ?" asked nis Honor.
"We see no cnange, your Honor," said
Mr. Pierson.
Judge Black devoted at least ten min
utes of careful study to the documents in
the case.
"My impression is," he said finally,
'that the situation here is very much
changed."
Mr. Pierson said he hoped not â in fact,
he thought be could convince bis Honor
that he was mistaken. The attorney then
proceeded to elucidate by declaring that
the issue was unquestionably the so-called
eouilable defense to Mrs. Craven's cross
complaint.
"How do you make it out that under
'lie present circumstances tbpre is still a
cross-complaint," slyly asked Mr. Delmas.
Attorney Charles Wheeler was up in an
instant with an inquiry as to whether or
not the defense had withdrawn its cross
<on> plaint.
"Our answer to your emended com
) !aint is quite clear,"' replied Mr. Delmas,
with a tantalizine smile.
iJ -'â¢ Wheeler turned appealiagly to the
court and asked that Mr. Dslma? be in
structed to announce whether or not he
had withdrawn ;he cross-complaint.
Mr. Delmas was fairly twinkling with
satisfaction over the discomfiture and
worry of the other side, and when pressed
by Wheeler for a statement referred him
again to the answer a 9 being sufficiently
clear lor the nvÂ»ruee man of inteliicence.
Judge Sack, doubtless wilh the view of
drawing Mr. Delmas into making an ex
tended statement of his position, said that
he waÂ« not quita sure, but he had an idea
that the answer and theamendnient would
not disturb the cross-complaint.
Sure enough, this had the effect desired,
for Mrs. Craven's chiel legal champion at
once took the floor. The origiual com
plaint in the case, he declared, was to quiet
title to the property at Sansorne and Pine
streets, of which property, the plaintiff
claim, Senator Fair way at the time of his
death the owner in lee simple absolute.
That complaint averred also ihat the de
iADdant, Mrs. Craven, had made an ad
verse claim to the property and a suit to
quiet title resulted.
"It is now discovured," continued coun
sel, "that an error was committed in de
scribing the property mentioned. To
their amended complaint we have the
right to reply as we see fit, and we have
done so. This is now a 6imple action to
quiet title."
The debate now became cenera!, and
authorities were quoted liberally. It
came to a close at 1 o'clock, when a recess
was ordered.
Judge Slack said, in conclusion, that he
thought Mr. Delmas was right in his
claims, but he preferred to consider his
books before deciding the point finally.
At the opening of the afternoon session
Attorney Delmas announced that after a
conference with his associates during the
recess the decision had been reached that
under the amended complaint the defense
had no further use for its cross-complaint,
and he therefore notified the court that
that instrument had been withdrawn.
Counsel for the plaintiffs evidently an
ticipated this move, for no sooner had Mr.
Delmas finished speaking than Mr.
Wheeler poppei up, lawbook in hand,
and said that the plaintirfs denied the
right of the defense to make the desired
withdrawal.
Judge Slack said be feared that a mis
understanding existed betwsen Mr. Del
mas and himself. He had not heard it
intimated, he saLJ, that affirmative relief
was asked for in the answer, as it was now
apparent Mr. Delmas intended.
The stenographic report of the morning
proceedings was called into requisition to
show that the court bad practically told
the attorneys for the defense thai they
could withdraw the cross-complaint.
"I did think this morning that counsel
had the right to withdraw it," interposed
Judge Slact. "but I have since consulted
the code, Â«nd I lind that such a course is
not permissible."
Mi. Del mas argued again, but the court
j would not change its ruling. So the cross
complaint will stand.
Attorney Pierson then made the open
: ing addrea to the court and jury for the
plaintiffs. For a long time prior to his
1 death, said the attorney, Senator Fair
was the acknowledged owner of the two
i parcels of property now in dispute. Upon
| bis death be left a will in which he be
queathed this property along with others
to his children. In this will be also made
j the avowal that be was not married, and
j was the father of no children other than
i those mentioned in the document, and
| declared further that all of the property
enumerated was his own and nobody had
any claim on it. Thin will was executed
on* September 21,1804. On December 2S
of the same year Senator Fair died.
Mr. Pier.'on began to warm up now, and
was going on to relate that Senator Fair,
just before bis death, gave instructions
that his will should be filed "the moment
the breath left his body," when Mr. Del
mas made an emphatic objection to any
such declarations being made in court.
Judge Slack agreed with Mr. Delmas
and promptly informed Mr. Pierson thai
he was supping over the bounds and must
desist. ;
"Gentlemen of the jury," said his Honor,
turning to the twelve men in the box,
"you will understand that this is merely
an opening statement. You must not
look upon it as evidence." â¢ j
When Mr. Pierson resumed he devoted
his remarks by telling the jury what an
awfully bad woman they were" going to
prove Mr?. Craven to be. Mrs. Craven, he
said, went to Reuben H. L'oyd and
George A. Knight and said she had in her
possession a will executed by Senator
Fair later than the document tiled by the
millionaire's executors. This will did not
leave the heirs so seriously handicapped
as did the first one, so a. contract was
drawn up whereby Mrs. Craven was to be
paid $500,000 if she would produce tue will
and it should be found genuine.
. Mr. Pierson at this point grew argumen
tative again and was once mote taken to
task by the court. In fact all through his
address- be had to be continually inter
rupted by Judge black and cautioned by
him to bn more fair.
Mr. Pierson Â«rot into deep water again
before he bad said a dozen worts. He
attempted to have the "lead-pencil" will
{ â town to the jury.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 23, 1897.
"Not until after the document ban been
introduced in evident?," said the court.
"We dr>n't believe it ever will be," spoke
up Mr. DeuEon, one of Mrs. Craven's at
torneys.
Mr.Pierson cat his address rather short
after tuat. He told the jury that he and
his associates expected to prove that the
"lead-penciL" will was a forgery; that
was the sum and substance of the whole
story. One of their strong points, he said,
would be the showing that Senator Fair
on the Utith of November, 1894, republished
his will, and also provided a trust fund
with which any contest of his will should
be fought. Finally it would be proved, he
declared, that the deeds held by Mrs.
Craven were also invalid.
It was remarked as a significant fact
that in his opening address to the jury
Mr. Pieison had nothing to say about tue
forgery of the deeds. The Fair people
had said again and aeain that they would
place their lingers on the forger, and tell
where, and how, and why ana when the
crime was committed. But they did noth
ing of the Kind. Mr. Pierson spoke only
about the facts, or alleged facts, that are
already familiar to the public mind, and
on the BUDj^ct of the forgery and the
forcers was mute.
Mr. Delmas asked for and was granted
the privilege of making the defense's open
ing address before tue taking of evidence
began, but as the hour was now late an
adjournment was taken until Monday
morning, at which time he will speak.

PICTURES

COLORS
A San Francisco Genius
Has Won the Secret,
Too.
MAY SOON STARTLE THE
WORLD.
He Can Make Nature Put All
Her Varied Hues on
Paper.
METHOD SIMPLER THAN THE
FEENCHM&K'S.
The Discov ry Is but Awaiting a
Final Perfection, for Which
Ha Is Struggling.
San Francisco is about to startle the
world with that long-expected marvel,
photography in natural colors.
M. Chassogne, a Parisian, haÂ« really
accomplished this scientific feat by pro
cesses that are his own secrets. Two
months or bo ago the success of Chas
sague's invention became the scientific
sensation of Europe, and the sensation is
still on. Yesterday some of these pictures
were shown for the first time in America
j when they were exhibited on Broadway,
i New York, and with the appearance of the
pictures everywhere the sensation will be
intensified.
Here in San Francisco a young scientist
is making photographs in natural colors
by a method that will make Chassagne's
wonder get off the earth into the histories
when it is got to working just exactly
rizht.
Tall assertion is made on the authority
of T. P. Andrew?, a well-known photo
graphic dealer and expert, and on* or two
! others. The inventor's name is a secret,
I as is his process, bat the fellow has nailed
the principle and has produced colored
photographs that are wonderful, it is
said.
By Cha=sagne's method an ordinary
sensitized plate is first treated by immer
sion in a secret solution/ Then fit is usad
in the ordinary way, and when developed
cannot be told from an ordinary negative.
The print is made from this . negative in
the orlinary way,, but on a sensitized
; paper treated wiui that same mysterious
solution. This print, agnin, shows noth
ing different from tue ordinary one. This
print is then passed successively through
thiee colored solutionsâ blue, . green and
red. The mysterious solution with which
the paper was treated has given it a power
of selection by which it takes up the
exact amount of each color present in the
subject of the photograph. So perfectly
is this done that every tint and shade is
reproduced. â¢ . . t â '..â¢â 
'Our man is working on an entirely
different principle," said Mr. Andrews,
i while speaking cautiously, yesterday, and
| his method ii vastly more" simple. He
' says that his discovery is based on prin
| ciples of light and chemistry quite differ
| ent from those of the Frenchman." '
A year ago, as the reliable story is gath
ered, this local inventor who had for many
years been an expert amateur photographic
crank, had hit upon the secret of and had
made photographs in colors. He was pen
niless, wanted capital, and went to Mr.
| Andrews, who talkeii with one or two men
of large means. It was a business propo
sition wholly. The pictures were crude
and the process complicated and uncer
tain, though the principle and possibility
were there.
> The French invention has already been
sold to an English syndicate, which will
supply the plates, paper and liquids and
sell territorial rights to sell them. The
value of .the invention may. be judged
j from the fact that the company has juÂ»t
refused Â£30,000 or nearly $150,000 for the
I right to Germany, besides paying a royalty
on all sales. The 1 quids are to be manu
factured exclusively in Paris by M. Chas
sagne and shipped thence to the branch
1 establishments all over the world. .

and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south alon: th.' coast, rain Is probable:
but when the "low 1 - Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of<Â»re?on is improb
able. With a "hieh" in the vicinity of Idaho, anil
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
Â»eÂ»tfcer mÂ»y be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

Recent Decisions Regarding Charges
cf Professional! m Hastened
t! c EnJ.
Oakland Office sak Francisco Call,)
908 Broudway, April 22. j
The Acme Athletic Club has decided to
withdrew from the Pacific Coast Associa
tion of the Amateur Athletic Union.
This decision has been reached because
the directors believe it would be better for
Pacific Coast athletics if an independent
organization wan to bo formed in this
State.
"Our reasons for withdrawal," said Sec
retary Cook of the Acme to-day, "are
many. Our directors have been for some
months of the unanimous opinion that a
State or coast organization entirely inde
pendent in its managnient from the
Eastern association could better advance
the interests 01 all amateur sports on the
coast.
"Our members are purely and distinctly
amateurs, and no organization has been
more jealous of its amateur standing than
the Acme Athletic Cub. All our atten
tion as directors has been devoted to the
development of our athletes on amateur
lines, and we consistently oppose any
action that would tend toward profession
alism, it being a well-known fact that we
hare never at any time offered a purse for
a contest of any description between pro
fessionals,
'Under the rules of the present associa
tion no trophy of a greater value than $35
could be offered fur an amateur contest,
and Dotbing allowed for training ei
j coses. This we have always held to be
wrong, as it was impossible to secure
matfctoes between good ama.eurs for such
atroph.v.and as we advocated the neces
sity of offering more valuable prizes to
contestants we have been charged with
I>rofes3:onalbm. It should be obvious to
any man of reason that a reasonable
amount for training expense-s should bt
al.owed to put a man in proper physical
condition for entering the ring.
'â¢The immediate reasons for our with
drawal were the receni boxing order of
ihe eseodation by which they refused to
aiiow or countenance any boxing contest
whatever, the registration of all amateurs
Â«t a fixed fee and the withdrawal of the
Olympic Club. Steps will immediately be
taken toward forming a new organization
that will be more Id sympathy with the
condition of amateur athletics on this
coas'. and capaule of administering its own
affairs. Its members will be taken from
the leading legitimate atiJetic clubs of
t tie coast, and will probably include,
among others, the Olympic, Acme, Re
liance, Stockton, Sacramento, Fresno and
Los Angeles clubs.

Slated.
Forty-Fonr Men Wi.l Enter, Which
Is Thirteen More Than Ever
Entered B fore.
BERKELEY, Cal.. April 22.â Track
Manager Barnes announced the entry list
this afternoon of California men for the
intercollegiate fieid day, which will take
place next Saturday afternoon. Forty
fonrmen will be pitted against the Stan
ford aggregation, which is thirteen more
than entered last year. Saturday's list
will be the largest ever entered by Berke
ley in a field day. Speculation is rife as
to the outcome of the contest, witn honors
about even. Under the schedule of points
adoiv.ed the general impression is the
result of the games will be a toss-up.
Competent judges of the ability of both
teams concede eight first places to Stan
ford and six to Berkeley. They believe
the Palo Alto boys will take the 100, the
1220, the 440, the half mile, the broad jump,
the vault, the hammer and the high jump,
leaving to the blue and go:d the mile run,
the mile walk, both hurdles, the bicycle
race and the shot put. What the Ber
keley men lose in first places they expect
to make up in second.
The bicycle race will be held at the
Velodrome at 1 o'clock and the other
events at the Olympic ground?, comment
ing at 2:30 o'clock. Foilowing is Berke
ley's complete entry list:

SPEAKS TO SIUDENTS.
Gfncral Barnes Glts* the University
Cadets a Little \Vordly Wisdom.
BERKELEY, Cal., April General
W. H. L. Barnes gave the University
Cadets this afternoon a few ideas on why
they should look upon military duty with
more favor. With an incidental, humor
ous reference to the absence of the ex
pected audience last Tuesday, when the
ire!" hies and sophs "cut" drill to attend
to Bourdon matters, he proceeded to talk
drill and college work in general.
He said that he believed the next cen
tury would be the most remarkable the
world has ever seen, and that the oppor
tunities for young men to-day are limit
lees.
"You don't like drill," said he, and the
nfp-room fairly rung with applause.
Most Complexion Powders
have a vulgar glare, but Pozzoni's is a true
beautifier .whose effects are lasting . j
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
"But the State has the right to eiDÂ»ct
military service of those who are educated
at pubic expense."
General Barnes expressed a poor opin
ion of the college "dis," and said ne
would not give much for a man who was
all study and no exercise. He referred to
Grant as a man who while at West Point
was under continuous discipline and who
graduated Xo. 26 in a class of thirty-one,
but who .it the s-ame time had in him the
elements of fame.
As to Athletics, the speaker said he
would rather be ab'.e to throw the ham
mer the greatest distance of any man in
college than be the best in Ureek conju
gation, â 'iriSnit

WAR AGAINST FLOWDR3.
Doctor* Talk About 1 heir Admission
to Sickrooms and Hospitals.
OAKLAND, Cal.. April 22.âConsidera
ble discussion has taken place of late be
cause of a report that has reached hers
from Sir Morel Mackenzie of London. The
report states that it is very detrimental to
patients ir. hospitals or sickrooms to hare
flowers in the room. Ail kinds of horri
ble germ and bacil i i stories are told and
the matter has been agitated by some of
the local doctors, especially in connection
with Fabiola Hospi'al, to which flowers
are freely sent every day.
D-. Crow ley of the State Board of Health
when asked for an opinion on the matter
Dr. D. D. Crowley Thinks Pro
fessional Men Should Not
Discuss Trifles.
poohpoohed the whole idea. "Time in too
valuable attending to matters of import
ance to warrant a discuÂ»sion on any sucn
trivial matter as flowers in a sicicroom. No
one supposes that flowers are left in a
sicicroom till they become rotten and the
water becomes stagnant, an 1 I think that
instead of raising a fuss about such a trifle
members of a learned profession can de
vote their energy and time to matters of
much more gravty."

OAKLAND. Cal., April 22.â The Ala
meda County Board of Fire Underwriters
has decided that no brokerage or commis
sion will herealter be paid by agents
within the jurisdiction of the board un
less they were duly accredited or certifi
cated brokers.
The decision was alto arrived at thai
the compensation to such brokers should
be the same as is paid in San Francisco.
Fur a long time, it is claimed, people
have interfered by taking business to an
insurance agent that would naturally
have gone to him and then demanding
commission*. This is the practice that
the board desires to break up. and here
of ter no agent who does not hold a certifi
cate will be allowed to solicit business or
receive commissions.

Always striving for something original,
Oakland has now decided that she will
have a cat show with her dog show. At
the last meeting of the club it was defi
nitely decided that russy should have a
chance to exhibit her wool and purring
abilities, as well as the bowwows.
No entry fee will be charged exh bitors
of cats, and the only expense to wh.ch

Dog Show.
the owners will be put is tbat of benching
and feeding. In this State, more bo than
in many otberc, there are people who
bare made % f-pecialty of breeding cats,
and they own many valuable Angoras
and Maltese. It has been decided to pto
them an opportunity to show iheir pets,
and prices will be awarded to the lucky
ones.
Dr. Fred Pierce, the city veterinary
surgeon, will be judpe of the cats, and in
thi-> line hÂ« is well known ali over the
country at a very efficient arbiter.
The bench show will open the second
week of next month at the Exposition
building. It is attracting as much atten
tion all over the Siate among owner* of
thoroughbred dogs as the show of the
San Francisco Bench Club. In this city
there are many prominent dog-fanciers
and they will put all their pets on exhibi
tion.
It is est mated thnt there will be 330
entries, including a sp-cial string of sixty
magnificent St. Bernards. Dog-I>reeders
in Stockton, Sacramento, San JoÂ«e, Los
Angeles and the adjoining States are also
sending animals.
The California Collie Club of Snn
JosÂ« has offered gold medals for the best
two California-bred collies. These prizes
are to be competed for only by the mem-
Den of the Collie Club.
Among the cats will be some fine ani
mals imported from Europe, and one ex
hibitor has entered twelve Angoras of re
markable Deauty. No ordinary house cats
will be accepted, as all animals must be
thoroughbred so secure recognition.
BRIGHT CHERRY OUTLOOK.
Experts Report a Crop Which Will
Be Three Time* a* Large
a* Last Year.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908" Broadway, April 22. f ".
The present indications of Hie cherry
crop In this county are that it will be an
exceptionally fine onÂ». A great portion
of the orchards from San Leandro to Niles
are cherry orchards, and for five miles
nothing can now be seen but thousands of
cherry trees in full blossom. Within a
radius of two and a half miles there are
over 55,000 trees in full bloom, and every
tree is described at being "one preat snow
ball."
An examination of the blossoms lias
been made, and it is stated thai about
one-third of them is showing fruit and if
this be realized the trees will have all the
cherries they can possibly carry, la many
orchards trees that have not produced
more than three to five boxes a season
will from the present showing yield ten
to fifteen boxes. I. H. Beiger of San
Leandro, who has leased seventeen
orchards, including 20,000 tree-", expects a
t:ood crop and estimates that be will han
dle about 150 ton*.
All the varieties of cherries are equally
good in appearance and this is quite un
common. Great improvement Has been
made in pruning cherry trees in the past
few years, and as a result the Inside limbs
are heavily laden with blossoms. This re
sult has partly been obtained by scientific
methods of sprarincr. Experts estimate
the crop in the vicinity between Elm hurst
and San Lorenzo at not lets than 1100 tons
for the season. Cherries are always sure
of a market, as home prices can be en
tirely controlled by Eastern shipments,
and this knowledge has rendered cherry
growers comparatively independent. The
canneries are already burins all that are
offered for sale, but the growers are de
manding good prices. Many improve
ments have been made in regard to ship-
Ding, and the cherry-growers are rery con
fident of a successful season.
HOWARD'S NEW DILEMMA.
Release I on Â» Charge of Murder, a
Wife Now Appears.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 22.â Jack How
ard, the motormun who was acquitted yes
terday for complicity in the murder of
Anna Johnson, will probably have to
make an explanation.
District Attorney Snook has received a
letter from Orovillo signed by Mrs. C. V.
Howard.' It ii as follows; "
Will you kindly inform me If John A. How
ard is n divorced man or not? I was his legal
wiie, if I am not so yet. I never had no no

is not h divorced m-in I would like to send you
a piece that he ( ut in the paper about inc.
which I can prove Is a falsehood, and I would
like your advice about it, and oblige me by
answering this note immediately. Yours re

County, Cal.
All throuen the trial over the death of
Anna Johnson, Howard has alwavn ap
peared as t!;e iover oi the dead gin's -is
ter, Httidah, and it has frequently bfen
slated by both of them that a marri. gÂ«?
would soon take place. As a matter of
::ict, it is not yet known whether or not
Huldah Johnson und Howard are legally
man and wife, in which event there^may
yet be a case of bigamy to be examined
into.
GREATER OAKLAND.
Al mi..! â¢ !Â».<â¢Â» >ot Tako Kindly to tlie
Proposition t â¢ lie Swallowed
Vp Bodily.
A LAMBDA, i.'al., April 22.â The calm
proposition of the Oakland politicians to
swallow up A arueda in toto and make of
it a mere component part of ''Greater
Oakland" touches no responsive cftord in
this city. Rather does it arouse the ire of
every one of the sixteen or seventeen
thousand people who reside in Alameda
and are prouJ of their little city.
There is not a single "argument" that
has been advanced in support of the move
ment that has any weight here. This city
is well governed, laxei are not high pro
portionately to the benefits received an><
the people are proud of Doing known as
residents of the model city. The an
nouncement of the Oaklanderi that only
politicians are opposed to the movement
is received here with amusement, since it
is well understood that it is really the
politicians who are desirous of wider
iieids of operations who are most demons
of the consolidation.
Alnrueda is not jealous of Oakland, does
not dislike it, but <lops not want it, either.
It iÂ» contort to move on in its own sphere
and preserve its autonomy. There is ab
solutely no tentiment here in favor of
consolidation.

ALAMEDA, Cal., April 22â Anson C.

in causing the arrest of a town-lot oper
ator named E. T. Casey, of Pasadena, who
is now under arrest on a charge of u<:ng
the United States mails ior fraudulent
].ilrp:>Â«e?.
Casey obtained title to forty acres of
mount aiii near Pasadena and platted it
"n pap?r as the Capitol Hill A dnion to
i'asaiena. He sent out most glowing
descriptions of its desirability and man
aged to dispose of quite a number of lots
at good price!". He got into communica
tion with Mr. Potter of this city and tried
to persuade him to become a purcba er.
But Potter was wary, and after receiving
several letters from Casey, telling about
the desirability of the lots, the street im
provements, the fine view, etc., he re
ferred the correspondence to the City
Clerk of Pasadena, who told him the
who> thinp had been misrepresented.
The United States authorities were then
called in, with the result that Casey waÂ«
arrested for criminal use of the mails.

PROHIBITION AS
A TOWN-KILLER
Chief Lloyd Says It Would
Make a Wilderness of
Oakland.
Declares That Unnatural Condi
tions of Society Are More
Harmful Than Drink.
Saloon-Clcsing Wiu'd On v Help to
Increase the L quor Tralfic cf
A'jiceni .Towns-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
* 908 Broadway, April 22. J
Chief of Police Liojd having been asked
by a prohibition paper published in the
East some pointed questions regarding
prohibition, he has forwarded some
answers that will no doubt cause much
comment in this city, where the question
was recently passed upon at the polls.
In reply to the question as to what share
of the police business arises from the use
of intoxicating liquors in this city, Chiei
Lloyd says that drink is far less respon
sible for crime and poverty than the un
natural conditions at present existing in
society. He says:
No accurate estimate could be made of the
proportion of po.lce business arising from the
use or abuse of intoxicating liquor, as in
many instances crime really originates from
over-indulgence in liquor when no actual
proof of thiii is at hand, and on the other band
liquor is ofteutlme< apparent as a cause of the
commission of crime when it really had
lu'iuing to do with it.
I speak now of what we class as misdemean
ors and minor crimes. Every year there are
more people arrested lor the crime of drunk
enness than for any ten other crimes, yet the
rolice force has leis trouble with the drunkard
thitn with tn . other criminal. In this city in
1896, out of 3000 arrest*, 1210 were plain
"drunk!"," mere were 170 battery cases, many
of which were due 10 liquor, mid 157 cases "I
disturbing i ho peace and 1(> cases of assault
with a deadly weapon. Â»l-o often attributed
to liquor.
Yet the department was kept in a constant
state of terror for nearly two months by fcenrJ
less youths who were engaged in safe-cracking
jobs almost nightly.
While I realize the great harm growing out
of over-indulgence In intoxicating l.quor 1 am
not prepared to admit that a great amount of
the important police business is due to that
evil, as the most huidencd, desperate and dan
gerous criminals we have are not addicted to
arunkenness, and nence 1 cannot tee that the
absence of the open saioon would materially
change the status of po.ice business.
In tact, 1 am of the opinion that the great
majority of dangerous criminals requiring
largo police forces ere the direct outgrowth oi
our unnatural social and economic conditions
that breeu poverty, want and despair in the
human heart. That men out of employment
and unable to secure the necessaries of life in
this land of plenty are the first cause of a
much larger percentage of criminality than is
the liquor v.l. That it is man's inhumanity
to man and our Government's partnership in
hat inhumanity r&tner than man's inebriety
that demands a large police force in every city.
This is me opinion of your humble servant,
and I have never been accused of being friendly
to rum.
Chief Lloyd has very pronounced
opinions of the effect of prohibition in
Oakland. He says: ' \ :
The effect In Oakland, if all the saloons were
to be closed, would be that our business would
be ruined, grass would, metaphorically speak
ing, grow in thn doorways of our business
houses, and neither drunkenness nor police
business would decrease, for the simple rea
son that. those who Witnted liquor would get it
in unbroken packages or would cross over to
San .Francisco, or go to Berkeley or Alameda,
our nearest neighbors, buy their liquor there
and come back to Oakland to raise . Pro
hibition in patches will never <lo anything but
harm to the particular patch worked upon.
If the reform could become general lucre
might ultimately be -ess demand lor large
numbers of policemen in all our cities, but it
would require time to change people's disposi
tions, or rather to work ihÂ« brimstone out of
their systems. Until economic conditions are
bettered. I am of the opinion that there will
be little im| rove men t in our criminal record,
no matter how much prohibition in patches
may be applied u> liquor. I repeat that warn
mid misery caused by unnatural conditions is
a greaier projenltor of crime than liquor, in
my opinion.

DEATH ENDED HIS PAIN.
Horrible Suicide of Edward
Ward well, a Sick Pen
sioner.
Shot Himself VWth a Revolver and
Cot His Throat With a Razir
After He Went to B?d.
When 12-year-old Edward Wardwell
opened the door of his father's room at
308 Shotwell street yesterday morning to
call him to breakfast he was horrified to
find his father dead in bed and covered
with blood.
The boy at once notified bis mother and
she ran out of the home screaming pite
ously. Deputy Coroner Tyrrell was sum
moned by telephone and removed the
mutilated body to the Morgue. It was
found that Wiirdwell baa first shot himself
with a revolver, then slashed his left
wrist ana forearm with a razor and then
cut bis throat.
The head was almost severed from the
body, and the tendons and arteries of the
left wrist were cut through. Wardwell
had tired one ballet into his body two
inches below trie heart out of a five-cham
bered bulldog revolver. The four iinex
ploded cartridges were dented, showing
that he had snapped the hammer and
pulled the trigger tive timea before the
weapon was discharged.
Wardwell was n native of Massachu
setts, 51 years old. an<l leaves a wife and
two children, the elder of whom is the
12-year old son Edwaid. He had been
suffering for a iong time with hernia and
locomotor ataxia and suffered very much
pftiii. Unable to work and depending
only upon a nension, he became daspond
ent and ended his life.
None of the family had any suspicion
that the deceased had intended to make
away with himself.

On Saturday evening, April 3, my stable,

me, he ruslie.i into the (Turning building, and
uitti almost Incredible strength carried me, a
man weighing nearly 200 pounds, through
smoke and fire to the door, where he feil un

May Gol reward him witn long life, lie is
an ornament to the department, and it your
honors should se? fit to bestow uj on him some

The letter was ordered to be placed on

next Scannell medal for his brave action.

OAKLAND
WANTS THE
NEW ROAD
The Citizens* Committee Is
Ready to Make Definite
Overtures.
EVERY EFFORT PUT
FORTH FOR VICTORY.
A New Ferry Contemplated and
Carshops and a Terminal
Are Urged.
PEOPLE ENCOURAGED OVER
THE PROSPECTS.
An Important Meeting Showing That
the People Are Awake and Will
Work With a Will.
OAKLAND, April is de
termined to have tbe Valley line if pos
sible. Citizens met Wednesday night and
a committee of fifteen got ready to make
(ieoid-d overtures. Ferries, carebops and
a terminal were urged for this City.
The conimiu-ie consisted of fifteen rep
resentative citizens, and it was marked
with great enthusiasm. Besides tse com
mittee several interested citizens were
prssent. The members of the committee
were: Mayor W. R. Thomas. J. P. Tav
lor, W. V. Wuciirr, .1. K. Talcott, F. K.
Mott, W. B. Pringle, \V. K. Davis, E. A.
Heron, (.ieorge t. Tardee, E. C. Sessiony,
J. A. liritton. .1. 1". Tewle. M. J. Keller,
Roben iiiriihe, J). \i. CoiJins and Webb Is.
Pearce.
Mayor Tiionvas called the meeting loor
dÂ«r, and a!< thi* was (he first general eath
ering the matter of choosing permanent
i tiicer* v as t't r>i taken up.
\V. K. Davis nominated the Mayor for
chair ua an and the motion unanimously
previul-il.
WeDb K. Pearce was elected secrelary,
mi 1 then vV. JR. Davis spoue, saying:
"I gathered from the reports that the
railroad people felt predisposed to make a
terminal here, coming in irom the north, j
They said considerable abuut the question
of rights of way, ami Migge^ted thai our
people maKe proportion to them.
though 1 do not know that any detinue
declaration was made."
"They answered the question direct,"
interposed Mayor Thomas, "and said that
they did want to come to Oakland, and j
would get in here if uiey could from the
north. Ttiev did not want to give us the
go-by, and it is certain they want to come
here if they can.' 1
â¢'When it was asted whether they
would consider coming in on the Califor
nia and Nevada line," continued the
Mayor, "they did not say it would be ac
ceptaoie, but that they intended to have
their ensrineer mnjee survey* along tlie '
route to see what could be done."
The discussion then took a general turn
and it was the prevailing idea that some
terminal should be found north of Sev
enth street, toward the western end of
the city.
E. A. Heron suggested that an executive
committee of rivÂ» be appointed by the
chair to ascertain what the railroad wants
and what rights of way can be reasonably I
assured.
M. J. Keller wanted reÂ«olutions passed I
to the f ffect t::at the committee believes
it is abie to secure a ri^ht of way into
Oakland, in order to get the matter prop
erly to the front.
Others thought differently, some being
of the idea that a number ot suitable ter- I
minals should be determined on first.
The Mayor believed the executive corn
nnttc* was a good iaea. It was put in tne
form of a motion and carried. The follow- j
ins were chosen: K. A. Heron, W. B.
Princie. M. J. Keller, fi. C. Sessions and
W. V. Witcher.
Mr. Keiier then offered the following:
"Resolve;!, That the committee shall
offer the best efforts to get the Valley road
into Oaklan i, the amount of the financial
aid to be determined by the location of
the terminal."
It was unanimously carried.
W. R. Davis mentioned the fact that
neither the committee nor the city could
brine condemnation suita in order to get
r'ghts of way, but the railroad could
do so.

-"- .rrs-it Â»- their sickness, we
will soon be a na-
tion most remarkable for health and longev-
ity. The plain, undecorated facts about Dr.
â¢Pierces Golden Medical Discovery are all
that is necessary to convince fair-minded
people of its transcendent merit. They
are as follows :
All diseases come from germs. The germs
get into the blood, propagate and increase
in the blood, which carries them all over the
body. When they find a weak spot, th,ey
stick to the weak spot. It becomes a dis-
eased spot, and the disease is called by the
name corresponding to its location in the
body. The cause is the same for nearly all
diseases. All impurities are germs, or breed
germs. Impure blood means germ filled
blood. Kill the germs, eliminate the im-
purities, enrich the blood, and it will force
itself into the diseased spot and strengthen
it, and give it power to throw off the germs
that Â«xist there. Dr. Pierce* Golden Med-
ical Discovery is designed to do thisâ
is the theory. The facts are these â tens of
thousands of people have used the "Dis-
covery." It used to be sold with the under-
standing that if it didn't cure, it should be
returned, and the money refunded. No-
body ever asked for the money, and so that
clause was dropped. Thousands of people
have written voluntary letters of thanks to
its discoverer. A few of these letters have
been included in Dr. Pierces great thou-
sand page book, Common Sense Medical
Adviser. It will be sent absolutely free on
receipt of 21 one-cent stamps to pay for
mailing only. Address, with stamps, World's

niittee could incorporate as a terminal
corporal. o:i, and thus be able to bring

It was finally decided, however, tiiat
the subject was somewhat premature at
present."
T c question was brought up as to
whether the railroad people expected Oak
land to lurni>h a complete risjbi of way
from here to Point Richmond. Some
thoueht this was the idea 1 , while others
believed a route from the charter line in
was the only matter involved. Itwasde
ciued to leave the question with the ex
ecutive committee.
The committee then adjourned to meet
again at the call of the chair, when reports
will be received from the sub-organiza
tion.

LOUIE QUONG TREED.
Sliftsing Witnesses in the Perjury Cast*
Could Not Be Found.
United States Attorney Foote appeared
before Judge Morrow yesterday morning
and stated that the United State? officers
had been unable to find the principal
witness against Louie Qnons, indicted for
perjury. He therefore moved that the i
case be dismissed. .Judge Morrow gram- i
ed the motion and ordered the prisoner
discharged.
Louie Quong was a Chinese interpreter
employed in the Custom-house with Dick
j\V [Hams, now under indictment. On the
; inai of Wong Sam in March, 169 G. charged :
I v. mi import into San Francisco :' Inwd
; woman named Dune Sun Yet, Quong
swore that he had not accompanied me
woman to a photographer in Chinatown
and had her,picture taken in imitation of
work done by a Hongkong photograph
gallery. Several Chinese witnesses swore
that Quong had taken the woman there,
and produced the photograph in evidence.
After Louie Quong's arrest the witnesses
disappeared and could not again be found. 1

CHASED AN D CAPTURED.
John Edwards, a Burglar, Dis- '
covered in a Rooming-
House.
When Arrested a Numb r of Stolen
Articles Were Found in Hi?
Poc Scots.
John Edwards, a "dope fiend," 30 years ;
of age. was booked at tho City Prison last â 
night by Policeman P. H. Murphy on a
charge of burglary.
Edwards by means of skeleton keys en- â 
t*>red the rooming-house of Miss Mallett, '
402O'Farrell street. He ransacked the i
room occupied by Mrs. Naunders and then
paid a visit to Mrs. Munro'a room.
David Vincent, one of the roomers, on j
reaching the bouse about 6:30 o'clock saw ;
Mrs. Munro's cioor open, an<l thinking it
strange he looked in. home one shut the
closet door from the inside. He thought !
it was Mrs. Munro's boy and walked up
to the closet. He tried to open the door, \
but the person inside held it tight till
Vincent succeeded in foicingit open a few
inches, when he saw enough to convince ,
him that a burglar was inside.
Vincent left the room, locking the door I
and taking the key with him. He went
to the grocery on the corner of O'Farrell ;
and Taylor and got a revolver. Thus i
armed he returned to the house and met
Edwards, who had used his skeleton keys j
with effect, comine downstairs.
E I wards dashed past Vincent, who j
started in pursuit, and J. !â >. Lean joined j
him. Policeman Murphy saw the chase, j
anil, running up Taylor street, he inter
cepted Edwards at Williams street and |
arrested him.
Edwards was taken to the rooming- j
house and Miss Mallett identified him as !
a young man she saw in the bouse. He!
was then taken to the City Prison, and on
being searched a souvenir silver spoon,
five silver nutpicks.lady's pold pin, a 1
pair of opera-glasse3 and several other
articles were found in his pockets, which
Mrs. Saundera identified later as her
property. A number o: skeleton keys
were also found in his pockets.
The rooming-hous* has been visited by
a burslar several times recently, and the
police believe Edwards has been the man.

Bg Competitive Drill To-Night in Aid
(f the Widows' and Orphans'
Home at Decoto
At 10 o'clock yesterday morning the
thirty -ninth annual conclave of the Grand
Comniandery of the Knights Templar
opened at the Masonic Temple aad will
continue for three days. There was a very
large attendance and much interest was
taken in the election of the various offi
cers for the ensuing 3*ear.
The first trrng, however, that com
manded the attention of the members
was the report of the secretary and various
committees- Immediately after these
were read an adjournment was taken till
2 o'clock In the afternoon. When the
members convened again it was to nomi
nate and elect the regular annual officers.
It took a pood while to gettbroueb with
the nominating and balloting, so long, in
fact, thai when the J.i3t names had been
voted for the day was ended and every
body was ready to go borne. The follow
ing is the full list of officers elected. They
represent the different parts of the State
pretty thoroughly:
Right Excellent Sir George V. Metcalf of
Oakland, grana commander; Very Ex
cellent Sir Robert M. Powers of San
Diego, deputy grand commander; Excel
lent Sir Joan I-. Merrill, of San Fraucisco,
grand generaiissimn; Excellent fcir Fred
erick M. Miller of Fresno, grand captain
general; Excellent Sip Charles E. Stone
of Marysville, grand prelate; Excellent
Sir George B. McKpb of &Â«n Francisco,
grand senior warden; Excellent Sir
William Frank Pierce of Oakland, grand !

*urer, ana Excellent Sir Thomas H. Cas- j
well of San Francisco, srand recorder.
This morning at 10 o'clock the members j
of the Grand Commandery will meet to |
take action in regard to the committees. â 
The six or eight appointive offices wiil
also be tilled ai an early period.
Interest now centers on the grand drill
exhibition, which is to take place this
evening at the Pavilion. It is to be a
competitive drill and the commanderies
here and at Oakiand, San Jose and pos
sibly Sacramento will be represented. It
is expected there will be much to see and
enjoy.
The object of the entertainment at the
Pavilion is highly worthy and creditable
to me member?. It is to furnish means |
to complete the Widows' and Orphans'
Home at Decoto, Alameda County, the
loundation of which was laid last fall.
The location of the home is beautiiul. It
has been thought that the home would
prove in every way a blessing to the
widows and orphans and tuerefore every
effort will be made to finish it in a neat
and comfortable manner.
It is expected there wiil be a laree at
tendance at the Pavilion. The competi
tive drill will probably well entertain all
who can crowd in to see it.
A NEW HALL.
Mission Lodge of Masons Will T.my the
Cornerstone Next Satur
day.
On Juno 28, 1863. a few enterprising
members of the Masonic order met at the
hall corner of Center (which is now Six
teenth) and Valencia streets and formu
lated a petition to the Most Worshipful
William C. Belcher, grand master of Ma
tons of California, fora dispensation au
thorizing them to organize a Masonic
lodge in the district. On September?,
1863, the desired dispensation was granted
and on September 15 Mission Lodge, with
thirteen members, began its work there
under. On the 13th day of October, 1864
a charter was duly granted to Mission
Lodce No. 109, F. and A. M. It has been
a prosperous lodge from the time of its
organization. It has grown In numbers
and wealth until now the statistics show
it to be one of the strongest lodges, both
numerically and financially, in the State.
From its original thirteen charter mem
bers it has increased to over 350 active
members at . the present time, and its
charities have been dispensed judiciously
and liberally. Feeling the need of larger
quarters the Mission Lodge Masonic Hall
Association was incorporated, both the
lodee. and members subscribing to the
stock, and a lot on the corner of Four
teenth and Guerrero streets purchased,
which tho association still owns. The lo
cation not being central enough the pres
ent lot on Mission street, between Twenty
second ana Twenty-third, was, purchased,
beinp 54 feet front by 125 feet in depth, on
which a substantial brick building is be
ing erected. There will be two stores on
the ground floor, with a large hall with
dome organ loft and secretary's office, and
one smaller hall and banquet-room.
, 'The main bailor lodgeroom will be the
largest of its kind in the State outside of
the Masonic Temple =in this City. The
new hall is situated in . the center of a dis
trict that is rapidly increasing in popula
tion, and is easily accessible from all parts
of the City.
The following are the officers of Mission
Lodge No. 169. P. and A. M. :
Andrew Christenson, W. M. ; William H.
Cobb. B. \V. ; Fred H. Gldsou, J. W. ; George V.

ART SPRING EXHIBITION.
Local Talent Presents Many
Original Drawings and
Faintings.
All the Popular Artis's Well Repre
sented and Mir.y New Names
in tli â  Line.
By special invitation last evening so
ciety and tte patrons of the Hopkins Art
Institute attended the opening of the
art spring exhibition, which lrom to-day
on will be thrown open to the general
pubiic
Three exhibitions of local art works
within the limited period of a year
must be urged as an excuse for the rather
meaner showing nu.de by California
artists. What the exhibition lacked in
numbers, however, was made up in gen
eral excellence. All the popular artists
were well represented, and many new
names were noticed in the line.
The exhibit was worthy a greater at
tendance than the specially invited saw
lit to honor it with. Not more than 100
representative art lovers loitered through
tne spacous rooms or toyed with the cat
alogues before some specially admired
picture.
There were no favorites. Each exhibitor
apparently had a following and no paint
ing however modest lacked its little knot
of kindly critic-.
Latimer showed several pictures. His
"Solitude," a restful study in brown and
ereen, wiih a high light shining throneb
ttie trees, was greatly admired. His
"Meadow," with its calm, cool atmosphere,
and the dainty bit, "'Sunset," founa many
admirers.
Mary Curtis Richardson's "Sketcn /or a
Portrait" was among the most pleasing of
figure studies.
Chris Jorgensen's "Coast, Near Santa
Cruz," was especially admired for its
rich coloring.
R. D. Yelland's "Autumn Twilight,
Long Island, New Yorfc," was a striking
study of light and shade done in the
anist"s best vein.
A delicious bit of ruality was A. P.
Niles' "Shady Road."
The lights and shadows in Clara E.
Curtis' "Summer" were cleverly man
aged.
Mary T. Menton's dainty little color
piece. "A Study in Violets," was greatly
admired.
(j. Cadenesso showed a pretty land
scape, "Spring," which was chiefly
noticeable loi its delicate coloring.
Like a zephyr from the country with its
breath of spring was "William Keith's
"From the Berkeley Hilisâ Springtime."
Keith's "Sunset" showed exquisite
coloring and a tenderness of poetic senti
ment rarely attained.
Other pictures which drew forth favor
able criticism were Jules Pages' "Musee
de Cluny, Paris," Alice B. Chittenden's
'â¢Chrysanthemums," Mary Curtis Rich
ardson's "Childhood," Charles Rollo
Peters' "Cyprus Tree, Moonli.'bt" and
his "Moonri'e," Elizabeth Curtis O'Sulli
van's "Portrait," Jules P.i^'es Jr.'s "Fish
Alley, Chinatown," and Kveyn McCoi
micli's "Sandhills. Monterey.".*

WILLING TO LIVE
WITH THE LEPERS
One Woman Who Would
Devote Her Whole
Life to Them.
Mrs. Sarah J. Hutchinson Makes
an Offer to the Board
of Health.
F-rels Called to lUka Their Lives
More Bsar. b'.iâ She Talks of
Her Plans
There is one woman in this City who is
i self-sacrificing enough to wish to deruie
| her life to the unfortunate being who are
! immured for life in that dismal, dilapida
i ted building celled the Pe3thouse. She
I asks for no pay, no emoluments, nothing
j but the permission to make their lives,
I while they last, more bearable by render
j ing their moldy prison more homelike.
This is the letter sac addressed to the
Board of Health on the subject yesterday:
San Francisco, April 22.
Mr. President, and Gentlemen of the Board of
Health: I nave a petition to bring before you
in regard to the lepers now confined in the
Festhouse; it may perhaps be more properly
called a request. I wish to ast j-ou to give me
the care of (hem, and of course put it in ruy
power to make them as comfortable as the
inmates of the hospital are nade. If I could
talk to you, 1 could make it more plain what I
mean than lean on paper, but what I want, Is
to have them as it were, given to me, the power
given me to make them as hat'py and con
tented as you would wish to have them made
if they were your own children. Their life is
a hard one at the best, alter nil has been done
that can be to alleviate their condition, and
the Lord nns Riven me a great loving pity for
them wherever found.
I teian about two years ago to try for the
privilege ol going to Molokai (H. I.) and have
since been to the Marquesas Islands in their
behalf, but my services are not need d there.
I did not know of the lepers at the I'esthouse
until my return from Hawaii, but they do
need some one to make them a home. 1 nave

Mrs Sarah J. IFitchinson.
Hotel Rainona, 130 i'llis street.
When seen at the Kamona last evening
i Mrs. Hutchinson said that she was actu
| ated to make her proposition to the boar!
j mainly because shÂ»* was concerned for the
i salvation of the suffering ones' souls. But
her feelings of humanity, she explained,
cut no small ligure with ncr desire to take
charge of the .epers.
"I want to be to them as a mother to
her children,' she added. "They should
be tHUght that for suffering and torture of
the flesh the only true remedy lies in the
peace that curnes through following in
ihe steps of the Lord.
"I am a member of the Holiness Church
of Los Angeles. So I believe in sanctirica
tion â that justification stops short oi the
highest religious sentiment."
Mrs. Hutchinson was ignorant of why
her mission to Hawaii failed. She stated
that s. c handed in her application to the
Board of Health at Honolulu to take
charge of tbe lepers at Molokai, and that
It was refused, with no reason assigned.
A second application received the same
treatment, and the new -papers simply
said, "Refused for the varue reason as at
first"
THE PUEE FOOD CONGRESS.
It Will Be Held in the Large Fioneer
Hall.
The Pure Food Congress, to be held on
April 30 and May 1, will without doubt be
a grand success. At the meeting of the
Manufacturers' Association and the com
mittees of the Pure Food Congress yester
day there was a very large attendance,
there being present: J. W. Kerr, W. F.
Bowers, M. J. Keller, S. McKee, I. Jacobs,
A. McLaughliu, Julian fcSonntag, J. P.
Currier, L. R. Mead, F. L. Brown, A.
S&arboro and B. N. Rowley.
The first matter considered was the
place of meeting. It was exnected that
the gathering would be held in the
Chamber of Commerce, but it was quickly
seen, after the invitations were s<snt out,
that the place wcuid not be nearly large
enouch to accommodate the delegates, a
lar^e number of whom are coming from
the interior cities. It was decided to hold
the congress in the Pioneer Hall on Fourth
i street, near Market. This hall will hold
about 450 people. I. Jacobs reported that
so far 411 delegates have promised to
attend the congress, and there are more to
hear from.
The special committee consisting of
Messrs. Rowley, Filcher, Mead, Jacobs
and Sonntag, appointed to prepare a i>ro
gramme and the order of business, made
its report, showing the manner of opening
the congress, appointing committees, etc.
The speakers und subjects will be ar
ranged Inter. It was decided toorgan:ze
the congress under the supervision of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion and a committee from the Council of
Associated Industries.
WANTED -A GROSSING.
Mission Residents Ask an Outlet From
Chenery Street to the Muslim Road.
The Street Committee of the rSoard of
Supervisors field a long discussion yester
day on the advisability of making a cross
ing of the railroad at Rrcmoke and Milton
streets for the purpose of giving residents
of the Mission district an outlet from
Chenery street to the Mission road.
Supervisor Clinton appeared on behalf
of the residents and asked that a grade
crossing be mÂ«de by ordering fences across
the ends of Iloanoke and Milton streets
removed. Thi-, he said, would give the
desired result at a small expense.
Chief Engineer Curtis vi the railroad
company said a grade crossing would be
dangerous and the proper way to settle
the matter wouM be to construct a bridge
to connect the two streets and by making
an under grade crossing at Castro street,
give the desired outlet.
Dr. Clinton objected to this on the
ground that it would cost several thousand
dollars to construct the bridge which the
City would have to pay, while the grade
crossing would cost very little. He
thought the railroad comnany desired to
save the expense of maintaining a gate
there.
The matter went over for two weeks.

CHILDREN COUNT WORDS
Thousands of Answers Sent In
to the Carnival Coa
test.
Three of the Lucky Winners An
nounced Last Night After a
Cartful Count.
The carnival word contest got up for the
children of the State has not lapsed wan
the carnival, nor will the successful young
sters have to go without tneir prizes just
because the fiesta has gone over for a year.
The lists are all in and have been
counted, and the first three prize-winners
have been announced.
The idea was to make as many woras as
possible from the words "Golden Gate
Carnival," the words to be jjood Enclish
words and to be found in the dictionary.
Fred Cost, southeast corner of Stockton
and Chestnut streets, won first pr;ze with
9296 words; Frank Mighell, 386 Twenty
fourth street, was second, with 8339 words,
ana Ethel Way, 923 Fell a. reel, came
third, with 828-1 words.
The answers were turned over to Miss
Lillie Follis of this City, and on her rested
the burden of countini and verifying.
They came in by thousands. Tiiere'were
lists iv blankbook?, on foolscap, on wrap
pinp paper, on scraps of old letters.
There were words never In the dictionary,
words misspelled and uncounted, some
lists not signed, others accompanied by
pathetic little notes. Tney almost filled
a room when pied together, and the task
of sorting them out was a herculean one.
The prizes will be $25, $15, $10 and ten
prizes of $1 each. These will be paid at
once from the remainder of the canival
funds, ThÂ« lists have been coming in for |
