The nestors of the Senate, Morrill of
* Vermont and Sherman of Ohio, headed
the procession and took tbe seats imme
diately in front of the Speaker and to his
right. The other Senators, the Repre
sentatives rising to their leet, found their

thereby much condensing the formal pro
ceedings.
Senator Lodge infused a temporary
streak of merriment into the proceedings
by inadvertently casting the vote of Mis
souri for "\V. J. McKinley" instead of
W. J. Bryan, but he promptly corrected
the error.
It fell to Mr. Grosvenor's lot to an
nounce the nine votes of South Carolina
for Bryan and SewalL As he did so an
expectant silence fell upon the assembly.
But not a whisper of protest was beard.
Mr. Grosvenor declared that the certifi

was accepted.

The Vice-Presidentâ Unless objection is
made the certificates of the remaining
States will not be read, but the result will
be announced by the tellers after they
have, satisfied themselves of the correct
ness of the returns.
The tellers then in rotation announced
the votes of the several Slates. The en
velope in each case was handed to the
tellers, opened and the certificate ex
amined. This required a minute or
more, the intervals being passed by the
members and visitors in conversation.
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 11, 1897.
There were no surprises in the announce
ments, the electors having voted as it was
expected they would when chosen last
| November.
Mr. Grosvenor's statement that Cali
j fornia had cast an electoral vote for
i Arthur J. Sewall of Maine lor Vice-Presi
' dent of the United States evoked several
questions as to the accuracy of the "J,"
but no formal action was taken.
It also fell to Mr. Grosvenor's lot to an
nounce the vote of Ohio, which he did
with a show of satisfaction manifest to all.
The call of States having been com
pleted, the Vice-President said the tellers
would announce the result of the vote.
This was done by Senator Lodge and de
livered to the Vice-President.*
The Vice-President said: "The result of

Richness of the . Decorations Amazes

NEW ' YORK. N. V., Feb. 10.â
Bradley Martin fancy dress ball took
place this evening in the spacious ball-'
room of the Waldorf Hotel. The mise en
scene was of bewildering enchantment, a
veritable fairyland, resplendent with all
that wealth and taste could command
and graced by the presence of many hun
dreds of members of the fashionable set,
radiant in rich robes of historic renown.
The richness of the decorations, the
ancient picturesque costumes, the beauti
ful allegorical toilettes, tbe commingling
of so many beauties, old and young,
amazed and charmed all fortunate enough
to have been bidden to the ball.
As a superb social function it had had
no parallel in America. Its fame may pass
into history and perhaps its splendors
will be written down as .'the standard' for
belles and gallants of the coming century.
The scene presented was a strange specta
cle in the up-to-date metropolis. '
At the first coup d'oeil one would have
imagined tbe graves had opened and the
kings and queens, the princesses and the
titled aristocracy of the decayed centuries
bad arisen in chorus to again become
themselves in all their old-time glory.
Perhaps there were 700 guests present, all
gorgeously garbed in silks and satins, be
decked in diamonds.
Almost every character of note in the
times of Louis XIV and XV, from the
plebeian peasant to the jewel-crowned
king and queen, were personated. > They
presented imposing figured, dancing the
stately minuet or whirling in the merry
waltz. Numerous we:e the psendo Marie
Antoinettes, Queen Elizabeths, Lady Tea*
zles, Gismondas, Juliettes, Joan d'Arcs,
Empress Josephines, Mary Queen of
Scots, colonial dames, Knights of Malta,
cardinals, Romeos, toreadors and cava
liers, all in costumes of the costliest fab
rics and with marvelous trutb to detail.
The Marie Antoinette ladies predomi
nated.
America's historic notabtes seemed
sadly neglected, even the Father of His
Country, George. Washington, being hon
ored by only two representatives.
Aside from the beauty of costumes in
terest centered on the unprecedented dis
play of jewels, many rare, old, priceless
family heirlooms' being worn. There is
no estimating tbeir monetary worth, but
they certainly represented vast . fortunes.
Many of the women' seemed; ablaze with
their sparkling gems. * ' 'â 
The guest- began â  arriving about 11
o'clock. They entered the hotel through
a private door on Thirty-third street and
were immediately ushered to the second
floor, where a suite of fine large apart
ments had been reserved for dressing
purposes. Here were stationed numerous
hairdressers, costumers, modistes and all
functionaries required for the final polish
ing touches oi the exquisite outfits.
These rooms were decorated with a pro
fusion of roses and smilax.
After the guests bad assembled and
made ready for tbe grand entree, they de
scended, the flower-strewn stairways to
%ha, reception parlor on toe main floor.
.As they passed through the archway they
were met by * the hostess, Mrs. Bradley
Martin, who stood beneath a canopy of
rich tapestries and floral effects. Mrs.
Martin wore a becoming costume ot the
Queen Elizabeth period, made of black
velvet over red brocade. She was adorned
with all her magnificent jewels, including
her famous rope of diamonds.
As the guests approached their names
and the characters they impersonated
were announced by lackeys. The walls of
the reception room were covered with
costly tapestries of the daintiest colors,
while myriads of roses carelessly strewn
decked the folds as they chanced to fall.
In one corner was placed the Hungarian
band, hidden behind a bower of long
stemed roses.
The guests moved from this saloon
through the corridors, which had been
made to represent a woodland, lighted by
scores of miniature incandescent lights, to
the big ballroom. The decoration of this
room was also a work of art and the illu
mination brilliant. At the end of the
room was a balcony, handsomely adorned,
in which was stationed Victor Herbert's
orchestra for the dance music
It was near midnight before the Quadrille
de Honneur, the opening number of the
ball, was danced. It had been ordered by
Mrs. Astor. John Jacob Astor was the
King of the night and Mrs. Bradley-
Martin the Queen. They led the quadrille,
and at one side were Mrs. Stuyvesant
Fish and Robert Van Cortland; at the
opposite end Miss Gerry and J. Townsend
Martin and Mrs. Whitney Warren and
Li-penard Stewart. The opposite side
couples were: ' MrÂ». Orrae Wilson and
Harry Lehr, Mrs. Lee Tailer and Craig
Wadsworth, Miss Lena Morton and Cen
ter Hitchcock and Miss Madeline Cutting
and J. J. Van Alen.
Following these came the Mrs. Edmund
Bayles quadrille, which was participated
in by Mrs. Ogden â¢ Mills, Mrs. John Jacob
Astor, Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr., Mrs.
Henry Sloan, Miss Edith Morton, Miss
Van Rfenssalaer, Miss Alfonso de Navarre,
H. D. Robbins, Worthington Whitehouse
and others.
' Then came tbe debutante quadrille, all
the dancers wearing costumes of the Louis
Quinse. period. Quadrilles were danced
to the slow music of the minuet, and the
different figures were executed with grace
and precision.
General dancing was then indulged in.
Supper was served in the Empire dining
rooms. The table were prettily decorated
with roses. The cotillon after supper was
led by Elisha Dyer Jr., who wore a cos
tume of tbe oeriod of Francis I. It con
sisted of a cloak of royal purple, a coat of
the same material richly decorated with
gold embroidery. The tights were of vio
let silk aud be wore a hat with large
ostrich feathers.

The movement in this City to assist
the struggling Cubans in their fight for
liberty and independence has taken a

Mr. Maseherini was deep in a letter to
Colonel Ethan Allen, who has charge of
the New York headquarters, last evening
when called upon.
" There is no question of our succeed

Dear Sir:
Being an old pioneer, and loving the great
and noble State of California, and proud of our
Mayor, yourself and other sympathizers with
the suffering and down-trodden Cubans, in
their fight for freedom, I feel that the least
I. can do is to enroll myself as one who is will- 1
ing to be known as strongly in favor of the
extension of human liberty, and the greatest
possible. enlargement of personal freedom. I
wish to unite in my feeble way, with you and
other pioneers, in this grand and patriotic
movement, in the supreme effort to so influ
ence our Congress, and the incoming adminis
tration, as to cause them to legislate in the
interest of the suffering patriots of Cuba,
as to at least, and as soon as possible, to
recognize them as belligerents, and place
the American Nation on record sas favoring
human freedom everywhere in the land.
I feel deeply interested, and only wish I
could take a more active part.
I remain yours in sympathy,

"I received to-day a visit from a most
j remarkable man. His name is T. B.

i In 1848 he joined the movement that was
started in the Southern States in favor of

portion of the expedition reached the coast
ahead of the others and embarked, leaving
the detachment behind.
"Those who succeeded in reaching
Cuba were captured by the Spanish war

FREEDOM OR NOTHING.
Cubans JLaugh at Spain's Overtures in
the Way of " Kef- rnts."
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 10.â A dis
. patch to tbe Sun from Havana says: Gen
eral Weyler has denied that he intends to
communicate with Gomez or has author
ized Senor Garcia or any other person to
make proposals of peace to the Cubans in
arms. He says that in the preamble to
tbe reforms all tbat Spain tan say to the
insurgents she has said. Spain has spoken,
and now tbe insurgents should surrender
and give Spain an opportunity to establish
the new regime.
The decree of reforms is not, says Gen
eral Weyier, a proposal to the revolution
ists. It is only tbe announcement of
what Spain is willing to do after her "re
bellious sons" lay down tteir arms. The
above declarations were mode Monday by
General Weyler at Santa Clara.
The Spanish press here is full of praises
of the magnanimity of tbe mother coun
try in granting tne reforms; but what is
written and printed is one thing and what
is really thought is another. The Span
iards themselves regard the reforms as a
last resort of the Government.
Yesterday, as during all last week, rain
has been falling heavily in Havana. The
dreaded season when the Spaniards will
be compelled to quit the field and go into
camp is approaching. They all contem
plate with terror this time so near at hand,
and if their newspapers do not whisper it
their talk with one another shows they
consider their cause to be lost.
With thissentimentof despairis mingled
a fierce desire for revenge, of which the
following paragraph from El Pueblo, a
very popular newspaper among the com
mon Spaniards of Havana, gives an idea:
"We will not abandon Cuoa, even if the
Government should do it. As our great
poet, Camprodon, said during the last
Cuban rebellion, before returning to the
mother country, we will leave behind us
in once opulent Cuba only a heap of rub
bish. Our revenge will be as great as the
infamous gratitude of the Cubans. Noth
ing will remain here. The place where
Havana stood will be unrecognizable to
the future traveler. If we have to fail we
will prove to the world what the energies
of our race really are."
All signs indicate that a condition of
anarchy like that in Havana from 1869 to
1871 is approaching.
General Gomez' tactics are to wait for
the rainy season, without attempting to
meet Weyler in a big battle.
The Cuban army, with the scanty re
sources which it receives from the United
States, has not all the equipment required
to drive from the island 200.000 regular
Spanish soldiers well provided with
munitions. But the Spaniards have not
the power to crush the revolution, which
grows stronger every day.
The result is that if Cuba can obtain
recognition as a belligerent from any
American nation, and thus secure a reli
able source from which to procure guns
and cartridges, the patriots will win in a
few months. If not, the war will last for
years, and in the long run Spain, which
has to pay $8,000,000 a month for war ex
penses, will be tbe loser. This is recog
nized here to be the real situation.
SANGUILLI'S RELEASE PROMISED
But He Must Leave the Island Until the
War 1* Ended.
. NEW YORK, N. V.. Feb. 10.â A special
to the Herald from Washington says:
Spain has promised to release Julio San
guilly, sentenced in Cuba to life impris
onment for alleged conspiracy against its
Government. Secretary Olney has re
ceived from Madrid an answer to the rep
resentations be made through Minister
Taylor several weeks ago to the effect
which is given above.
When Spain will put her promise into
execution cannot be learned, â  but the
authorities hope that the date is not far
distant. O.ney's representations were
made in view of all of the circumstances
ln the case, and especially of the long im
prisonment already suffered bySanguiliy.
Under the conditions of his pardon San
guilly will be required to leave the island
and not return until the present war has
ended.

NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 10.â At the
conclusion of the final scene of the opera
"Martha" at the Metropolitan Opera-house
to-night Armand Castlemary, the well
known singer, reeled and before assistance
could be procured be fell dead. Heart
disease was the cause.
Tne opera-house was crowded to hear
the production of Fiotow's famous opera.
All had gone well during the first act, and
Castlemary, who had the part of Tristan,
by his superb acting and wonderful sing
ing had drawn round after round of ap
plause.
At the conclusion of tbe act tbe scene
represents him as surrounded by a crowd
of merry villagers. Nearly half a hun
dred chorus-girls who took part in the pro
duction were dancing in a circle about the
old man. Suddenly Castlemary reeled,
tripped and fell.
By a superhuman effort he recovered
his feet and rushed in among the crowd
which surrounded him. He grasped a
table and supported himself until the cur
tain dropped. As the curtain went down
Castlemary gave way and fell to the stage.
The first to reach the dying man was
Jean de Reszke, who was standing in the
window. Castlemary witbout utterin.- a

EXPLOSION ON A BATTLE-SHIP.

CHARLESTON, S. C, Feb. 10.â A seri
ous accident occurred on Doard the battle
ship Maine yesterday, but it was kept
quiet until to-day. This was rendered
possible by the fact that the squadron lies
some sixteen miles from the city out at
sea.
While a crew, consisting of First Ser
geant Waener and Privates Senman and
Hardin were loading a one-pound gun of
the Maine's secondary battery with a one
pound caliber cartridge the cartridge ex

on the right hand, tearing the flesh from
tbe bones. Part of the shell struck Har
din in the leg and it has not yet been ex

than seriously hurt. Senman was hurt
about tbe face.
The Indiana and Massachusetts bave
not joined the fleet. It was learned to
day that the maneuvers are to begin at
once, and the Dolphin, which it was
thought yesterday had gone south, is
probably to act as a blockade- runner.

GAGE A SINGLE-TAKER.
Secretary Suddell Says McX n ley's Secre-
iary of the Treasury Contributed to
the Delaware Campaign.
WILMINGTON, Del., Feb. Lyman
J. Gage is a single-taxer.
This is the amazing revelation made
here in connection with President McKin
ley's appointment of the veteran Chicago
banker to the treasury portfolio. The
announcement was made to-night by
Harold Suddell, secretary and treasurer of
the single-tax campaign committee of
Delaware.
In an interview Mr. Suddell said: "I
do not think that Mr. Gaee cares to con
ceal to any degree the fact that be is a
single-taxer. He contributed very liber
ally to our campaign here last year. I
wish we only had a few more like him to
help our good cause along. .Mr. Gage is
one of the most ardent single- tuxers of
the West, and we Â«re proud to have him
in oar army."
Asked the extent of Mr. Gage's contri
bution, Mr. Suddell said be did not care
to name the amoant, but admitted that it
was over $5000. Mr. Suddell also said that
Osgood Brown, Mr. Gage's attorney, also
contributed to the fund, and tbat tne sub
scriptions were secured by J. A. Wolf, a
prominent single-taxer of New York, last
spring.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC MUST PAY.
No Quarter in Back Taxes or Forfeits Is
the Result of the Kentucky
Conference.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 10.â Judge Al
exander Humphrey of Louisville, attorney
for the Southern Pac fie Railroad, arrived
here to-day and held a long conference
with Attorney-General Taylor, with a view
to compromising the suit for State taxes
that has been prepared by General Taylor
against the Southern Pacific
General Taylor gave him^o understand
that no compromise would be entertained,
but that the road would be required to pay
the franchise tax and $1000 fine for every
year since 1892, and $50 each day during
the whole time in addition; that he pro
posed to recommend repeal of charter to
Governor Bradley, who would so recom
mend it in his extra session call, on
grounds that the road failed to comply
with law, and that no quarter would be
given.
Judge Humphrey said the road was dis
posed to comply with tbe law and prevent
the suit, but he spent the entire day look
ing up the charter and preparing to resist
legal proceedings. He doubts that the
State can recover both franchise and other
taxes, and will make this statement to
General Taylor. Action will then betaken.
THE SHE EI Mt.IAL WORKERS.
Association Votes to Indorse the National
Building 'trades Council.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Feb. 10.â The In
ternational Sheet Metal Workers' Asso
ciation this afternoon by unanimous vote
indorsed the proposed National Building
Trades Council, thus renouncing allegi
ance tothe American Federation of Labor.
This placing of 40,000 tinners and other
sheet metal workers to' the new project
seemingly assures its success, as the build
ing trades unions of most of the leading
cities of the country.it is claimed, have
already formally favored it. i' *--
An amendment to the constitution was
adopted increasing ____ initiation fee from
$5 to $15. Another proposed amendment,
which is likely to carry, is the doing away
of a number of conventions, and holding
instead called, or biennial, ones.

THE FIRST DAY
FOR GOOD ROADS
Annual Assembly of the
League of American
Wheelmen.
Electioneering for 0 ficers Divid
ing the Time With
Highways.
Prominent Wheelmen From AH Sec
tions at Albanyâ Speeches of
the Opening Session.
ALBANY, N. V., Feb. 10.â Wheelmen
of the highest prominence from all sec
tions of the country were 'present to-day
at the opening session of the annual as
sembly of the National League of Amer
ican Wheelmen: The opening gun was
fired in the cause of good roads, to-day
being devoted to the consideration of this
important question as regards the highest
interest of wheelmen.
The assembly opened in Jermain Hall
under auspicious circumstances, having a
larger attendance of delegates and leaders
from every State than at any previous
one. Every State in the Union is repre
sented with the exception of Florida and
Louisiana. _
The fight for the different offices goes
merrily on, and has tended to coun
teract on the good roads discussion, many
of the delegates being absent, so that they
could do something to build the fences of
their candidates stronger.
At 10:20 o'clock about 300 persons had
arrived and President Elliott rapped for
order. He said that all appreciated the
work that could be done on this occasion,
and that tbe L. A. W. had taken an im
portant step in setting asido a day for
good roads discussion. He asserted
that the side path was a good thing,
but was not certain whether the wheel
men were justified in building tbem, as it
seemed that such work retarded the good
roads movement. At the conclusion of
his remarks he introduced Chief Consul
I. B. Potter of New York as chairman of
the day.
Mr. Potter received an ovation when he
assumed charge of the meeting. He said
he would take up the side-path question
where Mr. Elliott baa left it. and intro
duced Lieutenant-Governor Woodruff as
having been instrumental in choosing the
celebratea path from Brooklyn to Coney
Island. The Lieutenant-Governor was re
ceived very heartily and made a brief
speech.
J. Cohen of Portland, Or., was next in
troduced and talked on the roads question
on the Pacific Coast and -specially in Ore
gon and California. He said that tbe
roads in Oregon left unimproved were
simply bottomless, and it took a good
deal of money to start the work of im
provement.
Since the Oregon Road Cinb, which con
tained 711 members, had been instrumen
tal in getting improvements in the city of
Portland, asphalt has been used, but it
has not answered the purpose, and they
were now experimenting with wooden
blocks.
James Owen of. Newark, N. J., who was
instrumental in securing tbe good roads
for New Jersey, followed with an address
on the roads in that State. He said, the
first important tank in good roads move
ments is to educate the people up to tbat
point.
W. E. McClintock, a member of the
Massachusetts Highway Commission, was
the next speaker. At 11 o'ciock a recess
was taken until 3 o'clock.
When the assembly reconvened the
hall was filled. Hon. A. B. Choate of
Minneapolis, a prominent advocate of
good roads, was the first speaker. He
said th* laws on the subject of highways
in the United States at present are a jum
bled mass of incongruities, without sys
tem or ingenuity and resembled a crazy
quilt.
He thought that the law which was in
force in the majority of the States allow
ing the farmers to work ont their road tax
on the roads was responsible for the bad
roads in the United States. He thought
this rule should be abolished by every
State, and urged the L A. W. to exercise
its offices in this direction as a primary
step to a general rood roads movement.
He said that there were two principal
ways in whicb the L. A. W. can work for
belter roads laws. One is by entering into
practical politics and the other is by act
ing as missionaries for the gospel of good
roads. He said the present prospects are
good for advancement in road improve
ment everywhere, and in conclusion he
urged all to expend some of their energies
in this movement, that there might bea
united effort."
J. W. Morrison, civil engineer, of Rich
mond County, gave a history of the good
roads movements in Staten Island.
E. C. Harrison of the Government Bu
reau of Good Roads gave an account of
bis experience while traveling through
New York and Pennsylvania in the inter
est of highway improvement.
While the good roads convention was in
session there was a great deal of excite
ment about tbe headquarters of the two
candidates for president.
E. W. Connelly of Illinois still persists
in having his name sent to the convention
as a candidate for president. The West is
divided on tbis question, and unless there
is a change before 10 o'clock next Monday
it is said that all the votes Connelly will
have will be those of his own State.

Senator Morgan this morning rose in
bis seat and denounced these insinuations
in vigorous language, saying that as long
as a party continued to "play boss" in
electing a Senator he would vote as be

lowed he again voted for Pickler.
The vote to-day stood : Pickler 49, Ryle
24,,Goodykoontz 19, Plowman 10, Hinck

The Democrats left Ryle and voted

TELEPHONE PtTE.ST DECISION.
Western Construction Company's Victory
in a Chicago Court. SSH
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 10.â Judge Show
alter of the United States Circuit Court
handed down an important decision to
day in favor of the defendants in the suit
of the Western Electric Company, repre
senting the Bell Telephone Company,
against the Western Telephone Construc
tion Company, for an alleged infringe
ment on the Watson telephone switch.
Judge Showalter held that the Watson
switch was anticipated by the previous
condition of the telephone art in the prior
Watson and Roosevelt patents. The main
issue was the attempt to secure damages,
as the more important parts of the patent
had expired by limitation,, and the suit
** as directed against the alleged infringe
ment prior to the expiration of the patents.
Another suit is -proceeding before the
. same court between tbe same parties, in
volving infringement of the Roosevelt
patents. .IMwndM 'â "pjff___BflÂ«

CANTON, Ohio, Feb. 10.â Much inter
est was found to-day in the visit of P. C.
Knox of Pittsburg. He has been dis
cussed as a Cabinet possibility. Major
McX nley sent his carriage to the station
to meet him and welcomed him heartily.
Mr. Knox took lunch with the President

/VAILS AND CUTLERY.
Tariff Subjects Considered by Republican
Members of the Ways and Means
Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 10.â The
Republican members of the Ways and
Means Committee at their session this
morning considered that part of the iron
and steel schedule relating to nails. It
was decided that this product was manu
factured so cheaply in America that it
needs little if any protection. The manu
facturers themselves virtually acknowl
edged this in their arguments before the
committee, and it was agreed therefore
that a tentative rate, equaling about one
fourth of the rate fixed in the McKinley
law, should be adopted; in other words,
certain classes of nails upon which the
duty was 2 cents a pound in the law of
1890 have been scaled down to half a cent
a pound, and this relative reduction is
carried through the entire list.
Some of the Republicans went so far as
to express their belief that even this low
rate was prohibitory and that the duty
might be wholly abolished. It was con
tended, however, that some of the nail
manufacturers, particularly on the Pa
cific Slope, needed a small measure of pro
tection, owing to the low freight rates
which enable the foreign product to be
laid down in this country at practically
tbe price for which it was sold abroad,
and it was for this reason principally that
a duty was retained.
Cutlery also received some attention
from the committee, witbout a more defi
nite conclusion being reached than that it
should be reclassified and the duty made
specific, and very materially increased
above the existing rate.

To Prevent Smuggling.
ST. JOHNS, Newfoundland, Feb. 10.â
Governor Murray left for England to-day.
One of the chief objects of his visit is to
urge upon the imperial cabinet the abso
lute necessity of a British Consul being
stationed at the French colony of St.
Pierre to prevent the smuggling now go
ing on between St, Pierre and. the New
foundland maritime provinces and tbe
New England coast. The Newfound
land and Canadian governments unite in
urging the necessity of this appointment.
Popular agitation for the revival of the
bait act is increasing, and the Govern
ment is likely to appoint a commission to
consider the whole question of the French
fishery when tbe Legislature meets.

ance of the bonded warehouses in Cali

try and he was sorry that he could make
no exceptions on account of inconveni
ences in the different localities. Those
who have good-* in bond in San Francisco
warehouses and elsewhere will have to use

America is a nation of dyspeptics. It begins
-with indigestion from a lack of assimilation \
of food, and results in impoverished blood, j.
devitalized nerve forces, neurasthenia, all the â 
various forms of catarrhal conditions, acid '
dyspepsia, ulceration of the stomach, render-
ing tbe system weak and debilitated, so that it
cannot withstand the ravages of any disease,
either acute or chronic, thus producing con-
sumption, liver complaint, constipation, kid-
ney and bladder troubles.

The first step is to build up the digestive or-
gans and restore tnem to their natural condi-
tion. This cannot be done by animal and
vegetable pepsins. The secretory glands of
the stomacn and intestines must be made to
do their work. Artificial digestions and pre-
digested foods are of only temporary value,
because the dieestive organs under their use
become torpid. The Electro - Medical treat-
ment, administered only at the State Electro-
Medical Inst tute, acts as a stimulant to the
digestive organs and caus.s them to throw off
Nature's own digestives, which soon remove
all evidences of lack of nutrition. A treat-
ment must be given which will cause proper
assimilation of food to produce a pure blood
supply.

ATHENS, Greece. Feb. 10.â The tor

sailed for Crete.
Before the fleet departed Prince George
was given a grand ovation.
â¢ The Prince declared that he would pre

created intense excitement here, from de

SENATE PROCEEDINGS.
Morgan Withdraws the Nicaragua Canal
Bill for the Session.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 10.âBe
fore the Senate left its chamber to-day to
participate with the House of Representa
tives in the solemn formality of counting
the electoral votes for President and Vice-
President of the United States the only
matter which c_tme up for consideration
was Tillman's (D. of Sonth Dakota) bill
"amplifying and classifying" the ex
change law as to the right of State author
ities to seize intoxicating liquors brought
into the State.
It was strenuously opposed by Senators
Sewall (R.) of New Jersey, Mdls (D.) of
Texas and Vest (D.) of Missouri on the
ground that it was an interference with
interstate commerce, a violation of the
right of personal freedom and an attempt
to give the monopoly of the liquor traffic
of South Carolina to the home distillers.
Tbe dii-cussion had not been closed when
the time came for the Senate to proceed
.to the House, and the bill went over with
out action.
After the Senate returned to its cham
oer the Nicaraguan canal bill came up as
tbe unfinished business, and Morgan (D.)
.of Alabama, recognizing the impossibility
of its passage this session, withdrew it,
giving notice, however, that he would in
troduce it at the extra session, and would
)>re.-s it to a vote. He made a long speech
upon it, in which he imputed the obstacles
â  wbicb liie canal project bad met to British
intervention.
After the Nicaraguan bill had thus been
taken oat of tbe way the bankruptcy bill
came to the front as "the unfinished busi
ness." It, however, went over until to
morrow.
The agricultural appropriation bill was
then taken up and alter some discussion
was passed.
At 5:30 the Senate adjourned.
SENSATION AT SALEM.
Veteran Senator Carter Denounces the
Men Who Are Working for
Mitchell's Re-Election.
SALEM, Ok., Feb. 10.â The joint as
sembly was called to order at 12 o'clock
sharp by Senator Brownell. The rolicall
showed ten Senators and twenty-eight
Representatives present, a total of thirty
eight.
Another big sensation came to-day.
Senator Carter, who had been ill for some
days, arrived and both parties claimed
him. The Mitcbellites confidently as
serted that the Senator would be re
elected to-day, and leading citizens
thronged tbe buildine in expectation of
the event. The city had been full of
- Mitchell strikers, and a dead-set was
made upon Carter. After the rolicall the
old man arose and told of the eff i>rts that
were made to secure his vote. Mitchell
pave him a positive promise that forty
five men would be present if he would
make the lortv-sixth, and the battle
would be won. He promised, he came for
that purpose, and was ready to make the
forty-sixth; but he had been deceived
and lied to. He charged Mitchell and his
men with falsehood, and then left. A
round of applause greeted the old veteran,
as he lett the room.
The two Democrats again failed to
answer their names. The joint convention
then adjourned until to-morrow at noon.

half as much as last year's shipments for
the entire season, when but 2000 carloads
were shipped. Orders for fruit are coming
in fast, and since the cessation of rain the
packing-houses are scenes of great activ
ity. Continued clear weather is very much
desired here now, in order that orders may

IRE STEEL RAIL
POOL'S RUPTURE
Big Contracts Came Along
and Tempted Manu
facturers.
Their Secret Acceptance Was
the Signal for Hostilities
to Begin.
Present Prices May Moke Trouble
Over Outstanding Contracts at
Higher Figures.
NEW YORR, N. V., Feb. 10.â Even
ing Post of this afternoon prints the fol
lowing: "An interesting account of the
direct causes which precipitated the rup
ture in the steel rail pool which was an
nounced at Pittsburg yesterday was given
to-day by a person familiar with the situa
tion. Representatives of two of the larg
est mills met at Chicago on Monday to
agree upon rates governing business in a
particular section of the country and de
cided upon $20 as a basing price for certain
prices. Just at that time some large con
tracts came into the market, and one of
the concerns interested was offered profit
able business at a lower figure. Rumors
of cutting in various directions were cur
rent at the time, so the tempting offer was
accepted and an order aggregating many
thousand tons was taken at a price said to
be in the neighborhood of $17 a ton. Tbis
necessitated, of course , the withdrawal of
one concern from the pool and hostilities
were begun as soon as the transaction be
came generally known.
Orders were taken in this city yesterday
at a basic price of $20 for the rails at the
mill, and local agents of some of the
largest concerns are said to be anxious to
do as mucn business as possible while an
open market prevails.
It is not possible at this time to tell just
what effect prevailing prices will have
upon outstanding contracts. Within the
last few weeks contracts amounting to
more than $1 000,000 have been made by
some of the railways at prices averaging
$23 or $27 a ton, and although some of
tbem are binding at these figures it is
thought likely that many orders will be
delivered at a lower rate by mills anxious
to hold tbe patronage of good customers.
Whatever settlement is reached, however,
losses are inevitable. The present situa
tion, it is thought, will not disturb imme
diately the market for streetcar rails, and
the large contracts recently given by local
companies are not likely to be affected.
PLACING LARGE CONTRACTS.
Raxlroads Take Advantage of the Re-
duction in Price*.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 10.â The develop
ments to-day in railroad and steel rail
making circles indicate that the first big
cut in the price of rails was made secretly
some time ago by the Illinois Steel Com
pany; tbat contracts were made for sev
eral million dollars* worth of rails by the
Illinois concern with various railroads,
and it was the knowledge of these con
tracts around $21 a ton in Chicago, when
the Pittsburg price was $25, wbicb resulted
in the hasty dissolution of the Rail makers'
Association, of which the Illinois com
pany has never been a membar. The
price of steel rails in Chicago yesterday
made by the Illinois corporation was $21 a
ton. To-day the price was cut to $18 to
meet the competition of the Carnegie-
Rockefeller combination especially and
the new price made by other railmakers
who were members of the disrupted asso
ciation.
The report that $5,000,000 of contracts
under $21 a ton have been made recently
with much secrecy by the Illinois Steel
Company with halt a dozen railroads is
substantially corroborated by the fact that
big orders have been placed by the Illi
nois Central, Lake Shore and Santa Fe
railroads among others.
The Illinois Central contracts lead, so
far as known, and it to-day announced
that it bad taken advantage of the recent
break in prices and bad placed orders
with different firms for 50,000 tons for de
livery in 1897. Of these orders 45,000 tons
went to the Illinois Steel Company.
Second Vice-President Harahan of the
Illinois Central, in commenting to-night
on this big order, said: "If the other rail
roads would only come forward with pro
portionately large orders the wheels of
commerce would be set in motion all over
tbe land."
The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
placed a large order with the Illinois Com
pany, the bulk of the material, it is under
stood, being for use in improving the road
bed of the Atlantic and Pacific branch of
the system. The Lake Shore and Michi
gan Southern roaa gave an order to the
Illinois Company for 5000 tons at $21.
In an interview to-day with President
Gales of the Illinois Steel Company, held
after the annual meeting of the corpora
tion's stockholders, he said: "The Illinois
Steel Company's price for steel rails to
day is $18 in Cbicago. We have made
sales since the dissolution of the rail
makers' association. We are getting
orders to-day at the reduced price. Jeal
ousies and distrust broke up the steel
rail pool."
â¢â¢What do you expect will be the effect
of the Carnegie- Rockefeller combination
against your company ?"
"I rather think we will be making steel
rails for some time to come. We will stay
in this fight as long as tbey do. We were
not members of the Rail-makers' Asso
ciation and always refused to join the
pool. Piices of steel rails will take a big
drop during this year. The reduction will
probably represent a loss of $15,000,000.
It will certainly be $10,000,000, and may
be $15,000,000. Tbe starting of this cut
price move is a piece of vandalism on the
part of certain competitors. It was the
work of agents who were intrusted with
millions' worth of property without the
knowledge of the owners of this vast prop
erty."
"Will there be any change in the man
agement or policy of the Illinois Steel
Company during the year?"
'â¢There will be none that I know of.
There will be considerable trimming of
expenses to meet the decreased revenue
from the low price of rails, but our general
policy of retrenchment on account of
trade depression has been in operation for
some time. .''/Â« \
"In the matter of reducing wages as a
means of offsetting reduced revenue it is
announced that the Metropolitan Iron
and Land Company, of which tbe Illinois
Steel Company is the chief stockholder,
to-day cut the wages of all employes 10
per cent at their mines in the Geogebic
range. The reports to the trade and rail
road agents to-day from Pittsburg were
tbat the Eastern mills had cut the price to
$17 in Pittsburg." - v'

ONE POOL WILL COLLAPSE. 'M
A Big War in Prices Among Northern

CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 11.â The Tribune
this morning says: The Iron Ore As
sociation, which has controlled prices
and fixed the output of the
Lake Superior mines, stands directly in'
the path of the cyclone, which has swept
away every combination and pool in the
iron and steel trade for the development
of business and the maintenance of
prices.
What the Rockefeller-Carnegie combina
tion will do in the ore pool will become
manifest within a fortnight. The first an
nouncement will be in the shape of large
sales of ore for delivery during the com
ing season of navigation without regard
to the pool.
Even more important than the collap.e
of the steel-rail pool, which was scattered
to the winds on Monday, will be the
termination of the ore pool. It will mean
a terrific war in prices by all the mining
companies of Northern Michigan and
Wisconsin.
A TWO-MAN TRUST.
Carnegie and Rockefeller Now Control
the Steel Monopoly.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 10.â The Tribune
this morning says: A "two-man" trust
has arisen out of the ruins of the great
steel pool, which recently collapsed. Car
negie and Rockefeller are the parties
named. It is said that Rockefeller, who
controls the iron mines in the Mesaha
range and owns railroads, docks and
boats, approached Carnegie with a propo
sition for an offensive and defensive
alliance. A combination was formed
which can make steel and sell it all over
the world at a price giving a practical
monopoly. __________^__
LOS ANGELES MURDERER'S FATE.
Barthelman, the Slayer of His Wife, Sen
tenced to Death on the Gal
lows.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 10.â An im
pressive scene was witnessed in Judge
Smith's department of the Superior Court
here to-day. John Barthelman, sewing
machine agent, recently convicted of wile
murder, was before the court tor sentence.
An able and aggressive lawyer bad em
ployed every device known to his profes
sion to obtain a new trial for his client.
Barthelman's defense was that of "tem
porary insanity." The jury had decided
that the defendant was sane when he de
liberately killed bis wife and was, there
fore, responsible for the murder.
One of the principal contentions on be
half of a new trial was that testimony not
expert had been admitted by the court as
to the mental condition of the defendant.
Counsel urged that such testimony, to be
competent, must be that of "intimate ac
quaintance or friends." Upon this point
Judge Smith reviewed the decisions of the
Supreme Court of this State for several
years past. He showed that the tendency
of the Supreme Court in ail cases involv
ing the question was broad and liberal,
and designed to do away with some of the
rigid rules that were still in force in some
of the States.
The principal objection had been made
to City Jailer Robbins' testimony. He
had Barthelman under his supervision for
about a week from the time of his arrest,
immediately after the defendant bad
killed his wife, until the preliminary ex
amination. He testified that from his ob
servation of Barthelman in the City Jail,
from conversations bad with him and
from his actions, he considered him sane.
As to the contention that no motive had
been shown, the court held tbat if ever
there was a case in which the motive was
seen from start to finish it had been this
one. The motion for a new trial was then
formally denied, and Barthelman was or
dered to stand up. Without tremor be
beard his sentence. The court stated that
by virtue of his oflice and his duty he or
dered John F. Barthelman committed to
the custody of the Sheriff, to be by him
taken to the State penitentiary within ten
days from the dateof sentence and turned
over to the Warden of the prison, and
that upon a day and date to be hereafter
named in the warrant of execution, the
Warden sbould hang him by the neck un
til he was dead.
SAN BERNARDINO CHARITY.
Proceeds of an Orange Sale to Be Sent to
Suffering Armenians.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 10.â Of the
many plans proposed of late to render
financial aid to the Armenian sufferers by
means of the surplus products of tbe
country none has been found to be more
practicable than that suggested and car
ried forward to a successful issue by Rev.
W. H. McDougal o* Claremont, San Ber
nardino County. His plan was to procure
donations of oranges, ship them to New
York and sell them at auction, the pro
ceeds to be immediately telegraphed to
the unfortunates in Armenia. A lull car
load has been collected, and is now in
transit for the metropolis. The railroads
generously collected and will convey the
fruit to New York free of charge, tive lines
assisting in the benefaction. There has
been no charge at the warehouses, and the
promise of free auction in New York has
been made. It 13 also likely that the price
received will be large, as the purpose of
the undertaking will be known.

Collier Mackinaw Carried
Ashore on Marrow
stone Point.
Fast Sinking in the Sand, and
It Is Feared She Cannot
Be Floated.
Disabled Steering Gear tbe Cause.
She Lies Exposed to Wind aud
Swift Tides.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. 10.â
The steam collier Mackinaw, Captain Lit
tlefield. which left Tacoma at 11 o'clock
last night bound for San Francisco, went
aground at Marrowstone Point, directly
opposite this city, at 3 o'clock this morn
ing and is still bard and fast on the beach.
- The accident, whicb promises to result
more seriously than was at first antici
pated, was directly attributable to dis
abled steering-gear, which was dis
covered to be out of order soon after the
vessel left the dock at Tacoma. The trip
from Tacoma was made in safety, but just
as the huge craft was rounding Marrow
stone Point her rudder jammed, leaving
the Mackinaw at tbe mercy of a fierce tide
rip, which has before this piled vessels up
at the spot. It was but a very few mo
ments before the vessel: prow stuck into
the beach, and the tide soon put her
broadside on. Captain Littlefield, after
making a survey of the vessel's position,
came here for assistance.
The tugs Holyoke and Magic were at
ones dispatched to tbe scene, but
the combined strength of both, to
gether with the Mackinaw's engines,
going full speed astern, failed to budge
her. The vessel struck at half tide, but
tbe effort to release ber at full tide
brought realization of the fact that the
chances of floating her are decidedly few.
A force of twenty longshoremen at once
set to work discharging cargo upon light
ers, but the vessel, constantly settling
with every motion of the waves, disabled
the steam gear so much it was impossi
ble to use it for discharging. As a con
sequence this work will require two or three
days, during which time it is feared the
vessel will sustain severe damage, if she
does not break apart. The Mackinaw is
settling so rapidly that her bouses are
pulling asunder, indicating that the dam
age to the hull will be great.
As Boon as half cargo has been lightened
another attempt will be made to release
the vessel, which, if unsuccessful, will be
followed by an united pull by the entire
fleet of the Puget Sound'Towboat Co. The
opinion expressed here among shipping
men is that the vessel will never be
floated if the next attempt does not put
her into deep water. The Mackinaw lies in
an exposed position on a point where she is
open to the clean sweep of the wind that
may come up, and which would be certain
to imbed her deeper in the sands if not
break her up.
The tide runs like a millrace around
Marrowstone Point, making it particu
larly difficult and hazardous to approach
and leave the vessel during the progress
of discharging.
The tug people say tbe Mackinaw must
be iaised up three feet on her present draft
before it would be advisable to incur the
expense of another effort to get tbe
craft into deep water. This, in view
of the necessity of handling all the
coal, will require two or three days,
during which lime it is highly probable
that the heavy colliei will work herself
so deep into the sandy bed as to be inex
tricable. _.'â >-.â .
Captain Littlefield has proved himself
to be the right man in the right place, the
work of releasing the ship having been
well under way before either her San
Francisco or Tacoma agents had received
notification of the mishap. â¢ . .
Within three hours after the Mackinaw
struck an attempt had been made to get
her clear of the beach and tbis failing a
force of men were at work discharging
ber cargo, whicb was made up of 4000 tons
of coal.
The Mackinaw is owned by tbe Saginaw
Steel Steamship Company of Saginaw,
Mich., by which she was' built in 1890.
The next year sbe came around the Horn
under charter to the Oregon Improvement
company by which she has been operated
continuously ever since in the local carry
ing trade between Tacoma and San Fran
cisco. The Mackinaw is a sister ship to the
Keweenaw, which, with the collier Mont
serrat, foundered with all bands off Cape
Flattery in a fierce storm three winters
a{.o, when so many vessels were lost.
Despite the fact that the big Mackinaw
has been operated in all sorts of water on
the coast for six years this is her first ac
cident, a fact highly complimentary to
her skipper, Captain Littlefield.
IN IRONS AT SAN DIEGO.
Two White Men and a Chinaman Heavily
Manacled on the Government
' . Vessel Marion.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Feb. 10.â Seventeen
months ago the United States steamship
Marion left San Francisco on a southern
cruise. It arrived here on Sunday from
Iquique, via Acapulco, and although the
men were eager to go ashore, not more
than twenty out of the 200 sailors and
marines have yet been given leave.
On the vessel are two white men and a
Chinaman in heavy irons. One of them,
a pale-faced Englishman named Edwin
Young, was found to-day on an old chest,
with irons on his wrists and ankles. His
limbs have been badly chafed by tbe man
acles, and he was in a very uncomfortable
condition. He bas been in double irons
for nearly five months. Tbe other white
man is an assistant fireman who refused
to do duty and was put in irons about ten
days ago. The Chinaman's offense was
smuggling liquor aboard. â¢Â£>' :...
Captain Green has been compelled, he
says, to enforce the strictest military dis
cipline, inasmuch as he claims to have
found the crew in frightful shape physi
cally and morally when he took command
at iquique, after the transfer of Captain
Muliins about five months ago. Young,
while on shore, got drunk and assaulted a
corporal and master-at-arms, for which
the captain bad him ironed to await a
general court-martial. His trial will take
place before long. .v

Chinese Barred J"rom Vancouver Mines.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. 10. -Great
satisfaction is expressed here by the people
in general at the decision of the lull bench
of the Supreme Court of British Columbia,
to the effect that the Provincial Le isla
tion restraining Chinese from working
underground in coal mines is constitu
tional and enforcible. Tbe act has
hitherto not been carried into operation,
and in default of this Chinese have been
rapidly ousting white workers from the
coal fields of Comox, Wellington and
Nanaimo, Vancouver Island. The deci
sion now given will, it is expected, lead
to the dismissal of nnndreds of Chinese
colliers and the employment of white
workers in their stead.
WATSONVILLE DAMAGE SUIT.
Counsel for the Western Beet Sugar Com
pany Answers the Allegations of
James Struve.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Feb. 10.â A mo
tion for nonsuit in the case of James
Struve against the Western Beet Sugar
Company of Watsonville for $20,000 dam
ages was made by Samuel M. Shortridge,
attorney for tbe defendant, this afternoon
at tl c close of plaintiff's evidence in the
Superior Court. Mr. Shortridge occupied
the whole of the afternoon session in an
exhaustive argument in defense of his
motion and will continue to-morrow at
9:30 o'clock. ,
The intent of this action, he said, was to
abate an alleged nuisance with incidental
damages to property and to person. It
did not appear from the evidence adduced
by the plaintiff that the pulp pile or the
liquid from it, or the liquid from tbe
flume was a nuisance, or that the land
had been injured, or that the defendant
was the owner of the land, or that any
pulp was on plaintiff's iand. Plaintiff
was guilty of laches in commencing his
action two or three years after the expira
tion of the legal time allowed for the
bringing of such actions, and had refused
to allow defendant to keep the liquid
discharged off the land. He had con
tributed to his own injury. He had ac
quiesced in all the acts of the defendant
and allowed defendant to acquire pre
scriptive rights.
lt did. not appear from theevidence that
the land containing the pulp pile was the
property of the defendant. Mr. Short
ridge asserted that, in fact, the land be
longed to the Watsonville Creamery and
Cattle Company, and that company, if
any one, was responsible.
The pulp pile had not been shown to be
a public or private nuisance, and numer
ous authorities upon the legal definition
ofa nuisance were cited, they holding that
everything must be looked at from a rea
sonable point of view; the locality and all
surrounding circumstances should be con
sidered, and where extensive works have
been erected and carried oa which are
useful and needful, as is the case in this
sugar factory, persons cannot stand on ex
treme rights to bring an action in respect
to every trifling annoyance. Otherwise
business could not be carried on.

Widow and Orphans.
COVELO, Cal., Feb. 10.â Human blood
has flowed again in California's "dark
and bloody ground." This morning at 8
o'clock Dick Mahler, otherwise known as
"Deaf Dick," shot and killed Tom Steel,
a Cherokee half-breed, on account of
trouble that had been brewing some time.
Mahler leased some of Steel's reserva
tion land, and all lived together. After
breakfast Mahler spoke to Steel about a
sack of wheat. This led to hot words,
tben blows. The latter being much the
larger man landed repeated blows on
"Deaf Dick's" face. Finally he stopped
beating Mahler at the request of
Knuckles," his father-in-law. Die*:
pulled a 44-caliber revolver and shot Steel
just as he was entering the kitchen door,
six feet away. He dropped and immedi
ately expired. The ball entered his body
above the hip joint and ranged downward.
Dick came to town, a distance of four
miles, and gave himself up. He is a full
blooded Indian from the south fork of the
Yuba River, and bas been considered a
peaceable man. .
Neither man had been drinking re
cently. Steel leaves a widow and chil
dren. Judge Evelyn held an inquest
to-day.

DUCKWORTH NOT TO BLAME
Chief Clerk Triumphs Over
His Enemies in the
Assembly.
PERMITTED TO RESUME
HIS POSITION.
Vote Results in His Favor After
a Bitter Clash Between
Factions.
FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO APPLY
GAG RULE.
Tactics of His Foes Win Friends for
the Man Whom They Sought
to Besmirch.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Feb. After
a fiery session continuing for more than
three hours, full of dramatic situations, in
the presence of the largest crowd that has
been gathered in the Assembly chamber
since the beginning of the present session,
under the inspiration of earnest speeches
by men who lelt keenly what they were
saying, and after a most manly and mas
terly defense on the floor of the House by |
the man upon whose shoulders an erring
body was trying to dump its own political
sins, Chief Clerk Duckworth was rescued
from a position of peril and was allowed
to resume his station at the desk in the
face of bis enemies, officially absolved
from all stain of blame.
Had he been a man of less force, of less
ability, of less adroitness, of less man
hood; bad his friends wavered for even a
single instant in that trying hour, he
would now be a private citizen with an
official brand of shame upon his brow,
burned there by the highest authority of
the State. Every member of the Assem
bly, save Moultrie of Fiesno, who has
been dangerously ill since tbe beginning
of the session, took part in the exciting
proceedings, and every one oi those
seventy-nine, with the ignoble exception
of Malcolm of Santa Clara, placed his
name on record on the rolicall as either
for or against the dismissal in disgrace of
the chief clerk.
As Malcolm trembled and fell down in
the senatorial contest at the beginning of
the session, so to-day he fell down before
the light of an important issue, and
sneaked away in a sinister shadow just
before the call of the roll. During the
three hours p receding that event he occu
pied a prominent place on the floor, now
flourishing in his hand a paper bearing a
protest against the report ol the commit
tee censuring the members, now offering
an amendment and now rising to ques
tions of information or of per-onal priv
ilege. He was a figurehead on the ship of
state, but when the name of Malcolm was
reached on tbe roll the House knew him
no more. He bad vanishedâ evaporated
like the mist irom the tules in the light of
the rising sun.
Waymire of Alameda, although be did
not evade the issue, was next in point of
undesirable prominence. When he gave
the reply in answer to a question by Clerk
Duckworth that he had not summoned ex-
Sergeant-at-arms Parkinson as a witness
before the investigating committee and
that it had been testified that Parkinson
had procured the appointment of no less
than eighteen attaches on the temporary
roll the House held its breath. Then when
Caminetti of Amador in a voice oi thun
der demanded why Mr. Waymire and his
committee had not censured Parkinson
when he had censured Caminetti for hav
ing procured the appointment of a small
boy as page there was a mariner of ap
plause from spectators and members
alike. . .
From that moment the star of the
prosecution began to wane, and it almost
vent into eclipse when the baited clerk
charged Waymire and his committee with
bad faith; with inconsistency; with the
grossest injustice in refusing to make
charges against him ; with having neglected
to notify him tbat he had been accused of
any crime or wront-doing whatever; with
having informed him that he was not on
trial, and then with bringing in a resolu
tion in tbe name of the chairman censur
ing him and asking for hi" dismissal.
At the outset an effort was made to deny
the accused clerk an opportunity of speak
ing in his own delense, and this effort was
so persistent, so malicious and so spiteful
that several members, their cheeks red
oehing with indignation, jumped to their
feet and protested against the Spanish
method of gagging and shooting a pris
oner first and trying him afterward.
There is no doubt that this coarse attempt
to trample upon the right of the clerk to
defend himself made friends for him out
of several members who had made up
their minds to vote for bis dismissal, but
whose manhood recoiled from an act so
Cowardly and so unjust.
Long before 2 o'clockâ the hour set on
the special file for consideration of the
report of the committee of investigation â
the galleries and the lobby outside of the
rail were crowded. So many ladies sat in
the front row in the gallery, so many had
seats on the floor, attired in their best
promenade dresses, their biggest plumed
and flower-gardened hats, that the As
sembly chamber resembled the auditorium
of a theater during a matinee performance,
with Speaker Coombs as the heaw trage
dian. This resemblance was made all the
more real by the handclapping and the
cheers by members and spectators at every
striking point made in the proceedings.
And when the call of the roll was done
and the men cheered and the women
waved tbeir handkerchiefs and the mem
bers crowded around the chief clerk to
shake him by the hand' and congratulate
him upon his vindication, one would have
thought that some issue of vital impor
tance to the people of the State had been
settled and that an ever-to-be-memorable
page had been added to the history of Cal
ifornia.
It was manifest from the very start that
the details of the fight for and against the
clerk bad been well and carefully ar
ranged, for Speaker Coombs had barely
finished his announcement of the order of
business before Dibble of San Francisco
was on his feet moving the previous ques
tion so as to shut off a debate in which
disagreeable things might be said by the
minority.
Democrat Caminetti and Populist Shan
ahan rose to points of order, but were im
paled'upon: them. Then Mead offered a
resolution to the effect that the names of
the censured members who bad recom
mended the appointment of attaches on
the temporary roll should be stricken off
the report. This was changed so as to ex
cept those members who were not present
and did not join in tbe report of the mile
age committee recommending the pay
ment of one week's mileage to the tempo
rary attaches for one day's work.
Price, the Republican - member from
Sonoma, declared tbat the members who
were not present when the report of the
Mileage Committee was read bad violated
their duty in neglecting a business of so
much importance, and that the whole
committee was deserving of .censure. .'
In his most vigorous manner Caminetti
objected to a vote of censure upon 'he
members named in the report of Mr.
Waymire's cdnimittee, because those
members had not been granted a trial. He
asked for an opportunity to defend him
self deiore tbe committee and before tbe
House, and he declared that until he had
been tried in that way he would deny the
right of the committee or of the House to
pass a vote oi censure upon him. He ad
mitted that be had procured the appoint
ment of a very small boy as page, but he
had never met Mr. Duckworth and had
never known him until Mr. Duckworth
had called the House to order on the brat
day of the session.
Judge Waymire. pale with suppressed
emotion, arose in his chair and with some
show of indignation announced that Mr.
Caminetti bad been subpenaed. had ap
peared before the committed, the commit
tee bad granted a patient bearing to every
thing be had to say and be (Caminetti)
had admitted the truth of all with which
he bad been charged. He had had his
trial, and the assumption that he had not
been fairly treated was utterly without
foundation.
Bettman of San Francisco, in a white
beat and a scarlet necktie, denied the as
sertion in the report that those members
who had previously served in the House
were more to blame than the new mem
bers. Then Mr. Bettman struck a tragic
and defiant attitude and the crowd
laughed.
Dibble called attention to the fact that
his name appeared in the committee's re
port of censure. He had procured tbe ap
pointment of a very little boy (smaller
than Caminetti's boy) as page, and he did
not believe that he or any of the other
members should be censured.
Bettman regretted that be had not been
successful in getting more appointments,
and Price admitted having obtained two,
but he did not think he had done any
thing criminal.
Speaker Coombs declared himself op
posed to the adoption of the report. He
did not believe it to be the desire of the
committee to censure innocent persons.
Caminetti explained that be had merely
received a subpena to testify before the
committee against the clerk at the desk.
He did not think at that time that he was
there as a criminal on trial, and had never
been so informed.
One of the most manly and straightfor
ward speeches of the debate was that of
Cross, a Republican member from Los
Angeles.
"Every member within hearing of my
voice should be censured," he said, "if for
nothing else than approving of the pay
roll. I am not charged with having a
man on the payroll, but I did have one
and I will stand under it. Every member
here bad a right to protest against the ap
proval of that payroll, and should have
done it."
Among those who voted for the adop
tion of the report as amended was Guy of
San Diego.
Several amendments to the report were
offered, one by Mead to expunge from the
report the following:
The testimony shows that a portion of the
attaches were appointed with the knowledge
and at the request of members, as follows, and
we think the members who requested ap
pointments or lent their names to justify
ihem arc specially deserving oi censure.
Another amendment was by bridgeford,
absolving such members as bad requested
the chief clerk to make appointments lor
them on the temporary roll witbout
knowing how mviy appointments were
to be made.
Another was by Malcolm, to expunge
certain lines in tbe report censuring the
members.
Up to this time Jones of San Francisco
had not taken any part in the discussion,
put he saw an opportunity to take a hand
in the scrimmage and he did so.
"It seem 3to me," he said, "that the
gentlemen are trying to crawl out of a
very small hole. "l placed a man on this
roll myself. I have never done anything
dishonorable in my life. After "I bad
asked for this one man I expect there'
were twenty others asked me lor the use
of my name, and I said that they were
perfectly free to use my name if they
could get on tbe roll by so doing. Ido
not consider that I did wrong. Stand up
like men and take your medicine and
don't crawl underneath the desk when the
bullets begin to fly."
After much discussion Waymire's reso
lution requiring temporary attaches not
entitled thereto to refund the mileage paid
to them was carried. This was followed
by the Waymire resolutions calling for
the chief clerk's dismissal from office.
Dibble moved the indefinite postponement
of the resolution, ana the motion was de
feated by the following vote:

total 40.
After the announcement ofthe vote the
committee report was adopted and the
dramatic scene of the day took place. Hill
of Humboldt moved that the Chief Clerk
be allowed to speak on the door ofthe As
sembly in his own defense, but North of
Alameda objected.
"Give him a chance to be heard," cried
several members.
"1 am opposed to gag law," shouted
Cross, rising from his chair and glancing
fiercely at North across the aisle.
"1 will not vote upon the main ques
tion," said Burnett, a fusionist from San
Luis Obispo. â¢ _. v â¢
"I will vote," said Caminetti. "when the
Chief Clerk and the men who smuggled
those names on the roll are censored."
Much excitement prevailed at this time.
A dozen or more Assemblymen were on
their feet in different parts of the chamber.
Speaker Coombs suggested that the House
might give unanimous consent to allow
Mr. Duckworth to speak, and North of
Alameda, after explaining that his objec
tion arose because of his belief that such a
proceeding was without precedent, with
drew his objection.
â¢As Mr. Duckworth came forward from
his desk and stood leaning on a heavy
stick in the middle aisle, in front of the
desks of the newspaper correspondents,
the hubbub was hushed and a deep silence
fell upon the Assembly. The chief clerk's
swarthy cheeks glowed and his dark eyes
blazed with the intensity of his emotions.
Turning toward the Speaker ant! then
facing the bouse, he began:
"Mr. Speaker and gentlemen of the
Assembly: i am here ready to answer any
questions that may be propounded by any
member of this House in connection with
any act of mine bearing directly or in
directly upon the appointment of those
whose names figure on the roll of th.
temporary organization of this House."
The clerk's voice was clear and pene
trating. It betrayed but little emotion,
save a suggestion of intensity of feeling,
and its lowest tones penetrated to the
most distant corners of thechamber.
"I have not solicited the privilege of ad
dressing tbe members of this House at
this time," he went on. "The offer comes
from the gentleman from Humboldt and
tbe gentleman from ban Luis Obispo, to
whom I am deeply indebted for this cour
tesy. I did not ask for the privilege of
tbe floor on this occasion, and I have no
desire to consume the time ol tbe House,
as you are here with the eye of the people
of tbis State upon you, or .to waste any
more of the people's time than has already
been wasted upon this question. But Ido
stand here before the bar of the House, in
the presence of its perfectly solid mem
bership, ready to answer any questions
that may be propounded to me; and, Mr.
Speaker, I now await the pleasure of the
chair."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, IS9T.
A round of band-clapping followed the
conclusion oftbe clerk's remarks, and Hill
of Humboldt asked whether it was true
that Duckworth had said tbat if the law
was not changed and that if h- opened
the next session of the Legislature he
would bankrupt tbe contingent fund, even
if be had to appoint a thousand attaches
to do it.
"Mr. Speaker." replied Duckworth,
"the statement to which the gentleman
from Humboldt refers was made at a
time when the promise held out to me
four years ago was being fulfilled. Four
years ago it become my duty as a member
of this Assembly to participate in a Re
publican caucus for United States Sena
tor. One of the candidates whose name
was to he submitted to that caucus was
M. H. de Young of the* San Francisco
Chronicle. Because of pledges exacted of
me by my constituents in the campaign
preceding my election I refused to coun
tenance the candidacy of Mr. de Young.
His managers then held out to me a glow
ing promise that whenever my head
should bob up in connection with any
public matter the warts would be burned
off me. Faithful to that promise to
the people of my county I said to bis rep
resentatives that 1 was willing to have
those warts burned off, but that at least I
could return to my constituents with my
bands clean and be able to look every one
of them in the face.
''Of all the papers in California the San
Francisco Chronicle, owned by Mike de
Young, is the newspaper that has led all
this criticism of me, and it is the news
paper that is responsible for whatever
public sentiment may exist in regard to
this matter. A representative ot that
paper came to talk to mo on this matter
and a representative of tbe Sacramento
Bee, which paper bad been acting in con
cert with the Chronicle, and, figuratively
speaking, nailed me to the cross with
questions at a time when I was laboring
under great nervous excitement and
under that heavy strain whicb culminated
in my collapse, and they demanded to
know and asked me in relation to thing..
pertinent and impertinent concerning the
temporary organization. I did say â when
for three or four nights I had been unable
to get one wink of sleepâ when 1 realized
that mv career would be cut short if that
infamous journal could bave its own way -
I did say under the excitement of the
moment l did use that expression, and I
have regretted it every minute of my life
ever â that I would exhaust the con
tingent fund tbe next time even if I had
to employ a thousand attaches."
Caminetti asked when the additional
names were added to the roll and Duck
worth replied that it was at a subsequent
time when members on the floor asked to
have the names added, and when the
Speaker announced that if there was no
objection the names would be added by
the journal clerk as corrections. Dennery
of San Francisco vouched for the state
ment of the chief clerk as correct.
In reply to a question by Robinson of
Nevada Mr. Duckworth said that the tem
porary organization was effected when he
was directed by the Speaker to notify the
Senate that the Assembly was organized
and ready for business.
"Were you responsible for the payment
of those salaries?'' asked Dennery.
"No, sir," replied the chief clerk. "The
gentlemen will remember that they made
the request of me for appointments, I said
that I was willing to put, their names on,
but tbat they would* have to attend to
the salary matter themselves."
Then came another dramatic episode.
Caminetti asked Waymire if ex-Sergeant
at-Arms Parkinson had been subpenaed,
and Waymire replied that no subpena had
been served on him. v- . 'â¢* _
"I thought his testimony was not neces
sary because be bad made no appoint
ments. It would be an unnecessary ex
pense and would do no good."
"In reply to Judge Waymire, I desire to
say tbat Parkinson sent word to me that
he was at home ready to be subpoenaed
and to come before the committee and
swear to those facts," said Duckworth.
"His testimony would not bave relieved
the members ot any of the odium," replied
Mr. \Vaym-re.
- "Mr. Parkinson was an officer of this
House," shouted Caminetti. "and he had
eighteen names on that temporary roll,
and yet Judge Waymire presented a re
port to this House censuring me and re
fuses to censure tbe man who put eigh
teen names on the roll."
Caminetti was applauded and the Speak
er called both gentlemen to order.
Duckworth proceeded to pour hot shot
into the committee. He said: - .** _-v,'
"If you believe my testimony at that
ex-parte investigation after I, through my
legal representative, requested that speci
fications should be furnished me of the
charges I would have to meet and they
were not furnished, any my lawyer
stated there that if there was a reputation
to be lost, or a man to be sacrificed, or a
name to be dishonored it was mine. Not
withstanding that, he was told that
Duckworth was not on trial. If
you feel that because of the good
ness of my heart I yielded to the
pressure of the almost peremptory de
mand to place names on the temporary
roll; if you feel that because there
are som-. members upon tbe floor
of this House who now refuse to
stand by their own acts and are trying to
grind me into the ground; if you feel it is
a proper, a manly, a decent, an honorable,
an American way of getting out ot it I
am willing that you shall dismiss me from
office.
The ballot was then taken with the fol
lowing result:

COYOTE CLAIMS
BILL IS DOOMED
Little Prospect That the
Measure Will Pass at
This Session.
Committee on Finance Guarding
Against a Fraudulent
Treasury Raid.
Investigation Will Begin as Soon as
Important Work Now in Hand
Is Disposed Of
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 10.â
the matter now stands, there is little
prospect that the coyote bounty claim bill
will pass at this session of the Legislature.
It is the general desire of the Committee
on Finance, in whose hands the bill now
is, to bave all the honest claims paid at
the earliest day, but at the same time the
members feel it incumbent on them to
prevent gross fraud on the State and the
looting of the treasury.
Another conference took place to-day
between the Governor and some of the
members of the Finance Committee, with
a view to securing the co-operation of the
Chief Executive in the work of segregat
ing the genuine from the fraudulent
claims, but it resulted as fruitlessly as the
first meeting.
Senator Wolfe's resolution, giving the
Finance Committee full power to go into
the investigation of this matter, was
passed by the Senate by a vote of 83 to 6.
The work of investigation will begin as
soon as the most important bills are out
of the way.
The Governor explained to the commit
tee that the reason for withholding the
information tbat would aid it in deter
mining the character of the claims is tbat
the submission of such data would inter
fere with the criminal prosecution of those
who have sworn falsely in securing their
scalp certificates.
Added interest has been created in this
matter by the receipt by every member of
the Legislature of tbe report made by the
Kern County Grand Jury relative to the
frauds alleged to have been perpetrated in
that county. In this document is incor
porated the results of the investigations
made by Edgar Moore, who bad been en
gaged as an expert to look into this and
other subjects. .Underthe heading, "No
torious Coyote-scalp Frauds," . Moore
says:
It will be for you to determine whether or
not the Board oi Supervisors and the c.erk
have not entered Into a conspiracy with some
other parties to deiraud tbe State out oi enor
mous amounts oi money ln this matter. Cer
tainly their action, with their inevitable
fraudulent results, would indicate as much.
The clerk referred to is H. L. Packard,
who is now here working to secure the
passage of the bill. Farther along Moore
submits a statement showing that certifi
cates for 6835 scalps have been assigned to
Packard, and adds:
There can be no question as to a large
amount of the foregoing being fraudulent. As
there was no destruction by fire, as required
by law, the same scalp could be sold a number
oi times before it would become unsalable, es
pecially as the clerk who had to receive them
was buying all that were offered at figures that
woula leave him a good profit. It is possible
that his desire to make a profit so hlinued him
that he wouid accept even a doe's sea!
H. L. Packara. the ex-Deputy Clerk and clerk
of the board, should be ca led belore you and
questioned as to the ownership of the certifi
cates still on hand acd to his buying of scalps
for himself or any one else; as to the raised
certificates, raised affidavits, the Issuance of
certificates when no affidavits were on file or
any entry upon the registers; the entering of
amounts ol scalps on the register with no
accompanying affidavit and the issuance of
certificates of same, and to the signing of
sundry affidavits with a cross without any
witness oi tame, and to the identity of the
persons whose names are given in the list oi
supposed fraudulent certificates.
Much of the information concerning
tbe_*e sculp frauds .was obtained from the
District Attorneys of the counties in
which the largest frauds are alleged to
have been perpetrated. These, according
to the records ol the Board of Examiner*,
with the number of scalp bounties claimed
in each, are as follows:
Fresno 7,043
Kern 15,095
Tulare 10,314
San Luis Obispo 3,695
Kings .'. 1,075
Lassen 3,680

coyote bounty claims. Albert S. Earl is

resignation.
LOOKING OUT IOK SHEEHAN.
The General Opposes Mcl ten's Xosemite
Valley Measure.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 10.âMe
lick's resolution to restore to the National
Government the Yosemite Valley and Big
Tree Grove has rendered more cr leas pre
carious the fat job of General John F.
Sheehan, who receives $75 per month as
secretary of the Yosemite Commission. If
the resolution should be adopted and the
National Government should take pos
session of the valley and relieve the State
of California of the great expense of tak
ing care of it, the general would lose bis
$75 per month â not a large sum of money,
but one which, added to the salaries he re
ceives for other secretaryships and posi
ticns, helps to make the muckle of many
nrr k_l3.
Tne general has, therefore, girded on
his armor, and has come to Sacramento
to save the valley for himself and the
Commissioners.. His first broadside came
to-day in the shape of a type-written let
ter signed with the general's autograph
and addressed with the general's own
hand to each and every member of the
Assembly. He also made alliances with
Assemblymen from counties adjacent to
the park, wuose sheep have been allowed,
by the kindness of the Commissioners, to
graze on the fat pastures of the valley,
and who fear that, Bbould this beautiful
scenic region fall into the hands of the
Government, the soldiers would drive off
their flocks.
The appeal, being made to self-interest,
was temporarily successful, for when As
sembly concurrent resolution No. 2 was
taken up as a special order on to-day's file
immediately after tne reading of the jour
nal it was voted down. Keables gave
notice of a motion to reconsider, so that
the resolution may yet be saved. Friends
of the resolution propose to show what a
large sum of money would be saved to the
State if the National Government should
assume control of- the property and how
all the abuses of which so much complaint
has been and is being made would be
wined out. '
Professor John Muir of the Sierra Club
is here, working for the passage of the
resolution. As every one knows, the pro
fessor's love for the scenic beauties of the
Yosemite is untarnished by politics. He
is an ardent lover of natu'e, and his arti
cles published here and in the East have
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
attracted widespread attention to Cali
fornia, her unsurpassed climate and soil
and her unequaled products.' He believes
that the valley will be kept in the best of
order by tbe National Government and
tbat its scenic beauties will be preserved
under National control.
The following is General Sheehan's let
ter:
John F. Sheehan.

Financial Broker.

Savings Bank.
Hon. .Dear I desire to call your attention to
a resolution offered ln the Assembly by Hon. W.
6. Meltck in reference to restoring to the Na
tional Government the grant known as ihe
Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Big Tree Grove,
containing about 38,000 acres of land.
This Kraut was solicited by the State of Cali
fornia from the National Government, and in
June, 18-54. Congress passed an act confirm
ing it to the Staie of California, conditioned
that this State would use the same for the
benefit oi the public as a resort ana for recrea
tion.
Considering the high celebrity which
Yosemite has given to California, the cost to
the State to manage Yosemite and the Big
Tree Grove has been very light indeed. Hun
dreds of foreigners are attracted annually to
this State, generally for the purpose of view
ing the wonders of Yosemite, and were it not
for this attraction a large majority of these
people would pass to and from the Orient via
the Canadian Pacific route.
More than thirty-three years ago, when this
State was barely out of Its Infancy, it solicited
this grant from the Government of the United
Slates and now that we have grown great and
powerful it would appear pitiable and ridicul
ous to ask the Government to take it back
when it only costs to maintain it the pittance
ol $10,000 or $12,000 per year.
Again the examples we have before us of the
management of the mountain and forest
reservation surrounding Yosemite by the
United States troops ought to b. in Itself a
sufficient reason why the State should not de
sire to lose control of the Yosemite. During
the past season many prominent citizens of
California were arrested by the regular soldiers
stationed in the reservation for having any
kind oi firearms in their possession. Imagine
what annoyance campers and others who an
nually visit Yosemite would suffer there from
the lack of knowledge of the regulations oi the
regular army.
I speak for many citizens with whom I have
conversed that the proposition oi Melick
I should not be ior a moment considered by our
legislators.. It is not at all likely tbat the
National Government would want to take care
ol the buildings and roads and fences and
trails in Yosemite, all for the benefit of the
{ State oi California.
I am informed from reliable sources that
this proposition did not emanate irom the
brain of Mr. Melick, but was conceived by a
resident oi Los Angeles, who ls a crank on "the
proposition to divide the State and set aside
Southern California as a separate State gov
ernment, and having this in view he preferred
that Yosemite, famed all over the world,
should not be owned by Northern California,
but being claimed by the United States Gov
ernment would belong as much to Southern
California as to its northern sister.
I trust that you will deem It proper to op
pose the resolution, which I understand will
be argued on Wednesday, the 10th Inst, by
your voice as well as by your vote. Respect
fully yours, John F. Sheehan.
CONDEMN GOVERNOR BUDD.
Laboring Men Resent the Attack on the
State Printing Office.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 10.â Over
600 members of the organized labor unions
of this city marched in procession from
the Metropolitan Theater to-night to at
tend a mass-meeting which bad been called
for the purpose of demonstrating the
necessity of passing the appropriation
made in favor of the State Printing Office
over the Governor's veto, on the ground
that the veto meant the disruption of the
office and the lowering of wages.
. The crowd that packed the theater was
wildly enthusiastic, . and applauded
evry bit made by the speakers in
labor's favor with vehement ap
plause. E. I. Woodman, being selected as
chairman, introduced the first speaker of
the evening, H. Raphael, a representative
of the Cigarmakers' National Union, who
made an eloquent address in favor of labor
and its interests, in which he said:
"As far as organized labor is concerned,
I believe they will stand together as a
man, and they will be upheld by the or
ganize! bodies of not only this State but of
others," and he â â stigmatized the Gov
ernor's action in vetoing the State Print
ing Office appropriation as an attack, not
only on organized labor, but upon the
women wane-earners as well. -
W. B. Thorp, chairman of Committee
on Resolution-, then introduced the fol
lowing resolution, which was adopted by
a perfect storm of ayes that fairly shook
the House:
Whereas, The State Printing Office is recog
nized as one of the great bulwarks of organized
labor in the State of Calilornia; and whereas
.said institution under its present manage
ment, has been conducted on strict union
lines in all its branches, thus aiding and
assisting all honest craftsmen in the effort to
protect themselves against those who would
oppress labor and make the lot of the toiler
all the more burdensome; and whereas,
those of our fellow - Taborers employed in
said State Printing Office wno have
faithfully and honestly performed the task
alloted to them, rendering full value in labor
for every cent pall to them in wages, have
been attacked and maligned by the Governor
of this State undercover of a disagreement
Wjth the Superintendent -of State Print
ine; and, whereas, the continual war
fare being waged against said State
Printing Oflice and against the workers em
ployed therein has convinced us that the
Governor's object is not so much a reform of
alleged abuses as the uprooting of the institu
tion itself; and, whereas, we are re
gretfully forced to the conviction that the
Governor in the attitude he has assumed
toward the State Printing Office is either wit
i tingly or unwittingly playing into the hands
of the old schoolbook ring, which has in the
past few years been so tireless in its endeav
ors to destroy the ability of the State to protect
parents of school children from extortions and
exactions of former years; and whereas, the
statements contained in the Governor's mes
sage reflecting on the faithfulness and effi
ciency of the labor employed in said State
Printing Office are a gratuitous libel upon our
fellow-laborers and .co-workers employed
therein; therefore be it
Resolved, That as a preliminary proposition
this meeting declares that it detests a dema
gogue and abhors a politician who would at
tempt to make cheap personal political capi
tal at the expense of those who toil for their
daily bread.
Resolved, That the allied trades and labor
unions the city of Sacramento in mass
meeting assembled hereby express their em
phatic condemnation of the action of Governor
James H. Budd, in vetoing the act for the ap
propriation of money for the support of the
State Printing Office for the remainder of the
present fiscal year, and denounce as unjust
and untrue the insinuation against the faith
fulness and efficiency of the labor employed
in said office made by the Governor in his
message to the Legislature.
Resolved, That it is the declaration of this
meeting that unless the Governor's state
ments concerning the financial management
of that institution have better foundation in
fact than have his criticisms of the. labor there
employed, such statements are entirely mis
leading, devoid of truth and utterly unworthy
the Governor of a great State.
Resolved, That organized labor represented
by this mass-meeting here to-night, acting in
behalf of hundreds of wage-earners, both men
an/i women, employed in the State Print
ing Office, the payment of whose wages
for labor faithfully performed is dependent
upon the action of the Legislature at its ses
sion to-morrow, most earnestly and respect
fully petition the honorable members of said
Legislature to pass the bill for the mainte
nance of the said State Printing Office over the
veto of the Governor,
Resolved, That we warn said members of
the Legislature against taking' stock in any
accusations against the State Printing Office
until such accusations have been thoroughly
investigated by a competent non-partisan
committee of fair * men, for it is a â¢ mat
ter of public knowledge that a large
majority of such charges have their
origin with interested parties who hope to
break down that institution in order that they
may feed and fatten upon the taxpayers of the
State at their leisure, and that in their efforts
to accomplish this object they have often se
cured the co-operation of some of the highest
officials of the State*. . .'.ââ¢â¢.'
Resolved, That this mass-meeting hereby de-
Clares this matter a strictly non-partisan ques
tion, a question of simple justice and of the
protection of labor, and we appeal at this time
to Populist, Democrat and Republican alike
to stand with us in our resistance of the blow
aimed at organized labor by the Governor of
this State.
William Jenks of th. Army and Navy
League, on, behalf of that organization,
then presented the following resolution,
which was also unanimously adopted:
Headquarters U. S. Grant Camp,.
Abut and Navy League. }
At a special meeting ot U. S. Grant Camp No
5 held at these headquarters, the following
l ream ble and resolutions were unanimously
ad u'HEREAS. The action of the Governor in ve
toing the bill now pending in the Legislature
relative to appropriate. necessary muds to
main Tain the state Printing Office is a menace
to labor in that it impairs tne usefulness if. In
deed, it does not stop work altogether in the
State Printing Office, thereby throwing out of
employment many ex-soldh-rs and sailors,
their widows and children; and whereas, we
believe the governor has been misled by dis
charged employes aud by adherents of the
infamous book ring which stands ready to
again deluge our State with worthless and ex
pensive textbooks for our schools; ana
whereas, the Governor by his veto is posing
a majority of the lawmakers who see and
know the need of the State and its institutions
and who evidently are not antagonistic to
labor and fair play ior the State employes In
lied labor; therefore, . â__âº___
Resolved, By the members, of U. S. Gram
Camp No. ft. Arm y and Navy League of this
State, that we view this action el the Gov
ernor as threatening the Interests of labor,
belittling the State and utterly uncalled for,
and
Resolved, That we earnestly urge the mem
bers of the Legislature, in the name of labor
and ln memory oi the soldiers and sailors
who fought and bled to preserve this Union,
to stand as a solid phalanx and pass this meas
ure over the Governor's veto.
Resolved, That a copy hereof be read at the
mass-meeting to-night at Metropolitan Thea
ter and also a copy be furni-hed to every mem
ber of the Legislature and the press.
C. L. Meir, pastor of St. Paul's Episco
pal church, was the next speaker, and
after defining bis reasons for appearing'
on the platform it being because
he was a printer, he said the.., re
flection by Governor Budd against- the
the State Printing Office comes from one
who, while in authority, was no authority.
The reflection was not Republicanism,
Democratism, Populism or Americanism,
but was decidedly and solely Buddism and
the tenets of that faith were against ihu
Interests of the toilers, and provided for
so many holidays that a laboring man
in India could never get a solid week's
work.
Harry Rodgers, foreman of the State
Printing Office, presented a list of figures
to prove that the report of Expert Taylor
as presented to the Governor was either a
mass of errors or a wilful misrepresenta
tion.
He was followed by William Gormley,
who declared that the State Printing
Office bad tor years past been the butt of
attack of the corrupt book-printing ring
of the State. W. McArthur, president of
the Coast Seamen's Union, also addressed
tbe assemblage.

SAN JOSE CARNIVAL PLANS.
Board of Trade Takes the Initiative to
Arrange for a floral
Fete.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Feb. 10.â Board
of Trade has called a meeting of citizens
for next Tuesday evening at its rooms to
consider the proposition of holding a
carnival this spring. A number of busi
ness men and others nave expressed a
willingness to co-operate in such an
undertaking, and there seems to be little
doubt that a fiesta eclipsing the splendid
success of the rose carnival last year could
be got up.
There will be an abundance of flowers in
May and June. No expense of erecting a
pavilion, such as there was last year, will
have to be met, and it is believed tbat
with the experience gained San Jose will
be able to hold a festival that will attract
thousands of visitors to Santa i Clara
Valley. I

I have never met a more enthusiastic
class of people than I did in Salinas, and

One of the most pleasing gentlemen with
whom I talked is Mr. George Perrinl. He
told me that he had heard of many re
markable cures that had been effected by
the use of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla,
and that he had occasion to prove this to
his own advantage. ,
Some time ago his little daughter, Effle
Perrini, was covered with small sores. â  A
bottle of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla was
bought and very moderate doses were
given to the little girl. Before the entire
bottle was exhausted all the sores had dis
appeared and Effie got better. She con
tinued to improve until she is now a per
fectly healthy child. | He told me that he
bad recommended Joy's Vegetable Sarsa
parilla to many people and that every one
was now praising the native remedy.

Braunhart's Amendment to
the County Government
Bill Defeated.
Met the Opposition of the San
Francisco Delegation in
the Senate.
Bitter Words Bandied by Members in
Discussing the Proposed
Reductions.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 10.â There
was fun and frenzy both at the noon meet
ine of the Senate San Francisco delega
tion to-day, when it had under considera
tion the proposed amendment of Senator
Braunhart's to the county government
bill. This amendment provides for a re
duction in the number of register clerks in
the County Clerk's office from twelve to
four, assistant register clerks from twenty
four to thirteen and copyists from thirty
six to fifteen.
After Braunhart had explained the pur
pose of his bill, which was to reduce the
expenses of the County Clerk's office,
Deputy County Clerk Casey made a state
ment taken from the records, showing
that the business of all departments of
the City Government of Sau Francisco
had largely increased within the last fif
teen years, including that of the County
Clerk.
When Casey concluded he stated, as is
customary with those who appear before
committees, that he was ready to answer
any questions the Senators might desire
to ask. Chairman Mahoney addressed
Senator Braunhart, referring to him as
- the distinguished Senator from San Fran
cisco, with emphasis on the word distin
guished, and asked him if he had any
* thing to say.
. Senator Braunhart, scenting adverse
action on bin bill, witb considerable show
of spleen stated he did not desire to ask
any questions, as be knew nothing he
could say would have any effect on the
* delegation.
This aroused Senator Wolfe, who Indig
nantly protested against Braunhart's in
nuendoes. "1 want to protest again st these
insinuations," he said. "If the Senator
has introduced this bill merely to make
a record for himself or hi;- party, that fact
* should not give him the right to reflect on
the members of this committee. Andi
say, right here, if be can elicit any in
formation from Mr. Casey or from any
' other source that will prove his bill to be
. a good measure, 1 will vote for it witb
him."
"It is not pleasant for me," promptly
responded Braunhart, "to disagree with i
my colleagues, but 1 don't think anything
I can say would change the result with
this committee. I shall state whatever I *
have to say on the floor of the Senate. I j
have introduced this bill in good faith,
and think it ought to pass.
"Referring to the^e personalities," con
tinued the irate Senator, "I desire to avoid
them. I further desire to be referred to
simply as Mr. Braunhart, or Senator
Braunhart, and not as 'the distinguished
Senator.' If such reference is again made
I shall not answer it here, but from my
seat in the Senate." /
This was delivered with eyes and gest
ures directed at Chairman Mahoney. The
latter quickly replied:
"Then 1 wiil answer it." .
It was finally decided to report the bill
back with the recommendation that it do
not pass, Braunhart alone voting for his
measure.
Senator Mahoney presented the report
of the San Francisco delegation during
the alternoou session of the Senate.
Braunhart at once took the floor, opening
_as follows:
"I offered this amendment in good
faith, and I de-ie to call the attention of
tbe Senate to the existence of an evil in
San Francisco for which there seems to
be no redress. I assure the Senators tbat
it is not a pleasant task for me to appear
on the floor of tbe Senate alone to advo
cate this measure before the Senate. But
tbis is a wrong that calls aloud for re
dress. I desire every Senator to vote
upon this question intelligently, as it
may be presented in my humble manner.
. It is unpleasant to me to have to offer an
amendment that is opposed by the San
Francisco delegation."
He then entered upon an appeal for
economy and compared the expenses of
the County Clerk's office in San Francisco
with those in similar offices in other coun
ties â a comparison which, owing to the
vast differences in the amount of business
transacted in San Francisco and the coun
ties brought into the comparison, had very
little effect on the members. Senator
Wolfe spoke in favor of the adoption of
the committee's report.
"I regret,'' he began, "very much that
. it is necessary in the consideration of this
question to go into so much of the local
and political affairs of San Francisco.
Permit me to say," he continued, "that
we can dismiss from the consideration of
this question the charge made against the
present County Clerk, whose greatest of
fense in the eyes of the gentleman who
preceded me is that he is a Republican.
He charged that the County Clerk was
endeavoring to control the party in San
Francisco. 1 want to st* that he is not
in control of the party in San Francisco
âº-and that the party there is powerful and
strong enough to look after its own affairs
and the interests of the people without
any assistance from the gentleman re
ferred to.
"This matter is being discussed as if we
were trying to create more expense in
connection with the office of the County
Clerk. Let me state that the bill as re
ported by the County Government Com
mittee leaves the County Cleik's office in
the same position it has been in. I also
desire to state that the County Clerk does
not appoint all the clerks that he is per
mitted to appoint under the law, and that
every man now employed there is abso
lutely necessary to the proper conduct of
the office. â¢
â¢ "The proposed amendment is not ap
proved by the people of San Francisco,
who do not want salaries reduced, because
the clerks earn every dollar they receive.
I am not making this defense lor any pen
.li ileal reasons or for any personal reasons
but 1 don't propose to take for granted
anything UDon the mere statement of the
gentleman who has just spoken."
He referred to Deputy Casey's state
ment and the increase of business in all
departments of the City government.
The attention of the Senate was also
called to tbe fact tbat tbe people of San
Francisco would soon be called upon to
vote for a new charter, which would take
this question out of the Legislature's
hands in the future.
Braunhart closed the argument by de
* daring that it was a question of politics.
. "It is a matter of iceepirg a political
machine in power," he shouted. "It is a
[combination between the bosses, both Re
publican ami Democratic, wbo are non
(partisan. They desert their organiza
tions and affiliations. It is a communism
'of pelf that keeps them together."
The report of the San Francisco delega
tion that the Braunhart amendment do
not pass was adopted by a vote of 29 to 6,
and carried with it the defeat of the
amendment.
.After the adjournment of the Senate
Sam Rainey lay in wait for Braunhart and
took him severely to task for his asper
sions on the "heavenly twins" of San
Francisco. \ â¢ , !
Rainey had not heard the reference to
the "communism of pelf," and labored
under tbe impression that his name had
been mentioned on the floor of the Senate
by the San Francisco Senator. When
assured that no such advantage bad bee n
taken of him as to mention his sacred
name though every one present knew to
whom Braunhart referred â Rainey be
came mollified.
There are not those wanting, however,
who say that Braunhart was acting tinder
instructions from Rainey, in order to
make trouble for County Clerk Curry, and
that the lobby altercation was only
another dramatic fake to shield the power
behind the throne.
SINGLE- TAX AMENDMENT.
Senate Committee Determines to Report
It Favorably.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 10.â A fresh
impetus was given to the single-tax agita
tion In this State to-night by tbe action of
the Senate Committee in determining to
report favorably Bulla's constitutional
amendment which provides "that land
shall never be made exempt from taxa
tion except that owned by the United
States, this State, or by any county or mu
nicipal corporation within this State,"
and that "land ot the same quality or sim
ilarly situated, whether used or unused,
shall be assessed at the same value."
Should the Legislature approve the prop
osition, the next two years will be a cam
paign of education on the single-tax ques
tion throughout the State, and inthe elec
tion two years hence the people will have
the opportunity of deciding whether they
are ready to give the Legislature the
power to put the single-tax scheme into
operation. The amendment dees not
make it obligatory on the Legislature to
put the new theory of taxation into prac
tice, but simply gives it tbe power to do
so, if the people so signify to their legisla
tive representatives.
To Improve the Highways.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 10.â At the
meeting of the Senate Committee on
Roads and Highways it was decided to re
port favorably on the comprehensive sys
tem of State highways provided for in the
bills introduced by Senator Gleaves at the
request of the Bureau of Highways.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
"Chimmie Fadden" Continues
Its Success at the
Columbia.
Louis J.mes Has Not Made a Great
Draw of '"Spartrcus" Comedy at
the Alcez r.
"Chimmie Fadden" at the Columbia
Theater is proving the dramatic sensation
of the week. "Standing room only" is
the nightly rule, and there is not much
standing room for late comers.
The company has acted so long in this
Bowery comedy that the whole perfor
mance goes with a snap and vim generally
sought for in vain in traveling organiza
tions. Even the smallest details are care
j fully worked out, and the actors and act
resses in the long cast all give an interest-
I ing rendering of Townsend's familiar
â  characters. Miss Marie Baker, as the
bibulous Mrs. Murphy, rtroains the favor
ite, which she at once became on Monday
night
"Chimmie Faid en" will remain all
next week at the Columbia. Fanny Rice
follows. ,'-â¢â¢-
All Louis James' clever acting has not
been able to revive much public enthusi
asm in "Spartacus" at the Baldwin. The
large audiences are evidently reserving
their appearance till next week, when
James will give a repertoire including
"Hamlet," "Otbello,"and an adaptation of
one of Scribe's comedies, the English title
of which is "My Lord a.id Some Ladies."
The Alcazar is having a very prosperous
week with Gillette's sparkling comedy
"The Professor," which is well suited to
the talents of tbe stock company. Miss
Bertha Foltz is charmingly sincere and
natural as Daisy Brown, the child of the
woods, and J. B. Polk is thoroughly at
home as the guileless, love-making pro
fessor. I
"A Mile a Minute" is going well at the
Grand. It is a play in which vice threat
ens more than once to thoroughly outwit
virtue, and the gallery tremb es lest it
should be balked of its prey, the said prey
being an avaricious monster who has
committed parricide for the sake of gold.
It is needless to say, however, that before
the curtain finally falls the unnatural
monster meets with his deserts, not, how
ever, before a numberof sensational epi
sodes have taken place, one of which is
the pursuit of the villain by the hero in a
special engine.
"Aladdin," with its many brilliant
spectacular effects, is nearing the end of
its first edition at the Tivoli. Next week
a new addition, with many -new and at
tractive specialties, will be given.
Abra, Zebra and Vara, new equilibrists,
have become popular favorites at the
Orpheum; John and Bertha Gleason's
dancing also wins applause and encores.
Next week there will be a number of
changes in the bill. Among the new acts
will be a farce comedy, presented by the
Hayes Brothers and Emily Lytton.
There will be an almost entire change of
programme when the great singer Tre
t-elli gives her second concert at tbe Cali
fornia Theater on Saturday afternoon,
though, by request. Mile. Trebelli will sing
three of the numbers that she sang at tbe
California Theater on Tuesday night. Ar
rangements have been made for the first
appearance at tbe Saturday afternoon and
Sunday night concerts of Herr Weiss, the
famous 'cellist player from Buda-Pestb.
There will be no concert on Tuesday
night, as originally intended, owing to
the fact tbat "Our Little Cinderella" Com
pany will occupy the entire week.
The following programme will be per
formed on Saturday afternoon in Golden
Gate Hall at the concert of the Heine trio:
Trio, Op. 1 (Xavler Schnrwenka), Adagio
sostenuto; Allei.ro con brio; Andaiitino quasi
Allegretto; Scherzo, vivace; rinale, A:iegro
molto quasi presto. Vr c.-il soli, (a) "Waid
wenderung." (_>. "Ich Liebe Dlch" (Grieg);
violin 8011, (a) "Romance" (Sinding), (6) "Bo
lero" (Moszkowskl), Miss L. Florence Heine;
vocal solo, To An. hea" (Hatton), William T.
Andrews; Trio, Op. 49 (Mendelssohn), Molto
Allegro ed agitato; Andante con moto;
Scherzo, Leggiero c vivace; Finale, Allegro
ass&i.
To Tell About Shakei-peam.
A specially attractive lecture, or rather two
lectures, will be given to-night at Gulden Gate
Hall under the auspices of the Mercantile Li
brary Auxiliary. The subject of both lectures
will be "Shakespeare," and the speakers will
be Charles Mills Gavley, professor of Knglish
llternture||in the University of California.
Berkeley, and Thomas Magee, president of the
Mercantile Library. â "â¦,
Tney will occupy forty-five minutes each.
Professor Gayley will treat the general subject
of Shakespeare as a comic dramatist, wnile
Mr. Magee will treat special points, such as
"How Can the Existence of a Great Genius Be
Explained?" , -Was Bacon Shakespeare?*' "Is
Shakespeare Greatest in the Theater or in the
Study?" "Shnke-ipeare's Language," "Brief
Studies in 'Hamlet,' 'Macbeth,' 'Romeo and
Juliet, the 'Midsummer Night's Dream' and
in the Sonnets."
In these two lectures in one evening Shake
speare will be presented from the view-point
of the college professor and the business man.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1897.
CASPAR FIRST IN
THE LISSAK STAKE
Scarf Pin, Not Up to a
Bruising Run, Beaten
Easily.
David Finally Got a Good Ride
and Won Handily From
Formal.
Chenille Distinguished Herself First
Time Oatâ Reddington Beaten Ont
by Go d Dnst.
A lair-sized crowd saw tbe Lisaak selling
stake for three-year-olds decided at Oak
land yesterday and were not aroused to
any very high pitch of enthusiasm, for
Caspar won in easy fashion. The distance
was six furlongs, and there were only
three other starters, Scarf Pin, Good
Times and St en tor. Caspar was a7to 10
favorite and with Thorpe in tbe saddle
was always in tbe lead and experienced
no difficulty in winning by a couple of
lengths in 1:15. Good Times with Sims
up looked to have secured the place by a
head, but it was given to tbe second choice,
Scarf Pin.
The balance of the sport was tame and
uneventful. Favorites succeeded in mak
ing a stand-oft of it, taking three of the
six events run.
Don ClarenclO was heralded as the good
thing for the opening five-furlong
scramble, and was sent to tue post a __ to 1
tavorue. Chenille, the second choice, led
from the jump, leading Nebula out two
lengths at the wire, with the favorite
fourth behind Mercutio.
The seven and a half furlong purse
event was easily captured by the 11 to 10
favorite David with Thorpe up. He took
the lead from Aiezzo down the back
stretch and with considerable in reserve
won easily from Formal, the second
choice.
The mile handicap went to the 7 to 10
favorite, Damien, with Willie Martin up,
though not without a struggle. The light
weighted Satsuma hooked up with the
first choice at the head oi the stretch, and
at one time looked a winner^ but Martin
rode Damien hard, and, shaking off Dr.
Roweli'a horse, passed the stand with
nearly a length oi daylight separating
himself from the outsider. McLight, of
whic much was expected, was a poor
third.
About the biggest upset of tbe day oc
curred in the mile selling affair. Bena
mela, with Sims in the saddle, was backed
down to 8 to 5 favoritism, but Willie took
the overland route and ended up iv third
place. Perseus; a 25 to 1 shot, ridden by
Bob Isom, won. Tne outsider cut out the
pace from the jump, and in a hard drive
finished two lengths in front of Torsino.
The mile and a sixteenth hurdle handi
cap was conceded to tbe favorite Ridding
ton belore the field went to the post, and
the Corrigan entry looked to have the race
in hand when Gold Dust, an attache ot
the Morgue, with a strong injection of
embalming fluid under bis bide, suddenly
came witb a rush, and taking the inside
position from the favorite, was tirst by a
length, Imp. Autonomy finished in tne
show.
NOTES.
When Don Clarencio finished third in a
race on Monday a protest was lodged
against the payment of the short end of
the purse to bis owners, on the ground
tbat tbe horse was ineligible to start in
the race- The protest was sustained and
third money given to Jack Richelieu.
This sort of errors should never occnr on
a first-class racecourse. The latter horse
was well played on that occasion to get
the show, and the public were the suffer
ers by the mistake. â¢
It must bave been exasperating to tbe
backers of Reddington to see a "lobster"
like Gold Dust suddenly blossom again
and beat their horse out. Gold Dust, his
owners, jockey, traps and all belongings
sbould be shipped C. 0. D. to the outlaw
Iron Hill track.
The judges were evidently in error when
they gave second place to Scarf Pin, for
Good Times was second by a good bead.
Not only was this clearly apparent from
the press and grand stands, but also from
the opposite side of the track according to
people standing on that side of the course.
The trainer of Scarf Pin had been una

NICORA GARCIA DEAD
The Old Woman Was Ac:red
ited With Having Lived
106 Years.
She Had Resided So Long in This
City That People Forgot Her
Ex:ct Age.
Mrs. Nicora Garcia, 90 years of age, died
suddenly in the City and County Hos
pital yesterday afternoon. The old woman
was accredited with having lived 106
years, but on investigation this proved to
be a fallacy. She had been suffering for
several months with general debility, and,
as proper care could not be given her in
her home, 536 Vallejo street, she was re
moved to the hospital.
A few days prior to her 'removal to the
City and County Hospital she was visited
by the Rev. Father James Validome. At
tbat time she did not appear seriously ill,
but later her ailment assumed a serious
aspect, and Father Validome was called to
administer tbe sacrament.
Tuesday evening she was removed to
the City and County Hospital, and yester
day afternoon she died. As the physician
did not snow the cause of death the case
was reported to the 'Coroner, but the body
was allowed to be removed to a downtown
undertaking establishment.
For the last ten years the deceased baa
relied for support upon the charity of tbe
church and a friend, Senora Dionisia Uri
oste. She bad two nephews, grown men,
who depended upon her for support,
and she allowed them sustenance from
the merger sums she received from chari
table institntions.
The funeral services will be held in tbe
Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe, but
when has not as yet been determined.
Reception tn Clerks and Salesmen.
A reception to clerks and salesmen will take
place at the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion, Mason and Ellis streets, this evening at 8
o'clock. There will be a musical and literary
programme in which the Columbian Orches
tra, Knickerbocker Quartet, Professor Louis
Crepaux, member of the Paris Grand Opera,
and Professor C. B. Newton will take part; also
an athletic exhibition in the gymnasium of
the building. The entire structure will be
thrown open to the young men representing
the different mercantile houses of this City.
There will be an appropriate address by Mayor
Phelan.
"Europe on Five Hundred Dollars."
On Friday evening Sam Booth will tell about
what he was able to see on a recent trip to
Europe for $500, for the benefit of the poor
fund of Trinity Presbyterian Church, corner
Capp and Twenty-third streets.
FARMERS ARE ALL
TOO INDIFFERENT
Professor Hilgard's Verdict
on Agricultural
Study.
Interesting Fapers Read Last
Night at the Farmers'
Institute.
Commissioner Manscn Speaks of the
Value of Good Roads for Farm
ing Districts.
The first session of the Farmers' Insti
tute was held last night in Academy of
Sciences Hall. There was a fair attend
ance not only of educationalists, but also
of business men and of ladies.
A. S. Hallidie acted as the chairman of
the evening. He made a few introductory
PROFESSOR HILGARD Explains Why Farmers Should Induce
Their Sons to Take a Course in the College of Agriculture.
*--7*T. v ''. "rt" â :.''â¢ :.'.â ' '.. - . rt-':.-.
[ remarks outlining the purpose of the in
' stitute, md stated that the Board of Re
gents of the State University, of which he
is a member, determined to carry out
a member, had de'.ernnne.l to carry out
tbe spirit of the law under which that in
stitution was founded. Professor E. W.
Hilgard, the head of the department of
agriculture, was then introduced as the
first speaker of the evening.
As Professor Hilgard came forward he
I bowed his acknowledgment of the ap
! plause and launched forth on his subject
; without more ado. His remarks were
j introduced with a statement that the gen-
I eral subject of agriculture at the univer
sity is i rented in two ways â by instruc
tion and by experimentation.
"The methods of instruction, " he
stated, "are by delivering lectures at the
university, by these farmers' institutes,
.. by an extended correspondence, and by
: reports and bulletins scattered all over
I the State at regular intervals.
"We try to make boys work as they do
on the. farm. This has been tried in the
old countries and pronounced a success,
but it has been said that in America,
where every boy hones to become Presi
dent, it could not amount to much.
I Purely, as regards instruction,' we have
found it to be an excellent method.
"Here in California we have problems
to consider foreign to most countries. In
such arid â  countries as Arabia and all
those lands where civilization first de
veloped they have had long experience
and know just what to grow, where and
when to grow it. For this reason we need
to teach our boys to consider the condi
tions with which they are surrounded.
"To be taught the boys must have
teachers. There is not one out of fifty
competent to deal with the subject of
agriculture. Neither can the masses at
tend the university nor the university go
round on wheels to supply the people with
knowledge.
"The Farmers' Institute is the nearest
approach to enlightening the masses we
have yet thought ot. You would be sur
prised at the lack of interest the farmers
of this State seem to take in the general
! subject of agricultural teaching. Out of
500 students tbat entered the university
last year eighty-five or ninety were farm
ers' sons. Yet not a single one of those
boys from the rural districts took the agri
cultural course, even as special students.
Only five took the course at all, and they
were all city boys.
"There is" a reason for this. Farm work
is largely regarded as menial drudgery,
and the boys long for metropolitan ex
istence, where they can make money with
out hard work. Ip this they are largely
encouraged by their parents. Now, tbis
is a mistake; if those boys were taught
tbat agriculture requires intellectuality
as well as muscle to be carried on prop
erly they might take more interest in it/
"As regards the second method of in
struction, or the work of the farmers' in
stitutes, it is only in its inception, but we
are meeting with great encouragement
and believe that we sball accomplish good
results.
"In correspondence we are frequently
expected to tell what a certain tract ofland
is good for, how it can be improved, and
a thousand other things merely by hav
ing a sample of the soil sent us. We can
not know how to estimate anything at
all or give any advice on such meager in
formation. In some places they have to
keep at work teaching people to fertilize
the â here we are frequently obliged to .
inculcate tbe principle that there are
other things than fertilization.
â¢'The experimental work is largely ham
pered by the introduction of these vexa
tions problems. Besides the station at
Berkeley, which is the center and does the
experimental work, we have what we call
four culture stations, located respectively
in Amador, Tulare, San .Luis Obispo and
in Southern California.
"This experimental work saves the
farmer a great deal of labor and coÃtly
attempts at growing certain products un
suitable on account of the climate and
soil. It is all nonsense to suppose that
anything can be grown anywhere. It can
not be done. Certain grapes cannot be
grown in the northern part of the State
that can in tho southern, and vice versa.
"The experiment stations try to elucidate
these problems as well as possible, and I
think we have largely succeeded. We
now produce most excellent wine in this
State, because we have learned what sec
tions are suited to the various varieties of
grapes.
"We frequently discover things that
surprise us. For instance, it was formerly
thought that alkali soil was poor land in
which to raise sugar-beets, but here in
this Stateâ at Cbino, to be more exact â we
have found that the best sugar-beet on
earth can be grown in alkali soil. Tens
vast areas of land in California hitherto
considered useless can now be utilized
with rich profit." _rt .:_,
Professor Hilgard devoted a good deal of
time to a discussion of the subject of fer
tilization. He claimed that it was useless
to spend too much time in studying that
subject in California, as only a pure, virgin
soil is found here. At the conclusion of
his address Chairman Hallidie took oc
casion to remark that the suoject Profes
sor Hilgard had treated on needed more
time for even a fair elucidation, and that
more would be beard on it at other insti
tutes. He then introduced Marsden Man
son, Ph.D., State Highway Com
missioner, who discussed the theme of the
"Interest of Municipalities in Good Roads
for Farming Districts." â â â .â¦,; ;'.â 
"Cafifornia is such a country," he said,
"that if it were laid out on the Atlantic
seaboard it would extend from Cape Cod
to Charleston. If laid out on the Euro
pean feaboard it would extend from the
northern line bf Portugal through the
Straits of Gibraltar and several hundred
miles into Africa. And yet in both of
those regions the land is not more diversi
fied than rignt here in this State.
"This shows how much there is to be
considered on the subject of roads for
California. As the country is diversified
so are the roads to be found in it. First,
there are the State roads, those used in
passing from points in one county through
several others to some central point such
as San Francisco. Then the come the
county roads â those used chiefly for reach
ing the county seat. Lastly come the
'feeder?,' or neighborhood roads, which
are always built last. In devising methods
of improving the roadways of the State
we havo been forced to consider all these
classifications. ::.".â¢_?
"The first thing civilized man does
after building himself a home is to con
struct roadways leading to and from it.
The United States has just passed through
one of those peculiar waves of advance
ment known as 'railroad fever.' We
have progressed further than any other
nation in the building of railroads but
have fallen behind in the proper construc
tion of public highways."
Commissioner M&nson then disserted on
the evils attendant upon letting the con
struction and maintenance of the public
roads get into politics. Many examples
of the wasting of public funds in building
poor roads were given in conclusion in
the form of stereopticon views. Illustra
tions were also given of many old high
ways constructed in the most approved
style. .-..â .â¢â â _',-.â 
FUNERAL OP FRANK HUME.
Remains of the Young Man to Be Cre
mated To-Day.
The funeral of Frank G. Hume, who i
died near Los Gatos last Monday, will Le !
held to-day from the residence of his par- I
ents, Mr. and Mrs. George W. Hume, in j
Piedmont Services will begin at 11 a. m.
and thereafter the remains will be brought
to the Odd Fellows' crematory in this City.
According to the known, wishes of the
young man and his bereaved family the
funeral will be private and the services
entirely simple. The following close
friends of tbe deceased in life will act as !
pallbearers: J. Latbrop, George Green
wood, A. Farwell, A. ______ Pope, Edward
Belcher and George L. Woolrich.
One of the sad features in connection
with Mr. Hume's death is tbe absence of
bis brother Will, who is at present at sea
on board one of his father's ships between
Australia and this port. He will be over
whelmed upon arriving to learn of â  the j
totally unlooked for misfortune which has |
visited his family.
Architects to Meet.
A meeting of the Chapter of Architects will
be held at their room California street, to- ',
morrow at 3 p. m. when a paper will be read by j
O. Alexander Wright, entitled "Bills of Quan
tities and Their Relation to Contracts."
SAY THE CONTRACT
IS A FORGERY
Experts Explode a Bcmb
in the Quackenbush
Case.
Car ho and Ames Dec' are a
Signature Genuine, but the
Text Spurious.
Ida B?nson and a Former Husband of
the Plaintiff Called to th_
Stand Yesteray.
If expert testimony eoes for anything,
then the defense in the case of Quacken
bush against Quackenbush scored a strong
point yesterday in Â» attempting to dis
credit the alleged marriage contract be
tween Mrs. Nancy Abbott-Quackenbusb.
and the defendant, dated November 15,
1889.
The evidence adduced yesterday was in
the shape of written depositions by the
well-known writing experts, David N.
Carvalhcyajid Daniel T. Ames, who were
brought from New York to serve in the
Fair will contest. The alleged marriage
contract, upon which the plaintiff mainly
bases her claim to be the wile of the mil
lionaire defendant, was carefully examined
by the two experts in question, and their
conclusions were expressed in unmistak
able language in the depositions react yes
terday.
It is clear, they state, that the signature
of the defendant is genuine enough, but
that the original writing above the signa
ture was evidently effaced by means of
some chemical application. The lan
guage of the alleged contract was then
substituted, and the name of the plaintiff
written beneath that of the defendant.
Both the words of the alleged contract
and the plaintiff's signature are admit
tedly in the latter's handwriting. The
chemicals, the experts go on to say, re
moved the size and calendaring from that
portion of the paper to which they were
applied, witb tbe result that the ink ran
in many places as v would on a piece ot
ordinary blotting-paper. In order to make
the plaintiff's signature correspond as
closely as possible with the handwriting
on the chemically treated portion of the
paper, the edges of the two b's in the word
Abbott â the experts contend â were in
tentionally blurred along the edge-", but
with such remarkable regularity that the
fraud is apparent. Yet another proof
adduced is that the paper was obviously
folded long before the plaintiff, Mrs.
Abbott, wrote upon it, the old fold ap
pearing a quarter of an inch above the
new, while the ink haÂ« spread a little
above and below the old fold.
The defense subsequently called two
important witnesses to the stand in the
persons of a Miss Ida Benson and Mrs.
Abbott's former husband, William Abbott
of Tacoma. The former gave evidence
which directly contradicted Mrs. Abbott's
assertion that immediately after the sign
ing of the marriage contract she went to
live with Quackenbush as his wife. Miss
Benson stated that for six months after
the date of the alleged contract â is to
say, from November 15 to April, â sho
lived and slept with Mrs. Abbott and that
during this period Quackenbush paid bis
rent like an ordinary boarder.
William Abbott, the other witness, was
relied on by the defense as a gentleman
who "could a tale unfold," but unfortu
nately for the realization of that pleasur
able hope every question involving a ma
terial issue was summarily ruled out.
THE BELLE NAVA CASE.
_
Another Witness Bribery Charge la
Brought Against; Harry Taylor.
A second charge of attempt to bribe a
witness has been booked against Harry
Taylor at the City Prison.
Taylor is a friend of James Wilson and
Ellis Swain, the men who are accused of
having assaulted Belle Nava some weeks
ago.
The first complaint against Taylor was
not drawn up properly, and the case
against him was dismissed yesterday
morning in Judge Joachimsen's court.
Another complaint was drawn up, hew
ever, with E. 0. Dea as complainant, and
Taylor was again thrown in jail. He was
subsequently reieaseu on $1000 bonds.
Taylor is accused of offering E. O. Dea
money and other valuable considerations
if he could cause Belle Nava to not testify
against the prisoners.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
THE FAKE AM) THE FACT.
THE ir_A.B_:___D
The Examiner published for several days at the
top of Its title page the following fake:
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
249,757 Inches
Of Ads During 1896.
5964 More
Than were published by any-
other San Francisco newspaper.
Xn the publication of this fake the Examiner
was probably not aware that a careful record was
being kept of the actual amount in inches of its
advertising and that in consequence lt could be
confronted with the following fact.
â THE FACT â
THE EXAMINER PUBLISHED
236,528 Inches
Of Ads During J 896.
That is one fact and here is an-
other :
THE CALL PUBLISHED
239,551 Inches
Of Ads During i 896.
3,023 More
Inches were published in
THE CALL than in the
Examiner during J 896.
It Is to be remembered that during 1893 the
Examiner published approximately 800 inches of
illegal lottery advertisements, or wnich The Call
did not and would not publish one.
he monarch of the faicers has doubtless suc-
ceeded in securing thousands of Inches of adver-
tising during the past year by duping and deceiv-
ing advertisers through falsa and arrogant asser-
tions of the character of the foregoing fake. It
would seem, however, from the facts that the
merchants a3 a rule have not been misled by Its
fraudulent pretenses.
The Examiner boasts that Its books are open to
Inspection, but we suggest that it Inspect Its own
books before It venture} UDon the publication of
another fake.
We congratulate the public on the fact that the
exposure of this fake led the Examiner to drop It.
In this the Examiner was discreet, and if lt ls wise
It will make no more such bold attempts to
deceive the public.

WATER RATES.
The investigation begun yesterday into the affairs of the water company by
the Board of Supervisors promises to yield results from which the public can form
a fair estimate of the rate of charges which should be iixed for the consumers of
water during the fiscal year. This promise is gratifying to the public, for lt is exactly
what has long been desired. The people have no wish to do injustice to those who
have invested their capital in the company, but they are determined that full justice
sliail be done to themselves and to the municipality.
The Call from the beginning of the controversy has consistently advocated
the course which the Supervisors are now pursuing. It has called for a full,
thorough and exhaustive investigation of the expenditures and income of tbe com
pany in order that the people might have all the facts necessary upon which to
base a just judgment of what should be done in the premises. The investigation
cannot be made in a day. It will require time and careful study to arrive at the
facts and to draw rightful conclusions from them. The Supervisors are acting
rightly, therefore, in proceeding carefully about the work. There is no occasion for
hurry, and while unnecessary delays should he avoided, ample time should be given
to the subject to obtain the fullest information possible concerning it.
It is gratifying to note that public opinion has made itself so clearly known on
this subject that even those who were at one time demanding arbitrary reductions
have been forced to abandon their cry and are now giving at least a seeming consent
to the course the Supervisors have taken and which The Call has all along advocated.
The subject is at present the one of greatest municipal interest now before the
people. So long as the hearings are continued they will attract the attention of every
intelligent citizen. It will be no slight and casual notice given to the reports made of
the various hearings. Each will be closely studied by thousands of observant and
reflecting men and women, and as a result there will be formed a resolute and definite
public sentiment on the question. To that sentiment it will be well for the Supervisors
to give close heed.
The people believe they have been compelled to pay higher water rates than justice
requires, and if the facts brought out by the investigation prove that belief to be well
founded they will expect the Supervisors to provide lower rales for the future. ' It
must not be supposed that opposition to aibitrary reduction means popular consent
to the existing rates. Good citizens ast for justice and are determined to have it
GOOD ROADS.
While the people of California are not
prejudiced in favor of any particular
method of dealing with the subject of
road improvement on the part of the
State, they are most earnestly in favor of
some law which will promote that much
desired object. Whether the work is to
be done by a State commission or by
Supervisors it ought certainly to be done
by somebody, and the present Legislature
will be regarded as negligent of its duty
if it does not provide some means for fur
nishing the people with better highways
than they have at present.
Whether the work can be best done by
a State commission or Supervisors is ques
tionable. Mr. Ennis of Sacramento stated
in a discussion before the Assembly Com
mittee on Roads and Highways on Tues
day that he was opposed to Supervisors
building the roads, and cited as an argu
ment in favor of his position that the
Supervisors in Sacramento County had
spent $50,000 on roads and had not a de
cent highway in the county. The repre
sentatives of Santa Clara County could
effectually answer that argument by
showing the Legislature what has been
done by Supervisors in constructing ana
maintaining the highways of Santa Clara.
Mr. Price of Sonoma ' objected to the
highway commission on the geueral
ground that the people are tired of creat
ing commissions to dip their hands into
the public purse. To this argument a
valid answer might also be found in the
fact that the people are opposed to no
commission which by rendering good
work proves itself to be of economic value
to the community.
The Call takes no sides on the question
of county or State supervision, it speaks
for all in demanding merely that some
legislation be devised for the prompt be
ginning of highway improvement. A
beginning is all that is necessary. As soon
as the work is begun it will justify itself
and find favor among the people.
The truth of this statement is attested
by the experience in those States where
the worn: of highway improvement has
been most effectively carried on. The ex
ample of Massachusetts has been so often
quoted that it is hardly necessary to refer
to it again. A new illustration is fur
nished by New Jersey, where the work of
highway improvement was becun about
six years ago, and has since progressed
with remarkable success.
When the New Jersey commission be
gan its work there was some objection
from the farmers on account of increased
taxation, but now the roads have proven
themselves of such economic value to
farms the people are so eager to obtain
good roads that the fear is they will make
greater demands upon tbe State than the
State can well afford to support.
The experience in New Jersey and Mas
sachusetts would undoubtedly be repeated
in California if the work of highway im
provement were bepun here with anything
like the vigor with which it has been un
dertaken in those commonwealths. The
main thing is to make a beginning, and it
is to be hoped that the Legislature will
devise some means of doing that during
the present session.
CHECKING THE BANDITS.
The courage of Express Messenger Alex
ander Summers not only prevented the
robbery of the Santa Fe overland train in
Arizona on Monday night, but put an end
to the life of the leader of the gang.
Rarely has a shot been more effectually
tired tban that which killed the bandit
who carried the dynamite with which it
was intended to blow open the safe of the
express-car and postoffice-car. If a few
more such feats are performed the trade of
holding up trains will be rendered so haz
ardous that it will cease to attract the
minds of adventurous villains.
The feat of the express messenger was
one of more tban ordinary daring. He
bad to get out of a car in a train which
had been held up and make his way to a
position where he could get a sure shot at
the robber. To effect this he was com
pelled to crawl under the car and get on
the brakebeam, and from that place draw
himself up to a place where he could take
good aim with his revolver, .and after
making sure that he had the right man
kill him with one shot.
Too much praise cannot be given to
Messenger Summers for the service which
by his valor he has rendered not only to
the express company but to the public
generally. He has done much to put an
end to train-robbing, and If bis example
is followed by others the time will not be
far distant when travel on the railway
trains of the United States will be safe
from any danger of molestation by any
gang of bandits however reckless and bold
they may be.
Commenting on the so-called news re
ports of the New York Journal the Chap
Book says it "is always vulgar, trivial, sen
sational and, as a minor detail, false." It
seems, therefore, that Hearst varies his
New York depravities from his San Fran
cisco Indecencies, for with the Examiner
the falseness of the news reports is a major
detail. .
The fact that a Vanderbilt is to spend
the winter in Washington has raised a
flutter all over the East, and prophecies
are freely made that before long Washing
ton will be the social center of the Re
public and New York will have to con
tent herself with being a business town.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1897.
PLATT AND THE TARIFF.
The Democratic organs, in default of
something better to do. have revived their
old story that Senator Piatt of New York
will be an antagonist of the McKinley ad
ministration. This time they have com
mitted the blunder of going into detail, and
the Examiner correspondent from Wash
ington yesterday was foolish enough to
say that Mr. Piatt and his friends in the
Senate "will hold up the new tariff bill
until McKinley satisfies their demands in
the way of patronage."
A sufficient answer to this reckless as
sertion is to be found in the address made
by Senator Piatt at the banquet recently
given to him at Albany. In his speech
the Senator-elect referred to the tariff
question, and in the course of his remarks
said:
The people do not want the Wilson bill
patched up. They want It repealed, and in its
place their plain demand, to which the elec
tion of two successive Republican majorities
in the House of Representatives sufficiently
testifies, is for the enactment of an intelligent
and consistent tariff, based in every schedule
upon the principle of preventing the foreign
producer of goods which compete with Ameri
can goods Irom wholesaling his wares in the
American market at prices which compel the
American maker of such wares either to go
out of business or to reduce the wages he pays
to his labor.
Several times in the course of his speech
the Senator-elect referred to the import
ance of Republican harmony in Congress.
He gave distinct pledges that he would
support the administration and would
do all in his power to further the speedy
enactment of a tariff bill thoroughly em
bodying the system of protection. In
express terms he declared that the suc
cess of the McKinley administration will
be the success of the Republican party,
and tbat no contribution he can make to
that great cause will be wanting.
The Senator from New York has his
faults, but a lack of loyalty to his party
and the welfare of the country is not one
of them. Democrats who are hoping to
see divisions, dissensions and antag
onisms in the Republican ranks will have
to look to some one else than Senator
Piatt to lead in making them. It hardly
needed his declaration of loyalty to as
sure the people that he would be found
actively co-operating with the adminis
tration, but since the Democratic organs
have, started these fakes charging him
with disloyalty it seems that his speech
was timely.
BISMAEOK'S BLUES.
From the report of a fragment of con
versation with the great Bismarck in his
retirement we learn that the Iron Chan
cellor is sometimes weary of his life. No
longer allowed to play the part of a star
performer on the stage of the world's
great affairs he says he is tired of being a
mere spectator. The pathetic plaint will
probably touch a sympathetic chord in
the hearts of many strong men who have
been laid away on the shelf as back num
bers. To be deemed useless is bitter to
any one, but must be doubly bitter to one
conscious of fettered strength. Prome
theus, bound with silken cords of the
smoothest courtesy to live in the limits
of a palace which is not a seat of power,
will have bis vitals preyed upon by eagles
invisible to men who are not Titans.
It is a question whether fretting over
loss of power is not inconsistent with a
character truly great. Ambition, courage
and wisdom may all be present in extra
ordinary development, and yet there may
be lacking an important complement to
the filling out of a well-rounded character.
An ideal life for an ideal man would be a
passage through three clearly divided
periodsâ a period of youth, with glowing
hopes and aspirations; a period of man
hood's prime, full of strenuous effort, re
warded with accomplished ambition, and
then should follow many years of serene
and quiescent contemplation, with rest so
absolute as to be unbroken even by a de
sire to again enter the arena of active life.
Men who have lived such lives are
known to have asserted that the last
period contained a happiness far beyond
youth's glowing hopes, and superior even
to that resulting from the triumphs of
manhood. Such a life is indeed one to be
desired, and that a man who has attained
two-thirds of it should by his own restless
impatience lose the culminating bliss of a
peaceful old age is one of the saddest
thwartings of nature's plans.
It should be a source of gratification to
Bismarck that since death is inevitable he
is allowed to linger long enough to see
that the empire he created can progress
smoothly without his aid. It should
be a pleasure to him to watch the unfold
ing of German development even as a
spectator, who can no longer participate
in the great work of directing it He
should ask himself, like Tennyson:
Were this not well, to bide mine hour,
Tho* watching from a ruined tower
How grows the day of human power?
The House of Representatives showed
itself on Tuesday to be as eager as the
Senate to knock Cleveland's vetoes sky
high, and it would seem the President
mignt as well go fishing and let Congress
attend to legislation without obstruction
on his part.
It was noted in both _ New York and
Chicago that during the cold snap the
weather was so severe some of the richest
and best-housed people in tbe city could
not thaw out enough to subscribe to the
relief fund for the poor.
THROUGH A GIANT EYE OF SCIENCE.
The close of the present century bids fair to substantiate the claims which have been put
lor ward by many enthusiasts that it would mark a great era of discoveries in the field of science.
So often are announcements now made of new processes and applications of natural
resources, of better understanding of natural laws and discoveries of nature's secrets that
astonishment is almost supplanted by bewilderment.
Of the discoveries and Inventions that have benefited mankind, more than one-half of the
total have been made known to tho world during the past twenty-five years.
The marvelous operation of the telephone is
no longer mysterious, and yet lv discovery
only attains its legal majority of twenty-one
R years ln 1897.
In nearly all of the discoveries of the last
quarter of a century electricity has played
some important part.
Next to electricity light forms one of the
prominent constituents of the new discoveries.
And one of the applications of light, that of
photography, has added to astrouomical
science the most powerful ally it possesses.

McLean, "and none of consequence lately.
The rain carried off what there was.
"Altogether it has been a rather open and
pleasant winter, and mining has gone forward
without any interruption."
Mr. McLean ssys there is a general interest
in the mines of Nevada County, as manifested
by men from elsewhere who have gone there
to investigate the mineral resources. He will
remain here probably for some little time.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
An opera which many people think will
mark a new era in lyric drama will receive Its
first public performance to-morrow night,
February 12, at the Paris urand Opera. It is
by Zola and Bruneau, the authors of "Le
Reve" and "l'Altaque Moulin." the latter
of which tells so realistically of the horrors of
war. "Messidor," the new work, deals with
the labor problem. Bruneau always warned
another libretto from Zola after the success of
"l'Attaque dv Moulin," but Zola insisted that
musicians should write their own librettos.
He said: "In modern lyric drama the com
munion must be perfect between words and
poem. Bruneau writes well; he has ideas.
What more does he want ?" But the composer
still clamored for a libretto. "I cannot write
poetry," said Zola; "do you think you can do
ALFRED BRUNEAU, Who Has Collaborated With Zola in the
Latest Development of Lyric Drama*
without it?" "Perfectly," said _Bruneau; "I
shall be more un trammeled with a libretto in
prose." So that question being resolved there
remained the choice of subject. One day Zola
said to Bruneau: "I have an idea; it may not
be musical, but it is great and can be de
veloped in a thrilling manner. My subject is
Toil.'" "I see a very fertile subject|in that,"
said Bruneau. "Everything depends on the
development,"
When Zola first sat down to pen the libretto
of the new opera, "Messidor," he took a sheet
of paper and noted on it what he considered
the absolute essentials of success. He wrote,
"The plot must lend Itself to picturesque stag
ing and fine scenery. The drama must end
welt, unlike the ordinary operas, which gen
erally terminate with the death of the hero,
this shall end In the trlumphof life. There
must be choruses, or rather crowds, alive,
agitated crowds, in which each individual
plays a part and participates in the general
action. The drama must be modern, tut it
must contain also a legendary side, where
naivete and faith must be shown." And then
Zola mused: "Who shall be the characters of
this drama? No banal Prince,' no faded
Queen, no bourgeoisâ tbey are bo unplctur
esque. Who then? Workmen," and thus the
horny-handed sons of toil are the heroes of
the newest lyric drama.
The plot of "Messidor" is something as fol
lows: There is a village whose inhabitants
have always lived by collecting gold washed
down by the happy waves of the river Ariege.
One day a i illager, more enterprising and In
telligent than the others, constructs a mill on
the river bank, and turning the water from its
course robs his fellow-townsmen of all the
gold. At one blow the village is ruined and
Its inhabitants reduced to want. But
from the neighboring city comes a native of
the village who has learned many things In
his travels. Ho tells his friends that they have

The "Marseillaise" has already celebrated
its centenary, although its periods of service
as the French national hymn have never been
very long, for Napoleon I, the restoration and
the second empire all in turn shelved it. On
the 28th of last month Austria celebrated the
centenary of its national hymn, for it was on
January 28, 1797, that Emperor Francis de
creed that the hymn written by Joseph
Haydn to words by the Jesuit father, Laurent
Leopold Haschka, should henceforth be sung
as the national hymn of the Austrian*. Two
weeks after, February 12, on the Emperor's
birthday, this hymn, which begins "God pre
serve the Emperor Francis," was sung pub
licly In all the theaters in Vienna, and Joseph
Haydn was presented with a fine portrait of
the Emperor and a good round sum of money.
The autograph copy of his composition is still
preserved in the Imperial Library at Vienna.
Haydn's composition has never ceased to be
the Austrian national hymn, though when the
Emperor Ferdinand came to the throne, on
account of the name being two syllables
longer than Francis (Franz), "Our Emperor"
was substituted, and fitted the music exactly.
The European papers are going into raptures
over the singing of Miss Fanny Mlchelsen (Mile
Francisca) of this City, who is appearing at
Monte Carlo with a grand opera company
which Includes Adellna Patti among Us mem
bers. lie Figaro of Paris says: "At tho last
classical concert at Monte Carlo there was re
vealed a young can tatrlce of marvelous voice,
Mile. Francisca, who sang with infinite art
and very profound feeling an aria from
â¢Hamlet' which brought her a colossal success.
It will be but a short time before this young
artiste is counted among our leading canta
trices." Miss Mlchelsen ls fulfilling her first
professional engagement at Monte Carlo. She
took her norn de theatre from her native city.
A new musical and dramatic departure has
been Inaugurated in Paris in the opening of a
little theater known as "Les Treteaux de la
Basoche," which is an exact reproduction of
medieval theaters, and where plays and music
of the middle ages are given. As its name,
"Les Treteaux" (trestles), implies, the stage Is
made of boards laid on trestles, and what
scenery and properties there are consist of
exact reproductions of those which, according
to the documents of the times, were used by
medieval players. The representations have
begun with two semi-mystic works, "The Wed
ding of St. Francis", and "The Other Soul."
Both are accompanied by a chorus which
sings ancient music. .'â -"
The Grand Theater at Gand recently gave
the first performance of a new opera by two
Belgian writers, "The Bride of Abydos," which
was enthusiastically received by the public.
The libretto was arranged by a Belgian pro
fessor, M. PieterÂ«, and the music was written
by a young composer named Lebrun, who
some years ago won the prix de Rome.
A new departure in concert work has been
inaugurated by a Greek singer named Aramis,
who ls creating a furor in England. He sings
the popular melodies of the Orient, some of
which are of great antiquity. They have been
harmonized for modern accompaniments by
Bourgault Ducondray. The critics say that
an impression of entire novelty Is conveyed
by this genre of music, and that the applica
tion of modern harmony to antiquo melody is
an idea which will no doubt be more devel
oped henceforth, as Aramis has proved how
successful such music can be in pleasing the
public.
During the year 1896 the British Museum of
London received an addition of 1391 books on
music and 4793 scores and manuscript music
of different kinds. Many of these books and
scores were presented to the museum and
some of them are of enormous value, such as
some pencil sketches by Beethoven for hid
compositions during 1825 and 1526, a book of
hymns written in France curing the twelfth
eentnry and the only copy known to exist of
the second book of madrigals by Paul Isnardl
(Venice, 1577).
A new idea has been Introduced Into the
theater hat discussion by the supervisors of
Brussels. These authorities have passed an
ordinance prohibiting the wearing of any but
flat hats in the theaters, but they have ex
cepted two theaters â the Alcazar and the Vau
deville, where smoking is allowed. The con
tention of the gallant Belgian supervisors is
that where men have a right to annoy women
by smoking, women have a right to annoy
men by wearing big theater hats.
The sixtieth anniversary of Queen Vic
toria's accession to the throne has produced a
special sort of musical literature. A number
of bishops, canons and other dignitaries of
the Established Church have written Hymns
to celebrate the event and well-known organ
ists, such as Dr. Parratt, Dr. Bridge and Dr.
Martin, have set them to music. These hymns
have all been gathered into one edition and
Queen Victoria has accepted the dedication
of the work.

GEETING A JURY IN ARKANSAS.
Washington Post.
"In some sections of Arkansas," said one of
the Representatives from that State yester
day, "people have a very strong objection to
serving on juries. When I was at home last
fall I heard a little story in that regard. A
certain Judge in one of the rural districts
having occasion to try an important case
ordered the Sheriff to impanel a jury. When
two days had passed and no return had been
made, he sent for the Sheriff, and demanded
to know why his orders bad not been obeyed.
"Wall, Jedge," said the Sheriff, "I've got
jest ten of 'em locked up in the jail yere. and
I turned out the dogs this mornin' arter the
other two." _ -:â â â '. â  r- â .- ~- â¢-_
ONE THING CERTAIN.
The Voice.
Men may question the authenticity of this or
that book in the Bible; they may flout the
story of Jonah and the whale; they may evade
questions of faith and doctrine; they may re
fuse assent to the Gospel narratives; they may
hide themselves in metaphysical mazes until
the existence of God becomes uncertain to
them. But there is one thing that cannot be
questioned, or flouted, or evaded, or hidden
from. There are no metaphysical subtleties
that can hide a man from death.

The new steamer Coquille River is now
receiving the finishing touches at Folsom
street wharf, and will be ready for her

should prove to be not only a good Sea
boat, but a splendid carrier. The comfort
of passengers has been well looked out

of the vessel have already been published

In publishing an account of the robbery

miserable by constant inquiries as to bis
losses and how be managed to reach home

Weitkanet is still in hopes of recovering
some of bis stolen property as the police

The hay wharf at the loot of Third
street was on fire again early yesterday
morninf. Coaloil had been stolen from

dock and poured over the hay. When

peddlers appeared on tbe scene anxious to
purchase the damaged fodder. A dozen
alarms have been turned in from the hay
wharf during the past six months, and in
every case incendiarism lias been sus
pected. Tbe officers of the Fire Depart
ment and Chief "Wharfinger Root are now
confident that ail the fires have been de
liberate attempts to destroy the wharf and
the hay stored on it.
Oscar Christensen, a sailor on the C. D.
Bryant, had an experience yesterday that
he will jot want to duplicate in a hurry.
He was ordered by Captain Lee to take
out the ship's stores, and while laden
down with half a sheep, several porter
house steaks and a sack of onions, be at
tempted to step into the ship's boat. He
made a misstep and all the provisions
went into the bay. car at once pulled
off his coat and vest and dived down after
the mutton and beef. He failed to re
cover either and then spent fifteen or
twenty minutes in swimming around
picking up tbo onions that came lo the
surface. Finally bo gave up the bunt and
rowed out to the vessel and changed his
clothes. He then pulled back to Folsom
street wharf to await the arrival of Cap
tain Lee. As Christensen has his pay for
the round trip coming to him the chances
are tnat be will find tbe value of the lost
goods stepped out of his bill.
The American ship Sterling, which ar
rived on the 3J inst. from Newcastle,
N. S. W., has as her chief officer Captain
Sterling, late of the American snip
Patrician. The latter vessel went down in
one of the worst gales over experienced on
the Australian coast, and had it not been
for the gallantry of the crew of the Brit
ish steamer Fifeshire every soul on board
would have perished.
"The Patrician sailed from Newcastle
for Lyttleton, N. Z., witb a cargo of coal,
and when 400 miles east of the Australian
coast we encountered a terrific gale," said
Captain Sterling yesterday. "Two of the
men were washed overboard, and after
forty-two hours of buffeting the vessel
began to settle. Then 1 ordered the top
masts cut away, and in their fall they
stove in the boats. That night I came to
the conclusion that our case was hopeless
and I wrote down the particulars of the
disaster, placed it in a bottle and threw it
overboard. Next morning the Fifeshire
hove in sight and came to our assistance.
The first boat that was lowered was stove
in and Chief Officer Ross was injured.
Notwithstanding bis injuries be insisted
on taking command of tbe second boat
that was launched.
"One may imagine the sea that was run
ning, when at limes tho hull of the Fife
shire, as seen fcom the wreck, would en
tirely disappear in the trough of the sea.
Tnis may convey to the mind tne magni
tude of the undertaking, and I must say
bad it not been for the great bravery and
heroism displayed by the crew of the' Fife
shire and the risks they ran, being willing
to sacrifice both life and limb, we would
certainly have perished, lor it was solely
due to their wonderful courage and per
severance and the skillful manner in which
Mr. Ross and his crew handled the boat
that they reached tbe wreck, as it was _>.
most dangerous and difficult task. Had
it not been for Captain Wilson, who
handled his ship in such a masterful and
seamanship-like manner, thus rendering
valuable assistance to the lifeboat, all
efforts would have proved fruitless, as the
Fifeshire Is a very large ship, and having
a heavy gale and high sea to contend with
it was extremely difficult to keep her in
position. Captain Wilson and his crew
are a credit to the Shire line and an honor
to the British flag tinder which they sail."
The brig Percy Ed wards is on the dry
dock receiving a thorough overhauling.

Recent advices from Valparaiso. Chile,
tell of a remarkable trip of the big Ger
man ship Potosi from Hamburg to the
port first mentioned.
The Potosi is one of the largest sailing
vessels afloat, being a five-master of over
5000 tons and with a record for speed sel
dom if ever excelled by a "wind-jammer."
She left Hamburg on November 17 last
and arrived in the Chilean port on Janu
ary 14, beating the best previous record
by two days. At times during the trip
she logged 16}Â£ knotsâ remarkable time
for a sailing vessel and a record not often
excelled by steamers. Her average speed
during the entire voyage was six knots
and a fraction. -'?
Captain Hilgendorf, who commands the
Potosi, has made a wonderful -record.
Five years ago he capsized the German
ship Parsifal, in which he had made sev
eral fast voyages from _, Hamburg to the
nitrate ports. All on board were saved.
Though no particular blame attached to
the skipper he was given a shin that was
considered about the slowest of the Ham
burg fleet as a sort of penance.
To the surprise of the owners he beat
out a number of crack ships and repeated
the operation on 1 the run home. Then he
was put on the Potosi, with the result
mentioned.

His Rcom Into Pure
Air.
Vows He Will Make a G ;od Jjb of It
Next Timeâ While at Hamburg
His Brother Di.d.
Colonel J. D. Young, proprietor of the
Russ House, bad a curious experience
Tuesday night with a man who was try
ing his best to end bis life, and failing
had notcing but regrets to express.
Along early in the evening a man about
45 years of age, of ordinary size and ap
pearance, with a lightish gray beard and
dark mustache, came un the stairway and
registered. He wrote his name as James
O. Egan, with something following which
looked like "Sb.Wossa," indicating, as It
seemed, a ship by the name of Wossa, and
asked for a room. It was at once given
him, and the man retired.
A' short time afterward tbe attaches of
the hotel detected a strong smell of pas
and a rigid examination - was made,
resulting in finding that the gas came
from Egan's room. The door was burst
open and the gas was found streaming
from tbe jets.
Egan was nearly unconscious, but tie
was dragged forth into the open air. He
seemed to have been drinking some, and
it was supposed that the gas had been
turned on accidentally. As he eventually
recovered he was;put back Into . the room
and left alone.
- Some time later, or about 10 o'clock,
there was another and stronger smell of
gas. The hotel force ran np to his room
and burst open the door again. Every jet
was turned on, and Egan lay on tbe bed
with his mouth open and apparently near
death.
He was dragged out once more and this
THE OLD FIRE CHIEF IN BRONZE.
The late David Bcannell, Chief of the Fire Department, by the terms of his
will requested that his helmet, trumpet/belt, swords and medals should be taken
possession of by the Fire Commissioners and kept In the board room. A cabinet
with marble pillars was erected in the center of the board room and the relics
were reverently placed in it where they conld be seen by everybody. - Something
was lacking, and the San Francisco Fire Department Charitable Fund Association
decided eight months ago to donate $750 for a bronze bust of the late chief to be
placed on top of the cabinet. The bust, - which is the work of Rupert Schmid, the
sculptor, was placed in position yesterday, and it was admitted to be a splendid
reproduction of the original, -;â â'"*.'
time a policeman was called un, who es
corted him to the California-street station.
"The man's story,'' said Colonel Young,
"was that he went to Hamburg a year ago,
and when he got back, three months ago,
he found his brother had died. He told
this to the officer, and said he did not
want to live any longer.
"He regretted that his efforts to end his
life had failed, and said he would make a
good job of it next time. Egan evidently
came here and took a room with the de
liberate intention of dying here."
The man was booked at the station for
drunkenness and yesterday morning was
discharged.
DEATH OF A DRUGGIST.
Henry It. Shaw, an Old and Respected
Iteaident, Expiree Suddenly.
Henry B. Shaw, the druggist, died sud
denly yesterday morning at his residence,
1906 Vallejo street. His death was caused
by congestion of the liver.
Mr. Shaw was an old resident of this
City. lie came here from New York in
1867, and soon after opened a drugstore on
Second street, near Folsom.
When Rincon Hill began to decline he
moved to Sutter and Powell streets. There
also his business prospered. About four
years ago he decided to retire from active
life and live upon his income. Inactivity,
however, was not congenial to him, and
within a year he again embarked in busi
ness, entering the firm of Wakelee ___ Co.
When he retired from tbat establishment,
about a year ago, he engaged in business
for himself at 3 Montgomery street. He
personally conducted the latter place un
til about a week ago, when he became ill,
but did not consider his condition serious.
Mr. Shaw was a veteran of the Civil
War. He was a member of George H.
Thomas Post, G. A. R., and several fra
ternal societies. He had large property
holdings in this City, including his resi
dence on Vallejo street. His fortune is
estimated at a quarter of a million.
He was about fifty-five years of age, and
was a native of Ireland. He leaves a
widow. The funeral will take place on
Thursday afternoon from 1906 Vallejo.

The So-Called Christians Have Not
Followed the Doctrines as
Laid Down.
Colonel Taylor Rogers was scheduled to
deliver a lecture before Liberty Branch of
the Socialist Labor party last evening at
the Turk-street Temple on the "Econom
ics of the Sermon on the Mount.'* He
carried out the programme, although for
a brief interval in the midst of it
there were grave fears that he might
not. He had forgotten his Bible. By a
most unforeseen accident, as it developed,
on* in the large audience was a Christian
believer, and not only that, but he had
his Bible with him, with the leaf turned
down at the Sermon on the Mount. As
the book was handed up to him the
speaker, who plainly confessed himself to
be no church member, found himself to
be almost persuaded to believe in miracles.
The cloudy prospect for the lecture cleared
up immediately.
'Economic law, according to the Greek
derivation of the word, said the speaker,
is a law of the household municipality,
state, nation or the world.
. Discussing the economic law of the Ser
mon on the Mount, the speaker said he
would not do so from the standpoint of
the theologian, as he belonged to no
i church.
The lecture would have to do with
earth, earth, earth; it would never get
away from the earth, he said. He knew
of no other state and the earth was quite
good enough for him. In his introduc
tory remarks he referred to the prodigal
ity of nature, the necessity of man to
work, and to t c social nature of man â all
of them absolute laws of nature.
Private property be charged as the one
great wrong of the world. Greece and
Rome and the long line of nations and
empires of the world had fallen through
the absorption of theland into the hands
of a few. At tbeir beginning in every case
tbe land was held in common. At their
fall the great majority of the people were
not allowed to trespass upon the land ex
cept to labor for its owner.
Turning to the Sermon on the Mount he
called attention to its utterances, as they
agreed with tne doctrines of the modern
apostles of socialism. He said that from
the pulpits of these times one could only
learn that Christ taught of the world and
the life to come. The speaker said that
about nine-tenths of Christ's teachings re
lated to this world, and if they were fol
lowed the grinding competitive system
would long ago have disappeared and all
things would be held in common.
lf Christ was divine he could promul
gate no error. He had been acknowledged
by atheists and bis so-called followers
alike for 1800 years to be one of the great
est teachers of the world intellectually
and morally.
He believed that all things should be
held in common, an advised the young
man before undertaking to follow him to
first dispose of all tbat he had. His im
mediate followers refused to go to war,
refused to accept office and believed in the
equality of the sexes and in monogamic
marriage. â¢. *,'.
"How are.we to get back to the com
munistic conditions?" he asked. By
taking up the institutions of commerce
and production, one by one, and incorpo
rating them into the system of government
is one way, tho way I believe to be best.
Accomplished in the full, we would have
the conditions Christ advocated and
would realize the fatherhood of God, the
brotherhood of man and the motherhood
of earth in all its radiant splendor."
Tbe lecture was liberally applauded and
also liberally criticized in the five-minute
speeches. "

Board of Education Rein
states the Deposed
Janitors.
An Effort Made to Give a Long
Lease on School Prop
erty.
A Lively Wrangle Over en Attempt
to Create a N;w Standing
Committee.
Two important matters came tip before
the Board of Education at its meeting
last evening. One was the re-establish
ment of the old force of janitors, and the
second was relative to granting a long
time lease on the School Department's
property on Fifth and Market streets.
At a recent meeting an effort was made
to oust nearly tha entire force of janitor
esses and janitors and fill the vacancies
with a new force. This movement pro
voked much opposition, but the majority
held the whip hand and paid but little
attention to the assertion that they were
throwing out needy people to make room
for political friends.
Last evening the Janitors Committee
presented a recommendation that the
new appointees, twenty-four in number, be
dismissed, and the old lot, with a dozen
or more added, be back again. This
was adopted, and the fortunate are the
following:
A. Ascl'er, Henry Durant School; Mrs. K. A.
Hunter, Cooper Primary; Mrs. M.Gallagher,
Hearst Grammar; Mrs. N. Moore, Laguna
Honda; Mrs. Craig, Hunters Point; Mrs.

Near the close of the meeting Director
Burns offered a resolution tbat the Board
of Education lease the school property on
Fifth and Market streets for a period of
fifty years and that permission be asked
of tbe Le.* stature to make such a deal.
It was argued that the department is in
need of money and that on such a lease a
considerable sum could be raised â more,
in fact, than could be obtained on a
shorter lease. The proposition was buried
out of sight by the motion being referred
to 'he Judiciary Committee.
A communication was received from
Auditor Broderick giving his reasons for
refusing to audit the architects demands
for $800 on the Mission High School work.
He claimed that this would exceed the
$200,000 appropriation for the build
ing, etc.
The following report of the Classifica
tion Committee was adopted:
That Miss Jessie I. King be transferred from
the Peabody Primary to the charge of Miss
Adeline Ephraim's class in the Douglass
Primary School, and that Miss Adeline
Ephraim De transferred from the Doug
lass Primary School to the Peabody Pri
mary School; that Mrs. A. M. Brown
be transferred from the unasÂ«ic_ned list
to the charge of Miss Hattie L. Wooll's class
in the Hawthorne Primary School; that Miss
Hattie L. Wooll be transferred from the Haw

School; that Miss Mary A. Barrett

School to the Adams Cosmopolitan Grammar
School; that a new c'.a*s be formed in the
Girls' __-.igh;School, and that Mrs. Irene Reeves
of the Hich School substitute class be as
signed to the charge of the said High School
class; that all matters in reference to special
teachers be indefinitely postponed.
A long discussion amounting at tiroes
to a personal wrangle was caused by a
proposition to create a new standing com
mittee, to be known as the Evening
Schools Committee. A protest was raised
by Director Derham. on the ground that it
would be a usurpation of the power of the

Attorney Reddy Shows That the
State Has Failed to Establish
Its Main Points-
Yesterday was an eventful day in the
trial of J. J. Cooney, charged with perjury
in certifying that he took the late James
G. Fair's acknowledgment to one of the
most important deeds in the iitigation
over the Fair millions.
The defense put in more than a hun
dred strong reasons going to bhow that
the Crocker blanks offered by the prose
cution as evidence of fraud are not the
same as the blanks used by Notary Cooney
in taking the Fair acknowledgment. Be
fore this point was argued in detail there
were some preliminary proceedings of
minor consequence relative to the identi
fication of important exhibits in the case. j
Judge Cook called Henry P. Smith and
Theodore Kitka to the stand the first
thing yesterday morning and had tnem
identify the photographic exhibits which
they took a few days ago for the prosecu
tion and defense. The negatives and
proofs were marked by the court for iden
tification.
After the identifications were concluded
Attorney Reddy filed the following
motion:
"Counsel for the defendant now move
the court to discharge the defendant on
the following grounds:
"Firstâ lt does not appear that a public
offense has been committed; and, second,
there is not sufficient cause to believe the
defendant guilty."
Mr. Reddy at once began an elaborate
argument in support of the motion. He
began by arraigning Captain Lees and bis
assistants lor the zealous attitude they had
taken in hunting evidence to substantiate
private interests and claims, stating that
the prosecution of Cooney was merely a
side issue, undertaken fof the purpose of
destroying the value of his testimony to
be given at a future time in the litigation
over the late Senator's millions.
"I cite to your Honor," he said, "the
well-known case of the People against
Wells, in which the Supreme Court of
this State dealt with the question of what
elements go to make a conviction of per
jury lawful, and I argue by analogy that
no case has been made out against the
the man they are so eagerly trying to
hound to the penitentiary."
Mr. Reddy relied largely on the rule
which requires the testimony of at least
one witness to some material fact before
defendants may be convicted in perjury
cases. He said that the central fact in the
prosecution's case was the attempt to
prove that James G. Fair did not go to J.
J. Cooney's office on tbe 27th of Septem
ber, 1894, to acknowledge the pencil deeds.
He argued that no witness had come for
ward to testify to that important fact for
the people, and that the only evidence
even remotely tending to show the prose
cution's contention was that the certifi
cates used by Coouey were not in existence
until nearly two years after their alleged
date.
"This is the ultimate fact in the case,"
said the speaker, "and all other facts
merely circle about it. But I hold that
even this fact loses its value when care
fully scrutinized. There are no allega
tions that the alleged deed in this case
was ever delivered to any one, and it is
well-known law that if a deed is not de
livered it is worthless and neither injure
nor benefit any one. It may be argued
that the deed was executed, even if not
delivered; but the word executed, used in
this sense, is not general enough to repair
the breaks in the prosecution's case. I
made the broad statement that the
charges against defendant are immaterial.
Most of its recitations are of merely evi
dential facts. All this talk about differ
ent blanks and about a bank meeting
amounts to nothing except as evidence
feebly tending to show an alibi, but it vio
lates the main rule about alibis, namely,
that the alibi must preclude the possibil
ity that defendant was at the place
charged.
"So we sift it all down and come to the
one fact, the main allegation of their
case, which is that Senator Fair did not
appear at Cooney's office on the date
charged and that Cooney's certificate is
false.
"Now, let me remind the court of what
is common knowledge to your Honor. I
want to say that all the burdens are on
the prosecution. They try to overcome
the oath of the defendant by certain cir
cumstances. Well, to make their ca?e
they must absolutely overcome the de
fendant's oath, override the presumption
of law that the notary's certificate is
correct, and also overcome the strong pre
sumption of tha law that the defendant is
innocent. They have feebly tried to stag
ger at such proof by two methods. First,
they have tried to show by his valet,
Clarke, that Fair was not at Cooney's
office, and they have also tried another
method. They have tried to show that
certificates of the character used by
Cooney did not exist at the time.
"Weil, Clarke was a new find for the
prosecution and a surprise, but we must
remember that if a witness is badly needed
the San Francisco detective force requires
but little time to discover him. However,
Clark* was a harmless wonder in bis way.
He could remember nothing of any value
to. ps or of any danger to him. In truth
his memory extended to nothing except
what the prosecution wanted him to re
member. The prosecution declined to
produce Clarke's books of memoranda
and the presumption arises that the con*
tents of those books were prejudicial to
the case of the people. I desire to say
here and now that if the evidence of such
a man as Clarke, if* the testimony of a
man with such a treacherous memory is
to be of consequence, nobody is safe. He
remembered nothingâ did not even recall
the death-dealing attempts of the Senator
to kill fishes in the Colorado River by
dynamite. ..'...:-"
"But even if Clarke's evidence were
true he has not accounted for all the time
on the day in question. He was in room
A and Fair was in room C. A conversa
tion could not be overheard and for two
hours the witness could not know whether
or not the Senator left the room."
On the point of the Crocker certificates
Mr. Reddy argued that no one had sworn
what was printed before 1895. " The auper
Judge and Attorneys Comparing the Blanks Against the /Light to Discover Discrepancies in
the Evidence.
intendent could not say positively because
the proofs were destroyed and be did not
know what had been issued before 1895.
"Counsel do not dare," he said, "to af
firm that any witness swore that no such
forms were ever printed prior to 1895. If
they have the temerity to argue that any
witness swore this way they will please
name him. Yet the prosecution . prom
ised to prove positively that no such form
was printed prior to 1896. They have
made no sucb proof and can make none.
We, on the other hand, can positively
show that the blanks are not alike. We
will show that money power and thai
somebody has suborned perjury. We
have not deceived the public or tried our
case in the papers. We can show that
millionaires sometimes make their money
by fraud and hold it in the same >vay."
Ex-Judge Denson followed Mr. Reddy
for the defense in an elaborate argument
on the differences between the Cooney cer
tificate and the exhibit numbered 16.
"If your Honor will apply a fine rule
and measure the printing of the two,"
said he, "yon will find a variance of 1-32
of an inch. A careful man has measured
the two and has shown more than 100
discrepancies."
The court's attention was then called to
the fact that the "S" in "State" in the
Cooney certificate is square or blunt,
while the same thing in the Crocker
blank, marked "exhibit 16," is round.
The following were some of the points
made:
The "t" in the same word of the cer
tificate is straight, while it is crooked in
tbe blans.
The second "t" in the word "State" of
the Crocker blank is solid and complete,
while in the Cooney document it is split.
"The "o" in "of" is broken differently
tban tbe break in the same letter in the
certificate,
The letter â¢*__-** in "of" of the Crocker
blank is almost complete, but it is not in
the other. The defense contended that
whenever the identity failed in so sub
stantial a way it showed that the docu
ments were not the same.
In the word "California" tbe capital
"C" was shown to be at wholly varying
angles. It was shown that, by a fine
rule, the variance wonld be fifteen de
grees.
In a similar way it was shown that
there were great variations in the letter
"1" in the word "California."
The letter "i" in the same-word "Cali
fornia" was shown to have dots of wholly
different size.
The dotted lines or rules in the two cer
tificates were shown to be of wholly differ
ent lengths, -rt.:
It was shown that the brace" in the two
certificates were wholly unlike, thai in
the Crocker blank being heavier and one
tenth of an inch longer than that in the
Cooney certificate.
In the word "hundred" it was shown
that the "r" was complete in the Crocker
exhibit but, partly gone in the Cooney
certificate.
By superimposition to the light it was
shown that the documents failed to agree
in many particulars.
The case will go on to-day and the at
torneys will devote the forenoon at least
to argument. Judge Cook ordered the
jury to appear in court for further hear
ing of tbe case on Friday.

Now Some of the Local Banks
Sue to Have Their Cash
Returned.
Judge Seaweil Intimates That General
Deposits Abroad Will Have to
Be Taxd Here.
Jndge Seaweil of the Superior Court
yesterday handed down an important
opinion in tbe case of the Nevada Bank
of San Francisco against the City and
County of Ban Francisco wherein it is
sought to recover $20,613 06 alleged to have
been improperly collected for taxes, inas
much as the Assessor levied taxes on
moneys that the bank alleged were de
poured with correspondents and other
banks outside of the State of California.
The decision, which overrules the City's
demurrer to the bank's complaint, bas a
direct bearing on the revenue of the City,
for if the theory of the Nevada Bank is
right, the cash revenue of the City from
taxation of personal property will be di
minished at least $200,000, and the bank
ing institutions of the City will, of course,
be benefited to that extent.
The full text of Judge Seawell's decision
Is as follows:
I do not think that the complaint presents
the question discussed by counsel in reference
to the moneys deposited with plaintiff's corre
spondents in places outside tne State of Cali
fornia.
It is alleged in the complaint that on the
first Monday in March, 1896. plaintiff had on
deposit with its correspondents in London,
Paris, New York, Boston and Philadelphia
moneys aggregating $1,474,257, "whlcn last
mentioned sum of money on the day and year
last aforesaid was situated wholly witnout the
territorial limits and jurisdiction of the State
of California."
It is true that a general depositor in a bank
is simply a creditor, and It is also true that in
a strictly legal sense such a person has not
any money on deposit at all. The money
which he deposited is the property of tne
bank, and the relation of the parties is that
of debtor and creditor.
When the plaintiff alleges that at a certain
date it had on deposit with Its correspondent
in London a certain sum of money, which was
then situated wholly outside the State, I am
not at liberty to assume, upon a general de
murrer, that plaintiff did not own the money
alleged to be on deposit, or that plaintiff was
merely the creditor of the correspondent. The
demurrer to the complaint will therefore be
overruled. < .* â¢_.*=;*
For several years it bas been noted that
on the day tbe tax levy is made many of
the local banks have large amounts of
money on deposit beyond the limits of
the State. If the theory advanced in this
suit is upheld by tbe courts then all the
banks will escape taxation on the moneys
thus deposited outside the State. If the
City wins the suit the taxes will have to
be paid, no matter where tbe coin is situ
ated.
Deputy City Attorney Rhodes Borden
has charge of the City's end of the litiga
tion, and when apprised of the fact that
his demurrer was overruled said, that be
would at once put in an answer alleging
that the aeposits mentioned in the bank's
complaint are general deposits and that
as such they must be taxed here.
In support of this position Mr. Borden
will rely on some of the points set forth in
h.j brief on the demurrer. Briefly stated,
tbe main point is as follows:
When plaintiff deposited its money abroad it
lost all property in the money itself and took
in. tend the promise of the banks outside of
the State to honor its drafts up to the amount
deposited. This promise to pay is but a chose
in action an intangible species of property be
longing to the person who has the right to en
force it and is taxable as a solvent credit at
the domicile of the own r; to wit, here in
California. It is not taxable anywhere else.
Mr. Borden thought that the City had a
right to assume, in the absence of any al
legation in the complaint to the contrary,
that the deposit was a general deposit, but
Judge Seaweil ruled against him on that
matter, and testimony must be heard
touching the real status of tbe money.
"I am perfectly satisfied that the court
is with me in regard to the law, lor that
appears on the face of the' opinion," said
Mr. Borden. "It comes down to a ques
tion of fact. If those deposits were spe
cial deposits we have no right to tax them
any more than we would have to tax a
| horse that is owned by a citizen of San
Francisco, but which is in London on the
first Monday oi March, when the levy is
made. If those deposits are general de
posits, then the banks will not be success
ful in resisting collection of the taxes, for
the action of the Assessor will be upheld
by the courts.
"1 speak of this litigation freely and of
the phases presented by Judge Seawell's
decision because the public is greatly in
terested in the result of the litigation. If
it were a private suit it would be alto
gether different."
The brief on behalf of tbe City, already
on file, gives a clear idea of the City At
torney's definition of a special deposit.
The report of the president of the Ne
vada Bank to the Bank Commissioners
mentioned the identical moneys involved
in this suit as "being due from other
banks and correspondents." That will
be an important fact on which the City
will base its claim, for it has been decided
that "whenever the money deposited is
mingled with the general funds of the
bank it is a general deposit'?
Additional comments in tbe brief are
as follows:
When the deposit is special, the bank with
which it is made bas no right to touch or to
use the the coin, or even to open the package
without special directions to that end by the
bailor. See Marine Bank vs. Ruckmore, 23
IU., 463, and Foster vs. Essex Bank, 17 Mass.,
Even when money is left with a bank merely
for sale keeping, unless there is a specisl un
derstanding that the identical money is to be
returned, the deposit is but a general deposit
See Boon on Banking, section 41, and Schoe
maker vs. Henze, 53 Wise, 116.
Dozens of cases are in the books to show
that a general deposit abroad creating a
debt due to a resident of California is tax
able here.
Attorney T. I. Bergin, who represents
the Nevada Bank, contends that the de
posits being made abroad for a special
purpose, namely, for the purpose of meet
ing drafts made by the plaintiff, they are
therefore special deposits in the strict
sense of the word, and therefore not tax
able here.
Several cases of a similar character are
pending in the Superior Court aggregating
a large amount of money, and every tax
payer is directly affected by the result.

A Railroad Petition Favor

Act.
Rolla V. Watt Says Restrictions

Railroad Commission Declines to Tak
Sides Against Ticket Brokers.
Watt's Letter.
â 
;
Commissioners Stanton and LaÃue com
prised the "working majority" and the
only members of the State Railroad Com
mission pre-ent at a meeting of the com
mission yesterday afternoon.
William B. May, an ex-Assemblyman,
now district passenger agent of the South
ern Pacific Railroad, with headquarters at
Fresno, appeared before the commission
and was allowed to present a petition and
mate an address in support of it. He
wanted the signatures of tbe Commis
sioners. li|la|!
The petition is the same one that is said
to have been signed by many members of
the present Legislature. It is addressed to
the California delegation in Congress and
asKs their support for the amendment to
the interstate commerce act, now pending
in Congress, prohibiting the "scalping"
of railroad tickets. In the way of both
State and local interest District Passenger
Agent May read the following copy of a
telegram which he said had been for
warded to Washington by Rolla V. Watt:
San Francisco, Feb. 2, 1897. *
California Representatives, House ofÃepresent
alius, care Han. James G. Maguire, Washington,
li. C: It has been finally determined that the
international convention oi the Christian
Endeavor Society will be held in this City in
Juiy next. The transportation companies
have made this possible by conceding the
rates requested by us, which are the lowest
ever offend.
We promised the railroads if they would do
this our best aid to protect tnem. Our utmost
efforts and theirs will not prevent serious
abuse.
Reports from all sources indicate the largest
gathering ever held on the Pacific Coast, and
fraught with the greatest possibilities for
California.
"We are therefore specially interested in the
bill now before the House to regulate the sale
of railroad tickets, in the form of an amend
ment to the interstate commerce act, and
would respectiully* urge your earnest and
constant support thereof. The whole Pacific
Coast and the entire Christian Endeavor So
ciety of the United States with its 2,000,000
membership are especially interested lv mak
ing the '97 convention in every way a success
and in preventing anything that will tend to
detract from its fame, as would a large traf
ficking in railroad and steamship tickets by
unprincipled and irresponsible outside par
ties. If the amendment be not passed it will
doubtless result in the transcontinental lines
placing snch restrictions upon the tickets as
will seriously interfere with the attendance
and prevent the coming of many hundreds if
not thousands. We favor the amendment on
principle as well as on account of the forego
ing local considerations.
Sixteenth International Christian Endeavor
Committee, by Rolla V. Watt, Chairman.
C. __**_ Bakes, Secretary.
It was also stated by Mr. May that one
of the very few prominent public organi
zations in San Francisco which had de
clined to sign the petition was tbe Slate
Board ol Trade. W. H. Mills is one of
the directors of this board. His official
railroad title is land agent, land depart
ment, Central Pacific Railroad Company.
Mr. May was greatly amused, and thought
it was a great joke that Mr. Mills would
not sign a petition in the interest of the
road. V- â¢â ',' IX ;
A. Ottinger, a local ticket- broker, ad
dressed the commission in behalf of the
"scalpers." He saia, in brief, that the
ticket-broker is a public benefactor. He
offers to sell to the public unused or por
tions of unused railroad tickets at reduced
rates, whereas otherwise the money for
them would remain in the coffers of the
railroad company and nobody would get
the use of the ticket.
The Commissioners concluded not to
sign the petition.
Along this line Commissioner La Rue
remarked that interstate tickets ought to
be made good till used.
Since the last meeting printed copies of
forms for making annual reports and in
regard to classification of operating ex
penses of railroads were received from the
Interstate Commission at Commissioner
Stanton's request, and the Commissioners
proceeded to compare them with the
forms already in use by the State Com
mission in California. Though the com
parison was uot complete, it appeared
that they were substantially the same.
A letter from E. E. Wright, assistant
controller of the Southern Pacific, was
read, stating that the company had, in
order to meet the forms of the Interstate
Commerce Commission and the commis
sion of this State, and furnish informa
tion, changed its fiscal year from Decem
ber 31 to June 30, and expressed the hope
that the commission would find the forms
more satisfactory than they bad been.
He stated that a different method of re
porting than was made to the Interstate
Commerce Commission and to the United
States Commissioner of Railroads would
put the company to much expense.
* Last evening Rolla V. Watt said, in ref
erence to his telegram to the California
Congressional delegation:
"My opinion of that date has since been
confirmed. Restrictions have since been
placed on the sale of the $31 round-trip
ticket from Chicago in the matter of stop
over privileges, i have seen the schedule
made by Manager Colville of the Western
Traffic Association, and for instance there
are, on the return ticket, no stopover priv
ileges north of Redding, Cal. :>

evening on the Southern overland from
Dallas, Tex., and after remaining in the
"City one hour took bis departure on the
6 o'clock train for Reno.
An enterprising photographer made a
desperate attempt to take a snapshot with
his camera at Dan as he was waiting at
tte depot for tbe departure of tbe boat
which connects with the overland on the
other side of the water, but tbe quick eye
of the famous sporting man detected "the
fiend" and he turned bis back just in time
to save his features,, which were stubbed
by a three days' growth of whiskers, from
appearing in a morning paper.
"I would have no objection," said Stu
art, smilingly, "to give you an opportu
nity of snapshooting me if I were in good
condition, but you see I now look like a
farmer, and, not having bad time to see a
toniorial artist since my arrival, 1 would
rather leave the picture turned to the wall
for the present," and the tut acquiesced.
SHERIFF WILLIAM KINNEY OF ORMSBY COUNTY.
Should the Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight take place in Carson, this officer will . preserve
order at the ringside, and upon him will devolve the duty ol weighing the gloves. In addi
tion to the Shrievalty, Kinney holds the offices of Chief of Police, City marshal, Constable
and Chief of the Fire Department iv Carson.
Stuart said that he could not give even
a hint as to the place where the fi^ht will
be held, as be must first see some of tbe
leading sporting men and financiers of
Reno and Carson before anything definite
regarding the battle-ground can be de
cided upon. '
"To be candid with you," said Stuart,
"I don't care where tbe contest will be
held as long as it is in the State of Ne
vada. I dare say, though, that either
Reno or Carson will be selected. Reno
has the advantage so far as the telegraphic
facilities are concerned, but all this mat
ter will rest, as 1 previously said, witb
the leading men of the State wbo have
been instrumental in the passage of an
act permitting finish contests. After I
see the Reno people, wbieh will be to
morrow, I think the public will know
where the championship heavy-weight
battle will be decided."
Regarding the gambling facilities Stu
art said that i.c guessed it would be "first
come first served," and that be had noth
ing to do with the pool-selling privileges.
He did not hesitate to say that be would
be represented in the pool-selling venture,
as lie expected that large sums of money
would be wagered on the result. He had
telegrams from prominent Eastern sport
ing men which stated that _S *w York and
other large Eastern cities would be well
represented at the mill.
Regarding rates between this City and
whichever place in Nevada State the fight
will be held he said that Mr. "Wheelock,
his advance agent, had made very satis
factory arrangements with the railroad
officials here, and that as soon as the bat
tle-ground is decided upon the} people
of this City will be informed on matters
pertaining to rates and transportation.
When asked as to tbe prices of admis
sion to the fistic carnival be intended to
charge, Stuart said that the figures would
be within reach of all; that fouriatesof
admission have already been decided
upon, and they will range from $5 to $40.
Stuart did not take much notice of the
report that the lumbermen of Truckee
had arranged to overpower tbe officers
who will be detailed on the doors leading
into the amphitheater in which the fight
will take place.
"I will arrange matters when I reach
Truckee to-morrow morning," said Stuart,
"with the superintendents of the mills so
that tbe people who witness the fight
may have no reason to fear any disturb
ance from millmen, or in fact any body of
men who may contemplate a raid on the
battle-ground.
"You can wager and be sure of winning
youi bet besides," said Stuart, "that who
ever will try on any sucb game will re
ceive the warmest reception that any man
ever got, and that's all I have to say in
the matter."
The great tight promoter is arranging
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1897.
for other attractions apart from the event
of the day, as Billy Jordan would say.
"As no one can even conjecture the
number of rounds the tight will last," re
marked Stuart, "I have been figuring on
some attractions which should interest all
lovers of good sports. I had some idea of
matching Sharkey and Maher, or Maher
and Choynski, but you see those fellows
are looking for a fortune, and I don't pro
pose to give them any such thing.
"I am, however, seriously thinking of
matching George Lavigne, the Saginaw
Kid, and Walcott, the colored lad wno
made such a gallant stand before the clever
Lavigne a lew months -ago. You know
Walcott trained down several pounds be
low his best fighting weight when he met
and was defeated by Lavigne, but I think
that if the Saginaw Kid can be induced
to tight Walcott to a finish, and both of
the men weigh in at the ringside at 140
pounds, tne people would witness one of
the greatest mills, irom a scientific point
of view, that has ever been pulled off in
this country."
When asked what he thought of a
match between Tommy Ryan and George
Green, Stuart hesitated a moment and
tben said tbat tie bad no reason to doubt
tbat a contest between these two clever
fellows would prove a good drawing card,
bat at present be could not decide upon
anything; that be must first consult with
the people of Reno before going deeper
into the future.
"1 will tell you one thing, though," said
Stuart after recovering from a short think
ing spell. "We may have an inter-State
live-bird shoot a week or so before the big
fi;_ht. While traveling through the East
I met several noted sportsmen who were
very anxious to see the great trap-shooters
of America brought together. Now a 100
--bird race lor a large stake between . such
noted trap-shooters as Budd, Work,
Wright, Carver, Graham, Hoey, Knapp,
Williams, McMurchy, Hoyt, Macalester,
Ewing, Rutherford, Webster and others
whose names have been mentioned to me,
should prove a great attraction, and I
think such an event will ba held.
"Pigeon-shooting is one of the great
drawing cards at Monte Carlo, and thou
sands of dollars change hands on tbe re
sults. We have just as good shots in
America â if not better as in any other
part of the world where trap-shooting is
indulged in, and as shooting men of all
kinds will visit Nevada next month I
think that a trap-shooting tournament
will prove very interesting."
Stuart spoke of Fitzsimmons' strange
freak in tearing. up some agreement he
had signed with Corbett relative to a side
bet they bad made several months ago.
"Well, so far as side bets are con
cerned," said Stuart; "all I know is that
Julian, who is Fitzsimmons' manager,
telegraphed me at Dallas that be had
posted with Al Smith the full amount of
coin that I insisted upon guaranteeing
Fitzsimmons' appearance in the ring on
March 17. Corbett has posted his stuff,
but so far as any side bets between the
principals are concerned I can't give you
any information, as it cuts no ice with me.
"When I saw Corbett last, which was a
week or so ago, he looked first-class and
I have no doubt that he will enter the
ring in tip-top condition to give a good
account of himself. Fitz is always in
good trim and tbe sporting people of
Texas and New Orleans will back him
very heavily. I cannot say who will win.
Corbett is very sanguine of success and so
is Fitz."
COHBETT HUM Eli AUD SOUND.
Speeches Make Him Tired, but He Talks
All the Hay.
BOCA, Cal., Feb. 10.â Corbett is head
ing .for San . Francisco along with his
brother Harry. The Call correspondent
met tbe champion in his sleeper at Wads
worth, with his wife and burly sparring
partner. Jack McVey. He had been train
ing bard all along the road, and is as clean
as a greyhound.
"Well, old fellow," he said, "I have not
so very much to say, except that I'm as
round as a wire nail, and I never felt so
well or in better condition since I was
born. I've been training right along and
I'm longing for the 17th. Yes, I guess
from all I can learn that I will be at Car
son City and that I am to train at Sbaws
Hot Springs.
"Oh, yes, I beard what Fitz had to say
about my tight with Mitchell being a fake.
Guess he must have got mixed uo with
that little affair be had with Hall. 1 don't
pay much attention to those sideshow
talks of Fitzsimmons and I don't propose
to notice any of his eccentric utterances.
He can't keep from talking a lot of fool
ishness, and I don't feel like interrupting
his pastime; would you?
"By the way, be says be don't propose
to let the fight go on until bis physician
has examined me. Well, I like that. Now,
suppose his old sawDones looks me
over and says that I have bots,
spavin, ringbone and springhalt, I
suppose tben the tight must be stopped
because I am disqualified. No, no; tbat
doesn't go; but 1 will say tbat any time
Mr. Fitzsimmons wishes to examine me
he can do so. provided it is in the ring. If
the law of Nevada says doctor, why then
doctors go; but they can't be dragged in
by him. I'd advise him, however, to have
a doctor on deck to look after him when
the fight is over; that's the time he will
need one.
"Still I don't want it to be understood
that I think he's an easy mark; no. no;
he's a hard man to wind up and clever.
I consider that he stands next to
me* as a ring-fighter, but of course
I think lam a No. 1. If I am mistaken,
and be can convince me of my mistake,
why. the sooner I find it oul the better.
We have been leading up to this thing for
years, and the public want the question
settled â and I guess it will be settled in
Carson City, Nev., on tbe 17ib.
"I will appear nt the Chutes on Sunday
and give two performances, and will leave
for Carson on Monday and arrive there
Tuesday. All I need now is three weeks
of outdoor work and handball exercise
to keep my muscles in eood quick play.
Billy Delaney, Charles White and Jacic
McVey will be in my corner during the
fight. Billy Wools .and Joe Eagan are
aboard and will get off at Reno. Tney
will help me train.
"We have great crowds at every station,
and they call for speeches, but I can't do
much at speech-making. Speeches make
me tired. Somehow they require a whole
lot of exertion when the crowd is in front,
and I feel nervous when I am called on to
do tbe Demosthenes act; I'd about as
soon take a licking as make a speech."
"That's right, Jack; open that small
bottle and have some put on tbe ice."."
There was a halt at Reno, and a great
crowd . was waiting. Nearly all
the State officers were there, hav
ing come down in the evening to
inspect the public buildings at Reno.
Governor Sadler, State Treasurer Wester
field and Controller La Grave were on the
train, as well as several members of tbe
Legislature. Harry Corbett wedged his
way through the crowd and dragged the
Governor up the steps into Jim's car.
"Jim, shake hands with Governor Sad
ler," said Harry. \
Corbett was on his feet at once and gave
the Governor a hearty handshake.
"Weil, by Jove!" exclaimed the cham
pion. "So you are the man who bad tbe
tand to sign the prize-fight bill? I'm
devilish glad to meet such a man. Shake
again! Lots *of these Governors would
walk a mile to seethe mill, but hesitate to
sign the bill, fearing to lose a few votes."
Here tbe crowd began to yell for a
speech, and the champion stepped to the
platform and looked out over a sea of
hats. He tried several times and the
crowd kept veiling. Finally he said:
"Boys, I'm going to be iv the ring on
Scene in Commissioner Heacock's Court While Attorney Cormac "Was Introducing as Evidence Certain
Depositions for the British Government.
the 17th ana I'm going out a winner. I
believe I can whip my man, and if I didn't
think so I wouldn't have made the match.
But don't ask me to telk. Perhaps when
Mr. Fitzsimmons comes through here he
can give you a longer speech. This talk
ing seems to come easy to him. Laugh
ter.] I haven't preached to such a big
congregation anywhere else along the
line."
Three cheers were given with great
gusto, when Mr. Q'Keefe, a local sport,
yelied: "If you can't do up tbat blasted
Cornisbman don't ever pass through Reno
alive again," and there was another roar
as the train pulled out.
As soon as his brother Harry got into
the smoker the two sat down facing each
other and began to chatter like magpies.
Each wanted to tell some experience.
"I say. Jim, Carson is just clean gone
crazy. Last Sunday "
"But wait, Harry, till I tell you my
Chicago experience."
As the two men talk, both sparring for
an opening, they put up their bands and
then clinched, each half raising from his
seat Jim grabbed bis brother like a
child by both arms, slammed him down
in his seat and in tbe mixup he got the
right of way for his story and told the
following: *
"Harry, I ran up against the cleverest
amateur boxer I ever saw at the Chicago
Athletic Club. His name was Dr. Pine, a
dentist, that stood 6 feet 2, weighed 190
and was as strong as a bull."
"Oh. bother your Chicago dentist; let
me tell you of Al Livingston of Car
son. He started the who'e works,
and he's got a stomach on him like â "
Jim rushed in and smothered his lo
quacious brother back into bis seat.
"Well, I had a go with this chap at tbe
athletic club, and he came onto me like
a snowslide. He let go straight swings,
leads, uppercuts and the whole thing, and
I had to hustle like the deuce to Keep
out of his way. Oh, don't you make any
mistake; he was a clever guy and be- i
longed to the swell set. I was never so j
astonished in my life ana never had to
hustle any harder to keep from .going out.
You ought to have heard the club yell
when he was getting in his work."
"But you ought to see them at the Car
son depot â "
The champion grabbed his brother and
forced biro down again as he continued:
"He let np a second to see if I was dead,
when I reached for bis jaw with a left
jolt, and when bis hands went up I sent
my right into bis stomach, then back j
again on his jaw, just high enough to spoil |
bis teeth. He subsided and the Chicago j
club quit yelling."
All this time tbe boxer was swinging
and uppercutting witn both hands, re- j
hearsing the whole thing at regulation I
kinetoscope speed, and then went on to '
tell what a royal fellow the dentist was j
and what great friends be had made with
him. After which he warned The Call
reporter that it was not for publication.
Harry started his Carson story and the
reporter went out and hunted up Jack
McVey in another part of the car. Said
McVey, "He is as sound as a cannon-ball |
and every muscio 19 as hard as a rock, i
Any talk to the contrary is all bosh. I
He was soft wben be met Sharkey
aud the deal he got that night was the
best, lesson he ever had in his life. He
realized it ana has kept in training ever
since. He will toe tbe scratch in better
condition and be a harder hitter than I
ever â full of ginger and confidence to put j
up the battle of his life."
Mrs. Corbett accompanied her husband
on the train. The lady is in good health
and spirits and thinks Jim has a walkover.
Stuart will reach Carson to-morrow
bout 9:30 a. M. At about the same time
Jim is expected to land in San Francisco.

that giving up so many rooms to the

His skull Fractured.
L L. Daniels, a horse-trainer living at
the New Washington Hotel, is in a critical
condition at the Receiving Hospital, and
A. Phillips, another horse-trainer, had a
narrow escape.
Daniels was driving a spirited horse
along Golden Gate avenue last evening,
accompanied by Phillips, and something
frightened the animal. It bolted and
Daniels found himself unable to restrain
it. He called upon Phillips to heip him
and Phillips caught hold of the reins.
The sudden tug made the horse swerve
toward the sidewalk and the wheel of the
buggy struck the curbstone with such
force ns to throw both occupants out.
Daniels wjÂ»s taken tothe Receiving Hos
pital, where it was found that his skull
was fractured and he was suffering from
concussion of the brain. He was at
tended to by Drs. Rinne and O'Brien.
Phillips escaped with abrasions on his
legs aud arms.

Team Captains Sleet to Arrange for tha

Another lively special meeting of the

shin.
The discussion of the latter subject re
sulted in the display of much feeling, as
there is a firm determination to live up to
the rules in reference to the members of
each team being born in the country
which his team represents. A man named
Smith in the Canadian team wa* trans
ferred to the Irish team, as it was learned
that he was born in Ireland, though be has
lived since childhood in Canada.
His name appears on the great register
giving Ireland as his birthplace, and he
will be at borne among his hardy country
men, captained by James Hardnedy, who
is very much pleased with his new man. ;

by Pid well's associates in the defense of
Butler, Messrs. Stone, Black and Leming.
In view of this proceeding, section 496 of,
the Penal Code of California is brought
forward. It states plainly that any person
purchasing stolen property sball be liable
to prosecution on a charge of felony and
subject, on conviction, to imprisonment
in the State prison for five years, the
County Jail for six months, or both insti
tutions for the time specified. It is not
likely, owing to the circumstances, that
any charge will be brougbt against Pid
well.
At 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon an
additional charge of murder was booked
against Lee Weller at the City Prison.
Deputies T. J. Gallagher and E. J. Hea
cock, representing United States Marshal
Baldwin, called at tbe jail for the Aus
tralian prisoner, and as. he was brought
forth Deputy Gallagher read to him an
additional warrant charging him with
murder.
The warrant was signed by J. W. War
burton, British Consul-General at this
port, accusing Weller of the murder of
Arthur Thomas Osborn Preston, and de
manding that the arresting officers take
in charge all the personal apparel found
in the possession of the prisoner at the
time of his arrest.
The extradition proceedings were re
sumed before United State?- Commissioner
Heacock at 2p. m. The evidence was not
concluded and it is probable tbat no de
cision will be reached before next week.
When court proceedings began Attor
ney Cormac, representing the British
Government, directed commissioner Hea
cock's attention to tbe fact tbat the pris
oner's attorneys had commenced suit in
the State Court to obtain possession of the
property found in the possession of the
prisoner at the time of bis arrest. This
action he believed to be . fatten in direct
affront of the order committing such
property into the custody of the United
States Marshal, and was therefore a mat
ter of contempt, however unintentional.
It seemed appropriate in bis opinion that
court adjourn in order that contempt pro
ceedings might be began against Butler's
attorneys.
Attorney Black at once entered objec
tion to any such proceeding, alleging that
tbe suit could not be classified as content
tuous, inasmuch as no specific order had
been made committing Butler's (or Ashe's)
property into tbe United States Marshal's
care. Investigation of the record of the
court showed tbe point to be well taken.
In the face of tbis discovery the court was
powerless to take notice of the replevin
suit instituted by Butler's attorneys.
Commissioner Heacock, however, de
cided tbat the matter should be settled
then and there, and made an order placing
all Butler's possessions in the custody of
Marshal Ba d win until the determination
of proceedings. Despite the order of the
State courts the disputed property must
now remain in posses.-ion of the Federal
Government, and any opposing order
might properly be regarded as a contempt
of the Commissioner's authority.
The attorneys for tbe British Govern
ment then introduced a photograph of
Preston found among Butler's effects.
Strenuous objection was made by Attor
ney Black that tbis was incompetent to
the case o; Weller, but the picture was in
troduced as evidence over his objection.
Nex". the documents relating to WrUer's
arrest were introduced to demonstrate
tbat all legal requirements bad been fully
met.
Tte remainder of the afternoon was
taken up by Attorney Cormac in a mo
notonous reading of tbe documents in
troduced at tbe preliminary examination
of tbe murder cases in Australia. "When
court adjourned he was still reading.
Charles Delaney's testimony was to the
effect that he had found the body, with a

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. â The wheat market to
day exhibited the continuation of strength which
has characterized it for more than a week. The
sentiment was bullish, and that alone appeared to
be the potent factor. The weather was favorable
for the growing crop, snow falling ln all portions
of the winter wneat belt, the Liverpool cables were
lower and a fair spring wheat movement continues,
yet notwithstanding these circumstances, which
ordinarily would create a bearish feeling, the
market gradually advanced from a lower opening.
Receipts at Cbicago were seven cars, and 64,264
bushels were taken irom store. The Northwest
had 218 cars against 224 last Wednesday and 655
a year ago. After noon the local crowd finding it
impracticable .o materially advance prices sold out,
a slump of over a cent from the outside taking
place. Closing Continental cables were lower,
Export c.earances were fair at 327,687 bu<hels.
May wheat opened from 76S/ 4 c to 7b%-x sold lie
tween 77% c and 76%@76%c, closing at 76% c,
%c under yesterday, .estimated receipts for'to
morrow 17 car*. No. 2 red spot wheat ranged
fro v 85% cto 87% c, closing at 86% cto 85%0.
CORNâ Was not greatly affected by the early
strength of wheat. The popular form of trading in
wheat ln the morning was to buy and at the
same prices, so thai scalpers found their opera
tions unprofitable. Liverpool cab.es were quiet
and unchanged Receipts were 243 cars, and
164,309 bushels were taken from store. Export
clearances amounted to 414,186 bushels. The
weakness of wbeat near the close caused corn to
drop in price. May corn opened at 24c, so. be
tween 24c and i 4%: and _.'3% c, closing at the In
side, %(&%c under yesterday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 400 cars.
OATS The same conditions which prevailed
In the corn market were shown In oats.
Trade was light and consisted of light scalping
transactions, In which lhe loss or gain, owing to
narrow fluctuations, was not great Receipts were
281 can, and 222 were taken from store. Oats
weakened with other grains later lv the day. May
oats closed %c lower. Estimated receipts for to
rn or, ow 300 car a
FLAXâ Was easy. Cash No. 1. 74c, nominal;
Northwestern, 76c: May, 76%@76%c; July, 78c,
nominal; September, 79% c Receipts were 27
cars.
PROVISIONSâ A very listless action was noted
in provisions. The hog market was depressed by
heavy receipts, and to coincide with it provisions
declined. May pork clo*ea 7%c lower, May lard
6c lower, and May ribs 6@7%c lower.
BUTTERâ Although butter was firm in price
to-day, dealers did not feel hopeful for a continua
tion of that feeling. The demand was good, but lt
was entirely for fancy stock.

UNION STOCKYARDS. 111.. Feb. JO.-Last
week's advance inthe price of cattle has stimu
lated the shipment of that stock from country
points, and the arrivals for the first half of this
week foot up 34,850 against 29,215 for the same
portion of last week, and 39.919 for the corre
sponding time a year ago. Supplies of beef in re
frlgeraters have been depleted by tbe recent pauc
ity of offerings, and buyers have therefore taken
hold well this week. About 13,000 head were re
ceived to-day. and there was a good demand for
cattle nt the st ady prices. The aveiage quality
of the cattle offered shows no itnprov mÂ»nt. To
day forthe first lime tbis week there was a fair
run of bogs, me receipts amounting to about 87.
--00*0 head. That brinxs the supply up for the first
half of the week to 84,160 bead against 307,944
last week and 74,1(9 a yeÂ»r aito. The offerings
were well taken by Chicago packers and Eastern
shippers, prices being weaker io 2%c per hundred
pounds lower. The market for sheep nas not been
overstocked this week, and prices for sheep are
steady, but lambs average a little lower, only
about 12,000 arrived to-day. and the market was
steady under the Influence of a good lemand.

The Pity of it.
He'd been waltzing with his host's
daughter and was in the corner repairing
damages. Here he was espied by his
would-be naps-in-law.
"She's the flower of my family," said
the latter.
'So it seems," answered the voting man.
"Pity she comes off 90, ain't lit?" he con
tinued, as he essayed another vigorous rub
at the white spots on his coat-sleeves. â

Mrs. Douglass Resents Ar
rest for Stealing Her
Wedding Ring.
Declares That Her Husband Was
Jealous of Some Youthful
Friends.
Says Mr. Douglass Is a Gocd Man,
but Their Tastes Are Quite
Different
Oakland Office San Feascisco Call,?
:. â¢, 908 Broadway, Feb. 10. J
Mrs. George A. Douglass has returned
to her home at Fruitvaie and offers the
following explanation of her experience at
San Jose last Saturday:
"I have not been living with my hus
band for six months," she said, "and I
feel very angry with him for following me
. to San Jose last Saturday. Ido net deny
that I was down there and that he found
me in company with a young boy, but I
do deny that there was anything wrong
in the matter. He was only a 17-year-old
â¢ rvonth whom 1 have known for years.
(i whom who were with me are acro
;he two boys who were with me are acro
\i ats, and I formerly sang on the stage
until my voice gave out. They wanted
me t3 arrange a tour of the State, and I
-was to manage the affair. Fancy my
husband having me arrested for petty
.larceny for stealing my own wedding
ring. It was my property and I had a
right to keep it.
: "The young boys used to write ms notes
of a very gushing nature and I thought to
little of them that I left them about the
house. My husband evidently found them
and thought they meant something, but
in fact they were very innocent epistles.
â¢He need not say so many mean things
about me, because I could say a great deal
that wqs unpleasant if I wanted to. I
have a little property and I think that
cuts some figure in the case. My husband
came to see me last night and he is really
a good man, but we are going to separate*
He can get the divorce if he wants; I
don't care. You know lam a great sport
ing woman. 1 like shooting, racing and
bicyie riding, bat I don't care for women
nor society. He does. So we do not agree
on that point, among others."
At San Jose Mrs. Douglass was arrested
. at the, instance of her husband while in the
company of a young man named Louis
Haehnlen. Haehnlen was also arrested
and charged with disturbing Douglass'
â¢ peace by enticing bis wife away. Mrs.
Douglass was charged with petty larceny
for the theft of her wedding ring. Mrs.
Douglass deposited $10 bail and forfeited it
in the Police Court. Haehnlen demanded
a jury trial, which is set for February 17.
Mr-. Douglass was formerly Miss Jennie
Van Felt of East Oakland. She was mar
ried about eight years ago, and there is
one child living about syearsof age, which
is with its father. Mr. Douglass is said to
bj a very devout man, whose tastes are
â¢ entirely different from those of his wife,
and for a long time this incompatibility of
temper has been the cause of domestic
npleasantiiess.

First-Tear Men.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 10.â The sopho
mores defeated the freshmen this after
noon in the second baseball game of the
season at the State University, uy a score
of 25 to 17. From the very outset the
sophs were on the jump, and in the first
inning alone they scored nine runs. The
remaining points which they made were
scattered proportionately through the
other innings. Heavy batting on both
sides was a feature. Several particularly
brilliant plays were made by individual
men, but the team work did not show up
very well. Krug, at third, ana McLaren,
at short, put up decidedly the best game
for. the sophomores, and the honors for
the freshmen went by common consent to

CAUSED TWO SHOOTINGS.
Sirs. Brown of San Francisco Wag Mrs.
Marr of Oakland.
OAKLAND, Cau, Feb. 10.â Mrs. Al
berta Brown, who was the cause of her
husband, George O. Brown, shooting Wil
liam Blaisdell in San Francisco yesterday,
is well known in Oakland, where she was
Mrs. Archie Marr. A few years ago Mr.
and Mrs. Marr lived in West Oakland.
Marr was a bard-working man, fond of his
home; his wife was a handsome woman,
fond of admirers. She met G. O. Brown
at a social affair and afterward met him
frequently. On one occasion Marr sur
prised the couple and a pistol figured in
the incident.
Marr sued for a divorce and obtained it
in 1892, and the court awarded him the
four minor children, but he grieved over
his domestic troubles till his death, last
October. Soon after her divorce Mrs.
Marr married G. O. Brown and has lived
with him, apparently happily, until a few
days ago, when Brown became suspicious.
He came home unawares, caught his wife
and Blaisdell together and made good use
of his pistol.
A few months ago there was a sensa
tional fight in the Alameda courts for the
custody of the minor Marrs, and they
were eventually handed over to their
mother as their legal guardian, but she
was not permitted to handle their estate,
which is being done by Mrs. McDonald,
an aunt of tbe little ones.

not to starve, and I was actually forced
to become a burglar. I told the San Fran
cisco police when I was caught last night
that my name was John Evans and that
I came from Missouri. I will keep the
name of Evans and tell you that I came
from Kentucky, if you like to believe it.
I don't intend to say anything that will
let you know who I am or where I came
from. I realize lamin a hole, and have
made up my mind not to drag in anybody
else."
Such was the story, In brief, told by a
burglar who was arrested in San Francisco
last night and brought to Oakland this
afternoon. He is not known to the police
of either city, and they are inclined to be
lieve his story of not having stolen $1 out
side of Oakland. gÂ£S53
For several days Chief .Lloyd has bad
a special detail on the trail of Evans. The
detectives succeeded in finding a good
clew and had also recovered a good deal
of the stolen booty, and acting on the
knowledge they gained by finding out
where Evans stole bis plunder, >hey were
enabled to run bim down. Last night he
was selling some stuff across the bay,
where be had sold some on former occa
sions, and bis arrest followed.
During the past two months there have
been several burglaries In Oakland. They
were all of the same nature and were per
formed at about the same hour in the
morning in the same class of houses.
Chief Lloyd and Detective Holland went
to San Francisco to brin:; the prisoner,
and on th- way he confessed all his
crimes since he came to Oakland. At the
residence of Varney Guskill he obtained
some clothing, and at the police station
this afternoon the fashionably cut over
coat of the commander of the Republican
Alliance was put on as evidence, to ex
plain to Chief Lloyd that the reason he
had not worn it was because it was big
enough to go round about three people of
tbe size of the burglar.
Evans also entered the residence of Mrs.
Rebecca Knox, but was disturbed by a
young lady who resides there while he
was ransacking her room. He fled with a
gold watch and $10 in coin. At the house
of M. L. Levy he stole some clothing and
at the house of Charles Williams, 563 Ho
bart street, there was a personal encoun
ter. Mr. Williams got up to see what
caused the noise in the dining-room, ran
against the burglar and received a blow in
the eye, after which the burglar escaped.
A valuable mandolin, which was recov
ered to-day, was taken from the house of
Paul Lohse. Some valuable silverware
was taken from E. L. Hall's place in East
Oakland. Mrs. Garcia, at Thirteenth and
Brush, was robbed of $76 and a watch;
tbe latter has been found.
M. Schleuter suffered the loss of a watch
and money from his house, and, with the
addition of entering the house of P. E.
Bowles, on Boulevard terrace, this seems
to be the sum of Evans' crimes.
He admitted to the officers this after
noon tbat last Friday nigbt he was ar
rested by Policeman Morrison at Sixth
street and Broadway and was sentenced
to three days in jail for drunkenness. He
told the Chief that his room was at Sec
ond street and Broadway, and a search
tbis afternoon produced Varney Gasklll's
overcoat, the case of Mrs. Lohse'a mando
lin and P. E. Bowles' rubber shoes. .
James Taylor, a porch-climbing burglar,
who is under arrest in San Francisco, is
responsible for the burglaries at the resi
dences of Mrs. H. S. Cornwall, on Durant
street, and S. T. Alexander, on Sixteenth
street. The silverware taken from Corn
wall's and the jewelry taken from Alexan
der's were found in Taylor's room. This
fellow committed his burglaries by climb
ing up porch-pos ls and entering second
story windows. He is an able seaman and
an expert climber.
With these two men in the tanks Oak
landers can now retire with some degree
of confidence.
MAY NOT DRAW BOOKS.
A Sanitary Regulation Adopted by the
Alameda Library.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 10.â The library
trustees have decided to prohibit the cir
culation of books in families afflicted with
contagions diseases owing to the fact that
all medical authorities admit books are
the most efficacious means of spreading
disease germs. With this in view the
librarian sent out a number of postal
cards this week with the following printed
message upon them:
ALAMEDA FKEK LIBRARY.
No books will be issued to your family until
the Health Officer has removed quarantine.
Please notify the members ol your family
who are drawing books.
No tines imposed until after fumigation.
Respectfully yours.
J. W. Harbournk, Librarian.
This brought forth a throng of protest
ants, who besieged the library to know
why they were tabooed. D . Lubbock
furnished the names of all who have been
reported to him, and these cards are be-
Ing sent to all who are or have been tak
ing books from the library.
Banquet Postponed.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 10â The annual
banquet of the city officials, to have been
held Saturday night, has been indefinitely
postpone 1. The committee in charge â
Messrs. Forderer, Tisdale and Reynolds
met lan evening and received reports
from twenty-seven of those invited who
accepted the invitations, while three de
clined to "put up." Three of the former
will be out of town on Saturday, two are
sick, and all members of the Board of
Health are being worked incessantly and
cannot bo relied upon.
Under these circumstances it was de
cided to postpone the affair until some
later date, when measles and mumps have
left the youth of the city in peace and the
absent ones can be at home. *
Pestered by Their Notoriety.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 10.â The promi
nence given a number of prominent Ala
medans in connection with a "Midnight
Club" has brought no end of woes to
these individuals. Every, mall now brings
them letters and postal cards advertising
some "sure cure," or advising them to try
this or that. One of the latest cards an
nounces that it having come to the notice
of the correspondent that "you are inces
santly troubled with insomnia, we here
with desire to offer you permanent relief
from the same, and will give you any sort
of a guaranty that yon may require that
our emulsion will do this."

All property delinquent for taxes will be
sold on Saturday, March 6, at the Treasurer's

OPPORTUNITY FOB
A GOOD DEED
A Massive Foundation at
Bray Avenue Awaits
the Superstructure.
Like All Other Institutions Re
quiring Money, It Felt
the Hard Time?.
The Accommodation Is Needed for
the Benefit of Worthy Aged
Women.
. V-;
Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 10. f
Mansive foundations which have cost a
moderate fortune, inclosing about two
acres, have been laid on Bray avenue,
Fruitvale, and are now waiting for the
elaborate building planned by Sister Su
perior Russell of the Home of Notre
Dame of San Francisco.
The foundations were finished about a
year ago, and since that time nothing has
been done because of the insufficiency of
the fund which is being raised for the pur
pose ol establishing that institution.
Two yean ago Sister Superior Russell,
with the approval of Archbishop Riordan,
determined to make a great effort to pro
vide better and ample accommodations
for the old ladles who need to be cared
for in the evening of life. Her plan em
braces a magnificent three-story brick
structure to be located on Bray avenue.
All the details have been carefully
planned and the building will contain
comfortable apartments for many old
ladies, as well as a chapel, and it is the
intention when completed to have serv
ices celebrated in the buildine instead of
it being necessaiy for the inmates to
attend the church, which is about six
blocks distant.
Sister Russell stated at that time that
there was sufficient money in hand to
build the foundation, which is said to
have cost over $25,000, and she hoped that
by that time enough additional subscrip
tions and bequests would have been re
ceived to enable the work to be carried on.
The period of depression, which bas
reached its height since the foundation
was built, affected very materially those
who can generally be depended upon to
donate liberally for charitable purposes,
and this accounts for the fact that the
work came to a sudden standstill. Tbere
is now in hand a small portion of the
necessary fund for completing the build
ing, bnt it is not considered advisable to
go ahead until a much larger portion is
promised.
One of the most earnest advocates of the
home said to-day that if the real value of
such a home were to be known to the
people at large the necessary amount to
insure its construction would soon be
forthcoming.
"Here is an excellent opportunity," she
said, "for some wealthy individuals to
make a handsome bequest where it would
do tbe greatest amount of good. The
home in San Francisco is always full, and
its location cannot begin to compare with
this beautiful district at Fruitvale. I be
lieve when the fact becomes known that
the foundation is waiting for tbe super
structure that some material aid will
speedily be rendered."
DUPED BY THEIR FRIENDS
A Prize-Fight Eetween Two
Berkeleyans That Wasn't
a Fight.
J. C. Berry and W. Ward Pat Up a
Heavy "Josh" on a Party of
Their Sporting Friends.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 10.â All Berke
ley is laughing at a party of local sports
The Principals in the "Fake" Fight in "Which a Hundred or More
BerkeJeyites "Were Duped*
who went last night to San Francisco to
witness a fight "for blood and $50" be
tween Berry and Ward, two Berkeley box
era, who were leading lights of tbe erst
while Crescent Athletic Club.
. The two rugs bad arranged to have
some fun with friends who had been try
ing to make a match between them. They
agreed to fight. Berry to stop Ward in three
rounds, and were apparently so full of
animosity against one another that every
one looked for a bloody contest. One day
last week the two became so enraged
while discussing their coming bout in a
barber-shop that friends had to interfere
to prevent an impromptu fist fight.
.With affairs at this while heat Berke
ley's sports, who flatter themselves on
being on the inside, were active after in
vitations to see the mill, which was to
occur in some secret place in San Fran-
Cisco, where no Town Marshal and no
police could be on hand to stop the flow
of blood.
Tbe crowd, with the prospective oppo
nents in the ring, lelt Berkeley at 7 o'clock
last night. They arrived in San Fran
cisco at 8 and started for tbe secluded
rendezvous, Berry and Ward having
driven ahead in a hack.
The pugilists and their seconds turned
back and took the 8:15 boat to Oakland,
and for two long hours the leading lights
of sporting affairs in ttie university town
waited for the fighters. Then Ward's
bundle of clotbes lor the ring was opened.
In it were old vegetables and rags, and
the disgusted would-be witnesses of a truly
fight realized that they were victims of a
hoax.
A means of turning the tables by get
ting the story published as genuine
quickly suggested itself, and tbe idea was
carried out.
New Local Station.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 10.â It is prob
able that the local-train service will be ex
tended to Gilman street, West Berkeley,
which is six blocks from tbe present

matter and make a report as soon as pos
sible: William Whitney, Otto Niehaus,
Robert Stewart. H. W. Taylor, P. Monroe,
Charles Spear,' E. F. Ntehaus, E. Enge

Berkeley's Fire Chief.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 10.â A. L. Ott
of the North End was last night appointed
Fire Chief of Berkeley, having received
the indorsement of the seven companies
of tbe town. He will assume the duties of
his office at once.
This ends a long, animated struggle for
the place on the part of candidates repre
senting the four cardinal sections of the
town, a man having been named for the
place from tbe north, east, south and west
ends. '

THE ALAMEDA ESTUARY.
A. A. Cohen Will Have to Accept
Awarded Damages.
The Supreme Court has dismissed the
appeal in the case of the United States
against M. Crooks, A A. Cohen and
others. The United States brought this
action for the condemnation of a strip of
land lying between the San Leandro and
San Antonio estuaries for the purpose of
constructing a tidal canal by which to
turn the water from the San Leandro bay
into the head of the San Antonio estuary.
Three rips of land were claimed by
Cohen, who was the appellant. The Su
perior Court of Alameda County rendered
judgment in favor of the Government for
the condemnation of the entire strip, and
awarded damages to each land-owner ac
cording to his Holdings and for full value,
Cohen sought a new trial, which was
denied, and from tbis he appealed.
The Supreme Court held that the ap
peal was taken more than one year after
the entry of the judgment and, therefore,
must be dismissed.
THE HUDELSON LIBEL.
Cross-Examination of O. W. Owen Con-
eluded Yesterday.
Judge Campbell expressed his opinion
yesterday that at the present rate of prog
ress the libel suit against Benjamin F.
Hudelson, at tbe instance of Attorney
D. B. Woodworth, would not be finished
until the summer vacations. It has now
been three months in court and only two
witnesses have been examined.
The cross-examination of Q. W. Owen
by Attorney Woodworth occupied all yes
terday afternoon, and if it had not been
for the Judge putting a stop to immaterial
and irrelevant questions, it would not
have been finished in a month. Nothing
important was elicited, the questions
chiefly bearing upon conversations in Key.
Donald M. Ross' house. . Then Wood
worth began to ask Owen questions as to
bis testimony before the judiciary board
of the American Protective Association
and the Judge stopped him.
The case was continued till Wednesday
next, when the defense will put a new
witness on the stand.

WALDTEUFEL'S FEES.
Queer Complication Brought About by
the Acts of the Dead Mer
chant's Son.
Some days ago a petition was filed with
the Board of Supervisors by W. B. Brad
bury, asking tbat be might bs heard on
the subject of jury lees. The petition was
referred to the Committee on Judiciary.
Since the filing of the paper it has ap
peared that Mr. Bradbury wished to speak
concerning certain jury fees which became
due to the late Achille WaldteufeJ, the
music dealer, and which have since been
assigned to Mr. Bradbury by J. A. W'ali
teufel, a son ot Achille Waldteufel, in his
capacity of administrator. The warrant
for these jury fee-< was signed by Auditor
Broderick, but it has never been paid be
cause delinquent taxes caused it to be held
out. But for the delinquent taxes the
really interesting fact in connection with
the case might not have come out, as there
was nothine irregular on the face of the
papers. But City and County Attorney
Creswell has discovered that there is a
discrepancy in dates which needs explana
tion. The jury warrant for Achille Wald
teufel's fees was drawn November 13, 1896,
the amount being $S2. November 19, 1896,
J. A. Waldteufel made oath before F. D.
Lawler that he was the duly qualified and
acting administrator of the estate of
Achilie Waldteufel. But the record in
this respect shows that the administrator
was not appointed until January 7,1897.
This has set the City and County Attorney
to thinking. He has caused a statement
of the matter to be laid before the Judi
ciary Committee of the Supervisors. A
prosecution may result.

SUPERVISORS IN COMMITTEE OPEN THE WATER RATES INQUIRY
Resolution Adopted Conferring Upon Members Full Power to Send for Papers
and Persons Necessary to Facilitate Investigation Into
the Company's Affairs.
CHIEF ENGINEER SCHUSSLER PROCEEDS TO AN
SWER THE FIRST QUESTION RESPECTING
OPERATING EXPENSES.
He Informs the Committee That the Company Seeks to Acquire
as Much Land as Possible to Protect the Supply
From Pollution â The Next Meeting
Will Be on Monday Night.
%he Board of Supervisors in committee
of the whole devoted upward of two
hours yesterday morning to a discussion
of the affairs of the Spring Valley Water
Works Company. The information de
rived from the investigation is proposed
to enable the board to fix intelligently
and with justice, both to the company
and the consumer, the water rates for the
ensuing year. Herman F. A. Schussler,
the company's engineer, was the only wit
ness examined yesterday, and his testi
mony was by no means completed when
the committee rose shortly before 1
o'clock. Attorney W. B. Kellogg ap
peared as legal representative of the com
pany, and in speaking in its behalf as
sured the committee of its absolute will
ingness to comply with all reasonable de
mands for such information as it is able
to afford. A small public audience fol
lowed the proceedings with keen interest
throughout.
The board having assembled soon after
10 o'clock, with Mayor Phelan presiding,
the clerk called the roll, which was re
sponded to by every member except Su
pervisor Britt, who put in an appearance
a few minutes later.
Supervisor Clinton, the chairman of the
Water and Water Supply Committee,
moved the following:
Resolved, That this board resolve itself into a
committee ol the whole to investigate and ju
diciously consider the business Affairs ot the
Spring Valley Water Works as a preliminary
to fixing the water rates, as required by law,
and that the board comer upon the committee
power to send for persons and papers and all
other powers possessed by it lor these pur
poses. (Statutes of California, pages 360-361.)
The resolution was adopted, and on mo
tion of Dr. Dodge Supervisor Clinton toot
the chair.
Dr. Dodge asked if any further commu
nication had been received from the water
company, or whether any of its represen
tatives were present.
The chairman said that a recent com- j
munication from the president, addressed
to himself, stated that he would be pres
ent to afford the committee all the infor
mation asked for in the committee's letter
of the 3d inst, and any additional infor
mation required.
Attorney Kellogg here rose and informed
the committee that he was present as
counsel for the company and would be
pleased to furnish said information. The
usual procedure in such cases was for the
complaint to be made first of all, when he
would be able to deal with it.
The chairman dryly remarked that ev
ery signature to the petition now being
circulated constituted a complaint in it
self. Tbe committee at present desired the
company's representative to answer its
questions categorically. "I wish to say
here," he continued, "that the commit
tee's desire is to deal fairly by your com
pany, the customers and the City, and we
expect and believe that you will furnish
us every possible assistance."
Mr. Kellogg said that the question of
fixing rates had been before the board
ever since the adoption of the new consti
tution, and on all occasions the company
had furnished the desired information,
and not a single complaint had been made
before that anything was being kept back.
They now proposed to act in this respect
as they had acted in the past. Personally
be thought that a stenographic report of
the proceedings would be more satisfac
tory than a written statement, for which
reason there were witnesses present to
answer all the questions asked in the com
mittee's communication.
The chairman said he thought that it
would be more satisfactory to this com
mittee to have a written statement in
answer to tbese questions.
Mr. Kellogg â It would be almost im
possible to prepare a response to your let

had become very bad, two of them having

My little baby girl, when about ten months
old, was afflicted with Eczema, her limbs from
her knees down were one solid sore from

remedies which only aggravated them, before
we began the use of the Ccticcba remedies,
in which case there was a complete cure with

ter inside of two or three weeks. It will
involve practically a transcript of all our
books. We have all these details cor
rectly set down even to the smallest item
if you want them, but the same informa
tion could be communicated verbally.
All our departments have been segre
gated so that our expense account is sep
arately itemized."
Mr. Scliussler arrived at this moment
and was duly sworn as the first witness.
The chairman having called his atten
tion to the Water Committee's letter of the
3d inst., he stated he could give all such
information as was included in his de
partment, but to answer ali these ques
tions several witnesses would have to be
called.
"We claim," said the chairman, "a full
statement of expenses incurred under the
head of operating."
"Would you allow me to suggest," in
terposed Mr. Kellogg, "that it might be
more convenient to let Mr. Schussier ex
plain the various departments into which
the works are divided and afterward the
expenses ofa particular department
"Permit me to say," -aid the Mayor
with emphasis, "that I cannot see how
Mr. Schussler or anybody else can without
a prepared statement answer that first
question. I think that it is one of tbe
principal items of which we are endeavor
ing to obtain knowledge. If they propose
to Â£ive us a general statement, which is
something we do not want and which can
only be given orally, we had better under
stand it now. We want a written state
ment prepared by their bookkeeper, giv
ing an itemized and detailed account of
what constitutes operating expenses, so
that the board can verify them and ascer
tain that we are acting reasonably, justly
and economically. It seems tome that in
asking Mr. Schussler to give us a verbal
statement Mr. Kellogg is falling away
from the inquiry, It is the small items
we wish to obtain, and I would suggest
that Mr. Kellogg reconsider his proposal."
Mr. Kellogg hastened to assure the
Mayor that Mr. Schussler was prepared
with the necessary papers to give all the
details asked for, even down to a nickel,
not from his mers recollection, but from
the figures of each department.
. "I have no objection in that case," said
the Mayor.
"If his statement is not satisfactory,"
said the chairman, "we can ask tne com
pany to send us an itemized account,"
"Is it your desire?" asked Mr.Schuss
ler, "that 1 should give an approximate
idea of the works, how one department is
connected with another and how they all
work together, so that when we come to
the operating expenses you will know ex
actly where each item belongs
"I think," said Mr. Dodge, "that we are
beginning in a way likely to entail great
loss of time and that after two or three
weeks we will just find ourselves approach
ing the gist of the subject. As the Mayor
says, would it not be possible to begin the
inquiry with a partially detailed statement
as required by the statute governing this
investigation, after which we can arrive at
some determination as to what points we
require iniormation upon? Some of us
already feel that we have a general idea of
the different divisions of the plant and
the manner in which they are operated."
Supervisor Britt did not agree with the
previous speaker. "I think we should
hear a general statement from Mr. Schuss
ler," he said, "something which will serve
to guide us when we reach a stage at
which a detailed statement has to be con
sidered."
Such a course, he suggested, would
not consume a great deal of time, and
would simplify the report, and might
even show contradictions. He was per
fectly willing to hear Mr. Schussler at
this time, and considered that the com
mittee's consent was only a matter of
courtesy due to the witness.
Mr.Schussler â I am here to give you a de
tailed statement under oath, If you want
it given in writing we can have it here in
thirty minutes by telephoning the office.
You can have either.
Mr. Dodgeâ That is satisfactory to me.
I would like to have the statement put on
file, so that we may have access to it.
The witness was then allowed to pro
ceed with bis evidence, which virtually
comprised a history of the Spring Valley
Water works, from the date of his first
connection with the company, a little
over a third of a century ago, as he chose
to express it. He was the first assistant
engineer and offered various suggestions
as to how the works should be constructed.
lie became chief engineer in May, 1866,
and thereafter bad full charge of the
works. The main principles guiding him
in this capacity were an endeavor to se
cure a very large quantity of water for
this City, bocause he realized that it
would grow into a large place; that this
water should be of first-class quality ; that
the pressure should be very high and that
the price at which it could be sold should
be fair to the investors and reasonable to
the consumers. With these objects in
view the company purchased a great deal
of land and constructed reservoirs, dams
and tanks. In order to preserve the
purity of the water his aim always was to
own as much of the watershed as
possible, because in the course of his
investigations into the supply of Eastern
and European cities he had seen that the
great difficulty under which they labored
was that they had to take their water
from rivers or lakes whose source of sup
ply was from densely populated regions
up aboveâ condition of affairs which
often made it certain death to drink such
water. He determined, therefore, when
assuming control, that they would make
the water works at least equal to the beat
in the world. So the company found it
necessary to purchase a good deal of land,
both for the purpose of storing the water
and to protect the purity of the supply.
Most of this land was purchased within
twenty and thirty miles of San Francisco.
Mr. Schussler emphasized the wisdom of
this proceeding by explaining that the
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1897.
price of these lands had since risen enor
mously, and that in several instances,
when the company had postponed the
purchase, the final price exacted bad been
something exorbitant. He mentioned, as
an example, the price of $395,000 which
they had paid Alvinza Hayward for a
watershed, which they could have bought
twenty years previously for $25,000, and
had likewise agreed to furnish him 300,
--000 gallons of water a day forever.
Meanwhile the City grew and with it
the population, two circumstances tend
ing to increase the per capita consump
tion of water, for whereas in 1865 this
wax only twenty and a half gallons, in
1870 it had grown to forty and two-tenths
gallons, in 1880 to fifty-four and three
tenths, and it was now sixty-three and
four-tenths. The population had increased
in that period from 78,000 to 300,000 in
1590. Mr. Schussler added, in reply to a
question from the chairman, that this per
capita consumption included the amount
of water wasted.
The Mayor What is the per capita con
sumption of New York or Philadelphia?
Mr. Schussler â Over 100, and here it has
grown from 20 to 63. V'V %
The total daily consumption last year,
he continued, was 21.250,000 gallons. He
divided that amount by tne population of
the City, which, being estimated at 300,
--000, would give a little over 70 as the per
capita consumption. It was a well-known
MAYOR PHELAN, Who Presided Over the Investigation of the
Water-Rate Question Yesterday.
fact that as cities grew their per capita
consumption became more than propor
tionately greater. The larger per capita
consumption in the East, he explained,
was due to climate and other local condi
tions.
The Mayor wanted to know whether it
would not be possible for the company to
operate at less expense if the per capita
consumption were reduced.
Mr. Schussler did not think so.
'â¢Then what is the object of this inquiry
into the per capita consumption?" the
Mayor asked. "I notice that the waste, in
Eastern cities is 60 per cent, and in New
V rk 40 per cent. Is there such a per
centage here?"
Mr. Schusslerâ No, sir.
Any great decrease in the amount of
water wasted might, he said, result in
sewers being choked up. If the company
had a great deal of water on band ne
would not care if the consumption per
capita went up to 79 or 80. In fact he had
occasionally advised the company to take
off meters because the people were not
using enough water, and many of the
sewers were becoming choked with debris.
The increase in the consumption had
helped to make the City as healthy as it
was.
The witness then entered into the his
tory of the plant, ana specified the several
reservoirs, pumps, dams and lines which
had been constructed since 1865. The con
struction of the works at Alameda was
undertaken owing to a succession of dry
summers, which reduced the existing res
ervoir supply very considerably and this
onstruction came in time to avert a
drought in 1888. The annual production
of the peninsula varied considerably. The
figures ranged all the way from 53 per
cent retained on the surface down to 8 per
cent, so that it was difficult to estimate
correctly the average supply from these
sources. Crystal Springs could be relied
upon for an average of about 10,000,000
gallons, and that added to San Andreas
would make about 18,000,000 gallons. But
a succession of dry summers would con
siderably lower the annual production,
while a succession of wet ones would cause
the reservoirs to overflow. The maximum
production of the peninsula can be placed
at about 18.000,00 0 gallons. The Alameda
works afforded a cheaper source of sup
ply and something like 1,561,778,000 gal
lons were drawn therefrom last year. Tue
company, he stated in reply to the Mayor,
had not developed the Calaveras supply
to its full capacity because they had rea
son to fear injunctions on the part of the
land-owners. The company did not own
the whole reservoir sue near the water
sheds. They could build a dam, but
would be prevented by the people whose
land would be flooded. There was now a
large amount of water in the Crystal
Springs reservoir, but during some sea
sons of the year, when the weather was
very hot, it became highly depreciated as
regarded quality. The company could
filter it, but to do so would entail an
enormous outlay, while in addition that
supply could only be used three, four or
five months in the year, and it was, there
fore, preferable to draw the water from
the other side. The water was purified by
passing through screens of fine wire
gauze. This process removed a large ex
cess of vegetable matter with which it
became impregnated.
Supervisor Rottanzi asked for informa
tion regarding the Merced Lake supply.
The witness stated that the company
commenced to purchase land south of the
lake about the middle of January, 1895.
Ex-Mayor Sutro, however, made so much
noise about the quality ofthe water even
thirty days after the company had
stopped pumping that they ceased to ac
quire the watersheds and proceeded to
build a tunnel from the creek into the
ocean, so that they could run off all the
polluted water into the ocean direct.
They proposed also to build a canal along
side the lake and up to the creek, and he
was trying to persuade the directors to
allow him to line this canal with con
crete. In about a year and a half he
thoueht that the lake would be a very
good source of supply.
The Mayor suggested that it would be
more economical to abandon Merced.
The witness said there was no other city
like San Francisco possessing so large n
body of water right within the City and
County limits. There was enough water
in that lake to last the City for quite a
long time in case of necessity. Should a
break occur in the company's line they
could at once take water therefrom and
help out the supply; so that the City
reservoirs were always full from one
source or the other.
"To what extent," asked the Mayor,
"can the watershed be occupied witbout
impairing the purity of the supply."
The witness expressed himself as op
posed to the abandonment of any portion
of the watershed, nor would the City
think of doing so if it owned the lake.
The total acreage owned by the company
around the lake was 3637, and the com
pany paid $380,000 for the original pur
chase, or with succeeding payments about
$485,938.
The chairmanâ These 3637 acres are
necessary for the supply of the late?
The witnessâ Yes, and I am sorry we
have not more.
The chairman â Is it not a fact that the
company has admitted, by the construc
tion of . the tunnel and canal, that this
watershed is an impure source of supply?
"It was impure," replied Mr. Schussler,
"but we are going to make it pure."
The watershed was wanted because
otherwise houses might be put up on the
margin of the lake, and the introduction
of impurities could not then be avoided.
The tunnel would throw off the product
of 1025 acres into the ocean.
The Mayor thought that a quarter of a
mile belt round the lake should be suffi
cient.
The witness insisted, however, that the
present quantity was imperatively neces
sary.
Dr.. Dodge asked why so much of the
watershed was needed when the natural
filtration of water through twenty or thirty
feet of tine sand such as surrounded the
lake was admittedly better than artificial
filtration through beds of eight or ten feet?
Mr. Schussler replied that no filter had
been constructed capable of removing
chemicals such as ammonia. Alltbeland
outside tbe quarter-mile strip pitched into
the lake, and the only way to get rid of
the sewage and otber impurities coming
down from that neighborhood was as be
bad already stated. A numter of hog
ranches two or three miles away from the
lake caused many protests several years
ago.
Dr. Dodge said that, according to Mr.
Schussler's theory, it would not be safe to
use well water unless tbe land for miles
around were purchased.
The witness said there were various
kinds of wells. In almost every case
those which furnished a pure supply were
so constructed as to be impervious to sur
rounding impurities. 3: '
Dr. Dodge asked, What was at present
being done with the Lobos Creek supply?
Mr. Schussler replied that the company
abandoned this in March of 1894 or 1895
because the water was impure.
At this junctuie tbe chairman an
nounced that he had just received an
itemized statement of operating expenses,
which he instructed the clerk to read. It
is as follows:

Dr. Dodge â May I ask what that item
of $2000 for Lobos Creek is for? I think
you told us that the creek had not been
used for three or four years.
Mr. Schussler â We keep two men there
in order to prevent the land from being
jumped. One received $80 and another
$60 a month. We preserve that supply
because we know that the stream will
soon be available again. It was tem
porarily out of use owing to the unfinished
condition of the Bicnmond sewer system,
but recent analysis shows that it will
soon be sufficiently pure to use.
Dr. Dodge, discussing the ownership of
the land in the neighborhood, referred to
a case wherein, he stated, the company
had taken possession of and built upon a
certain piece the title to which was dis
puted.
Mr. Kellogg, however, said that an at
tempt had been made to steal a portion
of the company's property, of which it
had been in possession lor forty years.
Before rising Supervisor Kottanzi
moved that the water company be re
quested to provide the committee with a
statement of all properties used in the
supply of water to the City, and also a
roster of salaries paid end the persons
employed by the company. This was
carried.
It was also agreed tbat hereafter the
committee will sit every Monday, Wednes
day and Friday evenings until the investi
gation is completed.
The committee rose and reported prog
ress and the board then adjourned to
meet again next Monday evening at 7:30.
INCENDIARIES AT WORK.
Attempt to Destroy the Dwelling-
House at 1310 Howard
Street.
It Was Set On re la Two Placss
and Coal Oil Was Sprinkled
on tbe Floors.
Among the unusual number of fire
alarms Tuesday night was one for a fire at
1310 Howard street, which proved to be of
incendiary origin. The alarm was rung
from box 78 at three minutes past 9
o'clock.
When the firemen reached the house
they had to break in the doors, as no one
was at home, and it was at once seen that
firebugs had been at work. The house
had been set on fire in two places â in a
room in tbe rear and in the kitchen. The
floors and walls in each room had been
liberally sprinkled with coal oil, and the
firebug could not have left the house
many minutes before the fire waa discov
ered. ..";-
The building is a two-story frame dwell
ing, lt Is owned by A. P. Hotaling and
occupied by K. J. Leonard. The loss on
the building will amount to about $200,
and on the contents abou: $50.
Fire Marshal Towe and Detective Dillon
are investigating tbe case. Leonard's
family had been visiting some friends
Tuesday afternoon and did not return
home till 10:30 o'clock at night and the
Fire Marshal happened to be at the house
at the time.
It is not thought that the incendiarism
was actuated by any feeling of revenge,
and the Fite Marshal and detective are
seeking for another motive.
