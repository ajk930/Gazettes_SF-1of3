Strength of Samuel M. Shortridge Increasing With Every

Coming Senator.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 6.â Senator Perkins' political ship is fast break
ing to pieces on the rocks of defeat. This evening Attorney-General Fitzgerald
advised Judge Waymire that less than the number necessary to elect is not a
caucus and that those who attended the so-called caucus last night and those
who remained away were equally not bound. Judge Waymire thereupon de
clared that, in accordance with the advice of the Attorney-General, he would not
consider himself bound by the action of the fifty-nine persons present at the
so-called caucus and that he would not consider himself bound to vote for
Senator Perkins.
At a late hour this evening he had taken under advisement the matter of
bis coming out as a candidate for the Scnatorship.
The friends of Samuel M. Shortridge are jubilant over the breaking up of
Perkins' forces^ They say that the defection of Judge Waymire will be followed
by the majority of the Alameda delegation and a number of others. The excite
ment here is at fever heat.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 6â Three
men of striking personality sat this even
ing at a table in the Golden Eagie dining
room, and the crowd in the hotel office
stared and stared as the trio was seen to
be engaged in animated and earnest con
versation.
The men were making history and the
The San Francisco Call
actors were Attorney-General Fitzgerald,
Judge Way mire of Alameda and Senator
Morehouse of Santa Clara. Tney tallced
for nearly half an hour, the Attorney-
General gesticulating vigorously in that
positive way which characterizes him
when he speaks of anything which he con
siders of grave import.
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, JANUARY 7, 1897.
"MR. SPEAKER!"
At the end of the. interview Judge Way
; mire came out into the office and in
! formed a Call reporter that he had been
; advised by the Attorney-General that a
! caucus for United States Senator is a con
ference of a majority of the members 61
the Legislature, and that a conference of
i less than such majority is not a caucus,
j atid is binding neither upon those who
'attended nor those who remained away.
If, where a majority was sixty-one, sixty
memoers could constitute a caucus why
should not thirty, or ten, or even five call
a caucus and attempt to bind to its de
cision and its candidate all the rest.
The statement of the case alone is suffi
cient to prove its absurdity. Hence the
Attorney-General atvised him that he
was not bound by what was done last
nicht, even though he took part and voted
therein.
'â¢Taking the advice of Judge Fitzger
ald," said Jadge Waymire, "I do not con
sider myself bound by the caucus Oecause
there was not a majority of the Legisla
ture present. I will not be bound by it
and I will not be bound to vote for Mr.
Perkins."
Judge Waymire was tricked and in
sulted most shamefully lasc night. He
spoke of it without betraying much feel
ing, for the Judge b a cool-bended, pa
tient man, but he will remember tbs inci
dent for a long time.
"I dia not suggest the resolution recom
mending me for a Cabinet position," he
baid. "It was written at Colonel Jack
son's suggestion and in Colonel Jackson's
handwriting. He came to me, showed
me the resolution and remarked: 'Judge,
there is what we're going lo do for ycu.
Go into the caucus, and after we have
nominated a Senator we will pass this
resolution.' "
The Judge went into the caucus, cast
his vote for George C. Perkins and retired
from the room. As soon as the door
closed upon him the resolution was read.
Some one raised'a roint of order and the
chair decided that the point was well
taken, to tne effect that the caucus had
b?eu called for the purpose of nominating
a United States Senator, and for no other
purpose. The resolution was rejected and
thus the trick became a matter of history.
Going over the pround of the Perkins
disaster, the following facts are found:
The adherents of Perkins said that they
would tiave enough votes to hold a caucus,
namely sixty-one, and that tney would
get them. When this was told to Samuel
M. Shortridge, he replied:
'Gentlemen, I venture to say that you
will not bold a caucus; I make bold to say
that you will not have sixty-one votes."
The result of the alleged caucus was a
vote of sixty, as claimed by tnero, and in
this was included a proxy. The gentle
men who manipulated the affair did not
seem to be aware that there could not be
a>ny such thing ss a proxy in a Legislature
caucus, no more than any Assemblyman
or a Senator could give his proxy to some
one to vote on a bill. Consequently, ad
mitting for tbe sake of the argument that
they had sixty votes, the friends of Sena
tor Perkins failed to hold a caucus because
they had less than a majority.
Following out to its logical conclusion
the claim of W. B. Hamilton that a caucus
was held, two members of the Legislature
couid Â£o into a room and nominate a Sena
tor.
Several persons signed the call through
misrepresentation. Assemblyman Pohl
man of San Francisco, for instance, signed
it with the urderstandinz that all the San
Francisco delegation had promised to sign
it. When he found that he had been
tricked, and that he was the only San
Franciscan on the list, he had the man
hood and the courage to withdraw his
name. The loss to Mr. Perkins of Judge
Waymire's vo'e will be increased proba
bly by the loss of the greater part of the
voles of the Alameda delegation.
In reply to the question as to what
effect the candidacy of Judge Waymire
would have upon hiÂ» chances, Samuel M.
Shortridge replied:
"If lam anything of a judge of those
SANTA CLARA COUNTY'S FAVORITE SON.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 6.â A special meeting of the Republican County Central Committee was held here to-day and the following resolution was adopted:
WHEREAS, The Hon. S. 31. Shortridge, a favorite son of Santa Clara Couny, is an aspirant for the high office of United States Senator to represent
the State of California, and
WHEREAS, We, the official representatives of the Republican party in Santa Clara County, do most earnestly indorse his candidacy; therefore be it
Hetolved, That we urge our Senators and Assemblymen to. use their best endeavors in bringing about the desired resnlt.
The resolution was signed by L. A. Sage, chairman; Dr. 11. C. Brown. W. J.Kirkpatrick, E. E. Chase and Lyman Bare.
The news that Samuel M. Shortridge's chances for election to the United States Senate are very bright has caused much interest and enthusiasm in Santa Clara
County, and many leading Republicans expressed theaselves as much pleased with the outlook.
0. A. Hale, a leading business man and prominent Republican, who was a delegate to the St Ixiuis convention, is a stanch supporter oi Samuel M. Shortridge.
"1 have known Samuel M. Shortridge for many years," be said last evening. "He possesses great ability and energy and would be just the man that California
needs in the United States Senate. The people of this county look upon him ns one of our own people, and I consider it the duty of the Santa Clara County delega
tion to render turn their loyal support. If the Legislature acts for the best interests of the whole State it will elect Mr. Shortridge to the United States Senate."
"The ability and energy of Mr. Shortridge is generally known and recognized," said A. Greeninger, ex-chairman of thn Board of Supervisors. "There is no doubt
that he would fill the office of United States Senator with great credit to the people of the State, and Qe should te elected."
"I regard Samuel M. Shortridge as one of the brightest and ablest Californians, and few if any have done mere for the advancement of Republicanism in this
State," said C. M. Wooster.
"The career of Samuel M. Shortridge has shown that he is a man of undoubted ability," said County Treasurer Joseph A. Lotz. "He has the interests of the State
&t heart and the Leg^lature would make a wise choice in electing him United States Senator."
"It cannot be denied that S. M. Shortridpe is by far the ablest man whose name has been presented for the office of United States Senator," said Under-Sherill
8. G. Benson. "His election would be a credit to the State and the delegation from Santa Clara County should be unwavering in his support,"
things, if Judee Waymire goes into this
fight my chances will b? vastly improved,
that is also the opinion of my friends and
supporters, because his vote is taken away
from Mr. Perkins."
Mr. Shortridge added that if Senator
Perkins should not be elected on the first
ballot next Tuesday, an adjournment
would be taken until noon of tbe next
Jay, when one ballet would be taken. If
there should still be no choice, another
adjournment would be taken, and so on,
the object of the law beihe to allow the
legislators plenty of time for deliberation.
NOT A VALID CAUCUS.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald Makes
a Statement Concerning: the
Meetinsr Tuesday Night.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 6.âAttor
ney-General Fitzgerald made the follow
ing statement to a Call reporter at mid
night:
"Last night on my arrival at the hotel
from my office I accidentally met Judge
Waymire. The conversation naturally
turned upon the caucus which had been
held in the evening, as I understood, for
the purpose of nominating a candidate for
Senator. The matter had been very gener
ally discussed among politicians as to
whether it was a valid caucus within its po
litical meaning. I said that I had neard the
argument advanced tnat it was not a valid
caucus, for the simple reason that the
nnmber of men assembled there were not
sufficient to .accompli-h tbe purpose for
which the caucus was called. In other
wor^s, It took sixty-one men to elect a
Senator, and it seemed to me from the
arguments advanced by the gentlemen
that it was a debatable question, but my
knowledge was not of such a character as
to justify me in giving an opinion uron it.
But whether the action of tae caucus was
binding was a matter entirely with the
men themselves. They would have to be
governed by their own opinions with refer
ence to it, I think I said that every man
was the keeper of his own conscience."
WAYMIRE NOT BOUND.
Released From All Obligations to
Perkins and Jackson by Th9lr
Own Ac:s.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Jan. 6.â Judge
Waymire was asked this evening whether
he would be a candidate for the United
States senatorship. He replied:
"I have not yet said that I would be a
candidate. A seat in tne United States
Senate is, of course, something no one
could lightly turn away, but I have no de
sire to enter into a hoDeless contest, and I
am wailing for some satisfactory evidence
that the contest would be successful. If I
determine to be a candidate I will make
the announcement in time. lam advised
by my friends that Senator Perkins' con
duct toward me has absolved me from all
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
obligations to him, and they contend that
the interests of the party require that he
should be defeated. My attention has
been called to a report of an interview
with Colonel Jackson in whicn he is
quoted as saying that '"Way mire wanted
to make a dicker; that the cau
cus should indorse him for a Cabinet
position, but Jackson says he declined to
have anything to do with an arrangement
of that kind.' lam surprised that Colonel
Jackson should make such a statement as
this. It is wholly untrue that I bad any
thing to do with the resolutions indorsing
me.
''He showed me a document before I left
San Francisco containing an indorsement
of me for a Cabinet position, saying he in
tended to ask members of the Legislature
to sign it. Yesterday, some hours before
the caucus met, he showed me the resolu
tions subsequently offered to the caucus.
They were not suggested by me. They
j were in his own handwriting, and I ex
',pressed serious doubts as to the propriety
of the step, but subsequently I left the en
tire matter to Coionei Jackson and Fre
mont Older, by whose direction they were
presented to the caucus. The caucus de
clined to act on them for the reason that
it had not been called for that purpose. I
am informed that the objection was raised
by one of my own friends, and I think the
caucus acted wisely in declining to act
j upon them. All along I have entertained
1 the opinion that it is indelicate and im2
proper for either a Congressional or legis
lative caucus to advise the President
elect on such a subject. Any citizen,
of course, has a right to express his own
preference by letter or otherwise, but ac
tion Dy a caucus seems too much like
forcing things, and I doubt if it- would
have any effect oo the appointing power.
For my part, I do not desire it, but 1
should not attempt to dictate what course
my friends should pursue. The subject of
legislative enactment was suggested by
Mr. Perkins himself in a telegram to
Colonel JacKson. I would not mention
this but for the statement made by Colonel
Jackson.
"I notice a report of a statement from
Colonel Jackson, in which he gave metwc
minutes to go back into the caucus
on pain of losing my self-respect. My
recollection of the interview i 3 this: I
stepped outside the caucus to confer with
some friends a moment, and while talking
with them Colonel Jackson rushed up,
with disheveled hair, a:id made some de
mand that I should ao into caucus. I re
plied to him that I would net upon my
own judgment, without taking instructions
from him. When I had finished my in
terview I went back into the caucus. Colo
nel Jackson and I are old friends, and all
along he has claimed to be very indignant
at the conduct of Senator Perkins, and has
persistently declared that he would noi
defend him because his conduct was inde
fensible. Colonel Jacfcson's attitude in
this last matter is quite surprising to me,
and looks as if he desire d to place m,e in a
position where I would be forced to vote
against his friend. His conduct, added to
that of Senator Perkins', has released me
from all personal ana political obiigations,
and henceforth I shall do as I please."
Following is an exact copy of the reso
lution prepared by Colonel J. P. Jackson
acd offered in the Republican caucus last
night. The original in Colonel Jackson's
handwriting is in Judge Waymire's pos
session.
Whebeas. The State of California in the last
Presidential contest contributed materially to
the election of Hon. William McKinley as
President of the United States, and is the only
Republican State In the Union with as many
as nine electoral votes that has never been
honored with a Cabinet appointment; and
whereas, it is understood that the President
elect is favorably impressed toward our State
for the appointment to his Cabinet of such one
of our citizens as shall prove to De the choice
of our people for the place; now, tnerefore, be
it and it is hereby
Kesolved, By the Republican members of
the California Legislature, in caucus as
sembled at the Capitol, that we have
noted with pleasure the general trend of
public sentiment in this State in favor of
Hon. James A. Waymire for a position in the
Cabinet of the incoming President and are
impressed with the fact that the consensus of
desire on the part of both the press and the
people is that he may receive this mark oj
Presidential preference as the cnoice of the
Republican party of California; and be it
further
Resolved, That in the person of our most
worthy associate member, Hon. James A. Way
mire, we recognize a distinguished jurist and
lefrislator. well qualified for hign official posi
tion and ia all respects satisfactory as the
choice of the Republicans ol California to rep
resent the Pacific Coast under the incoming
National administration. Wherefore we re
spectfully recommend our honored lellow-citi
zen, Hon. James A. Waymire, to the favorable
consideration of President-elect McKiuley for
appointment to a position in the executive
council of the natiou.
ALAMEDA IS ANGRY.
Treatment of North That May Turn
the County's Delegation From
Perk ns.
Oakland Office ?an Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. ti. f
Much indignation was expressed to-day
among the numerous friends of Assem
blyman Hart North at the manner in
which his resolution indorsing Judze
Waymire for a Cabinet posiuon was
frowned upon at the Republican caucus
held in Sacramento last night.
Assemblyman North has always posed
a 9 an ardent supporter of Senator Perkins
and also is a stanch adherent of Judge
Waymire. Knowing of Senator Perkins'
promise of support to Waymire in the
matter of claiming for him, if possible, a
place in McKinl^y's Cabinet, Assembly
man JNorth thought he would have no
difficulty in a caucus called by Perkins'
managers of securing the indorsement of
Judge Waymire. The manner in which
the resolution was turned down on the
transparent plea of being out of order has
caused much dissatistaction in Assembly
man North's district, where he is justly
very popular. It has added one mere
element to the dissatisfaction which pre
vails locally against the manner in which
Senator Perkins breaks his political
promises.
This dissatisfaction originated in the
manner in which Perkins published an in
dorsement of Mr. H.lboru in his fight
against Judge Frick for the Congressional
nomination three months ago. After
promising that he would under no cir
cumstances take a band in the Congres
sional tight, an indorsement from him in
favor of Congressman Hilborn appeared
on the evening before the primary. This
one act destroyed nearly one-half of Per
kins' influence in this county, and the re
mainder has been seriously affected by the
treatment which his managers, by his
orders, accorded to Judge Waymire and
Assemblyman North last night.
It is openly stated by leading politicians
in the Fiftieth Assembly District, from
which Mr. North was elected, that any
instructions regarding the fight for United
States Senator cannot be considered as
binding after the manner in which Per
kins has acted toward Waymire. Much
curiosity is evinced to know why Senator
Perkins should be so anjious to see Horace
Davis indorsed for a Cabinet position, and'
the explanation is made that Perkins,
SENATOR H* V. MOREHOUSE, the Popular Representative
From San Jose*
SAMUEL M- SHORTRIDGE and His Friends in Consultation at His Headquarters.
evidently considering that he carried the
Alameda delegation in his vest pocket,
could act as treacherously toward them
as he desired with impunity, and that,
finding his strength waning, he desired
to throw down Waymire and take up
Davis, for the purpose of patching his
fences in another quarter.
Many people of this county would not
be surprised if the action of Perkins, as
carried out by his managers last nicht,
should cost him half of the delegation
from Alameda. North's popularity may
be judged from the fact that had he wanted
to have been the Senatorial candidate from
the Twenty-seventh District he could have
given Senator Stratton a lively tussle for
the nomination. He only withdrew be
cause he thought at that time when can
didates were being talked of that he could
not spare the time from his growing San
Francisco law practice to attend to Sena
torial duties, or indeed legislative duties
of any kind. He was only persuaded to
succeed himself in the Assembly when he
became convinced by his many friends
that a man with his knowledge of his dis
trict could do better at the coming session
of the Legislature than a stranger. To
turn down a man of such marked ability
and popularity was certainly far from a
wise act, and many of his supporters are
not slow to declare that Perkins has more
than destroyed any claim be may have on
Mr. North, and, indeed, the whole Ala
meda delegation.

PULLS AND' PATRONAGE.
The Democrats May Yet Lose
Control of the State
Library.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 6â Foreight
years the Domocrats have enjoyed the
patronage of the State Library, and six
years of that under Republican adminis
tration. The 'aw has been interpreted to
mean that removals cannot be made un
less the Trustees assent to a change. The
Republicans now propose to take charge
of this State institution. The term of
office of the Board of Trustees now serving
will expire in April, 1898; hence Trustees
to succeed the incumbents may be elected
by the present Legislature.
The law authorizes the Senate and As
sembly in joint convention to elect the
Trustees. The Democrats have managed
with exceeding cleverness to control the
appointment of Librarian and assistants,
and are sure to introduce some adroit
plan designed to perpetuate themselves in
power. The Republicans have gained
some knowledge by observation, and will
see to it that only men of their own party
will be chosen to manage the affairs of the
institution. The Democrats insisted in
putting the library into politics, and Hav
ing placed it there cannot object to Re
publicans following the precedent.
There is some county-division talk on
the quiet, and delegations of interested
divisionis s may come in later on. An
effort may be made to annex a slice of
Fresno County south of the river to Kings
County. The main cause In this direction
is said to be the high taxes in Fresno
County. A proposition to carve a new
county out of the territory of Tulare may
be pressed.
Members of the Legislature are inclined
to go ahead as rapidly as consistent with
the work in hand so as to get all the im
portant bills of the session in the hands of
the Governor ten days before adjourn
ment. The members will then know be
fore leaving Sacramento whether or not the
bills become laws. During the session of
the Legislature a bill in the hands of the
Governor for ten days becomes a iaw un
less he vetoes it within that time. Should
he exercise the veto power the Legisla
ture, being in session, would have the
opportunity of passing the measure over
the executive's disapproval.
TO BENEFIT IRRIGATORS.
Senator Pedlar of Fresno Proposes
to Introduce Some Needed
Amendments.
SACRASjENTO, Cal., Jan. 6.â Senator
Pedlar of Fresno will take a prominent
part in legislation for the benefit of irri
gators. There are many things in the
Wright law that are unsatisfactory to
farmers in every part of the State where
the law is in operation, and Senator Ped
One Eill That Is Certain to Receive Careful Consideration*
lar proposes to introduce a bill to amend
the law, or, if necessary, to repeal it.
There are many districts in Madera and
Fresno counties that are under the opera
tion of the act, bat the lands in and im
mediately contiguous to Fresno city are
independent of the act. The laxity with
which the bonds are issued and the pur
poses for which they are used, the arbi
trary manner in which lands but little or
not at all susceptible to the least benefit
are taken into the district and assessed
and made to bear the burden of taxation
without receiving any benefit therefrom,
have long been complained of by the
farmer. The voting is done as by stock
holders in a joint stock corporation. The
balloting on the issuance of bonds should
be left to those who absolutely have an in
terest in the property to be assessed.
"Here is the place where women should
be allowed to vota who are owners of
property. They should be allowed to have
a voice in such matters," said the Sen
ator.
He added that he proposed to introduce
an estray law that will be of interest to
stock-owners throughout the State. "I
propose to repeal everything that exists
on the subject, because the laws are so
jumbled that even a lawyer would find
them difficult to understand or to recon
cile, and it will be difficult to amend
them. Tbe easiest way to ao it will be to
repeal them and make new ones."
AMENDING ROAD LAWS.
A Movement for Batter Highways
and Better Methods of Re
pairing Them.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 6.â Alameda
County wants better highways. She does
not, however, desire to monopolize all the
eood things and is willing that the whole
State should share them with her. Sena
tor Beard of that county will at an early
date introduce a bill to make a change in
the road laws, so as to allow the road
master to be elected by the people and, to
allow road districts to issue bonds for the
purpose of obtaining funds with which to
construct substantial and permanent
roads. Many if not all the country road
districts are too poor to do anything in
tbe wav of permanent improvements, and
the cost of repairing the unscientific road
ways they now have wouid build high
ways of solid cement and concrete in
twenty years.
People have been awakened to the fact
by the researches of civil engineers that
substantial and permanent roads are much
cheaper to build and keep in repair than
the so-called cheap dirt and gravel roads,
which in tbe winter are no better than no
roads at all.
The difficulty has always been that the
districts were too poor to build decent
thoroughfares, but if they are allowed to
issue bonds to do first-class work with the
best material, the saving in horseflesh,
wagon repairs, time in transporting prod
uce from the farm to the shipping point
and in road repairs, will be sufficient to
pay off the principal and interest within
the span of a generation and at the end of
that period the road will be as good as
new.
In Europe there have been exhumed old
Roman roads ol concrete as solid to-day as
they were when first laid down a thousand
years ago.
Another feature of the Beard bill will
allow work to be done by contract in
stead of by day labor. Under the pres
ent system day labor is done by farmers
who have no practical or scientific
knowledge of road-building and who are
not properly equipped in the line of
wagons and other tools. The result is
that under such drawbacks but half a
day's work is done for the cost of one.
Under the contract system the work will
be done by persons regularly in the busi
ness and will be done in the best and most
workmanlike manner.
Senator Beard proposes also to intro
duce a law allowing unincorporated towns
and villaees of 500 population and over to
provide for laying do*rn sidewalks by the
same legal methods as are employed by
incorporated cities.
MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP.
Socialists and * Populists Will Ba
Pleased With This Innovation
In Government.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 6.â That for
which Socialists in their way and Popu
lists in their way have been striving for
year 3to accomplish will be, likely to be
effected through the instrumentality of
the Republican party, which has always
been the first to inaugurate reforms, no
matter by whom suggested. Alameda,
the banner connty of Republicanism in
this State, the county which saved the
State to McKinley, demands the fullest
and most unrestricted municipal owner
ship of those great public utilities, gas
and electric lights.
The city of Alameaa already owns her
lighting plant, and has saved many thou
sands of dollars annually to the taxpayers
on the cost of lighting streets and public
buildings. Recently, desiring to eive the
city the advantage of unrestricted owner
ship and control of tno3e public utilities,
an attempt was made to sell light to the
citizens, but an injuuction was ordered on
the application of persons interested in
the sale of gas and electricity.
In order 10 remedy any snortcomings in
the law and to allow cities and towns to
own their own water works and lighting
plants and to sell their products to the
public Senator Beard of Alameda has in
preparation a bill which, if enacted into a
law, will remove all legal obstacles. There
is no doubt tnat the bill will be bitterly
opposed by private corporations supply
ing gas fl nd electricity to the citizens, in
order to offset which opposition it will bo
necessary for the Legislature to have an
unmistakable expression of opinion from
mass-meetings, etc., in the cities and
towns.
Senator Beard expects that the measure
will receive tbe united support of the Fop
ulist members and of ail Republicans ana
Democrats of advanced ideas.
PRIMARY ELECTIONS.
In AM Likelihood the Law Will Be
Amended to Suppress All
Illegal Practices.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 6.â An ef
fort originating in several different coun
ties will be made in both houses during
the present session to amend the primary
election laws so that bosses, heelers and
tbu^s may no longer obstruct the peace
able citizen on his way to the polls.
Senators Beard and Bert will introduce
bills regulating primary elections in tbe
interest of pure politics. All the bills on
this gpbject will have similar features.
They will, for instance, provide that pri
maries shall be held under tbe Australian
ballot system, or by voting-machine,
should the use of such be legalized by thÂ«
necessary act of the Legislature. All the
bills will require the primaries of all tbe
political parties to be held on the same
day, at the same polling places and with
the same election officers.
AT THE PUBLIC CRIB.
Notwithstanding the Proposed
Economy, Expenses of Legisla
ture Will Eat Up the Taxes.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Jan. 6.â To-day
the general fund of the treasury of thÂ«
State of California contains more than
three million dollars. The general fund
is the barrel which members ol the Legis- ,
lature are authorized to tap with appro
priation bills. Yesterday San Francisco,
through Treasurer Widber, paid into the
State Treasury $1,200,000. The sum of
$600,000 was at once apportioned to the
general fund. The school fund secured
$600,000 and the rest was apportioned to
various other funds.
It has been suggested that the members
of the Legislature from the interior cities
and rural districts should constantly bear
in mind that this sum of $1,2C0,000 has
been wrung by the tax-gatherer from tho
toilers and home-owners in San Francisco
who have saved and pinched to get to
gether tne money to pay their taxes. In
many instances families have had to sur
render objects of comfort desired in order
to contribute to the support of the S:ate
government. The fruits of their industry
are represented in this sum of $1,200,000,
which Treasurer Widber paid over yester
day. It is therefore suggested that the
utmost care should be paid to all appro
priated measures, so that the money
taken by law from the industrial classes
should not be squandered or given oui n
salaries to maintain a clas3 of gilt-edged'
loafers.
In many places talk is cheap, but in the
Legislature talk costs something. While
the orator is soaring into lofty realms of
eloquence in the cause of retrenchment
and reform, the taxpayers are paying for
the light, fuel and attendance of the whole
Legislature. Talu prolongs the session
and ultimately costs more than a small
array of attaches.
One hundred and three bills have been
introduced in the Assembly. Appropria
tions of every kind and description are
included. While the Assembly is talking
economy preparations are in progress for
a great assault on the treasury. Never
was there a bigger sacK of coin inimerii

Weak Men and Womenately available, hence the raid will be
tard to resist. Speaker Coombs may
tally the reform forces, but should the
Assemblymen representing counties in
which public institutions are established,
together with members from counties ask
ing for the establishment of State institu
tions, decide to pool their issues the raid
would surely become formidable. Ala
meda, Santa Clara, San Joaquin, Napa,
Sacramento, Marin, Mendocino, Butte,
San Bernardino, Los Angeles, Amador
and Sonoma have public institutions re
spectively, and San Diego has entered the
list, asking for a branch of the State Nor
r.i3..
A scheme has been planned on behalf of
the State University to obtain a half
million from the Legislature. The exist
ing levy of 1 cent on the $100 may be in
creased to 2 cents. This increase would
permit the university to draw for main
tenance 5250.000 per annum, with the
amount increasing as the assessment roll
expands. Some members of the Legisla
ture may perceive the danger of passing a
law compelling the State Board of Equali
zation to levy a fixed sum per annum for |
the support of any State institution.
Tne Assembly held a brief session this
morning. More bills were introduced un
til the number reached 103. After ad
journment for the day the Assemblymen
caucused on the subject of increasing the
patronage list. It was agreed in caucus
that the San Francisco delegation and the
Democratic minority in the Assembly
should each hire a clerk and sergeant-at- !
arms. The forty-two standing committees
. as follows were agreed upon:

Colonel Barry's Mission.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 6.-Colonel
T. F. Barry of San Francisco arrived to
night as the representative of the com- i
mitted of fifty citizens ;o support the
resolutions in tbe Legislature opposing
the funding biii in Congress, He states
t at they are not so much opposed to the
Caminetti clause as they are to the propo
sition favoring Government ownership.
He will stay until the resolutions arÂ«
adopted and forwarded.
STRUGGLES IN OTHER STATES.
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, South
Dakota and Colorado to Elect
Senators.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Jan. 6.-The Sen
ate and House of .Representatives, consti- I
tuting the Fortieth Assembly of Illinois, i
were opened to-day and both bodies were ;
organized accordins to the previous de- i
c:s.or.s of the majority party in caucus.
All ihe incoming State officers were
present, excepting Governor-elect Tanner, :
and the Capitol was tilled with men and j
women from all parts of the State. There
was not even standing room left in the
lobbies of Representatives' Hall when
Secretary of State Hinricbsen caJled the"
House to order at noon. Tbe temporary
officers chcsen by the caucus were in
stalled and the oath of office administered
to the members. E. C. Curtis was elected
Speaker on a sirictly party vote. A com
mittee was sent to wait on Governor Alt
geld and notify him tbe House was ready
to receive any communication from him.
He responded with his last message to the
Legislature, which was read in both
houses before adjournment.
Lieutenant-Governor Joseph Gill called
the members of the Senate to order, and
by his side was Lieatenant-Governor-elect
Nortbcott, who was there to get pointers
ca the duties of a presiding officer. Jus
tice Magruder of the Supreme Court ad
ministered the oath of office, and pending
â the inauguration of the new State officers
nest Monday a temporary presiding offi
cer was chosen, as well as other officers,
according to yesterday's caucus. After
receiving the Governor's message the Sen
ate adjourned until to-morrow.
It is the general talk that practically no
further work in connection with the Â»aa
toraaip will be done this week. The party
leaders have left town, having arranged
the organization of the House, and will
not return until Sunday night. Mean
while the Senatorial candidates, Madden,
Mason, Hitt, Carr and Allerton, remain
on the ground to see that no advantage is
gained over each other. Speaker Curtis
said he had no opinion to express as to
the Senatorial aspirants, adding: "It is
my intention to organize the House as
though there was no Senator to be chosen
this winter. I shall certainly not use my
position to advance or retard anybody's
chances.'*
INDIANAPOLIS, In, Jan. 6. âThe
separate Republican caucuses of the Legis
lature which met to-night showed the
followers of C. W. Fairbanks in complete
control ol each caucus. The caucus nomi
nees were made independent of Senatorial
influences, though it happened that all of
them were friends of Fairbanks. The
Senatorial tests came on upon appoint
ment of a conference to fix the time for
holding the joint caucus to nominate a
Senator. Every member of this com
mittee of six was a Fairbanks man. After
listening to arguments for a late caucus,
from representatives of General Wallace
and R. W. MoKerr, the committee voted
down a motion to hold the Plowman and
Goodykoontz forces. Calvin has made
a written statement that a rumor afloat a
few days ago that he was tne candidate of
the Kyle forces, is untrue" and were started
without his knowledge, and he would, in
fact, support Goodykoontz until a caucus
nomination is made and then he would
support the nominee, whoever he may be.
It is positively asserted that such a written
statement was signert by Colvin and that
had it not been for tnat, the anti Ky,e
forces would nave combined to defeat him.
It is certain that Colvin has openly
announced himself for Goodykoontz and
will support him to the end unless he
should fail to get the caucus nomination.
LANSING, Mich., Jan. tiâ The Legisla
ture, which commenced its session to-day,
promises to attract public attention in
proportion as Governor Pingree may en
deavor to engraft upon it his pet meas
ures. The fighting Governor has already
given out that he proposes to be a regular
"smasher" and that it will not be his
fault if the present session is not pro
ductive of some radical legislation.
Among the pet measures that he proposes
to push is one providing for 2-cent fares
on all the railroads of the lower peninsula;
another for submitting to popular vote
the granting of street railroad and other
franchises, in order to cnect corruption
among Aldermen and city officials; an
other to suppress trusts and monopolies
and to prevent over-capitalization of cor
porations; still another to prevent the co
ercion of voiers, and a tinal one providing
for the taxation of railroad property on
the same basis as other properties.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., Jan. 6.â The
Legi-iature that met to-day will re-elact
United States Senator Vest to succeed
himself for a fourth term. There is no
opposition to him in the ranks of bi3 own
party. Senator Cockrell iÂ« also in the
midst of his fourth term and it is under
stood will not beacaudidate lor re-elec
tion again. It is an interesting fact that
only once in the history of Missouri has
one man been c ected Senator five times.
This was Thomas H. Benton, who sat in
the Senate for thirty years.
The L?gisJature will be a-ked to create a
Slate Board of Charities and Correction to
supervise the charitable and criminal in
stitutions of the State, to inaugurate ;easi
b!e plans for tne improvement of public
roads and to Da>s a la;* vii lzing the labor
of ao.e- bodied unfortunates and providing
for tiÂ»e control of tramps, paupers and
youthful dependents.
JfIERRE. S. Dak., Jan. 6. â Enough
members of the lower branch ot the Legis
! lature have arrived to-day to form a
[ quorum and organize. The fusion forces
had a majority of those presen;, but not
oi all the members-elect. Snow blockades
still prevent the absentees from reaching
the city. John Ccuvin of Mitchell was
cbosen Speaker.
The Senatorial question i?, of course, the
chief center of excitement. Now that
i both houses are organized and ready for
I business this question will attract es-en
| more attention.
Besides the newspaper men there were
present several persons who are supposed
to have gone on the vessel on the last rrip
and other persons who saw her being
loaded at Fernandina before she left. All
of the witnesses say that they know noth
ing about the alleged arms ana fitting-out
of the vessel.
DENVER, Colo., Jan. 6.â Both houses
of the eleventh General Assembly con
vened at noon to-day and effected an or
ganization. A combination of National
Silverites, Populists and McKinley Re
publicans controls both houses and it is
believed insures the election of Teller to
the United States Senate.
ALBANY. N. V., Jan. 6.â The State
Legislature met at 11 o'cloct this
morning to organize for at least a lour
months' session. The Governor's annual
message was read in both nouses at noon.
The Senate 'had little to do in the way
of organ zation, as the Republican Sena
torial caucus last night determined to lei
the Senators have the same patronage as
last year.
Both houses adjourned before 1 o'clock
until next Wednesday evening in order to
give Speaker O'Grady time for the prep
aration of his standing committees, which
will be announced then.
SOUTH CA.JH/Ll* -t JiOM> CAsE.
Decision Merer* rd by the Maryland
Court of Appeal*.
ANNAPOLIS, Mb., Jan. 6.â Court
of Appeals yesterday reversed the decision
of the court below in the celebrated South
Carolina bond case. The suit grew out of
; a dispute between T. Edward Hambleton
| & Co. and other Baitiiuoreans of New
York and Colin Rhond of Georgia and a
banker named Lancaster or New York
i and Richmond over a division of commis
j sions for Hoating-a bond issue of the State
of South Carolina.
In 1Â£96 Rbond obtained authority from
the authorities of South Carolina to float
$6,000,000 State bonds. He applied to
Lancaster for aid in 'forming a syndicate
to take them. Lancaster was unable to
float the entire issue and Hambleton &
Co. were appealed to. It was agreed that
all subscribers should share alike in the
profits of the transaction.
After the bond issue Lancaster and
Rbond, it is alleged, entered into a secret
agreement, whereby two-thirds of the in
terest due on July 1, 1893, should be paid
to Lancaster "to pay syndicate expenses,"
which, it was hinted, was political in
fluence. This, if the whole of the issue
were considered, would amount to more
than $118,000.
The court holds that the syndicate had
a right to know what these expenses were,
and says â¢ that Lancaster not only sup
pressed toe truth, but in his testimony de
liberately uttered the most unblushing
falsehoods. The court finds against the
claim of Rhond thai Lancaster was enti
tled to this two-thirds interest and re
quires Rhond to pay over $26,250, ; with
interest and costs, to the appellant. i1 r ;

ONE HUNDREDTH
ANNIVERSARY
Albany City Celebrates the
Establishment of the
Capital.
Pretty Sentiments Expressed in
Letters From the President
and President-Elect
Mejor McKiney Looks With Pride
Upon New York as the
Emp re State.
ALBANY, N. V., Jan. 6.â The hun
dredth anniversary of the establishment
ol the State capital at Albany was appro
priately celebrated to-day.
Governor Black was presiding officer.
Letters of regret were read from Governor
Morton, who had been named to deliver
the opening address, and irom President
Cleveland and President-elect McKinley.
Major McKinley in his letter of regret
said in part:
"While I yield to no one in affection and
loyalty for my own Btate, yet I, with the
people of tt.e Nation, lcok with peculiar
pride upo/i New York as the great ' Empire
State' of the Union. New York can well
be proud of tbe historic position she occu
pies in the constellation of States. I con
gratulate both the city and the people,
and send cheerful greetings of a citizen of
a sister Siate which shares in yonr pride
in the past, in your exultation in the pres
ent, ana in your hopes for the future."
Tbe historical address of tbe day was
made by Gfaauncey M. Depew. His re
marks were well received by an apprecia
tive audience of over 5000, who crowded
the hall.
William H. McEloy read a commemora
tive poem, and the Right Rev. William
Croswell, Episcopal Bishop of Albany,
brought the exercises to a close with a
benediction. The following letter of re
gret was received from President Cleve
land:
Executive Mansion-, (
Washington, I), c, Jan. 4. 1897. J
Hon. John Boyd Thacher Dear Sib: I sin
cerely regret that the many official duties do
not permit me to join my friends in Aloany
on the 6th inst. as a participant in their cen
tennial celebration. The years spent in your
city while I discharged official da ties
left on my mind the clear conviction that no
mistake was made when Albany was fixed
upon as the seat of government for the great
State of New York, to be always thereafter
associated with its glory ana its prestige.
During my stay among the good people of
Albany I gathered in many delightful remem
brances. You may be sure, therefore, that
though atsen.t I shall on the day of your cele
bration remember with ceremonious gratifica
tion my proposed participation in the exer
cises at tnis particular capital, and pleasutabiy
recall the discharge of important and laborious
puDlic duties made more easy by the greater
hospitality of its &eoj.le. Very truly yourg,
Geoveb Cleveland.
A State ball was held this evening.
THRIFTY AMERICAN SYNDICATE.
Concluding Arrangements to Monopolize
the Railroad, Telegraph and Telephone
Systems of China.
NEW YORK, H. V., Jan. 6.â Senator
Calvin S. Brice, at the head of a syndicate
of United States officeholders and capi
talists, has nearly concluded arrange
ments for the establishment of a mono
poly of tbe railroad, telephone and tele
graph systems of China. Ex-United
States Senator William D. Wash burn of
Minnesota and Clarence Cary, an at
torney of Wall street, this city, are now
in China as representatives of the syndi
cate. With them is Mr. Bach, a promoter
formerly living in Washington, but who
for some years has been in China, where
he has great influence with tbe officials
of the Government.
The preliminary arrangements have
been made with the utmost secrecy, and
only thÂ« mo?t intimate friends of Mr.
Cary and ex-Senator Washburn were told
of their destination when the two men
left this city just before Thanksgiving day.
The negotiations for this huge monopoly
were made while Li Huns Chang was in
this country. By their official connection
with the Government some of tha mem
ber* of the syndicate were abie io get
much closer to him than was possible to
tne ordinary citizen.
Only one serious obstacle stands in the
way of the success of the work. Ttis
obstacle is tbe opposition of the Russian
Government, which has instructed it*
representative at Peking to do his utmost
to force tbe Chinese Government to defer
the final signing of the contracts. One
contract wiil be for a line of railroad from
Hankow to some point within a few miles
of Peking. Tbe latter city is not a treaty
port, and consequently it is not permissi
ble for a railroad to come directly to it.
From Hankow to Peking is a distance
of a little more than 700 mile?, and at tbe
rates usual in this country, the profit
arising from the contract woiud be great.
But things are managed differently in
China and the members of the syndicate
expect to make severai timea the usual
profit by the deal. They figure out that
they are perfectly justified in chargine
the Chinese ten times the price for his
railroad, for they say no matter how
much it costs him, the uenerit arising from
it will be vastly greater. Tbe members
of the syndicate also want the sole control
of the telegraph and telephone systems,
and incidentally of the banks.
Senator Brice left the city yesterday for
Washington and could not be seen in re
eard to the plans of the syndicate. E. R.
Leiand, I is confidential man, was found
at Li is office in Broadway and admitted
that the story was substantially true.
BLISS' LIPS ARE SEALED.
: Declines to JUtruf the JttÃuli of His
Sleeting McKinley.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. Cornelius
N. ' Bliss, who returned yesterday from
Cleveland, Ohio, where he met President
elect McKinley by appointment at the
house of Mark H anna, said to-day:
"I had been intending to call on Major
McKinley ever since the election. A month
ago I expected to meet him in Cleveland,
but was unable to get away from home.
This time I was able to get away, and we
had a very pleasant talk together. We
talked of various matters, bin my lips are
sealed; as to what passed between us, I
can positively say nothing about our con
versation." , ; , :
Some time ago it was announced that
Mr. Biiss nad been selected for the navy
portfolio in President McKinlcy's Cabi
net. A report from Cleveland says that
wnile tnere Mr. Bliss agreed to accept the
place. He declined io discuss this report
to-day.

RESCUED FROM TREE TOPS.
Perilous Plight of an Army of Wood

ST. LOUIS, Mo., Jan. 6.â Early this
morning the steamboat Pike landed here
sixty woodchoppers that had been picked
irom the tree tops and house roofs in tbe
lowlands north of Louisiana, Mo., yes
terday.
Two hundred woodchoppers employed
by local labor concerns were at work on
the prairie-lanas bordering on the Missis
sippi lying directly north of Louisiana.
The place has been studded with tents.
The men and their families have camped
there for the past month. Tbe Mississippi
had been rising rapidly, but no immediate
danger was expected.
Early Tuesday Salt River, directly
north, rose three feet, breaking over its
banks and flooding the lowlands.
Joseph Lowler of St. Louis, a section
foreman, foresaw the danger, but arrived
at the woodchoppers' camp too late for
them to escape. He was astride a horse.
Following him came the roaring of the
waters. There was a rush for the highest
point, and those fortunate enough to have
cabins sought safety on the roofs.
The narrow strips of high land were
covered with shivering humanity. The
night was well advanced, but bonfires on
the highlands kept the woodchoppers
from freezing until daylight, when they
were rescued with skiffs and rafts. The
Pike picked up many of them.
At Reading Switch, four miles north, at
the mouth of Salt River, the whole land
for miles around is under water. The St.
Loui-% Keokuk and Northwestern Railroad
tracks were submerged. There is danger
of the railroad bridge across Salt River
being swept away.
This morning two expeditions left
Louisiana â one north and the other
south â on a search for flood victims.
Mayor Hart leads in the movement and
has started a fund to defray expenses.
Three St. Louis and San Francisco
passenger trains are held near Su Clair,
Mo., by a washout.
One of the trains was due in St. Louis
yesterday morning, another last night
and trie third this morning. The officials
are unable to tell when they will be able
to bring their trains into St. Louis, but
tney expect to do so some time to-night.
More than 900 feet of track has been
washed away by the rise of the Meramec
River.
A large force of men has been at work
day and night since the washout repair
ing the break. Much dissatisfaction is
prevailing among the passengers, wno are
eager to reach St. Loui.Â«. The washout 'v
fifty miles from St. Louis.
The Missouri River and its tributaries,
the Ojage and the Gasconade, are falling,
as is also the Mississippi above Grafton,

RISE OF IME MISSISSIPPI.
Greatest Consternation and Hardship
I'rtrails Along the River.
ST. LOUIS. Mo., Jan. 6 âThe rise in the
Mississippi River continues at a rate of
nearly an inch per hour.
River men predict tnat the flood will go
to 27 feet. It is feared that an immense
loss to property will result. Two hun
dred people a;c n a the river banks passed
Monday niaht some in trees and otners
on cabin roof*.
The greatest terror ar:d hardship pre
vail-. Relief is being given the sufferers
as speedily as possible, but just at present
very little can be done. Tne rise was en

SEVEN PERISH
IN A CONVENT
Fire Destroys an Ursuline
Cloister in a Quebec
Village.
Heroic Sisters Sacrifice Their
Lives in Giving Warning
to Others.
Their Eoiies Found in Attitude of
Prayer Where They Succumbed
to the Flames.
ROBERVAL, Quebec, Jan. 6. â Fire
broke out in the chapel of the convent
here at 6 o'clock this morning, caused by
a lighted candle near the Cradle of the
Infant Jesus, setting fire to the draperies
and floral ornaments, and in an instant
the whole was a mass of flames. The
alarm was given by a sacristy man, but
the fire spread with such rapidity that
nothing could oe done to save the build
ing.
Seven nuns were smothered in the
smoke. Their names are:
Mother St. Francois de Paul (Elise Gos
seiin of St Jean Chrysostome).
Sister Providence (Emma La Tourneau
of Quebec).
Sister Ursule (Corinthe Garneau of St
Foye).
Sister Anne (Laura Pudon of Herbet
ville).
Sister Antione de Padorc (Catherine
Bouille of Deschambault).
Sister St. Dominique (Marie Louise Gi
rard of Roberval).
Sister St. Louis (Rose Gosselin of St.
Chrysostome).
A man was badly burned in try
ing to extinguish the fire. The convent
and schools are a mass of ruins. The total
loss is $75,000, with only about $12,000 in
surance.
The convent burned was that of Our
Lady of Lake St. John, in charge of the
Ursuline sisters, a cloister order and one
of the oldest sisterhoods in Canada.
Usually there ara about fifty young ladies
in attendance at the school, besides the
nuns and the other attaches of the estab
lishment, making in ail about 100 inmates.
Most oi the students, however, were away
for the holidays.
"When the alarm was given the nuns
bravely undertook the task of rescuing
those in their charge, and in this heroic
task those who perished gave up their
lives.
From floor to floor of the doomed build
ing these Christian devotees rushed,
through blinding smoke and lurid flames,
sounding the alarm; and not until every
one in their charge was warned of the
danger and safely out of the building did
they turn to saving their own lives. It
was then too iate, and, overcome by the
heat and smoke, seven of these heroic
bisters gave up their lives.
Having seen tbeir charges reach a place
of safÃty tbey endeavored to save â¦.hem
selves, bat their escape was cut off, and
they were not even able to reach windows
from which to jump and take their chances
in a leap for life. On every floor their
bodies were found, some burned terribly
and those of others who had been suffo
cated to death kneeling in the attitude oi
prayer.
Those who escaped are being well cared
for at the hotels and private residences of
the vil.age, the doors of which were
thrown open to them in their distress. So
far as known none of the scholars who did
not go to their homes for the Christmas
and New Year vacation are missing, and
it is believed the seven names given here
tofore comprise the total fatalities.
This village is about twenty milas north
of Quebec City and rests on the eastern
shore of Lake St. John.
RELIGIOUS STRIFE IN CANADA.
The "Patriotic Vigilance Committee" of
Ontario Issues a Confidential Circular
to Protestant Clergymen.
TORONTO, Oxt., Jan. aâ The Globe to
day publishes a circular which it says has
been sent to Protestant clergymen and
leading citizens throughout Ontario. The
circular is dated Ontario, December 29.
1896, is headed "Patriotic Vigilance Com
mittee" and marked "Confidential," and
begins as follows:
The gravity of the crisis brought upon the
country by the result of the elections of June
last and the encouragement thereby given to
the dis'.oyal elements of our population have
caused the formation of a patriotic vigi
lance committee by a, few citizens determined
to maintain by all means in their power the
honor and integrity of the. British flag and
dominion in Canada.
Proceeding it says:
An insidious conspiracy has for several
months been at work throughout the Domin
ion, aiming at the overthrow of the authority
of our gracious sovereign, ihÂ« Queen, and
others, and the annexation of our beloved
country to the United States. Behind what is
ostensibly a political movement is plainly to
be seen the hand of the Roman Catholic
churcn, ever watchful of Protestant liberty.
While several members of the present Gov
ernment are known to be thoroughly and
sincerely Soya!, the fact that the government
of Mr. Laurier owes its majority to the dis
loyal element does not hold out the hope that
they can successfully cope with the crisis in
which we are.
The committee therefore calls for the organ
ization in every district ot patriotic vigilance
committees to ascertain and record the views
of all wnom there is reasonable ground for
suspecting of being in sympathy with the
movement, and to take such steps as may sug
gest themselves to check their further spread
and manifestation.

LONDON, Exg. , Jan. 6.â At the dinner
of the Article Ciub, given at the Hotel

"The American People."
He referred incidentally to Canada, in
the growth of he declared there
wa3 nothing that ought not to awaken the
sympathy, pride and pleasare of the citi
zens of the United Slates.
Although it might be that some senti
ment seemed to stand between the hearts
of the British and American people, he
was assured, he said, that the sentiments
actuating the best men in England were
identical with those actuating the same
class in the United States and he was re
joiced that he had been permitted to serve
as the ambassador of the United States to
Great Britain.
He camÂ« from a friendly country to a
friendly country and would nave been
falÂ«e to his duty if he had not spoken in
the voice of a friend, by doing which,
however, he had evoked the displeasure of
some persons. For tnis, Mr. Bayard said
he was sorry in one sense and not sorry in
another sense. [Laughter and cheers. 1
If darts fatal to his own country and to
that of his hearers had been attracted to
himself, he was grateful for the distinc
tion ; and if a man was to be censured for
fidelity to the cause of amity of nations
between whom he was supposed to act as
a friendly envoy, he whs rather to be con
gratulated than condemned. [Cheers.]
In concluding his remarks Mr. Bayard
said: "It is in no poor weak spirit o; de
fiance, but rather in a Â»edate, well-consid
ered spirit of gratitude, that 1 reflect that
in performing my international duty I
Have done sometmng to bring the hearts
and hands of our peoples closer together.
[Loud cheers ]
"In that refaction is my reward. It is
mine and belongs to me. I brought it
here and shall carry it away and keep it
wherever I go."
Mr. Bayard's remarks were concluded
amid loud and prolonged applause.

THE SICK
ARE CURED.
The Depression Caused by
Disease Is Dispelled.
Â« ' â  â __
DISEASES. ESPECIALLY THOSE OF
J-' a chronic nature, cannot be cured ex-
cept by a treatment that strikes directly
at the root of the trouble. The new, origi-
nal and marvelous method of treating dis-
eases mat is pursued at the State Electro-
Medical Institute is one that never fails.
The salutary effects of the treatment on
any disease are at once perceived and a
speedy and permanent cure is invariably
made in every case.
The treatment is medical and electrical
combined. The peculiar method of ad-
ministering these two great curative reme-
dies is a new, original, scientific discovery
of the Institute. It is used exclusively by
them and the most amazing results are
accomplished in the treatment and cure of
all diseases.
The Institute is splendidly equipped
with every device known to the scientific
world for administering medical electric-
ity, including large Static, Faradic and
Galvanic batteries. Electric Beits, Body
Batteries and a great variety of other
electric appliances that are manufactured
and used exclusively by the Institute in
their Electro-Medical . treatment. By
means of tnese electric batteries and ap-
pliances, vitalizing, life-giving electric
currents are used to aid in sending the
Institute medicines directly to the dis-
eased organs and diseased parts of the
body.
The medicines prescribed at the Insti-
tute are perfect laboratory triumphs, for-
mulated from a true appreciation of the
medicinal wants of the body; and when
these medicines are â¢ aided in their recu-
perating and healing work by electricity
scientifically applied, every symptom of
disease is rapidly ais pel led, the patient
soon regains perfect health and strength,
while the depression caused by disease ii
displaced by the happiness and pleasure
that is the natural heritage of those twin
blessings, "a sound mind in a sound
body."
It you are sick or ailing, if you want to
know what id tne matter with" you, and if
you want to be cured, you should resort
without delar to the State Electro- Medical
Institute. The Institute IKE ATS AND

FAILS TO PROVE
REINHART GUILTY
Government Loses Its Case
Against the Santa Fe's
Ex-President.
Acquitted of Complicity in the
Giving of Rebates on
Freight.
Witness?s en Whom tie Prosecut'on
Relied Testified for the
.Accuse!
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 6.â A nolle prosse
was entered to-day in the case of Joseph
W. Rein hart, ex-president of the Santa Fe
Railroad Company, who was charged with
being inculpated in giving rebates on
freight rates, and Judge Grosscup ordered
him discharged from custody at once.
The Government failed utterly to prove
thnt Mr. Reiuhart knew anything of the
alleged transactions.
In the case of Hanley, the ex-general
traffic manarrpr, the District Atto r ney,
General Black, admitted that evidence
nece-sary to ccmplete the proof could not I
be introciuco'l, because the witnesses
were absent and he suspected they would
come only "by slow freight."
The Government relied on W. P.
Jenkins, manager of Jhe Hammond Pack
ing Comratiy, and Isaac Thompson, the
Kansas City livestock shipper, to corrobo
rate the testimony of John G. Taylor, the j
<>x-livestock ;i{;ent of the Santa Fe, as to i
receiving the illegal rebate money by or
der of Hanley. As witnesses for tne
Government both these men weakened |
the testimony of Taylor, and the prospcu- j
tion having closed except for proof of the
railroad's incorporation, Hanley expects
to be discharged to-morrow.
Jenkins flatly contradicted Taylor. He
said he was in no sense a representative
of the Hammond Company to treat on re
bates, but was sent by some official of the
company, whose name he could not re
call, to receive some ruoncy from the rail
road company. He went to Hanley's
office, but saw oniy Taylor, from whom he
received about $300.). acting solely as a
messenger. He did not know what the
payment represented, and Hanley, whom
lie saw afterward, did not mention the
transaction.
Thoinp on could â  not remember any
thing about his transaclion in Himley's
office of interest to the Government. He
remembered only that he called to collect
some damage churns, and he wns sure that

President Ripley, G nera! An Hfor Her
bert C. Whit-head ami Freis'it Trallic
Manager Biddle of the Santa Fe, were in
court at the afternoon session. Mr. White
head, as ordered by the court, brought
with him copy books of the bills of lading
for the Kansas City livestock shipments
in 1592, but on objection of the defense the
court refused to allow the books to be in
troduced as evidence. None of the Santa
Fe officials could identify the books.
Judge Grosscup said at the beginning of
the trial that the waybills and any other
documents of shipments were the best
proof of rate-cutting, but the Government
had not proved that any livestock was
shipped upon which rebates were paid.
The court reminded the Government
that the railroad company was not on
trial, buc only ex-offioerÂ«.
\\ hen the nolle prosse was entered by
General Black Senator Duncan, attorney
lor Rinehart. indignantly protested
against the action of Senator Shields,
special attorney for the Interstate Com
merce Commission, in having his client
held over since last spring without a scin
tilla of evidence, to which Mr. Shields re
torted that the failure to convict was no
fault of his and there were reasons which
he did not wish to assert now.
SWELL SWINDLER CAPTURED.
Moved in Exclusive Soceiy and Conducted
His Operations on an Elaborate
Scale.
OMAHA, Nebr., Jan. 6.â Acting at the
request of the Sheriff of Belleville, 111.,
the police to-day arrested S. J. Gordon,
alias C. M. Anderson, on the charge of
scheming to defraud through the mail?.
It is alleged that Gordon is a professional
swindler and that his field of operation is
not alone confined to this country.
Gordon oame to Omaha a week ago and
registered at one of the very best family
betels in the city. His affable manners
and surroundings gave him the oppor
tunity of meeting some of the best fami
lies in the city. At the time of his arrest
be had two society belles of the city so
liciting in his behalf. He opened an
office and asserted that he had in mind
the starting of a paper devoted to science,
art and literature. A brilliant prospectus
was prepared. Ha represented himself as
the correspondent of the London Times
and Telegraph.
Gordon advertised for a clerk, collector,
doorboy and also a partner. He received
numerous applications, all of which he ac
cept ci, engaging everybody making
application â at least those who were will
ing to put up cash bonds for the faithful
performance of their duties.
The authorities bad a letter from the
Fheriff at Belleville, 111., several days sgo
stating that a notorious confidence man
named C. M. Anderson had recently es
caped from the chain gang and had located
in Omaha, where he was about lo swindle
a woman out of $200. Detectives were
placed on watch 'at the postofnee, but
Anderson chanced his name to Gordon
and sent a messenger- boy after his mail.
Thus he evaded the Omaha officers until
to-day.
Gordon's scheme was to employ a person,
then require him to put up a cash bond,
and to abscond before the first issue of the
paper. This paper was to appear January
15. This was his scheme at Belleville,
111., for which he was put on the chain
Bang.
BZOODSHEJt MAY JtESULT.
A. JtuaineiM Misunderstanding Which
May End in a Duel.
SUPERIOR, Wis., Jan. 6.â Bloodshed
may be the result of a misunderstanding
between two prominent men of this city.
The parties are Colonel CD. Louu, who is
here .from. Savannah, Ga., and W. J.
Holden, a local shipbuilder and politician.
Colonel Loud is engaged in encouraging
immigration to the fruit sections of Geor
gia. Holden was -tent with the colonel a
short time ago to Georgia by""a party of
shipyard men to look over the country. * .'
While away Holden conceived > the idea
of going into business himself, and started
a rival business three miles from Colonel
Loud's land. The colonel demanded an
explanation, and gotHolden outone night
to cowhide him, but the latter escaped in
the darkness. Both men were arrested.
The quarrel has been carried to this
city, and Load threatened to either "cow
hi ie Holden or kill him, because he has
done me dirt." Both men are talking
loudly and threateningly, and a duel has
heen hinted at. Colonel Loud is a typical
Southerner wlio has the reputation of
having protected his honor on ground
where blood has been spilled. He is a
dead shot. Holdeu stubbornly holds off.
and friends are keeping them apart and
say that a duel may yet end themisunder
standme.
BRYAN IS RENOM MATED.
An Enthusiastic Conference of the Nebraska
Free- Silver League in Session
at Lincoln.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Jan. 6.â The Silver
ites of the State that furnished the silver
Democratic nominee for the Presidency
do nut believe that the question of bimet
allism was s-ettled by the November elec
tion. This much was demonstrated by
the size and make-up of the conference
which was called to order at 2 o'clock to
day in the Lansing Theater by Hon. John
Jeffcoat, for the purpose of organizing a
Nebraska Free-silver Leaeue. Represen
tative Populists, Free-silver Democrats
and Free-silver Repub.icans were conspic
uous in the parquet.
The conference is the outcome of a call
largely and influentially signed, and the
partic.pants represent every county in the
State. Mr. Bryan, who made his appear
ance while the pre inunaries were in
progress, was given an enthusiastic recep
tion. When Bryan arose to address the
assembly the applause was deafening.
Bryan said that the warm reception ac
corded him prompted him to paraphrase
the old saying, "Tis better to have run
am: lost than never to have run at all."
He reviewed the campaign from the Chi
cago convention till the close of the polls.
He showed the great gain of the Silver
pariy since ISSJ4. and said that he believed
that with effurt there could be no ques
tion of victory in 19C0.
There was a ht'.le clash at the opening
of the ssssion over the permanent chair
manship, which was compromised by the
selection of Judge Scott of Omaha, a lree
silver Republican. He made a short ad
dress ami was followed by Congressman
elect W. L. Greene o' Kearney in a more
extended speech, in which he eulogized
W. J. Bryan, :tnd formally, amid wild
cheering, nominated him as "the candidate
of the solid bimetallic forces for President
in 1900. The report of the committee on
credentials waa adopted, seating 632 dele
gates.
I. J, Dunn, a delegate from Douglass
County, made a rabid attack on W. D.
McHu^h, recently appointed Federal
Judge for Nebraska by President Cleve
land. He denounced McHugh as a traitor
to Bryan an l Democracy, and a supporter
of McKinley, and asked the convention to |
put itself on record as opposing his con
tinuation.
Chairman Scott, while tacitly admitting
his sympathy with the speaker, declared
the remarks out of order.
An adjournment until evening was
taken to afiow the committee on resolu
tions to report, but at 9 o'clock the com
initiee was still out, with no prospects of
an early agreement.
OREGON SHORT LINE SALE.
Counsel for tha Reorganization Committee
Ant cipate No Trouble in Securing
the Road.
OMAHA, Nebr , Jan. 6.â Samuel Carr,
chairman, and Henry G. Nichols, counsel
of the reorganization committae of the
Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern
road, went west to-day, en route to Salt
LaKe City. They are empowered to pur
chase the Short Line at its sale in the Utah
city, at 11 o'clock, Saturday morning.
"We anticipate no trouble iv securing
the Short Line at the sale," said Mr. Carr,
I "but of course there is no forecasting as to
! any surprise. But as I said, we know of
I none and anticipate none. It is true that
! we have abont decided on the name of the
] company and the officers of the company
j as well as the officials of the road, but we
do not think it advisable to make them
public at this time. After we have se
j cured the roid there will be time for the
I announcement of the selections and ap
j pointments, and I shall be glad to teil you
j when we return." V
A slate has been talked of for some
time- with these as the officials of the road:
W. H. Bancroft, general manager; S. W.
Eccies, eeneral freight agent ; J- S. Shrop
shire, general attorney; D. E. Buriey or
St. A. D. Hutchinson, general passenger
and ticket agent; F.; W. Hills, auditor,
and L. D. Carrier, general baggage agent.
This slate is speculative, of course, but it
is believed by some who are well informed
on Short Line affairs to be the one.
Tne Union Pacific receivers, Master in
Chancery Cornish and General Manager
Dickinson, will leave in the morning for
Salt Lake City and probably at Laramie,
Wyo., will be joined by General Solicitor
Keley. Their presence in Salt Lake City
at the aale has no special significance, as
the Union Pacific is not a bidder for the
property. The receivers desire to make a
tour of inspection of the system and have
selected this time for going. The busi
ness in which the Union Pacific is par
ticularly interested is after the sale and in
the announcement of officers of the com
pany and officials of the road.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 7, 1897.
CALL SPEAKS ON
HIS RESOLUTION
Addresses the Senate for an
Hour on the Cuban
Situation.
He Urges That "the Cover Be
Taken Off the Scene of
Butchery."
The President Is Instructed to Demand
the Imm diat; Release of
Sanguilly.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 6.â There
were not more than a dozen Senators in
the chamber to-day when the cnaplain
offered his opening prayer and the
galleries were almost deserted.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
in relation to the cost of construction of
armor-plate was presented and referred to
the Committee on Naval Affairs.
An adverse report from the Committee
on Foreign Relations on the claim of John
S. Waller, United Slates Consul at Mada
gascar, for damages by reason of his arrest
and imprisonment, was presented and in
definitely postponed.
A resolution was offered by Hale (R.) of
Maine and agreed to, calling on the Secre
tary of State for a statement concerning
the action of the President or Secretary of
State, touching the recognition of any
foreign people or power as an independent
Government and the corresponding action
of other branches of the United States
Government.
The resolution offered yesterday by Call
(D.) of Florida in relation to the condem
nation of Julio Sanguilly, an American
citizen, by the Spanish authorities in
Cuba to perpetual imprisonment in
chains was taken up, and Call addressed
the Senate. His opening remarks were
directed, however, to the case of Charles
Govin and to the report thereon of Consul-
General Lee, which was presented to the
Senate yesterday, foill discredited the
statements of the Spanish officers as to
Govin having died of wounds received in
battle, and asserted on the authority of a
person, w.'sose name he declined to give
but who was a person of character, that
Govin, a citizen of the United States and
who was in Cuba as a newspaper reporter,
had been arrested, tied to a tree and cut
in pieces with mac: etes by a squad of
cavalry as it rode past.
Reverting to the case of Sanguitly Call
read from a statement to the effect that
Sanguilly, also an American citizen,
had been guilty of no offense whatever
that had been or could be proved against
him. The two cases, Call said, were types
of what was occurring to hundreds of
American citizens in Cuba, and it only
needed investigation by the Senate to
â¢'take the cover off the scene of butchery."
As to a combination of European powers
against the United States Call declared
that there was no danger of such a thing
'n view of the effect which it would have
on the masses of the people in European
countries and that the sympathies of man
kind would be with the American Repub
lic in such a struggle.
At the close ot Call's speech, which oc
cupied over an hour, the resolution call
ing for the correspondence in the case of
Sanguilly was agreed to, also a joint reso
lution instructing the President to de
mand SanguiiJy's immediate release.
The Senate then at 1 p. M. went into
executive session and after a short session
the doors were again opened and legisla
tive business was resumed.
Senate bill to amend the act repealing
the timber culture laws was tafcen ui> and
passed, Pettigrew (K.) of South Dakota,
who reported it from the Committee on
Public Lands, explaining its provisions
and stating that it applied only to the
lands of the great Sioux reservation.
The House bill to provide for the ap
pointment by brevet of active or retired of
ficers of the United States army was taken
from the calendar, amended in some
slight particulars and passed.
Senate joint resolution requesting the
Government of Great Britain to pardon
Mrs. Florence E May brick as an act of
magnanimity â which was reported ad
versely last sessionâ was taken from the
calendar and indefinitely postponed.
At 2 r. m. the unfinished business was
taken up, being the House bill providing
for free homesteads on the public lands in
Oklahoma Territory. The Senate bill, as
it passed the House, referred only to the
public land 3in Oklahoma. As reported
back by the Committee on Indian Affairs
it applies to all country lands acquired
from the various Indian tribes. The com
mittee amendment provides that all sums
of money released, which if not released
would belong to any Indian tribe, shall be
paid to auch Indian tribe by the United
States.
Pettigrew explained the bill at much
length, arguing that it was in the line
with the public policy of developing the
settlement of new Western States.
In the course of the discussion letters
were read from the Interior Department
and from the Government Land Office,
slating that the bill, if restricted to Okla
homa, would result in a loss to the
Government of over $15,000,000, and, if
applied to all lands acquired from Indians,
would result in a loss of over $35,000,0C0.
An argument in support of the bill was
maiie by Carter (R.) of Montana, who
urged that the free homestead policy of
the Government should not be changed
:i- to those Indian lands to the disadvant
age of people seeding homes there. The
lands, ne said, wou.d either bave to be
opened to homestead settlers or be given
over to the dominion of the cattle kings.
The bill went ovc without action, re
maining as the unfinished business, and
at 4 r. m. the Senate adjourned until to
morrow.

Amend* the IoÂ«.m - Jlelating to Second
. Claim Mail Blatter.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 6. -After
two days' debate the House this afternoon
by a vote of 144 to 105 passed the bill in
troduced by Loud, chairman of the Com
mittee on l'ostoflices and Post Road?, to
amend the laws relating to second-ciass
mail matter. The principal features of
the bill were those denying to the mails
as second-class matter sample copies of
newspapers ana serial novel publications
and withdrawing from news agents the
privilege of returning to , their principals
at the pound rate unsold copies of periodi
cals. . â¢
The general debate was closed by Lond
in a half hour's speech in favor of the
bill, preceding which Messrs. Mil liken
(R.) of Missouri, Wanger (R.) of Pennsyl
vania, Tracey (R.) of Missouri, Morse (R.)
of Massachusetts and Bingham (R.) of
Pennsylvania addressed the House in op
position to the bill. Two hours devoted
to a consideration of the bill under the
five-minute rule was productive of no
change in the text as referred to the com
mittee of the whole, and at 4 o'clock it
was reported to the House for final action.
Immediately after the leading of the
journal, Grosvenor (R) of Ohio addressed
ihe Hou=e on a question ot personal privi
lege. He called attention to the fact that
a resolution introduced by him and
adopted by the House, June 5 last, calling
upon the heads of several departments for
certain information as to the operation of
the civil service law had as yet received no
response from any one of the Cabinet
officers. He felt justified, he said, in
raising the question wnether or not Con
gress had been properly treated in this
regard, expresnng the opinion that this
silence of seven months showed that the
heads of the several departments, as well
as the executive himself, had begun to
ignore the demands of Congress.
A resolution asking each Cabinet officer
to inform the House why no response had
beei; made to the original resolution was
agreed to without division.
CHANCES OF THE FUNDING BILL
Congressman Powers Says He Has No
Doubt That It Will Become a
Law This Session.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 6.â The
House Committee on Pacific Railways
held a short meeting to-day to consider
the manner in which the debate on the
bill to settle the indebtedness of the Union
and Central Pacific companies to the Gov
ernment should be conducted when the
bill comes up before the House. It will
be called up to-morrow and a vote will be
taken on Monday next. It will bo vigor
ously opposed by the members from the
Pacific slope and others who favor a gov
ernmental ownership of the roads in pref
erence to an extension of time for paying
the indebtedness. The opposition will in
clude some of the strongest debaters in
the House, and the discussion is expected
to prove of more than ordinary interest
Powers of Vermont, chairman of the
committee, says that several friends of the
bill have made careful canvasses of the
House, and while they do not agree as to
the vote it will receive it is not doubted by
any of them that it will secure a majority
vote. Powers has assurances irom the
Senate that a majority in its favor will
also be found in that body, and he believes
that it will become a law before the 4th of
next March. If the bill does not become
a law it is not doubted that the Govern
ment will foreclose its mortgage, and thus
assume the payment of the 160,000,000
which constitute the first mortgage lien,
and which practically represents the pres
ent value of the roads.

WOOL-GROWERS
HAVE A HEARING
Languishing Industry That
Cries Aloud for
Protection.
Seventy Millions Yearly Spent
Abroad Should Be Kept
at Home.
Sheepmen Who Lose on an Average
$430 Per Annum and Save
$8 on Clothing.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 6.â The
tariff hearings before the Ways and Means
Committee were continued to-day, ''raw
wool" being the schedule under consid
eration.
John G. Clark of Washington County,
Pa., a member of the National Wool
growers' Association, opened the hearing.
The necessity for protection, he said, was
now apparent, the experiment of freo
wool having brought bankruptcy and dis
tress upon many engaged in the wool
growing business. The free wool clau-e
of the Wilson bill he characterized as a
crime.
William Lawrence of Ohio, President of
the National Wool-?rowers' Association,
hoped that the next Congress would give
the wool- growers a protection equal to
that'given to the most favored industries.
This country had the requisite climate,
soil and lands to produce the 630,000,000
pounds of wool of all kinds used yearly
by the American mills. With adequate
production the sheep stock of the United
States could within fouryearsbe increased
so as to yield all the wool consumed here. \
Some $70,000,000 was now being paid
abroad each year for wool. Adequate pro
tection â¢would give American farmers this
sum annually for labor.
He referred to the Wilson-Gorman law
as the most disastrous measure ever
aimed at the wool industry, and suggested
that Australian unwashed wool, which
was equal to any other washed wool, be
classified as washed wool so as to put it on
the same footing with other wools of the
worid. He would place a tariff of 12 cents
on all merino wools except Australian, on
which a rate ol 24 cents was desired be
cause of its "shrinkage qualities.
Asked if a law of the kind he proposed
would not keep Australian wool out of
the country, he replied that if it should it
would prove beneficial. In case it did we
could take wool from South America and
build up a trade with those countries,
which in return would take our products.
Australia, he said, never took anything
from us. He argued in favor of specific
duties, saying that the ad valorem system
was "the most damnable system ever pro
posed by a set of rascals."
Continuing, Mr. Lawrence said Con
gress should, if possible at the present
session, pass a bill with one section de
claring that all articles imported after the
first day of tne first session of the Fifty
fifth Congress shall be subject to the rates
of duty prescribed by any tariff bill
which may become a law during that
session when such rates are higher than
the existing law, and that no article shall
be withdrawn for consumption except
upon the execution of a bond to the
United States with sureties approved by
the proper Collector of the port of entry
for the payment of such increased rates of
duty.
A recess was here taken, and on reas
serrbling Theo. Justice of Philadelphia, a
dealer in all grades of wool, spoke lor the
consumers, wno, he said, had been injured
by free wool. In one year there was a loss
by this schedule alone to the American
people of $426,000,000. The loss to mill
hands and laborers by free wool had been
about $85,000,000 during the last year.
The wool-growers of New York, lie said,
had lost on an average of $430 per annum,
while saving on cioihine about $3.
Speaking of wool as a munition of war,
Mr. Justice called the attention of the
committee to the condition in which the
country would find itselt in case of war
with Great Britain if the American wool
clip decreased as it had been doing, and
he pointed to the condition of the conti
nental troops under General Washington
at Valley Forge and to the condition of
the Confederates during the late war.
In discussing the various tariffs Re said
that under the law of 1863 the woo. indus
try had prospered and increased, and if it
had remained in force until 1895 he as
serted that American sheep, at the rate of
increase whvie the law existed, would have
produced 650.000,000 pounds of wool an
nually, dr sufficient to supply all our de
mands. The law of 1883 he characterized
as the worst ever enacted, as far as the
wool act was concerned. Under it the
number of sheep had decreased 17 per
cent in five years. From 1888 until Presi
dent Cleveland's election the industry,
under a 10-cenW rate, had prospeied. A
10-cent rate he considered adequate. The
industry again suffered from 1893 to 1896,
the number of sheep decreasing 23 per
cent in those four years, while the indus
try abroad had increased.
In his opinion the term "carpet wools"
should be abandoned and wool costing 10
cents per pound ana under should be
classed as "third class." Quantities of
such wools were now being used in blank
ets and clothing. Whatever duty was
placed on this class of wool would be
purely for revenue and would not afreet
the industry in this country. The wool
section of the McKinley law was drawn by
a convention of expert representative
wool-growers and manufacturers.
in replying to a question by Chairman
Uingley he said that the demand for cheap
clothing increased under the Wilson bill.
These clothes could not be made of wool,
so the demand for shoddy had increased.
The demand for cheap material was
on account of the reduction in wage?.
Under the McKinley law a good wool suit
sold for about $10. Workmen made suf
ficient to buy them. Under the Wilson
law wages diminished and the demand
was for suits worth about $5. This ac
counted for the advent of shoddy.
G. C. Moses of Bath, Me., an importer
and manufacturer, said that if the course
advocated by Mr. Lawrence was adopted
it meant death to the manufacturer and
would restrict importations.
Delegate Catron of New Mexico said
that under the McKiuley law his Territory
had produced some 16,000,000 pounds of
wool per year. Under the present law the
production had decreased, as had the
price. The decrease in the latter item
was about 11 cents per pound.
J. W. Smith of Layton, Utah, president
of the Wool-Growers' Association, stated
that what Dele -ate Catron had said of the
condition in New Mexico applied to his
State. What the wool-growers oi" UUh
wanted was a fixed tariff, also a specific
duty on wool.
W. H. Brown, a manufacturer of Phila
delphia, asked for a duty of 10 cents on
oils and waste.
John Ri.igeway of Philadelphia spoke
for the wool-sorters. He hoped that
when the question of "skirting wool"
came up the workmen would be remem
bered. He wanfe-4 an additional duty on

here a chance to sort wools and not have
this done abroad.
C M Hoeg of Ohio, a manufacturer and
wool-dealer, advocated a conservative bill.

morrow, when the manufacturers of wool
will be hean^ ,

OREGON CITY, Or., Jan. 6.â John W.
C. Green, who has been hiding in this city
for the past two days, having deserted the
British ship Lord Elgin, which left Port
land for Capo Town last week, tells a
seemingly probable story about the es
cape from this country of James Dunham,
who murdered the McGlincys near San
Jose, Cal.. on the 27th of last May.
Green says that in April and May he
worked on the ranch of Bernard Murphy
near San Jose, and during a part of that
time Dunham was a fellow-laborer with
him on the ranch. At the end of May
Greeu went to San Francisco and stopped j
at Peter McManus' boarding-house, but
shipped on June 5 as second officer of the
American ship St. John, with a full cargo
of wheat and flour for New York. WheTT
seven days out, while the vessel was off
tne Mexican coast, a stowaway showed up
oti deck and Green recognized him as
Dunham.
Dunham appealed to Grsen not to
reveal his identity, to call him Brown and
treat him well and gave the officer $60 in
gold. At the mate's request the stowaway
was assigned to liia watch and put to work
as a seaman. The St. John haa a rather
Blow passage and did not arrive at New
York until November 17. Green and Dun
ham went ashore together and near the
wharf met an officer of the filibustering
Bliip Bermuda. Thi3 greatly pleased Dun
ham and he at once made arrangements j
to go to Cuba. The vessel left port the
next day and Dunham went with it.
â  Green claims that was the last he saw of
the murderer, whom he did not then know
to be a murderer. In explanation of his j
ignorance of the McClincy massacre Green
says he seldom looks at a newspaper,
being addicted to novel-reading to such a
decree that ail his spare time is thus em
ployed. Dunham at first supposed that
Green Knew why he was traveling as a
stowaway and talked to him about the
murder, but when he found that the mate
had heard nothing about the affair he
turned it eff as a joke and said he was
makine the trip for the sake of adventure.
â¢ In New York, Green says, he happened
to run across an old advertisement for
Dunham, and then he looked up a news
paper file in a water-front saloon and
learned all about the matter. He went
The Filibustering Steamship Bermuda, on Which Murderer
Dunham Is Said to Have Escaped to Cuba*
overland to San Francisco, and thence ]
immediately to Portland.
Duntvam professed to be wholly un
skilled in the work of a sailor, but Green '
says that could hardly nave been true, for
the third time he was sent up he could
furl a royal or a topgallant sail as well as
anybody. He was regarded as the most
reliable lookout on the ship. He was act
ive and quick to learn, and made an excel
lent sailor.
Green represents himself as a graduate
of the University of Virginia, class of '86,
and his writing and language do not con
tradict the claim. He says he has fol
lowed the sea off and on for more tlian
four year?, mostly on the Pacific, and his
weather-worn appearance bears out the
assertion. .He is now 28 years old. His
parents, he say?, live in San Francisco, his
father being in the drug business. He
swears his story is true, and there is no
way either to prove or disprove it here.
Green left for Sa:i Francisco to-night.

Horrible Practices of Spaniard* With
the .Corpses' of Thfir Victim*. ]'â Â
â  NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 6.â The Sun's
Havana special says: The Spanish news
papers here violently attack the American
representative, Mr. Money, for violating
the laws of war proclaimed by the Spanish
authorities and which forbid all investiga
tions in the military camps not expressly
sanctioned by the commander-in-chief of
the army. â¢ fx
Horribie details are known in Havana
of the assassinations last week at Guana
bacoa by orderof the Spanish Major, Fon
deviella. The bodies of the young base- 1
ball players, Pistorzia, Parra and Casiillo,
murdered 'by the troops without cause,
were left to tbe dogs to be eaten. The
families of the three unfortunate young
men applied to Fondeviella, asking per
mission to bury the bodies. # ;;
"Bodies of Cubans, 1 ' answered Fonrte
viella, "are lit only to feed to dogs." :

that their sacred request would ;be

JAMES C DUNHAM, THE FUGITIVE MURDERER.
John. W Green, a deserter from the British ship Lord Elgin, who is now at
Oregon City, Or., declares that tha slayer of tne McGlincy3 escaped to Cuba. He
says that Dunham sailed around the Horn on the American ship St. John, in
which he left San Francisco as a stowaway. At New York, Green asserts, Dun
ham embarked on the filibuster Bermuda for Cuba.
Guanaboco for Havana, terrorized by the
massacres and the present insecurity of
life.
Weyler does not pay the lea^t attention
to the charges made against Fondevielia,
and says the latter is merely doing his
duty.
In Havana the same terror prevails and
the only Cuban families remaining in the
capital are those who have relatives or ac
quaintances among the Spanish authori
ties, or those who are absolutely without
means to leave the country. Among the
latter the men do not know what their
iate may be from day to day. Arrests are
made daily, the charges being only that
the accused sympathize with the insur
gents.
It is not true that General Gomez has
issued a proclamation ordering his troops
to retaliate against the Spanish barbari
ties. It is said here, however, that Gomez
has written to Weyler, telling him that ii
the Spanish policy of assassinating
Cubans continues and also the massacre
of pacincos and wounded, he will be
obliged to retaliate.
"Yours and only yours," says Gomez,
''will be the responsibility for such bar
barous warfare before history and hu
manity."
In his march to the west Gomez has
lar^e forces of cavalry ana his infantry is
well provisioned witli munitions.
&EXATORS J-lV FULL RETREAT.
Will Not Attempt to force the Cameron
Jietolutions.
WASHINGTON, IK C. Jan. 6âAl
though the Cuoan resolutions were not
discussed in the session of the Committee
on Foreign Relations this morning, owing
to the absence of Mr. Camerou, the mem-
hers of the committee talked about the
resolutions informally after the other
business had been finished. It seems cer
tain trora the temper of t ; c committee
that if the effort is made to have the Cam
eron resolutions referred back to the com
mittee there will be a bitter light, and the
committee will indorse its action in or
dering the report and resolution which
are now on the calendar.
Such effort is not anticipated, fer Mr.
Hale and those who are with him are
satisfied with the present condition of
things and will do nothing to start the
agitation.
Members of tbe committee appreciate
the strength of the organisation that has
been effected to prevent final action by
the Senate, and there appears to be a
tacit understanding that the resolution
shall not now ba pushed. A sufficient
number of Senators have been arrayed on
the other side to protract debate, and the
friends of tha resolutions nnd that by
rushing them they will pass no appro
priation bills. The present indication ap
pears to be against action on tbe Cameron
resolutions.
TAKES FOR IHE TB.UEB FRIXSItS
Atlantic Coast Tug Pursued by the
American 1 miser Raleigh.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 6.-The big
ocean-going tug Walter A. LucKenbach,
which arrived yesterday from Mobile,
had a brush with the United States
cruiser Raleieh on her southward trm.
Mato Cates told tbe story yesterday.
The Luckenbach went south to tow up
the British ship Everest, wuicu having
sprung aleak bad been beached in the
Mississippi, and after repairs had been
purchased by the Luckenbachs. She
stopped at Norfolk for coal December 9,
when on the way down the coast and then
proceeded
She had reached Alligator Reef, off the
Florida coast, December 4, when Captain
Wiiiem espied the Raleigh, which is
patrolling the coast on the lookout for
Cuban filibusters. The Raleigh circled
around the Luckenbach, first crossing her
bow some distance ahead, and then grad
ually swinging around to follow her
cloielj.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 7, 1897.
Captain "Willem is proud of his boat,
which is one of the fastest of the kind on
the coast, and as his papers were all right
he determined to give the cruiser a chase.
She had made no signal ordering the tug
to heave to, so all steam was crowded on
and she plowed her way along at a four
teen-knot gait.
A cloud of black smoke trailing after
the Raleigh indicated that she was giving
chase. She was well astern, however,
having lost in coming around. Four
hours passed in this pastime, and then
a puff of blue smoke and a report that
came echoing over the water from the
Raleigh told Captain Willem that he
was eSpected to lie to. He did so with
promptitude, a boat was lowered from the
cruiser and an officer came aboard. He
examined the papers, asked questions and
then told Captain Wiliem that he might
go on. His boat had been mistaken for
the Three Friends.
USDER BRSTESC.E OF DEATH.
Amerietn Xewtnaper Correspondent
Jtoowd to I>ie in Cuba.
WASHINGTON', D. C, Jan. 6.â An affi
davit was left with Secretary Olney yester
day morning, signed by Marina Elena Del
;:ado Green, sister of Htnry Delgado, said
to be dying in a Cuban prison. The charge
has been tnade that Harry Delgado is a
Cuban and identical with Ricardo Del
gado, an innurgent officer.
ThÂ« affidavit declares that Harry Del
gado was born in Brooklyn in 1865, lived
there seven s*ears and was educated in
New York. He was twice purser of the
Ward line of steamers and in about 1890
he was married in Hudson, N. V., to Miss
Sophie Granger.
He was then engaged in the brewery
business, but in the last year joined the
staff of a New York paper, and a few
months ago went to Cuba as correspond
ent.
Tne affidavit states that Ricardo De!
gado is an entirely different person, a
Cuban by birth, although a cousin o:
Harry Delgado, and an artillery officer in
the Cuban army.

SANTA BARBARA, Cal.. Jan. 6.âAu
thentic news has ju9t been brousht to
town of a lien gold' Strike on the adjoining
ranches of Charles Cathcart and George
Williams in Smiths Canyon, six miles

SACRAMENTO INDICTMENTS.
Ex- Deputy Clerk Landsborough Held for
Trial for Forgery and Presenting
Fraudulent Jury Demands.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 6.âAs
sembly L.M. Landsborough of the
Sacramento delegation is again in trouble,
as the Grand Jury to-day found five more
indictments against him, and it is rumored
that the end is. not yet. Of the indict
ments brought to-day two were for
forgery and three for presenting fraudu
lent jury demands, and it is claimed that
the lull amount of his peculations is not
known even yet. It is said that investi
gation has developed the fact that even
the July jury demands have been tam
pered with.
Assemblyman Landsborough has been 'â 
in the County- Clerk's office for nearly
four years, and until the records .of the
office for that period have been examined
it will not be known how much Sacra
mento County has suffered financially at
the bands of this servant ot the people.
Landsboroueh is occupying his seat in the
Assembly and assisting in perfecting laws
i to govern the people.
In the indictments brought to-day bail
was fixed at $1500 in ea"ch case. This is a
very material reduction from the amounts
fixed in the first indictments, which were
$5000 each, but was afterward reduced to
$2500. - '.._ ' '.:.
DUBOIS LEADS IN IDAHO.
His Return to the "Senate Made Practi
cally Certain by the Quarrel of
Fusionists.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Jan. 6.â The Popu
list contingent of the Idaho Legislature
threatens to frustrate the plans of the Dem
ocrats to elect their United States Senator
by either scattering its votes among can
didates who have no chance, and thus
preventing uny election, or by voting for
Dubois, the silver Republican.
The Dubois supporters appear to bold
the balance of power, and unless the
quarrel between the Democrats and Popu
lists is made up the election of Dv Bois is
considered exceedingly probable.
li the fusionists do come together again,
which is problematical, the plum will go
to either Johnson, Democrat, or Claggett,
Populist, but at this time Dubois is
thouht to have the best chance of any of
the candidates.

SUIBUN, Cal., Jan. 6.â Last July a
proposition was submitted to thja voters of
Suisun to incur a municipal indebtedness
of $42,000 lor a new water system, and it
was carried by an overwhelming ma
jority. The Board of Town Trustees has
since worked hard to dispose of the bonds,
but its efforts were not rewarded by suc

of which was the sale of the 6 per cent

Santa Barbara. Man's Mania.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Jan. 6.â A
pitiable case of dethroned reason was pre
sented here to-day, when 0. Ellison, a
survivor of tne British ship Golden Horn,
that was wrecked off Santa Rosa Island
five years ago, was by the court ordered
to be sent to the Highland Asylum for
the insane. Ellison was ship's carpenter
on the il. -fated vessel, and like others of
the crew, remained in Santa Barbara
after tlie wreck and rescue. He worked
at his trade occasionally and built a few
private yachts for residents of this city
and Montecito. Tne shock of the wreck
preyed upon his mind so that at times he
would be despondent and again act as if
trying to rescue some drowning comrade.
Finally his brother and friends, fearing
that he might become a raving maniac,
bro u g lit about his commitment to the
asylum.
Drowned *ear GarbervMl*.
EUREKA. Cal., Jan. 6.â Word reached
here from GarberviUe this morning that
the south fork of the Eel River in this
county has claimed another victim. This
tirna it was John Somerville, ttie 15-year
old son of George Soraerville of Briceland.
The drowning occurred on New Year's
day, when the boy with two companions
went out on the river in a rowboat. The
boys lost control of the boat and it was
upset. Two of them managed to cling to
the boat, which was eventually carried in
to the shore, but young Somerville was
swept down the stream. He was seen to
swim with tne current about 200 yards,
when, throwing up his hands, he cried,
"Wait for me !" and then sank. The boJy
has not been recovered.
AnqrX* Camp Stage Wrecked.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. s.â The stage
from Angels Camp to Milton met with an
accident this morning, the passengers
being thrown out and some of them badiy
bruised. When about ten miles this side
of Angels, horses and driver are usually
changed. This was done this morning,
and after the second driver had taken his
seat on the box the horses started down
the grade on a run. In some way they
got beyond the driver's control, and uear
the foot of the grade the coach was over
turned. The vehicle was wrecked. For
tunately none sustained serious injuries,
one lady passenger being the most se
verely brui-ed. Another conveyance was

TRIES IN VAIN
TO SAVE A LIFE
Redwood City Young Lady-
Fails to Prevent a
Suicide.
Strikes at a Glass Containing
Foison in the Hands of a
Drunken Man.
Half of the Liquid Is Spilled, but the
Rest Is Drained to the
Dregs.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Jan. 6.â Frank
William Goepfert committed suicide here
this morning by taking a dose of strych
nine. Goepfert bad teen drinking to ex
cess since New Year's day. He was told
early this morning by Hind & Langley,
for whom he was working, that unless ne
sobered up he would be discharged. About
10:30 o'clock be applied to a young laciy
bookkeeper in the place for a glass. After
procuring it be went back to where he bad
been at work, but in two or three minutes
returned with the glass filled with a
liquid. He informed the bookkeeper that
it contained strichnine and that he in
tended taking it.
After remonstrating with him to no
avail tn"e young lady struck the glass and
spilled about half of the contents. Goepfert
immediately drained the balance in her
presence and then departed. The vounc
lady believed that he was probably joking,
and that the glass contained nothing hut
water, but when he returned in a few min
utes and repeated that what he had taken
was strychnine she sent for a physician.
Two dociors soon arrived ani worked
over Goepfert for fifteen minutes, at the
end of which time he was dead. He was
a young man, 25 years of age, and has
borne a good reputation, his only failing
being that he was addicted to drink.
SAN MATEO SENSATION.
County Board of Education Accused of
Favoritism in Granting Teachers'
Diplomas.
REDWOOD CITY. Cal., Jan. 6 âBoard
of Education, examinations, Grand Jury,
Supervisors, expertâ these half-dozen
words whispered to any citizen of San
Mateo County would immediately suggost
a story which has aroused considerable
feeling throughout the county, wherein
the Board of Education and the teachers
of certain of the public schools figure
most conspicuously. A few months ago
the Board of Education held examinations
for the granting of diplomas. After the
result liad become known, those who were
successful were, of course, jubilant, and
those failing were naturally disappointed.
Had this been all, there would probably
have been an end to it then and there;
but the successes and failures were of such
NEW TO-DAY.

One of the leading citizens of this place
toik the matter in hand and carried it for
investigation before the Board of Super
visors, iie addressed a comnSunication
to tnera and appeared personally to press
the case. He particularly called attention
to the fuct thar all of the applicants Irom
Menlo Park, San Mateo, YVoodside and
eiÃht out of nine frotn Halfmoon Bay
passed the examination, whiie only five
out of twelve from Pescadero and five out
of nineteen from Redwood City were suc
cessful. He thought it rather strance
that in schools only a few miles apart,
wnere the studies were the same, tnere
should be such a wide difference in the re
sults of the â¢ xaminauon. He asued the
Br>ard of Supervisors to appoint some
suitable and disinterested person to ex
amine the papers, at ttie same tims offer
ins to defray all expenses out of his own
pocket.
The board considered that it had no au
thority in the matter, and the affair was
temporarily dropped. As soon as the
Grand Jury was formed the case was
broueht to its attention, and the jurors
deemed it of sufficient importance
to receive their consideration. They so
informed the Board of Supervisors
through their foreman, and askea that an
appropriation irom the county funds of
$200 be voted for the Hiring o; an expert
to review the examination papers, and re
port, together with any opinion or recom
mendation wh-ch he nii^ht consider
proper. On this suggestion the board al
lowed the $200, and sek-cted an expert
from Berkeley, who srill at once com
mence work. The result of his investiga
tion is awaited with interest, as the affair
has attracted more than ordinary atten
tion throughout the county. The Grand
Jury will make its report on the 20th of
this month.
FRESNO'S TREASURE CACHE.
Finders of Bandit Murietta's Hoard Will
Return to Prospect for
More.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 6. â Ex- Deputy
Constable J. G. Wofford still refuses to
divulge any further particulars regarding
the find of the Joaquin Murietta treasure,
unearthed by himself and a Iriend near
the Firebaugh graveyard, in the western
portion of the county, recently. He can
not be prevailed upon to tell who hi?
friend is, where he is or what ha 3 become
of the fortune, which amounts to some
thing like $147,000. It may be tnat the
amount is exaggerated somewhat, buc
there is hardly any doubt that treasure
was discovered.
Wofford says that he intends in a few
days to return to the spot where the
treasure was unearthed and do some
"placer mining." He believes that in the
haste of himself and his companion to get
the trunk out of the ground tney lost
several gold pieces. The trunk had de
cayed and they had to take it from the
earth in pieces. The bags in which the
gold was found had also rotted, so that
they~ould hardly hold together, and the
treasure had to be lifted out by hand by
the finders:
The sight of the large amount of yellow
metal of course excited Wofford and bis
friend and they did not use the greatest
care in handling the co:n. The ex
constable thinks that $500 or 5630 mig lit
have been lost in the dirt, and it is for this
that he is going to use the pan.

THE; CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL,
Send a statesman to the Senate.
California's voice at 'Washington should
be eloquent.
All we ask in the Senatorial tight is that
the best man should win.
A United States Senator should under
stand the constitution and be able to ex
pound it.
It is time to take the dummy off the
Senatorial track and make way for some
thing better.
Quay has won his victory in the Sena
torial right and Wanamaker wili continue
to attend to bis own business.
The only way to convince the Nation of
the vigor of California is to have that
vigor illustrated in the Senate.
The Republicans of California must
have in the highest legislative body in tne
Nation a representative who can speak for
their interests with force and effect.
The steps already taken by the Legisla
ture in the direction of economy are full
of good assurances to the people. This is
going to be a Legislature to be proud of.
The report of a battle ending in a vic
tory for the Cubans on New Year's day
throws some light on the unexplained
sudden return of Weyler to Havana a few
days ago.
The Examiner's insinuations that the
Republican members of the Legislature
are open to bribery are, of course, intended |
to help Perkins, but it is hard to see how i
they will do it.
When the leaders of a caucus break their
pledges to those whom they induced by
such pledges to enter it, the decision it i
reaches is no more binding than any other
contract obtained by fraud.
Sir Charles Tupner did wrong in telling
the English that the United States desires
to absorb Canada. We have no such de
sire, but such talk may create it and then
England's troubles would begin.
Agriculturists from all parts of the
Union are in Washington asking for pro
tection to home industry. The farmers
have learned at last :hat protection does j
protect and that free trade is disaster.
The Senate did not open up as lively as
was expected on reassembling after the
hoiiday recess. Senator Petter read a long
speech and the reporters announced that
'the day was marked by a "sl-.epy
session."
The anti-funding resolutions adopted
by the Legislature said exactly the right
things in the ri^ht way and will be ac
cepted at Washington as a true expres
sion of the sentiments of the people of
California.
Those New York Democrats who have
issnel a manifesto denouncing Senator
Hill as a hypocrite have done him an in
justice. There was no hypocrisy in re
fusing to follow the Bryan crowd and still
less in scorning to take part in the Paimer
fake.
Secretary Herbert's report on the result
of his investigations of the cost of making
armor plate comes too late to be of any
benefit 10 this administration, but all ttie
same he deserves credit for his work and
there can be little doubt the country will
profit by it.
By way of a change from sermons a
Kansas clergyman is said to have started
in to read to his congregation every Sun
day evening a serial story entitled '"Jake
the Merchant," written by himself; and
thus does the new era bring the pulpit
into rivalry with the press.
Bayard is not to go altogether without a
gift for the holidays. The American
colony in London has raised money to get
him a loving cup, and as it is said his- bust
is to be displayed on it there is every
reason to expect the presentation will be
accompanied by hilarity.
In the New York Journal Willie Hearsi
lampoons Senator Perkins as the Jaughin/
stock of the Senate, and in the Examiner
he cieclares Mr. Perkins is better fitted to
represent California than any other man
in the State. It is evident that Willie
doesn't think much of Californians.
The insinuations made in the Examiner
against the honor and integrity of R pub
lican members of the Legislature are in
accordance with its usual practice. Any
thing calculated to defile, defame or in
jure California in the estimation of East
ern people is exactly the kind of sensation
it delights in.
There should be united and harmonious
work among Republicans of California to
secure a representative of the State ;n the
next Cabinet and now is the time for the
work to be done. The Cabinet will soon
be made up and any dissensions at this
juncture might ruin tha present, bright
chances of success.
The very fact tbat Senator Perkins en
gaged the Examiner to make his right for
tbe senatoiahip was fair notice to the
public that it would be a campaign
of slander against honest Republi
cans. The Exu miner has already charged
that Republican legislators are corrupt
and are waiting for bribes. There can be
no baser he than that, but there can be
dirtier ones, and. as the Examiner is capa

GIVE US A STATESMAN.
There was a time when the United States Senate was the luminous center of
American politics. There was a time when there emanated from that body great
orations which served for the education of the people in all matters of politics and
legislation. There was a time when the country was proud of the Senate. There
was a time when every citizen was led to take an interest in great principles of
government by the very eloquence with which they were presented by the states
men of tie country. There was a time when the whole Pacific Coast was given
prestige in the Union by the matchless eloquence of Baker. By common consent
those times were regarded as the glorious days of the Republic, and the American
Senate was conceded even by European writers to be the most august legislative
council in the world.
If a different condition of affairs prevails to-day it is the fault of those to
whom has been entrusted the duty of electing Senators. Great principles still
I remain In our politics, and American genius is as eloquent as ever. If, there
' fore, onr politics is not expressed with the eloquence of other days, it is simply because
j an evil condition of affairs has as far as possible divorced talent from statesman
ship by depriving it of office. We can revive the glory of the former age and re
store to the Senate its prestige by the election of right men, and if we fail to do
so the fault is our own.
California now has an opportunity to do her share toward restoring the conditions
which made the Kepublic illustrious. Her Legislature is engaged in the task of
determining who shall represent the State in the United States Senate for the next
six years. The choice has been virtually narrowed down to two men. One repre
sents that uninspiring type of man, in whose words there is no influence and
in whose actions there is no leadership. The other represents the type of character
which at all times and among all peoples has been regarded with admiration and
esteem. Which of these men will the Legislature elect? It is to be regretted
that such a question should have to be asked. It is a shame that the answer should
be doubtful.
Samuel M. Shortridge out of office and devoid of large wealth, having no adventi
tious aids from time or circumstance, has though in his youth rilled a larger place
in the political history of California and in the esteem of it* people than his competi
tor, clothed though he be with the robes of office, backed by large wealth and having
every assistance which age, official station and money can give him.
Give us a statesman. California needs at this time in tne United States Senate a
man who fully represents all the characteristics of the new era in her social, poli
tical and industrial life. She needs a man who feels her aspirations, who sympa
thizes with all her aims and ambitions, who understands her relation to the
United States, who comprehends her desire to play a great part in making the
destinies of the Nation, and who has in Mm the power to give expression to these
aims, ambitions and aspirations in a voice of Rennine eloquence.
Give us a statesman. California should do her share toward restoring the great
days of the Republic and making the United States Senate once more the admi
ration of the world. We should send to that, the highest of ihe great councils of
the Nation, a man who can worthily take his part in the discussion not merely of
the petty interests of trade but of the great and far-reaching issues of politics
which affect the larger destinies of our Republic. We should have in the Senate
a man who can do something more than mumble and stammer his opinion or lack
of opinion on minor issues. We should have an orator with a large intellectual
horizon. We should have a Senator who in the fullest sense of the word will illus
trate California.
A Greek poet ages ago to!d the Athenians a fable which well illustrates the dif
ference between the types of men who are represented in this contest between Sam
uel M. Shortridge and Mr. Perkins. Both thp serpent and the eagle, he said, can
reach the highest peaks of the mountains. The serpent, however, must crawl. He
must wind a slow and tortuou9 way to the summit. The eagle, on the other hand,
has but to spread his wings, soar through the air and lit; lit upon the peak.
If Senator Perkins wins his way to the office it will be but by the toilsome
and tortuous processes of political intrisue. The people will not be proud
of such a man in office, and he himself will have little reason for
exultation in bis attainment of it, since to him it can be nothing more
than an opportunity of serving interests which might be as well pro
vided for in his private counting-room. The election of Samuel M. Shortridge to
the Senate would be like the eagle's flight to that high eminence. He would be
borne there by his own merits, supported by the favorable winds of public esteem,
and from his high position would watch with eagle eye and guard with, an eagle
courage the welfare of the State and the glory of the Republic
A CAMPAIGN OF INSULT.
The campaign of insult which the organs of Senator Perkins are conducting in
their effort to compel his re-election is arousing indignation in the heart of every
believer in political decency, and especially in the breasts of the members of
the Legislature. The San Francisco Examiner and â¢ the Los Angeles
Times seem to have agreed that the proper way to increase the
chances of Mr. Perkins is to persistently charge that every member of
either house who dares to vote against him has been bought, and that if his opponent
is to be successful it will only be by a wholesale indulgence in bribery to which it is
broadly intimated a sufficient number of the Senators and Assemblymen are suscep
tible.
This double insult to the members of the Legislature and to the candidate for Sena
tor whose merit may find favor in their eyes deserves a signal rebuke. The Los
Angeles Times is indulging in a style of journalism in this respect
which is a disgrace to Southern California and which the members
of the Legislature from that important section of the State must, in
justice to their own honor, disapprove. In its issue of last Sunday the Times pub
lished what purported to be a dispatch received "By the Times' special wire" (which
it has not) from fcan Francisco, asserting that the friends of Samuel M. Sbortrldge had
entered into a Vila conspiracy to bribe a sufficient number of the
Legislature to insure his choice as Senator, and that already by this de
bauching process a majority of them had been secured. The Times
proceeded to comment editorially upon its evidently faked dispatch with added sug
gestions of the purchasable quality of the Legislature. Its editor knew perfectly that
the whole matter was a lie, and that his editorial approval of it, was not only an out
rage upon hone-ty but was also a foul aud inexcusable insult to every member of the
State Legislature.
The San Francisco Examiner is the original offender in this method of advancing
Mr. Perkins' cause. From the day that the members of the Legislature began to
gather at Sacramento it has not ceased to indulge in every offensive form of
suggestion that there was a "sack" at the State capital to be used in the
election of a Senator and that the Republicans of both houses were
susceptible to its influence. The obvious purpose of this infamous and unfounded
charge was to frighten as many legislators as possible into the belief that an honest
expression of their preferenca for any other candidate than Senator Perkins would
lay their reputations liable to the smut of a charge of brib -ry.
Tne outra-e, insult and infamy of tb.l3 method of conducting a Senatorial cam.
paign may not be apparent to the Examiner, for the reason that it is merely indulging
in its usual and favorits habit of libel and lies. It may be possible, also, that it
is not yet fully impressed upon the minds of Mr. Perkins' managers, but unless
we mistake the jealous regard which the members of the Legislature have fortiieir own
honor they will recent the insult in a way which will be sufficiently impressive both
.0 Mr. Perkins and the twu newspapers who are employing this perilous method of
makius his fight.
The fact that the aspiration of a
candidate for the United States
Senate is fou ded solely upon his
merit is one which should of itself
attract the friendship and favor of
every man who is inspired with a
"worthy ambition for a wider
sphere of noble and us.ful ac
tion. The members of the State
Legislature cannot well afford to
deal hastily or slightingly with
such a candidate, nor fail
to realize the honor which would
redound to themselves and to Cal
ifornia in the choice of such a
Senator. Let it therefore not be
forgotten that the friends of
Samuel M. Shortridge base their
claim to the favorable considera
tion of his name for Senator upon
no other argument than that of
his most eminent fitness for the
office.
CALIFORNIA'S VOICE.
The resolutions adopted by the Legisla
ture condemning the Powers- Gear bill now
before Congress and favoring the immedi
ate collection of tne Pacific roads debts on
maturity, is in the fullest sense the voice of
California. It is an official expression
of the sentiments of the ereat majority
of the people of the State and as such it
is entitled to respectful consideration
from every memb3r of Congress.
The resolutions go further than a mere
condemnation of the funding bill. They
ask on behalf of the State of California
lor a hearing before the respective com
mittees of Congress having jurisdiction of
the subject. They request that the bill now
before the iiouse be recommitted and ac
tion delayed until such a hearing can be
provided.
It is not at all probable tbat the request
lot a hearing will be granted by the
House, inasmuch as that body has already
fixed upon the time for the consideration
of tno bill and arranged the programme
for debate and for taking a vote. Never
theless tbe petition will have its weight in
determining the action of a considerable
number ol Congressmen when the vote is
taken. There is, moreover, a chance that
the petition will receive favorable consid
eration in tbe Senate. At any rate, it ul
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 7, 1897.
fords to the opponents of the measure a
reasonable ground for advocating delay in
t c consideration of the measure untii
j California can be heard by her representa
j tives and make clear the interests which
she has at stake.
Taken as a whole the resolutions are
wise, conservative and statesmanlike.
Tiiere is not a word in them which any
one would care to have eliminated. They
ask as much as the State has a right to
expect and no more. Tlu-y request noth

of the whole Nation as to California.
They can be cordially supp< rted by all

-1 cates of relieving the Pacific roads lrom
their liabilities to the Government and
acknowledging that the Republic of the
i United States is not strong enough to en

i ticn.
The Legislature is to be commended for
its promptness in passing the resolutions.
j The vigor which it has displayed by so
! doing will have as much weight as the

funding bill is passed no blame can be
laid on thosi who have been elected to

after Us welfare. They have acted with
wisdom and with promptness, and this is
the full measure of the duty imposed upon
j them.
FARM INDUSTRIES.
The hearing before the Ways and Means
Committee on Tuesday was one of the
most interesting of the session. The sub
ject under consideration was protection
for the agricultural industries of the coun
try, and tuc attendance before the com
mittee gave ample proof that the farmers
have learned irom the depression of the
last four year 3 the importance of protec
tion to their general welfare.
One of the gratifying features of the
hearing was the fact that ail sections of
the country were represented. Testimony
was given to the committee by men from
P*ninylvimia, Kansas, California, Vir
ginia, New York, Connecticut, South Caro
lina, Michigan. Massachusetts and Ari
zona. The industries represented were
stock-raising, fruit-growing, cotton, mar
ket gardening, hay-growing, rice culture,
raisin production, horticulture, wool,
gra n and the hop industry.
From the evidence submitted to the
committee, it appears that every one of
these agricultural industries has been in
juriously affected by the Democratic tariff
All sections of the country have suffered,
and as a consequence men in all depart
ments of industry and in all States of the
Union are now united in sustaining the
Republican policy of protection. This
gives assurance to the belief that the tariff
issue will be eradicated from politics, and
that with the enactment of a thoroughly
comprehensive protection measure by the
next Congress, this long debated question
will cease to disturb our industries or in
terfere with the enterprises of our people
The free-traders inThe committee were
not let a leg to stand on. They attempted
to obtain from' the farmers who asked for
protection an admission that the protec
tive tariff wou.d increase the price to the
consumer, but even in this they failed.
As an illustration of how the point wife
met, it is sufficient to cite the answer
made by Congressman Bowers to the
statement that an increase in the duty on
fruit would raise the price. In reply to
the suggestion Mr. Bowers said that the
fruit-growers of California would guaran
tee to increase production and decrease
price?, and to confirm the guarantee he
pointed out the well-known fact that such
had been the case in the past.
The only objection made to increased
duties came from a representative of the
produce merchants of New York City, who
asked for a low duty on early vegetables.
His argument was that these goods being
imported from tropical countries would
not corae into competition with the prod
ucts of American soil, which ripened later
than those of the tropic islands. Whether
this plea is good or not, it is significant
that it was the only objection made to
protection to American agriculture. It
came not from a farmer but from a mer
chant, and thereby emphasized the fact
that the farmers as a body have become
thorough protectionists.

San Francisco Chronicle.
The "old journalism" :s not approved by the
"new journalism." And for cause.
The old journalism, of which the New York
Herald is the foremost American type, was
sending a relief expedition into Africa, which
opened up a continent, while the new journal
ism was confined to the office of the Police
Gazette.
When ihe way seemed open to reach the
north pole through Bering Sea, the old jour
nalism sent the Jeannclte to find it, whi!e the
new journalism was content to make salacious
pictures of the New York dives.
The world was appalled by the misrule In
Ireland, and the old journalism, still repre
sented at its best by the New Ycrk Herald,
opened a subscription for the Land League,
which it headed with $100,000. Meanwhile
the latest essay in new journalism, the New
York Truth, had forged the Morey letter.
A bloody civil war broke out in Chile. The
old journalism sent its correspondents to de
scribe it and printed daily reports which the
London Times felt obliged to copy and which
the new journalism made no effort to rival.
The latter was too busy describing the wed
ding hosiery of New York belles.
The ola journalism spends its money with
out stint in the collection and publication of
the news. The new journalism never avoids
a lie if the lie is well told nor loses a chance to
print a fake if tho fake is sensational. It
makes murderers of innocent men, acquires
vast circulations with a nod to ttfe nffidavit
maker, takes criminal cases out of the hands
of the jury and tries them in its own columns.
The new journalism is found in every saloon,
gambling den, brothel and water-front dive,
and in nine cases out of ten it is the first re
iief, except a drink, that a jailbird craves
when he has served his time and is about to
be turned loose on the commnniiy.
Tho old journalism is honest, decent, enter
prising, respected and ' profitable, tj The new
journalism shines and smells and smells and
shines like rotten mackerel in the moonlight,

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
The latest addition to the ranks of feminine
composers is Mme. Clara Novello Davies, the
founder and conductor of the Royal Welsh
Ladies' Choir, which took the first prize at the
World's Fair for its singing of Schumann's
"God Is My Guide" and Lassen's "Spanish
Gypsy." Mme. Davies and her band of pretty
Welsh girls are well known intneEast. for
they toured there last year, and will probably
become an annual institution in this country.
In Boston last season the talented leader of the
choir was presented with a beautiful ivory
baton mounted in gold. In Great Britain the
Royal Welsh Ladies' Choir is one of the mu
sical features of the kingdom. Wales is essen
tially a land of song, and it is to song-writing
that Mme. Davies is turning her gifts for com
position. She was born in 1861, and is a dark
eyed, dark-haired, petite, vivacious little
woman, with none of the somber traits that
might be expected from her Calviuistlc par
entage. Her maternal grandtather, the Rev.
MME. CLARA NOVELLO DAVIES, Leader of the Royal Ladies'
Welsh Choir.
William Evans, was a noted and highly re
spected Calvinistic Methodist minister, and
her parents were both musical, especially her
father, Jacob Da vies, who at the age of tweive
conducted a choir of 200 voices. Mme. Davies
made her own debut at 4 years of age, and at
12 she made such a hit as an accompanist that
she was thencefortn engaged for nearly all the
principal concerts in Wales.
A dozen years ago Marie Van Zandt, then in
the height of her fame and so much spoiled
that the public gave her anything she wanted,
undertook to sing the role of Rosina at the
Opera Comiquo and could not finish the
iamous cavatina, some people said because of
a sudden indisposition, others insinuated for
a very different reason. Slie was carried off
the stage by her comrades, and the following
morning Paris had shattered its idol of the
night before. The public would not hear the
little American's name pronounced. The n.xt
year Caivalho, director of the Oper* Comique,
remembering the fine receipts which the
singer had onte brought him in, tried to bring
her back to grace, but the Parisian press was
aggressive, the public rlercely indignant.
Carvalho knew tho changeableness of hutaan
thought. He waited twelve years, and this
time he has bn tight Van Zandt back in
triumph. If the talented artist vÂ«s really not
fit lobe named, by ucclamation, president of
all the temperance societies in tiie world, bow
can she possibly have preserved through so
many years the infantine freshness and purity
of her voice? You only have to go the Opera
Comique to be assured thut she has done so.
Her present success has in it something of the
nature of a reparation.â Le Monde lUustre.
Plunkett Green, the well-known vocalist,

self," said the singer, "I received a letter from
a lady, the secretary of a charity, who asked
me if I would come ana play at an entertain
ment 'some of the pianoforte pieces you ren
der bo magnificently.' I replied that I was
sorry I was engaged on the date she named,
and that I was afraid the public might not
take so favorable a view of my playing as she
thought. Some time later I met Mr. Borvvick
and tod him the story. He burst into laugh
ter and said: 'Why, tne lady wroje to me ana
asked me to sing some of the songs of which I
was so splendid an exponent.' Mr. Borwick
replied that he would have been most de
lighted to oblige her but for the fact that he
had been singing so much of late that his voice
required a complete rest."
Telegrams from Vienna state that Girardi,
the star oi the Au der Wien and the Carl
Theater, has bad to be taken to an insane
asylum. Overwork and domestic unhapplness
have preyed on t lie distinguished artist's mind
and have given him the hal.ucination that he
is the objict oi relentless persecution. Re
cently, afier a short reconciliation with his
wife, Helcne Odilon, an actress of note, Gi
rardi left bis home and went iv great agitation
to a friend's house to demand shelter and pro
tection. Having obtained it, he at once insti
tuted suit for a divorce from his wife. It is
hoped that rest and medical skill will give
back to the theater the most perfect portrayer
of Viennese character and to Johann Strauss
his most genial interpreter.
Every one interested in Massenet's operas
knows that the "Herodiade," just like the
works of so many other French composers,
received its first representation on nny stag**
at the Monnaie Theater, iv Brussels. Each

the first performance of his work occurs,
Massenet, wherever he may be, sends to the
directors oi the Monnaie the following letter:

remembrance and my must affÂ«itiooace bÂ»dU

The prize of Rome at the Paris Conserva
tory has been awarded to Alfred Bachelet, for
his operatic setting of an Irish legend whicli
was written in dramatic form by Leon
Durocher. The libretto, which is mythical,
deals with the adventures of Tiona, the
shepherdess; Flathal, the wicked fairy of the
forests; Patrick, the hunter; Turl, the dwarf,
and Tregar, the enchantress. The plot deals
with the eternal conflict between pure and
sensual love, and around ths little opera Alfred
Bachelet has written such charming music
that he is marked as a rising composer.

It is a growing fad in Europe to give recitals

the "Campaign Song" recital, at which the

DANGER OF FA.S IN EDUCATION.
Detroit Free Prejs.
While this age is fortunate in the enjoyment
of advanced theories aud methods of educa

erating into a mere pursuit of fadsâ a striving
for external ornament at the expense of in
ternal worth, nowers without, fruit, nusks
without kernels. The primary end of educa
tion is to til the child lor lito's duties. That
end cannot be attained by smoothing away
every difficulty thai vu e s before him nor by
diluting vis mental powers with a multitude
of accomplishments merely ornamental.

EARLY DAYS IN KANSAS.
Washington Post.
"Many people are unaware," said Repre
sentative Curtis of Kansas yesterday, "'that
Kansas .had a shibboleth in border - State
times. In 1854, when tho first tide of New-
England settlers began to drift into the South
west, it is related that the Missourians tied a
cow at each crossing of the Missouri River.
When an emigrant arrived at the crossiug he
was certain to make some remurKs about tho
animal. If he saia 'cow' he was suffered to
cross, but if he said 'keow' he was hustled out
of the country as v bloody - minded aboli
tionist. In retaliation for this the Kansans
tied a bear on their side of the river and when
an emigrant crossed who called it 'bear' ho
was welcomed with open arms, but if he pro
nouueed it 'bar' he whs scooted back into Mis
souri as an unwelcome slavery advocate."
A SIXTEENTH-STBEET fIESTA,
Plans of the Improvement Club for a

The Sixteenth-street Improvement Club
held a meeting last night 2909 Sixteenth
street and appointed a committee to visit
merchants and property-owners alon*
Sixteenth street for the purpose of further
interesting them in the extension of the
work of the ciub. The present purpose is
to have more arc lights up and down the

away with the cobblestone pavement ana
substitute bitumen, but that is an object
not so easily attainable.
The committee consists of Thomas O.
Dwyer, Fred Kaabe and Paul Sperling.
During this; week five more arc lights,
suspended midway of the thoroughfare,
wil! be placed on Sixteenth street, be
tween Valencia and Guerrero.
Next Sunday forenoon the club will
confer with the Mission Turn Verein
relative to its prospective majquernde
ball, the date of which will at that time
be decided upon by ihe Turn Verein. The
proposition is for the Turn Verein to
combine iis celebration with a night fiesta
proposed by the improvement ciuo, so
that the inasqueraders on their way to
their i.all may pr menade Sixteenth street

RED ROUGH HANDS^^^^l"^
SAYS SOCIALISM
IS NOT ANARCHY
Rev. Bliss on Current Con
ceptions of That Sys
tem of Government.
His Address Be'ore the Socialist
Labor Party Last
Night.
Socialism Means Practical and Peace*
fill Revolutionâ Bakurin and
Marx Compared.
Rev. McD. P. Bliss was the guest of the
Socialist Labor party last night, under
whose auspices he delivered an address at
the Turk-street Temple. The Rev. J. E.
Scott presided by special request and the
Rev. William Hall Moreland of St. Luke's
Church also occupied a seat upon the
platform.
Rev. Mr. Bliss, on rising, was accorded
a most cordial reception. "Brothers and
|isters and comrades of the Socialist Labor
party," he said, "if 1 am Here as an Epis
copal minister, I am also here as a political
socialist, and 1 desire to tell you freeh
and frankly what I think we should do :n
order to realize socialism. lam net sure
that I agree with all of you. Socialism,
you know, stands for free thought, fee
manhood, and each man has a right to
think his own thoughts, and on the broad
platform of the Socialist Labor party 1
have the right to differ from you. To
night, however, I wish to tell you jvhat I
mean by Christian socialism.
" True socialism is of the whole bodyâ
of the head, of tue heart, and when it
comes to vote, of the hand. Christian so
cialism emphasizes the socialism of the
heart. It is not opposed to political so
cialism or to Fabian socialism, or to any
other kind. It simply says that as a part
of socialism we must have the socialism
of the heart. The phrase Christian social
ism has two factorsâ that of Christ and
Christianity and of straight socialism. By
Christian socialism I do not mean milk
and water socialism, but rather the Social
ist Labor party in the true spirit of Jesua
Christ.
"Tbe purely economic part of socialism
is not anarchy, with all due respect to tiie
"Republican and Democratic papers, but
tbe foe of anarchy, while plutocracy is the
friend of anarchy. In those countries of
Europe where there is most socialsm there
is least anarchy. Germany, Belgium, i
England and Switzerland are leading in |
socialism, and they are not the countries
in which men are throwing bombs and j
making dynamite. In tne same ratio as i
you develop socialism you prevent
anarchy, and just so far as you 'down'
socialism you develop anarc; y. At the
same time socialism is revolutionary, but
it is practical revolution, and therefore of
tne he.-d and not of force."
Mr. Bliss traced the rise and growth of
socialism during the last half century.
He drew a parallel between the destruc
tive propaganda of Bakurin and the
theories of Karl Marx. The latter, though
quite as revolutionary as those pro- j
pounded uy the Russian anarchist, pro- j
posed a radically different method, viz., j
revolution by evolution. The world soon |
recognized that Bakurin's theories were i
not praciical, and that anarchy could not j
create the co-operative commonwealth.
To-day, therefore, anarchistic commun
ism was dead. Marx, on the other hand, I
turned the socialistic wave into a law- I
abidinz channel, and his name was hon- I
ored by hundreds while Bakurin's was J
honored by only one.
"Socialism," said ,t' c lecturer, "is the
foe ot paternalism. It is not the expan
sion of the State as some people thins.
Nor are National railroads, nor municipal
local transit necessarilj' socialism. Social
ism rather depends upon who Uncle Sam
is. In Toronto, for example, I was told
that they preferred an Albert Edward
limited to an Andrew Carnegie un
limited. "
All true socialists, such as Owen,
Fourier, St. Simon, Engels, Lassalle,
Bebel, William MorriÂ«. Marx, Maurice,
Charles Hughes and Kingsley were, he
Insisted, essentially democrats and foes of
paternalism, and the socialists of France
opposed land nationalization, because
they were not satisfied that the Govern
ment was really the people. Socialism
was essentially fraternal. He drew a care
ful distinction between a nominal and a
genuine democracy, and stated his convic
tion that nowhere in Europe, except per
haps in Russia, would Debs have been so
unfairly treated as in America. The Â»"acts j
of modern history were a contradiction of j
the everyday assertion that socialism was i
an impracticable dream.
In Germany 1,800,000 persons voted for
the party and the present position sug
gested a game of chess between the people
and the Kaiser, in which, Mr. Bliss added,
the people bad checkmate. Both in Bel
gium and England tbe outlook was equally
promising.
"Socialism then," continued Mr. Bliss,
"is tbe co-operative commonwealth, the
ownership and operation of land and capi
tal by the people united collectively."
He admitted that its complete realiza
tion must be gradual, and in different
countries its evolution would assume dif
ferent forms. It wou'd be necessary to
educate, agitate and organize, and this
agitation, organization and education
must have as wide a scope as possible.
Socialism meant the true triumph of indi
viduality, and it was because ne believed
in tbe free lorn of tho individual that he
was a socialist.
ANNA JOHNSON'S DEATH.
Dr. C. J. fcharp Charged by the Coro
ner's Jury With Being Respon

OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 6.â An inquest

AINSWORTH A BENEDICT.
He Han Married Miss Ida Murphy of
Oakland.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 6.â The friends of
Captain George K. K. Ainsworth were
much surprised this evening to learn that
ne had taken a bride in the person of Miss
Ida Murphy of Oakland, a young lady 18
years of age.
The couple proceeded to San Francisco
this afternoon, where a marriaee license
was issued to them and the marriage
ceremony performed. The couple have
not returned to Oakland to-night, and are
supposed to spending thrir honeymoon in
San Frauclsco. No one in Oakland
imaeined that Captain Ainsworth contem
plated marriage, his friendship lor Miss
Murphy being looked upon as a sort of a
fatherly regard for her, which she recipro
cated as a daughter would.
Captain Ainsworth is G3 years of age,
and has kept a grocery-store in West Oak
land lor a long time. He is supposed to
be quite well 10 do. Miss Murphy lived
near Captain Ainsworth's store Rnd her
acquaintance with him began some
four months ago, culminating to-day in
her marriage.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 7, 1897.
The Garbage Incinerator Designed by Charles Thackeray.
THE LORING CLUB
IN HARD LUCK
Associate Membership of
the Famous Society-
Dwindling.
Co-Operation Among Cultured
People May Aid the Artis
tic Work.
Active Members Will Carry It On,
and a Committee Will Enlist
Music-Lovers.
There have been rumors that the cele
brated Loring Club, the society choir par
excellence, might be forced to disband.
At the regular monthly meeting; of the
club held last Monday night the gradual
falling off in the associate membership
and consequent deficiency of funds were
discussed, with the result that a commit
tee was appointed to decid* what was
best to do under the circumstances and
devise ways and means of reviving inter
est la the association and building up the
membership.
Another result of the discussion was
the passing of a resolution by almost
unanimous vote tbat the active membersâ
that is, the musicians themselvesâ would
go down into their own pockets for the
money necessary to keep up tne club and
maintain its high standard.
The committee appointed consists of
Messrs. J. J. Morris, E. H. Hueler and
Waiter B. Mackay. They will meet to
morrow night and report to the club at a
meeting to be held Monday night. No
consultation has as yet been had with the
advisory board, and it is expected that
from some of tbe members of it may come
some suggestions which will help to solve
I the difficulties. In any event the decision
has been made to continue the club's ex
istence, and the necessary funds will be
forthcoming.
The active membership of the club,
which consists of the members who sing
in the concerts, has not fallen off at all,
either in numbers or efficiency, but the
associate membership, which consists of
people who subscribe $10 per annum to
enjoy the concerts, has, on account of the
recent hard times, dwindled away from
over UOO members to about 80, and conse
quently their contributions are not suf
ficient to meet the necessary expenses.
These members, in return for their sub
scription?, have four concerts per annum
given them of the highest class, and at
each concert they are furnished four tick
ets to give to their friend-. The club is a
| semi-private one and no one is ad:r,ittÂ»d
I to the concerts but the subscribers and
I their iriends, consequently the diminish
ing of the association membership has
endangered the club's existence.
It is considered by the thoughtful much
to be regretted that an organization which
has done such excellent work in ti.e past
should not be supported by the people of
San Francisco with a membership large
enough to maintain the club at the same
high standard which was set by Mr.
Loring when he built it up. It has an
active membership of sixty highly trained
male voices, and they are capable ot giv
ing a hrst-cless rendition of the finest
music composed by any ot the great mas
ters. It is an organization of musical
talent of which this or any city might be
proud, but Mr. Loring says that it is ap
pareutly much more appreciated by music
lovers in the East, who have enjoyed the
concerts while visitinc here, than it is by
its own people. According to him it seems
to be a case of a prophet not being with
out honor save in* his own country. Nearly
every one of the well-trained musicians is,
or has been, a member of it, and gained
his standing as a musician largely through
means of that meniDership.
In some of tee concerts given in the
past they were assisted by tue Schumann
Club of sixty female voices. In others
they have had a full orchestra, and have
given the subscribers musical treats which
j cost $700 for the single performance. From
this it can readily be seen how necessary
it is to revive interest in the club and join
its associate subscribers if this deserving
factor in the culture of the City is to be
maintained in its pristine excellence.
David W. Loring, who founded the club
twenty years ago, is a tine musician, and
he says the voices are all of a high order,
and that their training in singing to-
I gether In perfect unison is deserving of
far more appreciation than Ban Francisco
gives them. The renditions of the finest
and most difficult music which they have
given would do credit to Boston or any of
the big centers of civilization. Mr. Lorinjf,
who was the musical director for eighteen
year?, has recently returned from Japan,
where he spent two years. He is very de
sirous of seeing interest in the club re
newed.
The present officers are: William Qreer
Harrison, president; Charles F. Crocker,
vice-president; W. 0. Stadtfeld, secretary;
W. H. Murison, treasurer. The musical
director is D. P. Hughes, and the ad
visory board consists of William Alvord,
James D. Phelan, Mrs. William Alvord
and Mrs. L. L. Baker.
Kecovered From the Bay.
The body of an unknown man was found
floating in the bay off Lombard-street wharf
by the Harbor Police yesterday. It was re
moved to the Morgue. The features were de
stroyed past recognition by the action of the
water. The man had been well dressed in a
black cutaway suit. He wore cork-soled boots.
In the pockets of the garments were an open
face French watch, chain, nail lile and a com
mon knife.
ITS CHIMNEY WILL
BE A LANDMARK
Towering Feature of the
New Crematory for
Garbage.
It Will Be 250 Feet High and
Visible All Over This City
and Oakland.
Largest Incinerator Plant in the
World to Be Erected at a Cost
of $100,000.
The garbage crematory wnich will soon
be built in this City is the same as that
which has been in successful operation in
the city of Montreal for the past foor
years. It will be built under the superin
tendency of the inventor of the Montreal
plant, Charles Thackeray.
The building will be of brick and iron,
two stories high. It has a frontage of 262
feet by a depth of 120 feet. The chimney
is the i'eraarkable feature of the works.
It will be 250 feet high and will be seen
from all party of the City and Oakland.
Its base is 43 feet and the flue is 14 feet
diameter inside measurement. There will
be thirty-two furnaces, which will permit
thirty-two scavenger's carts driving into
the building ana dumping the garbage
into the furnaces at one time. The
furnaces are so arranged that they may
be all in operation at the same time or
only a portion of them, as the quantity of
the garbage delivered may require.
Ttie block of land just purchased by the
corporation will oe inclosed with a nigh
; fence. No odors whatever will emanate
Iroin the burning of the garbage, as the
combustion and temperature of the fur
naces is sufficient to overcome ali such
difficulties and one other feature being
e-pecially adapted lor this purpose, that
is. tiu; down draught with the powerful
I suction of the chimney causes all the
! odors, etc.. to b-? drawn down into the
furnaces and passed over the hottest
place of the furnace. The temperature,
ranging from 1500 to 2ooo degrees, is suffi
cient to consume and purify alt and any
odors that may arise. The garbage burns
itself, no fuel whatever being required.
There are also arranaed in this plant
four very large boilers, which will give
sufficient steam power for the company's
own private uses for electric light and lor
other incidental uses such as the manu
facture of fireproo; material for the fire
proofing of our modern buildings and the
production of fertilizer and several other
such things which the company has the
intention of taking up in the near future.
After the buildings have been completed
and are in operation the company intends
to so improve its own estate That it will
be a great benefit to the surrounding dis
trict and also a credit to the City of San
Francisco.
This will be the largest incinerator plant
in the world, as ali other plants in Amer
ica and Europe have a capacity from 30 to
150 tons per day and this plant has a total
capacity of 400 tons in tne same time.
At a meeting of the board of directors
held yesterday, President L. R. Eilert
being in the chair and a full board present.
Secretary A. Sbarboro read the following
list of successful bidders, to whom were
awarded the contracts for the erection of
the building: Brick work, Owen E. Brady
& Son ; carpenter work, MacconO & Rosso ;
iron work, including four California-made
boilers, J. Hendy Machine WorKs; roofing,
Conlin & Roberts.
The bids aggregate nearly $100,000. The
building will be erected on a block of land
near the present dumps: Ffrst, for the
reason that it is easy of access to the
scavengers, and second, for the further
reason that although the plant will be
worked with such neatness that it will
not be more detrimental than the United
States mint, still the board of director?,
desiring to avoid any possible cause of
complaint, have selected a place in the
future manufacturing district, so that
they can furnish facilities with their sur
plus steam power to the factories in their
vicinity.
It is understood that a meeting of the
scavengers will soon be called, at which
it is expected that satislactory arrange
ments will be mads by which the scaven
gers will all retain their present position
and their present condition bo amelior
ated.
The burning of garbage has been found
to be the best and most economical dis
posal of cities' refuse. The works at Los
Angeles have been in successful opera
tion for some time, and lately Portland,
Or., and San Diego, Cal. , have also con
cluded to burn their garbage.
When the works will be in successful
operation they will give employment to a
large number of laborers and be a credit
to the City of San Francisco.
A HIT OF THE SEASON.
The Great Sale Inaugurated by Call
leau's Cloak House.
Last Saturday Mr. Armand Calllean, corner
Geary street and Grant avenue, announced
that he would retire from the cloak and suit
business. Since the announcement the finest
stock of ladies' wear has been cut to little or
nothing. The outcome of this is that all the
different styles of capes, cloaks, dresses, even
in? wraps and furs are going like wildfire.
Ladies desiring to see the excitement need
only go to the store and look at tha crowd
waiting to get the many bargains. *

FEE BILL FOUND
INVALID IN PART
In Other Respects It Is
Declared to Be Com
petent.
Justices and Constables Win
Their Cases in the State
Supreme Court.
Gen?ral Joy Among Township Officers
Who Decided in Convention
to Test the Law.
The case of William Dwyer against W.
*'. Parker, Auditor of Santa Clara County,
and also tbe case of Edward Haley against
W. F. Parker were decided in the Supreme
Court yesterday. These cases brought
into question the constitutionality of the
fee bill. Dwyer claimed $141 fees due him
as a Justice of the Peace, and Haley
claimed fees as a constable. The court de
cided, the first case in favor of Dwyen
Tbe other case followed the decision in the
Dwyer case.
Justice Henshaw, writing the opinion,
found that the question involved was the
constitutionality of the act entitled "An
act to establish the fees of county and
township officers and other officials and
of jurors and witnesses within this State."
The act of 1895 proceeded to establish fees
which justices of the peace may charge
and collect, but limited the amount which
they may retain as follows: For all ser
vices rendered in a criminal action or pro
ceeding, whether on examination or trial,
?3, provided that no more than the sum of
$75 shall be allowed out of the county
treasury in misdemeanor cases to any one
justice.
Counsel for Dwyer claimed that these
and other provisions in tne act are uncon
stitutional, and that t^ey are inseparable
parts of the whole act, which must there
fore be declared invalid. Justice Hen
shaw did not take this sweeping view of
the matter. v He found that certain parts
of the act are unconstitutional. Tne
county government act, which was parsed
by the Legislature in 1893, provided for
classifying Counties according to popula
tion and regulated the compensation of
all county and township officers according
to their duties.
"It is apparent," said Justice Hensbaw.
â¢'tdat the county government act oi 1893
and the act of 1895, to establish the fees of
county and township officers, both under
take to fix the compensation of Justices of
the Peace and Constable-, and there is no
connist between the provisions in this re
gard.
"The constitution has provided that the
Legislature shall regulate the compensa
tion of all county and township officers in
proportion to the duties that they may
perform. The conviction is irresistible
that the constitution has fixed a singie
mode which must be adopted or followed
in fixing the compensation of officers, and
tliat mode is to adjust the compensation
in accordance with their respective duties,
under a classification of counties by popu
lation made for this purpose."
Further on Justice Henshaw said that
the Legislature is forbidden to pass any
local or special law affecting ices or sala
ries of any officer. By the act of 1895 the
Legislature, unmindml of this constitu
tional provision, passed a law applicable
to all county and township officers, declar
ing the amount of fees wUicu they were
entitled to charge and collect from the
citiz-n for the performance of their speci
fied duties. But in the instances enumer
ated it attempted to go further than this,
and to fix or regulate the compensation of
offenses to the classification made in the
county government act of 1893. This is
far beyond the power of the Legislature
to do, and tiie provisions oi the act which
undertake t* do this are illegal and in
valid.
Tbe Justice did not find, however, that
the whole act is void. With certain excep
tions it remains a full and complete lee
bill. The contention of Dwyer that his
compensation is regulated by the county
government act was found to b? sound,
Justices Harrison, Van Vieet, McFarland
and Temple concurred.
TOWN OFFICERS GLAD.
Rejoicing at San Jose Over the Test
Case Outcome.
SAN JOSE, Cai,., Jan. 6.â Judge Dwyer
and Constable Haley to-day received word
through their attorneys, F. E. Spencer
and D. W. Burchard, that the new fee bill
which was enacted by the Legislature of
two years ago and which aroused such
consternation among the justices and con
stables of the State had been declared un
constitutional by the Supreme Court.
The decision just rendered is on appeal
from the Superior Court of this county in
the cases of Constable Haley and Justice
Dwyer against the county for ices under
the old county government act. The
suits were the result of action derided
upon at a convention of township officers
held in Justice Dwyer's courtroom in this
city nearly two years ago. Justice Dwver
was the promoter of the movement, and
the meeting held in this city was attended
by justices ana constables from all the
bay counties and as far south as San Luis
Obispo. The officers affected will now be
entitled to bacfc fees.
The constables and justices all wore
happy faces to-day, and Judge Dwyer was
the recipient of many congratulations on
the outcome of his fiirht.
NOT A CLUB LIGHT.
Pacific Street lUmuinated With Elec
tricity by tbe Exertions of
Chris Bruge.
Chris Bruse, who keeps a grocery on
the corner of Pacific and Leavenworth
streets, has started the agitation for more
light on Pacific street, by erecting arc
lamps between Hyde and Leavenworth.
Associated with him in this iiove of prog
ress are Charles Oswald, B.Frank, Bluhm
& Rathjen and a few others.
They undertook to raise funds necessary
to keep the block well lighted, and they
secured the following signatures to a sub
scription to have three arc lights erected
in the block mentioned: Chris Bruse,
grocer; Herman Ktauenberg, barber:
George Saver. baker; P. S. Back, dairy
produce; Charles Oswald, butcher; B.
Frank, dry goods; Bluhm & Rathjens,
pork packers; Vennefcohl Bros., grocers;
W. Lonohimo, druggist; Garibaldi Bros.,
fruit store; John Eckelinan, plumber; M.
Goodenougb, jeweler; Kennedy Bros.,
grocers; G. Mockel. furniture, D. Bada
racco, saloon; A. Wrede, property owner;
St. Dennis, property owner; F. Pistoiesi,
property owner; F. Tillman, property
owner.
With the subscriptions from those per
sons the lights are guaranteed for the next
six months, and that block bus suddenly
loomed into prominenc3 as being a lively
section leading into Polk street.
A Question <>l Jc'uylng Duty.
Within the next lew days a case of more or
less interest in commercial circles will be
heard before the United States Commissioner.
Some time ago the Southern I'acific Company
received two consignments ol creosote oils
and other tar acids. The railroad company
contends that at the time of the importation
these articles were entitled to be entered free
of duty under the coal-tar act. Collector Wise
and the General Board of Appraisers held that
these articles are subject to pay duty as dis
tilled oils. The railroad company has ap
pealed frcm this decision and the Commii.
siouers will tase tes-.imony.
NO CAUSE FOR ACTION.
The Supreme Court Finds Against Fran-'
cesca Ih de Martin in Her Suit
Against Alice Phelan.
The Supreme Conn has decided that
Francesca L. de Martin had no cause for
action against Alice Phelan et Â»L, execu
tors of the last will of James Phelan, de
ceased. The suit brought by Francesca
L. de Martin was given publicity at the
time it was begun. She alleged that on
November 4, 1881, she owned land subject
to mortgage which was of the value of
$390,375, upon which James Phelan held
mortgages amounting to $196,000. She
had, she alleged also, at that time, thir
teen children and she was in indigent cir
cumstances, destitute of available means
of support, in great need, and unable to
secure an additional loan upon the land or
to sell the same.
She also alleged that Phelan, desiring tr>
take advantage of her necessities, offered
her first $4000, then $10,000 and then $19,
--000 for her equity in the property, making
these offers on successive days, and that,
in the meantime, Phelan had advertised
the property for sale under an execution
upon a decree of foreclosure, but had the
sale postponed repeatedly for the purpose
of securing her equity of redemption for
less than its value. She also alleged that
she finally yielded to threat*, and on Jan
uary 4, 1881, accepted the offer of $19,000.
Phelan hud fully intended, sheaverred, to
offer $45,000 .if he could not get the equity
for Jess.
The opinion of the Supreme Court waa
written by Justice Temple. It was found
therein that the complaint^constitutes no
cause of action. "It is impossible to be
lieve," said Justice Temple, "that counsel
are serious in their contention that it con
stituted fraud or oppression upon the part
of Phelan to conceal from her the faci
that he intended to off er her as much as
$45,000 for her equity if he could not get it
for less."
The court also found that the relations
between the parties were in no sense fidu
ciary. The sale, even after the decree was
obtained, was not hastened. "I can dis
cover no element of fraud, oppression or
unfairness in the case," said Justice Tem
ple in conclusion. The judgment Jroni
which an appeal was taken was therefore
affirmed.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
I Some Attractions That Draw Large
Houses â Programme of the Nordica-
Scalchi Concert.
"The Old Homestead" is drawing satis
factory audiences at the Baldwin. The
quartet and choir-singing are especially
enjoyed.
The next dramatic attraction at the
Baldwin will be Modjeska, who will open
j on the 25th inst. in "Magda."
The members of the Joseph Murphy
I company at the Columbia are rapidly re
covering from their recent indisposition.
The star himself was not well enough to
act last night and may not be able to do
so ior some days; meanwhile his brother
wMI supply his place.
Next week the company will present
"Kerry Gow."
"In the Name of the Czar," at the
Grand, is a melodrama that teems with
sensation and has concessions to the more
cheerful popular taste in the stiape of a
comic Irish groom and a French maid,
who sing comic songs and generally
j enliven the gloom of life among anar-
I chists' oppressors. The comic songs are
aIJ hailed with delight and are nightly
encored. Leslie Morosco has a sym
pathetic part as the American, who always
bobs up serenely in time to rescue his
friend when he is at the Jast gasp, and
Mortimer Snow takes kindly to the part of
the friend who is rescued. "In the Name
of the Czar" is well staged and the all
| around caste v satisfactory.
The double bill at the Alcazar is attract
; ing well this week. The curtain-raiser is
i prettily acted and "A Serious Tangle" is
one of those bright and frothy comedies
which amuse an audience without taxing
any one's mental capabilities.
"Jack and the Beanstalk" continues to
tax the seating capacities of the Tivoli.
Next week the second edition of the bur
lesque containing a number of new spe
: cialties will be presented.
The Orpheam's really strong bill isreap
ing its reward in the shape of uacked
houses. All the new acts have taken well,
though the ballets still remain the chief
attraction.

PICTURED STORM
AND DISASTER
Remarkable Voyage of
the British Ship
Blackbraes.
She Left England Fourteen
Months Ago and Only
Arrived Yesterday.
Sprung a Leak While Rounding Cape
Horn, acd Had to Fat Back
to Montevideo.
The British ship Blackbraes met with
more than the average number of misfor
tunes during her voyage from Liverpool
to San Francisco. She left the former
port on November 8, 1895, and reached her
destination yesterday. Durinc the four
teen months she was en route a succession
of gales were encountered that twice dis
abled the vessel. Once she put back to
Birkenhead, and when rounding the Horn
the storms were so severe that many of
the men were disabled, and the vessel had
to put about and run for Montevideo. On
arriving at that point all hands were at
the pumps, and the cargo had to be dis
charged and the vessel docked for repairs.
Captain Chisholm's account of the voy
age is brief but to the point. It is as fol
lows:
Sailpd from Liverpool November 8, 1895.
Had a succession of heavy southeasterly gales,
â¢which did considerable damage, and bad to
put back to Eirkenhead for repairs. Whhe
lviiiz in the dock ;he Blackbraes was run into
l>"y a steamship. We repnired damages and
sailed again on January 20, 1890. Had south
erly winds to lat. 27 X. and then took the
northeast trades in lat 27 N. and carried them
to lat. 3N. Crossed the equator in long. 2S
\Y. and took the southeast trades in lat. 2 I\.
and carried them to 15 S.
Had variable winds to the River Platte and
then had a succession of southerly and west
erly gales. Had southwesterly gales to Staien
April 9th to 17th off Staten Island. Had
northerly and southwesterly gales.
April i 9, oS Cape Horn, hud a heavy hurri
cane from north-northwest to south-southwest, j
lastiug twenty hours, throwing the ship on her
beam ends, shifting the cargo and blowing
away a complete set of sails. Broke about
thirty deck stanchions and carried away bQth
forward boats and started the deckhouse and
carried away the port main rail, also doing
considerable damage to rudder and steering
Had a succession of westerly gales until
April 23, when we had a very he avy gale to
the westward of the Diego Rameriez, when the
BhiD spruue a leak, starting the decks, the
salt water going through the cargo and into
the fresh water-tank.
Headed the ship for Falkland Islands. Ar
rived off the islands on May 13, when we had
o. heavy south-souiherst gale, and not having
sail enough to hold the ship up, had to keep
off for Montevideo, and arrived at Montevideo
ou May 28, when we discharged a large por
tion oi the cargo, repnired the ship and loaded
all the cargo with the exception oi about 250
tons oi salt. Sailed October 15. Had head
winds to Cape Horn; off Cape Horn had
strong southwest gales and blew away several
sails; hud head winds to latitude 45 south,
longitude 82 west; had southwest winds to
laiitude 33 south; took the southeast trades
in latitude 33 south, and carried them to lati
tude U north; crossed the equator .December
10, longitude 117:30 west; took the northeast
trades m latitude 9 north and carried them to
latitude 30 north; had southerly and north
east winds to port.
One of the apprentices on tne Black
braes kept a log of each clay's doings and
he thus describes the time all on board
had when the vessel was rounding the
Horn. After recounting the incidents
that had gone before lie says:
Weil, we are .".gain settling down in ease and
transport. But hush, listen! What is that
mournful sound thst cm be heard in the dis
tance? Nearer and nearer it approaches and
seems to revel in tlie water below. Stormy
spirits are awakening in the heavens! The
elements seem to combine in their fury with
the roar of the ccean. The unanimous uin be
gpeaks a storm. Ah, it is suddenly upon us!
Order after order is issued and is as quietly
executed. "Let go" this rt>pe; ''pull on" the
other; "haul on" that; "reel" this sail ; "furl"
that; tug, pull, haul until we are ready to full
on the deck with exhaustion.
Fiercer and fiercer the wind the sea doth
laÂ»h until it rolls mountains high. The dark
ness seems to augment the storm. As the ship
is put under lighter canvas she begins to roll.
fcea after sea comes over her rails and we are
washed about like straws on a mighty curreut.
SÂ»il after sail is carried away, torn into rib
bons Defore we can do nnythiug to save them.
But at last we conquer and are ploughing
through a mighty head sea under three top
sails and foresail. All that can possibly be
uone is done and we ure allowed a rest.
The starboard watch are all asleep in their
bunks. One of the port watch is laid up with
a broken arm.
It is bitterly co.d; every rope, every wire,
in fact all, is a solid mass of ice. The snow
and hail that are driven by the wind are
enough to cause you to perish.
It is about 1 o'clock in the morning. Hor
rors! The ship is suddenly struck by a ter
rific sea and is almost at a standstill She
trembles like a leaf in a gentle breeze.
Her bow is stove in, the strong iron plate
having been bunt, leaving a large nole,
through which rushes a voluminous body of
water.
When the sea struck her the water breaks
over the house with such force as to strain our
ports and lift open oiu* skylights, letting in a
learlul body 01 water. The poor and weary
womout lads who are in their bunks are
nearly drowned. Bedcovers, mattresses and
clothing of all description are thoroughly
drenched. The lockers on the starboard bow
have been torn down, and paints, bruth.es and
oils, brooms, etc., are to be seen floating in all
directions over the deckâ a fearful sight as we
view it by the aid of a torchlight. The debris
was cleared up as well as could be, ond the
scattered articles are all put away.
Stronger and more terrific growe the gale.
&ea seems to mount sea and throw itself
upainst our gallant ship. The starboard tack
of our foresail is suddenly carried away. Now
It is lurl and make fast that heavy sail. Ob,
that you were there at that time, that you
mipht actually go through i hat bitter experi
ence! Not that I wish to punish you as we
were punished, but that you could experience
actually, and not in imagination, the reckless
bravery required in the carrying on of inter
national Commerce.
All hands on "deck" came the order. Wet
and weary, anxious and exhausted as we were,
the next after wns"ali hands lay aloft." Work,
pull, struggle and wrestle with a spread ol
canvas thai ti)ied itself with wind from that
awful gale; and yet we could not master it.
One. two, three, four, and yet the fifth hour
passes, and we are still struggling with the
same sail.
The bitter wind penetrates us to the very
marrow. Some of us are so badly bitten by
the frost tnat we can stand it uo longer. Strips
of flesh are torn from our hands owing to toe
irantic whipping of the sail in the wind. Un
able to s.aud the torture on the foot-rope any
longer we go down. After resting a few min
utes up we go again. It is daylight, and even
the captain comes up to lend us a hand. What
with a lull, and the aid of daylight, we con
quer: and now it is secure.
You who hU2 the fire, yon who enjoy the full
benefit of a distended stomach, you who can
exchange wet garments for dry ones, you who
go to rest after a day's toil between dry, com
lortable covers and the walls of a cheerful
room, when the storm, the blizzard or snow
squalls are raging, would you exchange places
with us? Would you say you would, even if
we said the marine mercantile trade must
come to a standstill so far as we are con
cerned?
Wnen I tell you that there were three-fourths
of an inch of frost on the bulkheads of our
io'castle, that we wore gaunt from hunger,
tiiat for five long weeks we wade-i in salt
water, and turned inâ as we call going to rest
Jn our bunks â with wet garments on, and
came out again from that cold, restless couch
to put on those same wet garments, let this
sound as it will to you, yet I tell you that it is
unpainted truth.
I imagine I see you turn to the above pic
ture, and as you see sea after sea hurl Itself
over the rails, filling the snip to her utmost
capacity, please remember that we were
clutching, grasping, struggling for a rope,
pin, wire or anything, lest we be washed
through a porthole or over the side.

and Captain Chisbolm determined to
make it "a merry Christmas" for his men
if possible. A pig was Killed and all on
board had fresh meat, while the cook pro
vided a regular English plum pudding.
Every man on board put a donation into a
list of prizes to be contested for, but as ail
save the officers were out of money
the list read something like this: One-half
pound tobacco; 1 plug tobacco, 2]4 pound?

potato and spoon race, hop, skip anil
jump, sack rscs, 200-yard flat race, three

he has been paying out the prizes ever
wince Christmas day. The officers all gave
money prizes and toe fortunate winners
are cow awaiting a chance to get shore
leave.
The Blackbraes will remain in the
stream a few dnys and then, after an In
spection, the chances are a general aver

MUTINY ON THE BELFORD.
The Men Rtfused to Co to Work
Until They Got Their Advance.
There was trouble on the British ship
Belford yesterday, and at one time it
looked as though the police would be
called in. Captain McKinnon had shipped
what is known along the water front as a
"scab crew." The men went at a lower
rate than is demanded by the regular
shipping masters, and also agreed to go
without an advance. Yesterday they de
manded an advance and the captain re
fused. Then the trouble began. The men
refused to work, and the officers were or
dered to put them in irons. The sailors
rel used to be ironed, and a free fight al
most followed. When the A. ii.'s at
tempted to quit the ship in a body Cap
tain McKinnon capitulated and agreed to
pay the advance. Late in the afternoon
the men went to work and bent the sails,
and some time to-day the Beiford will get
away with her load of wheat for Algoa
Bay.
"Abe" Marks, the popular clerk in the
Merchants' Exchange, had a narrow
escape yesterday. A professional beggar
was plying his trade among the mer
chants who ceneraily congregate on the
floor about 1 p. M.,wiien Mr. Maries caught
sight of him. He wasted no words, but
taking a firm hold of the intruder, started
to march him out. Passing the second
door, he met Officer Walsh and turned his
prisoner over to him. Later in the day
Walsh remarked to At>e: "You had a nar
row escape; that was the man that nearly
kicked my Drains out a year ago."
It appears that the loafer had zone into
an insurance office on California street
and asked for enough to set a meal. He
was given a ticket that entitled him to a
meal and a bed, out as soon as be reached
the sidewalk he tore it in two and {brew
it away. Then he made a bee line for the
Produce Exchange.
Walsh picked up tbe ticket, and seeing
what it was. followed thÂ«! man. Finding
him begging, be placed him under arrest.
The prisoner walked to the police patrol
box without making any resistance, but
before the wagon arrived be showed fight.
He bit and kicked, and for weeks Walsh
bore the marks of bis feet on his forehead,
while his helmet was ruined. "Abe" is
now thanking bis lucky stars that the
trump did not tackle him.
The British ship Helga arrived from
Cape Town yesterday in ballast. The voy
age was an uneventful one. On December
15, in latitude 5 deg. 17 mm. north, longi
tude 124 deg. 46 mm. west, Jacob Palmer,
a native of Finland, died suddenly of
heart disease, and was buried at sea.
The water-front burglars visited the big
tug Fearless last Tuesday night, They
get away with a suit of Captain Clem
Randall's clothes, a gold watch and chain
belonging to the first officer, and nearly
ail the clothing belonging to the crew.
Tbe men who did the work must be ex
perts, as the vessel was robbed while the
sailors were asleep in their bunks.
Tbe tug Vigilant will take a valuable
consignment to the Farralones to-day.
Miss Doud, the young lady teacher, will
be the guest of Captain John Silovich,
and forty-six carrier pigeons for use on
the island will also go out. The young
iady will teach the children of the light
house-keepers their A B O'g and the
pigeoiii will carry news for tbe Weather
Bureau. Two at a time they will be ro
reieased from their cotes, and they are
expected to return to their home in
Berkeley, whence the weather news wiil
be telephoned to the head office in the
Mills building.
Officer George Lake of the Harbor police
is back on duty again. He was prostrated
for three weeks with a severe attack of la
grippe.
Ed Gordon, owner of the plunger
George Washington, says that the parties
who went out on tbe memorable cruise
recorded in The Call yesterday morning
were Miss Emma Johnson, Miss Katie
Wilson, William Smith and himself.
Gordon asserts that his lady friends
missed the boat and that he and Smith
volunteered to sail them over to San
Francisco.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 7, 1897.
HEADS CUT OFF
BY SUPERVISORS
Solid Seven Makes 62 Va
cancies and 62 New
Appointments.
Struggle Last Night of a Plucky
Minority With a United
Majority.
Supervisor Clinton and His Faithful
Four Kick Hard, but Very
Futilely.
The "solid seven" were invincible at the
adjourned meeting of the Board of Super
visors last night. Every time Supervisor
Clinton, Supervisor Dodge or other mem
ber of the minority which has been left out
in weather (which is very xhilly with
respect to patronage) showea their head
the "solid seven" stood shoulder to
shoulder and whacked it into submission â
every time but once.
Then Delaney broke over to the support
of the position taken by Dodge, and all
tne others followed with the activity of
sheep vaulting over a burn door and fall
ing safely on ths other side. The ''solid
seven" carried all the committees and
sixty-two political jobs for new members
of the laithful through to a successful
finish.
There was a preliminary caucus, the
result of which appeared in the session,
and the board was not called to order till
8:20 o'clock.
Mayor Phelan was in the chair, spick,
span and artistic, with his new improve
ment club gavel. The board had its first
real taste of Pheian as a presiding officer
and it was smooth and slick. The Mayor
understands the job of chairman. He is
quick and decisive. Dr. Clinton worried
the parliamentary cat some during the
evening, but not once waa his master
compelled to show the length of his claws.
If there 13 any one thing for which the
lirst formal business session of the board
will not be distinguished in history it is
harmony-rexcept with the "solid seven,"
where it was beautiful and seraphic.
Every member of the new board was
present.
The first trouble in tbe divided 'board
appeared in the' appointment and con
firmation of committees. Supervisor
Rottanzi is the uncompromising general
of the "solid seven" and Supervisor Clin
ton is the leader of the "opposition," with
.1 faithful lieutenant in Supervisor Dodge.
The ''solid seven" are: Supervisors Rot
tanzi, Haskins, Delaney, Devany,
Sheehan, Britt and Rivers. The mass of
the minority is embodied in Supervisors
Clinton, Dodge, Lackmann, Morton and
Smith.
A petition 'from the Women's Educa
tional and Industrial Association offering
to provide women to clean the City Hall
for $1200 a month, where the work now
costs $2000, innocently precipitated the
battle. It was referred to the Public
Buildings Committee.
Supervisor Clinton jumped disgruntled
into the fray. He said his memory failed
to recall that the board had any commit
tees, and he moved that action on the pe
tition be deferred and the appointment of
committees taken up. This prevailed.
Then after Rottanzi's motion that the
list of committees .is read at the inaugural
meeting of the board last Monday be
adopted had carried, there was deep si
lence and bated breath as the clerk read
as follows. Supervisor Clinton saying:
"Will the clerk read slowly so I can copy
them as I don't know anything about
them." The clerk so read :
Judiciaryâ Smith, Rottanzi, Clinton.
Finance aud Audinngâ Kottanzi, Devany,
Hasktns.
Streets, Wharves, Grades and Public Squares
â Devany, Sheehan, Delaney, Britt, Kiver9.
Public' Buildings â bheehan, Britt, Rivers.
Wa;cr and V/ater Supply â Clinton, Rivers,
Dodge, Britt, Morton.
Health and Policeâ Delaney, Rivers, Devany,
Rottanzi, Haskins.
Fire Departmentâ Britt, Sheehan, Devany,
Rottanzi, Morton.
License and Ordersâ Lackmann, Rivers, Has
kinx.
Hospitalsâ Dodge, Rottanzi, Haskins.
Printing and Salariesâ Haskins, Sheehan,
Britt.
Street Lightsâ Rivers, Delaney, Sheehan,
Smith, Lackmann.
Outside Landsâ Morton, Clinton, Dodge,
DeUiney, Lackmann.
Supervisor Clinton then off -red the fol
lowing committees as a substitute:
Finance and Auditingâ Clinton, Dodge and
Lackman.
Street and Wharvesâ Devaney, Bheehan,
Morton, Delaney, Britt.
Public Buildingsâ Sheehan, Morton, Dela
ney.
Water and Water Supply â Rottanzi, Clinton,
Lackmann, Britt, Devany.
Health and Policeâ Delaney, Smith, Rivers,
Rottanzi, Haskins.
Fire Department â Britt, Smith, Shehan,
Rivers, Morton.
Hospitalsâ Dodge, Smith, Rottanzi.
Printing and Salariesâ Haskius, Delaney,
Morton.
i~tn-et Lights â Rivers, Clinton, Devany, Mor
ton, Dodge.
Outside Lands â Morton, Dodge, Clinton,
Haskins, Lachmann.
. The substitute was lost by a vote of 7
to 5. â¢
Dr. Clinton was r not satisfied. ; He
tackled the seriatim plan, of battle next.
He asked' to be permitted to withdraw
from : the Committee on Judiciary and
moved mat the chair fill the vacancy.
This was also lost by : a vote of 7 to 5.
The lobby saw something funny in the
solidity of the seven and laughed moder
ately. This appeared to annoy Supervisor
Clinton, who appealed to the chair in
these words: "
"Can I < be ., forced to serve whether I
want to or not?"
â¢ The Mayor replied diplomatically:
"You can refuse to attend the meeting."
Supervisor Clinton, sat down calmly,
but his eyes were flashing â indeed they
had been exposing subdued fire all even
ing. â  r- : â 'â â â â â  ;â¢ â 
Supervisor Dodge offered as a substitute
for the Finance Committee Supervisors
Clinton, Lackmann and Britt, and was
supported by Clinton. .He subsequently,
however, offered an amendment that Rot
tanzi, Dodge and Haskins compose this
committee. Then he made a speech in
which he said:
"I realize that the success or failure of
our administration depends on this com
mittee. It should be an impartial com
mittee. Of the original committee one
member is also a member of the street
committee and another .of the, printing
committee. Both of these are com
mittees of large appropriations. It ap
pears to me that in the formation of
the original finance committee the Lord's
injunction, 'Lead us not into temptation, 1
was disregarded. I do not wish my fel
low-members to bo tempted in this way,
while, at the same time, I feel the utmost
confidence in their integrity and probity.
I want a committee that will stop ail
leaks."
Supervisor Rottanzi replied, saying he
had the gr3atest; confidence in his fellow
members of the Finance Committee, and
felt that temptation "will be naught to
them. I asked Dr. Dodge," said Rottanzi,
"to serve with me on this committee and
he absolutely declined."
; On coming to the roll-call, both Super
visor Dodge's substitute ; and Supervisor
Clinton's amendment were lost by the
same old vote of 7to 5. .
The Clinton committees were then taken
up seriatim, but in turn met the same (ate.
Before the .; vote Â«- on his Water
and Water Supply Committee , was taken,
Supervisor Clinton said, somewhat bit
terly, that as chairman of that committee
he had been ' accorded the privilege of
naming his associates on the committee,
but he found that the caucus had taken
away the privilege, and he 'had been
denied what*' had been granted to every
other chairman.
Supervisor Dodge made the same com
plaint in regard to the Hospital Com
mittee. ' He lared better â much' better â
than Clinton, though he did not seem to
expect ,' it until he felt the wind blowing
his way in an unmistakable strength.
"1 expected the privilege of naming at
least one man on the committee, but I
have not had it, while the privilege has
been -S given to â ; every \ other * chairman.
Were 1 allowed to choose I should :â  name
Supervisors Dodge, Clinton and Rottanzi."
He moved that the change be made.;
'. The "solid seven" stood up straight
enough till Delaney had a chance. Then
he supported -. the Dodge "i Hospital ; Com
mittee, and every i other member of , the
caucus flew the track after his lead. Smith
alone voted against it, and he appeared to
vote- "no 1 because ;? he 'had" been voting
â¢'no" all night with the minority. / ..
The Dodge committee was confirmed by
a vote of 11 to 1. All the remainder of the
majority's committees were confirmed.
Thus I the three â¢ doctors of the : board re
main on that committee.
L The lobby began' to get uneasy at this
break. â y There was a subdued murmur and
hum ?of : converse. Were not -matters of
much more moment to the "hangers-on"
yet to be decided ? Was not a big batch of
appointments to be made? Could it be pos
sible that the slate was "busted" so that
the gap would not close up again on the
next c vote? These and other queries
thrilled the large and expectant audience. 1
When the resolution declaring sixty -fwo
City Hall offi. es and appointments vacant
was offered Supervisor Clinton opposed it.
He said he did not see any necessity for
making such sweeping changes at one fell
swoop. s&i Ho wanred time ;to h consider.
There were doubtless worthy men 'among
the number to be decapitated. He moved
that the resolution be tabled till the next
meeting. vâ  ; .;;?V. ": vv: ... ; : ". 2-::'''.! - <i' â :' â â 'â 'â¢Â§{;
' -It was a case of kicking against the
pricks again. v The motion lost, the de
capitating resolution prevailed .Â£by,;;- the
vote of 7 to 5. "; The lobby breathed a sigh
of â¢ relief, for the 'â¢â  "solid seven" % stood;
straight up once more. ;' >
A resolution carrying with it the follow
ing appointments to the places declared
vacant by the previous resolution was
adopted after more objections from Su
pervisors Clinton and Dodge had been
voted down. The former made a point in
favor of giving the women's petition a
show and the women a chance to try to
keep this City Hall clean. These are the
appointments that were made:

ments Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectivelyâ John A.

A resolution by Supervisor Clinton tbat

affecting the City and County of San
Francisco was adopted. Supervisor Rot
tanzi objected to the appointment, saying

necessary, but he could not go there
and stay a long time.
The board adjourned to 8 o'clock next
Monday evening.

MRS. CARLSON'S MORTGAGE.
Judge Slack Asked to Annul Security
for a Wife's Debt.
Judge Slack has granted a week's fur
ther time in the case of August Carlson
against J. J. Kauer.
From the complaint on file itappean
Carlson's wife borrowed $125 from Raver,
giving a chattel mortgage onithe house
hold furniture to secure repayment of thÂ«
debt. WÂ§&
When Raver threatened to take judg.
inent against Mrs. Carlson and to remove
the property in satisfaction of his bill, a
suit for permanent injunction was entered
by Carlson, who alleged that he never au
thorized his wife to montage the house
hold furniture or to borrow money for him
in any way. â¢ .
Carlson pleaded the statute which ex
empts such property Irom . execution and
j asks that Raver be restrained from remov
ing the property Irom his residence at 817
Bush street, ana demands that the chattel
mortgage be canceled.
. Testimony in regard, to the transaction,
will be heard next Wednesday, at which,
time Raver will try to prove that Carlson
was willing to share in the enjoyment of
tne f 125 borrowed by his wife, but that lie
objects to repaying the loan.

iiUIMMy WORKS.LINCOLNCAL.YESTERDAY WAS
THEIR CHRISTMAS
The Greek Church Folk
Celebrated at the
Cathedral.
A Bishop ani Two Priests
Conducted the Two Long
Services.
Fifty Persons, IncluJing the Russian
Consul, Dined by the Presiding
B;shop.
Yesterday, according to the calendar
recognized by the Greek Church, was the
anniversary of the birth of Christ. The
occasion was fittingly celebrated by the
members of the faith in this City.
In the forenoon there was an elaborate
service participated in by the Presiding
Di&hop and tlie two clergyman, all of
whom reside in the cathedral on Powell
street and Montgomery avenue, where the
ceremonies were performed. The morn
ing service alone occupied three hours.
It began at 10 o'clock. The ceremonies of
the evening lasted for two hours.
At the conclusion of the morning ser
vice in the chapel the Bishop entertained
at luncheon in another part of the build
ing some fifty persons, including the Rus
sian Consul, the clergy of the church, the
members of the choir, the altar boys and
other functionaries. It was an informal
Christmas luncheon with Christmas cheer,
fieated at the head ol the long table was
the bishop, typical in his full, bushy, curly
black beard and black hair. In a corner
of the double room stood a Christmas tree
sparkling with its little globes and tinsel
ornaments. From the chandeliers and
against the walls were draped small tri
colored Russian flags with their white,
blue and red widths running lengthwise
as opposed to the perpendicular arrange
nientof the three colors in the national
emblem of France.
Large portraits of the young Czar and
Czarina grouped with a portrait of the
late Czar were surrounded tÂ»y small flags,
for the Czar of all the Russia? is also the
official head of the Greek Church.
Few probably are familiar with the ap
pearance ol the interior of the local Greek
Church. The outside, except lor its
mosque-iike, almost spherical towers,
panned a brilliant skyblue, and sur
mounted by little pinnacles, presents the
appearance oi a large residence, and proo
ab.'y was so intended in the original
plans.
You enter the church proper by a ball
way, leading back irom the front door of
the buikling and connecting with the
main auditorium only by an ordinary
little doorway through which the congre
gation passes into the comparatively small
church. But that cburcu is a cathedral in
minature. The walls are literally covered
with sacred paintings and gilded altar
furnishings, and bright cloths illumined
by colored rays streaming down through
the stained-glass window at the aliar-end
of the room complete the characteristic
picture.
.For the Christmas celebration, which
began a week ago and will continue for
two weeks Jonger, the little narrow room
is further decorated and brichtened by
numerous wVeaths of pine and ivy twined
with clusters oi red holly berries. And all
about the waits and the few pillars are
draped festoons of green ivy, with here
and there a display of iarge biakes.
In the middle of the room is a very low
platform, surrounded by potted palms.
It is the throne of the Bishop, who at one
stage of fhe ceremony rises and extends
the blessing, at the same time crossing two
brazen candlesticks before him in solemn
pantomime. One candlestick has three
brunches and contains three Liiiall can
dles; the other has only two.
The altar platform i- almost on a level
with the main floor, above which it is
raised only a few inches. Back of it is a
Jow partition, back of whicn is the vestry.
This partition is radiant with a great
gilded sunburst midway and with paint
ings of Christ and the sainis in gilded
frames.
And all this church, with its choir of
fifteenâ some of them women â with its
vested altar-boys and its priests and its
Bishop, is crowded to its full capacity
with a little over a hundred persons in it.
But the hoarse-voiced bell toils on from
the dome overhead, and the faithful few
gather there to commemorate the anni
versary of the birth of Christ.
"COMMON SENSE."
Judge Carroll Cook Explains How Ho
Will te Influenced in Hil
Decisions.
Judge Carroll Cook yesterday made use
of an expression that is already under the
ban of the Supreme Court, for he Jet it be
known that he intends to be guided by
"common sense' 1 in deciding questions
presented for his consideration.
The case of Nicholas Brennan, charged
with criminal assault on Theresa Tarpey
and with placing her in a house of ill
repute against her will, was on hearing on
writ of habeas corpus.
Attorney Lonf.', representing the de
fendant, insisted that the court had a
right to order the discharge of the accused
bo far as the commitment for assault was
concerned, even though he should be held
on ihe other charge, and on the further
charge of extortion that was also pending,
but was not called in question by the writ.
Judge Cook said he could not entertain
the views of counsel under present circum
stances. He recognized that the charge
for assault has very little evidence to sus
tain it ana it is probable no conviction
can be secured, bnt there appears to bo a
valid commitment in another matter, so
Brennan cannot truly say tnat he is. ille
gally deprived of his liberty. The Court
added:
I know of no decision on this point of prac
tice which is reported, but so Jar as that is con
cerned I do not care particularly whether
there are decision? or not. I loon upon law as
the result of reason and common sense Of
course 1 know there is a great deal of space
taken up by the expression of views ol the
courts upon different matters and most ot the
space taken up by them is devoted to reciting
opinions of courts that preceded them rattier
than in giving their own conclusions. But
when a proposition is open to reason and rea
son shows it to be the proper rule it certainly
must be the legul rule.
It was ordered that bail be reduced in
the charge of coercion and Judge CooK
added that if bonds be filed in repard to
the other charges and a petition for a writ
of habeas corpus be presented on the
charge of assault, he would be willing to
hear further argument on that point.

NO SETTLEMENT
IS NOW LIKELY
Official Statement of the
Affairs of the Levin
Brothers.
Wide Discrepancy Between As
sets and Liabilities
Shewn.
The Contingent Interest of Mrs. Levin
in Seme Valuable Real
Estate Attached.
There is now every probability that the
fijm of Levin Bros., grocers, whose lailnre
was announced about ten days aco, will
be forced through insolvency, as the com
pleted statement of their Â«sset9 and lia
bilities shows a much wider discrepancy
than was generally supposed, even by
these who were Jeast favorably inclined
toward the embarrassed firm.
This statement was finished yesterday
and copies of it furnished to each member
of the committee appointed by the Board
of Trade. It will be formally iaid before
the committee as a whole this morning at
10 o'clock.
In round numbers the statement makes
the following showing:
Merchandise on hand In the five stores of
the firm 831,000
Fixtures on haud in the five stores of the *
firm â¢ 7000
Book accounts, supposed to be collectable 4,000
Book account", bad and doubiful 1-,OUU
Total assets Â»54,00U
Ix>cal Indebtedness, open accounts $80,000
Eastern indebtedness, open account* 7.0U0
Notes, partly secured 40.000
Total liabilities 8127,000
Ex cess of liabilities over assets ~973,W)b
One of the chief creditors in comment
ing on this statement called attention to
the fact that in the list of assets is in
ciuaed $12,000 worth of bad and doubtful
book accounts, and also $7000 worth of fix
tures. The first of these items, he re
marked, would probably not yield any
thing to speak of, while from the value of
the fixtures as given in the statement
should be deducted at least half of the
sum mentioned. This would leave the
net value of the assets less than $40,000.
From this must p.lso be deducted some
thing for the deterioration of the mer
chandise, which has been inventoried at
invoice price.
All the stores of the firm were cloÂ«eq on
Monday, and there is, therefore, no fur
ther revenue to be expected lrom the sale
of poods. On the other hand, a receiver
is now in charge of each store. The chief
of these is paid $10 a day, and his assist
ants each $5 a day. This makes an ex
pense cf $30 a day* and in addition rent
must be paid for the stores. These ex
penses, with other incidental ones, are
rapidly consuming the assets, and for this
reason it is believed the affairs of the firm
will be speedily wound up.
Among the creditors of the firm is the
Angio-Calilornian bank, to which some
thing over $30,000 is due. Part of this is
secured by a note indorsed by Mrs. Julius
Levin for $10,000. Mrs. Levin has a con
tingent interest in a valuable piece of
property on Sutter street, in connection
witu which there is a romantic story.
Some years aao the owner of this prop
erty, a Frenchman, desired to go to his
native land to pass the remainder of his
days there and did not want to be troubled
with the care of tne property. He there
fore agreed to deed the same to tne father
of Mrs. Levin on condition that he was
paid a certain stipulated sum every month,
this amount to be remitted to him regu
larly. The conditions were agreed to, and I
the deed to the property is now in e-crow,
to be delivered to the heirs of Mr.?. L vin's
father on the death of the grantor, who is
now an old man. Mrs. Levin's father has
since died.
Yesterday Mrs. Levin's interest in this
â¢property was attachecK by the Ar.glo-Cali
lornian Bank to secure the payment of the
$10,000 note which she indorsed for her
husband.
In view of the fact that such a poor
showing of assets is made, a number oi

LAND AND SEA TALES.
Harry Sabine, a Deserter l-'roin the
United States Army, Placed
Under Arrest.
Harry Sabine, a deserter from the United
States army, was arrested yesterday after
noon by Policeman Galloway and a few
hours later was taken to the Presidio.
Sabine was in a saloon on Howard
street, between Fifth and Sixth,
amusing people by going through the
bayonet exercise with a gun borrowed for
j the occasion. Galloway watched him for
some minutes and began to ask him
questions till finally Sabine admitted he
was a deserter from the army and was
anxious to be arrested and be done with it.
He said be deserted from Jefferson bar
racks, St. Louis, Mo., in 18yl. He told a
story of his adventures since then that
would class him ahead of Jules Verne for
vivid imagination. He had served in the
English army and then went out to Aus-
I tralia, where he owned a cattle ranch con
| taining over 1300 head of cattle. He
joined a " blackbirding " expedition to
the South Seas, was arrested and bent to
prison, finally escaping. He had twice
traveled round the world, starting each
time without a cent in his pocket, and
| had thrilling adventures in various lands.
| His age is only 27, but his experiences
would make him five times that age.

"THE GREATER REPUBLIC"
Nicaragua, Honduras and Salva
dor Have Formed a
Federation.
Dr. Calderon Has Baen Appointed
Consul-General ia This City
for the Union.
The "Republica Mayor de Centro Amer
ica," or Greater Republic of Central
America, is now a fact on the map of the
Western Hemisphere, and Salvador, Nica
ragua and Honduras are united in a feder
ation. By this change the consulates in
this City of the three countries are merged
in one, and the commissions of Captain
William L. Merry, Consul-General of Nica
ragua ana J. T. Wright for Honduras, are
canceled, and Dr. Estorjio Calderon for
Salvador was appointed Consul-General
for the Greater Republic of Central Amer
ica by Jose Dolores Rodriguez, the repre
sentative of the federation at Washington.
The united republics wi.ll bo governed
I by a Diet of three members, one from cacti
country. This body possesses the execu
tive power of the federation, and is
elected by the vote of the Legislature of
the countries, to hold office for three
years. The presidents of the three States
j correspond to the governors of the United
| States. A proposition has been submitted
I to the two remaining Central American
| States, Costa Rica and Guatemala, invit
ing them to join the union. If they con
pent the federation will then be called the
Republic of Central America.
The Greater Republic of Central America
will .now be in a position to dominate
affairs in that pan of the continent. This
has been the ii ream of the most enlight
ened statesmen of Central America for
years, and in this new oider oi things it is
believed thnt the three countries will ad
vance rapidly in political and commercial
importance. United they can defend
themselves aeainst a foreign or domestic
foe and crush lawlessness in the shape of
revolutions at the first outbreak. As the
Central American States purchase 90 per
cent of their imports in San Francisco any
advancement of these countries toward
prosperity cannot but be hailed with de
licht by the people of the Pacific slope.

LACK OF COAL
CLOSES A SCHOOL
The Pupils of the Agassiz
PnHfc.ry Suffer From
Cold.
Chairman Bautel of the Supplies
Committee Begins an
Investigation.
Contractors Must Not Wait for Ships
to Bring the Necessary
Fuel.
The schools under the control of the
Board of Education have been threatened
with a coal famine during the past few
days, and one school was closed for a day
because the pupils were not able to pursue
their studies ia the lireless rooms.
On Tuesday morning Miss Sarah J.
Jones, principal of the Agassiz Primary
School on Bartlett street, between Twenty
second and Twenty-third, telephoned to
the secretary of the board that her pupils
were not able to work in the classrooms
without fires, and asked for instructions.
"I don't see any remedy except to send
them home," answered the secretary, and
Miss Jones accordingly announced that
studies were suspended for the day.
The matter came to the ears of Chair
man Charles A. Bautel of the Committee
on Supplies yesterday, and he promptly
instituted an investigation. He found
that the Aeassiz School was not the only
one suffering, but that the principals of
the P eabody and other schools had lodged
complaints with the board, and that a
dearth of fuel was evident everywhere.
He at once gave instructions that the
necessary supplies be furnished.
"It is a shame that scholar* ara kept
from their studies by a lack of coal to keep
them warm," he said, "and I shall not
allcw such a thing to happen again.
"The contractor who is under contraeft
to furnish fuel gives the excuse that he
could not get the coal demanded by his
agreement because the ship on which he
expected it has not yet entered port. This
appears to be a poor excuse. If he could
not pet the iuel In that way he should
have procurpil it :rom other dealers. In
the future when coal is short it will be
ordered from the nearest dealer and the
amount paid for it charged to the con
tractor.
"No school under the control of this
department will be allowed to close for
the want pi the fuel to keep the pupils
warm."
DENIES THE OHAEGES.
Secretary Welch Says That Sister Julia's
Allegations Are >'ot Correct.
All is not peace in the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Chil
dren. Sister Julia has brought charges
against Charles P. Welch, the secretary
of the society. Secretary Welch says that
the charges are untrue, and that the mat
ters with which they deal concern only
himself and his family personally, and
hints that Sister Julia has made the
charges because he refused to allow her
moneys of the society when she asked for
them. At least one officer of the society
sides with him, taking ttie view that Sister
Julia wants to run the society.
The substance of the charges is that
Secretary Welch, going to 506b Turk street,
made an unauthorized entrance into the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Connell, where he
supposed his stepson to be, and that while
there be used language unbecoming a
gentleman. In reply, Secretary Welch
says that he spoke bis mind freely, think
ing he had cause so to do, ana that he was
very angry, bnt he denies that he was
violent, or that be broke into drawers or
injured anything about the place.
The directors of the society have not
investigated the matter officially. A
meeting was to have been held Tuesday,
but a quorum was not present.

A Guatemalan, a Pure-Food and
a Fiber-Culture Bill
Considered.
Under Certain Conditions the Proposed
Pilotage Bill May Be Cham
pioned.
The Council of Associated Industries of
California held an important meeting in
the rooms of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association yesterday afternoon.
The principal business coming before the
body was the consideration of proposed
Dills to the present Legislature.
President Sonntag stated briefly the
questions to come under consideration
and named the following committees:
Executfve committeeâ J. S. Emery, David
Rich, B. N. Rowley. Legislative committeeâ
J. A. Filclier, Isldor Jacobs, James W. Kerr.
Committee on municipalities â Charles Bund
schu, George R. Fletcner, D. M. Carman. Com
mittee on National legislationâ M. J. Keller,
L. F. Lastreto, P. J. Uealy.
Isidor Jacobs, representing the San
Francisco Fruit Exchange, wanted the
council to take action on the pilotage bill
proposed by the Committee on Commerce.
He said $2500 had been raised by that
organization lor the purpose of urging the
adoption of the bill, wuich would tend
greatly to increase the commerce of this
port. But as the pilots would undoubt
edly make a strong fi^ht against the
measure he thought it should receive the
united support of all organizations work
ing for the good of the City. Action was
deferred till the next meeting, in order to
efford the committee on commerce *a
caance to join the council. It decided
not to take up measures proposed by ex
traneous organizations lor obvious rea-
The committee on the bill with regard
to fiber culture proposed by the State De
velopment Committee, composed of
Messrs. Adams, Carman and Denicke, re
ported a substitute for the bill, to De con
sidered by the council. It did not believe
that a special commission should be ap
pointed, but that the work should be
entrusted to an agency now maintained
by the State, and recommended that the
University of California take the matter
in charge. The bill was adopted as
changed by the committee.
Charles Bundschu, chairman of the
committee on the Central American Ex
hibition, reported in favor of the bill sub
mitted at the last meeting. Colonel
Denicke thought a State appropriation of
$5000 wouid be sufficient, but the bill as
read, a-kingforan appropriation of $10,000
to make a suitable exhibit of the resources
of California, was adopted by tbe council.
Dr. Williamson was added to the Pure
Food Committee. He said the Board of
Health had several bills low in the hands
of an attorney, which it hoped the coun
cil would indorse. Furthermore he stated
that the health authorities of this City
and the bay cities would bold a confer
ence in the near future, at which it was
advisable fcr the council to have repre
sentatives. Messrs. Jacobs and Kerr were
appointed as delegates.
The Golden Gate Carnival Committee
made a written request that its work thus
far be indorsed by the council. The mat
ter was referred to the Committee on Mu
nicipalities.
A proposed bill was presented by the
State Board of Horticulture establishing a
free market on the water front. It was
placed in the hands of a committee com
posed of Messrs. Filcner, Adams, Jacobs
and Kyle.
Messrs. Adams and Kendrick were ap
pointed a committee to investigate the
leasibllity of referring the prosecutions of
vitiations of the pure-food laws to an ex
isting board or board's. It has been hard
heretofore to punish such infractions.
Consideration of a proposed bill of the
State Board of Trade asking for an appro
priation of $70,000 to enable California to
make a suitable exhibition of her products
at the Omaha exposition, to be held in
1898, was laid over for ten days.
During the progress of the meeting an
extensive discussion arose as to the powers
of the legislative committee in connection
with bringing the bills proposed by the
various associations before the Legisla
ture. Some of the members labored under
the misapprehension that each bill was to
be fathered by only the organization to
which it owed its origin after securing the
indorsement of the Council of Associated
Industries.
The matter was finally disposed of by
the decisive action of President Sonntag,
who ruled that the legislative committee
of the council should act co-operatively
witn all the other bodies. He believed
that the small progress made in the past
by individual organizations for public im
provements and reforms was due wholly
to a lack of co-operation with other asso
ciations.
All the- proposed bills indorsed by the
council will be token to Sacramento and
presented to the Legislature at the earliest
possible moment. Isidor Jacob 3 left yes- (
terday at 6 p. m. for the State Capitol to
take the preliminary steps necessnry for
doing so. He will introduce the Guate
malan bill. A competent attorney may
be engaged to go before the Legislature
and assist the commission in its work.
Toe cost of securing t- c services of such
a one whs estimated at $750. One-fifth of
this amount has already been subscribed
and all present were confident that a much
larger sum could be raised.
The council adjourned until next Mon
day at 3 p. m.
MR. REMBOLD WINS.
Judge Slack Dismisses the Contempt
Proceedings Without Comment.
Attorney Rembold gained a victory over
his opponents in the Sarah M. Parsons es
tate litigation yesterday.
When called on to produce Mrs. Parsons'
will or show cause why he should not be
punished for not doing so Mr. Rem bold re
plied that he had sent the will to Georgia,
as he thought that was the proper place
for it since the testator's estate was
mainly located there.
Judge Slack accepted this explanation
as satisfactory and dismissed the con
tempt proceedings without comment. He
also denied the application of Dr. Phillip
H. Maas for letters testamentary with will
annexed, but granted special levers of
administration to Dr. Maas with* bonds
rixr d at $200.
Considerable comment was indulged in
by Mr. RÂ«Â»mbold and his lawyer in regard
to infractions of proiesdional courtesy and
ethics by attorneys who get their suits in
the newspapers bei'ura they are in the
courts, and the incident closed without
further comment.

.NEW YORK. N.Y., Jan. 6.â Speculation at the
stock exchange durin; the first hour of business
was characterized by a firm tone, owing mainly to
advices from Washington that the Cameron reso
lution on the Cuban question would be burled in
the committee. This news resulted in further
purchases to cover short contracts as well as for
the long account, but there was little interest to
Indicate any marked revival of outside interest in
speculation. . The general list improved 14 to 13/ s
per cent, the latter in Chicago Gas, which was
bought by brokers usually Id entitled with the in
siders. Among the sreclaltiei Consolidated Gas
jumped 31 15 10 146%, and Delaware and Hudson
1% to 121%, the latter on rumors that the usual
dividend 01 v per cent would be declared for the
current year by the directors at their meeting
to-day.
After midday the demand for stocks generally
fell off and the market relapsed into a dull state.

courage and hammered the leading shares with

from 145% to 144 on the introduction of meas
ures at Aluaiiy for a reduction in the price of gas
to $1 or under per 1000 feet. When it became
definitely known that the directors of the Dela
ware and Hudson Canal Company had decided to
pay only 5 per cent for the current year, that
stock broke rapidly BVi points 10 113%, closing
at the lowest figures.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111-. Jan. 6.â The early trading In
wheat to-day bare no Imprint of significance.
Scalping operations were mainly responsible for
keeping the trade alive. The crowd was inclined
to look for some buying of consequence at the
opening, inasmuch as Liverpool cables failed to
reflect our weakness of yesterday, but In this they
were mlstacen, and when a littl* wheat was
offered prices slipped away with celerity. First
quotations were from i/gc Io Vie over the final
ones of yesterday, but the gain was quickly lost
and yet loner prices were established. Later
; there was some covering, a rally resulting there
from. Receipts at Chicago were 37 cars and 115,
--205 bushels were taken from store. The North
west had 120 cars, against 225 last Wednesday
and 402 a year ago.
A sharp break took place at noon, several large
lines of long wheat being sold out. Export clear
ances were light at 222.452 bushels. Closing
Continental cables were irregular. The market
was in a state of panic during the last n our. gen

Gave No Credit to Noah.
Amos Cuniminjrs bad a sort of political
godfather, an Irishman, who used to exer
cise a watchful care over. the. doings of
the Tammany Congressman. When Cum
minjrs was chairman of the Naval Commit
tee, he made a great speech in the House
on the subject of the marine architecture
from the earliest times down to the
present. hen he went over to New York,
after the speech, his old friend met him
and took him to task.
"What Is it you don't like about that
speech?" asked Cummiags.
"Now, Amos, me boy, it was a grand
spache, full ay fine wurruds and figgers
galore, but yez missed wan important in
stance that Oi shud have tho't yez wud
have renumbered. Noah â he built the ark,
Amos, and yez gave him no credit at all."
Cummings has said he doesn't know yet
whether the old man was poking fun at
his speech or whether he was in dead
earnest about the important historical ref
erence that he had omitted. â Washington

He Did Not Arrange
a Suicide.
His Mind a Blank Since He
Left His Disk 4,ast
Monday Night.
Found Himself at Vallejo, and With
His Pastor Rfpined His
Family.
Oakland Office San Fsxscaco Call,!
908 Broadway. Jan. o. i
As stated in this rooming'" Call, W. G.
Stuart, auditor of Weils- Fargo, am not
commit suicide. At an eariy hour this
morning he returned to his East Oakland
home a physical wreck.
At 11 o'clock last night a man called at
the house ol Rev. S. S. Palmer, who lives
in East Oakland. The minister put his
head out of the window to inquire what
was wanted. The man told him he was
the missing Mr. Stuart, and that he would
like the pastor to accompany him to his
wite for the purpose of smoothing matters
cut.
Mr. Palmer did not recognize Stuart.
He had shaved off his mustache and side
whiskers, and wore an old suit such as is
worn by express messengers of the com
pany by whom he was employed. The
clergyman entered into conversation with
his visitor, and soon became convinced
that his mind was unbalanced.
"I can remember nothing," said Stuart,
"from the time I .'eit the office nntil I
fonnd nayseif in Vallejo. I do not know
boÂ» I got there or what I did before go
ing."
fctuart and the minister went at once to
the home where the sorrowful wife was
nursing Her sick children. Mr. Palmer
went in first, broke the news to her and
as soon as he introduced the husband he
was greeted with an affectionate embrace.
In response to a question from hi j wife,
t-tuat repeated that he knew nothing of
what he had been doing, denied any recol
lection of having planned asuicideand said
the only thing be knew was mat he had
not eaten anything since he left his desk.
X. c man's looks certainly corroborated
his words. He is completely wrecked
mentally and physically and expressed
genuine surprise when told of his coat and
hat and farewell note iound on the ferry
boat.
Mrs. Stuart was seen at her home to
day and cheerfully imparted the informa
tion that her husband cad returned.
'"Yes, Mr. Stuart is at home," she said.
"He came here with Rev. Mr. Palmer a
little after m dnight. We are both mem
bers of the Presbyterian church and that
is why he went to the minister. He is
now very sick and confined to oed, ami a
physician is attending him. It is easy for
me, however, now thai I have seen him,
to explain his actions. 1 have no doubt
that loss of .-Jeep and steady work ren
dered him temporarily insane. For the
vast two weeks our children huve been
very sick with measles and he has heiped
me to attenu them during the night. For
a who'.e week before his leaving he aid not
take off Lis clothes, but all this time he
KtteniSed regularly to his tedious work at
"Wells-Fargo's."
Manager Bonneil will give Stuart back
his position. He has assured the wife
that he ha 3 every confidence in her hus
band and that he will hold his place open
for him for two weeks or until it was
proved that he had committed suicide.
Much injury has beer, done Mr. Stuart by
a published statement that he is inclined
to drink liquor freely. This is not true
and is forcioly denied by his employers
and his wife.

EZETA'S HOPE IS GONE
The Fallen President Looks
Upon the Greater Republic
as a Farce.
Says It Is a Scheme for the Purpose
of Being Able to Obtain
Large Lo9n>
Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call.)
908 .Broadway, Jan. 6. j
General Ezeta, the exiled President of
the Republic of Salvador, had one more
bitter dreg added to his cup of unhappi
ness this morning. He read the published
report of the cancellation of the papers of
the Consuls-General of the republics of
Honduras Salvador and Nicaragua and
the issuance of papers to his sworn enemy,
Dr. Calderon, as Consul-General of the
three united republics.
These facts mean that Ezeta's last hope
of returning to Salvador and being re
ceived by his faiihful people will never be
realized.
"I look upon the whole matter," said
the general, as he pneed uneasily up and
down his room in the Galindo Hotel, "aÂ«
a great farce. The unification of those
three republics has all been accomplished
by their respective Governments without
ever submitting the question to the peo
ple, There is a motive for it â a very clever
motive â and before long the money-lend
ers of this country and Europe will dis
cover it. These three bankrupt republics
have simply banded together for mutual
strength, and for the purpose of present
ing to the world an appearance of solidity
and stability bo that they will be enabled
to float some heavy loans under the guise
of making permanent improvements and
developing the Greater Republic of Cen
tral America.
"Any one as familiar as I am with that
territory must admit that my statement
is correct. The same terms upon v.hich
those thive republics united were offered
to Guatemala and Costa Rica and were
refused. Those two republics are well
governed and elect their .officials in the
same manner as the United States. They
are financially sound and progressive, and
knew far more than to make an alliance
with sta eg hopelessly bankrupt and with
out credit abroad.
"The Greater Republic will exist only
until such time as iin international com
plication arises. The citizens have not
passed upon this question of federation,
and they do not care so long as they are
not affected individually. They have be
come used to a state of chronic revolution,
but when they find themselves involved
with some foreign nation down will go
this triple Government, and with the Gov
ernment will disappear the loans that the
present federation may have made it
possible to borrow."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 7, 1897.
SUNDAY CLOSING
AND VOTE-MAKING
Mr. Bassett Says There Is
No Risk in the Latest
Scheme.
Mr. Manuel Will Let the Matter
Be Decided by the
People.
The Periodicel Tern Taken at the
Wbe.l to Promote Morals in
Oakland.
Oakland Office San Fbaxcisco Call,)
IK)8 Broadway, Jan. 6. f
As usual, the Sunday-closing movement
is acain brought prominently forward at
the beginning of (he municipal campaign.
The two invariably visit the city together
every two years.
Some very neat political work.is woven
around the present attempt to navigate
over the Sunday-closing reef without
striking it and without having it appear
that it was sailed around.
The last time it was brought up was in
the form of an ordinance making it com
pulsory to close saloons from Saturday
evening till Monday morning. Prior to
the last election a majority of votes in the
Council were promised for the measure,
but after election two of the pledgees fell
down. They were Councilmen Manuel
and Mott. On this occasion Mr. Manuel
is again the author of a.Sunday-closing
resolution which is comparatively safe.
He wants an ordinance drafted calling a
municipal election at which the saloon
question shall be submitted to the people.
I This measure will be passed by the Coun
â  cil and vetoed by the Mayor, aud there
! not being enough votes to pass it over his
veto Mr. Manuel takes no chance in intro
j ducing it.
J. M. Bassett, the Councilman-at-large,
j makea no pretense of favoring Sunday
closing, and declares that he and Mr.
Manuel are in harmony on the matter in
reality, although apparently they are op
posed. "Mr. Manuel and his friends
tackled this same question two years ago,",
said Mr. Bassett, "but they found it was
too heavy for them to carry, so they
looked for an excuse to back out. At that
time the Rev. Mr. Rader was identified
with a Sunday closing league, and of
course being an energetic little man, he
advocated his case warmly. Something
which he said was very easily twisted by
Mr. Manuel and his friends into an 'in
sult' and they made this an excuse for
breaking their promise. At this time and
in the manner proposed, it is a very -afe
campaign cry. If Mr. Manuel and Mr.
Mott really want to close the saloons on
Sunday, let them draft an ordinance mak
ing it mandatory and I will vote for
it, but this two-faced manner of getting
around the question so as to save the
church vote is too apparent to deceive
anybody.
"There is a principle in this matter.
There are about four hundred men in this
city who pay $100 a qaarter for the privilege
of . selling liquor. It is unfortunate, but
nevertheless true, that Saturday night
and Sun tay it the time they do the most
| trade. Now, I believe that if they are pro
hibited from selling during that time a cer
tain proportion of their license should be
returned. But the ordinance makes no
such provision."
Mr. Manuel, who succeeded in having
his resolution placing the matter before
the people passed by the Council, says
that he is guided by the large petition
presented to tne Council that such action
be taken. He disclaims any selfish or
political motive and asserts that he is
acting in accordance with the express
wishes of a large number of voters.

WATCHING FOR
THE SWANHILDA
She Carries a Fourteen-
Fold Murderer as
a Passenger.
An Arch-Fiend That Killed and
Took the Names oi His
Victims.
He Escaped in a Sailing Vessel, but
Detectives Followed in a
Steamer.
"When the British ship Swanhilda gets
near or into this port from Newcastle,
N. S. W., she will be boarded by a c'.oud of
detectives who will asK for Frank Butier,
alias Frank Herwood, alias S. Burgess, alias
Lee Weller, alias Simpson, alias Claire and
many other names conveniently taken on
daring a career of blood. A3 he is be
lieved to have assumed at different times
the names of his victims they may be
traced by his aliases.
If this man does not transfer his very
valuable and much-wanted body to some
other vessel en route or otherwise elude
the officers they will get a prize indeed, for
he is a murderer fourteen times over.
This is the reason why two detectives
from Sydney are now on their way to this
City, and another from London is coming
to take up their watch for the four-master
Swanhilda.
This colonial butcher was well known in
Australia even before the police began to
trace his awful crimes to his door. The
particular crimes for which he is now be
ing hunted is the murder of Captain Wel
l^r, a master mariner, and a man named
Preston. The two men came 10 him. a-; it
is believed many other victims had done
before, in answer to an advertisement ask
ing for partners to engage in mining near
a place called Linden. One of the condi
tions was that each applicant must have
at least Â£10 ana come well recommended.
Butler and his two partners departed for
the alleged mine about the middle of No
vember, and only he was after seen alive.
Their bodies were found in a wild part of
the mountains, both having been mur
dered and undoubtedly robbed.
The detectives traced Butler to New
ccstle and learned that he had gone
aboard the Swanhilda, which had sailed
for San Francisco November 27, either as
a passenger or a guest of Captain Fraser
or as a man before the mast. He is now
under the name of Lee Weller.
Then came the ocean race. Detective
M. A. Conroy and Constable McUattie of
Sydney, N. S. W., took passage aboard of
the steamship Miowera. which sailed for
Victoria before ilie Monowai left for San
Francisco. The officers landed in Vic
toria last Monday evening and will soon
be in this City to await the coming of the
Swanbilda and their quarry.
Since the escape of Bntler from Aus
tralia the police officials believe that he
murderea twelve other persons in New
South Wales during the last year. He is
supposed to have decoyed them under one
pretext or another by means of newspa
per advertisements into places convenient
lor his black purpose and taken their
lives.
Of course there is a possibility that But
ler is not on board of the Swanbilda, but
is still at large in the great southeastern
continent. The only evidence that he
took passaee on the vessel is the state
ment of boatmen in Newcastle, who when
shown a photograph of the murderer de
clared that they had put that man aboard
of the Swanbilda just before she sailed.
And again there la also a possibility that
he may have succeeded in leaving the ship
at some island or getting transhipped to
some other vessel in midocean. The fel
low is shrewd enough to know that all
Australia is ringing with the accounts of
his crimes and that the electric cable has
Bpread the news over the world.
Detective Conroy has a double interest in
capturing the red-handed murderer, as be
came near answering one of Butler's
deadly advertisements. The two men
were to have gone prospecting together,
but Conroy secured a position on the de
tective lorce and changed his plans. He
will readily identify Butler through any
disguise and will be prepared to arrest his
man at all hazard.
One of ihe murderer's aliases is
"Frank Harwood." This is the name of
a young mm he undoubtedly killed at I
Coolgardie Plains two years ago. Butler
assumed the name and property of How
ard, and bore that title till he found an
other victim, and incidentally another
name.
British Vice-Consul Moore stated yes
terday that the date of the Swanhilda's
arrival could not be set, but probably she
would not get into port till the latter part j
of this month, or possibly about the 24th.
The consular office had been advised in
November of the crimes of Butler and bil
escape in the Swanhilda, bound for San
Francisco. Mr. Moore also stated that the ,
necessary extradition papers would be !
rea !y, and that the colonial officers, as- I
sisted by the local detective force, would
promptly arrest the murderer upon the
arrival of the big bark off this port.

NEW lODAT,
Real coffee is injurious â^you
know that. Makes you bilious,
dyspeptic, sleepless.
Ask your grocer for a package
of Old Grist Mill Wheat Coffee.
Try it and see how much better
you feel.
You'll like the flavor, too.

TURNED DOWN
FEW FAVORITES
Ladies* Day Was Not So
Prolific of Winning
Choices.
Racina, Governor Budd, Grey
hurst and Santa Bella
Were All Beaten.
Libertins Placed the Handicap to His
Creditâ T. Murphy Piloted Hello to
Victory in tbe Hurdie Race.
It was "ladies' day" again at Ingieside
track yesterday and the beautiful weather
drew a large attendance. The cars \on
veyine people home at the conclusion of
the races looked like popcorn balls cov
ered with flies, and just a few additional
cars next time would be a great con
venience. As the meeting progresses the
favorites appear to be on the wane, for but
tv:o showed to the best advantage. Two
or three timid pencilers did not weigh in
yesterday and later cad cause for repent
hnce.
H. Hunn's entry The Sinner was the
first to bowl over a warm choice. Racina
was an even money favorite for the open
ing five-iurlong dash for maiden three
year-olds, but succumbed very easily to
The Snner,. who started at odds of 3 to
1. Modestia was a good third.
A six-furlong spin proved a very easy
thing for E. Corrigan's Moylan, the even
money favorite ior the next numbsr on
the programme. The hooded horse passed
Toano when sauared away for the final
run and never had to be extended, win
ning without effort from the old sprinter.
The rider of Yemen, who finite l sec
ond, claimed that his mount was fouled
by Toano in the stretch and the latter
sprinter was disqualified, which ruling
gave third place to the 100 to 1 shot Coda.
Even money and 11 to 10 were the odds
laid against Liberiine capturing the mi le
and a sixteenth handicap. The bay was
again up on k<e:i eJge and taking: up the
running down the back stretch led his
fieid to the wire, finally finishing three j
fourths of a length in front of Installator. |
Lobengiiia, rather injudiciously ridden by j
Jones, received show honors.
By clever piloting, T. Murphy got Hello
across ihc line first in the hurdle rac?,
beaiing a very moderate lot of company.
Governor Budd was a 3 to 2 favorite, with
several hot tins out on Malo Diablo, Can
dor and Mr. Reel. Ai post time a stiff
piay forced the price acainat Hello from 6
to 3. Mnlo Diablo started to make tbe
running, but quit earlier than his friends
expected.
Candor hit the stretch first looking all
pver a winner. About this time Murphy,
on HelJo, began making his piay, and
wnen the last jump was reached that
jumper was in front. From that on he held
the fiela safe and downed the outsider, j
Mr. Reel, very cleverly. The favorite !
linaliy took third place.
Frank X., of the magnificent cripple di
vision, ridden by Willie Martin, handled
his field to pood advantage in the fifth
event over a mile. Greyhurst was a hot'
fi to 5 favorite for the rus, with Rey del
Tierra a pronounced second choice.
The cray favorite was out in front of the
field until nearing the bend ior the stand,
when Frank K. scrambled into the iead
and, without much lett in reserve, downed
the stretch-running Morte Fonso nearly a
length. Greyhurst took third place from
Rev del Tierra in a drive.
Willie Martin, with his many kinks and
curves, led to the defeat of Santa Bella in
the final six furlong run. The mare was
a6toschance, out ridden in a most rus- |
picious manner from start to finish just I
managed to take the show. Sport MeAl- I
lister was always in the lead and wou rid- I
den out from Arapahoe.

Cioodraru Won eaiily. Winner, J. H. Tarn's cb. b., by imp. Friar Tuck-TwiligbL Time, 1:15 y t '
number of books posting odds yesterday.
The Rosedale Club, Joe Ullman. Harry
Harris and Ei Perles retired. Mr. Uil-
I man stated that he has been ill for some
! days and will take a rest.
The Ingieside officials have decided to
in future reject the entries of Toano and
Waiter J. It is their opinion that the
pair have a tendency to teach other horses
bad pranks.
One of the features of Saturday's card
will be a match race. Pat Murphy and
I Yemen were matched yesterday to run
j rive farlones, each to carry 100pounds>, for
1 $iGOO a side, the avocation to add $500
additional. George Berry supplied the
Alurp'iy end of the coin.
H. H. Hunn. former trainer of Walter
j Hobarts horses and lessee of The Sinner,
I to-eiher with his jockey, Pryr.e, were yes
i t era ay !>us;>ei.dert on account :>f the re
j ma'kable improvement shown in that
j norse's running. The officials intimated
that it might possibly be proven that
Pryce did not try very "hard for the coin
labt time out.
Greyhursi. entered in the fifth race to
be sold for $600, was claimed by Tom Grif â¢
tin, the " Hawkshaw " of the selling event
affairs. Trainer Ab Steniler was quite
' wrotby, but under the conditions Griffin,
who ran ~econrl to Frank X in the race,
put up $925 and added tue gray colt to bis
I string.
The Cambridge stable also narrowly
escaped losing Rey del Tierra. A. Nick
ells, owner of Veragua, put in a claim for
tbe colt, but was just one minute late.
It is just beginning to dawn on Califor
nia race-^oers why the far Eastern turf
officials consider the complex methods
employed by Willie Martin in piloting
horses so indecipherable, and informed
him in future to stay at home and spring
them on the wild, woolly and uncanny
j Westerner. He has furni-hed two or three
' very elegant pieces of tatooed work of
late, not failing to include that highly
embellished exhibition of borsemanship
nstride Santa Bella yesterday. When Mr.
Martin bets tbe public should bet, but
when Mr. Martin does not bet tbe public
had better not. This little item is not in
tended for an exhibi.ion of losing paste
boards; they are to be found in |proiusion
in tbe betting rine.
D. M. iJoyd, who arose in his wrath
and was very indignant because the press
mentioned his name in connection with
the Hayruarket scandal on January 2, was
yesterday indefinitely suspended by the
stewards at Ingieside track for having on
various occasions intimated to Jockey
j Stanford that the horse could be "laid up"
to advantage. As Haymarket was only
leased by Boyd the horse's entry will here
after be refused until such time as it is
proved that horseman has no further con
nection with the jumper. For failing to
report these suggestions to the stand
Jockey Stanford was fined $25 and sus
pended for the balance of th* meeting.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 7, 1897.
ANNIE PICKETT ARRESTED
She and Another Woman Cap
w tured in Sacramento for
Robbery.
The Pickett Woman Is Considered
tbe Cleverest Pickpocket in
tha City.
Annie Pickett, a notorious pickpocket,
was arrested yesrerJay in Sacramento,
and Policeman Al Wright left in the
afternoon to bring her back to the City.
Another woman was with her, and she
was also placed under arrest. She is sup
posed to be Mamie Bonner, another noto
rious pickpocket.
These two women are wanted here on a
charge of grand larceny, the complaining
witness being George Hill, 963 Eighth
street, Oakland.
Hill came to the City a few weeks ago
from the East with his wife, for tbe bene
fit of her health. They were boarding at
927 Geary street on December?. That day
Hill, while walking along O'Farrell street,
met the two women. They accosted him
and finally induced him to enter a saloon
with them. They went into a rear room
and there Hill was relieved of $400.
On discovering his loss he went to po
lice headquarters and reported it. He
was advised to swear to warrants for the
arrest of the two women, but he declined,
as be did not wiÂ«h his wife to know of
his experience. He wanted the police to
compel the women to return the money
and say no more about it, but they refused
to move in tbe matter unless Hill would
agree to prosecute them.
Hill placed his case in the bands of
private detectives. They rounded up the
women and got them to consent to return
the money last Friday. They failed to
keen their appointment and quietly left
the City. Next morning Hill swore to the
warrants for their arrest and a description
of them was sent broadcast from police
headquarters.
Both women have been arrested many
times on charges of grand larceny, but
they always succeeded in being acquitted,
as they were too clever at the business to
leave a loophole for the police to secure
direct evidence against them.
They have also been arrested several
times for vagrancy, but by some means
only known to the initiated they were
never convicted. There is a charge of va
grancy now pending against the Pickett
woman in one of the Superior courts', and
if the present charge of grand larceny
should fail it will be pressed against her.
The Pickett woman is one of the clever
est pickpockets known to the police. She
has an innocent-iooking face, which she
uses to advantage in entrapping her
numerous victims.

13AWAKE AFTER A
WINTER'S SLEEP
Cycle Board of Trade's First
Meeting of the New
Year.
Good Roads, Park Lights and the
Baggage Bill Will Be
Discussed.
A Bicycle Show Next Marchâ The
Question of Helping the B us
Ribbon Mset.
Last fall the Cycle Board of Trade went
into its winter sleep. It rubbed its eyes
to-day ana to-morrow will jump out of
bed and tackle the coming season with its
needs for wheelmen refreshed and rein
vigorated. "You must understand that
our catalepsy is only temporary," said
President J. S. Con well yesterday. "To
morrow night we awake and have what I
hope wiil be a vigorous meeting to take
up matters of interest for the new year."
The meeting will be held this evening
at Varney'a cyclorama. Several impor
tant matters will come before it. One of
these is the discussion of the question of
helping out the coming blue-ribbon meet.
This meet will be held at the Velodrome
January 16, when the racing will be for
ribbons instead of trophies of consider
able intrinsic value. The object of the
meet is to raise money to defray the ex
penses of the local delegates to the League
of American W heelmen convention, which
will be held in Albany, N. V., next month.
It is said that there is very little doubt
that the board will vote to give all the as
sistance it can.
Another subject to be considered is the
question of holding a bicycle show in San
Francisco, probably some time in March.
Such shows are devoted to exhibiting the
latest models in wheels, and the one next
March will place before the visitors the i
latest and best '97 wheels.
Some interesting novelties have been
introduced in various makes for 1897. An
endeavor will be made to make the '97
bicycle show the most attractive ever held
here. In Chicago such shows are an an
nual event of much importance, and are
visited by thousands of people.
Much effective work is going to be done
this year by the Cycle Board ol Trade und
the local clubs to get the park lighted. A
more vigorous campaign than ever will be
waged. "We are going to have the park
lighted this year or die," said a wheelman
yesterday. The meeting to-nijjht will also
discuss this subject,
Charles Freeman Johnson of this City
will address the meeting on the subject of
good roads. Mr. Johnson has been ap
pointed a special agent of inquiry in the
matier of good ronds by General Roy
Stone, chief of the United States Depart
ment 01 Highways. His work will be to
promote the national good-roads move
ment in California. He has just returned
from the East, and his inside pocket is
bulging with letters from prominent rail
road men. Congressmen, bicycle manu
facturers and others supponine the botter
roads movement. He also has letters
from prominent members of the League
of Amsrican "Wheelmen, which indicates
that tae league is noi opposed to the
good-roads organization. A resolution
will be introduced at the meeting in
dorsing Mr. Johnson and the good-roads
movement. Special Agent Johnson will
establish a weekly or monthly publication
here, to be called Highways.
The board has not lost interest in the
Armstrong baggage bill during its winter
somnolency. Nearly every man elected
to the present Legislature is pledged to
the bill, aud on this account the board
has dreamed peacefully instead of being
disturbed by nightmare. However, the
wheelmen will not take it easy in regard
to that bill until it is passed and the rail
roads are by law compelled to carry their
wheels free of change as baggage. "There
is a man at Sacramento now who has ac
cepted the special charge of the bill, but
the meeting to-night will in all proba
bility discuss the advisability of sending
a proper lobby to the Capitol at the proper
time, as the Southern Pacific lobby ia
always there and never asleep.
A THREE-MONTH PROGRAMME.
Series of Entertainments for Trophies
Arranged by the Olympic Club.
The directors of the Olympic Club met
last night and arranged the programme of
entertainments lor the next three months.
On January 28 there is to be a wrestling
tournament for the Pacific Coast cham
pionship, open events, at 125, 135, 145 and
158 pounds respectively, and also for
heavy-weights, for trophies. The chal
lenge of Herbert Greenland of the Mult
nomah Athletic Club of Portland, to
wrestle Charles T. Krellinp of the Olym
pic Club, has been accepted for the fame
occasion, and Mr. Greenland will be of
fered his expenses to come down and stand
the chance of getting a trophy.
On February 17 there will be a grand
ladies' night at the club's gymnasium.

BEANSTON OUSTED.
The Veteran Secretary of . the Board of
Education Formally Ejected by
His Successor.
George Beanston, whose office as secre
tary of the Board of Education was de
clared vacant by Superintendent of Schools
Babcock on Monday last, was ousted from
the rooms of the board yesterday morning.
Mr. Beanston had evidently consulted
his attorney regarding his right to hold
the office, for he asked Charles Welch, the
appointee of the new board, to go through
the formality of putting him out, and the
latter did so in - the most friendly manner
possible.
The ceremony consisted in Welch
placinc his hand on Beanston's shoulder
and showing him the door. This was in
tended merely as a legal measure, and
any contest that is made hereafter will be
heard in the court?.
CALLED T0 NEW FIELDS
Rev. William D. Williams Ten
ders His Resignation to
Plymouth Church.
His Sudden Determination Games a
Surprise Amen; His
Parishioners.
Great was the disappointment of W. D.
Williams, D.D., pastor of the Plymouth
Congregational Church v;hen his parish
ioners refused to accept his resignation
tendered to them by him last evening.
Last Sunday there was somewhat of a stir
in the congregation when the pastor an
nounced that at the Wednesday night
prayer meeting he wished as many of the
church members as could find it con-
I venient to be present, for he intended to
submit his resignation and have it con
sidered by them.
Previous to this eeneral announcement
the parishioners had been in ignorance of
any contemplated change in the pastor
ate of their church, but such was not the
case with the deacons. Tney had been
consulted and their advice acted upon. So
that is why the meeting-room of the
Plymouth Congregational Church was
crowded last evening.
After the usual services had been passed
Rev. Mr. Williams rose and said: "I am
glad to see so large a number here to
night."
"I tako it in a measure as a personal
gratification. I know what business you
j are expecting, I know how toe majority
â¢ will feel. You possess none but kindly
j feelings for him who stands before you. 1
I do not know what you good people will do
| this evening, but I have already said my
; resignation was final, and to those who
have asked me of my future plans 1 have
refused to say anything in reference to
them. A man would not look for a wife
before his other one was dead or divorced,
; and so it is with me. I have prospects
j and invitations, but I want first to finish
j my work here with grace, Kindness and
i resignation."
Rev. Mr. Williams then submitted the
I following resignation:
Bab Francisco, Cal., December 28, 1896.
To Plymouth Congregational Churchâ My I)ear
Brethren: 'ihanting you ail for your many
kindnesses ana expressions of esteem for my- |
fseU and family and gratefully acknowledging
your earnest co-operation, lor the Master's
sake, while It has been my privilege to serve
you as your minister, and after much prayer
ful thought and consultation with our
deacons, I have concluded to ask that my
labors Â«s your pastor shall end with the 31st
day of March, 1897, and 1 hereby tender m^
resignation, to take effect, subject to the
action of tlie church, upon said date, March
31, 1897.
Confident of your continued helpfulness
while yet among you ana humbly praying lor
your continued peace and prosperity, in time
and for eternity, I am, and hope ever to re
main, yours very sincerely,
William D. Wiilliams.
A secret ballot was then taken, and out
of the 137 votes cast 56 voted for the
resignation and 81 against it. When the
result was learned there was much ap
proval evincea, but Dr. Williams asked
that they again consider for a week, ana
next Wednesday night another meeting
will be held, and it is then expected that
the resignation will be accepted.
No reason is given for Dr. Williams' de
termination to depart unless it be to enter
new fields and engage in new work.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 7, 1897.
THE PESTHOUSE
A GRIM SPECTER
It Will Not Down at the
Improvement Clubs'
Bidding.
Like a Sore Thumb It Was in
Everybody's Way Last
Eveoing. â¢
Supervisors Will Bs Asked to Remove
the Hospital at One?, but Out
side of the City.
Nearly every part of the City was repre
sented at the meeting of the San Francisco
Associated Improvement Clubs In B'nai
B'rith Hall last evening. Several matters
of interest were discussed at length, and
particularly the Pesthole-site question.
Before that was reached a number of other
matters of business were attended to. The
newly elected officers of the club were duly
installed. They are: President, George R.
Fletcher; first vice-president, John H.
Grady; second vice-president, Dr. Salfieid;
sectetary, J. Schwartz; corresponding sec
retary, J. G. Maloney; treasurer, F. W.
Lange; sergeant-at-arms, P. H. Cahill.
Each new officer made a few appropriate
remarks.
President Fletcher then appointed the
following to the regular standing commit
tees:
Street railwaysâ L. M. Manzer. J. Wolf,
Frank Conklin, J.D. Graham, D. J. O'Leary, A.
B. Mxgulre. .
Law, legislation and public actionâ F. W.
Van Reynegom, Leon Samuels, A. L. Fritz, B.
McKinne aud Marcus Rosen-thai.
Streetsâ G. L. Center, William Mitzner, Luke
Battles. J. Rafferty, E. N. Fritz. J. S. iiauerty,
James S. Conwell.
Works, buildings and institutionâ F. W.
McEwen, Charles Ellis, Dr. E. N. Torcello, J.
P. Twohey, J. T. Sullivan, L. J. Dwyer.
Public utilitiesâ Joseph Sheehan, George A.
Raa.be, F. S. Heuston, L. H. Kohn, H. Hoffman
Jr., George Walcolm and M. F. Taylor.
James Bowlan presented a long resolu
tion, the burden of which was in condemna
tion of the blue-rock monopoly. He said
that the rattler test for rock for founda
tions for roadways is an imposition upon
the taxpayers in the interests of monopo
lies. He asked that the club condemn the
monopoly and do all in its power to throw
open to the red-rock quarry owners the
opportunity of entering into competition
for contracts for foundations for public
streets and highways. Referred to the
street committee.
Tl;e carnival of the Golden Gate sent an
invitation to the organization to partici
pate in the coming celebration and ask
ing that the improvement clubs be repre
sented in the grand parade by a float. The
following were appointed as a committee
on carnival: J. Schwartz, L. H. Kohn, C.
W. Mark, A. J. Fritz and Leon Samuels.
Vice-President Grady presented in the
form of a resolution what he called a
legislative bill to prevent blackmailing
land suits or actions. Its title is "An act
concerning actions of ejectment and ac
tions to quiet title to real estate."
The bill provides that in the riling of the
complaint in an action to recover posses
sion of real property or quiet title thereto
the Judge of the court shall require a bond
of the plaintiffs, jcint and several in form,
and in such amount, as the Judge shall
deem proper. There must be two sure
ties, each of whom shall be a freeholder
within the county. This bond shall be so
conditioned that if the action is dismissed
! or the defendant recovers final judgment
the plaintiff shall pay all costs incurred
by and all damages awarded to the
defendant. The matter was referred to
! the law committee with full power to act
and send the bill to the Legislature as soon
as possible.
Then came ihe matter that consumed
several hours in discussion. B. McKinne
offered a resolution protesting to the Board
ot Supervisors aeainst the erection of the
Pesthoune in the Almshouse district. He
said that the Pesthouse so placed would
destroy all of the attractiveness of Corbett
avenue. Also that it would be too close to
a populous portion of the City, and that it
would depreciate the value of all property
in that section of the town.
Dr. Salfield supported the resolution by
saying that all the water of the surround
ing coniitry in that locality drains into
Lake Honda, from which the City obtains
a large amount of drinking water, and
further that the main sewer system of the
City has its head in the Almshouse tract.
Hence all the disease from a pesthouse
would follow the- watercourse and flow in
the sewers through the main arteries of
the City.
The resolution caused a large amount of
discussion, the representatives of the
Pesthouse district making a strong plea to
have it removed from its present location.
The mover amended his resolution by
adding "and that the Pestlrouse be re
moved from its present location outside ot
the City and County -of San Francisco."
The original motion was passed as
amended, and will be presented to the
new Board of Supervisors at once.
Later in the evening the Pesthouse mat
ter again claimed the attention of the club,
and ex-Judge Van Reynegom offered the
following resolution, which was passed :
Segolved, That the Board of Supervisor! be
requested to have a bill prepared and urged to
passage by the Legislature authorizing munici
palities to purchase hospital-sites either inside
or outside of municipal limits.
Still fearing that the troublesome ques
tion might not be fully digested Dr. Sal
held moved that a committee of seven be
appointed to visit the coast counties near
this City, including the islands, and
search for a site for the Pesthouse and
report upon their findings at a future
meeting of the associated club 3. His re
quest was granted, as he offered to stand
all of the traveling expenses.
Dr. SalfitÂ»ld also presented an anti
funding bill resolution, which was adopted
by a rising vote.
THE FUNNY FAKER AGAIN.
"01110 I'lielan" Writes That She Will
Commit Suicide in the Park.
A letter was received at the Coroner's of
fice from one who signed the name of 01
--lie Phelan, in which the writer threatens
to commit suicide because a certain male
personage, designated aa W. D. F., refuses
to accept ihe writer's love.* The letter is
as follows:
City,- Jan 5.
Mr. Coroner: No doubt as you read this my
body will be in your office. It is my intention
to take pattern ufter Miss Groom, and my
reasons are about the same as hers. I love W.
D. F. I don't want to mention his name as I
don't want him to be annoyed with any un
pleusant notoriety. But he hates me. He says
that he can never love me ana that he has a
little girl that he adores named Mac. Well,
Mr. Coroner, I am In despair. I intend goinir to
Die park and shoot myself; sogood-by and God
bless my lost W. D. F. From
Ollik Phelan.
As the threat in the letter has not been
fulfilled so far as can be learned, the whole
affair is believed to be a fake.

CHARGES AGAINST
DOCKERY DISMISSED
No One Appeared to Press
the Accusations
Made.
Mrs. Newell Asks the Health
Board to Preserve Her
Sister's Coffin.
Committees Appointed to S?rva for
the Ensuing Year-r-Boards
to Meet
The charges against Chief Food and
Milk Inspector Dockery of the Board of
Health were dismissed yesterday because
the persons who were expected to present
the case against him failed to appear and
make public their accusations.
The board held a special meeting for
the purpose of hearing the raatter, Â«ndall
concerned were present except the com
plainants and their attorneys. The latter
sent in a communication in which they
stated that they did not care to have the
case investigated before the board because
it was an interested party.
They stated th at they did not wish the
beard to understand that the matter had
been dropped, but that it would be heard
from later. On motion of Dr. Morse the
charges were dismissed.
A pathetic scene was enacted when
Superintendent Fletcher of the Odd Fel
lows' Cemetery called upon the board for
instructions regarding the disposition of
the catkets which had contained the bodies
cremated in the incinerating department
of the burying ground. He stated that it
was the custom to destroy the cofins, but
that a Mrs. Newell had asked him to pre
serve the casket of a sister.
Mrs. Newell was present and asked to
address the board on the subject. She
said:
"1 am the twin sister of the woman who
was in this casket. She died in perfect
healthâ at least she was killed by a horse;
and you see I have so short a time to stay
here "I feel that I would like to be laid in
that same last resting-place if you could
allow it."
It was decided to allow the superin
tendent of the cemetery to retain the
casket for a time, but to require that
in future all caskets be immeuiately de-
stroyed.
The following committees were an
nounced for the rest of the term of the
board :
Health Officer and Health Departmentâ J. M.
Williamson-
Hospital Committee (Almshouse, City and
County Hospital, Twenty-sixth-street Hospital
and city physician, including Dr. McMurao)â
H. H. Hart.
Government of Receiving Hospital and
ambulance system and stations â J. F. Morse.
Finance Committeeâ H. H. Hart and J. M.
Williamson.
Food, Milt and Drugs Committeeâ J. F.
Morse.
Supplies and Printing for Health. Food and
Bacteriologist Departmentâ G. J. FitzKibbou.
Water Committeeâ J. M. Williamson.
Uniformsâ G. J. Fitzgibbon.
Litigation and Legislative Committeeâ J. F.

easesâJ. M. WilliMnoon.

Sarah E. Green, M.D., who had been ap
pointed to a position at the Twenty-sixth
street Hospital, resigned her position be
cause she was not able to stand the sur
roundings and because she thought it was
inipos-ibie to do anything to help them in
tne present institution.
"TRICK AND DEVICE."
Mrs. Roy, Manager of a Purchasing
Clubi Ordered Arrested for Petty
and Ingenious Swindling.
The troubles of the Sunset Merchandise
Club, room 114. Murphy building, will be
ventilated in the Police Court, Mrs. Eliza
beth Dorman of Oak street, one of the
members, having yesterday sworn to a
complaint in Judge Low's court, charging
Mtf. Eiizabetn Hoy, the manager of the
club, with petty larceny with trick and
device.
A stormy meeting of the members of
the club was he M on December 16, and
finally Max Light, one of the members,
agreed to carry on the club with the un
derstanding that each member would pay
up his or her assessmen t till it reached
$25. Then one-half would be paid to each
memoer who would continue nayins; again
till the amount reached $25, when the
other half would be paid. In this way
each member would pay $50 but would
only receive $25.
Mr-. Dorman had paid in $21 35 and all
attempts made by her to obtain the
amount from Mrs. Roy were futile, hence
the warrant
Many similar clubs ara flourishing in
this City and the modus operandi is well
known. There ii a drawing every week
and each member pays in the number of
cents represented by the number on the
ticket till the total amount reaches $25.
Then the member obtains an order on
some firm for goods to the value of $25.
Each drawing, however, there are two
numbers which entitle the holder to get
$25 worth of goods without paying any
lurther assessments.
Mrs. Roy, who lives at 1328 Fell street,
had not been arrested up to a late hour
last night. .
