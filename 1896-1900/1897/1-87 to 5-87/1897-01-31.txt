CUBAN AMAZONS
BRUTALLY SLAIN
Shot Down by Spaniards
While Guarding ths
Sick and Wounded.
"Women Battle Bravely in the
Night Against Oids That
Overwhelm Them.
Horrible Acts Committed by Weyler's
Forces That Should Cause the
World to Protest.
NEW YORK, X. V, Jan. 30.â A special
from Key West, Fla., says: A horrible
v comes from Ilemedio*, near Placetas.
â 4 insurgents had a large hospital where
" were quartered sick and wounded soldiers.
.Near the insurgent camp was also located
the well-known leper hospital of Cardosa,
in which were about twenty unfortunates.
Guarding the insurgent hospital was a
company of Cuban amazons, numbering
about seventy, under command of Senorita
Inez Alvarez, whose father and brothers
had teen butchered by Spaniards, and who
had taken up arms for revenge.
This hospital was in an isolated locality
and was thought to be safe from Spanish
ruolestation, but a colonel of the Spanish
r^iiuont, De Bourbona, reconnoitoring in
ustrict, learned of the hospital's lo
cation and sent 500 men to destroy it. The
B] aniardt attacked at night and fired the
buildings. The inmates and Amazon
puards awoke to find the flames roaring
about them. The sick and wounded soi
diers could not escape, but the Amazons
rushed out only to be greeted by murder
res.
The Amazons fought bravely, but they
ncre only a handful compared to the
Spaniards and were soon shot down:
Many of these were butchered, except
. whose peculiar beauty led the
<h commander t8 order them saved
for a fate worse than death. In the hos
pital there were more than seventy sick
and wounded soldiers, six surgeons and
ten nurses. Not one of these escaped, and
including the Amazons nearly 150 people
dims ;o Fpanish thirst for slanghter.
turning the Spaniards passed the
le; er hospital, which they set on f.re, and
nearly all of the inmates perished in the
1! a rues.
Another frightful story comes from
.Mutanzas province. One of Weyler's fly
i:ie squadrons discovered a batch of Cu
huts near the. great cave of Mazote, a
tamous natural curiosity in Matanzas.
paniur is proceeded to fire the hut?,
; while so engaged were fired on, four
ol the troops bains killed. The shots con
lused the Spaniards and gave the Cubans,
about lorty in number, including women
end children, time to escape to the cave of
Mazote,
The Cubans, who were led by Enrique
Rodriguez and bis five grown sons, barri
caded the cave and determined to sell
their lives dearly.
The cave had hardly been Darricaded
when the Spaniards arrived. They de
manded that the Cubans surrender, and,
this being refused, attempted to break
down the barricade. The Cubans fired,
killing and wounding-several Spaniards.
The Spaniards then managed to build, a
great fire against the mouth of the cave,
and, with riries and mscnetes ready, wait
ed for the flames and smoke to drive out
the Cubans.
Facing cremation, the. hopeless Cubans
broke through the'wall of fire only to be
greeted by a murderbusvolie.y.-. Enrique
Rodriguez and hi-s five sons and eight
other male members of the Cuban party
were killed, and several others. wounded.
These were qnickly butchered..
The Cuban women and children rushed
through the flames, but their clothing
ignited and eleven of them were "burned
to death, the Spaniards not offering, to aid
tnem. Among the women who perished
were five beautif.ul young daughters of
iKnnque Rodriguez. Six little children
ranging from 4 to 8 years were also cre
mated. In all over thirty Cubans died by
Spain's bullet?, machetes and fires. Not
a man escaped.
The survivors were Senora Rodriguez,
several other women and a few children.
They were taken to Matanzas City and
lodged in prison as enemies of Spain.

on that day purchased the steamer James
Goodall in this port ior the Cuban junta
and ntted her up as a filibuster.
On July 9 of that year the Goodall sailed
hence ostensibly for Yucatan; but it is
alleged that Roloff and Luis caused the

men and munitions of war were taken
aboard Â»nd subsequently landed on the
Cuban coast.
A second indictment for conspiracy is
found against the men in which the name
of John T. Smith, otherwise known as J.

:htt War in Cuba.
MADRID, Spain, Jan. 30.â Eroca
says that General Acarrtna, Minister of
War, has intimated in the course of con
versation that an arrangement with the
Cuban rebels looking to a cessation of hos
tilities in Cuba may possibly 8e reached
soon.
The Madrid newspapers profess belief
that the recent visit of United States Minis

Minister, was an incident of mighty influ
ence in its effect on Cuba.
DARING BURGLARS BEHIND BARS.
One of Them Confesses to a Series of
Robberies, Some of Which Were
Committed in Cal icrnia.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 30 âBurglars
entered the factory of the Gold Leaf
Manufacturing Company of George H.
Reeves between midnight and 1 o'clock
this morning and secured gold leal to the
amount of $1500. The whole contents of
the safe, containing tools, etc., were vaiued
at $6000.
The police have arrested three men, and
it is said a confession has been obtained
from one of them. According to them
two others are implicated, and the five
h&v". operated extensively west of this city.
The officers visitel a house on West
Twenty-second street and there recovered
all the stolen goods, besides several hun
dred dollars' worth of other stuff, said to
have been stolen here and in other citie?.
A few weeks ago a safe was blown open
in a Clarlc-street saloon. The money was
recovered to-day, together with some gold
watches, which led the police to believe
that the gang committed the recent $5000
robbery in Omaha. The thieves were well
known to the Chicago police and although
they are alleged to nave committed a
number of crimes in this city, are said to
have recently come from San Francisco.
If is believed they have oeen operating
throughout California.
With their arrest was recovered one of
the most elaborate burglar and safe
blowers' outfits ever brought into police
headquarters. Jewelry of almost every
description was rpcovered, and their oper
tions are supposed to have been extensive.
QUITE A MYSTERIOUS THEFT.
Package of Papers and Documents Worth
One Hundred Thousand Dollars to
the Navy Taken.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 30.â A valuable
package of papers, documents, bonds and
securities worth $100,000 to the United
States navy were lost or stolen this morn
ins at the rooming-house of Mrs. J. Orth,
1343 Michigan avenue. Captain Shaw, in
whose possession the valuable papers
were, caused the issue of Bearch warrants
for the Michigan avenue I ouse and other
places where the suspected papers might
be hidden. The papers were to be used in
a suit next week at Washington.
Captain Shaw and his wife were prer
pared to remove from their present home
to Mrs. Orth's house. He had called there,
Fen ted aiiartments and left his satchel con
taining the papers, but when he returned
the satchel was missing. Captain Shaw
refuses positively to disclose the nature of
the papers, but asserts that they were of
immense value to him.
"Some of the papers were involved in a
damage suit for nearly $100,000 and I value
them at that amount," he said. ''There
were also oilier matters of the greatest
importance in the satchel, of which I am
not at liberty to speak, and I would not
take any amount of money for them. I
was to have gone to Washington Monday
next, but wi'hout the papers my trip
would be worthless.

DEATH OF GENERAL SMITH
Wat a Veteran Commander. Who Wat
Merer defeated in linttle.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Jan. 30.-General A. J.
Smith died at his home in this city this
afternoon. The veteran has a place in
history as a commander who was never
defeated when in charge of a battle or
campaign. To him is given the credit of
saving the Banks Red River expedition
from annihilation during rerreat; of
destroying the command of Forrest, of
driving Sterling Price out of Missouri; of
being the main agent lof destruction of
Hood's army, and of causing the surrender
of Mobile.
TRIPLE MURDERER HANGED.
Makes a Statement Implicating Hia
Uncle in the Crime. â¢
SPRINGFIELD, Mo., Jan. 30.â Ed
Perry, who killed three members of the
Sawyer family in Douglas County on May
20, paid the penalty with bis life at Ava
this afternoon. The hanging drew several
thousand exHted people to the town, but
only about 200 witnessed the execution.
So intense was the desire to see ven
geance meted out that at one time it
seemed as though the excited people
would storm and tear down the stockade.
The flourish of Winchesters was all that
held the crowd at bÂ»y. Perry died from
strangulation. (Shortly before ins death,
the Rev. J. H. Briars ipade a statement
for Perry, declaring Perry's ancle, William
Yost, was guilty of connection with the
crime. Perry averred that he was pre
pared to die.
ROBBED OF A MILLION.
Railroad Companies Fleeced by a Gang of
Swindlers Whose Business Was
Forging Passes.
NEW YORK, H. V., Jan. 30.â A. W.
Weht, now u:xier arrest in Buffalo on the
charge of having secured passes over the
Delaware and Lackawanna Railroad by
means of forgery, is believed to be at the
head of a gang of swindlers who have not
confined themselves to victimizing the
railroads of free passes, but have al-o
plundered people who do business with
those connected with those corporations.
West (or, as be is known ie Jersey City,
Burns), in conjunction with two confed
erates, named, respectively, McKennaand
Stamengin, recently swindled jewelers of
that city, obtaining considerable jewelry
by means of forced certificates. The cer
tificate went to show that the}' were em
ployed on the railroads entering that city.
West's real name is said to be By nes,
and professedly he hails from Denver,
Colo. For two years railroad detectives
have been on his track.
During that period he has successfully
operated under a number of aliases. In
January, 1895, West was arrested in Chi
cago on a charge similar to that on which
he is now held in Buffalo.
In point of general scope and area of
operation the syndicate of swindlers, of
which West was the head, is probably one
of the most extraordinary discovered in
years. The . lonndation of the whole
scheme was wholesale forgery.
Orders on railways were forged, orders
from one otlicial to another were forged,
personal letters from railroad magnates
were forged, sometimes the indorsements
on tictois were forged, even the letter
heads of companies were forged â and the
man who did all the forging was West.
Some of his confederates provided him
with the letter-heads and envelopes of the
corporation which it was intended to
swidle, and by the same means he also
procured the signatures of some of the big
officials of the road.
On these letter-heads he wrote to the
presidents, superintendents or passenger
agents of other mads requesting passes.
To these letters he appended the forged
signature of some official. The passes,
which were invariably obtained, were
then placed with the scalpers who were in
touch with the WeÃt conspirators. Much
care and finesse were exercised in ask
ing for jiesses, the sale of which should
be at once safe and lucrative.
The amount made by the swindle is
placed at $1,000,000.

EVENTS OF THE . WEEK.
KYLE IS BEATEN
IN SOUTH DAKOTA
Opponents Determined to
Keep Him Out of the
Senate.
New Yorkers Suggested to the
President-Elect as Suitable
Cabinet Material.
There Is a Possibility, However, That
Dissensions May Prevent the State
From Getting a Place.
PIERRE, S. D., Jan. 30.â While those
who are ordinarily qualified to judge have
been predicting a settlement for some days
of the Senatorial situation, the facts fail
to verify the preJictions.
Mr. Kyle has been beaten for several
days, but his followers continue to stand by
him. Ihe adjournment of the caucus last
night to Wednesday was made in tho b -
lief that Kyle could not nold his force to
gether. The anti-Kyle men have settled
upon this proposition: They will unite
upon any one to beat him. While the
fusionists have been anything but a happy
family, discord is now making its appear
ance among the Republicans and they are
now too much interested in their own af
fairs to enjoy the internal warfare of their
opponents.
Some of the Republicans think that
Pickler has had a fair chance and, failing
to secure any votes from the Democrats
or Populists, he should be willing to step
aside and give some other man a chance.
He has po.led vhe full Republican voteâ
57 â which is five less than the numler re
quired to elect.
.CANTON, Ohio, Jan. 30.â Major Mc-
Kinley had many callers to-day, but he
found time to enjoy naif an hour's
sleighing. Lieutenant- Governor and Mrs.
Timothy L. Woodruff arrived at 1 o'clock
and lunched with the President-elect.
After an hour's conversation with Major
McKinley Governor Woodruff said: "I
think New York will be represented in
the Cabinet, and I hope the President
elect will choose my friend and neighbor
General Stewart L. Woodford. He is a
clean, capable and distinguisned man and
ought to be very generally acceptable. I
do not think tnere is any opposition to
Him on the part of the Brooklyn Repub
licans."
General Woodruff said that tb^e appoint
ment of Lyman J. Gage had made an ex
tremely favorably inipressiou In Eastern
business circles. The faction of the New
York Republicans which is opposea to
Mr. Phitt and tne organization was repre
sented in Canton to-day by General S. H.
Collis of New York City, who called on
Major McKinley and suggested the names
of several New York men who he thought
would make good Cabinet officers. Gen
eral C'oliis said that he thought it more
likely New York will not be represented
in the Cabinet at all than that any of the
men now prominently discussed would be
appointed.
Among Major McKinley's callers to-day
were Senator Arthur Brown of Utah and
ex- Senator W. F. Sanders of Montana.
I or the Inaugural Sail.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 30.â The
inaugural committee announces to-day
that the tickets for the inaugural ball are
now ready for distribution. Each ticket
will be accompanied by a souvenir, which
is exceedingly handsome and is included
in the price of the ball ticÃets â $5. Orders
by mail will be filled in the order of re
ceipt. No complimentary tickets will be
iÂ»sued exowt to President-elect Mc-
K.inley and Mrs. JlcKmley.
NOT JUST A PRESENT.
Comptroller Eckels Cannot He Ousted
for Oxer a Tear let.
CANTON, Ohio, Jan. 30.â The report
that President-elect McKinley has decided
at this early day to appoint Charles G.
Dawes Comptroller of Currency is not
only denied at Canton but bears the
marks of a canard on its face, as Comp
troller Eckels' term will not expire until
April, 1898, or a year and a month after
Mr. McKinley's inauguration. Mr. Eckels
cannot bo removed without cause by the
incoming administration. The position
of Comptroller is shown to be a peculiar
one by the following act:
"The Comptroller of the Currency shall
be appointed by the President on the
recommendation of the Secretary of the
Treasury, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, and shall hold office
for the terra of live years, unless sooner
removed by the President upon reasons to
be communicated by him to the Senate."
This indicates that the power of the
President in the matter is slight. It will
be Mr. Gage, as Secretary of the Treasury,
who will have the selection of the Comp
troller, according to the law quoted, and,
while that gentleman would defer to the
wish of his chief in the matter, the execu
tive rests with him.
DEPEW TALKS ON HARD TIMES.
Says They Will Be Still Worse, but After
Needed Legislation Business Will
Boom Next Fall.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 30.-Chauncey
M. Depew, in an interview to-day With a
reporter of the United Associated Presses,
predicts better times, but Bays they will
become worse before they improve and
that an extra session of Congress must be
called to settle the policies in regard to
the tariff, currency and foreign affairs be
fore there is any improvement in existing
conditions. Continuing, he said:
"We have had three years of financial
panic. The result is a los 3of credit and
impaired confidence. We find, too, that
there is no foreisrn money coming into the
country. Neither are foreigners inter
ested in any of our new enterprises. The
enormous amount of money deposited in
our banks and trust companies is locked
up and remains so; manufacturers fear to
accumulate stocks and work on the hand
to-mouth principle. Dealers buy only for
their immediate needs. The outputs from
iron and coal mines are reduced to a
minimum; blast and coke furnaces are do
ing but little; the tonnage of railroads â
the most significant of all figuresâ proves
how abnormally light is the movement of
commerce. Prosperity depends on the
purchasing power of the people. When
times are good the vast army of wage
earners spend freely, but now economy is
the word and the barest necessities are
purchased. This slackened demand of
the wage-earner and his opportunities for
work grows less and less.
"Privation cannot be confined to one
class alone. Hard times among the work
ingmen are invariably the symptom of
hard times among everybody, and so the
country at large is undergoing a season of
hardship and depression. Hard times
here injure our reputation rfbroad. I
have in my possession a letter from an
eminent European statesman asking if it
is true that tocialistic revolt is raging herÂ«
and whether it will culminate in attacks
on property and vested interests. Rumors
like these destroy our prestige. There is
no arguing foreign capitalists in the face
of the fact that our expenditures are now
in excess of our revenue*. The situation
we are called upon to face is scarcely less
grave than actual war. Cougress must
not shirk its responsibilities. It should
find means tofigut thedaneer that threat
ens us as a people. Times will grow worse
nntil Congress acts.
"If, in >ur extra , session, a moderate
â tfiT'rtt bill is passed; industries paralysed
by â¢ the ' Wilson bill will be revived, the
profits of the ;:irm returned to the farmer,
and. there will be a cnange for the better
all around. Such a measure once passedâ
and.it certainly will be â will remain good
for four years; by next fall there will be an
unprecedented revival in all branches of
business. After the tariff there should be
some legislative action in regard to our
currency which will do away with such
possibilities as came to the surface in the
late f campaign, and which arise from a
non-elastic currency. It was this quality
of currency which led so many honest
men last November to vote for a change
which promised them better monetary
conditions. This legislation will give
confidence to investors, money-lenders
and capitalists.
"As to the foreign policy I can' only say
that if a Government is determined to
protect its flag, its prestige and its citizens,
it cannot go far wrong. I am assured
that this determination is to be the key
note of the foreign policy of the new ad
ministration." ,
GREAT RAILROAD MAN DEAD.
George B. Roberts, President of the Penn
sylvania Company, Relieved of His
Worldly Cares.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa.. Jan. 30. â
George B. Roberts, president of the Penn
sylvania Railroad, died at his resident c
hi this city at 4:30 o'clock this afternoon.
Mr. Roberts' life from boyhood almost
was a history of the Pennsylvania Rail
road Company, for when he was not yet
out of his teens he entered the service of
that corporation and by industry, ability
and attention to the thousand and one
details of railroading, advanced from one
position to another until he reached the
presidency of the great corporation.
Mr. Roberts in character was a plain
man and sought but little distinction and
place in the social world, but devoted all
his time and ability to the forwarding of
the interests of the company wiih which
he was identified.
He was recognized by railroad mae
na'es and financiers as their equal in the
world of business, and his interest and
opinions were nought and respected, and
by the shareholders, directors and co
workers in the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company he was conceded to be the di
rectine brain of the ereat enterprise.
Mr. Roberts' unosteniatiousness, firm
ness and justice endeared him to the em
ployes of ihe company, and not since the
great strike in Pittsbnrg in 1877 has there
oeen any serious difficulty with the em
ployes of the road.
He began his career as a rodman in an
engineering corps on the Allegheny and
Savannah division, and in 1856, when only
19 years of age, he reached the position of
assistant engineer of the Philadelphia and
Erie Railway. During the next ten years
he was actively engaged in the location
and construction of the various divisions
of the Pennsylvania Railway in this State
and New Jersey. His services brought
dim into the notice ot his superiors, and
in 1862 Mr. Roberts was made assistant to
President J. Edear Thompson.
His engineering abilities and executive
capacity were developed by seven years
at work in this position, and in 1869 he
was promoted to the position of fourth
vice-president. Almost immediat ly
afterward he was promoted to second
vice-preÂ«ident. On June 3. 1874, when thÂ«
lato Colonel Thomas A. Scott succeeded
Mr. Thompson in the presidency of the
road Roberts was advanced to the position
ot first vice-president, and on June 1, 1880.
Colonel Scott resigned the presidency and
Mr. Roberts, as his logical successor, was
chosen for the bead of the corporation.
Since that time Mr. Roberts has been
re-elected annually, and under his man
agement be has seen the road grow with
leaps and bounds until to-day its railroad
system is unsurpassed by any railroad in
the world.

MERRY WEEK FOR
THE JUNKETERS
Legislators Ed joy Luxury
During Their Tours of
the State.
On These Jaunts They Purchase
Railroad Tickets With the
Taxpayers' Money.
Whili Institutions Are Being "In
spected" It Might Ba Well to
Examine the Capitol.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 30.â This
has been a week of junketing by members
of both houses, a large number of Sena
tors and Assemblymen even now riding
in Pullman coaches, snoring in Pullman
palace-car ber:hs, dining at a dollar or
more a head in Pullman dining-cars and
feasting on roast turkey and cranberry
sauce in public institutions. They are
not traveling on railroad passes either,
and it is now a most refreshing sight to
see Senators and Assemblymen, wiih a
locomotive cow-catcher sticking out of
their coattail pockets, standing in post
oiiico file at the ticket-seller's window
and actually paying cash for their tickets,
just the same as plain common people.
Just the same, however, the plain com
mon people pay for those railroad fares,
those deligntful "free" dinners of baked
fowl and wine, those rcstfal snores in the
Pullman sleeper.
Those who were present in the Assem
bly at the beginning of the session of this
week were not moved to tears and ap
plause by the heroic stand of tlie Populist
members, whom Speaker Coombs, with
the relentless cruelty of an Ashantee
King, was forcing to Â«o on these junkets
at the expense of our dear people, with
whom the minority at every session is
madly infatuated. Alas! the pen sheds
black tears as it records the fact that
when Populist and Fusion and Demo
cratic members were appointed to accom
pany the touring committees they never
said a word in favor of that economy, that
retrenchment, that reform, for which they
howled so hard during the campaign that
theairturned blue with the noise of it.

Four years ago Eczema made its appearance

did not leave the house. I had a tine head of '
hair, seven years' growth, and had to sacrifice
it. I was in despair. The physicians had failed
even to relieve me, when one of them recom-
mended Ccticuka Soap. I used three boxes
of Cuticcra (ointment), one half dozen cakes
of Ccticura Soap, and one bottle of Cuti-
cttba Resolvent, and in three weeks from
the time I began, the scales had left my face
and the skin lost its florid hue. In six weeks

â¢No; they did not protest; they did not go
into heroics, but took the jnunt just as
nicely as a babe its mother's milk.
L iok at the Democrats and fused-ont-of
identity Populists who appeared before
the Duckworth investigation committee
yesterday* They coolly informed the
committee that although they knew the
mileage bill contained illegal and improper
charge t ey voted for it because $104 of
the people's money was too small a sum
"to waste any time over."
Legislative visits to State institutions
are more costly than benelicial to the tax
payers. No good is accomplished by
them. They serve as brilliant opportuni
ties for superintendents to display those
social qualifications which have made
them successful In politics. The side
board and the dining-table put the Popu
list and Democratic Legislators in the
same. happy, complacent and genial frame
of mind as the Republicans, who ar.e no
better. Telephones hello, brass band?
blare, the electric spark flashes informa
tion to the superintendents of State insti
tutions days ahead of the legislative visit.
The house isearnished, the floors scrubbed
and sanded and the household skeletons
stowed away in the darkest corner of the
cellar.
It is strange that no committee has been
appointed to investigate the Capitol build
ing. It is in a frightfully unwholesome
condition, the air of the basement and of
the ro^ms on the ground floor being
saturated with malaria. The house is
warmed on the same principie as a loco
motive is fired. Coal is shoveled into the
furnaces and if the rooms get too hot all
you have to do is to throw open a window
and eaten pneumonia. Yesterday the
Supreme Court-chamber, in which sat the
Duckworth committte, was heated to 100
degrees Fahrenheit in the shade. Mem
bers,visitors and witnesses perspired in the
stuffy air; when they left the room they
shivered i;i their overcoats. The cement
used in laying the fancy mosaic til in X in
the rottinda and corridor of the second
floor has lost its slicking quality, or,
rather, never had any, and every few days
a tile or two tilts under -the heel and is
kicked over the floor.
liuring the first few dayd of the session
a mason was enGra^ed in re-laying thosa
detached pieces of terra cotta, but they
are breaking loose in other spots, and the
mason has a good chance of holding the
v job for life if he nurses it carefully.
A gang, of plumbers has been engaged
during the past week in taking apart and
setting again the brass ventilator tubes,
they having sprung a leak or met with
some similar accident. There is no sys
tem of ventilation in the building, and for
that reason the State officials who are
compelled to make their abode in it liter
ally take their lives in their hands.
But in the way of waste and extrava
gance the present session is a vast im
provement over its predecessors. Old
timers remember that locksmiths were
employed at the opening of each biennial i
session to put new locks on the doors of |
all the commi;tee-rooms and furnish keys i
for the same, the former locks and keys j
bt-ing regularly stolen. They remember J
also that at the close of the sessions, ruem-.i
bers, committee clerks and-other attaches
were obliged to buy Saratoga trunks in
which to pack the fine linen paper and
envelopes, quarts of ink and mucilage,
leadpencils and penholders and boxes of
pens by the gross, which they carried to
their homes. Bv-the-by, it is reported
that some of- those piggish people have
become Populists.
Locks and keys" are no longer stolen,
and legislative. Saratoga trunks have gone
out of style with the adoption of the rule
allowing each member $25 worth of sta
tionery. But this rule has led to another
abuse. A large proportion of the mem
bers draw the $25 in cash, sink it in their
pockets and sponge the most of their sta
tionery from the clerk* at the desk. The
rues should be amended so that the sta
tionery, ana not cash, should be druwn.
RECORD-BREAKING SENATE.
A'o Time T.ost in Oratory, and Prompt
Cioii ittrratlon of Hutines*.
SACRAMENTO, Cat.., Jan. 30.â This is
a recom-breakinz session of the Senate,
so fur as the amount of work disposed of
is concerned. At the close of the first
four weeks it has 165 bills on the way to
third reading, something entirely unpre
cedented in the history of that body. At
the last session only tnirty-tive bills Lad
passed their second reading.
This promise < w*ell for every bill tliat
has thus far bg^n introduced and for
thosf to come, for all will have a fair show
to be heard and be passed upon. Few
bills are Jikely to on the second-read
ing tile. The slaughter thus effected in
pievious sessions has been something
fearful.
The remarkable progress indicated is
entirely due to the unusual business ca
pacity displayed by the Senators, both in
committee and on the floor. Little time
is considered in oratory and when a bill
is presented to the consideration of the
Senate for favorable action it has gen
erally been pruned of its objectionable
features.
In the committee meetings the views
of the rnemoers of the committee consti
tute only a small portion of the dis
cussion. Every important bill is sub
jected to t c criticism of tho-e on the out
side wlio are most directly interested in
its provisions. Business in committee is
greatly accelerated by the excellent se
lections that have been made in the chair
man-hips. This is notably the case in trie
Committee on Commerce, Gleaves chair
man; Committee (in Corporations, Dick
inson chairman; County Government and
Townshin Orsanization, Smith ciiairman ;
Education and Pudlic Morals, Boyce
chairman; Elections, Stratton chairman ;
Finance, Voorheis chairman ; Irrigation,
Androus chairman; Judiciary, Simpson
ihuirruan; J_,;ibor und Capital, Moore
aouse chairman; Claims, Bulla chair
man.
It is expected that the floor of the cor
ridors leading from the Senate to the As
sembly will be kept warm with the fleet
ing of the Senate messengers to announce
the pas-age of Senate bills to the As
sembly.
DONE IN THE ASSEMBLY.
Sjira/cer Coomb* : Caution* a Committee
*ot to lUutil >te Hill*.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., . Jan. 30. âThe
Assembly this morning took up the
second reading of the tile.
When biil 46. regulating labor condi
tions in sawmills and lumber camps, was
reached, it was discovered that many
erasures had been made. Coombs asked
how thif happened to which Sanford,
author of the bill, replied that the erasures
had been made by the Committee on
Labor and Capital.
Dennery stated that the erasures were
ma.le by the clerk, in conformity to
amendments made by tho committee.
'lhi.< was not altogether satisfactory, and
tne b;il wa- ordered sent back to the com
mittee, the chair statmg that such muti
lations' were not only improper as a
metnod oi amendment but constituted a
felony.
Assembly bill 45, relating to the pay
ment o; waj^es by corporations, was re
turned with several committee amend
niP!'tÂ«. An additional amendment was
offered by Sow.ird extending the regula
tion to companies and individual employ
er-.
Helshaw thought wages should be paid
up to the last day of the preceding
month.
Belshaw moved that the Committee on
Constitutional Amendments be requested
to report back amendment 23, providing
for the abolition of the railroad commis
sion on Monday, stating that the ten days
will expire on that day.
Caminetti introduced a bill providing
for the construction and maintenance of
State highway s.
A bill was introduced by Sanford mak
inc an appropriation for legis.ative print
ing during the session, and gave notice
that he wouid on Monday ask that It be
placed on the emergency file. This is in
an tici nation of a veto by the Governor of
the bili appropriating $75,000 for the print
ing oflice.
A petition from thecitizens of Reolands
was presented, asiing that do law be
passed which will vÂ»-evens municipalities

AN UNPOPULAR MEASURE.
Opposition to th* mil Relating to Dairy
Inspection and IH*ea*ed Animal:
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 30.â of
the most discussed measures among the
Senators between. sessions r and one that
promises to give rise to much excited de
bate on the floor, when it comes up for
reading, is the bill introduced by Senator
Dickinson relating to the inspection of
dairies, the health of dairy animals and
the prevention of contagious and infec
tious diseases among such animals. .
This is a measure that has more dopu
lar interest than anything before the
Legislature at the present lime. While
it directly affects the dairymen of the
State, it indirectly, but not les? import
antly, come? home to every consumer of
the lacteal nuid and its products. While
the objects of the bill, the extermination
of all diseased dairy animals and the as
surance thereby of pure miik, butter and
cheese meet with t'.ie hearty and unani
mous approval of all the legislators, the
methods by means of which these highly
desirable ends are to be attained are far
from having the confidence or support of
the members.
Senator Morelronse of Santa Clara is
one of these who are outspoken in their
opposition to the measure as favorably re
ported by the Senate Committee on Fi
nance. The bill makes it tiie duty of the
agent or assistants of the State Dairy
Bureau to inspect all dairies and cream
eries in the State at least once a year,
more particularly to discover the exist
ence of animals affected with bovine
tuberculosis and to provide for their ex
tirpation. It provides for the appoint
ment by the Dairy Bureau of Veterinary
Surgeons who are to finally pass upon the
condition of all suspected animals and
gives the dairy bureau also the power to
appoint as many assistant agents as in its
judgment may be necessary to carry out
the provisions of the act.
The compensation of such veterinary
surgeons and assistant agents is left en
tirely to the discretion of the bureau. It
a'so provides that all assistant agents shall
have had practical experience in the manu
facture of dairy products.
That section which provides for the com
pensation to the owners for cattle con
demned to be killed, owing to their dis
eased condition, is the bete noir of the
members. For this purpose and the other
expenses and salaries creased by the bill,
an appropriation of $90,000 was oripinally
asked. In the bill reported by the jp'i nance
Committee the amount is reduced to
$45,000.
"I see no reason," said Senator More
house in speaking of the measure to-day,
"why the State should be called upon to
pay for stock ordered to bo killed on ac
count of tueir diseased condition. If I
were the owner of diseased cattle that
would be my fault or misfortune, and if it
becomes necessary for the State to kill my
diseased stock I see no reason why the
people of tbe State should pay me for it
any more than if the cattle shodld die. I
don't think I wonld have any right to
complain of the operations of the act,
even if it did not provide for indemnity
for the cattle killed.
"There is no limit," he continued, "to
the compensation to be made for the ani
mals killed, and there is no telling what
they might do under the cover of the act.
It provides that the agents shall fix the
value of the animals killed. I hold that
if & cow is diseased so as to unlit her for
the use of a dairyman, she has no value.
The value of anything is what It can be
sold for, and no one would be willins to
buy a condemned animal. I think that
this is a very expensive experimental
proposition and one whi ;h, if consistently
carried out, would require an appropria
tion of about $ 1,000,000. The cat lie inter
ests of California, according to the last re
port of the State Board of Equalization,
are placed at $10,000,000.
"A conservative estimate is that 10 per
cent ot these will have to be condemned,
and if the State is to make compensation
for them it will take $1,000,000 to pay for
the stocK killed alone, leaving out of con
sideration the salaries and expenses of a
corps of veterinary surgeons and assistant
agents.
"While it may be necessary for the
proper sanitary condition of the people to
have cattle killed, I do not believe the
people should be taxed to pay for such
cattle. It would be just as fair to ask
them to compensate the frun-erower who
has a poor crop of prunes, or to pay a man
for his house which has been destroyed
by fire or to indemnify him for any other
kind of business misfortune that chanced
to overtake him. These are the reasons
why I shall oppose the passage of the
bill."
GENERAL LEGISLATION.
Many Bills Introduced to Properly J'ro-
tpri Labor.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 30.âAmeri
can labor is receiving more attention at
the hands of this Republican Legislature
than ever before in the legislative history
of California. A large number of bills,
most of them sensible and practicable,
have been introduced and ail of them
have been published at length in The
Call, with the exception of the following,
which arrived from the State Printer's
office to-day:
Assembly bill 547, by Kelly:

board of three arbitrators for the adjust
ment of grievances and dispu:es between
employer and employe. Two will bo se
lected irom the two parlies casting the
greatest and the next greatest number of

sides of their track and property. In case
they do not make and maintain such fence, if
their engine or cars shall kill or maim any
cattle or other domestic animals upon their
Hue of road they must pay to ijie owner of
such cattle or domestic animals a fair market
price for ihe same, unless it- occurred through
the neglect or fuult of the owner.of the animal
so killed or so maimed. Railroad corpora
tions paying to the owners of the
land through or along which their
road is located an agreed price for making and
maintaining such fence, or paying the coil of
such fence with the award for damages
allowed for the right of way for such railroad,
are relieved and exonerated from nil claims
for damages arising out of the killing or
maimine of any animals or persons who thus
fail to construct and maintain such fence;
and the owners of such animals are respon
sible for any damages or loss which may
accrue to such corporation from such animals
being upon their railroad track resulting
from ihe-non-construction of such fence, un
less it is shown that such loss or damage oc
curred through tbe negligence of the corpora
tion, its officers, agents or employes.
The interests of manufacurers are being

THE TREATY MAY FAIL.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Nearly Evenly Divided on the Sub
ject of Arbitration.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 30.â Every
member of the Senate Committee on tor
ei^n Relations, with the exception of
Turpie, was present this morning when
the committee convened, a few minutes
before 11 o'clock, to discuss the arbitration
trea ty.
At 1:30 o'clock this afternoon a vote was
taken on the treaty and a favorable report
ordered made to the Senate next Monday,
with certain amendments. This action
was not unanimous, and some individual
amendments were reserved for submission
to the Senate when the subject shall come
up. The most important amendment was
that which adds to the end of article I the
words, "but no question which affects the
foreign or domestic policy of either of the
high contracting parties or the relations
of either with any other state or power by
treaty or otherwise shall be subject to ar
bitration under this treaty, uuless by a
special agr ement."
The second amendment strikes out all
relerence to his Majesty, the King of Nor
way and Sweden, as the umpire in case
the court fails to agree uoon an umpire
in accordance with the provisions of arti
cle 111 and article V. The motion to
strikeout this clause was carried witli but
one negative vote â that of Senator Gray
of Delaware.
It was decided that the treaty should be
called up In the Senate at tiie earliest day
possible. The question of its possible
consideration in open session was dis
cussed informally.
It is understood that while members of
the committee believe that such a motion
may prevail if maie, no member will imi
tate it. This motion, however, will find
some votes in the membership of the com
mittee.
The vote on the final motion to report
the treaty to the Senate, as amended, was
so close tr.at it startled some friends of
the convention, who believed that there
will be practically no opposition to the
amended treaty.
When the roll was called the votes were
cast as follows: In favor of reporting the
treaty to the Senate, Sherman, Davis,
Frye, JLod^e, Cullom (R.), and Gray (D.)
â total G; against reporting the treaty to
the Senate, Morgan, Mills, Daniels (D.),
and Cameron (R. ) â total 4.
An amendment was also offered insert
ing a cause stating in positive terms that
the Alaskan boundary question should
not be submitted to arbitration under this
treaty, but it was rejected by the same
vote of 6to 4. It will be offered in the
Senate.
The debate in the committee developed
an opposition to tl>Â« treaty under any con
ditions that was entirely unexpected ; and
if the minority of the committee represent
a | roportionate membership of the Sen
ate tlie indications are that the treaty will
have a bard time securing the requisite
two-thirds vote.

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 30.â United
States Benator-elect T. C. Platt, accom
panied by Mr 3. Platt, left New York at
noon to-day for Jacksonville. So tightly
has Mr. P^att been fastened down to uusi
ness and politics that he has not had what
ordinary citizen* speak of as a vacation in
the last fifteen years, and *vhile he has
desired on a number of occasions to go
abroad wiÂ»h Mrs. Platt he has never seen
nis way clear to do so. He looks forward
to this trip with a great deal of pleasure.
Mr. Platt had any number of visitors
last night at the Fifth-avenue Hotel to
wish him good-by. First came Edward
Lauterbach, president of the Republican
County Committee. i\lr. L:\uterbacu, it is
leurned, desires no further responsibility
at this moment than those that rest on
his shoulders as head of the New York
machine. There had been some talk of
requesting Mr. Lauterbach to become the
spokesman for the Republicans of the
State of New York in Platt's absence.
"Nonsense," saiu Mr. Lauterbach, when
the subject was brought to his attention;
"that was only talk, but I confess it was
very amiable talk on the part of my
friends."
In Mr. Piatt's absence, therefore, Rep
resentative B. B. Odell Jr., chairman of
the executive committee of the State Com
mittee, may be the spokesman of the Re
publicans of the State of New York. Mr.
Oiell said he would probably be at the
Fifth-avenue Hotel tho latter part of each
week in Mr. Piatt's absence.
The appointment of Lyman J. Gage to
be Secretary of the Treasury gives general
satisfaction to the bankers of New l'ork.
There is absolutely no foundation in the
reports that have been circulated that
local financiers were opposed to him.
This is indicated by the fact that Mr.
Gage, when first mentioned for the Cabi
net, was warmly ureed to take the place
by many bankers of this city. Many out
of-town bankers urged Mr. Gage to accept
the position. Among them were: Sey
mour Dexter, president of the Mew York
State Bankers' Association; W. C. Corn
well, president of the City Bank of Buf
falo, with seven or eight other Buffalo
bankers; James Ashley, president of the
Merchants' Bank of Rochester, and all
other Rocnester bankers; F. W. Barker,
president of the Robert Gere Bank of
..Syracuse; George M. Trontman, president
of the Central Bank of Philadelphia; Ben
jamin B. Comegys, president of the Phila
delphia National Bank, and Thomas P.
JtJeal, president of the Boston Clearing
house Association.
Police Commissioner Roosevelt has won
the hearts of the labor men by a recent
visit to their stamping-ground at Claren
don Hall, and when he stood up at the tear
with the leaders on Wednesday evening
and joined them in a social glass of ale the
conquest was completed. After Mr. Roose
velt went home the meeting declared its
approval of him as a man, and yesterday
it was learned tbat a number of the lead
ers are now in favor of Mr. Roosevelt
for Mayor of Greater New York. John
O'Connell of the Ciearmakers' Interna
tional Union said yesterday :
"Mr. Roosevelt made a tine impression
on all of us. He is too good for the place
he now hoHs. He ought to be the next
Mayor of Greater New York. When he
was in the Assembly in 1884 ana 1885 he
worked hard to abolish the tenement
house cigar factories. He did not do this
to get voies, for he was from the Fiftb
aveuue district and it would not have
helped him there."
The bal masque to be given by Mrs.
Bradley-Martin at the Waldorf on Febru
ary 10 continues to be a lruitlui theme for
discussion both pro and con among all
grades of society. No social event of re
cent years at least has given rise to a
tithe of the animated and, at times, viru
lent arguments on both sides of the ques
tion. Incidentally Mrs. Mary Ellen
Lease, in v characteristic interview, has
set the seal of her disapproval upon the
affair. Airs- Bradley-Martin has received
dozens of threatening letters in connec
tion with the ball. Some of them have
been of so incendiary a character as to in
dicate they were written by anarchists.
The members of labor organizations do
not share the views of the Rev. Dr. Rains
ford with regard to the ball, but the mem
bers of the mu-ical protective union are
very much agitated over a report that
Mrs. Bradley-Martin will engage the
marine band of Washington to nfrnish
the promenade music, and that conse
quently they are not to get a single dollar
of the gnat amount that that lady is to
spend. Alexander Breraer, president of
the union, expressed himself in emphatic
language on the subject yesterday. Said
he:
"We have as good musicians in our
union in New York as can be found any
where, even in the capitals of Europe, and
they are all citizens and taxpayers here
and many of them have families to sup
port The members of the Marine Baud
have an assured income from their pay, and
are fed and clothed and sheltered by the
Government, and do not urgently need
the money that they will get from the
ball. Our urion has on several occasions
protested to the President, the Secretary
of War and the Secretary of the Navy
against allowing military bands to play
for private parties and thus preventing our
people from earning money."
Bob Fitzsimmons was all smiles yester
day. He said that if by any unfortunate
accident in the course of events he and
Corbett cannot come together in Nevada,
he would be willing to go to Jerusalem, so 1
anxious was he to get at 'Pompadour
Jim." Fitz's money is not all tip; Cor
bett's is. Bnt Fitz has eighteen days yet
in which to put up his cash, according to
agreement, nt wh;ch time Dan Stuart must"
put up 110.000 more, or $15,000 in all, as a
guarantee thai he will provide a place in
which the fight can be decided failure of
which will result in the forfeiture of the
$15,000 to Corbett and Fitzsimmons.
'"There need be no worry about the fight
not coming off, " said a Corbett adherent
last night, "even if Fitzsimmons does not
put up another cent, I know what I am
talking about when I say that In order to
rneot Fitzsimmons Corbett will a^ree to
enter the ring without any side bet at all.
If Fitzsimipons cannot raise the money
all Corbett wants is to know it, and he is
perfectly willing to make all the conces
sions in the world."
Dan Stuart will have pictures taken of
the fight, and he has made satisfactory
arrangements with both Corbett and Pitz
simmona. It is understood that each will
receive a third of the money paid by ibe
kinetoscope company.
Al Smith refused to talk much last night
about tue fiyht. "There will surely be a
fight," said he. "Nothing on earth can
stop them. Now that the Governor of
Nevada has signe.l the bill legalizing box
ing, Stuart is sure to have nothing but
money.
"It will be one of the cheapest and great
est fights ever known. I say cheap, be
cause a $15,000 purse is ridiculously small
for two men who nave been extensively
advertised for the cast three years.
Stuart's expenses will probably be $40,000â
$15,000 for the purse, $10,000 for erecting
the arena and $15,000 for outside matters.
He will unquestionably erect a building
capable of seating 20,000 persons. Sup
posing that half of tnat number attend,
which seems a certainty, his gate receipts
alone, besides what he will receive from
the railroads, will amount to $150,000, at
an average admission fee of $15. This
will leave him a profit of more than
$100,000, not counting bis profits from the
kineioscope."
Parson Davids said: "Corbett and Fitz
sircrnons will surely meet. Ido not think
that the East will be largely represented
at the fight. New Orleans is much nearer
than Carson City, Reno or Virginia City,
in one of which places I thint the tight
will take place, and yet at New Orleans
tbera were but 200 or 300 of the local
sports present. Will I go? Of course I'll
go, and bo will a large number of my
friends. But the cost of the trip, which,
in my estimation, will be something like
$300, will deter a grsat many from going.
"Stuart, however, will not have to de
pend on the Â£a-lern men to fill the arena.
The sporting men from San Francisco,
Seattle, Spokane, St. Lmis, St. Paul and
Minneapolis and all the big Western c.i'.ies
will be there. Chicago will send a large
delegation."
Jake Kennedy, Cnarley White and Billy
Madden expressed themselves in much
the 3ume way as Mr. Davies.
Corbett is the favorite in this city. At
Del ruonico's last nigfit a bet of $1000 to
$700 was made that he would win the
fight. .
LOUD`S POSTAL BILL.
Friends and Opponents of the Measure
Are G.ven a Hearing Before the
Senate Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. GL, Jan. 30.â A
hearing was given this morning by the
Senate Committee on Postofiicesand Post
roads to persons interested in what has
come to be known as the Loud bill, re
cently passed by the House of Represen
tatives and applying to the postage on
second-class maill matter.
Ten o'clock was the hour fixed for the
hearing, but the only member of the com
mittee then or for the next half hour pres
ent was Mr. Chandler, acting chairman in
the absence of Mr. Wolcott.
Governor Cleaves addressed the commit
tee. The act, he said, would affect many
of the interests and would withdraw many
ot the great privileges now enjoyed by the
people.
H. N. Wheeler said the proposed act
would grant subsidies to the express con*
panics. In seme of iiis remarks be came
in conflict with Representative Loud, who
was present, and who questioned some of
Wheeler's statements.
Patrick Farreil of New York, represent
ing the American News Company, ursjed
Senator Chandler not to insist on his fir.st
amendment striking out the words "or
when sent from a news aeency, or from
other news agents," ana be also suggested
such an amendment of the bill as would
allow newsdealers the "return privilege"
on unsold copies,
FinJey Acker of Philadelphia, chairman
of the postal committee of the National
board of Trade, presented resolutions of
that organization in iavor of the Loud
bill.
Replying to auesHons, Mr. Acker said
the National Board of Trade favored
penny postage, but had no desire to carry
it until some of tbe abuses were elimi
nated from the second-class matter. The
Posloffice Department, he said, was nearer
to the people than any branch of the Gov
ernment. The poor people recognized the
United States PosUftice Department as
the branch to which they gave their alle
giance. Great benefits had been conferred
upon them in carrying to tliem since 1799
their mail practically postage free â carry
in? to them good books, good magazines
and good newspapers.
These privileges were near to the com
mon school system. It was said, however,
that bad books and bad publications were
going through the mails, exercising a cor
rupting and debauching influence en the
youth of the country, and that that
should be stopped. If that were so, Con
gress had the power to correct these
abuses under the present law, without
revolutionizing the whole postal system
and destroying the whole fabric because
there were one or two rotten limbers
found in the. structure.
Governor Cleaves said there was no
doubt that Congress bad the power to re
peal this law at any time, but there were
equitable rights which should be respected.
A liberal construction of the postal laws,
he believed, would meet the approval and
commendation of the whole American
people.
Senator Chandler remarked that he had
offered an amendment to the Loud bill for
one cent postage for the purpose of sug
gesting the question whether it would not
be better to carry letters at cost than to
carry second-class matter at less than
cost.
John Elderkin of the committee of New
York publishers opposing the bill, made a
remark as to the National Board of Trade,
which he spoke of as a "one-horse affair."
Secretary Bryant of the American
Newspaper Publishers' Association stated
that the association had unanimously
adopted a resolution indorsing the Loud
bill and that there had been no dissent to
that resolution since.
The meeting was closed with a brief ad
dress by Mr. William of the Iron Age in
support of the bill and with the presenta
tion of some statistics in opposition to ii.
Senator Chandler stated that there
would be no further bearings on the sub
ject unless by order of a majority of the
committee.

THANKFUL
To testify to the benefit and cure that I hayÂ«

For four years I have been ailinsr with ner-

which greatly hindered me in my work as a
teamster, the business I have pursued for the
past seven years in San Francisco. I suffered
with pain and oppression of the chest and
stomach, shortness of breath, flatulent dyspep-

January 4, 1897, I applied
FOR
Treatment- at the Institute, where DR. W. K.

found that my heart and stomach were both
disordered. . I was placed under treatment and
at once began to Improve rapidly and feel Ilka

prescribed certain electric fluids for interne;

These remedies combined Dave had a magicJL

VERY THANKFUL FOR SUCH A RAPID

Nansens to Be Lioniz dâ Lady
Scott's Easy Life.
LONDON, E.va, Jan. 30.â Since the
Irish of the House of Commons withdrew
their amendment to the address in reply
to the Queen's speech, wnich amendment
referred to the financial relations be
tween Great Britain and Ireland, it is seen
that they made a serious tactical error,
which was equivalent to allowing Mr.
Bnlfour, the Government .lender in the
House, to spike their guns. A prompt
and energetic opposition to the suspension
of the financial question might have been
effective in carrying the votes of the Irish
Unionists, but now it will be useless to op
pose the commission, which will be sup
ported by ail the Unionists and by a num
ber of Scottish and English Liberals. The
question, instead of bearing solely on the
financial relations between Great Britain
and Ireland, will develop into an inquiry
as to the financial reunions between the
different parts of the United Kingdom.
Tne Scottish and Welsh members of the
House insist that their respective claims
Eiiall be considered, and the English Radi
cals iiemand an inquiry into the matter of
ttie taxation of the various classes in the
k.ngdom. Nevertheless the session will
no: be barren for Ireland if the Govern
ment's proposal to transfer the Irish pri
vate bill legislation lrom Westminster to
Dublin tak^s the form of a bill.
The tenor of tne Irish section of the
Queen's speech and the Government's de
penaence upon time render the ap
pearance of such a measure doubtful, but
it would undoubtedly pass if the Govern
ment should submit it. All the Irish
members are eager for such a bill, foresee
ing that it would transfer much power and
the expenditure ot niuch money to Dub
lin.
Tbo amendment made Thursday in the
House of Commons by Mr. Mac Lean to
the motion of Colonial Secretary Cuamber
lain f<_r the reapr>ointruent.of the commis
sion to inquire into the affairs of the
British South African Company is indica
tive of the feeliug that prevails in inliu
tial quarters regarding any investigation
of South African matters. Mr. Maclean's
amendment was to the" effect that as the
troubles in South Africa had been settled
peaceably and as the leader's of the raid
into the Transvaal had Deen punished it
was needless to appoint a commission to
reopen the matter.
Although Mr. Chamberlain's motion
was finnlly adopted, the debata showed
tnat Cecil Rhodes and the British South
African Company, in which he was the
moving spirit, was not without strong
friends in Parliament.
There is no denying the fact that if the
commission attempts to probe too deeply
into the company's affairs persons high in
society and political life would be hurt,
and for that reason 'it is the opinion of
many persons that the proposed investi
gation would prove a farce. It has been
stated that the company, in its lavish use
of money to attain its ends, did not over-
JooK the press, and that its support by
some of the most influential newspapers
of London and elsewhere is due solely to
the tact that these papers were practically
bribed for that purpose.
Mr. Rhodes, who iias come from South
Africa to testify before the commission, is
in fine righting feitie and does not appear
to be the least worried as to the outlook.
His testimony is looked forward to with
much interest, as It is generally believed
that if he should be pressed haru he will
make revelations that will prove a great
shock to what he has termed the "unc
tuous rectitude" of some British states
men.
One of Mr. Chamberlain's objects in in
nsting upon the inquiry is to clear him
6i!lf oi the charge that tie had knowledge
previous to lhe raid that the attempt was
to be made to violate the termory of the
Transvaal; that tne plan had his tacil
sanction, and thar he expressed his disap
proval only when the expedition gave
promise of failure.
Branches ot the new Riisso-China Bank
have been opened at Shanghai, Hangkow,
Peking and elsewhere in China. Business
ii already diverted to the new institution
from British and German houses, and this
fact, together with Great Britain's exclu
sion irom sharing in the construction of
new railways in China, is regarded as
marking the doom of English commercial
predominance in that country.
Dr. Nansen, the well-known Arctic ex
ulorer, and Mrs. Nansen are expected to
arrive In London on Tuesday next. Dr.
Nansen will be received by delegates from
the Royal Geographical Society, the
Royal Society and other organizations.
His hrsi public appearance will be made at
Albert Hall on February 8. Society here
will mnkea lion of him, and there will be
keen competition to secure bis attendance
at dinners and receptions.
Mrs. Nansen will also find easy entree
into the most exclusive London society.
She is the daughter of the late Professor
Sar?, who was a well-known zoologist.
Tne Queen, having heard of her splendid
voice, has invited her to sing at Windsor
Castle, and tlus fact, apide from the re
flected greatness of her husband, will tend
to make her society much sought for.
It is stated in court circles that the
Queen on the occasion of the sixtieth
uiinivernaryof her ascending the throne
will create her daughtersâ Princess Hel
ena, wife of Prince Christian of Schles
wig-Holstein; Princess Louise, wife of the
Marquis of Lome, and Princess Beatrice,
wile of Prince Henfy of Batten burg-
duchesses in their own right. This will
give the children of Princesses Helena and
Beatrice English instead of Gerniun titles,
a very important consideration in the
minds of the English people. . In the case'
of Princess Louise little importance will
be attached to theriienjty, for the' reason
that upon thetieath ot her father her hus
band wiii become the Duke of Argyle.
The revival of 'political salon receptions
is a feature of the present Londo'n'season.
The Duchess of Devonshire, ' the Mar
chioness of Londonderry, Countess Derby,
Countess Spencer and Lady Tweeumoutti
are already holding* . these receptions,
where, combined with social pleasures,
plans are laid ox discussed for t tie benefit
of one or the other of tne political parties
<"r for the ndva'nce'ment in political life of
p.oteges of the titled Jadies who give
these Junctions. The Marchioness of
â  Salisbury, wife of the Prime Minister', is
at present, recruiting her health at Beau-
Jieu.
It is evident that there will be no com
mutation of the sentence of eight montnÂ«'
imprisonment imposed on Lady bcott for
libeling ber son-in-iaw, Earl Russell.
Earl Cadogan and other of her mends
have sought to obtain her release, but they
have failed to shake the Horn- Secretary s
decision not to -et her at liberty, ller
friends vainly offered to guarantee that
she would never again meddle with ftari
Russell, but the Home Secretary remained
obdurate, and Lady Scott must iay the
full nenalty for her disgraceful cha ores.
The London papers uphold the Home
Secretary and argue that it wou d be
against public policy to either set the
pTi-oner free or make any reduction in her
term of imprisonment. Every accommo
dation is furnished her in the jail, her
room having been specially fitted up for
her by a well-known London firm and her
meal/ beins furnished by an outside
caterer. The only punishment sho under
goes is 'being deprived of her liberty.
The American Society in London will
give a reception at the Hotel Cecil on
Washington's birtnday. Senator Wolcott,
who is visiting Europe in the interest of
bimetallism, has been invited to attend.
Kmbassador and Mri. Bayard are ex
pected to be present. Ti^ere will be few
guests and no speeches.
Sir Julian Paunuefote, the British Era
bassador to the United States, is now 69
years old. He will soon reach the uge
when tbe rule of the diplomatic service
will require nia retiiement.
A. Barclay Walker's new yacht, which
is designed to replace the Ailsa, is neariug
completion on the Clyde. She isexpectea
to prove a much better boat than the
Ailsa, which is now 12 years old.
The successful farce, ''My Friend from
India," written by Harry dv Suchet, a
young American dramatist, is billed for
production at the Garrick Theater imme
diately after the engagement of the Carl
Rosa (ompany, wnicli ends on February
t>. The play lias been revised for the Eng
lish, stage by Justin Huntlry McCarthy,
the husband of Cissie Fitzgerald, and will
probably be produced here under the
name of "Mr. Tweedles." Those who
have read the play predict for it a success
equal to that scored in New York.
Mme. Patti's concerts at Monte Carlo
and Nice have drawn large and fashion
able audiences. It is stated that her voice
is showing marked signs of weakness.
M. Paderewski, the pianist, has recov
ered from his attack of nervous insomnia
and will reappear in London next week.
The Dillon iaction of the lii^h party are
understood to be afflicted with ?uch a
want of funds as may prevent them keep
ing their full strength in the House
throughout tue session. No contributions
of any consequence come now from
America.
The famine in India spreads in area and
increases in intensity. The famine fund
fails 10 mount up so mpidly as to warrant
the sanguine estimate that a total of
Â£1 000,000 would be reached. Thoroughly
reliable and independent Indian' advices
concur in stating that relief will be re
quired for about 3,500,000 of v>eopie before
the famine abates, the period of relief ex
tending to September next. No one at
tempts to predict what will happen if the
favorable rains fail to come to India dur
ing July and August.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 31, 1897.
IN THE REALM
OF THE KAISER
Importance Attached to the
Arrival of a Russian
Embassadcr.
Prominent Officials Mentioned in
Connecticn With Recent
' candals.
M. H. de Young Leaves His Family
in Berlin, but Hopes to Return
Officially.
BERLIN. Germany, Jan. 30.â The Em
peror, desiring to be present at the chris
tening of the new born to his brother,
Princa Henry of Prussia, at Kiel, left to
Chancellor Hohenlohe the duty of receiv
ing Count Muravieff, the new Russian
Foreign Minister, who has arr ye t here
from Paris. Tie Chancellor will entertain
Count Muravieff at a banquet to-morrow,
and the Kaiser, who will return to Berlin
from Kiel to-morrow, will receive him to
morrow evening or early Monday morn
in?.
Upon his arrival here to-day Count
Muravieff offered to go to Kiel at once, in
order to have an audience ttiere, but the
Emreror. upon being apprised of the de
sire of the Russian Foreign Minister, sent
a telecrnm saying that it was his intention
to return to Berlin at once and see the
visitor in conjunction with Prince Hohen
lohe. The importance of Count Mura
vieff's visit is not overrated here, as it was
upon the occasion of his arrival in Paris
wnere the exultations of the press and in
official circles were somewhat farcical,
inasmuch as his 'visit was merely an act
of courtesy.
It is also felt here that the shortness of
the Minister's? stay in Paris disposes of the
idea tnat any change in the relations be
tween France and Russia under the pres
ent entente were discussed. Count Mura
vieff got two informal luncheons and one
dinner at Paris, and made at the latter a
nice little speech in which he alluded to
M. Hanotaux, the French Minister of
Foreign Affairs as his dear colleague and
then came away. Nobody here regards
the meeting of Count Muravieff with
President Faure and M. Hanotaux with
any significance, but in any event the
Emperor and Prince Hohenlohe will have
the last word with him.
Just now political and social circles in
Berlin abound with scandalous rumors in
volving, among other names, those of
General Bron?art yon Schellendorf, for
merly Minister of War, and Herr yon
Koeller, late Prussian Minister of the In
terior. The Emperor gave an audience to
Herr yon Kueller on Thursday and it is
reported that aiterward he received Gen
eral Bronsart yon Schellendorf.
While nothing definite is of course
known as to 'he subject of conversation
between the Emperoi)gand the late War
Minster, it is generally understood that
the conference was in reference to the
coming trial of Major yon Tausch, form
erly of the political police, who is now in
jail awaitine trial for alleged forgery and
perjury in connection with the Lucizow
libe.s and General Bronsart's knowledge
of his practices. It is not known that facts
link the War Department with any of
Tausch's acts, but it is rumored that the
Emperor has ordered an inquiry into that
part of the scandal.
A strong story has been circulated that
Yon Guede, the present director of the
War Ministry, is to be tried by the mili
tary court for the evidence he gave in the
recent trial of Baron Luetzow and his
journalistic associates for libeling Count
yon Eulenburc, Prince Alexander yon
Hohenlohe and Baron Marsciiall yon Bie
berstein, but this story has been absolutely
denied.
Still another rumor has been flying
about that Dr. Lucanus, chief of the Em
peror's Civil Cabinet, had been suspended
Irom office for two months pending an in
quiry into his connection with the doc
iored version of the C*ar's toast upon the
occasion of the Russ'ifcn Emperor's last
visit to Brenlau, but being acquitted of
any connection therewith he was deco
rated with the order of the Back Eagle.
The solution of the charges, or ai least
suspicion against Dr. Lucanus being a
solution solatium, the rumor hardly ap
pears credibb.
In connection with all these rumors
the Vosssiche Zeitung makes the state
ment that the Emperor caused the name
of Count Herbert Bismarck to be stricken
from the list of guests at the recent mar
riage of the daughter of Minister yon
Wedel to Lieutenant Bismarck-Hohlen, a
cousin of Count Herbert, because of his
connection with the Tausch intrigues, but
this story is not believed anywhere.
In November last, Dr. Stoecker, for
merly court chaplain, was fitien GOO marks
for libeling the Rev. Dr. Witte. Dr.
Stoecker appealed irora the judgment of
the court and in his appeal cuarged
Witte with writing a letter and forging
Stoecker's name to it. The trial of the
appeal took place this week and occupied
two days, resulting in a verdict that
Witte was not guilty of the lorgery
charged.
The court then fined Stoecker 400 marks
more. The courtroom was crowded dur
ing the tr al and a host of witnesses were
examined, among them Baron yon Ham
mersiein, the former conservative leader
and editor of the Krouz Zeitung, who is
now undergoing a term of imprisonment
for forgery and embezzlement, and Baron
yon Luetzow and Herr Leckert, who are
also serving sentences for libeling Prince
Hohenlohe and others.
Prince Albrecht of Prussia gave an aud
ience to United States Embassador Uhl
this week.
M. H. de Young of San Francisco, who
has been stivinj: here with his family, has
started lor Washington, leaving his family
in Berlin. It is believed in American cir
cles in this city that he Is going to Canton,
Ohio, to emteavor to secure the appoint
ment as United States Embassador to
Germany.

FAST AND CLEVER
FIGHT TO A DRAW
Jimmy Barry and Sammy
Kelly Are Evenly
Matched.
For Twenty Founds They Punch
Each Other in a Scientific
Manner.
Vicious Swings, Fierce Rallies and a
Copious Flow o! Claret Mark
the Contest.
NEW YORK, N. V. ( Jan. 80.â Jimmy
Barry of Chicago and Sammy Kelly of
New' York boxed a very-fast and scientific
twenty-round draw at the Broadway Ath
letic Club to-ni.'ht. Barry was the aggres
sor after the first round, but was nearly out
with a left swing on the jaw in tne fifth.
He revived wonderfully, however, and
forced thepace after the eighth round..
Kelly showed remarkable cleverness, and
his advantage of height, weight and reach
stood him in good- stead. Barry put up a
great battle and- many of the speotators
thought he had a sjiade the better -of ilie
argudtent, but it was a very even thing
ana the decision was a good one.
The betting was 100 to 80 on Barry. The
opening bout was between Billy O'Don
nell of Memphis and Jack Hannigan of
Pittsburg. They were advertised to go
ten rounds at 122 pounds, but O'Donnell
Biruply punched Hannigan's face into a
mass of bioi. d and had him all but out in
the sixth round, when the referee stopped
the bout in one minute and thirty seconds.
The second pair were "London" .Camp
bell of Philadelphia and Jack Smith of
Norfolk, Vat Campbell got the decision.
There were about 2500 people- present
â when Barry a,nd Kelly got into the ring.
Barry's seconiis.were Joe Ghoynski, George
Dixon and Bob Armstrong. Kelly was
looked after by Larry Burns. Paddy Morati
and Frank Peabouy. Dick Roche was
referee and Jim Lavelle timekeeper. The
fight by rounds: â¢
Barry opened with a left that wrs stopped.
He tried the ritrht and missod, getting a light
right In the body. They mixed it up evenly,
both landing; then Kelly wen-t in and forcei
his man against tlie ropes; putting both bands
on the lace, and Barry clinched. Kelly tried
again and repeated and- for a time it looked as
ii Barry was in trouble.
In the second they exchanged swings and
Barry sent a hard left on the no.se. Kelly shot
his left to the wind, but Bany retaliated with
' one on the neck.
Barry opened the third, with a left on the
mouth* and followed it up with a right on
tne body, which, he repeated. Kelly rushed,
but was countered .hur'd on- the wind. Both
landed lefts on the face. .Kelly rushed and
missed, Barry putting a left en the neck.
Barry came la with a hard right on the jaw,
and before the round closed sent right ana left
to the body and face. It was Barry's round.
Both were a bit wild in the fourth. Hurry
lauded a oorklng left swing on the jaw, but
Kel.y evened up \vith a hard one on tne body.
Ih the tifth Kelly' landed a terrible left
swing ou the jaw that sent ' Barry down, and
the Chicago boy took nine seconds to gÂ»-t up.
Kelly rushed at him, but though very tired he
managed to stay.
Barry came up strong for the sixth and gent
in three blows on thef head without a return.
Kelly landed hard on ihe wind, but Jimmy
countered on the neck. Kelly sent another
left to the jaw that gent Barry's head back,
but tlie little fellow sent his right to the nose
mid Kelly's blood commenced to fly. Twice
before the bell rang Jimmy sent the left to the
sore nose and mouth..
Barry showed, some of his old-time clever
ness and hitting power ih the seventh, and
punished Kelly badly in liie face. 'Kelly ap
peared a little" weak, bu-t put pne hard pwing
on the wind. Barry was guarding his jaw
carefully.
The aiglith was about even, and toward the
close both were sparring lor wind.
Each was stagpered with rights on the wind
In the opening.of the ninth. Barry tnea sent
his right to the ribs and left to the jaw, but
Kelly came back hard on the wind.-
Barry made the damaged, nose bleed again
In the" tenth, but a smart upper-cut on the
mouth drew Barry's claret. It was an even
thing so fur.
Kelly had a hit the best of ihe eleventh, but
Barry showed great cleverness.
Kelly sent his right to the jiw a couple of
times in the twelfth and Barry was beginning
to appear.tir.jd. as- the' weight was telling on
him. . â¢
Barry came up refreshed by good handling
for the thirteenth and landed right and left
four times on Kelly's jaw.
Barry aest his man to the ropes with a left
on the jaw In the opening of. the fourteenth
ena followed it up with two great rightÃ and a
left. Then he f.rced Kelly all around the I
ring, raining left swings on the face and body.
Kelly was very tired and was strictly on trie
defensive when the bell rang. '
Both were tired lor the fifteenth. Just as
the bell rang Kelly landed a left on the face.
Kelly countered har>l on the jaw once In tne.
6lxteen:h, but Barry had a'bit tuc best of the
round.
Barry had Kelly on tlie run at the end of the
seventeenth round, but Kelly aid some ciever
yorK at'tne start.
Both exchanged hard lefts on the tine and
tody in the eighteenth, but a straight left on
the mouth at the end drew the blood afresh
from Kelly.
Kelly left an opening m the nineteenth
which Barry was quick to take advantage of,
and ho sent in a voiiey of richts-and lefts be
fore Kelly recovered: Barry ' had clearly the
best of all tbe exchanges that followed.
Barry sent his mail halfway to the floor
with a jab on the tttroat in-the twentieth, and
some hot rallies followed, which were fairly
even up.

before 7 o'clock this evening three masked
men entered the Catholic bookstore of
John A. Heilman, corner of Eleventh;

church fixtures and $60 in cash.
The store is within half a block of one
of the busiest streets in the city, and many
people were passing the door at the time.
Heilman was at work on his cashbook
when the men entered, a-nd as he looked
up he g;:zed into three murderous-looking
revolvers. He was told to keep quiet,
and, while one of them. guarded him, the
others took the content^ of the safe and
placed them in a valise which they had
with them. They then cut the telephone
â wire and backed out, locking the door,
thinking to mate Heflman a prisoner.
He got out, however, and gave the alarm
to the insurance patrol in the rear of the
store, but the robbers had escaped*

SONG BIRDS OF MILL VALLEY.
Large Number of Imported Singers to Be
Given Their Liberty in Marin
County.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., Jan. 30.â 1t will
be pleasing information to the lovers of
birds to know that the attempt of the citi
zens of Mill Valley in raising and import
ing feathered songsters hss met -with
greater success than the projectors of the
enterprise expected. Anton MichÂ«litschke,
the secretary of the Society for the Accli
mation and Protection of Singing Birds of
Mill Valley, has just filed a report of the
work accomplished by the organization
since its inception.
The birds now confined in a large aviary
on the Barkan property in Mill Valley
will be given their liberty on the 15th of
February. Since their arrival in Mill
Valley only six have died.. One thrush
and two finches died the first week, hav
ing b-en unable to stand the long trip
from Europe. The same number and kind
were killed t'y sparro&hawks, who made
violent attacks upon tt>e birds in the avi
ary, compelling ihe society to erect extra
nets as safeguards.
The birds have found Mill Vnllev cli
mate suitable, and the .skylarks which
were released last September are fre
quently seen flying overhead. They are
also increasing in number, and the mem
bers of the bird society are Ravine small
houses built in ,the trees on their prop
erty, where the imported songsters can"
live and find protection from the bluejays
and sparrow-hawk". Mr. Michalitscbks
in his report advises the society to in
crease the bounty paid for the scalps of
bluejays killed in Mill Valley.
The birds which will be released in Feb
ruary are of different varieties â gold
finches, thrushes, skylarks and chaffinches
being the most prominent. The success
which has crowned the work of the so
ciety has encouraged the members to
make arrangements for the importation
of another large consignment of the
feathered beauties in the fall. In the mean
time the slaughter of sparrow-hawks,
bluejays and other obnoxious Lirds will
be prosecuted unmercifully.

town a few years ago, has been revived,
and is planning some valuable work. The

POINT LAMA`S SCHOOL OF MYSTERY
Theosophists to Establish a College
Where (he Science of the Soul
Will Be Taught.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. SO.â The rea
sons for the purchase of 132 acres of land
nuar Point Loma, San Diego, by G. A.
Griscom of New York, was explained here
to-day Dy Abbott Ciart, lecturer for the
Theosophical Society of Southern Califor
nia.
Gnscom is vice-president and manager
of the International Steamship line and is
now on his way to Japan, and it has been
thought that this purchase bore an im
portant relation to the proposed steam
ship line from San Diego to the Mikado's
kingdom. Theosopbist Clark says not.
"The purchase," Baid Mr. Clark this
morning, "is made for the purpose of
eÃtablfshing on Point Lorn a a school for
the revival of the lost mysteries of an
tiquity.
"We have for a long time suspected
that Southern California would be se
lected for the site of such an institution,
but nothing was said until the purchase
had been actually consummated.
"Tnis is no visionary scheme, as the
names of the men identified with it will
signify. E. B. Rambo, who paid $25,000
down for tne site in behalf of the society,
is the wholesale agent for the Winchester
Arms Company in San Francisco.
"With him ia associated Dr. J. D. Buck
of Cincinnati, one of the leading homeo
pathic physicians of the country. A. E.
Neresheimer, the vice-president of the so
ciety, is a wholesale diamond merchant of
New York.
"The institution will be on the lines oi
the schools in which Piato, Pythagoras,
Solon and Euclid studied. Its first effect
will be on the intellect and next on the
usefulness of man.
"The unknown laws of nature will be
probed and the science of the soul will>e
taught. The college will be open to Chris
tian, Hindoo, Buddhist or man of any
other creed."
HARBOR BOARD'S INVESTIGATION.
Soundings Off Santa Monica and in the
Outer Harbor at San Pedro
Comp feted.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 30.âSound
ings off Santa Monica and in the outer
harbor site at San Pearo have been com
pleted as far as directed by the Harbor
Board. The United States steamer Ged
ney, the vessel used by the engineers, is
now moored in the inner hnrbor, and the
results of the soundings are being platted.
The work of platting consists of locating
the various soundings on a map or chart
for ready reference. This is done with
data obtained from rough notes made
when the soundings were in progress. The
lines of the soundings are at distances of
about one-eighth of a mile apart.
Soundings along these lines were made
at long or short intervals, according to
the depth of water. At greater depths
they were made further apart. As the"
soundings were made to ascertain the
depth of the water from its surface to the
bottom, pains were taken not to permit
the lead to sink into the mud at any place.
The results' would not, therefore, show
the character of the bottom.
The results of the soundingp show com
paratively little change from the measure
ments recorded after ihe lasteurvey.
The principal differences noted are in
the outer harbor site in San Pedro, near
the mouth of the inner harbor, the Gov
ernment jetty having produced a material
change. Signals have been posted along
the sides of the inner harbor and sound
ings are to be made in it. They will prob
ably be closer together than those in the
outer harbor bite.

OLYMPIA, Wash., Jan. 30.â The in

FRESNO FORGERY CASE.
Shenff Scott Tells of the Futile Search
for William Wootton, the Missing
Rancher.
, FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 30.â The most im
portant witness in the Sanders trial to
day was Sheriff Jay Scott, who testified
that he had made a thorough search for
Wootton in the southern part of the State,
whence came letters purporting to have
been signed by the rancher to various per
sons in this county.
Not a trace of the missing rancher could
he find. No one had seen Wootton in
the cities where the letters had been
mailed. No one could be found who had
seen John Knausch or R. L Graves,
the two capitalists of whom Sanders
tells.
Attorney S ort resumed the cross-ex
amination of George Wiseman when court
convened in the morning.
"I have bad news for you," the witness
had said to Sanders. "Uncle Billy (vVoot
ton) is sick."
Sanders had then replied, hanging his
head sadly: '
"Well, it can't In helped."
"What do you think of him?" the wit
ness had bsked his son, who was standing
near. He referred to Sanders.
"Give him rope enough and he'll hang
himself," was the young man's reply.
Attorney Short quickly moved mat this
testimony of the witness be stricken out,
and the court so ordered.
Prior Nance and wife testified that they
lived in Hills Valley, and from their place
led the trail across the mountain to
Wootton's house. It was over tnis trail
that, Sandtrs says, Knausch a:;d Graves
walked with their bae of $20,000 irt gold,
when they came to Wootton's place and
bonght the ranch from him.
. Nance and his wife both swore that they
were positive that no -one had gone over
the trail that day. '
Sheriff Scott then told the story in de
tail of his futile sean-h for Wootton,
Knausch and Graves throughout South
ern California.
SWINDLERS AT STOCKTON.
Two Suave Strangers Induce a Bank Clerk
io Loan Them Several Hundred
\ Dollars.
STOCKTON, Cat;. Jan. 30. â Several
weeks ago two well-dressed young
strangers dropped into Stockton and put
up at the leading hotel. They seeruea to
have plemy of means and said that they
proposed to engage in manufacturing here.
So plausiDie were they that they induced
the owner of the premises at the corner of
Washington and California streets in this
city to eject a tenant in order to give them
the building in which to store the mach
ines with which, they said, they proposed
to establish a shirt factory.
Shortly after their arrival they went to
a brokerand said that they needed more
moDey in order to bring an additional lot
of machinery from San Francisco.
Fred Buttrick, a clerk of the Stockton
Savings Bank, advanced them $450, tak
inc the sewing machines as security.
Since then nothing has been seen of the
young men who were to engage in the
manufacturing business here, and Buttrick
has been nursing his wrath.
To-day me aeent who negotiated the
loan took the machines off the bank
clerk's hands, not wishing to be a party
to any fraud. Buttrick, however, is still
looking for the alleged manufacturers,
and, if they return to Stockton, has sev
eral things to say to them.
PORTLAND'S FEMALE BURGLAR.
Taught Stenography to a Fashionablt
Class by Day and Stole
at Night.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 30. â0n the
night of January 26, between 10 and 11
o'clock, the show window of the pawn
brosing establishment of L. A. Meyers on
First street, between Morrison and Yam
hill, was robbed of a mandolin, three um
brellas and a quantity of jewelry.
This crime was considered an extraordi
nary one, because of the store's promi
nent location, the early houi and thÂ«
time'required to cut out the glass pane.
When the robbery was reported at police
headquarters Detectives Welsh and Sim
mons were put on the trail. Early this
morning they got a tracer, on the strength
of whicn they visited .the home of Mrs.
Edith A. Brown at Irvinfiton, where, after
a short colloquy, Mrs. Brown surrendered
nearly all the property stolen from Meyers.
Mrs. Brown was taken by the detectives to
the Central Police S;ation, where she con
fessed to having done tha work single
banded.
Mrs. Brown is about 35 years old. Ten
or twelve year 3 ago she married a well
known Southern Pacfic train dispatcher
named DuVlley, from whom she has been
separated for some years. Of laic she has
been teaching stenography and typewrit
ing In the Hamilton building, with a fash
ionable ciass.
A little more than a year ago Detective
Welsh arrested this woman for larceny in
the rooms of Mrs. Biver, in the Hamilton
building, but as she made restitution and
begged for her reputation that charge
against her was not pressed.

FIEND CAPTURED
Caueht Hurrying From the
Scene of His Third
Conflagration.
Five Warehouses and Contents
Valued at $4%000 Lost in
Fiames.
Ihz Incendiary an Imbcile Intent
on Destroying the Entire
Tcwa.
PETALTJMA, Cal.. Jan. 30 -Whitney's
big warehouses were discovered to be
oblaze at an early hour this morning, and
about the same lime lire broke out in the
engine-room of the Peialuma Wooien-
Milla in East Petalunia. Fire was also
discovered under the drawbridge over
Petaluma Creek. The bridge and the
woolen-mills were snvei by prompt ac
tion, but the warehouses, rive in number,
and said to be the largest structures in the
county, were entirely destroyed. Filled
with "hay, as they were, nothing could
ye saveii them. The fire illumined tbe
j ntry for miles and attracted to the
* :f> â¢& multitude of excited people, who,
. upon hearing tlie alarm from tne woolen
mills became almost panic-stricken.
Thegreate&t alarm has been felt in tb.e
city for some time past, especially since
the fire in John Cavanagh's lumber-yard
and the attempt to burn the bridge on the
evening of Wednesday last. All sorts of
rumors have been in the air, and â so
thorough iy alarmed .had the people grown
that to-night a regiment- of watchmen
has been employed by private citizens to
look after their property, and the ci t.izens
themselves and even the regular night
patrol are being hourly he.ld up by the
newly engaged amateur squad.
This city is visited every, winter by
something more than its quota of tramps,
who find a rendezvous/on the outskirts
of the town at a place known as the
Willows.
Thy have always heretofore behaved
much above the average . manner' of
tramps, but as the fires have been un
questionably of incendiary origin the
thoughts of the pÂ£6p!e immediately
turned toward the Willows, and it was
feared that a plan bad. be*n laid there for
the destruction and the looting of. the city
by the lighting of fires' in different and
distant, places at the same' time, so as to
prevent the concerted working of the
firemen.
But to-night, while the sky is still
lighted by the smoldering fire of the big
warehouses, and the watchmen on dar-k
--streets are striking terror to the hearts of
timid citizens as well as to each other by
the exhibition of their own zeal, the cause
of the alarm as weJl as of the loss of some
$40,000 worth of properly is pounu"ing the
iron doors of the County Prison, calling j
duwn all manner of 'harm' upon thehead I
I of Marshal Collins, who arrested him this
..-a.-.
: -'online Benedetto is *m Italian who has i
Keen under suspicion of the Marshal for
some months as a vaerant. He is rather
an unfortunate. He was' a laborer em
ployed on the railroad section during the
early part of last year and wrtrk-ed steadily
enough. Last summer he suffered a sun
stroke and since his recovery he has done
almost no work and as a consequence has
Jived almost nowhere. 'He has become a
familiar figure to those whose duties keep
them abroad between- sundown and sunu
p. Two engines stand in the- railroad
yard-i during the early hours' of tne morn
ing, w''th lire up.to be ready for duty, and
he has been aqcustomed to climbing into
them ,to get warni when no better shelter
offered.
Mr. Mego", the bridge-tender, also an
Italian,, gave him' a place to sleep for
several niahte, but was finally compelled
to e\] him to find new quarters.
Beforahis misfortune and while he was
regularly employed, Benedetto wrote to
his wife in Italy tp come to him with their
three c-hiidreri. She refused to do so, and
iLis S'-iimed to prey upon him. "
About midnight last night Benedetto
was seen about the railroad yards as
.usual, and when Mego at 5:45 o'clock was
crossing the bridge" he saw Benedetio
going in the opposite direction. Mego
speke to him, but the man in the dark
swerved off to the otner side. As Mego
passed the big warehouse a few minutes
Later he saw tbat the door was slightly
open. He looked in and saw a furnace of
fire.
â  His larynx is strained out of all possible
Â use for weeks to come because of the way
he yelled. Henry Myers, who was groom- |
ing his, horses in Poehlman's stable a \
b.ock away, heard the cry, saw the flames j
' ana kept his head sufficiently to turn in
,"' the alarm properly, and in a very few min
utes the firemen were at work.
Their entire attention was directed to
ward con fininsr the fire to the big ware
houses, for they weie already doomed.
This was a big enoueh job for the depart
ment, but they did it well in spite of the
iact that several of the near-by buildings
i caught fire. Over 2000 tons of hay and
/ straw were housed in the frame building,
I and while the rlamea that were eating it
\up with tremendous relish, with a roar
that could be heard a half mile away, and
a tongue that seemed to be leaping up to
lick the stars, had awakened the city and
drawn its people toward them another
alarm was struct. It was for the fire that
Benedetto had started in the engine-bouse
of the woolen-mills across '.he creek.
The excitement that aiready swayed the
people was ot course intensified. Chief
Myers sent hose comDany 2 to the place,
and it arrived in time to aid the early
millmenin extinguishing- the flames they
ha i discovered. The mill is an immense

Little damage was done by the tire, but

would undoubtedly have been wholly de
stroyed, with there is no telling what
â¢ other property.
. , The department fought the flames at the
warehouses until o o'clock, when they had
â¢ sufficiently euosided to leave the surround
ings reasonably â  safe, and one hose com
. pany was alone left on guard. The lire is
to-night still limiting the sky.
Marshal Collins began an immediate
â  searclwor the incendiary, who nad by all
these indications left no doubt of his pres
â¢ ence in the city. Some 'â¢light suspicion
. was directed toward Benedetto, although
â¢â¢. he was generally looked vi.on as an inof
â  f&rwsive fellow. " Tiie Marshal found him
in a saloon in East Petaluma about 10
â¢ o'clock this mornin* sitting before a stove
drying his socks. One of bis shoes was
,; taken and .found to fit exactly into the
| print of a shoe thai Dad run through the

I rint of a shoe that had run through the
â  i ward the woolen-mill just before
I the fire was discovered.
\ ' Ho was arrested and charged with the
crime. H â  denied it atoutly. Mecoa-ked
him in his own language at the Marshal's
rf-qtifst why he did not reply when he
(MÂ«go) sr>oke to bin) on the bridge just
before the big fire was discovered. At this
. Jie broke down and confessed.
He became defiant at once. He said it
was he who set lire to Cavanagh's lumber
on Wednesday night. There was a quan
tity'of huy" there and he had touched a
match to Itâ that was all. He had taketi
some of the hay and placad it under the
bridge and touched a light to 'hat also,
th<! same night, while the firemen were a',
work in the lumber-yard. Last night, lie
said, he had better success He had iaKen
a quantity of the oily waste used in c.e^in
ilin the engines in the yard and placed it
on tne stringers unde.- the bridge, j. c
had then gone to the warehouse, effected
an entrance and had touched a matcU to
the hay in the center of the main aisle.
He returned to the bridge and struct a
light there. ' Tuen he crossed, m <- et)n S
Mego, the bridge-tender, who had be
friended him, as h- ran.
He went straight to the woolen-mill,
and there, placing some scantling on end.
be put some of the waste under it and
liphteJ Ins third fire. The fire at the
britl'-e went out of itself after burning
through one of the cross timbers, and was
discovered only after he hiid told about it.
Benedetto was placed in a cell at the
City Prison and left to himself lor some
time. This eveninc, when Marshal Col
lins went to look in upon him, the man
h;:d torn the blankets of his led ana
broken the tin vessels of his cell ami
thrown tuem out through the bars, and
over the ruins bad scattered the remains
of the photographs of his four children
that he had torn into sm lil i>iece=. He
saiil he â¢had done with tru-m all. He was
standing bareiooted and half-dressed in
his cell.
The Marshal put him into another cell,
without bars, wnere he could not throw
:i\vay his Uedcloilinig. The lellow made
a desperate light, it n-quiring several men
to overcome him. The man is doubtless
if. sane.
His description of his preparations un
der the bridge and at the woolen-mill
tallied so well with the facts known as to
leave no doubt that he is the tirebug, and
that he was alone in his operations. The
Murshal is certain that the cause for alarm
has been removed in his arrest.
The Whitney warehouses consisted of a
cluster of five building, occupying nearly
the whole block bounded by C, D and
First streets on the north, south and west
and the river on the east. They were 206
by 126 feet in dimensions, and were built
ovi r a scnre of years ago by the Lite Al
bion P. Whitney, being still owned by his
I estate.
There were nearly 3000 tons of hay in
the building, according to Superintendent
.Fred Walker, besides tackle, furniture,
implements anil merchandise. Ten of
j Captain Walker's famous flock of Maltese
I cats were burned.
The totallossis estimated at $40,000, the
pr.ncipal losers being asfollows: Whitney
estate, ouiiding, $cOjO, partially insured;
A. Kann. hay and merchandise, $5000, in

$.500, not insured. The remainder of the
losses range from $20 to $200, being sus
tained by merchants and farmers who had
small quantities of hÂ«y in storage.
Risk Bros, had 60J tons of hay in the
wooden warehouse across the street, but
this, witn Ka 's grain warehouse adjoin

CHEAP DRUGS FOR SAN JOSEANS.
I Secret Societies Will Open a Co-Operative
Store and Announce a Cut on
Rates.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. Jan. 30.â The drug
; gists of this city have been dragged into
the war that has waged for some time be
tween the physicians of the county and a
number of the secret societies, and steps
have been taken by a number of the
lodges to establish a co-operative drug
store.
The trouble originated a couple of
months ago w len the Santa Ciara County
Medical Society passed a resolution bind
ing its members not to act as physicians
for societies for iess than the regular rate
charged by the profession. This aroused
the ire of .several organizations and the
Sons of St. George and the Foresters in
duced Dr. George Owen Willis of Grass
Valley.to come to San Jose and elected
him their physician.
Tne medicos passed resolutions ngreeing
not to associate with or aid Dr.. Willis in
any manner. A petition was circulated
among the druggists asking them to re
fuse to compound Dr. Willis* prescrip
tions, and all Ihe drugstores, with the ex
ception of one, entered into the compact.
The lodges mentioned have now engaged
a druggist and wilt shortly open a store to
dispense drugs to the various fraternal
societies and tbe trade generally. They
also propose to make a big cut in all kinds
of drugs and proprietary articles.
STOLEN SILVERWARE RECOVERED
Detee'ire Jjoeatea Property Taken From
th* Spencer Jir*fdenc.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Jan. 30. -Detective
Anderson to-day recovered several pieces
of si.verware in Sixth-street Chinatown
that were stolen from the residence of
Judge F. E. Spencer nearly two years ago,
at which time the house was set on fire to
hide the theft. At the time of thÂ» robbery
?3000 worth of diamonds and $700 worth
of silverware were taken, but no i art of
the loot was recovered until to-day.
Among the pieces lound was a silver shav
ing-mug marked with the letter "S." Dâ 
teetive Anderson is confident of being
able to locate more of the silverware and
part of the diamonds.
Shortly before the fire was discovered
on the evening of the robbery, Ah Wone,
the Chinese cock, was seen hastening
toward Chinatown with a large bundle
under h s arm. He was arrested on
charges of robbery and arson, but the
evidence was sligtu and tlie jury dis
agreed. Charges of being unlawfully in
this country were then preferred, and he
was deported. Wong evidently had the
stuff cached, and the hiding place was
confided to a confederate.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 31, 1897.
OUTLAW TAYLOR
NEATLY TRAPPED
The Murderer of the Meeks
Family Taken Near
Hanford.
Surprised and Overpowered at
a Sheep Camp Where He
Was Employed.
Had Escaped From a Missouri Prison
When Under Sentence of
Death.
HAN FORD, Cal., Jan. 30.â George
Taylor, the man who is wanted for the
murder of the Meeks family near Brown
ing, Mo., in May, 1894, was captured at
this point yesterday by W. V. Buckner,
Sheriff of Kings County, and his deputies,
Andrew Ayres and Howard MeGinnis.
B. F. Lane, a painter by trade, who ar
rived twelve months aco from tbe town
where the murder was committed and
who had known the whole Taylor family
from boyhood first sighted Taylor, alias
"Rattlesnake Bill," yesterday afternoon.
Lane states that he believes Taylor recog
nized him, but he pave no sien of recog
nition that would put the outlaw on hiÂ«
guard. Lane went immediately to Sheriff
Buckner, who caused a search to bo made.
The only fact he could elicit was that Tay
lor had made inquiries for the Jacobs
ranch. Telet>hone communication was
had with the foreman of the ranch, who
was instructed to keep a sharp lookout for
tbe suspect.
On Friday morning a message was re
ceived from tlie foreman, stating that the
man described had been there at 11
o'clock, but that he had been dispatched
to a sheep camp some eight miles away,
where work was given him. Plans were
made for his capture at supper-tim?. One
of the blacksmiths employed on tne ranch
vras sent ahead to recor.noiter. He was in
structed to wave a lighted lamp about the
cookhouse if Taylor was there. The
blacksmith found Taylor at supper, and
upon the signal being given the officers
rushed in and took him as he stood in his
shirtsleeves in front of the camptire.
Taylor was unarmed and made no re
sistance. His capture was a clever com
bination of detective work and disguises,
Lane, the man who claimed to have
known him from boyhood, having changed
his appearance and visited the sheep
camp to see if the man whom it was pro
posed to arrest really was Taylor.
Taylor refused to answered any ques
tions vut to bim by reporters. He is in a
ragged condition, but still has not the ap
pearance of a tramp exposed to wind and
weather. A bey who was with him, and
who is held for what he may know, states
that be and Taylor came down from Ore
gon recently.
CRIME OF THE TAYLORS.
George Steeki, Hi* t'ifti and Two Chil
dren Put to Heath. . -
KANSAS CITY, Mo Jan. 30.â 1n May,
1894, the Meeks family, consisting of
(ieorge Meeks, bis wife and three children,
started to drive from their home, near
Browning, Mo., to Oklahoma. Meeks was
a witness against William and George
Taylor, who had been charged with steal
ing cattle and whose trial was to com
mence the wees following.
On the morning after the family left
home little Nellie Meeks, aged 6 years,
aroused a farmer near Browning and told
him that her father, mother and others of
the family had been Killed and that their
bodies were in a slrawstack in a field. She
herseli was wounded in the bead. She
said the Taylor brothers had killed them.
The two brothers on learning of the
finding of the bodies fled from the neigh
borhood. They were afterward arrested
in Arkansas and voluntarily returned to
Missouri.
They were tried and convicted on tbe
testimony of little Nellie and sentenced
to be hanged. They had been wealthy,
and every effort that money could bring
to bear to save them from the gallows
was without avail.
On the nigbt of April 11 last George es
caped from the jail at Carrollton, Mo.,
where he was confined, together with his
brother William. The latter also got out
of prison, but was recaptured and hanged
in Carrollton ou April 30.
A number of reports have been sent out
over the country that George was at the
heaa of an outlaw band in Oklahoma, and
others that he had been seen in Nebraska.
RIGHTS OF WATER COMPANIES.
Judge Torrance of San Diego Submits an
Opinion Bearing Upon H/a
Recent Ruling.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. 30.â Judge E.
S. Torrance of the Superior Court this
afternoon rendered a written opinion in
the case of El a B Ward vs. the San Diego
Land and Town Company, upon which
was based bis decision of January 16 over
ruling tne demurrer of the defendant to
the plaintiff's amended comilaint. The
decision was directly opposed to that of
United States District Judge Ross of some
months previous.
It holds that the company had no legal
right to double water rates, as alleged in
the complaint, and holding that the com
pany had the right to make specific con
tracts with consumers for water rental
for any length of time, regardless of
whether the Supervisors had previdusly
fixed the rates or not.
The present opinion is considered of far
reaching importance, as it goes into the
details ot the irrigation question as no
previous opinion uas done. It recites
that in 1887 Ward purchased from the
company live acres of land for $1500.
The company, by writteu and printed
documents, had aiways advertised the
lands as irrigat' d to January, 1896, aiut
that the annual charge for water rental
was $3 50 per acre and no more. Bath
representations were made as induce
ments to prospective buyers.
In lftÂ»8 and until January 1, 1896. the
company assessed and collected bui $3 50
an acre rental. On that date it issued a
circular in which it raised the rate to $7
an acre. The plaint. ff determined to
make a test case and accordingly tendered
the old rental as usual.
Tne com plaint declares that the shut
ting off of water, which the defendant
threatens, will cause preat loss and irre
parable injury, and prays to have the de
fendant enjoined from dLoing so and to
have the delendant's claim tor increased
rental declared void.
The opinion declares that the decision
hinges on whether ihe defendant has the
right to increase water rates heretofore
char ed, and this rests upon the proper
construction of tbÂ« powers and duties of a
water corporation under the constitu
tional laws; of ihe Slate.
The defendant claimed that in the ab
sence ot fixed rates made by Supervisors
it has the lejrai riaht to charge and collect
rates as it deems proper and to increase
them whenever the business requires it,
and also that the company, being a s quasi
public institution, it would be against
public policy to hold it so bound to
previous contracts as to preclude it Irom
exercising its luw-^iven right. â¢
The opinion says this new and startling
doctrine was not until recently supposed
to be embodied in the law which governs
the rights of persons carrying and distrib
uting water. It is certain that the
intent of the act of 1885 was to
have a certainty about water rates and
that there should be some permanency as
to the period during which rates once es
tablished should continue to be collected.
The statute nivea the water corporations
no right io change rates once estab
lished and collected, and the constitu
tion prohibits the ri^ht to collect rates
except by authority of and in the manner
prescribed by the law, and the statute
provides that when rates once established
by the Supervisors have been abrogated
by the board, the actual rates established
and cohected by the company shall be
deemed legalij' established rates.

OREGON BANDITS
ELUDE PURSUERS
Railroad Detectives Find
No Trace of the Train
Robbars.
Confident That Case and the
Pool Brothers Are the
Cuiprits.
Mountain Fastnesses to Bs Thoroughly
Searched by a Corps of
Officers.
PORTLAN D, Or.. Jan. 30.â The out
laws who boarded the Shasta express
near Roseburg Thursday night and
wrecked the express-car with dynamite
after slightly wounding Engineer Morris
with a bullet are still at large. Division
Superintendent Fields of the Southern
Pacific Company arrived from the scene
of the robbery this evening and says that
thus far no positive clew establishing the
identity of the bandits Has been found.
Both the railroad company and 'Wells-
Fargo have detectives at Roseburg, and
posses of officers and armed citizens are
ttill searching every fastness and hiding
place for miles around In the hope of dis
covering trace of the robbers.
Wells â¢ Fargo Detectives Hume and
Thacker are directing the posses. Several
moro detectives will arrive from Sacra
mento in the morning to join the force.
Ex-Sheriff Cathcart of Douglas County is
positive that John Case and the Pool
brothers were the ones who robbed the
train. He arrested them and secured
their conviction about two years ago for
train robbery, but they escaped on a tech
nicality and were lately seen in the moun
tain fastnesses near the scene of the recent
hold-up, near which occurred also the
robbery for which thÂ«Â«y were convicted.
They are desperate men, and knowing
that a second trial for this offense means,
in all probability, life sentences, will tight
to the death to prevent being taken. To
morrow a party of officers will leave for
the mountain stamping ground and con
duct a thorough searcn.
It is the generally accepted opinion that
the outlaws escaped in a rowboat from the
wrecked train, and thus left no trail be
hind. They could hare dropped down the
river to Roseburg after secretine their
plunder, and there mingled with the
crowds attracted to the streets by the re
ports of the dynamite exploded in the ex
press-car. ,
Five men were seen approaching the
river just below the bridge near which the
train was stopped. Two of these uiigbt
have been confederates, who kept in the
background and bad everything in readi
ness for thtir escape.
The Dig safe, which was badly warped
by the tire in the express-car, has not yet
been opened, so the extent of the loss oc
casioned by the overheating of the safe
cannot be determined.

The Storm of Thursday Night
One of the Heaviest
fcr Years.
How the Stanch P.io'-Boat America
Rode Oat the Gale South <f
the Faralloa-'s.
Hopes that the Swanhilda, bearing
Murderer Butler to the c.utches of the
waiting officers of tlie law, will soon be in
port huve been raised by the. southeast
gales that have prevailed during tlie past
few days. The pilots and shipping men
i:e:ierally know that these winds are
favorable to ships coming from Australia,
and they look for the bie four-master any
day now, particularly as the rear guard of
the fleet from Newcastle is beginning to
Btragele in.
Tne arrival of the British ship King
Edward off Point Reyes last evening was
looked upon as a good sign, though she is
seventy-five days out from Newcastle.
Trie storm .of Thursday night was re
garded by the pilots, the best judge 3of
the severity of ga.es, as the fiercest that
has visited this coast in many years. 'lue
handsome pilot schooir r America caught
the full force o* the storm while lying
eoutheastof the Farallones, and for several
hours tlie crew and cruising captain,
Pilot Fred Jordan, worked incessantly to
prevent her from beini; injured by the
fury of the raging wind and waves.
The first big squall came from the south
east with a roar, carrying the crests of the
â waves into spray and dashing over the
bow and sides of the smart schooner.
In a moment the crew was called from
below and during a momentary lull the
mainsail, which had been reefed, was stiil
further shortened, the foresail hauled
down and the jib reduced to a storm size.
Hardly had the preparations for a b. d
night been completed when the wind came
on with renewed violence and for a time
ihe stanch craft was buried in foam.
Squall after squall strucK her with a
roar that sounded like a passing railroad
train and the stout rigging sang with the
force of the gale. It was almost impossi
ble to breathe when lacing the wind and
all hands were kept on deck all night to
be ready ior an emergency.
So great was ihe force of the etorm that
the vessel, under her short canvas, could
not hold her own, and during tlie few
hours that the storm lasted drifted many
miles to leeward. Luckily Pilot Jordan,
who is considered one of i lie best naviga
tors on ihe coast, had worked we.l to sea
when the "dirty" sky presaged a storm,
and there was plenty of sea room for the
schooner to r*r f. through before the gale
broke and showed the vessel to be safe.
Her position was figured by the pilot
several times during 'he night, the lead
in each instance } roving that his calcula
tions were correct.
Detective McHattie, while on his way
here from Australia, set several traps for
Butler, the murderer, in case that no
torious character should leave the Swan
hilda en rf ute. At the Fiji Islands ho
left photographs of Butler, a complete
statement of the charges against him and
a request with the Sheriff to arrest and
hold the man on sight.
He also took similar precautions at
Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, and at Seat
tle, Wash. So if Butier lands at any of
these places he will be apprehended, as
the authorities are on the lookout for him.
All the pilots on ihe pilot-boats that lie
off shore awaiting incoming vessels have
authority now from the United States
Marsha! 10 place Butler In irons should
they board the Swanhilda and find him.
They not only have authority from the
Government officers, but each is supplied
with a warrant from the British Consul
here.
One of the pilois speaking of the mode
of procedure in capturing Butler advo
cated this plan: He would board the ship
as usual, and then wiiile in conversation
wiih the captain explain to him that
"Butler" or "WelJer" is a notorious mur
derer for whom the officials of two Gov
ernments are eagerly waiting. The cap
tain would casually order some other man
and Butler to do some work on deck, and
â would immediately afierwaru order all
the other sailors alolt to shorten sail.
Then he would call Butler into the
cabin, whip out a pistol and handcuff him
where there would be no possibility of in
terference from a rough crew that might
be waiting for an excuse to eetile old
scores for ill treatment during the voyage.
THE SWEEPERS EXPLAIN.
Bloomer and Wtnkley Deny That
They Were Drunk or That They
Struck Formaman Kane.
In the columns devoted to marine intel
ligence last Friday morning The Call pub
lished a brief paragrapn to the effect that
three sweepers â Frank- C. O'Neil, P. W.
Winkley nnd J. T. B oomerâ had been
suspended by Chief Wharfinger Hoot for
intemperance, disorder.}' conduct and
rough usage of Foreman "Kane.
J. I. Bloomer, one of the men impli
cated, has given the following explanation
of the occurrence, whicu he wi3neU to re
ceive publici: y :
"At 4:15 p. m.," said Bloomer, "I was
working on the crossing, when Mr. O'Neil
came to me and told rue that the foreman
had RCOnsed both him and myself and V.
W. Winkley cf having been in a saloon.
'You know,' said O'Neil. 'that that is not
i so. Are you man enough to go to the
chief and deny it ?
"I said I was, and at once put aside my
â¢ broom and went to see the cuief in com
pany with O'Neil.
"O'Neil met the foreman on 'the way
down then 1 and thpy had some kind of an
encounter, of which I am not cognizant
myself. For my own part I never ;-a.d a
word, nor did Winkley to my Knowledge.
When we reached the office the Chief
asked us what we had to do with it, and I
gave this explanation. H* said: 'Ail
right; go and attend to your work.' We

To-Day. Mr. Sc.hy Was One of the Principal Stockholders

of the Board of Commissioner?."
P. AY. Winkley, anÂ«.her of the sweepers
lately discharged by the Harbor Commis
sioners, and who it was alleged had
been intoxicated on Wednesday, also de
nies the impeachment, and states that he
did not enter a saloon on that day; and
t.e further say* that it is prejudice on the
part of Head Sweeper Kane to have him
reported and discharged. He says he
struck Kane to protect Boomer, who is a
colored man.
An Inventor Arrested.
Gus Howard, the engineer from Australia
who was arrested Friday, had a choree of ob
taining goods by false preten>es booked
against him yesterday. Howard is the in
ventoroi a gasometer for manufacturing a
new gas, and different people have advanced
him money and goods to help him in perfect

skeptical on the subject and Howara was ar
rested. He declares the Inventiou is all
right, but it will take some time yet before it
can be put on the market.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 31, 1897.
MANY MOURN FOR
PRENTISS SELBY.
A Representative Business
Man Who Mads Many
Friends.
His Early Achievements Identi
fied With the State's
Development.
Funeral Services Will Be Heid This
Aftern on From the Oakland
Residence.
The funeral of Premiss Selby, who died
in Oakland Friday shortly before raid
night, will be heid at 2 o'clock this af :er
noon from the family residence at 1363
Madison street. Rev. Dr. Coyle will be
the officiating minister. The interment,
which will be private, is to be at Moan
tain View Cemotery.
In the death of Prentiss Selby California
lias lost a representative business man.
Although comparatively young (he had
not yet reached his fiftieth year), his
achievements were strongly associated
with the development of the State. He
was of retiring and domestic tastes, but
he had multitudes of friends in this City
and Oakland.
Mr. Selby was born in New York Btate.
The greater part of his early life was
passed at Stockbridge, Mass. In 1855 his
father, Thomas H. Selby, arrived in this
City and at once opened a hardware store
on California street. The venture proved
profitable and in two or three years he
was joined by his son, Prentiss, and his
daughter, now Mrs. Jackson Kaiston of
Oakland.
Prentiss worked in his father's store for
a short time, coinefdently devoting much
labor to the study of metallurgy. This
profited him when he was placed in the
smelting works at North Beach which his
father with others had started.
The sou took an active interest in the
business^and rapidly rose in the scale of
responsibility until he was superintend
ent of the works.
Not being satisfied with the methods
pursued on this coast, Prentiss Sol by took
a i rip to inspect the large establishments
of the E ist. Profi.ing by his experience he
was enabled to pick up many valuable
ideas concerning the reduction of mentis,
which be lost no time in applying upon
his return to this coast.
Upon the death ot Thomas H. Selby his
son succeeded to his interest in the works,
and thus he became one of the largest
stockholders in the concern. This inter
est he retained until the time of his death.
A few years ago he relinquished ihe ac
tive management of tiie business, but he
has always remained in close touch with
those who had it under their control.
Prentiss Selby never sought political
honors, and the only societies he is known
to have belonged to are the Presbyterian
church and the Athenian Club. He was
twice married, the first time to Mis 9
Church, who died in 1881, and later xo
Miss Collin, who survives him. He leaves
aix children, all living at home. The
eldest, Premies Selby Jr., is employed at
the smelting worss. All are prominent in
Oakland society.
Mr. Selby was liberal and charitable.
His estate is thought to be somewhere in
the neighborhood of $150,000.
NEARLY A FIGHT.
Counselor Beii Napthaly and Barrister
tliin Long Had a Dispute About
Their Hats.
The main corridor of the new City Hall
near thecourtroomsof Judges Wallace and
Cook was enlivened when Attorney Be.i
Napthaly met Attorney Jim Long the other
day.
'â¢You've got my hat on yet and I want
you to take it off," said Mr. Lone.
"It's your hat all right, but I'll not take
it off till you return mine," replied Mr.
Napthaly with spirit. "You took my hat
and I look yours. That's what's the mat
ter."
Mr. LoÃfifâ Well, you taKe my hat down
to my office and gtu your old catiy.
Mr. Napthaiy â Don't you dare, sir, to
speak disrespectfully of my headgear. Be
sides what's the matter oi your bringing my
hat to my office?
Mr. Lour â Your office! Where in hades
is your office/
Mr. Natphaly â Never mind about where
my office is. You just produce the tile.
You hear me?
Mr. Long (advancing in a threatening
manner)â Now, don't you make any snide
breaks or I'll smash you.
Mr. NaDthaly (bristling up) â You will,
will you?
Mr. Loug (assuming a Fitzsimmons at
titude)â Yaaa! That's what I'll do. And
it won't be the tirst time.
Mr. Napthaly (somewhat perturbed on
account of reminiscences) â Well, you
don't see me running, do you? When 1
run I'm a sprinter, but when I stop I'm a
stayer.
Just as the bugles were about to sound
the charge Bailiffs Curtis and Samuels sal
lied forth from their rospective court
rooms and witli one voice crieii: "Here,
you gentlemen, remember that you are
gentlemen ana ciear this corridor or
you'll get run in."

great sacrifice clearance sale, and .an
nounces in the advertising columns of to
day's issue of The Call some phenome
nal bargains in silks, uresa goods, domes

REPLEVIN SUITS COMMENCED
By Kohler & Chase Againut the Pacific
Music Company.
Kohler & Chase, through their attorney,
William Kigby, have begun several re
plevin suits against the Pacific Music
Company (Ernest Lomler and B A.
Schlot) carrying on business at 816 Market
ana 11 O'Farrell streets, to recover certain
pianos which belong to the plaintiffs in
question and were placed in possession of
the Pacific Music Company lor sale on
commission.
One William Schmitz, who has been a
partner of the firm in connection with the
sale and renting of pianos, also claims,
under an alleged bill of sale, a number oi
pianos as his property. The amount in
volved in the Kohler & Chase proceedings
is not more than $1300. It is, however,
understood that the company is otherwise
indebted to local people and to Eastern
houses for goods and merchandise, and
that its total liability in this connection
represents a large sum of money.
Hide Thief Sentenced.
Stephen Daley, convicted of stealing Hides
from a San Bruno road tannery, has been sen
tenced by Judge Cook to pay $240 fine or go to
jail for 120 days.

SAW SERPENTS
AND WATERSPOUTS
Captain Graham Had Sev
eral Remarkable Ex
periences.
Had to Fire Shots Into Water
spouts to Save His
Ship.
The American ship W. F. Babcock ar
rived from New York last Friday and
docked at Howard-street wharf yesterday.
The cargo is wanted in a hurry and
Captain Graham is anxious to get it out,
as be is chartered to load sugar at Hono
lulu for New York. In consequence no
time will be lost in discharging and ballast
ing the vessel.
The iiabcock has had an eventful trip
around the Horn. She was in storms and
hurricanes and beset by waterspouts. The
sea serpent was sighted, and on one occa
sion the vessel was on her beam emls.
The ship's coat died from eating shavings
â indigestion â but nevertheless all else
ended well.
Lying in her berth yesterday the Bab
cock was a credit to the American mercan
tile, marine. Although only twenty-four
hours after getting into port from a long
passage she was as spick and span alow
and aloft as a yacht, and members of the
Navai Reserve should pay a visit to the
gallant .-kipper anil learn how easy it is to
run a big vessel, even though hurricanes,
sea serpents and storms are encountered.
When talking about the voyage yester
day Captain Graham remiirked: "We
were in latitude 25.55 north, longitude 37
west, wheu we encountered a severe elec
tric storm. The wind blew so hard that
we had to reduce the ship to three lower
topsails and foresail. The thunder came
in a succession of peals, and it seemed as
though all the artillery of the heavens
was at work. Flash after tia-h of light
ning played around the Jiabcocfc and
made the scene as light as day. The rain
came down in torrents," concluded the
captain, in a matter-of-iact way, "alto
gether making one of the most disagreea
ble nights 1 have ever experienced."
For two weeks all went well, and then
the big clipper had another experience.
In latitude 9.16 north, longitude 29 43
west, she was chased by two waterspouts.
Says Captain Graham: "They matte no
right astern and were rapidly approach
ing the ship.
"They extended from the water to the
clouds, the Jargest one apparently being
about fifty feet in circumference. I at
once ordered all sail taken in, because if
one of the spouts struck us with sail set
then the masts would have gone t>y the
board, and even if the spout had> struck
us and we had had all sail furled I think
the ship would have been dismasted.
"The largest one came quite near to us,
when a roaring sound could be beard.
Just then I remembered to have heara
that the concussion caused by a rifle shot
would break the column of water. I
ordered a rifle brought from the armory
and two shots were fired into the advanc
ing column of water in quick succession.
Suddenly it began to tremble at the base
and finally disappeared. Whether it was
the reports of the rifle that caused it to
break or whether it was from natural
causes Ido not know. 1 do know, how
ever, that the Babcock had a very narrow
escape. The .smaller waterspout took a
different direction and went away to the
leeward oF the vessel."
One day later the Babcock encountered
the sea serpent. It was in latitude 8 deg.
02 mm. north, longitude 28 detr. 40 mm.
west, and the vessel was somewhere in
the vicinity of the mouth of the river Am
azon. "It was about 9a. m.," said Captain
Graham, "when we p.issed close to a large
sea serpent. It was apparently asleep.
It was of a dirty green color mixed with
spots of black. It waa partially coiled
and, as near as I could judge, was from
thirty to forty feet long and about two
feet in circumference. It had a long,
flat head and, outside of its size and
length, looked like an ordinary land
snake. It may have been washed out of
one of the rivers on the Atlantic coast of
South America, but that I cannot vouch
for. All I know is that my wife is willing
to swear on a stack of bibles that she saw
the original sea serpent."
The Babcock came here a year ago from
New York and went to Honolulu to load
a-.igar for the metropolis. She will repeat
the voyage agrin this year and Captain
Gratom expects to make just as good
timi* His little daughter Gladys is still
the fthip's mascot, but she mourns the loss
of her goat. The animal was born in
British Columbia and would not eat
American hay. Instead she developed an
inordinate liking for shavings and saw
liust and indigestion killed her. A goat
that will eat American hay is badly
wanted aboard the VV. F. Babcock.
The following changes to go into effect
to-morrow have been ordered by the Chief
Wharfinger: Wharfinger Walknp goes
irom Beale street to section 2 of the sea
wall and ThomaÂ» Deasey takes his place.
John Lycett, collector at Beale street, poes
to section 3 of the seawall, thus changing
places with "Tom" Casey, who relieves
him.
Very quick time has been made with the
discharging ot the brig John D. Spreckels.
Arriving F.-iuay afternoon, she was docked
at the refinery ai 2:40 p. m., and at 1:50
p. m. yesterday she was discharged and at
3:45 p. m. she was alongside the Pacific
street wharf takin - in cargo for Honolulu.
This timp has been beaten, however.
Captain Howard, superintendent of the
Oceanic Steamship Company, took the
Voiant out of her winter-quartprs at Sau
salito a lew months a^o, ballasted and
provisioned her, put a crew aboard and
sent her f o sea inside of eight hours.
The American ship M. P. Grace arrived
from Baltimore last night. J. W. Johan
sen, one of the sailors, fell from the main
yard on October 30 and was drowned.
THE LARGEST FLAG
IN THE WORLD
Is Now Being Made Here
for Hawaii and Will Be
Eighty Feet Long.
Will Consume 700 Yards of Bunt
ing and Fly From a Pole
150 Feet Long.
Captain George C. Beckley of the Wilder
Steamship Company, Honolulu, who ar- ,
rived here recently to take back the new V
steamer Helene, lately launched here, is A
having the largest flag made of whicb.
shipping men have ever hear l. It will
be of the extraordinary width of fom'
feet and will be eighty feet long, consum
ing in all no less than 700 yards of bunt
ing.
This monster flag is to be raised on tlie
Helene on the maiiien trip of that vessel,
as she leaves i ere for the Hawaiian
Islands. It is a Hawaiian flag, of course,
and as such will dwarf every other fl.ig,
no matter of what nation, that comes into
port.
When the Helene gets to Honolulu the
flag will be taken down and wili finally be
put on a iriganiic pole, towerine in the air
from the heights of Punchbowl Hill. The
pole will be, as Captain Beckley tells, 153
feet long. It was made of a monstrous
Puget Sound fir tree, and is now en route
to the islands on the bark Klickitat.
The way Captain Beckley happened to
get the idea of eclipsing the world in the
way of flags is peculiar. He is a commo
dore in the Hawaiian navy, and has been
for over thirty-five years Vitb the afore
said steamahiD company, of which he is
a director. On the eve of his departure
for this country he was given a (iinner by
the employes of the company and pre
sented with a fat purse. Captain Beckley
said, as it* was handed to him:
"The money will be used in the pur
chase of the largest Hawaiian flag ever
f-een in Hawaii. It will be larger than the
great Hag of the American League, and I
will fly irom the foremast of the Helenei
from San Francisco to Honolulu. Then i% j
wil: float from a tall pole in my yam on/
thf slope of Punchbowl Hill."
This is why h heavy flag manufacturing
firm here is now busy with the great flag.
'â¢It will be the bigpest flag of which I
ever beard," said Captain BecKlay yester
day. "There isn't another one like it in
the world."

SHAKING UP THE
SCHOOL JANITORS.
Democratic School Directors
Caucused and Then
Voted.
Waller's Proposition to Drop
Special Teachers Did Not
Go Through.
Superintendent Babcock Thinks the
Grand Jury Guilty of Unwar
ranted Meddling.
The various resolutions submitted by
School Director Waller for the considera
tion of the Board of Education, having
for their purpose the dropping of special
teachers and an at>portionmont of the
funds of the department among the com
mittees of the board on his plan, did not
go yesterday afternoon. Mr. Waller
made a little speech in which he said that
the special teachers whom he proposed to
drop were doing pood work, but that they
ought to be dispensed with and the posi
tions abolished in the interest of economy.
The board listened and voted to refer all
his recommendations concerning the dis
missal of special teachers to the Classifica
tion Committee, which puts the matter
over. The special teachers whom Mr.
Waller wanted to dL-roiss are the teachers
of drawing, cooking, singng, manual
training, history with the stereopticon,
free-hand drawing in the Polytechnic
lii^h, Spanish :n the Polytechnic High
and Lincoln High and physical culture.
The sense of tha board was ascertained
through the proposition to declare the po
sition occupied by Mis-* K. M. Ball,
teacher of drawing, vacant. Miss Ball
draws $150 per month. When the board
voted to refer tne other propositions took
the same course.
The messenger of the board, Frank W.
Yale, was superseded by William Tobin,

BaDcock for long and efficient service,
will continue two weeks to instruct his
successor.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 31, 1897.
ANOTHER EXAMINER "CREELMAN."
And still these "Creelmans" continue. For two days the Examiner has been printing under lurid
headlines a story of how Dr. Williamson had been offered a big bribe from a mysterious man on condition
that the Board of Health compel the Chinatown property-owners to fumigate their premises with a certain
disinfectant.
The story was played up as red-hot news stuff for two days. On Friday morning the first install
ment was dished up in a narrative of the circumstances attending the offering of the bribe. Yesterday
morning came a sequel narrative that the Grand Jury was about to ask Dr. Williamson to appear before it
and tell of the crime.
In this instance the bribery story, which is palmed off on the readers of the paper as fresh news, is
as musty as many of the other fakes that mark the management of the paper. It is so ancient that Dr.
Williamson can hardly now, after trying two days, recall the incidents. It happened almost two years ago,
a few days after Dr. Williamson's appointment to the Board of Health by Governor Budd and was printed
at that time in the newspapers for what it was worth.
Now it comes up in a new dress and is palmed off as fresh news and hung out with a flare to startle
the Grand Jury.
"The story is so ancient," said Dr. Williamson, yesterday, "that I remember very little of it.
Shortly after my appointment by the Governor 1 believe some fellow called on me one day and talked
about paying me $600 a month or something, if the Board of Health would recommend a certain disinfectant
for Chinatown. I never gave the affair a second thought, and have heard nothing of it from that day to
this."
The story was printed long ago by the Examiner itself, and is probably revamped at this late day
for the purpose of enabling some impecunious space-writer to square accounts with his landlady. Copies of
the Examiner with the word " exclusive " written in bold blue letters over the reborn bribery story are
doubtless now on their way to Mr. Hearst. He, when the papers arrive, will forget his bitter rivalry with
the Police Gazette long enough to give the tribute of a smile â that witching smile â to the genius and
enterprise of the only Long Green.
pointed, consisting of Directors Bagan,
Waller and Drucker.
Superintendent Babcock criticized the
Grand Jury. He said that what the Grand
Jury has to do with the policy of the
Board of Education is a conundrum. He
particularly scored the Grand Jury for the
recommendation concerning the teachers
in the department who live in Alameda
County.
ADDITIONAL LIGHTS.
Frecita Valley and Mission-Street Im
provements Are Up to
Date.
The public-spirited storekeepers and
residents of the Mission and Precita Val
ley are pushing their sections to the front
on the improvement lines with commend
able energy.
Mission street, from Twentieth to
Twenty-second, has added electric lights
to those two blocks, which were bril
liantly illuminated last night for the first
time.
It was originally intended to celebrate
the event last night, but the threaten
ing condition of the weather interfered
with the piano and the demonstration will
take place some night next week, probably
Thursday evening. The celebration com
mittee consists of O. Waibel, R. P. Kava
naugh, H. Â£. Snook and S. Lippman.
Those gentlemen met with every en
couragement from the residents on the
blocks mentioned, and it is predicted that
the gap between Sixteenth and Twen
tieth will be spanned ere long with the
white current, which will give one contin
uous stream of light along that portion of
the street.
In the meantime the people down in the
Precita Valley have not been idle in bring
ing their section to the front.
At a meeting of the Precita Valley Im
provement Club on Friday nieht, at Gra
ham Hall, on Alabama and Twenty-sev
enth streets, the executive committee re
ported that the petitions of tne club to
lay sewers on Bryant street, from Twenty
sixth to Army, and on Precita avenue,
from Alabama street to the junction of
Army and York, had been granted by the
Board of Supervisors.
A petition was forwarded to the Board
of Supervisors, requesting that no exten
sion of time be granted to the contractors
who have been awarded the contract for
grading Precita avenue. The contract
was awarded three weeks ago, and since
that time no work has been done. The
contractors are relying upon two ways out
of their dilemma, one being the chance of
subletting the contract and the other to
obtain further time from the Supervisor?.
The residents and property-owners hi the
; valley want the work done, and that
quickly, as the condition of the valley re
quires immediate attention to get the
streets into condition preparatory to im
proving Bernal Park.
ME. GUNST IS HOPEFUL.
Expect* That the J,e|riÂ»lat lire Will Yet
Consent to Kis Prolonged Absence.
Police Commissioner M. A. Gunst is
casting longing eyes toward the giddy
capitals and the soothing springs of
Europe, and some day be hopes to be joy
i ously pacing the quarter deck of a trans*
j Atlantic liner and seeing, through the blue
wreaths of his cigar smoke, the justly cel
ebrated charms of the Old World.
Time was when the Commissioner could
! see a panorama of European delights in
bis cigar smoKe, even as he paced the
ultra- American thoroughfares of this City.
i But that was many months ago, when the
hopes of a trip across tbe pond were new.
Of late all be Uas been able to discern in
the blue vapor of his Havana was an in
! flexible provision of the State law, which
j reads something like this: "No member
! of such commission must absent himself
I from the State more tlian sixty days, un
le-s upon business of the State, etc."
A bill was introduced by Senator Boyce
; to get an extension of sixty clays, and this
was referred to the Senate Committee oh
Elections, and Friday that committee was
I unkind enough to reject it by a vote lack
ing one of unanimity.
Commissioner Gunst is in no wise dis
couraged by this circumstance. ''The bill
was rejected, why?" he asked. "Simply
because it was not referred to the right
committee. Besides, tne man who intro
duced it was ill and could not be there to
explain it. it is a perfectly just measure.
It Is designed for cases of sickness. There
is Justice Garoutte, who is in Honolulu
now. He cannot return within the re
quired sixty days, it is said. The late
Lieutenant-Governor was brought back to
the State while at the point of death to
escape this enactment. Many other States
j have provided for a like contingency.
"In my own case, 1 would have gone to
Europe, as advised by my physicians,
several months ago but for this law. I
expect to go in April now, for I am confi
dent this bill will pass. I hope to be gone
lour or rive months."
VOLUNTEER FIREMEN.
The Veteran Fighters Held Their An
ihirl Banquet at the Lick House-
Tfae annual banquet of tbe Veteran Vol
unteer Firemen's Association of Califor
nia took place last night in the dining
room of the Lick House. About 100 per
sons were present, among them bsing
some of the best Known of fire-fighters.
The banquet-room was handsomely decor
ated; there was good music and consider
able speech-making, nearly all the speeches
dealing with reminisences of the early
times in battling with conflagrations.
Among the many prominent persons
present were:
Joseph 11. Marshall, president; Stephen
Bruuner, first vice-president ; George Carlisle,
second vice-president; James Hayden, third
vice-president; James Pennycuck, recording
secretary; Gus Pohlmann, financial secretary;
William Kalirenkrug, treasurer; Colonel A.
Andrews, John Satchweil, John Foley, Henry
Kohn, John McGreery, board of directors;
Fred H. Will. L. Beleneer, R. Harrold, trustees;
James C. Carroll, serjeant-at-arms.
The menu was elaborate, and the ban
quet lasted for several boars.
MRS. EDGERTON
MAKES HER DEBUT
She Wins Success as Queen
Elizabeth at the
Baldwin.
Modjeska Is Herself Again as
the Unfortunate Marie
Stuart.
A Notable Performance in Which
Consistent Playing Won GanÂ»
eral Applause.
Mrs. Frances Edgerton is so well known
and has so many friends in this City that
there was standing room only at the Bald
win last night for those who had not taken
MRS. FRANCES EDGERTON.
time by the forelock in securing tickets
for her professional debut with the Mod
jeska company in "Marie Stuart."
The performance was a notable one in
many respects. Modjesks, whose radiance
was dimmed in the part of Magda, showed
almost her old-time power to thrill her
hearers in the role of the unfortunate
Queen of Scots. Haworth and Louergan
were both on their mettle and did bril
liant work, and Mrs. Frances Edgerton,
in the role of Queen Elizabeth, won sev
eral curtain, calls and the unstinted ap
plause of friends and strangers alike.
The wily Queen Elizabeth is a difficult
and ambitious part for a debutante to
essay, but Mrs. Edgerton's success proved
that she had formed no exaggerated esti
mate of her powers in undertaking it.
Although last night was her debut as an
actress, she ha? ha. l plenty of experience
in reciting in public; indeed, she has
been for some years one gof the best
known elocutionists in the City.
The ease with which she fell into an

KM
acting role proved that there can be
brilliant exceptions to the rule, so often
laid down Dy actors, that elocution is not
the best stepping-stone to the stage. Mrs.
Edgerton was as much at home on the
ata^e as one to the manner born, and her
fine voice and perfect enunciation did her
excellent service. If she felt any tremors
of nervousness she betrayed none.
In her make-un the debutante had evi
dently followed the famous Holbein paint
ing of Queen Elizabeth, though her face
is rounder and prettier than the deter
mined countenance that the Flemish
artist grave to England's Virgin Queen.
Mrs. Edgerton has an imposing stage
presence and in the matter of dress she
was fully as magnificent as history re
cords her prototype to have been.
"When the curtain went up on the audi
ence chamber of Queen Elizabeth that
monarch was discovered on her throne in
a dazzling costume of yellow and white
satin, with a jeweled stomacher and a
court train of sapphire-colored velvet
lined with ermine and embroidered with
the lilies of France.
The scenes for which Mrs. Edgerton was
especially applauded were her meeting
with Mary in the park at Folheringay and
the scene where she signed her cousin's
death warrant. In the park she assumed
the studiously insulting and haughty
demeanor of Elizabeth very cleverly and
never showed by a tremor that she was a
novice.
In the scene where Leicester and Bur
leigh unre Elizabeth to sign Mary's death
warrant Mrs. Edgerton was strongest, in
deed she gave an admirable portrayal of
the woman in Elizabeth struggling for
supremacy with the Queen in her; she
toyed with her love for Leicester, refusine
to believe h m guilty though she knew
him to be so, and she toyed with her de
sire for revenge on Mary in so clever
and Elizabethan a way that Mrs. Edger
ton more than deserved the hearty ap
plause she received.
A little experience will soon teach the
debutante a few tricks of the actor's trade
in which she was lacking, as. for instance,
a greater sweep of gesture; but trick* such
as these are a mere matter of practice and
experience. Mrs. Edgerton's debnt was a
brilliant one, worthy of the brilliant aus
pices under which it was made.
Modjeska was herself again as Mary
Stuart. She entered with her old-time
feeling into the dignity and pathos of the
part. Her voice was stronger than it has
been this season. Her interpretation of
Mary is well known, and it is card to be
lieve that she was ever more appealingly
pathetic and queen-like witlial than she
was last nigtit in the park aX Fotheringay
scene.
Her farewell in the prison also brought
tears to the eyes of some of her admirers,
and they were not, as on Monday nigbt,
tears that Modjeska was no longer herself,
but were spontaneous tributes to her art.
Haworth, as Sir Edward Mortimer, lived
and died in a noble, manly way, and
Lonergan made a brave appearance as tne
wily Leicester, and won tbe admiration
of the audience as a most accomplished
tra.tor. The rest of the cast was fairly
satisfactory, though there was nothing to
call for special comment.
It gives as pleasure to call ourrtaders' attention
to the value of Brown's Broncbial Troches as a
remÂ«dy for throat jiff ctiona. Thefactthatthe.se
troches hnv? been manufactured and sold for over
fifty years Is an evidence of their real merit.
While it Is true that Nature does not endow every
one with a sweet. well-modulated voice, yet there
is no voice so discordant but that by care and
training it may be rendered pleasant, if not sweet
and musical. The greatest artist coold not hope
to entrance us with his music if his instrument
were out of tuue; and so the larynx must be kept
in tune, or it will not send forth pure, sweet tones.

TO DEVELOP
IRIS COUNTY
A Boulevard Projected
From Sausalito to
San Rafael.
It May Also Run to Tiburon if
the Conditions of the Bond-
Issue Allow.
A Large Number of Improvement
Clubs in the County Are Inter
ested in the Project
There is a project on foot in -Marin
county wnereby the promoters ttope to
derive lasting benefit. Briefly Vat*d it is
a boulevard to run from Sausalito up the
coast to San Anselmo, thence to San
Rafael and by branch lines to San Quen
tin, trending southward by Reeds to
Tiburon.
The project is considered by many im
provement clubs in the county as likely
to prove of immense benefit, and a bill is
now pending before the Legislature calcu
lated to promote its consummation. The
Northern California Division of the League
of American Wheelmen ia sail to strongly
favor the project.
Among those who have indorsed the
enterprise are: Marin Development Asso
ciation; Ambrose Harris, president Lark
spur Club; B. Allen Brown, secretary
Larkspur Club; E. Steele, Mill Valley
Club; W, A. Boole Jr., Ross Station
Club; C. A. Harmon, Larkspur Club;
Hepburn Wilkins, San Rafael Club;
Edgar C. Chapman, Larkspur Club; S.
Sylva, Corte Madcra Club; Commo
dore C. Harrison, Sausalito Club; Judge
Thomas H. Fottrell, Mill Valley Club.
Ambrose Harris, president, and Morris
Schwartz, secretary of the Marin Develop
ment Association, were talking yesterday
about the proposed idea and the best
means for bringing it to a successful con
clusion.
Speaking of the plan and its develop
ment Mr. Harris said:
The Sausalito-San Rafael boulevard move
ment inaugurated by the Marin Improvement
Association seems destined to extend into a
chain of roads reaching to all parts of the
county. The association has been at wort de
veloping ieassble plans to follow out in the
rjood roads movement, and from information
given out by the executive committee after
consultation with a number of leading people
and carefully working upon the proposition it
is thought that the best plan to take up is one
contemplating a road system beginning at
Sausalito and Tiburon, running thence to Han
Rafael, and from there branching out to Bo
linas, Tomales and Novato.
The reasons that argue for this are several.
In the first place any improvement of consid
erable dimensions in one part of the county
must have an important Influence on all other
pins by reason of their interdependence,
Furthermore, a plan like this being complete
in establishing the main arteries of a road
system for the whole county is entitled to bo
considered us much more valuable than a de
tached and fragmentary proposition.
A further consideration, and a consideration
of great importance, is the fact that the money
for road purposes must be raised, if the plan
which has met with the greatest approval be
followed, by the whole county. The com
promise plan, to consider only the first portion
of tne system, the remaining portion to be
provided for at a later date, will meet and has
met with opposition which is not wise, and
which, it is not necessary, to create.
A plan which provided for an equitable and
full consideration of all pans of the county
obviates this objection ana should receive the
support oi all sections without dissent.
From preliminary estimates made by the
engineer of the California Development Asso
ciation, it is considered chat the sum of
$100,000 will be sufficient to construct a wide
ana substantial roadway from Sausalito to San

sary money. The plan which seems the
most feasible and the one which Is : the most
favored is a bond issue. This will enable the
early completion of the whole work and in a
manner that will make a very small tax ample
to cover the expense ; of the work. A bond
issue of the required sum would call for an in-
terest and sinking fund charge of five, to six
thousand dollars a year, covering interest on
a ame and a sinking fund sufficient to mature in
thirty or thirty-five years. The assessed value
of property in the County amounts to twelve
and a half millions, so a levy of 4 to 5 cents on
the $100 will fully cover the issue. Consider
ing the importance anrt the far-renchin'g bene
fits of the pinn outlined this would bo a very
small sura. It has been suggested that it could
be saved out of the present road fund, by
reason of the factihat new construction would
be provided for by the plan for some time.
Aside from this, however, it is quite clear that
ihe increase in population and values from
its successful completion will result in >i short
time in increasing the rpvenues of the County
by a sum more than sufficient to cover the few
thousand dollars a yenr which it necessitates.

THE TARPEY STAKE
WON By SCHILLER
Barney Schreiber's Colt
Headed His Field Out
With Ease.
The Favorite, St Lee, Finished
Third Behind Sweet
Faverdale.
Clissie B Sauntered In at Odds of 30 to 1
Sir Wiliiam a Clevsr Youngster.
Hello First at ro to 1.
It was a real old-time rainstorm that
race-goers braved to see the sport at Ingle
side track yesterday. It has been said
that nothing short of death or the "price"
will keep an enthusiast at the game in
doors, and a glance at the crowd proved
that the originator of the saying was wise
in every sense of the word. The regulars
were all there with umbrellas, mackin
toshes, bright hopes and considerable
loose change, which they were relieved of
later on.
It threatened rain before the first race,
and before the afternoon had grown old
the liquid visitation from the skies nearly
obscured a view of the horses running in
the different events. The hand of late
marked the favorite for defeat, and with
the exception of Ostler Joe, which at that
was not a teeming hot one, one after an
other went to the slaughter- pen.
In one or two instances their downfall
smacked oi the unreal, but mud accom
plishes wonders in distorting form into all
sorts of fantastic shapes.
The track, which at first was inclined to
be dry and cuppy. was soon transformed
into a sea of "mud and the web-footed
horses had it all their own way.
The Tarpey selling stake, over a mile
and a furlong, with a gross valie of $1300,
was in a measure responsinle for the heavy
attendance. The field simmered down to
Argentina 97. Semper L x 106, Schiller 98,
Key del Bandidos9B, Sweet Faverdale 97,
St. Lee 100. Gallant 100 and Foremost 100
pounds. It had a most open look, and the
ring laid good odds against each of the
eight starters. At post time St. Lee at
twos ruled first choice, with Sweet Faver
dale, Schiller and Semper Lex fancied in
the order named.
At ihe post Argentina and St. Lee were
inclined to cut up a few pranks. Trie
bunch was finally dispatched to a nice
start. After passing the stand Gallant
went out and, followed by Sweet Faver
dale, made ihe running until nearin^ the
benii for tbe wire, at which stage Slaugh
ter, astride Schiller, made his move, and
as the li^ld became pointed for home Bar
ney Schreiber's colors loomed up in front,
from mat on the result was never in
doubt, Schiller holding his company safe
ana romping in three lengths before
tweet Faverdale, with St. Lee in the
show. The winner's time was 1:5834.
The upsets began in the firs:, race run.
a s-ix-furlong selling affair, wuen Clissie B
strolled leisurely in at the comfortable
odds of 30 to 1, though at post time 12 was
the best obtainable. The mare came on
from sixth place and beat Roy Carruthers,
which had made the running, a length.
The favorite. Lady Looram, was sixth.
And now Queen Blazes is no longer a
wonder; neither is Tne Cheat. .Both were
expected to accomplish wonders in the
three and a half furlong spin for two-year
olds, and failed signally. The winner
turued up in Sir William, a nicely turned

the finish and downed The Cheat half a
length, starting at the fancy odds of 15 to
1. The Cheat was post favorite.
H. Martin had the mount on Ostler Joe
in the mile handicap, and he appears to
be just a pound or so better than H.
Brown, ''"he black horse and Salisbury II
occupied the sent of honor in the betting,
each going to the post at - odds of 11 to 5.
Salisbury made the running for half the
distance, when Ostler Joe took up the cue
and in a drive at the end downed â Wawona,
a 15 to 1 shot, and one of the lightweights
of the company, half a length in I:46}Â£.
Morte Fonse, with Sloan up, was a lair
thifd.
The telephone horse Hello was a right
warm one in the mile and a half hurdle
handicap. With "Stew" Peters in the sad
dle i.c sauntered over to the post an 8 to 1
chance in the betting, and in a rait!insÂ»
drive passed the judges a scant length
ahead of Montalvo, the 3 to 2 .avorite. rid
den dv George Cochrane. Fi Fi, piloted
by Bob Cairns, was a good third.
Major Cook don't seem 'to be of much
account the-e day?. With T. Sloan up he
opened in the ring a 2 to 1 favorite for the
six-furlong run tuat was sixth on the card,
but could do no nett r than end up in
third place, behind Double Quick and Mo
bnlaska. The winner. Double Quiet, with
Clawson up, was backed down by wise
coin from 15 to 5 to 1.
The final race of the day was over a
mile. St. Aienon was heavily backed to
win, his odds being forced down from 8 to
5' to even. Eddie Jones hustled iiuD. Sain,
one of the second choices out in front,
and, ridden out, the black colt crossed the
line nearly two lengths in advance of the
first choice. Cnarley Thorpe landed Mo
nita in the show. -
THE CITY HAS NO TITLE.
Two Opinion* Given by the City and
County Attorney.
City and County Attorney Creswell has
filed two opinions concerning property in
which the City and County was concerned.
Emily and George A. Pope last year
tiled a petition claiming title for upward
of thirty years and exclusive possession
of a parcel of land ou the south line of
Sacramento street, 275 feet east of Drumm,
fronting on Sacramento street seventy
five feet and running through to Market.
The peiiiion was referred to the City and
County Attorney, who has reported th-it
tho property does not appear on the offi
cial maps of the City and County as City
property, but does appear upon the Asses
sor's blockbook and is so put down in the
list of City property. The dile wan de
rived from the State under the act of
March 26, 1851, known as the beach and
water lot act, whereby the State leased to
the City and- County for a term of ninety
one years certain beach and water lots,
the title of which was held by the State.
Peier Smith brought action against the
City, and on March 4. 1851, recovered judg
ment for |45.538 82. He aiso secured judg
ment against the City for $19,239 on an
other suit, and execution on boih judg
ment issued on December 8, 1851. The
Siier.ff cold tbe lot, with another lot, to
George McDougal. James Beckett and J.
K. Maioney for $1750, giving the Sheriff's
deed. Although the period of six months
'or redemption had not elapied the title
passed, and Emily A. Pope and George A.
Pope claim title under this sale. Attorney
Creswell tinds that tbe City hRs had no
title in the lot since January 6, 1852.
Concerning the issue raised by Emily T.
Pope in a petition requesting that water
lot 66. on Oregon street, be expunged from
the official map. Mr. Ore- well reports that
"whether tiiut strip became ile-licaicd to
the uses on the part or t!ie public lor the
requisite number of years is a question of
fact into which I cannot inquire even if
directed by the board to do so, because I
have no authority to administer oaths in
the examination of witnesses."
Lecislative committee's Clerk.
The Committee on Legislation of the Board
of Supervisors has appointed John E. Hamill,
formerly a State Senator, to act as clÂ»>rk to
keep charge of legislation affecting San Fran
cisco, at a cos: oi $1000,
Measles on the Incrrase.
Measles are on the increase. Within the past

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, STTNDAT2* JANUARY 31, 3 897.
DEFENSE READY
TO FIGHT BACK
Promises of Some Sur
prises in the Cooney
Case.
Owners of Deeds Used as Evi
dence Clamoring for Their
Property.
Butler Smith Obliged to Threaten
Lees With a Lawsuit to Re*
cover a Mortgage.
The Cooney case nas reached a stage
redolent of spicy developments to come
on both sides. In answer to the numer
ous charges made by Captain Lees and his
de;ectives there are hints that when the
defense begins to unload iis ammunition
some startling surprise will ensue. Not
withstanding the /act that the expert., lor
the prosecution are aware that the attor
neys ior the notary have in their posses
sion fac-similes of the Crocker blanks of
1896, printed by Jame.< H. iiarry, tliey are
not sure that this is the only plan to lest
their skill.
For this reason the Fair people have
become seriously alarmed at the trend of
t. c last few days' developments. The dis
covery of the Barry blanks in its hrst
view looked something very promising;
but a day's deliberation over it somewhat
mitigated its importance and they have
redoubled ttieir energies in searching for
other evidence to use against Cooney. The
credit of the discovery of the Barry
blanks does not belong to Captain Lees,
the detectives and his assistants, although
he was content at first to receive all the
praise. Attorney K. B. Mitchell obtained
the information through a conversation
with the manager of a printing supply
house, on the Oakland ierry some days
ago, and in turn conveyed the news to
Charlie Fair's detectives.
Captain Lees finds himself in some hot
water on account of numerous deeds and
mortgages that have gone into the court
within the past week as evidence against
Cooney. These deeds were gathered from
the four corners of the State to show that
Cooney was in the habit of using a notarial
certificate with his name printed on it.
These instruments are in the custody of
Magistrate Carroll Cook as "exhibits,"
and as the case promises to be much lou.er
drawn out than at first supposed, some of
the owners of the documents are anxious
to have their property returned.
In one particular instance the chief of
detectives much against his will was
obliged to return one of these instruments
under threat of legal proceeding. On
December 2 a mortiiu^o acknowledged by
Cooney for the purpose of evidence
was borrowed from Butler Smith,
a real estate agent. The mortgage was
loaned on the condition that it should be
returned on demand, but it was not until
January 2 after numerous demands on
the part of fcnnth that the document was
given to the owner to head off an action
to replevin it.
"I loaned the mortgage to Detective
Seymour," said Smith, "after learning
that it was to be used in the Fair case.
Seymour signed a receipt for the property,
promising to return it on demand. Now
this niortgacfi was what we call alive doc
ument and l did not care to have it out of
my custody for any length of time. A
few days later I applied for it, but was put
off with an excuse that it was a piece of
important evidence in a big criminal case
and that it should be kept by Captain
LeoÂ«.
"Up to this time I knew nothing of the
intention of the Fair hers to prosecute
Cooney. The moment I hoard of ttie
notary's arrest, I saw that the police had
been dragged into a case thaf I supposed
was one of civil litigation. I had my
opinions about tbe whole affair and I
again demanded my mortgage. There
were more excuses and I finally put the
matter before an attorney. A week ago
Monday morning I called on Captain L*es
and talked Dutch to him. I told him teat
unless my mortgage was returned I would
take legal steps to return it.
"After hearing this I^ees gave me my
property and turned around and sub
penaed me as a witness, instructing me
to bring the document with me to court.
That was a week ago last Wednesday, and
1 have been dancing attendance on the
Cooney case since.
"In justice to Detective Seymour I will
say that he apologized to me. He told
me he intended to return the document
whenever I desired it, but found it im
possible to keep hii word, for the reason
that my property was in the hands of
Captain Lees, who insisted on keep
ing it."
The trial of the pencil deeds, which is
down on the calendar for hearing before
Judge Slack on Tuesday next, will un
doubtedly be postponed a week at least,
owing to a delay in the preparation of the
ury-iiats for this term of court.

Another of the Numerous ImproVements in This Wonderful
Electric Belt Is Given to All Patients Free.

make Electricity do *^Â£^H~L and with better cura-
; "^#^-5%^- Mm
better work in curing ""^rl^r 1 tive qualities than any
disease is embod'ed in other remedy is Dr.
this appliance. w7mv Sanden's aim.
THIS IS DR. SANDEN'S LATEST IMPROVEMENT IN HIS WORLD-FAMOUS
Electric Belt. It 13 as near perfect as science and money can make it. This is a
means of curing disease which is equaled by no other treatment in the world. It is
the result of thirty years of close application to one hobbyâ one glorious desire to in-
vent and perfect an appliance which will, without inconvenience, cure humanity of
the serious ills which afflict itâ and that all this study, this experimenting and self-
sacrifice on the part of Dr. S:mden is repaid can be seen from the thousands of grate-
iul voices which are raised in grateful thanksgivings to the man who has restored to
their owners health and happiness. Nor is this all. Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt enjoys
to-day the largest sale of all the remedies in the world for the cure of nervous and
chronic diseases. No other remedy or appliance approaches it in point of numbers in
use nor in its curative effects.
Dr. Sanden's latest and most important improvement is the doubling of the power
in the battery chain, making it more than ever superior to all other makes of electric
appliances in this respect. Dr. Sanden is entirely protected by patents on bis various
inventions, and no other firm can adopt or use any of the features or his Belt.
Second in importance to the increase in power of Dr. Sanden's battery is his famous
regulator â attachment for making the current mild or strong while the Belt is on
the body. With this a patient can put the belt on when retiring, set the current at
just the right power to suit the sensitiveness of the" nerves, and he can then go to
sleep knowing that while at rest his system is being saturated with the life and vital
force born of electricity. He arises in' the morning refreshed, bright and vigorous,
without any of the blistering or burning of the skin usually caused by electric belts
which cannot be controlled.
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt costs no more than others of inferior make. Its current
is warranted to be felt as soon as the Belt touches the body, and its power is guaran-
teed for one year. If a Sanden Belt gives out within one year a new one will be given
in place of it. The following are extracts from letters just received:
"I have been afflicted with rheumatism for forty-five years, tlie last three of which period 1
suffered greatly from nervous debility. Mine was a very aggravating case. After wearing your Bell
seven months I feel no rheumatic trouble and my nervous trouble is nearly gone. lam now 62 vÂ»ars
of age, and consider my improvement almost miraculous." W. 11. STAPP, Pouts Springs, Cal.
"I was all brokeu down with debility. , My nerves were completely shattered and I had severe
pains in the back. I could eai nothing without great distress afterward. 1 had been weak for years
from losies, resulting from early indiscretions. Now, after wearing your Bel', my pains are all gone,
appetite good and my strength restored. My losses are stopped and I feel strong and hearty again. I
have gained eleven pounds in the last month." JOSEPH. HENKICH.
153 Tebama street, San Francisco, Cat,
A DOCTOR'S ADVICE.
One of the reasons for tho great success of Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt is the personal
attention which Dr. Sanden gives to his patients. fore applying the Belt every
patient is given a thorough examination, free of charge, to de ermine the nature of
the complaint, and during the treatment Dr. Sanden spares no pains to cause a quick
and permanent cure. This free examination is of great value to the patient, and Dr.
Sanden, with his thirty years of medical experience, is qualified to say. frankly what
the effects of his Belt will be. In no case will a Belt be applied where it cannot do
good, as Dr. Sanden has always dealt with his patients on the principle that one cure
is the means of selling twenty more Belts, and he prefers not to sell a Belt rather
than sell one where it will do no good.
If you feel that you need help call on him, and he will tell you frankly whether
there is help for you in his Electric Belt. Consultation and examination free. If you
cannot call send for his late illustrated book, "Three Classes of Men," sent sealed, by
mail, free. Call or address *

"W That was the ?ad condition of China
l)ifn yesterday. In truth it was a blue
tray for that quarter, and the reflection
from the officers' uniforms may have had
something Vo do with it.
At 7 A. m. yesterday a platoon of 100
men, under Captain Wittman, marched
proudly forth from the California-street
station with the firm intention of carry
ing out Chief Crowley'a desire that this
Bhould be a quiet new year celebration.
Heretofore ihe Chief has not Deen ulira-
Btrict in keeping the Celestials within the
boundaries of the law during the celebra
tion o! their new year festival, but the
assassination of ''.Little Pete" changed all
that-
Another thing that gave the Chief an
uncomfortable feeling was the discovery
that to preserve peace in the local Cni
nese quarter it had been found necessary
for the Emperor of China to reach out
his "heavy hand" and "accomplish what
the President of the Uniied States had
failed to do." That nettled tue head of
the department and he came to the con

of China a few pointers in good goyern
.ment, and the President of the United
State?, too, for that matter.
Although under tlie supervision of Cap
tain Wittman, the police were detailed
into squads under the immediate com
mand of Sergeants McManus, Conboy,
Martin, Woliweoer, Blank, Cook, Harper
and Christiansen. Sergeant Mooney was
on hand with his regular squad, and Ser
geant Price had a special detail oi six men
in citizens' clothes.
Each policeman carried a long riot club
in his belt, an instrument requiring no
preat force in wielding to crack tne hard
head of even a Chinese I'iehbinder. Four
men were apportioned to a block, wLi!e
t lie sergeants nnd corporals kept mostly
in evidence on the street corners, where
they could take a general survey of two
(neets.
. c wagons at the California-street
station were kept busy answering
. Two of these nre stationed in
' -.natown and the third at the police sta
tion. Aboul forty or fiity Chinese were
arrested during the course of the day.
Tney were all char.cd with minor of
lenses, such as Vagrancy and obstructing
the sidewalks. One sickly looking ous
tomer was taken in tow for* selling opium
wituuut a prescription.
The keepers of stands were forced to
move into the streets. Tue principal
traffic of this poorer class of street venders
consists in the sale of sweetmeats and Chi
nese 'lilies.
Every now and then the po'ice would
lay violent hands on some suapicious-
Jookin,; character, rush him off into some
doorway or alley and make a sharp search
for concealed weapons. The Chinese
seemed to realize, however, that this is
not a propitious time to carry a pistol or
knife, and no highbinders were discovered
with weapons in their ppssession.
Sergeant Price believes the hatchetmen
are now -'Jying low" at the vegetable gar
dens on the outskirts of the City. Es
veeially is this true of the cutthroats from
Portland and Fresno, supposed ly sum
moned to tnis City by the Sam Yuds io
aventre "Little Pete's" death.
The "American Terror" also made the
rounds of all t!>e highbinder meeting
places. He had twenty-tyro of them on
his list and none were slighted. Among
the places visi:ed were the following:
1014 Jackson street, 742 Commercial,
1027 Stockton, 831 Dtinont, 814 Washing
ton, 805 Sacramento, 822 Jackson, 10 RoÂ«s
alley, 802 S.-.cramento street, 1 Breuham
place, 36 Waverly place, where two meet
ing-places are located, 729)4 Jackson
street, 5 Sullivan alley, 16 Spotford alley,
719Pacitic street and the See Yup head
quarters, on the corner of Clay and Du
pont streets. i
The purpose was not to make arrest
without sufficient provocation, but only
to proven t ihe bad element from gather
raw to-day:

CHIEF CROWLEY in the Role of Chines: Mandarin. He Is Convinced That Both the Emperor
of China and the President of the United States Can Be Given Pointers on How to
Preserve B-essei Peace Among the Highbinders.
ing at any of those places in force. The
inmates in every instance seemed to be
troubled witb guilty consciences, however,
for they never failed to make their escape
without any formal good-by.
At 742 Commercial street it was found
necessary to break down the door to ob
tain ingress. The, last man in the house,
a cook, was d:B' overed in the act of climb
ing throiu-h a skylight. Officer McGowan
caught him by the leg, but the fellow re
linquished his *hoe and escaped. After a
lively chase around a couple of chimney
stacks the Chinese apparently lost tiis
head and jumped fourteen feel to tbe roof
â of the next building. It was a foolhardy
venture, a slight miscalculation might
have cost h.m his life, and the police let
him depart in peace, keeping the shoe as a
memento.
It was also found necessary to break in
the door of the highbinder headquarters
on Sacramento street. Everybody in the
place escaped while this operation wan in
progress.
Sergeant Price is the happy possessor of
a newspaper from the Flowery Kingdom,
in which is given a graphic account of the
trouble some time ago in the local Chinese
quarter and the measures being taken to
preserve the peace. Especial pains are
taken in tne article to convey the impres
sion that tne San Francisco police are a
dangerous body of men to fool with. Ser
geant Price hirmelf receives high com
mendation for his efforts to suppress the
reign of terror.
Monday marks' tbe inception of another
year in the Confucian calendar. It will be
very quietly celebrated here, even tnough
the festivities last for two weeks.
Chief Crowlev has issued orders that
not a cracker be heani, not a pistol note,
since the great Little Pete was buried,
and any one discharging fireworks will get
into serious trouble with the powers that
be. The loudest noise to be heard will be
the beating of the gongs, screeching of
fiddles, blowing of norns and the ki-yi-ing
of tbe hired vocalists in the better classes
of restaurants.
The decorations so far to be seen are
few. In front of the josshouse are some
of those decorations that never fail to put I
one in mind of the inscriptions on chem
ists' bottles, and the flag gayly flies to the |
ureeze. â 
The camera fiend is in his element, and
persons wi'b sketchbooks are Ã¼biquitous.
Chinatown is always picturesque; even
when in a state of siege.
It is understood that the idea of re
straint binds bo heavily upon the swelling
sense of ceathen woe that the Chutes
have been chartered for a due celebration
of tne New Year festival.
One nundred more men went on duty as
a relief in the evening;. This system will
be kept up for tome time.
TEN MORE HIGHBINDERS.
Arrested With Nine Naw Revolvers
a Foot Long.
Nine black murderous-looking revolvers
and ten Chinamen, ail now in the Califor
nia-street police station, are more evidence
that society in Chinatown is still prepar
ing for warâ getting ready for more mur
der.
Another raid was made by the China
town squad last night led by Sergeant
Mconey and posse. It had been Jearned
tuat a quantity of firearms had been
bought during the afternoon, and the pur
chaser was traced to room 3 upstairs at 39
Washington alley.
The police knocked at the door of the
place which is a sort of Chinese club. It
was opened and all the inmates were placed
under arrest. Then a sea:ch wbs begun
for tue firearms. The. police found a
small <toor in one of the walls and broke
it down. It opened into a small room and
there the implements and munitions of
war were found. Tiey comprised one old
Colt revolver, and eight new ones, each in
a box as brought from the siore. ThÂ« re
volvers are 44 or 41 caliber, abont a foot
long and cave barrels 1% inches in
length.
The raid was made about 10 o'clock and
the names of the captives given at
the police station as they were lined up
were: Now Yen, Wong Ping, Fdng' Get,

ARE THEY THE MEN?
Wing Slngr and Chin Poy Booked
for the Murder of Little P te.
Wir.g Sing and Chin Poy, the Chinese
who were arrested by Polic-man Murty
Callinan shortly after Little Pete's mur
der and have been detained in the tanks
since, were formally charged with the
murder yesterday morning.
Tfco complaint was sworn to by Police
man E. C. Robinson 'before Judge Joach
imsen yesterday morning.
Ctiief Crowley said yesterday that he be
lieved they were the men who committed
ihe murder, but the evidence against them
is not yet complete. They were seen run
ning from the barbershop when the fatal
shots were fired, and the Chief believes
; that considerable important evidence will
I be availab.e for tne prosecution at the
I trial.
Ex- Judge Ferral, who has been retained
to assist the prosecution, expressed the
opinion that the investigation will lead to
the arrest of other Chinese implicated in
the plot to till Little Pete.
A Big Funeral Bill. '
The grand total of the various items of
expense incurred in the funeral of
"Little Pete" reaches the modest sum of
$1200.
The elaborate eaulpaee of a hearse and
six black horses furnished by N. Gray &
Co. was the costliest item.
The purchasing and roasting of fat hogs,
twenty-five juicy chickens, three tame
ducks, spices, etc., with a sack of rice and
a liberal quantity of tea to wasu the
viands down by "Pete" on his long jour
ney to his final destination, cost money.
In addition to those substantial articles
which were especially prepared for the
boss of the Sara Yud Company there
were 112 carriages provided by "Pete's"
heirs for the hundreds of his followers
wlio accompanied his remains to the
cemetery and bacs.
Ttie embalming bill foi the preserva
tion of his body until such time aÂ» it shall
be deposited among the bones of the
Foils Cfaiug family In the Jand of the
risin â¢ sun was another item of no small
magnitude.
PRICE GETS TEN YEARS.
Killed Hit Stepson With a Pair of Scis
sors Last October.
Judge Dunne has sentenced William J.
Price to ten years in the State Prison at
San Quentin lor stabbing and killing his
stepson E. J. Edgar. The prisoner was
convicted of manslaughter.
Judge Dunne lecounted the circum
stances of the case, the tesiimony show
ing that Price had been drunken and
quarrelsome lor a long time. On the Bth
of last October he went home drunker
and uglier than usual, and attacked his
wife in a brutal manner. Edgar appeared
from an adjoining room and attempted
to save his mother from a beating. The
young man's net incensed the drunken
man and taking up a pair of scissors he
stabbed his stepson over the heart, in
flicting a mortal wound. Edgar ran out
of the house and dropped uead in the
street.
In the opinion of the court the testi
mony was sufficient to have warranted a
verdict for murder in the second degree.
Because of this the extreme penalty for
manslaughter was imposed.
A Mutual Â».Â«ttiTy.
The charge against M. P. Light and Mrs.
Grodgen^, managers ol the Sunset Purchasing
Club, Murphy building, of running a lottery,

AN OLD STORY
IN A NEW FORM
The Fairy Tale "Aladdin"
Makes Its Bow at the
Tivoli.
Good Scenery and a Batch of
Sparkling Songs and
Dialogue.
Pretty Nearly All the Old - Time
Talent Hav^ a Place in tha
Pirformanc;.
Another season of the spectacular began
last night at the Tivoli, when "Aladdin"
made its bow to a crowded house. The
story of the operetta is as old as the fairies
themselves, but it conies this time with
new accessories and garnished with novel
flavor.
There are four acts in the Tivoli song
story and double that number of scenes.
There is the zest of originality in the dia
logue and the vocal part of the pro
gramme. Provision has been made to
introduce a vaudeville concert in the
third act, and the innovation has proved
a success. There is some very good scenery,
the effects in the cave, where Aladdin
finds the magic lamp, being elaborate and
startling.
Beyond the name and that the skeleton
of the old fairy story is seen in the back
ground in all the varying scenes and num
bers, "Aiadain" by any other name would
be just as good. Tne characters have been
maue to order to a great extent to suii the
available talent, and the workmanship is
of good order. The place of iun provider,
of course, falls to Ferris Hartman as Tip
poping. There is another cumedian part
winch belongs to Maurice D'Arcy. Alad
din, resplendent in silk tiyhts and yellow
silk pajamas, is Miss E.via Crox Sea
brooke.
John J. Raffael is cast as a real kitur,
the Khan of Xartary, who renders a solo
in the third act that is one of the best
efforts in the performance. Miss Anna
Schnabel is the Princess Lovesins, his
daughter, who is ultimately wooed and
won by Aladdin, much to Uie delight of
courtiers, servants, Turks, tailors and a
host of other people. The list grows with
lthys Thomas as Babajeet, a necromancer:
Arthur Boyce and W. H. 'looker as genii
and handy men generally; Fred Kava
nacb. the grotesque servant Hyson, and
Duncan Smith as Coupecoop, a coach
man.
-Miss Annie Suits is Niteo, the genius of
the lami), and in her vaudeville moments
a good imitation ot tlie girl from Paris.
Mi>s Bernice Holmes plays motner to
Aladdin. Miss Josie Intropodi has the
place or Coodove. The list is complete
with Miss Jennie Stockmeyer and Miss
Vera Werden as servants.
Tne show goes with a zing and a ring
and will undoubtedly make a hit. It has
only one fauit, not a bad one after all. It
is too long. It will stand pruning in the
interests of the last-cur contingent.
MRS. HELBING'S PLAINT.
Sues the Spring Valley Company for
Cutting Oft"' a Water Supply.
Mrs. Louise Helbing, by her attorney,
August Tilden, has sued tie Spring Val
ley Water Company for $:360 damages,
caused by the. company shutting off the
supply of water from her premises, 1708
Waller street,
Mb. Helbing alleges that on the 26th of
Jane, 1895, -he owe the water company
$3 and' no more, in accordance with the
requirements ot the City's water ordi
nance, but the company, demanded ?8.
ana when she declined to pay the extra $5
shut off the supply of water from the
premises.
While the water was thus shut off a fire
occurred, which would have been sub
dued if the water had been supplied to the
pipes in a proper way. For the loss of
property Mrs. Helbiug holds the water
company responsible and demands dam
ages accordingly.

908 Broadway, Jan. 30. |
This was the last day on which the
water companies can legally file their
statements upon which the City Council
must base the water rates for the coming j
year. Ten minutes before the Clerk's
office closed they were recorded.
There is always considerable interest at
tached 10 the reports on account of their
varying nature, and because of the great
discrepancies that, have previously ex
isted in the company's valuation! of their
respective properties when giving them
to the city, on which to fix their rates,
and when supplying them to the County
Assessor for the purpose of taxation.
When there was only one company its
self-estimated value as a basis for fixing
their revenue, which ;r>;;^t be done so as
to permit of an interest of 6 per cent on
trie investment, has been fixed as high as
$6.0000.000,
Ihe Oakland or Din.cc' 1 Water Company
filed a report of valuation and expenses as
follows: "

THE FRANCHISE BARRED.
Cannot Be Granted by a Council Going
Out of office.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 30.â The fran
chise applied for a week ago to run across
town will not be granted by the present
Council. Last ni^ht au application for a
withdrawal of the petition was filed with
the clerk stating several reasons for wish
ing to recall it.
Tbe letter of the applicant, J. J. Lamp
ing, is as follows:
To the Honorable the. Council of the City of
Oakland and the Ordinance and Judiciary Com
mittee thereofâ Gentlemen: I find that there is
a bill now in course 01 passage through the
Legislature changing and prescribing the
mode of granting street railroad franchises,
which is not in harmony with either
the charter of Oakland or the present
general law of 1893, and that it is Im
possible to compiete the proceedings
under the law, as it exists to-day, l>efo;e the
pending bill itself may become a law,* and
"tna't therefore the present proceedings might
be annulled by such new law and rendered
nugatory before completion. I therefore deem
it necessary to withdraw my present applica
tion (which I hereby do), and will await, the
action ol the Legislature upon tne street rail
roed bill now in course of passage there.
Thanking you for your consideration then'ior,
1 remain sincerely'yours, J- J- Lamping.
"Whether we shall renew the applica
t on or not," said Mr. Lamping to-clay,
"cannot be told at this time. It is certain
that we could not obtain a legal franchise
at present, and there is no knowing what
our opinion may be in a few months time.

result of the decision of tne doctors to

ment to be signed:
Whereas, Rendering professional services
at a stipulated lee per capita for any stated
time is opposed to the best interests of the
general public and the medical prolession,

ot Alaineda county, State ot California, enter
into the following agreement:
Firstâ We mutually, jointly and individ
ually pledge our word of honor not to outer

ten, verbal or implied, to render medical or
surj;icui services to any individual, laniily,

Â local corporation or organization, to
' extend beyond the 31st of December, 1897.
Second â We will not render medical or sur-
Kical services to the memb ts oi the abovo
i mentioned bodies for less compensfttiu'i than
! we charge the general public for similar scrv
j ices.

I crn boundary of Oakland and the southern.
Map Showing the Proposed Annexation and Three of the Men
Interested :n the Project.
boundary of Berkeley will be annexed to
this city. Next Wednesday evening a
meeting will bo held in the City Hall for
the purpose of forming a permanent
organization to carry out the desired end.
Many of the leading property-owners
have decided that the outlying districts
cannot be developed until they become a
part of the city of Oakland. Among thoa?
who are of this opinion are: George Mor
row of Temescal, Captain McMer.omy of
Golden Gate, Payne Shafter of Temescal,
J. Rea of Linda Vista, Edson Adams, Mr.
Montgomery and many others.
"Oakland at the present time suffers by
comparison with LO3 Angeles," said
George Morrow to-day. "There is some
civic pride in this matter of annexation.
Los Angeles takes in everything that 19
possible and poses before the country as a
city of 70,000 people. Oakland is looked
upon as being much smaller, and is talked
about aa being a city of 50,000 people.
This state of affairs should not exist, and
if we have our way will r.ot exist much
longer. The natural advantages of the
two cities are not to be compared, and
Oakland cannot nelp but grow. The
amount of taxable property that we wish
to add to the city of Oakland is assessed
for $6,500,000 at this time. After annexa
tion there will come an era of improve
ment, and the assessed value of the an
nexed property would at once increase,
and we should be the means of decreasing
general taxation, for we should not cost
the city as much aa we would pay in taxes*
"A glance at the map of this section of
the county shows that there is really no
dividing line between Oakland and this
large outlying district so fai as street rail
ways are concerned. There are three
roads which go through this territory and
ail unite at Fourteenth and Broadway,
right in the heart ot the city. These roads
bring the furthermost points of the terri
tory which we want annexed nearer
to the heart ot Oakland than the
city limits were ten years ago.
Every day there is an increased de
sire for annexation, and many people
who a few months ago were violently op
rosed to it. now favur the scheme. The
more the fact 3 are looked into the more
anxious are the property-owners io be
come a part of the city of Oakland. '
diaries A. Bon, the SaivFrancisco wine
merchant who resides at North Temescal,
is very ardent in his efforts toward annex
ation.
"This is a matter," he said, "in which
the people of Oakland need to be enlight
ened and interested. It would be a bene
fit to the whole community to take in this
territory, which is naturally a part of the
city. It includes Temescal, Golden Gate,
Peralta and Piedmont, and has a large
population, and there is no valid reason
to be advanced aguinst tha Greater Oak
land plan."-
The boundaries of the territory which it
is proposed toannez are as follows:
On the west by the eastern line of the
town of Emeryville, on the south by the
charter line of the city of Oakland, on the
east by the continuation of the eastern
line of the town of Berkeley, running
south to the city of Oakland, on the north
by the town of Berkeley.
Edson Adams, C. A. Scoville and Payne
Shafter have been apppinted a committee
to confer with tho=e property-owners who
are still in doubt as to the advisability of
annexation.

pubiicans ana in 1886 was elected City

FAVOR ANNEXATION.
Meeting of Thoge "Who Are Working for
a Greater Oakland.
OAKLAND, Cai., Jan. 30.â There wa?
an enthusiastic meeting last night in Judge
Cliffs courtroom of those who favor the
annexation to Oakland of all the outlying
districts north or the city. Charles Bon
was elected chairman and J. Naismith
secretary.
The sentiment was unanimous in favor
of annexation, and it was stated that
all the large property-owners favor it.
The chairman stated ttiat the assessed
value of the properly that is anxious for
annexation is $6 500.0U), and consists of
Golden Gate, a large portion of Peralta,
Piedmont and Temescal, and has a large
population.
Messrs. Edsor. Adams, C. A. Scoville
and Payne Shafter were appointed a com
mittee to confer with any who might ob
ject to annexation and to prove to them
that such action would lead to a reduc
tion of the taxes of the whole of "Greater
Oakland."
Next Wednesday evening there will be
a meeting of those favorable to annexa
tion at ihe City Hall and the movement
will be permanently organized.

Meeting.
University Politics in the Selection ci
a Leader of the Gridiron
Athletes.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 30.â N0 elec
tion of a football captain took place to
day at the university owing to the ab
sence of several members of the team.
The meeting was for the purpose of
navine the team photographed for
the Blue and Gold and to choose
a captain for the next season, and the
fact that four of the varsity eleven, all
"irat" men, did not snow up, is thought
to have some significance. Last year a
similar occurrence took place. The men
who stayed away to-day are Ransome,
Kennedy, Carr and McNutt. Carr is one
of the candidates for the placo that was to
have been filled, and tnose on the inside
are disposed to thinly that there was some
politics in the action of the men who did
not keep the appointment.
The- election was postponed to next
Saturday.

AFTER DIVORCE, LIBEL
A Berkeley Schoolteacher Will
Make a Fight for Her
Honor.
Her Friends in the Baptist Church
Say It Is All Due to Her
Husband.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,*
908 Broadway, Jan. 30. (
Mrs. Clara Elliot, a Berkeley school
teacher, has filed a complain: ior criminal
libel against Editor John Hanacom of the
Berkeley Gazette. The charge is the out
come of a divorce case in which Mrs. El*
Hot Spared as plaintiff a few weeks ago.
The article complained of appeared in
the Gazette of the 9th of January and is
of some length, and Mrs. Elliot takes the
greatest exception to the- following para
graphs:
As one side of a story is considered good un
til the other is told, there is a little more to
relate in the experience of Mrs. Elliot in mat
rimonial adventures. If our information is
correct there is a strong probability that she
will soon enter again iiito the business of mar
ried life, although two chapters iv this book
do not seem to have set her against It.
Her first adventure may not have been
enougn to fill tne aching void. Of that the
record as yet does not show, but of the second
it has assuredly not been an overwhelming
success. Naturally there la cause for it. Our
news-gatherer was informed that the young
lady, who is only of about 22 and
yet, as far as personal appearance may indi
cate, of several more winters, had transferred
her affections to ft young office-seeker oi West
Berkeley. In fact, ho iurther learned that the
young lady had also to resist the attentions of
a young butcher residing at, tue West Eud,
who never could lake an order in her back
yard In less than half an hour, and the bill
was nvvur sent in.
Mrs. Elliot is a prominent member of
tne Baptist church, and in her complaint
she says that she does not contemplate
matrimony; that she can produce receipts
from her butcher, and declares that her
actions were ever in accord with her re
lipious teachings.
The divorce case of the Elliots at
tracted some attention on account of the
part taken by a young girl named Rosa
who fell in love with Mr. Elliot, and to
whom he frequently wrote and gave pres
ents. Even after the girl was taken out
to the Beulah Home Elliot followed her,
and was frequently seen in the neighbor
hood until warned to ceased his attentions
to hÂ«r.
Mrs. Elliot is regarded In Berkeley as a
hiehly respectable woman, and her nu
merous friends resent the insinuations
against her character.

MURDERED BY AN
UNKNOWN HAND
Mrs. Maria Sprinznik Shot
to Dsath, Her Slayer
Escaping.
Her Lifeless Body Found by T.
Schroff, Who Notified
the Police.
Fran* Wolf, the Woman's Escort, Is
M ssing, and Hs Is Saspscted
of the Crime.
A mysterious and foul murder occurred
in a little three-room cottage in the rear
of 918 Montgomery street at about 5:45
o'clock last evening. Mrs. Marie
Sprinznik, a woman about 32 years .of
age, was found lying dead on the floor ol
her kitchen by Theodore Schroff, a gar
dener who occupied one of the rooms, at
5:50 p. M. The body was resting full
length in a pool of blood.
A ragged bullet-hole at the corner of the
woman's left eye. several black powder
burns on the distorted features and the
absence of any weapon with which the
deed might have been committed told the
story of a murder. Tne sound of the ahot
that ended the unfortunate woman's life
failed to reach the ears of her neighbors
and her slayer skulked quietly from the
scene of his crime and disappeared.
Mrs. Sprinznik was a married woman,
the wife of Franz Sprinznik, a tailor, who
occupies apartments at 622 Clay str.-er.
She left her husband about six months i
ago, and after casting about for a short
time met Franz Wolf, a man who earned
a livelihood laboring in an Alameda
County limekiln.
The friendship of the couple was soon
superseded by affection, and they went to
live in the cottage where the woman met
her death. Three days ago Schroff, who
found the body of the murdered woman,
rented one of the rooms. Night before I
last, according to his statements, the j
couple occupied the same room and ap- i
peared, judging irom their conversation,
the best of friends. Schroff left the house !
yesterday morning and went to Union I
Park, where he is employed.
At 2:30 p. m. Tommy Davis, a bright lad,
13 years of age, who resides with his
parents at 956 Montgomery street, noticed
Wolf leave his house. At 4 o'clock, an
hour and a half after Wolf departed, the
murdered woman was seen sweeping up
the stairway in front of her home.
She hnally entered her house, and was
not seen again alive. Schroff returned to
his room at 5:50 o'clock. The kitchen,
which is the first room entered through
the front door, was dark, and the unsus
pecting gardener walked almost up to the
dead body before he saw it.
When he saw the body he turned
and fled, alarming the neighborhood with
his shouts as he ran. Officer Dan Owens,
the once intended target or Mike Nolan,
with wnom he had a shooting scrape on
(â rant avenue a few months ago, heard
the gardener's shout and hurried to the
SLene. Finding that he had a murder on
his bands Owens whistled for Officer D. G. j
Bell and th6y returned to the Sprinznik
house.
Tne body was still warm, as was a flat
iron resting on an ironing-board a Jew 1
feet away, and blood was slowly oozing
fiom the outlet would in the head.
The Coroner's and Captain Lees' offices
were immediately notified, and in a snort
time Deputy Coroners Tyrreil and Mc-
Inne* and Detectives Dillon, Crockett. Bee
ar<i Seymour arrived on the scene.
Tue tody waj removed to the Morgue
ana the detectives besjan to study me
caÂ«e. After an hour's work they decided
that altnjQueh 'A'oif nad not been seen in
the neighborhood of the killing since 4
o'clock Jie must know something about
the murder. They searched for him, but
up to a late hour he had eluued capture.
Without doubt, Mrs. Sprinznik ex
re c ted trouble with borne of her acquaiai
ances.
Tuesday afternoon Mrs. Antone, who
resides on the ground floor of 916 Mont
gomery street, visited the murdered
woman. At that time Mrs. Sprinznit
told lier that there was a revolver Jaudcn
under the mattress on tier bed. The
murdered, woman asked Mrs. Antone to
remove tae cartridges, saying she was
afraid of firearms.
The matter was finally dropped, h6w
ever, and the pistol remained loaded. Last
evening when tne body was found, a
thorough search of the house failed to
bring tiie revolver to iiKht. Undoubtedly
the murderer used it, and after having
slain his victim put it in his pocket and
escaped.
The woman's husband, Franz Sprinz
nik, is a tailor and works and lives at 622
Clay street. He was, notified of the mur
der by Detective Seymour ana appeared
to be "grief str;cken at his wife's death.
He was taken befoie Captain Lees and

made a statpment aa to his wife's connec
tion with Wolf.
He said that, he and his wife, who was
about 32 years of age, were married seven
years ago. They both belonged to Styria,
in Austria. They came to this City, and
about eleven months ago, while living at
930 Harrison street, he became av*areof
the fact that Wolf and his wife were inti
mate and h: 1 separated from her. For the
past seven months Wolf and his wife had
been living together as man anri wife.
Two weeks ago she sent Schroff to him to
tell him that she wanted to live with turn
again, as AVoif was bea;ing her.
Sprinznik replied that she knew where
to find him and if she wanted 10 speak to
him she could come herself. He had not
seen her for the past three or four months.
The woman had about $70 in bans and
"Wolf was always trying to get her to give
him the money. Two weeks ago he gave
her a severe beating because she refused
to give n:m some money, blacking her
eyes. He went to Schroff, who was a
friend of Mrs. Sprinznik, and borrowed $o
from him. Mrs. Sprinznik told Schroff
that if Wolf did not pay back the $5 she
would.

INSURANCE MEN OBJECT.
The Assessment Insurance Men Say
the Proposed Legislation Is Un
desirable.
There are some bills now pending before
the Assembly on the subject of insurance
to which the assessment insurance men of
this City are strongly opposed and which
they claim are hostile to the public in
terests. They are numbers 122, 123 and
130. Their purpose is to amendthe act re
lating to insurance which was passed in
1891. This act was modeled on the best
insurance laws of ihe Eastern States, with
3ome modifications to meet the special
conditions of California, so say the in
surance men. Like all laws, after the
test of experience it was found to have
some defects, but it is claimed tuat the
amendments proposed do not remedy
these evils, but actually open the door for
evils to come in which would be effectually
barred by letting theold law stand as it is.
One of the deficiencies of the law of
1891 is that it does not provide any pen
alty for the violation of the requirement
that a sum equal to the largest policy is
sued by any corporation shall be depos
ited with the State Treasurer for the se
curity of the policy-holder. The report
of tne Insurance Commissioner, pub
lished in 1896, and covering the year 1.895,
shows that this provision of the law has
been disregarded. Some of the insurance
men think that the amendments needed
are tnat the Commissioner should be pro
vided with sufficient authority and suffi
cient money to enforce the law of 1891.
The objections pointed out by the oppo
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 31, 189 T.
nents of the proposed legislation are that
the general effect of the amendments be
fore the Assembly would be practically
prohibitory 10 tne formation of new as
sessment companies and that it would
prevent the extension of the business of
those companies already formed into
other StatC3.
Some of these companies do business in
Imanyoiher States and this greatiy adds
j to their resources. Owing to the provi
i sions of the bill the California Commis
! sioner could not give the companies Here
j the certificate necessary to enable them to
I do business in other Slates under the re
-1 ciprocity and retaliation laws which are
! common to most of the States.
Perhaps the strongest objection to the
bill is that it is purposed to permit the in
surance companies to invest their assets
in anything except mining stock. An
other of the tbree bills provides for the
registration of policies, the effect of which,
it is claimed, would be to deceive the
people into a feeling of security because
of the registration, when really the sup
posed safeguard put up might be worth
less stock, but made a lawful deposit by
the companion bill.
Yet another feature condemned is that
one of the bills requires that the appli
cants for insurance shall each put up a
pro rata of the $5000 deposit with the
Treasurer.
It is contended that this restriction will
make it much more difficult to organize
mutual companies, but will add nothing
whatever to the security of the policy
holders.
It is reported that the Insurance Com
mi.-sioner will recommend a bill which is
to be so drawn as to remedy the features
objected to by the assessment insurance
men.

HAWLEY SAYS THEY
ARE NOT TRUE
Takes Exceptions to the
Charges Made by R.
Peixotto.
Grapples Vigorously With the
Foreman of the Present
Grand Jury.
Figures Arrayed lo Shew How the
O.d B ard of Education Ex
pended Public Money.
Charles H. Hawley, chairman of the
Supply Committee of the Board of Educa
tion in 1895, and chairman of the Finance
Committee of the same board in 1896,
takes exception to the charges made by R.
Feixotto, foreman of the Grand Jury, con
cerning a waste of funds of the School
Department. Mr. Hawley has prepared a
statement, which is as follows:
The article published in the Examiner of
January 29 relating to the wasting of public
school funds is a slanderous misrepresenta
tion of facts and figures.
.Mr. Peixotto has not stepped his foot inside
the oflice of the Board of Education since he
became a member of the Grand Jury. The
Board of Education Committee of the Grand
Jury and its expert have made several visits,
and hnd they taken the trouble to investigate
both at the board and storeroom they would
not have made such a false report.
While <J. W. Colby has b.eu storekeeper and
Percy King his assistant for the School De
partment during the lnst administration. I
deiy Mr. Peixotto or any member of the Grand
Jury to prove where even one desk or a piece
of furniture has not been accounted fur and a
receipt shown for the same.
Mr. Peixotto in his article says; "The
record during the fiscal year 1895-96 shows
aiv expenditure of $28,038 70 for furniture.
The committee has been unable to find the
articles so purchased, and to cap the climax
not only the appropriation has disappeared,
but a deficit of $86,572 10 was created."
The lurniture uccouut on the books of the
board not only includes actual furniture
bought, but all supplies purchased by the Sup
ply Committee tor the use oi the department,
i xcept stationery and physical apparatus. If
a. so include* ail labor demands charged to
said committee.
Instead of a deficit of $80,571 16 there was
a surplus of 941.277 25 carried over from the
n>cÂ«l yenr 1893-iHi.
Mr. Peixotto says: "For permanent improve
ments there whs expended $38,887 97, for
erection of buildings $15,280 54, ior repairs
$25,40129. What the Grand Jury is particu
larly interested in knowinp is where are the
repairs, new buildings and permanent im
provements and new larniture for which the
late board says they paid out if 102,084: 50,
there being no school erected during the fiscal
year closed in June, 189(i."
For the information of Mr. Peixotto and the
Grand Jury 1 will give them a few facts and
figures which their expert should have found
out as they are a matter of record and very
easily obtained, I submit the following:
Furniture accountâ Total amount c iar;ed to ac

followins contracts were awarded and paid
for by the last board under permanent im
provement fund:
Building Bernal Heights School. $27.732 50;
sanitary closets, Columbia school, $4444 50: sani
tary c osets, etc., Harrison School. $5263 82; sani
lary clo<ets, Denman school, $H95: improve
ments, Cooper School. $10 211 77; improvements,
Longtellon- school, $3990; improvements, Lafay
ette School, $5781 30; whitfiiilnK and painting
schools, $12,866 2H. Total, $72,V!85 17.
In regard to the repair account, amounting
to $25,461 29, it would be Impossible forme
to give an itemized account oi said fund, as
the items are very numerous and the fund
was spent under the supervision of the Build
iug and Grounds Committee. The amount
spent on the Girls' High School laboratory is
under tne same committee.
The above will prove what a false report the
foreman of the Graud Jury has submitted to
the public, and I hope in his future reports
he will refrain from his slanderous remarks
about the last board until he can prove his
assertions. Keipecifully submitted,

REICHLING ESTATE.
Ex-Judge Davis Won His Point in Judge
Slack's Court Yesterday.
Ex-Judge Davis of Amador County ap
peared in Judge Slack's court yesierday
on behalf of the legatees under the will of
the late Louis F. Reichling and asked that
special letters of administration be granted
to George Goodman, who was named in
the will as one of the executors.
Attorney Adams on behalf of Albert
Reichlin^', a brother of the deceased, ob
jected to any such order. He said that
Albert Reichiing is more competent than
any other person to manage the business
of the estate.
Judge Slack said he recognized the fact
that the court could use its discretion and
there could be no relief to the losing party,
because the law did not permit the faking
of an appeal from such an order. Yet the
court would rule as Judge Coffey had de
cided in the matter 01 tue estate of Jean
nette Held, when it was said: "In mak
ing the appointment of a special adminis
trator the court must give preference to
the person entitled to letters testamentary
or of administration."
The court had no doubt that this is law,
and therefore Mr. Goodman was granted
special letters.
Large interests are at stake in the settle
ment of this estate, and it is quite proba
ble that there will be a contest among the
relatives before the $100,000 worth of prop
erty is distributed.
NATIVE SONGS TO ENTERTAIN.
A Grand Celebration of the Opening of
the Mason- Street Hall.
The Hall Association of the Native Sons
of the Golden West will, on February 11,
celebrate the first anniversary of the com
pleiion of it 3 new building on Mason
street, between Post and Geary, with a
grand entertainment and dance, to be
held in the large hall within the building.
Committees were appointed by the board
of directors at its last meeting to take the
arrangements in charge, and an extensive
and attractive programme has been pre
pared ior the evening. The entertain
ment will be made up of musical and lit
erary numbers, and the talent secured
consists of many of San Francisco's lead
ing artists.
The new building of the fraternity was
dedicated on Sunday, February 9, 1896.
and the grand baK, the opening event in
the large social hall, was held on the fol
lowing Tuesday evening. This was a
brilliant affair, and there were present the
grrand officers and a large gathering of
Native Sons, Native Daughters and their
friends. All the parlors of the iraternity
within the City are enlisted in the prep
arations lor tue anniversary celebration
and the close of the first year in the his
tory of the new building, which has been
a most successful period, will be fittingly
marked.
STOLE A DIAMOND PIN.
Frank Smith and Thomas Kackie i
Charged With Grand Larceny.
Frank Phillips, the well-known turf
man, was on a crowded car Friday even- j
ing going from the Ingleside track. Two
men pushed against him, and one of
them deftly extracted his diamond pin
from his scarf.
Phillips was aware of the theft and kept
his eye upon the two men. When the car
reached Twenty-ninth and Mission streets
the two mm jumped off and Phillips fol
lowed them. He met Policeman JUdner,
and told him of the theft, and EJner over
took and placed the two men under ar- j
rest. They gave the names of Thomas
Kackie and Frank Smith, Kacfeie being
the man who stole the pin.
A crowd gathered round the officer, and
the two prisoners and a man pushed up !
to Kackie, held his hand over his mouth, |
and Kackie, who had the pin in his mouih, j
passed it to him. The man who got the '
pin immediately handed it to Phillips, !
and begged him not to prosecute Kackie |
and Smith.
Edner took the two men to the Seven
teenth-street police station, and later they
were conveyed to the City Prison. Yes
terday morning they we're booked on the
chame of grand larceny.
Ancient Rome.

tion auditorium, Mason and Ellis streets, next i
Tuesday evening, by Professor (Jrossof the
University of the Padfic. The evening's sub- j
ject will be "Ancient Rome," and the lecture I
wi 11 be accompanied by mauy most excellent â 
stereopticon views. Professor Cross has had |
large audiences at his lectures in this course, i
and they have been extremely enjoyable and
helpful. The lecture on Rome will be one of
the very best of the course. The public is ad

HT*' 0 those survivors of the Civil War }
vK^ who endured months or years as
jl^ soldiers in the ranks in the service
of the United States army, and who were
familiar with the quality and type of
soldierbood at the period of the close of
hostilities, and whose regard for the army
moved them to maintain for it the interest
of an observer during the few years follow
ing their return to civil life, the army of .
to-day is as strange and remarkable as
4 ugn they had never known its exist
"â F The zone of soJdierhood in times of
â pÂ»ace in the army of past days was a sort
Vi reformatory. For the sake of its disci
pline it was upon it that the family of
any grade shed the wayward son; where
the abandoned fellow of good breeding
went to spue his kindred ; the jilted lover
to dismay his inamorita; there thousands
went to curb their appetites for strong
drink: and there, too, he whose past ex- |
ploits had rendered oblivion a state to be
preferred found the seclusion which he
sought. The ranks of the army teemed
with moral freaks, with the slough of in
dustry, with the "ne'er-do-weels," and
though, as in all large aggregations of in
dividuals, it contained many good men,
5 et by reason of the fact that its file? have
aiways been recruited through voluntary
enlistment, it had to take what happened
to be offered, and there have been periods
in our National history when the offerings
for military service were not of the best.
But the increase and long continuance j
ot hard times among the laboring classes j
has in recent years produced an enormous ,
change in the moral standard of the per
sonnel of the army's rank?. In those old â 
days, wh"n any man could come into the
great land-ocean of the West and pre
empt 160 acres of arable soil, work for the
adjoining farmer, wbo was glad to get a
neighbor, while he was waiting for the
growth of his first crop, or live through the
interval on the buffalo which roamed in
sight of his shackâ when such was the
condition the grade of the men who are ]
now filling up the ranks of the army were

Black Crow," tUe teacher, wishine to
gratily the curiosity of an interested vis
itor, exclaimed: "All the children who
speak French may stand up."
In response perhaps a dozen out of the
sixty children enrolled arose to their feet,
giving opportunity to study type, char
acter and history in each little face.
Among them Julie Ferrer, whose mother
is a laundress, was perhaps the most per
fect type of childish beauty. Another
who attracted particular attention was
Phiiiphena Miceau, the daughter of a
butcher. Her delicate, clear-cut face, sur
rounded by a mass of light hair combed
back with what seemed a natural pompa
dour effect, suggested a portrait of the
unfortunate Marie Antoinette.
"All who speak Italian may rise."
There was a rustle, a clatter of slates upon
desks, a quick movement of little feet, and
the number standing was largely in
creased. The most interesting of these
young Italians looked the visitor solemnly
in the face, with exnressive dark eyes, and
said her name was Vingenzie Cz'zgni.
When csked her age she replied, "I'm 6
an<P3over." Another child of the same
nationality, and who is acknowledged to
be the brightest in the department, ven
'iuired the information that her father was
-^"chrt man and found lots of things";
also, that "ne didn't give them back,
either."
The faces of those who responded to the
call for the children of Spanish parents
showed both .nlexican and Castilian
blood. These children are dreamy little
creatures, and the majority show less in
clination for study than those of other
races. Among them, however, was one
tiny tot wno se emed alert with energy.
Her exceedingly dark face, so small that
it couM be easily hidden by a man's palm,
showed her to be of Mexican parentage.
In watching her the thought occurred to
the visitor that to adherents of theosophy
the weird, small face if little Martha
f-;ilizar might prove an interesting point
in their belief; for, in spite of her babyish
manners, her expression at times sug
i the idea that here might be the re
incarnation of some ancient Aztec, who
hail experienced all the emotions which
ever stirred the human heart
The next call was for the Swedish chil
dren, and the number that rose to theii
sturdy feet showe-i Sweden to be well rep
resented in that particular grade.
Alter the little Swedes several Austrian
children arose.

eyr-p and a complexion in which the satiny

Â»<re snown, claimed to be Danish. Little

V i'ter and remarked: "We aie all going

Another child with fl;xen hair, large
eyes sei wide apart, a wide, full forehead

squareness looked eagerly at those stand

"What are you, Minnie?" she was asked,
but she did not seem to comprehend.
ond decade following. But with the dis
appearance of the free arable land and the
narrowing of opportunities for employ
ment the clusters of applicants around
the recruiting offices began to enlarge, and
they have since been growing. This re
dundancy of applicants permitted the Gov
ernment to raise the standard of qualifica
tions for enlistment and the multiplica
tion of its tests almost to the degree of
fastidiousness, while as the volume of the
unemployed became greater the drafts for
the army began to leave the multitude of
freaks and unskilled laborers and ascend
to those of skilled laborers, clerfcs and,
the greatest of all, the sons of farmers.
It is of these sturdy elements that the
soldiery of the army is now made up.
Freaks, et cetera, do still apply, but they
are rejected in the measured volume of
their application, so that of the number
of offers for enlistment at piesent but an
average of 10 per cent are deemed avail
able. During the month of December,
1896, there applied for enlistment at all
recruiting stations of the United States
3271 men. Of these but 329 were accepted,
while the rejected numbered 2942. As
this was a specimen month of the twelve
it might be estimated that there were
offered for enlistment in the army during
1896 about 39,252 men, of which "J3,304 were
rejected and only 3948 were accepted.
Such being the density of the surge
about the doors of the recruiting station
it can be esteemed that for one to secure
entry into the army of to-day is to
be regarded as an attainment and a suc
cess. The applicant must be between the
ages of 18 and 30, and physically sound,
he must stand in his stocKings 5 feet and 5
inches, must have a proportionate chest
measurement and weigh a designated
number of pounds. Xor is his high
register in his score of bodily points
sufficient for his admission; his moral
nature, his habits of industry, must be
certified to by persons of standing in his
community, and his mental reach is then
subjected to tests by a sort of civil service
j examination. He must liave a common
! school education, and unless his attain
i ments ol'the educational sort are deemed

adequate to fit him for the soldier's duties
he may become enlisted, but subsequently
and while at his post he will be detailed
by the captain of his company to attend
school. Five days in the week until re
lieved and between the hours of 1 and 4
must this instruction as a part of his duty
be attended. Not alone this, but instruc
tion of the strictly military sort is on two
days a vreek by the company captain
given him in technical school. Of the
varied exercises, which in these periods
he is taught, a lone list might be made.
His very textbooks comprise a compen
dious library of military learning. In
deed, every position, every movement of
the fcoldier when on duly, his stepping to
the right or to the left, the turning one
way or the other is noted in these books
ana comprises the pabulum for his medi
tations. The whole life of the man at
arms is in the literature of his craft, and
he pursues his occupation defined by the
most inflexible rules.
Thus is the army of the United States
to-day made up. It is the sturdy stock of
the country who are shouldering its rifles
and mounting its guards. Men of every
conceivable mochanical occupation and
many professional ones are among the
enlisted. Sergeant Dean of tiie Presidio is
a stonecutter; Sergeant Woliltman is a
cigar-maker; Private Best, who has
charge of the dynamite guns, is an elec
trician. At Angel island I talked with a
non-commissioned officer who had been
for years a sewing-machine agent; with
another who had been an insurance agent.
There are men by scores who have been
carpenters, painters, cabinet-makers, ma
chinists, blacksmiths, wood-carvers. At
the Presidio there is a soldier who has
graduated as a physician; another who
has a diploma from the University of
Ohio; while of the various forms of clerks
there is a multitude which it would be
tiresome to reckon. Ask those men why
they came into the army and they will
say: "'Well, times got too hard on the
outside to make an honest living and I
had to take the best opening I could
find."

Katelena Katrina is of Greek parentage â
a mother who goes out washing and a
father who is doubtless a fisherman; yet
should she reach womannood she will
possess one coveted gift, that of a
perfect face, according to accepted
rules of beauty. She replied to a question :
"I am Greet and a little American,"
the first: two years of his service; the
third year it is $16, the fourth $18, the fifth
$19. If he re-enlists it is $24, and for
every re-enlistment it is $1 per month ad
ditional. If he is made corporal he re
ceives $2 more; if sergeant $3, if first ser
geant $12 more. At the end of thirty
years of service he is retired on 75 per
cent of his pay and $7 50 per month for
rations. So that a soldier who enlists at
25 years of age would in his fifty -fifth year
be retired from the service with a monthly
stipend of say $35 or $420 year, equal to
interest at 5 per cent on $8400 of invested
capital.
In addition to all this the soldier is, of
course, clothed and fed, so that his wages
constitute his savings, and this he has no
need to touch; indeed, many men do not
touch it, but leave it undrawn in the
hands of the Government and are paid 4
per cent interest upon it. A man who did
not draw bis wages would at the
end of thirty years' service have
an accumulation of $4680, with per
haps enough interest to make the
sum a round $5000, which with his
pension would render him comfortably
well-to-do for the remainder of his years.
And as his course of army life is very
regular, his food most substantial, his
hours the most precise, this is all condu
cive to long life, so that when he retires
he is litely to have twenty or thirty years
yet to enjoy the benefits of hi 3 accumula
tions. If he becomes ill in the service he
receives the best of medical care, and if he
is disabled he is admitted to the Soldiers'
Home at Washineton, where he may lead
one of the most agreeable existences which
the ordinary mind can contemplate.
â¢ But tnere are other sources of income to
the soldier besides his wages. Unless he
is married and living with his family upon
the reservation each company messes to
gether; each man's allowance for rations
is spent for the common body, and to this
is added a dividend from the profits of the
post store, which formerly enriched a sut
ler, but who has been abolished
under regulations of recent years. Ti:e
food they are served very much surpasses
that of the ordinary mechanic's family.
thinking, doubtless, that a proper value
would be placed upon the latter declara
tion. Looking at the beauty ni the child
face (a fillet of faded ribbon bound about
her head made the resemblance to models
of ancient, Grecian beauties more striking)
we thought of Sappho, of Aspasia, both
famed for mental attainments as well as
beauty, and wondered if this child with
her Grecian face and American environ
At breakfast, fried potatoes, bread, butter
and coffee; at dinner, soup, roast beef,
vegetables, bread and butter, pudding;
supper, bologna sausage, fried potatoes,
bread, butter and coffee, with variations
of the menu throughout the week. They
sleep, a squad of six or more, in a well
ventilated room on iron bedsteads, with
comfortable mattresses and clean sheets.
They have baths and barbers, and the
sanitary fittings of the barracks building
surpass tnose of the average institutional
structure in civil life.
If the soldier is economical in the use
of his clothing he need not draw his full
allowance of apparel; the value of the
difference between what he draws and is
entitled to is paid him in cash. But be
sides this there is usually open to the
soldier employment upon the reservation
in the line of his trade. He may be a
company clerk or employed in the quar
termaster's department in carpentering,
painting or machine work and when
such is the case he is relieved from all
duty except i^rill on Tuesdays. For this
service he receives extra pay of 5Q cents
per day. There is a youn2 man at' Angel
Island who, under the superintendency of
the post chaplain, teaches the school.
For this agreeable service of three hours
per day he receives $15 extra per month;
this brings cis pay up to $28 per month
and found. It is doubtfui if he couid
secure in civil life employment where he
could with less work clear more money
above his expenses with the certainty of
steady employment the year around than
in tiie army.
The soldier rises at 6:25, breakfasts at
6:40. There is a drill at 7 :30, and at 8:45
there is dress parade. Except on instruc
tion days this about completes his usual
duties. At 12 o'clock the day's work is
done and he is oft duty except a few min
utes at sundown, when retreat is sounded;
then all hands report their presence and
the tlag is hauled down at the cannon's
shot. An exception is made to this
regime of the average day when he mounts
guard. This service falls to him a few
times a month, when he must in shifts
stand sentry duty daring the twenty-four
ments and opportunities might not in
spite of her humble parentage attain to
celebrity by face or gifts in this iand of the
West.
After the more numerous representa
tives of foreign nations had risen to their
feet three" little girls remained sitting.
One of these, very tidy in appearance, had
a broad, amiable face, plentifully sprinkled
with freckles. She was born in Ireland
hours, as at all posts a guard mount is
always maintained.
Aside from this the life of the soldier is
one of leisure and pleasure. He smokes,
converses, read books, magazines, plays
cards, billiards, poors, roulette, visits the
City, and if he Is at Angel Island he at
tends once or twice a week a magic lan
tern exhibition given by Captain Hum
phries. Sometimes there is a company
minstrel show on the island, in which
Private Webb of H battery, who was once
an end man of Primrose, Thatcher & West,
is the leading spirit. At other times there
are balls and entertainments at Alcatraz,
the Presidio and l^ert Mason, to which a
night boat is specially run. Much of his
time during t6e afternoon is spent in ath
letic exercises. For from fifteen to twenty
minutes each day it is his duty to so exer
cise. One day of every month is set aside
as a field day, when a programme is pre
pared and a committee of officers award
prizes to successful competitors.
It can be seen that the duties of the sol
dier of to-day call upon his intelligence
more man upon his physical powers.
This has* come about through the intro
duction into the service of high-power
guns, of complex implements of war.
Even the Krag-Jorgensen rifle, now in
use, is an affair which needs an intelligent
man to handle, while the degree of men
tal equipment required of the man in the
artillery service demands a high grade or
type of the genus homo to provide it.
The technical instruction of the heavy
artilleryman ircludes exercises with the
azimuth instruments, the transit theodo
lite and studies of their parts and plates,
together with the perusal of such works as
Rodgers' tables, Whistler's Graphic ta
bles and other authorities, besides courses

about tackle and the making of all known
knots.
The opening of a way from the ranks to
a commissioned officer â a recent change
in the law â has also drawn into the army
many high-grade aspiring men, who, hav
ing been unable to secure the influence of
a Congressman and appointment to West
Point, take this means to work their way
and had lived in this country Just one
year. Another was little Dora Mayne, the
only child of purely American parentage
among the number enrolled in the grade.
The third childâ mistaken for Mexican
because of her duaky face and hairâ proved
to be descended from California's primi
tive and earliest inhabitants. She is
called Mary Saunders and is a little waif
who was tossed from one charitable insti
into officerhood, which they may do
through study. The morale o f the army is
strictly guarded, and if any ruan should
so demean himself as to dis race his com
pany he would D 8 promptly reported to
the captain and either court-martialed or
ignominiously dismissed.
Most of me harsli punishments have
also been abolished from the army, it be
ing reooenized that there is no longer
need of them; for the worst punishment
of them all has come to be a dishonorable
discharge from the service. And this may
be made upon the peremptory order of a
company captain. The reward for the re
covery of a deserter has been reduced from
$60 to $10, and it is a standing maxim of
the army that "that there was never yet a
deserter worth $10." If a man deserts he
need not be alarmed that any blosdhound
hunt will be made for him. But there is
no need of any one deserting. If he wishes
to leave the service lie may, at
the end of two years, buy his
way out with $120, a sum which is re
duced $5 every succeeding month he re
mains with the army. When he is dis
charged he is given one day's pay and
30 cents for rations for every twenty milea
cf travel to his home, about twice as much
as his expenses in getting to his destina
tion. In short, the scheme of the War
Department at piesent is to take citizens
from ciyil life and educate them to be sol
diers, so that when they return to civil
life, as most of them do, there may be
among the body of the community trained
soldiers capable when called upon of de
fending their country and this without
the necessity of maintaining an immense
standing army. It is, therefore, for deal
ing with citizens, not abnormalities or
refugees, that the plane of soldierhood in
the army is to-day adjusted; and this
has nad its measure of influence in form
ing the type of soldier of the United
States who exists in the year 1897.

â¢^"Hk,? nois has a family which runs up
>5"5.v in years lite the rounds in a step
iadder. The heads of tne children when
standing in a row make a series of
steps equal in number to those which
lead into his stone house in "Washington
boulevard, says the Chicago Times- Herald.
The right of the line is held by the first
son. Then there is a bunch of three girls.
This brings the height down to the num
ber of inches claimed by papa, and two
boys cciue about to his shoulder. The
ninth child is a boyâ a bit taller than
pa's kneeâ the sixth and eighth bavin?
died some years ago. The big son likes
law, the three girls like music, the two
boys like skates and the baby likes
chickens.
Men who know Mr. Masonâ and every
body must now forget tiie other titles and
call him mister â are not surprised at his
home. All the people in it inherit his na
ture and inherit ail the graces of the
mother. There is a corner on sunshine
under his vine and fie tree. Fa pa plays
the hand-organ, Lewis plays the fluie,
Ethel plays the piano, Ruth plays the vio
lin. Winifred plays the guitar. Willie
pls.ys the mandolin, Rod plays the banjo
and Lowell plays anything he ran get his
hands on. This is the Mason orchestra,
and it appears as often as papa gets in
from tbe stump, or as frequently as it ap
pears that the neighborhood will siand it

and not make protest. This is the only
way the household has to make life a real,
sensible, satisfying joke.
Papa is notjbetter fun in any man's home
than he is in his own. Mrs. Mason will
tell yon this. It is insisted by both that
they were married because they concluded
they had the right idea on home and were
to join hands in makiue a home whicb
would be more than four walls ana a
place to fro to when everything else was
closed up. He was as poor as Job's turkey
when he asked Edith M. White in Das
Moines to De Mrs. Mason. He had noth
ine but confidence in himseif, and he had
somehow â as men have a habit of doing â
led Miss White to think tha sun rose and
set on him. He had been a schoolteacher,
but he predicted that the country would
hear from him. He said he would be a
good husband â as men have a habit of
saying lv advance â and he meant it.
Papa did not do much besides getting
his name in the directory for a long time
after he came to Chicago. He lived in a
cozy flat â all flats are CTzy in the adver
tisementsâwith four or five rooms and a
pleasant, "sunny" bedroom looking out
against a dead wall painted white. He
was doing court reporting and spending
his evenings reading jokes irom the joke
books. Mrs. Mason dirt not see exactly
what bearings the jokes had on the future
or how tney were to neure in making the
country hear from the man she had mar
ried because she loved him. Papa studied
law wi.en he had time, and one day the
town was electrified â not â by noticing the
sign of a law firm of which Mason was
the junior partner and a man equally new
the senior partner.
It was along about this time that papa
was first called papa, and a son came to
help papa's jokes light up the sunny beti
room â with one window looking out upon
the broad and white dead wall. Mrs.
Mason kept a stout and confident heart
because she jad believed what papa said
when ti:ey sat huddled up on the sofa out
in Dcs Moines â one of those sofas where
there is always plenty of room in the day
time for six and barely space tor two when
the lights are low and the moon sifts a soft
glar-i through the curtains and the head
of the household is sleeping upstairs. Mrs.
Mason kept papa working /or fame, and
there came a chance to go into politics.
This was the change for the jokes and ora
tory, and papa went on the stump.
Illinois iiad never heard anything like
it. He talked in all the schoolhouses,
town halls, iodgerooms andmeetin' houses
from Pecatonica to Peru and crosswise,
and slipped back to town to talk it over
with Mrs. Mason and jump the one, two
or three babies on his knee. ThSVe was
no uiace like home. It was the encour
agement he got, at these visits that made
the inspiration, and when out in the mud
and slush of Egypt he shut his eyes and
kissed other people's babies because he
lound under each roof that he visited one,
two, three or four big enough or little
enough to remind him of some one of his
interesting circle in the big city which
was just beginning to know him and his
per.-istency. The Saturdays and Sundays
at home he taught his family the game of
politics, and it thereupon happens that
the mother, the boys and the girls in it
know the State leader as "Clarice of Mat
loon, or Cannon of Danville."
Papa came to the hardest and most im
portant tight in his life, and, following out
the plan of other years, he wanted Mrs.
Mason close at nana for advice and inspira
tion. She went to Springfisld. The girls
wanted to go, too. They had helped tix
up the list of delegates, and knew all
about the preferences of the men from the
country districts. There are a lot of small
children â or at least smaller children than
the big girlsâ and so they were compelled
to stay home and keep house. This is the
way papa and bis family get alone They
all work logether. Papa is the king, and
all the other eight are the king's men and
tne king's ladies. It is always papa against
the world, and hurrah for papa! United
they stand; division brings tearsâ the
sort of division which took Lawrence and
Edith in their infancy.
Papa took Lewis with him, Lewis being
a young man and the confidential lieuten
ant in the long struggle. He is 22 and a
lawyer fresh from the Kent school. Ethel
was left at home because she is the dean
of the girls and therefore successor Of
Mrs. Mason in the rule of the home. She
is 20. Ruth was too busy at the Weft
Division High School and she watched
the battle irom afar. She could not stand
it and one day called papa up by 'phone
just to see how things were progressing
and to get changes for her list of papa's
men. She is 18. Winifred comes next.
Si c is 14 and an amateur photographer.
Wiliiam is like his father, whose name he
bears, and he has been on the scene of
battle for two wee Us. William has his
eye on the Presidency.
Papa likes Roderick because Roderick is
8 and more fun tnan a barrel of monkeys.
Lowell is 3% and is making his beginning
speeches frum the top of the htghchair.
His lungs are marvelous â just like papa's.
Ha and papa both play the hand organ
and have a mouth organ between them.
This completes the personnel of the
household, the full names of all the chil
dren being:

ETHEL WIN SLOW MASON,

Papa has lived in his handsome home
at the edge of Garfield Park for six years.
It is probably worth $30,000. It is in one
of the aristocratic neighborhoods, and
there are but few better in Washington
boulevard. There is a choice library,
many fine pictures and all the other
equipments of a home like papa's, and
homes like papa's are the best on earth.
Tnere is great joy in the house at this
time, and all those left at home are busy
teliing the neighbors how it happened
and answering telegrams for papa, bring
ing congratulations from friends in Wash
ington and every place else.
Papa has an album filled with all kinds
of pictures of his family. The group
shown in the picture reproduced with this
article was taken from this album, and
shows the family as it stood in 1890, when
papa was Congressman. The place on the
end should now be taken by Lowell, who
dates since the photograph was taken.
Lawrence, the second from the end, died
in Washington. The snap-shot picture is
of Roderick feeding the chickens while
spending the summer in Patterson, N. Y.
It was made by Ethel and Ruth, who had
the camera as a present from papa.

Sports of Bird, Beast and Insectâ JKeir Frolics ar\d Their
Qamesâ Some Animals With Solemn Ideas of Fun,
and Others . Brimming Ov>er With Qleefulness
(â â ^LIMBING among the bills, this
ilybrs morning, I came suddenly, in a field
W**,' Bkirting an upland orchard, upon a
vast flock of goldfinches. As a matter of
fact, I never before saw qu#e such an as
semblage of small birds. There ranst
have been a thousand of the feathered
morsels, teeterine upon tall grassblades,
hanging, head downward from the dried
stalks of !a-t year's thistles, swinging on
the full-flowered mustard, never still any
where â the goldfinch rarely is still.
Upon my approach they arose in the air,
fairly darkening the sky, and settled upon
the bare branches of the Iruit-trees just
over the fence. It was as if the orchard
had suddenly burst into a mass of yellow
blossoms. Twittering there on the bare
limbs, the little creatures really looked
more like flowers than birds.
I sank upon the grass and watched them
in delight. They were in ail states of plum
age, but comparatively few had their fall
spring suit of yeilow and olive, black and
white, and these shone bravely among
tneir soberer-hued fellows.
As soon as I became quiet a few yenÂ»
tured down to the thistles again, and
presently the flock was pouring earth
ward, jumping, tumbling, spilling â it
fairly rained goldfinches ali. about me. I
could almost have pat my hands upon
one or two venturesome sprites who
swung close beside me; but I sat motion
less, knowing that to stir would be to see
the wcole flock speed away.
But what a good time they were having!
Every now and then something would
happen io set them off in a twitter of fun.
The thistle-stalk where two swung sud
denly broke and the whole congregation
burst into a chorus of derisive cries that
sounded like per-CUickl per-chick-ee! de
livered upon the wing as they balanced
about, flying with a little quick, soaring
motion, in a sort of waved line that is
characteristic of this bird.
It did not take much to throw them in
to convulsions of glee, any more tpfan it
does a crowd of schoolboys or a band of
young colts. The crowing of a cock in
a barnyard below sent the flock into per
fect shrieks of ornithological laughtt-r,
ana they had any number of jokes among
themselves. They laughed at the blue sky
arching above, at the green biilo'.vs rolling
away down the hiJis, and their golden
mirth filled all the space between. Their
performance was no:hing unusual in bird
doings. They were young, and I suppose
everything looked funny to them, just a3
it does to all youth and innocence. Stu
dents of natural history tell us that not
even young hyenas play, and the ant, of
whom the wise man bids the sluggard
learn, ha.% no moments of recreation, but
with these exceptions all the dumb crea
tures have their ideas of sport, and enter
into it with the zest and abandon of young
children. The birds in particular are full
of play. Tbej uncos that come about my
door for their daily bread play a game
among the willows that is singularly like
the children's earns of tag. They start
with a rush from the upper bank of the
canyon, dodging and twisting among the
trees until \ne who seems purposeiy to
have lagged behind suddenly swoops down
and overtakes one among the throng, who
in turn falls back while the others tret a
little start, and then fiees in pursuit.
Only a day or two ago I came upon a
red-headed woodpecker drilling a hole
in a redwood tree. He flew off as I came
near and I stopped to examine his work.
I had never before seen it at just that
stage of incompleteness, and the cutting

looked wonderfully as though it were done
with a tiny ax. But what was the fellow
making it for? No woodpecker In his
senses would dream of building a nest in
such a place. Not two feet from the ground
and close upon a well-worn trail! More
over, there were no less than nine com
pleted holes, ail in a row, above this one
which he had just begun, and from eight
Inches to two or three feet apart. John
Burroughs tells of an energetic wood
pecker of his acquaintance who, having
made his neat and estab.L-hed his mate
thereon, amused himself while she sat
upon the eggs, by boring a dozen or more
holes through a bit of pine board. My
own observations of this bird have led
me to the belief that this incessant woods
man's trick of his is his form of recreation
by which he seeks relaxation from the
serious business of being a bird. Thus
Mr. Gladstone recreates his mind from
the care 3of state. Why should not the
woodpecker?
The ground-squirrel has a peculiarly
solemn idea of fun. I have ?een lour or
live sally forth together, mount different
stones and stand erect and motionless,
their queer little arms extended. They
will remain thus by the dour, and, as near
as I have been able to judge, watching
them at close range through the h'eid
glass, without moving a whisker, yet
wearing all the while the funniest expres
sion of demure gratification over their
performance. They have other sports,
and, like the juncoa, indulge in apparently
interminable games of tag among the
stones and hillocts, but this whimsy for
posturing seems to be their favorite pas
time, as playing at church is a fond amuse
ment with some children. Young lambs
have regular games which they conduct
with great precision. They are particu
larly fond of playing a game that would
be dear to the heart of any well-regulated
boy. One sturdy fellow will take posses
sion of a little hillock or rocky eminence
in the field, and, to all appearances, chal
lenge his fellows to dispossess him. The
challenge never goes without takers, and
usually half a dozen or more set out to
storm the fort, which the champion de
fends with great valor. Sometimes he
makes a very strong defense, and holds
his position for a long time against great
odds, but sooner or later he is forced back,
and whoever gains the top has to main
tain it against other comers. There is
always a great shaking of tails and much
kicking up of heels in this mimic warfare,
which attests to its entire good nature,
and the spectacle is both interesting and
funny.
There are no quainter or morefun-loving
creatures in the world than young pigs and
none fonder of play than horses, old or
young. Lacking their own kind to play with
they will enter into the games of human
companions almost as freely and quite as
cleverly as dogs do. I have seen a horse
play at hide-and-seek with a group of
children, and saw, recently, a mischievous
colt keep a couple of boys in a tree for
neailv an hour, making feints at their
danglinÃ legs and kicking up its heels in
manifest glee. When, at last, the boys
defied their captor and came down, the
colt simply trotted about them aa one
who would say: "Why didn't you do
that before?"
A few weeks ago I saw a grown cat, a
huge Maltese, having a sort of hulking
schoolboy fun at the expense of a kitten.
The kit was very small, but every bit there
was of him was mad. Back, head and
tail were ud, and he was retreating, eyes
to the front, and with a very creditable
show of dignity, from the presence which
he evidently hated, but dared not attack.
Biand and serene, smiling as only a cat
can smile, Tom lay quietly watching the
kitten until the latter bad got a little
distance away. Then he arose. The Kit
ten stopped and stood at defense. Kot to
preserve its whiskers would it. run, but
Tom merely approached and again lay
down, lazy and smiling, to enjoy the fun,
while the small furry fury continued its
retreat. Three times he did this, and only
ceased the teasing performauce when his
master called him away.
Even spiders, the most solitary and un
companionable of creatures, play, drop
ping down upon their silken thread?, run
ning back and forth upon their webs, un
mistakably taking recreation. Who has
not seen of a summer evening a swift
hawk swinging afar through the sky, dip
ping, swerving, circling, then on motion
less wings sailing straight away toward
the horizon, not in search of prey, but in
the pure joy of motion, playing up there
in the ethereal freedom?
Happiness, joy in existence, is the nat
ural heritage of every creature. We hu
mans have little remaining of it, because
most of us have sold Â»ur birthright for a
mess of pottage, oftener yet for the dry
husks of that which we mistakenly call
life. Even our relaxations are mere postur
ing, from which we get not even as much
pleasure as the ground-squirrel derives
from his queer pulpiteering.
"Poor human nature," we say, and talk
piously of "higher things than happi
ness." I tell you happiness is one of the
high things of this life of ours. "We may
always be sure, whatever we are doing,
that we ctÂ»nnot be pleasing Him if we are
not happy ourselves."
IrVing Wer\t to Sleep.
The venerable John H. B. Latrobe tells
me, writes Dr. Johr Morris in the Balti
more Sun, that In 1832 Mr. Irving paid a
visit to Baltimore and was the guest of
the Hon. Louis McLane, the father of- the
Hon. Robert M. McLane. ex-Minister to
France. Mr. Latrobe arranged a dinner
party in honor of Mr. Irving. He invited
the elite of the city to meet the distin
guished author. Amone the invited were
such well-known people of the day as
Johh P. Kennedy, Charles D'enro Hoffman,
both authors; Christopher Hughes (Kit
Hughes), Charles Carroll (father of Gover
nor Carroll), Mr. Bonaparte and many
ladies well known at. that time.
Mr. Irving led Mrs. Latrobe into the
dining-room, and sat on her right. Mrs.
Latrobe was a very beautiful woman and
Mr. Irving, up to a certain point, appeared
to De charmed with her beauty and grace.
However, her graces and beauty must
have palled, for before the dinner was
over Mr. Irving went fast asleep. The
members of the dinner party, who. of
course, kept their eyes fixed on Mr. Irv- ,
ing, discovered simultaneously that their
hero was noddingâ a sincere, earnest,
heavy nod. A general smile pasted
around among the assembled guests.
There were routs in those days, but our
people were too polite to carry off the

Eventful and Varied Gareer in Sol

J4ut at Phoenix
PfHCE NIX, Ariz., Jan. 28, 1897.â The
f ingratitude of republics has no bet-
ter example than that afforded by |
the case of Colonel Charles D. Poston in I
this city. His is a melancholy instance â
the closing of a long life of public service
almost in solitude, entirely in poverty,
amid scenes of squalor, in a wretched
adobe hut on the outskirts of the capital
city of the Territory that owes to his en
erey and daring no small degree of its
present fame and prosperity.
Charles D. Poston â the name has an un
familiar sound to tne present generation.
And yet so noted a man as Whitelaw Reid
drew rein before the humble adobe hut
one day last week. The ragged neighbor
hood marveled to see the stylish equipage
and none guessed that the seedy old man
who crossed palms with the great editor
had played even a larger part in the making
of history. For the neighborhood is Mexi
can and the old man lives in such seclu
sion that many of the Caucasian inhabi
tants scarcely know of his existence. But
the whole Territory wears on the tip of its
tongue the information that Whitelaw
Reid has bis winter residence in Salt
River Valley. And now that the incident
Is over and the two great men have met â
though one was in shining effluence, the
other in dull penury â Den remember it
to tha lasting credit of Whitelaw Reid,
that he could lose sight of his own great
ness in paying tribute to the genius of one
whose life has almost gone oat.
When I pushed open the rude gate yes

ing the night. Colonel Poston explained
apologetically that the Mexican had b?en
forming the nucleus of an indigenous zo
ological collection.
"I let him keep his pets in the yard
here," said the colonel, "but last night
some one liberated all of them and now
he is ruined."
At the far end of the yard is a long low
adobe house, all but one small room of
which is tenanted by weaving spiders in
wintertime and by tarantulas on the hot
days. That single tiny room is at once
the Kitchen and boudoir of Arizona's first
Congressman â a learned, cultured gentla
man, lawyer, traveler, author, explorer,
soldier. His reception-room is larger. .It
takes in the whole yard. Ana, sitting
here in the afternoon sunlight, Colonel
Poston smoked his pipe and explained â
what everybody else in the Territory has
been explaining for ten days past â that the
recent wet weather is the most remark
able thing in the known history of Ari
zona winters. Only the information
comes with better grace from Colonel Pos
ton, for he speaks with a larger knowl
edge; and ii carries more of conviction,
for the colonel has no corner lots to sell.
The last years of three-quarters of a cen
tury are closing on the life of Colonel
Poston, who might, with due regard for
the eternal fitness of things, be called the
father of Arizona. He came here in the
fifties, when 50,000 wild Indians roamed at
will over the Territory, and it 3 only white
inhabitants were h handful of settlers
scattered on the banks o. the Gila.
He was born in liardin County, Ky., in
April of 1825. At 12 years of age he was
placed in the County Clerk's office, where
he remained for seven years. Here he
learned the rudiments of the profession
that became his vocation, when ten years
later at Nashville he was admitted to the
practice of law by the Supreme Court of
Tennessee.
But the law was not to claim him en
tirely, and the acquirement of a fortune
was not his highest ambition. When tne
United States gained California he joined
the argonauts and came overland to the
Golden State. In 1850 he arrived in San
Francisco and was honored at once with a
first-class clerkship in the Custom-house.
He served four years in this position,
which fact alone entitles him to much
fame in San Franciscoâ particularly from
the Iroquois bravesâ as having served in
the Custom-house before the advent of
Jerome.
When the treaty between the United
States and Mexico for the purchase of
Arizona was concluded Colonel Poston
headed a band of thirty adventurous souls
who set out to explore the new Territory.
They embarked at San Francisco and ar
rived at Guaymas in January, 1854.
Through Chihuahua and Sonora, up iuio
Uncle Sam's new Ei Dorado, marched the
explorers. After examining the Territory
and taking specimens of its mineral
wealth, Colonel Poston returned to Cali
fornia, and thence across the isthmus
to New York, Philadelphia and Washing
ton. He spent the year 1855 on the At
lantic seaboards enlisting interest for the
new possessions. In the following yea
be came back to Arizona, bringing with
him a big company and funds for opening
the silver mines. This was dangerous
work iD those days, for the Apaches were
untamed and the Federal troops were few
and far between posts. Two years later
General Heintzelman, the president of
toe company, came out and relieved
Colonel Poston for a season, but when the
Civil W r ar broke out Poston was in charge
of the company's business in Arizona,
with a plant that cost a million doiliirs.
Now the few troops were withdrawn for
more important service, and the Mexicans
and the warring Indians made sad havoc
of things in Arizona. Colonel Poston left
the country in ruins ana crossed the con
tinent with.only one companion. Professor
Pumpelly. Repairing to Washington
Poston served on the staff of his old
friend, General Heintzelman.
In 1863 President Lincoln appointed
Poston Superintendent of Indian Affairs
for Arizona, and upon the organization of
civil government in the Terr 'ory he was
eiected as the first delegate to Congress.
After his term in Congress Colonel Pos^
ton made a tour of Europe, and after the*
Paris Exposition of 1867 he wrote ''Eu
rope in Sunimer-Time," a book that once
had a large sale and was numbered among
standard volumes. Returning to Wash
ington he resumed the practice of law in
partnership with Judge Botts of Califor
nia. At the time of the Burlingame Chi
nese embassy Mr. Seward commissioned
him to visit Asia in the ostensible interest
of immigration and irrigation, and he was
also especially commissioned to bear dis
patches from the Chinese embassy to the
Emperor of Chins.
One of President Grant's last official
acts was to appoint Colonel Poston Regis
ter of the Land Office in Arizona and, like
an Arab, he returne 1 to the desert and
was lost to sight for ten years. In after
years he served as consular agent at No
pales, Mex., then as military agent at EL
Paso. Subsequent to this he devoted sev
eral years to promoting measures for the
reclamation of the arid land* of the West
by National irrigation. In 1890 he was ap
pointed agent of ttie Department of Agri
culture at Phoenix. JBut now he has
almost outlived his usefulness. He has
neither fortune, position nor pension. He
is a member of the Society of the Sons of
the American Revolution, president of
the Arizona Historical Society, councilor of
American Institute of Civics, and a whole
lot of other things that are entirely Hon
orary. He has long since been a widower.
He has a grandson at Stanford University
and another in San Francisco. His only
daughter is married to a sergeant in the
barracks on Angel Island. He has, in
truth, enough to eat and drink and smoke.
He has a calm conscience and a aseful
past that is not unpleasant to co%em
plate. Hia body is not so vigorous asv-.t
once was, though the real man within
him is as keen and active, perhaps, J^i
ever. He was telling me about the ruins
and strange things of Arizona, and the
conversation drifted from the petniied re
mains of th<j cliff dwellers to the primi
tive crematories of the Yuma Indians.
"The first cremation I ever saw," he
said, "was in ISSB on the banka of the
Colorado River, just above Yum a. The
next one I saw waa on the banks of the
Ganges in 1867."
"Were they the same?"
"As to smell, yes; 1 couldn't tell the
difference."
".But were the methods of cremation the
same?" I asked.
"Not exactly. On the Ganges, where
fuel is scarce, several bodies are disposed
of at once. On the Colorado, where fuel U
plentiful, they build a separate bontire
for each corpse."
He is a bright and entertaining conver
sationalist, bu. he seldom talks now. Ha
sits out here in the sunshine, under the
wonderful Arizona skies, and thinks and

Fell Out With His Wife, Denounced the Preacher, and Worried
Himself Sick OVer a Trifling Jask That
Floored Him
TrT^AST Sunday morning Mr. Wiggins
J^: of teenth street rose benign and
lam*} smiliug. He had bought some cur
tains on Saturday, and having decided to
hang them himself felt like a certain
"smart Alick" of old with a new world to
conquer.
"Hurry up the work, Susan," he said
niter breakfast, "so we won't be late to
church. A trifling job like this won't take
me half an hour, and I'll have 'em up
while you're washing the dishes." And
then he went down into the basement.
"I say," he called presently, "Where's
the step-ladder?"
"Over at the minister's," answered his
wife. "You lent it to them on Thursday
and they haven't pot through with it.
They're papering, you know."
"I don't either," retorted Mr. Wiggins
wrathfully. "I ain't no Dorcas Society to
keep track of all the neighbors are doing.
â \\ hatever fool thing they are up to.though,
they oueht to send a person's property
back before it drops to pieces with
old age. I should just like to know for
idle curiosity how you expect me to put
them things up without a step-ladder. I
ain't the celebrated Chinese giant, nor yet
a telegraph pole."
"You might so over and tell them you
â want to use it," suggested Mrs. Wiggins.
"Of course I m'igbt," interrupted her
husband, "and I might hire the town
crier, if there was one, to inform the pub
lic that I am going to break the holy
Sabbath by putting up curtains, but I
won't. I'll rig up some kind of a tower of
Bab*l out of coal-scuttles and bootjacks
and toothpicks and things, and if I break
my neck don't you let that minister
preach over me, for it will be his fault and
my blood will be on his head. And I
w;int it understood right here ana now
that the next time I want to use my own
step-ladderâ bought with my own hard
earningsâ and it ain't on this reservation,
there's going to be a row â a howling cy
clone. lam a quiet man and can be pul
upon to a certain extent, but there are
things that flesh and blood can't stand,
and having my step-ladder kidnaped. and
held for a ransom is one of "em."
Mrs. Wiggins went back to her dishes,
and pretty soon Mr. Wiggins came up
stairs laden with an assortment of toote,
large and varied enough to start a small
shop.
"There's only four to fit, anyway," he
said, cheerily; "the hall-room window is
regular size, but the others will have to
be pared off a little. I'll put the easiest
one up first." And tden he went ud to
the hall bedroom, whence presently there
came the sound of a most alarming crash.
"It's only the washbowl," explained
Mr. Wiggins airily, as his frightened wife
appeared. "I got up on one end of it â
â the stand, I mean â and the rickety thine
tipped and spilled me and the bowl off.
It must have been cracked before or it
wouldn't Lave broke so blame easy ! Why
didn't you bring up the screwdriver, and
not come up empty-handed?' 1
"I'll get it," answered Mrs. Wiggins,
dutifully, picking up the pieces of the
bowl in her apron, "and 1 ' â having learned
wisdom lrooi long experience â "if there's
anything else you want I'll bring it
along."
Mr. Wiegins grnnted.
"I can't think of anything much just
now, but some opera tickets, some patty
de foy graw, a new suit of clothes and a
certified- check for $10,000," he replied with
withering sarcasm; "bring them along,
plea&e. And ii ain't my heirs and assigns
that want that screwdriver, it's me! Tem
pus is fugitting right along, and it's most
church time." And Mrs. Wiggins obedi
ently hurried away.
That first shade went up all right, and
Mr. Wigpins, with much self-glorification,
started in on the bay-windows.
"Go and get your dress on, Susan," he
said, "it won't take me fifteen minutes to
finish this job, so you'd better not let tho
grass grow under your feet."
"All right," returned liis wife, smilingly,
and she retired to her chamber, put on her
best gown, tied her bonnet strings and
appeared at the parlor door putting on
her gloves. "It's twenty two â " she said,
" 'most, time for the second bell, and your
clothes are ail laid out."
Mr. Wiggins, lying prone upon his
stomach, with his legs spread out, in the
vain endeavor to keep a curtain flat upon
which lie was trying, witn the aid of a
broomstick, to draw a straight line, looked
up disgustedly.
"I don't care if it's twenty-nine!" he
snorted; "and I don't care if it's time for
the sixth bell! And as for my clothes
being 'laid out,' I don't believe you'd shed
a tear if I was laid out myself! If you had
a glimmer of feeling for the man you
swore to love and honor you'd come and
help him with this cantankerous thing
instead of rigging yourself out like a con
founded peacock and coming here to show
yourself off and gloat over his misery!"
Mrs. Wiggins' tender heart was smit
teD, and she pulled off her gloves so
hastily that she pulled the thumb com
pletely out of one of them. Then, turning
up the front o( her dress she knelt beside
him.
"You told me to go and dress, dear,"
she said deprecatingly, "and I thought
you were almost through. Why don't
you use the yardstick instead of the
broom - handle? It's right behind the
chin>Â«-closet door, and it is a deal better
to draw a line by."
"I don't need any information on that
point," returned Mr. Wiggins with a dig
nity which on account ot his position was
not as crushing as it was intended to be,
I; but when a plain, simple man like me,
who isn't able to keep his own private
clairvoyant and hasn't the time to go and
consult a public one every other minute,
is married to a human magpie who takes
a fiendish delight in hiding everything in
all sorts of mysterious places, he haÂ» to use
any blame thing he can stumble over, and
be humbly thankful. As for me being
'nearly through,' Mrs. Wiggins, you ain't
paying by the hour for this job, and it
ain't any of your matters if I'm at it three
weeks. I ain't a lightning express oe a
gasoline explosion, but if I'm slow I'm
sure, and I don't want to be bossed too
much, either, nor found fault with. If
you think you know where that yardstick
is I wish you'd bring it back to its home
and friends before it sprouts and takes
I root in some foreign clime."
While Mrs. Wiggins was gone out in the
dining-room Mr. Wiggins took the skin
off his bands in three places with the j
screwdriver and burst the button off his
| snirtband, and he was in a correspond
j ingly amiable frame of mind when she
! returned.
"I suppose yon've gone into the busi
i ness of manufacturing those thines since
i you left," he said, with a simulation of
j affectionate interest. "How many have
you got in stock now and what commis
sion would you allow a lively man who
I could make quick sales for you? Yes, I
I burst the button off my shirt," noticing
her glancing at it. "I did it on purpose;
rigged up a block and tackle and hoisted
till it Jet loose. 1 like it that way ; it's
cool and comfortable and different from
other folks. Now you've got your infor
mation I wish you'd take hold and help
a little. You can draw that line as well as
I can if you'll try to overcome your nat
ural modesty enough to think so."
"I'll po and take my dress off first,"
suggested Mrs. Wiggins. 'The sun makes
it pretty warm in here, and besides I'm
afraid it'll pet linty off the carpet. You
don't mind, do you, dear?"
"Mind?" echoed Mr. Wiggins with fine
scorn. "Why should I mind what you
take off? I ain't /. r.thony Comstock, and
if I was, I'm too bv.sy to notice you.
Takeoff all you want to, only hurry up
about it There's something to be done
here to-day besides getting up dress re
hearsalÂ» and primping before a lookinp
glass. When you put me onto a job like
this you've pot to help rce out, and not
spend all your time prancing round in
your best clothes and pretending to be a
lily of the iieldâ which you ain't, not by a
jugful!"
When Mrs. Wiggins came downstairs
again her husband, u*ing twu of ihe
plush chairs for a s-awbuck, was trying
to saw a curtain stick lo the proper length,
but as his saw was dull, rusty and lacked
several teeth, and he knew very little
about the science of sawing anyway, ne

was making very poor headway, and the
apoplectic symptoms which he was be
ginning to exhibit were almost alarming.
"Hard work, isn't it, dear?" Mrs. Wig
gins sympathized. "Now tell me what
to do; I'm all ready."
"You can stand there in your tracks
and ask a lot of idiotic question?,"
snarled her husband. "Hunt up one of
them old census blanks and read 'em oft
that; it'll be easier for you, and ea i eaml
luxury is what you're pining lor always.
Hard? No, it ain't. It's just as easy as
pie. I'd like to do it every Sunday and
evenings, too; it would be soothing after
a long day's work. It's a regular picnic,
only a fellow gets lonesome for the grass
hoppers and old maids. I say, Susan,
when you get good and tired standing
there on one leg staring at me I wish
you'd start around and do something. I
want that knife I left upstairs, and I want
those old curtain-sticKs out in the shed â
I've broke one of these and the old ones
are too big. Then I want a drink of water
and my pipe; then you can mark those
other shades and pare 'em off."
Poor Mrs. Wiggins! She traveled
wearily up and down stairs; she pros
trated herself on the floor to do the mark
ing and stretched on tiptoe to hand her
husband the tools he was using. She
blistered her fingers cutting the curtains
with a pair of shears which were afflicted
with intermittent lockjaw, and she got a
headache irom the glare of the sun,
which poured into the parlor as if its mis
sion were to prepare her and her husband
for a cannibal feast. And Mr. Wiggins
fretted and fumed and fussed and ham
mered his fingers, and broke his suspend
ers, and ycraped his shins getting on and
oft ibe table, and still those curtains were
obdurate.
They would refuse to go up at al.', or
they would go up with startling sudden
ness to the top of the window, or they
would stop at some seif-seiected way-sta
tion from which nothing could move
them. They did everything which they
should not, and nothing which they
should during that long forenoon.
When the neighbors came home from
church Mr. Wiggins was stilt at work,
and their scandalized eyes beheld him
standing on the table, his begrimed and
WAR SONG OF THE CUBAN PATRIOTS
SSPSLHE "HIMNO CUBANOS" is the national anthem of the Cubans; the war song that inspires the patriot with the resolution "to do or die" ; that urges him on to
glorioUÃ victory or to, in his own eyes and those of hi 3 people, a stilt more glorious death. Its stirring notes and words, voiced by many a freeman's throat, have been
J*f* the prelude to the onsweep for freedom that struck terror into the souls of tho hated Spaniards. Like other songs that have been the companion and the inspira
tion of freedom's childhooddays, the origin of this is yet in obscurity. The tune dates back many years, to the time when the spirit of libertyâ newly awakened, and yet
half smothered in the patriotic Cuban breast â first began to voice itself in wordless but meaning melody.
Furtively breathed at first by some venturesome liberty lover, its notes awakened responsive echoes in many a breath which cherished like feelings and linked in
everlasting fraternal bonds hearts that before hardly dared to think aloud the thoughts, suggested by the melody. Soon words were fitted and sung to the music. They
could have no spirit other than that of the melody.
The tune was carried from place to place throughout Eastern Cuba, and though the words often varied the theme never. "To arms! Not for glory, but to break the
chains of tyranny !" was ever the burden, whether sung in the hills of Santiago or the plains of Puerto Principe.
The exact time of Ihe origin of the turte, or who was the author, is not known. A grateful and free posterity may find him out and link his name to the song as a fit
ting monument to his genius. Long before the declaration for freedom at Yara in 1868 by Cespedes and his bold Bayamese compatriots the tune, with the words substantially
as given above, were familiar to every lover of freedom about Bayafno and the neighboring towns. It was taken up by the army and sung throughout the "ten years' war."
Wherever they went they carried it with them. It signalized triumph or solaced defeat. It led the triumphal march into the towns and villages wrested from the oppressors,
and it infused new life into the drooping spirits defeated by the outnumbering foe. Never put in print, but soon all Cuba knew it and suug it. It was then the "Himno
Bayamis" â the "Bayamese Hymn"; now it is the "Himno Cubanos." The song, brought from the cradle-side of Cuban freedom â Bayamoâ by the band of brave men who
first drew for the cause, found an echo in every free Cuban heart, and has been adopted by the Nation.
From Cape Maisi to Cape San Antonio it may be heard, not only timing the martial movements of the patriot army as they fly at the foe but from the herder on the
bill, the plowman on the plain, the belle at the ball and the housewife at the daily drudge. Its fuJl-voiced notes discover every Cuban gathering, and its whistled strains
cheer the lonely way of the solitary traveler, though to be heard by the Spaniard is to be accused as a traitor and doomed to death.

decorously conceal the bald top of his

one shoulder.
"If I were you, Achilles," ventured Mrs.
WigginÂ«, Brently,"l would rest a while, just
till the folks get by. The minister will be
along presently."
Mr. Wiggins, hitherto unconscious of
all save his occupation, suddenly de
scended from his lofty perch with surpris
ing alacrity.
"I resi.n this fool job right here and
now, Mrs. Wiggins," he declared, glaring i
at her vindictively, and giving one of the !
shades a jerk that brought it down,
brackets and all, at his feet. "I am will
ing to slave at legitimate toil for my
family and sacririco myself in many ways,
but when the wife of my bosom sets me
up on a pedestal in the parlor window, to
be sneered at and reviled by the passing
throng, it is time to assert myself. Those
shades are eoing into tue ash-barrel, nnd

too much fatigued by standing round
doing nothing all the morning 1 wish you
would trot it out; if you are I'll go and
beg a crust from some charitable person
and say no more about it."
Mr. vViggins had his lunch, of course,
j and a nap after it, and in the evening he
went to church with his wife ana put a
dollar into the contribution - box. The
next day a man came with a full set of
really handsome shades ana hung them
so neatly and quickly that it seemed like
magic, and the white dove of peace
perched again on the Wiggins ridge-pole.

A Californian`s Novel Invention
/\ j^edding Jean's Paddle-Wkeel for J?o\jgn Water â TKe Princi
ple Gar\ Be Applied ir\ Increasing Speed of
Ocean Vessels
f^apiNE of the great problems of the
l|4ir & K e is to increase the speed of
I^JFft ocean steamships, and any idea or
invention that points toward this end is
always worthy of consideration. I
The maximum of efficiency between the
steam engine and the propeller-wheel was
practically reached several years ago.
W. WRIGHTS Invention for a Rough-Water Paddle-Wheel Steamer.
Improvements are made in propeiler
wbeels lrom time to time, but there is no
great gain in that direction. Awheel that
will develop half a knot more speed per
hour over the best wheels now used and
with the same horsepower will yield its
inventor a fortune.
At present the best way and, one might
say the only way, to increase the speed
of a steamer is to increase the horsepower
of the engine and the number of propeller
wheels. To develop an increase of power
engines of several cylinder* are construct
ed so that the steam expands three or four
times before passing into the condensers.
As it is a propeller-wheel will develop
only a small percentage of the power of
the engine, the rest being wastftd in lost
motion through the inevitable "slipping"
of the wheel in the water.
In view of such facts it would seem as
if a return to first principles â the paddle
wheel â would be the only solution of the
problem, for snips are now constructed
that carry all the engine-power it is pos
sible to crowd into them. The paddle
/lIANO Bayaaies,
wheel will give out nearly all the power
put into it, but has always had several
drawbacks when it came to using It in
rough water or at a high speed. In rough
water, when the ship roiled the wheels
frequently came out of water and the en
gines "ran away," often causing break
downs. In running ct a high speed the
force of the biades striking the surface of
the water caused an awful jarring all
through the ship, and has been known to
start plates In iron vessels. As a conse
quence, the paddle-wheel has been prac
tically abandoned for ocean vessels, al
though the steamers that run from New
York to Boston are built this way. They
are classed among the fastest vessels in
the world, and are said to ba very
economical, so that passengers are carried
at astonishingly low rates. But most of
their run is through Long Island Sound,
and they do not get very much rough
water.
It was a consideration of these fact
that led W. Wright, at present engaged
in mining about eighteen miles Jiom Red
ding, to make some investigations with a
submerged paddle-wheel. He has been
working on it for ayear or more, and at
present has a working model that de
velops great speed and seems to be free
from the objections of the ordinary
method of paddle propulsion.
Mr. Wright was in the City a few days
ago and kindly made drawings and gave
a description of his vessel.
"When I began to study the matter,"
said Mr. Wright, "I first figured on sub
merging a paddle-wheel without any
covering. What was the result? When it
revolved the upper blades pushed bacfc
equally as the bottom blades pushed for
ward. Consequently there was no force
developed either one way or the other, it
was a balance.
"Then it struck me that if one-half of
the wheel was covered the projecting
blades on being revolved would exert a
force in a certain direction sufficient to
move the covering through the water. I
tried this, but met several difficulties.
But I think I have overcome them all, as
my model will show.
"My first work, " Mr. Wright continued,
"was to make a small vessel of tin and fit
it with a propeller-wheel operated by a
spring motor. I was. careful in building
the wheels on the most approved lines
and made several until I felt sure that I
had obtained all the speed the spring
motor would develop this way.
"I then fitted the same tin ves3el with
the submerged paddle-wheels and operated
them by the same spring motor. 1 had
four paddles and the connections were
crude, but on the first trial it developed
twice the speed of the propeller. And as
far as I can see there is no reason why the
same result should not be obtained on a
large vessel. There is no more jar to the
model than wita the propeller-wheel and
I found it almost impossible, by stirring
the water in the tank, to get any of the
paddle out of water. To develop speed ia
a vessel of certain sizeut is only necessary
to displace a certain amount of water in a
certain time. It makes no difference how
it is done.
"One of the points of my invention is
the constvuction of the paddle-wheel.
When at rest the covering or paddle-box
naturally fills with water, and to start the
wheel would naturally cause a vacuum to
form and consequently great pressure on
the outsido of ttia box. I have overco.ue
this by having a pipe lead to a point above
the water line. Another idea of mine to
have the box free from water, so there will
be no waste of power, is to make the
paddles slightly curved and placed at a
tangent to the arc of the wheel. This
will cause the centrifugal force to throw
the water from the center. When Ihe
blade leaves the box and strikes fresh,
solid water in front it is submerged to the
hub, but by the time it is ready to enter
the box again it is almost free of water.
"in a large vessel the paddle- wheel 3
could be cast of a single piece of bronze
and the sponsons made the same way.
My idea is to have them like the half of
one side of a cantesn, fastened to the ves
sel's side, so as to cause little resistance.
The shape of the vessel could be the same
as at present, but of course there woula
have to be a little difference in the whart
where she landed, in order to protect her
wheels-
"Of course I only look upon my inven
tion as an experiment and have not con
sidered the style of engines to be usea or
the means of coupling them if such is de
sirable. But Ido think that I have â  prio
ciple that can be practically applied to
ward increasing the speed of ocean steam
ers. I am thinfcing of constructing a
working model about twenty feec long,
and should that trove successful I have
no fear about getting my invention
adopted generally."

" Whist- Jeachers " (?) Versus
Whist-Teachers.
Some six weeks ago we received a call from a
lady desiring some information in regard to
whist. She stated she "was going to teach
whist," and wanted to know "what she ought
to charge for lessons" and what book she
ought to buy to beÂ«ome '-proficient" in the
game herself. She stated she had played whist
for a number of years and liked the game ex
coedingiy, but never read a book on the sub
ject in her Hie and didn't know until a few
days ago "that books were published on whist
alone," but she "had to do something," and
"teaching whist would be very nice," as she i
liked it so much. She had heard ol "Mr. Cay- !
eudlsh," but thought he was killed it, a park ;
somewhere several years ago. As tins little !
lady came to us for advice we asked her this
question: "Can you speak the Chinese lan
guage ?" She answered, "No." We told her
she might as well undertake to teach that !
language as to teach whist without a thorough I
knowledge of it herself, and that it could only
be obtained or acquired by close application,
patient and hard study for ai least two or
three years. This lady is now "teaching
whist." Unfortunately for the game on this
coast and elsewhere, we have too many such
"teachers." With the little knowledge that j
we possess we would not presume to consider
ourselves competent to teach more than the
ABCof the game.
"Whist-teachera" hare been springing up
like mushrooms all over the country. They
sometimes get a smattering of the leads,
"second nand low, third hand high," business, j
pick up a few fads, and away they go full
fledged "whist-teachers"â a few of them know
that Mr. Trist, General Drayson or "Caven
dish" ever existed. This class of so-called j
wuist-'eachers shonld not be allowed to prey
upon the innocent whiht public. The Ameri
can Whist League should, through its channels
of authority, its directorate or committee with j
sub-committees appointed for that purpose,
issue a letter to those who wish to teach and
are found qualified, free of expense. By so
doing it will improv.- the standard of the
game and separate the chaff from (he wheat.
Wt don't niewn by this to allow the A. W. L. to
be used as a "cat-paw" or channel for the sale
of whist jimcracks or for the personal in
terests of any one, but merely to put achefk I
on what will grow to be an abuse if it has not
Already done so. The time is about due when
the A. W. L. khould draw a line between "pro- j
fessionals," and "amateurs," or those that are i
in whist for money from those who are in it
for love.

Score: North and touth 1, East and West

Trick 3â North plays a false card to no pur
pose and without benefit.
Trick sâ East leads another round of trumps
for the purpose of ascertaining from partner's
discard which of his two suits is the stronger.
North discards from West's declared strong
snit.
Trick 7â Kast here treats his spade suit as a
short one, his object being to leave West with
winning spade, if he has one, so that West may
make any winning hearts he may hold. If
North holds up bis ace of spades he wouldgain
a trick.
Trick Bâ West's discard of a heart shows he
must hold a winning spade or else hearts only.
Therefore, at
Trick 9 East continues the snit arfl East ana
West make all the remaining tricks.

number in suit on partner's lead. It is evident
that winning with queen and returning ace
gives aDsolutely no information as to the num
ber in .suit, and that, even if a third round be
taken out, the original leader frequently can
not tell whether his partner has another
trump or not. In order to oveicome this d fa
culty it has been suggested that with four
trumps the third hand on partner's lead (from
ttrengih, of course) play the ace and return
the queen. Statistics and experience have
convinced the writer that this is a winning
p'.ay." â¢ â¦ *
We would hite to ask Mr. Work this ques
tion: If the above play la sound why. we
should not be abie to reverse it as in other
trump-showing plays? For instance, same
holding (nee, queon, two small) on partner's
rail for trumps, to lead queen, then ace, to
show four exactly. It strikfs us thnt one must
be just ns sound as thy other. The risk of los
ing the queen may be a little greater than the
other, but how much" ?
ShoWing Number on partner's
Original Lead or the Plain
Suit Echo.
It is a remarkable fact, but nevertheless
true, that the great majority of whist-players
do not draw any line between unblocking in n
Â«uit and showing number. Supposing you hold
5. 4, fl and 2 of a suit and your partner (the
original leader) onens with ace, what card do
yon play? Do you commence to unblock or
show number? It is impossible to block a suit
with such b< holding, consequently you cannot
unblock, but you can show number.
Most authorities that have written books on
the game say when your partner leads Jrom a
fonr-card suit, and you hold exactly four
cards, play tha lowest, and don't attempt to
unblock. We don't think this covers the case
as it should and, certainly from our way of
thinking, not the best whist. We believe when
the original leader opens with any high card
which proclaims four or more in suit, and the
leader's partner having four, he should play
the third best on first round, If the lead is fol
lowed by another high card, or if the third
hand does not attempt to take the trick he
should play second Lest By this means you
show number; at the same time you can un
block if the situation warrants it, but the es
sence of the play is the important information
you give partner. Again, these same whiÂ«
writers seem to be a unit in advising players
holding rive cards in the suit that his partner
opens originally with a high card to play the
lowest. We take exceptions to this also. We
tions from grand and comic opera made up a
very entertaining programme. The singers
acquitted themselves very creditably for ama
teurs. The attendance was large for a wet
night and each Ginger received a goodly share
|oi applause. .Many flora i tributes were pre
' sented. Professor 7 Greveu accompanied the
! singers.

think the third best should be played in al 1
cases; when the suit is opened from strength
(four or five card suit) the principal object is
to give valuable information to your partner,
and it should be given before it Is too late.
Here is an example:
The leader opens with king followed by ace,
proclaiming a four-card suit. Second hand
plays seven, then eight. Tnird hand plays
two, then threeâ holding; queen, ten, nine,
t'iree, two. Fourth hand phtys five, then six.
What information has third hand given his
DHrtner? Now play our way. Third hand on
kine plays nine, on ace he plays the ten (cards
in other hands dropping same as before). Is
there any donnt atout the balance of the uuit

Mining in California
f"fÂ«VHE recent announcement of W. H.
j\.A Mills, the Central Pacific land agent,
\\. tliat trie railroad company will re
from tale for the encouragement of
m j n ing the mineral lands within its grant
now patented to it or for whicn it may re
ceive patents, and that it will afford free
opportunity to miners to discover and de
velop minerals on such lands, will attract
ur.ien interest among mining men. The
railroad company announces that it will
allow prospecting for minerals on its pat
ented lands under contracts the terms of
which are not specified, but which will
protect the prospector in any discovery he
may make. It is also proclaimed that the
company will formally relinquish title to
any mine now actually operated on land be
longing to the railroad and wi'l relinquish
claim to any such mine on unpatented
railroad land. The manner and spirit
with which the railroad company will
carry out these promises and the further
general one that it will be its general pol
icy to encourage the mining industry re
main to be seen, as do the problems of the
intention of the company in relation to
the mineral lands bill pending in Con
gress and the effect oi the announcement
on the fate of the bill. The idea of a
railroad company offering to contract
with prospectors for the latter's benefit is
certainly a novel one. The campaign in
bebalf of the mineral lands bill will, of
course, be maintained as vigorously as
ever by the Miners' Association.
.c week has not brought any impor
/ developments in the pending legisia
at Sacramento in ihe interest of the
ers, but it has also brought no signs of
opposition which change the confident
prospect that the important bills proposed
will be passed with little amendment.
The State Mining Bureau seems certain
to receive the liberal appropriation which
its service to the mining industry aud the
present especial need of it warrant.
Tirey L. Ford, chairman of one of the
legislative committees of the Miners'
Association, will be at Sacramento this
week, and while there, in the general in
terest of mining legislation, wil. 1 propose
an amendment to the bill reappropriating
$250,000 lor restraining dams, providisg
that the proposed Commissioner be sub
ject to the Slate Board of Examiners in
expending the money. A Southern Cali
fornia miners' convention will be held in
a few days through the efforts of the
Riverside County miners, and recom
mendations concerning State raining
legislation will be formulated and sent to
fcacramento.
Tue Pacific Coast Steamship Company,
which watches indications closely, is not
figuring on the phenomenal rush to Alaska
this spring which is being frequently pre
dicted irorn the Puget Sound region. One or
the latest forecasts was that from 15,000 to
20,000 would measure the rush. Last year
the camber was about 2000. At the gen
eral offices of the steamship company it
is aaid that the anticipations are for con-
siderable but not a notabie increase of
business. The company, however, will
tiiis year run a steamer from the sound to
Juneau and Sitka every live days instead
of twice a month as last year.
Inquiry Ã¼bout Alaska has not become
noticeable in San Francisco, bat it is much
livelier at Seattle and Tacoma, and there
Â«iue merchants are much interested in j
iting those intending to go. The j
eau merchants are vigorously carry
ing on a campaign to induce prospectors
to wait until they get to Juneau to buy
their outfits and supplies and maintain a
bureau at Seattle for that purpose.
The Alaska Commercial Company will
probably further improve its Yukon River
It will have five steamers on that
stream this year instead of four as last
year, and irregular trips will be made
from St. Michaels to Forty-mile Camp and
other points. One steamer wiil occa
sionally reach Fort Selkirk, 2300 miles
from the mouth of the gr-at river. This
year, as will each .-uccee iing year, will see
some increase in opportunities and con
veniences for travel and sub3ktence and
some amelioration of ihe privations which
prospectors and miners must undergo, but
there will be plenty of hardship to face
acain this year, especially for men with a
Ehort supply of money.
There is unquestionably a great future
for gold mining in Alaska, however, and
it will be gradually ar.d steadily developed
at the cost of money, failures and lives
The presence of god placers along the
Yukon is of course certain evidence that
deposits of jroid-bearing quartz are some
where distributed over a vast region.
According ;o reports from Washington
the United States Geological Survey has
published a report of the expedition sent
10 the Alaskan goldlields last summer.
The placer gold was traced to quartz veins
nlonp the headwaters of tributaries of the
"Yukon, and a gold belt 300 miles long wns
outlin d. Tue Geoloxical Surrey will
doubtless soon make a more adequate re
connoissance of the region and into it pros
pectors will be going before very Jon;:.

TO HOLD A Y. M. I. DAY.
Local Councils Will Patriotically
Celebrate It on Febru
ary 22.
There Wil! Be an Entertainment in
the Afternoon ani a Grand Ball
in the Evening.
The members of the thirteen councils of
the Young Men's Institute of this City
have for some time past been busy mak
ing preparations for the proper observ
ance of the anniversary of the birth of
George Washington, which has been se
lected as Y. M. I. day.
The members of this order are inspired
by patriotism, the teaching of which is
one of the principles of the organization.
Atone of the sessions of the Grand
Council it was suggested that one day in
the year be selected as the one to be ob
served by the members, and it was far
ther suggested that the one to be se
lected should be one identified with Amer
ican history. After the matter had been
thoroughly canvassed it was decided to
can history. After the matter nad D<;en
'.oroughly canvassed it was decided to
elect the 22d of February.
' The initial steps for ti.e coming celeora
tion were taken a few weeks ago, and
sines then the various committees Re
jected have been actively at wort, to the
end that this year's arrangements shall
surpass those of the previous year.
The following-named have been selected
as the general, committee: E. li. Thomas
of those interesting articles thereon by an
engineer just published by the Mining and
Scientific Press without causing dispute or
controversy. Tie articles were an effort
to dispassionately analyze the damage
done by detritus in the Sacramento Val
ley and the responsibility therefor. John
D. McGiJlivray, editor of that paper,
briefly sums up the showing made as fol
lows:-
Firstâ Of the debris sent down into the Sac
ramento drainage system while hydraulic
mining was carred on unrestrictedly not over
one-fiith could have come from the mines.
Second â Owing to the increased population
in the foothills and mountains since that time,
and consequently greater erosion, the amount
of debris now coming down is about as great
as it was while the mines were in operation,
and consequently the evils then complained of
are as great as ever.
Thirdâ That had hydraulic mining not been
discontinued some $75,000,000 would nave
been produced from the mines, and the loss in
value oi capital and income to the State has
amounted to over $200,000,000.
Fourthâ The direct damage caused by the
debris making lands valueless, ioss oi product
and loss to sympathetic industries has not
amounted to over $50,000,000, and of this cer
tainly not over one-flith could be charged to
the hydraulic miners.
Sixthâ The maximum damage possible If all
lands that lie low enough to ba covered with
debris should be destroyed would not exceed
$40,000,000.
During 1896 the Selby Smelting Works
handled gold ores, Ihe total value of which
exceeded by $2,0007000uie value of the gold
ores handled in 1895. Secretary Under
| wood expects another marked increase
i during 1897. This great concern is the
I only smelter in California doing custom
work, but the near future promises to see
the establishment ot other big smelters in
this State, as well as in Oregon, Washing
ton and British Columbia. There ismucn
talk going on about smelters being erected
â  at various points, and a number of towns
! are wanting one. Coiton and Los Angeles,
1 Grants Pass. Oregon, Vancouver and Ross
land, B. C, are among them.
The Mountain copper mines in Bhasts
! County ara giving an impetus to the min
ing of low-grade ores in that region by
buying them for use as a flux for their
copper ores in their smelter.
It is expected that the Bellwether, Argo
naut and Anila mines in Amador County
will each receive forty-stamp mills during
the year.
Rich ore has been found in the Tyron,
near Angels, in Calaveras County.
The old Skinner mine in El Dorado
County is to be renamed the Empress
Josephine by the recent purchasers, who
are driving a tunnel into the hill in the
development of its deeper r'ches.
R. D. Harper of San Francisco has

mines in Maripoaa County, which have
lain iale for years.
Fres-no and Eastern people who have
bought several mines in the Snerlocks
country, Mariposa County, intend to erect
an eiectric power plant on Sherlocks Creek
to operate the mines.
Two prospectors recently found a small
deposit of gravel on Squaw Creek, Snasta
County, which yielded them $800. Many
men are at work on old gravel or at crevi
cinp.

abont $6000 a month. John Lang, the
prospector who i'riginal!y discovered the
Lost Horse, has just made a rich find three
miles lrom the Lost Horse.
The Golden Cross mine in Southern
California, near Yuma, ia yielding $1000 a

The Colton cement works have resumed
operations, and expect to keep going this
time.
The Gold Mountain mine, San Bernar

A debris agitation teems to be brewing
in the Lower Fraser, in British Columbia,
as the mining development proceeds.
According to the Oroviile Mercury,
Butte County produced $250,000 more in
gold in 1596 than in 1835.
Carbonate liiil, L'-adville, which has
produced ore worth $75,0 X),000 and given
employment to a thou and people, has
been stilled for some years as a certain
result of the strike. Tho hoisting out of
the big pumps in some of the largest
properties and the consequent flooding
has dismayed the city and the striking
miners. The activity of the Leadville
district, whenever it is resumed in the
future, will be in the line of development in
other parts of the district and it will be
years befo.e Leadville recovers from the
blow of the s;i!l unsettled strike.
Keen competition has demoralized the

Notes From Randsfeurg.
Kandsbukg, Jan. 36, 1897.
There is an immense amount of freighting to
this point, both by way of Kramer and Mo
jave, and the long desert roads are literally
spotted with teams of all descriptions. There
are now six daily stages bringing loads of pas
sengers, and a safe estimate of the arrivals
wouli be at least forty people each day by
stage and probably half as many more by
private conveyance. Hotels and lodging
houses are being built on all sides and are
taxed to their utmost to accommodate the
travel. There are now over 200 wooden bui.d
ings and nearly 300 tents in the town proper.
The Olympus, Kiuyon, Wedge and Eutte mines
| are working a full force of men and turning
out large quantities of high-grade ore. A rich
strike was made in the Butte mine the other
I day and ore that will run $20 to the sack is
i now being sent to the mill.
Real estate has taken quite a spurt during
â  the past week and many transfers are being
I made at rates fully 100 per c--nt in advance of
| prices ruling a week ago. This movement Is
due largely to the fact of the organization of a
strong company backod by Los Angeles capi
tal that has taken hold of the Val Verde
group of mines, formerly owned by C. A.
Burcham. This company proposes to at once
commence work on a three-compartment shaft
and sink to the depth of 1000 feet. There are
two well-defined veins running parallel to
each other on this property and about 300 feet
apart, showing about six feet of $20 ore, Rnd
it is aimed to cut the upper one at about 300
j feet and the lower one at 600 leet depth. A
part of the plan of operation is to pipe water
from a point ten miles distant and in ample
quantity to not omy supply their own needs
| but for all purposes of milling and domestic
! uses at a rate not to exceed one-fiith of the
present cost. This will bring milling down to
about $5 p->r ton and enable the starting up ot
many low-grade properties, in which this dis
trict abounds.
There are a great many practical mine
operators here at the present time who are
ciosciy investigating the district, and many
purchases oi mining claims are being quietly
mad.' by men of means ana experience, indi
cating that the camp is on the eve of a genu
ine boom. Representatives are here from
every large mining syndicate on tho Pacific
Slope. Marcus Daly of Montana has one or
more men here at all times, and the o'.d-time
methods that have made him famous In every
California mining camp until begets a foot
hold are being observed here in his crying
down every enterprise that lends to real de
velopment of the camp; at the same time r>e
is negotiating for several promising pieces of
property here. Messrs. Brown and Shinn,
large owners in t;;e Litt.e Johnny mine, the
famous gold- producer of Leadviile, Colo.,
have made severa ! purchases and are pushinc
development work on all ttieir claims.
A rich strike has been made in the Eureka
mine, lying immediately south of the O.ym
pus, and a body of ore measuring over four
;eot in thickness and running fully $40 per
ton was cut by a cross tunnel at a depth of
200 feet from the cropping on the surlace.
This property is owned b; R. F. Dickenson of
Frcsuo, who came here a short time ago, hav
ing had no former experience in mining.
The new five-stamp mill at Cuddeback lake,
near the famous St. Elmo mine, was started
up this week. This makes thirty-five camps
now dropping in the district and one five-foot

If the request was granted every pre
caution would retaken to prevent cruelty.
No action was taken, which means that
the society will not in nny way give its
sanction to live-pigeon shooting.

--1\l" There's a tempest in the punch
â ii^L^ bowl; and the great and small
craft of Gotham's society are eagerly tack
ing for fair-weather ports, where tattered
sails and damaged hulks may be mended
without inconvenience to the owners.
Lite a typhoon on the Chinese seas, a
reverend doctor â one William S. Rains
fordâhas swept all before him during the
paÂ«t week. Boldly and bravely he has
declared that the luvish and gaudy osten
tation of the mighty rich in New York is
driving the thousands of hall-starved poor
to despair and desperation.
From his pulpit in St. George's Protes
tant Episcopal Church in Stuyvosant
square be hns hurled burning sentences
of .-corn and bitter reprimand at ihe be
diamonded rich, and with swimming eyes
and trembling voice, half choked with
Christian emotion, he has told the
hoarders of riches the oft-repeated tale of
poverty and starvation, strengthening the
force of it by throwing the high lights of
local color on the sufferings of the half
starved, half-clad poor of Greater New
York.
The whole rumpus has been brought
about by a bunch of busy bodies, and
though i)r. Rainsford refrained from using
names every one felt ;onvinced that he
was slapping the Bradley- Martins squarely
across the front.
On the 10th of February one of the
grandest ana most costly balls of the sea
son will be given at the Waldorf by Mr.
and Mrs. Bradley-Martin. Invitations
have been sent out bidding about 400
guests to attend their grand bal masque.
'Tis said their cotillon given at Delmon
ico's several years ago cost over $50,000.
Their bal masque at the Waldorf will
amount to something like $100,000.
Queryâlsn't it a good thing for the com
munity at large to have ihe wealthy pleas
ure-seekers loosen their private sacks and
empty some of their shekels into the
palms of the generous trades people.
"The ayes have it!"
Jerome Cox Ball and his lovely bride ar
rived in town on Monday and registered
at the Park Avenue Hotel on Fourth

where they will reside for the winter.
Last Tuesday found District Attorney
Carl E. Lindsay of Santa Cruz way down
on Nassau street looking wise and serious.
"I'm not supposed to be in New York just
now," said he with a smile, "but I hap
pened to arrive a day or two ahead of
time. I will remain but a couple of days
here. 1 can't say lam bent on any par
ticular business; there were really Â»everal
reaaons lor my flying trip to this cold and
ice-bound city," and with a hearty Califor
nia handshake, he hurried along and was
lost in the changing throng.

One of the most popular members of the

rendezvous for -restless or idle Bohemians,
though ne makes a few caosen friends
welcome. He is too busy to spare the
daylight hours away from his paints ami
canvas, because his time is constantly oc
cupied in creating new light and shade
effect.". Mr. Rix spends four or five
months every year at his little bungalow
studio among the Singac Hills in New
Jersey.
There he paints exclusively out of
doors, catchine the sunlight as it fails
across an. open in the woods, or quickly
reproducing the tender atmosphere which
beautifies even the dullest landscape.
Among his recent works arc several that
will appeal to the lovers of nature's peace
ami repose.
One is "The Edge of the Forest After a
Rain." The trees look newly washed and
t c ground, grasses and rocks look glisten
ing and wet as though a heavy rain bad
just ceased. The gray skies are breaking
and showing patches of blue and white
between.
Another is a moonlight scene, and Mr.
Rix has cunningly caught the wonderful
iridescent effect on the water that one
often sees but cannot describe.
Hanging i.. a heavy frame of gilt is an
immense picture of the Santa Cruz
Mountains, with great, heavy banks of
white fosr creeping down over their sum
mits. It is dubbed "Incoming Fop;"
"Easterners don't like Western scenery,
as a rule," says Mr. Rix, "first, because
few of them have ever seen such high
mountains and ihe majority won't believe
there are such rugged h ights. That is
the reason most of my compositions are
of the lowlands and placid lakes. Atmo
sphere, nature's joyous colorings and the
red glow of a crimson sunset are worth a
lifetime of study if one can just succeed
dow and then in reproducing them on
canvas," says Mr. Rix, in a cheerful and
confident tone. He has succeeded. "No,
I have never married, and" (sighing) "I'm
too much of a bachelor now to ever try
marriage."
There may be some one who will con
vince him to the contrary.

Many complimenti and congratulations
have been paid Clara Foltz during the past

bill on public defenders, which was intro

There is no doubt that Pauline Ag
nes Ryder will mate a name and fame
for herseif, which will carry her up among
the gifted ones in the world of music.
Born at Los Angeles .in 1879 she grew to
be a girl o! eleven years Defore her mother,
Mrs. I. C. Ryder, discovered her daughter
had natural gifts for music. The violin \
was the young girl's chosen instrum nt.
After several years of industrious study in i
Los Angeles, s.'ie and her mother came on j
to New York. Since her arrival she has !
been studying under the best masters.
Recently she has played at a number of j
musicales and recitals most successfully.
Her rendering of MendeUsohn'3 famous
"Capriccioso" is marvelous in execution,
and she has been warmly received and
highly complimented by such great musi- !
cians as Paderew^ki and Camilla Urso, i
the great violinist. Miss R/der is quite |
tall, lithe and graceful and forms a pretty
picture when in the poetic position a
violinist nia'/ assume when playing. She j
is a true Californian in her ambition to be j
the first on top, and f imo in all its refine- j
ment will undoubtedly be ners. She i? so i
young and unassuming that until one has !
heard her play one can scarcaly realize
the wondrous gifts which nature has 1
â bowered on her. She is at present study- j
ing with Mme. Wrencowski, who is here I
in New York for the purpose o: preparing
pupils for the great maestro, Lechitezky
of Vienna. Miss Ryder will go abroad
next. fall.
This week the women's clubs are to meet
r.t Carnegie Lyceum ani discuss toe

the ladies do not like the form of said

expressed in what the women are likely to
say.

SOCIALISTS ACTIVE.
Will Have to Secnre More Commodious
Quarters.
Tbe Socialists are nothing if not aggres
sive. They are determined that the
world shall be made better by their efforts
and if they fail many times their defeat
gives them renewed courage and iucreased
strength to fight the battles over again.
At the last election tbe Socialist Labor
party had a ticket in the field, not that
they ever believed that the general public
had accepted the Socialists' Heas of eco
nomics and would elect their candidates,
but to demonstrate that there is a large
element in the community that is not
satisfied with <he present order of things.
They were defeated, Dut not crushed,
for now these earnest workers are prepar
ing for another campaign under the red
flag of tbe brotherhood of man. Next
March there will be a municipal election
in Oakland and preparations are being
made for another battle in the City of
Oaks across the bay.
The party has a soodly following in
that city ana it proposes to put before the
people the names of Socialist candidates
for office. In this movement they will be
vigorously supported by the Socialists of
San Francisco. Able speakers will be
sent from this sMe to assist in stumping
Oakland and in their campaigning thtj
Sodalisis always do telling work in e.lu-
I eating the people in matters of political

wherever they have planted their banner.
On Monday Messrs. Kin^sley and Ford,
j both convincing speakers, went to Oak
land in the interests 01 the cause and to
open the Oakland campaign.
In this City the socialists of the Ameri
can branch will resume their street rneet
| ings. In the past they have had trouble
with the authorities and with private in
j dividuals in holding these street lectures,
I but they hope that these annoyances and
I interference with free speech will be
j avoiaed in the future. Many converts to
I sociali>m have been made at these open
j air gatherings of people who stopped
through curiosity to listen, but who wero
not previously sufficiently interested to
aitend the regular meetings.

Demolishing the resorts of the high

According to reports from Sacramento
the examination of witnesses in the pay

"roars of laughter." Is it then a comedy
performance?
With a trained statesman for Secretary

Up to date, bills have been introduced \

There are rumors on the street that the
exposure made by the Southern Pacific

to be followed by similar exposures from
other corporations.
The Courier-Journal insists "the Indi

It is noted in New York that Sherry con
tinues to receive the cream of the social

When McKinley nets through with the
hard work of making up his Cabinet he

A Washington clergyman who was can

The newly elected Senator Mason of
Illinois, in an address to the State Legis

believe we should go farther in the tight

ail struggles between a monarch? and a
republic, between liberty and slavery, we
are for liberty." Tliere is certainly a
great deal of jingoism in that, but not
enough to hurt.
CINCH BILLS AND BLACKMAIL.
The time has come in California when decent people should unite for the purpose
of putting an end to cinch bills and blackmail. These foul offenses of legislation and
journalism have been tolerated too long. They have crown from bad to worse until
in alliance they now constitute a menace to invested capital and threaten the welfare
of the State. The time is propitious for attacking them. Both have shown them
selves boldly and if public sentiment can be aroused to combat them now there is a
j reasonable prospect of destroying them altogether.
The extent to whicl legislation and blackmail journalism has been prac
ticed in California can only be guessed at. Even those who think they Know most of
the way affairs have been conducted at Sacramento, and the way in which the San
Francisco Examiner has continued to live despite the drain on the Hearst estate, have
but little conception of the manifold iniquities which have been practiced by corrupt
legislators and vicious journalists. The full degree of their rapacity will never be
made known, but enough has been exposed to well assure the people that such prac
tices have been carried on boldly, defiantly an . impudently.
It is known that the Examiner for a long time drew a subsidy from the Southern
Pacific Company of $1000 a month. That much was made clear by the publication of
the contract under which it drew the subsidy, "and it is hardly necessary for the
Examiner to reiterate the statement and add that it is absolutely true." It is quite
certain, moreover, that this was not the only subsidy the Examiner was drawing from
great corporations. Blackmailers do not confine their extortions to a single victim.
It is likely, if the truth were known, that every corporation of wealth in the City has
been at one time or another compelled to pay tribute to the blackmailers of that
infamous journal in order to save themselves from its lies, slanders and vilifications.
In times past the Examiner conducted its blackmailing schemes with a certain
degree of secrecy. The exposure made by the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
stripped away the mask, however, and it now seeks to seize its prey with impudence,
since hypocrisy is no longer possible. The villainy of its attacks upon the water and
the gas companies is hardly concealed by the pretense of being made in the
interest of the public.
The managers of the paper are, in fact, in desperate straits. The inherited for
tune of Willie Hearst is well nigh expended. Neither the Examiner nor the New
York Journal las ever been on a paying basis. If Mr. Hearst is to continue the
publication of these sheets hs must get money from somewhere. He has never
earned a dollar in his life by legitimate methods, and does not know how to earn it
in t at way. In his despair he has turned his blackmailing highbinders loose to
extort money from whatever corporation they can.
Every man who has any intelligent conception of newspaper business knows that
the Examiner and the Journal have been losing fakes from the start. In New York
Willie Hearst is regarded as "anybody's soft thing." Any kind of a faker or schemer
can work him for a big salary or for "lots of stuff" for a freak. His papers have
ceased to pay any attention to news and are now seeking to gain notoriety by every
kird of trick and scheme which cunning can suggest and vice adopt.
Take the Examiner, for example. Its coupon schemes, lottery fakes, and all its
of her tricKs for obtaining subscribers have cost it more than the new subscriptions
have paid. Its efforts to get advertising by offering a "yard of puppies" for every
advertisement have been equally wasteful. It has attempted to boom its circulation
by offering a large number of copies to every advertiber of importance. In that way
it has run up a fraudulent subscription list by a fake advertising list In neither case,
however, has it made money.
Willie Hearst has been compelled to go every week deeper and deeper into the
estate left by his father. The sums be has thus squandered on fakes, freaks and
frauds amount to millions of doilars, and he is now near the end of his purse. He
has but one resource Jett. His highbinders have been turned loose on San Francisco
and their cry is for boodle and blackmail.
The subsidy once extorted from ihe Southern Pacific Company can be extorted no
loncer. There is reason to believe that subsidies hitherto drawn from other corpora
tions have also been cut off. Rumors go about the town that the exposure made by
Mr. Huntington will soon be followed by exposures of other iniquities. Is it any
wonder that tfie highbinders and blackmailers of the Examiner are desperate? They
have exhausted the fortune left by Senator Hearst. Tney have drawn from his
wasteful ton every dollar that ho can put up. They have drained every interest he
owned in the Anaconda mine. Now they are endeavoring to make an Anaconda of
blackmail.
Men of decency, men of capital invested In legitimate inJustry, men who have
r gard for justice, honesty and fair dealing, should unite in opposing tue schemes of
this depraved and convicted journal. It should no longer be allowed to co-operate
with cinch-bill legislators and Supervisors to extort money which men of business
have earned by honest industry.
HELP FOR INDIA.
The mass-meeting held at the Chamber
of Commerce hall on Tnursday to devise
means for giving assistanc? to the famine
and plague stricken psople of India re
sulted in the appointment of a well
chosen committee to undertake the work.
This committee should receive cordial
assistance from the pc ople generally and
be able speedily to make a report which
will amply manifest that the sympathy of
California for the starving people of that
unfortunate country is not confined to
words merely.
India is a land where the population is
so large that it presses at all points upon
the extreme limits of possible subsist
ence. When a crop fails it means starva
tion to many people of the district unless
outside help is provided. In this case the
d istrict over which the famine prevails is
so large a"nd the Inhabitants so numerous
that the charity of the whole world is re
quired to afford adequate relief to the suf
ferers.
Following the famine has come the
plague. The half-starved people are dy
ing by thousands of disease. Even when
we make the fullest allowances for cx
i agg"rations in the report.? from the
: stricken districts enough will rumain to
j make it certain that India alone is not
| capable of grappling with the evil which
, has befallen her. Help mu3t be sent from
abroad. It should bo sent from every
; land that has Deen blessed by providence.
California is one of those lands. She
should cive help and eive if. promptly.
CECIL RHODES AT BAY.
Unless all signs, like dreams, go by
contraries the comins; investigation by the
British Government into the r-roaeedings
of Cecil Rhodes is going to result in a tine
right or a big backdown. Air. Khode3 has
defiantly challenged the "unctuous recti
tude" of his opponents and they i:ave re
torted with equal vigor. Tne issue be
tween them is now fairly made up and
there is no chance for evasion on either
side.
Interest in the struggle will be almost
a> wide as the civilized world. It is no
ignoble offender who is thus brought to
the bar of British judgment nor are tbe
charges against him of a commonplace or
unimportant nature. Never since the trial
of Warren Hastings has the impeachment
of a single man meant so much to the
British empire as is meant by the threat
ened impeachment of Rhodes.
The present offender, litenis predeces
sor, is a maker of empires. If hi 3 accom
plishments have not been so great or so
splendid as those of Ha* tings it is only be
cause South Africa as yet is not so rich, so
famous or so renowned as India. It is,
nevertheless, a mighty country, which
Cecil Rhodes has dominated and added to
the British crown. Nor does it detract
from his dignity that in expanding the
possessions at Cape Colony he has acted
with such self-reliant independence as to
raise the suspicion that he aims not to
widen the dominions of his sovereign, but
to make in fc-outh Africa another United
States and establish it as a free, separate
and independent republic.
At present the dramatic interest in the
stiuggle is centered in the personality of
I Rhodes. His opponents are as yet an un
known and confused multitude. It will
not be until some champion come 3 forth
to lead them that the public will turn its
attention at all from the single splendid
figure that now stands apparently alone
against a host of foes. It may not be long,
â  however, before the champion of the other
I side appears, and it would not surprise
i the world to find him no less a man than
Joseph Chamberlain.
The famous, South African is to make
his fight under great disadvantage. He
has not now the prestige of brilliant nnd
unbroKen success to -dazzle the eyes ol the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 31, 1897.
world he had a short time ago. The
Jameson raid has discredited him in the
eyes of ttiose who worship success as much
as in the minds of those who condemn
lawless aggressions and judge men by the
morality as well as by the result of theii
actions. He has therefore something
more than "unctuous rectitude" to fight
against when he meets his foes in the bat
tle before him, and it will require all his
courage to bear up against the clamor of
indignation that now rages around him.
The outcome of the contest will affect
more than the fortunes of Mr. Rhodes and
any distinguished champion who may
come forth to fight him. The leadership
of the strong man powerfully affects the
minds and hearts of all the ardent, ambi
tious ana aggressive young men ol Cape
Colony. They share his desire to lay the
foundations of a great nation In South
Africa and they look to him as the one
man who has tho intellect, the resources
and the will to do it. Such a man with
such a following and with such opportuni
ties is never beaten until he is dead or
sent to St. Helena. In his fortunes,
therefore, all Africa is concerned, and
through Africa he affects tho world.
RAILWAY STATISTICS.
That the railways of America form a
great part of our industrial system is
known to all, but probably few, except
those who have examined the official
statistics, know how vast a part it
realiy is. According to recent reports
about one-fifth of the total wealth of the
Nation is invested in railways. As assets
of the vast dominions of the United States
they are second in importance only to the
farms, and to those they are almost equal.
The farms represent thirteen thoupaud
million dollars, and the railway valu
ation is twelve thousand millions. The
amount invested in manufactures is only
half what is in railways. The great army
of railway employes count upward of
three-quarters of a million. Before the
reduction enforced by the present hard
times they numbered a hundred thousand
more, and with the return to normal
prosperity they would quickly increase to
a million.
This million of men includes only those
strictly employed by the reads. If an
estimate were made of those who find
remunerative occupation as the result of
railway prosperity in carshops, loco
motive works, blast furnaces, railmills,
not to mention the immense industries
less directly dependent on the roans, the
total count would show how closely inter
woven railway interests are with the gen
era! prosperity of all the people. Railway
companies have been aptly said to be
great distributers, not only of freight and
passengers, but of money.
The statistics of the Interstate Com
merce Commission show that in years of
forced retrenchment the main part of the
reduction of railway expense is taken from
the expenditure* for keeping up the road
bed, structures and equipments. The re
sult of this is pointed out by H. T. New
comb of the United States Agricultural
Department as sure to be great impair
ment of railway service. It is a sort of
false economy, which is only resorted to
when forced upon the roads, and the re
sult of its continuance is inevitable de
struction, r*; :â ]. ' '
By the most recent reports of the statist
ics of railways compiled for the United
States Government it is stated that 70 per
cent of all the outstanding -stocK of the
railway corporations paid nothing in 1895.
Nearly one-iiftn of the bonds were also un
profitable. It is estimated that nearly
one-half of the 'railway investments of
this country are unproductive, and $5,000,
-000,000 are known' to be so. The reduction
ol rates from 1890 to 1895 equals a loss of
revenue of over $100,000,000. '
A comparison of our railway rates with*
foreign rates is briefly put in the state
ment of George H. Blanchard in his testi
mony before the Interstate Commerce
Committee of tie United States Senate
that had American railways collected the
lowest of European charges they would
have received $370,000,000 more than they
did.

GARFIELD`S CABINET.
How Senator Kirkwood Came to Be Selected
as a Member of It.
The late Justice Miller of the Supreme Court
once told me, writes Moses P. Handy in the
Chicago Times-Herald, how President Garfield
at the last moment was led to make an impor
tant Cabinet appointment.
Justice Miller recalled the fact that at the
inauguration ball he met President Garneld
in the crush of promenaders and presented to
the President a lady on his arm. The Presi
dent bowed and said a pleasant word to the
lady, nn<l then, tapping the Justice on the
shoulder, said : "By the way. Judge, what do
you th.uK of Gresham for Secretary of the In
terior?"
"He is an Admirable man for that or any
other place. Upright, able and industrious,
ana has had a fine record on the bench."
"And what do you say to Kirkwood for the
same place?"
'Well, Mr. President, that is hardly a fair
question after my irank answer to the other.
Bui when you speak of Kirkwood you touch
me on a weak spot. We have known each
other all our lives, and I love him like a
brother. As the war Governor of lowa he was
second to no war Governor of them all. He
has served the public in many ways and al
ways with credit and distinction. Put him
anywhere and you will not regret it."
Garheld said "thank you" and passed on.
It was then midnight of the 4th of March, and
so late as that the President was undecied as to
the composition oi his Cabinet. The next day
the nominations were sent to the Senate, and
itwÂ«s .wen ihat the decision was in favor of
Kirkwood.
1 happen to know that Wayne MncVeagh's
appointment to ihi? same Cabinet was not de
termined upon until almost as late, and whoa
I predicted it in the presence of ex-Senutor
Dorsey he wanted to bet me $1000 that Mac-
Wagh would not have a portfolio, and that if
any l'ennsylvunian were appointed it would
be Wharton Barker.
HE SAVED THE GRANT BILL
Ex-Coneressrnan James Wilson of lowa, who,
it is believed, will be the next Secretary oi Ag
riculture, was the central figure of a dramatic
scene in the House at the close of tho Forty-
eighth Congress, says
the Wellington Post.
Mr. Wilson's seat had
been contested by a
Mr. Frederick, and
the case had drifted
aiong without de
ciÃion until the last
day of the session.
Even at tnat late hour
the Democrats were
eudeavorii:g to un
seat him and the Re
publicans were fili
bustering against
such fiction.

then chairman oi the
Appropriations Com
mittee, wanted the
bill passed, but Speaker Carlisle had deciclea
that the elections case was of highest privi
lege ana could not be displaced.
At twenty minutes after 11 o'clock, witnin
forty minutes oi the expiration of the session,
Mr. Wilson mounted a chair and appealed to
his Republican friends to desist from filibus
tering, declaring his willingness to be sacri
ficed rather than have the Grant bill beaten.
Amid a scene of wild enthusiasm the Re
publicans accepted his suggestion. Frederic*

STORY OF AN EDITORIAL PAGE
The gossip about John R. McLean and the
Senatorial succession in Ohio reminnds a
writer for the Washington Capital that the
Cincinnati Enquirer, which is Mr. McLean's
paper, gave up its abe editorial page in a
curious fashion. Twenty-five or thirty years
ago, when Washington McLean was alive and
a great power in Ohio and all the Middle
West, the Enquirer used to print six columns,
at least, of very heavy editorial matter. The
idea was that this sort 01 thing shaped the
destinies of the whole Ohio Valley.
There were six editorial writers in all who
contributed to this daily broadside, and they
were accustomed lo meet about 6 o'clock in
the evening to compare notes and then sepa
rate for business. Now, this story is located
on the evening of the Fourth of July, and it
happened that the six editorial writers, desir
ing to celebrate the occasion, adjourned to a
neighboring barroom to have a drink together.
It chanced that Washington McLean was al
ready there, though he had not Degun to have
anything with himself.
They were all caught, the editor and the edi
torial board together, and the only proper
thing, of course, was for the editorial board to
have one with the editor. That was done, and
the editor went home, as the editorial board
should have done, but did not. Other drinks
were ordered, and finally six editors w.-nt
home, somehow or other. One man recovered
himself sufficiently aftt-r two or three hours to
go to the Enquirer office and begin his edi
torial work.
He wrote the sentence, "Yesterday was the
Fourth of July," and left it, he knew not
whereâ perhaps on the top of his desk. Then
he went home, and woke in the morning to oe
alarmed for the satety of the whole Enquirer
newspaper. It Came out, however, and It had
a smgie editorial, and the editorial read:
'â¢Yesterday whs the Fourth of July."
Tne other edi;orial columns were filled with
news, ami the departure, which w*s thought
to be a carotully pianued coup oi journalism
by the brilliant Washington McLean himself,
made such a hit ihat editorial articles were
not thought to be of value in the columns of
the Enquirer for years afterward.

SEAMEN HELD
BY IRON LAWS
Judge Morrow's Decision
in ihe Aragon Case
Is Reaffirmed.
Sailors May Be Arrested Any
where if They Re! use to
Do as They Agree.
Ex-Judse Ferral, Attorney Hutton
and Otbers Say The Decision
Realfirms Slavery.
Thedecision of the Supreme Court of the
United States in the case o* sailors of the
private uhip Aragon has created great in
terest and considerable disappointment in
labor circles of San Francisco.
To state the case in plain Eneiish, free
from all legal verbiage, Justice Brown has
decided that if sailors sign a contract to
make a voyaee on a private ship they be
come so far bound to the shipowners that
they are subject to arrest and imprison
ment if they fail to comply with the con
tract.
The Coast Seamen's Union of San Fran
cisco, aided by unions elsewhere, is mak
ing diligent efforts to have the United
States statutes so amended as to exempt
seamen from liability to imprisonment for
failure to comply with their contracts.
While the amendment is almost certain to
become a law, the masses of workingmen
had hoped that the Supreme Court of the
United States would hold that section
4589 of the Revised Statutes of the United
States is repugnant to the spirit of Ameri
can institutions and therefore void.
It is substantially a copy of the old Eng
lish statutes on the subject. The Supreme
Court has decided, howev r, that the law
is good, though Justice Harlan wrote a
vigorous dissenting opinion.
The seamen were taken into custody in
the harbor of San Francisco on the charge
of having refused to obey the orders of the
master of the vessel Aragon, after having
entered on articles to make a voyage to
Valparaiso. They applied to the Federal
District Court !or writs of habeas corpus,
and upon the refusal of their petition ap
pealed to the Supreme Court.
Justice Brown's opinion affirms that
of the District Court and the Supreme
Court refuses to interfere with the case.
On the first point tne court held that the
arrest of the sailors under the circum
stances was "a due exercise of jujiual
uower," and also held that no involun
tary servitude was involved in compelling
seamen to serve lor me time a reed upon.
The term "involuntary," Justice Brown
said, "must attach to the inception of the
service." It would be as culpable that
soldiers should desert on the eve of battle
as tnat seamen should decline to obey
orders issued to them at sea.
Justice Harlan dissented in a vigorous
opinion, basing his division on the
ground that the arrest was in violation of
the thirteenth amendment, in that it was
an attempt to enforce involuntary servi
tude. He declared that it was an attempt
to interfere with the rights of lree men to
compel them to serve on a private vessel
contrary to their wishes. He objected to
any appeal to English precedents in this
case, saying that the two governments
were so entirely different as to render
such reference unavailing. In England,
he said, Parliament is the paramount
authoiity, and that body could wipe out
magna charta in a law of ten line?, while
the power of Congress was limited by the
constitution.
Justicb Harlan dwelt npon the fact that
the Aragou was a private vessel and that
Robertson and his companions were taken
off it to be placed under arrest because
they had asserted their rights a3
free men and refused to work. ThiÂ«,
he did not think, should be re
garded in the lignt of a criminal of
fense and. to his mind, fell clearly within
the prohibition of the thirteenth amend
ment against compelling involuntary ser
vice". There was, he said, a difference be
tween imposing conditions like these on
men like soldiers in the public service and
upon men in private employ, even though
they be sailors. He differed radically
from the court in holding that the action
of Kobctson and the other sailors was
similar to that of a soldier who should de
sert in battle, and said that the effort to
compel them by the aid of the court to
observe the terms of a contract and con
tinue their labor was more like an overseer
standing over a slave to compel the per
formance of menial service.
Again, if such a law could be enforced
in international commerce, why not in in
terstate commerce ? If men could be com
pelled to serve on ocean-goingsteamera,
why not on the river boats of the inte
rior? "Why was it more reasonable to ar
rest a seaman for refusing to labor tnan a
house servant wno made a similar re
fusal? A law providing such a penalty in
the latter event would shock every one,
yet the grounds for it would be as solid as
for the law under which this proceeding
occurred. He thought the law unconstf

tutional, and the arrest of the men con
trary to the spirit of the a>:e.
Attorney . W. H. Hutton, who has cbaree
of the case for the-sailors, was completely
discusted when he heard of the decision.
He said: "This restores slavery and i
makes the harsh old English statutes of v
hundreds 01 years two binding on the %
courts of the United States. If it holds Â»
in the case or sailors on a private vessel it
ought, by the sarre reasoning, to hold
good for a contract" to build a private
house."
Ex-Judge Robert O. Ferral said: "Jus
tice Harlan is correct, and since he has
been overruled it is time the statutes were
repealed on behu f of humanity. It is
contrary to the spirit of our laws to pun
ish a man because he will not carry out a
contract to work. This Aragon decision
reaffirms the worst features of the old im
pressment laws under which British
seamen were imprisoned everywhere and
forced to go aboard snip. That was one of
the causes that led to the War of 1812. and
it hardly seems possible that a court of
dignity has pronounced this the law to
day." ____________

Cathedral.
Among the Pall-Bearers Are Some cf

The arrangements for the funeral of
Alexander H. Loughborough are as nearly

considering the brief period of time since
his sudden death.
The remains will be removed from hi 3
late residence, at the northwest corner of
Franklin and O'Farrell streets, at 10
o'clock Monday morning to St. Mary's
Cathedral, on Van Ness avenue, where a
requiem High mass will be celebrated by

were the sentiments frequently expressed
by him during his lifetime.

MAIL ORDERS PROMPTLY FILLED. IMARGARET HUXGERFORD, better
'â  known as "The Duchess," Is dead
-3 Mrs. Hungerford was born in Ireland
in iss9. She was the daughter of the late
Key. Canon Hamilton, rector of St Faugh
nan's Cathedral, in RosÂ», Cerberry, County
Cork. Tne Hamiltons were an old and dis
tinguished family.
"Ihe Duchess' 1 was married first when quite
a young girl to a gentleman by the name of
Argles. After six years of happily married
life she was left a widow, with three little ones
depending upon her for sustenance.
She had written short stones for her own
amusement in her younger days. But it was
not until she was compelled to support her
self and her family that she adopted novel
writing as a means of livelihood.
Since then, and mat was twenty years ago,
she contributed to the press no less than
two novels a year.
In 1883 "The Duchess" married Henry
Hungeriord, the son ol a wealthy Irish land"
owner, bnt her success es a writer had been so
marked that she still wrote on. At the time of
: or death she had accumulated quite a for
tune and had a reputation wider than that of
: any a betu-r writer.
In her private life "The Duchess" is said to
have been a most charming woman. She was
surrounded by wealth and fr.ends, and she
kept ber beautiful home at St. Brendas, in the
county of Cork, full of guests. As a writer
Mrs. Hungerlord made up in quantity what
Bhe lacked in quality. Her writings are well
known, but their character is hardly to be
commended. They sold well, however. Her
firs: work, "Phyllis," was condemned by the
English critics but eagerly read by the masses.
Her last aovel, "Nor Wife Xor Mala," was
eagerly waited for, in spite of its very ques
tionable tone.
still the novels of "The Duchess" cannot be
wholly condemned. While it must be con
ceded that she took a rather poor standard to
work upon, there are touches of wit, humor
and pathos in her 6tories which go far to re
deem them from utter condemnation. Had
Mrs. Huneeriord been a highly educated
woman, with her natural brightness and in
genuity, she might hold a far higher place in
the world of literature.

The second volume of Professor Bloane's

the famous Corsican (luring the time he was
First, Consul, and the author considers the
Consulate as the period of Bonaparte's great

opens with the rescue of the Directory during
the summer of 1797, by the aid which Napo

the person of General Augereau. It closes
with the decisive defeat of the Prussians at
the battle of Jena in ISO 6. For every two

from that revealed to us in the first voiume,
and, as though roused by a loftier theme, the
writer's stylo has grown to one of more elo
quence and glow and force. Bonaparate is
still shown to us as a shrewd and unscrupu
lous intriguer, but as Consul and Emperor we
get to see him from points of view suggested by
the author which make us wonder if after all
there may not have been some hidden noble
springs unaer his vast ambition.
As early as 1797, when the helpless Directory
was seeking the aid of Bonaparte while at the
same time they dreaded his power, we ere told
that the adventurer was laying nig plans not
merely to master France but to master Europe.
So little aid the German Emperor comprehend
the man with whom he had to deal that he
offered him a bribe of a principality with
250,000 subjects.
Professor fci.oane gives us a pen portrait of
Bonaparte as he appears in Venice. It was
found among the papers of a royalist, the
Count d'Antragues, and is not flattering. A !
â  part of it runs: "Bonaparte is a man of small j
stature, of sickly hue, with piercing eyes and [
Bomething in his mouth and eyes which is j
cruel, covert and treacherous; speaking little,
but very talkative when his vanity is engaged j
or thwarted; of very j.oor health because of
violent humors in his blood. lie sleeps but '
three hours every night."
>ieakingof his playing the part of one de
voted to the principles of equality befoie the
French people, Sloane says that "his histrionic
talents, like his other gift's, were of the high-
est order."
About Napoleon's Egyptian expedition we '
ate told some interesting tnings. The French
republic had inherited the notion of world
conquest which had occupied both Philip le
Bel and Louis XIV, although in another form.
Bonaparte was full of the same idea. In one
of his conversations lie said that Europe was a
i ..olehill when compared with the 600,000,000
of men in the East. In his youth he had read
,c "Philosophical and Political History of
the Two Indies," and had therein learned to
admire Alexander the Great and to believe
that with a proper population and a firm ad
ministration Alexandria would rise to greater
eminence than London, Paris, Constantinople
or Rome. The opinions thus early formed he
never changed, and he reiterated them even at
Bt. Helena, where he said that but for his re
pulse at Acre he would have founded an
Oriental empire.
At the time of the declaration of the em
pire, Sloane says that Bonnparte had by guile
and prudence in the exercise of consummate
genius as soldier and politician climDed to
the pinnacle of revolutionary power. "Stand
ing ever at the parting of the ways, and
Indifferent to principle, he carefully con-
Bide'ed each path, and finally chose the
one which seemed likeliest to guide his foot
steps toward tho goal of his ambition. Fer
tile in resources, he strove always to conitruct
a double plan, and on the failure of one expe
dient passed easily o to another. His career has
been marked by many blunders, and he has
often been brought to a Btand on tho verge of
some abyss which threatened failure and ruin:
yet, like the driver of a midnight train, he
kept the headlight of caution trimmed and
burning."
Professor Bloane thiuks that the French peo
ple helped Napoleon to climb to power because
they saw in him the incarnation of their own
j atriotism and love of leadership among na
tions, it was because the Bourbons had
failed to represent these qualities that they
Itad despised the Bourbons. He says It is en
tirely possible that Bonaparte beiieved him
self and a dynasty proceeding from his loins
to be the best, if not the only, conservators of
the new France.
STORY OF SELF-SACRIFICE
TUB CAREER OF CANDIDAâ By Georjje
fasten. J). Applemn <fc Co.. New York. Taper.
50 cents. For sale by William Doxey, I'alace
Hotel, City.
Candida Is Introduced to us when she is a
little eight-year-old K i r \ t i n the act of rebel-'
liou against saying her prayers, because she
said her prayers were not answered. She had
been praying for a Newfoundland puppy for
ever so long and the puppy had never come.
She is allowed to wear short dresses until she
is 16 years old, and then, when she is put into
skirts, she weeps because sho can't even
jump off a gate. When her father tells
her to choose a profession she elects for first
choice that she will be a veterinary surgeon
and for second choice a cowboy of the prai
ries. Her fatlier tells her ih.-sa professions
are closed to her, and next 6he wants to be an
acrobat Finally, her loving parent com
promises by sending her off to a school
to learn to be a teacher of physical cul
ture. The tomboy develops into a wonder
fully fine woman, and after marrying a man
utterly unworthy of her she gives up her
whole life to nurse him when he has made
himself helpless by dissipation. The book
ends with the. singular sentence, "And her
I heart was satisfied, because she had flung all
I hopes of happiness away."
ZOLA'S NEW NOVEL, "PARIS."
M. Emi'.e Zola, reports the Paris correspond
ent of the Daily Telegraph, is busy at present
on "Paris," which, as is well known, is to be
the third and last of the volumes beginning
with "Lourdes." "The book," says Zola, "will
contain the whole philosophical balance-sheet
of the century; it will even be a synthesis
of the development of thought since the
Great Revolution. The capital of France will
be made in my book the capital of the intel
lectual world. Assuredly I have a respect
for foreign nations. I know what great things
i England, Germany and other countries are
; capable of. I honor the intelligence, the
ability and the enterprise of our neighbors;
but with the natural vanity of a Frenchman,
I regard my own nation as the head of the
world. It will not be a book of descriptions
I and digressions, like ' Rome.' tut will be con
â  cisc in its reproduction of the life and move
! rnent of our capital, and rapid and brief in ac
! tion. I think it will be an exhaustive repro
| duction of Parisian life."
Asked as to the probability of a novel con
taining his experiences in London, M. Zoia
said that he had not sketched out any plan of
such a work yet. He had a vivid recollection,
however, of what he saw in the British
capital, and might in time use his personal
knowledge about it In a work of fiction, the
dramatis persorae being inevitably French. "I
do not know England and the English," said
the novelist, "and could not, therefore, under
take to treat the subject from a psychological
point of view. If I were to do anything in
that way it would be based on what I saw of
London's great waterway, the Thames, which
has been the source of ali wealth, power and
grandeur of the capital of England. Whoever
has not seen the Thames cannot explain the
greatness of London, whose heart and puise
it is."
NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS.
"I must save this." So we say as we read in
our daily paper. It may be a powerful article
on some polit cal question or a new mayonaise
dressing. We cut it out, put it away some
whereâ when wanted it is usually missing,
says a writer in an English exchange.
With most of us it is a perplexing question
how best to preserve these c.ippings. It re
quires more time and patience than goes to
the average make-up to keep well-arranged
, and systematic scrapbooks. Accumulated pro
' miscuously they are almost useless. An
i acquaintance of mine has solved the problem
most charmingly. During the years of her
long life (she has celebrated her golden wed
ding) sne has made a practice of cutting out
e.nythingof interest to herself and placing it
in that book in her library treating on the
same subject. Her large library has thus be
come doubly interesting and valuable.
These unassuming bits of paper often act as
side lights, illuminating and making clearer
the original thought. As I browsed among her
books I found in a volume of Tennyson a
â ketch of the poet's life, a clipping Irom Punch
on the occasion of his knighthood, a little ex
planatory note on the worde, "bar of Angelo,"
that helped me to read "In Memoriam" more
intelligently. In "O;d Creole Days" was a
sketch of George Cable, another 01 *he French
! quarter of New Orleans and criticisms favor
-1 able and adverse to the writer. "Hymns of
the Church Militant" was tilled with these
fugitive poems, often so beautiful in senti
ment, that are read, admired and forgotten iv
the course of the day. The dictionary and a
book of quotations were receptacles for clip
pings on the origin of words or phrases. Some
times these scraps were pasted around the
margin or attached to the top of the page, but
were usually lying loose in the book. An old
copy of Alagnalls "Question" had in it odd
ities of history.
A book on natural history was greatly in
creased in interest uud in reading matter by
the host of gleanings relative to bird and ani
mal life. Parrot, snate and monkey stories
were there galore, but there was also much
relative to the iess well-known brauches of
the kingdom. Every volume of an "American
Encyclopedia" was bulged out of shapa by its
added wealth of information, the called anno
tations being often fresher and more reliable
than the main article. In taking down a
book from this library there is always the
pleasurable excitement of discovery. One
almost instinctively turns first to the clip
pings. Where much reading is done they
might be in the way, but the books from the
bookcase are not usually the reading of the
I family. Our systematic friend put few scraps
in the books most used, and her friends, ac
customed to her ways, knew where to go in
search of information. "Mother's scraps"
were a whole reference library to her family.
A CURIOUS OLD BIBLE.
James Vincent Sr. of Tabor, lowa, owns the
only copy of the "Bug Bible" in the United
States. So he writes to Librarian Stevenson
of the Alleshany Carnegie Library. There is no
direct offer of sale, but a suggestion that it
should be in some public library.
Mr. Vincent says the Bible was brought to
this country in 1843, and that it is one of only
four copies extant, the remaining three being
in English collections. He says it bears date
of 1549 and has the introduction by Miles
Coverdale. His allusion to the queer transla
tion of a word, which hits given this Bible the
name of "Bug," is correct, and if he states the
date accurately it is a more precious copy
than that generally called the "Bug Bible."
In the fifth verse of the Ninety-first Psalm the
reading Is, "Thou anal: not need to be atraid
for any bugges by night," whereas the author
ized version has "terror" for "bugges"â pos
sibly a word akin with bogie and not an old
English plural for bug.
Then Mr. Vincent alludes to this curious
note of the editor to the third chapter of the
first epistle of St. Peter, where the text al
ludes to the wife, Sara: "And il she be not
obedient and helpful unto him (he) endeavor
eth to beat the tear of God into her head, that
thereby sho may be compelled to learn her
duty and to do it." Such were sixteenth cen
tury ideas of disciplining a wife.
Mr. Stevenson says he has no fund available
for the purchase of rare editions of the Bible
tor if once begun an approach to even a fine
collection would entail a large expenditure
The "Bug Bible" has its much better known
companions, all named from typographical
errors, as the "Vinegar Bible," which calis the
parable of the vineyard that of the ' "vinegar" ;
the "Placemaker's Bible," which contains the
spoils doctrine by making placemakers, and
not peacemakers, bl>.ssed,,and notleaÂ«tx>f all,

In 1877 there was held in South Kensington.
England, the Caxton memorial celebration in
honor of the four hundredth anniversary of
Caxton's printing press. Part of the exhibition
was devoted to Bibles, and therein was a "Bug
Bible" ot 1551. It was known as the Matthews
translation, a pseudonym for John Daniel, and
the text was that of Cuverdale, the first trans
lator of the complete Bible into English from
the "Douche and L,atyn." But the bug error
is also in the Matthews edition of 1549. It was
in these days when the common people dared
not possess a Bible, and William Lyndale was
strangled to death. But what this Caxton ex
hibition solved was what, as a literary mys
tery, hua elicited inquiry for three centuries.
"Where was tho Coverdale translation
printed?" It was settled to be Antwerp, Bel
gium, and, curiously enough, that is where
Mr. Vincent's Bible was printed.

Among Christmas books which appeared in
Paris may be noted an album containing col
ored reproductions of nearly fifty water-color
drawings by M. Boutet de Monval, illustrating
the life of Joan of Arc. This information will
doubtless be of interest to many of the read
ers of San Francisco, for tne librarian of the
Mechanics' Library says the study of the life
of Joan of Arc is much in vogue here this
winter.
Anthony Hope is just finishing a sequel to
"The Prisoner of Zenda." It is a novel of the

couragement Yon Bulow owed so much In his
youth and early manhood. There are many
revelations of precocious talent in other direc

illustrate a portion of the artist's life of which
little has been known.
Many books have been written of life at sea,
Dut with the exception of one or two notable
stories they are the work of literary men who
however brilliant as writers, have used their
materials at second hand. "On Many Seas,"
recently published by the Macirailan Com
pany, is written by a sailor himself and in its
passage through the press hns been allowed to
lose nothing of its intense and sailor-like vi
tality ; and this quality is the keynote to the
book. The author has written of his life and
exploits, good and evil, as the tale of them de
mand; and he has told it with the dramatic
skill of the born storyteller.
While Harry Furniss, the able English car
toonist, is now on his second visit to this coun
try those who hear him lecture and those
who lack the opportunity will be equally priv
ileged on reading his book, "Flying Visits"
(American Publisners Corporation, New York,
cloth $1), a series of articles, illustrated by
the author, giving in a delightful manner the
humorous impressions received by him during
a travel of 7000 miles in sixteen weeks in the
British Isles. Nearly every page ol his book,
which is both descriptive and instructive, is
provocative of laughter, and the 180 engrav
ings supply excellent illustrations of the text.
An English critic, speaking of William Sloan
Kennedy's new book, "Reminiscences of Walt
Whitman," says: "It is manifest that the in
terest in Walt Whitman is deepening and that
a far different estimate is being placed on the
'good gray poet' by our best writers than that
with which Whitman's own countrymen at
first saluted his strange muse. Perhaps he
has suffered almost as much from some of his
uudUcriminating admirers as from his avowed
enemies. American men of letters forty years
ago, with the exception of Emerson, could see
nothing in the new bard of acmocracy, so that
Whitman was fain to traverse alone his own
grand and rugged way."
George W. Cable, author of "The Grandis
simes," "Old Creole Days," "Dr. Sevler," etc.,
has recently made arrangements whereby he
is to become the editor of Current Literature.
Mr. Cable has been living in NorthamDton,
Mass., for several years and has been absorbed
in the starting and spread of the "home
culture" clubs which have become so widely
known of late. With the exception
of an occasional appearance on the
lecture platform, he has had little
time left to htm lor the relations with the
public at large which have made his name so
familiar to all. Under the arrangements
which he has now made, he will have a por
tion of his time for his imaginative writing,
and will lake more special charge in Current
Literature of a department in which it is his
purpose to chat in a familiar manner with the
readers upon literary, artistic and other
topics of the day. His interest in the home
culture movement will not be lost, though he
will be unable to participate actively in the
management of it.

THE FEBRUARY MAGAZINES
Rudyard Kipling, the poet and teller of
tales, is known wherever the Englishlan^uage
Is spoken; but Rudyard Kipling, the artist, is
something hitherto undreamed of. Yet the
second (February) number of the new
literary' magazine, the Month, will have as
a frontispiece an original copyright drawing
by the famous story-teller. It Is said to pro
duce its effect by the broad methods of the
designer of decorative posters. Had Mr. Kip
ling "gone In for" this sort of thing, who
\ knows but tnat Messrs. Beardsley and Bradley
I might have had to look to their laurels?
In Module's Magazine for February H. J.
W. Dam has a particularly interesting article
on "The Making of the Bible." First it de
scribes by what strange and almost miraculous
means narratives of which the original rec
ords have utterly perished survived in fair in
tegrity through centuries of turmoil and con
fusion, and next it describes the finely
wrought, typically modern instrumentalities
and appliances by which those narratives are
to-day published to the world, in all its varied
languages, by tbe million copies through the
Oxford University Press. Pictures of the Uni
versity Press and fac-similes of early texts illus
trate the article.
The most novel tning in Scribner's for
February is the appearance of C. D. Gib
son as the writer of the notes which accom
pany his first series of sketches portraying
"Louden as Seen by C. D. Gibson." As a
writer he sees things with that fresh eye
for what is significant and picturesque in
character that marks his drawings. He in in
tensely interested in the pageant of the "Lon
don Streets," and he tells you why. His
drawings (made during his residence in Lon
don) are studies from real people and suggest
entirely new types. These articles, which
will continue for six months, add a new Gib
son gallery to the Paris and New York types
already famous.
The February number of Current Literature
has in addition to its well-filled ana interest
ing regular departments a signed article by
Hamilton W. Mabie; an appreciation by W. D.
Howells of the verse of the young negro poet,
Paul Laurence Dunbar; a page of selections
from the latter's recently published "Lyrics of
Lowly Life" ; a page of verse, the work of
Johanna Ambrosius, Germany's peasant
poet; a reading from Paul Leicester
Ford's new book, "The True George Washing
ton"; one on the punishment of authors and
books from Alice Morse Earle's "Curious Pun
ishment of Bygone Days"; a story from the
pen of Robert Cameron Rogers; another by
Shan F. Bullock, and a special article on
"Young American Writers of To-day," by Ed
ward S. Van Zile. The illustrations in the
front of the magazine have reference to the
text that follows. An interesting number.
Harper's Magazine for February is a monu
ment of the policy of exalted journalism
which has characterized it in the past, and
which is more and moro becoming the policy
of American magazines everywhere. Articles
on literary research, literary criticism, or ad
vanced thought in art and letters, thoueh by
no means entirely absent, are subordinated to
reports and discussions of tne vital interests
of modern life. Richard Harding Davis
went all the way to Moscow to report the cor
onation of the Czar and Czarina. Charles F.
Lummis presents the first of a series of ar
ticles on the Mexico of to-aay, in preparing
which he spent tnree months beyond the Rio
Grande, and Poultney Bigelow has brought
back from Cape Town a series of articles on
"White Man's Africa," the present number of
which, illustrated by Frederic Remington and
W. H. Drako from photographs taken by the
author, discusses the career of President Steyn
of the Orange Free State.
The cover 01 the February Overland Monthly
will catch the eye among a hundred others.
Mount Shasta, a Siskiyou County gold mine,
and the Overland's famous grizzly ap
pear in green and gold. Thomas
Magee contributes an article of more
than usual interest on "The Kings
River Canyon," comparing it to the Yosemites
of this country and Europe. Dr. J. H. Stallard
continues his powerful series of articles on
"Municipal Reform"; this second installment
will without doubt attract fully as much at
tention from the press as did the first. J. E.
Bennet concludes his historical sketch of the
California missions. All friends of higher edu
cation will be interested in the account of Prof.
Clement of the University of Idaho. Charles
E. Naylor, whose articles on pilotage have
attracted so much attention, contributes a
rather drastic article oa 'The New Ferry De
pot." Part 2of the Siskiyou article is heavily
illustrated, and contains a complete history of
the county. The stories of the number are
Western and the illustrations are up to the
mark.
The complete novel in the February issue of
Lippincott's is "Under the Pacific." by Clar
ence HerDert New. It taues the reader to a
part of the world he probably never heard of
before, where two extremely enterprising
Americans conduct a search for long- lost
treasure under the most unusual circum
stances.
The two " Old Friends " of whom Edith
Brower writes were far apart in age, and
one of them was musical; in fact, music
and friendship are the keynotes of the
tale. "Old Tom of Nantucket," celebrated
by Joseph A. Altsheler, was an old man-o'
war's-man in the hands of Algerine pirates,
on whom he played a judicious and most
Christian trick. M. 8. Baden, in "A Forestry
Idyl," gives a reminiscence of the great Chi
cago Fair.
"South Florida Since the Freeze" is another
of R. G. Robinson's eminently fair-minded and
instructive articles. Albert G. Evans handles
a topic of vital importance to our great West,
"Irrigation." Francis Albert Doughty writes ou
"The Southern Side of the Industrial Ques
tion."
Emily Bally Stone supplies a second amus
ing paper on "Marrying in the Fifteenth Cen
tury." "A Vanished Civilization"â that of the
Jesuits in South Americaâ is described by
Henry Granville.
"The Dignity and Humor of Signs" are dis
cussed by Agnes Carr Sage, and "Gloves" by
Elizabeth Ferguson Seat. Dr. Charles C. Ab
bott has a quaint essay on "Overdoing the
Past"
The poetry of the numbor is by. Jean Wright,
Julian Haw'.horne, Charles G. D. Roberta,
Clarence Urmy and Clinton Scollaid.
The February Issue of St. Nicholas is the
Midwinter Holiday numDer. Frances Courte
nay Baylor, whose story, "Juan aud Juanita,"
was one of St. Nicholas' pronounced successes,
begins a new serial for girls, "Miss Nina
Barrow." George Kennan, in "A Siberian
Scare," tells of his experiences in the wilds of
that country. That he was visited by a verita
ble ghost the superstitious peasant firmly be
lieved, although Mr. Kennan penetrated to
the bottom of the mystery. Julia Taft Bay no
furnishes a paper about "Willie and Tad
Lincoln," who were playmates of her brother.
She tells of their pranks in the White House
and describes what was probably the first and
only minstrel show given in that building.
The programme of the entertainir^nt, rudely
traced in Tad's youthful hand, is reproduced.
Mrs. Bayne also tells of "Mrs. Lincoln's Zou
aves," made up wholly of officer?. As a com
panion article to this is a paper on "The Birth
place of President Lincoin," by George H.
Yenowine. This has illustrations of the scenes
connected with the boyhood of the emancipa
tor. Mr. Yenowine tells a story of the rescue
from death by drowning of Lincoln by one of
his schoolmates, that Mr. Yenowine took down
from the lips of the surviving actor in the in
cident. Charles Thaxter Hill, in "An Alarm
of Fire by Telegraph," describes the won
derful fire-alarm system of New York, and
draws many stirring pictures. A sketch of child
life in the Chinese quarter of San Francisco by
Theodore Wores, the artist, is entitled "Ah
Gau's New Year's Celebration." "The Tale of
the Discontented Weathercock" is the tinal
story in "The City of Stories," by Frank M.
Bicknell. The serials, "Master Skylark,"
"June's Garden," "The Last Three Soldiers"
and "The True Story of Marco Polo" have in
teresting installments. There are many
sketches, poems and jingles in the number,
all fully illustrated.
The Century for February contains three
serials, viz., the conclusion of Marion Craw
ford's novelette, "A Rose of Yesterday"; the
fourth par. of Dr. Weir Mitchell's "Hugh
Wynne," ana tbe continuation of General
Horace Porter's recollections of Grant in the
field. The short stories are "A Man and Some
Others," a tale of the Western plains, by
Stephen Crane, and "Miss Selina's Settle
ment," a itory of New York society, by
Mrs. Burton Harrison. In addition to
these there is a touching narrative by W.
J. Stlllman of the life and death of two pet
squirrels. Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer, who
knows New York by heart, contributes an
illustrated paper on "Places in New York,"
the topics of which range from the slums to
the opera. "The Battle of Copenhagen," by
Captain A. T. Mahan, is the third of
this distinguished writer's studies of
Nelson's victories. Another illustrated
article having a curious interest is a
study of the Siberian swamp. Vendiacd, by
Charles de Kay. The paper is attractively
illustrated by Louis Loeb. "In the Desert
With the Bedouin" is the title of a psper by
R. Tftlbot Kelly, who supplies his own illus
trations. Mr. Kelly's paper is full of anecdote
and incident. A sketch of Samuel Lover,
under the title of "The Author of 'Eory
O'More'," is contriouted by his daughter, Mrs.
Fanny Schmid, mother of Victor Herbert, the
musician. Julian Hawthorne contributes a
second short paper on Jamaica, entitled "A

FASHION`s DECREES
Thea'er toilette of lavender cloth with pold embroidered brocade bodice. Thla en
tlrely novei design has the upper portion cut in bolero shÃre ar.d <=hort enough to display &
wide draped waist band of lavender satin. The puffs on the medieval sleeves are of satin to
match also the pieated ruff Fupponing the Elizabethan frill around the neck. Pleated satin
fills up the square openings at the top of the bodice.
"BS!SyNGLISH society nas now a new fad.
-Â§â * ;&â  It is the spinning-wheel, and it is
â â â**;" pleasing to note that the fad in this
instance is useful, for its readoption has
not been brought about to. ornament the
household, but to give our lymphatic and
sometimes lazy society women something
that is pleasing to do. The spinning
wheel has been reintroduced by the Prin
cess of Wales, and since that time* the
craze has spread until a fashionable Eng
lish home is not complete without one of
these ancient contrivances.
The Duchess of Fife makes use of her ;
wheel to spin the yarn with which she aft
ward knits her hatband's golf stockings,
and it can safely be said that next season
will see our "upper-ten" bicyclists wearing
homemade hose, which, of course, will be
far superior in quality to the store goods,
even the most expensive kind.
For my part I think the fad an excellent
one, and every one knows a spinning
wheel is a most decorative object.
Embroidered Collars for .New
York Swells.
Our London correspondent writes that a
celebrated London firm has brought out
and introduced the idea and design of em
broidering the collars of gentlemen's
coats for evening wear. These are being
beautifully worked,- and having seen and I
examined some of their specimens I am I
not surprised to find that they have '
proved Â»o attractive that, as I am given !
to understand, the demand for t ese em- !
broideries is almost greater than the sup- j
ply at present. The idea seems to have
thoroughly "taken," and one great merit
greatly to be appreciated is that it is not
likely to be copied by any but the rich,
owing to the increase of expense due to
the artistic decoration and design. The
turned-back collar is lined and covered
with a rich black corded silk of the best
quality, and on this is traced original and
artistic designs, which are then exqui
sitely embroidered with black silk purse
twist, forming a charming decoration
when finished. As yet no colors are in
troduced. These embroidered collars
should certainly be seen and worn by all
those who wisn to be up to date in dress.
They are a very great improvement on the
usually uninteresting dress coats that
have been worn for so long. A visit to a
swell New York tailor has elicited the fact
that he has received already a number of
orders for these embroidered collars.
.New fiowns That I .Have
Seen.
If you could only have been at my side
when I inspected a number of new gowns
that a friend of mine has just brought
nome from Paris 1 am sure the slight
spark ot envy you possess would have de
veloped into a large- flame. They
were all marvels of beauty. My friend is
noted for her good taste, and under no cir
cumstances will ever wear anything that
is not the very latest style, and having a
purse long enough to gratify her whim â
as the men call it â she has. of course, a
most modern wardrobe. Her recent visit
to the gay French capital was made, with
the express purpose of inspecting and se
curing the latest models, and in this way
she spent two weeks in Paris.
The skirts of these gowns are, Jn nearly
every case, most elaborately trimmed.
This latter style is thr only fault that I
found wit i the toilettes, and this because
they would not show lo advantage the
figure of a small woman. And we must
consider the smail woman in giving the
Blamp of approval to any style that is to
reien, for there are quite a number of
them, myself included.
Dress of Venetian Clotft.
The lirst of the gowns I inspected was of
Venetian cloth, in a new shade of grass
green. It had three bands of chinchilla
by way o! trimming, arranged in deep
Vandyke points, the bands being about a
quarter ol a yard apart and encircling the
skirt in a horizontal direction. The
bodice is not like anything I ever saw be
fore. It has a deep corselet of jeweled
â pa i sementerie on cream satin, small
emeralds repeating the green of the cloth,
surrounded by a mass of tiny brilliants
and silver seqains. Sequins, by the way,
are becoming daily more fashionable.
But to continue witn the gown. Below
the jeweled cortelet there are some quaint
I ittle baques of cloth bordered with chin
chilla, while above there is a cloth bolero,
very trimly cut and edged withchiuchilla.
Around the armholes are gray bands of
â oft gray iur, while epaulettee of plain
cloth and very full are uf a somewhat dif
ferent shade of green. The sleeves fit
quite tightly from the shoulder to the
wrist, a sure warning that the day of the
balloon sleeve is over. The center of the
front of the bodice is finished in the dain
tiest manner imaginable, wi:h a bow ol
white satin at the mroat and a jabot of
fine cream !ace, a second bow of the satin
being placed where the jabot ends. Alto
gether the composition is a masterpiece,
and makes a superb toilette for a woman
with dignified carriage. I suppose that I
should look a "fright" in it, and I must
confess that I found some comfort in the
thought.
1. Princess gown of blue figured mousgeline fle l'lnde over silk. The laca yoke and lower part of sleeves. The ribbon over the shoulden and the sash bow at the back Is pale blue.
2. Embroidered mull gown pale blue ground with printed and embroidered white figures. LÂ».ce yoke and blue tafleta neck and waist band. 3. Challie dresg white ground and lavender
figures trimmed with lace ruffles. Lavender latin ribbon at neck and waist. Large pearl buttons.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 31, 1897.
Anotner gown is made most effective
bj' the graceful use of astrakhan, the skirt
being of sapphire blue cfoth arranged in a
series of graduat d panels, each edged
with strips of far running from the waist
to the hem. A deep band of dark blue
velvet encircie3 the waist, the upper part
of the bodice being of China silk arranged
in deep lucks running horizontally and
designed to have the appearance of scat
tered cornflower blossoms and green,
leaves on a foundation of the palest tea
rose yellow. Strange to say there is noth
ing but the most perfect h-trmony in these
shades. The dainty bodice is half con
cealed under a double bolero of dark blue
clotb, each zouave being edged with as
trakhan and cut into a sharp point. The
leaves are cut in three leaf-like epau
lettes cut in points like the bolero and
edged with a tiny str>p of fur.
The tailor-made gown of the collection
of nut-brown cloth has a skirt that fits
close.'y to the figure from the waist (o the
knees. It is trimmed just below the knees
with three bands of sable, the fur encir
cling the skirt and the bands being about
six inches apart. Below the bottom row
of fur is placed a full deep flounce of
brown clotb, which sets off a pretty foot
in a most charming manner. The bodice
is made in a tight-fitting shape with
short full basques bordered with sable
and neatly cvi cloth re .'era edged with
sable and turned back to show a waistcoat
of Louis Seize brocade, the floral design
being worked cut in small silver sequins.
This is a model that will suit almost any
kind of figure and it is a particularly
smart-looking model.
Tbere were also two loyoly princess
dresses. Now a princess gown i 3 one of
the most perfect styles of dress if there is
a perfect figure underneath or if a figure
can be mede shapely by judicious pad
ding; but such a garment on a woman
who is naturally angular and thin to my
mind is & perfect abomination. We in
America, I am pleased to say, are awaie
o f all these things, but Dame Fashion al
lows us to dress accordingly as long as we
keep within range of (he leading styles.
The styles of princess robes are being car
ried over into the summer gowns, and for
those who can wear them I cannot rec
ommend anything prettier.
â¢New Styles in Corsets.
No article of apparel owned by women
should be so carefully studied as the cor
set, for on it depends the style arid fit of
every gown they w.'ar; so let this b3 care
fully notid, that it has of iate undergone a
most decided change, and a very low bust
is now a necessity if one would be in the
least in style. In fact, many of fashion's
leaders are wearing a French corset wnch
is lone below tho waist line, out extends
only about three or four inches above that
iine, allowing the bust to remain in its
natural position, thus imparting beautiful
lines to the figure, unknown during the
days when women even of the most gen
erous proportions insisted upon havinc
their bosoms forced into the most un
natural positions, so that, they protruded
from under their chins and gave them a
simply dreadful stuffed appearance, en
tire.y out of keeping with any and all
ideas of symmetry, and many a case of
cancer may be traced to just such un^
natural and absurd methods. I am not
writing so plainly because I r.ave heard of
such cases; I positively know of more
EXQUISITE 1897 SUMMER GOWNS.
than one. And lam not advocating the
banishment of the corset, as I approve
of it in most cases; but this new model I
hope to see in some of our stores ere long,
as the resu ts to be obtained by wearing
it are productive of so much good
and are largely appreciated by New
York's best-tnrned-out women. Calve is
said to be responsible for the change, and
besides a very low bust, a perfectly
straight line down the front with no curv
ing in at the waist, and an unfettered
springiness over the hips are demanded of
every well-made woman. And now that
the best corsets are to be had in at least
twenty different models tbatinciude a!
mosi every figure, the high and low bust,
the small and large hip, the long and
short waist, etc., I advise you all to first
try and see if you cannot find what you
desire "ready made," and this is the first
time I have ever giv n such counsel, as it
is a well-known fact that no French
woman ever thinks of incasing herself in
a corset not especially mado to order, and
the results are beyond criticism; but the
very worst corset I ever put on was made
to order, cost |16, was of plain coutille and
did not fit at all, even after boing sent
back twice for alterations, and besides
wa< hideously uncomfortable, so I snail
in future not give any more suggestions of
this character; but before purchasing the
ready-raale article be sure to have it tried
on by an experiencsd fitter before having
it sent home, as insensibly your figure
changes and one size larger or smaller
means a greater amount of com
fort in jpany cases; and tills per
formance need not be gone through
with frequently, for all who can afford it
order at least three pairs at once, as con
stant changes from one to another keeps
the fi^urÂ« in proper shape and goes a long;
way toward preserving the gir.lish curves
and springy outlines of the figure. Al
ways when possible, change your cor
set for the evening when you do your
dress. This used to be a necessity, but
with the lowered bust it will be so no
longer. However, you will be repaid for
your exertion if you do so, as corsets last
much longer when not required to do con
stant service.
Real whalebones and the best contille
mako excellent corsets, which may be had
for $6 on!y. When you can afford it have
your corsets match your silK petticoats, as
they are both pretty and fashionable,
nevertheless it Is a treat mistake to put
all your money into a single pair, for one
of the secrets of keeping your figure young
and elastic is never to allow yourself to
wear a corset after it becomes stretched
and soiled, as a corset is never thoroughly
satisfactory that has been washed or
cleaned, and one writer says in her advice
to society women and girl 3 concerning
corsets: -'Economize elsewhere rather
than limit yourself to two or three a year.
Six corsets, including negligee, bicycle
and evening wear, ought, however, to
carry one very comfortably through a
twelvemonth." Slender women are made
the proper size and shape by little light
weight pads composed of the very finest
or fine hair that comes from Paris direct
already shaped so as to fill in every possi
ble gap or scoop in hip, shoulder-blade or
bust. These are perfectly adjusted inside
the corset.
All plump women are wearing the
most elastic in stays, that fit almost like
the skin, far the day has *:one by when
heavy cloth, steel and bones are employed
10 compress the flesh in one direction,
thus causing it to bulge out in an absurd
manner where il was never intended to
obtrude. Tne weight and thickness of
such a corset adds materially to the size
and tremendously to the discomfort of the
unfortunate wearer. Now instead are
patronized thin, light-weight corsets of
coutilie and whalebone, built nut in all
necessary parts with Kuithel elastic,
woven like stockinet, but as lirni as can
vas. Such stays are low in the bust, long
below the waist line, and when necessary
slit and laced over the Dips, with a band
of elastic silk strapped securely over the
abdomen. Such models hold the body
properly and yet admit of much comfort.
Several new models have lately been
1. Evening gown of black and white striped silk with a floral pattern In white meander
ing dowu each stripe. The bodice has a vest oi roseate silk, lightly draped with lisse, aiudded
with silver sequins, and over each shoulder is a fold of roseate velvet, tied at the top into a
bow.
2. Evening dress ot pale pink net over pÂ«lest pink satin, trimmed with frilli edged with
Valenciennes lace. The bodice Is made of pleated net and trimmed with the frills and iace
again, tied with ribbon. It is soit .-.nd dainty to a degree.
created in golf and bicycle corsets. One
has bands of elastic ribbon under the
arms, a broad band of silk elastic over the
abdomen, and fastens in front by means
of books, over which a lacing passes. An
other is made entirely of bands of elastic
ribbon, fitted in at the hips and bust by
means of gussets and coutille. Such are
very satisfactory for those; who never be
come overheated when riding or golfing,
but those who perspire freely should se
lect the waist from winch the bones may
be removed readily, bo that it can be easily
wasiied.
The little dainty Empire corsets find
many admirers, but these frequently
amount to nothing more tnan a bust sup
porter, but are delightful combinations of
silk, lace and ribbons. Some are only
strips of satin ribbon fitted inio the figure
by means of boned gussets of satin. Others
are of light silk covered with lovely lace,
slightly boned, with a tiny frill over the
bnst gathered in at the top with a ribbon.
All are completed with shoulder straps of
bright ribbon. Evening corsets are indeed
marvels of beauty, and nnmberJess are the
combinations of embroideries, laces, silks,
satins and brocades. Makckua.
For the Men.
Quits remarKable and very ugly are
some of the latest cats, some of thederbys
being high-crowned and square, others
are almost brimless â two absurd extremes.
Very foolishly many fashionable tailors
early in the season laid in a large stock of
satins and brocades, especially white,
adorned with Sowers and butterflies.
These quaint fabrics they have been try
ing to dispose of for waistcoats, telling all
their patrons most impressively that they
are to be the fashion this season. How
ever, all their efforts have been in vain,
for no well-tarned-ont man has been seen
in one of them. Neith9r has the ridiculous
velvet collar been Been on any correct
evening coats.
The straight standing collar is now
most fashionable, and still the club bow is
a 9 much worn as the puff or the four-in
hand. Among the new material for the
puff that having a dark green background
sprayed either with buttercups or golden
rod is best liked. Sometimes the flowers
are in pink instead of yellow, and occa
sionally minute garlands of flowers or
bows of ribbon are shown on appropriate
ly colored silks. Dartc blue and red sur
faces are in ereat voÂ»ue; when adorned
with minute designs in either white or
black, the smallest of marguerites are ef
fective.
Brown and drab spots are declared to be
smart. White ones are never seen.
Patent-leather walking-boots are always
buttoned and the toe is round, the tooth
pick style having vanished many moons
ago. Boottrees of aluminum have long
been used in England, and now we tinder
stand their many advantages. Among
others, they occupy a very small amount
of room, are very light and extremely
durable. C. C.

EATON'S ATTACHMENT.
Hli Proceeding* Against Horencs
Biythe Hinckley -miHined by
Judge Belcher.
Judge Belcher has handed down a de
cision in the case of John D. Eaton against
Florence Biythe Hinckley in which the
motion for dissolving the attachment
against her property is denied.
Mrs. Hinckley's attorney contended
mat the repayment of $25,000 borrowed
from Eaton was contingent on the suc
cess of Mrs. Hinckley in securing the
property known as the Biythe block, and
that Mrs. Hinckley had not complete
legal possession at tbe time the attach
ment was served because several appeals
were pending in the Supreme Court. Fur
thermore it was urged that the attach
ment was improperly issued because
Eaton had an equitable hen on Mrs.
Hinckley'ri interest in the property.
Jiulse Belcher brushes aside these ob
jections and holds that Eaton is entitled
to maintain this course for the purpose of
getting his money which was iurnisheit
for tho purpose of carrying on the litiga
tion that finally resulted in securing the
Biythe estate property for Mrs. Hincklev.
In Judg â  Slack's court yesterday the
case was called up and it was agreed that
the trial should begin on the 23d of next
month.
HENDY'S INVALID TRUST.
Judge CofTey Kecognlzes the Demand
of Josephine Green in the Heady
Estate.
In the Joshua Hendy estate yesterday
Judge Coffey declared invalid a provision
of the will which attempted to establish a
trust fund.
In the original draft of the will the tes
tator declared that Josephine Green
should be entitled to $5000 in cash, in addi
tion to other interests in the estate. A
codicil was added directing that the
money should be held in trust by Mrs.
Green for the benefit of her children until
they reached the age of 25 years.
Following the decision of the California
Supreme Court, JudtÂ»e CofTey decided that
tnis attempted trust is invalid and ths
original provision of the will remains in
force.THE DOG THAT SAVED T.WO HOMES FROM THE FLAMES.
THIS DOG PUTS OUT FIRES.
% Cocker Spaniel Wkich Has SaVed TWo
Homes by the Most NoVel J^lethods.
EVEJI E.NTERJS OBJECTION TO MM S.MOKLNG CIGJIRS
Nevertheless, j4e Is J^ot a Fireman's fet â EVery House Dog Should
/\dd His Accomplishment to That of Gatching Burglars.
Money Gannot Buy Jhis JWe Ganirve.
W!ILHE only doz in this country that
t-l" o makes a practice of putting out fires
t?*rC7 it owned by H. 11. Buros of Tra
verse City, Mich.
The animal is a pretty cocker spaniel,
Baby by name, and not only does be put
out fires, but he goes about it with a dis
play of intelligence which many a human
being mi^ht envy or use with advantage.
Money cannot buy this J it tie dog from
his owner. On two occasions he did the
â work of a paid fire department, saving his
master's home from the results of a disas
trous blaze, and on another occasion he
did a like service for a neigh Dor whose
house took fire while the family was in
another part of the house. Only for
the prompt action of the dog the house
would have burnt down.
The one particular trick, how-ever, which
has made Baby the pride and admiration
of the entire city of Traverse is the man
ii - '.:i which he puts out fires. Fire in
L::\- -hape is something which he does not
I jvc, and even as a puppy he showed
rae most pronounced dislike for it. The
lighting of a match anywhere near him
wa3 a sure signal for a series of growlsand
vigorous attempts on his part to reach the
offending flame and putting it out by hit
ting it with his paw.
This peculiar trait was encouraged in
the dog, and he soon became to feel that
it was his duty to put out every fire he
saw. However, he seemed to know, in
tuitively, that a fire in a stove or grate
>as not to be interfered with.
Recently Mr. Burns and his family had
occasion to go away from home for a short
time, leaving Baby in charge of the house.
He had often acted in the capacity of
housekeeper before and everybody felt
perfectly safe in leaving him on the watch.
Just what happened during the family's
absence is not known, but a passing neigh
bor saw smoke coming out of an upper
window of the house and heard furious
bark.ng from the inside.
Forcing an entrance the neighbor found
the house filled with smoke and Baby
rolling about on tne floor in the act of ex
tinguishing the last flame of what had
evidently been a good-sized blaze.
There was a big hole burnt in the car
pet where a coal had evidently snapped
out of the grate and started the fire, and a
goodly portion of Baby's long silken hair
was singed. The dog, however, did not
appear to mind that, for, when the last
bit of flame was extinguished, he jumped
up and showed eVTy evidence of being
well satisfied with himself and his work.
Baby's other experience as a local fire
department was in the house of a neigh
bor whom Mrs. Burns waa visiting. The
dog was with her and, for a few moments,
was left alone in a room in which there
wps an open grate fire.
attention of the occupants was at
'Wi Ito the room in which the dog had
neeh left by bearing him growling and
knocking the furniture about. On enter
iner the room Baby was found with a
small rug in his mouth drawine it bade
and forth over a small portion of the car
pet which had been set on fire probably by
a live coal.
For these two acts of unusual intelli
gence Baby is the pride ol everybody in
Traverse and should anything unfortunate
happen to him the entire community
would feel it was a personal loss.
On another occasion Baoy put out a
small blaze in an entirely different man
ner. A gentleman was sitting in a store
near the dog'a home ho:ding a lighted
cigar in his hand. Baby went into the
store, and, catching sight of the lighted
cigar, ne stole quietly up behind the gen
tleman, and with a quick stroke of his
paw sent the cigar flying across the room,
where he proceeded to extinguish it by
repeatedly striking it With his paw.
In appearance Baby is an unusually
handsome doe;. He has long, silky, black
hair, and eye* that sparkle with intelli
gence until he looks as if he could speak if
he only would.
from the very first day that Babyâ then
a nuffy ball of wavy black hairâ became a
menuer of the Burns household he
showed evidence of unnsual intelligence
fcij^ ability to learn. As he grew older
si*' tricks as sitting niÂ« and begging for
svwtt -;a, playing aead, sneezing and bring
ing his master's Bliopers seemed a part of
his natural instinct; but in addition to
these ordinary tricks Baby acquired of hiÂ»
own accord a number of tricks in which
he seemed to take delight, especially
when he got an opportunity of showing
them to an admiring crowd.
For some unknown reason Baby has an
inherent dislike of a lawn sprinkler, and
whenever the hose is attached and the
water turned over his master's lawn the
dog invariably starts a most terrific dis
turbance, and will attack the innocent
â hose in a most energetic manner, evi
dently laboring under the impression that
biting and shaking the hose will stop the
! flow of water.
Just why he has this firm and deep
rooted dislike for an unoffending iawn
sprinkler no one has ever been abie to dis
cover, but it is something which he evi
dently cannot overcome.
His various and exciting experiences
have not cowed him in the least, and he
iust as ready as over to light another fire
or hose, and it has recently been suggested
that he be made an honorary member of
the Traverse Fire Department.

Our Embassador to London receives the
largest salary paid to American Embassa
dorsâsl7,sooâthe same amount only being
paid to the Embassadors to France, Ger
many, Russia and Mexico, says the Phila
delphia Ledger. Sir Julian Pauncefote,
the representative of the British Govern
ment in Washington, which is considered
a smaller diplomatic post, of course, than
that at Paris, Berlin cr St. Petersburg,
and, of course, carries smaller emolu-
I ments and perquisites, receives $32,000 and
the house and grounds, which are owned
by the British Government. Besides this
there are other perquisites allowed for
horses and servants, all of the latter being
Englishmen, and most of them having
lived in Washington through the adminis
trations o f several Ministers and Embassa
dors. The American Em bassador lives in a
house which he rents furnished. This has
a disadvantage in the face that for social
purposes every four years m akes a change
in the American Embassy and suggests, per
j haps, to the average Englishman the idea
I that the American Embassy is not a per
manent institution. However this may
be, the American Embassador does not
dare to purchase a house for the use of an
embassy and residence combi ned, for fear
âa contingency most Jikelyâ that hi 3 suc
cessor would not be wiilin g, or could not
afford, even if he wished, to take it off hia
hands at the end of tne administration.
Congress, however, is not sensitive to ap
pearances. The Jeffersonian simplicity
which characterizes its deliberations is
felt in this way throughout the wcrla.
In France the situation is the same.
Several men, because of the lack of for-
I tunes of their own, have declined the
honor of serving as Etnbassadors to Paris,
because they knew that if they did they
would return at the expiration of their
terms bankrupt. In London the difficul
ties are pernaps greater than in Paris. If
the American Embaasador has a large
family and the women go out into society,
each recsption 19 most expensive to the
Embassador. If the Queen holds a draw
ing-room, or the Brinca of Wales a
leveo, all of the members of the
diplomatic corps are invited and are
supposed to be present. So great is the
necessity for preserving the entente
cordiale that all of our representatives to
foreign countries are instructed by the
Secretary of State, as far as may be con
sistent with their other duties and their
time, to use all tact and discretion in pre
serving personal friendly relations with
officers of the Government. Therefore, it
is a rare occasion when certain represen
tatives of the American United States
Embassy do not appear at these drawing
rooms or levee 3. If the Erabassafior has
a laree family and several daughters to be
presented at court, the gowns necessary
for the occasion, which all must be of a
prescribed fashion, with a long train and
veil, cost in themselves a small fortune.
In addition to this the wife of the Em
bassador is supposed not to appear twice
at a drawing-room in the same court
gown. Then there are little dinners and
big dinners, small receptions and crushes
to be given, in the thoueht of the pay
ment for which ihere should be no m iserlj
scruples, such as cannot but be fostered
by the policy of this Government. And
not only is the Em bassador and his fam
ily affected by the necessities of the situ
ation, but all of the attaches and their
families, if they have them, suffer as well.
As a matter of fact only men of means can
for a moment consider the offer of a diplo
matic post at any of the creat European
capitals. Some of them are taken by men
of means with social aspiration?, and, at
men of means are not necessarily raen
versed in the intricacies of international
law or always diplomats in the European
sense of the term, the policy cannot be
considered a wise oue.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 31, 1897.
A BIG MOUNTAIN
Springs at Engineer EdWard G. DepeWof the Qreat Northern While
Crossing a High Jrestle and JMakes Battle in jMid Air.
O.NE OF TJiE MOST TJiRILLLNG EPISODES EVER EXPERIENCED OH TJIE RJIIL.
Jhe Fierce Beast Leaped at the Engine and Js'arrov^ly Escaped Grashing Through the Gab WindoW.
Jhe Horrifying Scene ViVidlvj Described by the BraVe JYlan Who passed
Jhrough the Jerrible Night Ordeal.
Â«F* O BATTLE with a huge mountain
â &|Â£^ lion seven feet in length and 253
(jJLf^ pounds in weight on a trestle at
night is the thrilling experience that has
jutt befallen Edward C. Depew. an engi
neer on the Great Northern Railroad-. It
all occurred near Loewell, Wash.
The fierce beast leaped at the engine
and narrowly escaped crashing thronch
the window of the cab. Altogether the
episode was one of the most exciting that
a railroad man has ever experienced.
A Gall correspondent, acting on in
structions, finally prevailed upon Engineer
Deuew to write an account of hid adven
ture, believing that additional interest
would be lent by the fact of the story com
ing from his own pen.
Mr. Depew's statement is as follows:
"I was the engineer in charge of engine
219 of the Great Northern, which was at
tacked by a monster cougar or mountain
lion. You can have little idea of tho hor
ror of the experience. The glistening of
the beast's eyes, as it lay crouched on the
rails all prepared to make its powerful
spring, was awful to behold. 1 irankly
confess that I was so frightened that my
hair seemed to stand on end. 1 would
have shouted, I am sure, if I had not been
too terrified to do so.
"At the time of the adventure I was pull
ing the overland passenger train eoing
East, and as we were a few minutes late
we were trying to make up a little time.
After we had Jeft Lowell and almost two
miles east of there, about half way across
a long trestle, my fireman, George Law
rence, jumped down off his box seat and
came quickly to my side of the engine. I
noticed a startled look on' bis face, and
turned quickly, asking what was the mat
ter. The intensity of the situation can
be understood only by a man who has
traveled on an engine dashing at a high
rate of speed through the darkness, with
only con fidence to keep his mind at ease.
I knew that something was wrong, and it
seems as if in that one short minute a
million thoughts flashed through my
mind. Again 1 asked Lawrence what was
tbe matter, but he did not speak. His
eyes seemed fixed. All he could do was
to glare through the window of the cab
and point ahead.
"A cold perspiration broke out on my
brow. I looked ahead and saw, through
the darkness, some black looking object
on the track. My first thought was ol"
some obstruction on the track. Fora sec
ond the thought of jumping flashed
through >my mind, but I banished it.
"This takes quite a while to tell, but it
couid only have been a few seconds at the
most in which it all happened.
"As soon as I saw the obstruction on
the track, I felt that a possible accident
was nt hand. Nothing could be done.
We were too close to tbe danger, and the
fright had the same effect on me that it
had on Lawrence. It took away my power
of speech. Instinctively I crawled out of
the cab on to the side of the engine.
"The train dashed on, and an instant
after I had discerned the form I saw the
monster's eyes flashing through the dark
CAUGHT ON THE TRESTLE, THE LION HURLED HIMSELF AT THE ON-COMING ENGINE.
ness, green and yellow by turns. Law
rence was still in the cab, speechless, with
fixed eyes, and finger outstretched toward
the' animal. His expression was frichtful
to look upon. Tlie whole scene was so
horrifying that it was photographed on
my brain so clearly as to make me able to
describe every detail that occurred ia
those few short seconds.
"As the train approached the lion I
could see it prepare to spring, and finally
when the leap was made the situation waa
so dramatic as to be almost theatrical in
effect. The headlight of the engine threw
its rays on the crouching animal, and
when ii plunged into the liooa of light it
looked as if its mission of death would
surely be successful.
"The force of the jump was astonishing,
and as the body ox the beast crashed into
the edge of the engine-front the sound
echoed through the silence a?ain and
again. To jump then was certain death,
for we were ritrht in the center of the tres
tle, and yet, as the lion made its leap, I
could almost feel its hot breath on my
throat.
"When the engine crashed into the beast,
or it crashed into the engine, whichever
way you wish to put it, the lion fell back
on to the trestle, writhing as if in frignt
ful agony, and then for the first time 1
realized that the danger was over.
"I learned afterward that the cougar,
after we struck it, lodged in the cross-ties
of the trestle. It was found there by the
train crew of engine 498, who picked it up
and brought it to Skykomish. There it
was skinned. The claws were taken by
some of the other liremen and engineers,
who had watch charms made of them,
which are very attractive and look some
what like the emklenis worn by Knights
Tempiar.
"The beast was still alive when the men
of No. 498 discovered it, but its hind legs
were cut off, and when the men got down
to investigate they kept at a safe distance
until it. was known to be dead. In fact.
Foreman John C. Wright would not go
near it until he nad emptied a couple of
chambers of his revolver into it. Then
they fastened it to the cowcatcher and
took it to Skykomish.
"This is the whole story, and I can as
sure you I do not want to pass through
another sucli experience."
Engineer Depew it a tine specimen of
manhood, and his statement that he felt
frightened is not looked upon in Lowell,
where he is known, as an expression of
cowardice. Depew is 5 feet 6 inches in
height, weighing 140 pounds, and is well
known as the champion of the oppressed
or weaker side in any dispute that calls
for his action. His record as an engineer
has On many occasions shown' him to be
a more than ordinarily brave man.
y\r\ Imperial Jkctor.
An entertaining article in the London
Spectator is a review of the book entitled
"Napoleon's Opera-glass: an Historic
Study." In the cour=-^ of the article the
reviewer says of Napoleon: "All his great
public appearances were carefully studied
and whether he was crowning himself in
Notre Dame, visiting the camp-lires of his
army, presenting eagles to his regiments
or receiving his Ministers, he took the ut
most trouble to impress I) is audiences by
means of the actor's artifices. His glances,
his gestures, his frowns and his smiles
were all calculated.
Nor was Jbia acting confined to popular
occasions. He would, if need be, act to a
house of three or four diplomatist 3, or to
a single king or statesman, as readily as
to a crowd. He made Jittle or no secret of
the practice. For example, after an appa
rent outburst of rage he turned round to
one of his people, one of those whom it
was not necessary to impress, and who
was in the position of a dresser or scene
shifter, and explained that his fury was
not real, and that, in fact, it never reached
beyond nis neck â never got to his brain.
Perhaps, however, the best example of his
admissions in this respect is to be found
in his interview with the Pope at Fon
tainebleau:
'Napoleon met an obstinate opponent
to some of his pretensions in Pope Pius
Vil. The Emperor, accordingly, had the
Pontiff brought from Rome to Fontaine
bleau, and in the chateau at that place oc
cured the interview vivified by the poetic
art of AlJred de Vigny. We are told that
during that historic meeting Napoleon
raged and stormed as he paced the polished
floor, while Pius VII sat in a large, eagie
studded chair, attentive and calm. Na
poJeon made promises, threats and boasts.
Pius VII simply answered with one word,
'Commedianto!' Napoleon overheard the
word and was furious. 'Comedian! I, a
comedian !' l^g exclaimed. 'Ah, I will give
you comedies such as will make you all
cry like women and children! Comedian!
Ah, you are mistaken if you think to get
the better of me by insolent coolness! My
theater is the world ! The part I play is that
of manager and author. As comedians
I engage all ot you â popes, kings, peoples !
The thread by whic i I move you is â
fear! Comedian! Ah, it would take a
better man than you are to dare to ap
plaud or to hiss me!' Pius VII moved
uneasily in the chair for a moment, and
then he checked the soldier's torrent of
language with another word â 'Tragedi
ante!' Napoleon sobered in an 1 instant
aiwi continued in more subdued tones:
''Tis very true. Tragedian or comedian !
All is actinc â all has been costumed wi:h
me for a long time, and will be so for
ever! What fatigue! What littleness!

ENGINEER LITTLE AND HIS TRAVELING CAT.
TRAVELING MILLION MILES
Tke Pet Gat of the Steamer /\lameda Has

a Long-Distanca Record, and He Will Qet There
Barring Death or ShipWreck
MpERE is a cat that is striving to
f"""l:2 make a unique record. To cover
Ij^flj^ one million miles is the goal of its
ambition and that of its owner. Chief
Engineer A. D. Little of the steamer Ala
meda of the Oceanic line.
It is the most widely traveled cat in the
world. Up to the present time Tom has
covered a distance of 675,000 miles during
his wanderings, and both he and his mas
ter are living in the hope that he will be
able to reach the million mark. Inci
dentally, Tom has had many strange ex
periences. He has been battered about
and laid on the sick list more than once,
but never has this prevented him from
continuing hi 3 travels.
Tom has done most of his journeyings
on the Alameda, on board which Mr.
Little has sailed as chief engineer for over
thirteen years. The Alameda plies be
tween San Francisco, Hawaii, New
Zealand and Australia, and at every port
where the vessel touches Tom is as weli
known as the oldest salt in the service.
There are dozens of persons interested in
him, an<l many of them keep a record of
t the miles he travels, adding to the score
Whenever tho famous old feline reaches
port. On the water front at San Fran
cisco Tom is as well knownâ in fact,
better than the oldest policeman "*6n the
beat, and surely twice as well Jiked, and
at Honolulu, Apia, Auckland and Sydney
he is the lust favorite with all who fre
quent the docks. There will certainly be
general lamentation if Tom is not spared
to make his record of a million miles, but
the chances are that he will, for at present
the old cat is as healthy as he ever was.
It was not until Tom had been at sea
for ten years that Mr. Little began to
figure up the number of miles he bad cov
ered, but since that time he has kept a
careful record, and at the close of the last
voyage, when it was discovered that Tom
had covered a distance of 675,000 miles,
there wa3 general feasting among the
crew. At present the feline globe-trotter
is forging his way over the ocean, adding
more miles to his record, and, when he
left San Francisco, he looked as strong as
if he were in his prime, and so the race
between time and death goes on, with
time having the best of it up to now.
Tom originally belonged to the crew ,ci
the bark Alden Besse. He was then quite
a kitten. : This was about thirteen years
ago. One day he crawled up the gangway
of the Alameda and started to run round
the deck aa if he were anxious to start a
record for traveling. Several of the sail
ors tried to catch him, but Tom would not
be caught. He secreted himself in vari
ous parts of the ship until she went to sea,
and from that day to this he has been on
board the Alameda.
As he graw older Tom began to settle
down to business, and it was not long be
fore the upper part of the ship and the
'tween decks were perfectly clear of rats.
It was this quality that brought him so
much good luck and also a great deal of
comfort
From the moment that Tom boarded
the Alameda ho kept to himself. No
amount of coaxing could make him
friendly. He would not allow Any one to
pick him up, and if any of the sailor
tried to stroke, him he would dash off and
disappear for a couple of days. Then he
would renew his crusade on the rats.
This was the- case on the first voyag. hat
Tom took. One day he was hunting the
vermin and happened to chase a monster
rat into the galley. In his anxiety to
catch his foe Tom jumped on to the stove.
His feet were badly burned, and with a
howl of pain ha rushed out of the galley
and stovred himself away in the 'tween
docks. Engineer Little, who has always
been very fond of Tom, started for him,
groping among the cargo for several
hours, at last finding him writhing in
pain between two barrels. Little picked
up the cat and took him to his room,
dressing his feet with vaseline every day
until they were cured, and from that time
Tom has been friendly to the chief en
gineer. There are now three cats on
board the Alameda, but of course they
are not such old voyagers as Tom and he
seems to know it, lor under no circum
stances will ho allow one of the "green
hands" to walk on the t>oop. Perhaps
when they too have traveled 675,000 miles
things will be different, but now Tom is
very strong. Thirteen years of good food
and sea air have told their tale making
him one of the healthiest feline specimens
that ever went to sea.
Of late years Tom has acted as sentinel
at the door of Engineer Little's state
room, but there is something paradoxical
about his methods. He will kill every rat
that dares to make an appearance, but if
he ends the life of one anywhere else on
the ship the first thing he does is to de
posit the carcass at Mr. Little's door.
Bur tjhis wonderful traveling cat is saga
cious in other ways. He knows the sound
of a flying-fish, and never one falls on the
deck that dbes not Ihul its way to the
chief engineer's door. Flying-fash are
considered quite a delicacy at sea, but
Tom is always rewarded for his faithful
ness by being allowed to eat his captive.
The only annoying part about this pecu
liarity of Tom's is that he will often
crawl on to Mr. Little's bed and awaken
him if he has a victim's body to display.
But his master never chides him for this,
and so the old cat remains happy, at
least in this regard.
Tom has never missed a sailing day. He
is too anxious to travel. In his youuger
days he used to go ashore a great deal and
sometimes he stayed away for a day or
two at a time, but he always showed up at
muster on sailing day. Mr. Little has al
ways been at a lo3s to know how the cat
seemed to realize that the ship was about
to sail, but the fact remains that he did
so, and does so still.
At present Tom is traveling with one
ear and a half. This condition was
brought about by an encounter with a cat
in Sydney in which although Tom came
out ahead he did not do so without receiv
ing several reminders of the affray.
When Tom had finished his 6C0.000
miles of travel, his American admirers in
San Francisco presented him with a silver
collar marked with the inscription "Old
Tom, Steamship Alameda. Presented by
his American Admirers July 4, 1896."
There was considerable fun at the presen
tation. A delegation waited on Mr. Lit
tle and explained to him their mission.
Tom was escorted to the ship's saloon and
seated on a table by his master's side.
Many of the ship's company were present,
and when the speech-making began they
were all as interested as if they were listen
ing to an/oration over the body of some
fallen hero. Tom's history wus rehearsed
and due tribute paid to his superiority aa
a traveler.
Then the collar was presented. Mr.
Little in replying explained how honored
Tom felt at the distinction, and expressed
the hope that they would all meet again
after he had finished his million miles, for
which sentiment there were loud cheers.
Then the chief engineer explained that if
it was not for the fact that all present
were known to De true friends of Tom, he
would feel, to some extent, that an insult
had been offered in the gift, inasmuch as
Tom was well known to be a gold cat.
However, he continued, Tom would wear
his silver collar on all state occasions,
though it Ujust not be expectea that ho
would change his poiitical views. After
the ceremony was over a light luncheon
was served, in which Tom joined, and
after his health had been drunk sevejal
times, the party disbanded. But it was a
proud day for Engineer Little, who thinks
as much of his pet as he docs of anything
in the world.
Tom's friends in Sydney have asked the
privilege of presenting, him wich a gold
collar when he has finished his million
miles, and it la expected that theie will bo
great rejoicing when the event comes off.
A JYivjstery of Arithmetic.
It was interesting to read about the
gentleman who, at a Sunday-school meet
ing last Sunday, told the children that in
the thirty-three years during which he
had abstained from tobacco, he had saved
by the means $8882 61. It would also be
interesting to know whether any bright
boy in the room asked him if lie bad all
that money in the bant. Itisone of the
curious things about economies of that
sort that they never seem to make any
difference with one's budget at the end of
the year. Theoretic-ally, arithmetically,
they must, of course, but practically they
don't. What lots of thrifty, saving, get
aliead fellows there are who smoke, and
what lots of total abstainers from tobacco*
who can't lay up a cent to save their lives!
It realiy seem 3 cs if the matter of saving
money were presided over by nnseen imps,
who spirit away dimes and dollars from
some people by night and put them in
the pockets of other people. Cash ac
counts don't altogether explain the mys
tery. A man who doesn't use tobacco may
often wonder where he would get the
money to buy it if he did use it ; but if he
did use it, probably his accoodts would
somehow come U> ihe same thing. â Boston

We know it must be lots of fun to shoot

even if the ground is not frozen. Ever so
many of you are the proud possessors of
lovely coasters, and there are such splen

Winter Fon on Skees
not many boys and girls in ]
ibp \if.i went skeeing. But it is safe
to iay uiat there are few who have not
made snowsnoes out of two barrel-staves
by fastening a strap over tne center of
each for a foothold, and then, with pole
in hand, went sipping and sliding over
the icy streets or down the incline from a
snow heap.
Skees are worn like oarrel-stave snow
shoes, only they are much longer, straight
and spriney, and when properly used will
carry the heaviest man over drifts of snow
many feet deep. They are usually made
cf straieht-grained- pine or ash and are
from twelve to twenty feet lone, a liule i
wider than a man's foot and only a frac-

tion of an inch thick. The forward end
curls up lite a sled runner and the strap
for the foot is near tbe center. In walk
:n^ the "i-kee-runner," as he is called,
:a-st pushes one skee forward aver the
snow and then the other, without lifting
his feet.
In Norway and Sweden, where the win
ters are long, cold and blustery and the
snow often hides the fences, every boy
and girl knows how to skee. Indeed,
most of the boys can make their own
skees, ana there is as much fun in "run
nine;" on them as the young folk of Chi
cago find in sliding down hill. Once
ni anted on his skees the Norweeian hoy
dans down the steepest, mountain side
with incredible swiftness over the snow.
Hunters often run on skees when after
game. In America the home of the skee
is in Northern Wisconsin, Minnesota and
Michigan, wnere a great many Norwe
gians and Swedes are settled.
Here the boys ofien shoulder their skees
and so out to ths hillside. Then the best
"runner" in the party straps on his skees
and makes a tracfc down the smooth snow
to the valley. He is not afraid to attempt
the steepest descent, for he balances him
self perfectly with a short pole, and the
fine snow shoots out behind him in a
cioud. When the track is made the other
boys sl'de down one by one. Sometimes
i poor "runner" stumbles and goes over
head first into the snowy Of course, the
skees are strapped to his feet, and it
sometimes happens that he cannot get
out without the help of his companions.
When the sfcee-runner becomes very ex
pert he tries jumping. This is a highly
exciting and perilous sport. At the bot
tom of the hill a huge pile of snow, some
times built up on a foundation of boards,
is heaped up and the skeetrack is made to
ran to its crest. Then the dann? runner
starts at the top of the hill. Down he
comes, with the wind biting bis face and
the cay-colored flannel hood and scarf
beating out behind. As he approaches the
bummock of snow he stoops, sets his
teeth, and the muscles of his legs grow as
rigid as steel rods. Then tie shoots off the
crest into the air, and the spectators hold
their breath for fear he may not hold
rigid the long shafts of wood fastened to
his feet. And well for him if he lands
right end up and goes spinning onward
again.
For very expert runners the hummocks
are made as high as an ordinary one

runner to shoot from 70 10 100 feet
through ihe air before striking ground

problem that troubled the old woman who

the snow is deep and ttie weather is freez
ing cold sac weurs huge boots of fur
whicD come almost to her hips. When
she goes into the ijiloo, or snowhouse, she
pulis them off, and, picking up the little
hell of fur which unrolled reveals a fat
Eskimo baby, she drops the little imp into
one of the boots. If there are two Dabies
both boots are filled, and if there are three
she can well sympathize with the old
woman who had so many children she
didn't know what to do.
And so it happens that many an
Eskimo child spends the early part of
his life in a boot. At about 1 month old
be has the first real clothes of his ownâ a
wee jacket and trousers made of the soft
skin of the fawn. Then he rolls about on
the bed ot ice inside tbe igloo and plays
with the puppies, which have been
brought in from the cold, harnessed up
with strings and fastened to the side of
the bouse. When the little fellow's
mother goes out of doors she places him
in the huge fur hood which hangs from
the back of her neck and he nestles down
close to her to Keep warm. He is a good
natured baby, and it takes a very Ditter
wind st r aight from the north role to make
him cry. As soon as he is old enough to
talk he begins, like other children of other
land?, to beg for caudy. But his candy is
very different froui the sugar bonbons of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 31, 1897.
DITED DV*-
To him notbing is nicer and sweeter than
a new tallow candle or strip of fat cat from
a wahus. Sometimes if his mother wants
10 give him a real Christmas surprise she
makes a special kind of canay.
The big boys go out lor her and steal
along the snow hummocks until they see
a spot of deep red somewhere on tbe edge
of an icefloe. They know that this is the
feet of a number of queer little ducks with
bodies so white that it is often hanl to see
l them again>t the ice. Cautiously they
I creep up and capture as many of the ducks
as they can and carry them home. Then
Mr 3. Eskimo cuts off the bright red
feet and carefully pulls out the bones,
leaving only the skin. This she blows up
until each of the toes is as big as two, and
when the skin freezes in this shape she
] pours it full of melted grease. And this
; is a candy foot.
The little Eskimo has a pretty good
time, in spite of the fact that ne lives in
so cold a country. As soon as his arms
are strong enough he is given a little bow,
made of whalebone, and Â»:n arrow tipped
with a pin. His mother hangs a big piece
of fat meat to the wall opposite and he
shoots away at the mark. If he hits it he
may have it to eat as a reward. He also
keeps bis eve on the dogs, which are al
ways trying to crowd into the doorway of
the ice hut to steal some meat. If they
become too venturesome he pecks away at
them with blunt-headed arrows that make
their noses smart.
Until they are nine or ten year s old
the little girls and the little boys are
clothed alike, and they enjoy about the
same sport*. The Little girls have dolls 10
play with. They are made of walrus ivory
or bone, and clothed in fur to look much

like a boy. The face is carved with eyes,
nose and mouth, and the doll is often so
ferocious-looking that it would frighten
almost any little girl who Jives in Cali
fornia.
When the boys are about twelve years
old they begin to learn the duties of a
man. They go out and help drive the
dogs take lessons, in handling a harpoon
and in building igloos. Sometimes they are
intrusted witu the feeding of the dogs,
and it isn't an easy tasfc. For the dog
teams are given food only once in two
days, and often they become very hungry
and almost ferocious. While two or three
boys are cutting up the meat others stand
with long whips and keep the dogs at bay.
When everything is ready there is a ruÂ«h
and a scramble and tne dogs share the
meat. Often the weaker and smaller dogs
have to be taken insiae the igloo to be fed,
| so that the big dogs will not steal every
â  thins away frcm them.
Eskimo boys and girls have many
amusements, but they are so very simple
that an American boy or girl wouldn't
find any fun in them at all. One of these
consists in throwing up a bone with
many holes in it and catching it on the
point of another bone. They also delight
in turning somersaults. They place their
heads between their Knees, clasp their legs
and roll down a hill. As they spin along
they look like big balls of fur. If they
happen to hit against a piece of ice up
they jump and run rfbout their play as if
nothing had happened. For they can
stand a bruise without whimpering

man in hunting the walrus and harpoon

married.
the Memory of Home.
In a recent sermon Rev. M : not T. Savace
said: "No boy, no girl, can ever come to
be utterly bad who remembers only love
and tenderness and unselfishness and
sweetness as associated with father and
mother in tbe old-time home. Give them
manly and womanly example, give them
training, give them tbe inspiration of de
voted livesâ give them these higher, deeper
things. Danot care so much as to whether
3%0u are accumulating money so that you
can leave them a fortune. I really believe
the chances are against that being a bless
ing for a boy. But leave them an ac
cumulated fortune of memories and
inspirations and examples and hopes, so
that they are rich in brain and heart and
*oul and service. Then, if you happen to
leave them a fortune besidesâ if they have
ail these â the fortune will be shorn of its
possibilities of evil and will become an
instrument of higher and nobler good."
Jesus` Playmates
and the Spayyows
I like that old, old legend,
Not found in Holy Writ,
And wish that John or Matthew
Had made Bible out of it.
How the little Jewish children,
Upon a summer day,
W> <v down across the meadows
With the child Christ to play.
And in the <?old-green valley,
Where low the reedgrass lay,
They made them mock mud sparrows
Out of the meadow clay.
So when they were fashioned,
And ranged in rows about,
"Now," ' said the little Jesus,
"We'll let the birds fly out."
Then all the happy children
Did call and coax aiid cry,
Each to his own mud sparrow,
'"Fly as I bid you! fly."
But earthen were the sparrows,
And earth they did remain,
Except the one bird only
The little Christ had made.
Softly he leaned and whispered,
"Fly up to heaven, fly"â
And swift his little sparrow
Went soaring to the sky.
And silent all the children
Stood awestruck, looting on,
Till deep into the heavens
Tae bird of earth had gone.
I like to think for playmate
WV have the Lord-Christ still
And that above our weakness
Ho works his mighty will;
That all our little playthings
Of earthen hopes and joys
Snail be by li is commandment
Changed into heavenly toys.
Our souls are like the sparrows'â
Imprisoned in the clay ;
Bless him who came Ie wive them wings
To soar to heaven's britrht day.
â Bedford's Annual.
A New Kind of Kite.
Kiies used to be considered toys for
boy?. Now they are u*d for weather ob
servations and for decorations during a
parade or outdoor demonstrations, hav
ing held flags in the air at varying
height". Now the possibility of using
them in times of war to study the
enemies' fortifications is being talked
abont. In New York harbor is an island
called Governors Island, used by the
Government for purposes of defence. On
this island is a fort equiuped with
mounted gnns. Soldiers are stationed
there. Opposite on the other shores are
other forts equipped with mounted guns
and soldiers. No enemies' ships could
come to New York without passing these
forts. The guns at the forts woula sweep
the decks of the ships and sink the ships.
This is what is meant by the delense of
the harbor. One of the officers on this
island has b 'en experimenting in making a
kite that will carry a man high in the air,
where he may see the surrounding country.
He made a frame thirty feet long and
nine inches deep. This frame is strongly
braced on the inside, Â«d the kitestring is
a quarter-rope. There are really two
kites, one smaller than the other, fastened
400 feet apart on the kitestring. Tae kites
have no tails. The ends of the frame are
covered at either end with canvas, and
the wind has free play through the frame.
The kitestring fastened to the main frame
is wound round a windlass, and is paid
out by four men. LÂ«ss than that number
couid not hold the kites. The smaller
kite helps to raise the larger one. Last
week the kites floated in the air with a
dummy weighing forty pounds, dressed
as a man, fitting in a hanging seat below
the larger kite. The kites carried the
dummy easily, and when it was drawn in
it settled gently to the ground. The
problem is to nnd out how heavy a load
the kites will carry, and then to devise
some steering-gear by which the kites may
be controlled in the air. Lanterns were
tied on the kitestring tae other night and
made a very pretty sight.
Through the eSoris of the United States
Consul at Cologne, tourists will no longer

"The arithmetic teacher said for ns to

"Pooh ! That's easy 'nough," said stupid

Ills about live or six miles from the city of
Fresno. The country around is fertile enough
if it were no: for tne alkali, with which many
of the twenty-acre ranches are laden, and
nothing will grow on them except Bermuda
grass. The people around here raise all kinds
ofiruit. It is a great deal of trouble 10 take
care of a fruit ranch, becuu-e one has to do so
much work. First, the cutun? comes; then
the men put the fruit in a sulphur box, where
they leave it for a long time. It is then taken
out and put in the sun to dry ; after this it is
put into sweat boxes, to be taken East, where it
sells for 4 or 5 cents a pound. Just as soon
i as the fruit is gone the picking of grapes be
i gins. Ja^anes3 and Chinese usually do this,
! and It must be very hard as well as hot work.
They jut the grapes on the traya and there
they are left to be dried, and then turned and
dried on the other side. After this is done
j tney are put in the sweat boxes and are taken
'; either to Fresno or Kaston to be packed by the
! many young ladies. Well, lam telling you so
j much about this that you will get tired of it,

! is getting dry, like some lectures.

Scorching On a Bicycle Under FUll Sail.
Largest Bike ir\ the World, P'idder\ by Se^erx Crack Riders, Fitted Out With Large
Sails, Will Gut the Mile Record DoWr\ to Less Jkar\ a JMir\ute
T7-SESS than a minute to a mile.
\^% Two large sails have just been
J?H* rigged on a bicycle driven by seven
crack riders and they will shortly attempt
to cover a mile in less than six-ty seconds.
The big machine with its spread of canvas
presents a strange spectacle.
Frank J. Marion of S. racuse, N. V., who
got up the world-famed race between the
Empire State Express and a septupiet, in
which the bicycle came off victor, designed
the last cycling sensation.
The idea of a machine which could carry
a spread of canvas and seven men is abso
lutely unique.
In ca-ting about for some means by
which the riders of this the largest practi
cal machine ever constructed could receive
additional aid in their record-breaking at
tempt, Mr. Marion one day conceived the
idea of adding sail power to the machine,
The subject of adding two big sails to
the machine was suggested to H. E. Mas
lin, who is himself an enthusiast upon the
subject of record-breaking by quintet,
sextet and septupiet riders, and after
some di-cussion and of the matter
it wa- dec dcii to rig the huee machine
with sails and see what would result when
â with seven strong-lmibeu riders and two
c awinn sails it should be set going
against time.
The idea was a decidedly novel one, for,
while sail- on single bi:ycles had pre
viously been tried with more or less suc
cess, the idea of actually rigging a
seven-rider machine with a complete suit
of sails, which should be controlled by the
riders, was something decidedly new in
the history of cycling.
This septuplet is an exact counterpart
of the sextet which raced the Empire
State express, with the single exception
that whereas the sextet carried six riders,
tue septuplet, as its name implies, has
seven.
It has never been shown in thi3 country,
tut was sent as soon as it was constructed
to Paris, where it remained for two
months, after which it was shown by its
riders in a number of cities of Europe. It
was then taken to London, where it was a
constant source of wonder and comment
to the English riders.
The machine has just been returned to
this country, and immediately on its ar
rival here Severn Dorion, a well-known
designer of small sailboats, was consulted,
and after consideration of the plan said
that he saw no reason why a suit of sails
shouid not work as well on a big machine
as upon a sailboat or ineooat.
He was accordingly given the order to
make a proper suit of sails for the ma
chine, and these have just been fitted on to
the light spars which carry them.
The masts are of wood, light but very
strong. Tue forward one is fitted or
stepped into a metai holder or socket,
which rises from the framework of the
machine just bacK of the seat of the first
rider, while the second mast is placed be
tween the sixth and last rider.
CURIOUS CAR BUILT ESPECIALLY FOR SAURIANS,
The forward mast is about twelve feet in
length while the second or rear stick is
some two feet shorter. The rig is almost
a canoe rig. The sails are somewhat tri
angular in sr.ape and when set are kept in
position dv numerous small gaffs which
are in the namre of small booms running
from the mast through tuo sails to their
outer edge.-.
The sails are controlled by the second
and seventh riders by means of a system
of cords and pulleys in the same manner
as the sails of a canoe are governed.
The lower booms are on a level with the
seats of the riders, but inasmuch as there
is very little tacking done when the ma
chine is under sail, so to speak, this is not
so great a disadvantage as it ai lit st ap
pears.
When, however, it is necessary to come
about or set the sails on the other side of
the macnine, the booms can be raised by
a cord and pulley, so as to clear the heads
of the riders and allow the sals to swing
across c'ear.
The upper gaff of the front or larger sail
extend- several feet above tue top of the
mast, while tiie boom projects outward
about twelve feet from the machine.
This gives a sail area of approximately
r_'ti square feet, while the second or rear
sail hag an area of about So >quare feet,
thus giving a combined sail area of some
thing over 3*' square feet.
In the preliminary trials which have
thus far been made with this machine it
ha- been demonstrated that wuue the jails
are under certain conditions of the wind
of very material assistance to the riders in
the matter of speed, tney ca,nnot be used
to advantage with any breeze w..ich may
blow.
Under certain conditions of wind the
big sail area t.olds the wind and on sev
eral occasions the seven riders have had
to do some sudden and wonder. ul gym
nastic performances in order to avoid a
nasty spill.
When, however, the wind is fair the
sails cam* the machine along at a rate
which equals that ol a railway train and
in fact exceeds the speed of many local
trains.
The big machine with its sails and its
crew of athletic riders is now all ready for
the race against the record, when it is
confidently expected that present records
j will be practically annihilated and a won
derful new world's record for one mile es
tablished.
T c weather is thus far to blame for the
postponement of this interesting event.
The ground having been frozen has re
mained in a rou^h and unsatisfactory con
dition and t^ecrew of the septuplet are
hardly to blame for not caring to risk cer
tainly their limbs and possibly iheir lives
in a winter attempt to break the record.
It has been demonstrated, however, by
I the preliminary trials that better results
are obtained from the machine when it is
ridden across the wind than under any
other conditions, and Mr. Maslin, who is
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 31, 1897.
greatiy intereslei in the performance of
this machine, has just completed arrange
ments for the attempt to smash the record
as saon as the weather peimits.
The tests which have already been made
have taken place on the lakeside boule
vard, a tine stretch of road running out of
Syracuse, and those interested in the big
machine and its work are well satisfied
wiih the showin s thus far made, and are
confident that when forced along under
the impulse of a favoring breeze and the
fourteen muscular legs of its riders the
machine will cover a mile in less than a
minute.
Its riding crew is composed of seven of j
the best-known rider* of the country. The ,
steersman, William BÂ«x, has already bad j
considerable experience with the machine
before the masts and sails were put in
position. He has guided t; c machine ;
over a circular mile track in 1 minute and j
39 seconds, taking the machine and crew
across the finish line and to a stop in
safety.
Among the other riders of the crew of j
the machine are Robert F. Darline, the |
designer and builder of the septupiet; [

racing cyclists.
Several of these men were in the crew
which raced with the Empire State ex
press, and all of them have had long
experience in multicycle-riding.
In ih's corning trial of the septuplet
against time the machine will be Handled
in much the same manner as an iceboat
is, the sails being set as shown in the

Two Men in a Box.

Sixty-three hours a wee* in a box two
feet square â that is the karma of two
steady, Dard-working men in San Fran
cisco. The box stands u;>rifjht on the
southeast cornet of California ana Powell
streets. Possibly it is an incft or two
under or over two feet square, but at all
events it is not big enough to permit its
occupant the luxury of a comforable
yawn. The box has four glass windows.
On three sides of the box just below the
windows are bullseye signal lights, which
alternately flash from white to red end
vice versa. If a California-street cable-car
is coming up tie hill on its westward
journey, then the bullseye that faces Pow
ell street will flash a red light. If the
Powell-street car is nearing the top of
Nob Hill, northward bound, then the
lu'ht that faces California street will
gleam with a dark reddish hue. And it is

Rattlesnakes .May Become a Popular Dish
Frar\k Qoolsby Says the Meat Is Jender, Delicious, White and Pretty, and Only prejudice
Will Present j^attlers From Being Qeneraliy Eaten
|-^RANK A. GOOLSBY of Zellwood.
â IwSj Fla., has discovered that rattle
1^ snakes are a very tempting dish.
Every day he kills one, which is served
up later on the family table.
Mr. Goolsby is the first roan on record
who has made a meal off rattlesnake, and
he declares that the reptiles re, without
doubt, the most delicious food Known to
man. ' He has made a fair tett of tne dish,
having had them cooked in a dozen dif
ferent styles.
Mr. Gooisby is something of an epicure.
He has a little money and all the leisure
he desires, and so can devote considerable
time to the pursuit of new thing?, includ
ing those that are good to eat. And so it
comes about that, after running the
gamut of ordinary kinds of food he de
cided upon testing something novel, and
tried a rattlesnake.
According to what he says, it is only a
question of a short time before rattle
snakeâfried, stewed or curriedâ will be
come so fashionable a dish that no first
class dinner will be complete without it.
There is no doubt that there are dozens
of appetites ao jaded that they are will
ing to test anything new in the form of
lood, but in this instance the epicures will
have the advantage of having something
fu:ced upon them by fashion that is pal
atable, and will not have to through
their usual punishment when adopting a
new dish and in acquiring the taste.
OÂ£ course, there will be the usual cry
sixty-three honr3 each week to change
the color of these lights.
It isn't every man who could endure the
awful monotony ot a six hours' stretch as
a prisoner, day in anil day out, every al
ternate six hours, from one end ol the
long, long year to the other. Anil yet the
monotony of the job is not so great as
one may imagine, though there is, of
course, a good deal of sameness about ii.
But to the man inside the bux there is no
time for day dreaming and no time for a
comfortable yawn, even if there were room
enough in tne box to enjoy it. For this is
one of the most dangerous crossing* in
the City. Not only do two lines of cable
cars cr&ss each other here, but each line
has a double track, with cars moving at
all quarters of the compass at the same
time, and, most important consideration
of all, immediately to the east and south
of this crossing the grades are remarkably
steep, so that cars coming northward ana
westward do not bring the niotormen in
sight of the crossing until they have
reached the summit and are nearer the
danger point than even the conscience of
a street railroad corporation is willine to
permit them to be viitfaout intimation of
approaching or passing obstacles.
Now, in order to rill the position of sig
nal man at this point perfectly, the occu
pant of tha little box ought really to be
gifted with no less than four eyes, and
each eye should be so adjusted as to en
able the signal man to encompass with
his sight north, east, south and west, all
at the same time. This would prevent a
good deal of the head-turning and neck
twisting that is now nee ssary. But, upon
second thought, it would add greatly to
the monotony of the situation and rob the
occupant of the signal box of his only per
missible diversion.
The little signal box is quite comfortable
inside, all things considered, only there
isn't sufficient room in it for an open
grate anrt an easy chair, and the ventila
tion is not what it ought to be. It's ail
ventilation or no ventilation. When it's
all ventilationâ a good many days out of
the yearâ it means a draught and a cole!.
When it's no ventilationâ well, it's just
what those words imply.
After dark it is warm enough from the
waist up, for the lamps give plenty of heat
and to spare, and a blanket or two over
the feet enables one to preserve a normal
temperature when the fops roll in or the
wind blows down from the north. Still
there's that everlasting twisting and
craning of tne neck and the incessant en
deavor to loot four ways at one time that
seems very painful to the uninitiated.
"But I don't mind it so much as you
might think," says Timothy Cox, who is
one of the men who occupies this box.
"I've got rather used to it now and I rind
that \>y sitting in the corner of the box
with my back about half way between
east ami south I can cover the ground
pretty well without twisting. When I
lirst went into the box it used to bother
me a good deal, and at one time I was
afraid of cultivating a nervous habit of
neck craning even when off duty. But
I've got bravely over that. Though the
job doesn't pay so much it's a pood deal
better than a good many other jobs, and a
sinecure when compared with no job at
all."
Mr. Cox receives the munificent sum of
$too a year, payable in monthly install
ments, for his services as signal man. He
is employed by the Ferries and Cliff House
brancu of the Market-street Railway,
while the man who s ares the 18-hour
day with him s Sheldon A. Finney. And
his emoluments are no less nor greater
than those of his partner, though they
reach his hands through the coffers of the
California-street Railway. Both men look
a good deal alike, dress a good deal alike
and might easily be mistaken one for the
other even on a fine day. Their time of
service is divided into watches of six
hours' duration, that being about the
length of time that a good strong man is
enabled to stand the sameness of the aitu
tion as a regular occupation.
Of course, Christmas and holidays in
general â or in particular, eitherâ have no
place in the calendars that tell off the
livps of these two signal men, for street
cars, like mornin newspapers, are public
utilities, in the maintenance of which the
personal pleasures and conveniences of
the few are sacrificed to the needs and the
comforts of the many.

against the eating of snakes, but this will
give way to curiosity and desire, just as on
the outcry against frogs, and the fashion
able diner may look forward to a dish of
rattlesnakes as a certainty in the near
future. â¢
Mr. Goolsby, the rattlesnake pioneer,
was so delighted with the success of his
new dish that he persuaded his family to
taste it. Ha had not the slightest fear of
any iil results, and after the first shock
to their feelings was over, he declares that
every member of his family became so
fond of the delicacy that they preferred
it to any kind of meat he could buy.
As soon as it bee tme known that Goolsby
had been feeding bis family on thi3
strange food, his house was thronged with
visitors, all anxious to learn the details.
These were few ana easy to give. He
simply thought the dish might be good to
eat and tried it. His family followed suit,
and became so fond of the food that they
could eat nothing else for a time.

before using rattlesnakes as food, accord

course there would not be any danger of
death, for to result fatally the poison

Alligators That Travel in Palace Cars
JKeir Hostelry orv Wheels Is So Built as to /Wrr\it of VieWing
the Outside World.
iF^I/jN innovation in railway-car build
:XyL'^ in^r is the recent construction
JiVL' of a "Palace Alligator Car."
It is designed to rarry in safety and
comfort to any part of the world the hure
inhabitants of the swamps. This car was
built by a St. Louis car company for J. B.
Collon of Kansas City, Mo., who will
utilize his odd conveyance in a bu-iness
enterprise. Cars have been built for the
transportation of many varieties of queer
animals, but this is the first saurian one.
The term "palace" used in the title
might seem a misnomer, but when its
equipments are compared with the slimy
mud banks where the alligator makes his
home Mr. Colton may be pardone-d for in
cluding the word in the name of his novel
car.
In dimensions the car is about ths size
of the ordinary freightcar; about forty
two feet long, nine feet high and the
regulation width for running on broad
eauge tracks.
The frame is built of steel and seven
heavy steel stanchions hold the roof on
either side. Along the sides the upper
space is left open, so that the occupants
may be almost in the open air when trav
eling in their native climes or boarded up
when the colder latitudes are reached
during a journey. The lower half of the
side can also be removed, which is often
necessary, especially when driving the
long-jawed creatures into their queer
quarter*. At either end are steps precisely
likÂ© those of the ordinary passenger
coach. On top is a modern ventilator,
which performs its functions when the
sides of the car are closed in cold weather.
At one end are quarters for the attendants
or keepers with berths and other appoint
ments designed for comfort.
The interior presents the more interest
ing view. Kenning down one side of the
car is a iarge water-tank constructed of
cypress wood. This tank is three feet
wide and three feet deep, and extends
nearly the entire length of the interior 01
the car. The object of the designer in
placing the tank on the side was to give
the aquatic occupants an occasional op
portunity to view the outside world dur
ing their temporary captivity, as well as
ever so slight a degree would be undesir
able. Therefore Mr. Goolsby thinks it
weli to inipre-s upon those who intend to
test this latest delicacy that ihe most im
portant thing to be considered is the kill
ing of the -nake.
Mr. Goolsby advises the use of a shot
gun. The first reptile that he ate was
killed with a load of buckshot, the head
being blown entirely off the body some
four or five inches below the neck. But,
whether a shotgun or an ax is used, the
head should always be completely sev
ered and the killing accomplisned in the
quickest possible manner.
This latter result is accomplished by
vigorously thrashing the tail with a good
stout stick.
Once the snake is killed thn rest is easy.
The cooking is a matter of taste. The
snake should be cut up into small pieces,
carefully cleaned and skinned, and then
can be either fried, broiled, stewed, boiled
or fricaseed, according to desire. Mr.
Ooolsby thinks that the most delicate
flavor is secured by broiling.
The meat is as white as that of a spring
chicken and as tender as a frog's leg. The
flavor, he says, is so distinctly novel and
delicious as to be indescribable to one
who has never tasted it.
There is one great advantage derived
from this latest dish, and that is found in
the fact that the rattlesnake do^s not get
tough with age. Mr. Goolsby says that
he rinds no difference in the texture of the
flosb between young and old reptiles, each
being equally tender.
accommodate the curious public where
the car might stop.
In a far corner of the car, opposite the
keeper's quarters, is another tank for the
purpose of keeping live fish as food for
the alligators. It is almost twice the
height of the main tank, and solidly cov
ered, so that the travelers may not gorge
tnemselves between meals. This tank can
be reached through a window in that end
of the cur, as an attempt to go among
them with food would not be an alto
gether safe proceeding.
A stove is also one of the pieces of furni
ture in the car. This is necessary to pre
serve an even temperature while journey
ing through frigid climates, as the alliga
tor, being used to tropical or semi-tropical
suns, cares as little for the snow-clad
Is'orth us a walrus does for equatorial
waters.
The number of alligators which might!
be accommodated in the novel car de
pends of course, largely on the size of the
lizard-sbaped beast. Sometimes they
grow to a length of seventeen or eighteen
feet, and not many of that size could wad
dle about in the comparatively small
tank, but of the average size, eight or ten
feet long, Mr. Colton believes he could
crowd in as many as a dozen in a pinch.
The car has already made several success
ful trips with small cargoes of the queer
freignt consigned to circuses and aquari- j
urns and is at present traveling some
where in the South.
Many are the queer adventures of those
in charge of the unique caravan. The
accompanying illustration shows the alli
gator family enjoying the scenery while
the car is side-tracked at a small station,
wailing to be switched on to another train.
Mr. Colton, it is said, has found these
young alligators of which he has made
pels, and it is his delight during long stops
to take thorn out for a short fr. lie.
When this occurs the remaining cap
tives show their disapprobation of not
being tbe recipient of similar favors by
snapping their huge jaws and viciously
displaying their conical sharklike teeth.
Small boy 3on occasions find amusement
by poking the enraged alligators with
long sticks, but you may be sure the per
formance is done at a safe distance. The
After describing the manner In which
he killed his first snake, as told above,
Mr. Goolsby spoke on thn various points
in favor of cooking rattlesnake. "Be
sides being good to eat," he said, "if it is
fried one can use the oil for medicinal
purposes. What its peculiar properties are
Ido not know, but certain it is that rat
tlesnake oil is the finest thing yet discov
ered for rheumatism and stiff jo.nis. In
fact it is good for anything that may be
treated by a liniment."
Mr. Goolsby explained that after eating
tae meat what is left is collected and
stewed into oii, much in the same manner
that one would make beef tea.
'â¢Why," he said, "we would not think of
being without a jar of rattlesnake oil in
the house."
Perhaps the most attractive way to
serve thi* new dish is to boil tne snake
and cover it with parsley sauce. Mr.
Gooisby himself does not like the flavor of
parsley, so says he cannot judge of this;
but others declare that this is the oniy
way to bring out the full flavor of the
snake meat.
Mr. Goolsby Das replied to dozens of
letters of inquiry regarding the prepara
tion and cooidnz of rattlesnakes. These
have arrived from all parts ot the country,
especially from the big centers. There
are many inquiries by caterers and those
in charge of the culinary departments of
fashionable diu>i)g clubs, which fact indi
cates that beiore long rattlesnake soup
and rattlesnake a la Z.'ilwood will take
their places on the fashionable menu card.
enraged captives become so unruly that it
requires a vast amount of prodding with
pikes to subdue them, after which it is
necessary to shut them up in the car.
Variations ir\ Acorns.
It is said that in individual trees scarcely
two leaves can be found exactly alike.
What is true of leaves is true of seeds,
and, indeed, of every part of a tree. It is
also true of the behavior of trees during
their Jife career. In Â«corn 9 especially one
may note a remarkable difference in their
behavior. Some species of acorn will pre
serve thtir vital power without much
difficulty for a couple of years, while
others can rarely bp found with life after
a few months. Some, when put into the
eartn, will remain month 3 before sprout
ing, while others will sprout before they
are fairly out of their cups on the trees.
The acorns of the live oak of the South
often sprout before they fall. The process
of germinating is among the most remark
able of all American tree . The root
pushes out from the acorn 10 a distance of
many inches before it enters the ground,
the root then goes into the earth while the
bud or plumule ascend? to form tho in
cipient tree trunk. The young tree of tne
live oak will frequently be a distance of
six inches from the acorn. In this re
spect the behavior of this species of oak
corresponds nearly with what is almost
universal in monocotvledonous seeds.
Another early sprouter is the common
white oak. These have not been known
to sprout on the tree, but they scarcely
reach t c ground before the little radicle
prepares to enter the earth. It does not
wait to pet to the surface of the earth be
fore doing this. On shelves or boxes
where there is some number of them 10
--gether the whole will be a mass of roots
before a few weeks after gathering. On
the other hand the nut of the burr oak
will remain a long time before snowing
any disposition to sprr ut. It is these
varying characteristics which make rules
for the transportation of seeds difficult;
each kind has to have a method ol its
own. So far as tne two oaks are con
cerned, it has been found better to send
young plants long .distances than the
acorns themselves. â Mechlin's Monthly.

STAGE
De gustibus non est disputandum, which
means that you will have mistils if you
try to shape all taste 3 into the same
mold. 1 never knew such a varied assort
ment of tastes as weie expressed about
Modjeska last week. "Mci jeska is great,
just as brilliant and finished as she was in
the zenith of her hime," I heard one rirst
nighu-r remark, enthusiastically, and an
other biase critic chipped in with:
"Modjes-ka's acting reminds me of one of
those lovely frescoes t. at once stood out,
well defined and radiant, from the brush
of Leonardo da Vinci, or Luini, but that
are fading out with time and growing
colorless and shadowy," which was a very
different opinion from the enthusiastic
first-nighter's, and goes to show that de
gustibus, etc.
For myself, I would not venture upon
an opinion respectirg an actress unless I :
had really heard her, and from where I |
sat 1 could not hear more than half of
what Mod jeska said, even by remaining
on the gui vive and straining my ears.
The theater hat, whicb blots out the stage,
is trying to the nervous system of the
luckless wight who sits behind it, but |
catching a fragmentary dialogue is almost
as demoralizing to the nerves. Here,
again, the question of de gustibus comes
in. One woman, who baa heard Moti
j-ska many t;nics in her prime, assured
me, after the i erformance, that it was
quite a mistake to think the Palish actress
could nov speak as distinctly as she ever
did, and slu- backed up this statement by
sny;ng: "Her voice is not so strong:, but j
Modjeska has improved in her English.'' j
I suggested that had I furnished mvse'.f ]
roysell'with an aurophone instead of wi;h
opera-glasses I m ght have spoken with
more reliability on the subject, but my 1
friend scouted my suggestion and unfeel- i
ingly said, "You must be growing dea!." J

similarly afflicted.

as the subject for the piayvvr glit has been
bo thoroughly written and talied about
that contributions to the discussion are
no Jonger thankfully received. tecond
Mrs. Tanqucray?, Magdas et al., are mere
ly a question of de gu-uibus, etc.
In recalling the acin* in "Magda"
(apaitfrom tne star's impersonation) two
characters sta^d out as goo.i pieces 01
character drawing. Of course every one
â who saw the p!ay will say at once, the
stern old Major and the whole-hearted
unworldly Hector. Haworth had a most
exacting role as thr stern parent; resisting
all temptations to win cheap applause by
exaggerating Major Schubert's eccentrici
t es, he entered into tne complexities of
the man's character and never forgot that
Schubert was an officer and a gentleman,
though he was a perverse old fallow. There
was something absolutely hfeiike in his ef
forts to whis le the "Watch by the Rhine"
in a debonair manner when he had
murder in his heart. The broken melo !y
and the wuy he s-trayed from the key de
scribed in a more pathe'ic way than words
the proud spirit writuinj: in agony but try
ing to hide its inward preoccupation un
der a cheerful exterior.
I am proud of Lonercan's success, be
cause I predicted something of the sort
for him wuen he was playing incognito a
few week- (igo at the Grand. He to >k the
part of a soidier condemned to die at sun
ri c, and there was a harrowing scene of
suspense while the sun dallied on the
verge of the horizon. Lonergan was as
dashing and heruic then as he was sincere
and convincing last week in the finer and
more sub;le character of the rector. The
next thing we shall h<ar 13 that Daly or
one of the other great managers ha
claimed this young Californian for his
own.
Ov. the opening night of "Macda" some
of the members if t c ca-t showed a spirit
of independence in the in'erpretation of
their roies that was positively American.
This robbed the performance of the subtle
quai;y of homogeneonsness and truth to
local coloring, which, for want of a better
word, is .".ornetirnes called atmosphere.
As tiie week progressed the independent
ones improved won .erfully, each evi
dently striving to become a mere unit in
the success ot the whole play. The Chan
cellor threw aside his Monday night's
make-up and became a poiished man of
the world, whom it would have teen pos
sible for a fastidious woman liKe Magda
to have loved not wisely but too weli.
Little Marie tecame more German and
consequently le->s distinctively American,
and even Miss jf'oley, as the maiden aunt,
began to bethink herself that in German
un.itary circles there is nothing absr
luiely coruic about being an old maid.
The comedy element is not very predomi
nant in "Magda," and it wa~ the weakest
yart of the periorniauca, as far as acting
was concerned.
Talking of de gustibua, etc., il Antoin
ette Trebclli lias none on progressing as
she promised to do at the outset of her
career, hersi:!g;;i â  should appeal to every
one's tai'.e. 1 remember hearing her with
the late Sir diaries Hal.e's orchestra in
Liverpool soun after her English debut.
Tue orchestra used to hear so much talent
tha: it b'.cjm; blase, and I have seen ua
members listen 'o even ihe great Joachim
with appreciative interest but without
visible enthusiasm. When this young
girl mounted ihe platform very little was
expected frum her, as she was regarded
mere.y as the heiress to a great name.
Little Trebelli sang the "Shadow Dance"
from "Dinora," and a sight I had never
see:: at any of Halle's concerts followed.
The members of the orchestra almost to a
man dropped their instruments tne mo
ment the ;iria was concluded and applaud
ed her like schoolboys, smiling and nod
ding to one another as much 88 to say,
'There's coloratura sinaiuj; for you."
The blase first-nighter, the usher, the
doorkeeper, aiideveu the humble supe, are
all supposed to hold viewa worth chron
icling on the subject of a n -w play, but to
quote th;> tiieater scrurjlady as a dramatic
expert is in entirely new departure. Ed
ward Milton Royle has inaugurated t his
pleasingly democratic innovation. Having
tried "Capta:n Impudence" on the West
and found that the West .survived it, Royle
recently made up nis mind to gve it to
New York. While rehearsals were pro
gressing at the American Theater the
Bcrublady, in the pursuit of herdaiiy avo
cations, was jbserve^ to keep one eye on
business, and the other on art. The com
pany experienced great anxiety lest her
critical observation should lead her to
Dnmn win faint praise assent with civil leer,
Anil, wiihoui sneerlnp, tetch ihfi res. to -ineer.
This anxiety was forever removed when
j one day the scrublatly, to quote Rovle's
j aerent, "Put herself in favor of the play by
announcing to Selena Fetter Royle, 'Sure
mum, that's a beautiful play.' " So prreat
was the rejoicing at this favorable verdict
that Royle's agent rushed out, expended
! untold gold on postage stamps and
stationery, and, consulting a theatrical
guide,. mailed the scrublady's opinion to
i the dramatic editor of every big daily in !
Hie land. I am pleased to ob-erve from !
the newspapers that New York is indors
ing the scrub lady's verdict; it just shows
how women are coming to he front.

KEW YORK, N. V., Jan. SO.âThe tone of the
Â»eenrlty markets was the Inactivity In bonds.
The dealings la that department, reached the
enormous total for a half holiday of $2,261,000
and prices moved up anywhere from % to 2Va
per cent. The inability to lend money at anything
like paying rates accounts for the steady absorp
tion and advances in mortgages. The rise in bonds
led to extensive purchases fox both accounts, and
the railroad and miscellaneous list scored material
pains Long Island led thelist in point of advance,
rising 3<V2 to 5- on the announcement of the
sale of ' .he Corbin stock. Northern Pacific
preferred led in point, of activity, advancing to
15% for the common and to 383' 8 lor the Dre-
Jerrcd, and the grangers moved up to the b-st
figures of tie weeÂ».

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO. 111., Jan. 30.â After a week of un
interrupted bear success it was but natural that
: the wheat market should show some firmness
during the session on covering purchases a. one.
Liverpool cables offered encouragement to hold
ers, an advance of %@l% being reported at that
place. The bearish sentiment was still prevalent
early and soon afterward there wa* a downward
movement of 8,4 c. This was followed by a rally
which carried prices higher than they were ear
lier. Exports for the week (both coasts) were
light a 2.155,000 bushels.
Receipts in ihe Northwest were lUnt at 169 cars
against 176 last Saturday and 480 a- year Â»lo
Chicago receip.s were 41 cars and inspections out
were 41,381 bushels Closing continental cables
were higher. Atlantic seaboard clearances were

' CORN â a -hade better prices were quotable In
corn early la the session, but the weakness of
wheat after the first flf.een minutes had au ad-
Terse effect. Subsequently wuen the rally In Hie
leading market occurred there was apparent
strength In the tone of corn. Liverpool was up
VÂ±d. Receipts were 136 cars, and 22,190 bushels
were withdrawn from s ore. Exports for the week
amounted to 3.011,00i> bushels. The feeling was
finally weak on sales by early buyers, no support
being afforded prices. Export clearances at At
lantic ports were 403 940 bushels. May corn

UNION STOCKYARDS, Ilt,. Jan. 33 â Prices
of cattle are rather low in spite of the small
receipts. The foreign demand is good, but choice
export beeves are not coming here in large num
bers, the bulk of ihe offerings being half lat steers |
of medium quality. The ent.re week's receipts j
were only 41,700 bead and the January receipts
foot up lt>B, -43. as com par d with â -37.76.-i in
January. 1896. and 288,683 in January, 1892, a
time when there was an abundant supply :hroa h
cut the West, and yet with such meaner receipts
prices are low. Butchers' stuff and feeding cattle
are selling well, however, there being a g.lO : de
mand to snip to interior points.' The offerings o- |
day w-re light and the tone of the mar~e. st ady.
The total run of hogs for the wefk were 156.4 1 5
bead an I for January but 763,200 head, as com
pared withÃ7B.li*s in January, 1895; 1.068,260
in January, 1891, when sup;> tes were plen lful.
The ogs now being market d are choice and of
uniform quality, heavy weights'predominatin- 1 . I
and the range of pricei 13 narrowing. .\exi wee :
receipts are likely to be larger unless the weather j
turns severe a : . am. Prices were firm to 5c higher.
Both slieep and lambs are in active demand and
prices ore full â  as hlgn as a week; ago. Fed West
ern stock comprises the buik of the offerings, and
such flocks sell well, particularly cood, fat handy
weight Western sheep. The market to-day was
firm.

.WOOL- Jacob Wollnet'a circular says; â¢ Wo
have had quite a lively market the last ten days
and lots of Wools were -sold, mostly to scouring
mills, but prices ha y not improve-! much. When-
L ever a prico was asked a shade hlaber than prices
1 prevalent In December it 'whs refused, still there
have been about 2,000,000 lbs sold and stocks are
very much broken and the look is that when
the new clip Is ready to come in tuere will be very
little Wool in the market, with the exception of
j some very hlsh-priced scoured Wool in speculat
ors' hanus. Tue Eastern market in the last two
weeks shows unprecedented large sales, but at no
higher prices than were prevalent during Decem
â  berâ that Is Wools that were offered in December
at prices they could not reaizc were taken in the
pas: two weeks or so, and the market Is reported
act ye ami firm with no prospect of any higher ad
vance. Most of the Wool* were taken lor specula
: tive purposes. The mills still cannot get any
! orders for goods.' The London sales now lit pro
gress are active and firm, bu. with ve-.v little ad
vance and nearly 6n<~quarter of ths Wool offered
was :aken by American buyers, so we can expect
our markets will be flooded with lorelgn Wools be
fore we can have any tariff legislation, or if we
have, belore it can go into effect- The report of
tne Ways and Means Committee of Congress that.
| on grease Wool there would be oniy a duty of 60 is*
i lb is very discouraging, especially for our produc
i tion. The California Wool Association is working
1 hard and Is taking steps to bring before the Ways
an l Means Committee the necessity of having a
higher tariff on Wool. Our scouring-mills are busy
otiordtrs for Eastern account. The prospect is
that all tne Woo s now on hand will be used before
the new clip comes in. The market closes firm,
with sliarbtlv i 83 Inquiry." We quote Fall Wool:

There are certain plants which produce
flowers that make not only poisonous
honey, but also poisonous wax. Instances
often" occur of persons being ill after eat
ing honey, and the' case is sometimes at
tributed "to indigestion; but more fre
quently the cause is found in the honey
itself, the bees having fed upon some pois

SAN FRANCISCO OF TO-DAY
It Beats the World for Climate, Health,
Gheapness of LiVir\g, Schools
and Libraries
CffS^HE special advantages or diaadvan
\k\ v * a Â£ es attaching to any locality are
<j4^ generally supposed to be known
and understood by the inhabitants of the
locality, and yet no greater fallacy exists
than such belief. It is extremely doubtful
if one man out of a hundred could give
prompt and intelligent repiy to the query,
What advantages in life do you possess by
reason of your present residence?
How many of San Francisco's dwellers
are aware of the exceptional advantages
conferred upon them by their residence in
the City of the Golden Gate? How many
have compared the cost of living here with
the cost of living elsewhere? As a matter
of actual factâ not sentimental pride in a
renowned locality, but hard, positive facts,
proven by carefrl comparison â the San
Franciscan is surrounded by a larger ca
pacity to enjoy life, because of greater
ease in the attainment of its purposes,
than is his less favored fellow-citizen of
other great cities.
In no other city in the world can the |
necessities and luxuries of life be obtained
more cheaply than in ' San Francisco.
Rents are lower hero than in any of the
Eastern cities, and owing to the phe- i
nomenal character of the climate â its re
liable habit of evenness, not too hot nor ;
too cold, but "just right," the item of j
fuel is one ol the smallest which enter
into the consideration of the total cost of j
living. The conclusion that San Fran- j
Cisco is the best city for the economical
to dwell in is proven by a comparison of
ibe prices of the necessaries of life here
and elsewhere. The following table is
compiled from the retail market prices
published in the daily paper? of the cities
meniionedon Janury 15, 1897. From it
the reader may form a correct judgment |
as to the foundation upon which rests the
claim for San Francisco's superior advan
tages as a residence for the thrifty and
economical.

San Francisco, i
The differences in prices of the articles
quoted form a powerful argument in favor
of San Francisco. Not only is the ''poor"
man interested, so the man of moderate
means, and equally so the mau of large
means. All are seeking to obtain and en
joy the fullest possible pleasure of living
at the minimum cost.
â¢But not alone in the matter of physical
needs is San Francisco superior in ease of
attainment, but also in the possession of
all which ministers to the attainment of
the highest intellectual improvement and
consequent enjoyment of the esthetic she
stands pre-eminent. Her schools and
colleges challenge, without fear of con
tradiction by comparison, the ability to
confer upon the seeker after advanced
knowledge the fullest possible reward
which conies of enlightened investigation
under the highest advantages cognizant
to modern science. In the domain of
natural physics, covering all of its many
branches, the California University stands
supreme.
In every department of scientific re
search relating to the phenomena of ex
isting life, this grand institution has made
an enviable recorJ. In matters extrater
restrial, dealing with things affecting our
earth, but locate! beyond its narrow
boundaries, the magoiiicent astronomical
observatory on Molit Hamilton is the
finest In tne Nation. Equipped not only
with the best mechanical appliances and
instruments known to modern scientific
research, but also with a corps of skilled
observers of reputation for learning,
in its broadest sense of the present time,
it is universally recognized as of the very
highest. An Academy of Science graces
with fitting place the great city of modern
ideas. Not one of those time-worn and
dusty agcregations of obsolete learningâ
a museum of back datesâ but an up-to
date school, where the student of nature
may with profit and study
and investigate the marvelous forces and
powers of the world he lives in, and be led
to the formation of intelligent conceptions
that shall aid in the betterment of his ftsi
low-men.
A great library offers the priceless treas
ures of its shelves to the acquaintanceship
of all who desire to quench 'their thirst
after knowledge with grateful and re
freshing draughts. A splendid art school
reveals to the searcher alter the beautiful
unparalleled opportunity to acquire that
facility of fixing for the enjoyment of
others the grand conceptions of inspired
mind. The stability of all future greatness
is dependent upon the training of the
present child. San Francisco early recog
nized this important truth, and in her ad
mirable system of high standard public
schools is found the assurance of the per-
petuation of her marvelous growth in all
that marks progress and cultivation. And
each and all of these priceless possibilties
of improvement and enjoyment are the
property of the citizens of San Francisco.
There is no price attached to the acquire
ment of the privileges of employing to the
fullest extent uny of the exceptional ad
vantages I here otimmarize.
But, says the stranger, does not the pres
ence of all these public institutions entail
expense? And does not the citizen have
to contribute more largely to the generaj
fund for their existence? The best an
swer to such inquiry is found in the fact
that San Francisco has the smallest public
dabt of any city of her size, and her tax
rate is lower than any similar city ; not
withstanding she has line pubic build
ings, whose grandeu. and dimensions will
not suffer by comparison elsewhere. That
the true spirit of modern improvement is
understood and applied by her is evi
denced by her low death rate. The excep
tional salubrity of her climate, its bealing
qualities and marked uniformity have

long made her the "City of Refuge" for
tens of thousands of broken-down in
valids from the older Eastern and Mid
dle States, many of whom reach the Guld
en Gate in such enfeebled condition that
exhausted nature succumbs to the exhilar
ation of real life, the frayed thread of ex
istence b-ing unable to stand the vigorous
vibrations called into play in the pres
ence of pure air and absolutely healthful
surroundings. Were the deaths from
causes originating outside of the City to
be eliminated from the tables of mor
tality San Francisco's death rate would
stand lower than that of any other city
upon the globe.
So much for San Francisco as a dwell
ing place. What of her as a business city ?
Dunns: the year of our Lord 1896, just
past, California stands upon record as the
largest producer in the Union of gold,
wine, hone}', beet sugar, tigs, raisins,
orange*, lemons, oliveÂ«, walnuts and
almonds. Her wheat crop amounted to
nearly 29,000,000 bushels.
In n book published in London, England,
in 1876, entitled, "History and Descrip
tion of Modern Wines, 1 " the author, Mr.
Cyrus Redding (regarded in Europe as
competent authority), gives very full sta
tistics regarding the matters of which he
treats. He prints, among other lists, one
of the countries producing liquors and
wines, and the list contains but one men
tion of tne United State?, and that as the
producer of "Peach Brandy."
Since then, in two decades, what mar
velous growth has been attained in wine
production in California. The product of
the California vineyards for 1896 is esti
mated by very conservative authority to
exceed 20,000,000 gallons, in addition to
the production of 84,000,000 pounds of
!ai-<ins.
Is it good wir.e? Let those whose
peculiar educational training fits them to
be competent judges reply. One of the
be?t qualified judges of wines, and one
whose opinion is of world- wide recognition
and who is now with us engaged in an ex
haustive examination of our wines, says
unreservedly that "no liner wines are pro
duced than those of California." The
production of line wine requires certain
special conditions. For the "dry" wine
there must be valleys into which the sea
fogs and mists penetrate; for "sweet"
wines there is required inland regions, ap
proaching a degree of aridity. Moreover,
there is required a peculiar soil. Italy
and Southern France have long been
recognized as the natural growing grounds
of the wine grape. The special conditions
there found are the result of geologic
action â known as volcanic â marked by the
presence of soils due to the decomposition
of basalts and lavas extruded over the
face of the country during periods of vol
canic energy in tho past.
Precisely similar conditions of the
earth's surface are found in Western Cali
fornia. No region upon the face of the
globe exhibits more emphatic evidence of
volcanic ection than does the Pacific por
tion of California, and nowhere in the
United S'.ates can be grown with equal
success the true wine grape.
For every product of the State San Fran
cisco is the natural' market. Some small
proportion of the products find their way
to less favored regions of the interior of
the continent and d 0 not make their ap
pearance in San Franc'sco in actual pres
ence; but the transaction of their sale and
trans-fer is accomplished here; the business
of the transaction is conducted here. The
Board of Trade, the Merchants' Exchange,
the Produce Exchange and numerous
lesser institutions of a similar character
control and really handle the vast masses
of California's bountiful harvests. Other
lands than our own enjoy the fruits of
our production. Cnina, Japan, Australia
and India are eating our cereais, building
with our woods, luxuriating on our fruits.
jit is not essential In this latter day that
i man should contine his labors to the pro
duction of the necessaries of his immediate
surrounding?.
Man often makes use of a country with
out any reference to its agricultural
capacities. He seeks the minerals under
its soil; he turns clay into pottery; he
utilizes water-power for his factories; he
sects barren coasts for fishing â in other
words, he seeks his gain without reference
to climate or soil. Improved means of
transportation have increased his com
mand over nature. He is no longer held
to rivers and valleys as natural highways,
but can seek ana use the most direct and
speediest routes. The cheapness and
celerity and certainty of modern trans
portation give him command over the re
sources of the world. He is able to carry
on his work of production without regard
to individual food-production, and is thu.s
enabled to choose as his workshop and
i dwelling - place climates and locations
agreeable to his health and fancy. His
intellectual and emotional desires lead
him to seek Jarge cities, and this he is en
abled to do by the face that he can carry
on his occupation independent of his own
particular effort in the line of food-gather
inz." Still he is in a measure suoject to
his environments, dependent upon nature;
but the development of his powers has
rendered more elastic the cord which
must always bind him to nature's caprices.
i Here is the cord more flexible.
It has often been expressed by many
that the mantle of inspiration occasion
ally falls upon the shoulders of the
mortal and that there is given forth
to men a foreshadowing of the future.
In the early days when human longings
sought their fulfillment an unknown
prophet conferred upon our State it 3 sym
bolic title, "El Dorado." Every succeed
ing year from that day to the present has
but strengthened the belief in the
genuineness of the inspired exclamation
as applied to California. The mighty
city at the gate of the Orient has kepi
apacs with the sturdy development of the
happy title. Commerce, health, pleasant
living, literal ure, art, science, progress
ha,ve each and all maintained their steady
march to the creation of the ideal city.
Wealth has come, but without oppres
sion. Citizenship reigns supreme. The
foundations Jaid fifty years ago show the
wisdom of the builders, for upon their
broad ba^es has arisen a metropolis which
in its natural growth shall soon eclipse
the proudest city of the world.

FAINTED IN COURT.
Chita Jackson, Alias Emma (lcverlv,
Overcome by Judge Dunne's
Decision In Her Case.
Chita Jackson, alias Emma Cleverly,
fainted in Judge Dunne's courtroom yes
terday when the Judge decided that she
must go back to court and stand trial for
grand larceny.
Miss Cleverly or Jackson attracted con
siderable attention at the time of the
murder of Eugene Ware by declaring that
she saw 'a mysterious woman in blacfc"
leaving the premises soon after the crime
was committed. Her story was found to
be untrue. Subsequently she frequented
disreputable resorts and has been several
times arrested for petty crimes, but
hitherto has escaped punishment.
After her commitment in the Police
Court she applied to Judge Dunne for a
writ of habeas corpus on the ground that
she was illegally held to answer. His
Honor gpve the testimony a careful ex
j amination and concluded that no error
had been made in the court below. When
he announced this decision and ordered
the prisoner remanded to the custody of
t!ie Sheriff she shrieked dismally and Jell
in a faint. Bailiff Sullivan applied re
storatives, and as soon as the lady recov
ered her usual composure gallantly
escorted her to Her seat in the Black Maria.
BIG MONEY WANTED.
Butler, Bnek and Olilnudt Sued for
Nearly Half a Million Dollars.
John L. Haskell, as receiver of the prop
erty of the S. S. Construction Company,
has sued C. C. Butler, John A. Buck,
Nicholas Ohlandt and the S. S. Construc
tion Company to collect unpaid capital
stock of the S. S. Construction Company
as follows: From C.C.Butler, $250,000";
from John A. Buck, $125,000; lrom Nich
olas Ohlandl, $75,000.
The complaint sets forth that the plain
tiff is informed and believes and therefore
on information and belief alleges the fact
to be that all of the other owners and
holders of said subscribed capital stock are
wholly insolvent, which is considered suf
ficient reason for uot suing them.
The action herein is begun under and
by the written direction of Judge Heb
bard of the Superior Court.
