NEW ERA IS
DAWNING FOR
THE CUBANS.
Morgan's Resolution Recog
nizing Belligerency Passed
in the Senate.
SUBMISSION OF THE OPPOSING
FORCES-
Statesmen Who Boldly Declare That the United
States Should Send Warships to the
Harbor of Havana to Protect
Americans*
WASHINGTON, D. C. May 20.â "Mr.
President, I protest against being
mobbed. ' ?ho'ited Senator riawley in the
Senate at 5:30 o'clock to-day when the j
galleries broke out in acclamations over ,
the announcement that the Morgan Cv- i
ban belligerency resolution had passed by ]
a vote ot 41 to 14. This action was taken !
after five hours' debate, marked by pictur- j
esque and sensational features and sudden \
Â«nd dramatic weakening and submission of j
the forces opposed to the resolution. It was â 
the third vote that was taken, the others !
being a motion to refer to the Committee
on Foreign Relations which was defeated,
19 to 34, and on the motion to lay the
Fairbanks substitute on the table, which
was carried, 35 to 15.
The debate began more than an I our in
advance of the usual time, and was
opened by Thurston with a sympathetic
speech in support of the resolution. He
. read from papers a report of Sagasta's
epeecn in Madrid yesterday, declaring
that the Spaniards were not even masters
of the territory trodden by their soldiers
Ln Cuba and that the picture could not be I
gloomier. This was not, Thurston said,
the statement of a newspaper correspond
ent, but of a former Premier of Spain.
"If," he exclaimed dramatically, "there
iÂ« peace in Cuba, it is peace of devastated
fields, peace of razed homes, peace of as
saultec' women and peace of starving chil
dnn. No, Mr. President, there is war in
Cubaâ bloody, sanguinary, awfu! war.''
"Let us now," Thurston said in conclu- j
sion, ''dispatch the mightiest batile-ships '
in the United States to the harbor of |
Havana, where their frowninjr guns will
cheer the hope of those who struggle to be
free."
Thurston scoke an honr and a quarter,
but although his speech was flowery and
oratorical it did not seem to kindle any
enthusiasm. He was followed by Elkins,
who was occasionally goaded by wicked
reminders on the part of Chandler that
the Senator bad voted two or three times j
in the last Congress for a similar resolu
tion, but declared himself opposed to this
one because it meant the coercion of the
President.
Short speeches by Senators White and !
Hawley in favor of the reference of the |
resolution closed that phase of thejjque?- I
tion and a vote was taken which showed
that only nineteen Senators favored a ref- j
erenc?, while thirty-four were opposed.
The Vice-President was about to submit j
SENATOR MORGAN OF ALABAMA, Author of the Joint
Resolution Recognising the Eel igsrcncy cf the Cuban
Insurgents. Â»
The San Francisco Call
the question, "Shall the joint resolution
pass?" when Fairbanks of Indiana caused
surprise by offering an amendment to the
Morgan resolution. It was a declaration
oi sympathy with Cuba and an offer by
the United States to mediate to bring
about peace and Cuban independence, and
providing that the President should com
municate the facts to Congress with his
views. The amendment was generally
regarded as a direct statement oi the
President's policy and caused a sensation
in the Senate. The amendment was laid
on the table, 35 to 15.
White (D.) of California, a determined
opponent of the resolution, upheld the
proposition that the power to recogniz?
belligerency lies entirely with the execu
tive, and argued at length to show that
the passage of the belligerency resolution
would t>e entirely without legal force or
effect, although it might possibly give
moral support to the insurgent cause.
Gorman, in the course of his speech,
said that if it were true that the State
Department contained information whicn
convinced the Secretary of State and the
President that they could not with safety
give the names of American Consuls in
Cuba who had given such information,
the President was delinquent when he
fails to send a vessel of war to protect
them. He would vote for the resolution
in view of their failure to do their duty.
Chandler, who was in the chair, prompt
ly submitted the question, "Shall the joint
resolution pass?" and then when the re
sult was announced general and prolonged
applause in theealleries loilowed, provok
ing Hawley into his indignant protest
against the Senate being mobbed.
Appended is the detailed vote on the
passage of the Cuban resolution:

BEFORE THE HOUSE.
Passage of the Resolution Provid
ing for the Ralief of Ameri
cans In Cuba.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 20.â The
action of the House upon the Cuban mat
ter to-day was just what had been ex
pected. By superior parliamentary skill
Reed paved the Republican majority from
lacing a direct vote upon the Morgan
belligerency resolution.
Dalzsll reported from the Committee on
Rules as soon as Sampson had finished
with the journal an order for the consid
eration of the $50,000 relief resolution
passed by the Senate last Monday, not
exceeding two hours to be given for the
discussion.
Bailey was informed by the Speaker
that it he desired to get the views of the
minority before tne House he "must file
them with the clerk."
The most interesting pa-t of the day'Â«
proceedings occurred upon the disposition
of the report of the committee. Bailey and
Hitt making the principal speeches. The
debate upon the resolution proper was
tame almost to dullness, and it was passed
by a unanimous vote. The House ad
journed until Monday.
Representative Bell of Colorado during
the debate charged that the commercial
spirit and vested rights were at work in
the House to beat down the belligerent
rights of the Cubans.
Simpson (Pop.) of Kansas said that
charity should at least begin at home.
There were thousands of starving poor
at home, and these should ba tirst at
tended to.
FALSE REPORTS MADE.
Spaniards Declare That McKlnlay
Will Follow Crover's Course.
Cuban Victories.
HAVANA, Cuba (via Key West, Fla.),
May 19. â It i 3 semi-orncially declared here
that the American Minister to Madrid,
Taylor, has received a note from his Gov
ernment which he immediately reported
to Tetuan, giving the assurances of the
Government to Spain that McKinley and
Cabinet would not do anything mat will
in the least affect Spanish sovereignty in
Cuba.
The report adds that this declaration on
the part of tne United States made an ex-
cellent impression in Madrid and is of
much service to the Government of
Canovas in counteracting the attacks of
Liberals and Republicans, who are accus
ing the Cabinet of provoking an interna
tional conflict with America ny its sup
port of General Weyler's policy and
methods of warfare.
Among the Spanish officials in Havana
and in the Unconstitutional part, the re
port is received with great ]oy. The
newspapers of that party say that reports
from United States Consuls in Cuba and
the pro-Cuban agitation in Washington
have no importance, as the Spanish Gov
ernment positively knows that McKinley
will follow, with reeard to Spain, the same
policy that Cleveland pursued.
The Cuban element here believes the
whole matter to be a Spanish fake, aiming
to counterbalance the news of the strong
support given in Washington to Senator
Morgan's resolution.
In spite of the press censor's efforts the
news of the procaedings in the American
Senate is known to the public here. In a
lithograph which is secretly circulating
Morgan is represented as an American
soldier with sword in right hand fighting
against a large serpent bearing the head
of General Weyler.
General Queninten Banderns was in
Pinar del Rio province laÂ«t Sunday. He
and the Cuban leader, Muso Parra, en
tered the town of Los Palacios in that
province at the head of 800 men. The gar
rison surrendered without resistance.
Banderas gave orders to the troops to
olnnder all the stores in the town. They
captured many guns, much ammunition
and $15,000 in gold. After burning over
sixty houses, including the Government
anu municipal buildings, the troops de
parted.
A great scandal is the result of this
dasbing attack by Bauderas. General
Suarez Inclan, with a Spanish column of
2000 men, was near Los Palacios when he
received news that the place was in the
bands of insurgents. He gave orders to
advance at once against Banderas, but
his soldiers refused to obey him. Only
after strong efforts and threats was he
able to establish order and force the
column to advance. At 6 o'clock in the
evening he entered Los Palacios. Ban
deras left three hours earlier.
In an engagement at San Jose de Las
Lajas, Havana Province, the Spanish lost

Gomez has received letters from Span
iards in Madrid and Havana, who have
had propprties ruined by the war, in
which they declare they want peace, even
if a free republic is established in Cuba.
They want a government that will put an
end to the errors of the Spanish adminis
tration and guarantee the prosperity of
the country. Gomez authorizes this state
ment, though he reserves the names of
his correspondents.

CONCEIT OF A CONSUL.
Declares That If War Comes Spain,
Although Bankrupt, Can Fight
to a Finish.
BOSTON, Mass., May 20. â "Spain's
treasury is depleted, to be sure, but if war
with the United States must come, she
can fight to a finish," said Manuel Jarcie
y Cure, the local Spanish Consul, to a re
porter to-night when the action of the
Senate was told to him. "But the resolu
tion will not pass the House. I have too
much faith in Reed, and it Reed should
allow it to pass McKinley will veto it.
Belligerency will not help the Cuban?.
No one but the jingoes wants them recog

American gentlemen, have no use for the
Cubans."
VIEW OF THE CITY AND CASTLE OF AVLONA, Where Osman Pasha on Wednesday
Last Inflicted Such a Crushing Defeat on the Greek Expedition Sent to Take the
Turkish Forces in Epirus in the Rear.
Avlona lies near a small gulf of the same name on the Turkish side of the Adriatic Sea and nearly opposite Brindisi, Italy. It is about seventy miles by sea
north of Corfu and nearly a hundred miles northwest of Janma. It is the most 'important port on the Albanian coast and is visited regularly Dy steamers plying be
tween Trieste and Brindisi. It has a fine harbor, being well protected by Sasseno Island across the mouth of the gulf and the mountains which nenrly surround it,
and is strongly fortified. The little city ittelf Das a population of some 60C0, while the twenty-odd small towns and villages which lie within a radius of a Jew miles
have as many more.
The town is beautifully situated, and with its minarets, palaces and gardens presents a most pleasing appearance. It stands on and near the site of tha anc : ent
Aalon of the Greeks and Appolonia of the Romans, from which latter place Cresar started, after his defeat at Dyrrhacium (Durazzo), on his march up the valley of
the Aons (Vorusa) River and over Zygoa I'ass to Thessaiy and Pharsalia. This was doubtless the route which the Greeks expected to follow to attack the Turks at
Janma.
BORDA'S LIFE IN DANGER.

President Bordaof Uruguay. The first at
tempt was made by a boy, who tried to
shoot tbe President; the last by means of
a bomb, which was sent to the President
from La Plata, Argentine, and which he
received to-day. The bomb was in a box,
arranged so that it would explode when
opened. Fortunately suspicion was
aroused and the box turned uv rto tbe

Strange Notes Lett by a Bark Teller Who
Committed Suicide at St,
Louis.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., May 20.â George A.
Taylor, for thirteen years a bant teller of
this city, was found dead this morning at
the fashionable hotel Normandie. An
â¢â mpty bottle on the dresser was labeled
"hydrocyanic acid." His arras were
folded across bis breast, and underneath
the hands was a small silver picture frame
containing tbe photograph of a woman
for whom be died. Her identity is un
known. Folded directly under the pho
tograph was a note. There was no ad
dress, but the writing was that of a woman
and read:

nigger this evening? If so, write me
when and where. Yours in lova." Ko
signature.
Following this, however, on the same
note was this brief and mysterious note
in the handwriting of Taylor:
"May 19â Yes, want to see you to-night.
Meet me when I pass beyond this life.
Have never been myself since you died.
Lovingly yours."
Taylor's wife left him over a year ago,
and now lives at Eldoru, lowa.

NASHVILLE, Term.. May 20.â A statue
of the late Cornelius Vanderbilt, "the
commodore." was to-day unveiled on the
campus of Vanderbilt University, of which
institution he was the sounder. Ii is the
work of the Italian sculptor Moretti, and
is of heroic size. It shows the old river
captain in a ciiaracteristic easy attitude.

CONCLUDED.

Premier Ralli Says Greece Cannot Accept the
Indemnity Demanded by Turkey, Which
Is Out of Proportion to the Re
sources of the Country.
ATHENS, Greece, May 20.â 8 p. M.â
The armistice between Turkey and Greece
has been definitely concluded. It was
signed at Dhomoko. It was learned that
at first no date was fixed for its expira
tion, but afterward it was agreed it should
expire in seventeen days. Besides ar
ranging for a suspension of hostilities, it
provides for the fixing of a neutral zone.
â¢ Previous to the agreement for an armis
tice the Greek delegates appointed to ar
range for the cessation of hostilities met
the Tuikisu representative, Seyfoulah
Bey, formerly Turkish consul at Volo,
and, after a conference, the latter prom
ised to lay the Greek proposals before
Edhem Pasha immediately. This be did
with the result stated.
There has been some fighting on the
Epirus frontier since the armistice, but
accounts vary. It seems the Turks re
occupied Fort Skatiiaki and began to re
pair the works. The Greeks fired a shot
at the Turks in protest. The Ottoman
commander treated this as a breach of ihe
armistice and firing from both sides fol
lowed. The Greeks desisted on receiving
instructions from Athens.
Further advices concering the retreat of
the Greek army from Dhomoko say that
skirmishing between the rear Greek guard
and advancing Turks continued until 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon, many being
killed on both sides.
General Mavromichahs, despite a severe
wound, bore himself bravely. He carried
a pair of white gloves in his hand and
grasped his sword firmly as he rode along,
smiling and saluting as he passed, eiving
no sign of the pain he must have endured.
The Turkish army before Dhomoko
numbered 75,000 men andjfourteen batte
ries of artillery.
Premier Ralli In an interview to-day
said:
"The indemnity which Greece will pay
Turkey will be in proportion to the re
sources of Greece and her financial posi
tion. A cessation of territory is out of
the question. Greece cannot accept a
modification of the strategic frontier,
which would make easy raiding of Greek
territory by armed bands, and which
would compel Greece to maintain a nu
merous army in order to prevent such in
cursions."
LONDON, Eng., May 20.â The armistice
agreement stipulates that a mixed com

mission of officers of superior rank shall
establish a neutral zone between the two
armies, and that no advance on either
flank will be Dermitted.
It is understood that Turkey wants the
commission to be constituted of foreign
military attaches with the two armies.
Crown Prince Constantine, it is said,
sent a personal appeal to the Czar not to
allow the Greek army to be crushed by a
force four times greater than itself, and
that as a consequence the Ciar insisted on
an armistice.
ROME, Italy, May 20.â The correspond
ent of the Daily News says he learns upon
unquestionable authority that the pov/ers
have agreed upon their chief conditions
of peace, namely, an indemnity to the
amount of Â£5,000,000, guaranteed by con
trol of the Greek customs, and a rectifica
tion of the frontier, the details of which
have not yet been settled.
TURKS ARE GRUMBLING.
There Is Much Opposition to the
Dictation of the European
LONDON, Eng., May 20.â The Stand
ard's Constantinople correspondent states
that reports reached Yildiz Kiosk Wednes
day night that the troops in Thessaly and
Epirus are grumbling angrily because of
tne cessation of fighting. A military com
mission ordered the leading grumblers
sent to Constantinople under escort. The
dispatch a ids that the priests with the
army have been instructed to deliver spe
cial sermons on obedience.
The victories of the Turkish armies re
sulted in exciting scenes in Constanti
nople. Hostilities to European dictation
were advocated, and alienation from tbo
Government, which is denounced for
weakness respecting the settlement with
Greece.
The Sultan ordered that the patrols in
the city be increased on the pretext that
it was possible there would be an Ar
menian manifestation on the occasion of
the Armenian national anniversary, which
occurs three weeks hence. The real rea
son is his fear that there will be a Moslem
outburst against the Government. An
imperial order has been issued forbidding
the sale of drawings, photographs or
poetry dealing with the war or Turkish
commanders, evidently with the idea of2
preventing the heroizing of any of the
Turkish commanders.
It is expected that in the negotiations
for the establishment of peace Turkey will
deal directly with Greece and, in accord
ance with the precedent made at San
t-tefano, the treaty between Turkey and
Greece will be submitted to a conference
of the European powers, which will prob
ably be held at Paris.
RETREATED IN DISGUST.
Greek Soldiers Demoralized by the
Conduct of Constantlne at
Dhomoko.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 20.â ThÂ« Jour
nal's copyrighted special from Athens
says: "At 7 o'clock Monday evening I
stood on the heights of Dhomoko watching
the gradual subsiding of the battle. Eight
Christian villages, set on fire by the
Turks, burned in the plain below me.
This throws some light on the lamblike
way in which the Turks are supposed to
be making war. The right wing, driven in
to its second line of defense, was holding
its own, although no guns were sent to
assist it.
"Two regiments of Turkish sharpshoot
er?, who had shown such daredevil cour
age in attacking the Greek front, had
been checked. The battle, however, was
over. The Turks had shown great quali
ties as soldiers. They maneuvered their
guns with the greatest dispatch, and their
infantry advanced so rapidly the wonder
was where it came from. The Tnrks on
the right showed an utter disregard ior
danger and death. The Greeks had held
their own except on the right wing,
where mismanagement prevented suc
cess.
"Crown Prince Constantine viewed the
battle from a window of a house. I tried
to send a ilispatch, but the Prince, with
pule, drawn face, held the wire five hours,
versonailv communicating with Athens.
He is said to have wired to the K;n=r.
among other things: 'Army is lost.
Save u-.'
â¢Evidently be was badly frightened.
At midnight 1 was s eeping beside the
road when I was awakened by a friend (
who said: 'The Prince has just passed in a
carriage, with postilions, leading the re
treat as usual.' I could net believe it. I
found some iriends, Greek officers, who
said: 'We cannot look you in the face.
Greece is dishonored. We have been
ordered to retreat. 1
"Then followed one of the saddest events
in war. The Greek army, sullen and in
dignant, but without panic, left Dhomoko.
The men did not care to keep order. Cav
alry, infantry and artillery, mixed to
gether, plodded along the road to Lamia.
Thousands of peasants, refugees in ox
carts, on mules and afoot, carrying every
species of household furniture, mixed in
the retreat. The wounded, in springless
carts, were jolted over the road. Many
died on the way.
"At break of day I ran across the Prince
sleeping in his carriage drawn up by ihe
roadside. Thus was supervised the retreat
of the army. Exhausted soldiers gazed
stupidly at the sight and did not under
stand it. The soldiers were deserting in
laree numbers, saying, 'If we are not al-
Jovred to fight we will go home.' The
Greek army had become a headless rabble
and sick at heart."
DID NOT CONSENT.
Secretary Sherman's Reply to the
Notice of the Blockade of

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 20.âCon
gressman Barrows of Massachusetts has
the text of the letter written by Secretary
Bberman, March 28, to Pauncefote in re
piy to his note announcing the formal
blockade of Crete. Sherman says:
"As the United States is not signatory

amenable to engagements thereof, I con
fine myself to talcing note of the commu
nication, not conceding the right to make
such a blockade as that referred to in
your communication, and reserving con

United States."
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.
Alexander Vcn Hohenlohe, Son of the
Chancellor, Joins the Majority in
ihe Reichstag.
BERLIN, Germany, May 20.â A sensa
tion was caused here when it became
known that Alexander yon Hohenlohe,
son of the Imperial Chancellor, had to-day
voted in the Reichstag with the majority,
in favor of passing the third reading of
the Richter anti-Government bill, legal
izing the combination of political as
sociations.
The bill is the Reichstag's challenge to
the Government in answer to the bill now
before the lower house of the Prussian
Diet to amend the law relating to such
associations.
LONDON, Esq., May 20.â The Berlin
correspondent of the Daily News says,
commenting on the fact that Hobenlohe
to-day voted against the Government,
that his joining the Radicals and Social
ists is proof that the Chancellor is inimi
cal to the bill which is being considered
by the Diet, which measure hi allowed to
be introduced for mere tactical reasons.

GENERAL ASSEMBLY
OF PRESBYTERIANS
Three Thousand Per
sons Attend the
109 th Session. - .
Rev. Sheldon Jacivson Defeats
Dr. Minton for the
Rev. John L. Wlthrow's Interesting:
Discourse on "The Chlefest
, Grace of Christianity."
EAGLE LAKE, Ind., May 20.â Three
thousand persons were present at the
opening session of the one hundred and
ninth general assembly of the Presby
terian church to-day.
Interest in the session centered in the
selection of a moderator, there being sev
eral names under consideration. Rev.
Dr. Sheldon Jackson was chosen by a vote
of 313 over Rev. Dr. H. C. Minton of San
Francisco, who received 238 votes.
Rev. John L. Withrow, the retiring
moderator, delivered a most interesting
discourse on the subject, "The Chiefest
Grace of Christianity," and he took as
his text, "And above all things have fer
vent charily among yourselves" â I
Peter, iv:B
He first examined the nature of the
grace, sayinu that not a few confined the
idea of charity to almsgiving. Bat there
were more than alms di eds meant by the
Holy Spirit when he bade us "Above all
things have fervent charity among your
selves." The substantive term in the
original, translated charity in the text,
was one of two that stood for love In our
language. It was not love as defined in
Tucker's Philosophy, nor as described in
Tennyson'e graceful verse. It was not such
love as that the Holy Scripture extolled
and called upon us to have among our
selves. The line of definition must be
dropped many a fathom lower to touch the
bottom sense of this divinest term. And
when we did t*ke soundings in the depths
of Scripture what riches were found repos
ing in that one little word love. For it,
and it alone, of the words of the language
was ample enough to comprehend, com
plete and crown our conception of God.
for % 'Gcd is love."
Eliminate from the Gospel what it had
concerning the love of God, and nothing
left would serve a human heart more than
an empty cupboard would a hungry man.
To make the message of God's love im
pressively plain was the supreme respon
sibility of those who knew it, more than to
do anything else.
Here, then, was discovered the source
and spring of the charity wnich the text
demanded. It was the deepest pulse of
the life of the deity, whicn must be Kept
beating in every one who would hope to
pass the great crises which were yet to
come on Cnristians and the visible church.
It was but as we "loved one another" that
"Goa abidetb in us." Thus the question
of one's tolerance toward others of oppo
site opinion and practice of Christian
principles was made a criterion of Chris
tian character.
Ke next considered the greatness of the
need of this grace, and said its possession
alone proved one to b3 a member of the
Lord's body. Eloquence In Christian
profession did not prove the possession
of Christian principles. Though he should
subscribe his belief in every vowel, point,
paragraph and portion of (he Hebrew
Scriptures, and to every accent and af
firmation of the received New Testament,
and though he were ready to drive out of
the church or to put to death any who
would not agree to such an extreme doc
trine of inspiration, yet if his heart were
not gentle and tolerant and tenderly care
ful of the faith and feelings of oth
ers then he was nothing â of no
account, according to Paul's estimate of
what it took to make a Christian. Let
conscience do its perfect work and place
each where he belonged, whether inside
or outside the line of believers.

Hifllna Mailboxes.
CHICAGO, 111., May 20.â Adrian Brirt,
who at one time exercised a most im
portant influence in American history,
was to-day sentenced to two years in
the House of Correction. He was ar
rested on a charge of rifling mailboxes
and his light sentence is due to the fact
that he confessed his gnilt.
Twenty-ono years ago Britt was a news
paper editar in Florida and took a promi
nent part in politics. The Presidential
election of 1876 nad left matters in a very
uncertain condition, both parlies claim
ing the victory. The result depended on
Florida, South Carolina and Louisiana.
These States were absolutely necessary to
the Repnblicans if Hayes were to be the
President
It was at this moment that Briit got in
his work, and he is generally credited
with having so manipulated things in
Florida as to have the canvassing board of
the State declare the Republican Electors
chosen.
The canvassing boards of South Caro
lina and Louisiana took the same action
and Hayes was declared elected over Til
den by an electoral vote of ISS to 184, al
though the popular vote pave the Demo
cratic candidate a plurality of 250,000
votes.

VINCENNES,L\-D.,May2o.-At a Metho
dist meeting in this city last night oc
curred a very sad event. When the
preacher extended an invitation to those
who loved religion to come ud to the altar
and pray, quite a number accepted the in
vitation. Among others was Mrs. Nancy
E. Bmith. one of the well-known mem
bers of the church. She walked tip the
aisle with a firm step, and when she
reached the altar rail she knelt down
quietiy.
In a few minutes the lady who was
kneeling beside her felt the weight of Mrs.
Smith's body bearing againit her. She
moved a few inches, thinkinsr that Mr*.
Smith was crowded and needed more
room. She was about to say something
to Mrs. Smith, when the latter gave a
groan and fell extended at full length to
the floor.
Instantly there was great confusion in
the church. People crowded around t c
lady to see what the trouble was, and it
took some minutes before the sensible
ones were able to keep trie crowd back so
that tne unfortunate woman could get air.
A physician was summoned from near by,
but before he cou.d arrive Mrs. Smith
had breathed her last. She never recov
ered consciousness from the time she fell
over on the floor.
The doctor in attendance gave it as his
opinion that death was caused from Heart
failure. Tlie sudden death cast a gloom
over the meeting ana the community.

ALGER REPORTS
ON SAN PEDRO
Explains Why the Work
Has Not Yet Been
Advertised.
Gives a Statement of the Vast
Amount of Labor to Be
Performed.
The Whole Matter Referred Back
to Congress for Complete
Instructions.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 20.âSecre
tary of War Alger has made a response to
the Senate resolution calling for a state-'
inent as to what has been or is about to
be done with reference to making con
tracts for the improvement of San Pedro
harbor, California. The Secretary submits
the whole subject to Congress for further
instructions us to its purpose â whether to
create simply a harbor of refuge or one
for refuge ancfconimerce.
He cites the action of the Walker board
in deciding to expend a!l of the appropri
ation of $2,950,000 upon a breakwater and
says:
"The department has had many impa
tient inquiries as to when the work will
be advertised, and while there is no dispo
sition to retard the matter a day, the
difficulty presented is always the same,
i. c. : What was the intention of Coneress
when it made tliis appropriation for a
'Imrbor for commerce snil of refuge?
The report shows cle:irly that the entire
appropriation and more will be required
for the breakwater, and that to m iko a
arbor for commerce large additional
sums will be required, tbe exact amount
of which is largely conjecture on uccount
of there being the putsibility of rocs to
excavate instead of silt or sand. But tak
ing for granted that no rock exists, the
chief of Engineers has. by my direction
and from all the information there is in
the department, made two approximate
estimates for completing the harbor for
commerce according to tlie plans sug
gested by the board. It is believed by me
that a harbor covering 320 acres, or half a
mile by a mile in areaâ where ships can
be towed in, moored, towed from one dock
to another, winded or turned around,
etc. â would be the least that could be con
sidered.
"First estimate: Based on report of
board, deepening channel to inner harbor
to thirty feet, wiih width 400 feet, and
construction of two suitably designed tim
ber pier 9, located at a safe distance on
either side of the jetty entrance and car
ried out to the five-fathom curve to ac
commodate vessels whose draught would
prevent their entrance to the inner har
bor, to be used during completion of im
provements in inner harbor; dredging
from central channel to piers to thirty
feet depth; 14.0(0 feet of bulkhead for
wharfage, $2,479,000; cost of breakwater,
$2,901,788; totai, $"> .^0,787.
"This plan has the objectionable feature
of the destruction of the pile 3 by the
teredo unless creosoted, besides the dis
advantage of its great exposure to fire, as
in case of those wharves where steamers
are moored alongside aud engines run
upon them.
"The second plan is to dredge into the
lagoon and excavate a space of practically
320 acres, a half-mile by a mile in area,
and here the estimate is largely guess
work. Several islands will have to be re
moved, as shown by the maps, and it is
possible that there may be rocks to blast
nnd remove. But an estimate has been
made to give thirty feet of water for this
area where an average cut of twenty feet
will be required, and for this inner har
bor, with the dredging of the channel
into the same, the estimate is $2,175,000;
cost of breakwater, $2,901,787, making a
total cost for breakwater and inner har
bor of $5,176,787.
"The question is, shall the expenditure
of $2,900,000 be made for the breakwater or
harbor of reiuge, leaving the harbor for
commerce for future legislation and ap
propriation?
"From my construction of the law, I
have not felt justified in commencing the
work without fully understanding what
the intent ot Congress was when the law
was enacted. If it was and is its intent
that the work on the breakwater shall be
advertised and this appropriation ex
pended lor that alone, the matter shall re
ceive immediate attention. If not 1 hope
such instructions will be given as shall
leave no doubt as to what the duties of
the War Department are in the matter."

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 20.â There
promises to be a big sensation on account
of Secretary Alger's reply to the San Pe
dro resolution. Senator White construes
it to be a flat refusal to advertise far bids
for the work, because, as the Secretary al
leges, "the intent of Congress in making
the appropriation is not clear. Senator
White is "loaded" for the Secretary.
Michigan men, who are unfriendly to Al
ger, have written him and given him some
information that would cause a big sensa
tion if read in the Senate. -

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 20.âCali
fornians in Congress generally express the
belief that Alger has been persuaded to
delay the letting of the contracts by the
influence of Collis P. Huntington and as
sociates, who favored the seiection of
Santa Monica harbor for the improve

Tbese^lwo harbors have been conspicu

TORONTO, Oxtaeio, May 20â The big

The store was full of inflammable mate

tbe whole place was soon in a blaze. The
fire was so hot that buildings a consider

it was with difficulty that the fire was

THE SAT* FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 21, 1897.
DEATH A RESULT
OF IMAGINATION
Aged Santa Ana Woman
Expires While in a
Bathroom.
Leaves a Partly Empty Vial
Labeled "Corrosive Sub
limate."
Analysis of the Contents Falls to
Show the Presence of Any
Deadly Substance.
SANTA ANA, Cal., May 20.â A few
minutes before noon to-day E. L. Sher
man, returning from a drive with a friena,
was horrified to find the dead body of his
tister, Mrs. Ruth Cook, in the bathroom,
where she had locked herself with evident
suicidal intent. On the rail of tbe tub
was a bottle, partly empty, labeled "cor
rosive snblimate," and it was naturally
supposed thai the woman had taken some
of that deadly drug.
At the Coroner's inqnest this afternoon,
however, the astonishing fact was re
vealed after com Detent tests that the bot
tle contained neither corrosive sublimate
ncr strychnine; in fact, it could not be
determined that the liquid was of any
poisonous character, and the jury re
turned a verdict of "death from unknown
causes." The prevailing supposition now
is that the unfortunate woman, firmly be
hevine that the bottle contained corrosive
sublimate, drank of its contents and died
from sheer force of imagination.
Mrs. Cook's mind bad been unbalanced
for several years, and twice before she has
made attempts on her life. She was 71
years of age and was the widow of W. Z.
Cook, a noted local weather clert and
prophet, who died several years ago. Her
brother, Captain E. L. Sherman, has re
sided with her since her husband's death.
Mrs. Cook is a relative of John Sherman.

â¢IHRUVQH TKJON PAHU
Surveyor* Working for thÂ« Hanta T* or
Valltv Railroad.
LO3 ANGELES, Cal., May 20.â Word
comes from Tehachapi that two parties of
surveyors are at work in the Tehachapi
Mountains surveying a line of railroad
through Tejon pass, and considerable
speculation is being indulged in in conse
quence as to the identity of the railroad
company that is doing the work.
There is every indication that the sur
vey is being made by the Santa Fe roa 1,
for recent events in the affairs of that
company woulu seem to show that it in
tends to reach out for California traffic in
a manm-r that has not characters d the
history of its operations in the last several
years.
To reach BakersfiHd from Mojavethe
Santa Fp would have to build about
seventy mites of track, and a considerable
portion of it \vnild be very costly, but a
combination wi.n the Valley road would
simplify matters. Sante Fa officials here
say the surveying parties belong to the
Valley road.

PdIfAHÂ£XA'S ROA.HIHG ZIOJV.
Manehman Jiaten' l*e*peratÂ» Sight on
the Mountain* idr.
LOS ANGELES." Cal.. May 20.â Almost
within sight of Pasadena a ranchman
named C. B. Bates had a desperate fight
with a mountain lion yesterday, and
came out of the affray second best.
Though he escaped with his life, he has
some scars to show for his adventure.
Bates, whose home i 3 at Larnanda Park,
bad been in the mountains for a few
days hunting, and at daylight yesterday
morning he found the game for which he
was not prepared.
While proceeding alone down Millard
Canyon he left the regular trail to take a
shorter one, and, as he was in the act of
clambering over a pile of loose rock, his
blanket roll caught on trie limb of a tree,
causing him to lose his balance and fall.
Despite his efforts to save himself he
rolled down the steep slope about a hun
dred feet, bringing up in a cul de sac
thickly grown with underbrush.
The pocket in which he found himself
was difficult to emerge from, and before
he could begin to reascend he found him
self in the clutches of a large mountain
lion that instantly showed his haa temper.
Both man and beast were frightened,
and theriaht that ensued wai not so much
for conquest as for a chance to escape.
Bates had no weapons but his bands
and the stones that lay in reach, and with
these he combated the teeth and claws of
the brute.
As both combatants were anxious to
part company and the lion was better
able to escape he was the first to retreat.
It ail occurred in so brief a time
that Bates could almost imagine it
a dream were it not for tbe
teeth marks upon bis arms and the bruises
and cuts all over him. He fixed up bis
wounds as best he could Â»nd came to this
city to-day to receive surgical attention.
He declares the animal was six feet long.
Southern Pacific Boring for Oil.
LOS ANGELES, Cal, May 20.â The
Southern Pacific is following the example
set by the Santa Fe Railroad, and has be
gun boring for oil here to develop its own
supply of that fuel for engines.
The greed of speculators in putting up
the price of crudu petroleum to such a
figure that its use was not more economi
cal than coal burning, has driven both
railroad companies to do their bwn
developing.
ROBERT MILLS' ESTATE.
His Widow Appointed Administratrix by
the San Mateo Cour , but a Con
test /s Expected.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., May 20.âRob
ert Mills, who recently died at Belmont,
in this county, left an estate the value of
which is estimated all the way from $300,
--000 to $500,000.
This consists moitiy of real property
situated in San Mateo County and in the
City of Bun Francisco. Besides this there
are thousands of dollars represented by

ministration upon the estate, no will hav
ing been found, and letters were^granted
to her thin morning unon her giving a
bond in the sum of $125,000.

titioner knows, the heirs of deceased are
herself and two sistersâ Miss Ann Scho

ceased named Taylor, residing in Grafton
Pa.
I tie petitioner avers that she was mar
ried to Robert Mills in ban Jose in the
year 1891 and thÂ«t to tbe best of her
knowledge Mr. Mills had nevrr been mar
ried before, but notwithstanding this lact
it is pretty well known that there will be
a contest for part of his estate by those
who claim to be children of the deceased.
Deceased came to this countiy in early
days and soon after settled in this county ,
where he resided up to the time of his
death. He was at one time a manufacturer

ALVISO HARBOR
TO BE IMPROVED
Santa Clarans Urged to
Action by the Board
of Trade.
Us Commercial Importance Is
Shown by Prominent
Citizens.
Regardless of State or Federal Aid,
the Work Will Undoubtedly
Be Performed.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 20.â The Board of
Trade is working assiduously for the im
provement of Alviso harbor, and in the
next few months some definite action re
garding Santa Clara County's seaport will
be taken. For the past eieht years efforts
have been made to secure Government aid
to widen and deepen the channel, but now
it seems as though the hope of the Board
of Trade is about to be accomplished. The
business men of San Jose are taking an
active interest in the matter, and it is pro
posed to organize and appoint commit
tees to help the Board of Trade to carry
on the work.
At present the steamer A:viso makes
daily trips Between San Francisco and
half a dozen teams are engaged in hauling
freight between the port and this city. The
shipments at the rlace are steadily in
creasing and amount to tfcou.-ands of tons
annually. With the construction of a
railroad shipments will increase enor
mously, but it is necessary that the har
bor be improved in order to admit of deep
water vessels.
In an interview with Secretary J. P.
Fay of the Board of Trade regarding the
attitude of the board toward the Aiviso
Channel that gentleman said:
"This board is just as determined and
just as full of faith in the ultimate success
of its efforts for the improvement of this
waterway as at any time in the past eight
years, bo far as we know the sentiment
in this section is almost unanimous in fa
vor of an appropriation from either the
Government or Btate for this purpose,
and. in fact, every support wa* given to
Assemblyman Matt Arnerich of this
c mnty at the last legislative session in the
interest of his bill asking an appropriation
of $25,000 for needed improvements in
Aiviso Slongh.
"This bill, a? is a matter of history,
passed botn houses, only to meet its
deathblow at the hands of Governor
Budd. Many of us felt that there wss a
manifest inconsistency on the part of the
Governor in airising his signature to the
dredger appropriation bill calling for an
expenditure of $3u0,000 for the purpose of
dredging the Sacramento and San Joaqain
rivers and vetoing the Aiviso Channel ap
propriation biil. The Governor's action
destroyed cur last hope of relief from the
State, but rnir.y responsible taxpayers have
urged the propriety of the county under
taking the work of improving Aviso
Slougb. Shipment's to and from tbe port
have increased largely within the last two
year?, and when thÂ«Â» time arrives for per
m tting deep-draught vessels to make a
landing at this port witnout the possi
bility o! runnine aground business will
boom immensely.
"Congressman E. F. Loud, who suc
ceeded over a year ago in obtaining an
appropriation for a preliminary survey of
Aiviso Channel and ever since has cheer
fnlly co-operaJei with our board in its
efforts for relief for navigation upon this
waterway, has a??ured us tbat ne will re
new his efforts and will persist until con
vinced that further attempts are useless.
The board realizes that what couid be
done has been done by Congressman
Loud and has faith to believe that in
spite of all the obstacles now in thÂ» way
Aiviso Siongrs will yet be a navigable
stream at all times and tides.
"Navigators have been much benefited
by the beacon posts placed along: the ap
proach to Aiviso Slough and which were
secured by Congressman Loud upon peti
tion of this board. It is expected that an
appropriation for lights to be placed on
these posts will be obtained, and thus
another great advantage will have been
obtained. '*
Frank Stock, a prominent member of
the Board of Trade, in discussing the im
provement of Alviso harbor, said : "Alviso
is the county's only port, and should be
so improved as to become a great com
mercial outlet for San Joso and the
southern end of Santa Clara Valley. At
present it is inadequate, and merchant;
shipping by that route are often subject
to vexatious deiays. But this couid be
easily remedied by the Govern ment ex
rending from $40,000 to $00.000. While
Petaluma and Santa Rosa have received
appropriations for dredging their chan
nels, Alviso has been entirely oyerlooked.
As it is, tie waterway has been the means
of saving the merchants of San Jose
thousands of dollars in freight rates. The
railroad ha? been compelled Jo meet the
cat in rates made by the steamer, and this
has resulted in incalculable gooa. The
shipments by way of Alviso are con
stantly increasing, and the Government
cannot loneer ro^tpoie improving the
channel. Tne lumber shipments alone at
the rort amount to between 15.000,000 and
30,000,000 feet annually. Aid to this the
thousands of tons of produce and mer
chandise that are received and forwarded,
and some idea of the importance of the
place can be imagined.
"The Board of Trade and citizens gener
ally of San Jose should work together
with the ultimate view of securing the
needed improvements. Every one in the
valley will be benefited by the change and
there should be no laggards. Aid may
not be secured from Congress at this ses
sion, but we should have things in such
saape that when the proper time comes
a committee, backed by convincing stat
istics, could co right on to Washington
and present the matter to Congress. The
merchants are all for the improvement,
and by united effort we shall succeed."
Mr. Stock is an enthusiast on the sub
ject, and in proof of what can be done
points to wiiat progressiveness and enter
prise has done for Los Angeles.
Adolph Greeninger, ex-chairman of the
Board of Supervisors, believes that Alviso
Harbor should be improved at once. If
the National or State governments fail to
take hold of the matter he favors the
county taking hold of it and making the
J. tj prove men ts by direct taxation. Mr.
Greeninger wa? a member of the Board of
Supervisors for twelve years, has been
prominently connected with the Board of
Trade and is deeply interested in all mat
ters pertaining to the advancement of
Santa Clara County. In speaking of Al
viso Harbor to-day he said :
"It is essential to San Jose and the sur
rounding country that Alviso Channel be
improved, and it should betaken up at
once, ior several years we have been try
ing to secure appropriations from the
Government for that purpose, but each
time we have been confronted by the ad
verse report of the Government engineers.
This delay is vexatious, working great in
jury to this city, and if the Government
or State refuses to make the improvement
Santa Clara County should go ahead and
do the work.
"I am in favor of raising $40,000 by di
rect taxation to carry on the work. This
â would not be felt by the taxpayers and
wouid be sufficient to give San Jose a good
watercourse. A dredeer could be secured
and a fore of men put to work. In two
years' time we would be independent ot
the railroads an'l would have connection
by water with all coast towns.
"Besides, the money wouid be spent
among our own people, and the money
*.hus raised by taxation would now right
Kick into trade channels. The county is
amply able to go ahead with tna work.
Santa Clura County is better off finan
cially than any other county in the State.
Our indebtedness is only $112,000, and
this is on 4 and 4K per cent bonds. A few
years ago we buiu" the hat! of records at a
cost of $250,000 by direct taxation and the
people hardly felt the increase.
"It would be the same way with the im
provement of Alviso Channel. The ship
ping by that route for the past several
years has been sufficiently large to have
received recosnitiou at the hands of Con
gress. It looked as though we were to re
ceive an appropriation from the State this
spring but Governor Budd vetoed the
bill, although a bill appropriating $300,000
for similar improvement? in the Gan Joa
ouin and Sacramento rivers received his
indorsement. With the contemplated im
provements at Alvi?o, San JoÂ«e and en
virons we will receive more business from
the surrounding country, and prosperity
must necessarily follow."

ARIZONA TAX LEVY IGNORED.
Attorney-General Wilson Will Bring Suit
Against the Superv sors of Default
ing Counties.
PHCENIX, Ariz., May 20.â The last
Legislature oi Arizona made appropria
tions to the Territorial University and
Territorial Normal School in the shape
of an added Territorial tax levy that
would bring in about $"-'6,000 per annum
for two years. The funds were to be
used for the completion of the dormitory
at the university and for the completion
of the Normal building. The money for
the purpose was voted out of the Terri
tory's general fund, to be replaced by the
income from the extra tax. Now it is an
anounced from a half dozen oi the coun
ties that they wiU not respond to the
extra tax levy, the claim being made by
several county attorneys and by their
Boards of Supervisors that the levy is in
violation of the Harrison limitation act,
placing additional debt upon the counties
in exi-ess ot the 4 percent limit prescribed
by Congress. Gila County was the leader
in this, having Jailed to make levy for
simiiar taxes prescribed by the Legisla
ture of two years ago.
Attorney-General "Wilson was seen by
your correspondent to-day and interro
gated on the course the Territory should
take aiÂ»a::ist the rebellious counties. "I
propose to have nothing to do witn the
counties," he answered. "If the levy be
not made I snail at once commence suit
iv tne proper District Courts against the
Supervisors of the defaulting counties
; nd will sue them in the name of the
Territory on their bonds, under the charee
of misfeasance in office. If they choose
to defy a plain statute of the Legislature
they will be made to suffer personally
and financially for their assumption. It
is all rot to say that this tax levy increases
the debt of the Territory or of any county.
The Legi-lature has the fullest power to
make such a special tax; it adds to no
indebtedness and must be paid."
MORO BAY'S NEW ISLAND.
Thought to Be a Phenomenon, It Proves
to Be a Mud Bank Caused by
the Tides.
SAN* LUIS OBISPO, Cal., May 20.â
Considerable amusing comment has been
caused in this city during the past few
days over reports in circulation of the ex
istence of an island which suddenly ap
peared on the surface of Moro Bay, thir
teen miles distant from this city, one
morning when the people in that vicinity
awoke.
On investigation the so-called island
proved to be nothing more than a long
bank of mud and sand near the upper end
of the bay, and the only thing pnenome
nal about it was that at one end of the
bank was an elevation much higher than
at the lower end, and that one night the
bank shifted so that the elevation was at
the opposite end.
For some years past Moro Bay has been
rapidly filling up with sand and mud,
owing to the action of the tides, and the
surface of the water, which only a few
years ago was navigable for small craft, is
now so rilled that a sraall sailboat would
have some difficulty in sailing over cer
tain portions of it even during high tide.
There are a number of sandDars and
mud banks in the bay, but the present one
is the largest which has shown its head
above the surface of the water so far, and
the sudden shifting of the mud bank was
simply caused by the action of the tides
undermining the opposite ends, so the
people of Moro say, and they ought to
know.
There wa* no explosion nor seismic dis
turbance whatever. There are no geysers
in the bay, an i there is no eas of any kind
in existence in that portion of the county.
As for fishermen navigatine in the bay for
rish, they would have considerable diffi
bulty in mating a dally catch of even
flounders to -upply the market.
The people In that neighborhood have
not become frightened as yet, nor do they
fear any kind of explosion, and there is
only one mud or sand bank of any conse
quence which would attract notice and
that is the one mentioned above.

Serious Fire Has Occurred In the
Steamship Belerlc at Her Buoy
In Honpkong.
VANCOUVER, B. C, May 20.â Oriental
advices state that a serious fire occurred
four week* ago in No. 1 bold of the Occi
dental and Oriental steamer Belgic as she
was lying at her buoy in Hongkong. The
outbreak originated near an earthen fur
nace in the 'tween decks, which was be
ing used for the purpose of iumigating
the luggage of the Chinese passengers.
Hongkong's new floating lire engine was
sent to the vessel and a small party of
firemen from the Central Police Station,
but it was not until 1 o'clock in the morn
ing that they finished their work, which
consisted principally of pumping water
into the hold. The luggage of the Chinese
passengers and a quantity of matting
were destroyed and a somewiat serious
personal injury was recorded. One of the
boilers of the floating fire engine burst,
the consequence being that a Chinese fire
man was severely scalded about the body.
He was taken with all haste to the Gov
ernment Civil Hospital. The fire delayed
the Belgic two days in departing from
Hongkong.
Shanghai papers tell of famine in
the Chinese provinces of Szechuen and
Hupeh in alarming words. Authorities
are sending grain to destitute people, but
inland districts away from the rivera have
not been reached. Leading merchants in
Szechuen have appealed to foreigners for
help. From Chinese sources 11,000 taels
were quickly subscribed and telegraphed.
Foreign trading-houses have given liber
ally, and her Majesty the Dowager Em
press has sent 150.000 taels to suffering
districts. The famine has set many bands
of brigands to work. One band of a hun
dred has carried off a score of prisoners
and a large quantity of money and goods
from Taipah. The former are mostly
daughters of wealthy families. A promi
nent millionaire was robbed of two
daughters who are now held for ransom
at SO, 000 yen. Robbers have sent word
that uiness the sum is paid promptly the
heads of their victims will be returned
without their bodieÂ». In two instances
wealthy men have been carried off and
friends obliged to pay large sums for their
ransom.
Chinese pirates are actively at work
along the coast on the Yang-tsa River.
At Nanchang, three weeks ago. five mer

and foully murdered. They were mem
bers of a party of six, one of whom
escaped by diving overboard. From an
unsuspicious boat which came along-ide a
horde of pirates suddenly rose up from
concealment, boarded the merchants'
boat and overpowered the boatman. They
first robbcj the merchants and then
butchered them one after another.
CoJonel Tin High, a mandarin and com
mander of Sankong, was traveline on the
West .River with his family, concubines

SHOT HIMSELF AT NOG ALES.
Tragic End of a Mexican Custom- House
Guard Who Had a Record for
Bravery.
NOGALES, Ariz., May 20.â This morn
ing at 11 o'clock Juan de la Torre, a
custom-house guard in the employ of the
Mexican GoTernment here, committed
suicide by shooting himself through the
heart.
For the past two weeks De la Torre had
been acting very strangely, and had told
friends that other customs officials had
formed a conspiracy to poison him.
This morning he went to the Mexican
custom - house to secure the necessary
papers from the collector to allow the
southbound train to leave this station.
While at the custom-house he went to
the room where arms are kept, pro
cured a revolver and returning to
the depot after the train had
left he went to another guard
named Garcia, and frightened that indi
vidual by drawing the revolver and ex
claiming. "I'll not allow you the pleas
ure of poisoning me," ami placing the
gun to bis breast he pulled the trigger and
fell dead.
De la Torre had been employed by the
Mexican Government for many years, and
was well known for his bravery and effi
ciency in intercepting smugglers and con
traband goods.
He played quite a prominent part dur
ing the fight with the Yaqui Indians and
the citizens here last August, and two
Indians that were killed during the con
flict fell before the unerring aim of his
rifle.

BAKERSFIELD`S
DEEP MYSTERY
Miss Winslow Returns
Home in Hysterical
Condition.
Unable to Give an Account
of Her Strange Disap
pearance.
â^^^â^â â
Fears the Vengeance of Garner, the
Accused Counterfeiterâ Signs
of a Dark Plot.
BAKERSFIFLD,CAt.,Ma;.
Winslow, the United States Court witness
who so mysteriously disappeared from her
home in this city Tuesday evenine, turned
tip tnis evening about 5 o'clock. . On meet
ing her mother si c fell prostrated and ap
peared to be in great agony of mind. So
hysterical was she that it was some time
before she could even incoherently tell the
reason of her strange disappearance. She
said she had been at the home of J. W.
Garner, the accused counterfeiter, and
that was all sue would say.
Tnis story is not believed by her friends.
They claim that force was used to conceal !
the girl by those interested in Garner's '
behalf and that Miss Winslow is alraid to
tell the true story of it. She claims that
she has not eaten anything for two days,
ever since her disapoearance, and declares
that sne had rather die than to appear in
court at Los Auge.es.
Miss Winslow's father stated to-day
that Garner had written to a party here
that he would "wipe the Winslows off the
face of the earth if they test: fie J against
him."
The members of the Winslow family are
the strongest witnesses against Garner.
There is much excitement here over the
affair, and the opinion generally prevails
that an attempt has been made to get the
girl out of the way. This is the opinion
of the Sheriff's office also. Marshal Oats
arrived here this evening from Los An
geles with an attachment for the young
lady, but owing to her critical condition
she will not be able to go to Los Angeles
possibly uutil to-morrow.
The case was calied this mornins before
Judge Wellborn and had to go over for a
day on account of the absence of Miss
Winslow. Indications are that there will
be some sensational developments when
it conies to trial and it is more than likely
that other persona of some prominence
here will be implicated. When asked
about it Marsha! Oaks shook bis head
mysteriously and intimated that it would
be well to wait for developments. Every
body here is interested in the outcome of
the affair and the interest has increased
since the action of Miss Winslow.

In 1471 a French baron offered a pledge
of 10 marks of silver that a copy of Avi

was refused.
The "Book of Common Prayer' 1 was
prepared by the command of Henry VIII,
in 1646. It underwent several revisions,
but the second, made in the reign of
Edward VI, very nearly approaches the
prayer-book as used tc-iiay in the Church
of England. The prayer for the royal lam
ily was introduced by James I.
Most of the chapters of Livy, as well as
some of the entire compositions of Cicero
and other ancient authors have been re

in 1643 and sixty-one volumes have alto
gether been issued. Other volumes are
still in preparation.
The first ecclesiastical anthology was

SEATTLE, Wash., May 20. - Jasper
Nesstiroad, a leading logger of thii State,
was shot to-day at 10 o'clock on one of
the busiest thoroughfares of "Whatcom by
Harry Stewart, who arrived this morning
from Nevada. Stewart emptied his re
volver at him, one of the bullets striking
him in the groin. The wound will prob
ably prove fatal.
Nesselroad is running a large logging
camp at .Lake Whatcom, and Mrs. Stew
art is in his employ as cook. Last year
both Stewart and his wife were employed
by Nesselroad, but they subsequently
moved to Nevada. Mrs. Stewart Bays her
husband was getting good wages, but is
addicted to drink. A month ago be fur
nished her money to come back to What
com, and he was to return latar. Lately
she received threatening letters from him
and at last he said he had started for
Whatcom.
Mrs. Stewart and Nesselroad were in
town this morning when Stewart anived.
The latter had aconveriation with her and
also with Nesselroad, and became angered.
He went to his valise, loaded his revolver,
and at a distance of four feet commenced
firing at Nesselroad, who turned and ran.
He was reloading his gun when a police
man arrested him.
Stewart is sober and cool and admits all
the facts, but says little. He is 42 years
eld and has lived in several places in Ne
vada and Washington previously. The
relations of Nesselroad and Mrs. Stewart,
so the husband claims, have been of too
intimate a nature, and this is supposed to
have been the real motive actuating Stew
art.

There is one sacred, because historic,
spot in this commonwealth which should
long ago, by gift, purchase, or in some
other way, have become the property of
the Staie. We reler to the picturesque
locality variously known as "Stage Fort,'
"Stage Head" and "Fishermen's Field,"
in Gloucester. It juts out into the harbor
between the Cut bridge over the canal to
the Annisquam River and Fresh-water
Cove, and is conspicuous from the railroad
trains entering the city because of the
handsome avenue of ennsleading through
it. Its chief service of late years has been
to furnish an accessible circus-field, ex
cepting to those drawn to it to view fiom
the shore the magnificent sweep of the
outer harbor, to lish from its rocks, or to
ponder the story of the day when it was
the site of the fishing station of the "Dor

Pilgrims made their first landing. "Fish
ermen's Fie.d," on Cape Ann, the site of
the first Puritan landing and settlement,
has always been in private hand?, though
generously kept open to the puolic.
By a fortunate* train of circumstances
this property still remains practically in
tact. Gloucester has for years been hopiu s
to be financially able to purchase it for a
park, but this has thus far been impossi
ble. A few years since it was rumored
that Cornelius Vanderbilt hau puichased
it and would erect a summer villa, and
great was the consternation in the city j

Do you want
the earth?
Well, you come pretty near
getting it when you patronize
our Hat Department. jj
The regular hatters all over
town are kicking like fun at the
manufacturers because they
continue to sell us hats. We
shave the margin of profit
right down to bedrock and it
makes the hatters squeal.
Here is a new Fedora, for
instance, that we have in five
fashionable shades â black,
brown, maple, otter and cedar.
This hat is sold everywhere
else in this city for $2.
We sell it at $1.35.
Simply a matter of smaller
profits, more sales that's all.

fEMALE PENSIONERS.
Widow* of Men Who Saw Active Service
in the War of the .Revolution.
Seven women are still drawing pensions
as the widows of men who saw active
service in the War of the Revolution
women whose husbands served under
Washington more than 120 years agoâ
writes Clifford Howard in the February
Ladies' Home Journal. The eldest of
these surviving widows of the Revolution
is living at Los Angeles, Cal. She ia Mrs.
Lovey Aidrich, now in the 98th year of
her age. Her husband was Private Caleb
Aidrich, who was born in the year 1763,
and served as a soldier boy in the New
England campaigns of the war.
Mrs. Nancy Jones of Jonesboro, Term ,
whose husband was Darling Jones, a pri
vate in one of the North Carolina regi
ments, is the youngest of the revolutionary
winows, being now about 83 years of age.
The other five are Nancy Cloud, who is liv
ing at Cburr.Va., and in the widow of Ser
geant William Cloud of Captain Chris
tian's Virtrinia line: Esther 8. Damon of
Plymouth Union, Vt , whos-p husband was
Private Noah Damon of Massachusetts;
M:iry Snead, living at Parksley, Va.,
wldowof Private Bo wdoin Snead; Nancy
A. Weathirman, who lives at Elk Mills,
Term., and whose first husband was
Robert Glascock, tifer in one of the Vir
ginia regiments, and Rebecca Mayo, living
at Newbern, Va., widow of Stephen Mayo,
a soldier from Virginia. That these
women can be the widows of revolution
ary soldiers is readily understood in view
of the fac- that their husbands were well
on in years when they married. As, for
example, when Esther Surr.ner married
Noah Damon, in the year 1835 â fifty-two
years after the close of the warâ she was
bat 21, while he was 76. The last revolu
tionary widow pensioner who had mar
ried prior to the close of the war, and uad
therefore actually lived during the revolu
tionary times, was Nancy Serena, widow
of Daniel F. Bakeman. She dieit about
twenty-seven years ago, only a year or
two after her husband, who was the last
of the revolutionary soldiers on the pen
sion roll.
An enterprising Scotch minister in Mel
bourne has arrayed bis male choristers in

strains of the bagpipe and the church is

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 21, 1897.
PLAYGROUNDS FOR
THE CHILDREN
Each Public Park Will)
Have a Plat Dedicated
to Them.
A New Plan Adopted by the
Street Committee of the
Supervisors
The Depot of the Park and Ocean
Road Must Be Mcmd Within
Ninety Days.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors has decided on a measure
that will be a godsend to thousands of
children who, in the narrow confines of
this big City, have little or no place
for recreation, and are prevented on ac
count of the expense of the trip from mat
ing frequent visits to the people's play
ground â Golden Gate Piirk.
In future each publii park and square
wiil have its children's playground, where
the little ones can tumble about in the
grass at their pleasure, with no fear of the
big blue-coated policeman or burly gar
dener, who now keep them at a distance
from the enticing green sward.
Chairman Devany of tho committee
made a tour of the parks and squares on
Tuesday and instructed the gardeners to
set aside a plat in each one for the use of
the children and not to interfere with the
youngsters as long as they keep within
their boundaries.
Then he instructed them to select some
sheltered spot and have an area boarded
in ami filled with clean white sand, where
tue babies can play unaÂ«r tfce watcuful
eyes of their nurses or attendants.
Some of the gardeners demurred on
the ground that tlie trrass would soon be
so worn by the children's feet as to ruin
the j od.
'â¢Then move them to another place and
give the grass a chance," answered Mr.
Devany, and the gardeners had to be con
tent. It may be remarked that Mr. Dev
any is a man of family and that he appre
ciates how much the children will wel
come this scheme to give them pleasure.
The chairman reported the matter to
the committee yesterday for Its approval
and all agreed that the plan was a good
one.
The committee took up and discussed
the matter of widfuine Stanj'an' street
and considered the reply of the Market
street Railroad Company to a recent in
quiry as to when the corporation would
b â  ready to move the depot and fences of
the Park and Ocean road that now en
croach on the thoroughfare that it is pro
posed to imDrove.
It is the plan of the committee not only
to widen Stanyan street, but to provide a
new entrance to Golden Gate Park
through the southeastern corner for the
convenience of the people of the Mission
It was decided to require the company
to move the depot and fences within
ninety days, and the following report was
prepared for presentation to the board:
Regarding the communication of the Mar
ket-street Railroad Company, rile,ii May 17,
1897, stating that a proposition for the Con
vening of the present steam road of the Park
aud Ocean Railroad Company into an electric
road is under consideration, which, if accom
plished, will doubtless lead tUe directors to
co-operate in any leasible plan for the im
provement of that portion of Stanyan street
covceii by its station buildings, etc.
la this matter, your committee would stato,
while desiring to accommodate the company
as far as practicable, ihu main question as to
when the company would remove its station
and buildings from the street bas inadvert
ently remained unanswered.
Your committee, therefore, reports in favor
of requiring the Market-street Railroad Com
pany to remove the depot fences and build
ings within a period oi ninety days.
The committee consideied bids for gild
ing Loita's Fountain, and decided to rrc
ommend that tlie contract be awarded to
J. H. Keefe, whose b d was s24s. The other
t->nder> were S. & G. Gump $475, Thomas
Downing $350 and M. Stein $2rJ5.
No advertisements are to be allowed on
the fences that will surround the fountain
while the work is under way, and the job
must be finished within fifteen days to the
satisfaction of the Mayor.
It was decided to recommend that the
Market-street Company be instructed to
pi. -ice gates for the safety of pedestrians
and teams at the following crossings:
Townsend and Eighth streets, Harrison and
Sixteenth, San Jose and Circular avenues,
Ocean avenue and Southern Pacific Railroad
crossing opposite the brancn jaiis, San Jose
and Plymouth avenues, Temh and Braunan
streets, Potrero avenue and Division street,
Ninth, Utah and Division ; Army and Guerrero,
San Josi and Sickles avenues.

The event last night was the crowning
of Lawrence Bauer as king. He gained
this royal prerogative for his luck or skill
in shooting away the last piece of the
eagle. He secured, aside from the honors,
a cash prize of $150 and a medal valued at
?50. At 10 o'clock last night he was duly
escorted to the stage in the main hall dur
ing a pause in the dancing, and there in
the presence of the vast assembly crowned
king of all the marksmen.
CHILDREN POISONED.
Bye Bread, in Consequence, Sent to the
Board of Health to Be
Analyzed.
Four children of Abram Sngerman, 322
Thirteenth street, are supposed to have
been poisoned by eating rye bread, and
Professor Wenzcll of the Board of Health
will make an analysis of the bread to as
certain whether it contained anything of
a p>isonouÃ nature.
Three of the childrenâ a baby 19 months
old, a boy 5 years old and a giri 10 â ate a
portion of the bread between 2 and 3
o'clock Wednesday nfternoon and drank
some milk. Almost immediately after
the three children turned deathly sick and
vomited and retched to such an extent
thai Mrs. Sugarman became alarmed and
sent for Dr. Soboslay, the family physi
cian.
He thought it was an attack of colic and
prescribed accordingly. Wi.en a little
sirl 7 years of age returned from school
she ate a portion of the bread, but drank
no milk, and she suffered in the same
way as the others, and the parents con
cluued th-re must have been something
wrong with th<- bread and gave the re
maining portion of the loaf to Policeman
M. Anle:son, who, as instructed by Cap
tain Gillen, took it to the Board of Heaith
yesterday morning for analysis.
Sugerman refuses to give the name of
the baker until he learns the result of the
analysis.
SOME QUEER BAIL BONDS
Chief of Pol.Ci Lees Reads a
Lesson to tbe Police
Judges.
Warned to Be Careful of Bonds That
R present Property in San
M teo County.
Chief of Police Lees extended an invi
tation to the Judges and prosecuting at
torneys of all the Police Courts to meet
him in conference yesterday morning in
regard to bail-bond matters and particu
larly in regard to the case of Mabel Keat
ing, the notorious pickpocket.
Judges Joachimsen and Conlan and
Prosecuting Attorneys Graham and Ho
gan, also Clerk Foley of Conlan's court,
met the Chief.
Judge Low is away on his vacation and
Judge Campbell did not appear on ac
count of illness.
The recent order issued by the Chief to
his officers on jail duty not to liberate any
prisoner on an order from any Judge ex
cepting the one who committed him was
discussed and the first opportunity will be
taken to test its legality. When this comes
tue prisoner will be brought before the
Superior Court on a writ of nabeas corpus
and a decision obtained.
The Chief cautioned the Judge in regard
to accepting bail bonds waere the prop
erty represented lay on the boundary line
of San Mateo Coun ty, as tbere were any
number of boeus deeds to such lands on
the market.
At the suggestion of the Chief Judge
Joachimsen issued a bench warrant for
the arrest of Mab.-l Keating and Minnie
Moran. Tnese women were held on a
charge of vagrancy a few days ago, and, as
the Chief was unaware that a felony
charge was pending against the Keating
woman, he did not oppose the request of
her attorney to allow ncr to go on ncr own
recognizance, providing she leave the
Skate. She failed to appear in court yes
terday morning, and the uencli warrant
was issued.
The felony case still hangs over the
woman, who first was allowed to go on
paying $500 cash bail. Sue subsequently
produced "straw" bonds in the sum of
$40uO, and they were accepted by Police
Jui_e Campbell.
Judge Conlau, however, refused to ac
cept the bonds and Captain Lees Das in
structed Clerk Foley of Conlttu's court not
to pay over the $500 cash bail. It is tnis
money tliat forms tue bone of contention
now oetween Attorney Arthur Mack, the
Keating woman's counsel, and Clerk
i- n cv, who is threatened with a suit lor
$10,000 damages.
Another suggestion made to the prose
cuting attorneys by the Chief was tne, ad
visa bi ity of carefully reading documents
forc.Â«stjs appealed to the Superior Court.
As a rule they are drawn by ihe attorneys
lor t!iedefen>e, who wedge in a bug or two
somewhere not in accordance with the
record of the cases. These are discovered
when tue cases aie heard on appeal and
thrown out of court.
"In my judgment." said the Chief, "it
should be the duty of the Police Court
Prosecuting Attorneys to follow up to the
Surenor Court all cases sent thereon ap
peal from their respective departments."
As an illustration of the rtis^s practiced
by some of the alleged attorneys who im
pose upon the Judges of the Police Courts,
it was mentioned that in order to save the
arrest of a notorious woman named Min
nie Moran, her legal representative de
clared that sue did not appear in court to
be tried on the vagrancy charge becau>e
he had every reason to believe she had
been drowned recently off the cud of Pow
ell-street wharf.
A bench warrant, however, has been
issued.
THE OITY CEMETERY.
Rssldents of the Richmond District
Ask for It* l-> â nioval.
The citizens of the Richmond district
held a masÃ-meeting last evening under
the auspices of tne Richmond District
Improvement Association in Simonds'
Hall on California street and Fourth ave
nue. Tne attendance was large. The
special object of the gathering was to dis
cuss and advocate the removal of the City
Cemetery from tbat locality.
A number of enthusiastic spseches were
made in which the speakers sot forth facts
to show that the presence oi the burial
grounds in tbat locality was a hindrance
to the further progress of the district and
a menace to the health and safety of the
people living in the vicinity of the ceme
tery. t
Building Trades Council.
At the meeting of the Building/Trades Coun
cil last eveniug the report of Labor Commis
sioner E. L. Fitzgerald upon the labor situa
tion in tlie Sandwich Islands was read. A vote
of confidence was given to Mr. Fitzgerald, who
was sDoken of as an unselfish worker In the
interest* of the wage-earners of this City and
State. A resolution was jai-s d condemn
ing the appointment of Oscar Lewis as super
i n tenderi t of the new Postoffice building, to be
erected in this City. It was decided tore
quest the Pacific Coast representatives at
Washington to do all iv their power to prevent
Mr. Lewis from getting the position. The op
position is based upon t:>e ground that he is
an enemy of organized labor.
Goodwin in "The Kivaln."
An appreciative, if not a very large, audience
greeted Nat Goodwin and his company lust
night at the Baldwin Theater in "The Rivals."
The character of "fighting" Bob Acres suits
Goodwin infinitely better than that of David
Garrick. He kept the house amused when
ever he was on the stage last night, and
p ayed the part at the same time with a light
and whimsical touch which was tree from ex
aggeratlon. The rest of me cast wait good.
THE GOVERNOR
TALKS TO LEES
He Had a Busy Day In
vestigating the Dur
rant Case.
A Witness Appears Who Saw
Him Meet Minnie Williams
at the Ferry.
Another Que r Story, This Time
From a Man in Montevideo,
Colorado.
Governor* P.udd had another busy day
in San Francisco yesterday, going over
the testimony in the Durrant case and
listening to Eugene Deuprey, District
Attorney Barnes, Chief of Police Lees
and the woman, Mrs. Schwaitzer, who
asÂ«erts that she saw Minnie Williams and
Rev. J. George Gibson together on the
Alameda boat the day before the girl's
lifeless body was found in the Emmanuel
Church.
The Governor last night said that this
woman adhered to her story with great
persistency.
When ttie Governor was asked when he
would probably conclude his investigation
of the Durrant case he said be though he
would finish early next week, perhaps
Tuesday.
He remarked that he would go to Sac
ramento to-day, where much of the evi
dence was tiled, and there make a study
of the case. Next Tuesday he would
probably return to San Francisco, and on
Thursday he noped to be able to decide
the matter.
"Will you grant Durrant a hearing â
that is, grant him a personal interview?"
inquired the reporter.
"I think it is very doubtful," replied
the Governor. "His statement Cjin be
presented in writine."
In regard to Mrs. Durrant, the Governor
said he had not talked with her and pn b
abiy would not. He said he had heard
everything that Durrani's counsel, Deu
prey and Dickinson, had submitted.
During the hour between 5 and 6 o'clock
last evening ttie Governor was with Chief
Lees. Mrc. Schwaitzer's story was dis
cussed. The Governor again referred to
the positive assertion of t!ie woman that
she saw the pastor and Minnie Williams
on the boat at the time mentioned in her
story. The Governor said he had consid
ered the Minnie Williams case in some of
its bearings on the Blanche Lamont case.
Budd holds it to be his duty as chief
executivo to make an investigation of tnis
character when an application is duly
made for him to exumine trie lesiimony.
Under the law, he can pardon, jrrant a
respite or commute a sentence. He de
clined to foreshadow his decision in the
case now pending.
During his term of effice he has com
muted a sentence and in one instance
granted a respite, but the sentence of
de;nh was executed after the respite.
The death sentence has been i-xecutec 1
twelve or fifteen times since the Governor
came into office.
Chief Lees is now in possession of an
other strong link which he claims will
greatly aid in fusten'ng the crime of Min
nie Williams' murder on Theodore Dur
rant. This came to him as the result of
the publication of the 'void brick" yarn of
Gibson bein:: seen on the Aiameda ferry
boat with Minnie Williams on April 12,
1895.
A friend of Mrs. Eliza Witlee read the
story and called on the Chief to inform
him" that^lrs. Witlee could give some im
portant testimony relative to the last trip
of Miss Williams across the bay. She
gave Chief Lees a rough statement of what
Mrs. Witlee had told her, and the Cfcief
was so much impressed with it that he
abked his informant to find Mrs. Witlee
and send her to his office. His visitor
promised to do so and to-day appeared be
iore ihe Chief with Mrs. Witlen, who told
a snort but most interesting tale.
The murdered girl was well known to
Mrs. Witlee. On April 12, 1895, Mrs. Wit
tÂ«e took the narrow-gauge truin at High
street, Alameda, to come to this City. At
Park street Miss Williams boarded the
train and sat near Mrs. Witlee. On the
boat Miss Williams was also in sieht of
Mrs. Witlee during the entire trip.
Mrs. Witlec is positive no one was with
her young friend during the enure trip.
But she goes further, and is equally posi
tive in stating that when Minnie left the
boat she was me\ by Theodore Durrant
and that the couple went off together.
She admits she did not know Durrant at
the time, but recognized him some months
alter as being the man who met the young
girl '<t the lerry landing on Good Friday
in 1895.
It was in September of the same year
that her business of selling fruit called her
to the Prescott House at ttie corner of
Pacific and Kearny streets. Here she saw
a large and excited crowd on their way
toward the County Jail. She inquired the
cause of the excitement, and learned tnat
Durrant was on his way in the prison van
to the County Jail. She went to the jail,
and the second man who got out she at
once recognized a-* the man who met Min
nie Williams at the ferry landing on April
12, 1895. It was at this time that she
learned the man's name was Durrant.
Shortly after this she imparted her in
formation to As-istant District Attorney
Peixoito, who made a note of it for future
uÂ«e, should the Minnie Williams case ever
come to trial.
A SILVER BRICK.
Colorado Furnishes a Mate to the
Gold Brick of Mrs. Schwaitzer.
Another fairy tale concerning the Dur
rant case comes from the pink cliffs of
Colorado.
There is languishing in the Soldiers'
and bailors' Home in Montevideo, in that
State, a man who says he is an old '49er
of California, and that his name is Cap
tain W. H. Bryan.
He recently wrote to a well-known lady
of this City informing Her that he wit
nessed the murder of Blanche Lamont,
and that if transportation were furnished
Him he would come to San Francisco and
testify to that fact.
He charged the lady not to speak to
any one concerning the communication
and warned her particularly against law
yers anl the police. He invited her to
visit him at the Soldiers' Home in Monte
video and convince herself as to the truth
of his statement, but more than once in
timated in his communication that he
would be well pleased to come here and
testify provided he were furnished with
transportation to this coast.
It was reported last night that he was
about to come and that he would testily
that he Imd seen a very prominent mem
ber of Emmanuel Baptist Church (not
Durrani) carrying the body of Blanche
L&raont up to the belfry.
This precious addition to the Durrant
literature has been telegraphed to the
New York dailies, and will doubtless ap
pear, -'with ail the thrilling details," in
the columns of the esteemed but very
guliibleiExaminer.
It will probably be disproved as readily
as were the vaporings of Rosenberg and
the marvelous narrative of Mrs. Schwait
zer, which were also first eiven to the
public through the medium of the Daily
Durrant.

BIG REAL ESTATE DEALS.
Pacific Bank Property Sold to
the Roya; Insurancs
Company.
Bovee, Toy & i-Oiiit g Handed the
Business â Another Bij
Sale.
One of the most important real estate
sales in this City for some time past was
consummated yesterday through the real
estate firm of Bovee, Toy & Sonutag. The
old Pacific Bank property on the north
west corner of Pine and Sansome streets
was purchased by the Royal Insurance
Company of Liverpool from the Conti
nental Insurance Company of Chicago.
The purchase price was $145,000. The
sale has been in the air for over a year,
but not until yesterday did all part'es ar
rive at an agreement. Rolla V. Watt,
manager for the purchasing pany, stated
that the Royal and the Queen insurance
companies will probably move into the
new quarters very soon unless it is de
cided to tear down the old bunding and
pat up a modern structure.
The property is about as valuable as any
in that part of the City. The site is
35:6^87:6 feet, and upon it is a three-story
brick structure, with a basement contain
ing tire and burglar proof vaults. If the
purchaser does not decide to build at once
it will occupy the basement, first and a
part of the second stories. The remainder
will be rented for offices. However, it is
only a matter of a year or two before a
'new building will be placed upon the lot.
The property has a history. For years
it was used by the bank, but in 1895 it was
sold to the People's Home Bank in the
settlement between tne two institutions
for $219,000. In February, 1896, the Peo
ple's Home sold the property lor $130,000
to the Continental Insurance Company, it
being the intention of this company to
establish its gÂ«neral office there. Since
then a number of improvements nave
boen made ther- on. These and the in
crease in real estate values in that localky
accounts for the increase of $15,000 over
the former purchase price.
.Baldwin & Hammond, the real estate
scents, yesterday sold at auction the
property on the southwest corner of Pow
ell and Ellis streets. The property, which
is particularly valuable /or business pur
poses, was Knocked down to William
Haas of Haas Bros, lor $142,000. John E.
Auzerais ot San Jose, executor of tne es
tate of E. Auzerais, ordered the sale. Tlie
attendance waa large, and the bidders
went into the contest for the possession oi
the block with much spirit. The prin
cipal struggle was between Mr. Haas and
J. D. Sullivan, who represented Mayor
James D. P elan. Mr. Sullivan started
witn a bid of $100,000, and the offers were
increased in $10,000 bids until nearly the
end.
The property in question consist" of a
corner lot, 48x75 feet in size, a;.d upon it
is a fine five-siory modern brick building.
J. R. Patton, the attorney representing
Mr. Auzerais, states that the latter had
a standing offer of $150,000 for the prop
erty, and in his opinion the sale will not
be confirmed by the executor.
Shooting and Fighting;.
To-day the mu.-h talked oi Stale tournament,
which is open to all sportsmen, will commence
at the Ingleside trap shooiiug grounds and
will end ou Sunday. Trap shooters from
Stockiou, Sacramento, San Jose and other in
terior towns will compete against the inani
mate target smashers ot this City and Oak
land.
A large number of live birds have been
trÂ«ippedfor this particular eveut. The prizes
are valunble.
The Olympic Club has matched Billy Smith
of Australiu and Henry Baker, the pugilist
who was whipped by Jefl'ries, ior its next tour
nament, which will be held in June. Smith
waa a good fighter a few yean ago, bat lie hai
seen his best days. Baker, it matters not how
fat he may be when he enters the ring, should
easily defeat Smith.

The establishment of the proposed free

There are people who believe that liber
alism and free speech will begin to get off
the earth about the year 1906. The reason
for the opinion is that Russia will have
then completed her Siberian railway, her
fortifications at V:aaivostock* and Port
Arthur and her $400,000,000 fleet, and will
be ready to settle all questions off-hand
without debate and without troubling

she is quoted as saying: "There is going

woman, and when the old-fashioned
woman comes in again she will stay in."
All of which means, of course, that Mrs.
Barr feels herself a little old-fashioned
and desires another inning.
One of the effects of the passage of the
Greater New York bill is that most of the

arranced to borrow $12,500,000 to improve
Ler school facilities, and of course she will

while the tax will be spread out over the
"Greater" with an absolute impartiality.
OUR INTERESTS AT STAKE.
All reports from Washington tend to the one conclusion that the interests of the
"West in the coming tariff will be to a large extent antagonized by powerful combina
tions in thÂ« East. Some of the leading Republicans in the Senate have already given
us formal notice of opposition to the rates fixed upon fruits and raisins, while the
entire press of ihe East Las made it certain that we shall find considerable difficulty
in maintaining the duties proposed on carpet wools, lead and hides.
We have repeatedly called attention to the urgent need of maintaining the Senate
duties on citrus fruits, while striving to regain the Dingley duties on prunes, raisins
and other dried fruits. It is time now to direct attention to the wine industry of the
State, and to point out that this also needs to be guarded against the dangers that
threaten it.
Under the Dlngley bill there was provided a duty of 60 cents per gallon upon still
wines. This the Senate Finance Committee has cut down to 30 cents. The original
duty was none too hi^h, and the proposed reduction, if carried out, will prove dis
astrous to this extensive industry of the State.
The wine industry of California is not at present in a condition to withstand the
heavy blow aimed at it by tne proposed reduction in the amount of protection to be
granted it by the Government. It is well known that even with the present good
prices for wine our vineyards are languishing. In many localities they have suffered
severe ravages caused by disease among the vines. To replant and restore the in
jured vineyards we must maintain at least the present price even if we cannot succeed
In gaining better. The present duty of 30 cents a gallon has been tried and experience
furnishes abundant proof that it is not sufficient for the needs of the industry.
Competent experts in the wine trade estimate that for the advancement of the
vineyards of California there i 3 needed nt least a duty of 60 cents per gallon on wine
in cask, and $'2 50 per case on bottled goods. To secure these rates ia the duty of the
California delegation in Congress, and this duty it seems they can perform with suc
cess if they combine with other Western Senators to maintain the proposed duties on
hides, wool and lead.
The is3ue is of sufficient importance to engage the attention of all Calilornians
who have any concern in the promotion of our industries. The tariff which will bo
adopted this session of Congre-s will probably remain virtually unchanged for the rest
of this generation. The country has now been engaged for upward of twelve years
in discussing tariffs, during which time it has trie! no less than three successive bills.
Public opinion is averse to any further disturbance of the subject, and the tariff which
is made this year will be accepted by all parties through a sheer weariness of the sub
ject. We must, therefore, protect our industries now, or we will hare little chance of
protecting them in future.
The people of the West will sustain their Senators and Representatives in the House
in making a vigorous fight for Western interests. For the sake of speedy enactment
of the tariff we will cordially compromise, as far as can be reasonably expected, but we
must draw the Hue at the point where compromise would mean a sacrifice of our in
terests and our industries.
THE IEEE MARKET.
The discussion on Wednesday between
the State Harbor Commissioners and rep
resentatives of the State Grange and Pat
rons of Husbandry concerning the pro
posed free market in this City brought
forth but two facts of importance. These,
however, were sufficient to show that the
enterprise is one which, cannot be carried
out with wisdom or efficiency until it has
been more thoroughly considered.
The facts of note which were disclosed
during the discussion were that the quan
tity of fruit and perishable products an
nually coming to San Francisco from the
farms of California hardly lall3 short of
'200,000 tons, and that as no wharf of the
City has a capacity exceeding 2000 tons at
least five wharves would be necessary to
supply accommodations for the proposed
markets. The figures were given by Com
missioner Harney, and may be accepted
as accurate.
Every reflecting citizen will draw from
these fieures the conclusion that the prob
lem involved in the proposed market is
one of considerable complexity. It will
require no little study to devise a means
for making a public market for so large an
amount of perishable products as comes
to this port. The amount of wharf space
required will be large, and there will have
to be appliances provided for the econom
ical handling of the goods. It would be
unreasonable, therefore, to expÂ°ct any
hasty action upon tho subject. We must
determine the extent of the enterprise
and count the cost before we begin to lay
the foundations.
It Is gratifying to know thatthe Farmers'
Club #f this City has decided to take up
the consideration oi the subject, and* is at
present engaged in obtaining the data
which will be required for the solution of
the various problems involved. When
all the facts have been gathered and care
fully digested we will then b3 able to ap
proach the subject with fair prospects of
finding a proper solution for all of its prob
lems. In the meantime it is well to keep
the subject before the public, and it is to
be hoped that at the nest discussion be
fore the Harbor Commissioners, which
has been fixed to take place next week,
more in the way of facts and statistics
will be submitted than was the case at the
meeting on Wednesday.
CAENIVALS IN CALIFOKNIA.
Is the California iiesta on the decline?
The anxious query is inspired by cer
tain dubious intimations let fall re
cently by our interior contemporaries.
These journals are closely acquainted
with carnivalism in its various stages,
many of them having been afflicted with
it at one time or another, and they may
be presumed to know something of its
prospects for the future in their respec
tive localities.
They somewhat vaguely give the im
pression that, so far as they are concerned,
the prospects are not particularly rosy,
the suggestion being that, while a carni
val itself may be enjoyable as an enter
tainment of the festive moment, the aft
ermath may turn out a consideiably less
prosperous epoch than they (the news
papers) had been jollied into predicting as
its inevitable consequence.
The papers of Los Angeles seem to be
not exactly pleased with the taste which
lingers with them from the last fiesta
that they witnessed. The final night
of the carnival, when revels ran
high and the heels of the silken-hosed
women ran higher, when all the saloons
in town were crammed with hilarious
frolickers, when society executed the
skirt - dance to the confusion of the
moon and all his modest stars, and
Rome of 2000 years ago was revived
for a night, still lingers unpleasantly
in many minds thereabouts, and would
gladly be eradicated from local history if
Dame Gossip would consent to forego so
savory a morsel for her unctuous tongue
to dally with.
Los Angeles' fiesta of 1897 has evidently
driven a nail in the coflin of carnivalism
in California. The fashion may recover
the shock and live to see the nail rust In
the coffin boards and the boards them
selves become petrified with amazement
at its exuberant vitality, but present indi
cations point otherwise from more direc
tions than one. Santa Cruz turned against
carnivahsm last year after its most elabo
rate effort in that line. Such seems to be
the usual course by which the fashion
will be led to an early grave.
As to the desirability of such an end,
some tentative deductions may be drawn
from past experiences. It is now generally
conceded that carnivals are cot, in the
long ran, profitable to a community,
which removes the practical argument in
their favor. This leaves them to be con
sidered merely as occasions of amusement,
in which light they indubitably shine.
And there is something pleasing in the
idea of these flowered gatherings disport
ing themselves in the spring sunshine as
merry children of nature. The theory is
beauteously pristine in its innocence.
"Throw off dull care" and be children
again amid the flowers and the bright rib
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MA.V 21, 1897-
bons and the gorgeous undulating rain
bows of sound which bubble from a thou
sand irresponsible throats. It is all very
nice â if it is so realized. The numerous
exceptions to such a realization give it
another color. That is what makes it
doubtful that carnivals will long survive
where recollections of the exceptions are
alive.
THE CUBAN SITUATION.
The most important feature of the de
bate on tho Cuban resolutions in the Sen
ate on Wednesday was the presentation
of certain state documents on the subject.
One of these was a report from an Ameri
can official in Cuba whose name was not
given, but who is well undeistooa to be
Consul-General Lee, and the other a letter
from Secretary Oiney to the Spanish Min
ister de Lome.
The report from Cuba denies the claim
of the Spaniards that any provinces of the
island have been pacified, and expresses
the opinion that since the Spaniards can
not conquer the insurgents nor the insur
gents expel the Spaniards from the
island, "the war will drag its weary
length along so long as the insurgents can
dig sustenance from the ground, or money
be obtained from any source by the Span
iards." The report adds:
The poverty and distress of the people are
Increasing, and the loss of property ot all Â«orts
is daily becoming enormous. No one can fully
appreciate the situation without being here in
person. The number of poor, distressed, starv
ing women, children and old men of all races
iias greatly increas-d la this city within the
past few weeks, while in other points on the
island the suffering has been proportionately
The letter of Secretary Olney was
clearly based on information in this re
port, or else on similar information from
other sources. He point* out to the
Spanish Minister that nearly a year had
elapsed since the prospects of putting an
end to the insurrection were first dis
cussed, and that nothing had occurred
since that time to justify the conclusion
that the Spaniards would be able to
speedily put an end to the war, or even to
afford protection to American citizens
and the property of non-combatants dur
ing its continuance. Speaking of the in
terest of tbe United States in the struggle,
the Secretary said :
We are interested in the prevention of that
wholesale destruction of property on the
island, which is making no discrimination
between enemies and neutrals ana is utterly
destroying many American investments that
should be of Immense value and is impoverish
ing great numbers of American citizens. On
all these questions and in all these ways the
interest of the United Slates in the existing
situation in Cuba yields only to that of Spain
herself and has led many good and honest
persons to insist that intervention to ter
minate the conflict is the immediate and im
perative duty of the United States.
On this showing of the condition of
affairs in the island, and on this state
ment of our interests in the subject, it
appears that our Government would be
clearly justified in promptly intervening
to put an end to the war. In the face of
such reports it was but the obstinacy of
folly on the part of Senator Hale and
Senator Wellington to assert that the
sentiment in favor of Cuban independence
among the American people is based
upon "mere newspaper reports." The
official documents prove that the reports
published in the newspapers are correct.
It is not to be wondered, therefore, that
a majority of tho members of both houses
of Congress are in favor of the Morgan
resolution, and that its adoption by the
Senate followed promptly the report of
the facts.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
The Carnival Fundsâ F. H. C, City. The
committee that had charge of the Golden Gate
Carnival is endeavoring to raige means with
which to liquidate expenses and liabilities in
curred. If the funds are raised it is probable
that the prizes offered will be given.
A Patentâ F. D. H., City. How to obtain a
patent was detailed in full in Answer* to Cor
respondents in the issue of May 1. The cost
of securing a patent is a Government fee of
$35. Then it cost* about $40 more to fee a
lawyer aud to prepare drawings or model.
That is the cost in ordinary cases.
Cleveland's Substituteâ G. T., City. That
Grover Cleveland paid a substitute to take his
place during the war is not disputed, but the
s:ory that his substitute while on a bed of
sickness appealed to him in vain, is one that
was denied. This department has not been
able to discover anything that would authori
tatively confirm or deny the story.

To Exterminate Red Antsâ G. a. H., City.
Grease a plate with lard and set it where these
insects abound. They prefer lard to anything
else and will forsake sugar for it Place a few
sticks around the plate for the anti to climb
up on. Occasionally turn the plate bottom
up over a fire, and the ants will fall in with
the melting lard. Reset the plate, and in a
short time you will catch them all. Powdered
borax sprinkled around the infested placet, it
is said, will exterminate both red and black
ants.

THE SOFTEST SNAP.
I liave looked Â»bout this world here
Fora really good profession;
I have sat up with' my daddy
In full many a weary session.
We have talked of surgery, and
We have talked of medicine;
We have talked about the lawyers,
And the laurels poets win.
We have looked the whole field over
With the deepest meditation
For the thing exactly suited
To a fe.low of my station.
We havj thought of architecture;
We have bothered those In art:
\YÂ« have likewise looked deep into
The conditions of the mart.
I have tried my hand at musicâ
I've composed a tnurcli ilia's dirgy;
I have even gone iO far that

Bui I've missed the one vocat on
That has held the highest charm.

THE UNEMPLOYED
It Will Probably Bs Ef
fected on Sugar- Beet
Lands.
Spreckels Assures the Committee
of His Willingness to
Co* Operate.
Matters Will Probably Be in Shap
to Locate the First Colonists
Next Winter.
As the result of the conference held be
tween Glaus Spreckels, ex-Mayor Ellert
and Major Winchell of the Salvation
Army yesterday, at the office of the sugar
King, one of the great industrial and
social problems is In fair shape to be
solved in a rnoit satisfactory manner in
this State. Employment will b-3 provided
for all who are sincere in their assevera
tions that they desire the opportunity to
earn an hone?t livelihood, and at the
same time a great industry will be ex
tended within the borders of the State.
The conference mentioned was brought
about as tiie result of the suggestion made
by Commander Booth-Tucker of the Sal
vation Army, who is the father of the
idea of colonizing the unemployed on un
occupied lands, with the ultimate view of
allowing the colonists to become the
owners of the tracts upon which they may
be put to work.
While thousands of acres of grain and
fruit lands have been placed at the dis
posal of the committee having the matter
in hand, they look with greatest favor on
the sugar-beet section of the State as offer
ing the best promise of success. Tha
beet-sugar industry offers employment to
a greater number of men to the specified
acreage than grain or fruit growing, and
there is no danger of over-production.
As already toid in The Call, a confer
ence was arranged for between a sub-com
mittee of the citizens' committee having
the colonization scheme in charge and
Claus SpreckeU to ascertain If the latter
would co-operate in the matter. This con
ference took place yesterday and was most
satisfactory to all concerned. Mr. Spree
keb entered most heartily into the spirit
of the work and assured the committee,
comprising ex-Mayor Ellert and Major
Winchell, that lie would do everything in
his power to aid them in colonizing num
bers of the unemployed on sugar-beet
iands.
He offered to place at the disposal of the
committee sugar-beet land which ha had
purchased recently, to see that the colo
nists were given the necessary instruc
tions for the raising of oeets and agreed
to purchase the product at the regular
market price, which is $-1 a ton, and which
returns a handsome profic to the pro
ducer.
This is all liiat the committee desires,
and at the next meeting of t tie main com
mittee a report will be adopted on the re
commendation of the *Ã¼b-committee that
the colonization of the unemployed be
first tried on beet-sugar land.
It will take all the time between now
and next winter to get the lands into
shape for the intending colonists, and in
the meantime the committee will devote
itself to raising the necessary fund for pro
viding the colonists wiih implements,
shelter, provisions and clothes until they
have disposed of their first crops. This, it
is estimated, will require about $25,000.
How this amount is to be raised has not
yet been decided. It will probably be in
the 8 nape of a loan, to be repaid ulti
mately by the colonists out of the profits
of their crops.
Should these plans be carried out Ban
Francisco will not again be conlronted
with the task of providing employment
for the destitute and unemployed during
the winter season, as has been the case for
several years past.
RELIEF FOR THE POOR.
Colonel Holland of the Salvation
Army Has Arrived.
Colonel Thomas J. Holland of the Sal
vation Army, general superintendent of
the men's social affairs, arrived in this
City from Portland yesterday. The
colonel is on a tour of inspection and has
already visited the principal cities of the
East. This is his first visit to San Fran
cisco, and he is particularly impressed
with the colonization scheme in Cali
fornia.
"The sugar-beet plan is the grandest
scheme ever designed for the benefit of
the poor. Everywhere in the East," he
said, "people are talking of the wonderful
works going on in California, and if the
idea proves successful, and there seems
to be no reason wJiy it shouldn't, scores of
Eastern cities stand ready to take up the
scheme. Many different plans haye been
adopted in order to rel;eve the unem
ployed and give them homes, but this one
is the complctest in all its details of
any I have ever run across."
"1 am much impressed by the public
spirited manner with which so many of
the leading citizens of San Francisco have
taken up tho matter of relief for the un
employed. I think I can truthfully say I
have never witnessed so much desire to
help on the part, ot any community. The
colonization plan especially suggests great
promise to my ninui, ami the army or
ganization, backed by such an influential
and able committee as is behind it, seems
to me to have within it all tho essentials
of immediate and permanent success. I
am very glad of the opportunity to make
the personal acquaintance of tha warm
hearted people of San Francisco."
Colonel Holland will be in this City only
a short while â ten days at the outside. He
says that he would like to be here when
the colonization scheme is put into opera
tion, but he has fears thnt it will be im
possible. However, Commander Booth-
Tucker has promised to come, so the
launching of the great scheino will have
the highest official backing.

suit against the company for a balance of

TROUBLE AHEAD
FOR MAX GUMPEL
Once the Pencil Will Was
Genuine, but Now a
"Drawing."
His Cotfl cting Opinions to Be
Exposed When He Is
Cross-Examined.
Expert Carvalbo Finishes His Testi
mony, and Confesses Hs Blun
dered oa the Morey Letter.
Now it's Expert Gumpel.
Expert Carvalho managed to worry
\ along through the cross-examination he
i was subjected to yesterday in the Fair
| Oraven trial â true, with the addition of
i several more gray hairs to his sprinslea,
head, but at least alive.
Max Gnmpel was "next," as the tonso
rial a.tist would say, but he did not reach
the cross-examination trouble before the
close of the session. Gunipel is apt to be
asked some sharp questions when he faces
W. W. Foote, one of Mrs. Nettie Craven's
leading defenders. .This because Mr.
Foote is said to possess information to the
effect that a year or so ago Max made an
exhaustive study of Senator Fair's hand
! writing and then compared it with the
I disputed "pencil" will produced by Mrs.
i Craven, with the result that he pronounced
i that document to be genuine â in the hand
[ writing of the deceased millionaire. That
: was at the time when the Fair children
j and their attorneys were all salaaming
! before Mrs. Craven and welcoming the
i pencil will as they would a winged angel
! from heaven. But now they are all on
the other side of the fence, the proposed
compromise with Mrs. Craven having
fallen through.
Gumpel shifted his base, too, so the
! story goes. He now says that the will is
I a fabricated initiument, and so declared
i under oath yesterday. Undoubtedly Mr.
I Foote is going to quiz him on that point,
and the attorney expects to bring, out
! some highly interesting developments.
There was the usual throng in Judge
Slack's courtroom when the proceedings
were resumed yesterday morningâ the
' crowd that always collects there when
j ever anything interesting is on tap. David
: Carvalho, the New York expert who has
i testified that the will and deeds are not
I genuine, took the witnesi-sland immedi
j ately and steadied himself for the begin
; ning of Mr. Foote 1 cross-query.
After Carvalbo had been made to tell
j abuut some of the celebrated cases be had
I testified in as an expert Mr. Foote plunked
i this at him:
"You testified in the Morey letter case,
j years ago, didn't you?"
"I did," was the reply.
As everybody doubtless remembers the
| Morey letter was the document that was
| sprung during General Garfield's cam
] paign for the Presidency and with which
I his opponents hoped to lessen his chances
lor success.
"And you pronounced General Gar
lield's signature to be genuine, too, didn't
you?" continued Mr. Foote.
"Yes, sir."
"And you afterward pronounced it not
his signature, isn't that so, too?"
"Yes, I am satisfied that it was not his
signature."
"But you had said that it was?"
"I did." â¢
"And then that it was not?"
"Yes."
"So yon made a mistake then?"
"I did."
Carvalho was going to explain, bnt Mr.
Foote said he was not asking for that. It
was sufficient for the jury to know that he
was not infallible.
In answer to another line of questions
the expert said he was receiving $100 a
day and expenses for his services to the
Fair estate. He has already received about
|6700, and something like 52300 more is
now due. He admitted that he had many
consultations with tbe attorneys for tbe
estate, but had always assured them that
tbe disputed documents were spurious.
Mr. Foote wanted to show that Carvalho
had testified that documents in dispute in
the Quackenbush case bad been tampered
with by use of acids, whereas Judge Seu
well had ruled that this was not true, but
tbe court woula not permit him to do so
for fear it would involve a retrial of the
Quackenbush case.
The baiting of Expert Carvalho by Mr.
Foote was resumed at the afternoon ses
sion, but was boou concluded.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY^ MAY 21, 1897.
"Can you tell by an examination of a
person's handwriting how old that person
was when he executed the document or
what his physical condition was?" asked
Mr. Foote.
"In a great many cases, yes," replied
Carvalho. "As age creeps upon the in
dividual the hand becomes stiffer and
slower of action and also wavers some
what. This migbt also be the result of
sickness."
"Would it not also cause more breaks
and spaces in the formation of the words ?"
"1 think it would."
"Breaks similar to those you have at
tempted to point out in the pencil will?"
â¢â¢Perhaps â in fact, quite likely."
"That's all I wanted to know," said Mr.
Foote, and then he announced that he
was done with the witness.
Redirect examination now being in or
der Attorney Mitchell asked Carvalho to
explain the circumstances under which
he happened to give two different expert
opinions regarding the Morey letter. In
reply he said that his first opinion â
namely, that the document was written
by General Garfield and was genuine â was
based simply upon an examination of a
purported reproduction of the letter in a
newspaper called Truth. Subsequently,
however, he saw the original document in
court, and then found that be was mis
taken in his first verdict. He said he ex
plained to Garfield by letter how he hap
pened to blunder.
Mr. Foote objected to this evidence as
being irrelevant, and considerable of it
was stricken lrom the record.
Mr. Mitchell next wanted to know more
of the details of the engagement of Car
valho by Herman Oelrichs to give an ex
pert opinion on the genuineness of the
pencil will. Carvalho said Mr. Oelrichs
sent for him in New York and submitted
to him a photographic copy of the will,
along with a number of letters in Senator
Fair's handwriting.
An effort was made to have Caryalho
say that when Oelricha employed him the
young millionaire believed tho pencil will
to De genuine, and that the expert crushed
his hopes in thai regard. The court would
not permit this to be done, though. Then
it was sought to have him testify that bin
compensation at the hands of the Fair
estate was no greater than he was in tho
habit of charging in all cases wherein he
is required to leave New York. The objec
tion to this was overruled, and Carvalho
renlied that he always charged $100 a day
for his services away from home.
This ended Carvalho's long seige on the
witness-stand, and Max Gumpel, the hand
writing expert of Sharon-trial fame, was
called. Max startled the crowd right at
the beginning by confessing that his given
name was not Max at all, but Michaelmas.
In answer to Mr. Mitchell's preliminary
inquiries, Gumpel said he was born in
Germany, and emigrated to this couutry
in 1870. He worked at his profession,
lithography, in various places, and in 1880
took charge of the lithographing depart
ment of H. S. Crocker & Co. For twenty
seven years, he said, he bad made a study
of handwriting, and had testified in the
courts of Calliurnia as an expert, over a
hundred times.
Then, petting down to business, the
witness said he had made an exhaustive
examination of letters written by Senator
Fair, but had seen only photographs of
checks bearing his signature. He had
also examined the disputed deeds, the
pencil will and Fair's letter to Mrs. Cra
ven. He did this at the solicitation of tho
executors of the Fair estate. As the re
sult of this scrutiny and employment he
Lad formed an opinion as to the disputed
papers.
When Gumpel was asked to give this
opinion Mr. Foote objected on the ground
that the expert was not com pe ten t to obey
this command because it appeared that
he had examined some of Fair's writings
that were not in evidence in the case. The
attorney said he would demand that ail of
these papers be produced in court.
Judge Slack ruled that he would per
mit the introduction of these outside let
ters and papers when the cross-examina
tion was reached.
ThiÂ» seemed to worry the attorneys for
the plaintiffs, for both Mr. Wheeler and
Mr. Mitchell made long arguments in the
l?ope of setting a mversal ot the ruling.
They said it bad not been shown that
Gumpel based his opinion altogether upon
those writings, but rather upon the checks
and letters formally placed in evidence.
The court would not be swerved from
the first ruling, and Gumpel was directed
to bring all of the letters he examined into
court.
Gumpel then gaTe his delayed opinion.
A? was to be expected, he being tbe plain
tiffs' witness and in their employment,
tbit opinion was to the effect that the
will, deeds and latter were all imitations.
He proceeded to explain why he reached
this opinion, and with chalk in hand he
demonstrated on the blackboard. He said
he found in Senator Fair's admittedly
genuine signatures a "life" and a "flu
ency" thai he could not discover in the
disputed writings. "Life" could only be
imparted to an imitation, said Gumcel, by
retouching the latter after it had been
written, lie said he believed that the
signatures in the deeds and other docu
ments in question had all been retouched,
and in some instances retouched in the
wrong places. Continuing, he took up the
San some- street deed, and said be found
that tbe signature was broken into more
pieces than was Fair's regular signature.
Gumpel was still undergoing direct ex
amination when court adjourned until
to-day.
A RUSH THROUGHT
THE GOLDEN GATE
Coasters and Deep -Sea
Vessels Pass. la To
gether.
One Record Broken, but the Ma
jority of the Wind-jammers
Made Long Trips.
The New Steamer Moana and the New
Folsom-Street Wharf Will Meet
Next Month.
A change came over the Golden Gate
yesterday. Instead of the monotonous
quiet that has prevailed for weeks past,
coaster after coaster, steamer after steamer,
and deep-sea ship after deep-sea ship hove
in sight and passed in. All had made
fair passages, and in every instance the
captains were more than glad to make
port.
The steam-schooner Laguna came in
with the cautain on the sick list. Every
thing went well until the vessel was off
Point Reyes. Tne steamer was caught in
a heavy sea and the boom jibed. It
caught CaDtain Peterson, knocking him
to the deck and seriously injuring him.
The vessel was brought into port fty tne
chief officer.
Another arrival was the British strip
Trafalgar, and John Rogers, ex-chief jailer
at the County Jail, is not likely to forget
her in a hurry. Rogers has always been
rememDered as the man who nad charge
of the hanging of Alex Goldenson, the
murderer of Mamie Kelly. Now he will
be known as the man who spent twenty
four hours in quarantine because he
boarded a ship before the Health Officer.
Since his time as a City and County officer
expired Rogers has been managing a
sailor boarding-house on the water iront.
When the Trafalgar hove in sight he
went out to her, and was in the forecastle
when Dr. Bleu boarded her. Rogers was
at once placed under arrest, and when the
examination of the ship's papers was com
pleted tie was taken to Angel Island.
There he will be bathed, his clothes fumi
gated and himself vaccinated. Then fie
will be brought back to the City. It is
safe to say that Rogers will not be
caught on an incoming ship again before
the quarantine officer arrives.
At least two dozen vessels passed
through the gate during the day. There
were nine steamers and steam schooners,
one ship, two barkentines ana tea or a
dozen schooners.
The steamer Washtenaw made a record
round trip to Tacoma. She left here a
week ago and after discharging iier sound
cargo took in 4850 tons of coal and got
back here yesterday. The round trip oc
cupied 7 days 15 hours, one of the quickest
on record.
The British ship Trafalgar had an un
eventful run from Newcastle, N. S. W.,
and the barkentine Archer â¢ long run of
22 days from Honolulu. The barkentine
Gleaner made a good run oi 6 days from
Grays Harbor, but the schooner Norms
took a long timeâ 26 daysâ coming here
from Tahiti.
Folsom-street wharf iÂ« nearing comple
tion, and next month it will be ready for
the Oceanic Steamship Company. The
first steamer to dock at it will be the new
steamer Moana, which has been built to
take the place of the Monowai. One of
the finest vessels of her class afloat and a
wharf that has no superior in the world
can thus be seen at the same time next
month. Chief Engineer Holmes of the
Harbor Commission has seen to it that
nothing is lacking in the equipment of
the wharf. Electric lights have been
placed in all the offices and along the
shed, and the discharging apron will be
worked by a patent hydraulic lift, which
will save an enormous amount of labor.
Chief Holmes has also made many im
provements nt the Second-street bridge.
At the present time hydraulic appliances
are being put in there. Heretofore it took
four men to handle the machinery. When
the changes hare been made one man
will be able to do all the work, and do it a
great deal better. The saving in salaries
alone will soon recoup the State.
In regard to the mutiny on the Belford,
it was stated that Dr. Hay was a practic
ing physician and in partnership with Dr.
McDonald, the well-known medico. Dr.
Hay is only here on a vacation, and will
leave early in July to till au important
position in one of the British hospitals in
India.
Yon Tiedemann In His Own Behalf.
Carl W. you Tiedeniftim, charged with pur
jury, took the witness-stand on his own behalf
yesterday. He denied all the allegations of
ihu witnesses that he was cognizant of thÂ«
crookedness of Uuy a VVhitcornb, wtio he said
engineered a scheme to fabricate a deed to
Mrs. Harriet P. Christy's real estate. He said
that he was a victim of the machinations of
Whitcomb and his associates and alleged that
he suffered on account of their evil deeds as
much as anybody. The case will occupy the
attention of the court all next week.
FARES REDUCED TO PORTLAND.
A Cut of S3 by Kail From thÂ« Regular
Kate.
The fares of excursionists on the Cali
fornia and Oregon road from here to Port
land are to be reduced. The new schedule
will go into effect on Sunday next. The
first-class fare, which has hitherto been
$21, will be reduced to $19, and the second
class fare, hitherto $14. will be cut to $12,
making a $2 reduction in both instances.
The rates to Puget Sound will remain un
changed.
The steamer rates from this City to
Portland are $12 and $<3 respectively. It
appears that for some little time past
more than the average passenger traffic
has been by way of the coast steamers.
This has been in the nature of a quiet
pointer to the railroad that its rates were
deemed too stiff.
Mr. Judah, however, who has been ad
justing the new schedule, says that the
reduction should not be regarded as a step
in the direction of reducing fares. The
way he puts it is that there has always to
be a certain relative adjustment of rates
between the steamers and the railroad
and the latter is merely now going back to
the rate it had in effect from July to De
cember last.
INSURANCE LITIGATION.
Payment of Policy Kef used on Property
Near Santa Rosa.
Lolla T. Allen has sued the Home In
surance Company of New York to recover
$2200. The plaintiff alleges that she held
an incurable interest in property near
Santa Rosa, and paid the premium de
manded by the company; that an error
was made in the policy whereby it was
made to appear that she was the owner
instead of the mortgagee of the property;
that sho did not detect the error until
after the property was destroyed by fire.
The company refused to pay, and as she
does not think she was to blame for the
mistake she demands the full amount
called for by the face of the policy.
A Daughter of Jerusalem.
Those who attended the sessions of the
Women's Congress will remember with
pleasure the tail, majestic, lair-haired
lady, young in years, who electrified the
audience with her eloquence nnd who bore
with her the warmth and poetry of the
Onent. The lady was Mrs. Van Finkel
stein Mountford, whose name is familiar
to all lecture-goers in the East and
throughout Great Britain and the Colo
nies. To those interested in Biblical
Orientalisms, her coming lectures at
Golden Gate Hall are a mine of wealth.
Her costumes are very rich and elaborate,
she is assisted by a dozen people, and the
stage settings and accessories are very
complete and elaborate. Her first enter
tainment will be given to-nigln, and all
appearances point to a crowded house.
Manuel Catin Sued.
Rosa Prieta Alvarez has sued Manuel Cesin
for $50,01)0 damages. She alleges that on the
Cth day of July, 1895, he deceived her by the
use of flattery, false promises and artifice, and
that said Casio is the father ot her child,
since born. She says that she was not able to
attend to her usual business and occupation
for a long time, ana that sne has suffered
greatly iv her reputation in the community.

The case of Alfred Lenormand, charged with

BOLD ROBBERY
ON TAYLOR STREET
George W. Wright, Sta
tioner, Held Up in
His Store.
The Robber Had a Revolver
and Cleaned Out the Cash
Drawer.
Wright Is Unable to Give an Accnr-

Excited at the Time.
A bold robbery was committed at the
stationery-store kept by George W. Wright
at 118 Taylor street, shortly after 9 o'clock
Wednesday night, when the street was
crowded with people.
Wrigttt and nis family live in the rear
of the store, a glass door leading from the
living apartments to the store. Wright
was in the rear playing with his children
for some minutes, and as he returned to
the store he saw the figure of a man
crouched behind the counter where the
cash-drawer is situated.
"Hello!" cried Wright, "what are you
doing there?"
The man jumped to his feet, and pull
ing a revolver out of his pocket pointed it
at Wright and said, "If you move another
step I'll fill you fall of lead."
Wright has only the use of his left arm,
but he did not intend to submit tamely to
being robbed, so he ran into the living
apartments and tried to pull open a
drawer where ne kept his revolver. The
drawer got stucK, and seeing her hus
band's excited condition Mrs. Wright
seized him by the wrist and asked him
what was the matter.
"There's a man in there robbing me,"
said Wrieht, "and he has a Run."
Mrs. Wright endeavored to hold her
husband, but he broke away from her and
ran into the store. The robber had been
backing from behind the counter, keep
ing i he revolver raised in I) is right hand,
and jast as Wright re-entered the store he
backed out of the door on to the sidewalk.
Wright hastily pulled out his police
whistle, but unfortunately it had got
clogged up and was useless. By this time
the robber had walked rapidly north and
disappeared round the corner of Â£ddy
street.
Tnere was $11 in the cash-drawer and
the robber had taken every cent.
Policeman Coleman, who patrol? Taylor
street, was at the time at the lire on
Larkin street, and was not informed of
the robbery for half an hour after it had
occurred. He and two detectives were de
tailed on the case by Captain Bohen yes
terday, but there is very little chance of
capturing the daring robber, as Wright
was too excited at tbe time to be able to
give any accurate description of him.
It is believed that the marauder was
acquainted with the locality and knew
where WrigUt kept his cash.
"If I had got my revolver out of the
drawer," said Wrieht yesterday, "I would
have shot him, and it is possible he would
have shot me, but I did not think of that,
I was so excited.
"When I saw him backing out of the
door my intention was to follow him along
the street and tackle him, but fortunately
I came to my senses and it flashed into
my mind that he had a revolver and I
hadn't.
"I tlierefore polled my police whistle
out of my Docket, but it was luil of atuS
and I couldn't use it. By that time the
man had disappeared round the corner of
Eddy street.
"I was so excited that I cannot give
much of a description of the man. He
was a tall, stout man, and wore a light
suit. That is about all the description I
can give of him."

Mr. Edmond Pait, 1721 Berkeley Way,
Berkeley, CaJ., says: " 1 am 54 years old,
and was attacked two yeara a#o with
rheumatism in my limbs. For weeks I
could scarcely walk around. I did not
try doctors because of lack of faith, but
I used various remedies in an effort ta
secure relief. Finally I secured Mun-
yon's Rheumatism Cure, and after taking
two bottles, not being: cured, I gave it up
In disgust, but resuming 1 it again, I took
It for a short time- and find that it com-
pletely cured me."

Racing for Charity's Cause at Emery
villeâTwo Favorites Only
Scored.
EmoryTille track furnUbed some racing
yesterday for the cause of charity. The
attendance *was not above tha average,
bat quite a striking feature marked the
sport.
Lucretia Borgia, a meek-looking, rather
under-sized daughter of imp. Brutus
and 1/edette, was down on the card to go
against the coast four-mile record of
7:2<% held by Marigold. With eighty-live
pounds in the way of little Clawson in the
saddle, she not only accomplished the
feat, but at the same time lowered the
world's record for the distance held by
Ten Broeck, who carried 110 pounds as a
five-year-old, and set the mars at 7:15%.
The Brutus mare, paced after the fi;st
mile by two stable companions, reeled off
the first mile in 1:50, the two miles in
3:35}^. the three miles in 5:22%, and the
four miles in 7:IL
The record-smasher, a chestnut just
turned 4 years, stepped the last half mile
in 54)^ seconds, finishing but slightly dis
tressed. Owner Charles Boots will be pre
sented with a silver cup, and the jockey,
Ciavrson, will be given a handsome gold
mwal.
The rest of the racing was marked by
nothing oat of the ordinary, unless it was
the downfall of four weil-piayed favorite?.
Crescendo started iv the opening rive
furlong scramble a 1 to 2 choice. With
only a band of "dogs" to beat he was away
next tc last and finished among the "ai-o
rans. " Jeriiaerio, a bo to 1 shot, won in a
drive from Chappie, another rank out
eider.
The six-furlong selling event next de
cided looked rather easy for the 8 to 5
favorite Anabasis, but Snider managed to
get cut off two or three times with him
before the stretch wag reached, and, al
though coming very last at the end, was
beaten out a length by Reel, the 9 to 2 sec
ond choice, piloted by Stevens. Dolore
was third.
Billy McClosky was the warm tip for
the mile and a quarter, and had Ames
not gone to pieces toward the end, tbe
chestnut would have landed the purse.

Good stHrt. Won driving. Wlauer, J. H. Tarn's v h., by Emperor of -Norfolk- Winona.
1:16
He was backed down to 4 to 1. and in a
drive v.-as boÂ«ten out but a head by the 8
to 5 choice Collins, with Clawson in the
saddle. Oakland, the second choice,
could not scare ud a gallop.
The wise ones figured The Roman a
"pipe" for the mile and a sixteenth, not
withstanding the fact that bss last per
formance was not one to exult over. He
went to the post a 3 to 5 choice, and was
beaten out withon 1 much effort by bat
suma, the second clioice, well ridden by
Patsy Freeman. Marty Bergen got Ta
ran to home in the show. â¢
Fred McCnllongh had Del Paso II right
up to it, and the big brown horse was the
real thing in the mile purse, sixth on the
programme. Heavily played at threes,
he made all the running, and was only
collared and beaten out the last fifty
yards by Earl Cochran, a 12 to 1 shot rid
den by H. Brown. Montallade, the 2to 1
choice, badly interfered with throughout
the running, was a good third.
It was only through Coady's good rid
ing that Midas, the lukewarm choice for
the final six-iurlont; sprint, was enabled
to capture the purse. Coming through
next the rail in the stretch, the bay horse
won driving, a length in front of Fortu
nata, rather weakiy ridden by Ames.

There will be no racing at Emeryville

THAT "DOCTORED" BEANDY.
The Position of Colonel IrUh Approved
by the Manufaciurerii.
The Manufacturers* ami Producers' As
sociation have taken up the matter of the
adulterated brandy that it. is feared will be
shipped to Europe in spite of the vigorous
protest of John P. Irish. It has been the
richt of this body to enforce the pure foods
laws locally and to prevent "doctorci"
products of the State from being sent
abroad, especially wiih the name of Cali
fornia attached thereunto. Tne stand of
Irish was approved, as shown by tne fol
lowing letter sent to him yesterdas :
May 19, 1897.
Hon. John P. Irish, United States Custom
house, Cityâ Dear .Sir: We were exceedingly
pleased lo hear the report of your vigorous
protest ngainst the exportation of the adul
terated brandy referred to iv an article in tne
San Francisco Chronicle of this date.
Your action in the matter is to us but an
other proof of the fact that California has pub
lic officials who unflinchingly oppose any en
deavors by unscrupulous persons to injure the
reputation of her pro l nets.
We hereby desire to extend to you our appre
ciation of your watchfulness and zeal in work
ing for the interest ol tho Stale, as well as as
sure you of the assistance and support of our
association in your endeavor to protect the
public and benefit the State. We beg to re
main yours very truly,
James W. Kkrr, President,
Deputy Collector Tobin yesterday after
noon signed a permit for tne shipment of
the stuff, but Colonel Irish refused to give
a permit on the ground that the Federal
statute does not ailow blending in the
manufacturing bonded warehouse.
Thomas D. Riordan, attorney for the
warehouse people, said that there was no
statute prohibiting blending and that on
Collector Wise's permit the "brandy"
wou'd be shipped by rail to New Yorlr.
and thence to England.
Damages for Pernonal lujurien.
Two suits lor damages by street railway acci
dents were filed in the Superior Court, yester

ASNTJAL MEETING OF THE
ASSOCIATION.
What Has Been Done in Three Years
Efforts to Create a College
of Commerce.
The third annual meeting of the Mer
chants' Association was held in Academy
of Sciences Hall last evening, and a new
board of directors was elecied. It was
larsrely attended, for an invitation bad
Deen extended to tne general public as
well as to the members. The work of the
association lor the past year was reviewed,
and plans of proposed improvements were
outlined.
F. W. Dohrmann, the president, opened
the meeting with a few remarks, which
Were followed by the reading of the an
nual report ol the director?, which was in
substance as follows:
To-night closes the third year in the exist
ence of the Merchants Association. In the
history of a' city three years are Dut a brief
span. *In the active life of this association,
however, many events have transpired. It is
only possible within the limited scope of this
report to recount briefly the most important
results accomplished during the past year and
allude to the work now progressing or pro
posed in the near luture.
Tnree years aeo '.he Merchants' Association
began its career with but iorty-seveu public
spirited rit.zeus. Two years ago the roll num
bered 40G hj.uics. To-day 867 business firms
are enrolled ns regular members of the asso
ciation. Kvery iudusiry in the City is repre
sented. 'Ihe outstanding dues on tne htof
this month amounted to $1340. The amount
of cash on band was $740 i*l, maKing a sur
plus to the credit of the association on May 1,
1897, of $2080 21.
The comparatively clenn streets and side
walk* ot toduy, as compared with their filthy
condition three years ago, fully confirms tne
pracical efficiency of the specifications pre
pared by this association and twice adopted
by tne municipality. With the introduction
of better pavements still more favorable re
su'ts will be attained.
We regret u> report that our earnest efforts
in favo. of street-spriukiing by the municipal
ity, as in other cities, have not yet met with
success. Partial sprinkling is, however, se
cured under the present street-cleaning speci
ficaiions. Your board will continue its efforts
in navine the City authorities perform the
just municipal duty of street-sprinkling.' As
a valuable fertilizer street-sweepings have
long beeu recognized In many cities. The re
cent experiment ol using the weepings of our.
streets for this . purpose proved so in
vigorating to the growing plants in
Golden Gate Park, that aminta-ments satisfac
tory to Ihe Park Commissioners and to the
Market-street Railway Company were under
way, whereby it was hoped this experiment
would become a permanent feature ot the City.
Unlortunavely the recent decision of the At
torney-General, declaring the hauling of street
sweepings us beyond the legal power of the
street, iainvay company, Has interrupted our
p;ans in this direction and will deiay their
iiiiineiit until otner arraugemonts may De
effected for the transportation of the street
sweepings to Goiden Gate Park. .
The cobbles that have so long disfigured
many of the principal streets in the neurt of
the iiy, are at lam disappearing. The effort
of this association in connection with the City
and property-owners have resulted iv final
arrangements ior the modern repavement of
several blocks on Stcc* ton and on Geary
streets. The repavement of a number of other
blocks wnl shortly begin.
Your board oi direerors consented to under
take tne experiment of showing the advan
tages of lighting the principal streets ot me
City with powerful electiic arc lights. Two
hundred and twenty-eight arc lights are now
suspended along seven y-two blocks through
out the City. The entire expense of this ex
periment in better street lighting has been
voluntarily borne by the merchmits and prop
erty-owners Along me streets illumiuateu. It
is now proposed o secure a readjustment of
the gas and electric lights, so tca>. the better
illumination of the streets may be aecom
plisned by the City at a very slight increase
over ttie present cost. A carefully prepared
piun for effecting this desirab.e result will be
submitted to-night.
Tne progress oi a city Is often judged by
things that appear trivial. The absence of
the little sign-guUies giving the >ames of
streeis is a frequent cause of annoyance, espe
cially to ylsitois to our (Jity. A detaued list
oi all missing signs has been furnist.ed to thu
Superintendent ot Streets, with a request that
the ordinance of the City requiring these sign*
at street corners be fully enforced.
The partial report made â¢ by the official en
gineers in 1892 shows conclusively that the
pieseut defective drainage of >he City de
mands radical improvement. Many of the
sewers are in sucn a dilapidated condition
that more patchwork is really a waste of pub
lic lunds. Your board believes that a thor
ough and scientific construction of a perfected
sewer system is imperative. Your board,
therefore, has recommended the appointment
of a commission of reliable engineers to com
plete the work begun by the previous Sewer
age Commission. Based upon such a report
the City authorities couldsa:cly pioceed to de
vice \vÂ»js and means for the early construc
tion of a correct sewer system, mat may also
contain conduits for all the wires thnt now
disfigure the streets. . The citizens of San
Francisco would then, no doubt, be willing to
vote for thÂ« issuance of sufficient municipal
bonds for the consummation of this much
needed improvement. â  ...
The experienc â  01 other cities as well as the
experiments upon our streets, clearly prove
that a more liberal policy should be adopted
by Sau Francisco Is street pavements. The
custom in vogue of excluding certain desira
ble paving materials should be changed. No
good reason appears to exist lor the absolute
exclusion of asplialt, wood and brick from
competition in ihe street pavemeuu of San
Francisco. Specifications lor tue use of the^e
matt-rials under maintenance guaranteed of
at leas: live years have been carefully pre
pared by ihe engineer of this association and
recommended o the Board of Supervisors for
incorporation in future contracts for street
pavements. The queÃiion of ascertaining the
materials best suited for street pavements in
San Francisco js all the more urgent in view
of the contemplated repavetnent of Market
street at ai early date. The proper repave
ment of this main artery ol the City will
largely determine the character ol the pave
ments up<in the many streets tributary to it.
Witn a modern pavement there U nardiy an
other slice i in the world that would present
a more imposing Appearance than this mag
nificent thoroughfare.
A special committee of twenty-five promi
nent citizens was appointed by your board of
directors to secure a suitable situ for the Wi.
merding School of Industrial Aris. Confer
ences have been held witn a committee of the
board of regents of the university of Califor
nia and a number of available sites have bj'eu
offered. The regents of the University are
now deliberating upon the selection of one of
these sites, and it is hoped that the boys of
California will soon enjoy the beneficence of J.
Clute Wilmerding, one of the noble pioneer
merchants of San Francisco.
The continued depression In all lines of
business makes ihe strictest economy neces
sary in public as well as in private affairs.
Ihe ouerous burden of taxation must be les
sened as much as possible. An annual ex
penditure of from $5,000,000 to $6,000,000
for the .simple maintenance and operation of
tnis City government la altogether exorbitant.
In the report submitted last year to the Board
of Supervisors by me Merchants' Association
it was clearly shmvn that upon a total valua
tion of $350,000,000 the City government
could be properly mid efficiently operated
upon a levy of $1 upon the $100 assessed valu
ation. With this end In view another report
will be prepared and submitted to the Board
of Supervisors before the l*Â»vy for the next
fiscal year is made.. Renewed efforts will also
be made to prevent a repetition this year of
any unjust increase by the State Board of
Equalization in the assessed valuatiou or
property in San Francisco.
The absolute necessity of a new organic law
for San Francisco becomes more potent every
day. The utter lack of method and responsi
bility in the present consolidation act has
caused coniusion and uncertainty. Under
such unfavorable conditions it is well nigh
impossible for the City to go ahead. Not only
dots this defective municipal structure per
mit lavish expenditure of the public funds,
but it also stands as a bar to the construction
of nedessary public improvements. At trie
last meeting of the Citizans' Charter Associa
tion the president of that organization, Mayor
James D. Ptielan, was empowered by unani
mous resolution to appoint a committee of
100 citizens, representing all classes in the
community, to prepare a new charter for Snn
Francisco. We sincerely hope and believe
that the wise selection of this representative
committee will result in the early preparation
Of a model charter that will win the hearty
support of every citizen having at heart the
weliareofthe City. With a modern organic
law to direct her course aright, and under the
benificent influences of the new primary elec
tion law, Stin Francisco will at last be enabled
to take her just place among the most progres
sive cities 01 the world.
In concluding this annual address, your
board desires to congratulate tbe citizens of
San Francisco upon their recent awakening to
the vital importance 01 taking greater interest
iv municipal affairs. The commendable ef
forts of the present Mayor and Board of Super
visors to bring about measures of economy
and reform in ihe administration of the City
government deserve the encouragement of
the people ana the co-operation of every civic
organization. The only hope for the iuture 01
our community rests in the civic pride or our
people. Once let the spirit of civic patriotism
be thoroughly aroused and no barrier can
stay the irresistible power of relorm.
This was followed by a report of the
committee selected to nominate the board
of directors lor the ensuing year. The
fi'teen names presented were: A. 8.
Baldwin, Joseoh iJritton, Charles Bund
schti, James S."Conwell, F.W. Dohrmann,
A. Fusenot, Hugo D. Keil, Daniel V.
Kelly. Herbert E. Law, Alexander McCord,
Henry Michaels, John E. Quinn, Hugo
Kothscliild, W. li. fcherwood and Vander
lynn Mow. The gentlemen selected were
elected unanimously.
The retiring board presented an inter
esting plan for the lighting of the City by
electricity instead of by gas. President
Dohrmann explained that it was not the
idea to secure a perfect system at once,
but that the plan suggested would be a
great improvement on the one now in
I operation. In substance the improve
ments to be worked for were as follows:
In order to make a beginning in the im
provement of our system of lighting, the
board ol directors pr-sents the following plan
fur tne better lighting of our principal tnor
oughfares during the nextfiacai year, w'tli the
belief that a year's triui will lead to its exten
sion throughout the city. The leading prin
ciple of tnis system, with a few exceptions, is
that of suspending an arc light in the center.
of eRCh crossing of all the business streets of
the City and dispensing with adjacent pas
lamps which will thereby be rendered, unnec
essary.
In Hdditlon to'the regular business streets It
Is also proposed to place electric lights at each
crossing on Golden Gate avenU", from Market
street to Devisadero, and on Folsom as fur out
as Nineteenth street, from Nineteenth street
to Twenty-sixth being already lighted in this
manner. It seems very desirable that one
main thoroughfare to the pirk should h* well
lighted, anil in order that . qual facilities may
be afforded the Mission residents it is proposed
to include their boulevard in the same system.
Upon ihe main business streets south of
Market, such as Third, Fourtn. Fifth, Sixth
and Ninth, and Sixteenth street in the Mis
sion, where the block", are double the length
of those north of Market, it is proposed to
place a light in the middie of the bock in ad
dition to those on the crossings. It is pro
posed to suspend over the center or Market
street a uuiform line of lights reaching fioin
the ferries to Valencia Btreet These lights
are to be placed Â»s follows : From East to First
streets, the blocks being 275 i eet long on the
south side, a light will be suspended opposite
the intersection of each of the streets south of
Market.
On the succeeding blocks, which are 825
feet long, mere will be two additional lights
between intersections, and, 'on the 550-foot
blocks one additional light to each block.
This will require thirty-live lights, all about
300 feet apart. In order to do away with ttie
unsightly appearance of the usual lot of wires
I and ropes required to haul' the lumps to the
! eldu of the street to be trimmed it is proposed
to suspend these lights from small wire cables
stretched from the side of the streets, and the
wires conducting the electricity are to be io
closed in conduits and lastened close against
the cable. All ropes will be dispensed with
and the lamp trimmed irom (he center of the
street â¢ 1 -;"
The districts to be lighted are as follows:
Market street, irom Kast to Valencia; the
business streets south ol Market, from Third
to Ninth; Valencia, from Fiiteenth to Twenty
third; Mission, from First to Ninth and from
Fifteenth to Twenty-filth; Folsom, lroru Third
to Nineteenth; .Sixteenth, from Guerrero to
Folsom ; Devisadero, from California to Oak;
more, from Geary to Wa-hiugtou; Ualon,
irom Octaria to Buchanan; Polls, from Suiter
to Vallejo; Larkln, Irom McAllister to Sutler;
Pacific, from Jones to Hyde; Goiden Gate
'avenue, from Market to Devisadero; Hayes,
from Market to Laguna; Lnguna. from Fell to
Golden Gate avenue; the retail district north
of Market and east of Taylor, including the
retail portions of 'Montgomery avenue, Stock
ton and Dupont streets, together witn several
other blocks in sundry localities.
The cost of this system of lighting will be ns
follows: On all the streets north of Market
and in the Western Addition, as well as on the
greater portion of the streets south of Market,
each electric light will displace four gas
lamps. Taking the figures of the present con
tract with the City, these four gas. lamps will
cost 43 cents per night and the electric light
55 cents pc- night, the difference in cost thus
being only 7 cents per nighi fjr saeh electric
light. Cost of 281 electric lients at 55 cents
per night, $154 55; increase in cost of electric
lights per night, $'.29 51; costof 1042 lamps
12 cents per night, $125 04: or $796 77 pir
month of twenty-seven days, or $9561 24 per
year.
We are sntisfled, however, that if the electric
lamps were lighted every night during the
year the r*te per lamp at present chiirged
could be sufficiently reducod so that tne total
cost of the proposed system would come within
the estimate above calculated upon the basis
of a moonlight schedule.
The president stated that the Supervis
ors will be asked to make provision in the
next tax levy to put into op -ration this
improved system of street lighting. A
resoiuiion to this effect was passed by the
meeting.
This finished the regular business of the
meeting and the remainder of the session
was devoted to addresses upon the pro
posed college of commerce.
Arthur Rodgers, regent of the Uni
versity of California, who introduced a
resolution before the Board of Regents to
add to â¢ the university a college of com
merce, delivered an interesting address
upon his DBt theme. '
A. A. Watkins, president of the City
Board of Trade, also suoke upon the same
subject.

KAHN WAS PAID
FOR LOBBYING
Tka University Regents
Allowed Him the Sum
of $1250
Treasurer Louis Sloss Paid the
Money and Took Julius
Kahn's Receipt.
Governor Bndd on May 14 Signed the
Check to Cover the Advance
AutLotiz d by the Regents.
It may be a long time before the Univer
sity Regents hear the last of the allowance
of $1250 to Julius Kahn for services ren
dered at Sacramento during the recent
session of the Legislature. No one who
was there can call to mind that Kahn per
formed any service for the regents.
Yesterday a reporter of The Call asked
Major Mhoon. attorney for tae regents, if
be knew what legal service Mr. Kabn had
performed for the board, and he replied
that he was not inioimed as to the service
Mr. Kahn rendered.
"Did he assist you in any cases for the
Board of Regents?" asked the reporter.
"No, he did not assist me," replied
Major Mhoon.
Inquiry has disclosed the fact that the
Kuhn allowance was paid from the current
expense fund of the university. The de
mand therefore was not presented to the
State Board of Examiners for approval.
Here is how the money was paid:
The finance committee of th c regents, of
wh eh A. S. HaLi lie is en airman, autuor
izi d Loi'is S-loss. the treasurer, to advance
the sum nam- dto Juaus Kaun. This ac
tion ol inn finance commiuee was :*ubse
quently approved by the regents in o en
ession, a maj rity of tie member* voting
on the appropriation. Governor Bud i was
n> t in the room Â« hen the roll was culled
j on the finance committee's report at the
j last meeting, but be'ore he left :he session
1 he said he was opt oied to the allowance of
; thai money .10 Mr. Kahn. Speaker Frank
i L. Coombs voted in the negative on tne
| call of the roll.
The fact is now established fian the
sum of $1250 was advanced to .luliu- Kami
by Louis ISloss, treasurer, on ihe order of
the finance committ?e. Mr. Slosa ex
plained yesterday that he hid no discre
tionary power in the premises. He was
ordered by the regents in accordance with
the prescribed methods of disbursing the
f unus of the unive-sity to pay tins amoilnt,
and he accordingly paid the money, tak
ing X inn's receipt therefor.
W ben the treasurer makes an advance
of this kind he receives a :ew days later a
check signed by the president and secre
tary of ihe Board of Regents, to cover the
amount advanced. This check is made pay
able to the treasurer.
Whatever Governor Budd's views may
have been on Tuesday, May 11, when the
regents held their last meeting, it is cer
tain that he aporoved, as president of the
b.jard, the advance to Kahn as early as
May 14. Louis Slos?, treasurer, holds a
check dated May 12, 1897, duly signed by
James H. Buad and me secretary of the
bo rd for the amount advanced to Kahn.
The Call requested mat one of its
aruais be permitted to make a tracing of
tnis check bearing the Governor's signa
ture, so that a fac-simiie could be pre
sented, but the treasurer held that the
paper was the property of the regents and
its reproduction could not oe allowed with
out the consent of the finanse com nn lee
of the Board of Regents.
Among the regents themselves there is
a disinclination to ta.k about the matter.
Several of them admit in private conver
sation that a mistake was made in
authorizing any outsider to lobby at Sac
ramento. When the Rev. Dr. Bonte was
secretary of the board, he went to Sacra
mento as occa>ion required and kept the
board informed regarding the various bills
introduced. Aft^r his death it was thought
advisable to have a man on the lookout,
and Regent K>-in stein's influence caused
the appointment of Julius Kahn.
Members of the Legislature assert that
Kahn did not do anything to promote the
passage of the bill allowing th â¢ university
an additional tax levy 01 1 cent. There
were graduate* of the university in the
S.-nate and Assembly, and they were so
eager to obtain credit for serving the
college that quite a rivairy sprang up
among tt:eni. Assemb.ynian Wright o-f
Alameda guided the bill in the Assembly
and Senator Stratton of the same county
rushed it through the Senate.
The payment o! $1250 to Julius Kahn is
likely to cause an ugly scandal which may
be thoroughly investigated at the next
session of the Legislature.
Governor Budd said last night that he
was compelk-d to sien the check to cover
the amount paid to Kahn. As president
of the board hia function was only cleri

MAY STILL VOTE
The Convention Discusses
the Words "Male' :
and "Person."
Rev. Dr. Wakc-fbld Makes an
Earnest Plea ior Hs "Sis
ters in Christ."
It Is Decided That the Dio:ese Must
Have an Arcbdeaconâ The
S?ssion ACjourns.
"Shall wp set our feet upon the necks of
our sisters? I am drawing near the other
â¢world, but the closer I come to its boun
daries the more strongly do I believe in
giving the most loyal, devout and ardent
members of our church their due share of
repre-entation."
It was at the Episcopal convention yes
terday morning that the venerable Dr. J.
}). Wakerield, D.D. ?of San Jose made this
, p!ea for his "sisters in Chriat." Rev. R.
_\ Foute, reporting for the committee on
.:auons, had }ust proposed that in the
amendments to canons the word "male"
should be substituted for the word, ''per
son" in describing those entitled to vote
for vestrymen.
No sooner was the question before ihe
house for discussion than Dr. Wakerield
took the platform and registered an em
phatic protest against it. He spoke in
earnest language of women as the
church's most laithful adherents, and
said he wished the day wou'd come when
the Episcopal diocese of California could
see the way clear to eive them a wider
voice in church matters.
The feeling of the convention on the
question was quickly shown by the ap
plause with which Rev. Dr. Wakefield'e
remarks were greeted.
Vincent Neale of San Rafael, who foi
-1 owed the venerable clergyman, charac
terized as das'ardly any serious attempt
to rob the women of their vote. Continu
ing he said:
"It was the overwhelming vote of the
liquor dealers that killed the suffrage
amendment in this State at the last elec
tion. Shall the Episcopal Conference put
itself on record as following in the foot
steps of the liquor-dealers? For $,vo years
women bave uad the right of voting for
vestrymen; they have exercised their
privilege judiciously and well. It would
be llloeical and dastardly to rob them of
the right of votine, and I, for one, protest
vigorously against any such motion."
Rev. Dr. Spalding spoke in warm praise
of the woik women had done in his own
vestry elections.
'Women raise most of the funds of the
church," he said, "and I believe that those
â who raise money should have a voice in
the spending of it."
No one spoke in favor of substituting
the word "male" in the proposed amend
ment of section 140 of the canons. Rev.
John A. Emery proposed an amendment
leavinc intact the word "person" but
n<akinsj some slight modifications with re
e^ra to t.ne qualifications of would-be
voters, as communicants and contributing
members. Mr. Emery's amendment was
adopted.
In this connection it may be stated that
among the lay delegates to the conven
tion, which adjourned yesterday, were ten
women, :ianiely: Mrs. A. C. Maude o.'
Baker?ne:d, Mrs. S. M. Willis and Mrs. N.
D. Bleeker of SeJma, Mrs. Helen M.
ol Tulare. Mrs. J. G. Knoi, Mrs.
W. W. Cross and M;s. W. P. Tnonifis of
Visa:ia; Mrs. J. E. Hutcbinson, Mrs.
Henry O'Neil and Miss Alice Caldwell of
â \Yamut Creek. The=e ladies, however,
' did not answer to the rollcall or attempt
to vote. In consequence the right of
women to sit in the convention nad no
chance of being discussed this year.
The chief work of yesterday morning's
session was the dis-cussion of proposed
amendments to the canons. The most im
portant amendment adopted was one
which decrees that elections for vestry
men shall take place at Advent instead of
Easter, commencing with Advent, 1898.
This change will necessitate changing the
time or year of the annual election, but
ye H. Hcok, assistant secretary,
fiated that lay members from the couatry
could ieave their business with more fa
c lay- in winter than in early summer,
when crops are just beginning to lipen.
Considerable imcussion was held over
an amendment offered by the committee
on legislation to conform tne canons to
the new law. The debate was whether
the rector should beex-otticio a member of
the board or trustees, directors and ves
tries. The canon -was finally allowed to
stand, permitting rectors to be members
of the different vestries.
The afternoon session began with the
discuss:on and adoption ol resolutions
v.ith regard to an archdeacon for the dio
cese. Hitherto the dioceÂ«e has had no
archdeacon and iateiy the Bishop has had
more worK than he could perform. The
arcbdeacon will be appointed by the
jjishop, but the appointment will not be
made immediately. It was resolved that
alter January 1, lS&s, the archdeacon shall
not be rector ot a parish while in office.
On the recommendation of the finance
comruiuee the archdeacon's salary was
rixed at fISOO per annum.
Rev. Dr. Spalding, reporting for the
â  'inmittee on special collections, advised
â  ths following:
"This diocese cannot recognize any
charities not recognized by the conven
tion."
After it had been explained that this did
not debar individual churches from re
cognizing any charities they etiose, the
motion was carried. The following chari
ties' were recognized as diocesan: The
Episcopal Old Ladies' Home, the Maria
Kip Orphanage, the Arnntage Home,
fund for the care of the widows and or
phans of the clergy, general fund for dis
abled clergy, church building fund and
domestic and foreign missions.
There was considerable discussion as to
whether St. Luke's Hospital could be in
cluded in the li3t. The Bishop pointed
out that St. Luke's is struggling to main
uin free beds, but the general impression j
eemed to be that the hospital has tool
much the aspect of a money-making insti- I
: u:ion to Le regarded as a diocesan
rnanty and it was accordingly omitted
irora the list.
The following board of missions was
elected: Rev. John A. Emery, Rev. F. J.
Maynard, Dean W. H. Moreland, Dean C.
0. TiHotson, Dean William Lucas, Rev.
Robert Ritchie, G. H. Kellogg, Coionei i.
J>. V. MidiJleton, M.D., William A. M.
Van Bcltkelen, Dr. H. C. Davis and C. D.
Haven.
It was resolved that the delegates to ihe
Missionary Council be a .committee to
co-operate with the Bishop in regard to
the gener.il miÂ»sionary fund.
A collection was taken up to pay off the
indebtedness of the new church at Rands
burg, and Theodore Pinther, representing
the Hellenic Christian Society, was given
tne privilege of the floor, and made an
appeal "'For those suffering for the cause
of Christianity in Greece."
Bishop Nichi.ls* intention of visiting the
coming Lambeth Conference was an
nounced, and, after passine a number of
votes of thanks the convention adjourned
sine die. In a few closing remarks Bishop
Nichols said:
"J believe w* have touched a high-tide
mark. For many a year the work of this
convention will live in the progress of the
church of Christ."
DANGEROUS MILLS.
Fire Marshal Towe Wants Them 'Re
moved, With Carpet-Beaters, to
More Isolated Districts.
Fire Marshal Towe is opposed to shoddy
mills as well as carpet-beating establish
ments being allowed lo remain in the
thickly populated districts of the City,
and hearing of the proposed action of the
Health Department to remove the latter
has addressed the following letter to the
board:
By the daily press of this City I find you are
ab><ut to sci apart by ordinance a ceriain dis
trict in which carpet-beatiug establishments
may conduct bnsi e*s, and in no other.
It is a good move from a sanitary as well as
a fire standpoint, but 1 desire tocallyourat
tention at this time, so that they may be in
cluded, to shoddy mills and pickers. All such
places should be constructed of bricit even in
the proposed district, as they are dangerous
on account of tire as well as a menace to
health.
Snoddy mills are extremely dangerous to
healthâ and I am sure you will bear me out if
you will cause their methods to be investi
gatedâ on account of the filthy rags tbat go to
the mills to be picked and afterward made
into cheap furniture. Besides, the pickers are
constantly striking buttons on siones, causing
sparks which frequently start a conflagration.
The filthy dust wnich is constantly arising is
blown into neighboring residences and scat
ters the terms pi disease contained in the rags.
I trust you will give these places your atten
tion at t n is time, and hope you will include
them in your proposed order for the safety of
the City.
STOPPED ON THE PLY.
Why a SSOOO Taynient Did Not Go to
Puget bound.
The case of Samuel Montagu Com
pany of London, England, against the
Pacific Bank and its directors was argued
and submitted to United States District
Judge Morrow. The plaintiff cabled the
bank in June, 1893, to telegraph $5000 to
the Puget Sound National Bank, that sum
having been deposited by the plaintiff
with the National Bank of Commerce in
New York City to the credit of the Pacific
Bank. The Pacific Bank did not comply
with the request, and failed a day or two
after it received the money.
The defense was that the $5000 was an
ordinary deposit, just as was $3902, the
open account of tne Montagu Company,
and that the plaintiff was entitled to only
a proportion according to the ratio al
lowed the remainder of the depositors. It
was set up also that the Pacific Bank did
not receive a confirmation of the authen
ticity of the telegram until after the
failure.
The company's attorneys contended
that the $5000 was not tendered the bank
as a deposit, but that it was sent to be for
warded to Puget Sound, and that the Fa
citic Bank was employed merely as an
agent in the matter; also, that it had
been the custom of the defendant not to
wait for confirmation ol such telegraphic
advices.
THE JOKE ON THE JOKER.
How W. H Ttbin Escaped the
Canine Results of an
Advertisement.
Do:rs Were Brought b7 the Score, but
F. rtunately for Kirn He
Had Mov d.
W. H. Tobin of 43 Belvidere street is
thanking his lucky stars that be moved
wnen he did, and is enjoying a good laugh
at the expense of some friend who L&s a
penchant for practical jokes and who
tried to have some fun with him.
Up to a few days ago Tobin lived at 36
Bsividere street, almost directly opposite
to his present place of residence, but find
ing a more suitable house in No. 43 shifted
his household belongings to that location.
The practical joker, not knowing of the
change of residence, inserted an adver
tisement in a morning paper requesting
that those who had small nouse-broken
pet dogs for tale call at 3H Belvidere
street and secure a profitable bargain.
The next morning when Mrs. Tobin
looked out of the window to catch a
glimpse of the morning sun she found the
street full of men with dogs and more ar
riving with assorted canint s every mo
ment. Tnere were long men leading
dachhunds, men with greyhounds,
men with big dogs and others with small
ones, and all heading for No. 36.
The front steps of the bouse were
crowded with men with their yelping
wares, and ihe bell was in a state of col
lapse. Mrs. Tobin called her husoand
and both watched the growing mob of
dog venders as it arrived hopefully, grew
impatient, then wrathful, finally despond
ent and then melted away. Of course
there was no response to the ringing of
tbe beil because the bouse was tenantless,
and though it took some time for the dis
appointed respondents to the advertise
ment to become convinced of this face,
they eventually did, and after talking in
terms too strong for publication o; the
character of a person who would delude
poor people in that wav, left in distrust.
One angry man, who carried a mangy
nondescript under his arm, threw a stone
through a window as lie went down the
street, remarking that he had got some
satisfaction after all.
The Tobins did not know until some
one showed them the advertisement that
the crowd of men and dogs was the result
of an attempt to play a practical joke on
them. Mr. Tobin is the bath and iaundry
inspector of tbe Health Department.
SAN LUIS OBISPO BONDS.
An Interesting Decision Rendered by
the State Supreme Court.
An interesting opinion was rendered
yesterday in the case of P. W. Murphy
against toe city of San Luis Obispo and
officers thereof. It was an action brought
to injoin the defendants from selling or
disposing of certain bonds issued but
not sold by the city and to res. rain tbe
defendants from levying the taxes men
tioned in the complaint and trorn en
forcing a certain ordinance. The case
was tried by the lower court and judg
ment given for tbe defendants. Murphy
presented three grounds of attack upon
the bonds in question.
First, that the bonds were male payable
in "goid coin of the United States," in-
I stead of 'gold coin or lawful money of
the United States." Second, that the
question whether the interest on the
bonds would be paid annually or Â«emi
annuaily was not submitted to the voiers
and, third, that the method of voting was
irregular. As to tne first point the
Supreme Court holds that the bonds are
in conformity with tbe ordinance and
the notice of election. The same tribunal
holds that tbe second point has no
merit. They decide that the form of
votingâ tne third pointâ was a little ir
regular, but that a new trial could avail
nothing. Upon the whole the Supreme
Coun ordered that the judgment of the
lower court be reversed, and that judg
ment be entered for the plaintiff as
prayed for in tbe complaint.

A Grand Parade of the Winners Will

bition, and with few exceptions the own- I
ers of the dogs benched in the Pavilion
admitted tnat they were peilectly satisfied
with the awards.
Judges Of dog shOW 3 have Standards of <
their own to go by, and the dog that may j
be classed as perfect by one of the experts !
would, in the eye* of another supreme
ruler, be considered only a very ordinary
<;nprimÂ«>n nf th<Â» hrppri it ronrpopnti
specimen ot me Dreea it represents. â¢
Therefore it Stands to reason that dog
shows will never give general satisfaction i
to the breeders, the majority of whom
to tne oreeaers, me majority 01 wnom
raise dogs Jor marketable purposes only.
Another peculiar feature of dot; shows
is that pointers, setters and greyhounds
that have won winning colors at bench
shows have seldom achieved any distinc-
tion in the field. Of course there have
been seme exceptions, but generally
speaking field-trial winners have been
beaten on the bench by dogs that would
not be owned by sportsmen.
The bench shows are good, however, for
The purpose of educating people to love j
and prize high-ciass dogs which carry â 
pedigrees that will extend as far as some

be may be as liomeiy as a jackal, is
nevertneless a very valuable animal and
generally commands a high price.

are some of the most ugly arjpearing i

But then a dog show is fashionable and j
the most fashionable of the kind ever held I
tnissideot tno Die mountains is now in J
full swing in Mechanics' Pavilion. j
It is amusing to watch the d umbers of i
alleged experts on dogfle.b at tte.show \
handling dogs in the benches that will, of |
course, permit, of being handled, and then j
hear the opinions exchanged, to wit:
"Look at that head! It has the intelli-

BROACHED THE
DIRIGO'S CARGO
Four of the Crew Tapped
a Barrel of Old
Whisky.
And Captain Goodwin Propcsss
That Its Value Must
Be Paid.
Mate E wall Arrested for B;atinÂ» a
Sailor on the High Sea. â A
Lively Voyage.
Captain Goodwin of the American ship
Dirigo was tbe center of an excited group
of sailors yesterday in tbe office of the
Shipping Commissioner. It had been an
nounced that the seamen's wages would
be paid at 11 o'clock, bat the captain put
in a claim against four of the sailors for
some whisky that had been broached from
the cargo and payment was postponed un
til 11 o'clock this morning.
The sailors were indignant over the
matter and accused the captain of having
broached cargo himself and of having ap
propriated iron stanchions and other
thines. The enptain replied that the
cargo was his and that |he paid for what
ever might have been missing. Finally
Robinson, the leader of the crew, re
marked that the captain wasn't fit to com
mand a clam scow and the captain ap
pealed to the Commissioner to protect
him from further insult. The men were
ordered out of the office and related their
grievances in the corridor.
Robinson admitted that he and three
others bored a hole with a gimlet into a
cask of whisky and took four pannikins
out of the barrel â not more than a quart
all told, which they were willing to pay
for, but they objected to being required to
pay for the whole barrel. They denied
that they had taken more than a quart or
that tuey had rerilled the barrel with
water.
Captain Goodwin sent for a ganger, and
the capacity of the "four panuikins" will
be iearnud to-day.
The Diri?o had hard Inck on the voyage
out from New York. She arrived here
last Monday, and had been so long over
due that reinsurance was paid on her.
The mate, C. S. Elwell, gave himself up
to the authorities yesterday, a warrant
having been issued for bis arrest on a
charge of battery preferred by George \V.
Tyson, and his examination will be had
before United States Commissioner Hea
cock at half-past 10 o'clock next Monday
morninc.
The sailors say that Elwell caught Cap
tain Goodwin by the throat in the course
of a dispute between them and that the
mate was punished by being locked np in
his room for thjee weeks.

rigging to the deck. He died from his in
juries four days afterward.
It is likely that the men who broached
tbe cargo will be prosecuted and severely
pr.nished, as the offense is a serious onÃ
under the United States statutes.

The Bureau of statistics at Washington has pub
lishea the returns of the foreign commerce of the
United States for the calendar year 1896- The
rigures show tha: the pxcess of exports of mer
chandise from this country over the imports for
ihnt period amounted to the enormous sum of
$325,322,184. This breaks ihe record of this
country's excess of exports over imports. The
year that came nearest to \. was 1878. when the
excess of exports over imports was $30.\279,590.
Coming at the same time, with other conditions
analogous to those obtaining in early days at the
time of prosperity that began in 879, the figures

during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; igo- I
therms, or dotted lines, equal tempi-rature. The j
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usur.lly accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Wasblngtoo
coast. When the pressure is high Id the interior
and low along the coasi, and the Isobars extend
north and south alon? the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low-" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb- I
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and '
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 21, 1897.
furnished by E. A. Bresse, Produce Exchange
grainbroker. 412 Pine street.
San Fbancisco, May 20, 1897.
Chicago.
Wheat started this morning fractionally lower
than yesterday's closing quotations. J Karly cables
were Vid higher: French inarnets stroneer. Prices
held steatiy around opening quotations for the
first hour of the session. A stronger feeling came
Into the market .on reports of rust damage to
wheat in Hungary and Austria. Shorts began
covering: this advanced July to 71% c. selling
again became creater than buyers cared to take,
resulting in a decliue to 71 1/4 c.
About thli tim>Â» New Yors and Boston reported
large export engagements. This news again
started good buying and advanced July to 71%Â®
72c Selling by longs to take profits near the
c.ose weakened prices iractioDa ly. 71 /ic was
bid when the song sounded.
The market has been hammered bard by shorts
during the past few days. This has resulted in au
overso d condition. The greater part of buying to
day was by shor;s. There was 1 very little outside
interest shown. The bear clique who have been
so prominent In the market of late were not try
ing to prevent prices from advancing. The mar
ket is becoming very much professional.
Si. Loui* wired later in the day that the Hessian
fly was doing more damage in Missouri than at
first thoi'ghl. This is the same old fly speculators
use every year when they run short of news. The
sections whence these reports originate are not
buying wheat. This is the best evideuce that no
serious damage is being done. It serves to ad
vance nn oversold markat. uther than this no im
portance should be attached to the fly problem.

Receipts to-dÂ»y at primary points 470,763
Shipments to-day at primary points 284.957
Exports. 362,698
Corn rather firmer; receipts lighter. Covering
short sales was about the only feature to the mar
ket.
Oats dull, shade higher.
The provision market excited no great amount
of enthusiasm, packers' and scalpers' trading be
ing the extent of the business.
San Fraucisco.
9:16 a. m, RKssiiiN-.
Wheat opened steady; transactions small.
Crowd not disposed to trade one way or the other.
Some damage reports from the Sacramento Val
ley say hot north winds caused muih harm yes
terday.
Weather conditions to-day cooler. Wheat acts
heavy. December opened and closed at $1 2734.
Nothing doinsr in barley.
10:15 a. if. session.
Wheat opened easier, under 8/ac the closing of
the previous session. Selling uecame general.
Buyers were scarce. December dropped to $1 26 %
besore the buying was sufficient 10 stop the de
cline. Offerings were also slackened on account
of Chicago's strength: tbat market suddenly ue
came stronir, changing sentiment here. A reac
tion to $1 27 followed.
11:16 a if. session.
Wheat trading was fairly a:tive. but Inclined to
weakness. 'Ihere was considerable wheat lor sale
at $1 27. A few sales were made early in the
session at $1 2ti%. The temper of local traders
wus uearlsn. There was tome selling of long
wheat by holders who became timid on account of
bear aggressiveness. Notwithstanding the sudden
weakness in wheat at certain limits the market
received good support.
December barley opened at 75c aud closed at
74 %c.
2 P. M SESSIOX.
The disposition of traders tendec" toward lower
prices for wheat. December opened at $1 26Vs
and there was no change at the close. Bears huvÂ«s
been more aggressive to-day than for some lime
past. They worked hard to force prices lower, but
were met by good buying at the decline, which
caused their retrea .
Shorts have been waiting quietly for an Inning
for a month or more, during which time longs
have been in full control of the market. The
trade seems about evenly livided upon present
surroundings

Unprecedented Growth of the Berkeley
High School.
BERKELEY, CaiÂ», May 20.â Berke-
Jeyans are jubilant over the showing made
by their high school this year. The school
has nine more graduates tban the Oakland
High School, the latter having seventy
three to Berkeley's eighty-two. This, in
view of the difference in population in
favor of Oakland, ia considered a remark
able showing.
In the matter of High School attend*
ance, and also in the number of students
sent to the university, Berkeley has a
unique record, which ahows the effect of
the educational and literary spirit that
prevails in the town. A greater propor
tion of students from ths grammar schools
complete High School courses in Berkeley
than in any other town in California, and
of those who receive diplomas from the j
High School the proportion who enter J
coiiege is also larger.
Last year the Berkeley High School had
nearly fifty representatives in the fresh
man class that entered the State Uni
verÂ»ij T . xhis year, out of the eighty-two
graduates, the number will beeveniareer.
Abopt 75 per cent of the '97 graduates of
the High School will enter the university
next August. *
.' Tne co.lafce town's heavy representation i
in t;ie university classes has a material
aHect upon university interclass politics.
In past years the southern. and Interior
counties have wielded strong inflaence,

OAKLAND, Cal., May 20. â OTce

IN FELONS` CELLS
A Demented Mother Hu
manely Cared For at
the Hospital.
Mrs. Lolz Takes an Aversion
to Her Attractive
Daughter.
-_â¢ . .. -Â±~
She Willingly Consents to Have Her
Little One Taken From Her and
Sent Home.
Oailas d OrricE Sait Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 20. )
The first insane patient to be taken to
the Receiving Hospital under tee decision
rendered by the District Attorney re
cently is Mrs. Anna Lotz, who was broaght
to the hospital by Constable Kocn to-day
Mrs. Lotz is the subject of a very peca
liar hallucination. Her trouble is not at
all of a violent character, but she has a
most unnatural abhorrence of her eldest
daughter, who is but 16 year* of age and is
a very quiet, attractive jsirJ.. The mother
cannot bear tbis girl near her, ana mani
fests the same symptoms when her daugh
ter is around as a person afflicted with
hydrophobia shows toward water.
Mrs. Lotx is also the mother of a little
girl 3 years of age, and wben brought to
the hospital her child was brought with
her. The mother manifested great affec
tion for the little girl, but after a few
hours some of the feeling that she enter
tained toward her older girl showed itseif
in regard to the younger one, and she was
quite willing that it shoula be taken from
her and sent home.
The affl cted woman lives at Temescal
and her husband is employed in Oakland.
His circumstances were not such as to
permit him to keep his wife at home and
he reluctantly permitted her to be taken
to the hospital. Her case marks a new
era in the treatment of the insane in Aia
raeda County. But for the new law the
unfortunate woman would have been
forced to occupy a cell in the County Jail.
In past years much criticism has been
made on the fact that there were no prorer
conveniences at the County Jail for the
retention of prisoners charged with in-an
ity. The; have been asked to
provide suitable quarters, but, owin.s to
the uncertainty oi the standing of luna
tics prior to their commitment, the Sup
ervisors did not fe^l inclined to incur any
such expense. Under the ruling of the
District Attorney they are now free to act,
and Mrs. Lotz, instead of being confined
in a jail with criminals because of her
mental misfortune, is at the Receivinz
Hospital being properly cared for and
under the special charge of an official ap
pointed for the purpose of looking after
the insane.
Mrs. Lstz will be kept in the hospital
for a few days before being taken to the
Commissioners, and the doctors bope that
with a littie rest her caÂ«e can bo cured.
Dr. Stratton says that the humane metnod
of dealing with a suspected lunatic is to
be hiehiy commended compared with the
old style. _^__^__
ENTEEPEISING "SWEEPS."
They Tried a XÂ«w Swindle to "Raise
the Wind."
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 20.â A. Groom
ana W. E. McPhail, chimney-sweepers
from West Oakland, are under arrest here
for a disturbance of the peace of Mrs. John
Gillam, livingon Buena Vista avenue, near

himself into the honse vroing so fsr as to
tear down the paper screen in front of a
grate and insisted upon ti.e cleaning of a
chimney ia wheh there has not been
smoke from a fire in ten years.
The police believe these fellows have
been working their swindle about town
generally. It is known that Frederick

exceedingly pretty and commodious. One of them is that printed above, which
was submitted by D. F. Oliver, an Oakland architect, and has been very favorably

In a few days the Acme Club will move
into their beautiful headquarters in the
new Abrahamson block at Thirteenth and
Clay streets.
The four-story brick block waich has
been erected during the past few months
is being rapidiy tiniahe-J, and the di
rectors are now busily discussing the na
ture of the opening ceremonies. They are
determined to rut up such a programme
aÂ« Â«ri I sive the club a boom all over tbe
coast, and it is possible that three of their
best boxer- 1 will be matched against three
members from different well-known clubs
in the S*ate.
The men who may be put forward on
behalf of the Acmes are Bert Brown,
Charley Tye and Ed Smith, and they are
well known a- amateurs who are able to
present first-class sport against any ami
tears on the const.
As soon as possible the buildings will
be declared open to the public for inspec
tion and a general invitation issued to
view and criticize the club's quarters. The
location is excellent, as it 49 situated in
the heart of the City, within a block of ail
the streetcar lines. The club is confident
that a more commodious and better ar
ranged atnietic home could not be desired.
The spacious gymnasium nearly equals in
size that of the Olympic Club, and is said
to be the best on the coast as regards light
and air. The swimming tank is 45x15 feet,
with a depth of four to eight feet.
The handball court has been made of
eood size because of the growing feeling
in^favor of the sport among the members.
Special attention has been given to its
ventilation and lighting, and it is ex
pected that it will be the best patronized
room in the building.
The social element of the club has not
been neglected, and the first floor has been
set apart for the purpose of providing
comfortable quarters for the members who
delight in billiards and pool. The c!nb is
now somewhat at a disadvantage because
of the preparations to move, but in c
short time the apparatus will be set up in
the new home, where there will be ample
accommodations for all of the members.

908 Broadway, May 20. )
Mrs. William Letts Oliver, 1110 Twelfth
street, Has been delegated to receive tbe
notices of all those who wish to partici
pate in the decorated parade of carriages
next Saturday, on the occasion of tbe
Fabiola derby at the racetrack.
Some of the carriages will be decorated
very elaborately, and many banners will
be woven with satin, the colors of the
Fabiola, blue and white, or of Derby day,
red, or of the Jockey Club, orange and
black.
W. V. Witcher and H. 0. Trowbridge
have been appointed a committee to have
charge of the meet. Leaders in society on
both sides of the bay and from surround
ing towns and cities have already signi
fied their intention to participaje in the
parade for the lenetit of Fabioia.
The young men who figure prominently
in society have constituted themselves
missionaries to arouie interest among all
those having horses and carriages, and
are reporting great success.
The procession will form at 1 o'clock at
Fourteenth and Harrison streets, and, ac
companied by music, will pass through
the principal thoroughfares of the City
and then drive out to the racetrack.
Many ladies ana gentlemen have taken
bundles of tickets to dispose of for the
races, and should the present fine weather
continue there will no doubt be a great
crush at the track. It is the only benefit
Fabiola will receive in the place of the
Siayday fett, which usually produced
several thousand dollars, and tue ladies
are anxious to make the Derby day as
profitable to the institution.
President Williams has arranged for six
first-class races and has provided a good
purse for each. A. that the ladies have
to do is to arouse enthusiasm, dispose of
the tickets and carry home with them the
entire receipts at the sate o: the race
traa on Saturday evening. No attempt
has been made to declare a general holi
day on Derby day, but the town will be
during the middle of the day en fete.
IEOM GLEE TO MOUBNING.
Commencement 2 xerciiei Changed to
Funeral Serrices.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 20.â One of the
most solemn services ever conducted in a
school was the programme substituted to
night at Anderson's Acadamy for the
usual graduation exercises. James Larue,
one of the young men who lost his life by
the wreck ot the Regina, was to have been
a graduate. He passed his examinations
well and was next to the highest on the
list.
The usually gay ceremonies were en
tirely aispensed with and the tall was
draped with black, as was the desk of the
missing graduate. A memorial service
was held and Raymond T. Baker delivered
the valedictory. Ho said:
Verily do the word 3 of holy writ find expres
sion in all the walks oi life, "In the midst of
life we are in death." How forcibly is tbis
quotation ushered upon our classmates when
we are called to a realisation of the fact that
James Buaklrk La rue baa laid doyn bis bur
den on the wayside and surrendered to the
arch enemy of mortalityâ that sickle which
leaves no spear untouched â the reaper of
death. But yesterday all was buoyancy and
hop* in the bright future Wiiich smiled upon
his efforts. To-day the somber weeds of
mourning for a life that is past is all mat
mortaluv can bestow upon the memory of one
who is dear to ail ot us and wnose sudden
flight from this edrthly pilgrimage was not
only a shock to his classmates, but a heart
rending message to his large circle of ac
quaintances who were dearly bound to him by
the strongest ties of friendship.
Brother Larue â for we nave all been broth
era for the past yearâ was especially popular
with his feliow-students. Hewas generous ;in
thought, kind in action and was beloved by
all. He was always alive to every sport wmch
animates the springtime of life, (earless as a
lion and gentle as a lamb among liU com
panions. Thus his kindly natur* endeared
nlm 10 every member of his clas.Â«, and his un
timelr taking off haa rendered the exercises
to-night more of the character of a funeral
pall than the brignt nnd inspiring ceremonies
which generally characterize the commence
ment exercises of this and similar institutions
of learning. His chair Is vacant, the wreath
which tonight would have been added to his
scruilof lame as a reward of merit for many
weary days of toil will scon be placed upon
the grassy tomb, whose curtain never outward
swings.
But, fellow-students, words are Idle to ex
press the emotions of a bieedirm heart. I fully
realize the loss that we have all sustained by
this sad calamity, and I can only in conclu
sion say that while we mourn his loss and ex
tend our heartfelt sympathy to his relatives
and friends we shall cherish his memory
among the valuable archives of our happy
schooldays and ever recall his many virtues
as a companion and a faithful ana devoted
classmate ar.d friend.

TRANS-MISSISSIPPI
CONGRESS NEARS
The Call for the Salt Lake
Session Reaches This
City.
California's Pure Food Move
ment Will Bs Boosted Into
National Fame.
Things of Sta'e Interest Pending, As
Is Also a Fight to Bar the
Silver Issu?.
Now tbe Trans-Mississippi Congress of
1897 comes to the front with much signifi
cance to California.
It will convene in Salt Lake City on
July 14, and with the near approach of the
time the official call and other stirrings to
activity have been sent out from St. Louis
by H. R. Whitmore, chairman of the
executive committee, ana W. H. Cuimer,
secretary.
The official calls, with accompanying
circulars and personal letters, hare within
the past day or two been received by W.
L. Merry, secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce, Julian Sonntag, secretary of
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation and twice secretary of the con
gress, and by others concerned. Salt Lake
citizens are just bestirring themselves
with preparations for the great meeting.
This year's meeting of this body will
be as important to California interests as
any that has been held, and perhaps more
so, and there will be a considerable and
an influential delegation from this State.
It is likely that the Trans-Mississippi
Congress of this year will be the instru- j
ment that will magnify the California I
pure food movement into a National one. j
It is the purpose of President Kerr and '
Secretary Sonntag of the Manufacturers' ;
anfl Producers' Association and others to I
ur;*e this pure food campaign before the
Trans-Missis3ippi Congress and boost it
along to Washington in quest of National
legislation and National inspection of
foods.
The local agitation has already borne
National fruit in the establishment here
and at Tacoma of inspectors of tea, and
the "sheepdip," "pare California brandy,"
now being quarreled over, as another re
sult will likely be settled at Washington.
California' -s pure-food agitation may be
exalted at Salt Lake City.
Another matter that California dele
gates will present will be the one of con
vict-made poods in competition with
manufacturers employing free labor.
Many ail over the country who are in
terested in the Trans-Mississippi Coneress
are wondering if it will roar about silver
again this year. At former sessions. De
fore the silver question became a partisan
one, the congress declared itself emphat
ically for silver, but now the matter has
been thrashed through a political cam
paign and been dipped in gall.
William J. Bryan is the president, who
will call the convention to order, and
some doubt the ability of Mr. Bryan and
some others to keep the silver question
out of anything.
And then there is beet sugar. Tbat is
going to be a big subject at the congress
now, when a tremendous development of
this industry all over the West has just
begun; and to no State does it mean so
much as to California. The Hawaiian
question will assume a Digger importance
man ever before, ar.d will undoubtedly
cause an earnest and heated discussion.
Trade with Mexico and with China an! 'â 
Japan, arid lands, raniee culture and Ja
panese competi:ion are among ihe other
matters to come up in which California is
largely interested. Tne objects of the
congress are to secure National legislation
tbat will promote the interests and deve

JACOB Z. DAVIS
HAD HIS HOBBY
Gathered the Bones of His
Relatives in Church
Graveyard.
Marble Slabs Erected Bearing
Appropriate Inscrip*
tions.
Recognition of the Name of Dedaksr
That May Have Bearing in the
Will Contest.
George A. Knight was compelled to re
yeal the strength of his position in the
Jacob Z. Daris will contest yesterday.
Mr. Knight and his associates, Charles
Reggerty and George D. Collins, are
anxious to secure a delay of a few weeks
for the purpose of obtaining depositions
from witnesses who reside outside the
Stute. The proponents of tfie will insist
that enough time has been devoted to
preliminaries, and object to further post
ponement.
A remarkable hobby of the late Mr.
Davis was brought to light. It appears
that he was anxious to collect tue bones
ot his ancestors and relatives in one
burying-ground, and this peculiarity may
prove of value to the contestant:', as they
claim it will constitute a proof of their
blood relationship to the decedent, since
their immediate ancestors are included in
Mr. Dayis' graveyard collection. It is ad
mitted that Belle Curtis and Lizzie Muir
are not blood relatives of the deceased,
but that they are nieces of Mr. Davis'
wifeâ that is, their mother was Mrs.
Davis' sister.
In support of his motion for a continu
ance Mr. Knight Bubmitied an affidavit
setting forth a full history of Jacob Z.
Davis' family, and incidentally establish
ing the fact that his name was Jacob Zig
ler Dedaker, son of Francis Dedaker and
Catherine Zig'er. Sufficient explanation
ot tnis cfiange of name has already been
made, the circumstances in noway reflect
ing on the character of the deceased, rie
left home at an early age, and desiring to
avoid any interlerence by relatives or
others adopted the name of Davis, by
which he was afterward Known, though
on the death of his mother he returned to
Philadelphia, and under the name of
Dedaker took his share of the maternal
estate. The moner thus obtained was the
basis of Davis' ?2,000.000 fortune, Mr.
Knieht says, and he argues that the blood
relatives are therefore entitled to a por
tion of it.
It is alleged in Mr. Knieht's affidavit
that I- zzie Muir and Belie Curtis, the
proponents of the will and equal bene
ficiaries under the will to the exclusion of
all others, denied that the true name of
the testator was Dedaker, but that their
attorneys subsequently admitted this
fact, and promised to file a sup
plemental answer to this effect. In
order to strengthen his position regard
ing the family name of Dedaker. Mr.
Knight cites the fact that some months
before his death Mr. Davis devoted a great
deal of time and money to collecting the
ashes and remains of his ancestors and
relatives. He had them removed to the
DunKards' churchyard, Germantown, in
the suburbs of Philadelphia, where they
were given a final resting-place, with ap
propriate gravestones and inscriptions.
Among tho*e mentioned in Mr. Davis' list
of relatives were his mother, Catherine
Dedaker, and his aunt, Rebekah Mason
(born Dedaker). Mr. Davis further mani
fested bi< interest in the old Dunkard
church, which was founded by his grect
grandfather, by having a new wing added
to the church at a cost of $10,000, thepians
for the same being drawn Dy Architect
John M.Curtis, husband of Mrs. Curtis,
one of the legatees herein.
The most interesting statement made
by Mr. Knight is that at the moment oi
Mr. Davis' death he was in the act of
dictating a will, which was being written
down by John Senderhng, a relative of
the Dedaker family. It was expected by
the contestants that Mr. tenderling would
appear at the trial, but he has refused to
do so and declares that he will not reveal
the contents ot the paper prepared or
written by him at the time mentioned ex
cept by order of court. That paper is now
locked up in the vaults of the North
American Trust Company of Philadelphia
and the contestants ask for time to pro
cure.it.
Mr. Knigbt says he will be able to prove
by Mr*. Annie Beitel of Philadelphia that
after Mr. Davis' death both of the bene
ficiaries under the wili told her that Mr.
Davis left no will, and that he made no
provision for them; that just before he ex
pired he called for pen, ink and paper in
order to write a will, but declared that he
could not, as his pulse had stopped.
Because of the premises hereinbefore
stated and in order to allow time for ob
taining evidence requisite in having a fair
trial Mr. Knight requests a continuance
of the case until the 10th of August. At
that time he expects to be able to present
tue depositions of a great many witnesses
to substantiate these allegations. He says
his clients are too poor to get ready sooner
than the date mentioned.
Argument will be heard by Judge Cof
fey to-day touching the right of the con
testants for a further continuance. Pend
ing a decision of tiis point the jnry was
excused until next Monday morning.
ROYAL ARCANUM DAY.
The Manner in Which It Was Observed
by Argonaut and Golden West
Councils of This City.
Royal Arcanum day. the twentieth anni
versary of the foundation of this order,
was celebrated last evening in Native Sons'
Hall by Argonaut Council No. 597 and
Golden West Council No. 1716, by an en
tertainment and dance. For the occasion
the hall was prettily decorated.
The entertainment opened with an over
ture by the orcnestra. which was followed
by a soprano solo by Miss Jessie Barstow.
Then Colonel J. J. Tobin delivered an
address in which he dwelt upon the rise
of the order in the United States. The
Royal Arcanum, he said, was started in
the city of Boston by nine men on the
20th of May, 1877, and on the Ist of last
Ar>ri! the membership had increased to
192,194, and in that period the order had
paid in death benefits the sum of $39,854,
--642. HÂ« then at length detailed the merits
of the order and its management, and ad
vised the young men, especially those con
templating matrimony, to become mem
bers oi the association.
Professor Opilvie Bang a tenor solo,
afier which there was a recitative and
cayanna :rom Verdi's "I Vespri Siciliani"
by A. B. Fateiy. After this little Miss
Kosa G jld g;\ve a fancy dance. The pro
gramme ended with a bass solo by J. P.
Grodgens.
The floor was then cleared for dancing,
which was kept up until past the hour of
midnight.
The celebration was nnder the direction
of the follovrinc named:

CITY OWNERSHIP
FIRMLY URGED
The Water Committee of
the Supervisors
Spsaks.
Supervisors Rottanzi and C in
to n Urge Sweeping Re
ductions.
If the Committee's Plans Be Adopted
It Will Be a St p Toward
Collectivism.
The Supervisors met as a committee of
the whole last night to consider tne ques
tion of fixing water rates for the year. The
body did not convene untii after 9 o'clock,
though there was considerable caucusing
in ad ranee. When Mayor Phelan called
the committee to order the ioilowing were
present: Haskins, Delaney, Dodge, Lack
man, Rottanzi, Morton, Britl, Smith and
Clinton.
Mayor Pheian stated that the Supreme
Court had decided that the Mayor had no
right to participate in the fixing of rates,
and he would not violate the law. He
said the fixing of water rates was the most
important function the Doard could exer
cise.
The committee elected Supervisor Dodge
chairman for the eveniim and Mayor
Pheian took a scat in the audience as a
spectator. Dr. Clinton then read the re
port of the water committee, which was
in part as follows:
San Francisco. May 20. 1897.
To the Honorable Beard of Supervisors of the
City and County of San Franciscoâ Gentlemf.x :
The extended investigation made this y-ar
into the t.ubjeci of water rates by the board
has convinced your committee that early steps
should be taken by this City to acquire muni
cipal ownership of its own water supply and
works.
The annual attempts, whether reai or merely
specious, to obtain by investigation the data
upon which to fix rates that shall be just and
iair, both to the water company anJ to the
consumers, are painfully demoralizing in their
effect upon the community.
These annually recurring investigations by
the Board of supervisors are popularly be
lieved to beschoois for X'crjury, In -.\hich men
who, during the rest of the year, are regarded
as honorable business aud profess onal men
appear beiore tne public in the roie ol f radii
lent concealers of facts, special pleader* and
faUitiers.
And when the investigations are completed
and the rates for the year are fixed, tie belief
becomes deeply impressed on the public mind
that a "solid seven" or a "solid nine" have
once more been bribed to violate tiieir ante
eleciion pledges and to betray their constit
uents. The moral efljet of all tnis upon the
community is necessurily pernicious
But there is no possible way of avoiding it
except by the City's conduction or acquisi
tion ot its own water works.
No investigation is needed to convince the
great majority of the rau-payers ox San Fran
cisco thai iney are paying excessive rates for
water.
There is no satisfactory reason why this City

should have to pay so much higher rates for
water than any other city of its size in tne
United States. , ...
Municipal ownership is the only possible
means of escape. Â ..
If the corporation which now supplies the
City with water is not willing to sell its works
for a just and reasonable consideration, there
are oiner sources of supply avnilable.
The construction of ntw works at this time
would afford much needed employment lor
both capital and labor in this City and State,
and do much io revive bu.-ine-s ana avert
financial and commercial disaster.
It would at once set to work thousands oi
our unemployed men and millions of idle
capnal, putting into circulation the money
now hoarded in the banks, aud greatly bene
fitting business generally.
And the great fall in the prices of all
materials to be used would very much lessen
tne v.-ost of construction. Besides, a never
failing supply of pure water, say from the
Sierras, coula be made sufficient to also supply
interior towns lor irrigation and mining pur
poses, Â«nd from the assured Income, outside of
supp.ying this City and County, sufficient
revenue would be realized in time to pay the
imprest on the bonds by the increased receipts.
The recommendation in favor oi the city
acquiring water works of its own is not made
in any spirit of hostility to the Spring Vulley
Water Works.
Your committee has the highest adToiration
for the magnificent works constructed under
ttie direction of Heri'ian Schussler, its tal
ented engineer, of whose marvelous achieve
ments the company and this State have just
reason to be proud.
They have nothing but commendation for
the uniformly kind, just and even generous
treatment which the company nas accorded to
its employes.
Nor. in our opinion, are the salaries paid to
theotiicersof the company either exorbitant
or extravagant.
If the pjople of San Francisco must be de
pendent upon a private corporation for their
water supply we believe they will receive as
lair treatment from the Spring Valley Water
Company as they can reasonably expect to re
ceive from any other private corporation.
The fault is not in tlie company, but in the
system.
Your committee, in all fairness, have to
state that the Spring Valley Water Works, in
the face of great difficulties, have succeeded in
giving this City a supply ot water which is
not only abundant, but of excellent quality
and equal to that of any city In the United
States.
The City reservoirs are nine in number, at
elevat'Oi.'s from 108 leet to t>oo feet above
City base, and of a joint capacity ol about
90,000,000 gallons.
Tte main pipes connecting the larje coun
try reservoirs and streams with the City vary
from 30 inches up to 44 inches in diameter
aud hare an aggregate length ot over seventy
miies.
To deliver the proper amount of watÂ«r into
such reservoirs in this City as are located
above the gravitation level five separate
pumping plants are employed, of which the
ones at Beimont, Ltke Merced and B!a<k
Point are doubie engines, while the Seven
teenth-s'.reet and Ocean View stations are
siiiele.
The City distributing pipe system has a
length of over 350 miles, and its fire efficiency
owiny to great pressures and la: ge n.ains is
being constantly improved.
The policy of this company in preventing
opposition by acquiring water sites and
sources shows an active business enterprise
to lock alter the main chanceâ the pockets of
its stockholders. .And it mi u h s as well be
roncedea and understood that this corpora
tion is the master of the situation, and will
continue so to be, untii, as stated, the CUjr
and County purchases or condemns its works
or obtains water from other sources.
The condition of the people ol this City is no
longer such as to euablu th?m to hear the bur
dena wnich any private corporation \>i.l in
sist on imposing npon mem, not from a willful
and perverse desire to overburden and op
pres>,, but from the very necessity and nature
of th" case.
It is vain to exrect them to do otherwise.
And where the corporation enjoy* a monop
opiy it is follj to hope that it wJI not inr-ist
upon the privileges which the monopoly con
fers npÂ«.n it.
The s?pr:ng Valley Company own* real es
tate in this City whose value depends u:>on
and has been largely increased by the pres
ence of an increased populmion.
As tho value ot this property rises from year
to year from this rause The direct >rs of the
company demand that tho very rate-payers
whose presence here has increased that vnlue
shall pay ircreaied rotes X- meet the interest
on the increased vrlue of the property.
And it is impos>ible to convince the direct
ors of any private corporation that such a
course of proceeding is not iair to the rate-
payers.
Again, the company has acquired iarge
properties outside of the City for the purpose
of preventing competitionâ that b, 10 keep
water out ol the Cityâ yet the City is called
upon to pay interest upon these investments.
Nor, in tne opinion oi your committee, will
it be possible to convince the directors of any
private corporation that such a course is un
lair to tho City.
Municipal ownership affords the only eiTec
tual way out of the difficulties aDove enumer
ated.
The committee of the whole have been patient
and have devoted a great deal of time (some
four month.-) to endeavors to ascertain their
duty in the premises, and your committee have
in addition mn<ie it their particular study
how to effect such a material reduction as
wou'.d be perceptible to the householders.
The practice heretofore of making iui appar
ent 5 or 10 per cent reduction on water rates
prac.icaiiy resulted in little or no benefit to
the householder.
Your committee, therefore, under the cir
cumstances, have determined that 5 percent
interest on the stock ot the company, winch
stock now issued amounts to $12 800,000, is
uot alone reasonable, but in excels of the rate
to be derived tana general investments, loans
or deposits, and being guaranieed even for one
year, will not dis'urb or reduce, except tor
ipe* uiative purposes, tne value of the stock.
In addition your committee has detetmined
that the sum oi .f 03,000 is a reasonable
amount to estimate lor tne increase oi revenue
during tne year.
The increase of revenue of 1800 over that of
the year 1895 amounts to $81,450, so that thj
estimate made cannot be questioned as hav
ing any eleuieni of doubt as to the collection
of the amount estimated.
These two items will effect an estimated re
duction ol $191,000, and it applied to all the
rates would secure a reduc. ion of 10.07 per
cent bassed on the total revenue of the year
1890. But that does not apj>ear to your com
mittee to be desirable, as the purpose of secur
ing a reduction independent of o.lut reasons
is to have the benetU extended to nousenold
ers and secured to them a substantial reduc
tion of rates.
Mr. Booker, chief clerk of Ihe water works,
informs us that about $(iOO,OOO was collected
from meter rates in 1890. This gives some
data upon which todeiermiue the estimated
revenue received for household and special
household rates which amount t0 5955,152.
And the foregoing recommit dation oi your
committee win have the effect of reducing
tnose rates 20 per cent, a substantial, much
needed and demanded reduction, which every
Householder will be able at once on the pre
sentation of his bill to understand and appre
ciate.
This will be a reduction to those who in jus
tice are entitled to it, and, while reducing the
rates named 20 per cent, will leave the other
rates as at present, and will make the work of
readjustment easy and inexpensive to the
company.
To illustrate:
1 per cent interest of stock, allowing 5 In
lieu of 6 percent on *11i,800.U00 $128,000
Estimated additional revenue 63,000
Making an estimated reduction of *191,00U
To ascertain the reduction to be made to
householders, the revenue of 1896 shows:
From water, private consumers $1,553,153
Less revenue collecied lor meter rates. . 600,0*0
The estimated amount paid by house
holders 1963,152
When a family occupy rooms back of a store
â often the c?.se rmong poor tradesmen â the
order eliminates the More charge and makes
ii the schedu.e house charge. Small gardens
are encouraged by striking out the 20-"ent
rate.
This reduction if applied to household rates
alone will reduce them as stated 20 per cent.
This ii the result that appears practicable.
It is proptr to etale that there is no question
but the Spring Valley Water Works by the
combination ol the water companies in the
year 1805 increased its capltnl stock greatly In
excess of the value of its works or the amount
invested in the enterprise.
The history of the Calaveras deal, the ac
quirement of property that otherwise might
constitute a nucleus for supplying this City
and County, the holding of property no"t
required in the business of supplying water
and the consequent expense to the city are
â¢11 unanswerable arguments in favor of muni
cipal ownership.
Your committee therefore recommend that
the Doard invite from parties owning avail
able sources of supply proposals to .self to the
City and County of San Francisco the water
rights and works necessary to supply to its in
habitants an abundance of pure fiesh water
adequate for all purposes, and that provision
be made in the next tax levy for the payment
of competent engineers to examine into and
report upon the various sources of supply
oflered to the board. In order that the board
may be able at as early a date as possible to
submit to the vote of the electors the question
whether or not the City shall acquire its own
water works.
iii conclusion your committee present and
further recommend the passage of the nccom
nanying order making a reduction of 20 per
cent on household and household special
rates ana recommend its passage, and submit
herewith the opinion of the expert as to the
mode in which the books and accounts of the
company are kept. C. A. Clinton, President.
Dr. Clinton spoks in behalf of the re

port and urged the importance of taking
early steps to obtain city control. He
held that delay might result in combina
tions to put up the price of the works. He
held that the fixing of water rates was the
crucial test of the honesty of the board.
Supervisor Smith opposed the resolu
tion and report of the committee, holding
that an injustice was done to business
houses and an opportunity left for the
company to raise rates in business centers
to recoup themselves for their losses on
household reductions. He held, aisc,
that there was no provision for meter
rates.
Dr. Rottanzi offered an amendment to
the order provided by the committee.
The amendment cut down the sum pro
vided for hydrants from $189, 000 to $100,
--000. Dr. Rottanzi' s resolution provides
the following rates for buildings occupied
by a single family, covering the following
ground surfaces:

Dr. Rottanzi spoke in favor of municipal
ownership and his own resolution and
charged that the Alameda investment of
the Spring Valley Water Company was
not made became water was needed from
that county, but to prevent other compa
nies from "competing. He quoted figures
from previous reports and said: "The
skill of the water company's eminent en
gineer in building dams is not so great as
his skill in engineering hieh rates through
the Board of Supervisors."
The doctor said the average reduction
of racs in bis amendment was 17.46 per
cent, 11 per cent on mettr rates, 22 per cent
on shipping and far more on hydrants,
for the purpose of lowering insurance
rate 3 an:l encouraging the placing of more
hydrant?.
ThÂ« following two sections ia Dr. Rot
tnnzi's amendment are wholly new, mak
ing it posj.ble to fine the officers of the
water company for shutting off water
arbitrarily:
Seo. 15. No person, company or corpora
tion supplying wa'er can arbitrarily shut
off water when any person, company or cor
pura.io.i should remonstrate about over
charges; but when any person, firm or cor
poratlo i snould demand investigations of
such overall arises, thereby plrcliik the amount
oi ftÃcu charges in escrow, they shall con
tinue to be supplied with water uutil such
charges are thoroughly investigated and set
tled.
Sec. 17. Any person, company or corpora
tion violating the provisions of any section of
this order shall be deemed guilty of a misde
meanor and punisbib.e either by a fine ol
not le.-s than !}>lÂ«H) nor more than $500 or by
imprisonment In the County Jail tor not less
than thirty or more than ninety days, or by
both such fine and imprisonment.
Supervisor Smith moved that the clerk
of the board be instructed to furnish a
copy of Dr. Rottansi's order to every
member of the board, afier which the
committee aajourned untii Tuesday
night, the purpose of adjourning from
day to day being also embraced ia the
motion.
Attorney Kellogg of the water com
pany stated that the company did not
want the rates fixed hurriedly, as he
â¢â '.anted time to show thf fallacies of the
board's position. He held that the pro
posed action would reduce the company's
dividends to less than 4 per cent.
Dr. Clinton replica that the committee's
report was based on facts brought out by
the investigation, and he thought they
were fÂ»ir.
Supervisor Smith thought the commit
tee's rate would not benefit 'he poor neo
ple, out the landlords ol the City only.
Engineer Schu^sler afked permission to
speals. He*aid: "1 wish to correct some
of Dr. Clinton's errors. I forgive Dr.
Rottanzi, for he knows no better."
Dr. Rottanzi â I defy you to show my
mistakes. Ii 1 have made any they have
not been willful.
Mr. Schussier then â¢aid that the Spares
of Dr. Clinton woulo reuce the com
pany's interest to a com 4 per cent, while
Dr. Rottanzi's would bring it to 3 per
cent. Dr. Rottanzi insisted that his rate
would not redttce the income to 3 per
cent if tne basis of $9,000,000 capitaliza
tion, instead of R watered stock basis of
$12,030,000, be figure a upon by the board.
He proposed to eliminate the watered
Â«tock.
FRAWLEY IS BACK AGAIN.
He Brings With Him a Lot o
New Plays and Also
Players.
The Actor Is Jubilant Over Bright
Prospects for the Coming
Season.
Although tired out with their hot jour
ney across the Arizona desert, Daniel
Frawley and his company, who arrived
last night, were fall of enthusiasm over
their travels, their new plays and the re
hearsals in prospect for the opening of the
Frawley season at the Columbia Theater
Monday week.
Blanche Bates, "who has resisted all
temptations to remain in New York or
London, will continue to be the icadinc
lady of the company, although Ei nor
Moretti will also have leading pans.
Gladys Wallace, who was here with John
Drew on his last visit, and Georgia Busby,
are also members of the company, as well
as such old lavorltes as Madge (Jar.- Cook
and Pbosa McAllister. Worthing and
Carsen Clarke are still true t<> (he Fraw
ley banner, and the new men include J.
M. Colviile as heavy man and Theodore
Hamilton, who has been released by
courtesy of Joe Jefferson, and will play
old men.
in regard to plays, .Krawley does not
seem to have found the market so empty
as stars and managers are in the habit of
declaring.
"Lorrimer Stoddard accompanies ns,"
said Frawlcy, "and I have contracted
with him for a new play, which is nearly
completed. The title is not qnite settled
upon. Mr. Stoddard favors The Daugh
ters of New York,' but I suggest 'The
Canons.' The play treats of modern New
York society and contains a good deal
about Sorosis and the Women's Club.
There are seven women's parts in it.
"In 'The Two Little Vagrants' Miss
Bnsby and Mixs MÂ«retti will play -lie
leading parts. Miss Bates expects to find
the opportunity of her life in 'Sue,' dra
matized from Bret Hnrte by Edgar Pem
berton; 'Shenandoah* will take the entire
cast. William Haworth is finishing a
play for us, and although we have not
quite settled terms yet I expect to secure
Malcolm Watson's 'The Game of Life,'
which Charles Wyndbam will produce in
London next autumn."
Rehearsals for the opening production,
"The Fatal Card," begin to-day.
THE DEBS
PLAN TO
AID LABOR
A Local Branch of the
Co-operative Common
wealth.
TO FOUND A COLONY
THIS YEAR.
Hope Seen in Inducing tbe
Masses to Go to the 'Land
for Aid.
MANY WILL CONTRIBUTE
THEIR MITE.
An Elab rate Plan of Manufacture
and Exchange of Products Is Part
of the Schimr
The hope of a new dawn, which Eugene
V. Debs and other members of the Ameri
can Railway Union think they see iv a
sort of co-operative commonwealth, is
reaching the lormative stage in this City.
The work is being carried on by M. E.
Morse and a band of hopeful converts to
tbe commonwealth idea.
The society of which Mr. Morse is the
leader meets at 2 P. m. every Sunday at
418 McAllister street ani it has hopes that
the idea will soon be popular all over the
State.
The co-operative commonwealth is the
specific remedy that the society proposes
for the congestion of population in busy
centers, and the lobor-exchange idea, as
organized by Slate Organizer Clark, is the
scheme Debs recommends as a solution in
part of the money problem.
In a recent letter to the society Debs
dcsciibed the plan as follows:
Industrial co-operation as the basis of a
higher type of civilization will be the princi
pal object.
Soon after the work is under way it is pro
posed to begm active operations in some West
ern State. The State will te colonized by our
people, the leaders will converge there, a full
ticket will bo nominated and we will undoubt
edly have votes enough to secure comp.ete
possession and control of the Slate Govern
ment. We will then establish the co-operative
commonwealth ami the State Government
will be in harmony with it. The labork-ss
thousands of the country will De invited to
the State and will be given equal opportuni
ties with all others to develop its resources
and enjoy "life, liberty and the pursuit of
nappiucss."
The headquarters of the organization
are at Thomaston, Me., and the following
are the officer^: President, Myron W.
Heed; secretary, N. \V. Lerniond; organ
izer, Eugene V. Deb.; dean, Professor
i rank- Parsons; editor, A. S. Edwards;
master workman, W. J- feniith.
Tha following excerpts from the local
prospectus show the plans in view:
In nearly every branch of industry thousands
of men anil women are being displaced by
labor-saving machinery, owned by h. few
money lords, and vast out as driftwood 10 float
up and down in aâ to themâ cheerless world.
A few thoui-and dollars Invested in land,
bu;ldlngs and machinery will provide means
where by these people, by co-oper.mng and
employing themselves upon their own farms,
in their own factories and mills, may produ c
all the necessaries and many luxuries of life
and. retaining tno wealth thus created, gai i
ireedom.
should 10,000 men ani women, uniting
their ellorts and means, eacu on an average
contributing $100, come together in a favor
ably located section of the country, while they
miiji i not be nble to â¢.â slablisn the co-operative
commonwealth eniire, yet they could carry
on co-operative industry on a sufficiently
large scale to be practically free from outside
competition. With a cash capital of $1,000,
--000 these 10,000 industrials can buy -.ufficient
land and machinery to start them on the road
to industrial freedom. But until such time as
they cau raise their own lood and provide
themselves with ot her necessaries these pioneer
colonists will need help irom the reserves.
Let those who arc uulding :ucr.nive posi
tions under capitalist employers and who dv
not wish to outer the brotherhood community
at first contribute monthly from thuir earn
ings such sums from 10 cents to if 10, as they
cau spare or duty dictates. If, when the in
dustrials are ready to begin acuvs work, there
are 25,000 reserve*, each on an average con
tributing monthly $1, $25,000 will be availa
ble cacti month to sustain these pioneers
while "breaking ground" and getting under
way. Since, however, no active industrial
work will bedonefor at least five months
contributions io the colonization fund being
naid in during that periodâ v sura of at lea-t
$3(5,000 will have accumulated. If the growth
01 the brotherhood is sower than here esti
mated, yet, nevertheless, it is only a question
of time when these figures will be readied.
At any rate, should there be only 1000 indus
trials and 5000 reserves a beginning can be
made next spring.
The local brotherhood is yery hopeful
that relief will come to thousands within
another year, and members who are sup
posed to be close to the National leaders
say that there are prospects thatastait
will be made somewhere in miudle Ten
nessee. If the plan succeeds there, with
the aid of members all over the Union,
the next proposition will be to organize a
branch colony in California for the ac
commodation of the overflow.
There is great confidence in local circles
that the movement, already given an im
petus oy Debs, will soon prove very popu
lar in this City and throughout the West.
The plan is to assess each member ot
the National organization 10 cents per
month, this sum to go ultimately toward
establishing and maintaining the colony
until sucli time as it siiall be placed on a
paying basis. It is the purpose of the in
dustrial department to build factories,
mills and shops. The function of the ex
change department is to have charge of
the distribution of all products and com
modities, establishing a warehouse in
each colony for the products of the facto
ries, farms and mi Is. The superintend
ent of thisdepnnment snail keep accounts
with each colony, and all orders for goo.is
shall pass through his hands. This de
partment shall act as a central clearing
house.
Leaders of the local ordsr say they are
well pleased with the progress made up
to date and they believe there is a bright
future for the order.

ROBBED BY A PICKPOCKET.
Her Parse Taken While Leaving the
Ferry-Boat on Her Way to
San Rafael.
Mrs. Eleanor Martin, the well-known
society leader, had her Docket picked by
an enterprising thief Tuesday morning
while on the way to the Hotel Rafael at
San Rafael.
Mrs. Martin went over on the 11 o'clock
boat tiiat carried the bulli of those bound
to Schueiz3n Park to attend the retail gro
cers' picnic, and it was while leaving the
steamer thai the iight-fingered gentry
successtully plied their trade andrelieved
Mrs. Martin of her valuables.
There was a big crowd on the steamer,
and when tne gangplanfc was let down
sevend hundred people made a rush for
the wharf to secure >:ood seats in the train.
Mrs. Martin was jostled a number of
timrs, but thought nothing of it until she
reached her m-at in the cars, when she
looked for her pocket-book and found it
missing.
On reaching San Rafael Mrs. Martin
telephoned to Chief of Police Lees, and
the Chief promised to make a determined
effort to locate the pickpocket aud recover
the valuables stolen.
So far as Airs. Martin can remember
ihere was about $10 in money in the purse,
consisting of a $5 gold piece and aome
silver.
In addition Mrs. Martin lost a number
of valuable trinkets and some papers that
she is loin to part with. It is these docu
ments that the lady is most anxions to re
cover, her sreat wealth making the mone
tary loss a small matter to her.
Mrs. Martin i 6 the mother of J. Downey
Harvey, the well-known man about town,
ana her sister was the late Mrs. Peter
Donahue.

Several communications were read and
were referred to appropriate committees.
These resolution were adopted:
Resolved, That we are believers in the theory
advanced by Rev. Father Mclaughlin and
Rev. Father Phillips Comvay that the A. O. H.
Board ol Erin has no use for a member born of
a Chinese Inther or vice versa, as in Ireland
mixed or hybrids were not known in con
ducting the ufl'iilrs of the A. O. H., nor
were they ever admitted to membership;
Resolved, Tnat the Ancient Order ot Hiber
nians BoaM 01 Erin recognizes the fact that
a* American citizens, while we owe our alle
giance to America, siili wa cannot heip think
ing reverently of the land of our Dirth.
Resolved, Tnat in viow of the stirring events
of 1798, ftt the centennial next year, at a
time to be decided on, the A. O. H. Board of
Erin give a literary entertainment, the pro
gramme of which is to be of an Irish national
character.
Resotveri, That we extend the glad hand of
fellowship to our brothers in Europe and
Australia and .hope the utmost confidence
shall be continued without lha Â«id of hybrids,
Dolly Vardens or Roneens.

KEW TO-DAT.
Froebel, the great promotor of the kin-
dergarten system of teaching children said:
"Let parents not live for their children, but
with them." The mother who understands
this sentiment lives with, even her unborn
child. She studies to be wise about herself
and the little life she is fostering. She does
all she can to give her child a fair start in
life, by giving it a strong well developed
body. All through babyhood, childhood
and youth she lives with her son or her
daughter. Especially her daughter she will
keep near her. She will allow no false
modesty to stand i:i the way of that daugh-
ter's knowledge of herself, of her possibili-
ties, of her perils. She will teach her that
happy, healthful motherhood is an honor,
a blessing. That sickness is a mistake, a
breaking of nature's law. But there are
times of unavoidable overdoing when the
system becomes run-down.
For over thirty years Dr. Pierce has used
his " Favorite Prescription " as a strength-
ener, a purifier, a regulator. It works
directly upon the delicate, distinctly femi-
nine organs, in a natural, soothing way. It
searches out the weak spots; and builds
them up. It is beneficial in any state of the
system. A woman who would understand
herself will find an able assistant by send-
ing 21 cents to the World's Dispensary
Medical Association, Buffalo, N. V., for Dr.
Pierces Common Sense Medical Adviser.
It is a book that has reached its 68oth thou-
sand. It contains in its 1008 pages an im-
mense store, of information in plain words
that any person will rtadily understand.
Mr. O. G. Spear, of Sand Bank. Onvrgo Cb.,
New York, testifies in this wise: "Our first
child was born before my wife was sixteen years
old. Afterward her health was very poor. She
tried Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription. She
gained flesh and strength by using two bottles.
During the last few weeks of her second preg-
nancy she again used the " Prescription." Her
confinement wa* a rapid mud easy one, and abt
got up strong and well."
