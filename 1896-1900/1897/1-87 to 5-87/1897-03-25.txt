WASHINGTON, D. C.. March 24.âRep
resentative A. F. Fox. th* Mississippi
Democrat who succeeded Senator Money
from the Fourth District of that State,
opened the third day's debate upon the
â¢ tariff bill. He opposed the bill for the
reason .that the protective tariff system
aided manufacturers at the expense of the
farmers. It could not be otherwise, he
said, for what was don? for one class must
necessarily be at the expense of the other.
Sims (D.) of Tennessee followed in a
similar speech against the bill.
Williams (D. ) ot .Mississippi also op
posed the bill. It would not in his opin
ion, he said, produce the desired results,
any more than the repeal of the purchas
ing clause of the Sherman bill at the spe
cial session in 1893 produced the "confi
dence" in our currency that was then
held -oat to be tbe inevitable consequence
of declaring against the free, unlimited
and independent coinage of silver. The
â¢ difficulty under which the people were
laboring was not that the country was buy
. ing' goods from abroad, but that it was not
buying them from anywhere â it had not
firi. r/?e mem*? to buy .it Kli.
A fourth speech against the bill was
I made by Terry (D. ) of Arkansas.
' Sayers (D.) of Texas protested against
tbe passage of the bill for the reason that
sufficient time was not allowed the House
in which to consider it. The distinguished
gentleman from lowa (Dolliver), said Mr.
Sayers, spoke eloauenily yesterday of the
beauties and benefits of protection. -
The first extended speech of the day
was that of Johnson (R.) of North Da
kota, a member of the Committee on
Ways and Means, in support of the bill.
He addressed himself in the beginning to
the financial necessities of the Govern
ment It required $500,000,000 a year to
pay the i ordinary expenditures of the
Government, and unless some great
calamity befell the country which would
â¢ destroy its capacity and its powers, no
Congress could ever assemble In tnesf
halls that would be other than a billion
dollar Congress. It' was agreed on all
hands that most of this money should be
raised by a tariff, but what kind of a tariff
should be levied made the difference
between the parties. It was a sharply
denned defense, and upon the adoption of
one or the otherâ protective or 'revenueâ
he believed depended the prosperity or
depression of "the business of the ipuutry.
This bill, Johnson said in conclusion, was
as patriotic as the flag, as broad as tne
country. [Applause.]
At 12:30 McMiliin (D.) of Tennessee
rose to oppose the bill, 'and his appear
ance, was the signal for applause from his
political associates, j He opposed the bill
in a speech of more th in an hour's length.
He asserted that there was no necessity
for imposing additional taxes at this time.
and* that with even ordinary economy
there would still be a large surplus in the
treasury when Congress should assemble
* "in December. g
' i Proceeding to the merits of the bill Mc-
AMillin ' said the Republicans of . the'
Country had been, taught a lesson regard
ing bounties, and in this connection he
taunted the majority with â¢ having aban
doned free sugar, the beauties of which

,in the melodious tones of r the present
chief magistrate, then the chairman of
the committee on Ways and Means. By
their, arguments McMillin claimed that
the Republicans admitted that a tariff
was a tax and a burden. paid by the con
â¢ Burners. .
. Continuing, he said: "Not only have
the gentlemen reimpo<jed this burden of
taxation, but in doing so they have taken
good care of the corporations and trusts
which now control the sugar market In the
'presence of. these gentlemen who framed
this bill it was demonstrated by witnesses
. who came before the Ways and s Means
Committee at the hearings, first, that a ri
gantic trust existed in this country to con
â¦ trol manufacturers, 'regulate -prices and
increase their- profits; secondly, that the
. wings of this trust/ the 'Eastern and the
Western, have entered into an agreement
by which they farm out and appropriate
the territory of this great Government
and these 72,000,000 people among them
selves, each agreeing to supply certain
portions ot the territory, and not to in
vade the other's territory, nor within the
other's territory cut prices; thirdly, that

â¢ ment of these 'tacts, the profit to the trust
is raised by this bill trom one-eighth of a
cent a pound \- by ; the , present law to from â 
36. to 50 cents on the hundred pounds dif
ference between raw and refined.
' ' "I opposed putting .': sugar on the free
list originally and < the substitution of a

bounty paid for a tax received. I believe
yet that the sugar tax, beinc purely and
almost wholly a revenue tax, is a legiti
mate tax, but I do not believe that while
levying that tax we ought to foster and
perpetuate the sugar trust in the way thai
it is done ia this bill."
McMiliin criticized also the increase in
duty on tin plate made in the bill, de
nouncing it as unwise and oppressive.
Another item in the bill which met tits
disapproval was the retention of the pres
ent duties on pig iron and steel rails,
while the manufacturers of them in the
United States were exporting their
products. He devoted much time to a
consideration of the agricultural schedule,
wnich he denounced as an attempt to
humbug tbe farmers.
"This bill," said McMilJin, "carries not
only higher rates of duty than the present
law and higher rates than the McKinley
bill,. but higher than any law ever passed
by an American Congress or groaned
under by an American people. The rates
->n woolen goodt were not only higher
than ever seen, but the rates on raw wool
have been increase! by imposing higher
duties on the wool coming from certain
countries than were heretofore imposed.
The rate of duty borne by woolen goods,
taken as a whole and averiged, would
amount to between 99 and 101 per cent.
Thus it is proposed to destroy all possibil
ity of reaching foreign markets with our
woolen goods, to tax the carpets and
clothing of the people more than double
what they are taxed now, to hamper man
ufacturers by excessive duties on raw ma
terial and proclaim to the American peo
ple that against the exactions of the
avaricious there is to be no relief."
The reciprocity clauÂ»e of the bill, Mr.
Miilin said, was a remarkable feature of
this extraordinary bill. "It is remark
able," he said, "for the fact that it gives
! i ito tbe bands of the President absolutely
i ie power to impose taxes and remit taxes
at pleasure."
He made much fun of the free list, and
said that the majority admitted that over
the McKinley bill this measure increased
taxes on the following schedules: Chemi
cals, oils and paints; earth, earthenware
and glassware; wood and manufactures
of wood; sugar, from 14.55 to 71.1 per
cent; tobacco and manufactures of to
bacco, 16 per cent; agricultural products;
spirits, wine.- and other beverages; flax,
hemp and jute and manufactures of; wool
and manufactures of wool; silk and silk
goods: pulp, papers and books; sundries.
In conclusion McMiliin said: "I beg
the gentlemen on the other side to re
member that tbeir victory obtained last
fall was obtained by such an expenditure
of money, such an exhibition of bulldoz
ing and force, and such a prostitution of
elections as was never before witnessed in
this land. They must not take such a
verdict as the established and irrevocable
will of the American peopie. I beg them
to remember that a purchased verdict
cannot stand, it is true fiat Benedict
Arnold sold himself to infamy, but he did
not thereby sell down the Revolution.
"It is true that Judas sold his Savior to
the cross, but he did not thereby sell
down the plan of salvation. The Demo
cratic party has suffered defeat before, and
by stern adherence lo never-failing princi
ple it has re-rained power and readminis
lered government. Let us now and here
resolve anew that the principles of Jeffer
son, of Jackson and of Polk shall be the
principles of tne Democratic party now,
as they have been in the past, and as sure
as day succeeds night it will return to
power and restore the Government to the
constitutional moorings from which it has
been wrested by such mal-le^isiation as
that which is being forced upon us to
day."
McMillin was liberally applauded dur
ing his speech, and his time was extended
half an hour.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio then took the
floor to reply. Speaking of the condition
of the country in November, 1896, hÂ« de
clared that never in tbe history of the
United States was there so much of terror,
foreboding and doubt in the minds of men
as on that date. This great calamity had
come upon the country substantially by
reason of the single act of the Democratic
Congress, the repeal of the McKinley law.
'I lie issue of 189G, upon wbicu the battle
had been fought and the victory won. was
the issue of protective tariff. Every intel
ligent man who i articipated in the cam
paign and went Iron; one State to an
other was conscious now of the fact that
more than a million voters wiio had been
humbugged by tiie specious cry of the
communists of tax upon wealth and en
terprise and the hope for better times
through a debased currency, nevertheless

tion on the tariff question. It was the Me-
Kiuley law misrepresented and misunder
stood that aided our overthrow in 1893,
but it was the McKinley law with the
blessing* we received from it during its
short life that became the talismanic
word that swept McKinley into nomina
tion and carried the country in 1896.
The fruit-grower of California, robbed
and rained by the Wilson bill, cried
loudly to Republicans for assistance, and
from Alabama and Georgia, and conspicu
ously from Louisiana, came earnest de
mands for the passage of this bill. If the
members of the Republican aide of this
house should see tit to publish all the
letters they hays received from the hemp
and tobacco growing Stales of the South
in favor of this legislation, surprise and
astonishment would be upon the faces of
the men who with their backs to the
rising sun were seeing, hearing and know
ing nothing bnt the inadequate Bourbon
doctrine of a bygone day.
He taunted the Democrats and their
allies on the floor of the House with mak
ing a pretext that they had not time to
prepare a substitute for the pending bill.
"Why," he asked, "do you not offer the
Wilson bill? If you did not blunder in
its passage; if its passage was not a crime;
if its introduction into business affairs of
the country did not damage snd condemn
the business of the country, why do you
not offer it as a substitute here? Why do
you not take its specific doctrines, its ad
valorem duties, its protection to special
classes of industries, iti abandonment of
others, its uncertainties, its bad English
and worse politics, and cling to it?"
Sneaking of the provisions of the Ding
ley bill he said: "We have provided in
this bill for the expenditure in the United
States of ultimately more than $300,000,000
per annum to the laborers of the country
a bore that wbicn has been derived hereto
fore.
"We look forward to the time, not far
distant, when a million wool-growers in
the United States, a million men who
voted, who worKed to promote the sheep
industry of the country, will receive rich
and permanent reward, and when the
flocks of rhe country will increase in value
directly by the operation of this' bill $50,
--000,000 in a single year. We believe that
the farmers on the mirhly farms of the
West and on the alluvial soil of the South
will everywhere be benefited by this bill."
Replying to the eulogy of the Demo
cratic party delivered by General Wneeler
of Alabama, Grosvenor arraigned it for all
its past deed*, and closed by saying:
And it is the Democratic party here
to-day, represented by a heterogeneous
mass of conflicting political opinions that
prey upon each other, differ with each
other, have no policy for the future, no
pride of political ancestry, no hope of po
titical posterity, that stands
A u mi (frii k mass of shapeless flame,
a pathless comet and a' curse.
He congratulated his "distinguished
leader" that bis name was to be associated
with another actof redemption. Lincoln's
name, he said, bad been forever linked
with his emancipation proclamation. Me-
Kinley's name had been linked with tr.e
McKinley law and DJngley's law, and
Dincley's name would go sonnding down
the corridors of time as the champion of
the law that after the great struggle of
1896 brought back the country to prosper
ity and peace.
In the course of his remarks Groevenor
was interrupted by Bell (Pop.) of Colorado,
who asked about the statements made in
the campaign of the return of the prosper
ity immediately upon the election of Mc-
Kinley.
Grosvenor replied that he never knew of
any one using the word "immediately,"
and he doubted it Bell could produce a
speech with it in.
. Bell â Yes, many of them; 1 heard them-
Grosvenorâ Well, however, that may be,
I want to say to the gentleman that never
since the time when the morning stars
sang together for joy and the sons of God
rejoiced has there been such rejoicing as
there was in the hour succeeding tbe an
nouncement flashed by the telegraph over
tbe land and under the sea that William
McKinley had been elected. [Loud ap
plause.]
Anotner member of the majority of tbe
Ways and Means Committee, Evans (R.)
of Kentucky, followed Grosvenor in advo
cacy of the bill.
The hour of 5 o'clock having arrived the
committee rose and the House took a
recess until 8 p. M.
Livingston (D. ) of Georgia wns tbe first
speaker at to-niehi's session and indulged
in half an hour's protest against the tariff
bill. A tariff that would bear equally
upon all sections of the country and treat
all interests alike, he said, all parties
could support, but this bill benefited
the manufacturers at the expense of tbe
masses.
Belford (R.) of New York said the Re
publican party was in power to-day under
a solemn pledge to give the people a
speedy execution of iheir will. There was
no room to douot tbe nature of the com
mission given by tbe people. They had
decreed an immediate retnrn to the tinan
ciÂ»l and industrial policies under the
operation of which the country had
shown the most remarkable growth in the
history of the world, and "we will com
mand the largest share of popular re
spect and retain the fullest measure of
popular confidence by simply giving the
people what they have asked for, giving it
to them at once and then goinc home, let
ting the bill wo.-'j out its beneficent re
sults." *
Castle (Pop. and D. ) of California at
tacked the bill most vigorously. The
proper title of the monstrosity, as he des
ignated it, should be, in his opinion, "to
foster trusts and to pauperize and peon
ize the agricultural laborers ol the United
States."
Tbe primary object of the bill, he said,
wen neither to raise revenue nor to en
courage the industries of the United
States, but was designated by its authors
for the express purpose of enabling the
powerful trusts to stanrl up tbe people of
the country and to legally rob them.
"We are tb-rtay," Castle said, "In the
transltorial stage, passing from a re
publican into tbe most odious form of
government known in history â a moneyed
oligarchy. Rome in her decline had her
Cataline; America has her Manna." [Ap~
plause and hisses.]
Brown (R.) of Ohio said it was not
necessary to hold a long session of Con
gress 10 execute the commission placed in
its hands toy the passage of the tariff bill.
In the opposition to it, ha said, we see the
final struggles of another "lost cause."
The new member as well as the old could
see, and did see, in this struegle the old
contest between two different systems of
labor.
Saying that he should vote for the bill,
Kerr (R.) of Ohio criticized the reciprocity
feature as being in bis opinion fatally
defective. The concessions proposed in
the scheme, he said, were so insignificant
in comparison with what we must ask in
exchange that any nation negotiating
with ua for them would be without either
dignity or sense. He urged the substitu
tion for the provisions of the bill of the
reciprocity sections of the McKinley bill,
born in the brain of James G. Blame.
Tbe last speech of the evening was de
livered by Oidstead (ll ) of Pennsylvania
in support of the bill, who addressed six
Representatives on the floor and a score of
visitors in the galleries.
At 11 o'clock the committee rose and on
motion of Sherman (R.) of New York the
House adjourned.

ATHENS, Greece, March 24. â The
Empbemois, which is regarded as reflect
ing the views of King George, in an article
ufion the Cretan dnticnlty emphatically
reafirmt the position of the King. The
article concludes:
"The King will never join himself with
the powers In presing the Cretans to ac
cept autonomy and the suzerainty of the
Sultan, nor will he ever consent to such a
solution of the difficulty. The Cretans
reject autonomy, which their King rejects
also, and will accept only one solution,
namely: That upon which the will of the
nation and the will of the Cretans shul;
agree. Every effort exerted by the powers
in Crete will have its counter stroke on
the frontier and beyond."
Considerable anxiety is felt here for the
safety of the Greek steamer Hera, which
started for Crete on March 19 with a cargo
of provisions for the Greek troops in the

board the steamer were the President of

ARBITRATION IS
NOT A CERTAINTY
Rejection of the Treaty in |
Any Form Is Not
Improbable.
New Senators Show a Disposi
tion to Look Beiore They
Leap.
Determined to Thoroughly Under
stand the Subj ct Before Casting
Their Votes.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 21-The
Senate spent only half an hour in open
session to-day, the remainder of the time
being given to the consideration of the
a: bitration treaty behind closed doors.
The agricultural billâ one of the foinf
money bills tbat failed at the last ses
sionâwas reported back in the shape in
which it passed the House last week and
wa3 placed on the calendar. It will be
acted on at an early day.
The attack upon the civil service law
and its administration, which distin
guished yesterday's proceedings, was fol
lowed up to-day by the introduction of
billsâ one by Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska
for the repeal and annulment of the law
and of all executive orders issued under
it, and the other by Pritcbarci (R.) of
North Carolina, chairman of the Commit
tee on Civil Service and Retrenchment,
modifying its application to the Govern
ment Printing Office.
A bill prohibiting the exhibition in the
District of Columbia of kinotescope illus
trations of prize-tights, and also prohibit
ing the transportation of materials there-
Jo r through the mails or through the
channels of {interstate commerce, was in
troduced by Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts
and was referred to the J udiciary Com
mittee.
An agreement was reached in executive
session this afternoon on an hour for vot
ing on the amendments to the general
treaty of arbitration between the United
States and Great Britain, but consent to
an agreement for the final vote was re
fused. At 2 o'clock next Wednesday
afternoon a vote will be taken on the
amendments, and tne treaty in its then
shape is to be pnrued for the use of tbe
Senate the next day. At 2 o'clock on the
Thursday following the vote is to be
taken upon ail amendments that may be
oQered in the mean inie, and this will be
the last of the votes on proposed amend
ments. From tnat lime on the debate
will proceed on the treaty proper.
Senator Davis made a persistent effort
to secure an hour for the final vote, bat
was confronted with objections that made
such an agreement impossible. It is
thought, however, that with all of the |
amendments out of the way the Senate ,
vote cannot long be postponed. What the
ultimate outcome will be can hardly be
foreshadowed. The opponents of the
treaty profess to have the requisite thirty
votes necessary to compass the defeat of
the treety and say they have several of
the new Senators on their list. The ques
tions asked by these new Senators indi
cate lively interest in the convention and
.a determination to understand the subject
thoroughly before casting their votes. It
ivould not come aa a surpriae to the com
mittee to have the treaty rejected.
. Senator Morgan took the floor imme
diately after the doors were closed and
spoke for an hour or more in advocacy of
the Chilton amendment, reiterating, how
ever, his opposition to the treaty as a
whole.
The Chilton amendment, as has been
stated in ttiese dispatches, makes a very
important change in the tenor of the first
article of the treaty. Under that article
both the contracting parties agree to sub
mit to arbitration under this general
treaty "all questions in difference be
tween them which they fail to adjust by
diplomatic negotiation."
Chii ton's amendment modifies this read
ing so as to make it read that the United
States agrees to submit ail questions
which the benate (which is part of our
treaty-making power) shall decide to be
subjects fit for arbitration.
Tne members of the committee and ,
Senators opposed to any amendments
other tuan those made by the committee
contend that this is the only construction
that can be placed upon the text ot the
treaty, and for that reason they hold that
the amendment is unnecessary.
The advocates of the Chilton amend
ment contend, on the other hand, that if
this is the construction placed upon the
text by the Senate and the committee no
harm can come from the adoption of an
amendment that makes plain what now
appears 10 be somewhat doubtful.
It was also sts ted to-day that the com
ments of the English press, with respect
to the committee amendments which were
agreed to the other day, make it impera
tively the duty of the Senate to so frame
the treaty that there can be no possible
doubt about the intention of the Senate.
Morgan was one of these. He thought
the Cbilton amendment essential and
vital. If the treaty was to be ratified he
wanted it safeguarded in every possible
manner, and warned the Benate that,
. however it might be protected, Great Brit
ain would rind a loophole through which
the Government would evade her duties
under that instrument if her interests
demanded that sac Â±0 escape them.
Morgan was replied to by Lodge, who
declared his belief that the treaty as re
ported to the Senate was amply protect
ive for the United States Government.
To further amend it would but complicate
the languase of the convention. Lodge
made .1 short speech in iavor of arbitra
tion as a principle and eulogistic of the
pending treaty as a proper expression of
the extent to which this Government was
ready to go in that direction.
Chairman Davis and Senator Hoar also
spoke briefly in advocacy of the treaty as
amended by the committee and against
the amendment proposed by the Senator
from Texas.
Spooner insisted that the Chilton amend
ment was not ill-timea, for the reason
that it made clear what appeared to be
the admitted intention or the Senate.
Tl:urston was of tiie same view.
The debate showed that some of the
best lawyers in the Senate thought that
the Cnilton amendment should prevail.
Davis to-morrow will move another ex
ecutive session at as early an hour as pos
sible for the purpose of admitting discus
sion on several amendments that have not
yet been formally submitted.
DESfOILEM Or JIS MBA.XISG.
\fhat Znglith Official* and Paper* Say
of the Treati/.
LONDON, Em>., March 24.-A high
Government official expressed to a repre
sentative of the United Associated
Presses to-day that the United States
Senate bad taken all the meaning out of
the arbitration treaty, and asserted his
belief that the British Government would
be extremely unlikely to accept it.
"We have done without an arbitration
treaty heretofore, " bo said, "and it will
not make much difference if we continue
to do so for the present."
It is learned at the Foreign Office that
diplomatic relations between Great Britain
and Venezuela hayooiot yet been resumed,
ana that the question of their resumption
is not likely to bo discussed until the
Venezuelan "arbitration tribunal has fin
ished its work.
Dr. Juan Pic t re, the present Venezuelan
Minister to Germany and Spain, the
foreign officials say, has not been credited
to Great Britain.
The Westminster Gazette takes the Sen
ate's action a* a very disappointing and
disconcerting result of all the efforts of
Secretary Oiney and Lord Salisbury. The
anti-Enclisli feeling underlying the action
of the Senate, the paper adds, is the most
unpleasant aspect of the matter.
The Pall Mall Gazette says that merely
to please sensational jingoism and self
importance a promising plan has been
wrecked. In concluding the Gazette says:
"We firmly believe the Americans will be
more thoroughly ashamed of their Senate
than they ordinarily are, which is saying
a good deal."
SAM PEDRO'S APPROPRIATION.
Secretary A/ger Inclined to Delay Execu
tion of the Metâ San Francisco's
Public Bui/d ng.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 24.âSen
ator Perkins, Judge Maguire and Repre
sentative Barlow say they believe that
Secretary Alser will delay the execution
of the act of Congress appropriating
$3,000,000 for San Pedro harbor, but they
cannot see how he can afford to do it in
the face of the reports of three different
boards which have reported in favor of
San Pedro or in opposition to the ex
pressed wishes of Congress. Senator Per
kins saw the War Department engineers a
lew days aeo, and frjm what they told
him he believes that advertisements for
bids for the contract work will soon be
issued. Senator Perkins will have an in
terview with Secretary of War Aiger on
the subject in a few days.
The Call correspondent inquired about
the progress of the San Francisco public
buildine: plans to-day. The supervising
architect said:
"The army engineers seem disinclined
to make the tests and want authorization
for Private Engineer Hunter to do the
work, which tney will inspect afterward.
The army engineer* employed Engineer
Moran to do the work betore."
The Call correspondent understands
that the War and Treasury departments
are disinclined to grant this r> quest. They
believe that the army engineers are there
for that purpose and there is no need of
employing any private engineer.

THE BLYTHE CASE
TO BE REOPENED
Justice Field Grants Con
testants a Writ of
Error.
Mrs. Hinckley's Inheritance of
Five Million Dollars h
Involved.
The Celebrated Case Will New Come
Before the United States Su
preme Court.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 21â The
United States Supreme Court will reopen
the celebrated Blythe case, involving
Florence Blythe-Hinckley's inheritance to
$5,C00,000. Yesterday the contestants, the
nearest legitimate relatives of Thomas
Blytbe, and now living in Kentncky and
Arkansas, through their attorney, Hon.
Jefferson Chandler of California, riled an
application for a writ of error, directed to
the Supreme Court of California, which
decided in favor of Florence Blytbe.
Justice Field, alter consultatipn with his
associates (in chambers) to-day decided
to grant the petition.
Mr. Chandler was seen by The Call
correspondent at the Riggs House to
night. He was naturally very much
elated over his success. He said:
"We applied for the writ of error on the
grounds that the California court which*
awarded the property to .Florence Blythe
had no jurisdiction in the matter, and the
proceedings of the State court were void
because Florence was an alien at the time
of Blythe's death. She resided in Eng
land, and did not come to this country
until two months after his death. There
fore she was incapable of taking the prop
erty by descent.
â¢We alleged in our petition that the
California statute purporting to give
aliens the right to inherit is void, because
the whole subject of the rights of aliens
in this country is exclusively within the
jurisdiction of the Federal Government,
and the States have nothing to do with it.
"Justice Field supported us in our con
tention and the caÃe will now be brought
before the full Supreme Court. If it takes
its regular course on the docket it may
not be reached for a year or two. I ex
pect, however, that at the October term
Mr. Hart and the other attorneys for Mrs.
Hinckley will file a motion to dismiss.
The writ of error directed to the Califor
nia Supreme Court is returnable in sixty
days. This latter simply means a trans
fer of the records and does not change the
status in California."

try and defeat his confirmation by the
Senate. Senator Perkins to-night de
clined to discuss ibis last possibility.
"Certainly the President will not disre
gard our advice, 1 ' said he.

BEFORE AN AUGUST TRIBUNAL
A Labor Question Which Will Establish
a Great Precedent Before (ho Highest
English Authorities.
LONDON, Eno., March 24â It has been
reserved for a trade union and a question
of organized labor to bring about the tem
porary organization of the most august
judicial tribunal that ever sat in this
country to hear argument and deliver
judgment even upon a question relating
to the crown. This tribunal, as constituted
by Lord Chief Justice Russell, will assem
ble early next month, and will consist of
the House of Lords, the bench of Lord
Justices of Aupeal, headed by the Lord
Chief Justice and eight Judges of the
Queen's Bench.
The plaintiffs in the case are a number
of non-union boiler-makers, while the de
fendant is the National Boiler-makers'
Union. A year ago the union demanded
of the Glengall Iron Woris that it should
discharge ail the non-union men in its
employ, and threatened in case of a re
lusai to withdraw all the union men from
the works.
The Glengall Company, haying impor
tant time contracts to fulfill, complied
with the wishes of the union and tue non
union men were thrown out. Thereupon
they brought suit against the union and
recovered damages for $25 000. The judg
ment was sustained Id court after court
until it reached the House of Lords.
Here it was again argued, but their lord
ships, in view .of the importance of the
issue, were unable to reach a decision,
and therefore decided that the question
should be reargned and that the Lord
Justices of Appeal and the judges of tha
Queen's bench should take part in the
hearing and in formulating a decision.

LONDON, Enc, Marc!) 24.â 1n the
House to-day Edward H. Fickerxgill (Lib
erai) moved the second reading of the bill
to create a criminal court of appeal. In
support of the bill Mr. Pickersgill com
mented upon the present law, which he
said was extremely unjust. In cases
where innocent persons were condemned
to imprisonment or other forms of pu;i
ishment a secret inquiry into their cases
by the Home Office was their only rorn
edy, a3 a new public trial was impossible.
Under the present law, also, he said,
grossly divergent sentences were imposed
by different judges for tho same offense.
Sir R. L. Kidey, Home Secretary, sneak
ing on behalf of the Government, admit
ted that the consensus of opinion was in
favor of some alteration of the law as
it exists at present. He was not opposed
to the second reading of the bill, but at
the same lime he thought that legisla
tion in that direction ought to be initiated
by the Government.
Pickersgili's motion for the second read
ing uf the bill was carried by a vote of 129
to 85.
BROTHERS FOUGHT A DUEL
Quarreled About a Girl, and One Is Dead
and the Other Badly
Wounded.
GREENSBURG, lND.,March 24â George
and Calvin Holmes, brothers, fought a
duel to the death near Moores Hill this
afternoon. The boys were twins and 22
years old. They ar3 members of a promi
nent and wealthy family. Miss Hieps,
over whom tney fought, is 20 ysars old
and the daughter of one of the wealthiest
families in the county.
About a year ago George Holmes began
baying his attentions to Miss Higgs and
he was favorably received. . Last Christ
mas his brother Calvin returned from col
lege and met the young lady at a neigh
borhood dance. They at once seemed
smitten with each other, and this aroused
the jealousy of the girl's lover. Nothing
was known of his feelings, however, until
Sundny night, when Miss Higgs jilted him
ior his brother. A quarrel ensued. This
afternoon the brothers met in the road.
They quarreled. and struck each other,
when Calvin fired. Several shots were
exchanged when George dropped dead.
Calvin is wounded over the heart.
DEATH OF DR. BURR.
He Designed the Monitor Which Ericsson
Improved With a Revolving
Turret.
DETROIT, Mich., March 24.â Dr. Theo
dore Burr died at his resid'-nce here this
morning, seed 81 years. His career was
varied and most interesting.
During the Mexican war he served
under General Winrield Scott and reached
the rank of colonel before peace was de
clared. During the Civil War he rendered
the North an inestimable service, for
which he received little or no considera
tion.
Plans for building an iron gunboat of
an entirely new style had been forming in
vis mind for some time, and the country's
great need caused him to hastily build a
model and carry it to Wasnington. The
steamer was constructed after Burr's
model, and when already for use was seen
by Join Ericsson, the famous inventor,
wno conceived the idea of improving it
with a revolving turret. Burr agreed to
the alteration, and the magnificent suc
censof the joint efforts of the two men is
a matter of world- wide fame.

Are Included. â ' ;
Â»
, f CHICAGO, III.;: March 24.â A1l rail- !
road traffic organizations in this city re- \
framed from transacting any business to- i
day which had to do wi(h the regulation !
of rates or division of business. Although
the executive officers and clerical forces at
the various Â«-. headquarters remained at
their desks, only routine business and
that which does not come within the ban
of the Supreme Court's decision, was at
tended to. â¢.
Ail toe associations are in a state of sus
pension, . "practically ' looking , over ! the
ground and waiting 1 , to rind out: where
they stand," as Chairman Caldwell of the
Western Passenger Association ex
pressed it. "â¢; ; '.â¢ â¢>'-.'-."; ,;:'
The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy
gave a sweeping ; notice of withdrawal to
day from membership in every freight and
passenger association, f? The general coun
sel of that* company advised the passen
ger officials not to affiliate with j other
roads.
: The notice includes the bureaus for the
issuance of mileage tickets and half-fare
clergy. permits, which, are departments of
the Western Passenger Association. At
the same time hit upon the plan of ap
pointing B. D. Caldwell, chairman of the
association, its agent to attend to clergy
permits and : mileage tickets, thus practi
cally retaining the association machinery
for the sake of economy and convenience.
This method of procedure will probably be
adopted by other roads which feel it in
cumbent upon themselves to sever all offi
cial relations with the associations. Such
action would mean that although the asso
ciations will be dissolved, In compliance
with the Supreme Court decision, the offi
cials and other employes of 'â â â  the organiza
tions j will be retained to attend to the
business which is not prohibited. The Bur
lington road also erased its name from all
joint ratesheets with all connecting lines.
The action of ; the Chicago, Milwaukee
and ; St. Paul . road to-day is, in effect, a
withdrawal from all freight and passenger
traffic associations. The official announce
ment was made that until the full text of
the decision was received and an opinion
has been rendered by the legal depart
ment the company will not participate in
any association. Its policy is that , inac
tion is equivalent to withdrawal, and,
therefore,; within legal bounds. It is a
question among railroad men whether the
mileage and clergy,;. bureaus come within
the scope of the decision. The Santa Fe
company did not enlarge on its action of ;
yesterday, limiting its withdrawal to I
freight associations. This limitation was !
decided upon in the opinion, which is
held by many able attorneys, that as the
anti-trust law is to prevent the restraint
of trade and commerce only the terms
cannot rightly .be applied to passengers !
and their transportation, which are not
commodities. ;;v^:>iÂ«: .
Vice- Chairman Parker of the Western
Freight Association's board of adminis
tration received notice to-day of the Min
neapolis and St. Ljuis road's withdrawal
from ail lreight associations. The mem
bers of the board of administration sat in
their offices reading the newspapers and
discussing the railroad situation as
printed therein. The fame condition of
inertia prevailed at the offices of the
Western and Transcontinental Passenger
associations. Commissioner Caldweil re
turned to-day fram Washington and New
York, and an important meeting was to
have been held, but the ofljcers of roads
who came discussed the mattes only in
formally and this, the chairman said,
would be a continuation of the informal
ity to-morrow. No business was likewi>e
transacted by Commissioners Donald and
Tucker Â«f the Central Passenger aud Cen
tral Freight associations, respectively.
FIVE CHILD HEN CREMATED.
Parents Attend a Religious Meeting and
on Returning Find their House in
Flames.
OTTUMWA, lowa, March 24â Flvejchil
dren of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Penrod, at
Laddsdale, a little mining town on the
Wapello and Davis County line, were
burned to death last night. Three were
cremated and two died a few hours later.
They are: Henry Penrod, aged 10 years;
John Penrod, aged 8 years; Minerva Pen
rod, aged 6 years; Ross Penrod, aged 4
years; Blame Penrod, aged 3 years.
The parents took the oldest child of the
family, a son aged 12, and a baby in the
arms of its mother, and went to a relig
ious meeting, having first nut the other
five children to bed. The scboolhouse,
wnere the services were held, was only
100 feet from the Penrod house. About 9
o'clock an alarm of fire was given and
Penrod, with the other occupants of the
sohoolbouse. rushed out to find his house
in flames.
It was impossible to enter the building
as it was crumbling when Penrod reached
it. The cnildren's bed was by theSvln
dow, however, and Penrod burst the win
dow open and succeeded in pulling the 8
and 4 year old toys out, horribly burning
himself m the act. The two never re
sained consciousness, however, and died
in a short time.
The others were burned until only a few
bones were found in the debris of the
house. The Coroner's inquest threw no
light on the oriein of the fire.

Adriee of Counsel.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 24âThe
board of managers of the Joint Traffic As
sociation, at its regular session ie-day, de
cided that in view of the uncertainty con
cerning the exact scope of the Supreme
Court's decision in the trans- Missouri
case, the Traffic Association should con
tinue in operation.
The determination to maintain the or
ganization was based not only on the
views of the several members of the board,
but on the advice of James C. Carter of
counsel for the association, who tnis
morning notified Commissioner Blanchard
that the full text of the Supreme Court
decision had not yet arrived, and until it
had been received and fully considered he
de mcd inadvisable any act looking to the
disruption of the association.

ENCOUNTERED A GALE
ON THE ATLANTIC.
Succor Came When the Crew
Had Given Up Hope of
Rescue.
WOBXED AT THE PUMPS UNTIL
EXHAUSTED.
-Signals of Distress Unobserved Until
Water Had Covered the
f Dicks.
BOSTON, Mass., March 24.âTwenty
seven happy men arrived in Boston har
bor 10-day, glad that they were still in the
land of the living. They were the rescued
crew of the ship Androsa, bound from
San Francisco to Liverpool, and to Cap
tain Wise of the Wilson line steamer On
tario they owe their lives.
It was a thrilling tale of a terrific storm,
of terrible su fferingt and of Â» brave res
cue from impending death that the sur
vivors told to a Call correspondent to
day. The dismantled ship was sighted
about 600 miles from their port. They
had been out 127 days on the voyage. The
Androsa carried the most valuable cargo
sent from San Francisco last year.
A hurricane struck the vessel on
March 2. It tore through the rigging,
stripped the yards and created havoc
generally. Then the hull sprantr a leak
and for six days the seamen worked the
pumps for thair lives. They kept tbe
water down pretty well until March 6,
when it began to gain at an alarming rate.
I'he pumna got clogged with grain, and
the faces of the men blanched with fear.
They did not know how much longer they
could keep the ship afloat, but they kept
at it. Signals of distress were displayed,
but for almost a week they were unob
served, and hope almost deserted the un
fortunate sailors.
Finally tne water arose to such extent
in the hold that the crew was forced to
Jeave the deck, which was soon awash.
The seamen look to the rigging. Their
dying hopa was revived and tneir joy was
indescribable when they saw the steamer
Ontario approaching. Their distress sig
naUb<iu been ieÂ«n and just in time. One
of the Ontario's boats was lowered, and
the Androsa's men were taken aboard.
After the rescue storm followed storm
until the good ship arrived in port this
morning. The logbook of the Ontario
shows that the passage must have been a
baa one, for tbe steamer left London on
I-uarch L The shipwrecked sailors were
in a horrible condition. Their hands and
feet bad become swollen, and they could
not get their boots off their feet.
"It was as fine a piece of work as I ever
saw in my life," said Captain Wise to a
Call correspondent, referring to the res
cue. ."We expected every minute to see
the boat overturned. The sea was growing
worse every minute. The waves were
mountain high, and we lost sight of the
boat between seas. Hurricane followed
hurricane so fast that we could hardly
keep track of them."
Captain Morgan of the lost vessel said
to a Call correspondent: "When the
leak was discovered we fastened the crew
to the pumps with bow lines around each
man, and as only the weather handle of a
pump could be utilized we attached a bell
rope to the handle so that more men
could work at once. A part of the crew
continued jettisoning the cargo, and, be
ing unable to leave their work for fear the
vessel would founder, they had no nour
ishment for two days and nights. The
men were fast becoming helpless. Their
feet were swollen to double their normal
size, and some were unable to bear their
weight upon them.
"As soon as the men became to ex
hausted to work the pumps they were
lifted Delow and given nourishment, and
upon their recovering sufficiently were
lilted back to their position at the pumps,
as they were unable to stand on their feet.
It became a question of a lew hours when
the vessel would founder, as it was rap
idly sinking and the weak efforts of the
crew at the pumps seemed to have do
effect in keeping the water down. The
Ontario came just in the nick of time."
The names of the rescued are: Captain
David Morgan, First Mate William Elli
son, Second Mate David Evans, Boat
swain Hans Olenavens, Steward W. Tenia
Â»on and Seamen G. A. Tillman, H. M-yer,

laden with a micellaneous cargo, mostly
ilry roods. Its owners were E. T. and F.

built. Is gross tonr.age was 1892 tons.
The Androsa was one of the stanchest
(hips .hat caiue to this port, and Captain
Morgan is known as a most careful ma

BLANTHER RESTS
UNDER THE SOD
The Body of the Suicide-
Murderer Buried at
Meridian.
Detective Gibson Takes Charge
of His Trunks and Their
Contents.
Story of a Cruel Dssertion Told by
the Putative Wife of the
Ncb'.eman.
MERIDIAN, Tex., March 24.â Detective
Gibson arrived here this morning at 6
o'clock, and accompanied by G. A. Dodge
went at once to the County Jail to view
the body of Joseph E. Blanther, acting
under instructions from Chief of Detec
tives Lees of San Francisco. Three pho
tographs of the dead murderer were taken
in tbe yard of the jail.
The articles of ciothing identified by
Dodge as having been seen on Blanther in
San Francisco were taken possession of
by the California officers.
Two trunks arrived from Clebnrne, Tex.,
where they had been checked by Blanther.
His ticket was also turred over to the
detective.
Both trunks were opened at the Sheriff's
office and the contents examined. In one
trunk was nothing but the effects of a
woman who passed for a few months as
Blanther's wife.
The other, a well-worn leather trunk,
was filled with all imaginable kinds of
articles, but nothing that could identify
tbe dead man as Blanther. All the col
lars and shirts and other articles were
marked with the initials, "A. F. X.,"
evidently for Arthur Forbes Kopperl.
The most interesting thing found in t&e
trunk was a small phial, which had con
tained about ten grains of morphine tab
lets. This was empty.
It was reported on the street that De
tective Gibson was seen to find a small
box which had been carefully concealed
in some clothing, and to quickly examine
the contents and then put it into nis pock
et. He also obtained, it is said, some
photos of women showing that Blanther
had been in Georgia.
The statement of Homer Randal and
John Womack, the men who made the ar
rest, were taken to-day. The body of the
murderer and suicide was turned over to
Gibson and Dodge, who gave a receipt
for it
The officers from California then gave
direction? for the burial of the corpse,
and at 2:30 o'clock the coffin was lowered
into the grave. With a pencil Dodge
marked on the wooden headboard:
â¢ JOSEPH K. BLANTHER :
(Alias Arthur Forbes).
Died March 22, 1897.
Then, with a last look, as he silently
turned away, Dodge said:
"Poor Blantherl I was the only
mourner he had, after all."
Detective Gibson and G. A. Dodge left
at 5:20 o'clock for Ban Francisco in charge
of Blanther's trunk and contents.
Blanther's only dread after his capture
was to meet the California officers. The
supposition is that he had mor
phine tablets concealed in his
clotbing when placed in jail, and was pre
pared to take his life rather than return
to California. He made no confession,
but repeatedly asked if the California of
ficers had come.
BljA.y THE It's DESERTED WIFE.
the Declare* Ber lirlief in Her Hus
band's Innocence.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., March 24.â Mrs.
Agnes Forbes, who has been in the city
since a year ago last June, was separated
at Atlanta from Blanther, who, she says,
was her husband. She is now on Her way
to Meridian, Tex., to take charge of the
body, having left on Monday night on the
receipt of a telegram from the San Fran
cisco Chief of Police notifying her of her
alleged husband's approacniug death.
She merely gave out to her friends here
that she was intending to visit friends in
Atlanta, Ga., but the local Chief of Police,
who has been in communication with the
Chief of Detectives in San Francisco, re
vealed the woman's identity.
A year ago a strange woman arrived in
the city and announced that she was pen
niless and, having been deserted by her
husband, waa determined to make her own
livelihood. Sue became the agent for face
cosmetics and rented a room first at 28
Robinson street, tnen at 96 Mobile street
and later at 308 Scott street. She seemed
to prosper in her business and the women
of the city, to whom she tola pitiful sto
ries, sympathized wiihher and financially
aided tier.
In Jnne, 1896, shortly after the death of
Mrs. Lincfeid, Mrs. Forbes called on
Chief Geral.l, who heid a circular offering
a reward for the capture of Ulanther. She
said she was in search of Arttiur Forbes
LavenJe Vrecourt, her husband, and she
displayed his photograph And described
THE SAN FRAK CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 1897.
him. The Chief was astonished at the
resemblance between the picture he held
of Joseph Blanther and that of Forbes,
and when he showed the Blanther photo
graph to the woman Â»' c pronounced it
that of her husband. She refused to re
linquish the photograph. Subsequently
Mrs. Forbes wrote to the San Francisco
police regarding the matter, saying the
description and age corresponded with
that of her recent husband. She was mys
tihed only in the names, She said:
"If Blanther is his real name he mar
ried me under an alias. My name was
Agnes Cameron, and I was married to
Forbes at Little Rocfc, Ari;., December 18,
1892."
She said she would swear to the medals.
He kept them in a tin box, together with
the Emperor's seal and royal telegrams.
Her husband had gone by the name of
A. D. Forbes in Atlanta, where he was in
business. She said he was good and true
until the Atlanta Expo-ition, when he
became infatuated with a woman named
Add;e Harper, whom she had reason since
to believe was Mrs. Langfeld. In her let
ter she i-iivs her husband would not
wantonly kill, and she believed there waÂ«
a mystery in the murder.
"Purely," she added, "be would not slay
for $600 worth of diamond!."
Since tbe day ot her interview with
Chief Gerald she has assiduously devoted
herself to business, but the polica have
shadowed her at the request of the San
Francisco authorities, who were sanguine
that her husband would walk into a trap
by returning to the woman he deserted.
Sue attributed his ruin to wine and
women, but she loved him dearly. The
woman was a member of the First Baptist
Church in this city.
GREAT PIGEON SHOOT.
Dr. Carver, Tom Marsha// and Henry Zee
Lead With a Tie Score of Tweniy-
One Birds Each.
LONG BRANCH, X. J., March 24.â
Elkwood Park not only claims the dis
tinction of being the finest shooting
grounds in the world, but has the honor
of being the scene the best pigeon
shooting match known in the history of
the world.
The match referred to ia the great
American handicap, which commenced at
10 o'clock this morning with 146 entries.
1 his is the largest number of shots ever
competing in any single match. Eleven
oi the entries who paid their $25 entrance
fee forfeited. These were Ben Cooper, T.
M. Farmer, T. D. Hooper, J. Wort, J. H.
Shafer, "Chicago," M. M. McMillin, Sim
Glover, A. H. Sherman, A. S. Hunter and
W. H. Banders. No reason was given for
their withdrawal.
Tho match could not be finished to-day
on account of the darkness. Twenty-one
rounds bad been shot at 6 o'clock, when
it was decided to discontinue and shoot
off the remaining four rounds to-morrow
morning. Dr. W. F. Carver of Chicago,
Tom Marshall and Henry Zee, of Newark,
are tie with clean scores of 21 each. Over
a dozen men are tie for second place.
When the first squad of marksmen went
to the traps this morning it was raining
quite hard. Shortly before noon the sun
ca me out, to the satisfaction and joy of
all. During the afternoon a brisk wind
blew across the grounds. Irby Bennet
was the first to lose his bird, a right
driver. J. G. Messner, who was looked
upon by many an a winner, had the same
luck. The next to miss was G. E. Grieff,
and after him came "Old Hobs" Hostetter
of Pittsburg.
When the ninth round was finished
thirty-five contestants nad clean scores.
In the next three rounds the number
dropped to twenty -five. The greatest
number of misses were made from the
No. 2 trap. This faces exactly south and
caught the fui! benefit of the wind.
Connie Ferguson, tr.e 15-year-old son of
Cornelius Ferguson Jr. oi Brooklyn, was
the star attraction of the handicap until
he was compelled to drop out in the sev
enteenth round.
6. B. Dickey, the winner of last year's
handicap, lias twenty kills to his credit.
His only miss was in the fourteenth
round, when a left quarterer got away
from him.
With three tied for first money !on the
twenty- round there is considerable
speculation as to who will be the winner.
Dr. Carver, on account of bis past record,
is thought to have the best chance, but
Marshall and Zee may surprise him.
Following is a list of' those who re
mained when shooting was discontinued

FEATHER-WEIGHTS
FIGHT ONCE MORE
Champion George Dixon
Wins the Decision From
Frank Erne.
Colored Lad Cuts Out the Pace
All Through Twenty-
Four Rounds.
It is Give ani Take in the Wind-
Upâ -Erne Over Weight, and
Forfeits $500.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 24.â Frank
Erne of Buffalo met George Dixon, the
colored feather-weight champion, for the
second time at the Broadway Athletic
Club to-night. Dixon got the decision
without the shadow of cavil. Dixon was
himself to-night and he did air the lead
ine up to the twenty-first round. Erne
stayed away and scarcely landed three
good blowa until the twenty-first round.
Dixon fought differently from his
usual style. He was more cautious and
tried hard to pet Erne to lead, but the
Buffalo lad appeared afraid and sluggish
and he kept strictly away until after the
twentieth round. Then he made a des
perate effort to knock his man out, but
failed utterly.
The preliminary was to have been a
twelve-round bout between two colored
middle-weights, Lon Beckwith of Cleve
land and George Beyers of Boston, but
Beyers had his man groggy after two
minutes and eight seconds of the fifth
round and the referee stopped the bout.
There were 4000 Mpectatoa present when
Erne and Dixou appeared. Dixon
weighed 121J^ pounds and Erne scaled
130>j when they were weighed at noon to
day. Tom O'Kourke wanted to call the
match off, but Dixon wished to light and
Erne forfeited $500. The betting was
even. Dixon's Beconds were Tom
O'Rourke, Joe Elms and Charley Miner,
while Erne was looked afier by "Brook
lyn" Jimmy Carroll, Frank Zimpher and
Sam CalJaghan.
Before the men shook hands Tom
O'Rourke addressed the spectators and
declared, as manager of the club, tnat ail
bets were off, as Erne was over weight,
but the reieree announced tnat all bets
made after the weiguts were declared
stooa.
. There was little work done in the first
round. After a minute's sparring Dixon's
left found the eye, Erne countering on the
body. More sparring followed and George
led again, but Erne clinched. Erne's left
reached the jaw lightly in the second,
George countering on the heart.
George opened tue third with a left over
the ear and a moment later sent the ; left
hard on the nose and had the best of the
fighting that followed. Dixon rushed, but
was stopped with a left on the body. Erne
swung a left on the jaw, George counter
ing hard on the wind. Just as the , bell
rang George sent a bard right on the
nose. .' : v.;- i ' ".\."'
In the fourth George sent his left strong
on the nose and repealed it a moment
later. After a lot of sparring George shot
his left to the jaw. Erne stopped a hard
swing cleverly and they were sparring
when the bell rang.
George was fighting cautiously, but
doing ali the leading. Dixon knocked his
man's head clear back with a left in the
tilth and then put right and left on both
aides of the jaw. Dixon waited for Erne
to lead, but he would not, and men
George hammered him on the jaw and
body. Erne warmed up toward the close
and put a couple of straight lefts on
Dixon' s face.
In tue sixth Dixon went on the aggres
sive with a light left, after which he
smashed a right on the body and followed
with a left nook on the neck. Then
George smashed a straight left on the
lace and repeated it a moment later, Erne
countering on the body. Dixon kept
cutting out the pace in tue seventh and
did all the work. Both tried swinging in
the eighth, but were wild. Dixon used a
goud straight left with effect and punished
hia man on the wind.
Brne-'p left found the chin with great
force in the ninth. Dixon put a hard lelt
on the wind and swung his riglit to the
face. Erne led twice in the tentn but was
short on the first and the second went over
George's head. The eleventh was mainly
devoted to sparring.
Dixon was a bit careless on the opening
of the twelfth and just escaped a fearful
swing for the jaw. 'ihe blow just grazed
and nearly staggered George. Tne colored
boy came back with telling force on the
body. Erne put a good right on the body,
but Dixon retaliated with a hard left on
the body and then came again with bis
left on the jaw. Both were fresh when
the bell sounded half the journey.
George cut loose in the thirteenth round
ana landed a shower of blows on body
and jaw. Erne countered on the nose,
and after a mix-up George sent a fearful
right on the pit of the stomach that
nearly doubled Erne up. The round was
all Dion's.
Dixon got right to work in the four
teenth with a right and left on head and
body. Then Geor.'e staggered his man
witn a left flush on the face.
Erne met a rush with a hard one on the
mouth in the rkteenth, and then Frank
shot a left in for a right on the neck. Dix
on shot a hot left to the neck in the six
teenth, but Frank counterea sharply.
George then landed on the eye.
Dnon staggered hia man with a hard
Jelt swing on the jaw in the seventeenth
and had Erne on the run for a second, but
the Buffalo boy recovered quickly, and
was lighting when the bell rang.
George started the nineteenth with a
couple of smashes on the face. Dixon
kept up the attack. Erne not attempting
to lead until just as the bell rang, when
they exchanged lefts with free hands in a
clinch. Dixon smashed three lefts in the
face without a return in the twentieth.
Erne leu twice alter the opening of the
twenty-first, but was wild, and George
smashed him twice. Erne swung a hard
right for a knock out, but the blow caught
George on the back of the neck and only
turned him around. Erne tried desper
ately with the right in the twenty-second
and upper-cut George twice with the right.
Dixon smashed in three or four on the
face, and punched his right twice on the
body in a clinch in the twenty-third.
In the twenty-fourth, as George rushed
in Erne countered on the left eye.
Erne led with a left and swung it on top
of George's head, whereat the colored lad
smiled and drove a left over the heart.
Dixon came in with a lett on the wind for
the last round. Erne fiddled a Jot and
George caught him a aoatcer on the ribs,
repeating it later amid cheers. Erne sent
a hard right to the heart, but George came
back hard on the ear. Again Erne drove
a left on the rib) and they came together
fora h'erce rally, both exchanging hard
punches before the bell rang. There were
loud cries for Dixon, and when the referee
decided in his favor there was not a
dissenting voice.

BY THIS DECISION
Hundreds of Divorcees in
Washington Declared
Criminals.
Remarried Within Six Months
After Obtaining Their
Decrees.
Laft the State to Evade a Peculiar
Law, bat the Precaution Was
Futile.
TACOMA, Wash., March 24. â The
statute in this State prohibiting a person
from marrying within six months after he
or she has obtained a divorce was to-day
decided by Judge Kean to hold good not
only within the limits of the State, but
outside its limits. The question was de
cided in the Marquardt case, the court fol
lowing the line of reasoning laid down by
the State Supreme Court in re me Smith
estate, in 4 Washington.
In that case the doctrine is advanced
that, where a divorce is granted with a
prohibition against the remarriage of
either of the parties until after the ex
piration of six months from the date of
the decree, while the divorce is absolute
and complete in all other respects, yet on
the question of the right of remarriage
the decree will be considered as held in
suspension during the six months, and
not to take effect to that extent until the
time has expired.
With tnis view of the case, Judge Kean
announced that as the person was for the
time incapacitated to marry and did not
have the legal capacity to contract a mar
riage, an attempted marriage was void,
and the rule that a marriage legal and
valid in the jurisdiction where contracted
remained legal everywhere did not apply.
The announcement of Judge Kean's de
cision has caused a sensation among all
classes, since its effect must be to invali
date scores of marriages in every county
in the State. At Tacoma, Spokane and
Seattle alone the number will reach hun
dreds. Under the laws the obtaining of
divorces in Washington is comparatively
easy, and while this fact has not been
generally advertised many persons have
come from outside States to obtain mari
tal separations. Many of these have been
from Oregon, but others have come from
as far East as New York.
While divorced persons have been care
ful to abstain from re-entering wedlock
during the prescribed six months within
this State, it has been the custom of those
desiring to remarry to go to Victoria,
B. C, or Portland, Or., and carry out their
plans. Frequently persons have been
divorced here one day and married out
side the State the next. These are the mar
riages now declared illegal. Large prop
erty rights are ttius affected, and many
children are judicially determined to be
illegitimate.

A LITTLE
BOY WINS
A FORTUNE
William Gridley Toland
Will Have an Equal
Share.
WORTH ONE HUNDRED
THOUSAND.
Judge Buckles Declares That the
Trust in the Toland Will
Is Invalid.
AND THE BOY WILL TAKE ONE
HALF THE ESTATE.
A Decision of Mora than Ordinary
Interest to Lawyers and the
G?neral Public.
FAIRFIELD, Cal., March 24.â William
Gridley Toland, the bright little grandson
of the late Mrs. H. A. Toland, has won a
fortune.
Judge Buckles of this county so decided I
to-day, and the boy will share equally I
WILLIAM GRIDLEY TOLAND, the Little Boy Who Has Won
a .Fortune.
with Hugo Toland the estate left by his
grandmother, consisting of about 3500
acres* near Toland Landing, in Solano
County, and valued at about $200,000.
Master Toland, who is now in New York j
with his mother, commenced suit by his j
guardian, Samuel M. Shortridge, in this I
county, to recover one-half of this rich
estate.
The case, the decision of which gives
this youthful litigant a handsome fortune,
had been pending for several months be
fore Judge A. J. Buckles of that county.
It will be remembered that Mrs. If. B.
Toland, widow of the ia;e Dr. Toland, died
several years ago at the Occidental Hotel
in San Francisco and left a document pur
porting to be her will, in which she under
took to dispose of her estate.
Hnd she died without leaving a will, her
son Hu^o and her grandson William
Gridiey would have inherited the estate
share and share alike. It was with con
siderable surprise that the announcement
was made that 3he had left to her little
grandson only $2000 of her vast estate.
Owing to the fact that the boy is the
grand-nephew of Samuel M. Shortridge,
tbat gentleman caused himself to be ap
pointed his guardian and instituted pro
ceedings to contest the validity of the al
leged will.
Mr. Shortridge contended that the will
undertooK to create a trust and that
the trust was void, and to test
this point he filed a suit in
this county in which he alleged
that William Gndley Toland was one of
the two heirs-at-*law of Mrs. Toland, and,
as such, was the owner of an undivided
half of the big Toland ranch.
This suit was similar to that commenced
by Charles Fair to test the trust clause in
the Fair will.
The executors and legatees under the
alleged will of Mrs. Toland were repre
sented by several firms of lawyers. Wil
son & Wilson represented Grace Episcopal
Church, which claimed a $500 legacy ; Major
John B. Mhoon represented certain
brothers and two deceased sisters of Mrs.
Toland and E. B. and George H. Masticfc
represented those who were given lega
cies, as well as the executors.
The matter was submitted to Judge
Buckle 3 last December, and he has just
rendered an opinion sustaining
the position taken by the guardian
of younz Master Toland, and
holding that the trust attempted to be
created by Mrs. Toland was utterly void,
and tnat the grandson was entitled to half
tbe property.
In the course of a learned opinion on
the subject of trusts, on the demurrer in
terposed by the plaintiff to the answers of
the defendants on the motion 10 strike out
the answers as shown, Judge Buckles said:
Opinion sustaining demurrer to all the an
swers and granting motion to strike out.
This is a suit to quiet title.
Piaintiff claims title to one-half of certain
real estate as the heir of Mary B. Toland, de
ceased, and alleging that the defendants claim
some interest thereiu.
All tbe defendants answering: deny that the
plaintiff has any interest in said land except
such as he acquires under the will of said
Mary B. Tolund, and defendants set up claim
ol title under said will also in their second,
separate and further defense. The demurrer
Is to the second cause of defense set up In
answer, and i* on the grounds that it does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a delense.
The will provides as follo\vs:
'â¢Should my death occur before the expira
tion oi the leases of my ianilei estate, I desire
the firm oi E. B. Mastick Esq. and his part
ners to receive all rents. So soon as the leases
oi rented lands aro canceled I desire the land
to be sold, high lands and tules, with all im
provements, to the best advantage. Hugo
Huger Toland (my son) to receive one-half of
the money."
If this creates a trust then it is a device in
restraint of nb'oluto alienation. A trust is on
equitable obligation, and is either express or
may be implied, resting upon a person by rea
son of a coutiatMico reposed in him, to appiy or
deal with property for the bencfli of another.
The will produces abundant proof that the
testatrix had great confidence in Mastiek and
his partners.
So much confidence did she repose in them
that she left all minor details of the execu
tion of her will to them. She intended they
should collect the rents due on the leases and
account for such rents. Sine provided for giv
ing Masiiok $1000. and declared that his firm
should b3 liberally corupsnsated for its legal
services in settling the estate.
Evidently the testatrix's relations with the
firm were very coulideutial. I think there can
be no doubt but what she intended the rents
should be accounted for. The obligation
rested upon MÂ« stick and partners lor the bene
fit of the devisi e,v The power to collect and
receive renis constitute tue person so ap
pointed a trustee, and the instrument by
which his appointment is made a trust, and it
would seem to be wholly unnecessary to use
tte words "trust" and "trustee."
The testatrix evidently intended that her
rents should be collected until the termina
tion of the leases, when the lands should be
sold and the proceeds applied as she had
directed. She thus imposed upon .Masticlt
and partners the obligation of carrying out
her wishes. It is evident, also, that she never
intended to give her heirs any interest what
ever in her real property.
I am unable to discover any real difference
in principle between this will and the one
Msaad upon in the estate of Waikerloy, 108
Cal., 629. In the latter a specific mention
was nuide ot a "trust," and trustees were ap
pointed and named as trustees. The real
estate was devised to them to be managed
and to pay from the income certain devisees,
and at tne end ol twenty-Jive years, at least, to
sell all the trust estate and distribute the
proceeds.
In the Toland will the testatrix directed
that Masiick collect the rents of her real estate
then under leases until the expiration of the
leases, fnd then tin; land was to be sold and
the proceeds distributed. Presumably tho
leases terminated at a fixed and definite time,
and before which time no alienation could be
made any more than could be made in the
Waikerley estate before the expiration of the
twenty-live years.
But k is argueu hero that trustee, lessee and
heirs could unite in conveyance at any time
and thereby make an absolute alienation of
the property; or the trustee and heirs could
join in a conveyance subject to the leasts.
But the complete answer to this seems to mo
to be that In the first instance the trust of
collecting the rents would be destroyed, and
therefore defeat the intent of the trus'tor.
In the second Instance, while the convey
ance mentioned would destroy the trust also,
the law provides that tne right of alienation
which cannot be suspended is the absolute
right, whicn I understand to include posses
sion, and If the trustee and heirs should join
in a conveyance subject to the lease that
would not be an absolute alienation.
It therefore follows that the portion of the
will creating tUe trust referred to is void and
constitutes no defense to the action of plain
tiff to quiet his title.
For tue reason* herein ptated, the demurrer
to the answers should be sind Is sustained.
Tiie motion to strike out the lirst defense of
the answers is allowed and all that portion of
the answers is stricken out.
A. J. Buckles, Judge.
March 23, 1897.
It will be observed that Judge Buckles
bases his decision on the Walkerley case,
which came up from Oakland several
years a-:o. The present decision is one of
much interest on the subject of trusts
and shows liow difficult it is to draw a
trust v,-!iicli will stand the test of the
technical law bearing on this subject.
Although the decision of the court
wipes out the legacy to Grace Church, Mr.
Shortridge said, speaking on behalf of his
ward, that thoutrh the will goe* by the
board he is willing, and so is hig mother,
to pay whatever legacies may be provided
in the will for Grace Church, and to con
tribute money to keep up tha Toland
masoleum in Laurel Hill Cemetery.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 1897.
HON. P. B. TULLY
DIES AT GILROY.
The Ex-Congressman Passes
Away After a Long
Illness.
Was a Pioneer of California
and a Leader of the
Democracy.
First G lined State^Wide Fame As
Counsel for Vasquez and
Moreno.
QILROf, Cal., March LM.-Hon. Pleas
ant B. Tully. ex-Congressman of the Fifth
District, died this evening at his home in
this city alter a long illness. He was a
pioneer of this valley, having arrived here
in tne early fifties. He married Mary A.,
daughter of the late pioneer, J ulius Martin.
Pleasant 15. Tully was a native of Hen
derson County, Term., born March 121,
1829. He completed his education at
Reel's Academy in 1849. In 1859 he was
elected Justice of the I'eace of Giiroy
Township and commenced the study of
law. He was admitted to practice in 1803.
As a criminal lawyer he gained local re
nown, and as the counsel of Outlaw Vas
quez and the noted Jesus Moreno his fame
became State wide.
In 1879 Mr. Tully was elected a delegate
at large on the Non-Partisan ticket to the
constitutional convention and in that
capacity maintained his character for
firmness and high principle. Throughout
his life he had been a consistent Democrat
and in the last campaign, when Eugene
Deuprey delivered an address *here, he
acted as chairman of the meeting, receiv
ing a flattering ovation. In 1882 he was
elected to Congress from the .fifth Dis
trict and served his constituents with
honor to himself and his party. He was
versed in the intricacies of law, was an
eloquent and forcible speaker and a deep
thinker and had a profound knowledge of
the science of political economy.
In later years Mr. Tully had retired to
private life, and during the past live years
he had not been a well man. His advice
was always sought in all legal matters and
by politicians. .As a leader of the Dem
ocracy he was a great power in this end of
the county.
Mr. Tuily leaves a wife and two chil
dren, Lizzie P., the wife of Hamilton J.
Ricgins of Ban Francisco, and Mary Lee,
tue wife cf Supervisor George E. Rea. The
news of his death was expected, as he had
bee-i failing rapidly tho past two weeks,
but it has cast a gloom over the ciiy. The
funeral will be conducted by Keith Lodge,
P. and A. M., No. 187, of which he was a
charter member.
LOSES T A CO MA PROPERTY.
Â£j'ec!ment Suit Decided Against the
Pacific Bank of San
Francisco.
TACOMA, Wim., March 24.â The
Pacific Bunk of San Frar Cisco has received
a reminder of the fact that the law is
mighty uncertain. It recently commenced
ejectment proceedings against Dolph
Hannah and his wife to remove them
from the possession of four acres of
valuable land in the heart cf the city of
Tacorna, in what is known as the "Niger
tract." It did so as owner in fee under a
deed from Frank V. McDonald, whose
title to tho property had been established
by the Federal court a year ago in par
tition proceediugs brought by him as
purchaser from Mrs. Mary A. Givens, the
widow of James H. Givens, who died in
testate in 1873, without heirs.
In the partition suit by McDonald
every one interested except the county of
Pierce was made a party. It was not sup
posed that the county could have any
interest.
In the ejectment suit Hannah set up
a claim of the county as owner under the
law of escheat, claiming occupancy by
consent of the county. Ii transpires that
Givens and wife were Massachusetts peo
ple. They never lived here and had no
community rights. The wife had only a
dower interest, terminating at her death.
They could convey nothing to McDonald,
consequently the bank has no litlo.
Judge Handforu so decides, and judg
ment is so entered.
The Commissioners of the county, not
thinking the county's claim worth any
thing, entereil into an agreement wuh
Hannah that he should defend under the
claim of the county and if successful get
three acres out of the four. The Com
missioners are now kicking themselves.
The property must be worth at present
prices $20,000.

SAN ANSEL/HO ACCIDENT.
Car-Repairer Daniel Whaley Seriously
Injured by ihe Explosion of a
Railroad Lantern.
SAN ANSELMO, Cal., March 24.â
By the explosion of an ordinary railroad
lantern over tha flame of which he was
as usual holviing and warming a can of
thick lubricating oil, Daniel Whaley, a
car-repairer 51 years of age, was knocked
senseless this forenoon about 9:30 o'clock.
Cut about the right temple and uncon
scious, he was placed upon a mattress,
put on the fir<it passing train, and borne
to his home and family in Sausalito. At
first his condition was thought to be
ciitical and Dr. Mays and Dr. Crompton
were hastily summoned. He soon re
covered consciousness, however, and dur-
injt the afternoon, though still under the
physician's care, was completely out of
danger and with the prospect of being
able to resume work in a day or two.
The accident occurred juss outside a
toolhouse about a hundred yards west of
the station. Charlie Bottarini, a wood
sawyer in the employ of the railroad
company, was the first arrival of those
attracted to the scene by the pnn-liKe
explosion. He found Wlialey leaning
against the building, bleedine, speechless,
and slowly sinking to the ground.
Whaley is a man of lar^e family and
has been in the employ of the railroad
company hereabouts for eighteen years.
COAL FROM CORRAL HOLLOW.
First Consignment Arrives at Stockton
Over the New Railway From
the Mines.
STOCKTON, Cal., Marcn 24.-The first
coal brought from Corral Hollow to Stock
ton arrived late this afternoon. The con
signment, included ten carloads. The first
carload went to th' Hoit Manufacturing
Company of this city, which has had an
order placed for coal ever since the com
mencement of the road that now connects
Stockton with the niiues. Two others
went to Manager Adams of the Stockton
Gas and E'ectnc Company.
Tha advent in this city of the .coal from
the great mines in the Hollow, and which
promises to cheapen so much the cost of
manufacturing here, was the occasion of a
demonstration on the part of the coal
dealers. Nearly every one of the local
dealers was on hand to get some of the
coal in order to enable householders here
to try it ana demonstraie its qualities.
The company has not yet made public its
rates, but has always said they would be
very low- close upon $4 a ton to the house
holders here and very much lower to
manufacturers using large quantities.

SUES FOR LAND NEAR NILES.
Aged C/'arkson Start Deeded His Property
io His Brother and Wants
It Back.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 24.â Clarkson
Start began suit in the Superior Court yes
terday to establish nis ownership of sixty
three acres of land lying on the road from
Nileu to Haywaids, in Alameda County.'
The story told in the complaint empha
sizes the uncertainty of life and deatti. In
1893 Clarkson Start was an old man in
feeble health, and his brother, George H.
Start, was younger and in robust health.
Clarkson. says he believed George would
outlive him, and he entered into an agree
ment, on November 18, whereby he con
veyed the land in question to George in
trust for himself and his heirs in order to
avoid the necessity of administration
upon his death, Georae agreeing to care
for the property and carry out the wishes
of Clarkson. In June, 1896, with the con
sent of Clarkson, an undivided one-fourth
interest in the property was sold to Joseph
Silva Louiz for $2350, which money George
agreed to pay over to Clarkson upon de
mand. He neglected to do so, and on Oc
tober _'l ne died, leavine Clarkson's affairs
in a somewhat muddled condition.
The plaintiff states that he was loaned
various sums of money by George between
November, 1893, and the date of the latter's
death, and he wants the court to adjust the
entire matter. The defendants in the ac
tion are Mary S." C. Start, administratrix
of the estate of George H. Start, and Jo
seph Silva Louiz, who he asks be required
to interpleud and litigate their claim.-.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 24.-Col
lls P. Huntington, accompanied by H. E.
"Huntington and wife, Vice-President
John C. Stubbs, General Manager Krutt
schriitt,'J.D. Miller and others, arrived
here in a special train from Washington
this afternoon.' They went at once to
Santa Monica.'
As usual Mi. Huntington was affable,
but he maintained his old-time attitude
of reticence regarding his future policy.
In fact he seemed to know less regarding
San Pedro than any other subjectâ at
least ho wanted to give this impression.
He said that he did not propose to com
bat the location of the harbor at San
Pedro, but it was said in such a way as to
leave considerable doubt as to his real in
tentions in the premises.
''Mr. Huntington," asked a reporter,
"we would like to ask you something
about San Pedro Harbor."
"Weil," replied the railroad magnate in
the most jovial manner, "what is there
new about it? Is there anything? Tell
me. I have not kept posted lately."
"The papers say that you intend to
fight against the decision of the Harbor
Board."
"The report of the commission is in the
hands of the department at Washington,
and I certainly do not run the Govern
ment. I have not even read the report.
Tell me," he asked, "what does it say?
No, there is reaily nothing to be said,"
concluded the gentleman.
"But can you not say something about
your intentions regarding the harbor, and
if you propose righting against the report
of the commission being carried into exe
cution?"
"I never fight anything. I am one of
the best-natured fellows in the world.
No, J am not opposing anything."
BISHOP MONTGOMERY LECTURES.
"Indulgences" the Subject of a Discourse
Delivered by the Catholic
Prelate,
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 24.â The
second lecture under the auspices of the
Catholic Truth Society, at the Los Ange
les Theater, was delivered by Bishop
Montgomery to-night upon the subject of
"Indulgences."
"The fundamental truths underlying
all Christian doctrine," said the Bishop'
"are these â redemption and salvation.
Redemption and salvation are related
closely, but are not identical. .Redemp
tion may exist without salvation, but sal
vation never exists without being pre
ceded by ledempiion.
"The Catholic doctrine is that Christ re
deemed all men and wishes all men to be
saved, and he provided the means with
which men may be saved. He likewise
made a system of salvation, and instituted
an organization into whose hands he
placed those means. When we transfer
red our allegiance from God to Satan we
became spiritually bankrupt, and Christ
came to redeem us from our liabilities,
but made the application conditional.
That application of redemtion becomes
salvation. Christ redeemed all, but indi
vidually saved none. The New Testament
everywhere shows that we are to work out
our own salvation.
"An 'indulgence' is the remission of tem
poral punishment due to sin, after the sin
itself hasiaeen remitted. It is not pardon
or absolution of sin, but a lightening ol
the temporal punishment dua to sin."

3 THE CALL SPEAKS FORWON BOTH FAME
AND FORTUNE
Remarkable Success That
Attended Two Texas
Attorneys.
Easiness Sagacty and Integrity
Rewarded Beyond Fond
est Hopes.
A Driak Cure That Brought Honor
and Opu'ence to Men of Pluck
and Enterprise.
One of the moat remarkable business
successes achieved in recent years falls to
the credit of T. Â£. Cowart, formerly an
attorney of San Antonio, Texas. His
work is the more noteworthy in that it
has accomplished roach for the moral
improvement and happiness of his fellow
man.
While preparing for his departure for
Honolulu on the steamer Australia at the
Qeand Hotel on Tuesday, he condescended
to tell -something of his unusual ex
periences in connection with his enter
prise to a representative of The Call.
While engaged in the practice of law at
San Antonio, in partnership with Mr.
Kirkpatrick, be had called to his attention
rthe remark :ble efficacy of the Hagey
formula for the cure of the drinking and
morphine habits. After making a
thoroueh investigation of the matter, he
bought the right to use the same from Dr.
F. A. Sutphen. Associated with him in
his new 'departure was his then partner,
Mr. Kirkpatrick. They came to Cali
fornia, and chose San Jose as their first
field of operation. They organized an
institute there about four years ago, after
enlisting the sympathies and co-cperation
of some of the beat people of the Garden
City.
They incorporated a stock company with
a capital of $100,000. The cures that they
effected there more than met their fond
est anticipations. Many of the people
whom they treated are now filling impor
tant positions. Previous to the advent of
the institution theÂ«e same men had been
given up by even their deaie^t friends and
relatives, and were virtually social
pflriahs>, and goin? more and more rap
idly to complete degradation and destruc
tion.
What greatly aided tbe*e gentlemen to
accomplish the great work they had un
dertaken, and which soon gave them fame
nnd fortune, was the strict business prin
ciples they adopted and faithfully pur
sued. . Every applicant was given a guar
antee of being absolutely cured. "No
cure, no pay" was their motto, and in no
instance did they give any one cause of
compjarnt.
Later they went to Los Angeles and or
ganized a Cure Institute there, with the
same success that bad attended their
efforts at San Jose. They also operated
m other portions of the State, and always
with the same gratifying results.
After a period of unaualified success in i
this Stat- Messrs. Cowart and Kirkpatrick
sought foreign fields. They left for Hon- I
T. E. Cowart.
oiaiu and there established another suc
cessful institute, interesting with them
such weil-known men as W. R. Castle. L.
V. Abies, Alexander Young, J. Alfred Mc-
Goon, P. C. Jones, Mr. Atherton and many
others. The institute was opened there
the 2<t of November, and since that time
they have ireatpd more than 100 cases,
. with the invariable success that followed
tripm-ol?e-where.
Mr.. Cow;rt's object in coming to this
City at this timÂ« was to secure the right
â¢of the Hagfy cure lor Africa. This ne
succeeded, in doing. Realizing the great
importance ol the new projt-ct be proposed
to engase in, Mr. Cowan, before consum
mating matters, telegraphed to Judge W.
G, Kuckerof Groesbeck, Tex., to come on
and assist in closing up the deal. He met
Ju tge Rucker in San Francisco, and no
time was lost in gatiing matters in snape
for tLe new field of oi erations. The
necessary -papers were soon drawn and
si^n*- i'and the transfer legally made.
A broad policy of iuture work has been
out. hied by tbe proprietors of this cure.
Atnon^ .other things- it is proposed to
thoroughly introduce the cure by the es
tablishment of institutes m New Zealand
and Australia, as well as in Africa. On
Mr. Cowan's return to Honolulu he will
a: on,ce mr.kc preparations for the Aus
tralian ioornejr. He will be accompanied
by Mr Klrkpatrick and Mr.Ab.es. When
the taoriv of organization in tne Antipodes
is concluded a party will head at once for
Africa, where undoubtedly fortune will
continue to smile upon them.
The syndicate that has purchased the
riiMit for the entire Dark Continent con
sists of Messrs. Cowart, Kirkpatrick, L. C.
Abies, J. Alfred McGoon ana Frank Mc-
S'tocker. Their choice of Africa was
brought about after a careful investiga
tion of conditions there obtained from
carefully prepared report-. Tiiese indi-.
cated that Africa was more in need of the
good work which they propose to do than
any other section probably on the globe.
In a.ll their transactions Mr. Cowart and
the gentlemen who have been interested
with -him made it a particular point
to-conduct their institute in a most basi
ne>s-iike way. They made no pretense of
poking as pbilsntnroj'ists nor as great
meral reformers. Their purposes were
well expressed in a few words by Mr.
Cowart. He Â«aid: "We go into a new
place. We don't pretend to preach or
teach morals, but go with a remedy that
wÂ« ktfow will cure for good the drinking
and morphine habits. "We go with a fair
and sauare business proposition. We
agree' to effect a cure or, failing, to de
.inand no pay% M
" Mr. Cowart and his associates made in

FOR AND AGAINST A NEW CONSTITUTION
California .Mayors Contribute Their Opinions on tfye Proposition to
Remodel the State Government. â 
In line with its desire to give the public all sides of every important question, THE CALL has opened its columns to a discussion of the proposed State Constitutional
Convention, provision for which \vas made by the Legislature. To day the opinions of two of California's Mayors are presented.
WILLIAM ROBINSON, the Mayor of Petaluma.
PETALUMA.
Mayor Robinson Is in Favor of a Change From the Present
Condition of Things, Especially as to the
System of Taxation*
PETALUMA, Cal., March 23.â Mayor William Robinson said:
"I consider the present State constitution remarkably defective, being most harm
ful in many points, besides lacking much that ordinary common-sense would indicate
as necessary. The most important change to my mind would be in taxation, which
now bears so heavily on the average citizen.
"The number of amendments being offered to this constitution shows in itself its
faultiness.
-'As to the single-tax, from my present views of the matter, I feel it would not be
just to all, but as a progressive man I am open to conviction.
"The old story of laboring classes existing without capital has been proved to be
most impossible, and the present constitution is responsible for a great deal of our
present hard times, as it has been the means of driving capital away from us.
"All classes of chitons have suffered sufficiently under the present state of affairs,
and it would seem that all should unite in calling for a convention to amend the
'sandlot constitution,' and the sooner the better. It is to be hoped a more intelligent
constitution will be made â it couldn't be worse."
CLAIMS A WHOLE
BLOCK OF LAND
Peter T. Seculovich De
mands a Big Slice of
Property.
An Old Pueblo Grant That May
Cause Present Eb'ders
Much Trouble.
Ellis, O'Farrell and Polk Streets and
Van Ness Avenue Bound the
Disputed Tract.
Peter T. SÂ«culovicb, an old and wealthy
resident of this City, has laid claim to a
block of land in the center of the resi
dence portion of San Francisco, and the
indications are that tbe present holders of
the property will have to battle in the
courts for their homes.
The land in question embraces the block
bounded by Ellis, O'Farrell and Polk
streets and Van Ness avenue, and is val
ued at several hundred thousand dollars.
Seculovich claims it under an old pueblo
jjrant, and says that he has ample evi
dence that he is entitlel to the property.
As a preliminary step, so as to make
any future proceedings in court perfectly
regular, he has applied to the Board of
Supervisors to place him in possession of
what he deems his own. Tbe matter was
up before the Otif-ide Lands Committee of
the board yesterday, wnen a formal com
munication from Mr. Seculovich was read,
asking tbe board to ueclare him tbe owner
of the land.
The communication slates that in 1861,
1862 or 1863 he riled a regular application
ior tbe land, on which he had settled sev
eral years before, when it was a barren
patch of land, under the provisions of the ,
old pueblo grant. Subsequently other
interests caused him to lone sight of his
property there, and he took no further
proceedings in tbe matter.
The committee decided that it conld not
put Mr. Seculovich in possession, but tbnt
if he. could make his claims good under
the present statutes he would be entitled
to the land.
Mr. Seculovich began a deeper investiga
tion into the matter yesterday by going
into the files of The Call of 1861, 1862 and
1863 to see whether from the reports of the
proceedings of the board he was not given
possession. He has already consulted an
attorney and may begin legal proceedings
at any time.
Those who hold property in the block
and would be affected should the courts
sustain Mr. Seculovich are:
P. F. Eutler, H. J. Sadler, Annie M. Overn
dick, Cecile J. Eagerly, Ferdinand Gee, W. T.
Helling, H. M. Heineman, Amelia Frank,
William Goldstein, E. L. Goldstein. A. Stein
berger, Charleg Bogan, Annie T. Martinez,
Thomas Rendall, J. W. Bridgman, A. C. Stod

ance will be large. Among the talent on the

Kaighan and Dr. Graham.
TURNER'S ODD POINT.
Ha Canted Delay in HlÂ« Trial and
Now Demands a Dig- -
/ m **â  - .
John F. Turner, charged with ; grand
larceny, was called to the bar for trial in
Judge Wallace's court yesterday morning.
Attorney George l). Collins, attorney for
the defendant, applied for a dismissal of
the case on the ground that the trial bad
been postponed more than sixty days after
the filing of tbe information. This mo
tion was based on the second subdivision
of section 1382 of tbe Criminal Code. .
Deputy District Attorney Black re
sponded that the delays had been granted
at tne request of the defendant, and At
torney H. C. Dibble, special counsel for
the prosecution, added his argument in
sustaining the position assumed by Mr.
Black.
In response Mr. Collins cited the recent
decision of the California Supreme Court
in the case of Jerome A. Buckley, w4ien,
he said, it was held that the provision of
the statute in that regard is unconstitu
tional, and that if the trial be postponed
over sixty days, even at the request of the
defendant, yet he is entitled to a dismissal
on account of the delay.
Judge Wallace said* he did not believe
the Supreme Court intended to say any
thing of tbe kind. He thought the Buck
ley case had been reversed on the ground
that the evidence was insufficient. The
mot on to dismiss was therefore denied.
Am appeal from Judge Wallace's ruling
will be taken to the Supreme Court.
Turner is accused of tampering with â¢
deed worth $8000, in which Counselor
Alfred Clarke held an interest.
THE PLEASURE-SEEKEBS.
An Association far Mutual Benefit of

Tuesday evening a number of ladles and
gentlemen at a meeting in this City or
ganized an association which is calculated
I will be a material benefit to people who
i enjoy country jaunts. The object of , the
| association is to arrange trips to the in
| terior for its ; mem to secure special
rates for charter-car r parties, to provide

summer resorts for them, and to dissem
inate information concerning points of in
terest in California 10 sightseers. Cards
of : membership will ,be issued â  after the
same manner as those of the League of
American Wheelmen.
The * management of the association
bas been intrusted to J. E. Lock, who is
well I informed concerning : places of .' in
terest 'â  on : the i Pacific j Coast. The social
features of the society will be on* of its

to provide entertainments at resorts dur

No Longer Friends.
Mary McGee and Ida Kramer were waitresses
at the Stewart Hotel, Ellis and Leavenworth
streets. Mary a few days ago induced Ida to
give her $15 to put in her trunk for safekeep

Tuesday Mary said some one had stolen the
money from her trunk. Ida complained to
the police and Mary was arrested yesterday on
tbe charge of misdemeanor embezzlement.

SAN RAFAEL.
William J. Miller, President of the Board of Trustees,
Contributes an Emphatic "No/* and
Tells Why.
William J. Miller, president of the Board of Trustees of the city of Ban Rafael,
writes:
SAN RAFAEL, Cat.., March 23.â A constitutional convention? No, sir. lean
not look upon tbe proposition with favor. Our present constitution is good enough.
Several amendments have been made 10 it. Last fall one was proposed which the
people wisely voted down â that to abolish tbe mortgage tax. Wt.en the constitution
wan submitted that provision was fiercely opposed by the money power, but it was
adopted, it has Justine l itself, and now, after nearly two decades of trial, tbe people
by a large majority refuse to abolish it. Amending the constitution is a much sim
pler process than building a new one.
Let us get down to practical affairs, and avoid agitation. Anew constitutional
convention is a device of lawyers, whose interests it would serve, and not those of the
people. Let us avoid disturbance, and give the new administration, so flush of prom
ises, a chance to redeem. Remember the farmers and consult their interests, for
when they prosper everybody feels it. We do not need any new constitution nor any
constitutional convention.
Mayor Ptaelan some time ago, but as the mat
ters objected to have been remedied the bill
will probably now go through all right.
SPOE.E TO THE SOCIALISTS.
l'.eT Haskett Smith AddreiÂ«e| a Large
Gat hnring of Liberty Branch.
Tbe auditorium of tbe Turk-street Tem
ple was filled last evening. It was the
regular meeting of Liberty Branch of the
Socialist Labor party ana Rev. Haskett
Smith of London was the speaker of tbe
evening. Previous to the address Theo
dore Lynch, the secretary of the branch,
read a selection entitled, "What Shall the
End Be?"
The visitor spoke for over an hour, his
suuiect being "Tbe True Motive Power of
Life."
In the course of his address be said
that so far as material possessions are
concerned, the millennium has already
come â to the wealthy. As all wealth is
created by labor, it is evident that if the
true motive power of human happiness
and aspiration were given their proper de
velopment and application there would
be less of the spirit of strife and sorrow
and conflict that prevails to-day in soci-
ety.
Short addresses were delivered by Dr. J.
D. Brock, P. R. Martin, William Edlin,
Evan Williams and others.
Next Wednesday evening Rev. S. Good
enough will speak on the "Message of So
cialism to Humanity."
MARTEN MAKES HIS PLEA
He Tries Hard to Convince the
Supreme Court of His
Sanity.
Hit Actions, However, Da Not Seem
to Be Those of a Han in
His Right Hind.
Dr. Arthur Marten, who pained such
unenviable notoriety in the Alma Josse
lyn case, appeared as bis own counsel in
the Supreme Court yesterday, and made a
fight against strong odds for his release
from the Mendocino Asylum for the In
sane, flis arrest and commitment there
were the result of the charges made by his
wife, who alleged that hs ased to treat her
and the children in a fiendish manner,
often locking them in a room and leaving
them there for days at a time because he
thought some one was going to take them
away.
Dr. Marten first took tbe floor and read
his petition, in which he charges the
whole State of Calilornia as being en
gaged in a conspiracy to deprive him of
liberty.
Judge Belcher, tbe committing magis
trate, was first examined. Marten per
sisted in interrupting him until Ciief
Justice Beatty told him that he mast act
like a sane man if he wished to convince
the court of his sanity.
Dr. Charles Wood worth, a member of
the insanity Commission, next testified.
He signed the commitment because he
believed Marten to be non compos mentis.
An objection of Attorney Dunn, repre
senting District Attorney Barnes, roused
Marten to such a pitch that he turned to
him and almost shouted, "Do you want to
railroad me to the asylum?" He would
also walk back and forth, glaring at Gen
eral W. H. L. Barnes, whom be believes
to be the high priest of his persecution.
After consideration the court granted a
continuance until to-morrow morning, so
that Marten might secure counsel ami
proceed with his case in accordance with
legal rales.

MRS. SCHEPPLER
FOUND AT LAST
Detectives Said to Have
Located Her in This
City.
She Assets That She Is Un
willing to Return to
Her Husband.
H. Stoll Alleged to BÂ« Responsible.
Her Farewell Note Was
Known to Be Genuine.
The mystery that so far has clouded the
disappearance of Mrs.' BesÂ»ie Scbeppler,
the bride of three days' standing, now
seems in a pretty fair way to be cleared
up. So far as can b9 learned, the parents
and friends being very secretive on the
subject, the young woman is at this mo
ment in San Francisco well and strongly
averse to returning to grace her husband's
fireside as a good wife naturally would
care to.
"We learned late this afternoon," said
Mrs. Young, the mother, last evening,
"that Bessie is right here in this City.
She was seen by two detectives whose
services were engaged by Mr. Scbeppler â
I do not care to say where at presentâ and
â¢ hey baa a long talk with her. She would
not say why she left home, but did assert
emphatically that she would not return.
"That she left her husoand willingly
cannot be denied, because tbe farewell let
ter she left was in her handwriting. Her
sister and myself can assert that posi
tively; her husband is mistaken.
"I am at a loss to explain her action, as
she was always a good girl and of a qmet
disposition. She was not forced into the
marriage, as she said in her letter, at all.
She dia it of her own free will.
"But a month ago I found her crying.
She said it was because her intended hus
band, who bad only one evening in the
week off, preferred going to singing
school to taking her out to some place of
amusement."
Mrs. Young also asserted that Henry
Stoll, the young Oakland butcher em
ployed until lately by a Mr. Baker, had
not called to see her daughter for over two
years. His disappearance two weeks ago,
she was inclined to believe, had nothing
to do with her daughter leaving her hus
band.
Stoll had negotiated for the purchase of
Byron W. Warren's butcher-shop at 2328
Fillmore street, and arrangements were
completed February 20. Since that time
he is said to have been missing, and Mr.
Scheppler is strongly inclined to think
that whether his wife went away willingly
or not, atoll had a hand in affairs.

The trouble came to a head in the Jus
tice Court yesterday when the case of W.
S. Harper against tbe Olympic Publishing
Company was Drought to trial.
It appeared that the versatile deputy
Justice Court clerk had felt the yearning
of the budding author, and at tr.e request
of tbe publishers of the Olympic, an
athletic periodical, had written a story
called "A Lost Bike."
The story was to be in three chapters at
"five per," and the embryo Jules Verne
thrilled with joy when the journal did
not suspend publication after the first
issue of his story.
To write was easy â dead easyâ but to draw
his pay was different, and though he man
aged to get a couple of dollars on account
in the shape of a loan the remainder of
the agreed price, $13, was not forthcom
ing. So, nothing daunted by the ill omen
of tbe number of dollars due, George sued
through Harper, and Justice Groezinger
listened without cracking a smile when
on being asked if the story was reason
ably worth $15 the author gravely replied
that it was.
The matter was continued until his at
torney conld ascertain whether he was
suing a soulless corporation or an indi
vidual.
NOTES OF THE THEATERS
Novel Features of the Melo
drama at the Grand
Opera* House.
"The Great Northwest" at the Grand
this week is quite a departure from the
beaten track of melodrama. The scene is
laid in a boom town on the plains, which
gives occasion for the introduction of a
number of breezy, bucolic characters,
who say and do things that have a re
freshing spice of wild and woolly uncon
ventionality.
Two of the moat novel personalities in
the play are a pair of fire volunteers.
Gopher Bunch and Ginger Crockett,
playd respectively by Nat N. Wills and
Leslie Morosco. They are rivals in love
and at conflagrations, and the novel way
in which they propose to the same lady
imparts a breeziness to the performance
which is not found every day in melo
drama.
Miss Irma Fitch makes a fascinating
soubrette and literally owns the bouse
while she is on the stage. Julia Blanc
shines as a female villain and Anna Daley
makes quite a hit as the heroine who
wears bloomers and rides a bike.
The Alcazar is Hairing a successful week
with "The Strategists." Hugo Toland's
lightning changes excite wonder and ad
miration on the part of the auience.
They also call for the exercise of a good
deal of faith to imagine that tie rotund
Toland could possibly be mistaken for
men of half his dimensions. However, the
acting is breezy and quick and Toland's
masquerading goes well.
Fanny Davenport's engagement is near
ing its end at the Baldwin. On Saturday
night Miss Davenport will say au revoir
in her famous play, "La Tosca." On that
evening she will distribute silver souvenirs
to the ladies on the lower floor in com
memoration of her last appearance here
in tbe Sardou plays.
"His Grace de Ghrammont" is the play
With which Otis Stcinnet will open his
engagement at the Baldwin Theater on
Monday evening next.
Cissy Fitzgerald will continue her hoop
skirt dance at the Columbia till Sunday
evening, when "The Foundling" ends its
engagement On Monday Mr. and Mrs.
Russ Whytal will open in "For Fair Vir
ginia," which comes here with a record
of over 400 performances. It is a romantic
drama of life in the O.d Dominion during
war times and tells two pretty love stories
projected against an exciting background
of war incidents.
Nicolai's opera, "The Merry Wives of
Windsor," has scored a strong success at
the Tivoli Opera-house, but it will only be
sung this week. Next Monday evening
the spectacular burlesque "Don Juan
lib.)" will be presented with new scenery,
costumes, specialties, songs, dances and
eccentricities.
Most of t lie new stars are shining
brightly at the Orpheum. More novel
ties are promised for next week.
rierr Ferdinand Stark and bis Vienna
orchestra are rendering attractive pro
grammes at the Oberon mis week.
One of the features of the French opera
season at tne California Theater will be
the presentation this evening of the great
double bill of "Les Dragons de Villars"
and "La Navarraise." Both operas will
be well cast and in the latter Mme. Foedor
will sing Anita. On Saturday afternoon
Ambroise Thomas' "Mignon" is .to bo
sung.
Mrs. Gertrude Auld Thomas, who
scored such a success at the last sym.
phony concert, announces two recitals at
Golden Gate Hall on Wednesday evening,
April 7, and a Saturday matinee on April
10. She wilt' be assisted by 8. Savanab,
violinist, and Robert E. Newell, pianist.
Gustav Hinrichs, director of the sym
phony orechestra, will delivers gratituous
lecture on tbe Wagner programme on the
next symphony concert at Golden Gate
Hall (upper) next Wednesday afternoon
at 3:30. The music-loving public is in
vited to attend.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
If you have not yet subscribed to the
boulevard fund, now is the time to do so.
The tariff debate this time is clearly a
twice-told tale, vexing the duil ears of
drowning men.
All the great railroad associations have
gone to pieces in ptrbiic, but perhaps they
may come together again behind some
convenient screen.
The Cretan crisis, which once threat
ened to bcii over, has now settled down
to a simmer and may possibly stay in the
same condition all summer.
The floods have begun to fail in the Etst,
but earthquakes have begun to rumble all
the way from New York to Montreal, and
the people are cot happy yet.
Tariff-making must be popular at "Wash
ington, for it is now said the Senate pro
pciej to engage in the work and will try
to improve on the Dingley bili.
The Cubans have taken an-.tber town
from the Spaniards, and before long we
may be able to announce that they have
stormed Havana and taken the whole
island.
Sausalito has discovered that she needs
S better equipped fire department, and if
ehe had found it out before she would not
now be short of a yacht club house and
haif a dczen other buildings.
It was, perhaps, well enough in Tennes
see to enact another law against white
caps, but ail the same the people of the
country at laree would like to see a little
more resolute enforcement of the former
laws.
â¢ It is said the Democrats of the Senate
wiil pay no attention to whai is done by
the Democrats of the House in fighting
the tan 3 bill. They will go their own way
and will try to hold up in the Senate the
new tariff as they held up the Wiison bilL
President Kruger 5s as eager as Cecil
Rhodes to estabiish a united South Africa,
but he wishes it to be a free repebiic in
stead of a part of the British em Dire, and
as the whole Dutch element of South Af
rica :â¢ wi;h him he mar yet see his desire
accomplished.
In his address at the celebration of
foundation day at tbe State University,
Mr. Davij very aptly defined the new
esech which now opens for the institution
as 'the building era." It promises to be
that beyor.d ail question, and before the
close of the decade we shall probably see
at Berkeley some of the finest university
buildings in America.
The banquet given to ex-Senator Dubois
by the silver Republicans at Washington
could hardly hare been a joyous feaÂ«t, as
ail the bolting Republicans who were
present must have been conscious tbaft
the fate which has overtaken Durxvls will
soon overtake them. "Funeral baked
meats'' wouid have sufficiently furnished
forth a feast of that kind.
The report that Canada will alter her
tariff by way of retaliation for the Dingley
bill wilt not occasion much alarm. The
Canadian market is Kot very large, and if
her Government chooses to keep onr prod
ucts out of it we will not complain, so
long a^ we can prevent her lumber, wool
and grain from competing with horn*
products in our own market.
Rhode Island mi.!-owners report that
orders are coming in for all the fine wool
and worsteds made tcere, and as a result
mills that have long bÂ»en shut down are
now starting their machinery and getting
ready for business. This is an illustration
of the Industrial tendency of the whole
country. Tne effect! of the coming tariff
are already felt and business is improv
ing.
' The Senate debate -on the civil service
law brought out some amusing feat ares of
the- way in which it has been adminis
tered. linger referred to the law as a
"monumental hambug," and Hawley de
clared the commission bad reached a state
of "conipicnons incoxnpetency." It is
evident that in the work of civil service
reform Mr. Cleveland was as big a bungler
as in anything eIM he undertook.
Although the outbreak in Crete has to
some extent distracted attention from
Armenia, the disturbances in that coun
try continus almost as violent as ever,
and the powers will yet have to coerce
Turkey as well as Oreece in order to re
store peace in the -Levant. In fact, they
would render a service to humanity by
withdrawing their forces from Crete and
landing them in Armenia at once.
One of the notable features of the tariff
debate on Tuesday was the speech of Mr.
McLaurin, a Democrat from South Caro
lina, who, instead of attacking the bill be
cause of its protective character, made an
earnest plea for heavier duties on Egypt
ian cotton for the benefit of Southern
cotton-growers. It was noted, moreover,
that other Democrats from the cotton
States applauded him. Free trade hss
been slaughtered in the home o." its friends.
Newiands of Nevada, although be acted
with ihe Democrats on the silver question
during the last campaign, now stands
with the Republicans on % the tariff ' issue
and has warned the Democrats in Congress
that "this is no time" to '. play small " poli
tics." If the Democratic leaders hope to
retain any large portion of 1 the silver Re
publican vote in the next campaign," they
must -heed the warning. Small politics
never wins with any class of Eepubiicwis,
CUBAH VICTORIES.
The announcement of the capture of
Holgain, one of the most important cities
of the proy:nce of Santiago de Cuba, by
the patriot forces under command of Gen
eral Garcia, and the successful attacks on
Cano, near Havana, are new evidences
added to the many given late.y of the ap
proaching collapse of the Spanish power
in Cuba. 6o far from being ab.e to over
run the insurgent districts, the Spanish
forces are unabie to hold their own or
even to defend themselves in the cities.
General Weyter has been in command
in Cuba for about a year, ana has had
ample time, as well as opportunity, to put
his po icy into force and give it a fair trial.
From the first it has been a policy of great
severity against ail c. asses of Cubans. As
a result those citizens of thÂ« island who
held moderate views, and who, while not
in favor of Spanish rule, had not taken
arms against it, were forced either to go
into exile, join the insurgents or run the
risks of imprisonment and death. They
have in nearly every case chosen to ally
themselves with the patriots, and the
main effect of the policy of severity,
therefore, has been to strengthen the cause
of freedom.
In his military policy \Veyier has been
as unfortunate as in that of government.
As he has made no friends for Spain
among the mo lerate Cubans, neither has
he won for it any victories or success over
the patriots. He has made marches at the
head of a strong army through the four
provinces of P;nar del Rio, Havana,
Matanzas and Santa Clara, but as the
patriots avoided an open battle all that
he accomplished by these raids was the 'â¢
burning of homes and the wasting of
plantations. He has made a desert and
has called it peace, but unfortunately for
him it has not been peace. The moment '
his army was withdrawn th* patriots re
turned to the devastated provinces and
unfurled once more the flag of Cuban
freedom.
The retirement of the Spanish army
from the field has been followed by a
Cuban advance upon their strongholds in
the cities. In several of these movements
they hare attacked and captured fortifica-
I tions in the suburbs of Havana itself.
! Tasy have everywhere showa themselves
; alert, â u.lliwlwi and courageous. The
1 capture of Holguin comes as a conclusive
1 proof that the noid of Spain is weakening
even on tho strongholds of tne island.
j This has been tLe result of a year of Wey
ler's policy. Another six months of i:
sad Cuba will be free.
THE UNIVERSITY.
The celebration of charter day at the
State University this year has been a mat
ter of more than usual interest by reason
of the new twiHiilhlHH under which its
growth will tate place in the future. The
increised revenues granted by the S:ate
in connection with those which are ex
pected from private generosity and muni
ficence assure a new impetus to t~.e de
velopment at Berkeley and make the
charter day of this year the starun^ point
of a new university era.
Ths Hon. W. E. Davis, who spoke for
the Alumni at the celebration, said the
history of the university might be di
vided into six stages, and very aptly char
acterized that which now confronts the
university as "the building era." It is
certain t:.e title will be justified by events
in the new future. lac act recently
passed by the Legislature confirms a
policy of liberal support to the institu
tion. It provides it with the means for
undertaking the construction of the addi
tional buildings which have long been
needed, and therefore the building era is
a certainty.
The increased revenues from the State
are, however, by no means all that will be
forthcoming when the work of bniiding
up the university fairly begins. Gifts of
sums of money have been assured from
many sources, and some of these will be
in amounts large enough to construct
spacious monumental ba:ldings of them
se.Tej. In the aggregate they will reaca
a sum so large as to give new hopes and
ambitions to the institution, as will as
new habitations to the colleges, classes and
museums.
The people of the State will hall with
gratification tne first evidence of the new
wort that is to bezin the building era.
They are proud of the university, which,
although so young, holds so hi -h a rans
among the educational forces of the
Union. Tney rejoice, moreover, that the
service of the university is given pri
marily to the advancement of public wel
fare. As Mr. Davis said, "It is the S'.ate
tbat is the end, not the schools; it is man
that is the end, not science or philosophy ;
it is the uplifting of the race that is the
end, not human knowledge."
THE BRITISH ffAVY.
lie explanatory statement of the First
Lori of the British Admiralty, submitting
under date of February 22 the naval esti
mates for 2537-98, is a remarkably brief
document, coutiaing it=eif to bare facts
expressed in the most condensed form,
and it required only about fifteen min
utes for the members of the two bouses
of Parliament to get a pretty fair idea of
what has been done, and what new meas
ures are proposed.
The net total estimate for the fiscal
year beginning April L ISO 7, amounts to
$109,190,000. against $109,115,000 for the
present year jast closing. The snipbuild
ine vote snows a decrease of $2,555,000, but
every other branch is increased, notably
the personnel, with an increase of $1,7-0,
--; 000, and the ordnance of $653,000.
The number of officers, seamen, boys,
coastguard and marines allowed for
189697 was 93,750; the estimates for the
coming year increase it to 100,050, the
increase comprising 121 officers, 2400 sea
men, 265 engine-room artificers, 2000 stok
ers, 1000 marines and 514 artisans, and
others.
A erade of warrant officer engineer has
been estabiuhed as an encouragement to
engine-room mechanics who have ren
dered meritorious servic?.
A reorganization of the naval reserve is
shortly to be carried into effect, and also
an increase of the number of officers and
men, which unaer tae new order wiil then
be composed of 1400 sailor officers, 300 en
gineer officers, 2300 seamen, 3000 firemen
and 300 boys.
It is proposed to build during the com
ing year: Four battle-ships, three third
class cruisers, two sloops, four twin-screw
eunboat s and two torpedo-boat destroyers.
Including the new programme there will
then be under construction or completion
during 1397-98 an aggregate number of 103
vessels of 380,000 tons and 800,000 horse
power, comprising the following classes of
vessels: Fourteen battle-ships, eight first
class cruisers, nine second-class cruisers,
ten third-class cruisers, two sloops, four
twin-screw gunboats, fifty-two torpedo
boat destroyers, eight light- draught
steamers, one roysl yacht.
As to the manufacture of guns, in the 12
--inch and other wire- wound gans improve
ments are steadily made, and the conver
sion of 6-inch ana 4-inch breechloaders to
quick firers is rapidly carried on. Cordite is

A new dockyard is contemplated at
Gibraltar and the work has progressed
in reclamation and embankment. The
lengths of the three docks in tee new yard
have been fired at 850, 550 and 450 feet.
It should be noted that tte sum of
Â£_i.?S>.GO9, or nearly $109,190,000, doe* not
cover the entire expense of the navy afloat

are going on for which separate appro
priations are made.
EFFECT OF MACHINERY.
In a paper recently submitted to the
American Academy of Political and So
cial Science by E. Levasseur of Paris,
upon "The Concentration of Industry and
Machinery in the United States," the
author gives the resnlts of the study of
the industrial conditions ol this country
as seen through foreign eyes, and also
gives a summing up of the advantages
and disadvantages of machinery, consid
ered a; a genera! economic question, to
the three classesâ manufacturers, laborers
and consumers.
The first point he notices in our indus
tries iÂ» their tendency to concentration,
which is the natural consequence of the
increase in the power of machines, the
improvement in transportation and the
great srowta of capital. He says that a
careful examination of the condition of
aJTairs in America convinces one that
"the future is there." and he is also con
vinced that the concentration of large
capital and large plants is not of much
ian/er. The aggrandizement of taanu
facrarers, he thinks, has Us natural limits
and there will always be room for the
small trader and manufacturer. For the
' rough manufacturer of products of very
1 large consumption that require cbeap
: ness rather than artistic and individual
istic qualities, the gÂ»-eat machinery plants
wi.l always have their use and America
wiil be apt to lead in their supply, but in
i the work of finer fiaisfl, when requires
I spontaneity or delicacy of the human
mind, the French hold the advantage.
The revolution in industrial conditions
| caused by the development of machinery
| he attributes mainly to the enterprising
! spirit and inventive genius of the Ameri
| can people. He'mentions the statistics of
patents for one year, in which America
had 26,000. as compared with 7000 in
France. We hays in the last sixij years
had more than half a million patents
granted.
While admitting that the transition
from the crude methods of manufacture
which employ many workmen to the ever
swifter and more perfect machinery causes
often temporarily a great deal of misery
among the laboring classes by throwing
them out of employment, he maintains
that statistics carefully studied prove con
clusively that improvement in machinery
is on the whole advantageous to the labor
ing classes, as well as to the manufacturer
and the consumer. They multiply the
consumption of products and therefore
the chances of ecp.oymeni, and, more
over, as ail laborers are themselves con
sumer.-, they reap the benefit of cheap
prices.
THE KAYY POS BOY 3,
The desertion of twenty boys from the
United States training ship Adams while
in port in San Diego last Sunday morn
ing, and the comments thereon by one of
the officers ol the vessel, show that there
is an evil connected with the training of
i boys for the sea which should be remedied
by seme radical change in the system.
That the youths should object, and
blamelessly object, as the officer evidently
feels, is a senoas matter especially ai this
time when so much of the hope for the
future of onr country is based upon the
building up of a great merchant marine
and a navy competent to protect it. Thp
discouragements should be promptly re
moved, and such Dright inducements of
fered as will make many of the mos: spir
ited and ambitious of our boys look for
ward with nigh hopes to a career upon the
seas.
The ofScer states that the boys are well
treated in their apprenticeship to Uncle
Sam and get plenty of good food, and it is
noc discontent from such ills which causes
desertion. He states that the navy is not
the best place for boys. The main thing
he deplores in the system is that it de
stroys home and home influences. Many
of these iittie influences, be says, even
though some of them are seemingly fool
ish, yet have a never-to-be-forgotten
value. It is a poor discipline, he thinks,
which teaches nothing higher than im
pi:c:t obedience to orders.
The problem presented ii quite a grave
one ani it must be solved. We are com
pelled to have seamen from the best blood
in the land if we exnect to continue a
great nation, and we most Dot ruin the
can in making the saiior. Perhaps the
evil complained of might be largely reme
died by arranging lor long vacations and
rotation in service. The boys could then
frequently return to home influences, and
they would naturally be lionized by their
companions and so gain a fresh zest for
ocean life. ____________ __

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Lilli Lehmana, the famous Wagnerian ?
singer, is falling in for her share oi the abuse :
wh:ch a nnmlier of Xew York critics seem de- j
terained to bes:ow npoa foreign artists this I
season. She is supposed to be the cnief female j
star of DÂ»rarosch's German operatic season; j
and as Kordica is in the same tronpe, it will
go hard with the** critics if they do not finally
succeed in sttrrine up strifs between the two
prlma donnas. At present the critics who â¢.
abased Jean de Eeszfce are abusing LÂ«hmann. |
while superlative adjectives almost fail to ex- j
press their admiration for Kordica. No doubt j
a great deal of the praise is due to Xordica's j
singing, but still more springs from her fa- ;
mons quarrel with Jean de Resike and Meiba.
Nordica's reappearance in Kew York after her
Western tour was B!8de the other day as E;sa
in Damrosch's production of "Lohengrin."
She was dressed superbly and received the
lion's share of the appianse. Lehmaan sang :
Ortnid, and the priaa donnas amicably sh*red j
the curtain calls, though most of them seem
to have been meant fat Nordica. The peace
and harmony between the two prima donnas

is very beautiful, bat Wagnerian roles eeem
doomed to be a bone oi contention with Kor
dica;andas Lehmann is to sing some of the
fair Lillian's favorite parts. It will be contrary
to precedent if there is not a rift within the
lute soon.
With Mme. Foedor protesting vigorously
that sne is the falcon of the French opera
troupe at the California Theater, and Mile.
Aimee Pascal begging to be allowed a chance
of showing thai she, too, possesses the quali
fications for becoming a /aieon. it is interest
ing to recall the fact that less than a month
ago the woman who enriched the French lan
guage with the word falcon died, after living
mote and inglorious for over half a centniy.
Marie Cornelia Falcon created the role of
Rachael In "La Jnive" and Valentine in "Les
Bnguenou" In 1836-37. Her voice was a
dramatic soprano â limpid, wide of rangeâ the
most beautiful voice, said her contemporaries,
that had ever been heard. . In 1840 she was
taking a benefit at the Paris opera and was to
sing Rachaei. Falcon, after receiving sa.v.s
of applause, attacked her first recitative. In
stead of the pure, ringing voice, dull, muffled
notes were heard, and people in the audience
looked at one another overcome with surprise.
The artist remarking the stupefaction of her
hearers burst Into tears. , It is . said that none
of the spectators ever forgot that night. They
encouraged her with applause and she got
through her role â then disappeared. Ency
clopedias and musical biographies say that no
one ever knew what became of her, but the
name/oleon remained a synonym for the most
heroic quality of dramatic soprano.
Falcon was 25 years of age when she lost
her voice, and that was fi!:y-six years ago.
Every one believed her dead, wbeaamonth
ago the memories of another generation were
revived in Paris by tie news "La Falcon is
dead." The tragic way in which she lost her
voice is always alluded to as oae of the most
dramatic episodes o! theatrical life and Falcon
is still cited as the most ideal Valentine that
ever appeared on any stage. Speaking of her
death, Le Figaro fays:
"How many dramatic sopranos has the con
servatory not thrown on the stage since her
time, and of each of them we were told 'An
other Faicoa'? How many of them have not
died? and yet tte first Falcos, the dramatic
soprano, who gave her name to all the others,
was living as qi.etly and silently as if she had
been born dumb. To write her obituary we
hare to look up the files of dusty newspapers
over fifty years old, consult dictionaries, and,
above all, get oid people to talkâ antique ratV
scrioers to the opera who say 'La Falcon? ah,
yes; I think I can remember,' ani thus man
age to recall anecdotes of the famous star."
The tenor, Vandyck, of the Paris Grand
Opera and the Vienna Opera, has been en
gsged for Grau's season in London, which will
open at CoTent Garden Theater on May 10
with "Tannhauser" in French. It Is not im
probable that Vandyck will sing in New York
at the Metropolitan Opera-house next season,
for the strong cabal which was raised against
Jean de Re&zke has had an injurious effect on
the season just closed. The cabal sprang out
of the Nordica-Meiba squabble and tne h:~fc
saiary question. Jean de Reszke Is a rich man,
and says he aoes not care to Â«icg, but if he
obliges the mansgement by '.earing his Polish ,
stud farm and coming to America he means to
be paid prices that in Europe would be be
yond tae dreams of even his arar.ee. The en
gagement of VandycK in the place of Jean de
Reszke at tne Metropolitan wonld calm a great
deal of the opposition which the management
had to endure last winter.
A pitiful tale of Richard Wagner's strait
ened circumstances is unfolaed in a series of
letters which the Frankfurter Zeiiung has re
cently published for the first time. They are
dated 1862, when the master was at Blebrich,
near Mavec.e. engaged in the composition of
the ''Meistersinger." The recipient of the
harrowing story of struggle ani poverty was
the composer. Wendelin Weissheimer. In
April Wagner's affairs reached such a pitch
that he decided to withdraw to a more se
clnded place, the carriage which was to take
him away had already been ordered lor the
next morning, when an enroy appeared with
an invitation from King Louis II of Bavaria,
who generously offered him support and pro
tection.
Anna Held, "The Idol of Paris," has been
queening it in New York all winter on the
strength of her French refutation and the
risque songs she has sung whica nine-tenths
of he; audier.ee bare not understood. Mean
whiie the Anna Held known to Paris has
been singing.all winter at La Scala in the gay
French capital and has known not New York.
This is the way a confiding public which takes
foreign stars on trust is sometimes beguiled
by wily managers. The Anna Held of Peris
recently made up her mind to try fresh fields
and pastures new on her own account, went off
to Sweden and broke her engagement with the
Seal*. She has just been condemned by the
French courts to pay 25.000 francs damages
to M. Marchand. the director of the Scala.

MUST BE PAVED
Mayor Phelan Will Insist
Upon Railroad Work
Being Done.
Manager Vining Outlines the
Company's Policy on
Unused Tracks.
Will Not Abandon Control of the
Rails B;c use They May BÂ«
Used in the Future.
Mayor Phelan intends to extend the
field of bis inquiries as to the manner in
woich the street railroad* of San Fran
cisco live nD to their franchises and the
attention they pay to the orders of the
Board of Supervisors.
While waiting for the conference wkh
the various roads regarding the removal
of the anased tracks aocn: ti.e City, ha
will make an attempt to ascertain why the
Market-street Company does not compij
with the resolutions of the Board of Super
visors regarding Eighth street, from Mar
ket to Foisom.
The car tracks there were laid down
while the street was pared with cobb) tftaf
Later, when the City, acting in conjaj
tion with property-owners, paved tj,^
roadway wit i bitumen, the Superintend
ent of S'reets notified the company that
â¢he space between the tracks and those
between the raLs must be paved with iika
material.
No attention was paid to the notice and
the Board of Supervisors passed a resolu
tion ordering the work doae. Still the
company was obdurate and a second reso
lution threatening suit against the com
pany was passed, bat with no greater suc
cess.
The Mayor intends to look into fhe
legal phases of the Eightn-street matter
and, if possible, bring about some action
that will result in the siree: being pavevl
as the street law contemplates.
The mailer of the unused rails on Bash
â¢treet, now before the Supreme Conrt,
will also be closely looked into.
General Manager Vining of the Market
street Railway Company does not beheve
with Mayor Phelan that all railway tracks
; that are not being usedshou'd be removed
! from tne streets of San Francisco. Refer
' rine to the proposed action of the Super
visors he said yesterday that it would be
simply entailing a deal of unnecessary
labor and expense on the company to
make it take up such rails.
"Matters are in this shape at present,"
ihe explained. "There are "a few tracks for
; which there is no demand just now, be
! cause of better and more convenient lines.
i Take the Stockton-street line. People do
not care to nse that because there is an
I electric tine on Kearny street and a cable
i line on Powell street, each offering better
! accommodations than the former horse
line did on Stockton street. For this rea
son we had to stop it for the time being.
The same is true is reference to the Battery
I and First street line. There are better
i lines at the service of the public on Sco
; ond. Third and Fourth streets. Therefore
; they failed to patronize tne horse line we
â  : operated on First strati tad Battery
I street, and as it did not pay we were
forced to discontinue it.
"Bat here's the point. San Francisco is
growing and U bound to be a large city.
There will be a million people here some
day, and before that day comes some of
these tracks will be needed for transporta
tion purposes. We would be glad to do
anytning we could legally to help the
situation; bat, under the circumstances,
I don't think we should be required to
take op any of these tracks. Tnere is not
business enough to warrant us running
cars oc these lines at presen:. Bat let
business pick up in a year or two and ail
of them will probably 'be required.
"Our people don't want to tear up the
tracks and abandon the lines when per
haps in a year or two there wiil be a de
mand for them. We want to do what is
fair and right. It would be useless ex
pense for us to tear up the tracks now,
when we would hare to put them ctovi
Again in a short time, in all probability.
These lines are now a source of some
thousands of dollars of expense to us
every year. We have to keeo them in
repair and also our portion of the street.
We employ men specially to look after
thia."

now in the Afonalaw.
The Merioneth wi 1 now have to lower
her colors to the Miltiades, which has just
completed the run from San Francisco to
London in eighty-four days. When it
came to a question of racing the American
and English clippers made splendid time,
but all their best efforts have been put in
the shade by the Miltiades. On every oc
casion she has made good time, ana when
leaving this port Captain Harry Ayling
made a number of bets to the effect that
he wonld land his vessel in an English
port inside of 100 days. He has not only
won his bets but has also broken the
rt coru.
The Androssa left here a month ahead
of the Miiliades, but she has met with
disaster instead of success. The news of
the iwo vessels was posted at the Mer
chants' Exchange yesterday. The arrival
of ihe latter and the abandonment of the
former were both chronicled at the
same time. On the 7th inst., when 300
miles wesi of Falmou'.h, and while thf
Miltiade3 was making port with every
sail set, the Androssa hove to and the
crew was being piled into all the avail
able boats. All the otlicers and sailors
were saved, but the chances are that the
cargo, valued at $320,000, will be a total
loss.
In connection with the trip oi the Mil
tiades the following notes furnished by
the exchange are interesting:
British ship Melanope, previously reported
at Queenstown, irom Oregon, lost mate over
boa/d, smuM:''rt wheel, stcrnpost, lifeboats
ana lost sails during voyage.
British snip Aibyn, hence November 13, at
Queenitown, hnd terrific weather off Cape
Horn, smashed wheel and lost sails.
The following notice >o rusriners has
been issued by the Lighthouse inspectors
in regard to the Sau Francisco bar:
It is reported that the inside bar buoy, first
class nun. 'black and white perpendicular
stripes, has disappeared. If so it will be re
placed to-morrow.

"Charley" Hevernan, the popular
freight clerk of the Steamer Tiburon, was
around again yesterday. He has been a
very sick men, and far several weeks was
laid up in the German hospital. He is
now able to be out and about again, and
yesterday was receiving tne congratu
lations of the passengers who patronize
the Tiburon and San Rafael ferry, on his
reappearance on the gate and aboard the
steamer.
The ferry steamers Encinal and Newark
and the gasoline launch owned by the
San Francisco Laundry, were in close
proximity yesterday. The Newark sig
naled the launch to ko to port, but she
failed to do so, and in getting out oj the
little craft's way the Encinal was en
countered. In consequence both ferry
boats came to a stop, in order to avoid a
collision, while the gasoline launch
steamed on as though nothing had
happened.
The Alaska Packing Association's newly
purchased ship, tlie Santa Clara, will de
part next week for Alaska with a big load
of Chinese salmon -canners and a hold fall

sel is now at Fremont-street wharf and
carpenters are fitting her up forward be

vessel for the association. It is a email
fifty-ton steamer, wnicn will act as a ten
der to the fleet and also ply between the
association's canneries.
The North American Mercantile and
Trading Company has received a setback.
Tlie company's Alaskan coal has beea
tried on the revenue cutters now in port,
and the report is that it does not come up
to the standard. In consequence, the
Hartley. Rush, Patterson and other Gov
ernment vessels are now using Comox
coal.
The stern-wheel schooner Grace Barton
is the prettiest vessel of her class in the
bay. When s:ie was rebuilt the wise
acres said that she would roll in a sea
way, and in consequence be a very un
comfortable boat to travel on. Her first
trip proved their mistake. She in, with
out doubt, the most comfortable boat on
the river trade, and instead of being a
roller she is as steady as a rock. The
work of repairing the Sunoi is going on
rapidly, and the chances are that she will
he ready for her old run long before the
Barton is wanted on tho Alvi9o route. In
spite of the heavy setback Arthur Piper,
Joe Aden, Harry Goodall and Al Pryor
still come up trailing and say, "Boys,
all's well that ends well. There were no
lives lost."
The wrecker Whitelaw is still patrolling
the place where the Sunol went down.
She is seeking for the boiiers that went
out when the vessel turned turtle, and
incidentally for whatever her dragnets
will bring tin in the shape of lead bars.
There are 1500 of tbe latter, in the mud,
and every one of them recovered means at
least $25 saved. The bars are really silver
ore, and were on tbeir way to the Selby
Smelting Works for reduction.
T Â« trip to Alaska got up by Alfred
McNevin it not a colonization scheme,
neither is it a wild goose chase. The ves
sel will be paid for before the men leave
the dock, and there will be at least six
months' provisions aboard. Any member
of the expedition who wants to settle up
there can do so, but all and sundry will
have an interest in the trio. A consider
able quantity of trade will be taken up,
and tbe results will be divided pro rata on
the return to San Francisco. The vessel
is to be sold to the highest bidder, so that
when accounts are squared no one can be
a very heavy loser, even though he puts
in the money he puts up as a bad debt.
LOST PART OF HIS LEG.
Policeman P. Whelan Had an
Encounter With -
Bulldog.
He Wants to Have the B.ast Killed
and Its Owner Incar
cerated
Police Officer Whelan, or what is left of
him, is aggressive.
He, and a bulldog belonging to John
Doe Matthews, became mixed up some
few evenings ago, and the dog got the
best of it. In consequence Whelan wants
the dog killed, and he prays lor the ar
rest of John Doe Matthews as the keeper
of vicious dogs.
Judge Joachimsen has issued a warrant
for the owner* arrest, but nothing has
been done vet to produce the dog or tho
missing pieces of Whelan's anatomy.
The policeman was attending to his
duty last Saturday nicht on Stevenson
street, between Sixth and Seventh, vben
be observed a suspicious character skulk
ing along in the shadow of the houses.
He cried "Halt," but the man ran and
Whelan set out after him.
As they passed the house of Mr. M at
thews the bulldog took some interest in the
chase. He seized the hindmost m&n and
the hindmost part of him, considerably
interfering with his chances of catcniug
the fugitive.
The latter escaped, but Whelan's trou
sers did not, and he asks now that the
owner of the dog be punished for owning
such a beast, and the beast be killed lor
biting deeper than the thickness of a po
liceman's trousers.

TO BE SAVED

It Will Tell the Truth
About Adulterated
Groceries.
How Mr. Stutz Will Keep Within
the Provisions of the Pure
Food Law.
Objections Made by tbe Retail Grocers'
Association to the Manner of
Its Enforcement.
The pure food law was the subject of an
animated discussion at the meeting of the
Retail Grocers' Association last night.
It was admitted that the law bad a good
end in view, but the complaint was made
that all the bnrden was placed on the
shoulders of the retailers, while the whole
sale dealers and the manufacturers were
allowed tn go unmolested. Another
grievance was that the grocers werÂ«Â» not
allowed any time in which to get rid of
the adulterated stock, but were snatched
up in the grip of the law unawares.
It was slated at the meeting that 63 per
cent of the manufactured lood products
in the United Stales were adulterated,
and that to remedy the evil and to do bo
injustice to any one it was necessary to
apply the law first to the manufacturers
and then all the way down from the
wholesaler to the retailer. But the de
fect in the operation of the law was that
manufacturers outside of this State could
not be reached, while matters of adulter
ated goods in this State had not been
punished.
It was mentioned in the meeting last
night that Grocer Ciine had been heavily
fined for selling raspberry jelly that had
been adulterated, and that the manu
facturers, whose factory was in this City,
had not been complainel against or ar
rested.
J. C. Nobmann reported that he had
called on Secretary Gcdchaux of the
Board of Health and gave that official his
objections against the manner in which
the law was being enforced. To his sur
prise, Mr. Godchaux opened a report on
the operation oi the pure-food law of
Onio and pointed out in that report every
objection that ho had made, together with
the reply thereto. Whenever Mr. Nob
mann mentioned a fresh objection Secre
tary Godchanx said: "Yes; here it is, on
l>ajie so and so of the Ohio report. You
see, all those objections are old and have
been answered time and again."
Grocer Stutz sail that Patrolman Broth
erton, who had arrested him, abvised him
to p'ead guilty.
"Guilty of what? ' asked Mr. Stutz.
"Of selling adulterated goods," sug
gested theotlicer.
"I don't know that they are adulter
atpd," replied Stutz.
He expressed the opinion that under
tlui law, as it now stands, it would be
necessary for the retailer to have an analy
sis made of a bottle in each case be tore
lie would feel safe in exposing the article
for sale.
Mr. Stutz announced that in order to
protect himself in the future he was hav
ing a rubber stamp made with the words
"Substitute for." These words he would
stamp upon little slips of paper, which he
wouid paste upon the label of each pack-
age. ,â .â â .â .;-:,-â ,â:.>-....,â¢â¢..â .â .â  â ;-â  â â â /â  --s. : -V.V

The following resolution was unani
mously adopled: ;,â¢ , : , ,- .-'
Ecsotved, That while we are In favor of the
enforcement of the puro food law, we feel that
the action being tnken at present by the
Bonrd of Health does great injustice to the re
tail grocer* of the City, fft therefore urge
that the Board of Health ad vise with the Re
tail Orooeri' Association and the Wholesale
Grocers' Association In order that the desired
result may be accomplished with ;he least in
jury to all concerned.
Supervisor John Lackmann, John G.
Nobmann (member of the Grand Jury)
ana Joseph A. Btutz were appointed a
committee to present the resolution to the
Board of Health and advise with that
body.
Siiould it be deemed necessary after the
conference, a mass-meeting of the entire
trade will be called at an early date to
take action in the matter.
THOSE CHINESE WOMEIf.
They* Are Preparing to Make a Lively
Legal Fight.
From all appearances the recent raid
upon ths dens of Cninatown is lively to
come to naught. Nearly sixty Chinese
women were taken into custody, but with
the majority it was a case of "hzzle," for
the authorities were obliged to liberate
nearly the whole of the batch. '
Not to be wholly outdone, three of the
youneer women were formally arrested on
the charge of being unlawfully within the
United States. These women claim to be
native daughters and therefore entitled to
be in this country.
All three cases were yesterday assigned
to Court Commissioner Heacock, who set
the cases for Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday next.
Bert Schlesinger, toe Assistant District
Attorney, will represent the United
â states. He has no easy task to perform,
for the burden of proving that the women
were not born in this country rests witb
the prosecution, and the women do not
have to prove anything. Major Moore ex
pects to be able to prove that the women
are natives of China. It is not likely that
he will succeed.
IS A LOCAL PKINTEE.
Theater Tickets ArÂ» Not Made Up In
Chicago, but in San Francisco.
John A. Beck of the Globe Ticket Com*
pany has taken exception to the state
ments ct certain paper-dealers that the
house he conducts is the agency of an
Eastern concern and that a laree amount
of money is sent out of Ban Francisco to
Chicago to pay for the theater tickets
used at local playhouses.
"In the first place," he said yesterday,
"I have a printine establishment of my
own and am doing just what any other
printine concern here does â buying in the
East that pan of the cardboard used in
the tickets which it is impossible to pur
chase here on this coast.
"The tickets are made and printed right
here, for the manufacture of which I em
ploy people who live here. In fact, the
ticket company which I have established
here, although it goes under the name of
the Globe Ticket Company, is a local in
stitution. I live here, my family lives
here and I am a San Francisco manufac
turer. 1 '

MASKED BURGLARS
ROB A RANCH
An Early Morning Visit
on the San Bruno
Road.
The Cottage of G. Bazurro &
Co. Ransacked and Plun
dered.
One of the Partners, Peter G:anbrnno,
Was CoTered With a Revolrer
Daring the Robbery.
Two masked men committed a daring
burglary at the ranch of G. Bazurro & Co.,
Sunnyside avenue, San Bruuo road, at
an early hour yesterday morning.
Tie partners are Peter Glanbruno, J.
B. Ferra, 1). Caselli and Albert RoÂ«si.
They Jive in a small four-roomed cottage,
and ei;:ht men employed by them sleep in
a barn some distance in the rear of the
cottage.
Ferra. Caselli and Rossi left for the
City about 1:30 o'clock yesterday morning
with loads of produce lor the market, and
left Gianbruno asleep in bed. Not fear
ing any visit from burglars, the front door
was always left unlocked.
About half an hour after the others had
driven away Gianbruno was awakened
from his sieep by two men, who roughly
shook him. He saw that their fuces were
covered with masks and each had a re
volver in his right hand.
One of them jumped on top of Gian
bruno and grasped him by the throat with
his left hand, telling him not to mttke a
noise or he would be killed. The robber
kept the revolver pointed at Gianbruno's
head and demanded where he kept his
money.
Giaubruno pointed to his clothes and
the other masked robber searched them.
He found $5, which ho quickly transferred
to his own pocket. He then went into
Ferra's room, broke open his trunk and
stole $100 in coin and a British bulldog re
volver. In Ros'i's trunk he found a new
pair of shoes and a silver watch, and
under the mattress on his bed $55 in gold.
In Caselli's room two revolvers were ap
propriated and a gold watch.
After completing his search for plunder
tho burglar returned to his companion,
and, telling GianDrnno that it he made
an outcry they would return and shoot
him, they toot their departure.
Gianbruno waited for a few minutes
ana then dressed himself and gave the
alarm to the men in the barn. He hitched
up tiis horse and, accompanied by one of
his men, drove to the Seventeenth-street
station, arriving there about 4 o'clock.
Lieutenant Burke was notified of the
robbery and he immediately detailed
31onnted Policemen McKenna and Carson
to scour the district in search of the men.
Taking two men with him the lieutenant
drove out to the ranch and made an ex
amination of the premises. He traced the
footsteps of the tno men through the
vegetable gardens and followed the trail
as far as the Fourteen-mile House.
There are crossroads at this point and
all trace of the men waa lost. Whether
â¢ they went further on or returned to the
City there was no means of ascertaining.
Tlie lieutenant and his men, after several
hours' search, had reluctantly to return
to the station, but he has not given up
hopes of finding the men yet.
Tney were described by Gianbruno as
both about 5 feet 7 or 8 inches tall, shab
bily dressed and wearing Fedora hats.
Bolh appeared to be young men and one
was stouter than the other.
Ranchers on the San Bruno road are
much excited over the burglary and any
one seen prowling around at nights after
this will meet with a warm reception.
A NEW STORE OPENED.
Fashionable Crowd at Livingston Bros.'
Completely Equipped Post-Street
Store.
Yesterday was opening day at Living
ston Bro9.' handsome new store on Post
street. This store, formerly occupied by
D. Samuels, has been thoroughly reno
vated and made in every respect what a
modern first-class house snould oe. The
aisles are broad, the counters excellently
arranged fur the display of the magnifi
cent stock and the attendents courteous
and obliging. Above all there is light,
the good, bright, all-searching light of
day. Not one dark corner is to be found
in the vaÂ«t establishment. The store yes
terday looked more iike'some fashionable
hall on the occasion of some swell gather
ing than a large new store ready to re
ceive its many new patrons.
At the entrance au arch studded in
marigolds was swung, having on its face
the inscription, "Livingston Bros. Open
ing day." On either side of the broad
center aisle was a floral horseshoe, com
posed oi roses and violets. Another
liandsome floral piece bore the inscription
"Prosperity," in bright red carnations.
Paims, cordons of evergreens twining the
stately columns and Easter lilies and
other choice b.osÂ«oms in exquisite vases,
combined wita the large crowd of ele
gantly attired ladies, contributed to the
handsome appearanceof the store.
The establishment has been conveni
ently divided into departments, wherein
may be found everything the shopper can
imagine or desire.
There is the shirtwaist, domestic, cur
tain, a most complete hosiery and under
wear, glove, Jadies', children and infants'
underwear, ribbons, laces, black wool
goods, colored dress goods, novelty, silk
trimming, notion and findings depart
ments. Last evening the exquisitely
drested show-windows were brilliantly
illumined and attracted considerable at
tention.
FOS OEIMINAL LIBEL
R. A. Tuttle Arrested on Complaint of
Rudolph Marquard, Saloon-Keeper.
Rudolph Marquard, a saloon-keeper,
corner of A street and Ninth avenue,
swore to a complaint in Judge Low's
court yesterday for the arrest ot Holland
A. Tuttle on the charge of criminal libel.
The charge is based upon statements
published in the papers by Tuttle arising
out of the arrest ana conviction of Patrick
Furlong, ano'.ber saloon-keeper in that lo
cality, for cruelty to a dog.
Tuitie interested himself in the prose
cution oi Furlong and became identified
with a movement of citizens to have the
licenses of the saloon revoked by the Po
lice Commissioners. It was alleged by
Tuttle that in Marquard' s saloon there
;.ad been a pr.z.-li^ht and several cocking
mains, and that his daughter, a minor,
tended bar.
Marquard alleges in his complaint that
the statements of TuttlÂ» are false and
prompted by malice. Tuttle was arrested
yesterday afternoon and released on $250
casn bail.

Mayor Ffaelan and Lippman Sachs were
especially active yesterday in a praise
worthy endeavor to arouse interest in the
boulevard project among the business
men of San Francisco. They conducted
a lystematic canvass and materially
helped to raise the funds in the hands of
Daniel Meyer to a grand total of $12,414 15.
Claus Spreckels headed the list of yester
day's receipts with a generous contribu
tion of $1000. Tha complete list is as fol

With amount previously collected, $10,
994 15. Grand total, $12,414 15.
Oat of this amount $1797 80 has aiready
been expended lor manual labor.
The boulevard where some of the erst
while unemployed are now bard at work
presented a scene of renewed activity yes
terday morning, when 400 eager men
started at their daily task. A portion of
these were set to work on a roadway lead
ing to the quarry where the rock will be
taken out for the macadam over the new
driveway.
The grading is well under way for nearly
a mile and only lacks a few more days'
work to hare an excellent roadway the
entire distance. Most of the hiils en
countered during the first part of the
work are practically leveled, the big cul
vert is nearly filled, and altogether the
work is progressing far better than was
expected.
Tuesday's contributions, other than
money, consisted of tools and material.
The Jnstinian Caire Company, I. 8. Van
Winkle and the George W. Gibbs Company
contributed picks, sledges anil steel. Yes
terday the Pacific Pine Lumber Company
made a substantial donation in the form
of 9000 feet of pine lumber. The commit
tee also wishes to thank the Sunset Tele
phone Company for patting in a telephone
in the toolhotise on the boulevard.
An offer from John Kelso of twenty
five or thirty cars and a mile of
track for use in transporting rock
from the quarry on the hillside to the
boulevard has been received, and Warren
& Malley and A. E. Buckman have encli
agreed to furnisn the committee with $100
worth of team work. With this the com
mittee will be able to widen the scope of
boulevard operations and employ a larger
number of men, of whom there are now
no less tban 2150 registered at the com
mittee's headquarters.
The men at the armory are trying hard
to realize that they are a duly certificated
corporation and are incidentally paying
the penalty of greatness.
Hitherto the organization has encoun
tered few rebuff* of serious consequence,
but its recent determination to enter the
field of competition aeainfct the regular
employment agencies has moved the lat

Help Supply Association allege, to stir up
inward strife and to make dissension with
a view to blasting its j'oang ambition at
its birth. One of the officers of the asso
ciation asserted yesteraay that emissaries
of these agencies are making a big kick.
"They want to throw down both the
board of directors and the organization
generally," said he. "One of these agaita
tors is a deposed member of the executive
committee and has drawn moreout of the ,
organization than any other man in it,"
Among the members ot the organiza
tion who have received work on the boule
vard is Vice-President Merrill. The readi
ness of one in his position to accept $1 a
day is referred to as sufficient to disprove
the contention that the men at the armory
do not wish to work.

Whereas, The State Legislature passed Sen
ate bill , approoriatine $20,000 to^estab
lish a State Hospital for Incurable Discuses;
and whereas, the victims of these dread dis
eases in this State are at present being cared
for in the so-called Pesthocue at San Fran
cisco, which Pesthouse has been in a dilapi
dated condition for many years, and to use
such a place to house human beings is a dis
grace to civilization and to our State,
Realizing the necessity for such an institu
tion in our State, and fearing that said bill
might be overlooker in the multitude of bills
now before his Excellency, the Governor,
therefore De it
Resolved, That we urge the Mayor and Board
of Supervisors of this City and County to
bring this important matterto the immediate
attention of the Governor and to urge him to
sign said bill.

ZION CHURCH MAY
BE REMODELED
Its Pastor, Rev. H. J. Callis,
Strongly Urges the
Movement
Meetings of the Christian En
deavor Convention to Be
Held There.
Rev. Starr King Was Once the Pastor
of the Old and Historical
Landmark
Rev. H. J. Callis, pastor of the time
honored and historic Zion M. E. Church,
is endeavoring, in conjunction with his
congregation, to find ways and means in
which to repair this building and suitably
arrange for the Christian Endeavor con
vention, which will be held in this
City in a few months. This chnrch,
which was erected in 1853, was the first
Unitarian church built in San Francisco .
A few years later this place of religious
worship became known as the Starr King
Church in honor of its pastor, Rev. Starr
King, whoso tirelessly exerted his influ
ence upon city and State to save this
State to the Union during the late re
bellion.
Ab cut twenty years ago the building be
came the property of the African Meth
odist Episcopal Zion Church. The build
ng has a seating capacity of 1500 and has,
on this account, been designated as one
of the many places in which the Christian
Endeavor convention will hold part of
their meetings.
"Many of our visitors," said Rev. Mr. Cal
lis last evening, "will wish to see the oid
Starr King Church, not merely on
account of its historical name, but also to
see if we are successful in our religious
endeavor. In its present condition it will
not reflect any credit on us as citizens.
The old church needs a thorough renova
tion, both on the interior and exterior.
Time has left the walls devoid of plaster
and decorations in many places. The
floor is sadly in need of paint,- as is also
the outside of the building.
"This old landmark could be made a
credit to the City with such repairs and
tne cost would not exceed $1000, but at
the present time it is a pitiful example of
neelect.
"Any and all aid that may be offered by
members of other churches, as well as the
public at large, will greatly belp me and
my congregation to raise our church to
the place which its history deserves."

HOMERS SOON TO
SOAR FOR GLORY
Enthusiasts Agog Over
the New Season's
Opening.
The Proposed Opposition Club Is
Not to Be a Reality
After All.
The Yonog-Bird Events Are on the
Mew Schedule and Others Are
Promised.
All is activity among the homing pigeon
enthusiast* these days, for the new season
is on, training oi the flying messengers is
in order, and everything is anticipation
for coming events.
There is only one disappointing feature
to mar the inauguration, and that is the
failure of the project to 'organize a new
local club. It was intended that the lat
ter, should it become a reality, would pose
as a competitor of the old established
California Fmeon and Homing Club, thus
making possible a year of interclub con
tests that would have afforded the pigeon
lovers no end of pleasure and excitement.
But the new scheme had to be abandoned
because of lack of support, and in conse
quence the season now opening will be
marked only by contest- between the
members of the existing organization.
These are all enthusiasts from the ground
up, so to speak, and they are making prep
arations to carry out a season of sport
that will eclipse all of their previous ef
forts.
The racing schedule for 1897 has just
been completed by Secretary Welch, and
includes at least two big events that will
stretch over many months. That which
is probably attracting most interest and
inspiring most activity among the
breeders, is the proposed young-bird con
tost for the Kuebne trophy. Several
months ago Otto Kuehne of Milwaukee,
one of the foremost breeders of homing
pigeons in America, sent a dozen of his
choicest birds to the San Francisco organ
ization, as a gift, but stipulated that they
should be sold, and that the proceeds of
the sale should be devoted to the purchase
of a trophy for which the members should
compete.
Under the arrangements at present
agreed upon this trophy will have to Joe
won three times in succession before it
will go into any body' b possession per
manently.
Just what this trophy is to be has not as
yet been determined upon by the club,
but it is understood that most of the
members prefer that it should be a cup.
But then this is a matter that will have to
be decided by a committee that will be
appointed on the evening of April 3, when
the club holds its next regular meeting.
Only this year's birds will be eligible to
enter into the contest for the Kuehne
prize, and they must wear seamless fed
eration bands stamped with the letter
"R, " which is the distinguishing mark
for 1897. The initial race is scheduled for
May Hi (Decoration day), and the flight
will be from Santa Rosa to this City, an
airline distance of fifty miles. The en
tries for this race will be received by Sec
retary Welsh on t/ie evening of April 3.
The second race is down on the pro
gramme for July 5, this time the course
being from Marysville to San Francisco, a
distance of 105 miles. From Fresno to
the home lofts will be the third flight, and
this event is set down to take place on Ad
mission day. The latter course will be the
longest of the three, covering a distance
of 170 miles.
Inasmuch as some magnificent birds
have popped into life with 1897 privileges,
the breeders are looking forward to some
royal iport.
The Kuehne event is not the only
young-bird affair provided for, however,
and not the only one that is interesting
the club members. The trophy that was
partially flown for last year still awaits a
permanent owner and still excites cov
etous notions. The dates for this contest
have been postponed till late in the year
in order that they may not trespass upon
those of the other events, and, besides,
furnish a continuous season's sport.
The same conditions that prevailed last
year will govern the contest again this
season,- and the rages will be over the
old courses. The first flight will take
place on September 19 ana will be from
ban Jose to this City; the second on Octo
ber 10, from Tres Pino> ; and the third on
November 7 from San Lucas.
No race schedule for old birds has as
yet been announced, but it is understood
that one is under preparation and will be
presented to the club at its next meeting.
The Croley cup, which was flown for
on January 10 last, over the course from
Sacramento to this City and won handily
by Dr. W. S. George of Antioch, is to be
formally presented to the winner, at a
special gathering of the pigeon enthusi
asts to be held within a fortnight.
SIMI AND KAVENI.
Amateur Prize-Fighters and Their
Seconds to Be Arrested.
Warrants were sworn oat yesterday for
the arrest of "John Doe Bimi and "John
Doe" Raveni, the principals in a prize
fight at a boxing club on Filbert street,
between Duponi and Kearny, at an early
hour last Sunday morning. Eleven rounds
were fought and both men were badly
pounded.
Warrants were also sworn out for the
arrest of four seconds, Guneo, Bacigalupi,
Murphy and "John Doe." They are all
charged with disturbing the peace.
The fight was an outcome of the cham
pionship battle, Sinii being a strong Fitz
simmons man and Kareni being equally
strong for Cor bett.

The "Great" Lightweight
Loses on Two Heavily
Played Horses.
He Grew Careless on InstaHator
and Was Beaten by
Salvation.
Ladies' Day at Ingleside Well At
tendedâFog Spoiled the Racing.
California Won in Fast Time.
The remnants of the iSloan confederacy
suffered a lew more reverses and were
greatly diseomiiud ere the afternoon
s-nort was over at Ingleside yesterday.
Wheu Tod Sloan arrived here from the
East, with volumes of flattering press no
tices in his trunk, in which he was her
alded as the world's greatest and only
lightweight jockey, he had a large follow
ing. He has proven an exploded "phe
rvoiu," which only confirms that Eastern
racing critics are about as good guessers
as Eastern pugilistic writers. He has
failed utterly here this winter to demon
strate that he ranks as higu in saddle
fork as two or three otner riders that
,iled to get their pictures in the press on
I .umeroua sundry occasions last summer.
f Sloan had the mount on Yemen, the
heavily played second choice in the second
event at six furlongs, but was outridden
and outgeneraled by "Skeets" Martin on
California, the favorite, and beaten three
parts of a length in 1:135-4. Yemen races
in the name of "S. Deiniel.' 1 The aged
sprinter's trainer, Frank Brown, was so
chagrined at his defeat that he bid the
winner, California, np to $1700, or $1100
over her entered selling price of ?600. She
was retained by her stable.
In the race following this, the mile
handicap, with a field of four starting,
Sloan cast a race to the wind that right
iully belonged to the 4 to 5 favorite, In
stallator. .
Tod jollied along in see-saw fashion
with Lobengula down the backsiretch,
finally passing that horse when straight
ened for the wire. He then took a wrap
on the Brutus horse, firmly convinced he
had the race up his sleeve. Then so re
nowned a jockey as H. Brown caught
Sloan in blissful repose and got Salvation
over the wire three parts of a lengtn in ad
vance of the first choice. The winner was
second choice in the ring and equaled the
track record for the distanceâ l:4o%.
It was "ladies' day" and the grand
stand was crowded to its utmost with the
fair sex. A heavy fog rolling in from the
ocean obscured a view of several of the
race?, spoiling what otherwise would have
baen a perfect racing day. Favorites ran
in hard luck, landing but two races.
Fourteen cheap selling-platers faced the
barrier in the opening six-furlong run.
Treachery was backed down from 5 to 2 to
5 to 2 favoritism, and failed to set any
part of the coin. To a good start, Per- |
haps sailed away in front and leading to
the paddock was oulv beaten out a head
in a hard drive by Brametta, a 15 to 1 j
shot, ridden by Jenkins.
The eight starters in the mile and a six- â¢
teenth affair were a very ordinary crowd, j
totally' lacking any pretensions as to class.
The bulk Of tbe coin went in on Doyle, !
sending him to the post an 11 to 5 choice, j
He, with McLiHUt as a close attendant,
made most of the running to the stretch,
where Adolph Spreckels, with Piggott up,
pradually forged to the front, downing
McLight by less than a length iv the slow '
time of L:SO& Foremost came fast at the j
end, taking tnird place.
In the hurdle race over one mile and a j
quarter, they were a sorry set of "crit- j

ters." Zaragoza was sent out a 3 to 2
favorite and issued from the fog in front,
but the last fifty yards was easily out
sprinted by the 20 to 1 shot. Hyinan,
ridden by Maynard. Herman, the second
choice, was third.
It was rumored that if Rey del Tierra,
the 3 to 2 favorite for the mile and a six
teenth selling run that was sixth on the
card, fell down, be might lose, but on no
other account. Wnen the bunch came
out of the fog bank, sure enough Tierra
was in front and finished half a length
before Altam^x, the second choice, in
1:49J-Â£. Babe Murphy was a tardy third.
In "the final six-lurlong npin, Pigeott,
aboard the 6 to 5 favorite, Bellicoso, ran
into a fog bank from which he could not
extricate himself and did not finish in tbe
first flight. Cfesarian at 6to 1 passed the
judge* a length befora tnÂ« second choice,
Lady Diamond, with old Logan capturing
the show.
NOTES.
California was not the only winner to
receive a boost. After Adolph Spreckels
had won the fourth race he was bid up
$400 over his entered selling price of $300
by George Berry. He was retained with
the usual $5 bid.
Joe Acton, the "little demon," who for
years held the .world's championship at
catch-as-catch-can wrestling, now an em
ploye of the Pinkerton Detective Agency,
stationed at Ingleside track, is anxious to
show his skill "on the mat again. â  Joe

She claims that the dogs barked at Andrews,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 1897.
KIENNA HAS A
WORLD'S RECORD
Lowers the Five- Mile Mark
in the Interclub Com
petition.
Stevens of lowa Captured the
Mi T e Handicap Profes
sional Event
Eaton Cha'lenges Any Rider to a
Match for a Big Purseâ Corbett
Will Try Cycle Racing.
The largest crowd that has ytt attended
the indoor cycle meet at the Mechanics'
Pavilion enjoyed a splendid programme
of racing last night. The sport was also
the best yet furnished, and there was not
a slip or a fall to mar the pleasure. It was
society night in a way, a large number of
the City's fashionables being seen in the
boxes. James J. Gorbett and his wife
were also interested spectators and stayed
until tne very last.
Orlando L. Stevens of Ottumwa, lowa,
! won the star professional event of the
I evening, the mile handicap. The handi
! capper allowed him 3o yards, a lead which
the cracks who lined up on the scratch
mark could cot overcome.
Commencing with to-night pools will be
sold on the professional events outside of
the building, as the Leacue of American
"Wheelmen's rules do not permit of pool
selling inside the structure in which a
meet is held.
One of the cards promised for next week
is a match race between Jay Eaton, the
"indoor king," and ex-champion James J.
Corbett. The latter ia quite a speedy
cyclist and Eaton will not be asked to give
him much of a handicap. It is not gen
erally known, but tie has competed at sev
eral meets in the East; once in a three
cornered match between A. A. Zimmer
man, champion cyclist of the world;
| Frank Ives, champion billiardist of the
world, ami Corbett, then the champion
pugilist of the world. It was a hotly con
tested ride and Corbett won in a close
finish, "Zimmy" second. As Corbett has
been using his wheel in his recent train
ing he is now in splendid racinjr condition.
After the races last night a meeting of
the men prominent in wheeling circles
and the cycle trade here was held, at
which resolutions were adopted indorsing
the present indoor tournament and com
plimentinjr the management for the high
standnrd of sport furnished.
The best racing of the evening was seen
in the semi-nnuls and final of the one
mile handicap, professional. The prelim
inary heats narrowed the field down to
twelve contestants, who rode in the three
semi-finals. In the first of these latter
were Eaton of Chicago and Foster of Cali
fornia on the scratch mark, Starbuclc of
Philadelphia at 86 yards and Morris of
Texas al 70. It was pretty to watch the
efforts of the scratch men to catca tho
leaders, and it took them four laps of hard
riding to do it. Foster started an early
sprint, but Starbuck -oon forged ahead
and kept the lead to the tape. Eaton was
second by at least a foot, but to the sur
prise of the audience the place was given
to Foster. The time was 2:40.
Becker of Minneapolis, on scratch;
"Bob" Terrill. Bay City, 20 yards; Stev
ens of lowa, SB yards, and Allen of Spo
kane, 90 yards, rode in the second semi
final. The long handicaps of the limit
men gave Becker and Teirill a hard race,
but they buckled down to their work and
â¢et a lively pace, covering the first half in
1:04. They could not overtake the leaders,
and Stevens and Allen fought it out at the
tape, tne former winning.
In the third were McFarland at 15
yards, Harry Terrill 30, Byrne 70 and
Bovden 95. It was a clever exhibition, re
sulting in a victory for Byrne, much to
the delight of his fellow-members of the
Imperial Club. McFarland and. Terrill
! fought for second place, the former win
| ning the position.
'Ih.s brought into the final Stevens,
Bvrne, Starbuck and Allen. Byrue and
Stevens soon caught Allen, but it was not
so easy for Starbuck, who took four laps
to do it, and was pretty well tired by the
effort. Allen made a gritty ride, setting
most of the pace, and made it good and
fast at that. Starbuck jumped for the
lead on the sixth lap, and Byrne, in try
ing to pass him on the inside, fell on the
west bank, but was evidently little hurl,
as he was up in an instant looking for the
referee to tile a protest, claiming he was
crowded down, but Mr. Welch could not
see it that way.
Stevees gained the front position on the
last lap and kept it to the end, and Allen,
who had been thrown out by Byrne's fall,
came like a streak and nipped out Star
buck for second money, so the latter had
to be satisfied with a cnod third.
After eight preliminary heats and two
semi-finals, the big field in the two mile
amateur event was narrowed down to four
of the speediest riders in that class. They
were: Kenna, Bay City; Delmas, Garden
City; Smith, Olympic Cyciers, and Mott,
Reliance Club. Each man wks required
to set pace at least once during each mile,
which kept them going at a good rate of
speed.
At the end of the sixth lap on the sec
ond mile Delmas lead, Kenna in second
position, then Smith and Mott. Kenna
thought it was time to move up to the
front, and he did it with a will, securing a
good lead before the others could start
their sprint. Kenna forgbd too far to the
front for the others to ever hope to over
take him, so it was practically a fight for
scoond place honors between the other
three. Delmas, Smith and Mott rounded
the last turn on even terms and had it out
down the straight, Delmas barely leading,
Smith getting third. The time was
5:10 3-5.
The five-mile club cup race, fourth night,
had three speedy contestants entered,
being J. R. Kenna, for the Bay City
Wheelmen; Bert Elford. Reliance Club
Wteelmen, and W. S. Bacon, Olympic
Cyclers. Tbo race was paced at a steady,
swift rate of speed by John Davidson and
T. A. Griffiths on a tandem. The first
mile was covered in 2:22. Two miles
were ridden in 4:32 3-5, a considerable in
crease in the pace, which was not dimin
ished, as the three miles were covered in
6:45 2-5. The speed got even faster, four
miles being left behind ing:s7 2-5. Just'
at the end of the fourth lap the rear tire
of the tandem exploded, but the riders
were too cool-headed to fall, and swung
wide to save the riders behind them, for
which they were liberally applauded.
Kenna immediately started his sprint,
and was i.ever headed, winning by at
least six lengths, Bacon second. The
time was 11:17 4-5, which is a world's in
door amateur record. Kenna rode the
last eighth in 13 1-5 seconds, another
world's record. He received an ovation at
the finish.
The following is the summary:

PROJECTED NEW
DEAL IN RACING
Possibly a Third Track
and Perhaps a Con
solidation.
Adolph Spreckels Said to Be
the Prime Mover in the
Scheme.
Turfmen Are All Agog Over the
Rumors, for Clean Sport h Once
More in Sight.
Evidently there is trouble ahead for one
Edward Corrigan, the turfman who once
earned some sort of a reputation as the
"master of Hawthorne."
During the past few days some mys
terious whispering has been going on
among those who represent what is known
as the clean element of the racing fratern
ity, and from these whispers rumors have
been born whicii indicate that a bombshell
is about to be exploded in local racing
| circles.
if these rumors are to be believed a deal
is on, the result of which will be either
the immediate construction of a new race
track in ban Francisco or the infusion of
new and more desirable blood into the
Caiifornia Jockey Club now operating at
Oakland.
By far the roost important element of
the story that is now being bruited about
is that Adolph Spreckels, late president of
the Pacific Coast Jockey Club and the real
founder and supporter of that organiza
tion, is one of the prime movers in the
new project, and that W. 6. Leake, who
recently resigned the position of secretary
of the inelesiiie concern, is also promi
nently identified in the scheme vith Mr.
Spreckels. It is not to be wondered at.then,
tiiat news of this sort should set the local
racing world agog. Mr. Spreckels has a
national reputation as a "square" sports
man of the simon-pure article â a man
who maintains an expensive stable and
races his horses for love of the sport
itself.
As long as he presided over the destinies
of the Pacific Coast Jockey Club as the
chief of its staff ot officers the public be
lieved that good, honest racing was as
sured, and, consequently, was a willing
and liberal patron of the game.
But there cams a change. Director
Corrigan had some innovations thai he
wanted introduced into the local racing j
game, and he was given his way about it; |
but President tfpreclcela and Secretary
Leake resigned their respective positions
and apparently stepped back into a pri
vate and commercial life.
It has been difficult for the fra
ternity of turfmen, knowing Mr. Spreckels
as they did, to believe that he could re
main lonj away from the grandest of all ;
sports', and this latest stoiy that he is now j
about to launch forth into a new racing \
project has set everybody interested in i
clean racing on the very tip-toe of ex- j
peciancy.
Mr. Spreckels himself is uncommun
icative. That U, he declines for the pres
ent to make public ; is plans.
He says in reference to the rumored new
race-track (tea!, that whatever business he
is trantacting nowadays is of a strictly
private nature. Should it eventually reach
that st&ce that would entiUe it to the
credit of being a public venture, he says,
he will gladly unfold its details. But for
the prfisent â mum is the word.
And Mr. Leake smiles, too, when ap- |
proached on the subject. He is still Mr.
Spreckels 1 private secretary and of course
knows what is oina on.
"I am paid by Mr. Spreckels to attend j
to his business, and not to pubiisn it to !
the v.orid," he said la?t night.
"I want to be kind to the press, bnt in a j
case of this character I must decline to be !
j interviewed."
The story that a new race-track is to be
built, making three in operation in or
about a city smaller than others which
have failed to support even cue
for but a season of a month,
does not meet with much credence among 1
those who are familiar with the status of j
the racing same here and the possibili- I
| ties of making money out cf it. They ]
rather incline to the belief that the new j
deal mean- a consolidation between those |
who lately withdrew iroru Corrigun's !
game and the chief magnates of the Ca!i- |
fornia Jockey Ciub. Such a move would !
mean a great deal to the racing interests |
now locate i here, and might mean that |
the Inpleside contingent would eventually ;
have to pack up and seek new pastures.
EEPUSED TO INTERPEBE.
Broderlck Will feign the Warrants of
Chiefs Crowley and Sullivan.
Max Popper callel on Auditor Broder
ick yesterday to request that the warrants
lor the increased salary recently granted
the Chief of Police and Chief of the Fire
Department be not signed on the ground
that the change in the remuneration of
the two officials was not constitutional.
The Auditor refused to interfere with
the matter, stating that he saw no reason
why the warrants should not go through.
He told Mr. Popper that tnere was a way
to stop the warrants by an injunction and
that be would prefer that to being com
pelled to issue thorn by a writ of mand:
mus sworn out by the officials. In tie
latter case he would have ihe assistance
ol the City and County Attorney, while in
ihe former he would be comptlled to hire
his own attorney.^
A Chineao Trick.
Chin Yee, a Chinese woman, went to the
Presbyterian Mission on Sacramento street
lost Friday and ssia she wanted to become a
good woman. Yesterday she was arreste.i on
a complaint chnrffinu her with concealing her
property with intent to defraud her creditors.
The complaining witness was Wong None.
Chief Crowley gave orders not to admit the
womnn to bail as he believed the charge was
trumped up to pet herbick to lead a life of
shame. The Cnief will inquire into the case.

word "hich" means high tarometrlc pressure and

refers to" low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by clondv weather and rain*.
â¢â¢Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
roast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and lÂ«w along the coast, and the isobars extend
north aad south alousr the coast, rain is probable:
butwfcen the -U/w Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able With a -high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weÂ«ther may be expected in summer and co.der
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK. N. V., March 24. â Depression
' characterized the trading at the Stock Exchange
, during the greater part of the day, the recent de
cision by the United States Supreme Court in the
Trans-Missouri Freight Association case having
created a decidedly bearish feeling on securities.
Reports that several Western roads were ready to
withdraw from various freight ana passenger
associations, in accordance with the Supreme
. Court ruling, started heavy liquidations in the
shares of the roads referred to. These issues were
â  most pronounced in the downward movement and
at pnt time showed losses of 2@2&g per cent.
â¢Rock island and Burlington and Quincy bore the
brunt of the attack. The general list declined
anywhere from % to 21 4 per cent, Tennessee
Coal, Louisville and Nashville, Big Four, Western
Union and southern P.ailway leading,
', London houses at first bought, but subsequently
turned slierj. and the liquidation by the for
eigners finally carried L. and M. down to
4ft %.- The shrinkage in values forced weak mar
pin-nolder* to sell, and the execution of stop-loss
orders accelerated the downward movement. In
the industrials sugar f>jll to 1 11 i- on increased
dealings. Chicago GaÂ«, in sympathy with the
general market, receded about a point, bat at the
decline supporting orders were forthcoming, and
the loss was partially recovered. In the final
transactions the bears made efforts to turn paper
profits into cash, and under the , process a sharp
rally ensued. Jersey Central an 1 Lake s-hore
were tbe leaders. Jersey Central rose from
to 871.4, and Lake shor* from 166 to 168. The
â¢itrength of Jersey Central was due to the publica
tion of Its February statement, whicb showed an
unexpected gitin in net earnings of over $30,000.
As a result of the rise in the stocks named the
market closed firm. 1 ransictions were unusn
ully heavy, aggregating 335.731 shares. Nee
changes show a decline of i4@lS/g per cent. Man
hattan and Jersey Central ami New York Central
gained Vs@Mi per cent. In the specialties Minne

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111- March 24.â Apart of yester
day's strength was missing at the opening of the
wheat market today. It was expected that se
vere weather â¢.voulJ prevail over the winter wheat
belt last olgnt, but quite the contrary was the
case, most sections reporting springlike weather
this morning. There was plenty of wheat for sale
at he start, and less of a desire to purchase was
evident. Liverpool did not offer the encourage
ment consistent with full sympathy, only advanc
ing Vi@Vs d against %c again in this market
yesterday. Receipts in the Northwest were again
liberal at 333 cars against 231 last Wednesday,
and 622 a year ago. Chicago received 12 cars
and inspected out 34.345 bushels. Closing Paris
cables were unchanged to higher, Berlin was lower
and Antwerp unchanged. Export clearances were
moderate at 293,724 bushels. May wheat opened
from 7314 cto 7sy @73Vic. declined to72VaC,
closing at 72%@73c, ya(b 7 /8 c under yesterday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow 19 cars. No. 2
spot, red, wheat ranged from S4V a c to 891/4 C, clos
ing about 85@>>9e.
CORNâ of corn were afforded moderate
comfort by light receipt 94 cars, and by firm
Liverpool cables, but the easy tone of wheat did
not permit of any particular spirit of strength in
tno other cereals, and consequently prices sagged
rather than advanced. There were no withdraw
als. Export clearances wer* again on a most lib
eral scale. 1,177, bushels being shipped. May
corn opened at 24% c, sold at 24y 2 c closing at
â _'4. r . â â¢. unchanged from yesterday. .Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow 95 cars.
OATSâ The oats market claimed no attention
other than what it received from the specialists in
tbU grain, It was affected by the air of weak
ness surrounding 11. but no significant trading took
p ace- Receipts were light a. 93 cars. There were
no withdrawals from store. Export clearances
amounted to 76, 447 bushels, May oats closed a
shade lower. Estimated receipts for to-morrow
82 cars.

PKO VISION'Sâ product market did not
respond to a strong tone in the hog trade, bat on
the contrary displayed an inclination to follow

demand. May pork closed -â 4,'J.{-2 C higher. May

UNION STOCKYARDS. I LI,, March 24.â
Supplies of cattle are increasing, about 32,700
having arrived here during the first half of the
week. - There was the usual preponderance of me
dium grades of half fat cattle, sales of which were
at barely steady figures, while* beeves that pos
sessed quality were altogether too scarce and sold
freely at firm prices. ' Exporters were buying fat
steers.
supplies of bogs are becoming much scarcer,
hardly 52,000 having arrived here so far this
week. Country roads are in such poor condition
that it is difficult to get country hogs to railroad
stations. Ii did not take long to dispose of the
19,000 hogs waich came in to-day, prices ruling
strong at yesterday's figures.
About b9,<300 sheep and lambs arrived during
the first half of the week. To-day the trade was

That the Deputy Was Easily

Oakland Office Saw Fbanctsco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 24. f
SheriÃ "White wilJ either be peaceably
admitted into the residence at 924 Banta
Clara avenue, Alameda, or he will break
down the. door, having been bo instructed
by Judge Ellsworth to-day.
In the suit of S. A. Speddy against C. 8.
Wright over some Alameda property the
deposition of Mr?. Olive E. JU Speddy .s
desired by the defendants. The lady is
seeking to avoid a summons, and the offi
cers reported that they nave never been
able to induce her to appear at the door or
to find her at home. This was represented
to Judge Ellsworth, and on motion of
for the defense the Sheriff was
W rected to serve the subpena forthwith,
if necessary to use force by breaking
' in the door and trying to discover Mrs.
Speddy, who, it is alleged, is being con
ceaied at the Alameda home.
For over a year the Speddy case has
been in' litigation and all manners of at
tempts have been made to serve papers on
Mrs. Speddy. One of the attorneys in the
case stated that Mrs. Speddy has a
daughter who closely resembles her
mother. In fact, it is said by the aid of a
very little artificial change the girl will
pass for the parent. Not long since a
very energetic Sheriff was greatly de
lighted to find the object of his search in
specting the roses in trie garden. He at
once entered the gate, approached the
Jady and in a very suave manner served
her with the papers which ue had carried
about so long. His chagrin may be im
agined when he discovered later that the
papers intended for Mrs. Speddy had been
served on tne daughter.
So cleverly has Mrs. Speddy succeeded
in evading the Sheriff's deputies that as a
last resort the court was appealed to for
tne purpose of authorizing tde Sheriff to
dispense with formality and serve the
subpena by the aid of iorce.
SUSPECTED OP INSANITY.
Mrs. Dolman's Neighbors Will Hare Her
Examined by Lunacy Commissioners.
Oakland Office San Fbaitcisoo Call,)
- 908 Broadway, March 24. )
â¢The suggestion in The Call two days
ago that "the mystery" of Mrs. Dolman's
; pets, who were cruelly tortured, might be
explained by her insanity, has proven to
be correct.
An officer of the Humane Society has
kept watch for four nights, but no one
disturbed the solitude and yet they were
just such dark and cloudy nights as a mis
creant would welcome. â¢
Officer Taggart has consequently become
convinced that Mrs. Dolman has com
mitted the acts she complains of, although
he has no direct proof of it.
'This morning Mrs. Dolman was asked
about the mystery and told a more pleas
ant story tban that of oojectionable de
tails bearing on the torture of birds. She
is a little French woman and she tells a
romantic story of her past. She says that
her brief but unfortunate married life was
terminated when her husband committed
forgery and was sent to San Quentin. At
that time she had a successful millinery
establishment in San Francisco, which
she- declares she sold to furnish attorneys
lor her husband's defense.
During the interview the woman im
agined that her cottage was peopled with
a gay company; that it was beautifully
furnished -and ready to start a restaurant,
' a pleasure resort and an ideal boarding
house all in one. She kept remarking
' that all this would happen if her enemies
. would only let her alone.
She has' the needles which were stuck
into the -birds' eyes, and the little bottle
with a Chinese label which she says she
found in the hencoop and which contained
the poison with which her birds were
killed. Her intimacy with the details of
' the torture practiced on her pets seems to
prove that she was the author of them.
She tells exactly how each bird was killed,
and even dilates extensively on the prop
. erties. of the poison used. . . BjKjjp
â¢ Her neighbors feel that the. little woman
is dangerous, and now that they are satis
fied of the source of her troubles they will
attempt to have her confined in an asy
lum. Mrs. Dolman recently requested an
Oakland attorney to take up her case, but
he declined, and stated to-day that he had
no doubt the woman was crazy.
BROKE THE PROGRAMME.
Commander Booth- I ucker Quickly Sat
isfies a Dying; Comrade's '>?gire.
Oaklaicd Office San Fbancibco Call, )
908 Broadway, March 24. )
Al-though every moment of the time
tdat Commander Booth-Tucker of the Sal
vation Army is on the coast had been
' carefully scheduled the wish of a dying
comrade caused the programme to ba
broken,- and the commander made a visit
to Oakland to gratify the desire of Mrs.
Addie Brown, who is hovering between
lUe and death at her home in East Oak
land. ;
Mrs. Brown, wife of Sergeant-Major
Brown, reference to whom has already
been published, was particularly anxious
to see the man who commands the Salva
tion Army in the United States once again
before she was, in army language, "pro
moted to glory." She expressed this de
sire to her relatives, and it was conveyed
to the commander. He at once declared
<hat the dying desire of a faithful com
rade was of more Importance than sched
uled events, so the progra name was broken,
and Commander Bootn-Tncker, with some
of the staff officers, paid a visit to the dy
ing soldier's bedside.
A very affecting little gathering was
held, and Mrs- Brown realized that it was
her last opportunity to shake hands with
the son-in-iaw of the man to whose com
mands she has been faithful for nearly
twelve years. A few farewell words were
epoken.but the condition of the patient
was. such that the doctor forbade anything
of an exciting nature, but her wish had
been gratified, and Sister Brown calmly
awaits the end, gratified that her desire
has been complied with.

THE SAN FRANCISCO OAL.L, THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 1897.
BOARD OF WORKS
WILL CAUCUS
Heads of Departments Are
Very Anxious to Kuow
the Result.
Lloyd Will Probably Succeed
Himself and Miller May
Do So
There Does Not, However, Seem to
Be Much Hops for Fire Chief
Fair.
Oaklakd Office San Frakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 24. J
The new members of the Board of Works
will hold a cam us some time this week to
try and agree on the distribution of patron
age that will be at their disposal after the
Ist of April.
There are, of course, many aspirants for
the heads of the three departments, but
it is more than likely that in one of the
departments, at least, all will be disap
pointed, while it is not beyond the bounds
of possibility that no changes may be
made for tne present at least
It has been published that A. M. Ben
ham, the partner of .Mayor-elect Thoma-,
will be placed at the head of the Street
Department. Mr. Benham will Bay
nothing about the matter, and although
there is no doubt he could have the posi
tion it he wanted it, it is probable that he
may not care about it
Mr. Miller, the present superintendent,
has received some encouragement that he
may be retained, but as he was placed in
office by the retiring members, Wilson
and Peirsoi, it is hardly safe to predict
that he will have the support of any two
members of the new board. When spoken
to about the matter City Attorney-elect
Dow said that there was a plank in the
Republican municipal platform to the ef
fect that the new administration would
not - remove officials who had proved
themselves competent, and that he pre
sumed the Republican majority of the
Board of Works would abide by the plat
form. Whether or not the recent objec
tions raised to Mr. Miller by the Mer
chants' Exchange will be made the basis
for removal remains to be seen.
There is a general desire on the part of
the public to retain Chief of Police Lloyd.
During the past two years the Police De
partment, with the exception of a few in
dividual cases which plainly showed the
personality of a member of the Board of
Public Works, has been creditably con
ducted, and the record shows that many
clever pieces of work have been accom
plished. There is, of course, one political
objection to be raised against Chief Lloyd.
He is a Populist and was very anxious to
see City Engineer Wilson reappointed.
Wilson was defeated and it is hardly liUHy
that Lloyd will get the stiDport of En
gineer Clement, though he may hold
office by virtue of the .Republican plank
accepted at the convention.
It has been taken for granted that there
will be a change in the Fire Department.
This assumption is probably correct Cap
tain Thomas does not owe his success to
anything done by Chief Fair, and neither
does Mr. Clement. While it is impossible
to say positively that the head of the Fire
Department took an active hand in ihe
recent campaign in violation of the rules
of the department, it is certain tnat those
little earns bearing the names of Wilson
and Dow that were circulated in the de
partment prior to election are said to
have originated with the chiel's knowl
edge. This may be true or untrue, but
the benefit of the doubt will hardly be ac
corded Mr. Fair.
Elbert Lawton, ex-chief of the depart
ment, is very anxious to get his job back.
He has some good backing, but was work
ing very hard in the interest of Mayor
Davie. He was also a warm supporter of
Clement, and as there are three members
of tne Board of Works and three execu
tive departments of the city government,
it is just possible that should the Fire De
partment be given to Clement, Lawton
may be successful.
TIRED OF HOME.
Grocer Morris Tells of Hit Troubles
With Hit Disobedient Bon â The
Mustard and Bastinado Stories.
ALAMEDA, Cal,, March 24.â According
to Grocer George T. Morris of this city the
tales published about his bad treatment of
his son have been grossly exaggerated.
He says that the boy is almost incorrigible
and has given him great trouble, and in
this he is borne out by several witnesses.
To punish him for lying toe made the boy
touch the tip of his tongue to some weak
mustard. At another time to punish him
he made him kneel down and then ad
ministered eight blows with a shingle on
the soles ef his feet The lad was continu
ally running away, refused to obey his
stepmother and conducted himsell in a
generally unruly fashion.
The boy wrote the following letter to
his father last month when he ran away
from home:
San Fbancisco, Feb. 9, 1897.
Hear Papa: lam with Cammie and lam go
ing io mamma. I don't want to come home
again, because I am always doing something
wrong. Minnie has been as good to me as any
stepmother can be, but I cannot agree with
her very well, and she has two babies to take
care of and can do without me. I am always
In bad company in Alameda, and I am going
where there are very few white boys and I
think 1 can do better there. While Fred was
there I could not agree with him, as be was
always teasing and mocking me, and I would
hit him and get Into trouble. He was always
taking my things and breaking them, and I
couid not keep him from it. Mease give my
boats and all my playthings to Ed Sinihan, as
he Is the only boy I can call my friend. I in
tend to do my best alter this to be a good boy.

J. F. Forderer ol the Board of City Trus
tees was asKed this evening for his opin
ion with regard to the proposed consti
tutional convention, which is to be voted
on by the people at the next general elec
tion. In reply, he stated that he had
given the subject so little thought as yet
that he was prepared to express no opin
ion as to the advisability of holding such
a convention. He had boen too busy to
give the matter any more than passing
notice, but he hoped to be able to consider
it fully before long.
Blight Have Been Serioug.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 24.â There was
a lively time on the 1.:3u narrow-gauge
train this afternoon, and many passengers
were badly frightened, though luckily
mere were no serious consequences.
Among the passengers were Albert Ky
noch, the sewer contractor, and I. N.
Chapman, the ex-city engineer. In some
way a dispute arose belween them, and it
finally resulted in a knife being drawn by
one of them, which was taken away by
Conductor Fielding and kept by him.
Kynoch says that Chapman drew the
knife, and that he (Chapman) called him
a vile name at first, whereupon he tried
to strike him, and then came the knife
drawing. Bystanders separated tbe angry
men.
THE COHEN FIRE.
An Offer Kefuaecl From the Water Com
pany That Would Have Saved
the House.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 24.â Further
investigation Into the origin of the fire at
the Cohen residence shows that it was
scarcely of incendiary origin. It was cils
tomnry to build fires in the house on
Bunday or at intervals to keep ont the
dampness, and such was done on Sunday
last. In some way, probably, sparks es
caped from the flues in the attic, causing
the destruction of the place.
In this connection an interesting fact
was learned to-day about the water sup
ply. Two or three years ago the water
company desired to bring a new main
into town from its works at Fitchburg,
and the nearest route to be followed lay
through the Cohen place. The company
proposed to the owners of the property to
lay the main along the line of what would
be a street continuation some time and
offered to put in a fire hydrant free of
charge,, and even to ran a pipe a
couple of hundrod feet, so as to have the
ping close to the bu lding. The offer was
refused and the company was obliged to
pay a yearly rental of about $100 for the
privilege of laying its pipe. Had there
been a hydrant as proposed the house
would undoubtedly have been saved.

TWO OELEBEATIONS.
Oakland Merchants to Honor the 4th
anil 13th of July. s
OAKLAND, Cal., March 24.â The vari
ous commercial bodies of this city have
decided that there shall be an elaborate
celebration on the Fourth of July which
shall embrace tbe whole county. Repre
sentatives from Alameda have expressed
the desire of that city to participate and
are anxious that a water carnival on the
canal be arranged. As tbe Endeavorers
have secured the netting aside of July 13
as "Oakland day" for the International
Christian Endeavor Convention, it was
finally decided by the allied bodies that
a committee of fifteen shall have charge of
the details and shall divide all subscrip
tions so as to have a celebration on both
days.
This execntive committee is to consist
of three members from each of the follow
ing: Merchants' Exchange, Board of
Trade. Oakland Exposition, Christian En
deavorers, National Guard.

MUCH APPROVAL,
LITTLE CENSURE
Jurors Believe There Was
Bribery, but They Can
not Find It.
Declare the Need of a Place
Where People Not Criminal
Can Be Detained.
All the County Institutions Are Well
Conducted, but the Courthouse
Is Dirty.
Oakt and Office Saw Fbahcisco Call, )
908 Broadway, March 24. )
The Grand Jury filed its report to-day,
and, as usual, three-fourths of the sensa
tional "rumors" of what was going on
behind the closed doors proves to De abso
lutely without foundation.
The report deals with those things gen
erally handled by grand juries, and gives
the same advice. Unlike many similar
bodies, it bestows a compliment on itself.
There is a word of praise for the County
Jail, and the city prison is said to be in
as eood condition as is possible under the
circumstances.
Regarding the County Infirmary the re
port says:
We found nothing to criticise in the manaee
mentof Dr. Clark and much to admire. The
facilities for fighting fire seem to be excellent,
and in less than two and a half minutes after
the alarm was sounded two streams were pour
ing upon tbe roof. We also suggest that one
more assistant be furnished iv the apartment
of the old men.
It is stated that the Receiving Hospital
needs to have at least 60 per cent addi
tional accommodation.
The inquisitors think there is need of a
change regarding the unruly boys and
girls sent to the State reform schools.
Tbe report says:
Alameda County contributed $2373 99 In
1895 and $4246 90 in 1896 to tbe support of
Children in me reform schools of the State,
being an Increase over 1895 of $1373, nearly
50 per cent. So large an Increase in the cost
is worthy ot tne immediate attention of our
Supervisors.
It is not unusual to find in the County Jail
boys who are not charged with crime, but who
are there because they have no home, and we
find in the City Prison some who are sick but
not charged with crime. Sucn things ought
not to be. Some place ought to be provided
in the county for nomeless boys and for those
who are sick and destitute and who are not
technically entitled to admission to the County
Hospital. We call especial attention of ihe
Supervisors to the matter, to the end thai
some fit place may be provided for them.
The jurors declare that there is no ade
quate return to the county for tne $125 a
month paid to the Game Warden and also
complain of the work of the janitors at the
Courthouse.
The Supervisors have been talked to
about their mileage bills, and it is be
lieved that there will be no more cause
for complaint.
The paragraph relating to talk of bribery
can hardly be called satisfactory. It
reads:
Statements were made so positively and fre
quently, on the streets and in public places
and in one or more instances In print, charg
ing the use of money and other improper in
fluences previous to the late City Conventions
for the purpose of Influencing nominations
that we Mil called upon to inquire into those
rumors and statements and loam upon what
foundation, if auy, they rested.
We had tbe matter under consideration at
many meetings and examined under oath
nineteen pertons, and while we have no
doubt that undue influences were used, not
enough was developed to justify any indict
ments. Meetings In offices by appointment
were admitted to have taken place and long
interviews had, but when brought before us
and iut under oath we were greatly im
pressed "with how much of what was said. the
witnesses had forgotten," and "how very little
they could remember." In some instances
entirely reputable citizens testified indirect
contradiction of each other as to what was
said at such interviews.
The report concludes:
It has become a common practice to speak
slightingly of granu juries and their useful
ness and tneir work, borne of the members of
this jury have served before, some of them
more than once, and we assure our fellow
citizens that in our opinion the money
Invested In grand juries by our county is well
spent. The fact that a grand jury is in exist
ence Is to a certain extent a restraint upon
crime, and it is public aotloe to all citizens
who have grievances that they can come be
fore such jury with their complaints at any
time and that they will be investigated.
We commend especially the system of ac
counts kept by Coutty Clerk Jordan and his
work generally. The District Attorney has
been prompt In attendance and ready to ad
vise when requested, and your Honor has
been twice before us at our request and has
fully explained the lan to us when requested.
We have mot on fourteen days and have aver
aged five hours' work each day.
We think that we have done our work faith
fully, and now request that your Honor dis
charge us from further service.
A HUSBAND'S DILEMMA.
He Told Stories to His Wife That Were
Not True.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 24. â The
charges against Miss Kate Murphy, a
saleswoman at Abrahamson's store, were
unfounded, and to-day's developments
show that Mrs. H. W. Trousdale of Chen
ery street, San Francisco, was misled by
tne stories of her husband.
Some time ago Miss Murphy met Trous
daiemSan Francisco, and believing him
to be a single man accepted his attentions.
Later she learned that he was married
and has had nothing to do with him since
that time. Trousdale told his wife, when
explaining why ne returned late at night,
that he had been seeing; Miss Murphy in
Oakland. His wife believed it, and be
coming angry started out yesterday to find
the saleswoman and obtain revenge.
Yesterday afternoon Mias Murphy and
her brother-in-law visited Mrs. Trousdale
in San Francisco while her husband was
at home. Explanations were made which
ended with Mrs. Trousdale boxing her
husband's ears in the presence of the call
ers. After a sensational scene Mrs.
Trousaale promised to write a letter in
justice to Miss Murphy explaining the
matter and to recompense her for the in
justice done. Miss Murphy has received
a very flattering notice from her employer,
who denies that sue was discharged and
s&ys that she left the store temporarily,
as any modest girl would after such a
scene as that created by Mrs. Trousdale.

OAKLAND, Cal., March 24.â A fire oc

Stoll Is Missing.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 24â Fred
Stoll, a butcher, is missing, and an at
tempt is being made by his Mends to con
nect him with the disappearance of Mrs.
Sheppler of Ban Francisco.
Before leaving Htoll announced to Gns
Romers, with whom he lodged, that he
was engaged to marry a girl in San Fran
cisco. Stoll was acquainted with Sheppler
and his wife before tbe two were married,
and now the husband has his snspicions
that Stoll is in some way connected with
the disappearances of Mrs. Sheppier, who
left her home four days after the wedding.
' Although tnere is little to support the
theory, he says it is just possible that
Stoil left with Mrs. Sheppler.
Garbage and Ashes. .
OAKLAND, Cal., March 24.â Within
the next few weeks there will be a tre
mendous business in ash barrels in this
city. At the next meeting ot the Council
an ordinance will be introduced making
it compulsory for housenolders to keep
their garbage separate from the ashes. It
has been found to be impossible for the
crematory to keep its contract with the
ciiy unless the refuse is segregated. This
matter will certainly meet with some op
position, as it implies a double cost to
householders for having their garbage and
ashes carted away.
Funeral of Jacob Cammeyer.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 24. â The
funeral of the late Jacob Cammeyer, ancle
of Assessor H. P. Dalton, took place this
afternoon. The deceased came from New
York last fall in search of health. He re
ceived great benefit from the change of
climate, but his disease was too far ad
vanced to permit of his return to health.
The pallbearers were Dr. George Pardee,
Paul Goldsmith, G. P. Daniels. Webb
Pierce, James B. Barber and Z. T. Gilpin.
Ebell Musicians.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 24.â The Ebell
Society has organized a choral section,
and may in the near future give a cantata
with orchestral accompaniment Mrs.
Fieissner Lewis, the director, is anxious
for the society to give a cantata during
May and to furnish the orchestra from the
Ebell membership.
Mrs. Smith May Recover.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 24.â Mrs. Ella
Smith, who had to be placed under
restraint on account of her , eccentric
actions by the sickbed of ber son, who is
near death from pneumonia, may recover
her reason. It has been decided to keep
her under restfaint for a time, to awaii
the development of her mania.
CORBETT AND MAHER.
The Olympic Club Is Anxious
to Match Peter and
Jim.
Fighters in Training for Contests
That Wi.l Take Place
Here.
Tne Olympic Club of this City is look
ing for some good fistic material. The
directors have been writing and tele
graphing Tommy Ryan of Syracuse,
N. V., in the hope that Ryan woula con
sent to meet Green under the auspices of
the Olympic, but according to late dis
patches a match between Ryan and
Green is as far away as ever.
Yesterday Douglas White of the Olym
pic Club bad a short chat with Tom
Sharkey. He asked the sailor if he would
meet Peter Maher in a limited round con
test, aad Sharkey quickly answered in the
affirmative.
"But," said Sharkey, "I will not fight
for a cent less tnan $10,000. I have been
offered that purse in the East by two
clubs, and I am waiting to hear what
Maher says."
Maher said the same thing when he was
in this Cily. but for some reason the
match fell through.
There will be a meeting of the Olympic
Club directors this evening, and Director
White will suggest that a pur^e of a very
tempting amount be offered for a twenty
round contest between Corbett and Maher,
and if the ex-champion will not consent a
purse may be "hung up" for a twenty
round bout between either Sharkey and
Maher or Ghoynski and Maher. The
friends of Choynski are very anxious to
see the game California heavy-weight in a
return match with the champion of Ire
land.
Now that Dal Hawkins is on Easy street,
having won a nice sum by whipping Fla
herty in Carson, his old opponent, Gang,
the colored fighter, of Baltimore, is look
ing for a match with the Californian. It
is thought that Gans is too heavy for
Hawkins, but if the clever colored fellow
will consent to meet Hawkins at 128
pounds and weigh-in at the ringside he
will be accommodated with a match.
George Green states most emphatically
that he did not wire trie Syracuse Club
that in case Ryan consented to meet him
he must have $2000 win or lose.
"You can say that I never made any
such proposal," Â«aid George. "The fact
of the matter is that Ryan does not want
to meet me. I have been trying to get
him into a ring with me for several weeks,
but I guess the prospects of a meeting are
slim. The Olympic Club of this City has
made a most tempting offer to Ryan, and
if he is game he will accept it. We will
know to-morrow."
The National and Pacific clubs hare an
nounced fistic exhibitions for April.
Aleck Greggains, who is matched to fignt
Stelzner, is training at Sargents station,
while his opponent is preparing for the
contest at the St. George's Club, in this
City. Bob Tnompson, the clever colored
tighter of Salt Lake City, who is booked
to meet Lon Agnew, is stationed at
Dunn's, on the Ocean beach. Agnew is
drilling at the Acme Club in Oakland.
Stewart Carter of the Olympic Club is
training hard in this City for a four
round bout with Frank Gilbert before the
Fjesno Athletic Cub on the evening of
April 3. They will fight at 145 pounds.
Lawlor of the Acme Club, who is slated
to meet Reno of the Manhattan Club at
the same place, is also getting into good
trim. Mailer of the San Francisco Club
is looking after Reno.
Jim Corbett will appear in Oakland on
Saturday erening. He will be assisted by
members of the Olympic and Reliance
athletic clubs.
Jeffries, the champion heavy-weight
of Los Angeles, is training at tne Acme
Club, in Oakland, for his contest with
Van Baskirk in this City. The latter is
at the Ocean Beach.
HIS OWN JANITOR.
Professor WÂ«nsell of the Board of
Health Pnta Rubbish In the
Corridor.
Chemist Wenzell of the Board of Health
has tangled up with the janitors at the
City Hall and ill- feeling on both sides is
the result. The janitors claim that the
professor analyzes the remains of defunct
animals in his laboratory and that the
stench is unbearable.
They complained to the chemist And the
latter iol.l them to go further, or words to
that effect. Then tbe janitors refused to
clean the laboratory on the ground that
the man who cares for the Board, of Health
rooms should do the work. This intensi
fied the feeling between the City em
ployes.
On Tuesday evening Professor Wenzell
took the rubbish oi his den into his own
hands and cast it into the corridor much
to the disgust of tbe janitors, and an Open
rupture was narrowly averted. The Su
pervisors will bear from both sides later.

California Psychical Society
Delving Into the Secrets
of Nature.
Experiments Prov ng the Existencs
of Animal Magnetism and Its Detec
tion by Hypnotiz d Subjects-
The Callfornlan Psychical Society is
now ready for active work. Since its In
corporation in November, 1895, it has had
many unfavorable turns on fortune's
wheel. Its membership ran up to about
100, but skepticism on one side and apathy
on the other seriously impeded progress,
and it was found necessary to prune off
tne dead limbs and give the tree of knowl
edge a fresh start.
The society has now an active member
ship of eighty-five searchers into the oc
cult. They are earnest and industrious
and will, no doubt, add much that is
valuable to the literature of the mystic.
According to the circular, the society was
organized to enable its members to pursue
systematic studies in the fields of meta
physics and psychology and particularly
to investigate the psychical powers latent
in man. It proposes to conduct systematic
investigations into the nature of numer
ous classes of imperfectly understood
phenomena, physical and psychical, to
account for which a generally recognized
bypotnesis has not yet been presented by
physical science. The announcement is
also made that in its methods of research
it will follow as far as possible the lines
pursued so successfully by the Society for
Psychical Research of London, Eng., and
the Society for Psychical Research of
Cambridge, Mass.
The work laid out for the society is on the
following topics:
An examination of the nature and ex
tent of any influence which may be exert
ed by any mind upon another, otherwise
than through the recognized sensory chan
nels. The study of hypnotism and mes
merism and an inquiry into the alleged
phenomena of clairvoyance. An inquiry
as to the existence of relations hitherto
unrecognized by science, between living
organisms and magnetic and electric
forces, and also between living and inani
mate bodies. By investigation of reports
resting on strong testimony, of appari
tions occurring at the moment of death or
otherwise, and of disturbance in houses
rtpnted to be haunted. An inquiry into
spiritualistic phenomena. Systematic
studies of the works of great teachers and
thinkers on psychical and metaphysical
subjects.
Tnis Is an extensive programme and in
volves an almost incalculable quantity of
research, but the work will be macie easy
because of the reports made some years
ago by the London Society for Psychical
Research and by the Boston society. The
California organization proposes to start
where the others left off and to clear up if
possible any doubtful points as to the
nature of hitherto unexplained phe
nomena.
The headquarters are now in 525 and
526 Parrott building on Market street,
where there are a library for the members
and a suite of rooms for tne purposes of
investigation. The office is kept open
from 2 p. m. to 4 r. m. and on Monday and
Friday evenings from 8 to 10. During
those hours the librarian, Miss Alice Gnr
nev Mahony, will be in attendance.
During the past month the society has
been experimenting with hypnotic phe
nomenon, two of its members, J. Daleell
Brown and M. V. Samuels, being expert
hypnotizers. It is expected that out of
these hypnotic experiments may be de
veloped important data with reference to
clairvoyance.
Miss Mahony told a Call reporter yes
terday of an interesting test made by the
society about a week ago. Six ordinary
drinking glasses were filled witn water,
and one of the glasses was magnetized by
Mr. Samuels. The magnetization was
produced by Mr. Samuels throwing his
hands down toward the glass, the object
of the experiment being to discover
whether human magnetism was a fact in
dependent of any hypnotic suggestion
given to the subject
The magnetized glass was marked, but
in such a manner that the subject could
not distinguish it from the others. Then
the subject was brought in and directed to
find it. rie took a sip out of each glass as
he wept along, but when he came to the
one which had been magnetized be de
clared that he-could not drink out of it be
cause it had the odor of rotten beer. Yet
the water in that glass was the same as
that in the otners and there was no odor
apparent in it so far as any of the mem
bers of the society could detect by smell
ing it.
Another interesting experiment was the
finding by the subject of a magnetized
card out of a deck of fifty- two.
Other experiments tending toward the
same end will ba proceeded with until
much valuable data will be collected.
Tbe committee on thought transference
will begin work next week and will pro
ceed to develop whatever psychic ability
there may be in tbe members.. Clairvoy
ance and clair.iudier.ee will be the princi
pal subjects of the committee's investiga
tions. In all the irork tbe plan of the
London society will be followed.

PURE FOOD THE
RALLYING CRY
Stricter Enforcement of the
Law of the State in
Demand.
Annual Meeting of the Manufac
turers' and Producers'
Association.
Directors Elected and a Strong Reso
lrr 01 Adopter! â President
Sonntag R tires.
A resolute determination to prosecute
the pure-food crusade by every legitimate
method was the most frequently expressed
and dominatine sentiment of the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association at
its annual meeting yesterday. President
Julian Sonntag referred to the subject in
his opening address as one of tiie most
satisfactory indications of the associa
tion's activity, and the unanimous feeling
of the meeting embodied itself in the fol
lowing resolution, which was presented
by Isidore Jacobs and adopted without
debate:
Whereas, The prosperity of the producers
slid dea.ers in tne food products of the State
of California largely depends 011 the purity of
food produced or manuf.-ic ured in this State;
and wheretis, the sale and distribution of such
food products is dependent both within and
without this State upon the coufidence of the
purchasing public in the genuinenessÂ«nd pur
ity of such foods and lood products; and
whereas, tbe public health, a matter of far
greater Importance, is dependent largely on
tbe purity of all loods; and whereas, nil of
the above advantages would be greatly
fathered by ihe enforcement of the so-called
pure-food law of this State and by satisiying
the world that adulteration of food in this
State would be severely punished; and wnere
as, the Board of Health is endeavoring to
carry out the said laws, with the iargest
amount of practical result?, nnU in such exe
cution and enforcement of the law it is likely
to find many practical difficulties; and where
as, the good faitb and right purpose of the
Board of Health in Us actions heretofore in
this connection are recognized and appreci
ated and approved, and meet with and will re
ceive tne hearty co-operation of the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association of this
City; t:ierelore be it
Hc.-olvcd, By this annual meeting of the Man
ufacturers and Producers' Association that
we will use every means in our power to assist
the Board of Ueaitn in tbecanying out and in
the enforcement of the said law, believing, as
we do, that the enforcement of the same means
better health to our community and the build
ing up oi the industries 01 our State.
Htsolved further. That invitations be ex
tended to ail commercial bodies throughout,
the Slate to send delegates to the Pure-food
Congress to be held under the auspices of this
organisation on Friday, April 30, at tne Cham
ber of Commerce.
The resignation of President Sonntag
was reluctantly acceuted by the associa
tion yesterday, and his successor wiil be
elected this afternoon by tne new board
of directors. The most popular candidate
for the vacant position is James W. Keir,
and it is expected tbat his appointment
will be accepted without opposition. Tue
new board of directors named yesterday
consists of the following gentlemen:
James W. Kerr, L. R. Mead, J. P. Currier,
M. J. Keller, Fr&nk L Brown. I. Jacobs,
Charies R. Alien, A. Suarboro, W. P. Bow
ers, A. McLaughlin, Samuel McKee.
The new board formally ratified the
proceedines of the annual meeting and
adjourned until this afternoon, when both
a president and the rest of the officers of
the association will be elected for the en
suing year.
In reviewing the work accomplished
during nis incumbency President Sonntas
stated that the board of directors met
thirty times, both in regular and special
meetings. Tbe fair held in conjunction
with the Mechanics' Institute was the
most largely attended one in the history
of San Francisco, 300,000 persons having
viewed the exhibits. The association bad
also been taking up a good deal of legisla
tive work, and had been the means of sup
pressine many obnoxious "cinch" bills,
in conjunction with the Council of Asso
â  ciated Industries. In the event of the
Governor giving Iff* consent the day was
not far distant when California products,
price and quality being equal, would be
U3ed in all btate institutions.
"'We have also endeavored to secure the
passage of a measure known as the South
wick bill through the House of Repre
sentatives," continued Mr. Sonntap,
"whica will stop tne importation of con
vict-made goods into the State of Caii
â¢ fornia. It is a well-known fact thai goods
to the value of mi.hons of dollars have
come here from Eastern penitentiaries.
Unfortunately under the ruling of the
Speaker of the House the Southwick bi:l
was not a privilege bill, and it is, therefore,
the hope of this association 10 reintroduce
that lueasure, if not during the extra ses
sion during the, regular session of Con
gress.
"Through our influence we have also
. prevented the State Board of Prison Di
rectors from employing tne prisoners in
any other work except rock-urushing and
the manufacture of jute bag?. This asso
ciation was also the first organization in
the State which took up the pure-food
question and directed tne attention of our
citizens to the great amount of imoure
. goods which irresponsible manufacturers
were dumping upon our markets. These
goods included hundreds of tons of jellies,
jams, etc, almost unfit for human con
sumption. At last we have a Board of
Health determined to prosecute the of
fenders vigorously, and we have done our
' Dett to assist It. California possesses vast
resources, but the fruit industry has been
almost killed, owing to the introduction
of these impure foods. If we can only
siop adulteration and compel our* own
manufacturers, as well as those in the
East, to live up to the laws of the land,
our products will find markets through
out me civilized world."
Isidore Jacobs moved a vote of thanks
to the retiring president, which was
eagerly accorded, and James W. Kerr
spoke appreciatively of Mr. Sonntag's
able services.
The meeting afterward adjourned.
THURSTON IS FREE.
But the Man He shot At Is Sentenced
- to Pay a Small
. Fine.
Jacob L. Thurston, charged with assault
to murder, was tried in Judge Carroll
Cook's court ' yesterday. He was accom
panied by his wife and child.
In bis defense Thurston said that he
was ' intoxicated ; and v d id not remember
having fired a shot.V The jury returned a
verdict of not gtiilty. , Mrs. Thursto'n wept
tears of "joy and kissed her husband. : ;
An amu.ing incident, which turned out
unpleasantly for. George H. Pettis, the
complaining witness, occurred during the
morning session. .While Pettis was giving
his testimony, one of the jurors asked him
what he did with the pistol that was on
him at the time of the assault, c;;^;;,
"Here it is," he responded, suitine. the
action to the word t and f drawing a loaded
weapon from bis hip-pocket. ..
- This caused a sensation, and Judge Cook
ordered Bailiff T. F. Wheian to lake the
pistol from I, the wuÃes>, remarking inci
dentally that 5 Pettis 1 was ? guilty of con
tempt of court and would have the privi
lege of paying $20 fine. ' : : - :'."â â¢'',; . 'â  '.'â¢'â¢
â¢ "But I nave a permit to carry the gun,"
said Pettis, instantly producing that docu
ment. ,â :.-â¢ '_ â -::â â 'â  / ..'..'"; â  â - â  â _.â ''.'â ':]â ! â :..'/ .-;â ..â 
â¢ "That does i not v excuse you for coming
armed into the presence of this court, and
especially wh"n Hvn>earing as a wijness.
You had'no right to bring the pistol here,
and you should m t liav^ drawn it in the
presence of the court in that manner," re
plied Judge Cook.
It was in vain that Pettis declared his
ignorance of the law in this regard. The
court would not change the order, but
Pettis may take his time to ray, as there
is no penalty attached if he fails to do so.

WAITING FOR
HUNTINGTON
No Railroad Rate War
Expected for the
Present.
VIEWS OF A SOUTHERN
PACIFIC OFFICIAL.
Local Action Deferred Until the
Arrival .of the President "
of the Road.
HE IS EXPECTED HERE IN A
DAY OR TWO.
A Decision Thai Has Thrown the
Railroad People of the Country
Into Confusion.
"No decision ever rendered by a court so ]
disturbed the railroad interests of this
country as the recent decision of the Su-
COLLIS P. HUNTINGTON.
preme Court of the United States, which
In substance declares that all associations |
whicn have for their purpose the mainte- j
nance of agreed rates and the division of j
traffic are illegal.
This i* the interpretation of the Su
preme Court of the anti-trust law pas-ed
by Congress in 1890, so far as it applies to
railroads operated in more than one State.
Among the associations that are affected
by this decision, and of which the South
ern Pacific is a member, are the Transcon
tinental Freight Rate Committee and the
Transcontinental Passenger Association.
It is generally agreed among railroad
people and their legal advisers that the
result of the decision will be to compel the
dissolution of all such organizations.
What tnis, in turn, will mean no one is at
present prepared to say. The fact, is ap
preciated that the decision is very far
reaching, and that if its effect is not medi
tied by some action of Congress looking to
an amendment 01 the law it will Have a
most disastrous effect on the railroad
properties of the country.
In view of the widespread trepidation
and confusion that has been caused by it
the most salient features of tlie decision
KEW 10-DA7.
My baby had Eczema in its worst form.
The top of her head was as raw as a piece of
beef, the hair eaten down to the scalp by ap-
plying tar poultices, and I thought if she ever
got well she would be bald. The best physi-
cian in the city attended her, but she con-
tinued to get worse all the time, and he finally
admitted "it was the most obstinate case he
â¢ bad ever seen," and that he was " at his wits' .
end." Some one suggested Ccticcba Reme-
dies, which I purchased and tried. In a few â 
days I noticed a great change. She continued
to improve, andfto'Saj/ is entirely cured, has
a nice bead of hair, is lively and hearty, and
the disease shows no signs of returning.* ' I
send you her photograph to show her as she
is to-day.

BEAUTIFUL SKiP^^^ "
I are again printed in The Call. Its vast
I importance was not fuiiv realized, even
i by those most directly interested, when it
' was first announced by the court on Mon
! day last.
Tne point at issue was whether or not
j the agreement of the Trans-Missouri
I Freight Association to maintain rates
within its territory was in violation of the
anti-trust law of 1890, prohibiting con
tracts or combinations in restraint of
! trade. Tfce court held that it was, and
must be abandoned. Justice Peckhani, in
rendering the opinion of the court, said
that the case presented two questions of
importance:
First â Does the anti-trust act apply to
and cover common carriers by railway?
Second â If so, does the agreement com
plaiued of violate any provisions of that
act?
The court finally held as follows:
The ij in-fit ion iione of law in regard
to the meaning and effect of the agree
ment itself, namely: Does the agree
ment restrain trade or commerce in any
wity no an to be a violmioti uf the act?
We have no doubt that it dneti. The
agreement on its face rncite* that it is
entered for the purpose of mutual pro
tection, and a violation subject* the
defaulting company to the payment of
h penalty.
While in force, and assuming it to be
lived up to, there ran be no doubt that
its direct, immediate nnd necessary ef
fect is to put a restraint upon trade or
commerce as described in the act.
Dispatches from various parts of the
country state that already a number of
railroad associations have decided to dis
solve and thai other companies have sig
nified their intention of withdrawing from
the associations to which they belong.
No form.il action has been tafcen by the
Southern Pacific Company, but this is
largely due to the fact that its principal
officers arc away, acting as an escort to I
Pre>ident C. P. Huntineton, who is on I
his way to this City. He arrived yester- j
day at Los Angeles and is expected to ar
rive here in a day or two in order to at
tend the annual meeting of the directors
of the company and at which an election
of officers is to be held. At this meeting,
which will be held within a week or two,
the subject of the Supreme Court decision
will undoubtedly receive a large share of
attention.
In view of the disruptions and with
' drawals that have taken place in the
I East, it has been reported that a rate war
of great dimensions is in prospect. This
j view is not held, however, by one of the
j principal traffic officials of the Southern
I Pacific. While this gentleman agrees
I with the opinions tbat the decision means
â  the dissolution of ail interstate irnffic ar
raneements between all transportation
companies, he believes that a general rate
var will not necessarily follow.
"No railroad manager wtio is responsi
j ble for the revenues of his company,"
' said this official yesterday, "will do any-
I thing to disturb the present situation, so
I far as rates are concerned. Nothing
; would be gained thereby except a loss of
j revenue and ;i large wear and tear of men-
I tal energy. I tfiinK that all the com
panies involved will await further devel
opments regarding this question. There
j has just been decided a similar case in
j the New York Circuit Court of Appeals.
j In this the interstate commerce act was
: involved, and the court held just con
j trary to the Supreme Court. The case
will now go to the Supreme Court, and be
fore the railroad people know what to ex
pect and what to do they will have to
await the decision of the Supreme Court
j in the pending case.
' Tne decision as it now stands is revo
luiionary in its character. It means that
! no line doing an interstate business can
j combine with another line engaged simi
i .any in niaKing a through rate lower than
, the combined local ratesof the companies.
I This would effectually prevent rail com
-1 petition with the Panama line or with the
Canada Pacific, and would work a great
hardship on all tne transcontinental lines.
1 No line would be able to quote a through
I rate, but would have to publish only its
! own rate, putting the shipper to the
; trouble of making separate arrangements
j witn each connecting line, between the
j point of shipment and the destination.
I Any company making a through rate
j would lay itself open to a charge of hav
j ing violated this particular act. It will
thus be seen that the enforcement of the
net will in reality work a restraint of com
merce.
"Instead of precipitating a rate war I
believe it will spur every manager wno is
responsible for the revenues of his com
pany to just an opposite course. I think
rates wih remain just as ti ey are until we
know definitely wnat to expect."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 1897.
WEEKLY LINE OF
STEAMERS TO JAPAN
S. Asano Returns Here
After Ordering Three
Ships in England.
The Vessels to Run From San
Francisco to Hongkong
Via Yokohama.
Elegant in Finish, as Large as the
China and Capable of Carry
ing 600 Passengers.
S. Asano, the wealthy president of the
Toyo Kieen Kabushiki, or Oriental Steam
ship Company of Japan, who was here
some time ago and who proposed to es
tablish a line of steamers between China,
Japan and this coast, making the ter
minus either here or at San Diego, is in
the City.
Since he was here he has been in Eng
land, and has ordered three elegant, mod
ern steamships for his line. Each is as
large as the steamer China and capable of
carrying 600 passengers, besides having
a dead- weight capacity of 5000 tons for
freight.
Mr. Asano is well pleased with big trip.
He says he will make this City the ter
minus of his steamer line, and that if
there is business enough he will dispatch
a steamer from here every week, as it will
only take three weeks for one of the new
steamers to cross the ocean between here
and China, via Japan.
When Mr. Asano left here several
months ago he had figures from the
Union Iron Works and the Cramps for
the building of his steamers. On arriv
ing in England, however, he found the
vessels could be constructed cheaper
there, and so gave the contracts. He says
the steamers will be finished and back
here, ready to start, in just about a year
from this time.
Since, his arrival he and his secretary,
K. Kobayashi, have been conferring with
leading merchants and visiting the State
Board of Trade and Chamber of Com
merce, and gathering what information
they could about the business that might
be expected for the line.
"I propose to establish a regular lin<Â»
between China, Japan and San Francisco,"
said Mr. Asano last night. "I think there
will be enough business to support it wen.
The ships I have ordered are twin-screw
steel vessels, each of 6000 tons gross ton
nage. They are to be sis;er ships. Each
will accommodate 68 first-class passen
ger.*, 40 second-class and 48C steerage. I
cannot yet tell what rates I will make.
The dead weight cargo capacity will be
5000 tons.
"These vessels are now being built on
the northwest coast of England â two at
Sunderland and the third at Newcastle
on-Tyne. The steamers will all be alike
and a little larger than the China, so well
known here. They will be able to make
seventeen knots an hour.
"They will run from Hongkong (in
cluding possibly Shanghai) via Yoko
hama and Kobe, and possibly Honolulu,
to San Francisco. This will be the und of
the line. There is no prospect now that
we will run to San Dieeo. I looked into
that carefully and finally pave it up. This
is the t>iace. :>
Mr. Asano was asked about the San
Diego telegram which said that an enor
mous tract of land bad been secured in
Chiapas, Mex., by Sho Nemoto for coloni
zation purposes and would be colonized
by Japanese; Also that steamers might
be made to run to Tehauntepec, connect
ing with the railroad and remotely with
the colony. He said about 1,000,000 acres
had been secured, so he understood, but
he did not know ttic details. As for the
Tehanntepec steamship venture, he said
the harbor was not at present deep enough
and would have to be improved before the
enterprise was feasible.
Mr. Asano is a millionaire many times
over. He is heavily interested in pe
troleum in Japan, in the manufacture of
cement, in shipping and many other en
terprises. He occupies a suite ol four
luxurious rooms at the Palace.

The Jury in the Slavich Dam
age Case Fails to
Agree.
It is Understood T! at They Stood 7
Against 5 in Favor of the
Plaintiff
The case of Andrew Slavich against the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company,
which began trial before Judge Bahrs on
Monday, went to the jury late last even
ing. About midnight the jury was called
in and, having announced that there was
no possibility of an agreement, was dis
charged. It was ascertained that the
jury stood 7 for the plaintiff And & for the
defendant.
In the three days' trial the ground of
complaint and the defense of the company
were cone over with great care by the
counsel in the case, Jonn E. liichards for
the plaintiff and General Barnes for the
defendants, and in their respective argu
ments before the jury the facts as drawn
from the witnesses â assuming them to be
facts â were summed up and presented
from their respective points of view.
Blavich was very badly injured by being
run into by a Southern Pacific train on
Center street, San Jo"", on the alternoon
of the Ist of July, 1895. He'is a cripple,
unable to move about without the aid of
crutches and his physician declares he
will remain so for life.
lie told the story on the witness-stand
in this wise: He is a fruit and vegetable
peddler, and on the afternoon in question,
having disposed of his goods, he was
making his way home quits leisurely, his
little eleven-year-old boy driving and he
himself sitting in the body of the wagon.
As they crossed the tracks of the Southern
Pacific narrow-gauge on Center street,
father and ion noticed at the same time
the approach of an engine am! train, com
ing at a lively pace. They attempted to
whip up the horse, but before they could
get out of danger the engine was upon
them and struck the wagon and the man
who fell from it. The tire of a wheel was
Knocked from the wagon, the horse ran
away, with the boy in the seat, yelling
with fright.
The train was stopped and Slavich, half
unconscious, was picked up from under
the third car. He was in a terribly bat
tered condition, blood flowine from a
severe gash in the head, four of his ribs
were broken and bis shoulder and his hip
dislocated. For months he was confined
to bed, and he is still and will always be a
cripple.
The question of neglect or responsi
bility for the accident was that upon
which the case hinged, of course. The
prosecution introduced a half dozen dis
interested witnesses who were in the im
mediate vicinity and who declared the
train was running from seven to fifteen
miles an hour whan it came round the
curve in sight of the wagon, and that no
warning bell or whistle was sounded.
They saw Siavich and bis son trying to
put speed in the horse and fail until the
engine struck and did the damage.
On the other hand, the trainmen swore
that the bell was ringing as the train came
on, and that the latter was moving very
slowly. They insisted that the wagon
was standing still within six feet of the
train when it came along and that Ihe
horse backed into tne baggage-car, causing
the damage.
Mr. Richards in his argument enu
merated the points in the controversy
upon which there was no dispute; that
there had been an accident; that Siavich
had been greatly Injured ; that Siavich,
with bis wagon, had an equal right with
the Southern Pacific train to the use of
the street; that the time of the accident
was the afternoon of a bright and calm
summer day.
In support of his charge of negligence
on the part of the company he cited the
witnesses who declared there had been no
warning signal; he pointed to the condi
tion of tie victim who bore the marks of
a collision with a swift-moving engine.
He called attention to the fact that all
the witnesses who testified that the warn
ing bell was ringing ami that the train
was moving at the snail's pace that per
mitted the wagon to back into it at almost
a standstill were men whose occupations
would be gone did they not so testify;
whose every interest it was to so declare.
General Barnes, on the other hand, also
offered the plaintiff himself in evidence
that the train could not have been movinz
fast, declaring that had it been he and
his wagon would both have been scattered
along the highway, a wrecked mass.
The engineer sounded the warning bell
at places of danger with the same auto
matic regularity with whicti he breathed.
"Of course the bell was ringine," he
said. "Why shouldn't it be?' He char
acterized the c.'aims of the plaintiff and
bis counsel as absurd and unreasonable.
Both counsel offered points of law to be
incorporated in the court's charge, and at
half-past 5 o'clock the case was given to
the jury. _________ _______
SERIOUS ACCUSATIONS.
Sirs. Pettee and Mrs. Greenwood Claim
the Matter's Grandson Was J'.ail
roaded to Confinement.
The case of little George Edwin Morris,
son of George Morris, the Alameda County
grocer, seems in a fair way to stir up a
great deal of trouble, as it has already
reached the excitement stage. The story
of bow the boy, who is only 12 years of
age, ran away and came to his grand
mother in this City on account of alleged
cruel treatment received at the hands of
his father has already been told.
Yesterday the grandmotner, Mrs. S. M.
Greenwood, who lives at 829 Francisco
street, came before tne ofliciaJs of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children and asked their intervention in
behalf of the boy, who she said had been
taken to Alnmeda and railroaded to the
Boys' and Girls' Aid Society for three
months. She was accompanied by Mr?.
John Pettee, who also was very indignant.
Among the charges the boy and hi 3
grandmother make against the father is,
that he forced ttie boy to eat mustard un
til his mouth was raw, stood him on his
head, beat him across the soles of his bare
feet, and otherwise maltreated him be
cause he could not agree with bis step
mother.
Mrs. Pettee asserts that the boy's mouth
was in a fearful condition when he was
brought under her charge by the grand
mother. She also is very indignant at
the father, who she asserts threatened
her for the interest she took in the boy.

CAEPES TEES' DIBTEIOT COUNCIL
It Deplores the Practice of Letting Con
tract* to Eastern Firm*
A meeting of the District Council of tbe
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of
America was held laet evening at 102
O'Farrell street.
A long resolution was passed reciting
that a large portion of those who follow
carpentering for a living in this and ad
jacent cities are without employment be
cause tbere is no work to be obtained.
They deplored the practice of local cap
italists in letting contracts to firms, the
members of which reside in Eastern cities,
thereby depriving local carpenters of tbÂ«
work which they consider rightly belongs
to them. An instance cited in the resolu
tions refers to one of the Spreckels build
ings, the inside work of which has been
let to a Chicago firm. The resolution was
concluded by a general condemnation by
the District Council of the practice com
plained of.

The Merchants' Association is much pleased
to liml that its efforts in behalf of better
pavements are meeting with practical success.
At tbe recent meeting of owners of property
abutting cobbled pavements It was decided to
contribute one-half of the expense of repay
ing these blocks. The City agreed to contribute
the other half. The property-owners on Geary
street, between Kearny and Powell, having
agreed to this proposition, the Board of Su
pervisors has now pu blished the resolution of
award for the repavement of these three
blocks with modern bituminous pavement. A
bond will be given by the contractors guaran
teeing to keep these blocks in good n- pair for
a period of five years without any further cost
or expense to the City. It is expected that the
repavement of these three blocks will be soon
followed by the improvement of all the other
downtown streets that are now covered with
coboles.
