Captaia Lees Tels How the Mur
derer Was Tracked to the
Loae Star State.
If any doubt existed in the mind of
Captain Lees that Arthur Forbes, the
schoolteacher at Kooperl, Texas, now in
jsil at Meridian, Texas, was Josef E.
Blanther, the cold-blooded murderer of
Mr?. Puilopena Langfeldt. it, was entirely
removed yesterday morning by the re
cpipt of a letter from W. A. Boyd, Sheriff
of Bosqvie County.
Inclosed in the letter was a note written
by Arthur .Forbes on February 1 with the
object of showing the captain the hand
writing ol the suspect. The note reads as
follows:
KOPPERL. Feb. 1, 1897.â Mr. P. P. Greer,
Meridian, Texasâ My Dkak Sir: I forward by
evening mail my report to the county judge
and take Hgain the liberty of asking the favor
of you to kindly collect the voucher for me at
the bank and to send me the money by ex
press.
Thauking you in advance for your kindness,
I beg to subscribe faithfully yours
Arthce Fokbes.
The captain, on looking at the band
writing, was at once convinced that the
writer was Blanther. There were the Â«ame
characteristics as in the writings of Blan
ther in the eaptafn's possession and in the ;
letter written by BJanther to the Chron
icle ta Mar fast. TnÂ« formation of the
capital *'T" and "F," the small "s," the
peculiarity of putting a dot and dash at
the end of a sentence, and the general
character of the letter led irresistibly to
the conclusion that Arthur Forbes was j
Blantber. There is a marked resemblance I
also 'in the name "Forbes," as written on
the ticket purchased by Blanther for El
Paso ajid in the note to P. P. Greer re
ferred to.
Bianther's attempt to end his life by
swallowing a dose of morphine in the
Meridian jail Sunday morning was not
successful. Captain Lees yesterday morn
ing received the following dispatch, which
was the first official information sent him
of the. attempted suicide:

him through. Now out of danger. Your men
not, here. W. A- Boyd, Sheriff.
Now tnat Captain Leea is satisfied tnat
Forbes is Blanther he feels inclined to
speak of the incidents that led up to his
i.rre-t.
After B. anther left Ei Paso during his
Sight from this City he was recognized by
a detective at Fort Worth, who traveled
with him for two or three hours over the
Texas and Pacific road. At that time no

The San Francisco Call

was unaware of tiie fact that he had Deen
traveling with the murderer till he saw
the circular with his piciure a week or two
afterward at the police station at Fort
Worth. He immediately notified Cap
tain Lse? of the fact.
The next beard of Bianther was when
the Chronicle received a letter from him
postmarked Atlanta, (ia., purporting to
have been written on the train, and giv
ing the impression that he was to embark
on a sailing vessel for Cuba. The letter
was 5-ent by B anther to Atlanta to a
friend 10 be posted, and it is supposed the
mend was Addie Walker, alias Aduie
Harper. Addle Hertel or Anna Forbes,
who had been consorting with Bianther.
This was the last positive information
heard of Bianther, although tbera were a
number of false alarms till Monday,
March 15, when Captain Lees received a
dispatch irom Sheriff Boyd of Meridian
that Arthur Forbes, a scaooi-teacher at
Konperl, Texas, wa- under arreat in Me
ridian jail on suspicion of being Bianther.
What led to the suspicion of the officials
at Meridian was a copy of the last circu
lar sent out by Captain Lees, which was
published in full on the first page of this
months issue of The Detective, or
month. y po.ice paper, published in Chi
cago, and wiiich is sent to every police de
partment in the United Slates. Along
with tlie circular, which gave a full de
scription of Bianther, was a picture of him,
taken irciu a photograph by Brund, Chi
cago, February 11, 18'J1, while Bianther
was living in the Windy City. The circu
lar referred to the fact that while ia Texas
or Chicago BUnther consorted with Addie
Walker, who had lived at Atlanta, Ga.,
and was last heard from at Kuoxvilie,
Term., her former home being with her
grandmother, Mrs. E. E. Stewart, Texar
kana, Tex., and that she migat join Bian
ther in his flight.
Blanther and Addie Walker, who passed
as Mrs. Forbes, first appeared in Kopperi
in July or August last, and he secured the
position of teacher in the school. They
lived quietly and unostentatiously till
December, when the woman left Kopperi,
telling her friends there that sue was
going to pay a visit to her grandmother
in Texarkana. That was the last seen of
her. She had toid these friends that her
maiden name was Addie Walker.
When the police paper reached Merid
ian the strong resemblance of Arthur
Forbes, the Kopperi teacher, to the pnoto
graph in the circular, and the fact that
the maiden name of his wile waa Addie
Walker, ied to the arrest.
The dispatches .to Captain Lees men
tioned all these facts, and although he
felt almost certain there could be no mis
take he intended not to make the arresi
public till Detective GiDson and George
Dodge had an opportunity of ideuuiying
Blamher.
it took the captain over five months'
hard work to get the Brund pnoto and a
month longer to get positive information
as to Addle Walker's relations with
Blanther, but with these in his possession
and the complete description of the mur
derer ar.d iua past hie he tait sura th*L it
alive he wouid be captured in time.
"I have insisted all the time," sail the
captain yesterday, "that Blanther never
left the Slate of Texas, and I was in con
stant communication with the officials In
the different counties to keep a sharp
lookout for him.
"It was the Brund photo and the woman
Addie Walker that led to the capture, but
I had months of hard work before obtain
ing possession of thess two important
points.
"I expect to hear from Detective Gibson
at any moment, and as soon as Blanther
is identified Gibson will go to Dallas to get
the extradition papers signed by Governor
Culberson and then will return to Meri
dian and bring the murderer back."
Captain Lees remained in his office late
! last night in the hope of receiving a dis- ]
i patch from Detective Gibson, but it did j
I not materialize. He and Dodge were ex- '
; pected in Meridian last night, but it is I
j probable they have been delayed.

ATLANTA, Ga., March 22.â A special
to the Constitution from Arlington, Ga.,
says: A cyclone struck this town to-day
and left benind it a trail of death
and disaster. The Academy building was
blown to pieces, and from tha wreck
nearly a hundred dead, dying and injured
people have already been taken. Among

jured. Not a single soul in the big build
ing escaped injury.
There was a lull in the high winds
which had prevailed, giving some promise
of a clear day. Professor Coring ton, go
ing out to look around, beheld a dark
cloud well fringed withelectricity moving
rapidly in the direction of the school. His
trained eye at once told him there was
danger. Hurrying the children into the
building for safety, the roaring of the com
ing cyclone was upon them before they
had time to think. The storm gained in
strength and velocity, and the building
began to shake and careen as if rocked in
the arms of a mighty force. The building
was wrenched into fragments so that the
pieces fell inward, and among the first
struck was Claude Roberts and Alice Put
nam, who were knocked into insensibility
of death at the first blow.
Little Willie McMurra had been caught
under the heavy timber ana the life was
crushed out of him. Kenneth Boynton
was the next who was seen vainly endeav
oring to escape from the death trap, but
too late, for the fatal blow had been
struck.
Professors Covington and Walker both
worked hard to rescue tbe Jittle ones,
notwithstanding their serious injuries.
The scene was soon surrounded by the
parents of tbe children. The sight' of
eight little ones already dead and of ten
others crusned and bruised and bleeding
in all the phases of torture was enough to
wring the stoutest heart. Among those
wonnded quite a number are not expected

most shocking disaster which has ever
occurred in this section.

caused by the storm still exists, and dur

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 22.â Tariff
debates are noi the attraction they once
were in the halls of Congress. When
Speaker Reed called the House of Repre
sentatives to order to-day much less than
half the members were in their seats, and
only a sprinkling of visitors was seen in
the galleries. The Speaker said: "Pur
suant, to the order adopted, the House
will now resolve itself into committee of
I the whole for consideration of tariff bill
i No. 379, and the chair will appoint the
gentleman from New York, Sherman,
chairman o! the committee."
Sherman tcok the chair and directed
the clerk to read the bill in extenso, which
occupied two hours, reducing by that
much the period for the debate.
The reading of the bill closed at 12:20
o'clock, and then Dingley of Maine, chair
man of the Committee on Ways and
Means, proceeded to address the House in
support of the measure. He spoke as ioi
lows:
Congress has been convened in extraordi
nary session by the President tor the purpose
of providing adequate revenue for carrying
on ihe Government. The exigency which has
brought us here is so clearly stated in the
message of the President and is so fully recited
| in the report of the Committee on Ways and
| Means submitting the pending revision of
â  tariff for the consideration of the House that I
I need not detain you repeating the story so
completely within your own knowledge. The
salient facts are these:
1. In the four fiscal years commencing July
1, 1893, and closiug on June 30 next, the reve
nue of the Government has been insufficient
to meet the expenditures to the extent of more
than $200,000,000, or on an average of $dO,.
000,000 per annum.
2. The late Secretary of the Treasury, in hia
late annual report, estimates that under exist
ing conditions this deficiency will continue
and will reach $45,000,000 more the next
fiscal year.
3. This deficiency of $200,000,000 up to the
close of the present fiscal year has been met by
borrowing. That is, of the $293,500,000
realized from the sale of 262,333,000 dollars'
worth of bonds sold in tne last administration,
over $200,000,000 has been used to pay cur
rent expenditures in excess of revenue.

same thing) the United States demand notes

redeemed witn the gold obtained by borrow
ing, has promoted distrust, intensified and
prolonged the run on the treasury aud de
stroyed Dusiness con^deace.
5. This deficiency of revenue has nearly
ali risen from a tailing off of revenue from
various imports, and not irom a decline of
revenue from internal taxes. Since the result
of the National elections in November, 1892.
first forecasting and subsequently partially
accomplishing a revolutionary change ot tariff
policy began to arrest industries. In the fiscal
year beginning July 1,181)2, the revenue de
rived from the duties on imports was $203,
---000.00 increase of $26,000,000 over the
previous yearâ and up to November, 1892, it
was the confident expectation of the then Sec
retary of the Treasury that tne revenue in the2
succeeding fiscal year would reach .*220,
---000,000; but this expectation was bl sied
when anticipated tariff legislation that would
largely reduce duties began to defer Importa
tions and subsequently to disorganize indus
tries.
In the light of this course of events and in
the face of the chronic dt-ficieucv requiring im
mediate relief, the ' Committee of Ways and
Means bÂ«s reported the pending bill to revise
-the tariff for the ends indicated by the title,
to wit, to provide additional revenue to carry
on tbe Government,. and at the same time, in
aojustiug the duties, to encourage the in
dustries of the United Ststes. la this re
vision the committee has endeavored to dis
card mere theory", aud has addressed them
selves to tbe framing of a practical remedy,
at least in part, for . the il'.s which have
for so mauv.- months -overshadowed the
country. It is"a conditiO' and not a theory
which confronts us." â¢ Our problem is to pro
vide adequate revenut from duties on imports
to carry on the Government, and in imposing
duties to secure this result to so adjust them
as to secure to our own people the production
and manufacture of such articles us we can
produce or make for ourselves without natural
aisadva"tage. and thus provi ie abuudant op
portunities for our labor. For rest assured
ihnt no economic roiicy will prove a success
unless it shall in some manner contribute to
opening up employment to the masses of our
people atiocd waÂ£Â»Â»s. .When this shall be ac
complished aud thus the purchasing powei of
the ina*s^s restored, then,-and not until the
will prices cease to feel the depre-siug in
fluencs o! under-cousumption, and the pros
perity el our ptOple rise to tne standard 6f
1892.
The past four years have been enlighten
ing, especially to candid investigators oi
economic problems. We have been attending
a kindergarten on a gigantic scale. The
tuition has come hign, but no people ever
learned >o much in so brief .a. tune. Here
efter theories, preached in however capti
vating laiiguiipe, will have to give away to the
teachings of cxi erience.
It lias been "the â  favorite assumption of
s-orae theorists that revenue and uroiection in
tbe same tariff schedule are impossible, but we
have had in tfee past seven years in the con
trasted workinj: of the -protective wool ani
wooleus^chedule of tho tariff, of 1890 and of
the similiar non-protective schedule of the
tariff oi 1894, a must striking demonstration
otherwise.
The importations of clothing wool in 1593,
under the tariff of 1890, was about 40,000.000
pounds and the manufactures of wool about
36,000,000â mainly goods worn by the well
to-do wno think It the thing to wear foreign
made cloth ai>d who ore willing to pay the
duties imposed upon it. Froiji tnese importa
tions oi wool arid woolens in 1393 the Govern
ment derived o-revenue of aboui i*44, 500,000.
Trie importations of elothine wool in the fiscal
year 1890 exceed 127,000,000 poundsâ three
times as much us In 1893â and -of manufac
tures of wool more than Uviee as many pounds
in 189G as in 1893, *ud yet the revenues de
rived by the (jover.nmeut from this enormous
increase of the imports of wool and woo'ens
in the HacaJ year 1896 was only $22,000,000â
a loss of $21,000,000 from, that realized in
1593. In other words, by the placing of wool
on tbe irec list and reducing the duties on
manufactures ot wool the treasury lost
$21,000,000 of revenue, our farmers lost a
market for the 50.000,000 pounds of wool
which they raised in 1892 in excess of what
they raised in 189S-97, as well as nearly 10
cents per pound in price, involving a loss to
them of nearly $30,000,000 per annum already
.on this one larui product, and our manufac
turers and their worlclngmen lost a mark.-t
pot oniy for tbe goods which increased lor
eign imports had supplanted, but also a mar
ket for goods which the farmers and masses of
ttie people were able to purchase in 1893, but
which tney could not buy in 1896, oecause of
a loss of employment and purchasing power.
Beyond this it has been demonstrated that by
piecing wool on the free list to the injury of
the farmers and the manufacturer, we have
not been thereby enabled to increase our ex
ports of wool (us it was reported would be tne
cast), and we bave greatly increased the use
ot t-hoddy by diminishing the purchasing
power of the masses and thus compelling them
to seek the cheapest clothes.
If it be claimed that this has reduced the
cost of clothing to the people, the reply is
obvious that it has done so only in appear
ance, beciuse In point of fact tLe masses, de
prived of work and wages by that winch has
given foreign mnnuiacturers the making of
so large a part of our goods, have found it
harder to buy their clothing than they did be
fore.
Profiting by this experience, the Ways and
Means Committee, iv framiog the pending
bill, has taken wool from the free list, where
li v.-as so UDjustlv placed by tbe present tariff,
tnd have restored it to the dutiable list at the
tame re tes as It bore in '.he tariff of 1890, and
hare also restored the same compensatory du
ties ou manufactures of wool as were provided
by that act iv order to place the manufacturer
of wool on tbe same basis as to his competitor
as was given by the latter actâ a system
always necessary'in order to provide a market
for the domestic wool. Tothis has been aided
in a partly specific form duties practically
equivalent to the ad valorem duties imposed
by the tariff of 1890 aud 1894 as a protection to
the woo; manufacturer.
This, it is believed, will greatly aid the wool
grower, stop the furtherdepletion of our flocks
and presently regain what we hare lost in the
pÂ«st four years, and ultimately result in tbe
home production of near.y all tbe clothltsg
wool tnat we rtqulre. It will aiso greatly ei:
courage the wool-manufacturiug industries
which rinve suffered so severely under the
tariff" of 1894. At the same time we will ulti
mate, v increase the revenue from duties ou
woo! and woolens not les3 than $25,000,000
per annum. '
The duty on sugar has also been increased,
Dotb for purposes of revenue and also to en
courage tbe production of sugÂ«r iv the United
States, and thus give to our farmers a new and
much neeUed crop. We now pay foreign coun
tries about $84,000,000 for imported sugar,
notwithstanding tbe abnormally low price,
and this sum will soon be increased to $100,
---000,000.
- Tbe success which has attended the growing
of sugar beets and tbe production nf beet
sugar in California and Nebraska in the past
lour year?, not to men ion the progress in the
production of cane sugar in Louisiana, has
made the problem of producing our own sugar
no longer doubtful, and now that we must
have tbe increased revenue trom sngar fat the
present, a favorable opportun.ty presents
Itself for giving this boon to our agriculture.
The duty ot s:i;ar proposed is specific ac
cordice to the polari-copic test of the degree
of saccbarine matter, commencing at 1 cent per
pound for sugar po Hrized not more 'han 73
degrees and increasing the duty .03 of a
cent for each additional degree. This
wou.d make tbe duty â¢ on raw
sugar of the sÂ«me polariÂ«copic test
as refined sugar (100 degrees) 1% cents. To
this is added one-eighth <.f 1 cent lor such
EUgar above number 16, Dutch standard, in
color (refined su?ar), making the duty 1.87JÂ£
cents. This eightu, 'with whatever lr.ay be
added by triÂ» countervailing duty on all sugar
imported from export Dounty paying coun
tries, is the protection, which it is believed
will maintain the refining industry here (not
withsta. ding the present differential one
eighth and a 40 per cent all round duty is
double that proposed). This will be the only
differential between raw and refined sugar,
for if the rtfim r U6eu sugar of less- saccharine
strength than 100, as he must, it requires pro
portionally more of such sugar to make a
pound of refined sugar. â â  -
An increase has been made in the duty on
flax and hemp, as well as jute and manufac
tures thereof, to practically tbe same as that
borne by cotton goods, both to increase tbe
revenue for the time being and ultimately to
develop the linen manufacture here. From
the evidence before the committee, we are
Versuaded that the lime rms. coma for a grad
ual development of both flax culture; and flax
manufacture in tbis country, has been
possible only to a limited extent on coarse
. artic.es under lower .duties. Specimens of
goods made from Minnesota flax are exhibited
which seem to give promise of a new develop
ment in this direction, r
For the most pnrt, otherwise, tbe Increase of
dutieÃ in the rending bill to the fieures of the
tariff of 1890 has been in the schedules or par
agraphs covering articles like tobacco, liquors,
silks, laces, elc, which, being articles oi vol
untary consumption, are always regarded us
objects which will'bear -the biche.->t duties.
Tne exceptio: s are the etrtbenware and g.a&a
schedules, the agricultural schedule, ou which
the duties have been placed the same as in the
aa of 1890, because no other rates seem to be
x protective. /
Tbe iron and steel schedule, except as to
fonie advanced products, have nut been
changed from the present law, because this
bcheaule teems to be ono of the two of the
present law which are differentiated irom
most of the others and marie in the main pro
tective. Thus, iron ore, pigiron, steÂ«l, struct
ural Iron and most other forms of common
iron ard steel remain in the pending bill as
fixed in the ttvriff o. 1894. , . .-

cesslu.iy established under the tariff of 1890
l>y tiie duty ol 2 1-5 cents, hns been - increased
from .he 1 1-5 cents duty of the present law to
ljf cents, which it is believed will prove as
protective as the hieher rate of 18:)0, as the
establishment of the industry has beea suc
cecslul.
. In ail other schedules the rates proposed in
the pending bill are between the rates of the
tariff of 1890 and tbe present law.-ggsnfe
There have been transferred from the free
list of the ttriff of 1894 to the dutiable iist of
the proposed bill not only wool, lumber, salt,
burlaps, bnps, cotton .bags mid cottou t>es,
â¢which : should never have been made non
dutiable, bin also argols, crude opium, asphal
tuni, cliickle. paintings and ; s>tatuary, straw
ornament*, etc., which, under existing condi
tions, ought to, contribute something toward
the much-needed additional revenue. .'
So far as possible, tbe%im has been to avoid
â exclusively ad valorem duties on articles
which have been notoriously undervalued
Did thus failed to pay me duties intended â a
loss of revenue which lias been more serious
than everâ the : pre-ent tariff. 4 in wliicn,
outside oi the metal and cottou schedule, al
. most exclusive ad valorem rates prevail. The
better class of importers have united with the
manufacturers and administrators of th.c law
in asking for this piece Roods in the silk
schedule, and some embroideries have for tho
first time been given exclusively specific rates,
& desideratum wnich was earnestly j recom
mended by both Secretaries -Manning and
Fairchild several years ago.
In many casts where exclusively ad valorem
duties are impracticable, because of the varied
character ot gooJs, compound duties hava
been deviled which so minimize the ad val
orem feature as to take away a large part of
the induc-'ment to undervalue. it is dif
â  riciilt to compare the rates of a tariff almosteii
| tirely ad.vaiorem with a bill whose rates are
! so largeiy specific as the pending measure, yet
| the fact that very few: duties in this bill are
rr.gher than those of the act of 1890 and
nearly, all outnde of the few schedules re
ferred to are lower and that tuo important
schedules are for the most part the same as the
duties of the present law, clearly show that
the actual average rates of the proposed bill
are lower tliun those of the tariff of 1893 and
somehixher than of tb.3 present tariffâ not
withstanding tne average percentum, aa val
orem duty under the pendiug.bill on the
present reduced price*, will appear to be
higher than the present .law Â«nd a little
higher than that of the act of 1890.
centum averages are always misleading
when estimated on a Changed basis. Thus a
duty of 50 per cent impesed upon aa imported
article valued at 60 cents abroad and 90 cents
here, mating 30 ceuts difference of cost of
production, becomes a duty of 60 percent
when the foreign and domestic cost are each
reduced 10 cents, but the duty is sail 30
cents. â¢
Again, different SDecificor compound duties
imposed by lines ot value always give a rich
opportunity for juggling with the . percent
ages. For example, If a duty of 75 cents is iu
posed on an article valued bet usl and
$â¢.! 75 on i the same kind . of article â  valued
above .$2, and so on for higher lines, then the
unsound critic, shutting his eyes to the tact
that the importer will adapt his goods so as to
fall slightly below the lines erected, proceeds
to declare that a duty of over'7o cent* has
been placed on an article valued at $1 05,
when as a mailer of lact goods anywhere uear
.*1 in value will come in under that price, and
the 75 cents duty will be on those valued at
$2; so that in point of fact the actual duty is
less than 40 per cent.
It is because o: tuese facts that it has been
found difficult to so compare rates under two
tariff- of so dvffvr nt character by equivalent
ad valorems so as io mate the comparison sat
isfactory. . â  - â  .?.; .
The average ad valorem of dutiable sched
ules under the act ot IS9O, on the basis of im
ports of 1593, wa< 4'.t l ! per cent, and with the
lower price of 1896 it would nave been at least
53 per cent. But this was with sugar on the
free list and iiquors 7 per cent less than in the
proposed bill. It sugar aud liquors had borne
the same duties as under the net 011890 and
prices haa been as low in 1893 as in 1896, the
average duty would have exceeded 60 per cent
utider the Ht-t of 1894. The average duty in
1896 was 40 per cent, but this was with sugar
at only 40 per cent, and tobacco, liquors, laces
and si ks considerably less than either in the
act of 1890 or the proposed bill.
Unauestionsbly theaverage duty under the
act ot 1894, if sugar, tob.ieco, liquors, silks
and iac -s had borne the same duty as In the
proposed bill, would have reached at least 47
per cent. The average duty under the pro
posed law, with the high duties on sugar* and
luxuries, is estimated by the experts at 55 per
cent.
The report of the Committee on Ways and
Means has set forth the tact that the pending
bill has not only restored the provisions of the
tariff of 1890 as to reciprocity, under which
our trade was so successfully enlarged, but
has extended thai policy.
Tne inquiry naturally arises as to what will
be the probable annual revenue derived from
the proposed tariff revision in case it should
become law. The only solid basis from which
we can draw inferences is that supplied by
the estimate of Mr. Evans, the statistician, who
has made the comparative statement that, on
the basis of the importations of the fiscal
year 1896, the pending bill enacte-1 into law
would yield an increase of revenue of about
$113,000,000, the details of whicn are given in
the report of the Committee of Ways aud
Means. The committee estimates, after mak
ing liberal reductions, that for the tirst year,
' in case the Mil should become a law by May 1,
the additional revenue wouid reach $75,000,
---000, and that, for every week thereafter, in
'case its passage should be deferred, there
would have to be a deduction of from one to
two million dollars lor wool, sugar and other
article* on speculation to avoid the increased
duties. For the second year It is believed I the
Drofosed bill would yield $100,000,000 of in
creased revenue.
It must be obvious from any point of view
that prompt action by the two houses of Con
gress is indispensable to s.-cure the revenue
wr.ich the pending bill- is intended 10 yield.
Trie exigency is an unusual o-:e. The people,
without regard to party athliano'is, are asking
for action. -Business awaiis our final decision.
With this great question ol adequate revenue
to carry Â»vi tiv; Government settled favorably
by sncb^BV adjustment of duties as will restore
our people what has been surrendered- to
others during tne past four years, with re
stored confidence in the future, there is every
reason, to believe that gradually and surely
there will comeback to us the creat prosperity
which we enjoyea in the decade prior to 1893,
and which the greatest of living English stati
sticians so strikingly eulogized when he said,
in 1892. tnat "it would'be impossible to fina
in history any parallel to the progress of the
United States in the (theu) lust ten years."
Some applause came from the Republi
can sitle when Dingley declared that in
the second year of the operation of the
proposed law tbe revenue of the Govern
ment would increased by at least $100,
---000,000; the Government would be put on
its feet again and the interest-bearing
debt would be reduced. Its effect for the
tirst year would depend largely upon
whether it became a law by tbe Ist of May
next.
In conclusion he quoted from an Eng
lish authority to the effect that no coun
try on the fuce of the earth had ever wit
nes!>ed such uniaralleled prosperity as
the United States in the ten years preced
ing 1892. With this quotation he took his
seat amid demonstration* of applÂ«nÂ«e. <-
Wheeier (D.) of Alabama, a member of
the Committee on Ways and Means, was
tbe lirst tooniose the bill.
Hopkins (R.) of Illinois, also a member
of the Committee on Ways and Means,
foliowed Wheeler. The Republican party,
he sai.i, was again in uower, and had been
commissioned to enact legislation that
would give confidence to capital, restore
prosperity to inaus.ries and to aericul
' ture and give employment to labor. The
bill now before tbe House is in accordance
with the almost universal demand, of the
people for tariff legislation. It was framed
on principles that were purely Republican
in character, and were designed to meet
the wants ot tne Government as well as
those of the : people. He had tupposed
until he had heard the speech of the gen
tleman from Alabama (Wheeler) tiiat no
American beiieved in free trade. He had
thought that -even Democrats would ac
knowledge the utter failure of the Wilson
bill, and would recognize the importance
j ami necessity of the proposed legislation.
But the argument of the gentleman irom
Alabtma only illustrated ti;e truth ot tne
saying that tbe genuine Bourbon Demo
crat rarely forgot any of the errors he had
learned, or learned anything new, [Ap
plause and laughter.] â¢.
A reference to the increase of American
territory ci couraged Wheeler to ci>ine
over to "Hot^cins' vicinity and ask him to
which political party that increase wa3
due. The question was countered by
Hopkins, who told Wheeler that the
Democratic party had done all that It
could to take eleven States oat of the
Union. . Applause from the Republican
side proved : bow tne reply wÂ«s approved
in that quarter, and Wheeler went back
to his seat without another word. v
Maguire (D.) of California" asKiÂ»d Mr.
Hopkins how it was that the Republican
party had b ien "turned down so unmerci
fully in 189:'." . ; ;
: "It was."-said Hopkins, "through the
false pretenJes of the Democratic leaders ;

and their ut. er inability to lead or control

DemocratM Cltim the Bill trill Only In
, crease â  the 'lax. -
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 22.â The
views of the minority of the Committee on
Ways and Means on the tariff bill were
presented to \ the House . this evening by
Representative Bailey (D.) of Texas, the
leader of the Democracy. It reads as
follows: .- â "" . â '.'-.""'â¢".:
Â»'; This bill was; framed with the avowed pur
pose of protecting the manufacturers of the
United States agalust foreign competition and
it Is perfectly obvious if it accoriipllshes that
purpose it must, result In compelling' the con
sumers of this country to pay more for their
manufactured goods, and for this reason we
think it should not pass!
We rest our opposition on the broad princi
ple that Congress was invested with the power
of tnxatio i as a means of collecting from each
citizen his fair proportion toward the support
of the government, aud that it is a gross per
version of that sovereign power to " emp oy it
as a means of cnitbllng favored classes to levy,
unjust charges upon the great body of the
people. We believe that after contribu ting his
proper share toward the maintenance of the
Government, every citizen of this Republic is
entitled to the fun possession and enjoyment
of all be can bonestly earn; and we deny tho
right of Congress to make or enforce auv regu
lation wb'ch requires one man to give any
part of his honebt earnings toward encourÂ«g
iug' the enterprise or increasing the lortuue
of another. â  : . . : t Â«: - :
No man, however blind he may.be, would
defend a system of taxnt:ou under wh:ch the
Government first collected 'he mo ey and
ufierward d.strlbuted it among its favorites.
Ii is true tbat tbe tariff act ot 1890 ventured
to this extent in dealing with the sugar
growers, but the disapproval of that policy
was so over who. miug aud so : bitter ; that tlie
advocates have been lorced to abandon it, and
they have not dared to incorpprato any pro
vision fur a direct bounty ia the present bill.'
We are unab c, however, to perceive any dif
ference in -.principle between a law which re
quires the Government to collect the money
Â«nd: distribute it among tbe protected indus
tries and a law which crinbes these industries
to collect the money directly from the people.
Tbere may be some difference in-the metuod
of making the co:iec;i and in (be cost of
doing so, but the:>' is no diftVrence whatever in
tbe principle involved. If the Government
has the right to levy'taxe* upon the peoiile
tor the purpose of inducing men to establish
unprofitable industries .or industries whicn
can only be made profitable by comp.'lli ig the
consumers of the United States to pay exorbi
tant prices for their products, then the bounty
system is a more direct and less' complex way
of attaining that end, 'and at least has lue ad
vantageof directness and simplicity. â¢-
The majority of the committee seems to
tbink that taxation can be made a blessing,
and that the support of the Government, in
stead of -being a burden upon taxpiiyets. can
be made to enrich them. If . this opinion is
well founded theu all the struggles for free
dom wblcU havo revolved around the ques
tion of taxation have .'eded upon a false
theory, and the American colonists when they
determined that they would not submit to
taxation without representation indulged a
mistaken z -al for liberty. The patriotic re
solve of our forefathers not to use goods upon
which Great Britain h.td laid an import duty
whs wroDg if the nrgument the Britisn im
porters were really paying the 'tax over which
the American colonists went to war was rigut.
; There cannot be lound in the wide - range of
economic literature an authority with tho few
and mre exceptions which only serve to em
phasize tne general . concurrence, who does
not treat taxation, direct or indirect, as a bui
den; and when we remember that a protective
tariff notonly col ects more lor.'tbe-Govern
ment than is needed for Its economical- ad
ministration, but tbat It nlso enables favored
classes to collect more than the Government
itself, the : injustice becomes - so clear â  and
so enormous - that â  it would -be*: a re
flection upon the intelligence of the American
people ;, to Â« suppose : that ;it : can escape their
swilt and decisive. condemnation. .- . "
~ It follows as a matter of course, that a bill
basest upon a; vicious principle must, .: be iu
jurious in its ; effects, and perhnps â no effect
could be . more pernicious . than tlie extruva
giir.ee which tne bill. encourages. ' The tubu
lated statement embraced -in; the committee
report shows tbat the bill is one to ruise $113,
--000,000 more revenue than was collected in
customs during tbe last fiscal year; â Â and yet,
as is shown by the same report, the differ
ences between the Governments- receipts and
disbursements during that â¢ year v was â¢ only
$25,000,000. ' It i* well known that . the . im
portations of last : year r were :' smaller .. than
uukl. owing tothe general depression that
existed in all circ.es; but even supposing that
the importations hereafter cna .be kept, at a
level with the. importations of ; 1890, the bill
will collect irom tlie people | more I than >^H),
--000.000 uniniftiiy above, tl;e requirements of
our preseut extravagant and '.wasteful- appro
priations. 4 â  . . r>>: ; '; .'
rlt may be, bewever,' that the majority
sboultl not tw *' arrAlgncd lor -â  their â  opeu en
couragement ol extravagance,' because itean
rot be surprising that KÂ»nt^meni\vho think
that taxes are not a burden .-hou'.d feelsthat
money .derived frcm luxation ouubt to be
lavisliiy spent. Nothing could better illus
trate the vice of ; the protective system i than
the fact'that there flows from it as a direct
Consequence the habit of treating the expen
diture ol puii'.ic lunds as a bcuefit rather ihnn
a burden to people. ; It would be :: cause
enough for complaint? if | tbe burden were the
only result of the extravagance/ but in a free
government extravagance breeds tendencies
of the most pernicious character. It not oniy
teaches the people to look to the Government
for the promotion of all kinds of enterprises,
wh-ther for pleasure or for profit, but it
makfg them- impatient against public ser
vants who believe in economy and who be
lieve that public moneys are a trust fund to
be jealously guarded.
An overfl iwing treasury is a constant temp
tation to enter upon expenditures that cor
rupt botii the public mind and the public a
servants. Under a system of hlgn taxes
there must be a surplus or there must be
wa-te, and both are serious eviK Pr.-sident
Jackson hardly overstated the dancer of a sur
plus when he siat -d that it was more danger
ous than a standing army ; and yet, dangerous
as a surplus Js.it is not so daneerous as the
extravagance which is always resorted to In
order to prevent its accumulation. It cannot
be forsrotten that many oi those who now ad
vocate a high tariff and defend the extrava
gance whicn it engenders did not be-itote to
denounce the admin. stration of President
Buchanan because in its last yeÂ»r the appro
priations exceeded the sum of $60,000,000.
Our population at that time was nearly naif
o; what it it to-day, and if the Government
was now properly and frugally administered
our expenses, including liberal pennons for
the soldiers of the late war, ought not to and
would not exceea the sum ol $330,000,000.
The friends ot the protective system know
that to keep the taxes high they muÂ«t find
some way of spending the money which is
collected. They perfectly understand that
they cannot resist the demand for a reduction
of taxes ii they permit their excessive collec
tions to accurnu a'e in the treasury, because
they understand that the dullest man knows
that the Goveriijnen'. is collecting too much
when It is collecting more than it is spending.
It is. therefore, the inevitable consequence ot
collecting more than is proper that liriproper
ways should be devised to spend it. The ex
travagance which necessitates the billion
dollar appropriations which have been such a
scandal upon Congress had its origin in the
unjust sys'em of levying taxes for the pur
pose ot enabling private interests to prey
upon the public through the favoritism of the
law.
If tbe system of unnecessary taxation is in
defensible because of the extravagance which
it encourages it is still more so on account of
the trusts which it fosters and promotes. It is
not more certain that protection encourages
extravagance than it is that it breeds unlaw
ful combinations of capital. Indeed, protec
tion is justified upon the avowed theory that
competition should be restricted. True
enough, it assumes the patriotic pretense that
foreign competition ought not to be permitted
against our home industries; but they little
understand the selfishness of human nature,
and especially they little understand the self
ishness of tut human nature which relies
upon the favoritism of the law to increase its
lortune. Who supposes that these men, having
secured themselves against foreign competi
tion by the favor of Congress fail to secure
themselves against domestic competition by
voluntary combinations among themselves ?
- It is an old adage.and it is as true as it Isold,
that '-competition is the life of trade," and
whatever tends to restrict competition must
tend to restrict trade. The majority of the
committee seem to thick it an easy mutter for
us to build up a tariff wall about our borders,
and thus prevent ihe foreigners from trading
with us, but they forget the same wall that
shuts the foreigner out shuts us in, and that
regulations to prevent the foreigner from
trading with us must at the same time prevent
us from trading with the foreigner.
We believe in the orinciples of competition,
and we believe the people of the United States
can successfully compete ugainst all other
people of the world; and we denounce as a
crime against the b3Â«t interests of our people
any law which leaves the consumers of this
land subject to the exactions of reckless and
corrupt com blnations formed to destroy com
petition and control the prices.
The report of the Committee on Ways and
Means is singularly silent upon the old pre
text tuat these high taxes are imposei lor the
benefit of American labor, and the silence
may be taken as conceding the Democratic
contention that the intellieence and skill of
the American factory operative are all the
protection which he need" or desires. Tne la
bor argument of the protectionist can be re
duced to an absurdity which makes it amazing
that it should ever have been seriously ad
vanced. To say in one breath that the welfare
of labor deDends upon its wages and that its
wages in turn deoend upon its skill and in
telii ence. an<i in the next breath to say hat
the very intelligent and highly skilled labor
ers of this country cannot successfully eom
iee with the iunorant and un>killed laborers
of the Old World, is equivalent to sayin.- that
still aad intelligence are not of great advan
tage to the laborers who posses< them.
To our mind it involves a contradiction In
history as well as in economic theory, to hold
that the factory laborer oi a civi.ized couutry
needs protection against the factory laborer
ot an uncivilized country. The fact that the
unskilled laborers of a half-civilized country
live more ehÂ»aplv than the skilled laborers of
a highly civilized country is more than coun
terbalanced by tne greater productiveness ot
the skilled and intelligent laborer, if this
view of the question needed further support
than the mere statement of it it ran be found
in those excellent works which assert that the
skill and intelligence oi tne American laborer
btl- such that he is able to produce seven times
as much as the less skilled and less intelligent
laborer oi Continental Europe, and fifteen
times as much as tne ignorant and unskilled
laborer of Asia.
Surely it will be admitted that a productive
capacity seven times as great as the one and
fifteen nines as great as the other should be
nil that the American laborer needs to pro
tect himself against the competition of Euro
pean druiges and Asiatic slaves. We are un
able to offer a substitute for the pending bill
because we have not been allowed a reasonable
time to prepare one. Congress convened in
extraordinary ses ion on Monday, the liJih
day of March, and his bill was introduced
the same day and referred to the Committee
on Ways and Means which met the next morn
int;, aiid on Thursday it was ordered to be re
loned to the House. The mujonty of the
committee had spent the three months of the
last session of the last Congress in the pre
paration of their bill, and yet they refused io
Hllowthe minority three weeks in which to
preDi\re a substitute. We nre unwilling to
propose a measure that has not been carefully
matured, and we must therefore content our
selves with protesting against the passage of
the eommiueo's bill.

rid correspondent of the Standard tele
graphs that Captain-General Weyler has
informed his Government that he is leav
ing Havana to resume bis operations
against the central and eastern parts of
Cuba.
A dispatch from Madrid to the Central
News says that General Primo de Rivera,
Ct ptain-General of Madrid, has been ap
pointed to succeed General Polavieja,
Captain - General of ihe Philippine
Islands, who is to be invited home. Gen
eral Polavieja is disgusted with the lack
of support furnished him by the Govern
ment in bis attempt to crush the rebellion
in the islands. The nomination of Gen
eral Rivera as his successor has created a
big impression, as he is regarded as want
ing in energy.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 22.â A dis
patch to the Sun from Havana says: It is
declared herein Spanish circles, upon the
strength of private dispatcher received
from the United States, that the adminis
tration in Washington is preparing for
co-operation with the Spanish Minister,
Senor de Lome, some solution of the
Cuban question. A mercantile firm of
Havana has received a communication
from its correspondent at New York
which gives what the correspondent, be
lieves to be "reliable news" from Wash
ington.
The news is that the plan which is be
ing considered by the American Govern
ment and the Spanish Minister is the old
scheme of ending the war in Cuba uf in
demnity to be paid by tue island to Spain
in exchange for the recognition of its in
dependence.
It is added that in the opinion of some
persons well acquainted in Washington
with the Spanish Minister Spain under
the Government of Senor Canovas is in
clined to offer more liberal home rule to
Cuba than that contained in the last de
cvee of reforms, instead of accepting the
plan of indemnity, which means the sale
of the island, and which would produce a
storm of opposition in Spain against the
Cabinet.
A great sensation has been created by a
dispatch from Madrid in which it is said
that Senor Sagasta, leader of the Spanish
Liiberal party, has declared that he is
willing to accept office if the Queen
Regent calls upon him to form a Cabinet,
and that he is confident he can extricate
Spain from the grave situation in which
she is at present involved, just as he saved
her from the tremendous difficulties 'that
environed her monarchy when the tl ath
of the late King Alfonso XII occurred.
In the opinion ot the more important
persons here iSenor tiagasta rather than
tenor Canovas is the man to accept the
plan of the -ale of Cuba to the Cubans.
The plan meets with the approval of all
thoughtful business men here, provided
the Untied States would act in an inter
mediary capacity and guarantee the fuliiil
nient of the compromise of both sides.
The insurgents are read}' to accept it.
All tbe reports from Sancti Spiritus con
tain terrible details about the con.iuct of
the Spanish troops there. The city is in a
state of terror, and as it is inland and the
Spanish columns swarm all around it,
there are no means o: escape as there are
at the seaports, where, when the barbar
ities of the troops begin, many of the
peaceful residents take refuge abroad.

There Is a Prospect of the City Soon

Well as Sea.
LONDON, Esq., March 22. âIn the
House of Commons to-day the- Right
Hon. George N. Curzon, Parliamentary
Secretary of the Foreign Office, stated
that Sir Alfred Biliotti, the British Con
sul at Canea. had reported to the Govern
ment the text of an intervisw Lad on Fri
day last by the admirals of the warships
in Cretan waters with the chiefs of the in
surgents. The chiefs did not approve of
the scheme of the powers to grant au
tonomy lo the island, and declared that
nothing but annexation to Greece would
satisfy them.
BERLIN, Germany, March 22 âThe
Post, which is known as the "Embassa
dor's organ," says semi-otticially to-day
that ii seems that an agreement between
the Dowers on the Cretan question can
not be reache.l. It adds that if Germany's
efforts to maintain peace do not meet
with the support of the other powers she
will not further lend her disinterested
services to that end.
CANEA, Crete, March 22.â Th* outlook
in this city and vicinity is not very re
assuring. The situation of the Turkish
garrison in the torts at Malaxa is very
crrica!. The pace is besieged by insur
gents and the Turkish troops have not
enough provisions to last them more thac
two days. Attempts have been made to
revictual the forts, but the insurgents have
rendered the efforts fruitless. If the
Christians capture the forts at Malaxa
and Keratide, which it now appears highly
probable they will do, Canea will virtually
be blockaded landward.
ATHENS, Greece. March 2â â King
George to-day liad a long interview with
M. Onou, ths Russian Minister, aiter
which lie summoned Prime Minister
Deiyanms, to whom he gave a prolonged
audience. The Government has ordered
the enrollment o; all robust citizens not
otherwise liable to military snrvice to
form a militia force to guard the towns in
the absence oi the troops.

Greece Evidently Anxiaua to Compromiie
H ith thr _P<itrÂ«rÂ».
: LONDON, Eng., March 22.â The Times
to-morrow will publish a long dispatch
from Athens, the gist of which is that the
Greek Government, realizing the gravity
of the situation and not sharing in the
war fever prevailing in the army and pop
ulace, is sincerely seeking a solution of the
present troubles. It awaits with anxiety
ihe effrots toward a compromise that are
being made by the powers friendly to it
and is doing everything in its power to
check the troops and prevent an outbreak
on the frontier.
The Daily News will to-morrow publish
a dispatch from Rome, the sender of
whicti claims to have received reliable in
formation that, although the powers are
anxious to maintain their concert, they
are unable to agree upon their future ac
tion. There are two courses of opinion
flowing:, one in Russia and Germany and
another in Great Britain and Italy, and
these are diametrically orposed to each
other. The dispatch adds that the Italian
Gov-rnment has instructed Admiral
Ciinevaro, who is in command of the com
bined fleets in Cretan wateri, to make an
inquiry into the bombardment by the
iurkis-h warships in the Suda Bay. and
empowering him in his dbcre.ioii to com
] c) the Turkish warships to -withdraw.
The Standard wiil to- morrow publish a
di%patch from Canea statin? that there
has been further looting by Mussulmans
of property owned by absent Christians.
The dispatch denies the alleged miscon
duct of Ottoman troops, whose behavior,
it is claimed, has been excellent.
ATHENS, Greece, March 22.â After his
audience with i tie Kin?, M. Delyannis
summoned a meeting of th? Cabinet. The
council is supposed to have discussed the
naval preparation's which Greece is making
in the Gulf of Arta, which are reported
to have, produced uneasiness in St. Peters
burg.
There is a scarcity of horses for army
purposes, and the Government has issued
a requisition for all the best horses here,
to be used by the troops. Many of ti:e
weaitby residents of the city and vicinity
have turned all their horses over to the
Government, glad of the opportunity thus
furnished them of aiding in this way the
cause of Greece.
CANEA, Ckete, March 22.â 1t ia esti
matad that nearly half of all the Mussul
man inhabitants of the island have sought
refuge here. Their number is so large
that the space within the cordon is not
sufficient for thÂ«ir needs, and in many
cases they are herded like animals.
Measures are being taken to extend the
lines with the foreign detachment on duty
Here. In the present temper of the in
surgents near the city this is considered
to be a hazardous experiment.

line, they refusing to recognize the au
thority of the admirals to establish such a
cordon.
A body of Turkish troops who were try
ing to convey provisions to the forts at
Malaxa were held in check throughout
the day by the Christian insurgents.
The troops, finding that they could not
reach the fort, signaled to the gunboats
in Suda Bay, requesting aid. The gun
boats opened lire upon the insurgents, but
could not drive them from the positions
they occupied, which effecually com
manded tne approaches to the fort. So
far as knoÂ«vn the fire from the warships
did no damage.
The insurgent leaders reiterate their re
fusal to accept autonomy from the pow
ers, and declare that if the island is not
annexed to Greece they desire war. If it
were not for the support afforded the
Turks by the powers they would in a
short time be driven from the island.
It Is believed here that success has so
intoxicated the leaders of the insurgents
that they would -not hesitate to assume
actual hostilities against the troops of the
powers. If they should join forces with
the Greek army of occupation and resist
the powers it tvould lake a strong force
and a lar^e expenditure of mouey to tun
quer them. ______________

VIOLATES THE ANTI-TRUST LAW.
United States Supreme Court Decision in
ihe Trans-Missouri Freight Asso
ciation Case.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 22.â 8y a
majority ojiinion, delivered by Justice
Peckham, the Supreme Court of the
United States to-day announced its de
cision that, the agreement in the Trantt-
Mi^souri Freight Association to maintain
rates within its territory was in viola
tion of the anti-trust law of 1890,
prohibiting contracts cr combinations in
restraint of trade, and must be aban
doned. This reverses the decision of the
courts below, which ordered the dismissal
of the Government's bill. Justices Field,
Gray, ShirÂ»s and White dissented.
justice Peckham, in the important
opinion rendered in the Supreme Court
to-day in the Trans - Missouri Freight
Association ccse, said the case presented
two questions of importance: Firstâ Does
tbe anti-trust act apply to olid cover com
mon carriers by raiiwav? Secondâ lf so,
does the acrt-enifnt complained of violate
any provision of that act?
The court finally holds: "The question
is one of law in regard to the meaning
and effect of the agreement itself, namely:
Does the agreement restrain trade or com
merce in any way so an to be a violation
of the act?
"We have no doubt that it does. The
agreement on its face recites that it is en

tection, and a violation subjects the de

faulting company to the payment of a
penalty.
"While in force, and assuming: it to be
lived up to, there can be no doubt that its
direct, immediate and necessary effect is
to pur. a restraint upon trade or commerce
as described in the act. We think the
fourth section of the act invests the Gov
ernment with full power and authority to
bring such an action as this, and if the
facts be proved an injunction should is
sue.
"The decrees of the Court of A pueals of
the Circuit Court must be reveised and
the case remanded."
The disÂ«ent of Justices Field, Gray,
Shiras and White was announced by the
latter. He said that the decision of the
court followed the letter of the law which
kilieth rather than the spirit whicb giveth
life. The ultimate analysis of that de
cision was that there must be no trade.

of the decision, said:
"It settles that the Joint Traffic Asso
ciation of t ho Eastern trunk lines is illegal
and that tha decision of the Circuit Court
of Anpeals in New York on Friday last
sustaining the lawfulness of that com
bination was erroneous.
"It will also compel the dissolution of
all similar combinations of railroads,
holding, in effect, as it does, that the
anti-Dooling clause of the interstate com
merce law is very much widened by tne
anti-trust act of 1890. It leaves the ques
tion of principle open whether manufac
turing trusts can be reduced practically
under the anti-trust law."

| iation. They wefe not present at the in
terview. The areament of the See Yups

GERMANY'S GREAT
FESTIVAL BEGINS
Berlin Alive With Prancing
Steeds and Glittering
Soldiery.
The Kaiser Unveils His Grand
father's Monument With
Much Pomp.
Many Mishaps Among the Multitude
of Spectators, but No
Fatalities.
BERLIN, Germany, March 22. â The
celebration of the centenary of Em
peror William I, who was born March 22,
1797, vrhich began tp-day was observed
througnout Germany as a national holi
day. The day opened dull and cloudy,
threatening rain, but early in tne forenoon
theskios brightened and the remainder of
the day was sunny. In the early hours of
the day Berlin presented the aspect of
Sunday. The stores were closed and the
streets were filled with people in holiday
attire. Everybody was astir by daybreak,
and by 8 o'clock crowds were hurrying to
the best points of observation of the prin
cipal sights of the day.
While the people were assembling eigh
teen regiments of the Berlin garrison,
horse and foot, were marching from dif
ferent points to the rendezvous at the
at the iJranderburg gate. The programme,
as outlined in yesterday's dispatches of
the United Associated Presses, was carried
out without alteration.
At 10 :.iO o'clock the Emperor on horse
back, wearing the uniform of a colonel of
the Guard dv Corps, with a black cuirass
on his breast glittering with insignia of
various orders, left the castle, and at the
head of the guards marched to the old
Kaiser Wilhelm Palace, whera the guards
received the keys which were deposited
there yesterday.
From the palace the guards, with the
Emperor still at their head, marched to
ihe Brandenburg gate in front of the
troops cf the garrinou, which were aliened
from the Lustgarten to the Brandenburg
gate. At this point the Kaiser with the
â¢iiiardu headed the troops and marched to
the monument, where the troops were
massed to the r.ght and left. Upon arriv
ing at the monument the Emperor saluted
the Empress, Empress Frederick, the
Prince Regent of Bavaria, the Kings oi
Saxony and Wurtem burg and the Grand
Dukes of Baden and Hesse, who were
seated under a canopy in Irout of the
monument.
Drums and bugles then sounded the
signal for. prayer, after which Chief latea
dnnt Faber delivered an oration. An
other prayer followed, when the Em
peror, in s.entorian voice, gave the troops
the command, "Present arms!" Then,
turning toward tne monument, where a
numter of marines with the unveiling
cords in their hands were waiting the sig
nal, the Kaiser shouted: "Unveil! Un
veu! 1
Down came the canvas coverings, and
the colossal monument to old Kaiser Wil
liam I was disclosed. As the covers fell a
salutv of 100 guns began, tlie bills through
out the city were rung, the binds played,
and tbe vasl crowds everywhere assembled
cheered tremendously for many minute?.
After the unveiling the Emperor ad
vanced and saluted the monument and
was followed by the Empress, Empress
Frederick, the Prince ft -gent of Bavaria,
the King ol Saxony, the Grand DuKe of
Baden, the Grand Duke of Hesse, etc.. in
the order named, nil of whom deposited
wreaths at the foot of the morument.
After tnis ceremony an evolution was per
formed by the troops. The Empresses,
tho sovereigns mid the Grand Dukas
returned to the canopy, when the review
oi the troops began, the Emperor standing
at the foot of the monument.
The spectators were sreatly oniused in
the course of the review at the spectacle of
the young Princes, the Emperor's sons,
trotting along in the rear of the foot
guards. Tbe crowds in the vicinity of tlie
monument were so great that a number of
accidents occurred and a number of
women and children fain led, but there
were no fatalities.
After the unveiling ceremonies the civic
and military paraxies and other obser
vances of the day, the sireets remained
packed with people awaiting nightfall
that they might w.tnes* the illumination
of the public and private buildings.
The illumination of the city to-night
was indescribably brilliant. The castle
was a most beautiful sight, the whole
structure being outlined with dazzling
light. Bonfires were blazing in the open
spaces and many searchlights were used
to add to the brilliant spectacle. Almost
every window was illuminated, the people
vying with each other in their attempts
to show by this means their loyalty to the
memory of old Emperor William. No
where wai there the slightest sign of dis
order.

about for an investigation. On reaching
the boat he found it contained six dead

the boat's bow, and when she was pulled
up the bodies washed out into tne sea.
Tney had apparently been held fast by

to the effect that Secretary of War. Alger
had decided not to execute the act of Con

Congress to >k further action. It was said
that Mr. Alger took the view tnat $3,000,

was needed. It is understood, further
more, that a dispatch to this effect was
printed in a San Francisco oaper " this
morning. The Call correspondent called
on the Secretary of War this afternoon at
the department.
"Mr. Secretary," he said, "a report was
wired to the San Francisco Examiner last
night stating that you would suspend,
temporarily at least, the operation of the
act of Congress appropriating money for
San Pedro haroor."
But before The Call correspondent had
completed his sentence Secretary Alger
said:
"There is no truth in the report"
'â¢Have ycu anything more to say?"
askÂ»-d the correspondent.
"No," saia Mr. Alger smiling, "except
you may say that if there was anything

Fresno's Hundred Thou

Determined to Protect Eastern
People Against Fraud in
California.
Has Demanded an- Explanation of His
Doirgs as a Colonization
Schemer.
FRESNO, Cal, March 22,â The execu
tive committee of the Hundred Thousand
Club met this evening ana decided to
make as a special order for the meeting of
the club on Thursday evening the investi
gation of the charges aginst S. N. Griffith
of swindling Eastern people in a land
selling scheme.
"Fresno has suffered enough from these
land swindlers," said a member of the
executive committee to a Call corre
spondent to-night. "Several notorious
schemes have been worked on Eastern
people, and the result has been very in
jurious to this county. If there is any
way to uo it, the Hundred-Tnousand Club
will put a stop to the swindling."
It appears that on his recent visit to
Chicago Mr. Griffith used literature issued
by the club in advertising his own project.
It is charged that he grossly misrepre
sented facts. Feeling over the alleged
swindle is running high. The real estate
agent will be invited to attend the meet
ing of the club and explain matters if ne
can. The six men whom he induced to
come to Fresno from Chicago will also be
there, and a lively time is expected.

was to-day begun in the Justices' Court
by J. E. Dooiittle, a collector, against
Mayor C. J. Craycroft, who is a candidate
for re-election as the representative from
the Second Ward on tbe Board of City

contracted in Nick Justy's saloon four
years ago, on the night of the election ol
a Republican Board of Trustees.
Mayor Craycroft and Joseph - Spinney,
tJbe two Republican trustees who were
then elected, were carried , about the
streets by jubilant citizens, and several
saloons were visited.- Nick Justy's place
was one of these, and the owner, four
years later, says the Mayor ordered
drinks for the crowd. Craycroft is not a
drinking man and was simply carried
bodily into the saloons. The ; bill is out

brought merely to hurt the Mayor in his
candidacy for re-election.

PRINT OF A SHOE
IN SOLID STONE
Strange Discovery in the
Elysian Park at Los
Angeles.
Contour of Antique Footgear of
Mexican Style Plainly
Outlined.
The Peculiar Indentation Found ia
Rock Covered by Four Feet
cf Earth.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 22.â
Scientifically inclined persons in Southern
California are tendering deeply over the
discovery, in Elysian Park here, of a dis
tinct imprint in solid stone of a shoe
worn by a human being. Tbis discovery
is certain to excite no little comment, for
there appears to be no authentic record of
a fossilized :ootprint of a human Deing of
ordinary Â«ize having been found hereto
fore. The peculiar feature of this find is
that the owner of the foot wore a shoe of
antique Mexican fashion, with high, nar
row heel and broad, flat sole. The im
print is perfectly clear, and looks as
though the owner had unwittingly put his
right foot into soft mud but a day or two
ago and left his mark, to be dried by the
sun and preserved for future generations.
The fossil imprint was discovered by
laborers who are making a deep cut for
the new wagon road northwest of the
park. It was cut out of solid rock, four
feet, or thereabouts below the surface soil
aud from a point on the hillside at least
seventy feet above tbe bottom of the little
canyon at the hill's base. The stone is a
tine-grained saale, impregnated with
lime.
An interesting fact in connection wiih
the find is this: Several other excellently
preserved and clearly delineated organic
remains, such as fern*, leaves and twig?,
have been found in the same deposit;
and, stranger still, but a few days ago the
complete outline ot a fish was taken from
the same stratum of atone not many feet
distant from this last find. The fish's re
mains were twenty feet below the surface.

SAN DIEGO'S WATER CASE.
Judge Ross Orders That the Action Be
Restored to the Calendar for
Further Hearing.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 22. â
United States Circuit Judge Ross handed
down an important decision here to-day
in the famous San Diego water case which
settles the question of the jurisdiction of
the Circuit Court in the premise?. The
case is that of Chnrles D. Lanniug, re
ceiver of the San Diego Land and Town
Company, complainant, va. H. C. Os
borne et al., and relates to exceptions
which had been filed by the complainant
in answer to an amended answer filed be
fore by the defendants.
The plaintiff was appointed by tha j
United States Circuit Court for Mas^achu- !
setts in September, 1895. The holdings of i
the company, iv addition to certain land
in San Diego County, consisted of a water
system which bad its source at the head !
of Sweetwater River, and included the '
famous Sweetwater dam. The company
supplies water to National City and to
surrounding lands. The point in dispute j
â was the rieht of complainant to raise the '
water rales. Lanning alleged that the
rate in operation had been inadequate to I
pay the expenses of his company and in- '
terest on the money invested. The com- j
pauy claimed the rurht to raise the rate i
from $3 50 to $7 an acre, basing it on the i
fact thai tvÂ« Board of Supervisors had not |
settled on any rate. The land-owners re- I
fused to p*y the new rate. Tne receiver!
then shut the water off.
The plaintiff asked that Oborne and 'â 
the other defendants be e;i joined from
prosecuting him in the State courts, and
that they be required to :>et up their
claims in the Circuit Court ; that be have
the right to increase the water rate, and
that the detendants be required to pay it.
To this tie defendants filed answer
claiming that the complainant was legally
bound to supply them with water at $3 50
an acre for all time.
Judge Ross holds that the United States
Circuit Court has jurisdiction. The Judee
orders that the case be restored to the
calendar for further hearing in respect to
the effect upon its merits of an act ot the
Legislature passed at thi3 session relating
to the estabiisament and raising of water
rates.
JUSTICE BEATTY DISSENTS.
Opinion Handed Down in the Divorce
Case of Storks Against
Storke.
LOS ANGELES, Cau. March 22.â Chief
Justice Beatty of the Supreme Court has
sent to the Los Angeles office quite an
elaborate dissenting opinion in tae di
vorce case of C. A. Storke against Ida
Addis Siorke. His dissent is from the
order deuying a rehearing, not because he
considers that the department opinion
decided incorrectly upon the propositions
submitted, but because he thinks the
piainiiff is estoDt>ea by :.is own acts to
ask a reversal of the order appealed from.
The defendant in this action was born
and brought up in this city. After gradu
ating from the high school here she be
gan writing tor the Dress and acted as cor
respondent lor a number of Eastern news
papers. Sbe was of an adventurous
nature and made several trips into
Mexico, where she wrote many interest
ing letters respecting the maiints and
customs of the peon population. During
the ;i:etime of ex-Governor Downey sue
astonished everybody here by bringing a
VB\% for breach of promise, asking dam
ages in the sum of $50,000. T. c case was
compromised out of court and finally
cism;ssed, lut it is said that the fair
' piAintifl realiz -d handsomely try her suit.
S!:e then went to banta Barbara, where
after a few weefcs' acquaintance she was
marr.ei] to Chftrta Albert StorKe, lawysr,
Democratic poiiticun and ex-member of
the California Assembly. After a few

,
Andrew Nickles Fires Two Shots at La
Rue Lemar cs the Latter Flees Down
Water Street.
SAFSALITO, Cat-, March 22â An ex
citing affray look place on the streets of
Sausalito last evening just before B o'clock.
Two shots from a revolver in the hands of I
Andrew Nickies. proprietor of an oyster i
groito on Water street were tired at La !
Rue Lemar, one of the members of the
firm of Smith A: Lemar. expressmen.
Neither shot took Â« fleet. One of the bui
lets flew uncomfortably close to the head
o! Otto Becker, a young son of C. BÂ«cker
of this place.
The shooting was the sequel to feausa
lito's famous parrott cuse. Andrew
Nickles some time ago had Lemar ar
rested, alleging that he bad stolen Nick
les' parrot. The case against Lemar was
not proved and the shooting affair of last
evening has brought the trouble forward
again.
Nickles to-day said that he was engaged
in making up his accounts on the bar in
his grotto when some person came to the
door and knocsert raiher roughly. This
was repeated and Nickles weiit to the door.
Lemar was there and, as Nickles claims,
struck him with his list, saying, "I've
been laying for you." Nickles stepped
behind fue bar and got a revolver. He
tired at Lemar and shot a second time as
Lemar was running. He claims he had a
ri/ht to defend himself.
Lemar tells another story. He said to
day that he had been drinkine and fell
against the door of Nickles' oyster grotto.
He denies having said anything to Nickles
or having struck him with his list.
Lemar swore to a warrant before Judge
J. ri. Pryor charging Nickles with assault
to commit murier. Nickles supplied
bonds in the sum of $1000 and was re
leased.

The general circulation of this news in
this vicinity made the people feel happy.
The masses realize that emancipation
from Southern Pacific tyranny is now a
fact aad their fondest hopes almost re
alized. For months the people of this
section have been anxiously speculating
on the results of plans now under way,
feeling sure that the road would be con
structed on to Visaliu. yet wondering
when the worn would begin. Now that the
element of speculation is wnolly removed,
there is a feeling of confidence in futnra
prosperity such as has seldom been felt in
this community.
For many years Visalians have patiently
carried the Southern Pacific yoke, but
they now feel the coming of freedom.

HILLHURST S MYSTERY.
Body of an Apparently Well-to- Do Man
Found in a Crore Near
the Town.
TACOMA, Wasii.. March 22.â Mystery
surrounds the finding this morning of the
body of an unknown man in the woods
near Hillhurs't, twenty miles southwest

It is that of a man 25 or 30 years old
and had evidently Jain there since Apsri.
as in the pocket was found a checK for a
valise which arrived at the Northern

The skull had become separated and
was near the feet. The man wor* cooil
clothes, ana in the valise were found lead
pencils sleeve-protectors and oiher arti
cles indicating that he had beeu a Door

The best clews to bis identity are the
initials "O. T. F." on underwear in the
valise, a ticket on a Mexican railroad,
I which had been punched at El Paso, and !
j the name, "A. Garland, Howell, Mich.,"
on the collar of the coat, indicating tnatit
bad been purchased there.
There are also four photographs, one of
three children, oue of three ladies, the
third of a man about thirty years old,
with pompadour hair and dark mustache,
and the fourth a tintype of the same three
ladies and the same man. Or. the tintype
was written opposite the women "Au
gusta, Miss Alice, Eda." On three of the
photographs the photographer's name
was erased, but underneath one can be
i traced "St. Ljuia."
In a memorandum- book found in the
vest pocket was written in ink, in a neat |
hand, the following words: "Nearer to j
na? art's heart at this my grave, April 2S,
18.9 C."
Geseman & Helny and Julius Gross <fc
Co. are the names of the St. Louis photog
raphers. The photograph of ibe children
shows two girls wearing long curls and a
two-year-old boy. The women . were evi
oebtly sisters of the suicide.

MEXICO DEMANDS
SAM THING'S LIFE
Trial of Santiago Socias'
Slayer Begun at San
Diego.
Must Answer for the Killing oi
a Subject of the Diaz
Government.
Shot in Outlaw Who Resisted Arrest
at the Hands if the Accused
M.:n'i Brother.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 22.â The trial
of the case of the People vs. Sam A.
Thing, charged with the murder of Santi
ago Socias, began tiiis morning. It givÂ«s
promise of lasting for several days. The
case presents several novel features, and
has given rise to much diplomatic corre
spondence between the United States and
Mexican State departments.
Socias was a native of Mexico. Three
or four years ago, it is said, he murdered
a man iv Orange County, escaping into
Mexico before the officers could locate
him.
In March, 1896, the Sheriff of Orange
County learned that Socias had been seen
in San Diego County, lie advised Sheriff
Jennines of this city of tais fact and
asked his co-operation in capturing the
Mexican, who was a fugitive from justice
with a price of $500 on his heart. Jen
nings then sent word and authority to
Deputy Sheriff Frank Thing at Potrero,
who had told him of the Mexican's pres
ence there, telling Thing to arrest him.
Thing knew Socias well, as the latter
had been in the vicinity for some time.
On April 10. Thing and his brother, Sam
Thing, a boy of 17 years, went over
to Tecate, a few hundred yards from the
Mexican line, and found Socias in a black
smith-shop, with his horse tied outside.
Frank Thing went insiri?, first handing
his revolver to hi 3 brother. He ordered
Socias to surrender and asked him if he
had any weapons aboui hire.
.It seems that Socias made some motion
which frightened ?am Thing, Jor as Socias
started to run out the boy drew his re
volverand shottwice, bringing Sociasdown
just as he was trying to mount his horse.
Socias died a few minutes later.
A fpreliminary examination was held
shortly afterward, the evidence tending to
show that Sam Thing feared for his broth
er's safety and lired the fatal shot. The
District Attorney, believing it to be a case
of justifiable homicide, dismissed the ac
tion.
In the meantime influential friends of
the dead man were at work, and shortly
afterward the killing was brought to the
attention of M. Romero, Mexican Minis
ter at Washington, who caused such astir
over the affair that Secretary Olney was
compelled to still farther investigate, with
the result that all diplomatic correst>ond
ence, covering several hundred pages, was
turned over to â Governor Budd, with in
structions to him to prosecute the case.

Are Seeded to Prevent the Development
of Diseases at the End of Winter.

the Worst Form of a Cold at Once.

y oil's Blood Care, the Be*t Blood Tonic
on the Blarketâ lt Enrich** and Puri
fies the Blood, Promotes Appetite and
Cives Kenewed Strength and Vitality.
Professor Munyon cays: "The idea that
one must taKe 'Spring Medicines' is a
great mistake. It is true that at tdis sea
son of the year many changes take place
in the human body that affect the blood,
liver, kidneys and nerves, but in healthy
people these cnanges occur without the
help of medicines. In fact, it is a sin
! against nature to take urujjs of any kind
I into t e%Doay unless one is iIL The so
called Spring Medicines for the blood are
also b: d because they pretena to cure all
â  disease.-' with one combination ot mcdi
i cines. If your stomach is out cf order it
I is absurd to take rheumatism medicine;
if you have a cold, a kidney remedy not
only does you no good, but may do harm ;
if your liver is giuggisb, a nerve cure is
i useless. In fact, there is only one way to
i cure promptly and permanently, that is,
by treating each phase of disease with the
I appropriate remedy. 'A separate cure for
each disease' is toe grand and true prin
ciple on which the Munyon system of
treatment has gained its marvelous suc
cess.
"If you have a March cold, the first
' thing is to cure the cold, as this is the
season when grippe and colds have a dan
gerous tendency to develop into lung dis
eases and catarrah. The most obstinate
colds yield in a few hours to Munyon's
Cold Cure. Pneumonia, catarrhal dis
eases and throat troubles are always pre
vented by this remedy. Where Colds are
complicated by a Cough, the Cold Cure
should be alternated witn Munyon's Cough
Cure.
"The debilitated condition which affects
many people in tde spring season is Na
ture's warning that some organ is weak
and often precedes serious diseases. It is
a condition which needs caretul investi
gation, and which cal.s for treatment, not
with spring medicines, but with the rem
edy that will remove the cause. If the
siomach is disordered, Munyon's Dys
pepsia Cure will act as a stomach tonic
and bowel regulator, assisting- digestion
and curing such symptoms as pain or
soreness in the stomach, indigestion or
distress after eating, fullness itt tne stom
ach, shortness of breath, poor appet-ie,
! coated toiuue, sour or bitter raising; from
the stomac:i, heartburn, wind on the
stomach, constipation, dizziness, faintnets
I and lost energy.
"If the kidneys are affected, the languid,
drai;ped-out feeling is accompanied by
I pain in the back, dart circles around the
i eyes, headaches, and deposits of red sand
â or mucus in the urine. Munyon's Kidney
i Cure is guaranteed to cure 95 per cent of
I all forms of kidney disease.
"When the liver is ai Bordered, the
: wiioie system feels the presence in the
I Dlood of the poisonous substances left by
I the defective action of this organ. In fact,
| the condition is one of general poison in -.
There is depression of the spirits, tired,
; worn-out feeling all the time. Dad taste in
i the mouth, aching and soreness in the
i rich! side, backache, and aches and pains
all over. Munyon's Liver Cure stimulates
| the liver to healthy action and makes a
] perfect cure by r moving the cause.
"Impoverished, thin and impure blood
is the foundation froni which many dis
j eases arise in the spriug mouths. The
poor quality of the biood results in a gen
eral low state of health, loss of energy and
; Ttality. The patient takes cold easily,
: and the co ds "are obstinate, leading to
catarrh, rheumatism and neuralgia. Mun
-1 yon's Biood Cuie not only purifies the
blcod, but makes new blood, rich in nour

Three Assemblymen Likely
to Be Prosecuted
in Court.
BERT PACKARD DEMANDS
AN INVESTIGATION.
Dec' ares That He Did Not Send the
Telegrams Mjde Public in the
Legislature, 3nd That He Has
B ea U.jus'.ly Accused
Matters are rapidly crystallizing in con
nection with the reports that money had
been corruptly used in tne Assembly to
secure the passage of the coyote claims
bill.
The prospects now are that two Grand
Juries will soon be taking a hand in this
melodramatic legacy ot the Legislature.
One may be engaged in investigating the
alleged corrupt connection of Bert Pack
ard with the passage of the bill. The
> other may be asked to weigh the evidence
f n T a charge of criminal conspiracy
gaiDst the sanctity of telegraphic dis
patches to be preferred against Asseuibly
men Burnett, Anderson and MelicK and
the proprietor of the Examiner.
There is no doubt, as will be seen from
the subjoined interviews with Superin
tendent Jaynes of the Western Union
Telegraph Company aud ex-Judge R. B.
Carpenter, the attorney of the company,
that criminal proceedings are to be insti
tuted against the tbret> Assemblymen
who composed the sub-committee which
seized the box of telegrams at the Sacra
mento railroad depot. While it is known
that the Examiner placed money and
other means at the disposal of the com
mittee to enable it to carry out its alleged
unlawful seizure of dispatches, there is
some question as to whether it can be con
nected legally with thÂ« tinal consumma
tion of tne act. If this can be established '
the proprietor of that journal wili also be
proceeded against.
Bert Packard has tamed up at Sacra
mento and in an interview with a Call
correspondent, given in another coiumn,
asserts his. innocence and declares he is
anxious for an investigation.
In tbe capital city tiie general opinion is
that no monÂ«y was paid for votes to pass
the coyole bill, and if any was paid to
Packard he retained it all for his own en
r.ctiment.
In ibe dying hours of the Assembly a
resolution was passed requesting Attorney-
General Fkzgerald to defend the members
of the coyote bribery committee in any
action that might be brought against
them. If a civil action were to be insti
tuted he could, and undoubtedly would,
appear in their behalf, bui he is debarred
by reason of being the State's chief legal
prosecutor, from defending any person in
a criminal action. If any State official
were charged with a criminal offense his
duty would call him to the side of the j
prosecution. For these reasons it can be I
st.i ed as a fact that he will not defend the
three committemen should an indictment
be found against them.
Superintendent Jaynes of the Western
Unioa Telegraph Company was somewhat
averse to discussing the matter of the
teized telegrams yesterday, deciarinz that
it was in the hands of the company's at
torney, ex-Judje R. B. Carpenter. But
he felt too Keenly the manner in which
tne company had been treated not to take
advantage of the opportunity to explain
its position.
"They used force," he said, "to compel
the agent of Wells, Fargo & Co. to give up
the box of dispatches. No subpena had
been issued for it and there was no possi
hJe. excuse for the violence they used.
The committee showed an utter disregard
of good faith. They had promised not to
resoitto this method, as we had agreed to
produce the telegram for which they had
issued tbe subpena. Chairman Mcl ck
cad that was all that was required and
declared the committee wouid take no
further action in the matter bo iong as
the box was being brought back to Sacra
mento.
'Under tbe circumstances there is noth
ing for the company to do but to pursue
this matter as far as it can so as to protect
its business. As none of these three men
can be reached in a civil suit for damages
owing to their financial standing the mat
ter will have to bo referred to the Grand
Jury in order to meet the issue and make
a proper tesi. â 
"Some criticism has been made on the
company's action in sending the messages
out of ti;e State. They were sem away
before any processxhad been issued, and
even if they had been placed beyond the
jurisdiction of the committee I should not
nave reiused to give up any message that
had been properly and legally ordered to
be produced. That the company has acted
in perfect good faith is shown by the lact
tnat.the message sent to Constable Ljng
at Truckee was promptly delivered. It
conld have been held at tbe office in
Truckee. We were not called upon, to
eend out and find the constable.
"To prevent any similar occurrences in
the future all Sacramento business, dur
ing the session of the Legislature, will be
mailed out of the State at the end of each
i day. We will never take any chances of
I such high-banded outrages in the future.
' "Burnett got up in the Assembly and
,-tate<i that I broke in the door. That is
entirely untrue. Some one inside opened
the lioor to admit somebody and I crowde l
in after him. In the contusion resulting
from mv appearance a sinail table was j
overturned and iJurnett, in his excite
ment, ordered the sergeant-at-arms to ar
rest me. 1 entered simply to be able to
identiiy the men, and said I was ready to
go. Burnett then ordered me sent to jail.
The sergeant-at-arms replied he had no
authority t(J send any one to jail.
â¢ "'I do not thintc trie members who voted
for the reading of those telegrams were at
all to blame. They had the messages be
fore them and it was not their business to ,
inquire as to how thÂ»-y came there. If I|
were a member I think I should have
voted for their reading."
Judge Carpenter, while declining to
state specifically what course he proposed
to pursue on behalf of his clients, spoke
freely concerning the exciting episode at
Sacramento in its legal phuse.
â  "So far as the facts are concerned," he
said, "The Call is in possession of most
of them. Three members of the commit
tee outoft'e nine issued a subpena on
Mr. Senf, the Sacramento manager of the
Western Unon Telegraph Company, to
produce a'teleKram B?nt from the Sacra
incrno office to Bakersfield, directed to
BloUgei and sgned "Bert." Mr. Sanf is
an old gentleman, over 80 years of age,
â very infirm in every way, and he. in
obedience to the subpena, appeared and
then askert them to be allowed to consult
counsel. The Examiner was represented
by Mr. Climie, and Mr. Clunie insisted
1 that he had no right to counsel, and th-.s
1 fraction ol the committee so decided.
â¢â¢Trie disf-tcbes had been sent away by
1 Mr Senf, and he told tuis committee that
he had sent them away and where he had
tent them. Tne committee telegraphed
to a Constable at Truokee to get them,
and at that stage of the proceedings I ar
rived in Sacramento and had an inter
view with the committee. I spoke witn
its chairman, Mr. Melick, and he told me
that alt they wanted was the dispatch
they had asiced for, and I agreed with
him that Mr. Senf would produce that
dispatch.
"It was known that the dispatches were
on their way back, and it was arranged
that at 8 o'clock in tbe morning the man
ager of the telegraph company and myself
would be at the committee- room; we
would unfasten the box, take out the dis
patch they wanted and give it to them.
They .said this was entirely satisfactory.
"Instead of doing as they agreed they
went down to the depot between 6 and 7
o'clock in the mornim;, took the dis
patches by force from Wells, Fargo & Co.,
carried them to room 72 in the Capitol
and rifled and examined all thedispatches
that had been sent from Sacramento
from the 4th day of March down to the
18th.
"This was done with locked doors. No
body was permitted to co in or have any
acc?ss to them whatever.
"It was reported, and Mr. Burnett
stated it in a speech, that Mr. Jaynes
broke open the door. He did nothing of
the kind. The door was opened tor some
body to co in and he followed. There was
no breaking of locks or doors or anything
else,
"We regard the whole performance a*
an outrage, indefensible from any point of
view,
"In the first place, no demand had been
made for any other than th* one dispatch,
and that we were ready to give them.
"In the next place there had been no
authority conferred upon the committee
to take any such couise, and if the Legis
lature had attempted to confer sucn
power it would have been illegal. These
dispatches were our property. The com
mittee had no right to them whatever. It
laid no foundation for securing any of
them, except the one of March 11.
"It goes without saying that it is illegal
and a public offense for any telegraph
company's acent, mana.er, operator or
any other person to take the dispatches
that belong to the company that have
been sent by its patrons and examine
them and make them public.
"Our rights have been invaded ruth
lessly by this part of the committee. What
course will be pursued in the future I do
not now care to discuss. The Western
Union Telegraph Company has a large
property. Its entire value consists of its
good faith and the secrecy of its dispatches.
If every demagogue, because he happens
to be in the Legislature and on a commit
tee, can violate the banctity of tho<e dis
patches and destroy our property ruth
lessly, we may as well know it and go into
some other business."
How the Examiner figured in the case
and how the matter was viewed by the
committee is shown in this statement
made by Chairman Melick at Sacramento
on Saturday:
"After the adjournment of the Legisla
tnre last night there was a tender ot a
special train by the Examiner people to
take us to Truckee, and get the box which
contained all the dispatches sent from
Sacramento from the sth of March up to
the present time. I considered that the
Examiner was doing this !or a sensation
rather than for the good of the State, and
1 felt thai it was not ri lit for us as officers
of the State to accept the tender of a train
in that way.
"After we had declined the offer the
committee a. am held a session until about
2 a. m., and we d rided that three of us
should go up to Rock. in. Afterward we
found that we could not get through in
time, and we decided to meet at the depot
.is the train came in at 5:50 a. m. Messrs.
Burnett, Anderson and myself were at the
depot us the train came in and met Con
stable C. \Y. Long of Truckee, who told
us that he had got off at each station be
tween here and Truckee, and he was posi
tive that the box which he had taken into
his possession was o:i the train in the
express-car.
"We did not see any box put off, and
just as the train was about to pull out we
rushed into the car and served a blanket
subpena through the sergeant-at-arms of
the Assembly, who accompanied us, and
we demanded to know where that box
was, ana we sad that the train would be
held until he toid us.
"The conductor neid the train, and the
ineÂ«eriger said that the box had already
gone into Wells, Fan;o & Co.'s express of
fice at the depot. We went into the de
pot and found that the agent had un
locked a large box, and inside of that was
a box weighing about thirty pounds. We
demanded it nnder the subpena, and after
signing a receipt for it we entered a hack
and returned to t c committee-room 72 in
the Capitol at about 6:30 a. m.
"There Anderson, Burnett, John Wray,
our cleik, and myself lociced the door and
went into executive session and examined
all the dispatcnes in the box from March 5
to the present date. We separated out of
the whole batch fourteen that had a direct
bearing on this case. We tied up the oth
ers hs they were before and sea ed them in
the box, and delivered them to Jaynes in
person.
"From the telegrams and the fact that
Bert Packard was continually on the floor
lobbying on behalf of the coyote s -alp biil,
I woul<l infer that money was used, but I
frankly confess tat there was no absolute
proof belore the corurritiee that Packard
was not bleeding Banker Blodget for his
own gain."
Later Mr. Melick added the following
statement: "In two respects I think the
Western Union Telegraph Com pan y made
grave mistakes to put it mildly. First, in
undertaking to defeat the ends of legisla
tion by thus hurrie !ly -enJini; desired
telegrams from the State, and second, by
its superintendent breaking into a room
where a le -lslative committee was at
work. I had no personal ends in view in
this investigation. I did not desire to
take it up, and twice vigorously objected
on the floor of the Houae to undertaking
it, but as it was forced upon my com
mittee I made up my mind to leave no
stone unturned in doing the work directed,
regardless of whom it might hit, or
whether a poor person or a great corpora
tion is directed to do anything "
Attorney-General Fitzgerald't impres
sion of the action of the committee is in
dicated in the following few but signifi
cant sentence*:
"The committee sent down to me to ask
my opinion as to whether they had the
right to open the box of dispatches. I
found that they had already opened it,
aud refused to give them any opinion. No
committee has tbe right to require me to
give an opinion, but the Legislature may
request me to do so, and then I must give
it in writing."
Opinions of Legislators.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 23.â The
general consensus of public opinion as ex
pressed by such of the public officials at
could be prevailed upon to talk upon the
subject, by the attaches of the late Legis.
lature and by sundry shrewd members of
the Third House who linger around the
battlefield, is that not one atom of money
was used to procure the passage of tbe
coyote claim bill, and that the sudden
switch of fifteen votes made on reconsid
eration was the result of one of those legit
imate combinations which were so much
in evidence during il.e entire session.
"There bat never been a session in the
history of tbe Stite," said one of those
shrewd manipulators of legislative meas
ures, "in which v here hat been so much of
this oid talk 'You vote for my bill and I'll
vote for yours,' and sucb a dead square
carrying out of such proposition.-, as has
been done at this session; and it is my
opinion that Bert Packarn had a very
small portion in having the vote changed
in the coyote scalp claims bill, not but
what lie would have been perfectly willing
to have assumed that honor could he have
done so. And who would blame him?
"Now, although I do not want to be
personally quoted in this matter, as I was
in no way connected with those interested
in the passage of this bill, still there were
other bills that I was interested in, and in
my connection with these 1 often came
indirectly in contact with the coyote bill,
and, in ray opinion, the change of votes
was procured by a combination which re
sulted in the appointment of Harry I.
Mulcrevy as Registrar of Voters in "San
Francisco, and was mainly due to the
efforts of that ambitious young Assem
blyman from Kern, E. J. Emmons, who,
Knowing that a large portion of these
claims were held by the people of his
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 23, 1897.
county, thought it no more than a duty
â due his constituents to try and have the
bill parsed, and succeeded by agreeing to
assist Mulcrevy.
"That not one cent of money was used
to procure this result I am fully convinced
in my own mind, and that Packard used
any is also a mistake. The idea that
Power received any is farcical, because we
were very friendly", and I never knew him
to be in funds only after drawing Ins
money on bis warrant. How I know
these things I do not care to state, but
you can just bet your pile that what I am
telling you is dead straight."
Bert Packard, who was very much in
evidence bere tt>-day, said to a Call repre
sentative:
"I am not very ambitious to be inter
viewed on this subject, not because I have
used any underhand means to procure the
passage of the coyote claim bill, but be
cause I consider the charges farcical in
tbe extreme, and a foolish method on the
part of the Examiner to kick up a sensa
tion and to get square on the Hale &
Norcross fake.
"You can say for me that I have never
made any attempt to keep shady or to es
cape public view. I never sent one of tbe
telegrams which are attributed to me and
which have created such an uncalled for
sensation; in fact, 1 cannot see in what
way they have been as yet connfCted with
the passage of the coyote claims bill ex
cept by inference. I wish also to say that
I have never under any circumstances
paid one cent of money to any member of

before this thing is finishel there may be
parties who will regret attempting to sad
dle upon my shoulders matters of which
I am innocent. I reiterate that I never
sent one of those telegrams to Blodset,
nor have I paid or promised to pay one
cent to any member for his vote on any
claim. I don't care whether lam quoted
or not, as I have been unjustly jumped by
the press in this coyote matter ever since
its introduction during this session. I
have an idea that it will be hard to prove
a man guilty ol what be is perfectly inno
cent of."
Governor Budd has left the city for a
short vacation, and could not be inter
viewed on the subject.
In speaking of the subject Controller
Colcan said : " As far as the merits of the
coyote claim bill are concerned I per
sonally beiieve that the bill is all right. I
say tni* because there can be no manner
of doubt but what there are plenty of
legitimate claims against the State which
should be paid, and as the State Board of
Examiners are empowered under the pro
visions of the act to investigate as to the
validity of every claim presented, and are
also fully empowered to reject such as in
their opinion are fraudulent, I can see but
little chance for false claims. I think the
bill should become a law. I think that it
possesses so roach merit that tiiere was
not the slightest need to use money to
lobby its passage, nor do I think for one
moment that any money was used, but
this is only my individual opinion."

ONE DAY WITH
BOOTH-TUCKER
He Explains His Coloniza
tion Scheme to Busi
ness Men.
This Will Be Presented Later
to Capitalists for Ap
proval.
Y.-sterday Morning the Commander
Urged the Cooperation of
tte Ministers.
Commander Booth-Tucker of the Salva
tion Army presented a clear exposition of
his colonization scheme to a representa
tive audience of San Francisco business
men at the Chamber of Commerce yester
day afternoon and twenty minutes later
the following resolution, proposed by
George F. Butler, was unanimously
adopted:
Jiexo'.vcd, That a committee ot fifteen be ap
pointed by the chairman to present piaus in
detail to the capitalists ami businessmen of
!-an Iraneisco with tne purpose of nraciically
illustrating in our State the possibility and
advantage to the commonwealth of tho estab
iishment of the unemployed on small farms
near our centers of population and on vacant
lots in this vicinity.
Among other prominent Salvationists
at yesterday's meeting, in addition to the
commander, were Lieutenant - Colonel
Keppel, Major Mclntyre, the general cec
retary, Major Milsaps of the War Cry,
Mnjor Winchells and Adjutant George S.
Montgomery.
The ci; airman, Hugh Craig, introduced
the commander, and in doing so spoke
briefly on the questions at issue. He re
ferred to the existing situation in San
Francisco and the melancholy fact that
'leititution makes men willing to .work for
$1 a day, and eight or ten hours a day. He
insisted that the solution of the problem
must be found in some plan whereby the
surplus population can be placed upon lhe
land.
Commander Booth-Tucker dealt with
phases of the sociological problem before
speaking of the army's plan of coloniza
tion. He undertook to correct certain
mistaken impressions as to the scope or
its proposals to ameliorate poverty, de
claring that it was ridiculous to suppose,
as some people apparently believed, that
t"he expenditure of $500 000 would wipe
out destitution altogether.
The commander pave some interesting
statistic* to show the extent of the'army's
social work, calling special attention to
the city colonies in this country and their
remarkable development during the last
few months. The institutions in San
Francisco included a prison-gate farm, a
labor bureau, a clinic, a poor man's law
yer and a children's home The Pingree
plan for the cultivation of vacant lots was
referred to 83 an excellent expedient for
temporary relief and one calculated to
give the cultivator a rough and ready
Knowledge of agriculture, which would
the better qualify him to join one of the
army colonies.
The commander explained the latter in
the following terms: "These farm colonies
are to consist of from 100 to 1000 acres of
land In as close proximity to the City as
possible, divided into five-acre lots or
thereabouts, on which to settle the people
as peasant proprietors. Connect d with
these we propose to have large settlements
of 100,000 acres and upward; in other
words we want to restore the forcotten art
of homiculture. We have agriculture and
horticulture, but horniculture has been
forgotten.
"If the 3,000,000 surplus population of
our cities were transferred to the land
what would happen? Taxes would be re*.
lievrd and these people instead of becom
ing tax consumers would become tax pro
ducers. More than that, the value of
land would be increase-! right away, and
land now worth $3 or $4 per acre would
then be worth from $100 to $1000. This
was wliat happened in Enelan-d. We pur
chased some time ago 1000 acres of land
near the mouth of the Thames at the rate
of $100 an acre. It is now selling at from
$500 to $1000 an acre. The root of the
present difficulty is thai while the cities
are suffering irom over-population the
agriculturists are suffering from the very
opposite evil. The centripetal forces of
the ci-ty have been such as to attract the
population, and our charitable institu
tions have encouraged 'this ten Ifency in
stead of setting centrifugal influences in
operation for the distribution of surplus
labor over the country.
"This sc . erne can be made a thoroughly
business propositionâ able to pay its way
and give a reasonable interest as well.
Suppose we have 1000 acres of land which
we are going to colonize with 200 families
in five-acre blocks. Our idea would be to
send out twenty single men to prepare the
lirst twenty lots, after which twenty fam
ilies would walk right in and take posses
sion. They in their turn would prepare
the way for the next fifty families and
those seventy families for the next hun
dred, and so on. Out of the money earned
from the sale of milt, butter, etc, and oc
casional work on the ranches in the neigh
borhood they would soon be in a position
to pay for the land.
"Presuming a five-acre blocK to cost $500
the owner would be asked to pay a dollar
a week, or 5 per cent for interest and 5 per
cent, for repayments.
"I look upon the vacant lot proposal as
of great educational value, but we also
propose to have a series of lectures for
workmen by means of which they will be
< taught the rudiments of agriculture. We
desire to make them familiar not only
with p<uit culture, as the French term it,
out also to qualify them to become
genuine farmers.
'I would sucgest that a committee be
formed and $25,000 invested, which at 5
per cent wou.d bring $1250, and 250 persons
could be settled. If placed in a suitab.e
atmosphere its success would be assured,
especially with the moral safeguards
which I think we would be able to
supply "
In the subsequent discussion Dr. Stal
lard, H. H. Sherwood and George F.
Butler took part, and the latter' s res
olution was finally adopted. The com
mittee will be appointed in the coarse
of the next few days. A vote of thanks to
the commander brought the meeting to a
close.

its work. The ministers of other evaneeM

present and most of the members of the
Baptist, Methodist, Congregational and
Christian ministerial societies were pres
ent. ''l'j "â 'â .'. -\ 'â¢
; "Sympathy f-. with the army work was
what the commander had come to ask
and he touched mainly on what the army
has achieved and hopes to achieve among
the V natives *' of -v India V amd f_ among \ the
masses who dwell in the slums of Chris
tian cities. Members of the army had
been severely criticized by missionaries in
India for living like the natives, but the
commander declared that by doing so the
natives could best be reached. ' : ; --
â  "With the natives the question of Chris
tianity is largely a question ot bread and
butter or of curry and rice; Three-fourths
of the inhabitants of the villages never
saw such .' a thing 'as ' money; â â â¢ they are
given a share of the crops. The moment
a man steps across the line of heathen
dom his food supply is cut off by the Hin
doos. lam certain India cannot be really
Christianized till the . missionaries face
this question."
* The commander said that General
Booth's desire was to obtain a large tract
of land from the Government for Chris
tiamized natives. He earnestly commend
ed Iho scheme to â  the various mission
boards, declaring that the Government
looked favorably upon the plan. , ..:
' ' In regard to the social plan Commander
Booth-TucJcer declared that to take the
surmus population from the cities to ibe
land would open up a great vista of pros
perity for California. "Another point of
view,'" he said, "is that of safety. If our
brethren here had to face some of our
people in the slums their dangerous char
acter would impress itself upon them."
A detailed account of tae array system
was given, the commander answering ob
jections which might be made to. the strict
rystem of discipline. He concluded by
commending the work to the sympathy of
Christian churcher.
A number of pastors asked questions
relative to the statement that t.ne Salva
vation Army gives converts to the
churches. Some of the questioners seemeJ
to regard the army as an active rival to
the churches, but Commander Booth-
Tucker declared that the Salvation Army
gives more members to the churches in
the way of converts than it takes from
churches in the way of army workers. â  !
JULIAN SAYS "NIT!"
Champion 6 b Did Not Punch
an Englishman in tha
Stomach.
Fitz Will Join the Thespians, and a
Hay Is Now Being Writ
ten for Him.
Rolert Fitzsimmons, who now signs
himself the "retired middle and heavy
weight champion pugilist of the world,"
left this City yesterday for Sacramento
for the purpose of giving an exhibition in
the capital city last evening. He will re
turn to-day, it is thought, and his man
ager, Julian, is now arranging a tour
for him through the country.
Julian, the manager and director-gen
eral for the champion, was not in a pleas
ant mood last evening, and when asked
questions regarding the future move
ments of Fitzsimmons he replied in an
evasive way. In fact be would not say
anything because he did not apparently
know anything.
When asked about that little disturb
ance which was reported to have taken
plac^ Sunday morning in the grillroom of
the Baldwin Hotel between Fitzsimnions
and an Englishman who had taken Cor
belt's part, the "only" Julian replied that
the report as published in the evening
papers was without any foundation of
fact.
Julian said be had not spoken to Cor
bett nor his manager Brady since his ar
rival in this City and that so far as he was
concerned he had no business to transact
with either man.
"What in the name of all that is good,"
said Julian, "does Corbett want witu me
now. 1 navo been trying for the past six
years to get Corbett and Fitzsimmons to
gether, and the now ex-champion, as I
understand, is looking for a return match.
Everybody knows that Corbett refused to
meet J'eter Jackson a second lime and
here he is now, alter getting a good lick
ing, expecting an immediate return con
test with the champion of the world.
"Well, I puess he will have to wait until
we are good and ready, ana that will be
many years, as Fhzsiiumons has an
nounced his retirement from the ring,
having won all the honors and emolu
ments that are attached to a champion
ship contest Let Corbett try his hand
wilh Peter Maher, Choynsici and others
who are lookine for distinction and the
best man can claim the championship, as
Fitzsimmons has no further use for it.''
Julian said Fitzsimmons will tour
through the country, and that a play is
now being written for him, but the title
will not be made known until after it is
copyrighted.
Fitzsimmons has been ordered to appear
in the Justice Court to-day at 1 o'clocic to
answer to an order of examination taken
out by J. J. Raver.
The claim on which the order is based
is that of Jimmy Carroll, the lightweight.
who sued Fitzsimmons for services and
got a judgment for $967 and costs.
When Fitzsimmons was here oefore, at
the time of the Sharkey fight, an attempt
was made to collect the money, but he w%s
not so opulent at that time as at the pres
ent, and the attempt failed.
FITZSIMMONS' CASH.
Sheriff Whelan Finds Nothing to
Attach and the Pugilist
Must Explain.
Robert Fitzsimmons will soon be in
co art again, as Attorney George H. Peny
has applied for an order of examination
to compel the conqueror of Corbett to tell
what has become of that $15,000 purse
which he is reputed to have received from
Dan Stuart.
Some time ago Carroll, the boxer, sued
Fitzsimmons for $904 44 and trot judg
ment, but wftsunabie to collect the money
because the tisrnterwas un9ble to respond.
In his affidavit Mr. Perry swears that
thÂ» Sneriff and his deputies* have made a
faithful searcli. and "that, according to
thÂ«Â« return of ihe writ, no property of the
defendant has been found on which to
levy sairf execution ; that as deponent is
informed and verily believes said defend
ant has properly in his possession or
under his control sufficient to satisfy said
judgment and execution winch he con
ceals or has concealed."
When the author of the knockout blow
returned to Carson another effort was
made to collect the debt, but Fitzsimmons
declined to pay, as hereinbefore intimated.
Now he will be hauled up in court to tell
whether he reahy received $15,000 from
Stuart, and to show cause generally why
he does not pay the bill.

THE MAYOR'S APPEAL.
We publish this morning ah open letter from Mayor Fbelan to the citizens of San
Francisco urging them to subscribe promptly and liberally to the fund for the con
struction of the new boulevard. The appeal is terse and directly to the point. It should
be read by every citizen, and all who can afford to do ao should respond to it with a
true civic patriotism.
It is not necessary to go over again the advantages of the proposed work. All
citizens who take an intelligent interest in municipal affairs are well aware why the
work was undertaken and why it should be vigorously pushed forward. It is to pro
vide work and waees for industrious men who have long suffered fiom enforced idle
ness and who, with their families, have in many edges undergone actual destitution.
It is to provide the City with a much-needed highway at a comparatively small cost.
It is therefore an issue of sentiment and of business, and on each score well deserves
the support of men of generosity and public spirit.
The contributions to the work are already of a magnitude highly creditable to the
City. The Spring Valley Water Company and ex-Mayor Sutro have generously given
the right ol way. Mayor Phelan has given emphasis to his appeal by donating $1000
to the fund for constructing the work. Other citizens in proportion to their means
have been hardly less generous. The number of contributors has been great. The
enterprise therefore is fairly started. Lot us continue in well doing.
The number of men to whom work has been so far given is but a fraction of the
whole number who need it The amount of monÂ«y subscribed is insufficient to com
plete the work. What has been accomplished will bs largely a labor in vain unless
more money is forthcoming and the fund raised is made equal to the full require
ments of the enterprise. React the Mayor's appeal! Respond to ir. Let us construct
a boulevard which will be a monument to the public spirit of our citizens and a just
object of civic pride not only by its beauty, but by the manner in which it was under
taken and completed.
DEMOOEATIO POLIOS".
According to a statement recently made
to a correspondent of the New York Herald
by Senator Mills of Texas, the Republi
cans will experience no difficulty in se
curing the passage of the tariff bill either
in t c House or in the Senate. "It is the
intention," said Mr. Mills, "of the Demo
cratic Senators to point out the evils of the
measure and some long speeches on that
line may be expected, but you may de
pend uDon it the Democrats will not
throw any obstacle in the way of the final
passage of the bill."
The statement of Senator Mills is in ac
cord with statements on the same subject
made by Senator Jones of Arkansas, Sen
ator Morgan and other influential Demo
cratic leaders. It may be regarded, there
fore, as '.he settled policy ot the Demo
crats in the Senate to content themselves
with speaking and voting against the
hill, without making any attempts to de
lay its prompt adoption.
If this policy is carried out the treas
ury will derive great benefit. Importers
have already begun to bring large quanti
ties of goods into the country go as to
avcii the higher duties which the new
tariff will impose. So large are these
importations that the customs receipts at
New York are now abnormally high.
The New York Herald reports that on
March 15 the customs duties paid in that
city were the largest for any single day on
record. The high-water mark had been
for customs duties August 1 1872. when
the total receipts were s2.3oÃ, ooo tiut those
of March 15 amounted to $2,667,971), or
nearly $3C0,0K) above the highest record
hitherto made.
In his speech on reporting the bill to
the House Mr. Dindey estimated that if
the tariff could be enforced by May 1, in
stead of being delayed to July 1, the
country would save over $15,000,000 in
revenues. This statement is hardly an
exaggeration. From this time on until
the new bill goes into force foreign goods
will be rushed into the country as rapiily
as possible, and it is therefore in the
highest degree expedient that the new
tariff should be ptM into effect at a date
not Jater than the time fixed by the Ways
ana Means Commitiee.
There will be some change made in the
bill as reported. Tbat much seems evi
dent from all reports that have come to
us. California may gain by these changes
to the extent at leasi of having a higher
duty placed upon Zsnte currants and
possibly in iodih other scbedules. Amole
time will be given for consideration of all
amendments of this nature. It is not tbe
intention of the framers of the bill, nor of
the Republican majority, to rash it
through without allowing full and proper
consideration of every feature.' All these
legitimate amendments can be made,
however, without prolonged debate, and
tne countâ¢ will give tha Democratic
party credit if those who represent it in
Congress will follow the wise policy oat
lined by Senator Mills and others and ab
stain from throwing any obstacle in
the way of the final passage at an early
date.
PELAGIC SEALING.
If Dr. Jordan is right in his estimate of
the views of the administration on the
subject of the protection of seals in Bering
Sea, It is probable we shall soon see the end
of that blundering and ineffective policy
which oas been too long pursued. Dr.
Jordan reporU that he had a talk with
President McKiniey, and says, "Before I
finished an explanation of the sad condi
tion of affairs in Berine Sea. I thought I
saw blood in McKinley's eye."
It will be remembered that nnder the
Cleveland administration the task of pro
tecting the American seal fisheries was
regarded as so hopeless that it was seri
ously proposed by the Government to ex
terminate all the seals on the islands.
Tbat would have been like curing a dis
ease by killing the man who had it, and
the very fact tbat it wa? even considered
shows how futile was toe foreign policy of
the Cleveland administration not only in
action but in counsel.
Dr. Jordan believes it ia probable that
Great Britain will not refuse to unite with
us in taking steps to preserve the fur seal".
This belief is based upon the fact tbat the
conclusions of the British commission
agree in all matters of fact with the nmi
in^s of the American commission, and
therefore both Governments have a ba?is
of agreement on wnich to rest a harmoni
cas course of action.
If Great Britain does not consent to the
terms proposed by the United States it
will be poisible for our Government to
undertake the protection on its own re
sponsibility. It is proposed to brand the
female seals on the islands in such a way
as to destroy the value of their skins, and
also to protect tne males by herding tnem
in the salt lagoon on St. Paul Island dur
ing the sealing season. According to Dr.
Jordan, experiments made last summer
have demonstrated the feasibility of these
two measures, and if carried out their
effect will be to put an end to pelagic seal
ing by rendering it unprofitable.
It is certainly time the United States
Government should take some deter
mined action in the matter. While years
have been wasted in fruitless negotiations
with Great Britain, the practice of pelagic
sealing has been carried on to such an ex
tent that the great herd of seals in Bering
Sea has been well nigh exterminated. It
is gratifying to learn from Dr. Jordan that
the present administration will put a
speedy end to this condition of affairs.
Pelagic sealing will be stopped and the.
fur seal herd will be preserved.
It seems we may look to McKinley for
protection to our seal fisheries as well as
to our other industries. He means busi
ness in every direction.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. MARCH 23, 1897.
DIPLOMACY AND MONEY.
It is significant of the conditions under
which we live that while at this time the
warships of the nations are gathering in
Grecian waters and men are being armed
along the Turkish border; while diplo
matists and statesmen are fretting their
weary brains by day and by night, the in
telligent portion of the world pays less
attention to what is being done eithsr
by the warriors or the diplomatists than
to what is going on in the stock exchanges.
People are looking not to Crete but to the
London money market to see whether
there will be peace or war, and as lonir as
the market is quiet they are not disturbed
by anything which happens among the
warships or the soldiers.
During the whole perioi since the pres
ent crisis began the money marktt has
b?en quiet, the sale of stocks and bonds
has gone on undisturbed, and there hns
been no evidence of excitement on the
side either of the bulls or the bears. This
/act is regarded as conclusive evidence
that there is no immrdiate danger of war
and that however affairs may go in th.>
Levant some means will be found of
maintaining peaca and keeping unim
paired the value ol the bonds of the na
tions involved.
To this extent the money power rules
the world. Warriors may be ready to
fight, diplomatists may have arranged
alliances which will justify their nations
taking action to settle the Turkish ques
tion, but until the money-lenders and tne
holders of Turtcish bonds see a war to save
the capital they have invested in Turkish
securities it is not at all likely that any
Government will take the initiative in de
claring war. Unless therefore the Greeks
and the Turks break away from the con
trol of their leaders and force the bands
of Governments and bondholders alike
the present crisis, Ike those which have
preceded it, will drag itself out into petty
squabbles and end in nothing.
THE PANAMA CANAL
Data have boen recently furnished to the
public by the Technical Communion em
ployed on the survey of the Panama ca
nal to show that a feasible mid financially
practical plan for its construe ion has
been devised. It is also reponed hat the
plan has been adopted and that the canal
company is now making preparations for
the vigorous prosecution of the work.
According to these reports, the harbor
of tne canal at the Atlantic end will be
about the mean sea level, the tide being
of no account at that point. On the Pa
cific coast tbe harbor will vary between
the elevation of high tide and low tide.
The highest point of the oanal will be 34
tueters above the .Â«ea ievel. This rise will
be provided for by five lock* on each
slope. ThiÂ» supply of water for the canal
hto be taken lrom the Chaeres River,
and at the summit level the normal width
of the canal wiii ba 25 meters at the bot
tom and 50 meters at the water-line.
The reports given do not include esti
mates of t h* cost. It is stated, however,
tbat the company, which has now at work
more than 3000 men, has sent an aeent to
Jamaica to arrange for several thousand
more to push the enterprise. The con
struction is to be carried forward rapidly
and it is said that the promoters aro san
guine of success.
It is not clear whether these statements
deserve full credit or not. It has been no
ticed that whenever 'here is a prospect
that the United States will enter seriously
upon the work of constructing the Nicar
aguan canal reports of increased work on
the Panama enterprise are at once put
forth. Wnether these are intended
to discourage the Nicaraguan pro
ject or are to be used for the
purpose of stimulating Americans to
carry on that work in order that our
Government may have control of the great
interocean waterway is doubtful. Tuey
are calculated to work both ways, anÂ«l it
is not easy to decide in which direciion
the chief effect will be found.
As for the Panama scheme itself, de
spite the favorable reports which are so
often made public, it hardly seems likely
that It will ever be accomplished. At the
present time it appears to be very little
mere than a means whereby tie company
which holds the franchise is enabled to
draw money from the French people.
Both the Panama an! Nicaraguan routes
have been surveyed by competent engin
eers ana the weight of authority is decid
edly in favor of the Nicaraguan plan.
The statements issued by the Techuical
Commission, therefore, are not to be ac
cepted without hesitation. They are in
teresting, but it is by no means certain
that tney are reliable.

L. Feigenbanm, a merchant and wool-buyer
of Ronnervllle, Humboldt County, arrived
here yesterday, principally to seelc medical
advice, as He has been suffering for some 'ime
with sciatic rheumatism. In an interview
with Mr. Felgenbaum, who halls from the cen
ter of the wool-producing section of Northern
California, he said:
"I have been engaged in thts rich and un
devel- ped portion of California since a boy.
The town of Rohnerville is one of the oldest
settled towns in Humboldt County. The val
ley, which has a very rich soil where no lrrl-

gatlon ig required, has increased very rapidly
In population. Dairying, fruit-growing and
grain-raising are the principal industries
The mountain lands have been decreasing in
population. The latter I attribute to tho de
pression in the wool market caused by the
tariff l'-sne,"
Mr. Felgenbaum cayg that from his own
knowledge the owners of a number of large
aheap ranches were obliged to surrender their
entire possessions to tho banks. Ten years
ago the same parties were In excellent circum
stances, refusing $10 an acre for their land,
while now the same could not be sold.
Mr. Feigenbaum has had tons of wool stored
in hi* Humboldi, warehouse for months. Be
fore M( Kinley 's election It was impossible for
him lo get fin offer for wool. Since the elec
tion ho has had a number of offers, and he
now predicts that the lonely wool-grower of
the north will soon realize just and honest
reward for his industry through the McKlnley
tariff law.
He Is a close observer, has traveled exten
sively, and says there is no richer or better
soil under the skies for pastures, fruits and
grains than Kasteru and Southern Humboldt.
He compares the low land< with the Egyptian
soil, the richest in the world.

Letters From Our Readers on Topics of Curren
Interest.
A Friend of Lincoln.
Fditcr San Francisco Calt-SiR: Any one who has a heartfelt regard for Abraham "ncoln
will be moved profoundly over the mislortune whicn has overtaken Captain r Kf BC "" e ""
of Chicago. And I may remark in passing that I say -regard ior Lincoln" advisedly, ana noi
lor Lincoln's memory, for Lincoln U more than a memory to his countrymen. Among in m
whom Lincoln found most worthy of his personal friendship and official trust was ueorge
Schneider. In 1848, at the age of 25. he left Germany b. cause hi? political views were too UDerai
for the German Government of that day to tolerate. Ha was full of the spirit oi '48 in Europe, ana
hence was called a revolutionist Quite naturally he found his way to Illinois and in due time
became the persona! friend ft dauntless and resolute youne Lincoln. Quite as naiurany,
when Lincoln became President he chose George Scaneider to be special envoy to me aague
to represent the Government.
Those who have followed the financial history of the country during the war closely may
remember how difficult It was in 1861 to find a market in Europe for the first war bonas, ana
how, after repeatea failures to negotiate any considerab.e sale. President Lincoln selected
Captain Schneider t.o undertake the task. The high standing and diP lomfttl Â°*kimy oiine
special envoy soon accomplished that task and he found a market for oioona
issues, and subsequent issues found ready sale on the Continent. It gives a man the heariacne
to record what recently befell Captain Schneider at the age il 73.
On his return to the United States twenty odd yearj ago he founded the National Ban* ot
Illinois and was continuously the president up to a fatal day last December when the wnoxe
country was startled by the sudden collapse of the bank, for nothing could have been more
unexpected and apparently more mysterious. As I view it a brazeu crime was committed,
and if it be possible for Lincoln to mourn over events that are passing on earth ins noD.e
heart is pained as he comprehends the cause of the disaster which came with such a crushing
blow upon his old friend, Captain George Schneider. The story may be briefly told, the tacts
having come to hand within a day or two.
It will be remembered that the National Bank of Illinois owed a large sum of money to
depositors when its doors were closed in December, for it was in high iavor with the public
anrt had an unblemished record of twenty-five yeais It is not known to the general public,
probably not half a dozen readers of The Call, that the last dollar due depositors has already
been paid. I cannot recall a like instance in all the multitude of bank fuilures in thiscountry.
The fact that they were all paid in full within ninety days from the day the bank closed gives
the thoughtful reader a clew to the cruel crime committed against Captain Schneider and his
associates in the bank.
The blow fell upon the bank in this way, without a note of warning to Captain Schneider
or anjr officer of the bank: The fact has just been discovered that on bunday afternoon pre
vious to the failure on Monday the executive board of the Cienring-house Association of
Chicago met in private and decided to withdraw its support from the National Bank of Illi
nois, and when the news was published on Monday morning a rush was made on tbe bank ly
the a:armed depositors, when its doors were closed, and it passed into tbe hands of receivers.
It now appears that the bank thus suddenly crushed had a larger reserve fund on hand on
that fatal Monday morning than any other bank In Chicago or the whole country.
What was the motive which led to the withdrawal of support by the Clearing-house Asso
ciation? We all know the reason assigned, but the absolute solvency of the bank when the
support was withdrawn has now been demonstrated by the payment of the last dollar due de
positors, n iact which I do not believe could be accomplished under like conditions by any two
banks in the United States to-day. If the reader understands bank figures let him read the
bank statements which have appeared in the newspapers within the past ten days and judge
for himself. Very, few of them could pay 50 cents on the dollar within ninety days, as any one
can see who will read iheir published statements understandingly.
How then did the National Bank ot Illinois pay its depositors when thus suddenly forced
to the wall? Here is the pathetic answer: Captain Schneider gave up bis entire private for
tune, the accumulation of a lone lifetime, in a quiet and manly way, and the depositors are all
paid ; but at 73 he is left without resources, but not without honor â ;s found worthy of the
friendship of the immortal Lincoln. I close with the simple statement that the National Bank
of Illinois was a supporter of the financial heresy known as the free coinage of silver.

A TITLE DEED DISPUTE.
Daughters of the I.ate Police Sergeant
McKenna Say He Was Mentally
Unsound.
Nellie M. Lewis and L'llie G. Moran,
surviving daughters of the late Police Ser
geant Thomas D. McKenna, have insti
tuted a suit, by tlieir attorney, ex-Judge
A. A. Sanderson, to eet aside a deed which
re executed shortly before his death con
veying his real estate to his wife, Frances
F. M Kenna.
The ground stated for setting aside the
deed is that it was made without suffi
cient consideration.
It is shown by the complaint that Ser
geant McKenna's first wife died in this
City on be 15th of June, 1893, and that
on the 19th of June, 1896, ho waa married
to his second wife. It was on the 26ih of
last February that he deeded the property
to his second wife, and one week later he
died.
The daughters of the decedent allege
thttt their stepmother planned to defraud
them of any suare in the property that
was accumulate 1 by their father during
the time that he lived with their mother,
his first wife. They say that their step
mother falsely informed him that his
children did not care for him, and that as.
he wa9 sick and mentally weak she over
ruled and controlled his mind, so that his
act in signing the deed was not a volun
tary act on his part, and that he did not
understand the result of his attempt to
convey the title to the defendant without
consideration.
The properly in dispute is on Valencia
street, near Seventeenth, adjoining Mayor
James D. Phelan'a property on the south.
It is worth about $10,000. The will of Ser
geant McKenna lias been contested on
similar grounds.
FISH COMMISSIONERS.
Attention Has Been Called to the
Capture of Trout in Sonoma
Creek.
The Fish Commissioners are doing all
they can to suppress illegal trout-fishing,
but it seems that the poaeners watch the
movements of the patrol officials, and
when their backs are turned the capture
of trout by hook and spear goe3 merrily
on. The following letter was received to
day from a well-known angler who resides
in Sonoma and it speaks for itself:
Sonoma, March 21, 1897.
Sporting Editor Call: 1 noticed some time
ago that The Call stated that the Fish Com
missioners would dispatch deputies into the
coumry tor the purpose of stopping Illegal
fishing. Well there may have been officers
up this way lor all I know, but if tnere has
been any of the Commissioners patrolling the
Sonoma Creek, I think that they must have
looked over their shoulders quite irequontly,
otherwise they would certainly have see., nuy
number ot people ti tailing along the creek from
Glen Ellen to Sonoma. To-day (Sunday) quite
a number of fishermen were catching trout
above Glen Ellen, and if any of the Fish Com
missioners will spend a few days on the stream,
especially on Saturday or Sunday, they can
make a good killing on poachers. I just men
tion this because I think it is a shame that the
trout law is not observed as it should be in
this part of the country. Yours, etc.,

Ih9 Reserv:.
The Yosemlle Valley Commissioners
are proparing to extend the present ac
commodation for visitor to that pictir
esque locality, which has proved entirely
inadequate since the destruction of thai
Stoneman House by ti re last fail. T l l
Legislature has increased the central jl
propriation of $22,500 for two fiscal yea. f
by a grant of $S(KX) additional for needed
improvements, such at the repair and con
struction of buildings, cc.
At yesterday's meeting the board in
structed the finance committee to make
arrangements ior the renovation of the
old Hutchings house and to make the
guardian's office suitable for the reception
of cue-ta.
The Sentinel Hotel can provide 43 rooms,
the Hu-chings house 20 and the guard
ian's office 12, making a total ot 75 room?,
but even this accommodation must be in
creased before July 1, when the Christian
E ideavorers are likely to pay the valley a
visit. The board therefore instructed the
tlnance committee to consult with an
architect, with a view to the early con
struction of five cottages near the Sentinel
Hotel. The board, having every regard
for economy, will endeavor to make tha
extra $8000 go as far as possible, but
should this prove insufficient the unex
pended balance, if any there be, of the
general appropriation will be devoted to
the above-named purpose.
The only other business of public interest
transacted at yesterday's meeting was tha
board's acceptance of a letter drafted by
the secretary find addressed to the United
States Surveyor-General, asking for a
proper survey of the line between the
Yosemtte Vallty and the .National re
serve.

reached Suisun Bay. It was a clear moon

lashed the helm and went to sleep. The

still her owner thought he could make
San Francisco in her. He made the at

on the keel and hunz on there, for two

could do done with the plunger, and she
went. out to sea with the tide. .'

Meehan yesterday. '-There was nothing in
sight when I lashed the tiller ana went to
sleep, and as I had not closed my eyes for
twenty-four hours I did not require any

Quarantine Officer Dr. Chalmers had a
party of friends <>ut on the Governor Per
kins yesterday. The outing was a most
enjoyable one and all the principal points
of interest on the bay were visited.
Among those who were present were Sen
ator Thomas Flint Jr. and wife, Dr.
Keables and wife and Ssnator Voorheis
and wile.
The crew of the American ship T. F.
Oakcs assert that her long passage was due
to the fact that the captain insisted on
sailing on the 4th of July, and assert that
all the troubles that followed were also
due to that fact.
The battle-ship Oregon will leave for
the Port Orforrt dockyard next Thursday.
In ttie meantime Captain Barker has re
stored all the men to the first-class rank,
and yesterday three boatloads of them
came ashore to enjoy another run around
town bofore the vessel goes to sea.
Work on Folsom-street pier is rapidly
nearing completion. All the cylinders
are down and the only thing that remains
to be done is th* paving of the wharf and
the erection of the superstructure. The
pavin_- will probably be done with blocks
of Oregon pine -treated with the creosoting
process. It was at first intended to use
some redwood blocks, but the wood is so
brittle and splits so easily under pressure
that the chances are that nothing but cre
osoted blocks will be used throughout.
Chief Engineer Holmes of the Harbor
Commission will not express an opinion
In the matter, but. while his opinion is
firmly fixed in regard to the b!ock pave
menl ha will not say whether the creo-
soted article or the redwood is the better.
The consensus of opinion favors the Ore-
gou pine.
Tiiis will probably be the last day on
which Commissioner D. T. Cole will at
tend a meeting of the board in Jiis official
capacity. Mmjot Harney is back from
Sacramento and will assume oflice a< soon
as his bonds are approved. During his
term of oflice Mr. Coe has proved himself
io be nn upright, painstaking official, and
the State loses a good wvunt on his re
tirement. No one has during his terra of
< ffice made more friends than "Uncle
D.m," and no heartier congratulations
will come from any part of the State than
will be eiven him irom the "wafer-front

The new steamer Humboldt completed
her first round trip yesterday, making
the run from bar to bar in the record time
of 15 hours 15 minutes. Among the pas
sengers on the round trip was E. G. Wade,
the well-known marine reporter of the
Commercial Mews, and his two daughters.

PHELAN APPEALS
TO THE CITIZENS
The Boulevard Should Be
Finished With All
Dispatch.
His Personal Check for One
Thousand Dollars Swells
the Fund.
Supervisors Notified That Sutro and
the Spring Valley Have Signed
the Deeds.
To the Citizen* of San Franclico: To
day the deed* of right of way executed
by Adolph Sutro and the Spring Valley
Water Works for a boulevard 100 feot
wide, extending from Seventh avenue
past the Almahouge, and thence for a
mile to the Corbett road at Its junction
with -the Trocudero road, were pre
sented to the City by these generous
donors. It Is intended that this boule
vard shall be continued through the
Lake Merced property, a right of way
to which has been promised by the
Spring Valley Water Works, and thence
south to San Mateo County. The City
has but one outlet br land, and by the
grant of this right of way a great high
way is provided for th â  people, begin
ning at the Golden Gate Park and
extending indefinitely into the country.
In these day* of improved locomotion
it Is a matter of great importance to the
City of San f ranclsco to embrace this
opportunity of giving herself a perfect
road.
I therefore, at the request of the
committee In charge, appeal to all citi
zens to contribute toward its con
struction, and especially at this time,
when the employment of men tempo
rarily awaiting the opening of the sea
son is a great measure of relief. The
horseman, the bicyclist, the pedestrian,
will equally enjoy the benefits of this
road for generations to come, and it
will serve to wed the City and the
country. All that can be said in favor
of good roads can emphatically be
urged in favor of this movement on
account of the vast population such a
highway will serve and on account of
the large number of unemployed which
will be immediately benefited by Its
construction. I ag*in request all citi
zens realizing the importance of the
undertaking to send their con.ributions
to Daniel -Mover, treasurer, 216 Pine
street, without waiting for a call from
the committee.
JAMtS I>. PHUAN, Mayor.
Mayor Phelan l3sued this appeal to the
public on behalf of the new boulevard last
evening, and then showed his apprecia
tion of the advantages to be derived from
it by sending his personal check for $1000
to the committee in charge of the work.
At the meeting Hi the Board of Supervis
ors yesterday his Honor sent in the fol
lowing communication relative to the

torney in order that he may regularly trans
mit hi* opinion to the Hoard of Supervisors.
I congretuiate the board upon me itratit of
thpse rights of way, wh:ch will result m the
ci nstruciion of a much needed boulevard and
be v, substantial addition to the possessions of
the City and County. Kespectiuily,
James D. Phelan, Mayor.
IT'S WORK OR NO MEALS.
The Old Organized Unemployed
Adopt a New Name and
a Labor Test.
Yesterday over 250 men were at work on
the boulevard. But another 150, for
whom tickets had been issued, had not re
ported for duty. And this, in the face of
the fact that in addition to the 400 men so
far accepted, there were enrolled as appli
cants wnen the office closed yesterday 1650
other men apparently eager for a chance
to work.
The men are being accepted just as fast
as more can be used to advantage with
out getting in each other's way upon tbe
limited stretch of road thus far operated
upon.
Every cent that is being contributed for
the boulevard is expended only ior man
ual labor. Implements and supplies are
all contributed. Up to date $729 90 has
been paid to men for whose special benefit
the worn was provided. And these men
are doing good work. None of them are
guilty of the shirking familiar to many
visitors to the park during a like benefit
two years ago.
Suoscriptions to the boulevard fund
have reached a total of $9710 70. of which
there is a balance on baud of $8980 80, not
more than a third of what is necessary io
complete the first part of the boulevard,
and far too little to give work to more
than a fourth of the 2050 men that want it
and need the $1 a day.
The organized unemployed, as such in
name, notion ger exist. They held one of
their typical stormy meetings last night
mill formally evolved into the "Horn* and
Help Supply Association," by which
name they have applied for a charter as a
regular corporation, with a nominal capi
tal stock oi $1,000,000 and an actual fund
of $135 threatened with serious inroads in
cident to a normally hungry but unpro
ductive, small army.
The evolution was a simple process and
a very pleasantone. The unemployed shed
their* skins â figuratively speaking, and
only figuratively speaking â ana came
forth a corporation as yet unused to
watered stock, to the luxuries or my&te
ries of bathrooms, laundries, reading
rooms and other accommodations outlined
among the optimistic probabilities of the
"Home" to be.
With the actual institution of the new
regime came a commenduble but almost
compulsory plan, one that might well
have been put to the test a month ago.^
By a large vole, with less than a fourth of
the assembled 300 men sheepishly oppos
ing the proposition, it was decided that
hereafter those who do not turn out and
help to pull the supply wagon through
the streets on its collecting tour shall not
eat.
The first crucial test is to be made this
morning. By the number that hold the
rope to- lay will be judged the general sin
cerity of the body of men thai ha* rele
gated to oblivion the term Organized Un
employed; that has attempted to free it
self from the reproaches and disfavor
lately attaching to it. as an institution
where many appeared chronically idle
and willing to see others hustle lor the
contributions of which they willingly
enough partook during the day and were
loudest to wraugle over at the nightly
meetings.
The lardejr is empty, and to-day tho
lazy ones must do a little untaxing labor
or leave the headquarters to those alone
whose willingness to do something will
insure them the confidence and sympathy
of the community.
For the present the old quarters will be
occupied, and perhaps daily swept out
and aired a little.'
Meanwhile an effort will be made to find
a suitable place lor permanent occupancy.
Perhaps the old Salvation Army Lifeboat,
on Jackson street, may be secured to-day.
At last night' 9 meeting it was decided
to make the First National Bank treasurer
of the association.
LOUGHEAD IS A
RECORD-BREAKER
Two- Mile Mark Went A-
Glimmering at the Pa
vilion Meet.
Dashing Riding of Professionals
on the Steep Track Kept
the Audience on Edge.
Another larse audience greeted the
cycle racers at the Mechanics' Pavilion
last evening, tbe second night of tbe big
indoor tournament. There was a longer
and more interesting programme, if pos
sible, then that run off Saturday night,
and the excitement at times reached the
fever heat, particularly in the professional
events.
There is no question but what the pro
fessionals lend more vim and dash to their
racing than do the amateurs, which is
only natural wnen it is considered tnat
they are racing for prizes about three
times more valuable, and cash prizes at
that.
There were six more professionals en
tered, bringing the number up to twenty
four, and among the new comers the stars
were Walter Foster, California's favorite,
and Fred J. Loughead, the Canadian
champion, whose speedy riding and
charming manners promise to win him a
warm place in tha heart of California au
diences. Of the other Easterners Jay
Eaton showed the best in the preliminary
heats of the two miles, both Becker and
Starbuck being shutout from the final.
Loughead demonstrated nis remarkable
speed in the final of the two- mile pro
fessional, when he lowered the world's
record to 4 rain. 24 sec. and defeated
Eaton, McFarland and Jones.
Bus was the star of the amateur per
formers of the evening, winnin? the half
mile scratch race as he pleased from a
large fieid. His principal opponent wa"
Kenna, who fell in his semi-final heat and
coukl not qualify.
Some good riding was seen in the two
mile open, professional, heats. Stevens of
lowa won the first heat in a pretty finish
from Hardy Downing, Walter Foster and
Herbert McCrea. The secon i went to
Eaton of Chicago, who boat the local
cracks, the Terrill brothers. Starbuck,
tne long-distance champion, Allen of
Spokane, and Wells and Whitman of Cai
liornia contested the third heat. Tney
made the two miles in lightning time,
riding the last quarter in 27 seconds.
Wells won by 'a good margin.
Longhead, tbo Canadian champion,
Dow of Seattle, Bovee of Texas and Davis
of San Jose rode in the fourth. Loughead
outclassed his field, winning as he
pleased. Allan Jones made a good win of
the filth heat, beating Slater of Arizona
and Boyden of Alameda. In the sixth
were Becker, the five-mile champion,
Morris of Texas, Byrne of the Imperial
Club and McFarland of San Jose. Becker
could do no better than tbird, McFarland
winning, Morns second. The last eighth
was ridden in 134-5 seconds, record time.
The semi-finals were run in mile heats
and tne preliminary heats should have
been. The starters in the first semi-rinal
were Stevens, Eiton, Downing and Terrill.
This was a pretty race. Eaton jumped to
the front on the fiftn lap and started a
Ion? sprint with the others closely follow
ing." Downing held second place until the
last turn when Terrill parsed him and al
most nipped out Eaton at the tape.
The riders of the second semi-finals were
Wells, Loughead, Allen and Dow. Allen
jumped early in the ride, but Loughead
and Wells soon took his measure and fin
ished one, two. They bumped together
on the last turn, but kept their heads and
did not fall, saving the tw.> behind them.
Jones, McFarlary^ and Morris competed
in the third. Jones hardly waited for the
siarter's gun before he was off like a shot,
with the others tagging after him at a
goodly clip. They exchanged the pace
setiing every other lap till the last and
then sprinted for home. Jones was last,
but cat in on the pole and came home a
winner, McFarland second.
This brought into the final Jones,
Loughead, Eaton and McFarland. To
make it as fast and interesting as possible
single pacemakers were put in, and the
innovation proved a good one. Ssullivan
set the pace for the first mile and made it
liiihtnine fast. Tbe first mile was made
in" 2:14 45. Here Morris swung in, and
the pace was even hotter than before.
Loughead still held first place behind the
pacemaker, t c order being Loughead,
McFarland, Jones, Eaton.
The pacer swung out on the sixth lap,
and then one of the greatest fights ever
seen on a California track took place.
Eaton jumped to tha pole, fighting suie by
side with Loughead. Jones came up from
behind with * desperate sprint and
crowded out McFarland, Dot slipped on
the last turn and fell heavily. Loughead
proved the best man of the two leaders,
and won with room to spare, in the re
markable time of 4:24, a world's record.
To show that ha was unhurt Jones re
mounted his wheel after his fall and rode
it to bit dressing-room.
The longest event on tbe programme
was the half mile scratch, amateur, which
on account of an exceptionally big entry
list had to be divided into nine heats,
three semi-finals and a final. The winners
of the heats were: G. A. Wvman, Acme;
X. L. Alborelle. W. S. Bacon, E. F. Ru^s
The Perfume of Violets 1
The purity of the lily, the glow of the rose,!
and the flush of Hebe combine in Poszoni's|

Â«nd Morris M. Cook, Olympic; J. R.
Kenna, F. G. LaÂ«ev and T. A. Griffith?,
Bay City, and R. KobinÂ«on, San Fran
isco Road Ciub. Tbe-e contested in the
emi-finals, narrowing the field down to
Morris Cook, Bacon, Rnss and Lacey.
Alborel c fell in tbe second semi-final and
Kenna in the third, but neither was a bit
hurr. The accidents were caused by the
tires on their wheels exploding.
Russ made a runaway race of tbe final,
taking the lead early in the journey and
setting a clip the others could not over
take. He won in the speedy time of 1:11,
Bacon a good second, Cook third.
The first heat cf the five-mile enp race
was contested by C. M. Smith, represent
ing the Olympic Cycler?; C. D. Goocb,
Relinnco Club, and G. A. Wyman, Acme
Club. It was paced by Scbeerer and
Honijrsberger on a tandem.
Smith was first to catch on behind the
pacers, who set a pretty hot clip from the
start, considering tbe longdistance to be
ridden. Wyman got behind the tandem
after the tirst mile. The pacing was very
j<?rky a:id rather spoiled what might hare j
oeen a good race. Smith was forced to
drop out at the end of the third mile, ow
ing to tbe poor pacing. In a pretty finish.
Gooch won from Wyman, the* time for the
five miles being 11:55 2-5.
The second heat of the five-mile clab
cup race was contested by Cummings,
Alameda Cyclers; Robinson, San Fran
cisco Road Ciub; Lacey, Bay City, and
Birdsall, California Clab. They were
paced by Davidson and Griffiths, tbe crack
Bay City tandem team, and the pace was
steady and even, about a 2:20 clip for the j
first three miles, livening up a little to
ward the end. Lacey won in a sprint,
Robinson second, Birdsall third. Cum
mings made a game ride. The time was
11:40.

SIXTY WOMEN CAUGHT
IN THE DRAGNET.
A Coup to Gather la Some
Recent Arrivais for De
portation.
THIRTEEN SUSPECTS HELD FOR
EXAMINATION.
The Initial Step in What Promises to
Become a Nasty Custom-Hous)
Scandal.
The officials of the Treasury Depart
ment are about to inaugurate a vlporous
campaign against the illegal landing of
SEPARATING THE GOATS FROM THE LAMBS.
The Police Department, at the request of the Special Agents of the Treasury, raided the principal brothels in China
town yesterday and gathered in sixty of the inmates. Of this number thirteen were taken into custody on suspicion of
being illegally landed, after comparison with photographs in the Chinese Bureau. The Treasury Department will bring
their cases at once before the United States Commissioners and hope to effect their deportation. There are rumors that a
big Custom-house scandal is to follow.
Chinese women in this port and incident
ally deal a blow at the traffic the local
missions have long fought in vain.
Possibly there is something deeper than
mere purposes of morality in tnis de
cision of the officers of the Government.
There are rumors that the long-talked-of
scandals about the Custom-house are to
be ventilated.
By way of beginning, a round-up of a
number of the most unsavory places in
Chinatown was made yesterday afternoon
for the purpose of petting into custody
fourteen Chinese women who recently ar
rived here from Asia and against whom
the treasury agents have evidence by which
they hope to deport them. It was a raid
such as the Mongolian quarter has not
seen since the death oi Little Pete, when
Sergeant Price turned loose his squad on
the joss-houses, poker-rooms and high
binders.
The plan of the attack had been care
fully planned by Special Auent Moore of
the Treasury Department, but its execu
tion was assigned to the police depart
ment. Captain Wittman had charge of
operations, assisted by Sergeants Cooke
and Helms and twenty-eight police offi
cers. In all sixty Chinese women fell into
the police dragnet, and in tuis number
the Treasury Department discovered thir
teen of the lourteen suspects they were on
th* lookout for.
Elaborate preparations had been made
for the raid. The treasury people nad pre
pared a map of Chinatown showing the
location of the principal disreputable
houses. The most important of these es
tablishments were selected for the on
slaught, and Wittman tod off his force
in squads accordingly. The inmates of
nine houses in all were gathered in.
Ttie onslaught was made simultaneously
at all places at 12 o'clock, and was as sud
den-as it wa3 unexpected. There was no
hitch in the success of the plan, and half
an hour later the Presbyterian Mission
house at 920 Sacramento street was filled
with as motley a throne of the women of
the Chinese slums as was ever gathered to
gether.
There was no ceremony in the descent
of the Dolice. Divided into squads of
three, they hammered down barred doors
and dived into dark stairways and blind
corridors in a way that caused a panic all
filong the lines. The two houses in Bartlett
p.lley, near Pacific, were regular beehives
and yielded eighteen people to tbe drag
net.
At 744 Washington and 822 Jackson
street, two of the ruo3t notorious resorts
in Chinatown, a wholesale clean-up was
effected. Two other houses on the south
aide of Washington street, near Dupont,
the houses at 22, 23 and 25 Sullivan alley
and one on the north side of Baker alley,
near Sullivan alley, completed the hsr.
The women were arranged in the order
of their arrest at the mission-house, and
were carefully scrutinized by Interpreter
Gardiner, who had beÂ»-n detailed to iden
tify them by Special Agent Moore. Gar
diner compared each and ail with a batch
of photographs from the Chinese bureau,
wich a reÃDit that after two hours 1 tedious
work he found thirteen of those whom
the police were most anxious to get. The
moment this decision took place the re
mainder of the women were escorted to
their various houses by the police and
quiet and peace once more reigned in the
Chinese half worM.
Not so with the unlucky thirteen. As
soon as they discovered they were marked
for further iilentitication there was a wail
ing and a tom-toming that the widows of
Ashur could not approach. The women
were formally placed under arrest by
Gardiner, amid general hysteria. An
apartment in the upper floor of the mis
sion-house was converted into a temporary
bastile, and here the sebbing Chinawomen
spent the night in charge of Officer Kerri
son.
Tho names of the suspects are Poon
Kam, Yuen Lin, Cnang Ngan Ying, Wai
Lim Oy, Yme Ho, Yehe Ho, An Kew,
Yuet You, Yuet Kan, Tai Choy. Ah Tai,
Xh Yuet and Ah Ngan. For the most
part they are in their teens and are all re
cent arrivals in this City. The places
where they were found leave no doubt as
to the purpose for which they were
brought here.
It is the programme of the special agents
of the treasury to make a test case of thÂ»se
thirteen women. They will be arraigned
before Commissioner HeacocK at one*,
and the Government hopes to prove that
they have been illegally landed and will
ask for their deportation. If this is ac
complished there is likely to be a sad de
crease in the female population of China
town, as it is the general belief of the offi
cials that not one in ten of the Chinese
women in this City are here legally. The
deportation o! these women would proba
bly result in wholesale raids on all the dis
reputable places in Chinatown.
There are rumors of an uely scandal
stalking behind the present proceedings.
For a long time there" have been intima
tions on the part of the Treasury Depart
ment that Chinese were coming illegally
into Ibis port in large numoers. The ar
rival of Special Agents West, Cullorn and
Channinn from Washington some weeks
ago added a peculiar sienincance to these
reports. Since that time it has been com
mon talk about the Federal building that
there were Jto be some exposures in Cus
tom-house circles, that would be far
reaching and implicate many people.
Those who place credence in these rumors
say tuat yesterday's work is the begin-
ning of the interesting things that are to
come.
For months past Moore and the secret
service people have silently but surely
been preparing plans for a vigorous cam
paign aeainst the system of importing
Chinese in direct violation of the exclu
sion act. They discovered that the busi
ness was flourishing and constantly on
the increase. The traffic in women was
an incentive to the importation of large
numbers of Chinese girls, and in almost
every instance these passed right under
the nose of the custom officials.
It happens ti. at the records of Chinese
registration do not extend farther bacic
than 1882. Thus, when a young girl was
landed it was customary in ca c of any
dispute with the officers, to produce affi
davits that she was born in tnis country
and prior to 1882. It was the late Little
Pete tbatdeveloped this system, and much
of his fortune was made in the importa
tion of women.
o:>ce in San Francisco the immigrants
commanded a good price, and thus the
business of importing girls was further
stimulated by the certain prospect of big
reward.
Some time ago one of the Six Companies
made a move to stop this trade in live
stock and employed Attorney Henry E.
Monroe to devise some meaas to put a
check to the illegal importations. Monroe
was seconded in his efforts by the various
missionary societies, and he discovered
evidence which led nim to believe that the
real fault lay with the Custom-house
people. This he communicated to the
treasury agents and requested their as
sistance. In the course or their investiga
tions they found that almost as soon as a
girl passed the Custom-house examination
she fell into the hand-, of the keepers of
the disreputable houses.
ahe "father," who had stood sponsor
for the details of her birth, disposed of
i er, immediately after she was safely
landed, to the highest bidder. There are
at the present time over 500 inmates in
the Chinatown dens, all of whom the
: treasury officials believe are here as a re
sult of either the willful fraud or careless-
I ness on the part of the Custom-house
I officials.
Special Agent Moore absolutely refus s
to say what the next move will be. It is
known that for some time past, special de
tectives have been in his employ investi
ga ing every detail connected with the
landing of Chinese in this City. The re
sult vf this work the treasury officials will
not discuss. But the finger is beginning
to point in various directions, and it is on
the card that there are revelations to
come.
The Anaphrodisic Company of Paris,
France, with United States headquarters
at Chicago, is about to incorporate in San
Francisco with a capital of $100,000.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MABCH 23, 1897.
THOSE BIG HATS
ARE NOW SAFE
Supervisor Rottanzi's The
ater Ordinance Is
Killed.
Joseph Cuneo Claims Big Dam
ages' Against the Munici
pality.
Professor Neumann Asks the City to
Protect the Natural California
Silkworm.
"Knocked Into a cocked hat" is an ex
pression lhat might aptly have been ap
plied to Supervisor Rottanzi's ordinance
against the wearing of large headgear by
ladies while at the theater when the
Supervisors got through with the measure
yesterday.
It is not generally known whether or
not Supervisors Smith, Sheehan and Lack
man, who compose the Judiciary Commit
tee, are married men, but if not they must
have lady friends who delight in the lofty
creations of the milliner's art, for they
unanimously recommended that the order
be laid on the shelf.
When the matter came up in the regular
order of business there were evidences
that other Supervisors had harkened to
the voices of their fair friends, for only
twoâ Dodge and Britt â voted with the
author of the ordinance against indefinite
postponement. So the ladies may if they
choose and their pin money permits wear
airy towers of Babel on their heads while
at the local playhouses.
Joseph Cuneo made a demand on the
board for $4000 claimed to be due as dam
age done bis property on Taylor street be
tween Bay and Francisco by reason
of a broken sewer.
The matter was referred to the Judiciary
Committee.
Application of a contractor to have his
bid for certain public work withdrawn re
sulted in a discussion a; to whether such
a proceeding if generally allowed would
not be detrimental to the public good.
A motion was made and carried that in
future no bid be allowed to be withdrawn
because contractors might use this means
to combine and defeat the very object of
getting bids to eet the work done at the
lowest possible price.
A resolution was passed indefinitely
postponing the abandonment of Branch
Jail 3 as recomended by the Board of
Health.
It wastlecided to require that all City
printing bear the label of the Allied Prim
ing Trades, unless the label shall disfigure
the documents. The maiter of deciding
which siiail and which shall not bear
the label was left to the chairman of the
Printing Committee.
The National AthletWClub was granted
a permit for a boxing entertainment at
the People's Palace on April 1.
Supervisor Clinton offered a resolution
that was adopted instructing the Chief of
the Fire Department to furnish a list of
the tire hydrants that in his opinion may
be dispensed with.
In support of his resolution Dr. Clinton
said that he had heard that there were a
large number of unnecessary hydrants
about the City for which the municipality
paid $60 per year each, and that if such
was the case they ought to be dispensed
with. The resolution passed.
The following communication relative to
the native California silkworm was re
ferred to the Board of Park Commis
sioners:
GenVemen: I, the undersigned, most re
spectfully CBll your attention to â¢ matter of
ereai importance, in which, during my study
from 1884 until now, I have become con
vinced that the matter which 1 am now laying
before you will become of immense value no;
only to our City and County, but also to the
State, namely, my discovery of the native Cali
fornia silkworm and its lood Dlant, the Cas
cara sagrado, or, Â»s commonly called, the
California wiid coffee plant.
This plant, including the worm, from my
observation, has become almost extinct in this
City and County since ihe beginning of the
grading of Sutro, Richmond, Presidio and
I'oints Lobos heignts, and if something is not
done soon to prevent Its lotal destruction It
will become almost impoÂ«sibie to continue Its
study and to practically demonstrate its value
to our people, who will in time bring silk cul
ture and the manufacture of silks to a great
success in this State.
The boulevard under course of construction
now will add to the destruction of the plant
and worm if no timely provision is made. On
account of this fact and the great importance
of the matter. I respectfully suggest that a
tract oi land in the park ba set apart for the
purpose of cultivating these plants after they
nave been taken up and transplanted.
I know that this will accomplish wonders in
the revival and advancement of thin great In
dustry and a i the same time add a new feature
of (rreat interest to visitors at the park. My
services are at your disposal In the supervision
of the undertaking. Joseph Neumann,
Professor of Silk Culture.

THE RAILS WILL
BE TAKEN UP
Supervisors Order Stockton-
Street Obstructions
Removed.
Property-Owners Could Get No
Satisfaction From the
Company.
The Superintendent cf Streets In
structed to Proceed Forthwith
to Clear the Pavement.
The Board of Supervisors brought the
matter of removing the disused streetcar
rails from Stockton street between O'fcar
rell and Ellis streets to a focus yesterday
by the adoption of the following resolu
tion, offered by Supervisor Devany:
Resolved, By the Board of Supervisors of the
City and County of San Francisco, that the
abandonment 01 tracks on Stockton street be
tween Ellis and Geary and Geary and Post
streeta by '.he Market-street Railway Company
be accepted, and that the Superintendent of
Streets be directed to remove the rails, the
company haviug lailed to do so as promised in
their letter of abandonment, forthwith.
'Previous to the introduction of the reso
lution Mayor Phelan presenled the follow
ing communication:
San Francisco, March 22, 1897.
To the Honorable Board of Supeitisor* of the
City and County of San Francisco â Gentlemen:
1 herewith transmit to you a communication
irom the representatives of the property-own
ers en S.octtou street, between Ellis and
O'Farreil, which. Is self-explanatory:
These gentlemen were acting with the
knowledge and consent of the City in provid
ing for the pavomentof its accepted street, viz.:
Siockton street, between Ellis and O'Furreli,
and fiuy communication they may have re
ceived from the Markel-street Railway Com
pany is of an official character and enti
tled to full credence by this board.
They hr.ye handed me the communication
abandoning the tracks on Siockton street,
meaning thereby from El.is to Geary and Irom
Geary to Post streets, by the Market
street Ra.lway Company, which I now present
to the board with the recommendation that
the abandonment be accepted and the com
pany be ordeietl to remove iti. rails forthwitn,
in order iiiat the board may readvertlee for
bids for the pavement of the entire roadway.
Unless the truck be abandoned by the com
pany, and the City accepts such abandon
ment, I am informed by the Superintendent of
Streets that he cannot so advertise.
As further evidence of abandonment, I call
your attention to the fact that the cars have
not run over the said tracks, of which I am
reliably informed, for a period of over six
years, and that the tracks do not connect with
any other tracx*, and hence are incapable of
use. Respectluliy,
James D. Phelan, Mayor.
The Superintendent of Streets, when ad
vertising for the paving of the streets,
failed, through ignorance of this fact, to
make the proper prevision for the space
occupied Dy the rails.
Mr. Vinmg was called upon to ascertain
whether or not the company would re
move the rails so that the street could be
paved under the original plans. They re
ceived no satisfaction, thouch they had
the following letter from an official of the
company:
0. D. Baldwin, Esq., vice-prertdtnt American
Bank and Trust Company, lilyâ Dear ;-ir: In
accordance with our conversation this is to
advise; you tbat the Market-street Railway
Company nas abandoned Its tracks on Stock
ton street and will remove the rails. Yours
truly, K. P. Schwerin, Manager P. and S.
The committee thereupon applied to the
Mayor, with the result tbat the matter
was summarily disposed of.

"I feel sad everj time â  I see a woman."
The aboTe remark was made to the writer
by one of the oldest and most prominent
physicians in New York. 7
"13 it possible that you are a woman-
hater," doctor?" "V: :
> "Not :at all, but I have seen so much
suffering, so many women, who are miser-
able, that I cannot help feeling sorry for
them all. How many ladies do you know
that are perfectly well and healthy? Ho n
many enjoy life as they should?; Is ibis
not enough to make one feel sorrowful?
: "There must be a cause for all this, doc-
tor." '. Â,v v* [ '-. - :. â ' .; , i-y~,h(i~i
"There is. When a woman is weak, she
requires strength. > All her functions must
be put in a healthy condition. â  Nothing
does this co easily and surely as pure
spirits taken in moderation, either before
meals or between, meals. I know scores
of ladies that are kept in perfect health
and brilliancy by the judicious use of
Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey. Many of
these Jadies are wives of professional
men, and most :of them are tÂ«nwr-
ance women. Tney realize that Duff/'s
Pure tAVhiskey furnishes the bestan<i
only positive help, and they are intelli-
gent enough to profit by such knowledge.
The best temperance people of to-day are
the ones who use pure spirits in moder-
ation, and find that str ngtb, vigor, color
and brightness are the results."

A citizen of Kansas City, Mo., says : " For a number of years I
suffered from constipation in its severest form. My liver failing to act
for a week, I have tried any number of specifics and have also had
physicians prescribe for me, but received only temporary relief. I
had my attention first called to
RIPANS Tabufes
by a small sign on a telegraph pole which said ' One Gives Relief ' I
procured some and before I had taken half a dozen I began to feel the
good effect, especially from the pain I would suffer when my liver was
trying to act I now have no more trouble. My bowels act regular
and free, and as a result my health is much improved."

at io to Iâ David Also Won
at Long Odds
Ingleside Track reopened yesterday with
Â» large crowd in attendance and a card
that looked freckled with soft spots for
two or three horses. These same soft j
spots were the stumbling-blocK over !
which the talent Jell and donated quite j
liberally to the gentlemanly layers of '
prices in the ring.
Imp. Santa Bella, a 1 to 4 choice, was
the first that failed to connect, and was
followed by five other favorites which
grew weary before reaching the stand.
Among these outsiders was old David, I
who captured the final race ridden by '
Thorpe at the cherry ripe odds of 12 to 1.
Â»\.Dd by the wav, this same jockey,
Waorpe, was in rare cood form himself,
-ihe premier Western rider was past the
wire first on four occasions, finished sec- j
ond on Napmaax and brought up third on ;
Key del Tierra; a very good lecord for |
one day.
The Androus stakes for two-year-olds, !
r.t four and a half furlongs, worth $1000 to j
i!ie winner, was the special feature of the !
programme, and was annexed by Tom j
Griffin's good filly Martha, a daughter of I
Dandie Dinmont and Louise T. The i
Burns & Waterhouse pair, Napamax and |
Thorpe, held sway in the betting at odds
of 11 to 10, with Martha next in demand
with 3 to 2 about her. The others received
little consideration from speculators.
The start was a good one, and Sloan, on
Martha, soon showed in the lead. The i
spry miss maintained the lead to the end, :
deleaiing Napamax cleverly by iess than j
a length in :55}4. Thorpe was an averaee
third.
. Tha opener was a i-ix furlppg purse
affjir. With Yankee Doodle, Saliie |
Clicquot and Gutta Percba scratched, Mr. j
Jlacdonough's handsome mare, imp. i
Santa Bella was a prohibitive 1 to 4 choice, i
She was away from the barrier slowly, '
and was beaten in the run home by Dr. j
Howell's Satsuma with Thorpe up, a 5 to 1 i
cnance in the ring.
An outsider showed to excellent ad
vantage in the mile and a sixteenth sell
ing run. George Palmer was at first made
favorite, but gave way in the betting to
Rey del Tierra, which witli Thorpe ud
was played down to 6 to 5 favoriti m. The i
latter colt ran flatteringly to the stretch,
where he began showing distress signals.
Below the furlong pole Scarborough, a 30 j
to 1 shot, piloted by Hennessy, took the
lead, winning easily from S . Distaff in
1:4S? : Â£. The favorite was third, beaten a!
hem i tor the place.
The veteran roan sprinter Tim Murphy, I
apparently possessed of a new lea^e of â¢
tine, came out in a six-furlong sprint that
followed and at odds of 10 to 1 kÂ«d aJ the I
way, and at the wire be.it Meadow Lark
half a lenmn in liiS%. The even-money
choice, Mobalaska, away poorly, was a
Lang-up third.
Ed Corrigan's Can't Dance, Me Light !
and Double Quick declined ;he issue in j
The mile and a furlong run, which left !
Perseus to go to the post a 9 to 20 choice. !
Purser's gelding led from start to finish, j
winning handiiy from Morie Fonse in |
1:65& Joe Terry stayed with the leader to 'i
the sireich. where he began tiring.
Ifor the iinal seven-furlong event Cash |
Day was a stationary ti to 5 favorite and j
uidn't iand within the money. True Blue i
and Hohenzollern were the conspicuous
ones to ihe stretch, where the bunch |
closed on them. About the furiong pole j
old" David drew out of the bunch and won

A. M. Allen, who superintended the con

the Australian gate yesterday was ve"ry
good.
K. J. Havey will assume his duties as

Bob McGibben. he of the mighty lungs,
replaced Jack Dinue as caiier at lnjrleside
yesterday. Bob's calling could distinctly
be heard at Barrjey Farley's old road
house, aud was algrand innovation for the
hillsi bookmakers. .â¢ . .
Eighteen bookmakers laid prices in the
big ring. ' .
Salmera, the Salvator filly, made a very
good showing in the Androus stake, and
should be about due to win a race in the
near future. She ran in Billy Randall's
colors.
That \:Tt\i for seven furlongs that Cash
Day registe.ed one day last week over at
Oakland has proven â  very goou thing for
the bookmakers. Either Henry Shields
or the old horse has sadly retrograded
since that occasion. Surely the ride put
up by Shields yesterday will earn him no
niedals or diplomas.

Blew Out the Gas.
A man about 50 years of age, fairly well
dressed, rented a room in a lodging-house at
22 Sacramento street Sunday nigut. Ho was
drunk at the time. Yesterday morning he
was found unconscious in b&U. with the gas
turned on. He was taken 10 the Receiving
Hospital, and Dr. Weil expressed the opinion
that ne would not recover. There were no
p-ipers in his pockets that wouid lead to his
identification. It is thought that in his
drunken state he had blowu out. the gas.
Held for Burglury.
Paul Graves, alias Milton Berry, was held by
Judge Joachimseu yesterday to answer before
the Superior Court ou ihe charge of bur-tary
in $1000 bonds. He broke into the nouse of
\V. B. Pierce, 150 Soa street, on February 17,
and stole a number of articles. This is the
second charge on which the young man bus
been held.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 23, 1897.
EX-GOVERNOR HORACE BOIES OF IOWA.
Ex-Governor Horace Boies, the distinguished lowa Democrat whose name has so
prominently been connected with the Presidency, and who polleJ sixty-seven ballots
on the first vote at the Chicago National Convention, is a guest at the Hotel Mentone,
Sacramento and Powell streets.
The veteran lowan, who led his party to victory in the Hawkeye State, did so after
thirty-five years of unbroken KepubHcan rule. Not oniy tbi'>. but he was re-elected,
and he stands to-day the only Democratic Governor of that State for forty-two years.
Naturally he is a power there, but he has great strength also over the Nation. He is a
piciuresque gentleman, with snow-white hair cut rather close, and wearing a black
Prince Albert coat and black tie. Thus attired he appears much like the minister of
a well-to-do congregation. He is of good height and has a commanding appearance.
The ex-Governor has been visiting Southern California for the past two weeka.
He was there for a time ten years ago, during the boom that swept over that part of
the Sta'.e. There are many lowa people there and among them the Governor has
many friends, tie said tie had a delightful trip and was now looking over the sights
of Sail Francisco, a city which he had never before seen.
The ex-Governor touched on politics, the condition of business, the tariff and the
McKinley Cabinet. He is an incisive and interesting conversationalist.
"The money question will always be a living issue in my judgment," said he, i: till
we get back to some standard of bimetallism. Bryan's deieat does not mean that
the people do not want bimetallism. Some of the people who voted for McKiniey
doubtless thought Bryan's success would mean silver monometallism instead of bi
metallism. I have never been absolutely certain that the ratio of 16 to 1 was the right
thing, but I was. confident that if it was not the Democratic party if in power would
so change it as to brine about actual bimetallism. I thought the Democratic position
the safer cf the iwo, because the result of the Republican idea would be cold mono
metallism. XÂ» to tbe trusts and combines, I think they all ought to be worked out I
do not think there is much disagreement among leading members now about that. I
think the McKiniey Cabinet i 3 oompo-sed of quite able men, but 1 look for no great
improvement through the tar. ff or other measures. But business mustfiom the pres
ent condition of necessity improve some."
SOUTH PARK IS
NOW THE CITY'S
It Was Transferred to the
Supervisors Yester
day.
George Gordon's Old Ideas May
New* Ec Carried
Out
Ha Built a Pleasure Grouod, but It
Had Fallen Far Into
Deca7.
South Pars, the ideal pleasure ground
as laid out in the early '60's by its owner,
George Gordon, after years oJ neglect has
passed into the hands of the City.
At the time that Gordon was the sole
owner of the properly bounded by Second,
Third. Bryant and Brunnan streets he
conceived t lie idea of following out the
Englisb plan of having a private pleasure
ground located in the center of the block
for the exclusive benefit of the owners
and residents of the property in that par
ticular neighborhood.
This idea led to the oval-shaped -park in
ihe center of the biock mentioned, with
the expressed corulit ions in the deeds of
conveyance made to each purchaser wnen
buying from Gordon that they would re
s' rye and keep in order that portion laid
out as a pleasure ground.
This agreement was lived up to by the
lot-owners for a number of years. Buy in
those days Kincon Hill was t tie. Nob Hill
ol the town and South .Park was the quar
ters for tbp aristocracy.
In the latter days mining and railroad
king : made California-street hill the
horn <of the modern millionaire, and the
Kincon Hill palaces lost their glory, South
Park fell into disuse, the dwellings crum
bled away, the grass grew on the road
way circling the park, the walls and
gates fell victims to the rigors of many
winters and the entire place went into
decay.
Kecentlv it was decided by those most
interested thut the park would do better
under the care ol the City, aud the docu
ment of transfer was liled with the Ke
corder yesterday.
The following property-owners signed
the transfer:
W. J-. Adams, Adelaide McCrossen, George S.

WITH THE LABOR UNIONS.
The Marble- Work era Will Demand a
;:ui-.< Â«.f Wages.
There was a lively and interesting meet
ins of ihe Marble Cutters' and Finishers'
Association last evening at 1019% Market
street. The most important business was
the decision to gire the bosses notice of a
demand for a raise in wages, the increase
to go iuto effect at once. At present the
cutters are receiving $3 a day and the
finishers $2.
Hereaft-r the cutlers will demand $3 25
and the linisuers $2 25. It was further de
cided that on and aner May 1 in all shops
nine hours shall constitute a day's work
and that there will be no more piecework
done. At ttie present time the men are
working; nine and ten hours a day and
p ecework is done. Whether the bosses
will Mibmit to these changes remains to
be seen, but the union leels strong enough
to tarry its point.
At the meeting of the Sandstone Cut
ters' Union Jast evening at 1159 Mission
street the foilowinc officers were elected:
President, George Knignt ; vice-president,
Thomas B. Lee; hnancial secretary,
James Collier: recording secretary, James
Neifth; treasurer, John Miller; sergeant
at-arms, Alexander McKay.
The Ir nruolders' Union, at the meeting
at 11JU Mission street, took up the beer
question and decided to do all possible to
help the Brewery Workmen's Union in
its fight against the bosses. At present
but one brewery has had the courage to
place the union's label upon its beer,
thereby openly declaring iv favor of the
union's demands. Another brewery has
unionized ita. work?, but has not adopted
the label.
The ironmolders declared that as the
Bruwery Workmen's Union stood by
them in their fight, the ironmolderj will
now reciprocate by demanding that all
saloons and lunch rlace> in ttie vicinity
of the foundries and their homes snail
carry only the beer ot tne brewery using
the union's label.
In a recent report of tho suicide of John
Boyd of Third avenue tbe statement of
the Coroner's deputies wan that the man
was an ironmolder, who went through the
ironmolders' strike; also, that be killed
himself because he was out of work,
maimed ana consequently despondent.
The union indignantly deny tii.s, and
assert that Boyd was not a union man,
and that if he had been and was true to
the cause he would have been provided for
in his distress.
Carpenters' and Joiners' Union 483 met
at 915*4 Market street and elected J. C.
Hey mer president and J. McCartney vice
president io fill the places of L D. Gor
don and W. Carter, who have gone to
Manitoba.

FAMILIAR NAMES
Sometimes Are Worth Many Thousands
of Dollars.
Among manufacturers the value of a
trademark for their products is coming to
be well understood. When people get in
the way of using an article which proveÃ
meritorious and which they buy and buy
again, they soon come to know that article
by some distinct name or in connection
with some catchy line.
Some boys stood watching a painter
penceiing with his brush on a grocer's
plate-glass window the word "Postum,"
then was quickly painted the round red
disk, and one of the boys said to the
other, "It makes red blooi, that is the
health coffee ihnt boys can drins."
There was no question aboÂ»t Postum
and its trademark beine familiar to him.
When an article has become so popular
that its name is iruly n household word
and becomes a pan of everyone's vocabu-
lary, even to that of the children, the
trademark or name has become a valua-
ble franchise, which is usually protected
from confiscation by being registered in
the Patent Ollice, and some of these trade-
marks are valued at hundreds of thou-
sands of <Jo<lars, us they p.otect large busi-
ness interests irom unscrupulous persons
or firms who wou.d pirate the name if not
restrained by the strong arm of the law.
A reliable grocer will never offer a cheap
or weak imitation of a genuine original
article because he happens to make a lit-
tle extra profit. But it is well to^observe,
when genuine Postum Cereal coffee
is ordered, that you get Postum and not a
spurious imitation offered as "just as
good."

NEW YORK. N. V., March 22.âThere was a
falling oS in business at the Stock Exchange , to
day, the gales aggregating only 165,254 shares.
}irn_iness characterized the early, trading, the ab
sence of uniavoraole news from the Levant and
tbe steady absorp:ion of the Vanderbllts being the
main factors a: work. In the case of New York
Central, it was again stated that the banking syn
dicate was making progress with its scheme for
tbe refunding ol the company's indebtedness, and
on this tbe stock rose to lU2. The improvement
in the general run of active stocks was- less im
portant and ranged from 14 to 1 per cent. A sud
den break in Jersey Central from 90*4 to 88 de
stroyed the sood feeiing, however, and 1 the Im
provemetit was generally -lost. New ork (>n
tral did no, sympathize and held strong through
out. â  .
â  The decision by the United States Supreme
Court in tne Trans-Missouri Freight Association
tir-: alarming the < ousiituiio-iality of tbe Nher
man ami-trust law was another unfavorable de
ve opuien', and in the afternion the grangers were
bo. 11 in large amounts on account of this action of
the cfturt. Burlington'and Quincy, Bt> Paul and
Northwestern were especially weak in this group.
The decrease of over $477,000 in the February
earnings of the Northwestern accelerated the
downward movement In the sock. In tbe Indus
tilals riibbtr and leather were weak, sugar firm

best triendi had for the time deserted it. Prices
opened with a loss of from Vi to r. 8 ceut, und the
course for some time thereafter was rapidly and
uninterruptedly downward. The influence which
started the break came from Liverpool and Paris

than was figured on on Sa urday and more favor

STUCK IN THE MAIL TUBE.
Pneumatic Transit Obstructed by Â»
Brass Letter- Carrier.
In shooting tbc mail through the under
ground pneumatic tube between the Post
ortice and the Bourse a couple oi days ago
a or&ss carrier full of letters stuck fast
midway on its route. One or two others
piled up against it and formed an obstruc
tion which could not be dislodged by any
air current forced in. The tuoe was ren
dered temporarily useless by the accident
and is still so, for the carriers nave not yet
been removed.
Owing to the inaccessibility of the long
metal tube under the streets the task of
iinding the troublesome carriers is no easy
one. It is believed, however, that by
using an ingenious French device, es
pecially adapted for this emergency by
Engineer Arthur Falfcenan of this city,
tne difficulty may be speedily overcome
and a path cleared for resumption of pneu
matic mail transit. The object is to locate
the obstruction exactly, and then, by dig
ging from above, it can be taxen out by
cutting the tube.
The device was put in operation at the
Bourse end of the system yesterday, and
there is every indication that the result
will be satisfactory. It consisted oi firing
a pistol into the end of the tube and ac
curately recording the time that elapsed
until the echo of the shot came back. '
The sounii traveled along the tube at its
known rate of 1100 feet a second, and,
meeting the obstruction, was echoed back
to the orifice in just 2 91 second after the
first report. From this it was calculated
that the sound went about 3200 feet, or
IGOO feet each way. The latter distance
was decided upon as that between the ob
struction and the station at the Bourse.
This fixed it at a point along the line be
tween Sixth and Seventh streets, where
the workmen are directed to dig. The
time consume! by the sound in its jour
ney through the tube was measured by
the vibrations of arubberdiaphgram, elec
trically connected with a chronograph. â

Only about two minutes are required for

thence to the lungs, back to the heart,
and then through the entire body, and re
turn to the heart.

A Little French Woman in East
Oakland Attributes It b
. Her Enemies.
There Is Also a Suspicion That She
Is Sibj ct to a Very Peculiar
Mania
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broaaway, March 22. t
. Mrs. Dolman, a little French woman liv
ing at 67 East Twelfth street, told a story
to-day of most cruel persecution. Misfor
tune having overtaken her she set out to
earn her own living Dy raising ducks and
chickens, and has done very well until
some enemies started to make her life
miserable and deprive her of her means of
livelihood.
Several weeks ago Mrs. Dolman's ducks
and chickens began to disappear. Every
morning when she awoke she found some
new torsure that had been perpetrated on
. her birds. Home Kere choked to death
Wand others were killed in the most merci-
W .ess manner. One mode of torture was to
"run a darning needle through the eyes of
the tirus. Some of the ducks had their
eyes gouged out. More recently many
birds have been killed by piercing the
bodies with a needle dipped into deadly
acid. The list of birds killed grew day by
day until two hundred squabs, ducks and
chickens were dead.
Not content with torturing the birds
the miscreants threw acid on her cat,
burning off the fur and sKin of a large por
tion of her body. This was kept up till the
little woman is nearly crazy, and she has
been unable to defend herself or discover
hor persecutor.
"1 have my suspicions of the people
â who are doing these diabolical things,"
she said, "but I cannot prove tnem. I
now watch every night, and if I see any
one moving around my erounds I shall
shoot. lam alone in the world and must
protect myself and property. I have gone
to the police and tbty have done nothing
for me. I have been living here for about
Jour months, and during the past six
weeke this persecution bas been going on.
I cannot say who does it, but 1 will say
that a certain man was insulting to me,
and said that he would make this place
too uncomfortable for me to stay."
Intberycrd this morning Mrs. Dolman
showed a small keg filled with dead
squabs, some of them horribly mutilated.
fciie aa.d the keg contained the birds
killed during the past three days.
The neighbors declare the French
woman to be j>.n industrious person who
gives no cffense to any o"e. It was be
lieved for a time that she is insane and
that her mania takes the form of a aesire
to tor:ure animals, buttnoie who see niojt
of her do not take any stock in the theory,
and declare that she is the v:ctim of per
eecution.
THE LIBRARY BILL.
Anxiety Felt as to Whether the Gov
ernor Will Approve It or Notâ Effect
on the Coming Election.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 22â About
the only p ccc of "unfinished legislation"
in which Aiameda takes much interest is
the bill making the office of Library
Trustee eidciive. This was passed and is
now in the hands of the Governor awaiting
his signature or disapproval as he may
eiect. The matter of drafting the proc
lamation for the coming city e.ection will
come ud before the Board of City Trustees
this evening and the question will be
whether they shall include the five Li
brary Trustees provided by the new law^
in the call. Candidates have been nomi
nated by the different organizations in
tne expectation that the bill would be
come a law. It is not. known that the
â Governor has any objections to the meas
ure, but there is no wav of for -telling his
action, and there is an idea afloat that if
the names of the Trustees are put in the
proclamation and on the ticket and the
Governor should thereafter refusi to ap
prove the bill, the validity of thj election
might be endangered. In view of these
facts those interested in tbe matter are
anxiously awaiting news from Sacra
ruento.

The Street Committee.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 22.â The
Street Committee ot the City Trustees re
ported to-night in favor of extending the
northiide and Blanding-avenue sewers
300 feet to deep water. The cost would
be about $690, and the idea is for tbe city
to furnish toe material and pay the fore
man, using for workmen the laborers who
are at this time employed in cleaning up
the streets. Resolutions were passed for
the improvement of Sherman and Cbapin
streets plans and specifications having
b>en presented. The City Clerk was in
structed to secure the necessary supplies
for the coming election. A resolution
was adoDted for tne holding of the elec
tion for' city officers, including the five
trustees of the Free Library, although tbe
b-il making this office elective is yet in
the bands of tbe Governor without tction
having been taken thereon. The liquor
traffic- question was also ordered placed
dn the ballot by the ordinance.

To the Directors of the Oakland Board of Tradeâ
Gentlemen: Your committee on parks is ior
various reasons as yet unable to report decis
ively concerning the projector acquirement
of a. large park, in the suburbs of the city, but
hopes to be able at a later date to accomplish
all that can reasonably be desired orexpected.
In consideration of the subject in its varied
aspects we have, however, concluded to make
favorable recommendation of what may very
properly be deemed a branch of the same sub
ject, or cÂ»osely ai iied to it.
There are about twenty acres of tide and
overflowed land in the north arm of the estu
ary lying between Eighth-street bridge and
Twelfth-street dam. Ims parcel is a portion
of the water-front property, the ownership of
which is in litigation between the city of
Oakland and the Oakland Water-front Corn-
pa ny.
The board of engineers in charge of the
harbor construction, considering the equities
of the matter 'and the apparent necessity of
closer and more frequent communication be
tween East Oakland and the central part of
the city, have established as their bulkhead
line the south line of Eighth street extending
easterly to the easterly shore, thus surrender
ing the control of all lying northerly of Eaid
line of Eighth street, ana permitting it to be
rilled in.
We therefore call attention to the many de
sirable ends that would be accomplished by
the filing in and reclamation of ttii- tide land.
The economical dredging of Lake Merritt.
The tilling of th â¢ Eighth-street bridge, saving
the coil of construction, th;: relieving of the
pressure of travel on Eighth and Twelfth
streets by the opening uj> of other avenues.
The con-tructlon of a park, which would re
move the unsightly mudflats, formal dedica
tion being made for park purioses, and a plan
being adopted now lor improvement of name,
to be carried out as fast as tunds would per
mit.
We therefore recommend that the project be
approved by your board ana the parit com
mittee be Instructed to inteiview :he Oakland
Water-front Company to ascertain if they will
reiinquisn their cairn to said tide lands. Re
spectiuily submitted. Park committee.

Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 22. J
The inevitable has come to pass and the
pent-up aneer of certain members of the
Board of Supervisors hat broken loose.
But for tbe absence of gloves and the
presence of cloUiintr, the Supervisors'
chamber tbis morning might easily have
been mistaken for a siaeshow to the great
even at Carson last week. The Council
chamber has been the scene of some
heated debate, the rules for governing
which are not found in Cushing's Manual,
bnt never has the lobby of the City Hall
witnessed such a lively three minutes an
were seen at :he Hall of Records to-day.
When the new members of the Board of
Supervisors took office, in January, Mr.
Roeth was in position to dictate. Ho had
with him two members of the board ana
controlled everythine. Before tho new
hoard was a month old its complexion
changed and Mr. Roeth was a lonely mi
nority. He blamed Supervisor Church
with being the cause of his predicament,
and since that time the two gentlemen
have been ready to fall out at a moment's
notice. Last week Mr. Roeth save an in
terview reflecting forcibly on Mr. Church.
Church refused to discuss the matter in
the papers, but was prepared to fight his
battle when toe board met this morning.
No time was lost, and while discussing a
requisition regarding the County Infirm
ary, Church rose to a point Of personal
privilege. He said: "There was a com
munication published the other morning
from Mr. Koeth. Ue did not have the
courage to sign it, but it was of such a
nature that it demands refutation. I am
plenty able to take care of myself person
ally, but when it comes 10 attacking me
in niy official capacity, I will not let the
matter pass. 1 brand Mr. lloeth's state
ment as a lie which he can't substan
tiate."
Mr. Church then turned toward Mr.
Roetb, and with violent rage he thumped
his desk and cried out: "I brand that
statement as a lie, and the man that made
it don't know wbat he is talking about. I
have figures here to prove this, ana here
they are."
Mr. Church then handed the clerk a re
port from the city expert which showed
conclusively thai Mr. Koeth bad been mis
taken in bis published statement. After
it bad been read Cburcb resumed:
"I have produced my figures and I now
defy Mr. Koeth to produce his." As be
said this Church's list was dangerously
near Mr. Roeth's face.
Koeth shouted, "Whom are you talking
about, the Examiner or me?"
"I say this, sir; the Examiner was mis
informed, and you lied."
Both Supervisors jumped to their feet
and faced each other, but as nobody called
time, and they did not hear a gong, each
retired to bis corner, or more properly,
sat down in bis seat.
Roeta demanded that the charges and
language of Mr. Church be placed on the
minuses, and after he declined to be ques
tioned, Church again gave him the lie
direct, and there was more confusion.
Supervisor Wells made a motion that
the board take a recess for fifteen minutes,
, and Cnairman Talcott immediately de
clared it without taking a vote.
The incident in the boardroom does not
explain the cause of the feeling between
the two men. It dates back to the time
prior to election, and may yet end in some
sensational exposures.
Before tbÂ« election friends of Assessor
Dalton went around to ibe candidates for
Supervisor and tried to get their signa
tures to a parer binding them to support
the assessments of Assessor Dalton if
elected, i his paper, it il said, was signed
by Weils and Koeih. Mitchell would not
sis;i] it, and Church does not approve of
any man who sits on the Board of Equal
ization, as do the Supervisors, tying bim
eelf up beforehand. When the Board of
Equalization meets an attempt will prob
ably be made to show that Wells and
Roc tu are incompetent to sit. Should
such be the caÂ«e there will be a complica
tion at the Hull ot Records worse than has
existed for many year^.
For Lack of Courteouinen.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 22.â Deputy
County Cierk A. L. Perkins of Alameda,
appointed for registration purposes only,
was removed to-day by County Clerk
Jordan, on complaint of County Clerk
Witcher of San Luis Obispo County. Mr.
Jordan is a rum believer in Chesterfield
politeness and instruct* every deputy, no
matter now exacting the ciutomer, to
treat them with the respect due their su
perior?. Mr. Perkins wrote a letter to
Clerk Witcher, who at once returned it to
Mr. Jordan, and as a consequence the ap
pointment was at once revoked.
I! rein Failed to Answer.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 22.â Peter
Borein, the ex-County Clerk and Re
corder, did not put in an appearance in
court tnis morning wben his wife's suit
for a divorce was called for trial. Mr?.
Borein tesiiried that her husband's for
tune had disappeared. Tiie home was
mortgaged a short time ago, and $1900 of
the money so obtained was in the hands
of her husband's uncle. She was allowed
$40 a month from this for her support
pending the result of the present action
For a divorce.
Contested by Forty.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 22.â V. P.
Mitchell to-day stated that he was one of
the contestants over the result of the re
cent election of Mr. Thomas, but that
there are thirty-nine others interested in
the contest. "It is this way," said Mr.
Mitchell. "Forty of us put up $10 each to
nay the expense. I made a waster of.
$lUOO and it became generally Known.
Every one came to me to make a contest ;
so with their aid we have had papers
drawn and they are now ready for filing,
if not already filed."
ALL READY TO RUSH.
Freshmen and Sophomores Pre
pared for Their Annual
Contest.
They Will Mset oa the Hills Back
of tha Campus anl Three Hundred
Men Will Fight-
BERKELEY, Cal., March 22.â While
the solemn exercises attending the cele
bration of Charter day at the State Uni
versity to-morrow morning are going on,
the freshmen and sophomores will lock
horns in their last, "rush" before the
burial of Bourdon and Minto, which oc
curs early in May. They have chosen a
point of vantage on the western slope of
the hill- back of the University reserva
tion as the scene of their combat.
According to the custom the freshmen
have taken the initiative, and to-night a
party of about fifty of them went up the
hillside and marked out in huge letters
their "00." Thsy will remain all night
in defense of their year number. In t c
morning the "sophs," under President
Donnell, will muster their forces and at
tempt an overthrow of the freshmen an
erasure of their lettering and the substitu*
lion of the figures "99." It is anticipated
that not less than 300 men will line up in
battle array.
Dr. Ketcham Resigns.
BERKELEY, Cal.. March 22.â Key. Dr.
H. A. Ketchum offered bis resignation as
pastor of the First Presbyterian Church
yesterday morning at the regular service.
He has been pastor for the last six years,
and durin? his time a fine new edifice has
been erected and 200 members added to
the list. For several weeks he has bean
considering the matter of resigning, and
yesterday he formally announced his pur
pose of withdrawing, stating that he
would preach his farewell sermon on
June 6. It has been the current gossip
that Dr. Ketchum has lived out his period
of usefulness in Berkeley and that the
congregation desire a younger and more
active roan for the place. It is understooi
that his intention of leaving is the out
growth of the meeting of the session a
short time ago.
His resignation has not yet been ac
cepted, nor has the church a new pastor
tn view.
Music Contest Abandoned.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 22.â The m
tercoilegiaie music contest, which was to
have been held between the Berkeley and
Stanford glee mandolin and banjo clubs at
the carnival of the Golden Gate, has been
abandoned on account of the liitiii v ty in
arriving at a decision as to bow and on
what basis the judging should be con
ducted. Instead of a contest there will
be substituted a combination concert in
San Francl-co in the near future.
Practice for the concert will continue
just as vigorous!** as if the performers
were to face an official body of judges, so
that the concert will be practically a con
test for honors, W'thoui the judges.
Berkeley will put thirty-five men on the
stage, some of whom will take part in the
glee, as well as the banjo and mandolin
clubs.

In Two Months There Will Be

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
108 Broadway, March 22. f
It is more man likely that the commis
sion merchants of Oakland may organize
a ateamship Jine brtween Sacramento
River points and Oaeland. A conference
was held this morning between those in
terested regarding the establishment of
direct communication between Oakland
and the lruit and produce producing coun
try without the medium of San Francisco.
In the past the great difficulty with
local canneries has been the absence of fa
cilities for quickly handling the necessary
fruit. It is computed that not iesi than
seven people are necessary to handle the
consignments from the time they leave
the orchard till they arrive at the cannery.
Tnis of course adds greatly to the expense
and helps to destroy the value of the fruit.
It was stated this mornine that in two
month's time shipments will begin to be
so Inrge that one medium-sized boat will
be necessary each day to suppiy this city
with produce and the canneries with fruit.
The point now being discussed is who
shall supply the steamers. Two San Fran
cisco lines have the matter under consid
eration, but their boats are considered too
large for the Oakland trade exclusively,
and if they have to make a call at San
Fiancisco the present conditions will not
be materially improved. Under these cir
cumstances the commission men will
probably organize and purchase or charter
a. couple of boats over which they will
have exclusive control.
E'ison Adams, manager of the new
wharves, said to-day that they are ready
to handle all this produce as soon as the
commission men make up their minds
what they want.
"The question of boats is now the only
tbing in the way At removing Oakland s
commission business to the water front
and transacting it independent of San
Francisco," said Mr. Adams to-day. "We
are prepared to attend to all the necessary
tracks and warehouses just as so^n as they
shall be needed. But we are not disposed,
of course, to enter into the steamship
business. We are interested in building
and developing all necessary wharfage,
but do not desire to compete with bteam
boai companies. There are at present but
two canneries in Oakland, but there would
be more if a cheap and speedy line of
steamers brought the fruit direct to this
city. This is a point which should not be
overlooked. The harbor will be com
pleted in a few years and with ita comple
tion there will be other developments and
the commission men would not be making
a mistake by carrying out at once the plan
they hare under consideration. In no
other city of its size in the world is there
such a lack of transportation facilities as
there is from Oakland by means of water.
From this city at this time there is not n si n
g.e ii ue of boats to any plr.ee but San Fran
cisco. It is surnly time with our deep
water harbor that we had. some independ
ent communication."
School Children to Aid.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 22. -Mrs. Al
exander Campbell and Miss Sophie New
lands are preparing to appeal to the school
children of ibis city to assist the worthy
poor of San Francisco. Their plans, so
far as outlined, are to canvass the schools
and ask all who are willing to bring a
lunch for one man. In this way it is as
serted that the whole 1800 unemployed
nniy be given one meal with a very little
outlay by any one person.
"It is true Oakland has its unemployed,
but there are not so many of them, nor
has their condition ben reduced to such
extreme distress," said Miss Nowlands to
day. "You know, the same plan was
worked successfully here three years ago.
We could go around and tell the children
the need, .and whatever was donated we
could readily arrange to baye taken to
San Fiancisco."
No Salt Combination.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 22.â Another
effort has been made, and failed, to com
bine the producers of sea salt in this
county. Light years ago a combination
of the Union Pacific, the American, the
Carmen Island and the Pioneer salt com
panies was made, and for five years the
price was regulated and all smaller con
cerns taken under a leas?. Then a part
of them were dropped out, but these
began the cutting ot prices, which eventu
ally dis'upiod the concern, bevera, at
tempts have been made since to get con
trol of the output, but each has met with
failure.
At the Old Stand.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 22.â St. John's
Episcopal Church is to be rebuilt upon
the old site. The Seventh-street frontage,
100x150 feet, will be sold and a high board
fence erected to cut off as much of the
noise as possible. Thu new edifice will be
erected on the Eighth-street side, and the
insurance money, together with the $4500
for the Seventh-street front uee, wilt pay
for the building. Several sites were dis
cussed, but the v siry finally decided to
stand by the present site.
Drowned in Stony Brook.
OAKLAND, Cal, March 22.â Clarence
Noutcher, a young son of Mr. and Mrs J.
H. Noutcher, living near Sunol. fell into
Stony Brook yesterday morning and died
shortly afterward. He was running
along ahead of his mother, but approached
too near the bank, which gave way. dash
ing the youngster headforemost into the
water. He apparently struck his head on
a stone, which is supposed to have caused
his death.
Say* She Was Hypnotised.
OAKLAND, Cal-, March 22.â Mrs. May
McCul tough declares hat the alleged
confession which her husband claims to
hold was secured while she was hyp
notized. She will push her suit for sepa- ,
ration, and quite a sensation is expected
when it comes to trial.

"Merry Wives of Wind
sor" a Hit at the
Tivoli.
"The Strategists," at the Alca
zar, Suited to tbe
Company.
Good Houses and Gocd B 11s at th;
Grand and Orpbenm â "Gis
monda's" Second Week-
Preparations have been eoing on for a
long time at the Tiyoli for Nicolai's
"Merry Wives of Windsor," which was
rerived last night with considerable suc
cess. It is over five years since the opera
was played here, though tne overture has
been a favorite with several local con
ductors, particularly with .fritz Schee'.
The overture last night was so well
played by Carl Martens' orchestra tnat
the audience insisted on hearing it again.
When the curtain finally went up and
revealed Laura Millard as Mistress Ford
there was another demonstration on the
part of the audience, for Miss Millard be
came a favorite at the Tivoli during her
last engagement, and this is her tint re
appearance.
All through the work Nicolai's bright,
tuneful score was well rendered both by
the vocolists and the orchestra. Miss Mil
lard, whose voice has gained somewhat in
power, was a merry, coquettish Mistress
Ford and Bernice Holmes sang pleasingly
as Mistress PaÂ«e, though she might have
been more dashing in â¢er acting. Elvia
Crox Seabrook- looked charming as Anne
Pace and entered con am. .re into the
spirit of the role, while Josie Intropidi
made a good Mistress Quickly.
William H. West was intrusted with
the role of Sir John Falstaff, and a royster
ine, swaggering knight he made. There
was an occasional disposition to be
slightly uncertain as to the pitch in his
singing, but this was so slight as to be
scarcely noticeable. Otherwise West sang
Falstaff s lines in capital style, and he
looked the part to perfection.
John J. Raffael acted and sang excel*
lently as the jealous Master Ford, and
William H. Tooker was a good Master
Pace. Murcel Perron played the role of
Dr. Caius, the fare-eating French lover, in
a way that won him hearty applause, and
Kbys Thomas sang well as Fen ton, the
poor but favored lover.
The chorus did good work, particularly
in the tinale of the first act, which was en
cored, and the opera was well staged and
costumed. The ballet of elves, gnats,
fireflies, etc., in the last act, was a pretty
spectacular dit-play.
Baldwin Theater.
Fanny Davenport's spectacular produotion
of "Glsmonda" promises to have a prosperous
second week at the Baldwin. No finer piece
of staging has ever been seen in this city, and
tbe audience shows its appreciation by the
applause it gives each of the picturesque
sceues.
The Alcazar.
Judging by "The Strategists," produced at
the Alcazar last evening, a decade makes but
little change in the ways and arts of the
farce-comedy author. Dr. Theodore Sayre
made use in the construction of his '-Sirate
gists" of the same complications the French
writers utilize to-day; only they condense
their farcical eutanglements in three acts in
stead of the four acts of some ten years ago.
Given a chorus, pretty girls in abbreviated
skirts and big hats, and "The Strategists"
would rival, if not excel, any of Hoyt's later
day productions.
'â¢Tne Strategists" is a comedy with a plot.
The fun is bright and clean, and there are

Columbia Theater.
Cissy Fitzgerald enlivened the performance
of "The Foundling" last night by introducing
the dance which is said to have won her the
affections of the New York chappies. It is
known as the "hoop-skirt dance," and has to
be performed between the acts, for the
simple reason that Cissy and her hoop
skirts are too voluminous to admit of
anything, animated or lnanlmated. being on
the stage simultaneously with them. The
hoop-skirt dance is even more sensational
than Cissy's exhibition of garters a;.d pink
bows, and it captured the taste of the audi
ence so completely that she was recalled three
times.
"The Huguenots" is the bill at the Califarnia
Theater for to-night.
The idea of tendering a benefit to Henri
Albers is taking definite shape, and the proba
bility is that tne bill for the occasion will be
Ambroise Thomas' "Hamlet," which has never
been performed in this City.
At the Orpheum.
Quite a number of "stars" opened at the
Orpheum last ni^nt, but the brightest one of
the lot, Henry Lee. failed to find an apprecia
tive audience. Why it is hard to tell, for he
gave an excellent performance and his imper
sonations were wonderfully clever and true to
life. Tnoy did not meet the success they
merited.
The three Vilona sisters, "musical artists,"
payed a choice selection of musical gems,
cheenully mixing "Ma Angeline" with "Cav
alleria Rusticaua" and smiling through it allâ
and so did the audience. Jon tiny and Emma
Ray were cheered to the echo. The rest of the
bill was fairly good.
At the Grand.
Last night "The Great Northwest" held the
boards at the Grand. It contained the usual
number of villains, heroes and heroines, with
a very liberal amount of comedy scattered
all through the play. There were some of the
beautiful scenic effects for which the Grand
is so noted, the most effective being a realistic
fire see-ie where fields of wheat are destroyed
by a prairie fire.
Miss Atwood being still unable to appear
Miss Anna Daly is playing her parts. She is a
clever girl and deserves tne success she is win
ning. Irma Fitch, who is specially engaged
f ir this play, sang and danced her way into
high javor. By come mistake Mr. Fairbanks'
name is down for the part played by Bert Mor
rison. Morrison has a talent for c< medy char
acter work and should stick to it. Mor'.imer
Snow, Nat Willis and Julia Blanc came in for
tneir usual snare of approoation.
At the Chutes.
The pleasant weather is thoroughly appre
ciated by the patrons of the Chutes, and the
Haight-street grounds are being well patron
ized. The bill on the open-air stage, given
every aiternoon and evening, includes the
Joshinato troupe of Japanese acrobats; the
Liwrence sisters, contortion dancers; the
Marco brothers, comedy acrobats and the
Animatoscope, which shows new pictures
every nigat.
SUICIDE OF F. A. WHEELER
The Tea Expert Ended His Life
by lo baling Ccal
Gas.
Frederick A. Wheeler, a tea expert and
importer living at 1812 Steiner street, was
found deed in his room early yesterday
morning under circumstances that lead to
the belief that it was a case of suicide by
gas.
He bad a room in the house of Police
Corporal J. S. Adums, who, upon arising,
detected the oaor of gas. He brose into
the room and found Wheeler's dead body
in the bed. Both gascocks were wide onen.
An examination of the dead man's prop
erty showed that he was without any
money. From all that could be learned
Wheeler has been in hard luck for some
time past He formerly looked alter the
local business of several Oriental tea mer
chants, out the business declined and the
agencies were taken away from him.
Later he was employed by Foker & Co.,
and still later he engai-ed in the broker
age business and his office was at 114 Cali
fornia street. This did not appear to pay
well, and it was concluded that despond
ency, in consequence of lailure in business
and protracted illness, had much to do
with his death.
Back of all this there was a romance
that seems to have added to his depres
sion. It was stated that Wheeler was
engaged to Mrs. L. Mowry and that their
engagement was of lo:ig standing. In
his safe a will was found dated on Novem
ber 16, 1896. By this instrument Wheeler
bequea bed all of his personal property
and effects, besides his office furniture, to
Mrs. Mowry. His property consisted in
the main of his watch and chain, dia
mond rine and three racehorses at Lake
ville and a buggy in this City. It is said
that Wheeler lost considerable money on
these horses on the racetracks, for noneol
his animals ever made big winnings for
him.
In his will, which was witnessed by J.
Roos, Wheeler staled that he hoped that
these sifts would in a measure repay
Mrs. Mowry for her many acts of kind
ness to him during hi* nanv illnesses.
He further stated that M--?. Mowry knows
how he wanted some few thihes disposed
of and he made her the ex.cutr.xof his
will without bonds.

FATHER MARASCHI'S WILL
He Might Have Been Worth
Millions by Real Estate
Investment.
Al! His Properly Bequeathed to Rev.
Jjsepi Sasia and Rev.
Aly-ius Varsi.
The w.ll of the venerable Father An
thony Maraschi, S. J., was filed for pro
bate yesterday. The estate of the de
ceased consists of real estate, one lot on
McAllister street in this City valued at
$12,500, a lot on Stiver street worth $2500
anil land in Contra Costa County, being a
part of San Pablo rancho, the value cf
which is unknown.
The will is presented for probate by
Father Aloysius Varsi, who states that
Father Joseph Sasia, the other person
named as executor, has been absent from
the State for two years and is now at Tu
rin, Italy.
Following is the full text of the instru
ment:
In the name of God, amen. I, Anthony Ma
raschi, of the City and County of San Fran
cisco and State of California, being of sound
mind and memory and understanding, do
make, publish and declare this to be my lsst
will and testament, hereby revoking any ana
nil former wills by me made.
I nominate, constitute and appoint Rev. Jo
seph basia and R>v. Aloyslus Varsi, both of
the City and County of Pan Francisco, State of
California, executors of this, my will, and
specially waive their piving bonds or security
of any kind for the irusts reposed in them.
Either may act as executor if the other will
not or cannot act as sue::.
I give, devise and bequeath to my said ex
ecutors all my estate, real, personal and mixed
of every name, nature and description, and
wheresoever me same is situate. In case
either of my said executors be dead before my
own death, I give, devise and bequeath all my
said estate io the surviv.f of the two, so that
nothinc should go to the heirs of the deceased.
I do declare that I have no wife and leave no
js-sue, aud that witn full knowledge and de
liberation 1 give and bequeath nothing to my
relatives.
I authorize and empower my said executors
or executor to sell the whole or any pan of my
real estate at public or private sale lor cash or
op credit, as they or he may deem advisable,
and without any order of sale from any court
for such purpose and without any order of
Confirmation of any such sale from any court.
' In witness whereof I have hereunto set my
hand and seal this 25th day of April. 1884.
A. Maraschi, S. J.
.The instrument is entirely in the hand
writing of the testator, and is witnessed
by John M. Burnett and David I. Maho-
ney.
In early days Father Maraschi bought
large tracts of real estate in this City, the
greater part of his purchases beins for the
benefit of the church wliich he repre-
Eented. It was noticed that he generally
gave preierenc? to property at U.at time
considered beyond the limits of the prob
able growth of tne City. The soundness
of his ju igment was demonstrated by the
fact that lots and blocks for wnich he paid
hundreds of dollars may now be Â«o d for
millions. If he had chosen to invest for
him self, instead of on behalf of his ctiurcb,
lie might have been one of the wealthiest
men of :he City or State. In comparison
with those holdings the Blythe block
would have br en as a droc in the bucket.
Ttie will of Pillsbury HodÃkina has been
filed for probate; al-o the wills of John
Renz and Mrs. Ehzibe;h Kerr.

ALL APPLAUD THE MOVE FOR THE NEW CONSTITUTION
The Present Fundamental Law of the State Is Held by Lawyers and Business
Men to Be Responsible for Nearly All the Ills the
State Is Heir To.
Julian Socntag Says It Turns Millions of Money From the State and Keeps Immigrants Away.
Henry N. Clement Says It Is the Work of Sandlotters and in Taxing Too Much Instead
of Exempting a Little It Has Worked Hardships to All.
The resolution looking to the calling of
a constitutional convention to reconstruct
the fundamental law of this State, which
was adopted by the Legislature as one of
its last and most deliberate acts, finds
much favor with all classes of people. In
terviews with prominent men, especially
the progressive men of affairs in the City,
develop scarcely any opposition. Such
expressions of opinion as were directed
against the measure were based not on
the ground that the present constitution
is satisfactory, but upon the fear that the
convention may be controlled by politi
cians, and that not a better but a wor3e in
strument be drawn. As against these few
doubters, however, the large majority of
those interviewed declared, simply, that
in face of such danger the business men
and workingmen â the representatives of
the best interests of the Stateâ must go on
guard; must meet and defeat it, and must
begin to prepare now for building the best
and most; modern constitution to take the
place of t. c "worst and most medieval,"
as more than one of these characterized
that of California.
Among those who are particularly
pleased with the prospect of a modern
constitution for California are the active
members of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association.
Julian. Sonntag, president of the asso
cia'ion, baid yesterday: "Our constitu
tion fixes upon the State the worst system
of taxation that could be invented. It
could not have been better devised if the
intention had been to cripple our indus
tries. I know that this system is respon
sible for driving millions of capital out of
the State or preventing its coming here.
There is no question in my mind that this
is responsible in a great measure for the
flight eastward of the men who have ac
cumulated wealth here. In almost every
instance they have quietly sOiidined their
interests and gone away.
"The constitution was put together hast
ily and has not only this mibht taxation
system but very many defects. From
these defects San Francisco has suf
fered particularly â suffered irreparabe
loss. Oue instance of this we witness
yearly in the workings 01 the State Board
of Equalization. Our whole iridustrial
system has changed within the past twenty
years. We have entered upon new con
ditions; we have come in o closer relation
ship with the East: our methods have
changed ; our interests revolutionized, and
to we have got to have laws to nccommo
date these changed conditions and to get
the laws we have a constitution that does
not forbid them. Twenty years ago there
did not exist the large industrial and com
mercial organizations that now have a |
comprehensive grasp and an outlook over
the whole world.
"These organizations must now get to- I

The Cousin of the Prince Had

Came Back to San Francisco on the
Vessel and Then Suddenly
Disappeared.
The British ship Lismore is getting
more than her share of honor and glory.
The first load of redwood that will go up
the Clyde to Glasgow will go away from
here on her, and on her last voyage a
cousin of Prince Poniatowski served before
the mast and made three tables that the
captain has now aboard as souvenirÃ. He
would not sell them for any money, but if
the Prince wants a specimen of his cousin's
handiwork he can get it by applying to
Captain Ferguson, on board the British
ship Lismore.
Captain Ferguson's strange experience
began in Portland, Or. Sailors were very
scarce at the time and biood money was
plentiful. When the vessel was in the
effing the mate went to Captain Ferguson
and complained that one of the crew was
no sailor and asked to have the vessel put
about and a man secured in his place. The
sailor came aft and complained that be
had been shanghaied and Demanded his
liDerty. The vessel was under way, how
ever, ; and as time and tide wait for no
man, the unfortunate landsman was car
;;â â <! to sea.
When the Lismore was well out to sea
Captain Ferguson sent for the man and
found that he was a second cousin of
Prince Poniatowski, and tliat after leavini;

the slums and was drugged. The next
thing he knew was when he awoke at sea

gether and go systematically to work
toward correcting the fundamental laws
of the State. They will be prepared to
point out the defects as well as the rrood
points of our constitution. There may he
Â»ome good points, but there are many bad
one-. It is full of harmful legislation
that has no business in such an instru
ment. That is an evil the public will de
mand to be remedied. Then, too, the
civil service is a necessity of the time
that should bo inaugurated by a new con
s'it ut ion, so that every few years we would
not be compelled to undergo the bard
ship of a political campaign where men
are looking for nothing but spoils. I at
tribute the comparative lack of immigra
tion to the bad laws of the State.
"With a modern constitution for the
State and a charter for this City evolved
from modern progressive ideas, San Fran
cisco would go forward with a speed for
which there is nothing in its past to make
corn par. sons. These two things would be
a legacy of lasting beneiii to be ieft by
this to all future irenerations. I, for one,
am ready to take my chances for a new
constitution."
Harry N. Ciement is equally enthu
siastic over the prospects. "I saw with
surprise The Call's st> ry of how ihe reso
lution ior the new constitutional conven
tion went through. Well, however it
happened, it was the best and wisest thing
they did in the whole session. The pres
ent constitution was the result of the sand
lot agitation â practically the work of the
sandlotters â and is the very worst in the
world, it is not a fundamental law ; it is
a hodgepodge of vicious legislation. It so
binds and hampers the law-making power
that there is scarcely a possibility of mak
ing a good law that is constitutional.
"For instance take section 8 in refer
ance to municipal charters. It was
amended April 12, 1887, and the amend
ment was worse than the original. Then
they amended it again in 1892 without re
lieving the trouble. That section was re
sponsible in agreat measure for the defeat
of our new charter. The people will not
have a charter that cannot be amended.
"I think the people are fully aroused now
to the disadvantage of our constitution.
They have tested it and suffered under it
for seventeen years now and are thor
oughly ripe lor "a fundamental Jaw, which
this is not It contains the worst system
of taxation that was ever devised. As I
said it was the work of the sandlotters.
They were so bent on cinching the rich
that they have instead spoiled enterprise
and brought harm to the poor. Instead
of exempting a lot of things for their
own benefit and simplifying the tax sys
tem â taxijg tangib.es â they involved and
complicated it, loaded taxes on charters,
franchises and all sorts of intangible
things that cannot be taxed. In so doing
they drove capital out of the State and
brought ruin upon tne poor. No moneyed
man will ever come to California to invest
and found himself in the dress of a sailor.
"I had no means of tilling whether he
was a sailor or not, and neither could I
tell whether hio story was straight or not,"
said Captain Ferguson yesterday. ''He
had the bearing of a gentleman and his
hand 3 looked as though he had never
done any hard work. As I had paid an
advance for him I had to get some work
for his pay, so I put him at the carpen
ter's bench.
"One day I had him removing some Dar
titions in the after-cabin and I was lying
on one of the settees reading. Suddenly
Poniatowski turned to me and said : 'Cap
tain, I can tell what you are thinking
about.' I was about to order him out of
the cabin when he said a<rain: 'Don't
think I'm crazy; I assure you lam speak
ing the truth.'
"I looked at the man for a minute and
then asked brusquely. 'Well, what was I
thinking about?' 'You were thinking
how much more comfortable it would be
to have a table near that lounge on which
to put your lig t, your bookÃ, your chart
and your pipe, and I can make you one.'
"The man was correct in every detail
and I was dumfounded," continued Cap
tain Ferguson. 'When I recovered from
my surprise I told him to go ahead and
make the tables, and there they are. He
made three of them, and you can see for
yourself that they are well finished. On
our arrival in San Francisco last Decem
ber Poniatowski disappeared and I nave
never seen or heard from him since."
The tables in question are handsome af
fairs. The tops are trom the oak paneling
of the partition wall of the after cabin and
the legs are of Oregon pine, very beauti
fully carved. One thing Captain Fergu
son is sure of, and that is, that whatever
has become of the shanghaied sailor he
gave Portland a wide berth on his wav to
the Ka-t.
The Lismore is loading in the stream,
and took the first part of her cargo from
the steam schooner Weeott yesterday.
Some very handsome redwood is going
into the hold, and Captain Ferguson says
if he can .-.care up anott er cousin to a
Prince, even if he be shanghaied, he will
have some more tables made.

while we allow this tax system to live."
Horace G. Platt, attorney, was one of
the doubters. He said if he had been in
the Legislature he would have voted
against the measure for these reasons:
"I think the times are too hard. It is a
bad scheme to undertake to change the
fundamental law at this time. See how
the conventions of the two great parties
ran to free silver. The Republicans had
to take that back. ThÂ» constitution is
good enoug .. There are some things in it
that might b" better, to be sure, but others
thai might be a good deal worse. The
times are out of joint now, and
I think we should prefer the ills we
have rather than fly to others that
we know not of. Every fellow that
has a sciierae for the betterment
of mankind would be up in that conven
tion with that scheme. And if the poli
ticians get hold of it there ia. no telling
where we would land. Until this matter
is settled capital will be wary how it seeks
investment here.
"No, I would have opposed the resolu
tion had I been in the Legislature."
Joseph Leggett, lawyer, sees much to
gladden his heart in the molding of a
modern constitution.
"The Governor does not have to sign
the resolution submitting this matter to
the people," be said. "Therefore it is
now a law. It must be voted upon some
time before the next sitting of the Legio
lature. and if it carries taen the Legisla
ture must make provision for the holding
of the convention. The convention must
meet and conclude its business within
one year thereafter, so that three years
will elapse before the new constitution â
which lam sure will be ordered by the
people â can go into effect.
"That I am heartily in favor of it goes
without saying. If the thought of the
time ripens as rapidly in those thre* years
as it has in the past three the delegate!
elected to that convention will know how
to write the article on taxation : they will
know better than to levy tribute on enter
prise. They will place the taxes where
they can't get away, where they will be
readily assessable and where the placing
of them will do the most good. It is not
necpssary to say that they will place it
all on land values. There need be no fear
of the action of the convention. It would
be impossible in these days to frame such
another medieval instrument as our pres
ent constitution to serve as the funda
mental law of an Â«nligntened people."
H. L. Pleece, representative of the Inter
national Bricklayers' Society in the late
Labor Congress, also looks with great
favor upon the movement for a new con
stitution. Hs said:
"There is no doubt that the convention
will make a much better constitution
than we have at present. It could not be
worse. The present constitution is now
twenty years old. No people ought to live
under a constitution longer than that.
GOOD FOR THE
GRAPE-GROWERS
Wine- Makers Decide Upon
an Important Step
Forward.
Prices Likely to Rule Firmer,
Owing to Storage and
Protection.
Interest Cut Downâ Prospects of Re
munerative Figures for the
'96 Crcp.
At the meeting of the board of direc
tors heid la 't Jioixiay, the presi
dent of the W.ne- Makers' Corporation
was instructed to appoint a commit
tee on storage wbosa duties would
be lo provide accommodations in San
Francisco for the wines of those members
requiring early delivery. On this com
mittee the president appointed Directors
P. C. Rossi, B. W. Paiton and Horace B.
Chase, who are now engaged in consider
ing the different propositions made to the
corporation for this purpose.
The numerous brick buildings bordering
on and near the railroad south of Brannan
street afford ample opportunity for select
ing a valuable Bite for the new warehouse.
Many applications have been received
wherein desirable properties are offered at
a rental of from 3 to 4 per cent on a reason
able valuation of the same.
Large tanks will be placed in the ware
house selected, and cooperage for such
purpose can now be had at a cost of one
cent per gallon, and the storage expense,
as computed by the committee, will figure
much less in San Francisco than it now
| costs the wine-maker in the country.
Mich storage in possession of and under
the immediate control of the corporation
improves the value of this security to
such an extent that a much more liberal
advance can ue made on the wines and
the interest charges still further reduced.
The corporation has during the past
year cut the interest down from 10 to 8
per cent, and will by this means be able
to carry the wine-maker at 7 per cent.
Since the announcement of this plan by
the corporation tnere nave come to it
a Hood of applications from large dealers
in the East who desire to handle ti.e cor
poration's wines as soon as they are able to
cci them in shape for shipment. A prom
inent dealer of lormer days, whose trade
is somewhat contracted, has offered his
premise-* at a nominal cost and service! in
preparing the wine for market.
No action of the corporation has met
with such si, â  Mg and unqualified appro
val by the members as this, and they have
indicated their pleasure and rejoicing at
what s-fms to be a probable breaking
away irom the bondage of yeais gone by.
It is not the wish of the directors to en
gage in the wine business, but this pro
tective measure is likely to invite one
step further, which would mean the whole
sale marketing of their own goods. The
strong determination of the corporation
members lo is sell their wines at not less
than 20 cents per gallon, and this, re
enforced by the proposad addition to the
duty on wines, whereby the protection is
raised irom 30 to 60 cents per gallon, in
jures remunerative figures for the '96 crop.
This doubling of the duty, as announced
The world moves, and what may have
been just the thing twenty years ago is
necessarily oat of tune with the spirit of
to-lay. We need a new constitution, and
I am plad we are to get it."
H. D. Wagnor of San Jose, in the City
yesterday, was much interested in the
proipect of a change. He said:
"The increasing number oi amendments
being offered to tbe constitution is alone
sufficient to indicate that the instrument
is all at fault with the spirit of the time.
It chafes. It will be modernized, and I
say, -Speed the day.' "
Mayor Phelan had read the article in
The Call of yesterday containing an ac
count of the passage of the resolution in
the Legislature Jast Wednesday, but he
did not care to express a set opinion for
publication without further consideration
of the matter. He was asked what amend
ments to the constitution he would favor,
and he replied that, perhaps, the most
important ones in his estimation were
home rule for cities, life tenure of faithful
public servants; larger powers to munici
palities looking toward municipal owner
ship of public utilities and the engrafting
of the civil-service system upon munici
palities.
With reference to the single-tax propo
sition the Mayor said (hat he had not yet
committed himself to it, but was now
seriously studying the matter.
"Keal estate pays about 90 per cent of
the taxes," ne said, "so the change to the
single-tax system would not be such a
violent one as some of the others which
miight be made by a constitutional con
vention."
Superior Judge Carroll Cook was of the
opinion that if the peopie would return to
the old constitution of twenty years aeo
it would probably be better for the whole
people.
"The present constitution is not so good
as the old one," added the Judge, "but
we have settled it in the courts after
twenty years of trial and the people have
become accustomed to it. Business af
fairs have been shaped by it, and the evil
effects first following its introduction
have passed away. It is not a good thing
to have a new constitutional convention.
It is likely to cause a violent disturDauce
in the business world and to upset things
generally, and the only good it does is to
give the lawyers more business. In addi
tion to ail that, it is a tremendous ex
pense to the taxpayers."
City and County Attorney Creswell
had not given the matter that considera
tion to which it was entitled, but, speak
ing on the wing, he thought that consti
tutional amendments were ill considered,
and usually proposed to meet some end,
and not always by those who do not un
derstand the question in its broadest ap
plication to municipal and govern
mental needs. Tinkering with tne consti
tution was a dangerous matter at best in
his opinion, but there were, no doubt,
Â«ome amendments that would be pro
ductive of considerable good. An inter
mediate Court of Appeals would be an. in
novation greatiy to be desired, a court
such as exists in the Uniied States courts,
to lighten the onerous burdens on the
shoulders of the Supreme Court. The
mission of such a court would be to dis
pose of many cases which now go tD the
Supreme Court, and thereby lessen the
vexatious and costly delays with which
litigants are now unavoidably harassed.
In many classes of cases the intermediate
court wouid be the court of last resort.
City and County Treasurer Wdber had
not thought much upon the subject, but
would be in favor of changing the consti
tution of the State so as to give San Fran
cisco local sell-government. Uws and
systems which might work well in country
districts with a small and scattered popu
lation would be very unsatisfactory in a
City like San Francisco, where the popula
tion wa a large and dense.
Mr. Widber found during his experi
ence in the Treasurer's office that the
present mode of collecting property taxes
and allowing rebates is very faulty, being
cuniDersonie and unnecessarily expensive.
in the tariff bill now before the House, is
the occaMon for great rejoicio* among
both the wine makers and dealers.
UNDER AMERICAN COLORS.
A >'ew lav Relating to Registering
Vessels Once Foreign. -V
The Collector of Customs yesterday re
ceived instructions from the Department
of Navigation at Washington relative to
the registering of vessels sold to foreign
ers. Under the old law no vessel that had
Deen made in the United States and
carried the American flag and then sold
to foreigners, or carried a foreign nag,
was entitled to be re- registered upon again
becoming the property of an American;
and lurther no vessel was entitled to be
registered if owned in whole or in part by
any citizen of the Umied States who usu
ally resided in a foreign country. To tins
there was an exception in favor of United
States Consuls and members of firms or
houses of trade of citizens of the United
States.
The new law is of much importance and
reads as follow?:
That section 4165, R. S., be and Is hereby
amended to read as follows :
Section 4163. A vessel registered pursuant
to law which by sale has become ttie property
of a foreigner shall be ontitled to a new
register upon afterward becoming American
property, unless it has been enlaiged or un
dergone change outmde of the United States.
FIGHTING THREE SALOONS
"Irish Tavern," "Bay View" and
"The Shamrock" Condemned
as Notorious.
Respectable Residents Just South of
the Park Will Have No More
cf Them.
War to extermination has been opened
by toe respectable residents of Sunset
Heights upon an oversupply of unrespect
able saloons in that little district just
south o! the park and adjacent to the
Olympic Club grounds.
Recent developments brought on a cli
max.
There are six saloons. Three of them
have not particularly offended. The
"Irish Tavern," the "Bay View" and
"The Shamrock," however, are doomed,
if the protests of the householders of the
neighborhood can prevent the renewal of
their licenses, all of which expire in April.
A wÂ«ek aeo Sunday the proprietor of
the "Irish Tavern," one Patrick Furlong,
was arrested for inhumanely riddling a
dog with bullets and then having it
clubbed to death. lie had wantonly made
a target of the animal; had tied it in the
road, and had taken five shots at it from a
distance of thirty feet. Yesterday be was
found guilty of the charee by Judge
Campbell and was fined $100, with the
alternative of 100 days in jail.
On Sunday last the proprietor of the
Shamrock was arrested for selling liquor
to minors. The arrest was made at the
instigation of R. A. Tuttle, who has a lit
tle home in tbe neighborhood. It was he
that pressed the charge of cruelty to ani
mals against the propietor of the Irish
Tavern.
Immediately after this latestoffense Mr.
Tuttle drew up a petition and yesterday
in a short i me obtained the signatures of
over twenty property-holders, who, with
himÂ«elf, will appeal to ihe .board of Su
pervisors not to reissue licenses to these
three saloons. That his fearless stand is
not an enviahle one may be inferred from
the fact that forty women property-owners
in hearty sympathy witn the movement
were afraid to sign the petition lest they
might be made to suffer from the element
of wnich, particularly on Sui days, they
are in constant dread.
If your printer can't get the "Genuine Bank
Stock" pa^er, send to My sell-Rollins, 22 Clay.*
It bad been already condemned by tbe
Grand Jury and tbe county officials, all of
whom to a unit were opposed to it.
Assessor Siebe talked vary freely on the
subject. There was much room for re
form in the constitution, he said, but ti.e
one solid reform was the single tax.
"The longer I am here," added Mr.
Siebe, "the more convinced am I that rtie
single tax is neces ary. Tbe present
method of assessment is a farce, because
in the great majority of cases all property
is not given in to the Assessor in the
statements, and it is next to impossible
for him to find it. There are honorable
exceptions to tbe rule, however. One is
Claus Spreckels, who pave in his state
ment two years ago $1,000,000 in cash to
be assessed lor the purpose of bejng taxed.
This was (he hignest money assessment I
ever had from any single individual. If
he hadn't given it in to me I never could
havp found it. Last year he gave in
$278,000. I am satsfied that there are
other individuals who had just as much
money, but I could not get the evidence.
"The single-tax system would largely
reduce the expenses of my office. Under
the present system anybody can get tno
better of the Assessor by concealing Der
sonal property, bui land can always be
found. My olfice, were it not for the cost
of collecting personal property taxes,
could be run for $30,000 le<s. Then there
is the annoyance and the temptation that
is laid before them to commit perjury
making their statement.
"Then, again, especially in the case of
people who have personal property unse
cured by real estate, you have to go to a
dozen times in tbe attempt to collect from
them. It is all right in the country, but
we have 30,000 people in this City from
whom we have to collect this tax.
"The law says that I shall seize the
identical property I assess. Now, it is
next to impossible to collect from ships if
they did not wish to Day, but they gen
erally pay. We go to the books at the
Custom-house to assess ships, but when
we go to collect they are off in some other
part of the world.
"If c. constitutional convention should
be decided upon by the peopie we could
get together and suggest such reforms as
our experience has taught us are neces
sary. I think the sentiment of the people
is in favor of a new constitution."
Tax Collector Block was not prepared to
express a decided opinion on the subject,
but he was in favor of amending the con
stitution, allowing special legislation in tbe
case of the City and County of San Fran
cisco.
"The collection of taxes in this City is
of such maKniiudeand the system is so
different from what, obtains in the coun
try that the same rule cannot be applied
to both. Under the present constitution
we cannot make a special las? for the City
and County of San Francisco. It is a
good thing to prohibit special legislation,
but it is a little unfortunate that the same
revenue laws must apply generally
throughout the State.
"The constitution should be amended,' 1
continued Mr. Block 4 , "so as to give
municipal corporations of a certain popu
lation the exclusive right to collect their
revenues in their own way and not allow
the Legislature to have anything to do
with it. Assessments should be regulated
in the same way. If we could elect a con
stitutional convention consisting of men
of integrity and knowledge and business
requirements and who are familiar with
the needs of the various counties and
municipalities of the State it would be
a good thing to have such a convention."
Police Judge Campbell favored the call
ing of a convention. "There should be,"
he said, "a change in the constitution, so
as to allow metropolitan cities to frame
their own government. There are other
instances in which we must have special
legislation."
Chief of Police Crowley said that it
would be a very good plan to call a consti
tutional convention, for the present con
stitution had not given satisfaction to the
people.
ATTORNEY KNIGHT
FLITS EASTWARD
Follows Charles L. Fair to
the Wiles of Gotham-
Town.
A Journey for Health That In
cidentally Had Other
Orj cts.
Talkative Pecple Say the Lawyer and
His Client Are Avoiding the
Grand Jury.
Attorney George A. Knight is off for
New York and Philadelphia. He left sud
denly Sunday night, and beyond a de
claration that "urgent business has called
him E.ist" his most intimate friends
know nothing definite of the objects of
his mission East.
The Grand Jury will convene to-day to
further investigate the charges of con
spiracy and forgery which the Fair chil
dren have been assiduously circulating
against Mrs. Nettie R. Craven and the so
called pencil deeds for the past few
months. As it happens, these matters
were officially brought to the notice of the
Grand Jury by Charles L. Fair shortly
after he secured Notary James J. Cooney's
arrest on a charge of perjury in connec
tion witn the acknowledgments on the
deeds. There was some hesitancy on the
part of the jurors to act in the case, as
another phase of it was about to be tried
in the civil courts. Young Fair, how
ever, was persistent. He secured the good
sei vices of Captain Lees, and alter much
worry and lobbying he managed to get
the jury to consider the evidence brought,
out in the preliminary examination of
Cooney.
All this was six weeks ago, and when
the jurors were ready for action Fair sud
denly left the City. There were those who
wondered why the young millionaire
should hurry away from the City when
hit presencein the inquisitorial chamber
would have seemed consistent, in view of
his many efforts to force his litigation
against the pencil deeds into a criminal
Drosecution. Bat young Fair explained
all these little discrepancies very readily.
He was in poor health, he declared, and
needed a change of climate and scenery.
He thought recreation awaited him in the
spot where Ponce de Leon had formerly
sought the fountain .of youth, and
he would spend a couple of months in
Florida.
All this was, of course, natural. Fair
left ostensibly for the tarpon banks and
the land of the alligator, but he must
have changed his mind on the road. At
any rate, instead of going to Florida, the
young millionaire and his wile brought
up in New York. To a man in Door
health the climate of the Eastern metrop
olis, especially in winter, is rather trying.
Fair's ailment, however, was of that Kind
that hehas found life ut the New Nether
lands very agreeable for the past month,
and he has thus far survived the nerve
harrowing noise of Broadway without
showing the least signs of discomfort.
And he has decided to remain there for
another month at least, let the tarpon and
alligator complain as they will.
Now it happens that his attorney follows
him. It was Knight who really advised
the plan of throwing the Fair case into
the criminal courts, much against the

ested in the bonanza millions. It was
Knight wno planned the Grand Jury
coup, and now it seems rather curious
that at the vcrv moment when his pres
ence is needed here he feels it incumbent
to have business East.
Knight, too, is not in good health. Of
late he has been snbject to headaches and
such like, and pofsiblv a course of sprouts
on Broadway and Chestnut street will
effect an improvemen t.
In the meantime the Grand Jury will
have to worry along without young Fair
and his lawyer.
"A SUBDUED MILLIONAIRE."
That Was How the Late Jacob Ward
MtiUh Described Himself.
The will of- Jacob Ward Smith was ad
mitted to probate yesterday in Depart
ment 9 of the Superior Court.
The deceased was at one time a well
known and wealthy resident of the Terri
tory and State of Nevada, having gone to
the Comstock prior even to its territorial
organization. He was a noted member of
the first State Legislature of Nevada. He
was an active and enterprising man, but
in late years suffered from reverses of
fortune and became, as be desciibed him
self, "a subdued millionaire," although
lie had bright hopes of rich results irom
certain ventures which he bequeathed to
his widow and second wife, Mary B. Ca'.d
well Smith.
Smith was first married to Miss Nettie
Kemp of New York, by whom he had
three children, now full grown and resi
dent in the East. By his second wife be
had one child, Percival Ward Smith, now
about five years old. Tie estate is to be
distributed among nis children. The ftnt
wife is to receive $L
When the will was presented there was
some doubt as to its validity because
there was testimony to show that the
testator was married to his second wile
after the making of the original will. On
further questioning by Judge Coffey,
Mrs. Mary Smith testified that the de
cedent said when signing the second
writing, which was on the reverse tide of
the original will, that he intended it as
"a codicil to his will."
For this reason the court decided that
this was a repablication of the orginal
will subsequent to his second marriage
and that the entire instrument was valid
in all respects. The value of the estate
depends on the outcome of some exten
sive mining ventures.
